To that end, we examine a directed search\nmodel with a finite number of agents. We find that the firms\u2019 market power results in\ninefficiencies by causing the misallocation of workers across firms. The policy implications\nare that a minimum wage is always detrimental to welfare while unemployment benefits may\nimprove welfare.\nIn our model workers are homogeneous, firms differ in their productivity and each firm\nhas one vacancy. The split of the surplus is endogenously determined during the hiring\nprocess: first every firm posts a wage and then each worker observes all postings and applies\nfor one job.1 Frictions are introduced by assuming that workers cannot coordinate their\napplication decisions with each other. To study a setting where firms have market power, we\nfocus our attention on a version of this model with a finite number of agents. We show that\nthe decentralized allocation is inefficient: the more (less) productive firms hire less (more)\noften than is optimal; furthermore, unemployment is too low because workers apply to safe\nlow-wage\/low-productivity jobs too frequently.\nThe culprit for the inefficiency is the market power that firms enjoy in a a finite market,\nin the sense that a single firm\u2019s action affects the equilibrium outcomes of all agents. Indeed,\nconstrained efficiency obtains in large markets where firms do not have market power (Moen\n(1997), Shi (2001), Shimer (2005)). Market power reduces the elasticity of the hiring proba-\nbility with respect to the wage and, as a result, all firms post wages that are lower than at the\nefficient benchmark. This redistributes surplus from workers to firms which is a feature that\nis shared with frictionless models of monopsony (Bhaskar, Manning and To (2002)). A novel\nfeature of our model is that the incentive to reduce wages is stronger for high productivity\n(and in equilibrium high-wage) firms which leads them to reduce wages disproportionally.\nThis results in the reallocation of workers from the high- to the low-productivity firms which\nturns out to be inefficient. Furthermore, since high-wage jobs are harder to get, a side-effect\nof this misallocation is that the unemployment rate is lower in the decentralized equilibrium\nthan in the efficient benchmark. Therefore, market power increases employment but reduces\noutput (and hence welfare) by decreasing the average productivity of employed workers. This\nsource of inefficiencies is new to the directed search literature.\nWe examine the welfare effects of two labor market interventions: minimum wages and\n1Most of the directed search literature restricts attention to a single application as a way of capturing\nthe time-consuming aspect of the job-finding process. Multiple applications were recently introduced in\ncontinuum directed search models by Albrecht, Gautier and Vroman (2006), Galenianos and Kircher (2009a)\nand Kircher (2008).\n2\nunemployment benefits. A minimum wage constraints the low productivity firms to offer\nhigher wages than they otherwise would and hence hire even more often than in the origi-\nnal equilibrium, thereby exacerbating the inefficiencies. Introducing unemployment benefits\nresults in the reallocations of workers towards high productivity firms because it improves\nthe outside option of workers effectively reducing the firms\u2019 market power. In one sense,\nunemployment benefits act as a subsidy to search and reduce firms\u2019 market power. This\nis on top of any additional benefits that may be derived from better match formation (e.g.\nMarimon and Zilibotti (1999)). In terms of employment effects, introducing a minimum wage\n(unemployment benefits) reallocates workers to the low (high) productivity firms; since low\nproductivity firms offer a higher probability of employment, the minimum wage reduces the\nunemployment rate while benefits increase it.2 Therefore, our model shows that evaluating\nthe welfare implications of labor market policy based on their employment effects alone can\nlead to misleading results.\nWe emphasize that even though both policies redistribute surplus towards the workers,\nthey have diametrically opposing effects on aggregate welfare. This is interesting because it\ncontrasts with the predictions of many recent frictional models where both policy instruments\nyield the same qualitative welfare implications (Acemog\u02d8lu and Shimer (1999), Acemog\u02d8lu\n(2001), Manning (2004)).3 However, wages have no allocative role in these models, either\nbecause agents are assumed to be identical or because wages are set through bargaining\nafter a match has formed. When we introduce an allocative role for wages by giving firms\na non-trivial wage-setting decision in an environment with productivity heterogeneity the\nqualitative similarity across policy instruments disappears.4\nThe next section describes the model. Most of the insights of our model can be conveyed\nin the simple setting with two workers and two firms which is examined in Section 3. Section\n4 generalizes our results. We discuss the relevance of our results and conclude in Section 5.\n2 The Environment\nWe begin with a brief description of the environment.\n2These employment effects do not hinge on the finite nature of the market, as we discuss in the conclusions.\nOf course, the policies\u2019 normative effects do depend on the size of the market.\n3These papers span the three most popular classes of labor search models: directed search, random search\nwith bargained wages and random search with posting, respectively. Acemog\u02d8lu and Shimer (1999) do not\nexplicitly consider a minimum wage but it is easy to show that it has the same effect as their prescribed\nunemployment benefits, as also remarked in Acemog\u02d8lu (2001).\n4A different modeling approach is taken by Kaas and Madden (2008). They consider a two-firm Hotelling\nmodel and show that a minimum wage reduces the firms\u2019 market power and leads to a welfare improvement.\nIn that model the wage does play an allocative role.\n3\nThe economy is populated with a finite number of risk-neutral workers and firms, denoted\nby N = {1, ..., n} and M = {1, ...,m} respectively, where n \u2265 2 and m \u2265 2. Each firm j\nhas one vacancy and is characterized by its productivity level xj, where xj > 0 for all j. We\nassume without loss of generality that xm \u2264 xm\u22121 \u2264 ... \u2264 x1 \u2261 x. The productivity of all\nfirms is common knowledge.5 The profits of firm j are equal to xj\u2212wj if it employs a worker\nat wage wj and zero otherwise. All workers are identical and the utility of a worker is equal\nto his wage if employed and zero otherwise.\nThe hiring process has three stages:\n1. Each firm j posts a wage wj \u2208 [0, x].\n2. Workers observe the wage announcement w = {w1, w2, ..., wm} \u2208 [0, x]m and each\nworker simultaneously applies to one firm.\n3. A firm that receives one or more applicants hires one of these workers at random. A\nfirm without applicants remains idle.\nWe focus our attention on equilibria with pure wage-posting strategies by the firms and\nwe solve for the subgame perfect equilibria of the game. As is standard in the directed\nsearch literature, we restrict attention to equilibria where workers follow symmetric strategies.\nSymmetric strategies mean that, following any wage announcement, every worker applies to\nfirm j with the same probability for all j \u2208 M . This assumption rules out coordination\namong workers and it is a natural way of introducing trading frictions.6 It is straightforward\nto extend this environment to introduce our two policy variables: a minimum wage puts a\nlower bound on the wages that firms can post; unemployment benefits increase the value of\nremaining unemployed. This is the standard directed search environment, for instance as in\nBurdett, Shi and Wright (2001, henceforth BSW).7\n5The case where productivity levels are private information is examined in Galenianos and Kircher (2007).\n6Lack of coordination may seem incompatible with a finite (or, small) labor market. What we have in\nmind is that the labor market for some occupation may have a small number of participants while the total\nnumber of agents in the geographical vicinity is large enough to preclude coordination among them.\n7We take the trading mechanism and the associated coordination failures as given. The coordination\nproblem would be less severe if the contracts were posted by the workers rather than the firms, as in Coles\nand Eeckhout (2003a, 2003b). However, in that environment the firms do not obtain any surplus and they\nwould therefore prefer to offer the contracts themselves rather than apply for workers\u2019 services if given the\nchoice. Analyzing the effects of competing markets is beyond the scope of our paper (see Halko, Kultti\nand Virrankoski (2008) for such a model). Virag (2008) considers a model of competing mechanisms with\nfinite markets where the firms take their market power into account, but that paper assumes that firms are\nhomogeneous.\n4\n3 The Case of Two Workers and Two Firms\nWe begin our analysis by examining the case where n = m = 2 and x1 > x2.\n8 We find\nit fruitful to start with this case as it allows for a simple characterization of the subgame\nwhile preserving the strategic interaction among the agents. The general case is considered\nin section 4.\nThis section\u2019s results are the following.\nProposition 3.1 When n = m = 2 and x1 > x2:\n1. Equilibrium Characterization: A unique directed search equilibrium exists. The more\nproductive firm posts a higher wage (w1 > w2).\n2. Efficiency Properties: Constrained efficiency does not obtain in equilibrium. The low\nproductivity firm hires too often and unemployment is too low from an efficiency view-\npoint. The firms\u2019 market power is the source of the inefficiency.\n3. Policy Implications: Introducing a binding minimum wage reduces welfare. There exists\na (strictly positive) level of unemployment benefits that leads to the constrained efficient\nallocation.\n3.1 Equilibrium Characterization\nWe show that there exists a unique equilibrium and that the high productivity firm offers a\nhigher wage. Even though this result is not new (or surprising), we think the proof is useful\nfor the efficiency analysis of the following section.\nThe model is solved by backwards induction. The first step is to derive the equilibrium\nresponse of the two workers for an arbitrary wage announcement {w1, w2}. To facilitate\nexposition the two workers are named A and B. Suppose that worker B\u2019s strategy is to\nvisit firm j with probability pBj . We proceed to derive the probability that worker A is hired\nconditional on applying to firm j, which we denote by G(pBj ). Worker B applies to firm\nk (6= j) with probability 1 \u2212 pBj , in which case A is hired for sure; with probability pBj , B\napplies to firm j and A is hired with probability 1\/2. Therefore:\nG(pBj ) = (1\u2212 pBj ) +\npBj\n2\n=\n2\u2212 pBj\n2\n. (1)\n8The case where x1 = x2 and n = m = 2 is exhaustively analyzed by BSW.\n5\nThe expected utility that worker A receives from applying to firm j is equal to G(pBj )wj =\n[(2\u2212 pBj ) wj]\/2 and similarly for B. Finally, in a symmetric subgame we have pAj = pBj = pj.\nWe define market utility to be the utility that workers expect to receive in the equilibrium\nof the subgame and denote it by U(w1, w2) \u2261 maxj G(pj) wj. When wj \u2265 2wk, applying to\nfirm j is a dominant strategy for the workers which leads to\npj = 1, pk = 0 and U(w1, w2) =\nwj\n2\n. (2)\nWhen wj\/wk \u2208 [1\/2, 2], workers mix (pl > 0 for l = 1, 2). Their strategies and market utility\nare given by:\n(2\u2212 pj) wj\n2\n=\n(2\u2212 pk) wk\n2\n= U(w1, w2). (3)\nEquations (2) and (3) define the optimal response of workers {p1(w1, w2), p2(w1, w2)} for\narbitrary wages {w1, w2}. We shall show that only equation (3) is relevant for equilibrium.\nWe now turn to the firms\u2019 problem in the first stage of the hiring process. Let H(pj)\ndenote the probability that firm j fills its vacancy when the workers\u2019 strategy is to apply to\nj with probability pj. Firm j hires a worker unless it receives no applicants, which occurs\nwith probability (1\u2212 pj)2. Therefore, H(pj) = 1\u2212 (1\u2212 pj)2.\nFirm j takes as given the wage of firm k and the response of workers and maximizes\n\u03a0j(wj, wk) \u2261 (xj \u2212 wj)H(pj(wj, wk)) (4)\nover wj \u2208 [0, xj]. Note that firm j has no incentive to post a wage above 2wk since that wage\nattracts both workers with probability 1. Therefore, in equilibrium pj(wj, wk) is determined\nby equation (3) alone.\nDifferentiating equation (4) with respect to wj yields:\nd\u03a0j(wj, wk)\ndwj\n= (xj \u2212 wj)H \u2032(pj(wj, wk))dpj(wj, wk)\ndwj\n\u2212H(pj(wj, wk)) (5)\nThe first term captures the marginal benefit of raising the wage, i.e. the increase in the\nhiring probability times productivity. The second term represents the cost of having to pay\na higher wage to workers. We will use this expression extensively for the efficiency analysis.\nIt will prove convenient to optimize over pj rather than wj. Using equation (3) one can\nexpress wj as a function of pj and wk which, recalling that pk = 1\u2212 pj, leads to wj(pj, wk) =\n6\n(1 + pj) wk\/(2\u2212 pj). With a bit of algebra, equation (4) can be rewritten as\n\u03a0j[wj(pj, wk), wk] = xj(1\u2212 (1\u2212 pj)2)\u2212 wkpj(1 + pj), (6)\nand it is maximized over pj \u2208 [0, 1]. The first derivative is:\nd\u03a0j[wj(pj, wk), wk]\ndpj\n= 2 (1\u2212 pj) xj \u2212 (1 + 2 pj) wk. (7)\nWe equate (7) to zero for both firms, solve for xj and combine terms, using equation (3)\nto substitute out wages, to get:\nx1\nx2\n=\n1\u2212 p2\n1\u2212 p1\n1 + 2 p1\n1 + 2 p2\n2\u2212 p1\n2\u2212 p2 (8)\nEquation (8) implicitly characterizes the equilibrium. It is straightforward to show that\nthere are unique {p\u22171(x1, x2), p\u22172(x1, x2)} satisfying (8). Let R(p1) denote the right hand side\nof equation (8), where p2 = 1\u2212 p1. Simple calculations show that R(0) = 0, R\u2032(p1) > 0 and\nlimp1\u21921 R(p1) = \u221e proving that there is a unique p\u22171 (and p\u22172) satisfying (8) and hence the\nequilibrium exists and it is unique.\nThe equilibrium wages are given by using equation (7):\nw\u2217k(x1, x2) =\n2(1\u2212 p\u2217j(x1, x2)) xj\n1 + 2 p\u2217j(x1, x2)\n. (9)\nThe symmetry of (8) and x1 > x2 imply p\n\u2217\n1 > 1\/2 > p\n\u2217\n2 and hence w\n\u2217\n1 > w\n\u2217\n2. Note that p\n\u2217\n1\nis strictly interior regardless of x1 and x2. In other words, the high productivity firm finds\nit suboptimal to price its competitor out of the market.9 Finally, recalling equation (1), the\nexpected unemployment rate of the decentralized equilibrium is:\nu\u2217 = p\u22171 (1\u2212 p\u22171 +\np\u22171\n2\n) + p\u22172 (1\u2212 p\u22172 +\np\u22172\n2\n) =\n1\n2\n[1 + 2 p\u22171 \u2212 2 (p\u22171)2] (10)\n3.2 Efficiency Properties of Equilibrium\nWe now examine the efficiency properties of the equilibrium. We have two main results: first,\nefficiency does not obtain; second, the pattern of inefficiency is that the low productivity firm\nhires too often and unemployment is too low. We identify the market power enjoyed by firms\nin a finite market as the culprit for the inefficiency.\n9This result is particular to the two firm case. In the general m-firm model additional assumptions on\nproductivity are needed to guarantee that all firms attract applications. See Galenianos and Kircher (2009b).\n7\nOur benchmark for efficiency is the solution to the following problem: a social planner\nchooses the strategies of the agents to maximize output subject to the constraint that workers\u2019\nstrategies are symmetric.10 The constraint means that the planner is subject to the same\nfrictions as the agents, and we call the solution to his problem the constrained efficient\nbenchmark. This is the standard notion of constrained efficiency in a decentralized matching\nprocess as in Shi (2001) or Shimer (2005).\nThe firms\u2019 strategies (wage-posting) are irrelevant for efficiency since they only affect the\ndistribution of the surplus. Therefore, the planner chooses the workers\u2019 strategies to solve\nmax\np1,p2\nx1 H(p1) + x2 H(p2) (11)\ns.t. p1 + p2 = 1 and pj \u2265 0, j = 1, 2.\nLet {pP1 , pP2 } denote the solution of this problem.\nThe trade-off faced by the social planner is the following: by increasing p1, he raises the\naverage productivity of an employed worker because the high productivity firm is left idle\nless often; however, he also reduces the number of employed workers since they crowd each\nother out more often at the high productivity firm (p1 > 1\/2 is clearly a necessary condition\nfor efficiency). We proceed to show that the decentralized equilibrium does not strike the\nwelfare-maximizing balance between these two forces.\nSetting the first derivative of (11) to zero yields\nx1\nx2\n=\n1\u2212 pP2\n1\u2212 pP1\n, (12)\nComparing equation (12) with equilibrium condition (8) it is clear that constrained efficiency\ndoes not obtain in equilibrium, except in the special case x1 = x2.\nFurthermore, simple calculations show that the product of the second and third ratios on\nthe right hand side of (8) is larger than 1 which implies that (1\u2212p\u22172)\/(1\u2212p\u22171) < (1\u2212pP2 )\/(1\u2212\npP1 ), and therefore\npP2 < p\n\u2217\n2 <\n1\n2\n< p\u22171 < p\nP\n1 . (13)\nThat is, in equilibrium workers apply to the less productive firm too often. As a result, the\nunemployment rate is too low from an efficiency viewpoint: equation (10) is minimized at\np1 = 1\/2 which, together with equation (13), leads to u\n\u2217 < uP .\n10In other words, the planner has a utilitarian welfare function.\n8\nMarket power is the source of the inefficiency. Market power refers to the fact that an\nindividual firm\u2019s action alters the workers\u2019 market utility. To clarify this point, use equation\n(3) to rewrite the probability that a worker applies to firm j as\npj = pj[U,wj] = 2(1\u2212 U\/wj), (14)\nwhere, of course, U = U(w1, w2). A change in wj affects pj[wj, U ] through two distinct\nchannels. The directed search channel is that as a firm raises its wage, workers increase their\nprobability of applying there. The market power channel is that a single firm\u2019s wage affects\nthe workers\u2019 market utility and hence their strategies. Mathematically:\ndpj\ndwj\n=\n\u2202pj\n\u2202wj\n+\n\u2202pj\n\u2202U\n\u2202U\n\u2202wj\n(15)\nIt is straightforward to show that the constrained efficient allocation obtains if the market\npower channel is shut off (i.e. if \u2202U\/\u2202wj = 0). For instance, this is the case in Montgomery\n(1991) who considers a similar model but assumes that firms behave competitively in that\nthey take market utility as fixed when deciding what wage to post. Furthermore, Peters\n(2000) shows that market power diminishes as the number of agents grows which is consistent\nwith the findings of Moen (1997), Shi (2001) and Shimer (2005) that constrained efficiency\nobtains in large markets.\nTo see why market power leads low productivity firms to \u201coverhire\u201d we examine equation\n(15) in some more detail. First, note that \u2202pj\/\u2202U < 0: a better outside option makes workers\nmore picky. Second, observe that in a finite market we have \u2202U\/\u2202wj > 0: as wj increases,\nworkers apply more often to firm j and, therefore, less often to firm k; this makes it easier\nto be hired at firm k, which leads to an increase in G(pk)wk and hence in market utility.\nNote that when the number of agents becomes large this argument ceases to hold because\nthe queues at other firms are affected infinitesimally as workers increase their probability of\napplying to j. Therefore, in a large market the expected utility of applying to some other\nfirm k remains unchanged and pj increases sufficiently to bring the payoffs of applying to j\ndown to its previous level.\nThese observations imply that market power decreases the elasticity of hiring with respect\nto the wage by reducing the right-hand side of equation (15). As a result, firms face less\ncompetition and they post lower wages than they would if they did not take their market\npower into consideration, as in Montgomery (1991). The reason why the high productivity\nfirm is affected by this feature to a larger amount has to do with the strict concavity of the\nhiring function H(pj). Recalling equation (5), it is easy to see that a unit decrease in dpj\/dwj\n9\nhas a smaller effect on the hiring probability of the high wage (and hence high productivity)\nfirm. Therefore, the high productivity firm will respond to market power by decreasing its\nwage by a larger amount, which leads to the misallocation of workers.\nThe firms\u2019 market power therefore leads to a redistribution of surplus from workers to\nfirms, which does not enter our welfare criterion, but also to a reduction in expected output\ndue to the misallocation of workers across heterogeneous firms, which does. The source of\nthe inefficiencies is different from the underutilization of labor suggested by more common\nfrictionless models of monopsony (e.g. Bhaskar, Manning and To (2002)). The result that in\nequilibrium workers under-apply to the more productive firms and face lower unemployment\nthan is optimal is similar in flavor to Acemog\u02d8lu and Shimer (1999). The driving force in that\npaper, however, is the workers\u2019 risk aversion, while in this paper it is the firms\u2019 market power.\nMore importantly, the focus of the two papers is quite different: we focus on the interaction\nbetween policy and firms\u2019 pricing decisions while Acemog\u02d8lu and Shimer (1999) concentrate\non how to counter the effects of workers\u2019 risk aversion.\n3.3 Policy implications\nThe next step is to examine whether policy can improve on the decentralized allocation. We\nconsider two policy interventions: a minimum wage and unemployment benefits. Our findings\nare that the introduction of a minimum wage exacerbates the misallocation of workers while\nan unemployment benefits scheme can achieve constrained efficiency. We provide a discussion\nof these results at the end of the section.\nWe first consider the minimum wage and show that a binding minimum wage results in\nthe reductions of more productive firm\u2019s hiring probability. Fix the original economy {x1, x2},\nlabel the equilibrium before the introduction of a (binding) minimum wage as unconstrained\nand denote the equilibrium wages and application probabilities by {w\u22171(x1, x2), w\u22172(x1, x2)}\nand {p\u22171, p\u22172}. Introduce a minimum wage in the interval w \u2208 (w\u22172(x1, x2), x2),11 and label the\nresulting equilibrium as constrained with associated wages and probabilities {wC1 (x1, x2, w), w}\nand {pC1 , pC2 }.12\nThe constrained equilibrium of economy {x1, x2} features the same wages and probabilities\nas the unconstrained equilibrium of an alternative economy {x1, x\u02dc2} where w is the low\nproductivity firm\u2019s profit maximizing wage. In other words, the alternative economy is such\n11A minimum wage below w\u22172(x1, x2) has no effect because it does not bind, while if w \u2265 x2 the low\nproductivity firm is priced out of the market. It is clear from equation (12) that it is never efficient to leave\none of the firms without applications. Depending on parameter values, closing firm 2 down could improve\nefficiency but this is not a policy that we will consider.\n12Set w2 = w in equation (7) and solve for w1.\n10\nthat w\u22172(x1, x\u02dc2) = w and w\n\u2217\n1(x1, x\u02dc2) = w\nC\n1 (x1, x2, w). It is straightforward to see that x\u02dc2 > x2\nwhich implies that the low productivity firm of the alternative economy hires more often than\nits counterpart in the original economy. Therefore, introducing a minimum wage leads to\nlow productivity firm to hire more often, pushing the economy further away from efficiency:\npP1 > p\n\u2217\n1 > p\nC\n1 . Note, however, that the expected unemployment rate decreases as a result of\nthe minimum wage: uC < u\u2217 < uP .\nWe now consider an unemployment benefits scheme that gives b (< x2) to every worker\nwho was unable to find a job and is financed by lump-sum taxation.13 This scheme is\nsimply a redistribution of resources and therefore it does not affect the efficient allocation.\nFor the equilibrium analysis, we normalize all values by the unemployment benefits: let\nx\u02c6j = xj \u2212 b and w\u02c6j = wj \u2212 b be the productivity and wage, respectively, in excess of the\nworkers\u2019 unemployment benefits (or, outside option). Treating x\u02c6j as the firms productivity\nand w\u02c6 as the wage, the equilibrium can be characterized in the same way as in section 3.1.\nEquation (8) becomes\nx1 \u2212 b\nx2 \u2212 b =\n1\u2212 p2(b)\n1\u2212 p1(b)\n1 + 2 p1(b)\n1 + 2 p2(b)\n2\u2212 p1(b)\n2\u2212 p2(b) (16)\nEquation (16) defines the equilibrium worker strategies for given b, p1(b). The ratio (x1 \u2212\nb)\/(x2 \u2212 b) is strictly increasing in b and p1(b) can achieve any value in [p\u22171, 1) by varying b\nwithin [0, x2). p1(x2) = 1 is too high because it is inefficient to price the low productivity\nfirm out of the market and p1(0) is too low, as was shown in section 3.2. Therefore, there is\na unique b\u2217 \u2208 (0, x2) such that p1(b\u2217) = pP1 and efficiency is restored.\nThe main lesson of section 3.2 is that the market power of firms leads to inefficiencies.\nThis, of course, is not a new result. What is novel in our model is how the inefficiencies mani-\nfest themselves and the resulting implications with respect to two policies that can reduce the\nfirms\u2019 market power. In contrast to frictionless models of monopsony where the inefficiencies\nare due to the underutilization of labor and where a (carefully chosen) minimum wage helps\nmove towards efficiency, our model shows that the allocative inefficiencies are important and\nthey are actually made worse by a minimum wage. A minimum wage constraints the low\nproductivity firms to offer higher wages than they otherwise would and hence hire even more\noften than in the original, already inefficient, equilibrium. In some sense, the minimum wage\n13Of course, in reality taxation is distortionary. Our goal is to examine whether unemployment benefits\ncan improve the allocation in the most favorable environment possible: if the answer is negative, then a more\nrealistic assessment of taxation is unnecessary; if, as already anticipated, the answer is positive, then one can\nconsider different taxation schemes \u2013which we leave for future research.\n11\nmostly affects the low productivity firms which are not principally responsible for the ineffi-\nciency. Therefore, even though the minimum wage results in a redistribution of surplus from\nfirms to workers, it also reduces aggregate welfare. Introducing an appropriately measured\nunemployment benefits scheme can help overcome the inefficiencies. The reason is that un-\nemployment benefits introduce a positive fallback option for the workers in case they do not\nget the job and this option is exercised with higher probability when a worker applies to the\nhigh productivity firm. Therefore, the workers are willing to take more \u201crisk\u201d which induces\nhigh productivity firms to offer higher wages.\nIt is worth reiterating that in other frictional models that exhibit inefficiencies, but where\nprices do not have an allocative role, the welfare effects of introducing a minimum wage are\nqualitatively similar to those of introducing unemployment benefits, unlike the results of our\nmodel. For instance, see Acemog\u02d8lu and Shimer (1999), Acemog\u02d8lu (2001) or Manning (2004).\n4 The General Case\nWe now extend our results to the general case of arbitrary but finite numbers of workers\nand firms. We replicate the analysis of section 3. The existence and characterization of\nequilibrium is analyzed in Galenianos and Kircher (2009b) so section 4.1 simply describes\nthe model. The subsequent sections generalize our inefficiency result and examine the effects\nof policy.\n4.1 Equilibrium Characterization\nIn this section we describe the agents\u2019 maximization problem for the general case of n workers\nand m firms.\nThe strategy of worker i specifies the probability with which he applies to each firm after\nobserving a particular announcement w = (w1, w2, ..., wm). Let p\ni\nj(w) denote the probability\nthat worker i applies to firm j after observing w. Since workers follow symmetric strategies,\nwe have pij(w) = p\nl\nj(w) = pj(w), for all i, l \u2208 N . We denote the strategy of all workers with\nthe vector p(w) = (p1(w), ..., pm(w)).\nConsider a worker who applies to firm j. The probability that he is hired depends on the\nnumber of other workers that have applied for the same job. When there are exactly nj other\nworkers at firm j, our worker gets the job with probability 1\/(nj + 1). The number of other\nworkers that visit firm j follows a binomial distribution with parameters (pj, n \u2212 1) when\ntheir strategy is to apply to firm j with probability pj. It is straightforward to sum over the\n12\nbinomial coefficients and derive that the probability of being hired by firm j is given by\nG(pj) =\n1\u2212 (1\u2212 pj)n\nn pj\n,\nwhere G(0) \u2261 limpj\u21920G(pj) = 1.14 Also, let g(pj) \u2261 G\u2032(pj) = \u2212[G(pj) \u2212 (1\u2212 pj)n\u22121]\/pj for\npj > 0 and g(0) \u2261 limpj\u21920 g(pj) = \u2212(n\u2212 1)\/2.\nThe worker\u2019s expected utility from applying to firm j is G(pj) vj. Utility maximization\nimplies that the expected utility received by a worker is the same at all the firms where he\napplies, i.e. G(pj)wj = G(pk)wk = U(w), whenever pj, pk > 0. Define uj(w) \u2261 g(pj(w)) wj.\nFirm j hires a worker unless it receives no applicants which occurs with probability\n(1\u2212 pj)n. Therefore, firm j hires with probability\nH(pj) = 1\u2212 (1\u2212 pj)n.\nDefine h(pj) \u2261 H \u2032(pj) = n (1\u2212 pj)n\u22121.\nFirm j takes as given the announcements of the other firms, w\u2212j, and the response of\nworkers in the subgame, p(w). Firm j maximizes its expected profits:\n\u03a0j(wj,w\u2212j) = (xj \u2212 wj)H(pj(w)). (17)\nProfits are uniquely determined given w since each announcement leads to a unique set of\napplication probabilities in the subgame (Peters (1984)).\nGalenianos and Kircher (2009b) prove the existence of an equilibrium in pure strategies\nby firms. Furthermore, under an additional condition it is shown that the equilibrium is\ncharacterized by the firms\u2019 first order conditions and that more productive firms post higher\nwages and firms with the same productivity post the same wage. The condition (Assumption\n3 in that paper) guarantees that all firms attract applicants with positive probability (pj > 0\nfor all j) and it is given by:\nC1: For all j \u2208M we have pj(w) > 0 where w = (x1, ..., , xm).\nIt is easy to show that Condition C1 holds as long as the maximum wages that firms are\nwilling to offer are not too far apart, i.e. there exists parameter \u03b3 < 1 such that C1 holds if\nminj xj > \u03b3maxj xj. Note that Condition C1 is sufficient but not necessary for our results.\n14See Burdett, Shi and Wright (2001) for a detailed derivation.\n13\nConsider the firms\u2019 problem. Under (C1), all firms attract applications and the solu-\ntions to the firms\u2019 problem are characterized by their first order conditions. The first order\nconditions of the firm\u2019s problem are\nd\u03a0j\ndwj\n= \u2212H(pj) + h(pj) [xj \u2212 wj] dpj\ndwj\n. (18)\nEquating (18) to zero for all j and rearranging leads to:\nxj\nxk\n=\nh(pk)\nh(pj)\nh(pj) wj +\nH(pj)\ndpj\/dwj\nh(pk) wk +\nH(pk)\ndpk\/dwk\n, (19)\nwhich characterizes the equilibrium. Let {p\u22171, ..., p\u2217m} denote the equilibrium allocation.\n4.2 Efficiency Properties of Equilibrium\nWe now generalize the results of section 3.2. We show that constrained efficiency does not\nobtain except for the special case of homogeneous firms and that in equilibrium the more\nproductive firms hire less frequently than is efficient.\nThe planner\u2019s optimization problem is given by\nmax\np\nm\u2211\nj=1\nH(pj) xj (20)\ns.t.\nm\u2211\nj=1\npj = 1 and pj \u2265 0 \u2200j \u2208M\nLet {pP1 , ..., pPm} denote the planner\u2019s constrained efficient allocation.\nEquation (20) yields the following first order conditions:\nh(pj) xj \u2264 \u03bb\n= \u03bb if pj > 0, \u2200j \u2208M,\nwhere \u03bb is the Lagrange multiplier. This condition requires that the shadow value in terms\nof expected output is equal across all firms that attract applications. Therefore, for any two\nfirms j and k with pj, pk > 0 the following has to hold:\nxj\nxk\n=\nh(pPk )\nh(pPj )\n= (\n1\u2212 pPk\n1\u2212 pPj\n)n\u22121. (21)\n14\nComparing the efficiency requirement (21) with the equilibrium condition (19) reveals that\nefficiency is only achieved when the second ratio of (19) is equal to one for all pairs of firms.\nThis can be easily verified to hold for the case when firms are homogeneous (x1 = ... = xm)\nand workers apply to each firm with identical probability (Galenianos and Kircher (2009b)\nestablish that homogeneous firms post the same wage and therefore efficiency obtains in that\ncase). However, we will show that when firms are heterogeneous, this ratio is different from\none.\nThe proposition states our results regarding the efficiency properties of equilibrium. The\nproof is in the appendix.\nProposition 4.1 Assume (C1) holds.\n(1) If xj 6= xk for some j, k \u2208M , then constrained efficiency does not obtain in equilibrium.\nFurthermore, there exists an r \u2208 {1, 2, ...,m} such that p\u2217j < pPj for j \u2208 {1, ..., r} and p\u2217j > pPj\nfor j \u2208 {r + 1, ....,m}.\n(2) If xj = xk for all j, k \u2208M , then constrained efficiency obtains in equilibrium.\nProof. See the appendix.\n4.3 Policy Implications\nWe now generalize the policy implications of section 3.3. We first show analytically that\nthe results of section 3.3 hold when firms have two productivity levels. We then provide\nsome computational evidence that they extend to more general productivity distributions,\nalthough we have not been able to provide a proof.\nLet x1 > x2 and suppose thatm1 andm2 is the number of high and low productivity firms,\nrespectively. Assume that condition (C1) holds. The characterization results in Galenianos\nand Kircher (2009b) guarantee that in the unconstrained equilibrium all high productivity\nfirms post w\u22171 and all low productivity firms post w\n\u2217\n2.\nWe first consider the welfare effect of imposing a binding minimum wage:\nProposition 4.2 Aggregate welfare is strictly higher in any unconstrained equilibrium {w\u22171, w\u22172}\nthan at an equilibrium with a minimum wage w \u2208 (w\u22172, x2).\nProof. See the appendix.\nIn contrast, unemployment benefits can implement the efficient outcome.\n15\nProposition 4.3 There exist unemployment benefits b\u2217 > 0, such that an equilibrium with\nthese unemployment benefits is constrained efficient.\nProof. See the appendix.\nThe following figures provide numerical evidence that the logic behind the above results\nholds in the general environment with a larger number of different productivity levels. In\nboth figures there are five equidistant productivity levels (x1 = 3, x2 = 2.5, ..., x5 = 1) with\ns firms at each level (mj = s for all j). In each case the number of worker is equal to the\nnumber of firms (n = 5s). The vertical axis denotes the percentage change in welfare due to\na policy change as a proportion of the original inefficiency.\n1\n3\n5\n7\n9\n1 1.01 1.05 1.1\nminimum wage relative to lowest market wage\nw\ne l\nf a\nr e\n l o\ns s\n r e\nl a\nt i v\ne  \nt o\n u\nn c\no n\ns t\nr a\ni n\ne d\n e\nq u\ni l i\nb r\ni u\nm\ns=1\ns=2\ns=4\ns=8\nFigure 1: Illustration of the efficiency loss relative to the unconstrained equilibrium when a\nminimum wage is introduced.\nIn figure 1, the policy in question is the minimum wage which is denoted as a ratio over the\nlowest unconstrained equilibrium wage on the horizontal axis. Consistent with our previous\nresults, it is clear that the efficiency loss increases when the minimum wage is introduced.\nDifferent specifications of productivity and s yield qualitatively similar graphs which leads\nus to believe that this is a more general result.\nIn figure 2, the level of the unemployment benefit is on the horizontal axis. The produc-\ntivity levels and number of agents are the same as above. This figure shows two things: first,\nmoderate unemployment benefits improve welfare; second, the optimal level of unemployment\nbenefits decreases in the market size (s) which reflects the fact that the decentralized alloca-\ntion approaches efficiency as the market becomes larger. Note that it is not always possible\nto fully achieve efficiency due to the interaction between various productivity levels that can-\nnot be completely fine-tuned with a single policy instrument. However when unemployment\n16\n02\n4\n6\n8\n10\n0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3 0.35\nunemployment benefit\ne f\nf i c\ni e\nn c\ny  \nl o\ns s\n r e\nl a\nt i v\ne  \nt o\n e\nq u\ni l i\nb r\ni u\nm\n w\ni t h\no u\nt  \nu n\ne m\np l\no y\nm\ne n\nt\ns=1\ns=2\ns=4\ns=8\nFigure 2: Illustration of the efficiency loss (efficiency gain if the numbers are smaller than 1)\nfrom the introduction of unemployment benefits.\nbenefits are chosen optimally the efficiency losses in our example are substantially reduced\neven under multiple productivity levels. Again, the features we present are representative of\nthe numerical examples with different number of firms and productivity levels.\n5 Conclusions\nWe develop a frictional model of the labor market with two main features: firms enjoy\nmarket power which leads to inefficiencies in the decentralized allocation; and wages play an\nimportant role in allocating labor. The nature of the inefficiency is that low-productivity\nfirms hire too often and unemployment is too low from a welfare point of view. We show\nthat unemployment benefits can increase welfare because they increase workers\u2019 willingness\nto risk unemployment and look for better employment options, thus, in effect, limiting firms\u2019\nmarket power. In contrast, a minimum wage forces the low-productivity firms to increase\ntheir wages thereby exacerbating the inefficiencies. The employment results put the recent\ndebate on minimum wages into perspective (e.g. Card and Krueger (1994)): while most\npapers have focused on the employment effects of a minimum wage, we show that the welfare\nimplications of such policy can be more complicated. Even when it is desirable to transfer\nsurplus towards workers (in our case because of the firms\u2019 market power), a minimum wage\nmay have additional undesirable distortionary effects.\nWe highlight a particular channel through which inefficiencies may arise, namely the mar-\nket power that firms enjoy in the context of a small market. Since many labor markets are\nfragmented across occupational and geographical lines, we think that this is a case worth\nstudying. For instance, following Shimer (2007) and restricting a labor market to an occupa-\n17\ntion and geographical area combination leads to as few as 10 unemployed workers per labor\nmarket on average with a correspondingly small number of hiring firms.15 While workers\narguably search across some geographical borders and across some occupational boundaries,\nthis calculation suggests that a strategic view of the hiring process might be relevant for the\nlabor market experience of a significant proportion of workers.\nThe positive implications of the two policies that we consider do not depend on the\nfinite nature of the market. We conjecture that models where there is some surplus to the\nemployment relationship (e.g. due to frictions) and where wages play some role in allocating\nlabor share our model\u2019s positive predictions: a (moderate) binding minimum wage constraints\nthe low productivity firms, forcing them to offer better wages and hence leads to a reallocation\nof labor towards such firms. Unemployment benefits, on the other hand, may reallocate\nworkers toward high-productivity firms, depending on the particulars of the model. The\nwelfare effects of these policies depend on whether the original equilibrium is efficient or not.\nIn the case of a large market with risk neutral agents (e.g. Shi (2001) or Shimer (2005)),\nconstrained efficiency obtains in the decentralized equilibrium and policy can only reduce\nwelfare. If one thinks that workers\u2019 risk aversion plays a significant role (as in Acemog\u02d8lu\nand Shimer (1999)) then we conjecture that our main normative insights carry over: in\nan extension of that model with heterogeneous firms, low productivity firms hire too often\nfrom an efficiency viewpoint, a minimum wage worsens the inefficiency and unemployment\nbenefits can help. Of course, it may turn out that firm entry, from which we have abstracted,\nis important in the this context.\n15Shimer (2007) proposes the combination of occupation and geographical unit as a labor market. With\na total of 362 metropolitan and 560 micropolitan statistical areas (regions with at least one urbanized area\nof more than 50,000 inhabitants and 10,000 to 50,000 urban inhabitants, respectively) and about 800 oc-\ncupations listed in the Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) and he obtains a total of about 740,000\ncombinations of occupations and geographic areas. For an unemployment level of 7.6 million in the Cur-\nrent Employment Statistics (CES) of December 2007 this yields on average 10.4 unemployed people per\ncombination of occupation and geographical area.\n18\n6 Appendix\nProposition 4.1:\nProof. For simplicity, assume that no two firms have the same productivity level, though the\ncomplimentary case can be handled with minor modifications. Note that the characterization\nresult from Galenianos and Kircher (2009b) implies that p1 > p2 > ... > pm > 0.\nWe proceed to compare the probabilities implied by the solution to the planner\u2019s problem\nto the ones from the decentralized firms\u2019 problem. First, note that pPj = 0 is a possibility\nfor some j \u2208 M . In that case, it is straightforward to show that there exists some t such\nthat pP1 > p\nP\n2 > ..., p\nP\nt > 0 and p\nP\nt+1 = ... = p\nP\nm = 0, which means that the low productivity\nfirms (below the tth) hire too often in the decentralized allocation, as the statement of the\nproposition suggests.\nIn what follows, we restrict attention to those firms that is efficient to attract applications\nin the constrained efficient allocation. The efficient probabilities are given by equation (21)\nwhich we compare to the probabilities from the decentralized allocation (19). We want to\nshow that for all j < k\n1\u2212 pPk\n1\u2212 pPj\n>\n1\u2212 pk\n1\u2212 pj , (22)\nwhich implies the claim of the proposition. We establish equation (22) for j = 1 and k = 2\nbut the proof is identical for other values of j and k.\nRecalling that U(w) = G(pi(w)) wi, for all pi > 0, the problem of firm 1 is\nmax\nw1\nH(p1(w)) (x1 \u2212 w1)\ns.t. G(p1(w)) w1 = G(p2(w)) w2\nwhich is equivalent to: maxw1 [(1\u2212 (1\u2212 p1)n) x1\u2212n p1 G(p2) w2] where the argument w has\nbeen omitted for brevity. Setting the first order condition of this problem to zero yields\n(1\u2212 p1)n\u22121x1 \u2202p1\n\u2202w1\n= w2[g(p2)\n\u2202p2\n\u2202w1\np1 +G(p2)\n\u2202p1\n\u2202w1\n].\nPerforming the same calculation for firm 2 and combining the results yields\nw1\nw2\n= (\n1\u2212 p2\n1\u2212 p1 )\nn\u22121x2\nx1\n\u2202p2\n\u2202w2\n[g(p2)\n\u2202p2\n\u2202w1\np1 +G(p2)\n\u2202p1\n\u2202w1\n]\n\u2202p1\n\u2202w1\n[g(p1)\n\u2202p1\n\u2202w2\np2 +G(p1)\n\u2202p2\n\u2202w2\n]\n.\n19\nUsing the indifference condition of the buyers, G(p1) w1 = G(p2) w2, leads to\nx1\nx2\n= (\n1\u2212 p2\n1\u2212 p1 )\nn\u22121G(p1)\nG(p2)\n\u2202p2\n\u2202w2\n[g(p2)\n\u2202p2\n\u2202w1\np1 +G(p2)\n\u2202p1\n\u2202w1\n]\n\u2202p1\n\u2202w1\n[g(p1)\n\u2202p1\n\u2202w2\np2 +G(p1)\n\u2202p2\n\u2202w2\n]\n.\nIf\nG(p1)\nG(p2)\n\u2202p2\n\u2202w2\n[g(p2)\n\u2202p2\n\u2202w1\np1 +G(p2)\n\u2202p1\n\u2202w1\n]\n\u2202p1\n\u2202w1\n[g(p1)\n\u2202p1\n\u2202w2\np2 +G(p1)\n\u2202p2\n\u2202w2\n]\n> 1 (23)\nthen equation (22) holds and we have our result.

Let p\u2217i be the equilibrium application probability of workers to firm i when no\nminimum wage is introduced, and let pi(w) be the application probability when the minimum\nwage is introduced. Let (w1(w), w2(w)) refer to an equilibrium wage offer profile if a minimum\nwage requirement is introduced.\nFirst, it is easy to show that\nw1(w) \u2265 w2(w).\nMoreover, w1(w) = w2(w) implies that w1(w) = w2(w) = w, i.e. the minimum wage is so high\nthat it is binding even for the high productivity firm. In this case obviously p1(w) = p2(w)\nholds and thus the equilibrium application levels are further from the constrained efficient\nallocation than without a minimum wage, since without the minimum wage at least p1 > p2\ncould be ensured.\n21\nConsider now the case where w1 > w2 \u2265 w. In this case a high productivity firm chooses\nhis wage offer such that his marginal profit is zero, since such a firm does not face a binding\nminimum wage. Let w1(p1, w2, w\u03021) denote the (unique) wage level that a high productivity\nfirm needs to offer to obtain an application probability of p1, if low productivity firms offer a\nwage of w2 and the other high productivity firms offer a wage of w\u03021. It is easy to show that\nw1(p1, \u03b1w2, \u03b1w\u03021) = \u03b1w1(p1, w2, w\u03021).\nNow, we show that if w2 increases, then the high productivity firms obtain lower application\nprobabilities in equilibrium, which would prove the result, since this means that increasing\nthe minimum wage (and thus w2) moves the allocation even further from the constrained\nefficient allocation. To prove this claim take any given p1 and let w\u03021 be such that if all high\nproductivity firms offer this wage, then each of them is visited with probability p1. Let us\ndenote this value as w\u22171(p1, w2) and note that\nw1(p1, w2, w\n\u2217\n1(p1, w2)) = w\n\u2217\n1(p1, w2).\nSuppose that a high productivity firm, firm i considers a deviation in his wage to change the\napplication probability he receives. If he achieves an application probability of p\u02dc1, then his\nprofit can be written as\n\u03a01(p\u02dc1, w2, p1) = (x1 \u2212 w1(p\u02dc1, w2, w\u22171(p1, w2)))H1(p\u02dc1).\nLinearity of w\u22171 in w2 implies that\nw\u22171(p1, \u03b1w2) = \u03b1w\n\u2217\n1(p1, w2),\nand thus linearity of function w1 in w2 and w\u03021 implies that\nw1(p\u02dc1, \u03b1w2, w\n\u2217\n1(p1, \u03b1w2))) = \u03b1w1(p\u02dc1, w2, w\n\u2217\n1(p1, w2))).\nNow, let us study the marginal profit of firm i from increasing p\u02dc1 when p\u02dc1 = p1 and the low\nproductivity firms offer w2. This marginal profit can be written as\n\u03b2(w2, p1) =\n\u2202(x1 \u2212 w1(p\u02dc1, w2, w\u22171(p1, w2)))H1(p\u02dc1)\n\u2202p\u02dc1\n|p\u02dc1=p1=\n=\n\u2202(x1 \u2212 w2w1(p\u02dc1, 1, w\u22171(p1, 1)))H1(p\u02dc1)\n\u2202p\u02dc1\n|p\u02dc1=p1 .\n22\nIt is immediate that\n\u2202\u03b2(w2, p1)\n\u2202w2\n< 0\nholds. Therefore, if w2 > w\nU\n2 then \u03b2(w2, p\nU\n1 ) < 0. Moreover, it holds that \u03b2(w2, 0) > 0,\nsince attracting an extra customer when no one is planning to visit is always profitable. By\ncontinuity of function \u03b2 it follows that there exists a value p1 \u2208 (0, pU1 ), such that \u03b2(w2, p1) =\n0. By construction, if all other high productivity firms offer a wage of w\u22171(p1, w2) and low\nproductivity firms offer w2, then any given high productivity firm cannot gain by changing his\nwage offer by deviating from w\u22171(p1, w2) slightly. However, Galenianos and Kircher (2009b)\nshow that under assumption C1 the profit function is concave in the own wage variable and\nthus offering w\u22171(p1, w2) is a best reply for all high productivity firms.\nTherefore, for every wage level of the low productivity firms, such that w2 > w\nU\n2 , there\nis an equilibrium in the game between only the high productivity firms (i.e. taking w2 as\ngiven) such that the workers\u2019 application probability to high productivity firms goes down if\nlow productivity firms all offered wage w2, because p1 < p\nU\n1 .\nThe proof is completed by showing that for every w2 the best response in the game of high\nproductivity firms is unique. The tedious algebra for this result can be obtained from the au-\nthors upon request (or see the technical appendix on http:\/\/galenian.googlepages.com\/research).\nProposition 4.3:\nProof. Let pj(b) denote the probability with which a worker applies to some firm of pro-\nductivity xj when the level of unemployment benefits is given by b. Assume without loss of\ngenerality that x1 > x2. Under (C1) both firms attract applications when b = 0. If p\n\u2217\n2 = 0,\nthen setting b = x2 implements the constrained efficient allocation. The rest of the proof\nconsiders the case where pP2 > 0.\nThe strategy of the proof is to show that there is a b\u2217 such that the firms\u2019 first order\nconditions coincide with the ones of the planner. Constrained efficiency is given by\nx1\nx2\n= (\n1\u2212 pP2\n1\u2212 pP1\n)n\u22121 > (\n1\u2212 p\u22172\n1\u2212 p\u22171\n)n\u22121,\nwhere the inequality follows from the argument used in the proof of Proposition 4.1 (noting\nthat in our notation p\u2217j = pj(0)).\nAs shown in Section 3, an unemployment benefit is mathematically equivalent to lowering\nthe productivity of every firm by b leading to the following equilibrium condition for the\n23\ndecentralized economy:\nx1 \u2212 b\nx2 \u2212 b = (\n1\u2212 p2(b)\n1\u2212 p1(b))\nn\u22121G(p1(b))\nG(p2(b))\n\u2202p2\n\u2202w2\n[g(p2(b))\n\u2202p2\n\u2202w1\np1(b) +G(p2(b))\n\u2202p1\n\u2202w1\n]\n\u2202p1\n\u2202w1\n[g(p1(b))\n\u2202p1\n\u2202w2\np2(b) +G(p1(b))\n\u2202p2\n\u2202w2\n]\nWe use the intermediate value theorem to conclude the proof. Note that for b close enough\nto x2\nx1 \u2212 b\nx2 \u2212 b > (\n1\u2212 p2(b)\n1\u2212 p1(b))\nn\u22121 G(p1(b))\nG(p2(b))\n\u2202p2\n\u2202w2\n[g(p2(b))\n\u2202p2\n\u2202w1\np1(b) +G(p2(b))\n\u2202p1\n\u2202w1\n]\n\u2202p1\n\u2202w1\n[g(p1(b))\n\u2202p1\n\u2202w2\np2(b) +G(p1(b))\n\u2202p2\n\u2202w2\n]\n.\nIf b = 0, then\nx1 \u2212 b\nx2 \u2212 b = (\n1\u2212 p2(b)\n1\u2212 p1(b))\nn\u22121 < (\n1\u2212 p2(b)\n1\u2212 p1(b))\nn\u22121G(p1(b))\nG(p2(b))\n\u2202p2\n\u2202w2\n[g(p2(b))\n\u2202p2\n\u2202w1\np1(b) +G(p2(b))\n\u2202p1\n\u2202w1\n]\n\u2202p1\n\u2202w1\n[g(p1(b))\n\u2202p1\n\u2202w2\np2(b) +G(p1(b))\n\u2202p2\n\u2202w2\n]\n.\nTherefore, an appropriate value of b \u2208 [0, x2) works to replicate the constrained efficient\nallocation.\n24\nReferences\n[1] Acemog\u02d8lu, Daron (2001): \u201cGood Jobs versus Bad Jobs,\u201d Journal of Labor Economics,\n19, pp. 1-22.\n[2] Acemog\u02d8lu, Daron and Robert Shimer (1999): \u201cEfficient Unemployment Insurance,\u201d\nJournal of Political Economy, 107, 893-928.\n[3] Albrecht, James, Pieter A.
