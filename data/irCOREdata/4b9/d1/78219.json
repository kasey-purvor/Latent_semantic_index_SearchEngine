Calixarene-crown-6\nderivatives with terminal carboxyl groups were synthesised and\nattached to nano-sized magnetoferritin molecules and their\nability to sequester radioactive caesium(I) ions from aqueous\nsolution was demonstrated.\nAlthough traditional techniques for removing radioactive\nimpurities produce pure water, they are either not selective\nand\/or they produce large volumes of secondary waste. This is\nespecially the case when impurities are present in very low\nmolar concentrations compared to other harmless species.1\nHence, there is an urgent need for economic and environ-\nmental reasons to develop new separation technologies to\nselectively remove only the radioactive ions while leaving the\n\u2018harmless\u2019 elements in water. The operational parameters\nrequired for the new separation systems are high specificity\nand high complexation capacity for the trace elements. In\naddition, they should be easily separated from the treated\nliquid, and should produce minimal amounts of secondary\nwaste. Recently, we have researched the potential of a new\nseparation technology based on the attachment of ion selective\nchelating molecules to paramagnetic nano-sized particles so\nthat the resultant conjugates can be used to target and extract\ntrace amounts of ions selectively from aqueous waste streams.\nIon selective bifunctional chelating agents can be synthesised\nfor a wide range of nuclides.2,3 The attachment of these\nchelating agents to discrete nano-sized paramagnetic particles\nhas several advantages: nano-sized particles possess high\nsurface area enabling the attachment of a large number of\nchelating agents to their surface, hence the removal of more\ncontaminants per volume of material. They are also very small\ncompared to the micron-sized particles used in traditional\nclean-up methods, therefore they have the potential to signifi-\ncantly reduce the volume of secondary waste. Moreover,\nparamagnetic nanoparticles can be removed easily from aqueous\nsolution by magnetic filtration which is a well proven separa-\ntion technology used in the steel and mineral processing\nindustries.4,5\nMagnetoferritin, a magnetic variety of the naturally occur-\nring iron storage protein ferritin, was chosen and tested\nas a possible paramagnetic nanoparticle because it is easily\ndispersed in aqueous systems, its size is of the right order of\nmagnitude (ca. 12 nm diameter)6,7 and its magnetic suscepti-\nbility is uniform and sufficient to respond to magnetic filtra-\ntion. In addition, magnetoferritin possesses surface functional\ngroups which make it possible to couple other molecules to its\nsurface.\nOur approach was to synthesise and attach a caesium specific\nchelating agent to magnetoferritin because 137Cs is a major\nradiation source in radioactive waste water and is strictly\ncontrolled regarding its release to the environment.8 We chose\ncalixarene derivatives as putative chelating agents because their\nexceptional affinity for caesium is well documented.9\u201311 More-\nover, their cavity size and hence selectivity can be modified\nwhich could be useful in future applications: if the synthesis,\nattachment and caesium separation of the chosen derivative\nare successful it opens up the possibility to build a family of\nchelating agents based on calixarenes to target other problematic\nions in waste water treatment.\nWhile magnetoferritin is relatively easy to produce (Nano-\nmagnetics, University Gate East, Park Row, Bristol, UK BS1\n5UB, following the procedure by Wong et al.12), there have\nbeen only a few reports on its applications.13\u201316 Similarly,\nliterature on the attachment of calixarene derivatives to macro-\nmolecules is also very scarce.17\u201319 Although 1,3-calix[4]arene-\nbiscrown-6 derivatives have excellent affinity towards caesium,\nthey have no available functional groups through which the\nattachment to magnetoferritin could be achieved. However,\npreviously it has been shown that when one of the crowns has\nbeen replaced by two hydrocarbon chains there are insignifi-\ncant changes in selectivity.20\u201322 According to Arnaud-Neu\net al. for example, the Cs\/Na selectivity of dioctyl calix[4]-\narene-crown-6 was excellent, in the region of 33 000.23 Therefore\nit was decided to synthesize 25,27-bis[(3-carboxypropyl)oxy]-\ncalix[4]arene-crown-6 having two hydrocarbon chains with\nterminal carboxyl groups as shown in Scheme 1. Purification\nby flash chromatography was undertaken at each step, the\noverall yield to the final product was about 20%. High\nresolution MS, 1H NMR, 13C NMR and IR spectra are\nconsistent with the product structure and intermediates.\nBefore attachment of the calixarene to magnetoferritin\nits capability to sequester caesium(I) ions from solutions was\nassessed. 25,27-Bis[(3-carboxypropyl)oxy]calix[4]arene-crown-6\n(2.4 mg, 2.87 \u0002 10\u00033 mmol) was dissolved in deuterated\nchloroform (2 ml) while solid caesium picrate (17.8 mg, 4.93 \u0002\n10\u00032 mmol) was dissolved in deuterated water (20 ml). Solvent\nextraction was performed by mixing the calixarene solution\n(0.8 ml, 1.15 \u0002 10\u00033 mmol) with the caesium picrate (0.8 ml,\n0.2 \u0002 10\u00033 mmol) solution for three minutes. 1H NMR\nspectroscopy was used as a rapid initial methodology for\na Centre for Research in Analytical, Materials and Sensor Sciences,\nDept. of Applied Sciences, University of the West of England,\nFrenchay Campus, Coldharbour Lane, Bristol, UK BS16 1QY.\nE-mail: norman.ratcliffe@uwe.ac.uk; Tel: +44 117 3282501\nb Bradtec Decon Technologies, The Wheelhouse, Bonds Mill Estate,\nStonehouse, Gloucestershire, UK GL10 3RF\nw Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: Experimental\ndetails.

The chemical shifts of the aromatic\n(between 6.8 and 7.3 d) and the polyether protons (between 3.3\nand 4 d) were shifted downfield indicating that the caesium(I)\nion has been complexed in the crown structure and that it has\nalso strongly interacted with the aromatic rings. Furthermore,\ninspection of the spectrum showed there were no unshifted\npeaks, therefore complete complexation by all the calixarene\nmolecules can be inferred.\nSolvent extraction was also performed between aqueous\nsolutions of caesium picrate containing radioactive caesium\nchloride and ethyl acetate with the synthesised calixarene.\nThree solutions were prepared: 25,27-bis[(3-carboxypropyl)-\noxy]calix[4]arene-crown-6 (83 mg, 9.99 \u0002 10\u00032 mmol) in\ndistilled ethyl acetate (80 ml), caesium picrate (18 mg, 4.99 \u0002\n10\u00032 mmol) in deionised water (20 ml) and a secondary\nradioactive stock solution of caesium chloride (25 ml, 370 Bq\/ml)\nfurther diluted with deionised water to a total volume of\n100 ml. Calixarene in ethyl acetate (25 ml, 3.12 \u0002 10\u00032 mmol)\nwas then shaken with a mixture of the diluted radioactive\ncaesium chloride (92.5 Bq\/ml) and caesium picrate (2.49 \u0002\n10\u00032 mmol) solution (50 ml) for 1 h. As a control experiment,\nethyl acetate without the calixarene was also shaken with the\ncaesium mixture. The resultant emulsions were left to separate\novernight. The caesium activity in the organic (1 ml) and\nthe aqueous phases (1 ml) was determined using a LKB-Wallac\n1282 CompuGammamicrocomputer controlled universal gamma\ncounter.\nThe activity in the organic phase containing the chelating\nagent increased significantly after solvent extraction with a\nconcomitant decrease in the aqueous phase indicating that about\n42% of the radioactive caesium was extracted. Meanwhile\ncontrol experiments showed that insignificant caesium extraction\n(only 1%) occurred in the absence of calixarene (Table 1).\nTo enable the use of the synthesized compound in the\nproposed new magnetic separation technology it has to be\nattached to magnetoferritin in such a way that its ability to\nseparate caesium(I) ions is retained. Amine groups of macro-\nmolecules are the most often targeted functional groups for the\nattachment of specific chelating agents through the formation\nof amide bonds by activated carboxylic acids.24,25 Many\nactivation methods were assessed to maximize the number of\ncalixarene molecules bound to the surface of magnetoferritin\nin a consistent and reproducible manner. This task proved\nto be very difficult since the calixarene derivative was only\nsoluble in organic solvents in which the magnetoferritin\nbecame very unstable. However, formation of acyl halides\nwas found to be the most effective for the attachment of 25,27-\nbis[(3-carboxypropyl)oxy]calix[4]arene-crown-6 to magneto-\nferritin (Scheme 2). Acyl fluoride was particularly useful, due\nmost likely to its much lower rate of hydrolysis compared to\nother acyl halides. High resolution MS, 1H NMR, 13C NMR\nand IR spectra were consistent with the acyl fluoride, which\nwas used for the attachment to magnetoferritin without\nfurther purification. Buffered (HEPES, 0.05 mol dm\u00033,\npH 8.6) magnetoferritin solution (5.5 ml containing 11 mg,\n1.2 \u0002 10\u00035 mmol magnetoferritin) was added to sodium\nbicarbonate solution (14.5 ml, 0.1 mol dm\u00033) while 25,27-\nbis[(3-carboxypropyl)oxy]calix[4]arene-crown-6 fluoride (34.1 mg,\n4.1 \u0002 10\u00035 mol) was dissolved in DMSO (1 ml). The dissolved\nfluoride (0.5 ml, 2.05\u0002 10\u00035 mol) was mixed with the prepared\nmagnetoferritin solution (20 ml, 1.2 \u0002 10\u00035 mmol magneto-\nferritin) and left at room temperature overnight. A control\nsolution was also prepared by mixing the magnetoferritin\nsolution (20 ml, 1.2 \u0002 10\u00035 mmol magnetoferritin) with\nDMSO (0.5 ml). The following day the sample and control\nsolutions were cleaned by dialysis and used to sequester\nradioactive caesium from solution.\nRadioactive caesium (2 ml, 370 Bq\/ml) was added to three\nsolutions (1 ml each): one containing the functionalized\nmagnetoferritin, another the magnetoferritin without chelating\nagent and the third deionized water. The solutions were left to\nequilibrate for about 1 h and loaded into a separation column\nwith the magnetic field on (Fig. 1). The column was washed\nwith water and the effluent was collected in fractions (3\u0002 10 ml).\nAfter the third fraction the magnetic field was switched off and\nthree further fractions were collected. The radioactivity in each\nfraction was measured and the activities were calculated. Table 2\nlists these values.\nThe activity of the deionised water was only tested to obtain\ninformation on the time needed for the radioactive caesium\nto leave the column. Results showed that 90% of the radio-\nactivity left the system with the magnetic field still on. A similar\ntrend was observed when the control magnetoferritin was\nScheme 1 Synthetic route for preparing 25,27-bis[(3-carboxypropyl)-\noxy]calix[4]arene-crown-6.\nTable 1 Data to show the ability of 25,27-bis[(3-carboxypropyl)oxy]-\ncalix[4]arene-crown-6 to complex radioactive caesium\nActivity before\nsolvent extraction\n(Bq ml\u00031)\nActivity after\nsolvent extraction\n(Bq ml\u00031)\nSample Control Sample Control\nOrganic phase 0 0 80.7 2\nAqueous phase 92.3 95.8 55.7 92\nScheme 2 Formation of acyl fluoride and its attachment to ferritin.\n4584 | Chem.

Although the effluents collected with the magnetic field\non were colorless, indicating the absence of magnetoferritin, the\ngamma emission of the third fraction increased significantly and\n80% of radioactivity left the system with the magnetic field still\non. This suggested that only a fraction of the radioactive\ncaesium may have been associated with the control magneto-\nferritin. When the functionalized magnetoferritin was tested the\neffluents collected with the magnetic field on were also colour-\nless and only a small increase of gamma emission was detected\nin the third fraction. However, a few seconds after the magnetic\nfield was switched off a dark brown solution appeared and the\ngamma emission increased significantly. These results showed\nthat 90% of radioactivity was associated with the magnetic\nmolecule, indicating that the calixarene had been attached\nto the magnetoferritin successfully without losing its ability to\nseparate caesium(I) ions from solutions.\nIn conclusion, with this pilot study it has been shown that\nmagnetoferritin can be functionalised with a calix[4]arene-\ncrown-6 derivative and subsequently used for caesium chelation.\nThe functionalised paramagnetic particles with the radioactive\ncaesium can be easily removed from solution by magnetic\nfiltration and can be further concentrated by evaporation.\nThese nanoparticles are up to five orders of magnitude smaller\nthan the existing ion exchange beads and they are ion specific\ndue to their functionalisation. Using these particles can reduce\nthe volume of secondary waste significantly, which is desirable\nfor both economic and environmental reasons.\nFurther work to scale-up syntheses and to produce small\nscale separation equipment is under way.\nWe acknowledge the financial support of Bradtec and EPRI\nfor funding a PhD studentship for Ilona Urban.\nNotes and references\n1 R.
