Mercury is used in different \nways and at different stages of the mining and gold extraction process, and this varies \nfrom country to country and region to region. There have been many projects launched \nthat have attempted to reduce both the overall use of mercury and particularly its release \ninto the environment. It is well established that using retorts can virtually eliminate  \nthe release of mercury from the final stages of gold ore processing but projects to \nintroduce them as a best practice in ASM areas have met limited success. \nThis paper reports findings from a project which sought to: \n1 establish the practices and attitudes of miners towards mercury use \n2 investigate the possibilities of identifying a processing method that can actually  \nbe a substitute for the use of mercury in the ASM sector in Ghana \n3 test the identified process, first in the laboratory and then in the field in a local \nmining area \n4 if successful, disseminate the information to the wider ASM community in Ghana. \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n    The identification and testing of a method 291    \n \n    \n \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n       \n \nDuring the first phase of this project, the ASM sector in Ghana was assessed,  \ndrawing upon past reports and the extensive knowledge of the project team, \nsupplemented by a Characterisation Survey carried out in the main mining areas.  \nThis established a clear picture of the mining and processing methods and the way \nmercury is used in Ghana. A review of existing literature and personal experience of the \nauthors were used to identify the process or processes that have the most potential as a \nsubstitute for mercury and a programme of laboratory and field testing was proposed. \nThis paper is a pr\u00e9cis of a comprehensive report of the first phase of the project  \n(Styles et al., 2006a). The laboratory testing phase of the project is the subject of a  \nsecond report (Styles et al., 2006b) and is summarised in the accompanying paper by \nAmankwah et al. (2009). The study was made possible through the EU Mining Sector \nSupport Programme in Ghana. \n2 The use of mercury by artisanal gold miners and technology transfer \nPrevious studies, particularly in South America, have shown that mercury can be used  \nat various stages of the mining and gold recovery process. This includes mining,  \nwhere mercury is thrown in to the pit to collect fine gold; milling, where it is put in the \nball mills; and sluicing, where it is put in the sluice box to collect small particles  \ntogether to make them easier to capture. These processes are all highly damaging to the \nenvironment as mercury is easily lost, but worse still, demonstrably inefficient  \npractices, as far greater benefit can be gained by using good standard practice.  \nLuckily, these practices appear to be rare in Ghana. Disc mills rather than ball mills  \nare used for fine milling. This is not amenable to mercury use; moreover, mercury use in \nsluices appears to be rare. \nThe main stage where mercury is used is the recovery of small gold grains from  \nthe black sand concentrates collected on sluices. This process is widespread and very \neffective, and most miners know of no alternative method. The procedure consists of \nadding mercury to the black sand in the pan and rolling and rubbing it through the  \nsand so that it gets in contact with the gold grains and sticks them together to form a gold \nmercury amalgam paste. The black sand with the gold removed can subsequently  \nbe washed away, leaving only the amalgam. The amalgam can then be heated over a fire \nor with a blowtorch to drive off the mercury as vapour, leaving behind yellowish-brown \nsponge gold. This is a serious immediate hazard to the operators and a long-term hazard \nto the local area. This heating process would ideally be carried out in a retort with the \nmercury vapour condensed, captured and reused.  \nSeveral projects have previously been carried out in Ghana connected with the \nreduction in the use of mercury, the most significant of which was the UNIDO mercury \nproject (Babut et al., 2003). Although retorts had been made available under the project \nand were present at several processing sites, there was no evidence that they were being \nused by artisanal miners. The retorts are too difficult, slow and cumbersome to use, \ntaking perhaps 2 h to process a ball of amalgam compared to 5 min with a fire or  \ntorch (Hilson and Pardie, 2006; Hilson et al., 2007; Tschakert and Singha, 2007). There is \nconsiderable difficulty making and maintaining a heat source that is sufficiently hot for \nthe retort to work efficiently. The miners refuse to wait that long to get the end result of \ntheir labours. \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   292 M.T. Styles et al.    \n \n    \n \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n       \n \nIt is important to understand why the impact of these projects has been so limited:  \nIs it that the technology was inappropriate or that the methods employed to introduce  \nthe technology were ineffective? The outcome of various projects were analysed and  \nthe response of miners were studied. It may be clear to an outsider that inefficient or \nhazardous methods are being used but if that is what they all do, it could be seen as \n\u2018normal\u2019. For any new method to be accepted it must be simple and cheap, using locally \navailable materials not expensive imported equipment and must show direct financial \nbenefits in the short term (Hinton et al., 2003). Long-term health benefits from a process \nsuch as retorting have previously been clearly explained and demonstrated. \nThe glass retort introduced is fragile and not good for use in the rugged small-scale \ngold mining environment and the bad heat conduction of glass slows production.  \nThe technology that is effective in an ideal environment is not appropriate in the ASM \nsetting. Past projects have shown that it is a non-starter. It is clearly vital that  \nthe technology must not just be effective but also appropriate. Once an appropriate \ntechnique is identified and tested, demonstrations are a necessary and effective method  \nof communicating the new technology, particularly if the larger, more important sites in \nan area are used and the successful, influential miners are \u2018buying in\u2019 to the process. \nMiners tend to copy their neighbours if they think they have something better. \nDemonstrations must be a part of any programme. \n3 Characterisation survey \nA clear picture of the ASM practices and the attitudes of operators is an important \nstarting point for the selection of a possible method to replace the use of mercury.  \nTo achieve this, a national Characterisation Survey was carried out. The Survey covered \na wide range of factual information, including the geology of the mining area and the \ntypes of deposit being worked, the size and organisation of the mining site, the mining \nand processing techniques used and the legal status of the operation. It was necessary  \nto know the nature of the gold-bearing ore, particularly the grain size of the gold, as this \ndetermines the possibilities and options for gold recovery. This information was needed \nto understand why and what the miners do and the technical problems and difficulties \nminers face. In addition, it was necessary to know if the miners used mercury and at  \nwhat stages of the mining or processing it was used. If they used mercury, were they \naware of the hazards and did they know of any alternative? Finally, it was essential  \nto know what the miners\u2019 attitude was to using an alternative to mercury and what were \nthe vital features of any alternative method to make it successful, and particularly,  \nthe economic factors including the process of selling gold to dealers. The Survey was \nbased on a questionnaire implemented by graduate students from University of Mines and \nTechnology (UMaT), Ghana, and supplemented by observations made by the members of \nthe research team. \n3.1 Mining methods \nGhana\u2019s artisanal and small-scale miners process two major categories of gold ores: \nalluvial\/eluvial and hard rocks. The hard rock, which may be lode or reefs, could be free \nmilling or refractory ores. Subsequent studies of the data showed that the type of ore and \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n    The identification and testing of a method 293    \n \n    \n \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n       \n \nmining method have a major influence on all subsequent processes and hence will be \ndescribed separately. \n3.1.1 Alluvial mining \nAlluvial mining generally involves digging pits ranging from less that 2 m in depth in the \ngravel beds of small and slow moving streams, or in eddying pools on the shallow banks \nof larger rivers to large pits possibly 10\u201320 m deep and 100 or more metres across.  \nThe smaller pits are operated by artisans or galamsey. \nAnother mining technique for alluvial\/eluvial deposits used by galamsey involves the \ndigging small circular pits or shafts by individuals. Larger excavations may go down to \n20 m deep and over until the gravel horizon is located. The ore excavated from these pits \nis usually carried in head pans to suitable locations for processing either by sluicing or \npanning. In some places, work is organised in \u2018family\u2019 groups with the men digging  \nthe ore and the women doing the sluicing and panning, while in others women only carry \nthe ore from the pits to the processing site. These sites are often unlicensed and poorly \norganised with little regard for health and safety and environmental consequences. \n3.1.2 Hard rock mining \nPrimary hard rock underground operations feature narrow, vertical\/inclined shafts or  \nadits for access to the ore body. Shafts range in size (1\u20132 m in diameter if circular or \n1 m \u00d7 1\u20132 m for square and rectangular shafts) and depth (10\u201350 m), and occur in a \nvariety of shapes, ranging from chimney type, to long \u2018snakelike\u2019 tubes that bend to \nfollow the line of the reef. \nThey deploy a variety of tools (shovels, picks, hammers, axes, chisels, metal bars, \nmattocks, etc.) to loosen and excavate the ore, especially when in the form of weathered \nquartz veins. The ore is shovelled into sacks and buckets and transported to the shaft.  \nIn some cases where miners encounter very hard rock, explosives are used, though this  \nis illegal (Aryee et al., 2003). \nIn general, there is little regard for proper health and safety procedures, and \nunderground mining in particular is a dangerous and hazardous activity. Ventilation is \noften a problem in the deeper mines, particularly after blasting, and various kinds of \npumps are used in some places. Since miners face daily and immediate danger of rock \nfalls that kill or maim instantly, mercury that poses long term hazard from a slow \ncumulative poison may seem a comparatively small risk.  \n3.2 Ore processing  \nAfter mining, the ore is processed to liberate and separate gold grains. For alluvial ores, \nliberation is accomplished by scrubbing and washing, while comminution is used for  \nhard rock. Primary separation is generally conducted in sluice boards and the sluice \nconcentrate is cleaned in pans before amalgamation. Small-scale miners extract only \ngravity recoverable gold and overall recoveries are estimated to be between 30% and \n40%. The finer gold particles in the tailings that require dissolution for recovery may be \nprocessed profitably by larger companies. \n \n \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   294 M.T. Styles et al.    \n \n    \n \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n       \n \nIn many ASM regions, the processing sites are separate from the mining areas and \ncloser to sources of water and power. Some sites act as independent central processing \ncentres that provide a service and treat ore from many sites in their vicinity. The ore is \neither transported using rented\/hired trucks or hand carts, and if within a reasonable \ndistance, carried in sacks. \n3.2.1 Washing and screening \nThe main pre-concentration processes performed on alluvial material are washing  \nand screening. Washing is carried out mainly on alluvial gold ores to remove pebbles, \nbreak up clay and remove slimes. The extent and mode of washing usually depends on \nhow strongly the clay adheres to the surface of the gold. If the clay content is low and \nadhesion to the mineral surface is weak, washing and screening are done simultaneously, \nusually by shaking a hand held screen (with the material in it) in water. On more \nmechanised sites (e.g., Kodkoff Mining Services Company at the Kobirsu site in the \nAkyem Oda area), the scrubbing is undertaken using specific mechanical scrubbers and \nthe loosened material screened through trommels. Some miners carry this out in rotating \ndrums used locally for mixing concrete. Other miners perform this operation by pounding \nand shearing the material with their feet in basins after pre-soaking with water. In both \ncases, the added water is decanted from time to time and fresh water is introduced.  \nThe process continues until the gravel and sands are relatively clean. \nScreens used in gold processing are usually selected on the basis of gold particle size \nin the area under consideration (with \u2018nuggety\u2019 areas using screens with larger openings). \nHowever, most Ghanaian miners often do not have a choice of screen size and are forced \nto use whatever is available. Most miners use metal woven screens for coarse separation \nand rayon-type material for fine screening. Constant abrasion from the ore usually causes \nan increase in the openings of the rayon material and as a result has to be replaced \nfrequently. \n3.2.2 Comminution \nLiberation from hard rock ores begins with comminution. Currently, size reduction is \nconducted using hammer and disc mills. Though hammer mills are generally used for \nprimary crushing, some are coupled directly to sluice boards. For secondary milling, disc \nmills used locally for grinding corn and other foodstuffs have been modified and \nequipped with harder grinding surfaces for pulverising the hard abrasive ores. In most \nprocessing centres, such units may only work for part of the day unless there is sufficient \nore available for continuous operation. These mills break down and require repairs on a \nvery frequent basis. \nThere are extremely high levels of airborne dust at the centralised processing plants \nas this grinding is invariably dry. In many cases, the comminution is carried out inside \nhuts or buildings with no forced ventilation to remove the dust. In such places,  \nthe workers are exposed to dangerous levels of siliceous dust and high noise levels but \nare rarely provided with suitable Personal Protection Equipment (PPE), dust masks or ear \nplugs. \n \n \n \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n    The identification and testing of a method 295    \n \n    \n \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n       \n \n3.2.3 Concentration \nIn Ghana, there are number of gravity concentration units that are now available to the \nformal ASM sector, including sluices and shaking tables, jigs, gold savers and centrifugal \nconcentrators (such as the Knelson Concentrator that is available from mining equipment \nsuppliers). However, by far, the most common unit in use, especially by the galamsey,  \nis the standard sluice box (or board). These units are relatively cheap, easy to use, and are \nwell suited to the mining environment of Ghana. The sluice boxes are all built locally \nusing hard wood boards or metal sheets (with sides slightly curved inwards) or even split \nbamboo. The board is lined with either a basic blanket, towel, carpet or jute material,  \nbut increasingly \u2018miner\u2019s moss\u2019, astro turf or Nomad\u00ae type matting is used where it is \navailable. \nMost sluices seen during the survey only had one type of lining, that is not applicable \nto all particle sizes. Although most sluices are very crude, some are more sophisticated \nand use riffles and de-sliming units. At most sites, the sluiced tailings are scavenged \nseveral times before they are finally discarded to increase retrieval of gold particles lost \nin previous operations. There is a lot of scope for improving the design of the sluice \nboxes used. \nAfter the first separation operation such as sluicing, concentrates consisting of black \nsands with a small percentage of gold are produced. These are generally cleaned by hand \npanning in wooden or rubber pans (cut from rubber sheets). This panning produces a \ngold-rich concentrate but this still contains a lot of black sand, perhaps 75%. Separating \nthe gold from this concentrate is easy if the gold is coarse but a major problem when it is \nvery fine grained. In most places, miners use mercury amalgamation to separate the gold \nfrom the black sands. \n3.3 Testing of gold ores \nThere was virtually no information available about the grain size of gold ores from the \nASM mining regions in Ghana. It is, however, vital to know this to be able to select a \nsuitable method for gold recovery; a small programme of gold grain size measurement, \ntherefore, was carried out. \nSamples of gold concentrate were collected from mine sites throughout Ghana to \nestablish a baseline of gold grain size data. Eighteen samples were analysed using the \nmethod of sieving and grain size counting (Styles et al., 2002). The measurements \nshowed, as might be expected, that there were clear differences between alluvial and  \nhard rock ores. \nThe sample from the Bonte area, where there is small-scale and artisanal mining,  \nis a good example alluvial ore. As Figure 1 shows, 80% of the gold is in the form of \nparticles coarser than 0.25 mm and 40% greater than 1 mm. This means that most  \nof the gold is easily separated from black sand by careful panning or simple methods \nsuch as \u2018blow and tap\u2019. In contrast, the hardrock ores show a significant difference;  \nthe gold from the processing plant in Tarkwa (Figure 2) had a predominance of smaller \ngrains, 30% of which was coarser than 0.25 mm (easily recoverable) but 50% less than \n0.125 mm and thus difficult to recover. The gold from a processing plant at Bolgatanga \n(Figure 3) shows an even more extreme size distribution, with less than 10% coarser than \n0.25 mm and more than 80% smaller than 0.125 mm, and very difficult to recover.  \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   296 M.T. Styles et al.    \n \n    \n \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n       \n \nIt is easy to see why the miners resort to mercury to recover gold in these hard rock \nmining areas. \nFigure 1 Grain size distribution of gold from alluvial gravel in the Bonte area \n \nFigure 2 Grain size distribution of gold from hard rock ore from the Tarkwa area \n \nFigure 3 Grain size distribution of gold from hard rock ore from the Bolgatanga area \n \nThe testing of gold ores established the most important parameter: that any alternative \nmethod must be very effective for gold less than 100 microns in size. \n3.4 Attitudes to change \nThe Characterisation Survey investigated miners\u2019 knowledge and attitudes towards \nmercury and the desire or willingness to adopt alternatives. In most places,  \npeople generally seemed to know that mercury was not particularly good for them,  \nbut knew very little about the specific problems and probably do not really understand \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n    The identification and testing of a method 297    \n \n    \n \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n       \n \nhow a cumulative poison acts. Few, if any, knew of anyone who had been seriously \naffected by mercury poisoning, and this probably accounts for their general lack of \nconcern about its widespread use. Most said they would be happy to use an alternative if \nit was as effective as mercury amalgamation. \nVarious other social factors were examined as part of the Survey but these do not \nappear to have a major influence on the use of mercury or the willingness to change. \nHealth concerns are a very low priority for the groups studied. Speed, cost and efficiency \nare the overriding factors. Any process that cannot match amalgamation on these criteria \nhas little chance of acceptance.  \n4 Alternative methods \nIn Ghana, mercury is principally used for the separation of small gold grains from heavy \nmineral concentrates. From the results of the survey it is clear that mercury is widely used \nbecause it is: \n\u2022 Effective \n\u2022 Easy to carry out (requires no special equipment) \n\u2022 Quick \n\u2022 Inexpensive \n\u2022 Suitable for processing small batches of concentrate \n\u2022 Visible (the miners can see their products throughout the whole process). \nA desk study was carried out to assess various processing methods that are currently \navailable for the separation of gold. The guidelines outlined above were important but the \nvital criterion was that it must be very effective for gold grains smaller than 100 microns. \nTable 1 shows the various methods and their applicability in small-scale mining. \nTable 1 Matrix showing processing methods and their application in small-scale operations \nMethod \nEquipment\/ \nprocess Principle Comments \nSluice Gravity \nconcentration \nleading to \nproduction of a \nrough concentrate \nthat has to be \ncleaned further \nUsed in virtually all small-scale mining \ncentres as a conventional rougher \nconcentration unit \nPhysical \nCleangold \nsluice \nGravity \nconcentration \nleading to \nproduction of a \nclean concentrate \nTrials showed that it did not work well \nfor the hard rock ores as the high \nmagnetite content clogged the sluice very \nquickly and a good separation could not \nbe achieved.

Gold lixiviation using cyanide is \nnot allowed in Ghana, mainly due to the \nacute toxicity of sodium cyanide and the \nrelatively low environmental consciousness \nof the average miner. The method is not fast \nenough for processing concentrates as it takes \na long time.

First a sample of ore is \ntested and the ore purchased, the small \nindividual batches are mixed together to \nproduce a load suitable for processing  \nand the miners are paid by the company  \nafter processing. We suggest that this is not \napplicable to the artisanal environment as it is \n1 too costly and too complex for \nindividuals or small groups  \n2 uses a proprietary chemical, thus locking \nthe miners into a foreign third party \nsupplier \n3 has major issues of trust and keeping \ntrack of an individual\u2019s ore \nChemical \nSmelting Melting black \nsand \nconcentrates to \nproduce pure \ngold \nSmelting is applied in most small scale \ncentres and miners are familiar with the \nmethod as it is currently applied for purifying \nsponge gold. It has, however, not been \napplied in processing of concentrates and \nneeds development and testing. \nFrom Table 1, it can be seen that sophisticated physical methods are too expensive  \nand hence a chemical method is required. Smelting is the only chemical process that is \nnot based on dissolution. More importantly, it is the only process that produces pure gold \nin a single step, as the gold along with some black sand, obtained after winnowing, \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   300 M.T.

It has \ntheoretical potential. \n4.1 Overview from the desk study and characterisation survey \nThe Characterisation Survey has determined that most mercury is utilised after secondary \ngravity concentration. Mercury amalgamation is both cheap and effective, and miners \nhave little incentive to seek an alternative. An important baseline is actually testing the \nefficiency of amalgamation, as it is widely believed by miners to be highly effective;  \nbut there is little actual testing to support this. The challenge was to identify and test an \nalternative that can separate fine-grained gold from heavy mineral concentrates \neffectively. \nThe various gold processing techniques outlined in Table 1 were compared with \namalgamation. A summary of the advantages and disadvantages of the various processes \nevaluated is shown in a matrix of benefits (Table 2). The methods are rated from 1 to 3, \nwhere 1 is \u2018poor\u2019 and 3 is \u2018good\u2019. \nTable 2 Matrix of benefits of processing methods \nMethod Speed Cost Visibility\nBatch \nprocessing\nSimple \noperation\nToxic \nhazard\nEffective \nfor small \ngold grains\nWell \ndeveloped \ntechnology \nClean end \nproduct \nAmalgamation 3 3 3 3 3 1 3 3 3 \nSluice 3 3 3 3 3 3 2 3 1 \nShaking table 3 2 3 3 2 3 3 3 2 \nCentrifugal 3 1 1 3 2 3 3 3 3 \nCyanidation 1 2 1 3 1 1 3 3 3 \nIgoli 2 1 2 3 1 2 3 2 3 \nHaber 2 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 3 \nCoal \nagglomeration \n2 3 2 3 2 2 3? 1 3 \nDirect \nsmelting \n3 3 3 3 3 3? 3 1 3 \nIf it can be proved that the method chosen is less hazardous than mercury, there is no loss \nof gold and that the time taken is comparable, perhaps the miners may be willing to try it. \nDirect smelting has the best theoretical features though the method is not fully developed. \nSmelting is used by gold buyers to process the sponge gold that they buy from the miners \nand hence it is technology that miners know and trust and therefore has some chance of \nacceptance. \nSmelting may be carried out in crucibles and after adding fluxes to the concentrate; \nthe charge is heated to above 1200\u00b0C on charcoal, liquefied petroleum gas or palm kernel \nshell fired stoves. The main types of flux utilised include sodium tetraborate (borax), \npotassium nitrate, sodium carbonate and silica sand. The ratios utilised depend on the \ntype of material to be smelted. It is simple cheap technology. The method can use \nrelatively small crucibles so is suitable for small batches of ore, which satisfies concerns \nabout visibility and traceability. Work undertaken by Amankwah and Buah (1998) shows \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n    The identification and testing of a method 301    \n \n    \n \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n       \n \nthat this method is more cost-effective than amalgamation followed by retorting, and it \nalso produces a purer end product. In addition, coated and fine floury gold that is not \neasily captured during amalgamation or may be lost in the process of \u2018squeezing out\u2019 \nexcess mercury may be captured in the bullion produced. \nThis method has considerable potential and can fulfil all the criteria as a substitute  \nfor amalgamation. Although it requires further development, much like some of the \nchemical methods described previously, it has the advantage of using inexpensive easily \navailable materials. Moreover, the starting knowledge lay with members of the research \nteam at Tarkwa, which makes further development during the life of the project feasible. \nExpertise will remain in-country with the Tarkwa staff and not just with foreign \nconsultants that disappear at the end of the project. This has great benefits for on-going \ndevelopment, implementation and sustainability. \n5 Strategy for development \nIt was agreed that direct smelting should be the method selected for testing and \ndevelopment. A programme of laboratory tests was implemented and carried out to fully \nexamine the method in terms of efficiency, limits on the purity of concentrate that can be \nprocessed, and efficiency of different fluxes. The aims of the development and test work \nwere as follows: \n1 To make sure that it works and is effective. Test works were to be conducted to \ndevelop a suitable flux composition for the two major types of concentrates that \nsmall-scale miners encounter (sulphidic and non-sulphidic). \n2 To show that it is as fast as amalgamation, and measure the time required for each \nprocess. For a given weight of sample, measure the time taken for a small-scale \noperator to go through:  \na amalgamation \nb separation of amalgam from black sands \nc squeezing of excess mercury \nd heating the amalgam in the open air \ne smelting and weighing of the sponge gold. \nThis will then be compared with the drying and smelting of a similar weight of \nconcentrate. \n3 To show that it is efficient, and quantify recoveries for each process. This can be \ndone by buying a known weight of gold after it has gone through amalgamation, \nheating and smelting. This can then be put back into the black sands and smelted.  \nIf either the weight or purity of gold obtained from direct smelting is higher, the \nminers may be convinced. However, this should be done several times so there  \nis no doubt that the method is reliable. \n \n \n \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   302 M.T. Styles et al.    \n \n    \n \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n       \n \n6 Conclusions \nThe Characterisation Survey showed that in Ghana, the ASM gold miners can be \nconsidered as two separate groups: alluvial miners and hard rock miners. The former \nexcavate gold-bearing gravel and sand that is only loosely consolidated. This gold can be \nliberated by washing\/scrubbing; is relatively coarse \u2013 mostly greater than 250 \u00b5m; and is \ncaptured in sluice boxes or by hand panning. This coarse gold is relatively easy to \nseparate from the heavy concentrate by hand picking or the \u2018blow and tap\u2019 method.  \nThe miners, in many places, do not use mercury.  \nThe second group is the hard rock miners, who work gold-bearing quartz veins  \nand have to crush it to a very fine powder, as most of the gold grains are very small,  \nless than 100 \u00b5m. They process the crushed ore with sluice boxes and gold is extracted \nfrom the heavy concentrates by amalgamation. The amalgam produced is heated in open \nfires or with blowlamps at the mining site and the mercury vapour released is a major \nhazard. This group clearly need an effective alternative to amalgamation but as the gold \nis fine-grained, this is a difficult problem to solve. \nA range of possible methods were evaluated and the direct smelting process appears \nto have a good chance of meeting these demands and was chosen for further development \nand testing. The results of the second phase of the project are given by Amankwah et al. \n(2009). \nAcknowledgements \nThe authors are grateful to the European Union for sponsoring the project under  \nthe Ghana Mining Sector Support Programme.
