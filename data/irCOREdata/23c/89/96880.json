D(0)\"0, D(u)\u20190 \u2200u3(0, 1],\n4. D3C2\n*0,1+\n, D@(u)\u20190 \u2200u3[0, 1] and D@@(0)\u20190.\nWe also require the conditions: u (x, 0)\"u\n0\n(x) with 06u\n0\n(x)61 where u\n0\nis\na piecewise differentiable function on R and 06\/(m)61 \u2200m3(!R, #R).\nNote that because of condition 3, equation (1) is of parabolic type for all u\u20190\nand degenerates into an ODE at u\"0. The degeneracy of equation (1) results\nin two specific features of its solutions which do not appear in equations with\nconstant diffusion coefficient: 1. the finite speed of propagation through space,\nand 2. the existence of weak solutions, particularly those solutions with\ndiscontinuous space derivative.\nNote that u\n1\n(x, t),0, u\n2\n(x, t),a and u\n3\n(x, t),1 are homogeneous and\nstationary solutions of equation (1). They play a key role in the asymptotic\nbehaviour of the t.w.s. of this equation.\nGiven the appropriate physical interpretation of u in equation (1) this can\nbe seen as a generalization of those equations arising as models for different\nbiological systems. Thus (1) could represent the space-time dynamics of\na population (with population density u) showing an Allee effect and whose\nindividuals disperse to avoid crowded areas (see [3, 4, 6, 9, 17]). Meanwhile, if\nwe interpret u as the probability of occurrence of the allele A in a population\nwith two alleles (A and a), equation (1) is a generalization of that describing\nthe dispersion of the gene A in the heterozygote inferior case (see [2, 18]).\nFinally, if we interpret u as a membrane potential in a nerve axon, equation (1)\nis a generalization of Nagumo\u2019s equation arising in nerve conduction models\n(see [16]).\nAlthough very detailed analysis of travelling wave solutions (t.w.s.) to the\nconstant diffusion equation with non-linear kinetic term having the geometric\nproperties 1\u20142 above already exists in the literature, this is not the case for\ngeneralized degenerate non-linear Nagumo reaction-diffusion equations.\nSince the classic papers [10, 15] on t.w.s. for a constant diffusion equation\nwith quadratic-like kinetic part, much research has been developed to try to\nextend this analysis to more general reaction-diffusion equations. Particular\ncases of a density-dependent diffusion coefficient vanishing at u\"0, with\nreactive part having the qualitative properties listed above, have also\nbeen studied. For example, several authors have analysed the equation\nu\nt\n\"[um]\nxx\n#u (1!u) (u!a), where m\u20191 and a3 (0, 1), for specific values of\nm (see [3, 11, 13, 14]). Their results focus on the existence of a critical value,\nc*\u20190, of c for which the above equation has a sharp type solution and on the\nconvergence to t.w.s.\nIn this paper we extend previous analysis on existence of different types of\nt.w.s. to the general equation (1). We use a dynamical systems theory ap-\nproach, in which the problem of finding t.w.s. for (1) satisfying suitable\nboundary conditions, is equivalent to determining the set of parameters\n(which includes the speed c) for which there exist heteroclinic (or homoclinic)\ntrajectories for an autonomous system of two ordinary differential equations\n(ODEs). This system arises from transforming the original problem into\ntravelling wave coordinates.\nThe paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 contains a result on the sign of\nthe speed c of the t.w.s. of equation (1). There we also state the main result of\nthis paper. In Sect. 3 we outline the non-linear local analysis to obtain the\nlocal phase portrait of the transformed system of ODEs for the case c70. In\n714 F. Sa\u00b4nchez-Gardun8 o, P. K. Maini\nSect. 4 we carry out the global analysis for the case c\"0. We exhibit there the\nbifurcation of a heteroclinic cycle and illustrate our results with an example. In\nSect. 5 we begin the analysis of the whole phase portrait of the ODE system\nfor c\u20190 by obtaining some results on global behaviour which are related to\nthe existence of some t.w.s. of front (oscillatory and monotone) type. In Sect. 6\nwe use a couple of previous results obtained by the authors (see [20]) to prove\nthe existence and uniqueness of a critical value, c*, of c for which there exists\na travelling wave solution of sharp type. We illustrate the analytical results of\nthe paper by considering an example.\nSince the proofs of some results of this paper use similar techniques\ndeveloped in a previous publication ([20]), we will be concerned here more\nwith the consequences of the theory, rather than with developing the method-\nological aspects. In this sense the present work can be seen as an extension of\nthe aforementioned reference. Full details can be found in [19].\n2 Statement of the main result\nOur analysis starts by calculating the sign of the speed of t.w.s. of (1). For this\nlet D: [0, 1]PR be the function defined as:\nD (\/)\"P\n\u201d\n0\nD (w) g (w) dw , (2)\nwhere w\"\/ (m).\nProposition 2.1. Suppose sufficient conditions of smoothness of the functions\nD and g on the interval [0, 1]. Assume that equation (1) has t.w.s. whose\nbehaviour is as sketched in Fig. 1. For Figs. 1(a\u2014c), c\u20190. For Fig. 1(d), c\u20190 if\nand only if D(1)\u20190.\nProof. This can be obtained following a similar methodology to that given in\n[20]. We omit the details. K\nBefore we state the main result of this paper, we must mention that we\nhave adopted here the definition of sharp type solution of equation (1) from\n[20], which corresponds to a weak solution type for equation (1).\nOur theorem is:\nTheorem 1. If the functions D and g satisfy conditions 1\u20144 given in Sect. 1, then\nthere exists a unique value, c*\u20190, of the speed c, such that equation (1):\n1. has for c\"0: (a) an isolated pulse based at P\n0\nifD (1)\u20190; (b) an isolated\npulse based at P\n1\nif D (1)(0; (c) two stationary monotonic fronts: one\nconnecting the states 0 and 1 and the other connecting 1 to 0 if D (1)\"0,\n2. has an oscillatory front from 0 to a and another from 1 to a for each c such\nthat 0(c(c*(J4D(a)g@(a) ,\n3. has a unique travelling wave solution of sharp type from 1 to 0 for\na critical value, c*, of the speed c. For this value of c there exists an\noscillatory travelling wave from 0 to a,\nTravelling wave phenomena 715\nFig. 1a\u2013d. Different behaviours of t.w.s. for equation (1) depicted by continuous and\nbroken lines. For the waves depicted in a\u2013c the speed c is greater than zero. For d, c\u20190 if\nand only ifD(1)\u20190. The solution shown here is the so-called sharp type travelling wave (see\n[20] for the definition)\n4. does not possess t.w.s. connecting the homogeneous and stationary steady\nstates: i) u (x, t),1 and u(x, t),0, for D(1)60 and c\u20190 and\nii) u (x, t),0 and u(x, t),1 for D(1)\u20190,\n5. has two oscillatory travelling fronts for c*(c(J4D(a)g@(a): one from\n0 to a and another from 1 to a,\n6. has a monotonic decreasing front from 1 to a for each c such that\nc7J4D(a) g@(a) .\nFor the same values of c it has a monotonic increasing front from 0 to a.\nIn the following sections we outline the proof of Theorem 1 and refer the\nreader to [19] for fuller details.\n3 Local phase portrait for c70\nWe follow the aforementioned classical t.w.s. analysis introduced in [15]. The\nODE system can be obtained as follows. If a travelling wave solution\n716 F. Sa\u00b4nchez-Gardun8 o, P. K. Maini\nu(x, t)\"\/ (x!ct) of (1) exists, it must satisfy the ODE equation\nD(\/ (m))\/@@(m)#c\/@ (m)#D@ (\/) [\/@(m)]2#g(\/ (m))\"0 , (3)\nwhere the dash on D means the derivative with respect to \/, while that on\n\/ means the derivative with respect to m. By setting v\"\/@ equation (3) can be\nwritten as the singular (at \/\"0) ODE system\n\/@\"v\n(4)\nD (\/)v@\"!cv!D@(\/ )v2!g (\/) .\nThe singularity can be removed by introducing (see [3, 20]) the parameter\nq\"q(m) into (4) such that\ndq\ndm\n\" 1\nD(\/ (m))\n.\nIf we define \/ (m),\/(q (m)), v (q),v (q(m)) and denote by dot the derivative\nwith respect to q, system (4) can be re-written as the following non-singular\nsystem\n\/Q \"D (\/ )v\n(5)\nvR\"!cv!D@(\/)v2!g (\/ ) .\nEquation (5), together with the condition 06\/ (q)61 \u2200 q3 (!R, #R),\nconstitutes the re-statement in travelling wave coordinates of the original\nproblem.\nWe begin the phase portrait analysis by noting that system (5) has three\nequilibria: P\n0\n\"(0, 0), P\n1\n\"(1, 0), Pa\"(a, 0) and Pc\"(0, !c\/D@(0)). As\na consequence of the existence of four equilibria, equations (5) have a greater\nrichness of dynamics than those of the corresponding ODE system associated\nwith the degenerate Fisher-KPP equation, which has only three (see [20]).\nNevertheless, some of the techniques developed in that reference can be\nextended to the present case.\nThe local phase portrait of (5) can be obtained by using its local approxi-\nmation around each equilibria. For P\n1\n, Pa and Pc the linear analysis is\nsufficient to determine the local behaviour. However, since P\n0\nis a non-\nhyperbolic point for all values of c, we need higher order terms in the\napproximation (see [1] and the application of the Centre Manifold Theorem\n(see [7]). The result of the linear and the nonlinear analyses is:\nCase 1. If c\"0, P\n0\nis a saddle-like point, Pa a centre and P1 a saddle\npoint,\nCase 2. If c\u20190, P\n0\nis a saddle-node, P\nc\nand P\n1\nare saddle points, and Pa is\na locally stable: i) node if c274D(a) g@(a) or ii) focus if c2(4D(a) g@(a).\nThe local phase portrait of (5) is shown in Fig. 2.\nTravelling wave phenomena 717\nFig. 2a\u2013c. Local phase portrait of (5) for different values of c: a c\"0, b c2(4D (a) g@(a) and\nc c274D (a) g@(a)\nIn the next sections we determine the global phase portrait of (5) for c70\nfocusing on determining the existence of different heteroclinic and homoclinic\ntrajectories. We begin with the case c\"0.\n4 Bifurcation of a heteroclinic cycle for c\"0\nWe note that multiplying the right-hand side of (5) (with c\"0), by D, the\nsystem can be transformed into a hamiltonian-like system whose trajectories\ncoincide on the first and fourth quadrants of the \/v-plane with those of (5).\n718 F. Sa\u00b4nchez-Gardun8 o, P. K. Maini\nThe hamiltonian of the modified system is\nH(\/, v)\"1\n2\n[D (\/)v]2#P\n\u201d\n0\nD(w) g (w) dw . (6)\nBy using the geometrical properties of the level curves H (0, 0),0 and\nH(1, 0),D (1) of H (which in turn depend on those of D and g), one can prove\nthe following lemma which, actually, gives us the proof of item 1 in Theorem 1.\nLemma 4.1. System (5) with c\"0 has a:\n1. Homoclinic trajectory based in P\n0\n, if D (1)\u20190,\n2. Heteroclinic cycle from P\n0\nto P\n1\nand from P\n1\nto P\n0\n, if D (1)\"0,\n3. Homoclinic trajectory based in P\n1\n, if D(1)(0.\nThe solutions of (1) associated with the trajectories mentioned in the above\nlemma are illustrated in Fig. 3.\nIn the following example we illustrate the results contained in Lemma 4.1.\nExample 1. Here we consider the equation\nLu\nLt\n\" L\nLx C(bu#u2)\nLu\nLxD#u (1!u) (u!a) , (7)\nwhere b\u20190 and a3 (0, 1).\nFig. 3a\u2013c. Sketch of the solutions\nu(x, t)\"\/(x!ct) of (1) for c\"0 corresponding\nto the different conditions mentioned in Lemma\n4.1 for: a D (1)\u20190, b D (1)\"0 and c D (1)(0.\nThe broken lines represent the periodic solutions\nassociated with the closed trajectories of (5).

(9)\nThis relationship divides the plane of parameters into regions for which\nsystem (8) has one homoclinic connection based at P\n0\nor based at P\n1\n. The\nplane of the parameters and the phase portrait of system (8) showing the\nbifurcation of the heteroclinic cycle are illustrated in Fig. 4.\nFig. 4a\u2013d.

Numerically, it is difficult to\npick the stable or unstable manifolds for this case, so we illustrate the trajectory by\nhand.\n720 F. Sa\u00b4nchez-Gardun8 o, P. K. Maini\n5 Monotonicity and the existence of some fronts\nIn this section we prove some monotonicity properties of the paths of the\ntrajectories of system (5) and the existence of certain types of heteroclinic\nconnections. We introduce the following notation: Let \u2026u\nc\n(P\n1\n) and \u2026s\nc\n(P\nc\n)\ndenote the left unstable and the right stable manifolds of (5) at P\n1\nand P\nc\n,\nrespectively.\nWe begin the global analysis by addressing the behaviour of the vertical\nnull-clines of (5):\n\u00bb\n1\n(\/)\"!c#Jc2!4D@(\/)g(\/)\n2D@(\/)\nand \u00bb\n2\n(\/)\"!c!Jc2!4D@(\/)g(\/)\n2D@ (\/)\n.\n(10)\nTheir shape changes with c as is shown in Fig. 5 in which we have also\ndrawn the vector field defined by (5), the way in which \u2026u\nc\n(P\n1\n) is leaving\nP\n1\nand the form in which \u2026s\nc\n(P\nc\n) approaches P\nc\n.\nBefore we continue with the proof we first give a brief conceptual overview\nof the analysis presented in this and subsequent sections. This can be sum-\nmarized in the following three cases corresponding to different values of c:\n1. For sufficiently small positive values of c, the phase portrait of (5) looks\nlike that illustrated in Fig. 6(a),\n2. For sufficiently large values of c, namely c\u20190 such that\nc27M,max[4D(\/)g(\/)], where the maximum is taken on [0, 1], the\nphase portrait of (5) is as in Fig. 6(b),\n3. For intermediate values of c we have a rich dynamics, including the\nexistence and uniqueness of a saddle-saddle heteroclinic trajectory for\na critical value, c*, of c.\nFirstly we eliminate the parameter q in (5). This leads to the equation\ndv\nd\/\n\"!cv!D@ (\/)v2!g (\/)\nD (\/) v\n.

P\n1\nto P\n0\nfor D(1)60.\nIn terms of the t.w.s. dynamics of (1), Lemma 5.2 means that for c70 there\nare no t.w.s. satisfying: \/ (!R)\"0 and \/ (#R)\"1 for D (1)\u20190 and 2.\n\/(!R)\"1 and \/(#R)\"0 for D (1)60. Hence item 4. in Theorem 1 is\nproved.\nBy noting that the function\n\u00bb (\/, v)\"1\n2\n[D(\/)v]2#[D (\/)!D (a)] (14)\nis a Lyapunov function for (5) for the equilibrium Pa and by considering the\nbehaviour of the trajectories of (5) approaching the horizontal axis coming\nfrom P\n0\nand from P\n1\n, we can prove the following lemma:\nLemma 5.3. 1. If D(1)\u20190 then for each c\u20190, (5) has a heteroclinic trajectory\nfrom P\n0\nto Pa which: a) oscillates around Pa if 0(c(J4D(a)g@ (a) or b) is\nmonotone if c7J4D(a)g@(a).\n2. If D (1)60, then for each c\u20190, (5) has a heteroclinic trajectory from\nP\n1\nto Pa which: a) oscillates around Pa if 0(c(J4D (a) g@(a) or b) is mono-\ntone if c7J4D(a) g@(a).\nThe above lemma contains information on the t.w.s. dynamics of (1) but,\ngiven that the bounds of c will be refined in the next section, we do not state\nthe result in those terms.\nWe now proceed to analyse more closely the dynamics of the manifolds\n\u2026 u\nc\n(P\n1\n) and \u2026 s\nc\n(P\nc\n) for the case D(1)\u20190 as c increases.\nTravelling wave phenomena 723\n6 The existence and uniqueness of a sharp front\nWe start by considering large values of c. The following proposition holds:\nProposition 6.1. For c such that c27max [4D@(\/)g (\/)] the manifold \u2026 s\nc\n(P\nc\n)\nleaves (in reverse time) the region R,M(\/, v) D0(\/(1, v(0N somewhere on\nM(\/, v) D\/\"1, v(0N. Meanwhile for all c70, \u2026u\nc\n(P\n1\n) enters the region R.\nProof. For the first part the reasoning is similar to that given in [20], Lemma\n1. It uses the vector field defined by (5) and the vertical null-clines (10) shown\nin Fig. 5. The second part is immediate by using the local linear analysis\naround P\n1\ndeveloped in Sect. 3. h\nProposition 6.1 allows us to conclude that for the above values of c the\nmanifold \u2026 u\nc\n(P\n1\n) entering the region R has, in principle, two possible behav-\niours as qPR: either it tends to Pa or it tends to P0 . Now we clarify the\nactual behaviour of \u2026 u\nc\n(P\n1\n) and \u2026 s\nc\n(P\nc\n) for c\u20190.\nTo begin, note that for all u3[a, 1] equation (1) is a non-degenerate\nFisher-KPP equation and one can use the t.w.s. analysis carried out in [8] and\n[12], which reduces the analysis for equation u\nt\n\"[D(u)u\nx\n]\nx\n#g(u) to that for\nu\nt\n\"u\nxx\n#D (u)g (u). Hence we can use the result for the ODE system of those\nequations, to prove the following lemma:\nLemma 6.1. For each c7cN with cN such that\nJ4D (a) g@ (a)6cN 6SsupC4\nD(\/) g(\/)\n(\/!a) D , (15)\nwhere the sup is taken on \/3 (a, 1), system (5) has two:\n1. Damped heteroclinic trajectories for cN\"J4D (a)@(a) : one from P\n1\nto\nPa and the other from P0 to Pa ,\n2. Monotone heteroclinic trajectories for cN\u2019J4D(a) g@(a) : one from P\n1\nto\nPa and the other from P0 to Pa.\nNow let us consider small values of c. We can prove the following\nproposition:\nProposition 6.2. Suppose that D(1)\u20190. \u201ehen, for sufficiently small (posi-\ntive) values of c:\n1. \u2026u\nc\n(P\n1\n)P(0, !R) as qPR,\n2. \u2026 s\nc\n(P\nc\n) leaves (in reverse time) the region R somewhere on (a, 1),\n3. \u201ehe trajectory leaving P\n0\nends at Pa.\nProof. Items 1 and 2 follow by using continuity of the solutions of (5) with\nrespect to the speed c and Lemma 4.1 (items 1 and 2, respectively). Item\n3 follows by using Lemma 6.1. h\nSo far in this section we have analysed the behaviour of \u2026s\nc\n(P\nc\n) and \u2026u\nc\n(P\n1\n)\nfor small and large values of c. Now we consider intermediate values of c. For\nthis, we can use a couple of results proved previously (see [20]).\n724 F. Sa\u00b4nchez-Gardun8 o, P. K. Maini\nLet (\/\nc\n, v\nc\n) be the point where the manifold \u2026 s\nc\n(P\nc\n) leaves (in reverse time)\nthe region R. We define\nc*\"inf Mc Dc\u20190, \/\nc\n\"1, v\nc\n(1)(0N , (16)\nto prove the following lemma:\nLemma 6.2 (Existence and Uniqueness). For D(1)\u20190, there exists a value,\nc*\u20190, of c, such that the trajectory \u2026sc* (Pc*) is the unique trajectory connecting\n(in reverse time) the point Pc* to the point P1\n.\nProof. This follows the same reasoning as that given in [20], so we omit the\ndetails. h\nBy using continuity arguments on the solutions of (5) with respect to the\nparameter c and all the results proved in the above sections, we can summa-\nrize the dynamics of the heteroclinic connections of (5) forD (1)\u20190 and c\u20190\nas follows:\nLemma 6.3. For D (1)\u20190, (5) has:\n1. No heteroclinic trajectory from P\n0\nto P\n1\nfor c\u20190,\n2. An oscillatory heteroclinic trajectory (oscillating around Pa) connecting\nP\n0\nwith Pa for each c such that 0(c(c*(J4D(a) g@(a) ,\n3. \u201ewo heteroclinic trajectories for c\"c* : one of oscillatory type (oscillat-\ning around Pa ) from P0 to Pa and one of saddle-saddle type connecting\nP\n1\nwith Pc* ,\n4. \u201ewo oscillatory (oscillating around Pa) heteroclinic trajectories for\nc*(c(J4D(a) g@(a): one from P\n0\nto Pa and the other from P1 to Pa ,\n5. \u201ewo heteroclinic trajectories for c7J4D(a) g@(a): one from P\n0\nto Pa and\nthe other from P\n1\nto Pa . Both are damped when equality occurs and they\nare monotone in the case of strict inequality.\nIf we interpret each of the heteroclinic trajectories, whose existence has\nalready been proved above, as the corresponding different types of t.w.s. for\nequation (1), we conclude the proof of Theorem 1. h\nWe illustrate the analytical results obtained in the above sections by\nconsidering an example:\nExample 2. Here we consider equation (1) with D(u)\"bu#u2 and\ng(u)\"u (1!u) (u!a), where b\u20190 and a3 (0, 1).\nThe corresponding non-singular ODE system (5) takes the form\n\/Q \"(b\/#\/2 )v\n(17)\nvR\"!cv!(b#2\/)v2!\/(1!\/ ) (\/!a) .\nThe equilibria for this system are: P\n0\n\"(0, 0), P\n1\n\"(1, 0), Pa\"(a, 0) and\nP\nc\n\"(0, !c\/D@ (0)). Figure 7 shows the phase portrait of (17) for different\nTravelling wave phenomena 725\nFig. 7a\u2013d. Phase portrait of system (17) for different values of c: a c\"0.1: Here there exists\nonly the P\n0\nto Pa connection (thick broken line). b c\"0.201: This is an approximation to\nthe critical value of c for which there exists a saddle(P\n1\n) -saddle(P\nc\n) heteroclinic trajectory\n(thick line). Also for this value of c we have an oscillatory connection from P\n0\nto Pa (thick\nbroken line). c c\"0.3: Here there are two oscillatory heteroclinic trajectories; from P\n0\nto\nPa (thick broken line) and from P1 to Pa (thick line). d c\"1.0: Here there are two\nmonotonic heteroclinic connections, one from P\n0\nto Pa (thick broken line) and the other\nfrom P\n1\nto Pa (thick line)\nvalues of c with b\"2 (the qualitative features of the phase portrait do not\nchange with b). The dynamics shown in Fig. 7 agrees with the analytical\nresults contained in this paper. Note that for c+0.201 we have the saddle-\nsaddle heteroclinic connection. Associated with this trajectory we have the\nsharp type solution for the corresponding equation (1) with D and g as above\n(see [20] for the definition of sharp type solution).\nNumerical simulations of the partial differential equation strongly suggest\nthat the sharp type solution is stable for a step function initial condition and\nthe final speed attained by the wave agrees very closely with that predicted by\nthe phase portrait analysis corresponding to the saddle-saddle heteroclinic\ntrajectory.\n726 F. Sa\u00b4nchez-Gardun8 o, P. K. Maini\n7 Conclusions and discussion\nWe conclude this paper addressing the points below:\n1. The rich dynamics of system (5) comes mainly from the geometric\nproperties of g. It is remarkable how this leads to a wider range of\nheteroclinic and homoclinic trajectories compared with those of the\ndegenerate Fisher-KPP equation (see [20]). Consequently, equation (1)\nexhibits a greater richness of t.w.s. behaviour than that of the degener-\nate Fisher-KPP equation.\n2. The degeneracy of equation (1) is responsible for the existence of the\nsharp type solution for that equation, while the uniqueness comes from\nthe monotonicity of the solutions of equation (11) with respect to c.\n3. The numerical simulations carried out on the full PDE suggest that for\na step function initial condition, the sharp travelling wave solution of\n(1), for D and g given in Example 2, is stable. The rigorous proof of\nconvergence to the different types of t.w.s. for the general equation (1),\nwhose existence has been proved in this paper, is still an open problem.\nAcknowledgements.
