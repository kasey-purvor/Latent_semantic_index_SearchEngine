(1)  \u201cRSV infection does not cause \nasthma but is an indicator of the genetic predisposition to asthma\u201d counter Thomsen and \ncolleagues in this issue. (2) The two papers follow up on a discussion that has been going on \nfor decades. It is undisputed that infants hospitalized with a lower respiratory tract infection \ncaused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) more often report subsequent childhood wheeze. \nWhat remains unclear is the direction of causation: does RSV infection confer a long-term \nchange in the host which increases the risk of subsequent asthma? Or is a hospitalization with \nRSV bronchiolitis simply an early marker of an underlying predisposition for reversible airway \ndisease (i.e. asthma)?   \nWhat do the two new papers contribute to this debate?  Wu and colleagues, analyzing data \nfrom 95,000 infants from a state-based health-care program in Tennessee, found that children \naged four months at the winter virus peak had an increased risk of bronchiolitis in infancy and of \nasthma during childhood. (1) These results add convincing evidence to another old dispute \u2013 \nwhether there is an association between season of birth and risk of asthma (3, 4) - but \ncontribute little to clarify causation. The smoothed curves suggesting that children born in \nSeptember bear the highest risk of later asthma could be explained, as the authors suggest, by \nthe timing of birth 4 months prior to the winter virus peak. Other explanations include birth  8 \nmonths prior to the pollen peak, or some critically timed exposure during fetal life, (5) in short, \nany seasonally varying exposure. Although the authors point out that that the curves shifted with \nchanging virus peaks from year to year, a statistical test supporting this statement, e.g. \ncomparing the infants\u2019 age at the winter virus peak to their age at a fixed calendar date, is \nmissing. Moreover, in the 20% of children who had had clinical bronchiolitis, risk of asthma was \nnot predicted by the age they were ill, but by their age when the national virus peak occurred. \nThis is surprising. If we hypothesize that RSV bronchiolitis confers developmental damage, this \nshould happen when the child itself is ill, but not when other children are ill. Finally, the parallel \ntrend in hospitalizations for bronchiolitis and asthma in the US is prone to ecological fallacy and \nprovides no evidence for an association between the RSV and asthma at the individual level, \nmuch less for causality.  \nThe current paper by Thomsen and colleagues makes a more convincing attempt to detect \ncausality in the RSV-asthma association. (2) Using a large dataset of 8,280 twin pairs in \nDenmark, they fitted genetic variance components and direction of causation models to their \ndata. This method draws on cross-trait cross-twin correlations to resolve both the genetic \nrelatedness and the direction of causation between two traits, in this case RSV hospitalization \nand asthma. (6, 7) The authors found that the association between RSV and asthma was \nessentially due to genetic effects shared between these traits. Furthermore, a model in which \nRSV hospitalization causes asthma could be rejected by statistical testing, while one in which \nasthma causes RSV could not. These twin data thus quite clearly contradict the hypothesis of a \ncausal effect of RSV on asthma, suggesting that the observed association is due to shared \ngenetic predisposition.  \nBoth papers suffer from poor phenotype definitions for RSV infections and for asthma, which \nmakes the findings hard to interpret. An RSV infection was simply defined as discharge \ndiagnosis with verified RSV infection. While 70% of infants have experienced an RSV infection \nby age one year, and 100% by age two, the host response to the virus varies greatly, including \nupper respiratory tract infections, typical bronchiolitis (with crepitations but no wheeze), or RSV-\ninduced wheezy bronchitis. It has been suggested that RSV-associated wheezy bronchitis, but \nnot typical bronchiolitis might be associated with subsequent atopy and asthma. (8, 9) On the \nother hand, infections by other viruses, particularly rhinoviruses, are followed by recurrent \nwheeze, (10) suggesting that the host response, rather than the type of virus, predicts later \noutcome.  \nAsthma phenotype was poorly defined in both studies. There is much evidence suggesting that \nthere are several phenotypes of early childhood wheezing disease. (11, 12)  Using the old \numbrella term \u201casthma\u201d which ignores this heterogeneity may be misleading, particularly when \ninvestigating pathways and causation. In the Danish paper, asthma was defined as a discharge \ndiagnosis of asthma at any time, or a parent report of \u201casthma ever in life\u201d collected at age 3-5 \nyears. Another recently published manuscript from the Danish group, which analyzed causality \nby applying a different statistical approach (time to event analysis) to the same twin dataset, \nreveals that a large proportion of these \u201casthma\u201d hospitalizations occurred in one year olds and \nthat the relative risk of \u201casthma\u201d falls to unity one year after RSV infection. (13) This suggests \nthat most children with so-called \u201casthma\u201d might have had recurrent viral wheeze, a largely self-\nlimiting disorder of which RSV lower airway disease may simply be one manifestation. Indeed \nthe Danish studies provide further indirect evidence in support of the contention that there are \nseveral phenotypes of early childhood wheezing disease. Cohort studies assessing asthma \noutcomes at different ages have in fact suggested that the association between RSV infections \nand later wheeze wanes with time, and that there is no association with atopy (14) (15).  \nTo summarize, we think these new data are more in favor of the hypothesis that the association \nbetween RSV and asthma is due to shared predisposition rather than to a causal effect of RSV. \nHowever, clearer phenotype definitions both of early childhood viral disease (\u201cbronchiolitis\u201d) and \nof subsequent recurrent wheezing disorders (\u201casthma\u201d) are absolute requisites for making any \nfurther progress in discovering the pathways leading to childhood asthma. Without specifying \nwhat disorders we are dealing with, this type of epidemiological or genetic research will remain \ninconclusive.  \n \nReferences \n \n1. Wu, P., W. D. Dupont, M. R. Griffin, K.
