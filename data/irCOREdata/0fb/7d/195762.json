The Earth\u2019s magnetosphere was very strongly dis-\nturbed during the passage of the strong shock and the fol-\nlowing interacting ejecta on 21\u201325 October 2001. These\ndisturbances included two intense storms (Dst\u2217\u2248\u2212250 and\n\u2212180 nT, respectively). The cessation of this activity at the\nstart of 24 October ushered in a peculiar state of the mag-\nnetosphere which lasted for about 28 h and which we dis-\ncuss in this paper. The interplanetary field was dominated\nby the sunward component [B=(4.29\u00b10.77, \u22120.30\u00b10.71,\n0.49\u00b10.45) nT]. We analyze global indicators of geomag-\nnetic disturbances, polar cap precipitation, ground magne-\ntometer records, and ionospheric convection as obtained\nfrom SuperDARN radars. The state of the magnetosphere is\ncharacterized by the following features: (i) generally weak\nand patchy (in time) low-latitude dayside reconnection or\nreconnection poleward of the cusps; (ii) absence of sub-\nstorms; (iii) a monotonic recovery from the previous storm\nactivity (Dst corrected for magnetopause currents decreas-\ning from \u223c\u221265 to \u223c\u221235 nT), giving an unforced decreased\nof \u223c1.1 nT\/h; (iv) the probable absence of viscous-type in-\nteraction originating from the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) insta-\nbility; (v) a cross-polar cap potential of just 20\u201330 kV; (vi) a\npersistent, polar cap region containing (vii) very weak, and\nsometimes absent, electron precipitation and no systematic\ninter-hemisphere asymmetry. Whereas we therefore infer the\npresence of a moderate amount of open flux, the convection\nis generally weak and patchy, which we ascribe to the lack of\nsolar wind driver.

Farrugia\n(charlie.farrugia@unh.edu)\n1 Introduction\nThe terrestrial magnetosphere interacts continuously with\nthe magnetized solar wind flow. The basic form of inter-\naction is a compression\/dilation caused by a variable solar\nwind dynamic pressure. Major forms of geomagnetic activ-\nity depend crucially on the orientation of the interplanetary\nmagnetic field (IMF). For southward IMF, these include en-\nhanced plasma convection (Dungey, 1961; Cowley, 1982);\nerosion of magnetic flux from the dayside and its trans-\nport to the nightside, producing a dilated polar cap (Burch,\n1972); episodes of explosive energy conversion in the ge-\nomagnetic tail called substorms (McPherron et al., 1973);\nand an energized ring current during storms. For northward\nIMF, reconnection at high latitudes (Dungey, 1963; Russell,\n1972; Maezawa, 1976) may lead to cross-polar cap poten-\ntials of several tens of kV (Cumnock et al., 1992; Freeman\net al., 1993; Knipp et al., 1993) while viscous-type interac-\ntions (Axford and Hines, 1961), most notably the Kelvin-\nHelmholtz instability (Dungey, 1955; Southwood 1979), can\nexcite geomagnetic pulsations (Southwood, 1974; Chen and\nHasegawa, 1974). Is the magnetosphere ever in a \u201cground\u201d\nstate where this diverse activity is switched off or operating at\na very low level? In this paper we report on a time interval on\n24\u201325 October 2001 when the IMF was pointing very nearly\nsunward with smaller and variable By and Bz components\nsuch that little solar wind-magnetosphere coupling might be\nexpected. In fact, the magnetosphere appeared to be variably\nbut near-continuously driven, albeit at a remarkably low rate.\nInterestingly, this state was preceded by one of the most\ndisturbed periods in this solar cycle, where two major en-\nhancements of the ring current, each accompanied by a burst\nof substorm activity, were recorded. The interplanetary cause\nof this activity was a merger of at least two ejecta driving a\nstrong shock. The passage at Earth of such mergers (often\ncalled \u201ccomplex ejecta\u201d (Burlaga et al., 2001, 2002) are typi-\ncally of long duration \u2013 of the order of several days \u2013 and thus\nPublished by Copernicus GmbH on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n192 C. J. Farrugia et al.: Magnetosphere under weak forcing\nthe disturbances they elicit may last for a long time. Here\nwe focus on the ejecta merger which passed Earth on 21\u201325\nOctober 2001. We shall in this paper characterize the state\nof the magnetosphere when the intense activity attending the\npassage of the earlier portion of this configuration, including\nthe shock, had subsided. We shall find almost quiescent con-\nditions with, however, a number of peculiar features which\nmay be a residue of the previous activity.\n2 Observations\n2.1 Interplanetary observations\nInterplanetary parameters for the 5-day interval 21\u201325 Oc-\ntober 2001, are shown in Fig. 1, which displays plasma and\nmagnetic field measurements made by the ACE spacecraft\nfrom near the L1 libration point \u223c220RE (Earth radii) up-\nstream of Earth. The data were acquired by the MAG (mag-\nnetic field) and SWEPAM (plasma) instruments at a temporal\nresolution of 16 s and 64 s, respectively. Plotted are the pro-\nton density, bulk speed, temperature, dynamic pressure, the\n\u03b1 particle-to-proton number density ratio, total field strength\nand its GSM components, and the proton plasma \u03b2. The red\ntrace in the third panel is the proton temperature expected\nfor the expanding solar wind resulting from statistical stud-\nies (Lopez, 1987).\nA strong shock (compression ratios in the density and\nmagnetic field strength of \u223c3) passes the spacecraft at\n\u223c16:00 UT on 21 October 2001 (first vertical guideline).\nBehind the shock very strong magnetic field strengths are\nobserved as is also an undulating density profile reaching\nvery large values (\u223c50 cm\u22123). Just after the last of these,\nthe ejecta is entered (second vertical guideline). The time\nof entry may be inferred from the enhancement in the al-\npha\/proton number density ratio, the generally strong fields,\nand the low proton temperatures (where by \u201clow\u201d we un-\nderstand lower than the expected temperature), and proton\n\u03b2<1. These features continue \u2013 with a notable exception\nduring \u223c01:00\u201302:00 UT, 23 October, when there is a mag-\nnetic field strength decrease and \u03b2 rises above unity \u2013 up to\nthe arrival of a second shock at 08:00 UT, 25 October. One\nmay note the generally declining V -profile (panel 2) from\nafter the arrival of leading shock to the arrival of a second\nshock advancing into the ejecta merger. This simple speed\nprofile is one of the features characterizing complex ejecta\n(see example 1 in Burlaga et al., 2002). The magnetic field\nin the interval of interest (03:25 UT, 24 October\u201307:25 UT,\n25 October at ACE; bracketed by the last two vertical guide-\nlines) is remarkable in that it is dominated by a sunward (Bx)\ncomponent with smaller and variable east-west and north-\nsouth components (Bx=4.29\u00b10.77 nT; By=\u22120.30\u00b10.71 nT,\nand Bz=0.49\u00b10.45 nT). Further striking features are a field\nof low fluctuation (B=4.40\u00b10.78 nT) in a plasma of very low\nproton temperature (T=6600\u00b12710 K) and \u03b2 (\u223c0.04) con-\ntaining periods of elevated \u03b1-particle concentrations with re-\nspect to the protons (up to 15%). The dynamic pressure\n(=0.94\u00b10.25 nPa) is substantially lower than the long-term\naverage of 2.0 nPa, and fairly steady. These quiet values\nmay be contrasted with the earlier interval on 21\u201323 October,\nwhere high and fluctuating densities, strong magnetic fields,\nand sporadically high temperatures may be seen. Studying\nthe coalescence, total or partial, of ejecta in the inner helio-\nsphere leading to complex ejecta, Farrugia and Berdichevsky\n(2004) showed that ejecta mergers may strengthen the lead-\ning shock, compress the field and plasma of the leading\nejecta, and heat the plasma. These are all factors which tend\nto intensify the geoeffectiveness of interplanetary configura-\ntions. This we believe is the cause of the contrast between\nthe earlier and later intervals. The interval of increasingly\nquiescent geomagnetic activity ends abruptly at 08:00 UT,\n25 October, when, as noted, a shock advances past ACE.\n2.2 Global indicators of disturbance\nMajor indices of geomagnetic activity are shown in Fig. 2.\nFrom top to bottom the panels display the Dst storm index\ncorrected for the effect of magnetopause currents (Dst\u2217), the\n3-hourly Kp index on a scale from 0 to 8; the auroral elec-\ntrojet indices AE and AL; and two measures of the cross-\npolar cap potential, one derived from SuperDARN convec-\ntion measurements (see Sect. 2.5) (black curve) and another\nfrom a statistical analysis of DMSP data reported by Boyle\net al. (1997; their Eq. 1). The AL index characterizes auroral\nactivity, a sharp drop by several hundred nT usually denot-\ning the presence of ionospheric currents associated with sub-\nstorms in the geomagnetic tail. Vertical guidelines delimit\nour study interval, where an estimated 45 min propagation\ndelay time from ACE to the ground has been taken into ac-\ncount. In the earlier interval there occur two strong enhance-\nments of the ring current indicated by the two minima in D\u2217st ,\ntwo bursts of substorm activity during the peaks in D\u2217st and\nKp, and a cross-polar cap potential maximizing at \u223c120 kV\n(black trace). (The results of Boyle et al. are not expected to\nagree with measured values at high solar wind electric fields,\nas in this early interval, because saturation sets in Russell\net al., 2001; Siscoe et al., 2002, at values typically above\n\u223c6 mV m\u22121; Mu\u00a8hlbachler et al., 2005.) By contrast, in the\ninterval of interest here, aside from a quasi-linear recovery of\ntheD\u2217st from the very strong, earlier activity, the other indices\nshow remarkably steady and low level activity. Particularly\nnoteworthy are the low values of the cross-polar cap poten-\ntial, ranging from below 20 kV to \u223c30 kV. By measuring the\nrate of plasma convection within the magnetosphere (Reiff et\nal., 1981; Stern, 1984), this quantity is a good indicator of the\nstrength of solar wind coupling. We now seek to character-\nize this state of the magnetosphere and the conditions under\nwhich it occurred.\nThe substorm indices above are average quantities.

Farrugia et al.: Magnetosphere under weak forcing\ndayside leading to a systematic shrinkage of the polar cap\nduring our interval, we examined Wind measurements. On\n24 October, the spacecraft was crossing the near-Earth tail\non the dawnside, moving from (\u221214.0, \u22125.4, 1.2) RE at\n04:00 UT to (\u221214.3, \u221221.6, 6.7)RE (GSM) at 18:00 UT,\nat which time it exited into the magnetosheath. The mea-\nsurements show a magnetic field dominated by its sunward\ncomponent (i.e. tailward stretched field), with a duskward\ncomponentBy=6.0\u00b11.4 nT and withBz=1.7\u00b11.4 nT (GSM).\nThe field strength decreased smoothly from \u223c24 nT to\n\u223c7 nT. There are no signs of abrupt rotations as might be as-\nsociated with dipolarizations of the magnetic field, i.e. there\nis no indication of return of open flux at substorm onsets.\n2.3 Polar cap precipitation\nIn an effort to see if dayside reconnection is ongoing dur-\ning our period of interest, we next examine the polar rain.\nCurrent notions ascribe this electron precipitation to coro-\nnal electrons which propagate in interplanetary space as a\nclosely field-aligned beam (the strahl) and gain access to the\npolar regions of Earth through reconnection on the dayside\n(see Fig. 1, Fairfield and Scudder, 1985). The polar cap\nprecipitation has long been known to exhibit a pronounced\nnorth-south asymmetry related to the sector structure of the\nIMF (Yaeger and Frank, 1976). For, as here, a toward sector\n(Bx>0), this asymmetry should favor the Southern Hemi-\nsphere where the reconnected field lines connect back to the\nSun.\nThe Polar spacecraft (orbital period \u223c18.5 h) made four\npasses over the polar regions, two on each day. Polar\nwas following an orbit lying approximately in the 22:00\u2013\n08:00 MLT plane, and rising in invariant latitude (ILT) up to\n\u223c88\u25e6. In the period we study, perigee (\u22481.51RE) occurred\nat \u223c13:00 MLT and apogee (\u22489.55RE) at \u223c22:00 MLT. We\nexamine first the passes over the northern polar cap. The\nrelevant data from the HYDRA instrument are plotted in\nFigs. 3a, b (top and bottom panels, respectively). The pan-\nels show the invariant latitude (ILT), the differential energy\nfluxes (DEF) of downflowing ions and electrons, the inte-\ngrated energy and number fluxes (electrons in red). In the\nnorthern polar cap, downflowing particles move parallel the\nfield, and we have plotted fluxes whose pitch angle lies in\nthe range 0 to 30\u25e6. The data, which have been corrected for\nspacecraft potential effects, have a time resolution of 13.8 s.\nThe passes over the Northern Hemisphere last many\nhours, with the spacecraft ascending slowly in ILT to\nabove 80\u25e6 while descending from apogee. They are in\nthe nightside region (MLT\u223c22:00\u201323:00). On the first\npass (Fig. 3a) significant electron DEFs are measured\nonly up to \u223c500 eV, and intensities are very weak start-\ning from 07:00 to 12:00 UT, with intermittent drop-outs\n(DEF<105 cm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121 (1E\/E)\u22121). Electron number\nfluxes are less than 106 cm\u22122 sr\u22121 s\u22121 and ion number fluxes\nare less than 105 cm\u22122 sr\u22121 s\u22121, a precipitation form classi-\nfied as \u201cvoid\u201d by Shinohara and Kokubun (1996; their Ta-\nble 1). The nightside boundary of the polar cap appears to be\ncrossed at \u223c07:00 UT and be located at \u223c73\u25e6.\nThe second pass, from 23:00 UT, 24 October to 07:00 UT,\n25 October (Fig. 3b), occurs in a similar MLT-ILT range as\nthe previous pass. Similar precipitation characterisitics are\nseen. The precipitation type may also be classified as void,\nexcept during sporadic, moderate enhancements such as oc-\ncur at \u223c01:00 UT and occasionally in 03:00\u201304:00 UT. Par-\ntial dropouts are also evident, particularly near the highest\nlatitudes later on in the pass. Again, the polar cap boundary\nat \u223c22:30 MLT appears to be located at \u223c73\u25e6 ILT.\nWe next consider the Southern Hemisphere passes\n(Figs. 4a, b), plotting this time fluxes antiparallel to the mag-\nnetic field (150\u2013180\u25e6 pitch angle range). The first pass shows\nconsiderably more intense precipitation than in the north,\nwith significant DEFs in energies up to 700 eV. A polar arc\n(at \u223c13:30 UT) and a burst of enhanced precipitation (at\n\u223c13:48\u201314:10 UT) bracket a region at the highest latitudes\n(above\u221280\u25e6 ILT) where the fluxes are intermittently as weak\nas in the northern polar cap. It is hard to locate the polar\ncap boundary. At \u223c21:30 MLT, if we place it at the start of\nthe gradient in electron precipitation at \u223c14:48 UT, it lies at\n\u223c\u221273\u25e6 ILT. At midmorning MLTs, if we place the polar cap\nboundary at the start of the polar arc observation, it would lie\nat \u223c\u221280\u25e6.\nThe second southern pass on 25 October shows a marked\ncontrast with the previous one. DEFs extend up to only\n500 eV, and the integrated energy fluxes (last-but-one panel)\nare weaker. There is essentially a void on the nightside por-\ntion (to the right). In the interval 07:36\u201307:45 UT at high\nILTs (78\u201388\u25e6) on the dayside (\u223c08:00 MLT) intense bursts\nof precipitation of energies reaching \u223c1 keV are present.\nThese are likely signatures of polar arcs. The polar rain\nobservations are still continuing at a ILT of \u223c\u221271\u25e6 when\na rapid energization occurs at\u223c08:45 UT, presumably on ar-\nrival of the shock seen at ACE \u223c45 min earlier (cf. Fig. 1).\nSummarizing, we have a polar cap precipitation which is\n(i) very weak, and sometimes absent, in the north; (ii) shows\nsome indications of a north-south asymmetry which, how-\never, becomes much attenuated as time progresses; and (iii)\nis confined to energies of a few hundred eV only. The pres-\nence of polar arcs were noted. In general, the observations\nsupport the idea of a low level of solar wind-magnetosphere\ncoupling. Two caveats on the interpretation should be borne\nin mind, both related to the weakness of the precipitation. (1)\nThe lack of obvious north-south asymmetry, in so far as this\nis a meaningful concept when the precipitation is so weak,\nmay be due to the fact that the ejecta field lines are connected\nat both ends to the Sun (Makita and Meng, 1987). (2) The\nextent of the open field line region is hard to pin down.

While the tracks\nof F12 and F15 are all in a 09:30\u201321:30 MLT orientation,\nF13 follows generally a dawn-dusk path and is best suited for\nour purposes. Whereas not all passes of F13 reached above\n80\u25e6 ILT to permit a sampling of the global convection, many\ndid. We thus chose to emphasize the F13 measurements. We\nsurveyed precipitation, flows and potential drops. All flow\nand potential data are 4 s averages. The potential is calcu-\nlated poleward of 50\u25e6 MLAT, defined as the zero potential\nvalue. The flows we examined are the values after corotation\nhas been removed but not after the constant offset to all points\nin order to force the ends to go to zero was performed. Previ-\nous work (Freeman et al., 1993) has shown that this does not\naffect results on the form of convection, i.e., it does not alter\nthe turning points of the potential, but does influence our es-\ntimate of the maximum potential drop. Freeman et al. (1993)\ncalculate that this typically leads to an underestimate of the\npotential drop by up to 10 kV.\nGeneral features of F13 observations were as follows:\n(1) small potential drops, of order 15\u201330 kV or less; (2)\nweak flows, rarely exceeding 0.5 km s\u22121 and most being\n<300 m s\u22121; (3) a general lack of coherent patterns across\nthe whole polar cap; (4) instead, the flows were generally ir-\nregular with several reversals or spiky fluctuations occuring\nover small spatial scales. (A 4 s time lapse is roughly equiva-\nlent to 30 km); (5) In the polar cap, ion fluxes were generally\nabsent, and electron fluxes were weak with significant count\nrates only up to a few hundred eV. No systematic north-south\nasymmetry was evident, although there was some variability\nabout this from pass to pass. (6) No systematic change in the\nextent of the polar cap regions was discernible. One may note\nthat the potential drops are underestimates, partly because of\nthe zero potential set at a given MLAT, mentioned above, and\npartly because the spacecraft track might not have reached\nhigh enough MLATs to sample the whole convection. How-\never, the correction is not likely to introduce any significant\nchange in the conclusions. Many flow patterns could be de-\nscribed as weak 2-cell patterns and\/or weak 1-cell patterns.\nOften they occupied only one part of the polar cap traversal.\nIn conclusion, we generally see weak, and patchy convection\nassociated with small potential drops. On occasion twin-cell\nconvection was present, also associated with low potential\ndrops. The flows and potentials from DMSP are later com-\npared with those from SuperDARN.\nFigures 5 and 6 are fairly representative of the obser-\nvations.

In each figure the panels show\nfrom top to bottom: ion density, magnetic field deflections,\nelectron and ion differential energy fluxes, horizontal (vio-\nlet) and vertical flows. Mantle precipitation bounds a polar\ncap area at the dawn and dusk terminator regions. The polar\nrain precipitation appears tenuous and seems confined to high\nMLATs on the dusk side and lower MLATs on the dawnside.\nThe electron precipitation in the polar caps occurs in energies\nup to \u223c500 eV.\nIn the pass shown in Fig. 5, during which F13 climbed\nto \u223c86\u25e6, there is evidence of a some antisunward flow con-\nfined to the dawn side of the polar cap, with little or none\nin the center of the polar cap. The associated potential\ndrop is very small and estimated as \u223c10 kV. Flows are less\nthan 300 m s\u22121 except for three brief excursions when they\nreached \u223c0.5 km s\u22121. In the south (Fig. 6), where again the\nspacecraft reached MLATs of \u223c85\u25e6, the precipitation inten-\nsity and energy range are comparable. There is evidence\nof a weak antisunward flow (\u223c200\u2013300 m s\u22121) at midafter-\nnoon MLTs which turns to weakly sunward outside the polar\ncap, thus formimg a weak 2-cell DC flow as indicated also\nby SuperDARN measurements detailed in Sect. 2.5 below.\nAcross this 2-cell pattern the potential drop is \u223c15 kV and\npeak flows reach 450 m s\u22121. Considering the region of an-\ntisunward flows, even if intermittent, as delineating the ex-\ntent of the open field line region, we have in Fig. 6 the po-\nlar cap boundary located approximately at \u221280\u25e6 (duskside)\nand \u221284\u25e6 (dawnside). Weak polar arcs associated with cor-\nrespondingly weak flows are observed on the duskside in\nthe north (\u223c84\u25e6 MLAT) and on the dawnside in the south\n(\u221282\u25e6 MLAT). This arc location is in both hemispheres on\nthe opposite sides of the moderately antisunward convection.\n2.4 Viscous interactions\nWe next investigate the possibility of viscous interaction. In\nstatistical studies of the polar cap potential, a residual po-\ntential difference not due to reconnection is often ascribed\nto viscous-type processes, which are believed to contribute\nsome 25\u201330 kV (e.g. Reiff et al., 1984; Cowley, 1986) or\neven less (Milan, 2004). This is approximately consis-\ntent with what we obtain from SuperDARN, the Boyle et\nal. (1997) empirical equation (Fig. 2, last panel), and the\nDMSP F13 passes we surveyed. However, the Kelvin-\nHelmholtz (KH) instability, a prime candidate thought to me-\ndiate these interactions, is apparently not operating during\nour interval. This is suggested by the ground magnetome-\nter records. According to the field line resonance theory of\nthe excitation of ULF geomagnetic pulsations by KH waves\nat the magnetopause and its boundary layers (Southwood,\n1974; Chen and Hasegawa, 1974), this instability would give\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/25\/191\/2007\/ Ann.

The red arrows\nindicate local midnight.\nrise to geomagnetic field pulsations in the Pc 5 range (2\u2013\n7 mHz). However, all ground magnetometer chains show just\na quiet field. As an example, Fig. 7 displays readings of the\nhorizontal component of the geomagnetic field at four sta-\ntions arranged in order of decreasing geomagnetic latitude\n(marked near the station designation). The top two stations\nare from the IMAGE chain (Viljanen et al., 1997), and the\nbottom two are from the 210 deg MM array (Yumoto et al.,\n1992). The inverted arrows mark local magnetic midnight\nat the respective stations. We see neither negative bays (i.e.,\nlocalized depressions of the geomagnetic field propagating\npoleward) at the auroral zone stations NAL and BJN, pre-\ncluding the possibility of substorms, nor pulsations at the\nmidlatitude station TIK, precluding in turn the possibility of\nKH instability (the irregular oscillations during early Octo-\nber 24 being presumably of solar wind dynamic pressure ori-\ngin). The steady increase in the readings at the low-latitude\nstation KAK reflects the steady recovery of the ring current,\nalso indicated in the D\u2217st profile in Fig. 2. This increase is in-\nterrupted by a wide depression centred near local noon. This\nis a quiet-time phenomenon (Sq-variation), thought to be the\neffect of neutral wind motions in the ionosphere (Nishida,\n1978). (It is subtracted when the Dst index is compiled.) We\nshould note, however, a possible restriction on this interpre-\ntation. Hall currents in the magnetosphere we are discussing\nmay be weak so that the lack of geomagnetic deflections on\nthe ground could conceivably be due to this rather than the\nabsence of KH instability.\n2.5 SuperDARN observations of the ionospheric flow\nThe Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN)\n(Greenwald et al., 1995) provides line-of-sight velocity mea-\nsurements of the high-latitude ionosphere in the Northern\nHemisphere. These measurements are routinely combined\nusing the \u201cMap Potential\u201d fitting technique (Ruohoniemi and\nBaker, 1998) to produce maps of large-scale ionospheric con-\nvection. We have examined the convection patterns for the\ncurrent interval and present a selection of them in Fig. 8.\nEach map is plotted in a magnetic latitude \u2013 magnetic lo-\ncal time coordinate system with noon to the top and dusk to\nthe left. Contours of constant electric potential are shown\nin black, with vectors representing the fitted radar measure-\nments shown in colour, scaled according to the bar on the\nright of each map. The concurrent IMF vector is shown in\nthe top right for reference and the total transpolar voltage is\ngiven in the bottom right.\nIn Fig. 8a we show two maps which are representative of\nthe nature of the flow over much of the interval. It is im-\nmediately evident that these flows do not fit within the tra-\nditional framework of convection classified in terms of the\nupstream IMF (as discussed by, for example, Cowley and\nLockwood, 1992). This is likely to be a direct consequence\nof the fact that the IMF itself is not easily characterized, often\nhaving By and Bz components which are small and variable,\nas noted in Sect. 2.1. Instead, the flows are characterized by\nlow-velocity, multi-celled patterns and regions of complete\nstagnation. Often, however, there is some evidence of a very\nlow level of driving, illustrated by the moderate twin-vortex\nconvection evidenced in Fig. 8b. There is also some enhance-\nment to the \u201creturn\u201d-type flows, although often the polar cap\nitself is essentially stationary. The transpolar voltage remains\nbelow 30 kV for much of the interval, often dipping below\n20 kV (as in Fig. 8a), in general agreement with an extremely\nlow level of dayside driving. Although data coverage is not\ncomplete, these values are also in good agreement with the\nBoyle empirical formula (Boyle et al., 1997; see Fig. 2 for\na comparison), which, for low polar cap potentials has been\nrepeatedly found to give a good estimate of the polar cap\npotential. They are also consistent with DMSP values. Be-\ntween \u223c14:00 and 20:00 UT data coverage from the radars\nwas particularly reduced. However, there is nothing in the\nsupporting datasets to suggest that this period exhibited sig-\nnificantly different characteristics to those before and after.\nOverall, data coverage is remarkably good for such an ex-\ntended quiet interval.\nThe convection maps shown in Figs. 8a\u2013b give a good\nindication of the general nature of the flows throughout\nthe interval. There are, however, a number of short lived\n(20\u2013\u223c30 min) departures from this state, two examples\nof which are shown in Fig. 8c. These generally take\nthe form of enhancements to the nightside auroral zone\nflow and resemble the flow bursts discussed by Grocott et\nal. (2003, 2004, 2005).

Farrugia et al.: Magnetosphere under weak forcing\nIMF-northward, non-substorm intervals and were interpreted\nas signatures of reconnection in a \u201cquiet time\u201d tail. Although\nthe IMF By and Bz components were weaker during this in-\nterval than during those studied by Grocott et al., the bursty\nnature of the nightside activity does imply that some low-\nlevel dayside driving is likely to have been present. It is also\npossible that the preceding interval of intense activity (whose\nassociated flows are illustrated in Fig. 8d for comparison with\nthe present observations) could well have left the magneto-\nsphere suitably primed to unload itself in this fashion.\nWe now take a critical look at the use of the Map Poten-\ntial technique for flows as weak as we generally have in this\nperiod. We note first that the coverage of radar data is actu-\nally quite good. Second, the actual patterns suggested by the\ntechnique may not be totally reliable, but certainly the tech-\nnique is not making up the fact that the flows are very small.\nThird, it is the fact that the patterns are somewhat erratic \u2013\nsuggesting a lack of coherent and continued twin-vortex con-\nvection \u2013 which interests us here and not so much the detailed\nshape of the patterns themselves.\nTo probe our results further, we made an additional check\nwhere we reproduced the SuperDARN flow maps using a\nfalse IMF input (and hence a different statistical model input)\nwith Bz=\u22124 nT and found that the potential patterns changed\nremarkably little. Consider the right-hand map of Fig. 8a,\nfor example. The transpolar voltage showed just a 4 kV in-\ncrease (21 kV as opposed to 17 kV) with the false IMF model\napplied, whereas the model voltage itself for Bz=\u22124 nT is\n56 kV. For comparison, if the model were dictating the ac-\ntual map shown in Fig. 8a the voltage would be 27 kV, even\nfor northward IMF. We therefore conclude that the measured\nflow data is dominating the patterns and is clearly indicat-\ning convection which is weaker than might \u201cusually\u201d be ex-\npected.\n3 Discussion\nIn this paper we have discussed a most peculiar state of the\nmagnetosphere in which the polar cap contained a quantity\nof open flux yet only weak, and often sporadic, convection\noccurred. The initial state of the magnetosphere, i.e. one\nwhich contained a moderate-to-large amount of open flux,\ncan be easily explained by considering the previous activ-\nity caused by the passage of the ejecta merger. The lead-\ning part of the configuration, lasting for about 60 h, disturbed\ngeospace extensively and, in particular, gave rise to two in-\ntense (Dst<\u2212100 nT) storms and the consequent growth of\nthe polar cap. In contrast, the interval we have been ex-\namining elicited only weak particle precipitation in the po-\nlar cap, patchy and sometimes stagnant ionospheric convec-\ntion, a monotonic decrease in the total ring current energy,\nas measured by the Dst index, and an absence of substorms.\nWe may pictorially describe this magnetosphere as one ap-\nproaching a ground state.\nLet us consider the substorm recurrence rate. According to\nBorovsky et al. (1993), who undertook a broad survey of this\nquantity, the mean and standard deviation of the substorm\nrecurrence time are 4\u00b12 h. A 28-h substorm\u2013free interval is\nthus several standard deviations away from the mean of the\ndistribution. Another interesting point pertains to ring cur-\nrent recovery. Without competing mechanisms and in the\nabsence of fresh injection, the recovery seen here charac-\nterizes an intrinsic property of the ring current, namely its\n(unforced) decay time, a quantity important in ring current\nmodels. We obtain for this a value of \u223c1.1 nT h\u22121.\nThe steady nature of the polar cap showing no clear and\nsystematic tendency to shrink or expand over such a long pe-\nriod also relates to a lack of solar wind driving. On the one\nhand, there is no substantial evidence of significant and con-\ntinued flux removal from the dayside, offsetting any tendency\nfor the polar cap to expand, and on the other, no return of\nflux to the dayside via substorms was monitored, offsetting\nin turn any tendency for it to contract. Hence our suggestion\nthat the size of the polar cap is a remnant of activity during\nthe earlier strong phase of ejecta passage. The polar cap size\nis then maintained because in the later phase, the usual pro-\ncesses which shrink the polar cap are generally absent. So the\nquestion is, if there is no evidence of typical dayside driving,\nnor of substorm activity, what is generating the low level of\nconvection evidenced in the cross polar cap potentials shown\nin Fig. 2?\nIn their discussion of the excitation and decay of convec-\ntion in the magnetosphere-ionosphere system, Cowley and\nLockwood (1992) suggested that in the absence of both day-\nside and nightside reconnection, the flow in the system would\ncease irrespective of the amount of open flux present. In the\npresent case, we have a system in which there is no clear driv-\ning mechanism, yet convection is near-continuously driven,\nalbeit at a remarkably low rate. To investigate the possible\nnature of this dayside driving, we have computed the dayside\nreconnection voltage, Vrec=vB\u22a5Lf (\u03b8), where v is the solar\nwind speed, B\u22a5 is the magnetic field perpendicular to the\nflow direction, L is the length of the magnetopause recon-\nnection X-line, and \u03b8 is the IMF clock angle (i.e. polar angle\nin the GSM YZ-plane), for different coupling functions f (\u03b8)\nand values of L, and these are presented in Fig. 9. The top\nthree panels show the upstream IMF for our interval, with\ntheir solar wind-perpendicular components superimposed in\nred. In the bottom two panels the dayside reconnection volt-\nages are shown for f (\u03b8)= sin4(\u03b8\/2) and f (\u03b8)=1, for values\nof L set at 1, 5, 10 and 20RE . Firstly, it is clear from the\nvalues of B\u22a5x that the magnetic field was essentially paral-\nlel to the solar wind flow throughout the interval. Using this\nto compute the reconnection voltage (panels 4 and 5) then\ngives an indication of the possible coupling between the solar\nwind and magnetosphere. Looking first at panel 4, it is clear\nthat conventional approximations of the dayside reconnec-\ntion voltage imply essentially zero coupling for many hours\nover the interval. If this were true, however, then the\u223c20 kV\nAnn. Geophys., 25, 191\u2013205, 2007 www.ann-geophys.net\/25\/191\/2007\/\nC. J. Farrugia et al.: Magnetosphere under weak forcing 203\nFig. 9. The top three panels reproduce the components of the IMF, on top of which are shown in red the components of B perpendicular to the\nflow vector. The bottom two panels show two theoretical estimates of the reconnection rate parametrized by the length of the magnetopause\nreconnection X-line, L\ncross polar cap voltage evident in the radar data would, in the\nabsence of tail reconnection, have to be due entirely to vis-\ncous coupling. As was shown in Fig. 8, there is often some\nevidence of convection across the polar cap, which cannot be\ndue to a viscous interaction since this occurs only on closed\nfield lines. If the convection was due to tail reconnection then\na voltage of \u223c20 kV would easily close even a large polar\ncap over an interval as long as we are dealing with here. The\nfact that this does not occur provides further evidence that\nsome ongoing quasi-balanced dayside and nightside convec-\ntive driving must be occurring.\nPanel 5 of Fig. 9 shows the theoretical maximum recon-\nnection voltage for various L values if we were to assume\nthat the total solar wind electric field could couple to the\nmagnetosphere irrespective of the orientation of B\u22a5. This\nshows that, for L=5\u201310RE , voltages similar to the cross po-\nlar cap potentials discussed above could occur. We can only\nassume therefore that some dayside reconnection geometry\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/25\/191\/2007\/ Ann. Geophys., 25, 191\u2013205, 2007\n204 C. J. Farrugia et al.: Magnetosphere under weak forcing\nwith which we are not familiar is facilitating a low level\nof coupling in this case. Combining panels (4) and (5)\nleads us to suggest that, under these special circumstances,\nL (the geoeffective length) is large (of order \u223c10) and the\ndependence on clock angle, \u03b8 (i.e., the coupling function) is\nless strong than the sin4(\u03b8\/2), the Perreault-Akasofu (1978)\nfunction often employed. Then we would be able to recover\nthe \u223c20 kV voltage that we see.\nThe nature of the nightside component of the convection\nis more readily identifiable, and resembles the Grocott et\nal. (2003, 2004, 2005) nightside non-substorm reconnection\nbursts mentioned above. This form of tail reconnection was\ninitiated by the continued driving of the solar wind under\nthe influence of a strong and constant IMF By component,\nwhich is absent in the present case. However, a tendency of\nthe tail to respond to a modest driving of any kind in this\nfashion may be responsible for the present observations. In\nsummary, the trailing end of this complex ejecta may be char-\nacterized by the general absence of a coherent driver which is\nreflected in the lack of coherent and continued twin-vortical\nionospheric convection, the absence of substorms, a back-\nground polar cap potential and weak and occasionally absent\npolar cap precipitation.\nAcknowledgements.
