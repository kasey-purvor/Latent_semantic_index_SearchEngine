Expression \nprofiling revealed that the genes encoding these orthologues are differentially \nexpressed in various tissue types isolated from Arabidopsis. \n \nKey words: Arabidopsis, AUR1, expression, inositol phosphorylceramide, \nIPC synthase, sphingolipids  \n 3 \nIntroduction \n \nThe diverse, amphipathic sphingolipids consist of a long chain base backbone \nwith long-chain fatty acid and polar alcohol attachments. These lipid species \nare ubiquitous membrane components of eukaryotic cells, as well as being \nfound in some prokaryotic organisms and viruses (Smith and Merrill 2002). \nStudies in mammals and yeast have shown that they are important structural \ncomponents of membranes and also serve as bioactive molecules involved in \ncell signalling and regulation (Dickson, et al. 2006; Fernandis and Wenk 2007; \nHanada, et al. 1992). The unmodified sphingolipid, ceramide, is an \nintermediate in complex sphingolipid biosynthesis in the Golgi apparatus. \nThese complex species ultimately concentrate in the outer leaflet of the \nplasma membrane where, with sterols, they form lipid raft microdomains \n(Futerman and Hannun 2004). Rafts have been proposed to be central to a \nmultitude of cellular processes, from the polarized trafficking of lipid-modified \nproteins (Brown and London 1998) to the formation of signal transduction \ncomplexes (Magee, et al. 2002; Pierce 2002). Furthermore, sphingolipid \nmetabolites such as ceramide and phosphorylated sphingosine (sphingosine-\n1-phosphate), are central to intracellular signal transduction processes that \nregulate cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis (programmed cell death \u2013 \nPCD; Futerman and Hannun 2004). \nThe biosynthesis of sphingolipids shows commonality between mammals, \nfungi and plants up to the formation of ceramide (phytoceramide in plants and \nfungi), but the predominant complex phosphosphingolipid species \nsubsequently synthesized differs. Mammals produce sphingomyelin (SM; a \nceramide unit with a phosphorylcholine moiety), whereas fungi and plants \nsynthesize inositol phosphorylceramide (IPC) by the transfer of the \nphosphorylinositol group from phosphatidylinositol (PI) to phytoceramide, a \nreaction catalysed by IPC synthase. This enzyme was shown to be at least \npartly encoded by the AUR1 gene in yeast and other fungi (Nagiec, et al. \n1997), and recently an accessory protein involved in IPC synthase activity \n(KEI1p) in these organisms has been identified (Sato, et al. 2009). However, \nthe plant enzyme remained unidentified although the activity had been \n 4 \nmeasured in bean microsomes (Bromley, et al. 2003). Then, during a screen \nfor factors involved in PCD defence mechanisms, an AUR1 functional \northologue was identified in Arabidopsis. However, the encoded protein \ndemonstrated little homology to the yeast AUR1p, having most similarity to \nthe more recently identified animal sphingomyelin synthases (Wang, et al. \n2008). This lack of similarity to the long known fungal enzyme (Nagiec, et al. \n1997) lay behind the previously fruitless search for the plant orthologue \n(Dunn, et al. 2004).  \nHere we demonstrate that all three orthologues identifiable in the Arabidopsis \ngenome database represent aureobasidin A resistant functional orthologues \nand that, through phylogenetic analyses, these represent a new group of \nsphingolipid synthases within the wider enzyme family. Furthermore, we show \nthe expression profile of all three isoforms in the tissues of Arabidopsis. This \ndemonstrated that there is differential expression of IPC synthase, an enzyme \ncentral to the synthesis of plasma membrane sphingolipids (Dunn et al. 2004) \nand a regulator of PCD (Wang, et al. 2008) in this plant species. \n 5 \nMaterials and Methods \n \nComplementation of auxotrophic AUR1 mutant yeast with AtIPCS1-3 \nArabidopsis IPC synthase 1, 2 and 3 (AtIPCS1 - At3g54020.1, AtIPCS2 - \nAt2g37940.1 and AtIPCS3 - At2g29525.1) were amplified from Arabidopsis \ncDNA using primers  \n5\u2019 AtIPCS1 EcoRI gaattcATGACGCTTTATATTCGCCGCG and 3\u2019 AtIPCS1 \nSalI gtcgacGAGCAGAGATCTCATGTGCC;  \n5\u2019 AtIPCS2 EcoRI gaattcATGACACTTTATATTCGTCGTG and 3\u2019 AtIPCS2 \nSalI gtcgacTCACGCGCCATTCATTGTG;  \n5\u2019 AtIPCS3 EcoRI gaattcATGCCGGTTTACGTTGATCGCG and 3\u2019 AtIPCS3 \nSalI\u0002gtcgacTCAATGATCATCTGCTACATTG. \nThe products were subsequently cloned into the yeast vector pRS426MET25, \ncreating pRS426 AtIPCS1-3. In the YPH499\u2013HIS\u2013GAL\u2013AUR1 S. cerevisiae \nstrain expression of the essential AUR1 gene (Nagiec, et al. 1997) is under \nthe control of the GAL1 promoter and is repressed in the presence of glucose \n(Denny, et al. 2006). YPH499\u2013HIS\u2013GAL\u2013AUR1 was transformed with \npRS426 AtIPCS1-3 and pRS426 AUR1 and functionally complemented \ntransformants selected on non-permissive SD medium containing necessary \nnutritional supplements (Denny, et al. 2006). \n \nDiffusion assay of complemented auxotrophic AUR1 mutant yeast \nYPH499\u2013HIS\u2013GAL\u2013AUR1 pRS246 AtIPCS1-3 and YPH499\u2013HIS\u2013GAL\u2013AUR1 \npRS246 AUR1 were assayed for susceptibility to aureobasidin A (Takara) and \nmyriocin (Sigma) as previously described (Nagiec, et al. 2003). Briefly, \n2.4x107 logarithmically dividing cells were embedded in 15 ml of YPD-agarose \n(1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose, 0.8% agarose) on 100 mm2 \nsquare Petri dishes (Sarstedt). Inhibitors were applied in Me2SO at the \nconcentrations described below and the dishes incubated at 30\u00b0C. \n \n 6 \nMicrosomal assay of AtIPCS \nFor in vitro assay microsomal membranes were prepared from YPH499\u2013HIS\u2013\nGAL\u2013AUR1 pRS246 AtIPCS1-3 and YPH499\u2013HIS\u2013GAL\u2013AUR1 pRS246 \nAUR1 and assayed as described (Mina, et al. 2009). In brief, assays were \nperformed in 50\u0002l of 100mM Tris HCl pH 7.4, 10mM EDTA and 6mg\/ml \ndefatted BSA, with or without 1mM PI (soybean, Avanti Polar Lipids; \npredominant species C16:0-C18:2) and 5\u0002M aureobsidin A, and with 2 \u0002l of \nmicrosomes (10 mg\/ml protein) and 2\u0002l of 5mM NBD C6-Ceramide (Molecular \nProbes) in DMSO. After incubation at 30\u00b0C for 60 min the reaction was \nstopped by the addition of 150\u0002l of chloroform\/methanol\/water (10:10:3 v\/v\/v) \nand the lipid fraction isolated by phase separation. This process facilitated \nreproducible quantitative analyses of IPC formation. Following equilibriation \n(Synergy HT, Bio-tek) samples were analysed by high performance thin-layer \nchromatography (Denny, et al. 2001; Ralton and McConville 1998), imaged \nusing a FLA3000 scanner (Fuji) and quantified using the Aida V3.11 software \npackage. \n \nPlant growth and harvesting of material \nArabidopsis thaliana (Col-0) plants were grown under long-day conditions (16 \nh day\/8 h night) and the following tissues were harvested at specific \ndevelopment stages (Boyes, et al. 2001). Rosette leaves were collected at \nstage 3.90, cauline leaves and stem were collected at stage 5.10, roots and \nflowers were collected at stage 6.50, siliques were collected at stage 8.00. \n  \nRNA Isolation and RT \nPlant tissue was harvested and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total \nRNA was isolated using an RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen), including DNAse I \ndigestion, according to the manufacturers instructions.  \nRNA integrity was tested by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels and was \nquantified by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm. The A260 nm \u2044 A280 nm ratios \nof purified RNA samples were in the range of 2.0 to 2.1 and were determined \nto be free of genomic DNA by the absence of larger, intron containing, PCR \n 7 \nproducts. \nRT reactions were carried out on 1.0\u0002g of total plant RNA using Superscript III \nreverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and oligo dT primer according to the \nmanufacturers instructions. \n \nReal-Time qRT-PCR conditions and analysis \nSteady-state levels of RNA for each AtIPCS gene in plant material were \nanalysed using SYBR green to monitor DNA synthesis with a Rotor-Gene RG-\n3000 (Corbett Research) instrument. Amplification was achieved with the \nfollowing gene-specific primers; AtIPCS1-forward 5\u2019-\nAGCCTCTTGATTATTGCGTC-3\u2019 and AtIPCS1-reverse 5\u2019-\nAACAACGGCATTGCTCCCT-3\u2019 to give a 145 bp product; AtIPCS2-forward \n5\u2019-AGCCTCTTGATCATTGCCTC-3\u2019 and AtIPCS2-reverse 5\u2019-\nGACTGCTGTGTTGCTCCCA-3\u2019 to produce a 145 bp product; AtIPCS3-\nforward 5\u2019-TGGCTTATGGCAGTAATACAG-3\u2019 and AtIPCS3-reverse 5\u2019-\nGCCAGAAATGGCAGAACGTTCT-3\u2019 to produce a 141 bp product. To \ndetermine the highest specificity and sensitivity qPCR profile for each AtIPCS \ntranscript, titration experiments were performed over a range of MgCl2 \nconcentrations (1.5 to 5 mM) and primer concentrations from (0.1 to 0.5 \u03bcM). \nConcentrations were considered optimal at the lowest CT value that \nreproducibly gave an amplicon of the correct size in the absence of primer \ndimers. Based on results of these optimization experiments, qPCR assays for \nthe AtIPCS1 transcript contained 3 mM MgCl2 and 0.5 \u03bcM of each primer; the \nAtIPCS2 transcript 3 mM MgCl2 and 0.4 \u03bcM of each primer; and the AtIPCS3 \ntranscript 4 mM MgCl2, 0.4 \u03bcM of the forward and 0.5 \u03bcM of the reverse \nprimer. The reactions (total volume 20 \u03bcl) also contained 2 \u03bcl of 10X PCR \nbuffer, 10 pg of cDNA, 200 \u03bcM dNTPs, SYBR Green I dye and 2 Units of Taq \npolymerase. Assays were carried out using the following conditions: 1 cycle of \n10 min of 95oC, followed by 30 cycles of 10 sec of 95 oC, 15 at 52 oC and 20 \nsec of 72 oC. Amplicon dissociation curves were recorded at the end of the \nPCR cycles. External standard curves were constructed using the three \nAtIPCS cDNAs and relevant gene-specific primer pairs and used to determine \nthe number of transcripts for each gene. \n 8 \n \nResults \n \nAtIPCS1-3 complement an AUR1 auxotrophic mutant yeast and confer \naureobasidin A resistance \nInterrogation of the Arabidopsis genome database with the predicted protein \nsequence of the protozoan IPC synthase from Leishmania major (LmIPCS) \n(Denny, et al. 2006) identified opening reading frames encoding three highly \nrelated sequence orthologues  \u2013 Arabidopsis IPC synthase 1 (AtIPCS1 - \nAt3g54020.1), AtIPCS2 (At2g37940.1) and AtIPCS3 (At2g29525.1) \u2013 \ndemonstrating 26%, 29% and 31% identity to the protozoan protein. \nSubsequently, AtIPCS2 has been isolated, characterised and designated \nERH1 (Wang, et al. 2008). The open reading frames of AtIPCS1-3, when \ncloned into an URA3 selectable expression vector to create pRS426 AtIPCS1-\n3, restored the growth of the AUR1 auxotrophic mutant YPH499-HIS-GAL-\nAUR1, as did the ectopic expression of S. cerevisiae AUR1p (AUR1) (figure \n1A). These data indicated that AtIPCS1, 2 and 3 are functional orthologues of \nfungal AUR1p, a protein that forms at least part of an IPC synthase (Nagiec, \net al. 1997).  \nBy diffusion assay (Nagiec, et al. 1997; Nagiec, et al. 2003) the efficacy of two \ndifferent classes of inhibitor were assayed against YPH499-HIS-GAL-AUR1 \npRS426 AtIPCS1, 2 and 3. The transgenic yeast were resistant to \naureobasidin A (AbA, a fungal IPC synthase inhibitor) at 100\u03bcM (figure 1B), a \nconcentration shown to inhibit the growth of LmIPCS complemented yeast \n(Denny, et al. 2006), but remained sensitive to myriocin (which inhibits the first \nstep in sphingolipid biosynthesis - serine palmitoyltransferase, SPT). Indeed, \nyeast complemented with the plant enzymes appeared to be more sensitive to \nthe SPT inhibitor than the AUR1 control, a similar observation had previously \nbeen made with regard to the LmIPCS complemented yeast (Denny, et al. \n2006). The in vitro assay for AtIPCS1-3 described below (figure 2A) confirmed \nthat the Arabidopsis enzymes are AbA insensitive. In contrast, the IPCS \nactivity from Golden butterwax bean extracts has been shown to be acutely \n 9 \nsensitive to this inhibitor (Bromley, et al. 2003). The reasons for this difference \nin AbA sensitivity are unclear and no data are currently available, for the bean \nsequence, to help elucidate this discrepancy.  \n \nAtIPCS1-3 are functional IPC synthases \nIn vitro assay of microsomes prepared from YPH499-HIS-GAL-AUR1 pRS426 \nAtIPCS1-3 demonstrated that the three plant enzymes are active IPC \nsynthases (figure 2A). However, their turnover appeared low when compared \nto an S. cerevisiae AUR1 control. This was also noted by Wang et al (2008) \nand was unaffected by the use of NBD C6-phytoceramide rather than C6-\nceramide as acceptor substrate. In support of the data shown above (figure \n1B), AtIPCS1-3 activity was insensitive to the addition of AbA at a \nconcentration (5 \u0002M) that completely inhibited the yeast enzyme (figure 2A). \nThereafter this inhibitor was applied to the reaction mix for assay of AtIPCS1-\n3 at 5 \u0002M.  \nIn the experiment (figure 2A) above the plant (and yeast) enzymes are \nassayed in the presence of exogenous soybean PI. To ascertain the effect of \nadding this exogenous donor substrate samples were assayed with and \nwithout PI in the reaction mix (figure 2B). All samples showed a similar level of \nactivity in the absence of donor substrate but, surprisingly, only AtIPCS2 \ndemonstrated any significant increase in turnover on the addition of PI. This \nindicated that the AtIPCS1 and 3 are unable to utilize substrate from this \nsource effectively. Similar results were obtained utilizing bovine PI which has \npreviously been demonstrated to be effectively utilized by the protozoan \northologues from both L. major and Trypanosoma brucei but not by S. \ncerevisiae AUR1p (Mina, et al. 2009). Despite this, these data confirm \nAtIPCS1-3 as functional orthologues of AUR1p, forming at least part of an IPC \nsynthase.  \n \n 10 \nThe plant IPC synthases form a new class of sphingolipid synthase \nThe key motifs, D3 and D4, of the sphingolipid synthase family are conserved \nin the plant IPC synthases (Wang, et al. 2008). However, unlike their \nprotozoan and mammalian counterparts they lack a D1 domain  (Huitema, et \nal. 2004). In this they resemble the fungal IPC synthases and it may be \nhypothesized that D1 is involved in the binding of ceramide, a substrate for \nthe protozoan and mammalian enzymes, whereas another unidentified region \nis involved in binding the phytoceramide substrate to the plant and fungal IPC \nsynthases. Despite the conservation of some of these motifs the plant \nsequences are divergent with respect to primary sequence and so, until \nrecently, remained cryptic within the genome databases (Wang, et al. 2008). \nThis divergence was illustrated by phylogenetic analysis of predicted SM and \nIPC synthase sequences which demonstrated that the plant enzymes, the \nthree orthologues identified in the Oryza sativa (rice) database are included, \nform a new clade of sphingolipid synthases (figure 3). \n \nExpression profiling of AtIPCS1-3 \nEstimates of the relative abundance of transcripts can be made from their \nrepresentation within the EST databases. For the three AtIPCS genes \ndescribed a similar number of AtIPCS1 and AtIPCS3 transcripts are present, \nwhilst the largest number is for AtIPCS2 (Table 1; data derived from TAIR \nBLAST version 2.2.8). However, these data do not give any information \nregarding the tissue location of the transcripts and are therefore of limited use \nwhen investigating the expression of gene families. Tissue-specific transcript \nabundance data can be obtained from multiple microarray experiments using \nGenevestigator (Grennan 2006). Only AtIPCS2 is represented on the \nAffymetrix arrays that are used to derive these data and this shows that the \ngene is expressed in cauline leaves, roots and rosette leaves at similar levels \nand these are approximately twice the expression levels seen in stems, \nflowers and siliques (Table 2).  \nGiven the limitations of these data sets, in order to establish a complete \nexpression profile for each AtIPCS isoform, real time quantitative RT-PCR \nwas performed on RNA isolated from various Arabidopsis tissues (figure 4). \n 11 \nAtIPCS2 was the most highly expressed of the three isoforms in all tissues. In \nagreement with the Genevestigator data, the highest levels of AtIPCS2 \ntranscript were seen in root, rosette leaves and cauline leaves and these were \nfive to ten fold greater than the levels of transcripts in siliques, stems and \nflowers. The patterns of expression determined by these two methods are in \ngeneral agreement but the relative levels differ, this may reflect differences in \nthe plant material used in the each case. Genevestigator uses a large number \nof microarray experiments to generate data and is therefore robust, however \nthe data represents plant material grown under different conditions and which \nmay have been harvested at different times within a developmental stage. \nThe quantitative RT-PCR data presented here is determined from plants \ngrown and harvested under identical conditions and therefore represents \ntranscript levels at defined developmental stages in these tissues. \nAtIPCS1 transcripts are expressed at low levels in all tissues, ranging from \n0.05% of AtIPCS2 levels in rosette leaves to 2.8% of AtIPCS2 levels in stems. \nWhile AtIPCS3 transcripts are also present in low levels in cauline leaves, \nrosette leaves, roots and stems (ranging from 0.02% to 0.67% of AtIPCS2 \ntranscripts) they are present at similar levels to AtIPCS2 transcripts in stem \n(84 % of AtIPCS2 levels) and flower (74% of AtIPCS2 levels).  \nThe data presented here adds to existing studies by providing tissue specific \nexpression data for all the isoforms of AtIPCS which may indicate a specific \nrole for AtIPCS3 in stems and flowers. \n \n \n 12 \nDiscussion \n \nThe data presented describe the analyses of all three orthologues of the \nrecently identified Arabidopsis IPC synthase (Wang, et al. 2008). They all \nrepresented functional orthologues of S. cerevisiae IPC synthase, AUR1p, \nand demonstrated activity in an in vitro assay. However, unlike the yeast \nactivity the Arabidopsis enzyme is resistant to aureobasidin A, a non-\ncompetive inhibitor of the fungal IPC synthase with an unknown mechanism of \naction (Zhong, et al. 1999). Conversely, it has previously been shown that the \nIPCS activity in Golden butterwax bean extracts was acutely sensitive to this \ninhibitor (Bromley, et al. 2003). The reasons for this discrepancy are unclear, \nhowever it is notable that similarly profound differences in aureobasidin A \nsensitivity have been observed within the kinetoplastid parasite IPCS \northologues. Whilst the L. major enzyme is relatively refractory to the drug, the \nT. brucei sphingolipid synthase (TbSLS) is highly sensitive (Mina, et al. 2009). \nNo reason for this can be deduced from the primary sequence data and it may \nbe envisaged that this diversity is due to subtle differences in 3-dimensional \nenzyme structure.  \nIn the in vitro, microsome-based assay all three Arabidopsis isoforms \ndemonstrated IPC synthase turnover. However, although the presence of PI \n(from soybean or bovine sources) led to a significant increase in turnover with \nAtIPCS2, AtIPCS1 and 3 were refractory to the addition of this donor \nsubstrate. This indicated that PI from these sources was utilized inefficiently \nby these Arabidopsis isoforms. Similarly, it has been noted that mammalian PI \nis not efficiently utilized by the S. cerevisiae IPC synthase activity (Mina, et al. \n2009).  Notably, unlike the yeast phospholipids (Guan and Wenk 2006), plant \nand mammalian PIs exhibit varying degrees of polyunsaturation (Thompson \nand MacDonald 1975; Thompson and MacDonald 1976). It may be \nhypothesized this polyunstauration may confer structural constraints and \nmake it less acceptable to the S. cerevisiae enzyme. However, the lack of \nreactivity of AtIPCS1 and with plant derived PI (soybean, C16:0-C18:2) is less \neasy to explain. It is possible that the endogenous yeast PI has a higher \naffinity for these isoforms and outcompetes the exogenous substrate. \n 13 \nAttempts to minimize the available quantity of endogenous PI to test this were \nmade by detergent washing as previously (Mina, et al. 2009). However, this \nled to apparent inactivation of the enzymes. Alternatively, significant \ndifferences may exist in the substrate requirements of these Arabidopsis \nisoforms. Notably, AtIPCS1 transcript level is low in all plant tissue and \nAtIPCS3 in many, including siliques, perhaps reflecting the level of acceptable \ndonor PI in seeds (such as soybeans, the source of PI in these experiments). \nDespite these variances, all the plant IPC synthase orthologues identified \nshare the motifs predicted to form the catalytic triad that promotes nucleophilic \nattack on lipid phosphate ester bonds which, in the case of IPC synthase, is \nthought to lead to the transfer of an inositol phosphate group from PI to the 1-\nhydroxyl group of (phyto)ceramide releasing diacylglycerol as a by-product \n(Huitema, et al. 2004; Neuwald 1997). Therefore it is likely that the eukaryotic \nsphingolipid synthases possess a common mechanism of action, indicating a \nsingle evolutionary origin. In contrast, the prokaryotic SM synthase lacks the \ncatalytic triad (Luberto, et al. 2003) and is likely to have evolved \nindependently. Phylogenetic analyses show the plant proteins forming a \ndistinct clade, thereby defining a new class of eukaryotic sphingolipid \nsynthases. \nIt has been demonstrated, by RNAi of the first enzyme in the biosynthetic \npathway - serine palmitoyltransferase, that sphingolipid biosynthesis per se is \nessential for the viability of Arabidopsis (Chen, et al. 2006). Furthermore, \nrecent work has suggested that the plant IPC synthase is pivotal in pathogen-\nresistance associated PCD. By analyses of leaf tissue from an ERH1 \n(AtIPCS2) insertion mutant Wang et al (2008) detected a significant increase \nin ceramide levels, an observation consistent with the fact that ceramide is a \nsubstrate for IPCS. Importantly, ceramide is a key regulator of PCD \n(Futerman and Hannun 2004) and the accumulation of this factor was co-\nincident with PCD at the site of powdery mildew infection in Arabidopsis \n(Wang, et al. 2008). This work is further supported by similar observations in \naccelerated-cell-death (acd11 and acd5) mutants of Arabidopsis in which a \nsphingosine transfer protein (ACD11) or a ceramide kinase (ACD5) are \naffected (Brodersen, et al. 2002; Liang, et al. 2003). Given the prominence of \n 14 \nAtIPCS2 as a putative regular of PCD the differential expression levels of \neach of the three functional Arabidopsis orthologues may shed light on this \nkey process in the whole plant. \n 15 \nAcknowledgements \nThis work was funded by Biotechnology and Biological Research Council \n(BB\/D52396X\/1) and Royal Society (2005\/R1) grants to PWD and a British \nCouncil\/Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst Academic Research \nCollaboration Award to PWD and RTS.
