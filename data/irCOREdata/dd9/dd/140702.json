INTRODUCTION\nThis paper is concerned with finding the optimum\nparameters for efficient grinding without causing surface\ndamage to the work piece. Specifically, it is to\nsimultaneously minimise the surface temperature and\ngrinding energy involved in the high efficiency deep\ngrinding process (HEDG).\nThe paper consists of several sections. Section 2 describes\nthe high efficiency deep grinding process. Section 3 is a\nconcise overview of the main research in the area of fuzzy\nexpert systems and multi objective optimisation. Section\n4 outlines the proposed approach for this project. Section\n5 gives results. These are then discussed in section 6.\nLimitations and future work are in section 7. The paper\nconcludes in section 8 followed by references in section 9.\n2 HIGH EFFICIENCY DEEP GRINDING\nHEDG is a relatively new machining regime. It has been\nsuccessfully applied in industry to achieve very high\nremoval rates and good work piece surface integrity.\nTypical applications of HEDG include grinding of deep\nslots or grooves or simply removing a thick layer of\nmaterial from the workpiece surface [6].\nIn traditional grinding, increases in depth of cut, feed rate\nand wheel speed cause increases in surface temperature.\nHowever it has been found that a dramatic increase in\ndepth of cut and feed rate accompanied by an increase in\nwheel speed give lower than previously expected\ntemperature. HEDG relative to conventional grinding,\nwith respect to removal rate and temperature, is shown in\nfigure 1.0. The wheel is in contact with the workpiece for\nless time. Thus reducing the amount of heat transferred to\nthe finished product [12].\nFigure 1.0 Temperature against removal rate\nThe unique heat transfer conditions can cause thermal\ndamage to the workpiece surface. The aim of this project\nis to choose the appropriate grinding parameters to realise\nefficient grinding without any thermal damage to the work\npiece.\nThe contact temperature can be calculated by predicting\nthe various heat flux values. Rowe [9] gives the equation\nfor total heat flux in the HEDG process as\nfchswt qqqqq \uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf03d\nwhere qt is the total heat flux, qw is the heat flux into\nthe work piece, qs is the heat flux into the wheel, qch is the\nheat flux into the removed chips and qf is the heat flux\ninto the coolant fluid. This is depicted in figure 2.0.\nSpecific Volume of Material Removed\nWorkpiece\nSurface\nTemp\nConventional\nGrinding\nHEDG\nInfeasible \u2013\ntemp too high\nThe decision variables are the width of cut, feed rate,\ndepth of cut and wheel speed. The objective is to\nminimise the surface temperature and the specific grinding\nenergy. The specific grinding energy is equivalent to the\npower consumed per unit volume of material removed.\nAnalytical models have been put forward that predict the\nsurface temperature of the work piece. These methods are\nderived from partial differential equations concerning the\nheat dissipation in and around the contact area [7].\nThe data used for this study relates to M50 hardened\nbearing steel. This is used in the aerospace and\nautomotive industry. Specific surface finish is required.\nAny machine damage introduced during processing can\ncause rapid deterioration during use [11].\nHEDG is a new process with some proposed theories and\nanalytical models, the technician\u2019s expert opinion and a\nlimited amount of empirical data. The challenge is to\ndevelop a model that can incorporate all three knowledge\nsources to describe the process and allow optimisation.\n3 LITERATURE REVIEW\nA Fuzzy Expert Systems\nLukasiewicz first developed a system of logic that\nextended the truth values to all real numbers in the range 0\nto 1. He used a number in this set to represent the\npossibility that a given statement was true or false. This\nresearch led to a formal inexact reasoning technique aptly\nnamed possibility theory.\nIn 1965, Zadeh extended the work on possibility theory\ninto a formal system of mathematical logic. Zadeh also\npromoted fuzzy concepts and logic to the engineering and\nscientific community. These concepts are collectively\nreferred to as fuzzy logic [3].\nA Fuzzy Expert System (FES) comprises of three\noperations. First inputs are fuzzified. This converts\nnumerical inputs into a set of degree of membership\nvalues. The second stage is inferencing here relevant rules\nare formed. Finally the consequent sets are defuzzified to\ngive a crisp numeric output.\nThe knowledge required for a FES creation is in two\ndistinct forms. Firstly, membership functions for all input\nand output variables. An example set of membership\nfunctions is shown in figure 2.0. Secondly, a rule base\nthat relates input variables (antecedents) to output\nvariables is required. This is simply a list of if\u2026then\u2026\nrules. For example\nIf DOC is LARGE and FEED is HIGH then\nTEMP is V. HIGH\nIf WIDTH is LOW and WHLSPD is FAST\nthen SGE is MEDIUM\nThese two components are combined with the\nfuzzification, inferencing, and defuzzification methods to\nproduce a complete FES.\nFigure 3.0 Membership functions from the FES\nB. Multi Objective Optimisation\nSince the pioneering work of Schaffer in 1985 [10] multi-\nobjective genetic algorithms have been attracting\nincreased interest. These algorithms seem particularly\nsuited to this task. They process a set of solutions, the\npopulation, in parallel. This naturally allows them to\ngenerate a set of solutions approximating the pareto front.\nSchaffer developed the Vector Evaluated Genetic\nAlgorithm (VEGA). This worked by creating sections or\nsub-populations in the next generation. Each sub-\npopulation would select its parents according to one of the\nobjectives. The whole population was then shuffled and\ncrossover and mutation applied. This is known as a\npopulation based non-pareto approach.\nMulti objective optimisation problems can prove very\ndifficult. Objectives can be conflicting and incomparable.\nThis prohibits the use of aggregation methods. In these\ncases a single optimum cannot be identified. Instead a set\nof non- dominated or efficient solutions are required.\nThese are also known as the pareto optimal set. In\nminimisation problems the pareto set can be defined by:\nFigure 2.0 Schematic of Heat Flux in HEDG\nqw\nqch\nqs qf\nworkpiece\ngrinding\nwheel\nFigure 4.0 Surface Temperature\nDefinition 1 (Pareto Dominance) A vector u ={u1, u2,\nu3,\u2026, up} is said to dominate v={v1,v2,v3,\u2026,vp} if and\nonly if u is partially less than v.\uf022 i e {1,2,\u2026,p},ui \uf0a3 vi\nand \uf024 I e {1,2,\u2026,p} ui<vi.\nDefinition 2 (Pareto Optimality) A solution xu e U is said\nto be pareto optimal if and only if there exist no xv e U for\nwhich v=F(xv) = {v1,v2,v3,\u2026,v4} dominates\nu=f(xu)={u1,u2,u3,\u2026,up}.\nPareto based fitness assignment was first proposed by\nGoldberg [5]. The idea is to assign equal probability of\nreproduction to all non-dominated individuals in the\npopulation. It is also possible to rank the whole\npopulation according to how close it is to being non-\ndominated and assign each rank a fitness value.\nA similar scheme was proposed by Fonseca and Fleming\n[4], where each individual\u2019s fitness is calculated according\nto the number of individuals that dominate it. The more\nindividuals that dominate a solution the lower that\nsolution\u2019s fitness becomes.\nMore recently several new algorithms have been\ndeveloped such as the Strength Pareto Evolutionary\nAlgorithm (SPEA) [14] and Fast Elitist Non-dominated\nSorting GA (NSGA-II) 21].\nIt has been observed that elitist GA\u2019s with pareto\ndomination and diversity preserving operators achieve\nsuperior results[13].\nIn this study NSGA-II and SPEA algorithms will be\napplied to the problem.\n4. PROPOSED APPROACH\nThe approach proposed in this paper is as follows. First\nthe HEDG process is modelled using a fuzzy expert\nsystem. This model is then used as the fitness function in\nMulti objective evolutionary optimisation.\nA. Fuzzy Fitness Function\nA fuzzy expert system (FES) was created. The\nmembership functions and rule base were developed using\nexpert knowledge. A diagram showing the decision\nvariables and objectives with respect to the FES is shown\nin figure 6.0. The knowledge was elicited through the use\nof structure interview techniques [3].\nEmpirical data was used to calibrate the model. The FES\nmapped the decision variables onto the objective function.\nIt can be used as fitness function in an evolutionary\nalgorithm.\nThe response surface for the surface temperature objective\nwith respect to decision variables feed rate and depth of\ncut is shown in figure 4.0\nFigure 5.0 Specific Grinding Energy\nAbove, in figure 5.0, is the response surface for specific\ngrinding energy with depth of cut and feed rate being the\ndecision variables.\nFigure 6.0 Schematic of fuzzy expert system\nB Constraints\nIn Grinding the material is removed by the abrasive. It is\nthen present in the gap or spaces between abrasives at the\nwheel\u2019s surface. The more gaps there are the greater the\nvolume of space for chip removal. This parameter is\nknown as the porosity of the wheel.\nIf the material removal per unit length of the wheel is\nhigher than this porosity level material cannot be removed\neffectively. This constitutes a process constraint. In this\nstudy we shall model this constraint as a third objective.\nIn this way infeasible solutions are valid during evolution.\nHowever feasible solutions will dominate infeasible\nsolutions and thus few if any infeasible solutions will\nremain in the end population. This depends on how the\nobjectives conflict. In a situation where several\nconstraints are present they can be easily aggregated into\none objective using a fuzzy expert system. This would\nrepresent the overall infeasibility of the solution.\nIn this study a value for material removed\/wheel speed\nabove 34 is infeasible. This was modelled using a fuzzy\nsystem. A membership function that has a degree of\nmember ship equal to zero for values below 34 and\nconstantly rises above this was used. A rule relating this\nto a consequent fuzzy set named infeasible was created.\nThis set had a degree of membership value of zero at zero\nand grows proportionally greater as the value is increase.\nFES\nWidth\nof Cut\nFeed\nRate\nDeptth\nof Cut\nWheel\nSpeed\nSRR\nConstrain\nt\nSGE\nTemp\nFigure 6.0 Output for fuzzy constraint objective\nA plot showing the relationship between the constraint\nvalue and the degree of membership to the infeasible set is\nshown in figure 6.0. Extra constraints could easily be\nadded. The fuzzy expert system allows the aggregation of\nseveral constraints to form one objective regarding the\noverall infeasibility of the solution.\nWhen using floating point encoding is real numbers are\nrecombined at a point P. The number P \uf020is randomly \ngenerated in the interval [0, 1]. For two real number x and\ny the two offspring can be defined as\nx\u2019 = P*x +(1- P)y\ny\u2019 = P*y +(1-P)x\nThis means that new offspring formed by recombination\nalways lie in between the parent values for each decision\nvariable. Recombination in this manner is much more\nexploitative and less explorative when compared with\nbinary crossover techniques. Real encoded GA\u2019s are\ntotally reliant on mutation for exploration beyond current\npopulation boundaries.\nIt is hypothesised that allowing infeasible solutions to be\nincluded in the evolutionary process will give faster and\nrepeatable convergence to the pareto front. Fuzzy\nconstraints allow the inclusion of infeasible solutions.\nC Search Space\nA quasi exhaustive search was carried out for this study to\ndetermine the nature of the search space. This is purely\nfor academic reason and would not be necessary in\nindustrial practice. It allows a qualitative evaluation of the\nnature of the search to be formed. It also allows the\neffectiveness of the MOEAs to be assessed. This plot\nonly contains a fraction of the possible solutions. The plot\ncontains 104 points. The experiments were run using\nMatlab. Floating point numbers were to 15 significant\nfigures. There are four decision variables hence total\nsearch space size of approximately 10(15+4) points.\nFigure 8.0 shows a scatter plot of the values for the two\nmain objectives; surface temperature and specific grinding\nenergy.\nInfeasible solutions are included in this plot. Although\ndifficult to see at this resolution figure 9.0 shows that the\ninfeasible solutions can be detected near the pareto\noptimal front.\nFigure 10.0 shows the SPEA algorithm run with the 3rd\nobjective measuring solution infeasibility included. The\ndark points represent feasible solutions. As the points\nfade they become more and more infeasible. This plot\nclearly shows that infeasible regions lie adjacent to the\npareto front. Allowing infeasible solutions to be included\nin the evolutionary process gives a more rapid and reliable\nconvergence to the pareto front.\nFigure 7.0 Quasi exhaustive search\n5 RESULTS FROM OPTIMISATION\nTwo multi objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEA)\nwere applied. NSGA and SPEA were chosen as two of\nthe more highly regarded algorithms in the literature. The\nparameters set as shown in table 1.0.\nFigure 11.0 \u2013 15.0 plot the results. The final population\nfrom the NSGA-II is represented by crosses. The archived\nset from the SPEA is represented by filled circles. Only\nfeasible solutions are plotted.\nNSGA produce a near optimum pareto front with good\ndiversification in all cases. SPEA\u2019s results are inferior but\nstill competitive except in the first case. With a limited\nnumber of generations, 10 in this case, SPEA finds points\ncloser to the optimum point that NSGA-II.\nSPEA only retains non dominated solutions in the archive.\nIt is in effect much more selective about which candidates\nit favours. This effect is only apparent before the archive\nreaches its maximum. The SPEA quickly approximates\nthe pareto front but does not retain diversity as effectively.\nInstead it relies on the fitness assignment and crowding\nfactor to diversify.\nThe NSGA algorithm is slower at converging towards\nthe front but given time produces a more diverse estimate\nthat is closer to the real front.\nFigure 8.0 Infeasible values close to pareto front\nFigure 9.0 SPEA using solution feasibility as third objective\nFigure 10.0 NSGA and SPEA pareto front estimatations Figure 13.0 NSGA and SPEA pareto front estimatations\nFigure 11.0 NSGA and SPEA pareto front estimatations\nFigure 12.0 NSGA and SPEA pareto front estimatations\nFigure 14.0 NSGA and SPEA pareto front estimatations\nTable 1.0 Parameters for algorithm experiments\nFig Pop Arch Xover Mutate Genera\ntion\n1 50 50 0.8 0.2 10\n50 - 0.8 0.2 10\n2 50 50 0.8 0.2 30\n50 - 0.8 0.2 30\n4 50 50 0.8 0.2 100\n50 - 0.8 0.2 100\n4 50 50 0.8 0.4 30\n50 - 0.8 0.4 30\n5 50 50 0.5 0.2 30\n50 - 0.5 0.2 30\n6 DISCUSSION\nIn many cases MOEA can effectively estimate the\npareto front with a high proximity. They can often find\nit difficult to converge exactly onto the front. One\nreason for this could be the use of real encoding when\nthe solution lies on one or more boundary constraints.\nIf infeasible solutions are not allowed in the\nevolutionary process a real encoded GA is relying on\neither a member of the initial population or a mutation\nto create an individual on this pareto front.\nThe use of fuzzy constraints as an objective allows\ninfeasible solutions to take part in the evolution of the\npareto front. This increases the likelihood of the pareto\nfront lying between points included in the initial\npopulation.\nThe experiments showed how NSGA outperforms\nSPEA under all conditions when applied to this problem.\nThe only exception is with a low number of\ngenerations. Here SPEA convergence to the pareto\nfront is quick whilst its diversity is inferior\n.\n8 LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH\nThis paper has shown that using fuzzy expert systems\nas fitness functions in evolutionary optimisation is a\nvalid and effective approach. It also shows that\nmodelling constraints as part of the fuzzy system is\npossible. Research into the advantages of using this\ntechnique compared to alternatives is needed.\nTypically a fuzzy model take longer than a\nmathematical equation to evaluate. In the literature,\nwhen comparing multi objective algorithms the number\nof sorts required has been used to evaluate an\nalgorithm\u2019s complexity and thus the time required for\noperation. When using fuzzy models, or indeed any\nfitness function with a relatively long evaluation time\nthe number of sorts becomes less important. The\nnumber of evaluations is significant. Research into a\nMOEA specifically aimed at operating with long fitness\nfunction evalution times is needed. This would put less\nemphasis on archive size and number of sort and more\non number of evaluations. This could come in the form\nof an algorithm that combines memory methods (tabu\nsearch etc) with evolutionary methods. More research\nis needed in this area.\nSPEA outperforms NSGA for the first few generations.\nResearch is required to determine if this is the case ifor\nthe majority of problems. If so can an algorithm be\ndeveloped that combines the strong points of each\nmethod.\n7. CONCLUSIONS\nThis paper has applied fuzzy based modelling\ntechniques to the HEDG process and created a\nmeaningful model. It has also shown how constraints\ncan be modelled as fuzzy objectives. The greater the\ndegree to which a solution breaks constraints the higher\nits degree of membership to the set \u2018infeasible\u2019 becomes.\nThe paper has successfully applied two of the leading\nMOEA to the problems. This proves that fuzzy\nmodelling, and evolutionary algorithms are effect\ntechniques in the optimisation of industrial processes.\nMore research is needed in this area. In particular a\ncomparison of MOEA using fuzzy constraints against\nother constraint modelling techniques is required.\n8. REFERENCES\n1. Bhuvaneshwaran, V. and Langari, R.
