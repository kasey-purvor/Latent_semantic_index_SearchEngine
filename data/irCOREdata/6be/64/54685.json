Further insights into the merits of the proposed solution are included, along with \nrepresentative results from a prototype system.  \nIntroduction \nThe advent of the more-electric aircraft has initiated significant research into the impact of on-board \npower quality requirements, with key emphasis on systems that must accommodate high power \ntransient demands and noise\/quality sensitive loads, such as those characteristic of actuation systems.  \nMoreover, voltage and current distortion increases network electrical stresses and reduces generation \nefficiency, requiring excessive peak-to-mean electrical ratings of components, and reduced overall \nmass density\u2014a premium constraint for aerospace solutions.   \n \nPower quality indicators have been considered in [1-4], and can be measured using various metrics.  \nHere, power factor and relative harmonic magnitudes will be specifically considered.  Although total \nharmonic distortion (THD) is a well-recognised power quality indicator, it is not considered here since \nthe contribution of individual harmonics is of key importance. \n \nFor industrial applications, the commonly used specification (IEEE 519-1992) [1] defines allowable \nharmonic magnitudes.  However, for aerospace applications there is no such dominant specification.  \nThree have been considered for this paper [2,3,4] that differ in how the maximum harmonic currents \nare defined.  In [2], the harmonics are defined with respect to the present fundamental current.  In [3], \nthe harmonics are defined with respect to the full load current.  The difference between [2] and [3] is \nthat the loads in [3] are variable where as in [2] the loads are expected to operate at a constant \npower\u2014there is therefore no requirement to use full load current in the definition.  In [4], the \nharmonic load is defined in terms of the voltage distortion that it will produce.  The maximum \nharmonic currents for a load will be dependent on the supply impedance.  This will vary with position \non the ac bus bar and with the state of the power network. The number and size of the loads connected \nto the power network will also have an affect on the harmonic currents that a single load may draw.  \nThis degree of freedom in the harmonic limits makes [4] unsuitable for developing single loads, where \nin-depth knowledge of the entire power network and its load profiles are unknown.  It will increase in \nimportance as the system characteristics are defined, and as individual elements are coupled together. \n    \nMajor differences between aerospace systems and traditional industry applications are the frequency \nand the level of the supply.  For industry, the commonly used specification (IEEE 519-1992) allows \nharmonic currents to be drawn in an attenuated 6-pulse shape [1].  That is, the 5th and 7th are the largest \nand, with increasing harmonic number, the allowed magnitude decreases.  A similar shape is defined \nby [3,4], but with different harmonic magnitudes.  In [2], standard converters are expected to provide a \n12-pulse waveshape for equipment with ratings below 5kVA, and 18-pulse for equipment above \n5kVA.  The harmonic current that can be drawn is defined with respect to the level of the fundamental, \nhence, harmonic limits are defined as a relative percentage.   \n \nIn the absence of a definitive harmonic standard, [2] is used by virtue of providing the most stringent \nlow-order harmonic limits (that are the most difficult to attenuate).  Harmonic limits for aerospace \nsystems are developed, generally, for constant load systems, such as those for fans or pumps.  Here, \nhowever, a variable speed actuator for flight control surfaces, is considered\u2014the load profile thus \nbeing predominantly of low holding power, with infrequent high deployment power transients.  The \nsystem must therefore react quickly to changes in load, but also have a suitable harmonic content over \nthe whole load range.  This is particularly important with the prospect of using multiple, distributed, \nsmall-scale electric actuators in place of single large-scale hydraulic counterparts, whereby the \nmultiple loads may draw a distorted current with a relatively small resultant fundamental resulting in \nfailure to meet quality requirements.  In the current absence of published limits of harmonic content \nlevels over a range of load conditions, the harmonic limits will be calculated with respect to the full \nload currents.   \nChoice of active solution \nVarious active solutions for reducing harmonic levels have been investigated and previously reported \n[5,6].  To aid assessment of the various solutions, similar technologies are grouped together.  The first \nsub-division is conveniently drawn between active filters and active rectifiers\u2014the former being used \nto attenuate already existing harmonic currents, whilst the latter are designed to draw currents with \nlow harmonic distortion.  Here, active filters are considered due to their suitability for retrofitting to \nexisting systems.  The primary advantage of active filter solutions is that the current drawn can be \nactively controlled to be predominantly sinusoidal from a distorted supply, thereby reducing the total \nsupply harmonic level with respect to the fundamental.  A relative disadvantage, however, is that the \nrequired switching frequency of the inverter is high due to the requirement for countering the \nharmonics.  \n  \nActive filters can be sub-divided into two broad categories; series and shunt, with the choice often \nbeing dictated by the expected load characteristics [7].  If a voltage source load is present, a series \nactive filter is preferred, whilst a shunt active filter is considered appropriate for current source loads.  \nFor this reason, series active filters are considered the most appropriate technology here.  A variant of \nthe traditional series active filter is an integrated series active filter with a double series diode rectifier \n[8].  The component count in this case is reduced by combining the active filter\u2019s and the main \nrectifier\u2019s dc links, removing the requirement of a separate low power rectifier to charge the active \nfilter dc-link, and reducing the number of dc-link capacitors.  The circuit contains a 12-pulse \ntransformer rectifier unit (TRU) rather than the standard 6-pulse diode rectifier.  The 12-pulse TRU \neliminates the 5th and the 7th harmonic currents from the supply.  With the two lowest order, and \ntypically dominant, harmonics, sufficiently reduced, the active filter demands are significantly \nlowered.   \n \nHere, the proposed circuit includes a standard 6-pulse diode rectifier, since the inline star-delta \ntransformer of a 12-pulse solution, will necessarily increase the size and weight of the overall system.  \nThe disadvantage of the proposed circuit is that the active filter will have to be rated at a higher level \nin comparison to the 12-pulse solution. \n  \nIntegrated series active filter circuit \nThe proposed solution consists of a three-phase integrated series active filter with 6-pulse diode \nrectifier, constructed from 3\u00d7 H-bridge converters, controlled by 20kHz pulse width modulation \n(PWM).  The supply network is at a fixed frequency of 400Hz, with a line impedance of 24\u00b5H and a \nresistance of 6m\u2126.  The dc-link has a 1500\u00b5F capacitor\u2014the load is up to 5kW.  To reduce the impact \nof high-frequency PWM, an LC low pass filter is included on the output of each H-bridge.  A block \ndiagram of the system is given in Fig. 1. \n \n \n \nFig. 1: Model of the integrated series active filter with 6-pulse diode rectifier. \n \nThe active filter is controlled by the dq-harmonic extraction method.  A block diagram of the control \nmethod is shown in Fig. 2.  Once the signal is transformed into the dq reference frame a low pass filter \nis used to obtain the fundamental current component.  When the dc component is transformed back \ninto the normal abc domain it can be subtracted from the original signal to leave the harmonic \ncomponents.   \n \nFig. 2: DQ method control diagram. \n \nAs stated in [9], delay in the control circuit can cause system instability.  To minimise delays in the \npractical solution, the number of clock cycles that occur between the current signal being read and the \nPWM control signal being output, needs to be as low as possible.  This is facilitated by use of the \ncontrol method described previously (low pass filtering) rather than obtaining the harmonic content by \nhigh-pass filtering in the dq domain.  Although the two methods ultimately result in the same output, \nthe high-pass filter method requires two transformations, and a filtering operation, incurring further \nphase shift to obtain the harmonic signals.  Here then, the proposed method obtains the harmonic \nsignals by one set of subtractions.  Any delays that are incurred during the fundamental extraction will \nbe minimal compared to the period of the signal, so they have minimal effect on the operation of the \ncontrol.   \n \nA further advantage of the proposed dq transform technique, as opposed to the traditional band pass \nfilter approach, is that it can be readily extended for use with variable frequency supplies\u2014a feature \nlikely to be incorporated into future electric aircraft generation systems, and one which cannot be \nreadily accommodated by passive, or other active filter solutions. \n \nThe required voltage to attenuate harmonic currents is less than the maximum achievable from the \nactive filter inverters, enabling the matching transformers to be of step-down type, as seen from the \nperspective of the active filter.  A step-down transformer has the advantage that the active filter can be \nrated for a lower current. Moreover, parasitic voltages at the active filter side will be reduced when \nreferred to the line side.  The turns ratio that is used is 1:1.25, enabling the use of relatively high gains \nto attenuate the supply harmonics. \n   \nDC link voltage control \nInitial simulation studies indicated that, due to fundamental voltage drops across the active filter, the \nresulting dc link voltage would be lower than desired.  To counteract this effect, an additional control \nloop is included\u2014see Fig. 4.  The voltage drop over each transformer is measured the fundamental \ncomponent is extracted using a low pass filter in the dq domain.  The signal is then scaled and added \nto the current compensation control signal. \n \nFig. 4: DQ method with voltage and current compensation control diagram. \n \nThe active filter generates an \u2018in-phase\u2019 fundamental voltage, that aids the fundamental current.  The \neffect of the voltage compensation is to increase the dc link voltage from 190V to 250V in this case, \nFig. 5.  It should be noted that this method is only of limited effectiveness, however, due to the \nincreased load presented by the compensation system. \n \nFor the favoured PM brushless machines that are designed for control flight surface actuators, reduced \nweight is a key issue, and often results in high-speed solutions with low phase inductance. For such \nsystems, high dc-link voltages can cause current control stability problems, and, indeed, in some \ncircumstances, can prevent starting on full-load, due to the high peak-to-mean current ripple. Control \nof the dc-link voltage, to a lower value at low speeds may therefore be a valuable consideration, and \none which this topology of converter may provide a solution. \n \nFig. 5: dc link voltages with and with out voltage compensation. \n \nSimulation results \nThe simulations were conducted at 1-and 5-kW loads to confirm the suitability of operation of the \nproposed solution at low (holding) and at high (deployment) loads.  It can be seen from Fig.6 that the \nfull load current spectrum satisfies the harmonic limits specified in [1]. \n \n \n \nFig. 6: harmonic current spectrum for a 5kW load with respect to full load fundamental current, with \nharmonic limits from [1]. \n  \nThe harmonic spectrum for low load current with respect to the full (5kW) fundamental current also \nsatisfies the specified limits\u2014see Fig. 7. \n \nFig. 7: harmonic current spectrum for a 1kW load with respect to full load fundamental current, with \nharmonic limits from [1]. \n \nTransient load operation occurs during a flight profile for a control surface actuator.  It is therefore \nimportant that the proposed solution reacts quickly to such transients.  Consequently, the load is \nstepped from a low 1kW, in steady state, to full 5kW in 0.1 seconds, and then back to 1kW at 0.4 \nseconds, to test the transient response of the system.  The resulting dc link voltage is initially \noscillatory, Fig. 8, although the oscillations are quickly damped in the case of low to high load, \n0.1seconds after the transient, and for the high- to low-power transient, 0.2 seconds afterwards. The \ndegree of the transient, and its impact, is dependent on line impedance and loading of other systems, \nand is beyond the scope of this current paper\u2014it is the subject of on-going investigations. \n \nFig. 8: dc link voltage during step transients in load power. \n \nFrom the results, it is evident that the proposed integrated series active filter can operate satisfactorily \nat both high (5kW) and low (1kW) powers, and can cope adequately with transients between the two \nload levels. \n \nExperimental results \nThe circuit and control system is realised using a TMS320F2812 eZDSP hardware development \nplatform.  The inverters are constructed from SKM 50GB063D Semikron inverter legs, each rated for \n600V and 50A, and using Semikron skyper 32 two-channel driver boards, as shown in Fig. 9. \n \n \n \nFig. 9: Integrated series active filter with 6-pulse diode rectifier. \n \nAs previously discussed, minimum delays in the control circuit is critical to the stable operation of the \nactive filter.  The delay due to the DSP between starting an analogue to digital conversion of the input \nsignals and outputting a PWM reference level is 2.6\u00b5s.  The PWM control signals can only be updated \nat the peak (and trough) of the triangular modulating waveform i.e. at 60kHz.  To minimise delay the \nanalogue to digital conversion is triggered 2.6\u00b5s before the triangular waveform can be updated.  The \ndelay associated with the hardware between the DSP and the IGBT gate is 2.8\u00b5s, giving a total delay \nbetween starting to read in the signals and starting to control an IGBT of 5.4\u00b5s.  The PWM control \nsignal is updated at 60kHz, limited by the IGBT switching frequency, resulting in a possible delay \nbetween 5.4\u00b5s and 22.1\u00b5s. \n \nThe stability criterion from [9] is rearranged in (1) to give the maximum control loop gain, \n \n\u03c4\n\u03c0\n*2\n* LK <            (1) \n \nK  is the current control loop gain, L term is the system inductance, and the \u03c4 term is the delay.  It can \nbe seen from (1) that, for a given gain, the inductance and the delay are proportional.  The inductance \nwill have impedance to the fundamental current. Consequently, as the inductance is increased the \nregulation of the system will degrade, resulting in a lower dc-link voltage that effectively reduces the \ngain of the active filter.  The choice of the inductor size is dependent on the minimum allowed dc-link \nvoltage at full load power.  This therefore defines the maximum current-loop control gain for the \nactive filter.  Due to the use of the outer voltage control loop, a larger inductor can be employed whilst \nsimultaneously delivering a satisfactory dc-link voltage.   The ability to include large inductor values \nis important in this solution due to the high gains that are required in conjunction with the delay of the \ncontrol system. \n \nPassive filter design \nThus far, the inductor has been considered as a means of maintaining system stability, however, its \nprimary value is in the reduction of switching frequency distortion.  The corner frequency of the low \npass filter needs to be as low as possible to attenuate the switching frequency to the greatest extent, \nand as high above the highest harmonic to be compensated, as possible.  If a phase shift is present in \nthe active filter signals, poor compensation will occur, and reduces system stability.  The choice of the \ncorner frequency therefore becomes a trade-off between the level of attenuation of the PWM \nfrequency and the phase-shift produced in the active filter signals.  For aerospace applications, this \ntrade-off is of particular importance due to the higher fundamental frequency i.e. from 50\/60Hz to \n400Hz, whilst the maximum IGBT switching frequency will remains relatively constant.  Here then, \nthe switching frequency is 30kHz and the chosen corner frequency is 10kHz, 25th harmonic. \n   \nThe ratio between the capacitor and the inductor is also of importance.  The larger the capacitance, and \nhence, the lower the resulting inductance, the greater the load the active filter presents to the dc link.  \nTherefore, again it is preferable to utilise the largest possible inductor and the smallest capacitor, \nwhilst maintain the desired level of dc link voltage. \n \nTriplen harmonics \nDuring testing of the integrated series active filter, triplen harmonics are evident as a consequence of \nthe magnetising currents in the transformer core [11].  Due to its structure, the integrated series active \nfilter is unable to directly compensate for the triplens since they are in-phase with one another.  Hence, \nwhen converted to the dq domain, they cancel and don\u2019t appear in the control signals.  To limit the \nmagnitude of the current triplen, three trifilar wound inductors are situated on the same core.  When \nthe currents through each inductor are balanced, three-phase, and with \u00b1 120\u00b0 phase shift, the net flux \nin the core is zero.   \n \nOuter control loop voltage gain \nThe outer control loop is used to compensate for fundamental voltage drops across the active filter, \nthereby allowing higher inductor values, and, in turn, higher current loop gains to be employed.  The \nresults of including voltage loop gain are shown in Fig. 10.  The inductor value is 3.1mH and the load \nis 30\u2126.   It can be seen that with the introduction of only a small amount of voltage loop gain the \nresulting dc-link voltage is significantly increased.  It can also be seen that the relative impact of the \nvoltage loop gain, on dc-link voltage, reduces as the gain is increased.  This is expected and is a \nconsequence of the increased load that the active filter presents to the dc-link, thereby incurring an \nincreased in the supply current and a higher voltage drop across the active filter.  \n \n \nFig. 10: dc link voltages at versus voltage loop gain. \n \nCurrent spectra  \nThe current spectra of the supply is shown in Fig. 11.  In this case, the dc-link voltage is controlled to \nbe 220V with voltage control loop gain of 0.5.   \n \nFig. 11: Harmonic current spectrum with a 1.6kW load. \n \nThe large peak shown on the left of Fig.11 is the fundamental component, with a magnitude of 3.75 \ndB.  The two dashed vertical lines are placed at the 5th and the 7th harmonics, which have similar \nmagnitude of \u201330.435 dB.  This gives a magnitude relative to the fundamental of 1.95%.  The low \norder current harmonics therefore satisfy the specified limits (2%) for aerospace systems.   \nConclusion \nAn integrated series active filter with 6-pulse diode rectifier has been investigated for its suitability for \nuse with aerospace variable speed drives for flight control surface actuators.  It has been shown in \nsimulation that the proposed solution is capable of improving the harmonic content of the supply \ncurrent to within specified levels, at both fully and low loads.  It was also seen that the dc link voltage \nremained stable during step change transients between the two load levels. \nFinally, using an experimental system, it has been shown that the proposed solution is practically \ncapable of drawing supply currents with a harmonic current within the specified levels. \nReferences \n[1] Paice D A., \u201cPower electronic converter harmonics: multipulse methods for clean power\u201d, IEEE press, pp. 7, \n1995. \n[2] Matheson E, Karimi K, \u201cPower quality specification development for more electric airplane architectures\u201d, \nSociety of automotive engineers, 2002-01-326. \n[3] SAE aerospace standard, minimum performance standards for aerospace electrical power converters, \nAS4361. \n[4] Department of defence interface standard, aircraft electrical power characteristics, MIL-STD-704E. \n[5] Singh B, et al, \u201cA review of three phase improved power quality AC-DC converters\u201d, IEEE Transactions on \nindustrial electronics, Vol. 51, No. 3, June 2004. \n[6] Kolar J W, Ertl H, \u201cStatus of the techniques of three phase rectifier systems with low effects on the mains\u201d, \n21st INTELEC, June 6-9 1999, Copenhagen Denmark. \n[7] Peng F Z, \u201cApplication issues of active power filters\u201d, IEEE Industrial applications magazine, Vol. 4, No. 5, \nSeptember\/October 1998, pp 21 \u2013 30. \n[8] Fujita H, Akagi H, \u201cAn approach to harmonic current free ac\/dc power conversion for large industrial loads: \nThe integration of a series active filter with a  double-series diode rectifier\u201d, IEEE transactions on industry \napplications, Vol. 33, No. 5, September\/October 1997. \n[9] Srianthumrong S, Fujita H, Akagi H, \u201cStability analysis of a series active filter integrated with a double series \ndiode rectifier\u201d, IEEE transactions on power electronics, Vol. 17, No.1, January 2002. \n[10] Arrillaga J, Watson N R, \u201cPower system harmonics\u201d, John Wiley and sons Ltd, pp. 62, 2003. \n"}
