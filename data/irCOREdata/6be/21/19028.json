In addition,\ngermline mutations in VHL, SDHB and SDHD are\nassociated with susceptibility to renal cell carcinoma\n(RCC), though the risk of RCC is about five times\nhigher in VHL disease (Maher et al. 1990, Latif et al.\n1993, Vanharanta et al. 2004, Ong et al. 2007, Ricketts\net al. 2008, 2010). Several mechanisms have been\nimplicated in the development of VHL-related and\nSDHB\/D-related phaeochromocytomas. The VHL\ntumour suppressor gene product (pVHL) has multiple\nfunctions (see Frew & Krek 2007 references within)\nbut its best-characterised function is the ability to\nregulate proteasomal degradation of hypoxia-inducible\nfactor (HIF)-1a and HIF-2a (Maxwell et al. 1999), and\noverexpression of HIF-2a in a RCC cell line counter-\nacts pVHL tumour suppressor activity (Kondo et al.\n2003). Inactivation of SDHB\/D has been linked to\naccumulation of succinate that inhibits the prolyl\nhydroxylase enzymes necessary for proteasomal\ndegradation of HIF-a subunits (Selak et al. 2005);\nphaeochromocytomas from patients with germline\nVHL, SDHB and SDHD mutations demonstrate\nup-regulation of HIF-1a and HIF-2a and their down-\nstream targets (Pollard et al. 2006). Although HIF\ndysregulation and a pseudohypoxic state are features of\nboth VHL- and SDHB\/D-associated tumours, another\npotential mechanism for phaeochromocytoma suscept-\nibility in these disorders is a failure of normal prolyl\nhydroxylase domain isoform 3 (PHD3) (EGLN3)-\ndependent developmental apoptosis of sympathetic\nneuronal cells causing persistence of \u2018phaeochromo-\ncytoma precursor cells\u2019 (Lee et al. 2005). This latter\nprocess has also been linked to other phaeochromo-\ncytoma susceptibility disorders (multiple endocrine\nneoplasia type 2 and neurofibromatosis) (Lee et al. 2005).\nIn normoxia, the HIF-1 and HIF-2 a-subunits are\nrapidly ubiquitylated and targeted for proteasomal\ndegradation by a pVHL containing E3 ubiquitin ligase\ncomplex (Maxwell et al. 1999). The oxygen-dependent\ninteraction of pVHL with HIF-a is determined by the\nhydroxylation status of key HIF-a proline residues\n(Pro-402 and Pro-564 in HIF-1a) (Ivan et al. 2001,\nJaakkola et al. 2001, Masson et al. 2001, Yu et al.\n2001): non-hydroxylated HIF-a binds to pVHL74approximately a 100-fold less tightly than hydroxyl-\nated HIF-a (Chan et al. 2002). Thus in the presence of\noxygen, HIF-a hydroxylation is catalysed by prolyl\nhydroxylases that are members of the egg-laying-\ndefective nine (EGLN) family (Bruick & McKnight\n2001, Epstein et al. 2001). Under hypoxic conditions,\nthe rate of prolyl hydroxylation, and hence the rate\nof proteasomal degradation of HIF-a, slows because\npVHL binds only very weakly to the HIF-a subunits\nleading to stabilisation of HIF-1 and HIF-2 hetero-\ndimeric transcription factors and activation of the array\nof genes involved in the hypoxic response. In humans,\nthree EGLN homologues have been implicated in\nHIF-a modification: PHD1\/EGLN2\/HIFPH1, PHD2\/\nEGLN1\/HIFPH2 and PHD3\/EGLN3\/HIFPH3 (Bruick\n& McKnight 2001, Epstein et al. 2001). To date,\ngermline mutations in PHD2 have been associated\nwith congenital polycythaemia and, in one case\/family,\nrecurrent extra-adrenal phaeochromocytoma (Percy\net al. 2006, 2007, Al-Sheikh et al. 2008, Ladroue\net al. 2008). We hypothesised that patients with\nfeatures of inherited susceptibility to phaeochromo-\ncytoma and\/or RCC might harbour germline mutations\nin PHD1, PHD2 or PHD3. To test this hypothesis, we\nanalysed two large patient cohorts without mutations\nin known susceptibility genes.Materials and methods\nPatients and samples\nWe analysed DNA from a) 82 individuals with features\nof inherited phaeochromocytoma (extra-adrenal\ntumours in 23 cases) susceptibility (i.e. familial\nphaeochromocytoma (nZ6), multiple tumours\n(nZ30) or young age at onset (diagnosed age 30\nyears or less, range 5\u201330 years, median 19 years\n(nZ46)) but no detectable mutations in VHL, SDHB,\nSDHD or RET and b) 64 patients with features of\nRCC susceptibility (25 probands from familial RCC\nkindreds, 14 individuals with bilateral or multicentric\nRCC and 25 individuals with isolated unilateral early-\nonset RCC (diagnosis aged 40 years or less; range\n17\u201340 years, median 28 years)) but no evidence of a\ngermline mutation in a known RCC susceptibility gene\n(VHL, SDHB, FH and FLCN) (most cases had clear cell\nRCC) (Ricketts et al. 2008, Woodward et al. 2008).\nMolecular genetic analyses\nMutation analysis of HIF prolyl hydroxylases\n(PHD\/EGLN1\u20133)\nPHD1\/EGLN2 (exons 1\u20135), PHD2\/EGLN1 (exons 1\u20135)\nand PHD3\/EGLN3 (exons 1\u20135) (see Figure 1) werewww.endocrinology-journals.org\n278\u2013376aa \u2013 Fe20G\nDioxygenase domain\n297aa \u2013 Iron\nBinding site\n299aa \u2013 Iron\nBinding site\n358aa \u2013 Iron\nBinding site\nPHD1 (EGLN2)\nPHD2 (EGLN1)\nPHD3 (EGLN3)\np.H196A\nMutation produces catalytically dead protein\np.R85\n(c.24G>C)\n116\u2013214aa \u2013 Fe20G\nDioxygenase domain\n1aa\n367aa\u20132 \u2013 oxyglutarate\nBinding site\n135aa \u2013 Iron\nBinding site\n137aa \u2013 Iron\nBinding site\n196aa \u2013 Iron\nBinding site\n205aa \u2013 2-oxyglutarate\nBinding site\n239aa\np.P317R \u2013 Erythrocytosis\nPercy et al.

Mutant PHD3\/EGLN3 Arg8Ser was\ngenerated using the QuickChange site-directed muta-\ngenesis kit (Stratagene, Amsterdam, Netherlands) with\nprimers 5 0-ACACATCATGAGCCTGGACCTGGAG-\n3 0 (forward)and5 0-CTCCAGGTCCAGGCTCATGAT-\nGTGT-3 0 (reverse) and verified by DNA sequencing.\nPHD3 induced apoptosis assays\nTwo different apoptosis assays were performed; an\ninitial method to demonstrate differences and a second,\nmore sensitive method. The first apoptosis assay\nwas performed essentially as described by Lee et al.\n(2005). Undifferentiated rat PC12 cells were plated\nonto collagen-coated 6-well plates and were cotrans-\nfected the following day with 500 ng of GFP histone\nand either 1 mg of wild-type PHD3, PHD3-Arg8Ser,\nPHD3-His196Ala (catalytic dead mutant) or pcDNA3.\nTransfection was carried out using Lipofectamine 200075\nD Astuti, C J Ricketts et al.: Mutation analysis of HIF prolyl hydroxylases(Invitrogen). Scoring of apoptotic cells (characterised\nas having condensed or fragmented nuclei) was done\n72 h after transfection. Approximately, 400 cells were\nscored for each sample. Samples were blinded and\nassays were performed in duplicate.\nFor the second apoptosis assay, sympathetic neurons\nwere isolated from the superior cervical ganglia (SCG)\nas previously described (Palmada et al. 2002). Briefly,\nSCG from Sprague\u2013Dawley rats were isolated at\npostnatal day 4 (P4), and sympathetic neurons were\ndissociated with 0.25% trypsin and 0.3% collagenase\nfor 30 min at 37 8C. After dissociation, the neurons\nwere then cotransfected with GFP and either wild-type\nPHD3, PHD3-Arg8Ser, PHD3-His196Ala or pcDNA3\nby electroporation on an Amaxa Nucleofector device\nas described previously (Kenchappa et al. 2006).\nForty-eight hours later, cells were fixed in 4%\nparaformaldehyde (PFA) and stained with DAPI\n(Vector Laboratories, Peterborough, UK). The number\nof GFP-positive neurons with apoptotic or non-\napoptotic nuclei was counted and w50\u201380 neurons\nwere evaluated for each sample. The assay was\nperformed in triplicate with three different electropora-\ntions using different rat litters.\nStatistical analysis\nResults for the apoptosis assays were compared using\ntwo-tailed Student\u2019s t-tests.Results\nAnalysis of PHD3\nThe five exons and flanking sequences of PHD3 were\nsequenced in a) 82 patients with features of non-\nsyndromic inherited phaeochromocytoma suscept-\nibility (i.e. familial phaeochromocytoma, multiple\ntumours or young age at onset) but no detectable\nmutations inVHL, SDHB, SDHD orRET, b) 22 sporadic\nphaeochromocytoma and c) 64 patients with featuresMET\/A\nILE VAL PRO\nTRP\/\nASP SER SER\nSER\/ SER\/\nGLY GLY TYR MET ARG L\nPHD3\/EG\np.R8S c.G\nPHD2\/EGLN1\np.S289G c.A865G\nPHD2\/EGLN1\np.S247W c.C740G\nPHD1\/EGLN2\np.V183M c.G547A\nFigure 2 Sequence chromatographs of variants of PHD1, PHD2 a\ncoding region and amino acid changes.

Sequence variants identified\nin patients were then tested for in normal controls.\nA germline missense substitution, c.24GOC\n(p.Arg8Ser), was detected in 1 of 82 patients with\nfeatures of non-syndromic inherited phaeochromo-\ncytoma susceptibility (see Fig. 2A) (but not in 222\ncontrol chromosomes). The substitution was predicted\nto be benign and tolerated by bioinformatic analysis\nwith the Polyphen and SIFT programs, and occurred in\nthe N-terminal region of the protein which, by analogy\nwith structural and biochemical work on the catalytic\ndomain of PHD2 (residues 181\u2013426, tPHD2 here-\nafter), is unlikely to be directly involved in catalysis\n(McDonough et al. 2006, Flashman et al. 2008,\nChowdhury et al. 2009; see Figs 1, 3 and\nTable 1). The female patient had bilateral adrenal\nphaeochromocytomas at age 22. She showed no\nclinical evidence of a known familial susceptibility\nsyndrome and no family history of phaeochromo-\ncytoma. The missense substitution was not detected in\nher clinically unaffected father and sister, but it was not\npossible to determine whether it had arisen de novo\nbecause no DNA was available from her mother who\nhad died from an unrelated cause.

Crystallographic\nanalyses (Chowdhury et al. 2009) reveal that Ser289 is\nnot involved with the active site (see Figs 1 and 5).Analysis of PHD1\nMutation analysis of PHD1 in 82 patients with\nevidence of inherited phaeochromocytoma suscept-\nibility revealed a novel non-synonymous p.Ser58Leu\n(c.173COT) germline missense substitution (see\nFig. 2B) in 5 cases (6%) and 3\/116 (2.6%) normal\ncontrols (PZ0.29).\nA novel missense p.Val183Met (c.547 GOA)\nsubstitution was detected in a patient with familial\nRCC (see Fig. 2A). Both the proband and her father\nhad been affected with RCC in the sixth decade, but\ngermline DNA was not available from other relatives.\nThe substitution was not detected in 222 chromosomes\nfrom normal subjects, and bioinformatic analysis gave\nconflicting results with Polyphen suggested that this\nwas a benign substitution but the SIFT program\nreporting it to be intolerant (see Table 1). Val183 is\nconserved down to D. rerio, but not to D. melanogaster\nor C. elegans (see Fig. 3).\nNo potential pathogenic variants were detected in 22\nsporadic phaeochromocytoma tumours.78Discussion\nWe did not find any evidence that germline mutations\nin PHD1, PHD2 or PHD3 are frequent causes of\ninherited susceptibility to phaeochromocytoma or\nRCC. Thus, although Ladroue et al. (2008) reported\na patient with recurrent paraganglioma and a germline\nPHD2 missense mutation (c.1121A\/G, p.H374R,\nwith loss of the wild-type allele in paraganglioma\ntissue), our findings suggest that PHD2 mutations are\nrare in patients with features of inherited phaeo-\nchromocytoma (95% confidence interval 0\u20134.4%).\nPHD2 mutations were initially described in association\nwith familial erythrocytosis (Percy et al. 2006, 2007,\nAl-Sheikh et al. 2008) and that the patient reported by\nLadroue et al. (2008) had both recurrent paragan-\nglioma and congenital erythrocytosis. Although it\nmight be hypothesised that germline PHD2 mutations\nmight be restricted to phaeochromocytoma patients\nwith congenital erythrocytosis, we did not identify a\nPHD2 mutation in a patient with early onset\nphaeochromocytoma and erythrocytosis.\nAll three PHD isoforms regulate both HIF-1a and\nHIF-2a, but differ in expression patterns, specificities\nfor the two different prolyl hydroxylation sites within\nthe HIF-1a and 2a subunits, and a degree of selectivity\nbetween HIF-a isoforms (Appelhoff et al. 2004, Raval\net al. 2005). PHD2 appears to be the major regulator of\nHIF-a prolyl hydroxylation in normoxia and mild\nhypoxia, and we postulated that PHD2 mutations (that\nled to HIF dysregulation) might present with inherited\nRCC (previously, a similar approach had revealed\nunsuspected germline SDHB and FLCN mutations in\nw10% of patients with apparently non-syndromic\ninherited RCC (Ricketts et al. 2008, Woodward et al.\n2008)). Although we detected a novel PHD2 missense\nvariant (c.840 COG, p.S247W) in a proband with two\nindependent RCC, the significance of this finding is\nuncertain. While the absence of the variant in 222\nchromosomes from normal subjects and bioinformatic\nanalysis were suggestive of pathogenicity (the S247\nresidue is conserved in D. rerio), we are unable to\nprove a loss of function effect. S247 is located in the\nvariable region (variable with respect to PHD1, PHD2\nand PHD3 sequences) between strands b2 and b3\n(referred to as \u2018b2b3 loop\u2019) in the published crystal\nstructures of PHD2 (McDonough et al. 2006,\nChowdhury et al. 2009). Subsequent biophysical\nanalyses have shown that this region is flexible and\ninvolved in determining the prolyl hydroxylation site\nselectivity of the PHDs (Villar et al. 2007, Flashman\net al. 2008, Chowdhury et al. 2009). However, a point\nmutation at this position (Ser289Lys) that could bewww.endocrinology-journals.org\nS247\nD315\nH374\nNOG\nH313\nP564\nS289\nV199\nP187\nMn\nN\n\u03b22\/\u03b23 loop C\nHelix\n\u03b14\nFigure 5 Ribbon representation of tPHD2.CODD complex\nstructure showing the germline mutation sites (highlighted in\nwhite) in PHD2 (Chowdhury et al. 2009). The tPHD2 fold\ncomprises four a helices and ten b strands of which eight\nstrands form a double-stranded b helix (DSBH) (McDonough\net al. 2006, Chowdhury et al. 2009). The recognition of HIF-a by\nPHDs involves interactions that are discrete from the hydroxy-\nlation site involving the b2\/b3 loop and the C-terminal a4 helix\namong others. Although the b2\/b3 loop of PHD2 makes\nhydrophobic contacts with the conserved LXXLAP motif,\nresidue S247 is located on a part of b2\/b3 loop that does not\ninteract with HIF-a. The figure also shows that residues S289,\nV199 (analogous to V183 in PHD1) and P187 (analogous to R8\nin PHD3) are far from the HIF-a-binding sites or the catalytic\nFe\/2OG-binding motifs in PHD2.\nEndocrine-Related Cancer (2011) 18 73\u201383produced in the soluble form was as active as wild-type\nPHD2 (in studies using recombinant tPHD2) with\nrespect to hydroxylation of the peptide fragments of the\nN- and C-terminal oxygen-dependent degradation\ndomains of HIF-1a when these were tested either\nseparately or simultaneously in competition revealing\nthat (at least) under standard incubation conditions,\nmutations at Ser289 are unlikely to affect absolute\nactivity or selectivity with respect to the hydroxylation\nsites on HIF-a (data not shown).\nDistinguishing mutations from non-pathogenic\nsequence variants and predicting the functional effect\nof rare missense variants on protein function can be\nchallenging, but while the pathogenicity of the\np.S247W missense substitution cannot be unequivo-\ncally established or disproved, our results do suggest\nthat germline PHD2 mutations are not a frequent cause\nof inherited RCC. Similarly, a possible PHD1 missense\nmutation (pVal183Met) was detected in only onewww.endocrinology-journals.orgproband with features of non-syndromic inherited\nRCC. While this variant was not detected in O200\ncontrol chromosomes and the V183 residue is con-\nserved in D. rerio, bioinformatic predictions of likely\npathogenicity (Polyphen and SIFT programs) were\nequivocal and the substitution occurs outside of the\nprolyl hydroxylation catalytic domain (AA 189\u2013375).\nFunctional studies of mutant pVHL protein associ-\nated with differing VHL disease phenotypes (e.g. with\ndifferential risks of RCC and phaeochromocytoma)\nsuggest that whereas impairment of the ability to\nregulate HIF is necessary for predisposition to RCC, it\nis not sufficient, and impairment of non-HIF-related\npVHL functions is also required (Clifford et al. 2001).\nHence, mutations that lead only to dysregulation of\nHIF (e.g. germline mutations in PHDs, HIF-1 or HIF-2\ngenes) might not be sufficient to cause an inherited\nRCC phenotype. Interestingly, functional analysis of\npVHL mutants has also suggested that some VHL\nmutations associated with a high risk of phaeochro-\nmocytoma do not compromise pVHL regulation of\nHIF, so implicating HIF-independent mechanisms in\nthe development of VHL-associated phaeochromo-\ncytoma (Clifford et al. 2001, Hoffman et al. 2001).\nConsistent with this hypothesis, Lee et al. (2005)\ndescribed a HIF-independent pathway linked to\ninherited causes of phaeochromocytoma (including\nthose associated with germline VHL, SDHB and SDHD\nmutations). They suggested that inherited phaeo-\nchromocytomas originate from sympathetic neuronal\nprecursor cells that usually undergo c-Jun-dependent\napoptosis during embryogenesis when growth\nfactors such as nerve growth factor (NGF) become\nlimiting (Estus et al. 1994, Schlingensiepen et al. 1994,\nHam et al. 1995, Xia et al. 1995). Germline VHL and\nSDHB mutations compromise this pathway leading to a\nfailure of normal developmental apoptosis and survival\nof cells that would give rise to phaeochromocytoma.\nIntriguingly, PHD3 (but not PHD1 or PHD2) is a key\nmediator of this apoptotic pathway, and germline\nmutations in KIF1BBeta (that encodes a target of\nPHD3\/EGLN3) have been associated with familial\nsusceptibility to neural crest tumours (Schlisio et al.\n2008). Furthermore, PHD3 knockout mice demon-\nstrated increased numbers of cells in the superior\ncervical ganglion, adrenal medulla and carotid body\n(Bishop et al. 2008). However, we identified only one\npotential PHD3 mutation in our cohort of inherited\nphaeochromocytoma probands and, although the\nmissense variant was not detected in normal controls,\nwe did not detect any evidence that the p.Arg8Ser\nimpaired neuronal apoptosis to a substantial degree (as\ncompared to a catalytically inert mutant). Although the79\nD Astuti, C J Ricketts et al.: Mutation analysis of HIF prolyl hydroxylasespartial loss of functional effect of the p.Arg8Ser mutant\nin the sensitive rat sympathetic neuron apoptosis assay\nsuggests that the variant might contribute to phaeo-\nchromocytoma susceptibility, we suggest that germline\nPHD3 mutations are not a frequent cause of inherited\nphaeochromocytoma. Germline mutations in both VHL\nand SDHB\/D mutations are important causes of\nfamilial phaeochromocytoma; however, somatic\nmutations of these genes are infrequent in sporadic\ntumours (Eng et al. 1995, Astuti et al. 2001a,b). Hence,\nwe concentrated our efforts on testing for germline\nPHD1, PHD2 and PHD3 mutations in patients with\nfeatures of inherited phaeochromocytoma. In our\npreliminary analysis of sporadic phaeochromocytoma,\nwe did not find any frequent evidence for somatic\ninactivation of PHD1, PHD2 or PHD3. In contrast to\nphaeochromocytoma, somatic VHL mutations are very\nfrequent in sporadic RCC (Foster et al. 1994, Gnarra\net al. 1994, Banks et al. 2006) (though somatic SDHB\ninactivation is rare in RCC (Morris et al. 2004)).\nHowever, large-scale resequencing of RCC samples\n(nZ101) did not detect mutations in PHD1, PHD2 or\nPHD3 (Dalgliesh et al. 2010), and we have not\ndetected frequent evidence of up-regulation of any of\nthe three prolyl hydroxylase genes in RCC cell lines\ntreated with 5-azacytidine (Morris et al. 2010 and\nunpublished studies). The absence of germline PHD1,\nPHD2 or PHD3 mutations in inherited phaeochromo-\ncytoma or RCC might suggest that inactivation of one\nof these genes is insufficient to replicate the range of\npro-oncogenic effects associated with pathogenic\ngermline VHL or SDHB\/D mutations. pVHL has been\nreported to have multiple functions (Frew & Krek\n2007), and while inactivation of SDH has been linked\nto accumulation of succinate and resulting inhibition of\nprolyl hydroxylase enzymes that are necessary for\nproteasomal degradation of HIF-a subunits (Selak\net al. 2005), succinate accumulation may also inhibit\nother 2-oxoglutarate-dependent enzyme superfamily\nmembers which may also contribute to the develop-\nment of SDHB\/D-associated tumours (e.g. histone\ndemethylases, some of which are implicated in the\nepigenetic regulation of oncogenes and tumour\nsuppressor genes) (Smith et al. 2008). Nevertheless, a\nsignificant fraction of patients with features of\ninherited phaeochromocytoma or RCC do not have a\ndetectable mutation in a known susceptibility gene.\nThe advent of comprehensive genomic analysis\ntechniques (e.g. whole exome resequencing) (Kryukov\net al. 2009, Summerer et al. 2010) should expedite the\nidentification of novel phaeochromocytoma\/RCC pre-\ndisposition genes and so provide further insights into\nthe mechanism of tumourigenesis in these disorders.80Declaration of interest\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interest that\ncould be perceived as prejudicing the impartiality of the\nresearch reported.Funding\nThis research did not receive any specific grant from\nany funding agency in the public, commercial or not-for-\nprofit sector.Acknowledgements\nWe thank Cancer Research UK and National Institute of\nHealth (Grant NS038220 to B D Carter) for financial support.References\nAl-Sheikh M, Moradkhani K, Lopez M, Wajcman H & Pre\u00b4hu\nC 2008 Disturbance in the HIF-1alpha pathway associated\nwith erythrocytosis: further evidences brought by frame-\nshift and nonsense mutations in the prolylhydroxylase\ndomain protein 2 (PHD2) gene.
