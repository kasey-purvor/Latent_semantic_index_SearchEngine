Res., 110, A10211, doi:10.1029\/2004JA010980.\n1. Introduction\n[2] In recent years several studies have been performed\non dayside auroral dynamics and ionospheric convection\nwhen the IMF Bz component has been directed northward.\nThese studies have been aided by recent advances in auroral\nimagers and radar technology, allowing almost global\nimaging of the auroral regions and of ionospheric high-\nlatitude convection. Milan et al. [2000a] studied POLAR\nUVI observations of the Northern Hemisphere auroral\nemission during an interval when the interplanetary mag-\nnetic field (IMF) had a predominantly positive IMF Bz\ncomponent, but varying IMF By. They reported the exis-\ntence of a region of luminosity near local noon at latitudes\npoleward of the dayside auroral oval. This spot corre-\nsponded to the ionospheric footprint of the high-latitude\nreconnection site, and hence the cusp under these condi-\ntions. The location of this cusp aurora in latitude and\nmagnetic local time was found to vary in response to\nchanges in the orientation of the IMF. The cusp aurora\nMLT and the IMF By component were especially well\ncorrelated, the emission being located in the prenoon or\npostnoon sectors for By < 0 nT or By > 0 nT, respectively.\n[3] Subsequently Frey et al. [2003a] presented data from\nthe SI-12 imager on the IMAGE spacecraft, showing the\noccurrence of the dayside proton auroral spot during two\nintervals of Northward IMF. They reported that the dayside\nauroral spot was present continuously for many hours.\nHowever, the luminosity of the spot varied over time. Frey\net al. [2003a] interpreted the continuous presence of the\nproton auroral spot as indicating that the dayside reconnec-\ntion process is continuous and even quasi-steady. Frey et al.\n[2003a, p. 534] stated that \u2018\u2018continuous reconnection oper-\nates at a variable rate but never ceases; if the fluctuation is a\nsmall fraction of the average then the reconnection is\nclassed as \u2018quasi-steady.\u2019\u2019\u2019\n[4] The question of whether dayside reconnection is\npulsed or continuous is of fundamental importance to\nresearchers aiming to understand the dayside reconnection\nprocess. Sandholt et al. [1993, 1998] observed transient\noptical cusp features associated with intermittent dayside\nreconnection. Sandholt et al.

Poleward\nmoving regions of antisunward flow measured by HF\nradars, suggested to be associated with pulsed dayside\nreconnection have been reported by Pinnock et al. [1995]\nand Rodger and Pinnock [1997]. Provan et al. [1998]\ninterpreted pulsed ionospheric flows observed by the Super-\nDARN radar during a southward IMF interval as the iono-\nspheric signatures of flux transfer events at the dayside\nmagnetopause. McWilliams et al. [2000] performed a sta-\ntistical study on pulsed ionospheric flows observed by the\nSuperDARN radars, one third of which occurred when the\ninterplanetary magnetic field had a northward component.\nRecently Provan et al. [2005] presented a detailed case\nstudy of global convection during an interval of prolonged\nnorthward IMF, using the SuperDARN radars. They dem-\nonstrated that the relative magnitudes of the IMF By and Bz\ncomponents determined the latitude at which reconnection\nbetween the IMF and the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere occurred\non the magnetopause, and thus whether lobe reconnection\nonly or simultaneous lobe and low-latitude reconnection\noccurred. Crucially, they concluded that during this case\nstudy dayside reconnection was always pulsed.\n[5] In this paper we will use the Northern Hemisphere\nSuperDARN radars to analyze the global convection pattern\nfor one of the intervals discussed by Frey et al. [2003a].\nPulsed high-latitude plasma flows are observed during this\ninterval, which we show are directly related to pulsations in\nthe brightness of the dayside proton auroral spot. The\ncombined observations of the dayside proton auroral spot\nand high-latitude convection demonstrate that high-latitude\ndayside reconnection may be occurring continuously but the\nprocess is certainly not steady, with the signatures of\ndayside reconnection modulated by pressure pulses occur-\nring in the solar wind which were not discussed by Frey et\nal. [2003a].\n2. Instrumentation\n[6] The ionospheric convection velocities presented in\nthis study are provided by the Northern Hemisphere Super-\nDARN radars, part of the international SuperDARN chain\nof HF radars [Greenwald et al., 1995a]. At present there are\n9 SuperDARN radars imaging the high-latitude convection\nin the Northern Hemisphere. Each radar of the system is\nfrequency agile (8\u201320 MHz), and routinely measures the\nline-of-sight (l-o-s) Doppler velocity, the spectral width, and\nthe backscattered power from ionospheric plasma irregular-\nities. The radars each form 16 beams of azimuthal separa-\ntion 3.24\u0001. Each beam is gated into 75 range bins. In the\nstandard operation (normal resolution) mode used here,\neach gate has a length of 45 km and the dwell time for\neach beam is 7 s, giving a full 16 beam scan, covering 52\u0001\nin azimuth and over 3000 km in range (an area of over 4 \u0002\n106 km2), every 2 min.\n[7] In this paper we also present data from the SI-12\nimages on the IMAGE spacecraft. IMAGE is in a highly\nelliptical orbit of 1000 km \u0002 45600 km altitude. The FUV\ninstrument consists of three imaging subinstruments and\nobserves the aurora for 5\u201310 s every 2 min spin period\n[Mende et al., 2000a, 2000b]. The SI-12 observes Doppler-\nshifted Lyman-a emission from precipitating protons with\nenergy of several keV. The auroral emission in a particular\nregion depends on the local precipitation characteristics\n(spectrum and flux) of electrons and protons and the\ncomposition of the atmosphere [Frey et al., 2002]. The\nproton energy fluxes are obtained from the SI-12 count rate\nusing the relationship between the SI-12 signal and NOAA\nin situ measurements of proton precipitation [Coumans et\nal., 2002]. The proton energy flux controls the auroral\nLyman-a auroral emission [Hubert et al., 2001]. The\nauroral Lyman-a brightness is then retrieved accounting\nfor the viewing geometry, assuming a 30 keV mean proton\nenergy. Upstream IMF data are provided by the ACE\nsatellite [Smith et al., 1999].\n3. Data Presentation\n[8] Figure 1 presents the IMF conditions as recorded by\nthe ACE spacecraft on 17 September 2000, from 1600 to\n1930 UT. At 1600 UT ACE is positioned upstream of the\nEarth at GSM position (X, Y, Z) = (231, \u000333, 21) RE. We\nutilized the algorithm of Lester et al. [1993] to calculate a\n40 \u00b1 7 min. delay between the IMF being observed by the\nsatellite and when it impinges on the dayside magnetopause.\nCross correlation between the IMF Bz component, bright-\nness of the proton auroral spot and magnitude of the l-o-s\nvelocity (presented in section 3.4) showed the maximum\ncorrelation between these parameters occurred at a delay\ntime of 34 min, which is within the error range of the delay\ntime calculated using the algorithm of Lester et al. [1993].\nHence a delay time of 34 min has been added to the\ntimescale of the plots. Figure 1a presents the Bx component\n(short-dashed line), the By component (long-dashed line)\nand the Bz component (solid line). The IMF Bz component\nwas positive from 16:00 until \u00011920 UT. Figure 1b presents\nthe absolute value of the IMF By component (dashed) and\nBz component (solid). Figure 1c presents the solar wind\ndynamic pressure. Figures 1d and 1e will be discussed in\nsection 3.3. We have decided to look at two intervals\nduring this period in more detail. During interval A (1620\nto 1700 UT) the IMF By component was predominantly\nlarger than, or equal to, the IMF Bz component. During\ninterval B (1700 to 1920 UT) the opposite was generally\ntrue, with the IMF Bz component being predominantly\nlarger than, or equal to, the IMF By component.\n[9] Figure 2 presents the f-o-v of the Kapuskasing radar\nat 1630 UT (Figure 2, top) and 1920 UT (Figure 2, bottom).\nThe plots are in MLAT\/MLT coordinates, with 1200 MLT\nbeing located at the top of the page. Below we will be\npresenting l-o-s velocity data from beam 10 of this radar,\nthis beam is marked on the plots with white lines. The plots\nshow that at both 1630 and 1920 UT beam 10 of the\nKapuskasing radar is observing the high-latitude noon\nregion in the Northern Hemisphere.\n[10] Figure 3 presents the l-o-s velocity data observed\nin beam 10 of the Kapuskasing radar between 1620 and\n1920 UT on 17 September 2000, plotted versus magnetic\nlatitude. The Kapuskasing radar is observing the dayside\nauroral zone during this time. The plot show color-coded\nl-o-s velocity as a function of time, where positive values\n(green and blue) show flows toward the radar, while\nnegative values (yellow and red) show flows away from\nthe radar. A dashed black line separating the two time\nintervals A and B is marked on the plot. The radar clearly\nA10211 PROVAN ET AL.: DAYSIDE RECONNECTION DURING NORTHWARD IMF\n2 of 13\nA10211\nobserves a number of flow bursts of high-velocity tran-\nsients. Some of these flow bursts have been identified in\nFigure 3 by red arrows, in order to guide the eye. During\ninterval A two flow bursts are observed, appearing as red\nstripes in Figure 3, indicating that the l-o-s velocity within\neach plasma flow burst is directed away from the radar.\nThe transients move to higher latitude with time, with the\nfirst flow burst reaching a maximum latitude of 85\u0001 at\n\u00011640 UT. During interval B the bursts appear as pulsed\nblue stripes in Figure 3, indicating that the l-o-s velocity\nwithin these transients is directed toward the radar. These\nflow bursts appear to be moving to lower latitude with\ntime, especially when we consider the backscatter power\nassociated with them (not shown). We will now study the\nFigure 1.

Interval A\n[11] We wish to examine the relationship between the\nflow bursts observed during interval A and the proton\naurora. Figure 4 presents two snapshots of the proton aurora\nfrom the spectrographic imager channel SI-12 on board the\nIMAGE spacecraft as it images the Northern Hemisphere.\nThe images are shown on a geomagnetic grid of latitude and\nlocal time, with the noon meridian at the top and dawn to\nthe right. In Figure 4 (left) the auroral images are presented\ncolor-coded in intensity. Blue represents the weakest inten-\nsity, and red the strongest intensity. All intensities above\n1.35 kR are colored red. In Figure 4 (right) the same auroral\nimages are presented in black and white, and with radar\ndata superposed. Snapshots of the proton aurora are\npresented at two times, at the beginning of the first flow\nburst at 1633:19 UT (Figure 4, top), and at the end of this\nfirst flow burst at 1641:29 UT (Figure 4, bottom). Overlaid\non the proton auroral images presented in Figure 4 (right),\nare the fitted map potential flow vectors and equipotential\nstreamlines for the 2 min intervals 1632\u20131634 UT (Figure 4,\ntop) and 1640\u20131642 UT (Figure 4, bottom). These global\nflow patterns were created by combining l-o-s velocities\nfrom all the Northern Hemisphere SuperDARN radars, using\nthe map potential algorithm [Ruohoniemi and Baker, 1998].\nThe technique outputs a number of different vectors. The\n\u2018\u2018fitted\u2019\u2019 vectors which are presented here are produced by\n\u2018\u2018fitting\u2019\u2019 the l-o-s velocity vectors to an expansion of the\nelectrostatic potential in spherical harmonics. The l-o-s\nvelocity vectors were obtained from the eight Northern\nHemisphere SuperDARN radars available at this time.\nThere is a lack of radar coverage on the local nightside\nas there is a gap in the global coverage of the SuperDARN\nradars in this region.\n[12] The radars observe two \u2018\u2018standard\u2019\u2019 convection cells,\nin which the flow rotates in the same direction as iono-\nspheric cells observed under southward IMF conditions,\nwith antisunward flow at high latitude and sunward flow at\nlower latitude. The dayside convection throat is positioned\nprenoon and the cusp flow is tilted in an eastward direction.\nWe believe this dawn-dusk asymmetry to be due to the\nstrong negative IMF By component during interval A\n[Cowley et al., 1991]. Simultaneously we can clearly iden-\ntify the proton auroral oval, within which a spot-like auroral\nbrightening is observed in the noon region. Previous work\nby, e.g., Frey et al. [2003b] has identified such a proton\nauroral spot lying within the proton oval to be the optical\nmanifestation of the ionospheric footprint of the cusp. Frey\net al. [2003b] made these observations during intervals of\nlow-latitude merging when the IMF was directed southward.\nOur observations thus support previous findings by, e.g.,\nClauer and Friis-Christensen [1988], Freeman et al.\n[1993], and Greenwald et al. [1995b], suggesting that\nduring intervals of positive IMF Bz and a large IMF By,\nthe magnetic shear at the dayside magnetopause is suffi-\ncient for reconnection to occur on closed field lines at\nlower latitudes on the magnetopause, resulting in the\nexcitation of a two-cell convection pattern.\n[13] The two flow patterns presented in Figure 4 clearly\nillustrate how the flow burst observed by the Kapuskasing\nradar is associated with a strong increase in the plasma\nflow in the high-latitude cusp region, with much stronger\ncusp flows being observed at 1640\u20131642 UT than at\n1632\u20131634 UT. Similar pulsed ionospheric flows (PIFs)\nhave been observed by the SuperDARN radars [Provan et\nal., 1998], and have been identified as being the ionospheric\nsignatures of flux transfer events occurring at the dayside\nmagnetopause. Figure 4 demonstrates that simultaneously\nwith the increase in the strength of the cusp flow, the proton\nauroral spot becomes brighter and shifts in longitude. At\n1633:19 UT the proton auroral spot is observed in the noon\nregion and has a peak brightness of 1.6 kR. By 1641:29 UT\nthe proton spot has increased in brightness with a peak\nFigure 2.

At 1632\u2013\n1634 UT the cusp flow is observed westward, and slightly\npoleward, of the proton spot. At 1640\u20131642 UT the\nstrongest plasma velocities are mainly eastward and pole-\nward of the auroral spot.\n[14] During the interval presented in this paper, we noted\nthat the proton auroral spot can be associated with a flow\navoidance region. Figure 5 presents four selected proton\nauroral images observed during interval A at 1621:04,\n1651:42, 1655:47 and 1657:50 UT. Overlaid on the plots\nare the corresponding map potential flow vectors. It can be\nseen from studying the images that the brightest region of\nthe proton auroral spot is often associated with a lack of\nradar backscatter and possible flow avoidance, with plasma\nflow seemingly being diverted around the spot.\n3.2. Interval B\n[15] During interval B (1700 to 1920 UT) the IMF Bz\ncomponent is predominantly greater than or equal to the\nIMF By component. Figure 6 shows two snapshots of the\nproton auroral oval and spot observed by the spectro-\ngraphic imager channel SI-12 on IMAGE during interval\nB, and the simultaneous Northern Hemisphere convection\npatterns, presented in the same format as in Figure 4, but\nwith a slight modification to the color scale. The Kapus-\nkasing radar identified a flow burst at \u00011852 UT. Figure 6\n(top) presents the proton aurora (1852:12 UT) and the\nglobal convection pattern (1852\u20131854 UT) during the\nflow burst, and Figure 6 (bottom) presents the proton\naurora (1910:35 UT) and the global convection pattern\n(1910\u20131912 UT) after the flow burst. The observed global\nconvection patterns are very different from the convection\npatterns presented in Figure 4. Now the radars observe\nmulticell convection patterns, with \u2018\u2018reverse\u2019\u2019 cells at high\nlatitudes in the dayside sector and the vestiges of \u2018\u2018nor-\nmal\u2019\u2019 flow cells at lower latitude. The overall flow patterns\nare typical of flows observed during northward IMF when\nlobe merging is occurring [e.g., Heelis et al., 1986; Knipp\net al., 1991; Freeman et al., 1993; Huang et al., 2000;\nMilan et al., 2000a].\n[16] In both snapshots of the proton aurora, the proton\nauroral oval and proton spot are clearly observed. The\nintensity of the proton auroral ovals are enhanced in\ncomparison with the auroral images presented in Figure 4.\nIndeed the average peak brightness of the proton auroral\nspot during interval B is 2.7 kR, compared with 2.1 kR\nduring interval A. During interval B the auroral spot has\nmoved poleward of the main auroral oval. Milan et al.\n[2000a] identified the UVauroral spot observed poleward of\nthe UV auroral oval during an interval of northward IMF as\nthe ionospheric footprint of the high-latitude lobe recon-\nnection site. Preliminary results (not presented) demonstrate\nthat during the interval discussed here the proton auroral\nspot is colocated with enhanced electron precipitation which\nappears as an elongated arc in the east-west direction, as has\npreviously been observed using high-resolution ground-\nbased optical observations during strongly northward IMF\nconditions [Sandholt et al., 2000].\n[17] As stated above, the Kapuskasing radar observes a\nflow burst at \u00011852 UT. Figure 6 (top) clearly shows\nenhanced flows within the high-latitude cusp region at this\ntime, compared with the flow pattern observed after the\nflow burst at 1910:35 UT. These high-velocity plasma flows\nare observed both within the sunward flow in the cusp\nFigure 3. Line-of-sight velocity data observed by beam 10 of the Kapuskasing radar between 1620 and\n1920 UT on 17 September 2000, plotted versus magnetic latitude. The Kapuskasing radar is observing\nthe cusp region during this time. The plots shows color-coded l-o-s velocity as a function of time, where\npositive values (green and blue) show flows toward the radar, while negative values (yellow and red)\nshow flows away from the radar. A dashed black line separating the two time intervals, A and B, is\nmarked on the plot. A selection of flow bursts has been identified with red arrows.\nA10211 PROVAN ET AL.: DAYSIDE RECONNECTION DURING NORTHWARD IMF\n5 of 13\nA10211\nregion, and within the antisunward flow in the postnoon\nregion. Simultaneously, the auroral spot is brighter and\nlarger during the flow burst than after it. Interestingly, the\nauroral spot again appears to be associated with a lack of\nradar backscatter.\n3.3. Comparison of Proton Aurora and Ionospheric\nFlows\n[18] Figure 7a presents the peak Lyman-a brightness of\nthe proton auroral spot from IMAGE SI-12 for the time\ninterval 1600 to 1930 UT, as presented by Frey et al.\n[2003a]. Figure 7b presents a stack plot of l-o-s velocities\nobserved by beam 8 of the Kapuskasing radar between\n1600 and 1930 UT at ranges 44 to 47 (MLAT 77.1\u0001 to\n78.3\u0001). There is a semiperiodic variation in the brightness\nof the proton spot and ten peaks in the brightness of the\nauroral spot, which have been identified by a visual\ninspection of the data, are marked on the plot with dashed\nblack lines. There is an average interval of \u000122 min\nbetween the maxima in the brightness of the proton auroral\nspot. Figure 7 illustrates that there may be a relationship\nbetween the dayside high-latitude flow and the brightness\nof the proton aurora, with peaks in the auroral brightness\noften occurring simultaneously or almost simultaneously\nwith peaks in the magnitude of the l-o-s velocity (where\nbackscatter is observed). This will be discussed in greater\ndetail below.\n3.4. Cross-Correlation Analysis\n[19] A cross-correlation analysis of the relationship be-\ntween the brightness of the proton aurora and l-o-s velocity\nat Kapuskasing and Goose Bay would clearly be desirable,\nbut this was not possible because of data gaps in the flow\nobservations. Thus we again used the map potential flow\npatterns. For each map potential convection pattern gener-\nated between 1600 and 1930 UT, we averaged the magni-\ntude of all the \u2018\u2018fitted\u2019\u2019 flow vectors observed between 1115\nand 1245 MLT. We are interested in comparing how the\nFigure 4. Snapshots of the proton aurora from the spectrographic imager channel SI-12 on IMAGE at\n(top) 1633:19 UT and (bottom) 1641:29 UT.

As can be\nseen from Figure 1, there is a strong relationship between\nthe peaks in brightness of the proton auroral spot and peaks\nin the magnitude of the cusp flow velocity. The flow\nFigure 5.

All the correlation analyses are presented in\nthe same format. For the sake of clarity we confirm that\nwhen we state, for example, that the auroral brightness is\ncorrelated with respect to the solar wind dynamic pressure,\nthis means that the during the cross correlation the auroral\nbrightness is lagged with respect to the solar wind dynamic\npressure. Figure 8a presents the cross correlation analysis of\nthe mean magnitude of the map potential flow vectors in the\ncusp region with respect to the intensity of the proton\nauroral spot. Figure 8a (top) presents the auroral brightness,\nFigure 8a (middle) presents the flow magnitude, and\nFigure 8a (bottom) presents the cross-correlation coefficient\nas a function of lag. The dashed lines on Figure 8a (bottom)\nshow the correlation coefficient at which the two time\nseries are correlated at a 99% level of significance. If the\ntwo time series are correlated at this level of significance,\nthen there is only a 1% probability that this correlation\ncould have occurred by chance alone such that we conclude\nthat the time series are significantly correlated. At time lags\nof 0 and \u000148 min the correlation coefficient is positive and\ncorrelated at the 99% significance level.\n[21] Figure 8b presents the cross-correlation analysis of\nthe solar wind dynamic pressure with respect to the IMF\nBz component. A 34 min time delay has been added to the\ntimescales of both plots. At a lag of 0 the solar wind\ndynamic pressure and IMF Bz components are significantly\ncorrelated. The correlation coefficient behaves in a periodic\nmanner, reaching a maximum value when the two time series\nare significantly correlated approximately every 40 min.\nStudying the solar wind dynamic pressure, it is clear that it\ntoo behaves in a cyclical manner, reaching a maximum\napproximately every 45\u201350 min.\n[22] The auroral intensity is cross-correlated with respect\nto the solar wind dynamic pressure in Figure 8c, and with\nrespect to the IMF Bz component in Figure 8d. Initial work\nshowed that the maximum correlation between the IMF Bz\ncomponent and the auroral brightness and ionospheric flow\nmagnitude, and also between the auroral brightness and\nsolar wind dynamic pressure, occurred at a lag of 34 min.\nFigure 6.

Overlaid on the proton auroral images are the fitted map potential flow vectors\nand equipotential streamlines for the two minute intervals, 1852\u20131854 UT (Figure 6, top) and 1910\u2013\n1912 UT (Figure 6, bottom).\nA10211 PROVAN ET AL.: DAYSIDE RECONNECTION DURING NORTHWARD IMF\n8 of 13\nA10211\nAs already described in section 3, this lag was taken to\nrepresent the IMF delay time, and has been added to the\ntimescale of the solar wind dynamic pressure (Figure 8c)\nand the IMF Bz component (Figure 8d), and is used\nthroughout this analysis. The auroral brightness and solar\nwind dynamic pressure are correlated at a 99% level of\nsignificance at time lags of 0 and \u000150 min. At a time lag of\nzero the correlation coefficient between the auroral bright-\nness and solar wind dynamic pressure is 0.43, while at the\nsame time lag the correlation coefficient between the auroral\nbrightness and IMF Bz is \u00010.6. It is interesting to note that\nthe correlation coefficient between the auroral brightness\nand the IMF Bz component does not have the same cyclical\nnature as the correlation coefficient between the auroral\nbrightness and solar wind dynamic pressure.\n[23] Figure 8e presents the correlation analysis of the\nmagnitude of the ionospheric flow in the cusp region with\nrespect to the IMF Bz component. A time delay of 34 min\nhas been added to the timescale of the IMF Bz component.\nThe correlation coefficient reaches a maximum at time lags\nof 0 and \u000150 min. Figure 8f presents a correlation analysis\nbetween the averaged flow magnitude with respect to the\nsolar wind pressure. Again the correlation coefficient peaks\nat lags 0 min and \u000150 min.\n[24] The cross-correlation analysis presented above dem-\nonstrates that quasiperiodic fluctuations in the solar wind\ndynamic pressure are correlate to variations occurring in the\nIMF Bz component. These variations in the dynamic pres-\nsure and IMF Bz component are significantly correlated to\nobserved fluctuations in the brightness of the proton aurora\nand the magnitude of ionospheric flows in the cusp region.\n4. Discussion\n[25] Frey et al. [2003a] studied the proton auroral oval\nand dayside auroral spot observed on 17 September 2000,\nand showed that the proton auroral spot is observed con-\ntinuously for nearly four hours during this day. In this study\nwe have demonstrated that though the spot is continuously\npresent, conditions varied significantly during the interval in\na number of aspects. Even though the IMF is directed\nnorthward for the entire interval, it is the relative magni-\ntudes of the IMF By and Bz components that determine the\nnature of the dayside reconnection process. During the first\npart of the interval the IMF By component dominated the Bz\ncomponent. During this time we observed ionospheric\nconvection patterns consistent with low-latitude reconnec-\ntion occurring at the dayside magnetopause. Previous work\nby Provan et al. [2005] has demonstrated that during a\nsimilar interval of weakly northward IMF when a \u2018\u2018stan-\ndard\u2019\u2019 two-cell convection pattern was observed, lobe and\nlow-latitude reconnection were occurring simultaneously\n[Reiff and Burch, 1985], with a lobe cell observed in the\ncentre of the dusk convection cell. During the second part of\nthe interval the IMF Bz component dominated the By\ncomponent. At this time we observed a global high-latitude\nFigure 7.

(b) Stack plot of l-o-s velocities observed by beam 8\nof the Kapuskasing radar between 1600 and 1930 UT at ranges 44 to 47 (MLAT 77.1 to 78.3).\nA10211 PROVAN ET AL.: DAYSIDE RECONNECTION DURING NORTHWARD IMF\n9 of 13\nA10211\nFigure 8\nA10211 PROVAN ET AL.: DAYSIDE RECONNECTION DURING NORTHWARD IMF\n10 of 13\nA10211\nconvection pattern consistent with lobe merging occurring\nat the dayside magnetopause.\n[26] The proton auroral oval and dayside auroral spot\nwere observed during the entire interval. When low-latitude\nmerging was observed the proton auroral spot was observed\nwithin the auroral oval at a location we take to be the\nfootprint of the ionospheric cusp. When high-latitude merg-\ning was observed the auroral spot was observed poleward of\nthe auroral oval at the footprint of the high-latitude recon-\nnection site and cusp [Milan et al., 2000a; Fuselier et al.,\n2002]. The intensity of the proton auroral oval and spot was\nmuch enhanced during the interval when the high-latitude\nlobe merging occurred.\n[27] We have demonstrated that the intensity of the proton\nauroral spot varies with time both during intervals of lobe\nmerging and during intervals of low-latitude merging, with\nan average periodicity of \u000122 min. The variation in the\nintensity of the proton auroral spot is directly correlated to\nvariations in the magnitude of the flow velocity as observed\nby the SuperDARN radars, with the brightest proton auroral\nspot being observed when flow bursts are observed in the\ncusp region by the SuperDARN radars. Ionospheric flow\nbursts have previously been identified as the ionospheric\nsignatures of pulsed dayside reconnection occurring during\nintervals of low-latitude merging when the IMF points\nsouthward [e.g., Pinnock et al., 1995; Provan et al.,\n1998]. During the case study presented by Provan et al.\n[1998], the SuperDARN HF radar at lower latitudes ob-\nserved the flow bursts as poleward moving region of\nenhanced convection flows. At higher latitudes the pulsed\nflows were observed as poleward moving regions of back-\nscatter. Such poleward moving regions of backscatter, also\nidentified by Milan et al. [2000b] as a convection response\nto transient reconnection, are consistent with the observa-\ntions made here.\n[28] During interval A the flow bursts are observed\npoleward of the proton auroral spot, suggesting that these\nflow bursts may be consistent with the high-latitude flux\ntransfer events recently reported by Farrugia et al. [2004]\nand Thompson et al. [2004]. Farrugia et al. [2004] reported\nobserving pulsed flows poleward of the convection reversal\nboundary during an interval of negative IMF Bz, and\nsuggested that the high-latitude boundary layer downstream\nof the cusp might be an active site of momentum transfer.\nThompson et al. [2004] reported observing high-latitude\nflux transfer events in the northern dayside lobe poleward of\nthe cusp during an event when the IMF Bz component was\nnegative, and the Bx and BY components were the dominant\ncomponents of the IMF.\n[29] It is however possible that the observations of flow\nbursts poleward of the proton auroral spot may be related to\nan increase in the brightness of the proton auroral spot being\nassociated with a lack of radar backscatter and possibly a\ndeflection of ionospheric flow, with the increased plasma\nvelocities observed in the region surrounding the enhanced\nauroral brightness. Ionospheric flow deflection has previ-\nously been observed by Provan et al. [2004] while\nperforming a statistical study of high-latitude plasma flow\nduring magnetospheric substorms. The flows were deflected\naround a region of suppressed flow, which was tentatively\nidentified as the position of the auroral bulge. It was\nsuggested that the flow stagnation and deflection could be\ndue to the high electrical conductivity of the bulge iono-\nsphere compared with the surrounding region [e.g., Khan et\nal., 2001]. In the case study presented here there is no\nevidence of a flow suppression associated with the proton\nauroral spot, just a lack of radar backscatter. Further analysis\nis needed to determine whether this lack of radar backscatter\ncould be related to enhanced particle precipitation and\nincreased electrical conductivity associated with the proton\nspot.\n[30] Provan et al. [2005] reported observing signatures of\npulsed dayside reconnection both when simultaneous low-\nlatitude and lobe merging was occurring and also when only\nlobe reconnection was observed. During the interval studied\nhere we have observed solar wind pressure pulses with the\nquasiperiodic variation in the solar wind dynamic pressure\ndirectly correlated with fluctuations of the IMF Bz compo-\nnent, and found these pressure pulses to be directly corre-\nlated with fluctuations in the brightness of the auroral\nproton spot and with the high-latitude l-o-s velocities. Frey\net al. [2002] observed the proton auroral spot when the IMF\nhad a positive Bz component. They interpreted the proton\nspot as a direct signature of proton precipitation into the\ncusp after reconnection of magnetospheric lobe field lines.\nHowever, Frey et al. [2002] found that the intensity of the\nprecipitation was not controlled by the magnitude of the\nIMF Bz component but rather by the solar wind dynamic\npressure.\n[31] For the interval presented in this study it has not been\npossible to confidently determine whether it is the solar\nwind pressure or the IMF Bz component, or both, which are\nmodulating the auroral intensity, as these two parameters are\nsignificantly correlated with each other as well as with the\nfluctuations in the auroral intensity. However, it is worth\nnoting that the correlation coefficient between the auroral\nbrightness and the IMF Bz is \u00010.6, which is clearly larger\nthan the correlation coefficient between the auroral bright-\nness and the solar wind pressure (r \u0001 0.43). The pulsed\nnature of the ionospheric flow signatures demonstrate that\nthe dayside reconnection rate is also being modulated. It is\nvery interesting to note that the solar wind dynamic pressure\nFigure 8.

The intensity\nof the proton auroral spot has an average periodicity of\n\u000122 min, almost half the periodicity of the of the solar wind\ndynamic pressure. This would suggest that the intensity of\nthe proton auroral spot is positively correlated with both the\nmaxima and minima in the solar wind dynamic pressure.\nHowever, although the correlation coefficient between the\nauroral brightness and solar wind dynamic pressure shows\npeaks at lag times of approximately \u000310 and approximately\n27 min, these peaks were not found to be significant.\nClearly, more work needs to be done in this area.\n[32] We hypothesize that the dayside reconnection rate\ncan be modulated both by variations in the IMF Bz\ncomponent, and by changes in the solar wind dynamic\npressure. Increases in the dynamic pressure would compress\nthe magnetosphere and magnetotail and thus enhance the\nreconnection rate. This has previously been reported by\nFarrugia et al. [1995], who presented a case study of\nground based optical observations for an interval when\nthe IMF Bz \u0001 0 and IMF By \u0004 0. They observed auroral\ntransients at the poleward edge of a latitudinally narrow\nzone of persistent auroral emission. They also observed a\ntwin cell flow pattern with superimposed flow perturba-\ntions, and a sequence of magnetic impulses at ground\nstations around the optical sites which were correlated with\nthe auroral transients. The authors found that the auroral\ntransients were correlated with the arrival at the Earth of a\nsequence upstream solar wind pressure pulses. They inter-\npreted their observations as being due to increases in the\ndynamic pressure at the dayside magnetopause which\nenhances the reconnection rate there. Sandholt et al.\n[1994] observed auroral transients and ground magnetic\nsignatures of enhanced convection during an interval of\nnegative IMF By and Bz. These transient signatures were\nalso correlated with brief pulses in the solar wind dynamic\npressure. However, enhancements in the auroral intensity\ncan also be due to the enhancements in the plasma density\nresulting in increased precipitation of charged particles into\nthe auroral region.\n[33] This study leaves one crucial question unanswered:\nis dayside reconnection occurring at a weaker rate between\nthese bursts of strong reconnection or does it stop entirely?\nPrevious research by Cowley and Lockwood [1992] sug-\ngests that the flow excited by an impulsive reconnection\nevent grows and decays with a timescale of the order of\n10 min. The fact that the magnitude of the l-o-s velocity\noften increases by at least a factor of two during the flow\nbursts, indicates that the pulsations are very powerful.\nThus it may well be that the weaker plasma flows\nobserved between the flow pulsations, are driven by the\nstrong flow bursts. Further research is needed to examine\nthe timescale over which plasma flows and aurora excited\nby dayside reconnection decays below observable values.\n5. Summary\n[34] In this paper we have presented a case study\nconcerning the proton auroral spot and conjugate iono-\nspheric flows during one interval of prolonged northward\nIMF. During the first part of the interval the IMF By\ncomponent dominated the Bz component and ionospheric\nflow patterns consistent with low-latitude merging occur-\nring at the dayside magnetopause were observed. During\nthe second part of the interval the IMF Bz component\ndominated the By component and we observed ionospheric\nflow patterns consistent with high-latitude lobe merging\noccurring. Throughout the interval we observed periodic\nfluctuations in the brightness of the proton auroral spot and\ncorrelated bursts of plasma flow. Simultaneously solar wind\npressure pulses were observed, with fluctuations in the\nsolar wind dynamic pressure correlated with variations in\nthe IMF Bz component. The solar wind dynamic pressure\nand the IMF Bz component were both significantly corre-\nlated to the fluctuations in the plasma velocity and to the\nvariations in the brightness of the proton auroral spot. The\nobservations are consistent with the dayside reconnection\nrate and ionospheric precipitation being modulated by\nvariations in the solar wind dynamic pressure and the\nIMF Bz component.\n[35] Acknowledgments.
