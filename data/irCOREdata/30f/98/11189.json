Both V-S and MACEP\nconvection models predict a very asymmetric local time distribution of ring current energy\ndensity during the main and early recovery phase of the storm. However, the peak of the\nmedium energy ions is located during the main phase near midnight when the MACEP\nmodel is used, while it is located near dusk using V-S. In both models the energy density\npeak is located near dusk during the early recovery, and the ring current becomes\nsymmetric during the late recovery phase. Ring current injection is larger, penetrating to\nlower L shells, and the Dst index is significantly better reproduced using MACEP rather\nthan using V-S model.

Introduction\n[2] Amajor scientific goal of the national \u2018\u2018space weather\u2019\u2019\nprogram is to be able to predict strong geomagnetic\ndisturbances since enhanced energetic particle fluxes and\ninduced currents could damage satellites and endanger\nhuman life in space. A thorough understanding of the\nprocesses that operate in the inner magnetosphere is nec-\nessary to achieve this goal. New remote satellite measure-\nments enabling to \u2018\u2018image\u2019\u2019 the energetic ion population and\nto study ring current morphology during storms demon-\nstrate the complexity of this problem. Part of the NASA\nExplorer Program, the IMAGE Mission [Burch, 2000]\nprovides global multi-spectral images of the Earth\u2019s inner\nmagnetosphere at time scales of few minutes and is able to\ncapture the dynamics of geomagnetic storms. Energetic ions\ncharge exchange with low-energy neutrals from the geo-\ncorona and produce energetic neutral atoms (ENA) that are\nimaged by the low (LENA) [Moore et al., 2001], medium\n(MENA) [Pollock et al., 2001], and high (HENA) [Mitchell\net al., 2001] imagers. These observations provide an\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 108, NO.

An evolution\nfrom a compact, asymmetric ring current during the storm\nmain phase to an expanded and more symmetric one during\nlate recovery phase was thus observed [Pollock et al., 2001].\nMitchell et al. [2001] found that during a major storm the ion\ninjection penetrated deeper into the magnetosphere (L \u0001\n3 RE), while during a small storm the injection was restricted\nto a region much further from Earth. Burch et al. [2001]\nreported simultaneous global observations of the plasma-\nsphere and the ring current which showed the peak of the\nring current to be nearly centered at the plasmapause. The ring\ncurrent images from HENA near minimum Dst indicated\nsignificant precipitation near dusk overlapping with the\nplasmapause. This was the first global simultaneous obser-\nvation of the spatial relationship between the ring current, the\nplasmapause, and the associated ion precipitation. Energetic\nneutral atom images were recently reported from the Swedish\nmicrosatellite Astrid-1 by C:son Brandt et al. [2002]. This\nsatellite was launched in a polar, 1000 km orbit and carried an\nENA imager to observe the ring current from a low-altitude\nvantage point at the equator. Images in the energy range 26\u2013\n37 keV taken from below the ring current at MLT = 3 showed\na narrow region of intense ENA emissions in the postmid-\nnight local time sector. Several possible scenario that may\nexplain the origin of this plasma and require further investi-\ngation were suggested.\n[3] Global numerical modeling is a powerful tool for\nunderstanding the complexity of a highly dynamical region\nsuch as the near-Earth space environment. Such modeling\nhas demonstrated that the major mechanism controlling ring\ncurrent evolution is the time-varying convection electric\nfield [e.g., Jordanova et al., 1998, 2001b]. Other processes\ncontributing to ring current buildup are radial diffusion\n[e.g., Chen et al., 1994, 1997] and substorm-induced\nelectric field [e.g., Fok et al., 1996; Wolf et al., 1997];\nhowever, they affect mostly the high-energy particles and\nhave smaller effect on ring current injection. The enhanced\ncross-tail convection electric field during the main phase of\na storm transports newly injected particles from the mag-\nnetotail earthward, accelerates them, and increases the\npreexisting ring current energy density. A simple analytical\nform of the inner magnetospheric convection model was\nobtained by Volland [1973] and Stern [1975], which was\nmade time-dependent through the 3 hour averaged planetary\nKp index byMaynard and Chen [1975]. Using this model, a\nreasonable agreement between model predicted total energy\ncontent of the ring current and subsequently calculated Dst\nusing the Dessler-Parker-Sckopke relation [Dessler and\nParker, 1959; Sckopke, 1966] with the measured Dst index\nwas reported [Jordanova et al., 1998; Kozyra et al., 1998;\nLiemohn et al., 1999]. Detailed comparison of modeled ring\ncurrent distributions with measured spectra, however,\nshowed pronounced differences at lower L shells [Kistler\net al., 1999; Jordanova et al., 1999a]. Recent in situ\nobservations from the electric field instrument on CRRES\n[Wygant et al., 1998; Rowland and Wygant, 1998] indicated\nthe presence of strong electric fields at low L during storm\ntime, which differ significantly from the Volland-Stern\nmodel. The Volland-Stern model gives a realistic descrip-\ntion of the overall potential drop across the magnetosphere,\nbut does not take into account the rapid temporal and spatial\nvariations of the magnetospheric electric field during peri-\nods of high geomagnetic activity.\n[4] In this study, we develop our ring current model further\nimplementing a more complex electric field model based on\nthe assimilative mapping of ionospheric electrodynamics\n(AMIE) [Richmond, 1992] with the addition of a penetration\nelectric field. The ionospheric electric potential obtained\nwith the AMIE procedure involves the synthesis of\nground-based and satellite data. During the 10 January\n1997 storm we investigate, the AMIE input included data\nfrom six SuperDARN radars, NOAA, DMSP, and Polar\nsatellites, and 119 ground magnetometers [Lu et al., 1998;\nBoonsiriseth et al., 2001]. This allowed the electric field to\nbe specified with excellent spatial resolution on time scales\n(\u00015 minute) sufficient to follow ring current storm time\ndynamics. We simulate ring current evolution during the 10\nJanuary storm and show the effect of the spatial and temporal\nvariability of the convection electric field on ring current\nbuildup and decay, morphology, and ion precipitation. This\nstudy is meant as a contribution to the development of\npredictive \u2018\u2018space weather\u2019\u2019 models, a primary objective of\nthe NASA\u2019s SEC Division and is relevant to the analysis\nof the new data sets from the IMAGE Mission.\n2. Modeling Ring Current Dynamics\n2.1. Transport of Ring Current Particles\n[5] The interaction of the January 1997 magnetic cloud\nwith Earth was a well-studied International Solar Terrestrial\nPhysics (ISTP) event and the interplanetary conditions were\ndescribed in detail by Burlaga et al. [1998] and Farrugia et\nal. [1998]. An interplanetary shock was detected by the\ninstruments on Wind at \u00011 UT, 10 January. It was driven by\na magnetic cloud with a negative to positive IMF Bz polarity\nvariation inside the cloud and minimum at \u00017:30 UT,\n10 January. The passage at Earth of this magnetic cloud\ninduced a storm of moderate intensity with minimum Dst =\n\u000283 nT at \u000110 UT, 10 January, and maximum Kp = 6. The\nmain phase of the storm coincided with the first \u00014 hours of\ncloud passage.\n[6] We investigate the spatial and temporal development\nof the ring current ion population during this storm employ-\ning our global drift-loss model briefly summarized below.\nThe dynamics of energetic charged particles of species\nl under the conditions of time-varying magnetospheric\nelectric field and a dipole model of the Earth\u2019s magnetic\nfield are studied by solving numerically the bounce-aver-\naged kinetic equation for the phase space distribution\nfunction Ql [Jordanova et al., 1996a, 1997]:\n@Ql\n@t\n\u00fe 1\nR2o\n@\n@Ro\nR2o\ndRo\ndt\n\u0001 \u0002\nQl\n\u0003 \u0004\n\u00fe @\n@f\ndf\ndt\n\u0001 \u0002\nQl\n\u0003 \u0004\n\u00fe 1ffiffiffi\nE\np @\n@E\nffiffiffi\nE\np dE\ndt\n\u0001 \u0002\nQl\n\u0003 \u0004\n\u00fe 1\nh mo\u00f0 \u00demo\n@\n@mo\nh mo\u00f0 \u00demo\ndmo\ndt\n\u0001 \u0002\nQl\n\u0003 \u0004\n\u00bc @Ql\n@t\n\u0003 \u0004\nce\n\u0001 \u0002\n\u00fe @Ql\n@t\n\u0003 \u0004\ncc\n\u0001 \u0002\n\u00fe @Ql\n@t\n\u0003 \u0004\nwp\n* +\n\u00fe @Ql\n@t\n\u0003 \u0004\natm\n\u0001 \u0002\n\u00f01\u00de\nHere the loss term on the right-hand side includes\ncontributions from charge exchange with exospheric\nhydrogen, Coulomb collisions with thermal plasma, wave-\nSMP 15 - 2 JORDANOVA ET AL.: RING CURRENT ASYMMETRY\nparticle interactions, and absorption of ring current particles\nat low altitude in the atmosphere. The distributions of H+,\nHe+, and O+ ions are calculated as function of time t, kinetic\nenergy E from 15 eV to 400 keV, equatorial pitch angle ao\nfrom 0\u0004 to 90\u0004, where mo = cos(ao), radial distance in the\nequatorial plane Ro from 2 RE to 6.5 RE, and all magnetic\nlocal times (MLT) with geomagnetic longitude f = 0 at\nmidnight.\n[7] The magnetospheric plasma inflow on the nightside is\nmodeled using energetic flux measurements made by the\nLANL spacecraft at geosynchronous orbit. This assumes\nthat ionospheric ions are injected into the equatorial mag-\nnetosphere at larger distances. Direct ionospheric injection\nat low L < 6.5 shells has minor contribution [e.g., Chappell\net al., 1987] and will be investigated in future studies.\nDuring the investigated period, the storm time plasma sheet\nfluxes were enhanced in comparison with the prestorm\nvalues, however, plasma sheet ion density remained below\n1 cm\u00023 [Thomsen et al., 1998; Jordanova et al., 1999b].\nThere was thus no evidence of superdense plasma sheet\n[Borovsky et al., 1997] during this storm.\n[8] Our model has been employed in the past to investi-\ngate various aspects of ring current dynamics during several\ngeomagnetic storms [e.g., Jordanova et al., 1997, 2001a;\nKozyra et al., 1997, 1998; Liemohn et al., 1999, 2000;\nFarrugia et al., 2003]. One of the most widely used inner\nmagnetospheric electric field models, the semiempirical\nconvection and corotation model of Volland-Stern [Volland,\n1973; Stern, 1975; Maynard and Chen, 1975] was first\nimplemented in our ring current model [Jordanova et al.,\n1996a]. However, the convection potential in this model is\nparameterized only by the 3-hour planetary Kp index. One\npoint which emerged from the above studies was that\nalthough much insight and many successes were achieved\nusing an analytical Volland-Stern type model, significant\ndiscrepancies between model results and observations\nremained, since while capturing the gross temporal evolu-\ntion of the large-scale potential drop across the magneto-\nsphere, Volland-Stern model was not able to reproduce the\nhighly variable and relatively small-scale features of the\ninner magnetospheric electric field during storm time [e.g.,\nRowland and Wygant, 1998; Boonsiriseth et al., 2001]. To\nobtain the way the plasma convection responds to rapid\nchanges in the interplanetary magnetic field and solar wind,\nwe develop our ring current model further implementing an\nelectric potential model with increased spatial and temporal\nresolution based on the AMIE [Richmond, 1992] iono-\nspheric potentials.\n[9] A detailed study of inner magnetospheric convection\nduring the January1997 stormwasperformedbyBoonsiriseth\net al. [2001]. As discussed in the introduction, the AMIE\nmodel uses input of data from a variety of sources. During\nthis storm, the data coverage was very good at high latitudes\n(65\u0004 to 90\u0004). At mid-latitudes, where the data coverage was\nlimited, the potential patterns were mainly generated on the\nbasis of a statistical model [Foster et al., 1986] or extrapo-\nlated from adjacent data. To improve the limitations of\nAMIE model, Boonsiriseth et al. [2001] have added an\nasymmetric ring current driven penetration electric field\n[Ridley and Liemohn, 2002]. This subauroral ionospheric\nelectric field is caused by the partial ring current closure in\nthe ionosphere during storm time and is often associated\nwith subauroral polarization streams (SAPS) [Foster and\nBurke, 2002]. The modified AMIE convection electric\npotentials (MACEP) thus obtained agreed well with in situ\nmeasurements of thermal ion velocities from LANL satel-\nlites and data from the electric field instrument (EFI) on\nPolar. Figure 1 displays the convection potentials mapped to\nthe equatorial plane during the prestorm, main, and recovery\nphase of the 10 January storm without (MACEP-) and with\n(MACEP) the addition of the penetration electric field to\nAMIE model. It is evident that the effect of this field is most\nFigure 1. Comparison of MACEP (AMIE convection electric potentials mapped to the equatorial plane\nusing Tsyganenko [1996] model) in the corotation frame (top) without and (bottom) with the addition of\nan asymmetric ring current driven penetration electric field. Potentials are shown at selected hours after\n00 UT, 10 January 1997.\nJORDANOVA ET AL.: RING CURRENT ASYMMETRY SMP 15 - 3\nimportant during the main phase of the storm and it acts to\nintensify the duskside and nightside convection electric\nfield, with slight modification of the dawnside convection\n(for a more detailed analysis of this effect, please review\nBoonsiriseth et al. [2001]).\n[10] Figure 2 shows the temporal and spatial evolution of\nthe modified AMIE potentials mapped to the equatorial\nplane (MACEP) using the Tsyganenko [1996] magnetic\nfield model. The equatorial potentials of the Kp-dependent\nVolland-Stern model with a shielding factor g = 2 and zero\noffset are plotted for comparison. The Dst index of the\nJanuary 1997 storm is shown for reference. It is clear that\nthe temporal evolution of the large-scale features is similar in\nboth convection models which predict the largest electric\npotentials during the main phase of the storm (hour 8).\nDetailed comparison, however, indicates that MACEPmodel\nshows highly variable small-scale features not present in the\nVolland-Stern convection model. The analytical Volland-\nStern model is day-night symmetric by definition, while\nMACEP patterns are quite irregular and skewed on the\nnightside. The Volland-Stern model implies an increase of\nthe large-scale electric field at all L shells to \u00011\u20132 mV\/m,\nwhile the MACEP model predicts strong and localized\nelectric field of \u00013 mV\/m at lower L \b 3 shells near dusk;\nthe MACEP electric field decreased to\u00011 mV\/m at L = 5. As\ndiscussed above a strong penetrating electric field was mea-\nsured along the duskside outbound Polar pass by the EFI\ninstrument during the storm main phase, in agreement with\nthe MACEPmodel. Similar intensifications of the storm time\nelectric field on the nightside, in the dusk-midnight quadrant,\nare predicted by self-consistent electric field calculations\nusing Rice Convection Model [Harel et al., 1981; Wolf,\n1983; Fok et al., 2001].\n2.2. Loss of Ring Current Ions\n[11] All important loss processes are included in our ring\ncurrent model. Charge exchange causes ring current ion\nneutralization due to collision with thermal exospheric\nhydrogen atoms and such losses are included in our model\nusing the hydrogen geocoronal density of Rairden et al.\n[1986]. Coulomb collisions between energetic ring current\nions and thermal plasma cause energy transfer from ener-\ngetic particles to the thermal particles and pitch-angle\nscattering. The resulting changes in the ring current ion\ndistributions are calculated with the Fokker-Planck equa-\ntion. The plasmaspheric electron densities are obtained\nwith the coupled time-dependent plasmasphere model of\nRasmussen et al. [1993]. The thermal (1 eV) ion composi-\ntion ratio is assumed to be 77% H+, 20% He+, and 3% O+.\nRing current particles with small pitch angles mirror at low\naltitudes and encounter the dense atmosphere. The removal\nof particles mirroring below a certain altitude (200 km in our\nmodel) is included, introducing a loss term with a timescale\nof half of a bounce period. Loss of particles drifting through\nthe dayside magnetopause is taken into account by allowing\nfree ion outflow from the dayside boundaries.\n[12] Another very complex loss mechanism is scattering\nof ions into the atmospheric loss cone (i.e., pitch angle\nisotropization of the distribution function) due to resonant\ninteractions with plasma waves. To include a self-consistent\ntreatment of wave-particle interactions in our model, we\ncalculate the excitation of electromagnetic ion cyclotron\n(EMIC) waves in the equatorial plane as a function of\nmagnetic local time and L shell with storm development.\nThe convective growth rates S are obtained from the hot\nplasma dispersion relation [e.g., Gomberoff and Neira,\n1983; Kozyra et al., 1984]:\nS \u00bc gw\nVg\n\u00bc y\u00f0nl;Ek;l ;Al\u00de \u00f02\u00de\nwhich is coupled and solved simultaneously with the ring\ncurrent and plasmasphere models as the storm evolves.\nHere gw is the temporal growth rate, Vg is the group\nvelocity, and y is a functional of the local hot and cold\nplasma parameters. The density nl, parallel energy E,l, and\ntemperature anisotropy Al of the ring current H\n+, O+, and\nHe+ ion species in equation (2) are calculated by taking\nmoments of the distribution functions Ql obtained from\nequation (1). EMIC waves grow for gw > 0, otherwise wave\ndamping occurs; the superposition of the growth or\ndamping rates due to each individual ring current ion\nspecies determines whether waves are excited in the multi-\nion plasma. We integrate the convective growth rates S\nalong wave paths which are field-aligned and extend over\n\u00b15\u0004 magnetic latitude (\u00b110\u0004 at the plasmapause) to obtain\nthe wave gain G [Thorne and Horne, 1997; Kozyra et al.,\n1997]. Since information on the background noise level\nfrom which the waves grow is not available, we relate\ncalculated wave gain with measured wave amplitudes on\nthe basis of statistical studies [e.g., Braysy et al., 1998]\nusing\nBw\u00f0nT\u00de \u00bc 10\n 10\u00f0G\u0002Gmax\u00de=Gmin \u00f03\u00de\nWave-particle interactions are neglected if Bw < 0.1 nT,\nwhile Bw = 10 nT is used for G \u000b Gmax when the wave\namplitudes saturate [Jordanova et al., 2001a].\n[13] The effect of wave-particle interactions on ring current\nion distributions is treated in themodel following quasi-linear\ntheory as a diffusive process. A distinctive feature of our\nmodel is the use of diffusion coefficients which consider the\npresence of heavy ions in the plasma [Jordanova et al.,\n1996b]. In a multi-ion plasma, EMICwaves do not propagate\nin the frequency range between the ion gyrofrequency and the\ncutoff frequency for each ion component but form multiple\nstop bands. For most of the wave frequencies of interest,\nparticles in a multicomponent plasma resonate at lower\nparallel energies for a given harmonic value. The scattering\nat lower energies (approximately tens of keV) enhances the\nion precipitation losses from the ring current during geomag-\nnetic storms. We calculate the diffusion coefficients using the\nwave amplitude model described above (equation (3)) with\ngrowth rates obtained from equation (2) and the effects on the\ndistribution function using the Boltzmann equation (1); these\nequations are solved simultaneously and self-consistency of\nthe model is thus achieved. The average ion flux in the loss\ncone is calculated for given energy ranges and global images\nof precipitating fluxes are obtained as the storm develops.\n3.

Measurements of the energetic\nparticle distributions during 9\u201311 January 1997 are provided\nby the instruments on Polar spacecraft which followed an\norbit in the dawn-dusk meridian during this storm of\nmoderate intensity. The spectra measured by the HYDRA\n[Scudder et al., 1995], TIMAS [Shelley et al., 1995], and\nCAMMICE [Chen et al., 1998] instruments during the\nprestorm quiet day of 9 January [Jordanova et al., 1999b]\nare used as initial conditions in our model.\n[15] Global images of the energy density calculations for\nthe major ring current ion species H+ as function of radial\ndistance in the equatorial plane and MLT are shown in\nFigures 3 and 4at several representative UT during the\nstorm. Simulations for low (15\u201330 keV), medium (30\u2013\n80 keV), and high (80\u2013200 keV) energy ranges using\nMACEP model (Figure 3) are compared with simulations\nusing Volland-Stern model (Figure 4). Similar morphology\nis observed with both models during the prestorm quiet\nconditions at 04 UT, 10 January (Figures 3a and 4a),\nFigure 3. Dial plots of proton ring current energy density in (keV\/cm3) for several energy ranges as a\nfunction of radial distance in the equatorial plane and magnetic local time using MACEP model at\n(a) 04 UT, (b) 08 UT, (c) 10 UT, and (d) 24 UT, 10 January.\nSMP 15 - 6 JORDANOVA ET AL.: RING CURRENT ASYMMETRY\nshowing initial ring current injection at high L shells on the\nduskside. As the main phase of the storm proceeds, ions are\ntransported earthward and energized. The low-energy pop-\nulation drifts eastward, while the high-energy population\nsurrounds the Earth westward; a very asymmetric ring\ncurrent energy distributions develop and significant differ-\nences between the two models occur. The MACEP electric\nfield model penetrates earthward during the main phase of\nthe storm and has larger magnitude than the Volland-Stern\nmodel. This results in larger ring current injection and\nstronger asymmetry when MACEP model is used. The\nfreshly injected 30\u201380 keV ring current ions on open drift\npaths during the main phase penetrate to L \u0001 3 and the ring\ncurrent energy density intensifies from premidnight to\npostmidnight and reaches maximum of \u0001170 keV\/cm3 at\nL = 3.75 at MLT = 1 (Figure 3b). Note that there is a factor\nof \u000110 variation in the H+ intensity with MLT. At the\nsame time, the 30\u201380 keV ring current ions penetrate to L\n\u00013.5 in Volland-Stern model and their energy density\nintensifies from postnoon to premidnight and maximizes\nto \u000180 keV\/cm3 at L \u00014.25 at MLT = 17 (Figure 4b).\nTherefore the peak is rotated \u000190\u0004 westward in Volland-\nStern compared to MACEP, reflecting the rotation of the\nconvection patterns. Larger energy gain is observed as well\nin the higher and lower (Figure 3b) ring current energy\ncomponents in MACEP compared to Volland-Stern\n(Figure 4b) model. The deeper penetration of ring current\nions and the location of the energy density peak near\nmidnight predicted with MACEP are in better agreement\nwith recent ENA observations during storm time from the\nIMAGE satellite [e.g.,Mitchell et al., 2001; C:son Brandt et\nal., 2002] than Volland-Stern predictions. This morphology,\nFigure 4. Same as Figure 3 using Volland-Stern model.\nJORDANOVA ET AL.: RING CURRENT ASYMMETRY SMP 15 - 7\nhowever, lasts only for few hours. Near minimum Dst\n(Figures 3c and 4c) the ring current energy density peak is\nlocated in the premidnight quadrant in both models. At this\ntime ring current ions penetrate to L \u0001 2.5 in MACEP, while\nthey remain at L \u000b 3 in Volland-Stern near dusk. During the\nrecovery phase of the storm the convection electric field\ndecreases in both models and causes particles to move from\nopen to closed drift paths and to become trapped. Particles\nthat are not trapped escape trough the dayside boundary. The\ntrapped population evolves into a symmetric ring current\nduring the late recovery phase (Figures 3d and 4d).\n[16] The ring current contribution to Dst index calculated\nfrom our model using the Dessler-Parker-Sckopke relation\n[Dessler and Parker, 1959; Sckopke, 1966] is compared\nwith measured Dst in Figure 5. The 18-station measured\nDst* values (5 minute averages) for 10\u201311 January are\nshown by the starred line. In order to isolate the ring current\ncontribution to Dst variations, we correct the measured Dst\nvalues for disturbed and quiet magnetopause currents, as\nwell as currents induced in the solid Earth [Jordanova et al.,\n1999b]. The five vertical guidelines mark important times\nrelated to the January magnetic cloud. From left to right:\nThe arrival of the interplanetary shock at WIND, the cloud\nfront boundary, the Bz minimum inside the cloud, the Bz\nnegative to positive polarity transition, and the rear bound-\nary of the cloud. The calculated Dst* using MACEP (solid\nline) and Volland-Stern (dashed line) models illustrate the\neffect of the magnetospheric electric field on ring current\nformation and decay. The dashed-dotted line is obtained\nusing MACEP and assuming 15% self energy of the ring\ncurrent magnetic field [Carovillano and Siscoe, 1973]. As\ndiscussed above, the MACEP model injects particles deeper\nin the near-Earth region and causes larger energization, thus\npredicts \u000140% larger jDstj values than Volland-Stern during\nthe main phase. Minimum Dst* is predicted by MACEP\nabout 3 hours after Bz minimum is observed inside the\ncloud. Although our model does not resolve the small-scale\nDst* fluctuations, model predictions using MACEP follow\nthe large-scale temporal variations of the observed Dst* and\nreproduce the ring current growth rate during the main\nphase as well as the decay rate during the recovery phase\nremarkably well.\n4. Comparisons With Polar Observations\n[17] During the January 1997 storm Polar satellite, which\norbits in a highly inclined, elliptical trajectory with a period\nof 17.5 hours and an apogee at \u00019 RE over the northern\nhemisphere and a perigee at \u00012 RE over the southern\nhemisphere, followed an orbit nearly along the dawn-dusk\nmeridian. The time intervals when Polar was in the inner\nmagnetosphere and are of interest to this study are shown\nwith horizontal bars in Figure 5. We use data from the\nfollowing Polar instruments: The hot plasma experiment\nHYDRA measuring the three-dimensional ion distribution\nfrom \u000115 eV to \u000120 keV, the ion mass spectrometer\nTIMAS covering the energy range from \u000125 eV to\n\u000125 keV, and the ion composition spectrometer CAMMICE\nfrom \u00011 to \u0001200 keV. We compare distribution functions\ncalculated with MACEP (solid line) or Volland-Stern (dash-\ndot line) models with HYDRA (diamonds), TIMAS (trian-\ngles) and CAMMICE (squares) observations during the main\nphase of the storm in Figure 6. Representative data of the H+,\nHe+, and O+ distribution functions from the near-equatorial\ninbound Polar pass at \u00010600 UT (Figures 6a and 6b) and\nfrom the outbound pass at \u00010930 UT (Figures 6c and 6d)\nwhen the instruments had good spatial resolution are\nshown. The data are obtained during time intervals of\n\u000112 s (two spin periods) when Polar was at a given L\nshell and are averaged over the locally mirroring pitch angle\nrange a = 75\u0004 \u00b1 15\u0004. Modeled distributions are mapped\nalong magnetic field lines to the position of the spacecraft\nconserving the first and second adiabatic invariants. Both\nmodels reproduce reasonably well the data on the dawnside\n(Figures 6a and 6b) and at large L shells on the duskside\n(Figure 6d). Significant differences between the two models\nare seen at lower L shells near dusk (Figure 6c). The\nstronger convection electric field of MACEP model injects\nparticles to L \r 3.5 during the main phase of the storm and\nenergizes them, which results in larger distributions than the\nones obtained with Volland-Stern model. In particular, the\nincrease of the low energy H+ distribution is significantly\nbetter reproduced when MACEP model is used.\n[18] The imaging proton sensor (IPS) of the comprehen-\nsive energetic particles and pitch angle distribution (CEP-\nPAD) experiment [Blake et al., 1995] on Polar obtained\nmeasurement of the ion pitch angle distributions during the\nJanuary storm. Data from three consecutive southern hemi-\nsphere passes near perigee at local times near dawn\n(MLT \b 6) and dusk (MLT \b 18) are shown for \u000120 keV\n(Figure 7) and \u000165 keV (Figure 8). The data shown are\nindividual count rates obtained as a function of ion pitch\nangle on each satellite spin and binned here over a range\nL \u00b1 0.25. During the southern perigee passes the IPS\ninstrument was able to resolve the pitch angle distribution\nin the vicinity of the atmospheric loss cone, here identified\nwith vertical guidelines. Precipitating ions in the upward\nlooking loss cone have pitch angles between a \u0001160\u0004 and\nFigure 5.

The periods when Polar was at\n2 < L < 7 are shown with horizontal bars.\nSMP 15 - 8 JORDANOVA ET AL.: RING CURRENT ASYMMETRY\nFigure 6. Comparison of locally mirroring H+, He+ and O+ ion distribution functions (s3\/km6)\ncalculated using Volland-Stern (dashed-dotted line) or MACEP (solid line) convection models with Polar\ndata at various L shells and magnetic latitudes.\nJORDANOVA ET AL.: RING CURRENT ASYMMETRY SMP 15 - 9\n180\u0004. The three passes shown occurred during the prestorm\n(day 9), main (day 10) and recovery (day 11) phase of the\nstorm. There is no significant ion scattering during the\nprestorm pass; the loss cone is empty both at dawn and\ndusk (Figures 7 and 8, circles). During the main phase of the\nstorm on 10 January ion pitch angle distributions at dusk\nbecome isotropic within the loss cone for L \u000b 4 (Figures 7\nand 8, right, plus symbols), indicating strong pitch angle\nscattering. During the recovery phase on 11 January par-\ntially filled loss cones are observed at dusk for L \u000b 4.5,\nindicating moderate diffusion (Figures 7 and 8, right,\ntriangles). In contrast, the loss cones at dawn remain empty\nduring the entire storm period (Figures 7 and 8, left).\n[19] The inclusion of pitch angle dependence in our\nmodel allows to take into account the process of pitch angle\nscattering and to calculate global patterns of ion precipita-\ntion. To this end, we integrate the average flux in the loss\ncone over given energy range as described by Jordanova et\nal. [1996a, 1997] and plot the total ion precipitating flux as\na function of L and MLT. Global images of proton precip-\nitation calculated with our model as the storm evolves using\neither MACEP or Volland-Stern convection model are\nshown in Figures 9 and 10, respectively. Note that the Polar\norbit is approximately along the dawn-dusk axis on these\nplots. Ion precipitation when wave-particle interactions are\nnot included (due mostly to convection in the assumed\nmagnetospheric electric field [see Jordanova et al., 1996a,\n1997]) as well as ion precipitation when scattering by He+\nband EMIC waves is included are shown, to isolate the\neffect of wave-particle interactions which drives the distri-\nbution function toward pitch angle isotropy. A small inten-\nsification due to plasma wave scattering is seen initially at\nhour 3 near midnight in both MACEP (Figure 9b, top) and\nVolland-Stern (Figure 10b, top) simulations. The precipita-\ntion intensifies as well at L = 6 near dusk in MACEP. EMIC\nwaves are predominantly excited just inside the plasma-\nsphere and along the plasmapause near Dst minimum and\nhave larger wave gain when MACEP model is used; there is\nno significant EMIC waves excitation predicted by Volland-\nStern model during this period. The precipitating proton\nflux is thus significantly enhanced by EMIC waves scatter-\ning and in good agreement with the strong diffusion seen in\nIPS data at L = 4 to 5 near dusk during the main phase of\nthe storm (Figure 9b, middle) when the MACEP model is\nused. There is no significant pitch angle diffusion and no\nincrease in the precipitating flux which remains \u00013 orders\nof magnitude smaller when Volland-Stern model is used\n(Figure 10b, middle). During the late recovery phase\n(hour 25), weak diffusion near dusk due to plasma wave\nscattering is seen at L \u00015 only using MACEP model\n(Figure 9b, bottom). These results indicate that 1) the\nintense precipitation at 4 \r L \r 5 observed by the IPS\ninstrument is well predicted by He+ band EMIC wave\nscattering using the MACEP convection model, and 2) an\nFigure 7.

Conclusions\n[20] We studied ring current dynamics during the moder-\nate geomagnetic storm of 10 January 1997, comparing ring\ncurrent evolution from two models of inner magnetospheric\nconvection: (a) the Kp-dependent Volland-Stern [Volland,\n1973; Stern, 1975] model and (b) a model based on the\nAMIE ionospheric potentials with the addition of an asym-\nmetric ring current driven penetration electric field at low\nmagnetic latitudes [Boonsiriseth et al., 2001]. We mapped\nthe improved AMIE ionospheric electric potentials to the\nequatorial plane using the Tsyganenko [1996] magnetic field\nmodel, and coupled the resulting equatorial potentials\n(MACEP) with our ring current model. As boundary con-\nditions for our kinetic drift-loss model we used energetic\nparticle data from Los Alamos geosynchronous spacecraft.\nWe compared model results with particle data from the\nHYDRA, TIMAS, CAMMICE, and IPS instruments on\nPolar.\n[21] The major findings from this work are as follows.\n[22] 1) While the temporal evolution of the large-scale\nfeatures was similar in both convection models, detailed\ncomparison indicated that MACEP model shows highly\nvariable small-scale features not present in the Volland-\nStern convection model. The electric field model based on\nthe AMIE ionospheric potentials that we have developed\npenetrated earthward in the dusk-midnight region during the\nmain phase of the storm and had larger magnitude than the\nVolland-Stern model, in agreement with satellite electric\nfield measurements. As a result, ring current ions penetrated\nabout \u0001 L = 0.5 deeper near Earth and their energy density\nwas about twice larger using MACEP, thus reproducing the\nrapidity of the main phase growth and its strength better.\nThe jDst*j index was enhanced by \u000140% using MACEP\nand reproduced significantly better the observations.\n[23] 2) Strong ring current asymmetry during storm main\nphase and early recovery phase was obtained with both\nmodels. Ring current simulations using the MACEP electric\nfield model demonstrated a variable location of the energy\ndensity peak during storm main phase on the nightside\nextending from premidnight to postmidnight, contrary to the\nclassical picture of an energy density peak near dusk\npredicted by the simplified Volland-Stern model and in\nbetter agreement with recent ENA observations from IM-\nAGE. Ring current energy density was located near dusk in\nboth models during the recovery phase and evolved into a\nsymmetric distribution during late recovery.\n[24] 3) Both Volland-Stern and MACEP models repro-\nduced very well the features in HYDRA, TIMAS, and\nCAMMICE data for all three ions near dawn at \u000106 UT,\n10 January. They also reproduced the main trends of ring\ncurrent development at large L shells near dusk. However,\nbetter agreement with Polar observations of locally mirror-\ning ion distributions was achieved at low L shells on the\nduskside at \u00010930 UT on 10 January when the modified\nAMIE model was used, reproducing the storm time rise of\nlow-energy protons due to increased convection.\n[25] 4) In this paper we compared for the first time\nprecipitating proton fluxes calculated with our model with\nPolar\/IPS data obtained during the storm we study. We\nfound that the observed precipitation at lower L shells in the\ndusk sector is in good agreement with model predictions\nwhen EMIC waves scattering was included in the model\nusing MACEP. There was no significant EMIC waves\nexcitation nor increase in ion precipitation when using\nVolland-Stern. This confirms the role of scattering by He+\nband EMIC waves as an important source of ion precipita-\ntion at these locations. These results are also in agreement\nFigure 10. Same as Figure 9 using Volland-Stern model.\nSMP 15 - 12 JORDANOVA ET AL.: RING CURRENT ASYMMETRY\nwith recent global IMAGE observations of intense pre-\ncipitation during storm time where the ring current and\nplasmasphere overlap. Some additional scattering mecha-\nnisms are needed to generate the intense ion precipitation\nat larger L > 5 shells during high geomagnetic activity\nseen by Polar\/IPS. These will be investigated in future\nextensions of this work.\n[26] In conclusion, this numerical simulation study\ndemonstrated the effect of the storm time convection\nelectric field on ring current particles energization, trap-\nping, and loss. An inner magnetospheric electric field\nmodel with increased spatial and temporal specification\nduring the main phase, MACEP, reproduced better the\nring current evolution during the January 1997 storm. In\nparticular, the ring current morphology, i.e., location of\nenergy peak, Dst* values, and magnitude of trapped and\nprecipitating fluxes showed better agreement with obser-\nvations when this higher-resolution model was used.\n[27] Acknowledgments.
