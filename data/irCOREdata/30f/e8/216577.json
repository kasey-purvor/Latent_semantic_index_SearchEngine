Hence it is an\nimportant question whether there is observational equivalence between deterministic and\nindeterministic descriptions. However, this question has hardly been discussed. This pa-\nper contributes to filling this gap by presenting and philosophically assessing three types of\nresults of increasing strength on the observational equivalence of deterministic and indeter-\nministic descriptions. When saying that a deterministic and an indeterministic description\nare observationally equivalent, I mean that the deterministic description, when observed,\ngives the same predictions as the indeterministic description. The deterministic and in-\ndeterministic descriptions of concern are continuous-time measure-theoretic deterministic\nsystems and stochastic processes.\nMore specifically, the first results are about observational equivalence to abstract math-\nematical descriptions. I present a method of constructing, given a deterministic system,\nan observationally equivalent stochastic process, and conversely. Compared to the first re-\nsults, the second results are stronger because they show not only observational equivalence\nto abstract mathematical descriptions but observational equivalence between deterministic\nand stochastic descriptions of the types antecedently found in science. Compared to the\nsecond results, the third results are even stronger because they show that there is obser-\nvational equivalence at every (not just at some) observation level between deterministic\nand stochastic descriptions found in science. Notice that the increase in strength is very\ndifferent for the move from the first to the second results (observational equivalence be-\ntween descriptions found in science and not just to abstract mathematical descriptions)\nand for the move from the second to the third results (observational equivalence between\ndescriptions in science at every, and not just at some, observation level).\nI argue that a philosophical consequence of these results is the following. Suppose one\nwants to find out whether a phenomenon is best modeled as deterministic or stochastic.\nThen one might think of arguing that there is evidence for a deterministic or stochastic\ndescription by appealing to a general difference between the probability distributions of\nstochastic processes found in science and the probability distributions of (possibly fine-\nenough) observations of deterministic systems found in science. The second and third\nresults of this paper show that these arguments are untenable because there is no such\ngeneral difference between the respective probability distributions.\nFinally, I criticise the previous philosophical discussion. The main philosophy literature\non this topic is Suppes and de Barros (1996), Suppes (1999) and Winnie (1998). They claim\nthat the significance of the third results is to provide a choice between deterministic and\nstochastic descriptions. I argue that while there is indeed such a choice, this is already\nshown by more basic results, and the third results show something stronger. Also, I criticise\nthe claims of the mathematicians Ornstein and Weiss (1991) on observational equivalence.\nAs mentioned above, this paper is about continuous-time measure-theoretic determin-\nistic systems and stochastic processes (here the time parameter varies continually). There\nare also discrete-time measure-theoretic deterministic systems and stochastic processes\n(here the time parameter varies in discrete steps). Werndl (2009a) discusses results about\ndiscrete-time descriptions which answer the question (for discrete time) of whether deter-\nministic and indeterministic descriptions can be observationally equivalent. One of the\n3\ncontributions of my paper is to answer this question for continuous-time deterministic sys-\ntems and stochastic processes. This is important because, first, the discrete-time results\nleave open the answers for continuous time, and the answers for continuous time do not\nfollow automatically from the discrete-time results. Indeed, as I will explain, the results\ndiffer for continuous-time and discrete-time descriptions; also, the proofs for continuous-\ntime descriptions are harder and involve different techniques. Second, continuous-time\ndescriptions are more widespread in science than discrete-time descriptions. Hence the\nissue of observational equivalence is more pressing for continuous-time descriptions.\nFurthermore, there are several novel contributions of this paper which are not discussed\nin Werndl (2009a) or the other extant literature. In particular, I show that there are results\non observational equivalence which increase in strength in a certain sense (namely, the focus\non descriptions found in science and on every observation level). For this I introduce two\nnew notions of observational equivalence at every observation level, I derive results for these\nnotions, and I discuss Kolmogorov\u2019s contribution to observational equivalence. Moreover,\nI assess the significance of these results and point at their philosophical consequences.\nAlso, the focus on continuous-time enables me to criticise the philosophical reflections of\nmathematicians, namely Ornstein and Weiss (1991). And I criticise in detail the claims of\nphilosophers such as Suppes and de Barros (1996), Suppes (1999) and Winnie (1998) on\nobservational equivalence.\nThis paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2 I introduce continuous-time measure-\ntheoretic deterministic descriptions and stochastic processes. In Section 3 I present and\nassess the first results, in Section 4 the second results, and in Section 5 the third results\non observational equivalence. Finally, in Section 6 I criticise the previous philosophical\ndiscussion on observational equivalence by philosophers and mathematicians.\n2 Continuous-Time Deterministic Systems and Stochas-\ntic Processes\nFor what follows, I need to introduce a few basic measure-theoretic notions. Intuitively\nspeaking, a probability space (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5) consists of a set M , a set \u03a3M of subsets of M to\nwhich a probability is assigned, called a sigma-algebra of M , and a probability measure \u00b5\nwhich assigns a probability to subsets of M . Formally, (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5) is a probability space if,\nand only if (iff), M is a set; \u03a3M is a sigma-algebra of M , i.e., a set of subsets of M with (i)\n\u2205 \u2208 \u03a3M , (ii) for all A \u2208 \u03a3M , M \\A \u2208 \u03a3M , and (iii) for any An \u2208 \u03a3M , n \u2265 1,\n\u22c3\nnAn \u2208 \u03a3M ;\nand \u00b5 is a probability measure, i.e., a function \u00b5 : \u03a3M \u2192 [0, 1] with (i) \u00b5(A) \u2265 0 for all A \u2208\n\u03a3M , (ii) \u00b5(\u2205) = 0 and \u00b5(M) = 1, and (iii)\n\u2211\nn\u22651 \u00b5(An) = \u00b5(\n\u22c3\nn\u22651An) for any An \u2208 \u03a3M .\nA pair (M,\u03a3M) where \u03a3M is a sigma-algebra of M is called a measurable space.

(1982), Doob (1953) and Petersen (1983).\n4\n2.1 Deterministic Systems\nThis paper is about continuous-time measure-theoretic deterministic systems, in short\ndeterministic systems, which are widespread in science. The three main elements of a\ndeterministic system are the phase space, i.e., a set M of all possible states, a probabil-\nity measure \u00b5 which assigns a probability to regions of phase space2, and the evolution\nfunctions, i.e., a family of functions Tt : M \u2192 M where Tt(m) represents the state of the\nsystem after t time units that started in initial state m. Formally:\nDefinition 1 A deterministic system is a quadruple (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, Tt) where (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5) is\na probability space (M is the phase space) and Tt : M \u2192 M (the evolution functions),\nt \u2208 R, are measurable functions such that Tt1+t2(m) = Tt2(Tt1(m)) for all m \u2208 M and all\nt1, t2 \u2208 R, and T (t,m) := Tt(m) is measurable in (t,m).\nA solution is a possible path of the deterministic system. Formally, the solution through\nm, m \u2208 M , is the function sm : R \u2192 M, sm(t) = T (t,m). All deterministic systems are\ndeterministic according to the canonical definition: any solutions that agree at one instant\nof time agree at all times (Butterfield 2005).\nI will often deal with measure-preserving deterministic systems where, intuitively speak-\ning, the probability of any region remains the same when the region is evolved.\nDefinition 2 A measure-preserving deterministic system is a deterministic system\n(M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, Tt) where \u00b5 is invariant, i.e., \u00b5(Tt(A)) = \u00b5(A) for all A \u2208 \u03a3M and t \u2208 R.\nMeasure-preserving deterministic systems are important in all the sciences, especially\nin physics (cf. Eckmann and Ruelle 1985). All deterministic Hamiltonian systems and\ndeterministic systems in statistical mechanics are measure-preserving, and their invariant\nprobability measure is the normalised Lebesgue measure or a similar measure (Cornfeld\net al. 1982, 4\u201310). A measure-preserving deterministic system is volume-preserving iff the\nnormalised Lebesgue measure \u2013 the standard measure of the volume \u2013 is the invariant\nprobability measure. A measure-preserving system which fails to be volume-preserving\nis dissipative. Dissipative systems can also often be modeled as measure-preserving sys-\ntems, e.g., the Lorenz system, which was introduced by Lorenz (1963) to model weather\nphenomena (cf. Luzatto et al. 2005).\nWhen observing a deterministic system (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, Tt), one observes a value \u03a6(m) de-\npendent on the actual state m. Thus, technically, observations are observation functions,\ni.e., measurable functions \u03a6 : M \u2192 MO where (MO,\u03a3MO) is a measurable space (cf. Orn-\nstein and Weiss 1991, 16). An observation function \u03a6 is finite-valued iff it takes only finitely\nmany values {o1, . . . , ok}, k \u2208 N, and every oi can be \u201cseen\u201d, i.e., \u00b5({m \u2208 M |\u03a6(m) =\noi}) > 0 for all i, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k. A finite-valued observation function is nontrivial iff k \u2265 2.\nIn practice observations are finite-valued.\nThe following deterministic system will accompany us.\nExample 1: A billiard system with convex obstacles.\nA billiard system with convex obstacles is a system where a ball moves with constant\n2The question of how to interpret this probability is not one of the main topics here. I just mention\na popular interpretation. According to the time-average interpretation, the probability of a set A is\nthe long-run fraction of the proportion of time the system spends in A (cf. Eckmann and Ruelle 1985;\nWerndl 2009b).\n5\nFigure 1: A billiard system with a convex obstacle; (a) a specific state of the billiard (b)\nthe mathematical representation of the billiard\nspeed on a rectangular table where there are a finite number of convex obstacles with\na smooth boundary. It is assumed that there is no friction and that there are perfectly\nelastic collisions (cf. Ornstein and Galavotti 1974). Figure 1(a) shows a specific state of\nthe billiard system, where the dashed line indicates the path the ball will take. Figure 1(b)\nshows the mathematical representation of the system. M is the set of all possible positions\nand directions of the ball. Hence the state of the billiard shown in Figure 1(a) corresponds\nto exactly one point m \u2208 M shown in Figure 1(b). The normalised Lebesgue measure \u00b5\nassigns the probability \u00b5(A) to the event that the billiard is in one of the states represented\nby A for any region A in \u03a3M (intuitively speaking, \u03a3M is the set of all regions; formally, \u03a3M\nis the Lebesgue \u03c3-algebra). Tt(m), where m = (q, p), gives the position and the direction\nafter t time units of the ball that starts out in initial position q and initial direction p. And\na solution is a possible path of the billiard over time.\n2.2 Stochastic Processes\nThe indeterministic descriptions of concern in this paper are continuous-time stochastic\nprocesses, in short stochastic processes. Stochastic processes are governed by probabilistic\nlaws. They are the main indeterministic descriptions used in science.\nA random variable Z gives the outcome of a probabilistic experiment, where the dis-\ntribution P{Z \u2208 A} tells one the probability that the outcome will be in A. Formally, a\nrandom variable is a measurable function Z : \u2126 \u2192 M\u00af from a probability space (\u2126,\u03a3\u2126, \u03bd)\nto a measurable space (M\u00af,\u03a3M\u00af). P{Z \u2208 A} = \u03bd(Z\u22121(A)) for all A \u2208 \u03a3M\u00af is the distribution\nof Z.\nA stochastic process {Zt; t \u2208 R} consists of a probabilistic experiment (i.e., a random\nvariable) for each time t. So Zt(\u03c9) gives the outcome of the process at time t (where \u03c9\nrepresents a possible history in all its details). Formally:\nDefinition 3 A stochastic process {Zt; t \u2208 R} is a family of random variables Zt, t \u2208 R,\nwhich are defined on the same probability space (\u2126,\u03a3\u2126, \u03bd) and take values in the same\n6\nFigure 2: A realisation of a semi-Markov process\nmeasurable space (M\u00af,\u03a3M\u00af) such that Z(t, \u03c9) = Zt(\u03c9) is jointly measurable in (t, \u03c9).\nM\u00af is the set of possible outcomes of the process, called the outcome space. A realisation is a\npossible path of the stochastic process. Formally, it is function r\u03c9 : R\u2192 M\u00af , r\u03c9(t) = Z(t, \u03c9),\nfor \u03c9 \u2208 \u2126 arbitrary (cf. Doob 1953, 4\u201346).\nI will often deal with stationary processes, the probability distributions of which do not\nchange with time. {Zt; t \u2208 R} is stationary iff the distribution of (Zt1+h, . . . , Ztn+h) is the\nsame as the one of (Zt1 , . . . , Ztn) for all t1, . . . , tn \u2208 R, n \u2208 N and h \u2208 R.\nWhen observing a stochastic process at time t, one observes a value \u0393(Zt) dependent\non the outcome Zt. Hence, technically, observations are modeled by observation functions,\ni.e., measurable functions \u0393 : M\u00af \u2192 M\u00afO, where (M\u00afO,\u03a3M\u00afO) is a measurable space. Clearly,\nobserving the stochastic process {Zt; t \u2208 R} with \u0393 yields the process {\u0393(Zt); t \u2208 R}.\nThe following stochastic processes will accompany us.\nExample 2: Semi-Markov processes.\nA semi-Markov process has finitely many possible outcomes si; it takes the outcome si for\na time u(si), and which outcome follows si depends only on si and no other past outcomes.\nFigure 2 shows a possible realisation of a semi-Markov process. For a formal definition,\nsee Subsection 8.1. Semi-Markov processes are widespread in the sciences, from physics\nand biology to the social sciences. They are particularly important in queueing theory\n(cf. Janssen and Limnios 1999).\nExample 3: n-step semi-Markov processes.\nn-step semi-Markov processes generalise semi-Markov processes. An n-step semi-Markov\nprocess, n \u2208 N, has finitely many possible outcomes si; it takes the outcome si for a time\nu(si), and which outcome follows si depends only on the past n outcomes (hence semi-\nMarkov processes are 1-step semi-Markov processes). For a formal definition, see Subsec-\ntion 8.1. Again, n-step semi-Markov processes are widespread in science (cf. Janssen and\nLimnios 1999).\nA final comment: the descriptions introduced in this section are classical. What results\nhold for quantum-mechanical descriptions and how similarities and differences in the results\nbear on the relation between classical and quantum mechanics are interesting questions;\nbut they are beyond the scope of this paper.\n7\nFigure 3: The billiard observed with \u03a6 is observationally equivalent to {\u03a6(Tt); t \u2208 R}.\n3 Observational Equivalence: Results I\nThis section is about observational equivalence to mathematical descriptions. I show how,\nwhen starting with deterministic systems, one finds observationally equivalent stochastic\nprocesses (Subsection 3.1), and how, when starting with stochastic processes, one finds\nobservationally equivalent deterministic systems (Subsection 3.2).\nI speak of observational equivalence if the deterministic system, when observed, and the\nstochastic process give the same predictions. More specifically, deterministic systems are\nendowed with a probability measure. Hence when observing a deterministic system, the\nresulting predictions are the probability distributions over sequences of possible observa-\ntions. The predictions obtained from a stochastic process are the probability distributions\nover the realisations. Consequently, a deterministic system, when observed, and a stochas-\ntic process give the same predictions iff (i) the possible outcomes of the process and the\npossible observed values of the system coincide, and (ii) the realisations of the process\nand the solutions of the system coarse-grained by the observation function have the same\nprobability distribution.\n3.1 Starting With Deterministic Systems\nAssume (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, Tt) is observed with \u03a6 : M \u2192MO. Then {\u03a6(Tt); t \u2208 R} is a stochastic\nprocess, which arises by applying \u03a6 to the deterministic system. Thus the possible out-\ncomes of the process and the possible observed values of the deterministic system coincide,\nand the probability distributions over the realisations of the process and over the solu-\ntions of the system coarse-grained by the observation function are the same. Therefore,\n(M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, Tt) observed with \u03a6 is observationally equivalent to {\u03a6(Tt); t \u2208 R}.\nLet me illustrate this with the billiard system with convex obstacles. Figure 3 shows the\nphase space M of the billiard system (cf. Figure 1(b)) and an observation function \u03a6 with\nvalues o1, o2, o3, o4: for all states m in the top left box the observed value is o1, etc. Because\na probability measure \u00b5 is defined on M , one obtains probabilities such as P{\u03a6(Tt) = o2}\nand P{\u03a6(Tt+k) = o4 given that \u03a6(Tt) = o3}. {\u03a6(Tt); t \u2208 R} has the outcomes o1, o2, o3, o4\n8\nand its probability distributions are obtained by observing the billiard system with \u03a6.\nThus the billiard system observed with \u03a6 is observationally equivalent to {\u03a6(Tt); t \u2208 R}.\nHowever, we want to know whether {\u03a6(Tt); t \u2208 R} is nontrivial. For let \u03a6(m) = m\nbe the identity function. {\u03a6(Tt(m)); t \u2208 R} = {Tt(m); t \u2208 R} is formally a stochastic\nprocess which is observationally equivalent to the deterministic system. Yet it is just\nthe original deterministic system. This result is the formalisation of the old idea that a\ndeterministic system is the special case of a stochastic process where all probabilities are 0\nor 1 (cf. Butterfield 2005). It illustrates that if one wants to arrive at nontrivial stochastic\nprocesses, one has to apply observation functions which are many-to-one.\nYet {\u03a6(Tt); t \u2208 R} is often nontrivial. Several results show this. To my knowledge, the\nfollowing theorem has never been discussed before. This theorem characterises a class of\ndeterministic systems as systems where, regardless which finite-valued observation function\n\u03a6 is applied, {\u03a6(Tt); t \u2208 R} is nontrivial in the following sense: for any k \u2208 R+ there are\noutcomes oi, oj \u2208 MO such that the probability of moving in k time steps from oi to oj is\nbetween 0 and 1. This result is strong because there are nontrivial probability distributions\nfor any finite-valued observation function and all time steps.\nTheorem 1 Iff for a measure-preserving deterministic system (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, Tt) there does\nnot exist a n \u2208 R+ and a C \u2208 \u03a3M , 0 < \u00b5(C) < 1, such that, except for a set of measure\nzero3, Tn(C) = C, then the following holds: for every nontrivial finite-valued observation\nfunction \u03a6 : M \u2192 MO, every k \u2208 R+ and {Zt; t \u2208 R} := {\u03a6(Tt); t \u2208 R} there are\noi, oj \u2208MO with 0 < P{Zt+k=oj |Zt=oi} < 1.\nFor a proof, see Subsection 8.2.4\nThe assumption of Theorem 1 is equivalent to weak mixing (Hopf 1932). This indicates\na difference between the results for discrete and continuous time. As shown in Werndl\n(2009a), for discrete time the condition needed to arrive at the results that, regardless\nwhich finite-valued observation function and time step is considered, one always obtains\nnontrivial probability distributions is weaker than weak mixing. In particular, Werndl\n(2009a, Section 4.2.2) shows that this result holds even for a class of stable deterministic\nsystems (i.e., where solutions which start closely stay close all the time). This is not\nthe case for continuous time because if a deterministic system is weak mixing, there is a\nsense in which solutions which start closely eventually separate (cf. Werndl 2009a). Yet\nTheorem 1 is just one of the possible theorems one can prove. Dependent on one\u2019s purpose,\none can weaken (or strengthen) the conditions to prove weaker (or stronger5) results on\nobservational equivalence. And weaker results than Theorem 1 show that one obtains\nobservational equivalence to nontrivial stochastic processes also for stable deterministic\nsystems and thus also for non-chaotic systems (chaotic systems show deterministic yet\nunstable behaviour). For instance, consider the deterministic system of a rotation on a\ncircle, which is stable and non-chaotic; M = [0, 1) represents the circle of unit radius, \u03a3M\nis the Lebesgue \u03c3-algebra, \u00b5 the Lebesgue measure and Tt(m) = \u03b1tm (mod 1), \u03b1 \u2208 R. It\n3That is, except for Q with \u00b5(Q) = 0.\n4If (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, Tt) is measure-preserving, {\u03a6(Tt); t \u2208 R} is stationary (the proof in Werndl 2009a, Sec-\ntion 3.3, carries over to continuous time).\n5For instance, a stronger result is that for Kolmogorov systems and any finite-valued observation func-\ntion the following holds: even if you know the entire infinite history of the process, you will not be able to\npredict with certainty which outcome follows next (Uffink 2006, 1012\u20131014).\n9\nis not hard to see that for any finite-valued observation function \u03a6 the stochastic process\n{Zt; t \u2208 R} = {\u03a6(Tt); t \u2208 R} is nontrivial in the sense that for almost all (but not\nall) time steps there are nontrivial probability distributions. Technically: for any finite-\nvalued \u03a6 and all, except for a set of measure zero, k \u2208 R+, there are oi, oj \u2208 MO with\n0 < P{Zt+k=oj |Zt=oi} < 1, where {Zt} = {\u03a6(Tt); t \u2208 R}.\nMeasure-preserving systems are typically weakly mixing (Halmos 1944, 1949). Con-\nsequently, Theorem 1 typically applies to measure-preserving deterministic systems. Yet\nthis does not tell us whether Theorem 1 applies to the deterministic systems of physical\nrelevance; systems of physical relevance are only a small class of all measure-preserving\nsystems. But Theorem 1 applies to several physically relevant deterministic systems. It\napplies to systems in Newtonian mechanics: for instance, first, to billiard systems with\nconvex obstacles (Example 1) (Ornstein and Galavotti 1974); second, to many hard-ball\nsystems, which describe the motion of a number of hard balls undergoing elastic reflec-\ntions at the boundary and collisions amongst each other and are important in statistical\nmechanics because they model gases; e.g., to two hard balls in a box and the motion of N\nhard balls on a torus for almost all values (m1, . . . ,mN , r), where mi is the mass of the i-th\nball and r is the radius of the balls, N \u2265 2 (Berkovitz et al. 2006, 679\u2013680; Sima\u00b4nyi 2003);\nthird, to geodesic flows of negative curvature, i.e., frictionless motion of a particle moving\nwith unit speed on a compact manifold with everywhere negative curvature (Ornstein and\nWeiss 1991, Section 4). Also, Theorem 1 applies to dissipative systems, such as Lorenz-\ntype systems, which model weather dynamics and waterwheels (Lorenz 1963; Luzzatto\net al. 2005; Strogatz 1994). Because proofs are extremely hard, it is often only conjec-\ntured that deterministic systems satisfy Theorem 1, e.g., for any number of hard balls in\na box (Berkovitz et al. 2006, 679\u2013680). Note that the deterministic systems listed in this\nparagraph are chaotic.\nThere are also many systems to which Theorem 1 does not apply. For instance, ac-\ncording to the KAM theorem, the phase space of integrable Hamiltonian systems which\nare perturbed by a small non-integrable perturbation breaks up into stable regions and\nregions with unstable behavior. Because of the break up into regions, Theorem 1 does not\napply to these systems (cf. Berkovitz et al. 2006, Section 4). But even if Theorem 1 does\nnot apply to the whole deterministic system, it might well apply to the motion restricted\nto some regions A of phase space (and this is conjectured for KAM-type systems). Then\nit follows from Theorem 1 that all finite-valued observations which discriminate between\nvalues in A lead to nontrivial stochastic processes.\n3.2 Starting With Stochastic Processes\nThe following idea of how, given stochastic processes, one finds observationally equivalent\ndeterministic systems will be needed for what follows. It is well known in mathematics and\nin philosophy of physics (Butterfield 2005; Doob 1953, 6\u20137; for discrete time it is discussed\nin Werndl 2009a, Section 3.2).\nThe underlying idea is that one constructs a deterministic system whose phase space is\nthe set of all possible realisations m(\u03c4), whose evolution functions Tt shift the realisation t\ntime steps to the left, and whose observation function \u03a60 gives the value of the realisation\nat time 0. Because Tt shifts the realisation m(\u03c4) t time steps to the left, observing Tt(m(\u03c4))\nwith \u03a60 gives the value of the realisation m(\u03c4) at time t. Hence successive observations\n10\nreturn the values of the realisation m(\u03c4) at different times and so simply yield the outcomes\nof the stochastic process.\nFormally, for {Zt; t \u2208 R} with outcome space M\u00af , let M be the set of all possible\nrealisations, i.e., functions m(\u03c4) from R to M\u00af . Let \u03a3M be the \u03c3-algebra generated6 by the\ncylinder-sets\nCA1...Ani1...in ={m\u2208M |m(i1)\u2208A1, ...,m(in)\u2208An, Aj\u2208\u03a3M\u00af , ij\u2208R, i1< ... <in, 1\u2264 j\u2264 n}. (1)\nLet \u00b5 be the measure on M determined by the probability distributions of {Zt; t \u2208 R}.\nThat is, \u00b5 is the unique probability measure arising by assigning to each CA1...Ani1...in the\nprobability P{Zi1 \u2208 A1, . . . , Zin \u2208 An}. The evolution functions shift a realisation t\ntimes to the left, i.e., Tt(m(\u03c4)) = m(\u03c4 + t). (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, Tt) is a deterministic system\ncalled the deterministic representation of {Zt; t \u2208 R} (cf. Doob 1953, 621\u2013622). Finally,\nassume that the observation function gives the value of the realisation at time zero, i.e.,\n\u03a60(m(\u03c4)) = m(0).\nBecause one only observes the 0-th coordinate, the possible outcomes of a stochastic\nprocess and the possible observed values of its deterministic representation coincide. More-\nover, because \u00b5 is defined by the stochastic process, the probability distribution over the\nrealisations is the same as the one over the sequences of observed values of its deterministic\nrepresentation. Therefore, a stochastic process is observationally equivalent to its determin-\nistic representation observed with \u03a60. Consequently, for every process there is at least one\nobservationally equivalent deterministic system.7 For instance, consider a semi-Markov\nprocess {Zt; t \u2208 R} (Example 2) and its deterministic representation (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, Tt). Here\nM is the set of all possible realisations of the semi-Markov process, \u00b5 gives the probability\ndistribution over the realisations, Tt shifts a realisation t time steps to the left, and \u03a60\nreturns the value of the realisation at time 0.\nPhilosophically speaking, the deterministic representation is a cheat. For it resembles\nthe following argument: Fred was fatally wounded at noon; therefore he died later. The\npredicate \u2018being fatally wounded a noon\u2019 implies that Fred will die later. Hence the ar-\ngument is trivially valid. Similarly, the states of the deterministic representation are con-\nstructed such that they encode the future and past evolution of the process. So there is\nthe question whether deterministic systems which do not involve a cheat can be observa-\ntionally equivalent to a given stochastic process. It will become clear later that for some\nstochastic processes the answer is positive. It is unknown whether the answer is positive\nfor every stochastic process. For a formalisation of the notion of observational equivalence\nunderlying Section 3, see Werndl 2009a (the definition carries over to continuous-time).\n4 Observational Equivalence: Results II\nThe previous section only showed that in certain cases there is observational equivalence to\nabstract mathematical descriptions. Furthermore, the deterministic representation \u2013 one of\nthese abstract mathematical descriptions \u2013 is not used by scientists. This raises the ques-\ntion of whether there can be observational equivalence not only to abstract mathematical\n6The \u03c3-algebra generated by E is the smallest \u03c3-algebra containing E; that is, the \u03c3-algebra\u22c2\n\u03c3-algebras \u03a3, E\u2286\u03a3 \u03a3.\n7The deterministic representation of any stationary process is measure-preserving (the proof in\nWerndl 2009a, Section 3.3, carries over to continuous time).\n11\ndescriptions but whether a stronger result can hold: namely, that there is observational\nequivalence between stochastic processes and deterministic systems of the types used in\nscientific theorising (in short, systems and processes in science).\nIf the answer is negative, one could divide the probability distributions found in science\ninto two groups: the ones deriving from observations of deterministic systems in science,\nand the ones deriving from stochastic processes in science and their observations.8 Sup-\npose one wants to find out whether a phenomenon is best described as deterministic or\nstochastic. Then one might argue the following: if the observed probability distributions\nare of the type of deterministic systems in science, the evidence speaks for a determinis-\ntic description. Conversely, if the probability distributions are of the type of stochastic\nprocesses in science, this provides evidence for a stochastic description. The idea here is\nthat the probability distributions characteristically found for deterministic (or stochastic)\ndescriptions in science provide inductive evidence for a deterministic (or stochastic) de-\nscription. There is the question whether such an argument is convincing. Clearly, it can\nonly work if there is indeed a division between the respective probability distributions. So\nlet us ask: is there a deterministic system in science and is there an observation function\nsuch that the deterministic system, when observed, yields a stochastic process in science?\n4.1 Kolmogorov\u2019s Conjecture\nKolmogorov found it hard to imagine a positive answer to this question. More specifi-\ncally, it has been nearly forgotten (and has neither been subject to a systematic historical\ninvestigation nor been discussed philosophically) that Kolmogorov conjectured the follow-\ning. Suppose an observed deterministic system yields a stochastic process in science; then\nthe observed deterministic system produces positive information. Contrary to this, any\narbitrary observation of a deterministic system in science never produces positive informa-\ntion. Employing ideas in information theory, the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy (KS-entropy)\nwas introduced to capture the highest amount of information, or equivalently the high-\nest amount of uncertainty, that an observation of a deterministic system could produce;\nwhere a positive KS-entropy indicates that there are observations which produce positive\ninformation. Kolmogorov expected that the KS-entropy would accomplish the separation\nof deterministic systems in science from the deterministic systems producing stochastic\nprocesses in science: the former have zero entropy, the latter have positive entropy.\nSo it was a big surprise when, from the 1960s onwards, it was found that also many de-\nterministic systems in science have positive KS-entropy and thus have observations which\nproduce positive information. Namely, all the deterministic systems listed in Subsection 3.1\nas systems of physical relevance to which Theorem 1 applies have positive KS-entropy; in\nparticular, billiard systems with convex obstacles (Example 1), many hard-ball systems,\ngeodesic flows of constant negative curvature and Lorenz-type systems. For many systems\nin science, such as for KAM-type systems, it is conjectured that they have positive KS-\nentropy. Hence Kolmogorov\u2019s attempt to separate deterministic systems in science from de-\nterministic systems which produce stochastic processes in science failed (Radunskaya 1992,\n8By \u2018probability distributions\u2019 I mean here nontrivial probability distributions (not all probabilities 0\nor 1). Otherwise such a division could never exist. For consider a process composed of two semi-Markov\nprocesses (Example 2), and an observation function which tells one whether the outcome is among those\nof the first or the second process. Then the observed probability distribution is trivial.\n12\nchapter 1; Sinai 1989, 835\u2013837).\n4.2 Deterministic Systems in Science Which Are Observation-\nally Equivalent to Stochastic Processes in Science\nSo is there a deterministic system in science and an observation such that the observed\ndeterministic system yields a stochastic process in science? To answer this, I need to\nintroduce the definitions of a continuous Bernoulli system and of isomorphism.\nIntuitively speaking, Bernoulli systems are strongly chaotic.\nDefinition 4 The measure-preserving deterministic system (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, Tt) is a continuous\nBernoulli system iff for all t \u2208 R\\{0} the discrete measure-preserving deterministic system\n(M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, Tt) is a discrete Bernoulli system.\nFor the discussion in the main text, the details of this definition are not important.9 Here it\njust matters that several deterministic systems in science are continuous Bernoulli system;\nnamely, all the systems listed in the previous subsection as systems with positive KS-\nentropy, in particular, billiard systems with convex obstacles (Example 1), many hard-ball\nsystems, geodesic flows of constant negative curvature and Lorenz-type systems. Again,\nfor several systems, e.g., for the motion on unstable regions of KAM-type systems, it is\nconjectured that they are continuous Bernoulli systems.\nIsomorphic deterministic systems are probabilistically equivalent, i.e., their states can\nbe put into one-to-one correspondence (via a function \u03c6) such that the corresponding\nsolutions have the same probability distributions.\nDefinition 5 The measure-preserving deterministic systems (M1,\u03a3M1 , \u00b51, T\n1\nt ) and\n(M2,\u03a3M2 , \u00b52, T\n2\nt ) are isomorphic iff there are M\u02c6i \u2286Mi with \u00b5i(Mi\\M\u02c6i) = 0 and T it M\u02c6i \u2286 M\u02c6i\nfor all t (i = 1, 2), and there is a bijection \u03c6 : M\u02c61\u2192 M\u02c62 such that (i) \u03c6(A)\u2208\u03a3M2 for all\nA\u2208\u03a3M1 , A \u2286 M\u02c61, and \u03c6\u22121(B) \u2208 \u03a3M1 for all B \u2208 \u03a3M2 , B \u2286 M\u02c62; (ii) \u00b52(\u03c6(A)) = \u00b51(A) for\nall A \u2208 \u03a3M1 , A \u2286 M\u02c61; (iii) \u03c6(T 1t (m)) = T 2t (\u03c6(m)) for all m \u2208 M\u02c61, t \u2208 R.\nNow assume that (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, Tt) is isomorphic (via \u03c6 : M\u02c6 \u2192 M\u02c62) to the deterministic\nrepresentation (M2,\u03a3M2 , \u00b52, T\n2\nt ) of the stochastic process {Zt; t \u2208 R}. This means that\nthere is a one-to-one correspondence between the states of the system and the realisations\nof the process. Recall that observing (M2,\u03a3M2 , \u00b52, T\n2\nt ) with \u03a60 yields {Zt; t \u2208 R} (where\n\u03a60(m2(\u03c4)) = m2(0)). Consequently, (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, Tt) observed with the observation function\n\u03a6 := \u03a60(\u03c6(m)) is observationally equivalent to {Zt; t \u2208 R}10\n9A discrete Bernoulli system is defined as follows. Recall Definition 12 of a discrete measure-preserving\ndeterministic system. A doubly-infinite sequence of independent rolls of an N -sided die where the prob-\nability of obtaining sk is pk, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 N ,\n\u2211N\nk=1 pk = 1, is a Bernoulli process. Let M be the set of all\nbi-infinite sequences m = (. . .m(\u22121),m(0),m(1) . . .) with m(i) \u2208 M\u00af = {s1, . . . , sN}. Let \u03a3M be the\n\u03c3-algebra generated by the cylinder-sets C\n{sl1}...{sln}\ni1...in\nas defined in (1) with ij \u2208 Z, slj \u2208 M\u00af . These sets\nhave probability \u00b5\u00af(C\n{sl1}...{sln}\ni1...in\n) = psl1 ...psln . Let \u00b5 the unique measure determined by \u00b5\u00af on \u03a3M . Let\nT : M \u2192M, T ((. . .m(i) . . .)) = (. . .m(i+ 1) . . .). (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, T ) is called a Bernoulli shift. Finally, a dis-\ncrete measure-preserving deterministic system is a Bernoulli system iff it is isomorphic to some Bernoulli\nshift (isomorphism is exactly defined as for continuous time \u2013 see Definition 5).\n10It does not matter how \u03a60(\u03c6(m)) is defined for m \u2208M \\ M\u02c6 .\n13\nAn important application of this principle is as follows. A deep result shows that\nup to a scaling of time t any continuous Bernoulli systems are isomorphic. That is,\ngiven continuous Bernoulli systems (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, Tt) and (M2,\u03a3M2 , \u00b52, T\n2\nt ) there is a c > 0\nsuch that (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, Tt) and (M2,\u03a3M2 , \u00b52, T\n2\nct) are isomorphic (Ornstein 1974). Now re-\ncall semi-Markov processes (Example 2). Ornstein (1970) proved that the determinis-\ntic representation (M2,\u03a3M2 , \u00b52, T\n2\nt ) of any semi-Markov process is a continuous Bernoulli\nsystem. Clearly, for any c \u2208 R+, (M2,\u03a3M2 , \u00b52, T 2ct) is still the deterministic represen-\ntation of a semi-Markov process. Therefore, given any continuous Bernoulli system in\nscience (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, Tt), there is a semi-Markov process whose deterministic representation\n(M2,\u03a3M2 , \u00b52, T\n2\nct) is isomorphic (via \u03c6) to (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, Tt), implying that (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, Tt) ob-\nserved with \u03a6 := \u03a60(\u03c6(m)) produces the semi-Markov process. For instance, billiards with\nconvex obstacles (Example 1) are continuous Bernoulli systems. Hence there is an obser-\nvation function \u03a6 which, applied to the billiard system, yields a semi-Markov processes.\nThe converse is also true: given any semi-Markov process, there is a Bernoulli system\nin science which is observationally equivalent to the semi-Markov process. For given any\nBernoulli system in science (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, Tt), (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, Tct) is also a system in science (e.g.,\nfor billiard systems this means that the constant speed of the ball is changed from s\nto cs). Thus given any semi-Markov process there is a deterministic system in science\n(M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, Tct) which is isomorphic to the deterministic representation (M2,\u03a3M2 , \u00b52, T\n2\nt )\nof the semi-Markov process, implying that (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, Tct) observed with \u03a6 := \u03a60(\u03c6(m))\nyields the semi-Markov process. For instance, given any semi-Markov process (Example 2),\none can change the constant speed of a billiard system with convex obstacles such that an\nobservation of the billiard system yields the semi-Markov process.\nTo sum up, deterministic systems in science (namely, certain Bernoulli systems) are ob-\nservationally equivalent to semi-Markov processes (which are widespread in science).11 For\ndiscrete time Werndl (2009a, Section 4) showed that some deterministic systems in science\nare observationally equivalent to Bernoulli processes or discrete-time Markov processes\n(both are widespread in science). Yet this left open whether continuous-time deterministic\nsystems in science can yield stochastic processes in science. Indeed, Werndl\u2019s results on\nBernoulli or Markov processes do not carry over to continuous time: Bernoulli processes are\nonly defined for discrete time and there are no deterministic systems in science which yield\ncontinuous-time Markov processes. The latter holds because a deterministic system can\nonly be observationally equivalent to a continuous-time Markov process if the KS-entropy\nof the Markov process is not higher than the KS-entropy of the system; but determinis-\ntic systems in science have finite KS-entropy, and continuous-time Markov processes have\ninfinite KS-entropy (Feldman and Smorodinsky 1971; Ornstein and Weiss 1991, 19).\nSo I conclude that the answer to the question advanced at the beginning of this section\nis positive: there are deterministic systems in science and observation functions such that\nthe deterministic systems, when observed, yield stochastic processes in science.12 So there is\nobservational equivalence not just to abstract mathematical descriptions (as shown in Sec-\ntion 3)13 but a stronger form of observational equivalence between descriptions in science.\n11n-step semi-Markov processes are continuous Bernoulli systems too (Ornstein 1974). Therefore, an\nanalogous argument shows that Bernoulli systems in science are observationally equivalent to n-step semi-\nMarkov processes.\n12My arguments allow any meaning of \u2018deterministic systems deriving from scientific theories\u2019 that\nexcludes the deterministic representation but is wide enough to include some continuous Bernoulli systems.\n13Also, compared to the results in Section 3, the results here concern a narrower class of descriptions,\n14\nThus any argument that a phenomenon is best described as deterministic or stochastic\n(such as the one sketched at the beginning of this section) cannot work when it relies on\nthe premise that there is a division between the probability distributions of deterministic\nand stochastic descriptions in science.\n5 Observational Equivalence: Results III\nIn the previous section we have seen that there are some observations of deterministic\nsystems in science which yield stochastic processes in science. Now let us ask whether an\neven stronger result holds. Namely, can deterministic systems in science and stochastic\nprocesses in science be observationally equivalent at every observation level (and not just\nfor some observation)? Note that, compared to the previous section, the type of systems\nconsidered remain the same, namely deterministic and stochastic descriptions in science.\nIntuitively, one might think that deterministic systems in science can yield stochastic\nprocesses in science only if specific coarse observation functions are applied. If this is true,\nfine-enough observations of deterministic systems in science would yield different proba-\nbility distributions than stochastic processes in science. Then, if one wants to find out\nwhether a phenomenon is best described as deterministic or stochastic, one might argue\nthe following: if fine observations yield probability distributions characteristically found\nfor deterministic systems in science, the evidence favours a deterministic description. The\nidea here is that the existence of characteristic probability distributions for deterministic\nsystems found in science gives us inductive evidence that a phenomenon is best described\nas deterministic. Such an argument is only tenable if fine-enough observations of deter-\nministic systems indeed yield special probability distributions, i.e., if the question whether\ndeterministic systems in science can be observationally equivalent at every observation level\nto stochastic processes in science has a negative answer. So let us focus on this question.\n5.1 The Meaning of Observational Equivalence at Every Ob-\nservation Level\nWhat does it mean that \u2018stochastic processes of a certain type are observationally equivalent\nto a deterministic system at every observation level \u2019? I will first introduce the standard\nnotion and then two new notions. I focus on measure-preserving deterministic systems\nand, correspondingly, stationary stochastic processes because all examples will be of this\nkind.\nThe usual meaning based on \u03b5-congruence\nTo introduce the standard notion, I start by explaining what it means for a deterministic\nsystem and a stochastic process to give the same predictions at an observation level \u03b5 >\n0, \u03b5 \u2208 R. For sufficiently small \u03b51 > 0 one cannot distinguish states of the deterministic\nsystem which are less than the distance \u03b51 apart. Also, for sufficiently small \u03b52 > 0 one\nwill not be able to distinguish differences in probabilities of less than \u03b52. Assume that\n\u03b5 < min{\u03b51, \u03b52}. Then a deterministic system and a stochastic process give the same\nnamely only continuous Bernoulli systems, semi-Markov processes and n-step semi-Markov processes.\n15\npredictions at level \u03b5 iff the following shadowing result holds: the solutions can be put\ninto one-to-one correspondence with the realisations such that the state of the system and\nthe outcome of the process are at all time points within distance \u03b5 except for a set of\nprobability smaller than \u03b5.\n\u03b5-congruence captures this idea mathematically (one assumes that a metric dM measures\ndistances between states and that the possible outcomes of the process are in M ; also,\nrecall the deterministic representation as discussed in Subsection 3.2 and Definition 5 of\nisomorphism):\nDefinition 6 Let (M,\u03a3M ,\u00b5,Tt) be a measure-preserving deterministic system, where (M,dM)\nis a metric space. Let (M2,\u03a3M2 , \u00b52, T\n2\nt ) be the deterministic representation of the stochas-\ntic process {Zt; t \u2208 R} and let \u03a60 : M2 \u2192 M, \u03a60(m2(\u03c4)) = m2(0). (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, Tt)\nis \u03b5-congruent to {Zt; t \u2208 R} iff (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, Tt) is isomorphic via \u03c6 : M \u2192 M2 to\n(M2,\u03a3M2 , \u00b52, T\n2\nt ) and dM(m,\u03a60(\u03c6(m)))<\u03b5 for all m\u2208M except for a set of measure<\u03b5.\nNow we generalise over \u03b5 and arrive at a plausible meaning of the phrase that \u2018stochastic\nprocesses of a certain type are observationally equivalent at every observation level to a\ndeterministic system\u2019. Namely: for every \u03b5 > 0 there is a process of this type which is\n\u03b5-congruent to the system (cf. Ornstein and Weiss 1991, 22\u201323; Suppes 1999).\nThe idea for new notions of observational equivalence at every observation level starts\nfrom the following thought. \u03b5-congruence does not assume that the system is observed with\nan observation function: the actual states of the deterministic system, not the observed\nones, are compared with the outcomes of the stochastic process. To arrive at a notion of\nobservational equivalence, no observation functions are invoked, but it is asked whether\nthe state of the system and the outcome of the process are less than \u03b5 apart. (I should\nmention that if (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, Tt) and {Zt; t \u2208 R} are \u03b5-congruent, then {\u03a8(Tt); t \u2208 R},\nwhere \u03a8(m) := \u03a60(\u03c6(m)), is the process {Zt; t \u2208 R}. Technically, \u03a8 is an observation\nfunction but for \u03b5-congruence it is not interpreted in this way. Instead, the meaning of \u03a8 is\nas follows: when it is applied to the system, the resulting process shadows the deterministic\nsystem.)\nIn many contexts, such as in Newtonian and statistical mechanics, observations are\nmodeled by observation functions, and one would like to know what happens when specific\nobservation functions are applied. Thus it would be desirable to have a notion of obser-\nvational equivalence at every observation level based on observation functions. Results\nabout other notions might be regarded as wanting because they leave unclear what hap-\npens when observation functions are applied. As explained, \u03b5-congruence is not based on\nobservation functions. For this reason, I now introduce two other notions of observational\nequivalence at every observation level. Whether a notion is preferable that (i) tells one\nwhat happens when one cannot distinguish between states which are less than \u03b5 apart\n(such as the notion based on \u03b5-congruence) or (ii) tells one what stochastic processes are\nobtained if specific observation functions are applied (such as the notions introduced in\nthe next two paragraphs) will depend on the modeling process and the phenomenon under\nconsideration.\nA new meaning based on strong (\u03a6, \u03b5)-simulation\nFirst, I have to explain what it means for a stochastic process and a deterministic system\nas observed with an observation function \u03a6 to give the same predictions relative to accu-\n16\nracy \u03b5 > 0, \u03b5 \u2208 R+ (\u03b5 indicates that one cannot distinguish differences in probabilistic\npredictions of less than \u03b5). Plausibly, this means that the possible observed values of the\nsystem and the possible outcomes of the process coincide, and that the probabilistic pre-\ndictions of the observed deterministic system and of the stochastic process differ by less\nthan \u03b5. Strong (\u03a6, \u03b5)-simulation captures this idea mathematically. I assume that \u03a6 is\nfinite-valued, as it is in practice.\nDefinition 7 {Zt; t \u2208 R} strongly (\u03a6, \u03b5)-simulates a measure-preserving deterministic\nsystem (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, Tt), where \u03a6 : M \u2192 M\u00af is a surjective finite-valued observation function,\niff there is a surjective measurable function \u03a8 : M \u2192 M\u00af such that (i) Zt = \u03a8(Tt) for all\nt \u2208 R and (ii) \u00b5({m \u2208M |\u03a8(m) 6= \u03a6(m)}) < \u03b5.\nBy generalising over \u03a6 and \u03b5 one obtains a plausible meaning of the notion that pro-\ncesses of a certain type are observationally equivalent at every observation level to a system.\nNamely: for every finite-valued \u03a6 and every \u03b5 there is a stochastic process of this type which\nstrongly (\u03a6, \u03b5)-simulates the deterministic system. This notion is attractive because it tells\nus what probability distributions are obtained when any finite-valued observation function\nis applied. Yet, to my knowledge, it has not been discussed before.\nA new meaning based on weak (\u03a6, \u03b5)-simulation\nIf one asks whether the probability distributions obtained by applying \u03a6 to the determin-\nistic system could derive from a stochastic process of a certain kind, the notion of strong\n(\u03a6, \u03b5)-simulation is stronger than what is needed. Is suffices that the observed probability\ndistributions could result from an observation of a stochastic process of a certain kind (this\nwill be of some relevance later \u2013 see the end of Subsection 5.2). More specifically, if suffices\nto require the following. Given a deterministic system observed with \u03a6, there is an observa-\ntion \u0393 of a stochastic process such that the following holds: the possible observed outcomes\nof the process are the possible observed values of the deterministic system, and the proba-\nbilistic predictions of the process observed with \u0393 and the probabilistic predictions of the\nsystem observed with \u03a6 differ by less than \u03b5. Technically, weak (\u03a6, \u03b5)-simulation captures\nthis idea.\nDefinition 8 {Zt; t \u2208 R} weakly (\u03a6, \u03b5)-simulates a measure-preserving deterministic sys-\ntem (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, Tt), where \u03a6 : M \u2192 M\u00af is a surjective finite-valued observation func-\ntion, iff there is a surjective measurable function \u03a8 : M \u2192 S and a surjective ob-\nservation function \u0393 : S \u2192 M\u00af such that (i) \u0393(Zt) = \u03a8(Tt) for all t \u2208 R and (ii)\n\u00b5({m \u2208M |\u03a8(m) 6= \u03a6(m)}) < \u03b5.\nClearly, if a stochastic process strongly (\u03a6, \u03b5)-simulates a system, it also weakly (\u03a6, \u03b5)-\nsimulates it (choose \u0393(s) = s). The converse is generally not true. By generalising over \u03a6\nand \u03b5, one obtains a plausible meaning of the notion that stochastic processes of a certain\ntype are observationally equivalent at every observation level to a deterministic system.\nNamely: for every finite-valued \u03a6 and every \u03b5 there is a process of this type which weakly\n(\u03a6, \u03b5)-simulates the system. To my knowledge, this notion has never been discussed.\nAccording to all three notions, at every observation level, the data could derive from\nthe deterministic system or a stochastic process of a certain type. So let us see what results\nobtain for the three notions.\n17\n5.2 Stochastic Processes in Science Which Are Observation-\nally Equivalent at Every Observation Level to Determinis-\ntic Systems in Science\nThe next three theorems show that the following holds for our three notions: continuous\nBernoulli systems (Definition 4), including several systems in science, are observationally\nequivalent at every observation level to semi-Markov processes (notion one and three) or\nn-step semi-Markov processes (notion two), which are widespread in science.\nTheorem 2 Let (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, Tt) be a continuous Bernoulli system where the metric space\n(M,dM) is separable\n14 and \u03a3M contains all open sets of (M,dM). Then for every \u03b5 > 0,\n(M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, Tt) is \u03b5-congruent to a semi-Markov process.\nFor a proof see Ornstein and Weiss (1991, 93\u201394). The assumptions of this theorem are ful-\nfilled by all continuous Bernoulli systems in science. For discrete time Werndl (2009a, Sec-\ntion 4) showed that several deterministic systems in science are \u03b5-congruent for all \u03b5 > 0\nto discrete-time Markov processes (which are widespread in science). However, this left\nopen whether continuous-time deterministic systems in science can be \u03b5-congruent for all\n\u03b5 > 0 to continuous-time stochastic processes in science. Indeed, Werndl\u2019s (2009a) results\non Markov processes do not carry over to continuous time because, as explained at the end\nof Subsection 4.2, deterministic systems in science cannot yield continuous-time Markov\nprocesses.\nTheorem 3 Let (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, Tt) be a continuous Bernoulli system. Then for every finite-\nvalued observation function \u03a6 and every \u03b5 > 0 there is an n such that an n-step semi-\nMarkov process strongly (\u03a6, \u03b5)-simulates (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, Tt).\nFor a proof see Ornstein and Weiss (1991, 94\u201395).\nTheorem 4 Let (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, Tt) be a continuous Bernoulli system. Then for every finite-\nvalued observation function \u03a6 and every \u03b5 > 0 a semi-Markov process {Zt, t \u2208 R} weakly\n(\u03a6, \u03b5)-simulates (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, Tt).\nFor a proof, see Subsection 8.3.\nFor instance, consider a billiard system with convex obstacles (Example 1). According\nto Theorem 2, the solutions of such a billiard system are shadowed by the realisations of a\nsemi-Markov process for any accuracy \u03b5. According to Theorem 3, such a billiard system,\nobserved with any finite-valued observation function, is observationally equivalent to an\nn-step semi-Markov process (disregarding differences in probabilistic predictions of less\nthan \u03b5). According to Theorem 4, such a billiard system, observed with any finite-valued\nobservation function, gives the same predictions as some observed semi-Markov process\n(disregarding differences in probabilistic predictions of less than \u03b5).\nConsequently, I conclude that the answer to the question advanced at the beginning of\nthis section is positive: there are deterministic systems in science which are observationally\nequivalent to stochastic processes in science at every observation level. Compared to the\n14(M,dM ) is separable iff there is a countable set M\u02dc = {mn |n \u2208 N} with mn \u2208 M such that every\nnonempty open subset of M contains at least one element of M\u02dc .\n18\nresults in Section 4 these results are stronger because there is observational equivalence at\nevery observation level (and not just for some observation).15 Note that the increase in\nstrength is very different for the move from the first to the second results (observational\nequivalence not just to abstract mathematical descriptions but between descriptions in\nscience) and for the move from the second to the third results (observational equivalence\nbetween descriptions in science at every, and not just at some, observation level). The\nthird results imply that arguments that the evidence favours a deterministic description\nfail when they rely on the premise that fine-enough observations of deterministic systems\nin science yield probability distributions different from the ones of stochastic processes in\nscience. And for this reason the argument advanced at the beginning of this subsection\nfails. This, of course, is not to claim that there can be no sound arguments for preferring\na deterministic or stochastic description, but just that arguments based on alleged general\ndifferences between probability distributions of deterministic and stochastic descriptions\nin science will not work.16\nIn this context note the following. Assume one wants to find out, by applying obser-\nvation functions, whether the evidence favours a deterministic or stochastic description.\nAccording to Theorem 3, certain deterministic systems are observationally equivalent at\nevery observation level to n-step semi-Markov processes. Scientists use n-step semi-Markov\nprocesses in many contexts (from physics and biology to the social sciences) where they\ndo not, and we think it is rational that they do not, automatically conclude that this in-\ndicates a deterministic description. Thus it is plausible to argue that n-step semi-Markov\nprocesses do not indicate deterministic descriptions. Still, n-step semi-Markov processes\nshow correlations in the following sense: the next outcome depends on the past n outcomes,\nnot only on the previous outcome. Suppose that, because of this, n-step semi-Markov pro-\ncesses are taken to indicate a deterministic description. Then one still cannot conclude that\nfine-enough observations of Bernoulli systems indicate deterministic descriptions. This is\nso because all one needs is that the observed probability distributions could derive from\nstochastic process showing no correlations. And, according to Theorem 4, all observations\ncould derive from semi-Markov processes, where the next outcome depends only on the\npast outcome and thus there are no such correlations.17\nAll in all, the results on observational equivalence are stronger than what one might\nhave expected: observational equivalence holds even between deterministic and stochastic\ndescriptions found in science at every observation level.\n6 Previous Philosophical Discussion\nThere are hardly any philosophical reflections in the mathematics literature on observa-\ntional equivalence. Because I discussed the continuous-time results, I can comment on the\nmain exception:\n15The results here concern the same kind of descriptions as in Section 4, namely continuous Bernoulli\nsystems, semi-Markov processes and n-step semi-Markov processes.\n16The question of which description is preferable is an interesting one but requires another paper. Werndl\n(2011) is a paper devoted to this question.\n17It seems worth noting that for the semi-Markov processes of Theorem 4 any arbitrary outcome will\nbe followed by at least two different outcomes. And for many Bernoulli systems any of these semi-Markov\nprocesses is such that none of the transition probabilities is close to 0 or 1 (see Subsection 8.3).\n19\nOur theorem [Theorem 2] also tells us that certain semi-Markov systems could\nbe thought of as being produced by Newton\u2019s laws (billiards seen through a\ndeterministic viewer) or by coin-flipping. This may mean that there is no\nphilosophical distinction between processes governed by roulette wheels and\nprocesses governed by Newton\u2019s laws. {The popular literature emphasises the\ndistinction between \u201cdeterministic chaos\u201d and \u201creal randomness\u201d.} In this con-\nnection we should note that our model for a stationary process (\u00a7 1.2) [the\ndeterministic representation] means that random processes have a determinis-\ntic model. This model, however, is abstract, and there is no reason to believe\nthat it can be endowed with any special additional structure. Our point is\nthat we are comparing, in a strong sense, Newton\u2019s laws and coin flipping.18\n(Ornstein and Weiss 1991, 39\u201340)\nIt is hard to tell what this comment expresses because it is vague and unclear.19 For in-\nstance, why do Ornstein and Weiss highlight coin flipping even though Theorem 2 does not\ntell us anything about coin flipping (Bernoulli processes) but only about semi-Markov pro-\ncesses? Disregarding that, possibly, Ornstein and Weiss think that semi-Markov processes\nare random and hence claim that both deterministic and stochastic descriptions can be\nrandom. This is widely acknowledged in philosophy (e.g., Eagle 2005). Or maybe Ornstein\nand Weiss (1991) want to say that deterministic systems in science, when observed with\nspecific observation functions, can be observationally equivalent to stochastic processes in\nscience or, if semi-Markov processes are random, even random processes.20 This is true and\nimportant. However, as discussed in Section 4, this was generally known before Theorem 2\nwas proven and has been established by theorems which are weaker than Theorem 2. One\nmight have expected Ornstein and Weiss (1991) to say that Theorem 2 shows what I argued\nthat it does, namely that deterministic systems in science are observationally equivalent\nat every observation level to stochastic processes in science (cf. Subsection 5.2). But they\ndo not seem to say this: because, if they did, it would be unclear why the deterministic\nrepresentation is mentioned; also, they do not talk about all possible observation levels.\nIn any case, even if Theorem 2 establishes observational equivalence, it is not true that\n\u201cthis may mean that there is no philosophical distinction between processes governed by\nroulette wheels and processes governed by Newton\u2019s laws\u201d in the sense that there is no\nconceptual distinction between deterministic and indeterministic descriptions. Regardless\nof any results on observational equivalence, this distinction remains.\nIn the philosophy literature the significance of Theorem 2 is taken to be that (at every\nobservation level) there is a choice between a deterministic description in science and a\nstochastic process: \u201cWhat is fundamental is that [...] we are in a position to choose either\nbetween a deterministic or stochastic model\u201d (Suppes and de Barros 1996, 196). \u201cThe\nfact that a Bernoulli flow can be partitioned in such a way as to yield a (semi-) Markov\nprocess illustrates what has been acknowledged all along: Some deterministic systems,\nwhen partitioned, generate stochastic processes\u201d (Winnie 1998, 317).\n18The text in braces is in a footnote.\n19Ornstein and Weiss are mathematicians and not philosophers. So one should not blame them for\nmisguided philosophical claims. Still, one needs to know whether their philosophical claims are tenable;\nthus I criticise them.\n20If (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, Tt) and a semi-Markov process {Zt; t \u2208 R} are \u03b5-congruent, there is a finite-valued \u03a6\nsuch that {\u03a6(Tt); t \u2208 R} is {Zt; t \u2208 R} (cf. Subsection 5.1).\n20\nTheorem 2 indeed implies that there is a choice (at every observation level) between\ndeterministic descriptions in science and stochastic descriptions. Yet note that this is\nalready shown by the first level (cf. Subsection 3.1). For Theorem 1 already shows that for\nevery finite-valued observation function there is a choice between a nontrivial stochastic or a\ndeterministic description. This implies that, according to our first notion, the deterministic\nsystems to which Theorem 1 applies are observationally equivalent at every observation\nlevel to nontrivial stochastic processes. Formally:\nProposition 1 Let (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, Tt) be a measure-preserving deterministic system where\n(M,dM) is separable and where \u03a3M contains all open sets of (M,dM). Assume that\n(M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, Tt) satisfies the assumption of Theorem 1 and has finite KS-entropy.\n21 Then\nfor every \u03b5 > 0 there is a stochastic process {Zt; t \u2208 R} with outcome space MO = \u222ahl=1ol,\nh \u2208 N, such that {Zt; t \u2208 R} is \u03b5-congruent to (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, Tt), and for all k \u2208 R+ there\nare oi, oj \u2208MO such that 0 < P{Zt+k=oj |Zt=oi} < 1.\nThis proposition is easy to establish (see Subsection 8.4). And, clearly, according to the\nsecond and third notion, every deterministic system (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, Tt) to which Theorem 1\napplies is observationally equivalent at every observation level to nontrivial stochastic pro-\ncesses. This is so because the second and third notion quantifies over all finite-valued\nobservations \u03a6, and {\u03a6(Tt); t \u2208 R} is nontrivial by Theorem 1. Thus {\u03a6(Tt); t \u2208 R}\nstrongly and weakly (\u03a6, \u03b5)-simulates (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, Tt) for every \u03b5 > 0.\nThe significance of a theorem is constituted by the new knowledge added and by the\nconclusions shown by the theorem that have not already been shown by weaker theorems.\nAs just explained, that there is a choice between deterministic and stochastic descriptions\nfollows from much weaker theorems than Theorem 2 and was known to the community\nlong before Theorem 2 was proven. Consequently, the choice (at every observation level)\nbetween a deterministic description in science and a stochastic description cannot be the\nsignificance of Theorem 2. Instead, its significance is that deterministic systems in science\nare observationally equivalent at every observation level even to stochastic processes of the\nkinds found in science.22\nMoreover, Suppes and de Barros (1996, 198\u2013200) and Suppes (1999, 189, 192) seem\nto think that what it means for a deterministic system to be \u03b5-congruent to a certain\ntype of stochastic process for every \u03b5 > 0 (the first notion of observational equivalence) is\nthat the system observed with any finite-valued observation function yields a process of a\ncertain type: \u201cwe can form a finite partition [...] of the phase space of possible trajectories\u201d\n(Suppes 1999, 189). That is, they seem to think that the first notion of observational\nequivalence expresses something like my second notion. But, as discussed in Subsection 5.1,\nthe first and the second notion are quite different (e.g., only the latter tells us what happens\nif any arbitrary finite-valued observation function is applied).\n21Deterministic systems in science have finite KS-entropy (Ornstein and Weiss 1991, 19).\n22Suppes (1999, 182) and Winnie (1998, 317) similarly claim that the philosophical significance of the\nresult that some discrete-time systems are \u03b5-congruent for all \u03b5 > 0 to discrete-time Markov processes is\nthat there is a choice between deterministic and stochastic descriptions. Werndl (2009a, Section 4.2.2)\nalready criticised that these claims are too weak but did not explain why (so I did this here).\n21\n7 Conclusion\nThis paper presented and philosophically assessed three types of results on the observational\nequivalence of deterministic and indeterministic descriptions. These results were about\ncontinuous-time measure-theoretic deterministic systems and stochastic processes, which\nare ubiquitous in science. The main contribution of this paper was to show that there are\nresults on observational equivalence for continuous-time descriptions of increasing strength\n(namely, about descriptions in science and for every observation level) and to assess their\nphilosophical significance and consequences.\nThe first results were about observational equivalence to abstract mathematical descrip-\ntions. I showed how, when starting with deterministic systems, one finds observationally\nequivalent stochastic processes, and conversely. The second results were stronger in the\nsense that they were not about observational equivalence to abstract mathematical de-\nscriptions but showed observational equivalence between descriptions of the types found in\nscience. They establish, e.g., that billiard systems with convex obstacles are observationally\nequivalent to semi-Markov processes. Here I also discussed Kolmogorov\u2019s failed attempt to\nseparate deterministic systems in science from deterministic systems which yield stochas-\ntic processes in science. Compared to the second results, the third results were stronger\nbecause they concerned observational equivalence between descriptions in science at every\n(and not just at some) observation level. I introduced two new meanings of \u2018observational\nequivalence at every observation level\u2019. And I showed that deterministic systems in science\ncan be observationally equivalent even at every observation level to stochastic processes in\nscience. For example, billiard systems with convex obstacles are observationally equivalent\nat every observation level to semi-Markov or n-step semi-Markov processes.\nA consequence of these results is as follows. Suppose one wants to find out whether\na phenomenon is best described as deterministic or stochastic. Then one might think of\narguing that there is evidence for a deterministic or stochastic description by appealing to\nthe difference between the probability distributions of stochastic processes in science and\nthe probability distributions of (possibly fine-enough) observations of deterministic systems\nin science. The results of this paper showed that such arguments fail because there is no\ngeneral difference between the respective probability distributions.\nWhat, then, can we say about the question of whether the deterministic or indeter-\nministic description is preferable? Let me briefly outline my view on this issue. For a\nthorough treatment, the reader is referred to Werndl (2011). Generally, the answer to\nthis question will vary: in some contexts the deterministic description, in others the in-\ndeterministic description might be preferable, and in still other contexts there might be\nunderdetermination. But I argue that there is a clear answer for the specific case of the\nchoice between a deterministic description D which follows from Newtonian mechanics and\nan indeterministic description I which does not follow from any theory. This includes the\nmain example considered by the extant literature, namely the Newtonian deterministic\ndescription of the billiard ball and the corresponding stochastic description which does not\nfollow from any theory. Here the same probabilistic predictions follow from D and I. Still,\nthere are many descriptions in Newtonian mechanics which are not derivable from D or I\nand which are supported by evidence. Because of the unifying power of Newtonian me-\nchanics, these descriptions provide indirect evidence for D but not for the indeterministic\ndescription I. Hence, for these specific cases, indirect evidence provides a reason to prefer\n22\nthe deterministic description.\n8 Appendix\n8.1 Semi-Markov and n-step Semi-Markov Processes\nFirst, we need the following definition.\nDefinition 9 A discrete stochastic process {Zt; t \u2208 Z} is a family of random variables\nZt, t \u2208 Z, from a probability space (\u2126,\u03a3\u2126, \u03bd) to a measurable space (M\u00af,\u03a3M\u00af).\nSemi-Markov and n-step semi-Markov processes are defined via Markov and n-step Markov\nprocesses (for a definition of these well-known processes, see Doob (1953), where it is also\nexplained what it means for these processes to be irreducible and aperiodic).\nA semi-Markov process23 is defined with help of a discrete stochastic process\n{(Sk, Tk), k \u2208 Z}. {Sk; k \u2208 Z} describes the successive outcomes si visited by the semi-\nMarkov process, where at time 0 the outcome is S0. T0 is the time interval after which\nthere is the first jump of the semi-Markov process after the time 0, T\u22121 is the time interval\nafter which there is the last jump of the process before time 0, and all other Tk similarly de-\nscribe the time-intervals between jumps of the process. Because at time 0 the semi-Markov\nprocess is in S0 and the process is in S0 for the time u(S0), T\u22121 = u(S0)\u2212 T0.\nTechnically, {(Sk, Tk), k \u2208 Z} satisfies the following conditions: (i) Sk\u2208S={s1, . . . , sN},\nN \u2208 N; Tk \u2208 U = {u1, . . . , uN\u00af}, N\u00af \u2208 N, N\u00af \u2264 N , for k 6= 0,\u22121, where ui \u2208 R+, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 N\u00af ;\nT0 \u2208 (0, u(S0)], T\u22121 \u2208 [0, u(S0)), where u : S \u2192 U, si \u2192 u(si), is surjective; and hence\nM\u00af = S\u00d7[0,maxi ui]; (ii) \u03a3M\u00af = P(S)\u00d7L([0,maxi ui]), where L([0,maxi ui]) is the Lebesgue\n\u03c3-algebra on [0,maxi ui]; (iii) {Sk; k \u2208 Z} is a stationary irreducible and aperiodic Markov\nprocess with outcome space S; psi = P{S0 = si} > 0, for all i, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 N ; (iv) Tk = u(Sk)\nfor k \u2265 1, Tk = u(Sk\u22121) for k \u2264 \u22122, and T\u22121 = u(S0) \u2212 T0; (v) for all i, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 N ,\nP (T0 \u2208 A |S0 = si) =\n\u222b\nA\n1\/u(si)d\u03bb for all A \u2208 L((0, u(si)]), where L((0, u(si)]) is the\nLebesgue \u03c3-algebra and \u03bb is the Lebesgue measure on (0, u(si)].\nDefinition 10 A semi-Markov process is a process {Zt; t \u2208 R} with outcome space S\nconstructed via a process {(Sk, Tk), k \u2208 Z} as follows:\nZt =S0 for \u2212 T\u22121 \u2264 t < T0,\nZt =Sk for T0 + . . .+ Tk\u22121 \u2264 t < T0 + . . .+ Tk; k \u2265 1 and thus t \u2265 T0,\nZt =S\u2212k for\u2212T\u22121\u2212. . .\u2212T\u2212k\u22121 \u2264 t <\u2212T\u22121\u2212. . .\u2212T\u2212k; k \u2265 1 and thus t <\u2212T\u22121,\nand for all i, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 N ,\nP (Z0 = si) =\npsiu(si)\nps1u(s1) + . . .+ psNu(sN)\n. (2)\nSemi-Markov processes are stationary (Ornstein 1970 and 1974, 56\u201361). In this paper\nI assume that the elements of U are irrationally related (ui and uj are irrationally related\n23The term \u2018semi-Markov process\u2019 is not defined unambiguously.

(3)\nDefinition 14 \u03b1 = {\u03b11, . . . , \u03b1n}, n \u2208 N, is a partition of (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5) iff \u03b1i \u2208 \u03a3M , \u00b5(\u03b1i) >\n0, for all i, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, \u03b1i \u2229 \u03b1j = \u2205 for all i 6= j, 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n, and M =\n\u22c3n\ni=1 \u03b1i.\nA partition is nontrivial iff n \u2265 2. Given two partitions \u03b1 = {\u03b11, . . . , \u03b1n} and \u03b2 =\n{\u03b21, . . . , \u03b2l} of (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5), \u03b1\u2228\u03b2 is the partition {\u03b1i\u2229\u03b2j | i = 1, . . . , n; j = 1, . . . , l}. Given\na deterministic system (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, Tt), if \u03b1 is a partition, Tt\u03b1 = {Tt(\u03b11), . . . , Tt(\u03b1n)}, t \u2208 R,\nis also a partition.\nNote that any finite-valued observation function \u03a6 (cf.

Cornfeld et al. 1982, 179).\n25 It suffices to\nprove the following:\n24Again, the term \u2018n-step semi-Markov process\u2019 is not used unambiguously; I follow Ornstein and Weiss\n(1991).\n25That is, \u03c7A(m) = 1 for m \u2208 A and 0 otherwise.\n24\n(\u2217) Iff for (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, Tt) there does not exist an n \u2208 R+ and a C \u2208 \u03a3M ,\n0 < \u00b5(C) < 1, such that, esmz., Tn(C) = C, then the following holds: for\nany nontrivial partition \u03b1 = {\u03b11, . . . , \u03b1r}, r \u2208 N, and all k \u2208 R+ there is an\ni \u2208 {1, . . . , r} such that for all j, 1\u2264j\u2264r, \u00b5(Tk(\u03b1i)\\\u03b1j)>0.\nFor finite-valued observation functions are of the form\n\u2211r\nl=1 ol\u03c7\u03b1l(m), where \u03b1 = {\u03b11, . . . , \u03b1r}\nis a partition and MO = \u222arl=1ol. Consequently, the right hand side of (\u2217) expresses that for\nany nontrivial finite-valued \u03a6 : M \u2192MO and all k \u2208 R+ there is an oi \u2208MO such that for\nall oj \u2208 MO, P{Zt+k = oj |Zt = oi} < 1, or equivalently, that there are oi, oj \u2208 MO with\n0 < P{Zt+k=oj |Zt=oi} < 1.\n\u21d0: Assume that there is an n \u2208 R+ and a C \u2208 \u03a3M , 0 < \u00b5(C) < 1, such that,\nesmz., Tn(C) = C.

Let\n(\u2126,\u03a3\u2126, \u00b5\u2126, V,\u039e0), \u039e0(\u03c9) =\n\u2211N\ni=1 si\u03c7\u03b2i(\u03c9), where \u03b2 is a partition, be the deterministic\nrepresentation of {Sk; k \u2208 Z}, the irreducible and aperiodic n-step Markov process cor-\nresponding to {Yt; t \u2208 R}. Let f : \u2126 \u2192 {u1, . . . , uN}, f(\u03c9) = u(\u039e0(\u03c9)). Define K\nas \u222aNi=1Ki = \u222aNi=1(\u03b2i \u00d7 [0, u(si))). Let \u03a3Ki , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 N , be the product \u03c3-algebra\n(\u03a3\u2126 \u2229 \u03b2i) \u00d7 L([0, u(si))) where L([0, u(si))) is the Lebesgue \u03c3-algebra of [0, u(si)). Let\n\u00b5Ki be the product measure\n(\u00b5\u03a3\u2126\u2229\u03b2i\u2126 \u00d7 \u03bb([0, u(si))))\/\nN\u2211\nj=1\nu(sj)\u00b5\u2126(\u03b2j), (4)\nwhere \u03bb([0, u(si))) is the Lebesgue measure on [0, u(si)) and \u00b5\n\u03a3\u2126\u2229\u03b2i\n\u2126 is the measure \u00b5\u2126\nrestricted to \u03a3\u2126\u2229\u03b2i. Let \u03a3K be the \u03c3-algebra generated by \u222aNi=1\u03a3Ki . Define a pre-measure\n\u00b5\u00afK on H = (\u222aNi=1(\u03a3\u2126\u2229\u03b2i\u00d7L([0, si))))\u222aK by \u00b5\u00afK(K) = 1 and \u00b5\u00afK(A) = \u00b5Ki(A) for A \u2208 \u03a3Ki ,\nand let \u00b5K be the unique extension of this pre-measure to a measure on \u03a3K . Finally, Rt is\ndefined as follows: let the state of the system at time zero be (k, v) \u2208 K, k \u2208 \u2126, v < f(k);\nthe state moves vertically with unit velocity, and just before it reaches (k, f(k)) it jumps\nto (V (k), 0) at time f(k) \u2212 v; then it again moves vertically with unit velocity, and just\nbefore it reaches (V (k), f(V (k)))) it jumps to (V 2(k), 0) at time f(V (k)) + f(k)\u2212 v, and\nso on. (K,\u03a3K , \u00b5K , Rt) is a measure-preserving system (a \u2018flow built under the function\nf \u2019). (X,\u03a3X , \u00b5X ,Wt) is proven to be isomorphic (via a function \u03c8) to (K,\u03a3K , \u00b5K , Rt)\n(Park 1982).\nConsider \u03b3 = {\u03b31, . . . , \u03b3l}=\u03b2\u2228V \u03b2\u2228 . . .\u2228V n\u22121\u03b2 and \u03a0(\u03c9) =\n\u2211l\nj=1 oj\u03c7\u03b3j(\u03c9), oi 6= oj for\ni 6= j, 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 l. I now show that {Bt = \u03a0(V t(\u03c9)); t \u2208 Z} is an irreducible and aperiodic\nMarkov process. By construction, for all t and all i, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 l, there are qi,0, . . . , qi,n\u22121 \u2208 S\nsuch that\nP{Bt = oi} = P{St = qi,0, St+1 = qi,1, . . . , St+n\u22121 = qi,n\u22121}. (5)\nTherefore, for all k \u2208 N and all i, j1, . . . , jk, 1 \u2264 i, j1, . . . , jk \u2264 l:\nP{Bt+1 = oi |Bt = oj1 , . . . , Bt\u2212k+1 = ojk} = (6)\nP{St+1=qi,0,..., St+n=qi,n\u22121|St=qj1,0,..., St+n\u22121=qi,n\u22122,St\u22121=qj2,0,..., St\u2212k+1=qjk,0}\n= P{St+1 = qi,0, . . . , St+n = qi,n\u22121 |St = qj1,0, . . . , St+n\u22121 = qi,n\u22122}\n= P{Bt+1 = oi |Bt = oj1},\nif P{Bt+1 = oi, Bt = oj1 , . . . , Bt\u2212k+1 = ojk} > 0. Hence {Bt; t \u2208 Z} is a Markov process.\nNow a discrete measure-preserving deterministic system (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, T ) is mixing iff for all\nA,B \u2208 \u03a3M\nlim\nt\u2192\u221e\n\u00b5(T t(A) \u2229B) = \u00b5(A)\u00b5(B). (7)\nThe deterministic representation of every irreducible and aperiodic n-step Markov process,\nand hence (\u2126,\u03a3\u2126, \u00b5\u2126, V,\u039e0), is mixing (Ornstein 1974, 45\u201347). This implies that {Bt; t \u2208\nZ} is irreducible and aperiodic.\nLet \u2206(k) =\n\u2211l\ni=1 oi\u03c7\u03b3i\u00d7[0,u(oi))(k), where u(oi), 1 \u2264 i \u2264 l, is defined as follows: u(oi) =\nu(sr) where \u03b3i \u2286 \u03b2r. It follows immediately that {Xt = \u2206(Rt); t \u2208 R} is a semi-Markov\n26\nprocess. Consider the surjective function \u03a8 : M \u2192 {o1, . . . , ol}, \u03a8(m) = \u2206(\u03c8(\u03c6(m))) for\nm \u2208 M\u02c6 and o1 otherwise. Recall that (X,\u03a3X , \u00b5X ,Wt) is a factor (via \u03c6) of (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, Tt)\nand that (X,\u03a3X , \u00b5X ,Wt) is isomorphic (via \u03c8) to (K,\u03a3K , \u00b5K , Rt). Therefore, {Zt =\n\u03a8(Tt); t \u2208 R} is a semi-Markov process with outcomes oi and times u(oi), 1 \u2264 i \u2264 l.\nNow consider the surjective observation function \u0393 : {o1, . . . , ol} \u2192 S, where \u0393(oi) = sr\nfor \u03b3i \u2286 \u03b2r, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 l. By construction, esmz., \u0393(\u03a8(Tt(m))) = \u0398(Tt(m)) = Yt(m) for\nall t \u2208 R. Hence, because {Yt; t \u2208 R} strongly (\u03a6, \u03b5)-simulates (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, Tt), \u00b5({m \u2208\nM |\u0393(\u03a8(m)) 6= \u03a6(m)}) < \u03b5.\n8.4 Proof of Proposition 1\nProposition 1 Let (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, Tt) be a measure-preserving deterministic system where\n(M,dM) is separable and where \u03a3M contains all open sets of (M,dM). Assume that\n(M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, Tt) satisfies the assumption of Theorem 1 and has finite KS-entropy. Then\nfor every \u03b5 > 0 there is a stochastic process {Zt; t \u2208 R} with outcome space MO = \u222ahl=1ol,\nh \u2208 N, such that {Zt; t \u2208 R} is \u03b5-congruent to (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, Tt), and for all k \u2208 R+ there\nare oi, oj \u2208MO such that 0 < P{Zt+k=oj |Zt=oi} < 1.\nProof : A partition \u03b1 (cf. Definition 14) is generating for the discrete measure-preserving\nsystem (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, T ) iff for every A \u2208 \u03a3M there is an n \u2208 N and a set C of unions of\nelements in \u2228nj=\u2212nT j(\u03b1) such that \u00b5((A \\ C) \u222a (C \\ A)) < \u03b5 (Petersen 1983, 244). \u03b1 is\ngenerating for the measure-preserving system (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, Tt) iff for all A \u2208 \u03a3M there is\na \u03c4 \u2208 R+ and a set C of unions of elements in \u22c3all m\u22c2\u03c4t=\u2212\u03c4 (T\u2212t(\u03b1(T t(m)))) such that\n\u00b5((A \\ C) \u222a (C \\ A)) < \u03b5 (\u03b1(m) is the set \u03b1j \u2208 \u03b1 with m \u2208 \u03b1j).\nBy assumption, there is a t0 \u2208 R+ such that the discrete system (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, Tt0) is\nergodic (cf. Definition 13). For discrete ergodic systems Krieger\u2019s (1970) theorem implies\nthat there is a partition \u03b1 which is generating for (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, Tt0) and hence generating\nfor (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, Tt). Since (M,dM) is separable, for every \u03b5 > 0 there is a r \u2208 N and\nmi \u2208 M , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 r, such that \u00b5(M \\ \u222ari=1B(mi, \u03b52)) < \u03b52 . Because \u03b1 is generating for\n(M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, Tt0), for each B(mi,\n\u03b5\n2\n) there is an ni \u2208 N and a Ci of union of elements in\n\u2228nij=\u2212niTjt0(\u03b1) such that \u00b5((B(mi, \u03b52) \\ Ci) \u222a (Ci \\ B(mi, \u03b52))) < \u03b52r . Let n= max{ni}, \u03b2=\n{\u03b21, . . . , \u03b2l}= \u2228nj=\u2212nTjt0(\u03b1) and \u03a8(m) =\n\u2211l\ni=1 oi\u03c7\u03b2i(m) with oi \u2208 \u03b2i. Since \u03a8 is a finite-\nvalued, Theorem 1 implies that for the process {\u03a8(Tt); t \u2208 R} for all k \u2208 R+ there are\noi, oj such that 0 < P{Zt+k=oj |Zt=oi} < 1. Because \u03b1 is generating for (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, Tt),\n\u03b2 is generating too. This implies that (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, Tt) is isomorphic (via a function \u03c6) to\nthe deterministic representation (M2,\u03a3M2 , \u00b52, T\n2\nt ,\u03a60) of {Zt; t \u2208 R} (Petersen 1983, 274).\nAnd, by construction, dM(m,\u03a60(\u03c6(m))) < \u03b5 except for a set in M smaller than \u03b5.\nAcknowledgements\nI am indebted to Jeremy Butterfield and Jos Uffink for valuable suggestions and stimulating\ndiscussion on previous versions of this manuscript.
