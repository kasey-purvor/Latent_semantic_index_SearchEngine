Such information is not only of interest to\necologists, but also to the medical field of cryobiology\nwith implications for the preservation of cells and tissues\nat low temperatures [2]. Within the Hexopoda, the Colle-\nmbola (springtails) are particularly well studied [3,4].\nThey possess three main strategies to survive the cold:\nfreeze tolerance, freeze avoidance and cryoprotective\ndehydration [4-6]. Whilst most cold tolerant springtails\nuse freeze avoidance, one species, the Arctic springtail\nMegaphorura arctica (Tullberg) utilises the relatively novel\nstrategy known as cryoprotective dehydration. In this\nprocess loss of water occurs across a diffusion gradient\nbetween the animal's super-cooled body fluids and ice in\nits surroundings, such that freezing point depression\nalways exceeds the environmental temperature. Eventu-\nally the animals lose sufficient water to ensure that a freez-\ning event cannot occur and the animals enter a state\napproaching anhydrobiosis [6,7]. To date, the only other\nanimals this process has been described in is in the\ncocoons of the earthworm Dendrobaena octaedra [7], the\nAntarctic nematode Panagrolaimus davidi [8], an\nenchytraied worm [9] and the larvae of the Antarctic\nmidge Belgica antarctica [10].\nThe physiological mechanisms underlying cryoprotective\ndehydration have been well characterised in M. arctica [6].\nThese include dehydration through a highly permeable\ncuticle, accumulation of trehalose as a cryoprotectant\n[6,11,12] and changes in membrane phospholipid fatty\nacid composition [13]. Trehalose accumulation has also\nbeen documented in the nematode [8]. In other species\ndesiccation tolerance has also been correlated with these\ncellular processes [14-16], but additionally with redistri-\nbution of osmolytes [17] and accumulation and synergis-\ntic colligative effects of amino acids [18]. Gene expression\nchanges have also been identified such as up-regulation of\nthe heat shock protein genes Hsp23, Hsp70 and Hsp104\n[19,20] and also genes encoding a ferritin homologue\n[21], the desiccation-associated LEA family [22], fibrino-\ngen, mitochondrial transporters, acidic ribosomal phos-\nphoprotein P0, phosphoglycerate kinase and the\nribosomal protein RPL7 [[23] and references therein]. In\naddition, protein phosphatases, protein kinase A and p38\nMAPK have been suggested as being involved in transcrip-\ntional control [24,25]. Whether these processes or genes\nare potentially involved in cryoprotective dehydration in\nM. arctica is, as yet, unknown, but they do provide poten-\ntial targets for further investigation. However it should be\nnoted that the examples quoted above include a wide tax-\nonomic range (from yeast through to frogs) and also dif-\nferent dehydration or desiccation tolerant mechanisms,\nmainly diapause and rapid cold hardening, between\nwhich, even with the limited molecular investigations to\ndate, there are documented differences in gene expression\nbetween species [26]. Currently nothing is known about\nthe transcriptional and translational processes affecting\nsurvival of M. arctica at low temperatures.\nIn order to address this lack of data, we have generated\nand screened a custom-made M. arctica microarray. Previ-\nously we described an EST project of 16,379 clones gener-\nated from M. arctica in different dehydration states [27]. A\nsub-set of these clones (6,912) formed the basis for the\nproduction of the microarray used in this article. The aim\nwas to identify the underlying gene expression pathways\ninvolved in cryoprotective dehydration in this organism\nand determine whether these pathways were exclusively\nup-regulated in response to cold dehydration. To this end\nthe microarray was hybridized with RNA extracted from\nanimals that had been treated under different regimes of\nboth cold and salt-induced dehydration. We present the\nfirst comprehensive microarray analysis of the transcrip-\ntional responses underlying the cryoprotective dehydra-\ntion process.\nResults and discussion\nAnimals were treated according to five protocols, the\nresults from each of which were compared with control\nanimals maintained at +5\u00b0C:\n\u2022 -2\u00b0C animals were cold dehydrated to -2\u00b0C.\n\u2022 -7\u00b0C animals were cold dehydrated to -7\u00b0C.\n\u2022 H18 were -7\u00b0C animals left to recover at +5\u00b0C for 18\nhours.\n\u2022 0.9 salt were dehydrated in a reduced humidity\natmosphere at +5\u00b0C to a water content of 0.9 g\/g dry\nweight.\n\u2022 0.2 salt were dehydrated as above, but to a water con-\ntent of 0.2 g\/g dry weight.\nIn all cases, survival of the animals after dehydration treat-\nment was monitored. The\n-2\u00b0C animals could still be seen to move and only living\nsamples were selected and flash frozen. When the animals\nwere subjected to salt and -7\u00b0C dehydration, it was still\npossible to see which animals were alive and had success-\nfully undergone \"protective dehydration\". They were\ndarker in colour and smaller (shrivelled). However, a sub-\nsample of these selected animals was taken back to +5\u00b0C\nwith water and they all survived. Some animals did not\nsuccessfully enter the dehydrated state and therefore died.Page 2 of 19\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Genomics 2009, 10:328 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/10\/328They looked very different: long and distended and so\nwere easy to distinguish.\nAnalysis of the microarray results showed large-scale\nchanges in gene expression over all treatments. This\nranged from 7.4% of the genes being up-regulated with\nthe -2\u00b0C treatment to 16.1% up-regulated with the 18\nhour recovery (Table 1). When down regulated genes are\nalso considered, the total percentage of genes changing\nexpression levels increased to 10.8% and 32.4% respec-\ntively. In many ways this is not surprising, given that since\nM. arctica is so small, the survey of response to change has\nto be carried out at the whole organism level and this\nresults in dramatic morphological and biochemical\nchanges. The body of M. arctica effectively shrivels to a\nfraction of its former volume as the total water content of\nthe animal reduces from 70% to 40% of fresh weight,\nmost of which is due to the loss of osmotically active\nwater and the animal becoming almost anhydrobiotic\n[12] (Figure 1). This process is accompanied by produc-\ntion of the disaccharide trehalose as a cryoprotectant, with\ntemperatures of between 0\u00b0C and -2\u00b0C appearing to act as\nthe tipping point for trehalose synthesis (Figure 2). Such\nchanges are clearly not the result of the action of a few\ngenes. However the problem arises as to how to analyse\nsuch a dynamic dataset to produce an overview of the\ntranscriptional processes involved and therefore narrow\ndown areas for future research. This is more difficult in a\nnon-model species given that assignment of putative func-\ntionality via BLAST sequence similarity searching was only\nachieved in 42\u201357% of ESTs (Table 1).\nTo facilitate description of the processes, the analysis is\npresented in the two distinct components of dehydration\nand recovery. This is validated by hierarchical clustering\nwhich clearly shows the dehydration process as very dis-\ntinct from recovery with clear partitioning of the five\ngroups (Figure 3). Within the dehydration strategies, the\n0.9 salt expression profiles cluster most closely with the -\n2\u00b0C group and the 0.2 salt with the -7\u00b0C group, which\nwould be expected on the basis of water content, if the\nmolecular processes involved are similar in both cold and\nsalt dehydration.\nGene ontology overview\nTo establish an initial overview of the processes involved\nand to potentially differentiate between cold and salt\ndehydration stresses, GO and GO Slim ontology enrich-\nment analyses were used. When GO Slim (Molecular\nFunction) was used to compare gene ontology in control\nanimals compared with those treated at -7\u00b0C and also\nthose of the 0.2 salt group, there was virtually no differ-\nence in the relative partitioning between different func-\ntions (Figure 4) under the two different treatments. So\nalthough the number of up-regulated clones varied\nbetween the control animals and both cold and salt dehy-\ndration (914 and 846 respectively), the overall functions\ninvolved in the dehydration processes appear to be very\nsimilar under the two different treatments. The reason for\nGraph showing increase in trehalose content (\u03bcg\/mg fresh weight) of M. arctica with decre sing temperatureFigure 2\nGraph showing increase in trehalose content (\u03bcg\/mg \nfresh weight) of M. arctica with decreasing tempera-\nture. 0\u00b0C to -2\u00b0C \"tipping point\" is arrowed.\nTreatment temperature (\u00b0C)\n-14 -12 -10 -8 -6 -4 -2 0 2 4 6\nco\nn\nce\nn\ntra\ntio\nn\n \n(\u03bcg\n\/m\ng \nfw\nt)\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nTrehalose\nA: SEM of M. arctica in \"normal\" fully hydrated stateFigure 1\nA: SEM of M. arctica in \"normal\" fully hydrated state. \nB: SEM of M. arctica in dehydrated state.

The salt dehydration was experimentally\ninduced at a faster rate, for example approximately 8 days\nto dehydrate to 0.9 g\/g dry weight with salt compared to\n24 days to reach 1.1 g\/g dry weight with the cold treat-\nment. So the slight discrepancy in the dry weight levels,\nthe production methods used, different stresses and the\nfact that the experiments proceeded at different rates,\ncould explain differences in the fine-scale detail. Therefore\nalthough the relative fine-tuning of gene expression could\nbe affected, the same final result would be achieved in\nboth cases. Indeed previous observations suggest that des-\niccation and cryoprotective dehydration mechanisms are\nvery similar [28] and that there is overlap in tolerance\npathways to different stress factors [29-31].\nThe GO Slim analysis of the 18 hour recovery group was\nalso very similar to the dehydrated states (Figure 4). GO\nenrichment analysis comparing gene ontology in control\nanimals with the -7\u00b0C and 18 hour recovery groups (data\nnot shown) revealed no real enrichment for particular GO\ncategories. GO analysis can produce a very broad overview\nof functions and processes which change in organisms\nunder different experimental conditions. Whilst this is\nuseful and indeed can indicate potential clones to study in\nmore detail (c.f. [27]), to more accurately define what is\nhappening at the molecular level, actual gene identifica-\ntions are required. Because the expression profiles of so\nmany genes change under the different experimental sce-\nnarios used here, it was decided to analyse, in detail, the\n\"Top 20\" most highly expressed clones under each of the\ndifferent conditions (compared to the control group).\nDehydration processes using putative gene identifications\nOf the 512 clones up-regulated during the -2\u00b0C treatment,\nonly 42.1% could have some putative functionality\nassigned via BLAST sequence similarity searching (Table\n1). This is a similar percentage when the top 20 from this\nlisting are examined [Additional file 1]. Not surprisingly\nTPS is significantly up-regulated and of particular interest\nis the match to the Drosophila Mediator complex. This is\none of the central players in a class of regulatory coactiva-\ntor complexes that potentiate activated transcription and\nfine tune the transcriptional response so that it is physio-\nlogically appropriate [32]. Given that such a dramatic\nreduction occurs in water content, it is not surprising to\nfind the presence of a small heat shock protein with\nhomology to the Lethal (2) essential for life protein\n(HSP20 family) from the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes\naegypti.\nA number of clones have been designated as \"bacterial\ncontamination\" in Additional files 1, 2, 3, 4. These\nsequences all belonged to a single 2 kb contig of 14 clones\nmatching bacterial isocitrate lyase (accession number:\nA9IUW1).

In this analysis [33], putative isocitrate lyase\ngenes were described from the insects Aedes aegypti and\nAnopheles gambiae. These were designated as bacterial con-\ntamination due to an absence of introns and strong con-\nservation of amino acid sequence between the putative\nMetazoan genes and E. coli. The contig from the M. arctica\nEST collection shows high sequence identity to bacterial\nsequences (71% identity and 83% similarity at the amino\nacid level) and PCR of an 800 bp fragment from both\ngenomic DNA and cDNA revealed no difference in the\nsize of products i.e. no indication of the presence of\nintrons. Hence it was decided that this evidence strongly\nindicates that these clones were of bacterial origin, a\npotential hazard when producing ESTs and screening\nwhole animals.\nExamination of the ESTs most up-regulated at -7\u00b0C [Addi-\ntional file 2] shows a transition from energy and trehalose\nproduction to trehalose mobilisation and cellular\/skeletal\nreconstruction. Of prime interest is the match to the\nAnopheles gambiae trehalose transporter (AgTRET1,\naccession number: A9ZSY1), which according to the data-\nbase entry, is responsible for the discharge of trehalose\nfrom the fat body into the haemolymph (Kanamori et al,\nunpublished). This has been confirmed by functional\nanalysis of TRET1 in the anhydrobiotic insect, Poly-\npedilum vanderplanki [34]. The other matches to inosine\n5' monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), AKT2 (Rac\nserine\/threonine protein kinase), F-capping protein, ubiq-\nuitin carrier protein (UCP) and transcriptional endoplas-\nmic reticulum ATPase (TER94) are all either involved in\ncell growth and development, cytoskeleton or protein\nquality control. Overall this presents a picture of cellular\/\ntissue remodelling, which involves production, but also\ndegradation of protein elements. Certainly knock-out\/\nmutation experiments in both the capping protein in Dro-\nsophila and AKT in mice has resulted in severely prema-\nture death with skeletal and developmental defects\n[35,36]. Potential controlling elements in these processes\nare indicated by the continued presence of matches to the\nMediator complex and also juvenile hormone esterase, an\nenzyme regulating the levels of juvenile hormone, a key\nhormone in insect development and reproduction [37].\nGiven experimental differences and inter-experimental\nvariation, it would not be expected that the clones up-reg-\nulated in the salt dehydration experiments exactly mirror\nthose induced by cold. The gene identifications are more\ndiverse with the 0.9 salt data compared to the other exper-\niments, but do not alter radically from the trends seen pre-\nviously [Additional file 3]. There is still up-regulation of\nTPS and modification of transcription levels via the Medi-\nator complex [Additional file 3].

The latter include matches to ser-\nine\/threonine protein kinases (unc-51 from C. elegans and\nitk, a Tec-family kinase from Danio rerio). Modification of\nthe protein pool and cellular remodelling is still taking\nplace with the presence of a co-chaperonin (TCP-1), a pro-\nteasome 26s ATPase sub-unit, matches to an autophagy\nprotein from the fathead minnow and a long, if weak but\nconsistent match to a large number of uncharacterised\nproteins which include the tolloid protein from the\npacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) with a protease function\nand a nucleolysin TIAR protein, which is a cytotoxic gran-\nule associated RNA binding protein involved in targeting\napoptosis.\nDespite a relatively large number of clones with no\nsequence data in the 0.2 salt table, the same gene identifi-\ncations emerge with significant up-regulation of TPS, the\nMediator complex and the protein kinase AKT2 [Addi-\ntional file 4]. One clone, sb_009_04J09 was labelled as a\nputative transporter. This clone produced weak matches\n(39% amino acid identity) to a number of different clones\nincluding the Culex quinquifasciatus chromaffin granule\namine transporter (BOXJX9), an uncharacterised MFS-\ntype transporter (Q6NT16) in human and a novel facilita-\ntor super family protein in Xenopus tropicalis (Q07G00).\nSo although an orthologous gene was not identified, this\nclone potentially represents an interesting candidate for\nfurther analysis with a putative transporter function.\nRecovery process definition using putative gene \nidentifications\nThe profile of the ESTs associated with this treatment\n[Additional file 5] is very different to those of dehydration\nwith an emphasis on energy generation and transcription\nprocesses, but again there is an element of cytoskeletal\nreconstruction. Of primary note is an EST with sequence\nsimilarity to arginine kinase. Arginine kinase is a phos-\nphagen kinase, these enzymes are prevalent in systems\nwith fluctuating energy demands, acting as an energy buff-\nering system [38] and acts as an energy shuttle delivering\nATP generated by mitochondria to high energy requiring\nprocesses, such as membrane turnover [39], crucial when\nemerging from a dormant state. Whilst the phosphagen\nkinases are a multigene family, arginine kinase is the only\nform of this gene in arthropods and molluscs [40]. It also\nhas other functions such as buffering intracellular pH and\npreventing a rise in intracellular ADP levels that would\ntrigger multiple metabolic responses. Clearly there will\nalso be a need for M. arctica to redevelop the internal cel-\nlular structures, repairing any that have been damaged in\nthe dehydration process [41,42], hence the presence of\nputative chitin binding proteins and proteases. Alongside\nthis are matches to genes associated with the cytoskeleton\nvia microtubules and mRNA translation. These are repre-\nsented by a member of the tektin protein family (microtu-\nbule associated cytoskeletal proteins), a deep, but weak\nmatch to the eukaryotic initiation factor 4\u03b3 and an elonga-\ntion factor 1 \u03b1-like factor. The latter is a polypeptide chain\nrelease factor active during mRNA translation, but is also\ninvolved in the microtubule cytoskeleton and has been\nimplicated as playing a role in cell division [43].\nOther putative identifications have less obvious functions\nwhen considered in the light of springtail physiology,\nincluding a match to leukotriene A-4 hydrolase. This is a\ndual purpose protein with both amino peptidase and\nepoxide hydrolase activity. This gene has been well char-\nacterised in human and is involved in inflammation and\nhost defenses [44], although given the differences\nbetween humans and springtails, its exact role in M. arc-\ntica will need further analysis. There are also a couple of\nweak matches (approximately 7.0 e-09) to a high mobility\ngroup protein B1. This gene is involved in the regulation\nof transcription and interestingly was implicated as an\nimportant element in the response of Austrofundulus lim-\nnaes (annual killifish) to fluctuating daily temperatures\n[45]. The M. arctica gene is not an orthologue of this\nsequence, but such a match could imply a similarity of\nfunction.\nAs for potential hormonal control of the rehydration\nprocess, juvenile hormone is not surprisingly implicated\n(given its pleiotropic activities). There is a match to acces-\nsion number: Q5XUU6, which is described as a Take-out-\nlike carrier protein (JHBP-1) with a juvenile hormone\nbinding motif (Kucharski and Maleszka, unpub).\nAlthough this analysis was restricted to the \"Top 20\" up-\nregulated clones under each treatment, it is possible to\nidentify major changes in springtail cellular processes\nassociated with these experimental conditions (Figure 5).\nHowever, these represent restricted snapshots of gene\nexpression of processes, which range from hours (recovery\nfrom cold dehydration) to several weeks (reduction of\ntemperatures to remove all osmotically active water). They\nalso do not represent a comprehensive time course series,\nwhich could potentially add detail to the more global\nobservations made here. When considering genes that\nmay be co-regulated with anhydrobiosis, there is an obvi-\nous process, which is known to correlate with dehydration\nin the Arctic springtail; that of trehalose accumulation.\nGenes associated with trehalose metabolism\nThe process of dehydration is accompanied by a concom-\nitant increase in the levels of the carbohydrate trehalose,\nwhich is presumed to also act as a cryoprotectant in this\norganism. The levels of trehalose increase dramatically in\nthe animal when the temperature reaches -2\u00b0C and con-\ntinues as the temperature drops, reaching a plateau at -Page 6 of 19\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Genomics 2009, 10:328 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/10\/3286\u00b0C (Figure 2). During this reduction in temperature, the\ntrehalose concentration increases 100 fold from 0.9 to\n94.7 \u03bcg\/ml and is clearly a critical pathway in the dehydra-\ntion process [12]. Therefore, in order to target more accu-\nrately genes specifically involved in dehydration, clones,\nwhich co-expressed with trehalose-6-phosphate synthase\n(TPS), were identified in the microarray data analysis (Fig-\nure 6). This was complicated slightly by the identification\nof a gene duplication event for TPS.\nDuplication of TPS genes in M. arctica\nExamination of clone matches to TPS revealed 2 separate\ncontigs, representing distinct paralogues:\n\u2022 Contig 1 comprised 2 clones (sb_006_04P17 and\nsb_009_07N11) with a total length of 748 bp. BLAST\nsequence similarity searching produced database\nmatches with a score of 983, a probability of 5.7e-97\nand an 86% match to accession number A8D372 from\nLocusta migratoria malinensis (Oriental migratory\nlocust). Both of these clones were present on the\nmicroarray.\n\u2022 Contig 2 comprised 4 clones (sb_008_04E04,\nsb_006_06G01, sb_007_11P11 and sb_005_09H16\nwith a total length of 631 bp. BLAST sequence similar-\nity searching produced closest database matches to\nA3EY17, a fragment of TPS from Maconellicoccus hirsu-\ntus (pink hibiscus mealy bug). The first match to a full-\nlength sequence was to Drosophila sechellia (B4I383)\nwith a score of 413, a probability of 9.7e-36 and 66%\nidentity. Only one of these clones (sb_006_06G01)\nwas present of the microarray).\nBoth contigs overlapped the same region by the order of\n100 amino acids, sharing 42.1% identity and 57.9% sim-\nilarity at the protein level. The duplication of TPS genes in\nM. arctica mirrors the situation found in the nematode C.\nelegans [46] and the rotifer Brachionus plicatilis [47]. Direct\nsequence comparisons of the duplicated genes are diffi-\ncult between these organisms. The C. elegans sequences\nare much longer at 1229 and 1331 amino acids, com-\npared to the insect sequences (at approximately 800\namino acids), which provide the closest database matches\nto the M. arctica sequences. Both putative rotifer genes are\nfragmented with only one encompassing the same coding\nregion as the two M. arctica sequences. This fragment\nshows between 33\u201336% sequence identity at the amino\nacid level with the two springtail sequences. This low level\nof homology is not surprising as these sequence fragments\ncomprise the most 3' end of the gene, a region which is\ninvariably less conserved. This would also explain what\nappears to be the relatively low level of homology\nbetween paralogous springtail genes (42.1% identity),\ncompared with those of the rotifer which share 88.9%\nidentity, as the rotifer sequences are compared from the\nmiddle, more conserved portion of the gene. The C. ele-\ngans clones shared only 48% identity over their whole\nlength.\nAs regards the putative functionality of the duplicated TPS\ngenes; in C. elegans trehalose is also accumulated in the\nanimal in response to stressful conditions, such as heat\nshock and freezing. However, RNAi knockout experi-\nments of the two TPS genes produced no obvious short-\nterm loss of function in this organism, despite in vivo lev-\nels being reduced to 7% of normal in the double knock-\nout [46]. The rotifer (B. plicatilis) regularly survives stress-\nful conditions via the production of resting eggs which\nundergo obligatory diapause or dormancy, but trehalose\ndoes not appear to accumulate in this animal under such\nconditions [47]. However small amounts of trehalose\n(0.35% dry weight) have been found in B. plicatilis anhy-\ndrobiotic resting eggs [48], but may be acting as an\nosmotic electrolyte rather than a cryoprotective chemical\n[48]. The fact that duplicate genes for TPS exist implies a\npartitioning of function between the two paralogues [49],\nindeed as will be seen below, there is differential expres-\nsion of the two genes in M. arctica under dehyrating con-\nditions.\nSimilarly to the duplication of the TPS gene in M. arctica,\nthere appears to be (again, in line with the situation in C.\nOverview of processes involved in M. arctica dehydrated and recovering animalsFigur  5\nOverview of processes involved in M. arctica dehy-\ndrated and recovering animals.\nControl animals\nDehydrated animals\nRecover ing animals\nProduction and mobilisation of trehalose\nCellular\/tissue remodelling\nProduction of stress proteinsEnergy production\nTranslation initiation\nCell division\nCellular\/tissue remodellingPage 7 of 19\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Genomics 2009, 10:328 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/10\/328\nPage 8 of 19\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nHeat map produced via identification of genes co-regulated with TPS in all 4 dehydration treatmentsFigure 6\nHeat map produced via identification of genes co-regulated with TPS in all 4 dehydration treatments.\nBMC Genomics 2009, 10:328 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/10\/328elegans and the rotifer, B. plicatilis) a parallel duplication\nof the trehalase gene. To date there are 4 trehalase genes\nannotated in the whole genome assembly of C. elegans\n(W05E10.4, F57B10.7, T05A12.2 and C23H3.7) and 3\nputative gene fragments were identified from the rotifer\nEST project [41]. Although the EST coverage of M. arctica\nis lower than the rotifer, 3 singletons were identified as\nputative trehalase genes. These three sequences had suffi-\ncient differences (between 54.4% and 68.3% identity at\nthe amino acid level) to define them as putative para-\nlogues. To date RNAi studies in C. elegans have produced\nno obvious phenotype, so the question remains as to why\nthere are four copies of this gene in C. elegans and also\nmultiple copies in other organisms.\nESTs co-regulated with TPS\nIn total 53 ESTs were significantly co-regulated with the 3\nTPS sequences (Figure 6, Additional file 6). Of the 56\nclones, it was possible to ascribe putative function via\nBLAST homology to 26 clones (including the 3 TPS ESTs)\n(46% of total), no significant database match was identi-\nfied for 25 clones and 5 had no sequence data attached. In\neach case, assignment of putative functionality was\naccorded when probability values were in excess of 1 e-10,\nunless specifically stated in the discussion.\nPutative functions of a major sub-group of ESTs centre\naround cellular signalling and membrane trafficking. The\nADP-ribosylation-factor family (ARF) are Ras-related\nsmall GTPases that regulate intracellular trafficking by\nshuttling between an inactive GDP-bound and an active\nGTP-bound form. Two members of this family were iden-\ntified in the ESTs (ADP ribosyl factor-like protein and cen-\ntaurin \u03b1) [50,51]. Additionally SEC14 is a cytosolic\nprotein with the ability to catalyse exchange of phosphol-\nipids between membranes, acting as an essential interface\nbetween lipid metabolism and membrane trafficking in\nthe trans-golgi complex [52]. Interestingly, this gene is\nalso up-regulated in yeast stress experiments involving\nheavy metals, alkylation and temperature (c.f. [53]). Two\nESTs both show similarity to Dopamine \u03b2-monooxygen-\nase (DBM), an enzyme, which produces norepinephrine,\nwhich is stored in secretory granules and used for intracel-\nlular communication [54]. Certainly in mammals nore-\npinephrine is well known as both a stress hormone and\nneurotransmitter, although an equivalent hormone in\ninsects is as yet uncharacterised and therefore the function\nof a DBM homologue is unknown in insects.\nFour further ESTs are putatively involved in membrane\ntransport: sb_006_04L08 belonging to the cation trans-\nport ATPase family, sb_006_03D06 matching caltexin,\nwhich is a calcium activated signalling molecule, which\nmaintains a buffered intracellular Ca2+ concentration and\nis involved in the regulation of K+ channels [55],\nsb_006_03F06, a vacuolar ATPase involved in ion regula-\ntion and maintenance of homeostasis [56] and finally\nsb_009_05K08. This latter clone putatively encodes a\nmember of the solute carrier family 13, member 5 Na+\/cit-\nrate co-transporter. This family encode integral mem-\nbrane proteins that mediate the uptake of a wide variety of\nmolecules, with concomitant uptake of Na+ ions. They\nmay act in tandem with aquaporins, which given their\nfunction are clear target molecules in the dehydration\nprocess. This family 13 of transmembrane proteins have\nimportant physiological functions and may facilitate the\nutilisation of citrate for the generation of metabolic\nenergy via glycolysis and gluconeogenesis [57,58].\nGiven that TPS is involved in dehydration, it is not surpris-\ning there are BLAST matches to proteins with oxidoreduct-\nase activity, which may be involved in the stress reaction,\nsuch as ferritin and cysteine dioxygenase. A ferritin-\nderived homologue, artemin has been identified as a\nmajor component in the encystment and diapause of the\nbrine shrimp, Artemia franciscana with proposed chaper-\none activity and a stress protection role [21]. However\nartemin shows very limited identity to ferritin (20.4%\nidentity to Q6WNX4, Boophilus microplus (cattle tick)) and\nthe EST matches for M. arctica are clearly more similar\n(74% identity) to the parent ferritin gene. Cysteine dioxy-\ngenase is involved in cysteine catabolism, the relevance of\nwhich, in this situation, is unclear, but this gene has been\nshown to be up-regulated in response to stress (hypoxia)\nin the goby fish, Gillichthys mirabilis [59].\nThere are also proteins which have putative functions\ninvolving skeletal reconstruction. There are four matches\nto a chitin-binding protein in Lutzomyia longipalpis (sand\nfly) (accession number A8CWD0). This protein has been\nidentified as a peritrophin and has been shown to be\nsecreted in the mid-gut in response to feeding, but also\nhas a cytoskeletal role [60]. These may be needed to repair\ncell structure as a result of dehydration. Of the remaining\nidentifications, sb_006_08J23 shows similarity to gluta-\nmate semialdehyde dehydrogenase, which is involved in\namino acid biosynthesis, and sb_006_01B14 encodes a\ntrehalase homologue. The presence of both TPS and treha-\nlase in the same expression profile is not surprising as\nthere is presumably some measure of dynamism between\nsynthesis and breakdown of trehalose. Cathepsin B is\ninvolved in proteolysis. RNAi experiments of this gene in\nthe silk worm, Bombyx mori showed a significant role in\ntissue restructuring, being critical for metamorphosis and\nnormal development [61]. Allied to this is the identifica-\ntion of a putative Nucleolysin TIAR protein, which is a\ncytotoxic granule associated RNA binding protein\ninvolved in targeting apoptosis. The significant presence\nof both genes indicates that the pair may act in tandem\nduring skeletal restructuring. All of these genes need to bePage 9 of 19\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Genomics 2009, 10:328 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/10\/328regulated and clues to the mechanism may be found in\nthe identification of an EST with sequence similarity to a\njuvenile hormone inducible protein (of unknown func-\ntion) (accession number: B0WJH4). Juvenile hormone is\nknown as a pleiotropic master hormone and along with\n20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) governs most aspects of insect\ninteraction with the ecosystem, affecting decisive life his-\ntory parameters such as growth, development and repro-\nduction [62,63]. Finally, there are two clones: clone\nsb_009_06O13 which shows sequence similarity (3.5 e-\n19) to the seven-in-absentia homologue (SIAH) from Dro-\nsophila melanogaster and a weak, but consistent match to\nthe winged helix\/forkhead transcription factor. The SIAH\ngene is highly conserved between Drosophila and mouse\n[64], but from the M. arctica and Drosophila alignment,\nthis is clearly not the case and therefore the EST cannot be\ndesignated a putative SIAH orthologue. However, SIAH\ndoes contain a zinc finger domain and therefore this EST\nhas been putatively designated as a zinc finger protein, the\nmembers of which interact with many transcription fac-\ntors and regulatory proteins. As regards the weak match to\nthe winged helix\/forkhead transcription factor, whether\nthis is an orthologue is difficult to determine, as this gene\nis not highly conserved between species (approximately\n30%, data not shown), but the match may indicate a puta-\ntive transcription factor along similar lines to SIAH dis-\ncussed previously.\nThis type of analysis clearly identifies a number of candi-\ndate sequences of both putatively assigned and unknown\nfunction for future investigations in the Arctic springtail.\nAlthough the identified clones co-regulate with TPS, they\nmay not be directly relevant to TPS metabolism and so\nfurther analyses of these sequences may have wider appli-\ncations to the study of dehydration processes, even in\nthose organisms that undergo anhydrobiosis in the\nabsence of trehalose accumulation.\nTrehalose and dehydration strategies\nA significant part of this paper has been concerned with\ntrehalose metabolism and associated gene expression\nanalyses. Indeed, there has been a significant amount of\nresearch into the role of disaccharides as cryoprotectants\nand trehalose in particular [65]. Accumulation of this\nmolecule has been shown to correlate with anhydrobiosis\nin a number of species (other than M. arctica) such as cysts\nof the brine shrimp Artemia franciscana [66], the larvae of\nthe chironomid midge Polypedilum vanderplanki [67], the\ntardigrade Adorybiotus coronifer [68] and several nematode\nspecies [69-72]. However, there are also a number of\nexamples where species undergo anhydrobiosis in the\nabsence of disaccharide accumulation including bdelloid\nrotifers [48,73] and some tardigrades [74]. Also the model\nspecies of bakers yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the\nnematode C. elegans accumulate trehalose in response to\nstressful conditions, but knockout experiments using TPS\ngenes has shown very little, if any effect [46,75]. This con-\nflicting data suggests that trehalose may not be the single\nmost important molecule in determining whether an ani-\nmal survives dehydration, but is one of a series of mecha-\nnisms, several of which may act synergistically to improve\nsurvival [74]. This emphasises the need to conduct large-\nscale gene expression experiments on these organisms to\nuncover the complexity of such interactions. In those\norganisms where sequence data is limiting, relatively sim-\nple statistical correlations, such as the heat map results\npresented here can provide valuable clues for further anal-\nyses. Where draft genome data or large-scale transcrip-\ntomic datasets exist, then more complex cellular gene\nnetwork analyses are possible [76].\nCandidate gene approach using Q-PCR analyses\nHaving just described the advantages of developing a net-\nwork approach to expression analyses, in non-model spe-\ncies, there is still added value in the candidate gene\napproach. This is particularly true where candidate genes\nhave been investigated in other species and have been\nshown to have significant effect on the process under\ninvestigation (c.f. small heat shock proteins and desicca-\ntion tolerance [77]). Because the Arctic springtail experi-\nments do not incorporate a time course experiment, it is\nperhaps not surprising that none of the obvious candi-\ndates such as the heat shock protein, HSP70 and the\naquaporins, are featured in the bioinformatics analyses\ndetailed above. As part of the microarray validation 21\ndehydration candidate genes (based on literature\nsearches) were chosen for more detailed Q-PCR analysis.\nQ-PCR of candidate stress genes\nQ-PCR was performed on all treatments (Table 2). The\nfirst candidates were aquaporins, transmembrane pro-\nteins involved in solute transport [78]. Three aquaporin\ngenes have been identified in M. arctica [27] and these\nwere generally down regulated, except for AQPA during\nrecovery and 0.2 salt and AQPC during the preliminary\nstages of cold dehydration. It is not known which solutes\nthese springtail aquaporins transport and so they may not\nbe the main cellular transporters or may act in concert\nwith other transmembrane proteins. Data from Poly-\npedilum vanderplanki indicates that of the two aquaporins\nisolated from this organism, one is involved in anhydro-\nbiosis, whilst the other controls water homeostasis of the\nfat body during normal conditions [79]. So the three\nspringtail genes could be activated under very different\nconditions or developmental stages. The TPS heat map\nresults (detailed above) did identify a member of the sol-\nute carrier family 13, which has been proposed to act in\ntandem with aquaporins. Studies using immunoblotting\nwith human AQP antibodies in the goldenrod gall fly\n(Eurosta solidaginis) [80] showed a similar complex pic-\nture, with upregulation of AQP3 and down regulation of\nAQP2 and AQP4 associated with dehydration.

The up-regulation of the\nsmall HSP is also shown in the genes most highly up-reg-\nulated in the -2\u00b0C treatment. Although HSP70 is classi-\ncally up-regulated in response to stress [81], this is only\none of a whole family of stress-associated proteins and it\nmay be that the expression levels of this particular mem-\nber is relatively unaffected under these circumstances.\nIndeed multiple members of the inducible HSP70 family\nwith differing expression patterns have been previously\nidentified in Antarctic invertebrates [82].\nAntioxidants are one of the main candidate groups pro-\nposed to be active during stressful physiological events. Of\nthe three genes tested, glutathione-s-transferase is clearly\nthe major gene involved in both dehydration and recov-\nery, whilst catalase showed some up-regulation under ini-\ntial cold dehydration. Allied to this, with oxidoreductase\nactivity, was the almost universal up-regulation of ferritin\n(which was also identified in the heat map analysis using\nTPS). Not surprisingly desaturase, which is involved in\nmembrane composition, was up-regulated in most condi-\ntions.\nFinally a series of candidate genes were chosen based on\ntheir GO (Molecular Function and Biological Process)\nassociation with trehalose metabolism [27]. This list\nmainly comprised TPS, trehalase and a number of puta-\ntive signalling molecules (protein kinases). Both TPS and\ntrehalase genes show up-regulation under all conditions.\nTrehalose is important as a cryoprotectant and such a pat-\ntern of gene expression is presumably indicative of an\nequilibrium reaction state, with trehalose being continu-\nally produced and broken down. What expression levels\ndo not show is how these translate into the protein pro-\nduction of these enzymes, the relative stabilities of the dif-\nferent messages or indeed the cellular requirements for\ntrehalose in terms of timescale related to the dehydration\nand rehydration processes. As could be predicted, the two\nTPS genes show different levels of expression due to their\nretention via sub-functionalisation [49]. As regards the\nprotein kinases, these tend to be up-regulated with recov-\nery, but this may simply be a factor of timescales, with\nrecovery happening over 18 hours, when signalling events\nwould be more apparent than after the days and weeks it\ntook to produce the different dehydration states. How-\never, the fact that most of these genes did change their\nexpression levels under at least one of the treatments, val-\nidates the use of Gene Ontology for identifying candidate\ngenes under broad headings such as trehalose metabo-\nlism, rather than only studying very specific segments of a\nbiochemical pathway, which require previous knowledge\nof the system. There are some differences between the\nabsolute gene expression levels of the cold and salt dehy-\ndrated animals. However, as stated earlier, this could be\ndue to different experimental conditions and variances of\nbiological replication. The differences are not so large as\nto be able to differentiate between the stresses involved in\ncold and salt dehydration, but such minor differences\npoint to candidate genes for further analyses during a time\ncourse experiment.\nTwo further obvious candidates for Q-PCR analyses are\nLEA proteins (c.f. [22]) and, because cold is involved, anti-\nfreeze proteins. Although antifreeze proteins have been\nidentified in other insects [83], some of which have been\nshown to be very potent [84], a comprehensive analysis of\nour EST dataset revealed no significant matches to known\nantifreeze protein genes (data not shown). Hence it is pre-\nsumed that antifreeze proteins do not play a role in cry-\nportoective dehydration in the M. arctica. As regards LEA\nproteins, a group 3 LEA protein has been fully character-\nised in M. arctica and correlated with the drought response\n[85]. This data was published just after our paper had\nbeen submitted. Of the M. arctica EST clones identified as\nbeing part of the group 3 LEA gene, only one\n(sb_009_02E03) was present on our microarray. Unfortu-\nnately the hybridization results of this clone were not\nentered into the global microarray analysis because of\nquality control issues and therefore it was not possible to\ncorrelate the M. arctica microarray expression results with\npublished results.\nPutative protein kinase DC2 +1.18 -1.08 -1.30 -1.13 +1.35\nSimilar to serine\/threonine protein kinase 6 (Aurora family kinase 1) -3.59 -1.89 -2.68 +1.13 +2.75\nProtein kinase C +1.08 -1.51 -2.58 -1.07 +1.43\ncAMP dependant protein kinase C1 -3.19 -4.23 -2.01 +1.18 +1.46\nThe actual change in gene expression is given as calculated via REST [106].\nTable 2: Q-PCR results showing expression changes in 21 genes under cold and salt dehydration conditions plus 18 hours recovery \ncompared to a control sequence.

The most closely\nrelated studies are those on insect desiccation stress and\ndrought acclimation, but clearly the mechanisms between\nthese survival tactics may differ and molecular analyses\nare very limited. Biochemical studies have so far shown\ntwo universal reactions to desiccation stress:\n\u2022 Production of cryoprotectants e.g. trehalose and\nglycerol [12,13,18,74].\n\u2022 Changes in membrane composition [13,18,86].\nThe two processes are linked, as removal of water pro-\nfoundly affects the physical properties of membrane\nphospholipids and leads to destructive events such as\nfusion, phase transitions and increased permeability. The\nsugar-based cryoprotectants prevent damage from dehy-\ndration by inhibiting fusion between adjacent vesicles\nduring desiccation and also by maintaining the lipids in a\nfluid state in the absence of water [87]. This protective\nprocess is substantiated in M. arctica by elevations in the\nexpression levels of the desaturase gene and TPS (also\nreflected in biochemical studies [12]).\nAt the gene level, dehydration-induced expression of LEA\nproteins has been demonstrated in a chironomid midge\n(Polypedilum vanderplanki) [22] and differential regulation\nof HSPs in a flesh fly (Sarcophaga crassipalpis) [19] and a\nmidge (Belgica antarctica) [17]. The latter two studies indi-\ncate the importance of not generalising results from a sin-\ngle species, as HSP23 and HSP70 are up-regulated in\nresponse to desiccation stress in the flesh fly pupae [19],\nwhilst neither are up-regulated in the Antarctic midge\n[17]. Experiments on rehydration using the flesh fly pupae\nshowed up-regulation of different HSPs compared with\ndesiccation, via family members; HSP90 and the constitu-\ntive form of HSP70 (HSC70). M. arctica presents a differ-\nent profile again with only the small HSP up-regulated in\nresponse to both desiccation and rehydration. However,\nthe work on the Antarctic midge also measured osmolar-\nity and showed no overall gain or loss of metabolites dur-\ning desiccation, suggesting that osmolytes may have been\nredistributed from the haemolymph to intracellular com-\npartments [17]. This is reflected in our studies by the\naltered expression of membrane-associated genes\ninvolved in solute and ion transport (c.f. aquaporins, a\nmember of the cation transport ATPase family, caltexin\n(buffering intracellular Ca2+), a putative Na+\/citrate co-\ntransporter, SEC14 (catalysing the exchange of phosphol-\nipids between membranes) and a trehalose transporter.\nTrehalose 6 phosphate synthase (2) sb_006_06G01 F: GGATGGAATTACTGGAGCTTGG\nR: GTGCTTGATGAGCTGTGAAACC\n0.985 110\nLATS tumour supressor sb_006_04E02 F: CGGGACGGACATATCAAACT\nR: TGAGCAAGGCATCGTACATT\n0.995 97\nSerine\/threonine protein kinase 38 sb_006_04N08 F: GACTGGTGGAGTCTGGGAGT\nR: CAGTCCACGCTTTTGAAGAA\n0.992 122\nProtein kinase A cAMP dependant catalytic sub-unit sb_006_07A12 F: TCAAAGGTCGAACCTGGACT\nR: AACCGTACTTTCCCTGCAAC\n0.990 100\nTrehalase precursor sb_006_01B14 F: CCGTAGATGGACTTCCTGGT\nR: TGCCTGTCAGAACACACAAA\n0.985 117\nP70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase sb_006_01P13 F: GGGCGAGATGCTAATGAAAT\nR: CCTTCGTGTGAGCAGTGTCT\n0.991 115\nPutative protein kinase DC2 sb_006_05C18 F: ATGGAGAATGGCACTGAGGAC\nR: CTTAGGCGTCTTTGGTAAACATCC\n0.995 99\nSimilar: serine\/threonine protein kinase 6 \n(Aurora family kinase 1)\nsb_006_07A19 F: ACTTTGACATTGGGCGTCTC\nR: CACCAGGGGCATATTCAAGA\n0.934 180\nProtein kinase C sb_008_03M09 F: ACTCCACGATGATGTGTTGTATCC\nR: TCCAGAACCACTTCCTTGATTGC\n0.995 80\ncAMP dependant protein kinase C1 sb_009_02D08 F: CAACGTCATCTACCGTGACC\nR: AAATACTCCGGTGTCCCACA\n0.988 102\nTable 3: Q-PCR primers with RSq and efficiency values (Continued)Page 14 of 19\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Genomics 2009, 10:328 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/10\/328Finally links can be made with the different approaches\ntaken to examine constant and fluctuating cold temperatures\nin a parasitic wasp (Aphidus colemani) [88,89] and rapid cold\nhardening in the flesh fly (S. crassipalpis) [18]. In the first\nstudy, proteomics was used and of particular note was the\nup-regulation of arginine kinase as a means of energy pro-\nduction during recovery and TCP-1 (a sub-unit of chaper-\nonin CCT) and a chitin binding protein during constant cold\ntemperatures [88]. There was also a clear involvement of the\nprotein-folding machinery and cytoskeletal rearrangement\nduring both processes. Our studies show similar results with\nup-regulation of arginine kinase during the recovery treat-\nment and continual involvement of cytoskeletal associated\nproteins during all treatments. The identification of enzymes\ninvolved in amino acid metabolism (cysteine dioxygenase\nand glutamate semialdehyde dehydrogenase) during the\nheat map analysis in M. arctica correlates with findings from\nmetabolomics studies showing alterations in the free amino\nacid pool associated with stress treatment and recovery\n[18,89]. Glutamine regulation is of particular note as it is\nassociated with both TPS expression (M. arctica) and rapid\ncold hardening (S. crassipalpis) [18]. This amino acid has\nbeen shown to not only contribute to osmolarity regulation,\nbut also to potentially increase the responsiveness of heat\nshock proteins [90] and suppress apoptosis [91]. It has also\npreviously been shown to accumulate in a number of other\ninsect species in response to cold temperatures and diapause\n[92-95].\nSo, although molecular analyses in other species are lim-\nited and may not represent the same physiological mech-\nanism, there are obvious similarities in response that can\nbe drawn from a number of different types of analyses\n(including biochemical, proteomic and metabolomic).\nThese, together with the data presented here are gradually\nincreasing our knowledge on how insects successfully sur-\nvive dehydration events.\nConclusion\nMicroarray analysis has produced a greater understanding\nof the processes and genes underlying the process of cryo-\nprotective dehydration. Namely production and mobili-\nsation of trehalose, protection of cellular systems via\nsmall heat shock proteins and tissue\/cellular remodelling\nduring the desiccation process. Energy production, initia-\ntion of protein translation and cell division, plus potential\ntissue repair processes dominate genes identified during\nrecovery. Q-PCR on selected candidate genes has also con-\ntributed to our understanding, with glutathione-S-trans-\nferase identified as the major antioxdidant enzyme\nprotecting the cells during these stressful procedures and\na number of protein kinase signalling molecules involved\nin recovery. Desaturase, a gene associated with changes in\nmembrane composition also showed changes in expres-\nsion levels with treatment. Heat map analysis of genes co-\nregulated with trehalose-6-phosphate synthase was partic-\nularly useful in identifying a number of candidate clones\nwith sequence similarity to membrane proteins and sig-\nnalling molecules, which will be targeted in future, more\nfunctionally based, analyses.\nMethods\nSample collection and preparation\nM. arctica, were collected under the bird cliffs at Stuphallet and\nKrykkefjellet on the Br\u00f8ggerhalv\u00f8ya, near Ny \u00c5lesund, Spits-\nbergen, Svalbard, Norway (78\u00b056'N, 11\u00b053'E) and trans-\nported to the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), Cambridge, for\nanalysis. Animals (mixture of both adult and juveniles) were\ncultured in ventilated plastic boxes containing moss, lichen\nand soil taken from field sites and fed on dried baker's yeast.\nCultures were kept moist at +4\u00b0C.\nMicroarray construction and hybridization\nThe 13,824 feature microarray was constructed by print-\ning 6912 PCR-amplified cDNA clones in duplicate. These\nwere derived from a previous EST study [26] and com-\nprised 3840 clones from the Library D2 (fully dehydrated\nanimals, cooled to -14\u00b0C) and 3072 clones from the\nLibrary D1 (dehydrating animals cooled to -2\u00b0C). The\nStratagene SpotReport Alien Array Validation System\n(Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) was included on the micro-\narray. Construction and hybridization of the arrays were\nperformed as previously described [96] with the exception\nof the amino-modified primers used for the initial cDNA\namplification for array printing, which in this study were:\n(pAL32FOR: TTCTCGGGAAGCGCG and M13 forward:\nGTAAAACGACGGCCAG). Hybridizations were per-\nformed using control animals in combination with the\ngroups listed below.\nFive groups of animals were used for the hybridizations.\nTreatments were as follows:\n\u2022 C = control = live animals from +5\u00b0C\n\u2022 -2\u00b0C = cold dehydrated animals, cooled from +4\u00b0C\nto -2\u00b0C at a rate of 2\u00b0C\/week and held at -2\u00b0C for 7\ndays. Animals were kept in sealed tubs on moist plas-\nter of Paris. Ice chips were added to the tubs once the\ntemperature reached below 0\u00b0C. Final water content\nof the animals was approximately 1.1 \u00b1 0.2 g\/g dry\nweight.\n\u2022 -7\u00b0C = cold dehydrated animals, protocol as above,\nbut cooled to -7\u00b0C. Final water content of the animals\nwas approximately 0.57 \u00b1 0.2 g\/g dry weight.\n\u2022 H18 = animals taken from -7\u00b0C, and left to recover\nfor 18 hours at +5\u00b0C with moisture.\n\u2022 0.9 salt = salt dehydrated = animals were slowly dehy-\ndrated over a saturated solution of potassium nitratePage 15 of 19\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Genomics 2009, 10:328 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/10\/328(which gives a constant humidity of 96% RH at +5\u00b0C) to\nproduce animals with a water content og 0.9 \u00b1 0.12 g\/g\ndry weight i.e. slightly less than the -2\u00b0C animals.\n\u2022 0.2 salt = salt dehydrated = animals were dehydrated\nas above to produce animals with a water content og\n0.2 \u00b1 0.07 g\/g dry weight i.e. slightly less than the -7\u00b0C\nanimals.\n6 biological replicates and technical replicates in the form\nof dye swops were performed for each condition.\nMicroarray data analysis\nThe microarray images were analysed using the GenePix\n6.0 software (Molecular Devices). After gridding and seg-\nmentation, visual inspection was used to flag and exclude\nanomalous spots. The R [97] Limma package [98-100]\nwas used for analysis. Background Subtraction was\napplied using the normexp function with an offset of 50\n[101], within array normalisation through print-tip loess\n[102] and normalisation between arrays with Rquantile.\nDifferentially expressed clones were selected at FDR\nadjusted p-value [103] of 0.01 and a B statistic (log-odds)\nof 4.5, giving a 99% probability of differential expression.\nAnnotation and gene ontology mapping of the clones was\ncarried out as described in [27]. GO enrichment was deter-\nmined by a proportion test, at a FDR adjusted p-value of\n0.01, between the number of clones representing a GO\nterm on the chip compared to the number of differentially\nexpressed clones representing the same GO term in a\ngiven list. The array design is housed at ArrayExpress,\naccession number: A-MEXP-1540, and the experiments: E-\nMEXP-2105. All clones on the array are taken from a sub-\nset of the EST data set analysed in [27] (accession num-\nbers: dbEST: 49109381\u201349125759, Genbank:\nEW744731\u2013EW761109). From a complete cross correla-\ntion matrix, 53 clones having 98% correlation or more\nwith the 3 trehalose clones (sb_006_04P17,\nsb_009_07N11, sb_006_06G01) were pulled out and the\nlog fold changes of the treatments were used to construct\na heat map using hierarchical clustering with Euclidean\ndistance measure and Average linkage (UPGMA) [104]. A\nsimilar approach was used to cluster all the post-analysis\ndata to construct the dendrogram in Figure 3.\nIsocitrate lyase PCR\nA primer pair was chosen to span approximately 800 bp\nof the EST contig.

PCR conditions for both genomic DNA and cDNA\n(produced from -2\u00b0C cold dehydrated animals): 95\u00b0C 10\nmins, 35 cycles of 95\u00b0C 30 secs, 62\u00b0C 30 secs, 72\u00b0C 3\nmins, final extension of 72\u00b0C 10 mins using standard\nPCR mix (BioTaq from Bioline) with 15 mM MgCl2.\nQ-PCR\nTo validate the microarray results, 21 clones were chosen\nfor Q-PCR analysis (Table 3). The RSq and efficiency val-\nues were calculated for each primer set (Table 3). All genes\nwere amplified using specific primers, Brilliant SYBR\u00ae\nGreen QPCR Master Mix (Stratagene) and an MX3000P\nQ-PCR machine (Stratagene). PCR conditions were as fol-\nlows: 95\u00b0C 10 minutes, 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C 30 seconds,\n60\u00b0C 1 minute and 72\u00b0C for 45 seconds with a final dis-\nsociation curve step as per manufacturer's recommenda-\ntions. The plate set-up for each Q-PCR experiment\nconsisted of the 5 animal treatments (including controls)\namplified in triplicate (technical replicates) with the clone\nsb_009_01G07 used as a control sequence. This clone had\nbeen previously identified in the preliminary microarray\nanalyses as invariant between all treatments and showed\nno sequence similarity to any characterized gene in the\npublic databases. Primers were validated and the results\nanalysed as described in [82] using the methods of\n[105,106], which incorporates the efficiency of the prim-\ners as a factor in the equation. The Q-PCR analyses were\nall carried out on freshly isolated RNA and cDNA, hence\nrepresenting different biological replicates compared to\nthe RNAs used for the microarrays.\nAuthors' contributions\nMC was a BAS Co-PI on the external funding, drafted the\nmanuscript and lead the analyses.
