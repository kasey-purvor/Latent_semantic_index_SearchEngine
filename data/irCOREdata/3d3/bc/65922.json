Their interest was serious, sustained if discontinuous.

Examination of their \nderstanding and representations of the British model of labor relations aids our \npreciation of the ideological framework within which they conceived and constructed the \nerican Way.  \nrough three generat\nparent resolution aft\nq\nlutions to the labor problem often looked eastward toward Britain, the first industrial \ntion. U.S. perceptions of and reactions to the British model of labor relations through these \nubled years shed light on both the influence of other nations' example on U.S. social \nand the related question of the uniqueness or otherwise of the distinctive American \nodel of workers' self-organization and labor politics which emerged.1  \nThe period during which Americans were interested in Britain's developing industrial \nlations system as a model can be dated quite precisely.2  It began in the late 1860s, during \ne first post-Civil War peak in trade union activity.  As some Americans sought solutions to \nbor unrest, they discovered that Britain had been down this rocky road before and had\n to smooth it out.  A Royal Commission on Trade Unions sat in Britain from \noring the place of unions within industry and before the law.  Its findings were \nell publicized, as was the example of successful local boards of arbitration between \nployers and labor in a growing number of comparatively well-organized trades.  The \nssons of British experience were relayed to Americans through the labor press and via a \n re.  After the 1877 crisis, Congress appointed a committee, under the Democrats\u2019 \ny leader, Abram Hewitt of New York, to look into the labor problem in the \nnited States.  A large-scale entrepreneur in the coal, iron, and steel industries, Hewitt was a \nrsonal incarnation of the transatlantic industrial revolution-- his father was a member of the \necting crew of English mechanics who arrived in 1794 with the first steam-engine in \n2\nstudy\nco\nad\nca\nar\nst\nCo\nas the a\nbo\nre\nth  their work, \u201cthe more \nharmoniou\nha\nthe\nco\ntur\nas\nre\nA\nm\nof \nin\nco\nrai\nG\nAg nal) to England to study how labor troubles were \nhandled the 5\nHouse majorit\nU\npe\ner\n-and-lecture trip in 1870 by two Liberal MPs, friends of labor and apostles of \nnciliation.  Thomas Hughes was a Christian socialist, pioneer of workers\u2019 education, and \nvocate of the cooperative movement; Anthony Mundella a lifelong radical and self-made \nptain of industry, a progressive employer who had established the first successful board of \nbitration in England.  Both were in the forefront of the campaign to establish a secure legal \natus for British trades unions, Hughes as a member of the pro-labor minority on the Royal \nmmission.  They had name recognition and some credibility in the United States -- Brown \nuthor of Tom Brown\u2019s Schooldays (1857), a best-seller on both sides of the Atlantic; \nth of them thanks to their ardent advocacy of the Union cause during the Civil War and the \nstoration of good Anglo-American relations thereafter.3 \nAccording to Clifton Yearley, there were two central themes in their message: first, \nat \u2018the more successfully unions were organized and able to carry on\ns their relations\u201d with employers, the less likely it became that anyone would start \nsty, violent, or unlawful action.\u2019 British unions therefore \u2018won a vote of confidence from \n nation at large and many in the governing class.\u2019  These strong and secure unions became \nnservative, and were thus excellent models for their fledgling American brethren in the \nbulent post-Civil War years.  Second, those unions and the employers they dealt with, \nsisted by members of the local bourgeoisie, had found a route to social peace via union \ncognition and the development of voluntaristic, non-conflictual dispute settlement systems.  \nmerican unions aspiring to the same status as their British brethren and operating in a far \nore hostile environment, or middle-class Americans concerned about the resulting problem \nlabor conflict, could adopt the same techniques.  As the Chicago Daily News commented \n 1874, \u2018Great Britain has proved the truth of the theory [of arbitration].  America can \nnfidently and easily adopt it.\u20194 \nBetween the Molly Maguires troubles in the Anthracite District, and the great national \nlroad strike of 1877, developments which made the labor problem far more urgent, \novernor Hartranft of Pennsylvania in 1876 sent Joseph Weeks, associate editor of the Iron \ne (the heavy industries' main trade jour\n 3\nAm\nhe\nte\nun\nbu\nde\nfr\nwhi\nin\nfo\nha h better in the Old Country, and that America should import Victorian Britain's \nmethods of\nun\nfoo\nY\nref\nerica, imported from their employers, Boulton & Watt of Birmingham; he stayed on to \nlp build the first American-made engines.  In 1867, while travelling in Europe, Hewitt had \nstified to the British Royal Commission, where he emphasized that \u2018between the trades\u2019 \nions of Great Britain and those in the United States there is undoubtedly a strong analogy \nt \u2026 your organizations are more perfect than ours, and have arrived at a more complete \nvelopment.\u20196  He supported the Hughes-Mundella tour \u2013 both of them were personal \niends of his -- the high point of which was an all-ticket public lecture at Cooper Union \nch Hewitt\u2019s father-in-law Peter Cooper funded, and at which \u2018the respectability and \ntelligence of New York\u2019 including \u2018a large audience of working men\u2019 were present in \nrce.7   \nWeeks and Hewitt reached the same, predictable conclusions: that these matters were \nndled muc\n conciliation and arbitration in industrial disputes, together with the responsible \nionism on which they depended.8  In offering this advice, they followed closely in the \ntsteps of one of the first comprehensive studies of the labor problem, authored by Edward \noung, chair of the U.S. Bureau of Statistics, whose Labor in Europe and America (1875) \nerred to trade unions only in the sections dealing with ancient Rome and contemporary \nritain.B\nw\nre\nth\nfa\nmi superiority of their \nsy ither to give it their \nbacking or \nen\ndi\nan\nTh\npe\n9  Young, Weeks, and Hewitt thereby established a tradition in the mid-1870s which \nould last for decades, of speaking and writing as if Britain's experience was directly \nlevant to the United States, and indeed as if it was almost the only experience relevant to \ne United States as it confronted its own labor problem.  \nThe end of this period of serious interest, sometimes bordering on admiring \nscination, can be dated with only slightly less precision than its start. Before World War I, \nddle-class Americans do not seem to have been very sure about the \nstem of industrial relations, but by the early 1920s they were ready e\nto stop caring.  A few labor activists and progressive intellectuals remained \nthusiastic for the British model of industrial relations, and it even gained support from a \nfferent quarter and for different reasons in the 1930s; but these views had little resonance \nd, crucially, no longer any policy significance.10 \n* * * \ne depression of the 1870s and the aftermath of World War I thus bracket a distinctive \nriod when American discourse about labor moved beyond old assumptions that the United \n 4\nSta\nra\nw\nA\nw\nth\nex\nperce\nart\n \n1. The Day of the Saxon12: Reformers and the Labor Problem  \nIn 1913 the labor economist and historian Henry Hoagland, in an article subtitled \u2018A Study in \nAm ence \nof his emerging field on British inspiration, its lack of confidence in American institutions: \ntha\nin f\nHoagland's\nindependen\ncommonpla unionism was simply British trades unionism, \nwrit late an\nacts -- namely, that American laborers have looked to the English \nunions for leadership -- is hardly justified.  Instead, American unions...have followed \nthei\ntes was like other industrializing societies and could learn from them toward a view \npidly consolidated by the early twenties, that there was a distinctive American Way to \nhich the experiences of other nations could contribute nothing useful. As my title suggests, \nmericans began by anticipating the convergence theories of the 1960s to conclude that \nhere industrial Britain had led, America should follow, down a common path determined by \ne irresistible forces of industrialism.  But Americans arrived in the 1920s with \nceptionalism fully installed as ideology and practice.  Charting and explaining changing \nptions of the British model through this half-century, and their impact, is the rest of this \nicle\u2019s purpose.11 \nerican Trade Unionism\u2019 (emphasis added), complained about the intellectual depend\nThe undergraduate student of economics who knows anything at all of the history of \nmodern labor organizations generally receives his knowledge from reading the epoch-\nmaking work by Sydney (sic) and Beatrice Webb....[T]he student is led to conclude \nt modern trade unions were first developed in England and were later transplanted \null bloom to American soil. \n purpose was to explain that the American labor movement had its own \nt history, with roots decades old.  But first he felt he had to fend off the \nce assumption that American trades \nd small: \nOf course it is true that the labor organizations of this country have not always kept \npace with those of England.... It is also true that at times the English unions have been \na decade or more in advance of the American.  But the conclusion which is so often \ndrawn from these f\nr own line of development.13 \n 5\nThe British share of the labor force and the migration stream fell, and the AFL \ntablished itself under a leadership increasingly convinced that American conditions \nquired a uniquely American response.\nHo\nw\nof \npa\nan\nso\nits\n\u2018toget\nw\nam\nra impressed by America\u2019s \nimmense in\nEd\nwo\nas\nex\nas\npo\nea\nB\nYearley has argued quite convincingly that British influence on American unions declined by \nthe 1890s. \nes\nre\nof\nm\nan\ninnovation\nG\nem\nagland's conclusions are unexceptionable nowadays, but at the time his exceptionalism \nas still quite unusual, even among his colleagues.  American respect for the British model \nlabor relations can be explained in two ways -- institutional and intellectual.  Americans, \nrticularly those of British origin, looked to British experience as both the best-developed \nd the most comparable example for them to study and appropriate, the achievement of a \nciety and culture with which they were closely connected.  There was a natural kinship; as \n president, Henry Towne, told the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in 1889, \nher we constitute the two branches of the great Anglo-Saxon, English-speaking race, \nhich, in accomplishment, especially in the industrial world, is at present easily the leader \nong the nations in the march of civilization.\u201914 \nBy the end of the nineteenth century, the novice was overtaking the old hand in the \nce for economic growth. British observers became increasingly \ndustrial power and the growing productivity advantage it depended upon.  In the \nwardian period the United States enjoyed a clear lead, and British commentators began to \nrry about their relative decline. But the differences between Britain and the United States \n industrializing nations still did not seem large enough to persuade Americans that Britain's \nperience was irrelevant. Through the Progressive Era, Britain's was not generally perceived \n a failed industrial economy; even if its economic performance compared increasingly \norly with America's; it was still worthy of study and selective emulation.15 \nBritain was singularly important as a model for American labor, particularly in the \nrly decades of craft unionism.  American labor activists did not have to read about the \nritish labor movement in order to learn from it; many had direct, personal experience.16  \n17  But this did not weaken the enthusiasm of sections \n the concerned American middle class, including thoughtful employers, for the British \nodel as they understood it, which acquired a life of its own.  Joseph Weeks, Abram Hewitt, \nd others continued sermonizing about their perception of mid-Victorian Britain's \ns in the management of industrial conflict through and after American labor\u2019s \nreat Upheaval of the mid-1880s, and found a receptive audience, if not among their \nployees, then at least among their bourgeois brethren.18 \n 6\nWhe\nAmericans\nan\nfo\nas\npa\nth\nasso\nU\ndir\nC\nop\nto\nco\nap l Civic Federation \n(NCF)'s conference in December 1900, \nThi\nhe country of its origin, England, may well \nbe \ncons\ncon\neco\nInd\nThese new\norganic, pu\nprecedent s\ndisciplined ng path toward civic \nintegration.   \nw\nn the Pullman Strike sharpened anxieties about the labor problem, middle-class \n interest in the British experience grew.  Mundella-style arbitration in the 1860s \nd 1870s used impartial intervention from local elites (who acted as 'umpires' -- the name \nr the referee in some sports acquiring popularity and formal organization at the same time \n British employers and workers were also learning the \u2018rules of the game\u2019) to assist the \nrties to resolve their disputes, or even to reach decisions where they could not agree among \nemselves.  But by the 1890s that model was often replaced by direct discussions between \nciated employers and union leaders.  The Webbs called this \u2018collective bargaining.\u2019 \nmpires might still have a role in the resulting relationships, but mutual recognition by and \nect contact between the parties was key.  Carroll Wright, Joseph Weeks, economist Henry \narter Adams, and in due course Marcus Hanna, amongst others, tried to lead informed \ninion in the 1890s toward an understanding of what was required for this voluntarist road \n social peace to work in America too: in Weeks's words, \u2018you cannot have arbitration and \nnciliation unless you have on each side a strong union.\u2019 19 \nThis was the new lesson reformers took from the British experience and attempted to \nply to America. As Commons commented, in his report on the Nationa\ns higher form of industrial peace \u2013 negotiation -- has now reached a formal stage \nin a half dozen large industries in the United States, which, owing to its remarkable \nlikeness to parliamentary government in t\ncalled constitutional government in industry....This remarkable form of \ntitutional government is not the creation of any single intellect, nor of any \nstitutional convention.

Impressed by the forces of industrialism and what we would call 'modernization,' \nucated Americans believed that these were forcing a fundamental convergence in different \ncieties.  As Joseph Weeks put it in 1895, \u2018The primary problems of civilization are material \nes; their answers are writ in fire.\u201922  Industrialization was a process dominated, at the time, \n the three nations thought to share a common 'Teutonic' heritage in the racial Anglo-\nxonism of the mid- to late nineteenth century.  Transformations in the meaning of Ango-\nxonism, away from romantic racialism and toward an interpretation emphasizing a shared \nory, language, and political tradition, further accentuated Americans tendency to \ninimize or ignore the institutional and cultural barriers to policy borrowing from Great \nitain that an exceptionalist analysis would emphasize.23   \nThe late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries also marked the\nmericans' respectful familiarity with this Anglo-American common culture.  \nanks to the influence of American Historical Association policy on the high-school \nrriculum after 1889, more Americans studied British history in depth as the foundation for \nir own history in the early twentieth century than ever before or since.24  And that shared \nst shaped how Americans understood the British model of labor relations, and its American \nunterparts.  Commons could write about the Interstate Conference between bituminous coal \nerators and miners as being like a medieval parliament of Lords and (sic) Commons, \nhtly assuming that most of his readers could understand, indeed visualize, his simile.  \nenty years later his student William Leiserson required an even better knowledge of a \nrsion of the common past \u2013 though not his past -- when he explained that the steel \npanies' employment of unskilled workers to break skilled workers' strikes was \u2018but \npetition of the Tudor Kings of England using the common people against the nobles to re-\ntablish absolute monarchy.\u2019  One of the attractive features of this Whiggish version of \nstory to American labor reformers like Commons or Leiserson was its doctrine of inevitable \nogress toward democracy. When Commons spoke about the 'constitutionalizing' of industry \nrough the wider application of the trade agreement idea, his readers would have understood \nat he did not anticipate an American-model written constitution, but something more like \nritain's informal constitutional order, an accumulation of precedents \u2013 a common law of \nr.25 \n* * * \niddle-class Americans' understanding of the British model became fixed by the early 1900s.  \n rican labor problem, even after the failure of NCF-style voluntarism in 1901-2 and \ne launching of the Open Shop movement in 1903. Unions were stagnant at best, employers \n the offensive, conflict worsening.  Convergence was evidently not happening; instead, the \nxceptional\u2019 American system was taking shape . Committed to trade unionism and \nllective bargaining to bring a measure of \u2018democracy in industry,\u2019 American progressives \nced hostile American employers and judges. They still looked to the British example, at \nt as they understood it, for inspiration.  The prewar British reality of growing industrial \nrest would not have been as useful, so it was ignored. \n8\n18\nCo\nnu\nhi\nm\nre\nw\nem\nco\nor\nco\nco\nm\nm\nacquire \nbe\npe\nw\nvo\nal\npe d union growth and increasing militancy.

British trade unions \nere still larger, better established, and more stable than their American counterparts; British \nployers appeared more reconciled to union recognition than their American peers; British \nllective bargaining systems looked durable and effective, and had the prestige belonging to \nganic social invention in the era of \u2018evolutionary naturalism.\u2019  A viable alternative to \nmpulsory arbitration (an alternative panacea), British voluntarism was consistent with both \nuntries' anti-statist traditions.  Britain\u2019s comparatively peaceful strikes also contrasted ever \nore favorably with America's during the Age of Industrial Violence.27  And, finally, the \nost pressing questions of the 1900s and early 1910s for friends of labor -- How should labor \na political voice?

The war ushered in a final \nescendo of American progressive interest in British social experimentation along with great \nthat, if it would only learn from the British example, American society would be \nnsformed in the direction of industrial democracy by the rising power of organized labor.30   \nObviously that did not occur.  Instead, there was America's second, and apparently \noment of exceptionalism.  Instead of an advance into Reconstruction (a term \nrrying none of the negative freight in Britain that it did in the United States), there was a \ntreat into Normalcy; instead of a Labour Party and industrial democracy, Republican \ngemony and the American Plan.  The rest of this article will explain why and how the \nexperience contributed to this conservative outcome almost as much as a liberal \nading of Britain\u2019s labor relations model had inspired progressive hopes for something \nmpletely different. \n weakness of the previous section of this article -- a common\nocial policy -- is the implicit assumption that the ideas that\niented, reformist intellectuals.  But members of the American\nn sources of information about Britain, their own ideas about it and saw it as a model of an \ndesired future. And what they thought about the British model, and how it affected their \nhaviour, turned out to be far more important.   \nThe British and American employer communities had dense networks of \nmmunication, paralleling those of the transatlantic world of reform. Hewitt and Weeks, for \nple, presided over the American Institute of Mining En\n the (British) Iron and Steel Institute, whose secretary did\n 10\nme\nac\nbu\nov\nre\nA\nth\nWesti\nex\ncould look\nA\n-- \nm\nlead\npa\npr\npa\non\nA\nou\nro  arbitration: \u2018a new power has \nentered into the industrial world which must be recognized.  \u2026 [T]his power can not be \ndestroyed b\nde\naf\nintervals, in strikes and lock-outs, which have no redeeming feature...  [T]he interests \nof a\nmbership; business news and reports about new technologies traveled rapidly both ways \nross the Atlantic. The American Society of Mechanical Engineers could be more insular, \nt the trade journal that was its midwife, the American Machinist, circulated widely \nerseas \u2013 so much so that it established a separate British edition \u2013 informing its far-flung \nadership of developments in labor as well as in manufacturing and managerial methods. \nmerican managers and entrepreneurs had an interest in British realities, to keep abreast of \neir most important competitors and even to acquire British manufacturing subsidiaries. \nnghouse, for example, built a factory at Trafford Park, Manchester, and gained direct \nperience of the travails of working with a British labor force in a unionized environment.31 \nThis meant that, at critical moments of labor relations crisis American businessmen \n across the Atlantic and draw distinctly different lessons than did social reformers. \nt Kim Voss's moment when exceptionalism began -- the Great Upheaval of the mid-1880s \nWeeks's boss at The Iron Age, James Bayles, was distinctly less upbeat about the British \nodel than Weeks himself.  Bayles noted the tendency of 'responsible' British labor \nership -- an essential ingredient in making union recognition and collective bargaining \nlatable to employers -- to collapse in the face of the rank-and-file militancy.  Democratic \nocesses prevented these organizations from remaining remain disciplined bargaining \nrtners. Bayles concluded that it would be better to consult with employees, but only with \ne's own employees, in house. Anticipating the preferences of a subsequent generation of \nmerican employers, he recommended the \u2018shop council\u2019 as a unilateral alternative to \ntside labor organization, and representation32 \nEven Abram Hewitt was of two minds about the wisdom or necessity of the British \nad. On the one hand, union recognition, conciliation, and\ny force and violence unless society be destroyed with it.  It must be heard.  Its just \nmands must be heeded.  This is the voice of reason as well as of religion.\u201933  On the other, \nter the Molly Maguires, the Hewitt also preached a gospel of pre-emption, not concession:  \nTo insure continuous operations, the best relations must exist between the corporate \nowners and the laborers in their employ\u2026 [But] throughout the coal regions these \nrelations have been of the most unsatisfactory character, resulting, at often-recurring \nll classes concur in the prevention of these destructive and demoralizing \n 11\nTen y\nbu\nim f the conditions of employment to undercut the workers\u2019 own demand for \nunionism. \nw\nfo\nthe\nco\nal\npr\nan\nro\nco\nright \nco\nno\nob\ning the appearance of even-handedness, Hewitt\u2019s balance of rights \nclearly fav\nth\n him in any organization, \nand when a man declines to combine it is a violation of right to refuse to work with \nhim\nto b\nA b\ndec t.  The \nclai\noperation\ncollisions, and \u2026 the owners of the property, for their own self-protection, will be \ndriven to remove the causes which have produced them.34 \nears before Bayles, Hewitt thus anticipated another of the foundation ideas of American \nsiness's exceptionalism: industrial paternalism, or welfare capitalism, the unilateral \nprovement o\nHewitt fleshed out these contradictory messages over the next fourteen years.  Unions \nere as much a product of capitalist development as were corporations themselves: \u2018The \nrmation of such unions is alike a right and a duty; and so long as they confine themselves to \n assertion of the rights and the protection of the interests of their members they are to be \nmmended and encouraged.\u201935  But this rhetorical acceptance of trade unionism was, as \nways with American employers, wrapped around with qualifications that diminished it, in \nactice, to almost nothing.  The solution to the labor problem \u2018must be based upon justice\u2019; \nd justice must be built on a set of classic republican contractual principles, which left little \nom for actually-existing trade unionism.  Employers and workmen both had the right to \nmbine, but neither had the right to coerce the other; free-labor principles meant that \u2018the \nof workmen to refrain from labor and the right of the employer to cease to employ are \nrrelative rights; but no one has the right to compel any other workman to cease from labor, \nr has the employer any right to lock out his workmen in order to compel submission to \nnoxious rules.\u201936 \nWhile maintain\nored capital, because it alone assumed the risks of doing business, and because \nere were some offences that only labor could commit: \nNo man has the right to compel another man to combine with\n, and to deny him the means of earning a living.  It is equally wrong for employers \nlack-list men, so that others will not give them employment. \noycott cannot be defended under any circumstances whatever.  It is in effect a \nlaration of private war...to be stamped out by prompt and severe punishmen\nm of any body of men that under any circumstances they have the right to stop the \ns of business...cannot be tolerated.37 \n d productivity, only to be tolerated if hedged around with laws, and to be undermined by \nployers' conduct within their own establishments.  Employers should hold fast to the \niple that \u2018Each man should be paid wages according to the value of his labor, and not on \ne mistaken basis of a dead level of mediocrity, advocated and enforced by some trades-\nganization.  Progress is only possible where the individual is encouraged to develop his \nill and apply his labor, by a payment in proportion to the results achieved.\u2019  Beyond this, \ney should develop novel systems of reward -- profit sharing, and, best of all, employee \n12\nTh\nac\ntra\nem\nfu\non\n\u2018in\nabout ultim\nla\nel\nev\ncourts and \nbe\nlabo\nth\nof \nun\nge\nthe \nind\ngrad\npro\nand\nwh\nThus, to H , \nan\nem\nprinc\nth\nor\nsk\nth\nat should be plain enough: unions were acceptable in principle, provided they did not \ntually do those things on which their power depended.  Hewitt's vision was of a future with \nde unions -- but without strikes or collectively-imposed limitations on the freedom of \nployers or employees.  Hewitt's limited commitment to arbitration and conciliation was a \nnction of his hatred of industrial conflict, for which civilized substitutes must be found; \nce the latter \u2018competent tribunals\u2019 were in place, strikes and lock-outs would be \ndefensible.\u2019  Conciliation and arbitration were simply \u2018transitional means for bringing \nthe ate relations of peace and harmony which must exist between capital and \nbor.\u201938  Evidently, Hewitt imported the British model very selectively, choosing only those \nements that addressed his immediate concern -- conflict-reduction -- while overlooking \nerything else, notably the general acceptance by parliament, and to a lesser extent the \nemployers, of everyday trades union practices that he found intolerable. \nIndeed, Hewitt shared many negative stereotypes about British labor relations \ncoming commonplace among his peers.  Already in 1867, alongside plaudits to British \nr, he complained about \u2018strikes long continued and in all branches of business, reducing \ne workmen to beggary and destroying the profits of capital to such an extent that in a spirit \nself-preservation it takes flight where it can from the walks of industry and remains \nemployed rather than incur the risks and the anxieties of its uses in active business.\u201939  A \nneration later, he still accused British labor of undermining economic progress: \naction of the trade-unions has been exerted in the direction of obliterating the \nividual to such an extent that special skill is rapidly declining, and in the finer \nes of work it is almost impossible to find the experience required for the \nduction of instruments of precision.  This is a national evil of the first magnitude; \n its disastrous consequences are becoming apparent to the intelligent workman \nose opportunities to rise in life are thus abridged and destroyed.40 \newitt, trade unions were at best a necessary evil; enemies of individualism, order\n 13\npheaval in the mid-1880s, and many of the tactics they would use for decades in their anti-\nbor struggles were developed.  But the game was only just beginning.  The crucial time of \ncision for employers came later, during the short-lived Trade Agreement Era, as Jeffrey \nstoc\nin\nor hen every intelligent workman will insist upon being an \nowner, and\nin \nN\nbo\nun m of industrial relations which would do away with the necessity for \nthem altog\n[T]\nten\npro\nnew\nprin\nind\nA\nle\nIt h\nad\nHewitt \nBritish ins\npu\nm\nel\non\n* * * \nKim Voss's moment when American labor relations becam ptional is far too early.  \nAgreed, employers' anti-union predispositions were sharpened and clarified in that first Great \nU\nla\nde\nk-ownership, \u2018the stimulus of being engaged in a successful business and having a direct \nterest in its results.\u2019 The industrial millennium would not come from collective bargaining \nconciliation and arbitration, but \u2018w\n every well-managed corporation will see that its workmen are directly interested \nthe results of the business.\u201941 \nTwo years before Homestead, four before Pullman, a dozen before the failure of the \nCF and the Anthracite Coal Strike award, Hewitt had laid down the impossibly narrow \nundaries within which trades unions could be tolerated, and made clear his preference for a \nitary-corporatist syste\nether.   \nhe concentration of force under one management, in accordance with the modern \ndency to centralization, may be made to solve, and must necessarily solve, the \nblem of harmonizing capital and labor engaged in the work of production, without \n legislation or the application of any other than familiar and well-recognized \nciples of social organization....[T]he invasion of government into the domain of \nustry must be met with uncompromising opposition.42 \ns it would be, except where the exercise of the federal government's coercive power, \ngitimized by judicial innovation, aimed at repressing labor unions and strikes.43   \nas been useful to clarify what the leading, exceptionally articulate employer \nvocate of labor-management harmony, British-style, actually meant. Not surprisingly, \nwas far more American than British in his outlook; for him, selective borrowing of \ntitutions was secondary to the pursuit of industrial relations strategies whose \nrpose was altogether different.  Union recognition, conciliation, and arbitration were \neans, not ends; they were to contain industrial conflict until the occasions for it were \niminated.  Discarding Hewitt\u2019s equivocation, later American employers would implement \nly the latter part of his program. \ne exce\n f how much trouble and strife it would cost employers to win back a necessary \ninimum of workplace authority if they allowed unions to grow too strong in the first place? \ne rapid breakdown of the Murray Hill Agreement in 1901 backed the doubters\u2019 arguments. \n14\nHa\nin\nR\nco\nan\nwords, \u2018of t\nexperience\nst\nw\nor\nth\nan\npa\nna al systems of collective bargaining seemed, for a very short time, so \npr\nEm\nre\nem\nso\nev\nacc\nm\nex\nIn\nw\nth\nof \n British Engineers' experience?  \nInstead of demonstrating the promise of the trade agreement system, was it not instead dire \nevidence o\nm\nTh\nydu and David Brian Robertson, among others, have argued.  Between 1898 and 1903 \ndustrialists were faced with a serious challenge from dynamic AFL craft unions.  \nespectable and official opinion, represented in the NCF and through successive federal \nmmissions of the 1890s and early 1900s, still advocated the British model of conciliation \nd collective bargaining. Many American employers were, in the late Howard Gitelman's \nwo minds\u2019 confronting labor\u2019s challenge. Their own reading of the British \n with union power and labor conflict would help to resolve their choice.44 \nThe primary and secondary metal-processing and metal-working industries were the \norm-center during the Trade Agreement Era.  Iron and steel offered the first evidence that \nhile Hewitt's younger executive successors had little of his ambivalence toward labor \nganization, they had all of his suspicion, and sufficient power to act on their hostility. But \ne biggest failures of the NCF were in the secondary metal-working industries, the foundry \nd machine trades, whose craft union leaders and proprietary capitalists played such a large \nrt in the NCF itself, and whose experiments in union recognition and the creation of \ntional and loc\nomising. \nployers in these skill-dependent industries knew about, and were impressed by, \ncent British experience. After a huge national lock-out in 1897-98, British engineering \nployers had forced 'Terms of Settlement' on the Amalgamated Society of Engineers.  To \nme, this victory demonstrated that associated employers could impose a tolerable deal on \nen the strongest craft union, and then use that union to discipline its members into \nepting harsh terms as a condition of continuing recognition. Widely discussed among the \nembers of the National Founders' and National Metal Trades Associations (NMTA), this \nample was a model for their own struggles with the Iron Molders' Union and the \nternational Association of Machinists in 1899-1904.  The latter's Murray Hill Agreement \nith the NMTA in 1900 embodied \u2018most of the terms, and even some of the phraseology, of \ne \u201cConditions of Management\u201d agreed upon between the Federated Engineering Employers \nGreat Britain and the Allied Trade Unions.\u2019 45 \nBut was this the key message to be derived from the\n 15\nAmericans understood it, but for American employers, the criticism drowned out \nalifications.  Publisher John Murray, who reissued the articles as a book, argued that he \nld[ed] to no one in appreciation of the great work accomplished by trade unions, \nt...their policy of restriction of output and of individual effort is doing more injury to the \ndustrial trade of this country than foreign tariffs.\u2019  The articles\u2019 author, Edwin Pratt, could \nplain that \u2018the point \u2026 was \u2026 not to attack trade unionism \u201cas an institution,\u201d but to deal, \nTh\nco\nen\nSh\nst\nun\nbe\nengin\nre\nan\nco\nbu\nfir\nan\nfollowing sh cousins \nac\nThe\nB\nne\nne\nof \nan\nto\nB\nag\nba\nodel, much as \nNCF-type \nthe qu\n\u2018yie\nbu\nin\nex\ne 1901 Machinists' strike was \u2018a sharp disappointment to the advocates of association and \nnference as a means of averting labor troubles\u2019; \u2018a forecast of the more paralyzing \ncroachments of that unwise trade-unionism which has been Britain's bane.\u2019  Browne & \narpe's superintendent emphasized that \u2018we all agree here at present that the exact issue at \nake is to unionize all the shops in the United States.  That is only a prelude to the unions' \ndertaking later on the management of the machine business.  The effect of that can easily \n seen by studying the situation in Great Britain.\u2019  Thus the message of the British \neering trades\u2019 unhappy experience was not that an acceptable settlement could be \nached after a long and bitter strike, but that even after a supreme effort employers still faced \n intolerable union presence in their shops. As Robert Wuest, the NMTA's aggressive \nmmissioner, told his members in 1904, the real lesson of the British experience was to \nild up a strong enough organization to prevent the need to recognize organized labor in the \nst place.  \u2018Let them take warning by studying the result of Great Britain's former apathy \nd indifference to questions pertaining to labor, and let us avoid the death-dealing blow by \nthat old maxim, \u201cA Stitch in Time,\u201d and let us not wait, as did our Engli\nross the water to \u201clock the stable door,\u201d after the trade is gone.\u201946 \n early 1900s was perhaps the worst time for the NCF and its associates to use the \nritish case to support their project, because American employers'  by then  well-established \ngative stereotypes about British industry and its labor relations were being reinforced by \nws from Britain itself.  These were the years of the (supposed) American \u2018export invasion\u2019 \nthe British home market, and (feared) capture of Britain's export markets.  There was \nxious discussion of the reasons for this comparative failure; and many explanations pointed \nward what The Times labelled, in a series of articles in the Fall of 1901, \u2018The Crisis in \nritish Industry.\u2019  The central theme of the Times articles was that trade unions were \ngressive, restrictive, and pursuing outmoded, destructive policies, if not through formal \nrgaining then very effectively through rank-and-file action.47 \nThis message was mixed up with continuing advocacy of the British m\n 16\nrat\nem\npr\nreached Am\npe\nSc\nprinc\nTh\nso\nha\nco\nea\nth\nfou\nSo why should American employers imitate or import any part of late Victorian \nBritain's la\nFu\nun\ngo\ntra\nflo\nsa\nth\nfe\ny to acknowledge that it has any \ninfl\nchie\ndur\nWith the is\nto listen to\nher, with the abuses that had crept into an organisation which, in the opinion of many \nployers, should occupy a legitimate and even useful place in the scheme of industrial \nogress, so long as it is directed along reasonable lines.\u2019  But the part of the message that \nerican employers was the one they were already inclined to hear.48 \nAt the very same NCF conference in December 1901 that offered up a vision of \naceful collective bargaining in the Anglo-American future, employer member Charles \nhwab, President of U.S. Steel, countered with grim skepticism.  He was, he said, \nipally interested in the labor problem from the angle of its effect on U.S. prosperity.  \ne decline of Great Britain could best be explained by the attitude of labor to capital.  \u2018I am \nrry to say that every labor organization with which I have had experience in the past has \nd as its foundation the restriction of output.  It is that principle which is putting English \nmmerce and English trade in the bad position in which they are today.\u2019  Like Hewitt \nrlier, he did not pronounce against labor unions per se, but he was certainly opposed to \nose actually existing: output-restricting, contract-breaking, etc.  And this was enough of a \nndation on which to build a rigorously anti-labor policy.49 \nbor relations system?  While Britain\u2019s unions were crippling the old country, \u2018[t]he \nture,\u2019 as H.G. Wells would put it in 1906, was \u2018in America\u2019.  In their flight from \ncompetitiveness, it was to America that British employers and managers must look for \u2018the \nspel of good tidings industrially\u2019.50  In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the \nffic of industrial investigators across the Atlantic ran both ways, with a growing counter-\nw of self-critical British observers who wandered through America and liked what they \nw.  Weeks's collaborator Stephen Jeans, summing up the results of a British investigation of \ne iron, steel, and related industries which he organized, reached a conclusion with which \nw American businessmen would disagree: \nThe trade union is not generally recognized as a militant force in the United States \nexcept now and again.  Few employers are read\nuence worth naming.  The almost absolute freedom of labour has been been the \nf instrument whereby it has won such conquests in the field of industrial economy \ning the last quarter of a century.51 \nsues presented in this fashion, who among American employers would be inclined \n the siren voices tempting them to steer their storm-tossed Yankee clipper toward \n 17\nthe Br\nco\nA\n20\nem\n\u2018[\ngi\n\u2018[T\nB\n[I]n\nsaid\npro\nind\norg\nchange, however \nma\nadh\nNone of this demonstrates any conclusive causal conn tween American employers' \nst\nth\nStr\nhi\nin\nex\nex\nin\nal\nwh\n \nitish rocks?  Leaving nothing to chance, Schwab funded a research effort to explore the \nnnection between trade unionism and restriction of output.  American scholars focus on the \nmerican section written by Commons and Walter Weyl. But this is followed by a neglected \n0 page report on Britain, the home of \u2018ca' canny,\u2019 by their collaborator John Gray.  For \nployers, this was dismal reading.  The engineering employers' splendid settlement?  \nT]here is scarcely a single clause...which is not couched in language sufficiently vague to \nve rise to controversy over its interpretation.\u2019 The wonderful record of industrial peace?  \n]he boards of arbitration and conciliation truly give peace by producing sleep.\u2019  The \nritish model was slow, indecisive, and obstructed change:  \n the present state of disputes between the employer and employee, it may justly be \n that the employer has ceased to have any hope of improving the organization, \ncesses, or machinery of his industry.  It is because of this attitude...that English \nustry has reached such a degree of stagnation.  Wherever the workmen are well \nanized they insist that the phrase 'new and untried conditions of work' includes any \ntrivial.  Nothing but a complete adherence to existing organization, \nchinery, material, and methods will satisfy a strong union that employers are \nering to this clause.  The possibility of all experiments is excluded.52 \n* * * \nection be\nrategic decisions for the Open Shop rather than the Trade Agreement, on the one hand, and \ne advice and information they were receiving about British industrial realities, on the other.  \nucturalist political sociologists\u2019 and historians\u2019 arguments in terms of power and interest, \nstory and market context, are obviously the more persuasive. The outcome of American \ndustrialists' debates and uncertainties in the early 1900s was probably overdetermined. But \nceptionalism was built in a transatlantic context; American employers, too, studied British \nperience, not to replicate but to avoid it.53  Like their lib-lab contemporaries, their interest \n it probably declined after the early 1900s: in the case of both groups, their minds were \nready made up, and they did not need new information to confuse the stereotypical views \nich supported their established positions. \n 18\n3. 1917\nAs\ninte\nex\nof\npe\nsu\nA\nga\nen\nis\nal\nin\nm ol, man- and woman-power \nmobilization, and i 55\nown\nde\nca\nD\nta\nev\npr\neconom\nto hold the balance between contending labor and capital and to earn the good will of \nbot\nhav\nleg\nwh\nrep\nThe delega l progressives and the AFL, whose \nleader, Samuel Gompers, was in effect its host.

War \nfered them the possibility of rapid social and institutional change that normal gridlocked \nacetime politics could not deliver. Britain's experiments (and, even more, the rhetoric \nrrounding them) offered hopeful direction for that change, and the strengthening of Anglo-\nmerican strategic collaboration (\u2018Anglophilism became an integral part of American life\u201954) \nve Britain's wartime corporatists a splendid opportunity to do something the British always \njoy, instructing backward folk in lesser nations about how much better the United Kingdom \n at doing things. The picture they relayed to enthusiastic American audiences was of an \nmost perfectly functioning, smoothly-running governmental machine, integrating organized \nterests into policy-making and administration, proceeding by consent and yet delivering a \niracle of munitions production, industrial peace, wage contr\nmproved working conditions.  \nThe British message was convenient for Wilsonian liberals, as well as attractive in its \n right: it told them what they wanted to hear.  Soon after the United States declared war, a \nlegation of British trade union leaders, Labour MPs, and Ministry of Munitions experts \nme to the United States, invited by the Committee on Labor of the Council of National \nefense.  According to them, \u2018Labor in our country has, from the beginning of the war, been \nken into the confidence of the Government, the Government seeking its cooperation on \nery conceivable occasion, and that has been one of the greatest factors in making matters \noceed smoothly.\u2019  The Ministry of Munitions, a huge organization at the heart of the war \ny, saw its role as being  \nh sides....[A]ny good work by which we have arranged that good will could only \ne been done by that hearty cooperation which labor leaders have given to us....No \nislative enactment dealing with labor has gone before the House of Commons \nich has not first been in conference between the minister of munitions and the \nresentatives of organized labor.56   \ntion's message was music to the ears of socia\n 19\ntripartite corporatist\nin\nde\nne\nw\nhu\nyo\nha\npr\nco\nex\nco  the United States and urge and endeavor the safeguarding \nalike the right\nmunitions a\nan\npr\nac\nFo\nm  the deputy head of the Labour \nDepartment of the Ministry of Munitions put it, \nWe \nhav\nthe\ncap\nand\ntog\nTh\nlabo\nal\nw\nth\nth\n basis, where leaders of the 'responsible' labor movement were included \n the councils of state at the highest level, on par with representatives of capital.

If you are going to have a long war nothing is more fatal than to start to exhaust \nur men and women at this stage.\u2019  The British Health of Munitions Workers Committee \nd assembled the best and most authoritative scientific evidence in support of the \noductivity as well as welfare benefits of shorter hours and other improvements in working \nnditions.

As Charles Stillman, \nesident of the American Federation of Teachers, emphasized, \u2018[W]e have grown \ncustomed to looking at England as a Mecca,\u2019 and this was never truer than in 1917-1918. \nr, if the British present was bright, the future glowed brighter yet.  And the industrial \nillennium was heading westward across the Atlantic.  As\nare out to win this war, but we have also got a much wider task than that....[W]e \ne also, after that, to in some sense reorganize the world.  We can only do that...on \n lines on which...we have already started.  We must get labor and government and \nital together.  We must get them working together and get them at conferences, \n we must create between them a spirit of confidence by which they may work \nether loyally and without faltering in order to overcome the ravages of war.58 \nus war made the British model seem more relevant than ever for social progressives and \nr\u2019s friends.  It was useful for American mobilization agencies to be able to draw upon an \nly's experience, avoiding mistakes and imitating success; it was inspiring to have an ally \nho demonstrated that a democracy could also be efficient.  And it was uplifting to believe \nat the sacrifice of war would not be in vain, because the British idea of \u2018reconstruction\u2019 -- \nere was already even a Ministry of that name -- promised a better world after the war.59 \n 20\ngr\nin\nan\nan\nco\nor\nsy\nre\n19 er over cracks in the collapsing truce between labor, \nemployers\nim\nof \nwas si\nlib\nde\npr\nth\nWh\nsi\nfor\nde\nre\nse\nde\nga\nC\nlab\nfavori\nha\nbe\nThe Whitley Committee, a subcommittee of the Ministry of Reconstruction, had \neatest influence on the discourse of U.S. industrial relations. The Committee was tripartite \n structure and corporatist in approach, as were its recommendations for the establishment of \n integrated system of factory, regional, and industrial councils bringing together workers \nd their employers.  In already-organized industries, these councils would build on existing \nllective bargaining structures; elsewhere, there would be government sponsorship, \nganizing employer and union interests until they could manage on their own. Above this \nstem would stand a National Industrial Council; this would also be the principal \ncommendation of the United States National Industrial Conference called in the spring \n19 in a desperate effort to pap\n, and the state. \nThe Whitley scheme is less important for its details -- few of which were ever \nplemented -- than for its impact on the parallel American debate about the vexed question \nhow to put some practical meaning into the notion of \u2018industrial democracy.\u2019  One option \nmply to import bits of the British program.  In July 1919, for example, managerial \neral Henry Dennison handed out copies of the Whitley Report to his employees' \npartmental representatives to give them ideas and models to follow. 60  But such clear, \necise, and direct borrowing was rare. Instead, many of Dennison\u2019s fellow employers saw \ne British example as more relevant than ever before, but still as a threat, not a promise. \nen other American employers reacted both to the Whitley scheme and to \nmultaneous pressures, mediated through the National War Labor Board (NWLB), for some \nm of representation in industry, they rejected the British example except as a point of \nparture or of negative reference.  They had already constructed their own exceptional labor \nlations system after 1903 during the first phase of the Open Shop Era; their challenge in this \ncond, critical phase was to resist any pressures for British-style corporatism and industrial \nmocracy.  The evolution of the thinking of Julius Cohen, attorney for the New York \nrment trade employers through the Era of the Protocol, is instructive.  Before the war, \nohen had proposed the simple, direct importation of British corporatist schemes to solve \nor problems .  But by 1919, chastened by experience, Cohen struck a more patriotic note,  \nng \u2018not a British Plan, or a French Plan, or a Russian Plan, but an American Plan, in \nrmony with our institutions, our laws, our customs and our outlook generally.\u201961 \nJohn D. Rockefeller, Jr, himself, explained what that might mean.  In his address \nfore the War and Reconstruction Conference of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in 1918, \n 21\nguing with one another in print back home about what they observed, and battling to \nluence a business community that they all claimed to represent, with varying degrees of \nausibility.  The most important was sent by the National Industrial Conference Board \nICB), a new organization set up in 1916 to coordinate the work of anti-union employers\u2019 \nciations, to undertake research, propaganda, and strategic thinking on their behalf, and to \npresent them to the public and government.  The crisis of wartime labor relations had made \nese tasks urgent; the NICB\u2019s status had also been boosted by its role as the nominating \ndy for the employers\u2019 delegation on the War Labor Conference Board and NWLB, and \nen providing them with support.  In September 1917, the NICB became alarmed at the \nhe \nco\nin ckefeller firms had been installing since \nbefore the \nfor recogni\nHe\nwh\nunor\nor i\na si n lude all corporations \nR\npr\nla tation to a \npubl\nRo\nth\nth\nch\nun\n \n4. 1919: FROM THE BRITISH MODEL TO THE AMERICAN WAY \nIn 19\nar\ninf\npl\n(N\nasso\nre\nth\nbo\nth\ngave respectful attention to Britain's proposals but endorsed something \u2018less \nmprehensive, and which is constructed from the bottom up\u2019: plant-based, company-\nitiated employee representation, of the kind the Ro\nwar, and that the NWLB had endorsed as a compromise between labor's demands \ntion and employers' resistance. \nre, then, would seem to be a method of providing representation which is just, \nich is effective, which is applicable to all employes (sic) whether organized or \nganized, to all employers whether in associations or not, which does not compete \nnterfere with existing organizations or associations, and which, while developed in \nngle industrial corporation as a unit, may be expanded to i c\nin the same industry and ultimately all industries.62 \nockefeller's proposal was 'American' because it built on what already existed, it relied on \nivate, local initiative, and there was no explicit place in it for either the state or organized \nbor.  Thus Rockefeller set an agenda for his class, both in policy and in presen\nic which required at least the promise of democratic reform.  \nckefeller had pointed a way that other businessmen followed only after undertaking \neir own intensive examination of the contemporary realities of British industrial relations \nat rejected the image peddled by British visitors and their American labor-liberal \neerleaders.  The British model mattered more to American employers than ever before; \nderstanding it correctly might help them decide how to meet labor\u2019s postwar challenge.   \n19, three delegations of American employers travelled around a strike-torn Britain, \n le  the Department, not appointed by any of the business community\u2019s representative \ndies.  None were from large firms or from the heavy metal trades; none had NWLB \nrvice.  They included a small manufacturer of adding machines and an advertising and \nblishing executive from Chicago, a Connecticut cotton-mill owner, a Massachusetts shoe \nanufacturer, a New York watch manufacturer, and a southern construction executive.  They \n either from organized industries or at least from outside the Open Shop movement.  \ney were shepherded around Britain, and to the correct conclusions, by Royal Meeker, \nommissioner of Labor Statistics, and B.M. Squires, chair of the board of arbitration of the \nion-friendly U.S. Shipping Board.  Roger Babson, the Department\u2019s chief publicist, \nplained their purpose and their message: \n22\nim\nto\n10\nal\nem\nB\ntri\nco\ntra\nbr v lutionary mood sweeping all of America\u2019s \nEu opean \n \nar\nLa\nmonths\nsh\nth\nth\nab\nco\nLa\ncha\n The Employers\u2019 Industrial Commission was a propaganda ploy.  Its members were \nse cted by\nbo\nse\npu\nm\nwere\nTh\nC\nun\nex\npact of the message of those dangerous British Ministry of Munitions representatives \nuring the United States calling for the adoption of a British model of war corporatism and \n0 percent unionization.  How could they resist it?  It had all the apparent authority of an \nly\u2019s government behind it.  A fact-finding tour of the United Kingdom by American \nployers, to develop counter-arguments, was suggested, but wartime priorities interfered. \nut, the idea was not forgotten, and with victory in sight in October 1918, planning for the \np began again \u2013 to focus now on problems of reconstruction or, to use the preferred \nnservative American term, readjustment, with its implications of restoration rather than \nnsformation.  Seven months passed before the resulting European Commission \u2013 its remit \noadened because of the apparently re o\nr allies \u2013 could depart.63 \nWhile the NICB thought and prepared, others acted.  Two investigative commissions \nrived in Britain in February 1919, one from the NCF, the other from the U.S. Department of \nbor itself.  The NCF\u2019s was the less important, despite the fact that its members spent four \n in Europe, all but three weeks of them in Britain.  The NCF was by this time a \nadow of its former self, fanatically dedicated to a shrill anti-Communism and support for \ne AFL\u2019s conservative leaders as bulwarks against radicalism.  The delegates were nobodies, \neir comments rarely interesting though sometimes amusingly chauvinistic, their conclusions \nout British employers\u2019 acceptance of trade unionism entirely predictable from a \nnservative corporatist body including AFL representatives.  In contrast, the Department of \nbor\u2019s Employers\u2019 Industrial Commission represented a far more significant and deliberate \nllenge to the emerging anti-labor consensus among American businessmen.64 \n 23\nlike the Department of Labor\u2019s, it was full of open-shop heavyweights, including \nilliam Van Dervoort (president and proprietor of a midwestern engineering firm) and \nyall Osborne (vice-president of Westinghouse), both fresh from fighting the employers' \nrner on the NWLB; Charles Asbury, vice-president of a mid-size, staunchly anti-union, \nily-run foundry and machine shop, Enterprise Manufacturing of Philadelphia; and \nmberton Hutchinson, president of the Westmoreland Coal Co., also of Philadelphia, who \nould be an employer delegate at the President's First Industrial Conference in October 1919 \nplicitly because of the experience he had gained on the European Commission   Its staffer \nBritis\n\u2026 i\nsom\nto a\ndis\nTh\nof\nor\nre\nw\ndi romise \u2026 of constructive cooperative relations which must result in the good \nof all.\u2019  \n Alm\nsu\nin\nab\nor\now\nal\nwas \non\n Determined to counter this dangerous message, the NICB\u2019s commission finally set out \nin May. Un\nW\nLo\nco\nfam\nPe\nw\nex\nh industrial experiences have for many years been along the same paths as ours; \nt may be assumed from industrial history that the United States will follow \newhat later along similar paths as Great Britain.... British employers \u2026 are now \n surprising degree united in the belief that disorganization of the employed spells \norder and all its attendant dangers.  This view is quite in line with the insistent \nmessages of the United States Department of Labor that employers and employees \nshould 'get together,' and that by 'collective bargaining' labor unrest is allayed.65 \nese conclusions were clear and convenient, and were backed by \u2018facts\u2019 and the signatures \n the Department\u2019s hand-picked business team. The friendly relations among government, \nganized employers, and trade unions, and their shared enthusiasm for Whitleyism, was \u2018a \nvelation\u2019 to these hapless provincials \u2013 had they been at all clued up before departure, they \nould not have been remotely surprised -- and would \u2018be a revelation to those at home, \nsclosing the p\n66\nost all sweetness and light, with scarcely a shadow of doubt, their report was \nrprising after a two-month visit to a country where vital public services and major \ndustries were closed by mass strikes, and the commission\u2019s labor interlocutors were frank \nout their radical plans.  As one member later reported, \u2018They would tell us about the new \nder of society that they were going to bring about.  They were going to abolish private \nnership and all that sort of thing; profit was robbery, and so on.  We were considerably \narmed.\u201967  But Meeker, Squires, and Babson did their work so well that the report said what \nintended, offering Americans \u2013 particularly employers -- reassurance about the future, if \nly they followed the British model. \n eneral Motors, told the first national personnel conference that May, \u2018To the manufacturers \naking the world safe for democracy meant to keep what we had -- it meant to preserve the \nstem of private initiative; of voluntary association for business which has made this country \neat.\u2019 The way to do this was by being progressive, within limits, not reactionary; there was \n24\nwas J. Laurence Laughl\nChicago, a\nru\nLa\nan\nem\nre\nm\nbrou\npe\nw\nth\nN\nth\nun\nof \n The NICB\u2019s key recommendation was similar to that of Abram Hewitt and James \nBayles ove\n his personal duty to establish direct and cordial \nrela\nBrit\nthe \nhim\nesta\nexp\nPositive pe\nalso to me\nG\nm\nsy\ngr\nin, professor emeritus of political economy at the University of \n dedicated reactionary and a well-informed, effective polemicist.68 \nThe NICB\u2019s aim was to add credibility to its arguments by thorough research, but it \nshed out an Interim Report in July to counter any immediate fallout from the Department of \nbor report.69  The Commission had the legitimacy that came with its representative status, \nd an advantage over the earlier visitors because of its excellent contacts with British \nployer organizations.  Its resulting understanding of British realities was much more \nalistic, balanced, and complex than the Department of Labor\u2019s airbrushed vision.  Its \nessage, too, was clear; just 180 degrees different:  \u2018The forces which \u2026 have already \nght British industries to such an impasse should not, by our careless passiveness, be \nrmitted to produce the same effects upon our own.\u2019  Britain offered, not a model, but a \nake-up call; an awful prospect of what might happen if American employers failed, like \neir British brethren, to take the responsibilities of power seriously.  The employers the \nICB met \u2018strongly advised\u2019 their American brethren to resist union growth; they admitted \nat too many of them had been \u2018sluggish, thoughtless, unobserving, and selfish\u2019 about taking \nilateral action to improve conditions of labor; they were \u2018largely responsible, by their lack \nprevision, for the existing state of discontent.\u201970 \nr thirty years earlier:  \neach employer should regard it as\ntions with his workers.  It will not do to drift into a policy of neglect, as have some \nish employers in the past, which has borne such bitter fruit in the dissatisfaction of \npresent day.  The employer must see to it that no charge can be brought against \n of not intelligently looking out for the interests of the rank and file in his \nblishment....The employer must take the lead; much in the way of leadership is \nected of him.  He must generally plan to prevent grievances from arising.71   \nrsonnel policies were the way to protect America\u2019s union-free environment and \net American workers\u2019 expectations.

Its report\u2019s \u2018major emphasis\u2019 was \u2018upon conditions in Great Britain, because \ne problems there are obviously most analogous to our own.\u2019  Its investigators simply drew \nferent lessons from those of the labor-liberals.  A key conclusion was that \u2018Collective \nargaining, in the sense of group-bargaining and as contrasted with individual bargaining, \nd without the existence of unions.\u2019  Ironically, the NICB even used the radical \nndicalism of the Shop Stewards\u2019 Movement, which seemed to some labor-liberal observers \n be such a promising means of self-actualization for workers, to demonstrate the \nadequacy of official union structures and support its arguments for plant-based, union-free \nployee representation like that pioneered by the Rockefeller firms. Such representation \nould provide \u2018an opportunity for employers and their employees to meet on matters of local \nd mutual concern.\u2019 \neans of communication between employers and workers is a practical necessity; \ntters of mutual interest necessarily arise for common consideration.  There must \u2026 \nmachinery for discussion of the many questions sure to develop respecting shop \nctices, grievances, wages, hours, and the like.  Hence the natural development of \ne body which would represent the workers in conference with the managers \narding affairs in the shops.  This need arises even where the employer is dealing \nctly with his own men without interference from outside influences.73  \n-placed advisors to American business reached the same conclusion, which \n e Committee) developed: one which \u2018assures unity of interest and co-operation on \ne part of all directly concerned\u2019 without the \u2018distinctly unAmerican\u2019 enforcement of \nionization that he said Whitleyism required.  It would be flexible, adaptable to America\u2019s \neat variety of industrial conditions, simple, direct, and free of government supervision.  It \nould only include \u2018representatives who are employees themselves, and hence\u2026vitally \nested in the company\u2019s success.\u2019  It would build on already established institutions \u2013 the \nkefeller plan and its imitators, including the employee representation schemes devised by \n26\npublished th The Iron Age\nAmerican \n[T]h\nand\nthe \ncre\ncon\nope\ncla\nblunders \nthe\nbe \nof e\nA\nde\nref\nwrit\nth\nw\nw\nan\nin\nem\nnference Plan of Industrial \nD own as the Special \nConferenc\nth\nun\ngr\nw\ninter\nRoc\ne first of a series of articles in  outlining the stark choice facing \nbusiness: \ne employers in our country are where the English employers were decades ago, \n are therefore afforded a fortunate glimpse into the future which awaits them and \nnation if they follow the same course.  Will they not profit by this and endeavor to \nate a factory solidarity more attractive than class solidarity?  Will they not \nvince the workers by actual demonstration that they can gain more through co-\nration with their individual employers than by the militant, anti-social methods of \nss conflict?  \u2026.  The chance still remains in this country to avoid the English \nby erecting an industrial government wherein associated activities beyond \n walls of the individual factory and intercorporate adjustments affecting labor will \nlargely conducted by delegates from the factory rather than national organizations \nmployers and employees.74 \nmerican employers had found their answer to Whitleyism: their own form of industrial \nmocracy.  They would continue to cite British experience in support of this preventive \norm, but wholly negatively.  J. Laurence Laughlin put their argument most amusingly, \ning for a broad middle-class audience in August 1919 \u2013 \u2018If we should be asked to follow \ne example of Great Britain in her labor experiments, it would be much as if a person filled \nith emulation at the success of a menagerie should borrow for his private use a lion which \nould be certain to eat him up.\u201975 Herbert Rice, Treasurer of General Motors, who had been \n employer member of the NWLB, agreed: \u2018I, for one, don't want to see the English system \ntroduced in this country.  England's industrial success can hardly be held up to us for \nulation. . . . Conditions are absolutely different.\u2019 \nRice explained how different in support of the Joint Co\nemocracy that he and unnamed associates (later to become kn\n 27\nthe NWLB\nwhere unli\n The \nthe \nlike\nbut \npie\ndoe t on a dead level classification.

If he did, anything \nmanufacturer did to try to keep him out of the unions would be of no avail.  He \ns the independence and he doesn't join readily.

He \nsn't want to ge\n76\n every point Rice, speaking for the SCC, used the incomparability of British and American \nnditions as a way of specifying what American employers should do.  In the above address \nthe National Association of Employment Managers, he presented a program for business -- \nt simply in devising plans to deal with the labor relations crisis company by company, but \n confronting, head on, the last feeble challenge from a disintegrating Wilson Administration \nthe restoration of a union-free environment. \nco\nto \nno\nin\nto \n* * * \nIn October 1919, an Industrial Conference met in Washington, with labor, business, and \n\u2018p\npa\nau\nex\nle\nindust\nesta\nim\nbe\nch\nco\nan\n \nre ison, AFL \nSecretary-Treasurer, cited the \u2018evidence\u2019 of the Department of Labor\u2019s commission to focus \nublic\u2019 representatives (ironically including Rockefeller), called by President Wilson to \ntch together an industrial truce while the Great Steel Strike was raging \u2013 hardly an \nspicious time. The task was hopeless from the start.  American employers knew by then \nactly what they wanted, and there was no effective pressure on them to settle for anything \nss.  As their group spokesman said, they \u2018came to the conference with a program of \nrial relations\u2019 drafted by the NICB in which Merritt\u2019s was the central principle: \u2018The \nblishment as a productive unit\u2019 was its basis.77  A voluntarist, decentralized, and \nplicitly union-free industrial relations system was all they would accept.  Cleverly, they \nnt labor\u2019s appeal for a practical right for American workers to join a union of their own \noosing, and have it recognized by their employers, into their old spectre of state-enforced \nmpulsory unionization, choosing the grounds on which to resist confident that the judiciary \nd most of the middle-class public would join them there.   \nIn vain, labor\u2019s spokesmen appealed to British precedent, and called for union \ncognition as the best way of managing workers\u2019 discontent.

[They] nearly all agree that collective \nrgaining should always be undertaken between associations of employers under (sic) \ngularly established and recognized trade-unions.\u2019  In Britain\u2019s Whitley-style joint councils \nmployers are required to deal with men or groups of men not in their employ and not \nosen from among their employees.\u2019  Leaving aside whether what he said was true, it cut \nsolutely no ice.  As the best metaphor in the NCF Commission\u2019s report emphasized, there \nas no longer any reason to believe \u2018that medicine good for the bull is good for the eagle.\u201978 \nThe Conference foundered when the employer delegation insisted on the Open Shop, \nith company unionism established alongside of independent unionism as an equally \ngitimate -- and their preferred -- means of employee representation if managers and \norkers in individual establishments wanted it.  American employers had made up their \nnds, which they expressed in a language of confident exceptionalism.  As NICB chairman \nederick Fish, former president of AT&T, put it, the \u2018open\u2019 or \u2018American shop\u2019 was \u2018an \nmerican institution of the highest character,\u2019 and was thus \u2018the only institution \u2026 which we \nally can ... support, as American citizens.\u2019 Homer Ferguson of Newport News Shipbuilding, \neaking for the Chamber of Commerce section of a united employer delegation, emphasized \nat \u2018to establish a condition, whether it is established in England, in Sweden, or any other \nace, whereby a man may not work freely without coercion, without being interfered with, is \nablish an un-American condition, and is to set up a power that, in course of time, will \nvolve us in the troubles of old countries and by that power even we may lose our \npresentative system of government.\u201979   \nThe conference collapsed, the steel strike was fought to a brutal but victorious finish, and \ne American Plan was launched.  A fifty-year perio\nounds and political persuasions had thought they could learn from Britain\u2019s industrial \nperience ended because American employers \u2013 who had studied it closely, and learned \nir own lessons \u2013 had constructed their own system which was so \u2018exceptional\u2019 that \nparisons were no longer either necessary, possible, or useful.   \n* * * \n 29\nTh\nth\nW\nth\nen\nre\nEx\nlab\nem\nno\nex\npe\nai\nex\nhas \nw\nis article\u2019s conclusion must display a proper modesty.  American employers did not build \ne Open Shop order in the early 1900s, and then defend and strengthen it after the First \norld War, because of their interpretation of the British model.  They had all the resources \ney needed close to hand, more than sufficient power, and a uniquely favourable \nvironment.  Instead, the argument must be that the non-union, employer-controlled, \nlatively state-free industrial relations system \u2013 the key element in \u2018American \nceptionalism\u2019 \u2013 was a project to be worked for, not a fact to be taken for granted.  The \nor problem was bitterly contested terrain for three generations of Americans, and \nployer participants in this long debate, just as much as their labor-liberal adversaries, do \nt seem to have spoken or acted as if the outcome was foreordained, or as if other nations\u2019 \nperience had nothing to teach them.  Americans, particularly those of a liberal-labor \nrsuasion, continued to peer into the future of their own industrial relations system with the \nd of a distorted British mirror years after America was institutionally and ideologically \nceptional that, logically, nobody else's experience could be very useful model. This article \ndemonstrated that American employers too looked across the Atlantic; but, increasingly, \nhat they found there was a future to avoid, and important lessons about what not to do.  \n 30\nREFERENCES \n\u2018Arbitration Instead of War.\u2019 New York Times 19 Nov. 1870, p. 4. \n\u2018C . 1918): 11. \n\u2018C\n3-\n\u2018L s of the Season.\u2019 New York Times 10 Nov. 1870, p. 2. \n\u2018M  [editorial \ncomment]. \n\u2018The Engli\n\u2018The Lecture Season.
