INTRODUCTION\nIt is well known that the polarization direction of linearly\npolarized light continuously rotates while it passes through\ncertain materials such as solutions of chiral molecules, solids\nwith rotated crystal planes, and spin-polarized gases. This\nphenomenon of polarization plane rotation during propaga-\ntion is called optical activity. When placed in a magnetic\nfield aligned in the propagation direction of the linearly po-\nlarized light, all atoms and molecules exhibit optical activity.\nThe magnetic-field-induced optical activity is named after its\ndiscoverer Michael Faraday as the Faraday effect.\nWhile it commonly occurs in the transparent spectrum of\na medium, the Faraday effect can be observed in the absorp-\ntive or nontransparent spectrum region via self-induced\ntransparency. Self-induced transparency is a phenomenon\nwhereby optical pulses propagate through a resonant absorp-\ntive medium without energy loss or distortion. Courtens1 pre-\ndicted that a linearly polarized 2\u0001 pulse will undergo the\ngiant Faraday rotation accompanied by no absorption when\npropagating in a resonant medium having the Zeeman split-\nting of the resonant energy levels.\nThe investigation of the Faraday effect in a resonant me-\ndium is of considerable interest for nonlinear optical spec-\ntroscopy, since it provides important information about the\nlevel structure of the quantum system, including the set of\nclosely lying sublevels, due to the Zeeman splitting in an\nexternal magnetic field. The nonlinear Faraday rotation in a\nmedium exhibiting optically induced circular birefringence\nhas been suggested as a mechanism for achieving a stable\npolarization mode locking of a soliton laser.2 On the other\nhand, the magneto-optic Faraday effect allows measurement\nof the magnetic moment dynamics on an ultrafast time scale\nand with high spatial resolution. The time-resolved Faraday\nrotation spectroscopy, in particular, employs pump-probe\ntechniques to prepare and\/or detect a spin population by us-\ning a train of ultrashort optical pulses at a resonance fre-\nquency tuned just above the absorption edge of a semicon-\nductor. It represents a powerful technique for measuring spin\ncoherence in semiconductors, initially used to study the mag-\nnetization dynamics in bulk magnetic semiconductors3 and\nquantum wells.4,5 The more recent application of the time-\nresolved Faraday effect to nonmagnetic semiconductors\nstrikingly reveals long spin coherence times in bulk\nsemiconductors6 and ensembles of electron spins in quantum\ndots \u0002QDs\u0001.7\u20139 Measured rotation angles, however, are usu-\nally quite small \u0002\u0003\u0002rad in bulk GaAs at room temperature10\u0001\nwhich makes the detection of single electron spins difficult.\nNevertheless, observation of Faraday rotation from a time-\naveraged single spin state of a single electron confined in a\nQD has been recently reported.9 In this respect, the giant\nFaraday rotation predicted by Courtens in resonant media in\nthe self-induced transparency regime could be used as a\nprobe of the single confined spin dynamics, in view of quan-\ntum computation applications.\nMost analyses1,11\u201313 of the Faraday effect in a resonant\nmedium consider the situation when the magnetic field is\nweak so that the width of the Zeeman splitting is \u0002much\u0001\nsmaller than the linewidth of the incident light. With the\nstrength of magnetic field on this order of magnitude, it is\nnecessary to use a system of four levels or more \u0002depending\non the angular momentum quantum number of the relevant\nlevels\u0001 to describe the medium. However, if the magnetic\nfield is so strong that the magnitude of the Zeeman splitting\nis much larger than the linewidth of the relevant transitions\nand the bandwidth of the incident light, the light cannot be\nresonant with more than one transition \u0002Fig. 1\u0001. We refer to\nthe magnetic field that can induce the Zeeman splitting sat-\nisfying this condition as an ultra-strong. Under such a mag-\nnetic field, if the central frequency of the incident light\nis tuned with the resonant frequency of a transition with\n\u0003M =1 or \u0003M =\u22121 \u0002\u0003M represents the magnetic quantum\nnumber difference between the upper level and the lower\nlevel of the transition\u0001, the effect from this transition on the\nincident light will be much larger than that from other tran-\nsitions and the interaction of the light with the medium can\nbe effectively considered as an interplay of the light with a\ntwo-level medium.\nPHYSICAL REVIEW B 77, 134304 \u00022008\u0001\n1098-0121\/2008\/77\u000213\u0001\/134304\u00027\u0001 \u00a92008 The American Physical Society134304-1\nIn this paper, we consider the Faraday effect in a resonant\nabsorptive medium under an ultra-strong magnetic field.\nMore specifically, we investigate the Faraday rotation of a\n2\u0001 pulse and show that its characteristics are significantly\ndifferent from those in a weak \u0002to moderately strong\u0001 mag-\nnetic field. Some suggestions for experimental observation of\nthe predicted phenomena are also given.\nII. THEORETICAL MODEL\nConsider a linearly polarized laser pulse propagating in a\nresonant medium along the direction of an ultra-strong mag-\nnetic field. Under the above mentioned conditions, the light-\nmedium interaction can be effectively described by the inter-\naction of the light with a two-level quantum system. The\nsystem Hamiltonian H=H0\u2212p \u00b7E is composed of an unper-\nturbed part H0 which determines the energy separation of the\ntwo levels, and an interaction Hamiltonian in dipole approxi-\nmation Hint=\u2212p \u00b7E, where p and E are the electric dipole\nmoment operator and the light electric field vector,\nrespectively.14\u201317 Here, we only consider the case of \u0003M\n=1 transition; the case of \u0003M =\u22121 can be analogously\ntreated. When denoting the propagation direction as z, the\nsystem Hamiltonian for \u0003M =1 transition can be written\nas18,19\nH =\u0004 0 \u2212\n\u0004\n2\n\u0002Ex \u2212 iEy\u0001\n\u2212\n\u0004\n2\n\u0002Ex + iEy\u0001 \u0005\u00060 \u0005 , \u00021\u0001\nwhere \u00060 is the transition frequency, \u0004 the dipole transition\nmatrix element, and Ex and Ey are the x and y components of\nthe light electric field vector, respectively.\nThe dynamical evolution of the system can then be deter-\nmined by the Liouville equation i\u0005\u0001\u0007 \/\u0001t= \u0006H ,\u0007\u0007 for the den-\nsity operator \u0007 in the Hilbert space. To simplify the analysis\nand to couple the time-evolution equations to the Maxwell\ncurl equations for the real E- and H-field components, we\nuse the real pseudospin vector,15,18\u201321 S\b\u0002S1 ,S2 ,S3\u0001\n\b\u0006Tr\u0002\u0007\b1\u0001 ,Tr\u0002\u0007\b2\u0001 ,Tr\u0002\u0007\b3\u0001\u0007, instead of the complex den-\nsity matrix \u0007 to describe the system evolution \u0002\b1, \b2, and \b3\nare the Pauli matrices\u0001.

The equilibrium value of an absorp-\ntive medium is usually set to be \u00020,0 ,\u22121\u0001. One benefit of\nusing the pseudospin vector is that its components are related\nto the real physical quantities: S1 and S2 represent, respec-\ntively, the dispersive and absorptive components of the po-\nlarization; S3 corresponds to the fractional population differ-\nence of the two energy levels.16\nThe macroscopic polarization density induced in the me-\ndium can be calculated by using P=\u2212N\tp\n=\u2212N Tr\u0002\u0007p\u0001,\nwhere N is the resonant dipole density.

NUMERICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nSince Eqs. \u00022\u0001 and \u00023\u0001 combined with Eq. \u00024\u0001 and bound-\nary condition \u00025\u0001 cannot be analytically solved, we use the\nfinite difference time domain method to numerically solve\nthe system. We consider a 2\u0001 hyperbolic secant \u0002sech\u0001 pulse\nwith a central wavelength \u000b=800 nm and \n=150 fs propa-\ngating in a 300 \u0002m long medium with refractive index n\n=1.0029 and dipole coupling \u0004=4.8\f10\u221228 C m. To numeri-\ncally achieve a 2\u0001 pulse, we use the technique from Ref. 16\nto compensate for the energy discrepancy between a theoret-\nical 2\u0001 pulse and a numerical one, i.e., setting t0=10\n and\ndividing E0 by \rarctan\u0002sin u\u0001\r\n\u221210\n10\n. We also set T1=100 ps and\nT2=10 ps so that the system satisfies the \u0002sharp-line limit\u0001\ncondition of self-induced transparency, T1 ,T2\r\n. The upper\nand lower rows of Fig. 2 show the pulse shapes and popula-\ntion difference profiles for N=1.0\f1019 and N=2.0\n\f1019 m\u22123, respectively. One can see that, when propagating\nacross the medium, the initial linearly polarized pulse \u0006Figs.\n2\u0002a1\u0001 and 2\u0002b1\u0001\u0007 becomes elliptically polarized \u0006Figs. 2\u0002a2\u0001\nand 2\u0002b2\u0001\u0007 and the Faraday rotation along the pulse duration\nis inhomogeneous. The blowups of the central portion of the\npulse at z=280 \u0002m \u0006Figs. 2\u0002a3\u0001 and 2\u0002b3\u0001\u0007 illustrate that, in\ntime coordinate, the amplitude Ay of Ey is zero at the peak of\nthe pulse \u0002denoting the peak time as t= tp\u0001. Figures 2\u0002a2\u0001 and\n2\u0002b2\u0001 show that, in the vicinity of the peak point, Ay is a\nnonmonotonic function, initially increasing in absolute value\nwith the increase in \rt\u2212 tp\r, reaching a maximum, and subse-\nquently decreasing.

Therefore, Eq. \u000213\u0001 can be written down\nin the following approximation form:\n\u00012Ey\n\u0001t2\n\u000e \u2212\n1\n\t\n\u00012Py\n\u0001t2\n. \u000214\u0001\nIntegrating twice Eq. \u000214\u0001 and using the initial condition\nEy\u0002z ,0\u0001= Py\u0002z ,0\u0001=0 and boundary condition Ey\u00020,\u000e\u0001\n= Py\u00020,\u000e\u0001=0, we get\nEy = \u2212 Py\/\t . \u000215\u0001\nCombining Eqs. \u00023b\u0001 and \u000210b\u0001, with Eq. \u000215\u0001, we get\nEy =\nN\u0004\n\t\nsech\u000b t\u0001 \u2212 t0\n\n\n\ftanh\u000b t\u0001 \u2212 t0\n\n\n\fcos\u0002\u00060t\u0001\u0001 . \u000216\u0001\nThis expression is valid when the amplitude of Ey is very\nsmall compared to that of Ex, and this condition is satisfied\nwithin a very short time interval after the pulse enters the\nresonant medium. The above analysis shows that, as long as\nthese assumptions are valid, Ay will always have a zero point\nwhen t=z \/V+ t0. This is significantly different from the Far-\naday effect of a 2\u0001 pulse under a weak magnetic field.1,11\nFrom Eq. \u00022\u0001 in Ref. 11, the rotation angle \u000f under weak\nmagnetic field can be calculated by \u000f=Az, where A is a con-\nstant depending on the system parameters such as dipole\ndensity and pulse width, but independent of time and posi-\ntion. So, for an initial pulse given by Eq. \u00025\u0001, the Ey compo-\nnent will have the expression: Ey =E0 sin\u0002Az\u0001sech\u0006\u0002t\u0001\n\u2212 t0\u0001 \/\n\u0007cos\u0002\u00060t\u0001\u0001. So, when t=z \/V+ t0, the amplitude of Ey\nalways reaches its maximum, E0 sin\u0002Az\u0001.\nAlthough Eq. \u000216\u0001 is only valid in an infinitesimal time\ninterval after the pulse enters the medium, it can still assist\nour understanding of the initial evolution tendency of the Ey\ncomponent. Figure 3 is a schematic plot of Ax=sech\u0002t\n\u2212z \/V\u0001, Ay =0.25 sech\u0002t\u2212z \/V\u0001tanh\u0002t\u2212z \/V\u0001, and S3=\u22121\n+2 sech2\u0002t\u2212z \/V\u0001. It is qualitatively similar to the amplitude\nprofiles in Figs. 2\u0002a2\u0001 and 2\u0002b2\u0001. Equation \u000216\u0001 successfully\npredicts that Ay at two sides of the peak time t\u0001= t0 are sym-\nmetric in amplitude but have opposite signs \u0006consistent with\nFigs. 2\u0002a3\u0001 and 2\u0002b3\u0001\u0007. It also indicates that the two extrema\nof Ay correspond to the two absolute value maxima of Ey\nalong the pulse duration \u0006see Figs. 2\u0002a2\u0001 and 2\u0002b2\u0001\u0007.\nFigure 4 shows the field and population inversion profiles\nat three different positions \u0002columns\u0001 for three different di-\npole densities \u0002rows\u0001. From all three rows, one can discern a\ncommon phenomenon: the magnitude of the Ey component\nincreases with the increase in the propagation distance. For a\nrelatively low dipole density, N=2.0\f1019 m\u22123 \u0002first row\u0001,\nat z=48 \u0002m, the population difference exhibits an approxi-\nmately symmetric profile with a maximum nearly aligned\nwith the pulse peak point \u0006see Fig. 4\u0002a1\u0001\u0007. With the increase\nin z, the peak point of the population difference profile shifts\ntoward the tail of the pulse \u0006see Figs. 4\u0002a2\u0001 and 4\u0002a3\u0001\u0007. In-\ncreasing the dipole density can make this shift more severe at\nthe same position. For N=2.5\f1020 m\u22123 \u0002second row\u0001, the\nshift is already very obvious at z=48 \u0002m \u0006see Fig. 4\u0002b1\u0001\u0007,\nleading to a change in the pulse shape of the Ex component\nand eventually splits the main pulse into two \u0006see Figs. 4\u0002b2\u0001\nand 4\u0002b3\u0001\u0007. This pulse splitting phenomenon cannot be ob-\nserved in weak \u0002or moderately strong\u0001 magnetic field where a\n2\u0001 pulse is predicted to propagate undistorted.1,11\nComparing figures in each column in Fig. 4, one can no-\ntice that the increase in dipole density increases the speed of\ngrowth of the Ey component, and, with the increase in N, the\ncoherent stimulated emission \u0002resonance florescence\u000122 after\nthe main pulse also becomes apparent.

Further increase in the dipole density can make this\nprocess faster. The dependence of the coherent emission on\nthe system parameters and how the enhanced coherent emis-\nsion destroys self-induced transparency will be discussed in\na separate paper. Since the coherence emission from a \u0003M\n=\u00101 transition is always circularly polarized, the increase in\ncoherent emission with increasing the propagation distance z\nindicates that the field tends to be a circularly polarized wave\nwhen propagating further away. This tendency can be seen in\nall three rows.\nIV. SOME VIEWS ON EXPERIMENTAL OBSERVATION\nTo observe the phenomena predicted in the above simula-\ntion, the experimental system should first satisfy the condi-\ntions for self-induced transparency observation. These in-\nclude that \u00021\u0001 the central frequency of the incident sech pulse\nshould be nearly resonant with the transition frequency and\n\u00022\u0001 the pulse duration should be much shorter than the popu-\nlation relaxation and polarization dephasing times. Besides\nthese conditions, the observation of the predicted phenomena\nrequires that the Zeeman splitting of the relevant energy lev-\nels should be large enough, so that the differences of the\nintrinsic frequencies of nearby transitions are much larger\nthan the linewidth of the dipole optical transitions involved\nand the bandwidth of the incident light.\nIt is well known that the self-induced transparency has\nalready been observed in atomic vapors,24 erbium-doped\nwaveguides,25 and semiconductors.26 In principle, all these\nthree kinds of systems can be used to observe the phenomena\npredicted here provided that the available magnetic field is\nstrong enough to induce a sufficiently large Zeeman splitting.\nHowever, the following analysis indicates that the semicon-\nductor system might be the most convenient one among them\nfor the observation of the predicted phenomena.\nDue to many broadening effects such as the Doppler ef-\nfect, atomic vapors will usually have much larger linewidth\nthan that of a solid-state system. A magnetic field that is\nstronger than the maximum magnetic field available in labo-\nratory may be needed to satisfy the condition for the Zeeman\nsplitting, although some techniques such as replacing the va-\npor cell by an atomic beam24 can be used to reduce the\nbroadening effects.\nIn the erbium-doped fiber system, because of the small\nmagnitude \u00021.4\f10\u221232 C m\u0001 \u0002Ref. 25\u0001 of the dipole moment\nconstant and the limitation of the doping density, a medium\nlength on the scale of meters might be necessary to produce\n(a1) (a2) (a3)\n(b1) (b2) (b3)\n(c1) (c2) (c3)\nFIG. 4. \u0002Color online\u0001 Evolution of a 2\u0001 pulse in a medium with different atom densities \u0002first row: N=2.0\f1019 m\u22123; second row:\nN=2.5\f1020 m\u22123; and third row: N=2.5\f1022 m\u22123\u0001 at \u0006\u0002a1\u0001, \u0002b1\u0001, and \u0002c1\u0001\u0007 z=48 \u0002m, \u0006\u0002a2\u0001, \u0002b2\u0001, and \u0002c2\u0001\u0007 z=144 \u0002m, and \u0006\u0002a3\u0001, \u0002b3\u0001,\nand \u0002c3\u0001\u0007 z=280 \u0002m. \u0002Note that Ex and Ey are normalized with respect to E0.\u0001\nFARADAY EFFECT IN A SHORT PULSE PROPAGATING\u2026 PHYSICAL REVIEW B 77, 134304 \u00022008\u0001\n134304-5\nsignificant rotation for observation. To generate an ultra-\nstrong, uniform static magnetic field on such a length scale\nwill bring inconveniences to experiments.\nSemiconductors usually have larger dipole moments than\nthat of the atoms in the erbium-doped fiber systems. For\nexample, the dipole moment of GaAs is on the order of\n10\u221228 C m. On the other hand, the dipole density in a semi-\nconductor increases with the optical excitation intensity.\nTherefore, a relatively short medium length \u0002on the scale of\nmicrons or smaller\u0001 is sufficient to produce significant rota-\ntion for observation. Furthermore, in a bound exciton state\n\u0002such as in CdS\u000126 or in an excitonic state of a quantum well\nor a quantum dot, the quantum levels can be considered as\natomiclike levels and some of them have a small linewidth.\nAll these characters make some carefully selected semicon-\nductor systems the most convenient choice for the observa-\ntion of the phenomena predicted above. One example of\nthese systems is the GaAs \/AlxGa1\u2212xAs quantum well or\nsuperlattice.27\nAccording to the photocurrent spectrum of the\nGaAs \/AlxGa1\u2212xAs superlattice \u0002Fig. 4 of Ref. 27\u0001, under an\n8 T magnetic field, the 2s electron-heavy-hole transition has\na Zeeman splitting energy of 2.5 meV. If we assume a linear\nincrease in the splitting energy with the magnetic field, a\n40 T magnetic field, which is slightly lower than the maxi-\nmum magnetic field currently available in laboratory, will\nlead to a 12.5 meV splitting energy. The measurement in\nRef. 27 indicates that under applied electric field of 9 V \/cm,\nthe two resulting states have linewidths of about 2.2 and\n2.4 meV. However, the linewidth should be much smaller\nwithout an applied electric field. Therefore, considering an\nexperiment by using a sech pulse with a full width at half\nmaximum of several picoseconds \u0002say 6 ps\u0001, based on a nor-\nmal minimum time-bandwidth product of 0.32 for a sech\npulse,28 a pulse of 6 ps duration would have a bandwidth of\n\u0003\u0006=0.32 \/6\f10\u221212\u000e5.33\f1011 Hz, which translates into\nenergy units as \u0003E=5.33\f1011 \/2.418\f1014\u000e2.2 meV.\nFor an unbiased system with magnetic field of 40 T applied,\nthis pulse can be considered to approximately satisfy the\ncondition for observation of these predicted phenomena.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nWe have presented a model for describing Faraday rota-\ntion when the Zeeman splitting induced by the magnetic field\nis much larger than the linewidth of the relevant transitions\nand the bandwidth of the incident light. Numerical investi-\ngation shows that the Faraday effect under this condition is\nsignificantly different from that caused by weak \u0002to moder-\nately strong\u0001 magnetic field. Some views on the experimental\nobservation of the predicted phenomena are given.\nSince the nonlinear Faraday rotation in a resonant me-\ndium under weak \u0002to moderately strong\u0001 magnetic field can\nbe considered as a resonant coherent light interaction with\ndiscrete multilevel systems, the special case of coherent Far-\naday rotation investigated here might be used as the basic\nbuilding block of a more sophisticated model describing the\neffect in the currently experimentally accessible range of\nmagnetic-field strengths. A thorough understanding of this\nsimple model may facilitate the description of the Faraday\neffect in more complex systems.\nFinally, we want to point out one limitation of this model.\nThe present model assumes that the contributions from other\ntransitions can be neglected due to the applied ultra-strong\nmagnetic field. Because the magnitude of the applied mag-\nnetic field can only enter the model through the magnitude of\nthe Zeeman splitting of the relevant energy levels, and within\nthe two-level model this information is no longer available,\nneglecting the contributions from other transitions in this\nmodel simplifies the analysis at the cost of losing the infor-\nmation of the magnitude of the applied magnetic field.\nTherefore, it is impossible to represent the Faraday rotation\nas a function of the applied magnetic field by using this\nsimplified model. To describe the quantitative relationship\nbetween the Faraday rotation and the applied magnetic field,\none needs to extend this model to include contributions from\nat least one more transition. Work in this direction is cur-\nrently underway.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThis research is supported by the EPSRC under Grant No.\nEP\/D060958\/1.\n1 E. Courtens, Phys. Rev.
