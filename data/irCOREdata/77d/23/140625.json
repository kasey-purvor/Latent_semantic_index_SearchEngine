Quantification was by liquid chromatography\ntandem mass spectrometry. Method detection limits for the analytes in the dissolved\nphase were 1.2 to 9.6 ng l-1 for alkylphenol, short chain (n = 1\u20133) APEO and APEC,\nand 0.1 \u2013 4.1 ng l-1 for long chain alkylphenol polyethoxylates. The method detection\nlimit for adsorbed phase samples ranged from 6 to 60 ng g-1 for AP, short chain\nAPEO and APEC; and long chain APEO ranged from 0.5 \u2013 20 ng g-1. The method\nwas utilised to evaluate the removal of these compounds over a trickling filter\nwastewater treatment plant. The major biotransformation products of nonylphenol\npolyethoxylate, nonylphenoxy acetic acid and nonylphenoxy monoethoxy acetic acid\nwere present in the final effluent at concentrations ranging from 35 \u2013 1797 ng l-1.\nShort chain APEO were present in higher proportions in the suspended solids , due to\ntheir higher affinity to particulate matter compared to the long chain oligomers.\n2Keywords: Alkylphenol; alkylphenol polyethoxylates; alkylphenoxy carboxylates;\ntrickling filter; liquid chromatography- tandem mass spectrometry\n1. Introduction\nAlkylphenol polyethoxylates (APEO) are non-ionic surfactants widely used in\ncommercial and domestic applications with a worldwide production of approximately\n500 kilotons (Petrovic and Barcelo, 2001a; Langford and Lester, 2002). Although a\nvoluntary ban on APEO use in household cleaning products was introduced in 1995 in\nnorthern Europe (including the UK), followed by restrictions on industrial cleaning\napplications in 2000 (Renner, 1997); these surfactants are still used in substantial\namounts in institutional and industrial applications. However, octylphenol ethoxylates\n(OPEO) and nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEO) remain two of the most common\nsurfactants in commercial use. APEO are continuously discharged into sewage\ntreatment works (STW) or directly released into the aquatic environment (Langford et\nal., 2005).\nEnvironmental concern in relation to these compounds results from their estrogenic\nactivity (Jobling and Sumpter, 1993; Jobling et al., 1996; Routledge and Sumpter,\n1996; Sonnenschein and Soto, 1998; Petrovic and Barcelo, 2002). Biodegradation of\nAPEO during biological wastewater treatment can occur under both aerobic and\nanaerobic conditions and results in the production of more persistent and estrogenic\nmetabolites; short chain APEO and alkylphenols (AP) including nonylphenol (NP),\noctylphenol (OP) and AP mono- to triethoxylates (NP1EO, NP2EO and NP3EO)\n(Giger et al., 1984). The biodegradation of APEO has been well documented (Ahel et\nal., 1994a; Di Corcia et al., 1998; Di Corcia et al., 2000; Jonkers et al., 2001; Staples\net al., 2001; Petrovic and Barcelo, 2003; Langford et al., 2007). Information about the\nconcentrations and mass balances of APEO and their degradation metabolites in the\nenvironment, especially STW, and sewage sludge treatment processes (Scrimshaw\nand Lester, 2002), is essential in assessing the environmental impact of these\ncompounds.\nAnalysis of APEO and their metabolites is a complex process due to the ethoxylated\noligomers and alkyl-chain isomers which can be present (Langford et al., 2004;\nScrimshaw et al., 2004). Gas chromatography (GC) and liquid chromatography (LC),\nare now commonly used for the determination of APEO. The direct use of GC for\nanalysis is limited to surfactants with lower numbers of ethoxy groups, while\n3metabolic products and long chain ethoxylates require derivatization to increase\nvolatility. Traditionally, LC analysis with fluorescence (Kiewiet and De Voogt, 1996;\nBennie et al., 1997; Ahel et al., 2000; Marcomini et al., 2000) or ultraviolet (Ahel and\nGiger, 1985a, b; Zhou et al., 1990) detection has been widely used for monitoring\nAPEO. However, these techniques often lack the sensitivity and specificity required at\nlow concentrations. Liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry\n(MS\/MS) is now increasingly being used to determine these alkylphenolic compounds\n(Jonkers et al., 2001; Houde et al., 2002; Loyo-Rosales et al., 2003; Petrovic et al.,\n2003; Schmitz-Afonso et al., 2003; Jahnke et al., 2004). Most studies describe\nLC\/MS\/MS analysis of only a limited number of the analytes either NPEO and\nNPECs (Jonkers et al., 2001; Houde et al., 2002; Petrovic et al., 2003), AP1-3EOs and\nAP (Ferguson et al., 2001), or AP1-5EOs, AP and APEC (Loyo-Rosales et al., 2003;\nSchmitz-Afonso et al., 2003; Jahnke et al., 2004; Loos et al., 2007).\nThis study aims to develop a highly sensitive and specific analytical method to detect\nan increased number of alkylphenolic compounds (NP1-12EO, OP1-12EO, NP and OP),\nincluding carboxylated metabolites in sewage matrices (in both dissolved and\nadsorbed samples) and attempts to achieve lower detection limits. This method is\nsuccessfully applied to a trickling filter works (TF) over which a mass balance has\nbeen attempted. The trickling filter work was chosen since many of the STWs in the\nsouth eastern of U.K. still employ these processes and there are not many studies\nreported in the literature on the fate and occurrence of APEO in such processes.\n2. Experimental section\n2.1. Reagents and chemicals\nThe technical 4-nonylphenol mixture of chain isomers and 4-tert-octylphenol were\nobtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Gillingham, Dorset, UK). The long-chain OPEO and\nNPEO were available in technical mixtures (Igepal CO210, CO520, CO720) and\n(Igepal CA210, CA520, CA720) respectively containing a range of oligomers (Sigma-\nAldrich). Nonyl- and octyl-phenoxy acetic acid (NP1EC, OP1EC), 4-nonyl- and\noctylphenolmono- and diethoxylate (NP1\u20132EO, OP1\u20132EO) were obtained from QMX\nLaboratories (Thaxted, Essex, UK). Standards for NP2EC, NP3EC, OP2EC, OP3EC\nwere not available commercially. Due to the absence of commercially available\nstandards, NP2EC and NP3Ec were quantified with NP1EC standard, assuming similar\nresponse factors. Similarly OP2EC and OP3EC were determined with OP1EC standard\nassuming similar response factors.\n4Acetone, ethylacetate (EtOAc), acetonitrile (ACN), methanol (MeOH) and\ndichloromethane (DCM) were obtained from Rathburn (Walkerburn, Scotland, UK)\nand acetic acid from Sigma-Aldrich. Single standard stock solutions were prepared in\nacetonitrile. Reagent grade MilliQ water (18.2 M\u03a9) (Millipore, Watford, UK) was\nused for spikes and preparation of solutions. The working standard solutions were\nprepared by further diluting the stock standard solutions with acetonitrile\/MilliQ-\nwater (50:50 v\/v).\n2.2. Analytical procedure\nFor determination of dissolved concentrations, settled sewage (100 ml) or final\neffluent (250 ml) was filtered through a Whatman GF\/C filter (0.45 \u2013 1 \u00b5m)\n(Whatman, Maidstone, UK.). The 100ml\/250ml aqueous phase was then utilised for\nsolid phase extraction (SPE) as described below. Solid phase extraction was\nperformed using a syringe barrel tC18 (500 mg, 3cc) cartridge. The appropriate\nvolume of sample was loaded onto the cartridges which were preconditioned with 5ml\nmethanol followed by 5ml MilliQ water. The flow rate for sample extraction was kept\nconstant between 5-10 ml min-1 under vacuum using Waters Sep-Pak Vacuum\nManifold (Waters Ltd, Watford, UK.). When the sample had passed through, 4 ml of\nreagent grade water was used to rinse the solid phase; the cartridge was then dried by\ndrawing air through it for half an hour. The analytes were eluted using 10 ml EtOAc,\n10 ml DCM followed by 5 ml 0.1% acetic acid in methanol. A rotary evaporator\n(Heidolph Instruments, Schwabach, Germany) was employed to concentrate the\nextracts to 1 ml which was then evaporated to complete dryness under a gentle stream\nof nitrogen. The extract was reconstituted with 0.25 ml ACN\/MQ-H2O (50:50 v\/v)\nand transferred to an autosampler vial prior to analysis using LC\/MS\/MS.\nThe determination of alkylphenolic compounds in the adsorbed phase was also\nperformed in this study. In order to prevent biotransformation and possible thermal\ndecomposition of the long chain alkylphenolic compounds, samples were freeze-dried.\nA solvent mixture 10ml MeOH\/Acetone (1:1 v\/v) was used to extract the\nalkylphenolic compounds. A clean-up step involved using silica SPE cartridge and\nelution of all analytes from the SPE using 10ml of 10% acetic acid in MeOH.\nSubsequent to the elution of these compounds from the silica SPE, reconstituted with\n0.25 ml ACN\/MQ-H2O (50:50 v\/v) and transferred to an autosampler vial prior to\nanalysis using LC\/MS\/MS,\n52.3. LC\/MS\/MS analysis\nAnalytes were determined using LC\/ESI\/MS\/MS consisting of an HPLC (Waters\nAlliance HPLC system 2695) coupled to a Waters Quattro Premier XE mass\nspectrometer with a Z-Spray ESI source (Micromass, Manchester, UK.). The AP,\nAPEC and APEO were separated on a Gemini C18 column (3\u00b5m particle size,\n100mm x 2mm i.d., Phenomenex, Macclesfield, UK.). The mass spectrometer was\noperated in the negative electrospray ionisation (ESI\u2013) (i.e. AP and APEC) or positive\nelectrospray mode (ESI+) (i.e. APEO) using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM).\nInstrument control, data acquisition and evaluation were performed with MassLynx\nsoftware 4.1 (Waters Ltd, Hertfordshire, UK.). Nitrogen was used as the nebuliser gas\nand argon as the collision gas. The conditions for detection by the mass spectrometer\nwere as follows, capillary voltage, 3.20kV in the positive mode and -2.3kV in the\nnegative mode, extractor lens at 3.0V, RF lens at 0.5 V in the positive mode and 1.0V\nin the negative mode, multiplier voltage, 650V, desolvation gas flow, 1000 l h-1, cone\nvoltage as shown in Table 1, cone gas flow at 50 l h-1, desolvation temperature at\n350\u00b0C and source temperature at 120\u00b0C.\nTwo separate chromatographic runs were used, one for the separation of AP1-12EO;\nand the other for AP1-2EO, APEC and APs. In both cases, separation was achieved\nusing MQ water containing 20mM NH4OH (solvent A) and ACN containing 20mM\nNH4OH (solvent B). The use of ammonia results in formation of the NH4+ adduct ions\nby the APEO, rather than more stable sodium adducts, which facilitates fragmentation\nof parent ions in the collision cell of the MS\/MS (Table 1). The gradient conditions\nfor AP1-12EO were; time zero, 45% solvent B (5 min) followed by a linear increased\nin gradient to 80% solvent B which was maintained for 40 min. Following this the\ngradient, the conditions were maintained at 90% solvent B for 5 min before the\ncolumn was re-equilibrated to starting conditions at 20% solvent B. The total run time\nwas 50 min and A sample volume of 10\u00b5l was injected at a flow rate of 0.2 ml min-1.\nConditions for the AP1-2EO, APEC and APs started with 20% solvent B increasing to\n45% over 10 min. This was followed by a linear increased to 80% solvent B which\nwas maintained for 20 minutes. Following the increase gradient from 80 to 90%\nsolvent B, the conditions were maintained at 90% solvent B for 5 min before the\n6column was re-equilibrated to starting conditions at 20% solvent B for 10 min prior to\nnext run. Similarly, the total run time for this analysis was 50 min with 10 \u00b5l sample\nvolume injected and flow rate was kept at 0.2 ml min-1.\n3. Results\n3.1 Optimization of LC and MS\/MS conditions\nThe optimized LC\/MS\/MS conditions used for compound identification are presented\nin Tables 2. Analysis was performed in the MRM mode, parent ions were [M \u2013 H]\u2013\nfor AP, APEC, and [M + NH4]+ for APEO. The optimized characteristic MRM\nprecursor to product ion pairs monitored for the quantification of the compounds\ntogether with cone voltage, collision energy and sensitivity of the MS\/MS for the\ncompounds investigated is presented in Table 1. The compound-dependent instrument\ndetection limit (IDL) was calculated by a S\/N ratio of 3 from the MRM\nchromatograms for the standard mixture with an injection volume of 10 \u00b5l. The\nsensitivity of the instrument for AP, short chain APEO and APEC ranged from 3 \u2013 58\npg. The sensitivity for the NPEO ranged from 0.2 to 13.4 pg while OPEO ranged from\n0.1 to 8.6 pg.\nPlease insert Table 1.\n3.2 Evaluation of method performance\nThe recoveries and relative standard deviations were determined in experiments\nwhere the analytes in the dissolved phase were in the concentration range of 0.1 \u00b5g l-1\n(low spike) and 1 \u00b5g l-1 (high spike) using MQ water and wastewater samples (n = 3).\nFiltration of the wastewater samples was undertaken prior to SPE to remove particles.\nRecoveries in MQ water (low and high spikes) ranged from 71% to 98% for AP,\nAPEO and APEC. Generally, the relative standard deviations (RSDs) were in the\nrange of 2 to 7. Typically, recoveries for settled sewage (low and high spikes) ranged\nfrom 62% to 98% for AP, APEO and APEC. Relative standard deviation obtained\nwere 2 to 8 for these alkylphenolic compounds. Recovery values and RSD were\nsimilar for spiked (low and high) final effluent samples for all alkylphenolic\ncompounds.\nThe recoveries and relative standard deviations were also determined in experiments\nof adsorbed samples where the analytes were in the concentration range of 0.125 \u00b5g g-\n1 (low spike) and 1.25 \u00b5g g-1 (high spike) using suspended solids samples (n=3) and\n7sludge samples (n=3). Recoveries for adsorbed phased ranged from 51% to 105% for\nAP, APEO and APEC for low and high spikes and their corresponding RSDs were in\nthe range of 1 to 14. Recoveries in spiked sludge ranged from 51% to 104% for AP,\nAPEO and APEC and their RSDs ranged from 1 to 8. This methodology demonstrates\nthat consistent recovery values and low RSD could be obtained from different\nmatrices.\n3.3 Fate and behaviour in a trickling filter works\nThe method was applied for the determination of nonyl- and octylphenol compounds\nin settled sewage and final effluent at a trickling filter treatment plant. Sampling was\nundertaken winter, with the sewage temperature at 10\u00b0C. The concentrations of the\nnonylphenol ethoxylates and associated carboxylates are shown in Fig. 1,\ndemonstrating the change in distribution following the biological process and the\naffinity of the parent nonylphenol for the solid phase. In the settled sewage, the higher\nethoxylates (NP4-12EO) accounted for 91% of the nonylphenol compound flux (3908\nmg d-1) in the settled sewage, with a similar distribution observed for the octylphenol\noligomers, with the OP4-12EO accounting for 58% of the flux (218 mg d-1) in the\nsettled sewage (Table 2). Following the biological treatment stage, the distribution of\nboth nonyl- and octylphenol compounds was significantly altered, with carboxylated\nmetabolites with one to three ethoxy units dominating the distribution of nonylphenol\ncompounds (58%) and being significant for the octylphenols (OP1-3EC, 20%). Overall\nmass balances for the compounds indicate that 64% of the nonylphenol compounds\nand 86% of the octylphenols passed through treatment to the final effluent and that\nthere was a significant change in the distribution of oligomers due to cleavage of\nethoxy units and carboxylation through biological treatment.\nPlease insert Fig. 1.\nPlease insert Table 2.\n4. Discussion\n4.1. Optimization of the conditions for LC\/MS\/MS\nThe APEO exhibit a high affinity for alkali metal ions resulting in the formation of\nsodium adducts [M + Na]+ rather than the protonated molecules in unmodified mobile\nphases (Di Corcia et al., 2000; Jonkers et al., 2001; Petrovic and Barcelo, 2001b; Koh\net al., 2005). However, the sodium adducts tend to be stable and do not fragment in\nthe collision cell, and ammonium adducts have frequently been used (Takino et al.,\n82000; Cohen et al., 2001; Houde et al., 2002; Jonkers et al., 2003; Loos et al., 2007).\nIn this study, the use of ammonium adducts for MRM detection enhanced detection\nlimits due to high fragmentation in the collision cell.\nIdentification of the compounds was ensured by monitoring two characteristic\nprecursor-product ion transitions and obtaining an exact retention time match. For\nquantification, the most sensitive transition was used. However, some compounds\nproduced only one sensitive product ion (refer to Table 1). The characterization and\nquantification of APEO mixtures in environmental matrices is a challenge because of\nthe complexity of the mixtures available, there are no individual standards\ncommercially available. Quantitative results for individual APEO were interpreted\nwith caution because of the variations in the oligomer distributions. Peak integration\nwas performed automatically using MassLynx 4.1 (Micromass). Quantification using\nexternal calibration with standard solution mixtures was used. Calibration standards\nobtained through linear regression was r2 = 0.99 for AP, APEO and APEC. The\ninstrument variability of the LC\/MS\/MS is usually <5%.\n4.2 Evaluation of method performance\nMethod detection limit (MDL) was determined by subjecting the entire analytical\nextraction and detection procedure to the determination of spiked reagent water,\nsettled sewage and final effluent samples in both aqueous and adsorbed phases. The\nMDL determined for the entire SPE\/LC\/MS\/MS ranged from 1.2 to 9.6 ng l-1 for AP,\nAPEO and APEC (Table 1). The MDL ranged from 0.1 \u2013 4 ng l-1 for long chain\nAPEO (Table 1). The comparison of MDL is restricted because of the different\nsample matrices, the spectrum of analytes and the reported information on LODs and\nhow they were derived. In comparison to methods that allow the determination of\nselected APEO, APEC and AP in aqueous samples, MDLs of the presented\nLC\/MS\/MS method for individual analytes are mostly lower and in some cases in the\nsame range as in other studies (Table 3). Method detection limit (MDL) was also\ndetermined for adsorbed phase samples in ~0.2 g TSS samples. The MDL determined\nfor the entire SPE\/LC\/MS\/MS ranged from 6 to 60 ng g-1 for AP, short chain APEO\nand APEC. The MDL ranged from 0.5 \u2013 20 ng g-1 for long chain APEO.\nPlease insert Table 3.\n4.3 Mass balance and removal of alkylphenolic compounds\n9The difference in concentrations between the NPEC and OPEC observed in this study\nis in agreement with previous studies in which NPnEC dominated at 64% of the total\nin relation to the OPnEC (Ahel et al., 1994b). The major biotransformation product of\nthe NPEO, NP1-3EC, formed during the wastewater treatment, were present in the\nfinal effluent at relatively high concentrations (35 \u2013 1797 ng l-1) as a result of\nbiodegradation of higher-chain APEO. As demonstrated in this study progressive\nshortening of the ethoxylate chain occurs during the biological stage of wastewater\ntreatment, although this is not efficient enough to remove all of the higher oligomers\n(AP4-12EO) which were still observed in the final effluent. The presence of anaerobic\nzones within the stratified layers of trickling filters, may also contribute to the\nformation of parent alkylphenols. Under anaerobic conditions the alkylphenols are\nthought to be the final degradation products (Montgomery-Brown and Reinhard, 2003)\nand it is possible that the flux of these compounds, which may be adsorbed in the\nhumus sludge, could account for the mass balance at the works. The final effluent\nconcentration of nonylphenol found at this plant would meet the PNEC value set by\nthe UK Environment Agency (330 ng l\u20131), although it would fail for octylphenol (6 ng\nl\u20131).\n4.5 Comparison with other countries\nFew studies have reported on the fate and behaviour of APEO during trickling filter\ntreatment. However, two studies indicated removal of APEO (68 \u2013 77%) from a\ndomestic trickling filter works STW (Brown et al., 1987; Gerike, 1987). This efficient\nremoval capacity was attributed to its high removal of COD which was comparable to\nthat for an activated sludge process. This study corroborated with the findings of\nGerike, 1987 in that APEO do degrade, however, estrogenic carboxylated metabolites\nare generated in the process. The concentrations of APEO and their degradation\nproducts reported here are slightly lower or within the concentration ranges reported\nfor the same analytes in STW effluents of other countries (Ying et al., 2002).\n5. Conclusions\nAn analytical method for alkylphenolic compounds has been developed, consisting of\na SPE extraction (dissolved phase); and solvent extraction with silica clean-up\n(adsorbed phase) followed by LC\/MS\/MS detection. The use of a triple quadrupole\ninstrument in the MRM mode demonstrated high selectivity and sensitivity. The MDL\ndetermined for the entire method ranged from 1.2 to 9.6 ng l-1 for AP, AP1-3EO and\nAPEC and 0.1 \u2013 4.1 ng l-1 for AP4-12EO. The results demonstrate the importance of\n10\ndetermining not only the alkylphenols and ethoxylates, but also the APEC\nintermediates, as the highest concentrations found in the final effluent were for\nNP1EC and NP2EC (476 and 1797 ng l-1 respectively). Concentrations of NP (28 ng l-1\nin dissolved phase sample) were not found above the predicted no-effect\nconcentration (PNEC) of 0.33 \u00b5g l-1, although this study demonstrated that in\ncomparison to the activated sludge process, trickling filters are inefficient at removal\nof these compounds.\nAcknowledgements\nOne of the authors (Y.K.K.
