We show by computational simulation that the\nfield enhancement factor b is only dependant on the emitter height h, radius r, when the anode to\ncathode separation D is greater than three times the height of the emitter away from the tip. In this\nregime the enhancement factor is independent of the anode location and approaches a value depicted\nby h and r alone and is described by the expression b0= s1+\u02dbh \/ardm where a=2 and m=1. As the\nanode is brought close to the tip of the emitter, the emitter tip and anode approximate a parallel plate\nconfiguration and the enhancement factor tends to unity.

For a single, isolated CNT, the value\nof enhancement factor is believed to be dependant on the\nlength, radius, and type of structure, i.e., multiwalled\nsMWNTd, singlewalled sSWNTd, open or closed cap: This\nhas been subject to several computational and experimental\ninvestigations.3\u20138 Geometric enhancement is not just appli-\ncable to CNT but also exists in a number of other tip-based\nstructures including: SiC nanowires,9 MoO3 nanobelts,10\ntungsten nanowires,11 spindt tips,12 and copper sulphide\nnanowire arrays.13 Much of the analysis performed on ex-\nperimental data has relied upon analysis of the emission cur-\nrent I to field E sor voltage Vd characteristics using the well-\nknown field emission mechanism of Fowler and Nordheim.14\nThe standard analysis often involves a plot of the logsI \/E2d\nversus 1\/E sor equally log I \/V2 against 1 \/Vd and from the\nslope of the graph an approximate value for the field en-\nhancement factor b can be extracted. The role of b is the\nenhancement of the applied macroscopic electric field such\nthat under the action of the local electric field, tunneling of\nelectrons from the Fermi level, into the vacuum, through the\npotential barrier becomes possible. The interpretation of b,\nwhich is a dimensionless quantity if electric field rather than\nvoltage is used in the analysis, is therefore of great impor-\ntance.\nThere have been a number of attempts to model the be-\nhaviour of b for a range of nanotube height and radius.

Mayer and colleagues16 have used a transfer matrix\ntechnique to compare the field emission behavior between\nmetallic single-walled nanotubes sSWNTd and a multiwalled\nnanotube sMWNTd composed of the three single-walled\ntubes. They observed that the emission from the MWNT is\nlarger than the total current obtained from consideration of\nthe individual walls separately. They also noted that the\nemission was improved when the end of the tubes were con-\nvex rather than flattop.16 They further showed that the emis-\nsion behavior of bundles of open and closed tubes were de-\npendent on two factors; whether the tubes were open or\nclosed and the role of proximity field screening by neighbor-\ning tubes.16 Closed tubes are found to emit less current than\nopen tubes and that their field emission sFEd characteristics\nare found to be more sensitive to the local electric field.\nTheoretical investigations of field screening due to neighbor-\ning tubes are important in explaining the FE characteristics\nsuch as threshold field and emission site density.

Accurate\ncalculations of electrostatic problems can be performed on a\nwide range of aspect ratios sheight over radiusd of emitters.\nIn this article, electrostatic simulations of isolated emitters\nare reported.

We further explore the effects of the location\nof the anode electrode to emission characteristics.\nSimulations of metallic emitters, to ensure no field pen-\netration, of varying aspect ratio sheight over radiusd were\ncarried out to investigate their field emission, and more par-\nticularly their field enhancement properties. The emitter con-\nsists of a hemispherical cap of radius r on top of a cylindrical\nshank with total shank and cap height \u201ch.\u201d They were placed\nin a vacuum and on a grounded cathode electrode so that the\nsurface area of the emitter and the cathode has an equipoten-\ntial value of 0 V. An anode electrode was suspended above\nthe emitter tip at a distance D away. The commercially avail-\nable SILVACO\u2122 package18,19 was employed to carry out the\nsimulations, in two dimensions, and due to the simulation\npackage, the work area or width of the simulation setup, was\nkept at 32 \u00b5m to ensure no field screening due to edge ef-\nfects. A mesh sor gridd is automatically determined by the\nsoftware over the structure, where intersections between the\nx and y axes of the mesh determines a calculation point. The\ndensity of intersection points were then manually increased\naround the emitter tip to allow the local electric field Elocal to\nbe accurately extracted. A mesh line spacing of 0.5 nm was\nused at and around the tip. To ensure the accuracy of the\nextracted electric field we simulated the electric field en-\nhancement of a hemisphere and also mathematically calcu-\nlated the enhancement for comparison. The field enhance-\nment factor of a hemisphere in two dimensions was found by\nsolving a Laplace equation, a value of 2 was calculated. A 2\n\u00b5m radius hemisphere on a grounded plane in a vacuum with\na planar anode was simulated and both applied and local\nelectric field were extracted by the simulator. A field en-\nhancement factor of 2.0 was found confirming the accuracy\nof our setup. Figure 1sad is a schematic of the simulation\nsetup. Current-voltage sI\u2013Vd measurements were carried out\non an emitter of height 2, 4 and 6 \u00b5m and radius 200 nm with\nan applied electric field of 0\u2013100 Vmm\u22121 to ensure sufficient\nelectron emission from a single tip. Simulations were carried\nout at an anode to tip separation D\u2212h, of 0.1 \u00b5m above the\ntip with emission current and local electric field recorded,\nuntil emission was no longer noticed. Figure 1sbd shows the\nthreshold field ET for the three emitters of heights 2, 4, and 6\n\u00b5m and constant radius 200 nm. It is clear that ET is highest\nat low D, decreasing and saturating at high D. In this case,\nall properties of the emitter simulations were kept identical;\nthe only aspect that was varied was D. To investigate further\nwe extracted the electric field enhancement factor b for a\nrange of D.\nEnhancement factor against D is shown for an emitter of\nradius 100 nm and heights of 2, 4, and 6 \u00b5m shown in Fig.\n2sad and radius 50 nm and heights 2, 4, and 6 \u00b5m in Fig.\n2sbd. A range of D from 0.1 \u00b5m above the tip of the emitter,\nto 500 \u00b5m are shown. It is appropriate to say at this point that\nwhile enhancement factor is usually defined as the local field\nover the applied field, where the applied field is usually taken\nas the applied voltage over anode to cathode separation D or\nJVST B - Microelectronics and Nanometer Structuresb =\nElocal\ns VDd\n. s2d\nWe feel that as the anode electrode approaches the tip of the\nemitter, the tip and anode approximates to a parallel plate\nconfiguration, as often assumed in probe-based field emis-\nsion testing systems.

It is seen in Figs. 2sad and\n2sbd that b1 for all emitters is lowest at low D, increasing and\nsaturating as D increases. The point of saturation occurs at\napproximately 3h. For all emitters it is seen that b1 ap-\nproaches 1 as the anode approaches the tip. This ties in with\nthe high ET seen in Fig. 1sbd and also the assumption that the\nsystem approximates to a parallel plate configuration. Simi-\nlar trends of threshold field and enhancement factor of tip-\nbased emitters were seen in experimental results of single-\nwalled nanotubes by Bonard et al.20 They initially showed in\na plot of current density against macroscopic field that as the\nanode electrode is close to the emitters, the threshold field is\nhigher than that when the anode is sufficiently far away.\nTheir results tie in with our simulated results of Fig. 1sbd.\nThey further went to extract a field enhancement factor for\nthe sample and showed that it increases and saturates with an\nincreasing interelectrode distance, which ties in with our\nsimulated results of Figs. 2sad and 2sbd. It is also important to\nFIG. 2. sad Enhancement factor b1 trend with increasing D for three emitters\nof constant radius 100 nm and heights of 2 sjd, 4 ssd, and 6 smd \u00b5m. sbd.\nEnhancement factor trend with increasing D for three emitters of constant\nradius 50 nm and heights of 2 sjd, 4 ssd, and 6 smd \u00b5m.

B, Vol. 23, No. 2, Mar\/Apr 2005a function of D ,h, and r, but at high D ,b1 is a function of h\nand r alone. These values at high D are investigated in Fig. 3.\nAspect ratios of 1 to 500 were simulated, and b0 extracted.\nBased on an analytical model for an ellipsoid cylinder,\nKosmahl21 derived an expression for the two-dimensional\nenhancement factor given by\nb0 = s1 + \u02dbh\/rcdm, s5d\nwhere h is the height of the protrusion, rc is the radius of\ncurvature given by h2 \/r, and m=1. The fit to data from the\nsimulation for a power law dependence based on Eq. s5d and\nrc5radius of the curvature taken gives a slope m=0.94. Al-\nthough the geometry of the spheroid is different from that of\na cylindrical shaft capped with a hemisphere, the excellent fit\nbetween the simulated data and Eq. s5d strongly indicates\nthat the functional form of Eq. s5d is able to describe the data\nobtained in this study. An alternative equation with a similar\nfunctional form is given in Eq. s6d below\nb0 = s1 + \u02dbh\/ardm. s6d\nIn this case a value of m=1 is obtained with a=2.0. It is not\nclear whether there is any significance that can be attached to\na value of a=2 at present. The values of b0 for the range of\naspect ratios of 1\u2013500 are plotted in the form of b0 versus\nf1+ sh \/ard0.5g and shown in Fig. 3. This function is em-\nployed to ensure a gradient of 1, therefore linking the equa-\ntion to simulated values for values of enhancement factor\nwhen the anode electrode is sufficiently far away from the\nprotrusion. Using the simulated emitters of Fig. 2sad of\nheight 2, 4, and 6 \u00b5m with radius 100 nm a limiting enhance-\nment factor of 4.16, 5.47, and 6.48, respectively, were found\nusing Eq. s6d, and for Fig. 2sbd emitters of height 2, 4, and 6\n\u00b5m with radius 50 nm give a limiting enhancement factor of\n5.47, 7.32, and 8.74, respectively. This asymptotic expres-\nsion can be seen as the dotted lines to Figs. 2sad and 2sbd;\nthese values for the individual emitters are the limiting val-\nues of enhancement factor when the anode plane is suffi-\nciently far from the emitter tip, and is depicted by the emitter\nFIG. 3. b0 against 1+ sh \/ard0.5.

It is only when the anode is\ngreater than three times the height of the emitter that its true\npotential as an emitter becomes possible. At low D, the emit-\nters approximate to a parallel plate configuration and there-\nfore lose their usually high enhancement factor. It has been\nshown that careful consideration as to the location of an elec-\ntrode above the emitter has to be employed.\nThe authors would like to thank the EPSRC Portfolio\nPartnership and Carbon Based Electronics programs for\nfunding this research.\n1S.
