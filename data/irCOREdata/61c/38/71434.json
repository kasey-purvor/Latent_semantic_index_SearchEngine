Recently, however, real-world studies indicate that \nexperts frequently and spontaneously use analogies in domain-based problem \nsolving. There is also some evidence that in certain circumstances domain \nnovices can draw analogies designed to illustrate arguments. It is less clear, \nhowever, whether domain novices can invoke analogies in the sophisticated \nmanner of experts to enable them to progress problem solving. In the current \nstudy groups of novices and experts tackled large-scale management \nproblems. Spontaneous analogising was observed in both conditions, with no \nmarked differences between expertise levels in the frequency, structure or \nfunction of analogising. On average four analogies were generated by groups \nper hour, with significantly more relational mappings between analogue and \ntarget being produced than superficial object-and-attribute mappings. \nAnalogising served two different purposes: problem solving (dominated by \nrelational mappings), and illustration (which for novices was dominated by \nobject-and-attribute mappings). Overall, our novices showed a sophistication \nin domain-based analogical reasoning that is usually only observed with \nexperts, in addition to a sensitivity to the pragmatics of analogy use. \n \n \nBearman                                                                   The Structure and Function  \n 3 \nThe Structure and Function of Spontaneous Analogising in Domain-Based \nProblem Solving \nTheorists have traditionally viewed analogical reasoning as a core \nelement of intelligent thought (Raven, 1938; Sternberg, 1977), and recent \nevidence suggests that it may play a central role in the retrieval of information \nfrom long-term memory (e.g., Schank, 1999), in domain-based skill \nacquisition (Anderson, 1983), and in creative problem solving (e.g., Holyoak \n& Thagard, 1995). It is this latter area of activity that forms the focus of the \npresent research. In problem-solving contexts analogical reasoning is typically \nviewed as entailing the use of \u201cbase\u201d information from a previous problem-\nsolving episode to facilitate attempts at solving a current \u201ctarget\u201d problem. It \nis noteworthy, however, that the postulated importance of analogising in \nproblem solving stands in sharp contrast to many findings concerning the \nnature and extent of analogical problem solving in laboratory studies. For \nexample, pioneering experiments by Gick and Holyoak (1980, 1983) \ndemonstrated that providing participants with a base analogue prior to them \ntackling a superficially different but conceptually similar target promoted only \na modest increase in solution rates (i.e., to levels of 20-30%) relative to a \ncontrol condition where no analogue had been presented. It was only in \nconditions where explicit hints were provided about the relevance of the base \ninformation to the target problem that high levels of facilitated performance \narose (see also Anoli, Antonietti, Crisafulli, & Cantoia, 2001). \nOther studies have clarified that the transfer of an analogous solution \nin the absence of directive hints is also not greatly elevated by manipulations \nBearman                                                                   The Structure and Function  \n 4 \nsuch as: (a) giving participants a static diagrammatic representation of the \nunderlying solution-structure associated with the base problem (e.g., Gick & \nHolyoak, 1983; Pedone, Hummel, & Holyoak, 2001); (b) providing problem \nsolvers with an abstract verbal statement summarising the underlying \nconceptual nature of the base problem and its solution (e.g., Gick & Holyoak, \n1983); or (c) re-presenting the base information to the participant whilst they \nare processing the target (Anoli et al., 2001; Gick & Holyoak, 1980). Taken \ntogether, this evidence appears to support the contention that whilst people \nmay be good at utilising prior problem and solution information when they are \ndirected to do so, they may be rather limited in their capacity to detect such \nanalogous information in the first place. \nEvidence for Spontaneous Analogising \nSome studies, however, have produced more striking evidence for the \nspontaneous use of analogies by problem solvers. For example, Pedone et al. \n(2001, Experiments 3 and 4) demonstrated the effectiveness of animated \ndisplays of base analogues for spontaneous transfer. In addition, Holyoak and \nKoh (1987) and Keane (1987) have shown that people do notice and apply \nprior analogues when there are high levels of surface similarity in the \ninformation content of the base and target, in addition to underlying \nconceptual similarity. This latter situation arguably relates more closely to \nmuch real-world problem solving, where \u201cwithin-domain\u201d analogies involving \nclose variants of a target problem are likely to be available. For example, Ball, \nOrmerod, and Morley (2004) illustrate the role of within-domain analogising \nin professional design practice with reference to an industrial designer who, \nBearman                                                                   The Structure and Function  \n 5 \nwhen tackling an information-display problem, was readily able to bring to \nmind previous design experience relating to other displays that he had worked \non in the past.  \nAt a theoretical level, Sweller (1980) has argued that much of the time \nthere is, in fact, a strong correlation between the surface features of problems \nand their underlying abstract solution structures. Therefore, relying on surface \nfeatures to access what might be a relevant base problem may be a valuable \nheuristic (cf. Blessing & Ross, 1996), and one that the human cognitive \nsystem may well have evolved to operate. As a heuristic, however, it is likely \nto be far from foolproof, and may, on occasions, lead to attempts to map \nbetween base and target problems that, whilst appearing to be superficially \nsimilar at a surface level, in fact have no underlying conceptual association in \nterms of solution structures (e.g., see Novick, 1988, for relevant evidence). \nApart from the role of surface similarity in driving spontaneous \nanalogical reasoning, other research has provided evidence for unprompted \nanalogising when multiple analogues are presented prior to the target problem \n-- even when such analogues share few surface similarities to the target (see \nGick & Holyoak, 1983; Catrombone, & Holyoak, 1989). This line of research \nis particularly interesting as it suggests that a primary mechanism \nunderpinning the development of domain-based expertise may well be \nanalogical reasoning. The essential claim of theorists taking this position (e.g., \nAnderson, 1983; Blessing & Ross, 1996; Gick & Holyoak, 1983; Schank, \n1999) is that repeated exposure to within-domain problems serves to promote \nthe induction of generalised knowledge schemas. Such schemas embody an \nBearman                                                                   The Structure and Function  \n 6 \nabstract conceptual understanding of the underlying structure of problems, and \nserve to enable the recognition of problem \u201ctypes\u201d; they also embody a \nprocedural understanding of how best to solve problems of that particular \ntype. \n Analogical Problem Solving in Real-World Contexts \nRecently, spontaneous analogical problem solving has started to be \ninvestigated in applied contexts. This research has particularly focused on the \nbehaviour of experts. For example, Marchant, Robinson, Anderson, and \nSchadewald (1993) investigated the use of analogies in the interpretation of \ntax statutes in graduate students and professional lawyers. They found that \nboth groups demonstrated high rates of transfer from domain-based structural \nanalogues. Likewise, Clement (1988) found that science experts frequently \nevoked analogies when attempting to explain a concept. Most recently, \nDunbar and colleagues (e.g., Dunbar, 2001; Dunbar & Blanchette, 2001) have \ndocumented the use of analogy by immunologists and molecular biologists, \nfinding that structural analogising was prevalent in a range of scientific \nactivities, such as formulating hypotheses, designing and modifying \nexperiments, and giving explanations to other scientists. Dunbar (2001) was \nalso able to determine the function of the analogies in his observations. When \nisolated, unexpected results occurred the scientists drew analogies to similar \nexperiments, what Dunbar (2001) calls \u201clocal\u201d analogies. However, when a \nseries of unexpected results occurred the scientists drew more distant \nanalogies to the function of similar components in other organisms. Thus the \nBearman                                                                   The Structure and Function  \n 7 \ntype of analogical mapping appears to differ depending on the purpose for \nwhich it is drawn.  \n In sum, it appears that experts in applied settings are able \nspontaneously to draw analogies between base and target problems. This is \nconsistent with the widely held view that key differences between experts and \nnovices reflect different levels of information encoding. Experts are able to \nencode information at a deeper, structural level, whilst novices generally \nencode information at a more surface or superficial level (Chi, Feltovich, & \nGlaser, 1981; Klein, 1999; Novick, 1988). In this way, experts solving \ndomain-based problems are able to exploit the underlying relational structure \nof information much better than novices, who generally rely more on the \nsuperficial features of problem situations (Chi et al., 1981; Klein, 1998; \nNovick, 1988). This account of expert problem solving is also consistent with \nthe findings of Thompson, Gentner, and Loewenstein (2000), who observed \nthat unless management students were actively encouraged to compare base \nanalogues in order to draw out their structural relations, their rate of transfer \nof an underlying concept remained low.  \n In contrast to Thompson et al.\u2019s (2000) findings, however, there is \nsome evidence that novices, like experts, can readily make use of structural \nanalogies without being directly encouraged to create such structural \nmappings. For example, Blanchette and Dunbar (2000) asked novices to \nengage in political analysis and generate base analogues to explain a target \nconcept to others. It was found that these novices were readily able to draw \nBearman                                                                   The Structure and Function  \n 8 \nstructural inferences from the target domain to semantically distant source \ndomains that also possessed little superficial similarity to the target problem. \n Overall, then, the extent to which domain novices are able to draw on \nanalogies when tackling problems remains unclear, with the few existing \nstudies showing some inconsistent findings that may well relate to \nmethodological aspects of the research \u2013 a point that is argued persuasively  \nby Blanchette & Dunbar, 2000. For example, their own study that reveals \ngood levels of structural analogising in novices adopts what they refer to as a \nproduction paradigm, whereby participants are given a target problem and \nasked to generate a source analogue. This contrasts with the lower levels of \nnovice analogising in Thompson et al.\u2019s (2000) study and most traditional \nlaboratory-based research, which adopt what they term a reception paradigm, \nwhereby participants have to detect a relation between source and target \nproblems that are presented.  \n Our present study, then, was designed as an attempt to address further \nthe issue of spontaneous analogising in real-world novice and expert problem \nsolving. Our chosen domain was management science, which allows \npractitioners to draw widely on multiple sources of stored knowledge to affect \nsolutions to problems. Our study investigated both management novices \n(undergraduates) and management experts (postdoctoral academics) \nconducting group-based analyses of a presented \u201cbusiness case\u201d (Easton, \n1992). Participants worked in teams and were required to specify the problems \nand opportunities inherent in the case, and to produce a set of solutions that \nmight optimise the success of the business described in the case. The task may \nBearman                                                                   The Structure and Function  \n 9 \nbe described as ill-defined (Van Lehn, 1989) and, in some respects, undefined, \nas multiple solution possibilities exist, and there is no objective metric for \njudging attainment of an optimal solution.  \n Our study involved comparisons between the frequency and \nstructural complexity of analogising in expert and novice management \npractitioners. In light of observations concerning the differing functions of \nanalogies in real-world situations, we were also alert to the possibility that \nmanagement contexts might similarly be associated with analogy use aimed at \nattaining different practical goals. To achieve our aims, analogies first needed \nto be identified in the transcribed discussions of collaborating participants, and \nthen had to be categorised using a pre-defined coding scheme. The \nidentification of analogies was based on a technique developed by Clement \n(1988), and will be considered in more detail in the method section below. \nThe coding of analogies derived from a scheme developed by Gentner (1983) \nfor classifying the syntactic elements of information that are mapped between \nbase and target domains (see also Falkenhainer, Forbus, & Gentner, 1989), \nand is described below. \nThe Structure of Analogies \n Like Gentner, we also view domains as being systems of objects, \nobject-attributes and relations between objects. As such, domain knowledge \ncan be understood as comprising propositional networks of nodes and \npredicates (e.g., Rumelhart & Ortony, 1977; Schank & Abelson, 1977), where \nnodes represent concepts, and where predicates are applied to nodes to express \npropositions about concepts. One critical syntactic distinction among predicate \nBearman                                                                   The Structure and Function  \n 10 \ntypes advanced by Gentner (1983) is that between object-attributes versus \nrelations. This distinction can readily be made explicit in the predicate \nstructure. Thus object-attributes are simply predicates that take on a single \nargument of the form, PREDICATE (argument1), as in the following example \nthat describes the colour of an object or entity1: BROWN (Hercules-the-dog). \nIn contrast, relations are predicates that take on two or more arguments of the \nform PREDICATE (argument1, argument 2\u2026argumentn), as in the following \nexample: CHASE (Hercules-the-dog, Fifi-the-dog).  \nUnder this distinction between attributes and relations, base-to-target \nmappings could arise at: (a) just the level of attributes and associated objects; \n(b) just the level of relations; or (c) a mix of both levels. Gentner (1983), \nhowever, argues that type-a and type-c mappings are best viewed as being \nmere appearance matches and literal similarities, respectively, rather than \nexamples of \u201cpure\u201d analogies (see also Gentner & Markman, 1997). She \nreserves the term \u201canalogy\u201d for situations where there are few or no object-\nand-attribute mappings between base and target domains relative to many \nrelational mappings, as in type-b. Our own research on spontaneous \nanalogising in real-world practice (Ball et al., 2004; Bearman, 2004) suggests \nthat few cases of analogising reach the status of being exclusively relational in \nnature. Thus our coding scheme simply aimed to dichotomise instances of \nanalogising that were either purely object-and-attribute level mappings (i.e., \nmere appearance matches) versus those that involved relational mappings \n(irrespective of whether or not object-and-attribute mappings were also \noccurring). Henceforth we refer to the former category of analogising as \nBearman                                                                   The Structure and Function  \n 11 \nobject-and-attribute analogies, and the second category as relational \nanalogies. \nA second syntactic distinction advanced by Gentner (1983) is that \nbetween first-order predicates (that take objects as arguments) and higher-\norder predicates (that take propositions as arguments). For example, CHASE \n(Hercules-the-dog, Fifi-the-dog) and RUN-AWAY-FROM (Fifi-the-dog, \nFifi\u2019s-owner) are both first-order predicates, whereas CAUSE [CHASE \n(Hercules-the-dog, Fifi-the-dog), RUNS-AWAY-FROM (Fifi-the-dog, Fifi\u2019s-\nowner)] is a second-order predicate2. It is clear that the order of a mapping has \na very close association to the level of the entities that are mapped (as \ndescribed previously) with the pure object-and-attribute mappings discussed \nabove being lower-order predicate mappings in contrast to mappings of \nrelations and systems of relations, which encompass higher-order predicate \nmappings. This observation allowed us to finesse the distinction between \nmapping level and mapping order for the purpose of our primary analysis of \nanalogy structure. Thus, we simply utilised the single coding scheme already \ndescribed (i.e., identifying object-and-attribute analogies vs. relational \nanalogies) in order to capture salient aspects of the structure of analogising \narising in the problem solving of our novice and expert participants. The fact \nthat our relational category encompassed both first-order predicate mappings \nas well as higher-order predicate mappings seems warranted on theoretical \ngrounds, given that such analogies are clearly distinct in a syntactically \nsignificant way from pure object-and-attribute analogies that simply reflect \nmere appearance matches in Gentner\u2019s (1983) terminology. \nBearman                                                                   The Structure and Function  \n 12 \nThe Function of the Analogies \nThe structure-oriented coding scheme that we have just outlined was \nunable to address issues relating to the purpose or goal for which analogies \nmight be drawn in our study. The pragmatic analysis of analogical transfer \nwas pioneered by Holyoak (1985), and since this time pragmatics have been \nfound to constrain how ambiguity is resolved (e.g., Spellman & Holyoak, \n1996) and to influence the semantic distance between base and target domains \n(e.g., Dunbar, 2001; Richland, Holyoak, & Stigler, 2004). It may well be, \nthen, that the reason why the novices and experts draw analogies will \ninfluence the form that the analogy takes, and we were alert to this issue in the \npresent study. \nTo capture the function of analogies it our research it was necessary to \nuse a second method of coding that was able to discriminate such nuances in \nanalogy use. Since it was considered desirable to allow the functional aspects \nof analogies to emerge from the data rather than to pre-judge the issue, a \nqualitative assessment of expert and novice analogising was performed on the \ndata in the form of a thematic analysis. Thematic analysis is a method of \nclassifying segments of discourse that involves sorting such extracts on the \nbasis of perceived similarities (Plummer, 1995; Smith, 1995). \nMethod  \nParticipants \n \nSixty-four participants took part in the study. Thirty-two participants \nwere undergraduates (23 female; 9 male), and are henceforth referred to as \nnovices. Thirty-two participants were postdoctoral academics employed in \nBearman                                                                   The Structure and Function  \n 13 \nmanagement science at various universities around the world (11 females; 21 \nmale), and are henceforth described as experts. Participants were not paid.  The \nnovices were analysing cases of business situations as part of their course \nrequirements for a final-year marketing module within their management \nscience degree course. We acknowledge that our novices were not totally \nna\u00efve to the area of business management as they possessed some relevant \ndomain knowledge. Still, they were very inexperienced in tackling business-\ncase problems, and the relevant knowledge that they did posses was mainly in \nthe form of analytical concepts such as the use of SWOT analysis for \nconsidering a company\u2019s current position. The experts we studied were \nanalysing cases as a part of workshops that they were involved in on the theme \nof \u201cTeaching with Cases\u201d. These experts were all post-doctoral academics \nemployed in management schools within universities, and thus had a wealth of \nadvanced domain knowledge. Several of had been practicing management for \nmore than ten years, and thus surpassed the threshold that some researchers \nhave claimed as a criterion for true expertise, though most fell short of this \nten-year threshold by a few years. All of our participants, whether novices or \nexperts, worked in collaborating groups during their case analyses. \nMaterials \nThere were eight novice groups that each involved four participants. \nFour cases were distributed equally amongst these eight novice groups (i.e., \neach case was initially analysed by two different groups). Groups 1 and 2 \nanalysed \u201cBallygowan Springs into New Age Kisqua\u201d (Cullen, 1996), Groups \n3 and 4 analysed \u201cThe Champagne Industry in 1993\u201d (Cool, Howe, & \nBearman                                                                   The Structure and Function  \n 14 \nHenderson, 1998), Groups 5 and 6 analysed \u201cPetrol Retailing in Europe: The \nUK Market\u201d (Lew, 1999), and Group 7 and 8 analysed \u201cDelta Dairy S.A\u201d. \n(Easton & Dritsas, 1992). The cases were 9 pages, 19 pages, 13 pages and 11 \npages long, respectively. \nThe expert component of the study involved two sets of experts, those \nwho were attending the Copenhagen workshop and those who were attending \nthe Cranfield workshop. The Cranfield experts analysed two cases, \n\u201cHolmesafe Ltd\u201d (Andrews, 2000) and \u201cEast Midlands Bus and Coach \nServices Ltd\u201d (Williamson, 2000), and the Copenhagen experts analysed three \ncases, \u201cGraham Stewart: General Manager, A, B and C\u201d (Erskine & Simons, \n2002), \u201cThe Purchasing Co-Op\u201d (Menor, Erskine, & Leenders, 2000), and \n\u201cJim Olson\u201d (Leenders, 2000). All experts worked in small groups of three to \nfive people during their initial analyses of these cases. \nProcedure \nThe case-analysis sessions were conducted with novices at Lancaster \nUniversity, UK, and with experts during two workshops held by the European \nCase Clearing House. One workshop took place at Cranfield University, UK \nand the other in the Copenhagen Business School, Denmark. These workshops \nwere attended by participants from higher education establishments around the \nworld and were conducted in English.   \nCases were distributed to the participants before the analysis sessions \nso that they were familiar with the material before discussing it. Participants \nanalysed the cases in two different settings: initial, small group discussions \nwhich lasted between 30 min and 2 hr, and subsequent large group discussions \nBearman                                                                   The Structure and Function  \n 15 \nwhich lasted for approximately 1 hr (with the exception that two expert \nanalyses involved only large group discussions). The large group discussions \nwere chaired by a case leader, who kept order, wrote down points and invited \ncontributions. Small groups were self-directed by the group members. The \nsmall group discussions allowed the participants a chance to discuss the cases \nin order to prepare for the large group discussion. The novices were allocated \ninto collaborating groups of four on the basis of who the module director \nbelieved would work well together and the experts worked in self-determined \ngroups of three to five individuals. \nThe aim of the case analyses was for groups to design a package of \nrecommendations that could be implemented by one of the organisations \ndescribed within the case.3 The recommendations consisted of the group\u2019s \nanalysis of the organisation\u2019s problems and their solutions to those problems. \nAt the beginning of the analysis sessions the experimenter introduced himself \nand requested permission to audio-tape the sessions. During the case-analysis \nsessions the experimenter was a passive observer who sat quietly making \nnotes. An audio recording was made of the small and large group discussions. \nAnalogy Extraction and Coding \nAnalogy extraction. Clement (1988) proposed four desirable attributes \nof a definition for recognising spontaneous analogies in participants\u2019 problem-\nsolving discourse: (1) inclusion of attempts to produce episodes that are \nsimilar to, but different from, the target problem situation; (2) inclusion of \nsuch attempts, whether or not they ultimately yield an answer to the problem; \n(3) separation of analogy generation from \u201cother\u201d problem-solving processes; \nBearman                                                                   The Structure and Function  \n 16 \nand (4) ruling-out of trivial cases that involve only surface similarity (i.e., \nmere-appearance matches) without relational similarity. \n Following Clement\u2019s (1988) first three principles we likewise defined \nan analogical episode as having occurred when a participant drew a \ncomparison between the existing situation and a previous situation, and it \ncould be seen that some aspects of the two situations were equivalent. We \ndiscounted analogies that: (a) were based on lectures or course materials, (b) \nwere drawn by the Case Leader, or (c) were repetitions of previous analogies \n(except where the repetition was drawn to solve a different problem, or the \nfunction of the analogy changed; in these rare cases the analogies were \ncounted as two distinct analogical episodes). Unlike Clement (1988), mere-\nappearance matches in the absence of any relational similarity were included \nin our analogy-extraction process, as we believed that analogies arising at this \nlevel could engender important insights about expert\/novice differences in \ndomain-based problem solving. Indeed, mere-appearance matches may well \ninvolve quite rich, and potentially useful, cross-domain correspondences that \ncould progress problem solving. Such mappings, therefore, seem worthy of \nanalysis. \n Full analogy extraction was conducted by the first author, and a 15% \nrandom sample of the data was then analysed by an independent researcher. \nThere was 95% agreement between the initial and subsequent analogy \nextraction in this reliability analysis, and disagreements that occurred showed \nno discernable pattern. \nBearman                                                                   The Structure and Function  \n 17 \nCoding of analogy structure. Table 1 shows an analogy that was \nproduced by a novice during a tutorial, and will serve as the basis of the \nfollowing exemplification of our coding system. The verbal extract in Table 1 \nindicates that the participant was tackling the problem of how to achieve \nincreased revenue for a petrol-retail company by proposing the solution of \nselling advertising space close to the pumps. This was based on an analogy to \nwhat other petrol stations were doing. In our formulation of the propositional \nstructure of an extracted analogical episode it was necessary: (1) to reduce the \namount of information in the episode to its core, explicit, ideational and \nrelational constructs; and (2) to draw the minimal inferences necessary to \ncapture missing relational constructs that were sometimes omitted in the \nanalogical episode. Inferences to complete analogies were made infrequently, \nand only when they seemed logically warranted. In the extract in Table 1, for \nexample, it was not explicitly stated in the text that \u201ccompanies are selling \nadvertising space\u201d,  but this inference was a minimal necessary inference to \nlend coherence to the analogical episode, and also seemed entirely legitimate  \nin the context of the analogy, as giving the advertising space away for free \nwould conflict with the stated company aim of increasing revenue.  \n (Table 1 about here) \nOnce we had identified the propositional structure of an analogical \nepisode in the way that we have just outlined we were then able to apply our \ndichotomous coding scheme to note whether the analogy was either an \n\u201cobject-and-attribute mapping\u201d or a \u201crelational mapping\u201d. The analogical \nepisode in Table 1 presents an example of the mapping of a higher-order \nBearman                                                                   The Structure and Function  \n 18 \nrelation, in this case \u2018CAUSE\u2019, and therefore it is an example of a relational \nanalogy. Holyoak and Thagard (1995) identify a number of different potential \nhigher-order relationships, including CAUSE, EXPLAIN, IMPLY, ENTAIL, \nPRESUPPOSE, FACILITATE, HINDER and PREVENT, although CAUSE is \nargued by them to be the most common, and, indeed, it was predominant in \nour own coding of higher-order relations within analogical episodes. \nThe coding formalism used here is highly similar to the propositional \ncoding of analogies employed by Blanchette and Dunbar (2000) that involved \nvariables, relational terms and logical connectives (e.g., and, if\u2026then and \ntherefore). We present an example of Blanchette and Dunbar\u2019s (2000) coding \nin Table 2 in order to illustrate their analysis approach. Our analogy example \npresented in Table 1 could readily be reworked into Blanchette and Dunbar\u2019s \nscheme by rephrasing what we include as object names into variables. The \nexample would then read \u201cIf X sells Y, then this causes X to increase Z\u201d,  in \nother words \u201cIf a company sells advertising space near the petrol pumps, then \nthis causes the company to increase its revenue\u201d. Critically for our structure-\nbased analysis of analogies, both Blanchette and Dunbar\u2019s scheme and our \nown Gentner-based scheme would characterise this example analogy as \ninvolving a relational mapping.  \n(Table 2 about here) \nCoding of analogy function. In addition to coding analogies in terms of \ntheir structure, we also conducted a thematic analysis of analogies aimed at \nidentifying the purpose or function for which they were drawn. This thematic \nanalysis was undertaken on the original verbal extracts and was independent \nBearman                                                                   The Structure and Function  \n 19 \nof our coding of their structure. The way that we applied thematic analysis \nwas to sort all identified analogical extracts systematically into distinct \ncategories that reflected their identifiable, function-oriented similarities. We \nexplored different ways of sorting the analogical extracts based on different \nways in which their function could be viewed as similar. This was done until a \ncoherent scheme was produced that accounted for the data (i.e., there were no \nepisodes that remained uncategorized).   \nResults \n An attempt was made in this study to observe real-world analogical \nproblem solving in as natural a setting as possible, hence the reliance on \nethnographic methods and the use of participants who were analysing business \ncases for a purpose outside of the requirements of the study. The use of these \nkinds of participants precluded the exertion of rigid control over the study \nprocedures applied and the case-analysis problems examined across our \nexpertise manipulation. However, it should be noted that whilst subtle \ndiscrepancies in both procedures and tasks would make the interpretation of \nany differences in observed expert and novice behaviours quite difficult, such \ndiscrepancies in procedures and tasks would arguably make the finding of \nexpert\/novice similarities more robust, since such similarities would have \narisen despite procedural and task discrepancies. \nAnalogy Extraction \nThe expert groups produced 34 analogies in 6 hr of discussion, a mean \nrate of 5.6 analogies per hr (SD = 3.8, range = 0-12), whilst the novice groups \nproduced 48 analogies in 19 hr of discussion, a mean rate of 2.5 analogies per \nBearman                                                                   The Structure and Function  \n 20 \nhr (SD = 4.8, range = 0-20). In addition to these analogy extracts a number of \nother extracts could be identified in which a base was articulated but where \nthe target was not clearly identified in the surrounding discourse, although \noften the target could be inferred from earlier discussions or later solutions. \nThirty-eight instances of this type of extract were produced by the novice \ngroups, and five by the expert groups. These extracts were excluded from the \nanalysis for reasons of conservatism as well as to maintain correspondence \nwith Clement\u2019s (1988) analogy-extraction scheme. Therefore, only extracts \nthat directly encompassed a base and a target were considered in subsequent \nanalyses. \nThe Structure of Novice and Expert Analogies \nOnly one analogy drawn by the expert groups, and two by the novice \ngroups, involved similarity at only the relational level without there \nadditionally being a degree of superficial similarity at the level of object-and-\nattribute mappings (see Table 3 for an example of such a \u201cpure\u201d analogy). \nThus the majority of analogies that were made by our participants were what \nGentner (1983) would classify as being literal similarities.  \n(Table 3 about here) \nIn terms of the structure of the analogical mappings that were drawn, \nthe majority of analogies generated by both novice groups (i.e., 35 or 73%), \n\u03c72(1) = 10.08, p = .001, and by expert groups (i.e., 25 or 73%), \u03c72(1) = 7.53, p \n= .006, were classified as involving relational mappings (see the right-most \ncolumns of Tables 4 and 5).   \n(Tables 4 and 5 about here) \nBearman                                                                   The Structure and Function  \n 21 \nThe complexity of the higher-order mappings was examined further in \nterms of whether or not the mapping involved a nested arrangement of higher-\norder mappings. It was found that only 34% of the novice groups\u2019 higher-\norder relational mappings were nested, compared with 60% of the expert \ngroups\u2019. Table 6 depicts a nested analogy that was generated by an expert. \nThis analogy expresses the idea that one person could get some repayment \nback from another person (who had apparently stolen from them) by forcing \nthe purported thief to transfer property to them. This analogy was based on the \nprevious experience of the participant, where one company had obtained a \nfinancial return from another company by forcing that company to transfer \ntheir customer contracts. \n(Table 6 about here) \nThe Function of Novice and Expert Analogies \nThe thematic analysis of analogy function resulted in the emergence of \ntwo principal categories that we labelled as problem solving and illustration. \nThe analogies shown in Table 1 and Table 6 are examples of base-to-target \nmappings that served the function of solving a problem. For example, the \npurpose of the analogy in Table 1 was to solve the problem of increasing a \ncompany\u2019s revenue, whilst the analogy depicted in Table 6 was directed \ntoward solving the problem of a company needing to recover money. In \ncontrast, analogies that were drawn for the purpose of illustration were \ndesigned not to facilitate directly the generation or development of a new \nsolution idea, but instead for the purpose of exemplifying an existing idea. \nSuch analogies, therefore, appeared to be illustrative in nature and intent, \nBearman                                                                   The Structure and Function  \n 22 \nrather than directed at problem solving per se. In such cases, the participant \ngenerated a base situation in order to explicate the target. In Table 3, for \nexample, a member of the case-analysis group drew parallels between the \nmarket positions of Coca Cola and Pepsi to illustrate the position faced by an \noil company that was currently under consideration in the case analysis. This \ncomparison seemed to be drawn purely for the purpose of exemplification. \n Tables 4 and 5 show the overall frequency of analogies drawn by \nnovice groups and expert groups, respectively, for the purposes of problem \nsolving versus illustration. Just over one-third of analogies drawn by both \nnovice groups (i.e., 18 or 39%) and expert groups (i.e., 13 or 38%) could be \nclassified as illustrative. Although problem-solving analogies tended to \ndominate the analogical reasoning of our participants, statistical analyses \nrevealed no reliable differences in frequencies: \u03c72(1) = 3, p = .083, for \nnovices; \u03c72(1) = 1.88, p = .17, for experts.  \n We further sub-divided the problem-solving category into direct \nbase-to-target mappings and elaborated base-to-target mappings. Direct base-\nto-target mappings were generally of the form of \u201cX did Y, therefore we can \ncopy X, and also do Y\u201d. As such, direct base-to-target mappings involved the \nuse of an existing idea with little or no modification. In contrast, elaborated \nbase-to-target mappings occurred when the information gained from a base \nanalogy was used to help formulate a target solution that entailed more than \nsimply a wholesale base-to-target mapping. In Table 7, for example, a case-\nanalysis group was discussing the pricing strategy for a new brand of one-\npress champagne. The group used the price of Mo\u00ebt et Chandon as a \nBearman                                                                   The Structure and Function  \n 23 \ncomparison to the new brand, but in order to convey the uniqueness (and \ntherefore desirability) of the new brand they proposed increasing its price \nbeyond that of Mo\u00ebt et Chandon. Rather than just simply mapping over the \nprice of an analogous brand, therefore, the pricing solution was instead \ntailored to fit the properties of the new brand that the group wanted to convey. \n(Table 7 about here) \n Our more refined analysis of problem-solving analogies at the level \nof direct base-to-target mappings versus elaborated base-to-target mappings \nrevealed that 13 (43%) of the analogies drawn by novice groups, and 9 (43%) \nof those drawn by expert groups, were of the elaborated kind rather than the \ndirect kind. Thus both forms of problem-solving analogies were fairly evenly \ndistributed in novice and expert case-analysis behaviour. \n A reliability check was undertaken that involved a second sorter \nindependently producing a second thematic analysis of all novice and expert \nanalogies, both in terms of the problem solving versus illustration \ncategorisation, and also in terms of the more detailed classification of \nproblem-solving analogies as being elaborated or direct. The two thematic \nanalyses were compared and a difference was scored if an extract had been \nplaced in a different position in the two analyses. Consistency between the \ntwo coders was high, at 87% (i.e., only 7 out of 55 extracts were placed \ndifferently).  \nThe Structure and Function of Analogies Compared \nTables 4 and 5 also present the frequency of analogies serving the \npurpose of problem solving versus illustration that arose when participants \nBearman                                                                   The Structure and Function  \n 24 \neither generated object-and-attribute mappings or relational mappings. This \nbreakdown of analogies allows a comparison to be made of the association \nbetween functional aspects of analogising and the structure of the mapping \nprocess across levels of expertise. A maximum likelihood chi-square test \n(Bishop, Fienberg, & Holland, 1975) exploring the structure by function \ninteraction (collapsed across level of expertise) revealed a significant \ndifference between observed and expected frequencies of analogy production, \nG2(2) = 31.17, p < .0001. Looking at problem-solving analogies first, it is \nevident that participants invoked analogies that primarily involved relational \nmappings (exclusively so in the novice case), \u03c72(1) = 39.7, p < .0001. In \ncontrast, when analogies were drawn for the purpose of illustration, novices \nwere more likely to use object-and-attribute mappings than relational \nmappings, a difference that was marginally significant, \u03c72(1) = 3.55, p = .059, \nwhereas experts showed no preference in the mappings that were employed, \n\u03c72(1) = .077, p = .78. \nDiscussion \nOur study of novice and expert case analysis in a management context \nhas produced a number of findings that clarify the nature and role of \nanalogical reasoning in real-world problem solving. First, we have \ndemonstrated that novices working in groups are able to use analogies \nspontaneously to progress problem solving in a similar manner to that \npreviously observed in experts (e.g., Clement, 1988; Dunbar, 2001; Dunbar & \nBlanchette, 2001; Marchant et al., 1993). Second, we have observed no major \ndifferences between novice and expert groups in the extent to which generated \nBearman                                                                   The Structure and Function  \n 25 \nanalogies are structured around relational mappings compared with those that \nare structured around purely object-and-attribute mappings. In general, both \nnovice and expert analogising was dominated by analogies that mapped \nrelational structures between base and target domains. This finding \ndemonstrates a sophistication in the application of knowledge that is not \nusually associated with novices (though see Blanchette & Dunbar, 2000). \nThird, we have found that the analogies that both expert and novices groups \ndrew were directed toward the attainment of two main practical goals: \nproblem solving and illustration.  \nThe latter observation -- that analogies serve different functions -- is in \nline with Dunbar\u2019s (2001) proposal that analogies may be drawn for different \npurposes in applied contexts (see also Blanchette & Dunbar, 2001). Moreover, \nour results also support Dunbar\u2019s (2001) claim that the structure of \nparticipants\u2019 analogical mapping may change, depending on the function of \nthe mapping. Thus, we saw that problem-solving analogies were dominated by \nrelational mappings, whereas illustrative analogies were dominated by pure \nobject-and-attribute mappings. We note, though, that this cross-over pattern \nwas more marked in the analogical reasoning of novices than experts, and \nmay, therefore, need to be interpreted with a degree of caution. In general, \nhowever, it is clear that the low level of object-and-attribute mappings that \narose for both experts and novices when an analogy was designed to solve a \nproblem attests to the importance of relational associations between base and \ntarget situations for facilitating effective problem solving. The fact that \nanalogies that were aimed at illustration often involved pure object-and-\nBearman                                                                   The Structure and Function  \n 26 \nattribute mappings without relational mappings is intriguing. It may well be  \nthat illustrating an idea can frequently be achieved simply and effectively via \na low-order correspondence between quite superficial elements of the base and \ntarget situations.                              \nIn terms of methodological aspects of our research, we note that the \nusual method of constructing an experiment is to have two groups who are \nsimilar in as many ways as possible except for the variables of interest (the \nindependent variables). In real-world situations of the type that pertained in \nthe present study, it is not always possible to create experiments with such \ntight control over variables. In particular, the practicalities of doing research \nin real-world domains means that the settings in which research data are \ncollected are often less than ideal. Owing to the difficulty of collecting data in \nthe present study, we admit to being unable to exert as rigorous a level of \ncontrol as we would have liked over the way that our participants analysed \ntheir given cases -- or, indeed, the cases that they were presented with. As we \nnoted earlier, however, whilst such confounds in the nature of tasks and \nprocedures might arguably have invalidated any examination of key \ndifferences between our two groups, we contend that it makes our findings of \nmarked similarities more compelling since such similarities have arisen in \nspite of differences in tasks and procedures. At a methodological level, too, \nwe are aware that whilst our novices certainly had considerably less domain \nknowledge that our experts, our ability to polarise our novice and expert \nparticipants into those with complete domain na\u00efvety versus those with full-\nblown domain expertise was imperfect. Nevertheless, we believe that our \nBearman                                                                   The Structure and Function  \n 27 \nresults remain a valid examination of analogical reasoning in management \nindividuals with very different levels of domain knowledge along the expertise \ncontinuum. \nOverall, then, our results suggest that unprompted analogising may \nwell be a generic problem-solving strategy that novices, like experts, are able \nto deploy (cf. Holland, Holyoak, Nisbett, & Thagard, 1986). We propose, \nhowever, that contextual factors arsing from the use of meaningful, real-world \ntasks may be critical for observing such spontaneous analogising in novices. \nIn management domains, for example, individuals are able to draw on a wide \nrange of personal and everyday experience that provides valuable background  \nknowledge that can fuel analogy-based reasoning. Thus, whilst our \nmanagement novices were a long way off from being true domain experts, the \nsheer richness of their everyday experience may have enabled them to utilise \nknowledge in similar ways to how experts employ their more specialist \ndomain-based knowledge. It seems clear that some real-world domains would \nallow individuals to draw more fully on everyday knowledge than others. For \nexample, business management,  political science, and creative design are all \ndomains where a rich backdrop of non-specialist knowledge can be applied to \nprogress solutions to problems. The extent to which the observation of \nspontaneous analogical reasoning generalises across a range of applied \ndomains is an issue that needs further empirical examination.  \nAs a final point, we note that the vast majority of the analogies that \nwere drawn by both novices and experts were what Gentner (e.g., 1983; see \nalso Gentner & Markman, 1997) would term literal similarities rather than \nBearman                                                                   The Structure and Function  \n 28 \npure analogies, as they involved a mixture of both object-and-attribute and \nrelational mappings. This observation is consistent with research that has \nfound that the search for an analogy is often based on superficial features of \nthe target information (e.g., Gentner, Ratterman, & Forbus, 1993). The result \nwould also be predicted by the MAC\/FAC model of analogy proposed by \nForbus, Gentner, and Law (1995), who argue that the search for potential \nanalogies is based on superficial problem features, with the deeper-level \nstructure of the base and target predominantly influencing the mapping stage. \nAlthough we agree that superficial similarities between base and target \nsituations are likely to be very important in the search process, other evidence \nindicates that structural similarity may also play a role in the search for a base \nanalogue (cf. Wharton, Holyoak, Downing, Lange, Wickens, & Melz, 1994). \nIndeed, in the ARCS model of analogical retrieval proposed by Thagard, \nHolyoak, Nelson, and Gochfield (1990), structural aspects of the target can \ninfluence the search process. \n We conclude by noting an important qualification to our results, \nwhich is that our research, because of its very focus on spontaneous, real-\nworld analogising, is quite distinct from the majority of analogical problem-\nsolving research, with its laboratory-based emphasis. Indeed, our study differs \nfrom the conventional research approach in at least three key respects. First, \nanalogies in our study could be drawn from any area of a participant's \nexperience; the experimenter did not provide the base information. Second, \nparticipants solved the problems in groups rather than individually. Third, the \nparticipants had extended periods of discussion-based activity that was geared \nBearman                                                                   The Structure and Function  \n 29 \ntoward analysing and solving the presented problem. It is clear that our \nmethod of exploring analogising represents a very different paradigm to the \nstandard experimental approach, such that direct comparisons between the two \nshould be drawn with caution. However, considering that experiments on \nanalogy are themselves supposed to be analogues of real-world situations \n(though in a more controlled and scaled-down form), a reconsideration of how \nanalogical problem solving can fruitfully be investigated experimentally may \nneed to be undertaken. This is especially so in the light of mounting evidence \nthat both novices and experts can frequently and spontaneously make good \nuse of sophisticated analogies in their real-world problem solving. \n \nBearman                                                                   The Structure and Function  \n 30 \nReferences \nAnderson, J.
