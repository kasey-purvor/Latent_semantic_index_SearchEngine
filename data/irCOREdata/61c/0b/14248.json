Oliver, Bradley and Boyle describe a project that is concerned with\nthe development of online courses as part of a pan-European virtual university. The issues\nraised by the paper are timely given the current national initiative to develop a UK e-\nuniversity. McSporran and Young consider the impact of gender issues on online learning\nand contend that there is evidence to suggest that women achieve better results than men\nand that it is the loner male that is disadvantaged by distance learning. Condron reports on\na TLTP (Teaching and Learning Technology Programme) 3 project and in particular on\nthe use of electronic resources to support dialogue in small-group teaching. Campbell,\nLittlejohn and Duncan also look at resources but from the perspective of encouraging the\nreuse of academic resources as part of an initiative to develop a Scottish electronic staff\ndevelopment library. Shaikh and Macaulay report on a study of the use of groupware to\nsupport collaborative learning. Finally, Davies and Denning identify six conceptual areas\nwhich they suggest are of relevance and significance for online behaviour.\nIn this issue we would like to break with tradition and try an experiment. We invite you to\ngive comment on the Davies and Denning paper. In the next issue we will print a synthesis\nof .your reflections, along with a response from the authors. All comments should be sent\nby email to g.conole@bristol.acuk by 18 September.\nGr\u00e1inne Conole\nDeputy Editor\n2\n"}
