Introduction\n1\n \nAnalysis of the history and organisation of the Livid Festival, an Australian popular music \nfestival, is instructive in relation to international debates on \u201ecultural development\u201f. This \ndebate is characterised by discussion of the relations between culture and the construction \nof identity, cross-sectoral partnerships for cultural funding and the convergence of cultural \nforms. In youth cultural productions there are numerous examples of convergence between \npublic and private cultural spheres, and cultural forms which are primarily subsidised or \ncommercial. In popular music festivals, dance parties and nightclubs, avant-garde, heritage \nand commercially successful (or at least viable) cultural forms are presented and \nparticipated in, in ways which converge the traditional distinctions between these forms as \nwell as the distinctions between audience and producer. In addition these programs provide \nframeworks for the convergence of commercial and subsidised cultural forms in ways \nwhich are specifically aimed at achieving large-scale audience participation. To support \nyouth culture as youth engages in and creates it will require a significant broadening of the \nrole of the traditional arts funding agency both in terms of the product and audiences it \nsupports and the models of funding it develops.  \n \nCultural policies targeted at youth present a challenging opportunity to develop cultural \npolicy which is based on a new paradigm of cultural support. Above all this new paradigm \nfor cultural support can be defined as involving the facilitation of cross-sectoral \npartnerships which support cultural process and not or at least not only cultural things. The \nobjective of this paradigm for cultural support is sustainable cultural development \n                                                          \n1\n Part of this paper was written for the First Joint Study Project on Culture and Development in the Asia-\nPacific Region organised by the Korean National Commission for UNESCO. The aims of this project were to \n 4 \narticulated around different policy objectives linked to specific local, national or global \ncommunities. Recognising the potential of cultural programs such as popular music \nfestivals, which routinely (not only as an exception) deal with convergent forms, \npractitioners, modes of participation and audiences, will aid us in thinking through the \ndiscursive reconstruction which is necessary if we are to develop cultural policy which is \nnot characterised by a janus face of \u201eProfit\u201f and \u201eCulture\u201f. \n \n2. Cultural Development \nA number of international conferences and seminars in the last two years have discussed the \nchanging nature of the non-profit arts sector.\n2\n For non-profit arts organisations the major \nfactors affecting this change have been summarised as the gradual withdrawal of \ngovernment from direct funding of the cultural sector (as well as the welfare sector in \ngeneral); globalisation of the cultural market and intensification of competition for audience \nattraction in local cultural markets; changing nature of audience constitution and practices; \nincreasingly culturally diverse nature of national populations; and, identification of a new \n\u201enon-arts\u201f revenue in the public sector as well as in previously untapped parts of the \ncommercial sector (Lavigne 1998, pp. 13-15). \n \nIt is clear in those countries which have had the luxury of strong public sector support for \nthe arts that maintaining the status quo is not possible nor desirable. Even in those countries \nwhere public support has not had a strong tradition, increased competition for the arts dollar \n                                                                                                                                                                                 \nprovide information which could be used in the formulation, evaluation and implementation of cultural policy \nin the region.  \n2\n See for instance Fran\u00e7ois Colbert, ed. 1998, Cultural Organisations of the Future: Colloquium Proceedings, \nMontr\u00e9al, Canada, \u00c9cole des Hautes \u00c9tudes Commerciales de Montr\u00e9al; National Association of the Visual \nArts, 1998, Art of Sight Art of Mind, http:\/\/www.culture.com.au\/nava\/sight.html; Privatization of Culture \n 5 \nhas meant that non-profit arts organisations have needed to be self-searching about what \nthey see as being their role and how they access funding to facilitate this role. This has been \nparticularly so in relation to the convergence of cultural practices and tastes, where the \ndistinctions between what should and should not be funded are increasingly open to \nquestion. In addition to an interrogation of the kinds of projects funded by arts organisations \nthere is an even more basic concern: \u201ehow to fund the arts?\u201f In response to these concerns \ncultural development is being articulated as the new model of arts support.  \n \nThe primary focus of the cultural development agenda has been the application of notions \nof \u201edevelopment\u201f and \u201esustainability\u201f to the relations between communities and culture. \nCultural development programs are based on the encouragement of partnerships between \nnon-profit, government, business, and philanthropic agencies in order to encourage cultural \nsustainability (Intergovernmental Conference on Cultural Policies for Development 1998, \npp. 13-19). However, while the logic underpinning UNESCO\u201fs cultural development \nstatement Our Creative Diversity is democratic and pluralist we must bear in mind that \ncultural policy is inescapably normative, that is, cultural development policies cannot be \nneutral (de Cu\u00e9llar 1996). Tony Bennett and Colin Mercer make the point in a report \ncommissioned for UNESCO that  \n\u201eCulture\u201f and \u201edevelopment\u201f\u2026 were first put together in the context of \nwestern programs of cultural assimilation\u2026 how \u201eculture\u201f and \u201edevelopment\u201f \nare put together and the role that cultural policies play in meditating the \nconnections between them are, ultimately, questions concerning the \nframeworks within which, at both the national and the international levels, \nthe relationships between different human ways of living will be managed. \n(1998, p. 5) \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                 \nProject, New York University, 1998, New Directions in Cultural Policy Conference, \nhttp:\/\/www.nyu.edu\/projects\/privculture\/confer.htm. \n 6 \nWhile cultural development sits comfortably within a socially democratic language, \nnevertheless, we must remain aware that the funding of culture involves a choice, which has \npolitical, social and economic ramifications, as to what is funded and what is not. The \ncultural products which youth produce and consume have not to date tended to be a focus of \ncultural funding, rather, the market has governed the cultural spheres in which youth \nparticipate. If our contemporary policy understanding of culture is as \u201epeople\u201fs own way of \nlife as a value, as a right, as a responsibility and as an opportunity\u201f and not \u201ethe frame of \nreference in which the West\u201fs system of values alone generated rules assumed to be \nuniversal\u201f (de Cu\u00e9llar 1996, p.7), then it will be necessary to move away from our \ntraditional narrow definition of \u201ethe arts\u201f. This will be as important for communities \nasserting their identities within national boundaries as it will be on the international stage.  \n \n3. Cultural Consumption and Youth \nTen years ago Paul Willis\u201fs paradigmatic study of youth Common Culture argued that most \nyouths, while \u201enot involved with the arts\u201f, are \u201eall the time expressing or attempting to \nexpress something about their actual or potential cultural significance\u201f (1990, p. 1). The \nAustralian Cultural Consumption Project, an extensive study of Australian cultural tastes, \npreferences and activities, found that under-25-year-olds had a very high rate of \nparticipation in cultural activities with strong attendance rates at \u201erock concerts, movies, \ntheme parks, night clubs, pubs with live bands and film festivals\u201f (Bennett, Emmison and \nFrow 1999, p. 250).  In addition while young people \u201eread more Australian authors than \nother cohorts\u201f, music was found to be \u201ethe cultural domain of greatest significance\u201f (ibid.). \nThese findings are supported by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) study of Youth \nand the Arts which found that youth had a very high rate of participation in a range of \n 7 \ncultural activities. For instance, attendance at popular music concerts was at a rate twice \nthat for older people; in a range of occupations in the performing arts and film and video \nsectors there was a higher than average representation of youth; and, younger households \nspent 40% a week more on cinema admission and 70% more on music than average \nhouseholds (ABS 1996, pp. 2-3).  \n \nIn the Australians and the Arts survey of Australian attitudes to \u201ethe arts\u201f Saatchi and \nSaatchi Australia described the profile of young people in the following way:  \ncompared with the overall population sample, young people 15 to 24 years \nare more likely to feel neutral about the arts or not like them. While they are \nmore likely to have a limited spontaneous definition of the arts, they are also \nslightly more likely to accept the \u201elittle a\u201f arts and to accept slightly more \nitems in a future definition of the arts. (2000, p. 217) \n \nSaatchi and Saatchi\u201fs finding, in contrast to other surveys which document that young \npeople participate more than average in a large range of cultural activities, registers that \nyoung people show a disinterest in \u2018the arts\u2019. It is important to make clear at this point that \nthe Australians and the Arts survey measured attitudes to the arts on the basis of the survey \nparticipant\u2019s definition of what constituted \u201ethe arts\u201f. Unsurprisingly 79% of those surveyed \nidentified only four items or less which \u201ecame to mind as part of \u201cthe arts\u201d?\u201f (2000, p. 171). \nHowever, the survey also found that when young people were asked to expand that \ndefinition they provided a more extensive definition of \u201ethe arts\u201f than other segments of the \npopulation (2000, p. 217). Clearly what is at issue here is the distinction in the meaning of \nthe two terms \u201eculture\u201f and \u201earts\u201f. How then is youth arts policy to negotiate this \nproblematic that the arts product it has traditionally supported is not the arts product that \nyouth produce and participate in the most? Should audience development as it is targeted at \nyouth continue to aim to encourage attendance and participation in cultural forms which \n 8 \nyouth have clearly demonstrated they are not interested in or is there a more basic question \nat stake here, one which requires us to interrogate what we are supporting, for whom and \nwhy? In order to address these questions we need to investigate the particular dimensions of \nyouth cultural production and participation.  \n \nWhen cultural activity is measured account is taken of the sphere of commercial cultural \nproduction: television, popular music, computer games, dance parties, and so forth. When \nwe discuss \u201ethe arts\u201f we are usually referring to the non-profit cultural sector. The Youth \nand the Arts study shows that \u201ethe difference in the magnitude of the participation rates \nbetween youth and the older population\u201f for venues usually defined as \u201earts\u201f venues \u201ewas \nminimal\u201f and indeed the proportion of youth attending theatre was significantly higher than \nother age groups (ABS 1996, p. 16). However, this study also found that \u201ethe participation \nrate for full time students aged 15-24\u2026 is higher for all venues\/ activities, except popular \nmusic concerts, than for young people not engaged in full time study\u201f (ABS 1996, p. 17). \nThus, our understanding of youth cultural consumption needs to be more sophisticated than \none which imagines simply that young people consume commercial culture (popular music, \ncomputer games, and so forth) and not \u201ethe arts\u201f. Rather, levels of youth participation in the \nentire cultural field are linked to socio-economic factors and above all to educational \ncapital.  \n \nFrench sociologist Pierre Bourdieu has argued that individual cultural consumption and \nparticipation is integrally connected to \u201ecultural capital\u201f which is in turn linked to level of \n 9 \neducational attainment.\n3\n Bourdieu argues that in culture produced and distributed \ncommercially by the mass media consumption \u201eis more or less independent of the \neducational level of consumers\u201f; however, the fields of restricted culture (the \u201ehigh\u201f arts) \n\u201eowe their\u2026 cultural rarity, and thus their function as elements of social distinction, to the \nrarity of the instruments with which they may be deciphered\u201f (1993, p. 120). Tony Bennett \nsummarises Bourdieu\u201fs identification of the contradictory social logic which characterises \narts policy in the following way: \nOn the one hand, the publicness of these institutions\u2014their reliance on \npublic funding and administration, their openness to everyone\u2014places them, \nat least in theory, in the realm of unrestricted culture. On the other hand, \nhowever, the forms of culture whose production and circulation is dependent \non, and takes place through, these institutions belong to the realm of \nrestricted culture in the sense that their consumption\u2014that is, the capacity to \naccess them intellectually and culturally\u2014depends on the acquisition of \nparticular cultural skills which, since these are selectively distributed via the \neducation system are socially rare. (1997, p. 91) \n \nWhat does this mean for cultural policy as it bears on youth? Does this mean that youth \ncultural policy should focus on providing access to those governmentally subsidised forms \nof culture which youth with lower levels of education have demonstrated limited \nparticipation in? Or does this mean that there is no role for youth cultural policy or the \nfunding of \u201eyouth arts\u201f because evidence shows that the commercial market provides the \ncultural product that youth most consumes?  \n \nIt is clear that the key issue for arts programs targeted at youth is the ability of the \ntraditional arts funding structure to build sustainable and productive partnerships with \ncommercial cultural organisations. Indeed, the facilitation of cross-sectoral partnerships for \narts funding is a major focus of contemporary arts policy more generally. How can \n                                                          \n3\n See especially the development of this argument in Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste \n 10 \ngovernment arts funding agencies and non-profit arts organisations build relations with \ncommercial cultural organisations in ways which allow these agencies to retain their focus \non the \u201epublic interest\u201f components of their missions?  \n \n4. What Government can learn from Pop Music\u2014the Livid Festival  \nCommercial popular music festivals are cultural programs which are unparalleled in their \nability to attract the \u201eyouth\u201f cohort. Commercial music festivals present an ideal opportunity \nfor sustainable partnerships between for-profit and not-for-profit cultural organisations \nwhich would facilitate the presentation of diverse cultural product. The significance of \nmusic festivals is clear if we take into account the finding of Youth and Music in Australia \nthat while \u201eparticipation rates for all categories [of music] were higher among those \nstudying full-time\u201f this was not the case for popular music where the participation rate was \n43.3% for those studying full-time and 46.2% for those not studying full-time (London and \nHearder 1997, p. 39).4 Thus, in keeping with Bourdieu\u201fs finding that participation in the \ncommercial cultural field was independent of cultural capital, in Australia, participation in \npopular music attracts an audience which is not limited by educational attainment. \nFurthermore, \u201ethe proportion of 15-24 year olds who went to popular music concerts \n(45.1%) was\u2026significantly greater than the percentage of people aged 25 years or more \nwho attended popular music concerts (22.6%)\u201f (ABS 1996, p. 16). Indeed for the 15-17 \nyear old age group outdoor music festivals were the most attended forms of musical event. \nIf the aim of cultural policy is to facilitate democratic access to a range of cultural products \nand experiences, on these findings the popular music festival is an unmatched site for \nfacilitating this access. However, if traditional arts organisations are to seek partnerships \n                                                                                                                                                                                 \n1994. \n 11 \nwith alternative cultural providers it will require a shift in policy which will take account of \nthe sites in which youth produce and participate in culture. Many of these sites are \ncommercial. Willis argues that  \nour best chances of encouraging an artistic democracy are not through \n\u201edemocratisation\u201f of \u201ethe arts\u201f- opening access for new \u201epublics\u201f to the \nestablished institutions and practice- but through an identification, \nrecognition and support of existing creative experiences and activities not at \npresent regarded as \u201eartistic\u201f but which are now part of our common culture. \n(1990b, p. 10) \n \nIt is in this way that an interrogation of successful youth cultural programs such as the Livid \nFestival can be informative in relation not only to youth cultural policy but also to cultural \npolicy as a whole.  \n \nPopular music festivals have a long history, Woodstock in America and Glastonbury in \nEngland immediately come to mind as classic pop music festivals. The Livid Festival, \nstaged in Brisbane, Queensland, is Australia\u201fs longest running rock and roll festival having \nbeen established in 1988. Livid was started as a reaction to the International Exposition \nwhich was held in Brisbane in 1988. In the context of Expo \u201e88 it was conceived as an \noppositional forum for the exhibition of Brisbane art and music produced by young people. \nDespite its massive growth and commercial success Livid still retains this focus on \nproviding a space for the display of young Brisbane artists and musicians. The Festival \noperates on a philosophy of acting as a forum for young local artists. The first Livid was \nheld under a circus \u201eBig Top\u201f tent and involved two stages alternately showing bands and \nperformance art. As the Festival became bigger the focus on the art component was \nreduced, by 1990-91 the performance stage had taken a minor role. According to Peter \nWalsh, founder of the Festival and one of its current Directors, the removal of the \n                                                                                                                                                                                 \n4\n See also Australian Bureau of Statistics 1996, p.17. \n 12 \nperformance stage from major stage status was as a result of a change in the Festival\u201fs \naudience demographic. According to Walsh the audience for music over the past eleven \nyears has become younger. This observation is in accord with a number of significant \nchanges in radio programming over the last ten years.  \n \nThe demise of Australian teen radio during the 1980s is well documented. According to \nGraeme Turner \u201esince the introduction of commercial FM radio in 1980, and increasingly \n\u2026 since the upheavals in media ownership in 1986-7, teen radio has disappeared from \nmetropolitan Australian radio\u201f (1993, p. 143). However, in contrast to the general trend, \nsince the early 1990s the Australian Broadcasting Corporation\u201fs (ABC) national youth radio \nstation Triple J has been strengthening its appeal particularly amongst the 10-17 year old \nradio listening market (Cupitt, Ramsay, and Sheldon 1996, p. 25). In 1990-91 Triple J \nunderwent a change of policy in relation to its programming format. Specifically this policy \nchange was to shift its target audience to 15-24 year olds, a move down the demographic \nladder. This move was received with a great deal of concern as it was perceived as \ncommercialisation and therefore against the charter of the station (Creswell 1991, p. 27). \nTriple J is a national radio network whose format is to present \u201enew and emerging music\u201f, \nwhich consists of a mix of new Australian music and music from overseas (Cupitt, Ramsay, \nand Sheldon 1996, p. 25). It is this focus on new and Australian music which was seen to be \nthreatened by targeting a younger audience. This is understandable in view of the under-25 \naudience\u201fs preference for American music over Australian music (Bennett, Frow, Emmison \n1999, p. 249). On the other hand, Triple J argued that this adjustment in policy focus meant \nthat the station was providing a more democratically accessible service in a station which \nwas previously seen to cater only to an educated middle class urban elite. The new strategy, \n 13 \nwhich included a focus on regional youth audiences, \u201eacknowledges the disenfranchisement \nof a large section of the radio audience and attempts to do something about it\u201f (Turner \n1993, p. 153). While we cannot prove the links between the broadening of the audience for \n\u201ealternative\u201f music, particularly as this has been supported by Triple J, and the demographic \nshift noted by Walsh in the Livid Festival audience the fact remains that the audience for \nLivid has grown at a great rate since the early 1990s. Indeed despite the fact that a plethora \nof other festivals have emerged in recent years to compete for the substantial commercial \nvalue of Livid\u201fs audience, the Festival has continued to grow from 1800 ticket sales in 1988 \nto 2000\u201fs 40,000 ticket sales.5  \n \nThe art program at Livid plays a significant role in providing a point of focus which acts as \na link between fundamentally different audiences in a situation which could be potentially \nantagonistic. While it is undeniable that the main audience attraction at Livid is the music, \nthe art program contributes to the construction of the festival as more than simply a big \ncommercial event. Livid is the only commercial youth music festival in Australia which has \nan art program. The art program and local bands position Livid as a specifically Brisbane \nshow. This is not to say that the Livid Festival only consists of \u201ehomegrown\u201f music and art \nbut that there is a significant effort made to ensure that a component of the music program \n(in 1999 twelve bands out of fifty) and the emphasis of the art program provides a venue for \nemerging Brisbane artists.  \n \nThe art at Livid is also iconographic of each year\u201fs festival. For instance, in 1994 and 1995 \nBrisbane artist Craig Walsh installed a series of monumental heads. Peter Walsh argues that \n                                                          \n5\n The Livid Festival is second in size only to the Big Day Out which is a touring outdoor rock and roll festival. \n 14 \nit is these heads which most people recall from those Festivals and not the headlining band. \nAt Livid 1999 an appearance was made by Pope Alice (alias Brisbane performance artist \nLuke Roberts) who in an ironic reflection on religion and the end of the millennium moved \nthrough the 35,000 crowd encased in his Popemobile dispensing religious relics.  \n \nDespite the engagement of the audience and the success of the art program component of \nLivid there has been no successful attempt to facilitate partnerships between not-for-profit \nor government arts organisations and Livid.6 Currently Livid self-funds the art program out \nof the profits generated by the Festival. This has been primarily due to the difficulty of \nnegotiation between the commercial interests of the Festival and the traditionally based \npolicy logics which frame most grant programs. Retention of this program as part of the \nFestival has required constant lobbying. This lobbying has come not so much from the \u201earts \ncommunity\u201f, as traditionally defined, but from those practitioners and audiences who \nproduce and engage with the convergent cultural forms which characterise cultural activity \nin festivals like Livid. \n \nThe Livid Festival plays an important role in the development and maintenance of the local \ncultural industry. In addition to the musicians and artists who take part in the Festival there \nis an extended network of small cultural businesses including, promoters, tour managers, \ngraphic designers, publicists, and multi-media companies which, in part, have developed as \na result of and owe their sustainability to the ongoing commercial success of Livid. Many of \nthese micro cultural businesses also work in the local subsidised art sector. Thus, there is \ncross subsidisation between the commercial and subsidised sectors which means that Livid \n                                                                                                                                                                                 \nThe Big Day Out does not have an art program. \n 15 \nhas a significant effect on both the local commercial and subsidised cultural infrastructures. \nYet in the locality out of which Livid operates, the market still governs support for \nemergent cultural businesses. As a result of this there are serious inequities in the ability of \npeople to access the resources necessary to establish, or at least to attempt to establish, a \ncultural business which might be competitive in this environment. \n \n4. Conclusion: Cultural Policy and Youth \nIn the last decade in Australia there have been a number of attempts to develop policy \nwhich addresses youth arts practice and youth arts audiences. Up until recently youth arts \npolicy has tended to be articulated in the language of disadvantage\u2014youth need help \naccessing \u201ethe arts\u201f; in the language of welfare\u2014access to the arts will help disaffected \nyouth; in relation to training new artists; and, in relation to building a new audience for the \narts. Thus, while there have been many attempts to recognise the diversity of young \npeople\u201fs involvement in culture, as Mary-Ann Hunter argues there \u201enevertheless remains a \nsystematic bias in measuring and supporting [the cultural] industry which devalues youth-\nspecific \u2026 modes of production\u201f (1999, p. 123). Instead youth arts policy has tended to \nposition youth in relation to a narrowly defined conception of \u201ethe arts\u201f. Jennifer Craik has \ncharacterised the resulting tensions as involving \u201ethe difficulty of reconciling youth culture \nas broadly practised and consumed with youth culture that is the object of policy initiatives\u201f \n(1998, p. 3).  \n \nThe Australia Council, the Commonwealth Government\u201fs arts funding body, launched its \nYouth and the Arts Framework in October 1999. This attempts to provide a conceptual \n                                                                                                                                                                                 \n6\n That is apart from a small grant from the Brisbane City Council in 1996 to fund aspects of the art program. \n 16 \nframework for 1999-2001 within which the Council can develop policy which takes \naccount of youth. The framework begins with a broad definition of culture as including \n\u201ecultural activities [which] reflect people\u201fs thoughts and experiences of life and do not \nsimply consist of literature, music, performing arts, visual arts, cinema and photography\u201f \n(1999, p. 16). The framework also understands \u201ewhat young people do, own and value, [as] \nnot an extraneous or marginal element of Australian life. Young people are energetic and \nimaginative participants in and contributors to Australian culture and bring to it a \nperspective which can be different from any other group\u201f (1999, p. 17). However, the \nframework used the findings of the Australians and the Arts survey when it contextualised \nitself by stating that \u201eyoung people often report seeing the arts as too expensive, \ninaccessible and often just uninteresting\u201f (1999, p. 20). As already mentioned the \nAustralians and the Arts survey measured attitudes to the arts on the basis of the survey \nparticipant\u201fs definition of what constituted \u201ethe arts\u201f, 79% of respondents identified four \nitems or less as constituting \u201ethe arts\u201f. In this context the Youth and the Arts Framework \nurged \u201eall artists and arts organisations to consider how young people can have access to \ntheir work, what information is available about the art made and presented, what prices are \ncharged and when and where the art is available\u201f (1999, p. 20). This reflects the disjunction \nbetween the cultural processes which youth produce and consume and the arts products \nwhich arts organisations have traditionally supported.  \n \nThe Youth and the Arts Framework is an exciting opportunity for the Australia Council to \nreposition its programs and policy aims in a way which would bring it in line with the \u201enew \nparadigm\u201f of cultural policy as it is being articulated internationally and as it has been taken \n 17 \nup in various ways by some State and local governments.\n7\n While it is too early to tell what \nimpact the Youth and the Arts Framework will have, it seems clear that it is not advocating \nany radical departure from the Australia Council\u201fs role supporting \u201etraditional youth arts\u201f.  \n \nI have discussed above the ways in which the cultural development agenda advocates \nsupporting culture where, when and as it is created by communities and funding it from \nwithin these communities. The Livid Festival is a cultural program which is informed by a \nplural engagement with the cultural forms which young people produce and consume. \nThere is much to be learnt from applying the challenges to policy presented by engaging \nwith the actual cultural forms which youth produce and consume. Colin Mercer and Gillian \nSwanson in arguing that youth arts policy must be situated within a general framework of \nstrategic cultural development recommend that \u201emechanisms of liaison, policy co-\nordination and partnership between the Australia Council and other agencies in the public \nand private sectors are a precondition of effective policy development and implementation\u201f \n(1990\/91, p. 169). In other words arts funding agencies will need to define their objects \nbroadly and recognise that youth arts policies must start from where young people are. As \nBennett et al point \u201eit is clear where they are not: they are not in the art gallery, the art-\ncinema, theatre, opera or concert hall. Nor should it be assumed that this is a failing on their \npart or that the only valid purpose of youth-arts subvention is to attract young people to \nthese cultural sites\u201f (Bennett et al 1990\/91, p. 153). Youth participate in a broad range of \ncultural practices many of which occur in the commercial sphere. It is here that there is a \nclear role for government arts funding in starting from where youth culture is and playing a \n                                                          \n7\n See for instance the Queensland State Government\u201fs Cultural Policy for Young People (2000) which \nsupports A-Venue, a scheme which facilitates access for young people to the music industry (http:\/\/www.a-\nvenue.org\/info.htm) and YAMP, a youth arts mentoring scheme (http:\/\/home.pacific.net.au\/~yamp\/#). \n 18 \nrole by \u201eintervening in the operation of current market arrangements\u201f (Bennett et al \n1990\/91, p. 152). This would be particularly in order to ensure that despite the increasing \nprivatisation of culture there are mechanisms which protect public interest policy \nobjectives. In this case one could see a role for a government arts project in acting in a \npartnership with Livid in order to fund components of the art and music program to ensure, \nfor instance, that there are opportunities at Livid for local early career artists to take \nadvantage of Livid as one of Australia\u201fs largest annual gatherings of young people for the \npurposes of a cultural festival. It is from initiatives of this kind that youth arts policy should \ntake its bearings.  \n 19 \nBibliography \n \nAustralia Council 1999, Youth and the Arts Framework, Australian Council, Sydney. \n \nAustralian Bureau of Statistics 1996, Youth and the Arts, Cultural Industries Statistics \nWorking Group, Cultural Minister\u201fs Council. \n \nBennett, T. 1997, \u201eConsuming culture, measuring access and audience development\u201f, \nCulture and Policy, 8, 1, pp. 89-113. \n \nBennett, T., Emmison, M. and Frow, J. 1999, Accounting for Tastes: Australian Everyday \nCultures, Cambridge University Press, UK. \n \nBennett, T., Miller, T., Swanson, G. and Tait, G. 1990\/91, \u201eYouth Cultures and Arts \nPolicies\u201f, Culture and Policy, 2 & 3, 2 & 1, pp. 135-156. \n \nBennett, Tony and Mercer, Colin 1998, Improving Research and International Cooperation \nfor Cultural Policy, UNESCO. \n \nBourdieu, P. 1993, The Field of Cultural Production: Essays on Art and Literature, Polity \nPress, Cambridge. \n \nBourdieu, P. 1994 Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste, Routledge and \nKegan Paul, London. \n \nColbert, Fran\u00e7ois, ed. 1998, Cultural Organisations of the Future, Montr\u00e9al, Canada, \u00c9cole \ndes Hautes \u00c9tudes Commerciales de Montr\u00e9al. \n \nCraik, J. 1998, \u201eDoes Youth Arts Policy Make a Difference?\u201f, Paper for the Youth Cultural \nDebate Session of ARTEX National, unpublished. \n \nCreswell, T. 1991, \u201eRadio Daze\u201f, Rolling Stone, 450, pp. 27-29. \n \nCupitt, M., Ramsay, G. and Sheldon, L. 1996, Music, New Music and All That: Teenage \nRadio in the 1990s, Australian Broadcasting Authority, Sydney. \n \nde Cu\u00e9llar, J.P. 1996 Our Creative Diversity: Report of the World Commission on Culture \nand Development, UNESCO. \n \nHunter, Mary-Ann 1999, \u201eRedefining Industry: Young People and Cultural Policy in \nAustralia\u201f, Media International Australia incorporating Culture and Policy, 90, pp. 123-\n138. \n \nIntergovernmental Conference on Cultural Policies for Development 1998, Final Report, \nUNESCO. \n \n 20 \nLavigne, M. 1998, \u201eWelcoming Address\u201f, Cultural Organisations of the Future, Colbert, \nF., ed.
