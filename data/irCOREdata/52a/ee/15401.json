The results may indicate intact temporally \nextended self-awareness in ASD.  However, it may be that the DSR task is not an \nunambiguous measure of temporally extended self-awareness and it can be passed \nthrough strategies which do not require the possession of a temporally extended self-\nconcept.       \nKeywords: Autism spectrum disorder; metarepresentation; self-awareness; self-concept; \nself-recognition; theory-of-mind.  \nDelayed self-recognition in autism spectrum disorder 3\nDelayed self-recognition in children with autism spectrum disorder\nA number of studies, using a variety of paradigms, suggest that aspects of self-awareness \nare diminished and\/or atypical in autism spectrum disorder (ASD).  For instance, \nindividuals with ASD have difficulty identifying and reflecting on their own mental states \n(Frith & Happ\u00e9, 1999), as well as their own emotions (Ben Shalom, Mostofsky, Hazlett, \nGoldberg, Landa, Faran, McLeod, Hoehn-Saric, 2006; Gaigg & Bowler, 2008; Hill, \nBerthoz, & Frith, 2004).  At a more basic level, a specific difficulty amongst children \nwith ASD with using personal pronouns such as \u201cme\u201d and \u201cyou\u201d to label self and others \nsuggests a diminished ability to explicitly differentiate themselves from other selves \n(Jordan, 1989; Kanner, 1943; Lee, Hobson, & Chiat, 1994).\nHowever, not all aspects of self-awareness are impaired in ASD.  Many have \nargued that the \u201clitmus test\u201d of explicit, conceptual self-awareness is mirror self-\nrecognition (Amsterdam, 1972; Gallup; 1970).  The mirror self-recognition task involves   \ncovertly marking a child\u2019s face with a spot of rouge and then presenting them with a \nmirror.  An objective representation of self is ascribed to any child who touches the rouge\nupon seeing their reflection.  Typically developing children pass this task at \napproximately 18 months of age (Anderson, 1983; Courage, Edison, & Howe, 2004; \nLewis & Ramsey, 2004) and a number of studies have demonstrated that children with \nASD are capable of mirror self-recognition at a mental age of 18 months (Dawson & \nMcKissick, 1984; Ferrari & Matthews, 1983; Neuman & Hill, 1978; Spiker & Ricks, \n1984).  This demonstrates that children with ASD detect the equivalence between the \ncurrently perceived mirror self-image and their represented bodily self-image (Povinelli, \nDelayed self-recognition in autism spectrum disorder 4\n2001).  Thus, even relatively developmentally immature children with ASD appear to\npossess accurate mental representations of what they look like \u2013 they have own-body\nconcepts (but see Hobson, 1990; Loveland, 1993; and Mitchell, 1997, for alternative \nexplanations).  \nFurther suggesting that individuals with ASD are aware of their physical selves,\nWilliams and Happ\u00e9 (in press) found that children with ASD could successfully \ndiscriminate between internally and externally caused changes in their perceptual \nexperience.  These results suggest that individuals with ASD are self-aware of their \nagency. Thus, although some aspects of self-awareness are atypical in ASD, at least \nsome elements appear to be intact.  However, a relatively under-researched question is \nwhether individuals with ASD show temporally extended self-awareness.  \nTemporally extended self-awareness involves awareness of one\u2019s place in and \ncontinued existence through time (see Moore & Lemmon, 2001).  It is what allows me to \nrecognise that \u201cI am the same self that I was yesterday\u201d (James, 1890\/1950, p.332), \nproviding a sense of personal continuity through time.  Temporally extended self-\nawareness is likely to depend on certain representational abilities as well as aspects of \ntemporal understanding.  The fact that the temporally extended self-concept incorporates \nmultiple representations of past, present, and future states of self suggests that it takes the \nform of a metarepresentational structure (Povinelli, 2001). Metarepresentation enables an \nindividual to entertain multiple, and possibly contradictory, representations of the same \nobject or event, and understand them as (alternative) representations of that object or \nevent (Perner, 1991).  In relation to temporally-extended self-awareness, \nmetarepresentation may allow one to \u201corganise previous, current and future \nDelayed self-recognition in autism spectrum disorder 5\nrepresentations [of self] under a temporally extended metaconcept of \u2018me\u2019\u201d (Povinelli, \n2001, p.87).  Through metarepresentation, therefore, alternative representations of self \ncould be understood as alternative instances of a single self that persists through time.  \nTemporally extended self-awareness may also presuppose a concept of the \n\u201ccausal arrow of time\u201d \u2013 a conception of time as a sequence of chronologically ordered, \ncausally related episodes (Povinelli, Landry, Theall, Clark, & Castille, 1999).  \nMetarepresentation allows one to represent multiple states of self from different time \npoints.  However, a degree of temporal understanding may be required to understand the \ntemporal-causal connections between these states of self, and this is essential for \ntemporally extended self-awareness.  \nGiven the possible cognitive underpinnings of temporally extended self-\nawareness, there are grounds for predicting that individuals with ASD will have \nattenuated temporally extended self-awareness.  For example, it is established that \nchildren with ASD have difficulties with metarepresentation (e.g., Happ\u00e9, 1995) and with \naspects of temporal cognition (Boucher, Pons, Lind, & Williams, 2008).  Boucher et al. \nfound that children with ASD were significantly impaired in their ability to represent and \nunderstand changes over time.  Specifically, they found that children with ASD had \ndifficulty (a) with envisaging the past and future stages of a current situation, (b) with \nrepresenting qualitative changes across time, and (c) with representing a series of \nsubordinate events as comprising a unified whole event spanning the component stages.  \nAccordingly, children with ASD may be less able than children without ASD to consider \nmultiple, alternative representations of the self from different time points and to \nDelayed self-recognition in autism spectrum disorder 6\nunderstand the temporal-causal relations among these past, present and future states of \nself, resulting in diminished temporally extended self-awareness.  \nIn typical development, temporally extended self-awareness has been assessed \nwith the delayed self-recognition (DSR) paradigm (Povinelli, Landau, & Perilloux,\n1996).  In this test, the experimenter and child are filmed playing a distractor game, \nduring which the child is patted on the head in praise.  Whilst praising the child, the \nexperimenter covertly places a large sticker on top of their head.  After a delay of three \nminutes, the pair watch the recording of the distractor game, including the sticker \nplacement, and the child\u2019s reaction is assessed.  Successful performance, like mirror self-\nrecognition, involves mark-directed behaviour \u2013 reaching up to touch or remove the \nsticker. \nThe test is supposed to establish whether the child understands the temporal-\ncausal relation between their \u201cpast self\u201d (represented on the screen) and their \u201cpresent \nself\u201d (currently watching the video image).  According to this logic, individuals who \npossess a temporally extended self-concept should expect the sticker to be on their head \nhere-and-now (i.e., when watching the video recording) not just there-and-then (i.e., in\nthe video recording).  Typically developing children pass the task at around 4 years of \nage (Povinelli et al., 1996; Suddendorf, 1999; Zelazo, Sommerville, & Nichols, 1999),\nduring the same developmental period in which metarepresentation (Perner, 1991) and an \nunderstanding of the causal arrow of time (Povinelli et al., 1999; McCormack & Hoerl, \n2007) emerges. During the DSR task, children are also asked to name their video image.  \nChildren below 4 years of age show a greater tendency to label their image using their \nDelayed self-recognition in autism spectrum disorder 7\nproper name rather than the pronoun \u201cme\u201d, and this tendency is associated with failing to \nshow mark-directed behaviour (Povinelli et al., 1996).\nThe aim of the current study was to assess temporally extended self-awareness in \nASD using the DSR paradigm.  There has been one previous investigation of DSR in \nASD, summarised in a book chapter by Nielsen, Suddendorf and Dissanayake (2006).  A\nsample of 15 children with high functioning ASD and 15 mental age matched comparison \nchildren aged 5 to 9 years was assessed.  Whilst all of the comparison children passed the \ntask, 83%1 of the children with ASD were found to pass.  However, no statistics or \nmethodological details were reported making interpretation of these results difficult.  \nOn the basis of previous research, indicating ASD-specific impairments in \nmetarepresentation and temporal cognition, it was predicted that children with ASD in \nthe present study would show diminished performance on the DSR task.  It was also \npredicted that children with ASD would show an increased propensity to use their proper \nnames as opposed to the pronoun \u201cme\u201d to label their video self-images.  Previous \nresearch has indicated that even fairly verbally able children with ASD show an elevated \ntendency to use their proper names when naming photographs (Lee et al., 1994).  The \nsame pattern is, therefore, likely to apply to video images.  Finally, the relation between \nperformance on the DSR task and a false belief task was explored, since both are thought \nto rely on the capacity for metarepresentation.  \nDelayed self-recognition in autism spectrum disorder 8\nMethod\nParticipants\nApproval for this study was obtained from the appropriate university ethics committee.  \nParticipants were recruited through schools located in South-East England.  The parents \nof all participants gave their informed, written consent for their children to take part.  \nThe ASD and comparison groups each consisted of 30 participants who were \nindividually matched on chronological age (CA) and verbal mental age (VMA), as \nassessed with the British Picture Vocabulary Scale (Dunn, Dunn, Whetton, & Burley, \n1997).  Participant characteristics are presented in Table 1.\n[Place Table 1 about here]\nThe groups did not differ significantly in terms of VMA, t(58) = -0.13, p = .90, r = .02; \nCA, t(53.29) = 0.25, p = .81, r = .03; or verbal IQ, t(55.00) = -0.99, p = .33, r = .13.  \nAll of the children\/adolescents in the ASD group attended specialist autism \nschools or units.  A thorough review of their Statements of Special Educational Needs \nconfirmed that they had received formal diagnoses from qualified clinicians of Autistic \ndisorder (n = 23) or Asperger\u2019s disorder (n = 7), according to the criteria set out in the \nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (American Psychiatric \nAssociation, 1994).  The comparison group consisted of children\/adolescents with \ngeneral learning disability of unknown origin (n = 14) and typically developing children \n(n = 16).  Any mention of social communication difficulties in any comparison child\u2019s \nDelayed self-recognition in autism spectrum disorder 9\nStatement of Special Educational Needs resulted in exclusion from the comparison group, \nas this may have been indicative of ASD-related symptoms or even undiagnosed ASD.\nApparatus\nThe recording equipment used for the DSR task included a digital video camcorder,\nwhich was connected to a 38cm flat-screen, colour monitor.  This equipment was used to \nrecord the distractor game and subsequently replay the recording of the game to the child.  \nAn additional video camera was used to record the entire session, the recordings from \nwhich were later used to code participant responses.  The two video cameras were \npositioned opposite the table at which the child was to be seated, approximately 1.5 to 2.5 \nmetres away.  The screen was also placed facing the table where the child was to be \nseated.  During the sticker game, the screen was covered with a piece of fabric to \neliminate reflections.  \nThe materials used for the distractor game included two plastic cups, featuring\ncartoon animal pictures (Donald Duck and Mickey Mouse), and a selection of children\u2019s \nstickers.  Neon coloured sticky notes (3.8 \uf0b4 5.1cm) were used to mark each child\u2019s head.  \nThese were hidden, out of the child\u2019s sight, on the back of the child\u2019s chair.  \nProcedure\nThe child was invited to play a distractor game in which they could win some stickers.  \nExperimenter and child sat side-by-side at a table.  The experimenter told the child that \nshe was going to record the game on video so that they could watch it back later.  She \nturned the cameras on and returned to her seat.   She then invited the child to choose a \nDelayed self-recognition in autism spectrum disorder 10\nsticker that they would like to win and then asked them to cover their eyes so that they \ncould not see what she was doing.  She then hid the sticker under one of the cups.  She \ntold the child that they could uncover their eyes and then gave them a simple clue \nindicating which cup the sticker was under.  For example, \u201cIt\u2019s under the animal who\u2019s \nwearing shoes.\u201d  When the child had correctly guessed and retrieved the sticker from \nunder the cup, the experimenter patted the child on the head in praise (sham marking).  \nOn the third round of the game, when the time came to pat the child on the head, the \nexperimenter reached for a sticky note from the back of the child\u2019s chair and \nsurreptitiously placed it on top of their head, near the front of their hair.  The child was \nthen given an unrelated filler task (they were asked to draw a picture of their choice),\nwhich lasted three minutes.  The experimenter then told the child that it was time to \nwatch themselves on television.  They watched the playback together on a monitor and \nthis was filmed by the second video camera in order to record the child\u2019s reactions to the \nimage.  The video was replayed to the child from the second round of the distractor \nsticker game.  The experimenter ensured that they paid attention throughout.  Before the \nmarking event, the child was asked, \u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d (pointing to their image on the \nscreen).  If they did not give a response they were asked, \u201cCan you tell me who that is?\u201d \n(pointing to their image on the screen).  \nIf the child had not spontaneously removed the sticker within five seconds of \nseeing the marking event, they were given Prompt 1: \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d (pointing to the \nimage of the sticker on the screen).  If they did not respond, the experimenter gave them \nPrompt 2: \u201cI think it\u2019s a sticker. Can you get that sticker for me?\u201d   If the child was \nunable to locate the sticker after these prompts, they were shown live video feedback of \nDelayed self-recognition in autism spectrum disorder 11\nthemselves on the same screen.  Prompts 1 and 2 were once again used.  Live video \nfeedback acted as a control procedure to ensure that participant\u2019s who failed DSR were \ndoing so because of difficulty with delayed self-recognition rather than difficulty with \nself-recognition per se.   \nThe children also completed a standard unexpected contents \u2013 \u201cSmarties\u201d \u2013 false \nbelief task (Perner, Frith, Leslie, & Leekam, 1989). The Smarties task was implemented\nbecause it provides an assessment of mental state understanding in self, as well as others.  \nIn this task, participants are asked test questions about their own previous false beliefs as \nwell as the false beliefs of another person.\nReliability \nAn independent rater was trained to code performance on the DSR task, according to the \nlevel of prompting required to elicit mark-directed behaviour, as well as verbal responses.  \nThe second rater re-scored 17 of the videos.  Inter-rater reliability was assessed using \nCohen\u2019s Kappa, the value (\uf06b = .91) of which indicated \u201calmost perfect agreement\u201d \n(Landis & Koch, 1977). Disagreements were resolved through discussion.   \nData Analysis and Scoring\nThe data from the DSR task were analysed in a number of different ways.  Firstly, group \ndifferences in the number of children who showed mark-directed behaviour at any point\nduring the delayed video playback period were analysed.  Secondly, the amount of \nprompting required to elicit mark-directed behaviour was considered.  It has been \nsuggested (D. Povinelli, personal communication) that spontaneous and prompted mark-\nDelayed self-recognition in autism spectrum disorder 12\ndirected behaviour may index different underlying abilities.  Whereas spontaneous mark-\ndirected behaviour is most likely to indicate the presence of a temporally extended self-\nconcept, showing mark-directed behaviour after Prompt 2 (\u201cI think it\u2019s a sticker. Can you \nget that sticker for me?\u201d) may be the consequence of a simple search strategy.  Hence, the \nchild may reason: I\u2019m being asked to find the sticker, therefore there must be one \nsomewhere around here.  In the video it\u2019s on my head so maybe I should check there.  In \nother words, individuals may be primed to search on their heads without understanding \nthe causal connection between the past self represented on screen and their present self.  \nShowing mark-directed behaviour after Prompt 1 (\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d) is unlikely to \nreflect such a simple search strategy, since it is not a directive.  Whilst the first prompt \nmight serve simply to draw the child\u2019s attention to the image of the previously un-noticed \nsticker, the second prompt may actually scaffold the child\u2019s performance to a significant \nextent, encouraging mark-directed behaviour through a search strategy. \nDSR performance was also analysed as a continuous variable.  Continuous DSR \nscores were assigned as follows: if children showed mark-directed behaviour \nspontaneously they scored 3 points; after Prompt 1 they scored 2 points; after Prompt 2\nthey scored 1 point; and if they failed to show mark-directed behaviour at all during the \ndelayed video feedback they scored 0 points.  \nGiven that directional hypotheses were proposed, unless otherwise stated, all p-\nvalues reported are for one-tailed tests.  Effect sizes are reported in terms of r for \ncontinuous variables and phi (\uf066) for categorical variables.\nDelayed self-recognition in autism spectrum disorder 13\nResults\nResults indicated that whereas every comparison participant showed mark-directed \nbehaviour at some point during the delayed video playback period, only 25 (83.3%) of \nthe 30 children with ASD did so.  This group difference was statistically significant, \nFisher\u2019s exact p = .03, \uf066 = .30.  \nOf the five children with ASD who failed to show mark-directed behaviour during \nthe delayed feedback period, only two responded by showing mark-directed behaviour \nwhen given live video feedback.  Thus, only 2\/30 children with ASD could be said to \nhave a specific difficulty with DSR. The three children who failed both delayed and live \nvideo self-recognition were excluded from subsequent analyses (except where noted).  \nThus, a total of 25\/27 participants with ASD and 30\/30 comparison participants showed \nmark-directed behaviour at some point during the delayed feedback period.  This group \ndifference was not significant, Fisher\u2019s exact p = .22, \uf066 = .20.  \nThe degree of prompting required to elicit mark-directed behaviour was \nconsidered next.  Table 2 provides a breakdown of DSR performance according to the \nlevel of prompting required to elicit mark-directed behaviour within each of the groups.  \n[Place Table 2 about here]\nGroup differences in the number of children showing mark-directed behaviour \nspontaneously, after Prompt 1 and after Prompt 2 were analysed using a 2 (Group: \nASD\/comparison) \uf0b4 3 (DSR: spontaneously\/after Prompt 1\/after Prompt 2) Chi-square \nDelayed self-recognition in autism spectrum disorder 14\ntest2.  This test revealed no significant group differences, \uf063\u00b2(2, N = 55) = 2.68, p (two-\ntailed) = .29,  \uf066 = .22.  Thus, children with ASD were not significantly less likely than \ncomparison children to spontaneously notice the sticker and show mark-directed \nbehaviour when presented with delayed video feedback, and not significantly more likely \nto require Prompt 2 in order to elicit mark-directed behaviour.\nDSR performance was also analysed as a continuous variable.  Group differences \nin continuous DSR scores were assessed using a Mann-Whitney test, which indicated \nnon-significantly better performance in the comparison group (M = 2.13, SD = 0.86) than \nin the ASD group (M = 1.78, SD = 0.86), U = 320.00, z = -1.43, p = .07, r = .20.  \nParticipants\u2019 verbal responses to the self-image naming question, \u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d \nwere considered next (for the entire sample, including live video failers).  One child with \nASD failed to respond and was excluded from the subsequent analysis. Within the ASD \ngroup, 8\/29 (27.6%) children used their proper name.  This compared to only 2\/30 (6.7%) \nchildren in the comparison group.  All remaining children used the pronoun \u201cme\u201d.  The \nassociation between group and response to the naming question was significant, Fisher\u2019s \nexact, p = .04,  \uf066 = .28.  \nSince only two participants failed to show mark-directed behaviour during the \nDSR task, it was not viable to statistically assess the association between DSR \nperformance and verbal responses.  However, it should be noted that one of these \nchildren failed to provide a verbal response and the other responded with the pronoun \n\u201cme\u201d.  Similarly it was not possible to analyse the relationship between DSR and false \nbelief task performance.  The two children who did fail DSR also failed both the Smarties \n\u201cself\u201d and \u201cother\u201d questions.  \nDelayed self-recognition in autism spectrum disorder 15\nIn terms of performance on the false belief task (for the entire sample, including \nlive video failers), two children with ASD, but no comparison child, failed the \u201creality\u201d \ncontrol question.  Of the remaining 28 children with ASD, 14 (50%) passed the other-\nperson false belief question, compared to 24\/30 (80%) comparison participants.  This \ndifference was significant, \uf063\u00b2(1, N = 58) = 5.77, p = .02,  \uf066 = .32.  Nineteen out of 28 \n(67.9%) participants with ASD passed the own false belief question, compared to 26\/30 \n(86.7%) comparison participants.  This difference only approached significance, \uf063\u00b2(1, N\n= 58) = 2.95, p = .08,  \uf066 = .23.\nDiscussion\nContrary to predictions, the results of this study demonstrated undiminished DSR\nperformance amongst children with ASD relative to age and verbal ability matched \ncomparison children.  Once children who failed live self-recognition were excluded from \nthe analysis, no significant differences between the groups were observed in terms of the \nnumbers of children showing mark-directed behaviour during the delayed feedback \nperiod. Overall, only two out of 30 children with ASD were found to have a specific\ndifficulty with delayed self-recognition.  These results are consistent with those obtained \nby Nielsen et al. (2006), who also found that the majority of children with ASD passed \nthe DSR task.\nWhen the degree of prompting required to elicit mark-directed behaviour was \nconsidered, it was found that children with ASD were neither significantly less likely \nthan comparison children to show spontaneous mark-directed behaviour, without the \nDelayed self-recognition in autism spectrum disorder 16\nneed for verbal prompting, nor significantly more likely to require Prompt 2 (\u201cI think it\u2019s \na sticker.  Can you get that sticker for me?\u201d) to demonstrate mark-directed behaviour.\nThus, the high rate of mark-directed behaviour in the ASD group could not be attributed \nto the use of a simple search strategy elicited by Prompt 2.  Furthermore, when DSR \nperformance was considered as a continuous variable, the group difference only \napproached significance.  \nIt is important to contrast the unattenuated DSR task performance amongst \nparticipants with ASD in the current study with their significant impairments in the use of \npersonal pronouns and in metarepresentational ability.  Relative to comparison \nparticipants, participants with ASD were significantly more likely to respond with their \nproper names, rather than the pronoun \u201cme\u201d, when asked to label their video image.  This \nobserved difficulty with pronoun use is consistent with previous studies (e.g., Lee et al., \n1994) and implies diminished self-awareness in a proportion of children with ASD.  \nChildren with ASD were also impaired in their capacity for metarepresentation, relative \nto comparison participants. Indeed, the percentage of children with ASD in the current \nstudy who passed the other-person test question of the unexpected contents false belief \ntask (50%) was closely comparable to previous studies assessing participants with ASD \nof similar developmental levels (e.g., Fisher Happe, & Dunn, 2005). This demonstrates \nthat false belief task performance in the current study was representative of the \nperformance of children with ASD of this ability range in general, making the lack of a \nsignificant group difference on the DSR task even more striking.  \nDelayed self-recognition in autism spectrum disorder 17\nDespite the fact that the current study showed DSR performance to be intact in \nASD, it may be premature to draw the conclusion that temporally extended self-\nawareness is, therefore, unimpaired in ASD.  Firstly, it must be acknowledged that \nneither the current study nor the study by Nielsen et al. (2006) addressed the question of \nwhether children with ASD would show DSR at the appropriate chronological age of \nfour years (the youngest child in the current study was five years old).  Indeed, it seems \nlikely that a certain level of cognitive ability is necessary for successful DSR.  Thus, any \nfour year old child who is cognitively delayed, as many children with ASD are, may \nexperience difficulties with the DSR task.  \nMoreover, whilst some may consider the DSR task to be the litmus test for \ntemporally extended self-awareness in typically developing children, the task is not \nunambiguously such a measure.  For example, Povinelli (2001) argues that DSR may be \nachieved without a temporally extended self-concept, through alternative cognitive \nmechanisms. He suggests that some children may simply detect the match between their \nmental representations of what they look like and the images presented to them on the \ntelevision screen. Although there is a kinaesthetic mismatch, in that the movements of \nthe video image of the child are not contingent with the current movements of the child \nthemselves, there is a featural equivalence between the video image of the child and the \nchild\u2019s physical self-representation.  It may be that this featural equivalence is sufficient\nto prompt mark-directed behaviour in the absence of a temporally extended self-concept.  \nIn other words, the child may recognise themselves in the video, without understanding \nthat it is a representation of them as they were three minutes previously.  \nDelayed self-recognition in autism spectrum disorder 18\nIf it is possible for children to show mark-directed behaviour in the DSR task in \nthe absence of a temporally extended representation of self, then the lack of a relationship \nbetween DSR and false belief task performance is unsurprising, with only the latter \nrelying on metarepresentation.  It might also mean that some of the children in the current \nstudy who appeared to pass the task, in fact, lacked a fully developed temporally \nextended self-concept.  This might account for the ceiling effect and lack of a group \ndifference in DSR performance observed in the current study.  \nMoreover, there is indirect evidence to suggest that temporally extended self-\nawareness may be impaired in ASD.  For example, individuals with ASD have impaired \nepisodic memory (Bowler, Gardiner & Grice, 2000; also see Boucher & Bowler, 2008).  \nEpisodic memory is defined as memory for personally experienced events that occurred \nin a specific place at a specific time.  Wheeler, Stuss and Tulving (1997, p.349) argue that \nepisodic retrieval involves the understanding that \u201cthe self doing the [re] experiencing \nnow is the same self that did it originally\u201d.  Thus, episodic memory difficulties in ASD \nmay at least be partially attributable to an underlying impairment of temporally extended \nself-awareness (Lind & Bowler, 2008).  \nFurther research could clarify the issue of whether or not children with ASD pass \nthe DSR task because they have temporally extended self-concepts.  Following the \nrationale of Povinelli and Simon (1998), children with ASD could be tested for DSR after \nboth brief (3 minute) and extreme (7 day) delays.  If children with ASD show mark-\ndirected behaviour because they detect the featural match between their bodily self-\nrepresentation and the video self-image, they should do so when presented with\nrecordings after both short and long delays, since their physical features will remain\nDelayed self-recognition in autism spectrum disorder 19\nlargely invariant across both durations.  On the other hand, if they show mark-directed \nbehaviour because they possess a temporally extended self-concept, they should only do \nso after a short delay. If they understand the temporal-causal relations between present \nand various past states of self, they should realise that the image recorded shortly before \nbears a fairly direct causal relation to their current self, whereas the image recorded a \nweek before bears a far less direct causal relation to the current state of self and is, \ntherefore, unlikely to be informative about the appearance of the current self (a sticker is \nunlikely to remain undiscovered on one\u2019s head for a whole week!).  \nEven if the validity of the (short delay) DSR paradigm as a measure of temporally \nextended self-awareness is questionable, the results of the current study still provide \nvaluable insight into the nature of self-awareness in ASD.  They provide further evidence \nthat most children with ASD are aware of their physical selves.  Nevertheless, it was a \nstriking finding that three children with ASD (but no comparison child) failed live video \nself-recognition, apparently demonstrating a profound diminution of self-awareness.  In \ntypical development, 90% of 3-year-olds pass live self-recognition (Suddendorf, \nSimmock, & Nielsen, 2007).  Thus, on the basis of the verbal mental ages of these \nchildren (2.83, 3.83, 3.42 years) one might reasonably expect them to pass.  \nFinally, it should be highlighted that delayed self-recognition can, at best, only \never hope to directly assess awareness of the self\u2019s physical continuity.  However, it is \nawareness of one\u2019s mental continuity that is likely to be intimately related to higher \ncognitive functions such as episodic memory.  Perhaps this is the element of self-\nawareness upon which further research efforts should be focussed.  \nDelayed self-recognition in autism spectrum disorder 20\nReferences\nAmerican Psychiatric Association (1994).
