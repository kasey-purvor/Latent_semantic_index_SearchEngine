Possible mechanisms to\nexplain the impact of illness and inflammation on growth faltering are discussed.\nChild growth: Growth failure: Nutritional status: Acute-phase proteins\nMalnutrition and growth faltering of children remain major\nhealth concerns in most developing countries. It is,\nhowever, becoming increasingly clear that although\ncompromised food quality and availability can explain\nmuch of the poor growth of children in some areas, in\nothers, for example in rural Gambia, infection and disease\nappear to be the more important variables (Lunn, 2000).\nSuch studies suggest that it is essential that disease\nprevalence and its impact on growth be assessed as part\nof any investigation into the aetiology of malnutrition.\nA wide battery of indicators are available to evaluate\nhealth and nutritional status of populations in the develop-\ning world. Cross-sectional health interviews are routinely\nundertaken with a view to establish major causes of\nmorbidity or usage of health facilities despite widespread\nconcern regarding survey methodologies and the usefulness\nof morbidity reports (Ross & Vaughan, 1986). However,\neven sub-clinical illness can affect growth and more\nrecently, a great deal of interest has developed in measuring\nacute-phase proteins in non-clinical settings to detect the\npresence and severity of systemic inflammation as a\nreflection of the immune response to infection (Rousham\net al. 1998). a1-antichymotrypsin (ACT), in particular, has\na number of advantages over other acute-phase proteins: it\nis very sensitive to a wide range of infections, and unlike C-\nreactive protein (another effective marker of inflammation)\nit remains elevated for a longer time period (Calvin et al.\n1988; Thompson et al. 1992).\nFew studies have examined the relationship between\nacute-phase proteins and morbidity reports (Rousham et al.\n1998), or even clinical examinations and morbidity\nhistories (Katz et al. 1998). Such studies emphasise that\nwhile morbidity surveys have important practical advan-\ntages over detailed clinical or biochemical surveys \u00b1 in\nterms of cost, time, personnel and sample size \u00b1 their value\ndepends upon the extent to which reported data reflect the\nDOI: 10.1079\/BJN2000225British Journal of Nutrition (2001), 85, 125\u00b1131\nq Nutrition Society 2001\nAbbreviations: ACT, a1-antichymotrypsin; ALB, albumin; CWIN, Child Workers in Nepal; HAz, height-for-age z-score; WAz, weight-for-age z-\nscore; WHz, weight-for-height z score.\n* Corresponding author: Dr C.

Their data\nexamine the internal validity of morbidity reports within a\npopulation. Thus Rousham et al. (1998) corroborated\nmaternal reports of child illness with examination of the\nbiochemical and immunological status of rural Bangladeshi\nchildren, using plasma ACT, albumin (ALB), and tests of\nintestinal permeability. Plasma ACT concentrations\nshowed highly significant associations with morbidity,\nparticularly with fever, the combination of fever and\nrespiratory infections, and diarrhoea. The study demon-\nstrated both the usefulness of ACT as a marker of clinical\nor sub-clinical infections and the agreement between\nbiochemical measures and morbidity reports in a popula-\ntion from a developing country.\nHigh ACT levels have also been associated with poor\ngrowth in a relatively small number of studies undertaken\nin the developing world. In rural Gambia, elevated ACT\nvalues were related to the poor weight gain of infants\nbetween 2 and 8 months of age (Lunn et al.1999). Among\npre-adolescent children in Nepal, ACT values were both\npositively related to reports of acute infections and\nnegatively associated with growth increments (Parkin &\nLunn, 1998).\nIn this study, we examined associations between plasma\nconcentrations of ACT and ALB, growth status and\nmorbidity in Nepali boys living in contrasting geographical\nand socio-economic environments. Our focus was to\ncompare health profiles across markedly different ecologi-\ncal settings, rather than test the internal validity of\nmorbidity reports within a particular group. We proceed\nby reporting on plasma levels of ACT and albumin, and\nseverity of stunting, then comment on apparent differences\nin morbidity profiles.\nMethods\nFour populations of Nepali boys (n 104) \u00b1 villagers, urban\nsquatters, homeless street children, and middle-class pupils\n\u00b1 participated in measures of growth status, morbidity, and\nbiochemical markers of infection (during November\u00b1\nDecember 1993). This project was part of a multi-\ndisciplinary study of a larger sample of rural and urban\nNepali children (Baker et al. 1996; Panter-Brick et al.\n1996a) which extended to measures of physical activity via\nheart rates (Panter-Brick et al. 1996b,c), of psychosocial\narousal via salivary cortisol (Panter-Brick et al. 1996d,\nPanter-Brick & Pollard, 1999), of demography and life-\nstyles (Baker et al. 1997), together with ethnographic\nobservation (Baker, 1998). One social anthropologist, one\nbiological anthropologist, and one medical doctor collabo-\nrated in the fieldwork. Issues of consent and participation\nwere carefully considered (Baker et al. 1996).\nStudy groups\nThe populations have been described extensively in Panter-\nBrick et al. (1996a). The village boys lived in a remote\nrural area (without roads, electricity, or provision of\nsanitation) in the foothills of the Himalaya (1870 m) in\ncentral Nepal. They were routinely involved in subsistence\nactivities and also attended the village school. The urban\ngroups were all located in Kathmandu (1300 m). Squatter\nboys lived in poor, overcrowded and illegal settlements;\ntheir parents were mostly road-sweepers, market vendors or\njewellery-makers and had migrated from rural areas in the\nlast 15 years. Most boys worked on the streets, and some\nattended a school run by a nearby non-governmental\norganisation, Child Workers in Nepal (CWIN). Homeless\nboys were street children who lived independently from\ntheir families, spending their nights on the streets or\nsheltering with CWIN. They subsisted principally from\nbegging and picking scrap metals and plastics from\nhousehold and municipal dumps, for resale to junkyards.\nBy contrast, middle-class pupils, drawn from a private fee-\npaying school, were from a privileged background.\nAll available 6\u00b114-year-olds were initially recruited for\ngrowth measurements (n 307 boys) and demographic\ninquiry (n 329 boys), achieving a representative sample\nof the homeless (23 % of the known homeless child\npopulation) and a total sample of available boys for other\ngroups (Panter-Brick et al. 1996a; Baker et al. 1997). The\nstudy concentrated on boys as there were very few\nhomeless street girls. The purposes of the study were\nexplained to the children by assistants who were known to\nthem. The project was facilitated by the village leaders,\nCWIN, school teachers, and the long-standing links of two\nof the authors with the village, homeless, and school\ncommunities.\nMeasures\nAnthropometric status was taken by a single investigator\nfollowing standard procedures (Weiner & Lourie, 1981).\nHeight, weight (with minimal clothing), mid-upper arm\ncircumference and skinfolds were measured using portable\nfield equipment (a Harpenden anthropometer, a Salter\nelectronic scale with 0\u00b42 kg precision, tape and calipers).\nAge reports from the children were corroborated with\nactual demographic records for village and schoolchildren,\nand with staff from a non-governmental organisation for\nstreet and squatter children. Nepali children knew their\nexact age with reference (in months and years) to the Hindu\nor Tibetan calendar (ages had to be approximated for a few\nof the homeless children).\nBlood spots were taken by fingerprick with an auto-\nlancet device (Autolet II, Baxter Scientific Products,\nMcGraw Park, IL, USA). Five drops (about 100 ml) of\nblood were spotted on pre-printed circles on standardised\nfilter paper (Schlecher and Schull #903, Keene, NH, USA).\nSamples were dried at room temperature and refrigerated\nfor no longer than a week before shipment to the UK where\nthey were kept at 2208C until assay.\nFor the ACT and ALB assays, 9 mm diameter discs were\npunched out of the blood spots and the proteins eluted by\nincubation in isotonic phosphosaline buffer (250 ml,\n0\u00b405 M, pH 7\u00b44) for 48 h at 48C. (No further protein was\neluted during a second 48 h incubation). Using data\nsupplied by Schlecher and Schull, the 9 mm filter discs\nwere calculated to contain material from 12\u00b45 ml of whole\nblood, thus the concentration of material in the incubation\nfluid was equivalent to a 1:20 dilution of the blood. ACT\nconcentration in the incubation fluid was measured by an\n126 C. Panter-Brick et al.\nautomated immunoturbidimetric technique (Calvin &\nPrice, 1986) using antibodies (Cat. No. Q0367) and\nstandards (Cat. No. X0908) supplied by Dako, (Ely,\nCambridge, UK). ALB was measured in a similar way\nusing Q0328 antibody and the same standard preparation.\nPlasma concentrations were estimated from whole blood\nvalues using a multiplication factor of 2\u00b426. This value was\ndetermined experimentally in a separate series of measure-\nments in which blood values, obtained as described, were\nregressed against plasma concentrations determined by\nstandard procedures from the same blood samples (Panter-\nBrick et al. 1996d). It should be recognised that these\nplasma concentrations are only approximate, calculated for\ncomparative purposes rather than for determining absolute\nvalues. A similar method for comparing blood spot and\nplasma values has been developed for C-reactive protein\n(McDade et al. 2000).\nMorbidity was evaluated from the reports of children,\nwho were asked whether or not they were ill and what were\ntheir complaints. Two sets of morbidity data were\nconsidered: first, reports of health versus ill-health on the\nactual days on which children gave a blood sample (during\nthe last two weeks of fieldwork); second, pooled informa-\ntion from a separate 10 d period (at the beginning of\nfieldwork) during which children were measured for\ngrowth and cortisol. The competency with which children\nevaluated ill-health was also demonstrated using child-\nfocused participatory research methods (Baker et al. 1996).\nStatistical analysis\nTo standardise anthropometric variables, height-for-age\n(HAz), weight-for-age (WAz) and weight-for-height\n(WHz) z-scores were calculated from children's heights\nand weights relative to the US National Center for Health\nStatistics, using the Centers for Disease Control Anthro-\npometric Software Package (CASP 3.1). The technical\nerror of measurement indicated good reliability for initial\nheight and weight measurements (Panter-Brick et al.\n1996a).\nDisease burden was calculated by a simple count of the\nfrequency of different illnesses reported by children. Only\n74 reports were made on the actual blood sampling days\n(when each child was seen on a single day). However, a\ntotal 1198 reports of health\/ill-health were made at the time\nof the growth and cortisol survey (when each child was\nseen on an average ten occasions).\nDifferences between the four groups of children in terms\nof growth status and biochemical markers were evaluated\nwith analyses of variance and post hoc multiple range tests,\naccepting P , 0\u00b405 as significance level. The relationship\nof plasma protein markers with growth status was\nexamined by multiple regression. The same results\npertained whether or not age was included in the regression\nmodels (to correct for the potential problem of using the\nNational Center for Health Statistics reference population\nto express the growth profile of Nepali children).\nResults\nSample characteristics are shown in Table 1. All groups of\nchildren, except for schoolboys, were stunted \u0085HAz , 22\u0086\nbut not wasted (WHz close to zero). The z-scores for\nvillagers indicate severe stunting (HAz close to 23) and\ngrowth profiles that were significantly different from urban\ngroups \u0085P , 0\u00b4002 for HAz, P , 0\u00b405 for WHz and P ,\n0\u00b406 for WAz).\nPlasma ALB concentrations were normally distributed.\nPlasma ACT values were normally distributed within urban\ngroups (mean 0\u00b439, SD 0\u00b415; median 0\u00b437, range 0\u00b418\u00b1\n0\u00b488 g\/l), but the high values of villagers (mean 1\u00b453, SD\n0\u00b442; median 1\u00b450, range 0\u00b472\u00b12\u00b467 g\/l) skewed the overall\ndistribution. Relative to urban groups, villagers showed\nvery high plasma ACT (P , 0\u00b40001; Fig. 1) and lower\nALB \u0085P , 0\u00b4001\u0086 levels. Within urban groups, the home-\nless showed higher ACT concentrations than both squatters\n\u0085P , 0\u00b4001\u0086 and middle-class children \u0085P , 0\u00b40001\u0086; with\nvalues for squatters also higher \u0085P , 0\u00b4025\u0086 than the\nmiddle-class children. Plasma ALB levels were also\ndifferent between the homeless and middle-class children\n\u0085P , 0\u00b4029\u0086:\nThus, village boys showed both severe stunting and high\nACT values, while the urban middle-class boys showed\nleast stunting and the lowest ACT values; the poor squatter\nand homeless boys showed intermediary values. Plasma\nconcentrations of ACT and ALB were strongly and\nnegatively correlated (r 20\u00b4385, P , 0\u00b40001 for all\nsamples). ACT showed a significant relationship with\nboth stunting and wasting (HAz and WHz, P , 0\u00b4002 and\nP , 0\u00b401 respectively; Table 2). The relationship with HAz\nTable 1.

Comparison of squatter and\nhomeless children who reported ill versus healthy revealed\nno apparent differences in ACT levels; however, larger\nsample sizes would be required to evaluate the significance\nof the small differences noted (i.e. n 98 for a mean\ndifference of 0\u00b404 g\/l between `ill' and `healthy' squatter\nchildren, after the formula in Mascie-Taylor, 1994). In the\ncase of villagers, there were only 2 d of reported illness (for\nwhich ACT was 2 g\/l, compared to 1\u00b45 g\/l on the remaining\n28 d). With these data, the association of morbidity and\nACT within groups cannot be tested.\nThe relative profiles for morbidity reports across the four\nstudy groups were also examined from the more extensive\ndata (a total of 1198 reports) obtained during the growth\nsurvey. Again, the difference between rural and urban\ngroups was striking. Villagers reported the lowest disease\nburden (13 %); their reports were predominantly intestinal\n(including worms) and diarrhoeal complaints. Within urban\ngroups, as expected, middle-class pupils reported ill on\nrelatively fewer days (45 %) than did squatter and home-\nless boys (60 % and 71 % respectively).\nDiscussion\nThe most striking results of this study concern the ACT\nprofiles of rural Nepali children relative to urban counter-\nparts. The values for village boys (mean 1\u00b452 g\/l, SD 0\u00b442)\nare three to four times the levels observed in squatter or\nhomeless children (who are urban destitutes, commonly\ncollecting refuse on the streets), and five times the levels of\nmiddle-class schoolchildren. Values for urban groups\n(mean 0\u00b439 g\/l, SD 0\u00b415) are within the normal range\nreported by Calvin et al. (1988) for UK adults (0\u00b433\u00b1\n0\u00b464 g\/l). However, the values for Nepali rural children are\nwell above those hitherto reported for populations in non-\nclinical settings (although few studies have been under-\ntaken). Rousham et al. (1998), for example, found that\nACT values for `healthy' rural Bangladeshi children, 2\u00b15\nyears old, averaged 0\u00b454 g\/l (no SD given). In the Gambia,\nvalues for 22 children, 6\u00b136 months old, with persistent\ndiarrhoea and severe protein and energy malnutrition,\naveraged 0\u00b49 (SD 0\u00b42) g\/l, with a range 0\u00b465\u00b11\u00b437 g\/l\n(Sullivan et al. 1991).\nValues for ACT are sensitive to the actual assay used in\nthe laboratory as well as dependent on the actual\nconversion of blood spot values to plasma equivalent. In\naddition, they may be sensitive to collection procedures in\nthe field (there was a 2 d delay in refrigerating rural\nsamples, incurred for their transport by foot to Kathmandu;\nhowever such delay is unlikely to have elevated village\nACT values). While these variables might affect the\nTable 2.

ACT levels in rural and urban Nepali children.\n128 C. Panter-Brick et al.\nabsolute values presented in this study, they are unlikely to\naffect the relative profile of rural and urban groups.\nTogether with elevated ACT, village children show\nhypoalbuminaemia (mean ALB 29\u00b40 g\/l (SD 6\u00b43; range 14\u00b1\n47) compared to 33\u00b42 g\/l (SD 4\u00b49; range 22\u00b146) in urban\ngroups). By comparison, Sullivan et al. (1991) report a\nnormal range of albumin levels of 35\u00b145 g\/l (population\nunspecified) and values for young Gambian children with\nprotein\u00b1energy malnutrition averaging 34\u00b41 g\/l (SD 7\u00b42;\nrange 20\u00b47\u00b145\u00b45). The inverse relationship found between\nplasma ACT and ALB suggests that the observed variation\nin both proteins results from the presence of an acute phase\nresponse to infection\/inflammation in the children. During\nan acute phase reaction, plasma levels of ACT and other\nacute-phase proteins become elevated, whilst ALB values\nare lowered. The markedly high ACT and low ALB seen in\nthe village boys indicate a particularly high level of\ninfection\/inflammation in this group.\nThe rural Nepali boys also show severe stunting (height-\nfor-age is close to 23 standard deviations away from the\nNational Center for Health Statistics median). In earlier\npublications, such high levels of stunting have been linked\nto the combination of a very monotonous diet (poor in\nanimal fat and protein) and high levels of physical activity\n(Panter-Brick et al. 1996a,c). However it is noteworthy that\nthe village in question did not experience significant food\nshortages; it was self-sufficient in cultivated foods within\nan agro-pastoral economy (the results of a year-long food\nintake study are found in Koppert, 1988). The present study\ntherefore suggests that much of the stunting in these\nchildren is a consequence of acute and chronic infections\nresulting in inflammatory responses, as indexed by ACT.\nThe negative relationship between HAz and ACT was\ndemonstrated in urban groups, although it was not marked\namong villagers (perhaps because the profile of this smaller\nsample was characterised by already very high levels of\nstunting and ACT).\nWhat light can be shed on the high levels of stunting and\nACT observed in the village sample? Ten years previously,\nfieldwork in the same village showed (for a sample of 0\u00b1\n49-month-olds, including all the boys involved in this\nstudy), that moderate to severe stunting was evident after\nthe first year of life and also that child morbidity \u00b1 reported\nby mothers during structured interviews \u00b1 had a significant\nimpact on growth velocity over 9 months of observation\n(Panter-Brick, 1997). Moreover, parasite infestation was\ncommon (79 % Ascaris, 57 % Ancylostoma duodenale,\n36 % Trichuris trichuria and 31 % Entamoeba histolytica)\nin the general population (analyses of ninety-six stool\nsamples, reported in Panter-Brick, 1997). Vitamin A\nintakes were only 53 % of recommended daily allowances\nfor 7\u00b115-year-old children (Koppert, 1988). Haemoglobin\nvalues, measured by a battery-operated miniphotometer,\naveraged 12\u00b40 (SD 2\u00b48) g\/dl for adult men (reported in\nPanter-Brick et al. 1992). It is not known whether parasite\ninfestation could explain the elevated ACT values as no\ndata on pathogens were collected in this study. However,\nthe previously observed high levels of parasitic infestation,\nsome of which require faeco-oral transmission, suggest an\nenvironment poor in overall hygiene, with frequent\nexposure to a range of pathogens. Under such conditions\nboth clinical and sub-clinical infections and infestations\nmay be expected and it seems likely that this situation is\nreflected in the elevated ACT values (see Rousham et al.\n1998). There may also be some synergistic relationships\nwith nutritional status (vitamin A has been linked to acute-\nphase protein responses to infection; Filteau et al. 1995).\nThere was no known malaria, AIDS, or tuberculosis (save\none case of an adult village migrant), which might explain\nelevated ACT.\nAnother tentative explanation for the high ACT values\nobserved in this study can be offered in light of the\nimportant links between infection, growth faltering and\ndamaged gut function summarised in Lunn (2000). In the\nGambia, levels of ACT (together with C-reactive protein,\ncortisol, and immunoglobulins IgA, IgG and IgM) were\nfound to be elevated early in life and to be closely related to\ngrowth faltering. Measures of intestinal permeability also\nrevealed early and significant damage to the mucosa of the\nsmall intestine (Lunn et al. 1991). Small bowel mucosal\nenteropathy results both in a loss of enzymes (required for\nfood digestion and absorption) and in a leaky intestinal\nbarrier (enabling translocation of macromolecules and\nsubsequent triggering of local and systemic immune and\ninflammatory mechanisms). Lunn (2000) argued that\nmucosal damage and the persistence of chronic inflamma-\ntion were likely to account for poor growth and that\nabnormal intestinal permeability values persisted through-\nout childhood and adulthood. Moreover, the prevalence of\nmucosal enteropathy was very high (it was found in every\none of over 400 rural Gambian infants studied). The\ncondition was for the most part asymptomatic \u00b1 it was\npresent in apparently healthy Gambian infants and did not\nrelate to diarrhoea prevalence. As there is now evidence\nthat similar mucosal damage occurs in children from other\nparts of the developing world (Lunn, 2000), it seems\npossible that the Nepali boys showing a similar cluster of\nbiochemical variables (low ALB, high ACT) accompany-\ning poor growth may also have a damaged small intestinal\nmucosa. To test this possibility, measurements of intestinal\npermeability have been initiated in the study area.\nA final observation concerns the associations between\nchildren's reported morbidity and observed levels of acute-\nphase protein. Village boys reported the lowest burden of\ndisease, which contradicted the biochemical evidence for\nsignificantly higher ACT levels relative to urban counter-\nparts. By contrast, within the three urban groups, levels of\nthe acute-phase protein broadly reflected levels of reported\nmorbidity. As stated above, it is possible that villagers\nsuffered from gut enteropathy, which would lead to growth\nstunting even in the absence of obvious signs of infection.\nHowever, it is also likely that villagers significantly under-\nreported symptoms of ill-health due to a routine experience\nof illnesses and a low expectation of health care treatment\n(a health post had recently been built in the village, but was\nnot staffed). In turn, the fact that homeless boys reported\nthe most ill-health can be attributed both to the likelihood\nof exposure to trauma and pathogens, related to their\nlifestyle as street children, and to their expectation of\ntreatment, related to their access to free medical care\nprovided by CWIN. The squatter boys shared both the same\nday-time environment (begging and shifting garbage on the\n129Acute-phase protein, stunting and morbidity\nstreets) and medical care facilities. The complaints of\nmiddle-class boys (stomach-ache, headache) are probably\nrelated to a high awareness of health matters rather than to\nactual significant ill-health.\nMorbidity reports, therefore, not only reflect different\nexposure to diseases, but also different experiences of\nillnesses or habituation to ill-health as well as different\ndemands or expectations for treatment. As Ross & Vaughan\n(1986) noted, it is difficult to assess `the differential\nimportance attributed to identical symptoms by subgroups\nof the same population. For example, diarrhoea in young\nchildren may be considered `normal' and not worth\nreporting\u00bc'. The rates of sickness reported by respondents\nacross different regions of the same country are even more\nlikely to vary and to be difficult to interpret (as noted by\nMcDade, 1999). In the present study, morbidity reports and\nbiochemical data were collected across a range of\nenvironments contrasting both in terms of pathogen\nexposure (related to lifestyle and risk factors) and health\ncare expectations (related to socio-economic milieu and\nuptake of health care). If one took the differences in\nmorbidity reports between rural and urban Nepali boys at\nface value, one would be tempted to conclude that\ninfectious burdens are unlikely to account for their\ndifferences in growth status (Todd et al. 1996). However,\nthe analysis of the biochemical evidence warrants a\ndifferent conclusion.\nThis study draws attention to the very high levels of ACT\nand of stunting in the rural Nepali population. It also\nconcludes that morbidity reports should be evaluated with\ncaution when comparing very different epidemiological\nand socio-ecological environments; such reports are best\ncorroborated with biochemical measures.\nAcknowledgements\nThe research was facilitated by Tribhuvan University,\nKathmandu, and CWIN.\nReferences\nBaker R (1998) Negotiating identities: A study of the lives of\nstreet children in Nepal.
