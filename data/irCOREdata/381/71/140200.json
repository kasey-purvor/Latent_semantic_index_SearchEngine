INTRODUCTION\nCemented carbides\u2014also known as hardmetals\u2014are a\ngroup of refractory composites in which a hard carbide phase\nis held in situ or \u201ccemented\u201d by a binding phase, typically\nCo, Ni, or Fe.1 In cemented carbides with a Co matrix, e.g.,\nWC\u2013Co, the hexagonal WC particles provide a high hard-\nness and strength, while the Co matrix, which forms a con-\ntinuous film around the WC particles, increases toughness\nand plasticity.1,2 The mechanical properties of WC\u2013Co hard-\nmetals are strongly dependent on both the WC particle\/\ncrystallite size and the Co matrix content; for example, hard-\nness and compressive strength both increase with either a\nreduction in Co content or increase in WC grain\/crystallite\nsize.\nThe high compressive strength of these materials,\ncoupled with a relatively high density and good toughness,\nmakes WC\u2013Co hardmetals particularly attractive for ammu-\nnition applications. They are well known for defeating\nceramic-faced armors where steel-cored projectiles would\notherwise fail.3,4 Consequently, cemented carbides have been\nused since the Second World War in such projectiles as the\n14.5 mm\u0002114 mm BS41 armor-piercing \u0001AP\u0002 round that\nwas fielded by the Soviet army. In the past few years the use\nof tungsten carbide cores in the manufacture of AP bullets\nhas become commonplace. This form of ammunition is rap-\nidly replacing the previous generation of steel-cored AP bul-\nlets. For example, United States forces have adopted the\nM993 and M995 tungsten carbide-cored AP rounds into gen-\neral use in the 7.62 and 5.56 mm calibers, respectively. Fur-\nther, 12.7 mm caliber rounds with tungsten carbide cores are\nrapidly being adopted by European armies as a way of up-\ngrading the effectiveness of AP bullets while using existing\nmachine gun systems. Therefore there is a requirement to\nunderstand the dynamic behavior of such materials.\nThere has been a limited study of the dynamic behavior\nof WC focused on ceramic \u0001hot pressed\u0002 WC,5,6 with a more\nextensive body of work studying the shock response of\nWC\u2013Co cermets.7\u201310 Data on WC\u2013Co with Co contents of\n5\u20136 wt % covering particle velocities up to 1820 m\/s have\nbeen presented and have shown typical Us\u2212Up and P\n\u2212V \/V0 relationships within this regime.\n7,8 Additionally\nGrady7 studied the response of a 3\u20134 wt % Ni matrix-based\nWC cermet extracted from a 14.5 mm AP \u0001BS-41\u0002 bullet\ncore. The Co-based cermet exhibited a Hugoniot elastic limit\n\u0001HEL\u0002 of around 4.1 GPa with the Ni-based cermet showing\nbroadly similar behavior, although no precise HEL was\nfound.7 The Ni-based cermet showed a spall strength of 3.6\nGPa, while that with a Co matrix showed a lower spall\nstrength of 2.8 GPa. An unusual three-stage shock rise was\nnoted within the cermet in all cases:7 \u00011\u0002 the elastic rise to\nthe HEL, \u00012\u0002 a plastic \u201cramp\u201d in stress after the HEL, and \u00013\u0002\na plastic rise to the Hugoniot stress. This unusual plastic\nramp was attributed to deformation hardening, although\nother potential causes including pressure hardening and void\ngeneration were considered. Similar behavior has also been\nobserved in WC ceramics,5,6 although here an alternate ex-\nplanation for the post-HEL ramp in the form of collapse of\npores within the WC \u0001at greater shock velocities the ramp\ntimescales decreased\u0002 was proposed.6\nNo lateral gauge studies on WC\u2013Co were found in the\nliterature; however, Millett et al.6 conducted plate impact\nexperiments on a WC ceramic to investigate lateral stress\nand shear strength. A decrease in shear strength behind the\nmain shock \u0001corresponding to an increase in lateral stress\u0002\nwas observed and attributed to plasticity due to dislocation\nmovement and generation.\nIn this study a WC\u2013Co cermet grade G13 was investi-\ngated over the velocity regime 199\u2013857 m\/s. A grain size\ndistribution of 2\u20134 \u0003m was quoted for the G13 WC\u2013Co,\nwhich was supplied in the form of ready polished disks of up\nto 65 mm diameter with a planarity of \u00045 \u0003m. The supplied\nG13 had a slightly higher Co composition than those consid-\nered in the literature7,8 at 8.5 wt %. The Us\u2212Up relationship\nis determined based on strain gauge data from a series of\na\u0002Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. Tel.: \u000544 \u00010\u0002 1793\n784192.

Additionally es-\ntimates of both the WC\u2013Co HEL and spall strength are made.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL\nLongitudinal and shear wave velocities were measured\nultrasonically using a Panametrics 5077PR pulse receiver in\nthe pulse-echo configuration and density was measured using\na Micrometrics AccuPyc 1330 gas pycnometer. Measured\nand subsequently calculated elastic properties of G13\nWC\u2013Co are shown in Table I.\nScanning electron micrographs of perpendicular sections\nthrough supplied G13 WC\u2013Co are shown in Fig. 1 and show\na typical hardmetal two-phase structure with no notable an-\nisotropy and a slightly larger than expected bimodal WC\ncrystallite\/grain size distribution of \u00041\u20137.5 \u0003m.\nEquation of state data were determined experimentally\nusing plate impact experiments11,13,14 conducted on a 5 m\nbarrel 50 mm diameter gas gun.12 WC\u2013Co disks were\nmounted together with a cover plate and a 12 mm thick\nbacking polymethylmethacrylate \u0001PMMA\u0002 block with two\nVishay Micro-Measurements type LM-SS-125CH-048 Man-\nganin strain gauges in between as shown in Fig. 2. The cover\nplate was included in order to provide protection to the front\nsurface gauge, with the material chosen to be that of the flyer\nin line with the impedance matching technique.8,14\nMylar thicknesses of 25\u2013100 \u0003m were employed to\ninsulate\/protect the Manganin gauges, and an epoxy adhesive\n\u0001Loctite\u2122 0151 Hysol Epoxi-Patch\u0002 with a similar shock\nimpedance to both the Mylar and the gauge assembly itself\nwas chosen for package assembly. The total separation of the\nfront and rear surface gauges was determined by measuring\nthe target thickness accurately before the experiment using a\nmicrometer and by making allowance for the thickness of\nMylar encapsulation in front\/behind the gauges as appropri-\nate. Wave velocities were then calculated from transit times\nfor the wave, which were measured based on initial wave\narrival at the front and back surface gauges successively. In\naddition, maximum\/minimum wave velocities about the\nmeasurement point for both gauges were determined and\nused in subsequent error calculations. At higher impact\nstresses several of the observed wave traces exhibited ramps\/\nchanges in gradient during the initial rise to a peak stress. In\nsuch cases the measured wave velocity therefore varied de-\npending on the position at which wave arrival was measured\nat the two gauges. Where such a change in gradient was\napparent, wave arrival was measured between corresponding\npoints on the two traces at the measured stress corresponding\nto the first change in gradient on either gauge.\nData recording using a 1 GHz oscilloscope was initiated\nby shorting of a pair of trigger pins located in a target ring\nused for target package mounting\u2014the entire arrangement\nwas subsequently fixed onto a barrel extension. All surfaces\nin contact with the target package or barrel were finished to a\nflat surface with a planarity of \u00065 \u0003m. Gun alignment shots\ncomprising a target of three ionization pins spaced across a\nCu disk undertaken during the course of this investigation\nconfirmed that these measures resulted in a misalignment\nconsistently \u00041.5 mrad s. A series of graphite pins was used\nto calculate the terminal velocity of the projectile. The target\nassembly, excluding the barrel extension, is shown schemati-\ncally in Fig. 3.\nBalancing and calibration of the gauges were undertaken\nfollowing Rosenberg et al.,13 which provided a ready ap-\nproach to scale measured changes in voltage with time re-\ncorded during the plate impact experiments to changes in\nstress within the Manganin gauges; and subsequent data in-\nterpretation following a slightly modified version of the im-\npedance matching technique.8,14,15 Essentially, the intercept\nbetween an inverted form of the known polynomial of the\nparticle velocity-pressure \u0001UP\u2212 P\u0002 Hugoniot of the flyer ma-\nTABLE I.

This was possible because, by definition, the par-\nticle velocity within the flyer, cover, and target materials was\nequivalent.\n\u00070US\u0001UP\u0001 \u2212 Vimpact\u0002 = AUP\u0001\n2\n\u2212 BUP\u0001 + C , \u00011\u0002\nwhere \u00070 is the density of the WC\u2013Co target, US is the mea-\nsured shock velocity in the WC\u2013Co target, UP\u0001 is the effective\nparticle velocity, Vimpact is the impact velocity of the projec-\ntile, and A, B, and C are the \u0001known\u0002 polynomial constants of\nthe UP\u2212 P Hugoniot for the flyer material.\nEquation \u00011\u0002 was then rewritten as a polynomial in UP\u0001\nand solved using a least-squares-fitting approach. Subse-\nquently, the calculated UP\u0001 value was converted to the actual\nparticle velocity in the WC\u2013Co target \u0001UP\u0002 by addition of the\nflyer impact velocity according to\nUP = UP\u0001 + Vimpact. \u00012\u0002\nLateral gauge shots employed a modified WC\u2013Co target sec-\ntioned and ground to a flatness of \u00065 \u0003m perpendicular to\nthe main WC\u2013Co impact faces with a Micro-Measurements\ntype J2M-SS-580SF-025 lateral gauge embedded 5 mm from\nthe impact face encapsulated in 25 \u0003m thick Mylar. This\narrangement is shown schematically in Fig. 4. Lateral traces\nwere interpreted using a modified form of the impedance\nmatching technique, developed by Rosenberg and Partom,16\nwhich was based on the assumption that the strain in a thin\n\u0001foil\u0002 laterally embedded gauge was equivalent to that of the\nsurrounding material. This approach was adapted to take ac-\ncount of both the elastic-plastic response of the Manganin\ngauge used17 as well as the pressure dependence of its re-\nsponse at stresses below its elastic limit.18 The configuration\nshown in Fig. 4 was typically assembled with a rear surface\nlongitudinal gauge insulated by a 25 \u0003m thick Mylar and\nretained in situ by a PMMA backing block. This second\ngauge provided time of arrival data for the shock enabling\nfurther Us\u2212Up data to be established in the course of the\nlateral gauge shots according to the impedance matching\ntechnique for longitudinal gauges set out previously. It\nshould also be noted that while for the longitudinal shots\ncover plates of the same material as the flyer were selected in\norder to provide protection for the gauge, for the lateral shots\nno cover plate was necessary as the gauges were positioned\nsufficiently far from the impact surface \u00015 mm\u0002 to survive the\ninitial impact. Consequently, for the lateral shots, the cover\nmaterial was treated for impedance matching purposes as\nWC\u2013Co.\nFlyer velocities in the range 199\u2013857 m\/s were investi-\ngated, inducing longitudinal stresses of 2.5\u201323.5 GPa in the\nWC\u2013Co. Concurrently, lateral stress evolution was investi-\ngated for impact velocities of 199\u2013656 m\/s.\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nA total of 15 shots, 8 using longitudinal gauges and 7\nusing either lateral gauges alone or combinations of lateral\/\nlongitudinal gauges, were undertaken. A summary of the ex-\nperimental conditions and key results from these tests is pre-\nsented in Table II. US\u2212UP data were extracted from both the\nlongitudinal shots and, in three cases, from targets incorpo-\nrating a lateral gauge to which a rear surface longitudinal\ngauge with PMMA backing was attached in order to allow\ncalculation of the transit time for the wave. In one case, for\nan impact velocity of 453 m\/s, uncertainty in the position of\nthe front lateral gauge following target assembly led to inde-\nterminate US\u2212UP data and consequently such data are not\nincluded either in Table II or the subsequently derived Hugo-\nniot. Additionally, in two cases for impact velocities of 541\nand 646 m\/s, rear surface gauge failure led to no US\u2212UP or\n\tX data being determined and such data are therefore not\nincluded in Table II. One other lateral shot was also under-\ntaken with no rear surface gauge. In this case no US\u2212UP or\n\tX data were directly measured, and consequently these data\nare not included for this shot in Table II. Instead, where \tx\nFIG. 3. \u0001Color online\u0002 Experimental setup for the plate impact studies.\nFIG. 4. \u0001Color online\u0002 Schematic showing location of lateral gauge within\nthe WC\u2013Co target.\n064916-3 Appleby-Thomas et al.

The\ninitial shock rise time was relatively slow at \u0005140 ns, attrib-\nuted to the thick Mylar protection experimentally found to be\nnecessary to prevent premature gauge failure. A constant\nmaximum stress was subsequently obtained before releases\nfrom the rear of the flyer led to gauge failure. Just before the\nshock began to ramp up a dip below zero stress was observed\nat \u0001a\u0002. This has been seen elsewhere and has been attributed\nto an increase in capacitance between the gauge and cover\nplate as the cover plate is accelerated toward the gauge.19\nNoise at \u0001b\u0002 and \u0001c\u0002 just before the maximum stress plateau\nappeared electrical in nature and was attributed to a capaci-\ntance effect between the cover plate and insulated gauge\ncaused by ionization of the propellant gas around the inci-\ndent flyer plate. Additionally the release appeared two-stage\nin nature with a presumed high-stress elastic region above\n\u0001d\u0002 and an elastic-plastic region below. However, no attempt\nwas made to extract WC\u2013Co specific information from this\nregion as it was noted that the apparent elastic-plastic release\nat \u0001d\u0002 may also be linked to the Manganin gauge response as\nwell as that of the WC\u2013Co target. Finally, gauge failure is\nobserved to occur at \u0001e\u0002.\nFor comparison, stress histories from both the front and\nback surface gauges for a higher velocity, Vimpact=644 m \/s,\nshot are presented in Fig. 6. An arrow has been included in\nFig. 6 showing the separation, \ntshock, between the two traces\nused to calculate the wave velocity \u0001based on the measured\ntarget thickness, as discussed previously\u0002 and, therefore, via\nthe impedance matching technique, the particle velocity in\nthe WC\u2013Co. Premature front gauge failure occurred due to\nsubstrate conduction as the stress approached 20 GPa. Here\nthe back surface stresses have been scaled to represent ap-\nproximately those in the WC\u2013Co target using\n\tWC-Co =\n1\n2\n\u0001ZWC-Co + ZPMMA\u0002\nZPMMA\n\tPMMA, \u00013\u0002\nwhere \tWC-Co is the stress in the WC\u2013Co, \tPMMA is the stress\nin the PMMA, ZWC-Co is the impedance of the WC\u2013Co, and\nZPMMA is the impedance of the PMMA. In general, Z=\u00070Us,\nwhere \u00070 is the material density and Us is the wave velocity\nmeasured at the position shown in Fig. 6.\nTABLE II.

Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright, see http:\/\/jap.aip.org\/jap\/copyright.jsp\nThe use of Eq. 3 in Fig. 6 to calculate the maximum\nstress experienced by the WC\u2013Co from the lower PMMA\nstress confirmed that the peak stress exceeded the Manganin\nstrain gauge upper limit of \u000520 GPa explaining the front\ngauge failure. The rear surface trace exhibits three distinct\nregions during the initial rise to the maximum stress each\nseparated by a change in gradient. These comprised \u00011\u0002 an\ninitial purely elastic linear ramp up to the HEL of WC\u2013Co,\n\u00012\u0002 an elastic-plastic response up to a stress ~8 GPa where\nthe gradient was observed to change, and \u00013\u0002 a \u201cramped\u201d\nplastic region up to the maximum recorded stress. The final\nplastic ramp up to a full shock apparent for similar grades of\nWC\u2013Co elsewhere7 was not present on any of the recorded\ntraces. As shown later in this paper this was because all tests\nundertaken lie on either the purely elastic or the plastic ramp\nregimes. Similar ramped regions immediately following the\nHEL were observed by Grady7 and attributed to elastic-\nplastic hardening behavior arising from deformation harden-\ning \u0001compression of the WC particles\u0002. Figure 6 gave a\nWC\u2013Co HEL of \u00053.2 GPa and overall an average WC\u2013Co\nHEL of 3.3\u00010.2 GPa was determined. This is lower then\nthe HEL determined by Grady7 for a similar WC\u2013Co grade.\nThis difference was attributed to the lower strength of the\nG13 WC\u2013Co, a product of its higher Co content \u00018.5% as\nopposed to 5.7%\u0002. The change in gradient just above the\nWC\u2013Co HEL in Fig. 6 is found to occur at \u00058 GPa. This is\napproximately equal to the HEL of WC ceramic.10 It is pro-\nposed that the presence of two different points of inflection\ncorresponding to the HEL values of both WC\u2013Co and WC\nmay be attributed to dispersion of the elastic wave within the\ncermet as the WC particles were compressed. Essentially\nhere the region between the HEL of WC\u2013Co and WC is\ninterpreted as a diffuse elastic limit, with the cermet reaching\nits elastic limit first, but with the WC particles remaining\nelastic up to \u00058 GPa.\nThe calculated Us\u2212Up relationship is presented in Fig. 7\nalong with additional data from the literature as appropriate.\nThe error bars are based on the assessed accuracy of the\nmeasured wave velocities. As previously discussed, the mea-\nsured wave velocities depended on the position at which\n\ntshock \u0001shown in Fig. 6\u0002 was assessed. Maximum\/minimum\nlikely wave velocities were measured by altering the position\nat which wave arrival was assumed to occur on each gauge.\nFrom Eq. \u00011\u0002 it was observed that the calculated particle\nvelocities depended on the measured wave velocities. Con-\nsequently, in each case, the assessed range of possible wave\nvelocities was used to calculate maximum\/minimum values\nfor the particle velocity. These calculations are reflected in\nthe error bars included on the experimental data in Fig. 7.\nThe Us\u2212Up relationship in Fig. 7 is divided into three\nsections, an initial constant Us region, which appears entirely\nelastic up to Up=0.03 mm \/\u0003s, and then two sections above\/\nbelow Up=0.37 mm \/\u0003s, with positive and negative gradi-\nents, respectively. In the two sloped regions the best fit takes\nthe general form shown in Eq. \u00014\u0002, with the intercepts ap-\nproximating the measured sound velocities.\nUs = c0 + SUp, \u00014\u0002\nwhere, in general, c0 is the target material sound speed and S\nis a shock parameter.\nFurther, the particle velocity at the HEL of both WC\u2013Co\nand WC was calculated using14\nUp =\n\tHEL\n\u0006\u0007E\n, \u00015\u0002\nwhere E is Young\u2019s modulus \u0001600.1 GPa for G13 WC\u2013Co\u0002.\nThe observed trilinear Us\u2212Up relationship comprises an\ninitial elastic response up to Up=0.03 mm \/\u0003s, followed by\na ramped region, which intercepts the principal WC\u2013Co\nHugoniot determined by Marsh8 between the two sloped\nlines of best fit in Fig. 7 \u0001Up=0.37 mm \/\u0003s and Us\n=5.62 mm \/\u0003s\u0002. None of the experimental datapoints from\nthis work lie on the principal Hugoniot, instead all lie within\neither the initial elastic region or the subsequent \u0001plastic\u0002\nramped region. This explains the lack of a final plastic rise to\na shock in any recorded trace \u0001for example, Fig. 6\u0002. Given a\nWC\u2013Co HEL of 3.3 GPa, the maximum particle velocity at\nwhich G13 WC\u2013Co remains elastic was estimated from Eq.\n\u00015\u0002 as 0.035 mm \/\u0003s \u0001as the wave is still elastic up to the\nHEL\u0002. This is plotted in Fig. 7 and is in good agreement with\nthe intercept between the elastic and plastic regions \u0001e.g.,\nUp=0.03 mm \/\u0003s\u0002.\nHowever, observation of the experimental data in Fig. 7\nshowed that a good fit through the plastic data could also be\nachieved if an intercept with the purely elastic regime of\nUp=0.08 mm \/\u0003s was assumed. Using literature data for\nWC,6,10 combined with Eq. \u00015\u0002, the particle velocity at the\nHEL of pure WC was calculated as 0.08 mm \/\u0003s \u0001plotted in\nFig. 7\u0002. This ties in well with the observed diffuse elastic\nlimit running between the HEL values of WC\u2013Co and WC\napparent in the rear surface trace in Fig. 6. This gives cre-\ndence to the suggestion that rather than a precise elastic\nlimit, the presence of the WC particles leads to an effective\ndispersion of the elastic wave, with the WC element of the\ncermet continuing to behave elastically beyond the elastic\nlimit of the cermet. This link between the elastic response\nand the composite nature of the WC\u2013Co cermet has been\nobserved elsewhere, e.g., by Klein et al.20 for TiC-steel sys-\ntems.\nWhile trilinear responses are not readily apparent in the\nliterature, the bilinear response seen in Fig. 7 above Up\nFIG. 7. \u0001Color online\u0002 Us\u2212Up relationship for G13 WC\u2013Co plus compara-\ntive results \u0001Refs. 6\u20138 and 10\u0002.\n064916-5 Appleby-Thomas et al.

Grady7 suggested\nthe existence of a ramp wave between the Hugoniot for\nWC\u2013Co and the calculated HEL, as illustrated schematically\nin Fig. 7. However, Grady7 was only able to obtain a small\nnumber of datapoints and only one \u0001for WC\u2013Ni\u0002 showed\nsignificant deviation from the main Hugoniot. Therefore the\nprecise nature of this ramp wave is open to interpretation.\nTwo different mechanisms have been proposed in the litera-\nture to explain bilinear behavior: \u0001a\u0002 the completion of a\nshock induced phase change with the change initially lower-\ning the bulk sound speed,21 and \u0001b\u0002 the stress dependence of\nthe elastic precursor velocity leading to its measurement in-\nstead of the main shock for \t\u0004\tHEL \u0001Ref. 22\u0002 \u0001TiB2\u0002. Ad-\nditionally, Zhang et al.22 suggested that a two-stage Hugoniot\nis indicative of retention of material shear strength in the\nplastic region. If a deformation hardening effect \u0001compres-\nsion of the WC particles\u0002 occurred, which reached saturation\nat Up=0.37 mm \/\u0003s, then some credence might be given to\nmechanism \u0001a\u0002. It proved difficult to discern the HEL on rear\nsurface traces at impact velocities \u0004450 m \/s even where\nfront surface gauge failure indicated \t\u000b\tHEL. It is therefore\npossible that at least part of the ramp from the HEL of\nWC\u2013Co back to the principal Hugoniot in Fig. 7 may be\nattributed to measurement of the elastic precursor. Addition-\nally, the apparent dispersion of the elastic wave alluded to in\nFigs. 6 and 7 implies that an elastic precursor would still\nhave been dominant up to at least Up=0.08 mm \/\u0003s \u0001corre-\nsponding to the HEL of pure WC\u0002.6,10,14 However, at higher\nvelocities, once both the G13 WC\u2013Co and pure WC HELs\nbecome apparent the continued bilinear nature of the Us\n\u2212Up relationship above the HEL of WC cannot be fully ex-\nplained. Klein et al.20 found that the dynamic response of the\nTiC-steel system was largely dependent on the interaction\nbetween the two constituent phases. At impact stresses above\nthe HEL shock compression resulted in the TiC ceramic be-\ning entirely crushed \u0001a phenomenon also alluded to by\nMeyers14\u0002, reducing the effective cross-sectional area of the\ntargets to that of the metal matrix. In the case of WC\u2013Co,\ninverse behavior might be expected as failure has been\nshown to occur in the Co matrix meaning that the response\nof the \u0001effectively sintered\u0002 WC particles is likely to domi-\nnate at higher impact velocities. This idea of a dynamic re-\nsponse arising from the interplay of the two phases, with the\nresponse of the WC particles becoming dominant at higher\nimpact velocities, appears plausible. It ties in well with the\nobserved dispersion of the elastic limit in Figs. 6 and 7 be-\ntween those of WC\u2013Co and pure WC and represents another\npossible explanation for the observed nonelastic bilinear be-\nhavior.\nA distinct unloading\/reloading signal was apparent on\nthe rear surface gauge of the 857 m\/s shot as shown in Fig. 8.\nThis represented a differential of 4.38 GPa, a value in good\nagreement with the measured spall strength values of 2.8\u20133.5\nGPa for similar grades of WC\u2013Co, namely, WC\u2013Ni and\nWC\u2013Co recorded elsewhere.7 Therefore, given the high\nparticle\/shock velocity, the relatively high thickness of the\ntarget \u000110.36 mm as compared to \u00056.2 mm in most cases\u0002,\nand the good agreement with literature data, this signal was\nassumed to represent dynamic spall of the G13 WC\u2013Co.7,21\nLateral gauge traces for the five lateral experiments un-\ndertaken are shown in Fig. 9. The relatively slow rise times\nof \f300 ns are typical and have been observed elsewhere.18\nA ramp\/change in gradient is apparent in all traces during the\nshock arrival. This is a feature observed in similar results for\nmonolithic WC,6 where it was attributed to the collapse of\nsurface pores during shock arrival. Millett et al.6 also pro-\nposed that the rate at which this hardening behavior \u0001e.g.,\npore collapse\u0002 occurs should increase with shock velocity.\nThey linked this phenomenon to observed decreases in the\nduration and accompanying increases in gradient of the ini-\ntial ramp in monolithic WC. The gradient of the ramp ob-\nserved at the beginning of the traces shown in Fig. 9 is also\nseen to increase with impact velocity while the duration of\nthe ramp is seen to simultaneously decrease. Given the ob-\nservations by Millett et al.6 it therefore seems reasonable to\nconclude, based on the behavior of the ramp observed at the\nbeginning of the lateral gauge traces, that some hardening\nbehavior is occurring with increased impact stress. Unlike\nthe longitudinal case in Fig. 5, this is followed by two dif-\nferent effects: \u00011\u0002 at lower impact velocities a reduction in\nstress, and \u00012\u0002 at higher velocities a steady increase in stress;\nin both cases this continues until either gauge failure when\n\tx\f\u000520 GPa or a release ends the pulse.\nMaximum shear strength, \r, is related to the longitudinal\nstress \u0001\tx\u0002 and the transverse stress \u0001\ty\u0002 by\nFIG. 8.

This has been shown in\nFigs. 5 and 6 to remain constant for the duration of the shock\n\u0001e.g., once the Hugoniot stress is reached\u0002. Consequently,\nfrom Eq. \u00016\u0002, the steady increase in magnitude of \ty behind\nthe shock in Fig. 9 visible once the shock had ramped up\nimplied a reduction in shear strength. Following the arrival\nof the main shock front maximum shear strength values at\nlocations \u00011\u0002 and \u00012\u0002 for each trace in Fig. 9 \u0001indicated by\ncircles representing minimum\/maximum lateral stresses, re-\nspectively, with data included for point \u00012\u0002 subject to gauge\nsurvival\u0002 were calculated and are presented in Fig. 10.

The movement of the datapoints from locations \u00011\u0002\nand \u00012\u0002 below the elastic prediction with increasing stress\nindicates the onset of plastic deformation. Therefore, the in-\ntersection between the elastic prediction and the measured\nshear strength data should be the point of departure from the\nelastic curve, namely, the HEL. While no data from locations\n\u00011\u0002 or \u00012\u0002 are lower than the HEL, it is apparent that best-fit\nlines through these data in Fig. 9 \u0001neither line is included for\nclarity\u0002 would lie either at or just below the HEL. E.g., if the\nHEL is included as a datapoint, the intercepts with the elastic\nprediction for the data from both locations \u00011\u0002 and \u00012\u0002 would\nbe at \tx=2.48 and 3.41 GPa, respectively. Nonetheless, de-\nspite the fact that the intercept from point \u00011\u0002 lies outside the\nerror margin of the measured HEL, the data from both loca-\ntions that sit on the elastic prediction confirm the order of\nmagnitude of G13\u2019s HEL, thereby increasing confidence in\nthe measured value. Additionally, slight evidence of the re-\nduction in shear strength behind the shock previously de-\nscribed is highlighted by the tendency of the points sampled\nat location \u00012\u0002 in Fig. 9 to stray below those from location \u00011\u0002\nwith increasing impact stress. However, insufficient data at\nhigher stresses exist to quantify this effect.\nSimilar results for monolithic WC \u0001Ref. 6\u0002 were attrib-\nuted to plasticity in the target material as the shock wave\nprogressed increasing lateral stress and therefore acting to\nreduce shear strength. In particular, plastic deformation was\nfavored over an alternate explanation of the coalescence of\ncracks formed at the front of the shock leading to a reduction\nin shear strength \u0003and therefore from Eq. \u00016\u0002 an increase in\nlateral stress\u0004 behind due to the presence of such weakening\nphenomenon below the HEL of WC. This was accounted for\nby the realization that the HEL represents an average stress\nacross all crystallographic directions meaning that in the\ncomplex ordered hcp structure of WC yielding of a propor-\ntion of grains orientated favorably in one direction below the\nHEL would be possible. This argument was used to justify\nthe suggestion that the observed reduction in shear strength\nbehind the shock both in this region and above the HEL was\nattributable to plastic deformation.6 While the lateral gauge\ntraces shown in Fig. 9 have a similar form to those reported\nelsewhere,6,15 recent work by Winter and Harris23 has sug-\ngested that a modification of both the explanation for the\nobserved reduction in shear strength and the interpretation of\nlateral gauge results is required. Simulations of plate impact\nexperiments were used to investigate the propagation of\nshocks through both a so-called matrix material and a matrix\nmaterial with an embedded fluid layer \u0001analogous to an en-\ncapsulated gauge\u0002. These showed that the presence of a fluid\nlayer leads to significant modifications of the nature of the\nshock front, with the shock in the fluid layer moving at a\ndifferent velocity to the surrounding matrix. When the shock\nmoves faster in the fluid layer a continual rise in lateral\ngauge stress until release results, while when this shock lags\nthe matrix shock front an initial ramp to a peak followed by\na steady decrease in magnitude to release is observed. The\nresults of these models are consistent with the experimental\ndata in Fig. 9 if it is assumed that the shock moves more\nslowly through the encapsulated gauge layer than the sur-\nrounding WC\u2013Co at lower stresses and faster at higher\nstresses. Such stress dependence was indeed noted by Winter\nand Harris for Ta.23 Recent work by Winter et al.24 has at-\ntempted to confirm this result by comparison to experiments\nthat involved measurements independent of lateral gauge re-\nsponses. The AWE heterodyne velocimetry \u0001Het-V\u0002 tech-\nnique was employed to investigate the recession velocity\n\u0001which is directly proportional to particle velocity\u0002 at two\ndifferent points, one central to the impact axis and one fur-\nther out, on the rear surface of both a Ta and a steel target\nfollowing impact with Cu flyers at \u0005300 m \/s. In each case,\nthe target was assembled into two halves joined together by\nan intermediate 100 \u0003m thick Mylar central layer designed\nto simulate the presence of a lateral gauge package. The\nrecession velocity was found to vary significantly further\nfrom the central encapsulation layer, implying that the pres-\nence of this layer had modified the induced shock.

It is also important to\npoint out that, while their results have been established over\na number of years, much of the work on lateral\ngauges6,15,18,25 comes from a selected group within the shock\nphysics community who have investigated this area. It is\nonly recently that this fundamental work has encouraged\nwider elements of the community to begin to turn their at-\ntention to this important field leading to possible alternative\nexplanations for the observed lateral gauge response. There-\nfore care should be taken in lateral gauge interpretation\u2014\nparticularly in relation to inference of any strengthening ef-\nfects.\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\nThe shock response of G13 WC\u2013Co has been studied\nusing plate impact experiments at impact velocities in the\nrange 199\u2013857 m\/s. Both longitudinal and lateral gauge\nshots were undertaken and comparison made to previous\ndata for similar grades of cemented WC. G13 WC\u2013Co has\nbeen found to exhibit a Us\u2212Up relationship with an initial\nelastic region extending beyond the particle velocity associ-\nated with the HEL of WC\u2013Co followed by a negative gradi-\nent in the region 0.03 mm \/\u0003s\u0006Up\u00060.36 mm \/\u0003s. It was\nsuggested that the initial elastic regime likely extends above\nthat of WC\u2013Co due to the composite nature of WC\u2013Co, with\nelastic waves continuing to propagate through the WC phase.\nThe negative ramped region was partially attributed to detec-\ntion of the elastic precursor, which had a higher velocity in\nthis regime. However, the continued negative gradient of the\nHugoniot after the HEL values of both G13 WC\u2013Co and\npure WC were detected meant that another explanation was\nrequired. Given that the elastic limit appeared to range from\nthat of WC\u2013Co to that of the WC phase only, it was proposed\nthat a mechanism such as deformation hardening of the WC\nparticles, which reached saturation at Up=0.37 mm \/\u0003s\nwhere the principal Hugoniot was rejoined, might be a rea-\nsonable alternative explanation. A three-stage profile was ob-\nserved in longitudinal stress gauge traces consisting of an\ninitial elastic rise to the HEL of G13 WC\u2013Co followed by a\nrise to a point of inflection, which was shown to correspond\nto the HEL of pure WC, and finally a plastic ramp up to a\nmaximum stress. The lack of a final plastic rise exhibited for\nsimilar WC\u2013Co cermets in the literature was attributed to the\nfact that impact stresses were not high enough to cause the\nshock to overtake the elastic precursor. This was confirmed\nby the experimentally derived Us\u2212Up relationship, which\nclearly showed that all experimental datapoints lie on either\nthe initial elastic or intermediate plastic regimes. The plastic\nramped behavior was tentatively linked to deformation hard-\nening as the Co matrix was compressed. An average G13\nWC\u2013Co HEL of 3.3\u00010.2 GPa was calculated, backed by\nestimates from the measured shear strength. This was\nslightly lower than reported elsewhere for WC\u20135Co, a factor\nattributed to the relatively high Co content of G13 WC\u2013Co.\nSpall strength was found to be 4.38 GPa, around 50% higher\nthan in WC\u20135Co grades \u0001again, it was suggested that this\nwas linked to the Co content\u2014it is postulated that a higher\nCo content led to a less brittle structure\u0002.\nLateral gauge results have, to the authors\u2019 knowledge,\nnot been previously reported for WC\u2013Co and showed a num-\nber of interesting features. A ramp during the initial rise of\nthe shock and an apparent weakening phenomenon over the\nduration of the shock were both observed. While recent work\ninvestigating the lateral gauge approach has suggested that\nthe latter effect may be an artifact of sample preparation, a\nlarge body of lateral gauge results for other materials \u0001albeit\nlargely produced by a similar set of workers who have pre-\nviously worked to ignite interest in this field\u0002 combined with\nthe strong nature of WC\u2013Co suggests that this increase in\nlateral stress\/decrease in shear strength arises due to plastic\ndeformation behind the shock. The initial ramp may be at-\ntributed to the arrival of an elastic precursor or possibly to\npressure hardening effects. It is also possible that the rela-\ntively lazy rise times exhibited by the lateral gauge traces are\na feature of the composite nature of WC\u2013Co, with the shock\nwave a superposition of those in the WC itself and the Co\nmatrix. Lateral stresses have been used to establish the stress\ndependence of the shear strength of G13 WC\u2013Co, which is\nobserved to vary approximately linearly with impact stress.\nThis increase continues beyond the HEL, but with a lower\ngradient, providing evidence for both maintenance of\nstrength and confirming the occurrence of plastic deforma-\ntion.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis research has been funded by the Dutch Ministry of\nDefense, partly through the Research Program \u201cV518-\nMunitions and Weapons Effects.\u201d\n1E.
