This paper reports a cost-utility analysis \nundertaken from the perspective of the UK National Health Service (NHS) of \nsupplementation versus no supplementation.   \n \nMethods \nDesign \nDetails of the design of the RCT are available elsewhere.9 In brief this was a \npragmatic randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.  Nine hundred and ten \nparticipants were recruited from six general practices in Grampian, Scotland, \n 5\nbetween February and December 2002 and randomised to either placebo (n = 454) or \na multivitamin and multimineral supplement (n = 456) and were followed up for 12 \nmonths. Of these 32 withdrew from the study (18 placebo and 14 supplement).  \nFurthermore, 77 stopped taking the tablets but did not withdraw from the trial (39 \nplacebo, 38 supplement).   \n \nA detailed description of the clinical outcomes are reported elsewhere.9 All people \naged 65 years and over were eligible unless their general practitioners (GPs) \nconsidered them too unwell to participate. Participants were excluded if they had \nused oral mineral, vitamin or fish oil supplements in the previous three months (one \nmonth in the case of water soluble vitamins only), or vitamin B12 injection in the last \nthree months. Written informed consent was collected from participants and the \nGrampian Research Ethics Committee gave approval for the study. Participants were \nrandomised to one tablet daily of either a commercially available multivitamin and \nmultimineral supplement (800mcg vitamin A, 60mg vitamin C, 5mcg vitamin D, \n10mg vitamin E, 1.4mg thiamin, 1.6mg riboflavin, 18mg niacin, 6mg pantothenic \nacid, 2mg pyridoxine, 1mcg vitamin B12, 200mcg folic acid, 14mg iron, 150mcg \niodine, 0.75mg copper, 15mg zinc, 1mg manganese) or matching placebo.   \n \nMeasurement of costs \nEstimation of NHS resource use \nIn over 94% of cases the use of health services resources in primary care was \ncollected principally from a review of primary care notes by a member of the trial \nteam (AM or AS) using a data abstraction form linked to a Microsoft Access \ndatabaseTM. These data were supplemented with participant information elicited \nfrom a patient diary when detailed information was provided (e.g. the participant \n 6\ngave exact details of an antibiotic prescription received from their GP not detailed in \nthe primary care notes), and for the few cases where the health authority had \nremoved the primary care notes of the participants who had died. The data collected \nfrom primary care records related to the number and type of antibiotic prescriptions \nin primary care (and total number of days that antibiotics were prescribed); number \nof primary care contacts; number of hospital admissions (in total and those related to \ninfection); number of days in hospital with infection; total number and number of \ninfection-related outpatient visits; adverse events reported by participants; \ncompliance with trial medication (from monthly diary report in all participants and \ntablet count at six and twelve months in a random sample of 10% of participants).  \nHospital data were obtained from computerised patient administration systems, \nhospital and primary care notes.   \n \nAll analyses of outcomes including the economic evaluation were conducted on an \nintention to treat basis. Table 1 describes the main elements of resource use in the \ntrial. \n \nDerivation of costs \nAverage unit costs of each aspect of resource use were obtained from reliable and \nwidely used published sources for inpatient and day case admissions, outpatient and \nprimary care contacts and antibiotic use.10-13 The cost of the multivitamin and \nmultimineral supplement was based on the purchase cost.  Costs were derived using \nunit costs for 2003 UK \u00a3 sterling. Data describing the resource utilisation of \nparticipants were combined with estimates of unit costs for each of the areas of \nmanagement considered. This allowed estimation of total cost for each participant, as \nwell as the average cost for each area of resource utilisation and average total cost. \n 7\nAs unit costs differ between, for example type and place of contact, the estimates of \nresource utilisation used for the estimation of cost were more disaggregated than \nthose used in the analysis described above. The main unit costs used in the analysis \nare reported in Table 1. \n \nMissing cost data were rare (about 0.5%) and assumed to be missing completely at \nrandom. The incremental (difference) in mean cost between groups was based on an \nanalysis of covariance adjusting for the factors used in minimisation (i.e. treatment, \ngender, age 74-84y, age 85y and above, and residence type).   \n \nDerivation of Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) \nThe health outcomes of the economic evaluation were expressed in terms of quality \nadjusted life years (QALYs); other clinical endpoints are reported in the main trial \nreport.9  QALYs have been used in order to reflect the effect of supplementation on \nan individual\u2019s health related quality of life. QALYs were estimated from the \nparticipant\u2019s responses to the EuroQol (EQ-5D) questionnaire collected at baseline, \nsix and 12 months. The EQ-5D is a generic measure of health status that defines \nhealth in terms of five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain or \ndiscomfort, and anxiety or depression. Each of these dimensions has three levels: no, \nmoderate or extreme problems. The combinations of these dimensions and levels \nprovide 243 possible health states. The responses of participants were converted into \nutilities using a tariff scale derived from a sample of UK general public.14 The \napproach used to generate QALYs has been extensively validated and has recently \nbeen recommended for decision making by the National Institute for Health and \nClinical Excellence (NICE) UK.15 \n \n 8\nAs the number of missing QALY responses was less than 10%, missing data were \nassumed to be missing completely at random (that is non-responders do not differ \nsystematically from responders). An alternative approach was also adopted that \nimputed the missing data using the mean responses of those that did provide a \nresponse. The incremental QALYs between groups were based on analysis of \ncovariance, adjusting for the factors used in minimisation (i.e. treatment, gender, age \n74-84, age 85 and above, and residence type), and EQ-5D baseline scores.   \n \nAssessment of cost-effectiveness \nData reported as mean costs for both cases and controls were derived for each item \nof resource use and then compared using unpaired t-tests. Using the estimates of \nincremental cost and QALYs, the incremental cost per QALY ratio (ICER) was \nestimated to assess the likelihood of the intervention being more cost effective. \nDecisions about the acceptability of a technology as an effective use of NHS \nresources are based primarily on the cost-effectiveness estimate of below an ICER of \n\u00a320,000 per QALY.15 As the data were not normally distributed non-parametric \nbootstrapping was used to estimate credible limits around the difference in cost for \neach area of resource use, mean total cost, and mean QALYs.16 No discounting of \ncosts and effects was performed, as the time horizon was only one year.   \n \nSensitivity analysis \nSensitivity analysis is necessary to assess the robustness of the qualitative conclusion \nand identify where areas where research needed to more precisely estimate the \nvalues of those variables to which the result is sensitive.17 The variables that were \nconsidered uncertain in this study related to the cost of the different services used.  \n 9\nTherefore one-way sensitivity analysis was conducted using plausible variations in \nthe cost of inpatient and outpatient services.   \n \nResults \nDescription of the participants (Table 2) \nThe median age of intervention and placebo groups was 72 and 71 years respectively. \nFour percent of participants were aged 85 years or older, 3% lived in nursing homes. \nMore than half took three or more different drugs daily, 30% had heart disorders, \n19% had chest disorders and 29% were at risk of either iron, folate, vitamin C or \nvitamin D deficiency. \n \nThe supplemented group had 150 hospital admissions during the trial, of which 22 \nwere for the treatment of infection. The figures for the placebo group were 125 and \n23, respectively.  The differences between groups were not statistically significant (P \n> 0.05).9  \n \nCosts \nThe summary of the mean cost per patient of the two interventions is presented in \nTable 3. This table summarises both resource use and costs and shows that the main \ndeterminant of incremental cost was the cost of the supplements. The mean total cost \nper patient in the multivitamin and multimineral supplement arm was \u00a390 (standard \ndeviation (SD) \u00a3155, median \u00a338) and of the placebo arm \u00a375 (SD \u00a3142, median \u00a321). \nThe difference in mean cost was \u00a315 (95% CI -\u00a34 to \u00a335).   \n \n 10\nQuality-adjusted life years \nTable 4 reports the EQ-5D scores for each arm of the trial at baseline, six and 12 \nmonths. Also reported are the differences between arms in EQ-5D score at six and \ntwelve months.  From these data it was estimated that the mean QALYs were 0.771 \n(SD 0.22, median 0.796) for the multivitamin and multimineral supplement arm and \n0.789 (SD 0.20, median 0.796) for the placebo arm.  The mean difference in QALYs \nafter adjusting for minimisation and baseline EQ-5D scores was \u20130.018 (95% CI \u20130.04 \nto 0.002) i.e. the placebo arm was associated with more QALYs, although the \ndifference was not statistically significant. \n \nEstimation of cost-effectiveness \nIn terms of mean incremental cost per QALY the placebo intervention was dominant \n(less costly and at least as effective). Furthermore, the results of the bootstrapping \nexercise indicated that it was highly unlikely (1% likelihood) that supplements could \nprovide additional benefits at a price considered affordable by society.  \n \nSensitivity analysis \nThe total costs were derived in several ways: by imputing the missing costs, \nincluding all outpatient and in-patient costs. Sensitivity analyses were carried out for \noutpatient service costs included the costs of day cases and accident and emergency \nvisits. The inpatient costs were also calculated based upon all hospital admissions \nand imputed speciality costs. These results were not sensitive to any of the changes \naround costs made in the sensitivity analyses performed.  \n \n 11\nDiscussion \nThe use of a multivitamin and multimineral supplement, similar to many of the \nproducts available over the counter, is unlikely to be cost-effective in this population \nfor the UK. This conclusion was not affected by any of the sensitivity analyses \nperformed or the inclusion of a stochastic analysis of costs and QALYs. This latter \napproach has been advocated in situations where no difference in outcomes has been \ndetected to quantify the likelihood that a more costly intervention could also be more \neffective.15 In our situation this likelihood was found to be very low (estimated at \n1%). Interventions with a cost per QALY of \u00a320,000 are generally recommended for \nuse in the UK NHS. Multivitamin and multimineral supplementation is highly \nunlikely to meet this criterion.   \n \nThe trial population is representative of the elderly population living in the \ncommunity but included very few people aged 85 years or over or living in nursing \nhomes, many of whom may be of higher risk of nutritional deficit.18 However, people \nalready taking supplements were also excluded and these people have been shown \nto have healthier diets.17   \n \nThe method used to elicit QALYs might have failed to capture some beneficial aspect \nof multivitamin and multimineral supplementation. However, there appeared to be \nno evidence of a difference when health was measured using the SF-12 nor in the \nnumber of infection days per person.9 These results are in concordance with those \nfrom similar trials6,8 although some evidence of borderline effectiveness has been \nreported.19,20 There was also a high proportion of people with zero costs in each \nsection as resource utilisation was quite low. \n \n 12\nConclusions \nIn conclusion, regular use of commonly available multivitamin and multimineral \nsupplements by older people living in the community not already taking \nsupplements is unlikely to be cost-effective. It is unclear whether this conclusion also \nholds for older people or those living in nursing home care. \n \n 13\nThe MAVIS Trial Group are: Dr Marion K Campbell PhD CStat, Prof Philip C \nHannaford MD FRCGP, Dr Geraldine McNeill PhD MB ChB, Dr Craig R Ramsay \nPhD BSc, Prof D Gwyn Seymour MD FRCP(UK),  Ms Kathryn Brownie, Ms Janice \nCruden, Ms Gladys McPherson, Ms Clare Robertson, Ms Joanne Warner. \n \nCollaborators in primary care: \nEllon Health Centre: Dr Alan Donaldson, Dr Ian MacKay, Dr Duncan McKerchar, Dr \nIan Simpson, Dr Martin Pucci, Dr Rosamund Bell, Dr Peter Brown, Dr Pilar Murphy, \nDr Huber Kam, Dr Anne Pearson, Ms Caroline Cumming  \nGilbert Road Medical Group: Dr John Corse, Dr Douglas Orr, Dr Linda Sandilands, \nDr James Scott, Dr Murdoch Shirreffs, Dr Sheena Tuttle, Dr Jane White, Dr Gordon \nWilson, Ms Jane Harvey, Ms Hilary Andrew \nInverurie Health Centre: Dr James Beattie, Dr James Black, Dr Victor Johnston, Dr \nDavid Hood, Dr Jacqueline MacDonald, Dr Sally Harkness, Dr Fiona McKay, Dr \nDavid Rutledge, Dr Fiona Baxter, Dr Gillian Brewis, Dr Richard Gordon, Ms Eunice \nConnon, Ms Wilma Hadden  \nMacduff Health Centre: Dr Iain Brooker, Dr Alison Barbour, Dr Pat Hoddinott, Mrs \nMurial Barclay, Ms Joy Thom \nPeterhead Health Centre: Prof Lewis Ritchie, Dr Kenneth Strachan, Dr Patricia \nDonaldson, Dr Joyce Robertson, Dr John Stout, Dr Ian Small, Dr Gregor Bruce, Dr \nDavid Kennedy, Dr Bruce Strachan, Dr Graham Strachan, Dr Dale Fenwick, Ms \nMichelle Bibby, Ms Ethel Wilson, Ms Fiona Begg  \nQueen\u2019s Road Medical Group: Dr Iain Duthie, Dr Geoff Clarke, Dr Fiona Garton, Dr \nEunice Connon, Dr Paul Davidson, Dr Iain Stirling, Dr Theresa Suttle, Dr Stuart \nWatson, Dr Belinda Porter, Ms Shona Nairn, Ms Loraine Horsburgh, Ms Rosie \nJamieson  \n \nData Monitoring and Safety Committee group members:  \nDr Adam Coldwells (chair), Dr Barbara Golden, Prof Lewis Ritchie. \n \nFunding\/Support: we are very grateful to The Health Foundation (formerly PPP \nHealthcare Medical Trust) for funding this trial (ISRCTN 66376460).
