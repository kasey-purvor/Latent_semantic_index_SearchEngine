Introduction\nPredictive geographical modelling has recently gained impor-\ntance as a tool for estimating habitat suitability within a\nwide range of biodiversity andmanagement studies, including\nstudies in the marine environment (Leverette, 2004; MacLeod,\n2005; Santos et al., 2006; Seoane et al., 2005). Parallel to the\ndevelopment of habitat suitability modelling, tracking pro-\ngrams for marine animals have developed rapidly at national,\nregional and international levels as a means to increase\nknowledge of animalmovements and habitat use in the ocean\n(Block et al., 2001; Bonfil et al., 2005; Lowry et al., 1998; Schaffer\net al., 2005; Tuck et al., 1999; Weimerskirch et al., 2002; Weng\net al., 2005). Due to their potentially better spatio-temporal\ncoverage of entire feeding ranges tracking data as compared\nto sightings and survey data may offer a less biased account\nof the distribution of wide-ranging species at sea. Undoubt-\nedly, the advancement of the technology of implanted or\nsatellite-linked data storage tags has improved the basis for\nprecise geo-location of tagged animals. In addition, the devel-\nopment of better integrated systems for obtaining, analyzing\nand mapping animal tracking data has improved the basis for\nlinking biological and physical data obtained from the tags\nwith physical oceanographical and marine biological data in\norder to better understand the habitat requirements ofmarine\nspecies (Block, 2005; Coyne and Godley, 2005). Unlike direct\nobservations or other human-inferred registrations of ani-\nmals, tracking data effectively have no false positives, i.e.\nquality-assured observations are all both accurate and valid\nand hence should be applicable to predictive presence-only\nmodels like PCA, EcologicalNiche FactorAnalysis (ENFA,Hirzel\net al., 2002), Bioclim (Farber and Kadmon, 2003), Genetic Algo-\nrithm for Rule-set Prediction (GARP, Stockwell and Peters,\n1999) andDomain (Carpenter et al., 1993). However,most anal-\nyses ofmarine habitat characteristics based onmarine tagging\ndata rely on isopleth-mapping in GIS and descriptive statis-\ntics using overlays of satellite sea surface temperatures, water\ndepth, ocean colour and fish distribution. There is a lack of\nquantitative applications of statistical models of habitat use,\nwhich is probably related to the limitations and properties of\ntracking information as presence-only data.\nEcological niche modelling as implemented in ENFA and\nGARP provides a means for modelling the dimensions of\nspecies\u2019 ecological niches, described as the quantity that gov-\nerns the limits of geographic distributions of species (Grinnell,\n1917;MacArthur, 1972), and offers considerably improved ana-U\nPlease cite this article in press as: Skov, H., et al., Application of habitat su\nanalyzing their feeding habitats, Ecol.

The ecological niche\nmodel for a species is measured in terms of marginality (the P\nRO\nOF\nhan at-sea surveys for habitat suitability modelling.\n\u00a9 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\ndifference between the mean of the distribution of the cells\nrepresenting species observations and the global cells) and\nspecialisation (the difference between the variance of the\nspecies and the global cells). The niche model can then be\nprojected onto a landscape to identify geographical regions\nthat have conditions inside and outside the species\u2019 niche,\nproducing a suitability map of a potential geographical dis-\ntribution for the species. These properties may make ENFA\nparticularly suitable for predicting habitats of marine ani-\nmals from tracking data, because the distribution and habitat\npreferences of marine predators are typically non-random,\ncharacterised by wide (often ocean-wide) ranges contrasting\nto localised concentrations at the scale of less than 100km,\noften less than 50km (Schneider and Duffy, 1985). ENFA has\nbeen applied successfully to presence-only data in terrestrial\n(Hortal et al., 2005; Zimmermann, 2004) and marine ecology\n(Leverette, 2004) and has also been applied successfully to ter-\nrestrial telemetry studies (Freer, 2004).\nHere we apply ENFA to tracking data for northern gannets\n(Morus bassanus) breeding at Bass Rock, south-east Scotland\nin 2003 and use satellite-derived hydrographical data and\nbathymetric data known to influence the distribution of pis-\ncivorous seabirds as ecological variables. As the distribution\nand feeding habitat of the northern gannet has been inten-\nsively studied by surveys in the western part of the North Sea,\nthe Bass Rock tracking data provided a unique opportunity\nto test the application of ENFA or other presence-only mod-\nels with tracking data for obtaining improved estimates of the\ndistribution and feeding habitats of marine animals.\n2. Methods\n2.1. Study area\nIn early July 2003, northern gannets were tagged on Bass\nRock, a major breeding colony of the species located at the\nentrance to the Firth of Forth, Scotland (Fig. 1). As the feed-\ning movements of the tagged birds extended up to 500km\nfrom Bass Rock, the study area comprised the entire North\nSea excluding the Skagerrak and the approaches to the English\nChannel. Summer conditions in the area immediately east of\nBass Rock are characterized by the discharge of riverine water\nthrough the Firth of Forth, mixed Scottish coastal water run-\nning southwards along the coast, a tidal mixing front located\napproximately 50kmeast of the British coast, seasonally strat-\nified Central North Sea water east of the tidal front andECOMOD 5012 1\u20139\nitability modelling to tracking data of marine animals as a means of\nel.2007.11.006\nrelatively shallowbanks locatedwithin 30\u201350kmof the colony. 90\nAnalyses of satellite trackingdata fromBassRock strongly sug- 91\ngest that individual northern gannets show site fidelity with 92\nsuccessive feeding trips to very similar locations (Hamer et 93\nDARTICLE IN PRESSECOMOD50121\u20139\necolog ical modell ing x x x ( 2 0 0 7 ) xxx\u2013xxx 3\nF\nt\na94\ni95\nw96\nr97\n298\nT99\nT100\nd101\no102\na103\nG104\na105\na106\np107\ne108\no109\na110\nt111\ni112\nt113\ni114\na115\nd116\no117\np118\nr119\no120\nr121\n2122\nE123\ng124\nv125\nl126\nf127\n(128\ng129\nTable 1 \u2013 List of eco-geographical variables\nParameter Unit\nDistance to Bass Rock Colony km\nDistance to land km\nBathymetry of sea floor m\nSlope of sea floor %\nEastern aspect of sea floor Range \u22121 to 1\nNorthern aspect of sea floor Range \u22121 to 1\nNorth Sea water mass Frequency range 0\u20131\nScottish coastal water mass Frequency range 0\u20131\n130\n131\n132\n133\n134\n135\n136\n137\n138\n139\n140\n141\n142\n143\n144\n145\n146\n147\n148\n149\n150\n151\n152\n153\n154\n155\n156\n157\n158\n159\n160\n161\n162\n163\n164\n165\n166\n167NC\nOR\nRE\nCT\nE\nig. 1 \u2013 Study area with bathymetry and an indication of\nhe gannetry at Bass Rock.\nl., 2001). The northern gannet is a piscivorous species, and\nt feeds predominantly on sandeel (Ammodytes spp.), together\nith pelagic species like mackerel (Scomber scombrus) and her-\ning (Clupea harengus) (Hamer et al., 2000).\n.2. Tracking data\nhe tracking data were collected by small GPS recorders (GPS-\nDlog, Earth & Ocean Technologies, Kiel, Germany) developed\nuring the IMPRESS project (Camphuysen, 2005) and deployed\nn 20 northern gannets during the chick rearing period in July\nnd early August 2003. Compared to satellite transmitters, the\nPS loggers provide greater accuracy and precision of records,\nnd sample positions at a much higher rate, thus providing\nhigher spatial resolution (Hamer et al., 2007). As the sam-\nling interval of the GPS logger was set to record positions\nvery three minutes, the device allowed for detailed routing\nf movements between the breeding colony and feeding areas\ns well as small-scale feedingmovements. In addition to posi-\nion, the loggers provided data on diving behaviour via an\nntegrated pressure sensor on a 2-s sampling interval, which\nogether with the high frequency of positional records made\nt possible to separate diving events from movements more\nccurately. A total of 217 diving eventswere selected formodel\nevelopment, which overlapped satellite night-time images\nf sea surface temperature. Diving events were computed as\nresence values and converted to a 1km\u00d71km raster file by\necording the sum of the diving events in each pixel. The res-\nlution of the diving events raster file was determined by the\nesolution of available satellite data (see below).\n.3. Model variables\nco-geographical variables consisted of geographic, topo-\nraphic and pelagic variables (Table 1). The geographic\nariableswere comprised of Euclidean distances to colony andU\nPlease cite this article in press as: Skov, H., et al., Application of habitat su\nanalyzing their feeding habitats, Ecol.

Eastern and northern aspects. The eastern and north-\nern aspects were calculated by taking the sine and cosine,\nrespectively, of the direction of the maximum slope values.\n2.3.2. Pelagic variables\nPelagic variables were discerned from the night-time NOAA\nAVHRR SST images, which were cloud-free for the area. A\ntotal of 17 cloud-free SST images overlapped the 217 div-\ning events by at least 3h, and were retained for analysis.\nRaw NOAA AVHRR satellite data (NOAA satellites 12, 14\nand 16) were obtained from the Dundee Satellite Receiv-\ning Station. To avoid skin-effects on the classification of\nsurface structures only night-time images were used. Calibra-\ntion followed algorithms described by NOAA\/NESDIS in the\nNOAA KLM User\u2019s Guide www2.ncdc.noaa.gov\/docs\/klm\/.

Water masses were classified using known\ntemperature ranges applying raster filter and re-classification\nprocedures. Frontal variables have generally been recognised\nfrom satellite images by boundaries between water masses\n(Fiedler and Bernard, 1987; Haney, 1989; Johannessen et al.,\n1989). In general, surface fronts are defined as regions of high\nhorizontal gradients (Mann and Lazier, 1991). Technically, sur-\nface fronts may be determined from SST images using edge\ndetection algorithms or slope analysis. However, these rou-\ntines were found to create unsatisfactory classifications of\nfrontal variables due to the relatively large amount of noise in\nthe SST images. Better results in terms of contiguous frontal\npatterns were generated using a gradient analysis followed\nby re-classification procedures to define frontal pixels on the\nbasis of threshold slope values. Following re-classification\nclusters of frontal pixelswere combined into contiguous struc-\ntures using group and re-classification procedures.\nThe following pelagic variables were classified: North Sea\nwater, Scottish coastal water, tidal shelf front and Forth River\nplume front. The variables were classified for each image-GPS\nlogger data pair and the frequency of each variable class was\nthen calculated for the entire data set. The calculation of aver-\nage frequency values took account of cloud cover by masking\nclouded areas as \u2018missing values\u2019. Frequencies of occurrence\nof water masses and fronts were coded using an index from 0\nto 1 with 1 being equivalent of a frequency of 100%.\n2.4. Model parameters\nSelected gannet diving event records were collated into a GIS\nlayer as the total number of presences per pixel. Normalisation\nof the eco-geographical GIS layers andmodelling of covariance\nmatrix, Ecological Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA) and habitat\nsuitability scores were carried out using a combination of\nArcGIS version 9.0, Biomapper version 3.0 and Idrisi version\n3.2. All topographic and hydrographical variables were nor-\nmalized through the \u2018Box\u2013Cox\u2019 algorithm (Sokal and Rohlf,\n1981), although ENFA is not considered very sensitive to the\nfrequency distribution of variables (Hirzel et al., 2002).\n2.4.1. Analysis of habitat marginality and specialisation\nSuitability functions were computed by comparing the distri-\nbution of the gannet in the multivariate oceanographic space\nencompassed by the recorded logger data with the multivari-\nate oceanographic space of the whole set of cells in the study\narea (Hirzel, 2001). On the basis of differences in the gannet\nand global \u2018space\u2019 with respect to their mean and variances,\nmarginality of gannet records was identified by differences to\nthe global mean and specialisation by a lower species vari-\nance than global variance. Thus, for large geographical areas\nlike the part of the North Sea studied here, ENFA approaches\nHutchinson\u2019s concept of ecological niche, defined as a hyper-\nvolume in themulti-dimensional space of ecological variables\nwithin which a species can maintain a viable populationU\nPlease cite this article in press as: Skov, H., et al., Application of habitat su\nanalyzing their feeding habitats, Ecol.

Several\nspecialisation factors were successively extracted from the\nn\u22121 residual dimensions, ensuring their orthogonality to the\nmarginality factor while maximising the ratio between the\nresidual variance of the background data and the variances\nof the gannet occurrences. A high specialisation indicates\nrestricted habitat usage compared to the range of conditions\nmeasured in the studiedpart of theNorth Sea. Obviously, ENFA\nis highly sensitive to the location and size of study area, and\nthis was one of the reasons for choosing a large study area\ncovering most of the North Sea.\n2.4.2. Habitat suitability modelling\nA habitat suitability index was computed on the basis of the\nmarginality factors and the first four specialisation factors, as\na high proportion of the total variance was explained by the\nfirst few factors, by comparison to a broken-stick distribution.\nThe habitat suitability algorithm allocated values to all grid\ncells in the study area, which were proportional to the dis-\ntance between their position and the position of the species\noptimum in factorial space.Weused the geometricmean algo-\nrithm for habitat suitability computation, as it allows for an\nimproved estimation of habitat suitability in situations with\nnon-unimodal distributions (Hirzel and Arlettaz, 2003). In this\nalgorithm habitat suitability is calculated as the geometric\nmean (\u0003G) of the weighted Euclidean distances (\u0131) from any\npoint P of the environmental space to all species points (Oi):\n\u0003G(P) = N\n\u221a\n\u0004\nN\ni = 1 \u0131(P, Oi).\nThemeandistances range from0 to infinity, and envelopes are\ndelineated encompassing hypervolumes with values below a\ncertain threshold. The habitat suitability index ranging from 0\nto 100 is calculated based on the number of observation points\nwithin each envelope.\n2.4.3. Evaluation\nAs no independent data were available, the predictive accu-\nracy of the suitability maps was evaluated by a Jack-knife\ncross-validation procedure following the method describedECOMOD 5012 1\u20139\nitability modelling to tracking data of marine animals as a means of\nel.2007.11.006\nby Boyce et al.

Results\npplication of ENFAprovided an overallmarginality ofm=1.99\nnd an overall specialization value of S=2.61, showing that\nass Rock gannets\u2019 feeding habitat in 2003 differed markedly\nrom themean conditions in the studied part of the North Sea.\nhe five factors retained accounted for 95% of the sum of the\nigenvalues (that is 100%of themarginalization and 95%of the\npecialization, Table 2). Marginality accounted for 17% of the\notal specialization, while the first two specialization factors\nccounted for 64% of the total specialization, indicating that\nannets are moderately restricted in the range of conditions\nhey utilize in the study area. It is also evident from the plot of\needing events in Fig. 2 that gannets use a wide range of areas\nn the North Sea for feeding.\nMarginality coefficients showed that gannets were linked\no the dynamic habitat variables and the distance to Bass Rock,\nhereas the topographic variables proved of little or no impor-\nance to gannet habitat (Table 2).

Discussion and conclusion\nhe ENFA model provided a confident delineation of a coher-\nnt, yet complex pattern of potential feeding habitat of\nannets from Bass Rock in 2003 based on the GPS logger data.\nlthough gannet feeding was recorded by the tagging data\nver a wide range of the North Sea, the modelled coherent\none of high habitat suitability values clearly fitted the loca-\nion of most fixes at the Forth River front and the Scottish\noastal water in proximity to Bass Rock and the entire area of\nhe tidal shelf front extending along the east of Scotland. The\nombination of a wide range of conditions and a tendency to\noncentrate in areas of specific oceanographic variables (i.e.\nhe tidal shelf front) may be typical for a piscivorous seabird.\nhis characteristic was further underlined by the combina-\nion of a low marginality factor and a relatively low tolerance\nalue. A wide range of seabird species have been recorded in\nlevated densities at tidal mixing fronts like this one. In the\northern hemisphere these variables seem to be of particu-\nar importance to sub-surface and pursuit diving species like\nanx shearwater (Puffinus puffinus), common guillemot (Uria\nalge) and razorbill Alca torda specialising on schooling fish\nBegg andReid, 1997;Decker andHunt, 1996; Kinder et al., 1983;\neopold, 1987; Schneider, 1982).\nThese results indicate that ecological niche analyses with\nracking data using marginality\/tolerance weighting have the\napacity to provide satisfactory and precise predictions of\nistribution patterns and feeding habitats of animals in the\ncean. Due to the better coverage of entire feeding ranges, the\nimited influence from historic factors (Leathwick, 1998) and\nack of bias from sampling design (Guisan and Zimmermann,\n000) tracking data may provide better data than surveys for\nabitat suitability modelling. Provided important habitat vari-\nbles are known and available for a large region in a raster\nIS format ENFA may be used to extract suitability gradients\nor marine species to much the same extent as for terrestrial\npecies.\nComputation of reliable specialisation and marginality\nactors in ENFA rely heavily on a representative sample of\nbservations (tracking data) in relation to the distribution of\nhe species. Accordingly, samples from populations located at\nhe extreme of the species\u2019 range may not reflect the typi-\nal diversity of habitat types and hence may provide habitat\nradients with limited scope for extrapolation. Even more\nmportantly, samples from a small part of the actual foraging\nange associated with a breeding colony may bias the output\nromENFA. The part of theNorth Seawhichwe included in the\nodel corresponds more or less to the entire feeding range\nf gannets from this colony (Hamer et al., 2001), and thus the\nredicted habitat suitability is likely to represent an un-biased\nstimate of the area-use by gannets breeding at Bass Rock in\n003.

Gradients at smaller\nscales generally reflect species-specific foraging and flocking\ndynamics (Schneider, 1990). Asmaximumforaging rangesmay\nbe very large and the animals have to travel large distances\nbetween feeding aggregations, the majority of tagging data\nmay reflect animals moving between feeding areas. As a con-\nsequence, post-processing of tagging data to retrieve data on\nfeeding activities is an important pre-requisite for modelling\nof habitat suitability on the basis of comparisons of global and\nspeciesmeans and standard variations of distributions of eco-\nvariables in themulti-dimensional space. As in this case study,\nthe application of high-frequency loggers allowed for identi-\nfication of potentially feeding birds on the basis of distances\nbetween individual fixes and diving depths.\nOne of the primary requirements for producing reliable\nhabitat suitabilitymodelling is the availability of input data on\neco-variables with high accuracy and resolution (Guisan and\nZimmermann, 2000). In the marine environment, most habi-\ntat modelling has been carried out using topographical and\nseascape characteristics rather than hydrodynamic variables\nas ecovariables (Leverette, 2004; MacLeod, 2005). Our results\nindicate that the inclusion of hydrodynamic variables poten-\ntially may increase the predictive power of ENFA models for\nmarine animals. Most of the topographic variables had only\na minor influence on the marginality factor. The use of SST\ndata allowed for the classification of surface hydrographical\nvariables and estimation of their frequencies at different loca-\ntions in the study area. However, hydrodynamicmodellingwill\nprovide an improved basis for resolving potentially important\ndynamic variables. Pycnocline depth and other structures of\nthe water column have been documented as important feed-\ning habitats to diving marine birds (Briggs et al., 1988; Haney,\n1991; Hunt and Harrison, 1990; Hunt et al., 1990; Skov and\nDurinck, 2000), hence characteristics of surface waters may\nbe insufficient to generate habitat characteristics for diving\npredators. In addition, modelling of frontal characteristics is\nnow possible at even very small scales (Langenberg, 1997), and\noften provide the only means to resolve the inherent short-\nterm variability of hydrographic structures like fronts.\nOther, more process-related variables such as prey con-\ncentrations, are often mentioned as potential predictors of\nmarine animal distributions (Williams et al., 2006). However,\nthe response pattern of seabirds to the distribution of prey\nindicates that seabirds often react to prey abundance at geo-\ngraphical scales considerably larger than that of a single\nprey patch, and the adaptations to predictable oceanographic\nstructures shown for several species indicate that optimisa-\ntion of prey detection in seabirds principally occurs within\nthe coarse-scale boundaries of the oceanographic structures\n(Fauchald et al., 1999). This is corroborated by the observa-\ntions of stronger seabird-prey associations in frontal regions\n(Decker and Hunt, 1996).\nBased on the above it seems that the biggest restric-\ntions regarding the potential application of ENFA models toECOMOD 5012 1\u20139\nitability modelling to tracking data of marine animals as a means of\nel.2007.11.006\nmarine tagging data are due to the nature of the sampled 453\ndata, for example in terms of size, behavioural characteris- 454\ntics and coverage in relation to the main distribution and 455\nforaging ranges of the species in question.

Yet, the\npotential of ENFA as a means to project habitat gradients to\nvast areas of ocean using logger data is great and promises\nto be able to greatly assist activities for mapping and mod-\nelling marine biodiversity, e.g. in relation to the delineation of\nmarine protected areas. In fact, the outline of the core habi-\ntat on the basis of an ENFA model based on 1 year of tagging\ndata has provided a clearer overview of the contiguous zone\nused by gannets from Bass Rock as compared to historic sur-\nvey data (Camphuysen, 2005, Fig. 6). ENFA\u2019s prime potential is\nthe use of tagging data by allowing extrapolation of data from\nregional to basin scale to allow for the identification of pri-\nority areas for further research and conservation. Similarly,\nENFA could also be used with other presence-only datasets,\nsuch as records in the international biodiversity databases\nand records of catches of particular species as a means for\npredictive modelling.\nAcknowledgements\nThe analyses formed part of the IMPRESS (Interactions\nbetween the Marine environment, PREdators, and prey: impli-\ncations for Sustainable Sandeel fisheries) project (EU contract\nQ5RS-2000-30864) focusing on assessments of sustainable\nsandeel (Ammodytidae) fisheries in the Firth of Forth, United\nKingdom.
