Temperatures rise\nand tempers fray; accusation and counter-accusation fly with as much\nimpunity as the academic arena can tolerate, which is actually a\nsubstantial amount; the term 'heated debate' is something of a polite\nunderstatement in a field where the search for 'objectivity' is as\napparently fruitless as it is held to be in other areas of intense conflict\nbetween proverbial bad neighbours or presumed 'family members', as\nin Rwanda, Northern Ireland or Israel-Palestine. Virtually everyone\nwho has written on Eritrea-Ethiopia laments the lack of objectivity in\nthe field, usually only to find themselves accused (sometimes with\njustification, sometimes less so) of the very same failing. One is either a\n'greater Ethiopianist', bitterly opposed to the aggressive, militaristic\nindependence which Eritrea had the temerity to achieve, or an 'Eritrean\nnationalist', bitterly opposed to the aggressive expansionism of the\nEthiopian empire-state. It is an apparently infinite debate characterised\nby polarisation, a discourse which has, at its very core, the old notion\nthat 'if you are not with us, you are against us'. The intellectual and\nliterary battlelines are as clearly drawn as any physical confrontation\nwitnessed by the region at any time over the past two or more\ngenerations. An unwavering adherence to the formula 'if you are not\nwith us, you are against us' has served many of the protagonists\ndiscussed in this paper very well in the crucible of armed struggle,\nsurvival in the face of seemingly overwhelming odds; it is less edifying in\nthe context of informed, scientific discussion and, actually, in the end\nachieves nothing.\nThe purpose of this brief prelude is not to herald a piece of\nunprecedented objectivity, as someone, somewhere, will regard it as\npartisan, whether in overall approach and argument, or simply in a tum\nof phrase here and arrangement of words there. Academic 'polar bears'\nRICHARD REID was Assistant Professor of History at the University of Asmara, Eritrea, from\n1997 to 2002 and now teaches at the University of Durham.

He is currently working on the history of warfare in eastern\nand north-eastern Mrica.\n370 ERITREAN RELATIONS WITH TIGRAY\nare a hypersensitive, prickly species, relentlessly scouring the scholarly\nhorizons for threats real or perceived, notoriously easily affronted by\nlanguage and its structure. While we must, of course, aspire to\nobjectivity-it would be irresponsible, at the very least, not to-there\nseems little point in actually claiming it publicly, as this simply means\nmaking a straw man of yourself before others do it for you. The purpose\nof this prelude is, however, to make less aware readers conscious of the\nbloody nature of this debate, as well as, perhaps, to inject a little\ndisclaimer at the outset, something akin to 'whatever I say will be\nattacked, so I'm simply going to go ahead and say this, whether it be\njudged right or wrong'. All of this notwithstanding, of course, it is also\nthe case that agitated scholars are much less dangerous than angry\npoliticians and trigger-happy frontline soldiers, although the first group\nalso has its damage to cause; but, in the final analysis, let academic\npolar bears wrestle in their frosty habitats, beating each other with\narticles and books, while demobilisation of armies proceeds and civilian\npopulations begin to enjoy the normality of existence that most\nscholars, Western-based at least, take for granted.\nThe purpose of this paper is to offer some observations on a\nrelationship (or perhaps several contemporaneous and intertwined\nrelationships) between two regions, two peoples, two political move-\nments-a relationship (or relationships) which has (or have) defined a\nhuge swathe of the Hom of Africa over the last generation, and indeed\nbeyond. The focal point of the paper is Eritrea, its relations with, and\nperceptions of, Tigray. It is not intended to be exhaustive: truly\nexhaustive work on this topic could not be contained within a single\narticle. It represents, rather, some thoughts based on a handful of key\ndocuments, field interviews and less 'formal' informants (deliberately\nnot high-ranking officials, as their views have been well-aired), and a\nrange of secondary literature much of which, indeed, has been so\nnecessarily contemporary that it can be classed as a kind of alternative\nbody of primary source material, certainly in terms of assessing outside\nperceptions of the relationship under study. The paper will hopefully\nserve to push the argument toward a synthesis of understanding; it is\ncertainly not intended to provoke ire, however unavoidable that\noutcome may be, considering that the author is mainly concerned to\nexamine the relationship with particular reference to the past, present\nand future status of Eritrea and Eritreans. The fact that it is therefore to\nsome extent 'Eri-centric' in its deliberations does not, one hopes,\nrender it 'anti-Ethiopian', as is often assumed. To quote the Eritrean\nPeople's Liberation Front is not to support them; to utilise the\nassertions of an emotional Eritrean informant is not to endorse his or\nher views; to criticise one 'side' is not to ally oneself with the other.\n(This has also been a problem in the context of the media coverage of\nthe conflict.) The purpose is to use such information as can be thus\naccumulated to measure the nature of the relationship, and perceptions\nof that relationship. The aim of this paper is to place certain tensions,\ndisagreements and misunderstandings in relation to the war which\nbroke out in 1998. The paper does not aim to explain the war per se,\nERITREAN RELATIONS WITH TIGRAY 371\nwhich would involve a rather different study: analysing economic\ndevelopments, for example, between 1991 and 1998; gathering data\nrelating to border matters during the same period and indeed much\nearlier; analysing in detail the diplomatic and political wranglings of the\ntwo governments after Eritrean independence. The aim here is to\ndiscuss certain aspects of the relationship in the context of eventual\ninter-state conflict. The 1998-2000 war, in other words, is actually our\nstarting point: and from that point the paper works backwards, aiming\nto explain how certain much longer-standing issues contributed to it.\nNor is the paper supposed to be a detailed study of the two movements\nthemselves. The Eritrean People's Liberation Front, or EPLF (Pool,\n2001), and the Tigray People's Liberation Front, or TPLF (Young,\n1997), were not monolithic movements: they had their internal crises,\nshifts in direction, leadership rivalries and schisms, their own wars to\nfight, as it were. The paper does not deal in any detail with the\nindividuals behind the acronyms, but is concerned only with what the\nmovements came to represent; we are interested in their particular\nstandpoints and strategies, and not how those standpoints and\nstrategies were arrived at in terms of the internal politics of individuals.\nThe histories of these movements has been thoroughly and admirably\ndealt with by other scholars; they concern us only insofar as their\ndisagreements in the field reflected the broader, historical tensions and\nproblems of the two regions and peoples, again in direct relation to\nEritrean perception and identity.\nWhile this piece does assume a certain degree of prior knowledge of\nthe recent history of the Horn among its readers, it is perhaps advisable\nto outline in very brief terms the fundamentals of that history, although\nthere is an Appendix at the end of this paper which is aimed as a guide\nfor non-specialist readers. The governments which led Ethiopia and\nEritrea to war in May 1998 were descended from liberation movements\nwhose destruction of the Ethiopian Marxist regime of Mengistu Haile\nMariam-known popularly as the Derg, the Amharic for 'committee'-\nhad resulted in their elevation to power in 1991. The EPLF had, from\nthe early 1970s, overcome its rivals in the field to become the sole\nmovement in the struggle for Eritrean independence from Ethiopia; the\nTPLF had fought first for independence, or at least autonomy, but later\nframed its war in the wider context of a democratic Ethiopia. Both were\nultimately successful. But their triumph institutionalised a set of\ndisagreements and contradictions which had plagued relations between\nthe movements since the liberation war, during which they had-\nnecessarily-both military and political contacts. These tensions\nreflected the problematic nature of the historical relationship between\nEritrea and Tigray more broadly, and incorporated such issues as land,\nidentity and, ultimately, destiny, as well as mutual misconceptions and\nmisunderstandings as to the other's mental outlook. This has been,\nperhaps, most visibly manifest in the common Tigrayan resentment of a\nperceived Eritrean superiority complex, the origins of which are unclear\nbut most likely stems from Eritrea's Italian colonial experience. Above\nall, the new reality of an independent Eritrean state from 1991, its very\n372 ERITREAN RELATIONS WITH TIGRAY\nFIGURE 1 The Region\nKey ethnic regions mentioned in the text: AFAR, AMHARA, TIGRAY, TIGRINYA\nSUDAN TIGRAY\nAMHARA\n.AddiS Ababa\nETHIOPIA\nKENYA\nNote: These maps do not reflect the decisions recently taken by the UN Border\nCommission, but rather describe the colonial borders to be found on\nmost maps of the region drawn during the period under study.

During the mid-\n1990s, there was much public discourse between the two govern-\nments-governments which, at their cores, were composed of and\ndirected by veterans of the wars of liberation in the 1970s and 1980s,\nalthough this was much more blatantly the case in Eritrea-on the need\nfor closer economic and political co-operation, and some tangible\nmoves were made in this direction, for example on matters of trade,\nnationality and residency, and defence. The most visible indication of\ndisharmony came with the introduction of a new Eritrean currency in\nlate 1997, which created a certain degree of rancour in commercial and\nfinancial relations; and then, in May 1998, with supposedly shocking\nsuddenness, the two countries found themselves at war over the matter\nof borders and undemarcated territory at various points along their\ncommon frontier. It quickly transpired that minor, localised border\nclashes had been taking place since at least 1993, gaining in intensity in\nthe middle of 1997. Early hopes that the conflict could be contained\nproved baseless, and the war escalated into perhaps the largest\nconventional conflict of its kind since Iran-Iraq in the 1980s. It\nended in June 2000, with a formal agreement following in December; at\nthe time of writing, however, relations have not been normalised.\nTHE GREAT UNEXPECTED WAR?\nMODERN MEMORY AND INTERPRETATION\nThe terms in which much of the world's media framed its thoughts on\nthe war between Eritrea and Ethiopia were markedly one-dimensional.\nThere is nothing unusual in this: rarely have contemporary Western\nobservers attempted to apply to African warfare the same sophisticated\nanalysis which they apply to their own (Reid, 2000). These were two\nbald men fighting over a comb; two poverty-stricken African nations\n(the 'hostile tribes' concept was lurking just below the surface) fighting\nfor pride at the expense of the material dignity of their populations; two\nignorant governments engaging in brutal and bloody 'First World War\ntactics' for pieces of insignificant land. When Mricans fight, the world\ntuts disapprovingly, which is one thing, and condescendingly, which is\nanother. But in looking at the nature of Eritrean-Tigrayan relations\nover time and space, one thing is clear in the first instance: the war\nitself, while it took most (including the author) by surprise when it first\ncame to public attention, was not a tragic but isolated interruption of\nthe normal course of events. A study of certain aspects of the recent past\nprovides something of the answer to what many in 1998 held to be an\nERITREAN RELATIONS WITH TIGRAY 375\nimpenetrable puzzle, for the war now appears as part of a much longer\nand more complex sequence of events and relationships. It was a\ncommonplace to state that no-one expected a conflict, among Eritreans\nand foreign correspondents alike; yet there is no conflict in human\nhistory which is completely unexpected to everyone involved in it, as we\nshall see.\nThere seems little need to discuss in any detail the incidents on the\nsouth-western Eritrean border in May 1998, nor the events around\nthem, as these have been dealt with elsewhere (Ruth Iyob, 2000: 663,\n672-6; Tekeste and Tronvoll, 2000: 1, 28-9), and are not in any case\ncentral to our story. Suffice it to say here that the exchange of fire\nbetween Eritrean and Ethiopian armed units around the tiny village of\nBadme, and incidents in the same and other areas some months\npreviously, swiftly led to the escalation of what appeared initially to be a\nborder clash into full-scale inter-state war. Since the outbreak of the\nconflict, there has been a growing and natural focus on the relationship\nbetween the protagonists, chiefly the liberation fronts themselves, both\nduring the liberation war and since Eritrean independence in 1991. A\nhandful of scholars have sought to 'make sense of it all'. Ruth Iyob, for\nexample, is surely right to caution against 'glib analyses [and] simplistic\nanswers' in her study of'diasporic' Eritrea's relations with 'hegemonic'\nEthiopia (Ruth Iyob, 2000: 660), while the title used by Tekeste\nNegash and Kjetil Tronvoll for their book on the conflict, Brothers at\nWar, leaves no doubt even before the reader opens the volume about\nhow the authors view the relationship between the two countries, and\nhow presumably 'unnatural' they consider the conflict to have been.\nThey belong to what might be labelled the 'family rift' camp, the two\nbald men fighting over the comb assumed to be closely related (Tekeste\nand Tronvoll, 2000: 12-21). The work of Matsuoka and Sorenson\n(2001) offers some intelligent and thoughtful insights into regional\nidentities and loyalties. Such work has also drawn on earlier, pre-war\n(and liberation war-era) scholarship dealing with relations during the\narmed struggle, including research undertaken by John Young (1996,\n1997, 1998), David Pool (1983, 1998, 2001), Patrick Gilkes (1983)\nand Alemseged Abbay (1998). It is worth noting at this juncture,\nhowever, that those writing on Eritrea have usually tended to have\nrather less to say on relations with the TPLF than vice versa: we will\nreturn to this point later.\nThis has also been, among Eritreans, a time of reflection concerning\ntheir relationship with Ethiopia in general and Tigray in particular.\nWhile a great many informed observers of the liberation war, and of\ncourse Eritreans themselves, were aware of the difficult relationship\nbetween the movements, or at the very least between the leadership of\nthe movements, during that period, there developed after 1991\nsomething of a public myth based on the notion that the friendship of\nbrothers in arms had successfully made the transition to government. It\nenabled, for example, President Clinton to talk of an 'African\nrenaissance', and it is certainly true that a cursory glance at the public\nrelationship between the two governments for much of the 1990s would\n376 ERITREAN RELATIONS WITH TIGRAY\nhave led the casual observer to conclude that these were indeed two\nvery close allies. The silence, perhaps, should have been deafening:\nprior to the war, there was scarcely any detailed public discourse in\nEritrea on the relationship between 1991 and 1998 (nor, indeed, on\nthat during the 1970s and 1980s), save for official statements\nproclaiming how well it was all going and on plans for closer relations\nin the future. Once the war erupted, however, and perhaps especially\nfollowing the deportation of large numbers of Eritreans from Ethiopia,\nthere was an outpouring of opinion concerning the nature of the\nEthiopian state in general (depicted in a perennial, almost ahistorical,\nmanner), and Tigray and Tigrayans in particular. This seemed to\nrepresent a deep well of emotion which Eritreans had sealed up in\nfavour of a quiet life. To be fair, the jubilation following the\nachievement of independence was more than enough, for ordinary\nEritreans at any rate, to engender a selective amnesia concerning certain\nless pleasant aspects in the history of the liberation war. If so, however,\nthen the events of 1998-2000 were a brutal awakening: their own\nhistory had returned to haunt them. The author once put this to a\nveteran of the liberation war, who had never before spoken to him of\nTigray or the TPLF-known pejoratively as the Woyane1-but who\npromptly launched into a historical lecture outlining how Tigrayans\ncould never be trusted, neither now nor during the liberation struggle.2\nYet closer examination of the views expressed by Eritreans about\nTigray, the TPLF (represented in this context as a monolithic 'thing')\nand Ethiopia in general reveals some interesting paradoxes in the\nperception and understanding of these relationships. This is especially,\nalthough by no means exclusively, true in the border areas, affected\nmost profoundly by the recent war and in particular by the Ethiopian\noffensive of May-June 2000.3 On the one hand, there is the idea that\n'good relations' had always existed across the border, that highland\ncommunities on either side of the Mereb River-which defines much of\nthe central section of the frontier-were indelibly intertwined, shared\ncultural links, were socially involved with one another (in terms of\n1 The term Woyane simply means 'uprising' or 'revolt', and was apparently first used during\nthe Tigrayan insurrection against Emperor Haile Sellassie in 1943. The term was not\nderogatory in the first instance, but the EPLF made it thus; in the other direction, the TPLF\nnicknamed the EPLF sha'abiya, Arabic for 'popular' or 'of the people', again not actually\ninsulting in terms of strict meaning but in certain contexts pejorative nonetheless.\n2 This conversation took place in June 2000, following Ethiopia's full-scale invasion of\nEritrea, and at a time when anti-Tigrayan feeling across Ethiopia was at fever pitch. The\nEritrean Government had begun a programme of repatriation, but in the wake of the\nEthiopian army's success many now asserted that it was too late, that the sizeable Tigrayan\ncommunity in Eritrea had already done the damage in terms of undermining the Eritrean war\neffort from within. There is no doubt that something of a scapegoat was needed. Nonetheless,\nthe author's informant explained that during the liberation war, the Derg authorities had\ninfiltrated EPLF cells and spied on the inhabitants of Asmara using Tigrayans, who of course\nspoke Tigrinya and who were thus difficult to distinguish from Eritrean highlanders.\n3 The author toured these areas extensively in July and August 2000, shortly after the\nceasefire.\nERITREAN RELATIONS WITH TIGRAY 377\nweddings, funerals and religious feast-days, for example), and were\ncommercially dependent on one another. According to this view, the\nevents of 1998 and after were particularly appalling because of the\nmanner in which those good relations had been so abruptly betrayed\nand forsaken. One informant explained to the author how, before the\nwar, 'our relations with Tigray ... were good', and how 'we had the\nsame culture'. Now, however, following the war, 'the relationship is\nforever damaged,.4 On the other hand, however, there is the view that\n'we knew all along that something like this would happen'. Tigrayans-\nor 'Agame',5 as Eritreans sometimes contemptuously refer to them-\ncannot be trusted and never could. One EPLF veteran told the author\nhow in 1991, upon the winning of Eritrean independence, 'our\ngrandparents' had warned against trying to improve the relationship\nwith Tigray, saying, 'Be careful, these people are dangerous, we know\nthem well!,6 In other words, things have ever been thus, and they will be\nalways.\nIn reality, of course, as was also the case during the liberation war,\nthese two views are not necessarily mutually exclusive; rather, they\nreflect the complexity of the relationship, and indeed it is a relationship\nwhich is more complex than many Eritreans, perhaps, would care to\nadmit. Certainly, the 'Tigray issue' for Eritreans, and the 'Eritrea issue'\nfor Tigrayans, is a distinct one within the broader arena of Eritrean-\nEthiopian relations, because there is a closeness---whether uncomfor-\ntable, or snug, or both-between Eritrea and Tigray which is clearly not\ndemonstrable for relations between Eritrea and other parts of Ethiopia.\nAt the same time, however, the apparently paradoxical perception of\nTigray in Eritrea is a reflection of the much broader perception of\nEthiopia as a whole, and symptomatic of the intrinsically problematic\nrelations between Eritrea and Ethiopia which have always existed but\nwhich have only comparatively recently attracted closer attention. It is\nclear, above all, that Eritreans have been simultaneously naIve and\ncynical, open and suspicious: 'Tigrayans were our brothers; you can\nnever trust a Tigrayan'; 'we can work openly with Ethiopia as equal and\nsovereign partners'; 'Ethiopia will always have a jealous and expansio-\nnist policy toward Eritrea'.\nSometimes, indeed, the two views appear side by side, a clear\ncontradiction emerging in the perception of what Tigray is or does, in\nterms of historical patterns and the characteristics of the relationship.\nAs one informant told the author:\n4 Interviewed by the author: Mekonen Gebrehiwot, Tsadika, Eritrea, 18 July 2000.\n5 The precise origins of the term 'Agame' as an insult are unclear. Agame is a district in the\neastern part of modern Tigray, with its capital at Adigrat. Eritreans tended to refer to all\nTigrayans who came across the border looking for work in Eritrea as 'Agame', and the negative\nconnotations of the term derive from the fact that these migrant labourers took on menial,\nlow-paid work, saving money to take or send back to Tigray. The word itself, it seems, often\nreflects a wider attitude which has had a significant psychological impact on Tigrayans, who\nregard the insult as clear evidence of the Eritrean superiority complex.\n6 Interviewed by the author: Simon Berhane, Adi Nefas, Eritrea, 20 July 2000.\n378 ERITREAN RELATIONS WITH TIGRAY\nEritrea and Tigray have had a long relationship. Over all these border areas,\nthere was trade, exchange, movement of people in both directions. People\noften moved deep inside each other's territory, carrying commodities. The\nWoyane are trying to eradicate this relationship ... History is being repeated\nby the Woyane. Tigrayan feudal rulers were coming to Eritrea from the\nthirteenth to the sixteenth centuries [sic], for example, and as a result all the\nvillages in this part of Eritrea are located on hilltops, for safety and\nprotection. Tigrayans were always coming to Eritrea to loot and destroy; the\nWoyane are simply repeating history. 7\nThus is the volatility and paradox of the proverbial 'frontier' under-\nlined, a situation by no means unique to Eritreans and Ethiopians; it\nmay be assumed that a distinction is nonetheless actually being drawn\nhere between the 'people' of Tigray and their rulers.\nStrong emotion, particularly among oral informants in the border\nareas, should of course be taken into account in analysing statements\nmade in the immediate aftermath of the fighting, and extreme\nassertions should generally be treated with caution. This caveat heeded,\nhowever, it is also true that the expressions of shock and anger are\nrevealing of popular attitudes toward neighbouring Tigray in particular,\nas well as Ethiopia in general. It should also be remembered that the\noral informants of this story are hardly unaccustomed to war and\nhardship, and thus they are, as it were, 'experts' in levels of both\nregional and local crisis. A great many informants emphasised that the\nrecent war, and in particular the Ethiopian offensive of May and June\n2000, far surpassed anything before witnessed in the region in living\nmemory, in terms of intensit~ of military activity, bloodshed and levels\nof vitriol. One elderly farmer in an area which was the focus of a major\nEthiopian attack claimed he had seen nothing like it in his lifetime, even\nthough he had lived through the civil war between the Eritrean\nliberation movements in the late 1970s,9 and the later attempts by the\nforces of the Derg to crush the Eritrean guerrillas in the area. A local\nadministrator made a similar claim, asserting that 'the soldiers of the\nDerg brought destruction only to military targets; but the Woyane have\ncommitted atrocities against poor farmers. This is completely different,\nand much worse'. 10 Another informant exclaimed that 'we have seen\nmany successive Ethiopian regimes; but the Woyane we cannot\nunderstand' .11 His colleague concurred, asserting that 'successive\nEthiopian regimes said, \"we do not want the Eritrean people, only\n7 Interviewed by the author: Simon Berhane, Adi Nefas, Eritrea, 20 July 2000. The\ninformant became excited by the author's questions on this theme, and prior to his short\nlecture exclaimed, 'You are the historian, why are you asking me? You should know this\nalready!'\n8 Interviewed by the author: Tesfamichael Kahsay, the Tsadakelay valley area, Eritrea, 18\nJuly 2000.\n9 See ELF and EPLF in the Appendix.\n10 Interviewed by the author: Mekonen Gebrehiwot, Tsadika, Eritrea, 18 July 2000.\n11 Interviewed by the author: Woldeab Mitsun, Adi Nefas, Eritrea, 19 July 2000.\nERITREAN RELATIONS WITH TIGRAY 379\nland and property.\" But the Woyane are trying to destroy Eritrean\nculture, identity, its very existence' .12\nUnderstandable though these kinds of statements may be, they are\nnot easy to accept at face value, and it must be assumed that they reflect\na quite distinct set of values and perceptions. The Derg carried out a\nwide range of atrocities against civilians, a fact which is now well\ndocumented and which was certainly appreciated at the time (Dines,\n1988; Harding, 1993); that regime can also be accused of having been\ncommitted to the 'destruction of Eritrean identity'. It is striking to see\nthe Derg somehow 'humanised' in this way, albeit by default, but the\nissue here may be one of 'accepted norms'. The destruction brought to\nEritrea by the Tigrayan-led army was considerable in many areas, but\nby no stretch of the imagination could it be considered worse-in\nmaterial terms-than that resulting from Derg military operations. In\nsome way, perhaps, destruction of this kind is 'acceptable' when it is\ninflicted by a distant, Amhara-dominated regime in Addis Ababa, but it\nbecomes wholly 'unacceptable' when it comes from the direction of\nneighbouring Tigray. It is the identification of Tigray at the heart of the\n1998-2000 war, therefore, which is paramount. It might also be\nsuggested that dissatisfaction in some quarters at the manner in which\nthe Eritrean government prosecuted the war-it was compelled to\nwithdraw its army from huge swathes of territory in western and\nsouthern Eritrea in May 2000-generated a deep sense of anger which\nwas nonetheless not directed at the Eritrean government, this being\nneither a moral nor a political option at that time, but at Ethiopia. This\nis, however, beyond the scope of this paper.\nThe writings of Eritreans, both inside Eritrea and abroad, after the\noutbreak of the war would fill several volumes, not all of them\nscientifically useful. It will suffice to take a few short examples to\nillustrate some of the key themes: the following post-1998 samples all\nappear in one particularly relevant issue of the Eritrean Studies Review,\nthe journal of the Eritrean Studies Association. 13 Here, for example,\nemphasis is placed on the notion of 'Greater Tigray' expansionism,\ndeveloped by the more militant wing of the TPLF, which according to\none writer 'threatens Eritrea's territorial integrity' (Kidane Mengisteab,\n1999: 92). As we shall see, this is one of those ideas which apparently\nsprang out of nowhere in the late 1990s but which in fact has a lengthy\ngenealogy. The notion of a 'grander plan' on the part of the TPLF-\ndominated Ethiopian government is described in an article which draws\nexplicit comparisons between current Tigrayan aggression and the\nincursions of Emperor Yohannes and his trusted commander Ras Alula\nin the 1870s and 1880s Gordan Gebre-Medhin, 1999). Again, this was\n12 Interviewed by the author: Keshi [priest] Tekabo Habte, Adi Nefas, Eritrea, 19 July 2000.\nThis informant's church had been badly damaged in the fierce fighting around the village of\nAdi Nefas, ironically by Eritrean artillery fire which was directed at the Ethiopians based in the\nvillage.\n13 'Special Issue' of the Eritrean Studies Review, 3 (2) (1999).\n380 ERITREAN RELATIONS WITH TIGRAY\nnot the first time that perceptions of the deeper past had been fashioned\ninto weaponry by modern protagonists. Indeed, in his introduction to\nthe volume, the editor pulls no punches:\n... just as Yohannes met with resistance from Eritrea, so will the TPLF, a\ngroup that seems to have learned nothing from Emperor Yohannes'\ndisastrous Eritrean experience. The TPLF's inability to learn from history\nwill lead to the ultimate destruction of Mekele's political and military power.\n[Tekie Fessehatzion, 1999: v]\nIn another essay, the writer-a senior veteran of the liberation war and\ncurrently a researcher in the PFDJ-recalls a tour by some TPLF\nleaders to the EPLF base area, and relates how their lectures were\nconcerned solely with 'the indignities and insults suffered by the people\nof Tigray'. Different peoples, including Eritreans, had for years looked\ndown on Tigrayans, and this, announced one speaker, would now be\nrectified. There was, apparently, no discussion of ideology or matters of\npolitical or military urgency facing both liberation movements, but only\nan indignant rant about how Tigrayans would soon be treated with the\nrespect they deserved. The writer recalls being disturbed by the speech.\nThe struggle of the EPLF, he asserts,\nwas a war of independence pure and simple-we warned the enemy out of\nour country. [That of the TPLF], we felt, had a frightening psychological\naspect. Satisfaction for them could only come, we agreed, if they rose above\nthe common run, from which elevated status they could 'do unto others as\nhad been done unto them'. Danger there, somewhere! [Alemseged Tesfai,\n1999: 216]\nHe assures us, moreover, that '[t]his is not a hindsight reconstruction,\nbut what we all felt at the time. When in the eighties the TPLF\nlaunched its four or five year hate-EPLF campaign, therefore, it did not\ncome as a.complete surprise' (ibid.). The rift between the movements in\nthe mid-1980s, as we shall see, is one thing; whether or not the 1998\nwar came as a 'complete surprise' to this particular author is not made\nclear. He would surely have understood from his own experience,\nhowever, that liberation wars-to paraphrase Oscar Wilde-are rarely\npure and never simple, although it is classic EPLF-speak to portray\ntheirs in precisely that manner.\nFinally, a non-Eritrean, the journalist and noted 'Eri-phile' Dan\nConnell has a contribution to make. Writing of Badme, the village\nwhere the shooting began in May 1998, he recalls that\n[t]his remote peasant hamlet was under Eritrean administration in 1985\nwhen I visited it with EPLF guerrillas, just after it had been obliterated by\nEthiopian jet fighters, and it appeared within Eritrea on all the maps of the\nday. However, a week later I crossed the border into Tigray with the TPLF\nto witness the exodus of thousands of starving Tigrayans on their way to\nSudan. When I mentioned where I'd just been, a TPLF fighter commented,\n'You were not in Eritrea-Badme is Tigray.' At the time, I thought little of it,\nbut in retrospect, this was a signal that details count. [Connell, 1999: 197]\nERITREAN RELATIONS WITH TIGRAY 381\nDetails certainly did count, as liberation movement leaders, if not Dan\nConnell, were very well aware at the time. At any rate, 'hindsight' and\n'retrospect' were in general awarded great significance at the end of the\n1990s, but, as we shall see, not everyone would have needed such\nanalytical tools to understand what had actually happened in 1998,\nwhile at least some claims of complete surprise must be regarded as\nsomewhat disingenuous.\nA BYZANTINE REVOLUTION (1): THE QUESTION OF IDENTITY\nIt was unavoidable that the Eritrean and Tigrayan liberation struggles\nwould become intertwined, in terms of geographical proximity if not\nfraternal union; they shared the most basic common objective in the\ndestruction of the Derg regime. But were conflict and co-operation\ninevitable in equal measure? John Young (1996) has referred to the\n'pragmatic' nature of their co-operation. But that sphere of mutual\nbenefit was always limited in scope and nature by disagreements and\nmisunderstandings between the movements which went to the very\nheart of the relationship under study, and which were unresolved at the\nend of the liberation war, and remained so throughout the 1990s. They\nwere derived from the uncompromising nature of the Eritrean\nliberation struggle, at least as defined and led by the EPLF, and the\ndifficulties which certain elements within the leadership of the TPLF\nhad in dealing and coming to terms with this. These problems, more\nclearly discernible now than perhaps they were before 1998, would\nnonetheless have been well known to the leadership circles as well as to\ninformed observers of the two movements over the past twenty years. A\ncloser examination of the problems themselves demonstrates the degree\nto which the war in 1998 should have been anticipated. The story of the\nrelations between the various Eritrean and Ethiopian movements is a\ncomplex and convoluted one, and challenges the concentration of the\nmost acronym-conscious student (Ruth Iyob, 1995; Pool, 2001: 147-\n50). At base, however, it underlines the ,degree to which these\nmovements were indelibly and often bitterly intertwined, their changing\nfortunes alternatively blamed on or associated with one another. It is, in\nmore than one sense, a sorry tale of chronic disunity and frequently\npetty, arcane and largely meaningless disputes-at least for 'the people',\nwhich movements on either side of the Mereb purported to represent-\nin the face of a more powerful enemy. It helps to explain the\ndetermination of the EPLF to emerge as the sole movement in the\nstruggle for Eritrean independence, as well as its resolve in government\nto engender a sense of absolute national unity at whatever cost. To a\nlesser extent, perhaps, it also explains the TPLF's later determination\nto consolidate power in Ethiopia as a whole. Certainly, the experiences\nof the struggle have made both movements painfully aware of the\nconsequences of disunity and political fragmentation.\nThe origins of the TPLF itself as an organisation would become\nsomething of a sore point over time. It is widely accepted that the\nmodern Tigrayan nationalist movement was created with Eritrean\n382 ERITREAN RELATIONS WITH TIGRAY\nassistance (Clapham, 1988: 60, 209; Keller, 1988: 208, 210; Young,\n1998: 37), although as Young has presciently argued, this should\nneither be over-simplified nor exaggerated (Young, 1996: 105).\nCertainly, Tigrayans resented the implication that their struggle was\ncreated and maintained by the EPLF, and that their movement was a\nmere adjunct of the latter. This was not simply in response to the\nperceived aloofness of the EPLF leadership, returned to below, but also\nto the fact that even the Ethiopian state-run media, in its tirades against\nthe bandits of the north, would often omit to mention the Tigrayan\nstruggle altogether, instead lumping it in with that of the Eritreans.\nMuch early wrangling between the movements, then, must be\ninterpreted as stemming from Tigrayan self-assertion, as jostling for\nposition took place vis-a-vis a myriad of other 'revolutionary' groups,\nincluding the ELF, the TLF, and the EPRP (see Appendix).\nAnalysis of key documents dating from the mid-1980s reveals the\nnature of some of the tensions, contradictions and misunderstandings\nwithin the relationship. These documents-from both the EPLF and\nTPLF-are not, of course, to be treated as unproblematic sources of\ninformation: they were very much the products of their age, and were\nproduced after relations between the two movements had already been\nbroken off. To some extent, they were written to justify what had\nhappened. At the same time, however, they must be regarded as key\ncontemporary statements on the nature and form of the relationship at\nits worst, and to that end are revealing of the issues, attitudes and\nideological and\/or political standpoints which this paper is interested in\nexploring. They highlight a number of problems which would come\nback to haunt the movements in government, and demonstrate the\nlengthy genealogy of certain issues which can be understood as having\ncontributed to uneasy relations at the time-the height of the struggle-\nand more specifically to the outbreak of war between two sovereign\nstates over a decade later. Some of the arguments between the\nmovements were largely of contemporary relevance only, and not of\nlong-term significance, and therefore do not concern us here. There\nwas disagreement, for example, over the military strategy of the\nEPLF,14 following the strategic retreat of the Eritreans to the north of\nthe country in the face of new Soviet-backed Ethiopian offensives. This\nwas in fact as much about the perceived 'democratic' and 'popular'\nnature of the movements themselves as about actual strategy, and the\nmatter was never fully resolved, even though military co-operation\nwould resume toward the end of the 1980s (Young, 1996: 108-9).15\n14 Publications of the EPLF: 'The TPLF and the development of its relations with the\nEPLF' (c.1984): Research and Documentation Centre, Asmara (hereafter RDC), Acc.

But\nthere were issues which were clearly of major significance for future\nrelations between a sovereign Eritrea and a Tigrayan-dominated\nEthiopia, and these included the interrelated questions of 'nationality',\nor national and ethnic identity, and the boundaries of Eritrea.\nAt the core of the disagreement over the 'nationality' question lay the\nissue of the ultimate objectives of the Eritrean and Tigrayan movements\nrespectively. While the Eritrean movement described its struggle as\n'anti-colonial' and unambiguously sought complete independence for\nEritrea, the TPLF at times appeared somewhat confused as it\ndeveloped its own programme. Was it to be an exclusively 'Tigrayan\nnationalist' movement, or should it regard itself as the vanguard of a\ndemocratic Ethiopian alliance? The resolution of this basic question\nwould involve conflict with the Eritreans, and reflected, whether\nsubliminally or consciously, the strains and contradictions in the\nEritrean-Tigrayan relationship (Gilkes, 1983: 205-6). Initially, the\nTPLF appeared to present itself as a secessionist movement, with the\nestablishment of an independent republic of Tigray as its cardinal aim\n(Young, 1997: 99). The movement seemed to be articulating the idea\nthat a 'multi-ethnic' organisation was unrealistic and that separate\npeoples should fight their own wars of liberation. In its manifesto of\n1975, for example, the TPLF defined a Tigrayan as anyone who spoke\nTigrinya, the language of central highland Eritrea as well as of Tigray\nitself; it also included 'frontier' groups such as the Irob and the Afar,\nfound in both Eritrea and Tigray. This attempt to define a 'pure'\nTigrayan, whether consciously or not impinging on highland Eritrea,\nwas nevertheless later interpreted by the EPLF as a dangerous new\nform of Tigrayan nationalism. 16 On its part the TPLF asserted that\nfrom the outset it had supported the Eritrean cause, which it believed to\nbe a just anti-colonial struggle. 17 It is noteworthy, indeed, that the\nTPLF later claimed as its 'great achievement' its success in influencing\nthe Ethiopian people, particularly Tigrayans, as to the justness of the\nEritrean cause. The Tigrayan peo~le needed to 'change their negative\nmindset on the Eritrean question'. 8 It is significant that the 'Tigrayan\npeople' needed the most persuading, while the extent to which the\nTPLF actually persuaded itself of the justness of the Eritrean cause is a\nmatter of some debate.\nThe EPLF expressed concern about what it regarded as an aggressive\nnew form of Tigrayan nationalism, the ultimate goal of which was the\nestablishment of a Tigrayan nation-state, and in which the perils of the\npolitical usage of history-something at which the leaders of the EPLF\nwere also becoming adept-were becoming clear. For example, the\n16 RDC Ace. No. 05062\/Rela\/3, p. 4.\n17 RDC Ace. No. Rela\/10359, pp. 42-3.\n18 ibid., pp. 44-5, 47.\n384 ERITREAN RELATIONS WITH TIGRAY\nTPLF asserted that Tigray's emergence as a modern 'nation' could be\ndated to the reign of Emperor Yohannes (1872-89), the first Tigrayan\nruler of the highland Christian kingdom for several centuries (Young,\n1997: 99).19 This would have given Eritreans cause for concern: the\nfocus on Yohannes meant, for them, the military incursions of his right-\nhand man Ras Alula onto the Eritrean plateau, while Yohannes himself\nwas probably the first ruler in the modem era to clearly articulate claims\nover large parts of what later became Eritrea, which it was asserted had\nlong formed part of the 'historic' Abyssinian kingdom (Portal, 1892).\nThese claims had been further developed by successive Ethiopian\nregimes through the twentieth century. It may be wondered whether the\nTPLF was innocently unaware of the implications of their historical\nattachment to Yohannes, and the manner in which it could cause\noffence to Eritreans, even to a movement such as the EPLF which,\nwhile absorbed in the machinations of the 1940s, has to date shown\nvery little interest, political or otherwise, in the pre-colonial era. But\nwhether conscious or not, the Yohannes fixation reflected one of the\nTPLF's core difficulties, that of identity, and of defining Tigray,\nparticularly without Eritrea. It was an exercise in self-definition which\ncould not be divorced from the clarification of relations with Eritrea or,\nfor that matter, with Ethiopia as a whole (Clapham, 1988: 211).\nDisagreement over the question of nationality is to some degree\nsymbolised by the issue of ethnic groups within Eritrea and Tigray, in\nparticular the Afar. The TPLF, as stated in its initial manifesto,\nbelieved the Afar of Tigray to be an integral part of the proposed\nnation-state, and as such the Tigrayans declared themselves strongly\nopposed to the Afar liberation movement then in operation, stating that\nthe latter could not be allowed to compete with the TPLF itself. The\nTPLF did, however, support the right of the Eritrean Mar to secede,\nand further, supported the concept of an 'Afar triangle' incorporating\nthose of Eritrea, north-east Ethiopia and Djibouti. 20 On the one hand\nthis can be seen as part of an attempt by the TPLF to portray its\nstruggle as a 'national' one, in which all peoples within Tigray were\n'Tigrayans', but that of Eritrea as 'multi-national', as Eritrea-an\nartificial colonial creation-was composed of many 'nations'. In a\nstrange sense this seems to have been a deliberate rebuttal of the\nEritreans' own original argument, that Tigray must fight for Ethiopia,\nnot simply itself. It certainly represented a significant modification of\nthe TPLF's earlier professed support for Eritrea's cause; for the EPLF\nit smacked of hypocrisy, as the Tigrayan movement, which refused to\ncountenance rival secessionist movements in its own province, was\nsimultaneously tellin~ the EPLF that it must co-operate with other\nEritrean movements. 1 The Tigrayans were attempting to articulate a\n19 RDC Ace. No. 05062\/Rela\/3, pp. 19-20.\n20 ibid., p. 20. The TPLF did eventually, toward the end of the 1980s, cooperate with the\nAfar Liberation Front.\n21 ibid., p. 27.\nERITREAN RELATIONS WITH TIGRAY 385\nclear sense of united nationhood-and of course here both movements\nhad much in common, and that in itself would necessarily cause\nfriction-while deliberately undermining that of Eritrea and denying\nthe Eritrean struggle the same nationalist substance as their own. At the\nsame time, there may well have been a link between the TPLF's\nsupport for the 'Afar triangle' and its claim, as we shall see, for access to\nthe sea through the Danakil. Certainly, much of this pushing and\nshoving between the two movements seems to clarify some of the\napparently arcane arguments which emerged more publicly after 1998.\nThe Eritrean position, of which the TPLF was highly suspicious, on\nsecession and the related question of nationalities was that while the\nright of secession might apply to groups oppressed by undemocratic\ngovernment, the principle of 'democratic unity' should take precedence\nover secession. For the TPLF, this was a violation of the fundamental\nright of people to self-determination, whether under democratic or\nundemocratic systems of rule. 22 The EPLF was clearly determined-as\nit remains today-to put to rest any spectre of internal Eritrean\ndisunity, while encouraging the Tigrayans to plan for a united and\ndemocratic Ethiopia. The bottom line, of course, is that the EPLF was\nnot really particularly interested in the issue of secession, as the entire\nEritrean struggle was formed around an anti-colonial ethos; secession as\na hypothetical notion did not concern the EPLF in the way that it\nclearly did the TPLF in the wider Ethiopian context, even if the TPLF\nwould argue that secession should have concerned the Eritreans, i.e. in\nterms of the right of Eritrean 'nationalities' to secede (Young, 1996:\n112-3). In any case, the EPLF was drawing a clear distinction between\nits struggle and that of Tigray. The disagreements between Eritrea and\nTigray on this issue did not bode well for future relations, because it\nwas clear that any future Tigrayan-dominated Ethiopian government\nwould be doubtful as to the actual legitimacy of Eritrea's entire struggle,\nas directed and controlled by the EPLF. The irony of some of the\nEritreans' statements cannot have been lost on the EPLF's own leaders.\nThey firmly rejected the concept of an independent Tigrayan nation,\nstating that Tigray lacked the 'economic, social and historical back-\nground' necessary to claim sovereign status,23 which is exactly what had\nbeen said of Eritrea itself forty years earlier. By a strange twist of\nargument-and these arguments certainly had their twists-the EPLF\nwas inadvertently investing in the 'historic Ethiopia' idea, the bane of\nthe Eritrean nationalist, by dismissing thus the basis of independent\nTigrayan nationhood, as though Tigray had always been part of a\nlarger, permanent state. The periods in which 'Tigray' had been\nautonomous from, if not wholly independent of, any central 'Abyssi-\nnian' government-for example for much of the eighteenth and\nnineteenth centuries-were overlooked. The TPLF, curiously, also\n22 RDC Ace. No. Rela\/10359, pp. 161-2.\n23 RDC Ace. No. 05062\/Re1a\/3, p. 20.\n386 ERITREAN RELATIONS WITH TIGRAY\noverlooked this, preferring instead to focus on the historic concept of\nthe united imperial 'Ethiopia' as represented, again, by the Tigrayan\nEmperor Yohannes. The TPLF's own historical viewpoint should\nactually have settled any modern dilemmas over secession or unity\nwithin Ethiopia: they had already answered their own question. Both\nsides, of course, could have come together to claim the inheritance of\nthe ancient Axumite Empire, whose heartland straddled both modern\nEritrea and Tigray, but this is, indeed, a different matter altogether.\nThe EPLF further regarded the Afar issue as 'very sensitive' and\ndeserving of 'deep research and study'. While the Eritreans implied\nthat, unlike the TPLF, they had no objection in principle to the\nactivities of the separate Afar movement, they emphasised that the 'Afar\nquestion' would be solved with the establishment of an independent\nEritrea, as would the 'question' of all the other ethnic groups inside\nEritrea; at the same time, however, the Afar in Tigray and in north-east\nEthiopia should be permitted to form their own democratic move-\nments.24 Each side was in effect telling the other the same thing, and\nwhich neither was prepared to do. For the EPLF, this was a deliberate\nriposte to the Tigrayan nationalist argument, and was a firm refusal to\nconsider any discussion of Eritrean 'nationalities' in the same vein as\nEthiopian 'nationalities'. Eritreans would achieve democratic unity in\nthe end, under the sole guidance of the EPLF; Ethiopians were\ncomprised of many nationalities, including Tigrayans, and they should\nalso work together for democratic unity. In much of this discourse, it is\npossible to detect a vaguely patronising and aloof tone to EPLF\npronouncements and statements of policy, the kind of attitude which\nthe TPLF had come to resent. In reality, of course, and more\nimportantly, this was not really a discourse at all. Each side was\nspeaking at the other: Eritreans are Eritreans, said one; Tigrayans are\nTigrayans, said the other. Each of them meant something completely\ndifferent.\nA BYZANTINE REVOLUTION (2): THE QUESTION OF BORDERS\nThe question of boundaries-the precise location of the frontier\nbetween the original Italian colony of Eritrea and the rest of\nEthiopia-was clearly closely related to that of nationality, and would\nlater return to haunt both governments in the most tragic of ways.\nConflict in this sphere actually first occurred between the TPLF and\nthe ELF, the EPLF's rival in the field, who began to contest boundaries\nbetween neighbouring administrative zones in south-west Eritrea and\nwestern Tigray (i.e. those areas considered 'liberated' by the contiguous\nguerrilla forces) and the position of the frontier in the area of Badme\nand Adiabo in the mid-1970s. This was at a time when Eritrea was\ndivided up between ELF (broadly west and south-west) and EPLF\n24 ibid.\nERITREAN RELATIONS WITH TIGRAY 387\n(central highlands, south-east). The ELF claimed the region up to\nSheraro as part of Eritrea, and as such asserted that the people\ninhabiting the region should be administered by the ELF; this was\nrejected by the Tigrayans, and armed clashes be~an to occur within the\ncontested area from 1976 (Young, 1996: 106).5 The TPLF claimed\nthat the ELF was responsible in the first instance for raising the issues of\n'boundaries and territorial claims'. Further, the ELF, 'without any\nhistorical or political grounds claimed that all the lowland Adiabo\nregion was part of Eritrean territory . . . The TPLF . . . assessed [the\nproblem] with tolerance and permitted the ELF to control the areas\nwhich had been previously administered by the ELF'; in other words,\nthe Eritreans could continue to administer what they had already\nseized, until the TPLF regained control of these areas.26 This they\nwould eventually do in alliance with the EPLF in the latter's internal\nstruggle with the ELF. In the meantime, however, the ELF was\npermitted to establish militia in those areas 'which were highly\npopulated by Eritrean people' .27 This last statement reflects a\nsignificant problem, then as more recently: even as the TPLF were\nclaiming that one of the Eritrean movements had violated Tigrayan\nterritorial integrity, they were acknowledging that the issue of actual\n'nationality' in the border areas was rather more ambiguous, that there\nwere 'Eritrean people' in the area being violated.\nThe destruction of the ELF as a fighting force in the Eritrean western\nlowlands by 1981 handed a great deal of this disputed region back to\nTPLF administration. This was, however, only the beginning of the\nproblem. If the issue had originally been brought to the fore by ELF\nincursions, through the early 1980s it was taken up with even greater\nvigour by the Tigrayans. Whether this reflected Tigrayan alarm at initial\nEritrean claims on their territory, whether they were made to feel\nvulnerable by the more powerful movements to the north in terms of\nterritorial 'expansionism', is uncertain. Certainly, however, by the time\na meeting between the movements was held in Khartoum in June and\nJuly 1983, borders were high on the agenda. The detail of the EPLF's\nlater statement on the matter is, perhaps, an indictment of both sides'\ninability to settle the matter before 1998 even though they had had\nalmost twenty years to do so:\nIn the period between 1979 and 1983, at different times the TPLF had\ncaused many serious problenls and tensions on the question of boundaries.\nThe EPLF stated then that it was not the right time to raise such questions\nand that the colonial boundary was clear. However, the TPLF [continued to\nraise] the boundary issue by claiming the territory of the district of Badme, in\nthe centre Tsorona, and in the south Bada, while the TPLF inhibited the\n25 ibid., p. 8.\n26 RDC Ace. No. Re1a\/l0359, p. 51.\n27 ibid.\n388 ERITREAN RELATIONS WITH TIGRAY\nEPLF's movement in and administration of those areas. Moreover, the\nTPLF [claimed that] Tigray had an outlet to the outside world through\nDankalia.28\nAll of this led the EPLF to assert, with a couple of years' hindsight, that\n'from its early stages the TPLF had an expansionist policy on the\nquestion of boundaries'. 29 There certainly seems little doubt that the\nTPLF did regard the demarcation-and in some place the redrawing-\nof its provincial boundaries as a crucial preparatory step toward the\nestablishment of a Tigrayan nation-state, should such an eventuality\nbecome desirable or feasible. The TPLF asserted that Tigray must be\nfully demarcated as a unified polity: its borders were not yet clear and\nshould be made so, particularly as the province had lost territory under\nboth Menelik and Haile Sellassie.30 This was a reference not only to\nEritrea, but also to Tigray's other neighbouring provinces in Ethiopia.\nThat the TPLF was unhappy with its current territory was something\nof which the EPLF would, by the end of the 1970s, have been very well\naware. But the Eritreans, for reasons which are not entirely clear, but\nwhich were doubtless interpreted by the Tigrayans as representing\ncharacteristic Eritrean arrogance and aloofness, refused to discuss the\nmatter. The EPLF stated unequivocally that 'Eritrea's legal boundary is\nits colonial boundary', and there could be no negotiation regarding 'any\nother fabricated boundary'.31 Even the TPLF, however, claimed to be\nwilling to shelve the matter until a later date: it asserted that it was not\nsufficient cause for conflict. It was, rather, a 'secondary question', and\ntheir sole reason for requesting demarcation was to clarify areas in\nwhich TPLF military units could operate and move freely against the\nenemy, a statement which the Eritreans may have regarded as\nsomewhat disingenuous. In any case, the TPLF argued, the boundary\nissue would be resolved in the future, either by a democratic\ngovernment of Ethiopia or by an independent Tigrayan state.32 The\nmajor difference with the EPLF, of course, is that while the Tigrayans\nmight concede the 'secondary' importance of the matter, the EPLF\nregarded it as a non-issue. Perhaps confronted with EPLF intransi-\ngence, and doubtless reflecting the fact that relations had by now\nbroken down, the TPLF nevertheless warned that:\nthis does not mean that there is no need for negotiation concerning the\nEritrean-Ethiopian boundary ... The TPLF's viewpoint is that Eritrea as a\nnation was created during Italian colonial rule. Therefore, by official\nagreement between the Ethiopian king Menelik II and the Italian\ngovernment, the boundary between Eritrea and Ethiopia was clearly\n28 RDC Ace. No. 05062\/Rela\/3, pp. 4, 13. All the areas mentioned in this paragraph were\nfought over between May 1998 and June 2000.\n29 ibid.\n30 ibid., pp. 19-20.\n31 ibid., p. 18.\n32 RDC Ace. No. ReIa\/l0359, p. 81.\nERITREAN RELATIONS WITH TIGRAY 389\ndemarcated ... However, we cannot say that there will be no problems in\nimplementing this Agreement between Menelik II and the Italian govern-\nment, because (1) for instance, some places are clearly demarcated on the\nmap but not clearly demarcated on the ground, and (2) moreover, in the\nagreement . . . some places are recognised as belonging to either Eritrea or\nEthiopia, but again the area may not be found in the respective country as it\nis stated in the agreement.33\nIt was the belief of the TPLF, nonetheless, 'that such problems can be\nsolved in the spirit of negotiation'. Ultimately, the Tigrayans declared\nwith some prescience, neither the TPLF nor the EPLF would be\nresponsible for resolving the boundary issue, but rather 'an inter-\nnationally recognised body ... will decide based on historical\ndocuments' .34\nTo a very real degree, the problematic relationship between Eritrea\nand Tigray, as represented by the EPLF and the TPLF, reflected the\ndifficulties both sides had in defining themselves, although in the\ncontext of liberation war the Eritreans had, perhaps, a rather more\nstraightforward task than the Tigrayans. For much of its early history,\nthe TPLF had toyed with the idea of an independent Tigrayan republic,\ndrawing-as the EPLF also did-on a selective interpretation of the\npast. But what exactly did the movement have in mind? Again, what\nwas Tigray to be without Eritrea? Although the notion of Tigrayan\nindependence was rejected by the EPLF, it seems possible to speculate\nthat the TPLF had in fact originally envisaged, at least implicitly, some\ndegree of unity with Eritrea. Talk of Tigrinya-speaking unity, noted\nearlier, was certainly strongly suggestive of this, and echoed similar\nideas current in the 1940s (Alemseged Abbay, 1998). Only some form\nof Tigray-Tigrinya unity would have justified the desire for an\nindependent Tigray (Gilkes, 1983: 205-6). TPLF rhetoric supporting\nthe Eritrean cause, while simultaneously claiming to have 'persuaded'\nthe Ethiopian people of the righteousness of that cause, may also, in\norigin, have been part of the same thought-process. It seems possible to\nsuggest that initially the TPLF had looked northward for its political\ndestiny; the stance of the EPLF forced the Tigrayans to avert their gaze.\nThe EPLF was clearly not interested, and effectively told the TPLF to\nlook southward instead, to fight for Ethiopia, although it is also possible\nthat the TPLF would have claimed the Ethiopian inheritance in any\ncase, in the course of time. It is certainly the case that, as events proved,\nthe Tigrayans proved themselves unable to resist that inheritance once\nit was within their grasp (Ruth Iyob, 2000: 677; Young, 1998: 50).\nOnce rebuffed by the Eritreans, the TPLF, already made conscious of\nthe territorial vulnerability of Tigray through the activities of the ELF,\n33 ibid., pp. 81-2.\n34 ibid.\n390 ERITREAN RELATIONS WITH TIGRAY\nbegan to insist on 'demarcation' of boundaries, an issue which was, and\nis, secondary to that of nationality and identity, issues which have more\nprofoundly shaped the political destiny of the region. The nature of\nEritrea's struggle, as represented by the EPLF, fundamentally altered\nthat destiny: it was a rejection of everything that had come before, the\ncarving of a new path in terms of regional identities. As Pool has\nargued, the EPLF's shaping of Eritrean nationalism 'disconnected ...\nChristian highlanders from the Christian Ethiopian empire, and\nMuslims from the neighbouring Arab Islamic world and its culture'\n(Pool, 1998: 21). For Tigray, perhaps, it could all have been very\ndifferent.\nFROM RIFT TO LIBERATION, TO MORE MODERN MEMORY AND\nINTERPRETATION\nIn the middle of 1985, relations were severed more or less completely.\nThe EPLF's decision to remain silent on matters which the Tigrayans\nwanted to debate 'publicly' was taken as something of an insult, further\nevidence of an Eritrean superiority complex and of the perceived\ntendency of the EPLF to refuse to accept their Tigrayan counterparts as\nequals (Young, 1996: 116).35 The formal rift endured over the next\nthree years as the two liberation movements pursued their separate wars\nagainst a faltering Derg regime (Clapham, 1988: 212). By the time\ncontact was re-established and co-operation was resumed in 1988, the\nwriting was already beginning to appear on the wall for Mengistu's\nincreasingly beleaguered state; but so it was too for future relations\nbetween the liberation movements whose military victories by that time\nhad awarded them prospects for government. Even when detente came,\ncore differences were glossed over and publicly ignored (Young, 1996:\n117). In March 1988 the EPLF achieved remarkable success at the\nbattle of Afabet in northern Eritrea, from which point the Ethiopian\narmy was on the defensive. In February 1989, with the help of Eritrean\nforces, the TPLF captured Shire in Tigray, virtually wiping the\nEthiopian army from the province. Within two years, the newly formed\nEPRDF alliance, dominated by the TPLF and to which several EPLF\nunits were seconded, was advancing on Addis Ababa. All appeared to\nbe going to the Eritreans' plan, while the Tigrayans themselves seemed\nto have realised their role within the broader Ethiopian arena.36 Yet the\n35 Foreign Relations Bureau of the TPLF: 'On Our Differences With The EPLF' (1986):\nRDC Ace. No. 2399, p. 3.\n36 Even so, the EPLF was disgusted by the fact that a number of TPLF fighters abandoned\nthe fight once Tigray was liberated, believing that their objective had been achieved. For the\nEPLF, this was evidence of the Tigrayans' ignorance of strategic necessities; for the TPLF\nthemselves, it demonstrated the movement's democratic character.\nERITREAN RElATIONS WITH TIGRAY 391\nfundamental contradiction which lay at the heart of the Eritrean-\nTigrayan alliance had not been resolved.\nMany, both foreign observers and Eritreans themselves, appeared to\nwant to forget the deep divisions of the past, or else were indeed wholly\nignorant of them. Roy Pateman, who was well acquainted with the\nEritrean struggle, asserted on the eve of the Eritrean-Ethiopian war that\n'[t]here are no military threats from Ethiopia while the Tigrayan\ndominated EPRDF government remains in power in Addis Ababa'\n(Pateman, 1998: 264). It is perhaps worthy of note that a virtually\nsolitary warning signal came not from anyone studying the Eritrean side\nbut from, again, John Young, who in the mid-1990s cautioned that\n'[p]olitical differences between the TPLF and the EPLF during their\nyears of struggle will be reflected in their ... future relations, and as a\nresult they may be far more problematic than is generally imagined'\n(Young, 1996: 120). There is a lesson here from which all of us can\nlearn, in terms of the value of remaining circumspect; but it is also clear\nthat even someone such as Pateman, who had been studying the\nEritrean struggle for several years, had overlooked the significance of\nthe differences between the Eritreans and the Tigrayans, differences\nwhich he himself had earlier acknowledged (Pateman, 1998: 126). But\nhe was certainly not alone among Eritrea-watchers or indeed Eritreans\nthemselves in terms of choosing to see a bright future. While those\nwriting on the Tigrayan dimension, or on the struggles of the region as a\nwhole, generally placed due emphasis on the Eritrean-Tigrayan\nrelationship, those concerned more or less exclusively with Eritrea\ntended to overlook it, perhaps, indeed, taking their cue from the public\npriorities set out by the EPLF itself.\nFairly representative of this vein was the essay by Amare Tekle\npublished in 1994, in which the writer pointed toward the 'special\nrelationship' between Eritrea and Ethiopia. Amare asserted that despite\n'significant differences', the two countries 'share certain similarities in\ntheir historical antecedents, evince common socio-cultural perceptions\nand encounter the same socio-economic problems' (Amare Tekle,\n1994: 2). Unity in the past was 'forced and unequal', but now there\nshould be forgiving and forgetting, and indeed good relations between\nthe two countries could ultimately lead to a more equitable and\nmutually beneficial union. Eritreans and Ethiopians should seek to\ncreate\ncommon institutions and processes which will mutually promote loose\nalliances guaranteeing peaceful co-existence and mutual security but which\nwill progressively be transformed into a confederation ensuring common\npolicies on security and international political affairs. This, it is hoped, will\nbe followed by a federation which secures political unity . . . The two sides\nwill progressively surrender part of their sovereignty to the common political\norganisation thus created at every stage. [Ope cit.: 17]\nThis general concept, hopelessly idealistic though it may seem with\nhindsight, was encapsulated within the agreements being signed\n392 ERITREAN RELATIONS WITH TIGRAY\nbetween the Eritrean and Ethiopian governments as earr as 1993, and\nthe public pronouncements which accompanied them.3 As Ruth Iyob\n(2000: 671) has suggested, this was a period characterised by 'a fluidity\nin political thinking'. To some, it must have seemed like the most\nspectacular of political gymnastics.\nMemory lost, if that is indeed what it was, swiftly became memory\nregained. This brings us back to the perceptions recorded at the\nbeginning of the article. The views of the distinguished Amare Tekle\nneed to be contrasted with the recollections of Eritrean soldiers, all\nEPLF veterans, on the ground, after the war between the two countries\nhad reached its destructive peak:\nDuring 1997, the Woyane authorities did not send soldiers directly, but\nrather militia, coming into Eritrean territory and telling farmers that this is\nTigray . . . The Tigrayan people around the contested areas did not take\ntheir own initiative, but were directed by the Woyane government, who\ncompelled them to commit atrocities and spread destruction. For example,\nonce Tigrayan villagers came in buses ... crossed the border, came to the\nEritrean village, and told the villagers, 'This is not your area, go and tell your\ngovernment it does not belong to you.' This was in Badme in 1997.\nTigrayans and Eritreans around the border were engaged in trade, mutual\nactivities; but the Tigrayan authorities told people to do what the militia was\ndoing, destroying the harvest and so on. It was deliberately done, ordered by\ngovernment. This was done in order to terrorise the Eritrean people, in other\nwords to turn the Eritrean people against their own government.38\nThe perception on the ground that the eruption of war in 1998 was\nwholly predictable is further underlined:\n. . . right from the beginning of the conflict, although Ethiopia called it a\n'border conflict', it has been clear to me that Ethiopia would go beyond it. I\nwas in the border areas before May 1998; Tigrayans were committing\natrocities against Eritreans. For me it was clear that the Woyane wanted to\noverthrow the Eritrean government and replace it with a satellite. I knew this\nall along. I was in Badme before May 1998. I was there when the Tigrayans\n37 See for example 'Joint Communique of the First Round-Table Meeting of the Ethio-\nEritrea Joint Ministeral Commission, 22-27 September 1993, Asmara', and 'Extract from\nFinal Report of the Joint Review Committee on the Implementation of the Ethio-Eritrea\nEconomic Agreements, Addis Ababa, 1 January 1997', Appendices 1 and 2 in Tekeste and\nTronvoll (2000: 105-14). Several years earlier, indeed, the EPLF had talked of possible future\n'confederation' as a means of dealing with the problem of an ethnic group which straddled\nboth countries, although the concept of 'confederation' was not at that time elaborated upon\n(RDC Ace. No. 05062\/Rela\/3, pp. 20-1; see also the Eritrea Profile newspaper from 1994\nonwards, passim.).\n38 Interviewed by the author: Simon Berhane, Adi Nefas, Eritrea, 20 July 2000. It is a\nmatter of some debate whether these kinds of activities were instigated autonomously by local\nauthorities, or whether they actually were directed by central government. In any case, the\ninformant is referring here to the arrival of Tigrayan militia in the Badme area in July 1997, as\nthey also did in the area of Bada (Adi Murug) at the same time. This led to the first exchange\nof letters, mild in tone, between the Eritrean President and Ethiopian Prime Minister. See\nAppendix 3 in Tekeste and Tronvoll (2000: 115-6).\nERITREAN RELATIONS WITH TIGRAY 393\nwere crossing the border in 1997, when the Tigrayans were removing the\nharvest and expelling Eritrean farmers. 39\nFor sure, the strength of emotion of these assertions to a very large\ndegree reflects the anger felt at the full-scale Ethiopian invasion in May\n2000 and, subsequently, the serious military setbacks suffered by the\nEritreanarmy. Readers may also, if they choose, ignore the anti-\nEthiopian remarks. But the essential point here is to emphasise the\ndegree to which misunderstandings and tensions were seen to be\ncommonplace in the areas which, as we have described, had been\ndisputed since the late 1970s. While clearly the informants themselves\nwill naturally have chosen to direct their anger at the Ethiopian\ngovernment, the author again sensed that underlying this outward\nemotion was anger at the failure of the Eritrean government to resolve\nthese problems before they became as catastrophic as they did between\n1998 and 2000. Perhaps we can extend this outwards, and consider\nmore broadly the frustration that many ordinary Eritreans will have felt\nin terms of the problematic relationship with their southerly neighbours\nin its entirety.\nSome had longer memories than others, as is underlined by one\nEPLF veteran who was with the TPLF in Addis Ababa in 1991:\nI met some Tigrayan friends whom I had known in Sahel, and I was able to\nobserve their feelings toward Eritrea. They were saying, 'We have control of\nEthiopia, but we are landlocked, we need a port . . . Once we are stabilised,\nour focus will be on Eritrea, we will get a port, and Ethiopia will be the\nstrongest country in Mrica.' So this is not a border dispute. From my point\nof view, before May 1998, Tigrayan atrocities and incursions were laying the\nfoundations for later aggression. A border conflict is easy to solve according\nto colonial maps. The Tigr~an aim, rather, is to invade and control Eritrea,\noverthrow the government. 0\nUltimately, the questions of nationality and regional identity have\nprimacy as well as deep roots; the question of borders is secondary to,\nalthough clearly a reflection of, these unresolved issues.41\nSOME CONCLUSIONS\nThe study of relations between Eritrea and Tigray reveals much about\nthe current and historical relationship between Eritrea and Ethiopia\n39 Interview by the author: Battalion Commander (name withheld on request), Adi Nefas,\nEritrea, 19 July 2000.\n40 Interviewed by the author: Simon Berhane, Adi Nefas, Eritrea, 20 July 2000.\n41 It is worth noting that the idea that border problems were secondary to the larger issue of\nEritrean-Ethiopian relations was reiterated by a number of Ethiopian prisoners of war,\nTigrayan and non-Tigrayan, interviewed by the author in September 2000. These sources, of\ncourse, cannot be regarded as wholly reliable: although the author endeavoured to conduct the\ninterviews in as scientific a manner as was possible under the unusual circumstances, an\nEritrean army officer was always present.\n394 ERITREAN RELATIONS WITH TIGRAY\nmore generally, and goes some way to shedding light on the 1998-2000\nwar between the two countries. It seems reasonable to suppose that,\nhad the incidents of May 1998 never happened, the wider relationship\nbetween Eritrea and Ethiopia would have remained, at least for a time,\nlargely outside scrutiny. It is now a matter of some urgency, and not\nonly because of the ferocity and intensity of the war which has recently\nabated. It is also important because it seems that the war itself was\nmisunderstood, misinterpreted and swamped in unhelpful cliches,\ndeliberately or through sheer ignorance divorced from a past which is\nstill very much the present in both countries. Professions of either\nnaIvety or cynicism among Eritreans with regard to their southerly\nneighbours are a reflection of the misunderstandings which have\ncharacterised the relationship in the past, continue to plague the\nrelationship today, and which will, in all probability, define relations for\nsome time to come. If interaction has been troubled in the past, recent\nevents will only have exacerbated these problems. While they may be\nresolved, to some degree, by the passing of time alone, other things\nremaining equal, it is nonetheless very likely that serious and conscious\nefforts will need to be made on both sides to bridge the divide. It must\nalso be pointed out that, as far as Eritrea is concerned, the presumed\nunpredictability of relations with Ethiopia has had a truly detrimental\ndomestic impact, with Eritrean society now militarised to a saddening\nand deeply damaging degree. The siege mentality which served the\nEPLF well in the field has now solidified in government, no doubt in\npart owing to the organisation's peculiarly solipsistic ethos, but equally\nstemming from a long and troubled history with the country's southerly\nneighbour.\nMuch of what has been discussed in this paper raises the question of\nthe degree of 'inevitability' which attended the outbreak of war in 1998,\nand indeed the problematic nature of the relationship in the liberation\nwar era and of Eritrean-Tigrayan relations more broadly. Could things,\ncrudely put, have been different? On one level, the question might be,\nwhy did the struggle against the Derg across the whole of what was then\nnorthern Ethiopia prove fissiparous? Part of the answer lies in the\nnature of Eritrea as a territorial entity, namely, its distinctly colonial,\nun-Ethiopian history and the identity (or identities) which that past had\nengendered, as first clearly expressed in the 1940s; and the other part of\nthe answer lies in the EPLF itself. From the Ethiopian point ofview, the\nEPLF hijacked history: the movement recognised quite swiftly that only\na powerful strain of intransigence could get them where they wanted to\ngo, namely, complete and unconditional Eritrean independence. The\nresoluteness of the Eritrean struggle contrasts with the much more\nequivocal, and in many ways much more difficult, position of the TPLF\nin Ethiopia. Both were products of their respective modern geopolitical\nand historical environments; their physical adjacency and cultural\ncommonality, reflecting a deeper shared history, have only tended to\nblur our vision of more modern realities and positions. In other words,\nit essentially misses the point to regard the struggle, and relations more\nbroadly, as 'fissiparous'. These were different wars: the Eritreans' war\nERITREAN RELATIONS WITH TIGRAY 395\nwas not that of Tigray, nor was the Tigrayans' war that of Eritrea. It\nnever was, nor, as long as the EPLF's vision of Eritrea prevailed, could\nit ever be. This made it 'easier', if we can use the word, when it came to\nfighting each other; and perhaps, to some degree, given that the\nguidelines of non-negotiability had already been laid down during the\nliberation war, compromise was slow to make an appearance when war\ncame again in 1998. Our new question should be, finally, not 'could it\nhave been different?' but 'could it happen elsewhere in Africa?' For,\nalthough the identities examined here are products of the unique\ncrucible that is the Horn, forged in the first instance within the\nEthiopian empire or at least in the long shadows of that empire, the\nevents of this region are perhaps chilling reminders of what might have\nbeen, and might yet be, elsewhere: uncompromising nationalism,\nsensitivities heightened to the point of hysteria, local and regional\nhistories made and in the making, wars over the past as much as the\npresent.\nWhile problems over boundaries, festering as they have done over the\npast two decades or more, can be seen to have been the catalyst for\nconflict, they should also be seen as having been secondary in\nimportance to the much larger and more explosive questions of\nnationality, ethnicity and unity. As Eritreans have repeatedly claimed,\nborders can easily be demarcated and the problem promptly removed\n(even though the EPLF demurred on this during the liberation\nstruggle). But they have simultaneously been aware that this is not,\nand never has been, the core issue, which is precisely why they found\nthemselves at war. By this tok\"en, the war of 1998-2000 might have\nbeen anticipated; indeed, one may safely assume that in fact it was, but\nby individuals whose positions in public life (however inappropriate\nthat term may be in the context of the secrecy and conservatism of\nEritrean and Ethiopian politics) prevented them from saying so, even\nwhile these same positions should have empowered the individuals\nthemselves to pre-empt its outbreak. These errors of judgement, if this\nis indeed how we can intepret them, cannot be undone. While some\nmight argue that some form of armed conflict was in fact necessary in\nthe shaping of regional identities-in the confirmation of Eritrean\nindependence, but by the same token in a serious modification to the\ndangerous myth of Eritrean military invincibility-it should now be\nclear that any future conflict, which cannot be completely ruled out,\nwould be wholly futile. Neither side stands to gain; on the contrary,\nboth EPLF and TPLF might find their internal power-bases\nsignificantly weakened, which would be an ironic conclusion indeed\nto this entire saga. It would not, however, be the end of the story.\n396 ERITREAN RELATIONS WITH TIGRAY\nAPPENDIX\nNOTE: This is intended as a brief guide to terms, names and background\nhistory for non-specialist readers.\nDerg. Amharic for 'committee'. It became the popular name for the\npost-imperial and supposedly Marxist Ethiopian regime which lasted\nfrom 1974, when Emperor Haile Sellassie was deposed, until 1991\nwhen it collapsed with the arrival in Addis Ababa of EPRDF and EPLF\nforces. Initially, the Derg was officially known as the Provisional\nMilitary Administration Council (PMAC) and, later, the People's\nDemocratic Republic of Ethiopia (PDRE). From 1977 until 1991, the\nhead of the Derg and dictator of Ethiopia was Col. Mengistu Haile\nMariam. Mengistu refused to contemplate a negotiated settlement to\nthe Eritrean or any other question related to 'secession' or autonomy,\nand presided over several major military offensives against both EPLF\nand TPLF, with Soviet assistance, from the late 1970s through to the\nmid-1980s. See also 'Strategic withdrawal' below.\nELF. The Eritrean Liberation Front (ELF) was the first movement of\narmed resistance during the Eritrean liberation struggle, initiating\nguerrilla war against imperial Ethiopia in September 1961 as the armed\nwing of the Eritrean Liberation Movement (ELM), which was in exile.\nPredominantly Muslim and based in the western lowlands, it none-\ntheless attracted a number of highland Christian recruits by the end of\nthe 1960s, including a core of future leaders of the EPLF. Religious,\norganisational and ideological tensions within the ELF, however, led to\nthe breakaway of several-predominantly Christian-led-groups at the\nbeginning of the 1970s; a number of these later amalgamated to form\nthe Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF) by 1974. The ELF and\nEPLF fought one another sporadically through the 1970s, although\nthere were also periods of cease-fire and military co-operation.\nHowever, full-scale civil war between the movements erupted in\nearnest at the end of the 1970s, and led, by 1981, to the expulsion of the\nELF from Eritrean soil. The ELF continued to function politically in\nexile, although it underwent further fragmentation in the decade prior\nto independence, with some former members joining the EPLF as late\nas 1990. Today, members of the former ELF live both in Eritrea and in\nexile in Europe and North America, where some of them purport to\nrepresent opposition to the current Eritrean government.\nEPLF. Formed by an amalgam of disenchanted former members of the\nELF in the early 1970s, the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF)\nwas predominantly led by, and composed of, Tigrinya-speaking\nhighland Christians but also sought to recruit beyond the highland\nprovinces of Eritrea. Purportedly secular, it adopted Marxist rhetoric\n(and a number of apparently Marxist policies) in its early years, and\nsought to bring about a popular and inclusive revolution, regarding\ncampaigns in health care and literacy programmes in rural areas as part\nand parcel of that revolution, alongside the physical struggle with\nEthiopian 'colonialism'. Structured according to the principles of\nERITREAN RElATIONS WITH TIGRAY 397\ndemocratic centralism, it was a highly disciplined and remarkably\neffective military, social and political force; it succeeded in expelling its\nolder rival, the ELF, from the field by 1981, securing for itself the\nposition of the sole movement representing the Eritrean people inside\nEritrea. After its strategic withdrawal (see below) to the north of Eritrea\nin the late 1970s, it survived several fierce Ethiopian offensives before\ngoing on the offensive in the mid-1980s, combining both guerrilla and\nconventional means of warfare. The EPLF broke out of its northern\nstronghold in 1988 with the capture of the town of Afabet, and in the\nnext two years overran much of the country with the exception of\nseveral besieged Ethiopian urban garrisons; in 1991 it entered Asmara,\nsimultaneously assisting the TPLF in the capture of Addis Ababa, and\nset up the Provisional Government of Eritrea. Having overseen a\nresoundingly successful referendum for Eritrean independence in 1993,\nthe following year it reformulated itself as the People's Front for\nDemocracy and Justice (PFDD, which is the EPLF in all but name.\nThe PFDJ remains the sole legal, and of course ruling, party in Eritrea,\nwhile almost all members of the Eritrean government, from the\nPresident downward, are former EPLF fighters.\nEPRDF. The Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front\n(EPRDF) was the name given to the umbrella organisation which allied\nthe TPLF with a myriad of other anti-Derg movements, representing a\nbroad spectrum of opinion, ethnic and linguistic backgrounds, at the\nend of the 1980s. EPRDF forces captured Addis Ababa, only days after\nthe EPLF had entered Asmara, in 1991 and the movement became the\nbasis for the new coalition government of Ethiopia.\nEPRP. The Ethiopian People's Revolutionary.Party (EPRP) emerged\nin the mid-1970s as one of the main opposition movements against the\nDerg, and one of the most radical, advocating popular elections,\nmobilising both peasantry and proletariat, and accepting in principle\nthe right of secession. However the movement argued that it would be\npreferable for the peoples of Ethiopia to unite and construct a nation\norganised around cultural autonomy. Relations with the TPLF were\ntense-indeed the TPLF prohibited the EPRP from operating inside\nTigray-but some military assistance came from the EPLF. The\nmovement was quickly crushed by the Derg, with the connivance of\nsome rival opposition groups distrustful of its ideology, although some\nmembers scattered into other movements.\nStrategic withdrawal. A pivotal point in the history of the Eritrean\nliberation struggle, this refers to the decision by the EPLF leadership to\nwithdraw its forces from their positions across central and southern\nEritrea to the northern mountains in the province of Sahel. The\ndecision was taken in the face of new Soviet-backed Ethiopian\noffensives from 1977 to 1979. While it involved abandoning positions\nwhich had been held for several years, and which .had seemed to\npromise the imminent liberation of Eritrea, the withdrawal to an almost\n398 ERITREAN RELATIONS WITH TIGRAY\nimpenetrable rear base undoubtedly saved the EPLF from almost\ncertain destruction as a fighting force.\nTigray. The northernmost province of Ethiopia, inhabited by\npredominantly Tigrinya (see below) speaking people, and therefore\nsharing much in the way of culture, language and history with adjacent\nhighland Eritrea. Tigray is presented in much of the literature on the\nregion as forming the historic heartland of ancient 'Abyssinia', although\nin recent centuries it has become increasingly marginal to the Amhara-\ndominated power centres to the south, Emperor Yohannes IV (1872-\n89) being its last 'Abyssinian' ruler (and the first for some time before\nthat). This, indeed, is one of the core themes running through modem\nTigrayan nationalism, which first makes an appearance in the 1940s but\nwhich becomes much more forceful in the 1970s with the rise of the\nTPLF (see below). One of the key dilemmas for Tigrayan nationalist\nleaders, reflecting in some ways its disadvantageous position within the\nmodem Ethiopian state, has been the question of whether to press for\noutright independence, or to reclaim its 'rightful' status inside Ethiopia.\nGiven the close relationship between the two regions, either of these\noptions has been bound to have a major impact on Eritrea.\nTigrinya. The dominant language of highland Eritrea and much of\nTigray, and therefore shared by the EPLF and the TPLF. The term can\nalso be used to refer to culture and custom in the same areas.\nTLF. An early Tigrayan nationalist movement, the Tigray Liberation\nFront (TLF) was linked to the ELF but was too weak and ill-organised\nto survive subsequent ELF-EPLF-TPLF machinations in the mid- and\nlate-1970s. The TPLF was swift to crush the movement, expelling\nsome members and absorbing others.\nTPLF. The Tigrayan People's Liberation Front emerged in 1974-5,\nand enjoyed support from the EPLF. By the late 1970s it was the\ndominant movement in Tigrayan nationalist politics, having largely\ncleared the field of both local and pan-Ethiopian rivals. A primarily\nguerrilla movement, generally eschewing conventional warfare until the\nlate 1980s, it was deeply rooted in the Tigrayan peasantry although its\nleaders were mostly middle class and educated and, like the EPLF,\ndabbled in Marxism in thought if not always in deed. It grew in military\nstrength and political confidence and by the late 1980s had come to\nregard itself as in the vanguard of a popular Ethiopian revolution. By\nthis time it had cleared Ethiopian forces from Tigray, and was\ninstrumental in the formation of the broad coalition EPRDF (see\nabove), in which the TPLF itself was dominant. This movement\ncaptured Addis Ababa in 1991 and the TPLF was positioned at the\nheart of the new government charged with the reconstruction of\nEthiopia. It remains a dominant part of the coalition government.\nERITREAN RELATIONS WITH TIGRAY\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n399\nMuch of the research for this paper was done when the author was Assistant Professor of\nHistory at the University of Asmara, Eritrea (1997-2002).

The\nEPLF won independence for Eritrea in 1991, at the same time as the TPLF\nseized power in Ethiopia; the two movements had had a difficult relationship,\nbeginning in the mid-1970s, during their respective armed struggles, and the\nissues which had caused disagreement remained unresolved as the movements\nmade the transition to government. This paper examines the nature of those\nissues and the degree to which the war of 1998-2000 between the two\ncountries can be seen to have reflected much older tensions and indeed\ncontradictions in the Eritrean-TigrayaniEthiopian relationship. Thus, the\npaper begins with an overview of Eritrean opinion, during the recent war, about\nthe relationship in question, and then moves back in time to the era of the\nliberation struggle. Here, the author attempts to explain the complexities of the\nrespective Eritrean and Tigrayan revolutions insofar as each impinged on and\ninfluenced the other, with particular reference to the issues of frontiers,\nnationality and ethnicity, and sovereignty. The paper, finally, considers the\napparent paradoxes in the perceptions which Eritreans have of Tigray and\nEthiopia, and suggests that changes in attitude are necessary on both sides of\nthe Mereb river border if the relationship is not to be defined by perpetual\nconfrontation.\nRESUME\nCet article examine la relation problematique entre l'Erythree et Ie Tigray, tel\nque les representent l'EPLF et Ie TPLF. L'EPLF (Front populaire de\nliberation de l'Erythree) a obtenu l'independance de l'Erythree en 1991, au\nmoment ou Ie TPLF (Front populaire de liberation du Tigray) prenait Ie\npouvoir en Ethiopie ; des Ie milieu des annees 1970, ces deux mouvements ont\nentretenu des rapports difficiles durant leurs luttes armees respectives, et les\nobjets de desaccord etaient toujours irresolus au moment ou ces mouvements\nsont arrives au pouvoir. Cet article examine la nature de ces desaccords et dans\nqueUe mesure la guerre de 1998-2000 entre les deux pays a pu refleter des\nERITREAN RELATIONS WITH TIGRAY 401\ntensions beaucoup plus anciennes et des contradictions dans la relation\nErythree-Tigray\/Ethiopie. L'article commence par etudier l'opinion\nerythreenne sur la relation en question au cours de la recente guerre, puis\nremonte jusqu' a la periode de la lutte pour la liberation. L'auteur tente\nd'expliquer la complexite des revolutions erythreenne et tigreenne dans la\nmesure ou chacune affecte et influence l'autre, concernant notamment les\nproblemes de frontieres, de nationalite et ethnicite, et de souverainete. Pour\nfinir, l'article evoque les paradoxes apparents de l'idee que se font les\nErythreens du Tigray et de l'Ethiopie, et suggere qu'un changement de\ncomportement devra s'operer de part et d'autre du Mereb, fleuve frontiere,\npour que la relation cesse de se definir par une confrontation perpetuelle.\n"}
