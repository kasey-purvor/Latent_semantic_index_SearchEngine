A particular \nversion of inter-firm learning is the use of supply chains as a mechanism for upgrading and \ntransferring 'best practice' and this paper reports on exploratory research on this theme.  It draws \non a literature survey and a detailed study of six supply chains at various stages of implementing \nsupply chain learning. \n  \nIntroduction \n \nManufacturing is no longer simply a business of transformation of inputs into outputs through the \nuse of standard equipment and techniques.  Rather, as the recent White Paper on UK \nCompetitiveness has pointed out, sustainable growth depends on the ability to master the \nknowledge content in production and this can only be achieved by developing the capacity to \nlearn along the whole spectrum of economic activities.  Best-practice is thus not a one-off \u201chit\u201d, \nbut rather building up the capacity to change. \n \nThis places considerable emphasis on the ability of the firm to and to continue to learn to keep \npace with an environment filled with competitive threats and new technological opportunities.  \nHowever, the challenge does not stop at the boundaries of the firm. It is also becoming clear that \nmany firms operate within value streams involving many firms in a supply chain or network \u2013 \nand the competitive performance of this value stream depends upon learning and the development \nof the whole system, not just the leading players. \n \nOne approach which offers potential as a mechanism to enable learning and competence \ndevelopment is the supply chain, and this paper explores the extent to which this could become a \nviable approach within the UK.  There are several good reasons for believing this might represent \na vehicle for effective transfer, including the following: \n \n\uf071 there is a commonality of interest, focused on delivering value to a particular customer, and \nimprovement of this core process along a supply chain \n \n\uf071 as a consequence of an increasingly competitive global environment, there is (potentially) a \ngrowing motivation to learn \n \n\uf071 there are potential benefits to sharing the learning experience, including risk reduction, \ntransfer of ideas, shared experiment, etc. \n \nBut, as a recent UK government report indicates, \u2018learning is not a natural feature of business \nnetworks.  It is unlikely to thrive unless it is part of the emergent new models for inter-company \ncollaboration which stress trust, co-operation and mutual dependence\u2019 (2000). \n \nThe learning problem \n \nResearch suggests that there are two important components involved in such learning; the first \ninvolves the accumulation and development of a core knowledge base - the \u2018core competence\u2019 - \nwhich differentiates the firm from others and offers the potential for competitive advantage.  \nAcquiring this is not simply a matter of purchasing or trading knowledge assets but the \nsystematic and purposive learning and construction of a knowledge base. (Prahalad and Hamel \n1994; Teece 1998) \n \nThe second is the long-term development of a capability for learning and continuous \nimprovement across the whole organisation. Recognition of this need has led to growing \nemphasis on the concept of \u2018learning organisations\u2019 and on the mechanisms through which this \ncapability can be developed (Cohen and Levinthal 1990; Garvin 1993; Bowen, Clark et al. 1994; \nLeonard-Barton 1995; Senge 1999) .  These include intra-firm processes, and those which \ninvolve relationships between firms \u2013 for example, in the context of supply chains.  (Hines 1994; \nDyer and Nobeoka 2000) \n \nLearning in organisations is not automatic and there are a number of points at which learning \nfails to happen unless a blockage is dealt with.  Such difficulties have led to exploration of \nmechanisms and structures which can support or facilitate learning - and one of these is the idea \nof inter-firm shared learning (Bessant and Tsekouras 2000). The potential benefits of such \nlearning include mutual support, risk reduction through shared experimentation, exposure to \ndifferent perspectives and challenging reflection on progress (Dent 2001). \n \nSupply chains as an option for enabling learning \n \nIn considering the potential for supply chain learning we need to recognise the different \ncomponents which make up apparent \u2018best practice\u2019 and which might be transferred via this \nmechanism.  These range from relatively simple, incremental additions to a current knowledge \nset \u2013 for example, new regulations \u2013 through to complex new approaches which will involve \nexperiment and adaptation.  Work by the Tavistock Institute (Holti and Whittle 1998) examining \n\u2018learning networks\u2019 in the construction industry suggest a distinction between \u2018operational \nlearning\u2019 and \u2018strategic learning\u2019. \n \nIn similar fashion we need to recognise that there are different modes in which supply chain \nlearning can be enabled.  At one level it can involve a one-to-one relationship between two \nplayers in a chain \u2013 for example, a customer and a key supplier.  At the other end of the spectrum \nfrom such dyadic relationships are multi-firm groupings \u2013 clusters or networks \u2013 where there is \nsome element of shared learning  - for example, a supplier club involving all or a large proportion \nof suppliers to a particular firm.  In between we might have gradations \u2013 for example, into levels \nof multi-firm involvement (such as a customer firm working with a group of two or three \nsuppliers to develop a new way of working.  An example of this is provided by Guinness, who \ndeveloped their \u2018real-time supply techniques, working with a bottle producer, label manufacturer \nand packaging suppliers). \n \nResearch base \n \nIn order to explore the issue of SCL and its potential for facilitating learning we carried out a \ntwo-phase research project on behalf of the UK Department of Trade and Industry.  (The partners \nfor this were CENTRIM, CRiSPS and IBM Consulting).  Phase 1 involved a literature survey and \nselected interviews to review experience worldwide with SCL and phase 2 extended this work \nwith further 'expert' interviews, a telephone survey of 25 organisations and detailed case studies \nof six supply chains.   Our selection of these was driven partly by a view that they represented \nrelatively advanced sectors in terms of supplier relationship development activities and in many \ncases had some explicit sector-wide programmes operating to foster SCL \u2013 for example, SCRIA \nin aerospace and CRINE and its successor programmes in the oil and gas industry.  (Kaplinsky, \nBessant et al. 1999; UKOGI 1999) \n \nThe six value chains chosen for detailed investigation represented different types of value chains, \nand encompassed a range of sectors and different types of firms. The chains were: \n \n\u2022 Semiconductor industry equipment \n\u2022 The production of tubular structures for the oil and gas industry  \n\u2022 The computing equipment industry \n\u2022 Two different chains in the chemicals industry \n\u2022 The aerospace industry \n \nIn addition, a workshop was held in London involving the participation of a number of public and \nprivate sector stakeholders and interviews were held with senior executives in the brewing, \nconfectionery, the Northern Ireland aerospace industry and the surface finishing sectors. \n \nA model of supply chain learning \n \nIn order to analyse our empirical data we have used a model of supply chain learning which \nsuggests a number of generally sequential steps. This is an \u2018ideal type\u2019 model and involves the \nfollowing stages (Table 1), usually (but not always) completed in a series of sequential steps: \n \nTable 1: Steps in the Evolution of Supply Chain Learning \n \n1. A \u201cwake up call\u201d, with the drivers varying in different sectors and in different parts of the world \n \n2. The adoption of new organisational procedures within firms in response to this wake-up call (mainly in the \nquality and materials management areas) \n \n3. These internal changes are soon recognised to be of limited effectiveness unless the supply chain (and indeed the \ncustomer base) simultaneously undergoes complementary changes \n \n4. The rationalisation of the vendor base (or the customer base), so that these complementary changes can more \neasily be implemented and synchronised  \n \n5. The communication to vendors (and customers) of the new requirements which changing market conditions \nrequire \n \n6. Mandating change in behaviour among suppliers (and customers)  \n \n7. Assisting suppliers (and customers) to achieve these new performance levels in their own activities in the design \nof a SCL programme, its running and in sustaining it over time \n \n8. Assisting suppliers (and customers) to aid their own suppliers (and customers) in similar processes of change in \nthe various tiers of the chain \n \n9. Developing the ability to learn from suppliers and customers, not just to teach them  \n \n \nIt can readily be seen from this that SCL (the transfer of \u2018best practice\u2019 through the supply chain) \nis only part of a wider process of change as firms adjust to the pressures of international \ncompetition. Similarly, in proceeding through these (generally sequential) stages, a key break \noccurs at Stage 7: it is here that SCL, generally involving active coordination by one or more key \nlinks in the chain, truly begins \n \nFrom the research it appears that there are three distinct phases in the development of SCL \u2013 set-\nup, running (i.e. the operation of the SCL programme) and long-term sustaining.  The first set-up \nphase involves the establishment of a set of procedures to promote SCL.  However, once these \nprocedures have been established - the \u2018running phase\u2019 - the challenge then is to ensure that they \nare translated into a set of routines and norms which govern the behaviour between and within \nfirms, and this forms the basis of the second phase.  \n \nThe problem is that once these routines and norms have been established - often involving \nchanging behaviour by individuals and firms - there is a natural tendency for behaviour to return \nto traditional patterns. Therefore, a third and important stage in SCL involves the ability to \nsustain these activities, and not to allow them to degrade and lose impetus.  \n \nResults \n \nDespite our selection of case studies from what are generally regarded as relatively advanced \nsectors (in terms of supply chain development activity) it can be seen from Table 2 that most \nsupply chain management programmes do not yet incorporate SCL. Where SCL does occur, it is \nmostly limited to the first tier suppliers (or customers), and very seldom involves structured \nprocesses of learning from suppliers (or customers).  If these relatively progressive chains have \nnot yet systematically addressed the challenge of SCL, then there is clearly much opportunity for \nimprovement in the UK economy. It may be worth adding that those companies that are trying to \nexpand the SCL further down the chain are finding this task difficult. \n \n.

In most cases, supply chain \ndevelopment has effectively only reached the stage of mandating performance improvement \nrather than in assisting change within suppliers. In those cases where SCL programmes have been \nput in motion, the pace of change has been steady rather than dramatic.  \n \nFor example, in the case of equipment for the semiconductor industry, although the key supply \nchain co-ordinator firm (SCC) began working in the early 1990s, change is predominantly still \nonly occurring in the first tier. The second and third tiers are only beginning a process of change, \nand indeed the drivers to change at this level of the chain come as much from below as they do \nfrom above. Moreover, the changes, which are occurring, are predominantly limited to \nimprovements in logistics, and even then some of this involves an increase rather than decrease in \ntotal inventories (with the major rewards being experienced in security and reliability of \ndelivery). \n \nIn contrast however, the aerospace example shows that indeed the focus is still based around first \ntier suppliers but the changes brought about within these suppliers are owned by the suppliers and \nare not mandated. The suppliers own the continuous improvement plan that is jointly developed \nwith the SCC and the sole responsibility for selection and implementation of improvement \nremains with the supplier. \n \nThere are a number of factors driving the introduction of SCL. For example in the case of \nsemiconductor equipment, the primary drivers at to the onset of change were technological in \nnature, involving a fundamental change in the design of the equipment. However, these \ntechnological imperatives were complemented initially by sustained pressure on pricing and then \non the ability to satisfy wildly fluctuating volumes of production. The major driver towards SCL \nfrom the mid-1990s has been to assure reliable suppliers of components to counter fluctuations in \ndemand (which can be up to 70 per cent on a month-to-month basis). \n \nSet up, Running and Sustaining SCL \n \nTable 3 highlights examples from the case firms on how these firms set up, ran and sustained \ntheir SCL programmes.  \n \nTable 3: Implementing SCL Programmes in the Six Value Chains \n \n SCL Driver  Setting up Running Sustaining \nSemi- equip Improving \nsupplier quality \nThe pilot scheme \nbegan with local firms \nand with suppliers \nwith a high transaction \ncost \n \n \nTeams were set up \nwith equal numbers \nfrom Semi-equip and \nsupplier.

Most cases \nreported some learning by the 1st tier supplier from the lead firm, and even a case of the co-\nordinating firm learning from a 1st tier supplier. However, further along the supply chain, learning \nactivities among suppliers and customers is more limited. The control of the co-ordinating firm is \nnot so strong at the 2nd and 3rd tiers (except in the case of the computer manufacturer). Table 4 \nhighlights several learning points we found in the case studies.  \n \nTable 4: Learning Points in the Six Value Chains \n \n Supply Chain Learning \nSemi- Equip Evidence of the development of learning capabilities in one of the first-tier suppliers. \nProblem solving techniques were used by suppliers forming teams together with staff from \nthe customers.  But, in important respects, the SCC is itself a poor role model and learning \nis thus limited within the first tier \n \nO+G Constant dialog between the customer and the suppliers has led to better understanding \namong all parties. Day-to-day work activities generate issues which are then incorporated \ninto the strategic issues.  \n \nSupply chain issues are moving from practices related to material management toward soft \nones such as services. \n \nSupplier recognise that a two-way learning process has occurred with a) SCC adopting \nsome of the suppliers techniques and \u2018b) the supplier taking on practices first used by the \nSCC. \n \nComputer The SCC establishes a set of standardised evaluations that are applicable to all suppliers. \nThis tool is used to benchmark all suppliers providing similar inputs. The results are \ncommunicated to all suppliers This practice gives clear advantage to the SCC during the \nbargaining processes. \n \nNo system implemented to measure the performance of the entire chain. \n \nCreation of the supplier alliance improved relationship between all the suppliers and the \nchemical company enabling improved information transfer and understanding of \nrequirements. \n \nChemical A Supplier alliance may prove to have a long-term benefit to suppliers (too early to \ndetermine). \n \nThe concept of a supplier alliance is very useful in the transportation industry and there are \nprospects of transferring the initiative within the industry. \n \nChemical B  Customer introduced 6 sigma SPC into SCC\u2019s manufacturing plants. This was not a \nstructured mechanism of transferring best practice but a one-off occurrence. \n \nChemical B does not want to be responsible for passing initiatives beyond their direct \ncustomers or 1st tier suppliers. \n \nAerospace The business assessments highlights areas for improvements and suggested tools and \ntechniques that can be used to satisfy these requirements. Suppliers were able to \nimplement changes. \n \nSome suppliers have transferred the Business Assessment into a Continuous Improvement \nPlan. The supplier takes ownership of the plan and is responsible for delivery. \n \nSuppliers have not taken a consistent approach towards disseminating tools and techniques \nor lessons learnt to their own suppliers and do not feel responsible for dissemination to \ntheir second and third tier suppliers \n \n \n \nHave Companies benefited from SCL? \n \nTable 5 lists several of the benefits firms

within and between organisations will be a key strategic \nrequirement for building and sustaining future competitiveness.  Experience from a variety of \ncountries suggests that inter-firm learning (organised in various forms) can provide positive \nsupport for this process and yield beneficial results.  But, as these case studies and the \naccompanying research show, progress towards achieving SCL is still at an early stage and being \nmade with faltering steps.  There is clearly a need for more research in the field and for more \nexperimentation towards developing firm and sector-specific models.  (There are signs that this is \nbeginning to accelerate; the perceived success of initiatives like CRINE in the oil and gas sector, \nSCRIA in aerospace and the SMMT Industry Forum in the automotive components sector has led \nto a government-supported roll-out of such initiatives as part of the policies following the 1999 \nWhite Paper). \n \nIn conclusion we would highlight four themes which require more detailed analysis and \ndevelopment: \n \n\u2022 The importance of implementing SCL on a platform of 'good practice' supplier management \n(and the need to review such programmes to add the SCL dimension) \n \n\u2022 The concept of supply chain 'governance' and the roles which can be played by different \nactors in the SCL network  \n \n\u2022 The role of facilitation and the skill sets and enabling toolkit which permit effective learning \nnetworks of the kind reported here to evolve \n \n\u2022 Processes through which a shared learning agenda (and related 'curriculum', assessment \nframeworks, etc.) can be developed.  Early evidence suggests this needs to take place at a \nsector or supply chain level - for example, via business associations  \n \n  \n \n \nReferences \n \n(2000).
