It is based on a survey \ncarried out on a sample of higher educational institutions within London, UK. A qualitative \nresearch approach, using semi-structured interviews, is applied to assess a) how far the \nrelevant institutions have reached with respect to greening within the areas of energy and \nsolid waste management, b) what the interviewees consider to be the most important barriers \nto further green their campuses, and (c) how such barriers can be reduced, or possibly \novercome. The study maintains that although the institutions are not at ground zero with \nrespect to greening, their overall environmental quality is relatively poor, particularly \nconcerning recycling. It is argued that the barrier suggested to be of greatest significance by \nthe interviewees, namely budgetary constrains, is at least partly due to a lack of knowledge \nconcerning how greening initiatives can save costs as well as an institutional reluctance to \nchange. It is concluded therefore that one of the most important measures that needs to be \nundertaken to overcome barriers to greening is to raise the environmental awareness within \ncampus communities. \n \nKeywords Waste management, Energy management, Sustainability, Environmental \nawareness, Financial constraints, Cultural barriers \n \n \n \nIntroduction \n \nThe greening of higher educational institutions can be defined as the process of reducing the \nmultitude of on- and off-site environmental impacts resulting from campus decisions and \nactivities, as well as raising environmental awareness within the human communities of a \ncollege or university (Creighton, 1999).  \n \n 3 \nIn a time faced with increasing environmental challenges, the tertiary sector is being \nrecognised as well suited to take on the leadership for environmental protection (Leal Filho et \nal. 1996, p. v). By greening their own campuses, higher educational (HE) institutions can \nteach and demonstrate the principles of awareness and stewardship of the natural world, as \nwell as increasing the chances of clean and pleasant local and global environments for the \nfuture (Creighton 1999, p. 6).  \n \nHowever, although several colleges and universities have started to understand and act upon \ntheir \u2018sustainable development responsibilities\u2019 (Khan 1996a, p.39) by implementing \nenvironmental concerns into their policies and day-to-day practices, a general trend both  \nwithin the USA and in Europe, is that few HE institutions are vigorously pursuing greening \ninitiatives throughout their campus operations. There is still a long way to go before \nenvironmental education becomes an integrated part of higher educational institutions, and \nbefore the environmental impacts resulting from their practices have been reduced to \nacceptable levels (Smith, 1993).  \n \nEmpirical studies have suggested various reasons for why HE institutions may be reluctant to \nactively implement \u2018green\u2019 actions at their campuses (see, for example, Creighton (1999), \nRiera (1996), Leal Filho (1999, 2000), Van Ginkel (1996)). Causes mentioned are, among \nothers, misconceptions to the meaning of \u2018sustainable development\u2019, the lack of \nenvironmental interest among students and staff, university conservatism, and the extensive \ncosts associated with implementing green initiatives.  \n \nHowever, as the \u2018greening of higher educational institutions\u2019 is a complex and relatively new \nfield of research, further studies are probably needed  to be able to establish the various \nfactors causing the reluctance to greening, and thereby help HE institutions realise that \u2018going \ngreen\u2019 has numerous advantages. Leal Filho (2000, p. 193) suggests \u2018going into the specifics\u2019, \ni.e. dealing with specific issues and themes such as energy use and waste management, as one \npossible way of addressing the task of transforming colleges and universities into green \ninstitutions. As Leal Filho (2000, p. 193) indicates, \u2018such contexts have clear approaches and \nclear outcomes\u2019.  \n \nGoing \u2018into the specifics\u2019 is exactly what this study aims to do. It is motivated by a desire to \nexplore in more detail specific problems of the greening of HE process. The hope is that a \n 4 \nmore detailed knowledge about these problems will allow more informed recommendations \non ways to overcome barriers to greening. This study therefore examines solid waste1 and \nenergy2 management in HE institutions. The research is based on an overall evaluation of how \nfar a sample of higher educational institutions within London, UK, have reached with respect \nto greening within these areas. In the light of this survey, the study further aims to determine \nwhat the relevant institutions consider to be the most important barriers to greening within \nthese areas, and how such barriers can be reduced, or possibly overcome. The specific \ncomponents of campus greening, i.e. solid waste and energy management, were chosen \nbecause they are believed to be suitable and encouraging starting points for a greening \nprocess; they involve initiatives that are relatively easy to implement, with opportunities for \nfinancial payback. A successful implementation of such actions can therefore give a HE \ninstitution a positive impression of greening, and thereby catalyse the implementations of \nfurther greening initiatives. Furthermore, as the most significant university environmental \nimpacts are those resulting from campus waste and energy use, sustainable practices within \nthese areas can effectively prevent environmental degradation. Prudent energy and waste \nmanagement can also serve as a good example for students, teaching and demonstrating \nprinciples of environmental awareness and stewardship (Creighton 1999, p. 6). Of importance \nis also the fact that HE institutions, due to national and international targets set to reduce the \namounts of solid wastes and CO2 emissions, are likely to face increased regulatory and \npolitical pressures within these areas.  \n \nIt is hoped that the findings from this study can be of use to other HE institutions; both \nconcerning obstacles that might rise as well as measures for how difficulties can be reduced or \novercome, in a greening process.  \n \n                                                          \n1\n Solid waste management includes the various initiatives that can be undertaken to reduce the volumes of solid \nwaste on campus, such as reusing and recycling materials, composting, and source reduction (Keniry 1995). \n2\n Energy management includes the various initiatives that can be undertaken to promote energy conservation and \nimprove energy efficiency. Energy conservation implies various energy-saving measures that reduce energy use \nwithout overhauling technology, focusing rather on people and habits. Energy efficiency includes implementing \ntechnologies to provide comparable lighting, cooling, heating and so on, using less energy and spending less \nmoney (Keniry 1995). \n 5 \nWith these expectations and queries in mind, this paper tries to provide an answer to the \nfollowing questions: \n \n1. Within the areas of energy and solid waste management, how far have the sampled \ninstitutions reached with respect to greening?  \n \n2. What is considered to be the most important barriers to further greening, and how can \nsuch barriers be reduced or overcome?  \n \nTheoretical Foundation \nSustainable Development and Higher Educational Institutions \nThe now well established concept of sustainable development has been awarded much \nattention since it was first introduced in 1987. The question of how we can achieve a \n\u2018development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future \ngenerations to meet their own needs\u2019 (WCED, 1987), has been subject to lively debate at \nnumerous occasions.  \n \nA growing consensus of opinion is that the framework offered by sustainable development \ncannot only be a matter of concern at governmental level, but that all institutions, including \nthose of higher education, need to take an active part in the struggle to achieve this goal (Leal \nFilho,1996). As institutions for research, teaching and policy development, with their \ninfluence and resources, universities and colleges are well suited to take on the leadership for \npromoting sustainable development (Leal Filho et al. 1996, p. v). The potential of educational \ninstitutions for contributions within this area, is now being recognised by various quarters, \nsuch as the United Nations, the European Union, Government policies, agreements, and \nnumerous research reports. The Agenda 21, Chapter 36 (UNCED, 1992) recommends that:\n              \n            Governments should strive to update or prepare strategies aimed at integrating  \nenvironment and development as a crosscutting issue into education at all levels \nwithin the next three years. \n \nThe Greening of Higher Educational Institutions \u2013 What can it Achieve?  \nHE institutions can be described as \u2018microcosms\u2019 of environmental problems facing the larger \nsociety in numerous ways (Smith 1993, p.44). Hazardous chemicals used in laboratories, \n 6 \nfertilisers, insecticides, and pesticides are abundant on campuses, and can contribute to water \npollution and indoor air pollution problems that can put the campus community and natural \nsystems in danger (Smith 1993, p. xii). Chemicals depleting the ozone layer, causing \nincreased human, animal, and plant exposure to ultraviolet radiation, are common in cooling \nand refrigeration systems, automobiles, libraries, and fire extinguishers. Furthermore, \ntransportation to and from campus can lead to congestion, noise, and air quality problems for \nlocal communities (Creighton, 1999 p. 5). Universities and colleges also generate vast \namounts of radioactive, solid and hazardous wastes. Creighton (1999, p. 4) indicates that in \nNew England, US, alone, thirty-five universities or colleges are listed as contributors to \nhazardous waste sites for the failure of their contractors to dispose hazardous waste \nthoroughly. Indirect impacts are also created off campus by the production of goods and the \nuse of services, such as dioxin arising from paper bleaching, and pesticides used on food \nserved on campus. However, the largest environmental impacts caused by HE institutions, are \nprobably the carbon dioxide emissions and the air pollutants resulting from the burning of oil \nand natural gas to heat water and to cool and heat buildings (Creighton, 1999 p. 4).  \n \nBy implementing \u2018greening\u2019 actions on their campuses, however, HE institutions can reduce \nthe cumulative effect of these environmental problems, and thereby prevent environmental \ndegradation.  \n \nAs many of the people whose decisions will affect the future attend colleges and universities \ntoday, HE institutions have the potential of teaching environmental literacy to the politicians, \nteachers, and decision-makers of tomorrow (Eagan and Keniry 1998, p. 9). Both in the \nclassroom and by the example of its physical plant, a university can give students an \nunderstanding of the interrelationship between business decisions and the natural \nenvironment, and thereby model behaviours and attitudes that encourage environmental \nresponsibility (Creighton 1999, p. 6). A green university can furthermore become a green \nmodel for the external community by gathering and sharing effective ideas on environmental \nissues and practices.  \n \nThe greening of a college or university can also be cost effective. Eagan and Keniry (1998), \nshow that revenues and savings for 23 campus conservation projects in the USA came to more \nthan $ 16 million in just one year. The possibilities of saving costs on campus greening has \n 7 \nalso been exemplified by the \u201c50-50\u201d pilot project, now widely spread in Germany (Leal \nFilho 1999 p. 23).    \n \nIn a society with increased environmental awareness, a \u2018green attitude\u2019 can also give a HE \ninstitution a positive image to the outside world, and thereby be a selling point. Creighton \n(1999 p. 6) maintains that more than 20 percent of the students who enter the Tufts \nUniversity, USA, each year, lists its environmental \u2018label\u2019 as one of their three top concerns. \n \nHE institutions are \u201cintegral parts of the larger society\u2019s economic, social, and physical \nlandscape\u201d (Smith 1993, p. xii). Their economic power, through the investments they make, \nthe products they buy, and the companies they do business with, is extensive. By demanding \nenvironmentally friendly products and technologies, colleges and universities can therefore \ncreate or encourage markets for sustainable commodities. \n \nHow \u2018Green\u2019 are Today\u2019s Institutions of Higher Education? \nAs numerous differences exist between HE institutions, both within and between countries, \ngiving an exact and up-to-date overview of where HE institutions stand today with respect to \ngreening, is complex. However, a general summary can be established. Today\u2019s institutions of \nhigher education are slowly beginning to realise, and act upon, their \u2018sustainable development \nresponsibilities\u2019 (Khan 1996a, p.39). Several universities and colleges have started to \nimplement environmental concerns into their policies and day-to-day practices. In the UK, for \ninstance, 50 out of 132 institutions had an environmental policy in 1995, compared to only \none, in 1990 (Khan 1996a, p.39). Various international conferences, treating the role of \nuniversities in promoting sustainable development have also taken place. At such events, \ndeclarations, charters and action plans, outlining suggestions for how to \u2018green\u2019 a college or \nuniversity, have been established (Leal Filho 2000, p. 186).  \n \nHowever, although several HE institutions have started to implement prudent environmental \npractices, few are vigorously pursuing greening initiatives throughout their campus \noperations. Typically, particular efforts are carried out in one part of a university, while other \noperational units of the same institution will lag behind. Referring mainly to the USA, \nCreighton (1999 p. 7) claims that to date, few, if any college or university have undertaken a \ncomprehensive, across-the-board, environmental stewardship both within educational and \noperational areas. As for Europe and the UK, the situation seems to be quite similar. At some \n 8 \ninstitutions, efforts have started but faded away, and at others a greening process has yet to \nbegin (Leal Filho, 2000). There is, as the 1993 Toyne-Report establishes, \u2018yet much to be \ndone, and it needs to be done urgently\u2019 (Khan, 1996b).  \n \nGiven the clear benefits of \u2018going green\u2019, such as possibilities for saving money, \ndemonstrating new and clean technologies, and increasing student learning, why are so few \nuniversities and colleges active within this field? In other words, what are the barriers to the \ngreening of higher educational institutions?  \n \nEmpirical Studies on Barriers to the Greening of Higher Educational Institutions  \nEmpirical studies suggest various reasons for why HE institutions may be reluctant to actively \nimplement green actions. Creighton (1999), found the main barriers to greening at the Tufts \nUniversity, to be a fundamental lack of interest and commitment towards green initiatives \namong administrators, staff and students. Further barriers were established to be a lack of \nfinancial resources and environmental education within the campus community. Van Ginkel \n(1996) found the organisational structures and the predominating culture of the university to \nprevent the introduction of greening initiatives at the Utrecht University in the Netherlands. \nRiera (1996), determined the main barriers to implementing environmental policies at the \nUniversitat Autonomia de Barcelona, to be the lack of expertise, the lack of tradition, and as \nCreighton (1999) budgetary constraints. Meyerson and Massy (1995) established the most \nimportant barriers to greening to be long payback periods, and a general lack of incentives \nand information on environmental issues. Leal Filho (2000) found that misconceptions related \nto the topic \u2018sustainability\u2019 sometimes was used as an \u2018excuse\u2019 by HE institutions for not \nimplementing sustainable measures at their campuses. Leal Filho (1999 p. 22), further claims \nthat such misconceptions often are translated into a negative view, reflecting HE institutions\u2019 \nlack of willingness of implementing more sustainable actions.  \n \n \nMethodology \n \nThe research was carried out during July 2000. Data were collected through in-depth, in-\nperson, semi-structured interviews conducted at the following six institutions of higher \neducation in London, UK: \n \n 9 \n\u2022 Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine  \n\u2022 University of North London \n\u2022 University College London \n\u2022 University of East London \n\u2022 London School of Economics and Political Science \n\u2022 London Guildhall University \n \nThe interviews served both to obtain specific information concerning greening initiatives that \nhad been carried out at the sampled institutions, as well as individual judgements regarding \ndifficulties experienced, and ways to overcome these.  \n \nSemi-structured interviews were chosen because the interviewees were asked to elaborate on \nsubjects that perhaps could be perceived as delicate (such as problems experienced with \ncertain members of the campus community). Semi-structured interviews are characterised by \nmore or less open questions being brought to the interview situation in the form of an \ninterview guide (Flick 1998, p. 94). According to Kohli (1978), such interviews are more \nlikely to evoke the interviewees\u2019 viewpoints than is the case with standardised interviews and \nquestionnaires, which may restrict, rather than illuminate the interviewee\u2019s standpoint. It was \nhoped that with such an openly designed interview format, the interviewees would speak \nfreely. The specific class of semi-structured interview applied can be described as an \u2018expert-\ninterview\u2019; an interview form where the interviewee as a person is of less interest than is his \nor her ability of being an expert for a certain field of activity, in this case; energy and solid \nwaste management (Flick 1998, p. 92). As several interviewees preferred to be anonymous, \ntheir names are not listed. \n \nThe interview guide was divided into two parts: part one served to extract concrete \ninformation regarding greening initiatives that had been undertaken, while part two aimed to \nevoke the interviewees individual views on difficulties to greening and solutions for change, \nwithin energy and waste management. See Box 3.1 for interview guide. \n \n 10\nBox 3.1 The interview guide \n \nPart One: \n \nEnergy Management \n \n1. Which initiatives, if any, have been carried out to conserve energy and to increase energy \nefficiency at your campus? \n \n2. Have your campus undertaken any actions to raise campus awareness about the need for energy \nconservation? \n \n- If so, what has been done? \n \nSolid Waste Management \n \n3. Which initiatives, if any, have been carried out to reduce the volumes of solid waste at your \ncampus? \n \n4. Have your campus undertaken any actions to raise campus awareness about the need for waste \nreduction? \n \n- If so, what has been done? \n \nPart Two: \n \nBarriers to Greening \n \n5. What do you consider to be the most important barriers to the implementation of greening \ninitiatives within energy and waste management? \n \n6. How do you think such difficulties can be overcome? \n \n7. What should be the role of: \na) students \nb) staff \n 11\nc) academics \n \n- In overcoming such barriers and further \u2018green\u2019 your institution? \n \nThe interview sample constituted sixteen people chosen by criteria of whether they would \nhave the knowledge necessary to be able to answer and elaborate on the questions in the \ninterview guide. The interviewees were therefore people who dealt with environmental and \noperational activities on a daily basis, such as environmental managers and officers, energy \nmanagers, waste managers, estate officers, and health and safety officers. Four students, all \nmembers of environmental pressure groups, were also part of the interview sample. The \nstudents were included as they were likely to have some experience with trying to improve the \nenvironmental quality of their universities, and therefore hold opinions concerning difficulties \nto greening, and ways to overcome these.  \n \nQualitative data were analysed by coding and categorising the responses into major \nconceptual areas. An \u2018open coding\u2019 approach was applied, meaning that no pre-constructed \ncategories existed before the analyses took place (Birley and Moreland, 1998). Using a \n\u2018scissors and paste\u2019 method, statements were grouped by their contents to create larger \ncategories. E.g. various statements concerning difficulties with the implementation of \n\u2018greening\u2019 devices because of their expenses, were gathered together in a group named \n\u2018financial barrier\u2019, while statements treating the lack of interest among students and staff, \nwere placed in a \u2018cultural barrier\u2019 category.  \n \nThe number of interviewees \u2018giving rise\u2019 to the various categories was noted (such as sixteen \npeople mentioned the lack of financial resources to be a problem, while only five mentioned \nthe institutions\u2019 geographical location to be of importance). This was done with the aim of \nproviding simple frequency distributions to illustrate consensus or disagreements on topics, \nand to be able to establish which issues that were considered to be of greatest importance to \nthe interviewees. \n \nThere are various reasons for why the findings from this study should be interpreted with \ncare. The sample is rather small, and the collected data concerning greening initiatives that \nhad been carried out within energy and waste management at the various institutions, is based \nsolely on the information provided by the interviewees. It can be questioned whether the \n 12\nindividuals involved possessed the necessary \u2018expert\u2019 knowledge to include all relevant facts. \nThe data is further based on personal viewpoints, and is therefore subjective. As the majority \nof the interviewees were asked to criticise their own places of work, it also seems probable \nthat their responses to some extent were biased. Furthermore, as great differences exist \nbetween the various institutions (such as their number of students, campus size, subjects \ntaught, etc.), their experiences concerning greening within energy and waste management is \nlikely to differ, which may question the validity of an \u2018overall\u2019 evaluation.  \n \nHowever, because the interviewees3 occupied key positions within energy and waste \nmanagement it can be assumed that their responses largely were credible and well considered. \nIt is therefore hoped that the gathered data reflect the current \u2018greening\u2019 situation both in \nterms of attainments and difficulties experienced. Regarding further research, it could be of \ninterest to incorporate further members of a campus community in the interview sample (such \nas academics, administration, and more students), to examine whether their views would \nagree with the findings from this study. Research that evaluates barriers to greening within \nother areas (such as food, purchasing, transportation, and hazardous and radioactive waste) \nwould also be of great use.   \n \n \n \nResults and discussion \nHow green are the sampled institutions in the areas of solid waste and energy \nmanagement? \n \nThe first set of results to be presented, refers to the various greening initiatives that the \nsampled  institutions have carried out within solid waste and energy management. Figure 4.1 \nprovides an overview of the findings.  \n \nFigure 4.1 Greening initiatives carried out at the sampled institutions within solid waste and \nenergy management  \n \n                                                          \n3\n Apart from the four students involved. \n 13\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6\nRenewable energy sources\nFormal recycling program\nAluminium can recycling\nGlass recycling\nAwareness raising\nFluorescent lighting \nWater meters \nWaste-composition studies\nBuilding energy management systems \nRoom occupancy sensors \nEnvironmental policy \nBenchmarks with targets of reducing energy consumption \nEnergy manager \nLow flow water devices \nPaper and cardboard recycling\nNumber of institutions that have undertaken the initiatives\n \nSolid Waste Management \nThe results suggest that the sampled institutions have not reached particularly far in a \ngreening process within solid waste management. Although they were all recycling paper and \ncardboard, such initiatives were only carried out to a minor extent, typically they had boxes \nfor paper trash placed in lecture theatres and offices. It was mentioned by many that such \ninitiatives were not very successful, because people threw all kinds of rubbish in these boxes. \nTwo institutions had in fact implemented recycling programmes for glass bottles and \naluminium cans, but closed them down shortly after, as they did not work.  \n \nHowever, the fact that no efforts had been undertaken to inform people about how recycling \nworks, demonstrates the low priority that recycling is currently awarded. In other words, \nchange does not happen spontaneously, it takes time to readjust peoples\u2019 behaviour \n(Ackerman, 1997). Shutting down an important greening initiative simply because it has some \nproblems to begin with, does not reflect environmental stewardship in a time where the \namounts of solid waste generated by colleges and universities is on the rise (Smith 1993, p. 3). \nRecycling can further have a symbolic value, as it can be a visual sign of an institutions\u2019 \ncommitment to the environment (Eagan and Keniry 1998, p. 59).  \n \n 14\nNone of the institutions had undertaken efforts to reduce solid waste through composting4 or \nsource reduction5, and only fifty percent had undertaken waste composition studies to \ndetermine the main waste streams leaving their campus. Such studies are very important first \nsteps for waste management, after all; \u201cyou cannot manage what you have not measured\u201d \n(Forum for the Future, 1999a).  \n \nEnergy Management  \nThe sampled institutions are not at ground zero with respect to greening within energy \nmanagement. The fact that a majority had employed energy managers to supervise \nconservation and to improve the efficiency of their energy systems, reflects caution. Several \ninstitutions had also invested in building energy management systems (BEMS) to control and \nmonitor temperatures. Such systems can reduce energy use by up to twenty percent, and are \ntherefore successful devices towards a sustainable university (Creighton 1999 p.70). \nHowever, none of the institutions had installed energy saving devices throughout their \ncampuses, typically only a minority of the campus buildings contained such equipment. \nFurthermore, none of the institutions had incorporated equipment for safe and renewable \nenergy sources, like cogeneration6 and solar power. The extensive initial capital costs \nattended with implementing energy saving equipment, was emphasised by many as being a \ndecisive barrier for undertaking further greening initiatives within these areas (see the \ndiscussion of barriers further below). \n \n                                                          \n4\n Composting is a biological process that breaks down organic matter into material. Return of the compost to \nuniversity grounds can improve the soil structure, and reduce the need for fertilisers. Composting can help avoid \nadverse environmental impacts associated with landfilling and incineration. Waste that can be the subject of \ncomposting is organic matter such as food waste, paper napkins, leaves, grass clippings, and chipped brush \n(Creighton 1999, p. 62). \n5\n Source reduction implies reducing the amount of material discharged for eventual recycling or composting. \nSource reduction programmes typically eliminate single-use items, encourage reuse of materials, use materials \nthat are more durable and eliminate unnecessary usage such as junk mail (Keniry 1995, p. 150).  \n6\n Cogeneration produces high-temperature heat and generates electricity. It involves a process that maximises the \nefficiency of boiler systems and decreases off-site emissions generated by electric power plants. Such devices \ncan be of particular use for universities with large central boilers in colder climates ( Creighton 1999, p. 119) \n 15\nOnly one institution had tried to educate its campus community on how energy conservation \ncan reduce environmental impacts and financial costs. It appears as if individual involvement \nis not considered an effective measure in decreasing energy use. Although successful energy \nconservation probably takes more than stickers or notice boards telling people to turn off the \nlights, awareness-raising initiatives have in fact proved to be effective in reducing campus \nenergy use (Keniry 1995, p. 70).  \n \nIt seems like greening initiatives within energy and solid waste management is on the sideline \nof the sampled institutions\u2019 main priorities. Although various environmental initiatives had \nbeen undertaken, it was carried out rather occasionally, and not throughout the campuses. It \nappears that only greening initiatives where the financial payback are believed to be quick, are \nconsidered. Measures like renewable energy equipment, which significantly can reduce a HE \ninstitution\u2019s carbon dioxide emissions, have not been implemented by any of the sampled \ninstitutions. It further seems like those initiatives that require \u2018a little extra\u2019 effort, such as \nmaking recycling work despite initial problems, are not given much attention. Undertaking \ngreening actions simply because it is the \u2018right thing to do\u2019, as it can benefit the natural \nenvironment and teach and demonstrate environmental stewardship, did not seem to be a \ndriving force behind the initiatives that had been carried out, i.e. all measures appear to be \ncost related. \n \nWhat are the most important barriers to greening and how could they be overcome? \nThe second set of results to be presented, refers to which factors the interviewees considered \nto be of greatest importance in preventing a greening process from taking place within solid \nwaste and energy management. Coding and categorising the responses gathered from the \ninterviews into main conceptual areas, gave rise to the following categories: \n \n\u2022 Financial \u2013 the lack of financial resources \n\u2022 Awareness \u2013 the lack of environmental education  \n\u2022 Cultural \u2013 a non-environmental attitude prevailing at campus  \n\u2022 Urban \u2013 the lack of space for storing waste and constructing new, more energy efficient \nbuildings  \n \n 16\nFigure 4.2 provides an overview of the main barriers and the number of  individuals \nemphasising these to be of significance in preventing a greening process from taking place. \n \nFigure 4.2 Main barriers to greening within energy and solid waste management \n \n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16\nUrban \nCultural\nAwareness\nFinancial\nNumber of individuals considering the barriers to be significant\n \n \nThe Lack of Financial Resources \nThe results indicate that the main barrier to further greening within energy and waste \nmanagement is considered to be the great expenses connected with implementing energy \nsaving and waste reducing measures. It was generally asserted that as much as such initiatives \nwere preferred, they mainly had to remain a goal for the future. However, although greening \nactions can require up-front capital, several waste and energy reducing projects represent \nopportunities for colleges and universities to save vast amounts of costs.  \n \nParticularly within energy efficiency, there are possibilities for significant returns on a \nuniversity\u2019s investments. In regions where electricity is more expensive, installation of new \nenergy efficient technologies can have payback periods as short as months. The State \nUniversity of New York saves $9,000,000 annually due to a thorough implementation of \nenergy efficient retrofits and the promotion of energy conserving awareness in its campus \ncommunity. Although the initial capital investments were comprehensive ($17,000,000), these \nwere paid back in less than four years (Eagan and Keniry 1998, p. 20).  \n 17\n \nRenewable energy can also pay. Technologies within this area have now achieved efficiency \nlevels comparable to those of conventional fuels, and are cost-competitive for many \napplications (Keniry 1998, p. 59). Georgetown University annually saves $45,000 on \nphotovoltaic panels7 installed on its roof (Eagan and Keniry 1998, p. 28). Also in colder \nregions, solar power can be an efficient energy source, particularly for water heating where \nlarge volumes are used, such as in students\u2019 halls of residents. Creighton (1999, p. 119), \nasserts that solar power in fact can raise 40-degree water to a preheated temperature of 80 to \n90 degrees on a cold winter day. Although alternative energy may not be able to supply all the \npower needed for a HE institution\u2019s operations, it can still be a useful supplement in reducing \nthe amount of electricity that must be bought and thereby save costs (Creighton 1999, p. 120).  \n \nHowever, due to their long payback periods, renewable energy equipment is not widespread \namong HE institutions today, initiatives with short financial payback periods are mainly \npreferred. Keniry (1995, p. 65), warns against such practices, as it can make it difficult to ever \nfinancially justify measures that takes longer to pay for themselves. When quick payback \nprojects are completed, the savings from such initiatives are typically not made available to \nfinance longer payback measures, but are used for other, more immediate purposes. This can \nleave the longer payback projects stand alone because they never seem financially attractive \nenough to be addressed. However, considering the fact that most institutions of higher \neducation plan to be in business for long times, maybe well into the next century, investing in \nlong-term energy saving devices can be justified (Creighton, 1999 p. 6). Besides, the energy \nproduced thereafter is virtually free.  \n \nThe main argument used by the sampled institutions for not recycling was its lack of cost \nefficiency. It is correct that the market value of recycled material, particularly paper and \ncardboard, has declined during the past couple of years, resulting in revenue shortfalls (Keniry \n1998). However, with a little creative thinking, costs can still be saved. The University of \nWisconsin changed its recycling contractor and thereby saved the university  $70,000 \nannually. Its new contract established a floor price of zero dollars in the monthly transaction \nfor cardboard, newspaper and other lower grades of paper, which protected the university in \ntimes of extreme volatility in the market (Eagan and Keniry 1998, p. 64). The University of \n                                                          \n7\n Photovoltaic panels are systems that generate electricity from solar power. \n 18\nColorado has developed another way to cover the expenses of its recycling programme. The \nprogramme is primarily carried out on a voluntarily basis by students and it is funded by a \nsmall fee (\u00a3 1.50) assessed per student, in addition to revenues generated from materials sales \n(Eagan and Keniry 1998, p. 60).  \n \nAlthough costs can be saved on greening initiatives, a common problem is that universities \nonly have a finite amount of capital available for greening measures. This implies that \nalthough a project has rapid returns, there might not be resources available to cover its initial \nexpenses. However, by earmarking savings obtained from greening efforts to fund other \nenvironmental initiatives, such problems can be reduced, and at best; keep energy and waste \nmeasures self funded (Creighton 1999, p. 44). Another solution is for a university to use a \nshared saving plan.8 Such programs are particularly applicable for electrical efficiency \nprograms with quick financial payback. As equipment for energy saving and waste reducing \ninitiatives can be expensive, a cheaper solution for a university is to lease the equipment. \nGrants and gifts from private companies, governments, and foundations, can also be used to \ncover initial capital investments. The University of Illinois was assigned more than $600,000 \nin funding from its state to cover the costs of its recycling program (Creighton 1999, p. 45), \nand in Hamburg, Germany the City-State\u2019s HE institutions can apply for funds assigned by a \n\u2018green budget line\u2019 (Leal Filho, 1999). Furthermore, some electric utility companies offer \nrebates9 to subsidise the installation of energy efficiency measures. This constitutes \nopportunities for HE institutions to significantly reduce their costs (Creighton 1999, p. 43).  \n \nNumerous studies have designated the lack of financial resources as a significant barrier to \ngreening (for example Riera 1996, Meyerson and Massey 1995, and Creighton, 1999). After \nall, there is little or no doubt, that devices like BEMS\u2019 are expensive. Particularly regarding \ngreening measures with long-time payback periods can it be comprehensible that HE \n                                                          \n8\n A shared saving plan implies that the relevant environmental initiative is financed by a third party. The \nuniversity then pays the loan based on the calculated savings that result from the initiatives (Creighton 1999, p. \n43). \n9\n Rebates are cost-effective for power companies because the new technologies reduce the demand for \nelectricity, efficiently gaining capacity for additional electricity users in a way that is less expensive than by \nbuilding additional generating capacities (Creighton 1999, p. 43).  \n 19\ninstitutions may be reluctant. However, focusing on the sampled institutions, it can \nnevertheless be suggested that parts of this barrier may in fact be more due to a lack of \nknowledge, or as Leal Filho (1999 p. 23), puts it; \u2018a misconception, not based on facts\u2019, than \nactual budgetary constrains. It seemed like energy and waste reducing initiatives were \nprejudiced to be prohibitively expensive, although a minimum of investigation of possible \nalternatives had taken place. I.e. a lack of awareness regarding the financial benefits that \nprudent energy and waste management can involve, seemed to exist. \n \nThe lack of environmental awareness  \nThe lack of environmental awareness was considered significant because people do not know \nhow to act sustainable. In other words, investing in waste and energy reducing devices has no \nmeaning unless people know how and why it should be carried out. Decision-makers must be \nfamiliar with the benefits of greening to establish environmental policies and to invest in \ngreen devices, and academics must realise the necessity of being \u2018green\u2019 role models to their \nstudents. Furthermore, students must be made aware of how their habits and choices on \ncampus influences the institutions\u2019 own environmental \u2018footprint\u2019, before a change towards \nenvironmentally sustainable behaviour can be expected to take place. For encouragement, \npeople should also be informed of achievements, savings, and successes that have taken place \nin a greening process. The importance of raising environmental awareness at HE institutions \nis now being recognised from various bodies; The UK Sustainable Development Education \nPanel (1999, p. 13), notes that:  \n \nAll further and higher educational institutions should have staff fully trained  \nand competent in sustainable development, and should be providing all students  \nwith relevant sustainable development learning opportunities. \n \nNumerous ways of raising environmental awareness within a HE institution exist. An \ninstitution can therefore probably reach far in finding effective ways of awareness- raising by \napplying the human capital, i.e., the knowledge and skills that humans possess (Neumayer \n1999, p. 9) of its own campus. Behaviour analyses have shown that habits can be changed \nthrough public education (Creighton, 1999).  \n \nVarious forms of  \u2018visual\u2019 means (such as stickers, newspapers, etc.) and open lectures, can be \neffective ways of communicating environmental concerns. Such measures have proved \n 20\neffective at several HE institutions. The Liverpool John Moores University applies a website \nand a monthly newspaper to inform students and staff about environmental gains and areas \nthat need improvement (Forum for the Future, 1999b). A HE institution in Italy presents \nweekly seminars on environmental issues to its staff. The seminars are popular and have \ngenerated the creation of groups that meet and discuss ways of greening the institution (Leal \nFilho 2000, p. 189). In order to raise environmental awareness on waste management, the \nUniversity of Bath created a guidance booklet informing about its importance and the \nrequirements for legal compliance. It also provided guidance on disposal routs for waste \nmaterials and on waste classification (Forum for the Future, 1999a). \n \nAlthough there is little doubt that measures like open lectures and information in newspapers \nare effective means for raising awareness, it can be questioned whether such initiatives \nprovide the knowledge necessary for students to understand the complexity of environmental \nproblems and their solutions (Creighton 1999, p. 226). Cortese (1992) maintains that the best \nway to increase awareness enough to move in the direction of a sustainable development, is to \nintegrate environmental concerns into all relevant disciplines. Teaching environmental issues \nas part of courses can ensure that students pay attention and learn, as environmental issues are \n\u2018tied up\u2019 to subjects they have chosen to study. Cortese\u2019s ideas have been embraced by a \nnumber of HE institutions (Creighton 1999, p. 227). The University of Edinburgh has \nintegrated environmental perspectives into its courses (including those that do not have an \nenvironmental focus) by representing subjects using environmental examples, case studies \nhighlighting environmental concerns, and creating essay questions allowing students to \nexamine environmental implications (Forum for the Future, 1999c). \n \nSome of the interviewees suggested that students should be \u2018employed\u2019 as advocates for green \nissues. Such a \u2018bottom-up\u2019 approach might be effective as students probably feel freer to \ncriticise campus actions and decisions than academics and staff. As \u2018customers\u2019 at their HE \ninstitutions, students furthermore have a lot of power for demanding the accomplishment of \ngreening initiatives. Students acting as \u2018green\u2019 examples to their fellow students might also be \neffective, as the attitude comes from peers, and not just from staff, \u2018telling people what to do\u2019. \nAt the Yale University, a student environmental center with the aim of increasing student \nenvironmental awareness and leadership was established in 1992. The center was so \nsuccessful that it managed to raise funds, and organise the \u2018Campus Earth Summit\u2019 in 1995.  \n \n 21\nStudents can also be used as a resource by assisting staff in performing environmental actions. \nAt the University of Wisconsin-Madison, programs have been established where students \nwork together with academics and staff to reduce environmental impacts related to energy use \nand solid waste disposal (Heinz Family Foundation 1995, p. 24). Such initiatives can both be \ncost-effective, and teach students analytical problem solving skills that can be of use to \naddress ecological challenges they might face later in life (Smith 1993, p. ix). However, as \nstudents are busy with their studies, it might be difficult to find volunteers. A solution could \nbe to offer extra credits to students undertaking \u2018green\u2019 work at their campus.  \n \nHowever, as much as students\u2019 \u2018bottom-up\u2019 advocacy is necessary in raising awareness, a \n\u2018top-down\u2019 approach where the academics serve to promote environmental literacy, is \nbelieved to be an essential component for change. As the academics are the people who \nstudents look up to, they have a unique power to inspire students to follow their example. \nRelated to energy and waste management, academics can act as role models by turning off \nlights, printing double paged copies, allowing students to hand in papers electronically, and so \non.  \n \nSeveral authors have addressed the lack of environmental awareness within campus \ncommunities as an obstacle to greening (for example Riera 1996, Meyerson and Massey 1995, \nand Creighton 1999). The consensus is that people must be educated before a change can take \nplace. As for the sampled institutions, a double set of morals seems to exist. On the one hand, \nthey all considered the lack of awareness to prevent a greening process within energy and \nwaste management from taking place. On the other hand however, practically nothing had \nbeen done to raise environmental awareness. Furthermore, as numerous measures for how to \nraise awareness were suggested during the interviews, the topic appeared to be one that had \nbeen given some thought. By no means claiming that the importance of environmental \neducation was ignored by the institutions, it can however be suggested that a lack of \ncommitment and willingness to act, existed when it comes to teaching stakeholders the \nimportance of green behaviour. In other words, as much as the lack of environmental \nawareness is a barrier to greening, not undertaking any efforts to raise it, represents a barrier \nin itself.  \n \n 22\nCultural Barriers \nThe majority of interviewees considered the \u2018campus culture\u2019 to be another important barrier \nto undertaking energy and waste reducing measures. It was claimed that a general lack of \ninterest towards environmental improvements predominated their HE communities. Students \nand staff were described as careless, while the academics were considered uninterested and \ntoo busy with their own work to participate in a greening process. Of course, cultural and \nawareness barriers are inter-linked. Someone who is baised against or at least not interested in \nenvironmental issues will most likely also not be aware of many benefits of environmental \nimprovement measures. \n \nSeveral authors (for example Allen 1999, Van Ginkel 1996, Riera 1997, and Cortese 1999) \nhave determined campus culture as an obstacle to greening. Criticism is mainly levelled \nagainst faculty and administration, which are described as conventional and hard to change.  \n \nWhat then does it take to change campus culture into one of environmental stewardship? \nPeople need to change their everyday choices towards environmental alternatives. Because \nsuch choices involves repetitious rather than a single changes, they require a continuos need \nfor self-restraint, and might therefore be considered as one of the most challenging \ncomponents of campus greening (Creighton 1999, p. 273).  \n \nCollective action and commitment are also essential components for progress towards a \nchange in campus culture. Studies have proved the involvement of students and staff an \neffective mean in the self-greening of HE institutions (Higher Education Funding Council, \n1998). In other words, academics cannot be excluded from participating because they are busy \nwith research and lecturing, nor can students be excepted because of exams and course work. \nBecause all members of a campus community are part of creating the environmental impacts \nresulting from an institution\u2019s operations, they are all responsible for acting to reduce such \nimpacts.  \n \nHowever, the problem of \u2018campus culture\u2019 is in many ways closely related to the lack of \nenvironmental awareness. If people are to understand that their everyday personal choices and \ninstitutional actions can have long-term, detrimental environmental consequences, they have \nto be made aware of the importance of a healthy environment. After all, behavioural change, \n 23\nand thereby a change in culture, cannot be expected to take place unless people understand the \nbenefits and importance of doing so. \n \nUrban Location as a Barrier to Greening \nThe urban location of the sampled institutions was considered much less of a barrier than the \nother aspects discussed so far. Urban location can amount to a barrier to greening due to the \nrestricted space available for waste disposal and the lack of space for the construction of new \nand more energy efficient buildings. One interviewee claimed that as only one of their \nbuildings had a backyard for waste storage, the environmental impacts resulting from \ntransporting waste to this location would probably be more significant than those currently \nresulting from not recycling. A way to ease this problem could for example be for the \ninstitutions to reduce the number of parking places available to its students and staff, and \nthereby provide more space for recycling containers. The institutions could also seek co-\noperation with neighbours and their local communities for storage and transport of waste. \nRegarding the lack of space for the construction of new buildings, Creighton (1999, p. 8) \nasserts that the environmental impacts resulting from such construction probably exceed those \nof renovating already existing ones. Furthermore, several energy saving devices are cost \nefficient with short payback periods.  \n \nThe urban location was also suggested to be a reason for the lack of student environmental \ncommitment. It was claimed that students probably preferred spending their spare time on the \nnumerous recreational facilities that London offers than on campus, and therefore they did not \nhave the same attachment and responsibility towards their university as they perhaps would, if \nthey spent more time there. As one of the students put it: \u201cmy university is not a place where \nstudents spend their spare time, they go there for the lectures, that is all. As they do not feel \nconnected to the campus, nor do they feel responsible for the impacts resulting from it\u201d. \n \nThere is no question that a lack of space can complicate waste management, particularly \nrecycling, which requires relatively huge containers. Installing energy efficient devices in old \nbuildings constructed at a time when energy was inexpensive and resource conservation \nunknown, might also represent a difficulty. However, having an urban location cannot be \nconsidered a valuable excuse for not undertaking efforts to reduce some of the most \nsignificant environmental impacts resulting from a HE institution. As much as a successful \n 24\nimplementation of greening initiatives requires specific facilities and financial resources, it \nalso requires commitment, ingenuity, and a rethinking of priorities, to be successful.  \n \nHow can Barriers to Greening be Reduced or Overcome? \nThe third set of results to be presented, gives an overview of the diversity of suggestions, \nprovided by the interviewees, concerning ways to reduce, or possibly overcome barriers to \ngreening within solid waste and energy management. A common feature for the suggestions, \nwere their focus on initiatives for raising environmental awareness. Coding and categorising \nthe various responses gave rise to the following categories: \n \n\u2022 Open lectures \u2013 lectures on environmental issues open to all members of a campus \ncommunity \n\u2022 Visual means \u2013 \u2018eye catching\u2019 articles to disseminate environmental knowledge,  \nsuggested media were:  \n \n- Campus newspapers \n- The internet and e-mails  \n- Posters \n- Films \n- Students\u2019 handbooks \n- Leaflets \n- Stickers telling people to turn off the lights, close water taps etc. \n- Visible green recycling bins with informing text \n- Signs \n \n\u2022 Greening the curriculum \u2013  integrating environmental issues into all disciplines \n\u2022 Students as advocates \u2013 \u2018employing\u2019 students to promote the importance of greening  \n\u2022 \u2018Punishments and rewards\u2019-  punishing \u2018unsustainable\u2019 environmental behaviour with \nsuch as charges, and rewarding \u2018green\u2019 behaviour, for example with office equipment for \nstaff, and credits for students \n \nFigure 4.3 provides an overview of the suggested measures and the number of individuals \nattaching importance to these. \n 25\n \nFigure 4.3 Measures for how environmental awareness can be raised at campus \n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16\nPunishments and rewards\nStudents as advocates\nGreening the curriculum\nOpen lectures\nVisual means\nNumber of individuals considering the means to be effective\n \n \nConclusions \nThis study has attempted to perform an overall evaluation of how far a sample of higher \neducational institutions have reached with respect to greening within the areas of solid waste \nand energy management. The study has also determined what these institutions consider the \nmost important barriers to further greening, and suggested measures for how such barriers can \nbe reduced, or possibly overcome.  \n \nThe study found that although the sampled institutions were not at ground zero with respect to \ngreening, their overall environmental performance was relatively poor. Despite the fact that \nmeasures to improve energy and solid waste management had been carried out, such \ninitiatives were not implemented throughout the various campuses. It seems like only \ngreening initiatives that involve quick financial payback are prioritised. Renewable energy \nhad not been installed by any of the institutions, due to their long payback periods. The fact \nthat colleges and universities are institutions that normally stay in businesses for long periods \nof time, and therefore are in a position where long-term thinking can be financially beneficial, \ndid not seem to be a matter of consideration. Undertaking greening initiatives because it can \nbenefit the environment and teach and demonstrate environmental stewardship, did not appear \nto be a driving force. In other words all measured carried out were cost related. \n 26\nThe most important barriers to further greening were found to be: \n \n\u2022 Financial \u2013 the lack of financial resources \n\u2022 Awareness \u2013 the lack of environmental education  \n\u2022 Cultural \u2013 a non-environmental attitude prevailing at campus  \n\u2022 Urban \u2013 the lack of space for storing waste and constructing new, more energy efficient \nbuildings  \n \nThe lack of financial resources was considered the most significant barrier to greening. It was \nmaintained that although energy saving and recycling devices were preferred, they mainly had \nto remain \u2018a goal for the future\u2019 due to their costs. However, it can nevertheless be suggested \nthat parts of this barrier may in fact be more due to a lack of knowledge, or misconceptions, \nand an institutional reluctance to change, than actual budgetary constrains.  \n \nThe lack of environmental awareness was considered significant because people do not know \nhow to act sustainable. In other words, investing in waste and energy reducing devices has no \nmeaning unless people know how and why it should be carried out.  \n \nThe problem with \u2018campus culture\u2019 was described as the prevailing indifference towards \nenvironmental improvements. Students and staff were described as careless, while academics \nwere considered too busy with their own work to participate in a greening process.  \n \nThe urban location of the sampled institutions was described as a barrier because it implied \nrestricted space for waste disposal and for the construction of new and more energy efficient \nbuildings. However, adverse environmental impacts from the construction of new buildings \nmight actually exceed those of renovating already existing ones (Creighton 1999, p. 8).  An \nurban location is not an excuse for not undertaking efforts to reduce some of the most \nsignificant environmental impacts resulting from a HE institution.  \n \nIt is believed that the most important measures for reducing or overcoming the established \nbarriers to greening, is to raise environmental awareness within campus communities. I.e. \nsustainable behaviour cannot be expected to take place unless people understand the benefits \nand importance of doing so. Effective means for communicating environmental concerns can \nbe various forms of  \u2018visual\u2019 means and open lectures. However, greening the curriculum is \n 27\nbelieved to be more effective, as environmental issues are \u2018tied up\u2019 to subjects students have \nchosen to study. Collective action is further a measure of importance.. Because all members \nof a campus community are part of creating its environmental impacts, they are all responsible \nfor undertaking actions to reduce such impacts. Although the biggest opportunities for \ncreating environmental change within energy and waste management naturally fall in the \ndomain of operations departments and administrative offices, together, students, staff and \nacademics also have the potential to make an impact (Creighton, 1999).  \n \nHowever, to achieve a \u2018green\u2019 university that uses resources efficiently, creates little or no \nwaste, and takes full responsibility for any waste that it does generate, a fundamental change \nin the thinking behind routine decisions of university administration, staff, faculty and \nstudents is needed (Creighton, 1999). Although such a goal might seem overwhelming, \nuniversities may find that once a greening process is set in motion, it can be incremental, and \nsupport and reinforce further actions to take place. \n \nThe findings from this study are not believed to be characteristic for energy and waste \npractices only. As the barriers found mainly relate to \u2018unsustainable\u2019 human behaviour and on \ninstitutional reluctance to change, similar difficulties might probably rise with the \nimplementation of other greening initiatives that requires a change in peoples\u2019 everyday \nchoices10. Nor is it believed that the findings concern the sampled institutions solely. Rather, \nthey confirm what has been maintained by previous research; a general reluctance to greening \nseems to exist within the tertiary sector today. More needs to be done; so that colleges and \nuniversities will understand that greening has numerous advantages, and thereby start to \nvigorously pursue environmental initiatives at their campuses. As institutions for teaching and \nresearch, with their huge influence and resources, their sustainability efforts, both large and \nsmall, are likely to extend far beyond the institution\u2019s walls. \n \n \nReferences \nAckerman, F.
