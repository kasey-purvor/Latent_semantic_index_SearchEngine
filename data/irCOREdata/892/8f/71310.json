While this work adds considerably to our understanding\nof the changing role of the voluntary welfare sector, these accounts are largely aspatial.

Hence, we maintain, that\ngeographical approaches to voluntarism are important for social policy as such approaches\nargue that where events occur matter to both their form and outcome.\nIntroduction\nOver the last two decades it has been widely acknowledged that the \u2018post-war\nmodel of the corporatist welfare state is no longer sustainable, thus requiring\nnon-state actors to meet the burden of social welfare\u2019 (Amin et al., 1999: 3).\nInformed by neo-liberalism, successive Conservative Governments in the 1980s\nand 1990s moved towards market-based approaches to local welfare service\ndelivery, underpinned by the notion of the citizen\u2212consumer (Cochrane, 1998).\nLocal communities have been encouraged to take increased responsibility via\n\u2018active citizens\u2019 for the provision of services in tune with local needs (Taylor and\nBassi, 1998). Both these developments have relied increasingly on voluntary\nsector organisations. Since their election in 1997, the UK Labour Government\nhave continued this momentum as part of their programme of welfare reform.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\n74 christine milligan and nicholas r. fyfe\nIn a speech to the National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO) in\nJanuary 1999 the Prime Minister laid down the challenge to \u2018ignite a new spirit\nof involvement in the community\u2019 (Morris, 1999: 249). This has been reflected\nin the development of compacts between government and the voluntary sector\nacross England, Scotland and Wales \u2013 documents that specifically recognise the\ncomplementary roles played by government and the voluntary sector in the\ndevelopment and delivery of public policy and services; and that the government\nhas a role to play in promoting voluntary and community activity. This renewed\ninterest in civil society in the UK indicates that is a critically important time for\nthe development of the voluntary sector.\nCurrent interest in voluntary action is not simply a UK obsession \u2013 there are\nmuch wider ramifications for the development of civil society \u2013 echoed in the\nUnited Nations\u2019 proclamation of the year 2001 as being the International Year\nof Volunteers (Morris, 1999). In part, this is linked to welfare state restructuring\nbeing pursued by many of the world\u2019s advanced capitalist societies. In the USA, for\nexample, Peck (1998)points to the abandonment of a Fordist welfare state regime\nin favour of a post-Fordist workfare state that is associated with a localisation\nof responsibility for welfare in which voluntary, non-profit organisations are\nseen to play an increasingly important role (Twombly, 2001). The Third Way\nwelfare reform agenda in the UK places a similar emphasis on the importance of\ndeveloping a \u2018civil society\u2019 with voluntary associations as its organised vanguard\n(Giddens, 1998: 78). It is not just welfare reform, however, that has underpinned\nthe increased profile of voluntarism. Political concerns over the erosion of\ncitizenship and the need to encourage the development of social capital have\nfurther underscored the importance attached to voluntary activity in fostering a\nlocal sense of civic responsibility and engagement (Brown, 1997; Putnam, 2000).\nHence, this is an important time for those working within the field of social policy\nto re-examine voluntary activity, and in particular its role in welfare reform and\nthe implications for the equity of access to welfare services.\nThe growing political and social significance of the voluntary sector is\nreflected in a wide body of research that has emerged since the mid-1980s.\nWhile it is not the purpose of this paper to review these works (though see Fyfe\nand Milligan, 2003), notable areas of activity include: international comparisons\nof the voluntary sector (e.g. Ragin, 1998; Salamon et al., 2000); the changing\npolitical context of voluntary activity (e.g. Taylor and Bassi, 1998; Morison, 2000;\nMitchell, 2001); active citizenship and social capital (Putnam, 1993; Portes and\nLandholt, 1996; Boix and Posner, 1998); the professionalisation of the voluntary\nsector (Courtney, 1994; Gaston and Alexander, 2001; Gainer and Padyani, 2002;\nWyatt, 2002); and the nature of volunteering (Clary and Snyder, 1999; Wardell\net al., 2000; Reed and Selbee, 2000). While such work adds considerably to our\nunderstanding of the changing role of the voluntary sector in advanced capitalist\nsocieties, these accounts are largely aspatial. Yet, geographical perspectives can\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\ngeographical perspectives on voluntary activity 75\noffer unique insights into the development of the voluntary sector at both micro-\nand macro-levels that are of particular relevance to those working in the field of\nsocial policy. In a climate of welfare reform underpinned, in part, by an increased\nreliance on voluntary and community activity, understanding the complex webs\nof interaction that act to facilitate or constrain the development and coverage of\nvoluntary organisations across space and within places is of critical importance\nin ensuring equitable access to welfare. It is this specific aspect of voluntary sector\ndevelopment that we address within this paper.\nWe do this in two ways: firstly, the paper briefly outlines some of the ways in\nwhich geographers have contributed to a wider understanding of voluntary sector\ndevelopment in the UK and other advanced capitalist states. Secondly, building\non these established interests amongst human geographers in voluntarism, we\ndraw on material from our own recently completed research in the Scottish city\nof Glasgow, to illustrate how a greater understanding of place can provide unique\ninsights into the development of voluntary welfare activity across space.\nLocating voluntarism: geographical perspectives\nGeographical work on the voluntary sector focuses on three key themes:\nspace, place and political context. In relation to the spatial distribution of\nvoluntary activity, several researchers have highlighted the uneven distribution\nof organisations and the existence of voluntary sector \u2018rich\u2019 and voluntary sector\n\u2018poor\u2019 areas of cities (see Wolpert, 1977; Wolch and Geiger, 1983; Wolch, 1989\nand 1990). More recently Fyfe (1995) and Milligan (1998) have highlighted\nneighbourhood and regional variations in UK voluntary activity in the fields\nof crime prevention and social care respectively. Not only does this uneven\nspatial distribution of voluntary activity mean uneven access to services but also\ndifferences in the opportunities for participation and involvement in voluntary\ngroup activities. Explanations for these patterns have focused partly on differences\nin local cultures and the historical development of philanthropy within particular\nplaces over time (Bryson et al., 2002). Also important, however, are changes in\npolicy and funding structures at both local and national government levels.\nIn particular, spatially targeted programmes can lead to the development of\nvoluntary activity in ways that are both piecemeal and sporadic, owing as much\nto the availability of resources in some areas as they do to any planned action\nbased on identified need (Milligan, 2001).\nA second area of geographical interest concerns the links between voluntary\norganisations and the places in which they are active, revealing how voluntary\nsector development can be affected by, and affect, the characteristics of particular\nplaces. Brown\u2019s (1997) work on Aids activism in Vancouver, for example, revealed\nhow voluntary sector development was connected to local, place-based needs,\nleading to the agglomeration of Aids voluntary groups in particular parts of\nthe city and contributing to the emergence of so-called \u2018service dependent\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\n76 christine milligan and nicholas r. fyfe\nghettos\u2019 within cities (Dear and Wolch, 1987). As Milligan\u2019s (1996) work on\nvoluntarism and mental health further illustrated, the presence of the voluntary\nsector provision in an area can impact on the movement and distribution of\nservice recipients in both positive and negative ways. This type of geographical\nwork draws attention to the need for greater awareness amongst policy-makers\nof the wider impact of local voluntary sector development on service users\nand how such development can act to re-shape the characteristics of particular\nplaces. The nature of places is also important to understanding differences in\nlevels of volunteering. Higher levels of volunteering are generally associated\nwith rural rather than urban areas and with more affluent rather than deprived\ncommunities (see Wardell et al., 2000; Prime et al., 2002). However, there\nis also some evidence of a growth in voluntary participation amongst the\nunemployed living in economically depressed localities as they seek to recreate\npositive working lives for themselves through voluntary work (e.g. Macdonald,\n1996).\nThe third strand of geographical work on voluntarism focuses on the\npolitical context of voluntary activity. The most influential work, here, is by\nWolch (1989, 1990) who coined the term \u2018shadow state\u2019 apparatus to describe\nvoluntary organisations charged with major welfare service responsibilities (often\npreviously shouldered by the public sector) but which remain within the arena of\nstate control because of funding and regulatory regimes. Wolch draws particular\nattention to the political tensions that exist within the shadow state apparatus.\nWhile on the one hand the involvement of the voluntary sector in a mixed\neconomy of welfare provision may help democratise the delivery of welfare\nservices, on the other the increasing dependence of these organisations on state\ncontracts and grants may simply reinforce state control over welfare provision.\nThese are issues that also emerge from more recent geographical research on\nthe UK social economy (Amin et al., 1999). While the development of the\nsocial economy (which includes voluntary organisations) might be interpreted\nas contributing to the empowerment of local communities by mobilising\nactive citizens and taking power away from local authorities, few voluntary\norganisations can flourish without public money which imposes constraints\non how they operate. For Hasson and Ley (1994), this highlights the importance\nof understanding not just how political activity in relation to voluntarism is being\nplayed out in society, but where. Focusing on welfare voluntarism in both Canada\nand Israel, they maintain that while on the one hand renewed interest in civil\nsociety in these states indicates a revival of urban politics and apparent decentring\nof power, on the other there is an increasing absorption of some voluntary\norganisations within the institutional-political system and the emergence of\nco-production or partnership working. This is manifest in the emergence of\nnew, hybridised forms of politics that are emerging in actual locations where the\nstate and civil society overlap. Understanding these changes in political culture\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\ngeographical perspectives on voluntary activity 77\nand structure are crucial if we are to enable successful citizenship to develop\nwithin and across these newly emerging spaces of civil society.\nTaken together these studies of the links between voluntarism, space,\nplace and political context clearly demonstrate the unique insights offered\nby geographical perspectives on the role and development of voluntary\norganisations. Yet this research still only offers a partial and fragmented picture\nof the voluntary sector. In particular, most of these studies focus on space, place\nor political context rather than the inter-relationships between these different\nelements (though see Milligan, 2001); and most studies (with the exception of\nWolch, 1990) focus on voluntary organisations linked to just one area of social\npolicy. What is missing is an understanding of the interplay between space, place\nand political context for making sense of the development and distribution of\na range of voluntary activity in a particular area. It is this particular aspect of\nvoluntarism that we address in the second part of this paper.\nThe character of the voluntary sector, however, is extremely complex,\ncomprising a myriad of organisational structures, activities and motivations.\nThus, we begin by briefly outlining how we define the voluntary sector for the\npurposes of our work.\nThe voluntary sector concept\nThe 1601 Charity Law indicates that philanthropy and charitable institutions\nhave played a role in UK welfare for at least four centuries (Taylor, 1992). Terms\nsuch as voluntarism and voluntary organisation, however, are relatively modern\nand tend to be used without precise definition, which can, as a result, confuse\nmaterially different activities. This reflects the traditionally atheoretical nature\nof the study of voluntarism and its inception within pragmatic policy-making\nrather than as an academic discipline. The problems associated with attempts to\ndefine the voluntary sector have been highlighted by numerous commentators\n(see, for example, Hedley and Smith, 1992; Giner and Sarasa, 1996; and Anheir\nand Salamon, 1999). Such difficulties are compounded by the diversity of roles and\nactivities undertaken by voluntary organisations \u2013 ranging from lobbying and\npressure groups; mutual support and advocacy; leisure and cultural activities to\ndirect welfare service provision. In many instances organisations are involved in\none or more of these activities, highlighting the convoluted nature of the sector,\nleading Kendall and Knapp (1995) to conclude, rather aptly, that the voluntary\nsector resembles something of a \u2018a loose and baggy monster\u2019. However, while\nacknowledging its diversity, it is necessary to have a working definition, thus, for\nthe purposes of our study we followed Taylor (1992: 171) in defining the voluntary\nsector as comprising:\nSelf-governing associations of people who have joined together to take action for public benefit.\nThey are not created by statute, or established for financial gain. They are founded on voluntary\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\n78 christine milligan and nicholas r. fyfe\neffort, but may employ paid staff and may have income from statutory sources. Some, by no\nmeans all, are charities. They address a wide range of issues through direct service, advocacy,\nself-help and mutual aid and campaigning.\nThis definition was adopted as it is closely aligned to that used by the Scottish\nCouncil for Voluntary Organisations (1997) in Scotland, and that used by the\nGlasgow Local Authority (Glasgow City Council, 1997). It was thus deemed\nappropriate for research conducted in one of Scotland\u2019s major cities. Though not\ndirectly addressed within this paper, it is also a definition that accords with that\nused by Wolch (1990) in her analysis of the voluntary sector as a \u2018shadow state\u2019 \u2013\nthe conceptual underpinning for this study.\nVoluntary organisations, social welfare and the city\nThe wider study upon which this paper draws was undertaken in Glasgow, one\nof the most densely populated cities in Scotland. Glasgow is also a city whose\npopulation experiences some of the highest rates of poverty and deprivation in\nthe UK (Glasgow Alliance Social Inclusion Inquiry, 1998) and, as such, it faces\nhuge challenges in delivering social welfare. In recent years, it has also been\nsubject to significant political upheaval and financial difficulties (Sinclair, 1997)\ndue, in large part, to the political re-organisation of local government under the\n1996 Local Authorities (Scotland) Act. The presence of an active voluntary sector,\nthus, has a significant role to play in supporting the social welfare needs of its\npopulation.\nConstructing Glasgow\u2019s voluntary sector profile\nConstructing a local profile of the voluntary sector can be fraught with\ndifficulties because of problems of definition and dynamism. Not only are there\ndifficulties defining voluntary organisations (see above), but the dynamism of\nthe sector in terms of \u2018birth\u2019 and \u2018death\u2019 rates means databases quickly become\nout of date. For the purposes of this study, however, we drew on a set of\noverlapping and regularly updated databases held by the city\u2019s main public\nlibrary, the Glasgow Council for the Voluntary Sector and the Glasgow Healthy\nCities Partnership, together with other publicly available data. This yielded 2,585\nvoluntary organisations concerned with the delivery of social welfare across the\ncity. These organisations were classified by category using the Local Voluntary\nAction Survey (LOVAS) schema.1 Table 1 provides an overview of their main areas\nof activity.\nThe data on these voluntary organisations were mapped using Geographical\nInformation Systems (GIS) software, together with a range of socio-economic\ndata, as a means of stimulating further investigation about the possible\nrelationships between place, voluntary organisations and social need. Following\nthe mapping process, the study focused on three key areas of social welfare:\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\ngeographical perspectives on voluntary activity 79\nTABLE 1. Organisational focus of welfare voluntary organisations in Glasgow.\nOrganisational focus No. of organisations % of total\nHealth 426 16.5\nYouth 460 17.8\nHousing\/neighbourhood 326 12.6\nDisability 287 11.1\nElderly 276 10.7\nCrime 41 1.6\nPoverty 161 6.2\nEthnicity 148 5.7\nOther support organisations 253 9.8\n(e.g. carers groups)\nOther welfare organisations 207 8.0\nhealth, ethnicity and crime and criminal justice. Questionnaires were sent to all\nknown voluntary organisations within these three sectors in order to gain more\ndetailed information about organisations, the services they deliver, where and\nhow they engage with local communities and with local and national government.\nFinally, we undertook a series of in-depth interviews with key informants from\nvoluntary organisations within each of these sectors that operate at local, regional\nand national levels and with officials within local (Glasgow City Council) and\nnational (Scottish Executive) government. The aim, here, was to gain a more\nnuanced understanding of those inter-relationships that operate between local\ncommunities, the voluntary sector and the state.\nMaking sense of the voluntary sector map\nBuilding on earlier geographical work the study sought to examine the\nrelationships between voluntary sector activity and place. Although previous\nresearch has linked the distribution of organisations to the economic prosperity\nof communities, and particularly to a working middle-class that is seen to form\nthe core of voluntary labour (Wolpert, 1977; Wolch, 1989, 1990), in Glasgow this\nrelationship is far less clear-cut. Indeed, there is clear evidence that voluntarism\nis thriving in some relatively deprived areas of the city, suggesting the need for a\nmuch more nuanced understanding of how the relationship between voluntarism\nand place is played out across the city.\nOf course, mapping the voluntary sector in this way, while a useful starting\npoint for informing policy and practice, has its limitations. The picture of\nvoluntary sector activity is only partial in that it focuses explicitly on the\ngeographical location of the organisation itself, rather than its area of benefit.\nThe agglomeration of voluntary sector activity within Glasgow\u2019s urban core,\nfor example, to some extent, reflects the operational scale of the organisation\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\n80 christine milligan and nicholas r. fyfe\n(i.e. whether city-wide or regional). Nevertheless, outside the urban core,\nvoluntary organisations do tend to operate within limited geographical\nboundaries, and, as this section will reveal, locational decisions at the micro-\nscale are considerably more complex than a simple reflection of operational\nscale.\nThe spatial organisation of voluntarism in the city is affected by a complex\nrange of influences operating at both micro-and macro-scale that bare little\nrelation to the affluence of a particular locale. At the micro-scale, for example,\norganisations revealed that siting strategies were linked not just to the identi-\nfication of need, but also to the allocation of space as a \u2018free resource\u2019 or at a\nreduced rent, or the need to rationalise services and reduce overheads. However,\nlocation and the expansion of voluntary services in particular places can also\nbe constrained by a lack of available premises within key areas of need. As one\nrespondent explained in relation to one of Glasgow\u2019s more deprived communities,\n\u2018Office space and community facilities are a big problem in the Gorbals . . . At\nthe moment there is limited space and that\u2019s now starting to impact on service\ndelivery from the voluntary sector in the area . . . there\u2019s not that many voluntary\nsector community groups left in the Gorbals.\u2019\nThe map of voluntary activity in the city is also shaped, in part, by specific\nproblems of accessibility experienced by the client group that the organisation\nwas set up to serve. Organisations highlighted the need to be located within a\nshort walking distance of key public transport routes if voluntary services are to\nbe fully utilised. Yet, as disability organisations also pointed out, the inability of\ntheir client group to access services and support in the city centre due to poor\ndisabled access, obliged them to relocate to the urban periphery where physical\naccess is easier, if more geographically distant. Others pointed to the need to\nlocate in places that their client group could safely access. \u2018Turf-territoriality\u2019 in\nperipheral areas of Glasgow, for example, creates a self-imposed spatial exclusion\nfor ex-offenders wishing to access support services. As one co-ordinator noted,\n\u2018Oh yes, our job couldn\u2019t be anywhere else but the city centre \u2013 we have difficulties\nwith gangs that can\u2019t enter into other parts of Glasgow where there would be some\ngang rivalry. So its easier for them to come here and stay anonymous.\u2019 The city\ncentre, in this instance, provided a \u2018neutral zone\u2019 that clients from across the city\ncould safely access. At the micro-level, the co-ordinator further emphasised the\nimportance of finding appropriate office space in the city, noting, \u2018We used to\nbe based in quite posh offices that we had to share with one of the Christian\ngroups . . . But they [service users] found that quite difficult because guys were\nhaving to come up the same stairs and emblazoned on the wall, was, you know,\n\u201cHe who sins shall die in hell\u201d \u2013 it was quite disturbing to some of our guys,\nespecially if they had mental health difficulties . . . . So I found this place \u2013 I\nwanted it to be \u201cnormal\u201d for my clients, so they would not feel any more\nstigmatised than what they already were . . . .\u2019\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\ngeographical perspectives on voluntary activity 81\nUrban policy and voluntary landscapes of exclusion\nWhile locational decisions can, in part, be defined by practical and pragmatic\nconcerns associated with access and the availability of low cost premises close\nto an identified need, they are also influenced by the wider policy environment\nwithin which voluntary organisations operate. Indeed, given that over half the\norganisations in our survey received their main funding from either central\ngovernment (normally the Scottish Executive) or local government (Glasgow\nCity Council), any change in social policy will have a significant impact on\nthe voluntary landscape in the city. The long history of spatially targeted\nurban regeneration programmes in Glasgow has been of particular importance.\nUnder the urban programme, local authorities could put forward projects\nto be run by voluntary organisations and community groups in Areas of\nPriority Treatment (APTs). Given the territorial extent of severe deprivation\nin Glasgow, many areas were eligible for Urban Aid, though not all areas\nchose to bid for these funds to support voluntary activity. Indeed, as our\nwork revealed, there was an significant interplay between the structural context\nprovided by central state funding opportunities, and the importance of human\nagency in the form of the bids put forward for Urban Aid by the local\ncouncil\u2019s area co-ordinators in different parts of the city. As a local authority\nofficial explained, \u2018Drumchapel did very well out of the Urban Programme\nmainly because the Area Co-ordinator for the Dumchapel area was zealous\nin applying for Urban Aid while the then Area co-ordinator for Easterhouse\nwasn\u2019t.\u2019\nIn the mid-1990s, urban programme restructuring moved away from APTs\ntowards Priority Partnership Areas (PPAs). The criteria for PPA status varied\nfrom that of APTs and as a consequence some voluntary organisations found\nthemselves in geographically defined areas that were now excluded from this\nsource of income. The most recent form of spatially targeted funding centers\non Social Inclusion Partnership areas (SIPs)2 as part of the Scottish Executive\u2019s\nbroader social inclusion strategy. Each SIP area has funding available for voluntary\norganisations to deliver services that contribute to the social inclusion agenda.\nThe result has been to create what one local observer referred to as a \u2018feeding\nfrenzy\u2019 for funding amongst voluntary organisations as they target SIP areas\nas places for further service development. Given that SIPs overlap extensively\nwith previous territorial programmes, the effect has been to reinforce existing\npatterns of unevenness in the development of voluntarism across the city, a\npattern exacerbated by its agglomerative effect on other key funding bodies.\nUrban Aid and changes from APTs to PPAs and the current SIP status have all\nhad differing, but geographically defined, eligibility criteria attached to voluntary\nsector funding opportunities. Each of these programmes has laid down layers of\nstate funding potential for voluntary organisations in different parts of the city\nfor limited periods of time. The net effect has been to create a dynamic mosaic of\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\n82 christine milligan and nicholas r. fyfe\nopportunities for voluntary organisations to develop services in geographically\ndefined communities.\nWhile the skewing of funding opportunities is targeted at areas of greatest\nneed, it also raises a number of problems. Area-based funding programmes create\ncomplex patterns of inclusion and exclusion. The strong element of localism in\nthe SIP programme, where individual SIP boards set their own priorities, means\nthat some groups find it difficult to establish a presence in particular places,\nan issue that has been raised particularly by organisations serving the needs of\n\u2018unpopular\u2019 client groups (e.g. mental health and domestic violence). As the co-\nordinator of a mental health organisation explained: \u2018the SIP thing is a particular\nproblem because we cannot get mental health on the social inclusion agenda\u2019. The\ninability to access such an important source of funding clearly has an impact on\nhow specific sub-sectors develop across the city. Further, as Turok and Hopkins\n(1998) caution, those areas that do not receive funding through territorially\nbased funding programmes may be doubly penalised because the skewing of\nfinancial resources towards successful areas may mean a progressive diversion\nof resources from losers, while the \u2018winner takes all\u2019 as a result of complex co-\nfunding arrangements. As one respondent put it: \u2018Some communities that were\njust out [side] of these SIP areas felt they were being excluded . . . and they felt\nthey had the same deprivation . . . And that\u2019s caused quite a bit of aggro, because\nit means not only do SIP monies concentrate in these areas, but it means that\nother agencies in the city think, \u201coh well, maybe we should concentrate on those\nSIP areas\u201d \u2013 so they lever in more money to these areas whereas those outside\nfelt . . . more deprived than they were previously.\u2019\nConnecting with communities\n\u2018[A]ll local agencies need a sophisticated understanding of the nature of the\ncommunities they serve . . . It is essential that each organisation also works closely\nwith their own stakeholders and service users. This should again help to build\na wider community ownership of all aspects of community cohesion\u2019 (Home\nOffice, 2002: 14\u201316).\nRenewed emphasis on the promotion of active communities to meet the\nGovernment\u2019s community cohesion programme places an increased emphasis on\nvoluntary sector participation. Indeed, a key objective of the UK Government\u2019s\nActive Communities Unit is to encourage people to become actively involved in\ntheir communities through the development of the voluntary and community\nsector. For such an objective to be achieved, it is critical to understand:\n(a) how voluntary organisations engage with communities in particular places;\nand (b) how the development of the voluntary sector within places impacts on\nthis engagement.\nVoluntary management committees play an important role in connecting\nthe organisation to local people and keeping in touch with local views and needs.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\ngeographical perspectives on voluntary activity 83\nAs one local organiser put it, \u2018the management committee are all local people,\nso you can say it\u2019s the community that are managing the project and giving it\ndirection as well, through their involvement\u2019. Hence, while organisations note\nthe importance of co-opting strategically placed individuals who can support or\nadvance the organisational cause at the level of local or national government,\nthere is a clear recognition that management committees also need to reflect\nthe communities they are serving. In Glasgow, many local community members\nserving on management committees also serve on other voluntary committees\nor local fora. This is seen as serving a three-fold function: firstly, as a means of\nnetworking with other organisations and their strategically co-opted committee\nmembers; secondly, as a conduit to the local community \u2013 advertising their local\npresence and services provided; and, thirdly, as a means of increasing their own\nawareness of other organisations within the local community, services offered and\npotential unmet need. The dynamic nature of the voluntary sector reinforces the\nimportance of this function, for as one organiser put it, \u2018a lot of organisations and\nprojects start up and go away and its really difficult to keep track of what\u2019s there\u2019.\nThe extent to which organisations successfully engage with the local\ncommunity is also, to some extent, influenced by organisational size and the\ngrowing drive towards professionalisation. The increasingly complex services\nprovided by the voluntary sector, combined with the need to meet those\nrequirements laid down by the state as part of its monitoring process, makes such\nchange an inevitable part of the growth process. In Glasgow, this was illustrated\nby the experience of a crime and criminal justice organisation that developed,\norganically, as an assortment of locally based autonomous organisations. Growth,\nheightened public expectations and the drive to deliver a professional and\nequitable service across Scotland led to organisational restructuring resulting\nin a hierarchical structure in which one single Glasgow-based organisation is\nnow responsible to the national body. Concomitant with this has been the\ndevelopment of a corporate structure with unified policy and decision-making\nand a loss of local autonomy. As one member of the organisation explained,\n\u2018we had to become more one organisation than lots of wee organisations \u2013 now\nwe are all practising the same, whereas before, if you took something to your\nlocal management committee, you could get them to pass something locally and\nyou had their support and backing. Now you have to adhere to the guidelines,\nregulations and everybody is doing the same. They\u2019ve got standardisation, its\nbecoming more professional.\u2019\nWhile the increased harmonisation of service delivery and standards is de-\nsigned to improve the quality of services delivered to service users, re-organisation\nhas not been without its casualties. Restructuring has resulted in the loss of local\nmanagement committees raising anxieties amongst local volunteers over the\ndistancing of support and concerns that the organisation\u2019s flexibility and its\nability to make decisions quickly \u2013 the traditional strengths of the voluntary\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\n84 christine milligan and nicholas r. fyfe\nsector \u2013 are being eroded as a consequence. As one respondent put it, \u2018we don\u2019t\nget as much support as we used to . . . I know my colleagues have issues with it\nbecause they could contact a member of the committee to gain support \u2013 and\nif they had a problem, they got an answer. Now, they have to take it to our co-\nordinator who has to take it to our area committee, who then has to sit down and\ndiscuss it and then bring it back. The decision-making structures are becoming\nmore bureaucratic and distant.\u2019\nRe-organisation has also caused some volunteers to feel they have been\n\u2018pushed out\u2019 of the organisation, and concerns have been voiced that the drive\nfor professionalisation is causing a loss of local identity as the local community\nstructure becomes a non-autonomous part of the bigger organisation. As the co-\nordinator commented, \u2018we have to be careful that we don\u2019t lose the whole focus of\nthe service which is on volunteers working for people in the community who are\nhurting for one reason or another. We want to be professional, but we still want to\nkeep this user-friendly.\u2019 This problem has been widely recognised by respondents\nwithin our study who note that, while it is clearly important to provide a good\nquality service, there is also a requirement to remain aware to the needs of local\nvolunteers. One of the difficulties organisations face in restructuring is that it can\nhave the effect of reducing the continuity of contact, both with the organisation\nitself and the service user. Both these aspects of voluntary participation, however,\nare seen as crucial to the continued and positive engagement of local volunteers\nwith the organisation.\nEngaging with volunteers and the local community in the delivery of\nincreasingly complex welfare services, thus, places voluntary organisations in\na dilemma. While on the one hand the needs being serviced by the voluntary\nsector require a professionalisation of the organisation in order to maximise its\neffectiveness, on the other organisations also need to be able to relate to the\nexperience that is common to that community, ensuring that the community\nhas some sense of ownership of the organisation whose role is to respond to\ntheir needs. In the words of one respondent, \u2018reaching out, being there, hanging\nout, really listening \u2013 connecting and trying to generate a shared sense of what\nneeds to be done is a key thing\u2019. Such sentiments emphasise the importance of\nbeing locally accessible and knowing the community in which organisations are\nactive.\nWhile the drive for professionalisation and the impact of growth on those\nvoluntary organisations serving a national agenda can act to reduce their ability to\nmaintain a local identity, it would be wrong to assume that all organisations serve\nthis same agenda. Some are territorially designed to meet the very specific needs\nof particular communities. In Glasgow, this was particularly true of black and\nethnic minority organisations as illustrated by one organisation set up to serve\nthe elderly Chinese community. Early Chinese migrant workers resided almost\nexclusively in the Garnethill area of Glasgow, and, while the working population\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\ngeographical perspectives on voluntary activity 85\nis now more widely dispersed across the city, Garnethill still forms the heart of the\nChinese community. As the co-ordinator of the organisation noted, the Chinese\npopulation still tends to migrate to Garnethill on retirement, where they know\nthey will gain from culturally responsive community support. The organisation\nhas thus been developed to meet a need that is both culturally and territorially\nspecific. Location is clearly important, not only in terms of accessibility for its\nservice users, but also in terms of its role in maintaining Chinese identity within\nGlasgow.\nBecause this organisation has been designed to meet the needs of a culturally\nspecific community, the way in which the organisation seeks to engage with the\nlocal community also needs to reflect the Chinese culture. Decision-making\noccurs in a very non-hierarchical and informal way in order to maximise\nparticipation. As the co-ordinator put it: \u2018we run in a democratic way. All their\n[volunteers\u2019] suggestions, all their comments are welcome, because they also have\na lot to contribute . . . you have to do that in such an informal way because I would\nsay the culture in the Chinese community, they don\u2019t like things to be too formal,\nbecause sometimes the formality will drive them away.\u2019\nWhilst the hierarchically and locally independent organisational structures\nrepresent the two extremes on a spectrum, some organisations operate within\na \u2018federal\u2019 structure. Here local organisations affiliate within an overarching\nstructure in which each organisation is locally autonomous, but has the use of\nthe \u2018brand name\u2019. In this way, organisations are able to benefit from the support of\nthe national office and the national profile of the organisation on the proviso that\nit agrees to operate within the overarching ethos and philosophy of the national\norganisation. This facilitates the maintenance of local community relationships.\nAs a national representative of one federally structured health organisation noted,\n\u2018each one is an independent charity . . . they have a local management committee\nand they are volunteers, so its very much local motivation that makes a scheme\nwork\u2019. However, as this same respondent also noted, where local motivation is\nabsent it can result in geographically uneven service development. As she explains,\n\u2018we don\u2019t develop quite as fast as people expect . . . we don\u2019t say there\u2019s these blank\nareas where we\u2019ll develop schemes. Its not a case of us going along with a pool of\nmoney and building up an service . . . sometimes you simply cannot et the thing\noff the ground \u2013 that can be a bit of a frustration.\u2019 Further development of an\norganisation she notes \u2018doesn\u2019t necessarily relate to the population in need, it\nrelates more to the finances of the [individual] scheme\u2019.\nSo, in part, the extent to which voluntary organisations engage with the\nlocal community is linked to the fact that some organisations are territorially\ndesigned to meet the needs of particular communities but is also due, in part,\nto their organisational structure. The extent to which locally based organisations\nhave autonomy over the development and delivery of their services, for example,\nis dependent on whether an organisation serves a local, regional or national\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\n86 christine milligan and nicholas r. fyfe\nagenda and the extent to which its structure is locally autonomous, federal or\nhierarchically structured. Local connections between voluntary organisations\nand the community are thus seen to operate on a continuum between\nlocal and national, based on their bureaucratic and organisational structure.\nThe spatial remit and organisational structure of a voluntary organisation\nthus has clear implications for the extent to which it is able to form local\nattachments, and hence the development of the voluntary landscape across the\ncity.\nA changing political geography of voluntarism\nOf critical importance in understanding voluntary sector development is an\nappreciation of the interplay between voluntary activity, place and the political\ncontext within which organisations operate. Local authority restructuring in\nScotland in 1996, meant that the geographical boundaries of many local\nauthorities changed and many voluntary organisations found that their\nboundaries were no longer co-terminous with that of the new local authority\nwithin which they were located (Craig and Manthorpe, 1999). For Glasgow,\nthis represented a change from regional to local government and presented\nconsiderable difficulties for voluntary organisations that were specifically set\nup to address a regional agenda. Others had to take decisions about whether to\ncontinue to operate across two or more local authority boundaries \u2013 with all the\nassociated funding and regulatory difficulties that entails \u2013 or whether to relocate\ntheir services to one geographically defined local authority (Milligan, 2001).\nSIP developments have added a further layer of complexity to the relationship\nbetween the voluntary sector and the local state that is of particular significance\nbecause it raises questions about how the development of voluntarism is bound\nup with new forms of governance in the city. In particular, it highlights the\nincreasing importance of institutions that are not bound by traditional forms of\naccountability to local electorates. The individual SIP boards have an important\ndegree of policy and fiscal discretion over the funding of voluntary sector projects\nin each SIP area that could be interpreted as a welcome development in terms\nof localism to social policy. Nevertheless, there are concerns about the more\nformal accountability of SIP boards to the wider community. Within Glasgow, the\nSIP agenda operates within the framework of the Glasgow Alliance (established\nin 1998) whose members include the City Council, the Glasgow Development\nAgency, the Scottish Executive and the Glasgow Council for the Voluntary\nSector. The Alliance is an independent body \u2013 its independence being viewed\nas crucial to its success in terms of depoliticising initiatives. Indeed, under the\nSIP arrangement, it would appear that the role of local government is largely that\nof a \u2018strategic enabler\u2019 rather than a central player. Of course this must not be\noverstated given that the City Council continues to play a key role in the funding of\nvoluntary sector organisations. Nevertheless, in areas of most acute deprivation,\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\ngeographical perspectives on voluntary activity 87\nthe development of voluntarism is being significantly influenced by institutions\nthat are largely funded centrally (i.e. from Edinburgh) and following an\nagenda that has no formal democratic mandate. As one council official explained:\n\u2018The decisions are taken locally over which we have no direct control. You could\nargue that a councillor is on the board [of each SIP] but the councillor can be\noutvoted and quite often is.\u2019\nThe complexity of the relationship between the voluntary sector and the\nstate has been compounded by devolution and the investiture of the Scottish\nParliament, in 1999, with many of those powers relating to social welfare\npreviously held by Government at Westminster. As a consequence, the political\nlandscape in Scotland has changed significantly since the mid-1990s and voluntary\norganisations have found themselves having to forge new relationships and\ndevelop new spaces within which to they might influence policy at the levels\nof both local and national government.\nAt the level of national (Scottish) government, voluntary organisations have\nbeen quick to seize the opportunities presented by devolution, with national\norganisations pointing to an increased level of accessibility and activity between\nthe voluntary sector and the Scottish Executive. Organisations have indicated to\nan increase in requests for their input into parliamentary enquiries and an intens-\nification of joint-working with other organisations with common aims, as they\njoin forces to lobby, organise joint manifestos and receptions for MSPs (Members\nof the Scottish Parliament) to raise awareness on specific issues of common\ninterest. As a respondent from one national mental health organisation explained,\n\u2018There have been a number of changes since devolution. The physical proximity\n[of the Parliament] makes a difference. It\u2019s now much more common for us\nto engage in both formal and informal meetings . . . We are devoting much\nmore time and energy to lobbying Scottish Parliament than we do Westminster,\nbecause the Scottish Parliament has control of so many issues that are of direct\nrelevance to us. Our lobbying of Westminster is really now restricted to benefits\nissues.\u2019\nClearly, the inter-dependencies between voluntary organisations and the\nstate are complex. In part this is because the state itself is highly complex. Yet this is\nnot the whole story; in examining three different areas of social welfare voluntary\nactivity, we found key differences in their relationships with the different tiers\nof government. Some groups are much more connected to local and\/or national\ngovernment than others and hence exhibit very different patterns of ability\nto affect policy, which in turn impacts on sub-sectoral development within\nplaces.\nThis was particularly evident within the black and ethnic minority sector.\nGlasgow has a large number of small black and ethnic minority organisations\nthat have limited contact with the state. There is also evidence of a generational\ndivide within this sub-sector, with older, more established organisations\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\n88 christine milligan and nicholas r. fyfe\ncharacteristically demonstrating a passive relationship with statutory actors,\nwhilst newer organisations, with younger management boards, are more\nchallenging. However, it is also important to recognise that the tendency amongst\npolicy-makers to refer to ethnic minority organisations under the label of\n\u2018black and ethnic minority\u2019 groups can, of itself, be profoundly unhelpful in\nthat it highlights a failure to recognise the diversity of the populations these\norganisations were set up to serve. As the co-ordinator of one Muslim organisation\nput it, \u2018we have to realise that Muslims, generally, are a totally different kettle of\nfish \u2013 because the needs of a Muslim and the solutions to their problems are\ntotally different from a Hindu or a Sikh or someone who is Chinese\u2019. This\nsentiment was reinforced by other respondents from black and ethnic minority\norganisations who highlighted state-funders\u2019 insistence on the provision of multi-\ncultural services \u2013 often set up in, or next to, temples, mosques or other religious\nplaces.\nOverall, we found limited evidence that black and ethnic minority\norganisations are, as yet, well integrated into strategic-level decision-making.\nThis is particularly true at the level of the local authority. And, while there is\nevidence that government at both local and national levels is making concerted\nefforts to consult these organisations on policy issues, they have yet to recognise\nthat the extent of consultation is proving problematic for small, locally based\norganisations, with limited resources to cope with. As one organisational\nleader commented, \u2018If we went to all the meetings that the Local Authority\nexpects people to go to, \u2018cause they\u2019re liasing with the black community, you\nwouldn\u2019t get any work done ! A number of years ago we were campaigning\nfor people to actually be consulted. The problem is now you\u2019re consulted to\ndeath!\u2019\nWhile, in part, variations in the relationship between voluntary organisations\nand the local and national states are linked to organisational size and the ability\nof larger organisations to command greater political resources, this is not the\nwhole picture. While the local state needs to maximise opportunities for all\norganisations to contribute to the consultative process, contrary to much of the\nliterature surrounding the ability of voluntary organisations to influence the state\n(e.g. Kramer, 1986), we would argue that size, of itself, is not necessarily a limiting\nfactor. Organisations, despite being small and locally based, can develop and\neffectively use their social networks and the uniqueness of their services to open\nup opportunities to influence the policy process. As the co-ordinator of a mental\nhealth organisation explained, \u2018I don\u2019t think I would have a snowball in hells\nchance of influencing the social work committee on anything. Because it would\nbe, \u201cOh, who\u2019s she?\u201d However, I\u2019m tied into a social work network that would\nbe represented at those meetings, so our aim is to ensure that the senior officers\nin the council are aware of what we\u2019re doing . . . What you have to do is develop\nalternatives to existing systems.\u2019\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\ngeographical perspectives on voluntary activity 89\nIt is important to note, however, that not all organisations are concerned\nto influence the wider policy process. Some community-based organisations are\nconcerned only to improve the quality of life within their own localities and\nso have little interest in influencing activity outside these very specific places.\nFurther, there is a long history of complementary working in some areas of\nvoluntary activity, as for example, with health-related voluntary organisations\nand the statutory sector (particularly in the health and social services). As a result,\norganisations in these sub-sectors have developed closer working relationships\nwith the state and so have a greater understanding of where best to target their\npolitical resources \u2013 lessons that newer sectors are still in the process of developing.\nAs the co-ordinator of one organisation working in the field of crime and criminal\njustice noted, \u2018I\u2019m seconded to the Chief Executive\u2019s [office] and I have staff\nfrom the Chief Executive\u2019s office working for community safety. I also have\nstaff from the Fire Brigade and the Police, so its worked out very well in terms of\ninforming policy, in that I would be responsible for writing papers to committee \u2013\nto policy resources, to social inclusion \u2013 on aspects related to community\nsafety.\u2019\nRather than the voluntary sector lying between the local state and civil society,\nthese shifts in the relationship between the voluntary sector and different tiers\nof government place politics in new locations \u2013 both beyond and inside state-\ncentred spaces. While it is too early to assess the full impact of these changes in the\nScottish context, they are illustrative of an increased blurring of the boundaries\nbetween the voluntary sector and the state and the emergence of new political\nspaces, where state and civil society can be seen to overlap, highlighting some\nof the ways in which old spaces of political activity are being redefined and new\nspaces are emerging.\nDiscussion\nWe set out at the beginning of this paper to address two main questions: firstly\nwhat is that geographers do that will be of interest to those working in the\nfield of social policy; and, secondly, why is this important from a social policy\nperspective?\nIn responding to these questions, we have drawn attention to some of the ways\nin which geographical perspectives can contribute to a greater understanding of\nthe uneven development of the voluntary sector across space, how organisations\nbecome embedded in particular places and their relationships with local, regional\nor national political contexts. By drawing on the findings from the Glasgow study,\nwe have begun to unravel some of the complex web of inter-relationships that\noperate across those geographical and political spaces that extend from the local\nto the national, to reveal some unique insights into those factors that act to\nfacilitate or constrain the development of voluntary activity across the city.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\n90 christine milligan and nicholas r. fyfe\nWhile mapping the voluntary sector offers a starting point from which\nexamine the uneven distribution of the voluntary sector, a more in-depth analysis\nreveals how it is affected by a complex range of influences that operate at both the\nmacro-and micro-scale. These range from pragmatic siting strategies associated\nwith available space and the need to constrain costs, to awareness of the highly\nspecific needs of the client group the organisation was set up to serve. But this is\nnot the whole story; voluntary sector development within places and across space\nis also influenced by the local and national policy environments within which\nit operates. In particular, government programmes aimed at reducing social\nexclusion and deprivation, combined with the uncertain funding environment\nwithin which voluntary organisations operate, act to lay down layers of time-\nlimited state funding in parts of the city, with an agglomerating effect on other\npotential funding opportunities. So while on the one hand changes in state\nfunding programmes can act to create a dynamic mosaic of opportunities for\nvoluntary organisations to develop in geographically defined communities, on\nthe other these developments can also contribute to local networks of access and\nexclusion. Understanding the characteristics of place thus provides important\ninsights into the uneven distribution of the voluntary sector with implications\nfor access, service delivery and policy development.\nThe promotion of active and inclusive communities is key to both the\nGovernment\u2019s Active Communities agenda and the Social Inclusion Programme.\nAs we have illustrated, however, the extent to which voluntary organisations\nsuccessfully engage with local communities is shaped largely by organisational\ngrowth, the extent to which they attempt to harmonise services and their drive\ntoward professionalisation. The extent of local autonomy over the development\nand delivery of services is dependent on whether an organisation serves a local,\nregional or national agenda. Local autonomous organisations tend to display\nflattened decision-making structures, where policy formation lies close to the\ncommunities in which they operate. At the other extreme, those serving regional\nor national agendas tend towards hierarchical decision-making structures where\ndecision-making is increasingly distanced from local volunteers and service\nusers. This has important implications for the extent to which voluntary\norganisations are able to form local attachments, impacting on the development\nof the voluntary landscape across the city. Local connections between voluntary\norganisations and the community thus appear to operate on a continuum\nbetween local and national, based on their bureaucratic and organisational\nstructures.\nUnderstanding the interplay between voluntary activity, place and political\ncontext is also important. We have drawn attention to the differing political\nlandscapes within which voluntary organisations operate and how their\nrelationships with the state \u2013 and hence their ability to influence the policy\nprocess at both local and national levels \u2013 is affected by these environments.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 Mar 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.9\ngeographical perspectives on voluntary activity 91\nRecent changes in the Scottish political landscape, at both local and national\nlevels, has had an important impact on voluntary sector development, with\norganisations finding themselves having to forge new relationships in the local\nand national policy arenas. However, we have also illustrated how voluntarism is\nbound up with new forms of governance across Glasgow, in which the local state\nis becoming more a strategic enabler than a central player. Such developments are\ncreating new places in which the politics of the city are being played out. Yet it is\nalso clear that differing groups within the voluntary sector have differing abilities\nto access these new sites of governance (and hence the political agenda), raising\nquestions about the extent to which voluntary and community partnership in\nthe delivery of social welfare may be contributing to an increase in the so-called\ndemocratic deficit.\nFor those working in the field of social policy, then, the promise of taking\na geographical approach to voluntarism is to insist that where these events are\ntaking place matters to both their form and outcome (Brown, 1997).\nNotes\n1 LOVAS surveys were commissioned by the Home Office (Westminster) to assess the\nvitality and resources of voluntary action at local level across England and Wales (but not\nScotland). Its aim has been to provide researchers with a systematic methodology to enable\ncomparability across different studies. Adoption of this schema has not been unproblematic,\nand whilst we do not discuss this here, it is an issue that we address in other work arising\nfrom this project.\n2 While most SIPs are spatially defined, the strategy does make small provision for theme-\nbased SIPs. Three currently exist in Glasgow: Routes Out of Prostitution; Glasgow Anti-Racist\nAlliance, The Big Step (care leavers).\nAcknowledgement\nThis study was funded by the ESRC Reference No: R000223093.\nReferences\nAmin, A., Cameron, A. and Hudson, R.
