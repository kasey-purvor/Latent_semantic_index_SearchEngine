Electrostatic interactions between ions in an ionic channel and the charge\nfluctuations in the channel mouth are considered. It is shown that the charge fluctuations\ncan be enhanced in channels of low dielectric constant, resulting in strong modulation of the\npotential barrier at the selectivity site. It is conjectured that similar effects can alter transition\nprobabilities in other molecular dynamical systems.\n1. Introduction\nElectrostatic interactions and fluctuations play crucial roles in controlling transition\nprobabilities, conduction and selectivity in nanoscale molecular systems. It is well-known that\nthe long-range Coulomb interaction leads to a strong correlation of ion motion and is responsible\nfor the ions\u2019 distribution and the energy fluctuations in electrolytes [1, 2]. However, in the\ntraditional approach to the calculation of escape rates in molecular biology, charge fluctuations\nin the bulk are usually neglected [3]. In particular, volume charge fluctuations are usually not\ntaken into account in relation to the problem of ion passage through an open ion channel [4, 5].\nOn the one hand it is known that narrow channels of low dielectric constant in the channel walls\nposses high potential barriers preventing easy passage of ions through the channels [6, 7]. On\nthe other hand, however, ion channels can be very good conductors passing up to 108 ions per\nsecond [8]. The difficulties in explaining these and other facts using thermal fluctuations as the\nonly source of noise in molecular systems are also well known [3].\nIn this paper we consider the effect of charge fluctuations on the probabilities of transition of\nions through an open ionic channel in addition to the effect of thermal fluctuations. We argue\nthat open ionic channels can be viewed as electrostatic amplifiers of the charge fluctuations. I.e.\nthe change in the potential barrier \u2206E induced by the charge fluctuations can be amplified very\nsignificantly in the presence of the channel walls of small dielectric constant. As a result, the\ntransition probabilities for an open channel whose potential barrier is at the selectivity site can\nbe substantially increased.\nSpecifically, we consider ion transport across a lipid membrane with a small dielectric\nconstant, describing the motion via a self-consistent solution of the coupled Poisson and Langevin\nElectrostatics 2007 IOP Publishing\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 142 (2008) 012049 doi:10.1088\/1742-6596\/142\/1\/012049\nc\u00a9 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd 1\nequations for ions moving in an open ionic channel [9, 10]. We investigate numerically the\ndistribution of ionic arrival times, and the charge fluctuations at the channel mouth, and compare\nthem with theoretical predictions. Next, the electrostatic energy profile of one ion in an aqueous\nchannel through a lipid membrane, charged at the selectivity site, is calculated in the case when\nnegative charge at the selectivity site produces a potential well for a positive ion in the channel.\nFinally, we consider the electrostatic coupling between charge fluctuations in the channel mouth\nand the energy fluctuations for the ion at the selectivity site.\nWe will show that the volume charge fluctuations in the channel mouth can be modeled as\na generalized shot noise. They result in strong modulation of the potential barrier for an ion at\nthe selectivity site on a sub-nanosecond timescale. We provide an analytic approximation of the\namplification of the electrostatic interaction between the ions in the channel.\n2. The conjecture\nThe key idea of the paper is based on estimation of the force of interaction between two ions of\ncharge q in a medium of dielectric constant \u00b2 separated by a distance r (cf. [11])\nF =\nq2\n4pi\u00b2\u00b20r2\n. (1)\nSince F \u221d 1\u00b2 , it is clear that the strength of the interaction between ions in dielectrics of large\n\u00b2 (e.g. water \u00b2H20 = 80) is much weaker than in dielectrics of small \u00b2 (e.g. protein \u00b2p = 2). In\nionic solutions in water, the interaction between the ions is further weakened by screening.\nTherefore, there are at least two main factors contributing to the amplification of the\ninteraction between ions in narrow channels, as compared to interaction between ions in bulk\nsolutions in water. First, narrow channels are likely to be singly occupied. As a consequence\nan ion situated at the selectivity site in the middle of the channel can feel volume charge at\nthe channel mouth without screening. Secondly, the effective dielectric constant of the channel\nmust have a value intermediate between \u00b2H20 = 80 and \u00b2p = 2. The latter can be seen as follows.\nConsider a narrow channel of length d and radius r such that r \u00bf d. Introduce an effective value\nof the dielectric constant of the channel to take account of ion-induced charge on the channel\nwalls. For r \u2192 0 the effective dielectric constant of the channel must go to that of protein,\n\u00b2 \u2192 2, while for r \u2192 \u221e \u00b2 must go to that of water, \u00b2 \u2192 80. It is therefore clear that, at finite\nr, the effective dielectric constant of the channel has an intermediate value and the smaller the\nradius r becomes the smaller will be the effective dielectric constant.\nIn addition, we suggest that, on the timescale of an ion\u2019s transition through an open channel,\nvolume charge fluctuations at the channel mouth are of the shot noise type (cf. [4]). They\nmust be amplified by the ion channel leading in turn to a strong modulation of the transition\nprobabilities.\nTo illustrate this conjecture we model numerically an open ion channel in the standard\nconfiguration [12, 13].\n3. Method\nThe system considered is comprised of three compartments (see Fig. 1 (left)). The middle block\nconstitutes the protein through which there is a cylindrical hole approximating the open channel.\nThe channel is bathed with a solution of NaCl at its left and right ends. The electrostatic force\nand potential are produced by the moving ion, and by fixed charge at the surface, particularly\nthe net negative charge carried by a fraction of the protein at the channel\u2019s selectivity filter.\nThe fixed charge of value \u22121 e is taken to be at the center of the channel within one finite\nvolume element of the protein as shown in Fig. 1(left). The small dot on the channel axis is\nthe ion moving on the channel axis. Since the dielectric constant of the aqueous pore is not yet\nElectrostatics 2007 IOP Publishing\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 142 (2008) 012049 doi:10.1088\/1742-6596\/142\/1\/012049\n2\nknown for narrow channels, we use as a first approximation the same dielectric constant as for\nthe aqueous bath \u00b22 = 80. The dielectric constant of the protein embedded in the membrane is\ntaken to be \u00b21 = 2.\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\nAxial distance (A)\nR\nad\nia\nl d\nis\nta\nnc\ne \n(A\n)\nProtein\n\u03b5=2\nWater\n\u03b5=80\n0 4 8\n0\n0.04\n0.08\n0.12\n\u03c1(\nr)\nr, A\n \n \nNa\u2212Na\nNa\u2212Cl\nCl\u2212Cl\nFigure 1.

The distance\nbetween ions i and j is rij . The overall strength of the potential and the contact distance\nbetween ions pairs are represented respectively by U0 and Rc. We note that an experiment [15]\nElectrostatics 2007 IOP Publishing\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 142 (2008) 012049 doi:10.1088\/1742-6596\/142\/1\/012049\n3\nand theory [16, 17] demonstrate oscillatory behavior of the potential of the mean force between\nthe like ions in water. The oscillating part of the potential is taken into account explicitly by\nadding third term in the square brackets to the Eqs. (2) and (3), where aw is the oscillation\nlength, ae the exponential drop parameter and Rij is the origin of the hydration force which is\nslightly shifted from Rc by +0.2 A\u02da for like ions and by \u22120.2 A\u02da otherwise [12].\nThe dielectric force acting on the ion as it moves on the channel axis Fch is calculated\nnumerically by solving the Poisson equation in 3D space with cylindrical symmetry [18]\n\u2212\u2207 \u00b7 (\u00b2(~r)\u2207\u03c6(~r)) = \u03c1(~r), ~D = \u00b2 ~E, ~E = \u2212~\u2207\u03c6, (4)\nusing the finite volume method (FVM) [19]. In Eq. (4), \u00b2 = \u03b5k\u03b50 is the space dependent\ndielectric function with k= 1 or 2 and \u03b50 = 8.85 \u00d7 10\u221212 CV\u22121m\u22121 is the dielectric constant\nof empty space. \u03c1 is the source density, \u03c6 is the potential, ~D and ~E are respectively the\ndisplacement vector and the electric field. An effective dielectric constant is introduced at the\ninterface between the water and the protein. The latter procedure is more appropriate when\nthe dielectric function undergoes a severe jump. In order to preserve cylindrical symmetry, the\nmoving ion is required to stay on the channel axis. Dirichlet boundary conditions are used to fix\nthe value of the electrostatic potential on the left and right boundaries of the system, as used\nin experimental measurement. The Neumann boundary condition is used to set the value of the\nnormal component of the electric field. A standard iterative method is used to solve algebraic\nlinear system derived from the discrete Poisson equation. The results are stored in tables, thus\nfacilitating fast, self-consistent, BD simulations.\nWe used the following parameters for the simulations:\nDielectric constants: \u03b52 = 80, \u03b51 = 2;\nMasses (in kg): mNa = 3.8\u00d7 10\u221226, mCl = 5.9\u00d7 10\u221226;\nDiffusion coefficients (in m2s\u22121): DNa = 1.33 \u00d7 10\u22129, DCl = 2.03 \u00d7 10\u22129 (Note that D is\nrelated to the friction coefficient via D = kBTm\u03b3 .);\nIon radii (in A\u02da): rNa = 0.95, rCl = 1.81;\nTemperature: T = 298 K.\nTo see how the hydration effect can be taken into account at the selectivity filter we consider\nfirst the effect of hydration in the bulk following the simplified description adopted in [20, 21].\nThe parameters of the ion-ion interaction used in the calculations are presented in Table. 1.\nIons U0[kBT] Rc[A\u02da] R[A\u02da] aw[A\u02da] ae[A\u02da]\nNa-Na 0.5 3.50 3.7\nNa-Cl 8.5 2.76 2.53 2.76 1.4\nCl-Cl 1.4 5.22 5.42\nTable 1. Parameters used in the calculation of the short range ion-ion interaction with\nhydration.\nA test of accuracy of the simulation is carried by performing the simulation in bulk solutions,\nwith a concentration of 400mM. Initially, ions are injected randomly with zero velocity in the\nsimulation domain. Reflective boundary conditions are set on the faces of the boxes. When ion\npasses through the channel (e.g. from the left to the right) an ion is removed from the far right\nend and injected at the far left end of the system. This way, maintaining the number of ions\nin the simulation box constant. Ions are then left to relax before the ion-ion radial distribution\nfunction is calculated.\nElectrostatics 2007 IOP Publishing\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 142 (2008) 012049 doi:10.1088\/1742-6596\/142\/1\/012049\n4\n0 1 2\n0\n40\n80\n\u03c4\nar\n\u03c1(\n\u03c4\na\nr)\n \n \n\u03c4\nar\n\u2248 471 ps,  e\u2212\n\u03c4\nar\n\u2248 365 ps, e+\n0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3\n\u22122\n\u22121.5\n\u22121\n\u22120.5\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\nt, ns\nC\nha\nrg\ne,\n e\nFigure 2.

An oscillatory shape (cf. [15, 22\u201324]) of the distribution (going to zero\nfor distances less than the interionic separation) is clearly seen in the figure. We note that the\nresults shown in the Fig. 1 (right) closely reproduce the earlier results of [23].\n4. Distribution of arrival times and the charge fluctuations\nWe focus here on an effect of volume charge fluctuations at the channel mouth on the transition\nprobabilities of the ions through an open ionic channel. To this end we would like to estimate\nhow much time ions spend in the channel mouth and how often they arrive there. On the\nassumption of charge neutrality and no applied field, the arrival times of ions at the channel\nmouth from a solution can be estimated [3, 25] by considering pure diffusion of ions through the\nhemisphere at the mouth of the channel and is given by \u03c4ar = 1\/(2piziNADirc0); where r is the\nchannel radius, c0 the bulk concentration, NA Avogadro\u2019s number, zi and Di the charge valence\nand the diffusion coefficient of the ith ion. For an NaCl solution of concentration c0 = 500mM,\nthe estimated arrival time \u03c4ar \u223c 2.9\u00d7 10\u22129s for Na+ and \u03c4ar \u223c 3.8\u00d7 10\u22129s for Cl\u2212.\nTo estimate the charge fluctuations from the simulations we have recorded continuously\n(during a few microseconds) the total positive and negative charge in the channel mouth within\na volume vM = pir2\u00d7r, where r = 6 A\u02da. The arrival time was estimated by recording the intervals\nbetween ion arrivals at the channel mouth. The results of the simulations are summarized in\nFig. 2(left). It can be seen from the figure that the arrival time distribution follows an exponential\ndistribution with mean arrival time \u03c4ar \u223c 3.6\u00d7 10\u22129s for Na+ and \u03c4ar \u223c 4.7\u00d7 10\u22129s for Cl\u2212.\nThis corresponds to a Poisson process as expected from the theory [4, 26] and have important\nimplications for modeling channel conduction [27, 28]. We show that the presence of a second\nion at the channel mouth significantly modulates the energy barrier that a first ion, initially\ntrapped at the channel selectivity filter, has to overcome in order to cross the channel.\nElectrostatics 2007 IOP Publishing\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 142 (2008) 012049 doi:10.1088\/1742-6596\/142\/1\/012049\n5\n0 20 40 60 80\u22124\n0\n4\n8\nE\n, k\nB\nT\nx, A\n(a)\n0 20 40 60 80\u22124\n\u22122\n0\n2\n4\nE\n, k\nB\nT\nx, A\n\u2206 E0\n\u2206 E1\n(b)\nFigure 3.

The\nsolid (blue) and dashed (red) lines correspond to the channels with and without fixed charges,\nrespectively. The profile of a passive channel (\u00b2protein = 80) is indicated by the dotted (black)\nline. The channel is situated between 30 and 60 A\u02da, as indicated by the vertical dashed lines.\n(b) The potential energy profiles as a function of the position of the ion when: the first ion is\nfixed at the channel mouth (dashed line) and the second is moving along the channel axis. The\npotential energy of the passive channel is shown by dotted line. The vertical dashed lines show\nthe channel entrance and exit. The height of the potential energy barrier seen by a single ion\nat the selectivity site as it moves from left hand to right hand of the channel is denoted \u2206E0.\nIn the presence of a second ion at the channel\u2019s left mouth this barrier is reduced to \u2206E1.\n5. Amplification of the electrostatic interaction between two ions in the channel\nWe now consider the effect of the charge fluctuations on the transition probabilities of the ions\nthrough an open ionic channel. First, we analyze the energy profile faced by one ion moving\nthrough the channel.\nThe total electrostatic energy required to move one ion from the bulk solution into a bare\nchannel that is 30 A\u02da long and 4 A\u02da in radius as a function of the position of the ion is calculated\nas shown in Fig. 3(a). The potential drop across the channel is \u2206\u03a6 = 90 mV, the charge at\nthe selectivity site (in the middle of the channel) is \u22121 e. Note that the value of the potential\nbarrier for the ion at the selectivity site to exit the channel from left to right is \u2206E0 as shown\nin Fig. 3(b). We now consider the reduction of this potential barrier induced by the second ion\nsituated at the channel\u2019s left mouth (x = 32 A\u02da) while the first is moving along the channel axis.\nThe choice of this location follows from our earlier demonstration of the charge fluctuations at\nthe channel\u2019s left mouth as we are interested to the effect this will have on the energy of the\nfirst ion at the selectivity filter. The potential energy profile as a function of the position of the\nfirst ion moving along the channel when the second ion is located at the channel\u2019s left mouth\nis shown by the dashed line in Fig. 3(b). It can be seen that the presence of a second ion at\nthe channel\u2019s left entrance decreases the potential energy barrier seen by an ion at the channel\u2019s\nselectivity filter to \u2206E1. We note the reduction of the potential energy barrier from \u2206E0 to \u2206E1\nis much stronger in the channel of low dielectric constant. I.e. the effect of charge fluctuation is\nstrongly enhanced by the protein\u2019s low dielectric constant compared to water.

Analytic approximation of the effect of the amplification\nA simple one-dimensional approximation of the Poisson equation for a channel with r \u00bf d can\nbe derived [29\u201331] and written in dimensionless form as:\n\u03a6\u00a8\u2212 \u03b2\u03a6 = \u2212\u03b2\u2206(1\u2212 x)\u2212 \u03b1P (x)\u2212 \u03b1\u03b4(x\u2212 x0)\u2212 \u03b1\u03b4(x\u2212 x1) (5)\n\u03a6(0) = 0, \u03a6(1) = \u2206\nwhere \u03b2 = d\n2\u03b5\u02dc\n\u03b50\u03b5H2O\nis a function of the effective dielectric parameter \u03b5\u02dc = \u03b5p\u03b5H2O\n2\u03b50\nr2 ln(d\/r)\n. The\nfactor \u03b1 = \u03ba2d2 where \u03ba\u22121 =\n\u221a\n\u03b50\u03b5H2Ov0UT\ne is the Debye length with v0 = pir\n2d; the volume of\nthe cylindrical channel. UT = kBT is the thermal energy, where kB is Boltzmann\u2019s constant\nand T the absolute (room) temperature. P (x) is the permanent charge distribution on the\nprotein atoms, independent of the electric field. The \u03b4 function represents two moving ions\nat different locations x0 and x1 on the channel axis. Because the Poisson equation is linear,\nthe contributions from the four terms on the right hand side can be considered independently.\nHere we concentrate on the interaction between two ions in the channel in the presence of an\nexternal field corresponding to the applied voltage \u2206 in Eq. (5). The analytic solution can easily\nbe obtained by transforming Eq. 5 to a boundary value problem with identical boundaries by\nlinearly changing \u03a6 [32], and is\n\u03a6(x) =\n\u2206\nsinh\n\u221a\n\u03b2\n(sinh\n\u221a\n\u03b2x+ sinh\n\u221a\n\u03b2(x\u2212 1))\u2212\u2206(x\u2212 1)\n\u2212\u03b1\n\u222b 1\n0\nG(x, s)P (s)ds\nElectrostatics 2007 IOP Publishing\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 142 (2008) 012049 doi:10.1088\/1742-6596\/142\/1\/012049\n7\n\u2212 \u03b1\u221a\n\u03b2 sinh\n\u221a\n\u03b2\n\uf8f1\uf8f2\uf8f3\nsinh\n\u221a\n\u03b2x sinh\n\u221a\n\u03b2(x0 \u2212 1) + sinh\n\u221a\n\u03b2x sinh\n\u221a\n\u03b2(x1 \u2212 1), 0 \u2264 x \u2264 x1\nsinh\n\u221a\n\u03b2x0 sinh\n\u221a\n\u03b2(x\u2212 1) + sinh\u221a\u03b2x sinh\u221a\u03b2(x1 \u2212 1), x1 \u2264 x \u2264 x0\nsinh\n\u221a\n\u03b2x0 sinh\n\u221a\n\u03b2(x\u2212 1) + sinh\u221a\u03b2x1 sinh\n\u221a\n\u03b2(x\u2212 1), x0 \u2264 x \u2264 1\n(6)\nwhere the Green function is given by:\nG(x, s) =\n1\u221a\n\u03b2 sinh\n\u221a\n\u03b2\n{\nsinh\n\u221a\n\u03b2x sinh\n\u221a\n\u03b2(s\u2212 1), 0 \u2264 x \u2264 s\nsinh\n\u221a\n\u03b2s sinh\n\u221a\n\u03b2(x\u2212 1), s \u2264 x \u2264 1. (7)\nThe distribution of the permanent charge is modelled using a narrow Gaussian distribution with\nmean \u00b5 = 0.5 (corresponding to the middle of the channel)and variance \u03c3 = 0.005, consistent\nwith the fact that the charge is mainly concentrated in the central part of the channel:\nP (x) =\n1\u221a\n2pi\u03c32\nexp(\u2212(x\u2212 \u00b5)\n2\n2\u03c32\n).\nUsing this approximation, the current\u2013voltage characteristics of the channel can be\ncalculated [32] and compared to experimental result and to full 3D simulation of the Poisson-\nNernst-Planck equations [33].\nFig. 4 shows the analytic approximation of the potential energy of the ion as it is moved along\nthe channel axis. The full solid line is obtained when there is only one ion (with coordinate x0)\nmoving along the channel axis. The dashed line is obtained when one ion is fixed (at x1) near the\nmouth of the channel and the second ion ( x0) is allowed to move along the channel axis. When\nthere is an additional ion located at the channel mouth, there is a reduction in the depth of the\npotential well as obtained in previous numerical simulation. Note that this approximation refers\nonly to an ion inside the channel; it does not take into account the variation of the potential as\nthe ion approaches the channel mouth from the bulk solution.\n7. Conclusion\nWe have shown that energy fluctuations due to the correlated motion of ions in strong electrolytes\ncan be substantially enhanced in open ionic channels of low dielectric constant. Ion channels can\ntherefore be perceived as electrostatic amplifiers of the charge fluctuations. This may in turn lead\nto an exponentially strong modulation of the potential barrier for the ion at the selectivity site.\nThe resulting enhancement of the transition probabilities of ions through the open channels may\nbe the leading order contribution to transition probabilities calculated using standard theories\nthat neglect the effect of charge fluctuations. Electrostatic amplification of charge fluctuations\nseems likely to play a substantial role in nanoscale protein dynamics including, in particular,\nprotein folding.\nReferences\n[1] Debye P and Hu\u00a8ckel E 1923 Physik.
