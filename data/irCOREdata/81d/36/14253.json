It is also at the centre of many post-16 investments and\npolicy initiatives. The widespread use in recent years of the term 'information and\nlearning technology' (ILT) in further education (FE) colleges illustrates the particular\nfocus in that sector. This paper analyses why this conjunction of learning and technology\nis seen as so important and describes how it has been articulated in practice. It outlines\nthe scope of related research and how this matches the political and social imperatives,\nthe professional development concerns of staff in the sector, and the ever-changing\ntechnological context. In its summary of the pertinent research questions, the paper\nshows how research priorities can be and are being matched by concrete developmental\npractice.\nIntroduction\nRather like the pencil - whose departure was predicted in 1938 by the New York Times in the\nface of ever more sophisticated typewriters - the fax, the copier and paper documents refuse\nto be dismissed. People find them useful. Paper has wonderful properties - properties that lie\nbeyond information, helping people work, communicate and think together.\nHistorians have long argued that the story of the industrial revolution cannot be told by\nlooking at the train alone. Historians might as well whistle for all the effect they have\nhad. The myth of the train is far more powerful. Today it's the myth of information that\nis overpowering richer explanations (of) the changes society is experiencing.\n(Brown and Duiguid, 2000)\n31\nUrsula Howard Learning with IT: towards a research agenda - questions and issues\nIf we make the wrong technological choices, the e-university will be obsolete in the next\ndecade. If we make the wrong curriculum choices, we will end up spending massive\nsums to deliver learning materials to a very few students. If we adopt the wrong\npedagogic approach students will drop out and fail in large numbers.\n(O'Shea, 2000)\nFor many of our students who have extended histories of educational failure IT has the\npotential to transform the learning process by responding more effectively to individual\nlearning styles.\n(NLN, May 2000)\nIn a recent Further Education Development Agency (FEDA) consultation with colleges,\nlearning with IT was re-confirmed as one of the two top priority research issues in the FE\nsector along with research into 'effective teaching and successful learning'. The latter might\nwell be associated with concerns about the new post-16 inspection framework, which has\nfar greater emphasis on direct observation of teaching and learning than the outgoing\ninspection regimes. Nevertheless, there are strong signals that leaders of colleges and other\nproviders of learning opportunities are focused more on learners, quality and curriculum\ndelivery than five years ago.\nThe expressed need for research into learning with IT exemplifies the core purposes for all\neducational research: to extend and deepen our knowledge and assemble evidence to\naddress and support change in the learning environment, and to inform and influence\npolicy development. Often enough, a research issue does not emerge within a static or\nstable context. Education, and particularly post-16 education, has been in a state of\npermanent change for the last decade. At the present time, the structural arrangements for\nthe funding and planning of all post-16 learning outside FE are being radically reformed,\nshaped by the Learning and Skills Act 2000. Curricula and qualifications are being\nreformed: Curriculum 2000 substantially broadens the shape of study for 16-19-year-olds.\nGNVQs are being transformed into Vocational GCSEs and Vocational A levels, leading,\nwithin the general direction of policy, to new Foundation Degrees. In work-based learning,\nModern Apprenticeships are being restructured. The overall number of qualifications is to\nbe substantially reduced. A new overarching certificate, 'graduation', is being explored\nthrough which it is hoped everyone can achieve FE level 2 by age 19. A new Key Skills\nqualification is to be introduced in 2000-1 as an essential component of both academic\nand vocational programmes. At the same time, a major new drive is under way to reach the\nseven million adults who have problems with reading, writing and numeracy and improve\nthe opportunities available to them. IT is central to all these changes to the post-16\nlearning system. It is one of the designated key skills, part of the delivery of the\ncurriculum, and increasingly central to the overall shape, structure and provision of\nlearning opportunities.\nChange and the influence of IT\nIn terms of the pace of change, IT would appear to be the fastest moving research target of\nall. Tim O'Shea has argued that the technology itself does not move that fast (O'Shea,\n2000). To managers and teachers, however, it feels fast enough to cause anxiety. For\nexample, IT is a major focus of investment, and a recurring issue for speedy decision-\ntaking; consequently managers can fear making the wrong decisions. The universal\n32\nALT-J Volume 8 Number 3\nintroduction and widespread effects of new technologies appear to demand instant culture\nchange. For example, they raise questions about the nature of institutions and the way they\noffer learning. FE colleges have traditionally served local communities; in the techno-\nlogical world, with all its possibilities for instant global communication, the notion of\n'localness' is exploded and needs to be refocused in new possibilities of community. At\nworst, there are fears that 'colleges with walls' will be redundant in a dystopian world in\nwhich individuals commune one-to-one with technology.\nIt follows that, in a fast-changing world that is full of uncertainties, quick and practical\npieces of research (coupled with the dissemination of good practice, innovation and\ncurriculum development) are needed. These can help educators to investigate, validate and\nthen embed IT-based learning, inform management decisions, and help teachers to work\ndifferently, adapting their skills and learning new ones to use and apply IT to support\neffective learning. In some ideal world, all teachers, tutors and guidance professionals and\nall curriculum specialists could be versed in the latest technological developments. They\nwould understand how to apply the technology in support of every learner's goals. They\ncould automatically integrate their technological and pedagogic knowledge to create the\nright learning mix, coupled with the right technology mix for any student.\nHowever, we have a long way to go before this becomes a reality. Despite the excellent\npractice in some colleges, adult and work-based learning centres, the new post-16 sector is\nfar from ready for the large-scale adoption of electronic delivery methods. Providers need\nsupport to develop and improve their skills and knowledge of how IT can best support\nlearning. At the same time the current national picture contains a plethora of policy\ninitiatives and the potential for overlap and confusion in the minds of professionals and\nusers. While substantial new resources (for example IT-based learning centres in neigh-\nbourhoods, Learndirect centres, and a new National Learning Network for FE) are\nentirely welcome and much needed developments, coherence and connectivity between the\nmushrooming initiatives and the people running and using them should be high priorities.\nSimply investing in millions of additional computers is, of itself, not the solution. The\nreality is, rightly, more complicated and not susceptible to simplistic technological fixes.\nThe reality for IT research in FE\nRecent and current research, development activity and policy initiatives reveal needs on a\nlarge scale, and high levels of interest and commitment to research in IT. These activities\nalso reveal how much still needs to be achieved and the need for coherence in both\ndeveloping and investing in IT-based learning.\nEvidence of both the interest in, and potential for, IT research in FE is demonstrated by\nrecent initiatives such as the curriculum and staff development activities on FEDA's\nQUILT programme (1996-2001), and the surveys and consultations on which the\nprogramme has been based. The QUILT programme revealed the extent of development\nand support needs in the sector. The Further Education Resources for Learning (FERL)\nprogramme, managed by Becta, has successfully shared good practice, for example by\nincluding case studies illustrating pockets of excellent practice in its Website. The use of\nthis Website by college staff also illustrates the widespread need for information and\nuseable resources.\n\u2014\nUrsula Howard Learning with IT: towards a research agenda - questions and issues\nAt the same time, the new National Learning Network (NLN) initiative in FE has\nrecognized the importance of staff development in applying IT to learning and the value of\nnurturing innovation in the curriculum to exploit fully what IT can offer. An initial survey\nby Becta, which informed the NLN plan, revealed the state of existing technology in\ncolleges upon which developments must build and which itself must be enhanced.\nThe DfEE is to commission a major piece of research on information and communications\ntechnology (ICT) and learning and is setting up a research centre to work on the\napplication of IT to learning. Work is under way to apply the Further Education National\nTraining Organization (FENTO) standards to the use of ICT in teaching and learning.\nThis will be essential to create a systematic, 'learning-centred' approach to developing staff\nskills and improving the quality of the learning experience. The creation of the University\nfor Industry (Ufl) and its focus on direct access and screen-based learning acknowledges\nthe potential of ILT to engage more learners quickly, particularly in work-based settings,\nand to reach new groups of learners who have not traditionally participated in learning\nbeyond school, particularly low achievers. ILT-based learning offers the opportunity for\nshort bursts of learning which can be assessed and recognized through online methods.\nThere is no doubt that, to date, research programmes on learning with IT post-16 have\ntended to be short term, and instrumental to decision-making. They have concentrated on\nspeedy implementation of initiatives and supporting development rather than asking\nfundamental questions. Some current priorities in the sector further illustrate the point: it\nwould be useful to identify in each case more fundamental research questions which need\nto be asked: the paper returns to these later.\nFor example, from the current concerns and portfolios of FEDA and Becta and other\npartners in the NLN initiative, there is work under way looking at how to establish and\nmanage learning centres in the context of much existing practice and many recent national\nand international developments. This includes the identification of generic models, producing\ncriteria for judging effectiveness, and identifying the contexts in which the centres work best.\nAnalysis of the development of ICT-based learning centres, for example, will produce\nevidence about the role of technology in learning and the management of such centres.\nTracking learners and learning is particularly important in distributed, distance and open\nlearning environments, to maintain some coherence but also in relation to funding. Part of\nthe technological answer to this is reflected in the current interest in 'managed learning\nenvironments' (MLEs) which are defined to include the whole range of information\nsystems and processes of the college that contribute directly or indirectly to learning and\nlearning management. A group established by the Joint Information Systems Committee\nfor Integrated Environments for Learners is producing guidance for purchasers of MLEs.\nHaving invested heavily in IT equipment, colleges are still struggling with issues relating tc\nlearning materials. The need for digital and multiple media content produces a myriad ol\nquestions and concerns about availability, access, use, cataloguing, retrieval and storage, a;\nwell as issues of intellectual property rights and copyright. This can involve partnership;\nbetween public and private sectors to create learning materials, or major decisions b]\ncolleges to invest in such capability. There have been a number of important sector-wid<\ninitiatives involving the Language Development Network (LDN) and the FE Nationa\nConsortium (FENC).\n34\nALT-J Volume 8 Number 3\nThe incorporation of international standards, for example for metadata, in learning and\nassessment materials and back office systems, has necessitated contact between FE and HE\nand with the global IT community. This is a particular area where the decisions of the Ufl\nare having an influence on the sector. Running across all of these is the development and\nuse of Internet and intranet services in colleges, whether reflected in policies for acceptable\nuse or the skills of staff to create and manage Web-based environments and materials. An\nassociated issue is how to recruit and retrain technical staff in what can be a very\ncompetitive area of the labour market.\nMeanwhile, colleges have all recently been asked to submit approved ILT strategies to\nsecure further involvement in the NLN initiative. As part of this they are deciding how to\nreconcile and pay back capital investment in IT, how to make further investment decisions,\nand how to ensure revenue streams for upgrading and updating. This will determine\nwhether the sector and individual institutions are at the leading edge.\nSome of these priorities are referred to again below as we examine what this all means for\nthe research agenda.\nDoes IT work?\nEfficiency and effectiveness have also been at the centre of research concerns. Those\nresponsible for managing institutions and making investments in resources are rightly\nanxious to have 'harder' information about the return on their investment. It is useful to\nnote here that during Autumn 2000, FEDA will publish a report on the topic based on\nresearch undertaken as part of the FERL programme. This examines the outcomes of IT\ninitiatives in a number of sector colleges. And the impact of the NLN initiative itself is\nbeing evaluated by FEDA and a team from Sheffield Hallam University (as reported in\nanother paper in this edition).\nThe particular concern about how and whether IT 'works' has raised fears among the\nteaching workforce. This is inevitable in any industry when new technologies are\nintroduced; lecturers and others supporting learning are concerned about the impact of IT\non their role and even on their livelihood. The lessons of history are both comforting and\ndisturbing. Opportunities for work can be increased by the opportunities in the new\neconomic environments opened up by technology; but it is nearly always different work:\nchange is inevitable.\nResearch questions that appear to be finance-driven will fuel such concerns. But the big\nissue implied by such questions is how, not if, the nature of teaching, and the teaching\nprofession, will need to change to meet the demands of new learners and the 'new\nlearning'. We need to explore the development of new approaches, practices and standards\nfor teaching and associated professions, working with FENTO and other standards bodies.\nDevelopment work is needed to model and track the transformation of the role of teachers\nas their practice develops to become tutors, facilitators, supporters, coaches, advisers,\nmentors and, in the language of 'neighbourhood renewal' policies, 'animateurs' of\nlearning. The change may perhaps relate more to skills delivery than to knowledge. There\nwill still be a need for transmitting information and knowledge, including lecturing and\ninstructing. Undoubtedly, however, a new balance of approaches will develop and blur the\nboundaries between the different professionals engaged in post-16 learning.\n35\nUrsula Howard Learning with IT: towards a research agenda - questions and issues\nTo what extent does technological development itself really affect how we approach the\nfuture of post-16 learning - how people learn successfully, with whatever mix of\ntechnological and human interaction? At worst, the technology itself can blind us to the\nreal concerns about what is wrong with the education system, the world of work and life\npatterns for which learning prepares and re-prepares people. IT can be perceived as one of\nthe biggest drivers and instruments in building a better-educated, skilled, creative and\ninnovative workforce and society. The core purpose of research into IT and learning must\nbe systematically to enhance learning, using the best appropriate technologies available.\nComputers are simply the means to an end, not the end in itself.\nIn this context, the focus in IT-related research and practice has now strongly shifted to\nteaching and learning - and the need for ambitious and longitudinal studies to explore the\npotential of new technologies to enhance the learning process and to engage more people\nin learning. Learning with technology is seen to be central to debates about how to bring\nlearning closer to people and their real concerns in work and daily life.\nThe deeper context for research and IT\nIt is questionable how far the issues underlying our education system (for example, social\ndivisions, skill levels and competitiveness) will be fundamentally affected specifically by\ntechnological environments. However technology has offered a new context in which\nresearch can address endemic issues in post-16 learning and ask key questions. Apart from\nthe many human perspectives touched on above and later, these concern, firstly, the way in\nwhich institutions and the teaching and educational support professions will need to\nchange and develop if people are using interactive technologies at least as part of their\nlearning. Second is the question of whether IT will help to realize an inclusive learning\nsociety, build a more skilled and creative workforce, and change what, how, with whom and\nwhere people learn. Thirdly, it is about who makes those choices - the balance between\nindividual learners, communities, global economic forces and the state in determining\nlearning patterns and modes of delivery. Unsurprisingly, the biggest issues are the 'people\nissues'.\nSome current research questions which professionals are asking about technology and\nlearning include:\n\u2022 Is ICT just useful to motivate and to excite people to engage, that is, to stimulate\ndemand and participation, or does it really support learning? Do people ever learn\npurely on their own (whether with a screen, book or pen and paper) or is learning\nalways a social process?\n\u2022 What works for learners? What are the opportunities, and the pitfalls? How do people\nlearn with IT, what works for them and what does not? How can IT help to change the\ndelivery of learning in the interests of learners? How does information, through\nlearning, become knowledge? How will the twenty-first century 'autodidact' really\nlearn?\n\u2022 Is ICT simply a tool, or can the range of new technologies change fundamentally the\nway people live and learn? For example, does the availability of information on the Web\nmean that adult learners may be reluctant to go 'back to basics' when they can follow\n36\nALT-J Volume 8 Number 3\ntheir desires and curiosities - beyond the teacher-rationed materials and curriculum\nframeworks? Does it mean that people can forego learning, or 'forget'1 those basic skills\nthat technology can do for us - calculating number, spelling and grammar, for example\n- and concentrate on the skills and knowledge they really want? Does it matter if\npeople cannot easily write or draw by hand? Do the new skills replace, change or\ncomplement the old ones? What would be the wider implications of such fundamental\nshifts in human practices, ways of learning and expressing creativity?\nHow will effective use of technology for learning change the roles of teachers\/ tutors\/\nlecturers\/ advice and guidance professions\/ trainers\/ librarians and learning resource\nprofessionals?\nIs the notion of screen-based learning, whether as 100 per cent, or as a major element\nof the learning process, likely to succeed? Or is learning, as the evidence and history\nseem to suggest, essentially a social process which leads to the internalization of skills\nand knowledge by individuals? What is the likely balance?\nWhat is the impact of technology - including learning technology - on craft,\nmanufacturing and other vocational areas, where things are still physically made, of old\nand new materials, and how can its potential be exploited in learning? We do not all live\non 'thin air' (Leadbeater, 2000; DTI White Paper, 1998; Hughes and Mager, 2000).\nThe 'information society' and 'knowledge-driven economy' (twin concepts but whose\ndifferent emphases are themselves worthy of discussion) will use know-how, information\nand generic skills with an increasingly adaptable workforce, even in manufacturing and\ncraft and the arts - but how will the relationship change? What do providers of learning\nneed to be doing here to address the impact of new technologies? The focus on\ninformation creates myths which obscure the social and economic forces which are also\ndriving change. It also cloaks the realities of economic development and the breadth of\nthe skills base needed at local, national and global levels. Generic (key and basic) skills\nmay be critical and increasingly important, but craft and technician skills will remain\nimportant in FE and vocational learning. Research and enquiry are needed to understand\nthe range of vocational and life skills which will be needed in 'post-industrial' Britain.\nWhat does ILT already, and potentially, do to the way human beings in families,\nlocalities and nations communicate and interact for personal, educational, social and\neconomic motives?\nShould the nature of what we call learning, as we strive for a learning society, be altered\nto include much informal, individual and group learning, for example through the\nmedium of the Internet?\nWhat are the implications of electronic and mobile learning (e-learning and m-\nlearning) using WAP mobile phone, digital broadcasting and other emerging\ntechnologies for learning providers such as colleges and community education centres?\nAccess to the technology and to the learning it enables must remain at the centre of\nlearning with IT. The danger of developing IT 'haves' and 'have nots' will remain a\nconcern, including the potential for developing a new 'illiteracy' among the adult\n37\nUrsula Howard Learning with IT: towards a research agenda - questions and issues\npopulation. Age and gender are particular concerns. How can we communicate better\nwith disaffected young people and help them back into learning?\n\u2022 IT raises issues about uncontrolled access to information and communication, re-\ninvigorating debates about censorship and freedom of information, however\ndistasteful. IT can be seen as exacerbating inactivity and loss of drive especially among\nyoung people, raising associated health concerns. Computer games merit further\ninvestigation here, seen on the one hand as the new threat to learning, thinking and\nactive development and on the other as a major opportunity to exploit, to break down\nthe divide between playing and learning\/working.\nThe value and reality of IT research\nAs in most educational research, there is a perceived divide between investigating 'what\nworks' and deeper tunnelling into underlying issues, values and concepts. At the heart of\neveryone's concerns is the potential of IT to increase access, participation and success for\nlearners. It follows that the learning with IT research agenda needs to integrate both\naspects. Equally,-research must be directly linked with development activity, improvements\nin practice and innovation. The two sides must inform each other. This approach is central\nto FEDA's research effort (Stanton and Morris, 2000).\nThe post-16 learning with IT agenda must define terms broadly and clearly. Technology\nmust be an inclusive concept, perhaps remembering the tenets of 'educational technology',\nwhere what matters is what works to support effective teaching and learning. So, as well as\nPCs, Internets and intranets, CDs, laptops and palmtops, satellite and terrestrial TV,\nmobile phones and landlines, tele- and video conferencing, we should remember pencils\nand paper, paints, faxes, whiteboards and all the other technologies which refuse to lie\ndown and die. All of these, singly and in combinations, together with the persistent\ntechnologies from earlier ages, should be embraced. The agenda should be about multiple\nmedia, combinations assembled by providers to suit the needs of learners and users of the\neducation and training system.\nWe also need research now on how to exploit the newest technologies for learning. The new\nmobile phones, for example, have real potential to address some of our core concerns\nabout widening participation and social inclusion. With European and UK partners,\nFEDA is undertaking research into 'm-learnihg' funded through the EU fifth Framework\nInformation Society Technologies (1ST) initiative. The m-learning project's ultimate\nobjective is to develop and prove prototype products and services which will provide\ninformation, advice and guidance and portfolios of very small modules of learning by\nmeans of technologies which are inexpensive, portable and accessible to the majority of\nEU citizens. The products and services arising from the project will be designed to support\nthe development and achievement of lifelong learning objectives. The primary target\ngroups of the m-learning project will be young adults who are not currently engaged in\neducation or training; casual, temporary or self-employed adults; and adults in low-\npaid\/low-skill employment with basic or key skills learning needs.\nThe 'technology side' of the work will investigate the features offered by existing and\nforecast mobile devices and communications networks, and their feasibility for\n38 .\nALT-] Volume &\u2022 Number 3\ncontributing to lifelong learning. On the 'people side', the work will look at motivation,\npreferences and behaviour of young adults who currently use mobile phones and hand-\nheld electronic games. There is already relevant work relating to children at the University\nof Tampere in Finland. Our project will collate information and findings from this and\nother related research in Europe and elsewhere.\nAs far as learning is concerned, in the post-16 sector the concept is extremely broad and\nneeds to encompass informal as well as formal learning, learning in institutions and\nlearning outside the walls of public providers. Formal learning that leads to qualifications\nis central, particularly in 16-19 education, whether it is delivered through open, distance\nand e-learning or by sitting in groups in colleges. However, learning technologies open up\nhuge possibilities for informal learning for specific purposes and interests, for consumers,\nfor leisure interests, for fact-finding, exploring curiosities, reading, writing and relating.\nResearch, development, innovation\nFinally, what is the parallel development and innovation agenda? The most successful\nelement in the QUILT programme in stimulating culture change and curriculum\ndevelopment was a series of over 100 development projects run in colleges and managed as\na national initiative by FEDA. The projects were designed to enable curriculum specialists\nto help themselves, to explore applications of technology and to tailor projects\nappropriately to a specific learning environment. The projects also supported (for example)\nthe development of partnerships between providers, a focus on specific curriculum areas,\nintranet development across colleges and a managed approach to the cascading of good\npractice at national level. A key benefit was the development of action research skills\namong practitioners. This is not research with a capital R. It is ah example of fieldwork,\naction research and development to address change.\nPartly in recognition of the gains made by the QUILT development initiatives, the\nNational Learning Network (NLN) approach has been adopted in the new phase FE ILT\ndevelopment. The emphasis in the NLN is on innovation: a small number of larger\nprojects - twenty in total - will explore a variety of technologies for teaching and learning.\nThe coverage of the first twelve projects illustrates the sector's awareness of the issues and\nthe extent to which recent years have witnessed major advances in the use of technology.\nThe project details can be seen on the NLN website, where all the project reports will\neventually be available.\nConclusion\nThe FEFC's ILT committee (FEILTC), chaired by Jenny Scribbins, Principal of South\nThames College, has overseen research in ILT in the FE sector. The committee brings\ntogether expert bodies, principals and senior managers and national organizations across\nthe UK. The committee's work has helped the sector to tackle fragmentation and support\ncoherence. There has been close contact with the HE research community, JISC and\nUKERNA, and the IT industry. It will be important to develop a coherent approach and\nan overview of research in learning with IT across the new Learning and Skills sector.\nFEDA has a new role and remit as the organization appointed to lead the development of\nresearch capacity in colleges, in addition to work-based and community learning. FEDA\nwill be working with others to establish a much stronger research base for the future. This\n39\nUrsula Howard Learning with IT: towards a research agenda \u2014 questions and issues\nwill involve partnerships across the sector, with HE and others in the research community;\nthere will be a strong emphasis on networks, including e-networks, and databases to build\nmore coherence into our research efforts. The aim is to help FEDA to improve knowledge,\nsupport creativity and innovation, and cascade good practice. Learning with IT will remain\na top priority. It is a challenging agenda.\nNote\n1\n My thanks to Tim O'Shea who introduced me to Roland Barthes' concept of 'forgetting'.\nReferences\nDepartment of Trade and Industry (1998), Building the Knowledge Driven Economy, DTI\nWhite Paper, December.\nHughes, M., and Mager, C.
