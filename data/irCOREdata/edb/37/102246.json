The present \nstudy explored category effects in children\u2019s colour search. The relationship between \nlinguistic colour categories and perceptual categories was addressed by comparing \nnative speakers of languages differing in the number of colour terms. Experiment 1 \ncompared English and Kwanyama (Namibian) children aged 4 to 7 years on visual \nsearch, using target-distractor pairs (blue-green, blue-purple, red-pink) for which the \nKwanyama did not have distinct names. The presence of a category advantage in the \nEnglish, but not in the Kwanyama, suggested that linguistic boundaries may affect \nsearch performance. Experiment 2 examined visual search performance in the green-\nyellow and the blue-green region, in English and Himba (Namibian) 6-year-olds. The \nnumber of distractors was varied to assess search efficiency. Cross-category search \nwas more efficient than within-category search in the English group, but this \nadvantage was absent in the Himba. Increasing the number of distractors affected \nsearch speed in the English group, but not in the Himba. Overall these findings \nsuggest cross-language differences in categorical effects on colour search, but also in \nthe way the children performed the search. The nature of the category effect in search \nis discussed with respect to these findings. \n \n                                                                                                                 Categorical effects  3\n     Colour perception is categorical. The physically continuous spectrum appears as seven or \nso qualitatively different fuzzy edged bands that are labelled in English by basic colour terms \nsuch as red, green, yellow and blue. Two colours separated by a category boundary seem \nmore different than an equally spaced within-category pair, a marker for categorical \nperception (CP). While these categorical effects are well established, the answers to many \nfundamental questions about colour categorisation are unknown. Are perceptual colour \ncategories innate or acquired? Where in the perceptual-cognitive processing stream do they \naffect colour judgements? Are they invariant structures, solely determined by the physiology \nof our visual systems, or are they flexible? What is the relationship between perceptual \ncolour categories and linguistic colour categories?  Do linguistic categories map onto pre-\nexisting perceptual categories, or do linguistic categories create perceptual categories? \nThe current study addressed these issues in three ways. First, the effect of colour \ncategorisation in visual search by young children was explored. In adults, visual search for a \ncolour target is facilitated if the target is in a different category to the distractors (Daoutis, \nPilling, & Davies, 2005; Franklin, Pilling & Davies, 2004; Kawai, Uchikawa, & Ujike, \n1995), and this is consistent with categorical influences on early visual processes. Here, we \nexplored whether such category effects are found in children. Second, the origin of these \ncategorical effects was explored by comparing native speakers of languages whose linguistic \ncategories for colour differ. If CP is due to language learning rather than to hardwired \nperceptual structures, then CP in search should co-vary with linguistic category structure. \nThird, CP was explored developmentally across two language groups. If CP is affected by \nlanguage learning, then it should strengthen as linguistic competence grows and differences \nbetween the two language groups should increase with age. \n \n \n                                                                                                                 Categorical effects  4\nCategorical perception \nDiscrimination of pairs of stimuli separated by a category boundary is more accurate and \nfaster than discrimination of equally separated pairs in the same category. This pattern, which \nis the signature of categorical perception (Harnad, 1987), is illustrated in Figure 1.  It \nrepresents six stimuli, three greens and three blues (G3, G2, G1, B1, B2, B3) with the \ncategory boundary between G1 and B1. The distances among the stimuli represent distances \nin a \u2018colour space\u2019 such as Munsell or CIE (see: Hunt, 1987; Davies & Franklin, 2002)1. The \nkey test of CP is to compare performance on some task of cross-category pairs such as G1-\nB1, with equally separated within-category pairs (B1-B2, or G1-G2). If performance is better \nwith the cross-category pair than with the within-category pair, this is evidence for CP. For \ninstance, using a same-different task it is faster to decide that B1-G1 are different than to \ndecide that B1-B2 are different (Bornstein & Korda, 1984; \u00d6zgen & Davies, 2002; Pilling, \nWiggett, \u00d6zgen & Davies, 2003).  \nINSERT FIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE \nEquivalent results have been found using a two-alternative forced choice (2-AFC) \nmethod. Here, a target colour is followed by two test colours, one identical to the target and \none different. If the target is B1, then the key comparison is B1-B2 with B1-G1. The latter \ncross-category choice is more accurate and faster than the within-category choice (Pilling et \nal., 2003; Roberson & Davidoff, 2000). Similarly, the experiments we report here compare \nvisual search for a target among an array of same category distractors (e.g. G1 target among \nG2 distractors) with search when the target and distractors are in different categories (G1 \namong B1 distractors). As the similarity of target and distractors is the main determinant of \ndifficulty, and the within-category and cross-category separations are matched, any \ndifference between the two conditions implicates the effect of categorical differences \n(Daoutis et al., 2005; Franklin et al., 2004; Kawai et al., 1995). \n \n                                                                                                                 Categorical effects  5\nThe studies cited above converge to show that colour CP is a common effect. However, it \nis less clear what the origin of the effect is, as the characteristic signature is consistent with \nquite different explanations. These are considered next. \n \nPerceptual accounts of CP \nFirst, as the term implies, CP could be due to \u2018warping\u2019 of perceptual colour space. \nPerceptual distances in the boundary region are stretched relative to equivalent within-\ncategory regions, making cross-category discrimination easier than within-category \ndiscrimination. If CP is due to perceptual structure, this could be hardwired and driven by \nlow-level processes which occur before language during development. Evidence for colour \nCP in infants at four months (Bornstein, Kessen & Weiskopf, 1976; Franklin & Davies, 2004; \nFranklin, Pilling & Davies, 2005) is consistent with CP not being dependent on language. \nFurther, 2- and 3-year-olds show colour CP on a 2-AFC task and this is not related to how \nthey name the colours (Franklin, Clifford, Williamson, & Davies, 2005). Thus, perceptual \nand linguistic colour categories may be independent of each other, at least in infants and \nyoung children. \nOn the other hand, CP could also be learned and possibly sharpened by language \nlearning. \u00d6zgen and Davies (2002) found that colour discrimination, measured by a same-\ndifferent task, could be improved by practice, and improvement was specific to the training \nstimuli. They argued that equivalent perceptual learning during language learning could \nproduce CP because language directs attention to the boundary regions between categories. \nFor instance, if a child learned the term blue, this is often over generalised to include \nneighbouring colours such as green. Incorrect use of blue for a green would be corrected and \nthe child has to discover what the difference between blue and green is in order to use the \nterms acceptably. Equivalent generalisation within the blue category would produce a correct \n \n                                                                                                                 Categorical effects  6\nresponse that would not be corrected. Thus, the child would attend more to boundary regions \nthan to central regions, and this could produce increased sensitivity to boundary regions, and \nhence CP. They showed that an analogue of this conjectured learning process could be \nproduced in adults through training. Adults were trained to learn two new categories that split \ngreen or blue in half, with the new boundary at the centre of blue or green. Before training, \ndiscrimination in the middle of blue or green was worse than towards the boundary. After \nlearning the new categories, discrimination was now best around the new boundary (the \ncentre of blue or green), reversing the original pattern. That is, discrimination across the \nnewly learned boundary was better than in the middle of the new categories: CP had been \nproduced by a few hours category training. \nEvidence from cross-cultural studies also supports the learning account of CP. Kay and \nKempton (1984) and Roberson, Davies and Davidoff (2000) found that CP only occurred if \nthe category boundaries were marked linguistically. This is consistent with language \naffecting perceptual colour categories, but it is also consistent with a simple direct language \naccount of CP. Further discussion is deferred until the direct language account has been \nconsidered more fully in the next section. \n \nThe direct language account of CP \nCP could be due to colour naming (e.g., Rosen & Howell, 1987). For instance, in a same-\ndifferent task, judging two stimuli to be different when they are physically different and \nnominally different (e.g., B1-G1) may be easier than judging that a within-category pair (B1-\nB2) are different because comparing names is sufficient to yield correct responses in the \ncross-category case, but is no use in the within-category case. Pilling et al. (2003) showed \nthat a simple model of name comparisons predicted accuracy for cross-category pairs very \nwell, but underestimated within-category accuracy for same-different and 2-AFC tasks. It is \n \n                                                                                                                 Categorical effects  7\nprobable that within-category judgements are based on comparing visual codes, whereas \ncross-category judgements may use name comparisons too. The latter is consistent with \nFujisaki and Kawashima\u2019s (1971) dual-code model. A stimulus can be represented in \nmemory at multiple levels of abstraction. The physical representation of the stimuli is useful \nwhen the task stimuli belong in the same category, while the stored symbolic representation \nis used for cross-category pairs. \nRoberson & Davidoff (2000) tested the direct language account of CP using a successive \n2-AFC-discrimination task following the usual logic outlined earlier. When the interval \nbetween target and test-stimulus (ISI) was unfilled, and when it contained visual interference, \nperformance was more accurate for the cross-category condition than for the within-category \ncondition (e.g. B1-G1 more accurate than B1-B2). However, with verbal interference in the \nISI, there was no difference between the two conditions. They concluded that CP was \neliminated because verbal interference prevented remembering of the target name. Pilling et \nal. (2003) replicated this result and showed that equivalent results were also found for \nsuccessive same-different tasks. Thus, there is strong evidence that CP may be a misnomer; it \nresults from labelling rather than from perceptual processes. \n \nCross-linguistic studies \nLanguages vary in how basic many colour terms they have, and in the positions of \ncategory boundaries (Berlin & Kay, 1969). When a language has relatively few colour terms, \nthese terms often cover all of colour space, and thus category sizes are larger than in \nlanguages such as English which has eleven basic colour terms (the maximum found \naccording to Berlin & Kay, 1969). For instance, in Otjihimba (one of the languages studied \nhere) red, pink, some orange and some purple are in one linguistic category (otji-serandu \n\u2018red\u2019) and blue and green are in another, otji-mburou \u2018blue-green\u2019. Comparing languages \n \n                                                                                                                 Categorical effects  8\nwith different categorical structures allows a test of the linguistic relativity hypothesis \n(Whorf, 1956). It also allows some insight into the origin of CP. If the distribution of CP does \nnot vary across languages, this would suggest that CP is due to universal perceptual \ncategories. On the other hand, if no CP is shown other than at a boundary marked by \nlanguage, this could be interpreted in different ways. CP may be a perceptual effect that \nemerges from language learning; or it could be the result of direct labelling.  Note that that \nboth the universal and relativist account of CP can be valid. CP could be innate, as the infant \nstudies suggest (e.g. Franklin & Davies, 2004), and later modified by language.   \nThe first cross-language studies, although not directly testing CP, seemed to suggest that \nperceptual structures were hardwired and universal (Heider, 1972; Heider & Olivier, 1972; \nRosch, 1973). The Dani have only two basic colour terms, but, for instance, remembered \nfocal examples of red, green, yellow and blue, better than non-focal examples, just as the \nEnglish speaking comparison group did. Rosch argued that the foci of Berlin & Kay\u2019s (1969) \nuniversal categories were perceptually salient universally. However, the findings from recent \nstudies of possible effects of language differences on perception and memory have suggested \nthat Rosch\u2019s strong universalist conclusions need to be qualified with a small relativist \ncomponent (Davies, 1998; Davies & Corbett, 1997, 1998; Davies, Sowden, Jerrett & Corbett, \n1998; Kay & Kempton, 1984; Pilling, 2001; Roberson, Davies & Davidoff, 2000). These \nstudies used a range of tasks for instance, 2-AFC discrimination, colour grouping (free-\nsorting by similarity), triads (\u2018which is the most different?\u2019) and recognition memory, but all \nfound broad cross-language similarities consistent with universalism, modulated by small \nlanguage-related differences, consistent with relativism. Equivalent results have also been \nfound in cross-language studies of children from 4-7 years of age (Boyles, 2001). \nTwo of the above studies investigated CP specifically. First, Kay and Kempton (1984) \ncompared speakers of Tarahumara (Mexico), whose language has a single term for blue and \n \n                                                                                                                 Categorical effects  9\ngreen, with English speakers, using a triads task. Three colours were presented and the one \nleast like the other two had to be chosen. The colours were either all blue or all green (within-\ncategory) or two blues and one green, or two greens and one blue. The Tarahumara were \nunaffected by which English category the colours were in, but the English speakers tended to \nchoose the nominal isolate on cross-category triads. According to Kay and Kempton, the \nTarahumara choices were based purely on perceptual separations, whereas the linguistic \ndifferences affected the English groups choices, albeit implicitly. \nRoberson, Davies & Davidoff (2000) compared speakers of Berinmo with English \nspeakers using a successive 2-AFC-discrimination task. Berinmo has no blue-green \nboundary, but its boundary for nol \u2018green\u2019 and wor \u2018yellow\u2019 is in a different position to the \nEnglish green-yellow boundary. Using the standard 2-AFC method for testing for CP, the \nEnglish showed CP for the blue-green boundary, but not for the nol-wor boundary, while the \nBerinmo showed the opposite pattern. Both studies of CP are inconsistent with a simple \nhardwired perceptual account of CP, but they are consistent with both the learned perceptual \naccount (stretching of cross-category distances make the nominal isolate the perceptual \nisolate as well) and the direct language account (the English use nominal differences when \navailable to guide choice). \n \nThe present study   \nNo simple answers to the questions about the origin and nature of CP emerge from the \nforegoing brief review. There is evidence that perceptual colour categories are hardwired \n(Bornstein et al., 1976; Franklin & Davies, 2004; Franklin, Pilling & Davies, 2005), that they \ncan be learned (\u00d6zgen & Davies, 2002), that CP is due to labelling (Roberson & Davidoff, \n2000) and that it is due to perceptual warping (Daoutis et al., 2005; Davies, Daoutis, Pilling \n& Wiggett, 2003; Kawai et al., 1995). Moreover, in most studies of CP, perceptual and direct \n \n                                                                                                                 Categorical effects  10\nlanguage accounts cannot be disentangled. In the present study we chose to extend the use of \nvisual search as a way of exploring CP. The task was to detect a colour target among a \nnumber of distractors that fell in the same or in a different linguistic category from the target. \nThe advantage of visual search is that when the target-distractor difference is on a single \nfeature, in this case colour, search is very efficient, and therefore the use of labelling is not \nnecessary.  In this case, the prime determinant of search performance is target-distractor \nsimilarity (Duncan & Humphreys, 1989). Thus, if target-distractor similarities are equated in \ndistances in colour space, and there is an advantage of a categorical difference between target \nand distractor, this would implicate perceptual processes, rather than labelling, as the origin \nof CP.  We could therefore claim that a simple feature visual search task should be driven by \nthe perceptual attributes of the stimuli, and should be unlikely to require labelling. \nWe present two cross-linguistic experiments which addressed the origin of CP.  In both \nexperiments, we compared native speakers of languages that differ in their categorical \nstructures of colour, on a visual search task. For example, the language of the Kwanyama \ntribe in Namibia (Experiment 1) has no basic colour terms for the English orange, purple or \npink, or for the English blue and green. These colours are included in large generic \ncategories; for instance pink is included in red, and there is a compound term for blue-green. \nSimilarly, the language of the Himba tribe in Namibia (Experiment 2) has a single linguistic \ncategory encompassing the English blue and green, and a single category for the English red \nand pink. The questions of interest were whether the speakers of different languages would \nperform differently on a perceptual task such as visual search, and whether their patterns of \nperformance would mirror their respective linguistic colour categories. In particular, we \nlooked for CP around English boundaries that are not present in either Namibian language. \nThis finding would provide converging evidence that CP develops through perceptual \nlearning, guided by language.  \n \n                                                                                                                 Categorical effects  11\nThe subjects were young children from each language group. This was done for several \nreasons. First, we wanted to know whether children, like adults, would show CP in search \ntasks. Second, it is common in rural Africa for people to be familiar with several languages, \nincluding, in our case, English and Afrikaans. Young children are much less likely to have \nbeen exposed to additional languages, and to be pure monolinguals. This should ensure that \nthe findings would not be confounded by the knowledge of foreign terms. We compared \nchildren from 4 to 7 years of age so that any changes in CP with age could be detected \n(Experiment 1). For instance, it could be that CP strengthens with linguistic competence. This \nmight be particularly prominent for our rural African samples where colour term learning \nmay not be complete until about 7 years of age (see e.g., Davies, Corbett, McGurk, & Jerrett, \n1994). \nThe experiments reported below used paper-and-pencil search tasks, suitable for \nfieldwork and for school visits. The children had to tick the colours that matched the target \ncolour in a search array, as fast and as accurately as they could. During search, the target was \nalways visible at the top of the search array; the children did not have to remember what the \ntarget was. The speeded nature and reduced memory load of the task further discouraged any \nuse of labelling (see Boyles, 2001). In addition, colour naming data were collected to \nexamine the relationship between linguistic categories and colour search performance. \n The colour stimuli were chosen to be perceptually equidistant within each condition. \nTo achieve this, we chose colours equidistant in CIE space. The CIE space (1976; see Hunt, \n1987) is a perceptually uniform space, intended to ensure that equal distances (\u2206E) between \ncolours correspond to equal discriminability. Although it should be noted that the CIELUV \nspace is not perfectly uniform, it still is the best candidate for use in colour research. \nMoreover, since the questions of interest focused on differences between language groups, \nany deviations from uniformity should affect both language groups in the same way.  \n \n                                                                                                                 Categorical effects  12\nAs mentioned earlier, both experiments reported here addressed the same main question: \nif two languages differ in the way they partition colour space, are these language differences \nmirrored in the performance on a perceptual task that is unlikely to require the direct use of \nlanguage? In addition, each experiment explored different questions related to the main \nissues. Experiment 1, as already mentioned, looked at age differences in naming and search \nperformance, to examine whether CP changes with age as a function of linguistic \ncompetence. Experiment 2 varied the number of distractors in the search task, to unravel \npossible differences in search efficiency between conditions in the two language groups. \nThese additional questions will be presented in more detail with respect to each experiment \nbelow. \n \nEXPERIMENT 1 \nExperiment 1 compared English speaking children with Kwanyama children. The \nKwanyama live in Ovamboland in Northern Namibia near the border with Angola. The \nKwanyama language has five basic colour terms: oshitoka \u2018white\u2019; oshilaula \u2018black\u2019; \noshitilyana \u2018red\u2019 (and some darker pinks and oranges); oshunga shei \u2018yellow\u2019 (and some \noranges) and oshitwima \u2018blue or green\u2019. Oshitwima is sometimes qualified by eulu \u2018sky\u2019 to \ndenote blue and omafo \u2018grass\u2019 to denote green. \nPossible category effects were investigated using a visual search task that varied the \ncategorical relationship of target and distractors at constant target to distractor perceptual CIE \ndistances. There was one type of target and one type of distractor. The task involved scanning \nan array of colours and marking targets as they were found. There were multiple targets to \nensure that search was long enough to be timed accurately. Targets and distractors were \neither from the same English category (within-category) or from different categories in \nEnglish (cross-category). Thus, for each region, one search array was cross-category for \n \n                                                                                                                 Categorical effects  13\nEnglish, but within-category for the Kwanyama: (e.g., B1 target among G1 distractors) and \none search array was within-category for both groups (e.g., B1 target among B2 distractors). \nCategorical perception was evidenced if cross-category arrays were completed faster or with \ngreater accuracy than within-category arrays. If colour terms warp perceptual colour space, \nthen, CP should be evident for the English children, but not for the Kwanyama children. CP \nshould be shown as faster or more accurate search when the search stimuli straddle category \nboundaries (e.g. B1-G1) than when they do not (e.g.B1-B2). \nThe colour terms described above are based on adult naming data and so a naming task \nwas included here to test children\u2019s colour term knowledge. For the naming task, the \nexperimental stimuli were presented individually and the child was asked to name the colour. \nThis information allowed us to examine our central question, namely, the relationship \nbetween colour language and performance on a colour perception task. In addition, \nExperiment 1 examined whether, and how, this relationship changes with age. As learning of \ncolour terms tends to occur later in rural African children, particularly those who have not \nbeen to school (Davies et al., 1994), it was likely that the younger children would not know \nall the colour terms. If this was the case, then it would be possible to test whether the size of \nthe category effect increased as colour term knowledge increased.  \nCategorical effects were tested in three regions of colour space: blue-purple, blue-green \nand red-pink. Whether or not there were absolute differences in search times among these \nregions was not directly pertinent to the current issues. It should be noted, however, that \nwhile the target to distractor perceptual distances were equated within a colour set, they were \nsmaller in the red-pink set than in the other two. Thus, as search should get harder as target-\ndistractor distances reduce (Duncan & Humphreys, 1989), search should be slowest for the \nred-pink set. This therefore provides a test of whether perceptual distance affects children\u2019s \nsearch as in adults. \n \n                                                                                                                 Categorical effects  14\nAbsolute differences between the two language groups were not directly relevant to the \ncurrent issues either. The two groups could differ in many irrelevant ways, such as facility in \nusing a felt tip pen. Rather, tests of the main questions would be provided by significant \ninteractions between language and category, category and age, and possibly by language \ncategory and age. The data analysis will therefore pay particular attention to these. \n \nMethod \nParticipants \nSixty-four English children and 45 Kwanyama children took part in the study. The age \nrange of the participants was 4 years to 7 years. In the Kwanyama sample there were 12 4-\nyear-olds, 9 5-year-olds, 12 6-year-olds, and 12 7-year-olds. For the English sample there \nwere 16 children in each age group. There were equal numbers of boys and girls in the \nEnglish sample, and 40% of the Kwanyama sample were male. The English participants were \nsampled from schools in Surrey, England and the Namibian participants were sampled from \nKwanyama speaking villages in rural Namibia. \n \nStimuli and Design \nVisual search. Each search array consisted of 48 circular colour patches, 2cm in diameter, \narranged in an equally spaced grid of 6 columns and 8 rows on an A4 sheet of card. At the \ntop centre of the page was a single target colour and there were 16 target circles, and 32 \ndistractor circles. Stimuli were produced by a Hewlett Packard colour proofer, and checked \nby a Minolta-CS-100 colorimeter. Table 1 gives the expected colour terms for each language \ngroup. Within a colour set, the perceptual distances in CIE (\u2206E) between adjacent pairs were \nequal. The perceptual distances of the stimulus pairs in CIE units (\u2206E) were 30 \u2206E for the \n \n                                                                                                                 Categorical effects  15\nblue-purple and blue-green sets and 20 \u2206E for the red-pink set. Therefore, the separation \nsizes for the red-pink set were smaller than for the other sets.   \nFor the English participants, the tasks were completed under lighting conditions that \napproximated natural daylight (colour temperature 6500\u00baK, at 810-1880 lux). For the \nNamibian participants the tasks were completed outside, not in direct sunlight or deep shade \n(colour temperature 5500 \u2013 7000\u00baK as indicated by a Gossen colormaster 3F). For the \nNamibian data, the experimenter was a student nurse at the University of Namibia, \nWindhoek. Her native language was Kwanyama, and the data were collected in and near to \nher home village. Training on the task procedure was provided and translations of the task \ninstructions were discussed to ensure that they were satisfactory. \nEach participant completed six search arrays, two for each colour set. One array was \nwithin-category (A, B) and one was cross-category (B, C). Category membership was defined \nby English adult naming.  There were two versions of each stimulus combination; one \nversion had, for instance, A as the target and B as the distractor, and the other version had B \nas the target and A as the distractor. Half of the participants in each language and age group \nwere given one version and the other half were given the other.  \nINSERT TABLE 1 HERE \nNaming task. Two cm2 coloured squares of each stimulus were mounted on 4cm2 squares \nof white coloured card. These were used for individual stimulus naming. \n \nProcedure \nVisual search task.  Each language group was tested by a native speaker of the \nappropriate language.  The English version of the instructions was: \u201cIn this game you have to \nfind all the dots that are the same colour as this dot at the top. So when I say \u2018go\u2019 can you \nmark all the dots that are the same colour as this dot at the top. When you have finished put \n \n                                                                                                                 Categorical effects  16\nyour pen in the empty circle on the bottom of the page. Do it as fast as you can.\u201d A practice \narray (green target, yellow distractors) was given first.  Once it was clear that the task was \nunderstood, the six experimental arrays were completed in a random order. The time taken \nfrom \u2018go\u2019 to pen in the finishing circle was measured with a stop-watch.  \nNaming task. After completing the visual search task, each stimulus was presented \nindividually, in random order, and had to be named. \n \nResults \nNaming \nTable 2 shows, for each language group, the terms given to each stimulus, and the \npercentage of the sample that used that term. The expected term is shown in bold. For the \nEnglish sample the majority term was 96\u2013100% consistent with the expected term, and thus, \nas intended, there was a linguistic boundary between stimuli B and C for each colour set. For \nthe Kwanyama there was lower agreement, with only 39\u201361% agreeing on the majority \ncolour term.  The pattern of naming for the Kwanyama was similar for each age group and \nthe frequency of \u2018I don\u2019t know\u2019 responses did not go down with age, F (3, 45) = 1.77, p =  \n0.17.  References to specific items were offered as names for the stimuli. For example, the \nwords ombidi (\u2018like traditional spinach\u2019) and omufyaati (\u2018leaves of the mopane trees\u2019) were \noffered for the stimuli from the blue-green and blue-purple sets, and the word olaole \n(\u2018earthworm\u2019) was offered for the stimuli from the red-pink set. The majority term for all the \nstimuli of the blue-green-and blue-purple sets, except C in blue-purple, was oshitwima. The \nmajority term for A and B of the pink-red set was oshitilyana. The low level of naming \nagreement meant that there was no clear name-name boundary for the blue-purple and pink-\nred sets. However, if \u2018I don\u2019t know\u2019 is treated as indicating non-membership in a category, \nthen there is higher consensus. Based on the majority response, there is a boundary between \n \n                                                                                                                 Categorical effects  17\nB and C for the blue-purple set (oshitwima, oshitwima, \u2018no name\u2019) and for the red-pink-set \n(oshitilyana, oshitilyana, \u2018no name\u2019) but there is no boundary for the blue-green set (all \noshitwima). \n \nINSERT TABLE 2 HERE \n \nVisual Search \nAs less than 1% errors were made by either language group, only search time was \nanalysed. Table 3 gives the mean times in seconds taken to complete each array. \n \nINSERT TABLE 3 HERE \n \nA four factor mixed effects ANOVA on category (cross-\/within), language \n(English\/Kwanyama), set (blue-purple\/blue-green\/pink-red) and age (4\/5\/6\/7 year-olds) was \nconducted on search times. Significant interactions involving language were explored with \nseparate ANOVAs for each language group. Other post-hoc tests were Bonferroni corrected t \ntests. \n \nMain effects \nAll main effects were significant. Within-category search was slower than cross-category \nsearch (means: 28.36 (9.5), 25.02 (8.8) secs respectively), F (1,101) = 57.62, p < .001. The \nEnglish group were slower than the Kwanyama group (means: 29.2 secs (8.72) and \n24.1(8.32) secs respectively), F (1,101) = 11.48, p < .001. Search times reduced with age \n(means: 31.1 (10.4), 32.1 (6.9), 26.0 (7.5), 20.0 (3.8) secs respectively), F (3,101) = 16.65, p \n< .001. There was no difference between 4- and 5-year-olds, but 5- and 6-year-olds and 6- \n \n                                                                                                                 Categorical effects  18\nand 7-year-olds both differed, (minimum t (54) = 2.98, p < .05). The colour set effect (F \n(2,202) = 20.11, p < .001) was due to the red-pink set (29.0 secs. (10.3)) being slower than \nboth the blue-green (25.4 secs. (9.4)) and the blue-purple set (25.6 secs. (9.4)), minimum t \n(108) = 4.87, p < .001. \n \nInteractions \nThere were also significant interactions between language and category (F (1,101) = \n22.85, p < .001), language and age (F (3,101) = 3.89, p < .05), language and set (F (2,202) = \n9.40, p < .001), category and set (F (2,202) = 8.32, p < .001), and category, set and language \n(F (6,202) = 5.01, p < .01). No further significant interactions were found (largest F = 1.24, \nsmallest p = 0.29). \nCategory by language interaction. Figure 2 shows the mean within- and cross-category \nsearch times for the Kwanyama and the English children. \n \nINSERT FIGURE 2 HERE \n             \nIt seems that the category effect was larger for English than for Kwanyama. This \nimpression was supported by ANOVAs on each language that showed a significant category \neffect for the English children, F (1, 60) = 87.9, p < .001, but not for the Kwanyama, F (1, \n41) = 3.69, p = 0.06.   \nLanguage by age interaction.  Figure 3 shows the mean search times for each age group, \nfor each language. \n \nINSERT FIGURE 3 HERE \n \n \n                                                                                                                 Categorical effects  19\nIt appears that the interaction is due to the difference between the two language groups \nvarying unsystematically with age.  Tests of simple main effects using ANOVAs for each \nlanguage group, show significant effects of age for both languages (minimum F = 7.06, \nlargest p < 0.01). However, consistent with the visual impression from Figure 3, the reason \nfor the language by age interaction was that the two languages did not differ in speed at the \nages of 5 and 7 years (maximum t = 0.84, p = 0.41, but did at 4 years (t (26) = 3.0, p < 0.01) \nand at 6 years (t (26) = 2.98, p < 0.01).    \nLanguage and set.  Figure 4 shows the mean search times for each set, for each language \ngroup. \nINSERT FIGURE 4 HERE \n \nIt appears that the difference between the two language groups is particularly marked for \nthe red-pink set. This was supported by separate ANOVAs for each group that showed a \nsignificant set effect for English, F (2, 60) = 29.5, p < .001, but not for the Kwanyama, F (2, \n41) = 2.07, p = 0.13. For English, the red-pink set was slower than both the other sets \n(minimum t (63) =5.70, p <.001) and there was no other difference2. \nCategory by language by set interaction.  Figure 5 shows the mean within- and cross-\ncategory search times for the English children (a) and the Kwanyama children (b) for each \nset. \n \nINSERT FIGURE 5 (5a AND 5b) HERE \n \nComparison of the two sets of data suggests that the category effect is particularly marked \nfor the red-pink set for the English children. This impression was supported by the separate \nlanguage ANOVAs which showed a significant interaction between category  and set for the \n \n                                                                                                                 Categorical effects  20\nEnglish children, F (2,120) = 12.38, p < .001, but not for the Kwanyama children, (F = 1.80, \np = 0.17). Direct comparisons of the difference between within-category and cross-category \nconditions between the three sets showed that for the English children the red-pink category \neffect was significantly larger than the blue-purple (t (63) = 4.11, p < .001) and the blue-\ngreen set (t (63) = 4.29, p < .001). This may be because of differences in discriminability \nacross sets. It is possible, for example, that the size of the category effect was masked by \nceiling performance (floor search times) in the blue-green and blue-purple sets, while the \ngreater perceptual difficulty in the red-pink set made the category effect more pronounced.  \n \nEffects of naming on search \nIf the category effect in the English children was due to naming, then the Kwanyama who \nshowed the same pattern of naming as the English should show a category effect too. The \nsize of the category effect was investigated for those Kwanyama children who gave the \nwithin-category stimuli the same name and the cross-category stimuli different names when \n\u2018no name\u2019 responses were treated as a distinct label. There were 15 children showing this \npattern of naming for the blue-purple boundary, 10 for the blue-green boundary and 17 for \nthe pink-red boundary. Table 4 gives the mean search times for these children for within- and \ncross-category arrays. \n \nINSERT TABLE 4 HERE \n \nPaired comparison t tests revealed no significant category effect for these children on any \nset: blue-purple, t (14) = 1.84, p = 0.09; blue-green, t (13) = 0.95, p = 0.36; pink-red, t (15) = \n0.96, p = 0.35. \n \n \n                                                                                                                 Categorical effects  21\nDiscussion of Experiment 1 \nThe findings of interest in Experiment 1 are outlined here. First, both language groups \ncould perform the task very accurately, and search speed increased with age. Second, the \nEnglish children were sensitive to the perceptual discriminability between sets. They were \nslower when the perceptual distance between the colours was smaller (pink-red set: 20 \u2206E), \nthan when the perceptual distance was larger (blue-green and blue-purple sets: 30 \u2206E). This \ndifference in performance between colour sets was absent in the Kwanyama. Third, and \nperhaps most importantly, cross-category search was faster than within category search in the \nEnglish group, but this advantage was absent in the Kwanyama. The category advantage in \nthe English group was consistent with the presence of a linguistic boundary in the blue-green, \nblue-purple, and red-pink sets. The absence of the effect in the Kwanyama also was \nconsistent with the absence of a name-name boundary. The Kwanyama children who had a \nname-\u2018I don\u2019t know\u2019 boundary did not show the category effect.  \nAs highlighted earlier, the search task was chosen on the assumption that it is driven \nprimarily by the discriminability between the stimuli and does not require labelling. If this is \nindeed the case, then our results are consistent with the perceptual warping account of CP. \nLearning names for the categories could lead to cross-category stretching of colour space and \nthus increased discriminability between stimuli that cross the category boundary; or, most in \naccordance with the evidence from infant studies, the ability to perceive categorically, \nalready present at birth, could be enhanced or attenuated by the presence or absence of a \nlinguistic boundary. Thus, having the linguistic boundary should lead to faster search in the \ncross-category conditions (Duncan & Humphreys, 1989); the absence of the linguistic \nboundary, on the other hand, should be reflected in no category advantage. \nThis conclusion, however, may be weakened by those Kwanyama children with a name-\n\u2018I don\u2019t know\u2019 boundary who did not show CP. If we assume that a name-\u2018I don\u2019t know\u2019 \n \n                                                                                                                 Categorical effects  22\nboundary in the Kwanyama is equivalent to a name-name boundary in English, then it is \nunclear why the Kwanyama did not show a category effect, as the English group did. \nAlternatively, it is possible that a name-\u2018I don\u2019t know\u2019 boundary is not adequate to produce \nperceptual change. The stimulus that cannot be named may still share many features with the \nnamed stimulus. This, in turn, may reduce the likelihood of perceptual stretching around the \ntwo stimuli and hence the possibility of a category effect. Thus, we can only claim \nrelationships between language and perception in the Kwanyama if we treat the name-\u2018I don\u2019t \nknow\u2019 boundary as a case of no boundary. For this reason, claims for a correspondence \nbetween linguistic categories and perceptual performance should be treated with caution in \nthe Kwanyama. To draw more confident conclusions, it would be necessary to include a \ncondition with a name-name boundary in our African group. If we were able to show CP in \nthis case, then we could make stronger claims about perceptual warping. \nAlthough, as already noted, the visual search task should not require or encourage \nlabelling, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that the category effect shown in the \nEnglish group were due, not to perceptual warping, but to the use of a direct naming strategy.  \nIf the children name the target and then search for stimuli with the same name, this could \nfacilitate cross-category search, but not within-category search.  The English search times are \nequivalent to about 600ms per stimulus, which is probably too fast for all the stimuli to be \nnamed.  If the English were using a naming strategy, whereas the Kwanyama relied more on \nthe perceptual attributes of the stimuli, this might also explain why the English were slower \nthan the Kwanyama.  \nIn short, Experiment 1 provided evidence for a category effect in the English, but not the \nKwanyama group. In the English group, the presence and size of the category effect was \nconsistent with naming patterns, as well as with discriminability between the stimuli. In the \nKwanyama group, the absence of a category effect was consistent with the lack of a name-\n \n                                                                                                                 Categorical effects  23\nname boundary. These results taken together support a relationship between language and \nperformance on the colour search task; and more specifically, suggest equivalence between \nnaming patterns and evidence for perceptual warping. However, this conclusion would be \nstronger if it were supported by a category effect around a name-name boundary in the \nKwanyama. One of our future aims should be to identify a linguistic boundary in this group, \nwhile keeping the perceptual distances within the desired range for the search task. \nAs will be seen, Experiment 2 approached the same question of the relationship between \ncolour naming and search performance in another African tribe, the Himba. Although the \ncentral question was the same, Experiment 2 addressed further questions related to the nature \nof CP; it also attempted to identify a name-name boundary for the African group.  \n \nEXPERIMENT 2 \nAs in Experiment 1, our main question in Experiment 2 related to potential differences in \ncolour search performance between two language groups that partition the colour space \ndifferently. To address this, we compared an English group and a Himba group from the \nHimba tribe in Northern Namibia, on a colour search task.  The Himba language, Otjihimba, \nhas five basic colour terms: otjivapa (white), otjizoozu (black), otjiserandu, (red, orange and \npink), otjidumbu (yellow), and otjimburou (blue, green, and some purples). It also has a less \nfrequent number of secondary terms and a limited number of borrowed terms, namely \notjingirine (green) and otjipinke (pink). As there is a single term for blue and green, \notjimburou, it was predicted that, if colour naming affects colour perception, search for a blue \n(B) target among green (G) distractors, and vice versa, would be faster and more accurate \nthan search of a B1 target among B2 distractors or a G1 target among G2 distractors. This \neffect, however, would be present only in the English group that has distinct linguistic \ncategories for blue and green. For the Himba group, all these search conditions should be \n \n                                                                                                                 Categorical effects  24\nwithin-category, and thus no category effect should be expected. This main prediction was \ntherefore the same as our hypotheses in Experiment 1. If the findings of Experiment 1 are \nrobust, then, despite small differences in the samples and methods, the results should be \nreplicated in Experiment 2. \nExperiment 2 addressed some further issues. As mentioned in the Discussion of \nExperiment 1, to make a strong claim that colour language is related to colour perception, we \nshould be able to show a category effect with a name-name boundary and the absence of the \neffect when there is no boundary, within the same language group. One of our aims was \ntherefore to use colours that crossed a linguistic boundary in Otjihimba.  To achieve this, we \nincluded a green-yellow set for which the Himba were likely to have separate terms, possibly \notjimburou and otjindumbu. It should be noted, however, that to achieve the desired \nperceptual distance between targets and distractors (see below) we had to choose light greens \nthat were not likely to be best category examples, and for which we had no previous naming \ndata. For this reason we were not sure whether this set would really include a linguistic \nboundary for the Himba; its choice was only tentative. \nThe search task used here was slightly more demanding than the one used in Experiment \n1. There were two types of distractor instead of one. The distractors were always from the \nsame category, as defined by English adult naming. For example, a blue-green search meant \nthat the target was blue (B) and the distractors were either green1 (G1) or green2 (G2).  In \naddition, target-distractor distance was about 20 \u2206\u0395 (see Nagy & Sanchez, 1990), a distance \ncomparable to the red-pink set in Experiment 1. The two types of distractor and the relatively \nsmall perceptual distances meant that the children were likely to make errors, which would \nprovide an additional measure of search performance for our analysis. Making the task more \ndifficult also helped avoiding ceiling performance, allowing category effects to emerge.  \n \n                                                                                                                 Categorical effects  25\nA final question related to search efficiency, as indicated by the effects of set size on the \nsearch times. The number of targets was fixed, but the number of distractors was varied. \nThus, the target to distractor ratio was manipulated. We had two different conditions with a \n1:4 and 1:7 target:distractor ratio, respectively. This provided, not only an additional measure \nof search efficiency, but also possibly some insight into how the children performed the task. \nIf the search time was not affected by the number of distractors, the search slopes would be \nflat. Flat slopes, in turn, should mean very efficient search (see Wolfe, 1998), and would \npossibly suggest that the task was stimulus-driven (Wolfe, 2003).  If, conversely, the number \nof distractors did affect performance, this should indicate top-down control of the search (e.g. \nvisual comparisons).  \nWe therefore addressed the following questions. First, would the number of distractors in \nthe search array affect the two language groups differently, implying that the two groups of \nchildren performed the task in different ways? Second, would the effect of set size vary \ndepending on the search condition? More specifically, we wanted to see whether cross-\ncategory search would be more efficient, with flatter slopes, than within category search.  \n In short, Experiment 2 addressed the same main question as Experiment 1, namely the \nrole of linguistic boundaries in the categorical perception of colour. Of interest were the \npotential cross-language differences in category effects. Search for a target that crosses a \nname-name boundary with the distractors should be faster, more accurate and overall more \nefficient than search where the target and distractors had the same name.  If we were \nsuccessful in finding stimuli that crossed a linguistic boundary in the Himba, this group \nshould be able to show this category advantage around the name-name boundary. This would \nfurther strengthen the suggested relationship between language and colour perception. \n \n                                                                                                                 Categorical effects  26\n \nMethod \nParticipants \nThirty-two 6- and 7-year-old English children, 12 boys and 20 girls, were recruited from \nlocal primary schools in Surrey. Thirty-two Himba children, 14 boys and 18 girls, with \nestimated ages of 6 and 7, were recruited from seven different Himba villages in the \nKaokoveld region of Northern Namibia. The children received little or no schooling: 40 % of \nthe children had never been to school; around 10% had only just started school; and the \nremaining 50% had been to school for 18 months on average (range: 12 to 30 months).  \n \nStimuli and Design \nThe search arrays took the same form as in Experiment 1, except two types of distractor \nwere used and the particular stimuli differed. There were 12 stimuli for the experimental \narrays, 6 for each boundary condition: blue1-blue2-blue3-green1-green2-green3 (blue-green \nset) and lightgreen3-lightgreen2-lightgreen1-yellow3-yellow2-yellow1 (light green-yellow \nset), as defined by adult English naming. Table 5 shows the perceptual distances, \u2206E, \nbetween the stimuli. As can be seen, within each set  the perceptual distance between \nadjacent colours was approximately 20 \u2206E. The target was always adjacent to the category \nboundary and the distractors were either the two remaining colours in the category for within-\ncategory conditions (e.g., green1 amongst green2 and green3) or in the cross-category \nconditions, the two colours nearest to the target across the boundary served as distractors \n(e.g., green1 amongst blue1 and blue2); see Figure 1. There was also a practice condition \nconsisting of yellow targets among green and red distractors. In the practice condition, the \nperceptual distances between the colours were over 100 \u2206E units. The yellow and green \nstimuli in this condition were very different, and much more discriminable, than the stimuli \n \n                                                                                                                 Categorical effects  27\nused in the lightgreen-yellow conditions. \n \nINSERT TABLE 5 HERE \n \nThere were two set sizes: 30 and 48 stimuli. In both set sizes, there were 6 instances of \nthe target. For size 48, there were 42 distractors (21 instances for each type of distractor); for \nsize 30, there were 24 distractors (12 instances for each type of distractors). Note that the \nnumber of targets remained fixed: what changed was the target\/distractor ratio. For set size \n30, stimulus locations were randomly selected in the grid, leaving the remaining space blank. \nFor set size 48, stimuli were present in all locations in the grid. The location of targets and \ndistractors in the matrix was random. \nThere were 8 search arrays made up from each combination of 2 colour-boundaries (blue-\ngreen or yellow-green), 2 category conditions (within\/cross-) and 2 display sizes (30 or 48). \nTwo-cm2 coloured squares of each stimulus were used for individual stimulus naming. \n \nProcedure \nEach participant did the practice condition followed by 8 experimental arrays, and then \nthe naming task. Half of the children searched for a blue target among (a) blue distractors \n(within category; B1 among B2 and B3; see Figure 1) and (b) green distractors (cross-\ncategory; B1 among G1 and G2; see Figure 1). This group of children also searched for a \nlight green target among (a) light green distractors (within category; LG1 among LG2 and \nLG3) and (b) yellow distractors (cross-category; LG1 among Y1 and Y2). The other half of \nthe children searched for a green target among (a) green distractors (within category; G1 \namong G2 and G3) and (b) blue distractors (cross-category (G1 among B1 and B2), and for a \nyellow target among (a) yellow distractors (within category; Y1 among Y2 and Y3) and (b) \n \n                                                                                                                 Categorical effects  28\nlight green distractors (cross-category; Y1 among LG1 and LG2).  Thus, within a set, the \ntarget was always the same for cross- and within-category search.  \nThe order of the display size condition was counterbalanced, and within each display \nsize, the order of the 4 arrays was randomised.  \nThe testing procedure was the same as in Experiment 1. \n \nResults  \nNaming \nTable 6 shows the name frequencies for each stimulus in each language group. As can be \nseen, the English group named the stimuli with high agreement. However, the pattern was \nless clear for the Himba. The majority term for the blue stimuli was otjimburou (56 to 72%); \nhowever, naming of the green colours varied: the dominant term was otjimburou (48%) for \nthe boundary green colour, but the dominant term for the other two greens was otjingirine \n(44% in both cases; this is a loan term from English green); this term competed with \notjimburou (32-40%). Naming of the green-yellow set was not according to prediction in the \nHimba: all the stimuli in that group had the dominant term otjindumbu, except where \notjindumbu (32%) competed with otjingirine (36%). Use of other terms and I don\u2019t know \nresponses were relatively low. It appears that there was no clear name boundary for the blue-\ngreen region (as intended), but nor was there one for the green-yellow set. This was \nsupported by inspection of individual naming patterns. Only two children had a linguistic \nboundary for blue and green; only one child had the boundary for the green and yellow \nstimuli. In short, for all stimuli used, English children had name-name boundaries for both \nBlue-Green and Lightgreen-Yellow, while Himba children did not. Naming did not appear to \nvary systematically with the amount of schooling. \n \n \n                                                                                                                 Categorical effects  29\nINSERT TABLE 6 HERE \n \nSearch \nAccuracy was not at ceiling, therefore search time and accuracy were analysed. Accuracy \nwas expressed as A', a non-parametric equivalent of d' (Donaldson, 1993; Pollack & Norman, \n1964), which combines hits and false positives into a bias free index of accuracy. Seven \nHimba children had search times more than 1.96 standard deviations above the mean. In the \nanalysis reported below, these children were excluded from the sample as outliers. However, \nit should be noted that the directions of the means were the same both when they were \nincluded and when they were removed from the analysis. This left 25 Himba children and 32 \nEnglish children. The means and standard errors in the search times of the Himba and \nEnglish samples are shown in Figures 6a and 6b. Figures 7a and 7b show the mean accuracy \n(+\/- 1 S. E.) for each condition for the Himba and English samples. \n \nINSERT FIGURE 6 (6a AND 6b) AND FIGURE 7 (7a AND 7b) HERE \n \nThe two groups did not meet the homogeneity of variance assumption (Levene\u2019s test p < \n0.05 for most conditions), even after the data were transformed; therefore separate analysis \nwas required for each language group. Three-factor (display size (30, 48) by category \n(within, cross-) by colour region (blue-green, green-yellow) repeated measures ANOVAS on \ntime and accuracy were used separately for each language group. \nMain effects. \nCategory. In the Himba, the main effect of category was not significant for search time (p \n> 0.9, nor for accuracy (p > 0.3); also see Figures 6a and 7a. Within-category and cross-\ncategory performance were not significantly different (means: within-category time = 38.45, \n \n                                                                                                                 Categorical effects  30\nSD = 13.1, cross-category time = 38.29, SD = 12.4; within-category accuracy = 0.89, SD = \n0.01, cross-category accuracy = 0.88, SD = 0.01).  \nIn the English children, however, the effect of category was significant, F (1, 31) = 74.65, \np < 0.001 for time, and F (1, 31) = 15.94, p < 0.001 for accuracy. Thus, the English children  \nwere both faster and more accurate in the cross-category conditions than in within-category \nconditions (means: within-category time = 33.05, SD = 6.96; cross-category time = 25.09, SD \n= 5.55; within-category accuracy = 0.91, SD = 0.06; cross-category accuracy = 0.96, SD = \n0.06; see Figures 6b and 7b).  \nColour set. The effect of colour set was significant in both language groups. Main effects \nof colour set on time:  F (1, 24) = 19.46, p < 0.001 for the Himba; F (1, 31) = 24.27, p < \n0.001 for the English. Main effects of colour set on accuracy: F (1, 24) = 9.18, p < 0.01 for \nthe Himba; F (1, 31) = 7.08, p < 0.05 for the English. Inspection of the means (also see \ngraphs 6a and 6b, 7a and 7b) suggests that both language groups were slower and less \naccurate in the blue-green set than in the green-yellow set (Himba means: blue-green time = \n43.52, SD = 15.05; green-yellow time = 33.22, SD = 10.8; blue-green accuracy = 0.84, SD = \n0.15; green-yellow accuracy = 0.93, SD = 0.01. English means: blue-green time = 34.80, SD \n= 10.58; green-yellow time = 23.33, SD = 6.34; blue-green accuracy = 0.91, SD = 0.06; \ngreen-yellow accuracy = 0.96, SD = 0.06).  \nSet size. There was no significant main effect of set size for the Himba. In the English \ngroup the effect was significant, F (1, 31) = 30.45, p < 0.001 for time; F (1, 31) = 5.13, p < \n0.05 for accuracy. From Figures 7a and 7b it can be seen that, in the Himba, search time \nseems unaffected by the number of distractors, yielding flat search slopes (means: small set \nsize time = 37.11, SD = 11.95; large set size time = 39.62, SD = 13.9; small set size accuracy \n= 0.89, SD = 0.1; large set size accuracy = 0.89, SD = 0.1).  \n \n                                                                                                                 Categorical effects  31\nEnglish children, conversely, were slower when there were more distractors in the display \n(means: small set size time = 25.57, SD = 6.57; large set size time = 32.56, SD = 6.91; small \nset size accuracy = 0.92, SD = 0.06; large set size accuracy = 0.95, SD = 0.06).  \n \nInteractions \nNo interactions were significant for time or accuracy for the Himba. In the English group \nthere were two significant interactions related to search time: category and colour set, F (1, \n31) = 20.15, p < 0.001; colour set and set size, F (1, 31) = 9.42, p < 0.01.  \nEnglish search time: category by colour interaction. The category effect was larger for \nthe yellow-green set than for the blue green set (means of within-cross-category difference, \naveraged for both set sizes: blue-green = 3.37, green-yellow = 12.55; also see Figure 6b). \nThis was confirmed by comparing the sizes of the category effect for each colour region in \nthe English group, t (31) = 4.49, p < 0.001.  \nSearch time: colour by set size interaction. Inspection of Figure 6b suggests that search \nslopes were relatively flat in the green-yellow condition, but steeper in the blue-green \ncondition. To test this, slopes for blue-green and green-yellow were calculated (mean slopes, \naveraged for cross- and within-category conditions: blue-green = 5.19, green-yellow = 1.80). \nIt was confirmed that slopes for green-yellow were significantly smaller than slopes for blue-\ngreen, t (31) = 3.07, p < 0.01. \nAs can be seen, overall the analyses of accuracy and search times were very similar; \naccuracy results supported the patterns found for search times. The findings cannot be \nattributed to speed-accuracy trade-off. When the analysis was repeated on search time, with \naccuracy as a covariate, the same patterns of results were found.  \nIt should be noted that the pattern of results in the Himba did not vary systematically with \nthe amount of schooling. \n \n                                                                                                                 Categorical effects  32\n \nDiscussion of Experiment 2 \nA common finding in both language groups was that search was faster and more accurate \nin the green-yellow than the blue-green set. However, there was a number of results specific \nto the language groups; these are outlined here.  \n       First, the English group showed a significant category advantage, but the Himba did not. \nCross-category search was faster and more accurate than within category search, but this \nadvantage was only present in the English group. The category advantage in the English \ngroup was significantly larger in the green- yellow set than in the blue-green set.  \nSecond, the English children were slower when the array size was larger, while the \nperformance of the Himba did not appear to depend on set size. In the English group, search \nslopes were considerably flatter (more efficient search) in the green-yellow set than the blue-\ngreen set. Third, in the Himba, these patterns of results did not depend on naming, or time \nspent in school. In the English group, the presence of the category advantage was consistent \nwith the presence of a linguistic boundary. \nOne of the aims of Experiment 2 was to find a name-name boundary in the Himba. In this \nway, a within- and a cross-category condition could be compared directly within the same \nlanguage group. We used blue-green stimuli, for which the English had a linguistic boundary \nbut the Himba did not, and green-yellow stimuli, which were intended to have a name-name \nboundary in both the English and the Himba. However, this was not the case for the Himba. \nAll the stimuli in the LightGreen-Yellow set, with the exception of LightGreen3, were given \nthe single name otjindumbu. As already noted, for these stimuli to be within a required range \nof perceptual distance, the greens had to be light. Thus the mburou-ndumbu boundary in the \nHimba was missed. \n \n                                                                                                                 Categorical effects  33\nBesides missing a name-name boundary in the Himba, which would strengthen our \nconclusions, the findings of Experiment 2 are, at first glance, straightforward. In the English \ngroup, there was a category effect for both blue and green and green and yellow. The \ncategory effect was absent in the Himba. This agrees with the naming patterns: the language \ngroup that had a linguistic boundary for these colours performed the search categorically; the \ngroup that grouped the colours under a single name did not. \nIn both language groups, performance was better in the green-yellow set than in the blue-\ngreen set, even though the perceptual distances in CIE were equated. This suggests a \ndifference in discriminability between the two sets. Since we were interested in the cross-\nlanguage comparisons, and this difference in discriminability affected both groups in the \nsame way, this finding does not alter our conclusions. However, it is less clear why the \ncategory effect in the English group was more pronounced in the green-yellow set. If naming \nwas the only factor determining CP, then we should not expect differences in the size of the \ncategory effect between colour sets. Instead, it seems that some characteristic of the cross-\ncategory green-yellow stimuli enhanced detection of the target in the English group, and thus \nenhanced the category effect.  \nOn the basis of the search slopes, there is evidence for top-down search in the English \ngroup. The significant effects of set size in this group suggest that the search was performed \nin a way that was, at least partly, dependent on the number of distractors. The children may \nhave matched the stimuli of the array with the target template, a process that may or may not \ninvolve direct labelling. It is possible, though not directly testable here, that the green-yellow \ncross-category stimuli benefited more from this top-down guidance: a green target among \nyellow distractors , for example, was more salient on the basis of two features: \u2018green\u2019 and \n\u2018dark\u2019, as opposed to one feature: \u2018blue\u2019 in the blue-greens set. \n \n                                                                                                                 Categorical effects  34\nOverall, Experiment 2 reported the presence of a category effect in a group with name-\nname boundary (English group) and the absence of the category effect in a group with no \nlinguistic boundary (Himba). This finding supports and replicates the results of Experiment 1 \nwith a different language group. This pattern of results could be interpreted as perceptual \nwarping around a linguistic boundary. However, the effects of set size in the English group \nand the absence of these effects in the Himba group also suggested that the two language \ngroups performed the task in different ways. It could be argued, therefore, that the category \neffects shown in the English group are a result of top-down guidance, where labelling of the \nsearch stimuli may play a role.  \n \nGENERAL DISCUSSION \nThe experiments reported here investigated the category effect in visual search in \nchildren. They further examined the nature of the category effect, namely the involvement of \nnative language in performance on a perceptual task. If language shapes our perceptual \ncategory boundaries, then whether we perceive stimuli categorically or not depends on the \nlinguistic boundaries we possess for these stimuli. This would be supported by cross-\nlanguage differences in category effects, accompanied by analogous differences in linguistic \ncategorisation.  \nThe main finding of both experiments reported here was the presence of a category effect \nin visual search. When the target and distractors belonged in different categories, search \nperformance was considerably better. There is little evidence in the literature for category \neffects in colour search in adults (Daoutis et al., 2005; Franklin et al., 2004; Kawai et al., \n1995); here we demonstrated them in children.  \nLess clear was the locus of the category effect, and the way in which language is related \nto category search. Experiment 1 demonstrated a category effect in English children, who \n \n                                                                                                                 Categorical effects  35\nhave the equivalent linguistic boundaries, but not in Kwanyama children, who do not. \nHowever, a group of Kwanyama children with a name-\u2018I don\u2019t know\u2019 boundary did not show \na category effect. Thus, if the category effect is related to language, name-name boundaries \nmay be necessary. Although one of the aims of Experiment 2 was to include a name-name \nboundary for both language groups, it was not possible to find a boundary for the Himba. \nPossible correspondences between naming patterns and category effects in search remained, \ntherefore, partly inconclusive. The absence of linguistic boundaries (blue-green and green-\nyellow) in the Himba group was accompanied by absence of a category effect, whereas the \npresence of these linguistic boundaries in the English group was accompanied by the \npresence of a category effect. This pattern was also apparent in Kwanyama children in \nExperiment 1. However, relationships between naming and perceptual performance would be \nfurther strengthened if we showed category effects with a name-name boundary in the Himba \ngroup. \nEffects of set size provided some insight into the nature of the category effect. Language \nmay sharpen our perceptual boundaries, but it can also be involved in top-down guided \nsearch. As already mentioned, we chose visual search to reduce the possibility of using \nlinguistic strategies. The significant effects of set size in the English group, however, \nsuggested that the children performed a guided search that could involve the use of language. \nThis involvement of language could be in the form of explicit labelling: the stimuli should be \nbeneficial in cross-category search only, where the target is nominally distinct from the \ndistractors. Alternatively, and perhaps more in line with the search times reported here, the \nchildren may have performed the task by comparing the search items to the target. As the \ntarget was always present at the top of the array during search, it could serve a simultaneous \ncue (see Laarni, 2001). \n \n                                                                                                                 Categorical effects  36\nIn short, here we demonstrated that children can be aided by the category status of stimuli \nwhen performing visual search: when the target and distractors belong in different colour \ncategories, search is more efficient. Moreover, this categorical advantage disappears if the \ntarget and distractors are not separated by a linguistic boundary. Naming patterns seem to \nagree with performance but, since there is evidence for top-down guidance, a labelling  \nstrategy cannot be dismissed.  \nThe present paper provided some important findings on children\u2019s visual search, and \nsome insight into the nature of the category effect. Even in a simple search task we found \nevidence suggesting a relationship between colour language and perception. We also \npresented some evidence of how the children might perform the task. Further work should \naim at replicating these findings by looking at name-name boundaries in both languages \nbeing compared. It is also important to examine more closely the contribution of top-down \nguidance in children\u2019s visual search. Strong claims of perceptual warping induced by \nlanguage would only be justified by showing a clear correspondence between naming \npatterns and performance on a task where top-down involvement is minimal. The present \nstudy was a first step towards addressing this issue.  \n \n \n                                                                                                                 Categorical effects  37\nAuthor note \nChristine A.

Munsell is a colour system standardised to produce perceptually equal steps. Munsell \ncolours vary along three dimensions: hue, value (lightness), and chroma. Equal sized steps \nalong a single dimension result in equal perceptual differences. Similarly, CIE (1976) is a \nperceptually uniform colour space, rather like the classical colour circle or colour solid if \nlightness is included. The CIE dimensions are L* (lightness) u* (roughly the red-green axis), \nand v* (the blue-yellow axis). Chroma and saturation increase with distance from the origin \n(grey). Perceptual distances are given by the Euclidean distance in the space (\u2206\u0395). \n2. The red-pink stimulus separation sizes were 10 \u2206E units less than the blue-green and blue-\npurple. Therefore, if \u2206E contributes to search speed, we would expect search to be slower for \nthe red-pink set. This is the case for the English times but not the Kwanyama. It is unclear \nwhy there is no difference in search time across sets for the Kwanyama.  \n \n                                                                                                                 Categorical effects  43\nTable 1.

Cross- and within-category stimuli used to demonstrate CP. The six stimuli (G3, \nG2, G1, B1, B2, B3) are equidistant in colour space. The category boundary lies between G1 \nand B1. Discrimination is better between G1 and B1 (cross-category pair) than between B1 \nand B2 (within-category pair), yet the G1-B1 and B1-B2 perceptual distances are the same. \nFigure 2.
