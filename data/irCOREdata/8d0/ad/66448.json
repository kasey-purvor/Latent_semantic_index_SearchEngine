S. Ramachandran and colleagues at a conference of the Society\nfor Neuroscience in October 1997, the alleged discovery of a \u2018God-spot\u2019 or\n\u2018God-module\u2019 in the brain has received much media attention, largely due\nto its potential ramifications for our understanding of religious belief.1 In this\nessay, I will begin by briefly outlining what Ramachandran\u2019s study2 purports\nto show. I will then examine its possible implications for the claim that God\nreally does communicate with people during religious experiences. Contrary to\nRamachandran\u2019s own view, I will argue that an in-principle agnosticism is not a\nsustainable position to adopt in relation to this claim. A refusal to entertain the\npossibility that God speaks to people during religious experiences as an aspect of\nReligious Studies 39, 323\u2013345 f 2003 Cambridge University Press\nDOI: 10.1017\/S0034412503006413 Printed in the United Kingdom\n323\nscientific deliberation does not amount to neutrality. In fact, it ultimately entails\nan ontological rather than merely methodological position, a position that\nimplicitly rules out the possibility of certain coherent, theistic ontological claims.\nHence, my purpose here is not to decide whether such studies do or do not\nconstitute evidence that religious experiences have veridical objects but rather\nto employ them as a specific illustration of how a supposedly neutral method-\nological standpoint can commit one to an ontological position antagonistic to a\nsubstantial body of religious beliefs. My argument complements concerns voiced\nby Alvin Plantinga on a number of occasions (e.g. 1991\/1998) to the effect that\nmethodological exclusion of theistic claims in science often amounts to an\nunwarranted ontological exclusion.\nI will conclude by illustrating that the plausibility of claims such as there are\nneurological structures for communicating with God cannot be weighed up in\na wholly empirical fashion. This is because pre-existent ontological commit-\nments, whether theistic or atheistic, serve as backdrops for the interpretation and\neven individuation of biological structures, differently determining the kinds of\nbiological entities whose being one is prepared to acknowledge as a possibility.\nThus, if debate over the question is to be possible, it must involve an interplay\nbetween empirical and hermeneutic considerations.\nRamachandran on the neurology of religious experience\nIt has long been known that certain subjects affected by focal temporal-\nlobe epilepsy report profound religious feelings during seizures, feelings that may\npersist, with a lesser degree of intensity, after seizures have ceased.3 As Rama-\nchandran notes, subjects with seizures \u2018originating in this part of the brain can\nhave intense, spiritual experiences during the seizures and sometimes become\npreoccupied with religious and moral issues even during seizure-free or interictal\nperiods\u2019 (1998, 175).4 But how can one explain \u2018the flights of intense religious\necstasy experienced by patients with temporal lobe seizures or their claim that\nGod speaks directly to them?\u2019 (1998, 176). One might be tempted to dismiss such\nexperiences as a pathological effect or malfunction specific to a certain neuro-\nlogical condition. However, experiments carried out by Michael Persinger with a\ntranscranial magnetic stimulator (discussed by Ramachandran (1998, 174\u2013175))\ncast doubt upon this. Magnetic stimulation of parts of the brain can induce\nvarious psychological and behavioural effects, some of which are uniquely as-\nsociated with stimulation of quite specific brain areas, thus providing clues about\nthe possible localization of certain brain functions. When stimulating parts of his\ntemporal lobes, Persinger apparently \u2018found to his amazement that he experi-\nenced God for the first time in his life\u2019 (Ramachandran, 1998, 175). This possibility\nof producing similar psychological effects in subjects with no history of temporal-\nlobe seizures suggests that the capacity for these experiences is not restricted to\n324 MATTHEW RATCL I FFE\ncertain epileptics but is much more general or even universal, even though it is\nconsiderably more pronounced in some people. So it seems that there is a com-\nmon but variably active neurological structure involved in religious experience,\nwhose activity might be explained in a number of different ways.\nRamachandran (1998, 181\u2013182) entertains four possibilities :\n(1) God really does speak to people during focal temporal-lobe seizures.\n(2) Religious experiences are a misinterpretation or ad-hoc\nrationalization of emotional chaos.\n(3) Religious experiences are a result of general enhancement of neural\npathways between the limbic system and temporal lobe, resulting\nin patients imbuing everything with excessive significance.5\n(4) Specialized neural circuitry mediates specifically religious\nexperience.\nRamachandran dismisses (1) on the basis that it \u2018can be neither proved nor ruled\nout on empirical grounds\u2019 (1998, 182). He also dismisses (2), given that there are\nmyriad cases of emotional chaos that aren\u2019t interpreted religiously. Hence the\ntwo main contenders are (3) and (4). The media attention surrounding Rama-\nchandran et al.\u2019s 1997 presentation and 1998 report relates to the results of an\nexperiment set up to test the relative plausibility of these two explanations. Rama-\nchandran et al. measured galvanic skin responses of two temporal-lobe patients\nin order to monitor their emotional reactions to various words and icons, some\nwith strong religious associations, some mundane, and others non-religious but\ngenerally perceived as emotive. Hypothesis (3) predicts enhanced emotional\nreactions across the board. However, Ramachandran et al. found a selectively\nenhanced response only to religious words and icons in temporal-lobe patients.\nIn conjunction with this, compared with other subjects there was a diminished\nsensitivity to other emotive categories such as sexual imagery (see Ramachan-\ndran, 1998, 185\u2013188). Selective response to religious words and imagery rules out\n(3), leaving only (4). Hence Ramachandran states that \u2018the one clear conclusion\nthat emerges from all this is that there are circuits in the human brain that are\ninvolved in religious experience and that these become hyperactive in some\nepileptics\u2019 (1998, 188).\nIt is important to note that this is a very modest conclusion and fails to differ-\nentiate a number of more specific claims. For example, the involvement of\ncommon neurological structures does not entail that those structures have the\nfunction of sub-serving religious experience. Religious experience could just as\nwell be a malfunction or a contingent side effect of a different function with\nwhich these structures are involved. It is also by no means certain that the neural\npathways identified constitute a distinct and complete circuit, rather than a part\nof a larger system that cannot be fruitfully considered in isolation from that\nsystem.6 By analogy, a tennis player\u2019s hands make a major contribution to her\nThe neurology of religious experience 325\ntennis-playing ability, and their absence would probably put paid to her sporting\ncareer, but it would be a mistake to infer that the hands constitute a distinct\nand complete tennis system that can be studied in isolation from the rest of the\norganism. Furthermore, as Ramachandran (1998, 184) acknowledges, the exper-\nimental results do not imply that religious experience is in any illuminating sense\nbiological. Specific biological structures are involved in writing books, kicking\nballs, and smoking cigarettes but this does not imply that such pastimes are\nwritten into our biology. So Ramachandran\u2019s results are still a long way from\nsuggesting a \u2018God-module\u2019 ; that is, a discrete neurological structure whose\nfunction is to produce or mediate religious experience.\nHence, a pressing goal for future research is to assess the many competing\nhypotheses that remain viable. However, Ramachandran explicitly states that one\nhypothesis not up for scientific debate is (1) that God really does speak to people\nduring temporal-lobe seizures. He claims that \u2018this can be neither proved nor\nruled out on empirical grounds\u2019 (1998, 182), and maintains that \u2018my goal as a\nscientist \u2026 is to discover how and why religious sentiments originate in the brain,\nbut this has no bearing one way or the other on whether God really exists or not\u2019\n(1998, 185). Hence, the position advocated in respect of the theistic hypothesis is\none of religious neutrality. Theistic claims are, it seems, excluded by definition\nfrom the scope of science, which can investigate the brain structures involved in\nreligious experience without prejudicing one way or the other the claim that God\nreally interacts with people during religious experiences.\nPlantinga (e.g. 1991\/1998, 1997) claims that this sort of methodological natural-\nism often, though not always, involves a kind of ontological commitment, a\nprovisional atheism rather than religious neutrality :\nWe are sometimes told that natural science is natural science. So far it is hard to\nobject: but how shall we take the term \u2018natural\u2019 here? It could mean that natural\nscience is science devoted to the study of nature. Fair enough. But it is also taken to\nmean that natural science involves a methodological naturalism or provisional\natheism: no hypothesis according to which God has done this or that can qualify as\na scientific hypothesis. (1991\/1998, 693)\nAccording to Plantinga (1991\/1998, 694), methodological naturalism slides into a\n\u2018sober [atheistic] metaphysical truth\u2019 which is \u2018settled and fundamental \u2019.\nMcMullin argues in response to Plantinga, that \u2018methodological naturalism does\nnot restrict our study of nature; it just lays down which sort of study qualifies as\n\u2018\u2018scientific\u2019\u2019 \u2019 (1993\/1998, 702). He contends that scientific theorizing is simply not\nthe kind of activity that can entertain claims concerning God\u2019s agency, but that\nthis is just a methodological restriction that serves to determine the scope and\nlimits of science. In other words, the restriction is part of the definition of science\nand does not entail any ontological claims. Though specific scientific hypotheses\ncan come into conflict with religious doctrine, there is no sense in which meth-\nodological naturalism is itself a source of conflict. Science does not rule out\n326 MATTHEW RATCL I FFE\ntheistic claims a priori but leaves them outside its scope, to be legitimately\nentertained elsewhere:\nScientists have to proceed in this way; the methodology of natural science gives no\npurchase on the claim that a particular event or type of event is to be explained by\ninvoking God\u2019s \u2018special\u2019 action or by calling on the testimony of Scripture. Calling\nthis methodological naturalism is simply a way of drawing attention to the fact that\nit is a way of characterizing a particular methodology, no more. In particular, it is\nnot an ontological claim about what sort of agency is or is not possible. (Plantinga\n(1993\/1998, 702))\nRuse argues similarly that,\n\u2026 the metaphysical naturalist is the person who is an atheist, who does deny that there\nis anything beyond blind law working on inert matter. The methodological naturalist,\nwho may well be an ardent Darwinian, is one who states that for the purposes of doing\nscience nothing but law will be entertained, but who recognizes that there might be\nmore, in fact or meaning. (2001, 99)\nThe disagreement between Plantinga and McMullin is explicitly concerned\nwith the question of Darwinian evolution versus Biblical Special Creation and\nwhether, as Plantinga maintains, methodological naturalism functions as a\nbackground of ontological presuppositions relative to which Special Creation\nis rendered untenable. According to Plantinga, it is a background that the theist\nshould not feel compelled to accept. Unlike Plantinga, I assume the truth of some\naccount of biological evolution, and I also accept that natural selection is an\nimportant source of evolutionary change. However, I will argue in what follows\nthat methodological naturalism, construed as a definitive refusal to entertain\ntheistic possibilities in a scientific context, itself entails ontological claims that are\nantagonistic to theism. Hence, contrary to McMullin\u2019s claim that methodological\nnaturalism does not amount to \u2018an ontological claim about what sort of agency is\nor is not possible\u2019, I will argue that it does sometimes entail such commitments. In\nwhat follows, I will focus on the claim that God communicates with people during\nreligious experiences. I will show that refusal to entertain this theistic hypothesis\nas an integral aspect of scientific inquiry into the neural basis of religious\nexperience ultimately entails a denial of the veridicality of religious experience.\nThe contents of religious experience\nIn order to argue that supposedly neutral, methodological naturalism in\nrelation to the neurology of religious experience actually involves the denial of the\nontological claim that God communicates with people through religious experi-\nence, one must first give some indication of what this claim involves. What is\nmeant by a \u2018religious experience\u2019 and by the \u2018object\u2019 of such an experience?\nWhat common experience can be said to unify the category \u2018religious\u2019 and what\nelements, if any, do all religious experiences incorporate? Reports of religious\nThe neurology of religious experience 327\nexperiences are culturally and historically extremely diverse. Not only do religious\nexperiences involve a vast diversity of elements but many of these elements are\nexclusive to only certain doctrines and may be incompatible with the central\ntenets of other doctrines. Hence in order to extract elements common to all, many\nfeatures must be regarded as inessential.\nIn addressing the question of whether there is a common core underlying all\nreligious experiences, it is instructive to turn to William James\u2019s classic discussion\nin The Varieties of Religious Experience. James surveys a plethora of different\nkinds of religious experience and argues that, in order to extract that which is\nshared by and essential to all, one has to subordinate the intellectual aspect of the\nexperience to a more basic feeling :\nIndividuality is founded in feeling; and the recesses of feeling, the darker, blinder\nstrata of character, are the only places in the world in which we catch real fact in\nthe making, and directly perceive how events happen, and how work is actually\ndone. Compared with this world of living, individualized feelings, the world of\ngeneralized objects which the intellect contemplates is in fact without solidity\nor life. (1902, 501\u2013502)\nCultural and historical variation in the contents of religious experiences arises,\naccording to James, from the secondary imposition of over-beliefs, culturally\ndiverse intellectualizations that differently interpret a common experience (1902,\n504). The underlying feelings, however, constitute a universal experiential\n\u2018nucleus\u2019. This nucleus takes the form of an initial sense of general unease, or un-\nhomeliness, that is subsequently resolved through the feeling of a higher power\nwith which one comes to connect or bond (1902, 507). The contents of this core\nexperience do not conform exclusively to any specific religious doctrine. In fact,\nas James admits, they are so generic as to accommodate the imposition of either\nmonotheistic or polytheistic over-beliefs. However, he qualifies this by saying\nthat \u2018God is the natural appellation, for us Christians at least, for the supreme\nreality, so I will call this higher part of the universe by the name of God\u2019 (1902,\n516). James\u2019s discussion thus suggests a common content of religious experiences\nthat can be described as a feeling of some higher power which infuses one\u2019s world\nwith meaning. This core experience does not conform exclusively to the specifics\nof any one religious doctrine. As Mackie (1982, 183) puts it, the most that such\nexperiences can assure us of is \u2018 the existence of some greater friendly power,\nwhose precise identity and character are left wholly indeterminate\u2019.\nBut should the feeling of communion with a higher being be regarded as real or\nillusory? James contends that religious experience does indeed point to a genuine\nreality beyond the mundane, physical, objective world, to a higher power with\nwhich the experiencer really does communicate. But his argument in support of\nthis, that the world of religious experience affects our actions and anything that\naffects our actions must be real (1902, 516), is implausible, given that illusions and\n328 MATTHEW RATCL I FFE\nhallucinations can also have a real influence upon our actions.7 However, James\u2019s\ndescription of the content of the experience does constitute a plausible account\nof the essential elements of religious experience, if not a compelling argument\nfor the reality of its object. And this account fits in very nicely with the\nexperiences reported by Ramachandran\u2019s subjects. Ramachandran describes how\nfocal temporal-lobe seizures can induce \u2018deeply moving spiritual experiences,\nincluding a feeling of divine presence and the sense that they are in direct com-\nmunion with God. Everything around them is imbued with cosmic significance\u2019\n(1998, 179). The experience, as with James\u2019s descriptions, seems to involve two\nelements, a feeling of communion with a higher being and an infusion of life with\na new sense of meaning. James and Ramachandran also agree with respect to the\ncentrality of emotion to religious experience. James not only acknowledges the\nprimacy of emotion but also accepts that feelings can constitute a legitimate\nguide to aspects of reality that are missed by commonplace intellectualizations.\nThe importance of emotion as a constituent of one\u2019s cognition of and basic\norientation towards the world is readily apparent in Ramachandran\u2019s work (see\n1998, chs 7, 8, 9). It is also explicit in Damasio\u2019s recent neurological studies\nof emotion (1995, 2000). On the basis of such studies, it is not implausible to\nmaintain that emotions can play an important role in revealing the world rather\nthan merely obfuscating our intellectualization of things. Thus, the emotional\nfoundation of religious experience does not in itself amount to a compelling\nreason for dismissing its object as illusory.8\nSo, in considering the veridicality of religious experience, the possibility one is\nrequired to entertain is that God is communicating with the subject in some\nbroad sense. According to James, this generic feeling is the source of all religion.\nHence a denial of its object, in conjunction with a realist understanding of\nreligious belief, would amount to atheism. However, it is clear that, even if\nsuch experiences are not the sole source of and motivation for religious belief,\nthey play a major role in many, if not all, religions. So a global denial of their\nveridicality would amount to an ontological claim that is, if not synonymous with\natheism, at least antagonistic to theism. In the next section I will show that\n\u2018methodological \u2019 naturalism entails just such a denial.\nExplaining the neurology of religious experience: methodology\nand ontology\nIn postulating a common neural basis for religious experience, Rama-\nchandran\u2019s studies support James\u2019s claim that it is a unitary phenomenon, rather\nthan an arbitrary categorization of disparate, culturally diverse, and ultimately\ndissimilar experiences. If methodological naturalism or scientific agnosticism\nconcerning the experiential object is defensible and sustainable, then there is no\nsubsequent scientific question of whether these experiences have a genuine\nThe neurology of religious experience 329\nobject or whether they are illusory or mistaken. But howmight one obtain a more\nspecific scientific explanation of how, and why, certain parts of the brain are\ninvolved in the production of religious experience? Ramachandran emphasizes\nthe importance of an evolutionary explanation and states that, in order to obtain\na comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms involved, the question one\nhas to address is \u2018what sorts of Darwinian selection pressures could lead to such a\nmechanism?\u2019 (1998, 183).\nOne conceivable evolutionary explanation of the capacity for religious experi-\nence is that a specific neural structure (A) has the function of producing religious\nexperiences (x). \u2018A has function x \u2019 is generally taken to mean something like\n(1) A consistently has effect x, and (2) A came to exist or continues to exist in its\ncurrent form because it does x. In other words, selection pressures that favoured\nthe ability to do x have shaped the development of A.9 A broadly functional or\nadaptationist account of any A\u2019s capacity to x can accommodate a number of\ndifferent historical scenarios.\n(1) A exists in its current form as a result of long-term selection pressures that\nincrementally shaped it so as to better perform x and only x. Hence x is currently\nthe sole function of A and has been for some considerable time.\n(2) A originally arose due to selection pressures that shaped it to perform task\ny. However, the way it performed task y also made it coincidentally able to aid the\naccomplishment of task x. During its more recent evolutionary history, ability to\nperform task x took over as the primary selection pressure shaping devel-\nopment of A. Hence, the current function of A is x, though its function was pre-\nviously y and, in order to understand its structure, we must appreciate the role of\nboth x and y in shaping its evolution. To apply a term coined by Gould and Vrba\n(1982), A\u2019s performance of x is an exaptation, a role that it was not originally\nselected for but which has more recently become the primary focus of selection\npressures on A.10\n(3) A once had function x but its function is now y.\n(4) A evolved as a result of its ability to perform task x or y and was then\nshaped by natural selection as a result of its ability to perform the other task too.\nIt retains both functions.\n(5) x is a current function of A but A had and still has a number of other\nfunctions which have to be taken into consideration in order to understand why A\nhas its current form.\n(6) x is a current function of structure B. A is part of B and is integral to B\u2019s\ncapacity to x.11\nAll of the above involve some kind of adaptationist claim in respect of A\u2019s\ncapacity to x. That is, selection pressures favouring the production of x have or\nonce had an influence on the genesis or persistence of structures of type A.\nHowever, a number of other historical scenarios are also possible. That structure\nA and effect x are in some broad sense a product of selection does not imply\n330 MATTHEW RATCL I FFE\nthat either A or x were themselves selected for. It is possible that (a) x is not\nand never was a function of A, or even (b) that A itself has no function and\nnever had a function. The following accounts all incorporate either (a) or (b) or\nboth.\n(1) y is a function of A but x is a malfunction to which A is disposed as a\nconsequence of its ability to perform y. In other words, x is not something A was\nselected to do and x impairs either A\u2019s or some other organismic structure\u2019s\nability to perform its function.\n(2) x is not and never was a function of A. It is a contingent effect arising from\nA\u2019s being shaped by natural selection to carry out function y. For example, the\nheart has the effect of making a thumping noise, which is not a function of the\nheart but a consequence of its pumping function. In such scenarios, x is not\na malfunction but a non-functional side effect of another function. To adopt\nGould and Lewontin\u2019s (1979) well-known term, x is a spandrel, a non-functional\neffect arising from selection pressures acting on a different capacity.\n(3) A has no function. A is itself a spandrel, entailing that any effect x of A is\nalso a spandrel. Natural selection never acted directly upon A, and its genesis and\npersistence can only be explained by treating it as a non-adaptive structural side\neffect of a greater adapted system.\n(4) A facilitates x but x is not a biological capacity of A. Consider, for example,\nusing a knife and fork, doing crossword puzzles, and watching films. For con-\nvenience, I treat \u2018x is not a biological capacity of A\u2019 as a subcategory of \u2018x is a\nspandrel\u2019. Within this more general category, some spandrels are more suited to\nbiological explanations than others.\nThe above comprise a fairly comprehensive but highly simplified list of the\nvarious possible evolutionary explanations of how a biological structure A and\none of its effects x came about. They can be grouped into three more general\ncategories:\n(1) x is or was a function of A.\n(2) x is a malfunction of A.\n(3) A\/x has no function and never has had.\nIf this explanatory framework is applied to the neural pathways associated with\nreligious experience, it would seem that one of many possible coherent ex-\nplanations is (1) that certain structures in the temporal-lobe and limbic system\n(A) have the function of facilitating religious experience (x), and that religious\nexperience is functional because it allows communication with God.12 (This is\nmore specific than \u2018God communicates with people during religious experi-\nences\u2019, as it is not inconceivable that God communicates with people, even\nthough they do not have specialized structures whose function is to facilitate such\ncommunication.) Given that such an explanation seems perfectly coherent, why,\nThe neurology of religious experience 331\none might ask, should it not be entertained as a scientific possibility? As Joseph\n(2001, 132) notes of religious experiences and their various objects:\nWhy would the limbic system evolve specialized neurons or neural networks that\nsubserve the capacity to experience or hallucinate spirits, angels, and the souls of\nthe departed if these entities had no basis in reality? \u2026 Perhaps under the guiding\ninfluence of \u2018God\u2019, or perhaps after repeated experiences with gods, spirits, demons,\nangels, and lost souls, homo sapiens evolved these neurons, which enabled them to\nbetter cope with the unknown as well as to perceive and respond to spiritual\nmessages that increased likelihood of survival. A true scientist would not rule out\nsuch a possibility.\nWhy is \u2018the function of certain structures is to aid communication with God\u2019 not\na respectable hypothesis? Ramachandran claims that it \u2018can neither be proved\nnor ruled out on empirical grounds\u2019 (1998, 182), implying that empirical findings\ncan have no bearing whatsoever on whether religious experience has a genuine\nobject or not. Whichever explanation of A and its effect x we settle on, evol-\nutionary explanation of religious experience will, according to Ramachandran,\nhave no implications so far as the reality of its object is concerned.\nHowever, a cursory glance at the possible evolutionary explanations of A and x\nsuggests that this is not the case at all. For example, suppose one claims (2) that\nstructure A evolved due to its ability to perform task y and that its current struc-\nture can be comprehensively accounted for in relation to task y. When structure A\nis involved in religious experience (x), its ability to perform y is detrimentally\naffected. It is also apparent from further study that any structure able to perform y\nwill as a consequence be susceptible to certain forms of disturbance, damage, or\ndevelopmental anomaly that will result in effect x. It turns out that x has no bio-\nlogically advantageous effect and is almost invariably damaging to the organism.\nThus, it seems reasonable to infer that x is a malfunction of A. If x is a malfunction\nof A, then this automatically rules out the possibility that x is a function of A. And\nif scientific explanations can rule out a hypothesis, it is surely mistaken to claim\nthat they can have no bearing on the probability of that hypothesis.\nA malfunction explanation not only rules out the claim that religious experi-\nence is a function of A, but also casts doubt on the more general claim that such\nexperiences have a real object. If the experience is a malfunction then it is\nsomething that has gone wrong and any experiential object arising from cognitive\nmalfunction is presumably to be treated with incredulity, just as the objects of\nexperiences resulting from the ingestion of drugs that distort normal cortical func-\ntion are generally taken not to exist. There is no reason for anyone, including the\nexperiential subject, to assume the veridicality of an experience that results from\ncognitive processes that are by definition unreliable.\nWhen it comes to empirical assessment of a malfunction hypothesis, thematter\nis less than clear. Ramachandran considers the question of whether religious\nexperience is a result of a malfunction, noting of one subject that \u2018he was intense\n332 MATTHEW RATCL I FFE\nand self-absorbed and had the arrogance of a believer but none of the humility of\nthe deeply religious\u2019 (1998, 180). However, he also observes that these experiences\nare not obviously detrimental to a subject\u2019s wellbeing. Indeed, the subject herself\noften finds the experience highly desirable. Hence, Ramachandran remarks that\n\u2018the physician has no right, really, to attribute a value label to such esoteric\nembellishments of personality. On what basis does one decide whether a mystical\nexperience is normal or abnormal?\u2019 (1998, 184). But such ambiguity does not\namount to a sufficient reason for claiming in-principle undecidability. After all,\nmany evolutionary explanations are to some extent speculative and, despite the\nambiguity as to whether religious experience amounts to an obvious impairment,\nappeal to historical selection processes could conceivably help to resolve the\nissue in respect of malfunction.\nSo we can see how the malfunction hypothesis excludes the possibility that the\nfunction of A is to communicate with God and also how this would in turn cast\ndoubt upon the more general claim that God is really present during religious\nexperiences. A similar argument can be played out in relation to versions of claim\n(3) that religious experience is a spandrel, as opposed to a malfunction. Suppose\nthat neural structure A is a part of a greater structure B, which historically evolved\nto perform a complex and intricate set of functions. It turns out that an un-\navoidable structural consequence of B\u2019s ability to perform functions v, w, y, and z\nis A, which is not itself and never has been the object of selection pressures.\nHowever, it turns out that B couldn\u2019t arise without producing A as a side effect. An\nunavoidable consequence of A\u2019s structure is that it sometimes induces a certain\nkind of experience that is neither obviously advantageous nor disadvantageous\nto the organism. Again, such a hypothesis is difficult to corroborate convincingly,\nbut concerns about the availability and adequacy of evidence plague many\nsuch evolutionary explanations and it is not clear that this case is qualitatively\ndifferent.\nAs in the malfunction case, a spandrel explanation rules out the possibility that\nthe structure\u2019s function is to talk to God, as spandrels are, by definition, structures\nthat don\u2019t have functions. And like the malfunction explanation, a spandrel\nscenario casts doubt upon the more general claim that religious experience has a\nreal object. If A is a spandrel, then its genesis, persistence, and various effects,\nsuch as x, can be wholly accounted for independent of any environmental influ-\nences that directly influenced the tendency to x. Spandrels do not systematically\nrelate to the environment in any way that has historically had adaptive conse-\nquences for the organism. Otherwise, selection pressures would no doubt have\ninfluenced their genesis, persistence, and causal properties, and so an adap-\ntationist account would constitute a partial explanation of their being, implying\nthat they were not spandrels at all. If religious experience is an effect x of a\nspandrel A, any reference to an environmental cause that has shaped A\u2019s tend-\nency to produce effect x is ruled out, whether that cause be the communicative\nThe neurology of religious experience 333\nacts of God or anything else. A\u2019s disposition to x is wholly explicable in terms of\nselection pressures acting on some other organismic capacity, with A and x\nemerging as contingent side effects of functional capacities to which they make\nno contribution. So, if religious experience is a spandrel in the strictest sense, its\nhaving a genuine object is ruled out by definition, as no such object has played a\nhistorical role in the causal genesis of the experience, and if it plays no such role,\nit cannot be in communion with the experiencer.\nThese examples show that empirical considerations are relevant to an assess-\nment of the claim that the function of A is to talk to God and also to the more\ngeneral question of the veridicality of religious experience. However, one might\nobject that methodological naturalism does not deny the possibility of conflict\nbetween specific scientific hypotheses and certain theistic claims, so, contra\nRamachandran, perhaps properly methodological agnosticism only arises in the\nfirst type of case, where religious experience is taken to be a function of A. Any\nadaptive effects of religious experience could arguably be explained just as well\nwithout invoking the presence of God as a contributing factor as, whether its\nobject is real or illusory, the effects of religious experience will be the same and\nthe following two hypotheses will be scientifically indistinguishable:\n(1) Structure A has the function of inducing a feeling of God\u2019s\npresence and this has adaptive consequences.\n(2) Structure A has the function of inducing a feeling of God\u2019s\npresence and this has adaptive consequences and God exists.\nScientific agnosticism is unavoidably entailed if there is no way that (1) and (2)\ncan be empirically distinguished, and it might seem that \u2018God exists \u2019 is a spuri-\nous additional proposition that can, in the context of scientific inquiry, be re-\nmoved for simplicity\u2019s sake without any empirical ramifications. However, this is\nmisleading. Consider as an analogy \u2018Perceptual systems have the function of\nproducing a mental map of the world and the world exists\u2019. An evolutionary\nexplanation of the function of perceptual systems that did not presuppose the\nexistence of the world would have to do an awful lot more work in order to explain\nthe function of perceptual systems, even though there is no absolutely conclusive\nway of deciding between the two alternatives, as several hundred years of philo-\nsophical scepticism concerning the external world illustrates. Surely the same\nreasoning applies to religious experience, thus allowing for the possibility that the\nmost plausible evolutionary explanation is one that actually invokes God as a\nbeing with whom communication carries some evolutionary advantage. Why not,\nas James suggests, take religious experiences to be veridical? Indeed, why not take\na biological adaptation for talking with God as one\u2019s initial hypothesis rather than\nexclude it a priori from consideration?\nHowever, even if this hypothesis is, for some reason, excluded from scientific\nconsideration, it could still be argued that a scientific functional explanation of\n334 MATTHEW RATCL I FFE\nA\u2019s capacity to x might involve assigning a function that is at least compatible\nwith the claims that (a) God is present during certain experiences, and (b) a\nfunction of certain neural structures is to facilitate such communication. And if\nthere is no unavoidable ontological incompatibility between methodological\nnaturalism and such theistic claims, then naturalism is agnostic rather than\natheistic in its refusal to address the question. Contrary to such a position, I\nsuggest that even this minimal compatibility is illusory. In other words, refusal\nto entertain (b) as a possible scientific explanation ultimately rules out both (a)\nand (b).\nConsider \u2018Structure A has the function of inducing experience of God and this\nhas adaptive consequences because \u2018\u2018God exists\u2019\u2019 \u2019. By replacing \u2018and\u2019 with \u2018be-\ncause\u2019, we can see how God\u2019s existence constitutes not a spurious additional\nproposition but an explanation of why A\u2019s doing x has an adaptive effect. God is\nsingled out as the environmental cause of the experience, the environmental in-\nfluence that was instrumental in the historical shaping of structure A\u2019s capacity\nto produce effect x, just as light is causally instrumental in the evolution of eyes.\nRefusal to entertain the possibility that the function of a structure really is to\ncommunicate with God effectively amounts to a refusal to consider the possibility\nthat God, as part of the selective environment in which organisms evolve, could at\nany time have had any causal influence on the genesis of a structure or upon\nits tendency to produce certain effects. Thus, God could have no influence on\nthe evolution of a capacity for religious experience. If an explanation of re-\nligious experience rules out the causal efficacy of God in producing the experi-\nence, this immediately denies any warrant for claiming that God, as the object of\nreligious experience, is real. If God has no causal efficacy in relation to religious\nexperience then communion with God is simply not a real part of the experience.\nWhat may at first seem like agnosticism ultimately amounts to denial.\nConsider the following:\n(1) Structure A has the function of producing religious experiences\nand this has adaptive consequences because such experiences\nstrengthen social bonding.\n(2) Structure A has the function of facilitating religious experiences\nand this has adaptive consequences because God exists.\nThese could be rendered compatible by maintaining that communication with\nGod enables social bonding. However, if one refuses to consider (2) as a scientific\npossibility, then such compatibilism is by implication also ruled out as a scientific\npossibility. If (1) without (2) is an incomplete explanation, in the same sense that\n\u2018the function of the visual system is to produce the experience of a visual world\u2019 is\nincomplete without the additional claim that this function is efficacious because\nthe world exists, then there can be no justification for excluding (2) and settling\nfor an incomplete explanation. If God is the primary historical environmental\nThe neurology of religious experience 335\ncause of the evolution of structure A and its effect x, then functional explanation\nof A and x should refer to God, just as water must be invoked in order to explain\nthe development of fins, their function being to \u2018flap\u2019 constituting a horribly\nuninformative explanation. The alternative is to maintain that something like (1)\namounts to a comprehensive scientific explanation of the causal forces operating\nin the selective environment of A and thus a comprehensive account of all causes\nrelevant to A\u2019s performance of function x, with the result that God is allocated no\ncausal role whatsoever and so any sense of communion with God is illusory. Of\ncourse, one might contend that God\u2019s influence is not necessarily \u2018causal\u2019, in the\nusual sense of the term, but may involve a very different medium to that of\nphysical causation. However, insofar as such an influence would still produce a\ngenuine effect in the subject, denial of physical causation could just as well be\nconstrued as a reason not to reject God as a real feature of the selective en-\nvironment, but to reconsider one\u2019s ontology and embrace more than simply\nphysical causation. A rejection of such influences would, in any case, constitute\nan ontological rather than a methodological restriction which, if there are non-\ncausal influences resulting in organismic effects, amounts to an ontologically\nincomplete picture of the world.\nRefusal to consider the possibility that the function of religious experience is to\ncommunicate with God is ultimately equivalent to a denial that God, as a part of\nthe organismic environment in which natural selection operates, could in any\nway causally influence the genesis of biological structures and their effects. If\nreligious experience is to be explained biologically, the result is a denial that such\nexperiences have a real object, at least if one accepts an epistemology according\nto which an x\u2019s having some effect upon a subject is a necessary condition for\nthat subject\u2019s having any grounds for believing in the reality of x. One way out of\nthis is to postulate a two-tier model of functions, where something can have\nfunction y in the context of biology but function x in the context of religious\ndiscussion, resulting in two distinct but somehow harmonious universes of dis-\ncourse. However, if a biological account purports in any way to investigate or\nexplain specifically religious experience, then the two universes have already\ncollided. If everything belonging to the category of religious experience and re-\nligion more generally is excluded from science, then the problem can\u2019t arise to\nbegin with, as talk of a neural structure associated with religious experience\nwould be disallowed. Though such a division of worlds might put paid to dis-\ncussions like this one, it would also involve a strict compartmentalization of\nhuman life that would most likely be unacceptable to most and also almost\nimpossible to sustain.\nTo summarize, methodological naturalism (construed as the refusal to con-\nsider any hypothesis that makes reference to God\u2019s existence), coupled with the\napplication of a fairly standard framework for evolutionary explanation,\nunavoidably translates into an ontological exclusion when applied to the\n336 MATTHEW RATCL I FFE\nhypothesis : \u2018 the function of A is to communicate with God\u2019. Hence, it involves\na form of ontological commitment that is antithetical to any religious doctrine\nascribing some degree of importance to veridical religious experience.\nInterpretation and constitutive commitment\nIn the preceding section I discussed the issue of the neural basis of\nreligious experience as though it were in principle resolvable in a wholly empiri-\ncal fashion, naturalism amounting to the exclusion of one empirical scenario.\nHowever, things are not so simple, and in this section I will argue that \u2018method-\nological \u2019 naturalism is an ontological commitment that is in an important sense\nprior to empirical considerations. That is, it serves as a pre-theoretical back-\nground of interpretation that determines the kinds of things one is prepared to\nadmit into being.\nMy reason for focusing specifically on the neurology of religious experience as a\nphilosophical case study is that it serves to illustrate a robust ontological assump-\ntion that would pass unnoticed in the majority of selectionist explanations. Thus\nmy argument is not an extended tirade against a few remarks made by Rama-\nchandran, but an attempt to bring to the foreground a much more general point\nconcerning ontological presuppositions underlying any so-calledmethodological\nnaturalism. In order to develop this point more fully, it is important to under-\nstand why the neurology of religious experience is of special interest.\nIn many circumstances, assignment of function does seem religiously neutral.\nDarwin replaced instantaneous special creation by God with evolution via natural\nselection as the proximal mechanism of biological adaptation. However, this does\nnot rule out God as the ultimate source, acting through the various evolutionary\nmechanisms to create organisms. Such a simplistic conception of compatibility is\nnot without its problems (see e.g. Ruse (2001)). However, the crucial point is that\nthe function of a biological structure can be the same whether or not one chooses\nto invoke God as the ultimate source of biological \u2018design\u2019. Consider a simple\ncase such as \u2018the function of the eye is to see\u2019, or \u2018the function of the hand is to\ngrasp objects\u2019. Whether God exists or not will not, it would seem, affect function\nassignments in such cases and, similarly, assigned functions will have no bearing\non the claim that God exists. Thus, though it is by no means clear that science\nshould remain neutral on the question of whether God is the ultimate agency\nbehind the genesis of the biological world, it does appear that agnosticism is a\ngenerally tenable position so far as the ultimate source of biological adaptation is\nconcerned.\nHowever, in the case of the neurology of religious experience, the situation is\nvery different and this is because we are not being asked to consider whether God\nis the ultimate agency behind the evolutionary process but whether God can be\nThe neurology of religious experience 337\ntaken as part of the selective environment in relation to which that process op-\nerates upon organisms. If God is not a part of the selective environment to which\norganisms are adapted by natural selection, then no part of any organism can\nhave a function involving God, as the kinds of function one is prepared to assign\ndepend on the kinds of thing one is prepared to admit as possible constituents of\nthe selective environment. For example, if fish were not part of any organismic\nenvironment, no biological structure could have the function of perceiving,\nevading, luring, catching, dismembering, digesting, or parasitizing fish. Thus, in\nthe case of the organismic environment in which selection acts, refusal to enter-\ntain the possibility of God as an active part of the environment, able to affect\norganisms, results in an ontological restriction in relation to possible character-\nistics of the biological world. Hence, the neurology of religious experience serves\nas a thought-experiment with which to reveal a metaphysical commitment at-\ntached to any exclusion of God from biological inquiry. This commitment\ninvolves rejection of God as a part of the causally efficacious environment in\nwhich organisms evolve. If God exists, then God is not a part of the world in which\nwe live and act.\nSuch restrictions not only serve to constrain the kinds of functions one is pre-\npared to admit as a possibility but also the kinds of beings one is prepared to allow\nas possible constituents of reality. This is because there are many cases where\nfunctions are not just properties that are assigned to pre-given entities but rather\nconstitute those entities, making them what they are. This is readily apparent in\nthe case of artifacts such as can openers, screwdrivers and chairs. As Heidegger\nremarks, \u2018 the functionality that goes with chair, table, window is exactly that\nwhich makes the thing what it is \u2019, (1982, \u00b715, 164). And it is equally true of many\nbiological entities. Consider a structure such as a wing, a hand, or a claw. The\nindividuation of such a structure makes essential reference to its function. Wings,\nfor instance, are individuated in terms of their functional role in relation to\nflight. Indeed Millikan (1984) and Neander (1991) have argued that biological\ncategories are invariably functional categories, a biological structure\u2019s function\nmaking it the thing that it is. However, this strong claim may well need to\nbe deflated. As Amundson and Lauder (1994) note, in criticizing Neander and\nMillikan, biological structures are often classified phylogenetically, in terms\nof anatomical homology, and it is by no means clear that such classifications\nmake essential reference to functions. For example, a pentadactyl limb is still\na pentadactyl limb, whatever its function may be. Nevertheless, it is safe to say\nthat a substantial proportion of biological entities are functionally individuated.\nThus, preconceptions concerning the nature of the environment that restrict\nthe range of possible functions one is prepared to entertain also restrict the range\nof possible beings.\nOne consequence of this is that refusal to consider the claim that God is or was\nan influential part of the selective environment entails a denial of the possibility\n338 MATTHEW RATCL I FFE\nof a \u2018God module\u2019, taken literally. This is because modules, as conceived\nby evolutionary psychologists, are individuated functionally rather than anatom-\nically. As Pinker vividly puts it :\nMental modules are not likely to be visible to the naked eye as circumscribed territories\non the surface of the brain, like the flank steak and the rump roast on the supermarket\ncow display. A mental module probably looks more like a roadkill, sprawling messily\nover the bulges and crevasses of the brain (1998, 30).\nBut if function x isn\u2019t possible, then any structure whose individuation pre-\nsupposes the possibility of function x is also not possible. Thus a God module, a\nfunctionally individuated structure whose function is to communicate in some\nway with God, is impossible. Refusal to entertain the possibility of God as an\nenvironmental influence, relative to which different organismic responses have a\ndifferential effect in relation to organismic survival and reproduction, will simi-\nlarly rule out a whole range of entities. Preconceptions concerning what the\norganismic environment contains act as an interpretive background relative to\nwhich only certain entities and functions are deemed possible. So exclusion of\nGod as a part of that environment amounts to an ontological exclusion of myriad\nconceivable beings.\nIn stark contrast to this Godless environment is Alvin Plantinga\u2019s claim that\nbelief in God is properly basic for the believer. According to Plantinga, (e.g. 1981,\n46\u201347), beliefs such as \u2018God is speaking to me\u2019, \u2018God disapproves of what I have\ndone\u2019, and \u2018God forgives me\u2019 are basic in the sense that \u2018I see a tree\u2019 is basic. That\nis, the contents of such beliefs reflect an everyday experiential environment in\nwhich God is always present for the believer and taken for granted in an anal-\nogous sense to the majority of everyday perceptual beliefs.\nSuch radically different basic conceptions of what the world is like are clearly\nnot methodological constraints but contrasting ways of interpreting the world\nthat determine the kinds of beings one is willing to entertain as possible con-\nstituents of reality. One\u2019s conception of the environment serves as a background\nfrom which one interprets the biological world so as to assign functions and indi-\nviduate structures.Differentbackgroundcommitments concerningwhat theworld\nis like will thus result in different ontologies. The naturalist assumes that God is\nin no way tangible. In so doing, she rules out God as a possible part of the en-\nvironment, an environment that serves as a presuppositional interpretive back-\nground for the understanding of biological structures.\nOne might object that it is simply the case that we describe the environment\nas carefully as we can and discover that God is not an efficacious part of it. Hence\nthe methodological naturalist does not rule out God a priori but, after careful\nempirical investigation, concludes that there is no evidence of such an environ-\nmental influence, which is why it is not the subject of any empirically based\ninquiry.\nThe neurology of religious experience 339\nA problem with this is that the nature of the selection-relevant environment is\nnot always readily apparent in the case of any given organism or organ. Adap-\ntationist inquiries can go either of two ways:\n(1) One lists some salient features of the environment in which x\nevolved and considers whether x might have evolved as an\nadaptive response to one or more of these features.13\n(2) One hypothesizes that structure x is an adaptation and considers\nthe kind of environment that x might be or have been an adaptive\nresponse to.14\nIn the case of (1), a description of the relevant environment is taken for granted.\nHowever, in (2) the nature of the environment is itself a matter of debate, the\nquestion being \u2018what kinds of possible environmental influences are the most\nplausible evolutionary causes of a structure like A?\u2019 In practice, these two strands\nof inquiry are often likely to be intertwined. Absolute inflexibility with respect to\nthe nature of the environment in which any structure evolved is likely to obfus-\ncate inquiry by ruling out investigation of various possible functions, structures,\nand historical scenarios.\nSo one might maintain that, in the case of religious experience, inflexible pre-\nsuppositions concerning the environment rule out the possibility of the very thing\nthat could constitute evidence of a novel environmental influence. That is, unless\nwe at least entertain the possibility that God is a part of the environment in which\nevolution occurs, we will deny the possibility of any biological structure whose\nexistence might constitute evidence for such a claim. However, our naturalist\nmight reply that, although the selective environment relevant to any specific ex-\nample of biological adaptation is a matter of debate, there is a common taxonomy\nof causally efficacious environmental features from which the environment rel-\nevant to any specific example of organismic adaptation is comprised. As God is\nnot a part of this taxonomy, God cannot be plausibly maintained as a possible\nenvironmental influence on the genesis of biological structures.\nBut the contention that we have such a description of the environment is\ndubious at best. When one tries to describe the objective way in which the world\nmost absolutely, fundamentally is, it becomes readily apparent that this is an\nextremely difficult undertaking. Nowhere is this better illustrated than in Hus-\nserl\u2019s (1970, II\u00b79h, IIIA) discussion of the \u2018life-world\u2019 ; a tacit background of taken-\nfor-granted reality that is presupposed by naive objective conceptions of the way\nthings are; the \u2018forgotten meaning-fundament of natural science\u2019 (1970, \u00b79h, 48).\nAs Gurwitsch (1974, 17) explains, the concept of the life-world, as put forward by\nHusserl and elaborated by Schutz, \u2018 the life-world is defined as comprising all\nitems and objects which present themselves in pre-scientific experience and as\nthey present themselves prior to their scientific interpretation in the modern\nsense\u2019. It is a world-disclosing foundation that has \u2018been obscured, obfuscated,\n340 MATTHEW RATCL I FFE\nand forgotten\u2019 and is consequently very difficult to describe; a background pre-\nsupposed by all scientific abstractions, \u2018whose simple acceptance proves an es-\nsential precondition of every activity\u2019 (1974, 144).\nHusserl\u2019s account of the life-world suggests that scientific conceptions of the\nobjective world presuppose various constitutive methods which abstract from the\npre-given life-world and, in so doing, differently determine the kinds of beings\none is prepared to admit as elements of theoretical, scientific ontologies.15 And\nthis is precisely the constitutive capacity in which naturalism seems to function.\nAs certain biological entities presuppose a naturalistic interpretive background\nfor their sense, it cannot be argued that such a background can simply be\nempirically described, given that empirical conceptions of the way things are\npresuppose rather than entail it. So, as naturalism is an a priori restriction that\ndetermines the kinds of things that are admitted into being, it cannot itself be\nlegitimated via appeal to those very beings. Thus, in order to begin to consider\nwhether God is a plausible constituent of the evolutionary environment, one is\nrequired to suspend acceptance of biological objectivities that have already been\nconstituted naturalistically, and contemplate the possibility of alternative inter-\npretive stances that integrate God as a possible experiential object and environ-\nmental influence.\n\u2018Methodological \u2019 naturalism ultimately amounts to an interpretive background\nthat determines the kinds of things one is prepared to admit as possible con-\nstituents of reality. If this background is taken as an inflexible conception of what\nthe objective world can contain, then any conception of the world that involves\nGod as an active part of experienced reality is excluded. Thus, the naturalism in\nquestion translates into a substantial ontological commitment that is antagon-\nistic to a large body of religious doctrine. What\u2019s more, it is arguably impossible to\nrefute empirically, as the possibility of any phenomenon that could possibly\nrefute it is denied. And this is because any biological phenomenon can in prin-\nciple be interpreted so as to fit in with it if one tries hard enough. Consider\nthe following, where A presupposes an atheistic interpretive background and B\na theistic background:\n(A) x is a malfunction of a structure A that performs y.\n(B) A ordinarily performs y but it has also evolved the capacity for x,\nwhich is the privilege of the spiritually enlightened.\n(A) A used to have a function x but doesn\u2019t any more.\n(B) A is functional but not in our individualistic, atheistic society.\n(A) A is a spandrel that resulted as a contingent consequence of B\u2019s\ndevelopment of function y.\n(B) B\u2019s y\u2019ing only persists because it now supports A\u2019s x\u2019ing.\nI suspect that these sorts of contrasting interpretations can be formulated in\nrelation to just about any biological phenomenon and that there is no wholly\nThe neurology of religious experience 341\nempirical way of deciding between them, given that one\u2019s understanding of what\nthe world contains is itself differently carved out by different interpretive back-\ngrounds. What may look to someone like an adaptation for x can be reinterpreted\nas a structural constraint by someone else who doesn\u2019t want to find an adaptation\nfor x. If it looks too intricate to be a structural constraint, various complex evol-\nutionary contingencies can be invoked until the story starts to look plausible. It\nis not possible to see functions, malfunctions, and contingent effects in the bio-\nlogical world. They are interpretations that presuppose a view of how things are.\nIf these presuppositions are set in stone, then anything can be made to fit in with\nthem.\nTo illustrate this point, consider an analogy. Gould and Lewontin famously\nargued that the adaptationist programme prevalent in biology during the 1970s\namounted to a collection of \u2018speculative tales\u2019 (1979\/1994, 73) . Every effect of\nevery structure was assumed a priori to be an adaptation and all other alternatives\nwere implicitly ruled out. A story could always be strung together to support some\nadaptationist interpretation; \u2018since the range of adaptive stories is as wide as our\nminds are fertile, new stories can always be postulated\u2019 (1979\/1994, 79). Thus,\naccording to Gould and Lewontin, adaptationist methodology amounted to a\nself-perpetuating way of thinking that refused to entertain contrary possibilities.\nI suggest that the same is true of naturalism, construed as an unwavering\ncommitment to what the world is like that determines the domain of acceptable\nphenomena. Even though naturalistic explanations, unlike the adaptationism\nsatirized by Gould and Lewontin, incorporate all manner of different evolutionary\nexplanations, naturalism places a limit on the range of acceptable phenomena\nand it can reinterpret and accommodate anything that doesn\u2019t at first seem to fit.\nThus naturalism constitutes a broader, more embracing narrative than adap-\ntationism but, if held inflexibly, it amounts to dogmatic enforcement of a meta-\nphysical lens through which the world is interpreted. Gould and Lewontin list\nfour criteria for bad adaptationist story-telling (1979\/1994, 79). Below I have listed\nthe first three,16 replacing the word \u2018adaptive\u2019 with the term \u2018naturalistic\u2019. As you\ncan see, it works pretty well :\n(1) If one [naturalistic] argument fails, try another.\n(2) If one [naturalistic] argument fails, assume that another must exist ;\na weaker version of the first argument.\n(3) In the absence of a good [naturalistic] argument in the first\nplace, attribute failure to imperfect understanding of where an\norganism lives and what it does.\nNaturalism is a constitutive commitment that delimits possible objects of in-\nquiry. It is not itself empirically vindicated but, rather, has become a framework\nfor vindication. And if both theism and naturalism are taken to be inflexible, pre-\ntheoretical interpretive backgrounds, then the result, I suggest, is ontological\n342 MATTHEW RATCL I FFE\nand epistemological relativism. However, there is no in-principle reason why\na background of interpretation cannot be questioned. Why not see what happens\nto your interpretations of the biological world when you lower the naturalistic\ndefences and entertain God as a possible constituent of the experienceable world?\nHence, anybody who does not explicitly admit to operating wholly from within a\nmetaphysically atheistic research framework should open up the arena of debate\nto embrace the complex cycle of mutual illumination between empirical inves-\ntigation of worldly entities and different constitutive presuppositions concerning\nwhat the world is like. I do not champion the claim that God really speaks to\npeople during religious experiences, and neither do I recommend the adoption of\na theistic interpretive framework over an atheistic one. But I do think that both\npossibilities are worth investigating and that to do so will involve not merely\nempirical work but also acknowledgement of the hermeneutic dimensions of\nscience, of how scientific ontologies are constituted by interpretive stances.17\nReferences\nALBRIGHT, C.

As reported in Ramachandran et al. (1998), and Ramachandran and Blakeslee (1998).\n3. Ramachandran cites Slater and Beard (1963), Dewhurst and Beard (1970) and Trimble (1992) amongst\nothers.\n4. The reference cited is co-authored with Sandra Blakeslee. However, as the book is generally written\nin the first person singular, referring to work that Ramachandran has carried out, I refer exclusively to\nRamachandran when citing it in the text.\n5. As the limbic system is involved with production and regulation of emotional responses, generally\nenhanced activation of these pathways is likely to result in more pronounced emotional reactions\nto all stimuli, which are consequently perceived by the subject as imbued with significance.\n6. Albright (2000) criticizes Ramachandran\u2019s premature commitment to a specialized neural structure\nthat can be identified independent of a broader context of cortical activity. Albright emphasizes a more\nholistic, developmental perspective on the brain, challenging the assumptions that it is comprised of\na \u2018collection of unrelated modules\u2019 and that experience of God can \u2018be confined to a single sort of\nexperience, or to a module of the brain\u2019 (2000, 737).\n7. It may however make more sense from a thoroughgoing pragmatist point of view.\n8. See Ratcliffe (2002) for the view that emotions and moods are a pre-theoretical, world-disclosing cradle\nwithin which explicit, propositional cognition rests, disclosing a sense of reality that is more basic than\nthe objective world that the sciences take for granted. See also Ratcliffe (forthcoming) for a discussion\nof William James and the emotions.\n9. Selectionist accounts of function are surprisingly technical, distinguishing between a variety of different\nscenarios in order to insulate themselves against counter-examples. See for instance the essays by\n344 MATTHEW RATCL I FFE\nWright, Millikan, Neander, Griffiths, Godfrey-Smith, and Kitcher in Allen, Beckoff, and Lauder (eds)\n(1998). I do not agree with any such account. However, for current purposes, I assume that \u2018the function\nof A is x \u2019 is generally coincident with some variant along the lines of \u2018A exists\/persists because of\nselective factors favouring an ability to x \u2019.\n10. Gould and Vrba (1982) refer to a structure that was originally adapted to perform task y but was\nsubsequently adapted for x and now performs x but not y as an exaptation. There are plenty of other,\nsimilar terms referring to the same or similar historical scenarios floating around in the current\nliterature (e.g. Griffiths (1992) discusses \u2018exadaptation\u2019). Gould and Vrba restrict the term \u2018function\u2019 to\nthe structure\u2019s original role. However, it is more usual to regard the task that is currently the focus of\nselection pressures as the structure\u2019s function.\n11. Explanations (2)\u2013(5) can also be rephrased with A as part of B, as can (1)\u2013(4) below.\n12. This would be analogous to \u2018the function of the heart (A) is to pump the blood (x) and the reason that x\nis functional is that pumping the blood supplies the body with oxygen\u2019.\n13. As Dennett (1990, 188) puts it, \u2018one starts off with a naive understanding of the \u2018\u2018problem\u2019\u2019 faced by\nsome organism, and in terms of that naive understanding works out how the organism ought to be\ndesigned\u2019.\n14. This is evident in the writings of evolutionary psychologists such as Cosmides and Tooby (1992), who\nlook at what the mind currently does in order to extrapolate about the nature selection pressures with\nwhich we were confronted in the Pleistocene environment in which the mind evolved.\n15. See e.g. Husserl\u2019s (1970, Part 2) historical discussion of the origins of modern scientific objectivism.\nAccording to Husserl, the sense of modern objectivism rests on a sedimented and forgotten history of\naccomplishments, culminating in the achievements of Galileo and Descartes. These accomplishments\ntake the form of methodological innovations, which at the same time constitute their objects of study.\nAll draw their sense from the tacit, pre-given life-world.\n16. The fourth criterion, \u2018emphasize immediate utility and exclude other attributes of form\u2019, cannot be\nmade to apply here.\n17.
