Introduction\n[2] The electrical conductivity of the ionosphere is\nfundamentally important to the study of magnetosphere-\nionosphere coupling and therefore to that of energy flow in\nthe solar-terrestrial system. The conductivity arises in the\nlower ionosphere (D and E regions) where the increased\ncollision frequency primarily between ions and neutrals\npermits differential electron-ion drift under an imposed\nelectric field in the presence of the geomagnetic field. The\nionization in these regions comes from two main sources:\nsolar illumination at ultraviolet and X-ray wavelengths and\nthe impact of energetic electrons (and ions) from the\nmagnetosphere. The latter is especially important at high\nlatitudes where magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling cur-\nrents flow.\n[3] The conductivity is usually determined indirectly as\nthe relevant regions are difficult to access for in situ\nmeasurements. If the electron density is known, then the\nconductivity can be calculated from theory using model\nvalues for the ion-neutral collision frequencies. Electron\ndensity may be determined from instruments such as\nionosondes or incoherent scatter radars, but these suffer\nfrom limitations such as the inability to survey large areas\neither at all or on a short timescale compared to the\ntimescale on which the ionosphere changes significantly.\nFor large-scale studies the inversion of optical and X-ray\nmeasurements from space permits reconstruction of precip-\nitating particle fluxes and hence electron densities and\nconductivities [Aksnes et al., 2006]. On the medium scale,\nsimilar techniques can be applied to ground-based optical\ndata [Kosch et al., 1998, 2001; Janhunen, 2001; Partamies\net al., 2004; Ashrafi et al., 2005]. However, this approach\nsuffers from the severe limitation of requiring clear skies.\n[4] The imaging riometer [Detrick and Rosenberg, 1990]\nis a ground-based device which makes medium-scale mea-\nsurements of the ionospheric absorption of cosmic radio\nnoise at very high frequencies (\u000130 MHz). This absorption\nis a good indicator of D and E region ionization because of\nenergetic electron precipitation [Hargreaves, 1969]. Ab-\nsorption is determined by comparing the cosmic noise\npower received to the level expected in the absence of\nreductions due to precipitation enhancing the lower iono-\nsphere (a \u2018\u2018quiet day\u2019\u2019). As a result, the ionization due to\nsolar illumination is not detected. Since the electron precip-\nitation is also responsible for enhancing the conductivity, it\nis natural to seek relationships between cosmic noise\nabsorption (CNA) and conductivity once the solar ioniza-\ntion contribution to the latter has been taken into account.\nFurthermore, riometers unlike ground-based photometers\nand imagers, are able to operate regardless of cloud cover\nand daylight and can perform continuous monitoring.\n[5] Walker and Bhatnagar [1989] derived empirical rela-\ntionships between CNA and conductivities using statistical\nelectron density profiles determined for several values of\nCNA by Collis et al. [1984]. In this work the relationships\nbetween CNA and conductivity are investigated using\nsimultaneous measurements with a common ionospheric\nvolume from an imaging riometer and an incoherent scatter\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 112, A11301, doi:10.1029\/2007JA012519, 2007\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1Department of Communication Systems, Lancaster University, Lan-\ncaster, UK.\nCopyright 2007 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/07\/2007JA012519$09.00\nA11301 1 of 10\nradar. The latter is used to determine the conductivity from\nthe measured profiles of electron density. The results differ\nsignificantly from those of Walker and Bhatnagar [1989].\n2. Theory\n[6] The ionospheric absorption of cosmic radio noise at\nthe riometer angular frequency wR is given by the formulae\n[Hargreaves, 1969]\nA \u00bc\nZ\nNe a dz \u00f01\u00de\na \u00bc 4:6\u0005 10\n\u00065n\nn2 \u00fe wR \b we\u00f0 \u00de2\n; \u00f02\u00de\nwhere A is in dB, Ne is the electron number density in m\n\u00063,\nwe is the electron angular gyrofrequency, n is the electron\ncollision frequency, and a is known as the \u2018\u2018specific\nabsorption\u2019\u2019 and has units of dB m2, that is, absorption\nper unit electron density per unit altitude. The positive sign\nin the denominator of (2) corresponds to a O-mode wave\nand the negative sign to a X-mode wave, which riometers\nare frequently built to receive.\n[7] The ionospheric Pedersen and Hall conductances\nSH,P are the height-integrated (along the magnetic field)\nPedersen and Hall conductivities sH,P. The conductances\nare used since the conductivity parallel to the magnetic field\nis very high, and so the conductivity layers at different\naltitudes are effectively connected in parallel. Conductivity\ns is related to mobility m by s = Neem, where e is the\nelectronic charge. The conductances are then\nSH ;P \u00bc e\nZ\nNemH ;P dz; \u00f03\u00de\nwhere the mobilities are [Davies and Lester, 1999]\nmH \u00bc\n1\nB\nw2e\nn2en \u00fe w2e\n\u0006\nX\nj\nPj\nw2j\nn2jn \u00fe w2j\n !\n\u00f04\u00de\nmP \u00bc\n1\nB\nwenen\nn2en \u00fe w2e\n\u00fe\nX\nj\nPj\nwjnjn\nn2jn \u00fe w2j\n !\n; \u00f05\u00de\nwhere mH and mP are the Hall and Pedersen mobilities,\nrespectively; j refers to an ion species; wj is the\ngyrofrequency of ion species j; njn is the ion-neutral\ncollision frequency for ion species j; Pj is the relative\ndensity of ion species j; and B(z) is the geomagnetic flux\ndensity.\n[8] There is an obvious similarity between (1) and (3) in\nthat both take the form of a convolution of the electron\ndensity profile with a profile of some other parameter.\nNeglecting transport, the equilibrium electron density is\ngiven by Ne =\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nq=a\u00f0 \u00dep , where q is the ionization production\nrate and a is the effective recombination coefficient. In\nsection 1 it was explained that CNA does not include the\nionization contribution from solar radiation, so only the\ncontribution from particle impact is considered. Since the\nconductances certainly do include a contribution from solar\nionization, this contribution must be subtracted before\ncomparing them with CNA. This procedure is described\nin section 3.2. Now, neglecting solar radiation, q is propor-\ntional to the rate of energy deposition by precipitating\nparticles at each altitude [Rees, 1963]. It follows that the\nheight-integrated production rate is proportional to the\nintegral energy flux of the precipitation FE. Therefore, for\na given FE the height profile of q is determined by the shape\nof the precipitating particle flux-energy spectrum. Note that\nwith this definition of \u2018\u2018shape\u2019\u2019 two Maxwellian spectra with\ndifferent characteristic energies would have different\n\u2018\u2018shapes.\u2019\u2019\n[9] Now the integral number flux F is given by F = FE\/\u0001E,\nwhere \u0001E is the mean energy, a function of the shape of the\nspectrum. Thus it follows that q \/ FE = \u0001EF. Recalling that\nthe \u2018\u2018constant\u2019\u2019 of proportionality is a function of the\nspectrum shape and noting that to first order, \u0001E is a measure\nof this shape q = f (\u0001E)F, where f is some arbitrary spectrum-\nshape-dependent function. Thus we have Ne = f (\u0001E)F\n0.5 by\nthe equilibrium condition (where f is some other arbitrary\nfunction).\n[10] Since absorption and conductance are convolutions\ninvolving the electron density profile, it follows that they all\ntake the form P = f (\u0001E)F0.5, that is, they are all proportional\nto the square root of the integral number flux by some\nenergy-dependent factor, which differs from parameter to\nparameter. It also follows that ratios of the parameters, in\nparticular, SH\/SP are indicators of the energy. An important\nconsequence of this result is that although the conductances\nand CNA scale in the same way with changes in integral\nflux, they respond differently to changes in the spectrum\nshape (\u2018\u2018energy\u2019\u2019). This corresponds with intuition given\nthat the conductances and CNA are associated with different\naltitude intervals (SP \u0001 110\u2013130 km, SH \u0001 80\u2013110 km,\nCNA < 100 km) and thus with different parts of the flux-\nenergy spectrum (SP \u0001 2\u201310 keV, SH \u0001 5\u201350 keV, CNA >\n20 keV). Thus it is clear that there will not be a one-one\nrelationship between CNA and conductance, but rather it\nwill be of a statistical nature depending on changes in the\nspectrum shape.\n3. Experimental Data\n3.1. Instrumentation\n[11] In this study, CNA measurements are taken from the\nimaging riometer for ionospheric studies (IRIS) at Kilpis-\nja\u00a8rvi, Finland (69.05\u0001N, 20.79\u0001E) [Browne et al., 1995].\nA statistical study of IRIS measurements was given by\nKavanagh et al. [2004]. The conductances are calculated\nfrom measurements taken using the European Incoherent\nScatter (EISCAT) UHF radar [Rishbeth and van Eyken,\n1993] located near Troms\u00f8, Norway (69.58\u0001N, 19.23\u0001E).\nThe radar data are taken from Common Program One (CP-1)\noperations where the beam is directed along the magnetic\nfield. Davies and Lester [1999] presented statistics of con-\nductances determined from similar measurements. The riom-\neter beam (referred to as beam 16), which intersects the radar\nbeam at an altitude of 90 km, was chosen for the absorption\nmeasurements. The riometer operates at a frequency of\n38.2 MHz. Both the radar and riometer measurements were\nA11301 SENIOR ET AL.: RADIO ABSORPTION AND CONDUCTANCES\n2 of 10\nA11301\nintegrated over 60 s intervals. The riometer has a basic time\nresolution of 1 s, and the radar has a basic time resolution of\n5 s. These shorter integrations would be more appropriate to\nthe rapidly-changing auroral conditions, but the measure-\nment variance for the radar data would become very large.\nIdeally, the CNA and conductance should be compared when\nboth are steady state to avoid inconsistencies due to their\ndiffering response times to precipitation (the recombination\ntime). This was investigated by using 5 s resolution CNA data\nto eliminate 60 s integrations where the CNA was highly\nvariable during the integration time, but removing these\nintegrations was not found to greatly influence the results.\n3.2. Data Selection and Preparation\n[12] Data from 29 days between 2002 and 2006 on which\nthe UHF radar ran the CP-1 mode were selected for analysis\n(Table 1). The days were selected to give as close to\n24-h coverage as possible in both the radar and riometer\ndata. Data from 9\u201313 November 2004 were not used\nbecause of a solar proton event. Energetic proton precipita-\ntion enhances CNA but produces ionization at altitudes too\nlow to significantly affect the conductances. The distribu-\ntion of data points by magnetic local time (MLT) is shown\nin Figure 1. MLT \n UT + 2.5 h at Troms\u00f8 and this\napproximate relationship is used throughout this study.\nThe reduced occurrence in the 0400\u20130800 and 1700\u2013\n2100 MLT intervals is due to the omission of periods where\nthe riometer measurement was affected by scintillation in\nthe October 2002 and March\/April 2006 data sets, respec-\ntively (see later). Consequently, these time sectors are\nbiased toward the March\/April 2006 and October 2002 data\nsets, respectively.\n[13] The UHF radar spectra were analysed at 60-s\nresolution using the Grand Unified Incoherent Scatter\nDesign and Analysis Package (GUISDAP) [Lehtinen and\nHuuskonen, 1996]. As fitting the spectrum is an under-\ndetermined problem, certain standard assumptions are\nmade about some parameters. The ion composition is\nassumed rather than fitted at all heights. Above 107 km\nthe electron\/ion temperature ratio is fitted and the ion-\nneutral collision frequency held constant. Below 107 km\nthe reverse situation applies with the electron\/ion temper-\nature ratio taken equal to \u00011.1. The electron density, ion\ntemperature, and line-of-sight ion drift velocity are fitted at\nall heights.\nTable 1.

Distribution of data used in this study by magnetic local time.\nA11301 SENIOR ET AL.: RADIO ABSORPTION AND CONDUCTANCES\n3 of 10\nA11301\n[14] Since the analysis of the incoherent scatter ion line\nonly determines the electron density up to a scale factor, the\nelectron densities were calibrated by comparing the peak F\nregion density in each profile against the corresponding fOF2\nvalue from the EISCAT dynasonde ionospheric sounder. This\ncalibration is valid for the whole altitude range. The resulting\nplasma parameters were filtered to exclude obviously non-\nphysical fits (e.g., negative temperatures, electron densities\nor ion-neutral collision frequencies, or electron densities\nexceeding 1013 m\u00063 which probably indicate backscatter\nfrom space debris or satellites).\n[15] For each altitude profile the Pedersen and Hall\nconductivities were computed for each altitude gate using\n(3\u20135). The ion-neutral collision frequencies were calculated\nusing the formulae of Schunk and Walker [1973], and the\nelectron-neutral collision frequency was calculated using\nthe formula of Schunk and Nagy [1978]. The MSISE-90 and\nIRI-2001 models were run for each time point to give the\nneutral densities and ion composition. The ion and electron\ntemperatures were taken from the radar data. The conduc-\ntivities were filtered to remove nonphysical negative values\nwhich can result from unrealistically high ion or electron\ntemperatures from the radar analysis being used in the\ncollision frequency formulae. Altitude profiles having fewer\nthan 50% of range gates containing valid data were excluded\nfrom further analysis. This reduces the number of very noisy\nestimates of the conductances but introduces some slight bias\nsince profiles having very low electron densities (and thus\npoor radar signal-to-noise ratios) are likely to be lost. The\nconductivities were then integrated over the altitude range\n85\u2013200 km, according to (3) to give the conductances.\n[16] Since the riometer only measures the CNA because\nof enhanced particle precipitation, the solar ionization\ncontribution to the conductances was subtracted. In princi-\nple the ionization production rate due to solar ionization\nshould be subtracted from the total production rate. In\nequilibrium and under the assumption of an a-type recom-\nbination model the production rate is q = aNe\n2. Since\nconductance is S \/ Ne, it follows that the subtraction\nbecomes S* =\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nS2 \u0006 S2S\nq\n, where S is the total conduc-\ntance, S* is the conductance due to particle precipitation,\nand SS is the conductance due to solar ionization (strictly,\nsince conductances are height-integrated, one should work\nwith conductivities). In this study, SS comes from the\nempirical models of Brekke and Hall [1988] which are\nfunctions of solar zenith angle. However, Brekke et al.\n[1989] pointed out that the form of these models is not\nconsistent with the simple picture of a-type recombination\nand hence preferred simply to subtract the conductances\ndirectly, that is, S* = S \u0006 SS. This direct subtraction is\nadopted in this study.\n[17] At a final stage of filtering, values of the conductan-\nces and their ratio lying more than 4 standard deviations\nfrom the mean of each daily data set were excluded to avoid\n\u2018\u2018wild\u2019\u2019 values from distorting the statistics. This filtering\nwas intended to remove remaining anomalous data points\nresulting from technical problems with the radar and reflec-\ntions from satellites which were not removed in the earlier\nprocessing. Inevitably, there is a risk that some valid data\nwere removed just as there is that some invalid data were\nnot. Additionally, for the conductance ratio only, points\nhaving estimated standard errors greater than 0.5 were\nrejected. This mitigates the problem described by Brekke\nand Hall [1988] where subtracting the solar contribution to\nthe conductance causes the estimate of the ratio to become\nnoisy, for example, if the corrected SP is close to zero.\n[18] The CNA data from beam 16 of IRIS were averaged\nto 60-second resolution. Periods where ionospheric scintil-\nlation was present were removed. For each day listed in\nTable 1 the data were shifted by an offset to compensate for\ninaccuracy in the estimated quiet day absorption level. Just\nunder half of these offsets were zero, but one was as large as\n0.25 dB (23 September 2003). The offsets were obtained by\ninspection of daily line plots of absorption. This method\nobviously does not allow for an offset which varies during a\ngiven day. Finally, CNA values less than \u00060.5 dB, which\nare likely to be the result of interference, were excluded.\n3.3. Results\n[19] Figure 2 shows occurrence plots of the Hall conduc-\ntance versus CNA, as a function of magnetic local time\ninterval. The intervals were chosen by inspecting scatter\nplots of the data over shorter periods of MLT in order to\ndetermine the intervals over which the distribution was\nreasonably constant. Four main populations of data points\nwere found, corresponding to the intervals 1900\u20130400,\n0400\u20131000, 1000\u20131500, and 1500\u20131900 MLT. The\n1900\u20130400 and 1000\u20131500 MLT populations are clearly\nquite different. During the intervening interval 0400\u20131000\nMLT the distribution gradually alters from that of 1900\u2013\n0400 to that of 1000\u20131500 MLT and this interval (0400\u2013\n1000 MLT) has been subdivided into three 2-h intervals in\nFigure 2. In the 1500\u20131900 MLT interval, there is very little\nenhancement of Hall conductance or CNA.\n[20] This classification has been adopted for the data\nanalysis since the four main populations correspond well\nwith what might be expected from the physical processes\nunderlying the particle precipitation. The 1900\u20130400 MLT\ninterval coincides with the interval where substorms occur,\ninjecting particles directly on to the field lines within the\ninstruments\u2019 field of view [Baker et al., 1981; Thomsen et\nal., 2001]. In the interval 1000\u20131500 MLT the precipitation\ncomes mainly from energetic electrons gradient-curvature\ndrifting eastward from substorm injection at earlier MLTs\n[Jelly and Brice, 1967; Roederer, 1967; Hargreaves, 1968;\nHargreaves and Devlin, 1990]. The intervening interval\n0400\u20131000 MLT then contains a mixture of precipitation\nfrom local substorms and from drifting electrons. Satellite\nobservations [Collis et al., 1984; Hardy et al., 1985] have\nshown that the precipitation spectrum becomes progressively\nharder with increasing MLT, at least until about 0900 MLT,\nalthough bremsstrahlung X-ray measurements [Bewersdorff\net al., 1966; Kodama et al., 1995] suggest that the hardening\ncontinues toward dusk. In the final interval 1500\u20131900MLT,\nvery little enhancement of CNA or the conductances occurs.\nThis interval has long been known to be a minimum in\nprecipitation as detected by CNA [Brown, 1966;Hargreaves,\n1969].\n3.4. Measurement Uncertainties\n[21] There are a number of factors which contribute to\nuncertainties in the measurements. Considering the riometer\ndata, the random error in the 60 s integrated data is small,\nA11301 SENIOR ET AL.: RADIO ABSORPTION AND CONDUCTANCES\n4 of 10\nA11301\nhaving a standard deviation of about 0.01 dB, rising to\n0.1 dB during very rapidly varying absorption or scintilla-\ntion, although periods of scintillation have been excluded\nhere. This is small compared to the range of absorption\nvalues observed. On the other hand, systematic errors result\nfrom inaccurate estimation of the quiet day level, that is, the\ncosmic noise power received in the absence of precipitation\nenhancing the D region electron density. These systematic\nerrors are on the order of 0.2 dB. As described earlier, the\nCNA data have been adjusted to reduce this error, but it is\ndifficult to completely eliminate it. An error of 0.2 dB is\nrather large compared to the range of absorption measured.\n[22] In the case of the radar data the main source of\nuncertainty is the random error associated ultimately with\nthe signal-to-noise ratio of the plasma spectrum measure-\nment. The uncertainties of the plasma parameters are\nestimated by the analysis software. The parameters used\nin calculating the conductances are the electron density and\nthe electron and ion temperatures. The temperatures affect\nthe result in a relatively complicated manner, but the effect\nof uncertainty in the electron density is easier to estimate\nand on the basis of this 94% (77%) of the Hall conductances\nand 98% (90%) of the Pedersen conductances have errors\nless than 10% (5%).\n[23] Systematic errors can arise because of the failure of\nthe assumptions made in the radar analysis and calculation\nof the conductances. For example, if the model ion com-\nposition does not reflect reality, the temperatures obtained\nfrom the radar analysis will be incorrect, as will the collision\nfrequencies used in calculating the conductivities. Such a\nsituation can arise, for example, during ion frictional heating\nbecause of strong electric fields, leading to an increase in\nthe proportion of molecular ions in the lower F region. In\nthe E region the same electric fields can excite the Farley-\nBuneman instability leading to electron heating, violating\nthe assumption that the electron\/ion temperature ratio is\nfixed below 107 km [Davies and Robinson, 1997]. This\nsame phenomenon has also been found to affect CNA\n[Stauning, 1984].\n[24] An additional source of error results from the differ-\nent fields of view of the riometer and radar. The radar beam\nhas a width of approximately 0.6\u0001 and is directed at a zenith\nangle of 13\u0001 through the ionosphere. On the other hand, the\nriometer beam chosen has a width of about 12\u0001 and passes\nmore obliquely through the ionosphere (zenith angle of 33\u0001).\nThe two instruments thus integrate over very different but\nintersecting volumes of plasma. The intersection of the\nbeams varies with altitude and therefore with changes in\nthe hardness of the precipitating electron spectrum. Further-\nmore, if there is small-scale structure in the precipitation\n(which is certainly observed in optical images of the aurora),\nthen this will also lead to discrepancies between the radar and\nriometer measurements. Unfortunately, it is almost impossi-\nble to estimate this type of error quantitatively.\n3.5. Statistical Models\n[25] In order to have a convenient method by which to\nmake statistical predictions of conductance parameters from\nCNA, models of the form\nmY \u00bc\nc : A < A0\nm A\u0006 A0\u00f0 \u00dep\u00fe c : A \u000b A0\n8<\n: \u00f06\u00de\nhave been fitted to the data, where A is CNA in dB; m, c,\nand p are arbitrary nonnegative constants; Y is the response\nvariable (Hall or Pedersen conductance or the Hall\/Pedersen\nconductance ratio); and mY is its mean. As noted earlier,\nthere is no simple theoretical basis on which to expect a\nparticular functional form for the relationship between the\nconductance parameters and absorption and so the choice of\nthis power law form was based on a number of factors. The\ndata suggest monotonic relationships and when plotted on a\nlog-log scale (not shown) are roughly linear. The constant\nterm c allows for the possibility that the conductance (or\nFigure 2. Occurrence plots of Hall conductance versus CNA for six intervals of magnetic local time.\nThe intensity of shading represents the proportion of the total number of points (the relative frequency) in\neach bin. The dashed curves are the means of the fitted models. The MLT intervals are indicated.\nA11301 SENIOR ET AL.: RADIO ABSORPTION AND CONDUCTANCES\n5 of 10\nA11301\nratio) remains nonzero even when CNA is zero and was\nagain suggested by the data. The constant offset A0 allows\nfor residual bias in the CNA data due to the type of quiet\nday level uncertainty described in section 3.4. The model\nwas fitted to the data for each MLT interval (excluding\n1500\u20131900 MLT). The distribution of the response Y was\ntaken as a gamma distribution since the response can\ntheoretically only take nonnegative values. Further details\nof the models and the coefficients of the fits are given in\nAppendix A.\n[26] Figures 2\u20134 show the distribution of all the data\npoints (not just those included in the fits) and the means of\nthe fitted models for each MLT interval. The performance of\nthe fits are measured by the R2 statistic (see Tables A1\u2013A3\nin Appendix A). On the whole, the Pedersen conductance is\nleast well explained by the CNA, the only exception being\nthe 0600\u20130800 MLT interval when the Hall\/Pedersen ratio\nis worse. This may be due to the cluster of points with SH\/\nSP > 5 for A < 1 dB. The Hall conductance is most well\nexplained by CNA in all MLT intervals, although the Hall\/\nPedersen ratio is only slightly worse except for 0600\u2013\n0800 MLT (as already discussed above) and also 0400\u2013\n0600 MLT when the Hall conductance is particularly well\nexplained, possibly a side effect of the smaller number of\ndata points in this interval.\n4. Discussion\n[27] The results show that Hall conductance is more\nstrongly related to CNA than Pedersen conductance. This\nresult might have been expected on intuitive grounds since\nthe energy ranges of precipitating particles causing the Hall\nconductance region and the CNA region are closer in\naltitude than those causing the Pedersen conductance and\nCNA regions. What is more surprising is the apparent\nstrong relation between the conductance ratio and CNA,\nsince the conductance ratio is dependent purely on the\nFigure 3. Same as for Figure 2 but for Pedersen conductance versus CNA.\nFigure 4. Same as for Figure 2 but for the Hall\/Pedersen conductance ratio versus CNA.\nA11301 SENIOR ET AL.: RADIO ABSORPTION AND CONDUCTANCES\n6 of 10\nA11301\nenergy of the precipitation whereas CNA depends on both\nthe energy and the flux.\n[28] Figure 5 shows Pedersen and Hall conductances,\ntheir ratio, and CNA computed for Maxwellian electron\nspectra of different mean energy \u0001E for the same energy flux\nFE = 1 mW m\n\u00062. Fluxes isotropic in pitch angle are\nassumed. Similar model results for conductances were given\nby Vickrey et al. [1981] and for CNA by Mori et al. [2004].\nThe presentation in terms of constant energy flux follows\nthe previous authors but means that the energy dependence\nof the parameters is not shown explicitly [Vickrey et al.,\n1981; Mori et al., 2004]; since FE = \u0001EF, the number flux F\nfalls in inverse proportion to mean energy \u0001E, and since, as\ndiscussed earlier, the parameters are proportional to F0.5, the\nenergy dependence is reduced by a factor of \u0001E0.5. The gray\ncurves in Figure 5 have slopes corresponding to power law\nindices of 0.5 and 1.5. These in turn correspond to explicit\npower law energy dependencies with indices of 1 and 2,\nrespectively. Thus it is seen that over nearly the whole\nenergy range 1 < \u0001E < 50 keV, CNA is approximately\nproportional to \u0001E2 whereas the energy dependencies of SP\nand SH are much weaker. It seems likely that the strong\nassociation between CNA and SH\/SP is a result of this\nstrong energy dependence of CNA which dominates its\ndependence on changes in the number flux of precipitating\nelectrons. From Figure 5, SH\/SP varies roughly as \u0001E over\nmost of the energy range. Robinson et al. [1987] found SH\/\nSP \/ \u0001E0.85. Since CNA varies as \u0001E2, it might be expected\nthat SH\/SP will vary as A\n0.5 and indeed the power law index\nin the statistical SH\/SP-CNA models is not far from 0.5,\nwith the exception of the 0400\u20130600 MLT interval\n(Table A3).\n[29] A marked contrast between the SH-CNA and SH\/SP-\nCNA relationships is their MLT dependence. The MLT\ndependence of the former is the basis for the MLT classi-\nfication used in this study. However, it is clear that the latter\nhas a much weaker if it has any MLT dependence. This can\nbe explained in terms of how the typical energy of precip-\nitating electrons varies with MLT. As remarked on earlier, in\nthe 1900\u20130400 MLT interval the precipitation is dominated\nby local substorm activity. Here the electron fluxes tend to\nbe relatively soft. Moving toward later local times, the\nfluxes become progressively dominated by electrons gradi-\nent-curvature drifting eastward (dawnward) from substorm\ninjection and these are observed to become progressively\nharder with MLT [Bewersdorff et al., 1966; Hardy et al.,\n1985]. In particular, the satellite measurements presented by\nCollis et al. [1984] support the idea that the energy\nspectrum hardens in this way and indeed their results agree\nquite well with the classification into MLT intervals used in\nthis study.\n[30] Assuming that the underlying SH\/SP-CNA relation-\nship is constant (strictly it is a function of the atmospheric\nresponse to precipitation), then the observed relationship\nwill not change either, except that there will tend to be more\noccurrences of high SH\/SP at later MLTs as the mean\nenergy increases, and Figure 4 supports this. This increase\nof mean energy can also explain the change in the SH-CNA\nrelationship with MLT. CNA increases much faster with\nmean energy than SH for a given number flux so that a given\nCNA tends to correspond to a lower SH at later MLTs.\n[31] Relationships between CNA and the Hall and Ped-\nersen conductances were previously derived by Walker and\nBhatnagar [1989]. They found nearly linear relationships\nbetween the Hall and Pedersen conductances and CNA,\ncontrasting with the present power law relationships where\nthe power law index is less than unity. Figure 6 compares\nthe models of Walker and Bhatnagar [1989] with those of\nthis work. The Walker and Bhatnagar [1989] models were\ngiven in terms of CNA at 30 MHz whereas here 38.2 MHz\nis used. The CNA at 30 MHz was scaled to that at 38.2 MHz\nassuming it is inversely proportional to the square of the\nfrequency as implied by magnetoionic theory (2). It is clear\nfrom Figure 6 that there is a considerable difference\nbetween the two sets of models for both the Hall and\nFigure 5.

The CNA values have been\nmultiplied by 10. The gray curves show how power law\nfunctions with indices of 0.5 (shallow slope) and 1.5 (steep\nslope) would appear on the plot.\nFigure 6. Comparison of the conductance-CNA relation-\nships of Walker and Bhatnagar [1989] (solid curves) with\nthose of this work (dashed curves) from all magnetic local\ntime sectors ((left) Hall conductance; (right) Pedersen\nconductance). The CNA is for a frequency of 38.2 MHz.\nA11301 SENIOR ET AL.: RADIO ABSORPTION AND CONDUCTANCES\n7 of 10\nA11301\nPedersen conductances. The models match most closely for\nthe 1900\u20130600 MLT interval, but even there the difference\ncan be a factor of 2 or more. The variation with MLT in the\npresent results is considerable and shows that a single model\ncannot be used for all MLTs.\n[32] The Walker and Bhatnagar [1989] models were\nbased on electron density profiles compiled for several\ndifferent values of CNA by Collis et al. [1984]. These\nprofiles were not measured but computed from spacecraft\nmeasurements of precipitating electron spectra at geosta-\ntionary orbit. Furthermore, these calculations included data\nfrom all MLTs and are, as the authors pointed out, subject to\nconsiderable uncertainty in the effective recombination\ncoefficient [Collis et al., 1984]. As noted earlier in this\nsection and section 3.3, the spacecraft data presented by\nCollis et al. [1984] show that there is significant variation in\nthe typical energy of electron precipitation with MLT and\ntherefore significant variation in the shape of the\ncorresponding electron density profile with MLT. It may\nbe that averaging over these variations resulted in unrealistic\nelectron density profiles and hence unrealistic values for the\nPedersen and Hall conductances. In addition, Walker and\nBhatnagar [1989] had to extrapolate the profiles to higher\naltitudes to fully cover the conductance region. In contrast,\nthe relationships given here are based on direct comparison\nof CNA with measured electron density profiles and have\nbeen separated by MLT.\n[33] Makarevitch et al. [2004] presented an interval of\nsimultaneous EISCAT CP-1 and IRIS riometer measure-\nments and established relationships between the Hall con-\nductance and CNA during this interval, which covered the\nperiod \u00010630\u20131330 MLT (0400\u20131100 UT). A simple\nproportionality, SH = CHA was used, but they found it\nnecessary to change the constant CH from 29.0 for the\ninterval 0630\u20131030 MLT to 15.5 for the interval 1030\u2013\n1330 MLT, i.e., in the latter interval, a given CNA corre-\nsponded to a smaller Hall conductance. This behavior is\nqualitatively consistent with the statistical models given\nhere. It so happens in this example that the transition\noccurred close to the boundary between two of the MLT\nintervals used here (1000 MLT), but, in general, such\nboundaries are not likely to be adhered to. Indeed, it is\npossible to see from Figure 7 of Makarevitch et al. [2004]\nsome sub-intervals when the correlation between SH and\nCNA is poorer than in others and these are probably due to\ntemporally localized variations in the typical energy of the\nelectron precipitation. Such variations cannot be taken into\naccount by the statistical models and demonstrate a limita-\ntion of using them to predict conductances. Indeed, since\nthe models are probability models, it does not follow that if\nthe same absorption is observed at two different times or\nlocations that the conductance must be the same at these two\ninstances but rather that the probability distribution of the\nconductance is the same.\n[34] The data set used in this study mostly contains\nmeasurements made in the equinoctial seasons, with a small\ncontribution from summer. It is known that CNA exhibits a\nstrong seasonal variation, being greatest in the equinoctial\nseasons and lower in summer than in winter [Ranta et al.,\n1983]. To a large extent, this corresponds to the long known\nseasonal variation in geomagnetic activity. Russell and\nMcPherron [1973] proposed an explanation in terms of\nsouthward component of the interplanetary magnetic field\nseen by the magnetosphere as a function of the Sun-Earth\ngeometry. More recently, it has been suggested that solar\nillumination of the polar regions may play an important role\n[Lyatsky et al., 2001]. In the latter case, in particular, the\nseasonal variation may involve seasonal changes in the\ntypical shape of the precipitating electron spectra [Liou et\nal., 2001] leading to changes in the form of the CNA-\nconductance relationships, rather than simply affecting the\noccurrence probability of precipitation events. Investigation\nof these effects is beyond the scope of this study.\n[35] It should also be borne in mind that the relationships\npresented in this study are derived using measurements\ntaken in the auroral zone. At much higher or lower latitudes\nit is possible that the relationships would be different\nbecause of the different characteristics of particle precipita-\ntion. For example, at higher latitudes, precipitation associ-\nated with the magnetospheric cusps would occur around\nlocal noon and the precipitation associated with gradient-\nTable A1.

Conclusion\n[36] Statistical models for the Hall and Pedersen conduc-\ntances and their ratio as functions of cosmic noise absorp-\ntion at 38.2 MHz have been derived for five intervals of\nmagnetic local time. The Hall conductance and the conduc-\ntance ratio have the strongest associations with CNA and\nthe Pedersen conductance is weakly related to CNA. The\nHall conductance-CNA relationship is a strong function of\nMLT and this has been interpreted in terms of the change in\nthe typical energy of precipitating electrons as they drift\neastward from substorm injection. On the other hand, the\nconductance ratio has a relationship to CNAwhich is almost\nindependent of local time. The results have been compared\nto the previous models of Walker and Bhatnagar [1989] and\nfound to differ considerably, probably because that study\ndid not take the MLT dependence into account. It is\nemphasized that the statistical nature of the models pre-\nsented in this study should be borne in mind when applying\nthem since spatially or temporally localized features in the\nelectron precipitation will not be fully accounted for.\nAppendix A: Statistical Models\n[37] In fitting the model for the mean response (SH, SP,\nor SH\/SP) in terms of CNA given by (6) an appropriate\nprobability distribution for the response must be chosen.\nThe conventional choice of a normal distribution was\nconsidered to be unsatisfactory for two reasons. First, it is\nunphysical since it allows negative values for parameters\nwhich can only be nonnegative, and second, for SH and SP\nin particular, it tended to produce negative values for the\nmean (through the constant term in (6)) at low values of\nCNA. Indeed, at low values of CNA the distributions of the\nconductances are highly asymmetric with a tail toward\nhigher values. A potentially better candidate is the gamma\ndistribution, which is sometimes encountered within the\nframework of Generalized Linear Models [McCullagh and\nNelder, 1989]. The gamma density function is\nf x\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc 1\nG a\u00f0 \u00deb\n\u0006axa\u00061e\u0006x=b; \u00f0A1\u00de\nthe mean is m = ab, and the variance is s2 = ab2, where a,\nb > 0.\n[38] Conventionally, the response variance in a gamma\nmodel is proportional to the square of the response mean. In\nthis data set this leads to overestimation of the variance as\nCNA increases. Therefore a modified gamma model with\nthe variance proportional to the mean s2 = km was adopted\n(in fact, k = b with the parametrization of the gamma\ndensity). In some cases a constant variance might have\nbeen more appropriate. The model was fitted by maximizing\nthe likelihood of the observed data with respect to all\nthe model parameters, that is, the coefficients in (6)\nand the variance coefficient k. The maximization was con-\nstrained to avoid negative values of the coefficients in (6),\nexcept for A0. Only data points with positive values of\nSP, SH, or SH\/SP were included in the fit. This excluded\nonly a small number of points having negative values due to\nthe subtraction of the solar ionization contribution to the\nconductances.\n[39] Tables A1\u2013A3 give the parameters of the fits and\ntheir estimated uncertainties (1 standard deviation). The\npredictive powers of the fits are measured by the R2 statistic\n(coefficient of determination)\nR2 \u00bc 1\u0006\nX\nyi \u0006 mY Ai\u00f0 \u00de\u00bd \r2=\nX\nyi \u0006 \u0001y\u00f0 \u00de2; \u00f0A2\u00de\nwhere the subscript i ranges over each data point, \u0001y is the\nmean of all response values, and R2 can be thought of as the\nproportion of the variance in the conductance (or ratio)\nwhich can be explained by the fit. Clearly, the closer this is\nto unity, the more predictive is the CNA of the conductance.\n[40] When the fitting was repeated using a normal distri-\nbution, it was found that, broadly speaking, the fitted means\nwere not greatly different. However, the detail of the fit for\nA \n 0 was different between the two cases, in the manner\ndescribed above. On the whole it was felt that the gamma\ndistribution gave more plausible results.\n[41] Acknowledgments.
