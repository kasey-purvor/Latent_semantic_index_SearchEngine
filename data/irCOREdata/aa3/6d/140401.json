INTRODUCTION \nIn the area of optical fiber sensing, FBGs have been demonstrated to be the most promising mechanical probe for several \nresearch fields and applications. For this purpose, different interrogation systems have been developed so far, mostly \nbased on broad-emission radiation sources combined to optical spectrum analyzers and filters. More recently, \nsophisticated schemes based on laser sources and frequency stabilization methods were devised, achieving \nunprecedented sensitivity levels for dynamic strain monitoring [1]. Among them, a significant contribution came also \nfrom the use of FBG-based resonant structures whose highly-dispersive power near resonance is exploited to measure \nsub-n\u03b5 perturbations in a wide range of acoustic frequencies [2, 3]. However, in most such cases, low-acoustic frequency \ndetection is affected by temperature cross-sensitivity effects that may limit the ultimate  measurement accuracy. That is \nparticularly relevant for field applications where a robust and reliable operation is required. A number of solutions have \nbeen proposed to avoid such limitation, including reference sensors, two-wavelengths FBGs, chirped gratings and \nbirefringent fibers but often with serious degradation of the measurement precision [4]. In this work, we combine the \nadvantages of recently-developed techniques that improve strain detection sensitivity, by means of laser-spectroscopic \nmethods, to the use of FBG structures fabricated in high-birefringence (Panda) fibers. We describe the proposed \nmethods, the experimental set-ups and the preliminary results obtained by a single FBG sensor and an in-fiber Fabry-\nP\u00e9rot (FFP). \n2.   METHODOLOGY \nA scheme of the interrogation set-up used for a Panda FBG is shown in figure 1. A distributed feedback (DFB) diode \nlaser (1) and an extended-cavity diode laser (2), both equipped with single-mode Panda-fiber pig-tails, are used. The \nlasers are driven by highly-stable current and temperature controls, and their linear states of polarization (SOP) are \naligned to the fiber slow and fast axes, respectively. Laser 1 is frequency modulated at f1 = 2 GHz while laser 2 is \nmodulated at f2 = 1 GHz and both are coupled to the FBG through a PM 3-dB splitter.

Since the HiBi-FBG \nreflected signal presents two distinct peaks for slow and fast SOPs, they are first separated by a polarization splitter and \nthen detected by two different photodiodes. A double-balanced mixer (DBM) demodulates the detector signals at \nfrequency f1,2 and extracts a dispersive-like signal resulting from sideband-carrier frequency beating. With this in mind, \nif the laser is perfectly resonant with the FBG, the mixer provides a voltage signal crossing zero in correspondence of the \nmaximum reflectivity. Laser 1 and 2 give rise to mixer signals centered at slightly different wavelengths as a \nconsequence of the fiber polarization-mode dispersion (~ 0.5 nm). An example can be observed in figure 2. In our \ntechnique, these signals are used as frequency discriminator (error) to stabilize the frequency of the lasers on the two \nBragg peaks. This is accomplished by home-made proportional-integrative electronic loops (servo), which control laser \ncurrent and external cavity using error signals as a reference. By active locking of each laser, the correction signals serve \nas strain monitors. \n0 10 20 30 40 50 60\n-0.10\n-0.05\n0.00\n0.05\n0.10\nEr\nro\nr s\nig\nna\nl (\nV\nol\nt)\nFrequency scan (GHz)\nFig. 2. Mixer output lineshapes around the PM FBG \npeaks for a 45\u00b0 incident polarization. \nIn our set-up, we could apply both longitudinal strain (\u03b5L) to the grating by a piezo-electric transducer (PZT) that \nstretched the fiber and transverse strain (\u03b5T) by pressing on the FBG length along the slow fiber axis by a test machine. \nThe latter allowed to exert an evenly-distributed pressure between two glass surfaces in contact with the fiber. The actual \nmechanical deformations in all directions could be readily calibrated using a reference single-mode FBG, whose gauge \nfactor was preliminary measured by applying known weights. Temperature variations (\u2206T) could also be imposed to the \nfiber by means of a Peltier element in thermal contact with the FBG, the temperature being controlled by a PID stabilizer \n(resolution \u00a7 0.01 \u00b0C) and measured by an AD590 probe. Once the lasers were locked to the reflection peaks, for a given \nthermal or mechanical perturbation, we analyzed the corresponding changes in the servo feedback signal and retrieved \nthe response of the PM FBG. By comparing all calibrations to the correction signal voltage, we obtained the final \nresponse factors of the system to the measurands, i.e. \u03b5L, \u03b5T and \u2206T, yielded by the two crossed-polarized lasers. Our \nmethod points out the possibility to interrogate simultaneously orthogonal axes of HiBi FBG sensors which can be of \nsignificance to applications in the measurement of multiple physical parameters. A similar but slightly more complicated \nprocedure was employed for interrogation of the FFP. The instrumental arrangement is analogous to figure 1 while the \nFBG sensor is replaced by an in-fiber FBG resonator. Two high-reflectivity, Panda FBGs are coupled to form a Fabry-\nP\u00e9rot structure. The Bragg mirrors are separated by about 50 cm and closed in aluminum cylinders to keep them \nmechanically insensitive. Here the sensitive element is represented by the intra-cavity fiber and thus small strain signals \nare excited by a PZT placed between the cylinders. Since the cavity has a nominal finesse exceeding 1000, even tiny \neffects affecting the fiber are strongly amplified, so that its intrinsic strain sensitivity is significantly increased [3]. In this \ncase, the fiber birefringence plays a different role: each transmission resonance corresponding to a cavity mode is \nactually twofold if the incident SOP is not perfectly oriented along one of the principal axes. Static and dynamic \ndeformations as well as thermal effects on the fiber results in changes of the optical pathlength and thus frequency shifts \nof the resonances, with different responses along the principal axes. As in the scheme described above, the lasers are \nlocked to crossed-polarized peaks using the so-called Pound-Drever-Hall method [5]. According to considerations made \nabove, each cavity resonance is split in a \u201cslow\u201d and a \u201cfast\u201d mode because the natural degeneracy of Fabry-P\u00e9rot \nresonator is removed by the fiber anisotropy. Hence, the signals that drive the locking circuits are very similar to the case \nshown in figure 2.

This is a significant simplification, since for our purpose it is \nsufficient that the sidebands are separated by a cavity linewidth to obtain a suitable error signal. Strain-induced shifts of \nthe \u201cslow\u201d and \u201cfast\u201d resonances are monitored by the corrections generated by the servo loops and sent to the lasers. \nThe calibration procedure can be implemented in the same manner as for a single sensor, provided a reference FBG is \nused for strain-to-voltage conversion. \n3.   RESULTS \nMeasurements with the single sensor have been carried out so far applying longitudinal loads by the PZT. In figure 3, \nlinear fits to the graphs give longitudinal strain sensitivities of 1.264 \u00b1 0.02 pm\/\u00b5\u03b5 and 1.282 \u00b1 0.009 pm\/\u00b5\u03b5 for the slow and \nfast axes, respectively. Temperature sensitivities obtained for the same FBG were 10.326 \u00b1 0.02 pm\/oC and 11.858 \u00b1 0.2 pm\/oC\nfor the slow and fast axes respectively (Figure 4). The results for longitudinal strain sensitivity of the HiBi FBG are barely \ndistinguishable while temperatures are significantly different. Noise effects that limit measurement accuracy, e.g. \nspurious optical reflections, can be significantly reduced by using optical components with better anti-reflection \ncoatings. Application experiments for this technique to the measurement of strain (longitudinal and transverse) and \ntemperature, in both dynamic and static modes, have been performed and the results are currently being analysed and \nwill be presented elsewhere. \n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\n350\n400\n0 62 124 186 248 310\nStrain (\u00b5\u03b5)\nW\nav\nel\nen\ngt\nh \nsh\nift\n (p\nm\n)\nFig. 3: Longitudinal strain response for PM FBG in both the \nfast and slow axes of the fiber (1.264 \u00b1 0.02 pm\/\u00b5\u03b5 and 1.282 \u00b1 \n0.009 pm\/\u00b5\u03b5 for slow and fast axes respectively). \u0194 fast and \u0178\nslow axes.\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\n125\n150\n20 22.5 25 27.5 30 32.5 35\nTemperature (oC)\nW\nav\nel\nen\ngt\nh \nsh\nift\n (p\nm\n)\nFig. 4: Temperature response for PM FBG in both the slow and \nfast axes (10.326 \u00b1 0.02 pm\/oC and 11.858 \u00b1 0.2 pm\/oC for slow \nand fast axes respectively). \u0194 fast and \u0178 slow axes.\nAs a proof of the efficiency of the sensing method, simultaneous detection of AC strain and temperature changes is \ndemonstrated in figure 5. It is worth noting, from figure 5a, how the system discriminates between slow longitudinal \nstrain and temperature variations applied at different frequencies by the slow-axis (laser 1) and the fast-axis (laser 2) \nsignals. In figure 5b, the corresponding FFT traces are illustrated, exhibiting the peaks corresponding to mechanical (8 \nHz) and thermal (0.5 Hz) excitations in the fiber. A preliminary estimate suggests that quasi-static strain near to the 10 \nn\u03b5 level are within reach of our system, as can be deduced from figure 5b. At acoustic frequencies, we expect a gain of \nsensitivity of nearly a factor 100.

Using a low-voltage \nPZT, we applied static and dynamic (acoustic) strain along the intra-cavity fiber, while the two lasers are frequency \nlocked to a couple of distinct, crossed-polarized resonances. As is visible in figure 6, from the sharp peak at 900 Hz, the \nsystem is capable of detecting even smaller signals thanks to the resonator enhancement, showing a strain-noise level \napproaching 60 p\u03b5\/\u221aHz.

CONCLUSIONS \nIn this work, we present recent results on a novel interrogation scheme, relying on a laser-frequency stabilization \ntechnique, which enables for active tracking of FBG-based sensors fabricated in HiBi fiber. Both, a single Panda-fiber \nBragg grating sensor and an intrinsically highly-reflectivity-FBG resonator were used in demonstrating the capability to \nperform simultaneous interrogation of the two orthogonal polarisation axes of a HiBi FBG thereby opening up prospects \nfor strain-temperature discrimination, given high measured resolution possible with laser-based spectroscopic methods. \nBased on a preliminary estimate, minimum detectable strain signals below 10 n\u03b5\/\u221aHz and 60 p\u03b5\/\u221aHz can be in principle \nachieved for the single sensor and the fiber resonator, respectively. Quasi-static temperature variations of the order of \nfew mK could be detected simultaneously by a single sensor. Interrogation and test of the fiber resonator in a similar \nfashion for simultaneous high-sensitivity strain and temperature measurements are in progress. Furthermore, an \nexperimental investigation of cross-sensitivity effects of transverse strain and longitudinal strain in a dynamic \nmeasurement regime is in progress. \nREFERENCES \n1. B.
