These fast com-\nponents are due to fluorescence quenching, which causes a\nreduction in efficiency of the light emission. However, most\nprevious experiments have been made at considerably\ngreater excitation densities than this study. In many cases,\nphoton fluences are as much as 2 orders higher than those\nused here. The nature of charge generation from singlet ex-\ncitons is one such process that has been primarily studied at\nsuch high excitation densities. The result of this is that the\ndata become complicated by the simultaneous observation of\nmany processes and often small differences in the experi-\nmental conditions can change the dominance of the various\nprocesses, and therefore conclusions obtained can appear\ninconsistent.12\u201316 In many cases, the intensity dependent phe-\nnomena observed are present at the lowest excitation densi-\nties measured and as a result it can be difficult to reconcile\nwith data from experiments such as time resolved fluores-\ncence measurements which only require very low pump\nfluence.11,17 The result is that time resolved measurements on\nconjugated polymers often fall into two categories, high\npump dose and low pump dose with little data available in\nthe crossover. This study is based around excitation density\ndependent measurements in this crucial area, showing the\ntransition from the intrinsic phenomena to those at high ex-\ncitation densities.\nTwo such intensity dependent processes which represent a\nloss of efficiency in conjugated polymer devices are the bi-\nmolecular singlet-singlet and singlet-triplet annihilation\nreactions.18,19 In these cases, excitation energy is transferred\nfrom an excited singlet to another excited singlet or triplet\nstate. Singlet-singlet annihilation only occurs when the sin-\nglet excitation density becomes large enough that the singlets\nare able to interact with each other within their lifetime. Gen-\nerally, it can be considered that such exciton annihilation\nreactions generate a highly excited singlet state which may\nrapidly return to the excited singlet state.20 Alternatively, as\nthe energy is sufficient to overcome the \u00030.4 eV exciton\nbinding energy, the exciton is able to dissociate into\ncharges.21,22 The two possible are shown below.\nS1 + S1\u2192 S0 + Sn,\nSn\u2192 \u00011 \u2212 \u0004\u0002\u0001S1 + Q\u0002 + \u0004\u0001p+ + p\u2212\u0002 ,\nwhere S0 is the singlet ground state, S1 is the excited singlet\nstate, Sn represents higher excited singlet states which rap-\nidly thermalize to S1 with the release of heat \u0001Q\u0002, and p+ and\np\u2212 are a pair of charges which are generated with a propor-\ntion \u0004\nThe case of singlet-triplet annihilation is especially rel-\nevant to the polymer light emitting diode \u0001PLED\u0002 commu-\nnity due to the higher proportion of triplets formed in devices\nin comparison with photoexcitation. Additionally, their\nlonger lifetime compared to singlets allows a large triplet\npopulation to build up during device operation. Considering\nthis, if the rate of singlet-triplet quenching is significant, then\nit represents a major loss channel for singlet emission in\ndevices.\nPHYSICAL REVIEW B 76, 085204 \u00012007\u0002\n1098-0121\/2007\/76\u00018\u0002\/085204\u00017\u0002 \u00a92007 The American Physical Society085204-1\nEXPERIMENT\nUltrafast photoinduced absorption \u0001PA\u0002 measurements\nwere made using a conventional femtosecond pump probe\nsystem. The system is based around a Coherent Mira 900-f\nfemtosecond oscillator and RegA 9000 laser amplifier. The\n180 fs, \u00034 \u0001J, 100 kHz pulses at 1.6 eV are split inside an\nOPA; 75% of the power is used to generate the 3.2 eV pump\nbeam. The remaining portion is focused into a sapphire plate\nto generate a white light supercontinuum, which is either\nused directly as probe beam for measuring transient spectra\nwith a diode array spectrometer or to seed the OPA and gen-\nerate a single wavelength beam for measuring kinetics. This\nhigh repetition rate system is ideal for low pump fluence\nmeasurements, allowing high signal to noise ratios for low\npump dose; overall, this allows the measurement of dT \/T as\nsmall as 10\u22126 using lock-in detection.\nMeasurements to determine the extent of singlet-triplet\nannihilation were carried out using the same pump probe\nsystem. In addition, a background level of triplets was gen-\nerated by a 50 mW, 3.06 eV diode laser, focused to a\n0.5 cm2 spot. At low temperature, the long lifetime of triplets\nin comparison with singlets allows a high background triplet\npopulation to be built up under cw excitation by the diode\nlaser. The triplets appear as static quenching sites for the\nsinglets because the singlets are comparatively mobile with\nrespect to the triplet population.\nThin films of the pure polymer PF2\/6 were spin cast from\na toluene solution, yielding films of about 100 nm thick; all\npolymer handling was done in UV-light-free clean room to\nminimize the effects of sample degradation. Additionally, all\nexperiments were carried out under dynamic vacuum of\n\u000310\u22125 mbar.\nSINGLET-SINGLET ANNIHILATION\nThe transient absorption spectra of PF2\/6 in Fig. 1 show\nsimilar features to those previously obtained for other conju-\ngated polymers.9,23 Within our energy range, three main fea-\ntures are observed. In the period immediately following ex-\ncitation, a sharp absorption peak around 1.6 eV dominates;\nalso immediately observed is a small amount of stimulated\nemission in the region of the photoluminescence at 2.8 eV.\nMany previous works on conjugated polymers have corre-\nlated the kinetics of these two features, unambiguously as-\nsigning the absorption at 1.6 eV to the S1-Sn transition.11,23,24\nAt longer times, the spectral features due to the singlet exci-\nton decay and are replaced by a broad absorption peak at\n2.4 eV. Assignment of this feature as a charged state has\nbeen made before in field assisted pump probe experiments,\nwhere free carriers are generated and a similar absorption is\nobserved.13 Pulse radiolysis and doping induced absorption\nstudies also provide strong evidence that this feature is the\nabsorption of the polyfluorene cation.25 The clear isobestic\npoint at 2.15 eV is a strong evidence that the charged state is\nformed as a direct result of the decay of the singlet exciton:\nit is a quenching product of the singlet exciton. The lack of\nabsorption in this region immediately after photoexcitation is\na direct proof that the charge carriers are not generated di-\nrectly by optical absorption in this case.\nThe decay of the singlet transition at 1.6 eV is shown in\nFig. 2; at low excitation dose \u00010.35 \u0001J cm\u22122\u0002, the un-\nquenched lifetime is approximately 250 ps, similar to fluo-\nrescence lifetimes measured by time correlated single photon\ncounting.26 At high excitation densities, an additional fast\ncomponent begins to dominate the decay. It is possible to\nquantify the change in the decay rate with excitation densi-\nties by comparing the intensity of the photoinduced absorp-\ntion after 100 ps with the initial intensity of the absorption;\nthis is shown in Fig. 3. It is apparent that the initial peak PA\nintensity scales linearly with the pump fluence; thus, the ex-\ncitation densities are well below the absorption saturation\nthreshold. At low excitation densities, the magnitude after\n100 ps also scales linearly, a confirmation that at these low\nexcitation densities, the intensity dependent decay does not\ncompete with the natural lifetime of the exciton.

It is also impor-\ntant to note that at a similar threshold, the intensity of the PA\nat 2.4 eV, the charged state absorption \u0001including a small\ncontribution from the overlap of the singlet features\u0002, also\nshows an additional increase in intensity.\nThe change of the singlet excitation density dependence\n\u0001after 100 ps\u0002 to a slope of \u00030.5 at high excitation densities\nis the result of a bimolecular exciton quenching process,\ndominating the decay above a threshold pump fluence of\n\u00031 \u0001J cm\u22122 \u00012\u00021012 photons cm\u22122\u0002. The only feasible sce-\nnario for a bimolecular reaction in a pristine film is that of\nthe singlet-singlet annihilation \u0001SSA\u0002.22 The charges that are\nformed by this reaction are responsible for the characteristic\ncharge state absorption at 2.4 eV. This threshold pump flu-\nence for SSA, which is smaller than some previously re-\nported values for conjugated polymers,11 is measured di-\nrectly without the need to fit data to complex models of\nexciton dynamics which are often necessary when data are\nonly available at higher excitation densities.11,22,27,28 This\ncould, in part, explain the apparent confusion over the\nmechanism of charge generation in ultrafast experiments in\nconjugated polymers.\nThe bimolecular annihilation reaction can proceed via two\nmechanisms; the rate limiting step could be either the energy\ntransfer itself as would be expected from a purely long range\nF\u00f6rster mechanism. Alternatively, the diffusion of the exci-\ntons between neighboring chains can give rise to an addi-\ntional interaction either by a collisional- or Dexter-type elec-\ntron transfer process or by migration into the F\u00f6rster-radius\nof another exciton again yielding F\u00f6rster-type energy trans-\nfer. Both mechanisms lead to the generalized rate equation,\ndN\ndt\n= G\u0001t\u0002 \u2212\nN\n\u0005\n\u2212 \u0006\u0001t\u0002N2, \u00011\u0002\nwhere G\u0001t\u0002 represents the exciton generation function, N is\nthe exciton density, \u0005 is the exciton lifetime, and \u0006\u0001y\u0002 the\nannihilation parameter, which can, in some cases, have a\ntime dependence.\nThe condition for energy transfer by the long range\nF\u00f6rster interaction is that there must be an overlap of the\nfluorescence of the donor and the absorption of the acceptor\n\u0001the excited singlet state\u0002. From which it is possible to cal-\nculate the F\u00f6rster radius, i.e., the separation required for en-\nergy transfer to compete with the unquenched decay of the\nsinglet, this parameter is defined by Forster\u2019s equation,\nR0\n6\n=\n9000\u0001ln 10\u0002\u00072QD\n128\b5Nn4 \u0004 FD\u0001\t\u0002\nA\u0001\t\u0002\t4d\t , \u00012\u0002\nwhere QD is the fluorescence quantum yield in the absence of\nthe acceptor, n is the refractive index of the medium, N is\nAvogadro\u2019s number, and \u00072 is the factor describing the rela-\ntive orientation of the donor and acceptor dipoles, normally\nassumed to be equal to 2\/3. FD\u0001\t\u0002 is the normalized fluores-\ncence of the donor and \nA\u0001\t\u0002 is the absorption spectrum of\nthe acceptor. Given the small overlap between the singlet\nfluorescence of PF2\/6 and its photoinduced absorption spec-\ntrum, we find that this calculated F\u00f6rster radius, RSSA\n=11\u00b15 \u00c5, is of the same magnitude to the typical separation\nof the polymer chains in the film.29 For the rapid quenching\nobserved due to SSA, the typical separation of the excitons\nwould be required to be considerably smaller than this, im-\nplying intrachain singlets. However, SSA is observed for\nrelatively low excitation densities, for example, an excitation\ndose of 6 \u0001J cm\u22122 gives a mean separation of the excitations\nof approximately 10 nm. Hence, for the simplistic case of\nstatic quenching by the long range dipole interaction, anni-\nhilation would not be expected to take place. Referring once\nagain to Fig. 2, it is clear that at low temperature, for com-\nparable pump fluences, the effect of annihilation is apprecia-\nbly less. The thermal activation of the annihilation gives an\nindication of the cause of the lower than expected threshold:\nexciton diffusion. Previous studies of the effect of tempera-\nture on the quenching rate of simple polymer-dopant\nsystems30 have shown that the rate of diffusion of singlet\nexcitons in polyfluorene changes from 0.43 nm2 ps\u22121 at\n10 K to 1.44 nm2 ps\u22121 at 300 K. In the SSA case, excitons\nare able to move faster and further at high temperature and\nthe effect of annihilation is greater. An additional factor\nwhich could further increase the distances that the excitons\ninteract over is the spatial extent of the exciton itself, which\nin some cases extends over approximately 5 nm, limiting the\nusefulness of the point dipole approximation.31 The very\nshort Forster radius, which is comparable to the size of the\nexciton, would suggest that the energy transfer is a Dexter-\ntype exchange interaction as this would be expected to domi-\nnate at the length scales where there is overlap of the donor\nand acceptor orbitals.32\nFitting the data to the integrated rate equation becomes\ncomplicated by the possibility of the quadratic annihilation\nterm in Eq. \u00011\u0002 having a time dependent coefficient \u0006\u0001t\u0002. In\norder to fit the data, we use a modification of the method of\nDogariu et al.10 With this method, the calculation of the time\ndependence of the SSA coefficient is made by renormalizing\nthe data with a new variable,\nFIG. 3. \u0001Color online\u0002 Excitation dose dependences for the in-\ntensity of the PA absorption at 1.6 and 2.4 eV.

Previously,\nthis had proved difficult due to the noise on the data and an\nintegral form of \u0006\u0001t\u0002 was derived. However, by fitting our\ndata with a multiexponential model to accurately reproduce\nthe shape of the curve and using this as N\u0001t\u0002 it is possible to\ndirectly plot \u0006\u0001t\u0002 \u0001Fig. 4\u0002. The initial annihilation parameter\nis \u0006\u00010\u0002=2.5\u000210\u22128 cm3 s\u22121 at 10 K and \u0006\u00010\u0002=9.5\n\u000210\u22128 cm3 s\u22121 at 300 K.\nThe calculated annihilation parameter is not constant over\ntime; in molecular crystals, the same behavior has previously\nbeen observed.21 In this case, the annihilation parameter de-\ncreases with time because the diffusion constant is small\ncompared to the spatial distribution of the states; as a result,\nthere is a localized depletion of the exciton density which is\nnot compensated for by diffusion. This leads to the time de-\npendence of the annihilation parameter of the form:10,33\n\u0006\u0001t\u0002 = 4\bDR\u00051 + R\u0006\bDt\u0007 , \u00015\u0002\nwhere D is the diffusion constant and R the radius of the\ninteraction. However, after the first few picoseconds, our sys-\ntem is in the high diffusion regime, i.e., D\u000bR2 \/\bt, so the\nequation can be simplified to \u0006=4\bDR, which no longer\ncontains any intrinsic time dependence. Figure 4 shows the\ncalculated time dependence of \u0006\u0001t\u0002 from the experimental\ndata at 10 K compared to the expected time dependence\nfrom Eq. \u00013\u0002. The shape of the time dependence of the the-\noretical and the experimental curves is different since \u0006 re-\nmains higher for longer than would be expected from the\nmodel. The higher annihilation rate in the intermediate time\nis due to the nature of energy transfer in conjugated poly-\nmers. The large inhomogeneous broadening of the spectrum\nof CPs leads to a time dependence of the diffusion constant.\nThe exciton diffusion is enhanced in the early time by down-\nhill migration to lower energy chain segments and then once\nthe excitons are thermalized, slower diffusion takes over.34,35\nThis time dependence of the exciton diffusion contributes to\nthe observed time dependence of \u0006\u0001t\u0002, keeping the annihila-\ntion rate higher for longer while the excitons are able to\nmove faster due to the dispersive component in the migra-\ntion. At longer times after the dispersive migration is over,\nthe annihilation rate tends toward the theoretical constant\nvalue given by Eq. \u00015\u0002.\nSINGLET-TRIPLET ANNIHILATION\nIn a similar way to SSA, it is possible for singlet excitons\nto be quenched by triplet excitons. Once again, the F\u00f6rster\nradius for the interaction can be calculated from the overlap\nof the singlet fluorescence and the widely reported triplet\nexcited state absorption for polyfluorene.36 This is larger than\nfor the singlet-singlet interaction, RSTA=21\u00b15 \u00c5. For the\nsimple case of Forster transfer, it implies that it should be\ncomparatively easier for the singlets to annihilate with trip-\nlets than with other singlets. By allowing a background of\ntriplets to build up using a cw laser with the sample at low\ntemperature and then measuring the singlet lifetime, it is pos-\nsible to see the effect of singlet-triplet annihilation on the\nsinglet population.\nEvaluation of the effect of the background triplet popula-\ntion on the singlet kinetics requires knowledge of the triplet\npopulation in the film. Estimation of the triplet population is\nnot a trivial process given that even for low temperatures,\nhigh excitation densities cause triplet-triplet annihilation to\ndominate the decay of the triplets. This leads to a quadratic\nterm in the rate equation for cw excitation,\ndNT\ndt\n= A \u2212 \u0006TTNT\n2\n\u2212 ktNT. \u00014\u0001\u0002\nConsidering that the rate of radiative decay is very slow\ncompared to the rate that the excitons annihilate, the phos-\nphorescence term can be effectively ignored. This gives a\nsolution for Eq. \u00014\u0002, where the steady-state triplet density is\nproportional to \u0006A \/\u0006TT \u0001where A is the rate of triplet genera-\ntion and \u0006TT the triplet-triplet annihilation parameter\u0002. A\nmore detailed description of the modeling of the triplet popu-\nlation is given in our previous work.37 The precise determi-\nnation of \u0006TT in the solid state has been previously made for\na number of polyfluorenes and polyfluorene derivatives.

PHYSICAL REVIEW B 76, 085204 \u00012007\u0002\n085204-4\nstates during the experiment. Based on the assumption that\nthe maximum separation of a singlet and a triplet occurs\nwhen the singlet exciton is placed halfway between two trip-\nlets, the variation of the singlet to triplet distance with \u0006TT is\nshown on the right hand panel of Fig. 5. Also shown, for\ncomparison, is the mean separation of singlets at the thresh-\nold for SSA. For the singlet-triplet separation to become\ngreater than the singlet-singlet separation at the threshold for\nSSA, the TTA rate would have to be approximately ten times\nthe highest reported values. The left panel of Fig. 5 shows\nthe variation of singlet separation and the variation of the\nsinglet-triplet \u0001S-T\u0002 separation with depth into the sample,\ncalculated using the Beer-Lambert law for the singlet distri-\nbution and the Beer-Lambert law in combination with the\nabove equation for the S-T distance. Both the calculations in\nFig. 4 show that the S-T distance during cw photoexcitation\nis always less than the singlet separation required for SSA.\nThe number of triplets created by the femtosecond pump\nbeam can effectively be ignored as the cw power of the fem-\ntosecond beam during the experiments was less than\n1 mW cm\u22122, negligible compared to the cw excitation beam\nused to generate a background of triplets. In order to prevent\nthe confusing effect of observing both SSA and STA, the\nfemtosecond excitation beam was kept below the threshold\nfor SSA during the experiment.\nIt was found that measurement of the singlet lifetime with\na background triplet population at low temperature has no\neffect on the decay rate of the singlet excitons. Figure 6\nshows a comparison between the decay of the singlet photo-\ninduced absorption signal for a thin film of PF2\/6 both with\nand without a background triplet population; the decay re-\nmains unchanged throughout the whole of the singlet life-\ntime. Although unexpected, this result is in agreement with\nour previous work showing that the cw photoluminescence\nand electroluminescence intensity are additive. When a de-\nvice is simultaneously excited optically and electrically, the\nemission intensity is the same as the sum of the fluorescence\nfrom the individual electrical and optical excitations.39 Both\nthese measurements show that the large background of trip-\nlets created in a polymer either optically or electrically does\nnot significantly quench the singlets. The implications of this\nare very promising especially for the potential maximum ef-\nficiency of PLEDs running at high brightness.\nIn the first instance, it seems unremarkable that STA is not\nobserved, as the separation between singlets and triplets is\ngreater than the F\u00f6rster radius of the interaction. What is\nsurprising is that the singlet-singlet annihilation, for similar\nF\u00f6rster radius and separation of excitons, is very efficient\ndue to the diffusion of excitons; thus the SSA is strongly\nactivated by diffusion and STA is not. To understand the\nprocess that causes this, we return to the earlier observation\non the mechanism of the energy transfer. At the short dis-\ntances that are involved in SSA, Dexter transfer dominates\nthe annihilation process. Therefore, we can assume that both\nthe SSA and STA proceed via a Dexter-type electron ex-\nchange mechanism. One of the requirements for Dexter\ntransfer is an overlap of the electronic orbitals of the donor\nand the acceptor. For SSA where the singlet orbitals involved\nare identical and spatially large, this is easy to achieve. How-\never, the overlap between singlet and triplet orbitals is less.\nThis is partially due to the differing shape of the singlet and\ntriplet states. The singlet states are oriented parallel to the\nchain, whereas the triplet states are oriented perpendicular to\nthe chain; thus, the overlap of the states necessary for elec-\ntron exchange is difficult due to symmetry constraints.40 Also\nthe differing spatial extent of the states becomes important. If\nit is assumed that the polymer chain is divided into segments\nbound by conformational or chemical defects, one normally\nassumes that the singlet exciton occupies most of the seg-\nment, a phenomenon known as the effective conjugation\nlength \u0001typically 25\u201330 repeat units\u0002.41,42 Conversely, the\ntriplet exciton is understood to only occupy a segment of a\nfew phenyl rings;43\u201345 thus, if the reasonable assumption that\neach chain segment can only hold one excitation \u0001either sin-\nglet or triplet\u0002, then the mean distance from the singlet to the\nneighboring triplet exciton is large and the necessary overlap\nof the states required for intrachain STA by Dexter transfer\nwould not be possible.

The process is entirely diffu-\nsion controlled and a time dependence of the annihilation\nparameter is observed due to the inherent time dependence of\ndiffusion controlled process as well as the effect of disper-\nsive migration on the diffusion rate in the initial time. The\nlow pump fluence required for SSA highlights the impor-\ntance of using low excitation densities in ultrafast studies of\nconjugated polymers and could be the cause of some of the\nconfusion over the nature of charge generation by photoex-\ncitation. Additionally, we find no evidence of the singlet-\ntriplet annihilation when there is a background triplet density\ncomparable to the singlet density required for SSA; this is\nattributed to the differing shape and spatial extent of the\nsinglet and triplet states involved.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe acknowledge support from CENAMPS and One\nNorth East and S.M.K. thanks the Durham Photonic Materi-\nals Institute.\n1 J.
