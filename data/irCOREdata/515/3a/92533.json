A cross-sectional survey was conducted of people \nwith intellectual disabilities, identified via provider organisations, with supplementary \ncollection of costs data.  Multivariate analyses of cost variations were carried out for 930 \nadults with intellectual disabilities. There were strong, non-linear, interdependent links \nbetween degree of intellectual disability, behaviour, service use and costs. Higher costs were \nassociated with more severe intellectual disabilities and more challenging behaviour. Sector \nand scale of residence also influenced cost in quite complex ways. Access to and use of \nservices by people with intellectual disabilities were not always appropriately linked to \nperceived or actual needs. Policy makers and local commissioning agencies need to explore \nthe sources of cost variation between individuals, sectors and types of accommodation in \norder to achieve national policy objectives on quality, choice, independence and inclusion.  \n \n \nKEY WORDS \n \nIntellectual disability, challenging behaviour, service use, costs \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n 3\nINTRODUCTION \nThe White Paper Valuing People: a New Strategy for Learning Disability in the 21st Century \nidentifies people with intellectual disabilities as \u2018amongst the most vulnerable and socially \nexcluded in our society\u2019, and sets out four key principles \u2013 rights, independence, choice and \ninclusion \u2013 for improving their quality of life chances (Secretary of State for Health 2001). \nThe Government\u2019s national objectives for people with intellectual disabilities are built around \na person-centred approach that enables them \u2018to have as much choice and control as possible \nover their lives and the services and support they receive\u2019 (p 4). The cost implications and \nbroader affordability of a person-centred approach have been questioned (Mansell and \nBeadle-Brown 2004).    \n \nAs no two users of a given service or programme will have exactly the same characteristics or \nneeds, or hold the exact same preferences \u2013 and because they will also differ in their personal \nand family circumstances \u2013 it follows from a person-centred approach that service responses \nshould rarely be identical. Such an approach starts with the individual and not with services, \nand the White Paper argues that all options should be considered when the future needs of \npeople with intellectual disabilities and their families are being explored. Local authorities \nalso have the duty of Best Value: they must deliver services by the most economic, efficient \nand effective means available, publish annual Best Value Performance Plans and review all \nof their services every five years. \n \nIn reality, however, service use patterns tend to show rather less variability than individual \nneeds or preferences. This is partly because services are constrained by historical availability, \nfunding practices, professional norms and provider habits; partly perhaps because of a simple \nbut pervasive societal preference for some degree of consistency or procedural equity in \nservice access, and partly because the information on user needs available to commissioners \n(purchasers) has been less than perfect. One of the unlamented features of care environments \nin some of the UK\u2019s former \u2018mental handicap\u2019 hospitals was the often very marked degree of \nuniformity and rigidity that ignored differences between individuals. This is one of the \ndefining features of an \u2018institutional\u2019 environment. But now that services for almost everyone \nwith an intellectual disability in the UK are delivered in non-hospital settings, albeit not \nalways \u2018non-institutional\u2019, we must ask whether service systems are responding more flexibly \nto individual needs and preferences.  \n  \n 4\n \nThe aim of this paper is to address this question. In particular, we seek (a) to describe the \npatterns of service use and costs for people with intellectual disabilities in care \naccommodation in some areas of England; (b) to explore the correlates of those patterns; and \n(c) to examine the degree to which cost variations are linked to the characteristics of users \n(notably degree of intellectual disability and behavioural problems) in the context of other \nfactors. \n \nMETHODS \n \nSampling and data collection \n \nData were collected as part of a study designed to develop \u2018resource groups\u2019 and \u2018benefit \ngroups\u2019 for people with intellectual disabilities (Pendaries 1997a, Comas-Herrera et al. 2001).  \nThere were three phases of data collection, covering: (i) characteristics of sample members, \n(ii) their use of services and (iii) the unit costs of services. \n \nThe first phase, in 1996, assessed the characteristics of a sample of over 2000 people with \nintellectual disabilities aged 18 or over on two dimensions, intellectual disability and \nchallenging behaviour, using a revised version of the Learning Disability Casemix Scale \n(LDCS; Pendaries 1997b). Sample members were living in residential accommodation \nsupported by 11 NHS Trusts, four voluntary providers (including housing associations) and \nthree large and several small private providers spread across England. Each organisation that \nagreed to take part in the study was sent LDCS assessment forms (see below), together with \nwritten instructions on how to administer them. In total, information was collected for 2093 \npeople in this first phase. This was a pragmatically gathered sample and the areas and \nproviders together do not generate a nationally representative sample of people with \nintellectual disabilities.  \n \nIn the second phase, service use data were gathered for a sub-set of clients using a tailored \nversion of the Client Service Receipt Inventory (CSRI; Beecham & Knapp 1992). The CSRI \nwas sent to the 14 providers willing to continue in the research. Together they supported 1300 \npeople with intellectual disabilities. Questionnaires were returned for 1128 service users, or \n  \n 5\n87% of those participating in this phase. Eight questionnaires were unusable due to missing \ninformation. \n \nIn the third phase, a newly developed costing pro-forma (see below) was sent out to gather \nrevenue and capital costs information. Although some organisations were unable to provide \nthe cost information required, the response rate was generally good: data were provided for \n930 people (83% of the 1128 people for whom CSRI information had been returned).  \nHousing associations and private sector providers were less likely than others to provide \nfinancial information. (The housing associations had not been directly involved in previous \nphases of the project and possibly had fewer incentives to return costs data. One of the \nprivate providers did not have the necessary financial information readily available.) \n \nResearch instruments \n \nLearning Disability Casemix Scale (LDCS)  \n \nThe instrument used to assess the 2093 participants in the first phase was a revised version of \nthe LDCS (Pendaries 1997b). It has two main dimensions: intellectual disability and \nchallenging behaviour. In the revision, two items were added to the ability\/disability sub-\nscale, bringing the total number of variables for the ability\/disability sub-scale to 14. Two \nfurther variables were also added to the behaviour sub-scale, bringing the total number of \nbehaviour variables to nine. The items added to the ability\/disability subscale (\u2018Self Initiated \nActivity\u2019 and \u2018Ability to Sustain Attention\u2019) were intended to account for limitations of the \nlearning process, an aspect not covered in the original scale. The two items added to the \nchallenging behaviour sub-scale (\u2018Dealing with Frustration\u2019 and \u2018Excess or Deficit of Social \nInteraction\u2019) were intended to capture relatively common forms of behaviour that often result \nin increased staff input. These changes improved the validity of the scale (Comas-Herrera et \nal. 2001). In both sub-scales, higher scores indicate higher levels of severity. \n \nThe validity of the LDCS has been tested in relation to the Adaptive Behaviour Schedule \n(Nihira et al. 1993), a well-established research instrument, and been found to measure \nsimilar things. The LDCS has also been found to have good inter-observer reliability and \ngood test-retest reliability (Pendaries 1997b). \n  \n 6\n \nClient Service Receipt Inventory (CSRI) \n \nTo collect information on individual service utilisation patterns, a version of the Client \nService Receipt Inventory (CSRI) was prepared. The CSRI was reduced so that it covered \nonly two sides of A4 paper and concentrated on accommodation arrangements as well as the \nuse of services provided and funded separately from the accommodation budget. A \nretrospective period of three months was selected, although use of services which have high \ncost implications, such as hospital care, was recorded for a period of 12 months. Note that \nthese services are those not included in the residential accommodation budget. \n \nCosting pro-forma   \n \nA separate questionnaire was used to gather information to complement the financial \ninformation available from the income and expenditure accounts (for the financial year \n1996\/97) for each facility in which service users lived. The pro-forma covered the valuation \nof the buildings in which care was provided (such as the council tax band), whether the home \npaid overheads and whether services were provided to non-residents. In the main, the finance \ndepartment of each participating organisation provided these data. \n \nCosting methodology \n \nThe estimation of costs followed established methodologies and principles of economic \nevaluation in this field (e.g. Beecham 1995). After collecting service utilisation data using the \nCSRI we estimated the long-run marginal opportunity cost for each service in a unit of time \n(per day or per hour) that reflects the way people use it. Each unit cost was then adjusted to \nreflect the intensity (duration and frequency) of service use to allow calculation of the full \ncost of each care package. \n \nIn estimating the long-run marginal opportunity costs of accommodation facilities the \nrevenue costs included the full staffing costs (care staff and others), adjusted for the hours \nstaff spent providing support to non-residents. Non-staffing costs included items such as heat, \nlight, routine maintenance and household equipment. Overhead costs borne by the managing \n  \n 7\nagency were calculated using the organisation\u2019s own accounts where possible, or by adding \n5% of other revenue costs (Audit Commission 1993). Three techniques were used to estimate \nthe level of resources invested in the buildings and equipment (capital costs): a figure based \non a recent market valuation of the site discounted at 6% over sixty years; a valuation based \non the property\u2019s council tax banding and discounted at 6% over 60 years; or, where \nconsidered to be more accurate than the council tax band, rent payments made by the \nindividual organisations and their own arrangements for depreciation of capital. When the \norganisation could not provide a realistic replacement cost for fixtures and fittings, 10% of \nthe annual building costs was added (as, for example, in the method used by Emerson et al. \n1999). \n \nFor hospital and community-based services not provided by the organisation responsible for \naccommodation and associated care, unit cost estimates were taken from the widely used \nannual compilation by the Personal Social Services Research Unit (Netten et al. 1998). \nWhere costs for specific professionals were not available from this source, unit costs \ncalculated by colleagues and employed in current or recent evaluations of services for people \nwith intellectual disabilities or challenging behaviour were used (Emerson et al. 2001). Some \nsample members attended work-orientated day activity services. The provision of work for \npeople with intellectual disabilities represents both a cost and a benefit to the employer: the \nbenefit of the goods produced and the cost of the supervising staff. Following the approach \nadopted by Emerson et al. (2001), we assumed that employers cover their costs and so a zero \ncost has been recorded for work-related activities. \n \nAll costs are expressed in pounds sterling at 1996\/7 price levels, as this was the period in \nwhich the service use and other data were collected. To inflate to current prices would in \nprinciple need a separate inflator for each service, although in fact all services have seen low \nand quite similar cost inflation since 1997 (Netten & Curtis 2003). Multiplying all costs \nreported in this paper by 1.29 would take them (approximately) to 2002\/03 price levels. \n \nStatistical methods \n \nWe hypothesised that service use patterns would vary between individuals and would be \nrelated in part to inter-individual differences in the severity of intellectual disability and \n  \n 8\nchallenging behaviour. We first examined patterns of service use using logistic regression to \nestimate the probability of receipt for each service, given the characteristics of the clients and \ntheir care settings. We then summed the services used by individuals, weighted by their unit \ncosts, to obtain an aggregate cost measure for each person. Using ordinary least squares \n(OLS) multiple regression, we examined a number of possible sources of cost variation.  \nHowever, a common finding in economic evaluations in health and social care contexts is \nthat costs do not follow a normal distribution, but rather have a long skew to the right. If this \nnon-normality in cost carries through to leave regression residuals also non-normally \ndistributed, OLS estimates may not be appropriate. We therefore also employed bootstrap \nmethods using bias-corrected methods and 2000 replications to calculate an alternative set of \nstandard errors (Thompson & Barber 2000). \n \nRESULTS \n \nSample characteristics \n \nWe obtained data about the characteristics and service receipt of 1120 people, and data on the \ncosts of the services for 930 of them. As Table 1 shows, there were few differences between \nthe full sample and the costed sub-sample. The 1120 people were living in 158 different \nresidential settings. Mean scale of facility was 13 residents, but in fact there were \u2018clusters\u2019 of \nscale: 129 sample members were in settings clustered around a scale of 44 residents, and 988 \nsample members were in settings clustered around a scale of nine residents. \n \n[TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE] \n \nWe found substantial differences in the severity of intellectual disability and challenging \nbehaviour of service users according to whether they lived in NHS or private\/voluntary \nfacilities. NHS trusts tended to specialise in providing services for people with more \nprofound levels of severity (Table 2). (For a more detailed description of the data, see \nComas-Herrera et al. 2001.) \n \n[TABLE 2 ABOUT HERE] \n \n  \n 9\nIn the final stage of the project there were 14 organisations: seven NHS trusts (66% of people \nin the sample), six private for-profit providers (25% of the sample), and one voluntary or \nnon-profit provider (9% of the sample). These percentages can be compared with the \ndistribution of places in staffed residential homes in England in 1996-97: 9% in the NHS, \n39% in the private sector, 34% in the voluntary sector, and 18% in local authority homes \n(Kavanagh & Opit 1998). Our sample therefore over-represented the NHS sector and under-\nrepresented the other sectors, and so it would be inadvisable to generalise from the results \nthat follow. Nevertheless, this quite large sample provided us with an unusual opportunity to \nexplore the sources of inter-individual service use and cost variation within some sectors of \nprovision. \n \nFor purposes of this analysis, the single voluntary sector provider in the sample was grouped \nwith the private sector providers to ensure that our results were not too biased by the \ncharacteristics particular to this one provider. Two sectoral groups were therefore examined \u2013 \nNHS trusts and independent sector (private and voluntary) providers \u2013 in our subsequent \nanalyses of service use and cost variations. Voluntary and private sector providers are likely \nto differ in certain respects although not as simply or as stereotypically as might be thought, \nas recent work on care homes and domiciliary care services for older people makes plain \n(Kendall 2001, Kendall et al. 2003). \n \nService use and cost \n \nTable 3 shows the percentage of people using some of the services asked about in the study \nand the average costs for each user. (The services not listed in the table were used by less \nthan 5% of the sample.) Each average weekly cost reflects both the intensity with which a \nservice is used and its unit cost. Specialist hospitals for people with intellectual disabilities \n(the former \u2018mental handicap hospitals\u2019) are not listed because so few people had used them \n(1.2% of sample). Hospital-based day activity appears to make the largest contribution to \ntotal cost, reflecting both a tendency to intensive use as well as a higher unit cost than the \nother types of day services. Day centres and social clubs were the more widely used day \nservices. The largest cost component was accommodation (an average of 85% of the total), \nwhich includes living expenses and staff employed on site.  \n \n  \n 10\n[TABLE 3 ABOUT HERE] \n \nAverage total weekly cost for sample members was \u00a3692, which includes averages of \u00a3588 \nfor accommodation (and the associated staffing), \u00a37 for acute health care costs, \u00a375 for day \ncare and \u00a322 for professional (or community) services. Average costs tended to be higher in \nNHS than in other settings (Table 4). People living in NHS settings (long-stay hospital costs, \nhostels and NHS-provided residential care in ordinary housing) were rated as scoring more \nhighly on both the intellectual disability and challenging behaviour indicators, which may \npartly explain the higher costs (examined below). \n \n[TABLE 4 ABOUT HERE] \n \nOn the basis of previous research findings in the UK (discussed later), a number of factors \nmight be hypothesised to account for (at least some of) the observed differences in service \nutilisation and costs, including the characteristics (degrees of intellectual disability and \nchallenging behaviour) of individual service users. We did not have the data to control for all \npossible hypothesised cost-influencing factors. \n \nService use patterns \n \nThere were marked individual variations in service use patterns. This is already obvious from \nTable 3: for example, 7% of sample members used hospital accident and emergency services \nin the previous three months and 93% did not, while only half the sample had seen a GP. \n \nFor each of the services used by a substantial number of sample members we employed \nlogistic regression methods to test for associations between service use, degree of intellectual \ndisability and challenging behaviour, controlling for age, the (average) number of residents in \nthe accommodation facility and whether the provider was an NHS Trust or an independent \nsector provider. Table 5 shows, for each service, whether these factors increased or decreased \nthe probability of using it. \n \n[TABLE 5 ABOUT HERE]  \n \n  \n 11\nThe degree of intellectual disability clearly influenced the use of the services listed in Table \n5, while the extent of challenging behaviour influenced use of day centres\/social clubs, \npsychologists, psychiatrists and dieticians. Some services, such as non-hospital-based day \nactivities, tended to be used by people with more moderate intellectual disabilities, whereas \npeople with higher disability scores were more likely to use hospital-based day activities.  \nIndividuals with more severe intellectual disabilities were more likely to use services such as \nspeech therapy or physiotherapy. As would be expected, higher challenging behaviour scores \nincreased the probability of seeing a psychologist or a psychiatrist. \n \nOther characteristics also affected the probability of receiving services. For example, older \npeople were less likely to be offered services such as places at work-oriented centres, or \nseeing a psychologist or a speech therapist, but more likely to see a GP. \n \nThe average number of residents and the sector to which a home belonged both affected the \nprobability of receiving some services. For example, people in smaller homes were more \nlikely to receive some types of day care than others: they were less likely to go to work \ncentres, education centres or drop-in centres, but on the other hand were more likely to go to \nday centres. Being in a private\/voluntary home also affected the probabilities of receiving \nservices provided outside the home. For example, people living in private\/voluntary homes \nwere less likely than people in NHS facilities to use hospital-based day activities, but more \nlikely to go to education centres or drop-in centres, or receive other types of day care. They \nwere also more likely to see a GP, but less likely to see an occupational therapist or dietician.  \nSome of these variations could be due to differences in the ability of staff in the residential \nfacility to provide services themselves. It may be that staff in private and voluntary homes are \nmore likely to favour flexible day activity packages, or that staff in NHS hospital wards can \naccess basic health care and therapists through other hospital staff. The average staff cost per \nresident in the NHS facilities was much higher than for the private\/voluntary homes, which \nmight reflect higher staff\/resident ratios or more qualified and\/or more highly paid staff in the \nNHS sector. Another factor could be that in NHS accommodation there is greater ease of \naccess to other services provided within the same Trust than would be the case in other \nprovider sectors. \n \n  \n 12\nOverall, we found evidence that whether or not an individual uses a service was linked to a \ncertain extent to their needs-related characteristics; we also found that the size and sector of \naccommodation were influential. We do not report here the results of analyses examining \ndifferences in the quantities of services used but instead turn directly to the aggregated \nversion of these quantities, weighted by their unit costs to measure each individual\u2019s total \nweekly cost of support. \n \nCost variations \n \nThere were marked total cost differences across the sample, ranging from \u00a3220 for one \nperson\u2019s weekly care to as much as \u00a31570 for another. We have just noted that the severity of \nintellectual disability and challenging behaviour, a person\u2019s age, the size of the home and the \nprovider sector all influenced the patterns of use of some services. How did they influence \nservices in aggregate, as measured by total cost? \n \nThe results of the multiple regression equations, using ordinary least squares followed by \nbootstrap methods, are summarised in Table 6. The sample size fell to 919 people, because of \nmissing observations on some variables. The included variables in the regression equation \nexplain a third of the observed cost variation. In other words, the services used by individuals \nwere responding in part to the individual characteristics and features of the care settings \nmeasured in this study. Nevertheless, two-thirds of the observed cost variation cannot be \nexplained (statistically) by the cross-sectional analysis, an issue to which we return shortly.   \n \nCosts were higher for those people with more severe intellectual disabilities and those who \ndisplayed greater levels of challenging behaviour. The cost links are non-linear and \ninterdependent: at more moderate levels of intellectual disability there is a simple positive \nlinear relationship between costs and behaviours; at higher disability levels (where there were \nin fact relatively few sample members) there is a slight curvilinear cost-behaviour \nrelationship, although costs are still generally higher for people with more challenging \nbehaviour. The impact of the comparative severity of intellectual disability on cost is \nmediated through both the sector of accommodation (there being a lower gradient \nrelationship in the NHS sector than in the private\/voluntary sectors) and through the size of \naccommodation setting (the impact of the degree of disability on cost being slightly less in \n  \n 13\nlarger facilities). These significant associations suggest that larger facilities - and these two \nfeatures are correlated - have greater potential to spread the responsibility for supporting \nchallenging behaviours and intellectual disability, respectively, across the staff complement. \n \n[TABLE 6 ABOUT HERE] \n \nThere are also direct effects of sector and size of facility on cost, in addition to those linked to \ndisability levels. Generally, other things being equal, NHS facilities were more expensive \nthan private\/voluntary facilities. However, as just noted, the cost difference between the \nsectors is not straightforward, but linked to facility size and to the characteristics of \nindividual residents. We should therefore be cautious about drawing conclusions about inter-\nsectoral differences from a sample that draws data from a relatively small number of \nindependent sector providers.  \n \nFinally, the scale of facility, in this case measured by the number of residents in the home \nduring the year, exerted an influence. There was an interesting difference between the sectors.  \nNHS facilities clearly enjoyed economies of scale, with cost being just under \u00a32 lower per \nresident week for each additional resident in the facility. In part this was because the NHS \nsample included some people living in quite large hospital facilities. On the other hand, the \nvoluntary\/private facilities appeared to be facing diseconomies of scale, with each additional \nresident in the home generating an additional cost of \u00a32.48 per resident week across all \nresidents. \n \nDISCUSSION  \n \nWe found that access to and utilisation of services by people with long-term needs is clearly \nnot a random process. Equally, however, access and utilisation are not appropriately linked to \nindividual needs. In this paper we sought to explore the connections between the needs of \nindividual people with intellectual disabilities (as measured along just the two dimensions of \nintellectual disability and challenging behaviour, although these are certainly two key \ndimensions for this group of people), their use of individual services and the aggregate cost of \nservice use. Interesting patterns emerged from the analyses.   \n \n  \n 14\nBefore discussing those patterns we should note the main limitations of the study. The sample \nof people with intellectual disabilities was drawn non-randomly, mainly from NHS facilities, \nmaking it difficult to generalise the findings nationally. Second, we only had an aggregated \ncost for the residential accommodation settings. In this respect, our study is the same as \nalmost every other UK study in the intellectual disability and social care fields. (The ward \ncosting by Wright & Haycox 1984 is among the rare exceptions.) It does not cause problems \nwhen looking at total cost. However, it does mean that the analyses of service utilisation \npatterns (summarised in Tables 3 and 5, for example) relate only to services not already \nprovided within the accommodation budget. Third, we had no outcome information and so \nwe cannot comment on, for example, the cost-effectiveness of different accommodation \nsettings.  \n \nFourth, the statistical analyses were able to \u2018explain\u2019 only a third of the observed variance in \ncosts. Reasons for this seemingly low percentage might include the lack of data on other \ncharacteristics of residents and the reality of poor responses by services to individual \ndifferences in intellectual disability and behaviour. Services may be responding poorly for a \nnumber of reasons, including lack of information on individual needs, managerial capacity, \nskilled staff shortages, inflexible working patterns, or financial pressures (Cope 2003, \nDepartment of Health 2004, Learning Disability Task Force 2004). In other words, the \nunexplained variance is probably part methodological and part situational, although we \ncannot separate or quantify the two. In fact, many other cost studies in the intellectual \ndisability field have attained very similar proportions of variance explained (see below). \n \nChallenging behaviour is socially constructed: influenced both by individual factors and the \nenvironment in which people live. The Mansell Report (1993) provides an excellent \ndiscussion of the issues. It did not support large-group models of accommodation and quoted \nevidence of consistently poor quality of life in hospitals. Mansell concluded that the ability to \nprovide services for people with challenging behaviour in small local settings would be an \nindicator of service quality for people with intellectual disabilities in general. The cross-\nsectional study described here could not examine the dynamic effects of the nature of service \nprovision on challenging behaviour, so that residence scale (for example) and degree of \nchallenging behaviour have had to be treated as independent variables in the analysis. \n \n  \n 15\nPatterns and predictions \n \nOur analyses of this quite large data set revealed some complex associations between costs, \nresident characteristics and type of accommodation. The receipt of services outside \nresidential care settings reflected in quite large measure the degrees of intellectual disability \nand behavioural characteristics of individual residents, but there was also a sector effect.  \nService users living in NHS settings were more likely than private\/voluntary sector residents \nto use NHS day hospital services (although this relationship was likely to be heavily \ninfluenced by those residents of NHS hospitals) and more likely to see a dietician or \noccupational therapist, but less likely to go to an education centre, drop-in centre or other \nsocial club, and also less likely to see a GP (again the influence of hospital residence is \npertinent here). These sectoral patterns mirror some previous findings for residential care for \nolder people (Kavanagh & Knapp 1997) and for people with long-term needs associated with \nmental health problems (Hallam et al. 1995). Such patterns might reflect unmeasured needs, \nand\/or the preferences of residential setting staff when seeking outside help, and\/or \ndifferential access to scarce services. More generally, our results support previous evidence \non the poor access to mainstream health care faced by many people with learning disabilities \n(Cooper 1997, Morgan et al. 2000, Secretary of State for Health 2001, Cope 2003). \n \nThe regression analysis showed that costs were significantly linked to the intellectual \ndisability and behavioural characteristics, as well as to scale of residence and sector. Previous \nstudies have reported associations between costs and the needs-related characteristics of \nindividuals with intellectual disabilities. Studies of people who had left long-stay hospital \nsettings for (intended) permanent care in the community have found links between costs and \nservice user needs, particularly skills and behavioural characteristics, and some evidence of \neconomies of scale within accommodation facilities (Knapp et al. 1992, Cambridge et al. \n1994, Beecham et al. 1997). The latter study found that public sector community \naccommodation was more costly than private or voluntary sector accommodation, and indeed \nmore expensive than hospital, after adjusting for differences in resident characteristics. In a \ndifferent research design, looking cross-sectionally at three major types of facility \u2013 village \ncommunities, NHS campus facilities and dispersed housing \u2013 Hallam et al. (2002) found that \nindividual resident characteristics (including age, intellectual disability and challenging \nbehaviour), service model (including group living arrangements and staff qualifications) and \n  \n 16\nservice processes (including social climate) all significantly influenced costs.  Overall, and in \nline with most other studies and with the findings presented here, roughly one third of the \nobserved variation in weekly cost could be explained by these factors. A small sample study \nin Wales looked at the accommodation costs of people with intellectual disabilities and the \nmost severe challenging behaviour (Felce et al. 2000). It found that accommodation cost was \nhigher for residents with lower ability. There was also a scale effect: costs were lower in \nlarger facilities.  \n \nAt a different level of analysis - looking at residential facilities rather than residents - Shiell et \nal. (1993) explored cost variations for a random stratified sample of staffed community \nfacilities in England in the late 1980s. Smaller facilities were apparently no more expensive \nthan larger ones and the independent sector appeared to be providing a good quality service at \nno additional cost. The authors urged caution in interpreting their findings, since the \nrelationship between agency type and cost was complicated by interactions between agency, \nservice quality and resident dependency. Public sector facilities accommodated people with \nhigher levels of need than private and voluntary sector facilities. This same pattern was \nevident from the study reported in this paper. \n \nOur new analyses confirm that patterns of service use are almost always varied, and that cost \ndifferences are inherent in all care systems. Such variations are clearly very relevant to \npolicy-makers and local commissioners as they seek to provide good quality services that \nmeet the Government\u2019s objectives of promoting independence, choice and inclusion. The \nquestion we were able to address in this study was whether the observed service use and cost \nvariations for people in care accommodation reflected the different needs of individual \nresidents (as measured by the severity of intellectual disability and behavioural problems), \nwhile also taking into account the possible effects of accommodation scale and sector. Our \nfinding that such associations were quite strong has relevance for local commissioning \nstrategies and, in the context of the Best Value principles, suggests a need for dependency-\ncontingent reimbursements in the contracts drawn up with providers (cf. Comas-Herrera et al. \n2001). The White Paper stresses that services for people with intellectual disabilities and \nchallenging behaviour should be commissioned on an individualised basis and should seek to \npromote inclusive lifestyles (Secretary of State for Health 2001 paragraph 8.43). Partnerships \nworking and person-centred planning are seen as key to the achievement of social inclusion. \n  \n 17\nOur findings therefore also have relevance in the context of this national policy commitment \nto person-centred planning.  \n \n \nREFERENCES  \n \nAudit Commission (2002) Supported Housing, Kensington and Chelsea (Royal Borough of). \nAudit Commission, London. \n \nAudit Commission (1993) Taking Care Bulletin.
