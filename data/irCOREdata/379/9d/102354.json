In this letter, by using Gaussian-Forcing (GF) technique,\nwe trade-off performance and complexity and it results in a\ndynamic Grouped GF (G-GF) CLi MUD technique. We show\nvia computer simulation, at the system with 200% condition,\nthe loss of approximately 0.3 dB compared to its brute-force\ncounterpart is observed while reducing the complexity to more\nthan half.\nIndex Terms\u2014 Low-density signature, synchronous overloaded\nCDMA, chip-level iterated MUD, dynamic user grouping,\nGaussian-forcing technique.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nEVERGROWING demand in contemporary communica-tion is to increase the capacity. In this letter, the ca-\npacity is understood as the user capacity, defined as the\nmaximum number of admissible users at any time-instants [1].\nFor interference-limited systems, e.g. Code-Division Multiple\nAccess (CDMA) systems, the soft limit of the user capacity,\nin memoryless channel, is the processing gain, defined as N .\nLet K and \u03b2 = K\/N be the number of users in the system\nand the system loading, respectively. The system is called,\nunderloaded, fully-loaded, and overloaded (or oversaturated),\nwhen the \u03b2 is lower than, equal to, and bigger than 1,\ncorrespondingly.\nThe interference in CDMA systems is caused by the non-\northogonality of the (received) signatures, which can be over-\ncome by using extensive signal processing on the signal space,\nfor instance by using Multiuser Detection [2]. Nevertheless,\noverloaded condition possess a different problem as it makes\nat least two signatures to be linearly-dependent. This is the\nexact problem where most MUD technique simply fails to\ncope with even to meet a basic reliable communication, i.e.\nthe Bit-Error Rate vanishes as the noise approaches zero.\nCombined with optimum Spreading Signature for over-\nloaded condition, namely Welch-Bound-Equality (WBE)\nbased signatures [3], Optimum MUD, for example Minimum\nA Posteriori Probability (MAP) detector, can be used but its\ncomplexity prevent its practical implementation. Linear MUD,\nfor instance Minimum Mean-Squared Error (MMSE) detector,\nManuscript received November 17, 2007.

In\nthis letter, we concentrate a new technique that reduces the\ncomplexity of the MAP-based CLi MUD without losing too\nmuch of performance.\nII. SYSTEM MODEL\nConsider an uncoded (N,K) symbol-synchronous CDMA\nsystem for uplink transmission over AWGN channel. Let xk\nand Xk be, respectively, the transmitted symbol with period\nof Ts and the constellation alphabet for user k. Without loss\nof generality and for notation brevity, all users are assumed\nto take their symbol from the same normalized constellation\nalphabet, i.e. Xk = X,\u2200k = 1, . . . ,K with unit average\nenergy. The received signal sampled at n-th chip is given by\nyn =\nK\u2211\nk=1\nhk,nxk + \u03bdn (1)\nwhere yn and \u03bdn \u223c CN (0, 1) are the received signal and\nthe circularly symmetric gaussian noise, respectively, sampled\nat n-th chip. The effective signature is denoted as hk,n =\nej\u03b8k\n\u221a\nsnrksk,n for k-th user sampled at and comprises the\ncomplex gain experience by the symbol due to spreading\n{sk,n}Nn=1, user\u2019s power snrk and the user-unique phase\nrotation \u03b8k.\nThe LDS structure works by switching-off a large number of\nspreading chips and with intelligent arrangement, the number\nof interfering users per chip is also reduced. Let \u03ben and \u03b6k be\nthe set of users participating in chip n and the set of chips\nover which user k spreads their symbol, respectively. Then,\nwith LDS structure, the received signal of (1) is\nyn =\n\u2211\nk\u2208\u03ben\nhk,nxk + \u03bdn. (2)\nIII. CHIP-LEVEL ITERATED MUD\nA. Canonical Form\nDenote G(U , C) as the underlying factor graph of un-coded\n(N , K) CDMA systems, where the users (k=1,. . . ,K) and the\nchips (n=1,. . . , N) are represented by variable nodes u \u2208 U\nand function nodes c \u2208 C, respectively. An edge e(k, n) exists\nif the received chip yn contains the symbol from user k and\nis shown as a line connecting variable node uk and function\nnode cn.\n1089-7798\/08$25.00 c\u00a9 2008 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Restrictions apply. \n168 IEEE COMMUNICATIONS LETTERS, VOL. 12, NO. 3, MARCH 2008\nThe generic form of CL iterated MUD can explained as\nfollow. Let Ljn\u2193(xk) and Ljn\u2191(xk) be the messages1 sent along\nedge en,k, at j-th iteration, from variable node uk to function\nnode cn and vice-versa, respectively. Assuming there is no a\npriori probabilities available, the initial messages (j = 0) are\nset to zeros: L0n\u2193(xk) = 0,\u2200k,\u2200n. The messages are updated\nusing the following rules:\nLjn\u2193(xk) =\n\u2211\nm\u2208\u03bek\\n\nLj\u22121m\u2191 (xk) (3)\nLjn\u2191(xk) = F\n(\nxk|yn,Ljn\u2193(xl),\u2200l \u2208 \u03b6k \\ k\n)\n(4)\nIt can be easily seen from (3) and (4), that all messages are\nrestricted to consist of only the extrinsic information [7].\nTo approximate the optimum MAP (or Log-MAP as the\nmessages are represented in their logarithmic-values) detector,\nas derived in [5], the function in (4) must calculate the local\nmarginalization and is given by\nF( \u2022 ) = log ( \u2211\nx[n]\u2208Xdc\nxk\npj(yn|x[n])\n\u220f\nl\u2208\u03ben\\k\nP jn(xl)\n)\n(5)\nwhere\npj(yn|x[n]) \u221d exp\n(\u2212 1\n(2\u03c32)\n\u2016yn \u2212 hT[n]x[n]\u20162\n) (6)\nP jn(xl) = exp\n(Ljn\u2193(xl)). (7)\nCombining (6) and (7) into (5), the message update is given\nby\nLjn\u2191(xk) \u221d max\u0003\nx[n]\u2208Xdc\nxk\n( \u2211\nl\u2208\u03ben\\k\nLjn\u2193(xl)\u2212\n1\n2\u03c32\n\u2016yn \u2212 hT[n]x[n]\u20162\n)\n(8)\nwhere max\u0003 = log\n(\nea+eb\n)\n= max(a, b)+ln\n(\n1+exp(\u2212|a\u2212\nb|2)) is the numerically stable function derived by using\nJacobian algorithm in [8]. By using local marginalization, this\ntechnique is termed CLi Log-MAP (LM) MUD. Furthermore,\nit is easy to see that, by utilizing local marginalization, the\ncomplexity of the receiver has been reduced so that it is\nexponential only to dc instead of to K, where dc \u0007 k.\nB. G-GF CLi MUD\nThe new Grouped-based technique operates in the chip-level\nand works by arranging the interfering users in a chip into\ntwo groups. Let G and G\u00af be sets of users for group 1 and\ngroup 2, correspondingly, such that G \u2229 G\u00af = \u2205. Furthermore,\n|G| and |G\u00af| denote the size of each group, respectively. The\nidea is to approximate the Log-Likelihood Ratio (LLR) of the\ninterference coming from other group as a single symmetric\nGaussian distributed, so that (2) can be re-written as\nyn =\n\u2211\nk\u2208G\nhk,nxk +\n\u2211\nl\u2208G\u00af\nhl,nxl + \u03bdn\n=\n\u2211\nk\u2208G\nhk,nxk +maiG,n + \u03bdn (9)\n1Message is defined as a vector comprising the reliability values of the\nadjacent variable node and is represented by its computationally efficient and\nstable Logarithmic-value.\nLet x\u02dck,n and Var{xk,n} be the mean and the variance of\nthe symbol xk when observing at chip rn, respectively, and\nare given by\nx\u02dck,n =\n\u2211\nxk\u2208X\nxkPn(xk) (10)\nVar(xk,n) =\n\u2211\nxk\u2208X\n\u2016xk\u20162Pn(xk)\u2212 \u2016x\u02dck,n\u20162. (11)\nThen, employing (10) and (11), when observing the users\nfrom group G, the cumulative statistics of interference from\nanother group G\u00af can written as\nE{maiG,n} =\n\u2211\nk\u2208G\u00af\nhk,nx\u02dck,n (12)\nVar(maiG,n) =\n\u2211\nk\u2208G\u00af\n\u2016hk,n\u20162Var(xk,n). (13)\nIn line with the investigation given in [9] that states parallel\nprocessing is more advantageous than serial processing where\nuser\/group ordering is much less sensitive, the same treatment\nis made when evaluating the group G\u00af.\nLet \u03c32G,n = \u03c32n + Var(maiG,n) be the cumulative noise\nvariance seen by users in group G. By using the above\nstatistics, the MAP-based CLi SISO MUD techniques can be\nsimplified. Denote x[G,n] and h[G,n] as the vectors comprising\nall users\u2019 symbols in group G and their corresponding effective\nsignature vector, respectively. By using the Log-MAP algo-\nrithm as the local observation function, (8) can be modified\naccording to the Gaussian approximation of the interferers and\nis given by\nLjn\u2191(xk) \u221d max\u0003\nx[n]\u2208X|G|\nxk\n( \u2211\nl\u2208G\\k\nLjn\u2193(xl)\u2212\n1\n2\u03c32G,n\n\u2016yn \u2212 hT[G,n]x[G,n] \u2212 E{maiG,n}\u20162\n)\n. (14)\nAssuming that the size of G is bigger than that of G\u00af, it\nis easy to see from (14) that the complexity of this new\ndetection is exponential to |G| < \u03ben instead of to \u03ben. Note\nthat, by forcing the interference from other group as single\nsymmetric Gaussian distribution when it is actually incorrect,\nsome performance loss is expected when this new technique\nis employed.\nMoreover, another key contribution to this G-GF CLi SISO\nMUD techniques is the utilization of dynamic random user\ngrouping that dynamically randomize\/shuffle the users from\nboth groups in every iteration. In other words, the users\ngrouping is done for every iteration and the exact same set\nof users are not allowed to form the same group during two\nconsecutive iterations. By doing that, the intra-relation that\nmay be developed between users in a group can be broken\ndown. In a way, it provides the extrinsic information in every\niteration to calculate the new message. And as stated in [10],\nthe extrinsic information can help increasing the optimality\nof MPA technique in the sense that it provides more search\nspace.\nC. Non-Linear Smoothing Process\nThe CLi MUD techniques given in previous sub-sections\nmay suffer from the oscillatory and, even, chaotic condition\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Effect of various group size and different user grouping strategy for\nG-GF CLi LM MUD.\n[11]. These phenomena emerge due to the failure of the\niterative receivers to reach its fixed points, i.e. the non-\nconvergent case. In this paper, we propose a simple non-linear\nsmoothing process to bound the future estimate such that it\nwill not lie too far from the previous estimations and is given\nby\nLjn\u2191(xk) \u221d\n(\n\u03b1Ljn\u2191(xk) + (1\u2212 \u03b1)Lj\u22121n\u2191 (xk)\n)\n(15)\nwhere \u03b1 is the smoothing coefficient. Note that the nor-\nmalization of the message shall be done before as well as\nafter the smoothing process. Furthermore, during our initial\ninvestigation, we have found out that for the same LDS scheme\nand the same CL iterative MUD technique, the smoothing\ncoefficients are not too sensitive to the SNR.\nIV. SIMULATION RESULTS\nThe regular LDS 60\u00d7 120 is designed to serve up to K =\n120 users with N = 60 chips with effective spreading dv = 3\nand number of interfering users in a chip dc = 6. Before, we\nshow the performance of the proposed G-GF CLi LM MUD,\nwe review the necessity of incorporating non-linear smoothing\nprocess into chip observation function.\nWe present the superiority of the dynamic user grouping\nwhen used in G-GF CLi LM MUD in Figure 1. Since the\nnon-linear smoothing process slows down the convergence, a\ngreater number of iteration is needed for the G-GF CLi LM\nMUD with smaller group size. Specifically shown in Figure 1,\nfor G-GF CLi LM MUD with |G| < 5, the maximum number\nof iteration is limited to 25, otherwise 15. Furthermore, it\nis also shown that the performance loss when G-GF CLi\nLM MUD with |G| = 3 is employed is approximately 0.3\ndB compared when brute-force CLi LM MUD is utilized.\nMoreover, by increasing the group size, as suggested by our\nresults, the performance should be improved. Interestingly, we\nalso observed that by employing dynamic grouping, G-GF CLi\nLM MUD witg |G| = 3 outperforms the G-GF CLi MUD\nemploying static grouping with |G| = 4.\nUnderstandably, when |G| is increased, the performance is\nalso improved because the search space becomes larger. Also,\ndue to the dynamic user grouping, all users basically will have\nthe same treatment.\nV. CONCLUSION\nThis letter studies the performance of a lower-complexity\nimplementation of CLi LM MUD by using Gaussian-Forcing\ntechnique. Trading-off the performance and complexity, a\nnew dynamic G-GF CLi LM MUD has been proposed and\nanalyzed. Our simulation confirms that the performance loss\nincurred due to having smaller group size can be justified given\nthe achieved complexity reduction.\nREFERENCES\n[1] D. Tse and S.
