It is by far most common in teen-\nagers and young adults, and typically caused by falls and\nmotor-vehicle collisions. The estimated population-based\nincident rate ranges above 600\/100000 [1].\nMTBI typically induces a range of symptoms such as:\nheadaches, blurred vision, poor concentration, sleep dis-\nturbance, depressed mood or irritability. These post-\ninjury effects are referred to as Post-Concussion Syndrome\n(PCS), a transient condition which is thought to reflect a\nfully recoverable disturbance of neural function [2-5].\nHowever, long beyond the typical recovery interval of one\nto three months, at least 15% of persons with a history of\nMTBI continue to see their GPs because of persistent prob-\nlems [6-10]. The clinical validity of these sequeale is not\nundisputed, in part because there is no readily evident\nphysiological damage or deficit that could be made\naccountable. Consequently, a range of alternative expla-\nnations such as involvement in litigation [1] and pre -\nmorbid psychological problems [11] are discussed. In\naddition, one may question the correctness of the\nassumption that MTBI is fully recoverable in all cases.\nThe view that MTBI leads to transient disturbances only is\nfurther supported by the absence of structural brain dam-\nage in diagnostic MRI images acquired with standard\nrecording sequences[12]. However, the combination of\nhigh resolution MRI with specifically tailored scanning\nprotocols provides evidence for microstructural abnor-\nmalities in MTBI patients [13-15]. Ultra-structural studies\nfurther indicate that MTBI may damage the structure of\nneurofilaments and cause traumatic axonal injury\n[16,17]. Together, these findings support the idea that\nMTBI can introduce primary structural damage in reaction\nto the axon misalignment, disconnection and swelling\nthat occurs in response to the physical forces inflicted on\nthe neural tissue [17-19]. It therefore appears plausible to\nassume that microstructural damage can persist, and that\nthis tissue damage may form the pathophysiological\nfoundation of the persisting sequeale some MTBI patients'\nexperience. This assumption gives rise to the hypotheses\nthat the neural damage affects information processing,\nand henceforth the prediction that only those MTBI\npatients who suffer chronic PCS symptoms show neu-\nrobehavioral deficits.\nThis idea is not new and various research groups have\nstudied the role of neurobehavioral performance in PCS.\nHowever, the existing data do not provide a coherent pic-\nture as to whether cognitive performance in longterm\nMTBI patients is disturbed or not, and if, to what extent\nsymptoms and performance are related. While some stud-\nies report a lack of evidence for sustained postconcussive\neffects of MTBI [20,21], others report general cognitive\ndeficits [22-24], as well as impairments in specific infor-\nmation processing domains such as attention [25,27],\nworking memory [26,27], and processing speed [28]. Two\nmeta-analyses highlight this empirical controversy and\ncome to the conclusion that the relationship between PCS\nand cognitive impairment is 'generally weak' [29,30].\nWe propose that the inconsistent findings on the relation-\nship of neurobehavioural performance and PCS might, in\npart, be due to the fact that most experiments investigated\nlong-term MTBI consequences by studying a cohort of\nMTBI participants without taking the status of PCS specif-\nically into account. However, it is clear that only a sub-\ngroup of MTBI patients continue to report PCS symptoms,\nand hence a separate assessment of MTBI patients with\nand without sustained PCS should provide a further\ninsight. The incoherent picture emerging from the litera-\nture represents a serious problem for both suffers and\nhealth care providers. For example, little diagnostic advice\nis provided for clinicians regarding the classification and\nprognosis of PCS, and ICD-10 suggests guidelines for\nresearch purposes only. Furthermore, the chronic effects\nof MTBI compromise quality of life and general well being\n[30], and given the high incident rate of MTBI, particularly\namongst young adults, the socio-economic consequences\nare drastic [2]. Henceforth there is a need to characterise\nand understand chronic MTBI effects. In this context, the\npresent experiment studied cognitive performance in a\ncohort of MTBI patients at least 12 month post-incident,\nwhereby those with and without PCS were studied sepa-\nrately. To control for potential confounding factors, all\nparticipants were in employment or studying at University\nand were not involved in any litigation.\nThe Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms Question-\nnaire (RPQ) [31] was used to categorise MTBI patients as\nthose with PCS (PCS+) and those without PCS (PCS-).\nThereby the categorisation criterion was based on ICD-10\nguidelines. The RPQ contains a list of symptoms com-\nmonly associated with PCS and participants are asked to\nrate the severity of each item on a scale from 0 - 4. Day-to-\nday cognitive function\/dysfunction was further measured\nwith the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (CFQ) [32].\nThe rationale for employing the CFQ as an additional\ndiagnostic tool was based on findings, which suggest that\ndisruptions of daily activities represent a significant corre-\nlate of the PCS symptomatic [33-35]. To establish the rela-\ntionship between subjectively experienced deficits and\nobjectively measurable indices, we further employed a\nseries of neurobehavioral measures. Based on the assump-\ntion that frontal lobe functions play a crucial role in mod-\nulating information processing and cognition, as well as\non previous evidence suggesting deficits in these domains\n[2,25], the Test of Attentional Performance (TAP) [36]Page 2 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Neurology 2006, 6:7 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2377\/6\/7and the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated\nBattery expedio, (CANTABe) [37] were used. The principle\nstudy design was based on the rationale that only a sub-\ngroup of MTBI patients would have contained sustained\nPCS, presumably because of persistent microstructural\ndamage. We therefore predict that MTBI patients with PCS\nwould have lower performance scores on the objective\nmeasures than those without PCS and the control group.\nWe further hypothesize that PCS severity, indexed by the\nRPQ sum score and the CFQ, would correlate with the\nperformance indices reaction time and error rate.\nMethod\nParticipants\nThirty eight head injured and 38 healthy control partici-\npants, with a mean age of 23.8 and 23.1 years respectively,\nwere tested. The groups were further matched for handed-\nness, gender and education. Recruitment was conducted\nthrough advertisement posters, which invited persons\nwith MTBI as well as healthy controls to contact the labo-\nratory. Posters were distributed in 150 general practitioner\nsurgeries in Merseyside, a local Brain Injury Community\nCentre, and the University of Liverpool campus. Further\ninformation on group characteristics is summarised in\ntable 1.\nParticipants in the MTBI group were selected on the basis\nof 'the diagnostic protocol for Mild Traumatic Brain\nInjury' defined by The Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Commit-\ntee of the Head Injury Interdisciplinary Special Interest Group\nof the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine. Our\ninclusion criteria for the MTBI cohort comprised: (1) Loss\nof Consciousness < 30 mins; (2) Post Traumatic Amnesia\n< 24 hours; (3) alteration of mental state (dazed, disorien-\ntated, confused) at time of incident; and (4) one-off MTBI.\nMost importantly, participants were tested at least 12\nmonths post-incident. Only those who had not been\ninvolved in or considered litigation were included in the\nstudy. All participants were in employment or studying\nfor at least six month when tested.\nBoth the MTBI and the control cohort were screened for\ngeneral well-being, which included questions on mood,\ndepression and anxiety, sleep disturbances, previous psy-\nchological or neurological problems, medication, and\npain. Those with poor screening outcome were excluded\nfrom the experiment. The age range was set to 18\u201365\nyears. The study was approved by the South Sefton\nResearch Ethics Committee as well as the Ethics Commit-\ntee of the Psychology Department at the University of Liv-\nerpool, UK. Informed consent was taken prior to\nparticipation. The experiment was conducted in a neu-\nropsychological laboratory at the University of Liverpool.\nTesting took approximately 90 minutes. Participation was\nreimbursed at \u00a35\/hour.\nGroup allocation\nThe RPQ, a 16-item symptom list, which uses a rating\nscale of 0 to 4 (4 = maximal severity), was employed for\nthe categorisation and the quantification of PCS symp-\ntoms. The categorisation was based on the RPQ cut-off cri-\nterion (at least three items with severity ratings of 3 or\nhigher, [38]), and resulted in two sub-groups: participants\nwith PCS and participants without. This criterion was sat-\nisfied in 11 persons (PCS+group) all of whom had suf-\nfered MTBI. The criterion for PCS was not met in the\nremaining 27 participants of the MTBI group (PCS-, N =\n27) and all control participants (C, N = 38). To quantify\nTable 1: Participant Demographics: Age, National Adult Reading Test (NART) and chronicity values expressed as mean (\u00b1 1 standard \ndeviation).

This allowed us not only to\ncorrelate behavioural performance with PCS severity, but\nalso to study our data independent of the group categori-\nsation. The latter is particularly important since the typical\nPCS symptoms are non-specific and may also be experi-\nenced by healthy controls [39]. Therefore analyses based\non both, PCS categorisation and overall PCS symptom\nseverity, should enhance the interpretability of the\nacquired data.\nMeasures\nSubjective measures comprised the RPQ and the CFQ, a\nself-rating instrument designed to assess cognitive failures\nin perception, memory and motor function experienced\nin every-day life situations. It consists of 25 items which\nare rated for their frequency of occurrence from 0 to 4 (4\n= very often).\nCognitive functioning and performance was measured\nquantitatively with the two computer-based test batteries,\nTAP and CANTABe. These tests are specifically designed to\nassess differential deficits in frontal lobe function. They\ninvolve time\/accuracy tasks of varying complexity, which\nare presented in several subtests. In the TAP the response\nmode contains a simple button press. The CANTABe uses\na touch screen system with a response pen. In both tests,\nthe response was exercised with the dominant hand.\nFrom the TAP, the five subtests: Alertness (AL), Working\nMemory (WM), Divided Attention (DA), Go\/No go (GN),\nand Covert Shift of Attention (CS), were selected to assess\ndeficits in sustained attention, working memory, divided\nattention, selective attention and switching attention,\nrespectively. From the CANTABe the subsets: Big Little Cir-\ncle (BLC), Spatial Working Memory (SWM), Intra-Extra\nDimensional Set Shifting (IED), Reaction Time (RTI) and\nRapid Visual Information Processing (RVP) assessing shift-\ning\/selective attention, working memory, shifting atten-\ntion, sustained attention with a motor component and\nselective attention respectively. In addition we employed\nthe National Adult Reading Test [40] to obtain an estimate\nof the participants' IQ.\nProcedure\nThe assessment was conducted in a fully controlled envi-\nronment. Informed consent was taken prior to testing.\nData collection was split into two sections, completion of\nquestionnaires and administration of test batteries. The\norder of sections and the order of tests within sections was\nquasi-randomised and followed eight counterbalanced\norders. The NART data was collected after section one.\nDepending on the individual's needs, short rest periods\nwere interspersed between tests.\nAnalyses\nTwo-way repeated measure Anovas, comprising the fac-\ntors group (PCS+, PCS-, C) and subtest (AL, WM, DA, GN,\nCS, BLC, SWM, IED, RTI, RVP), were calculated for reac-\ntion times and error rates, respectively. Post-hoc group\ndifferences for individual subtests were assessed with\nunpaired t-tests. The relationship of test performance and\nPCS symptom severity was tested by calculating Pearson\ncorrelations between RPQ scores and reaction times\/error\nrates for each subtest. Standard statistics analysis software\n(SPSS 11.0, StatView 5.0.1) was used for all calculations.\nResults\nDemographical analyses\nAnalysis of demographic variables and NART scores\nrevealed no significant differences between groups. We\nfurther found that injury-related parameters, i.e. chronic-\nity, loss of consciousness or hospitalisation, did not differ\nsignificantly between PCS+\/PCS- groups (Table 1).\nReporting of PCS symptoms (RPQ & CFQ)\nThe ANOVA of RPQ sum scores revealed a significant\nmain effect group (F [2, 73] = 15.75, P < .01) which reflected\nhigher RPQ sum scores in the PCS+ group than in the PCS-\ngroup (mean difference = -15.1; critical difference: 6.8; P\n< .01) and the control group (mean difference = 14.5; crit-\nical difference: 7.1; P < .01). Most importantly, the differ-\nence between the PCS- and controls was insignificant. A\nsimilar result pattern was found for the CFQ. A main effect\ngroup (F [2,73] = 10.5, P < .01) indicated that participants\nin the PCS+ group experienced significantly more cogni-\ntive failures in their everyday life than controls (mean dif-\nference = -7.5, critical difference = 4; P < .01) and PCS-\n(mean difference: 5.5, critical difference = 4.2; P < .01).\nAgain, the post-hoc contrast between controls and the\nPCS- group was insignificant.\nGroup means for individual RPQ itemsFigure 1\nGroup means for individual RPQ items. The figure illustrates \nthat RPQ ratings are generally higher for PCS+ than for PCS-\nand Controls.Page 4 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Neurology 2006, 6:7 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2377\/6\/7An item x group interaction (F[30, 1095] = 2.9, P < .01) fur-\nther indicated that the majority of symptoms were experi-\nenced significantly more often in the PCS+ group. Post-\nhoc analysis of the latter revealed no group differences for\nthe items: restlessness, double vision, light sensation,\nblurred vision, nausea, and dizziness, while all other RPQ\nsymptoms were experienced significantly more frequently\nin the PCS+ than the two other groups (PCS-\/controls).\nThe effect is illustrated in figure 1.\nNeurobehavioral test data (TAP and CANTABe)\nAnalysis of error scores revealed a significant group (F[2, 73]\n= 5.0, P <.01) and group x subtest interaction (F[22, 803] =\n2.6; P < .01, GG corrected). The main effect is depicted in\nfigure 2. Post-hoc analysis of the main effect showed that\nerror rates were significantly higher in the PCS+ group as\ncompared to the PCS- group (mean difference = 4.0, criti-\ncal difference = 3.1; P < .01) and controls (mean differ-\nence = -3.0, critical difference = 3.0; P <.05). Unpaired\npost-hoc t-tests further revealed significant group differ-\nences between PCS+ and PCS- for DA (t(36) = 2.6, P <.05),\nWM (t(36) = 3.0; P < .01) and RTI (t(36) = 2.2; P < .05), as\nwell as a trend for SWM (t(36) = 1.8; P =.09). The Anova of\nRTs revealed no significant effects.\nCorrelation analysis\nThe correlations of subtest performance with the RPQ\nsum scores are summarized in table 2. In the PCS+ group,\nsignificant correlations were found for 12 out of the 24\nsubtest scores. In all these cases symptom severity was\npositively correlated with test performance (table 2 and\nfigure 3). 22 out of the 24 correlations were insignificant\nin the PCS- group and none of the correlations were signif-\nicant in controls.\nDiscussion\nThe present experiment was designed to further our\nunderstanding of chronic effects following mild head\ninjuries, which remains a largely controversial but equally\nimportant public health issue. More specifically, we\naimed to characterize sustained PCS and its neurobehav-\nioural concomitants within a group of long term MTBI\nsufferers. Thereby, a dissociation of PCS symptomatic and\nMTBI was introduced through group allocation methods.\nBy and large, previous research has failed to produce a\nclear picture on sustained PCS, mainly because the major-\nity of these experiments did not distinguish between MTBI\nparticipants with and without PCS. To this end, the\npresent experiment studied a group of participants who\nhad experienced a one-off MTBI at least twelve months\nprior to testing, and a matched control group, for PCS.\nIndexed by the RPQ cut-off criterion, 11 persons (29%) in\nthe MTBI cohort were found to suffer from sustained PCS\n(PCS+), while the remaining 27 persons (71%) showed\nsimilar RPQ scores to healthy control participants. In\naddition, cognitive failures in everyday situations were\nreported more frequently in the PCS+ group as compared\nto participants in the PCS- and healthy control groups.\nThese results have two main implications. First, they high-\nlight that mild head injury leads to a chronically elevated\nlevel of PCS symptoms in some persons with MTBI, while\nin others the experienced symptom level is no different\nfrom persons who did not have an MTBI. Second, they\nindicate that neurobehavioral deficits are related to high\nlevels of PCS symptoms but not the MTBI per se. Most\nimportantly, these findings were obtained by using a cut-\noff criterion in the RPQ for the initial group allocation,\nbut the RPQ sum score, i.e. the complete RPQ symptom\nprofile, for all subsequent analysis.\nOur study further revealed interesting results on the role\nof loss of consciousness in sustained PCS and\/or its sever-\nity. According to ICD - 10, a 'history of head trauma with\nloss of consciousness preceding the onset of symptoms by\na period of up to four weeks' represents one of the diag-\nnostic criteria (criterion 'B'). However, in our experiment\n4 out of 11 participants in the PCS+ group (36%) had not\nexperienced loss of consciousness but nevertheless satis-\nfied all other PCS criteria. At the same time, 14 out of 27\nparticipants (52 %) in the PCS- group had lost conscious-\nness during the incident but did not develop chronic PCS.\nThis is consistent with other studies [41,42], where PCS\nwas found in the absence of loss of consciousness. Most\nnotably in this context, Umile et al. [15] recently reported\nthat participants with PCS performed poorer in neuropsy-\nchological tests and showed structural abnormalities in\nhigh-resolution MR scans after MTBI without loss of con-\nsciousness. Together, these and our findings provide ini-\ntial evidence that a critical re-evaluation of the loss of\nconsciousness criterion in ICD-10 may be considered. Of\nMain effect group for % errorsFigure 2\nMain effect group for % erors.Page 5 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Neurology 2006, 6:7 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2377\/6\/7course one may argue that our findings on loss of con-\nsciousness are of questionable reliability, due to the cir-\ncumstances under which the majority of incidents occur.\nHowever, the patient themselves typically remain the only\nsource of information, henceforth the subjectively per-\nceived loss of consciousness - whether it was truly experi-\nenced or not - is probably of limited diagnostic value.\nA further aim of the present study was concerned with\ncharacterizing potential neurobehavioral correlates of sus-\ntained PCS. Based on the hypothesis that mild brain inju-\nries may involve minimal structural damage, we\npresumed that sustained PCS should be reflected in\ndiminished performance during cognitive tasks. To this\nend, a correlational analysis of test performance and\nsymptom severity, indexed by the RPQ scores, revealed\npositive correlations with error rates for 50% of the neu-\nrobehavioral subtests in the PCS+ group. Thus, our data\nclearly suggests that PCS severity is associated with objec-\ntively measurable performance deficits in some cognitive\ntasks. These results highlight the fact that only those MTBI\nparticipants who suffer from PCS show deficits in cogni-\ntive processing, and provide further evidence that the level\nof PCS severity and not the experience of MTBI per se is\nthe critical factor. The findings obtained by the correla-\ntional analysis have further importance with regards to\nthe often criticized 'unspecific everyday' nature of the RPQ\nsymptom checklist. Studies have shown non-clinical\ngroups to report symptoms similar to those with PCS (e.g.\n[39]), which led to claims that the RPQ is an unreliable\nmeasure for PCS diagnosis (e.g. [43,44]). However, the\nabsence of a systematic relationship between RPQ and\ncognitive performance indices in the PCS-\/control groups,\nbut highly correlated scores in the PCS+group found in the\npresent study, identify the RPQ as a valid diagnostic meas-\nure despite the unspecific nature of checklist items [4].\nThe assessment of neurocognitive function revealed sig-\nnificantly poorer response accuracy in the PCS+ group\nthan in PCS- and controls, but no systematic effects for\nreaction time. This leaves three possible explanations.\nOne could either conclude that persisting PCS is unlikely\nto affect a person's speed of response to stimuli, that RT\nnon-result is due to low test power and thus an effect of\nTable 2: Pearson's Correlation Coefficient values are presented for all subtests (RT = Reaction Time and %E = Error) correlated with \nRPQ score.

The\nlatter explanation is strongly supported by Potter et al.\n[24], who suggested that some people with MTBI have\nheightened anxiety in novel testing situations, because of\nfears that their performance is affected by their condition.\nBivariate scattergrams relating to the significant correlations of symptom severity and performance parametersF gure 3\nBivariate scattergrams relating to the significant correlations of symptom severity and performance parameters.

Peloso [44] further argues that\nthe simultaneous management of response accuracy and\nresponse speed becomes less efficient when the cognitive\nload exceeds a certain threshold level, and that this level\nmay be lower following minor brain damage. This idea is\nwell compatible with our finding that the highest error\nrates were found for the subtests with greatest cognitive\ndemand. Furthermore, cognitive and emotional problems\nare known to persists longer after the incident than\nsomatic symptoms [45]. In line with this observation, the\nRPQ symptom profile shows that the experienced symp-\ntoms in the PCS+ group relate mostly to cognitive process-\ning, with poor concentration and irritability receiving the\nhighest scores.\nA continuing controversy in the discussion of chronic PCS\nconcerns other contributing factors such as malingering\n[11,46-49]. These concerns are partly driven by the lack of\nclear evidence for objectively measurable correlates of\nPCS. We cannot totally rule out the possibility of malin-\ngering or other contributing factors to our findings. How-\never, this influence is probably of negligable magnitude\nfor several reasons. First and foremost, participants\ninvolved in litigation of any kind were excluded from the\nstudy. Secondly, our volunteers were in employment or\nstudying, and generally in good health and spirits. Finally,\nthe severity of PCS symptoms systematically varied with\nthe level of performance across a range cognitive tasks,\nand such a data distribution across a group is unlikely to\nbe explained by malingering or exaggerated responses in\nthe RPQ.\nThe research hypotheses of the present paper were based\non the assumption that mild head injury can cause perma-\nnent microstructural damage and disturbances of neural\nfunction. As a result, information processing may become\nless efficient or more effortful and lead to deficits in neu-\nrobehavioral performance. Of course the question regard-\ning the neural origin and mechanisms underlying\nsustained PCS are not addressed in the present study,\nhowever the data is in line with these ideas. Only a sub-\ngroup of MTBI participants show PCS symptoms, cogni-\ntive failures in everyday situations and diminished\nneurobehavioural performance in standardized test bat-\nteries. This neuroscience-based interpretation of our data\nmight be challenged by the view that sustained PCS is\ndriven by psychological factors rather than structural con-\nsequences of brain damage [45,53,54]. For example, Van\nZomeren [55] and Wong [56] argued that PCS related\nsymptoms may be manifested to compensate for 'behav-\nioural faults' which patients attribute to the head injury.\nWhile this theory could explain why common complaints\nreported in the PCS+ group are more psychological in ori-\ngin than somatic, it falls short of a plausible explanation\nfor the strong correlation of objectively measurable per-\nformance indices and symptom severity.\nIn conclusion, the present study demonstrates a link\nbetween chronic PCS and neurobehavioral performance\nwith a study design that controlled for the influence of\nMTBI per se. Our results are in line with some of the liter-\nature on long-term consequence of mild head injuries,\nand particularly highlight the role neuropsychological\nconcomitants. Mild head-injuries are not always to be as\nmild as the name would suggest, and long-term conse-\nquence may very well have a neural underpinning.\nCompeting interests\nThe author(s) declare that they have no competing inter-\nests\nAuthors' contributions\nAS hold overall responsibility for the study.
