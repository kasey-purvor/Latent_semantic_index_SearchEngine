INTRODUCTION \nT is well known that perfect signal reconstruction can be \nachieved simply by adding all subband signals, if a set of \nallpass complementary filters is employed in the analysis \nprocedure [1]. Thus, the use of these filters can save substantial \nimplementation cost (see, [1], [4]-[9]). For this reason, it has \nfound many applications in different engineering disciplines, \nsuch as in sigma-delta A\/D converter designs [2], audio coders \n[3], speech scramblers [3] and loudspeaker crossovers [5]-[6]. \nThe most common existing design methods of \ncomplementary filters are based on the interconnections of \nsome allpass functions [4]-[9]. Although the designed filters are \nrobust to coefficient quantization, these methods are developed \n \nManuscript received August 7, 2003; revised November 26, 2003.

To address these problems, a \ncosine modulation approach [15] was proposed. Although the \nformulation in [15] could control the amount of passband and \nstopband ripples of the prototype filter, the allpass \ncomplementary specification for the overall structure may not \nbe satisfied. Moreover, as the optimization problem formulated \nin [15] is not a convex problem, the quasi Netwon algorithm \nonly gives the local optimal solution, which depends on the \ninitial condition selected. \nTo address this problem, in this paper, the exact allpass \ncomplementary requirement is relaxed to a near allpass \ncomplementary requirement. This near allpass complementary \nspecification as well as the passband and stopband \nspecifications for the individual filters are together expressed as \ninequality continuous constraints in the frequency domain. Our \nobjective is to minimize the sum of the ripple energy for the \nindividual filters, subject to those inequality continuous \nconstraints. The optimal near allpass complementary filter \ndesign problem is formulated as a quadratic semi-infinite \nprogramming problem. Two common approaches to tackle this \nproblem are the discretization method followed by the \nsemi-definite programming [10] and the application of the \nRemez-exchange algorithm [11]. However, these methods are \nnot effective for the nonuniform near allpass complementary \nFIR filter design. For the discretization method followed by the \nsemi-definite programming, it is not guaranteed that the \nconstraints will be satisfied in between the discretization points; \nalthough the deviation from the constraints can be reduced by \nincreasing the number of discretization points, increasing the \nnumber of constraints will aggravate the complexity of the \nproblem. For the Remez-exchange algorithm, the solution \nobtained converges to the global optimal solution if and only if \nDesign of Nonuniform Near Allpass \nComplementary FIR Filters via a Semi-infinite \nProgramming Technique \nCharlotte Yuk-Fan Ho, Member, IEEE, Bingo Wing-Kuen Ling, Yan-Qun Liu, Peter Kwong-Shun \nTam, Member, IEEE, Kok-Lay Teo, Senior Member, IEEE \nI \n> Paper ID: T-SP-01515-2003.R2 < \n \n2 \nthere are N+1 local extrema with alternating signs (N is the \norder of the filters) and these local extrema are all equal in \nabsolute value [11]; although this necessary and sufficient \ncondition is satisfied for the equiripple filter design problem, \nthis is not satisfied for the nonuniform near allpass \ncomplementary FIR filter design problem, and so the overall \nperformance of the filter banks would not be optimized, and \nhence, we cannot guarantee the existence of the optimal \nsolution. On the other hand, for the dual parameterization \napproach [12]-[14], the semi-infinite programming problem is \nreduced to a sequence of approximating sub-problems followed \nby a non-linear finite programming problem. Each of the \napproximating sub-problems can be readily solved using \nquadratic programming. The finite non-linear program\u2019s global \nsolution can then be obtained from the approximate solution. If \nthe feasible set is nonempty, then an optimal solution is \nguaranteed no matter what the initial condition is. Besides, as \nthe constraint is expressed as a matrix inequality, it is very \nflexible to include the nonuniform near allpass complementary \nconstraint or other constraints in the design problem by \nincreasing the number of rows in the corresponding matrix and \nvector. Furthermore, as we have developed an efficient \nalgorithm for implementing this dual parameterization method \n[12]-[14], in which the algorithm only involves initialization, \ncomputing the local minimum and computing the global \nminimum, so it is simple to use. \nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we \nformulate the design problem as a linear quadratic semi-infinite \nprogramming problem. In Section III, design examples are \npresented and solved. Section IV concludes the paper. \n \nII. PROBLEM FORMULATION \nTo avoid phase distortions, we assume that the frequency \nresponses of the filters are symmetric and can be expressed as: \n\uf0e5\n\uf03d\n\uf02b\uf03d\niN\nk\nkiii kaaH\n1\n,0, )cos(2)( \uf077\uf077\n, for 1,,1,0 \uf02d\uf03d Ni \uf04c , (1) \nwhere 12 \uf02biN  is the order of the filter \uf028 \uf029\uf077iH , and kia , , for \n1,,1,0 \uf02d\uf03d Ni \uf04c , are the real coefficients to be designed. Let \nthe passbands and stopbands of \uf028 \uf029\uf077iH  be, respectively, \ndenoted by p\niB  and \ns\niB , for 1,,1,0 \uf02d\uf03d Ni \uf04c . Assume that the \ndesired frequency responses are, for 1,,1,0 \uf02d\uf03d Ni \uf04c : \n\uf0ee\n\uf0ed\n\uf0ec\n\uf0ce\n\uf0ce\n\uf03d\ns\ni\np\ni\nd\nB\nB\nH\ni \uf077\n\uf077\n\uf077\n0\n1\n)( . (2) \nLet \n\uf05b \uf05dTNNNN Naaaa 10 ,10,1,00,0 ,,,,,, \uf02d\uf02d\uf02d\uf0ba \uf04c\uf04c\uf04cx , (3) \nwhere the superscript \nT\n denotes the transpose. The sum of the \nripple energy for the individual filter in the passband and \nstopband can be expressed as: \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf0e5 \uf0f2\n\uf02d\n\uf03d\n\uf02d\uf0ba\n1\n0\n2\n)()(\nN\ni BB\ndi\ns\ni\np\ni\ni\ndHHJ\n\uf055\n\uf077\uf077\uf077x . (4) \nUsing an argument similar to that given in Appendix B of [14], \nwe can show that there exist a positive definite matrix Q , a \nvector b  and a scalar p  such that: \n\uf028 \uf029 pJ TT \uf02b\uf02b\uf03d xbxQxx\n2\n1 . (5) \nFor details, see Appendix B of [14]. \nNext, we consider the specifications, expressed as a set of the \ncontinuous inequality constraints, to be imposed. Let the bounds \non the passband and stopband ripples of the filter be, \nrespectively, \nip\n\uf064  and \nis\n\uf064 , for 1,,1,0 \uf02d\uf03d Ni \uf04c . Then the \ncontinuous inequality constraints are: \nii pdi\nHH \uf064\uf077\uf077 \uf0a3\uf02d )()( , for piB\uf0ce\uf077  and for 1,,1,0 \uf02d\uf03d Ni \uf04c , (6) \nand \nii sdi\nHH \uf064\uf077\uf077 \uf0a3\uf02d )()( , for siB\uf0ce\uf077  and for 1,,1,0 \uf02d\uf03d Ni \uf04c . (7) \nBy shifting and scaling the frequency bands, all the filters with \ndifferent bandwidths can be transformed into a lowpass filter \nwith the same bandwidth. Hence, by combining those \nconstraints in a matrix formulation, the constraints can be \nfurther expressed as: \n)(~)(\n~\n\uf077\uf077 ff cxA \uf0a3 , for \npB0\uf0ce\uf077 , (8) \nwhere \uf028 \uf029)(,),(),(diag)(\n~\n110 \uf077\uf077\uf077\uf077 \uf02d\uf03d Nf AAAA \uf04c  and \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf05b \uf05dTNNf 1210 ,,,,\n~\n\uf02d\uf02d\uf03d \u03b4\u03b4\u03b4\u03b4c \uf04c\uf077  for \npB0\uf0ce\uf077 , in \nwhich )(\uf077iA  and i\u03b4  consist of respectively, cosine functions \nand the specifications for the passband and stopband ripples. \nNow define the allpass complementary constraint as: \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 a\nN\ni\ni AH \uf064\uf077\uf077 \uf0a3\uf02d\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf0e5\n\uf02d\n\uf03d\n1\n0\n, for \uf05b \uf05d\uf070\uf070\uf077 ,\uf02d\uf0ce , (9) \nwhere \uf028 \uf029\uf077A  is an allpass function and \na\uf064  is the upper bound \nfor the absolute difference between the sum of the filter \nresponses and the allpass function. Similarly, the constraint \ndefined in (9) can be expressed as: \n)(~)(\n~\n\uf077\uf077 rr cxA \uf0a3 , for \npB0\uf0ce\uf077 , (10) \nwhere \nT\nN\nN\nN\nN\nr \uf0fa\n\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\n\uf0eb\n\uf0e9\n\uf0f7\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6 \uf02d\n\uf02d\uf0f7\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6 \uf02d\n\uf03d\n\uf062\n\uf061\uf077\n\uf062\n\uf061\uf077\n\uf077 \u03be\u03beA ,)(\u02c6  and \nT\nN\nN\na\nN\nN\nar AA \uf0fa\n\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\n\uf0eb\n\uf0e9\n\uf0f7\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6 \uf02d\n\uf02d\uf0f7\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6 \uf02d\n\uf02b\uf03d\n\uf062\n\uf061\uf077\n\uf064\n\uf062\n\uf061\uf077\n\uf064\uf077 ,)(c\u02c6 , in which \n)(\uf077\u03be , N\uf061  and N\uf062  are respectively, the kernels of the filters, \nthe amount of frequency shift and the scaling factor for the \nbandwidth. Hence, the near allpass complementary FIR filter \ndesign problem can be formulated as the following linear \nquadratic semi-infinite programming problem: \nProblem (P) \nx\nmin  \uf028 \uf029 pJ TT \uf02b\uf02b\uf03d xbxQxx\n2\n1 , (11) \nsubject to 0cxAxg \uf0a3\uf02d\uf03d )()(),( \uf077\uf077\uf077 , for pB0\uf0ce\uf077 , (12) \nwhere \n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0eb\n\uf0e9\n\uf03d\n)(\u02c6\n)(\u02c6\n)(\n\uf077\n\uf077\n\uf077\nr\nf\nA\nA\nA  and \uf0fa\n\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\n\uf0eb\n\uf0e9\n\uf03d\n)(\u02c6\n)(\u02c6\n)(\n\uf077\n\uf077\n\uf077\nr\nf\nc\nc\nc . \nFor a fixed set of upper bound values for the passband and \nstopband ripples, as well as the allpass complementary error, the \ndesign procedure based on the dual parameterization given in \n> Paper ID: T-SP-01515-2003.R2 < \n \n3 \n[12]-[13] is used. The first part of the design procedure is to \nformulate the design problem as a semi-infinite programming \nproblem, referred to as Problem (P), as described above. Since \nthe algorithm for obtaining the solution of Problem (P) is stated \nin [12], the next part of the design procedure follows the steps \nstated in [12]. That is, first initialize a set of parameters, then \ncompute the local minimum of the finite problem. Finally, \ncompute the global minimum by implementing a local search \nfor the finite dual problem, and this global minimum \ncorresponds to the optimal solution of Problem (P). \nThe nonuniform near allpass complementary FIR filter design \nproblem is formulated as a semi-infinite programming problem, \nreferred to as Problem (P), and we have shown in [12]-[14] that \nthe solution for Problem (P) will converge to an exact optimal \nsolution satisfying all the required specifications if the KKT \nconditions are satisfied. Thus, the convergence of the dual \nparameterization method [12]-[14] to an exact optimal solution \nis guaranteed once the KKT conditions are satisfied. In order to \nsatisfy the KKT conditions, we need to guarantee that the \nfeasible set is nonempty. It is well known in the filter design \ntheory [16] that the magnitude specifications on the passband \nand stopband will be satisfied if the filter length is long enough. \nHence, the feasible solution is nonempty and KKT conditions \nare satisfied if the filter lengths of the filter are long enough. As \na result, the requirement for our algorithm to obtain an exact \noptimal solution is the sufficiently long filter lengths. \n \nIII. SIMULATION RESULTS \nFor comparison, consider the design example shown in [9]. \nThe specifications of the filters are as follows: (i) the cutoff \nfrequency of the lowpass filter is 0.2\uf070, that of the bandpass filter \nare 0.2\uf070 and 0.7\uf070, and that of the highpass filter is 0.7\uf070; (ii) the \npassband and stopband ripples of all the filters are bounded by \nthe values of -0.00043dB and -40dB, respectively. Assume the \ntransition bandwidths of all the filters be 0.05\uf070 and the allpass \nfunction be \uf028 \uf029 1\uf03d\uf077A  for \uf05b \uf05d\uf070\uf070\uf077 ,\uf02d\uf0ce . Let the maximum \nallowable allpass complementary error be 0151.0\uf03da\uf064 . We \nstart the design of the filters with the filter length 70\uf03diN  for \n2,1,0\uf03di . The responses of the filters and the allpass \ncomplementary error designed via our approach are, \nrespectively, plotted as solid lines in Figure 1 and Figure 2. The \nstopband ripple of the filters is just bounded by -42dB for the \ncase considered in [9], while it is about -100dB for our case. In \norder to illustrate the effectiveness of formulating the design \nproblem as a semi-infinite programming problem with the \ncontinuous constraint, the responses of the filters and the allpass \ncomplementary error designed with the same cost function but \nwithout the constraint are also plotted as dotted lines in, \nrespectively, Figure 1 and Figure 2. Although the ripple energy \nof the filters designed via our approach is higher than that of the \nunconstrained design, the allpass complementary error of our \ndesign is bounded by -36.4258dB, and that of the unconstrained \ndesign is just bounded by -34.4933dB, which does not satisfy \nthe required specification. By using our design, the specification \nis met and there is 1.9325dB improvement. \nConsider another design example with the specifications \ndefined as follows: (i) the cutoff frequency of the lowpass filter \nis 0.5\uf070, that of the bandpass filter are 0.5\uf070 and \n6\n5\uf070 , and that of \nthe highpass filter is \n6\n5\uf070 ; (ii) the passband and stopband ripples \nof the lowpass filter are bounded by the values of, respectively, \n0.0331 and 0.0330, that of the bandpass are, respectively, \n0.0378 and 0.0404, and that of the highpass filter are, \nrespectively, 0.0313 and 0.0366; (iii) the transition bandwidths \nof all the filters are 0.15 and the allpass function is \uf028 \uf029 1\uf03d\uf077A  for \n\uf05b \uf05d\uf070\uf070\uf077 ,\uf02d\uf0ce ; (iv) the maximum allowable allpass \ncomplementary error is 0189.0\uf03da\uf064 . We start the design of the \nfilters with the filter length 20\uf03diN  for 2,1,0\uf03di . The \nresponses of the filters and the allpass complementary error \ndesigned via our approach and the unconstrained approach are \nplotted as, respectively, solid lines and dotted lines in Figure 3 \nand Figure 4. By magnifying the band edges of the filters and the \nallpass complement error as shown in Figure 4, it can be seen \nclearly that the unconstrained case does not satisfy some of the \npassband and stopband specifications as well as the allpass \ncomplementary specification. On the other hand, the filters \ndesigned by our proposed method satisfy all the specifications. \nThe maximum allpass complementary error designed by our \nproposed method is bounded by -34.4904dB, which is \n1.0797dB lower than that obtained using the unconstrained \noptimization method. \n \nIV. CONCLUSION \nThe main contribution of this paper is the formulation of a \nnonuniform near allpass complementary FIR filters design \nproblem as a linear quadratic semi-infinite programming \nproblem. The dual parameterization algorithm was used to solve \nthis problem. The algorithm can find an exact optimal solution \nthat satisfies the passband and stopband specifications and \nmeets the allpass complementary specification if the solution \nexists.  \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENT \nThe work obtained in this paper was supported by a research \ngrant (project number G-YD26) from the Hong Kong \nPolytechnic University, the Centre for Multimedia Signal \nProcessing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, the CRGC \ngrant (project number PolyU 5101\\01E) from the Research \nGrants Council of Hong Kong, as well as a research grant from \nAustralian Research Council.  \n \nREFERENCES \n[1] S.
