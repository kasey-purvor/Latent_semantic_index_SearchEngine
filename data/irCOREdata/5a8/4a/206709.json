Regulatory compliance costs are a key concern of all parties \u2013 from pro-\nviders of front-line services to those developing new pharmaceutical products.\nRegulation, moreover, affects a myriad of activities, from the marketing of\ndrugs to the supply of human organs. It is important, accordingly, to consider\nwhether governments provide regulatory systems that are user friendly, condu-\ncive to certainty, and protective of relevant interests.\nLooking at the United Kingdom regulatory environment, it is clear that these\nare interesting times. A number of changes are taking place, which may involve\nuncertainties for the health sector as much as for others. Most notably, the\nperiod 2005\u201306 is seeing a fundamental shift of the UK Government\u2019s rhetoric\non regulation. The \u2018better regulation\u2019 movement is giving way to the \u2018regulatory\nreduction\u2019 rallying cry, and, as a result, British regulators now have to deal with\na number of difficult messages from central government. It is worth outlining\nhow this position has been arrived at and how this places modern regulation\nunder considerable stress.\nThe \u2018better regulation\u2019 thrust within UK Government can be traced back to\n1997. Before that time the prevailing concern was the Thatcherite desire to\nderegulate. In 1997, however, the switch from the language of \u2018deregulation\u2019\nto that of \u2018better regulation\u2019 was made. Dr David Clarke, Chancellor of the\nDuchy of Lancaster, argued: \u2018Deregulation implies regulation is not needed. In\nfact good regulation can benefit us all \u2013 it is only bad regulation that is a\nburden\u2019 (Cabinet Office, 1997).\nThe better regulation agenda was pressed forward by the Better Regulation\nTask Force (which was established in 1997), the Regulatory Impact Unit\nwas set up at the Cabinet Office, Regulatory Reform Ministers were appointed\nin each department of state, and a Ministerial Panel for Regulatory Account-\nability was created in order to improve the regulatory system. The UK\u2019s \u2018better\nregulation\u2019 rhetoric echoed that encountered in the European Union and the\nOECD, and the way to ensure better regulation was seen in terms of the need\nto develop and apply a series of regulatory improvement tools and policies.\nCentral amongst the tools was Regulatory Impact Assessment \u2013 a process for\nthe cost\u2013benefit testing of new regulatory proposals.\n* Corresponding author: Professor Robert Baldwin, Department of Law, The London School of Eco-\nnomics and Political Science, Houghton Street, London WC2A 2AE, UK. Email: R.Baldwin@lse.ac.uk\n203\nIn March 2005, however, two important publications signalled a change\nin direction. The Better Regulation Task Force (BRTF) released its report,\n\u2018Regulation \u2013 Less is More\u2019 (Better Regulation Task Force, 2005a) and the\nHampton Review on \u2018Reducing administrative burdens\u2019 (Hampton, 2005) was\npublished.\nThe \u2018Less is More\u2019 Report (LIM) recommended the adoption of new steps to\nreduce administrative burdens on business, and, notably, it urged the introduc-\ntion of the following measures:\n\u0001 The new Dutch approach of introducing a target for reducing administrative\ncosts to businesses.\n\u0001 A \u2018one in, one out\u2019 rule for regulation, whereby new regulations have to be\nmatched by deregulatory measures.\nThe Hampton Review recommended that regulators as a whole should use\ncomprehensive risk assessments to concentrate resources on the areas that\nneed them most.\nThe Hampton recommendations were endorsed by the Government in the\nMarch 2005 budget speech, and, in November 2005, the Chancellor, Gordon\nBrown, wooed the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) Conference by\npromising to publish new legislation to ensure that there will be \u2018no inspection\nwithout justification, no form filling without justification, and no information\nrequirements without justification\u2019 (HM Treasury, 2005). Across government,\ndepartments have been told to set new targets for reducing (by fixed percen-\ntages) the information burdens that they impose on businesses.\nThe \u2018better regulation\u2019, \u2018less is more\u2019 and \u2018risk-based\u2019 messages involve a\nnumber of tensions, however, and these pose serious challenges for regulators\nin coming years. Three difficulties demand particular attention.\nBetter regulation versus smarter regulation\nThe thrust of better regulation is to improve regulation by testing it with tools\nsuch as Regulatory Impact Assessment. The lesson of the \u2018smart regulation\u2019\nphilosophy as expounded by Gunningham and Grabosky (1998),1 is that the\nbest regulatory systems involve optimal mixes of state controls, associational\n(or quasi-regulatory) controls and corporate constraints (i.e. controls within\nthe corporation); and that mixtures of less coercive and more coercive regula-\ntory instruments should be employed with an emphasis on less punitive, less\nformal controls as first options. Smart regulation thus envisages a movement\naway from restrictive, rule-based, \u2018command and control\u2019 regimes towards\nthose that place more emphasis on alternative, less coercive methods as\napplied by a variety of institutions \u2013 be they regulators, professional bodies,\nor companies\/service providers themselves.\n1 See also Baldwin (2005).\n204 R O B E R T B A L D W I N\nThe tension between better regulation and smart regulation is that better\nregulation gives centrality of place to regulatory impact assessment (RIA),\nwhereas smart regulation advocates complex policy mixes and \u2018softer\u2019 styles\nof control that are extremely difficult to put through a RIA process. Such mixes\nare almost impossible to evaluate numerically in terms of costs and benefits\nbecause of their multi-instrumental and multi-institutional complexity. Any\nproponent of a new regulatory system who knows that a RIA process has to\nbe negotiated will have a huge disincentive to put forward a smart regime and\nan almost irresistible imperative to opt for something closer to an old-\nfashioned command and control system. On the one hand, the Government\nadvocates the use of more imaginative, \u2018alternative\u2019 and less restrictive\napproaches to regulation (Better Regulation Task Force, 2005b), whilst, on\nthe other hand, it evaluates regulatory proposals with a process that is almost\nwholly unsympathetic to such approaches.\nBetter regulation versus less regulation\nThe Government is now keener than ever to avoid imposing new burdens\non businesses. It wants to reduce quite significantly the burdens of supplying\ninformation that regulators impose on them. It also wants regulators to\ntarget their enforcement activities more precisely in order to take up less\nbusiness time. The problems are, first, that targeting enforcement demands\nthat inspections and other actions are based on intelligence, and second,\nthat, if the obligations of businesses or health care bodies to supply information\nto regulators are reduced, it is increasingly difficult for regulators to engage\nin targeting without generating intelligence independently. Such independent\ngeneration of data may, of course, prove hugely expensive for regulators \u2013\nindeed far more expensive for them than for the businesses\/health care\nbodies that they are controlling (who may have the information quite readily\nto hand).\nThere is, indeed, a further danger in the burden-reducing policy thrust.\nThis is that the potential savings made are likely to be hugely exaggerated\nand that the costs will be underplayed. This is likely to occur in the following\nway. If a business or health care body is asked to state what it costs to tell\nthe regulator how often it changes the filters on a ventilation system, it is liable\nto look to the staff time and other resources spent in keeping records. Such costs\nare considerably more than those of e-mailing the records to the regulator.\nLet us suppose the record keeping costs are \u00a35,000 a year and the e-mailing\ncosts \u00a320 per year. The burden-cutting saving is liable to be calculated at\n\u00a35,020 per year. In fact the real saving is only \u00a320 because the record keeping\nneeds to be carried out as part of routine management. If, moreover, the\nobligation to supply the records is removed (in order to achieve the hoped-\nfor \u00a35,020 saving), the regulator will have to make investigations to\nuncover the relevant data. Those investigations will cost considerably more\nthan \u00a320.\nBetter regulation in troubled times 205\nBetter regulation versus risk regulation\nRisk-based regulation involves a targeting of enforcement at those businesses or\nservice providers who pose greatest risks. As such, risk-based systems offer the\nprospect of a more efficient and less intrusive system of control than regimes\nthat adopt, say, blanket or reactive approaches. Dangers arise, however, when\nministers make statements that lead businesses or health care bodies to believe\nthat all inspections will be justified according to risk assessments. A central\nsuch danger is that risk-based systems tend to be blind to new risks and risk\ncreators. They make risk assessments on the basis of a given set of information\non risks and their creators and, as a result, their inspection processes are locked\ninto a focus on those risks and risk creators. They do not look to new hazards\nor new actors because these do not develop risk scores on the extant system (it\nwas for such reasons that the Hampton Review suggested that risk-based\nsystems should always be combined with a process of random inspection). It\nis random inspection (or another enforcement approach) that will uncover\nnew issues, not the risk-based system. Regulators and ministers, accordingly,\nshould be slow to assure businesses, health care bodies or others that all\ninspections will be based on prior evidence of risk.\nConclusions: regulation and health care\nThese are, indeed, extremely interesting times for regulation, and particularly\nfor regulators. Within government there exist a number of vigorous policy\nthrusts, but these are not in complete harmony and many regulators may fear\nthat they are being asked to straddle a number of horses. An optimistic view\nof recent developments is that the Government is shaking up regulation and\nthat, together with current concerns about burdens, this is likely to produce\nmore effective, \u2018lighter-touch\u2019 controls than were encountered formerly. The\npessimistic analyst may, however, suggest that obsessions with Regulatory\nImpact Assessments, burden reductions, and risk-based enforcement systems\nare likely to stand in the way of user-friendly regulation, and that these obses-\nsions may increase regulatory compliance costs and lower the levels of protec-\ntion that are currently found across economic and social activity. In the\nhealth sector, as in other areas, a particular worry may be that tensions within\nand between regulatory strategies tend to produce uncertainties unless they are\nhandled astutely. Such uncertainties affect not only the ability of health service\nproviders to plan investments \u2013 they also impact on compliance costs, the\ndevelopment of new products or services, and the welfare of patients. The UK\nGovernment may eventually manage to resolve the tensions discussed above,\nbut many health sector participants will be watching the regulatory climate\nwith some anxiety over the next few years.\nReferences\nBaldwin, R.
