Introduction 1 \nWaste management practices are rapidly changing and adapting in a number of 2 \ncountries as legislative and economical drivers incentivise more sustainable options such 3 \nas reduction of landfill disposal and recovery of valuable resources.  In Europe the 4 \nmanagement, treatment and disposal of  waste materials are governed and influenced by a 5 \nnumber of European Union legislations including the Waste Framework Directive 6 \n(Council of the European Union, 2008), the Landfill Directive (Council of the European 7 \nUnion, 1999) and the Waste Incineration Directive (Council of the European Union, 8 \n2000).   These directives are adopted at national levels within each of the EU member 9 \nstates; and to establish realistic and achievable waste strategy targets, including recycling 10 \nrates, an accurate understanding of waste composition and arisings are required (Burnley, 11 \n2007a). 12 \nIn Europe,  national and international targets have been set up for waste recycling, 13 \nrecovery and diversion from landfill (Burnley et al., 2007), which combined contribute to 14 \nan integrated waste management system (Grosso et al., 2010). Understanding the quantity 15 \nand composition of a waste stream produced is important in establishing quantities of 16 \npotential recyclable materials  and implementation of improved collection regimes; also 17 \nto forecast future waste generation in given regions (Parfitt and Flowerdew, 1997).  The 18 \ncomposition and variation of wastes is also important in the design of suitable sorting and 19 \nresidual treatment technologies (Burnley, 2007b), of which includes energy recovery 20 \nprocesses (Wagland et al., 2011).   21 \nCurrently in the UK, local authorities and treatment operators carry out time-22 \nconsuming and expensive studies to gain information on the percentages of material not 23 \nrecycled in the residual waste (Resource Future, 2008).  There is an increasingly high 1 \ncost and time premium to undertake the waste analysis, yet the need for constant 2 \nmonitoring of the waste stream to support and monitor the implementation of the strategy 3 \nis obligatory (Burnley et al., 2007).  The common approach of direct waste sampling 4 \ninvolves hand sorting waste into individual components (Burnley, 2007a; Burnley et al., 5 \n2007; Entec UK Ltd and Eunomia Research and Consulting Ltd, 2004; Friends of the 6 \nEarth, 2008); this is time consuming and carries a number of issues regarding labour costs 7 \nand health and safety concerns.  8 \nResearch towards new, non-invasive, remote imaging and image recognition 9 \nmethods to provide faster and more sensitive technologies for waste characterization 10 \ncould lead to significant savings in time and cost, and a reduction in the risk of worker 11 \nexposure.  The main principle of image analysis is that all objects have a series of visual 12 \ncharacteristics that allow differentiation, these can be: shape, size, pattern, tone, 13 \nassociation, shadow and texture (Paine and Kiser, 2003).  An example of a non-complex, 14 \nsimple approach that could be used to quantify the area coverage of items in a waste 15 \npicture is the dot grid method, which can be considered a rapid, repeatable, and precise 16 \nmethod (Nowak et al., 1996). A dot-grid consists of a set of dots superimposed on digital 17 \nimagery. The sum of dots intersecting the object of interest divided by the total amount of 18 \ndots computes an estimation of the area occupied by the object.  The use of a dot-grid in 19 \ncalculating the area occupied by object in an image has already been widely used in a 20 \nnumber of different applications including tree area coverage (Nowak et al., 1996), 21 \nmarine organism populations (Foster et al., 1991),  seed production (Gray et al., 2009) 22 \nand to calculate area of deformation on a surface (Blomberg and Persson, 2004).   23 \nThis study investigates the novel application of a dot-grid approach to assess the 1 \nphysical composition of a mixed residual waste material.  The aim of this method is to 2 \ndemonstrate a basic technique for determining the composition of large quantities of 3 \nwaste materials, without the disadvantages of lengthy site operation disruption and the 4 \nhealth and safety implications of hand sorting the equivalent waste sample.   5 \nThis investigation is part of a large project which aims to understand the arisings 6 \nand composition of commercial and industrial (C&I) wastes, due to a lack of 7 \nunderstanding of this waste stream in the UK.  Consequently in this study the dot-grid 8 \nand the conventional hand sorting methods have been used to determine the composition 9 \nof a number of samples from C&I waste collection rounds. 10 \n 11 \n2. Methods 12 \n2.1. Sample location and preparation 13 \nThree waste transfer stations were studied in this investigation, all of which 14 \nreceived mixed residual wastes collected by Shanks Waste Solutions from commercial 15 \nand industrial premises in the respective local areas.  Each of the transfer stations were 16 \nvisited twice during this study, providing a total of 6 sets of data.  Each of the sites 17 \nreceive between 30,000-60,000 tonnes of residual C&I waste per annum; the waste is 18 \neither sorted by manual sorting lines to extract recyclable components, or is sent onwards 19 \nfor landfill disposal. 20 \nFrom the input waste material 3 mechanical bucket loads (ca. 250 kg) were 21 \nisolated from the main waste pile and unloaded onto the sample area floor.  The refuse 22 \nbags were then manually split and the contents spread evenly across the designated 1 \nsample area to a depth of 20-30 cm.   2 \n 3 \n2.2. Imaging of waste sample 4 \n A total of 30 unique sections of the evenly spread waste sample were segregated  5 \nusing a 1 m\n2\n quadrat as shown in Fig. 1, with each section captured from directly above 6 \nusing a standard 12 megapixel digital camera.  The images, representing 900 m\n2\n or 7 \napproximately 270 m\n3\n, were then transferred onto a PC off-site for analysis with 8 \nspecialist software (Erdas Imagine v9.3). 9 \n 10 \n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Please insert Figure 1.<<<<<<<<<<<<<< 11 \n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Please insert Figure 2.<<<<<<<<<<<<<< 12 \n 13 \n The images were processed by sub-setting\/cropping the quadrat area, 14 \ngeometrically correcting to produce a square of equal, and defined, dimensions.  A dot-15 \ngrid (11 x 11) was then placed over the images (Fig. 2), and the number of dots covering 16 \neach waste component was counted digitally.   17 \n 18 \n2.3. Hand sorting 19 \n From the evenly spread sample material 15 sub-samples were taken, after 20 \nimaging, to ensure a representative sample (European Committee for Standardisation, 21 \n2005) for hand sorting.  The waste was sorted into categories including paper, card, dense 22 \nplastics, film plastics, metals, wood etc.  Each of the categories were then weighed and 1 \nrecorded, and the results reported as a percentage of the total mass. 2 \nThe individual components of a fixed volume (30 litres) were weighed to 3 \ndetermine the density (g\/cm\n3\n) of each component, where suitable literature values were 4 \nnot available, which was used to assist in the image analysis process.   5 \n 6 \n3. Results and discussion 7 \n The compositional results of the physical and image sorting are shown in Table 1. 8 \n 9 \n>>>>>>>>>>>>Please insert Table 1.<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< 10 \n  11 \n As shown in Table 1 the composition shown by physical sorting and from image 12 \nanalysis are different.  Conversely there is strong evidence that two sets of data are not 13 \nequal (p < 0.01, two tailed t-test).  However, despite this, there is a strong correlation 14 \nbetween the two datasets with correlation (r), with the lowest correlation being 0.55.  The 15 \nsignificance of these correlations are p<0.005; and p<0.05 for the weakest correlation (r = 16 \n0.55).   17 \n The physical composition of the wastes analysed indicate, on average, a higher 18 \nquantity of plastics than in previous studies (Burnley et al., 2007; SLR Consulting, 2007).  19 \nIn the UK the proportion of plastics, paper and card in mixed residual C&I wastes are 20 \ngenerally higher than in municipal solid waste (MSW).  This is largely due to recycling 21 \ntargets applied to MSW, but not to C&I (Defra, 2007).  The samples included within this 22 \nstudy appear to be typical of a mixed residual C&I waste from the UK.  There is very 23 \nlimited information regarding C&I waste in the UK, despite being significantly higher in 1 \nvolumes generated than MSW (Burnley, 2007a; Burnley et al., 2007; Jacobs Engineering 2 \nLtd, 2010).  3 \n The differences between the determined mass of waste components can be 4 \nattributed to the use of density values for each of the materials.  It is evident from the 5 \ntable that paper and light plastics (i.e. film packaging) are over-estimated by the image 6 \nanalysis method.  These are the lightweight fractions of waste, relative to other 7 \ncomponents and so the use of a density of each material is limited by the effect of sample 8 \noverlap and spreading.  For example 2-3 sheets of paper could cover a large, whereas 2-3 9 \ncompacted sheets of paper will cover a relatively small area; as a result the image 10 \nanalysis technique evidently over-estimates the paper content due to this limitation.  As a 11 \nresult of these observations it is necessary to investigate alternative methods of relating a 12 \n2 dimensional image to a mass unit for a specific component.  Previous studies have 13 \ninvestigated methods of calculating mass from a 2D image such as Banta et al (2003).   14 \nHowever this study focused  (Banta et al., 2003) on the characterisation of limestone 15 \nparticles; mixed waste materials are much more heterogeneous.   16 \n The results have highlighted that this technique could potentially be used in large-17 \nscale waste composition studies, such as those frequently undertaken by Local 18 \nAuthorities in the UK (Burnley, 2007a; Parfitt, 2002; Resource Futures, 2009).  Such 19 \ntechnique would mean that the time involved in processing the waste would be 20 \nsignificantly reduced; the images could be processed offsite, thus providing a digital 21 \nrecord of the samples collected.  Work is currently ongoing to enhance the accuracy of 22 \nthe technique, specifically with regards to the density conversion for each of the 23 \nmaterials; determining the maximum waste layer depth and improving the timescale 1 \ninvolved with processing the images.  Further work aims to automate the technique as far 2 \nas practically possible, resulting in a powerful tool for assessing waste composition and 3 \naiding decisions regarding adaptation of waste treatment processes to allow for changes 4 \nin waste composition. 5 \n  6 \n4. Conclusions  7 \n This paper has presented early findings of ongoing research.  The image analysis 8 \ntechnique has shown early potential that it could be a suitable methodology for assessing 9 \nthe composition of mixed waste materials, however further work is required to reduce 10 \nlimitations of the method.  Research is currently ongoing at Cranfield University to 11 \nimprove the accuracy of the process and to investigate other potential applications within 12 \nthe waste industry.   13 \n 14 \nReferences  15 \nBanta, L., Cheng, K., Zaniewski, J., 2003.
