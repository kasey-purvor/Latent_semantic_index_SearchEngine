Introduction\n[2] The Himalayan orogen provides a type example of\ncontinent-continent collision on which a number of models\nof deformation of the continental lithosphere are based.\nTectonic reconstructions are critical to the development of\nsuch models. While timing of exhumation of the Higher\nHimalayan lithotectonic unit is relatively well documented\nin India [Thiede et al., 2009; Vannay et al., 2004, and\nreferences therein] the timing and mechanism by which\ndeformation subsequently propagated south within the\nthrust belt, to the Lesser Himalayan lithotectonic unit, is\nconsiderably less well defined.\n[3] This paper examines a sedimentary succession within\nthe Himalayan foreland basin near Jawalamukhi in NW\nIndia (Figure 1), dated from 12 to 5 Ma [Brozovic and\nBurbank, 2000; Meigs et al., 1995]. Combined with the\nneighboring sedimentary succession dated from 21 to 13 Ma\n[White et al., 2002] (labeled CMB in Figure 1) this provides\nthe longest record of erosion from the mountain belt\npreserved in the basin in India. Within this record lies\ninformation on the transition of exhumation from the Higher\nto Lesser Himalaya. Such data will inform theoretical\nmodels of crustal deformation by allowing more refined\nmodel data comparisons [Jamieson et al., 2004]. In addi-\ntion, an accurate knowledge of the timing of the exhumation\nof the Lesser Himalaya is required in order to test hypoth-\neses that relate erosion of this unit to changes in ocean\ngeochemistry [Bickle et al., 2001; English et al., 2000; Galy\net al., 1999; Pierson-Wickmann et al., 2000; Quade et al.,\n1997; Quade et al., 2003].\n2. Sedimentary Succession\n[4] The 12\u20135 Ma magnetostratigraphically dated Siwalik\nGroup studied here is located in the Kangra reentrant\n(Figure 1), in the same region as the previously published\nstudy of the 21\u201313 Ma Dharamsala Formation [White et al.,\n2001]. Both sections are of alluvial facies. The Siwalik\nsection, termed the Jawalamukhi section after a nearby town,\nis 3400 m thick (Figure 2). As described by Meigs et al.\n[1995] and Brozovic and Burbank [2000], the lower part\nof the section, from 0 to 470 m, consists of relatively thin\n(2\u20135 m in general) sandstone bodies interbedded with silt-\nstones and soil horizons. Between 470 and 1620 m, the suc-\ncession is dominated by thicker multistoried sandstone bodies\n(20\u201330m thickness in general) with thin conglomeratic beds.\nTECTONICS, VOL. 28, TC5018, doi:10.1029\/2009TC002506, 2009\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1Lancaster Environment Centre, Lancaster University, Lancaster, UK.\n2Department of Earth Sciences, Cambridge University, Cambridge, UK.\n3Dipartimento di Scienze Geologiche e Geotecnologie, Universita` degli\nStudi di Milano-Bicocca, Milan, Italy.\n4SUERC, East Kilbride, UK.\n5Department of Agricultural and Consumer Economics, University of\nIllinois, Urbana, USA.\n6Department of Geological Sciences, University of California, Santa\nBarbara, California, USA.\nCopyright 2009 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0278-7407\/09\/2009TC002506$12.00\nTC5018 1 of 15\nFrom 1620 m to the top of the succession, the lithology is\ndominated by clast-supported conglomerate. Rare sandstones\nand siltstones persist, becoming prevalent again in the finer-\ngrained interval between 2100 and 2400 m.\n[5] The studied section lies close to the Beas River, a\nmajor transverse river which today drains a hinterland\nwhich includes the Lesser Himalaya, Rampur Window (also\ncalled the Larji-Kullu-Rampur Window (LKRW) in previous\nstudies) and Higher Himalaya to the north (Figure 1). Palae-\nocurrent indicators from the Jawalamukhi Siwalik section\nare toward the SW but with variations of WSW, S and, in\nthe lowest part of the section, to the SSE [Brozovic and\nBurbank, 2000] showing that the rivers which deposited the\nSiwalik strata drained a similar region to the present-day\nBeas River. These researchers interpreted the majority of\nthe Jawalamukhi sedimentary section as the deposits of a\ntransverse river, but the basal section (>9 Ma) as deposited\nby an axial river. However, our new provenance data suggest\nthat the entire Siwalik sedimentary section at Jawalamukhi\nwas deposited by a transverse river system: By the time of\ndeposition of the basal Siwalik succession, the Higher\nHimalaya had exhumed rapidly and thus likely dominated\nthe sedimentary signal of any major axial river at the time,\nas it does today (for example, Ganges River petrography\nplotted on Figure 3). This is unlike the sedimentary signal\nseen in the Jawalamukhi section in which Higher Himalayan\ncontribution is subordinate, as detailed in this study.\n3. Regional Geology of the Hinterland\n3.1. Lithotectonic Units\n[6] The Himalaya formed when India and Asia collided\nat ca 55\u201350 Ma [de Sigoyer et al., 2000; Garzanti et al.,\nFigure 1.

Note the position of the Beas River which suggests the direction of the source region.\nPalaeocurrent data from the Siwalik section indicates that a river system with similar flow direction was\nin evidence in the past [Brozovic and Burbank, 2000].

South of the suture zone, the\nIndian crust consists of a number of lithotectonic units,\nseparated by south verging thrusts and a north dipping\nnormal fault (Figure 1). From north to south, the main\nlithotectonic units are the Tethyan Himalaya, the Higher\nHimalaya, the Lesser Himalaya and the Sub-Himalaya.\n[7] The Tethyan Himalaya consists of Paleozoic-Eocene\naged marine sedimentary rocks that were deposited on the\nnorthern passive margin of the Indian continent [Gaetani\nand Garzanti, 1991]. The Tethyan Himalaya is separated\nfrom the Higher Himalaya to the south by the South Tibetan\nDetachment Zone (STDZ). The Higher Himalaya, termed\nthe Higher Himalayan Crystalline Series (HHC), consists of\npredominantly medium to high-grade rocks metamorphosed\nin the Cenozoic during the Himalayan orogeny. The unit is\noverthrust upon the Lesser Himalayan sequence along the\nMain Central Thrust (MCT).\n[8] The Lesser Himalaya in India has been subdivided into\nthe Inner Lesser Himalaya (ILH) and Outer Lesser Himalaya\n(OLH) on the basis of their differing eNd signatures [Ahmad\net al., 2000; Richards et al., 2005]. The rocks consist\npredominantly of Precambrian-Paleozoic rocks of varying\nmetamorphic grade. The Outer Lesser Himalaya, which shares\na similar eNd signature to the Higher Himalaya (Table 1), is\ntypically of low metamorphic grade, and does not crop out\nin the region of study. The Inner Lesser Himalaya, which\nhas more negative eNd values than the Higher Himalaya, can\nbe divided into a unit consisting of sedimentary, low grade\nmetamorphic and mafic volcanic rocks, and a unit of\nmedium-high-grade metamorphic rocks termed the Lesser\nHimalayan Crystallines Series (LHCS). In the region of\nstudy, the LHCS is exposed in the Rampur window, separated\nfrom the nonmetamorphosed Inner Lesser Himalaya by the\nMunsiari Thrust (MT). The nonmetamorphosed Inner Lesser\nHimalaya is also exposed as a narrow strip forming the\nhanging wall to the Main Boundary Thrust (MBT) to\nthe south. Between this and the Rampur window lies the\nHaimanta Formation, preserved in a klippe as shown in\nFigure 1. The Haimanta Formation are considered to be\nnonmetamorphosed cover to the Higher Himalaya and\/or\nbase of the Tethyan Himalaya [Chambers et al., 2009].\n[9] The Sub-Himalaya consists of Cenozoic marine and\ncontinental sedimentary rocks, eroded from the Himalaya\nand deposited in the foreland basin to the south of the\norogen [Burbank et al., 1996], and is the unit in which the\nsedimentary succession of this study is located. It is sepa-\nrated from the Lesser Himalaya above by the Main Boundary\nThrust and from the present-day foreland basin and Indian\ncraton to the south by the Himalayan Frontal Thrust.\n[10] Characteristics of the units of relevance to this prov-\nenance study are given in Table 1. The units to the NE of the\nJawalamukhi section are the probable source terrain, given\nthe modern day drainage pattern and palaeocurrent indica-\ntors (after postdepositional thrusting has been taken into\naccount [Brozovic and Burbank, 2000]). Figure 1 shows this\nregion, the rocks divided broadly into the Higher Himalaya,\nInner Lesser Himalaya (nonmetamorphosed and metamor-\nphosed (LHCS) units) and Haimanta Formation, on the basis\nof lithology, metamorphic grade and isotopic signature.\n3.2. Tectonic Evolution of the Units in NW India,\nas Determined From Published Bedrock Data\n[11] Following Oligocene tectonic burial [e.g., Vance and\nHarris, 1999] and metamorphic peak at \u000223 Ma, rapid\nexhumation of the Higher Himalaya occurred until \u000219\u2013\n16 Ma [Thiede et al., 2009; Vannay et al., 2004]. Exhuma-\ntion of the Higher Himalaya is thought to have been\nachieved by extrusion between the MCT below and the\nSangla Detachment (part of the STDS) above. Decreased\nexhumation, interpreted as the result of cessation of move-\nment along the MCT, persisted until \u00023 Ma, when rapid\nexhumation resumed [Thiede et al., 2009].\n[12] Prograde metamorphism in the Lesser Himalayan\nCrystalline series of the Rampur Window, due to burial\nbeneath the High Himalaya, was terminated at \u000211 Ma by\ntectonic exhumation along the Munsiari\/Jutogh Thrust\n[Caddick et al., 2007; Thiede et al., 2009; Vannay et al.,\n2004]. Rapid exhumation of the LHCS continued to present-\nFigure 2. Sedimentary section of the Jawalamukhi Siwalik\nsection, with magnetostratigraphy [Meigs et al., 1995] and\nsample locations marked on.

It has been proposed that the LHCS\noriginally formed the basement to the nonmetamorphosed\nLesser Himalayan \u2018\u2018cover\u2019\u2019 rocks beneath the Munsiari\nThrust (Rampur and Shali Formations), and was thrust\nover them in the last few million years [Miller et al.,\n2000]. Development of the Rampur window may have been\nassociated with the development of ramps along the MBT at\nthe time [Stephenson et al., 2001], which was thought to\nhave been active by 10\u20135 Ma [DeCelles et al., 1998; Meigs\net al., 1995].\n[13] Thus, in summary, the bedrock mineral ages imply\nthat rapid exhumation of the Higher Himalaya between the\nSTDS and MCT slowed down considerably at ca 19\u201316 Ma\nwhen the locus of thrusting transferred south to the Lesser\nHimalaya. Available bedrock data for the region put peak\nmetamorphism of the LHCS sometime between 11 and\n6 Ma according to Vannay et al. [2004], with Caddick et al.\n[2007] asserting that exhumation of the Lesser Himalayan\nCrystalline Series began by 11 Ma. This pulse of rapid\nexhumation of the LHCS continued until \u00023 Ma, after\nFigure 3. Petrography and heavy mineral data. Compositional trends in the Siwalik Jawalamukhi\nsection. Quartzo-lithic to litho-quartzose sandstones of the basal to lower intervals are replaced at \u000311 Ma\nby lithic-rich sandstones of the central interval, including abundant dolostone grains after \u000310.5 Ma.\nLithic-dominated sandstones of the upper interval chiefly consist of sedimentary to very low grade\nmetasedimentary detritus, but also include significant basalt after \u00037 Ma. An abrupt increase in K-\nfeldspar is recorded at \u00036 Ma, when garnet-dominated assemblages including staurolite, kyanite, and\nlocally sillimanite are replaced by epidotes and ultrastables.

Petrographic and Isotopic Analyses on the\nSiwalik Jawalamukhi Section Detrital Material\n4.1. Lithologies of the Eroded Detritus\n4.1.1. Sandstone Petrography and Heavy Mineral\nAnalyses\n[14] The sandstone petrography and heavy mineral anal-\nyses are shown in Figures 3 and 4 and Table S1. Three\nhundred grains from each of 18 thin sections from the\nSiwalik Group of the Jawalamukhi section were point\ncounted using the Gazzi-Dickinson method [Ingersoll et\nal., 1984; Zuffa, 1985], and 200 to 250 transparent dense\nminerals were counted from each of 16 samples by the\n\u2018\u2018ribbon-counting\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018Flett\u2019\u2019 methods [Mange and Maurer,\n1992] (results summarized in Tables S1a and S1b).1\n[15] The rocks are quartzo-lithic to lithic sandstones,\nderived predominantly from sedimentary and very low\ngrade metasedimentary sources, as evidenced by the grade\nof the lithic fragments. Detrital quartz is prevalent at the\nbase of the section, decreasing markedly upsection, indic-\native of recycling from older sedimentary rocks. Sedimen-\ntary lithic fragments include sandstones, argillites, chert and\ncarbonate, the latter showing a dominance of dolomite since\n10.6 Ma. Volcanic lithic fragments are negligible in the\nlower part of the succession. Mafic volcanic and granitoid\/\northogneiss rock fragments and conglomerate clasts appear\nabove the start of the conglomeratic facies at 9 Ma. This is a\nharbinger for the major increase in basalt and granitoid lithic\nfragments (also seen in the clast count proportions), dolo-\nstone and quartzite seen at 6 Ma. Coeval with this event at\n6 Ma, the subordinate higher grade metamorphic contribution\nwas entirely cut out, as illustrated by the drastic reduction in\ngarnet. Prior to 6 Ma, higher grade metamorphic material\ncontributed to the detritus in minor quantities. Progressive\nexhumation of higher grade metamorphic rock is documented\nby increasing abundance of higher grade metamorphic miner-\nals upsection: garnet, staurolite, and rare kyanite are present\nfrom the base of the section, with kyanite becoming more\ncommon and sillimanite first appearing at ca. 9 Ma.\n4.1.2. Conglomerates\n[16] The thick conglomeratic facies extends from 9 Ma to\ntop of the section (5 Ma) in the sedimentary record at\nJawalamukhi, with thin conglomeratic beds interbedded\nwith sandstones, down to 11 Ma. 100 conglomerate clasts,\n>1 cm in diameter, were taken from each of 10 stations,\nspanning both the thin conglomerate units >9 Ma, and the\nextensive conglomerates <9 Ma. In Figure 5 the clasts are\nassigned to one of five categories: granitoid-gneiss, mafic\nigneous, quartzite, clastic sedimentary clasts excluding\nquartzite, and carbonate. Distinguishing between a mafic\nigneous composition and a sandstone proved difficult for\na very fine grained, very dark gray clast type. These\nclasts have been assigned to the nonquartzite clastic\nsedimentary category in Figure 5. Only those clasts clearly\nidentifiable as mafic igneous by the presence of acicular\ncrystals, phenocrysts, or other clearly identifiable igneous\ntextures, are assigned to the mafic igneous category in\nFigure 5.\n[17] Most clasts were subrounded to well-rounded. A\nnumber of clasts >10 cm diameter occur (largest, 21 cm),\nwith modes (excluding clasts < 1 cm diameter) consistently\nbetween 3 and 5 cm diameter. Trends in proportions of the\nvarious lithological categories are seen: Granitoid-gneiss is\nrare before 9 Ma, showing a significant increase thereafter.\nMafic igneous clasts are rare, becoming more common after\n6 Ma. Purple quartzite (not shown as a separate category in\nFigure 5) is present from the base of the conglomeratic unit\nbut shows a major increase after 6 Ma. The nonquartzite\nclastic sedimentary clasts show a variety of lithologies,\nincluding sandstones and siltstones of varying color, grain\nsize and hardness. A good variety of all such sedimentary\nclasts types are represented at all stations, except above\n6 Ma, represented by Station JW03\u201315 where only a few\npurple sandstones are present, and Station JW03\u20137 where\nthe only sedimentary clasts recorded consist of the very dark\ngray, very fine grained sedimentary\/igneous rock of indis-\ntinct provenance, as described above.\n4.2. Sr-Nd Analyses of Bulk Rock and Conglomerate\nClasts\n[18] Five conglomerate matrix samples, two of which\nwere subdivided into fine and coarse fractions, and eight\nmudstones\/siltstone samples were analyzed for Sm-Nd and\nRb-Sr isotopic compositions. In addition, 12 clasts of\nvarying lithologies, taken from conglomerate beds located\nabove 1620 m (9 Ma) in the section, and 10 small pebbles\nwhich occur infrequently in the sandstones between 750 and\n393 m (10.6\u201311.3 Ma), were analyzed for Sm-Nd isotopic\ncompositions. No pebbles were found in the basal part of\nthe section. Dissolution and analytical methods for Sr and\nSm-Nd isotopic analyses are as in the work by White et al.\n[2002] except that Rb and Sr concentrations were measured\nby isotope dilution on a Nu MC-ICPMS with Sr isotopic\nfractionations corrected and normalized during the analysis\nto 86Sr\/88Sr = 0.1194 and Rb isotopic composition normal-\nized by sample standard bracketing assuming a power law\nfractionation factor. The Rb\/Sr ratios are accurate to better\nthan \u00b11%. Nd blanks were less than 250 pg and Sm blanks\nless than 120 pg. Analyses of the Cambridge JM Nd\nstandard gave 143Nd\/144Nd = 0.511121 \u00b1 18 (2s) and\nanalyses of the NBS987 standard gave 0.710250 \u00b1 18 (2s)\nduring the period of the analyses.\n[19] The results are summarized in Table S2 and Figure 6.\nBulk rock eNd(0) values for both conglomerate matrix and\nsiltstone remain constant from the base of the section until\n6 Ma, with an average value of \u000415, marginally more\nnegative for the conglomerate matrix. After 6 Ma, values\nbecome distinctly more negative, at \u000418 to \u000419 for\nsiltstone and \u000423 for conglomerate matrix. eNd(0) values\nfor conglomerate clasts show no clearly defined temporal\ntrend. Clasts with distinctly negative eNd(0) values (\u0002\u000425)\noccur from 9 Ma onwards.\n1Auxiliary material data sets are available at ftp:\/\/ftp.agu.org\/apend\/tc\/\n2009tc002506.

Ar-Ar Analyses of Detrital White Micas\n[20] Between 20 and 35 grains from each of 15 Siwalik\nsamples from the Jawalamukhi section were analyzed by\ntotal fusion, following the method as described by Najman\net al. [2003]. In addition, a further Siwalik sample\n(JK99\u201301), magnetostratigraphically dated at 5\u20136 Ma,\nfrom Haripur, outside the Kangra reentrant [Sangode et al.,\n1996] was analyzed. Modern river sands were collected\nfrom the Beas River, a major transverse river which drains\nthe Higher Himalaya. A sample was collected where the\nriver enters the Sub-Himalaya at Mandi, and to the north at\nKullu, upstream of the Rampur Window. Results are shown\nin Figures 7 and 8, and tabulated in Table S3.\n[21] From the base of the Jawalamukhi section until\n7.7 Ma, Cenozoic aged micas dominate the mica population\nin most samples, with subordinate populations stretching\nto the Cambrian. The youngest grain in each sample lies\nbetween 15 and 18 Ma and the youngest modes between 16\nFigure 5. Conglomerate clast counts (100 clasts counted, of diameter >1 cm, at each station). The\ncategory \u2018\u2018mafic igneous\u2019\u2019 only includes those clasts clearly identifiable as such in the field, by the\nappearance of distinctive igneous texture. The origin of one clast type (igneous or sedimentary), a very\nfine grained, dark gray rock, was difficult to determine in the field and was assigned to the \u2018\u2018sedimentary\u2019\u2019\ncategory. The \u2018\u2018unidentified\u2019\u2019 category contained unrecognizable clasts, mainly due to heavy weathering\nor alteration.\nFigure 4.

(c and d) Greatest abundance in higher-\nrank metamorphic rock fragments and detrital feldspars indicate increasing detritus from medium-high-grade rocks between\n10 and 11 and 9\u201310 Ma.

Between 7 to 6 Ma, Cenozoic grains are almost\nentirely absent, with the mica population dominated by\nPaleozoic and Mesozoic grains. At 6 Ma another change\noccurs, and the Palaeozoic-Mesozoic grains become subor-\ndinate to Proterozoic gains. The continuing prevalence of\nCenozoic mica populations in sample JK99\u201301 located\noutside the reentrant in Haripur, and dated between 5 and\n6 Ma, indicates that these changes are local, not basin wide.\n[22] Lag times (the difference between the mica Ar-Ar\nage and the host sediment depositional age, an indicator of\nexhumation rate of the source region [Bernet et al., 2001])\nrange between 4.1 and 10.4 Myr as calculated for youngest\ngrains, and 5.8\u201311.3 Myr as calculated for modes (Figure 9).\nSeven samples, which lacked Cenozoic populations (no\nCenozoic aged grains or one grain only), are excluded from\nthe plot. In some instances our data set shows considerable\nvariation in youngest grains and modes for coeval samples,\npossibly the result of the relatively small number of grains\nanalyzed per sample [e.g., see Amidon et al., 2005]. Com-\nbining data from samples of near coeval age to improve the\nanalysis number was therefore also undertaken to better\nunderstand the consequences of small sample size on our\ninterpretations: data from three samples ranging in deposi-\ntional age from 10.8 to 12.2 Ma were amalgamated, as were\ndata from four samples aged between 7.7 and 8.8 Ma.\nComparison with data from single samples of similar age\nshow that the mode is lowered by 2\u20134 Myr, bringing it\ncloser to the youngest grain age. When combined with data\nFigure 6. (a) The eNd whole rock data for conglomerate clasts and (b) bulk rock conglomerate matrix\nand siltstone.

After 17 Ma the lag times are\nbroadly consistent with \u2018steady state exhumation\u2019 at rates\nbetween 1 and 2 mm\/a (calculated as by White et al.\n[2002]).\n5. Interpretations\n5.1. Provenance of the Jawalamukhi Siwalik\nSedimentary Rocks\n[23] Mafic igneous detritus (occurring as both lithic frag-\nments in sandstones, and as conglomerate clasts) is most\nlikely derived from the nonmetamorphosed Lesser Himalaya,\ne.g., the Rampur volcanics of the Rampur Window or\nMandi-Darla volcanics in the hanging wall of the MBT.\nPotential sources for the granitoid-gneiss detritus could be\nthe Higher Himalaya, Haimanta or Lesser Himalaya\n(LHCS). Potential sources for the sedimentary lithic detritus\ninclude the Haimanta Formation, Lesser Himalaya, or\nrecycled earlier foreland basin deposits. The Sm-Nd data\nfrom the conglomerate clasts (Figure 5) permits provenance\ndiscrimination between these alternative potential sources,\nas described below.\n[24] The bulk rock eNd values indicate that the bulk of the\nfine-grained sediment was derived predominantly from\nHigher Himalaya or Haimanta until 6 Ma (Table 1). How-\never, analyses of clasts show that a proportion of the\nsediment was derived from the Inner Lesser Himalaya from\nat least 9 Ma. Clasts identified as Inner Lesser Himalayan\non the basis of their eNd values include quartzites and a\nfoliated granitoid (clast JW97\u201319B CT1, depositional age\n5.2 Ma) that has an eNd (1800) value similar to that of\nProterozoic granitoids in the Rampur Window [Miller et al.,\n2000]. Nonquartzite sedimentary clasts have eNd values\nconsistent with derivation from the Haimanta Formation\nand some quartzite clasts also have Haimanta signature.\nGranitoid clast sample JW97\u201336B CT1, (depositional age\n7.3 Ma) has an eNd(500) value similar to the Palaeozoic\ngranites (e.g., the Mandi granite [Miller et al., 2001]) which\nintrude these Haimanta rocks.\n[25] The white micas with Cenozoic Ar-Ar ages, which\nare dominant in sandstone samples aged >7.7 Ma, were in\nall probability derived from the Higher Himalaya. Both their\nmodes and youngest grain ages compare well with ages of\nFigure 7. Probability density plots of Ar-Ar ages of white\nmica grains for modern river sands (2273 Beas River at\nKullu; 2267 Beas River at Mandi), Siwalik sandstone from\nHaripur section outside the Kangra reentrant (JK99-01A\nand JK99-01B), and Siwalik samples from the Jawalamukhi\nsection (JW).

Lag time trends\nwhich lie parallel to a dashed line indicate a period of steady state exhumation. Trends which cross lines\nindicate departure from stead state, to either increasing exhumation rates (decreasing lag times up section)\nor decreasing exhumation rates (increasing lag times up section). Line with diamonds indicates lag times\ncalculated using youngest grain, and line with squares indicates lag times calculated using youngest mode.\nTC5018 NAJMAN ET AL.: EXHUMATION OF THE LESSER HIMALAYA\n11 of 15\nTC5018\nmicas from Higher Himalayan bedrock and from detrital\ngrains from the Beas River (Table 1). The Lower Palaeozoic\ngrains which are also present in these samples, and domi-\nnant in the samples dated between 6 and 7 Ma are likely\nderived from the Cambro-Ordovician granites intruding\nHaimanta\/Higher Himalayan lithologies. The Proterozoic\ngrains, which dominate the mica populations in samples\n<6 Ma, are likely derived from Proterozoic granitoids such\nas the Wangu gneiss, which intrude the Lesser Himalayan\nCrystalline Series.\n5.2. Tectonic History of the Hinterland, as Determined\nFrom the Siwalik Detrital Record\n[26] In the Siwalik rocks of the Jawalamukhi section, the\ndearth of mica Ar-Ar ages younger than 16 Ma suggests\nthat, in this region, rapid exhumation of the Higher Himalaya\nhad ceased by this time. This lack of mineral ages younger\nthan 16 Ma is in agreement with mica ages determined from\nbedrock studies of the area [Thiede et al., 2005; Vannay et\nal., 2004] and our new ages of detrital micas taken from\nmodern river sands draining the Higher Himalaya in this\nregion (samples 22267 Mandi and 2273 Kullu). Slow down\nof exhumation before 16 Ma is consistent with the cooling\ncurve constructed for the Higher Himalaya of the region\n[Thiede et al., 2009; Vannay et al., 2004] and with an\nincrease in lag time between sediment depositional age and\nAr-Ar ages of Higher Himalayan sourced detrital white\nmicas at 17 Ma, as determined from the Dharamsala\nFormation section [White et al., 2002] (Figures 8 and 9).\n[27] This time of slowdown of exhumation of the\nHigher Himalaya is proposed to represent the period when\nthrusting propagated southwards into the footwall of the\nMCT [Caddick et al., 2007; Chambers et al., 2009; Vannay\net al., 2004], with the Higher Himalaya continuing to\nexhume more slowly after this time, burying the Lesser\nHimalayan Crystalline Series metamorphosed at \u000211 Ma.\nThis protracted slower exhumation of the Higher Himalaya\nis verified by the detrital record. Broadly, lag times remain\nconstant up section, 6\u20137 Myr (calculated from youngest\ngrain) over the time interval 16 to 7 Ma, thus describing a\nmoving peak defining (on a coarse temporal scale) steady\nstate exhumation of the Higher Himalaya over this time\nperiod, but at a slower rate than prior to 17 Ma. The abrupt\nincrease in lag time at 17 Ma is accompanied by a switch in\nprovenance from predominantly metamorphic detritus of\nHigher Himalayan source, to predominantly sedimentary\/\nvery low grade metamorphic detritus, interpreted as eroded\nfrom the Haimanta Formation [White et al., 2002] lying to\nthe south of the Higher Himalaya and indicative of south-\nward propagation of thrusting. The excursion to higher\nexhumation rates between 12 and 11 Ma and possibly to\n8 Ma is consistent with the higher exhumation rate (2 to\n3 mm\/yr) of the relatively thin crustal segment between the\nMCT and Munsiari Thrust inferred by Caddick et al. [2007]\nfrom the P-T-t evolution of one LHCS sample.\n[28] Initial input of Inner Lesser Himalayan material into\nthe detrital record, when the Rampur Window breached its\nHaimanta cover, is difficult to detect using the techniques\nwe employed. This is because the low grade metamorphic\nand sedimentary lithic fragments may be sourced either\nfrom the Lesser Himalaya or the Haimanta Formation, many\nLesser Himalayan lithologies are mica-poor, and the more\nnegative Lesser Himalayan eNd signal is swamped in bulk\nrock analyses by dilution with Haimanta\/Higher Himalayan\ndetritus which continued to contribute significant amounts\nof detritus to the basin, as evidenced by the prevalence of\nCenozoic micas and bulk rock eNd values with Haimanta\/\nHigher Himalayan signature.\n[29] Sm-Nd analysis on pebbles, which are present in the\nsedimentary record from 11 Ma onward, overcomes the\nproblem of signal swamping by Haimanta\/Higher Himalayan\ndilution in bulk rock analyses. In the lower part of the\nsuccession, below the onset of thick conglomerate beds at\n1680 m (8.8 Ma) all of the pebbles analyzed have eNd values\ntypical of Haimanta\/Higher Himalaya affinity, with their\nsedimentary lithologies confirming Haimanta rather than\nHigher Himalayan provenance. The first Inner Lesser\nHimalayan clast (of sedimentary lithology) was detected at\n1680 m within the succession (8.8 Ma). The nonmetamor-\nphosed Inner Lesser Himalaya was thus exhumed to surface\nby this time, consistent with bedrock data [Caddick et al.,\n2007; Vannay et al., 2004]. However, initial erosion of\nthis unit may have occurred earlier but its detritus may lie\nundetected in the sedimentary record: Clasts in the older\npart of the succession, to 11.3 Ma, are very rare, and\nsampling may have missed a Lesser Himalayan derived\npebble. Prior to 11.3 Ma no clasts were found and a small\nLesser Himalayan input would go undetected in the sand-\nstone andmudstone fractions, using the techniques described.\nPossible evidence for initiation of Lesser Himalayan erosion\nby 10.6 Ma may be the dominance of dolomite over\nlimestone, typical of the Lesser Himalaya, as lithic frag-\nments in sandstones, at this time. From 9 Ma, the conglom-\neratic facies, with clasts of mixed Haimanta and Lesser\nHimalayan lithologies attest to the prevalence of a proximal\nsource. Lesser Himalayan clasts are of sedimentary origin,\nindicating that it is nonmetamorphosed Inner Lesser Hima-\nlayan \u2018\u2018cover\u2019\u2019 rather than the metamorphosed Inner Lesser\nHimalaya (LHCS) that was being exhumed during that time,\nconsistent with the common occurrence of mafic volcanic\nlithic fragments recorded.\n[30] Beginning at 7 Ma, Higher Himalayan material is cut\nout in the Jawalamukhi section and detritus was entirely\nderived from more proximal sources in the Lesser Himalaya.\nWe interpret this drastic change as the result of trunk (Higher\nHimalaya draining) river diversion away from the section of\nstudy due to thrust tectonics as the metamorphosed Inner\nLesser Himalaya (LHCS) breached surface: Between 7 and\n6 Ma, Higher Himalayan Cenozoic aged white micas are cut\nout; Sm-Nd bulk rock values; dominance of Palaeozoic\nwhite micas likely derived from Cambro-Ordovician gran-\nites; and the presence of a granitoid clast of such an affinity\n(JW97\u201336B CT1 and CT2, depositional age 7.3 Ma) attest\nto continued substantial input from the Haimanta. At 6 Ma,\ngarnet (presumably Higher Himalayan derived) is cut out\nand increased erosion from the nonmetamorphosed Inner\nLesser Himalayan \u2018\u2018cover\u2019\u2019 is signaled by the major influx\nof mafic volcanics and dolomite lithic fragments. Palaeozoic\nTC5018 NAJMAN ET AL.: EXHUMATION OF THE LESSER HIMALAYA\n12 of 15\nTC5018\nwhite micas are drastically reduced, replaced by a flood of\nProterozoic grains derived from Proterozoic granitoid\ngneisses intruding the Lesser Himalaya, such as the Wangu\ngneiss of the Lesser Himalayan crystallines series. A gran-\nitoid conglomerate clast of such affinity (JW97\u201319B CT1,\ndepositional age 5.2 Ma) confirms erosion of the LHCS by\nthis time, coincident with a major increase in granitoid lithic\nfragments as documented from sandstone petrography. Such\nmaterial heralds the earliest observed record of erosion of\nthe metamorphosed LHCS, such as that exposed in the\nRampur Window.\n[31] The sequential appearance and timing of the non-\nmetamorphosed Inner Lesser Himalayan cover and meta-\nmorphosed Inner Lesser Himalaya (LHCS) is consistent\nwith our tectonic reconstruction. Prior to exhumation of the\nILH metamorphic rocks, the part of the Inner Lesser\nHimalaya exhumed would have been that subducted beneath\nthe MCT only to shallow depths, probably a sedimentary\ncover to the deeper Jutogh schists and Wangtu gneisses,\nsuch as the Rampur quartzites. This is reflected in the earlier\noccurrence of quartzite conglomerate clasts with Inner\nLesser Himalayan eNd (500) signatures. Assuming Rampur\nquartzites of chlorite grade (closure temperature ca 300\u2013\n350\u0002C) exposed at 9 Ma, Jutogh and Wangtu LHCS cooling\nthrough 625\u0002C at \u00027 kbar at 11 Ma [Caddick et al., 2007],\nan exhumation rate of 3 mm\/yr [Thiede et al., 2009], it\nwould take 4 Myr for the additional 12 km of material to be\nexhumed subsequent to Rampur Formation exposure at\n9 Ma. This would place LHCS exposure at 5 Ma, consistent\nwith the first substantial appearance of its detritus observed\nthe sediment record at 5\u20136 Ma. Major exhumation of the\nLHCS is also reflected in markedly decreased contribution\nfrom the Haimanta \u2018\u2018cover\u2019\u2019 from this time.\n[32] After 6 Ma, erosion from the Inner Lesser Himalaya\nwas sufficient to dominate the sedimentary signal as shown\nby eNd bulk rock data now with Lesser Himalayan values\nand mica Ar-Ar ages showing that the Higher Himalayan\nand Haimanta material was entirely cut out. The spatially\nrestricted nature of this drastic provenance change (the\ncoeval sample from Haripur outside the reentrant continues\nto show Higher Himalayan input) is consistent with our\ninterpretation of a localized source region, the Rampur\nWindow, subjected to tectonic exhumation during that period.\n6. Summary and Further Implications\n[33] The exhumation rate of the Higher Himalaya de-\ncreased markedly shortly before 16 Ma, after which the\nHigher Himalaya continued to exhume to deeper metamor-\nphic levels but at much slower rates and thrusting trans-\nferred into the footwall of the MCT. The Lesser Himalaya\nlies in the footwall of the MCT, but first to be exhumed was\nits overlying Haimanta cover, which contributed a substantial\ninput to the sedimentary record from 17 Ma [White et al.,\n2002]. Nonmetamorphosed Lesser Himalaya was exhumed\nto surface by 9 Ma. Major exhumation of the Lesser\nHimalaya, including exhumation to surface of the Lesser\nHimalayan Crystalline Series, occurred at 6 Ma causing\nmajor disruption to river drainage patterns.\n[34] Our interpretations agree in part with those of\nprevious workers [Brozovic and Burbank, 2000; Meigs et\nal., 1995] who recognized Lesser Himalayan material in the\nconglomerates younger than 9 Ma. However, contrary to\nprevious work, we do not infer that these conglomerates\ndate movement along the Main Boundary Thrust. The MBT\nis the most southerly of thrusts exhuming the Lesser\nHimalaya, and more northerly thrusts, for example the\nMunsiari Thrust as exposed in the Rampur Window, likely\nexhumed Lesser Himalayan material earlier. Such tectonics\nhave already been proposed in Nepal, where DeCelles et al.\n[1998] document exhumation of the Lesser Himalayan\nduplex, prior to MBT motion.\n[35] Our data can also be compared with a recent numer-\nical model which explains a number of features of the\norogen, in particular exhumation of the Higher Himalaya,\nby extrusion of a low velocity lower midcrust by channel\nflow [Beaumont et al., 2001]. The timing of first appearance\nat surface of rocks of progressively increasing metamorphic\ngrade is predicted by the model [Jamieson et al., 2004], and\ncan be tested by documenting the timing of first appearance\nof specific metamorphic minerals in the erosional record,\nassuming rapid transport from source to sink. In the model,\ngreenschist facies (garnet present) is predicted to appear at\nsurface at ca 25 Ma, becoming the dominant material being\neroded by 20 Ma. At this time amphibolite material (stau-\nrolite and possibly kyanite) should first appear at surface,\ncontributing significantly to the detritus by ca 15 Ma. At\n15 Ma migmatite, perhaps containing kyanite and\/or silli-\nmanite, is predicted to first appear at surface, contributing\nsignificantly to material being eroded by 10 Ma. Our data\nfrom the Indian foreland basin, encompassing new data\nfrom the Siwalik Group and previously published data from\nthe older Dharamsala, Dagshai and Kasauli Formation are\nconsistent with these model predictions. Subgreenschist\nfacies were being eroded into the basin in NW India during\ndeposition of the Dagshai Formation, with significant ero-\nsion of garnet-bearing lithologies around ca 20 Ma (in the\nKasauli and Lower Dharamsala Formations) [Najman and\nGarzanti, 2000; White et al., 2002]. Rare staurolite is\nsporadically present at 20 Ma [White et al., 2002], and\nkyanite at 13 Ma (this study). However, the appearance of\nsillimanite at 8 Ma is later than model predictions.\n[36] In order for our interpretations to be robust, we need\nto know the degree to which variations in the sediment\nrecord reflect changes in drainage rather than tectonics. In\nan actively prograding fold-thrust belt, changes in tectonics\nand drainage patterns are likely to be interlinked. The\noccurrence of nonmetamorphosed Lesser Himalaya in the\nsedimentary record at 9 Ma, and LHCS detritus at 6 Ma is\nindisputable evidence that these units had exhumed to\nsurface by this time, but still earlier exhumation of these\nunits, with their products of erosion diverted elsewhere, is a\nconcept that cannot be ruled out. In the present study, the\ngood temporal correlation between the tectonic events dated\nfrom bedrock geology [Caddick et al., 2007; Chambers et\nal., 2009; Thiede et al., 2005; Vannay et al., 2004] and the\ncoeval response in the sediment record, suggests a tectonic\ncause for the changes observed. In addition, our data\nTC5018 NAJMAN ET AL.: EXHUMATION OF THE LESSER HIMALAYA\n13 of 15\nTC5018\n(although not always interpretation) are similar to those\nobtained from analogous sedimentary studies many kilo-\nmeters along strike in Nepal [Bernet et al., 2006; DeCelles\net al., 1998; Huyghe et al., 2001; Robinson et al., 2001;\nSzulc et al., 2006] and our proposed timing for major\nthrusting of the Lesser Himalaya is consistent with the\ntiming proposed for this event along strike in Nepal\n[Robinson et al., 2006] and with an increase in sediment\naccumulation rates in the foreland basin at 11 Ma from\nPakistan to western Nepal, interpreted as the result of\nincreased subsidence due to loading by the major new thrust\nsystem of the Lesser Himalaya [Burbank et al., 1996; Ojha\net al., 2008].\n[37] Acknowledgments.
