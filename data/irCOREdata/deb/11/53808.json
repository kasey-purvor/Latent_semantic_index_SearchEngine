According to \nfigures from the organisation Headway [2], in the UK over 140 000 people are admitted \nto hospital due to brain injury every year, and over half the number of UK deaths in \npeople below 40 years of age are caused by brain injury. Survivors of brain injury have a \nnormal life expectancy and the number of survivors living with a long term disability as a \nconsequence of brain injury in the UK alone is around 500 000 [3].  \nDespite the prevalence and severe consequences of brain injury, research suggests \nthat the general public hold numerous misconceptions pertaining to its physical, cognitive \nand behavioural sequelae. Gouvier et al. [4] developed a questionnaire consisting of 25 \nstatements designed to examine knowledge about brain injury. They found that almost \nhalf of their sample held misconceptions relating to the nature of unconsciousness, the \nrecovery process and the impact of brain injury on cognitive status. Willer et al. [5] and \nGuilmette and Paglia [6] revealed similar misconceptions using a modified version of the \noriginal Gouvier et al. questionnaire. In both these surveys a high proportion of \nparticipants believed that survivors of brain injury only suffer temporary cognitive \ndeficits, and believed that even severe brain injury would not prevent someone from \nreturning to their previous employment.  \nMisconceptions about brain injury are not only displayed by the general public. \nSpringer et al. [7] reported that family members of patients who had sustained brain \ninjury held misconceptions, particularly concerning memory deficits, unconsciousness \nand recovery. Additionally, Swift and Wilson [8] showed that health professionals who \ndid not specialise in brain injury also endorsed misconceptions relating to recovery and \nBeliefs about brain injury 4 \ncognitive impairment, and further held misconceptions regarding the prognosis of brain \ninjury.  \nRecently, Hux et al. [9] sought to examine whether health campaigns had \nimproved the US public\u2019s understanding about the sequelae of brain injury previously \nreported by Gouvier et al. On the positive side, they reported marked improvements \npertaining to general knowledge about brain injury. However, misconceptions relating to \nunconsciousness, memory impairment and the recovery process were still prevalent in all \nsectors of the community. Although Hux et al. did not methodically derive information \nrelating to the source of knowledge about brain injury, they speculated on the basis of \ncomments made by respondents that the popular media is influential in fostering \nerroneous perceptions of brain injury. Consistent with this view, studies by Casarett et al. \n[10], Wijdicks [11] and a review by Baxendale [12] have indeed shown that the sequelae \nof brain injury portrayed by the media can be markedly inaccurate.  \nTo date, surveys examining misconceptions about brain injury have been \nconducted in the US and Canada. The aim of the present study is to test the hypothesis \nthat similar misconceptions that have been reported in those studies are also endorsed by \nadults in Britain. We also examine whether knowledge of brain injury in Britain differs as \na function of age, education and familiarity with brain injury. Further, we test the \nhypothesis that the media is an influential source of information from which many people \nderive their understanding of brain injury.   \n \nMethod \nBeliefs about brain injury 5 \nParticipants: Study participants were 322 individuals recruited through snowball \nsampling. These consisted of 125 (39%) male adults and 187 (58%) female adults, 10 \n(3%) respondents omitted details of sex. The mean age of the sample was 48 years (SD = \n18); 73 (23%) were between 18-29 years; 37 (11%) were between 30-39 years; 61 (19%) \nwere between 40-49 years; 73 (23%) were between 50-59 years; 47 (15%) were between \n60-69 years; 31 (10%) were aged over 70 years. A third of the sample (33%) knew either \na relative or close friend who had suffered brain injury; 57 (18%) participants had \npersonally sustained brain injury.  \nThe educational level of the sample was wide ranging; 8 (2%) of participants left \nschool before the age 15; 51 (16%) had achieved school level qualifications e.g. O level, \nGCSE, City & Guilds; 55 (17%) had achieved college level qualifications e.g. A level, \nIntermediate GNVQ, RSA Advanced Diploma; 25 (8%) had achieved higher college \nlevel qualifications e.g. HND, HNC, RSA Higher Diploma; 80 (25%) had gained a \ndegree and 93 (29%) had obtained a higher degree or postgraduate qualification; 10 (3%) \nrespondents omitted details of education. \nQuestionnaire: The questionnaire consisted of the 17 true or false statements (see \nTable 1) deployed by Hux et al. Items 1-4 relate to general knowledge about brain injury; \nitems 5-7 relate to unconsciousness and coma; items 8-11 relate to memory; items 12-17 \nrelate to brain injury and recovery. Items regarding demographic information and details \nof respondents\u2019 personal experience of brain injury were also included. The questionnaire \nconcluded with an open ended question asking respondents where they had learned about \nhead injuries. \nBeliefs about brain injury 6 \nProcedure: Participants were asked to complete a questionnaire designed to \nexamine the public\u2019s perception of head injury and recovery. They were informed that the \nquestionnaire would take between 5-10 minutes to complete and included 17 brief \nstatements which they would be required to decide was either \u201ctrue\u201d (T) or \u201cfalse\u201d (F). \nParticipants were assured that all data would remain anonymous and that they could \nwithdraw from the survey at any point. All participants gave informed consent prior to \nparticipating in the study. No incentives were provided. Upon completion all \nquestionnaires were returned either by post, email or personally to the first author who \nentered responses into a database.  \nData analysis: The proportion of participants with correct and incorrect responses \nto the 17 statements constituted the dependent measure of accurate and mistaken \nperceptions of brain injury and its sequelae respectively. Chi-square analyses were \nperformed on these data to compare differences between respondent sub-groups, and to \ncompare responses from this survey to those reported by Hux et al. \n \nResults \nThe percentage of participants who responded correctly to each of the 17 \nstatements is displayed in table 1. Overall, it is notable that the participants in this study \nheld similar misconceptions about brain injury and its sequelae as those who participated \nin the Hux et al. survey.  \nInsert table 1 about here \nMoreover, comparing the data between these two studies shows a greater \npercentage of the present respondents endorsed misconceptions relating to the following \nBeliefs about brain injury 7 \nareas: general knowledge of brain injury (items 1-4 mean = 20.4% vs. 8.3%; X2 = 10.53, \nP = 0.001); consciousness and coma (items 5-7 mean = 60.6% vs. 43.8%; X2 = 29.24, P = \n0.0001) and memory (items 8-11 mean = 63.4% vs. 54.7%; X2 = 11.96, P = 0.0005). The \ndifference in knowledge of recovery (items 12-17 mean = 48.2% vs. 44.3%; X2 = 2.79, P \n= 0.095) was less pronounced overall.  \nComparisons between grouping factors, showed males responded more accurately \nthan females to statement 2 (76.2% vs. 58.3%; X2 = 13.81, P = 0.003) and statement 7 \n(51.2% vs. 37%; X2 = 9.48, P = 0.024). \nParticipants were divided into three age bands; young (19-39 years), middle-aged \n(40-59 years) and older adults (over 60 years). This analysis showed that older adults \n(51.3%) were more accurate at correctly judging statement 11 to be true (middle-aged = \n37.3%; young = 31.8%; X2 = 21.14, P = 0.002).  \nEducational level was divided into two categories for analysis, participants who \nheld at least a first degree (55.5%) and participants without a degree (45.5%). A \nsignificant difference was only observed for statement 9, a greater percentage of \nrespondents with a degree answered this statement correctly (82.6% vs. 63.9%; X2 = \n14.86, P = 0.001). \nTo examine whether familiarity with brain injury survivors is associated to ones \nbeliefs about brain injury and its sequelae, two questions at the beginning of the survey \nasked respondents to firstly indicate whether they had personally suffered a head injury, \nand secondly to indicate if they knew a close friend or relative who had suffered a head \ninjury. The majority of participants answered \u2018no\u2019 to both these questions (60.1%); 10% \nanswered \u2018yes\u2019 to both; 7.3% had suffered a head injury themselves but didn\u2019t know a \nBeliefs about brain injury 8 \nrelative or friend who had; 22.6% had not suffered a head injury themselves but knew a \nrelative or friend who had sustained a head injury. Chi-square analysis showed that there \nwas no association between personal experience of brain injury and knowledge of brain \ninjury (X2 = 3.44, P = 0.752). \nFinally, 301 out of 322 participants (94%) provided responses to the open ended \nquestion \u201cWhere have you learnt about head injuries?\u201d Seven broad sources of \ninformation were identified. A large percentage of respondents indicated that their \nknowledge of brain injury had been derived from the \u2018media\u2019 e.g. TV, newspapers (38%). \nThis was followed by, \u2018personal experience\u2019 (17.3%); \u2018don\u2019t know\u2019 (16.9%); \u2018general \nknowledge\u2019 e.g. life experience (16.6%); \u2018word of mouth\u2019 e.g. conversation, hearsay \n(10.6%); \u2018professional experience\u2019 e.g. nursing, army services (6.6%) and \u2018first aid \ncourse\u2019 (3.7%).     \n \nDiscussion \nThe results of this study show that misconceptions about brain injury that have \nbeen endorsed in several studies conducted in the US and Canada [4,6,8,9] are also \nendorsed by the general public in Britain. Indeed, the magnitude of misconceptions held \nby respondents in the present study were on the whole markedly greater than those \nreported previously for issues pertaining to general knowledge of brain injury, \nconsciousness and coma and memory deficits. Respondents in this survey are all of \ncourse potential victims of brain injury themselves, either directly as a patient, or \nindirectly through relations with others. From either of these perspectives, endorsement \nof the misconceptions that have been evidenced may have a negative impact on attitudes \nBeliefs about brain injury 9 \ntowards rehabilitation and recovery. For example, patients who are unaware that brain \ninjury commonly produces memory deficits; or believe that complete recovery from a \nsevere head injury is possible as long as the individual works hard at recovery, may have \nunrealistic expectations of a full recovery. They may therefore experience lower self \nesteem, increased levels of anxiety, depression and frustration if their perceived \nexpectations of recovery are not achieved. Acquaintances who share similar \nmisconceptions, may view lapses in memory less sympathetically, and feel frustrated too, \nbelieving that the patient could put more effort into recovering [14]. More catastrophic \nramifications could ensue if patients or caregivers are unaware that brain injury increases \nthe probability of receiving subsequent brain injury, and that the consequences of \nrepetitive injury while still symptomatic can result in malignant cerebral oedema, which \nis potentially fatal [13].  \nHux et al. speculated that popular forms of media play a role in perpetuating \nmisconceptions about brain injury; and in this survey a large number of participants \nindicated that their knowledge of brain injury had in fact been informed by the media. An \ninteresting review by Baxendale [12] describes how misconceptions about amnesia have \nhistorically been portrayed in movies. For example, a large percentage of participants in \nthis survey endorsed the view that brain injury commonly produces a profound retrograde \namnesia but not the ability to learn new information, in movies this is a popular scenario \n(Finding the Way Home; Matrimonial Bed; The Bourne Identity). The notion that \namnesia can be cured by a second brain injury is another implausible but popular scenario \nportrayed in movies (Overboard; Tarzan the Tiger). In addition to improbable patterns of \namnesia, Baxendale argues that some movies depict memory impairments which are \nBeliefs about brain injury 10 \nactually neurologically impossible (Clean Slate; 50 First Dates), while only a very small \nnumber in fact present an accurate account of amnesia (Finding Nemo; Memento). The \nprimary aim of movies, TV dramas and soap operas is of course to entertain and not \ninform. However, research into the concept of dramatic licence by Garfield and Millwood \nHargrave [15] showed that although the British public accept this tenet and do not expect \nto be educated through these medium, they do expect a degree of verisimilitude \nespecially pertaining to medical issues. According to these authors, \u2018When participants \nwere asked if they had learnt anything from a drama, most spontaneously said no or they \ndid not watch drama for information. However there were comments which implied that \nviewers may learn or gather information subconsciously, raising concerns about the \nimplications of inaccurate information\u2019 (p.25).  \nIn sum, despite the prevalence of brain injury the British public endorse a number \nof misconceptions pertaining to its sequelae. In particular there appears to be: a) a \nmisunderstanding of the nature of unconsciousness; b) an underestimation of the memory \ndeficits that commonly follow brain injury; and c) inaccuracies relating to the complexity \nof the recovery process and risks associated with successive brain injury. Endorsing these \nmisconceptions \u2013 which for many appear to be at least partly influenced by how the \npopular media portrays brain injury, can impede the recovery process and exacerbate the \npsychological symptoms experienced by both patients and family members. It is \nimportant that neuropsychologists and other health professionals recognise that the \ngeneral public may have mistaken beliefs about brain injury, and endeavour to dispel \nthese myths in the clinic and through health campaigns. Greater public awareness is \ncritical for patient care and for decisions concerning the allocation of financial resources.\nBeliefs about brain injury 11 \nDeclaration of interest: A close relative of the first author has sustained brain injury. \n  \nBeliefs about brain injury 12 \nReferences \n \n[1] International Brain Injury Association [Internet].
