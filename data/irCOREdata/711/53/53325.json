Information interfaces and presentation (e.g., HCI): \nMiscellaneous.  \nINTRODUCTION \nIt is generally acknowledged amongst scientists and, \nincreasingly, politicians and corporations that current levels \nof energy consumption are not sustainable [25]. Many \npeople already know very well that they consume too much \nenergy at home and fly too often. And yet they do next to \nnothing to change this. Indeed a recent article in the \nEcologist on unnecessary travel was written on board a \ntransatlantic Boeing 747 flight [30]. At the moment we \nwant to cut carbon emissions without changing our \nlifestyles; we do not want sustainable technologies but \nperhaps we want to want them. How then can technologies \ndesigned to change behaviour become compelling, \ndesirable and enjoyable? \nIt is increasingly recognised that interaction design must \naddress issues of sustainability, e.g. [4, 24, 33]. There has \nbeen much work in HCI in the past decade on persuasive \ntechnology, e.g. [9, 18, 23]. However Fogg recently pointed \nout that persuasive technologies very often fail and urged \npractitioners to think small [19]. Monitoring technologies \nalone (e.g. pedometers) are often not enough to make \nmeaningful changes in behaviour. This paper draws on \nprevious work on persuasive technologies, e.g. [18, 19] in \norder to address environmental concerns over domestic \nenergy consumption.  \nHouseholds are responsible for 30% of the UK\u201fs total \nenergy use [12]. Since 1970, household energy demands \nhave grown by 32% [29] and still continue to grow. Energy \ndemands have grown because of increases in home \ntemperature and the proliferation of consumer electronics \n[14]. Ulrick Beck identifies increasingly individualized \nforms of living such as: \u201cliving alone, single parenthood, \nnon-marital cohabitation, childless marriage, serial \nmarriage\u201d and \u201cliving apart together\u201d, where partners live \nin separate dwellings\u201d [2]. The impacts of these trends are \nsocial but also environmental in that one person living \nalone uses more energy than two in the same household [3]. \nRising energy consumption currently means increased CO2 \nemissions so domestic energy consumption is very much a \nworld problem e.g. [20, 46]. \nThis paper reports on the design, deployment and \nevaluation of a Facebook application which aimed to \nencourage energy saving by using live and historical energy \nfeedback in a social-normative context. \n \n \nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for \npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are \nnot made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies \nbear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

Studies \nin Environmental Psychology have shown that feedback on \nenergy consumption can achieve behavioural change \nthough it is not necessarily sustained without timely \nreminders [11, 16].  The goal of this project therefore, was \nnot just to effect behavioural change but to demonstrate \nlarger reductions in energy consumption through the \naddition of a social aspect in monitoring energy usage. \nThe desire to belong and willingness to adapt behaviour to \nfollow what others are doing has been seen as a \nfundamental motivator [1]. Social norms such as peer \npressure have also been seen as a means of changing \nbehaviour to align with the ideas or beliefs of groups [41]. \nIt has been argued that computers now operate as social \nactors designed to influence our behaviour, filling the roles \nof teachers, sales people and health agents and [17, 18]. \nComputers have, for example, been shown to help people \novercome their fear of public speaking [43].  Recent work \non persuasive technology has argued that reciprocal \ninteraction through instant messaging and \u201cpokes\u201d can be \neffective strategies for persuasion [47]. Whilst there is \ninsufficient space to give a full account of the psychological \ntheories of social motivation, effecting behavioural change \nthrough computer mediated social networks seems \npromising.  \nEnergy Monitors \nIn many homes, electricity meters are often difficult to \naccess (located in cupboards or corners) and usually \ndifficult to read. Energy measurements in kilowatts are \ndifficult to make sense of either in terms of finance or \necological impact [8]. Dynamically updating kilowatt \nreadings are however much more understandable [48]. \nStudies of paper electricity bills have also shown that \nawareness and understanding can be increased through \ngraphical representations of financial and normative \ncomparisons [10]. However bills do not provide frequent \nfeedback and a recent study found that continuous feedback \nover a long period is the best means of changing patterns of \nenergy consumption [16]. The importance of raising \nawareness about patterns of consumption can be illustrated \nwith reference to still widely held but mistaken beliefs \nabout domestic appliances. One study of mistaken folk \ntheories of energy consumption found that there was still \ncredence given to such myths as - turning a thermostat up \nhigher than necessary heats a room up quicker, and - \nleaving computers and lights on consumes less energy than \nturning them on and off frequently [28].   \nThe Wattson home energy monitor is a standalone device \nwhich is designed to raise awareness of domestic energy \nconsumption.  It is an off the shelf technology which takes \nreadings from electricity metres and displays the \ninformation as real-time energy usage data. It has a light \nsystem that provides ambient feedback as well as a \nnumerical display that can show units like watts and pounds \nsterling.   \nFigure 1: The Wattson energy monitor from DIY Kyoto \nSmart monitors such as the Wattson are increasingly \ncommon and The UK government has committed to \nreplacing all current electricity metres with smart metres by \n2020. This is no guarantee that it will happen of course, but \nit indicates that the availability of such devices is likely to \nincrease.   \nFacebook \nThe social networking site Facebook now has over 250 \nmillion active users [15]. If the site were a country its \npopulation would be greater than that of Russia. Studies of \nFacebook have demonstrated that users read other people\u201fs \npostings, play games, upload comments on photographs and \nadd to their own \u201eprofile\u201f many times daily [27]. These sites \nprovide a powerful means of delivering small, \nasynchronous applications to peer groups of likeminded \nreal-world friends in a manageable and pleasant way. There \nmay then be potential in leveraging the engaging power of \nsmall applications, offering rich social interactive features \nto change behaviour.  \nFeedback Studies \nIn recent years there have been many studies of innovative \nways of displaying energy consumption. The \u201cpower aware \ncord\u201d offers per-appliance feedback in the form of a \nglowing power cord but does not indicate energy used or \ncost [21]. The use of portable and stationary, minimalist \ndirect displays for the home was investigated in another \nrecent study [48]. This found that occupants would move \naround the house turning appliances on and off to monitor \nthe change of feedback on the portable display they carried \nand  enjoyed this playful approach (ibid). The Phillips iCat \nstudy used a robot with happy or sad facial expressions \ncorresponding to low or high energy use scenarios in a lab \n[37]. Although the study was limited to the lab and \ninvolved the use of a very expensive robot it indicated that \nparticipants responded more positively to the playful \nexpression of the cat rather than a bar chart [22].  \nThe two previously discussed studies did not employ the \nuse of any normative feedback, social or otherwise. But \nsome work has been carried out in using social platforms to \nmotivate people to reduce their ecological impact. Mankoff \n[34] proposed the use of web widgets like \u201cbadges\u201d \nshowing carbon footprints which could be incorporated on \nplatforms like MySpace but the proposed implementation \nrelied on users self-reporting their energy information. \nA recent study used a large situated display to compare \nenergy consumption between dormitories of a university \ncampus showing expenditure by both halls and individuals. \nThe display was only updated bi-weekly yet resulted in \nmassive reductions in electricity and water [36]. A \nFacebook group was created for the study but did not have \na high uptake. A Facebook group network can only be fed \nupdates in the form of self-reported textual or static image \nposts with little guided or sophisticated interaction. \nFacebook applications provide a more personalised \nexperience through access to the users profile, profile \nactions and news feed.  A Facebook application displaying \npersonal student energy usage tied into each student\u201fs \nunique Facebook account profile may have been more \neffective.  \nThis study aimed to address a gap in current work on \nleveraging social platforms by embedding live, continuous \nenergy data into a fully interactive socially-enabled energy \napplication. Using the Facebook Developers Kit (FDK) \nAPI, Wattson devices were linked to Facebook allowing us \nto investigate whether sharing such information between \nfriends might make for further reductions in energy \nconsumption. \nDESIGN PROCESS \nFocus groups were conducted with a convenience sample \n[40] of four Facebook users aged between twenty three and \nthirty eight. There were three males and one female and all \nwere responsible for paying the energy bills in their homes. \nDiscussions took place in a home lab on campus at a \nuniversity and helped the participants focus on the home as \na design space. It should be noted that as the participants \nwere students on a Masters course in HCI they were more \nsensitive to issues of interface design than other groups \nmight be.  \nParticipants were shown the Wattson monitor and a \nselection of YouTube videos related to energy \nconsumption. One video featured a Wattson monitor over a \nperiod of a few minutes displaying live home energy \nreadings, from low to high when a cooker is switched on; \nsimultaneously, a \u201cNabaztag\u201d outputs a vocal message that \na lot of energy is being used at that moment and flashes its \nlights.  \n \nFigure 2: WattsOn and Nabaztag YouTube Video  \nParticipants commented on the comic potential of the \ndevice and the possibility of fun, playful interactions. This \ngenerated general discussions around the concept design of \na socially enabled home energy monitor and what that \nmight look like.  \nPencils, coloured pens, scissors and other craft materials \nwere also provided allowing participants to create their own \ninterface elements.  \nFigure 3: Initial Sketches developed in focus group \nA large number of ideas were generated and discussed. \nVarious graphical metaphors were suggested such as a \nmouse running in a cage turning faster or slower depending \non energy consumption, balloons with user\u201fs faces on them \nwere pictured being inflated larger or smaller and floating \nhigher or lower to indicate ranked consumption rates (see \nfigure 3.  There were a number of interesting suggestions. \nFor instance:  \u201ca digital photo frame, if you aren\u2019t using \nmuch energy then you see pictures of beautiful scenery or if \nyou\u2019re using a lot some stark scenery, almost like a piece of \nart that changes over time\u201d. Smiley and sad faces were also \nsuggested as simple but very easily understood graphical \nelements (see Figure 5). \nThe participants were then given a paper materials pack \ncontaining various paper interface elements such as user \navatar icons, energy icons and CO2 icons to help create \nprototype interfaces. Plain interface template cards were \nadded to the pack enabling the participants to place the \ninterface elements on the blank interface templates.  \n Figure 4: Interface elements given to participants \nMuch of the discussion revolved around the difficulty of \nrelating to the kilowatt as a unit of energy measurement. \n\u201cKilowatts, watts, I don\u2019t want to see any of that, money \nyes.\u201d There were interesting debates about whether \nfinancial representations were more powerful than \necological ones \u201cI\u2019m thinking a kind of erm some form of \nvisual presentation....you\u2019ll see more trees over time in an \nimage if you use less energy, see trees knocked down if you \nuse more\u201d  There were also interesting  general discussions \nof issues such as privacy when sharing data raising \nconcerns such as: \u201cThe risk of failure in front of your \nfriends.\u201d However it was generally agreed that introducing \na competitive element between friends who were free to opt \nin or out of the group might help drive a reduction in \nconsumption. \nIMPLEMENTATION \nMoving on from the conceptual design stage was made \nrelatively straight forward due to the high quality of the \nuser generated designs. Following discussions in the focus \ngroup it was decided that the main interface attributes for \ndisplaying energy would be expressed in Watts and pounds \nsterling (\u00a3) as well as CO2 emissions measured by weight. \nIn addition to numerical representations, a graphical \nrepresentation was selected to display alongside both \nnumerical values for energy and Co2 emissions in the form \nof the happy\/sad face theme as previously discussed. \nThree core interfaces were developed to provide an \nengaging user experience: My Energy, Friends and \nRankings. The My Energy screen would show energy \nconsumption with a dial visualisation and a seven day \nhistory bar chart. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 5: My Energy: Workshop sketches and final design \nSketches developed in the workshop (see the left hand side \nof figure 5) were developed into final designs (see the right \nhand side of figure 5). Workshop comments also informed \nthe design e.g.: \u201cWhat the dials can do is give you a \ncomparison, although they are very abstract, I can still tell \nif I have used loads of energy today.\u201d The final design then \nrelated quite directly to initial discussions. \nThe Friends screen would display personal energy \nconsumption against selected friends. \n \nFigure 6: \u201cFriends\u201d screen final design  \nAgain this final design built directly on ideas and comments \nfrom the workshop \u201cI can see it working amongst a group \nof friends, but finding a way to notify users of the group of \nwhats happening\u2019\u201d.  \nThe Rankings screen would show a table of highest and \nlowest energy users of the application. \n \n \nFigure 7; Rankings Screen, Initial workshops sketches and \nfinal design.  \nAgain there was a very direct link between the final design \nand workshop suggestions such as \u201c\u201eI thought about a \nleagues table based on points, slightly competitive but not \nwith pressure and a bit where people can discuss it\u2019\u201d and \nrough sketches such as those on the left hand side of Figure \n7. The ranked pyramid of the heaviest consumers suggested \nin the workshop (see the bottom left hand side of Figure7) \nwas simplified to a ranking table similar to that imagined in \nanother workshop sketch (top left hand side of Figure 7).  \nAnother important interface element was the integration of \na comments board. The rankings table would allow users to \nvisualise what their standing was against others but it would \nnot facilitate friends commenting on personal or others\u201f \nenergy consumption. This feature was added following \ndiscussions of the importance of interacting with friends \nthrough such an application. A cloud tag feature was also \nadded where users could note the devices they thought were \nhigh energy users.  \nAs with any prototype design, choices were limited by time \nand material constraints. A number of interesting concepts \nwere generated in the workshop which were not feasible \nwithin the scope of the project. As is well documented in \nthe participatory design literature, the sketching process \nwas invaluable not only in generating the final designs but \nalso in recognizing a wider design space e.g. [6].  \nDEPLOYMENT  \nThe application was developed using ASP.NET, Microsoft \nC#, HTML\/CSS, XML, MySQL, Facebook Markup \nLanguage, and the FDK API. When completed it was \ndeployed to the Facebook application platform. \nTo afford the functionality displaying live and recent \nenergy data within a Facebook application, an elaborate \napplication framework was designed and implemented as \nseen in Figure 8. \n \n \nFigure 8: Technical Design Overview \nThe diagram illustrates the Wattson sensor at the \nhouseholders fuse box sending the current energy reading \nby radio signal to the Wattson energy monitor which stores \nthe data in its 30 day dedicated memory. The Wattson is \nphysically attached to a PC via a USB cable which \ntransports the energy data from the Wattson to the PC via \nthe desktop \u201cPowometer\u201d application where it is stored in a \nlocal SQL mobile database. At configured intervals \nPowometer sends the stored energy data to the \nmyenergyusage.org service via the internet where it is \nstored in multiple MySQL databases for redundancy. Once \nthe energy data is stored on the myenergyusage.org \ndatabases it is then presentable to authorised applications to \nmake use of it. The Wattsup technical design and \nimplementation tasks were approached using Evolutionary \nPrototyping [38]. \nEXPERIMENTAL METHOD \nAim \nThe aim of the study was to see if energy savings could be \nincreased by the addition of a social element to monitoring. \nAs it is already known that monitoring can reduce energy \nconsumption the focus was on the social element and we \ndid not consider households without any energy monitors of \nany kind. To this end, we made a socially enabled version \nof the Wattson energy monitor via Facebook. The \nhypothesis was that less energy would be used whilst the \nWattson was socially enabled than when it was not socially \nenabled. \nParticipants \nEight households were recruited to trial the prototype with \neach participant being the person responsible for paying the \nelectricity bill. The number of participating households was \nlimited by the number of devices available to the \nresearchers. Selection of the participants followed a \npurposive sampling method [40]. The criteria for \n recruitment were that the lead participant in each household \nmust be responsible for paying their household electricity \nbill and be a daily user of the Facebook website. None of \nthe households had owned any type of energy monitor prior \nto the study. \nParticipant Profession Age No. Household \nMembers \nDiane Nurse 26 2 \nAlice Nurse 23 2 \nRachael \nOffice \nAdmin \n49 2 \nChristopher Programmer 32 2 \nRobert \nSchool \nTeacher \n41 2 \nDavid Student 31 2 \nRichard Student 20 4 \nShirley Writer 40 4 \nTable 1: Wattsup participant demographics \nThe participants were also recruited in 4 pairs who \nresembled one another in circumstances as much as \npossible. For example if a participant belonged to a family \nof four then another participant belonging to a family of \nfour was recruited. In total the participants belonged to \nhouseholds with 6 couples and 2 families of four, so twenty \npeople in all were involved in this study. The lead \nparticipants had all been regular users of Facebook for at \nleast one year and were all friends who were on one \nanother\u201fs Facebook friends list. Additional demographical \ninformation on the participants is detailed in Table 1 with \npseudonyms used in place of the participant\u201fs real names. \nDesign \nThe experiment followed a within subjects design [7] with \neach participant taking part in two conditions or social \nmodes. In condition A the Wattsup application was socially \nenabled, i.e. users could see their friends\u201f data as well as \ntheir own, in condition B the Wattsup application was \nmanipulated so that there were no social features i.e. users \ncould only see their own energy usage.  \nThe households were divided into matched groups and the \nconditions were counterbalanced between the groups to \navoid ordering effects [7]. Group 1 started in condition A, \ngroup 2 in condition B and the groups switched conditions \nhalfway through. \nThe independent variable was therefore the Facebook \napplication\u201fs social mode, either enabled or disabled. The \ndependent variable was the energy used in Kilowatt Hour \nunits with a total measurement being taken in each \ncondition for each household. \nProcedure \nThe experiment required hardware in the form of a Wattson \nenergy monitor and a Windows based PC running the \nPowometer desktop software available from \nwww.myenergyusage.org to collect energy data from the \nWattson monitor. The Wattson monitor was installed along \nwith the required desktop software one week before the \nexperiment officially began. This was done to assist in \nreducing any effects on participants\u201f energy usage by \ninitially using the Wattson on its own, as it was likely to \nreceive attention as a new gadget in the house (and, as \npreviously noted, decrease energy consumption).  \nEach participant gave their informed consent and carried \nout the experiment in their own home. The experiment took \nplace over a period of 18 days with 9 days in each \ncondition. Half of the participants started in condition A \nwith the other half starting in condition B, after 9 days the \nparticipants were sent an email through Facebook \ninforming them of the changeover of conditions. The \napplications were then reprogrammed to perform in the \nalternative conditions with the relevant participants. \nData was collected in the Wattson device itself, a MS SQL \nmobile database using the installed desktop software and \nthe myenergyusage.org web service via a MySQL database. \nThe Google analytics service was also used to record the \nnumber of Facebook application page views for each \ninterface. \nRESULTS \nThe energy usage, in kWH, in both conditions for each \nhousehold is summarised in Figure 9. \n \nFigure 9: Wattsup participant energy usage in each condition \n A Wilcoxon test, for comparing repeated measures of non-\nparametric data, showed that energy consumption was \nsignificantly lower when using the socially enabled \napplication (Z= -2.1, N=8, p=0.036). \nA total of 130Kw units of energy saved by the participants \nin condition A as opposed to condition B. This amount of \nenergy would be expended by leaving a 60W bulb on for 9 \ndays and result in Co2 emissions similar to those produced \nby driving an average-sized UK petrol car for 399Km. \nAdditional data collected from Google Analytics \nhighlighted the differences in user interaction activity \nbetween both conditions. In terms of the number of times \nthe participants visited Wattsup, condition A was \nsignificantly more popular than condition B with a total of \n263 versus 51 page views respectively. The number of \nvisits to the Facebook application then showed a fivefold \nincrease in the social condition. Participants spent most \ntime on the rankings interface viewing and commenting on \nthe rankings table. It can be assumed that participants \nenjoyed this feature the most due to the collective amount \nof page views for rankings as well as the average time spent \nviewing it \nHowever with such a low number of participants it is worth \nexploring the result further by analysing the qualitative data \ncollected. \nQUALITATIVE DATA \nIn addition to the descriptive and inferential statistics \nqualitative data analysis was undertaken on the comments \nboard and on semi structured interviews following the trial.  \nComments board \nThe comments board proved to be a popular feature with \nparticipants and comments were analysed using a small \nscale  grounded theory approach [44]. Three main \ncategories of comment emerged: banter, engagement and \ncompetition. Banter included teasing such as \u201chow come \nyou are at the top, cut down drastically on your cups of \ntea?\u201d And gloating \u201cgood to see I'm higher in the table \nthen you rob ha ha\u201d as well as provocations such as \n\u201c\u201cenergy vampire...you clearly are!!\u201d\u201d. This kind of banter \nextended to joking exchanges such as:  \nDiane: \u201cI\u2019ve turned my washing machine \nsettings down as this uses loads...no pun \nintended\u201d \nAlice: \u201cI once turned down a washing machine. \nWasn't pretty. It went into a cycle of depression \nand self-loathing before finally giving me my \nsocks back\u201d \nEngagement included disclosure of information such as \n\u201cLeft my main PC on the last two nights. Made a massive \ndifference to my scores.\u201d And disbelief about energy usage \n\u201cgone down in the rankings? I\u00b4m in Spain :S\u201d Engagement \ncould indicate enjoyment \u201cWoohooo, looking good today!\u201d \nbut sometimes also mixed feelings of guilt and \ndisinclination to change \u201cI NEED TO STOP PLAYING \nPUTER! (idontwanttoidontwanttoidontwantto)\u201d. \nOther comments indicated  pleasure in the competitive \naspect of the rankings \u201cTake\u2019s the top spot: D\u201d this seemed \nenjoyable even to those who were not necessarily winning \n\u201cI've been usurped\u201d. This competitive element occasionally \nled to questions \u201chey [name omitted] what\u2019s your secret? \nyour energy rating is pretty good...\u201d. Comments were made \nwhen participants moved both up and down the ranking \ntable indicating engagement in the process throughout.  \nSemi-Structured Interviews \nParticipants took part in semi structured interviews about \ntheir experience with the set uy when the Wattson device \nwas collected from their homes at the end of the study. \nThey were asked: which condition they preferred and why, \nwhether they had any problems using Wattsup and whether \nthey would use it or something similar over a longer period \nof time.  \nAll of the participants preferred the socially enabled \ncondition \u201cI preferred the second one (socially) because I \nam quite competitive, it gave me further incentive. I think \nputting a bit of fun in it is quite important.\u201d. All of the \nparticipants said they would be very interested in using the \nsystem over a longer period of time. With regard to \nproblems using the device some suggested a more visual \nrepresentation of Co2 emissions.  \nAs with other energy reduction systems participants found \nmonitoring itself quite enjoyable:  \n\u201cWell, this morning we unplugged \nEVERYTHING one by one, room by room. The \nreading on the wattson went down by around \n450 to 970 watts. Ha, we actually enjoyed \ninvestigating this though ;)\u201d \nAlthough financial and ecological concerns may also be \nimportant factors this and other studies clearly indicate that \nfun should be taken seriously, eg [5].  \nDISCUSSION \nOne UK study claimed that sustained behavioural change \nwith domestic energy consumption was unlikely to alter \nuntil more than 3 months had elapsed [11]. However, the \nenergy feedback in that study was not delivered within a \nsocially enabled context; therefore it is possible that the \nclaim of 3 months minimum for energy usage behaviour \nchange may not hold when a social platform is used to \ndeliver the feedback. Due to time constraints and resources \navailable this project could not address the experiment \nduration issue for sustained behaviour change. These \nfindings then may be viewed as a pilot study potentially \nleading onto a larger and longer term study.  \nBut the approach may be criticised more generally. It  could \nbe argued, for instance, that computers are part of the \nproblem and not the solution. Part of the reason for the \nmassive increases in domestic energy consumption is the \nproliferation of computers and other energy intensive \ndevices. In 1995 29% of the UK population owned a PC, in \n2006 this had more than doubled to 65% [35]. The power \nsupply of today\u201fs computers is around 300w and growing \nas technology progresses, significantly more than \ncomputers of the 1990s [39]. Increasingly sophisticated \ncomponents such as graphics cards and processors are using \nmore energy with each subsequent generation. \nIt is difficult to find reliable figures estimating the carbon \nfootprint of an entity like Facebook. Some estimates place \n the number of servers necessary as 10,000 with an \nadditional 300,000 user PCs connected at any one time [32, \n42].  While all carbon footprint estimates are disputable the \nfootprint of Facebook and its users is clearly large, perhaps, \nas some claim, the equivalent of a major city. The number \nof Facebook users is often compared to the populations of \nnations. If Facebook is a country you need a computer to \nlive in it. Using Facebook to reduce energy consumption \nthen may be rather like eating more pies in order to lose \nweight. \nHowever there may be a value to endeavours such as this \nbeyond an immediate and measurable net reduction of \npersonal energy consumption. Such studies cannot help but \nraise awareness of energy consumption if only because of \nthe Hawthorne effect. For ecological change to take place \nthere must also be ideological change. This study generated \na considerable amount of press interest [e.g. 45] which   \nindicates that sustainability is now a very real concern of \nusers. That said, the focus on individuals and personal \nenergy consumption must not detract from larger political \ninterventions. As Paul Dourish has argued we must raise \nawareness not just of the ecological consequences of \nleaving the lights on but the consequences of our decisions \nat the ballot box [13].  \nIt has been argued that in an age of potential ecological \ncatastrophe user centred design is no longer appropriate \n[e.g. 4]. The user\u201fs needs and preferences should not take \nprecedent over the impact of their technologies on the \nenvironment. However this is to configure the user solely as \na consumer. Users may also be considered as citizens. \nAlthough some scientists continue to doubt that global \nwarming can be attributed to human activity it is clear that a \ngreat many users \/ citizens are now entirely persuaded and \nwant to do something about it. The impact of our \ntechnologies is a real concern at the level of user \nexperience.  User experience is already broadly conceived \nin terms of social and psychological perspectives, it is \nbecoming clear that it must be conceived in still wider \nterms to address the ecological challenges of the coming \nyears. \nSlavoj Zizek has argued that enjoyment is a political factor \nin any social structure, even, or especially if it is extremely \nrepressive. The jokes and private satires against the party in \ncommunist states were no threat to the regime, indeed they \nwere entirely necessary for its smooth running [49]. \nLovelock has argued that if we were to take the ecological \nchallenges that we face seriously then we would adopt \nsystems of rationing much harsher than those of the second \nworld war [31]. Even if the cataclysmic predictions of \nclimate change are wrong it is clear that the way we \nconsume energy must change. If harsh measures are to be \nendured then perhaps we must find ways to enjoy them. \nCONCLUSION \nThe paper has described the design, deployment and \nevaluation of a Facebook application designed to allow \nfriends to compare their domestic energy consumption.  \nThe quantitative and qualitative analysis of the data \ncollected from participants in this study suggests that social \nnetworking sites may be able to play a role in reducing \nenergy consumption in the home by making monitoring \nmore enjoyable.  \nThis was a small scale study and only a larger investigation \ncould conclusively determine how effective such \napplications may be. However, these results are \nencouraging. Competitive carbon counting appears to be \nboth more enjoyable and more effective than individual \nmonitoring.    \nThe limits of how much any individual can achieve by \nchanging their own lifestyles are often pointed out. But \ncollective behaviour change even on a small scale is \nincreasingly recognized as a key to tackling global \nwarming. The International Energy Agency, for instance, \nestimate that devices on standby cause a full one percent of \nworld greenhouse emissions, this is nearly equal to that of \nthe entire aviation industry[46].   \nSocial networking sites like Facebook and Twitter are \nincreasingly being appropriated by users for political and \nsocial ends. Facebook is of course primarily for fun but it \nmay be that the enjoyable aspects of the service make for \neffective platforms for persuasive technologies. \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nThe authors wish to express their sincere appreciation to the \nproject participants and their families for their invaluable \nassistance in the research and development of this project\u201fs. \nParticular thanks also go to Crispin Proctor for giving \npermission and assistance in accessing energy data online \nfrom the myenergyusage.org web service.
