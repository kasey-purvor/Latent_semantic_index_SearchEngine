Different ways to improve\nindoor air quality were reviewed, ranging from source control to education of occupants on how to\nmanage the built environment to achieve healthy and acceptable indoor air. Through literature study,\norganised workshops with scientific experts and building professionals, as well as via interviews with\nthree stakeholder groups: producers of construction products, architects and housing corporations;\nrequirements for information, guidance and actions to improve indoor air quality were identified.\nThese requirements formed the basis of a possible approach to improve indoor air quality: education\nand awareness, regulations and policies, and further research and development.\n3INTRODUCTION\nThe need to address the issues of indoor environment at the EU level is recognised, by the\nEnvironment and Health Action Plan of the Commission of the European Communities (CEC) which\nwas launched in 2004 [1], the World Health Organisation (WHO) ministerial declaration [2], and, also\nthe Strategic Research Agenda of the European Construction Technology Platform [3]. In the\nEuropean community, Indoor environment is considered to be an important determinant of an\nindividual\u2019s health, particularly when considering that people spend majority of their life indoors,\nespecially at homes where on average nearly 16 hours per day during the week and 17 hours per day\nduring the weekend. For children and elderly people, these figures are even higher [4].\nIn the past, the provision of appropriate ventilation was considered to be the sole means of achieving\ngood indoor air quality (IAQ) and it was not until the 1990s, that an additional approach, source\ncontrol, was considered. Furnishing and construction materials, ventilation system components and\nactivities performed by people indoors, can be important sources of pollution, and therefore a\nventilation rate based on carbon dioxide (CO2) production by building occupants, is increasingly being\nrecognised as not valid in buildings where CO2 is not the dominant source of pollution [5]. The\nidentification and characterisation of indoor pollution sources and the development of guidelines to\ncontrol them is on-going [6]. During the last decade, there has been a transition in research with a\nfocus on primary emission source to more of an emphasis on secondary emission phenomena, such as\nproducts of ozone initiated indoor chemistry [7, 8] and chemicals and biological particles arising from\nthe growth of micro-organisms on interior surfaces [9, 10, 11].\nRegarding IAQ, several initiatives have been undertaken at European level ranging from establishing\nexposure threshold values of pollutants to labelling of products and even labelling of buildings:\n- The development of harmonized test methods for the release or emission of dangerous substances\nto satisfy the requirements of Essential Requirement No. 3 (ER 3) of the Construction Products\nDirective (CPD) [6].\n- A standardised voluntary approach for the delivery of environmental information on construction\nproducts, and to assess the environmental performance of buildings [12].\n- Harmonisation of several national labelling schemes for construction and furnishing products [13,\n14, 15].\n- REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals) [16].\n- Several European funded projects including the recently completed co-ordination action on Indoor\nair quality and health effects (ENVIE) [17].\nIt is clear that IAQ is still an important issue despite the various initiatives and projects that have\nalready been undertaken. In recognition of this, the European project HealthyAir was initiated as a\n4network project sponsored by the Executive Agency for Health and Consumers (formerly Public\nHealth Executive Agency) under the management of DG Sanco (Directorate General for Health and\nConsumer Affairs of the European Commission) to identify ways forward to improve IAQ.\nMETHODOLOGY\nThe three-year HealthyAir project started in April 2007 with the following general objective:\nTo define, initiate and develop activities that will improve indoor air quality and reduce exposure of\npeople to indoor air pollution sources, in particularly, construction products.\nThree consecutive steps were taken to fulfil this objective.\n- Step 1: A State of the art review of the facts and problems related to IAQ from three points of\nview: the human, the indoor air of the space and the sources contributing to indoor air pollution; to\naddress the question \u2018Why is indoor air quality (still) an issue?\u2019\n- Step 2: Information exchange in the form of a workshop, interviews and a forum was used as a\nmeans to answer the questions: \u2018Is IAQ recognised as an issue by the key stakeholders concerned\nwith the provision, management and uses of the built environments, such as the architect, product\nproducers, and also the end-user, and if not how can awareness of the issue be raised?\u2019\nConsideration was given to the knowledge status of the stakeholders on IAQ, the information\navailable to them and its adequacy to meet their needs, as well as the most effective methods of\ncommunicating.\n- Step 3: A possible approach was defined to address the question, \u2019What can or should be done to\nreach the next level?\u2019 This includes actions and methods to improve IAQ ranging from education\nto regulation and research opportunities.\nSTATE OF THE ART\nThe state of the art review was undertaken to identify the current state of knowledge on IAQ. In the\nreview indoor air quality was approached from three points of view [18]:\n- The human well-being as the receiver and perceiver of health and comfort\n- The indoor air of the space as the carrier\n- The sources as emitters and contributors to indoor air pollution.\nThese are three distinct but inter-related aspects of IAQ. A source (or sources) emits pollutants into the\nindoor air of a space, directly or indirectly. Those pollutants can react with each other or with\npollutants from other sources including outdoor sources, creating new compounds (i.e. indoor air\nchemistry). Also, pollutants can react with surface materials in the building. A person entering or\noccupying the indoor space would be exposed to those pollutants present in the air of that space; this\ncan possibly induce a physiological response or a health effect, immediately or sometime after,\n5probably influenced by previous and \u201cfuture\u201d exposures in the same or other spaces [18]. It can\ntherefore be difficult to relate a particular response or health effect to a pollutant or a source of\nemission. Experiments using laboratory controlled exposures of subjects to specific pollutants\nfocusing on particular responses have been carried out [18] but even then, people\u2019s response can vary\nwidely and it can be difficult to relate the results to the multi-pollutant exposures and other\nenvironmental stressors that can occur in a building over time.\nCurrently, the standards and guidelines of IAQ that are in use, mainly address the indoor air and to a\nlesser extent the sources. These include: WHO air quality guidelines [19], ASHRAE [20], EN15251\n[21] and several nationally determined minimum guidelines based on the presence of people only and\ntherefore CO2 concentration. Even though those standards and guidelines are met, the quality of the\nindoor air, as experienced by the occupants, may often still not be acceptable and can cause health and\ncomfort problems. There seems to be a discrepancy between current standards and wishes and\ndemands of end-users [22]. Minimum ventilation rates based mainly on body odour with CO2 as an\nindicator and to some extent on primary emissions from some building materials, are not preventing\noccupants and visitors of a space developing health symptoms (asthma, etc) and\/or comfort complaints\n(e.g. odour, irritation).\nFrom the state of the art review, it was concluded that defining IAQ can be difficult. Considering the\nstatus of our knowledge with respect to emission, indoor air and human perception, it is not surprising\nthat there are considerable difficulties with defining effective standards and guidelines for good indoor\nair quality. it is thus not strange that discussions on how much ventilation is sufficient to prevent\nnoxious odour and spread of disease, that have origins in the beginning of the 19th century [23], are\nstill on-going (see Figure 1).\nSome facts and problems underlying the conclusions of the state of the art review are listed below and\ndescribed elsewhere in more detail [18]:\n- The emission behaviour of sources is complex.\n- Indoor and source surface chemistry create \u201cnew\u201d often unidentified compounds, not (yet)\naccounted for in current standards and guidelines.\n- The material constituents and moisture retention characteristics of a product determine the risk for\nmicrobial growth.\n- The HVAC systems can be a source of pollution as well, if poorly designed, operated and\/or\nmaintained, which is not always acknowledged.\n- To truly evaluate an exposure, all routes of exposure (both physiological and psychological) should\nbe taken into account. Individuals will react differently to the same exposure.\n- There are diverse techniques available to indicate the IAQ people are being or were exposed to.\n6- It is difficult to relate symptoms to IAQ evaluations.\n- Some compounds may have adverse effects on their own, while others, seemingly harmless, but\ncan become harmful when they interact with each other or over time.\n- Some compounds would behave differently and can cause a health effect when in a mixture than\nwhen they exist as individual single compound.\n- Problems with IAQ are not only source related, but also building process related.\nFigure 1. Minimum ventilation rates\nThe recommended minimum ventilation rate has changed over the years: from 2 l\/s per person by\nTredgold in 1836, to 14 l\/s per person by Billings in 1895 [24], back to 4.7 l\/s per person in 1936 by\nYaglou to 7.5 l\/s per person in 1983 [25, 26]. The current recommended minimum ventilation rate by\nASHRAE [20] is 2.5 l\/s per person added with 0.3 l\/s.m2 for single person cellular offices (10 m2) and\n4 l\/s person added with 0.4 l\/s.m2 for single person cellular offices (10 m2) by CEN [21].\nINFORMATION EXCHANGE\nInformation exchange is a key part of this project. The objectives of the information exchange were:\n\uf0b7 To investigate the attitudes of key stakeholders\n\uf0b7 To identify actions required\n\uf0b7 To raise their awareness about IAQ issues.\nIn order to facilitate the information exchange with the stakeholders, the project organised a workshop\nin Rotterdam and interviewed 105 stakeholder organisations. Also a discussion forum was conducted\nat the Healthy Buildings 2009 international conference which was held on 13-17 September 2009 at\nSyracuse in New York, USA. The forum was attended by international experts; including\npractitioners, architects and environmental technologists, as well different sectors of building and\nmaterial industries.\nminimum ventilation rates\n0\n2,5\n5\n7,5\n10\n12,5\n15\n17,5\n20\n1825 1850 1875 1900 1925 1950 1975 2000 2025\nyear\nve\nn\nti\nla\nti\no\nn\nra\nte\n(l\n\/s\np\ner\np\ner\nso\nn\n)\n7Workshop\nThe report of the state of the art review provided the themes for a workshop that was held on\nNovember 21, 2007 in Rotterdam, Netherlands to have a first discussion on the ways to improve\nindoor air quality. Thirty people comprising different stakeholders within the building sector\n(producers of building products, architects, buildings owners, consultants, standardization bodies and\nresearch organisation members), attended the meeting. The programme and the summary of the\nmeeting can be found on the website of HealthyAir [www.healthy-air.org].\nThe issues raised during the discussion are summarised as follows:\n\uf0b7 In order to obtain good IAQ in buildings, it is necessary to select low emission products, but also\nto properly design, operate and maintain ventilation systems. Indoor air quality guidelines, which\ncan be set as objectives to be reached, are also necessary as shown by the experiences\ndemonstrated by initiatives and schemes developed in Finland [39].\n\uf0b7 People in charge of building product selection during building design are generally not aware of\nIAQ issues and do not have smart and simple tools for choosing low emission products. It is\ntherefore necessary to transfer knowledge on IAQ towards people in charge of the design of\nindoor spaces. This should be done through education of all professionals (e.g. architects) and\nother stakeholders in the building sector and also through the development of terms of reference,\nsimple tools and criteria, and technical specifications.\n\uf0b7 While good IAQ is generally not considered as a priority when designing buildings, the building\nsector has integrated the global concept of \u201csustainability\u201d which covers a wide range of issues.\nSeveral workshop participants, including building owners, suggested that IAQ should be closely\nlinked to \u201csustainability\u201d since architects and industry already accept the need for sustainable\nbuildings. This link could have a broader impact than \u201cIAQ only\u201d labels.\n\uf0b7 Energy efficient buildings were regarded as a new challenge for the building sector. The drive to\nincrease energy efficiency will probably lead to drastic changes in building design, to more\ninsulation of the envelope and air-tight buildings, to the introduction of new synthetic materials\nand the reduction of ventilation. Those changes will certainly affect IAQ and therefore source\ncontrol and ventilation optimisation should no longer be ignored otherwise energy efficient\nbuildings will not be \u201chealthy buildings\u201d.\n\uf0b7 Several workshop participants expressed their wish for simple actions to be adopted based on\ncurrent knowledge in order to achieve better IAQ now rather than await the outcome of further\nresearch which may recommend other actions at some undefined time in the future.\n8Interviews\nFurther consultation with different stakeholder groups (architects, producers of construction products\nand end-users represented by housing corporations) were carried out by interviews undertaken in a\nnumber of European countries (The Netherlands, United Kingdom, Denmark, Sweden, France and\nCzech Republic) as well as at European level (see Table 1). A leaflet providing general information\nabout indoor air quality and the HealthyAir project was circulated before the interview.\nTable 1 Interviews per stakeholder group and country.\nInterviews NL UK DK S F CR total\nArchitects 5 5 5 1 5 - 21\nNational umbrella of architects 1 1 1 2 5\nACE 1 1\nHousing corporations 5 5 5 5 5 25\nNational umbrella of housing corporations 1 1\nCECODHAS 1 1\nProduct producers 5 5 5 8 5 7 35\nProduct TCs 5 5\nUmbrella\u2019s of industry (incl.

It also explored current knowledge of interviewees on existing EU and\nnational initiatives on indoor air, and asked about their own policies on sustainable buildings, as well\nas the main current challenges facing their business sector.\nFor the analysis, four groups were identified:\n- Architects: comprising of the individual architects, the national umbrella\u2019s and the Architect\u2019s\nCouncil for Europe (ACE) which is the European umbrella.\n- Housing corporations: comprising of the individual housing corporations, the national umbrella\norganisations and the European Liaison Committee for Social Housing (CECODHAS) which is\nthe European umbrella.\n- Product producers: comprising of individual product manufacturers.\n9- The technical committees (TCs) of the various types of construction products within the\nEuropean Standard Organisation and the umbrellas of industries.\nIn each participating country, for each of those groups, an analysis was carried out and these were\ncombined into a more general summary applicable to all countries. While the sample was relatively\nsmall and therefore not fully representative, the findings are informative (see below).\nArchitects\nIn general, the architects and umbrellas of architects interviewed did not consider IAQ to be a priority\nissue at the moment, except perhaps for schools, although they found IAQ an important parameter in\nthe design process and even more so in the occupational phase of a building. Some architects\nconsidered a combination of the competitive market, the clients wish to minimise costs and the client\u2019s\nlack of awareness about IAQ, discouraging. IAQ is almost everywhere linked to ventilation, and\ntherefore keeping to the regulations for ventilation is the current means of dealing with IAQ.\nLinking IAQ to health, productivity and energy seems a logical way to show why IAQ is important,\nbut another label whether it is on the product or building level is not immediately embraced. Linking\nrequirements relevant for IAQ to sustainability is probably the best option. Several architects made a\nplea to involve, make aware and educate the end-user, since they have an important role in\ndetermining what is brought into the building and how activities are executed. These end-users can be\neducated and stimulated via the press (make it a public issue) but also via the internet, booklets and\nother media. The architects themselves are in need of information and education, because they feel\nthey should know more about IAQ. Some, especially in France, are a step ahead and require emission\ndata for construction products and even a tool with which they can predict IAQ and compare design\nalternatives. A black list of construction products, rather than a white list, is a wish of some. Measures\nto improve IAQ, examples of good practice, even a pilot building with good IAQ, are other types of\ninformation needed.\nThere is a need to demonstrate to architects that by the use of appropriate design measures the indoor\nair quality can be improved. It is very important to show them a diversity of design solutions that\nachieve good IAQ. If there were examples, it could help them to make their own designs special.\nGeneral recommendations from the interviews of architects are presented in textbox 1.\n10\nHousing corporations\nIAQ is in fact IEQ (Indoor Environmental Quality) to the interviewees from housing corporations, and\nshould be linked to energy and comfort. Health should not be influenced negatively by saving energy\nmeasures (tighter buildings). If a label is to be applied, it should be linked to energy and regulation\nmeasures. Tenants are crucial. According to the majority of the interviewed housing corporations the\ntenants are mainly responsible for achieving good IAQ and therefore need to be educated. The press\nparticularly television, and also information available on the Internet could help to promote awareness\nof IEQ issues.\nIn general, for the housing corporations IAQ is considered important but not a key parameter. For\nsome (e.g. in France), requirements on emissions from construction products are seen as a good way to\nraise awareness, while at the same time it was pointed out that the link to health and safety outcomes\nhave not been sufficiently clear. A better understanding of the link to health, safety, comfort and\nproductivity would help to make IAQ more of an issue.\nLinking to sustainability is in general not preferred, while labelling of products is in general preferred\nto the labelling of buildings. Information about IAQ and what can be done to improve IAQ for their\ntenants is wanted because of concern for the comfort of tenants as well as avoidance of possible\nnegative effects on the image of the corporation.\nGeneral recommendations from the interviewees of housing corporations are presented in textbox 2.\nTextbox 1 General recommendations from the interviewed architects\n- Information to educate and to increase awareness of architects, end-users and all others involved in\nthe construction sector: There is a clear lack of information on what is needed to improve IAQ. Work\nshould start by making architects and, certainly the end-users and the clients, aware of the importance\nof IAQ. If one is not aware of what certain measures, products or design options will cause, the problem\nwill never be tackled. Lists of measures, examples of good practice, do\u2019s and don\u2019ts, but moreover the\nbasic information required to estimate\/evaluate what IAQ is or will be, are needed. The press, internet\nand personal instructions seemed to be the favoured means to provide the occupant with information,\nwhile architects themselves are in need of education, perhaps via the national umbrella of architects.\n- Change of design and working practices by including IAQ in the initial design work (briefing) and\ndefining (mandatory or not) performance based requirements: There is a need to change the current way\nof working, in order that it should relate to improving IAQ, but also needs to be integrated to other\nevolving topics such as sustainability, energy, health and comfort. The traditional construction process\nis not functioning optimally, for the afore-mentioned topics. Performance based requirements set at the\ninitiation of a project should form the starting points, and should have the involvement of all\nstakeholders. The question that arises is of course which performance requirements for IAQ should be\ntaken as a starting point and how these relate to measures and design options. Ventilation requirements\nare not enough.\n11\nProduct Producers\nAccording to most of the interviewed product producers, emissions of construction products are not\nthe most important sources that are causing poor IAQ and their own products are definitely not of\nconcern. In general they are of the opinion that their products do not contribute to IAQ problems,\nincluding those that do not have emission data. For most of them it is an issue because of the existing\nlabelling systems and for some because it can be a unique selling point (low-emitting healthier\nproducts). They see labelling of products as the simplest way because labelling of buildings is\ncomplex. But it will only be effective if a product label is mandatory and they would prefer a labelling\nsystem at European level. Most of them are aware of the national and international activities and many\nare involved themselves through trade associations who are active in CEN or the International\nStandards Organisation (ISO). The general recommendations from the interviewed product producers\nare presented in textbox 3.\nProduct Technical committees and umbrellas of industry\nIn general, the interviewees of the TCs and umbrella\u2019s pointed out that IAQ is only one of the safety\naspects of a product. Their products either do not contribute to poor IAQ or have only very small\neffects and there is no benefit in including IAQ awareness in their businesses. Labelling has associated\nemotional issues. They believe that IAQ will be an important issue in the future. Some argued that the\nend-users themselves should ask for good products. Both labelling of products and labelling of\nbuildings are identified as the preference.\nTextbox 3 General recommendations from the interviewed product producers\n- Raise awareness with the general public, but more should focus on how to improve the indoor\nenvironment of a building than how to improve the IAQ via the use of construction products. This\nawareness can be raised by showing the benefits of good IEQ (a clear link with health and comfort) and\nby examples of good solutions\/measures and designs. Again the public should not be made afraid\n(avoid the fear approach) and it is the task of the authorities and experts to provide appropriate\ninformation.\n- Mandatory regulations for IAQ, for products or buildings: Some go a step further and are of the\nopinion that mandatory regulations are the only action that will work. Only then would the product\nproducers themselves take action by testing their own products and developing IAQ friendly products.\nTextbox 2 General recommendations from the interviewees of housing corporations\n- Education and awareness of tenants: it is generally proposed to educate mainly the tenant on how to\nuse their buildings. A resident\u2019s handbook (supported by one-on-one instruction) is a possibility, but it\nis also emphasized that the press (national campaigns) and information on the internet can influence the\ntenant. This influencing should not be based on fear, but a positive angle should be taken. Practical and\nsimple information on how to improve their living situation focusing on their lifestyle (behaviour) is\nrequired.\n- Information needs on IAQ: information related to products in the form of classification and\/or\nlabelling, on benefits and examples of good measures. One could learn from an inventory of actual IAQ\nsituations and by checking whether improvements do have the predicted effect.\n12\nAn IAQ labelling system should be compulsory and easy to understand in order to promote\ndevelopment of low emitting products. If the labelling has a voluntary status, there will be no demand\nfor it. Regulation seems to be the easiest way to promote IAQ. Linking to sustainability is not\nsupported by everyone. Every way of educating people (information transfer) should be used, but\ntransfer via the press and the media is considered to be the most effective. A \u2018fear-approach\u2019 should\nnot be used. National campaigns could help to educate people. There is a need for classification of\nproducts, white lists, examples of good measures, emissions and specialist knowledge from experts.\nOnly some of this is available. The recommendations from the interviewees of the TCs and the\numbrella\u2019s were more or less the same as those from the product producers (see textbox 3).\nConclusions from the Interviews\nFrom the interviews of the three target groups on IAQ and their business related activities, it can be\nconcluded that in general IAQ is not an issue that is actively taken into account. Even though almost\nall acknowledged the importance of IAQ in relation to health and comfort, most do not have a good\ntechnical knowledge as to why it is important. Ventilation is the dominant measure to improve IAQ\nabout which they are aware of, and therefore it is related to the current movement to decrease the use\nof energy.\nEmissions of construction products are not immediately pinpointed as a possible source of poor IAQ.\nThe product producers themselves considered the contribution of their products to be negligible\ncompared to other indoor sources. Only regulation (i.e. labelling of products and\/or buildings) and\ninformation by authorities could change this point of view.\nAs long as their clients of all three target groups are not specifically asking for products and buildings\nthat result in good IAQ, they will not take action, unless it is necessary to protect their image. The\nobjective should be an initiative that provides a win-win situation, preferably with a holistic approach\nthat includes all stakeholders involved.\nForum\nThe session held at the Healthy Buildings 2009 international conference in Syracuse, New York,\nattracted around 50 persons from different countries all over the world. The main question discussed\nwas: How to make the end-users aware of IAQ?\nThere was a common agreement amongst the delegates that education and awareness is an essential\naction for improving indoor air quality. Probably the best approach would involve education of\nchildren at school. They are the future and they will teach their parents. This was seen as appropriate\n13\nfor the awareness of energy use, e.g. use of lighting. If children at school learn to turn off the light\nwhen they leave a room, they will teach their parents at home. It would be also easier to teach children\nthan their parents from a practical point of view as parents, in general, do not have the sufficient\nmotivation to go to educational classes to learn about IAQ or other issues concerning sustainability.\nLinking IAQ to sustainability (e.g. reduction of CO2) could be an effective approach. In fact it was\nmentioned by several attendants, that on a small scale some programmes are being trialled for children\nat school.\nAt political level (EU), IAQ is being recognized as a public health issue. Therefore, according to some\nof the attendants, we should also follow the way of standardization at the European or even global\nlevel, forcing the stakeholders of the built environment to follow \u2018the standard rules\u2019. This would\nrequire concise information from research, presented to the building community in a \u2018digestible\u2019 way.\nThis opinion was not shared by everyone. Information should not be over-simplified in an attempt to\nmake it easier to understand, because this can make the information \u2018useless\u2019. This could be\nsymptomatic of us not yet knowing enough to make that transition from information transfer to a\n\u2018common knowledge\u2019, at a general (i.e. putting things together) or even at a detailed level. Simplicity\nis different from simple and in many ways clearer for people to develop compliance and understand\nthe standard requirements.\nTwo opinions could be extracted from the discussion:\n- The knowledge is in place but needs to be translated into tools that can effectively reach the\nintended audience(s) and enable them to put science into action. The interpretation of that\nknowledge should be interdisciplinary, in order to incorporate results from different sciences and\napproaches, to give a better and more complete picture of the present knowledge.\n- Detailed knowledge and new issues are emerging that need further research and development\nbefore these can be communicated to the public. There is also a need for the conclusions to have a\nmuch broader application linked to a wider context of building environment.\nIt was proposed that there is a need to approach education differently and not just translate technical\nfindings into simple terms. The end users (and their activities) should be targeted and therefore the\napproach to education and awareness activities should take account of their point of view. Bringing\ntogether engineers with behavioural experts on this matter could provide a solution. A suitable\npackage of educational material for the different levels of students would be needed.\nIt was concluded that although different countries have different educational priorities (e.g., school,\nbuilding managers), a \u201cpush & pull\u201d approach, i.e. regulation and education, will probably be the best\nway forward. If the IAQ community (i.e. the scientists, engineers, technologists and regulators) are not\n14\ntaking action, the stakeholders (e.g. architects, product producers and building owners) who can\npotentially do something to improve IAQ will not, because their clients are not requiring them to act\nand ultimately the public will and would not know what to ask for.\nPOSSIBLE APPROACH\nFrom the information gathered in the state of the art review, the workshop, the interviews and the\nforum can be distilled; that the approach required to improve IAQ with a main focus on construction\nproducts should comprise of at least three clearly intertwined levels of actions: education and\nawareness, regulation and policies, and research and development.\nEducation and awareness\nThe general awareness of, \u2018how one can improve IAQ and who should or can undertake action to\nremediate the situation\u2019, is poor, even though most interviewed persons thought that they do have\nsome understanding of the requirements. This awareness can be raised by showing the benefits of\ngood IEQ - by a clear link with health and comfort without causing fear - and by examples of good\nsolutions\/measures and designs. According to most parties, this should be the task of the local\nauthorities of governments and experts to provide appropriate information for education of the public\nand end-users. It is the end-user (client) that would need to be made aware of the IAQ issues, only\nthen will changes occur, that would produce the necessary impact on the other target groups of\nstakeholders.\nIn the HealthyAir project, pathways for improving this awareness have been recommended for four\nstakeholder groups: professionals at university, children at school, practicing architects and tenants\n(see Table 2).\nTable 2 Recommended pathways for improving awareness for four different stakeholder groups.\nPathway 1 Pathway 2\nProfessionals at universities Undergraduate programme Specialised courses\nPractising architects Workshops and meetings Umbrella of architects\nChildren at school Educational programme Management of school\nTenants Housing corporations Media\nProfessionals at universities\nArguably little has changed with regard to the structure of formal education in the indoor air sciences\nat universities since the study by Boschi and others over 10 years ago [27]. Currently, an ISIAQ\n(International Society of Indoor Air Quality and Climate) task force aims to review the education\nrequirements in the indoor air sciences and possibly develop tools for selected end users\n15\n[www.isiaq.org]. Also some particular professional training courses have been developed such as\ndescribed by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation [28] and at international level by NIVA\n(Nordic Institute for Advanced Training in Occupational Health) [www.niva.org] or courses for\nHVAC engineers at national level (e.g. by REVHA (Federation of European HVAC Associations)\nlinked organizations). Initiatives, such as the education and symposium activities on IEQ being\ndeveloped by the International Society of the Built Environment (ISBE) in the UK, China, Hong Kong\nand Korea would also contribute to the promotion of the issues [www.isbeltd.com].\nEducational material is available (for example by Maroni et al. [29] or by Spengler et al. [30], but it\ndoesn\u2019t seem to be widely applied in university education, perhaps because the information is too\ncomplex, too expensive and\/or not appropriate for the particular audience (e.g. limited to a chemical or\nengineering viewpoint). It is notable that no material has been available, until recently (see [31]), that\ncovers indoor environment quality as a whole and considers different points of views.\nIn order to assess the amount of training provided to architects, as one of the important groups of\nprofessionals; a small survey was undertaken by the HealthyAir project of a sample of UK universities\nproviding education of undergraduate and postgraduate. While the information from UK universities\nmay not be broadly representative it does further support the view that the situation with regard to\nformal education in the indoor air sciences may not have changed substantially from that reviewed by\nBoschi [27]. Possibly the most practical method of training architects further about IAQ, at least in the\nshort term, is through an expansion of specialised courses that are recognised for continuing\nprofessional development, next to a solid undergraduate programme. The latter should provide clear\ninformation about indoor environment quality (including indoor air quality) and the effects on comfort\nand performances.\nPractising Architects\nBased on the interviews described before, it seems that practising architects consider IAQ\nsynonymous with ventilation (room volume) and link to energy performance of buildings. Energy\nperformance has been in general, (there are exceptions of course), a higher priority than selection of\nIAQ friendly materials for source control, even though the selection of low-emitting products will\nenable the use of less ventilation and thereby reducing the possible energy requirements of the\nbuilding.\nEnvironmental aspects and environmental performance of building materials have gained attention\nduring recent years. This is seen in the development of environmental product declarations (EPDs) and\nseveral national and international eco-labels, which are used as guides for selection of environmentally\nfriendly products. Although many of the eco-labels are \u2018cradle-to-grave\u2019 or \u2018cradle-to-cradle\u2019 based,\n16\nthe focus is typically not on the impact on IAQ in the \u2018in-use\u2019 phase of the product. At national level,\nsome emission testing is in use and labelling schemes have been developed [6]. Unfortunately, most\narchitects are not aware of the existence of those labelling schemes at national level, and are even less\naware of the international activities on emission testing or harmonisation of labelling schemes.\nArchitects should be addressed through workshops and meetings. Workshops held by an expert at\nindividual architectural practices will most probably have the biggest impact, but would also require\nthe most resources in terms of cost and man power, since a large number of individual arrangements\nhave to be made. Additionally, information distributed in written form, e.g. by the architects umbrella\norganization, in the form of a leaflet, can also be effectively applied.\nChildren at school\nChildren at schools are increasingly the focus of political attention. For example in France, following\nthe Grenelle Environment decisions [32] and the second French environmental health action plan\n[33],] this attention has grown from a few monitoring projects to the concept of permanent monitoring\nof IAQ, starting with kindergartens and primary schools. Parallel to the monitoring activities, research\nis being undertaken with the goal of developing IAQ indices for risk management and in addition\nattention is being given to improving awareness about IAQ via the Internet.\nWith these activities an attempt is being made to prescribe how IAQ should be handled for the\nchildren and their teachers in schools. The question of how to involve and educate children on this\nmatter and what exactly to teach them, however, remains open. The need to educate children exists, as\nwas identified at the Forum held during the Healthy Buildings 2009 conference in Syracuse. In fact,\nthe majority of the attendants thought this would be the best way to proceed. An educational\nprogramme for children, integrated with information on sustainability issues, could begin for children\nat the age of 7 (once they are able to read) or even younger, e.g. by the use of games.\nInitiatives and tools do exist in other countries to help school administrators, facility planners and\neducators to create a safe and healthy learning environment. For example Health Canada has\ndeveloped the \u2018Tools for schools action kit for Canadian schools\u2019 [www.hc-sc.gc.ca\/ewh-\nsemt\/air\/in\/school-ecole\/index-eng.php], which is a practical tool to help schools to understand and\naddress IAQ problems. A custom made information package or handbook for the management of the\nschool comprising of practical and simple information on how to improve the situation focused on the\nbehaviour and activities performed.\nTenants\nThe participants of HealthyAir have produced a rough inventory of the type of information channel or\nmedium used to inform tenants, or the general public about how to take care of their own living\n17\nenvironment in such a way that it is healthy and comfortable. From the participating countries, the\nInternet was identified as a dominant channel at the moment, television in general is only used when\nsomething negative has occurred, for example, carbon monoxide poisoning and exposure to asbestos\nand fine dust. Information leaflets are available from governmental organisations but these are not\nactively promoted. However, the information presented often assumes a certain knowledge level of the\nreaders or listeners and, sometimes, can be too technical or is not explained well enough why certain\nthings happened or are required. Although the fear approach is not recommended; realistic\ninformation, either positive or negative, would still need to be communicated to the end-users or\ngeneral public.\nThe information that can be transferred via the housing corporation can comprise for example; a\nresident\u2019s handbook, including practical and simple information on how to improve their living\nsituation by focusing on their behaviour and lifestyle linked to an existing evaluation system; or by\nnewsletters or domestic TV information channel.\nPossibilities to make tenants or the general public, aware via the media include a film, public\nmeetings, newspaper and magazine articles, a leaflet series or perhaps a book (even though many of\nthe interviewees were against this) on how your health can be affected by an unhealthy living\nenvironment. For the latter some examples are available at national level (in the Netherlands: [34]; in\nGermany: [35]; in the UK: [36]). A film or television commercial presentation can influence the\npublic. Examples are public awareness campaigns on ventilation in The Netherlands and in France\n[http:\/\/www.air-interieur.org\/oqai,aspx] and the CO awareness week in the UK to highlight risks of\ncarbon monoxide poisoning [http:\/\/www.covictim.org].\nRegulations and policies\nWith respect to policies, the European project EnVIE [www.envie-iaq.eu] produced a list of\nrecommendations on policies with regard to IAQ linked to the following:\n- Energy efficiency, building materials, products and maintenance\n- The impacts of the outdoor environment\n- Specific building constructions and equipment.\nFrom the regulatory point of view, several ways to control the effects or possible effects on indoor air\nquality (e.g. exposure to indoor air pollution) are available:\n- Minimum allowable emission rates of pollutants from a source (supported by product labelling).\n- Ban the use of certain pollutants in products (e.g. asbestos, smoking, certain biocidal products,\netc.).\n- A minimum required ventilation rate.\n18\n- A maximum allowable concentration level (exposure level), for example for formaldehyde.\n- Preventive measures such as design approaches (correct design), maintenance activities to prevent\ngrowth of Legionella or strict procedures of intended use of a space or product.\nThe first two measures focus on the source control, while the third and fourth are dealing with the indoor\nair management. The last one deals with a combination of sources, indoor air management and human\nactivities.\nRegulations on maximum allowable concentrations are valid if a clear relationship has been established\nbetween the compound regulated and a health effect. In practice it is difficult to check compliance with\nthese regulations because at present it is not technically and economically feasible to measure pollutants\nin homes on a regular basis, except perhaps for humidity and elevated levels of carbon monoxide. It is\nfurther complicated because the concentration as well as the types of indoor air pollutants may vary\nwidely as a function of both time and space. Also access to homes for measurement would require the\npermission of the householders and this may not be forthcoming. One possible limited approach is the\nmeasurement of IAQ criteria in newly built homes prior to occupation, perhaps in combination with\ntesting of air tightness of the structure [37]. Regulations of products that could possibly emit compounds\nof concern are potentially an effective approach with benefits to occupants of both new and existing\nbuildings, especially for compounds that are identified as carcinogenic. In fact, when a compound has\nbeen clearly identified as being carcinogenic it should be appropriately controlled (e.g. the banning of\nasbestos and limits provided on the release of formaldehyde from products used indoors).\nAfter the realisation that occupants are not the only polluters in indoor environments [5] and therefore\na ventilation rate based on carbon dioxide production of occupants is no longer valid for buildings, and\ndefining the correct ventilation rate has become even more complex. Nevertheless, a minimum\nventilation rate to dilute pollutant concentrations should always be required. This minimum ventilation\nrate should not only be based on the presence of occupants, but should include a certain rate per square\nmeter of surface area of a space [20, 21]. Even though materials are selected based on their minimum\nemission rates, however, some emission will still take place, whether it is primary or secondary\nemissions. It should be noted that regulating only based on ventilation is not enough! On top of that\nregulation should require checking of performance, for example, to ensure that the rate of air removed by\nthe installed extract fan or air supplied by HVAC meets the design values [38].\nLabelling of products or buildings is a regulatory option including several of the measures presented\nabove. Nevertheless mandatory requirements on emissions from building products are relatively\nscarce in the EU, most of existing product labelling schemes are voluntary. In the framework of the\nEU Construction Products Directive, there is an ongoing initiative to establish a harmonised method\n19\nfor the characterization of emissions from building products and components by CEN TC 351 and of\nenvironmental performance of products and buildings linked to sustainability being developed by\nCEN TC 350. The question arises as to whether the intended target stakeholder groups will use the\nlabels. If mandatory, the labels will of course have to be used but the system applied must fulfil the\npurpose for improving indoor air quality. In addition, harmonisation of the most relevant existing\nvoluntary schemes in Denmark, Finland, Germany and France would broaden their individual\nacceptance and relevance and encourage a greater use of labelled products and the development of\nnew products, which meet the appropriate emissions criteria.\nLabelling at the product level, would at least ascertain that the total emissions of products will be\nreduced and therefore the total amount of substances emitted to the air, will decrease. The Finnish\nexperience with the M1 label has shown that this can work to a certain extent [39]. In the absence of a\n\u201ccomplete picture\u201d of the effects of the wide range of substances emitted the pragmatic approach\nwould be to reduce exposure by controlling the sources of emissions.\nThe building environmental assessment methods such as BREEAM in the UK, LEED in the USA,\nCASBEE in Japan [www.ibec.or.jp], Green Globes in Canada [www.greenglobes.com], and\napproaches of ISO [40, 41] and CEN [42] linked to sustainability do not currently include the detailed\ninformation that is required to identify the sources of pollutants encountered in the indoor air. These\ntypes of schemes provide an assessment of a wide range of sustainability issues but do not guarantee\nprovision of good IAQ. Also they do not provide a process to remediate or replace buildings with poor\nindoor air quality. Thus although it may be possible for regulators to monitor trends in sustainability\nissues on a national level it does not guarantee the individual end-user, a healthy building. Any such\nassessment tool applied at the time of construction and refurbishment would not take account of the\ninfluence of occupants\u2019 activities in the indoor environment and also changes occurring outdoors such\nas increased traffic or refurbishment in the vicinity.\nMost interviewed parties agreed that some kind of regulation is required to compel action, whether\nthis is at the product level (labelling of products) or at the building level such as the building\nenvironmental assessment methods. To link or merge this regulation with sustainability is the most\npreferred option, which would most likely increase awareness. Finding a way to incorporate the first\nstep for improving IAQ, Source control, should therefore be investigated.\nResearch and development\nIt is clear from the state of the art review that regulations based on IAQ threshold levels are very\ndifficult to formulate because of a lack of knowledge at several levels: the behaviour of the sources,\n20\nthe air chemistry and lastly but certainly not least, the human beings that receive or take up the\npollutants.\nFor a long time now, IAQ has been mainly approached from the indoor air point of view by measuring\nall compounds present and to try to define an appropriate ventilation rate for an indoor situation.\nBecause we know now that starting with the content of the air would not lead to a satisfying solution\nin the near future, other points of views would also need to be investigated more closely: i.e. the\nsource and the receiver. Currently, a lot of attention is being given to source control and the\nmechanisms occurring at a particular source and in the air with the evolving knowledge on primary\nand secondary pollutants. But the fact remains that we still do not have the complete picture to pin-\npoint which pollutants or mixtures of pollutants, are responsible for which health effects and where\nthose pollutants are originating from. This is partly related to our lack of knowledge on how these\nhealth effects may occur and how to measure them in relation to the pollutants over time under\ndifferent environmental conditions. It is important to acknowledge that:\n\uf0b7 Individual differences, emotions, context and time are important parameters.\n\uf0b7 Most likely, a multidisciplinary approach is required to improve the understanding of the\nmechanisms taking place at the source and receiver, and also on \u201con the way\u201d mechanisms.\n\uf0b7 Positive and negative effects of stimuli should be included as well as interactions with other\naspects of the indoor environment.\n\uf0b7 The human body responds in different ways led by physical, chemical, physiological and\npsychological processes.\n\uf0b7 The current applied indicators are most likely not sufficient to explain the outcome of those\nprocesses [43].\nParallel to the research in depth on the mechanisms behind the physical, chemical, physiological and\npsychological processes, another approach towards IAQ is needed. This requires an increased\nunderstanding of how the human body receives, perceives and responds to certain environmental\nconditions. To study these responses with the human being as the ultimate sensor should be an\nimportant direction for the future, taking into account the different exposure routes such as the\nolfactory neuronal pathway [44], as well as individual differences, context and time.\nIn addition, we need to reconsider our risk models: to focus on real exposure situations rather than\nsingle components, parameters or pollutants in a laboratory (see Figure 2). Multi-exposure effects can\nonly then, be identified.\nFigure 2 Another approach towards IAQ: exposure situations rather than single components?\nCONCLUSIONS\nFrom the various activities undertaken in the HealthyAir project including the\nthe workshop in Rotterdam, the\nHealthy Buildings forum, it is clear that in order to improve\nbe evaluated.\nEducation and awareness using a\nrealise the importance of IAQ, ranging from educating school children applying new ways (perhaps a\ncomputer based games) to educating building professionals and practising architects with hands\nexamples of best practices.\nAt the same time, regulation and policies for IAQ should be intertwined or at least linked to\nsustainability and health issues. And lastly but not the least, research and development should focus on\nmulti-exposure situations rather than single c\nultimate sensor. A multi-disciplinary approach is therefore required to achieve the necessary actions\nfor improving IAQ and for managing future risks to IAQ such as the possible implications of climate\nchange.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nHealthyAir is partly sponsored by the European Union in the Public Health programme (2003\nunder the management of Mrs Paloma Martin of the Executive agency for Health and Consumers\n(EAHC).
