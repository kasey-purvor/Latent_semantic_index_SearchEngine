Of the 31 total cpDNA haplotypes identified, 16 \noccurred in Central America and 15 in Amazonia with no single haplotype shared \nbetween the two regions.

Swietenia macrophylla has a wide geographic range from \nMexico through Central America and across the southern arc of the Amazon basin in \nBolivia and Brazil (Lamb, 1966; Pennington, 1981). The species has wide ecological \ntolerance and occurs in a variety of habitats from wet to seasonally dry, evergreen to \ndeciduous, tropical to subtropical forests, with typically 800 - 2,500 mm of annual \nrainfall and at altitudes ranging from sea level to 1,400 m (Lamb, 1966; Whitmore, \n1983). However, the species reaches its optimum natural development in Holdridge\u2019s \n(1971) tropical dry forest formation (Lamb, 1966). Mahogany tends to occur in widely \nscattered patches and its density within patches is typically less than one commercial-\nsize tree per hectare (Whitmore, 1983; Verissimo et al., 1995). This patchy distribution \nis probably related to its mode of regeneration that requires major disturbances such as \nriver course changes, hurricanes, blowdowns, and fire (Snook, 1996). In these \nsituations, stands may be comprised of one or a few cohorts (Grogan et al., 2003). \nSwietenia macrophylla has been exploited throughout its natural range since the \nbeginning of the 20th century (Lamb, 1966; Rodan et al., 1992). In recent decades, with \nthe depletion of natural stands in Central America, most of the extraction has come from \npopulations in South America, especially in the Brazilian Amazon. Mahogany \nextraction is based on selective logging, which usually removes only the tallest trees of \ngood form and with a dbh (diameter at breast height) > 80 cm (Verissimo et al., 1995; \n 4\nGullison et al., 1996). In addition to removing the most fecund trees, selective logging \nmay have a significant impact on genetic structure and population size, and compromise \nthe evolutionary viability of natural mahogany populations (Cornelius et al., 2005). The \ninclusion of S. macrophylla in CITES Appendix II in 2002 aimed to control \ninternational trade by ensuring that logging will not be detrimental to the survival of the \nspecies (Grogan and Barreto, 2005).  \n93 \n94 \n95 \n96 \n97 \n98 \n99 \n100 \n101 \n102 \n103 \n104 \n105 \n106 \n107 \n108 \n109 \n110 \n111 \n112 \n113 \n114 \n115 \n116 \n117 \nStudies of the organization of genetic diversity of S. macrophylla have been \ncarried out in the Brazilian Amazonia (Lemes et. al., 2003) and in Central America \n(Novick et al. 2003) using nuclear microsatellite DNA markers. The studies sampled \npopulations across a similar spatial scale (ca. 1600 km in Central America; 2103 km in \nAmazonia) using seven loci in common. Both studies showed significant isolation by \ndistance patterns, and moderate levels of population differentiation (RST ). Furthermore, \nthe Central American populations exhibited significantly lower mean genetic diversity \nthan the Amazonian populations, which Novick et al. (2003) suggested may have \nresulted from the smaller, more dissected nature of suitable habitat in Central America, \ncombined with more severe vegetation changes during the glacial phases of the \nPleistocene. \nA phylogeographic approach based on chloroplast genome (cpDNA) variation \ncan provide additional insight into the historical patterns of genetic divergence across \nthe range of S. macrophylla. Chloroplast DNA is a haploid genome and is maternally \ninherited in the majority of the angiosperms (Birky, 1995; McCauley 1995; Ennos et al \n1999). Because of its four-fold smaller effective population size, chloroplast markers \ncan often detect geographic structure that is not apparent in nuclear DNA markers \n(Cavers et al., 2003; Petit, 2005). Unfortunately the relatively low rates of nucleotide \nsubstitution in the chloroplast genome (Wolfe et al., 1987) have often impeded its use in \n 5\nphylogeographic studies (Schaal, 1998). However, highly variable mononucleotide \nrepeat loci in the chloroplast genome (cpDNA microsatellites or simple sequence \nrepeats [cpSSRs]) have provided a rich source of variation for studies of \nphylogeography and gene flow (Provan et al., 2001). \n118 \n119 \n120 \n121 \n122 \n123 \n124 \n125 \n126 \n127 \n128 \n129 \n130 \n131 \n132 \n133 \n134 \n135 \n136 \n137 \n138 \n139 \n140 \n141 \n142 \nIn addition to its utility for phylogeographic studies, conservation and \nmanagement purposes, cpSSRs may be useful as regionally distinct cpDNA barcodes \nthat could permit forensic verification of timber origins (Deguilloux  et al., 2002; Dick \nand Kress, 2009). Here we report on the phylogeographic structure of S. macrophylla \npopulations sampled in Central America (Novick et al. 2003) and Amazonia (Lemes et \nal. 2003) based on cpDNA microsatellites. The main aims of the study were: (1) to \nevaluate the utility of chloroplast microsatellite loci for assessing intraspecific variation \nin S. macrophylla; (2) to quantify and compare the organization of genetic diversity of \nS. macrophylla populations in Central America and Amazonia ; and (3) to determine if \npopulation-specific cpDNA haplotypes are credible as regional DNA barcodes for \nmonitoring timber harvests. \n \nRESULTS \nGenetic Variation \nSix out of 10 cpSSR loci initially assayed using universal primers (Weising and \nGardner, 1999) successfully amplified and were found to be polymorphic. All \nindividuals (n = 245) from eight Central American and eight Amazonian populations \nwere analyzed for these six polymorphic cpSSR loci (ccmp 2, ccmp 3, ccmp 4, ccmp 5, \nccmp 7, ccmp 10).  \nA total of 31 different haplotypes and 30 cpSSR alleles were found. The \ncomposition of the haplotypes and their distribution in the populations are given in \n 6\nTable 1. The number of size variants (alleles) per locus varied from three to six. Gene \ndiversity indices (HE) showed a high range of variation across populations (0.000 to \n0.925) (Table 2). \n143 \n144 \n145 \n146 \n147 \n148 \n149 \n150 \n151 \n152 \n153 \n154 \n155 \n156 \n157 \n158 \n159 \n160 \n161 \n162 \n163 \n164 \n165 \n166 \n167 \n \nStructuring and geographical distribution of haplotypes \nThe hierarchical analysis of genetic variation within and among populations performed \nfor each geographical region (Amazonia and Central America) showed contrasting \npatterns.  Most of the variation found in Amazonia was partitioned among populations \n(91%), while in Central America most variation was partitioned within populations \n(64%, Table 3). \nThe pattern of cpSSR haplotype organization provides evidence of a strong \nphylogeographic break between S. macrophylla populations in Central America and \nAmazonia. Of the 31 haplotypes detected, 15 occurred exclusively in Amazonian \npopulations and the remaining 16 in Central America (Table 2), with no single \nhaplotype shared between the two geographical regions. A maximum parsimony \nmedian-joining network (Figure 1), based on the 31 cpDNA haplotypes, exhibited a sole \nmedian vector and a total of 69 mutations, 38 of which occurred along the long branch \nseparating the Central American and Amazonian haplotype clusters. The median vector \nconnected the single Boca do Acre haplotype 17 with the other Amazonian haplotypes. \nHaplotype 17 was separated by 19 mutations from the closest Central American \nhaplotype from Panama (haplotype 7). The long branch between the Central American \nand Amazonian clusters is further evidence of a deep phylogeographic break. \nThe organization of haplotype diversity within the two geographical regions also \ndiffered.  The populations from Central America exhibited a relatively low level of \ndifferentiation (FST = 0.36) compared to Amazonian populations (FST = 0.91) but \n 7\ngenetic diversity of populations was generally high (HE ranging from 0.233 to 0.857).  \nSome common haplotypes were shared among distantly separated Central American \npopulations. For example, haplotypes 4 and 5 were sampled in all eight Central \nAmerican populations. Haplotype 3, exhibited by 21 individuals and closely related to \nhaplotype 4, was also widespread, occurring in four populations. These three widely \ndistributed haplotypes represented 60% of the individuals sampled in Central America. \nDespite the generally weak genetic structure observed in Central American populations, \nhaplotypes 9-16 formed a cluster comprised of individuals from the Pacific region of \nPanama, Costa Rica, and Guatemala, and a few individuals from a north-central Costa \nRican population (El Parque).   \n168 \n169 \n170 \n171 \n172 \n173 \n174 \n175 \n176 \n177 \n178 \n179 \n180 \n181 \n182 \n183 \n184 \n185 \n186 \n187 \n188 \n189 \n190 \n191 \n192 \nConsistent with its higher level of population differentiation (FST = 0.91), there \nwere few widespread haplotypes in Amazonia. The most common and widely \ndistributed haplotype 28 was sampled in three adjacent populations (Pimenta Bueno, \nCahoeira Parecis E, Resex Chico Mendes). Four Amazonian populations were fixed for \none haplotype and three other populations exhibited only two haplotypes. Haplotype \ndiversity within populations was relatively low (mean HE = 0.176), with the exception \nof Marajoara, which contained nine haplotypes among the sixteen individuals sampled \n(HE  = 0.925). One of haplotypes found in Marajoara was shared with neighboring Agua \nAzul, located 107 Km to the north. Populations from the western Amazon tended to \ncluster genetically, except for Boca do Acre, which was relatively isolated in the \nnetwork and clustered with eastern rather than western populations. Haplotypes from \nsouthernmost Amazonian population (Pontes e Lacerda) tended to occupy network tips. \nSpatial analysis of molecular variance (SAMOVA) indicated the most likely \npresence of five genetic groups (FCT = 0.24, P<0.05). Under all values of K, Central \nAmerican populations grouped together. With K = 5, the populations grouped as \n 8\nfollows: 1 \u2013 Central American populations, 2 - Boca do Acre, 3 - Marajoara, Agua \nAzul, 4 - Pontes e Lacerda, 5 - Cachoeira Parecis A, Cachoeira Parecis E, Resex Chico \nMendes, Pimenta Bueno (Figures 1 and 2). These haplotype-defined genetic groups \ntended to cluster the most geographically proximate populations with the exception of \nResex Chico Mendes, which grouped with the populations at Cachoeira Parecis and \nPimenta Bueno rather than the closer Boca do Acre. \n193 \n194 \n195 \n196 \n197 \n198 \n199 \n200 \n201 \n202 \n203 \n204 \n205 \n206 \n207 \n208 \n209 \n210 \n211 \n212 \n213 \n214 \n215 \n216 \n217 \n \nDISCUSSION \n \nThe cpSSR haplotype data revealed a strong phylogeographic break between S. \nmacrophylla in Central America and Amazonia. Similarly large phylogeographic breaks \nbetween cis- and trans-Andean populations have been reported for other rain forest tree \nspecies (e.g. Dick et al. 2003; Dick and Heuertz 2008; Hardesty et al this issue). There \nwere also notable differences in the distribution of cpDNA variation within Central \nAmerica and Amazonia. Central American populations harboured widespread \nhaplotypes that occurred from Mexico to Panama. The Amazonian haplotypes, on the \nother hand, were more localized and most cpDNA variation was partitioned among \npopulations. This pattern is not likely to be explained by sampling effects, since the \nsample sizes in Brazil were consistently high (>16 individuals per population) where \ndifferentiation was also the highest.  \nOur results showed some inconsistency with the nuclear SSR (nSSR) analyses of \nLemes et al. (2003) and Novick et al. (2003). The nSSR data from Central America \nshowed phylogeographic structure in the form of high levels of differentiation (RST) \nacross geographic barriers (Novick et al., 2003). Central American populations also had \nrelatively low allelic richness per locus (mean 13 alleles\/locus) compared to the \n 9\nAmazonian populations (mean of 18 alleles\/locus). In contrast, there was no discernible \nphylogeographic structure in the Central American cpSSR data and the haplotype \ndiversity (16 haplotypes) was similar to levels found in the Brazilian Amazonia (15 \nhaplotypes). Some of the discrepancy between these results may be explained by \ndifferences between the nuclear and chloroplast genomes. First, genetic drift is expected \nto act more strongly on the chloroplast because of its fourfold lower effective \npopulation size. Furthermore, the cpDNA results reflect the sorting of a single genetic \nlocus, whereas the nSSR results were summed over seven nSSR loci and thus provide \nseveral independent estimates of population genetic structure.  \n218 \n219 \n220 \n221 \n222 \n223 \n224 \n225 \n226 \n227 \n228 \n229 \n230 \n231 \n232 \n233 \n234 \n235 \n236 \n237 \n238 \n239 \n240 \n241 \n242 \nGeographic structuring of the cpSSR haplotypes does not appear to correspond \nwith contemporary climatic or altitudinal barriers in Central America. The occurrence of \nwidespread cpDNA haplotypes across Central America strongly implies a role of long \ndistance dispersal and suggests that mountains have not been effective barriers to \nmahogany seed dispersal here. Hurricanes, which are frequent in Central America, can \ncarry the winged seeds of mahogany over long distances and the accompanying wind \nthrows are thought to play an important role in mahogany dispersal and establishment in \nthis region (Snook 1996), which would lead to the present-day haplotype distribution. In \nthe Amazon basin, on the other hand, hurricanes are absent or very rare.  \nOn the other hand, topography may provide physical and climatic barriers for \npollinator movements, as suggested by the significant divergence among Central \nAmerican populations across geographical barriers found by Novick et al. (2003) using \nnSSR markers. Similarly, the divergences among three close populations from different \nvalleys of the Parecis mountains in west-central Brazil, studied by Lemes et al. (2003) \nusing nSSRs, were also highly significant, although these populations belong to the \nsame cpSSR haplotype genetic group (group 5) in the present study.  \n 10\nA non-exclusive alternative explanation for to the observed phylogeographic \nstructure in Central America is the severity of the impact of Pleistocene glaciations \n(Whitmore and Prance, 1987) coupled with the relatively small areas of suitable habitat \nfor mahogany establishment. The reconstructed vegetation of lowland Central America \nbetween 20,000 and 10,500 B.P. (Piperno and Pearsall, 1998) showed restricted areas \nwith moist and dry forests and widespread thorn woodlands, low scrub, and wooded \nsavanna vegetation in the region. These factors are expected to have caused local \nextinctions and much more dramatic reduction in effective population size for Central \nAmerican than for Amazonian mahogany populations (Novick et al. 2003). Under this \nscenario, any ancient signal of structuring and diversification would have been modified \nby Pleistocene vegetation changes. Thus, the current pattern of genetic variation may \nreflect only the most recent geographic expansion of a few founder haplotypes from a \nlimited refugial source and the subsequent formation of newly derived haplotypes. It is \nworth noting the occurrence of a few rare and highly differentiated lineages (e.g. \nhaplotypes 6 and 16) in Central America that may be a relict of the ancestral \npolymorphism.  \n243 \n244 \n245 \n246 \n247 \n248 \n249 \n250 \n251 \n252 \n253 \n254 \n255 \n256 \n257 \n258 \n259 \n260 \n261 \n262 \n263 \n264 \n265 \n266 \nThe significantly lower number of nuclear microsatellite alleles and lower \nheterozygosity in Central American (Novick et al., 2003) than Amazonian populations \n(Lemes et al., 2003) suggests either a more recent geographic expansion, or lower \neffective population sizes in the more topographically dissected Central American \nregion. Mating system analysis has shown that mahogany is somewhat tolerant of \nselfing (Lemes et al., 2007) and the lower nuclear microsatellite diversity in Central \nAmerica may be influenced by ecological pressures favoring inbreeding in individuals \ncolonizing new areas in this region. \n 11\nIn addition to the impacts of the Pleistocene glaciations, Holocene events may \nhave contributed to the current phylogeographic pattern observed for mahogany in \nCentral America. For at least 1500 years before European conquest, tens of millions of \nPre-Columbian agriculturalists practiced shifting agriculture, cultivating maize and \nother light-demanding crops in this region (Denevan 1992). Notably, four of our sample \nsites (sites A-D) are in what was the most highly populated core Mayan zone of \ninfluence where several loosely associated city-states coexisted and rapid forest \nclearance began about 2800 B.P. (Hodell et al.2000, Islebe et al. 1996). As a result of \nthe intensive land use by these dense sedentary agrarian communities, Central America \nwas probably covered, at the time of the European first arrival, by a mosaic of crop \nlands and abandoned fields with secondary vegetation at different successional stages.  \nDespite the death of adult trees caused by forest clearances, this type of anthropogenic \nlandscape will likely have enhanced dispersal of mahogany, a long-lived pioneer tree \n(Grogan et al. 2003), over the region. With the population decline accompanying the \ncollapse of the Classic Mayan society between A.D. 800 and 900 (Hodell et al. 1995) \nand the demographic collapse experienced by Amerindian populations after European \ncontact (Denevan 1992), human pressures were strongly curtailed and most of the \nfragmented landscape in Central America was abandoned . The subsequent large-scale \nforest regeneration (Nevle and Bird 2008) would also have accelerated the expansion of \nthe remnant mahogany lineages in this region.  \n267 \n268 \n269 \n270 \n271 \n272 \n273 \n274 \n275 \n276 \n277 \n278 \n279 \n280 \n281 \n282 \n283 \n284 \n285 \n286 \n287 \n288 \n289 \n290 \n291 \nCpSSR variation in the peripheral Amazon basin exhibited a comparatively \nstronger phylogeographic structure than in Central America. Most of the Amazonian \npopulations were fixed for one haplotype, or exhibited only a few related haplotypes. \nSpatial analysis indicates that there is significant within-region structuring in South \nAmerica, primarily reflecting geographic proximity. The exception to this general \n 12\npattern is the clustering of \u2018Resex Chico Mendes\u2019 with Rondonian populations rather \nthan the more proximate \u2018Boca do Acre\u2019. These two populations, 200 km apart and \nhaving the Juru\u00e1 River as the sole geographical barrier between them, were probably \nderived from separate lineages. Resex Chico Mendes, located in the transitional zone \nbetween the Brazilian Shield and the Tertiary deposits of the Amazon basin was likely \nformed by lineages coming from the relict populations in the Serra dos Parecis \nmountains. Boca do Acre, located at the north-western limit of the species distribution \nin Brazil, seems to be more genetically related to populations from eastern Amazonia. \n292 \n293 \n294 \n295 \n296 \n297 \n298 \n299 \n300 \n301 \n302 \n303 \n304 \n305 \n306 \n307 \n308 \n309 \n310 \n311 \n312 \n313 \n314 \n315 \n316 \nIt seems most likely that cycles of demographic expansion followed by \npopulation bottlenecks and isolation have shaped the phylogeographic pattern in the \nregion. Clearly, there has been a distinctly different demographic history in Amazonia \ncompared with Central America, with an older colonization suggested by longer branch \nlengths and a higher level of geographic isolation for the Amazonian populations as \nindicated by higher FST. \nThe current distribution of mahogany in the Amazonia is characterized by \naggregations of trees in deciduous and semi-deciduous forests along an arc following \nthe southern boundary of the basin (Grogan, 2001; Grogan et al., 2002). These \nseasonally dry forests are areas of \u201cecological tension\u201d between the Amazonian and \nCerrado biomes and are bounded by the evergreen rain forests to the north and by \nsavannas to the south. Seasonally dry forests, which provide optimum habitat for \nmahogany, probably expanded during the cool and dry glacial intervals (Pennington et \nal. 2000; Bush and Silman, 2004; Bush and Oliveira, 2006; Colinvaux  et al. 1996, \n2001) and mahogany population sizes would have been correspondingly larger and \npossibly more continuous in some areas. During the wetter and warmer Holocene, \nrainforests expanded south and eastwards replacing the deciduous forests and savannas \n 13\nin the Amazonian lowlands and in the foothills of the Brazilian Shield.  Thus, it is \npossible that the retraction and isolation of mahogany populations since the end of the \nLast Glacial Maximum and the lack of long distance seed dispersal among the \nremaining mahogany aggregations have influenced phylogeographic structure in the \nBrazilian Amazon.  \n317 \n318 \n319 \n320 \n321 \n322 \n323 \n324 \n325 \n326 \n327 \n328 \n329 \n330 \n331 \n332 \n333 \n334 \n335 \n336 \n337 \n338 \n339 \n340 \n341 \nThe high level of private haplotype diversity found in the Marajoara population, \nin contrast to other Amazonian populations, suggests additional intricacy to the pattern. \nOne possible explanation concerns the stability of a dry and seasonal climate in this \nregion, even during interglacial periods. Marajoara is located on the SW border of the \ndry transverse corridor that crosses central Amazonia in a NW-SE direction, separating \nhumid upper and lower Amazonia (Haffer, 2008). The private haplotype diversity of the \nMarajoara population may be explained by the greater size and stability of the dry \nforests in this area, which could have led to the accumulation and maintenance of \ncpSSR diversity.  \nThe Pre-Columbian cultivation practices in Amazonia also changed the \nenvironment in different ways especially along of the headwater basins of the main \nrivers coming from the northern flanks of the Brazilian Shield (Heckenberger et al. \n2007). This region is dominated by semi-deciduous forests and represents the natural \narea of distribution of S. macrophylla in the Brazilian and Bolivian Amazon. Several \nsmall to medium-sized complex societies flourished in this broad region with \nagricultural and parkland landscapes occurring around villages (Heckenberger et al. \n2003, Erickson 2006). However, the lower Amerindian density, the large distances \nbetween the main settlements, the prevalence of a hunter-gatherer subsistence strategy \nin many groups, and the management of the landscape using agricultural systems that \ndid not require intensive forest clearance (Denevan, 2001, Bal\u00e9e 2006) suggest that the \n 14\nimpact of anthropogenic disturbance in the southern Amazon during the Late Holocene \nwas likely smaller than in Central America. One would expect that there were \nproportionally fewer anthropogenically-altered habitats available for mahogany \ncolonisation in the Amazon basin than in Central America during Pre-Columbian times. \nThus the present-day haplotype distribution in Amazonian mahogany appears to have \nbeen most likely shaped by Pleistocene events.  \n342 \n343 \n344 \n345 \n346 \n347 \n348 \n349 \n350 \n351 \n352 \n353 \n354 \n355 \n356 \n357 \n358 \n359 \n360 \n361 \n362 \n363 \n364 \n365 \n366 \nIn addition to providing genetic evidence of regional demographic history, our \nstudy should also be useful for genetic conservation and management. In mahogany, \nimportant traits such as resistance to shoot borers, growth rate and degree of branching \nshow heritable variation (Newton et al., 1999). The deep phylogeographic break \nbetween Central and South American mahogany populations suggests that there may be \nmajor genomic differences between these sources of mahogany. While the major \nprovenance trials for mahogany (CATIE, Turrialba, Costa Rica) contain only Central \nAmerican samples, our study strongly suggests that Central and South American \nprovenances should be jointly studied for silviculture programs. \nThe findings also have relevance for the conservation of natural mahogany \npopulations. Recent advances in DNA extraction technology permit genotyping of DNA \nfrom dried timber samples (Deguilloux et al., 2002). Using a DNA barcoding approach, \nit is possible to determine the species origin of tropical timbers. However, standard \nplant DNA barcodes often display little variation among closely related species, let \nalone between populations within a species (Dick and Kress, 2009), making it difficult \nto determine the provenance of timber, which is essential in order to monitor illegal \nlogging activities. Our study demonstrates that combinations of cpSSR loci can provide \ndistinct regional cpDNA haplotypes for mahogany. With the six cpSSR loci in this \npopulation, it was possible to definitively assign samples to either Central American or \n 15\nSouth American provenances. With more loci, it should be possible to provide distinct \ngenotypes at finer geographic scales. These DNA barcode approaches should be \nespecially useful in the Amazon basin, which displays the highest level of cpDNA \nphylogeographic structure, and which contains the largest commercial and protected \ntracts of mahogany.  \n367 \n368 \n369 \n370 \n371 \n372 \n373 \n374 \n375 \n376 \n377 \n378 \n379 \n380 \n381 \n382 \n383 \n384 \n385 \n386 \n387 \n388 \n389 \n390 \n391 \nIn summary, our data have highlighted a strong phylogeographic break and an \nintriguing contrast between Amazonian and Central American mahogany populations in \nterms of phylogeographic structure. In order to clarify the occurrence of points of \nhistorical dispersal between the two geographical regions, more extensive sampling in \nSouth America is needed, particularly from the Peruvian, Ecuadorian, Colombian and \nVenezuelan Amazon. Based on the data available so far we suggest that differences in \nglacial history for Central America and Amazonia may have been a key factor in \ndetermining these very divergent patterns. Differences in terms of duration and intensity \nof anthropogenic disturbance between the two regions during the late Holocene may \nhave also affected the vegetation history and played an important role in structuring \ncpDNA lineages. In addition, these findings indicate that any in situ conservation \nprogram or germplasm collection initiatives for this valuable and endangered tree \nshould take into consideration the distinct genetic structures shaped by the contrasting \nhistory of the species in these regions. \n \nMETHODS \nStudy sites and collection \nLeaves of 245 plants were collected from eight populations from six countries in \nCentral America and from eight populations spread across 2,100 km in the southern arc \nof the Amazon drainage basin in Brazil (Figure 2). The samples were used in previous \n 16\nnuclear microsatellite analyses of Lemes et al. (2003) and Novick et al. (2003). In \naddition, new leaf material from adult trees was sampled from Boca do Acre in Brazil \n(N = 28). The leaf material came from adult trees from natural populations in Amazonia \nexcept for Cach E and Agua Azul or from progeny arrays for the Central American  \npopulations and Cach E and Agua Azul, in which a single progeny was used as a proxy \nfor an adult tree. Living material from the Central American populations is maintained \nby CATIE in Turrialba, Costa Rica. The leaves were dried in silica gel and stored at -\n20oC until DNA extraction.  \n392 \n393 \n394 \n395 \n396 \n397 \n398 \n399 \n400 \n401 \n402 \n403 \n404 \n405 \n406 \n407 \n408 \n409 \n410 \n411 \n412 \n413 \n414 \n415 \n416 \n \nMicrosatellite analysis \nTotal genomic DNA was extracted using a Fast Prep (Bio101 Corporation) \nfollowing standard CTAB procedure (Doyle and Doyle, 1987) or alternatively using \nPlant DNeasy kits (Qiagen Corporation, Valencia, CA). DNA quantification was \nperformed by comparison with known concentrations of a DNA standard (Lambda \nDNA) in ethidium bromide-stained 1% agarose gels. \nPCR was initially performed using 10 universal angiosperm primers developed \nby Weising & Gardner (1999) for cpSSR analysis in tobacco. Reactions were carried \nout in a total volume of 10 \u00b5l containing 1X PCR buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 \nmM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2), 200 \u00b5M dNTPs, BSA (2.5 mg ml-1), 1.25 \u00b5M of each \nforward and reverse primers, 1 U Taq DNA polymerase and 5.0 ng of genomic DNA \nusing a MJ Research Incorporated PTC 200 thermal cycler under the following \nparameters: (1) initial denaturation at 940C for 4 min; (2) 30 cycles of denaturation at \n940C for 1 min, annealing at primer-specific Tm for 1 min and extension at 720C for 1 \nmin; (3) final extension at 720C for 10 min. PCR products were eletrophoresed on 5% \npolyacrylamide gels in an Applied Biosystem Incorporated (ABI) Prism 377 sequencer \n 17\nand analysed with Genescan and Genotyper softwares (ABI). The cpSSR allele sizes \nwere binned and normalized using AlleloBin software (Idury and Cardon, 1997). \n417 \n418 \n419 \n420 \n421 \n422 \n423 \n424 \n425 \n426 \n427 \n428 \n429 \n430 \n431 \n432 \n433 \n434 \n435 \n436 \n437 \n438 \n439 \n440 \n441 \n442 \n \nData analysis  \nUnique multi-locus combinations of cpSSR alleles (size variants) were \nconsidered as distinct haplotypes. Genetic diversity was estimated for each population \nbased on the number of alleles (A), the number of haplotypes (NH), and gene diversity \nindex (HE, Nei, 1987). Partitioning of genetic variation within and among populations \nwas tested for each geographical region (Amazonia and Central America) separately by \nanalysis of molecular variation (AMOVA; Excoffier et al., 1992) using Arlequin 2.001 \n(Schneider et al., 2001). The significance of the fixation index was tested with 1000 \npermutations. Relationships among the haplotypes were inferred using median-joining \nnetwork analysis (Bandelt et al., 1999) implemented by Network software (Forster et al., \n2000). Spatial structuring of variation at chloroplast loci was examined using \nSAMOVA (Dupanloup et al, 2002), considering values of K (phylogroup number) \nbetween 2 and 10, using 100 initial conditions for each run and the sum of squared size \ndifferences as a measure of molecular distance. \n \nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \n \nThe study was funded by the Brazilian Ministry of Science and Technology (CNPq\/CT-\nAmazonia grant no. 554017\/2006-7 to M.R.L), and the European Commission, \n(SEEDSOURCE project - contract number 003708).
