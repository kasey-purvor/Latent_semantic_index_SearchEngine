This has wide\nreaching implications with respect to the fate of the uni-\nverse, its dominant constituent, and the nature of funda-\nmental physics. Some 70% of the total energy density acts\nlike a dark energy with strongly negative pressure. Sub-\nsequent observations of the cosmic microwave background\n(CMB) power spectrum and of large scale structure give a\nconcordant picture (Bond et al. 2002; Percival et al. 2002;\nSpergel et al. 2003).\nMapping the expansion history of the universe offers a\nway to gain insights into the mysterious dark energy. For\nexample, characterizing its equation of state (pressure to\nenergy density ratio) behavior gives insight on the prop-\nerties of the high energy physics scalar field potential. Dis-\ntance measures, notably the supernova method, have proved\nadept at beginning to constrain the energy density and equa-\ntion of state of the dark energy. Recent limits, combined\nwith CMB or large scale structure information, within the\nlow redshift approximation of a constant equation of state\n\u22c6 E-mail: EVLinder@lbl.gov; A.R.Jenkins@durham.ac.uk\n(EOS) ratio w, give \u22121.61 < w < \u22120.78 at 95% confidence\n(Knop et al. 2003). Great improvements should occur in the\nnext decade with, e.g., the Supernova\/Acceleration Probe\n(SNAP; Aldering et al. 2002) dedicated dark energy pro-\ngram, in particular extending to constraints on the generi-\ncally expected time varying function w(z).\nSeveral other cosmological probes look promising,\nthough their systematic uncertainties are less well defined.\nBut the eventual synergy of independent and complemen-\ntary methods should prove powerful in revealing the nature\nof dark energy. Some of these probes offer the opportunity\nto measure fairly directly the expansion rate behavior H(z),\nrather than just the distance which involves this quantity\nthrough a redshift integral. In turn, H(z) involves an in-\ntegral over the equation of state w(z). One cannot however\nna\u00a8\u0131vely assume that a limited measure of H(z) is better than\nknowing the distance over a wide redshift range. This was\ndemonstrated for the cosmic shear, or Alcock-Paczyn\u00b4ski, ef-\nfect in Linder (2002b) and the baryon oscillation probe in\nLinder (2003b) (see Huterer & Turner 2001, for a variety of\nother methods). But such information can prove valuable in\ncomplement with precision distance data.\nFurthermore, methods involving the growth of large\nscale structure appear, initially at least, to possess sensi-\ntivity to the cosmic equation of state. This enters through\nthe actual growth of density fluctuations, i.e. the balance\n2 Linder & Jenkins\nof attractive gravitational stability with the dynamic fric-\ntion of the expansion, through its evolution with redshift or\ntime as the dynamics changes under the influence of dark\nenergy, and through the cosmic volume available in which\nstructures form. However little rigorous work has been done\non the full impact of dark energy other than for the time\nindependent cosmological constant model. This especially\napplies to the virtually universal time varying EOS models,\nwhere not just the energy density but the function w(z) is\ntime dependent. Indeed a constant w model (other than the\ncosmological constant w = \u22121) functions only as a crude\napproximation, unsuitable for next generation data that ex-\ntends beyond z \u2248 0.5 or that seeks to combine complemen-\ntary probes. Moreover, the important and revelatory physics\nresponsible for the accelerating universe appears in the field\ndynamics \u2013 the time variation w\u2032 \u223c dw\/dz.\nIf we desire to take advantage of the power of large\nscale structure formation as a probe of dark energy, we\nmust include sufficient realism in the model that we form\na consistent picture of the underlying physics. This includes\nboth systematic uncertainties in the astrophysics and ob-\nservations, and a treatment of time variation in the dark\nenergy EOS. Structure based methods such as weak lensing,\nSunyaev-Zel\u2019dovich distance measures, and cluster counts all\nrequire knowledge of how structure formation behaves in the\npresence of realistic dark energy. In Section 2 we present the\nkey role of w\u2032 in describing the dynamics of the expansion\nand in Section 3 solve the growth equation in linear pertur-\nbation theory. Section 4 describes the numerical simulation\nof large scale structure in the presence of dark energy and\nSection 5 discusses the results. Implications and an outline\nof future research are presented in Section 6.\n2 w\u2032 IS EVERYWHERE\nThe expansion rate of the universe, H(z) = a\u02d9\/a, where a(t)\nis the scale factor, enters into both the kinematics and dy-\nnamics of the cosmological model. Distances are integrals of\nthe proper or conformal time; for example in a flat universe\n(assumed throughout) the comoving distance is\nr(z) =\n\u222b 1\na\ndt\/a(t) =\n\u222b z\n0\ndz\/H(z), (1)\nwhere the redshift z = a\u22121 \u2212 1. The angular diameter dis-\ntance is just ra = r\/(1 + z) and the luminosity distance\nis rl = (1 + z) r. The expansion rate, or Hubble parame-\nter, H(z) also enters into dynamical quantities such as the\ngrowth of structure through a \u201cHubble drag\u201d term.\nWithin the flat universe, dark energy picture, the Fried-\nmann equations give the expansion rate as\nH2(z)\/H20 = \u2126m(1+z)\n3+(1\u2212\u2126m) e\n3\n\u222b\nz\n0\nd ln(1+z\u2032)[1+w(z\u2032)]\n, (2)\nwhere H0 is the Hubble constant, the present value of the\nHubble parameter, \u2126m is the dimensionless matter density\ntoday (so the dark energy density is 1 \u2212 \u2126m), and w(z)\nis the generically time dependent dark energy equation of\nstate. While each model of dark energy has a particular form\nfor w(z), in order to compare models one usually adopts\na parametrisation. The one proposed by Linder (2003a):\nw(z) = w0 + waz\/(1 + z), with w0 the present value of the\nEOS and the time variation w\u2032 \u2261 dw\/d ln(1+z)|z=1 = wa\/2,\nallows consideration of data extending to z > 1 and presents\nan excellent approximation to slow roll scalar field dark en-\nergy models (Linder 2002a). Thus we can use the observa-\ntions in a well defined manner to investigate the fundamental\nphysics manifesting in the EOS time variation.\nHowever, a time varying equation of state is more gen-\neral than this. Some theories have been proposed that ex-\nplain the acceleration not through a scalar field dark energy\nbut through modifications of the Friedmann equations them-\nselves by alternative theories of gravitation, e.g. arising from\nextra dimensions, or by highly speculative components such\nas the Chaplygin gas or quantum or higher dimensional cor-\nrections. In Linder (2003a), a formalism was presented to\nuse supernova distance data to constrain these scenarios by\nmeans of mapping the expansion history a(t) directly, rather\nthan using an intermediate parametrisation w(z). While this\nis valid, and probably physically preferred, we note here an\nalternate interpretation.\nConsider Eq. (2). The dark energy term really just de-\nscribes our ignorance concerning the physical mechanism\nleading to the observed effects of acceleration in the expan-\nsion, i.e. an increase in the expansion rate. Let us instead\nwrite this as\nH2(z)\/H20 = \u2126m(1 + z)\n3 + \u03b4H2\/H20 , (3)\nwhere now we encapsulate any modification to the Fried-\nmann equation of general relativity in the last term. That\nis, we take a very empirical approach: all we have observed\nfor sure is a certain energy density due to matter, \u2126m, and\nconsequences of the expansion rate H(z).\nWe can now write the deceleration parameter generally\nas\nq \u2261 \u2212\naa\u00a8\na\u02d92\n=\n1\n2\n\u2212\n3\n2\n\u03b4H2\nH2\n\u2212\n1\n2\n\u02d9(\u03b4H2)\nH3\n. (4)\nIf we interpret the modified expansion rate as being due to a\nw(z) as appearing in Eq. (2) \u2013 whether or not it has anything\nto do with a scalar field \u2013 then we find\nw(z) \u2261 \u22121 +\n1\n3\nd ln \u03b4H2\nd ln(1 + z)\n. (5)\nThis now defines an effective, time varying equation of state\n(something similar was noticed by Alam et al. 2003). Of\ncourse it reduces to the usual result in the scalar field dark\nenergy case. But this goes to illustrate the centrality of a\ntime varying w(z) \u2013 or something that looks just like it \u2013\nfor probing cosmological models. To fix the EOS to be a\nconstant w rather than a varying function w(z) is highly\nnon-generic, an unjustified assumption and a frequently poor\napproximation, and can blind us to important physics.\n3 LINEAR PERTURBATION THEORY\nThe growth of structure depends sensitively on the expan-\nsion rate of the universe. For example, the solution to the\nclassic Jeans instability in a static space shows exponen-\ntial growth under gravity, while this gets reduced to only a\npower law behavior in time in an expanding space-time. The\nperturbations are sourced in the gravitational instability of\nslightly denser regions having correspondingly greater grav-\nitational attractions and thus further increasing in density;\nCosmic Structure Growth and Dark Energy 3\nthis is opposed by an effective friction, or \u201cHubble drag\u201d\nterm, due to the expansion.\nSince dark energy affects the expansion rate, one ex-\npects to see an influence due to the friction. That this can be\nsubstantial comes from our experience that open universes,\nwhich effectively have a component with EOS w = \u22121\/3,\ncan shut off the growth of structure when the curvature en-\nergy density dominates over the matter density. Similar re-\nsults hold for a cosmological constant dominated universe.\nThus for general dark energy models the state of structure\nformation at various redshifts could probe the equation of\nstate, and even its time variation (we fix the sound speed\nto its canonical value, cs = 1). We first present a general,\npedagogical analysis of the influence of EOS on growth in\nthe linear perturbation regime, then specifically calculate\nthe results for various dark energy models.\n3.1 Growth of Linear Perturbations\nOn scales smaller than the horizon, the dark energy\ncomponent is expected to be smooth (Ma et al. 1999;\nDave\u00b4, Caldwell, & Steinhardt 2003) so we only consider per-\nturbations to the matter. Then the growth equation becomes\n\u03b4\u00a8 + 2H\u03b4\u02d9 \u2212 (3\/2)H2\u2126m\u03b4 = 0 (6)\n\u03b4\u2032\u2032 + (2\u2212 q)a\u22121\u03b4\u2032 \u2212 (3\/2)\u2126ma\n\u22122\u03b4 = 0, (7)\nwhere \u03b4 is the fractional matter density perturbation, q is the\ndeceleration parameter, dot denotes a time derivative and\nprime a derivative with respect to scale factor a. One can\nreadily see that growth in a universe with \u2126tot and \u2126\u22121\/3\nin a component characterized by w = \u22121\/3 behaves like\ngrowth in a universe with no such component but \u2126\u2032tot =\n\u2126tot\u2212\u2126\u22121\/3. So a flat universe with a w = \u22121\/3 component\nacts like an open universe.\nWe can write the growth equation in terms of the gen-\neral EOS w(z), which as we saw in \u00a72 can also represent\nmodifications to the framework of the theory. Because the\ninterpretation of the source and drag terms is so straight-\nforward, this generalization broadly (but not always: see the\nobject lesson within standard gravitation in the Appendix)\ncarries over to the growth dynamics. Defining the growth as\nthe ratio of the perturbation amplitude at some scale fac-\ntor relative to some initial scale factor, D = \u03b4(a)\/\u03b4(ai), the\nequation becomes (Linder 1988)\nD\u2032\u2032 +\n3\n2\n[\n1\u2212\nw(a)\n1 +X(a)\n]\nD\u2032\na\n\u2212\n3\n2\nX(a)\n1 +X(a)\nD\na2\n= 0 . (8)\nX(a) =\n\u2126m\n1\u2212 \u2126m\ne\n\u22123\n\u222b\n1\na\nd ln a\u2032 w(a\u2032)\n(9)\n= \u2126ma\n\u22123\n\/\n(\u03b4H2\/H20 ) (10)\nwhere Eq. 9 gives the general case of X and Eq. 10 puts it\nin terms of the time dependent scalar field equation of state.\nThe variable X is the ratio of the matter density to the\ndark energy density, and the growth equation holds even if\nflatness does not, so we do not set X\/(1 +X) = \u2126m(a). As\nX gets small the source term vanishes and growth cannot\ngenerally proceed. Note that this is the reason why (sub-\nhorizon dark matter) perturbations cannot effectively grow\nin the radiation dominated epoch, not from any overriding\ninfluence of the Hubble drag term. (Of course we have not in-\ncluded coupling between components; radiation-baryon cou-\npling prevents gravitational instability in the baryon per-\nturbations). From Eq. (8), one sees that the friction term\nopposing the growth is proportional to 1 \u2212 w when matter\nis not dominant. So in the radiation epoch the drag is less\nthan in an open or accelerating epoch. It is only for those\ncases when w < 1\/3, as comes from solving the characteris-\ntic equation, that the growth is shut off by the friction term.\n(Indeed growth can occur for w > 1\/3.)\nOne can readily verify that for large X one recovers the\nmatter dominated behavior D \u223c a. It is convenient to re-\nmove this trend, common to all the considered cosmological\nmodels at high redshift, and define a variable G = D\/a. The\nevolution equation for this \u201cnormalized\u201d growth is\nG\u2032\u2032 +\n[\n7\n2\n\u2212\n3\n2\nw(a)\n1 +X(a)\n]\nG\u2032\na\n+\n3\n2\n1\u2212 w(a)\n1 +X(a)\nG\na2\n= 0 . (11)\nThrough the cosmological Poisson equation G is related to\nboth the gravitational potential and peculiar velocity fields.\nThis formalism readily allows incorporation of dark en-\nergy with a time varying EOS, or the alternate equation of\nmotion Eq. (3). Figure 1 illustrates the solutions for a vari-\nety of dark energy models. Note that models with constant\nequation of state have modest differences from the cosmo-\nlogical constant case, \u223c 7% for w = \u22120.8. This is still larger\nthan the differences caused by changing the matter density\nby \u00b10.02, shown by the dotted curves flanking the cosmo-\nlogical constant model.\nDark energy whose EOS is negatively evolving, w\u2032 < 0,\ne.g. acts more like a cosmological constant in the past but\nwith a less negative EOS today, is almost indistinguishable\nin its linear growth predictions from the cosmological con-\nstant. This is because the dark energy contribution to the\ntotal energy density only becomes significant at late times\nin these models. This property holds as well for dark energy\nmodels with EOS w < \u22121.\nHowever, the class of models with w\u2032 > 0 exhibits dra-\nmatically different behavior. This includes what we chose as\nour fiducial model to test time varying EOS, the supergrav-\nity inspired model SUGRA of Brax & Martin (1999) that is\nwell fit by w0 = \u22120.82, wa = 0.58 (i.e. w\n\u2032 = +0.29). Note\nthat Linder (2002a) has shown that the fit is good to 3% in\nw at z = 1.7 and to 0.2% in distance to the last scattering\nsurface at z = 1089.\nModels with w\u2032 > 0 show definite differences in the\ngrowth of structure from a cosmological constant universe.\nFor a model like SUGRA (here actually w0 = \u22120.8, w\n\u2032 =\n0.3) the growth disparity reaches 26% at the present day.\nThe figure shows two other points of interest. Comparing\nSUGRA to the constant EOS model that matches its dis-\ntance to the last scattering surface, and so effectively mimics\nthe time varying model as far as CMB data is concerned (ex-\ncept at low multipoles), the difference in total growth is 12%.\nThat is, the time varying model and the constant, effective\nmodel can be distinguished through large scale structure in-\nformation, despite being largely degenerate in their CMB\npower spectra. This is a promising sign.\nThe other interesting element is that even at high red-\nshift the time varying model with w\u2032 > 0 possesses dif-\nferent behavior from the cosmological constant and other\nconstant w models. This shows the influence of dark en-\n4 Linder & Jenkins\nFigure 1.

Such a characteristic offers the possibility that evi-\ndence for time varying EOS dark energy might be found as\nwell in the low multipole region of the CMB power spectrum\n(see Caldwell et al. 2003, for a discussion of the influence of\n\u201cearly quintessence\u201d on the CMB through the integrated\nSachs-Wolfe effect).\nSo three avenues appear to be open for the detection\nof physically important properties of dark energy from its\ninfluence on large scale structure: 1) linear growth rate, 2)\nnonlinear structure formation and evolution, and 3) large\nangle power in the CMB power spectrum. In the remainder\nof this section we investigate further the first avenue and\nthen proceed in \u00a74 to discuss numerical simulations of the\nsecond possibility (see Benabed & Bernadeau 2001, for an\nanalytic attempt). The third approach has been addressed\nby Hu (2002) with not very optimistic conclusions (but see\nCooray, Huterer & Baumann 2003).\nSomewhat different results for the linear growth rate\nappear if we change the measurement technique. Suppose\nthat rather than normalizing the density perturbations by\ntheir high redshift behavior (currently corresponding to\nCOBE\/WMAP normalisation of the matter power spec-\ntrum, though Planck will provide great improvement), we\ncalibrate them by their present amplitude. This is like fix-\ning \u03c38, the power on the interface of linear\/nonlinear scales.\nWhile observations have not yet determined this precisely,\nwe can explore the consequences. As seen in Fig. 2, now\nthe models are difficult to distinguish at low redshifts and\nthere is near degeneracy in the growth factor between the\nFigure 2. Same as Fig. 1 but with the growth factors normalized\nby their values today. The present growth, related to the mass\nvariance \u03c38, is not yet precisely known, however.\ntime varying model and the effective constant w model that\nmatches it with respect to the CMB.\nThe issue of the optimal way to measure the growth fac-\ntor through the matter power spectrum is an area of ongoing\nresearch, increasingly important with the future advanced\nlarge scale structure surveys. Perhaps the most realistic ob-\nservable for now is the ratio of growth factors at different\nredshifts, a measure of the evolution of structure. This will\ncarry correspondingly less content since it is only a relative\nmeasure, without information from the absolute level. Such\na ratio could be read off from either Fig. 1 or 2 and indeed\ncan be seen to vary little with cosmological model. For ex-\nample, the evolution between z = 2 and z = 1 in the models\nwith (w0, wa) = (\u22120.8, 0) or (\u22120.8, 0.3) agrees with the evo-\nlution in the cosmological constant model to 2% or 5%. This\ncasts strong doubt on the idea that the growth evolution of\nlarge scale structure by itself (without a precise and robust\nhigh redshift, CMB normalisation) is useful as a probe of\ndark energy.\n3.2 Sensitivity of Linear Growth Rate to Dark\nEnergy\nTo understand the use of the evolution of linear matter den-\nsity perturbations for probing the dark energy, we need to\nstudy not just the gross differences in the curves in Fig. 1\nbut the details of how they depend on dark energy proper-\nties and other cosmological parameters. We use the Fisher\nmatrix formalism (see, e.g., Tegmark et al. 1998) to plot the\nsensitivity of the growth to the parameters \u2126m, w0, and wa\nin Fig. 3. The sensitivity increases toward low redshift since\nthis corresponds to more time for the differing growth dy-\nnamics to take effect.\nBesides the sensitivity, the degeneracy between param-\neters is a crucial aspect to the usefulness of the probe. The\nsimilarity of the shapes of the w0 and wa curves guarantees\nCosmic Structure Growth and Dark Energy 5\nFigure 3. Logarithmic sensitivity of the growth factor to the\ncosmological parameters, perturbed around the cosmological con-\nstant model, as a function of redshift. Such a plot is useful in find-\ning lower bounds to parameter estimation errors and in indicating\ndegeneracies between parameters.\na strong degeneracy between them, apart from further inter-\naction with the value of \u2126m. Combined with the relatively\nlow accuracy achievable on the growth factor from observa-\ntions, this leads to the growth factor by itself \u2013 even with\nthe initial amplitude known \u2013 not serving as a precision cos-\nmological probe. For example, even if all other parameters\nwere fixed, a 5% determination of \u03b4\/a at z = 1, say, would\nonly constrain w0 to \u00b10.35. And degeneracies strongly am-\nplify the uncertainty. Additionally, the degeneracy direction\nin the w0 \u2212 wa plane is roughly aligned with the contours\nfrom the CMB, so the growth factor possesses little comple-\nmentarity with the CMB and only a modest amount with\nthe supernova distance measure.\nFor the simulated data sets we consider a measurement\nof the growth factor to 5% (equivalent to 10% determina-\ntion of the linear power spectrum) at three values of the scale\nfactor (equivalent to z = 0.67, 1.5, 4), SNAP supernova mea-\nsurements (including systematic uncertainties), and Planck\nCMB determination of the angular distance to the last scat-\ntering surface (normalisation of the primordial power is im-\nplicit in the growth factor measurement). The results, shown\nin Fig. 4, are not sensitive to the exact redshifts chosen for\nthe growth factor estimates. Addition of growth information\nimproves constraint of w0, wa by less than 2%. This holds\nas well if the growth factor is normalized to z = 0.\nHowever, as was found for the baryon oscillation method\n(Linder 2003b), the situation changes dramatically when the\nfiducial dark energy model is not taken to be the cosmologi-\ncal constant but the SUGRA model with time varying EOS.\nNow the growth factor under the influence of the dynamic\nfield has a different cosmological dependence and possesses\nsubstantial complementarity with both the supernova and\nCMB data, as shown in Fig. 5. The parameter uncertainties\nusing all three methods in synergy become \u03c3(w0) = 0.04,\nFigure 4. Parameter estimations (68% confidence level) of the\npresent equation of state and its time variation, marginalizing\nover the matter density \u2126m with a prior of \u03c3(\u2126m) = 0.03. Dot-\nted curves use the growth factor normalized to its value today.\nThe growth factor alone (not shown) is poor in constraining the\ncosmological model, and offers little complementary leverage for\nthe proposed SNAP supernova survey, and none in addition to\nSNAP plus the Planck CMB survey.\n\u03c3(w\u2032) = 0.05 (recall that w\u2032 = wa\/2). That gives a 6\u03c3 de-\ntection of time variation in the EOS!\nA further interesting characteristic of the growth factor\nis a sufficiently distinct cosmological dynamics dependence\nto break some degeneracies outside the dark energy frame-\nwork. For example, the braneworld model with crossover\nscale H0rc = 1.43 discussed in Linder (2003a), difficult to\ndistinguish from a w = \u22120.7 dark energy model through the\ndistance relation (< 0.5% difference), does differ by \u223c 4%\nin the growth factor (though not when normalized at low\nredshift). This illustrates the utility of the \u03b4H2 formalism of\n\u00a72 for testing the cosmological framework.\n3.3 Growth Rate and Weak Gravitational Lensing\nOne of the main applications of the growth rate is to cosmo-\nlogical observables that statistically characterize large scale\nstructure. In \u00a74 we address how the ingredient of the linear\ngrowth factor enters description of nonlinear structure. But\nhere we make a brief, illustrative foray into the linear regime\nof the weak lensing shear used to map out the matter dis-\ntribution (including dark matter) through its gravitational\ndeflection of light from distant sources.\nObservations of such shear are becoming increasingly\nuseful cosmological tools and depend on the primordial mat-\nter density power spectrum, the growth rate, and geomet-\nric distance factors. We examine the simplified, though cen-\ntral, quantity of the shear linear lensing power spectrum (cf.\nJain & Seljak 1997; Huterer 2002):\nC\u2113 \u223c\n\u222b zs\n0\ndzl\n[\n\u2126m(1 + zl)\n(\nrls\nrs\n)\nG(zl)\n]2 1\nH(zl) rl\n. (12)\n6 Linder & Jenkins\nFigure 5. Same as Fig. 4 but for dark energy following the\nSUGRA model, with present equation of state w0 = \u22120.82 and\ntime variation wa = 0.58. In this case, information on the linear\ngrowth factor adds valuable constraints.\nHere zl is the redshift of the lensing mass, zs of the source\ngalaxy, rs the comoving distance to the source, and rls the\ncomoving distance between the source and the lens. For sim-\nplicity we used the linear matter power spectrum Pk \u223c kG\n2\nand fix zs. The latter corresponds to having tomographic\ninformation.\nWe find that this lensing combination alone cannot\nplace useful constraints on the dark energy but it does have\ngood complementarity with the supernova distance measure-\nments. Such lensing data strongly improves the determina-\ntion of \u2126m, as traditionally expected, and reduces uncer-\ntainty in the time variation wa slightly more dramatically\nthan CMB information. However it has little complemen-\ntarity with CMB data, and so the limits are not much fur-\nther improved (1%) on inclusion of both lensing and CMB\ndata. Fig. 6 shows the case of 5% determination of the weak\nlensing shear power spectrum at zs = 1.5. Results are not\nvery sensitive to the exact redshift, or combination, chosen.\nThe SUGRA case leads to similar conclusions, though there\nthe weak lensing has more complementarity with the CMB\nand adding the lensing information tightens the constraints\non w0 and wa from supernovae and CMB by 34%. Thus\nthe SNAP weak lensing program in combination with the\nSNAP supernova survey provides an important crosscheck\non the results from SNAP supernovae plus CMB, plus the\npossibility of additional improvements.\nOf course the probe may be further strengthened by us-\ning information from the nonlinear part of the power spec-\ntrum. To employ the nonlinear regime, one needs to carry\nout numerical simulations including a time varying EOS or\nuse fitting formulas valid for such cases, neither of which\npreviously existed. In the remainder of the paper we present\nand discuss such a simulation.\nFigure 6. Parameter estimations (68% confidence level) of dark\nenergy properties using future 5% measurement of the weak grav-\nitational lensing linear power spectrum in addition to SNAP su-\npernova distances and Planck CMB data. The lensing power has\ngood complementarity with supernovae, though little with the\nCMB. Thus supernovae plus lensing should provide a valuable\ncrosscheck on supernovae plus CMB results.\n4 A SIMULATION OF LARGE SCALE\nSTRUCTURE FORMATION\nSo far in this paper we have concentrated on the dependence\nof the linear growth factor on the nature of the dark energy.\nIn this section we turn our attention to the influence of the\ndark energy on the growth of non-linear large-scale structure\n\u2013 specifically the dark matter halo mass function. This mea-\nsure of the number density of objects as a function of mass\nis important in a wide range of large-scale structure areas,\nincluding the use as a probe of the cosmological model.\nTheoretically the dark matter halo mass function has\nbeen explored in CDM models mainly through n-body sim-\nulations e.g. Efstathiou et al. (1988); Lacey & Cole (1994);\nGross et al. (1998); Governato et al. (1999); Jenkins et al.\n(2001); White (2001, 2002). Nearly all simulations to date\nfocussing on this issue have modelled a universe in which the\ndark energy is static \u2013 a cosmolological constant \u039b \u2013 and the\nmatter component is exclusively dark \u2013 and have ignored\nthe fluid and dissipative nature of the baryonic component.\nThe baryons are taken into account when computing the\ninput matter transfer function used in making the initial\nconditions for the simulation. In the simulation itself it is\nassumed that the baryons behave as a pressureless compo-\nnent which mirrors the dark matter precisely. Modelling of\nthe formation of individual haloes where a baryonic com-\nponent is included, for example the Santa Barbara cluster\ncomparison project (Frenk et al. 1999), lends support to the\nidea that one can determine the mass function for virialised\ndark matter haloes well without including the baryons at\nleast for the high mass end.\nAt the same time as progress has been made studying\nthe mass function using n-body simulations, analytic formu-\nCosmic Structure Growth and Dark Energy 7\nlae have been developed to describe the mass functions. The\nmost influential work was pioneered by Press & Schechter\n(1974) which utilises the spherical top-hat model of col-\nlapse. Comparisons of the Press-Schechter mass function\nto n-body simulations by a number of authors have noted\nthat the Press-Schechter mass function tends to overesti-\nmate the mass function at low masses and underestimate\nthe high mass end. This discrepancy has led to the develop-\nment of improved analytic mass function formulae, such as\nthe work of Sheth & Tormen (1999); Sheth, Mo & Tormen\n(2001); Sheth & Tormen (2002) (S-T hereafter), based on a\nmodel which accounts for ellipsoidal rather than spherical\ncollapse. However in this paper we will concentrate on the\n\u2018universal\u2019 mass function formula presented in Jenkins et al.\n(2001) (J01 hereafter), which is an empirical fit to a wide\nrange of simulation data (of which those used by S-T form\na subset). As we will show in the next section this for-\nmula does actually predict the mass functions in a SUGRA\nquintessence model without needing modification.\nBoth simulations and the analytic formulae show for\nCDM models with Gaussian power spectra that the high\nmass end of the halo mass function is very sensitive to the\nprecise normalisation of the power spectrum. If one can by\nsome means determine the halo mass function over a range of\nredshifts then in principle one can find how the linear growth\nfactor evolves as a function of redshift for the universe.\nThe dark matter halo mass function is not directly ob-\nservable, though future observations exploiting weak grav-\nitational lensing will make progress in this direction. How-\never it is believed that the largest dark matter haloes are\nrecognisable because they host galaxy clusters. Galaxy clus-\nters contain, as well as galaxies, copious amounts of x-ray\nemitting gas. The presence of x-ray emitting gas not only\nsignals the presence of the cluster halo which helps to find\nand count them, but can also be exploited to estimate the\nactual mass of the surrounding dark matter halo in a va-\nriety of ways. Estimates of the halo mass function using\nobservational data of galaxy clusters have been made and\nutilised by many authors to estimate the value of the matter\npower quantity \u03c38 locally - e.g. White, Efstathiou & Frenk\n(1993),Viana & Liddle (1996), Eke, Cole & Frenk (1996),\nSeljak (2002). Observations of clusters over a range of red-\nshifts potentially enables the evolution of the growth fac-\ntor to be determined. Two difficulties to surmount in using\nclusters as cosmological probes are the relation of the ob-\nservables to theoretical characteristics, e.g. mass, and then\nthe extraction of cosmological parameters free from astro-\nphysical factors and degeneracies. The typical uncertainty\nin the theoretically determined mass functions are around\n10%. However making accurate mass estimates of galaxy\nclusters is far from easy and comparing an observationally\ndetermined mass function with the relatively clean theoreti-\ncal mass function requires extensive and detailed modelling\n- it is not our aim in this paper to discuss these important\naspects.\nAs mentioned above the mass function formula given\nin J01 is a fit to the mass functions from a range of CDM\nsimulations. These simulations include models with a cos-\nmological constant (w = \u22121) and Open models which have\nan effective value of w = \u22121\/3. The values of interest for w\nfor the dark energy are typically within the range that has\nalready been studied so it would not seem too surprising if\nthe mass function for models with constant values of w inter-\nmediate between \u22121\/3 and \u22121 are accurately predicted by\nexisting mass function formulae. However it is interesting to\nask how the mass function of a model where the value of w is\nrapidly changing compares to the predictions. The SUGRA\nmodel of Brax & Martin (1999) is an attractive model to\nchoose for this reason because the value of w evolves rea-\nsonably rapidly.\nThe part of the mass function which is most sensitive to\nthe linear growth factor is the high mass end where the mass\nfunction falls off steeply. One would similarly expect that it\nwould be this region of the mass function that would show\nthe greatest sensitivity to a time variation in w. We therefore\nhave designed our simulation to model a large volume of\nspace so that we can measure the abundance of very massive,\nbut rare, clusters.\nAs far as we are aware the only simulations with\na quintessence component with a changing EOS are\nthose of Klypin et al. (2003) who also model the SUGRA\nquintessence together with a model by Ratra & Peebles\n(1988), which has a much more gently changing value of\nw, and some models with constant w. Their simulations\nhave very good spatial and mass resolution, allowing them\nto study the properties of individual dark matter haloes in\nsome detail. However their simulation cubes are relatively\nsmall compared to ours: even their largest simulation cube\nis some 66 times smaller in volume than our cube. The re-\nsults the authors report for the mass functions determined\nfrom their simulations appear to be fully consistent with\nour own results. Our simulations are designed to give better\nstatistics at the high mass end of the mass function and are\nin this sense complementary.\nBelow we describe the n-body code, the parameter\nchoices for the simulation and the initial conditions for the\nsimulation. The results themselves are reported in the sec-\ntion 5.\n4.1 Code details.\nWe have used the publicly available parallel code GAD-\nGET (v1.1) described in Springel, Yoshida & White (2001)\nto perform the n-body simulation. We modified the code\nto allow the inclusion of a quintessence component with an\nEOS of the form w(a) = w0 + (1 \u2212 a)wa, where a is the\nexpansion factor defined so that a = 1 at the present epoch.\nThe only modifications required to the code were to up-\ndate expressions for the Hubble parameter to include the\nquintessence component. We verified these modifications by\nchecking that the modified code can reproduce the correct\nlinear growth rates on a series of test simulations. We will\nonly report the results of this test for the simulation pre-\nsented here.\nWe determined the linear growth rates from the n-\nbody simulation by measuring the power associated with\nthe longest wavelength modes of the simulation box for the\ninitial conditions and for each output. The longest wave-\nlength modes are least affected by non-linear effects. For\ncomparison we also computed the growth rates by numerical\nintegration of equation (11). Between z=38.9 and z=2 the\nagreement in the growth factors measured from the simula-\ntion and computed by numerical quadrature is better than\n0.2%. This is a non-trivial test that the code can handle a\n8 Linder & Jenkins\nquintessence component because the SUGRA model has an\nEOS w = \u22120.25 at the upper redshift and by redshift 2 the\nquintessence component already has a significant dynami-\ncal influence: for example the value of G(a) is 0.84 rather\nthan unity as it would be in a matter dominated universe.\nThe long wavelength modes grow slightly more slowly than\nthe linear theory prediction, due we believe to non-linear\neffects (see Baugh & Efstathiou 1999). By z=0, when the\nlong wavelength density fluctuations themselves have an am-\nplitude of a few percent, the agreement is better than 0.8%.\nBy comparison this difference is 25 times smaller than the\ndifference of the growth rates of the quintessence model and\n\u039bCDM over the same interval.\n4.2 Simulation details.\nWe have designed the simulation with two aims in mind:\n(i) to determine the high end of the halo mass function,\nand (ii) to match as closely as possible, at redshift zero,\nthe parameters of an existing \u039bCDM simulation so that\na direct comparison can be made. The most suitable ref-\nerence \u039bCDM simulation for determining the high mass\nend of the halo mass function is the \u039bCDM Hubble vol-\nume run described in Evrard et al. (2002) which models\na cube, 3000h\u22121Mpc on a side. We have therefore selected\nthe same values for the matter density, \u2126m, the particle\nmass and the gravitational softening length as the \u039bCDM\nHubble simulation. We also match very closely the power\nspectrum shape and amplitude of the linearly extrapolated\npower spectrum at redshift zero to those of the \u039bCDM\nHubble simulation. Our simulation volume is significantly\nsmaller than the \u039bCDM Hubble simulation at 648h\u22121Mpc\non a side.\nWe have chosen a quintessence component with a vari-\nable value of w. As discussed earlier, the choice w0 = \u22120.82,\nwa = 0.58, gives a good fit to the SUGRA quintessence\nmodel. We will refer to our simulation as the SUGRA-\nQCDM model. The parameters of the simulation are listed\nin table 1.\nThe initial conditions were generated by the serial ver-\nsion of the code that was used to generate the initial con-\nditions for the Hubble volume simulations (Evrard et al.\n2002). The initial conditions are created from an initially\nuniform particle distribution (in this case a glass distribu-\ntion generated in the way described by White 1996) by per-\nturbing the particles to give the desired power spectrum and\nusing the Zel\u2019dovich approximation (Zel\u2019dovich 1970) to as-\nsign velocities to each particle which are proportional to the\ndisplacements. The code needed to be altered to give the\ncorrect constant of proportionality, which depends on the\nlogarithmic growth d lnD\/d ln a, when assigning the veloc-\nities. The difference in this constant between an Einstein-\ndeSitter (\u2126m = 1) and quintessence model at the start red-\nshift is small - only \u223c 1.5% - though this is much larger than\nthe difference between a matter dominated and cosmological\nconstant model.\n5 SIMULATION RESULTS\nThe simulation was started at z=38.9 and outputs were\nmade at redshifts z = 3, 2, 1.5, 1, 0.5, 0.25 and 0.\nTable 1. Parameters of the SUGRA-QCDM n-body simulation -\nthe mass resolution, softening and power spectrum normalisation\nare chosen to match the \u039bCDM Hubble volume simulation de-\nscribed in Evrard et al 2002. \u03c38 is the RMS of the linear density\nfield smoothed with a top-hat filter of 8h\u22121Mpc in radius.\nParameter Value\n\u2126m 0.30\nw0 -0.82\nwa 0.58\n\u03c38(z = 0) 0.90\nBox size\/h\u22121Mpc 648\nNumber of particles 10077696\nParticle mass\/1012h\u22121M\u2299 2.25\nComoving softening length\/h\u22121Mpc 0.1\n5.1 The mass function at z=0\nTo begin with we will compare the mass functions at redshift\nzero. The z=0 linear power spectrum of the SUGRA-QCDM\nsimulation has the same shape and amplitude as the \u039bCDM\nHubble simulation by design. Analytical fitting formulae for\nmass functions such as Press & Schechter (1974), S-T and\nJenkins et al. (2001), all predict that the CDM mass func-\ntion depends primarily on the linear power spectrum. We\nwould therefore expect if one extrapolates these results to\nquintessence models that our two models should have very\nsimilar mass functions at redshift zero.\nOne potential complication in comparing two different\ncosmological models lies in the problem of how to define the\nhaloes in a consistent way so that they can be compared.\nA common approach to this problem is to use the spherical\ntop-hat collapse model to give guidance as to the expected\ncollapse overdensity of virialised objects - e.g. Lacey & Cole\n(1993); Eke, Cole & Frenk (1996). Following these argu-\nments would lead to different values for the overdensity for\nhaloes selected in \u039bCDM and SUGRA-QCDM.\nHowever we can circumvent these issues by adopting\nthe halo definition used in J01. The haloes are defined using\nthe friends-of-friends algorithm (Davis et al. 1985) with a\nlinking length of b=0.2. J01 showed that using this way of\ndefining haloes it is possible to fit the mass functions for\nCDM models with a wide range of cosmological parameters\nand redshifts with a single \u2018universal\u2019 fitting formula which\nis accurate to better than 20%. It is this simplicity which\nmotivates our choice of halo definition. In this subsection we\nwill compare the SUGRA-QCDM and \u039bCDM simulations at\nz=0 directly.\nOur ability to determine the mass function is limited by\na number of considerations. At the high mass end, where the\nobjects themselves are resolved with the largest numbers of\nparticles, the main limitation in determining the mass func-\ntion is the volume of the box. We plot the mass functions\nonly up to the point where the Poisson error reaches 10%.\nAt the low mass end the situation is less simple. One would\nexpect determination of the mass function to be less and less\nreliable as one resolves haloes with fewer and fewer particles.\nWe take a limit of 20 particles as the minimum number of\nparticles. This limit is supported by tests presented in ap-\npendix A of J01 where they compare the mass functions from\nsimulations with the same mass resolution as our SUGRA-\nCosmic Structure Growth and Dark Energy 9\nFigure 7. Top panel: the dark matter halo mass function defined\nusing the friends-of-friends algorithm with a linking length of 0.2.\nThe mass functions of \u039bCDM Hubble simulations and SUGRA-\nQCDM that at z=0 have nearly identical power spectra are very\nsimilar. The mass functions are plotted for haloes of 20 particles\nand more and up to an upper mass cut-off where the Poisson\nuncertainty in the mass function first exceeds 10%.

The mass functions agree very well - the differences\nare below 10%. This is an encouraging result ( a similar re-\nsult is also seen in Klypin et al. 2003) and suggests that it\nshould be possible to predict the mass functions for this and\nother quintessence models with a smoothly varying value\nof w with a precision of \u223c 10% from a knowledge of just\nthe linearly evolved power spectrum. In the next section we\nwill compare the SUGRA-QCDM mass function with the\nuniversal mass function formula of J01 directly for several\nredshifts.\n5.2 The mass function at all redshifts\nHere we will plot the combined mass functions at redshifts\n3, 2, 1.5, 1, 0.5, 0.25 and 0 for the SUGRA-QCDM run and\ncompare them with the J01 mass function formula. But we\nfirst repeat a few definitions, adapted from J01, which are\nrequired further on.\nIt is convenient to use as an effective mass variable,\nln \u03c3\u22121, where \u03c3(M) is the RMS of the linear density field\nsmoothed with a top-hat filter containing mass M at the\nmean density. This is defined as:\n\u03c32(M, z) =\nD2(z)\n2pi2\n\u222b\n\u221e\n0\nk2P (k)W 2(k;M)dk, (13)\nwhere D(z) is the growth factor of linear perturbations nor-\nmalised so that D(0) = 1, P (k) is the linear power spectrum\nat redshift zero and W (k;M) is the Fourier-space represen-\ntation of a real-space top-hat filter enclosing mass M at the\nmean density of the universe.\nWe define the mass function f(ln \u03c3\u22121, z) through:\nf(ln \u03c3\u22121, z) \u2261\nM\n\u03c10\ndn(M, z)\nd ln \u03c3\u22121\n, (14)\nwhere n(M, z) is the abundance of halos with mass less than\nM at redshift z, and \u03c10(z) is the mean density of the uni-\nverse at that time. With these definitions we can plot the\nmass functions for any CDM model and at any redshift con-\nveniently onto the ln f \u2212 ln \u03c3\u22121 plane.\nFigure 8 shows the mass functions for the SUGRA-\nQCDM simulation, plotted in the ln f \u2212 ln\u03c3\u22121 plane, for\nredshifts z= 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2 and 3. The mass func-\ntions are plotted as dashed lines for haloes of 20 particles\nand more (as in J01) and cut-off at the high mass end when\nthe Poisson errors reach 10%. The simulation curves have\nbeen smoothed using a Gaussian with an RMS of 0.05 dex.\nThe solid line shows the J01 universal mass function fit given\nby:\nf(ln \u03c3\u22121) = 0.315 exp\n[\n\u2212 | ln\u03c3\u22121 + 0.61|3.8\n]\n, (15)\nvalid over the range \u22121.2 6 ln \u03c3\u22121 6 1.05, and the flanking\ndotted lines denote a 20% uncertainty about this fit. These\ncurves are similarly convolved with a 0.05 dex Gaussian.\nNote that the universal nature does not imply that\ndifferent models predict the same observable consequences,\nonly that they can be treated by the same parametrization.\nEach model is distinguished by its particular \u03c32(M, z) rela-\ntion.\nThe main result of this section is that the SUGRA-\nQCDM mass function is well fit by the J01 formula - at least\nto the same degree of accuracy as was found for a host of\nother CDM cosmological models. The fit is good despite the\nfact that this model has a changing value of w. It therefore\nseems likely that the J01 should work well for a wide range of\ndark energy models. Although we have used the J01 formula\nin figure 8 we could instead have used the formula of S-T.\nKlypin et al. (2003) find that the S-T formula provides an\nexcellent fit to their mass functions. We do find however that\nfor ln\u03c3\u22121 above about 0.75 that J01 formula is definitely a\nbetter fit, with the S-T formula tending to overpredict the\nnumber of haloes.\nIt is apparent from figure 8 that the most significant\ndeviation away from J01 formula occurs for ln \u03c3\u22121 > 0.85,\nwhere only the z = 3 output contributes. A closer analysis\nof this curve and other curves shows that the plotted mass\nfunctions tend to drop away relative to the J01 curve for\nsmall numbers of particles per group. This drop off is par-\nticularly apparent for the z = 3 and 2 outputs where the\nmass function is steep. The cause of this feature is unclear\nbut is likely numerical in origin. The influence of the dark\nenergy component diminishes as one goes to higher redshift\nand the J01 formula works well for matter dominated mod-\nels - so if anything one would expect the degree of fit to\nimprove with increasing redshift contrary to what is seen.\n10 Linder & Jenkins\nFigure 8. The halo mass functions for the SUGRA-QCDM simu-\nlation plotted in the f\u2212 ln\u03c3\u22121 plane for redshifts 0,0.25,0.5,1,2,3.\nThe smooth solid curve flanked by dotted curves marks the J01\nuniversal mass function formula. The dotted lines mark a \u00b120%\nuncertainty in the mass predicted mass function. The SUGRA-\nQCDM mass functions are plotted for groups of 20 or more\nparticles and up to the point where the Poisson error becomes\n10%. The SUGRA-QCDM mass function is well fit by the Jenk-\nins et al formula. Some departure is apparent at high values of\nln\u03c3\u22121 > 0.85, but as discussed in the text the origin of this de-\nparture is likely due to numerical limitations rather than being\nreal.\nThis divergence is much less pronounced at lower redshift\nand is not apparent in the resolution tests presented in ap-\npendix A of J01 for the Hubble volume simulations which\nare for redshift zero.\nTo conclude, firstly we have found in this section that\nthe z = 0 mass functions of the Hubble \u039bCDM simulation\nand our own SUGRA-QCDM simulation match to a preci-\nsion of better than 10% in abundance for haloes in the mass\nrange of 4.5\u00d71013\u22122\u00d71015h\u22121M\u2299. By design, the z = 0 lin-\near power spectrum of the two models was closely matched.\nThe results indicate that the mass function depends primar-\nily on the linear power spectrum and is only very weakly if\nat all dependent on the details of the expansion history. Sec-\nondly, from an analysis of the SUGRA-QCDM mass func-\ntion at a range of redshifts we find that mass function for-\nmulae such as J01 and S-T provide good estimates of the\nhalo mass function for flat quintessence models. The J01\nformula gives a better fit at the high mass end than S-T for\nln \u03c3\u22121 > 0.75. The goodness of fit is comparable with that\nfound when comparing these formulae to the mass functions\ndetermined from the following cosmological models: matter\ndominated, open, and flat models with a cosmological con-\nstant. We are able to verify the accuracy of the fit over range\n\u22120.2 < ln \u03c3\u22121 < 0.85 from our simulation.\nThese results imply that the main observational dis-\ncriminators for large-scale structure between cosmological\nmodels are: the present linear power spectrum, to be fixed\nby wide field surveys; the linear growth factor, discussed\nin the first part of this paper and probed by future deep\nsurveys; and distances and volumes measured by expansion\nhistory mappers such as SNAP.\n6 CONCLUSIONS\nCosmic structure formation and evolution provides an ad-\nditional path to exploring the cosmological model besides\nmapping the expansion history. Many of the observational\nprobes employing structure rely on the growth dynamics of\ndensity fluctuations, in either the linear or nonlinear regime.\nLinear perturbations offer the best hope of structure\nmeasurements with relatively uncomplicated physics and\nclean observations free of many astrophysical entanglements.\nAnalyzing the linear growth behavior, we find little lever-\nage on the nature of the dark energy \u2013 unless it possesses a\ntime varying equation of state. In this latter case the growth\nshows good complementarity with supernova and CMB mea-\nsurements.\nWe have emphasized that such time variation appears\ngenerically in proposed dark energy models other than the\ncosmological constant and can also be used to treat modifi-\ncations of the cosmological framework.\nThe growth also enters as a contribution to the gravi-\ntational lensing power spectrum, and weak lensing as a cos-\nmological probe promises interesting complementarity and\ncrosschecks. Such a method can take advantage of both the\nlinear and nonlinear density scales to attempt to balance\nsensitivity with systematic uncertainties.\nFor the nonlinear realm of structure, investigations at\nthe level of precision necessary require numerical simula-\ntions. We present one of the first, and currently the largest\nvolume, N-body simulation with a time varying equation of\nstate. As a first application of the data, we calculate the\nhalo counts as a function of mass, a quantity relevant to\nforthcoming structure surveys. We find that this is well fit\nby the previous Jenkins mass formula, extending its uni-\nversality to time varying equations of state, at least at the\n20% level. At redshift zero the dynamical dark energy model\nshows agreement to better than 10% with the cosmological\nconstant simulation that matches the linear power spectrum\ntoday, suggesting this serves generally as a central quantity\nin describing structure formation.\nMuch work remains for the future to bring observations\nof structure to the level of theoretical and systematic uncer-\ntainty necessary for precision probing of dark energy. But\nthe results here lay a foundation to build upon for using not\nonly the expansion history of the universe but the growth\nhistory of structure in a rigorous quest to understand the\nphysics behind the accelerating universe.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe wish to thank Carlos Frenk for encouragement and Dra-\ngan Huterer and Bhuvnesh Jain for useful discussions.

APPROXIMATION OF THE\nLINEAR GROWTH FACTOR\nWithin the formalism of the Birkhoff\u2019s theorem argument\npresented by Peebles (1980, 1993) for the evolution of linear\ndensity perturbations, one can write a closed form expres-\nsion for the growth. However this does not hold for general\ncosmological models. While it was sufficient and indeed pre-\nscient for the main models considered in 1980, it neglects a\nterm arising for a general pressure component (as Peebles\nalludes to); this term is proportional to (1 + 3w)(1 + w)\u2126w\nand so we see that serendipitously the closed form is exact\nfor a pure matter model (SCDM, \u2126w = 0), an open model\n(OCDM, w = \u22121\/3), and a cosmological constant model\n(\u039bCDM, w = \u22121). But a second order differential equation\ndoes not generally possess such a quadrature and instead an\nequation like Eq. (8) must be solved.\nFig. 9 shows the difference between the exact solution\nfor the growth factor and the approximation given by the\nclosed form\nGapprox =\n5\n2\n\u2126m\nH\na\n\u222b a\n0\nda (aH)\u22123 . (16)\nThe differences for the time varying SUGRA model can be\n\u223c 15%; this propagates into the power spectrum as the\nsquare, and then further as a possibly substantial bias on\nthe cosmological parameters. The situation is better if future\ndetailed observations allow use of the growth factor normal-\nized to the present (\u223c 1% difference for SUGRA, though\n\u223c 5% for w = \u22121.2). See Wang & Steinhardt (1998) for a\nfitting function involving an integral over the equation of\nstate, valid at high redshifts, for slow variations.\n12 Linder & Jenkins\nFigure 9. Comparison of the exact growth factor (solid curves)\nwith the closed form approximation, Eq. 16 (dashed curves). The\nsolid curves are labeled according to the vertical ordering, and\nthe subscripts indicate the ordering of the dashed curves for those\nmodels.
