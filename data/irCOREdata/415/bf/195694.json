Res., 114,\nA07219, doi:10.1029\/2009JA014330.\n1. Introduction\n[2] The dynamics of planetary magnetospheres are fun-\ndamentally determined by two physical processes. One is\nthe rotation of the planet, which drives circulation of plasma\nin the magnetosphere via frictional coupling with its atmo-\nsphere. The other is magnetic reconnection between the\nmagnetospheric field and the interplanetary magnetic field\n(IMF), which enables the transport of plasma across the\nmagnetopause and couples solar wind energy and momen-\ntum into the system. While it has long been understood that\nthe Earth\u2019s magnetosphere is predominantly solar wind\ndriven [e.g., Dungey, 1961; Cowley et al., 2003], theoretical\nand observational evidence suggests that it is the rapid\nplanetary rotation of the gas giants that is dominant in\ngoverning the dynamics of their magnetospheres [e.g., Brice\nand Ioannidis, 1970; Hill, 1979; Siscoe and Summers, 1981;\nHill et al., 1983]. However, recent studies have suggested\nthat solar wind coupling may also play a significant role\n[e.g., Khurana, 2001; Badman et al., 2005; Nichols et al.,\n2006; Badman and Cowley, 2007; McAndrews et al., 2008],\nwhich is thus important to quantify and understand.\n[3] Studies at Earth have shown that the magnetic flux\nthat can be transferred via solar wind coupling is largely\ngoverned by the strength and direction of the IMF. Early\nstudies of geomagnetic indices revealed that geomagnetic\nactivity is greatest when the IMF is directed southward\n[Fairfield and Cahill, 1966; Rostoker and Fa\u00a8lthammar,\n1967], although more complex empirical transfer functions\nhave since been derived [e.g., Wygant et al., 1983]. One\nsuch widely used function takes the form of the solar wind\nelectric field, vSWB? (where vSW is the solar wind speed\nand B? is the IMF vector component perpendicular to the\ndirection of the solar wind flow), multiplied by an IMF\nclock angle function, f(q), (where q is the IMF clock angle,\nmeasured from north). This clock angle dependence is often\nchosen to have the form f(q) = sinn(q\/2), where n is an\ninteger usually equal to either 2 or 4 [Perreault and\nAkasofu, 1978; Kan and Lee, 1979], and will be discussed\nfurther in section 2.3, below. The dayside reconnection rate\nis then estimated by multiplying this electric field by a\ncharacteristic scale length, suggested by Milan [2004] to be\nof the order of 5\u20138 RE. This concept has been used in a\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 114, A07219, doi:10.1029\/2009JA014330, 2009\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Leicester,\nLeicester, UK.\nCopyright 2009 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/09\/2009JA014330$09.00\nA07219 1 of 9\nnumber of studies of the solar wind interaction with the\nEarth\u2019s magnetosphere [e.g., Hubert et al., 2006; Milan et\nal., 2007] and has since been adapted for use at Saturn by\nJackman et al. [2004] and at Jupiter by Nichols et al. [2006]\nand has been used to quantify and discuss the solar wind\ninteraction at these planets by Badman and Cowley [2007].\n[4] Despite these results, the extent to which magneto-\npause reconnection can influence the dynamics of the outer\nplanets is still widely debated. One argument for it having\nvery little influence stems from the suggestion that the\nefficiency of reconnection is strongly governed by the\nmagnetosonic Mach number [Russell et al., 2008], which\nis typically 10 at the orbit of Saturn compared to 6 at 1 AU\n[Russell et al., 1990]. Scurry and Russell [1991] studied the\nefficiency of the reconnection mechanism at Earth using the\nAm geomagnetic index [Mayaud, 1980] as a proxy for\nenergy transfer into the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere and found\nthat their empirically determined reconnection efficiency\nfactor based on Am drops to zero for Mach numbers larger\nthan 7. This result suggests that any transfer function\nderived under usual conditions at Earth would be invalid\nat the outer planets.\n[5] In a more direct approach to studying the reconnec-\ntion mechanism, Kuo et al. [1995] and Russell et al.\n[1996] conducted studies of flux transfer events (FTEs)\nusing magnetic field data from the International Sun-Earth\nExplorer-1\/-2 (ISEE) satellites and found that FTE occur-\nrence decreases with increasing solar wind magnetosonic\nMach number. On the other hand,Wang et al. [2006] studied\nFTE statistics using Cluster data and found that the FTE\noccurrence rate generally increases with increasing solar\nwind magnetosonic Mach number. Only beyond a Mach\nnumber of \u00028.5 did the occurrence show a significant\ndecrease, at which point their IMF and FTE distributions\nwere close to zero. Their results also revealed a slight\ngeneral increase of FTE separation time with increasing\nmagnetosonic Mach number, but no strong dependence of\nFTE peak-peak magnitude.\n[6] While the FTE studies discussed above provide a\ndirect measure of individual reconnection events, they do\nnot provide a full quantification of the reconnection process\nowing to the localized nature of the spacecraft observations.\nEven multispacecraft investigations are unable to routinely\ndetermine the azimuthal extent of FTEs which may be more\nthan 10,000 km [Fear et al., 2008]. The studies using\ngeomagnetic indices, on the other hand, do provide a more\nglobal view of the energy throughput of the magnetosphere.\nHowever, they provide a far from direct measure of the\nreconnection rate, or of the flux throughput of the magne-\ntosphere in particular, because their response to enhanced\nconvection is dependent on the ionospheric Hall conductiv-\nity. Kamide and Richmond [1982] found that estimates of\nthe ionospheric electric field obtained using geomagnetic\ndata as a proxy depend strongly upon the ionospheric\nconductivity and are thus less reliable than the electric\nfields and flows observed more directly by satellites and\nradar techniques. Indeed, Grocott et al. [2003, 2004, 2008]\nfound intervals in which dayside reconnection persisted for\nmany hours under northward, but BY dominated IMF\nconditions, without exciting any significant perturbations\nin the ground magnetic field that would be evident in\ngeomagnetic indices.\n[7] In this paper we use total ionospheric transpolar\nvoltage data, derived from radar measurements of the\nionospheric flow, as a more direct measure of the global\nflux throughput of the magnetosphere. Over suitably long\ntimescales, and in the absence of other significant drivers,\nthe transpolar voltage is equal to the dayside (and nightside)\nreconnection rate. We therefore use two hour averages of\ntranspolar voltage data as a proxy for the dayside recon-\nnection rate, which we investigate for different magneto-\nsonic Mach number regimes. Our results, from both\nstatistical analyses and case studies, show that the transpolar\nvoltage exhibits no strong variation with the magnetosonic\nMach number and, in particular, no significant downturn for\nFigure 1.

Data Analysis\n[8] Data from two sources spanning the 8 year interval\n1999\u20132006 are used in this study: upstream interplanetary\ndata from the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE)\nspacecraft [Stone et al., 1998] and ionospheric electric field\ndata from the northern hemisphere Super Dual Auroral\nRadar Network (SuperDARN [Greenwald et al., 1995]).\nSuperDARN provides a map of high-latitude ionospheric\nconvection every 2 minutes, from which we can derive the\nionospheric transpolar voltage (see section 2.2). The ACE\nSolar Wind Electron Proton Alpha Monitor (SWEPAM\n[McComas et al., 1998]) provides measurements of the\nproton speed, temperature and number density at 64 s\nresolution and the Magnetic Field Experiment (MFE [Smith\net al., 1998]) provides measurements of the IMF at 16 s\nresolution. Throughout this paper the IMF data are pre-\nsented and discussed in terms of their geocentric solar\nmagnetospheric (GSM) coordinates. These data have been\ntime-lagged to the dayside ionosphere using the method by\nKhan and Cowley [1999]. This technique involves calcu-\nlating the propagation delay of field changes from ACE to\nthe dayside ionosphere and includes the propagation time in\nthe solar wind upstream of the bow shock, the frozen-in\ntransit time across the subsolar magnetosheath, and the\nAlfve\u00b4nic propagation time along open field lines from the\nsubsolar magnetopause to the ionosphere. Both the Super-\nDARN and ACE data sets have then been averaged to a\ntime resolution of 2 hours to remove fluctuations occurring\non shorter timescales and better approximate a \u2018\u2018steady\nstate\u2019\u2019 response of the ionosphere to the solar wind. The\nimposition of further constraints on IMF and solar wind\nvariability within each 2 hour bin (e.g., standard deviation\nthresholds) was also investigated but was found to have\nlittle effect on the results. We have, however, imposed a data\ncoverage constraint on the radar data to ensure reliable\ndetermination of the transpolar voltage, discussed in more\ndetail below. Both data sets have nevertheless been kept\ncoincident so that any intervals removed from one set have\nalso been removed from the other.\n[9] The data set that results from this analysis consists of\nalmost 20,000 2-hour intervals from which to derive our\nstatistics. The specific parameters required for this study are\nthe magnetosonic Mach number, MMS, the solar wind\ntransfer function, E*, and the ionospheric transpolar volt-\nage, VPC. In the following sections we briefly describe the\nderivation of each, and their distributions, which are shown\nin Figure 1.\n2.1. Magnetosonic Mach Number\n[10] The magnetosonic Mach number, MMS, is given by\nMMS \u00bc vSWffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nvA2 \u00fe vS2\np ; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere vA is the Alfve\u00b4n speed, B\/\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nm0r\np\n, and vS is the sound\nspeed,\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\ngP=r\np\n. In each expression the solar wind mass\ndensity, r, is derived assuming an alpha particle to proton\nratio of 4%. In the calculation of the sound speed, the ratio\nof specific heats, g, is taken to be 5\/3 and the thermal\npressure, P, is given by npk(Ti + Te). Although Ti is routinely\navailable in the ACE data set, Te is not. However, according\nto Newbury et al. [1998] the solar wind electron temperature\nis relatively constant compared to the proton temperature,\nand is not influenced by other concurrent parameters in the\nsolar wind. We have therefore used their best fixed estimate\nof Te = 1.41 \b 105 K in our calculation of the pressure. The\ndistribution of MMS is shown in Figure 1a, which reveals an\napproximately Gaussian distribution ranging from \u00021 to 12,\nwith a peak at \u00026, in good agreement with the expected\nvalue at 1 AU [e.g., Russell et al., 1990].\n2.2. Ionospheric Transpolar Voltage\n[11] The ionospheric transpolar voltage, VPC, is derived\nusing the SuperDARN global convection analysis technique\nof Ruohoniemi and Baker [1998] (hereafter referred to as the\nMap Potential technique). This technique involves mapping\nthe line-of-sight radar velocity measurements onto a polar\ngrid, and using them to determine a solution for the electro-\nstatic potential, which is expressed in spherical harmonics.\nInformation from the statistical model of Ruohoniemi and\nGreenwald [1996], parameterized by concurrent IMF con-\nditions, is used to stabilise the solution where no measure-\nments are available. However, we have imposed a condition\nthat there must be at least 200 radar velocity measurements\nin any one 2-min map for it to be included in our analysis,\nwhich serves to minimize any influence of the statistical\nmodel in the results. We have also used fits only up to a\nrelatively low sixth order in the spherical harmonic expan-\nsion. As we are only interested in a global measure of the\nconvection, which derives little benefit from using higher\norders, this also serves to constrain the effects of regions of\npoor data coverage. Calculation of the total transpolar\nvoltage then simply involves taking the difference between\nthe maximum and minimum values in the potential map, i.e.\nVPC \u00bc Fmax \t Fmin; \u00f02\u00de\nFigure 2. The transpolar voltage VPC, versus IMF clock\nangle q in bins of 4 kV \b 10\u0001. Each bin is color coded to the\ncorresponding mean value of vSWB? according to the color\nbar on the right. The mean VPC in each clock angle bin is\nalso indicated (crosses on solid curve) with sin2(q\/2)\n(dashed line) and sin4(q\/2) (dotted line) functional forms\nsuperposed.\nA07219 GROCOTT ET AL.: MACH NUMBER DEPENDENCE OF RECONNECTION\n3 of 9\nA07219\nwhere F is related to the convection electric field and\nvelocity by the familiar\nE \u00bc \trF; v \u00bc E\b B\nB2\n: \u00f03\u00de\nThe transpolar voltage, VPC, should then be a very good\nproxy for the reconnection rate if we assume that the\ndayside and nightside reconnection rates are approximately\nequal over the 2-hour averages used in this study. The\ndistribution of VPC, shown in Figure 1b, also has a Gaussian\ndistribution, ranging from \u000215 to 95 kV with a peak at\n\u000250 kV. This lower limit of \u000215 kV may be related to a\ncombination of viscous coupling [Milan, 2004] or some\nminimum level reconnection that is independent of the IMF\n[Farrugia et al., 2007].\n2.3. Solar Wind Transfer Function\n[12] We have derived a solar wind transfer function\nE* \u00bc vSWB? sinn \u00f0q=2\u00de; \u00f04\u00de\nwhich is equal to the solar wind electric field (vSWB?),\nmultiplied by an IMF clock angle function (sinn(q\/2)), as\ndiscussed above. Here vSW is simply the proton bulk speed,\nas measured by the SWEPAM instrument, and is taken to be\ndirected radially away from the Sun. B? is the IMF vector\ncomponent perpendicular to vSW, and is taken to be equal toffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nB2Y \u00fe B2Z\np\n. q is the IMF clock angle, which is equal to the\nangle between the B? vector and the GSM z direction. An\ninteger, n, governs the strength of the angular dependence\nand will be discussed further in section 3.1, below. The\ndistribution of E*, shown in Figure 1c for values of n = 2\n(dashed line) and n = 4 (dotted line), decreases with\nincreasing E*, having a somewhat more even distribution\nfor n = 2. In both cases, over 80% of E* values fall below\n2 mV m\t1.\n3. Statistical Analysis\n3.1. Clock Angle Dependence of VPC\n[13] As discussed in section 1, we will be using the\ntranspolar voltage as a proxy for the reconnection rate at\nthe dayside magnetopause and, in order to account for the\nclock angle dependence of the reconnection efficiency, we\ninclude a function of q in equation (4). Before we investi-\ngate any additional dependencies of VPC, however, we\nbriefly examine what the q dependence actually is. We have\ntherefore averaged our VPC data set in 10\u0001 wide bins of IMF\nclock angle, shown in Figure 2 by the crosses and solid\ncurve, and compared the resulting trend to given functions\nof q. Although the standard errors of the mean VPC values\nare small (so much so that they are not representable in\nFigure 2) there is nevertheless some spread in VPC within\neach q bin. This spread is indicated on Figure 2 by the range\nof VPC covered by the colored rectangles. Each rectangle\nrepresents a 4 kV subdivision of each 10\u0001 clock angle bin,\nwhich has then been color coded to the mean value of the\nsolar wind electric field, vSWB?, according to the color bar\non the right. For q > 60\u0001 VPC is well ordered by vSWB?,\nsuch that higher voltages correspond to higher values of\nvSWB?. For smaller values of q (more northward IMF) the\nrelationship between VPC and vSWB? is less clear, such that\nlarger VPC are not associated with larger vSWB?. To ensure\nthat this trend is not strongly influenced by extremes of\nsolar wind velocity or total IMF strength we have compared\nthis result to that obtained using a subset of VPC\ncorresponding to the more typical ranges of solar wind\nFigure 3. (a) VPC versus E* = vSWB?sin\n4(q\/2) in bins of\n5 kV \b 0.2 mV m\t1, color coded to the mean value of\nMMS in each bin according to the color bar on the right. The\nmean VPC in each E* bin is also indicated (solid curve) with\n\u00b11 standard deviation from this mean also shown (dashed\ncurves). The columns indicated by the labels (b\u2013d) are then\nexpanded in the lower three panels which show VPC versus\nMMS for the corresponding E* ranges (black dots). Mean\nvalues of VPC in 1-unit wide bins of MMS are superposed\nwith \u00b11 standard error indicated on each mean by the short\nvertical bars.\nA07219 GROCOTT ET AL.: MACH NUMBER DEPENDENCE OF RECONNECTION\n4 of 9\nA07219\nspeed and magnetic field strength as determined by the full\nwidth at half maximum of the distributions of each. This\nreduced data set (not shown) produces a trend which is\nalmost identical, except for the expected reduction in the\nrange of vSWB?.\n[14] The dotted and dashed curves superposed on Figure 2\nillustrate sin4(q\/2) and sin2(q\/2) functions, respectively,\nadjusted in amplitude and offset to best fit the mean VPC\ncurve in each case. It is immediately evident that sin4(q\/2)\ndoes not adequately represent the clock angle dependence of\nVPC. The function rises too slowly with increasing clock\nangle at small values, and then too sharply at higher values.\nWhile this might be appropriate for modeling the clock angle\ndependence of geomagnetic indices (for reasons discussed in\nsection 1) it is clear that the sin2(q\/2) dependence provides a\nbetter fit to VPC in this case. In fact, this curve does not\nprecisely follow the shape of the VPC curve either, suggesting\nthat a different fit altogether might be appropriate. However,\nas will be shown below, sin2(q\/2) produces a significantly\nbetter ordering of VPC with respect to E* than sin\n4(q\/2),\nwhereas a rudimentary investigation into the use of other,\nFigure 4. As in Figure 3, but for the case E* =\nvSWB?sin\n2(q\/2).\nFigure 5.

In the following sections we will\nshow results using estimates of E* determined with both\nf(q) = sin2(q\/2) and f(q) = sin4(q\/2) in order to illustrate the\nsignificance of f(q) on our results.\n3.2. MMS Dependence\n[15] Figures 3 and 4 show the relationship between the\nVPC, E*, and MMS parameters discussed in section 2. In\nFigure 3, E* has been estimated using n = 4 in equation (4)\nand in Figure 4, using n = 2. In both cases (a) shows VPC\nversus E* in bins of 5 kV \b 0.2 mV m\t1, color coded to the\nmean value of MMS in each bin, according to the color bar\non the right. The mean VPC in each E* bin is also indicated\n(solid curve) with \u00b11 standard deviation from this mean also\nshown (dashed curves). The columns indicated by the labels\n(b\u2013d) are then expanded in the lower three panels which\nshow VPC versus MMS for the corresponding E* bins (black\ndots). Bins at the lower end of the E* distribution have been\nchosen because they are the most populous (see Figure 1c).\nMean values of VPC, in 1-unit wide bins of MMS, are also\nshown by crosses in (b\u2013d), with \u00b11 standard error indicated\non each mean by the short vertical bars.\n[16] Looking first at Figure 3a we see a clear dependence\nof VPC on E* such that, in general, higher transpolar\nvoltages are related to higher values of E*. The gradient\nof the mean VPC (solid curve) is noticeably highest for low\nvalues of E*, dropping rapidly with increasing E*. This\nresults in there being \u000220 kV variation in averaged VPC\nover the solar wind electric field range 0 < E* < 1 mV m\t1\nwith a further \u000220 kV variation over the range 1 < E* <\n4 mV m\t1. While there is a known tendency of the\ntranspolar voltage to saturate for high values of E* [Russell\net al., 2001; Shepherd et al., 2003] these results imply that\nthe relationship between VPC and E* with n = 4 is not very\nlinear, as assumed by Jackman et al. [2004] and Nichols et\nal. [2006], particularly at the more usual end of the E*\nrange. If we now consider the behavior of MMS we see that\nhigher MMS values are associated with lower E*, as a result\nof the dependency of both on the IMF strength. Any\nrelationship between VPC and MMS, however, is marginal\nat best. It becomes somewhat clearer if we consider fixed E*\nbins as shown in (b\u2013d) which suggest that for low E*,\nshown in (b), VPC is weakly correlated with MMS whereas\nfor higher E*, shown in (d), VPC is weakly anticorrelated\nwith MMS.\n[17] Figure 4 shows the same analysis as Figure 3 but for\nE* estimated using n = 2 in equation (4). The relationship\nbetween VPC and E* is more linear in this case, especially at\nlow E*, although there is perhaps slightly more spread in\nthe data. However, the Mach number dependence shown in\n(a) is now much more pronounced, with a very clear\nordering both with respect to E* and VPC, especially for\nthe 0 < E* < 2 mV m\t1 regime. This is again evidenced\nfurther by considering (b\u2013d). Both (b) and (c) now show a\ngeneral tendency for higher voltages to be driven at higher\nMach numbers for a given E*. While (d) now shows no\nclear dependency there is certainly no discernible evidence\nfor a downturn in VPC at high MMS. While it may be true,\ntherefore, that for unusually high solar wind electric fields a\nhigh magnetosonic Mach number will cause the ionospheric\ntranspolar voltage to saturate at a lower value, this effect is\nsmall. There is certainly no evidence for a threshold of MMS\nbeyond which VPC drops to significantly lower values, for\nany E* regime. For lower, more usual, values of E* it in fact\nFigure 6. Streamlines and vectors of the northern hemisphere ionospheric flow, derived from\nSuperDARN velocity measurements using the map potential algorithm, are shown on a geomagnetic grid\nfrom 60\u0001 to the pole, with (top) noon and (left) dusk.

In the top right-hand corner, we indicate the direction and\nmagnitude (in the Y\u2013Z plane) of the IMF and the flow model employed to stabilize the potential solution\nin regions where no data are available, obtained from the statistical study of Ruohoniemi and Greenwald\n[1996].\nA07219 GROCOTT ET AL.: MACH NUMBER DEPENDENCE OF RECONNECTION\n6 of 9\nA07219\nappears to be the case that, for a given range of E*, the\nhighest ionospheric transpolar voltages are driven when the\nMach number is high. Of course, the very highest voltages\ndo tend to be associated with lower values of MMS, but this\nappears to be due to the intrinsic anticorrelation between\nMMS and E* rather than some limit on the reconnection that\ncan be driven by a high Mach number solar wind.\n4. Case Study Examples\n[18] In the previous section we have shown that a high\nsolar wind magnetosonic Mach number does not appear to\nprohibit significant magnetosphere-solar wind coupling. In\nthis section we investigate exactly what form the convection\ndriven under such conditions might take by considering\nexemplar interplanetary and ionospheric data from two high\nMMS intervals. Figure 5 presents time series data from the\nfirst of the two intervals, 22:00 UT on 14 February\u2013\n08:00 UT on 15 February 2001, consisting of (a) the solar\nwind number density, (b) the solar wind speed, (c) the\nmagnetosonic Mach number, (d\u2013f) the three IMF GSM\ncomponents, (g) the IMF strength, (h) the IMF clock angle,\n(i) the solar wind transfer function E* (dashed line for n = 2,\ndotted line for n = 4), and (j) the ionospheric transpolar\nvoltage. The two vertical dashed lines correspond to times\nfrom which we show representative ionospheric convection\npatterns, discussed below. Looking at (c) we can see that the\nmagnetosonic Mach number was greater than 7 for the\nwhole interval, rising to between 9 and 10 for the first\n\u00024 hours. Looking at (b) and (g) we can see that this was\nlargely due to an elevated solar wind speed and concurrent\ndecrease in the total magnetic field strength. During this\ntime, as shown in (h), the IMF clock angle varied consid-\nerably, leading to the variations in E* shown in (i). VPC,\nshown in (j), peaked at \u000260 kV and remained above 40 kV\nfor much of the interval, only dropping to lower values\nwhen E* went close to zero. This provides strong evidence\nfor the persistence of dayside reconnection throughout\nthis high Mach number interval, modulated by variations\nin the IMF clock angle. Importantly, it shows that the\nenhancements in E* are generally accompanied by enhance-\nments in VPC throughout the interval, irrespective of the\nmagnitude of MMS.\n[19] In Figure 6 we show example convection patterns,\nfrom the times indicated in Figure 5 by the vertical dashed\nlines, to give an impression of the nature of the convection\nduring the interval. Two maps are shown, containing data\nfrom 23:18\u201323:20 UT and 04:44\u201304:46 UT, which consist\nof fitted radar velocity vectors, and streamlines of the\nionospheric electric potential, as discussed in section 2.2\nabove. In the first map we show the convection from the\nearlier, higher Mach number part of the interval, and we see\na fairly unremarkable twin-cell convection pattern, with\nflows of up to \u0002700 m s\t1 and a transpolar voltage of\nover 50 kV. In the second map we show the convection\nfrom later in the interval when the Mach number had\nsubsided somewhat. Although in this case the data coverage\nis to some extent reduced, there is still evidence of a similar\nflow pattern, with the same transpolar voltage. It would\nappear therefore that, irrespective of Mach number, there is\nevidence for ongoing dayside driving in both cases.\n[20] In Figures 7 and 8 we show time series data and\nconvection maps, respectively, from a second interval, on\n30 December 2004. In this case the Mach number remained\nconsistently high for longer than in the previous example,\nwith MMS > 10 for over 4 hours from \u000210:00 to 14:00 UT.\nDuring these 4 hours the total magnetic field strength\nremained low (\u00023 nT), while VPC was consistently of the\norder \u000250 kV. In this case, periods of low E* appear to\nimply an underestimate of the voltage when compared to\nhigher values earlier on in the interval. For example,\nconsider the situation at \u000208:00 UT, where E* \u000b 2 mV\nm\t1 and MMS \u000b 10, and then at \u000210:00 UT, where E* \u000b\n1 mV m\t1 and MMS \u000b 12. In both cases VPC peaks at\nFigure 7. Time series data from 30 December 2004 in the\nsame format as Figure 5.\nA07219 GROCOTT ET AL.: MACH NUMBER DEPENDENCE OF RECONNECTION\n7 of 9\nA07219\n\u000260 kV, suggesting that the higher MMS corresponds to an\nincreased reconnection efficiency such that a quasiconstant\nVPC is maintained despite the drop in E*. Turning to the\nconvection maps, they show fast flows in the noon-sector\nionosphere suggesting again that magnetopause reconnec-\ntion was ongoing. Both this interval, and the previous one,\nexhibit nothing to suggest that reconnection is not playing a\ndominant role in driving convection despite the continuing\nhigh solar wind magnetosonic Mach number.\n5. Summary\n[21] It has recently been suggested that reconnection is\nunlikely to play a dominant role in driving circulation of the\nmagnetospheres of the outer planets owing to an inefficiency\nof reconnection when the magnetosonic Mach number is\nhigh [Russell et al., 2008]. Previous studies of energy\ntransfer into the magnetosphere, such as that conducted by\nScurry and Russell [1991], used geomagnetic indices as a\nproxy for the dayside reconnection efficiency which was\nfound to tend to zero for high solar wind magnetosonic\nMach numbers. However, it has been shown previously\nthat dayside reconnection can persist for many hours at a\nmodest level, for example, during intervals of northward,\nbut BY-dominated IMF, without exciting significant per-\nturbations in the ground magnetic field that would be\nevident in geomagnetic indices [e.g., Grocott et al., 2003].\nThis suggests that these indices may be less reliable as a\nproxy for the reconnection rate than more direct satellite or\nradar techniques. We have therefore used the transpolar\nvoltage, VPC, derived from ionospheric radar measure-\nments, as a proxy for the reconnection rate and have\ninvestigated whether the relationship between VPC\nand E* = vSWB?sin\nn(q\/2) changes for different Mach\nnumber regimes.\n[22] Our results show that the IMF clock angle depen-\ndence of VPC is closely approximated by the function f(q) =\nsin2(q\/2). They also show that, although VPC tends to\nsaturate at smaller values when MMS is high, this is more\nlikely to result from the strong relationship between E* and\nMMS than any direct influence ofMMS on VPC. This we have\nillustrated by considering the relationship between VPC and\nMMS for fixed ranges of E* and we have found that, for\nmore usual vales of E* (below \u00022 mV m\t1), VPC actually\nincreases with increasing MMS. This implies that, while a\nlow E* will inherently result in a lower VPC, the reconnec-\ntion mechanism may become more efficient at high Mach\nnumbers such that significant magnetospheric circulation\ncan continue to be driven. We have also shown example\nSuperDARN convection maps from two high Mach number\nintervals which illustrate the existence of fairly typical\nreconnection driven flows and thus reveal no evidence for\na significant reduction in the reconnection rate associated\nwith high Mach numbers.\n[23] Acknowledgments.
