[1]. Recently, using the\nsimilar arguments, it has been conjectured that the intrinsic\nground- or a low-lying isomeric state of some nuclei may\npossess a tetrahedral deformation [2,3]. This kind of symmetry\nis rather common in molecules and metallic clusters [4], where\nthe mutual geometric arrangement of the ions determines the\nshape of the system. In atomic nuclei, the situation is more\ncomplicated and only sufficiently large shell effects can gen-\nerate deformed configurations. Although there is convincing\ntheoretical evidence for the presence of tetrahedral states in\nnuclear systems, they have not been confirmed experimentally.\nTetrahedral shapes are invariant with respect to the trans-\nformations of the point group T Dd . In nuclei, they are realized\nat first-order through nonaxial octupole deformations of\nthe nuclear density corresponding to the intrinsic octupole\nmoment Q32 \u221d r3(Y32 + Y3\u22122). The key argument in favor of\nthe stability of tetrahedral shapes is a direct consequence of the\ntheory of point groups. The group T Dd possesses two two- and\none four-dimensional irreducible representation (irrep). The\nunusual (in the context of nuclear structure) family of fourfold\ndegenerate levels lead to a bunching of single-particle states\nresulting in rather large shell gaps and increased stability of\nspecific configurations [2,3,5].\nAmong the predicted \u201ctetrahedral magic\u201d numbers are the\nZ = 40 proton and N = 40, 56\u201358 neutron numbers [3]. The\nZr isotopes with 40 and 58 neutrons are thus predicted to be\ndoubly-magic with respect to this symmetry. However, these\nnuclei may also exhibit other types of octupole deformations:\nthe coupling between the neutron d5\/2 and h11\/2 orbitals\nand the proton p3\/2 and g9\/2 orbitals can lead to both axial\nand nonaxial octupole correlations [6]. Moreover, octupole\ndeformations are in competition with the quadrupole mode\nthat may obscure the signature of the tetrahedral symmetry.\nAlthough experimental data are rather poor for 80Zr, the\nrotational band built on the ground state suggests the presence\nof a large quadrupole deformation [7]. The evolution of shapes\nfor the Zr isotopes above the closed-shell nucleus 90Zr is\nrather complex. The low-energy spectrum of 96Zr exhibits\na pattern typical of a spherical nucleus, whereas 100\u2212104Zr\nhave very large quadrupole deformations in their ground\nstate together with coexisting low-lying oblate and spherical\nminima [8]. 98Zr lies at the border between these two regions\nand exhibits a transitional character, as demonstrated both\nexperimentally [9] and theoretically [8,10,11]. In particular,\nthe large experimental E0 transition between the first excited\n0+ state and the ground state suggests a strong mixing between\ncoexisting shapes. This nucleus appears thus to be particularly\nrich in terms of the different deformation modes that are\nin competition: spherical, oblate, prolate, tetrahedral, and\naxial-octupole shapes.\nThe purpose of the present article is to analyze for\nthe first time the role of tetrahedral configurations in the\ncollective excitations of these nuclei. It is organized as follows.\nFirst, we investigate the competition between axial and\ntetrahedral octupole shapes using the Skyrme Hartree-Fock+\nBCS (HFBCS) approach to probe the potential energy land-\nscape in the octupole directions. We then explore dynamical\neffects beyond mean-field, parity restoration, and quantum\nfluctuations to determine whether states with large tetrahedral\ncorrelations are present at low excitation energy and thus\nwhether there is a possibility to identify them experimentally.\nThis analysis, performed using the generator coordinate\nmethod [12](GCM), aims at paving the way to a more\ncomprehensive quantum treatment of all quadrupole and\noctupole degrees of freedom of the nuclear surface at the\nsame time. The method has already been applied to the study\nof the excitation modes of the superdeformed Hg and Pb\nisotopes [13].\nTo investigate the variation of the energy of nuclei as a\nfunction of several shape degrees of freedom, the Hartree-\nFock (HF) equations have been solved by discretization on a\nthree-dimensional mesh in coordinate space [14]. Contrary to\nthe usual way of solving mean-field equations in a truncated\noscillator basis, this technique has the advantage that it allows\ndescription of nuclear configurations with any kind of shape\nwith the same, high, numerical accuracy. In particular, this\nmethod has been used to describe nuclei from their spherical\n0556-2813\/2006\/74(5)\/051302(5) 051302-1 \u00a92006 The American Physical Society\nRAPID COMMUNICATIONS\nZBERECKI, MAGIERSKI, HEENEN, AND SCHUNCK PHYSICAL REVIEW C 74, 051302(R) (2006)\nground state up to fission with an accuracy of a few tenths of\nkeV on energy differences [14,15].\nBecause studying a nucleus as a function of several shape\ndegrees of freedom is computationally a heavy task, we have\nimposed a symmetry condition that simplifies the problem\nwhile retaining the main degrees of freedom relevant for a\nstudy of tetrahedral shapes. The mean-field density is required\nto be symmetric with respect to two mutually perpendicular\nplanes. Such a constraint reduces the complexity of the\nproblem four times but still allows study of the variation\nof the nuclear energy as a function of all octupole degrees\nof freedom, although odd-m and even-m modes cannot be\ntreated simultaneously [13]. The coupling between multipole\nmoments with even and odd m-values is beyond the scope of\nour study, which is focused on the tetrahedral mode. Note that\ndeformations corresponding to all multipole moments with\neven-m values, in particular triaxial quadrupole deformations\nare automatically taken into account by our method.\nWe have performed a full set of calculations with two\nparametrizations of the Skyrme interaction: SIII, which was\nused in previous studies of the Zr isotopes with the same\nmethod [11,16], and SLy4 [17]. The results that we present in\ndetails correspond to the SIII force. Both forces predict very\nsimilar behavior of the energy as a function of octupole degrees\nof freedom around the spherical configuration. However,\ntheir predictions for the energy as a function of the axial\nquadrupole moment are qualitatively different. The main\ndifference between both forces is that, at the mean-field level\nof approximation, the 80Zr ground state obtained with SLy4\nis spherical and the deformed configuration is excited by\n3\u20134 MeV, whereas for SIII the two configurations are almost\ndegenerate. Also the spherical configuration of 98Zr forms a\nlocal minimum with respect to the quadrupole deformation for\nSLy4 force, whereas it turns out to be unstable for SIII.\nThe pairing interaction has been treated in the BCS\napproximation including the Lipkin-Nogami (LN) correction\n[18]. A zero-range density-dependent pairing interaction has\nbeen used:\nVpair = 12gi(1 \u2212 P\u03c3 )\u03b4(r \u2212 r\n\u2032)\n[\n1 \u2212 \u03c1(r)\n\u03c10\n]\n, (1)\nwhere i = n, p for neutrons and protons, respectively. As in\nprevious applications, we set \u03c10 = 0.16 fm\u22123.\nThe strengths of the pairing force for both nuclei are listed in\nTable I together with pairing gaps \u00af\u0004i calculated as an average\nover the single-particle states within a 5-MeV window around\nthe Fermi level. These values reproduce the \u201cexperimental\u201d\npairing gaps \u0004, extracted from the odd-even mass staggering\nusing a three-point filter from Ref. [19]. Because there are\nlarge uncertainties in the experimental gaps, especially around\n80Zr, we have also performed calculations with reduced pairing\nTABLE I.

[20] that\ngive gaps twice smaller than the \u201cexperimental\u201d ones.\nThe HFBCS+LN calculations presented in Fig. 1 show the\nvariation of the energy as function of the axial quadrupole\nmoment. For 80Zr, the spherical and deformed configurations\nare almost degenerate, whereas for 98Zr, the SIII interaction\ndoes not predict a spherical minimum. However, calculations\nwith the SLy4 force give a shallow spherical minimum with\na depth of 200 keV. These differences between the two\nparametrizations are due to the transitional character of 98Zr,\nwhich makes the study of its quadrupole properties very\nsensitive to the details of the effective interaction.\nTo probe the octupole susceptibility of the spherical\nconfigurations, we have performed two sets of calculations\nalong the axial octupole path (Q32 was kept equal to zero)\nand the tetrahedral path (Q30 was kept equal to zero). In both\ncases, the quadrupole moment was constrained to zero. The\nresults are shown in Fig. 2. The octupole moments have been\nexpressed through the dimensionless deformation parameters\nusing the relation \u03b230 = \u3008Q30\u3009\/C0 , \u03b232 = \u3008Q32\u3009\/C2 , where\nC0 = 3\/4\u03c0A2r30 , C2 = C0\/\n\u221a\n2 with r0 = 1.2 fm. For each\noctupole mode, we have performed calculations with pairing\nswitched off and on. In the HF approximation, the spherical\nconfiguration is always unstable with respect to the octupole\nmodes. The energy gained by octupole deformations is around\n1 MeV for Y30 and is still larger for Y32, around 2 MeV for 80Zr\nand 3 MeV for 98Zr. This result is consistent with calculations\nperformed within the macroscopic-microscopic method with\na Woods-Saxon potential [3]. When pairing correlations are\ntaken into account, the effects of octupole correlations are\nstrongly reduced. For 98Zr the energy gain does not exceed\n1 MeV and for 80Zr the octupole minima even disappear\ncompletely. Nevertheless the susceptibility toward the Y32\nmode remains slightly larger than for the axial octupole mode.\nNote that octupole minima in 98Zr are saddle points. Very\nsimilar results concerning the tetrahedral instability of the\nspherical configuration of 80Zr have been found in Skyrme\n051302-2\nRAPID COMMUNICATIONS\nTETRAHEDRAL CORRELATIONS IN 80Zr AND 98Zr PHYSICAL REVIEW C 74, 051302(R) (2006)\n0\n2\n4\n6\nE \n(M\neV\n)\n0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3\n\u03b230, \u03b232\n-2\n0\n2\n4\nE \n(M\neV\n)\n80Zr\n98Zr\nFIG. 2.

The mechanism\nby which pairing correlations makes the tetrahedral minimum\nweaker is rather simple. In these nuclei, the single-particle\ngaps are not large in the spherical configuration and are\nincreased almost twice by tetrahedral deformations. As a\nresult, shell effects favor the creation of a tetrahedral minimum.\nHowever, the pairing interaction is the largest for the spherical\nconfiguration and is very small in the tetrahedral minimum,\nresulting in a flat potential energy curve.\nThis result shows that a static tetrahedral configuration\nmay appear only as a result of a delicate balance between\npairing and shell effects, which makes its prediction strongly\ndependent on the effective interaction that is used. Moreover\nshould there be a static tetrahedral minimum, it is likely to\nbe shallow and could be destroyed by dynamical correlations.\nOne must also emphasize that our mean-field calculations were\nperformed around the spherical configuration by constraining\nthe quadrupole moment to zero. The octupole minima that are\nobtained could therefore also be unstable against quadrupole\ndeformations. Yet, dynamical factors may also play in favor of\noctupole minima. In particular, when octupole correlations are\nincluded, the mean-field wave function breaks parity and parity\nprojection brings a correlation energy that favors octupole\ncorrelation, especially for negative-parity states. We will study\nthese effects in the next section to determine the stability\nof a tetrahedral state with respect to correlations beyond a\nmean-field approach.\nThe generator coordinate method (GCM) allows at the same\ntime to study the collective dynamics of a nucleus with respect\nto a collective variable and to restore the symmetries broken\nin a pure mean-field approach (see Ref. [12] and references\ntherein). It is perfectly suited to our goal, which is to determine\na possible influence of the tetrahedral mode on low-lying\ncollective states.\nThe information given by a mean-field potential energy\nsurface is of a purely static nature and one must go beyond\na mean-field approach to study its stability with respect to\nvibrations in the potential well. In cases where the energy\nsurface presents several coexisting minima separated by low\nbarriers, the very concept of a mean-field state with a specific\ndeformation may even break down. Correlations beyond\nmean-field lead then to states that represent a mixture of\nconfigurations with different deformations. All these effects\nare taken into account in the GCM approach.\nWe limit here the collective space to octupole modes against\nwhich 80Zr and 98Zr are very soft. It is clear that a full study of\nthese nuclei would require to include also quadrupole deforma-\ntions and to mix both octupole modes. Such multidimensional\nGCM calculations are feasible but represent a heavy task that\nis beyond the scope of this exploratory article. The purpose of\nthe present GCM calculations is limited to finding out whether\nthere is a chance to have a clear signature of the tetrahedral\nmode in the low-energy spectrum.\nWe have taken either Q30 or Q32 as generator coordinate.\nThe wave functions generated by the constrained mean-field\ncalculations were first projected on particle numbers and\nparity:\nE(N,Z, \u03b23\u00b5)\u00b1 = \u3008\u03c6(\u03b23\u00b5)|\n\u02c6H \u02c6P(\u00b1,N,Z)|\u03c6(\u03b23\u00b5)\u3009\n\u3008\u03c6(\u03b23\u00b5)| \u02c6P(\u00b1,N,Z)|\u03c6(\u03b23\u00b5)\u3009\n, (2)\nwhere |\u03c6(\u03b23\u00b5)\u3009 are HFBCS wave functions generated with\nthe constraint \u3008\u03c6(\u03b23\u00b5)| \u02c6Q3\u00b5|\u03c6(\u03b23\u00b5)\u3009 = C\u00b5\u03b23\u00b5. The operator\n\u02c6P(\u00b1,N,Z) is the product of operators projecting on \u03c0 = \u00b11\nparity and on N neutrons and Z protons. The parity-projected\nenergies are shown in the upper part of Fig. 3. As usual\nafter parity restoration [13] the energy minima for positive-\nparity states are shifted toward smaller octupole deformations\ncompared to the HFBCS minima (see Fig. 2), whereas the\nnegative-parity states have larger deformations. For both nuclei\nthe energy minima for positive parity correspond to very\nsimilar \u03b230 and \u03b232 values. For the negative-parity curve, \u03b232 is\nsystematically larger than \u03b230 in the minimum. Qualitatively\nsimilar results have been obtained with the SLy4 Skyrme\nparametrization.\nThe GCM allows to study the stability of the configurations,\ncorresponding to the minima of these energy curves, with re-\nspect to large amplitude vibrations. A collective wave function\nis constructed by mixing the mean-field states corresponding to\ndifferent values of the octupole moment, after their projection\non particle number and parity:\n|\b\u3009 =\n\u222b\nf (\u03b23\u00b5) \u02c6P(\u00b1,N,Z)|\u03c6(\u03b23\u00b5)\u3009d\u03b23\u00b5.

The same\neffective interactions as in the mean-field calculations are used.\nIn practice, the integral is replaced by a discrete summation\nover \u03b23\u00b5, with a number of points large enough to obtain\nresults independent of the discretization [12].

More\nsignificant are the differences obtained for the negative-parity\nstates whose excitations are lower by 300 keV. Qualitatively\nsimilar predictions are obtained with the SLy4 interaction.\nTo check the sensitivity of the GCM results on the\nmagnitude of pairing correlations, we performed calculations\nwith pairing strengths that produce gaps larger or smaller\nby a factor of 2. Qualitatively, the GCM results are not\naffected: the changes in the collective wave functions and\ndynamical deformations are marginal. The correlation energies\nvary by 10\u201320%. A doubling of the pairing gap results\nin approximately twice as large excitation energy for the\nnegative-parity states. We have found also that the results for\n98Zr are less sensitive to the pairing strength than those for\n80Zr.\nWe have studied two nuclei, 80Zr and 98Zr, which are\ndoubly magic with respect to the tetrahedral symmetry, to\nestablish whether they may serve as good candidates to obtain\nexperimental evidence of a stable tetrahedral deformation.\nOur results, based on the mean-field approach, indicate that\nthe spherical configuration of both nuclei is indeed unstable\nagainst octupole deformations. The presence of a tetrahedral\nminimum is the result of a delicate balance between shell\neffects and pairing. Due to the very shallow energy minima,\nquantum fluctuations beyond mean field play a significant role.\nTo quantify this role, we performed dynamical calculations\nusing the GCM in two octupole directions, specified by either\ntetrahedral or axial octupole deformations. The correlation\nenergies associated with the octupole collective modes are\nlarge in both cases and lower significantly the energy of the\nspherical configuration. These results seem to be qualitatively\nindependent of the Skyrme parametrization.\nWe performed the calculation in such conditions that each\nmode is clearly separated from the other, constraining in\nparticular the quadrupole deformations to be zero. Under these\nconditions it turns out that the correlation energies are slightly\nlarger for the tetrahedral mode than for the axial one. Also the\ntetrahedral vibration has smaller energy than the corresponding\nenergy of axial octupole collective mode. Hence it was shown\nthat, thanks to dynamical effects, the tetrahedral mode is\nenergetically more favorable as compared to the axial octupole\nmode. However, the possible mixture between these modes\ncannot be excluded.\nIn summary, our results suggest that both the axial and\ntetrahedral type of octupole correlations play an important role\nin these nuclei, and they possess very similar characteristics.\nDiscussions with J.
