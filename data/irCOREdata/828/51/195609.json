Here, we characterize one such interaction between endogenous receptors in human embryonic kidney 293 cells in which G\u03b1q\/11-coupled muscarinic M3 receptors facilitate Ca2+ signaling by G\u03b1s-coupled \u03b22-adrenoceptors. Measurement of changes in intracellular [Ca2+] demonstrated that noradrenaline released Ca2+ from thapsigargin-sensitive intracellular stores only during activation of muscarinic receptors. Agonists with low efficacy for muscarinic receptor-mediated Ca2+ responses facilitated cross-talk more effectively than full agonists. The cross-talk required G\u03b1s and was dependent upon intracellular Ca2+ release channels, particularly inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate receptors. However, \u03b22-adrenoceptor-mediated Ca2+ release was independent of measurable increases in phospholipase C activity and resistant to inhibitors of protein kinases A and C. Interestingly, single-cell imaging demonstrated that particularly lower concentrations of muscarinic receptor agonists facilitated marked oscillatory Ca2+ signaling to noradrenaline. Thus, activation of muscarinic M3 receptors profoundly influences the magnitude and oscillatory behavior of intracellular Ca2+ signaling by \u03b22-adrenoceptors.
