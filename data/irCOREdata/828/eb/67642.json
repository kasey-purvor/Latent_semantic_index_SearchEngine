The IMAGE satellite RPI\nexperiment provided in situ measurements of the electron number density in passing the\nequatorial region of the same field line,while the EUV Imager experimentwas able to resolve\nthe He+ abundance by looking back toward the same place a few hours later. On 22 January\n2001 all measurements were consistent with a moderately disturbed plasmasphere. On\n14 February 2001 there appeared to be a significant response of the plasmasphere to the\nmoderate (Kp = 5) activity levels. Both the electron number density and the mass density\ndetermined from the ground-based experiments were markedly higher than on 22 January\n2001. Also, the IMAGE RPI gave a markedly lower electron number density than did the\nground-based data; this is explained by differences in the longitude at which the\nmeasurements were made and the presence of localized plasmaspheric structures. At\nAntarctic Peninsula longitudes a He+ column abundance value of 6\u0001 1010 cm\u00022 is found to\nbe equivalent to plasmaspheric electron density levels of 3000 cm\u00023 at L = 2.5. For these\nconditions the He+ mass abundance was about 12\u201316% compared with H+. Both decreases\nand increases in the He+ column abundance measured by the EUV Imager appear to be\nlinearly correlated to changes in the percentage occurrence of He+ as determined from a\ncombination of ground-based VLF and ULF observations.

Introduction\n[2] It has previously been shown that the plasma mass\ndensity in the inner magnetosphere can be determined from\nthe interstation phase and amplitude spectra of geomagnetic\npulsations between pairs of ground-based magnetometers\n[Menk et al., 1999, 2000]. It is also well known that the\nplasmaspheric electron number density can be determined\nby analysing the propagation of ducted man-made whistler-\nmode signals [Clilverd et al., 2000]. Both of these measure-\nments tend to be single point, or at least single longitude.\nThe pulsations are essentially a daytime probe, while the\nwhistler-mode signals are more often observed during\nnighttime. Good spatial information on the structure of the\ninner magnetosphere can be obtained using satellite-based\nexperiments, although the measurement repetition rate tends\nto be low.\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 108, NO.

The images are necessarily line-of-sight\nand require a degree of interpretation to deconvolve the\nmultilayered information. Crucially, information on the ion\ncomposition of the inner magnetosphere is necessary to\naccurately interpret the images during varying periods of\ngeomagnetic activity levels.\n[4] Dent et al. [2003] compared magnetometer\/VLF\/\nImage RPI measurements made at different latitudes and\nlongitudes for one specific time. In this study we provide\nthe first analysis of data that describes the structure of the\ninner magnetosphere using all of these techniques, i.e.,\npulsations, ducted whistler-mode signals, and in situ satel-\nlite measurements, observing the same point on a geomag-\nnetic field-line and at the same longitude. We discuss two\nrepresentative days and show that the plasma number\ndensity results determined from the different techniques\nare consistent, and can be used to intercalibrate the EUV\nImager images produced by the IMAGE satellite. A coupled\nplasmasphere-ionosphere model is compared against the\nobservations as a further intercalibration.\n2. Experimental Details\n2.1. Magnetometer Observations\n[5] In order to monitor the plasma mass density at L =\n2.5, we examined ULF geomagnetic field line resonances\n(FLRs) during January and February 2001 using a combi-\nnation of ground magnetometer arrays. The primary mag-\nnetic data were obtained with an array of 3 Low-Powered\nMagnetometers (LPMs) deployed and operated by the\nBritish Antarctic Survey since December 2000 specifically\nfor this project. Figure 1 shows the locations of these\nclosely spaced stations located on the Antarctic Peninsula\nand spanning 2.3 < L < 2.8 (63\u0001S\u201368\u0001S and 63\u0001\u201368\u0001W\ngeographic). Their relative locations are indicated by labels\nM1, M2, and M3.\n[6] Each LPM is an autonomous three-component flux-\ngate magnetometer system developed for remote operation\nin temperatures down to \u000270\u0001C, in an environment of\nextreme gales and high static discharge hazard. The systems\nuse GPS timing, solar panels, and rechargable batteries, and\nthey conserve power by switching the sensors off between\nsamples. Each system is visited just once per year to\ndownload data. The LPM data were sampled in geographic\ncoordinates at 0.1 Hz (averaged from the 5 s measurements)\nwith <1 nT resolution, and rotated into geomagnetic (H, D)\ncoordinates before analysis.\n[7] An additional magnetometer at the Ukranian Antarc-\ntic station Vernadsky (65\u0001S, 64\u0001W; see Figure 1) provided\ndata from close to the midpoint of two of the LPM systems.\nThis comprises a three-component LEMI-008 type fluxgate\nmagnetometer that samples the geomagnetic field each 1 s\nwith 0.1 nT resolution. This magnetometer has transmitted\nits data to the British Geological Survey INTERMAGNET\nproject since February 2001.\n[8] Additional information on the variation of resonant\nfrequency (and hence mass density) with latitude was\nobtained using data from the combined SAMNET and\nBGS magnetometer arrays obtained from the University of\nYork, UK. For this purpose 5 s measurements with <0.1 nT\nresolution were examined from 7 SAMNET\/BGS magne-\ntometer stations spanning L = 2.24 to L = 5.47 between 0\u0001W\nand 21\u0001W geographic longitude.\n[9] Techniques for the detection of FLRs were summa-\nrized by Menk et al. [1999, 2000]. When examining data\nfrom latitudinally separated magnetometers, the resonant\nfrequency is identified by the peak in H-component cross-\npower and cross-phase, and a unity crossing in H-compo-\nnent power ratio, approximately midway between the\nstations. Where only one station is available the resonance\nis indicated by a peak in the power ratio H\/D and a rapid\nchange in polarization, i.e., in the phase between the H and\nD components.\n[10] The diurnal pattern of resonance behavior is most\nclearly seen with dynamic cross-phase spectra [e.g., Waters\net al., 1991, 1995]. However, all measurements of resonant\nfrequency in this paper were obtained from inspection of\ndiscrete FFT cross-power, coherence, power difference,\npower ratio, and cross-phase spectra on selected days over\ntime windows between 30 and 60 min long, the shorter\nwindows being used under more active conditions.\n[11] Mass densities were calculated from the measured\nresonant frequencies using the analytical expressions\ndescribed by Taylor and Walker [1984] and Walker et al.\n[1992]. These assume decoupled toroidal mode oscillations\nand yield essentially identical results to the models\ndescribed by Orr and Matthew [1971]. We used a model\ndistribution of the form R\u00023, where R is the radial distance\nin the equatorial plane, since this is where the magnetic field\nstrength, and hence Alfve\u00b4n velocity along a field line\ngenerally reach a minimum. This is invalid for very low\nor high latitude field lines because of mass loading by\nionospheric heavy ions and field line distortion, but it is a\nsatisfactory approximation at L = 2.5. The choice of power\nlaw describing the radial variation in density within the\nFigure 1. Map of the Antarctic Peninsula showing the\ngeographic positions of the low-power magnetometer sites\n(M1, M2, M3), Vernadsky magnetometer (diamond), the\nVLF Doppler receiver site (asterisk), and the typical field\nline footprint of study (cross).\nSMP 5 - 2 CLILVERD ET AL.: INTERCALIBRATION MEASUREMENTS OF PLASMASPHERIC DENSITY\nplasmasphere has been discussed by, e.g., Menk et al.\n[1999] and Denton et al. [2001], although the calculated\nmass density is relatively insensitive to the actual power law\n[Orr and Matthew, 1971; Walker et al., 1992].\n[12] The uncertainty in our calculated mass densities\n(20\u201330%) depends mainly on uncertainty in the frequency\nmeasurement with uncertainties typically of order 10\u201315%.\nMenk et al. [1999] discussed the relationship between these\ntwo uncertainties and found the mass density uncertainty to\nbe typically double the uncertainty in frequency measure-\nment. We have assumed a dipole magnetic field, and at\nL = 2.5 this introduces negligible error. The equatorial mass\ndensity can also be determined from comparison of reso-\nnance harmonics [Schulz, 1996]. That method requires\nobserved frequencies to be accurate to 6% in order to obtain\nequatorial mass density with a precision of 30% [Denton\nand Gallagher, 2000]. The guided poloidal mode eigenfre-\nquency is \u000330% lower than our assumed purely toroidal\nmode oscillations so that wave mode coupling may cause\nthe mass density to be slightly underestimated.\n2.2. VLF Data\n[13] Equatorial electron number densities (Neq) were\nestimated for L = 2.5 using man-made VLF whistler-mode\nsignals recorded at Rothera in Antarctica (geographic\n67.5\u0001S, 68.1\u0001W, L = 2.8). The VLF Doppler experiment\nat Rothera receives ducted whistler-mode signals from the\neast coast U.S. Navy transmitter NAA, 24.0 kHz, 1 MW at\nCutler, Maine (geographic 44.6\u0001N, 67.3\u0001W, L = 3.0).\nNarrowband receivers of the type described by Thomson\n[1981] are able to separate the whistler mode signals from\nthe stronger subionospheric signal and measure the group\ndelays (tg), Doppler shifts, and arrival bearings of the\nwhistler mode component. Results from these experiments\nhave been published by Saxton and Smith [1989] and\nClilverd et al. [2000].\n[14] The method of determining the group delays, L\nshells, and propagation paths of the whistler mode signals\nwas discussed in detail by Smith and Clilverd [1991] and\nClilverd et al. [1991]. The group delay times of the whistler\nmode signals are determined by cross correlating the plas-\nmaspheric signal with the subionospheric signal, accummu-\nlating the coefficicents for 15 min at a time. The L shell has\nin the past been determined by measuring the difference in\ngroup delay time for two different transmitter frequencies\ntraveling in the same duct. The time difference is due to\ndispersion along the field line and is dependent on the L\nshell of propagation. In this study we use the simplification\nthat the average group delay observed is representative of\nequatorial electron number density conditions at L = 2.5.\nThe error incurred by using this simplification is \u00030.1 L\n[Saxton and Smith, 1989]. As the longitude of the transmit-\nter and the receiver are so similar the whistler-mode signals\nexit the ionosphere close to the Antarctic Peninsula LPM\narray. The intercomparison between this technique and\nFLRs has been discussed by Menk et al. [1999] and Dent\net al. [2003].\n2.3. IMAGE Satellite Data\n[15] The IMAGE spacecraft is in an elliptical polar orbit\nwith an apogee altitude of 7.2 Earth radii (46,000 km) and\na perigee altitude of 1000 km, and completes one orbit\nevery 14.2 hours. This study presents data from two of\nthe seven instruments on board the spacecraft. The RPI\nexperiment provides the electron number density as\nIMAGE transits through the plasmasphere, and the EUV\nImager experiment images geospace using He+ emissions\nwhen the spacecraft is near apogee looking back toward\nthe Earth.\n[16] The RPI instrument [Reinisch et al., 2000; Carpenter\net al., 2002] is a low-power radar which operates in the\nradio frequency bands which contain the plasma resonance\nfrequencies characteristic of the Earth\u2019s magnetophere\n(3 kHz to 3 MHz). In the passive receive-only mode, RPI\nreceives the natural plasma wave emissions from 3 kHz to\n1.1 MHz, using these to determine the electron number\ndensity to within an accuracy of 10%. In this study we are\nable to make use of the fact that the orbit of IMAGE takes it\nclose to the geomagnetic equator at \u0003L = 2.5 so that there is\nno adjustment to make in order to compare the RPI\nmeasurements with the VLF Doppler electron number\ndensity estimates.\n[17] The Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUV Imager)\nimages the distribution of He+ in Earth\u2019s plasmasphere by\ndetecting its resonantly scattered emission at 30.4 nm\n[Sandel et al., 2001]. Effective imaging of the plasma-\nspheric He+ requires global snapshots in which the high\napogee and the wide field of view of the EUV Imager\nprovide in a single exposure a map of the entire plasma-\nsphere. The 30.4 nm feature is relatively easy to measure\nbecause it is the brightest ion emission from the plasma-\nsphere, it is spectrally isolated, and the background at that\nwavelength is negligible. Line-of-sight measurements are\neasy to interpret because the plasmaspheric He+ emission is\noptically thin, so its brightness is directly proportional to the\nHe+ column abundance. The EUV Imager instrument con-\nsists of three identical sensor heads, each having a field of\nview of 30\u0001. These sensors are tilted relative to one another\nto cover a fan-shaped field of 84\u0001 \u0001 30\u0001, which is swept\nacross the plasmasphere by the spin of the satellite. EUV\nImager\u2019s spatial resolution is \u00030.6\u0001 or \u00030.1 RE in the\nequatorial plane seen from apogee. The sensitivity is suffi-\ncient to map the position of the plasmapause with a time\nresolution of 10 min or better.\n2.4. Plasmasphere-Ionosphere Model\n[18] We compare the measured densities with modeled\nvalues of electron and ion number densities in the equatorial\nregion of the L = 2.5 field-line at Antarctic Peninsula\nlongitudes. These have been determined from SUPIM,\nthe Sheffield University Plasmasphere Ionosphere Model\n[Bailey and Selleck, 1990; Bailey et al., 1993; Bailey and\nBalan, 1995]. In SUPIM, coupled time-dependent equations\nof continuity, momentum, and energy balance are solved\nalong closed magnetic field lines between altitudes of around\n120 km in conjugate hemispheres for the concentrations,\nfield-aligned fluxes, and temperatures of the O+, H+, He+,\nN2\n+, O2\n+, and NO+ ions and the electrons. For the present\nstudy the geomagnetic field is represented by an eccentric\ndipole. The concentrations and temperatures of the neutral\ngases are obtained from the MSIS86 thermospheric model\n[Hedin, 1987], the neutral wind velocities from the HWM90\nneutral wind model [Hedin et al., 1991], and the solar EUV\nfluxes from the EUVAC solar EUV flux model of Richards\nCLILVERD ET AL.: INTERCALIBRATION MEASUREMENTS OF PLASMASPHERIC DENSITY SMP 5 - 3\net al. [1994]. The remaining model inputs, such as the\nphotoionization and photoabsorption cross sections, the\nchemical reaction rates, the heating and cooling rates, and\nthe collision frequencies are described by Bailey and Selleck\n[1990], Bailey et al. [1993], and Bailey and Balan [1995].\n3. Results\n3.1. Overview\n[19] The low-power magnetometers were deployed in\nAntarctica and commenced data recording in December\n2000 and have operated continuously since then. The VLF\nDoppler experiment has been operating concurrently. This\npaper presents results from 2 days of data from the first\nsummer of operation, through to early March 2001. Geo-\nmagnetic conditions during this time were relatively quiet,\nwith no significant magnetic storms. The two days selected\nfor detailed study, 22 January and 14 February 2001, are two\nof the more disturbed periods during this time, when the\noccurrence of ducted VLF signals and ULF pulsation activ-\nity is likely to peak. To assess this, we examined (1) monthly\nscatter plots of the group delay of NAAVLF Doppler signals\nreceived at Rothera, (2) monthly scatter plots of the local\ntime distribution of these Doppler signals, and (3) time series\nrecords from the colocated magnetometers.\n[20] On the first day examined, 22 January, Kp reached\n4- after peaking the previous day at 40. Ap reached 19 on\n21 January, again indicative of moderately disturbed\nconditions, while the previous 10 days had registered a\nmaximum of only 9. The maximum Kp on the second\nselected day, 14 February, was again 4-, after peaking at\n5- just before midnight on 13 February. Ap reached 25 on\n13 February, again indicative of moderately disturbed con-\nditions, while the previous 10 days had registered a max-\nimum of 14 on 6 February. The sunspot number on\n22 January was 93 while for 14 February it was 68. Thus\nboth selected days represent moderately disturbed condi-\ntions, occurring after an extended quiet period.\n[21] The RPI electron number density data can also\nprovide information on the state of the plasmasphere during\nthese days. Figure 2 shows the scaled plasma wave results\nfor passes through the plasmasphere made at about 0800\u2013\n1100 UT on both study days (dotted and dash-dot lines),\npulsation FLR results from the U.K. SAMNET array (solid\nlines), and the empirical model results of Carpenter and\nAnderson [1992] (dashed lines). The RPI results include\nextrapolations from the point of measurement to the geo-\nmagnetic equatorial plane at each L-shell. This is done by\nsimply assuming the density along a field line is uniform\nover the small range of L-shells considered here where the\nsatellite is close to the geomagnetic equator [Goldstein et\nal., 2001]. Also included in the figures are mass densities\nand electron densities derived from the LPMs and VLF\nexperiments near L = 2.5 on the Antarctic Peninsula (open\ncircles and filled triangles, respectively). For the 22 January\nplot, uncertainty in the ULF-derived mass density is\nindicated by error bars. For clarity these have not been\nshown in the 14 February plot, although the uncertainties\nare similar.\n[22] The 22 January data (top panel) are best represented\nby an extended plasmapause about 0.5 L wide situated\nsomewhere near L = 3.8. The IMAGE spacecraft pass is\nfrom 0802 to 0845 UT and 0438 to 0502 MLT. The model\nand RPI electron densities are similar around L = 2.5\u20133.3\neven though there is little overall agreement throughout the\nplasmasphere. Beyond L = 4.3 the RPI density extrapola-\ntions become unreliable as the spacecraft ascends to >20\u0001\nlatitude above the equatorial plane.\n[23] The plasma mass density (solid line) was deter-\nmined between 0800 and 0840 UT for a range of L-values\nusing SAMNET and BGS magnetometer data at about 0\u0001\nFigure 2. Variation of plasma density through the\nmagnetosphere near 1000 UT on 22 January (top panel)\nand 14 February 2001 (bottom panel). IMAGE RPI electron\ndensities are indicated by the dotted line (0800 UT on\n22 January and 0900 UT on 14 February) and dash-dot line\n(1100 UT on 14 February). Ion mass densities determined\nusing the SAMNET\/BGS magnetometer arrays are denoted\nby the solid line (0800\u20130850 UT on 22 January and 0600\u2013\n0650 UT on 14 February) and heavy solid line (0800\u2013\n0850 UT on 14 February). The dashed line in both plots\nrepresents the empirical model of Carpenter and Anderson\n[1992] for these geomagnetic conditions. Finally, open\ncircles and solid triangles indicate L = 2.5 ion mass density\nand electron density at the Antarctic Peninsula.\nSMP 5 - 4 CLILVERD ET AL.: INTERCALIBRATION MEASUREMENTS OF PLASMASPHERIC DENSITY\ngeographic longitude. There is good overall agreement\nbetween the RPI experiment at 70\u0001W geographic longitude\nand the mass density values, although the mass densities\ntend to be slightly lower. This is primarily because of the\ninfluence, at this time of year, of the longitudinal ampli-\ntude of the annual variation in plasmaspheric electron\nnumber densities [Clilverd et al., 1991]. At longitudes of\nthe Antarctic Peninsula (60\u201370\u0001W geographic), high con-\ncentrations of ion and electrons would be expected in\nJanuary compared with those in June, while at the longi-\ntudes of Europe, Africa, and India such high concentra-\ntions would not be expected in January.\n[24] On 14 February (bottom panel) a reasonably well-\ndefined plasmapause is present in the IMAGE RPI measure-\nments. Data from two orbits are shown in the figure: 0901\u2013\n1018UT (1516\u20131504MLT; dotted line), and 1101\u20131157UT\n(0349\u20130293 MLT; dot-dash line). The plasmapause location\nis around L = 2.97\u20133.12 and L = 3.22\u20133.5 during these\npasses. Ionmass density data determined from the SAMNET\/\nBGS magnetometer array are also shown for two times:\n0600\u20130650 UT (solid line) and 0800\u20130850 UT (heavy line).\nThere are significant differences in the shape and position of\nthe plasmapause derived from the measurements at these\ntimes. This suggests that there are temporal and longitudinal\nvariations in both electron density and heavy ion concentra-\ntion during this day.\n[25] Again, the L = 2.5 ion mass density and electron\ndensity measurements are somewhat higher than values at\nother longitudes because of the longitudinal amplitude of\nthe annual variation in plasmaspheric number density. Note\nthat at L < 2.7 the ion mass densities are also significantly\nhigher than the RPI and model electron densities. In the case\nof the model values this is because of the lack of any annual\nvariation effects.\n[26] Clearly, when comparing the results from a range of\ninstruments it is important to consider their relative loca-\ntions. This paper uses data from longitudes in the Antarctic\nPeninsula region. On 22 January 2001 IMAGE passes the\ngeomagnetic equator near L = 2.5 between 290 and 310\u0001E\ngeographic. Thus the ground-based and satellite measure-\nments are closely colocated. On 14 February 2001 IMAGE\npasses the geomagnetic equator near L = 2.5 at about 240\u0001E\n(geographic) or 50\u0001 west of the Antarctic Peninsula region\nwhere the ground-based measurements are made. Although\nstill in the same longitudinal region in terms of the likely\ninfluence of the annual variation in plasma density at L = 2.5\nthe difference may still be significant as further analysis\nshows.\n3.2. 22 January 2001\n[27] The ground-based Antarctic Peninsula magnetometer\ndata come from a region centered on the Ukrainian Station\nof Vernadsky. The determination of the magnetospheric\nplasma mass density distribution is dependent on the\npresence of field-line resonances in the ULF data. Repre-\nsentative magnetometer time series from 0600\u20131200 UT\nfrom Vernadsky are shown in Figure 3, where six 1-hour\nsections of data are stacked vertically. The amplitude scale\nis 2 nT and is shown on the left hand y-axis. The plot shows\nthat small but discernable pulsations occur at most times,\nallowing good UT coverage for the mass density analysis.\nThis is expected for moderately disturbed geomagentic\nconditions and was a primary influence on the dates selected\nin this study.\n[28] The diurnal variation in magnetospheric plasma mass\ndensity near the equatorial plane at L = 2.5 on 22 January\n2001 is shown by the open circles with error bars in\nFigure 4. The average mass density is close to 3000\namu cm\u00023 for most of the day, although slightly lower\nvalues occur during the nighttime hours before 0800 UT\n(0400 LT). Reasonable data coverage extends until around\n1700 UT when pulsation activity became weaker. Also\nFigure 3. An example of the Vernadsky magnetometer data on 22 January, 0600\u20131200 UT, showing\nsmall pulsations of about 1 nT amplitude.\nCLILVERD ET AL.: INTERCALIBRATION MEASUREMENTS OF PLASMASPHERIC DENSITY SMP 5 - 5\nshown on Figure 4 are the electron number densities,\nderived by both the VLF Doppler experiment (filled\ntriangles with error bars) and the RPI experiment (filled\nsquares with error bars). These show a reasonable corre-\nlation with the mass densities during the first half of the\nday, when VLF data were available.\n[29] Figure 4 also shows results from the SUPIM\nmodel at the geomagnetic equator of the L = 2.5 field-\nline based on the solar and geomagentic conditions for\nthis day. The model starts from arbitary initial conditions\nand then runs for several calculation days until the output\nvalues converge. The dashed line indicates the diurnal\nvariation of the model electron number density, which\nshows good agreement with the equivalent VLF values\nduring the nighttime (0000\u20130700 UT). The solid line\nindicates the plasma mass density, which also shows\nreasonable agreement with the ULF observations during\nthe first third of the day, and a similar diurnal range.\nHowever, the phase of the model variation is offset from\nthat of the observations by 4\u20135 hours. The difference\nbetween the model electron density and model mass\ndensity results is due to the presence of heavy ion\npopulations in the model. During the day the proportion\nof He+ to H+ in the model is about 2.6% by number and\n10.5% by mass, while O+ increases from 0.7% to 1.0%\nby number or 11\u201316% by mass.\n[30] Figure 5 is an EUV Imager image from 22 January\n2001. It is the sum of eight individual EUV Imager images\nthat have been rebinned in L-shell and magnetic longitude\nspace [Sandel et al., 2003] and then added. Thus the\nbrightness of this image represents the He+ distribution in\nthe plane of the magnetic equator. The innermost white\ncircle corresponds to the solid Earth. Auroral emission is\npresent about half-way from the center to the Earth\u2019s limb\nbetween magnetic longitudes of approximately 0 and 180\u0001.\nEarth\u2019s shadow moves in magnetic longitude, so it is\nsmeared by summing the rebinned images. The position\nof the field-line at L = 2.5, magnetic longitude = 10\u0001E\n(shown by the white circle to the right of the Earth) is\noutside the shadow for all the images used in this work, so\nour determination of He+ column abundances is not com-\npromised. We used this type of plot to determine the line-of-\nsight He+ abundance for the line of sight at the white circle\nand found a value of 5.8 \u0001 1010 cm\u00022.\n3.3. 14 February 2001\n[31] The magnetospheric plasma mass density distribu-\ntion near L = 2.5 on 14 February 2001 is represented by the\nopen circles in Figure 6. The plot format is the same as\nFigure 4 for 22 January. It is noticeable, however, that on\n14 February the mass densities are somewhat higher, at\nabout 4500 a.m.u. cm\u00023, but the electron number densities\ndetermined from the VLF Doppler experiment still track\nthe mass densities. However, the RPI \u2018snapshot\u2019 values\n(2200 el. cm\u00023) are significantly lower, by a factor of 2\naround 1000 UT. As mentioned previously, near 0900 UT\nand 1100 UT the IMAGE satellite was respectively about\n150\u0001 east and 50\u0001 west of the ground stations, and this may\nFigure 4.

Error estimates for each observation are indicated\nby the vertical lines and are typically 10%.\nFigure 5. EUV Imager view of the near-Earth environ-\nment on 22 January 2001. This composite includes eight\nindividual EUV images acquired from 0051 to 0202 UT,\nwhen IMAGE was at magnetic latitudes from 77\u0001N to 68\u0001N\nand radial distances from 8.11 to 7.90 Re. The image is\nprojected into the plane of the magnetic equator, and the\nwhite grid shows L and magnetic longitude, with 0\u0001\nmagnetic longitude to the right. The white circle is at the\nposition of the Antarctic Peninsula L = 2.5 field-line. The\ndark mask over the lower parts of the image marks regions\nof incomplete coverage or scattered sunlight.\nSMP 5 - 6 CLILVERD ET AL.: INTERCALIBRATION MEASUREMENTS OF PLASMASPHERIC DENSITY\nbe why the in situ observations are significantly different\nfrom the other experiments. Analysis of naturally occurring\nwhistlers propagating at about 320\u0001E geographic longitude\nconfirms electron number densities of 4000 el. cm\u00023 at L =\n2.5, while estimates from a second VLF Doppler system in\nDunedin, New Zealand [Thomson, 1981] also agree with the\nhigh electron values observed on this day.\n[32] Figure 6 also shows results from the SUPIM model\nat the geomagnetic equator of the L = 2.5 field line based on\nthe solar and geomagnetic conditions for this day. The\ndashed line again indicates the diurnal variation of the\nmodel electron number density, which shows good agree-\nment with the equivalent VLF values prior to 0800 UT. The\nsolid line indicates the plasma mass density, which also\nshows good agreement with the ULF observations, espe-\ncially during the first half of the day. A significant differ-\nence between this model run and the one undertaken for\n22 January 2001 above is that the photoionization rate used\nfor 22 January was artificially made half as large in order to\nproduce similar density results to those observed. The\nphotoionization rate used on 14 February was typical for\nstandard model runs, while those for 22 January represent\nlower than normal rates. It is unclear how the difference in\nphotoionization rate between the two days is driven phys-\nically. The percentage of He+ to H+ in the model for\n14 February is again about 2.6% by number and 10.5%\nby mass, while O+ increases throughout the day from 0.7%\nto 1.0% by number or 11\u201316% by mass.\n[33] The EUV Imager data for 14 February were analyzed\nwhen IMAGE was close to apogee on two orbits. The first\nmeasurements at L = 2.5 were made between 2344 (the\nprevious day) and 0126 UT and gave an average column\nabundance of 6.7 \u0001 1010 cm\u00022. The second period was\nduring 2142\u20132213 UT, where the column abundance was\n11.0 \u0001 1010 cm\u00022. This second period appears to be\nassociated with a tongue of more intense He+ emission as\nshown in Figure 7, where the location of the geomagnetic\nequator at L = 2.5 at the longitude of study in this paper is\nindicated by the white circle. Compared with the model\nvalues the ULF mass densities do not appear to show any\nevidence of such a significant increase during the period\naround 2100 UT. However, compared with the VLF elec-\ntron number densities observed at 2300 UT significant\nlevels of heavy ions could be likely.\n4. Discussion\n[34] In previous studies of the ion and electron structure\nof the plasmasphere, Menk et al. [1999] and F. W. Menk\net al. (Monitoring the plasmapause using geomagnetic\npulsations: 1. Field line resonances, submitted to Journal\nof Geophysical Research, 2003). used spatially separated\nmeasurements, correcting for local time effects in order to\nintercompare the results. In this study we show the advan-\ntage of using colocated instruments in that no corrections\nneed to be made in order to compare the results.\n[35] Here we have chosen 2 days with similar geomag-\nnetic conditions, where the IMAGE satellite passed close to\nthe equatorial region of an L = 2.5 field-line connecting to a\ncluster of ground-based experiments measuring similar\nparameters. While the 2 study days seem to relate to similar\nconditions within the inner plasmasphere, the outer plasma-\nsphere (taken to be L > 3.0 here) is quite different on the\n2 days, with more structure and a well defined plasmapause\npresent on 14 February 2001. This may be due to different\nFigure 6. Ion mass density and electron density on\n14 February 2001, in the same format as Figure 4.\nFigure 7.

The solar wind speed was almost\nconstant around 320 km s\u00021 over most of 20\u201321 January\n2001, reaching a plateau around 500 km s\u00021 on 22 January.\nThe solar wind speed was in the range 400\u2013450 km s\u00021 on\n12 February but was in the range 480\u2013610 km s\u00021 on\n13 February and 14. The solar wind proton density was\nbetween 2 and 20 cm\u00023 over 20\u201322 January, with a short\nlarge increase to 60 cm\u00023 late on 21 January. Over 12\u2013\n13 February the solar wind proton density was generally\nbetween 5 and 10 cm\u00023 and <6 cm\u00023 on 14 February. Thus\nsolar wind pressure (which is proportional to nV2) was\nsignificantly higher over 12\u201313 February than over 20\u2013\n21 January. This may also explain why double the photoion-\nization rates were required in the SUPIM model to reproduce\nthe ground-based observations on 14 February compared\nwith 20 January. The IMF Bz component was similar during\nboth 20\u201321 January and 12\u201313 February, with positive\nvariations and several excursions to below \u00027 nT.\n[36] Using the EUV Imager experiment on IMAGE, we\nfind that the column abundance of He+ changed from 5.8\nto 6.7 \u0001 1010 cm\u00022 between 22 January and 14 February.\nThis is in qualitative agreement with the observed change\nin general plasma concentration between the 2 days. More\ngenerally, it appears that a typical value of 6 \u0001 1010 cm\u00022\nis appropriate for comparison with the ground-base obser-\nvations. We used this value to investigate the unexpectedly\nlower electron number density values on 14 February\nwhen IMAGE was 50\u0001 west of the ground stations.\nEUV Imager values from that region made at 1300\u2013\n1400 UT indicate column abundances of only 3.6 \u0001\n1010 cm\u00022, which is suggestive of a region of plasma\ndepletion that may have been present during this period\nand that could explain the IMAGE RPI values determined\nonly 3 hours earlier.\n[37] The ratio of He+ to H+ ions in the plasmasphere can\nbe described from an empirical expression given by Craven\net al. [1997]. The ratio decreases with radial distance and\ndepends on the solar activity 10.7 cm flux. At L = 2.5 the\ntypical mass ratio of He+:H+ is about 0.1, with a range from\n0.03 to 0.3. The solar flux measure F10.7 was typically\nabout 150 during January\/February, which Craven et al.\n[1997] suggests should result in the abundance of He+:H+\nbeing 10% at L = 2.5. Using the values of electron number\ndensity and ion mass density from 0800 UT on 22 January\n2001 and assuming charge neutrality, we find that He+ is\nabout 3.8% of the abundance of H+. Similar constraints on\nthe values determined from 0400 UT on 14 February 2001,\nwhen the electron number density is generally higher on this\nday than on 22 January (4000 el. cm\u00023 compared with\n3000 el. cm\u00023), gives He+ abundance levels of about 3.3%\nby number and about 13\u201314% by mass. However, the\nestimated number density of He+ atoms actually increases\nfrom 110 to 130 cm\u00023, or a ratio of about 1.2. From the\nEUV Imager images we know that the abundance of He+ on\nthe first half of these two days also shows a similar increase\n(6.7\/5.8 = 1.2).\n[38] Having determined the typical column abundance\nfigure for L = 2.5 can we relate this to the concentration\nvalues that we find in the equatorial region? Comparison\nbetween space-based and ground-based systems are reason-\nable when the plasma is distributed symmetrically and\nuniformly about the geomagnetic equator. Tu et al. [2003]\nshowed that this was the case. Modeling also shows that the\nmeasured radial profiles of He+ column density near L = 2.5\nare similar in shape to those computed by integrating the\nRPI electron density profiles such as those shown in\nFigure 2 [Sandel et al., 2003]. This implies that we can\ntake the L-dependence for He+ near L = 2.5 to be the same\nas that measured for electrons by RPI. We can then use the\nprofiles of electron density measured by RPI to compute an\neffective path length (P). Here P is the length of the column\nof He+ having uniform density equal to the region of\nmaximum, i.e., equatorial, density along the line of sight,\nand having the measured column density. For the plasma\ndistributions seen near L = 2.5, we find P = 1.8 Re. Then the\nmeasured column density corresponds to an equatorial\nconcentration of 52 He+ cm\u00023 in this region. With H+ levels\nclose to the electron number density of about 3000 el. cm\u00023\nwe find that this would result in He+ occurrence levels of\n1.7% by number and 6.9% by mass. As the VLF and ULF\nmeasurements are biased to about 10% of the length of the\nmagnetic field line that lies near the equatorial plane (0.5 RE\nfor an L = 2.5 field-line) we could probably multiply the\nabove intercomparison result by a factor of 2 (a value\nsuggested by Sandel et al. [2003]) to allow for the differ-\nence in effective path length, i.e., 1.8 Re to 0.5 Re. As a\nresult we might expect about 3\u20134% He+ by number and\n10\u201315% by mass from these calculations. Although further\nmodeling will be required to complete this picture in detail\nit does appear that this simple calculation confirms the\nanalysis made from the ground-based observations.\n[39] At 2200 UT on 14 February the IMAGE EUV\nImager measurements suggest that the abundance of He+\nexceeded the values that were observed on 22 January by\nalmost a factor of 2, i.e., 11 instead of 6 \u0001 1010 cm\u00022.\nAlthough data on the electron number densities are sparse at\nthis time, the disparity between the ULF mass densities and\nthe VLF electron number densities between 2000 and\n2300 UT shown in Figure 6 suggests that heavy ions must\nbe an influence. Once again requiring charge neutrality we\nfind that the 2000\u20132300 UT observations are consistent\nwith He+ being about 20% of H+ by number, with the actual\nlevels being about 540 cm\u00023. As a ratio of the values earlier\nin the day this is 540\/130 = 4.9, which is significantly\nhigher than the ratio of the equivalent column abundances,\ni.e., 11\/6.7 = 1.6. A near doubling of just He+ in the tongue\nof emission visible at 2100 UT would not be enough to\nproduce the majority of the change in mass density levels to\nabove 5000 a.m.u cm\u00023 observed at about 2100 UT. This\nsuggests the presence of heavier ions such as O+. Further\nexamples will need to be studied in order to clarify the\nrelationship between ions and electrons in this type of\nfeature.\n[40] With some confidence in intercomparing the EUV\nImager and ground-based experiments we can now consider\nthe relevance of the EUV Imager observations made at the\nlocation where the RPI measurements were significantly\nlower than the ground station observations on 14 February.\nEUV Imager levels of 3.6 \u0001 1010 cm\u00022 are a factor of about\n3.6\/6.7 = 0.53 down on the Antarctic Peninsula values.\nAs we estimated that electron number densities there\nwere 4000 el. cm\u00023 we would estimate RPI values of\n2150 el. cm\u00023 to the west. Clearly, this value equates well\nto the observed RPI value of 2200 el. cm\u00023 made at about\nSMP 5 - 8 CLILVERD ET AL.: INTERCALIBRATION MEASUREMENTS OF PLASMASPHERIC DENSITY\n1100 UT and confirms the presence of significant depletion\nstructures in the plasmasphere on this day.\n5. Conclusions\n[41] Using two ground-based experiments and two satel-\nlite-borne experiments, we have been able to interpret\nchanges in plasmaspheric composition at the same point\nin space during moderate geomagnetic activity. We have\nanalysed data from 22 January 2001 and 14 February 2001\non an L = 2.5 magnetic field line at the longitude of the\nAntarctic Peninsula. Mass density was determined from an\narray of magnetometers, while the electron number density\nwas determined from analysis of the group delay of man-\nmade VLF transmissions from north east America. The\nIMAGE satellite RPI experiment provided in-situ plasma\nwave measurments of the electron number density in the\nequatorial region of the L = 2.5 field line, while a few hours\nlater the IMAGE EUV Imager experiment was able to\nresolve the He+ abundance by looking back toward the\nsame spot.\n[42] On 22 January 2001 the mass density and electron\nnumber density were very similar. The levels were consis-\ntent with a moderately disturbed plasmasphere. The electron\nnumber density from IMAGE RPI was also in good\nagreement with the ground-based measurements at the times\nwhen it was close to the equatorial region of the L = 2.5\nfield line. The IMAGE EUV Imager measurements of He+\nwere relatively uniform throughout the plasmasphere, again\nindicative of moderately disturbed conditions, and the\ncolumn abundance value of 5.8 \u0001 1010 cm\u00022 is taken to\nrepresent those conditions. There was about 4% by number\nand 16% by mass of He+ relative to H+ at this time. On\n14 February 2001 there appeared to be significantly more\nresponse of the plasmasphere to the moderate (Kp = 5)\nactivity levels. The electron number density and the mass\ndensity showed a significant increase compared with\nJanuary 22 for most of the day. The IMAGE EUV Imager\nexperiment also indicated that a 20% increase in the\nabundance of He+ could be seen between these two days.\n[43] We find that for the longitudes of the Antarctic\nPeninsula and therefore the Americas, an EUV Imager\nHe+ column abundance value of 6 \u0001 1010 cm\u00022 is equiv-\nalent to plasmaspheric electron density levels of 3000 cm\u00023\nat L = 2.5. We also find that for these conditions the He+\nmass abundance is about 12\u201316% compared with H+. Both\ndecreases and increases in the He+ column abundance are\nappear to be linearly correlated to changes in the percentage\noccurrence of He+ as determined from a combination of\nground-based VLF and ULF observations, as well as in situ\nmeasurements from the RPI experiment.\n[44] Acknowledgments.
