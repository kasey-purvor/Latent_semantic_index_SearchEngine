As the \ninterface between a solid and liquid can be very complex it is necessary to account for the wetting regime \nthat takes place. Two of the most common wetting regimes is that of Wenzel and Cassie-Baxter. In most \ninstances it is seen that for hydrophilic surfaces (surfaces which provide contact angles of less than 90\u00b0) \nthe Wenzel wetting regime dominates in which the whole of the liquid wets the surface. For hydrophobic \nsurfaces (contact angles greater than 90\u00b0) the wetting regime tends to be that of Cassie-Baxter in which \nair-gaps are formed between the liquid-solid interface. However, in some cases it has been seen that it \nmay be possible for a hydrophilic surface to give rise to some form of Cassie-Baxter wetting or Cassie-\nBaxter\/Wenzel mixed intermediate wetting regime owed to the roughness and topographical pattern on \nthe surface [10,11]. In this instance it is seen in some cases that increasing the surface roughness, through \nthe patterning of a surface, can give rise to an increase in contact angle for hydrophilic materials. On the \nother hand, it has also been observed that in general, when the surface energy and its components are a \ndominant factor, the contact angle is a decreasing function of the polar component of the surface [12].  \nLeading on from this it can be seen that it is advantageous for these various applications to devise a \nrepeatable technique which would allow material surfaces to be modified in order to optimize that surface \nfor the required application. Numerous methods have been developed to produce these modified surfaces. \nSome of these methods are radiation grafting [13], plasma surface modification [14,15] and using various \ncoatings [6]. Laser surface modification [16,17] is another process which has the ability to modify both \nthe topography and surface chemistry of a material with negligible affect to the bulk properties. In \ncomparison to other competing techniques lasers offer a number of benefits such as relative cleanliness, \naccurate processing, non-contact and flexible processing.  \nIn terms of laser beam interactions with materials, the way a material responds to the incident laser is \nhighly dependant upon a number of parameters. Specific to polymers, IR lasers give rise to resonant \ncoupling in the form of bond and lattice vibrations allowing for the processing to be thermolytical. This is \ndue to the fact that the photon is only weakly absorbed by the polymer, with the energy that has been \nabsorbed being distributed to vibrational modes [18]. Whereas, UV lasers tend to give rise to the \nabsorption of the light through electronic excitation which is often within delocalized electron \nconfigurations. In consequence polymers can have broad absorption features and directly break the \npolymer bonds as a result of the high photon energy [19]. With most lasers it is seen that the smallest \npossible features that can be achieved are on the micron scale; however, nano-structures have been \nachieved using a laser emitting at a wavelength of 157nm [20]. These variations in micro and nano-\nstructured topographies have been seen to have a major influence on the characteristic contact angle that \narises from the processing [21,22]. In addition, it has also been observed that in some instances the \nsurface chemistry dominates the wettability characteristics of a material, such as through the work of \nKietzig et al. [23] which observed that for metallic surfaces the carbon content appears to have a \nconsiderable influence on the wettability characteristics.   \nLasers can be employed to produce variations in surface characteristics which can induce a change in \ncontact angle, surface energy and surface chemistry. In fact for some applications such as those within the \nbiomedical field it has been stated that the characteristic wettability properties may be the driving force in \ndetermining how certain cells will react to a material [12]. The role of wettability in biomaterials science \nhas been one of the most interesting subject areas in biomaterials surface science for a number of years \nand has allowed many to endeavor to determine the complex links between surface wetting and \nbioactivity [24]. This is owed to the fact that the common theme emanating from past work is that in \nmany applications it is seen that the bulk properties of a biomaterial are decided upon such that the \nsurface properties are compromised [12,25]. Through the available literature it can be seen that extensive \nresearch is now being carried out regarding this in the attempt to link wettability and bioactivity of \nmaterials [3,4]. \nThroughout the literature it is seen that a correlation between the laser wavelengths and wettability has \nnot been fully established. As such, this paper is the beginning of a long-term study into the variation of \nwettability and the parameters which affect it by using lasers with differing wavelengths. For this research \nCO2 and excimer lasers have been employed and compared to produce surface variations in nylon 6,6 \nalong with the wettability characteristics being quantified in terms of advancing contact angle, apparent \nsurface energies and surface O2 content. \n3 \u2013 Experimental Procedures \n3.1 \u2013 CO2 Laser System \nIn order to generate the required marking pattern, specific software (Winmark software 2.1.0.3468; \nSynrad Inc., USA) to the laser was used. In addition, the software was capable of using images saved as \n.dxf files which can be produced by using CAD programs such as, in this case, Licom AutoCaM. The \nsample material was held in the system with a bracket on a variable z-axis stage and was positioned at the \nfocal length, which was 250 mm from the laser aperture to the sample surface. The 10.6 \u03bcm wavelength \ncw 10 W CO2 laser system (Synrad Inc., USA), with a spot size of 100 \u03bcm, used a galvanometer scanner \nto scan the beam directly across the target material in conjunction with the pattern produced on the \nSynrad software. It should also be noted here that the target material and laser system was held in a laser \nsafety cabinet in which the ambient gas was air. Additionally, an extraction system was used to remove \nany fumes produced during laser processing.  \n3.2 \u2013 F2 Excimer Laser System \nThe F2 excimer laser system (LPF 202; Lambda Physik Inc., USA) operated at a wavelength of 157 nm. \nThe max pulse energy was 35 mJ and a pulse duration ~ 11 ns (FWHM) at 26 kV charging voltage. \nSamples were irradiated using a projection etching system, see Figure 1, and the lateral position of the \nsamples were controlled using computerized stages with typically one micron resolution. The beam \ndelivery system consisted of a ~ 2 meter long stainless steel beam tube between the laser and sample \nchamber which was evacuated to expel absorbing oxygen species. Experiments were carried out at \npressure of around 2\u00d710\n-3\n mbar. \nIn order to achieve the required trench dimensions an aperture projection mask was produced using \nSS316 foil (Laser Micromachining Ltd., UK). The mask was 30 \u00d7 30 mm\n2\n and consisted of an array of \nfive apertures with a diameter of 0.5 mm in a straight line spaced by 1mm centre to centre. This allowed \n50 \u03bcm wide trenches to be etched, spaced by 50 \u03bcm upon using a demagnification of 10. \n3.3 \u2013 Laser Irradiation Procedures \nThe nylon 6,6 was sourced in 100 \u00d7 100 mm\n2\n sheets with a thickness of 5 mm (Goodfellow Cambridge \nLtd., UK). To obtain a conveniently sized sample for experimentation, the as-received nylon sheet was \ncut into 30 mm diameter discs using a 1 kW cw CO2 laser (Everlase S48; Coherent Ltd, UK). No \ndiscernible heat affected zone (HAZ) was observed under optical microscopic examination.  \nFor the Synrad CO2 laser system, trenches were produced with a spacing of 50 \u03bcm between each trench \nby scanning the beam across the target material. To produce these spaces, each experiment was carried \nout twice: firstly using a power of 50% (5 W) with a velocity of 1000 mms\n-1\n and secondly using a power \nof 80% (8 W) with the same velocity (sample C10 and C9, respectively). With powers of 5 and 8 W used \nand a spot size of 100 \u03bcm the corresponding irradiances used for these experiments were 6.4 and 10.2 \nkWcm\n-2\n respectively.   \nThe F2 excimer laser system was used to produce two areas of etched trenches by traversing the stage and \nkeeping the beam stationary. The first of these being to achieve an etch depth of approximately 1 \u03bcm \n(sample F3) and the second giving a depth of  approximately 10 \u03bcm (sample F4). In order to achieve these \ndepths each site required 1,000 and 10,000 pulses, respectively, as the etch depth per pulse was \ndetermined to be approximately 1 nm per pulse. With this in mind it was possible to determine the \ntraverse velocities, vt, by using Equation (1). \nN\nDR\nvt \uf03d  (1) \nWhere D is the diameter of one of the apertures in the mask, R is the repetition rate (which was 20 Hz) \nand N is the number of pulses. Upon using this equation it was determined that for 1 and 10 \u03bcm deep \ntrenches velocities of 0.01\n \nand 0.001 mms\n-1\n were to be used, respectively. It should be noted that the when \ncarrying out the experiments using the F2 laser a constant fluence of 40 mJcm\n-2\n was used.  \nFor comparison between the laser irradiated samples an as-received reference sample (N6) was also \nstudied. This allowed any deviations from the original as-received characteristics to be identified after the \nlaser processing had taken place. \n3.4 \u2013 Mechanical Roughening Procedure \nFor further verification of laser induced contact angle modification two samples were roughened \nmanually using DA-F P220 emery paper. One sample was roughened using a zig-zag motion traversing \nfrom the top to the bottom of the sample (sample R1). The second sample (sample R2) was roughened by \ncarrying out the same technique as the first sample, with the addition of rotating the sample through 90\u00b0 \nand repeating the roughening method with the emery paper. \n3.5 \u2013 Topography, Wettability Characteristics and Surface Chemistry Analysis \nAfter the laser irradiation of the nylon 6,6 samples they were analysed using a number of techniques. An \noptical microscope (Flash 200 Smartscope; OGP Ltd, UK) was used to obtain optical micrographs of the \nsamples. The surface profiles were determined using a white light interferometer (WLI) (NewView 500; \nZygo Ltd, USA) with MetroPro and TalyMap Gold Software. The Zygo WLI was setup using a \u00d710 \nMirau lens with a zoom of \u00d70.5 and working distance of 7.6 mm. This system also allowed Sa and Ra \nroughness parameters to be determined for each sample. \nThe samples were ultrasonically cleaned in isoproponal (Fisher Scientific Ltd., UK) for 3 minutes at room \ntemperature before using a sessile drop device to determine various wettability characteristics, in \naccordance with the procedure detailed by Rance [26]. This was to allow for a relatively clean surface \nprior to any contact angle measurements being taken. A sessile drop device (OCA20; Dataphysics \nInstruments, GmbH) was used in conjunction with specific software (SCA20; Dataphysics Instruments, \nGmbH) so that the recent advancing and receding contact angles for triply distilled water and the recent \nadvancing angle for diodomethane could be determined for each sample. By achieving the advancing and \nreceding contact angles the hysteresis for the system was determined. This was done by using the \u2018needle \nin\u2019 method to accurately add or remove liquid to give the advancing and receding liquid-solid-vapour line, \nrespectively. In addition, by knowing the advancing contact angles for the two liquids it was possible to \nuse the software to draw a Owens, Wendt, Rabel and Kaeble (OWRK) plot to determine the surface \nenergy of the samples. For the two reference liquids the SCA20 software used the Str\u00f6m et al. technique \nto calculate the surface energy of the material. It should be noted here that 10 contact angles, using 2 \ndroplets, in each instance was recorded to achieve a mean contact angle for each liquid-surface interface.   \nSelected samples were analysed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), were also sputter coated \nwith Au to attain adequate conductance and analysed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and \nenergy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis. This allowed any surface modifications in terms of chemical \ncomposition due to the laser irradiation to be revealed.     \n4 \u2013 Results and Discussion \n4.1 \u2013 Optical Microscopy Analysis \nIn order to effectively and completely compare the laser irradiated samples an optical micrograph of the \nas-received reference sample material was obtained, as can be seen in Figure 2. \nThe optical micrograph of the as-received reference sample shown in Figure 2 appears to have a minimal \nsurface topography. The black dots on the image arise from the debris from the cutting of the samples and \nas such was removed during the ultrasonic cleaning process.  \nIt was seen that both laser systems gave the ability to produce relatively good quality \u03bcm features on the \nnylon 6,6 samples. With regards to the trenches produced by the CO2  laser, with a distance of 50 \u03bcm \nbetween each trench, it can be seen in Figure 3 that no distinct trench lines had been produced. \nEven so, from Figure 3 it is possible to visualize that the CO2 beam was scanned horizontally across the \nsample. However, as the spot size of the CO2 laser was 100 \u03bcm the scan overlapped itself so that no \ndistinct periodic grooves were left in the material. In addition to this, gas bubble rupture sites can be seen \non the surface which is considered to be as a result of the melting and re-solidification of the nylon 6,6 \nfollowing CO2 laser processing. Also, as a consequence of the melting the material does not ablate with \nthe CO2 laser and as the material re-solidifies it produces a protrusion away from the surface. In \ncomparison, the F2 excimer laser produces grooves that were considerably better defined, as can be seen \nin Figure 4. One other major difference that the F2 excimer laser offers is that the trenches were ablated \nand etched into the nylon 6,6 sample.  \n4.2 \u2013 White Light Inteferometry Analysis \nThe Zygo WLI and TalyMap Gold software were employed to elucidate the surface properties of the laser \nirradiated surfaces. Figure 5 shows the continuous axonometric and profile extraction of the as-received \nreference nylon 6,6 sample.  \nThe continuous axonometric and profile extraction (see Figure 5) shows qualitatively how smooth the \nsurface of the nylon 6,6 was prior to laser irradiation. In quantitive terms by utilizing the software the  \nroughness parameters for the as-received reference sample were determined to be 0.038 and 0.043 \u03bcm for \nSa and Ra, respectively. The profile extraction (see Figure 5) allowed one to see that maximum peak \nheights of the surface topography was up to 0.3 \u03bcm. In comparison, the CO2 laser irradiated samples were \nconsiderably rougher than the as-received reference sample indicating that considerable surface \ntopography changes of nylon 6,6 were possible by utilizing this specific type of laser. Figures 6 and 7 \nshow continuous axonometric and profile extractions (perpendicular to the grooves) for the CO2 laser \nirradiated samples. \nThe surface roughness parameters, Sa and Ra, were determined for each of the surfaces, all of which are \ngiven in Table 1. The Sa roughness values for the 5 W CO2 laser irradiated nylon surface was found to be \n0.262 \u03bcm, whereas the higher power of 8 W gave rise to a slightly rougher surface with an Sa value of \n0.358 \u03bcm. In addition, the effect the beam had on the surface topography can be seen more prominently in \nFigures 6 and 7. However, by taking a profile extraction (see Figures 6 and 7) of the surfaces \nperpendicular to the direction of the grooves, it can be seen that there was slight periodicity to the surface \npattern in comparison to the F2 excimer laser patterned samples (see Figures 8 and 9). This is due to the \nfact that the CO2 laser spot size was larger than the intended surface pattern and the scanned beam \noverlapped during processing inherently eradicating the natural periodicity of the induced pattern. In \naddition, Figures 6 and 7 show that the maximum peak height observed for C10 and C9 were 2 and 3 \u03bcm \nrespectively, which is considerably larger then that of the as-received reference sample (N6). Even though \nthere was little periodicity for the patterned samples shown in Figures 6 and 7, it can be seen that there \nwere distinct grooves produced in the nylon 6,6 as a result of the CO2 laser processing. This is more \ndiscernible when comparing the continuous axonometric images (see Figures 6 and 7) with that of the as-\nreceived reference sample shown in Figure 5, along with the relative profile extraction curves.  \nFigures 8 and 9 show the continuous axonometric images for the F2 excimer laser irradiated nylon \nsurfaces for different pulse numbers per site. The etched trenches using the F2 excimer laser shown in \nFigures 8 and 9 were considerably more defined than the CO2 laser irradiated samples (see Figures 6 and \n7). In comparison to the CO2 laser irradiated samples the pattern excimer etched into the sample had a \nmore distinct periodicity and can be easily identified with the profile extractions as shown in Figures 8 \nand 9. The roughness parameter, Sa, for the surface (F3) was found to be 0.248 \u03bcm, whereas the \nroughness for F4 was found to be 2.647 \u03bcm which was considerably greater than the other three samples \ndue to the depth of the trenches being approximately 10 \u03bcm. It should be noted that for the other three \nsamples the surface features were around 2 to 5 \u03bcm as can be seen in the other profile extractions (Figures \n6, 7, 8 and 9). In comparison with the as-received reference sample it can be seen that both lasers are \ncapable of increasing the roughness of the surface of nylon 6,6; however, as the F2 excimer laser offers \nbetter precision and accuracy due to the etch rate for this particular system being of the order of 1 nm per \npulse it can be seen that the laser-induced topographical pattern can be more accurately controlled with \nthe excimer laser. This is contrasted with the CO2 laser system as the surface pattern is dependant on the \nsurface melting and resolidifying to produce protrusions out of the surface which gives rise to a noticeable \nlevel of inaccuracy for the surface topographical pattern. \n4.3 \u2013 Effects of Laser Irradiation on the Wettability Characteristics \nAs it has already been discussed, it is believed by many that the wettability of a material is the potential \ndriving force in regards to the prediction of how a biomaterial will perform within a biological \nenvironment [3,12,17]. The dynamic advancing contact angles, hysteresis and surface energies for each of \nthe samples can be seen in Table 1, along with the roughness parameters Sa, Ra for each sample. \nFor all of the laser surface patterned samples it can be seen from Table 1 that the surface roughness has \nbeen increased considerably  in comparison to the as-received reference sample (N6). That is, the Ra and \nSa increased by up to 2.9 and 2.6 \u03bcm, respectively. The largest roughness values were produced using the \nF2 excimer laser (samples F3 and F4) which can be owed to the fact that deeper trenches were induced \ncompared with the features arising from using the CO2 laser marker (samples C10 and C9). It can also be \nseen from Table 1 that the contact angle for each laser patterned sample increased with the F2 excimer \nlaser patterned samples giving the largest change with a contact angle of 72.92\u00b0 for the roughest sample \n(sample F4). This does not concur with current theory as the contact angle should decrease with \nincreasing surface roughness for initially hydrophilic materials which have a contact angle less than 90\u00b0 \nprior to any modifications taking place [12,27]. After CO2 laser irradiation the apparent total surface \nenergy, \u03b3T, was slightly reduced due to a change in polar, \u03b3P, and dispersive, \u03b3D, components. It can be \nseen that the apparent \u03b3P increases by up to 4.12 mJm-2 for the rougher sample (sample C9), whereas the \n\u03b3D was reduced at most by 12.22 mJm-2. As it is \u03b3P of the surface energy that plays the major role in \ndetermining the contact angle it can be seen that these results also do not correspond with existing theory. \nFor instance, Lawrence and Li [25] stated that a laser-induced increase in the \u03b3P, along with an increase in \nO2 content, would give rise to a reduction in the contact angle. However, it has been seen that the \napparent \u03b3T reduces for the CO2 laser patterned nylon 6,6 surfaces and this could correspond with current \ntheory as it has previously been observed that the contact angle is inversely proportional to \u03b3T [28]. \nFollowing on, subsequent to F2 excimer laser patterning \u03b3\nT\n and \u03b3P was considerably reduce with \u03b3P \nreducing by up to 10 mJm\n-2\n (See Table 1). It is highly likely that this rise in contact angle can be \nattributed to the significant reduction of the apparent \u03b3T resulting from an intermediate mixed state \nwetting regime arising from the topographical pattern induced onto the nylon 6,6 samples. This mixed \nstate wetting regime was also hypothesized by Lee and Kwon who also observed an increase in contact \nangle for patterned topographies on a hydrophilic surface [10]. \nIn order to determine if these changes in surface energies were as a result of variations in surface \nchemistry the samples where analysed using XPS and EDX. Table 1 shows the surface O2 content for all \nof the samples. The as-received reference sample showed that the surface O2 content was initially 11.90% \nAt. (20.76% for EDX). In comparison, for the CO2 laser patterned samples the oxygen content had risen \nslightly by up to 1.5% At. (2.03% for EDX), whereas the F2 excimer laser patterned samples had less \nsurface oxygen content with a reduction of up to 1.6% At. (4.42% for EDX). The O2 in the ambient air of \nthe CO2 system would have allowed oxidation of the surface to occur as the molten nylon re-solidified. \nAdditionally, as the  F2 excimer laser system was under vacuum, there would have been a reduction in \nambient air and as a result the surface would not oxidize and could potentially lose O2 content during the \nlaser ablation process. From these results one can deduce that the effect of surface O2 content is not \nconclusive and as such it can be seen that it is more likely that the mixed state wetting regime owed to the \ninduced topographical patterns are the dominating factor in this instance. It should also be noted that the \nXPS data showed no other significant amounts of other elements present before or after the laser \nprocessing, other than carbon and oxygen which are the main constituents of nylon 6,6.    \nTo clarify how the laser induced patterns effected changes in the characteristic contact angle, two samples \nwere mechanically roughened using emery paper, of which the continuous axonometric images can be \nseen in Figure 10 and 11. As a result of the mechanical roughening of the samples it can be seen in Table \n1 that an increase in apparent polar component and roughness has given rise to a significant reduction in \ncontact angle, which agrees with Lawrence and Li [25]; that is, the apparent polar component increased \nby up to 4.53 mJm\n-2\n and a considerable increase in surface roughness of up to 100 times that of the as-\nreceived reference sample was observed for samples R1 and R2. Also, as given in Table 1 the surface O2 \ncontent for the manually roughened samples was somewhat unchanged in comparison to the as-received \nreference sample, highlighting that the surface roughness, surface energy and topographical pattern have \nmore of an impact on the wettability characteristics. This finding can be seen to be of significance as even \nthough there was a considerable increase in surface roughness the manually roughened samples (see \nFigures 10 and 11) gave an indication that no periodic pattern was induced on the surface of the nylon 6,6 \nsamples. In contrast, the laser patterned samples had more periodic patterns relative to the manually \nroughened surfaces and from this it can be seen that the periodic patterns had an extremely large affect on \nthe wettability of the samples. As discussed by Jung and Bhushan [29] there are two regimes in which a \nmaterial can wet: the Cassie-Baxter and Wenzel regimes. The Wenzel regime, shown in Figure 12, allows \nthe whole sample to be wetted such that the droplet is in complete contact with the surface. On the other \nhand, the Cassie-Baxter regime, shown in Figure 13, allows the droplet to rest upon the roughened surface \npeaks forming air gaps between the droplet and the surface.  \nIt is proposed here that a change from the Wenzel regime to a mixed state wetting regime was the likely \nreason for the observed increase in the contact angle for the CO2 laser and F2 excimer laser patterned \nnylon 6,6 in accordance with work carried out by others [10,30-32]. That is the liquid, when in contact \nwith the sample surface, gives rise to a mixture of Wenzel and Cassie-Baxter regimes. This can be an \nexplanation as to how an increase in contact angle was observed for the laser patterned samples and still \nbe hydrophilic. Therefore, it has been seen in this instance that the topographical surface pattern appears \nto be the main driver for the manipulation of the wettability characteristics.  \nDue to the ability of using these laser systems to manipulate the wettability characteristics further \nresearch can be carried out by undertaking biological testing of the laser patterned samples. This would \ndetermine if cell adhesion and proliferation can be optimized by using these lasers to produce surface \nmodification in terms of surface chemistry and surface topography. In addition, as nylon 6,6 has a high \nwater absorption rate it may be possible to identify, through extended research, whether surface \nmodifications using laser technology allows this parameter to be reduced. By experimenting with \ndifferent ambient gases it may also be possible to inflict greater chemical changes on the surface of the \nmaterial allowing for further studies of how the chemical nature of the surface gives rise to the variation \nin contact angle and surface energy. \n5 \u2013 Conclusions \nIt has been demonstrated that both the CO2 and F2 excimer laser systems that have been employed in this \nstudy have the ability to modify the surface of nylon 6,6. The CO2 laser couples into the material via \nresonant coupling which gives rise to bond vibrations allowing the temperature to rise and melt the \nmaterial. Upon cooling the molten material re-solidifies and a protrusion away from the surface becomes \nevident on the surface. This is contrasted with the F2 excimer laser as it ablates the nylon 6,6 allowing the \nrequired pattern to be etched into the material. As a result the F2 excimer laser system offers a major \nadvantage over the CO2 in the fact that it ablates approximately 1nm per pulse, with the fluence used in \nthis instance, allowing the user to be more precise and accurate with the surface topography they require. \nHowever, the amount of time it takes to pump the F2 vacuum system to operating pressure and the amount \nof time it takes to produce a number of few \u03bcm deep trenches is considerably greater than the CO2 laser \nsystem employed in this study.  \nBoth of the laser systems affect differently the nylon 6,6 samples with regards to wettability and surface \nenergy parameters \u2013 two major factors which are believed to manipulate the bioactivity of a material in \nregards to cell adhesion and proliferation. The CO2 laser has been seen to be capable of producing contact \nangles slightly larger in comparison to the as-received reference sample In this instance, as a result of the \nCO2 laser patterning the surface O2 content increased by up to 1.5% At. and the apparent polar component \nalso increased by up to 4.12 mJm\n-2\n. This does not agree with current theory as an increase in apparent \npolar component and surface O2 content should give rise to a reduction in contact angle. In contrast, for \nthe F2 excimer laser patterned samples the apparent polar component and surface O2 content decreased by \nup to 11.69 mJm\n-2\n and 1.6% At., respectively. It has been proposed here that the increase in contact angle \nresulting from the laser modifications is due to the patterned topographies, such that they give rise to a \nintermediate mixed state wetting regime in which both Wenzel and Cassie-Baxter regimes arise. This \nallows one to see how the CO2 laser irradiated samples would give a larger contact angle in comparison to \nthe as-received reference sample. To aid in clarification, manually roughened samples were analysed \nwhich showed that for a non-periodic rough surface the apparent polar component increased and surface \nO2 content remained somewhat unchanged giving rise to a reduction in contact angle. Significantly, this \nshows that the surface pattern dominates the wettability characteristics for the laser induced patterned \nnylon 6,6 samples.  \n6 \u2013 Acknowledgements \nWe would like to thank Directed Light Inc., East Midlands NHS Innovation Hub, Nobel Biocare and \nPhotomachining Inc. for all of their much appreciated support.
