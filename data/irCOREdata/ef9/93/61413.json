Much of the momentum flux in the mesopause region comes5\nfrom gravity waves with periods less than 30 minutes (Fritts & Vincent, 1987).6\nThe gravity wave field is not well known in this region and thus the gravity7\nwave parameterisations input into global circulation models (GCMs) will not8\nproduce accurate results when compared to real data. The importance of in-9\ncluding an accurate representation of the gravity wave field in GCMs is out-10\nlined in Fritts et al. (2006). One of the main ways of observing gravity wave11\nactivity in the mesopause region is using an airglow imager to infer the ampli-12\ntude and direction of the short period waves (e.g. Taylor et al. 1995) seen as13\ntracers in the airglow layer at around 87km altitude; wintertime climatologies14\nof gravity wave momentum flux over Halley (76\u25e6S, 27\u25e6W) and Rothera (68\u25e6S,15\n68\u25e6W) have been generated using airglow imager data (Espy et al., 2004, 2006).16\nHowever, as the technique requires dark and cloud-free conditions, such im-17\nagers are unable to observe during the Antarctic summer. Imaging riometers,18\non the other hand, are able to observe regardless of these sky conditions and19\n\u2217 Corresponding author.\nEmail address: tmof@bas.ac.uk (T. Moffat-Griffin).\n2\ncan provide a way to measure year round gravity wave fluxes.20\nThis paper describes a technique that is applied for the first time to imaging21\nriometer absorption data to extract gravity wave parameters accurately. The22\nlimitations of this technique are tested using synthetic imaging riometer data.23\nThe technique is also applied to several real gravity wave events, seen in a24\nco-located airglow imager, to compare derived wavelength, phase speed and25\nwave direction.26\n2 The Imaging Riometer27\nA riometer measures the intensity of cosmic radio noise received at the surface28\nof the Earth. If no absorption occurs then the intensity of the cosmic radio29\nnoise signal received is cyclic, with the period of a sidereal day, this signal is30\nknown as a quiet day curve. If absorption occurs, the intensity of the cosmic31\nradio noise received decreases and hence the absorption in the atmosphere32\ncan be determined. Riometer frequencies, usually between 28 and 40 MHz,33\nresult in a maximum peak in absorption around 90km altitude (Friedrich &34\nTorkar, 1983) in the D-region of the ionosphere. At Halley, most absorption35\nevents are due to auroral sources (Hargreaves & Jarvis, 1986), although for this36\nstudy it is required that it is geomagnetically quiet. As the imaging riometer37\nis not being used for usual precipitation studies the peak absorption altitude38\nis likely to differ from 90km. Work on riometer absorption profiles, (Friedrich39\n& Torkar, 1983), has shown that as the absorption decreases from 0.5dB to40\n0dB the altitude of the peak absorption rises from around 86km to around41\n100km. The thickness layer of the absorption region has also been shown to42\nvary from 12km to 20km, (Hargreaves, 1980).43\n3\nThe imaging riometer (Detrick & Rosenberg, 1990) is an advance on the basic44\nriometer as it uses a narrow beam antenna array to spatially sample the region45\nof interest in contrast to a spatially isolated measurement from a single wide46\nbeam. The imaging riometer for ionospheric studies (IRIS) at Halley has a47\n64-element crossed dipole array, phased to produce 49 separate beams, each48\n13\u25e6 wide at the 3dB power level. A region of over 200km by 200km at 90km49\naltitude is sampled (Rosenberg & Detrick, 1991). The Halley IRIS operates50\nat 38.2MHz (a protected band for radio astronomy - so minimising man-made51\ninterference). It records data at high (1s) time resolution (all the beams are52\ntemporally coincident) but coarse (minimum 22km) spatial resolution (Rose53\net al., 2000). Figure 1 shows the projection of the riometer beams at 90km54\naltitude as defined by the 3dB beam projections. The separation between55\nthe circular beam projections near the centre is about 22km; the separation56\nbetween the non-central elliptical beam projections is significantly larger.57\nThe multi-beam configuration of the Halley IRIS and its field of view make it58\ncapable of detecting gravity waves passing horizontally overhead.59\n3 Gravity Wave Detection60\nShort period gravity waves have been detected in imaging riometer data, from61\nHalley, in a previous study by Jarvis et al. (2003) who demonstrated that a62\nsingle wave observed in a co-located airglow imager was also present in the63\ncentral beams of the Halley IRIS. The wave was first seen in the airglow imager64\nat 07:25UT on 7th June 2000 yet did not become apparent in the IRIS data65\nuntil 08:00UT. Spectral analysis identified 3 wave periods, of which one agreed66\nwith the parameters given by the airglow imager.67\n4\nHere we explore the possibility of using a more rigorous analysis method that68\nhas the potential to be applied semi-automatically to the complete archive69\n(1997 to present day) of imaging riometer data. This provides the potential70\nto build up a year-round climatology of gravity fluxes at Halley, Antarctica.71\n3.1 Wavelet Analysis72\nWavelet analysis is a technique that is suited to analysing bursty, frequency73\nvarying events that have non-stationary phase throughout the dataset. Grav-74\nity waves are such events and thus wavelet analysis lends itself well to their75\nidentification.76\nThe Morlet wavelet is used and the transform method outlined in Torrence &77\nCompo (1998) is implemented in this analysis. The variance of the time series78\nat each wavelet scale (period) is given by the wavelet power spectrum, which79\nis defined as the absolute value of the square of the wavelet transform. The80\nwavelet squared coherency, effectively measuring the cross-correlation between81\ntwo wavelet power spectra, is used to identify potential wave features that oc-82\ncur at the same period and time range in the two time series. The wavelet83\ncoherency phase difference between these coherent features is the key param-84\neter required for IRIS gravity wave parameter extraction and this is provided85\nby the method outlined in Torrence & Webster (1999).86\nWith knowledge of the distance between the imaging riometer beams projected87\nat a given altitude, the period of the wave feature and its phase difference,88\nthe horizontal phase velocity and the horizontal wavelength are calculated.89\nEquations for the horizontal phase velocity (Equation 1) and the horizontal90\n5\nwavelength (Equation 2) are given below:91\nVp =\n2pi\u2206x\n\u2206\u03c6T\n(1)92\n\u03bb =\n2pi\u2206x\n\u2206\u03c6\n(2)93\nwhere \u2206x is the distance between the beams, \u2206\u03c6 is the phase difference be-94\ntween the beams in radians and T is the wave period in seconds.95\nThe spatial resolution of IRIS puts a limitation on the resolvable horizontal96\nwavelengths of 2\u2206x. For the central beams, this results in a lowest resolvable97\nlimit of 45km for the horizontal wavelength. Any waves that pass through98\nthe field of view with horizontal wavelengths shorter than this limit would be99\ndifficult to accurately resolve and any parameters derived from them would100\ntherefore not be reliable. A method to eliminate this problem has been de-101\nveloped and requires a wave feature to be detected in three linearly adjacent102\nbeams over the same period and time range. Figure 2 illustrates the separa-103\ntion between three of the beams and using simple wave theory, Equation 3 is104\nderived.105\ndab\ndbb2\n=\n\u2206\u03c6ab\n\u2206\u03c6bb2\n(3)106\nThe beam separations dab and dbb2 are known, and the phase difference ratio,107\non the right-hand side of Equation 3, can be adjusted using \u00b12npi until the108\nbest match to the beam separation ratio is found, where n is any integer. The109\nadjusted phase difference values then represent the actual phase difference.110\nThis adjustment can then be applied to the phase differences in Equations 1111\nand 2 to calculate the true wavelength and phase velocity of the wave feature.112\nThe ability to calculate this necessary adjustment relies on the fact that the113\n6\nbeam separations at any fixed altitude are neither equal nor have an integer114\nratio.115\nFinally, the direction of the wave can be calculated by using a technique116\noutlined in Donelan et al. (1996) for application to ocean waves. Two phase117\ndifferences of a wave feature, measured in near orthogonal directions, are re-118\nquired. For the Halley case, the central beam phase differences between the119\nIRIS north-south and east-west beams are at exactly 90\u25e6 and the wave direc-120\ntion is given by Equation 4:121\n\u03b8 = atan(\n\u2206\u03c6ac\n\u2206\u03c6ab\n) (4)122\nWhere the subscripts ac refer to the north-south pair of beams and ab the123\neast-west pair of beams. For the case here 0\u25e6 and 360\u25e6 are pointing north, with124\nthe angles increasing in a clockwise direction.125\n4 Synthetic Data Results126\n4.1 Attenuation of the IRIS beams127\nThe beam profile of each of the central IRIS beams approximates a Gaussian,128\nwhere the beam width is taken to be the FWHM. This shape results in the129\nattenuation of the signal observed. The beam widths for beams a, b and b2 are,130\nat 90km altitude, 17.6km, 17.9km and 18.8km respectively. Figure 3 shows how131\nthe amplitude of different wavelength horizontal waves would be attenuated132\nby each beam. It shows that the three beams exhibit a similar attenuation133\npattern and that waves with a horizontal wavelength of 10km and less have134\n7\ntheir amplitudes reduced by a factor of 100,000, making them undetectable.135\nThere is no observed phase shift associated with this attenuation.136\nThe results in the next sections are for synthetic waves, already attenuated by137\nthe beams, and discuss the effect of signal noise on the detection capabilities.138\n4.2 Extracting wave parameters139\nTime series for the five beams in Figure 1 are produced for unit amplitude140\nwaves with various wavelengths, frequencies and directions. The waves are of141\nthe form of Equation 5.142\nA(x, y, t) = sin(kxx + kyy \u2212 \u03c9t) (5)143\nwhere A is the wave amplitude, kx and ky are the x and y components of the144\nwavenumber, \u03c9 = 2pi\nT\nand t is the time in seconds. Figure 4 shows a typical145\nexample of the different beam signatures of a synthetic wave. In this instance146\nthe wave has horizontal wavelength of 20km, a speed of 19ms\u22121 and a direction147\nof 70\u25e6.148\nThe wavelet coherency spectrum of each of the five pairs of beams was gen-149\nerated and the phase differences from the regions of highest coherency were150\ndetermined. These were then adjusted, as shown in Section 3.1, and the hor-151\nizontal wavelength, horizontal phase velocity and wave direction were calcu-152\nlated. Table 1 shows the success of the technique with various wavelengths153\nand directions keeping the period constant at 1057s. This illustrates that it154\nis possible to detect short horizontal wavelengths down to 15km wavelength155\nreliably within the geometry of the 5 central beams.156\n8\nThis illustrates that the technique works for situations where the signal (wave)157\namplitude is large compared to the noise amplitude (a signal to noise ampli-158\ntude ratio of around 10) and the wavelength is 15km or longer. As real IRIS159\ndata is noisy, compared to the amplitude of the gravity wave signal, (Jarvis160\net al., 2003), the next section tests the limits of the technique by increasing161\nthe noise level (decreasing the signal to noise ratio).162\n4.3 Noisy data163\nThe same time series as above were reproduced but with different signal to164\nnoise ratios. The effect of increasing the noise in the time series is shown165\nby taking the standard deviation of the difference between the predicted and166\nactual wave parameter and comparing it to the log of the signal to noise ratio.167\nFigure 5 shows this type of plot for the standard deviations of the horizontal168\nphase velocity and direction differences.169\nAs the noise amplitude increases, the standard deviation of the parameter170\ndifference increases. The error of the predicted results increases. In both plots171\nin Figure 5 a sharp increase in standard deviation can be seen when the signal172\nto noise ratio is around 0.3. Beyond this point, the parameter predicted will173\nbecome more unreliable.174\nTo determine the extent to which the real IRIS data can be analysed in this175\nmanner a test is currently being developed that allows an estimate of the176\nsignal to noise amplitude ratio to be obtained. However, in the meantime, a177\nsimple estimation of the noise amplitude in real IRIS data can be performed178\nby filtering out any period longer than 3 minutes and taking the standard179\n9\ndeviation of the resulting time series.180\n5 Real IRIS Data181\nA test of the technique has been performed by comparing IRIS data to seven182\ngravity wave events observed in the OH airglow imager. These events have been183\nchosen from a climatological study that was done using the airglow imager,184\n(Nielsen , 2007). This study revealed a large number of extensive gravity waves185\nmeasured in the OH emission over Halley. The wave parameters spanned from186\n10-60km in horizontal wavelength, 5-100\u22121 in observed phase speed, and 5-30187\nminutes in observed period, with typical values of 26 km, 48 ms\u22121, and 10188\nminutes, respectively. For this test seven waves exhibiting wavelengths larger189\nthan 15km and periods greater than 10 minutes were selected for comparison.190\nThese criteria are based on the observing capabilities of the IRIS. Table 2191\nshows the dates and times of the events used in this study, plus the Kp index.192\nThe wavelet analysis technique outlined above is applied to each IRIS dataset193\nfor the relevant date and time.194\nThe events were analysed and strong wave features, coincident in period and195\ntime, were observed in their wavelet coherency spectra. The wavelet coherency196\nspectra for the East-West beam pairs of event E are shown in Figures 6 and197\n7 with the wave features highlighted. Figure 8 shows the regions where all198\nfour beam pairs have a wavelet coherency greater than 0.5 for event E and199\nthe horizontal solid line marks the observed period seen in the airglow imager.200\nThis enables a clearer identification of the wave event than Figures 6 and201\n7. Figure 9 is the same plot type as Figure 8 but for all the other events202\nstudied in this paper. It shows that the wave events consistently seen in all203\n10\n5 central beams of the IRIS data have similar periods to those observed in204\nthe airglow imager data. From the coherency spectra, the phase differences205\nbetween the features in different beams were estimated, and their horizontal206\nwavelengths, phase velocities and directions were calculated. Figures 10, 11, 12207\nand 13 compare the horizontal phase velocity, period, horizontal wavelength208\nand direction determined by the OH airglow imager and IRIS for each gravity209\nwave event. Figures 10, 11 and 12 show that there is agreement, including210\nerrors, between the velocities, period and wavelengths of waves observed by211\nboth instruments. Event D is the exception to this, where the predicted wave212\nvelocity by IRIS is about 60% of the value derived from the airglow imager213\ndata. Table 2 shows that for this event the Kp is 3, the highest of any event214\nstudied. This level of geomagnetic activity could be sufficient to increase the215\nvariability in the absorption level, obscuring the gravity wave signal more216\nthan a Kp level of 2 or less would. The small differences in values could in217\npart be because the instruments are looking at slightly different altitudes. For218\nthe direction comparisons shown in Figure 13 it is evident that the IRIS and219\nairglow imager direction results do not agree for all the events. There have220\nnot been any signal to noise estimates made for the IRIS data used in this221\npaper but some of the results imply that the noise levels may be high enough222\nto cause reliability issues with the direction measurements. A technique to223\nestimate the signal to noise level in the IRIS data is under development.224\n6 Summary225\nStudies with synthetic gravity wave IRIS data and real IRIS data have shown226\nthat the wavelet analysis technique outlined in this paper is successful, within227\n11\nits limits, in extracting gravity wave parameter information. The use of syn-228\nthetic data have provided a set of limits on the spectrum of gravity waves that229\ncan be detected, and the accuracy of these predictions due to noise. Waves230\nwith a horizontal wavelength less than 15km are difficult to obtain parameters231\nfor and parameters derived from a time series where the signal to noise ratio232\nis less than 0.25 have a much larger uncertainty associated with them than233\nthose with a higher signal to noise ratio.234\nThe results in Section 5 are encouraging. Comparisons between the airglow235\nimager results and the IRIS results demonstrate that the IRIS is capable of236\ndetecting gravity waves and that the wave period, wavelength, velocity and237\ndirection can be successfully extracted using a wavelet analysis technique. The238\nnoise levels in the IRIS data affect the reliability of the direction results; so239\nbeing able to determine accurately the signal to noise level of the IRIS data240\nwould increase the confidence in any future studies where the IRIS is used in241\na stand-alone situation to detect gravity waves in daylight.242\nWith a co-located airglow imager it is easy to verify that the waves observed in243\nIRIS are in the D\/E-region not the F-region; however in the summertime this244\ncomparison technique cannot be used. Kressman (1976) shows that when foF2245\nis below 5MHz, the absorption due to the F-region is less than 0.1dB. Thus, a246\nF-region gravity wave perturbation could cause a variation in the absorption247\nof around 0.01dB, which would be detectable. The use of an ionosonde, co-248\nlocated with the IRIS, is a possible method of identifying F-region gravity249\nwaves, (Kressman , 1976). Ionosonde data could be used in conjunction with250\nthe stand-alone IRIS data to determine whether waves seen in the IRIS are251\noccuring in the F-region - if a wave of a certain period is seen in the IRIS data252\nbut not the ionosonde then it is likely to be a wave in the mesosphere.253\n12\nThe analysis technique outlined in this paper will be applied to the entire254\nHalley IRIS dataset to build up a climatology of mesospheric gravity wave255\ncharacteristics over this region. However the technique can be applied to any256\n49 or more beam imaging riometer. There are many imaging riometers situated257\nacross the polar regions. The potential to exploit these additional datasets258\nand generate many polar climatologies is huge and would contribute to our259\nunderstanding of the mesospheric gravity wave field over the polar regions260\ngreatly.261\n7 Acknowledgements262\nThe Imaging Riometer for Ionospheric Studies (IRIS) is jointly supported by263\nthe Natural Environment Research Council and by the U.S. office of polar264\nprogrammes grant OPP-0003881.

The Kp index is included to show the level of319\ngeomagnetic activity. Those times with an asterisk are where the entire wave320\nevent duration could not be determined due to auroral events obscuring part321\nof the field of view.322\nFigure 1: Projection of the imaging riometer beams onto a horizontal plane323\nat 90km altitude, as defined by their 3dB contour.
