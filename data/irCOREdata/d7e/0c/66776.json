It is assumed that the values of continuity and community, \nthat tradition and the transmission of the same, are the values to be extolled \nand defended.  It is these values that confirm us in our authenticity.  \u2026 But \nis this not a conservative and reactionary myth that we who are of \nEuropean descent tell ourselves in order to cling to our centrality in the \nunderstanding of home?  While the rest of the world is forced to \naccommodate change and interruption, the continuity of tradition is \nconserved as a universal value by those who yield the power to define the \n\u2018universal\u2019.    \n    Iain Chambers (2001: 195) \n \n \nIntroduction \n \nThe landmark new Constitution for Europe seeks to define not only the Union\u2019s \ncompetences but also the very nature of European belonging.  Like similar landmark \nstatements and treaties over the last fifty years, the Constitution is clear that the \nproject of European integration \u2013 gathered around various economic and political \nreforms - will falter in the absence of a shared and mobilising cultural commons.  And \nlike its predecessors, it ends up defining the commons through heritage and tradition, \naround a perennial idea of European belonging based around four myths of origin: \nfirst, the rule of Roman law; second, solidarity based on Christian charity and \nmutuality; third, liberal democracy rooted in the rights and freedoms of the individual, \nand fourth, commonality based on reason and other Enlightenment universal \nprinciples. \n \nIt is worth asking, however, if this model of belonging is appropriate in an \nincreasingly multicultural and multiethnic Europe.  This is not to question the intrinsic \nmerits of the core values, but to cast doubt over their power to fire the imagination \nand loyalty of a very large section of European society drawing on very different \nsources of identity and affiliation.   Europe is now home to millions of people from \nnon-European backgrounds, many religious and cultural dispositions, and many \nnetworks of attachment based on diaspora connections and cultural influences from \naround the world.  Europe is as much a site of longings rooted in tradition \u2013 regional, \nnational and European - as it is a site of trans-national and trans-European \nattachments.  The latter attachments are not just held by so-called third county \n 2\ncommunities and cosmopolitans living in the fast lane of global travel and hybrid \nidentities, but also by native Europeans, now increasingly enmeshed in plural and \nglobal consumption norms and patterns.  Slowly, Europe is becoming Chinese, \nIndian, Romany, Albanian, French and Italian, Christian, Islamic, Buddhist or New \nAge, American, Disneyfied, one-earth conscious, ascetic, and locally communitarian.  \nIt is becoming a place of plural and strange belongings, drawing on varied \ngeographies of cultural formation.  And, for this, it is constantly on the move in \ncultural terms. \n \nWhat is it to be European in this context?  Around what can such diversity be woven \ntogether in the name of a shared or common identity, one that does not work with a \nhierarchy of worth based on ethnic or racial markers?  The prevailing Idea of Europe \nbased on the above myths of origin has been seen as the defining cultural trait of the \nold continent, pitched against, at different times, to tribal \u2018barbarism\u2019, religious \nsociety, communist or communalist organisation, and individualism.  After September \n11 and all that it has led to in terms of the many rushed and thoughtless associations \nforged between Islam, rogue sates and terrorism, many Western liberals have \nconsciously returned to these core values to propose them with urgency as a new \nworld standard of cohesion and civilisation, against the excesses of Americanism and, \nabove all, the \u2018terrors\u2019 of religious fundamentalism (Dahrendorf,   ).    \n \nThis new appeal to an old Idea of Europe is dangerous on two counts in the context of \nthe rise of a social world of increasing multicultural and multiethnic belongings.  \nFirst, the murmur of a war of crusade between Islam and the secular West arising out \nof the debris of Bosnia, September 11, Palestine, Afghanistan and Iraq, is forging a \nEuro-centric imaginary of a world split in two camps: a \u2018West\u2019 seen to be peace-\nloving and civilised because of its Enlightenment and Christian humanist values and \nan \u2018East\u2019 seen to be bellicose and infantile or irresponsible because of its religious \nzealotry and tribal behaviour.  The old Idea of Europe - despite its claim to universals \nstripped of ethnic and national moorings - is once again lending its name to demarcate \na space of progress and superiority against other worlds defined in ethno-religious \nterms.  Wittingly or not, it is personified in the cultural practices of White, Christian, \nreasoning Europeans, and perceived as such, it is vulnerable to the anger of the world \nmajority that is judged to be infantile, emotive and unreasonable.  Western liberal \n 3\nintellectuals are arrogant to believe in the superiority or universalism of the kind of \nthinking that underlies the Idea of Europe (Latour, 2002). \n \nSecond, as its universalistic moral pretensions come to be challenged by other world \nviews - from Islam to post-colonial ideologies and a variety of new global lifestyle \nand consumption norms - the old Idea of Europe will prove to be increasingly \nvulnerable as a motif for unity in Europe.  Who will it appeal to and who will care \nenough to be carried by it?  What will it mean to cosmopolitans and everyday \nconsumers riding the swell of global, made-up-as-you go, global affiliations?  How \nwill it fire the imagination and loyalty of minority ethnic groups with loyalties split \nbetween host nation and imagined communities dispersed around the world and in \nnon-European histories?  Indeed, will it mean much to the growing number of \neveryday folk in majority communities, who, destabilised by the presence of strangers \nin their midst as well as the complexities of multiple assaults on their identities, yearn \nfor the simplicity and security of local community and ethno-national belonging?  \nThese yearnings for cultural difference and distinction within Europe itself, as the first \npart of the paper argues, make the old Idea of Europe a blunt instrument for unity in a \nEurope that paradoxically is both too big and too small for far too many people as a \ncommons.   \n \nA new imaginary of European belonging is needed, it is argued in the second part of \nthe paper; one that acknowledges cultural difference without assuming any order of \nworth based on ethnicity or religion, and one that is also able to forge a new commons \nbased on values and principles that resonate across Europe\u2019s diverse communities.  \nFor this reason, it is claimed that the starting point cannot be the Europeanness of \nEurope, for example, long standing universals such as universal reason, Catholic \npiety, or the Protestant work ethic.  Instead, an alternative starting point is suggested \u2013 \none which happens to dig deep into a definition in Socratic Europe of freedom as the \nproduct of dialogue and engagement rather than the product of pre-given orders of \nworth.  Such a starting point suggests that empathy\/engagement with the stranger \ncould become the essence of what it is to be \u2018European\u2019.   \n \nThe paper suggests that two important principles for a new Idea of Europe, both of \nwhich have been actively discussed in this journal in a recent debate on \n 4\ncosmopolitanism (volume 19, 2002), spring out of this interpretation of what it is to \nbe free.  The first is the principle of hospitality, which Julia Kristeva has linked \netymologically to the original Greek definition of ethos as the habit of regular stay or \nshelter.  In a Europe in which we all will be strangers one day as we routinely move \u2013 \nwhether virtually or physically \u2013 from one cultural space to another, the principle of \nrefuge will become vital for many more than the minorities that currently need \nprotection from persecution and hardship.   \n \nThe second principle borne out of the Socratic reading of freedom is mutuality as the \nbasis of identification and belonging.  To be European, the paper argues, thus, is a \nmatter of how strangers engage with each other to construct a common public sphere \nand ethos of solidarity (Calhoun, 2002).  This process involves much more than the \n\u201creciprocal recognition of the Other in her\/his Otherness\u201d, as Jurgen Habermas and \nJacques Derrida (ref) have most recently argued in a call for Europe to be \u201cunited in \nits diversity\u201d.  Mutuality requires abandoning both nativist preconceptions of who has \nfirst call on the label \u2018European\u2019 as well as easy labelling of immigrants, travellers, \nethnic minorities, third-country settlers, Muslims, cosmopolitans, dissidents, as \u2018non-\nEuropean\u2019.  Mutuality implies that Europeanness is not about possessing a pre-defined \ncultural identity, but about becoming European through active engagement with, and \nnegotiation of, difference. \n \nWhy should it matter that Europe reflects on what it is to be European, on who can lay \nclaim being European, and on what Europe\u2019s common values should be?  One answer \nis that in a multiethnic and multicultural Europe, a failure to give open publicity to the \nprinciple of empathy with the stranger, all that it represents in shaping identities as \nwell as ensuring cultural change, will play into the hands of ethno-nationalists and \nxenophobes \u2013 abundant in number in both majority and minority communities \u2013 \ninterested in perpetuating the fiction of homeland cultural identities in Europe.  \nEurope has a clear choice to make.  It can deny the processes of cultural heterogeneity \nand hybridisation daily at work and allow ethnicity-based antagonisms to grow, aided \nby an overarching White Europeanist ideal of the good life.  Alternatively, it can \nrecognise the coming Europe of plural and hybrid cultures and affiliations and seek to \ndevelop an imaginary of becoming European through engagement with the stranger, \nand in ways that imply no threat to tradition and cultural autonomy.  \n 5\n The Idea of Europe \n \nThe Idea of Europe has a long and varied history, with much written on the topic (see, \nfor example, Delanty, 1995; Heffernan, 1998).  It builds on a long tradition stretching \nback to the late middle ages, proposing a common European identity based on reason, \nChristianity and democracy.  It has been invoked in the name of: Peace in an often \nviolent continent; Unity against a common enemy (Ottomans, Islam, Empire, \nCommunism, Americanism; and difference from the Other - societies with different \nmoral beliefs and cultural practices.  In the 1950s, the architects of European unity \nsaw integration, based on a common European ideal, as a way of decisively avoiding \na repeat of the horrors of the Holocaust.  In more recent decades, the Idea of Europe \nhas been mobilised to lubricate the case for further economic and political integration, \nbut also to  signal Europe\u2019s \u2018civilising\u2019 mission in the world, exemplified by Jacques \nDelors in a lecture to the College of Europe in Bruges:  \n \nI find myself dreaming of a Europe \u2026 which tends its immense cultural \nheritage so that it bears fruit, a Europe which imprints the mark of \nsolidarity on a world which is far too hard and too forgetful of its \nunderdeveloped regions \u2026 the perennial values of Europe (quoted in \nNielsen and Stubb, 1998: 68). \n \n \nThe Idea of Europe presupposes a commons based on four cardinal virtues with deep \nroots in an allegedly uniquely European contribution to world culture.  These are, as \nsummarised above, firstly the supremacy of a legal system based on Roman law; \nsecondly, an ethos of social solidarity and common understanding based on Christian \npiety and humanist recognition; thirdly, a democratic order rooted in recognition of \nthe rights and freedoms of the individual; and fourthly, a universalism based on \nReason and other Enlightenment principles of cosmopolitan belonging.  These four \nvirtues have been vigorously debated in discussions that have fed into the making of \nthe new European Constitution, and as ever, they feature large in its definition of \nEurope\u2019s defining ideal.  \n \n 6\n\u2026. in a multiethnic Europe \n \nAt face value, there seems nothing objectionable about these lofty principles.  Indeed, \nwho can object as they seem to be no more than a synthesis of what counts as being \nmodern, aligned to a global standard of freedom, equality and justice established by \nthe Old Continent and mobilised by both liberal and socialist orders around the world \nagainst tyrannies and inequalities based on prejudice, fear and gross violation of \nhuman rights and individual or collective freedom?  The answer is many, increasingly \ninformed by a global consciousness that to be modern is not necessarily to be \nEuropean (or American) and that the universals of Europe are just as constructed and \nethno-culturally circumscribed as any other faith system.  Such a consciousness of \nlegitimate alterity strikes at the heart of the European conceit of what defines the free \nperson, for as Bruno Latour (2002: 47) remarks in his recent diatribe against Western \nmoral superiority, \u2018most other parties do not recognize that there are humans, \nsubjects, individuals or rights-bearers; instead exploring the free-floating individual \nthey have multiplied the attachments \u2013 gods, fetishes, lineages, ancestors \u2013 that \nproduce possible subjectivities; for them the Western individual is a monster that \nshould be fiercely resisted\u2019.   \n \nThis \u2018war of the worlds\u2019 (ibid) that touches upon the fundaments of what it is to be \nhuman and what it is to be free should not be seen as a war between countries and \ncontinents, but is one that is brewing within Europe itself, and for this, demands an \ninquiry into the legitimacy of the Idea of Europe as a unifying ideal.  A sizeable \nproportion of the population in a number of member states consists of residents and \ncitizens from a non European background.  It is not easy to measure the size of this \npopulation, since the EU does not publish data on the ethnic composition or \ngeographical origins of member state citizens, but only on the origins of non-nationals \n(i.e. residents who are not citizens of the given member state).  This significantly \nunderestimates the size of the immigrant population by not counting \u2018non-natives\u2019 \nwho are citizens of that state (e.g. British Indians or Dutch Surinamese).  For \nexample, in Germany, non-nationals make up 8.5 per cent of the population, with 74 \nper cent of them originating from non-EU countries (CEC, 1997a).   \n \n 7\nA slightly better measure is the proportion of the foreign-born population, which \nincludes immigrants who have acquired the citizenship of the host state, but not their \noff-spring born in the host state.  In 1994 (CEC, 1998), the proportion of the foreign-\nborn population in a selection of member states was the following:  9.7 per cent in \nBelgium, 41 per cent of which originated from beyond another EU country; 5.3 per \ncent in Denmark (of which 74% non-EU); 11 per cent in France (of which 78% non-\nEU); 9 per cent in the Netherlands (of which 88% non-EU); 6.8 per cent in the UK (of \nwhich 71% non-EU); 4.6 per cent in Portugal (of which 77% non-EU); and 9.9 per \ncent in Sweden (of which 60% non-EU).  The inclusion of second and third \ngeneration citizens of immigrant parents would significantly inflate these figures (for \nexample, according to the 1991 Census, the non-white population alone in Great \nBritain was 5.5%).   \n \nThe member states have become multiethnic and multicultural societies.  This is no \nlonger a feature of only the ex-colonial nations such as Britain, France, Belgium and \nthe Netherlands, or countries such as Germany which imported cheap migrant labour \nto fuel economic expansion.  It marks also countries such as Sweden, Austria, Italy, \nGreece and Spain in which recent immigration is related to global poverty and flight \nfrom repressive regimes.  \n \nOne starting indicator of how far Europe is prepared for a \u2018war of the worlds\u2019 and the \nprospect of an \u2018assimilationist\u2019 consensus, gathered possibly around the core \nEuropean ideals, are public attitudes in the EU towards immigration from non-EU \ncountries.  The results are ambivalent.  In 1997, the European Year Against Racism, \nthe Commission\u2019s Eurobarometer survey (CEC, 1997b) showed that 21 per cent of \nEU citizens felt that people from the \u2018South of the Mediterranean\u2019 wishing to work in \nthe Union should not be accepted, 60 per cent felt that they should be accepted only \nwith restrictions, leaving only 13 per cent who were willing to accept them without \nrestrictions.  The Spanish, Finnish, Irish, Italians, and Portuguese were the most \naccepting, while more than a quarter of the citizens of Belgium (38%), Greece, France \n(both 29%), Austria (28%), Germany and Denmark (both 26%) felt that these workers \nshould be rejected.  The attitudes to foreigners are equally disturbing.  The same \nsurvey shows that on average 45 per cent of the EU population believes that there are \ntoo many foreigners in their country, 40 per cent believes that there are a lot (but not \n 8\ntoo many), with only 10 per cent believing that there are not a lot.  There are large \nvariations in attitudes between member states, similar to the pattern concerning work \nmigrants, with higher levels of tolerance shown in Finland, Ireland, Spain and \nPortugal, but with strong feelings against foreigners in Greece (71%), Belgium (60%), \nItaly (53%), and Germany (52%).   \n \nThe central question, however, is whether multiethnicity\/multinationality is seen to be \nthreatening, and here, the results are counter-intuitive.  The 1997 EU survey showed \nthat most Europeans find the presence of people of another nationality (83%) or \nanother race (81%) in their country not disturbing.  This seems to be the pattern across \nEurope, but Denmark, Belgium and Greece are exceptions, with more that 25 per cent \nfinding the presence of other nationalities or races disturbing.  This overall and \nnation-specific pattern of opinion was unchanged in Spring 2000 (Eurobarometer, \n53).  The general picture, thus, seems to be that while controls on immigration are \nseen to be desirable by Europeans, the majority, especially those least wedded to \nnational traditions alone, appear relatively sanguine \u2013 at least prior to September 11 - \nabout the presence of other nationalities and ethnic groups already settled in their \ncountry.  This is confirmed by table 1 which lists the fears of EU citizens associated \nwith European integration, based on a Eurobarometer survey of public opinion in \nAutumn 2000.  There are no directly xenophobic or racist fears, although anxieties \nover increased drug trafficking and organised crime as well as worries over loss of \nnational identity, could be linked with increased immigration in the minds of \nrespondents. \n \nTable 1.

One \ninterpretation is that the signs of tolerance towards others are indicative of an \nemerging postnationalism or \u2018banal cosmopolitanism\u2019 (Beck, 2002) based on \neveryday cultural mixture and hybridisation (e.g. through consumption), one that has \nno real need for a grand unifying project such as the traditional Idea of Europe.  This \nis a Europe \u2018travelling light\u2019 (Pieterse, 1999, 2001), carried forward upon the actuality \nof multiple identities and multiple senses of territorial identification: a plural Europe \nin continual cultural flux as a consequence of powerful forces of detraditionalisation \nyielding: \n \nIndividuals \u2026 enmeshed in multiple bonds of belonging created by the \nproliferation of social positions, associative networks and reference \ngroups.  We enter and leave this system much more than we used to in the \npast.  We are migrant animals. \u2026Thus we are subjected to mounting \npressure to change, to transfer, to translate what we were just a moment \nago into new codes and new forms of relation (Melucci, 1997: 61). \n \nZygmunt Bauman (1997) has claimed that the \u2018overwhelming feeling of uncertainty\u2019 \nand \u2018ambient fear\u2019 (p. 50) ensuing from detraditionalisation, deregulation, new world \ndisorder and indeterminacy, puts us in the midst of a new \u2018heterophilic age\u2019 in which \nthe \u2018question is no longer how to get rid of the strangers and the strange, but how to \nlive with them \u2013 daily and permanently\u2019 (p. 88).  This interpretation opens the \npossibility of a Europe of multiple and mobile identities, a Europe moving \n 10\nirreversibly towards cosmopolitan attachments.  The result would give Europe a very \ndifferent common ideal, centred on defiant transnational identifications, \ndemonstrating that the original Kantian peace formula based on cosmopolitan law and \nuniversal rights can be reinvigorated to normalise and protect the idea that being \nEuropean is commensurate with celebrating nomadic identities (Joseph, 1999) and \ncultural mixture.  A new Idea of Europe, playing on \u2018cool loyalties\u2019 to the state and \n\u2018thin patterns of solidarity\u2019 (Turner, 2000: 28) across all sections of society - minority \nand majority, indigenous and migrant.   \n \nBut, all of this assumes the cosmopolitan ethos is widespread, and here, the picture of \nEurope \u2018travelling light\u2019 is mixed.  First, to return to Melucci (1996: 116), the \ncondition and consciousness of the \u2018multiple self\u2019 are two very different, possibly \nconflicting, states: \n \n\u2026 there is a profound moral implication: the necessity to keep and to lose, \nto cope with fears and resistances, but also with the ability of going \nbeyond our given identities. [...]  The possibility of meeting each other \nneeds a big leap in consciousness, to allow people to accept that they exist \nas separate individual and social groups, but no less that they can co-exist \nand communicate. \n \nWithout a \u2018big leap in consciousness\u2019 \u2013 which is unlikely as long as the European \nproject continues to breed indifference or hostility \u2013 \u2018fears and resistances\u2019 may well \ndominate reaction to a perceived erosion of boundaries and threatened national \nidentity.  Is this not one way of interpreting the contemporary resurgence of racism, \nethno-communalism, religious fundamentalism and nationalist sentiment in Europe?  \nA Europe without old certainties of belonging, exacerbating a defensive attitude to \nchange and an intolerance towards difference.  The many flashpoints, across Europe, \nof ethnic cleansing, violence towards immigrants and asylum seekers, national flag-\nwaving, regional separatism, minority demands and majority backlashes, provide \nample evidence of this possibility.  \n \nThen, there is the question of in whose name we can invoke the label hybrid or \ncosmopolitan.  In the considerable debate that there has been on this issues, Jonathan \n 11\nFriedman (1997: 79) has argued compellingly that it describes a restricted cultural \nelite \u2013 \u2018post-colonial border-crossers\u2019 such as poets, artists and intellectuals.  \nSimilarly, Robin Cohen (1998: 15) comments: \n \nThere are those who celebrate the new uncertainty principles, who explore \nthe luxuriant phenomenology of fragmentation and fluidity for their own \nnarcissistic purposes, and fetishise the borderlands as sites of cultural or \npolitical transgression; en route the migrant and asylum-seeker, the \nunemployed and the down-and-out: all those in need of \u2026 security and \nsafety \u2026 are often transfigured into a kind of nomadic postmodern hero \nby those who take all that for granted. \n \nRecently, Jan Nederveen Pieterse (2001) has responded to this type of criticism by \nreasserting that the history of human and non human life is one of layered \nhybridisation, such that the essentialisation of fixed and pure categories, rather than \nhybridity itself, is the analytical problem.  For him, ideas of hybridity highlight the \nerrors of a \u2018social proclivity to boundary fetishism\u2019 (p. 1) responsible for perpetuating \n\u2018us\u2019 versus \u2018them\u2019 thinking, while the reality remains that of ingrained mixture across \nthe social and geographical spectrum.  It may well be that hybridity is more of an \neveryday phenomenon than its critics assume, but they are right to point out that the \ncelebratory literature glosses over the material and cultural politics of many social \nworlds involved in little transgression.  One such world is that of people who find \nthemselves at the bottom of the social heap - from immigrants and migrants to \ndisaffected youths and the unemployed \u2013 often forced into enclave groups and enclave \npractices for their material and social well-being (through choice and prejudice).   \n \nBut enclavism is a more general affliction, for across the \u2018mainstream\u2019 in \u2018ordinary\u2019 \nhouseholds, neighbourhoods, workplaces and public spaces, the silent unmooring of \ncommunity and tradition by hyper-modernisation and globalisation, is reinforcing a \nstrong desire for tangible boundaries against others.  We might all be hybrids as \nPieterse claims at the level of our daily cultural practices, but few of us seem to accept \nthis, as it questions our own purity and superiority over the outsider.  Some cultural \nconflicts in Europe can be seen in these terms: as a worry of cultural loss resulting \nfrom integration, Americanised consumerism, Brussels \u2018bureaucracy\u2019, immigrants and \n 12\nasylum seekers, and the rise of ethnic and other regionalist movements.  These are \nvery real worried drawn around sharp geographical and cultural boundaries to mark \ndifference; a far cry from happy hybridity. \n \nTradition and Difference  \n \nDifference matters, and above all to minority ethnic and cultural groups.  Take aspects \nof the cultural practices of the 17 million Muslims in the EU as an example.  The \nearly sobriety, piety, and conformity of first generation Muslims (Werbner, 1996) has \nproduced nothing like Europeans or cosmopolitans with dark skins among later \ngenerations in Britain, France, Germany and other European countries (except, \npossibly, among mobile, semi-detached, liberal professionals like me).  Instead, as \nYasmin Alibhai-Brown (1998: 39) puts it: \n \nInterestingly, young, highly educated Muslims are developing a new sense \nof superiority through victimhood.  Many are attracted to the idea of \nintifada and of an unworkable, though romantic, pan-Islamic identity, and \nthat the notion that they can live within their own ideological and religious \nimaginary territories. \n \nAlibhai-Brown argues in the case of British Muslims that the spectrum seems to be \npolarised between those for whom Islamic identity matters most (with \u2018integration the \nlast thing on the minds\u2019) and young Muslims who see \u2018themselves as past of a wider \nmovement of other disenfranchised groups seeking a place for themselves in society\u2019 \n(ibid; see also Ristilammi, 1996, for a compelling account of Muslim alterity \nconstructed through such alliances in Malm\u00f6).  Either way, Europe plays no positive \nrole: \u2018except for the widespread view among black and Asian people that Europe is a \nwhite fortress against the developing world or that we here in Britain are in someways \nbetter off than those \u2018ethnic minorities\u2019 living in our partner countries, there is no \nengagement with the EU project\u2019 (Alibhai-Brown, 2000: 8-9). \n \nInstead, there is an alternative geography of affiliation at work, involving diaspora \nlinks and strong claims on the society of residence\/citizenship.  Like their parents and \ngrandparents, young Muslims see themselves as different from the national majority, \n 13\nbut unlike them, they also claim the nation as theirs.  No longer Muslims in Britain, \nFrance and Germany, but British, French and German Muslims, and for this, \nstakeholders in the national community like anybody else.  A telling aspect of the \nrecent ethnic disturbances in the towns of northern England, but also a common \nfeature of contemporary ethnic minority protest in French, German, Belgium, Dutch \nand Scandinavian cities, is that they were about more than recognition for minority \nneeds.  Instead, in claiming neighbourhoods, streets, parks and monuments as theirs, \nthe young protestors have fundamentally questioned assumptions about who owns the \npublic sphere hitherto assumed to be white majoritarian and structured around \nnational heritage bound conventions.  What seems to have most outraged local white \nresidents, the media and the national psyche is that \u2018immigrants\u2019, despite their \nlegitimate claim to national citizenship and birth, should have the audacity to alter the \nsymbols of local and national belonging, rather like asking the Queen to wear a veil.  \nIn all this, Europe remains uncannily absent as a space of affiliation, despite its \nsignificant implications for national minorities and majorities, ranging from the \nimpact of economic and monetary union on jobs and livelihoods and displacements \nassociated with the free movement of people, to centralised decision making in \nBrussels or Strasbourg over major political issues. \n \nOf course, ethnic alterity is not worn by everyone as a marker of difference, for, as \nJeff Spinner-Halev (1999: 69) notes: \n \nWhen a devout Sikh serves as a Canadian Mounty, eats hamburgers at \nhome, attends Toronto Blue Jay baseball games on the weekends, and \nwhen his children attend the University of Toronto where they partake in \ntheir own form of cosmopolitan life, then he and his family are living the \ncosmopolitan life, one that draws on several cultural traditions. \n \nBut we should not get too carried away.  Accompanying the cosmopolitanism \nconsumption comes ethnic loyalty as a source of communal security and cultural \nnourishment.  This is precisely why, with every step towards national and European \ncultural assimilation, has grown the demand for denominational schools, cultural and \nreligious autonomy, travel to the \u2018homeland\u2019 or stories of \u2018home\u2019, and reconstructions \nof family and diaspora histories (Werbner, 1996).  Such desires need not be read as \n 14\nisolationist rejection of the mainstream, as often depicted in the mass media, but as \nendorsement of strongly felt shared ethno-cultural affiliations.  In as much as \u2018cultures \nare internally plural and represent a continuing conversation between their different \ntraditions and strands of thought\u2019 (Parekh, 2000: 337), it is also a truism that \u2018human \nbeings \u2026 live within a culturally structured world and \u2026 place considerable value on \ntheir cultural identity\u2019 (p. 336).   \n \nMuch more worryingly, the discourse of ethno-cultural difference is playing into the \nhands of fundamentalists who demand a Europe of blood-and-soil based territorial \nbelonging, cleansed of immigrants and \u2018foreign\u2019 cultural influences.  Racism and \nxenophobia have become trans-European phenomena, no longer restricted to \nindividual nations which can be conveniently dismissed as exceptions to an otherwise \nintact European tradition of equal rights, freedom and solidarity.  The naked racism of \ntwenty to thirty years ago against non-white immigrants in Britain, France and \nGermany, played on the allegedly \u2018different endowments of human races\u2019 (Stolcke, \n1995) as a basis for discrimination and violence against particular immigrant ethnic \nminorities (Turks, Indians, Pakistanis, Afro-Caribbeans, North Africans) in housing \nand labour markets, access to various political and social rights and on the streets and \nthe media.  Some of this continues to remain \u2013 perhaps in less naked form and among \nconsciously racist individuals and organisations \u2013 but it has also spread to countries of \nmore recent immigration.  Many of these early horrors have been replicated in Italian \nresponses to immigration from diverse African countries in the 1980s (Melotti, 1997) \nas well as in Swedish and Danish reactions to liberal asylum policies towards \npersecuted peoples around the world.  As so aptly captured in the title of Allan Pred\u2019s \n(2000) book, racism in its various permutations is now evident Even in Sweden, the \ncradle of progressive social democracy and liberal values.   \n \nBut a new racism, more accurately a new \u2018cultural fundamentalism\u2019 (Stolcke, 1995) \nthat plays on cultural difference as a justification for ethnic separation, has grown as a \npan-European phenomenon, in both old and new countries of immigration (Modood, \n1997).  While the old form was all about keeping immigrants out or sending them \nback as undesirable or ill-fitting aliens, the new phenomenon expresses anxieties \nabout the negative implications \u2013 both for \u2018us\u2019 and \u2018them\u2019 of \u2018having them in our \nmidst\u2019.  They and their cultural practices \u2013 from worship and ideology to consumption \n 15\nand recreation \u2013 will dilute and undermine our sacred traditions and our ethno-\nnational integrity.  As Verena Stolcke (1995: 12) summarises: \n \nContemporary cultural fundamentalism unequivocally roots nationality \nand citizenship in a shared cultural heritage. \u2026 The assumption that the \nterritorial state and its people are founded on a cultural heritage that is \nbounded, compact, and distinctive is a constitutive part \u2026 \n \nEven declared xenophobes and nationalists \u2013 increasingly drawing on all sorts of \nwhite-black alliances - have become cultural relativists alongside ordinary folk, \nfighting campaigns to rescue national or regional cultural heritage, complaining about \nencroachment from Europe, worrying about the threat posed by the rights claims of \nminorities (e.g. special schools, recognition of festivals, holidays and customs, \nfunding for associations) and suggesting ways of keeping the ethnic communities \nseparate (from ghettoisation to voluntary repatriation and tight immigration controls).  \nThe new mood works less on the exclusionary politics of genus, than one based on \nloyalty to national cultural stereotypes, with the right of membership possibly \nspanning across ethnic boundaries (e.g. that cricket loving Indians support England at \na test match against India, or Palestinians wave the ubiquitous national flag in \nDenmark or gather around Swedish maypoles wild-eyed with enthusiasm on May-\nday).  Now, the test of belonging is based on culture rather than colour and feature, \nbut it is just as exclusionary and just as intolerant of cultural mixture.   \n \nTo summarise, viewed from a range of subject-positions, the new Europe of porous \nborders seems less a space of happy hybridity, cosmopolitanism, and \u2018old\u2019 European \nvalues, than one of exclusions of varying intensity in the name of cultural difference.  \nIndeed, ironically, the new cultural fundamentalism often draws on the same politics \nof difference as found in progressive arguments in favour of recognising multicultural \nrights and group autonomy.  As Jeff Spinner-Halev (1999: 65) argues: \n \nA multiculturalism that tries to create a society with several distinctive \ncultures deeply threatens citizenship.  In this kind of multicultural society, \npeople are not interested in citizenship; they are not interested in making \nthe state a better place for all; they care little about how public policies \n 16\naffect most people or about their fellow citizens.  Even the term \u201cfellow \ncitizen\u201d might strike them as strange.  What they have are fellow Jews, or \nfellow blacks, or fellow Muslims, or fellow Sikhs.  Citizens, however, are \nnot their fellows. \n \nIn this cultural context, the old Idea of Europe seems particularly inappropriate as a \nsymbol of cultural unity and dialogue. \n \nAnother Idea of Europe \n \nWhat is it to be European in a space of marked mobility and transience, multicultural \npresence from around the world, and weak attachments to a place called Europe?  Is it \nworth reinventing Europe as an ideal or should this aspiration be buried under a \npragmatism in the service of European economic and political integration, leaving \nsocial and cultural matters to local and national resolutions?  Is the politics of \ndifference \u2013 nationalist, diasporic, or pluralist - the best we can hope for, to be \ncontested at the level of the nation state and other spheres of meaningful affiliation \nand engagement with others?   \n \nI strongly believe that it is worth reinventing the Idea of Europe, because every step of \nintegration brings shared problems and developments that require a common standard, \nand because it can claim in the name of Europe a new transnational ideal of social \njustice, belonging, and cultural tolerance.  But it is not the \u2018Europeanness\u2019 of Europe \nthat I wish to defend - long standing common cultural habits such as Catholic charity, \nthe Protestant ethic, or pasta and Beethoven.  Instead, what I want to defend is a \ncertain ethos, one of empathy for the stranger and of becoming through interaction, \nsupported by a framework of rights that draw upon elements of European political \nphilosophy, including the Enlightenment ideal of universal freedoms and the French \nRevolution ideal of an equal and solidaristic society.  Pitched at this level, the \ndiscussion involves a return to certain abstract principles of political philosophy and \ntheir amendment and extension, in order to push Europe\u2019s multicultures in new \ndirections.  As such, it carries no heavy baggage of European cultural traditions \nimposed over a reluctant cosmopolitan, Americanised, nation-centred or diasporic \npopulace, but it does require a commitment to political community \u2018bound by the ties \n 17\nof common interest and affection\u2019 (Parekh, 2000: 341) that is far from easy to \ninculcate and achieve.   \n \nAccording to Julia Kristeva (   ), there is a \u2018European vision of freedom\u2019 or \u2018concept \nof human dignity\u2019 (p. 43) that is quite distinct from the American liberal tradition of \nrights and freedoms which she ties to the utility and calculus of science and economic \nadvancement.  She speculates that the European \u2018social experience\u2019 and \u2018way of \nthinking\u2019 (p. 40) may be based on: \n \nThe intimate, the particular, the art of living, taste (g\u00f4ut), leisure (loisirs), \npleasure without purpose (plaisirs pour rien), grace, (gr\u00e2ce), the \nincidental (le hasard), playfulness (le ludisme), wastefulness (gaspillage), \nour \u2018damned side\u2019 (la part maudite), or, to cut it short, freedom as the \nessence of \u2018the being in the world\u2019 prior to any \u2018cause\u2019. (p. 42). \n \nI am not convinced by the distinction that Kristeva wishes to make between a \nutilitarian America and a poetic Europe, or by her cultural descriptors of \nEuropeanness (though I agree that they desperately need recovering in our age of fast \nconsumption and calculative organisation).  Instead, it is the \u2018idea of being in the \nworld prior to any cause\u2019 that I find attractive as a philosophical core for a \nmulticultural Europe.  Kristeva again: \n \nThere is \u2026 another vision of freedom that emerges in the Greek world, at \nthe very heart of its philosophy with the pre-Socratics, and which \ndevelops in the Socratic dialogue.  Without becoming subordinate to a \ncause, that is, previous to the concatenation of Aristotelian \u2018categories\u2019 \nthat are already a premise for scientific and technical thinking, this \nfundamental freedom relies on being and, moreover, on the being of \nlanguage that is being delivered (l\u2019etre de la parole qui se livre), which \ndelivers to itself and to the other, and thus sets itself free (p. 40, original \nemphasis). \n \nHospitality and mutuality revisited \n 18\n Two fundamental principles for a new Idea of Europe spring from this social \nontology, abstract principles that have to do with the standard of human dignity and \ncultural respect in Europe, rather than the common cultural traditions of the European \npeople.  It could be objected that the discussion of a unitary project at this level is \nunnecessarily foundational, but the unsavoury truth is that it is necessitated by the \ngrowing indignities we are witnessing in Europe heaped upon asylum seekers, third \ncountry immigrants, Muslims; indignities often questioning not only their right of \npresence but also their basic human rights.   \n \nThe first is the principle of hospitality, which Kristeva links etymologically to the \noriginal Greek word ethos, meaning the habit of regular stay or shelter.  This is an \ninspiring and relevant ethos for a Europe distinguished by global ethnic and cultural \nmixture and intense human mobility:  the Idea of Europe as hospitality towards the \nstranger.  For Kristeva, \u2018we can build something from this solidarity because we all \nbelong to a future type of humanity that will be made entirely of foreigners\/strangers \nthat try to understand each other\u2019 (p. 35).  Jacques Derrida (2001) has proposed that in \nEurope, a practical step towards would be a return to the medieval idea of cities as \nsites of asylum and refuge (interestingly, he considers states far too enmeshed in the \nculture of vilification of non-citizens): cities that once again can offer the outsider \nnow seen as \u2018guest\u2019 a safe haven through the rights of visitation and residence (see \nalso Conley, 2002 for an argument on why European cities are especially suitable for \nthis role).   \n \nWe should go much further, however, for there is work to be done at the spatial scale \nof Europe itself, in order to ensure that the ethos of hospitality does not end up \nbecoming restricted to a small number of urban safe havens, while the rest of Europe \ncarries on as usual.  The figure of the refugee \u2013 now a mass figure in Europe, but with \nvirtually no rights \u2013 should force a radical rethinking of the modern standard of \nconferring full rights through national citizenship. What sense does it make that \nEurope continues to restrict the rights of its growing army of non-citizens, and worse \nstill, since 9\/11, question their very human rights in the so-called war against \nterrorism (Bauman, 2002)? In a new Idea of Europe, the principle of refuge, not \n 19\nnational citizenship, could become the central right of recognition, as Giorgio \nAgamben (2000: 23-24) demands: \n \nWe could conceive of Europe not as an impossible \u2018Europe of the \nnations\u2019, whose catastrophe one can already foresee in the short run, but \nrather as an aterritorial or extraterritorial space in which all the (citizen \nand noncitizen) residents of European states would be in a position of \nexodus or refuge; the status of European would then mean the being-in-\nexodus of the citizen (a condition that obviously could also be one of \nimmobility).  European space would thus mark an irreducible difference \nbetween birth [nascita] and nation in which the old concept of people \u2026 \ncould again find a political meaning, thus decidedly opposing itself to the \nconcept of nation .... This space would coincide neither with any of the \nhomogeneous national territories nor with their topographical sum, but \nwould rather act on them by articulating and perforating them \ntopologically as in the Klein bottle or the M\u00f6bius strip, where exterior and \ninterior in-determine each other.  In this new space, European cities would \nrediscover their ancient vocation of cities of the world by entering into a \nrelation of reciprocal extraterritoriality. \n \nI will return to the question of what kind of rights, and for whom, in the next section. \n \nThe second principle for a new Idea of Europe that can be taken from Kristeva is \npublicity for mutuality as the keystone of cultural constitution in a multiethnic \nEurope.  A familiar refrain in contemporary cultural theory and postcolonial writing is \nthat identities are mutually and dialogically constituted.  This is an important premise \nto situate the social psychology of hospitality itself, which could quite easily be \nreduced to a requirement of tolerance\/pity\/empathy on the part of those who are \nsecure and who play the role of host towards the stranger as a needy or destitute \nfigure, which, as such, continues to carry a whole baggage of European moral \nsuperiority with it.  Equally, hospitality could be read as \u2018unconditional responsibility \nfor the other\u2019, arising \u2018as a response to fragility and suffering, intimated \u2026 in the \nsilent command addressed to me by the other, convoking me to justice and love\u2019 \n(Venn, 2002: 76), a reading that too is never that far from judgements of moral \n 20\nobligation towards the wretched.  In contrast, entangled with the principle of \nmutuality, hospitality is rendered a two-way process, a relationship of openings and \nrecognition, as Mustafa Dikec (2002) argues, based on \u2018giving spaces to the stranger \nwhere recognition on both sides would be possible\u2019 (p. 229, emphasis in original).  \nThe upshot is that: \n \nHospitality is not about the rules of stay being conditioned by a duality of \nhost and guest with unequal power relations leading to domination; it is \nabout a recognition that we are hosts and guests at the same time in \nmultiple and shifting ways.  Hospitality, in this sense, is a refusal to \nconceive the host and the guest as pre-constituted identities.  It is about \nthe recognition that they are mutually constitutive of each other, and thus, \nrelational and shifting as all identities are (Dikec, 2002: 239). \n \nBut, note that the effects of co-constitution are not straightforward.  Our embodiment \nof mobile and multiple identities through our varied interactions with others and with \ndiverse cultural influences in a globalising world rubs against our need for the \nstranger and strangeness as a boundary object; as not me, as the undesirable or \ndifferent other.  The stranger is in us but also not one of us.  This paradox is \nbeautifully captured in the following passage which captures the ambivalent questions \nof belonging raised by the presence of an age-old traditional Arab scribe writing \nletters for the illiterate, perched on a street-corner in the centre of fast, modern, Paris: \nWhat to make of the right of presence in Europe of this stranger?  Why, indeed, refer \nto him as the stranger? \n \nWearing sandals, a turban, wrapped in a djellaba against the autumnal \nchill, sitting opposite a brand new school, a multicoloured tubular-steeled \npiece of postmodern architecture, the immobile dignity of this public \nwriter emphasises the disturbing presence of the stranger.  His pen, his \nlanguage, his being, is coeval with mine,  I could turn away and pretend \nthat he no longer exists; that he is merely a quaint remnant of yesterday\u2019s \nimmigration from the \u2018Third World\u2019, from the Maghreb.  I can choose to \nsee in his presence merely the intrusion of the exotic and the archaic in the \nmundane of modernity.  But I can also register a trace, not merely of \n 21\nanother world largely hidden from my eyes and understanding, but rather \nthe trace of a language and history that seeks a response, and a \nresponsibility, in mine.  Apparently a foreigner, this, too, is clearly his city \n\u2013 certainly more than it is \u2018mine\u2019.  Forced to consider the composite \nrealisation of modern space as it comes into being in this cosmopolitan \nplace called Paris, I also register the alterity that is both integral to it and \nto the modernity I presume to possess.  For the Arab scribe sitting \npatiently on the corner of a modern, Western city is not a historical \naccident.  Separate, yet indissolubly linked, his presence both interrupts \nand reconfigures my history, translating the closure of my \u2018identity\u2019 into \nan aperture in which I meet another who is in the world yet irreducible to \nmy will (Chambers, 2001: 205-6). \n \nFor Iain Chambers, the challenge of recognition and cultural openness requires a \ndifferent subjectivity and language, an ethos of journey and incertitude, of acceptance \nthat to be European is to inhabit a \u2018site that will perpetually cite the unhomely, the \nuncanny\u2019, drawing \u2018from history a politics of fulfilment whose outcome is never \nknown in advance\u2019 (op cit: 207).  Similarly, Luce Irigaray (2002: 141) suggests that \nmutuality requires knowledge of \u2018how to intertwine love of the same and love of the \nother, faithfulness to self and becoming with the other\u2019, so that \u2018cultural fertility \u2026 \nwould result from listening and the effects of mixing\u2019.  This is a tall order, calling \nforth a certain ethical or behavioural consciousness to which few will wish to commit \nor know how to commit.  Europe as the moment \u2013 with all its talk of market freedom, \nindividual advancement, impermeable borders - seems to be in no mood to replicate \nthe kinds of cultural experiment launched by the New Left and the student movement \nin 1968.  Indeed, Irigaray too acknowledges that this is a \u2018new agenda, for which we \nlack the training\u2019 (p. 141).   \n \n\u2026 Beyond the inter-subjective \n \nPerhaps the challenge, then, is to take up the principle of mutuality at a level beyond \nthe inter-subjective, but as a framing condition for the latter, through its incorporation \ninto a new political philosophy for Europe that \u2018accept[s] the reality and desirability \nof cultural diversity\u2019, but whose \u2018constant concern is to keep the dialogue going and \n 22\nnurture a climate in which it can proceed effectively, stretch the boundaries of the \nprevailing forms of thought, and generate a body of collectively acceptable principles, \ninstitutions and policies\u2019 ((Parekh, 2000: 340).  Living with others, thus, requires \ncollective endorsement and enforcement through certain shared political rules and \nvalues.   \n \nFor Parekh, two political philosophies can contribute: liberalism, through its emphasis \non the rights and freedoms of the individual, underpinned by certain institutional \npreconditions such as freedom of expression, basic ethical norms and a responsive \nstructure of authority; and a dialogic multiculturalism, based on rights and freedoms \nof group identities and cultures, coupled to \u2018essential political virtues as mutual \nrespect and concern, tolerance, self-restraint, willingness to enter into unfamiliar \nworlds of thought \u2026 and the ability to persuade and live with unresolved differences\u2019 \n(op cit: 340).  A new Idea of Europe could endorse this dual philosophy, and by doing \nso, unsettle the prevailing nationalist imaginaries in whose name so much damage is \ncurrently inflicted on immigrants and other strangers demonised for their race and \nethnicity. \n \nBut there is more.  Embedded in the principle of living with\/becoming through others \nlies a commitment, in a Deleuzian sense, to a \u2018diagrammatic\u2019 rather than a \n\u2018programmatic\u2019 politics; one that explores the potentialities of \u2018making visible \nsomething unseen\u2019 (Rajchman, 1999: 42) and accepts the future as a \u2018question of \nnovelty\u2019 (op. cit.: 46).  No pursuit of a pre-determined idea of the good life in a new \nEurope.  Agonism, or the democratic clash of an equal and empowered public, as the \nsubstance and goal of political engagement is a key concept here.  This shifts the \nemphasis from a pre-given idea of being European to the idea of becoming European, \nconfident that the juxtaposition of heterogeneity can unlock a \u2018process of becoming \nsomething other, we know not yet what\u2019 (op. cit.: 48), hopeful that empathy emerges \nfrom: \n  \nan attachment to that which differs from you growing out of glimmers of \ndifference in you, an attachment that takes the form of forbearance in \nstrife and generosity in interdependence rather than a quest to close up the \ndistance between you through formation of a higher unity. \u2026 This ethos \n 23\nof agonistic respect amidst a world of dissonant interdependencies is \ncrucial to the fabric of democratic politics: \u2026 it folds a pathos of distance \ninto democratic relations of contestation, collaboration and hegemony \n(Connolly, 1993: 195, cited in Schrift, 2000: 156). \n \nFor all the reasons discussed in this paper, there is no guarantee of a \u2018pathos of \ndistance\u2019 in a free market of multicultural engagement in Europe, but as theorists of \nradical democracy have suggested, a public sphere that openly acknowledges the right \nof difference and also offers ample opportunity for the less powerful to stake - and \nwin - their claims (with the help of rules such as those suggested above by Parekh) \ncan constructively channel adversarial politics.  A European public sphere shaped \nalong these lines would advocate \u2018a plurality of forms of being a democratic citizen\u2019 \n(Mouffe, 2000: 73), and \u2018a shared adhesion to the ethico-political principles of liberal \ndemocracy: liberty and equality\u2019 (p. 102), so that cultural politics can be played out as \na contest between friendly enemies (agonism) rather than antagonists.  What is crucial \nis that in such a political space outcomes are tied to the process of participation itself; \nno model citizen, no teleology, no essentialised idea of what it is to be European.   \n \nThis signals a Europe of \u2018minor politics\u2019, following Gilles Deleuze\u2019s distinction \nbetween minority and minor politics.  While minority politics is often a politics of \nrecognition, relying on fictive ethnicity, a minor politics assumes that \u2018in some sense \nwe are all potentially from a strange \u201cnowhere\u201d prior to \u201cterritorial\u201d definitions\u2019, a \n\u2018people to come\u2019 (Rajchman, 1999: 50).  The disruption of national(ist) state \ndemocracy by European integration and globalisation, provides a perfect opportunity \nfor such a reinvention of the political, introducing \u2018into the concept of democracy the \nas yet unrepresentable \u201ctime\u201d of minority\u2019 (op. cit: 52).  The promise that Europe is a \n\u2018people to come\u2019, \u2018fundamentally incomplete, a postcolonial locus of multiple \ndiasporas\u2019 (Werbner, 1997: 263).   \n \nBack to the Commons \n \nThese tracings of another Idea of Europe carry powerful symbolic value, which, \nhowever, without appropriate practical actions will fail to find popular support.  I \nwant to argue in this final section that a small but significant practical step towards \n 24\nEurope as a post-national polity is the deepening and extension (to residents, not just \ncitizens) of constitutionally protected universal rights.  These are rights from which \nfollow material protections and benefits, and through this, the possibility of a \n\u2018constitutional patriotism\u2019 (Habermas, 1998) towards Europe as well as a commons \ncapable of sustaining agonistic invention.   \n \nA place to start is the upward harmonisation of political, social and economic rights \nand standards as universal rights that are seen by people to offer material benefits \nfrom European citizenship.  The different member states discriminate differentially \nbetween their own or EU nationals and non-nationals in the offer of rights.  They vary \nin their policies and attitudes towards immigration from beyond the EU.  They offer \ndifferent welfare rights (from health coverage to education and benefits) as well as \neconomic rights (e.g. minimum wage, industrial relations, coverage for part-time \nworkers).  They vary in their treatment of ethnic minorities (e.g. autonomism in the \nNetherlands, cultural tolerance in Britain, assimilation into the national imaginary in \nFrance).  It is hardly surprising that, for example, the Scandinavians fear the Union as \na drain on high domestic welfare standards and the British worry about the loss of \npolitical freedom, and the European \u2018South\u2019 see the Union as a way of enhancing \ndomestic welfare rights, while all the national majorities see immigrants as a further \ndrain on resources, \u2018taking from \u201cus\u201d to give to \u201cthem\u201d\u2019 Markoff, 1999: 32)  EU-level \nuniversal rights might help to moderate such politics of envy, in addition to giving \npeople with multiple loyalties a good reason for wanting to be part of the European \nproject.   \n \nBut, to return to an earlier theme, who should be entitled to the rights \u2013 citizens of the \nEU alone or also residents without EU citizenship?  This is a vexed and much debated \nquestion in the literature on rights in the Union, but I am inclined to agree with \nYasemin Soysal (1994) that if the interests of immigrants are to be taken seriously, \nthe rights of citizenship should be decoupled from their national constitution and \noffered, instead, as trans-territorial rights of person-hood based on residence rather \nthan citizenship in the EU.  Similarly, Rainer Baub\u00f6ck (1995) has argued that all \nforeigners should enjoy all political rights as soon as they satisfy residency \nrequirements.  In other words, residents would carry with them the same bundle of \nrights within the EU and eligibility would no longer depend on national citizenship, \n 25\nthe acquisition of which is notoriously difficult for immigrants, not least because of its \nmany more guarantees compared to residency status alone.  \n \nThis controversial proposal does not come without its own difficulties, such as the \npossibility of fortress-like policing of who is allowed into Europe or stricter residency \nrules and intrusive checks on compliance.  But, on the other hand, it does equalise the \nstatus of all those who find themselves resident in Europe.  As Gerald Delanty (1997: \n299) notes: \n \nIf residence is more fully established as the basis of European citizenship, \nthe dimension of inclusion can be enhanced.  European citizenship could \nthen become not merely relevant to the some 5 million citizens of the \nmember states living in other states of the Union, but also to the some 10 \nto 15 million immigrants. \n \nThis equalisation of status, and the geographic and cultural mobility it offers, might \nalso help to loosen the strong ties and loyalties to nation that has been encouraged \nhistorically by the coupling of rights to national citizenship.  It might, as Turner hopes \n(2000: 30), inculcate an \u2018ideology of membership which will celebrate the uncertainty \nof belonging where our \u201cfinal vocabularies\u201d are never final\u2019.  In this way, loyalty and \ncommitment may become the product of travel and mobility in a Europe of peripatetic \ncitizenship. \n \nWhat kind of rights might be included in an EU-model of post-national citizenship?  \nSoysal has largely human rights in mind, but the coverage can be extended to include \nother rights \u2013 political, economic, and social.  To my mind, welfare rights are central \namong these in terms of their offer of immediate material benefits as well as the \nchange to become someone or something else through education, shelter, health-care, \nand so on.  Gerald Delanty (1997: 293) argues, \u2018unless the European Union can \nreproduce the welfare state on a supranational level \u2026 there is little point in making \npleas for a meaningful kind of European citizenship\u2019.  Interestingly, however, the \nmissing words in Delanty\u2019s claim are \u2018a very unlikely prospect\u2019, and I am inclined to \nagree with the view that throughout the history of European integration, national \ngovernments have jealously defended their control over welfare decisions as a tool of \n 26\nfiscal and electoral control.  But we may be at a time when, with increased mobility, \nimmigrant presence, welfare variety (on a downward slide) within the EU, there is \nstronger popular support for a European welfare state.   \n \nThis is not the place for discussing the details of which welfare rights might be pooled \nand which retained at the national level.  I wish simply to make the basic point that \nthere is much to be gained for inter-culturalism in Europe through a new EU model of \ncitizenship based on trans-European universal rights.  It strikes me as less divisive \nthan any attempt to force people to conform to a pre-given Idea of Europe, and more \ninclusive than never-ending recognition of group-differentiated rights and identities.  \n \nConclusion \n \nAt the moment, there is a glimmer of inter-governmental interest in a Europe of the \ncommons supported by enhanced universal rights.  The European Charter on \nFundamental rights has strengthened the protection of human rights, and in doing so \nextended coverage to non-citizens.  In turn, Article 21 prohibits discrimination based \non sex, colour, ethnic and social origin, language and religious belief.  It could \nprovide some of the freedoms necessary for Europe as a space of experimentation \ntowards a new model of belonging and becoming.  But, it is only a small step and one \nsurrounded by many more EU and national violations of the freedom and potential of \nthe stranger. \n \nA Europe of the commons \u2013 including the principles enshrined in the new European \nConstitution -  will have to cease being a Europe of toothless declarations.  For one, \nthe threat of racism and xenophobia is real, frightening, and culturally regressive.  I \nconsider it a failing that while the member states have rushed to unite in tightening \nEU borders on the grounds that excess immigration poses a threat to security and \nexhausts scarce welfare resources (even if economic migrants are grudgingly \nwelcomed), they have not taken decisive action to punish racism and tackle other \nforms of cultural  fundamentalism.  Since the late 1980s, the European Parliament has \nproduced inspiring declarations against racism in Europe, there is some wonderful \nbinding legislation against racism (e.g. Article 13), there is close monitoring of \nincidences of racism and xenophobia, and the Commission has put forward many \n 27\nproposals for directives to protect displaced persons, third country nationals who are \nlong term residents, and refugees or asylum seekers.  Yet, these seem to be rarely \ninvoked, and action is left largely to national governments, who, in turn, have not \npressed as strongly as they could for effective EU-wide action, possibly because this \nleaves them the option of using national anti-racist policies for appeasement \u2018at home\u2019 \nand vilification of other nations in the Union.   \n \nOf course, Craig Calhoun (2002) is right in noting that a constitutional patriotism \nbased on \u2018thin identities and normative universalism\u2019 (p. 157) supported by a regime \nof rights such as those described in the last part of this paper, will not \u2018achieve a \nsufficient solidarity to be truly motivating for its members\u2019 (ibid.).  As Calhoun \nargues, the latter requires an active, plural and agonistic public sphere beyond the \nstate and its regimes of rules, working as a living \u2018realm of cultural creativity as well \nas rational discourse, and a realm of mutual engagement\u2019 (p. 171), so that \u2018new ways \nof imagining identity, interests, and solidarity\u2019 (ibid) are daily fashioned, thus \nallowing the \u2018nature of life together [to be] chosen as it is constructed\u2019 (ibid, \nemphasis in original).  On the other hand, it is also surely the case that a Europe of the \nminorities and minor belongings, stripped free of an old baggage of Eurocentric \nvalues, also requires a regime of extended constitutional rights. \n 28\nAcknowldgements \n \nThis paper develops and extend arguments first published in Amin (2001).
