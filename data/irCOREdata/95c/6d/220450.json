However, growing old comes with a number of challenges which can\ncompromise the quality of care and support they are able to provide, particularly for children infected by HIV\nand enrolled on antiretroviral therapy (ART) programmes. For ART to be effective, and for infected children not\nto develop drug-resistance, a complex treatment regimen must be followed. Drawing on the perspectives of 25\nnurses and eight grandparents of HIV-infected children in Manicaland, eastern Zimbabwe, we explore some of\nthe challenges faced by grandparents in sustaining children\u2019s adherence to ART. These challenges, serving as\nbarriers to paediatric ART, are poverty, immobility, deteriorating memory and poor comprehension of complex\ntreatments. Although older HIV-infected children were found to play an active role in sustaining the adherence to\ntheir programme of treatment by contributing to income and food generating activities and reminding their\nguardians about check-ups and drug administration, such contribution was not available from younger children.\nThere is therefore an urgent need to develop ART services that both take into consideration the needs of elderly\nguardians and acknowledge and enhance the agency of older children as active and responsible contributors to\nART adherence.\nKeywords: paediatric AIDS; anti-retroviral therapy; adherence; elderly guardians; Zimbabwe\nIntroduction\nThe last couple of years has seen unprecedented\nprogress in the availability of antiretroviral therapy\n(ART) in sub-Saharan Africa (WHO, UNAIDS, &\nUNICEF, 2009), not least in Zimbabwe where both\nprimary care and hospital-based HIV services are\nreaching some of the most isolated communities. As a\nresult 215,000 (57% of those living with AIDS) people\nare estimated to access ART in Zimbabwe, with more\npeople enrolling every day (UNAIDS, 2010). A\nsurvey carried out in 2008 estimates that 13% of all\npatients receiving HIV care from the health services in\nZimbabwe are between 0 and 19 years of age, of which\n33% are aged 0\u00014; 25% are between 5\u00019 years; 25%,\n10\u000114 years; and 17%, 15\u000119 years (Ferrand et al.,\n2010). As the fight against HIV and AIDS continues,\nit is imperative that antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) are\naccessible and that virologic suppression remains\nhigh. Virologic efficacy, or \u2018\u2018good adherence\u2019\u2019, is\nbetter achieved if patients stick to their ART regimen\nfor 95% of the time (Attaran, 2007). Good adherence\nminimises resistance to affordable first-line drugs\n(Barth et al., 2011; Tanuri et al., 2002) but has been\nidentified as a challenge for HIV-infected children\nand adolescents on ART (Arrive et al., 2005;\nBikaako-Kajura et al., 2006; Fassinou et al., 2004,\n2010; Polisset, Ametonou, Arrive, Aho, & Perez,\n2009; Weigel et al., 2009). The Zimbabwean survey\ncarried out by Ferrand and colleagues (2010) asked\nclinic staff from all ART distribution centres in the\ncountry about common problems faced by children\nand adolescents in accessing and adhering to HIV\ncare regimens. They found that for young children (0\u0001\n5), malnutrition, lack of appropriate drugs, erratic\ndrug taking and hospital visits, orphanhood and\ncaregiver issues (e.g., elderly, ill or unsupportive\ncaregivers) were common challenges to children\u2019s\nadherence to ART. For adolescents (10\u000119), erratic\ndrug taking was also a major obstacle to adherence, as\nwas lack of disclosure and poor use of counselling and\npsychosocial services (Ferrand et al., 2010). With the\nobjective of developing an understanding of these\nobstacles to ART adherence, as well as investigating\nthe interconnections between obstacles to ART ad-\nherence and the age of children\u2019s caregivers, our focus\nwill be on children who have outlived their parents\nand live with elderly guardians who also act as their\ntreatment partner.\nAlthough elderly people have been found to play\na crucial role in providing care and support for\nadults infected with HIV (Knodel & Zimmer, 2007),\n*Corresponding author.

Whilst many studies have already\nexplored the care and living arrangements of or-\nphaned children and their elderly guardians, these\nstudies have a tendency to highlight how elderly\nguardians selflessly take on the burden of caring for\norphaned and AIDS-affected children \u0001 often at the\nexpense of their own health and well-being. Elderly\nguardians for example are reported to struggle with\nfinancial difficulties (Nyambedha et al., 2003) and\nsuffer from psychosocial distress (Boon, James et al.,\n2010; Boon, Ruiter et al., 2010; Oburu & Palmerus,\n2003, 2005; Ssengonzi, 2007). Whilst this may\ncertainly also be the case of the elderly guardians\nparticipating in this study, we believe there is a need\nto be realistic about the capabilities of elderly\nguardians, particularly in relation to their role in\nsustaining the ART adherence of HIV-infected\nchildren under their care \u0001 often under very difficult\nconditions. Furthermore, we also believe that such\nstudies only give one side of the story. Reflecting\ndominant ideological understandings of children as\npassive beings in need of adult support and guidance\n(cf. Hutchby & Moran-Ellis, 1998; James, Jenks, &\nProut, 1998), they generally begin with the view of\nchildren as the problem (\u2018\u2018the burden\u2019\u2019) and adults as\nthe solution (\u2018\u2018the burdened\u2019\u2019). We seek to move\nbeyond this conception, building on studies that\nhave highlighted the reciprocity of care and support\nwithin such households (Abebe & Skovdal,\n2010; Skovdal, 2010). Although elderly guardians\ndo \u0001 very importantly \u0001 provide orphaned and HIV-\ninfected children with a home and place of belong-\ning, their old age, illness and fragility may limit their\ncontribution towards income and food generation,\nmeaning they depend on the contribution and active\nparticipation of children in sustaining their liveli-\nhoods (Skovdal, 2010) and in some cases health\n(Skovdal, Ogutu, Aoro, & Campbell, 2009).\nIn this paper we extend this line of thinking by\nexamining the challenges faced by elderly guardians \u0001\nand the participation of children themselves \u0001 in\nsustaining the ART adherence of HIV-infected chil-\ndren under their foster care. This is an area of concern\nonly previously mentioned in passing (e.g., Ferrand\net al., 2010; Meyers et al., 2007; Raiman, Michaels,\nNuttall, & Eley, 2008). In South Africa for example,\nboth Meyers et al. (2007) and Raiman et al. (2008)\nreport that elderly guardians have practical difficul-\nties in administering ARV medication due to their\ncompromised visual and arithmetic skills. It is against\nthis background, and in our interest to support\nelderly guardians in their efforts to sustain ART\nadherence in children, that we seek to explore the\nquestion: what challenges do elderly guardians face in\ncontexts of poverty, AIDS and limited social services\nas they act as the treatment partners of children on\nART? In exploring this question we hope gain\nknowledge that can help us develop programmes\nthat better support the efforts of elderly guardians to\nprovide the best possible treatment support for\nchildren under their care.\nMethodology\nThis research forms part of an on-going study which\nwas granted ethical approval from the Medical\nResearch Council of Zimbabwe (A\/681) and Imperial\nCollege London (ICREC_9_3_13). Informed and\nwritten consent was gathered from all research\nparticipants with the agreement that their identities\nwould not be revealed. Pseudonyms have therefore\nbeen used throughout.\nStudy population and sampling\nThe study was conducted in three rural communities\nin Manicaland province of eastern Zimbabwe. The\nprovince is characterised by high levels of poverty and\nHIV. The three rural communities involved in this\nstudy are all served by rural hospitals or health clinics\nthat distribute ART. This paper draws on the\nperspectives of 25 nurses and eight elderly guardians\nof children enrolled onto an ART programme.\nAlthough 30 guardians of children with HIV partici-\npated in the larger study, these eight guardians (the\nonly guardians over the age of 50 participating in our\nstudy) all referred to their old age as a major physical\nand economic constraint to children\u2019s ART adher-\nence and therefore qualify for inclusion in this paper.\nAll guardians of HIV-infected children were recruited\nthrough a mix of purposeful, snowball (using village\ncommunity health workers) and opportunistic (self-\nselected informants) sampling, and in so doing\nactively sought to identify and recruit some elderly\nguardians. The age of the elderly guardians (all\nfemale) ranged from 52 to 79, with a mean age of 61.\nThe 25 nurses participating in this study were\nrecruited from three health clinics on the basis of their\nwillingness to participate. The nurses had a variety of\nexperiences and came with different backgrounds,\nright from primary care and outreach programmes to\nHIV testing, ART distribution and palliative care.\nThe nurses tend to live within the compounds of the\nhospital and have received training on the adminis-\ntration of paediatric ART. The mean age of the 25\nnurses (11 female, 14 male) participating in the study\nwas 40.\n958 M. Skovdal et al.\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [L\nSE\n L\nibr\nary\n] a\nt 0\n4:5\n2 2\n4 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n2 \nData collection and analysis\nThe data for this study were collected in October and\nNovember 2009. Four experienced fieldworkers con-\nducted 26 in-depth interviews (18 with nurses and\neight with elderly guardians) and one focus group\ndiscussion with seven nurses in the local Shona\nlanguage. The semi-structured topic guides used for\nthe elderly guardians covered informants\u2019 personal\nbackground, their experiences of AIDS, stigma and\nbeing a treatment partners as well as problems and\nfacilitators of children\u2019s ART access and adherence.\nIndividual and group nurse interviews used the same\ntopic guide. The topic guide asked the nurses about\ntheir experiences in providing HIV treatment for\nchildren, including barriers and facilitators, as well\nas their interaction with treatment partners. With\npermission, the interviews were digitally recorded,\ntranscribed and translated into English by the field-\nworkers. To ensure the accuracy of transcription and\ntranslation, 20% of all transcripts were randomly\nselected to undergo a quality check, including back-\ntranslation. No inaccuracies were identified. Indivi-\ndual and group interview transcripts of both nurses\nand elderly guardians were imported into the quali-\ntative software package Atlas.Ti for thematic content\nanalysis (Flick, 2002). Data collected by the two study\nmethods and populations were pooled and analysed\ncollectively to provide a holistic and comprehensive\nunderstanding of patterns (core themes) within the\ndata corpus (Braun & Clarke, 2006). Using a social\nconstructionist perspective, we sought to map out\nfeatures of the collectively constructed representa-\ntional field which shaped both nurses\u2019 and carers\u2019\nunderstandings and actions, rather than seeking to\ndocument attitudes conceived of as properties of\nindividuals (Gaskell, 2001). Following the steps of\nAttride-Stirling\u2019s (2001) thematic network analysis,\ntext segments were first coded with an interpretative\ntitle, which were clustered into higher order, or\nprimary themes. The outcome of this thematic net-\nwork analysis is presented in Figure 1, which high-\nlights the three primary themes that address the\nresearch question of this paper and make up the\nstructure of our presentation of findings.\nFindings\nTo contextualise our findings within the lived realities\nof the elderly guardians acting as treatment partners,\nTable 1 gives detail to the household composition of\neach of the eight guardians participating in this study.\nWhat Table 1 encapsulates is the impact of AIDS on\nfamilies and the fostering role of older people. Several\nguardians had lost their husbands and children and\nwere now the foster parents of their grandchildren,\nyoung nieces or nephews. As such, the table also\nhighlights that elderly people were not necessarily\nalone in creating a supportive context for children on\nART; there were often other children in the house-\nhold who could help out. The HIV-positive children\non ART in the eight households described in Table 1\nwere all on first-line treatment (combination of\nStavudine, Lamivudine and Nevirapine), which was\nadministered on a weight-based system in tablets.\nAlthough syrups, which are more easily administered\nto younger children, are available, these are hard to\naccess in Zimbabwe.\nOverall, great progress has been made in achiev-\ning children\u2019s access and adherence to ART in this\ncontext, however, as we will now illustrate, HIV-\ninfected children who live with their elderly guardians\nmay face some barriers to optimal ARV adherence\nthat are unique to their care arrangements.\nPoverty and struggles\nHouseholds made up of elderly guardians and\norphaned or AIDS-affected children are particularly\nvulnerable to poverty and related struggles. One such\nexample includes the struggles faced by Joanna who is\ntoo old to work and has difficulties paying for the\nschooling and clothing of her foster children.\nThe problems I am facing are monetary including\nschooling and clothing. All these are solely my\nresponsibility at the same time I am too old to work\nFigure 1. Thematic network: challenges (lessened by chil-\ndren\u2019s agency, see dotted boxes) faced by elderly guardians\nin sustaining the ART adherence of HIV-infected children.\nAIDS Care 959\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [L\nSE\n L\nibr\nary\n] a\nt 0\n4:5\n2 2\n4 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n2 \nand this has been a major problem. (Joanna (52),\nelderly guardian)\nSuch struggles often result in children having to carry\nthe responsibility of contributing to household suste-\nnance, and on occasion HIV-infected and ill children\nare forced to engage inwork.As one nurse commented:\nThere are those who want to take advantage of these\nchildren. Maybe the child will be the only grandchild\nbut he sends him to the grinding mill, to fetch water,\nto water the garden some being used that you feel\npity. There was a case of a sick child, the grand-\nmother was saying a-aah she works she even goes to\nfetch firewood. That child died. (Peter (35), nurse)\nIn response to the poverty and struggles faced\nby ARV users in this context, a number of non-\ngovernmental organisations were reported to provide\nthem with food aid, minimising pressures on sick\nchildren to engage in income and food generating\nwork as well as providing them with a nutritious diet\nto support their treatment.\nSome of these children are being cared for by elderly\nguardians so they lack food but now that problem\nhas been met because a lot of organizations are\ndistributing food in the area. (Jackie (36), nurse)\nImmobility\nWe have already alluded to the fact that some elderly\nguardians are unable to generate food and income.\nBut in what other ways can their immobility com-\npromise children\u2019s adherence to ART? ARV users in\nthis context need to go for check-ups and pick up\ntheir drugs at a designated health facility on a\nmonthly basis. Each visit costs US$1, covering the\nadministrative costs of the check-up, which, coupled\nwith potential transport costs, can be a challenge for\nelderly people to pay. But the immobility of some\nelderly guardians can also prevent them from accom-\npanying their children to their monthly review dates.\nThis is particularly the case with young children who\nneed to be carried.\nLike me at my age, to think of going there on foot or\neven to carry the child on my back, it\u2019s impossible\nand for me to get someone to help me take the child\nto hospital can be impossible. I can\u2019t even think of\ncarrying a child on my back at my age, if I fail to get\nanyone who is kind enough to help me then there is\nlittle I can do. (Cellestine (54), elderly guardian)\nOther times the sheer distance can present as a barrier\nfor guardians who had difficulties walking. They were\nalso more likely to get sick and be periodically\nimmobile, preventing the child from attending its\nreview date and pick up ARV supplies.\nTable 1. Household characteristics of elderly guardians\nproviding HIV care for children.\nElderly guardian Household characteristics\nNokutenda, age\n79\nNokutenda stays with five\ngrandchildren between the ages 4\u000112,\nof which one 8-year-old girl is HIV-\npositive and on ART.

(James (36), nurse)\nElderly women, they would be coming from far away.\nFor her to send the child by herself is not possible, for\nher to send someone with the child is difficult because\nof the issue of stigma, so they will remain at\nhome and miss the appointment. If there was a\nmobile facility that would have helped. (Roselyn (57),\nnurse)\nHowever, carers repeatedly stated the strength of\ntheir commitment to ensure that children attended\ntheir monthly hospital review on the appropriate\ndate.\nThe only thing that can stop me would be if I fall ill\nmyself, and I fail to find anyone to escort my child to\nthe hospital, As for my chores at home, I will always\nleave them behind and take the child to hospital first.\n(Nokutenda (79), elderly guardian)\nPoor memory and comprehension\nFor some elderly guardians, remembering the review\ndates was a bigger challenge than immobility. Several\ninformants spoke of difficulties faced by elderly\nguardians in remembering drug review dates, often\nonly returning to the hospital when drugs had run\nout, resulting in a delay in the child\u2019s treatment.\nSometimes these children will be staying with their\ngrandmothers and these grandmothers are old, so\nthey may sometimes forget the review dates, when\nthey are and how many weeks they should wait\nbefore going back, so they end up forgetting every-\nthing, hence they delay to go and get the children\u2019s\npills. (Marjorie (53), elderly guardian)\nForgetfulness can also mean that children are not\nreminded to take their drugs at a regular interval,\nwith elderly guardians forgetting when the last drug\nwas taken. This, coupled with a relative complicated\nadministration of drugs, may compromise the child\u2019s\ntreatment.\nSome of them stay with grandparents who are too\nold, and who confuse the time or the drugs the child\nhas to take. (Evelyn (29), nurse)\nHowever, occasionally other household members,\nand children in particular, play an active role in\nhelping their elderly guardians remember when drugs\nneed to be taken.\nThe other children are the ones who are reminding\nme, they remind him to take the tablets and they also\ntell me that he has taken the tablets and is now leaving\nfor school. (Nokutenda (79), elderly guardian)\nNo I do not forget to give the child the drugs. Even if\nI was to forget this kid himself would remind me.\nYou hear him saying: \u2018\u2018Granny its six o\u2019clock, time\nfor my medication\u2019\u2019. (Violet (67), elderly guardian)\nA number of nurses spoke of problems in commu-\nnicating with elderly guardians. They said the guar-\ndians often failed to understand the complexity of the\nchild\u2019s treatment regimen.Nurses go to great lengths to\nensure that treatment partners \u0001 who play a primary\nrole in facilitating the treatment regimen of ARV\nusers \u0001 have the tools and knowledge to facilitate child\nadherence, but these are often inadequate for elderly\npeople who are unable to read and write. This is\nparticularly a problem if the child in their care is still\nyoung and cannot assist in keeping notes for their\ntreatment schedule.\nMost of the children we have who are on ART are\ncared for by people who are very old. We give people\nadherence calendars that they should fill in, but what if\nshe can\u2019t write, if she is 80 something years? The child\nmay be around four or six years, so for her to write\ndown and to properly administer the drugs may be\nchallenging. She doesn\u2019t even know the name of\nthe drug she is giving the child. You would have told\nher the namebut shewon\u2019t remember it, she just knows\nthat the child is onmedication, that\u2019s very tricky. Some\nof them they do not have middle aged people close to\nthem to help them with taking care of the child, so its\nreally a challenge. (Collin (27), nurse)\nAs Miriam, a nurse, explains, many of the elderly\nguardians are aware of their limitations and actively\nremind the child to be alert to the advice they receive\nfrom the nurses.\nIt\u2019s a challenge when you have to explain to an elderly\nperson, especially the issue of food, I would be\nemphasizing what the child needs to eat, I will explain\nit to the childandIwill do it thoroughly so that thechild\nwill remind the grandmother. The grandmother will\nactually call the child to be alert to what we will be\nsaying, you realize that the child is now taking\nresponsibility for all this yet it should be the other way\nround. When it comes to food, you will hear that the\nchildhaseatenonlyonce,yet s\/heshouldbeeatingmore\noften than this for the drugs, so it\u2019s a challenge, there is\na problem with elderly caregivers. (Judith (34), nurse)\nDiscussion\nThe findings presented in this paper first and fore-\nmost highlight the commitment and dedication\nelderly people show in ensuring that children under\ntheir care comply with the rigid treatment regimens\nassociated with ART, an asset previously identified\nAIDS Care 961\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [L\nSE\n L\nibr\nary\n] a\nt 0\n4:5\n2 2\n4 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n2 \nin Cambodia (Williams, Knodel, Kim, Puch, &\nSaengtienchai, 2008) and Thailand (Knodel, Kespi\nchayawattana, Saengtienchai, & Wiwathwanich,\n2009). In this paper we have illustrated that dete-\nriorating mobility, memory and comprehension of\ncomplicated treatment plans, coupled with poverty\nin a context of limited social welfare and government\nsupport, make it difficult for some elderly guardians\nto sustain the treatment of HIV-infected children in\ntheir care \u0001 presenting a key challenge for paediatric\nART adherence. Our findings suggest that support\nfor elderly carers should address both their poverty-\nand age-related needs. Although these needs are\ninterrelated, they require different interventions.\nAge-related challenges refer to their physical limita-\ntions (deteriorating memory, comprehension and\nmobility) and poverty-related challenges refer to\ntheir lack of income and food, necessitating the\ninfected child to engage in income generating\nactivities beyond what is good for them. Whilst the\nobstacles faced by elderly guardians took precedence\nin this paper, our informants did also highlight\npotential strategies that can help elderly people in\ntheir role as treatment partners of HIV-infected\nchildren. These included the distribution of food\naid, encouraging children\u2019s agency and participation\nin the treatment, stigma-reduction programmes,\nincreasing social support networks, mobile health\nfacilities and improving the physical access to health\nfacilities (e.g., constructing satellite clinics to reduce\nthe distance).\nIt is clear that elderly people are ideally positioned\nas treatment partners to HIV-infected children by\nvirtue of their living arrangements and associated\nemotional attachments (Knodel et al., 2009). How-\never, as some of the age-related challenges identified\nin this paper highlight, such arrangements could\nbenefit from externally facilitated support. HelpAge\nInternational (2008) recommend that elderly carers,\nespecially women, must have access to legal advice,\nfinancial support and literacy programmes, so that\nthey can access entitlements for themselves and those\nin their care. Failure to address the rights of elderly\npeople will undermine their ability to care for others.\nOne way to address poverty-related challenges is to\nmake financial support, such as social pensions,\navailable. Social pensions targeting poor and vulner-\nable elderly people have been identified as a feasible\nintervention alleviating the impact of HIV and AIDS\n(Kakwani & Subbarao, 2007; Schatz & Ogunmefun,\n2007). These pensions, in the form of monthly cash\ntransfers to elderly people, could enable already\ncommitted elderly guardians to use the funds on\ndirect and indirect expenses related to the treatment\nof children under their care (such as drugs or hospital\nfees, transport and food). Child-support grants, as\nseen in South Africa (Case, Hosegood, & Lund, 2005)\nand Kenya (Bryant, 2009) also have the potential to\nalleviate some of the poverty-related challenges\nidentified in this paper as barriers to the adherence\nof ART in children.\nIn addition to cash transfers, social networks can\nbe strengthened through community mobilisation and\ncommunity health workers (or hospital outreach\nstaff) to monitor and address the challenges specific\nto households with elderly guardians (Skovdal,\nMwasiaji, Webale, & Tomkins, 2008; Skovdal, Mwa-\nsiaji, Webale, & Tomkins, 2010). Such services could\nencompass providing elderly people with locally\nappropriate mobility aids and alarmed watches to\nensure timely follow-ups and medication as well as\nmaking information about treatment regimens acces-\nsible to elderly people. One of our informants also\nhighlighted the need for mobile health services,\nsuggesting the need to decentralise ART dispensing\nto local clinics as well as making outreach staff\nmobile so that they can reach immobile elderly\nguardians out in the communities.\nThis study also highlighted that in contexts of\nlimited support, the agentic capabilities of older\nchildren (over the age of 10 as defined by Ferrand\net al., 2010) play a key role in coping with some of\nthe challenges identified in this paper. Older children\nhelp with income and food generating activities and\nremind guardians about review dates and the admin-\nistration of drugs. Therefore, to ensure the adherence\nto ART in children under the care of elderly guardian,\nthere is an urgent need for HIV services to embrace\nand involve both the children and their elderly\nguardians in HIV programme planning. Older chil-\ndren living in the household, whether HIV-positive\nthemselves or the older siblings of a younger-positive\nchild, need to be acknowledged as contributing agents\nto ART adherence. Not only will such an acknowl-\nedgement of children\u2019s agency help us move beyond\nunhelpful understandings of children as a \u2018\u2018burden\u2019\u2019 to\n\u2018\u2018burdened\u2019\u2019 elderly people, it also highlights the\nimportance of involving older children in the treat-\nment process.\nTo conclude, we believe that much more needs to\nbe done to advocate for policies and programmes that\ntake heed of some of the challenges and resources\nidentified in this paper and argue for more family\/\nhousehold centred HIV services that take account of\nthe elderlies\u2019 needs for support, and acknowledge and\nenhance the agency of older children as active and\nresponsible contributors to ART adherence.
