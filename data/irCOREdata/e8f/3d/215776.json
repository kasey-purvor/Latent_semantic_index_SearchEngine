These have \nmobilised poor people to demand access to land, health services and life-\nsaving medical treatment respectively. We show how each group has \nsucceeded not only through (i) building the \u2018voice\u2019 of the poor to make forceful \ndemands, but also through (ii) facilitating the development of  \u2018receptive social \nenvironments\u2019 in which the rich are willing to take these voices seriously. \nCommunity psychologists need to pay more attention to the latter challenge.  \n \nKeywords: social movements, Landless Worker\u2019s Movement, People\u2019s \nHealth Movement, Treatment Action Campaign, community psychology. \n \n This paper examines the processes through which social movements succeed \nin empowering poor people and facilitating social change. Mass movements, \nsuch as the feminist movement in the west, and anti-colonial movements in \ncountries such as India, have long been linked to positive social outcomes. \nWith globalisation creating new forms of poverty and inequalities, and the \nfailure of \u2018traditional\u2019 forms of political struggle and development to change \nthese (Hoogvelt, 2001), there is currently a renewed interest in the potential of \nsocial movements as a means of challenging inequalities. \n \nEscobar (1992; 1995) argues that social movements are of interest because \nthey offer an alternative form of development and politics to \u2018conventional\u2019 or \nmainstream non-governmental organisations (NGOs) whether local or \ninternational. He argues that many of the disappointing outcomes of \nmainstream development approaches are the result of the \u2018depoliticisation\u2019 of \npoverty by NGOs and other organisations such as the World Bank and \nbilateral donors, with their focus on technical solutions. These include \nmeasures such as income generation projects, pro-poor economic policies or \nwelfare grants that fail to challenge the wider local, national and global \ninequalities that undermine the ability of poor people to improve their life \nchances (Ferguson, 1994).  \n \nSocial movements are argued to open up new possibilities for social change \ninsofar as they \u201c\u2026 tend to bypass established development organisations, \nlocal elites and parties, or engage them on different terms. But they are by no \nmeans apolitical; instead of a depoliticized development, they politicise the \nrights of the poor.\u201d (Escobar, 1992, p. 422). They do not aim to gain state \npower, rather they seek to re-shape power relations within the state, and more \nwidely. Furthermore they are rooted in local struggles, generally spearheaded \nby the marginalised. Overall, social movements offer an alternative vision of \nthe struggle for development and poverty reduction compared to mainstream \nNGOs, one that is politicised, emerging from those who are marginalised, and \nenable poor people to engage in efforts to turn this vision into action. \n \nSOCIAL MOVEMENTS AND COMMUNITY PSYCHOLOGY \n \nPsychology, and particularly community psychology stand to gain significantly \nfrom greater attention to people\u2019s participation in successful large-scale social \nmovements. The little attention that has been given to social movements in \nPsychology has focused on social psychological questions concerning why \nindividuals do or do not affiliate themselves with particular social movements \n(e.g. Klandermans, 1997), or on community psychological concerns regarding \nprocesses of participation. Neither the social psychology of collective action \nnor community psychology have given much attention to the processes \nthrough which social movements have an impact in society, or how social \nmovements create an environment in which the demands of marginalised \npeople are heard and acted upon.   \n \nIt is in relation to the community psychology literature on collective action that \nwe particularly locate our contribution in this paper. In principle, community \npsychology is strongly committed to understanding the role that collective \naction can play in facilitating the empowerment of the poor through \nchallenging large scale power relations (Seedat, 2001; Nelson & Prilleltensky, \n2006). In practice, however, community psychologists tend to engage in \nanalysis and action at the level of small-group activism and empowerment. \nThey tend to work on small-scale bottom-up projects, usually involving \nnarrowly defined excluded groups (Orford, 2008). Whilst their efforts may \nimprove the lives of project participants in small-scale ways, they seldom \nresult in significant sustainable or generalisable social change. In final project \nwrite-ups, wider social hierarchies  (based on factors such as gender or socio-\neconomic status) are most often depicted as obstacles to long-term project \nsustainability and to the \u2018scale-up\u2019 of innovative project strategies to other \nsimilar communities. Such final reports often conclude that such power \nhierarchies are too entrenched for small-scale groups of marginalised people \nto mount an effective and sustainable fight against their ill-effects (Campbell & \nCornish, 2010). \n \nIn the terminology that we seek to develop in this paper, such projects are \noften successful in building the \u2018voice\u2019 of the poor, but less successful in \nbuilding \u2018receptive social environments\u2019. \u2018Voice\u2019 includes poor people\u2019s \ncapacity both to develop critical analyses which link their poverty to wider \nsocial inequalities and also to articulate forceful demands on the basis of \nthese critical understandings. Projects develop voice through providing \n\u2018transformative social spaces\u2019 for dialogue (Campbell & Scott, 2009) in which \npoor people are able to engage in \u2018critical thinking\u2019 about the social roots of \nwhat might previously have been regarded as individual problems (we use the \nterm critical thinking to refer to Freire\u2019s \u2018conscientisation\u2019, 1973). This builds \ntheir sense of empowerment, and their confidence to challenge the negative \nsocial relations that place their well-being at risk (Gaventa & Cornwall, 2001).  \n \nSuch projects are often less successful in creating \u2018receptive social \nenvironments\u2019 in which the powerful are willing to listen to the voices of the \npoor and take them seriously \u2013 which would be a precondition for sustainable \nand generalisable change (Campbell & Cornish, 2010). Projects often assume \nthat poor people themselves will be able to capture the attention of the \npowerful once they have been empowered (Jones, 2001). Yet this is often not \nthe case. Community psychologists still have much to learn about how best to \nsupplement their careful and creative \u2018bottom-up\u2019 work with marginalised \ncommunities with appropriate parallel efforts to create receptive social \nenvironments in which powerful social actors are willing to heed the demands \nof the marginalised. \n \nAgainst this background, successful social movements are of particular \ninterest because they are driven by similar aims and strategies to those of \nsmall-scale community psychology projects seeking to build the confidence \nand capacity of the poor. They implement them on a much wider and more \nambitious scale, however. Furthermore, compared to many more traditional \ncommunity empowerment projects, social movements are more ambitious in \nrelation to the level at which they seek to challenge the power hierarchies that \noppress the poor. Social movements seek not only to build the voice of the \npoor to make forceful and articulate demands, but also to create social \nsettings in which powerful people \u2013 locally, nationally and globally \u2013 are open \nto hearing what the poor have to say and to supporting them in achieving the \nmovement\u2019s goals. \n \nIn this paper we explore three different social movements, each of which, we \nwill argue, has succeeded through not only building the voice of the poor, but \nalso creating receptive environments in which the rich are willing to take these \nvoices seriously. Movimento Dos Trabalhadores Rurais Sem Terra (MST), \nknown in English as the Landless Workers\u2019 Movement, in Brazil, has one \nmillion members. The movement has mobilised some of Brazil\u2019s most \nmarginalised and dispossessed inhabitants to successfully demand the \nredistribution of land from the rich to the poor. Jan Swasthya Abhiyan (JSA), \nan Indian wing of the global People\u2019s Health Movement (PHM), has, through \nits constituent organizations, successfully organised over a million poor \npeople to demand better health services from government, and played a key \nrole in wider social movements to put primary health care back on the global \npublic health agenda. Finally the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC) has \nchannelled the voice of one of South Africa\u2019s most marginalised groups \u2013 \nyoung, black, unemployed, HIV positive women \u2013 into a movement that has \nsuccessfully challenged their highly resistant government to provided free \nuniversal access to otherwise unaffordable life-saving anti-retroviral therapy \n(ART).  \n \nThese three social movements address issues that are wider than economic \npoverty per se, but all of which are urgent concerns for people living in \npoverty. Sen (1999) criticises definitions of poverty that focus narrowly on \npeople\u2019s access to material resources \u2013 such as money or services or land. \nHe argues that poverty should also be defined in terms of other human \n\u2018capabilities\u2019 that are equally important prerequisites for \u2018human freedom\u2019. \nHigh in his list of the \u2018capabilities\u2019 denied to the poor is the ability to make \neffective political demands \u2013 around issues such as health and education. \nHowever, drawing on the work of Bourdieu (1986), Nair and Campbell (2008) \nemphasise that poor people are seldom able to bring about effective social \nchange without the support of actors and agencies holding the political and \neconomic power that is necessary for the poor to achieve their goals. Spivak \n(1988) refers to the vital role such \u2018strategic alliances\u2019 need to play if \nmarginalised groups are to be heard and to flourish. \n \nIn this paper we examine how these three social movements have succeeded \nin creating environments that have enabled the development of political \ncapabilities amongst groups of poor people in Brazil, India and South Africa \u2013 \nthrough mobilising significant political and economic actors to heed their \ndemands, and to take them seriously. These movements have built the \npolitical capacities of the poor to make a key contribution to the struggles for \nthe redistribution of land, improvements in the quality of essential health \nservices and the distribution of life-saving and expensive drugs respectively. \nHow have these movements served to build \u2018receptive social environments\u2019 in \nwhich poor people\u2019s capabilities are most likely to flourish through being heard \nand taken seriously? \n \nTHREE CASE STUDIES \n \nWe discuss our three case studies in the light of our review of the published \nacademic literature on each one. However one co-author has participated in \nan internship with one of JSA\u2019s leading constituent NGOs and another has \nworked as a volunteer for the TAC in South Africa. These experiences will \ninevitably have informed our accounts of these two social movements. We \npresent our discussion of each case study around four themes in turn: the \naims and achievements of the group; strategies for building the voice of its \nmembers; strategies for building receptive social environments; and key \nchallenges faced by the movement. \n \nMOVIMENTO DOS TRABALHADORES RURAIS SEM TERRA (MST) \n \nIn Brazil, 70% of agricultural land is owned by 3% of the people. Since 1984, \nBrazil\u2019s Landless Workers' Movement (MST) has fought for agrarian reform \nand a more just society. It pressurizes the government to redistribute idle \nfarmland to landless workers, reverse land concentration, and reallocate state \nresources to benefit small cooperative farms. It draws its legal argument from \nthe Brazilian constitution\u2019s statement that \u201cland has a social responsibility to \nbe productive\u201d, arguing that it should thus be redistributed from landowners \nwho are not using it to landless people willing to work it (Walford, 2003, p. \n506).   \n \nMST has over a million members. It has organized over 230,000 land \noccupations, winning 15-million acres for land reform, creating 1,500 \nagricultural communities, and settling over 250,000 families. It has established \nschools and clinics on occupied land to serve workers\u2019 families, running over \n1,200 schools, and educating approximately 150,000 children, as well as \n25,000 adults in literacy courses (Brandford & Rocha, 2002). Schools draw on \nFreire\u2019s (1973) advocacy of dialogue over didactics and his critical questioning \nof social injustice.  \n \nMost MST occupations take place on unoccupied land legally defined as \nunproductive. However, several occupations have taken place on land owned \nand used by large corporations or landowners, such as the March 2002 \noccupation of then President Cardoso\u2019s family farm (Walford, 2005).  \n \nMST\u2019s activism has also included roadblocks and long distance mass \nmarches to government ministries. In 2005, 12,000 landless peasants \nmarched 200 kilometres to Brazil\u2019s capital demanding speedier action on \nPresident Lula da Silva\u2019s land reform promises (Kingston, 2005). MST leaders \nreadily meet government ministers and actively seek media attention to \npublicize their demands (Hammond, 2004).  \n \nMST: Building Strong Voice \n MST\u2019s success has depended on its ability to unite the geographically isolated \nand economically marginalized rural poor and offer a strong organizational \nframework and coherent action strategy for change. This has been at the \nmovement\u2019s heart since its inception in 1983, when two Catholic land groups \nhosted a national conference of land reform activists and agreed to form one \nnational organisation \u2013 MST. Occupations had been part of Brazil\u2019s political \nlandscape since the first successful one in 1979, orchestrated by Joao Pedro \nStedile, using the constitution to formalise it. Thereafter, local autonomous \nstruggles mushroomed throughout Brazil without any leadership. MST united \nthese groups.  \n \nMST develops strong \u2018voice\u2019 through promoting critical thinking among \nmembers. When inviting landless poor to take part in occupations or \ndemonstrations, it builds momentum through consciousness raising meetings \nover several months. Leaders talk about the injustices of Brazilian society, \nintroducing land occupation as part of a potential solution (Welch, 2006). \nIdeally new members come to see how economic, social and political \nstructures limit their life chances, seeing collective action as a strategy for \nchallenging the system. Rather than focusing energies on individual legal \nbattles, the movement gains momentum from its conceptualisation of landless \nand small-scale farmers as engaging in class struggle with those who stole \nland from society as a whole \u2013 the large landowners, bankers, politicians and \ncorporations. \n \nDespite the movement\u2019s commitment to constructing a sense of united \npolitical purpose, in reality, some members are motivated by their need to \ngain land rather than to build a more just society (Caldeira, 2008). At this \nadvanced stage, most of MST\u2019s members are no longer landless, opening the \nrisk that it might become a victim of its own success. Newly landed workers \nhave continued to play a central role in the movement, however, using their \nimproved circumstances to donate resources and to express solidarity with \ncontinuing struggles. This continuity is generated through linking MST \nmembership not just with land, but also with a strong rural identity and sense \nof community. Coordinators communicate with membership through meetings, \na movement run newspaper and magazine, and numerous pamphlets (Issa, \n2007). \n \nMST: Building a receptive social environment \n \nMST gained recognition in the Brazilian public sphere through favourable \nmedia coverage emphasising peaceful activism, and the legality, economic \nlogic, and moral correctness of its actions. Mass marches in cities gained it \nthe support of urban groups and elites. It also reached the \u201cthe pinnacle of \nrecognition by Brazilian popular culture\u201d by being given favourable exposure \nin a popular national telenovela (Hammond, 2004, p. 81) \n \nMST has worked hard to emphasise its legal correctness, sometimes using \nthe existing legal system to gain additional land, rather than land occupations. \nIt has also used the Brazilian constitution to formalise rights to occupied land. \nFurthermore, the common-sense economic argument that unused land ought \nto be used to increase food production and stem urban migration has \nappealed even to those with little ideological solidarity with the rural landless. \nThe violent oppression faced by the landless activists, especially the widely \npublicised murder of 19 activists by police in 1996 generated much sympathy, \npositioning the movement firmly on the moral high ground (Hammond, 1999).  \n \nThere is still some resistance to MST, however, particularly from wealthy \nlandholders, urban elites and mainstream media, some of whom have \nbranded occupiers as \u2018unemployed vagabonds\u2019 or dangerous radicals, even \nsince the election of the leftist PT government in 2003 (Karriem 2008; \nWalford, 2005). Nevertheless, MST remains a popular organisation regarded \nas a credible and authoritative voice on land issues. A Brazil-wide poll in 1997 \nfound 52% had a positive view of MST, with 85% approving of occupations \nprovided they were non-violent (SEJUP 1997). Another poll ranked them the \nfifth most esteemed institution in Brazil (Welch, 2006).  \n \nMST\u2019s successes can be partially understood within the wider context of \nBrazilian activism, especially the \u2018liberation theology\u2019 preached by the Catholic \nChurch\u2019s radical wing in the 1960s and 70s \u2013 a religious world view \nencouraging activism among the poor. As MST\u2019s founder put it: \u201cBefore, the \nline had been: 'No need to worry, you'll have your land in heaven.' Now it was: \n'Since you've already got land in heaven, let's struggle for it here as well.'\u201d \n(Stedile, 2002, p. 79).  \n \nSupport from other Brazilian grassroots movements, the Catholic Church, \nunions and international organisations have further strengthened MST. It has \ndeveloped a close relationship with the Brazilian Homeless Workers \nMovement, an urban version of MST, consolidating urban support (Duffy, \n2007). Trade unions and churches have helped MST with training courses \nand funding. \n \nMST has received formal and informal international support. Financial support \nfrom America and Europe is channelled into training for activists (Stedile, \n2002). The US-based \u2018Friends of MST\u2019 is a network of individuals and \norganisations promoting solidarity for the movement in the English-speaking \nworld, particularly through promoting positive representations of MST in the \nglobal media, running educational events and activities that aim to raise the \ninternational profile of MST, and organizing strategically targeted actions in \nthe US (such as marches, demonstrations and \u201caction alert\u201d emails) that \nrespond to issue-specific requests from the MST\u2019s headquarters (Quirk 2007). \n \nThe MST\u2019s horizontal and collective structure emphasizes the equality of all \nmembers (Vanden, 2005).  Neighbourhood groups form the base units of \nMST. Each neighbourhood group sends two representatives to the ruling \ncouncil of its co-operative, settlement or temporary encampment. Each ruling \ncouncil sends representatives to regional and state congresses. Every two \nyears there is a National Encounter, and every five years a National \nCongress, to which ruling councils send representatives. Furthermore the \nNational Coordinating Council is made up of 102 representatives, illustrating \nhow, even at national meetings, leadership is shared among many members, \nenabling the voices of marginalised workers to be channelled to the national \nlevel (Vanden, 2005). \n \nMST: Challenges  \n \nA significant and on-going ideological conflict exists between the more affluent \nand educated leaders, and the rank and file member base. Leaders support a \nvision of rural communal life characterized by peace and communitarianism, \nwhile workers point out that historically Brazilian rural life has been \ncharacterised by exploitation on plantations, actively resisting this idyllic \n\u2018mythologizing\u2019 of rural life (Caldeira 2008). Despite differences of this nature, \nhowever, MST leaders and members have managed to work together \nsuccessfully to achieve the organisation\u2019s victories: settlers have gained land \nand leaders have sustained political and legal debate on Brazilian agrarian \nreform. \n \nTHE PEOPLE\u2019S HEALTH MOVEMENT: INDIA\u2019S JAN SWASTHYA \nABHIYAN (JSA)  \n \nThe PHM is an international network of organisations seeking to place primary \nhealthcare back on the international health agenda and challenge the impact \nof neo-liberal policies on health and development since the mid-1970s. PHM \noperates as a loose network, with individual organisations signing up to its \nbroader objectives, but operating autonomously. There is on-going \ncommunication between different member groups for support and knowledge \nsharing (Turiano & Smith, 2008).  \n \nOne particularly prominent member of PHM is the Indian Jan Swasthya \nAbhiyan (JSA), meaning \u2018people\u2019s health movement\u2019 in Hindi. JSA is \nparticularly active in advancing the comprehensive primary healthcare agenda \nin India. Along with PHM, JSA supports a \u2018social determinants\u2019 approach \nemphasising how poverty, privatization and gender inequality undermine \nhealth. They support various struggles for workers\u2019 rights, environmental \nsustainability, gender equity, indigenous rights, food security and education. \nResisting technical understandings of health in terms of disease, they \nemphasise the role of capitalism and globalization in worsening health \ninequalities. Indian member organisations join the JSA by endorsing the \nIndian People\u2019s Charter for Health, rooted in similar anti-globalization, pro-\npeople, primary healthcare tenets as the PHM Charter.  \n \nRather than a unitary organisation, JSA is a national coalition of NGOs, \npeople\u2019s organisations, activists, health professionals and academics, all \nworking towards the goal of \u2018Health for All\u2019 (Ahmad, 2004), via universally \naccessible, accountable, high quality public healthcare incorporating \nmeaningful community participation in health services (Gwatkin, Bhuiya, & \nVictora, 2004).  JSA has harnessed the energy of Indian health organizations \nto launch well-publicized campaigns leading to significant improvements in the \nIndian healthcare system. Since its inception in 2000, JSA has organised or \nsupported over 15 nationally coordinated initiatives, including the Right to \nFood Campaign, Rural Health Watch, Hunger Watch, and a campaign against \nthe practice of sex selective abortion.  \n \nJSA\u2019s most significant achievement has been its role in shaping and \nmonitoring the Indian government\u2019s National Rural Health Mission (NRHM). \nThis included lobbying to reduce the allegedly pro-privatisation slant of the \nNRHM, creating spaces for community monitoring of the programme and \nsetting up a parallel independent monitoring system called People\u2019s Rural \nHealth Watch to enable those receiving care through the NRHM to monitor \nthe mission\u2019s failings and demand improved services.  Another success has \nbeen JSA\u2019s Right To Health Care campaign, where, with large political \nsupport, it has set up tribunals enabling poor people to express their \ndiscontent with local primary healthcare services to central government.  \n \nJSA: Building Voice \nJSA developed out of India\u2019s first National Health Assembly (NHA) in Kolkata \nin December 2000. The NHA united 2000 Indian health activists who were \nfrustrated at government failure to make significant progress towards Health \nfor all by 2000, the WHO campaign adopted by all WHO member countries in \nthe 1978 Alma Ata Declaration (Beaglehole,  Bonita, Horton,  Adams & \nMcKee, 2004). The NHA aimed to stop the Indian government from forgetting \nits pledge, and to enable civil society actors to play a stronger, more \ncoordinated role in pushing for health for all (Richards, 2005). By joining JSA, \nsmall and medium sized groups across India working on local issues could \namplify their message, increasing their access to media, expert advice, and \ngovernment attention.  \n \nJSA: Building Receptive Social Environments \n \nJSA has become the primary voice for health issues in India, gaining \nlegitimacy through its representation of a large group of activists, including \npolitically prominent members and well known doctors and academics. Its \nrepresentation of so many respected organisations has forced the \ngovernment and media to take its campaigns seriously. In May 2009 when \nJSA released its Health Manifesto, and invited political parties in the \nforthcoming national elections to respond to it, it received widespread media \ncoverage. \n \nJSA has also been supported by the wider PHM. The success of PHM\u2019s \npublication Global Health Watch 2 \u2013 which was supported by many influential \ninternational organisations, including the Lancet \u2013 has helped create a \nbroader symbolic context which is increasingly receptive to claims around \nprimary healthcare.  \n \nJSA has succeeded in building strong support for project goals within small \nlocal communities, and building effective bridges between health rights \nactivists and powerful external agents. It has forged productive alliances \nbetween middle-class or well connected activists and poor people fighting for \nsocial justice through People\u2019s Organisations (POs) and community-based \norganisations (CBO\u2019s) to create strong support. \n \nJSA has used its middle class support base to access government and media \nattention, using these channels to funnel the voices of the poor to the heart of \ngovernment policy-making. These contacts ensured vital support for the 2003 \nRight to Health Care Campaign (RTHC) by India\u2019s National Human Rights \nCommission (NHRC), for example. Such contacts also served to facilitate the \nCampaign\u2019s extraordinary success in communicating firsthand accounts of \nordinary peoples\u2019 negative experiences of healthcare facilities to influential \ngovernment policy makers. The JSA, with NHRC\u2019s support, asked local \nmember organizations to run People\u2019s Health Tribunals across the country \nwhere community members were able to express their personal experiences \nwith the systemic failures of the Indian healthcare system (Labonte, 2005; \nShukla, 2005).  \n \nUsing these findings, JSA convinced the government to hold a National Public \nHearing on the Right to Health Care in 2004. India\u2019s top health ministers and \nofficials attended. Over 100 JSA representatives from 22 states testified to the \ndepth, scale and range of health violations occurring in the public healthcare \nsystem (Turiano & Smith, 2008). Rural people were able to tell stories of their \nill-treatment and neglect to some of the country\u2019s most powerful government \nhealth ministers. \n \nJSA used its experience with the RTHC and the tribunal process to channel \nvoices of the poor into government policy making. In 2005, the PHM picked up \non this, launching the international Right to Health and Health Care Campaign  \ndrawing on the JSA\u2019s experiences. This international campaign encouraged \nother PHM members to use JSA techniques to push for improved primary \nhealthcare (Labonte, 2005; PHM, 2007). In this way, the PHM network \nenabled JSA to extend the scope and scale of their successful strategies from \nIndia to many other countries. \n \nJSA: Challenges \n \nJSA has on-going debates about how closely to work with government. For \nexample, the government Nation Rural Health Movement (NRHM) promoted \nmany of JSA\u2019s aims including a primary health focus in public health, \ncommunity health workers, community participation in health service \nmonitoring, and health as basic right. Some are willing to work with the \ngovernment, others fear such involvement compromises JSA\u2019s critical stance. \nThese conflicts have been at least temporarily overcome by enabling different \nmembers of JSA to choose different paths of involvement.  \n \nTHE TREATMENT ACTION CAMPAIGN (TAC) \n \nThe Treatment Action Campaign (TAC) has been described as the most \nsuccessful social movement in post-apartheid South Africa. Where other \nsocial movements have failed to substantially change government policy, TAC \nhas been at the forefront of shaping the government\u2019s HIV\/AIDS policy \n(Ballard, Habib & Valodia, 2006).  \n \nFounded in 1998, the TAC aimed to push the African National Congress \n(ANC) government to provide universal access to ART through the public \nhealth system. It has also been involved in challenging former President \nMbeki\u2019s and former Health Minister Tshabalala-Msimang\u2019s views that there is \nno relationship between HIV and AIDS, and their denial of the efficacy of ART.  \n \nTAC\u2019s membership is around 8,000, but it can mobilise many thousands more \nwhen necessary. TAC\u2019s membership is primarily urban young black \nunemployed women, although it also includes students, academics and \nmedical professionals cutting across lines of race, education and class. The \ncentral aim of achieving universal ART access has united these groups, with \neach drawing on different relationships, power and connections to advance \nthe organisation\u2019s agenda. TAC\u2019s ability to provide support and hope to \notherwise very marginal women has enabled its success in attracting young \nunemployed black women, and it has been remarkably successful in placing \nthis group at the heart of the body politic (Robins & von Lires, 2008) \n \nTAC has been extremely successful in shaping South African policies around \nHIV\/AIDS and access to ART. In 2002, via TAC\u2019s court action and mass \npublic protest, the Constitutional Court confirmed that the South African \ngovernment had to provide Nevirapine to reduce the transmission of HIV from \nmother-to-child during birth in all public facilities. The following year, a civil \ndisobedience campaign, including the TAC\u2019s occupation of government \noffices and peaceful mass-arrests, led to international condemnation of \ngovernment policy. TAC effectively forced the government to sign a national \nstrategic plan on HIV\/AIDS, including an initial treatment programme (Deane, \n2003). Although this was not effectively implemented until 2006, TAC were \nsubsequently central in negotiating a widely praised National Strategic Plan \non HIV\/AIDS and STIs, that is currently positively shaping South African \npolicies, with TAC pushing to ensure the plan achieves an 80% coverage of \nART by 2011. These achievements have been remarkable in the context of a \nhighly stigmatised illness, where the ANC government sidelined social \nmovements from policy making, and where universal ART access was \ndeemed financially unrealistic. \n \nIn achieving policy change TAC has drawn on strategies including court \nchallenges utilizing the constitution to secure socio-economic rights, mass \npublic demonstrations and marches and civil disobedience supplemented by \nextensive grassroots mobilisation.  \n \nTAC: Building Voice \n \nTAC have worked hard to facilitate voice, critical thinking and collective \nagency amongst its members (Endresen & von Kotze, 2005). Treatment \nLiteracy has been a central goal, using dialogical approaches to disseminate \nscientific knowledge about HIV\/AIDS and ART. Members are encouraged to \nuse this knowledge to demand appropriate care and medicines in public \nclinics and from the state more broadly. It has also been highly successful in \nworking with members to link their personal troubles to the wider public \nchallenges of building a democratic South Africa, incorporating human rights, \ndemocratic accountability and a just political economy (Endresen and von \nKotze, 2005). \n \nTAC: Building Receptive Social Environments \n \nThe TAC \u2013 a household name in South Africa \u2013 has been exceptionally \nsuccessful in constructing a social environment that is receptive to its \ndemands, establishing itself as the central legitimate non-governmental actor \naround HIV\/AIDS. It has worked to become well recognised in the media, \nestablishing itself as the media\u2019s civil society \u2018voice of choice\u2019 in South Africa \nfor its ability to provide considered responses on a range of HIV\/AIDS related \nissues (Finlay, 2004). TAC has also used the media strategically to provide \nclear information on its activities. When in 2003 TAC started a civil \ndisobedience campaign, it took out full-page advertisements in newspapers, \nexplaining why it had decided to use such tactics to secure change. By \nframing its struggle as an un-contestable moral issue, it has mobilised the \nsupport of a wide range of prominent national and international \nconstituencies, making it very difficult for the government to challenge its \nclaims (Friedman & Mottiar, 2004).  \n \nTAC has relied heavily on a small group of prominent leaders, whose \nindividual talents have been central to TAC\u2019s success. A large, left-leaning \nnewspaper once referred to TAC\u2019s public profile as \u2018ZackieandMark\u2019, a \nreference to Zackie Achmat and Mark Heywood, two senior TAC office \nbearers (Beresford, 2002). These two, and a handful of others, have skilfully \nmanaged to keep TAC rooted in a politics of mass mobilisation while at the \nsame time using more \u2018elite\u2019 processes to push the organisation\u2019s agenda, \nEqually comfortable in both modes of struggle they have been able to \nrepresent the marginalised sick and poor in \u2018elite\u2019 settings, strategically using \ncourt actions which have led to many of the organisation\u2019s gains, as well as \nmobilising immensely powerful international networks.  \n \nThe organisation often draws on anti-apartheid symbols and imagery, and \nlocated its goals within South Africa\u2019s wider anti-colonialist struggles (Robins \n& von Lieres, 2004). The respected role played by certain key TAC leaders in \nthe anti-apartheid movement of the 1980s has contributed to their legitimacy \nin post-apartheid South Africa, as well as keeping them committed to the \nforms of social mobilisation and democratic processes used in anti-apartheid \ntimes. In addition Zackie Achmat played a pivotal role in coalescing \nwidespread respect and support for the TAC through his much-publicised and \nprincipled decision to not take ART, which he could well afford, until state-run \nuniversal-access pilot ART programmes were established in all nine of South \nAfrica\u2019s Provinces. \n \nTAC has consistently forged strategic bridging relationships including \nacademics, international activist organisations, the government at times, and \ntrade unions. These alliances have been central to success, increasing its \nlegitimacy nationally and internationally and allowing TAC to develop strong \nclaims through immediate access to high quality research on HIV\/AIDS.  \n \nThe Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU), the largest union \ncoalition in South Africa, and member of the ruling ANC tri-partite alliance, has \ngiven strong support to the TAC, and occupied a seat on TAC\u2019s National \nExecutive Committee (Friedman & Mottiar, 2004). In 2003, when TAC moved \ntowards civil disobedience, COSATU publicly announced that it was \nconsidering joining the action. Whilst it did not, this expression of support \nadded legitimacy, influence and strength to TAC\u2019s claims. Another relationship \nTAC has fostered is with the church, a large and popular institution with strong \nlinks to the government through its role in the anti-apartheid movement. \n \nTAC has also worked with the ANC government when appropriate. In 2001 \nTAC was a \u2018friend of the court\u2019, siding with the South African government \nwhen the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association took the government to \ncourt over its attempt to stop South Africa importing generic drugs. \nFurthermore, Zackie Achmat has always openly stated he is a member of the \nANC, and TAC has consistently tried to work with allies in government to \nchange policies. \n \nTAC: Challenges \n \nOther social movements and activists have criticised the TAC for being elitist \nand failing to be adequately antagonistic towards the state. Currently it has \nmoved into a supportive relationship with the government. Mark Heywood, a \nkey TAC organiser, while remaining critical of government, is now the Deputy \nChair of the South African National AIDS Council (a government body) and \nTAC has taken on a role in supporting and monitoring the implementation of \nthe new National Strategic Plan on HIV\/AIDS and STIs. Many of the goals of \nthe new National Strategic Plan resonate with TAC\u2019s aims and objectives.  \nThe organisation\u2019s sincere efforts to replace its original cadre of elite male \nsenior leaders with women emerging from its poor grassroots membership are \nproving fraught and challenging (Stephen, 2009). The organisation\u2019s ability to \nremain rooted in its grassroots membership, as well as continuing to articulate \na strong voice of conscience in its new relationship with the government \nremains to be seen.  \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nGlobalisation has created new patterns of wealth and inequality and new \nforms of struggle by the excluded, with social movements playing an \nincreasingly prominent role. We have highlighted three movements that have \nbuilt what Sen (1999) would characterise as the \u2018capabilities\u2019 of the poor to \nmake successful demands, using access to land, healthcare services and life-\nsaving drugs as the springboard for their activities. \n \nThe approaches used by these movements resonate with Freire\u2019s (1973) \nclaim that individuals are most likely to improve their own life chances through \nengaging in collective action to challenge the social circumstances that place \ntheir health at risk. Freire\u2019s work has profoundly influenced community \npsychology. As discussed in our introduction, however, many community \npsychologists have tended to throw the bulk of their energies into small-scale \nlocal community level activities to empower poor people from the \u2018bottom up\u2019, \nwithout enough attention to the challenges of creating the wider local, national \nand global social environments most likely to hear the voices of the poor and \nto support them in achieving their goals. We argue that promoting receptive \nsocial environments is vital for the success of social movements, and should \nthus be a key concern for community psychologists. \n \nWhilst the goals and contexts of the three case studies are very different in \nmany ways, a cross case comparison highlights commonalities in their modes \nof operation which enable us to make some general comments about their \npathways to success. \n \nIn relation to building the voice of the poor, each movement has devoted a \ngreat deal of time and energy to promoting critical thinking. As a result of this \nmembers have come to see their poverty and social disadvantage as the \nresult of social inequalities rather than simply the outcomes of factors such as \nindividual or community-level bad luck or incompetence. Each movement has \nbeen driven by a coherent and compelling and actionable political philosophy, \nwith action strategies flowing coherently and clearly out of critical analysis.  \n \nFurthermore, each movement has provided an exceptionally strong \norganisational framework for united action. All these factors have served to \nmotivate and enable the poor to engage in various forms of collective action, \nsuch as public protests, marches, land or government building occupations. \nThe commitment of the poor to each movement\u2019s particular core issue has \nalso been strengthened by the additional empowerment resulting from the \nprovision of other forms of education and capacity building \u2013 such as adult \neducation, treatment literacy and provision of schools for participants\u2019 \nchildren. \n \nHow have the movements managed to get powerful politicians to listen to their \ndemands? Here we distinguish between relational and symbolic aspects of a \nreceptive social environment (Campbell & Cornish, 2010). At a relational level, \neach movement has been able to unite a broad range of people behind its \nobjectives. This has been both horizontally, amongst similar level activists \ncommitted to similar issues in diverse and possibly geographically distanced \nlocal settings. It has also been done vertically, involving strategic alliances \nwith politically and economically powerful actors, often at the national and \ninternational levels. Whilst each organisation continues to be challenged by \nthe complexities of pulling together diverse constituencies with different \nideological, gender or class positions, the fact that they are able to succeed in \nthis politically complex challenge remains crucial to their success. Alliances \nhave been formed both with similar and dissimilar others committed to the \nsame issue (access to land, services or medical drugs) as well as linking \nmovements to actors and agencies pursuing different but related struggles \n(such as human rights, gender equality and food security). By creating a mass \nmovement of different interest groups, the movements gained a \u2018strength in \nnumbers\u2019 that demanded politicians\u2019 attention.  \n \nAs well as providing resources to keep social movements going, alliances \nhave provided links into elite political and legal networks. Such elite networks \nhave often played a key role in assisting poor communities to use the courts \nto mount effective legal challenges to unjust social policies \u2013 drawing on \nexisting laws or constitutional frameworks which may have been breached, or \nhave not been implemented in practice. Elite contacts have often also been \nvital in channelling the voices of the marginalised to the heart of high level \npolitical debate and decision making.  \n \nThe successes of these alliances have also had a symbolic dimension. \nEffective access to high level decision-makers has also been facilitated by \neach movement\u2019s formulation of simple and clear messages with strong moral \nresonance within important local, national or international ideological contexts. \nThus for example, it is difficult to deny the claim that people with AIDS \ndeserved access to life-saving ART, or that unused land should be used to \nfacilitate the survival of the poor rather than lying idle. Clear and simple \nmessages of this nature \u2013 skilfully transmitted via a \u2018politics of the moral high \nground\u2019 \u2013 allow a diverse range of otherwise very different constituencies to \ncoalesce around a clear objective. Highlighting connections to valued national \nideals (such as the anti-apartheid movement in the case of TAC, or the \nconstitutional commitment to land being productive in the case of MST) further \nenhances the legitimacy of the movements\u2019 demands. The skilful framing of \nthe demands as morally uncontestable made unity possible and resistance \ndifficult. \n \nA cross-cutting theme, also at the symbolic level, relates to the success \nthrough which each movement gained wide social legitimacy as the most \ncredible and convincing agents of their particular struggle. The media played \na key role in all three cases, providing an arena in which topics are framed, \nand through which individuals and groupings are accorded the right to speak \non particular issues. \n  \nAt a broader level and one that has only been hinted at in the case studies, is \nthe role the international symbolic context has played in supporting these \nsocial movements. As international discourses evolve this opens and closes \nspaces for social movements to capitalise on. Both TAC and JSA have \nbenefited from changes in the international discourses on HIV\/AIDS and \nprimary healthcare respectively. For JSA the re-emergent discourse on \nprimary healthcare, led by its global network PHM and clearly seen in the \nsupportive international reception of PHM\u2019s Global Health Watch 2 by elite \nhealth representatives, including the Lancet, illustrates how this changing \ninternational environment may open up receptive spaces for the claims of JSA \nwithin India. Similarly TAC\u2019s claims for universal access to ART have been \nsignificantly supported by the gradual shift towards accepting the need for \nuniversal treatment access within international health and donor \norganisations. These international changes create a context in which such \nideas are more likely to be listened to when advocated from below.  \n We hope that our characterisation of the successes of the MST, the JSA and \nthe TAC has illustrated our claim that community psychology could learn from \ngreater attention to the strategies they have used to create receptive social \nenvironments in which the voices of the poor are most likely to be heard. We \nare not suggesting that every movement will be able to replicate each of the \n\u2018success factors\u2019 we have drawn attention to here. Furthermore the success \nfactors that we have highlighted in these three particular case studies could \nbe argued to suggest that only national organisations can for instance build \nmedia support, develop links to other organisations and channel the voices of \nthe poor to the heart of national government in ways that significantly \ncontribute to expanding human freedoms and challenging poverty.  \n \nWhilst we have no doubt that larger social movements are most likely to get \nwidespread attention, we argue that smaller social movements operating \nmore locally could also develop similar contextually specific strategies for \npromoting receptive social environments in the local context. Gains in human \nfreedoms are not only achieved nationally, but also may also be achieved \nlocally, through struggles that never move beyond the local arena. But similar \nchallenges of building the voice of the excluded, and promoting a receptive \nsocial environment is which this is heard, would be as necessary in these \nlocal settings as they are in national ones.  \n \nREFERENCES \nAhmad, K.
