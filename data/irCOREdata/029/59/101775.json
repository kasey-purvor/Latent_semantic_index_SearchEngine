C. Smith*, J. D. Carey, D. C. Cox and S. R. P. Silva \n \nNano-Electronics Centre, Advanced Technology Institute, University of Surrey, Guildford, GU2 \n7XH, UK. \nThe field emission (FE) properties of groups of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), an individual CNT, \nand from a single gated CNT are measured using nano-manipulators fitted within an SEM \n(scanning electron microscope). We investigate the effect of the anode locations at anode to \nemitter tip distances as low as 1 \u00b5m. \n \nNano-manipulators were installed within an SEM chamber, and sharpened STM probes with end \nradius of 5 \u00b5m attached to the end of the two manipulators. The minimum step size achievable \nwas 40 nm, with the FE performed within the SEM chamber at a vacuum pressure in the range of \n10-7 Torr. Figure 1 shows the 2 nano-manipulators within the SEM chamber. The sequence of \nimages show one of the probes placed accurately above a single CNT. \n \n \n                 \n \n \n \n \n \nA group of multi walled CNT were attached randomly to the end of a carbon fibre, and their field \nemission characteristics recorded. It was noted that the position of the anode (which could be \nmeasured accurately within the SEM) played an important role in the performance of the emitter. \nBoth threshold field and enhancement factors were affected only at low anode to emitter tip \nseparations. To further our studies we performed similar emission experimentation on an isolated \nCNT. A CNT polystyrene polymer was physically broken to expose a CNT, and its edge scanned \nto find a suitable emitter. Field screening effects due to adjacent emitters were removed by our \nability to selectively burn off, or pull out unwanted CNTs. During FE testing the electron beam \nwas turned off as to not influence our results. \n1 mm 40 \u00b5m \n10 \u00b5m \nFigure 1.

If the separation is taken as the anode to tip \nseparation (D-h), rather than the anode to cathode separation (D), we see a decrease in \nenhancement factor as the anode approaches the CNT tip. This can be explained by the fact that \nat close anode proximity, the CNT cap to anode radius can be assumed to approximate a parallel \nplate, which would have an enhancement factor of 1. \n \n   \n \n \n \nFurther to our in-situ investigations, we were able to perform three terminal field emission on an \nisolated CNT. A bespoke gate electrode was fabricated by focussed ion beam (FIB) milling \n(figure 2 (a and b)), and accurately positioned above the CNT. Our results show that the presence \nof the gate electrode can screen the performance for the CNT emitter by up to 66%. Figure 3 \nshows the field emission characteristics for gate voltages ranging between 0 and 25 volts. The \nstar points are the results when the gate electrode was moved out of the field of view. \n0 100 200 300 400 500\n10-10\n10-9\n10-8\n10-7\n10-6\n Vg= 0V\n Vg= 5V\n Vg= 10V\n Vg= 15V\n Vg= 20V\n Vg= 25V\n Gate removed\nA\nno\nde\n c\nur\nre\nnt\n (A\n)\nAnode voltage (V)\n \n \n \n \n* Email: r.c.smith@eim.surrey.ac.uk \nFigure 2.
