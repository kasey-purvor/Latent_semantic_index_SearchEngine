Recently, research in anaesthesia has identified and developed a \ntaxonomy of the non-technical skills requisite for safety in the operating theatre. \nAlthough many of the principles related to performance and safety within anaesthesia \nare relevant to the ICU, relatively little research has been done to identify the non-\ntechnical skills required for safe practice within the intensive care unit. This review \nfocuses on ICU critical incident studies in order to examine whether the contributory \nfactors identified as underlying critical incidents are associated with the skill \ncategories (e.g. task management, teamwork, situation awareness and decision \nmaking) outlined in the Anaesthetists\u2019 Non-technical Skills (ANTS) taxonomy. The \nreview found that a large proportion of the contributory factors underlying critical \nincident can be attributed to a non-technical skill category outlined in the ANTS \ntaxonomy. This is informative both for future critical incident reporting, and also as \nan indication that the ANTS taxonomy may provide a good starting point for the \ndevelopment of a non-technical skills taxonomy for intensive care. However, the ICU \npresents a range of unique challenges to the practitioners working within it. It is \ntherefore necessary to conduct further non-technical skills research, using human \nfactors techniques such as root-cause analyses, observations of behaviour, attitudinal \nsurveys, studies of cognition, and structured interviews to better understand the non-\ntechnical skills important for safety within the ICU. Examples of such research \nhighlight the utility of these techniques.  \n \n \nPublished as: Reader, T., Flin, R., Lauche, K., & Cuthbertson, B. (2006).

British Journal of Anaesthesia, 96, 551-559. \n \n3 \nThe Department of Health\u2019s report on patient safety has encouraged healthcare \nproviders in areas such as anaesthesia and intensive care medicine to emulate high-\nrisk industries, for example aviation and nuclear power, in the application of human \nfactors research to enhance safety 9. In aviation, pilots\u2019 skills not directly related to \ntechnical expertise, but crucial for maintaining safety are called non-technical skills, \nand include interpersonal skills such as communication, teamwork and leadership, and \ncognitive skills such as task management, situation awareness and decision-making 2, \n16\n. Within the nuclear power and aviation industries, the specific non-technical skills \nimportant for protecting against errors have been empirically identified and trained \nthrough Crew Resource Management courses 41. During the last 20 years, the \nimportance of non-technical skills for delivering safe and high-quality medical care \nhas been increasingly recognised, if not explicitly addressed in medical training 31.  \nMore recently, research has begun to identify the specific non-technical skills \nimportant for safety in medical domains such as Anaesthesia and Surgery 15, 21, 25, 45. \nEach working environment has its own unique non-technical requirements. Although \nthe principal skill categories may be generic and relatively transferable across \ndomains 19, the component behaviours that demonstrate proficiency in those skills \nwithin a particular environment (e.g. the operating room) will be specific to the needs \nand characteristics of a domain 27, 31. Rall and Gaba 34 have pointed out that many of \nthe principles related to performance and safety within anaesthesia are also pertinent \nto the ICU. The current article reflects on the relevance to the intensive care \nenvironment of the non-technical skills identified as being important for anaesthetists \nin the operating theatre.  \n \nPublished as: Reader, T., Flin, R., Lauche, K., & Cuthbertson, B. (2006). Non-technical skills in the Intensive Care Unit. British Journal of Anaesthesia, 96, 551-559. \n \n4 \n \nThe Anaesthetists\u2019 Non-Technical Skills (ANTS) behavioural marker system  \nWithin anaesthesia, a taxonomy of the non-technical skills important for safety in the \noperating theatre, called the Anaesthetists' Non-Technical Skills (ANTS) behavioural \nmarker system, has been produced. This was developed from an analysis of data from \ncritical incident reporting systems, attitudinal surveys, theoretical models, \nobservations and the judgements of consultant anaesthetists 13, 35. The ANTS \ntaxonomy has 15 skill elements in four categories with observable examples of good \nand poor behaviours that demonstrate non-technical skill proficiencies or deficits (See \nFigure 1). This can be used to structure non-technical skills training for anaesthetists \n17\n, and the ANTS behavioural rating form can be used to assess anaesthetists\u2019 non-\ntechnical skills in theatre or in the simulator. For example, Yee et al 44 have shown, \nusing the ANTS rating system in Canada, that taking part in anaesthesia crisis \nmanagement courses results in an improvement in the non-technical skills of \nanaesthesia residents. While many anaesthetists are involved in intensive care \nmedicine, the ANTS system was specifically designed to represent their non-technical \nskills in an operating theatre environment. To date, relatively little research has \nfocussed upon identifying the non-technical skills important for protecting against \nhuman error in the ICU. However, studies examining human performance in the ICU \nhave indicated the importance of non-technical skills such as teamwork and \ncommunication for safety and effective functioning 12, 22, 39.  \n \nWithin the intensive care literature there exist a number of data sources identifying \ncommon causal factors underlying critical incidents in the ICU. Frey et al 20 highlight \nthe fact that ICU critical incident reporting systems provide a source of information \nPublished as: Reader, T., Flin, R., Lauche, K., & Cuthbertson, B. (2006). Non-technical skills in the Intensive Care Unit. British Journal of Anaesthesia, 96, 551-559. \n \n5 \nthat can be used for quality improvement. However, a recent patient safety report 1 \npoints out that although lessons are learnt at a local level from UK incident \nmonitoring systems, these improvements do not tend to be shared more widely. By \nusing critical incident reporting data to identify behaviours that are commonly found \nto contribute to a critical incident, some insight can be gained into the non-technical \nskills important for safety in the ICU. The current article provides a summary of the \nnon-technical skill factors commonly associated with critical incidents in published \nICU studies. The emerging factors were compared to the non-technical skills \ncategories and elements identified by the ANTS behavioural marker system to see if \nthis provided a suitable fit. As the principles related to performance and safety within \nanaesthesia and the ICU are similar, the generic skill categories (e.g. teamwork) \nidentified as being important for anaesthesia may also be important for the ICU, even \nthough the setting and work tasks are different.  \nPublished as: Reader, T., Flin, R., Lauche, K., & Cuthbertson, B. (2006). Non-technical skills in the Intensive Care Unit. British Journal of Anaesthesia, 96, 551-559. \n \n6 \nMethod \nThe identification of research articles involved a comprehensive search of the \nMedline, Biomed Central and Web of Knowledge Psychology databases for English \nlanguage papers related to critical incidents and errors in the intensive care unit (see \nfigure 2 for a flow diagram of the review methodology). Search terms were: Intensive \ncare \/ non-technical skills \/ ICU \/ critical incidents \/ errors \/ adverse events. The \nsearch was limited to article titles and abstracts. Articles initially found (n=754) were \nscrutinised for possible inclusion through the relevance of their titles, and then \nabstracts. This left a total of 24 possible articles. The remaining articles were then \nfiltered for inclusion if they met the criteria of: i) using data collected exclusively in \nthe ICU; and ii) allowing for contributory factors referring to non-technical skills (as \nspecified by the ANTS taxonomy) to be documented in the analysis of critical \nincidents. A total of 11 articles met these criteria, and were then analysed using the \nANTS taxonomy 13. The ANTS behavioural marker system identifies four core \ncategories of non-technical skills (see figure 2), each comprised of several elements, \nand for each element, exemplar component behaviours relevant to actual practice in \nanaesthesia 13, 14, 16. The four core non-technical skill categories include: \nTask Management: \u2018Managing resources and organising tasks to achieve goals\u2026\u2019 \nTeam Working: \u2018Skills for working in a group context, in any role, to ensure \njoint task completion and team satisfaction\u2026\u2019 \nSituation Awareness: \u2018Developing and maintaining an overall dynamic awareness of \nthe situation based on perceiving the elements in the \nenvironment\u2026 understanding what they mean and thinking \nahead\u2026\u2019 \nPublished as: Reader, T., Flin, R., Lauche, K., & Cuthbertson, B. (2006). Non-technical skills in the Intensive Care Unit. British Journal of Anaesthesia, 96, 551-559. \n \n7 \nDecision Making: \u2018Making decisions to reach a judgement or diagnosis about a \nsituation, or to select a course of action, based on experience or \nnew information\u2026\u2019 \n \nEach article was reviewed in order to identify the contributing factors underlying \nincidents that were associated with non-technical skills. This was done by examining \nthe individual contributing factors identified in each article, and then assessing \nwhether they could be clearly identified as belonging to a particular non-technical \nskill category, as outlined in the Anaesthetists\u2019 Non-Technical Skills (ANTS) \nhandbook 16. Each contributory factor was classified according to the overall skill \ncategory to which it was found to refer. For example, contributory factors such as \n\u2018inadequate assistance\u2019 would be classified as being indicative of teamwork skills, \n\u2018distraction or inattention\u2019 would be classified as indicative of situation awareness \nskills, \u2018errors of judgement\u2019 as decision making skills, and \u2018failure to check \nequipment\u2019 as task management skills. If suitable numerical data were included in the \narticle, the total number of contributory factors associated with non-technical skills \nwas calculated, as was the proportion that each individual factor contributed (see table \n1). Furthermore, for all of the studies reviewed, the proportion of contributory factors \nthat each of the four non-technical skill categories accounted for was calculated. To \navoid a bias towards studies reporting large numbers of contributory factors, \npercentage data was used instead of raw data. This involved a 2-stage process; where \nfor each study the total percentage of non-technical skill contributory factors that each \nskill category accounted for was calculated. These percentages were then aggregated, \nwith the mean percentage of contributory factors identified as belonging to each non-\ntechnical skill category being shown in figure 3. Lastly, the percentage of contributory \nPublished as: Reader, T., Flin, R., Lauche, K., & Cuthbertson, B. (2006). Non-technical skills in the Intensive Care Unit. British Journal of Anaesthesia, 96, 551-559. \n \n8 \nfactors, out of all possible contributory factors, associated with non-technical skills \nwas calculated (49%). The non-technical skill classification process was conducted by \nthree applied psychologists familiar with the non-technical skills literature. The \ncontributory factors underlying incidents were independently classified in terms of the \nnon-technical skills outlined in the ANTS handbook. For all of the factors in Table 1, \nthere was a 91% level agreement by at least 2 assessors for the underlying ANTS \ncategory, and 71% agreement by all 3 assessors. For factors where there was no initial \nagreement, the assessors collaboratively referred to the ANTS handbook in order to \nreach a final agreement on the underlying ANTS category. It is notable that the \ncontributory factors documented in the critical incident studies do not document one \nsingle practitioner role in the ICU (i.e. the role of both nurses and doctors are \nconsidered), and thus at this stage, the analysis is not role specific. Furthermore, each \nfactor does not refer to one incident, and thus a combination of factors may be \nunderlying any single critical incident.  \n \nResults and Discussion \nIt can be seen from table 1 that a wide range of contributory factors associated with \ncritical incidents can be accounted for by the non-technical skill categories outlined in \nthe ANTS taxonomy. Overall, out of 2677 incidents and 5610 total contributory \nfactors, 50% can be attributed to some form of non-technical skill deficit. These \nfigures do not include the Hart et al 24 study as it does not provide numerical data on \nthe contributory factors underlying incidents. Across all of the studies, Task \nManagement was found to account for the greatest proportion of non-technical skill \ncontributory factors (figure 3). The second greatest was Situation Awareness, the third \ngreatest was Team Working, and the fourth greatest was Decision Making. However, \nPublished as: Reader, T., Flin, R., Lauche, K., & Cuthbertson, B. (2006). Non-technical skills in the Intensive Care Unit. British Journal of Anaesthesia, 96, 551-559. \n \n9 \nthis breakdown is entirely constrained by the type of data the reviewed critical \nincident studies were designed to capture. For example, critical incident studies tend \nto vary in the different categories and types of data they collect, with some studies \ncollecting very minimal non-technical skills related data. This may explain the high \nproportion of incidents associated with task management, as critical incidents studies \ntend to show a bias for capturing technical contributory factors related to task \nmanagement skills, e.g. checking equipment, following protocols, inadequate \npreparation of patients. However, less provision may exist for capturing contributory \nfactors associated with non-technical skills such as decision-making, e.g. failing to \nconsider options, not asking others for suggestions, or being unwilling to revise \ncourses of action in the light of new information.  \n \nA further limitation of critical incident studies is that they lack a fine-grained analysis \nof the non-technical factors underlying incidents. In the current review, although \ncontributory factors such as \u2018errors of judgment\u2019 and \u2018failure to follow protocol\u2019 may \nshow face validity with skills such as \u2018decision making\u2019 and \u2018task management\u2019, the \nprecise details underlying those factors cannot be ascertained. For example \u2018errors of \njudgment\u2019 may arise due to deficiencies in recognizing and understanding information \n(i.e. situation awareness), \u2018and failure to follow protocol\u2019 might arise due to a lack of \nsupervision (i.e. teamwork\/leadership). Also, a considerable number of contributory \nfactors identified in the study were not possible to classify due to the underlying non-\ntechnical skill not being obviously apparent. For example, factors such as \u2018insufficient \nstaff\u2019 might be associated with task management, or may be more indicative of \nstaffing policies.  Lastly, it can be seen that although the Hart et al. 24 study does not \ninclude numerical data, it does provide some supporting evidence for the relevance to \nPublished as: Reader, T., Flin, R., Lauche, K., & Cuthbertson, B. (2006). Non-technical skills in the Intensive Care Unit. British Journal of Anaesthesia, 96, 551-559. \n \n10 \nthe ICU of the non-technical skills described in the ANTS taxonomy, as well as \nhighlighting the utility of including numerical data when analysing accident \ncausation.   \n \nDespite the above issues, the current review does demonstrate that even though a \nvariety of different contributory factors are captured by ICU critical incident studies, a \nlarge proportion of these can be attributed to the non-technical skill categories \noutlined in the ANTS taxonomy. This is both informative for the future development \nand use of data from critical incident reporting systems, as well as being indicative \nthat the ANTS taxonomy may provide a good starting point for the development of a \nnon-technical skills taxonomy for intensive care. However, it is also apparent that \nfurther research, using a range of techniques, is required for better identifying the \nnon-technical skills necessary for maintaining safety in the ICU.  The ANTS system \nused several techniques to collect data regarding practice in anaesthesia in order to \ngenerate a non-technical skills taxonomy tailored for the anaesthetists\u2019 role in the \noperating room 14. \n \nThe techniques for gathering the basic skill set can include root-cause analyses, \nobservations of behaviours in real-time and simulated environments, attitudinal \nsurveys, studies of cognition, and structured interviews 2, 15, 26, 36. Each technique \nprovides different forms of data. For example, root-cause analysis describes in detail \nthe precise factors underlying critical incidents but can be limited to a specific \nscenario or procedure as well as the analysis procedure used to assess the incident. \nObservational approaches record behaviour as it occurs in a variety of conditions, for \nexample during an emergency procedure, although it is difficult in real-life studies for \nPublished as: Reader, T., Flin, R., Lauche, K., & Cuthbertson, B. (2006). Non-technical skills in the Intensive Care Unit. British Journal of Anaesthesia, 96, 551-559. \n \n11 \nobservers to capture all the events that occur within an environment, furthermore \nthere is the potential for participant behaviours to be altered by the presence of a \nresearcher. Attitudinal surveys highlight opinions on the importance of skills such as \nteamwork, and are informative about the social and organizational factors that affect \nperceptions of error and rule compliance, through generally do not provide specific \ninformation about the non-technical skills underlying good performance. Studies of \ncognition use experimental methods to model and understand the factors that affect \ncognitive processes (e.g. decision-making) within a particular environment, but are \nalso susceptible to participant behaviours being altered by the experimental paradigm, \ne.g. the use of a low fidelity simulator. Structured interviews utilize the knowledge \nand experience of domain experts in ascertaining the non-technical skills required for \ncoping with emergency and routine situations, although perceptions of confidentiality, \nand the relationship between the interviewer and interviewee, can affect the data \nobtained. \n \nThe techniques described above could provide a rich source of non-technical skills \ninformation for the ICU, as well as providing useful examples for developing training \nmaterials.  Although research focussing on non-technical skills in the ICU is still very \nmuch in its infancy, there are examples of research within both the critical care and \npsychology literatures that have used the human factors techniques described above. \nExamples of such studies were found during the earlier literature search, and whilst \nnot containing suitable data for inclusion in the critical incident review, are potentially \ninformative and are therefore discussed below. Included in the following four sections \nare examples of human factors research using root-cause analysis, observational \nstudies, studies of cognition, and attitudinal surveys, that have been found to yield \nPublished as: Reader, T., Flin, R., Lauche, K., & Cuthbertson, B. (2006). Non-technical skills in the Intensive Care Unit. British Journal of Anaesthesia, 96, 551-559. \n \n12 \ninformation regarding the non-technical skills required for safe practice in the ICU. \nAlthough the findings of such research does not explicitly describe in detail the non-\ntechnical skills required for the intensive care environment, and are insufficient for \ndeveloping a taxonomy of non-technical skills in the ICU, they do provide \ninformative data with respect to validating and describing the relevance to the ICU of \nthe non-technical skill categories outlined in the ANTS taxonomy. \n \nRoot-cause analysis of ICU adverse events \nRoot cause analysis identifies the fundamental causes of more serious critical \nincidents, and distinguishes the technical and non-technical contributory factors that \noriginated from both the local and organisational environment. In particular, root-\ncause analyses of adverse events in US ICUs published by Pronovost and colleagues \n32, 33\n underlined the importance of the non-technical skill category of team working, \nand specifically communication processes that support good team working, in the \nprevention of incidents. For example, in a case where a patient suffering hospital-\nacquired pneumonia was accidentally given an undiluted medication 32, a lack of \ncommunication and understanding between an ICU doctor and trainee nurse for the \nmedication handover procedure was identified as one of the main contributory factors. \nIn another case, where a patient being treated for heart and renal failures suffered an \nair embolism after a large central venous catheter was removed whilst the patient was \nsitting up 33, one of the main contributory factors identified as underlying the incident \nwas the reluctance of a nurse, who recognised that the catheter removal was being \ndone incorrectly, to speak up and correct the trainee doctor conducting the procedure. \nThus, root-cause analyses can provide non-technical skills information relating to \nboth a particular situation, such as a lack of shared understanding for team member \nPublished as: Reader, T., Flin, R., Lauche, K., & Cuthbertson, B. (2006). Non-technical skills in the Intensive Care Unit. British Journal of Anaesthesia, 96, 551-559. \n \n13 \nroles in a specific procedure, or a more general aspect of teamwork, such as the need \nfor open communication between doctors and nurses.  \n \nObservational studies of ICU teams in real-life and simulators \nNon-technical skill competencies in the ICU can be further investigated through \nobservational studies, which involves either observations of real-life environments, or \nof videotaped ICU scenarios that take place in medical simulators. Lighthall et al 28 \nobserved the performance of ICU staff on a training course which realistically \nsimulates the intensive care environment and presents cases which challenge both \nmedical and non-technical skills. Their analysis identified commonly occurring types \nof errors relating to the non-technical skill categories of situation awareness, decision \nmaking, teamwork and task management, and their specific impact upon the provision \nof care. Vigilance and fixation errors such as failing to recognise changes on \nmonitors, not responding to ventilator alarms, and failing to periodically check patient \nstatus whilst placing a line, resulted in unrecognised deteriorations in the simulated \npatient condition. Judgement errors such as placing a catheter in a deteriorating \npatient, and being complacent with abnormal vital signs, resulted in inappropriate \ndelays of therapy and clinical deterioration. Communication and task management \nerrors such as failing to communicate priorities, overloading nurses with requests, and \nnot following up inquiries on lab results resulted in insignificant tasks being done \ninstead of key tasks, tasks not being done in a timely manner, and forgotten requests \nnot being identified.  \n \nA real-life observational study conducted by Donchin and colleagues 12 has also \nunderlined the importance of detailing team competencies required for safe practice in \nPublished as: Reader, T., Flin, R., Lauche, K., & Cuthbertson, B. (2006). Non-technical skills in the Intensive Care Unit. British Journal of Anaesthesia, 96, 551-559. \n \n14 \nthe ICU. The study investigated the nature and causes of errors in an Israeli ICU \ncollected data over a period of 4 months, and involved observers noting all activities, \ninteractions and errors that occurred around patient bedsides. Out of the 8178 \nactivities recorded, approximately 1% were erroneous, with doctors being found to \ncommit around half of all errors despite being involved in just 4.7% of activities. In \nparticular, team working problems were highlighted as being an important factor in \nthe occurrence of errors, with verbal communication between nurses and doctors \nbeing reported in 37% of errors, despite being observed in only 2% of activities. \nDonchin and colleagues hypothesized that this may have occurred due to informal \ncommunication exchanges, and misunderstandings and misperceptions during \ncommunication. Therefore, observational studies in real-life and simulators can \nassociate certain non-technical skills (e.g. team working) with measurable outcomes \n(e.g. errors), as well as understanding the causes and environments in which \nbehaviours and errors occur. \n \nAttitudes towards non-technical skills in the ICU \nAttitudinal studies in the ICU have also focussed upon non-technical skills, with \nsurveys in the US examining the attitudes of ICU staff with respect to teamwork and \nerror. These studies have shown that the majority of both nurses and doctors feel that \njunior team members should be able to question senior members, and that decision-\nmaking should include more team member input 38. However, it has also been found \nthat more nurses than doctors report finding it difficult to speak-up in the ICU, and \nthat fewer nurses than doctors report feeling that their input about patient care is well \nreceived, that disagreements in the ICU are properly resolved, and that teamwork \nbetween nurses and doctors is well coordinated 40. Furthermore, whilst the majority of \nPublished as: Reader, T., Flin, R., Lauche, K., & Cuthbertson, B. (2006). Non-technical skills in the Intensive Care Unit. British Journal of Anaesthesia, 96, 551-559. \n \n15 \nICU staff acknowledge the importance of medical errors, they also report having \ndifficulty in openly discussing mistakes due to factors such as the expectations of \nother staff members and negative personal implications 38. Thus, attitudinal studies \ncan be useful in that they highlight the fact that a number of organisational factors \nmay influence the use of non-technical skills such as teamworking in the ICU. For \nexample a lack of perceived communication openness between nurses and doctors \nmay make nurses reticent to become involved in patient care decisions, and the \nnegative personal implications associated with discussing errors may result in the root \ncauses behind errors not being identified and addressed.  \n \nStudies of cognition in the ICU \nStudies of cognition in the intensive care unit have described the processes underlying \ndecision making by ICU staff during their provision of care to patients. Decision-\nmaking is a non-technical skill that has been researched by a number of psychologists, \nwith studies examining whether expert decision-making in the ICU relies on similar \ncognitive processes to other complex work domains. Patel and Arocha 29 have studied \ndecision-making processes by consultants in US surgical and medical ICUs, where \ncaregivers face different problems. An analysis of audiotape transcripts from the \nmorning rounds revealed that in the medical ICU (where it is necessary to diagnose \npatient conditions and then make treatment decisions) there was a tendency for \ndecisions to be made using \u2018backwards driven reasoning\u2019. This involved developing a \nhypothesis about a situation and then testing and refining it against the available data \nbefore coming to a solution. By contrast, in the surgical ICU (where patients were \nrecovering from a surgical procedure, and thus their diagnosis was better understood), \ndecisions were found to be made through \u2018forwards driven reasoning\u2019. This involved \nPublished as: Reader, T., Flin, R., Lauche, K., & Cuthbertson, B. (2006). Non-technical skills in the Intensive Care Unit. British Journal of Anaesthesia, 96, 551-559. \n \n16 \nfirst gathering information about a situation and then recognising the solution from \nthe perceived data. Likewise, Cesna and Mosier asked nurses how they would react to \nan emergency situation in the ICU 10. Expert nurses tended to immediately recognise \nthe best solution for the situation. In contrast, less experienced nurses were shown to \nhave a tendency to generate several options, with the best option not being generated \nfirst. In both studies, decision making was found to be consistent with recognition \nprimed decision-making 30, a form of naturalistic decision making where an expert \nrelies on their experience and knowledge to \u2018pattern match\u2019 or recognise a situation, \nand then recall a viable course of action without having to consider all the \nalternatives.  \n \nStudies of cognition can be highly useful for understanding the processes underlying \nnon-technical skills such as decision making, and whilst not providing a direct \nrelationship between non-technical skills and safety, insight can be gained with \nregards to training and enhancing non-technical skills. For example, as expert \ndecision makers are found to focus their attention on identifying situational features \nrather than choosing between options, training could focus on situation awareness \nskills such as altering scanning behaviours in accordance with patient conditions, and \nimproving communication and cross-checking amongst team members so that \ninformation necessary for decision-making is shared immediately. Alternatively, less \nexperienced decision makers could be trained to develop the mental models and \npatterns they require for recognising situations and associated solutions 43.  \n \nPublished as: Reader, T., Flin, R., Lauche, K., & Cuthbertson, B.

British Journal of Anaesthesia, 96, 551-559. \n \n17 \nConclusion  \nThe current review of contributory factors underlying critical incidents demonstrates \nan overlap between the non-technical skills requirements of the ICU and anaesthesia, \nwith both domains having a need for good teamwork, situation awareness, task \nmanagement and decision-making skills. This is consistent with other high-risk \ndomains, such as aviation, where non-technical skill competencies for the same skills \nare recognised as being crucial for safe practice, and are taught through tailored \ntraining packages. Furthermore, to teach and reliably assess non-technical skills \nwithin a particular domain it is necessary to identify the component behaviours that \ndemonstrate proficiencies of these skills within the domain 31. Each work environment \nhas its own particular needs and characteristics, and the behaviours that demonstrate \nnon-technical skill competencies within the ICU will be specific to the demands of \nintensive care medicine, as well as the roles and responsibilities of caregivers.  \n \nTherefore, it can be concluded that it is necessary to further research the non-technical \nskill proficiencies required for safe practice in the ICU, and to describe them in \nsufficient detail so that they can be taught and reliably assessed. Ideally, as non-\ntechnical skill training programmes are integrated with the technical aspects of a \ndomain, training packages are implemented once professionals have an adequate level \nof technical competence. This also reduces the cognitive load of having to learn both \ntechnical and non-technical skills simultaneously. The current review demonstrates \nthat the framework of non-technical skill categories identified in the ANTS taxonomy \nis also pertinent to the ICU, and thus provides a useful foundation for future \ninvestigations. Research using other investigation techniques, including root-cause \nanalysis, attitudinal surveys, structured interviews, observational studies, and studies \nPublished as: Reader, T., Flin, R., Lauche, K., & Cuthbertson, B.

Although research focussing specifically on \nnon-technical skill competencies for the ICU is limited, examples of research in the \nICU using human factors techniques can be found to both support the importance of \nthe non-technical skill categories outlined in the ANTS taxonomy, as well as \nproviding examples of how such research can aid in identifying the non-technical skill \ncompetencies required for intensive care. Through using a combination of all the \nresearch techniques described, future work can better understand the nature and key \nchallenges of the ICU environment, its\u2019 non-technical skill requirements, the \nbehaviours that demonstrate non-technical skill proficiencies, and the organizational \nfactors that affect the quality of non-technical skills demonstrated by nurses and \ndoctors in the ICU.  \nPublished as: Reader, T., Flin, R., Lauche, K., & Cuthbertson, B.
