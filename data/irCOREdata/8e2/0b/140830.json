Most research to date has focussed on surface and near-surface\nhydrological pathways, under the common assumption that little P leaches to\ngroundwater. Here we present an analysis of national patterns of groundwater\nphosphate concentrations in England and Wales, Scotland, and the Republic of\nIreland, which shows that many groundwater bodies have median P concentrations\nabove ecologically significant thresholds for freshwaters. The potential risk to\nreceptor ecosystems of high observed groundwater P concentrations will depend on\n(1) whether the observed groundwater P concentrations are above the natural\nbackground; (2) the influence of local hydrogeological settings (pathways) on\nthe likelihood of significant P transfers to the receptor; (3) the sensitivity\nof the receptor to P; and, (4) the relative magnitude of P transfers from\ngroundwater compared to other P sources. Our research suggests that, although\nthere is often a high degree of uncertainty in many of these factors,\ngroundwater has the potential to trigger and\/or maintain eutrophication under\ncertain scenarios: the assumption of groundwater contribution to river flows as\na ubiquitous source of dilution for P-rich surface runoff must therefore be\nquestioned.

Most research to \ndate has focussed on surface and near-surface hydrological pathways, under the common \nassumption that little P leaches to groundwater.  Here we present an analysis of national \npatterns of groundwater phosphate concentrations in England and Wales, Scotland, and the \nPage 2 of 29 \n \nRepublic of Ireland, that shows many groundwater bodies have median P concentrations \nabove ecologically significant thresholds for freshwaters.  The potential risk to receptor \necosystems of high observed groundwater P concentrations will depend on (1) whether the \nobserved groundwater P concentrations are above the natural background; (2) the influence of \nlocal hydrogeological settings (pathways) on the likelihood of significant P transfers to the \nreceptor; (3) the sensitivity of the receptor to P; and, (4) the relative magnitude of P transfers \nfrom groundwater compared to other P sources.  Our research suggests that, although there is \noften a high degree of uncertainty in many of these factors, groundwater has the potential to \ntrigger and\/or maintain eutrophication under certain scenarios:  the assumption of \ngroundwater contribution to river flows as a ubiquitous source of dilution for P-rich surface \nrunoff must therefore be questioned.  Given the regulatory importance of P concentrations in \ntriggering ecological quality thresholds, there is an urgent need for detailed monitoring and \nresearch to characterise the extent and magnitude of different groundwater P sources, the \nlikelihood for P transformation and\/or storage along aquifer-hyporheic zone flowpaths and to \nidentify the subsequent risk to receptor ecosystems. \n \nKeywords: leaching, eutrophication, baseflow, orthophosphate, phosphorus \n \nIntroduction \nHigh concentrations of biologically available phosphorus (P) in freshwater ecosystems are \ncommonly associated with elevated rates of primary productivity and resultant changes in \necosystem composition (Mainstone and Parr, 2002; Withers and Lord, 2002).  Major research \nefforts have been made in attempting to quantify the principal P sources in different \ncatchment systems in an effort to understand and manage eutrophication (Foy, 2005; Withers \nand Haygarth, 2007;  Weatherhead and Howden, 2009).   Most work, thus far, has made the \ndistinction between point-sources, such as sewage treatment plants, and diffuse-sources, such \nas transfers from agricultural soils during storm events (Edwards and Withers, 2007; Howden \net al., 2009).  The predominant research focus for diffuse-source transfers from land to water \nhas been directed to surface (Heathwaite et al., 2006; Withers and Haygarth, 2007; Burt et al., \n2008) and near-surface (Heathwaite and Dils, 2000; Hodgkinson et al., 2002) hydrological \npathways.  Transport of phosphorus to groundwater and potential P contributions to surface \nwaters via baseflow are generally assumed to be negligible because of the high potential for \nmobile phosphorus to be retained in the upper soil horizons by adsorption (e.g. to calcite) or \nmetal complex formation (commonly with iron, aluminium or manganese in acidic soils:  e.g. \nAddiscott and Thomas, 2000).  Nevertheless, relatively high concentrations of phosphorus \nhave been reported for some groundwater bodies (Kilroy, 2001; Kilroy and Coxon, 2005; \nHolman et al., 2008) which suggest that groundwater has potential to act as a P source for \nsurface waters, provided it is not removed along the groundwater-surface water pathway (e.g. \nGriffioen, 2006).  In the UK, monitored groundwater P concentrations have historically been \ncompared with the EU drinking water standard (2200 \u00b5g P L\n-1\n) and have, therefore, not been \nPage 3 of 29 \n \n \nidentified as a concern.  If ecologically-based surface water thresholds (Howden et al., 2009) \nare used as a reference point, however, measured groundwater P concentrations become more \nsignificant, particularly since groundwater contributions (as a proportion of total flow) are \ngreatest during low (base-) flow conditions which are often coincident with optimum \nconditions for primary productivity in spring and summer (Mainstone and Parr, 2002).  In \nsome freshwaters and groundwater-dependent wetlands, such as fens (particularly in the \nabsence of point-source discharges), relatively low concentrations of groundwater-P could, \ntherefore, exert a fundamental control on baseline ecosystem function (Neal et al., 2008).  \nHence, it is important to develop our understanding of groundwater-P source(s) (i.e. \nanthropogenic or natural) and the potential risks posed by groundwater-P to good ecological \nquality in surface waters. \nThis paper presents an overview of groundwater-P concentrations in the UK and Republic of \nIreland based on historical data from national routine monitoring.  It extends a preliminary \noverview presented by Holman et al. (2008) which focussed on phosphate in groundwater \nbodies in England and Wales. \nSpecifically, four questions are considered: \nAre there spatial patterns in groundwater-P concentrations in England and Wales, Scotland, \nNorthern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland? \nAre there potential links between groundwater-P concentrations and land use? \nWhat are the potential implications of groundwater P concentrations for surface-water quality \nand ecological management?  \nWhat are the implications of the findings for future monitoring requirements in both ground \nand surface waters, specifically with regard to required limits of detection? \n \nData and Methods \nNational datasets \nOver 48,000 measurements of groundwater P concentrations were collated from national \nmonitoring datasets for the UK and Ireland (see summary:  Table 1).  The data originated \nfrom almost 3600 groundwater monitoring sites (Figure 1) and were collected between 1968 \nand 2007.  Differences in filtering, analytical methods, P determinands and Limits of \nDetection (LOD) were evident between countries (Table 1) as follows: \nEngland and Wales (Environment Agency monitoring), Scotland (Scottish Environment \nProtection Agency monitoring) and Republic of Ireland (Environmental Protection Agency \nmonitoring):  Samples are not routinely filtered.  Colorimetric analysis is used to give total \nPage 4 of 29 \n \nreactive phosphorus, via the molybdate reaction.  This is, however, reported by the agencies \nas Orthophosphate as P because the majority of the total reactive phosphorus in groundwater \nsamples is expected to be in the form of dissolved orthophosphate, given that concentrations \nof suspended solids and organic matter in groundwater are normally low. \nNorthern Ireland (Environment and Heritage Service monitoring):  Samples are routinely \nfiltered in the field and analysed using ICP-MS to give total dissolved phosphorus.   \nThe term phosphorus is used within the paper with respect to orthophosphate as P unless \notherwise stated. \n \nLimits of detection \nIn the context of assessing potential risks to surface water receptors from groundwater-P, the \ntreatment of samples below LOD is important because surface water phosphate thresholds for \neutrophication can be as low as 10 to 30 \u00b5g L\n-1\n (Stevenson et al., 2008).  Detection limits \nwere inconsistent between: countries; groundwater bodies within the same country; and also \nwithin individual datasets.  To assess the sensitivity of the analyses to the LOD, the LODs \nwere initially considered by treating samples with concentrations below LOD in four different \nways: (1) as zero; (2) as LOD; (3)  as half LOD; and (4) removing all samples below LOD.  \nTemporal analysis of groundwater-P \nThe groundwater-P data has been analysed with regard to the timing of sample collection, \ntiming of observed high concentrations and national trends.  The distribution of samples by \nmonth of collection in England and Wales, Scotland and Ireland were examined to assess \nwhether there are temporal biases in sampling.  The month of collection of samples with \nconcentrations greater than 5, 10 or 20 times the median concentration for the given \ngroundwater monitoring site were analysed for patterns in the timing of such peak \nconcentrations.  Finally, national average median groundwater P concentrations were \ncalculated from all samples collected within the given calendar year to identify any national \ntrends in groundwater P concentration. \nSpatial distribution of groundwater-P \nNational groundwater-P distribution was investigated at the groundwater body scale, by \nassigning data from groundwater monitoring sites to their respective regionally-defined \ngroundwater bodies using a point-in-polygon procedure within a Geographical Information \nSystem.  Median groundwater body P-concentrations were calculated from the median \nconcentration values at individual sites for which more than one measurement was available, \nand single sample concentration values for sites with only one measurement.  This normalised \nthe sites for differing sample numbers and prevented sites with large numbers of samples \nfrom dominating the median concentration for the groundwater body.  The median \nPage 5 of 29 \n \n \nconcentration was used (in preference to the mean) to prevent occasional peaks in \nconcentration from skewing the results. \nRelationship with Land Cover \nHistorically, samples are collected from a range of monitoring sites (monitoring boreholes, \nabstraction sites, private boreholes, springs etc), so borehole capture zones were not generally \navailable.  Therefore, the predominant land cover for a 1 km radius around each monitoring \nsite, derived from a simplified CORINE2000 (Co-ordination of Information on the \nEnvironment) land cover class, was used.  The CORINE classes were re-categorised into the \nfollowing broad land cover groups - Urban\/industrial; Arable; Managed grassland; Semi-\nnatural vegetation and Woodland.  Overall, the distribution of sites by predominant land cover \nclass was 8% urban\/industrial; 27% arable; 53% grassland; 3 % semi-natural vegetation and \n9% woodland.  The distribution of the median groundwater P-data tends to be log-normal so \nthat the data were log-transformed.  The relationship between log-transformed median \ngroundwater-P concentration at each site and the predominant local land cover was then \nassessed, in the four countries, using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). \n \nResults \nLimits of detection \nFigure 2 shows the effect of these four LOD treatments on median P concentration for \ngroundwater bodies in England and Wales.  The calculated median groundwater concentration \nchanges markedly in a number of groundwater bodies depending on the treatment of samples \nbelow LOD.  It is apparent, therefore, that the utility of datasets which have a large proportion \nof samples below LOD will be limited, particularly when the LOD itself is above an \necologically relevant threshold.  Since a very high fraction (94%) of the data from Northern \nIreland is below LOD, these data have been largely excluded from further analysis.  For all \nsubsequent analyses and reporting, samples below LOD were treated as being half the LOD, \nin line with assumptions made by other workers for statistical analyses (Shand et al., 2007; \nReimann et al., 2005). \n \nData coverage \nSignificant areas of the countries studied here have no historical groundwater P data.  In \nEngland and Wales 14% of groundwater bodies by area (or 112 out of 357 groundwater \nbodies) have no groundwater P observations.  In the Republic of Ireland this figure is 37% (or \n567 of the country\u2018s 746 groundwater bodies) and in Scotland it is 49% (or 241 out of 343 \ngroundwater bodies). \nPage 6 of 29 \n \nFigure 3 shows the cumulative frequency distribution of groundwater monitoring sites within \nthose groundwater bodies with some groundwater P data.  It is apparent that the number of \nsites in each groundwater body is generally limited, and a significant proportion of \ngroundwater bodies in all countries have fewer than 3 monitoring sites with groundwater P \ndata. \n \nTemporal results \nThe sampling times in England and Wales and Scotland are evenly distributed through the \nyear, but there are biases in the sampling in the Republic of Ireland (Figure 4), where less \nthan 2% of samples were collected between April and July, inclusive, which coincides with \nthe period of greatest in-stream biological demand for P.  However, taking all of the samples \nfrom England and Wales, Scotland and Ireland, there appears to be a uniform distribution in \nthe timing of peak observed concentration (Figure 5) with no evidence, for example, of high \nobserved concentrations at the onset of the recharge period.   \nThe national time series of annual median groundwater-P concentration (Figure 6) show no \nsignificant trend for Ireland and Scotland, but the data for England and Wales show an \napparent increase in annual median groundwater-P concentration up until 1987 followed by a \nprogressive decrease.  However, this reflects the smaller number of samples within the first \nhalf of the period (average number of samples per year up to 1987 was 277 compared to 1848 \nper year after 1987, a significant increase as shown by Students t=7.2, p<0.001) and the \nprogressively reducing LOD (from usually around 50 to 20 \u03bcg P L-1). \n \nSpatial results \nFigure 7 shows the spatial distribution of median groundwater P concentration within the \nsampled groundwater bodies of the four countries (excluding Northern Ireland).   \nRepublic of Ireland \nIn the Republic of Ireland, the majority of groundwater bodies have median P < 20 \u03bcg P L-1 \n(the national background level), which is consistent with the usual extremely low (< 10 \u03bcg P \nL\n-1\n SRP) surface water P concentrations due to the widespread dominance of limestone \ngeology and associated co-precipitation of P with calcite.   However, in 51 groundwater \nbodies (covering 22% of the Republic of Ireland - or 36 % of the area of groundwater bodies \nwith data) the median concentration exceeded 20 \u03bcg P L-1, suggesting potential anthropogenic \nimpact in these systems.  Thirty two groundwater bodies (28 % of the area) in the mid-west, \ntogether with more localised groundwater bodies in the east and south (Figure 7) have median \nconcentrations above the national eutrophication threshold of 30 \u00b5g P L\n-1\n.  These results are \nbroadly consistent with the analysis of Kilroy (2001) who reported, using national data from \n1995-97, that groundwater P levels were generally low with a national median value of 17 \u00b5g \nPage 7 of 29 \n \n \nP L\n-1\n of unfiltered molybdate reactive P, but that one quarter of the data were higher than 30 \n\u00b5g P L\n-1\n.  However, Kilroy (2001) suggested that sites with elevated groundwater P \nconcentrations were generally located in the eastern half of the country.  This is not apparent \nin Figure 7.   \nEngland and Wales \nIn England and Wales, median groundwater P concentrations tend to be relatively high \ncompared with the other countries, although large areas have median P concentrations of less \nthan 30 \u00b5g P L\n-1\n.  A number of groundwater bodies have median concentrations > 50 \u00b5g P L\n-1\n \n\u2013 mainly in the south eastern half of England, but with a notable cluster of high \nconcentrations in the English northwest.  Around 9 %, 5% and 1% of area of groundwater \nbodies with data exceed the three good ecological status river thresholds (UKTAG, 2007) of \n40, 50 and 120 \u03bcg P L-1, respectively.   \nScotland \nIn Scotland, data on groundwater P concentrations are available for relatively few \ngroundwater bodies.  Most of the monitored groundwater bodies have median P \nconcentrations of less than 20 \u00b5g P L\n-1\n, but a small number have concentrations above 30 \u00b5g \nP L\n-1\n.  These are generally found in the east of the country, which is drier and has more \nintensive agriculture than the west and north, although there are clusters in Caithness (in the \nnorth east) and in Dumfries and Galloway (in the south west).   \n \nRelationships with CORINE2000 Land Cover \nThe relationship between the predominant CORINE2000 land cover surrounding monitoring \nsites and mean groundwater-P concentration is shown in Table 2 for England and Wales, \nScotland and the Republic of Ireland.  There are many more groundwater-P measurements \navailable for England and Wales than for the other monitored areas.   \nLand-use classes account for only around 15% of the observed variability in groundwater-P \nconcentration across the 4 countries.  The ANOVA and Fisher LSD tests showed that: \nThe observed groundwater-P concentrations are significantly higher in England and Wales, \nthan those in the Republic of Ireland and Scotland, within each of the land-use classes.(Table \n2). \nMeasured groundwater-P concentrations are significantly lower where the predominant land-\nuse class surrounding monitoring boreholes is semi-natural vegetation than those with urban, \narable and grassland surrounding the boreholes, for England and Wales and Scotland but not \nthe Republic of Ireland (Table 2 and 3). \nPage 8 of 29 \n \n \nDiscussion \nThe quantity and quality of groundwater monitoring data for P is variable both within, and \nbetween, countries.  The constraints of poorly-designed monitoring schedules, at least for the \npurposes of evaluating groundwater P levels, inappropriate and variable LODs, and a lack of \ninformation about borehole capture zones hinder a more detailed interpretation of the data.  \nNevertheless, many of the results generated are interesting and challenge previous \nperceptions.  In particular, the data suggest that phosphorus concentrations in many \ngroundwater bodies in Scotland, the Republic of Ireland and, particularly, in England and \nWales are relatively high (often > LOD and sometimes > ecological thresholds for surface \nwaters).  Further investigation is therefore warranted to answer three key questions: \nWhat is the nature and contribution of anthropogenic sources to high observed groundwater P \nconcentrations? \nWhat pathway and receptor factors influence the eutrophication risks from groundwater P to \nassociated freshwaters and groundwater-dependent terrestrial ecosystems? \nHow can the sources, behaviour and impacts of groundwater P be better characterised, \nunderstood and, if necessary, managed? \nNature and contribution of anthropogenic sources \nFor the purpose of designing appropriate policy responses, it is necessary to ascertain whether \ngroundwater P concentrations are elevated above natural background levels (i.e. the \nconcentrations which would be expected given undisturbed conditions).  However, defining a \nbaseline concentration at any scale (groundwater body, aquifer, or nationally) is not \nstraightforward.  One approach is to use a particular percentile concentration from \ngroundwater monitoring data, based on the assumption that only a small fraction of sites will \nbe strongly influenced by anthropogenic activity (Shand et al., 2007).  For example, the \nNatural Background Level for orthophosphate in all Irish groundwaters was set at 20 \u00b5g P L\n-1\n \nbased on the 90\nth\n percentile concentration within confined portions of Irish aquifers, thus \nexcluding samples representative of shallow bedrock flow and \u2015to minimise the risk of \ninfluence from anthropogenic inputs\u2016 (O\u2018Callaghan Moran & Associates, 2007).  In contrast, \nthe 95\nth\n percentile concentration was used by Edmunds et al. (1997) and is still used to set \nbackground levels for individual groundwater bodies or aquifers in England and Wales (Rob \nWard, pers. comm).   \nAlthough pragmatic, the main problem with such approaches is that they do not identify a \nnatural background concentration if a high proportion of the aquifers being assessed are \nalready polluted by anthropogenic sources.  In any case, account should be taken of the \nnumber and quality of the monitoring data used, including the consistency of successive \nmeasurements, the LODs used, number of samples above and below LODs, and the \ndistribution of concentrations above the LOD.  In addition, account should be taken of the \nPage 9 of 29 \n \n \nhydrogeological context of systems under consideration, including the potential evolution of \ngeochemistry along hydrogeological flow paths.   \nOur ANOVA showed that there were significant differences between P concentrations under \ndifferent land uses, suggesting some role for local land use in controlling groundwater P \nconcentrations.  The data presented in Tables 2 and 3 suggest that higher concentrations are \ngenerally found under urban, arable and managed grassland areas, particularly in England and \nWales.  This implies some anthropogenic influence, although interpretation is hampered by \nthe design of the sampling network, the timing of sampling, the length of the data series and \nby the fact that we only assessed land use in an arbitrary area with a 1 km radius around each \nmonitoring site, in the absence of information on the extent of source protection zones or \nabstraction rates.   \nA number of potential anthropogenic point- and diffuse-sources exist, which could lead to \nenhanced groundwater P loading and explain, in part, the apparent elevation of concentrations \nunder urban and agricultural areas.  These include: \nAgricultural soils:  Phosphorus has been routinely applied to soils for many years, either as \nmineral fertilizer or as animal feed supplements, in excess of crop requirements in England \n(e.g. Withers et al., 2001), Northern Ireland (e.g. Foy et al., 1995) and in the Republic of \nIreland (e.g. Tunney, 1990).  This has led to the accumulation of P in soils and an increased \nrisk of leaching loss (e.g. Foy et al., 1995; Tunney, 1990; Heckrath et al., 1995; Sharpley, \n1995). \nSeptic tanks:  Many rural domestic dwellings are served by on-site wastewater treatment \nsystems, such as septic tanks.  In Ireland, for example, the domestic wastewater of over \n400,000 dwellings (>one-third of the population) is treated by on-site systems (Department of \nthe Environment, 2004).  Dissolved P concentrations in septic effluents can be as high as 12 \nmg P L\n-1\n (Weiskel and Howes, 1992; Gill et al., 2007).   \nLeaking sewers:  Raw sewage can have total phosphorus concentrations of 9 to 15 mg P L\n-1\n, \nof which two-thirds is in inorganic forms (Metcalf and Eddy. 2003).  If sewers leak, they can \ngenerate P-rich plumes which could pollute local groundwater. \nLeaking mains water pipes:  Around 95% of the UK\u2018s public water supplies are dosed with \northophosphate, to reduce plumbosolvency, at concentrations of 0.5 to 1.5 mg P L\n-1\n, \ndepending on alkalinity (CIWEM, 2005; Hayes et al., 2008), hence plumes of P-rich water \nmay also originate from leaking water mains.   \nSlurry lagoons:  Studies have shown clear evidence of P leaching and groundwater \ncontamination beneath animal slurry lagoons that lack impervious linings (e.g. Gooddy et al., \n1998; Withers et al., 1998).  Furness et al. (1991) have estimated that there were an estimated \n6150 slurry lagoons on dairy, beef and pig farms in the late 1980s.  Nicholson and Brewer \nPage 10 of 29 \n \n(1997) estimated a total surface area of 7.0 x 10\n6\n m\n2\n of livestock slurry and farm yard dirty \nwater stored in such lagoons. \nAgricultural manure heaps:  Nicholson and Brewer (1997) estimated that the exposed \nsurface area of stored animal manures was 11.9 x 10\n6\n m\n2\n, whilst Gooddy (2002) reported P \nleaching from a turkey litter site down to a depth of at least 5 m. \n \nInfluence of pathway and receptor type on eutrophication risks in associated freshwater and \ngroundwater-dependent terrestrial ecosystems  \nThe eutrophication risk to receptor systems due to elevated groundwater P concentrations will \nvary with hydrogeological setting (pathways) and the sensitivity of the receptor system to P.  \nEven if groundwater P concentrations are elevated above natural background levels, adverse \nimpacts will not necessarily be observed in receptor systems because a number of attenuating \nreactions may occur along the flowpath between monitoring site and receptor.  In addition, if \ngroundwater contamination is limited in extent, some dilution would be expected from \nuncontaminated baseflow.  Factors affecting the likelihood of groundwater P transport to \nreceptor systems include: \nThe sorption potential of the aquifer matrix for P.  This will be related to the combined \nFe(OH)3 and CaCO3 content.  There are a number of potential P sorption and immobilisation \nprocesses including relatively rapid adsorption at high-affinity mineral surface sites (Parfitt, \n1978, 1989), slower precipitation of metal phosphate complexes (Van Riemsdijk et al., 1984) \nand slow diffusion into micropores or aggregates (Torrent et al., 1992; Mikutta et al., 2006; \nLijklema, 1980; Stollenwerk, 1996).  Some of these processes are reversible and some are \ndependent on redox conditions (e.g. Griffioen, 2006; Loeb et al., 2008); \nThe degree of contact between groundwater and the aquifer matrix as indicated by the \nflow type.  This is likely to be relatively low in karstic\/highly fissured, fissure \/ fracture and \ndual porosity systems, where the matrix may be bypassed by most of the flow and higher \nwhere a significant fraction of flow is intergranular.  Studies considering P movement through \ngroundwater in which P sorption has been shown to be important (e.g Stollenwerk, 1996; \nHarman et al., 1996; Ptacek, 1998; Corbett et al., 2002) have mostly examined alluvial or \nintergranular aquifers, whereas groundwater P contamination has more commonly been \nassociated with fractured aquifers (e.g. Withers et al., 1998; Bishop et al., 1998);  \nThe time available for sorption.  This will depend upon the likely groundwater residence \ntime, which will depend on aquifer type, transmissivity, hydraulic gradients and typical length \nof groundwater flow path to the receptor; \nThe role of the hyporheic zone: Steep gradients in redox potential can exist in the transition \nzone between groundwater and surface water, with consequences for P mobility (e.g. \nGriffioen, 2006; Surridge et al., 2006). Under low redox potential iron-associated P may be \nmobilised, as Fe\n3+\n is reduced to Fe\n2+\n.  When redox potential increases (for example in the \nPage 11 of 29 \n \n \nhyporheic zone), P may be immobilised.  However, the significance of these processes for \nproviding natural attenuation (or otherwise) of nutrients is highly uncertain. \n \nReceptor sensitivity \nThe sensitivity of a river or wetland receptor to groundwater P inputs will depend on a \nnumber of factors associated with the receptor, and the timing and mode of P delivery.  These \nare summarised in Figure 8 and include: \nScale:  The variety of potential P sources for surface waters increases as the upstream \ncontributing area increases, as will hydrological damping and the role of in-stream retention \n(Prairie and Kalff, 1986), hindering the establishment of causal relationships between specific \nP sources and biological impacts (Edwards and Withers, 2007); \nReceptor residence time: The impact of different P inputs on the receptor ecosystem will \ndiffer considerably between lentic and lotic systems, because of their differing sensitivity to \nconcentration and load (Edwards et al., 2000).  The longer residence times of lentic systems \n(Johnes et al., 2007), compared with lotic systems, means that a significant fraction of \ndiffuse-source P inputs from winter and spring runoff events will remain (augmented by \ninternal nutrient cycling), thereby contributing to biological P demand in spring and summer \nand a reduced sensitivity to groundwater P.  By contrast, rivers and streams have much \nshorter residence times (Jarvie et al., 2006) so that baseflow P delivery in spring and summer \nis likely to be more important, whilst high episodic loads of soil-derived P in the winter are \nlikely to have less direct local significance for the ecosystem; \nFlow regime and climate: Groundwater flow is largely independent of individual \nprecipitation events (Edwards and Withers, 2007) and makes its most significant relative \ncontribution during periods of low flow, in both upland and lowland areas.  A river with a \nvery high base flow index (such as in a chalk catchment) in a relatively dry climate is likely to \nhave less sediment-derived P inputs because of the fewer runoff and erosion events and a \nhigher groundwater contribution to flow.  Depending on the N:P ratio of the groundwater \ncompared with that in the receiving surface water, groundwater discharge can also lead to a \nshift in the limiting nutrient for primary production, if it constitutes a significant fraction of \nthe total flow (Slomp and Van Cappellen, 2004).   \nSynchronicity between delivery and biological demand: Groundwater is most important \nfor supporting surface water flows during low-flow periods.  These periods (i.e. late spring \nand summer) are often contemporaneous with high in-stream biological demand for P (Flynn \net al., 2002; Foy, 2005).  For example, most lowland river macrophytes have committed their \nbiomass by June, having completed their growth and flowered, and generally seek to maintain \nbiomass during the rest of the growing season; \nPage 12 of 29 \n \nSensitivity of species:  Increases in P supply from groundwater could promote adverse \necological impacts such as the loss of low growing, stress tolerant sedges and herbs in \ngroundwater discharge fens (e.g. in calcareous spring fens) which are highly sensitive to \nprolonged periods of higher nutrient availability which favour more competitive and \nproductive species.  Currently, enhanced P supply is considered to be a far greater risk to the \nmaintenance of endangered plant species in European fens than nitrogen enrichment (Wassen \net al., 2005).  In rivers, elevated P supply is often associated with increased filamentous algal \ngrowth and associated changes in the structure and cover of aquatic vegetation (Hilton et al., \n2006).  Since rooted macrophytes derive their nutrient supply from both the water column and \nsediment interstices (Clarke and Wharton, 2001) they may be more sensitive to groundwater \nP inputs than might be deduced from surface water P concentrations alone, especially in \nbaseflow-dominated systems, such as chalk streams. It is also feasible that, in some situations, \nhigh groundwater P concentrations will frustrate attempts to promote ecological recovery in \nrivers via point-source control, even when these succeed in greatly reducing surface water P \nloading. \nSaturation thresholds: It is often considered that calcareous systems are protected against \nthe effects of enhanced P concentrations as the co-precipitation of P is an important process \nfor controlling P concentrations.  However, a receptor that exceeds or is close to the saturation \nthreshold will be sensitive to additional inputs of P through groundwater.  This may be \nparticularly important in chalk systems in which groundwater P enters the surface water body \nthrough discrete entry points (e.g. Howden and Burt, 2008, 2009) rather than diffuse inflow. \nRequirements to better characterise, understand and manage groundwater P \nDespite the many uncertainties, our analysis of existing available data from five countries \nsuggests that more attention should be paid to the potential role of groundwater as a source of \nP-delivery to surface water ecosystems and that it should not automatically be viewed as a \nsource of dilution.  Given the potential significance of elevated groundwater P for the \nachievement of Good Ecological Status required under the European Water Framework \nDirective (WFD: 2000\/60\/EC) in many surface water and wetland receptors, we propose the \nfollowing: \n1. Standardised sampling and analytical techniques to allow comparisons, particularly \nfor transnational water bodies:  Present data holdings across the five countries are inconsistent \nin several ways.  The particular form of P determined by water sample analyses differs \nbetween countries, regions and, in some cases, sampling events.  It is imperative that \nsampling strategies are applied consistently, such that comparisons may be made robustly;  \n2. Standardised LODs, at least at a national scale, which are below ecologically-\nimportant thresholds:  This is a key observation from our analyses.  Historically, the LODs for \ngroundwater-P were thought to be unimportant, as samples were being analysed for \ncomparison with drinking water standards and were often relatively high.  The progressive \nchanges in LOD in England and Wales over time have also rendered the data unsuitable for \ntrend analyses (Fig. 6); \nPage 13 of 29 \n \n \n3. Better-defined and robust sampling strategies (e.g. Burt et al., 2009) which capture the \nspatial and temporal variability in groundwater P concentration:  Past and present sampling \nstrategies are somewhat piece-meal, have limited spatial coverage at the national scale (Fig. \n7), and have low sampling frequency in space (Fig. 3) and time; \n4. Sampling of the many groundwater bodies with no historical measurements of P \nconcentration is required.  This should be prioritised according to estimated risk in associated \nreceptors:  Historically, sampling has been focused on aquifers where groundwater was \nabstracted for public water supply.  There are few data from other aquifer systems; \n5. An improved knowledge of the locations of point-sources such as slurry lagoons, \nseptic tanks and leaking water and waste water pipes is needed, along with a regulatory means \nof managing the risks that they may pose to groundwater P concentrations:  Source \nmanagement is key to reducing potential anthropogenic inputs of P to groundwater.  The \npresent lack of information about locations of sources should be addressed as a matter of \nurgency;    \n6. Further monitoring and research to better characterise the extent and magnitude of \nanthropogenic influences (relative to potential geological sources of phosphorus) on \ngroundwater P concentrations, the transformation and\/or storage of P along the aquifer-\nhyporheic zone flow path and the subsequent risk to receptors.  A more comprehensive \nunderstanding of phosphorus attenuation mechanisms along groundwater and hyporheic zone \nflow pathways is needed.   \n \nConclusions \nAn analysis of phosphate concentration in groundwater has been presented, based on over \n49,000 groundwater samples collected from almost 3600 monitoring sites by the national \nregulatory agencies for England and Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Republic of \nIreland over the period 1968 to 2007.  Notwithstanding the overall size of the dataset, the \nsignificance of the interpretations must be viewed in the context of the number of monitoring \nsites within each groundwater body (often <=3) and the large number of samples (over \n24,000) below LOD (which were variable and often at or above ecologically-relevant \nthresholds).  Many groundwater bodies covering extensive areas, especially in the Republic of \nIreland and Scotland, have no data on P concentrations.  Others have few sampling sites \nand\/or small numbers of samples.   That said, significant numbers of groundwater bodies have \nmedian groundwater P concentrations which are above ecologically significant thresholds for \nreceiving freshwaters.   \nThe potential ecological risk of high observed groundwater P concentrations for receptor \nsystems will depend on whether concentrations are above the natural background level, the \npotential for removal along flow pathways, the sensitivity of the receptor to P and the \nPage 14 of 29 \n \nimportance of other P sources.  Given the important role of phosphorus for achieving Good \nEcological Status in surface waters under the WFD, this research suggests that groundwater \nshould not automatically be viewed as a source of dilution, but rather as having the potential \nto trigger and\/or maintain eutrophication.   Further research is needed to better characterise \nthe extent and magnitude of anthropogenic P sources (relative to potential geological sources) \nand the transformation and\/or retention of P along the aquifer-hyporheic zone flowpath, in \norder to quantify any risks posed to receptors. \n \nAcknowledgments \nThe authors are grateful to the Scotland & Northern Ireland Forum for Environmental \nResearch (SNIFFER Project WFD 85) for funding and to the Environment Agency of \nEngland and Wales, SEPA, EHS Northern Ireland and the Irish EPA for the provision of data.  \nWe thank the members of the WFD85 Steering Committee for their advice and support. \nWe are also grateful to two anonymous referees whose insightful comments did much to \nimprove our original manuscript.  \nReferences \nAddiscott TM, Thomas D.
