INTRODUCTION \nFor a wave energy converter (WEC) to be economic it \nmust be small but powerful: it must have a high output \nper expensive ton [1].  Successive devices devised and \ninvestigated at Lancaster University and elsewhere have \nhad this clear aim.  [1,2,4,5,6,20]  The Cost term in \nassessing any of these concepts must be the lifetime cost \nper unit of energy delivered ( e.g. in p\/kWh )  and this \nimplies an imperative for survival in the worst storms and \na minimum of on-site maintenance. \n \nPitching-surge Collectors hinged at or near the seabed \nwere proposed in 1998 [6] and have since been developed \nat QUB, Lancaster and elsewhere for near-shore \nconditions [5,7]. \n \nIt has been widely believed in the wave power \ncommunity that, to be economic, devices must be \noffshore in deep water where average energy levels are \nhighest [1,10].  However, much of this energy comes in \nstorms in amounts that no device could capture.  It seems \nnow that the converse may be true:  that the steadily \ndecreasing water depths (e.g. West of the Hebrides) will \nact to protect near-shore devices from extreme forces and, \noverall, make them a rational economic choice [8] \n \nPoint absorbers (PA) first described and investigated \nby Budal & Falnes [9] are likely to have the least cost but \nheaving types proved difficult to engineer and their likely \nsurvival in storms is questionable.  Evans [3] showed that \na PA moving in surge has an ideal power twice that of a \nheaving PA and that :- \n \n PA capture width (Heave) =  \u0002\/2\u0003 \n PA      \u201c         \u201c     (Surge)  = \u0002\/\u0003 \n \nA means of calculating ideal power and amplitude of a \nparticular PA collector is given by Evans [3,11] and \ninvestigated by Folley [ 4 ] :- \n   \nPo = Q2 \/ 8B \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026  (1) \nxo =  Q \/ 2B\u0004 \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026  (2) \n \nwhere  Q = Total wave force on the collector, N \nB = Radiation coeff of the collector, Ns\/m \n\u0004 = Wave frequency, rad\/s \n \nFor example, a typical (model) collector body of area \n20 x 20 cm and 4 cm thick with fully radiused edges in \nwaves with 1.2 cm amplitude would have Q = 2.8N, B = \n4 Ns\/m and xo = 0.054m based on values obtained using \nWAMIT [12].  At full scale xo scales to 5.4 m so the \nplate-like collector\u2019s velocity would peak at 3 m\/s normal \nto its face. Clearly this would result in large drag forces \nacting on the collector and a reduction in the net (output) \npower. \nPreliminary experiments, with a range of collector \nshapes that were guided to translate horizontally in the \nsurge direction and made resonant with the waves using \nsprings, showed that the above is essentially true and \ncollector amplitudes of up to 6 x wave amplitude were \nobserved [13].  It was noted that, when power was being \nextracted at these large amplitudes, the wave amplitude \nahead of the collect was locally amplified and was much \ngreater that in the lee of the collector where the water \nsurface remained almost flat.  This served to demonstrate \nthe physical reality of the PA effect in surge and to \nvalidate the equations above.  Questions remained about \nthe nature of the drag forces, possibly, in part, answered \nby Ridjanovic [14] but one thing was clear, the resonant \nmass would be very large. \n \nAdded Mass, Ma = 6.05 kg for 20 x 20 x 4 cm plate \nmentioned above moving at 6 rad\/s \nBody Mass, Mb =0.32kg, assuming \u201cship-like\u201d density \nof 200 kg\/m3 \n    \nM = Ma + Mb   = 6.37     kg   at 1\/100 scale \nAn Investigation into Power from Pitch-Surge \nPoint-Absorber Wave Energy Converters  \nRobert V.

This paper gives preliminary results for \n\u201cWRASPA\u201d, a WEC intended for deeper waters 20-50 m \nfound further offshore.   \nAlthough the devices are similar in operation the \nhydrodynamic conditions they will face in reality are \nlikely to be very different in terms e.g. of breaking wave \nforces and shoaling effects. \n \n \nFig. 1. Model and tank \u2013 general arrangement \nII. THE CONCEPT DEVICE, WRASPA* \n(* Wave-driven Resonant Arcuate-action Surging \nPoint Absorber) \nUntil laboratory tests and digital modelling have \nshown the best form of the device [16] we are uncertain \nas to its engineering details.  Currently we envisage a \nself-contained machine weighing about 500 t without \nballast and over 1000 t when ballasted and on-site, see \nFig 2.  The collector and arm would be driven to and fro \nby wave forces.  The arm would drive 3 or more \nhydraulic rams, attached to the base unit.  Housed in the \nbase unit a power conversion system containing an \nenergy store would adapt to differing wave forces and \ndeliver steady power to an on-board electrical generator. \nDeployment and recovery would be by crane from a \nsuitable service vessel with the base unit being inserted \ninto the top of a tubular seabed pile.  The whole device \nwould be ballasted at or near the pivot to float at the \ndepth shown and would be actively controlled to face the \nprevailing energy direction at all times. \n \n \nFig.2 Initial concept \n \n \nFig. 3.  Apparatus in tank \u2013 covers removed from seabed hatch to show \npile.  \nIII. APPARATUS \nA. The Tank \nFig 3 (above) is a diagram of the apparatus used.  The \n\u201craised seabed\u201d was formed from a set of 4 large  tables \nand a ramp that forced waves generated by the ED \nwavemakers [17] into water some 65 % shallower and the \n3 m length of shallower (30 cm deep) water allowed the \nwave to stabilise before reaching the model. \nIn long-period, long-crested, non-breaking waves the \namplitudes decreased as they passed down the tank as \nshown (Fig.4). However, the same fig also shows that \nshorter period waves are less affected by shallow water \nand appear to lose very little energy. The shape, of longer \nperiod waves in particular, became more trochoidal as \nthey moved down the tank e.g. see Fig 5. \nThere was concern that the standing wave ratio might \nbe adversely affected by the ramp and tables   but Fig 6 \nshows, in the frequency range of interest, a SWR less \nthan 15% (implying reflected energy <2.5%) i.e. that the \nbeach, based on proven ideas from Edinburgh University \n[18] works well and for tests at 1\/100 scale the \nshallowing of the tank presents no problems. \nBreaking waves, however, are a problem in near-shore \nsites and have proved fatal for at least one pilot scale \nWEC [19].  At larger wavemaker amplitudes in the now \n521\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library. Downloaded on June 23,2010 at 14:31:59 UTC from IEEE Xplore.

Again the 3 m \u201clead-in\u201d to \nthe model served to give reasonably realistic \n\u201ccontinental-shelf\u201d test conditions in extreme seas. \n \n \n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50 70 90 110 130 150 170 190 210 230 250\nDistance along tank, cm\nW\nav\ne \nam\npl\nitu\nde\n, m\nm\nFreq. 0.67 Hz\nFreq. 0.91 Hz\nFreq. 1 Hz\n \nFig. 4.

The Model  \nThe collector, 10 cm thick x 10 cm radius, was \nimmersed to a depth of 10 cm, with 5 cm freeboard and \nweighed 140gm, dry, giving it a density of 90 kg\/m3.  Its \nposition on the arm is adjustable but for these tests the \nwaterline was set at 250 mm from the pivot.  The arm \nwas strain-gauged at 55 and 111 mm from the pivot and \nwas calibrated with known weights to give :- \n \nM1  =  k1 V1  and M2  =  k2 V2   \n   \nWhere:-Vn  = logged volts \nMn = moment Nm (measured at the s.gauge) \nkn  = factor Nmm\/V \n \nfrom these it was possible to calculate :- \nF  = (M1-M2)\/0.056    \nZ = (M1 +.055F)\/F \nWhere: F = total force acting,  N and Z = effective \ndistance of F from pivot, mm \n \nThe motion of the arm was geared up by 4.374 and \nmeasured using a 10-turn precision potentiometer. \nWhen measuring power the geared-up shaft was acted \non by 3 electrically operated clutches each connected to a \nsmall band-brake.  These were loaded with hanging \nweights of (say) 100, 200 and 400 grammes such that \nswitching the brakes on in different combinations gave 8 \nlevels of torque.  (The shaft could also be connected by \nanother clutch to a pancake motor but this was not used in \nthese experiments). \nThe arm was carried on a shaft running in small \nstainless steel ball races mounted in the top of an \nadjustable height \u201cpile\u201d that stood on the tank floor, held \ndown by large brass weights.  A strain-gauge bridge at \nthe lower end of the pile measured horizontal forces at \nthe pivot. Twelve wave gauges were arranged to measure \nthe oncoming wave and local waves ahead, astern and \nabeam of the model and in all, 16 \u201cchannels\u201d of data were \nrecorded using a Labview\u00a9 program. \n \n \n \n522\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

Resonance sweep \nWith all brakes switched off the only applied damping \nwas the small amount of friction in the bearings in the \npivot and driven shafts.  In this state sine waves of \nsteadily increasing frequency were passed down the tank \nand an \u201cenvelope\u201d of collector motion amplitudes was \nobtained. \nB. Power \nSteady-state waves at about the resonant frequency \nwere run past the model while brake loads were increased \nfrom zero to a maximum in load steps lasting for 30 sec. \nC. Mixed Seas \nAlthough fixed-load braking is not the intended final \ncontrol method a series of initial tests with an \n\u201cintermediate\u201d load were carried out in Bretchsneider \nseas [17] of differing energy levels and with time periods \nclose to the resonant frequency of the model. \nD. Extreme wave loading \nFor these trials the drive cord was removed so the arm \nwas unimpeded in its motion.  The motions recorded \nwere obtained from video recordings by comparing \nobserved motions with fixed markers ahead and astern of \nthe model. \nV. RESULTS \nA. Resonance \nResults of the resonance sweep are seen in Fig.8 and \nshow that the frequency response is fairly flat.  If the \nmodel\u2019s resonant frequency was at the scaled centre of an \nannual spectrum of Atlantic waves the diminution in \namplitude at each end of the spectrum (T = 8s to T = 12s \nnominally) might be as little as    30 %. \nB. Regular-wave power \nFrom the above sweep test a peak frequency of \n0.805Hz was chosen and used in all power tests. For each \nwave-size brake loads were varied in steps and Fig. 9 \nshows examples of work loops each recorded at the mid-\npoint of a 30second load-step.  The loops are drawn \nclockwise so at times when motion is +ve, force is +ve \nand v.v.  Thus the area inside the loop indicates work \ndone in 1 cycle. \n \nA = T \u0005  A = area, J \n   T = p-p torque at pivot, Nm \n   \u0005 = p-p motion, rad \n \nPower then is  P = A\u0004 , W   \nWhere \u0004 = frequency  Hz. \n \nBy plotting torque vs amplitude, see e.g. the lowest \ncurve in Fig.10, it can be seen they are in an inverse, \nprobably linear, relationship and that the x = 0 and x max \nintercepts respectively represent the \u201clocked\u201d and \u201cfree\u201d \nlimits in each condition. \nIt follows that the power curve is parabolic with a peak \nat an amplitude of x max\/2 and zeroes at 0,0 and xmax,0, see \nalso Fig.10. The same fig. also shows the derived \nparabola of Capture Width (captured power, kW\/incident \nwave power, kW\/m)  \nTaking peak values from these curves for each of the \nregular wave sizes studied gives the variation of device \npower vs incident wave power plotted in Fig. 11.  The \nbest-fit line appears to intercept the y axis at a positive \nvalue suggesting that collector \u201cefficiency\u201d improves in \nsmaller waves.  Thus, capture widths (CW) plotted in the \nsame figure show a marked increase at smaller \namplitudes to possibly 8 m or more in waves of less than \n100 kw\/m. \n \n-1.5\n-1\n-0.5\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140\nTime, s\nAm\npl\nitu\nde\n o\nf c\nol\nle\nct\nor\n \nFig. 8.

Collector Power vs wave power \n \nC. Power in Mixed Seas \nAs described above tests were carried out with a fixed, \n\u201cintermediate\u201d level of brake loading.  The brakes exert a \ndry, or Coulomb, friction load, closely modelling the load \nthat would be applied by a fixed pressure, fixed area \nhydraulic system at full scale and not the intended, \nintelligently controlled, system. \nFig.12 shows a 50 sec wave record at one gauge and \nfig 13 shows the resulting wave and collector powers. \nThe average scaled-up device power from these results is \n1.56 MW from a sea with 830 kW\/m incident power. \nThis is some 2.75x lower than device power in regular \nwaves of the same incident power in these experiments. \n \n-30\n-20\n-10\n0\n10\n20\n30\n0 10 20 30 40 50\nElapsed time, s\nS\nur\nfa\nce\n e\nle\nva\ntio\nn,\n \nm\nm\n \nFig. 12.

Forces \nappear quite small and increase with increasing wave \namplitude. The arm moves to natural angles determined \nby wave and buoyancy forces.  A few readings were \ntaken from video records and these showed that in large, \nnon-breaking waves the motion amplitudes peaked at 270 \n230 and 200 in waves of 0.625, 0.91 and 1 Hz \nrespectively. In going from non-breaking to breaking \nwaves the collector amplitude decreased noticeably, e.g. \nfrom 20 to 140 at 1 Hz. In breakers the collector\u2019s motion \nwas biased \u201clandwards\u201d and the motion was non-\nsinusoidal. \nBehaviour and forces in extreme conditions will \nrequire further study but these results suggest that storm \nsurvival will not be a problem and that peak structural \nforces will be acceptably low. \n \n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60\nwave ampl., mm\nPi\nvo\nt f\nor\nce\n a\nm\npl\n.

These preliminary tests show that WRASPA is a \nviable concept. \n \n2. In its present form, at full scale, it could have a \ncapture width of in excess of 8 metres in waves less \nthan 100 kw\/m. \n \n \n \n \n524\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

In larger waves capture width decreases but wave \npower will be limited in any case by its installed \npower handling capacity. \n \n4. Further tests in small waves should be conducted \nwith the collector position and shape altered  to give \nresonance at, or slightly higher than, 1 Hz. \n(equivalent to 10 sec at full scale) \n \n5. Collectors of different shapes should be tested to \nincrease power e.g. by reducing drag. \n \n6. These initial tests show that further work on control \nmethods is vital as are comprehensive measurements \nand modelling of such devices in extreme seas in \ntheir likely marine situations. \n \n7. The Lancaster wave tank worked well but to model \nN W Atlantic \/ Continental Shelf conditions it may \nbe necessary to extend the length of the tank or test \nat a smaller scale when testing in extreme seas. \n \n8. As device development progresses testing in mixed \nand directionally spread seas will become important \nand for this we will approach Edinburgh University. \nREFERENCES \n[1] French, M and Bracewell, R, The systematic design of \neconomic wave energy converters 5th International \nOffshore and Polar Engineering Conference, The Hague, \nJune 11-16, 1995 \n[2] Carter, R G and Hurdle, D P, Wave energy absorption by a \nsmall body moving in surge.
