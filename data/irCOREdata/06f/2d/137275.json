It is the purpose \nof this paper to gather the opinion of all the airlines, belonging to the four global \nalliance groupings on the impact alliances have had on their traffic and on their \nperformance in general. To achieve this, a comprehensive survey of the alliance \nmanagement departments of airlines participating in the four global strategic alliances \nwas carried out.

Their responses have been analysed \nunder each global alliances grouping, under airline and under geographic region to \nestablish which group, type of carrier and geographic region has benefited most. The \nresults show that each of the four global alliances groupings has experienced different \nresults according to the type of collaboration agreed amongst their member airlines. \n \nKeywords: Airline Alliances, Passenger traffic \n \n \n \n \n1.0 Introduction \n 2\n \nAlliances are generally a strategy that companies use when acquiring or internal \ndevelopment as means of growing is not an option.  Sometimes even if internal \ndevelopment is possible, alliances are preferable as it provides quicker access to new \nmarkets.  Alliances vary in degree of commitment from simple marketing cooperation \nto just short of complete mergers or acquisitions.  Globally, mergers and acquisition \ndeals exceeded $2,000 billions in 1999-2000 indicating, companies increasingly \nembark on partnerships to achieve their expansion goals and develop a world-class \ncapability.  According to Harbison and Pekar (1999) survey, in 1997-1999 alone more \nthan 20,000 alliances have been formed worldwide and, interestingly, more than half \nof them are between competitors. \n \nIn this respect, airline industry is not an exception. There has clearly been a surge in \nformation of alliances amongst airlines in recent years. A large number of airlines \nhave established or joined one of the four global airline alliances: \u201c Wings\u201d (1989)1, \nStar Alliance (1997), oneworld (1998), SkyTeam (2000) \u2013 and they now control as \nallied partners 56% of world Revenue Passenger Kilometers (Airline Business, \nSeptember 2002). See appendix A for the description of each alliances groupings and \ntheir memberships.   \n \nIATA  (2001) defines an \u201cairline alliance\u201d as follows: three or more airlines \nparticipating in commercial relationship or joint venture, where (i) a joint and \ncommonly identifiable product is marketed under a single commercial name or brand; \nand (ii) this commercial name or brand is promoted to the public through the airlines \nparticipating in the alliance and its agents; and (iii) the commercial name or brand is \nused to identify the alliance services at airports and other service delivery points in \nsituations where bilateral agreements exist, e.g. code share agreement. \n \nAccording to another definition \u201cA strategic airline alliance is a long term partnership \nof two or more firms who attempt to enhance advantages collectively vis-\u00e0-vis their \ncompetitors by sharing scarce resources including brand assets and market access \ncapability, enhancing service quality, and thereby improving profitability\u2026a strategic \nalliance is one involving strategic commitment by top management to link up a \nsubstantial part of their respective route networks as well as collaborating on some \nkey areas of airline business.\u201d \n \n                                                 \n1 Date of alliance formation \n 3\nThe majority of airlines are interested to extend their network beyond the markets \nthey currently serve.  However, due to regulatory restrictions on market access, \nownership and control, they have been pushed towards the formation of strategic \nalliance groupings. Legislation aimed at protecting national interests has meant that it \nis virtually impossible to acquire a controlling interest in airlines in countries or \ntrading blocks outside those in which an airline is owned and operated. For example, a \nnon-US airline can only have up to a maximum of 25% of voting share in any US \ncarrier.  A non-EU carrier can purchase up to a maximum of 49% of a EU carrier.   To \ngrow naturally is also subject to restrictions such as the limitations in growing in \nhome markets, or lack of regulatory approval to access foreign markets, or lack of \nslots at airports to which the airline wants to operate. In addition to expanding their \nnetwork airlines aim at improve revenues, reduce costs and increase customer \nbenefits. \n \nAs a result, as discussed above, in the last decade a number of  alliance groupings \nhave emerged. Given such a dynamics in the airline industry and the current crisis due \nto slow down in the economy and 11th September it was of interest to assess the \nfollowings: \n \n\u2022 How do airlines perceive the impact of alliances on their operation in general \nand on passenger traffic in particular? \n\u2022 How different types of partnership agreements have affected the results? \n\u2022 Have airlines of different size, operating from different region and belonging \nto different alliance grouping been affected differently. \n \n \n2.0 Assessing the perception of airlines about their alliances impact \n \nTo address the above questions, a comprehensive survey of the alliance management \ndepartments of airlines participating in the four global strategic alliances were carried \nout in 2002.   \n \nThe heads of the alliance departments of all airlines \u2013 that is 28 carriers at the time \nthis survey \u2013 belonging to the alliance groupings of Star Alliance, \u201cWings\u201d, oneworld \nand SkyTeam were contacted to participate in a questionnaire survey. The \nquestionnaire focused on the impact of the alliances on airlines\u2019 operation as \nperceived by the heads of the alliance department. All 28 carriers participated in the \nresearch giving the survey a 100% response rate. \n \n 4\nSpecial emphasis was given to the impact of alliances on passenger traffic, which is \none of the most important factors airlines themselves and airline specialists use to \ndetermine airline and alliance performance.  In assessing the impact of alliances on \npassenger traffic the following criteria were taken into account: \n \n\u2022 The type of cooperation amongst the carriers themselves (FFP, Code Share, \nStrategic Alliance with or without antitrust immunity),  \n\u2022 The type of route (hub-hub, hub-non hub, non hub-non hub)  \n\u2022 The global alliance groupings (Wings\u201d, Star Alliance, oneworld and SkyTeam) \n\u2022 The size of carriers measured by their annual output (Available Tonne Kilometers-\nASK) \n\u2022 The region where the carriers come from (North America, Europe, Asia, Central \nand South America). \n \nThis was to establish which type of cooperation, route, alliances groupings, carrier \nsize and geographical region has benefited most, in terms of passenger traffic, as a \nresult of the formation of alliances. \n \nAs the questionnaire survey presented a unique opportunity to collect inside \ninformation about the impact of airline alliances, the scope of the questions was \nextended to cover some other specific areas of airline operations that alliances may \naffect, such as load factors, traffic, revenue, costs and fares. These parameters were \nchosen since they constitute the measures airlines use to evaluate their performance \nand thus any carrier entering into an alliance expects to improve such measures. \nFurthermore, some questions were included to examine whether there has been \nsatisfaction from the participation in the alliance, the degree of satisfaction arising \nfrom the participation in the alliances and how fast the impact of alliance on their \noperation has become evident.  \n \n \n3.0 The general impact of alliances on airlines operation \n \nThe findings of survey revealed that one of the key reasons for airlines decision to \nparticipate in an alliance has been a defensive move as they expressed the opinion that \nif an airline remained unaligned, it would be worse off losing traffic to other airlines \nin alliance groupings. They are also of the opinion that the alliance relationship is \nvery complex and still developing.  \n \nIn general the accession and participation in the alliances is considered successful. \nWhile one third of participants rate their alliance coooperation as \u201cexcellent, the rest \nbelieve that the course and operation of the alliances has been so far \u201cgood\u201d.   A \n 5\nnumber of European regional carriers expressed some reservations and preferred to \ntake a neutral stance.  \n \nAlmost all participants believe that joining the alliances grouping has led to an \nincrease in traffic, load factor and revenue.  While two thirds of participants expressed \nthe opinion that fares have not been influenced the rest declared that fares on routes \noperated jointly by partners have increased. A large proportion of participating \nairlines affirms that costs have registered some reduction. \n \nFigure 1: Impact of airline alliances  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTo establish the degree of the impact of alliances on airlines\u2019 operation, the \nrespondents were asked to rate the impact from 1 to 5, 1 referring to\u201d no \nimpact\u201d and  5 to \u201csignificant impact\u201d.   It can be seen from figure 2 that the \nmost pronounced effects have been experienced in the area of passenger traffic.  \nNext in ranking are revenue and loaf factor.  The least pronounced impacts have \nbeen observed in the areas of costs and fares.  As far as costs are concerned, not \nonly airlines have not reaped much benefit from their alliance participation but \nhave entail certain substantial initial expenses such as IT system harmonization, \nmarketing and advertising expenses which could put a serious strain, at least \nshort term, on the airline costs.  A significant long-term cost \nreductions\/synergies require the alignment of some product specifications, \ncommon approach, common fleet planning and require not only some time and \na high degree of integration but also a major commitment on the part of the \nallies \n \n \n0%\n20%\n40%\n60%\n80%\n100%\n120%\nTraffic\nincrease\nLoad factor\nincrease\nRevenue\nincrease\nFare\nincrease\nCost\nreduction\n%\n o\nf r\nes\npo\nnd\nen\nts\n 6\nFigure 2: The degree of alliance impact on airline operation \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe response on fare increases indicates that the reduction in competition due to \nairline alliances has not led to acute monopolistic situations \u2013 as regulators would \nhave acted to prevent such a development. However, what remains rather alarming is \nthe fact that the carriers that take the contrary opinion and claim that there has been an \nincrease in fares amounting to even 10% are amongst the major players in the existing \nalliances on both sides of the Atlantic. Such fare increases may be related more to the \npolicy an airline follows to deal with decreased profitability than to monopolistic \nsituation. Each airline however, follows the policy that it sees fit even if it contradicts \nthe policy followed by its partners. Lufthansa\u2019s strategy after September 2001 was to \ncut capacity and maintain fare discipline whereas United Airlines\u2019 strategy was to cut \nfares. The dispute between the partners ended up with the German government \ncomplaining to the US government. United\u2019s choice of policy proved to be rather \nquestionable given that they filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 (Airline \nbusiness\u2026.). \n \n \n4.0 Impact of airline alliances on passenger traffic \n \nAs mentioned in the above section airlines have most benefited from participation in \nairline alliances in the form of increase in traffic.  Almost 90% of respondents \nclaimed that they experienced an increase in traffic between one and two years from \nthe inception of their partnerships with other airlines.  Unlike the common belief that \nairlines attempt to provide a seamless travel have caused the increase in passenger \ntraffic, the respondents believe that the provision of the joint frequent flyer \nprogramme has played an important role in an upsurge in traffic.  The respondents \n0 1 2 3 4\nTraffic\nLoad factor\nRevenue\nFares\nCost\nscale of 1 to 5, 1=no impact and 5=significant impact\n 7\nbelieve that the rate of increase in traffic tend to stabilise a few years after the launch \nof the alliance. \n \n \n4.1 The impact of alliance on traffic by route type \n \nThe greatest increase in passenger traffic was observed primarily on hub-hub routes, \nand secondarily on hub-non-hub routes. More specifically, the increase in passenger \ntraffic on the hub-hub routes was assessed as \u201csignificant\u201d, with the 45% of \nrespondents experiencing an increase of more than 16%, while the corresponding \npercentage increase for hub-non hub routes ranges from 6 to 15% by 52% of the \nrespondents; as for non hub-non hub routes, all respondents have assessed the traffic \nincrease as moderate, with the percentages equally divided between the 0-5% and the \n6-15% brackets. These results seem absolutely reasonable considering that all global \ncarriers, especially the major ones, operate on the hub-and-spoke system2 and the \nwhole alliance organisation aims at increasing the hub-hub traffic, especially the high-\nyielding and efficient transatlantic routes.     \n \nInternational major carriers including all the American airlines, many of the European \nand South American carriers claimed that alliances have had a significant impact on \ntheir hub-hub.  In case of American and European carriers this is due to the fact that \nthey were the first operators to implement the hub and spoke system.  However, Asian \ncarriers claimed a moderate increase in their traffic on their hub-hub routes.  This \ncould be due to the possibility that these carriers have not exploited their hubs \noperation to the same extent as their counterparts in the US and Europe.  It must also \nbe born in mind that the US and European partners in most cases have benefited from \nantitrust immunity3 which allow them to harmonise their operation more effectively.   \n \n                                                 \n2 An operational system for deploying aircraft that enables a carrier to increase service options at all \nairports encompassed by the system. It entails the use of a strategically located airport (the hub) served \nby more than one airline as a passenger exchange point for flights to and from outlying towns and cities \n(the spokes or non-hub). With this system flights from numerous points (the spokes) arrive at and then \ndepart from a common point (the hub) within a short time from so that traffic arriving from any given \npoint can connect to flights departing to numerous other points. At the hub airport inbound and \noutbound schedules, that is the connecting traffic, are coordinated with the aim of producing the most \nconvenient and\/or transshipment for passengers.  \n \n3 Antitrust immunity from US antitrust laws enables partner airlines to make joint decisions on pricing, \nscheduling, capacity provision and service quality.  Without such immunity airline alliances would be very \nrestricted in terms of what aspects of their business they could jointly undertake \n \n \n \n 8\nFigure 4 \nAlliance impact on the traffic by route type \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\n80%\n90%\nHub - Hub Hub - Non-hub Non-hub - Non-hub\n%\n o\nf r\nes\npo\nnd\nen\nts\nSignificant Impact Some Impact No Impact\n \n \n \n4.2 The impact of alliance on traffic by type of cooperation  \n \nIt was revealing that among the chosen types of cooperation, that is FFP, Code share, \nStrategic Alliance with antitrust immunity and Strategic Alliance without antitrust \nimmunity, it is the code sharing and strategic airline alliances with anti trust immunity \nthat seem to be regarded as the most efficient form of cooperation by the airlines \nthemselves without certainly disregarding the significance and contribution of the \nother two. Several respondents also stressed that the impact of antitrust immunity is \njust beginning to unfold but they consider it as a very important element as it provides \nairlines with ability and flexibility and possibility to coordinate their activities in \nscheduling and pricing.   A few airlines stressed that they have experienced negative \nimpact from \u201cStrategic Alliance without antitrust immunity\u201d.  A very small number of \nAsian carriers believe that strategic alliances have no impact on traffic.  This can be \n 9\nattributed to the fact that Strategic Alliances are evolving in a risky and uncertain \nenvironment in which airlines are demanded to make a commitment without being \ncertain of the future evolution of the alliance.   \n \nFigure 5 \nImpact of type of airline cooperation on traffic \n \n \n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\n80%\nFFP Code Share Strategic Alliance\nw ithout AI\nStrategic Alliance\nw ith AI\n%\n o\nf r\nes\npo\nnd\nen\nts\nNo impact Some Impact Significant Impact\n \nThe provision of joint FFP is considered very effective in boosting traffic. The joint \nscheme should enable members to collect and redeem points or miles on any one of \nthe partner airlines.  It would also allow the recognition of elite status by a greater \nnumber of member airlines, as opposed to just the one airline to which the qualified \npassenger belongs. Most of the times FFP and Code Sharing co-exist and constitute a \nmuch more common form of cooperation than Strategic Alliances whether with \nantitrust immunity or without antitrust immunity.  \n \n4.3 The impact of alliance on traffic by alliance groupings \n \n \nThe SkyTeam members seemed to be the most satisfied from the alliance performance \nfollowed by the Star members. No member of the oneworld alliance has rated their \nalliance cooperation as \u201cexcellent\u201d and it has the only carrier that has taken a neutral \nattitude towards alliances. This is probably due to the lack of deeper cooperation \namong the members. This by alliance comparative review points out that antitrust \nimmunity is a major parameter for the success of an alliance as far as traffic is \nconcerned. \n \nAlmost all members in the Skyteam and Wings believe that the most increase in \ntraffic has taken place on their hub-hub routes where as the corresponding percentage \nfor oneworld and Star alliance is 50% and 80% respectively. \u201cWings\u201d has \n 10\nexperienced the highest increase on its hub-non hub routes. It must be born in mind \nthat \u201cWings\u201d is made up of only two carriers, therefore it is difficult to compare it \nwith the other alliances whose membership ranges from 6 to 13 members. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 6 \nThe alliance impact on traffic by alliance groupings \n0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% 120%\nSkyteam\nWings\noneworld\nStar Alliance\n% of respondents\nHub-Hub Hub-Non Hub Non Hub-Non Hub\n \n \n \n \nWings appears to have experienced the most positive impact in all aspects of their \noperations.  Skyteam has benefited greatly from increase in traffic and revenue; the \nincrease in revenue may be attributed to the deeper cooperation existing among the \npartners of this alliance.  \n \nTable 1 : Impact of alliances on airlines operations by alliance groupings \n  Skyteam Wings oneworld Star alliance \nTraffic 3.8 5.0 3.5 3.3 \nLoad factor 3.3 4.5 3.0 3.1 \nRevenue  3.8 4.5 2.7 3.0 \nFare increases 2.0 3.5 1.8 2.1 \nCost reductions 2.0 3.0 2.8 2.3 \nScale of 1 to 5, 1= no impact and 5=significant impact \n \n4.4 The impact of alliance on traffic by airline size \n 11\nLarge airlines, in general, seems to be satisfied with their alliance cooperation, \nhowever with some reservations. While two thirds stated that their partnership with \nother airlines in good only one third viewed it as excellent.  The majority experienced \nthe increase in traffic in the first year of launching their partnership.  Almost half of \nthe large carriers have experienced up to 5% increase in traffic.  The increase in traffic \nhas largely taken place for these carriers on hub to hub routes. They believe code-\nsharing and strategic alliance with anti-trust immunity have a significant impact on \ntraffic, scoring them as 4.3 and 4.5 respectively on a scale of 1 to 5.      \n \nWhile medium size airlines are generally satisfied with their alliance cooperation \nsmall carriers have some reservation about their relationship with their partners.  This \ncould be due to their influence on the decision making within the alliance groupings.  \nThe medium and small carriers have also benefited from increase in traffic due to \nformation of alliances but it has taken them longer- up to two years- to experience the \nrise in traffic.  A large proportion have experienced up to 15% increase in traffic.  \nThis could be due to the fact that their base traffic is smaller than those of the larger \ncarriers.  It is interesting to note that medium and small carriers believe frequent flyer \nprogramme cooperation and code sharing have had a significant impact on their \ntraffic.  Clearly small and medium sized carriers benefit more by joining the large \nairline frequent flyer programme. \n \n Figure 7: The impact of the different alliance cooperation types on traffic by airline \nsize \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4.5 The impact of alliance on traffic by region \n0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0\nLarge\nMedium\nSmall\nScore 1 to 5, 1=no impact, 5=significant impact\nFFP Code Share Strategic Alliance without AI Strategic Alliance with AI\n 12\nThe analysis of the responses indicates that Central and South America have \nexperienced the greatest increases in traffic, load factors and revenues as a result of \nalliances.

This is the reason also why half of the carriers from this region-the highest \npercentage among all regions- characterize alliances as \u201cexcellent\u201d. The greatest \nincrease in fares has been registered in Asia, whereas as far as costs are concerned it \nis European carries that report the most significant decrease, and the carriers of this \nregion are among those that feel more pressingly the need to reduce costs. As it was \nexpected, it is the North American airlines followed by the European ones that have \nexperienced the most significant positive impact from antitrust immunity since it is \nthey that have the majority of these exemptions.  \n \n \n  Figure 8: Alliance impact on traffic according to geographical region \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe above figure depicts how the carriers of the different geographical regions \nestimate the impact of the alliances they participate to on their traffic. It is the Central \nand South American carriers that seem to have experienced the greatest increase in \ntraffic, which can be explained both by the fact that it is the area that is undergoing \nthe greatest increase in traffic and by the fact that these carriers had a rather limited \nnetwork before the establishment of the alliances. No airline of this region has \nrecorded an increase lower than 6%. Asia and Oceania is the region that has stated the \nsecond greatest increase in traffic, with the majority of carriers stating an increase in \ntraffic ranging from 6 to 15%. This geographic region includes many developing \ncountries and has organized in these last years many important athletic events. \nEuropean carriers have declared the lowest increase since the carriers from this region \n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\n80%\nup to 5%  6\/15% above 16%\n%\n o\nf r\nes\npo\nnd\nen\nts\neurope asia\/oceania north america south & central america\n 13\nhad before the formation of the alliances an extensive network and numerous \nconnections with all the other geographical regions of the world. \n \nException to this general trend were the North American and European carriers, such \nas the members of \u201cWings\u201d (Northwest Airlines and KLM) which have been \ncooperating within this framework for many years and for these carriers Strategic \nAlliance with antitrust immunity is very important. On the contrary, Asian carriers \nconsider FFP as the most important factor given that their Code Sharing agreements \nand Strategic Alliances are much more difficult to operate because of regulatory \nrestrictions. \n \nConclusion \n \nThe overall substantial conclusion is that alliances, despite the form of cooperation \nchosen and established among the partners, entail numerous benefits for the airlines \nand certainly do come up to the initial expectations. Alliances bring about an increase \nin passenger traffic with a parallel increase in load factors and some reduction in \ncosts. Thus, a clear improvement of revenue is observed, a fact resulting from the \ncombination of the increase in traffic and the decrease in costs. Fares, on the contrary, \ndo not move along the same course since in certain cases there is an increase and in \nothers there is no increase. \n \nThe questionnaire analysis indicates that both passenger traffic and load factors of all \nairlines show clear increase. This in return has positively impacted revenue, while the \nimpact on costs, even though positive, remains comparatively limited at least on a \nshort -term basis. The impact on passenger traffic is relatively substantial and has \nbeen experienced from one to two years since the inception of alliance cooperation.  \nThe increase in traffic has mostly been experienced on hub-hub routes. As regards the \nimpact on fares, the situation remains rather hazy, since the majority of airlines have \ngiven ambiguous answers when asked to state whether there has been increase or \ndecrease of fares.  \n \nThe greatest benefits from alliances result from the more advanced and integrated \nforms of cooperation, just as the one that links the carries of the \u201cWings\u201d alliance, \nwhich is characterised by the existence of antitrust immunity    and the establishment \nof a joint venture. Most alliances however, remain \u201cstrategic\u201d only in name, at least at \ntheir present stage, basing their cooperation on Code Share and FFP coordination and \nhave not proceeded to deeper integration. \n \n 14\nReferences: \n \nAir Transport Intelligence.

Pergamon. \n 15\nAppendix A \n \nDescription of airline alliances \n \n \n\u201cWings\u201d \nWings is the non-official name for the alliance of KLM, Northwest Airlines and \nContinental Airlines. KLM and Northwest have had a far reaching alliance agreement \nsince 1989, with common branding, purchasing, management, marketing and FFP, \nalthough an equity stake that KLM had in Northwest was sold after disagreement of \ncontrol of Northwest. In 1999 Northwest Airlines bought a stake in Continental \nAirlines, and announced co-operation including code sharing and frequent flyer \nparticipation. In 1998, KLM and Alitalia concluded an alliance agreement, setting up \npassenger and cargo joint-ventures to manage the airlines operations and marketing \nbut the agreement was dismantled in August 2000.  KLM and Northwest received \nantitrust immunity from the US DOT in November 1993. \n \nStar Alliance  \nStar Alliance was launched in May 1997, by Air Canada, Lufthansa, SAS, Thai and \nUnited airlines to create a global airline network. Varig joined the alliance in October \n1997, with Ansett Australia and Air New Zealand in March 1999. Ansett \nsubsequently left as it ceased operatoins in March 2002. All Nippon Airways joined \nthe Star Alliance in October 1999, Austrian Airlines Group including Lauda Air and \nTyrolean Airways joined in March 2000 and Singapore Airlines in April 2000. British \nMidland and Mexicana joined in July 2000. Star Alliance has a total of almost 2000 \naircraft, serves around 800 destinations in 130 countries worldwide and transports \nmore than a quarter of a billion passengers annually, through extensive code share \nagreements, with 'round the world' fares for global travellers. The alliance allows \naccess to over 500 Star Alliance lounges around the world, reciprocal FFPs, through \ncheck-in, streamlined airport operations, cargo co-operation, joint purchasing, \nadvertising and promotions. US Airways will join the alliance as United Airlines has \ncome up serious financial problems. Lufthansa\/UA alliance has received antitrust \nimmunity from the US DOT \n \noneworld  \nA global marketing alliance announced in September 1998. American Airlines, \nBritish Airways, Canadian, Cathay Pacific, Finnair, Iberia and Qantas offer closer \nlinking of FFPs, reciprocal access to airport lounges, smoother transfers between \ncarriers and a range of global products including \u2018oneworld Explorer\u2019 fares. After the \ntakeover by Air Canada, Canadian Airlines left oneworld on June 1, 2000, while Lan \nChile and Aer Lingus joined on the same date. \n \nSkyTeam  \nIt is the most recent global alliance. Formed in 1999 by Air France and Delta Air \nLines, it has extended its reach with Aeromexico and Korean Air as well as Czech \ncarrier CSA in October 2000 while Alitalia joined in July 2001.  With a marketing \nfocus on passenger service, that is, code sharing, joint marketing and reciprocal \nfrequent flyer programs, its strategy is based on market synergies and the growth \npotential of Paris-CDG as a connection platform. Cargo cooperation is also part of the \n 16\nalliance. SkyTeam is expanding and currently offers nearly 7,100 flights to more than \n470 destinations. It also has 289 reception lounges. \n \nThe global alliance groupings \u2013 traffic\/revenue totals and \nworld market share \nPassenger traffic (RPK) Passenger numbers Group revenues \n billion share million share $ billion share \n\u201cWings\u201d 176 6,0% 70,1 4,3% 16 4,5% \nStar Alliance 637 21,7% 279,2 17,2% 70 20,0% \noneworld 471 16,1% 198 12,2% 46 13,2% \nSkyTeam 352 12,0% 207,4 12,8% 37 10,5% \nTotal Alliances 1636 55,8% 754,7 46,5% 169 48,2% \nSource: Airline Business (September 2002) \n \n \nAlliances and their members \n\u201cWings\u201d \n Date joined Region \nKLM Jun-89 Europe \nNorthwest Airlines Jun-89 North America \n \nStar Alliance \n Date joined Region \nAir Canada May-97 North America \nAir New Zealand Mar-99 Oceania\/Asia \nANA Oct-99 Oceania\/Asia \nAsiana Mar-03 Oceania\/Asia \nAustrian Mar-00 Europe \nbmi british midland Jul-00 Europe \nLufthansa May-97 Europe \nMexicana Jul-99 Central and South America \nSAS May-97 Europe \nSingapore Apr-00 Oceania\/Asia \nSpanair Mar-03 Europe \nThai Airways May-97 Oceania\/Asia \nUnited Airlines May-97 North America \nVarig Oct-97 Central and South America \n \n 17\noneworld \n Date joined Region \nAer Lingus Jun-00 Europe \nAmerican Airlines Sep-98 North America \nBritish Airways Sep-98 Europe \nCathay Pacific Sep-98 Oceania\/Asia \nFinnair Sep-99 Europe \nIberia Sep-99 Europe \nLanChile Jun-00 Central and South America \nQantas Airways Sep-98 Oceania\/Asia \n \nSkyTeam \n Date joined Region \nAeromexico Sep-99 Central and South America \nAir France Sep-99 Europe \nAlitalia Jul-01 Europe \nCSA Czech Airlines Mar-01 Europe \nDelta Air Lines Sep-99 North America \nKorean Air Jul-00 Oceania\/Asia \nSource: Airline Business (September 2002) \n \n \n \n"}
