We do not \nhave to go far back in the history of most demo-\ncratic states, however, to find a distinct role for \npolitical violence. Moreover, many inhabitants \nof the globe still remain at risk of falling prey to \nwidespread violence in the struggle for political \noffice.\nForms of political violence differ a great deal. \nWe focus on two important manifestations: \nrepression and civil war distinguished by whether \nviolence is one-sided or two-sided. Repression is \none-sided use of violence by the incumbent gov-\nernment to stay in office, effectively repressing \nany latent insurgency by the opposition. Civil \nwar is two-sided use of violence by the state as \nwell as an insurgent group.1 These two types of \nviolence have been studied extensively by politi-\ncal scientists and economists, but have typically \nbeen treated as separate phenomena.2\nWe present a unified approach to studying \nthese forms of political violence with common \nroots in poverty, natural resource rents, and \nweak political institutions. First, we lay out a \nrudimentary model to analyze whether violence \nwill occur and, if so, manifest itself as repression \nor civil war.3 Three regimes\u2014peace, repression \n1 We model the motive for insurgency as the desire to \ntake over control of the state. This is a significant motive for \ninsurgency in practice\u2014see the discussion in James Fearon \n(2008)\n2 See Christopher Blattman and Edward Miguel (forth-\ncoming) for a recent review of the literature on civil con-\nflict. Paul Collier and Dominic Rohner (2008) and Benedikt \nGoderis and Mila Versteeg (2008), among others, study \ndeterminants of state repression.\n3 The model and results here are based on Timothy \nBesley and Torsten Persson (2008). The idea of looking at\nRepression or Civil War?\nBy Timothy Besley and Torsten Persson*\nand civil war\u2014emerge as alternative equilib-\nrium outcomes in the interaction between an \nincumbent government and an opposition group. \nMoreover, the theory suggests a natural order-\ning of these regimes.\nWe then construct empirical measures of \nrepression and civil war, which we map into \nordered variables as suggested by the theory. \nWe investigate how the regime depends on eco-\nnomic and political variables, using an ordered \nlogit model defined over the three regimes. Our \nestimation results indicate a strong correlation \nbetween low incomes, weak political institu-\ntions and both forms of political violence.\nI. Theory and Prediction\nThere are two groups denoted by J : an incum-\nbent government I and an opposition O.4 Each \ngroup makes up half the population and can \nmobilize a fraction AJ(\u2264 1\/2) of its citizens as \nmembers of an army. Let \u03b4 J \u2208 {0, AJ } denote \neach group\u2019s decision whether to mobilize. \nModeling this as a discrete choice is a bit artifi-\ncial, but helps keep the analysis simple.\nA conflict can result in a transition of power \nfrom the incumbent to the opposition group. \nThe probability that the opposition wins office \nis given by the linear conflict technology\n  1 __ \n2\n+  1 __ \u03bc [\u03b4 O \u2212 \u03b4I ] .\nWe assume that AI\/\u03bc \u2264 1\/2 \u2264 1 \u2212 AO\/1, which \nholds for large enough \u03bc.5 This function entails \nthe (non-essential) assumption that in the \nabsence of fighting, each group has an equal \nchance of becoming the incumbent.\na wider range of political regimes is also suggested in Jean-\nPaul Azam (2005).\n4 Besley and Persson (2008) sets up a more general \nmodel with similar conclusions, but focus on the analysis \nof civil war.\n5 If this assumption does not hold\u2014or if the opposition \nhas a relative advantage in fighting\u2014the model permits the \npossibility of \u201cunopposed violence\u201d (terrorism), an interest-\ning possibility beyond the scope of this short paper.\n* Besley: London School of Economics and CIFAR, \nHoughton Street, London WC2A 2AE, UK, (e-mail: \nt.besley@lse.ac.uk); Persson: Institute for International \nEconomic Studies and CIFAR, Stockholm University, S-106 \n91 Stockholm, Sweden (e-mail: Torsten.Persson@iies.su.se). \nWe thank Mauricio Cardenas and Raghu Rajan for com-\nments, David Seim and Prakarsh Singh for research assis-\ntance, and Benedikt Goderis for sharing his data with us.\nVOL. 99 NO. 2 293REPREssION OR CIVIL WAR?\nThe winning group has access to a fixed \namount of government revenue denoted by R, \nwhich we interpret as natural resource rents. (However, this \u201cprize\u201d could relate to any, eco-\nnomic or noneconomic, issue determined by \nthe incumbent.) But the winner is constrained \nby institutions in distributing the prize. An \ninstitutionalized sharing rule says that the \nincumbent gets (1 \u2212 \u03b8)2R while the opposition \nreceives \u03b82R where \u03b8 \u2208 [0, 1\/2]. With \u03b8 = 1\/2, \nthere is full sharing with each group getting \nits per capita share of revenue while \u03b8 = 0 \nmeans that institutional constraints are entirely \nabsent. In this sense, higher \u03b8 represents better \ninstitutions.\nEach citizen supplies a unit of labor to a mar-\nket earning a real wage of w. The incumbent \narmy is financed by a labor tax on all citizens \nso that each group only bears half the cost. In \ncontrast, the insurgent army of the opposition \ngroup is financed exclusively by the opposition \nwhich thus bears the full per capita cost. This \nis a natural asymmetry, given the incumbent\u2019s \ncontrol of government.\nThe timing is as follows. First, the opposi-\ntion decides whether to mount an insurgency by \nusing its army to seize power. Then, the govern-\nment decides whether to use its army, which it \ncan do whether or not there is an insurgency. \nThese choices and the insurrection technology \nprobabilistically determine who is in power. \nFinally, the winner determines the allocation of \nR.\nPutting the pieces together, the expected per \ncapita payoff of the incumbent group is:\n w a1 \u2212  \u03b4I __ \n2\nb + a 1 __ \n2\n\u2212  1 __ \u03bc [\u03b4O \u2212 \u03b4I  ](1 \u2212 2\u03b8)b 2R.\nThe first term is the net of tax wage, and the sec-\nond is the expected return from holding office, \ngiven the (endogenous) expected probability of \ntransition. The parallel expression for the oppo-\nsition is:\nw a1 \u2212 \u03b4O \u2212  \u03b4I __ \n2\nb \n  + a 1 __ \n2\n+  1 __ \u03bc [\u03b4O \u2212 \u03b4I  ](1 \u2212 2\u03b8)b 2R.\nWe now look for a sub-game perfect Nash \nequilibrium in the sequential game where the \nopposition moves first. It is straightforward to \nidentify three possible equilibria:\nPeace: \u03b4I = \u03b4O = 0, which occurs if 4R(1 \u2212 2\u03b8)\/w \u2264 \u03bc.\nRepression: \u03b4I = AI and \u03b4O = 0, which occurs if \n2R(1 \u2212 2\u03b8)\/w \u2264 \u03bc < 4R(1 \u2212 2\u03b8)\/w.\nCivil war: \u03b4I = AI and \u03b4O = AO, which occurs if \u03bc < 2R(1 \u2212 2\u03b8)\/w.\nIn peace, neither group chooses to fight. Under \nrepression, the government uses its army to stay \nin power. Under civil war, both groups use their \narmies.\nA crucial determinant of the equilibrium is \nthe value of 2R(1 \u2212 2\u03b8)\/w, the ratio of the prize \ncaptured by the winner and the real wage. The \ngreater the natural resource rents at stake (R), \nthe greater the likelihood of a violent outcome. \nThis is also true if wages (w), and hence the \nopportunity cost of fighting, are lower. For inclu-\nsive enough political institutions (\u03b8 close enough \n1\/2), the outcome will be peaceful. Middling \nvalues (all else equal) imply repression, whereas \nvery non-inclusive institutions more likely spurn \ntwo-sided conflict. Finally, political violence is \nless likely when it is less effective in bringing \nabout a change in power (a high value of \u03bc). \nWe expect all these parameters to vary across \ncountries and time in response to economic and \npolitical circumstances.\nRepression becomes a real possibility because \nof the asymmetry in government control. The \ngovernment can use the whole tax base to \nfinance the formal army making it cheaper to use \nviolence. In other words, the classic Weberian \nmonopoly of violence, derived here from \nmonopoly access to taxation, opens the door to \ngovernment repression of the opposition.\nHow can we approach the data in light of the \nmodel? To fix ideas, suppose we observe prox-\nies for variables R, w and \u03b8 across countries and \ntime, but do not observe \u03bc. We also observe if a \nparticular country is in repression or civil war \nin a particular year. Let \u03bc be distributed across \ncountries and time according to some distribution \nwith c.d.f. F( \u2219 ). Then the expressions defining \nequilibrium imply that the probability of observ-\ning civil war is F(2R(1 \u2212 2\u03b8)\/w), the probability \nMAY 2009294 AEA PAPERs AND PROCEEDINGs\nof observing repression is F(4R(1 \u2212 2\u03b8)\/w) \u2212 \nF(2R(1 \u2212 2\u03b8)\/w), while the probability of \nobserving peace is 1 \u2212 F(2R(1 \u2212 2\u03b8)\/w). This \nimmediately suggests that we may estimate an \nordered logit (or probit) to gauge how the vari-\nables identified by the model affect the relative \nprobabilities of the three regimes.\nII. Data and Estimation\nBefore presenting our estimation results, we \ndiscuss how to measure the three ordered states \nand the empirical determinants suggested by the \nmodel.\nA. Measuring Repression and Civil War\nA large body of literature looks at the deter-\nminants of civil war.6 In this paper, we use a \nvariable from the Correlates of War (COW) data \nset, which provides annual data on conflicts (from 1816) up to 1997. The COW intrastatewar \nindicator takes a value of one if a given country \nin a given year is involved in a violent conflict \nwhich claims a (cumulated) death toll of more \nthan 1,000 people. We remove conflicts that \ninvolve interventions by another state and do not \nconsider extra-systemic wars.\nTo measure repression, we use data from two \nindependent sources. The first source is the data \non human rights violations in Mark Gibney, \nLinda Cornett and Reed Wood (2007). These \nare collected by two organizations, the US State \nDepartment and Amnesty International, and are \navailable from 1976 onwards. Each series has \na political terror scale ranked from 1 to 5. We \ntake the maximum value of the two series in any \ngiven country and year and use a cutoff of 3 and \nabove to classify it as repression. This implies \nthat civil and political rights violations such as \nexecution, imprisonment and political murders\/\nbrutality are widespread. In the worst cases, \nleaders of society place no limit on the means \nor thoroughness with which they pursue per-\nsonal or ideological goals. For the period 1976 \nto 2006, around 32 percent of all country years \nare classified as being in repression. Not surpris-\ningly, many of these coincide with civil war.\n6 There are a number of issues involved in the coding \nof conflicts into civil wars. See Nicholas Sambanis (2004) \nfor a thorough discussion about different definitions that \nappear in the empirical literature.\nTo construct the ordered variable suggested by \nthe theory, we set a value of zero when there is \nneither repression nor civil war, one when there \nis repression, but no civil war, and two when \nthere is civil war, whether there is repression or \nnot. We focus on the 21 years of data for which \nwe have measures of both civil war incidence \nand repression. Given our classification rules, \n81 percent of our sample has peace, 8 percent \nrepression, and 11 percent civil war.\nOur second ordered variable is derived from \na measure of repression in Arthur Banks (2005), \nwhich counts up purges: systematic murders \nand eliminations of political opponents within \nregimes. We create an indicator equal to one \nin any year when purges exceed zero. Here, we \nuse the data from 1962 onward in our ordered \nlogits. Over the period 1962\u20132005, on average 6 \npercent of country-years are classified as being \nin repression\u2014the Banks measure is thus much \nmore conservative than the Gibney et al. mea-\nsure. Also, purges seem rarely to coincide with \ncivil war.\nIs there a natural ordering across the three \nstates as in our theory? For income per capita, \nthe answer is a clear-cut yes. According to the \nGibney et al. measure, peaceful countries have \nan average GDP per capita of $6,500, repressing \ncountries are considerably poorer with $3,200, \nwhile the countries in civil war are the poorest \nwith average incomes of $2,000. A similar pat-\ntern is seen for the Banks measure.\nThe regularity across political regimes is \nequally clearcut. Here, we use parliamentary \ndemocracy as our institutional measure to cor-\nrespond to \u03b8 in the theory. By the Gibney et al. \nmeasure, 35 percent of peaceful countries, 16 \npercent of repressing countries, and 9 percent of \ncivil-war countries are in parliamentary democ-\nracy. Again, the ordering is consistent with the \ntheory. A similar pattern again emerges for the \nBanks measure.\nBoth of these findings hint at the validity of \nthinking of peace, repression and civil war as \nordered states featuring different levels of politi-\ncal violence.\nB. Determinants of Repression and Civil War\nTables 1A and 1B explore some evidence \nfrom alternative ordered logit models. For each \nof our two ordered left-hand side variables, we \nuse three specifications. In the first, we include \nVOL. 99 NO. 2 295REPREssION OR CIVIL WAR?\nthe log of GDP, an indicator for parliamentary \ndemocracy, and dummy variables measur-\ning whether a country is a large exporter of \noil or primary products. As a source of exog-\nenous time variation in income, we use data on \nnatural disasters from the EM-DAT data set. \nSpecifically, we construct an indicator that adds \ntogether the number of floods and heat waves in \na given country and year, assuming that both act \nas a negative shock to real incomes. The second \nspecification adds a set of year dummies to con-\ntrol for trending variables. The third specifica-\ntion follows Besley and Persson (2008), adding \nprice indexes for primary exports and imports \nand oil import and export prices. These are \narguably good exogenous measures of (positive) \nshocks to resource rents and (negative) shocks \nto real incomes.\nColumns 1\u20133 of Table 1A display results \nfor our ordered variable based on Gibney et \nal. (2007). The estimated coefficients are \nreported as odds ratios, with a ratio above (below) one corresponding to a positive (nega-\ntive)  nontransformed coefficient. Column 1 \nshows that higher GDP per capita reduces the \nprobability of repression and civil war, while \nthe same is true if a country is a parliamen-\ntary democracy (the significance levels refer \nto an odds ratio significantly different from \none, i.e., a negative coefficient). Large primary \nproducts exporters tend to have lower chances \nof being in repression or conflict, while being \na large oil exporter does not systematically \naffect political violence. Our weather shock \nvariable also predicts a significant increase in \nthe probability of being in repression or civil \nwar. Column 2 shows that these results hold \nup when we include year dummy variables. \nColumn 3 shows that there is a positive corre-\nlation between the likelihood of political vio-\nlence and commodity export prices as well as \noil import prices.\nTable 1A\u2014Ordering Logit Estimates of Determinants of Peace, Repression \nand Civil War\n(1) (2) (3)\nLog GDP 0.668*** 0.652*** 0.660***\n(7.85) (7.56) (6.81)\nParliamentary democracy 0.401*** 0.345*** 0.316***\n(6.98) (7.84) (7.88)\nLarge oil exporter 1.102 1.269 1.081\n(0.63) (1.43) (0.41)\nLarge primary exporter 0.644*** 0.572*** 0.377***\n(3.97) (4.66) (6.80)\nWeather shock 1.186*** 1.420*** 1.399***\n(3.88) (8.32) (7.66)\nExport price index 1.106***\n(3.24)\nImport price index 0.206**\n(2.52)\nOil export prices 1.008\n(0.46)\nOil import prices 1.394***\n(7.68)\nYear dummy variables No Yes Yes\nObservations 1,993 1,993 1,878\nNotes: The dependent variable is constructed from the COW and Gibney et al.

The findings for income per cap-\nita, parliamentary democracy, primary exporter \nstatus and weather shocks are all very similar. \nBut the results are different for the price indexes. \nNow, commodity export and import prices are \nboth significant in the expected direction, as are \noil export prices.\nOverall, the findings are consistent with the \nprediction that economic shocks are impor-\ntant determinants of repression and civil war. \nMoreover, more inclusive political institutions as \nmeasured by parliamentary democracy signifi-\ncantly reduce the prospect of political violence.\nIII. Concluding Comments\nThis paper contributes to the debate about the \nnature of political equilibrium in poor countries \nwith weakly institutionalized polities where the \nuse of political violence can be endemic. We \nargue that it is useful to think about repression \nand civil conflict in a unified way and develop \na simple model to illustrate this argument. Our \napproach recognizes three states, and we discuss \nhow this helps us think about measurement of \npolitical outcomes. Finally, the data support the \nidea that there is indeed an ordering\u2014with peace, \nrepression and conflict as the three states.\nIn our view, it is valuable to study conflict \nfrom the stepping stone of a well-articulated \ntheoretical model. Such an approach holds out \nthe hope that we may better integrate our under-\nstanding of conflict with other issues in political \neconomy\u2014in particular the character of govern-\nment in non-conflict situations. Clearly, much \nremains to do, in order to bridge the gap between \ntheory and data in this area. The ultimate goal \nis to map political and economic circumstances \ninto our wider understanding of the forces that \nshape economic and political development. This \nshort paper is only a small building block in that \nwider project.\nTable 1B\n(1) (2) (3)\nLog GDP 0.631*** 0.630*** 0.626***\n(8.37) (8.24) (7.97)\nParliamentary democracy 0.578*** 0.554*** 0.580***\n(3.36) (3.72) (3.39)\nLarge oil exporter 1.200 1.314* 1.205\n(1.13) (1.67) (1.06)\nLarge primary exporter 0.284*** 0.284*** 0.195***\n(7.30) (7.30) (7.26)\nWeather shock 1.124*** 1.250*** 1.275***\n(2.78) (4.69) (4.93)\nExport price index 1.172***\n(3.83)\nImport price index 1.413\n(0.82)\nOil export prices 1.030***\n(3.33)\nOil import prices 1.198***\n(2.59)\nYear dummy variables No Yes Yes\nObservations 3,549 3,549 3,394\nNotes: The dependent variable is constructed from the COW and from the purges data in Banks \n(2005) as described in the text.
