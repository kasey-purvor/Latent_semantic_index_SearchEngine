Self care by elders is \ndivided, in this preliminary classification, into new strategies for \neveryday living, the reallocation of time and the avoidance of risk. \nManagers who understand that service users are co-producers of care and \nrecognise the need to manage the users, as well as their own staff and \nrelations with other agencies, are more likely to be able to deliver \ngood services. However the management of co-production is at present \nonly theorised for the private sector where ethical issues are less \npressing and users are customers. In future a greater understanding of \nco-production and the development of theory and practice which will \ncombine the management of co-production with the empowerment of users \nwill be essential. \n \n \nIntroduction\n \nPublic sector human service agencies in Britain have traditionally \noperated within a bureaucratic model of organisation. Services were \noffered on a take it or leave it basis and rationing was usually \nachieved by a combination of waiting lists, poor quality and stigma \n(Griffiths 1988). The white paper Caring for People (Cm 849, 1989) and \nthe subsequent NHS and Community Care Act 1990 were intended to \nintroduce a new approach to public management (Pollitt, 1993) to social \ncare agencies. Services were to be consumer oriented ('needs led \nprovision') and management was to be more competitive and market \noriented in style. Local authorities were to become service enablers \nwhile voluntary and private sector agencies (assumed to be customer \noriented) were to take over large areas of service provision. \n \nThe changes leave managers of services for older people with \nconflicting priorities. On the one hand policy rhetoric urges them to \nincrease choice and to empower users (a market oriented model of \nservice provision). On the other hand, the reality of policy \nimplementation when budgets are stationary and needs are rising demands \nstrict rationing combined with fair distribution  (a bureaucratic \nmodel). As Dopson and Stewart (1990) have pointed out, the Act did not \nresolve the fundamental conflict between consumer empowerment and \nservice equity. Managers have been left with little relevant theory or \npractice to fall back on in this time of rapid organisational and \nideological change. This paper, drawing on recent work with service \nmanagers and with older people in the community (2), presents a \npreliminary discussion of two related areas where further research is \nurgently needed. The first is the application and development of \ntheories of co-production to the management of community care services. \nThe second is the particular relationship between co-production of care \nand self care by frail older people.  \n \nCo-production\n \nIn human service agencies co-production is a way of theorising the \ndivision of labour between patients and professionals or between formal \nand informal carers. In this paper the emphasis is on the division \nbetween professionals and frail elders who live in the community. One \nkey characteristic of a service industry is that consumption involves a \nrange of activities by the consumer, or user, as well as by the \nprovider (Sasser, Olsen and Wyck, 1978; Normann, 1991). For example, in \nthe case of university education the final output of an educational \nqualification cannot be achieved unless the user (in this case a \nstudent) undertakes a series of co-production activities ranging from \nprivate study, through attendance at lectures or practicals, to essay \nwriting and examination performance. Similarly, care can only be \ndelivered in the community if care recipients, and\/or their informal \ncarers are willing and able to undertake many care tasks themselves. \nThe NHS and Community Care Act 1990 gave de facto recognition to one \naspect of co-production by accepting that informal carers were major \ncontributors to care and requiring local authorities to provide \nservices which support them. \n \nWhile co-production in terms of work to be performed has been \nrecognised for some time, the implications for service managers have \nnot been discussed. Stacey (1984) for example, discussed the division \nof health care labour between professionals and patients and unpaid \nworkers, mainly women. She concluded that the patient should be seen as \na health worker. The lack of a management approach is hardly \nsurprising. Recent emphasis in public services management has been on \nimporting theory from private sector manufacturing industry. The model \nof independent firm competing with others to deliver a unique and \ndefined product is clearly unsatisfactory but the widget has taken a \nremarkable hold over management education. For example, recent health \nservice guidelines on management competencies fail to make any mention \nof the management of interprofessional or interagency relationships \n(NHS Training Directorate, 1993). The model is one of the manager with \na defined span of control operating within a single clearly bounded \norganisation. However recent work indicates that managers who have \nanything to do with community services (including hospital discharge) \nfind themselves managing services which depend on the input of other \nprofessionals and other agencies (Dockrell and Wilson, forthcoming).  \n \nElders as Co-producers of care\n \nNow that old age, defined as beginning at 60, embraces two generations \na new dimension has to be taken into account in any discussions of \ninformal caregiving. While it is often presumed that the young, defined \nas those under retirement age, look after the old, defined as those \nover retirement age, in fact the situation is very much more complex. \nThe GHS survey in 1985 (Green, 1988) showed that the peak age for \ncaregiving was 45 to 59 (21% of total caregivers). However the share \nfell only to 17% of the total for the 60 to 75 age group. As the \nnumbers of over 80s have increased since 1985 it seems highly likely \nthat the GHS figures understate the amount of caring now being done by \nthe young elderly, those aged 60 to 75. These are the younger \ngeneration of active elders but they are nevertheless classified as \n\"old\" by younger members of the population. In addition, since elderly \nspouses, the main elderly caregivers, often see themselves as simply \nfulfilling their marriage vows, rather than as caregivers, it is very \nlikely that the GHS data underestimates the amount of care provided by \nelders. \n \nAccording to an analysis of the General Household Survey for 1985 by \nEvandrou (1990), the age distribution of elder caregivers differed for \nmen and women. 18% of female caregivers were aged 60-74 and only 6% \nwere 75 or over. In contrast, 14% of male caregivers were aged 60-74 \nwhile 10% were over 74. This difference reflects the fact that most \nolder male caregivers are husbands looking after an elderly wife, while \nwomen have a wider range of caregiving roles. A wife may for example be \nlooking after an elderly disabled husband but equally she may be the \nmain caregiver for a handicapped adult child or for a parent in her \nnineties. Women are also more likely to provide care outside the \nhousehold to older or younger relatives and neighbours. \n \nApart from being heavily involved as informal carers, active older \npeople are making a contribution to voluntary sector organisations \n(Smith, 1992). It is not at present clear how this input will develop \nin the new contract environment of community care. As voluntary sector \nagencies become services providers working to contract, they may either \ndeliberately take on more trained staff, or they may find volunteers \nless willing to work in the new contract culture and be forced to \nsubstitute paid staff for volunteers. Certainly if voluntary agencies \nare to take over large areas of community care, as government policy \nsuggests they should, there will need to be changes in the way \nvolunteers are recruited and managed (Connelly, 1990; Billis and \nHarris, 1992). However these issues are not dealt with in this paper \nsince the emphasis here is on self care rather than informal care. \n \nThe total current input to caregiving by older people has not been \nquantified but an understanding of its importance in terms of informal \nand voluntary sector activity is increasing. The total amount of care \nneeded by frail elders is similarly unmeasured. The question of need is \nusually answered in terms of how many people receive care services, \ncombined with some estimate of unmet need, also defined in service \nterms. Care needs not covered by state services (such as window \ncleaning or privately funded home cleaning) are usually omitted from \nany calculation of 'need' made for planning purposes. Self care, as \ndefined below, continues to be entirely ignored. In future, as the \nnumbers of potentially frail elders rises, there is little chance that \nservices will keep pace. Co-production of care, both self-care and by \ninformal carers, will have to increase (Hickey et al., 1986). \n \nSelf care\n \nSelf care has been characterised more in terms of health practices and \nself medication (De Friese et al., 1989) than as a contribution to \ncommunity care. It has taken on a range of meanings in the medical and \nnursing literature. Illich (1975) saw self care as a way of combatting \nthe power of the medical profession. A less empowering version of the \nterm sees it as an exercise in partnership. In some chronic conditions \nwhich affect younger people, such as diabetes, patients have been \nincreasingly accepted as partners in maintaining health. Alternatively \nself care is defined as treatment for a perceived symptom and refers \nsimply to self medication with non-prescription drugs. In this case it \nmay or may not be viewed as beneficial by health professionals (Haug et \nal., 1989). A more modern development which is diametrically opposed to \nIllich's original approach sees  self care as a component of health \npromotion. On this model those whose self care is deficient may be \nblamed for their own health problems (Kickbush,1989). Self care by \nelders has been recognised within a medical framework (Dean, 1989; Haug \net al, 1991; Penning and Chappell,1990). Dean (1989) linked self care \nto self help and addressed the need to improve the interface between \nself care and formal health services but still did not consider the \nmanagement implications. In the UK, self care (defined as the ability \nto perform activities of daily living (ADL), has been recognised as a \nconceptual area by Booth et al. (1983) but in this case only for those \nliving in institutions. Levels of self care in terms of a score for \nactivities of daily living may be used to discriminate between those \nwho should go into a residential home or a nursing home or who are \nineligible for either. In such cases it is reasonable to see self care \nassessment as a deficit measure which determines dependency, rather \nthan measuring a positive contribution to care. \n \nA closer examination of the lives of elderly people (2) indicates that \nthere is a wide range of activities which constitutes self care in \nadvanced old age. Most activities of daily living are taken for granted \nby young able-bodied people. In later life, after an accident, or \nthrough ill health, or simply because strength declines, activities of \ndaily living can become problematic. Many people find that they can \nonly continue living without assistance if they make major changes in \nthe way they perform a range of basic functions. The situations that \ncall these changes into play may come about suddenly or imperceptibly. \nThey may also be general, as in the case of declining mobility, or much \nmore specific like loss of eyesight. As the disability lobby has so \nstrongly pointed out (see for example Morris, 1991; 1993), many people \nare not disabled by their own condition but by the society in which \nthey live. For example, older people who cannot manage the step on a \nbus would have a great deal more freedom to move about and to do their \nown shopping if all buses had steps that could be lowered to ground \nlevel, as they do in some regions of Sweden (N Desai, personal \ncommunication). The approach of adapting mainstream services for use by \na wider range of people has added advantages of community integration \nand normalisation. Some elders prefer them to individualised methods \nsuch as cheap taxi fares. \n \nSelf care needs will therefore vary according to the physical and \nmental state of the older people concerned but also according to the \nenvironment - physical and social - in which they live. This complex \nrelationship varies between individuals and over time for the same \nindividual. The variation may go some way to explaining why studies of \nthe delivery of services to elderly people frequently find that large \nnumbers who might be said to be in need are not receiving a service \nwhile others who are receiving a service could manage without it \n(Goldberg and Connelly, 1982; Booth, 1983). \n \nWhile much greater recognition is now being given to elders as informal \ncarers and as volunteers, their contribution to co-production in terms \nof self care is still unrecognised.  There are therefore no statistics. \nTheir input is, however, almost certainly larger in terms of hours \nspent or money saved, than input by informal carers. The 1980 GHS \n(Evandrou, 1988) showed less than a third of all elderly people had \nreceived any form of state provided care in the previous year. The \nproportion receiving some caring services rose to 56% among those over \n80. This sounds impressive but in fact it amounted to relatively little \nassistance with daily living. For most older people such services \naverage much less than half an hour as week. E.g the chiropody service, \nused by 13% of all people over 65 in 1980, usually amounts to less than \n30 minutes every three months. \n \nThe services that consume large amounts of resources were even more \nthinly distributed. Only 9% of men and women over 65 received home help \nin 1980. Five percent were visited by a district nurse in the year \nbefore the survey. The same proportion went to day centres for older \npeople and only 2% received any meals on wheels. When it is realised \nthat in large parts of the country meals on wheels was not a 5 or 7 day \nservice but was typically confined to two or three days a week, it can \nbe seen that the great majority of elders with care needs were looking \nafter themselves or relying on their relatives and friends. There is no \nreason to believe that this distribution changed greatly between 1980 \nand 1990. Since then a number of Social Service Departments, for \nexample Greenwich, Kent and Birmingham, have considered transferring \nthe home help service to the private sector, cutting the hours or \nrestricting the service to users who need personal care. It is unclear \nwhether the proportion of frail elders receiving care has fallen or \nwhether the amount of care received is now spread more thinly, or both.  \n \nThe numbers of frail older people has increased since 1980 and is \nprojected to go on increasing. It is argued here that self care \nincludes all those activities which allow older people with care needs \nto continue living in the community without recourse to formal or \ninformal health and social care. The state, in particular, provides \nassistance with a very narrow range of life activities. The help which \nis provided may do very little to ensure good quality of life, though \nit may stave off entry into an institution. In future the steps which \nolder people themselves take to substitute for formal and informal care \nshould be added to any consideration of caregiving in later life.  \n \nSuch self care can be divided into three major categories: new \nstrategies which allow activities of daily living to continue even \nthough the method is different; major changes in the use of time; and \nthe avoidance of risk. These categories are not exhaustive and they may \noften overlap. For example the avoidance of risk associated with going \nto the shops may entail giving up shopping and accepting an offer of \nhelp, or ceasing to cross a major road and so limiting the shops used, \nor simply moving much more slowly.  \n \nNew strategies \n \nIn advanced old age most people experience some limitation in their \nactivities even if they are only slowed down rather than actually \nprevented by ill health or disability from doing things they formerly \ndid (Day, 1985; 1991). Chronological age cannot predict how much time \nself care will take in later life but among those over 75 the majority \nare likely to find that some attention to strategies in terms of \nactivities of daily living is essential if they are to continue living \nwithout assistance. An example is going up and down stairs in a sitting \nposition rather than standing up. Such an activity cannot, due to \nsocial constraints, be undertaken outside the home, but it will enable \na person with severe knee problems to go on functioning in a house with \nstairs, even though they can no longer negotiate steps in a \nconventional manner. Taking a bath by standing in a washing up bowl \nfalls into the same category. It is not a normal way of washing in \nmodern Britain but it may be the only way for elders who cannot get in \nor out of a bath unaided and who have no shower. The choice is between \na deterioration in personal hygiene which could lead to skin problems \nor a new strategy. Most elders are unlikely to see a fortnightly visit \nfrom a bath nurse or other paid caregiver as a solution but may accept \nit as part of an inevitable deterioration in the quality of life. Other \nstrategies may be specific to a particular environment. For example \nthere may be ways of getting to and from shops that do not involve \nraised curbs on the pavements, or special routines that allow cooking \nto be done with the minimum of effort.  \n \nPlanning is often essential. There is a range of things that frail \nelders can do if all goes according to plan. They may not however be \nable to cope with unforeseen interference. Long distance visits or \nholidays may frequently have to be given up for this reason. In one \ncase an 82 year old woman explained that she had given up going to her \nniece in Birmingham because on the last visit her train had been one \nand a half hours late and she had only been able to get home because a \nyoung neighbour, now moved away, had waited for her and 'fetched her \nhome'. Many others had given up rail travel on Sundays because of the \ndelays. Another problem was that even carefully laid plans can involve \nlong waits or difficult conditions.  As another very frail 85 year old \nwoman said: \n'Every year I went (to visit friends in Switzerland) and there were \nalways days when I was in a panic, when I thought I can't do \nthis, I mustn't do this any more, next year I won't... Sometimes \nI think I have to become a bit more sensible and face it, that I \ncan't do it any more.  Last year I had to change from the railway \nto the airport in Switzerland, in Basle. It was terribly hot and \nI had to stand at the bus stop by the railway station going out \nto the airport and I still remember, it was terrible.  When the \nweather is cooler you don't feel it. I don't know whether I will \ngo or not. It would probably be sensible not. \n \nThe reallocation of time \n \nSecond, some or all activities of daily living may become extremely \ntime consuming (Sinclair et al., 1988: 53). When it takes two hours to \ndress in the morning, dressing can no longer be considered a 'normal' \nactivity. It has become an activity that needs assistance to be \ncompleted in the normal time. With care, patience and planning it can \nstill be undertaken by a motivated individual but without that care, \nassistance would be needed. Luckily most aspects of normal life are \namenable to being performed very slowly. Cooking, cleaning and \ngardening are the most obvious.  \n \nTime saving equipment can help. As with other forms of disability, the \nsaving of time becomes a saving of energy. Elders who can afford a \nmicrowave or who have relatives who give them one, are free of many of \nthe problems of cooking. If they like, and can afford, ready made \nfreeze chill meals there is little they have to do. Oven chips have \nalso taken much of the drudgery out of cooking for many men and women. \nCleaning has proved less amenable to technological advance. If \nrelatives, home help or a private service are not available or not \nliked, cleaning can be dealt with by doing less of it more slowly. One \n94 year old explained that her day was composed of housework in the \nmorning, rest in the afternoon, preparation of an evening meal and then \na visit to either of two friends in the same street. She lacked the \nenergy to garden and found that these very basic activities took up all \nher time.  \n \nAvoidance of risk \n \nRisk avoidance is often assumed to be a major prerogative of social \nservice professionals - an area where professional judgement is called \nfor (Brearley, 1982). Risk is often given as a reason for putting in \npaid help, but most risk avoidance is performed by elders themselves. \nActivities are voluntarily limited or given up completely. This \napproach to self care can easily be taken for granted. In Cumming and \nHenry's (1961) theory of ageing, withdrawal from social and other \nactivities is elevated into a functionally rewarding approach to \nageing. There is no doubt that society does willingly allow older \npeople to give up many normal activities and to limit their lifestyles \nin important ways. Transport is perhaps the most obvious example. The \nrisks involved in attempts to move around outside the home may \nincrease, either permanently or temporarily in advanced old age. \nStrategies which reduce the risks associated with shopping or attending \noutside functions such as meetings or places of entertainment can be \nclassified as self care. Unfortunately the commonest strategy is \nvoluntary withdrawal. For example an 81 year old widow who had problems \nwith balance said: \n'Well I think I could get on a bus, but I would never dare to try to \nget off public transport without pitching forward, so it's taxis, \nlifts or rides.  \n \nThe same may be true of window cleaning and other heavy cleaning or \ngardening. If relatives will not fill the gap there may be no \nalternative but to give up or to continue until an accident makes it \nclear that such an activity is too dangerous. \n \nRecognising and operationalising co-production\n \nThe recognition of the full range of co-production activities as an \nessential consideration in the management of community care services \nhas implications for purchasers and providers. In the first place it is \nhard to combine self care with formal and even with some informal \nservices. At the extreme, admission to residential care disables \nvirtually all aspects of self care. The provision of formal domiciliary \nservices may be less drastic but few health or social care employees \nhave time to wait while elders do things at their own pace. Formal \ncarers from the state sector are often forced to take over some \nactivities of daily living for their clients if they are to get through \ntheir case loads. Privately paid or voluntary formal carers may be \nunder less pressure but there is still the feeling that they are there \nto do a job and hence cannot wait about while parts of it are done very \nslowly or unconventionally. There is also the problem that many aspects \nof self care are private. They involve unconventional behaviour of some \nsort. It follows that they cannot easily be performed when others are \npresent. This will apply to all paid staff but may also apply to \nrelatives.  \n \nMany relatives strongly discourage unconventional behaviour of any \nkind. For example, one women who tried becoming a vegetarian, partly \nfor health reasons and partly because it was cheaper and she needed \nmoney to pay for transport, was quickly told by her non-resident \ndaughter that such behaviour was irresponsible. She felt she had to \nstop. Another who had devised a way of defrosting her freezer by \nsitting on the kitchen floor was found by her daughter and told to \nstop. \n \nWhile it is relatively easy to define co-production, there are a number \nof difficulties in operationalising it as a management tool. The first \nis the lack of relevant theory on public human services management. Two \ncommon factors are identified in the literature on the management of \nservice industries in the private sector. One is that these industries \nare distinguished by the personal demands they make upon staff and the \nsecond is that the customer has an important input to the production of \nservices (see for example Sasser, Olsen and Wyck, 1978; Normann, 1991).  \n \nStaff in human services agencies are particularly liable to  emotional \nwear and tear (or burn out) (Normann, 1991). In elder care a very high \nproportion of services go to people who have dementia or who are in the \nlast stages of life. Such services make very high demands on staff who \noften have to deal with extremely difficult clients or patients and at \nthe same time face up to their own fears of dependency and death \n(Wilkinson and Wilson, 1992). The nature of these agencies therefore \nposes human resource management problems which are at present \nundertheorised. Normann (1991) offers a number of ways forward. For \nexample he sees the management task as including ways of enabling users \nto increase the self esteem of front line staff. This will be difficult \nif the users are disgruntled because their services have been cut, but \nwith better targeting (Davies et al 1990) it might be possible.  \n \nThere is also a clear need for better human resource management with \nbetter training and conscious attempts to make work more rewarding for \nall grades of staff (Normann, 1991). As Flynn (forthcoming) has pointed \nout, staff development, and staff and user empowerment becomes \ndifficult, if not impossible, when managers see their role as \ncontrolling the workforce and its tasks. Management by commitment on \nthe other hand needs greater trust and allows staff more autonomy. It \nis more likely to produce high quality services but there is a danger \nthat current trends in service contracting mean a shift towards \nmanagement by control. \n \nA second problem arises from multi-agency nature of elder care and the \nexistence of a purchaser-provider split in health and social services. \nThe input of service users and of informal carers is fragmented across \na number of management systems (Dockrell and Wilson, forthcoming). In \nmost cases service planning, assessment, provision, and monitoring or \nquality assurance are no longer part of the same hierarchy. The actual \ndivision of activities varies from place to place but there will be \nvery few service users who deal with only one management system. The \nmanagement of different relationships of co-production will therefore \nvary according to the activity being considered and the stage in \nservice provision.  \n \nIt follows that the ability to see the management task as one of \nmanaging users and carers as well as an agency and its interagency \nrelations demands a cultural shift. This shift is not dissimilar to \nthat needed for managing for quality (Wilding, 1994), nor is it in \nconflict with Sir Roy Griffiths' original intentions for community \ncare. Each stage as set out in DoH guidelines (DoH, 1991; 1991b) is \nconsidered below. The processes are continuous and must take account of \nchanges in the mix of self care and formal and informal care.  \n \nService planning is the area where co-production is perhaps most \nadvanced. The NHS and Community Care Act 1990 required local \nauthorities to consult with users in the planning of community care \nservices, though there has been no such demand placed on health \nauthorities. Planners and managers, used to the old traditions of needs \nanalysis have often found it hard to incorporate user views in any \nmeaningful sense. McGrath and Grant (1992) give a detailed analysis of \nthe difficulties taking the case of the All Wales Strategy, but Cormie \n(1992) and Barnes (1993) show that user input can be managed \neffectively and can have beneficial outcomes. \n \nAssessment is a key stage in service delivery. If it is intended only \nas a rationing device (Rivlin and Wiener, 1988), a minimal input is all \nthat is needed from the potential user. However if assessment is used \nas may have been intended (DoH SSI, 1991a; 1991b), to allocate scarce \nresources to those most in need of support in the community, users \nshould make as full an input as possible. Management procedures, such \nas multidisciplinary assessment forms which can recognise and value co-\nproduction, will be needed by staff doing assessments.  \n \nAt present care planning is often seen very much as an activity which \nis led by professionals (DoH SSI, 1991a; 1991b, Ellis,1993). The degree \nof user input varies but the fact that older people and\/or their \nrelatives and friends have in most cases been planning packages of care \nfor some time before they come to the attention of health or social \nservices (Wilson, forthcoming) is routinely ignored. Service management \nwhich is based on an understanding of co-production will be more likely \nto take account of take the work of users and informal carers when \ndesigning care support. They will be less likely to put in services \nwhich duplicate or conflict with existing care packages. The aim should \nbe to move from the implicit or needs based recognition of co-\nproduction which occurs at present in the determination of support \nservices (they must support something already there) to overt \nrecognition. Such a change in service culture will need management \nsupport.  \n \nThe same is true in managing service delivery. Since paid staff can \noffer only very limited amounts of support in most cases (Wilson, 1993) \nthe main work of caring in terms of activities of daily living has to \nbe done by the service recipients themselves or by their informal \ncarers. As stated above, little is known about how best to link formal, \ninformal and self care in ways that are efficient, effective and \nethical, but there is clearly scope for improvement (Sinclair et al., \n1988; Levin et al., 1989; Allen et al, 1992). The main burden at \npresent falls on front line staff but managers who saw their role as \nmanaging user input as well as staff input would be able to take a more \nstrategic view of the type of service development needed. \n \nManagers of purchasing agencies have a different interest in co-\nproduction. They need, ideally, to enlist the users as monitors of \nservice quality and effectiveness. At the stage of final service \ndelivery only individual users and carers can assess the quality of \nservices. Their views may differ from each other and from \nprofessionals, but they are undoubtedly important co-producers of \nquality assurance. Services which are judged by their recipients to be \nof low quality are not likely to be efficient in terms of maintaining \npeople in the community or supporting carers, unless the nature of the \nresidential sector is a very strong deterrent to entry. \n \nProblems with the theory of co-production\n \nAs stated above much more work is needed on the theory of co-production \nin the public sector. Normann's (1991) work on the private sector \nraises a number of problems. In the first place there is the question \nof language. Is co-production any different from 'partnership' or any \nother currently fashionable item of jargon associated with user \nempowerment? At the level of front line service delivery the answer is \nprobably no. Partnership between patient or client, informal carers, \nprivate, voluntary and state service providers involves co-production \nat all stages from assessment to service monitoring. However service \nmanagers from first level upwards have relatively little direct contact \nwith service users (Dockrell and Wilson, forthcoming) and cannot easily \nsee themselves as partners in service delivery. It is at management \nlevel, therefore, that the concept of 'co-production' becomes more \nuseful. Management systems and practices which recognise co-production \nat all stages from service planning onwards (Normann, 1991), could \ngreatly improve the quality of services provided, in terms of \neffectiveness and acceptability, and should also enhance staff \nsatisfaction and reduce burn out.  \n \nOne problem which applies to any translation of theory from the private \nsector to a mainly publicly financed mixed economy of welfare is that \nservice users are not customers in the same sense as they are in \nprivate industry. The customers of health and community elder care \nservices are the purchasers and with few exceptions (Wilson \nforthcoming) these are state agencies rather than individuals. Users do \nnot therefore have commercial power over their providers. They may exit \nfrom the service but they cannot close it down by shifting their custom \nelsewhere. Their 'custom' has been placed with the provider by an \nagency setting up a block contract, or by a professional who has built \nup their care package from a devolved budget. Another difficulty arises \nin defining the service user, even when it is recognised that users and \ncustomers are not synonymous. Clients or patients may have different \nneeds and wishes from their informal carers or relatives. Professional \nsocial work staff have been trained to deal with value conflicts \n(CCETSW, 1990) of this type but not all find their learning easy to \napply. Health service staff have usually been trained to concentrate on \nthe patient and may find it hard to see their services in terms of \nsupport to informal carers as well (Atkin and Twigg, 1991). Front line \nstaff may still find it possible to concentrate on individual users and \ncarers, but managers must act with a wider range of service users in \nmind, ranging from service recipient to government ministers.  \n \nAccording to Normann (1991) successfully managed services will involve \nthe customers in more than simple co-production. For example customers \nwill help to define the ethos of the service and will enhance the self \nrespect of front line service providers. It is not yet clear how far \nthe NHS and Community Care Act 1990 has managed to move care provision \naway from professionally determined services towards needs led \nprovision (which could be seen as a first step in the direction of co-\nproduction). Initial evidence is conflicting (Ells, 1993; Stevenson and \nParsloe, 1993). However it is clear that if the management of co-\nproduction is to become a reality in community care, more research is \nneeded and new strategies which will empower all the co-producers will \nhave to be developed.  \n \nAnother problem arises from differences in social status between users \nand many of those who provide their services (Stacey, 1984). It is \neasier to envisage co-production of services as a partnership between \nprovider and user, or even as a new approach to enabling the consumer, \nwhen clients or users have same status as the providers. In the private \nsector customers are often of superior status. They decide on their own \neligibility and purchase the service if they like it. In catering, for \nexample, customers choose the restaurant or fast food outlet which \nsuits their needs at the time and eat their meals in the way they want. \nIn health and social care users are assessed, usually by trained \nprofessionals who consider themselves experts in the service they are \nproviding. The users are often socially disempowered - frail elders, \npeople with learning difficulties and those with mental health \nproblems. This disparity poses particular problems for the development \nof co-production. In private services the issue is one of managing \ncustomers (who can make or break the firm) and staff who are usually \nlower paid than their customers. In contrast, health and social \nservices managers may be accorded lower social status than some of \ntheir professional staff (though this is rapidly declining with the \nprofessionalisation of management), but they and their front line staff \nare financially and socially more powerful than most of their service \nusers. It is difficult to see those who are deemed socially inferior as \nequal partners let alone as superiors.  \n \nEthical issues \n \nDifferences in social status between users and providers also gives \nrise to ethical problems in the management of co-production. Management \ntheory, partly because it is based on private sector practice, has in \nthe past tended to neglect ethical questions. Co-production of services \nfor and with frail elders and other disadvantaged groups therefore \nraises a range of ethical issues which need to be investigated. In the \nfirst place ethical problems arise when older people are forced to \ncarry greater burdens of care for longer periods. These may be more \nserious if the increased burden leads to physical or mental ill health. \nSecondly, there may be cases where professionals can only achieve an \nextension of self care and informal care inputs by an unacceptable \ndegree of manipulation. If staff see themselves as providing a service \nnot coercing the client, there will be a clash of professional ethics. \nFinally, the management of co-production involves the recognition of \nthe contribution of service users and informal carers. However, there \nis no automatic reason why such recognition should increase \nprofessional respect for elders or give them more power. It might \ninstead lead to more sophisticated ways of exploiting their labour. \n \nWilding (1994) identifies the tension between seeing users as consumers \n(and so as potentially having adversarial rights to good service) and \nseeing them as partners. Partnership in human services has always been \na possible aim for providers, but equally there has always been the \npossibility of conflict. Teachers join with parents to encourage \nlearning but also examine and may fail children. In health and social \ncare professionals are backed by sanctions over wide areas of practice. \nThey may refuse treatment, commit users to mental hospital or take \nchildren into care. The management of co-production should  involve \nexplicitly recognising and managing these areas of tension, whereas at \npresent they may be fudged or ignored. In this area as in others, \nbeneficial changes will only be possible if conscious efforts are made \nto develop theory and practice which relate to the reality of managing \nservices in a mixed economy of welfare. \n \nConclusion \n \nEven without the 1990 NHS and Community Care Act there was a need to \nmake support services for the growing population of frail older people \nmore responsive as well as more effective (Smith, 1980). The \npresumption was that more responsive services would also be more \nefficient (Audit Commission, 1986). They would avoid duplication and \nolder people would feel better supported. This paper has called for \nfurther research in two related areas of services provision for older \npeople. The first is the understanding of self care and the second is \nthe management of co-production of care, including self care. \n \nThe paper has called attention to the significant contribution that \nolder people make to informal care in the community. Such care can be \ndivided into two branches - elders as caregivers and elders as self \ncarers. At present self care is wholly unrecognised whereas informal \ncare by elders has at least been mentioned in the NHS and community \nCare Act 1990. Under the Act informal carers are to be supported by \nlocal authorities (within financial limits). This is to be welcomed \nbut, as has been demonstrated, formal services are not well adapted to \nsupporting or enabling informal care.  \n \nBureaucratic and professional traditions in community services \nmanagement make it difficult for professionals to see themselves as co-\nproducers of care, even in an interagency context, let alone working \nwith informal and self carers. However the application of management \ntheory developed for the private services sector could go a long way to \nimproving the ability of managers in human service agencies to deliver \nuser-friendly services and to reduce staff burn out (Normann, 1991). \nAlthough co-production takes place on a day to day basis it is not \ndefined as such and managers do not see the management of user inputs \nto services as part of their role. \n \nThe types of management theory which are grounded in the experience of \nthe private sector are of limited use in human service agencies because \nthe users are not paying customers in the great majority of cases. They \nare also usually of lower social status than the service providers. \nThis difference increases the salience of ethical issues in the \nmanagement of co-production because the risk of exploitation of \ndisempowered users is greater than in the private sector. Research \nwhich can adapt and develop relevant theory to the needs of public, \nprivate and voluntary agencies that deal with vulnerable people is \nurgently needed. Managers will then have a more practical and enabling \nbody of theory to assist them in coping with the conflicts built into \ncommunity care policy. It will allow the expression of management \nobjectives and service standards in terms which are not derived either \nfrom manufacturing industry or from the private sector.  \n \n \n(1) I am grateful to the Editor for comments on an earlier draft of \nthis article. \n \n(2) Work on the Manager-User interface was funded under the DoH NHSME \nManagement of Community Care Project (see Wilson and Dockrell \n(forthcoming) for a description of methods).
