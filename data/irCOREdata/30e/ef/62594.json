Fluctuations in relative sea level during this interval are generally recorded as a \nseries of raised, highstand, shorelines and associated estuarine and marine sequences that are \npreserved in the coastal belt extending from the Firth of Forth northeastward to Stonehaven \nand beyond (Fig. 1). In contrast, little attention has been paid to the equivalent marine coastal \nrecord for which there is some indication for submerged, lowstand, rock platforms and \nfluviodeltaic deposits (Sissons 1974; Stoker et al. 1985), which do not feature in published \ncurves of Lateglacial\u2013Holocene change in relative sea level (cf. Hansom & McGlashan 2004 \nand references therein). Consequently, without considering the marine component of coastal \n  \n3\nlandscape change, current understanding of Lateglacial\u2013early Holocene coastal development \nis likely to remain both unbalanced and incomplete.  \n \nConnectivity across the coastal zone, since the early Holocene, is even less well \ndocumented. As with much of the North Sea region, the early mid-Holocene record of \nonshore eastern Scotland (about 8000 to 6000 14C yr BP: Mangerud et al. 1974) is initially \none of eustatic sea-level rise and coastal inundation, whereas marine regression down to \npresent-day sea level has occurred in this area since the late mid-Holocene. A dynamic \nsedimentary environment has been proposed in the adjacent North Sea since about 6000 14C \nyr BP on the basis of bedform development, such as sand ribbons and sand waves, and the \ncoarse-grained nature of the sea bed sediments (Owens 1981). Whether or not these bedforms \nare currently active is unclear; however, the main source of modern-day longshore sand \ntransport in nearshore areas such as St Andrews Bay and the Firth of Tay (Fig. 1) is envisaged \nto be the reworking of unconsolidated offshore Lateglacial\u2013Holocene sediment (Ferentinos & \nMcManus 1981; Hansom 1999). By way of contrast, most of the fluviatile input to the coastal \nzone is presently trapped within the estuaries of the Forth and Tay (Gatliff et al. 1994).  \n \nIn this paper, we present the results of investigations in the coastal area offshore \neastern Scotland (Fig. 1), including insights into Lateglacial base level and Holocene \nshoreface sediment dynamics. It has recently been suggested that climate variability during \nthe Holocene is characterised by as many as six distinct periods of rapid climate change \n(ranging from 200 to 1000 years duration), which may be correlated globally (Mayewski et al. \n2004). In the North Atlantic region, this variability includes fluctuations in the strength of \nwesterly winds. On this basis, we test the possible significance of these periods of rapid \nclimate change using the pattern of coastal sedimentation that we observe in the western \n  \n4\nNorth Sea. In particular, the observed cyclicity in sediment deposition is compared with \nchanges in North Atlantic current strength and periods of increased rainfall, which are \nintrinsically linked to a strong westerly circulation. \n \nRegional setting \n \nThe study area consists of a 15 to 30 km-wide coastal strip that extends from Fife Ness in the \nSW to Inverbervie in the NE (Fig. 1). Over most of this area the sea bed is relatively smooth \nand marked by coast-parallel contours that indicate a gentle seaward gradient (0.15\u20130.2\u00b0) \ndown to about 50 m below ordnance datum (OD). To the east of this zone, the sea bed \ndisplays a more varied topography that consists of shallow marine banks (\u2264-50 m OD, e.g. \nMarr Bank) interspersed with deeper (up to -90 m OD) erosional troughs. The irregular \nphysiography represents a relict ice-contact\/ice-marginal landsystem associated with the Main \nLate Devensian (Weichselian) Strathmore ice stream (Golledge & Stoker 2006); morainic \nridges of the Wee Bankie Formation (Fig. 2) comprise the shallow banks whereas the \nerosional troughs are part of a contemporaneous tunnel valley system. The Wee Bankie \nFormation is partially buried beneath a drape of shallow-water glacimarine (St Abbs \nFormation) and marine (Largo Bay Member of the Forth Formation) sediments, which were \ndeposited as relative sea level fell during deglaciation. All of these units are overlain by a \ndiscrete sediment wedge that shapes the smoother coastal zone (Figs 3, 4). This sediment \nwedge is defined as the St Andrews Bay Member of the Lateglacial\u2013Holocene Forth \nFormation (Stoker et al. 1985) (Fig. 2), and forms the focus of this paper. \n \nThe St Andrews Bay Member is mapped for a distance of about 70 km between Fife \nNess and Inverbervie (Fig. 1), and extending 10 to 20 km offshore. The unit occurs within a \n  \n5\npresent-day water depth range of 20 to 60 m below OD, with the shallow top of the unit \n(where observed) currently between about 25 and 40 m below OD. Regional seismic-\nstratigraphic mapping indicates that it forms a wedge-shaped deposit that locally exceeds 10 \nm thick (Figs 3, 4, 5), with the thickest part of the wedge (up to 17 m thick) extending \nseaward of the 30 m bathymetric contour. The landward extent of the unit remains unclear, \nlying beyond the western limit of the dataset (Fig. 1). The sediment wedge progrades \nseaward, but is also elongated parallel to the coastline. The upper boundary of the St Andrews \nBay Member is the present-day sea bed; its base is a downlap surface predominantly \nunderlain by Late Devensian till, glacimarine and marine sediment (Figs 4, 5). \n \nOn deep-tow boomer profiles, the internal acoustic reflection configuration of the St \nAndrews Bay Member is characterised by seaward-prograding, low-angle (<1.5\u00b0) clinoforms, \nwhich vary from oblique-parallel to sigmoid in geometry (Fig. 5). The topset zone is very thin \nand largely an area of erosion (Figs 4, 5). A consistent variation in clinoform geometry and \nseismic facies has enabled the subdivision of the St Andrews Bay Member into four informal \nunits (Figs 2, 4, 5, 6). On the basis of lithological and compositional data from the various \ncores that penetrate the sediment wedge, these units are herein referred to as lithozones \n(Salvador 1994), which is consistent with the general lithostratigraphic hierarchy established \nfor the Quaternary of the UK central North Sea (Stoker et al. 1985). The lithozones are \nassigned as L1 to L4 in ascending stratigraphic order (Fig. 2). \n \nThe geomorphology of the eastern Scottish coastal region records a legacy of the \nLateglacial to early Postglacial interplay between isostatic rebound and the eustatic rise in sea \nlevel associated with deglaciation. This legacy is manifested in a series of displaced \nshorelines that are currently preserved both above and below present-day sea level. The \n  \n6\nhighest raised shorelines are located at altitudes of up to +30 to +40 m above OD (Paterson et \nal. 1981), and developed as the land began to recover from glacio-isostatic depression \nbetween about 15100 and 13500 14C yr BP (Andrews & Dugdale 1970; Paterson 1974). At \nmaximum regression, large amounts of glaciofluvial sand and gravel prograded into the area \nof the Firth of Tay estuary (Fig. 1), and the elevation of the relative sea level minimum fell \nbelow present OD in the Firth of Tay and Firth of Forth estuaries. In both estuaries, a buried \nshelly gravel layer (including the Port Allen Gravel: Fig. 5) overlies a submerged rock \nplatform presently located between OD and \u201310 m OD (Sissons 1974; Paterson et al. 1981). \nThis platform is generally regarded as the Main Lateglacial Shoreline and is considered to \nhave formed during the Younger Dryas Stadial (Sissons, 1974), possibly at about 10800 14C \nyr BP (Paterson et al. 1981).  \n \nThe rate of land uplift in eastern Scotland remained greater than the rate of rise of \nglobal sea level until about 8400 14C yr BP (Jardine 1979) when, in common with much of the \nNorth Sea region, the rate of global eustacy overtook terrestrial rebound (Behre 2007). A \nprominent shoreline, the Main Postglacial Shoreline (up to +9 m OD), was formed at the \nmaximum of the postglacial transgression in eastern Scotland, which had probably ceased by \nabout 6000 14C yr BP (Paterson et al. 1981). Marine regression has largely dominated eastern \nScotland since the late mid-Holocene. \n  \nPalaeogeographic reconstruction of NW Europe (Shennan et al. 2000) indicates that \nthe study area has been part of a tidally-influenced marine basin since the Lateglacial \nInterstadial, concomitant with the initial penetration of warmer Atlantic currents into the \nNorwegian Trench and the northern and central North Sea (Thomson 1978; Lehman et al. \n1991; Lehman & Keigwin 1992; Veum et al. 1992; Ko\u00e7 et al. 1993; Brew 1996; Knudsen et \n  \n7\nal. 1996). Initially part of a restricted basin that incorporated the area of the Norwegian \nTrench and a western embayment located between the Dogger Bank and eastern Scotland\/NE \nEngland (Fig. 1B), it gradually expanded to the present-day North Sea as sea level rose. As a \nconsequence, the most significant changes in palaeogeography have occurred in the shallower \neastern and southern North Sea, including: 1) the connection between the North Sea and the \nEnglish Channel between about 9000 and 7000 cal. yr (c. 8300 to 6000 14C yr BP), though a \nfully marine environment may have existed only since 6000 cal. yr (c. 5400 14C yr BP) \n(Eisma et al. 1981; Lambeck 1995; Behre 2007); and, 2) the isolation at about 7000 cal. yr (c. \n6000 14C yr BP) and eventual submergence of the Dogger Bank (Fig. 1B) between 6000 and \n5000 cal. yr (c. 5400 to 4500 14C yr BP ) (Shennan et al. 2000; Behre 2007). Concomitant \nwith these changes was the development of the modern circulation pattern in the North Sea, \nwhich is mainly driven by the inflow of Atlantic waters (North Atlantic Drift Current; Fair \nIsle Current) between Scotland and Norway (Longva & Thorsnes 1997; Hebbeln et al. 2006) \n(Fig. 1B). This inflow stimulates a counter-clockwise circulation in the North Sea, with part \nof the water mass following depth contours in the northern North Sea, whereas other parts \nflow around the entire basin where its properties are modified by freshwater input from \nnumerous large rivers (e.g. Thames, Rhine) as well as mixing with Channel Water. The \noutflows combine in the Skagerrak (between Denmark and Norway), further incorporating \nBaltic outflow, to form the northward flowing Norwegian Coastal Current. Offshore eastern \nScotland, the coastal zone is bathed by southerly flowing Scottish Coastal Water, which is \npart of the basinwide system of coast-parallel currents (Harland & Long 1996; Evans et al. \n2002; Gyllencreutz et al. 2006). Harland & Long (1996) report the existence of Scottish \nCoastal Water off NE England from about 8000 14C yr BP.  \n \n  \n8\nThis oceanographic pattern is strongly influenced by atmospheric circulation, with \nstrong westerly winds enhancing the currents whereas easterly winds dampen the currents \n(Hebbeln et al. 2006). As much of the North Sea is shallow (<100 m) it is characterised by \nhigh tidal- and wave-energy levels, with the tidal stream aligned parallel to the coastline \n(Pantin 1991; Gatliff et al. 1994). Mean spring tidal near-bottom current velocities together \nwith storm-wave induced currents have the capacity to erode sediments from medium sand \ngrade to gravel grade (Owens 1981; Pantin 1991). It has been demonstrated that shoreface \nreworking in response to tide- and wave-induced currents is an important element of the \nHolocene sediment dynamic regime along the western North Sea coastline (Ferentinos & \nMcManus 1981; Shennan et al. 2003). Offshore eastern Scotland, the observed pattern of sand \nand gravel sea floor bedforms implies a predominantly northerly sediment transport path \n(Kenyon & Stride 1970; Stride 1973; Owens 1981) (Fig. 1B). This is consistent with the \nstrongest tidal flow being associated with the ebb tidal current (Kenyon & Stride 1970; Lee & \nRamster 1981).   \n  \nMethods and material \n \nThis study combines high-resolution seismic reflection data with core information collected \nby the British Geological Survey (BGS) as part of their offshore reconnaissance Quaternary \nmapping programme. The seismic reflection data was acquired using a high-frequency 6 kV \ndeep-tow boomer source, which has a sub-sea bed penetration of up to 100 m and a vertical \nresolution of 0.25\u20131.0 m. Interpretation of the data was based on established concepts of \nseismic reflection, facies and attribute analysis as defined by Mitchum et al. (1977) and \nSangree & Widmier (1977). Conversion of two-way travel time to metres is based on an \nacoustic velocity of 1500 ms-1. Geological calibration of the seismic data utilised information \n  \n9\nfrom three cores: BGS vibrocores 56-03\/586 and 587, and BGS borehole 74\/15 (Figs 1, 2; \nTable 1). These cores have been analysed in terms of their lithology, sedimentary structure, \ncomposition and microfaunal content. The macrofauna of a distinctive shell hash in core 56-\n03\/587 was also examined. Material from all three cores was submitted for radiocarbon \ndating. \n \nGraphic logs of the cores were produced from macro- and microscopic examination of \nthe sediments (Fig. 6). For the latter, twenty two samples were analysed for their petrography \nand composition. The samples were prepared as grain mount thin sections and examined \nusing a standard Zeiss petrological microscope. The petrography of these sediments is \npresented in Table 2. Modal compositional data were calculated, from point counting of grain \nmounts, as volumetric proportions of categories of detrital grains as recommended by \nDickinson & Suczek (1979). Counts per sample are listed in Table 3 and plotted graphically \non Figs 7, 8, 9, and include the following categories of detrital grains (after Dickinson & \nSuczek 1979): stable quartz grains (Q) including both mono- (Qm) and polycrystalline (Qp) \nquartz; monocrystalline feldspar (F) grains including plagioclase (Pl) and K-feldspar (Ksp); \nunstable polycrystalline lithic fragments (L) of three main types, namely volcanic (Lv), \nmetamorphic (Lm) and sedimentary (Ls) rock fragments. The total lithic component (Ltotal) \nof the sediments represents the sum of the unstable lithic fragments (L) plus stable \npolycrystalline quartz (Qp) grains. The key aspects of the petrographic and compositional \ndata are summarised in Table 4. \n \nSixteen samples were analysed for their foraminiferal and ostracod content (Tables 5, \n6), with specimens picked from dry residues (>72 mg). Up to a maximum of 300 specimens \n  \n10\nwere counted for the foraminifera. In contrast, the whole population of ostracods was \nidentified as the counts were much less than 300 specimens.  \n \nWell-preserved, non-abraded, marine shells and benthic foraminifera were used to \nobtain accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon ages (Table 7). Whole single valves \nof Arctica islandica and Macoma calcarea were recovered from core 56-03\/587, whereas the \nbenthic foramimifera Ammonia batavus was sampled from core 56-03\/586 and borehole \n74\/15. A minimum of 20 mg of foraminifer was picked out for each sample. All of these \nsamples were subsequently prepared for dating at the Natural Environment Research Council \nRadiocarbon Laboratory at East Kilbride, UK. All offshore 14C dates reported here are \ncorrected with a marine reservoir age of 405\u00b140 yr (Harkness 1983). As most of the \npreviously published dates specific to the study area are given in 14C yr BP, this standard is \nretained for direct comparison between onshore and offshore data. However, for correlation of \nour data to global events (see Discussion), our new radiocarbon ages have been calibrated to \ncalendar years (Table 7) based on the Fairbanks0107 calibration curve (Fairbanks et al. 2005). \nThe chronostratigraphic subdivision of the Holocene is based on Mangerud et al. (1974). \n \nResults \n \nThe seismic, lithological and palaeontological characteristics of lithozones L1, L3 and L4 are \nsummarised below; in the absence of any core material for L2, it is described only in terms of \nits seismic facies. The radiocarbon chronological data are presented at the end of the section.  \n \nLithozone 1 \n \n  \n11\nSeismic character. \u2013 This unit is up to 9 m thick and is acoustically well layered, with an \ninternal oblique-parallel (sensu Mitchum et al. 1977) reflection configuration. Downlapping \nclinoforms dip seaward at angles of up to 1.0\u20131.2\u00b0. The upper bounding surface is everywhere \nerosional, and presently lies at about 30 m below sea level. The youngest clinoforms are \ntruncated and locally scoured at the contact with L2. The topset zone is nowhere preserved, \nand an erosional unconformity separates L1 from the overlying sediment veneer (most \nprobably L4) (Figs 4, 5). The seaward limit of L1 is shown in Fig. 3B.  \n \nLithology. \u2013 A 0.7 m-thick section of L1 was sampled in core 56-03\/587, between 1.38 and \n2.08 m below sea bed (Fig. 6). This consists of dark greyish brown (2.5Y 4\/2) (Munsell \ncolour code), upward-fining, medium to very fine-grained sand and coarse silt. The sediment \nis composed predominantly of quartz, lithic fragments and plagioclase with subordinate minor \nand accessory minerals (Figs 7, 8A; Tables 2, 3, 4). Bioclastic material is rare (see below) \n(Figs 7D, 8A; Table 3). The upward-fining texture represents a distribution grading. The \ncontact with the overlying lithozone, L4, is marked by a sharp erosional surface. \n \nPalaeontology. \u2013 Foraminifera are extremely rare with only a few specimens of Elphidium \nexcavatum clavatum, Buccella frigida, Cibicides lobatulus, Elphidium incertum and \nQuinquloculina seminulum recorded in core 56-03\/587 (Table 5). Similarly, L1 was almost \ndevoid of ostracods, with only a single recovered species of Cytheropteron nodosum (Table \n6). A large single valve of the bivalve Macoma calcarea was sampled near the base of core \n56-03\/587. \n \nLithozone 2 \n \n  \n12\nSeismic character. \u2013 This unit is up to 7 m thick and is acoustically well layered, with an \ninternal sigmoid-oblique tangential reflection configuration (Figs 4, 5). Downlapping \nclinoforms commonly dip seaward at angles of 0.25\u20130.5\u00b0, though an angle of about 1.1\u00b0 is \nobserved on boomer profile 80-03\/14 (Fig. 5). The lower boundary is an erosional contact that \nnot only truncates clinoforms within the underlying L1 lithozone, but also erodes into the St \nAbbs Formation (Figs 4, 5). The upper boundary is largely conformable with L3 in the \nclinoform zone, though there is a hint of erosional truncation at the distal edge of the unit. The \ntopset zone has been largely removed by later erosion. The seaward limit of L2 is shown in \nFig. 3B. \n \nLithozone 3 \n \nSeismic character. \u2013 This unit is up to 10 m thick and is mainly acoustically structureless and \nopaque, though weak oblique tangential reflections are sporadically observed (Figs 4, 5). \nClinoforms commonly dip seaward at angles of 0.25\u20130.5\u00b0. A flat-lying bottomset zone is \nlocally preserved (Fig. 5). The lower boundary is predominantly conformable with the \nunderlying L2 lithozone, though localised erosion is observed. The upper boundary appears to \nbe largely conformable with L4 in the clinoform zone, but on boomer profile 80-03\/14 the \nupper bottomset surface forms a downlap surface for L4 (Fig. 5). The topset zone has been \nlargely removed by later erosion. The seaward limit of L3 is shown in Fig. 3B. \n \nLithology. \u2013 The distal end of L3 was sampled between 3.5 and 5.5 m below sea bed in \nborehole 74\/15, although sample recovery was poor. The borehole proved a 2.0 m-thick \nsection of dark olive grey (5Y 3\/2), very fine-grained micaceous sand to coarse silt (Fig. 6), \ncomposed predominantly of quartz, plagioclase and mica (combined biotite and muscovite), \n  \n13\nwith subordinate lithic fragments and accessory minerals (Figs 7, 8B; Tables 2, 3, 4). The \nbioclastic content is low (see below) (Figs 7D, 8B). The poor sample recovery precludes any \nobservation on the sedimentary structure of L3, though the grain size and composition are \nfairly uniform throughout the lithozone. In borehole 74\/15, L3 rests with angular \nunconformity on dark greyish brown (10YR 4\/2) glacimarine clay of the underlying St Abbs \nFormation; the nature of the upper contact with L4 was not observed in the borehole.  \n \nPalaeontology. \u2013 The foraminiferal assemblage is low in content and in diversity (Table 5). \nThe preserved assemblage is dominated by Ammonia batavus and E. excavatum, clavatum \nwith rare specimens including C. lobatulus, E. incertum and Bulimina marginata. A single \nspecimen of Bulimina elongata was observed in sample MPA55505 in the upper part of the \nunit. The ostracod content of L3 is restricted to a single specimen of Elofsonella concinna \nrecovered from the base of the unit (Table 6). A single specimen of the gastropod Turritella \ncommunis was observed near the base of the core. \n \nLithozone 4 \n \nSeismic character. \u2013 This unit is up to 8 m thick and is acoustically layered, with an internal \nsigmoid-oblique reflection configuration (Figs 4, 5). Downlapping clinoforms commonly dip \nseaward at angles of 0.25\u20130.5\u00b0. The lower boundary is predominantly conformable with the \nunderlying L3 lithozone, though downlap onto L3 bottomsets is locally developed. The upper \nboundary is the sea bed. A thin (<2 m thick) topset zone is preserved and extends landward \nfrom about 35 m to 25 m (at the landward end of the seismic profiles) below OD. The base of \nthe topset zone has eroded into the underlying L1 to L3 lithozones. The seaward limit of L4 is \nshown in Fig. 3B. \n  \n14\n \nLithology. \u2013 Lithozone L4 has been sampled in all three cores in this study: from sea bed to \n5.9 m in core 56-03\/586; from sea bed to 1.38 m in core 56-03\/587; and from sea bed to 3.5 m \nin borehole 74\/15 (Figs 2, 6). Core 56-03\/586 and borehole 74\/15 tested the clinoform facies, \nwhereas core 56-03\/587 penetrated the topset facies. \n \nThe clinoform facies consists of dark greyish brown (2.5Y 3\/2\u201310YR 4\/2), moderately \nsorted, coarse silt to very fine-grained sand, which is composed predominantly of quartz, \nplagioclase and lithic fragments, with subordinate mica (combined biotite and muscovite) and \nother accessory minerals (Figs 7, 8D\u2013E, 9B; Tables 2, 3, 4). Bioclastic material occurs \nthroughout this facies, with sporadic discrete laminations (<1 cm thick) rich in shell \nfragments. In borehole 74\/15, the poor sample recovery precludes any observation of \nsedimentary structure in L4; however, in core 56-03\/586 crude decimetre- to metre-scale \nbedding is interpreted on the basis of observed grain size variation within the section, and \nreveals an alternation between beds of coarse silt and very fine-grained sand (Fig. 6). The \nnature of the contact between the beds is not preserved but is inferred to be sharp, on the basis \nof the distinct bimodal grain size. \n \nThe topset facies is represented in core 56-03\/587 by an upwards-fining sequence of \nsand that overlies a sharp and erosive base cut into the underlying L1 lithozone (Fig. 6). The \nbase of the upwards-fining sequence is marked by a 0.15 m-thick shell hash that overlies the \nunconformity, and consists of both fragmented and whole bivalve shells, gastropod shells and \nworm tubes (see below), which are aligned subhorizontal defining a planar parallel \nlamination. The shell material is set within a matrix of very dark grey (5Y 3\/1), medium to \nfine, moderately sorted sand that grades upwards into very fine-grained sand to coarse silt \n  \n15\ngrade material at the top of the core. The sand is composed predominantly of quartz with \ncommon lithic fragments and plagioclase, with subordinate mica and accessory minerals (Figs \n7, 8C; Tables 2 , 3, 4). Bioclastic material occurs throughout this facies (see below), though \nthere is an increase in content below 0.65 m depth.  \n \nPalaeontology. \u2013 Foraminifera were recovered from all three cores, though core 56-03\/586 \nrecords the greatest variation. In this core, diversity is low at the base (5.8 m) but increases up \nthe core (Table 5). A. batavus is dominant throughout the section, commonly occurring in \nflood proportions (>75% of the total assemblage). Rare B. marginata is found up to a depth of \n4.0 m, where it is replaced by B. elongata. Specimens of Eggerelloides scaber and Haynesina \nanglica are rare to frequent at 2.6 m and above. Comparable faunas are also recorded in core \n56-03\/587 and borehole 74\/15 (Table 5). The sporadic occurrence of species such as E. \nexcavatum clavatum, Elphidium bartletti and Haynesina orbiculare in all three cores may be \nindicative of reworking from the glacigenic St Abbs or Wee Bankie formations, which are \ndominated by these taxa (cf. Gregory et al. in Thomson 1978). \n \nLithozone L4 also has the largest assemblage of ostracods, though diversity remains \nlow, and none of the assemblages are especially rich (Table 6). As with the foraminifera, core \n56-03\/586 records an upwards increase in diversity with E. concinna, Robertsonites \ntuberculatus, Pterygocythereis jonesii and Palmoconcha guttata being most common. The \nfauna in core 56-03\/587 and borehole 74\/15 is more patchy, but essentially similar, and also \nincludes Hirschmannia viridis and Leptocythere psammophila. Rare specimens of Arctic \nspecies such as Finmarchinella angulata, , Rabimilis mirabilis, Hemicytherura clathrata, in \nborehole 74\/15 are probably reworked.  \n \n  \n16\nA diverse macrofaunal assemblage was recovered from the shell hash in core 56-\n03\/587, between 1.3 and 1.35 m, which includes the serpulid polychaete Ditrupa arietina, \ntogether with abundant gastropods and molluscs. The gastropods include Acteon tornatalis, \nCingula semicostata, Cylichna cylindracea, Oenopota turricula, Retusa obtusa and T. \ncomunis. The mollusc assemblage consists of Abra nitida, Acanthocardia echinata, Arctica \nislandica, Chlamys opercularis, Nucula cf. nucleus,and Venus casina. \n \nRadiocarbon dating \n \nA total of six samples (bivalve molluscs and benthic foraminifera) have been AMS 14C dated \nfrom lithozones 1, 3 and 4 (Fig. 6, Table 7). The dates indicate that the cored sequence \nroughly spans the last 10500 14C yr BP (ca. 12500 cal. yr). Although the seismic and \nlithofacies character of the lithozones indicates some degree of reworking, which implies that \nthe dates are maximum ages, the well preserved and non-abraded nature of the sample \nspecimens together with their sequential increase in age down-sequence suggests that any \nreworking was largely penecontemporaneous with deposition. Thus, we regard the \nchronology to be a reasonable indicator of the time of deposition. \n \nIn core 56-03\/587, an age of 10543\u00b155 14C yr BP was determined from the M. \ncalcarea valve from a depth of 2.0 m in lithozone L1. In lithozone L3, ages of 4959\u00b154 and \n4944\u00b153 14C yr BP were determined from A. batavus in borehole 74\/15, at a depth of 5.5 m \nand from the interval 3.5\u20135.0 m, respectively. For lithozone L4, ages of 2224\u00b154 and \n2219\u00b154 14C yr BP were determined from A. batavus in core 56-03\/586, at depths of 2.55\u2013\n2.65 m and 2.27\u20132.4 m respectively, whereas in core 56-03\/587, an age of 1377\u00b153 14C yr BP \nwas determined from an A. islandica valve from the shell hash at the base of the core.  \n  \n17\n \nInterpretation \n \nThe main characteristics and interpretation of the deposits of the four lithozones are \nsummarised in Table 8; the interpretation of L2 is based on a comparison with L3 and L4. \nFrom a cursory inspection of the geophysical profiles (Figs 4, 5), it might be inferred that the \nSt Andrews Bay Member represents a single, composite, prograding lowstand wedge (e.g. \nStoker et al. 1985; Stoker 1987); however, this study reveals significant differences between \nL1 and the overlying lithozones. Moreover, the stratigraphic range of the St Andrews Bay \nMember (Younger Dryas to Late Holocene) implied by the radiocarbon dating is far more \nextensive than previously reported (Stoker et al. 1985). When correlated to the local sea level \ncurve (Fig. 10), this has major implications for the interpretation of the depositional setting of \nthe lithozones (see below).  \n \nThe contrast between L1 and L2\u20134 is demonstrated below through reference to their \nseismic facies, petrography and sand composition, and microfaunal assemblage. Collectively, \nthese attributes form the basis for the interpretation of depositional environments. \n \nSeismic facies \n \nSeismic facies analysis indicates a switch from an oblique-parallel clinoform profile in L1 to a \npredominantly sigmoid-oblique clinoform profile in L2 to L4, which define a more concave-\nupward stratal configuration (Figs 4, 5). An oblique progradational reflection pattern is \ngenerally interpreted to represent a relatively high-energy sedimentary regime, characterised \nby some combination of relatively high sediment supply, slow to no basin subsidence, and a \n  \n18\nstillstand of sea level that enables sediment bypass or scour of the upper depositional surface \n(Mitchum et al. 1977). Although all lithozones display an oblique clinoform profile to some \ndegree, the depositional dip in L1, albeit low, is twice that of L2 to L4. A shallower \ndepositional dip and sigmoid clinoform profile may imply a lower energy regime for L2 to \nL4; however, the similarity in lithology between L1, L3 and L4 might suggest that the energy \ndifferential was not large. This is significant given that the AMS 14C radiocarbon dates \ncombined with the sea-level curve indicate that L1 was deposited during a lowstand \nassociated with the Younger Dryas Stadial, whereas L3 and L4 (and most probably L2) were \nlaid down during the mid- to late Holocene highstand (Fig. 10). The present confinement of a \nthin topset zone to L4 supports the concept that a high-energy erosional regime has persisted \nadjacent to the coastline since the Younger Dryas Stadial albeit responding to two very \ndifferent depositional mechanisms, as is discussed further below. \n \nPetrography and sand composition \n \nPetrographic observation and modal compositional data show that there are significant \ndifferences between the sediments of L1 and those of L3 and L4 (Tables 2, 3, 4).  In general, \nthe sediment in L1 is coarser grained and more lithic-rich than the sediments from L3 and L4. \nThe medium- to fine-grained sand in L1 is clearly discriminated by its higher polycrystalline \nquartz (Fig. 7A), volcanic (Fig. 7B) and metamorphic (Fig. 7C) lithic clast components, and \nlower bioclastic (Fig. 7D) and mica (biotite and muscovite, Fig. 7E, F, respectively) content. \nThe higher monocrystalline quartz, biotite and muscovite contents exhibited by the fine-\ngrained sands and coarse silts of L3 and L4 are consistent with an increasing textural maturity \nof the sediment (trend lines on Fig. 7A, C) with time and concentration of detrital \nphyllosilicate minerals within the finer grained silty sediments.  \n  \n19\n \nThe compositional differences between the lithozones are further evident when the \ndata are plotted as a series of multicomponent variation diagrams (Fig. 8). The sands of L1 \npossess detrital phyllosilicate (biotite, muscovite, chlorite) and heavy mineral (garnet, opaque \nminerals, amphibole, epidote) contents of close to or below 1% (Fig. 8A). In contrast, the \nmore micaceous sediments of L3 are distinguished by the slightly \u2018humped\u2019 section of the \npattern corresponding to the detrital phyllosilicate minerals (Fig. 8B). Although the fine sands \nand coarse silts of L4 show some compositional differences between the cores that penetrated \nthis lithozone (see Fig. 7) they exhibit a very similar pattern on Fig. 8. This suggests that \nvariations within L4 probably reflect the variation in grain size and, therefore, a change from \na more proximal (56-03\/587) to distal (56-03\/586 and 74\/15) depositional environment. \n \nThe sands of L1 contain a significant metamorphic component (rock fragments, \ngarnet, staurolite, chloritoid) indicating that the source terrane included the metamorphic \nrocks of the Dalradian Southern Highland Group, which are exposed to the north and west of \nStonehaven (Fig. 1). Altered, very fine-grained volcanic rock fragments are inferred to be \nderived from the Late Silurian to Early Devonian volcanic rocks (e.g. Montrose Volcanic \nFormation) which crop out in the Montrose area (Fig. 1). These components (albeit reduced \npercentage) are also recognised as heavy minerals in L3 and L4 (Fig. 7B, C, Tables 2, 3), \nwhere their occurrence suggests that either the same provenance was being sourced, or that \nthe sands of L1 were being reworked. Evidence for some reworking of L1 during the \ndeposition of L4 is provided by Fig. 9A. The slightly coarser-grained sand at the base of L4 is \ncompositionally similar to the underlying sand. The upwards (stratigraphically) increase in \nmonocrystalline quartz, biotite and muscovite, and concomitant decrease in the more unstable \ndetrital components (such as polycrystalline quartz and metamorphic lithic clasts) are \n  \n20\nconsistent with the increasing maturity of the sediment and overall decrease in grain size of \nthe sediments within this fining upwards sequence. Similar stratigraphical variations in \nsediment composition can also be identified within L4 (Fig. 9B) indicating that the reworking \nalso occurred during the deposition of a single lithozone. \n \nMicrofaunal assemblages \n \nLate Pleistocene and Holocene benthic foraminifera and ostracods are present throughout \nlithozones L1, L3 and L4 of the St Andrews Bay Member. Foraminifera are more common \nthan ostracods (Tables 5, 6), although richness and diversity are generally low in both \nmicrofossil groups. Despite this, there is a clear change from a High Arctic assemblage in L1 \nto low Boreal\u2013Lusitanian (sensu Feyling-Hanssen 1955) sub-littoral microfaunal assemblages \nin L3 and L4 (Table 8).  \n \nOf the foraminifera species recorded in L1, E. excavatum clavatum and B. frigida are \ncharacteristic of cold, shallow water conditions, such as those associated with the Lateglacial \ninterval (e.g. Holmes 1977; Thomson 1978; Knudsen 1985; Jensen & Knudsen 1988; Merritt \net al. 1995; Eir\u00edksson et al. 2004). This assemblage is thus considered to be pre-Holocene, \nwhich is consistent with the Younger Dryas Stadial age determined for L1 (Tables 7, 8). \n \nIn contrast to L1, higher diversity foraminiferal assemblages are preserved in L3 and \nL4, dominated by A. batavus (Table 5), which is a temperate species that is generally regarded \nas a good indicator of postglacial conditions. Its modern distribution around Britain is in \nbrackish (salinity of 22\u2030) to fully marine (35\u2030) settings, with water depths ranging from \n<10 to 60 m (Murray 1992). The presence of B. elongata, B. marginata, E. scaber and H. \n  \n21\nanglica are further indicators of a temperate, sub-littoral environmental regime, with the latter \ntwo species having a preference for brackish marine salinities.  \n \nWhereas L3 was almost devoid of ostracods in the samples analysed, increased \nnumbers and diversity characterise L4 (Table 6). The most abundant species listed in Table 6, \nincluding E. concinna and S. bradii, are commonly found in the present-day North Sea \n(Athersuch et al. 1989), in water depths from 5 to 200 m. By way of contrast, H. viridis and L. \npsammophila are common species around the coast of Britain in brackish (outer estuarine) to \nmarine settings (Athersuch et al. 1989).  \n \nDepositional environment \n \nLithozone 1. \u2013 On the basis of its relatively coarse-grained and lithic-rich nature, its sparse \nhigh-arctic microfauna, and an age determination of 10543\u00b155 14C yr BP, we interpret L1 to \nhave been deposited as a lowstand fluvio-deltaic wedge during the Younger Dryas Stadial. \nThe offshore limits of L1 (Fig. 3A) are consistent with the wedges having been sourced from \nrivers draining the east and northeast Scottish hinterland; principally the River Tay catchment \nsystem in the south, and the North Esk\u2013South Esk catchment system in the north, which \nenters into the North Sea from the embayed area of the coastline to the north and south of \nMontrose (Fig. 1). Although the wedge has been subsequently eroded, its top - the delta plain \n\u2013 would have been located no deeper than about -30 m OD (its present erosional level) (Figs \n4, 5). From this, we infer a fall in relative sea level to between -20 and -30 OD during the \ndeposition of L1 (Fig. 10).  \n \n  \n22\nLithozones 2\u20134. \u2013 On the basis of seismic facies analysis, we suggest that L2 displays \ncommon attributes (clinoform profile and dip) with L3 and L4, and thus that these wedges \nshare a common origin. The radiocarbon dates indicate a mid- to late Holocene age for L3 and \nL4, which is not inconsistent with the microfaunal and macrofaunal (in L4) assemblages that \nreveal a temperate sub-littoral environment, with relative sea level slightly higher than the \npresent-day (Fig. 10). Intriguingly, the majority of the foraminifera and ostracods are \neuryhaline and tolerant of brackish marine conditions, which may reflect some freshwater \ninput. Whilst there are compositional similarities between the sediments of L1 and those of \nL3 and L4, the latter reveal a greater textural maturity that is more consistent with marine \nreworking of L1-type sediments, in response to the change in hydrodynamic conditions. \nAlthough some fluviatile input cannot be discounted, we interpret the L2\u2013L4 sequence in \nterms of a prograding series of highstand shoreface wedges largely derived by marine \nreworking of older Quaternary sediments, including L1. Arguably, the landward (topset) part \nof each wedge has been eroded during the succeeding phase of shoreface development.  In \nFig. 3A, the limits of L2 to L4 imply both a seaward progradation as well as a longshore (to \nthe NE) migration. This is consistent with the direction of sand transport offshore NE \nScotland as deduced by bedforms (Kenyon & Stride 1970) (Fig. 1B). \n \nDiscussion   \n \nAny attempt to understand Lateglacial\u2013Holocene landscape development in eastern Scotland \nhas to take into consideration the coastal marine record of change. Our study has revealed that \na highly dynamic sedimentary regime has prevailed along the eastern Scottish seaboard \nduring and since deglaciation of the last British Ice Sheet. The coastal marine landform record \nis dominated by the sequential growth of a prograding sediment wedge, initiated as a \n  \n23\nlowstand fluvio-delta deposit (L1) during the Younger Dryas Stadial, with growth sustained \nby episodic mid- to late Holocene shoreface progradation (L2\u2212L4). On the basis of \nradiocarbon age data, we infer a hiatus between L1 and L2, though its duration remains \nuncertain. In Fig. 10, the lithozones are incorporated within an event stratigraphy that places \ntheir timing of formation in relation to changes in relative sea level, North Sea hydrography \nand palaeogeography, and North East Atlantic oceanography. In the following discussion, this \nevent-stratigraphic framework provides the basis for assessing (1) Lateglacial \npalaeogeography and base level, and (2) the factors controlling Holocene shoreface \nprogradation off eastern Scotland.   \n \nLateglacial palaeogeography and base level \n \nThe nature and age of L1 provide unequivocal evidence for the existence of a lowstand fluvio-\ndeltaic wedge occupying the present-day coastal embayments seaward of the Firth of Tay \nestuary and Montrose (Figs 1, 3), during the Younger Dryas Stadial (Fig. 10). From mapping \nand interpretation of the seismic data, we suggest that the seaward edge of the former delta \nplain may have been at a present depth of about -20 to -30 m OD. Consequently, the coastline \nof eastern Scotland, between Fife Ness and Inverbervie (Fig. 1), would have been 5 to 10 km \neast of the modern coastline. The seaward limit of L1 depicted in Fig. 3 gives a maximum \napproximation of the Younger Dryas Stadial coastline. \n \nElsewhere, a 600 m-wide submarine rock platform has been located offshore to the SE \nof North Berwick (Fig. 1) by diver observation and on echo-sounder records where it occurs \ndown to a depth of \u201327 m below OD (Eden et al. 1969). This platform rises gently from \u201327 \nm OD to a shoreline at \u201318 m OD; the latter has been equated by Sissons (1974) with the \n  \n24\nMain Lateglacial Shoreline. A deeper lowstand base level is also supported by onshore \nborehole evidence that has revealed buried channels around the Firth of Tay region that are \nincised into the essentially planar Main Lateglacial Shoreline to a depth of \u201329 m below OD \n(Paterson et al. 1981). The River Tweed in NE England is also reported to have cut channels \ndown to a depth of \u201320 m below OD during the same interval (Rhind 1972). This base level \nprobably corresponds with the maximum readvance of ice caps during the Younger Dryas \nStadial (Sissons 1974; Jardine 1979; Paterson et al. 1981). \n \nThe significance of this observation is that the lowstand wedge, together with \npublished evidence for Lateglacial marine erosion in eastern Scotland (Eden et al. 1969; \nSissons 1974), suggests a relative sea level of -20 to -30 m OD for the Younger Dryas Stadial. \nThis base level is at least 10 m lower than previously published estimates of relative sea level \nin this interval for this region (Paterson et al. 1981; Sissons 1983; Shennan & Horton 2002; \nHansom & McGlashan 2004; Shennan et al. 2006).  \n \nMid- to late Holocene shoreface progradation \n \nThe sedimentary regime offshore eastern Scotland underwent a significant change during the \nearly to early mid-Holocene in response to: (1) the rise in eustatic sea level; and, (2) the onset \nof the modern North Sea circulation pattern (Fig. 10). The interval between about 10000 and \n6000 14C yr BP is marked by an overall rising sea level and the development of a \ntransgressive systems tract in the North Sea region, which inundated eastern Scotland beyond \nthe present coast from about 8000 to 7500 14C yr BP (Jardine 1979; Paterson et al. 1981). The \nerosion of lithozone L1 may have been instigated during transgression. Since about 7500 14C \n  \n25\nyr BP, estuarine silts and clays have accumulated along the inundated coastal fringe (Paterson \net al. 1981), whereas a sub-littoral environment has prevailed in the study area. \n \nIn the early mid-Holocene, the changing palaeogeography of the North Sea region \n(opening of English Channel; isolation and submergence of Dogger Bank) (Eisma et al. 1981; \nLambeck 1995; Shennan et al. 2000; Behre 2007) combined with the increased inflow from \nthe NE Atlantic Ocean (Lehman & Keigwin 1992; Harland & Howe 1995; Longva & \nThorsnes 1997; Klitgaard-Kristensen et al. 2001; Hebbeln et al. 2006) (Fig. 10) led to the \nestablishment of the modern circulation system. This generated strong coastal currents around \nthe North Sea, including Scottish coastal water (Harland & Long 1996; Evans et al. 2002) \n(Fig. 1A). Thus, our interpretation of L2 to L4 as a prograding series of highstand shoreface \nwedges is consistent with a tidally-influenced coastal zone.  \n \nIn order to evaluate the factors responsible for controlling the development of the \nshoreface wedges, a number of key features must be considered: \n \n\u2022 At the scale of the lithozone (L2 to L4), each seismically distinct depositional package \nrepresents a temporally separate pulse of sedimentation that may last for at least 1000 \nyears (e.g. L4: 2224\u00b154 to 1377\u00b153 14C yr BP: extent of recent activity \u2013 if any \u2013 is \nuncertain), and may be separated by intervals in excess of 2000 years (e.g. L3 and L4) \n(Fig. 10).  \n\u2022 Each lithozone may itself consist of higher-order units that possibly represent component \nbeds or bedsets. In L4, stratigraphic superposition is revealed by variation in sediment \ncomposition in core 56-03\/586 (Fig. 9B), particularly with respect to monocrystalline \nquartz. \n  \n26\n\u2022 The microfaunal assemblage recovered from L3 and L4 indicate that although salinity was \nprobably close to fully marine, the presence of brackish marine conditions from time to \ntime can be postulated. \n \nFrom these observations, we infer: (1) that higher-order depositional events \n(beds\/bedsets) are superimposed on a longer-term cyclicity (lithozone); and, (2) that salinity \nduring these depositional cycles may have been periodically diluted by freshwater input. \nBearing in mind that the general depositional environment offshore eastern Scotland is \npredominantly influenced by tidal currents, it would seem sensible to consider the cyclical \nnature of sedimentation in relation to the strength of Atlantic inflow. According to Harland & \nHowe (1995), fluctuations in the relative proportions of dinoflagellate cyst populations \nindicate significant oceanographic changes along the Atlantic margin of NW Britain between \n8000 and 6000 14C yr BP, and between 4000 and 2000 14C yr BP, with increased strength of \nthe North Atlantic Drift Current during these intervals. It thus seems reasonable to assume \nthat Atlantic inflow into the North Sea was similarly increased at these times. Although no \ndirect correlation between these events and the deposition of L2 to L4 can be made at this \ntime, in part due to the rather general dating of the dinoflagellate cyst record, the proposed \nduration of these oceanographic events is comparable to the longer term cyclicity envisaged \nfor each lithozone.  \n \nAs the North Atlantic Drift Current is a wind-driven extension of the North Atlantic \nCurrent, any strengthening of the current would coincide with an increase in the strength of \nthe westerly winds blowing across the North Atlantic (Kershaw, 2000). Moreover, it has long \nbeen established that a strong westerly circulation is linked to phases of increased rainfall \nover NW Europe (Walker & Bliss 1932). Thus, it is tempting to suggest that this may lead to \n  \n27\nincreased freshwater input to the coastal zone via rivers and estuaries thereby reducing \nnearshore salinity as recorded by the microfauna offshore eastern Scotland. Mayewski et al. \n(2004) have recently proposed at least six major global intervals of rapid climate change \nwithin the Holocene; these are: 9000\u20138000; 6000\u20135000; 4200\u20133800; 3500\u20132500; 1200\u20131000; \nand, 600\u2013150 cal. yr. All of these intervals, excepting the 600\u2013150 cal. yr, are associated with \nintensified westerly flow. Intriguingly, the calibrated age for L3 (5681\u00b162\u20135665\u00b156 cal. yr) \n(Table 6) falls within one of the proposed intervals of change, whereas L4 (2243\u00b178\u2013\n2237\u00b180 and 1294\u00b131 cal. yr) lies between the 3500\u20132500 and 1200\u20131000 cal. yr intervals. \nAlthough at this stage we remain cautious about such correlations, they do offer a potential set \nof large-scale boundary conditions that may account for the observed local cyclicity and \nhydrology within the mid- to late Holocene succession. \n \nConclusions \n \nDetailed analysis of a prograding sediment wedge (St Andrews Bay Member, Forth \nFormation) offshore eastern Scotland enables the following conclusions to be presented with \nregard to the Lateglacial\u2013Holocene evolution of this region: \n \n\u2022 The prograding sediment wedge was initiated as a fluvio-deltaic lowstand deposit (L1) \nduring the Younger Dryas Stadial. Relative sea level at this time is inferred to be \nbetween \u201320 and \u201330 m OD, which is at least 10 m lower than previously published \nestimates.  \n\u2022 Construction of the sediment wedge was renewed and sustained through the mid- to late \nHolocene by sub-littoral tidal processes that deposited three discrete, highstand, \nshoreface wedges (L2\u2013L4), which display both seaward progradation and longshore (to \n  \n28\nthe NE) migration. Petrographic studies indicate derivation of sediment by local \nreworking of older Quaternary deposits, including L1, and the contemporary reworking \nof the sediment wedge as it migrated, especially the topset zone. \n\u2022 Individual shoreface wedges may represent a depositional cyclicity with a predominant \nduration of about 1000 years separated by hiatuses of 1000 to 2000 years. These phases \nof sedimentation are tentatively linked to periods of strong westerly winds driving an \nenhanced influx of Atlantic water into the North Sea, which in turn drives the North Sea \ncirculation pattern. Increased rainfall during these intervals may also have contributed to \nperiodic freshening of the coastal zone off eastern Scotland via fluviatile and estuarine \ninput, resulting in the brackish marine environment recorded by the microfauna. \nHowever, correlation with the postulated global periods of Holocene rapid climate \nchange remains unclear. \n \nAcknowledgements. \u2013 We thank Tom Bradwell and Alan Stevenson for their comments on an \nearlier version of this manuscript.
