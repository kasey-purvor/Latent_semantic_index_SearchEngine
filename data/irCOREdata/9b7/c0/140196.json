It is also \nviewed as an area of opportunity to deliver bottom line profit (Berlin, 1982). However, \nthere are several aspects to shrinkage that lack common agreement, not least there are \ncompeting views on how to measure shrinkage; the amount of shrinkage in particular \nsectors; its causes; and what actions are effective in its reduction. In order to make \nprogress with these various issues a necessary first step is to clarify the nature of the \nshrinkage problem by establishing an appropriate means of measurement, which is the \nfocus of this paper. In particular, this work examines the methods for measuring shrinkage \nin Europe\u2019s Fast Moving Consumer Goods sector (FMCG), a study supported by ECR \nEurope, a de-facto trade association for grocery retailers and FMCG manufacturers \noperating in Europe2.  \nEurope\u2019s grocery retailing sector had a turnover in 2003 that exceeded \u20ac1,000 billion \n(Beck, 2004). This business sector can be characterised as complex (Pal and Byran, 2003) \nand with a diverse population of organisations. Across this varied business landscape cuts \nthe common issue of shrinkage. There are a range of different views on this issue with the \nmanagement attitude in some organisations treating it as a regrettable but inherent part of \ndoing business (Kennish, 1985) while to others it is a key opportunity to improve returns \n(Berlin, 1982). Recent research into this topic has shown shrinkage to be an important \nissue for the grocery sector to consider, not least because shrinkage cost Europe\u2019s FMCG \ngrocery industry \u20ac24 billion in 2003 (Beck, 2004). \nShrinkage has been found to be unevenly distributed and concentrates on certain products \nand certain locations (Beck, Chapman and Peacock, 2003) with these phenomena termed \nHot Products (Clark, 1999) and Hot Stores (Beck and Chapman, 2003) respectively. Hot \nproducts are those specific items that incur losses considerably higher than even \napparently similar lines, for example a particular product in a particular size of packaging \nthat is affected more than other lines in the same category. Hot stores are particular stores \nwithin the same retail chain that have losses more than double the average for that chain.  \nThe ability to identify and track these phenomena relies upon the effective measurement \nof shrinkage by stock keeping unit (SKU) and by location, and to be able to do this over \ntime.  \nPage 2 \nIn order to manage shrinkage it is clear that the right metrics must be in place. The \nobjective of this paper is therefore to present a view on the methods for measuring \nshrinkage and specifically to: \n\u2022 Review the methods for measuring shrinkage in order to list and describe \nalternative approaches and methods. \n\u2022 Establish the extent to which these methods are employed in practice in the \nEuropean FMCG sector. \n\u2022 Identify the implications this study\u2019s findings may have on methods of shrinkage \nmeasurement in the future. \nBy achieving these aims, this work contributes to the retail industry by drawing together \nunderstanding on shrinkage measurement, reporting on common practice and providing a \nguide to shrinkage measurement.  \nMethods for Measuring Shrinkage \nIn order to examine how shrinkage can be measured, a literature review was conducted \nthat deconstructed this topic into (1) the components of shrinkage and (2) methods for \nvaluing shrinkage. These two sub-topics are introduced and discussed below. Shrinkage \ncan result from several causes (Levine and Jackson, 2002). These causes tend to be \nsummarised into either (i) a set of categories or (ii) known and unknown shrinkage. These \ntwo approaches are described below. \nCategories of Shrinkage \nTypically the categorisation of shrinkage tends to comprise four categories. Beck (2003) \ndefines the four categories he uses as follows:  \nProcess Failures \nLosses due to operating procedures within the organisation including products which have \nbecome out of date, or have been reduced in price; incorrect pricing; product \nidentification errors; incorrect stock counting; products which have been damaged; \nscanning errors; and errors in deliveries to the stores (e.g. short deliveries due to errors in \npicking and dispatch from distribution centres). \nInternal Theft \n                                                                                                                                                  \n2 Information on ECR Europe is available on their website, www.ecrnet.org \nPage 3 \nThe unauthorised taking of goods or cash from a store at any time of the day or night by \nstaff employed by the company (including contract staff, for instance third party security \nstaff or maintenance workers). This includes staff theft, collusion between customers and \nstaff, employees eating stock, till shortages and the deliberate manipulation of prices. \nExternal Theft  \nThe unauthorised taking of goods or cash from a store at any time of the day or night by \ncustomers or other non-company employees. This includes incidents of shoplifting, \nfraudulent return of goods, till snatches and burglary (breaking and entering a store whilst \nit is closed). \nInter-company Fraud \nLosses due to suppliers or their agents deliberately delivering less goods than retailers are \neventually charged for by them, or retailers deliberately returning fewer goods to \nmanufacturers\/suppliers than agreed\/specified. This includes vendor and contractor fraud. \nFor retailers this refers to losses due to discrepancies in the goods supplied by third parties \nand not from their own distribution centres. \nAlthough the nomenclature varies, these four categories are similar to those used by other \nauthors, as shown by the examples contained in Table I. \nTAKE IN TABLE I \nThe differences in nomenclature appear relatively minor and there appears to be a level of \nconsistency between the four sets of categories. However caution still needs to be applied \nwhen considering the results of measurement that use these different classification \nsystems as the definitions of what lies within, or is excluded from, is not consistent across \nthem.  \nKnown and Unknown Shrinkage \nIt is also appears common for shrinkage to be categorised as being \u2018known\u2019 or \u2018unknown\u2019 \n(Beck et al, 2003) or \u2018retail crime losses\u2019 and \u2018unexplained stock losses\u2019 (Grasso, 2003). \nKnown shrinkage is the loss that has been identified, recorded and processed. Examples \nof known shrinkage include: \n\u2022 Known theft processed. \n\u2022 Known errors processed, such as out-of-date or damages. \n\u2022 Cost of sales adjustments, such as tasting, mark downs or out-of-date. \nPage 4 \n\u2022 Other, such as donations. \n \nUnknown\/unexplained shrinkage is the inventory shortage identified following a physical \nstock-take. The findings from a physical audit take precedent over the book stock record \n(Knapp and Knapp, 2000), with the difference between the two numbers being the amount \nof the inventory shortage.  \nThe nature and causes of unknown shrinkage are not identifiable, hence its name. \nHowever attempts are regularly made to apportion unknown shrinkage in to the same \ncategories used to measure known shrinkage (see for example Bamfield, 2004; Beck, \n2004; Grasso, 2003; Hollinger and Langton, 2004). These efforts tend to survey the \npractitioner community and ask respondents to estimate how much of their unknown loss \ncan be attributed to each category. Needless to say, numerous authors express their \nconcerns about this method (for example Beck, Chapman and Peacock, 2003; Bernstein, \n1963; Oliphant and Oliphant, 2001) and indicate that the findings from such research are \nunreliable. \nMethods for Valuing Shrinkage \nRetail stock can be classified in to a number of different types of stock, including: \n\u2022 Goods or other assets purchased for resale. \n\u2022 Consumable stores, e.g. carrier bags. \n\u2022 Raw materials and components, e.g. a joint of ham to be carved in the delicatessen. \n\u2022 Work in progress, e.g. partly baked bread. \n\u2022 Finished goods. \n \nThe valuation calculation of each classification will be different, therefore stock can be \nvalued in a different way depending on where it is and how it has been processed. This \ncalculation needs to be consistent with the regulatory instruments, such as the Statement \nof Standard Accounting Practice and International Accounting Standards. Examples of \nstock valuation are shown in Table II.  \nTAKE IN TABLE II \nAccounting practices point towards using different methods of valuation of goods \ndepending on their status. The merits of this for financial reporting are undisputable \nPage 5 \nhowever it appears that in practice few retailers are able to do this when measuring \nshrinkage. This would require constantly updated information on each batch of goods \nconcerning their purchase price; their status in the supply chain, i.e. to determine what \ncosts had been incurred during work in progress and whether they had become finished \ngoods; and a view on the saleability of the goods to determine their net realisable value. \nInstead retailers appear to opt for a more simple method of valuation, such as: \n\u2022 Sales value. \n\u2022 Purchase price. \n\u2022 Transfer cost. \n \nEach of these methods of valuation possesses strengths and weaknesses, which are \nsummarised in Table III.  \nTAKE IN TABLE III \nEach of the valuation methods has its merits and retailers should consider the possibility \nof using more than one method of valuation. However this raises the concern that data \nbased on different valuations could mix and create more problems than the benefit \naccrued. This problem would be overcome if the cost components associated with goods \nwere available. Valuation and also conversion between different methods of valuation \ncould then be achieved by including or excluding particular cost components. \nIn order to gauge current practice, the methods of stock valuation reported in the accounts \nof selected retailers that support ECR Europe were examined. The findings from these \nreports are summarised in Table IV. \nTAKE IN TABLE IV \nTable IV shows the various companies inventory valuation policy categorised against the \nmenu of methods listed in the column headings. Definitions for the inventory valuation \nmethods used in Table IV are provided in Appendix 1.  \nThe main finding from this investigation in to inventory valuation policy is that there is no \ndominant method for valuing stock and there are examples where companies employ \nmore than one method of inventory valuation e.g. Wal*Mart.  \nPage 6 \nSurvey of Methods for Measuring Shrinkage \nThe literature review identified a range of alternative approaches and methods to \nmeasuring shrinkage. In order to establish a view of the current practices employed by \nEuropean retailers a survey was undertaken.   \n \nThe survey examined a range of issues relating to shrinkage in the FMCG sector, where \none of these issues was the methods used to measure shrinkage. Other issues included the \nlevels of shrinkage and the organisational functions involved in addressing shrinkage the \nfindings of which are to be reported separately, elsewhere. This meant that the survey was \nfairly long and required an extensive amount of effort to complete. One of the affects of \nthis was to reduce the response level, a point discussed below.   \nThe survey was carried out in 2004 across 25 European countries. Carrying out research \nthat attempts to collect comparable data from different countries is notoriously difficult \u2013 \nbesides the obvious problems of language, difficulties can emerge with meaning and \nterminology. The survey instrument for FMCG retailers was translated into 7 languages \n(Czech, French, German, Italian, Polish, Portuguese and Spanish) and was distributed to \nsenior members of security departments, audit departments, or senior members of staff \nwith responsibility for loss prevention in major retail companies. Overall, 239 \nquestionnaires were sent out to companies in 25 countries. The sample was selected based \nupon targeting companies that they were primarily grocery related businesses and had the \nlargest share of the market within their own country (using data sourced from Planet \nRetail, a company that markets such data). The aim of this approach was to maximise \nrepresentation within the survey of each national market across Europe. The focus on \ngrocery businesses, as opposed to other types of retailer, reflects the area of interest of the \nresearch team and gives continuity to the data returned by these organisations, with each \nfacing similar issues.  The implications for generalisability and representativeness are \ndiscussed later in this paper.  \n \nOn average, for those countries selected to be included in the analysis, the market share of \nthe respondents varied between 10 and 40 per cent. In total, the study received 31 \nresponses from retailers, a 13% response rate.  These businesses had a total turnover of \nPage 7 \n\u20ac137.2 billion or 13.7% of the total European market share. This response rate is \nrelatively low and therefore restricts the ability to generalise the findings from this work.  \nHowever the research team viewed 31 responses as providing sufficient information to \nenable meaningful analysis to take place around a limited set of topics. The analysis \nmethod was not unduly affected by the limitations of the sample size as only basic \nquantitative techniques were employed. This primarily involved entering the data from the \nreturned questionnaires into a MS Excel spreadsheet. This allowed basic counts of the \ndata to be made, for example to determine the frequency (stated as a percentage) that a \nparticular criterion was met.  More advanced statistical tests on the data were not \nnecessary as they generally fell beyond the aims of this research. \n \nResults \n \nThe results of the survey are presented here under following five headings: \n \n\u2022 Finding 1. The extent to which known loss and unknown loss are included in the \ncalculation of shrinkage. \n\u2022 Finding 2. The supply chain issues included in the measure of shrinkage.  \n\u2022 Finding 3. The extent to which different costing methods are used to value shrinkage. \n\u2022 Finding 4. The resolution to which shrinkage data is captured. \n\u2022 Finding 5. The frequency with which shrinkage data is gathered. \n \nFinding 1.  The extent to which known loss and unknown loss are included in the \ncalculation of shrinkage \nAll companies that responded to the survey included unknown loss in their calculation of \nshrinkage. Ninety percent of respondents also included known loss in their calculation of \nshrinkage. These findings indicate that most companies consider shrinkage to consist of \nboth known and unknown losses. However not all companies include known loss in their \ncalculation. Those companies that do not include known loss in their calculation of \nshrinkage appear to define shrinkage as being those losses that can not be attributed to a \nknown cause. \nPage 8 \nStore Related Issues Included in the Measure of Shrinkage \nKnown loss can be categorised under a number of headings. Examples of the more \ncommon causes of known loss recorded at stores include: \n\u2022 Out of date, where the shelf life of a good has been reached and it cannot be sold. \n\u2022 Damage, where a good has been damaged and cannot be sold. \n\u2022 Price marked downs, where the price of a good has been reduced, e.g. because the \ngood is nearing the end of its sales life or has been damaged. \n\u2022 Donations, where a good has been donated freely and not sold. \n \nThe survey sought to establish which of these categories were normally included by the \nretailer when calculating their rate of stock loss. The findings from the survey are \npresented in Table V. \nTAKE IN TABLE V \nThe findings from the survey show that most retailers include out of date, damage and \nprice mark downs in their calculation of shrinkage. A small number of companies include \ndonations. It may be that not all companies have a policy that allows goods to be donated. \nEqually it may be the case that those companies that do allow donations do not view them \nas a form of shrinkage. Several companies indicated that they employ \u2018other\u2019 categories \nunder which they classify their loss although this was marked without listing what these \ncategories were.  \n \nFinding 2. The Supply Chain Issues Included in the Measure of Shrinkage \nShrinkage can occur in a retailer\u2019s supply chain as well as in stores. In order to understand \nwhether this was measured, retailers were asked whether they recorded shrinkage in their \nsupply chain. The findings from the survey are shown above in Table VI. \nTAKE IN TABLE VI \nThese results show that more than a half of retailers include losses in their regional \ndistribution centres in their calculation of shrinkage. Slightly more than a third includes \nlosses in transport, i.e. between distribution centres or between a distribution centre and \nPage 9 \nthe stores. Fewer still included losses by third party logistics service providers in their \ncalculation of shrinkage.  \nNot all retailers in the survey operate a distribution network, using instead direct \ndistribution to store by suppliers. However these companies are the exception and do not \nmake a notable impact to the results shown above. Instead, the results point to retailers \nfailing to measure the losses that undoubtedly occur in their supply chain.  \n \nFinding 3. The Extent to Which Different Costing Methods are used to Value \nShrinkage \nThe discussion presented earlier described the various ways in which shrinkage can be \nvalued. The survey sought to identify which of these methods are used in practice. The \nresults of the survey are shown in Table VII. \nTAKE IN TABLE VII \nThe findings from the survey show that whilst the most common method of shrinkage \nvaluation was the \u2018retail sales value\u2019 method (52%), there is not a dominant method of \nshrinkage valuation amongst European grocery retailers. Instead there is widespread use \nof both retail sales value and cost price as the preferred method of valuation. The one \nmethod that receives little support is the transfer cost method.  \n \nFinding 4. The Resolution to Which Shrinkage Data is Captured \nThe resolution to which shrinkage data is captured was examined by considering the \ncapture of data for both locations and products. Data on shrinkage can be captured \naccording to the location where it was discovered. Retailers could therefore record \nlocation shrinkage for each of their stores. Alternatively they may capture this data for the \ncompany as a whole.  \nData on product loss can be captured at various levels of detail. The highest detail is at the \nlevel of individual stock keeping units, SKU (also known as \u2018references\u2019 in many \nEuropean countries). Where SKU data is not recorded, losses may be recorded for a \ncategory. Categories typically consist of between two hundred and a thousand related \nproducts. The lowest level of detail is to collate all loss data together into a single, \nPage 10 \ncompany wide shrinkage figure. The findings from the survey of shrinkage data resolution \nare presented in Table VIII. \nTAKE IN TABLE VIII \nCompanies could report multiple levels of data capture, hence the results do not add up to \none hundred percent. With regard to location, companies tended to record their shrinkage \nby individual store although not all companies did this. Most companies compiled \nshrinkage for the company as a whole although this was less than the number that \nreported collating it by store. This shows that not all companies who collect shrinkage \ndata by store compile this data at the company level.  \nThe resolution of data on shrinkage by product shows that most companies have data by \nSKU, although not all. Two companies that did not collect data by SKU collected their \ndata by category. The remainder collected data at a global level.  \n \nFinding 5. The Frequency with Which Shrinkage Data is Gathered \nThe frequency with which retailers undertake stock audits was the final topic surveyed. \nStock audits are a popular mechanism for collecting data and companies have several \noptions on how often to undertake them. Stock audits tend to be undertaken to determine \nthe assets of the company for financial reporting reasons on an annual or bi-annual basis. \nThe amount of goods found to be held by the company can be compared against the \ncompany\u2019s records, with discrepancies noted. Inventory counting can take place at times \nother than the stock audit for financial reporting reasons. These instances tend to occur to \nprovide information for stock control. Measurement for stock control seems to occur \nmonthly or less. Given the erratic number of days in months this converts into periods of \nfour or five weeks. The survey sought to establish the frequency with which shrinkage \ndata is gathered in terms of these three time periods of annually, bi-annually and less than \nfive weeks. \nA second time related issue explored in the survey was to establish whether retailers audit \nshrinkage when a store manager leaves. The rationale being that a manager may influence \nthe results of a stock audit, leaving behind a shrinkage issue that could not be attributed to \nthem when it comes to light at a subsequent stock audit. The findings from the survey on \nthe frequency with which shrinkage data is gathered are presented in Table IX. \nPage 11 \nTAKE IN TABLE IX \nThe survey found that most organisations collect their shrinkage data bi-annually with \nmost of the remaining collecting it annually. Less than fourteen percent of respondents \ngather data every five weeks or less. No companies reported collecting data when a \nmanager leaves a store. \nDiscussion of Results \nThe findings from the survey provide useful insight into the methods for measuring \nshrinkage used by European grocery retailers. Caution needs to be applied when \nreviewing these results owing to the relatively small number of respondents to the survey \n(31 companies), especially when seeking to extend the understanding provided by the \nfindings.  With this proviso in mind it still remains possible to paint an overall picture \nfrom these findings that reveals pockets of good practice in shrinkage measurement \nhowever this appears to be limited to a few companies that possess a system of \nmeasurement capable of effectively informing decision making.  \nAt a more specific level of finding, the numbers of retailers that use retail sales value or \ncost price to value shrinkage are roughly comparable. Both approaches have their merits \nand issues so the choice of method should depend on company objectives. Caution needs \nto apply when comparing between levels of shrinkage that have been valued differently, \ntherefore it is important to clarify the valuation method used by a particular company \nwhen reviewing its performance. \nIn light of accounting discrepancies in industry in general, e.g. at Enron, and in grocery \nretailing in particular, e.g. at Ahold, stewardship cannot be sidelined, highlighting a role \nfor valuing shrinkage at cost price. However effective management of shrinkage presents \nthe opportunity to dramatically improve financial performance and this opportunity needs \nto be aggressively pursued, which is where valuing shrinkage at retail value is \nadvantageous. This points to the need for both methods for valuing shrinkage to be \nemployed. The challenge for management is to use these methods in harmony, \nrecognising when they should and should not be used and to maintain consistency that \nallows data to be converted between formats without degradation.  \nEncouragingly, data is generally gathered on both known and unknown shrinkage. This \ndemonstrates that retailers are aware of both issues when measuring shrinkage in their \nPage 12 \nstores, although some gaps remain in the consistency with which the range of known \nlosses are reported. Less promising is the low level of data collection in the supply chain. \nThere is a strong indication that when losses in the supply chain are not identified they \nbecome attributed to stores. Consequentially the poor level of data collection in the supply \nchain will over-emphasise the amount of loss in stores and underplay the scale in the \nsupply chain. \nThe uneven balance in measurement between stores and the supply chain indicates that \nstores are the main focus for shrinkage management, with the critical role of effective \nsupply chain operations overlooked. This suggests that retailers do not view shrinkage \nholistically and continue to treat it in a simplistic, isolated manner. Evidence to support \nthis supposition is that despite the focus on shrinkage in stores, retailers are generally \nlimited in their ability to collate detailed data by store and by SKU level or to be able to \naggregate this data up for the company as a whole.  \nA systemic approach requires the ability to gather data at the lowest level and collate it at \na macro level for analysis. The results from the survey suggest that retailers are strongest \nat collecting data at the micro level but the problem is that they are not converting it into \nmacro level data.  \nWhere micro level data is collated to the macro level, this would allow the investigation \nof phenomena such as Hot Stores and Hot Products. The ability to navigate between top \nlevel data and the underlying detail provides the capability to identify where \nconcentrations of shrinkage lie and then to drill in to those key areas of loss in detail using \ndata mining techniques. This capability was not found to be widespread amongst the \nsurvey respondents. \nA key finding from prior research is the importance of being able to focus attention on \nHot Products and Hot Stores. Without the ability to gather data on shrinkage by SKU and \nby store, retailers cannot focus efforts on to their key areas of loss. Equally, detailed data \nneeds to be accessible so it can be aggregated from SKU and store and analysed at the \ncompany level.  \nData should be collected on a regular basis to allow decisions to be made on emerging \ntrends and to track the effect of shrinkage management efforts. Good practice is to \nincrease the frequency that data is gathered. The majority of companies reported that they \ncollect data at six-month intervals. Several companies demonstrate that it is possible to \nPage 13 \ncollect data monthly. These frequent updates on performance are likely to reinforce \nefforts to drive improvements and to keep abreast of changes in the pattern of shrinkage \nsuch as its scale, location and types of product affected. \nConclusions \nShrinkage affects shoppers in a number of ways including reduced on-shelf availability, \nreduced assortment, defensive merchandising and higher prices. None of these provide \nshopper satisfaction, hence sales are depressed and profits foregone. In addition to lost \nsales, shrinkage also affects the profits of retailers through associated additional cost. \nThe findings from this research respond to this situation by reviewing the measures \nneeded to inform management decision making and identifying good practice in place in \nthe sector. In summary, this consists of collecting data: \n\u2022 By product and location. \n\u2022 Frequently, robustly and consistently. \n\u2022 Across the supply chain, in stores (sales floor and back of store), transportation and \ndistribution centres. \n \nThis data will clearly identify where shrinkage is occurring and inform management \ndecision making on where to direct corrective action to control loss. \nThe scale of the impact of shrinkage on shopper satisfaction and retailer profitability is \nsufficient to warrant senior management attention and investment in gathering the data \nnecessary to guide management decisions. An effective response requires the \ndevelopment of a measurement system that consists of two parts: \n\u2022 A database containing a breakdown of the cost components of each SKU. \n\u2022 Data on shrinkage by SKU, by location (e.g. store or distribution centre), and by time.  \n \nThe first part of the measurement system provides reference data on each product, which \nwould be set up when a product is introduced by the retailer. This provides the cost \nbreakdown of a single unit. The second part of the measurement system provides a record \non how many items are lost, from where and when. When brought together, these two \ndata sources provide a valuable input to management that informs them on the overall \nPage 14 \nscale of shrinkage and both cost and lost profit implications. This data will enable them to \ndetermine where and when losses occur, allowing resources to be deployed to diagnose, \naddress and resolve key issues. \nIt is acknowledged that data should be reported to different people in different ways. For \nexample it seems likely that store managers need different information than buyers and \nthe same will be true for other key stakeholders such as regional security managers, Board \nmembers, the media and shareholders. It is therefore the case that having the capability to \nmeasure shrinkage is only one component of the overall challenge of reducing shrinkage. \nThere remains the challenge of being able to make good use of these measures through \ndata analysis (e.g. data mining) and through dissemination of key summaries to the \nvarious stakeholders required to direct and undertake concerted action. \nPage 15 \nReferences \nBamfield, J.
