Best practice project risk management processes are claimed to be\nself-evidently correct. However, project risk management involves a choice between\nwhich information is utilized and which is deemed to be irrelevant and hence excluded.\nLittle research has been carried out to ascertain the manifestation of barriers to optimal\nproject risk management such as \u2018irrelevance\u2019; the deliberate inattention of risk actors to\nrisk. This paper presents the results of a qualitative study of IT project managers,\ninvestigating their reasons for deeming certain known risks to be irrelevant. The results\nboth confirm and expand on Smithson\u2019s [1] taxonomy of ignorance and uncertainty and\nin particular offer further context related insights into the phenomenon of \u2018irrelevance\u2019\nin project risk management. We suggest that coping with \u2018irrelevance\u2019 requires defence\nmechanisms, the effective management of relevance as well as the setting of, and\nsticking to priorities.\nKeywords: Project, Risk, Process, Irrelevance, Effectiveness\n3INTRODUCTION\nInstitutions such as the Project Management Institute (PMI) and the Association of\nProject Management (APM) promote \u2018best\u2019 practice project management standards.\nProject risk management, as one of the key disciplines of project management, is\ndefined as the systematic process of identifying, analysing and responding to risk as\nproject-related events, or managerial behaviour, that is not definitely known in advance,\nbut that has potential for adverse consequences on a project objective [2]. Project risk\nmanagement claims to enable project managers to effectively manage risk related\ninformation.\nRaz and Michael [3] have investigated the extent to which project managers perceived\nproject risk management as effective. Specifically, they looked at an extensive range of\nrisk management techniques, rating each against a \u2018project management performance\u2019\nindex based on the responses to their survey. However, such evidence is scarce, often\ndescriptive and inchoate. In order to address some of these shortcomings, this study\ninvestigates how \u2018irrelevance\u2019; the deliberate ignorance of risk related information,\nmanifests itself in the context of project risk management and how it constrains the\nperceived effectiveness of project risk management. In doing so, we seek to add to the\ndebate on the effectiveness of risk management processes by considering the influence\nof social and cognitive factors as intervening conditions in project risk management.\nBEST PRACTICE IN PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT\nRisks potentially endanger the ability of the project manager to meet predefined project\nobjectives of scope, time and cost. This ultimately means that tasks may take longer\nthan planned with a negative consequence on the project manager\u2019s fulfilment of the\nproject objectives [2]. Because of this potential to adversely influence a project\u2019s\nperformance, the PMI acknowledges the management of risk as one of its nine key\n4knowledge areas in its Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge [2].\nAccording to Pender [4], this represents \u2018best\u2019 practice in the area of project\nmanagement.\nBeyond the PMI standards, there are a number of other \u201cbest practice\u201d project risk\nmanagement processes such as the British Standards Institute [5], the Office of\nGovernment Commerce [6] or the UK Association for Project Management [7]. The\nbasic structure of all these models is similar. Table 1 gives an overview of the key\nelements.\nTable 1: Overview of main project risk management processes\nMajor steps in project risk\nmanagement\nPMBOK - PMI risk management process\n[2]\nOGC \u2013 Management of risk\n[9]\nPRAM - APM risk management process\n[12]\nPlanning Risk Management Planning Context Focus\nDefine\nIdentification Risk Identification Risk Identification Identify\nStructure\nAnalysis Risk Analysis Assess - Estimate Estimate\nAssess - Evaluate Evaluate\nResponse Risk Response Planning Plan\nImplement\nCommunicate\nPlan\nRisk (Monitoring and) Control Ownership\nManage\nRegardless of the number and definition of stages, the mentioned project risk\nmanagement processes have one element in common: \u201can activity that deals with\nplanning actions that will be implemented in order to reduce the exposure to risk\u201d [8].\nThis principle activity can be subdivided into four major stages: planning, identification,\nanalysis, and response. Firstly, a project manager can apply risk management planning\nto define what activities should be taken to approach project risks. Secondly, risk\nidentification allows project managers to single out risks that may affect the project\nobjectives. Thirdly, by using risk analysis a project manager evaluates quantitatively or\nqualitatively the likely consequences of risks as well as the likelihood of occurrence [9].\n5Fourthly, risk response helps a project manager to develop procedures and techniques to\nmitigate the defined risks, and enables the project manager to keep track of these, to\nidentify new risks during the project and to implement risk response plans [2].\nBest practice project management standards, as set out by the PMI and APM, indirectly\nclaim to be self-evidently effective. In this respect, Williams [10] argues:\n\u201cProject management as set out in this work is presented as a set of procedures\nthat are self-evidently correct: following these procedures will produce\neffectively managed projects; project failure is indicative of inadequate attention\nto the project management procedures.\u201d\nProject risk management processes such as those described have their foundation in\nexpected utility theorem (EUT) [7, 11]. Expected utility is \u201ca weighted average of the\nutilities of all the possible outcomes that could flow from a particular decision, where\nhigher-probability outcomes count more than lower-probability outcomes in calculating\nthe average\u201d [12]. In other words, the utility of decision making choices are weighted\nby their probabilities and outcomes [11, 13].\nEUT has generally been accepted in the literature as a model of rational choice for\ntaking risky decisions [11, 12] and is considered a fruitful framework for decision-\nmaking in situations where risk is a factor [14]. A key feature of EUT is the\npresumption of rationality, or what Weber et al call \u2018hyper rationality\u2019 [15]. This\nprevailing normative and explanatory framework in decision making under uncertainty\ntends to ignore the absence or \u2018distortion\u2019 of truth. Hence, social influences are\ndownplayed. For example, ignorance is excluded.\n6THE ROLE OF IGNORANCE IN PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT\nRecently, some attention has been paid to ignorance in various contexts [16, 17].\nResearch has increasingly concentrated on the pursuit of certainty and how to overcome\nignorance, which is often cited as a lack of \u2018true\u2019 knowledge [18]. Although this\ndefinition deserves credit, developing a single definition would be inappropriate\nbecause ignorance is a multidimensional concept with various facets (see\nFigure 1). In particular, a useful distinction can be made between deliberate ignorance,\ndriven by social factors and\/or conditioning, and ignorance as an affective impulse,\nmeaning it is beyond one\u2019s control, both systemically and cognitively [19]. The concept\nof error including its various sub-concepts (see\nTable 2,\nFigure 1), such as distortion, relates to the passive connotation of incomplete knowledge\n(being ignorant). Perfect knowledge about the future state of an environment is not\npossible and error will always occur despite attempts of correction through clarification\nand exactitude. In contrast, deliberate ignoring is defined as irrelevance that may be\nmanaged through the application of specific defence mechanisms [1]. It is not that\n7information is missing or wrong (error), but rather that the presence of particular\ninformation is not deemed important by stakeholders risk in a particular context. While\nindividuals have limited control over the extent of error, they have substantial control\nover the extent to which they choose to regard risk information as being irrelevant.\nTherefore, it is with irrelevance that we concern ourselves in this study (i.e. deliberate\nignorance) rather than error.\nFigure 1: Taxonomy of ignorance [1]\nIgnorance\nError Irrelevance\nTabooUntopicality UndecidabilityIncomplete-nessDistortion\nConfusion Inaccuracy Uncertainty Absence\nProbabilityVagueness Ambiguity\nFuzziness Nonspecifitciy\nTable 2: Types of ignorance - meanings [1]\nTerm Meaning\n1.

Issues that people must\nnot know, deal with, inquire about, or investigate\n2.3. Undecidability Issues that can not be designated true or false because\nthey are considered insoluble, or solutions that are not\nverifiable\nThe first, and most obvious kind of irrelevance is untopicability, referring to\ninformation that is declared \u2018off-topic\u2019 resulting in a limiting the range of information\nand risks that project managers deem pertinent to focus upon. Some literature on project\nrisk management refers to untopicability. For example, Margolis [20] argues: \u201cexperts\nin general learn to concentrate on what is critical in their experience with the domain at\nhand and ignore anything else.\u201d\nA further sub-concept is taboo. Taboos reflect a moral and\/or cautionary restriction\nplaced on action based on what is deemed inappropriate [1, 21]. The process of project\nrisk management requires project manager to expose risks for the purpose of analysing\nand responding to them. However, the exposure may also create anxiety among\nstakeholders, and negative thoughts may be suppressed [22]. In an extreme case, the\nexposure of risks may result in the cancellation of the project because stakeholders take\nnew risks into account and decide not to go ahead with a project that is now perceived\nas too risky [23]. As a result, project managers may limit the degree to which they\n9identify new risks. Risks, although legitimate, may then be suppressed during the risk\nidentification phase and ultimately ignored.\nThe final aspect of irrelevance is undecidability. This concerns whether information is\nconsidered \u2018true\u2019 or \u2018false\u2019 [1]. Due to the lack of statistical data for predicting future\nrisks, project managers often rely on subjective estimates [24]. However, other\nstakeholders may not believe in the credibility of these estimates. Hence, during the\nphase of risk identification and risk analysis, stakeholders might disagree [25] over\nwhich risks are considered to be \u2018true\u2019, with the result that some risks will be deemed as\nnot pertinent and, as a result, are excluded from any active management.\nFew studies have investigated these types of ignorance, especially in the context of\nproject management. Although some studies have tried to address the importance of\nmalice of project managers managing risk, most of the evidence is descriptive and relies\non assumptions rather than on empirical findings [26, 27]. These findings thus lack\ntheoretical relevance. This study aims to address the limitation by providing empirical\nevidence on the role of irrelevance in project risk management. As a result, in the light\nof the lack of previous research, this study will shed some light on whether irrelevance\ncan be seen to manifest itself in IT project management and, if this is the case, the\nnature of the impact irrelevance has on risk management in IT projects?\nMETHOD\nThis study used an exploratory approach in order to understand the \u2018social reality\u2019 of\nproject managers and how they experienced irrelevance in project risk management.\nFirst, the research sought to confirm that the three types of irrelevance (undecidability,\ntaboo, untopicality) were experienced, and could be readily identified, in the everyday\nworking life by the research participants. When the different types of irrelevance had\nbeen established, in the context of project risk management, questions were asked to\n10\nprobe their perceived impact on the effectiveness of project risk management processes\nthat were being employed in projects where the respondents were working. A further\naim of the investigation was to explore whether further types of deliberate ignorance\ncould be identified.\nDue to the exploratory nature of the study, an interpretivist research approach was\nadopted, employing face-to-face semi-structured interviews, guided by a topic rather\nthan a set of specific questions. The purpose of this was to allow an in-depth insight into\nthe lived reality of the research participants in their project environments. The\npopulation from which the sample was drawn consisted of IT project managers who\nwere members of the PMI and the APM. For this study, non-probability sampling was\napplied, because it is often more beneficial \u201cto learn a lot from an atypical case than a\nlittle from a magnificently typical case\u201d [28]. Atypical in this study implies that cases\nwere chosen that revealed overall extreme difficulties which IT project managers faced\nwhile managing project risks. The rationale for such a deliberative sampling method is\nthat extreme and atypical cases tend to give more information [28] and thus allowed the\nphenomenon of intervening factors to become more \u2018visible\u2019. The sample size in the\nexploratory phase of this study was determined by conceptual saturation. Saturation was\nreached after 18 in-depth interviews when no new information or themes about\nirrelevance were observed in the data. The profile of the sample in the exploratory\nresearch is shown in Table 3:\nTable 3: Profile of exploratory sample\nCompany Interviewee Project Position Approx. project\nbudget (\u00a3m)\nProject duration\n(months)\nCompany A Interviewee 1 Project 1 IT project manager 15 36\nCompany B Interviewee 2 Project 2 IT consultant 5 18\nCompany C Interviewee 3 Project 3 IT project manager 1 1\nCompany C Interviewee 4 Project 4 IT project manager 10 2\nCompany D Interviewee 5 Project 5 IT project manager 0.008 0.25\n11\nCompany E Interviewee 6 Project 6 IT project manager 18 12\nCompany F Interviewee 7 Project 7 IT project manager 1 12\nCompany G Interviewee 8 Project 8 IT project manager 30-40 18\nCompany H Interviewee 9 Project 9 IT project manager 3 14\nCompany I Interviewee 10 Project 10 IT project manager 7 18\nCompany J Interviewee 11 Project 11 IT project manager 10 18\nCompany J Interviewee 12 Project 12 IT project manager 150 48\nCompany J Interviewee 13 Project 13 IT project manager 1-2 1\nCompany J Interviewee 14 Project 14 IT project manager 40 6\nCompany J Interviewee 15 Project 15 IT project manager 100 6\nCompany J Interviewee 16 Project 16 IT project manager 1000 120\nCompany J Interviewee 17 Project 17 IT project manager 30 18\nCompany K Interviewee 18 Project 18 IT project manager 8 36\nAs can be seen in Table 3, some of the IT project managers work for the same company.\nHowever, each interview related to a different project. In this study, the specific project\nbeing discussed by the interviewees, and the interviewees themselves were independent\nvariables. Project risk management was the dependent variable. In this study, all the\ninterviewees were project managers, or senior members of the project team, who had\nresponsibility for implementing the project risk management process. Clearly, these\nindividuals had a particular, situated perspective which would differ from other project\nactors and stakeholders (such as project owners\/sponsors). For these other project\nactors, the findings might well be different.\nFor the purpose of making sense of the qualitative data contained in the interview\ntranscripts, a template approach [29] was applied using a proprietary qualitative data\nanalysis software package. Some codes existed prior to the data analysis based on\nSmithson\u2019s taxonomy [1]. These served as main codes, within which sub codes\nemerged. The characteristics of the main codes changed continuously up to the stage\nwhere no data further illuminated coding (concept saturation).\n12\nFINDINGS\nProject managers were questioned about how they managed risk, whether it was\neffective from their point of view and what difficulties they encountered. Those\nhighlighted difficulties that related to a deliberate inattention to risk were further\nexplored.\nUntopicality\nThis was first type of irrelevance that emerged during the analysis. For example,\nInterviewee 16 noted that project managers working in his project mainly focused on\ntechnical risk, delaminating the range of risks to be considered:\n\u201cThey looked purely on the implementation and not from a technical point of\nview, they had not looked at it from a business point of view.\u201d (Interviewee 16)\nThe decision to restrict the degree of information appears to focus on the perceived ease\nof information processing. Risks are deemed pertinent that are actually \u2018easy\u2019 to\nidentify, analyse and respond to:\n\u201cWe looked for risks that were easily identifiable, but didn't actually have\nserious consequences for the project. The project was not really at threat from\nthese risks.\u201d (Interviewee 1)\nSome project managers identified that those risks that were easy to process were those\nthat may not have an actual impact on the project outcome and that softer behaviour\nrelated risks should not be neglected:\n\u201cThe other issue was putting these risks into words, because they're often soft\nrisks - the human factor. It is obviously easier to describe something technical. If\nI say, 'OK, the lorry doesn't arrive. What do I do then? I'll send another lorry', I\n13\ncan put that into words and come up with this or that measure. It's a simple\nprocess.\u201d (Interviewee 1)\nThese examples show that project mangers focus on specific topics (e.g. on technical\nrisk) but declare other topics are irrelevant. Nevertheless, what causes untopicality in\nproject management and why do project managers declare risks outside their scope of\nproject risk management? This study seems to indicate that first, that project managers\naccept that information that is easiest to process (perceived ease of risk management)\nand not necessarily that which may be most critical (perceived usefulness of risk\nmanagement). A tame problem [30] receives more attention than wicked problem\nbecause it\n\uf0b7 has a relatively well-defined and stable problem statement.\n\uf0b7 has a definite stopping point, i.e. we know when the solution or a solution is\nreached.\n\uf0b7 has a solution which can be objectively evaluated as being right or wrong.\n\uf0b7 belongs to a class of similar problems which can be solved in a similar manner.\n\uf0b7 has solutions which can be tried and abandoned.\nProject managers are increasingly faced with problems of organised complexity,\nclusters of interrelated or interdependent problems, or systems of problems. Problems\nsuch as these, that cannot be solved in relative isolation from one another are messes.\nProject managers sort out messes through systems methods and modelling, focusing on\nprocesses and interdisciplinary approaches. Rather than simply breaking things down\ninto parts and fixing components, project managers examine the patterns of interactions\namong parts, focusing on redundancy or irrelevance. Short [31] suggests: \u201cAll too often\nsuch measures rest upon what can easily be counted, rather than on what is meaningful\n14\nto those who are at risk, \u2026\u201d. Those risks that attract more attention than others may be\n\u201cunusually visible, sensational, and easy to imagine\u201d [32]. Rothstein [33] mentions in\nanother context, that risk actors tended to focus on the better known and readily-\nresolvable risks, obvious risks or these being perceived as legitimate. Hence, the\nproblem of wicked messes persists because managers continue to believe that there are\nsuch things as unilateral causation and independent and dependent variables.\nUndecidability\nUnlike topicality, the salient characteristic of undecidability is the lack of agreement on\nrisks, expressed by one interviewee :\n\u201cWe couldn't come to any opinion.\u201d (Interviewee 5)\nIn some projects, project managers failed to agree on possible threats to the project\noutcome, the likelihood that they would materialise and the appropriate response to\nmitigate the risk. Reason for the lack of agreement was the degree of criticality\nattributed to the risk. Risks that were not affected by third parties in a project were\nconsidered less critical than those directly affecting oneself:\n\u201cIn terms there are certain risks which they do not regard as high risk which we\nwould regard as being high risk. At the end of the day, it was our company's\nname on the telephone that was put on the customer's desk so any issue about the\nquality would directly affect us. It was not the partner's name so there was a\ncertain issue like closeness to the product which made us much more sensitive to\nany potential issue that may come up and may be perceived to be a quality issue\nwith the technology. We thought that partner was less sensitive to that kind of\nissue.\u201d (Interviewee 10)\n15\nThe degree of undecidability or the inability to designate a risk as \u2018true\u2019 or \u2018false\u2019 was\nalso influenced by the notion of \u2018hidden agendas\u2019 or undisclosed conflicting objectives\nbetween the project stakeholders.\n\u201cThere was a large element of mistrust in this project. We had multiple\nconsultancies operating in the one consortium. Some of the consultancies were\nnatural competitors outside of this consortium and therefore within the\nconsortium there was a lot of mistrust. As a result, the client had a degree of\nmistrust with regard to the various hidden agendas that might have been\noperating within that consortium.\u201d (Interviewee 13)\nThe lack of decidability on whether the message of risk is considered to be reliable,\nlegitimate, fair or the deliverer of the message to be open and forthcoming, consistent\nhonest, caring, concerned and competent [34], as well as the lack of ex-post decision\ncontrol at the ex-ante stage of predicting risks and planning responses to risk is likely to\nlead to a \u2018relative credibility\u2019 of risks. This means that risk actors may perceive the\nrisk\u2019s \u2018true\u2019 value differently. Among the interviewees who mentioned this, on their\nprojects no consensus was achieved among stakeholders about the credibility of risks.\nThe lack of consensus between risk actors\u2019 perceptions of risk relates to disbelief or a\nlack of faith in the message (risk) or the source of the message (person who produces\nthe risk) [20, 35, 36]; it is a question of trust [37].\nTrust appears to be the root cause of risk conflicts [38] and disagreements about risk\u2019s\ntrue nature. The problem of mistrust is addressed by Ritchie and Marshall [39] who\nargue: \u201cThere is a natural tendency to define a problem in such a way that the analytical\nresults are valid and credible. \u2026, hazards which can be evaluated with confidence have\nbeen given comparatively more attention than other hazards\u201d. Hence, the disbelief in\nrisk by risk actors or the disbelief in the source of risk is likely to relate to the risk\n16\nactors\u2019 agreement on the management of risks that are clearer [40], more obvious and\ncontrollable [41] or easier to measure [42]. The sometimes conflicting relative\ncredibility of risk estimates perceived by stakeholders tended to lead to lack of\ncooperation.\nTaboo\nSome interviewees described risk as a taboo. Because it would entail the disclosure of\ninconvenient information to project stakeholders, some risks were ignored. Taboos were\nalready considered beyond the pale at the bidding stage of the project:\n\u201c\u2026 anyway, we had to go through a tendering process at the start of the project\nand, during this process, we presented ourselves in such a way that we would\nseem as reasonable and competent as possible. And problems and risks don't go\ndown so well. We wanted to come across as people who could get the project\nunder way and complete it. The first aim was to win the tender, no matter what\nthe cost. In this sense, we had a somewhat unrealistic schedule.\u201d (Interviewee 5)\n\u201cI think only to a limited extent, as we would probably have identified risks, but\nthey could never have been brought to the client's attention, because the priority\nwas simply the successful completion of the project.\u201d (Interviewee 6)\n\u201cNot just unnerve them, but also lose the project, because there was very strong\ncompetition from other providers.\u201d (Interviewee 6)\nAs a result, in order to be viewed by stakeholders as competent as possible to deliver the\ndesired project outcome, project mangers sought to avoid being perceived as entities\nwho predicted calamity at every opportunity:\n\u201cI didn't want to be the doomsayer in the euphoric preliminary phase.\u201d\n(Interviewee 5)\n17\nOne way to reduce anxiety among stakeholders, that may arise through confronting\nthem with uncertainties with possible negative consequences, is to deliberately ignore\nrisks [43]. This choice of denial to or by stakeholders lies in the \u201cfreedom to choose\nwhether or not to expose oneself (and others) to the dangers which lie in the activity (of\nrisk management)\u201d [44]. This would lead to the benefit of stakeholders (and by this we\nparticularly mean project owners or sponsors) not being confronted with uncertainty. As\na result of this apparent benefit (having to deal with the \u201cfear of the unknown\u201d [45])\nindividuals tend to be unwilling to manage risks [46]. Their unwillingness relates to the\ntemptation to give people the answers they want to hear, and the answers are apparent\ncertainty or a perception of a safe and predictable world [32, 43]. Because stakeholders\nmay perceive risk (management) to be a gloomy and negative affair [15] or because\nstakeholders are more concerned with the exposure to potential adverse external opinion\nof failure than with the possible impact of uncertainties on the project [47] they\ndowngrade their actual perceived risk to a desired external accepted level of risk [48]\nthat can be \u201csafely\u201d engaged through risk management without the side effects of\n\u201cdread\u201d. Thus, in so far as risks that may have an influence on the project outcome are\nsuppressed, they are not managed for the sake of avoiding discomfort among\nstakeholders.\nSuspension of belief\nThe previous types of irrelevance are in line with Smithson\u2019s [1] taxonomy of\nirrelevance. This study provides a detailed consideration of their manifestation in the\ncontext of project risk management. However, a further type of irrelevance emerged.\nThis type does not refer to a double or dubious \u2018message\u2019 (undecidability), or\ninformation that is perceived as inconvenient (taboo), or to information that\nstakeholders deem \u2018out-of-scope\u2019 (untopicality). Rather, this was where risk-related\n18\ninformation was regarded as being \u2018useless\u2019 because it did not have an immediate effect\non the project. This was brought up by a number of interviewees, for example:\n\u201cIn this particular environment, it was one that was used to \"flying by the seats of its\npants\" and managing issues and crisis as they arrived rather than actually taking the\ntime and stand back and look ahead and say \"What can we do to prevent that?\".\u201d\n(Interviewee 5)\n\u201cIn that particular organisation, once a risk had transpired it was all hands to the\npump and they did what needed doing. That was the culture of the organisation to\nfire fight and run by crisis management.\u201d (Interviewee 14)\nHence, the project managers distanced themselves from this type of information\nbecause the perception was that they were dealing with some kind of \u2018fiction\u2019. They did\nnot want to expend resources on dealing with anything other than \u2018facts\u2019:\n\u2026 if it did [risk materialised], we could get round it somehow (Interviewee 1)\nWhereas on the one hand, some stakeholders\u2019 preference lies in identifying, analysing\nand responding in advance, other stakeholders appear to wait until risk resolves itself\n[49] and to react to actual materialising risks. Smallman [50] summarises the apparent\nemphasis of risk actors on reactive risk management: \u201cIt is hardly surprising that\nreactive risk management is dominant at the present time; it is, apparently, more certain\nand easier to manage and cost than the holistic approach.\u201d Their preference may lie in\nsaving costs and time by reducing the scope of risk management rather than trying to\nmanage all possible risks with the purpose of reducing the possibility of adverse\nconsequences on the project objectives of cost, scope and time [51].\nExecuting actions to mitigate risks requires the commitment of resources, such as time\nand money. Resources are committed in advance to respond to risks that are not certain\nto occur but the client\/owner or sponsor may be unwilling to spend money and energy\n19\non a management process without knowing it has definite benefits [23]. Raz and\nMichael [3] mention: \u201cOne of the reasons we included this part is that we met many\nproject managers who claimed that risk management was an unnecessary activity, and\nthat the resources it required could be put to better use elsewhere in the project.\u201d As a\nconsequence, referring to the concept off \u2018satisficing\u2019 [52], project managers tended to\nmeet the criteria for adequacy, rather than to identify the optimal solution. Information\nwas not deemed pertinent because what can be done now to resolve a fictional problem\nis considered to require greater resources than doing something about facts. Possible\nexplanations for \u2018satisficing\u2019 maybe a myopic propensity towards project efficiency.\nProject managers are nonchalant about risk related information because although the\ncosts of taking actions to manage \u2018fictional\u2019 risk are immediately visible, the effect of\nthreats that may or may not impact the project outcome is not.\nAs a working definition, this new project management related type of irrelevance is\ndescribed as the act of suspending one\u2019s belief in risk related information and refers to\nplacing such information at a lower order. This type of irrelevance is different to\nundecidability. If we assume that knowledge claims about a risk remain intact, that is to\nsay, risk actors share a common belief that a risk is \u2018true\u2019, claims are still suspended\nbecause the utility (e.g. defined by cost, time, comfort, convenience, habits etc.) to do\nsomething about it now is perceived to be lower than the utility to deal with information\nonce it is confirmed by \u2018real\u2019 events.\nIrrelevance and perceived effectiveness of project risk management\nWe have identified four types of irrelevance (as a subset of ignorance) that have impacts\nof the management of risks in projects. Three could be correlated to Smithson\u2019s [1]\ntaxonomy and to these we added \u2018suspension of belief\u2019. We found that they were\npresent in many of the projects mentioned by the interviewees and that, in some cases,\nthe interviewees had experienced several types of irrelevance on the same project.\n20\nHowever, we also wanted to examine the impact of irrelevance on the effectiveness of\nproject risk management.\n21\nTable 4 presents data on the perceived effectiveness of management activity at six\nstages in the risk management process. We have used a code to indicate the nature of\nthe effect and then indicated the types of irrelevance that were identified in each case.\n22\nTable 4: Summed indices - perceived effectiveness of project risk management stages and related\ntypes of error and irrelevance\nProject Planning Identify\nThreat\nAttach\nProbability\nDetermine\nEffects\nEvaluate\nResponse\nDetermine\nResponse\nOwner\nExecute\nActions\nIrrelevance\nInterviewee1 NA X \u2191 \u2191 X X\nS, UT, UD\nInterviewee 2 NA X X \u2191 NA NA \u2191\nUT, UD, T\nInterviewee 3 NA \u2191 \u2191 NA \u2191 \u2191\nInterviewee 4 NA \u2191 \u2191 \u2191 \u2191 X\nInterviewee 5 X - n X - n X - n X - n X - n X - n X - n S\nInterviewee 6 X - n X - n X - n X - n X - n X - n X - n T\nInterviewee 7 \u2191 X NA\nUD\nInterviewee 8 \u2191 X X X X X X\nUD, UT\nInterviewee 9 \u2191 X X \u2191 X \u2191\nT, UT\nInterviewee 10 \u2191 \u2191 X \u2191 \u2191 X\nUD, UT\nInterviewee 11 \u2191 X X X X NA X\nS\nInterviewee 12 \u2191 X X X X\nS\nInterviewee 13 NA X X NA X X X UD, UT, T\nInterviewee 14 NA \u2191 X NA NA X X\nS\nInterviewee 15 \u2191 NA \u2191\nInterviewee 16 X \u2191 X \u2191 X NA\nUT\nInterviewee 17 NA X NA NA NA X X S\nInterviewee 18 X - n X - n X - n X - n X - n X - n X - n T\nPerceived effectiveness:\n\u2191 = Effective\nX = Not effective\nX - n = no effectiveness - No project risk management applied\nNA = Data not available\nBlank = No unambiguous effectiveness cited\nIrrelevance:\nUT- Untopicality\nS \u2013 Suspension (Cost\/Time)\nT \u2013 Taboo\nUD \u2013 Undecideablity\nWithout ignoring the influence of error on the perceived effectiveness of project risk\nmanagement, irrelevance seemed to adversely influence the process of the management\nof risk on the projects our interviewees mentioned. In particular, the inability to decide\nwhether risk related information was true or false was found to be of concern when\nanalysing probabilities. Meanwhile, taboos seemed to have an impact on the phase of\nplanning the risk management process and identifying threats. Elsewhere, untopicality\nbecame a problem at the stage of defining a response owner. We found suspension of\nbelief manifested itself as a type of cost\/time subordination, which had an impact right\n23\nat the outset in deciding whether or not to apply a formal risk management process.\nOnce, the decision was taken subordination reduced the capability of a project manager\nto define response alternatives and to ultimately execute actions. Overall, due to the\ninfluence of irrelevance at various stages of the project risk management process, the\ncapability of some project managers to manage risk seemed to be reduced to a \u2018tick-\nbox\u2019 exercise with little significance on the actual mitigation of risk:\n\u201c\u2026 people would see it merely as putting a tick in the box. Yes, we are doing a\nproject risk assessment.\u201d (Interviewee 13)\n\u201c\u2026it becomes an administrative process and as long people feel there is a risk\nregister somewhere and lip services paid to in on a reasonably frequent basis that\nthey are managing risk.\u201d (Interviewee 17)\nRisk related information is processed because project manager are supposed to follow\nthe formal procedures despite a feeling of powerlessness and alienation. In the extreme,\nfatalistic tendencies resulted in pure defiance and a resistance to apply any form of\nproactive management of risk (in, for example, the cases of interviewees 5, 6 and 18).\nThe management of relevance\nAlthough ignorance, in the form of irrelevance, may not arise in all projects but may\npotentially arise in any given project, this study has highlighted how established types\nof irrelevance manifest themselves in project management, together with another\ncategory which we called suspension of belief. Coping with ignorance requires\nresponding to errors and irrelevancies. This study has allowed an extended\nunderstanding of ignorance in project management so that strategies can be\nimplemented to help optimise project risk management process. This entails the\nmanagement of relevance.\n24\nWhereas error requires clarification, exactitude and rectification through enquiry,\nirrelevance in project risk management can be overcome through the management of\nrelevance that defines the extent of information exclusion. The overall aim of the\nmanagement of relevance is limiting the exclusion of risk and ultimately to reduce\nfatalistic tendencies in project risk management. Barriers of untopicaility,\nundecidability, taboo and suspension of belief have to be overcome. From the data, it\nwould appear that when addressing risk information, managers are most likely to\nconsider topicality first, then truthfulness and finally utility. Against these concepts we\nhave mapped the four categories of irrelevance, as shown in Figure 2.\nFigure 2: A multi stage process of relevance evaluation [30]\nFirst, untopicality requires stakeholders to define a common scope of risk management.\nThis may include the mindfulness of being able to only process tame risks and that\nwicked messes are to be excluded. Defining a common nominator for what type of\nthreats stakeholders are looking for prevents risks being \u2018off-topic\u2019 and therefore\nirrelevant.\n25\nOnce risks have been defined as \u2018on topic\u2019 and a common view as emerged of what\nscope is acceptable, trust has to been built up that allows an agreement on what risks are\nconsidered \u2018true\u2019 and which \u2018false\u2019. If a common belief in the nature of project risk is\nnot gained, it may be decided to gain further data in order to engage establish why risks\nare seen as incomplete and irrelevant.\nThe final stage relates to the evaluation of utility. Considering time and cost constraints,\nproject managers evaluate the usefulness of risk information. Preferences to mitigate\nrisk, to prevent anxiety by disclosing damaging information to oneself or other\nstakeholders and the propensity towards myopic efficiency are prioritised and ultimately\ndetermine the degree of relevance of project risks in IT projects regardless of their\nobjective degree of error.\nThe management of relevance proposes a determination of relevance and to which\nextent risk related information is excluded in a world characterised by uncertain\nboundaries. Almost every risk may be of interest, but the management of risk requires\ninformation about threat, probability and response. Current project risk management\nprocesses do not propose any prescriptive process to define the relevance of risk apart\nfrom a ranking of risks according to their threat and their likelihood of occurrence. The\ndiscovered four principles and their management may guide a project manager to first,\nto create awareness about irrelevance and second, how to overcome it.\nThere are two major limitations of this study. First, the sample of the second phase of\nexploration which included a narrow segment of IT project managers. Second, limited\ngeneralisabilty arises through the use of subjective data. In particular, the IT project\nmanager\u2019s reality which has been investigated in this study may not be transferable to\nother individuals. As a consequence, tendencies which have emerged and been explored\ncannot be generalised beyond the chosen sample cluster. As a result, it may be\n26\nworthwhile to determine whether the same types of irrelevance prevail in other types of\nprojects and in what form.\nCONCLUSIONS\nProject risk management with its assumptions of \u2018hyper rationality\u2019 excludes many\naspects of managerial behaviour. Organisations such as the Project Management\nInstitute or the Association of Project Management claim that through the identification,\nanalysis and response to risk, project managers can achieve planned project outcomes.\nLittle research has been undertaken to ascertain whether project managers involved in\nrisk management activity perceive the self-evidently correct processes and procedures\nthey implement to be effective. There seems to be far more literature offering\nprescriptions to project managers on how to manage risk in project rather than assess\nthe relative effectiveness of those prescriptions. Neither the shortcomings of current\nproject risk management processes nor options to change and\/or expand those best\npractice standards to include behavioural aspects of irrelevance have received much\nattention in literature so far. As long as no evidence is produced, whether project risk\nmanagement actually helps project managers from their point of view (\u2018doing things\nright\u2019), the acceptance of best practice project risk management standards is at stake\n(\u2018doing the right things\u2019).\nThe findings of this study show that in some projects, project risk management is\nconditioned by deliberate ignorance of project managers. The factors of untopicality,\nundecidabilty and utility of risk related information characterised by taboos and\nsuspension of belief appear to demote risk management to an administrative exercise\nhaving no or only little impact on the project outcome. Indeed, if irrelevance remains\nunattended by project managers, project risk management might turn out to be not only\nineffective but also counterproductive.\n27\nThe research undertaken involved projects specifically from the IT industry and, as\nsuch, the extent to which the findings are more generally applicable to, say, engineering,\nconstruction or change projects is open to question. The specific nature of the project\n(industrial sector, complexity, size, etc.[53]) is less likely to be an issue. Rather, the\ngeneralisability would, in this case, be limited by the character of the social conditions\nfound in different project types. We would argue that it is the social conditions (such as\norganizational and, maybe, national culture) that would govern the response of project\nactors to the way they regard the relevance of project risk information. The question\nthen becomes one of whether projects from, for example, different industries, or\nprojects of differing complexities, have different cultures. Future research could\nexamine this question as well as seek to validate the categories of irrelevance across a\nwider sample of projects.\n28\nREFERENCES\n[1] M. Smithson, Ignorance and Uncertainty.
