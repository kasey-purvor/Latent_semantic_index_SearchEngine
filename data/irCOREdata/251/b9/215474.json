What are the consequences thereof for the meaning of law? Under what conditions is the language of war necessary for capturing the demands on law in times of transition? By examining the evolution of \u2018war talk\u2019 and \u2018law talk\u2019, and the implications thereof for \u2018rights talk\u2019, this article examines the promise \u2013 and limits \u2013 of transformative law, with particular reference to recent developments in the United States. From the \u2018war on poverty\u2019 to the \u2018war on crime\u2019 and from the \u2018war on drugs\u2019 to the \u2018war on terrorism\u2019, the practice of law in the United States has taken its cue from the language of war. To ascertain the meaning of language, this article provides a discourse analysis of law \u2013 and war \u2013 in times of transition. The article introduces modes of analogical reasoning and demonstrates the importance of analysing language for understanding law and public policy. The analysis shows that decision-makers use analogies not simply to justify law and public policy (what I term rhetoric) but also to perform specific cognitive and information-processing tasks essential to decision-making (what I term reason). Applying this framework for analysis to the case at hand, the article traces the emergence of the \u2018war on terrorism\u2019 and explains, first, how the language of war informed US responses to the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 and delineates, second, the consequences thereof for political rights and civil liberties","downloadUrl":"","fullTextIdentifier":null,"pdfHashValue":null,"publisher":"Oxford University Press","rawRecordXml":"<record><header><identifier>\n    \n    \n      oai:eprints.lse.ac.uk:29271<\/identifier><datestamp>\n      2010-10-01T09:37:21Z<\/datestamp><setSpec>\n      74797065733D4445505453:4C53452D4952<\/setSpec><\/header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:oai_dc=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/\" xmlns:dc=\"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/\" xmlns:xsi=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/ http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc.xsd\" ><dc:relation>\n    \n      \n        http:\/\/eprints.lse.ac.uk\/29271\/<\/dc:relation><dc:title>\n        Analogies at war<\/dc:title><dc:creator>\n        Meierhenrich, Jens<\/dc:creator><dc:subject>\n        JZ International relations<\/dc:subject><dc:description>\n        What is war, as we now use the term?
