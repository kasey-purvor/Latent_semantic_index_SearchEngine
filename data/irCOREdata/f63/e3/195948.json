As far as I know, my Bachelor thesis was\nthe first trial to apply \u201cH\u221e signal reconstruction via sampled-data control theory\u201d to\nactual audio data processing. I was extremely impressed to see the transdisiplinary\naspect of system control theory. This invaluable experience is a source of my desire\nto contribute to other fields outside of the control community. Fortunately, I became\nacquainted with the second author whose speciality is probability theory and math-\nematical finance.

To model such shifts, one would like to employ\nstochastic differential equations where the underlying randomness contains jumps.\nFor this purpose, the diffusion process is not sufficient since its sample paths are al-\nmost surely continuous. On the other hand, Le\u00b4vy-driven stochastic differential equa-\ntions, which contain diffusion as a special case, can formulate stochastic behavior\nwith jumps. Regardless of its practical importance, however, the theory and the com-\nputational techniques of the Le\u00b4vy processes have not been developed thoroughly as\nin the diffusion case. As nice references on the subject, we refer to Applebaum [1].\nFrom a practical point of view, the sample paths approximation of stochastic\ndifferential equations has been a central issue for the purpose of numerical evalua-\ntion and simulation on the computer. There are two notions of the approximation;\nstrong and weak approximations. The strong approximation schemes provide path-\nwise approximations which can be employed in scenario analysis, filtering or hedge\nsimulation. For applications such as derivative pricing, the computation of moments\nor expected utilities, the so-called weak approximations are sufficient, that is, we\nneed to estimate the expected value of a function. Other applications of the weak\napproximation include the computation of functional integrals, invariant measures,\nand Lyapunov exponents.\nThe theoretical properties of time discretization schemes are mostly studied for\nthe diffusion case. See [6] for detailed investigation. In fact, the weak approximation\nof the Le\u00b4vy-driven stochastic differential equations via Monte Carlo type methods\nis still very difficult. Moreover, the other existing methods are applicable only to\nsome of the simplest Le\u00b4vy processes. The main purpose of this paper is to propose\na new approach to weak approximation of Le\u00b4vy-driven stochastic differential equa-\ntions. Unlike Monte Carlo simulation with the time discretization approximation of\nsample paths, we employ a mathematical programming framework to obtain numer-\nically upper and lower bounds of the target expectation.\nTo this end, we follow the methodologies investigated in various fields of ap-\nplication by several authors, for example, Bertsimas, Popescu and Sethuraman [2],\nHelmes, Ro\u00a8hl and Stockbridge [4], Lasserre, Prieto-Rumeau and Zervos [8], to men-\ntion just a few.2. Note that these results deal only with the pure diffusion case (i.e.,\nwithout jump component) for which standard Monte Carlo methods are sufficient. In\nthis sense, it should be emphasized that our result is not a trivial extension. The main\ndrawback is the complexity of the Ito formula for Le\u00b4vy-driven stochastic differential\nequations. As such, we need to carefully examine whether or not the resulting opti-\n2 It is known that there exist two dual formulation of this framework, both of which arrive at a semi-\ndefinite programming in the end. One is the so-called generalized moment problem that makes use\nof the semi-definiteness of (localizing) moment matrices. The other is a polynomial optimization\napproach for which sum-of-squares relaxation efficiently works. In this paper, our discussion is\nbased on the latter formulation.\nAn optimization approach to weak approximation of Le\u00b4vy-driven SDE 3\nmization problems are practically solvable. Fortunately, as we show in the following\nsections, our approach covers various practically important Le\u00b4vy-driven stochastic\ndifferential equations.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives mathematical def-\ninition of Le\u00b4vy-driven stochastic differential equations. Section 3 introduces and\nstudies our optimization approach to the weak approximation. Section 4 provides\na numerical example to illustrate that our method is able to efficiently capture the\nmarginal distributions of Le\u00b4vy-driven stochastic differential equations. Finally, Sec-\ntion 5 concludes this paper.\n2 Problem formulation\nLet us begin this section with general notations which will be used throughout the\ntext. For k 2 N, \u2202k indicates the partial derivative with respect to k-th argument. We\ndenote by Ck1;k2 the class of continuous functions with continuous differentiability\nof k1-time for the first argument and of k2-time for the second argument.\nLet X0 be given in R and let T > 0. Consider a one-dimensional stochastic dif-\nferential equation\ndXt = a0 (t;Xt)dt +a1 (t;Xt)dWt +\nZ\nR0\nb(t;Xt\u00a1;z)(\u00b5\u00a1\u03bd)(dz;dt) ; t 2 [0;T ];\nwhere fWt : t \u00b8 0g is a standard Brownian motion and where \u00b5 is a Poisson ran-\ndom measure on R0 whose compensator is given by the Le\u00b4vy measure \u03bd satisfyingR\njzj>1 jzj\u03bd(dz) < +\u221e and\nR\nR0(jzj2 ^ 1)\u03bd(dz) < +\u221e. In order for the solution of (1)\nto be well defined, we impose the usual Lipschitz conditions and linear growth con-\nditions on a0, a1 and b. We henceforth equip our underlying probability space with\nthe natural filtration (Ft)t2[0;T ] generated by fXt : t 2 [0;T ]g. Moreover, throughout\nthis study, we assume that b(t;x;z) 6= 0 and \u03bd 6= 0 to avoid triviality.\nOur interest throughout this study is in approximating the expectation\nE [V (XT )] : (1)\nHere, V is a function mapping from [0;T ]\u00a3R to R, piecewise polynomial in t and\nx and such that E[jV (XT )j] < +\u221e. Note that the function V may have discontinu-\nities. For the computation ofE[V (XT )], standard techniques include the Monte Carlo\nsimulation of sample paths through the time discretization of stochastic differential\nequations, or even some exact knowledge of sample paths such as series representa-\ntion of the Poisson jump component.\n4 Kenji Kashima and Reiichiro Kawai\n3 Optimization approach to weak approximation\n3.1 Ito formula and supermartingale\nWe are now in a position to introduce our optimization approach to the weak ap-\nproximation. Let X (\u00b5 R) be a support of fXt : t 2 [0;T ]g defined in (1). For\nf 2C1;2([0;T ]\u00a3X ;R), the Ito formula yields\nd f (t;Xt) =A f (t;Xt)dt +\u22022 f (t;Xt)a1(Xt)dWt\n+\nZ\nR0\nBz f (t;Xt\u00a1)(\u00b5\u00a1\u03bd)(dz;dt); a:s:;\nwhere\nA f (t;x) :=\u22021 f (t;x)+\u22022 f (t;x)a0(x)+ 12\u2202\n2\n2 f (t;x)a1(x)2\n+\nZ\nR0\n(Bz f (t;x)\u00a1\u22022 f (t;x)b(x;z))\u03bd(dz):\nand for z 2 R0,\nBz f (t;x) := f (t;x+b(x;z))\u00a1 f (t;x) :\nHere, if\nE\n\u00b7Z T\n0\n(\u22022 f (t;Xt)a1(t;Xt))2dt\n\u00b8\n<+\u221e;\nand if\nE\n\u00b7Z T\n0\nZ\nR0\n(Bz f (t;Xt)a1(t;Xt))2\u03bd(dz)dt\n\u00b8\n<+\u221e; (2)\nthen the stochastic process\u00bd\nf (t;Xt)\u00a1 f (0;X0)\u00a1\nZ t\n0\nA f (s;Xs)ds : t 2 [0;T ]\n\u00be\nis a square-integrable martingale with respect to the filtration. We can then derive\none of important building blocks of our approach, the so-called Dynkin formula:\nE [ f (T;XT )]\u00a1 f (0;X0) = E\n\u00b7Z T\n0\nA f (s;Xs)ds\n\u00b8\n: (3)\nHence, as soon as one finds an f 2C1;2([0;T ]\u00a3X ;R) such that\u00bd\nA f (t;x) \u00b7 0; (t;x) 2 [0;T ]\u00a3X ;\nf (t;x) \u00b8 V (x); x 2X ; (4)\nit follows\nE [V (XT )]\u00b7 E [ f (T;XT )]\u00b7 f (0;X0): (5)\nAn optimization approach to weak approximation of Le\u00b4vy-driven SDE 5\nClearly, f (0;X0) serves as an upper bound of E[V (XT )]. To minimize the upper\nbound f (0;X0), we now turn to the optimization problem\nmin f (0;X0)\ns:t: f (t;x)\u00b8V (x); x 2X ;\nA f (t;x)\u00b7 0; (t;x) 2 [0;T ]\u00a3X ;\nf 2C1;2([0;T ]\u00a3X ;R):\n3.2 Main result\nThis optimization problem is very difficult to deal with since the class definitions of\nthe functions f and V are too broad. To ease the above optimization problem, we\nrestrict the class of the function f to be a polynomial both in t and x, that is, in the\nform\nf (t;x) = \u2211\nf0\u00b7k1\u00b7K1;0\u00b7k2\u00b7K2g\nck1;k2t\nk1 xk2 ; (6)\nfor some natural numbers K1 and K2 and for a sequence fck1;k2gk1\u00b7K1;k2\u00b7K2 of con-\nstants. For convenience in notation, we henceforth denote by Cp the class of polyno-\nmial functions in the form (6). We also need to set V to be a piecewise polynomial\nboth in t and x. Moreover, we assume that both a0 and a1 are polynomials. We are\nthen instead to solve the following optimization problem\nmin f (0;X0)\ns:t: f (t;x)\u00b8V (x); x 2X ;\nA f (t;x)\u00b7 0; (t;x) 2 [0;T ]\u00a3X ;\nf 2Cp:\n(7)\nFor the purpose of comparison, suppose that there is no jump in (1), that is, b\u00b4 0\nas in [11]. This assumption clearly makesA f a polynomial, and consequently (7) is\na polynomial optimization problem. This is the main reason that the pure diffusion\ncase is easier to deal with in this framework. In general, polynomial optimization\nproblems are still NP hard. However, if the degrees of f are fixed, sums of squares\nrelaxation enables us to solve the problem efficiently. For details, we refer to Parrilo\n[9]. On the other hand, this technique is not directly applicable to the model with\ngeneral stochastic jumps. This is because A f is not necessarily a polynomial due\nto the additional integral term.\nTo circumvent this difficulty, we decompose the function b as follows:\nAssumption 1 Functions a0 and a1 are polynomials, and b is decomposed as\nb(t;x;z) = b1(t;x)b2(z);\nwhere b1 is a polynomial in x and where b2 : R0 7!

Under Assumption 1, for any f 2 Cp, A f is a polynomial in t and x.\nMoreover, the coefficients of A f are affine with respect to those of f .\nProof: A simple algebra yields\nA f (t;x) = \u22021 f (t;x)+\u22022 f (t;x)a0(t;x)+ 12\u2202\n2\n2 f (t;x)a1(t;x)2\n+ \u2211\nf0\u00b7k1\u00b7K1;2\u00b7k2\u00b7K2g\nck1;k2t\nk1\nk2\u00a12\u2211\nk=0\nk2Ckx\nkb1(t;x)k2\u00a1kMk2\u00a1k\nwhere\nMl :=\nZ\nR0\nb2(z)l\u03bd(dz); l = 2; : : : ;K2:\nThis completes the proof. \u00a4\nClearly, the optimization (7) is now a polynomial programming problem. To be\nmore precise, this problem is numerically tractable for any piecewise polynomial\nV . Finally, to obtain a lower bound for E[V (XT )], we are to find a g 2 Cp via the\npolynomial programming\nmax g(0;X0)\ns:t: g(t;x)\u00b7V (x); x 2X ;\nA g(t;x)\u00b8 0; (t;x) 2 [0;T ]\u00a3X ;\ng 2Cp:\n(8)\nNotice that our optimization approach does not require the sample paths simula-\ntion at all for the computation of the expectation E[V (XT )]. It is a great advantage\nof our approach that all we need is the Le\u00b4vy measure in closed form, not the ex-\nact knowledge of the increments or of a shot noise representation for sample paths\nsimulation for the weak approximation with the sample paths discretization.\n3.3 Simultaneous approximation for homogeneous process\nIn this section, we show that the optimal solution obtained through our approach\nprovides some additional information, that are of direct practical use.\nFirstly, note that the initial value X0 does not appear in the constraints (4) in\nthe previous section. Therefore, if f satisfies (4), f (0; x\u02dc) automatically gives upper\nbounds for Ex\u02dc [V (XT )], where the notation Ex denotes the expectation taken under\nwhich the initial state of the stochastic differential equation (1) is given determinis-\ntically by X0 = x.\nAn optimization approach to weak approximation of Le\u00b4vy-driven SDE 7\nThe next theorem indicates that functions satisfying (4) can also serve as bounds\nat arbitrary intermediate time points.\nTheorem 2. Assume that (1) is time-homogeneous, i.e., a1, a2, and b are indepen-\ndent of t. Suppose that f 2C1;2 satisfies (4).

When we attempt to as tight bounds for (1) as possible, we\nshould solve (7) and (8). However, we need to approximate V (X\n\u00afT ) for some differ-\nent time points \u00afT 2 [0;T ] and also different initial value X0, it is useful to suitably\nchange the cost function. Fortunately, for suitable measure \u03c6 on [0;T ]\u00a3R, we can\nsimilarly optimize Z\nf (t;s)\u03c6(dt;ds);\nZ\ng(t;s)\u03c6(dt;ds);\nsince these are linear combination of the decision variables (the coefficients of f\nand g).\n4 Numerical Examples\nIn this section we give some approximation examples. In the numerical examples\npresented hereafter, we utilize MATLAB SOSTOOLS combined with SeDuMi [10,\n14], using a computer with a Pentium 4 3.2GHz processor and 2 GB memory.\n8 Kenji Kashima and Reiichiro Kawai\n4.1 Ornstein-Uhlenbeck-type process with gamma stationary\ndistribution\nLet \u03bd be a Le\u00b4vy measure on R+ such that\nR\nR+ z\u03bd(dz) < +\u221e.

Then, the stochastic differential equation (1) reduces to\ndXt =\u00a1\u03bbXtdt +\nZ\nR+\nz\u00b5(dz;dt);\nwhich is called an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck-type process. (See, for example, Sato [13]\nfor its details.) Its solution is given by\nXt = e\u00a1\u03bb tX0 +\nZ t\n0\nZ\nR+\ne\u00a1\u03bb (t\u00a1s)z\u00b5(dz;ds):\nFor simplicity, we further fix X0 = 0, \u03bb = 1 and \u03bd(dz) = bae\u00a1bzdz, where a > 0 and\nb > 0. Then, we can prove that the stationary distribution of fXt : t \u00b8 0g is gamma\nwith density p(x) = ba=\u0393 (a)xa\u00a11e\u00a1bx, x 2 R+.\nHere, we investigate the distribution transition via the moment estimations of\nE[Xt ] = (1\u00a1e\u00a1t)a=b,E[X2t ] = (1\u00a1e\u00a12t)a=b2+(1\u00a1e\u00a1t)2a2=b2, and limt\"+\u221eE[Xkt ] =\n\u0393 (a+ k)=(bk\u0393 (a)), for k 2 N.

We set K1 = p for the estimation of the\np-th moment. It is known that the computational burden for solving the polynomial\noptimization via sum of squares decomposition significantly increases as the degree\nof the polynomial becomes larger. In view of this, we choose large K2 = 10. Even\nin this case, however, computation time is at most 2 seconds. For comparison with\nMonte Carlo methods, we also provide 99%-confidence interval with 1000000 iid\nsamples. As can be observed, even with the extraordinarily large number of samples,\nAn optimization approach to weak approximation of Le\u00b4vy-driven SDE 9\nthe 99%-confidence intervals are far from being comparable with our results. Note\nthat any large sample size can never be in competition with our results since the\nupper and lower bounds obtained through our method form nothing but the 100%-\nconfidence interval.\nt = 1 t = 2 t = 3 t \"+\u221e\nE [Xt ]\n0.042141 \u2013 0.042141 0.057644 \u2013 0.057644 0.063347 \u2013 0.063348\n(0.042141) (0.057644) (0.063348) (0.06667)\n[0.0417327, 0.0427467] [0.0569853, 0.0580576] [0.0628788, 0.0639666]\nE\n\u00a3\nX2t\n\u00a4 0.040205 \u2013 0.040205 0.046952 \u2013 0.046955 0.048331 \u2013 0.048347(0.040205) (0.046953) (0.048347) (0.04889)\n[0.0396179, 0.0414835] [0.0457206, 0.0476003] [0.0476659, 0.0496044]\nE\n\u00a3\nX3t\n\u00a4 0.061217 \u2013 0.061268 0.066812 \u2013 0.066886 0.068009 \u2013 0.068051(n\/a) (n\/a) (n\/a) (0.06844)\n[0.0591606, 0.0649658] [0.0633623, 0.0688394] [0.0660050, 0.0719257]\nTable 1 Moment transition with X0 = 0 and (a;b) = (0:1;1:5).

The advantage of our approach\nis that all we need is the Le\u00b4vy measure in closed form. We need neither the exact\nknowledge of the increments nor a shot noise representation for sample path simu-\nlation for the weak approximation with the sample path discretization. We have also\ninvestigated how we can obtain accurate approximation at transient times.\nThe most important remaining work is the improvement of the approximation\naccuracy. It is a good direction to pursue to use exponentially tempered polynomials\n[5]. Other currently ongoing work is\n\u00b2 application to calibration in finance,\n\u00b2 construction of finite-horizon control theory for systems described by Le\u00b4vy\ndriven stochastic differential equations.\nReferences\n1.
