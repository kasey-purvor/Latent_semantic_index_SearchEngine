Introduction\nEvery year the global energy demand increases. While petroleum products currently\nsupply much of this demand, the increasing difficulty of sustained supply and the\nassociated problems of pollution and global warming are acting as a major impetus for\nresearch into alternative renewable energy technologies. Fuel cells offer a possible\n(and partial) solution to this problem, with the fuel needed for conventional cells\nusually being either hydrogen or methanol, although some cells have been developed\nwhich run on other fuels such as hydrocarbons [de Bruijn 2005, Bagotzky et al 2003].\nHydrogen is gaseous and this gives rise to storage and transport problems. Moreover\nmany of the alternative fuels that could be used within fuel cells are still dependent on\npetroleum products and therefore offer few advantages. It is clear that approaches by\nwhich common waste materials and the chemical energy locked within them could be\nutilised would offer many benefits. For example, if a molecule of glucose is oxidised\ncompletely to CO2, (usually with atmospheric O2 providing the oxidant), there are 24\nelectrons available for current generation. Furthermore, if the glucose is produced as a\nby-product of photosynthesis, then the process is carbon neutral, which clearly offers\nenvironmental benefits.\nEver since Galvani first noticed the twitching of a frog\u2019s leg upon application of an\nelectric current, it has been known that many biological pathways have a\nbioelectrochemical facet. Since an electrical action can induce a biological reaction,\nthe converse in many cases is also true and in this way biological processes can be\nused to generate electricity. This would lead to the ability to utilise materials such as,\nfor example, lactose (from cheese making) to power electrical equipment. One of the\nearliest developments in this area was described by Michael Cresse Potter in 1910,\nwhen he placed a platinum electrode into cultures of yeast or E. Coli and showed that\na potential difference could be generated [Potter 1911]. Further work by Cohen at\nCambridge led to development of batteries of microbial fuel cells capable of\ngenerating potentials in excess of 35 volts [Cohen 1931].\nMore recently, there has been an upsurge in research in biofuel cells. Factors driving\nthis research include the increasing problems of supply and pollution that concern the\nuse of fossil fuels through to the possibilities offered by the design of small devices\nimplantable within the body - such as pacemakers. In many situations an ideal power\n3supply would be a fuel cell that was capable of running on the compounds such as\nsugars found in vivo. There are a number of reviews on bio-electrochemistry that\ninclude some coverage of work on biofuel cells including those by Aston and Turner\n[1984], Bennetto [1987], Katz et al [2003], Barton et al [2004], Shukla et al [2004]\nand Rabaey and Verstraete [2005a]. In 2006, the journal Biosensors and\nBioelectronics published a special issue devoted exclusively to biofuel cells, including\nseveral research papers and an extensive review of the field [Bullen et al 2006].\nThere are a number of biologically based fuel cell formats that at the time of writing\nare the focus of active research and include:\n1. Cells which use a primary fuel (usually an organic waste such as corn husks)\nand generate a material such as hydrogen, which is then used as a secondary\nfuel within a conventional hydrogen\/oxygen fuel cell.\n2. Cells which generate electricity directly from an organic fuel such as glucose,\nusing either enzymes or complete micro-organisms.\n3. Cells which combine the utilisation of photochemically active systems and\nbiological moieties to harvest the energy from sunlight and convert this into\nelectrical energy.\n2. Fuel cells based on conversion of organic waste to secondary fuels.\nThese are not \u201ctrue\u201d biofuel cells but represent a combination of a bioreactor and a\nfuel cell. One of the main attractions of this type of arrangement is that it can not only\ngenerate electrical power but also consumes a wide range of organic wastes (e.g. corn\nhusks, whey or noxious waste such as animal or human sewage). Fermentation\nprocesses can be used to produce substrates such as ethanol or hydrogen which can\nthen be used to power a conventional H2\/O2 or ethanol\/O2 fuel cell. Since there is no\ndirect generation of power by biological means, these types of cells fall outside the\nscope of this review.\n3. Biofuel cells which directly convert fuel to electricity.\n3.1. Early Work.\nCells of this type utilise biological moieties such as enzymes or living cells to directly\ngenerate power from the chemical energy contained within various organic or\ninorganic species. A schematic of a typical fuel cell of this format is shown in Fig. 1.\n4Two electrodes separated by a semi-permeable membrane are placed into solution. A\nbiological species such as a microbial cell or enzyme can either be in solution (or as a\nsuspension) within the anodic compartment of the cell - or alternatively be\nimmobilised at the electrode. Once a suitable fuel is introduced, it becomes either\npartially or totally oxidised at the anode and the electrons released by this process are\nused to reduce oxygen at the cathode. The early examples by Potter and Cohen\npreviously mentioned, utilised living cells as the active component. Later work [Davis\nand Yarborough 1962] involved adding either E. Coli or glucose oxidase to a half-cell\ncontaining glucose, which allowed small currents being generated. Much larger\ncurrents could be obtained upon addition of methylene blue to the system. This can be\nexplained by the electron transfer from micro-organisms to the electrode being a very\ninefficient process - and it follows that the presence of a simple mediator compound\nsuch as methylene blue greatly increases the efficiency of the cell. Further work\nutilised dichloroindophenol as a mediator in a glucose oxidase based cell, with\nefficiencies approaching 100% [Weibel and Dodge 1975]. A schematic of a typical\nmediated biological reaction, in this case the ferrocene mediated oxidation of glucose,\nis shown in Fig. 2.\nAn early paper by Rao et al [1976] describes much of the initial work focussed\ntowards developing glucose powered fuel cells for use within heart pacemakers.\nVarious fuel cell constructions were surveyed within this work, although only simple\ninorganic electrodes were used, with the best power outputs being obtained using\nPt\/Ni electrodes combined with polyacrylic acid\/polyvinyl alcohol copolymers. The\ndevices were very susceptible to poisoning by amino acids, although in vivo animal\ntests displayed good performance for up to 100 days.\nOnce the basic principle of the biofuel cell had been established, work could then\nprogress towards optimising the process. If a glucose molecule is completely reduced\nto CO2, there are potentially 24 electrons available, however, there exists no direct\nsimple chemical method to harvest this process. One approach is to exploit\nmicroorganisms that contain a range of enzymes to facilitate this transformation. For\nsimpler reaction pathways it is possible to utilise enzymes. Methanol for example, can\nbe oxidised to CO2 using just two enzymes [Aston and Turner 1984]. In this scheme\nmethanol can be oxidised by methanol dehydrogenase to give formaldehyde which\n5can then be further oxidised by formaldehyde dehydrogenase to CO2, with the overall\nprocess generating four electrons. Much of the work on methanol cells has already\nbeen reviewed [Aston and Turner 1984]. This group developed cells based on\nmethanol dehydrogenase along with phenazine etho-sulphate or tetramethyl\np-phenylenediamine mediators, the best of which gave power densities per electrode\narea of 2 \uf06dW cm-2 [Aston and Turner 1984, Turner et al 1982], providing the that\nanode compartment was kept anaerobic. Similar cells could also utilise carbon\nmonoxide as a fuel source [Turner et al 1982]. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide\n(NAD) could also be successfully used as a charge carrier between glucose\ndehydrogenase and a Meldola Blue activated anode [Persson et al 1986].\nLactose waste has been utilised as fuel [Roller et al 1983] for a microbial fuel cell\ncontaining thionine as the mediator. Providing the lactose consumed was continuously\nreplaced, the cell could produce a power output of 0.4 mW for over two weeks. A\nsimilar cell utilising glucose and E. Coli provided an electrical yield close to the\ntheoretical maximum of 48 faradays per mole of sucrose [Bennetto et al 1985].\n3.2 Enzyme based biofuel cells\nEnzyme based fuel cells have remained a popular focus for research due to the high\nturnover rates associated with enzymes that lead to a high biocatalysis turnover rate.\nOne problem associated with biofuel cells, however, is that although the biological\nmoieties will readily produce a supply of electrons, they cannot be exploited unless\nthey can be transferred to the electrode. Recent advances in the immobilisation of\nenzymes at electrode surfaces by a range of different methods [Davis and Higson\n2005, Scouten et al 1995] have greatly facilitated the transfer rate that can be\nachieved, making these molecules a more attractive prospect.\nAlthough much of the early attention was devoted to the study of reactions occurring\nat anodes, biological molecules can also be utilised to catalyse the reduction of\noxygen at the cathode as an alternative to the classical use of platinum.\nMicroperoxidase [Willner et al 1998a] can be immobilised onto a gold cathode and\nalong with a quinone modified cathode be utilised in a biofuel cell fuelled by NADH\nand H2O2. Similar cathodes were used along with apoglucose oxidase\/quinone\/flavin\n6adenine dinucleotide phosphate modified anode [Willner et al 1998b] to construct a\nglucose\/H2O2 fuel cell capable of generating 310 mV with a power output of 32 \uf06dW.\nThe same anodes and cathodes could also be utilised in a biofuel cell containing two\nimmiscible solvents with the anode being immersed in aqueous glucose and the\ncathode being immersed in cumene peroxide\/dichloromethane [Katz et al 1999a]. The\nresultant cells were reported to be capable of generating 1 V with a power output of\n520 \uf06dW.\nMany of the biofuel cells mentioned so far require separation of the anode and\ncathode into separate compartments, usually by means of a semipermeable membrane,\nsince quite often the fuels required for the separate reactions at the anode and cathode\nwill interfere with the reaction at the opposing electrode. However it has been shown\nthat suitably immobilised glucose oxidase molecules [Katz et al 1999b] give a rate of\nreaction (as measured by the anodic current), that is very close to the theoretical\nmaximum. This indicates very efficient electron transfer between the enzyme and the\nelectrode, thereby indicating that the presence of oxygen in the anodic environment\nwould not affect the bioelectrocatalytic activity of the enzyme. Following this\nreasoning, a fuel cell was constructed containing a glucose oxidase immobilised\nanode along with a cathode with cytochrome c and cytochrome oxidase covalently\nimmobilised at the surface [Katz et al 1999b]. This arrangement is known to\nelectrocatalyse the reduction of oxygen allowing rapid electron transfer to the\ncathode. The resultant cell which contained no separation of anode and cathode\ncompartments gave a power output of up to 4 \uf06dW, (when the cell solution was\nsaturated with oxygen and supplied with 1 mM glucose), with the power output being\nstable over a 48 hour period.\nFurther studies [Palmore and Kim 1999] also demonstrated the potential of using the\nfungal enzyme laccase along with a mediator to catalyse oxygen reduction within a\nH2\/O2 fuel cell. When fungal laccase was added to the cathode compartment of the\nfuel cell, it catalysed the reduction of oxygen at a glassy carbon cathode. The resultant\ncell gave a maximum power density of 42 \uf06dW cm-2 with a cell potential of 0.61 V,\nwhereas uncatalysed cells gave densities of 15 \uf06dW cm-2 - with a cell potential 0.26 V\n(Pt cathode) or 2.9 \uf06dW cm-2 at 0.28 V (using a glassy carbon cathode), thereby\n7demonstrating the enhanced reaction kinetics afforded by use of the enzyme. The\nreduction of hydrogen at graphite electrodes modified by a hydrogenase enzyme\n(from Allochromatium Vinosum) was also compared to a classical platinum electrode\n[Jones et al 2002]. Results showed the reduction at the enzyme electrode to be\ndiffusion controlled and match those obtained at the platinum electrode. These\nfindings were confirmed by other workers who also found that the enzyme based\nelectrodes could match the performance attainable at platinum electrodes [Karyakin et\nal 2002]. A hydrogenase enzyme immobilised onto a carbon filament electrode gave\nvery similar results when included in a H2\/O2 fuel cell and was found not to be\naffected by carbon monoxide, which can be a serious poison for conventional\nplatinum catalysts. A bilirubin oxidase \u201cwired\u201d carbon electrode [Mano et al 2003a]\nhas also been used to reduce oxygen to water at a much lower overpotential than that\nrequired at a platinum electrodes (at -0.31 V the current density for the enzyme\nelectrode was reported to be 9.5 mA cm-2; for the corresponding platinum electrode, a\ncurrent density 0.6 mA cm-2 is possible). The electrode could also be operated at\nphysiological pH, at which platinum tends to corrode and was found moreover to be\nmuch less susceptible to inhibition from chloride.\nOther work concerning methanol fuel cells has been focussed towards the problem of\nregeneration of the NAD cofactor often used with the dehydrogenase [Palmore et al\n1998]. In the majority of cases the oxidation of NADH requires potentials which\nlower the operating voltage of the cell. This reaction could be catalysed by the use of\ndiaphorase along with benzyl viologen. These materials along with dehydrogenase\nenzymes in solution were incorporated within methanol\/O2 fuel cells which were\nfound to be capable of giving a maximum power output of 670 \uf06dW cm-2 at 0.49 V vs\na standard calomel electrode (SCE).\nFor any type of implantable biofuel cell, it is important that it must operate under\nphysiological conditions (pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl, 37oC). \u201cWiring\u201d redox centres from\nbilirubin oxidase to a carbon electrode via a redox polymer [Mano et al 2002] gave\nrise to a cathode capable of reducing oxygen to water under physiological conditions,\nalbeit with a 5% loss in activity per day of operation. Other workers also immobilised\nbilirubin oxidase (cathode), and similarly glucose hydrogenase (anode), onto glassy\n8carbon modified with an Os-based redox polymer [Tsujimura et al 2002]. These\nelectrodes could be used in the construction of a one compartment glucose\/O2 biofuel\ncell, capable of operating under physiological conditions, with a maximum power\ndensity of 58 \uf06dW cm-2.\nFuel cells have the potential for high levels of miniaturisation due to their simplicity\nof construction without any moving parts. For example miniaturised methanol-air\n(non-biological) fuel cells with an active area of 0.25 cm2 were constructed using a\npolymer electrolyte rather than a solution and gave power densities similar to large\ncells [Kelley et al 2000]. However the active area was reduced by a factor of 60 [Chen\net al 2001] by these workers who used 2 cm x 7 \uf06dm carbon fibre electrodes with\nimmobilised glucose oxidase (anode) and laccase (cathode), both with immobilised\nosmium-containing polymers as electron transfer agents, held 400 \uf06dm apart on a\npolycarbonate support. This arrangement was immersed in an aerated 15 mM glucose\nsolution and was found to generate 64 \uf06dW cm-2 at 23oC and 137 \uf06dW cm-2 at 37oC,\npower densities which they claim were 5 and 10 times greater than any previously\nreported for glucose\/O2 fuel cells. This type of cell was improved by modification of\nthe redox polymers and utilising bilirubin oxidase as the cathodic enzyme to give 50\n\uf06dW cm-2 at an operating potential of 0.5 V under physiological conditions [Kim et al\n2003], although after two days continuous operation the current fell to 30 \uf06dW cm-2. A\nfuel cell of this type was found to produce a power output of up to 430 \uf06dW cm-2 at an\noperating potential of 0.52 V when implanted inside a living plant, namely a grape\n(Fig 3) [Mano et al 2003b]. Similar performance was also demonstrated in a\nphysiological solution [Heller 2004]. The operating voltage could be further increased\nto 0.78 V by using the enzyme laccase and modifying the redox polymer [Mano et al\n2003c]. Under physiological conditions a similar cell proved capable of generating 48\n\uf06dW cm-2 at an operating potential of 0.60 V [Mano et al 2004]. Inclusion of an eight\ncarbon atom chain between the redox functionality and the backbone of the polymer\nincreased the electron diffusion coefficient of the polymer 100-fold, leading to a\ncathode with superior oxygen reducing capabilities to platinum [Soukharev et al\n2004]. When this cathode was incorporated into a minature biofuel cell similar to\nthose above, operating voltages as high as 0.88 V could be obtained with a power\noutput of up to 350 \uf06dW cm-2.\n9As an alternative to the osmium based polymers above, a polymer containing\nVitamin-K3 was utilised to immobilise glucose dehydrogenase onto glassy carbon\n[Sato et al 2005]. The resultant glucose\/O2 cell was initially found to be capable of\ngenerating 14.5 \uf06dW cm-2 at 0.36 V at pH 7.0\/37oC, although after 4 days this fell to 4\n\uf06dW cm-2, but then remained stable for up to two weeks.\nA solid binding matrix based on graphite particles combined with enzymes and\nferrocene-based mediators which is spray-printed onto inert polymer films was\nutilised in the manufacture of electrodes for a glucose\/hydrogen peroxide fuel cell\n[Pizzareillo et al 2002]. Glucose oxidase and horseradish peroxidase were included in\nthe anode and cathode respectively to give a cell with a power output of 0.15 \uf06dW cm-2\nat an operating potential of 0.021 V (1 mM H2O2 and 1 mM glucose). This cell could\nbe operated continuously for up to 30 days. As an alternative to glucose, hydrolysed\ncorn syrup was successfully used as a fuel. The structure of the carbon electrodes used\nwithin these systems has been shown to have a major effect as shown by comparison\nof superdispersed colloid graphite and acetylene black electrodes [Tarasevich et al\n2003]. When laccase was immobilised on these electrodes, the rate of oxygen\nreduction per enzyme molecule at the graphite electrode was found to be five times\nhigher than that at the acetylene black electrode, and this is thought to be due to better\nmixing of the laccase and graphite due to the fact the enzyme molecules and the\ngraphite particles are very similar in size. Laccase was also immobilised at glassy\ncarbon electrodes along with either osmium or ruthenium based redox polymers, with\nthe osmium based polymer proving to be a more effective mediator of oxygen\nreduction in a membrane-less biofuel cell [Barriere et al 2004].\nLaccase has been the choice of enzyme for the comparison of glassy and porous\ncarbon to form biofuel cell cathodes [Farneth et al 2005], with the higher surface area\nof the porous carbons leading to x3-4 higher oxygen reduction currents when\nimmersed in a solution of laccase and mediator. Further work by the same group\nstudied encapsulation of the enzyme within silica or organic polymer binders onto\nporous carbon [Farneth and D\u2019Amore 2005]. The resultant cathodes can be\n10\nincorporated into a methanol biofuel cell and display a far superior stability behaviour\ncompared to cathodes where the laccase is simply adsorbed onto the carbon paper.\n[Tsujimura et al 2005] has described a system consisting of multilayers of bilirubin\noxidase and poly-L-lysine that can be deposited onto carbon electrodes. The resulting\nelectrodes were effective catalysts for oxygen reduction without the presence of a\nmediator, and under convective conditions, current densities for oxygen reduction of\nabout 1 mA cm-2 could be attained. It is thought that the bilirubin oxidase is diffusible\nwithin the multilayer. Another system capable of a mediator-less operation is one in\nwhich alcohol dehydrogenase is immobilised at the anode with glucose oxidase being\nco-deposited at the cathode along with microperoxidase [Ramanvicius et al 2005].\nThe reaction scheme for this mixture is for glucose to be enzymatically oxidised\nleading to the production of hydrogen peroxide at the anode, which is then\ncatalytically reduced and acts as the source of electrons used to oxidise ethanol at the\nanode. When both glucose and ethanol are present (10 mM) in solution, current\ndensities of 2.6 \uf06dA cm-2 can be attained, although the cell has a limited half-life of\napproximately 2.5 days. Carbon nanotubes have also been shown to be possible\nconstituents within anode materials for biofuel cells [Jung et al 2005]. Glucose\noxidase could be successfully immobilised on carboxylic acid substituted carbon\nnanotubes, leading to a system where electrons are transferred from the enzyme to a\ngraphite rod without the presence of a mediator. Other systems similar to this include\nmicroperoxidase immobilised onto carbon nanotubes which are in turn adsorbed onto\na platinum microelectrode [Wang et al 2005]. Direct electron transfer between the\nenzyme and the microelectrode and catalytic reduction of oxygen and hydrogen\nperoxide have been successfully demonstrated for this system and for a similar system\nin which a glassy carbon electrode was modified with a hybrid carbon nanotube\/gold\nnanoparticle mixture [Liu et al 2005a]. Porous carbon has also been used as a matrix\nto immobilise mixtures of carbon nanotubes with laccase (cathode) and glucose\noxidase (anode) to construct a glucose\/O2 biofuel cell [Liu et al 2005b]. Porous\ncarbon gave enhanced power production compared to glassy carbon electrodes. The\nresultant biofuel cell was also capable of operating at a range of pHs, from pH 4-7,\nwhich is unusual for laccase based electrodes which often will only function at pH\nvalues of <5. The power output was found to be dependent on pH falling from 99.8\n11\n\uf06dW cm-2 at pH=4 to 2.0 \uf06dW cm-2 at pH=7, thereby affording the possibility of\ncontrolling power output by controlling pH.\nConducting polymers can also be utilised as a method of immobilising enzymes in\nbiofuel cells. A variety of mutants of L-lactate dehydrogenase were successfully\nimmobilised on polyaniline\/polyvinyl sulphonate [Halliwell et al 2002] and were\nshown to display superior adsorption than a wild-type enzyme. Electrodes based on\nthese types of films were shown to be capable of current generation when exposed to\nlactose [Simon et al 2002]. Polyaniline films containing gold nanoparticles were also\ninvestigated [Granot et al 2005], both in the form of thin films and as rod structures.\nCharge transport within polyaniline\/Au nanoparticle composites were shown to be\nabout 25 times greater than in systems without nanoparticles. The high surface area of\nthese composites led to superior electron transfer mediator activity for the bioelectric\nactivation of the glucose\/glucose oxidase reaction.\nA biofuel cell with switchable output has been recently developed [Katz and Willner\n2003]. Incorporation of a Cu(II)-poly(acrylic acid) film between the electrodes and\nimmobilised glucose oxidase (anode), cytochrome oxidase (cathode) lead to a fuel cell\nwhich could be readily switched on and off. The Cu(II)-poly(acrylic acid) film acts as\nan insulating layer but can be reduced by application of a potential of -0.5 V (vs SCE)\npotential to Cu(0)-poly(acrylic acid) which is conductive - thereby activating the fuel\ncell (current density 550 \uf06dA cm-2). Subjecting the films to a +0.5 V (vs SCE) potential\nregenerated the insulating film, so enabling the switching of the fuel cell between the\nON and OFF states. The reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(0) is however quite slow, although\nthis allows for fine tuning of the film structure and so control of the power output of\nthe cell.\nThe use of mutant rather than wild-type enzymes has been studied [Yubashi et al\n2005]. Glucose dehydrogenase is ostensibly an excellent enzyme for biofuel cell\nanodes due to high turnover of substrate, with wide substrate specificity and also\ninsensitivity to oxygen. However the enzyme displays low stability, greatly shortening\nthe longevity of any resultant devices. A range of mutants were synthesised with one\nbeing found to be stable up to temperatures of 70oC [Yubashi et al 2005]. When\n12\nimmobilised onto carbon electrodes and placed in a biofuel cell along with a\ncarbon\/bilirubin oxidase cathode, power densities of 17.6 \uf06dW cm-2 could be obtained,\nwhich were similar those obtained from the wild type enzyme. The cell was, however,\nfound to have an operating lifetime of up to approximately 152 hours, six times that of\nthe cell constructed using the wild-type enzyme.\nThe performance of biofuel cells has been shown to be affected by magnetic fields.\nAnodes with either glucose oxidase or lactose dehydrogenase as the active biological\ncomponent and containing cathodes with cytochrome c\/cytochrome oxidase were\nconstructed and their performance when exposed to glucose, lactose or oxygen\ncharacterised with - and without application of a magnetic field parallel to the\nelectrode surface [Katz et al 2005]. A pronounced enhancement of the\nbioelectrocatalytic process is observed for both anodic systems although a far smaller\neffect was observed for the cathodic system. This enhancement was shown be due to a\nmagnetohydrodynamic effect which facilitates enhanced mass transport. When a fuel\ncell was constructed using the lactose dehydrogenase anode and the cytochrome\nc\/cytochrome oxidase cathode, its power output could be trebled by application of a\n0.92 T magnetic field [Katz et al 2005].\nA topic that has been the subject of much research recently is the development of\nmicrochip sized devices. The lack of integrated power supplies for powering devices\nlocated on the chip has been one limitation to the development of lab-on-a-chip\ntechnologies. Recently the development of miniature ethanol\/oxygen biofuel cells\n[Moore et al 2005] has been reported to help address this problem. The cell, as shown\nin Fig 4, contained a micro-moulded carbon ink anode with immobilised alcohol\ndehydrogenase and poly(methylene green) together with an external platinum\ncathode. It was found that current densities of 53 \uf06dA cm-2 could be obtained with this\nsystem. As an alternative approach, the same group have developed a different anode\nusing the same active components immobilised in Nafion membranes [Akers et al\n2005], as commonly used in classical H2\/O2 fuel cells. Normally the acidic properties\nof Nafion are detrimental to biofuel cell performance due to enzyme inactivation,\nhowever, neutralisation of the sulphonic acids with tetrabutyl ammonium groups\nprevents this whilst retaining the high ionic transport characteristic of the polymer.\n13\nSingle enzyme system containing alcohol hydrogenase gave power densities of 1.16\nmW cm-2 with ethanol with the addition of aldehyde hydrogenase increasing this to\n2.04 mW cm-2 with ethanol and 1.55 mW cm-2 when methanol is used as a fuel.\n3.3 Microbial based biofuel cells\nMicrobes offer some major advantage over enzymes in that they can catalyse a more\nthorough oxidation of many biofuels and can be less susceptible to poisoning and loss\nof activity under normal operating conditions making them a popular choice for use in\nbiofuel cells. Several recent reviews on this subject have been published [Shukla et al\n2004] and [Rabaey and Verstraete 2005a].\nOne major drawback, however, is that it can be extremely difficult to utilise the\nelectrons generated by the reaction occurring inside the cell. One possible solution is\nvia the use of mediators, however, the compounds chosen for this purpose must\nsatisfy a number of criteria. Firstly they must be capable of being transported across\nthe cell membranes of the micro-organisms and they must also be non-toxic. The\npotential for exploiting the full gamut of reactions that a micro-organism is capable of\nwas realised by work which utilising glucose and E. Coli. and provided an electrical\nyield close to the theoretical maximum of 48 faradays per mole of sucrose [Bennetto\net al 1985]. Other microbial fuel cells had volumes of up to 200 cm3 and were found\nto be capable of generating currents of up to 2 A [Bennetto 1987].\nAs an alternative to the earlier systems which had the micro-organisms freely\nsuspended in the anodic solution, microbial cells of Proteus Vulgaris, have been\nimmobilised onto graphite felt electrodes and have been used to generate currents\nfrom carbohydrates [Allen and Bennetto 1993]. This immobilisation lead to faster\nresponses to substrate addition, whilst the use of a constant feed system gave\nimproved efficiencies when compared to single large additions of fuel. There are also\nmore recent reports of Proteus Vulgaris being used in suspension within a thionine\nmediator solution, to generate power from a variety of carbon sources [Kim et al\n2000]. Galactose was found to be the optimal fuel giving a columbic efficiency of\n63%. Use of a mixed bacterial culture originating from an anaerobic sludge and a\nhexacyanoferrate mediator, further improved this figure to 89% when using a glucose\nfuel and allowed power outputs of up to 360 \uf06dW cm-2 [Rabeay et al 2003].\n14\nInstead of immobilising the microbe, other work studied the effect of immobilising\nthe mediator (in this case Neutral Red) onto a graphite anode [Park et al 2000]. When\nacetate was used as the fuel together with E. Coli as the micro-organism, it was found\nthat immobilising Neutral Red on the anode more than doubled the performance of the\nfuel cell. Immobilised Neutral Red and Mn4+ graphite anodes were used in\nconjunction with a Fe3+ immobilised cathode [Park and Zeikus 2003] and utilised in a\nmicrobial fuel cell. These workers found that when E. Coli or sewage sludge were\nexploited as biocatalysts, currents 1000 times greater than those using unmodified\ngraphite electrodes could be obtained. Sewage sludge was found to be the superior\ncatalyst, producing 14 mA at 0.45 V, corresponding to a power density of 78.8 \uf06dW\ncm-2, nearly an order of magnitude higher than for E. Coli.\nIn a further report a H2\/O2 fuel cell was constructed using carbon felt anodes and\ncathodes together with a combined microbe\/enzyme catalysis system. Bilirubin\noxidase was utilised in the cathode compartment with Desulfovibrio vulgaris being\nintroduced to the anode compartment along with suitable mediators. Under these\nconditions, currents of 0.9 mA at an operating potential of 1 V could be obtained\n[Tsujimura et al 2001a] at physiological pH.\nMediator-free microbial biofuelcells containing an Fe3+ reducing bacterium [Gil et al\n2003] utilising wastewater from a starch processing plant have been constructed and\nrun continuously for periods of up to 3 years. Effects of pH and electrolyte have been\nstudied. Cells of this type have been shown to have potential uses as biological\noxygen demand sensors as well as offering an approach for processing waste water.\nOther work using R. ferrireducens demonstrated that this micro-organism could be\nused to generate energy from glucose [Chauduri and Lovley 2003], and in this context\nit should be noted that the glucose is completely converted to carbon dioxide, a\nprocess capable of releasing 24 electrons with the efficiency of electron transfer to the\nanode being reported to be up to 83% - even in the absence of a mediator. Evidence is\npresented within the paper that it is the microbes adsorbed as a biofilm on the anode\nsurface that produce the current rather than those in suspension in the solution. A\nvariety of graphite electrodes were used, with graphite felt and graphite foam being\n15\nfound to produce up to three times as much power than graphite rods, probably due to\na more porous structure within the materials. Fructose, sucrose and xylose were also\nshown to be suitable fuels.\nAs shown earlier in this review, osmium containing polymers are especially suitable\nfor \u201cwiring\u201d electrodes to electrode surfaces. An osmium containing polymer has also\nbeen utilised to \u201cwire\u201d Gluconobacter Oxydans cells directly to the anode of a biofuel\ncell [Vosteir et al 2004] by simple casting and drying of first the polymer followed by\na suspension of the micro-organism onto cysteamine modified gold electrodes. The\nresulting electrodes were found to be capable of generating power from glucose,\nethanol and glycerol. An electrodeposited conducing polymer was also utilised in this\nmanner, for example by modifying platinum electrodes with a layer of\npoly(tetrafluoroaniline) and then placing these in a medium containing Clostidium\nbacteria [Niessen et al 2004]. It was found that current densities of 1.0-1.3 mA cm-2\ncould be generated from fuel cells such as these when fuels such as glucose, molasses\nor starch were used. These workers showed that the presence of the conductive\npolymer layer also helps to protect against poisoning of the platinum electrode.\nSeveral of the papers previously mentioned utilise a mixed microbial community\nrather than a single micro-organism. Attempts have been made to determine whether\nunder the conditions present in a microbial fuel cell, the community will \u201cevolve\u201d to\nmake the most of the conditions and thereby increase the power output of cells.\nFollowing the reasoning, a microbial fuel cell was set up with graphite electrodes,\nwith glucose being used as the fuel together with sludge obtained from a potato\nprocessing company as the biocatalyst [Rabaey et al 2004]. After the fuel cell had\nbeen operated for two weeks, harvesting the bacteria from the anode compartment of\na fuel cell was performed by simply scraping the biofilm formed off the anode. This\nwas then resuspended within fresh nutrient broth and replacing in the anode\ncompartment. Repeating this process increased the power densities from 60 \uf06dW cm-2\nup to 431 \uf06dW cm-2, corresponding to an efficiency of 81%. Analysis of the system\nindicated predominance of certain types of bacteria and also demonstrates that some\nof them were excreting redox components which acted as mediators. Further studies\non bacteria that produce redox mediators [Rabaey et al 2005b] were performed using\n16\na strain of Pseudomonus acruginosa which produces phenazine derivatives. When the\nperformance within glucose fuelled microbial fuel cells of mutant species that do not\nproduce phenazines were compared with the wild type micro-organism, they were\nfound to produce only 5% of the power output of the wild type. In mixed microbial\nsystems the presence of the mediators produced by Pseudomonus acruginosa were\nalso found to enhance electron transfer rates from other bacterial species. Microbial\nfuel cells operated in continuous mode have also been investigated. Various designs\nof fuel cells have been studied, with the best results being obtained where the anode\ncompartment comprised a packed bed reactor containing graphite granules [Rabaey et\nal 2005c] with the power output being found to be lower under continuous mode\noperation rather than under batch mode operation. Cyclic voltammetry indicated the\npresence of redox mediators of bacterial origin, however, addition of synthetic\nmediators of similar redox potential were found to only have a minimal effect on the\nperformance of the cell.\nOptimisation of microbial fuel cells is important if we are to extract the maximum\nperformance from these systems. Work has been carried out which indicates that the\npower output from cells can be affected by a number of different factors [Min et al\n2005]. One factor that lowers efficiency is diffusion of oxygen into the anode\nchamber and this can lower coulombic efficiency from 55% (chamber purged with\nnitrogen) down to 19% (no purge). Replacing the separator membrane with a salt\nbridge was also found to have a detrimental effect, probably due to an increase in\ninternal resistance of the cell. However replacing the pure culture used in this cell\n(Geobacter metallireducens) with a mixed culture was found to have only a minimal\neffect. Other work has lead to the development of single chamber microbial fuel cells\nwith and without a Nafion separator membrane [Liu and Logan 2004]. The power\noutputs of these cells when fuelled with glucose actually increased from 26.2 \uf06dW\ncm-2 to 49.4 \uf06dW cm-2 upon removal of the separator, although the coulombic\nefficiency dropped from 55% at best to 12%. Power densities of 14.6 \uf06dW cm-2 could\nbe obtained using a domestic wastewater as the fuel source [Liu and Logan 2004].\nAttempts were made to improve the performance of microbial fuel cells produced by\nthis group by, for example, replacing the simple carbon paper anode with an iron\noxide coated anode. This approach was found to double the Coulombic efficiency\n17\nwith an associated near quadrupling of the power density of the cell [Kim et al 2005].\nThe same group also used cysteine as a chemical oxygen scavenger in the anode\ncompartment with an anaerobic marine sediment providing the source of the\nbiocatalyst [Logan et al 2005a]. This work showed that cysteine itself was suitable as\na fuel for the cell, with concentrations of 0.77 g\/L giving power outputs of up to 3.9\n\uf06dW cm-2.\nA novel tubular microbial fuel cell has recently been developed [Rabaey et al 2005d]\nin which a granular graphite anode is contained within a \u201csleeve\u201d made from a\ncommercial cation exchange membrane (Fig. 5). Microorganisms from an operating\nmicrobial cell were used to inoculate the cell and when combined with a sacrificial\nferrocyanide cathode, the resultant cell was found to be capable of operating using\nfuels such as acetate with a coulombic efficiency of 75% or glucose with a coulombic\nefficiency of 59%. The fuel cell could also utilise either digester effluent or domestic\nwastewater as a fuel source. When wastewater was used, up to 22% of the organic\nmaterials were removed with a coulombic efficiency of 96%, leading to a power\noutput of 48 W m-3 anodic compartment volume [Rabaey et al 2005d].\nMost of these systems utilise a simple oxygen cathode, however, microbial fuel cells\nutilising micro-organisms in both the anode and cathode compartments have been\nformulated [Rhoads et al 2005]. In the anode compartment, suspended Klebsiella\npneumonia is exploited to oxidise glucose, with a porous graphite electrode being\nused in conjunction with a soluble quinone mediator. The cathode used was porous\ngraphite in a suspension of Leptothrix discophora. The suspension contains\nmanganese which is oxidised to MnO2 by the bacterium in the presence of oxygen.\nThe resultant biomineralised MnO2 is then reduced at the cathode surface without the\nnecessity for a mediator. It was found in this case that power densities of 12.7 \uf06dW\ncm-2 could be obtained from these cells.\nAlthough carbohydrates based fuels, alcohols or hydrogen are usually the main fuels\nof interest, other potential systems have been considered. As previously mentioned\ncysteine has been utilised as a fuel [Logan et al 2005a]. Other fuel sources include\nacetate which has been utilised in a microbial fuel cell [Bond and Lovley 2003] in\n18\nwhich Geobacter Sulfurreducens was immobilised on a graphite anode and converted\nacetate to carbon dioxide with a 95% electron transfer efficiency being achieved\nwithout recourse to a mediator. Other work by the same group also showed that\naromatic compounds such as benzoate and toluene could be utilised [Bond et al\n2002], with a marine sediment providing the biocatalyst. In a more recent paper\n[Ieropoulos et al 2005] describes a microbial fuel cell with sewage sludge providing\nthe biocatalyst, with a report that the power output of the cell when fuelled by glucose\ncould be increased by a factor of five times by the simple addition of sulphate. In the\npaper recently published within the special edition of Biosensor and Bioelectronics\n[Lowy et al 2006], showed that redox potential across the interface between the\norganic rich reducing environment of marine sediments and relatively oxygen rich\nseawater can produce electrical energy. Organic compounds within the sediment are\noxidised by sediment microbial life without the need for a mediator, therefore when a\ngraphite anode is embedded in the sediment and a graphite cathode suspended in\nseawater, current flows in the order of 30 mW m-2 (90 mA m-2) are observed although\nmodification of the anode with quinones or metals could increase the current density\nby up to five times.\n4. Photochemical biofuel cells\nAs an alternative to inorganic semiconductor-based or dye-based photoelectric cells,\nattempts have been made to use biological species to capture light and convert this\ninto electrical energy. Some of these systems use microbes which respire thereby\nusing a respiratory fuel and so fall within the scope of this review. For example a\nmicrobial cell has been reported utilising a soluble quinine mediator in which the\nanode compartment contains a carbon electrode and a suspension of Anabaena\nvariabilis immobilised onto alginate beads [Yagashita et al 1998]. The cathode\ncompartment contained potassium ferricyanide and a carbon electrode. When\nilluminated for a 10 hours light\/10 hours dark cycle, an electrical current was\ngenerated (1 mA under a 500 ohms load) with low photon to electron conversion\nefficiency (0.2 %). A much more efficient system utilised Synechococcus in which a\ncurrent output was obtained from photolysis of water under illumination as well as\nfrom consumption of carbohydrates in the dark [Yagishita et al 1997]. Up to 3.3% of\nthe light energy could be harvested as electrical energy.\n19\nEach of the cells mentioned above required the use of a sacrificial ferricyanide\ncathode and therefore may be thought not to be true fuel cells. A cell containing\nbiological moieties in both the anode (cyanobacteria) and cathode (bilirubin oxidase)\ncompartments has also been reported [Tsujimura et al 2001b]. The cyanobacteria\ncatalyse the photooxidation of water with the production of electrons which are\npassed to the carbon felt anode and are thereby made available for the reduction of\noxygen at the cathode. Power outputs upon illumination of 30-40 \uf06dW cm-2 could be\nobtained with light energy conversion efficiencies of 2-2.5% being reported.\nThe combination of photochemical and biological reactions has also been of recent\ninterest. A cell containing an indium tin oxide anode coated with a porphyrin\nsensitizer has been reported [de la Garza et al 2003]. Photooxidation of the sensitizer\noccurs at this electrode and causes conversion of NAD(P)H to NAD(P)+. Normally\nthis reaction would cease when all the NAD(P)H has been converted, however, when\nglucose and glucose dehydrogenase are present within the anode compartment,\nconsumption of glucose and regeneration of NAD(P)H occurs. When combined with a\nPt\/O2 cathode, photocurrents could be obtained with a power output of 9.5 \uf06dW cm-2 at\nan operating potential of 0.45 V, with a photon to electron conversion efficiency of\n12% being obtained. Other enzymes were utilised within this type of system to enable\nthe use of other fuels such as methanol and ethanol [de la Garza et al 2003]. A similar\nsystem utilising nanoparticulate titanium oxide as the anode material has also been\ndeveloped [Brune et al 2004] and showed improved performance with a power output\nof 37 \uf06dW cm-2 at an operating potential of 0.84 V and with a similar photon to\nelectron conversion efficiency being reported.\n20\n5. Uses of biofuel cells\nThere are several potential uses of biofuel cells, with the ones receiving most interest\nbeing described below.\n5.1 Transport and energy generation\nAt present the world\u2019s largest source of power is derived from the use of fossil fuels\nand especially petroleum. However the burning of hydrocarbons cannot continue\nindefinitely because of environmental problems and also the simple fact that we have\na finite supply of these fuels. The utilisation of biofuel cells with carbohydrates as a\npower source would, if they could be developed, help to mitigate at least some of\nthese problems. It has been calculated [Shukla et al 1999] that a litre of a concentrated\ncarbohydrate solution could power a car for 25-30 km. It follows that if a car were to\nbe fitted with a 50 L tank, the car could travel over 1000 km without refuelling. Not\nonly would this offer environmentally benefits, it would also remove the risk\nassociated with transport of large amounts of volatile, flammable fuels in addition to\nthe risk of fire following a road traffic accident.\n5.2 Implantable power sources.\nSince biofuel cells can potentially be run in living systems, taking the oxygen and fuel\nrequired for their operation can conceivably be taken from their immediate\nenvironment, and this offers great potential as power sources within a range of\npossible implantable medical devices. For example, a biosensor for glucose has been\ndeveloped utilising a glucose oxidase based anode and cytochrome c cathode to\ngenerate electrical current [Katz et al 2001]. This process can be used in a biosensor\nformat to give a measurement of the glucose concentration in the range of 1-80 mM.\nA similar sensor for lactate has also been developed [Katz et al 2001]. Other potential\nuses for miniature fuel cells include power sources for drug delivery systems with\nbiofuel cells being small enough for this purpose already having been developed\n[Mano et al 2003b, Moore et al 2005].\n5.3 Waste water treatment.\nNumerous fuel cells have been shown to generate power by oxidation of compounds\nfound in waste water streams [e.g. Gil et al 2003, Rabaey et al 2004, Liu and Logan\n2004]. Two useful purposes can be realised by this procedure; (a) for the removal of\n21\nthe organic compounds from the waste stream and (b) for the generation of electrical\npower. A recent review on the subject [Logan 2005] calculates that the wastewater\nfrom a town of 150,000 people could potentially be used to generate up to 2.3 MW of\npower (assuming a 100% efficiency), although a power of 0.5 MW might be more\nrealistic. It should be mentioned in this context that up to 80% of the chemical oxygen\ndemand of wastewater can be removed by treatment in a microbial fuel cell and it is\npossible that the electricity generated in this manner could be used on site to power\nfurther treatment of the wastewater. An economic study within the review [Logan\n2005] shows the potential for this application, although this is highly dependent on\nlocal power costs.\n5.4 Robots\nThe concept of robots which can \u201clive off the land\u201d by utilising biofuel cells to\ngenerate their power and the various challenges to be overcome has been already\ndiscussed [Wilkinson 2000]. An early example is the \u201cSlugbot\u201d (Fig. 6), which as its\nname implies hunts slugs [Kelly 2003]. The \u201cSlugbot\u201d itself is powered by a\nrechargeable battery, however, once captured the slugs are held in a holding tank until\nthe battery begins to run down. The \u201cSlugbot\u201d then returns to a microbial fuel cell to\nwhich it transfers the slugs and utilises the energy produced by their \u201cdigestion\u201d to\nrecharge its battery (www-robotics.usc.edu). Another \u201cgastropod\u201d named\n\u201cChew-Chew\u201d has also been produced and is capable of \u201cfeeding\u201d and so running via\nconsumption of meat (www.gastrobots.com).\n6. Future of biofuel cells\nThe development of biofuel cells for practical applications is a field which is still in\nits infancy, although there is unquestionably much potential for further improvement.\nTable 1 lists some of the great strides that have been made over the last few years in\nimproving the current (and therefore power) densities obtainable at electrodes used\nwithin enzymatic based biofuel cells. Microbial fuel cells (Table 2) offer the promise\nfor use as power supplies with high longevities that are capable of using complex\nbiofuels formed from biological waste. Other possible avenues include exploiting\nenzymes harvested from the lysis of living cells as catalysts, thereby combining the\npower output of enzyme-based biofuel cells with the versatility of microbial based\nbiofuel cells.\n22\nOne of the most active areas in the field is focussed towards developing power\nsources for implantable devices within humans. Biofuel cells offer several possible\nadvantages over existing technologies, such as the use of lithium-iodine batteries in\nimplantable devices such as heart pacemakers. Ideally an implanted biofuel cell would\nuse a biological metabolite fuel source such as glucose or lactate, both of which are\nreadily available in physiological fluids such as blood. The high turnover of a \u201cwired\u201d\nenzyme electrode in such applications could generate power levels capable of meeting\nthe needs of many devices without the need for a mediator. There are a number of\nproblems which need to be addressed, however, the most important of which is that\nmost of the enzyme modified electrodes described in the literature to date have\nlifetimes in the order of weeks whereas for in vivo implanted devices, longevities of\nyears would be required for practical application. Unfortunately most of the biofuel\ncells described today would be capable of meeting demands for biomedical devices\nimplanted for short-term application only. Although the stabilisation of enzymes has\nbeen an active area for many years, the state-of-the-art is not capable of meeting the\nrequirements of such devices [Barton et al 2004]. It is probable that enzymes will\nhave to be modified by routes such as genetic engineering if the required enzyme\nstabilities are to be met. A second problem that must be addressed is that of\nbiocompatibility; the biofuel cell must be capable of existing in the physiological\nenvironment without an unacceptable degree of biofouling occurring over extended\nperiods of time \u2013 which otherwise would lead to fouling of the device or to\nphysiological harm to the patient.\nOther possibilities for biofuel cell research include the future development of power\nsupplies for use in remote areas. In an ideal scenario biofuel cells such as these should\nbe capable of using readily available fuel sources. Plant saps, for example, often\ncontain high levels of sugars which could be used as a fuel. Many conventional\nhydrogen or alcohol fuel cells require expensive noble metal catalysts and moreover\noften require extreme conditions of pH or high temperature. Biological fuel cells\nwhich usually perform optimally at near ambient temperatures and neutral pH -\nclearly would offer benefits in this respect. Microbial fuel cells may also in the future\nbe used to help degrade organic waste such as sewage sludge whilst also producing\nelectricity as a useful by-product.\n23\nAlthough some specialist devices for providing, for example, short lifetime\nimplantable power devices could now be considered feasible, it is obvious that a\ncontinuing research effort needs to be made before we will see large scale use of\nbiofuel cells. Problems of lifetime, stability and power density all need to be\naddressed, although the possible benefits of this technology are likely to drive\ncontinuing research. We need to improve our knowledge of biocatalysis, electron\nprocesses at surfaces, biological and other material stability to realise this vision.\n24\nReferences\nAkers N. L., Moore C.
