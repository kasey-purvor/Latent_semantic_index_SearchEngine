Overall, CVD is\nestimated to cost the UK close to \u00a326 billion per year: 56%\nfrom direct health-care costs, 24% from reduced pro-\nductivity and 16% as a result of informal care2. Advancing\nage is the principal non-modifiable risk factor for this\ndisease3 and, given that the UK population is ageing4,\nresearch efforts must focus on primary prevention to\ntackle the growing public health burden. High blood\npressure (BP), smoking and high total cholesterol (TC)\nlevels are the principal modifiable risk factors for CVD\nmortality5, although risk is not limited to these factors.\nA wealth of evidence is available describing the CVD\nrisk attributable to adiposity (estimated, for example,\nusing body mass index (BMI; kg m22)6 or waist-to-hip\nratio (WHR)7); serum TC, low-density lipoprotein\ncholesterol (LDL-C)8 and high-density lipoprotein choles-\nterol (HDL-C)9; serum triacylglycerols (TAG)10; and dietary\nfats11,12. Less is known about the potential role of dietary\ncarbohydrate13.\nThe glycaemic index (GI) ranks carbohydrate-contain-\ning foods based on the increase in blood glucose\nfollowing their consumption relative to that following\nconsumption of an equi-carbohydrate portion of a\nreference food (white bread or glucose)14. This index is\ntherefore more informative than measuring the quantity of\ncarbohydrate consumed alone. The exaggerated glucose\nand insulin responses that occur when consuming a high-\nGI diet could increase the risk of CVD via a number of\nmechanisms. These include oxidative stress as a result of\nq The Authors 2007*Corresponding author: Email G.Frost@surrey.ac.uk\nPublic Health Nutrition: 10(11), 1321\u20131335 doi: 10.1017\/S1368980007702914\npostprandial hyperglycaemia and independent effects of\nhyperinsulinaemia on lipid profile, blood pressure,\ncoagulation factors, inflammatory mediators and endo-\nthelial function15.\nTable 116\u201329 summarises previous research investigating\nthe relationship between GI and CVD risk factors. Two\npublications have reviewed the efficacy of low-GI diets for\nweight loss; however their conclusions differ, highlighting\nthe controversy surrounding low-GI diets. Raben18\nconcluded that there was no evidence to support the use\nof low-GI diets for long-term weight control. Of the 20\nlonger-term studies reviewed (duration ranging from 6\ndays to 6 months) mean weight loss was 1.5 kg on the low-\nGI diets compared with 1.6 kg (not significant, NS) on the\nhigh-GI diets. When including only the nine studies that\nwere well-controlled for energy, macronutrient and fibre\nintake, the mean weight loss was greater on the low-GI\ndiets (23.0 ^ 1.8 vs. 22.8 ^ 1.1 kg, NS). This latter\nfinding echoes those reported by Brand-Miller et al.9.\nFour medium-term (duration range 5\u201318 weeks) human\nintervention studies were examined, with two demonstrat-\ning greater weight or fat loss on low- vs. high-GI diets and\ntwo showing no significant difference. Findings from\nanimal models that support a beneficial role of low-GI\ndiets for weight loss were also included. For example, rats\nfed a diet based on high-GI starch, but otherwise matched\nfor energy and macronutrient intakes, had increased\nvisceral fat stores and reduced rates of lipolysis30. Brand-\nMiller et al.19 suggested that animal studies provide\nmechanistic evidence and contradict the assumption that\nall calories are equal in terms of effect on weight gain.\nSuggestive evidence is available from well-controlled,\nsufficiently powered studies to suggest that decreased\ndietary GI is associated with a reduced risk from CVD;\nhowever, as reasoned in both review articles, longer-term\nrandomised controlled trials (RCTs) are necessary to\nelucidate this relationship in different population groups\nand to investigate the effects of conventional energy-\nrestricted vs. ad libitum low-GI diets on weight loss for\nexample.\nA 10% reduction in LDL-C (P , 0.05)21, elevations in\nHDL-C (0.08\u20130.25 mmol l21 greater in the lowest quintile,\nP , 0.05)23,26 and reductions in TAG (237.2 vs. 219.1%,\nP \u00bc 0.005)22 have been observed with low- vs. high-GI\ndiets. Two meta-analyses (of 15 and 16 RCTs, respectively)\nexamining the effects of low-GI diets on blood lipid levels\nfound evidence for a beneficial effect of low-GI diets on\nTC and limited evidence for a reduction in LDL-C in\nsubjects with type 2 diabetes. No benefit was observed for\neither HDL-C or TAG16,17. However, many of the studies\nreviewed were methodologically flawed, under-powered\nor of short duration.\nNo standard definitions exist to quantify \u2018low\u2019- and\n\u2018high\u2019-GI diets, although a difference of at least 10\u201315\nunits is observed in most publications17. Between-study\ndifferences in these definitions may contribute to the\ninconsistent results of clinical trials to date. Many low-GI\nfoods (e.g. granary bread, pasta, beans and pulses) are\nhigh in fibre and inadequate control for differences in fibre\nintake \u2013 a potentially cardioprotective factor31,32 \u2013 may\nconfound studies of dietary GI and cardiovascular\nhealth33. The glycaemic load (GL), calculated as total\namount of daily carbohydrate (g) \u00a3 GI, is a measure of the\noverall postprandial glycaemic effect of a food or meal.\nHigh-GL diets have also been associated with an increased\nrisk of coronary heart disease (CHD)24 and detrimental\neffects on CVD risk factors29. In the current study the effect\nof GI alone is examined. Relationships between other\ncarbohydrate-related dietary variables (fibre, GL, carbo-\nhydrate intake) and CVD risk factors are currently being\nanalysed for this cohort and will be the subject of future\npublications.\nEvidence for an association between dietary GI and\nCVD risk in free-living settings is conflicting, and data are\nparticularly limited in elderly populations. Here, data from\nthe National Diet and Nutrition Survey of adults aged 65\nyears and over (referred to hereafter as NDNS) are\nexamined to determine if low dietary GI is associated with\nlower body weight, BMI, WHR, BP and a more favourable\nserum cholesterol profile.\nSubjects and design\nThe NDNS34 is a comprehensive, cross-sectional survey\nwhich collected data on dietary habits and nutritional\nstatus. All individuals who agreed to participate completed\na descriptive interview detailing general eating habits,\nmedications, socio-economic and health status before they\nwere invited to take part in further data collection. All\nsubsequent interviews (e.g. 4-day weighed intake record,\nblood and urine collections) were optional. Only data\ncollected from free-living, non-institutionalised partici-\npants are considered here; no subjects were following a\nweight-loss diet at the time of the survey.\nNDNS methods are reported in detail elsewhere34.\nBriefly, anthropometric measurements were carried out at\nthe participant\u2019s home, with their shoes removed, wearing\nlight clothing. Height was measured to the nearest 1 mm\nusing a portable, digital telescopic stadiometer; weight to\nthe nearest 100 g using Soehnle Quantratronic digital\nscales. BMI was calculated as weight (kg) divided by the\nsquare of height (m2)35. Duplicate waist and hip\nmeasurements were made using an insertion tape, and\nWHR was calculated from the mean of two readings. Three\nsupine BP measurements were taken from the right arm at\nintervals of 1 min using an automated sphygmoman-\nometer (DINAMAP; GE Health Systems). Blood samples\nwere collected after an overnight fast and analysed for TC,\nHDL-C, LDL-C and TAG concentrations34.\nParticipants were issued with Soehnle Quanta digital\nfood scales and two 4-day dietary record sheets: one for use\nat home and a simplified form for use outside home.\nJE Milton et al.1322\nTable 1 Summary of previous research investigating the relationship between GI and CVD risk factors\nStudy category Study type\nAuthor\nand date\nNumber of\nsubjects\nSubject\ncharacteristics\nOutcome\nmeasure(s)\nIntervention\nperiod\nDifference in GI,\nmean (SD)\nor range Results Significance\nIntervention Meta-analysis Opperman\net al.

Where no\npublished data were available, published analogues\nwere used (for example, the mean GI value for\n\u2018oranges\u2019 was imputed for \u2018clementines\u2019) or GI values\nwere calculated from recipes using the mixed-meal\nformula41:\nTo calculate the average GI of each diet, the following\nformula was applied42:\nGIdiet \u00bc\nfood\nXGIfood\u00a3Quantityof carbohydrateinthefood \u00f0g\u00de\nTotalquantityof carbohydrateinthediet\u00f0g\u00de :\nMany of the foods for which GI values were estimated\ncontributed only a small proportion of the total\ncarbohydrate consumed by each individual. To assess\nthe relative importance of GI values obtained from various\nsources, the mean percentage of an individual\u2019s total\ncarbohydrate intake attributable to each source of GI data\n(international tables, other published data, estimations\nand calculations) was calculated.\nValidation of dietary intake\nBasal metabolic rate (BMR), calculated using standard\nregression equations based on age, sex and weight\n(Schofield equations)43, was compared with energy intake\nto identify underreporting. A habitual energy intake estimate\nless than 1.2 \u00a3 BMR, considered incompatible with energy\nbalance44, was used here to define low energy reporters\n(LERs). In the feasibility study, a 24-hour urine sample was\ntaken and p-aminobenzoic acid tablets were given to\nparticipants to check the completeness of the sample.\nProtein intakes were validated by comparing urinary and\ndietary nitrogen (N) concentration: ratios of urinary N\/\ndietary N were 0.92 for males and 0.87 for females, close to\nthe permitted range for validity (0.70\u20130.90)36.\nStatistical analysis\nTo control for the potentially confounding effect of energy\nintake, all nutrient data are presented as energy-adjusted\nvariables. HDL-C, TC\/HDL-C ratio, TAG and Englyst fibre\nintake were log-transformed to normalise the distributions.\nThe ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acid intake\n(P\/S) was calculated and used in subsequent analyses to\nimprove the stability of the regression model. Differences in\nmeans between LERs and non-LERs and between males and\nfemaleswere compared with unpaired t-tests for continuous\nvariables and by x2 tests for categorical variables.\nTo inform regression analyses and identify potential\ncollinearity, a Spearman correlation matrix, controlled for\nenergy intake (males and females separately and\ncombined), was constructed for nutrient and physical\nactivity level (PAL) data.\nAssociations of GI with CVD risk factors (weight,\nn \u00bc 993; BMI, n \u00bc 983; WHR, n \u00bc 993; BP, n \u00bc 960;\nlipoprotein sub-fractions, n \u00bc 784; TAG, n \u00bc 1100) were\nanalysed using multiple linear regression. The basic model\nfor all dependent variables was adjusted for age, region\nand social class (non-manual or manual, classified by main\noccupation prior to retirement). Analyses were carried out\nseparately for males and females and combined (with\nadjustment for sex in combined analysis).\nEvidence-based confounding factors were added\nsequentially in additional models for each dependent\nvariable (e.g. BMI when BP was the dependent)45. In\nsubsequent models, reported potential confounders were\nalso added (e.g. P\/S ratio when BP was the dependent)46.\nTo determine if the amount of fibre consumed affected the\nrelationship of dietary GI to the dependent variables, an\ninteraction term (GI \u00a3 Englyst fibre) was included in\nadditional regression models.\nAll analyses were performed with SPSS (version 12.0;\nSPSS Inc.). Analyses were carried out on the full sample\nand repeated with the exclusion of LERs. P-values\n,0.05 (two-tailed) were considered statistically\nsignificant.\nGIfood \u00bc\ningredient\nXGIingredient \u00a3Quantity of carbohydrate in the ingredient \u00f0g\u00de\nTotal quantity of carbohydrate in the food \u00f0g\u00de :\nJE Milton et al.1326\nResults\nStudy population\nOf the free-living sample (n \u00bc 2172 individuals), 75%\n(n \u00bc 1632) provided a full or partial interview (responding\nsample) and 78% (n \u00bc 1275) of the responding sample\nalso provided a 4-day weighed dietary intake record. Data\ncollected from those who reported being unwell during\nthe dietary recording period, with appetite\/eating patterns\naffected (8% males, n \u00bc 50; 11% females, n \u00bc 73), were\nexcluded. This resulted in a maximum study population of\n1152 individuals (53% of the initial sample), of which\n50.5% were male (age 75.9 ^ 7.0 years, BMI\n26.3 ^ 3.6 kg m22; mean ^ standard deviation, SD) and\n49.5% were female (age 77.6 ^ 8.0 years, BMI\n26.6 ^ 4.8 kg m22; mean ^ SD). Selected demographic,\nlifestyle, anthropometric, biochemical and nutrient charac-\nteristics are presented by sex in Table 2. Some 49.2%\n(n \u00bc 478) of individuals (39.7% males, 59.4% females;\nP , 0.001) were defined as LERs. The exclusion of these\nparticipants did not materially affect the outcomes, and\nthus only the analyses performed on the full dataset are\npresented.\nSource of GI values\nGI values were assigned to 2323 individual food codes,\ncontributing 73% of the total weight of carbohydrate\nconsumed by participants. Of these, 235 (10%) were\nassigned a mean value from multiple entries in the\ninternational tables, and 358 (15%) were obtained from a\nsingle entry in the international tables38. Values for 1580\n(68%) codes were estimated from analogous foods with\npublished GI values, while 96 (4%) were calculated by the\nmixed-meal method42. The 54 remaining GI values were\nsourced from other published data39,40. On average, GI\nvalues assigned from a mean value from the international\ntables contributed 43.5 ^ 14.2% (mean ^ SD) of an\nindividual\u2019s total carbohydrate intake; values obtained\nfrom a single entry 24.7 ^ 13.0%; analogues 26.3 ^ 11.7%;\nand mixed-meal calculated GI values 1.8 ^ 3.3%. The\nremaining GI values, obtained from other published\nsources39,40, contributed on average 3.5 ^ 3.4% of total\ncarbohydrate intake.\nCorrelation analyses\nCorrelation matrices for males and females are presented\nin Tables 3 and 4, respectively. Dietary GI did not correlate\nsignificantly with weight, BMI, WHR, BP or any lipoprotein\nfraction in either sex. Dietary GI was inversely associated\nwith Englyst fibre intakes in males and females (r \u00bc 20.34\nand r \u00bc 20.32, respectively).\nRegression analyses\nAssociations of dietary GI with weight, BMI, WHR and\nother CVD risk factors, with and without control for\npotential confounders, are reported for males and females\nin Tables 5 and 6, respectively.\nIn males, prior to controlling for potential confounders,\ndietary GI was directly associated with 10g TAG\nconcentration (b \u00bc 0.008 ^ 0.003). There was also a\ndirect relationship between GI and diastolic BP\n(b \u00bc 0.325 ^ 0.164). However, after adjusting for age,\nsocial class and region (Model 2), neither association was\nstatistically significant. In females, dietary GI was not\nsignificantly associated with any of the anthropometric\nvariables or CVD risk factors assessed, either before or\nafter adjustment for confounders.\nWhen the analyses were repeated in males and females\ncombined (data not shown), WHR was significantly\npredicted by dietary GI (b \u00bc 0.003 ^ 0.001; P , 0.001)\nin Model 1. However, after controlling for sex, age, social\nclass and region, the relationship was no longer\nsignificant. Subsequent models further reduced the\nstrength of the relationship. Dietary GI predicted (log)\nTAG concentration (b \u00bc 0.005 ^ 0.002; P \u00bc 0.017); the\nassociation remained significant after control for sex, age,\nsocial class and region (Model 2), and PAL and BMI (Model\n3) (b \u00bc 0.004 ^ 0.002; P \u00bc 0.049). Adjusting for alcohol\n(units week21) (Model 4), carbohydrate (g day21) (Model\n5) and Englyst fibre (g day21) (Model 6) weakened the\nassociation (b \u00bc 0.02 ^ 0.02; P \u00bc 0.362), which became\nnon-significant.\nWhen the interactions between fibre and GI were\nconsidered, it was apparent that in females the non-\nsignificant relationships between dietary GI and weight\nand between dietary GI and BMI were dependent on fibre\nintake. The addition of a GI \u00a3 fibre interaction term to the\nregression model revealed significant inverse associations\nbetween GI and weight (b \u00bc 20.995 ^ 0.360; P \u00bc 0.008)\nand GI and BMI (b \u00bc 20.302 ^ 0.145; P \u00bc 0.038).\nSignificant and borderline-significant interactions were\ndetected between fibre and GI in males for HDL-C,\nTC\/HDL-C ratio and TAG, indicating that the observed\nrelationships (non-significant) of dietary GI and these\noutcome measures are also dependent on fibre intake.\nDiscussion\nCarbohydrate is absorbed rapidly from high-GI (relative to\nlow-GI) foods, causing higher postprandial glucose and\ninsulin responses47. This encourages carbohydrate rather\nthan fat oxidation, stimulates lipolysis and increases\nvisceral non-esterified fatty acid release in the late\npostprandial period, promoting body fat gain. Low-GI\ncarbohydrates have been associated with greater satiety\nand hence reductions in subsequent energy intake48.\nThus, we hypothesised that low-GI diets would be\nassociated with lower body weight, BMI, WHR, BP and a\nmore favourable cholesterol profile in a free-living\npopulation. Our study found a high-GI diet to be\nassociated with higher TAG concentrations and higher\nGlycaemic index and cardiovascular risk factors 1327\nTable 2 Demographic, lifestyle, anthropometric, biochemical and dietary intake data by sex for all participants (all significant differences\nare highlighted)\nMales Females\nDemographics\nRegion\nScotland and Northern 34.4 34.9\nCentral and South West 42.1 37.5\nLondon and South East 23.5 27.5\nSocial class\nNon-manual 45.1 46.6\nManual 54.9 53.4\nAge (years) 75.9 ^ 7.0* 77.6 ^ 8.0\nLifestyle\nSmoking status\nNon (never & ex) 82.9 87.5\n, 20 cigarettes day21 11.0 10.2\n$ 20 cigarettes day21 6.0 2.3\nSelf-reported alcohol intake level\nNon-drinker 7.2 25.3\nEx-drinker 10.8 8.2\nVery low 11.5 20.5\nLow 35.5 31.1\nModerate 16.2 6.8\nFairly high 8.3 4.0\nHigh 4.5 0.9\nVery high 2.6 0.4\nDrinker, units unknown 3.4 2.8\nEstimated alcohol intake (units week21) 10.5 ^ 15.0** 3.0 ^ 5.0\nMaximum physical activity level\nVigorous (e.g. running or jogging) 0.5 0.4\nModerate (e.g. cycling, keep fit, swimming, $20 min brisk walking) 79.7 85.4\nLight (e.g. dancing, golf, yoga, $20 min slow walking) 18.4 13.5\nInactive 1.4 0.7\nBMR 1521.5 ^ 157.1** 1263.6 ^ 121.4\nEI\/BMR ratio 1.26 ^ 0.30** 1.13 ^ 0.27\nAnthropometry\nHeight (cm) 169.0 ^ 6.9** 155.4 ^ 6.7\nWeight (kg) 75.1 ^ 12.0** 64.1 ^ 12.4\nBMI (kg m22) 26.3 ^ 3.6 26.6 ^ 4.8\nWHR 0.93 ^ 0.06** 0.84 ^ 0.07\nBlood pressure\nSystolic (mmHg) 150.1 ^ 21.9* 154.5 ^ 23.8\nDiastolic (mmHg) 79.7 ^ 12.7* 76.7 ^ 13.5\nBiochemical\nTC (mmol l21) 5.5 ^ 1.1** 6.3 ^ 1.5\nTAG (mmol l21) 1.6 ^ 0.9 1.6 ^ 0.8\nHDL-C (mmol l21) 1.2 ^ 0.5** 1.4 ^ 0.5\nLDL-C (mmol l21) 4.3 ^ 1.2** 4.9 ^ 1.5\nDietary intake\nEnergy intake (kcal) 1891.2 ^ 454.8** 1415.3 ^ 338.0\nCHO (% of food energy) 49.1 ^ 7.0 49.4 ^ 6.3\nStarch (% of food energy) 27.2 ^ 5.8 27.3 ^ 5.3\nSugar (% of food energy) 22.0 ^ 7.1 22.0 ^ 6.8\nEnglyst fibre (g per 1000 kcal) 7.1 ^ 2.8** 7.7 ^ 3.1\nProtein (% of food energy) 15.1 ^ 3.0** 15.9 ^ 3.6\nFat (% of food energy) 35.0 ^ 5.7** 36.7 ^ 6.2\nSFA (% of food energy) 14.5 ^ 3.6** 15.8 ^ 4.1\nMUFA (% of food energy) 10.8 ^ 2.0 11.0 ^ 2.1\nn\u20133 PUFA (% of food energy) 0.77 ^ 0.36* 0.82 ^ 0.36\nn\u20136 PUFA (% of food energy) 4.8 ^ 2.1 4.8 ^ 2.2\nP\/S ratio 0.42 ^ 0.22 0.40 ^ 0.24\nTFA (% of food energy) 1.5 ^ 0.5** 1.6 ^ 0.5\nGI 59.4 ^ 3.6** 58.2 ^ 3.8\nBMR \u2013 basal metabolic rate;

In the combined analysis of both\nsexes the association with TAG persisted and a direct\nrelationship between GI and WHR was identified. These\nrelationships were attenuated by increasing levels of\nadjustment for potential confounding factors, and became\nstatistically non-significant. No significant relationships\nwere observed for weight, BMI or lipoprotein\nconcentrations.\nPrevious intervention studies investigating the efficacy\nof high- vs. low-GI diets for weight loss report conflicting\nfindings18,19. Liese et al. studied 979 normal (67%) and\n\u2018glucose tolerance impaired\u2019 (33%) adults and found no\nassociation between GI (as assessed by food-frequency\nquestionnaire, FFQ) and BMI or waist circumference28.\nThis lack of association was attributed to the sample size\nand the exclusion of people with pre-existing CVD or\ndiabetes, thus resulting in a cohort less susceptible to\nenvironmental exposure13. In contrast, Ma et al. found a\ndirect association between GI (7-day dietary recall) and\nBMI in a longitudinal study of 572 healthy adults27. Other\nstudies have found significant, direct relationships\nbetween GI and weight, yet these tend to include obese\nindividuals or younger adults49,50. Fat mass increases and\nlean mass decreases with age, independent of body\nweight change. This change comprises increases in\nvisceral adipose tissue, intramyocellular and intramuscular\nlipid and liver fat, and decreases in lean soft tissue and in\nfat-free mass51. These changes may render an elderly\npopulation less responsive to dietary changes and\ncomparisons of studies with different population ages\ninvalid.\nIngestion of high-GI carbohydrates results in reduced\ninsulin sensitivity, and potentially a reduction in HDL-C\nand reciprocal increase in TAG concentration52. Low-GI\ndiets improve insulin sensitivity53, therefore higher HDL-C\nand lower TAG concentrations might be expected in\nindividuals following such diets. Unlike previous popu-\nlation studies23,26, we failed to observe an association\nbetween dietary GI and HDL-C. Our results are consistent\nwith those from the Zutphen Elderly Study25, which\nexamined the association between high-GI diets and\nhyperinsulinaemia, hyperglycaemia, dyslipidaemia and\nCHD risk in 394 males (64\u201384 years). The lack of\nassociation was attributed to the exclusion of males with a\nhistory of diabetes or myocardial infarction13; however, no\nsuch exclusions were applied here. The disparity in age\nmay explain these differences, as TC and LDL-C levels\nhave been shown to increase54, while fractional clearance\nof LDL-C55 and the number of LDL receptors in hepatic\ntissue decline56, with age.\nTheNDNS had a low response rate (,50%), resulting in a\nsample size half that estimated to observe significant\nassociations, and one potentially biased by differences in\ndiet, lifestyle and CVD risk factors between responders and\nnon-responders. A high proportion of LERs (40% males,\n60% females) was identified and insufficient information is\navailable to determine whether under- or misreporting was\nevident, or if reported low intakes were valid. Under-\nreporting may not affect foods or nutrients system-\natically57,58; thus, although energy adjustment controls for\ndifferences in energy intake, percentage intakes from\nmacronutrients may remain inaccurate. Protein intake was\nvalidated in the NDNS feasibility study through compari-\nsons of urinary with dietary nitrogen concentrations;\nhowever, no biomarkers exist for carbohydrate or fibre and\ntherefore validation of GI calculations is not routine.\nOur dietary GI values ranged from 40 to 72 units\n(glucose \u00bc 100), with a normal distribution. In the\nZutphen study25 values ranged from 39 to 65 units, with\na right skewed distribution. Frost et al.23 previously\nassociated low-GI diets with higher HDL-C concentrations\nin healthy middle-aged adults. The total range of GI was\nnot presented, however data were normally distributed\nand quintile means were similar to those of the current\nstudy. The lack of variation in dietary GI is unlikely to be\nresponsible for the lack of association observed here;\ntherefore GI calculation estimates were considered. The\nmajority of values were obtained from international\ntables38, many of which are sourced outside the UK; thus\nestimates for processed foods (e.g. Special K) may be\ninvalid. Between-subject variation (for example, between\ndiabetic and non-diabetic test groups)59, methodological\ndifferences, and differences in preparation, processing,\nvariety and ripeness may also introduce inaccuracies.\nUsing the mean of multiple estimates, we attempted to\nimprove the reliability of GI estimates, but undoubtedly\ninaccuracies remain that could attenuate observed\nassociations60.\nGI values estimated from analogues contributed to\napproximately 26% carbohydrate. Where recipes and\nmixed-meal calculations are used, effects of protein and fat\nfrom non-carbohydrate-containing foods on insulin\nsecretion or gastric emptying are ignored61. One study of\neight healthy subjects demonstrated that variations in the\nenergy (395\u2013610 kcal), fat (8\u201324 g) and protein (12\u201325g)\ncontent of ameal have little effect on thepostprandial insulin\nandglucose response62, the amountof carbohydrate and the\nGI explaining 90% of the observed variation in glucose\nresponse. Flint et al.41 disagree however. Their study of 28\nsubjects consuming 13 test meals found no association\nbetween the estimated GI and that obtained using in vivo GI\nmeasurements. The meals all contained 50g available\ncarbohydrate with varying amounts of fibre (1\u201324g), fat\n(3\u201342 g) and protein (5\u201328g), and hence differing energy\ncontents (270\u2013715kcal)41.\nThe current study is limited by its cross-sectional design.\nWe are trying to detect true associations between dietary\nintake estimated from a 4-day record (which may or may\nnot represent long-term habitual intake) and various CVD\nrisk factors, which may have been influenced by diet for\nmore than 60 years, and which are also subject to other\nenvironmental63 and genetic64 influences. Notably, dietary\nJE Milton et al.1332\nintakes differ between adulthood and old age due to\nchanges in physiology, dentition, and intended weight\ngain or loss. Problems with dentition may cause elderly\nindividuals to eat softer, lower-fibre foods (e.g. white\nbread (GI \u00bc 70) vs. grainy\/seeded bread (GI \u00bc 54)) and\ncould explain why our results do not support those of\nother studies; however, no food group analysis was\ncompleted here.\nThe physiological changes associated with ageing might\nlimit or mask the beneficial effect of low-GI diets on body\nweight or CVD risk factors. The prospective Nurses\u2019 Health\nStudy investigated the effect of GI on CVD risk24 among\n.75 000 US women followed-up for 10 years. The highest\nquintile of GI (assessed by FFQ, relative to the lowest\ncategory) was associated with a relative risk of 1.28\n(P \u00bc 0.02) for total CHD. We have examined risk factors\nfor CVD independently and found no significant beneficial\neffect; however, small additive effects (undetectable in an\nepidemiological study of this size) on individual risk\nfactors might combine to produce a measurable effect on\ndisease incidence in the long term.\nOur results provide limited evidence for a beneficial\neffect of low-GI diets with regard to body weight, BMI\nor CVD risk factors in an older British population. The\nrelationship between GI and CVD risk may not exist in\nthis population, or may be confounded by factors such\nas pre-existing CVD (58% taking cardiovascular medi-\ncations) or diabetes (15% taking endocrine medi-\ncations). Furthermore, regression analyses may be\nunder-powered and subject to attenuation of dietary\nGI\u2013CVD risk factor associations, the result of regression\ndilution bias introduced by unreliable dietary GI\nestimates60.\nNo data are available on frequencies of individual or\ngroups of foods consumed. Dairy products and high-fibre\nfoods have low GI38, but may affect anthropometric\nvariables, BP or dyslipidaemia differently due to variability\nin fibre, micronutrient, antinutrient and antioxidant levels\nfor example. Our final regression analysis found\ninteractions between fibre and GI in some outcome\nvariables, indicating that a high dietary GI may be more\nimportant in low- compared with high-fibre diets. The\ninterrelationships between GI, fibre and CVD risk warrant\nfurther research. A factorial RCT could provide key\ncarbohydrate-containing foods and compare the CVD risk\nprofiles of four groups following combinations of low- or\nhigh-GI and low- or high-fibre diets. Alternatively, large\nRCTs could be used to examine the effect of GI on\nanthropometric and CVD risk factors, while prospective\nstudies assessing food intake longitudinally with anthro-\npometric, biochemical and CVD outcomes would be\ninformative.\nThis study shows some associations between dietary GI\nand measures of obesity, BP and lipoprotein profile in an\nolder British population, prior to adjusting for potential\nconfounding factors. However, there is very limited\nevidence in an elderly population to justify advice to\nlower dietary GI for CVD prevention.\nAcknowledgements\nSources of funding: None.\nConflict of interest declaration: None.\nAuthorship responsibilities: J.E.M. was involved in\nformulating the hypotheses, supervising the calculation\nof dietary GI and undertaking the statistical analysis, and\ninterpreting the results.
