Furthermore the influence of antioxidant status (vitamin levels) and genetic susceptibility of individuals with regard to DNA damage was also investigated. There was no significant correlation for individuals between the levels of vitamin A, vitamin E, vitamin C and folate with M1dG and 8-oxodG adducts as well as M1dG adducts with total PAH (bulky) or B[a]P DNA adducts. The interesting find from this study was the significant negative correlation between the level of 8-oxodG adducts and the level of total PAH (bulky) and B[a]P DNA adducts implying the that the repair of oxidative DNA damage may be enhanced. This correlation was most significant for those individuals that were non smokers or those unexposed to environmental air pollution. Furthermore the significant inverse correlation between 8-oxodG and B[a]P DNA adducts was confined to individuals carrying the wild type genotype for both the GSTM1 and the GSTT1 gene (separately and interacting).

Populations exposed to environmental air pollution show increased levels of \nPAH DNA adducts and it has been postulated that another contributing cause of \ncarcinogenicity by environmental air pollution may be the production of reactive \noxygen species following oxidative stress leading to oxidative DNA damage. The \nantioxidant status as well as the genetic profile of an individual should in theory \ngovern the amount of protection afforded against the deleterious effects associated \nwith exposure to environmental air pollution. In this study we investigated the \nformation of total PAH (bulky) and B[a]P DNA adducts following exposure of \nindividuals to environmental air pollution in three metropolitan cities and the effect on \nendogenously derived oxidative DNA damage. Furthermore the influence of \nantioxidant status (vitamin levels) and genetic susceptibility of individuals with regard \nto DNA damage was also investigated. There was no significant correlation for \nindividuals between the levels of vitamin A, vitamin E, vitamin C and folate with \nM1dG and 8-oxodG adducts as well as M1dG adducts with total PAH (bulky) or B[a]P \nDNA adducts. The interesting find from this study was the significant negative \ncorrelation between the level of 8-oxodG adducts and the level of total PAH (bulky) \nand B[a]P DNA adducts implying the that the repair of oxidative DNA damage may \nbe enhanced. This correlation was most significant for those individuals that were non \nsmokers or those unexposed to environmental air pollution. Furthermore the \nsignificant inverse correlation between 8-oxodG and B[a]P DNA adducts was \nconfined to individuals carrying the wild type genotype for both the GSTM1 and the \n 3\nGSTT1 gene (separately and interacting). This effect was not observed for individuals \ncarrying the null variant. \n 4\n 1. Introduction \nThere is evidence that populations exposed to urban pollution show increased levels \nof polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) DNA adducts, supporting the hypothesis \nthat PAHs are significant contributors to the genotoxicity and carcinogenicity of air \npollution in the urban environment [1], [2] and [3]. Examples include DNA samples \nfrom bus drivers in Copenhagen [4], and from populations living in regions with \nincreased pollution in Czech Republic [5] and [6], and Poland [7]. In contrast to this, \nother studies have not shown a similar relationship. Thus, for example, no relationship \nwas found between exposure to particle-bound PAHs and DNA adduct formation \nwhen two populations in Greece were compared, and exposure to environmental \ntobacco was proposed as a more significant determinant of DNA damage [8].The \nexplanation of this finding may be due to the lower levels of PAHs observed in \nGreece compared to the Czech Republic or Poland.  \nAmbient air contains a highly complex mixture of components, and it has been \npostulated that another contributing cause of carcinogenicity may be the production of \nreactive oxygen species (ROS), which can oxidatively modify DNA. Thus exposure to \nrespirable particulate matter (PM) has been shown to induce production of ROS [9] \nand increase levels of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2\u2019deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) in vitro and in \nvivo in experimental systems (reviewed in Risom et al. and Sorensen et al. [10] and \n[11]). For example in a population of students whose personal exposure to respirable \nparticulate matter (PM2.5) was monitored, a correlation was found between 8-oxodG \nadducts in lymphocyte DNA, and the extent of personal exposure to PM2.5 [12]. A \nsignificant relationship has also been observed between 8-oxodG adducts in lungs \ninduced by diesel exhaust particles (DEP) and lung tumour incidence in mice [13]. \n 5\nThe mechanism by which these ROS are produced is uncertain. Three possibilities are \nthat the radicals are derived (a) from inflammatory responses caused by the particles, \n(b) from Fenton radical mediated processes involving particle-associated transition \nmetals, or (c) from redox cycling processes associated with metabolism of \nxenobiotics. If the latter was the case PAHs could be involved because of the \nformation of quinone metabolites of PAHs, which can induce ROS via redox cycling. \nScheme 1 shows how exposure to carcinogenic PAHs (c-PAHs) such as \nbenzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) could lead to the generation of oxidative DNA damage as \nwell as the formation of B[a]P DNA adducts following activation to the reactive \nmetabolite, B[a]P diol epoxide. The catechol metabolite is regenerated by NADPH-\ndependent two electron reduction of the quinone metabolite resulting in redox cycling. \n[9], [14], [15] and [16] \nFactors that may influence the extent of oxidative damage in humans include \nenvironmental factors such as exposure to tobacco smoke and passive smoke, intake \nof food-derived antioxidants, and genetic polymorphisms. The latter could be \nassociated for example with DNA repair of oxidative damage products in DNA (e.g. \n8-oxodG glycosylase, OGG1) or with enzymes involved in the metabolism of \nxenobiotics that act as an indirect source of free radicals. Genetic polymorphisms in \ngenes involved in metabolism and detoxification such as CYP1A1, GSTM1, GSTT1 \nand NAT2 could potentially affect the susceptibility of an individual to the adverse \neffects of environmental air pollution [17] and [18]. Glutathione S-transferases \n(GSTs) are a class of phase II enzymes, which can detoxify PAH epoxides as well as \nquinones, and hydroperoxides, formed as a consequence of oxidative stress, by \nconjugation with gluthathione [19]. The frequency of individuals with homozygous \ndeletions for the GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes is relatively high ranging from 20 to 50% \n 6\nfor the majority of populations that have been studied, showing the null genotype \n[20]. The effect of these polymorphisms in the current study is reported by Garte et al. \n[21]. Antioxidants have an important role in minimising the amount of oxidative DNA \ndamage that may arise. For example a study conducted with male smokers and non \nsmokers who received an antioxidant supplement consisting of vitamin C and E as \nwell as \u03b2-carotene, resulted in the reduction of the level of oxidised damage in \nlymphocyte DNA by 40% compared to individuals given a placebo [22]. Studies in \nvitro have shown that the level of oxidative DNA damage is reduced following the \nexposure of HepG2 cells pretreated with vitamins E and C, to ambient air particles \nwith complex mixtures of organic compounds adsorbed onto their surface [23]. \nAnother in vitro study showed clearly that the antioxidants present in lung lining fluid \nprovided protection against the oxidative DNA damaging effects of respirable \nparticulate matter [24]. \nIn this paper we will describe the results obtained for total PAH (bulky) and B[a]P \nDNA adducts following exposure of individuals to environmental air pollution and \ncomparisons with endogenously derived oxidative DNA damage as well as the effect \nof vitamin levels and genetic susceptibility on DNA damage. \n 7\n2. Materials and methods \n \n2.1. The study population \nThe population under study is described in detail elsewhere [25] and [26], but in brief \nthe exposed group was a total of 204 individuals, selected from Prague (Czech \nRepublic) (city policemen), Kosice (Slovak Republic) (city policemen), and Sofia \n(Bulgaria) (city policemen and bus drivers) [26]. Unexposed controls, who were non-\noccupationally exposed to traffic pollutants were selected and matched for age and \ngender (152 individuals). Blood samples were collected from each participant for \ndetermination of DNA adduct levels, genetic susceptibility, and determination of \nother biomarkers [25]. A questionnaire was completed by each individual providing \ndemographic, smoking and dietary information. \n \n2.3. Biomarkers of DNA damage \nAs a measure of oxidative DNA damage, 8-oxodG was determined by liquid \nchromatography-tandem mass spectrometry selected reaction monitoring (LC-MS\/MS \nSRM) in post-shift lymphocyte DNA samples from 98 exposed individuals and 105 \ncontrols from Prague and Kosice. A second measurement of oxidative stress was the \ndetermination of the malondialdehyde DNA adduct, M1dG by an immunoslot blot \nassay in post-shift lymphocyte DNA from 198 exposed and 156 control individuals \nfrom all three cities. \nAs biomarkers of exposure to PAHs, total PAH (bulky) adducts and the specific \nadduct arising from B[a]P were measured in lymphocyte DNA, using 32P-\npostlabelling and following protocols described elsewhere [27].  \n \n 8\n2.3. Determination of vitamin levels \nVitamin C (ascorbic acid) was determined in plasma of the individuals using \nspectrophotometry method as previously described by Kiyoh and Megumi [28]. \nVitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) and vitamin A were determined by using a HPLC-UV \ndetection method described by Driskell et al. following n-heptane extraction from the \nplasma [29]. \nThe CEDIA folate kit (Roche Diagnostics, Prague, Czech Republic) was used for the \ndetermination of folates (FA) in plasma. Sorbation was measured on the ELISA \nReader Spectra (TECAN) at wavelength 415 nm (with the reference wavelength 630 \nnm and the limit of detection 0.6 ng\/ml). According to Roche Diagnostics, the level of \nFA in healthy population corresponds to 2.7 \u2013 16.1 ng\/ml (6.1-36.5 nmol\/L).  \n \n2.4. Cotinine analysis \nUrinary cotinine levels as a marker of active and passive smoking were analyzed by \nradioimmunoassay [30]. Subjects with cotinine levels greater than 500 ng\/mg of \ncreatinine were considered smokers. \n \n2.5. Statistical analysis \nDue to the differences in adducts levels across the three countries (see paper 1), \nadducts levels were standardized, dividing values by the average of each adduct in the \ncorresponding country. Data on 8-oxodG, M1dG, bulky DNA adducts and B[a]P DNA \nadducts levels are presented as means and standard deviations (SD). Smoking status \nhas been defined according to cotinine levels (adjusted by creatinine levels): subjects \nwere defined as smokers when cotinine levels were greater than 500 ng cotinine\/mg of \ncreatinine, passive smokers when cotinine levels were comprised between 200 and \n 9\n500 ng cotinine\/mg, and non smokers when cotinine levels were lower than 200 ng \ncotinine\/mg. Using the measurements of personal exposure obtained with the personal \nmonitors, subjects were reclassified as exposed when personal exposure was greater \nthan the median value of average exposure of not occupationally exposed subjects, i.e. \n7.55 ng\/m3, and as non exposed when personal exposure values were lower or equal \nto 7.55 ng\/m3.  \nThe correlation between oxidative DNA damage (8-oxodG and M1dG adducts levels) \nand environmental exposure (bulky DNA adducts and B[a]P DNA adducts levels, \nvitamins and folate levels) were assessed by Pearson correlation analysis. The \ninteraction with smoking and PAHs exposure was assessed performing the correlation \nanalysis stratified by smoking status (current smokers, passive smokers, and non \nsmokers), by exposure status (exposed versus unexposed both using job definition and \nmonitor measurements) and metabolic polymorphism genes. \nP values lower than 0.05 were considered as statistically significant. All the statistical \nanalyses were performed using SAS statistical package (8.1 Version, SAS Institute \nInc., Cary, NC). \n \n 10\n3. Results \nA total of 354 individuals were included in the present analysis. The 8-oxodG adduct \nlevels were not measured in the DNA samples from Bulgaria, while B[a]P DNA \nadduct levels for the samples from the Slovak Republic could not be used for the \nanalysis because they were below the limit of detection. \nThe means and Standard Deviations (SD) of vitamins and folate are shown in table 1 \nand table 2 shows the results of the correlation analysis between the oxidative DNA \ndamage markers (M1dG and 8-oxodG adducts levels) and the DNA exposure markers \n(B[a]P and bulky DNA adducts levels) as well as antioxidant levels (vitamin levels). \nThe M1dG adducts are not associated with either B[a]P adducts or bulky DNA \nadducts, while the correlation between 8-oxodG and B[a]P DNA adducts and bulky \nDNA adducts is statistically significant, p = 0.002 and 0.036, respectively. The \nPearson correlation coefficient is negative, thus indicating that with increasing levels \nof B[a]P and bulky DNA adducts the level of 8-oxodG adducts is decreased (figure 1). \nThe oxidative DNA damage markers do not correlate with vitamin levels. When \nstratified by smoking status (table 3) and c-PAHs exposure status (both monitor and \njob definition) (tables 4 and 5), the correlation between 8-oxodG adducts and \nexposure markers persists strongly in non smokers and in unexposed subjects. The \ngroup of subjects exposed to passive smoking (n = 25) is very small, therefore it is \ndifficult to reach conclusions on the effect of passive smoking on 8-oxodG adduct \nlevels. \nThe correlation between 8-oxodG and B[a]P DNA adducts is strongly influenced by \ngenetic susceptibility (table 6): individuals carrying the wild type genotype for both \nthe GSTM1 and the GSTT1 gene (separately and interacting) show a significant \n 11\nstrong inverse correlation between the two adducts, while this effect disappears in \nindividuals carrying the null variant. \n 12\n4. Discussion  \nA significant contribution to the genotoxicity and carcinogenicity in humans of \nexposure to air pollution present in the urban environment appears to be related to the \ncontent of PAHs. It is generally found that populations exposed to environmental air \npollution show increased levels of PAH DNA adducts [1]. There is evidence linking \nthe metabolism of PAHs with the generation of ROS and oxidative stress [15] and \n[16]. It has been postulated that another contributing cause of carcinogenicity by \nenvironmental air pollution may be the production of ROS following oxidative stress \nleading to oxidative DNA damage. We investigated the formation of total PAH \n(bulky) and B[a]P DNA adducts following exposure of individuals to environmental \nair pollution and the effect on endogenously derived oxidative DNA damage as well \nas the effect of vitamin levels on DNA damage and genetic susceptibility. \nAntioxidants present in the diet in theory should provide protection against the \ndeleterious effects of xenobiotics that have the potential or lead to the induction of \noxidative stress [31] and [32]. There was no significant correlation found for \nindividuals between the levels of vitamin A, vitamin E, vitamin C and folate with \nM1dG and 8-oxodG adducts. Analogous findings were observed when the results were \nanalysed according to the smoking status, job definition and air monitor level. A \nSimilar observation was reported by Collins et al., with no correlation being observed \nbetween 8-oxodG adducts in lymphocyte DNA and the antioxidant status in \nindividuals from five European countries [33]. A study involving men on high fruit \nand vegetable diets again failed to find any correlation with level of 8-oxodG adducts \nexcreted into the urine [34]. These findings conflict with the generally accepted \nconsensus of opinion that an intake of fruits and vegetables by healthy individuals \nleads to a reduction of oxidative DNA damage [35]. A study involving coke-oven \n 13\nworkers who took at least one multi vitamin pill showed that the urinary excretion of \n8-oxodG adducts was decreased compared to those workers that took no vitamins \n[36]. In a separate study the level of M1dG adducts was found to be decreased in \nhuman colorectal mucosa DNA from men that had a diet with high levels of fruit and \nvegetables [37].  \nThe level of M1dG adducts for individuals did not show any correlation with total \nPAH (bulky) or B[a]P DNA adducts. Implying that exposure to PAHs does not have \nany significant influence on the pathways involved in the formation or removal of \nM1dG adducts. The mechanism of formation of M1dG adducts involves free radical \nmediated lipid peroxidation resulting in the generation of malondialdehyde that can \nreact with DNA [38]. Another potential source of M1dG adducts can be from \nmalondialdehyde that is generated as a by-product of prostaglandin biosynthesis [39]. \nFormation of M1dG adducts can also occur independently from lipid peroxidation by \nthe generation of base propenals, which are formed by the hydroxyl radical mediated \nremoval of the deoxyribose 4'-hydrogen in DNA [40]. The repair of M1dG adducts is \nmediated by a nucleotide excision repair pathway [41]. \nThe interesting finding from this study was that there was a significant negative \ncorrelation between the level of 8-oxodG adducts and the level of total PAH (bulky) \nand B[a]P DNA adducts. The correlation was most significant for those individuals \nthat were non smokers or those unexposed to environmental air pollution. This finding \ncontradicts what would be expected to occur as a consequence of the pathway \ninvolving the metabolism of PAHs by aldo-keto reductase to generate catechols and \nsubsequent redox cycling, resulting in the generation ROS, leading to potentially \nincreased levels of oxidative DNA damage (refer to Scheme 1) [15] and [16]. The \nliterature contains reports of numerous studies to ascertain whether ROS production \n 14\nand PAH metabolism are related and often resulting in conflicting conclusions. For \nexample the level of 8-oxodG adducts was shown to be elevated in liver, kidney and \nlung following dosing of rats orally with B[a]P [42]. Dietary administration of DEP to \nBig Blue rats\u00ae resulted in an elevation of bulky DNA adducts in colon and liver DNA \nbut no increase in 8-oxodG adduct levels in these tissues or in the urine [43]. In \ncontrast inhalation of DEP by Big Blue\u00ae rats resulted in increased 8-oxodG adduct \nlevels and in increased bulky DNA adducts in lung DNA [44]. There was no \ncorrelation found between the level of PAH DNA adducts and the level of urinary 8-\noxodG adducts in non smoking Danish bus drivers and postal workers working in \nrural\/suburban and city centre locations [4]. Also no correlation was found between \nthe level of PAH DNA adducts and the level of 8-oxodG adducts in lymphocyte DNA \nobtained from individuals with and without lung cancer [45]. No associations between \nPAH DNA adducts and different oxidative DNA damage adducts including 8-oxodG \nwere observed in cancerous and surrounding normal larynx tissues obtained from \nsmoking individuals [46]. However in coke oven workers who were exposed to \nvarying amounts of PAHs, a weak positive correlation was found between 8-oxodG \nadducts and PAH DNA adducts in the white blood cell DNA, but no correlation \nbetween 8-oxodG levels and urinary 1-hydroxypyrene, a metabolite used for \nmonitoring exposure to pyrene [47]. Experiments using cell-free systems have shown \nthat the oxidative capacity of respirable particulate matter was more associated with \nan aqueous extract of the particles rather than with an organic extract which contained \nmost of the DNA adduct-yielding PAHs [48]. \nAlternatively a mechanism unrelated to PAH metabolism, involving inflammation \nmay be occurring. Exposure to respirable particulate matter can result in the influx of \nalveolar macrophages, which in turn can generate free radicals leading to oxidative \n 15\nstress [14]. Intratracheal injections of the carbonaceous (particulate) part of diesel \nparticles resulted in increases in 8-oxodG adduct levels in the lung tissue of mice but \nno increase was observed when PAHs such as B[a]P were introduced into the mice. \nThus highlighting the involvement of alveolar macrophages in generation of hydroxyl \nradicals as a consequence of phagocytosis [49]. The levels of 8-oxodG adducts may \nalso be increased as a consequence of Fenton radical mediated processes that involve \ntransition metals which are associated respirable particulate matter [11]. \nA possible reason for the decrease in levels of 8-oxodG adducts with increasing PAH \nDNA adducts observed in this study may be explained by the induction of increased \noxidative DNA damage repair as a consequence of exposure to environmental air \npollution. Evidence for this is provided by Risom et al. who found that there was an \nup-regulation of expression of the oxidative DNA damage repair enzyme DNA \nglycosylase OGG1 in the lung following repeated exposure of mice to diesel exhaust \nparticles by inhalation. A single dose of diesel exhaust particles resulted in increased \nlevels of 8-oxodG in the lung tissue but these levels returned to steady state levels \nfollowing repeated dosing as consequence of increased DNA repair [50]. Furthermore \nToraason et al. concluded that there was an induction of DNA repair mechanisms in \ncoal-tar exposed roofers over time as determined by a statistically significant decrease \nin white blood cell 8-oxodG adduct levels and an increase in the urinary excretion of \n8-oxodG [51]. A similar conclusion was made by Briede et al., when they \nadministered a single oral dose of B[a]P to rats and observed a decrease in the levels \nof 8-oxodG adducts with the formation of bulky DNA adducts in liver and lung and \nconsequent increase in the level 8-oxodG excreted into the urine again implying the \ninduction of DNA repair mechanisms [52]. \n 16\nThe negative correlation between 8-oxodG and B[a]P DNA adducts was strongly \npositively influenced by individuals carrying the wild type genotype for both the \nGSTM1 and the GSTT1 gene (both separately or interacting), while this effect \ndisappeared in individuals carrying the null variant. The general consensus of opinion \nis that the GSTM1 null genotype confers an enhanced risk of susceptibility to \ndeveloping cancer following exposure environmental air pollution. In contrast GSTT1 \nnull genotype does not seem to be associated with cancer risk. The increased risk of \ncancer development following exposure to environmental air pollution in the GSTM1 \nnull genotype individuals may be as a consequence of increased formation of DNA \nadducts. Topinka et al. showed that placental bulky DNA adducts were higher in \nenvironmentally air pollution exposed populations with GSTM1 null genotype \ncompared to populations with the GSTM1 present genotype [53]. A similar \nobservation was made for non smoking students exposed to urban air pollution and \nenvironmental tobacco smoke [54]. It has been shown that never smoking women \nwith the null GSTM1 genotype have a statistically significant greater risk of \ndeveloping lung cancer from exposure to environmental tobacco smoke [55]. A \nsimilar conclusion was reached by Lan et al. who studied the lung cancer risk of \nindividuals exposed to indoor coal combustion emissions [56]. The results from this \nstudy imply that the presence of detoxification enzymes such as GSTs may result in \nthe reduction in the level of reactive PAH quinone metabolites thus lowering the level \nof oxidative DNA damage by subsequent redox cycling. However the formation of \nPAH DNA adducts may remain unaffected following metabolism via the PAH diol \nepoxide pathway (scheme 1). \nIn conclusion the contribution to the genotoxicity and carcinogenicity in humans \nfollowing exposure to air pollution present in the urban environment appears not be \n 17\nrelated just to one factor and consideration of the influence of a combination of \nfactors such as oxidative DNA damage, PAH DNA adducts, antioxidant status and \ngenetic susceptibility is required. \n \n 18\nAcknowledgement.
