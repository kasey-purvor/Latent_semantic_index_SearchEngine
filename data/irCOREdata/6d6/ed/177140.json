The subjective nature of \nquality of life is pertinent to this area of study as most measures of assessment \ninclude self-reports.  Questions are sometimes ambiguous and cover a wide range of \nhealth-related symptoms, particularly in generic, non-disease specific instruments.  \nThus, the researcher faces the challenge of gaining insight into the complex and \nongoing cognitive processes engaged in by respondents when completing HRQOL \nquestionnaires.  This is an important challenge as respondents are likely to vary in \nthe implicit reference frame comparisons they employ when evaluating their own \nHRQOL[1].  It is likely that this variation will affect responses to HRQOL items and \nlead to an incomplete understanding of the outcome under assessment. \n \nA study conducted by Fayers et al. [2] found that the majority of questionnaire \nparticipants reported using reference frame comparisons when completing an annual \nHRQOL questionnaire.  Only 33% of participants, however, reported using the same \ncomparison reference frame at each yearly interval.  No pattern was observed to \nexplain the changes in reference frame choice.  Reported reference frames were \nassociated with effects of similar magnitude to the differences in HRQOL that are \nregarded as clinically important. The authors suggested that reference frame choice \nmay be of particular concern in trials that randomise patients to management in \ndifferent settings, such as treatment at home \/ in hospital, or surgery \/chemotherapy, \nand might bias or obscure HRQOL differences.   \nIt is therefore important to understand what the term \u2018quality of life\u2019 means to people \nand how this influences their interpretation of health-related quality of life \nquestionnaires.  The aims of this present qualitative study are: \n1. To substantiate the supplementary questions used by Fayers et al. [2]. \n2. To use cognitive interviewing techniques [3] to gain insight into how people \nevaluate their quality of life when completing a HRQOL questionnaire. \n \n 3 \nMethods \nStudy sample \nParticipants were drawn from a UK multicentre, randomised controlled trial of \nintensive bisphosphonate therapy versus symptomatic treatment in patients with \nPaget\u2019s disease (The PRISM Trial, ISRCTN12989577) [4].  Paget\u2019s disease is a \nchronic metabolic bone disorder characterised by increased bone turnover.  In total, \n1331 patients were enrolled in PRISM.   \nA group of 87 PRISM participants were invited to participate in this study.  Patients \nwere excluded if they were unable to speak English, had less than one year life \nexpectancy, or had limited hearing ability.  Purposive sampling was used to achieve \nmaximum variation across: \n\u2022 Age \n\u2022 Gender \n\u2022 Severity of Paget\u2019s disease, indicated by time since diagnosis, number of \nbones affected, bone pain and serum total alkaline phosphatase level. \n\u2022 Years since recruitment to the trial \n\u2022 SF-36 general health score \n\u2022 Response to self-rated quality of life questionnaire items (see figure I). \n \nLetters of invitation and study information leaflets were mailed to potential \nparticipants.  Twenty-two people (25%) replied wishing to join the study.  One person \nwas subsequently excluded due to difficulty arranging an interview.   \nWritten informed consent was obtained at the time of interview.  Five participants \nwere interviewed in consulting rooms within a hospital outpatient setting.  The \nremainder were interviewed in their own homes.   Two researchers (CR & SS) \ncarried out the interviews.  Taped interviews were transcribed, removing any \npersonal identifying information.   \nEthical Approval \nThe study received multi-centre research ethics committee, relevant local research \nethics committee and hospital trust approval.  \n 4 \nQuestionnaires \nAll participants had previously completed an annual questionnaire as part of the \nPRISM trial containing validated health assessment instruments: EuroQoL (EQ-5D), \nmeasuring general health status [5], the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-Form \nHealth Survey (SF-36, v2) assessing overall health status and eight health domains \n[6], and the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) Disability Index of the extent of \nfunctional ability [7].  Four supplementary quality of life questions, as described in \nFayers et al [2] (see figure I) were added after the SF-36 and before the HAQ.  The \nfirst two items (B12, B13) used the same response options as items one and two of \nthe SF-36 but asked about quality of life instead of health.  These were followed by \nan open-response item (B14) and finally a more specific item about comparison \nreference frames (B15).  Participants could tick one or more of the response options \nin B15 or use the text box to provide an open response.  These supplementary \nquestions were designed to assess reported quality of life and to probe the use of \nself-comparison reference frames. \n 5 \nFigure I.  Supplementary Questions  \n \n \n \n \nB12.  How would you rate your quality of life during the past week? \n      Excellent    Very Good   Good          Fair          Poor \n \n \nB13. Compared to one year ago, how would you rate your quality of life in general now? \n      Excellent    Very Good   Good          Fair          Poor \n \n \nB14. We realise that different people have different things in mind when they answer \nquestions about their \u2018quality of life\u2019.  What things were you thinking about when you \nassessed your quality of life? \n Please write your answers in this box \n \n \n \nB15.  When you rated your overall quality of life, were you mainly: \n \nComparing yourself against before you became ill? \n \nComparing yourself against how you felt one year ago? \n \nComparing yourself against other people with Paget\u2019s disease? \n \nComparing yourself against healthy people that you know  \n   (such as friends or family)? \n \nOr thinking of something else? \n \nIf you were thinking of something else, please tell us what it was:  \n \n Please write your answers in this box \n \n \n \n 6 \nCognitive interviews \nThe processes employed by respondents were investigated by interviewing \nparticipants who had previously completed a PRISM trial questionnaire (either at \nbaseline or annual follow-up).  The interviews were between 3-12 months after \nprevious questionnaire assessment.  Probes, e.g. \u2018can you tell me what you were \nthinking\u2019, were used to assist the respondents\u2019 reconstruction of the thought \nprocesses that may have been employed.  Interviews were semi-structured with a \npre-defined topic guide, which was intended to standardise the interview and \nminimise bias.    \nAn interpretative phenomenological analysis approach was adopted.  This is a \nqualitative technique in which participants\u2019 responses to a given phenomenon, in this \ncase quality of life, are interpreted by the researcher along relevant themes.   \nParticipant responses were coded in a chart under theme headings.  New themes \nwere added to the analysis as they emerged from the interviews.  Two members of \nthe research team (CR, SS) independently coded responses under theme headings.  \nCoding disagreements were resolved through discussions amongst the research \nteam.  The analysis was, therefore an iterative process, aimed at identifying a wide \nrange of themes of importance to the participants.  Sampling continued until no new \ninformation emerged from the interviews and data saturation was achieved [8]. \nAn example of how themes were arranged under topic headings is shown appendix I.   \n \nResults \nCharacteristics of Study Population \nThe sample comprised 21 participants, 11 men and 10 women, aged between 59\u201391 \nyears, mean 63 years.  Seven people had one bone affected by Paget\u2019s disease, 14 \npeople had more than one bone affected, ranging from 2-7 bones (mean 3.5).  \nDiagnosis of Paget\u2019s disease was 1-31 years previously, with a mean disease \nduration of 10.6 years.  Other characteristics of the sample, chosen to successfully \nreflect the diversity of PRISM participants in line with our purposive sampling \nstrategy, are described in Table I. \n 7 \nTable I.

People enjoying good health (n=10) described this as contributing to a \ngood overall quality of life.  Those in variable health (n=7) were also more satisfied \nwith their quality of life than were people in poorer health (n=4).  All participants \nstated that quality of life included factors other than health. \nThree patients said that treatment for Paget\u2019s disease improved quality of life, \nalthough the side effects of bisphosphonate medication negatively impacted on two \npeople.  Two people referred to using medical aids (such as hearing aids, shoe \nhorns).  This reference was made in the context of assisting quality of life, although \nthe status of their overall health had reduced their quality of life.  Two people \ndescribed feeling dissatisfaction with their clinical treatment.  This was discussed in \nreference to poor continuity of care if consultations occurred with numerous \nhealthcare professionals, or occurred infrequently, defined as less than 3 physician \nappointments per year.  One participant also expressed frustration that their \ntreatment was orientated towards pain management rather than elimination of all \nsymptoms.   \nFour people reported a reduction in energy levels.  This was mentioned as impeding \ntheir ability to carry out or enjoy leisure activities, which caused irritation.  This did not \ncause people to evaluate their quality of life as being poor.  Rather, it was mentioned \nin relation to increased energy being desirable to improve quality of life. \n 9 \nTable II:  Themes discussed during the interview \n Theme Content n  \n1: Health Status  \n Good health 10 \n Poor health 4 \n Variable 7 \n2: Pain \n Pain not discussed 2 \n Pain discussed 19 \n Attributable pain discussed 15 \n Non-attributable pain discussed 4 \n3: Mobility \n Reduced mobility not discussed 6 \n Mobility reduction discussed 15 \n Difficulty walking discussed 15 \n Difficulty with basic activities discussed 9 \n4: Emotional Impact of Paget\u2019s disease \n Emotional impact not discussed 15 \n Emotional impact discussed 6 \n Loss of independence discussed 6 \n Frustration with physical limitations discussed 5 \n5: Disease and\/or Age Adjustment \n Adjustment not discussed 4 \n Adjustment discussed 17 \n Disease adjustment discussed 12 \n Age adjustment discussed 7 \n Disease and age adjustment discussed together 2 \n \nPain \nPresence of pain was a dominant theme, although the intensity of the pain described \nwas variable.  Discussion included general bodily pain as well as pain caused by \nPaget\u2019s disease.  Where people experienced a lot of pain it was usually described in \nterms of its incapacitating effect on daily activities.  One participant noted that \npresence of pain did not deter him from functioning as normal and therefore pain did \nnot reduce quality of life.  Furthermore, when we examined the self-rated quality of \nlife scores for those participants who discussed pain, only two of the participants had \nrated their quality of life as \u2018Fair\u2019 while the rest had rated their quality of life as \u2018Good\u2019. \nFifteen participants mentioned experiencing pain that was attributed to a physical \nactivity, such as gardening or walking.  This type of pain was expected and therefore \nmanageable.  Transient, non-attributable pain, however, was described as being \nparticularly difficult to cope with, due to its unpredictability.  Non-attributable pain also \n 10 \ngave concern to one participant who thought this was an indication that their Paget\u2019s \ndisease was spreading to other areas of the skeleton. \nEight people reported analgesia usage to cope with their pain.  All reluctantly \naccepted analgesia usage was necessary for coping with pain.  The effect on quality \nof life was therefore contradictory. The pain relieving properties improved quality of \nlife, but their use created feelings of personal dissatisfaction.  Three people also \ndiscussed pain as reducing spousal and other relatives\u2019 quality of life.  This was \ndiscussed both in terms of participants requiring help from their relatives or not being \nable to give help, such as acting as a carer for a spouse or being able to help \nchildren with babysitting. \nMobility \nFifteen participants mentioned experiencing reduced mobility.  The effect on quality \nof life greatly depended on how severely mobility was restricted.  Mobility restriction \nwas usually discussed in terms of reduced walking ability but also involved carrying \nout other basic activities such as dressing oneself, or the requirement of functional \naids.   Where participants faced difficulties in carrying out daily activities they often \nstated that they felt \u201clazy\u201d for taking frequent rests or were dissatisfied with how they \nhad completed the activity.  Where participants\u2019 mobility allowed them to carry out \ndaily activities to high or satisfactory levels, this was expressed with pride and was \nconsidered to be an achievement when taking their age into consideration.  Keeping \nactive was also mentioned as promoting mental fitness. \nSocial Function \nTwelve people discussed being physically able to maintain social contact as being \nimportant.  Having regular contact and social interaction with one\u2019s immediate family, \ni.e. children and grandchildren, was considered especially important.  Reduced \nmobility sometimes impeded the ability to socialise with friends or family and this \nnegatively affected quality of life.  Three people mentioned the support given by their \nspouse in terms of companionship and for physically engaging in social activities. \nEmotional Function \nSix people described the emotional impact of Paget\u2019s disease.  Loss of \nindependence and spontaneity were the main cause of upset.  Five participants \nmentioned feeling frustrated by their physical limitations, particularly in comparison to \n 11 \nprevious activity levels.  Three participants also felt that their disease limitations (e.g. \nslowness in walking, handling cutlery) had caused them public embarrassment.  \nAttitudes towards these limitations affected them greatly.  Participants stated that \ntheir family was a fundamental source of support when they required help due to a \nlack of mobility or physical strength.  Four people felt that accepting help caused \nfrustration at having to rely on others.   \nDisease and Age Adjustment \nThe majority of participants discussed making cognitive adjustments, either \nconsciously or unconsciously, to their perception of quality of life.  This was \ndescribed as changing the parameters for measuring a good standard of quality of \nlife.  Adjustments were made through acceptance of having a chronic disease, and \naccommodating symptoms so that quality of life was still judged as being favourable.  \nFor many this was achieved by adopting a \u2018positive outlook\u2019 through positive coping \nstrategies and an optimistic approach to life.  Eight people discussed how this \napproach had contributed to feeling \u2018happier\u2019 with their lives.  In contrast, one \nparticipant stated that their declining health had negatively influenced their ability to \nhave a positive outlook. \nSeven people made reference to adjusting for age related limitations, such as \nexperiencing general aches and reduced physical functioning.  People who made \nreference to undergoing disease and\/or age adjustment made more positive \nevaluations of their quality of life than those who made no reference to adjustment.  \nComparison between these two groups of people with the number of years they had \nbeen diagnosed with Paget\u2019s disease revealed no consistent pattern, suggesting that \ndisease adjustment is not a function of time spent with the disease.  \nReference Frames \nParticipants were probed to discuss whether they had particular comparison groups \nor reference frames in mind when deciding how to rate their overall quality of life \n(Table 3).  All participants confirmed that they had used at least one of the suggested \nself-comparisons, and of these seven stated during interview that they had more than \none of the themes in mind, although only three of these had ticked more than 1 \nquestionnaire option.   \n 12 \nSelf-comparison with 1 year ago \nEight participants described feeling a general decline in the last year, while two \nmentioned that they felt the same as they did one year ago.  Participants discussed \nthis reference frame as a comment on their health status during the interview rather \nthan as an evaluation of their quality of life. \nSelf-comparison before becoming ill   \nSeven participants made this comparison, either with respect to a specific time in the \npast such as before retirement, or to the past in general. Discussion was in the \ncontext of a reduction in health or mobility.  It was generally asserted that, although \ncomparison with the past revealed a reduction in quality of life, this did not influence \nratings of current quality of life.   \nComparison with others with Paget\u2019s disease  \nSpecific comparison with other people with Paget\u2019s disease was made by three \nparticipants.  In each case, the participant felt that the comparator had more \nsymptoms than themselves.  One participant commented that they had so few \nsymptoms that they didn\u2019t feel the need to make comparisons with other Paget\u2019s \ndisease sufferers.  Another person similarly mentioned that they would find it \n\u201cdepressing\u201d to make such a comparison and that they did not give much \nconsideration to their disease.  Most participants, however, did not know anyone else \nwith the condition. \nComparison with healthy people \nFive respondents made comparisons with healthy people.   Most felt that they were \nable to do as much, if not more as healthy people.  One person acknowledged that \nthey were not as physically fit as other healthy people.  Healthy comparators included \npeople known to the participants, for example friends or family, as well as other \nhealthy people in general (age matched and younger).   \nComparison with others of the same age \nA majority (17) of participants acknowledged having compared themselves to age-\nrelated peers.  This usually involved comparison with friends.  Comparisons were \nusually favourable, either due to others\u2019 ill health or due to peers enjoying relatively \ngood health for their age.  Two people added the caveat that comparison with friends \n 13 \nmay have been inaccurate as they could not be certain of the true nature of another \nperson\u2019s health or quality of life, but that they had nonetheless been influenced by \ntheir perception of the health of these peers. \nComparison with other non-healthy people \nThirteen participants said they had contrasted themselves against other non-healthy \npeople (i.e., not with Paget\u2019s disease), and this comparison included both non-\nhealthy people known to the participants, and reference to non-healthy people in \ngeneral.  Where people compared themselves to other non-healthy people they \nalways considered themselves to be in better health and with a higher standard of \nquality of life. \nTable III:  Reference frames \n \nTheme content n \nSelf-comparison 1 year ago 10 \nSelf-comparison before becoming ill 7 \nComparison with others with Paget\u2019s disease 3 \nComparison with healthy people 5 \nComparison with others of the same age 17 \nComparison with other non-healthy people 13 \n \nEmergent Themes \nIn addition to the response categories provided in the questionnaire, novel themes \nemerged from the interviews.  These are described below. \nTransient Reference Frames n=8 \nParticipants discussed changes in reference frames between questionnaire \ncompletion and interview.  This occurred in the context of questionnaire completion \nduring a \u2018bad week\u2019.  Pain was often a contributing factor to changes in reference \nframe comparison. \nInteraction of Reference Frames n=7 \nParticipants discussed using more than one reference frame during their evaluations \n(median = 2).  Reference frames often interacted in complex ways, e.g. simultaneous \ncomparison with healthy and non-healthy people.  This made it difficult for \nparticipants to describe their personal reference frames.  Interactions usually \n 14 \ninvolved comparison with self before becoming ill, healthy other and non-healthy \nother reference frames.  \nDifficulty Completing HRQOL Questionnaire n = 10 \nTen participants stated that they found the questionnaire problematic. These people \nhad difficulty rating quality of life due to the nebulous nature of the phenomenon.    \nConfusion also centred on whether evaluations should focus on overall HRQOL or on \nthe health condition under investigation only (n=3).  For three participants, \nquestionnaire items seemed irrelevant either to the participant or to trial aims.  \nParticipants picked the middle choice or \u2018happy medium\u2019 in this circumstance.  All \nwould have welcomed clearer instruction for completing the questionnaire. \nDiscussion \nThe interviews highlighted many common themes.  All participants stated that \nalthough their health was a consideration in evaluating quality of life, it was not the \nmost important factor.  This supports the observation that underlying health \nconditions do not consistently explain responses given in HRQOL questionnaires [9].  \nReduction in vitality was acknowledged as impacting on social functioning, \nparticularly in reference to maintaining social relationships.  Social interaction with \nfriends, and particularly family members, was mentioned as being very important for \nquality of life.  The benefits of having this type of support appear to be unrelated to \nthe severity of disease, i.e. people with greater symptoms did not place a higher \nvalue on social relationships than those who had fewer symptoms.   \nOptimism emerged as being an important factor in quality of life evaluation.  \nParticipants who accepted the limitations resulting from increasing age and chronic \ndisease were \u2018happier\u2019 with life.  This is in keeping with Langston et al. [4] who \nreported that the wider PRISM population showed minimal evidence of impaired \npsychological health or depression, despite having a significantly reduced quality of \nlife in physical functioning domains compared with the normal population.  \nEngagement in disease adjustment was not associated with the severity of Paget\u2019s \ndisease, as indicated at the patients\u2019 last clinic visit, or duration of disease.  Thus, it \nwould seem that there is not a consistent association between duration of disease \nand degree of adjustment.  Rather adjustment for age and disease appeared to \nreflect a subjective determination to evaluate life within the reduced margins.   \n 15 \nAdjustment was mainly described as being a conscious process that was deliberately \nadopted.  In contrast some people noted that they had come to terms with the \nchanges caused by age and disease automatically and only noticed limitations when \nthey had cause to reflect on the past.  This is consistent with previous theories of \nstability of self and homeostatic regulation of subjective well-being whereby a \nprevious level of subjective well-being is returned to through the process of cognitive \nbias when an external threat to self-satisfaction is encountered [10-13].  Only one \nparticipant considered their health to have negatively impacted on outlook.  In other \ncases where participants tended to be less optimistic this was due to factors \nunrelated to their health.  This demonstrates the subjectivity involved in the \nevaluation of quality of life and proves the difficulty in comparing people using \ngeneric quality of life rating scores.   \nIt was evident that participants engaged in both downward and upward social \ncomparisons when completing questionnaire items.  This reinforces the hypothesis \nthat people use comparison with others as a framework for shaping one\u2019s own \nexpectations [1, 2, 14-20].  Interestingly the participant scoring \u2018poor\u2019 on the SF36 item \nengaged in self-comparison one year ago and before becoming ill.  Comparisons \nwere both explicit, based on own experiences with others, and implicit, based on \ngeneral perceptions and beliefs.  Reference frames also changed over time and \ninteracted in complex ways, thus supporting our quantitative findings [2] and providing \nfurther evidence for the validity of using the supplementary HRQOL questions.  This \nalso supports the argument that subjective reference frames may create potential \nbias when HRQOL self-ratings are used in clinical trials or longitudinal studies [2].   \nThe current study findings are limited given the small sample size, the particular \ndisease group and the narrow age range of the participants.  The presence of the \ninterviewer may also have introduced bias during the interviews, although it is hoped \nthat this has been minimised as far as possible by the use of a topic guide to provide \na standardised interview format.  Due to the time required for arranging interviews \nfollowing questionnaire completion, the interviews were conducted several months \nafter the patients had completed the study questionnaires, including the \nsupplementary questions, and so it is unclear to what extent the responses \nrepresented the thought processes used at that time, or whether current, and newer, \nviews were being reflected; it would be interesting for a future study to use think \naloud techniques concurrently with questionnaire completion.  This approach is \nchallenging for many respondents, however, and may not be suitable for an elderly \n 16 \npopulation.  Further work could investigate the cognitive processes involved for those \nwho have poorer self-reported health, for patients with other diagnoses, and for those \nwith newly diagnosed illness.  It would also be interesting to compare what themes \nare important in the evaluation of quality of life among a healthy population to \nexamine how the perception of quality of life is influenced by the presence of a health \ncomplaint.  The current findings, however, represent an insight into how people with \ndisease evaluate their quality of life. \nConclusions \nThe findings of this study demonstrate that the underlying health condition does not \nconsistently explain HRQOL responses.  By uncovering the meanings people attach \nto their HRQOL scores we showed that choice of reference frame varies between \nand even within patients, and this influences self-reported quality of life.  This \nprovides support for the quantitative results described in Fayers et al [2].  We \nconclude that uncovering the meanings people attach to psychometrically sound \nmeasures of quality of life can assist in refining the accuracy and precision of future \nquality of life assessment tools.  Specifically, we suggest that the inclusion of \nsupplementary questions in HRQOL questionnaires is useful to identify the self-\ncomparison reference frames that could bias or obscure results.  Specifying a \nparticular reference frame for completing HRQOL questionnaires could further \nreduce ambiguity and aid measurement precision.   \nImportantly, half of the participants expressed uncertainty about the meaning or \nintention of the question about HRQOL, and stated that they would welcome clearer \ninstructions for completing the questionnaires.  We recommend that studies \nassessing HRQOL should explicitly state whether self-assessments should relate to \noverall quality of life, general HRQOL, or disease-specific HRQOL.  Clearer wording \nof items to clarify whether respondents should consider their index condition only or \nall health problems would be beneficial. \nAcknowledgements \nThe authors would like to thank all the participants who agreed to be interviewed and \nour colleagues who transcribed the interviews and to acknowledge the Chief Scientist \nOffice of the Scottish Government Health Directorates for funding this research, the \nPRISM funding bodies (the Arthritis Research Campaign, the National Association for \nthe Relief of Paget\u2019s disease and the Alliance for Better Bone Health) and all the \n 17 \ninvestigators who worked on the PRISM trial.
