Two standard fibre Bragg gratings (FBGs) of\nequal length and with the same Bragg wavelength are inscribed sequentially in single mode optical\nfibre, such that the FBGs overlap physically by one grating period.

The PSFBGs fabricated are compared with a model based on\na modified Rouard\u2019s method which is subsequently used to investigate the influence of translation\nstage errors on the fabrication of the PSFBGs. The model demonstrates that the strength\/reflectivity\nof the PSFBG influences the spectral-hole linewidth as well as the finesse of the device while the\nlength of the PSFBG affects only the linewidth of the spectral-hole but not the finesse of the device.\nThe PSFBG devices produced by this technique are reproducible and the fabrication process is fast\nand is well suited for the fabrication of WDM PSFBGs.\n21 Introduction\nPhase-shifted fibre Bragg gratings (PSFBGs) are used widely in distributed feedback (DFB) fibre\nlasers, providing very stable narrow linewidth wavelength sources [1]. PSFBGs are also employed as\nhigh finesse transmission filters [2], switching elements in dense wavelength-division-multiplexing\n(WDM) optical communication systems [3], and as sensors [4].\nA variety of techniques for the fabrication of PSFBGs have been reported previously. Limitations of\nthese methods often include the complexity of the fabrication system, fabrication tolerance,\nfabrication repeatability, fabrication time, full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) of the passband of the\nPSFBG, cost of fabrication, and the ability to fabricate WDM PSFBGs.\nA technique commonly used for producing PSFBGs uses a phase-shifted phase mask [5] in a single\nexposure process. The technique offers high repeatability and is fast and easy to implement.\nHowever, PSFBGs produced this way can only be written at one wavelength per phase mask. A\nnumber of phase masks will be required if WDM PSFBGs are required, making the technique\nrelatively expensive. PSFBGs have also been fabricated using the Moir\u00e9 method [6] in a double\nexposure process. This method fabricates two spatially co-located FBGs in a sequential exposure\nprocess. The fabrication conditions are altered between the two exposures such that the Bragg\nwavelengths differ slightly, e.g. by 0.3 nm. Methods that have been used to induce the difference in\nthe Bragg wavelengths include slight tuning of the emission wavelength of the writing laser [6],\nspatial displacement of the fibre perpendicular to the fibre axis, i.e. either towards or away from the\nfocusing lens [7], and the application of strain to the fibre [8] after writing the first FBG. The Moir\u00e9\nmethod requires high precision in the methods used to alter the fabrication conditions between the\ntwo exposures if the correct phase shift is to be induced. A UV post-processing technique [9] has also\nbeen investigated for PSFBG fabrication. This entails raising the local refractive index of part of an\nFBG by focusing a UV beam to a small spot, e.g. ~1 mm in the centre of a 4 cm long FBG [9],\nthereby creating a phase shift within the FBG structure. This technique requires accurate control of\nthe beam spot-size and positioning within the FBG in order to produce the correct phase shift.\nA moving fibre-scanning beam technique was used in conjunction with a uniform period phase mask\n[10] to fabricate PSFBGs [11] and multiple PSFBGs [12]. A high resolution stage was used to translate\nthe fibre by an appropriate distance at the desired time while the UV beam was scanning [13]. An\ninterferometer was implemented in order to determine accurately the position of the translation stage.\nA limitation of the technique is that the central wavelength of the PSFBG is limited to the\nwavelength of the phase mask and the technique is therefore not suited to the fabrication of WDM\n3PSFBGs. A commercial system, FiberGrate 2000 series (Aerotech Ltd), which offers the ability to\nfabricate FBGs using the point-by-point procedure with a resolution of up to 0.3 nm, has been\nlaunched [14]. The commercial system can be appropriately adopted for fabricating PSFBGs.\nHowever, the system is relatively expensive and so there is still room for the development of\nalternative more cost effective approaches.\nA technique that also uses a fixed, uniform period phase mask in combination with fibre translation\nto fabricate superstructure FBGs that incorporate single [15] and multiple [16] \uf070-phase shifts has been\ndemonstrated. The design of a superstructure PSFBG is however complex and also requires high\nprecision in the translation of the fibre. A technique which utilised a continuous wave UV laser was\nused to fabricate FBG devices of arbitrary apodisation. The illumination intensity and phase could be\nchanged continuously at each grating line [17]. During the writing process, the fibre was moved\nconstantly by a high-precision air-bearing translation stage, while the UV laser beam was switched\non\/off using a high precision electro-optical modulator which was controlled by a customised pulse\ntrain with nanosecond timing precision. The pulse train was synchronised with the writing position.\nThe writing procedure was repeated many times until the required reflectivity was achieved.\nPSFBGs were fabricated by inserting a delay in the pulse train. The technique demonstrated the\ncapability to fabricate gratings with arbitrary apodisation and phase design but is rather complex and\nutilises relatively expensive components. Several other variations of the techniques discussed above\nhave been demonstrated [18], [19] but all exhibit similar limitations. A comparison on the merits of the\nvarious techniques is provided in section 3 (Table 2).\nIn this paper, a procedure based upon a two-beam interferometer and fibre translation for fabricating\nPSFBGs is reported. The technique uses the standard FBG side writing technique [20] in a sequential\ndouble UV exposure process to fabricate PSFBGs at any required centre wavelength. Two standard\nFBGs of the same period are written such that they have a spatial overlap equivalent to a single\ngrating period. The translation stage is moved once only, in order to position the fibre for the next\nFBG which is then written when the stage is stationary. This procedure raises the local refractive\nindex of the central intersection of the two FBGs, leading to the formation of a phase shift. WDM\nPSFBGs may be fabricated over a wide spectral band, for example, fabrication in the 1300 and 1550\nnm spectral bands has been demonstrated in this work.\n2 Principle of the technique\nThe FBG fabrication system is shown in Figure 1a [20]. The phase mask is used as a beam splitter and\nmirrors 1 and 2 select the \u00b1 1 diffraction orders of the UV laser beam, redirecting them to interfere at\n4the fibre. The mirrors are mounted on rotary stages that are computer controlled to change the\nintersection angle \uf071c, which together with the translation of the fibre along the bisector of the beams\n(i.e. z axis) allows FBGs of different centre wavelengths to be fabricated. A single cylindrical lens is\nused to focus the two beams into a line aligned with the axis of the optical fibre. The fibre is clamped\nonto a computer controlled translation stage (PI, M-150.11) oriented such that the direction of\nmovement is parallel to the axis of the optical fibre. The translation stage has a maximum travel of\n50 mm, a resolution of 8 nm and is backlash free.\nThe FBG devices were fabricated using the output from a pulsed laser operating at 248 nm, with\npulse duration of 10 ns, 25 Hz repetition rate and an average power of 30 mW [20]. The FBG was\ninterrogated using a tuneable external cavity laser source (TUNICS-Plus CL) with 1 pm resolution.\nThe fabrication procedure involved three steps: firstly FBG1 was written in a photosensitive\nsinglemode (SM) fibre (Fibercore, PS1250) at a specified centre wavelength. The exposure was\nstopped when the required reflectivity was achieved. Secondly, the stage was translated along the x-\naxis under computer control through a distance equal to the length of the FBG less one grating period\n(Figure 1b). FBG2 was then fabricated at the new fibre position, without changing the fabrication\nconfiguration, until the spectral-hole that developed in the middle of the FBG reflection spectrum\nhad grown to its maximum depth and the amplitudes of the two peaks on either side of it had become\napproximately equal. The minimum fabrication time required for FBG2, leading to a fully grown\nspectral-hole, is equivalent to the time taken to write FBG1. The PSFBG produced by this procedure\nis approximately twice the length of the individual FBGs, as the spatial overlap between the FBGs is\nonly one grating period. A rectangular aperture of width 3.00 \u00b1 0.25 mm was positioned in the path\nof the UV beam from the laser to define the length of the FBGs. Diagram C in Figure 1b depicts the\nraised refractive index modulation in the intersection of the two FBGs, which leads to the required\nphase shift.\n5(a)\n(b)\nFigure 1. (a) FBG fabrication system [20] adapted to facilitate the fabrication of PSFBGs. (b)\nIllustrates the translation of the fibre and the locations of the 2 FBGs that compose the final\nPSFBG. A; FBG1 location, B; position for FBG2 fabrication, and C; PSFBG location showing the\nresulting index modulation.\n3 Results and discussion\nThe blue curve in Figure 2a shows the reflection spectrum of a 3-mm long FBG that was written into\nphotosensitive SM fibre (Fibercore, PS1250) at a centre wavelength of 1530.42 nm with a\nreflectivity of 30 %. The writing laser beam was then blocked and the stage was translated under\ncomputer control through a distance of 3 mm less one grating period (i.e. 0.528 \u00b1 0.008 \uf06dm) along\nthe x-axis (Figure 1b). A second FBG of the same centre wavelength was inscribed at the new fibre\nposition using the same fabrication conditions as before. The red curve in Figure 2a shows the\nreflection spectrum produced by the formation of the PSFBG. The PSFBG is approximately twice\nthe length of the individual FBGs (i.e. ~6 mm) and its reflectivity is 56 %. Figure 2b shows a\nreflection spectrum of the same PSFBG (52% reflectivity) which was modelled using a modified\nRouard\u2019s method [21], [22]. Figure 2 shows good qualitative agreement between the experiment and the\nmodel. The lengths of the two gratings were 3.01 \u00b1 0.01 mm and 3.00 \u00b1 0.01 mm for FBG1 and\n6FBG2, respectively, measured with a commercial Optical Backscatter Reflectometer (OBR, Luna\nTechnologies), which had a spatial resolution of 10 \uf06dm. These measurements are in close agreement\nwith the value calculated from the measured grating bandwidth (3.14 mm), peak to first zero,\nassuming a weak grating[23], and that defined by the rectangular aperture used during grating\nfabrication of 3.00 \u00b1 0.25 mm..\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 2. Reflection spectra of the 1st FBG written before the stage is translated (blue line) and\nthe PSFBG (red line): (a) experimental result, and (b) theoretical result from a modified Rouard\u2019s\nmodel [22].\nFigure 3 shows the reflection spectrum and the group delay for the PSFBG of Figure 2a measured by\nthe OBR. A constant group delay is observed across the bandwidth of the PSFBG (Figure 3), as\nexpected [23], except for a sharp peak\/step occurring at the spectral-hole wavelength (1530.42 nm).\nThis peak\/step represents a group delay, \uf044\uf074, of 0.4 ns, which corresponds to a phase shift, \uf044\uf066, of\n3.22 \u00b1 0.07 rad, calculated from equation (1) [23].\n\uf06c\uf074\n\uf06c\n\uf070\n\uf066 \uf044\uf0d7\uf044\uf0d7\uf03d\uf044 2\n2 c\n(1)\nIn equation (1), \uf044\uf06c\uf020is the wavelength step of the OBR (0.010 nm), \uf06c is 1530.42 nm and c is the free\nspace speed of light.\n7Figure 3. The reflection signal (blue line) and the group delay (red line) for the PSFBG of Figure\n2a obtained by using the OBR.\nThe linewidth exhibited by the spectral-hole of the PSFBG in Figure 2a was ~82 pm at full-width-\nhalf-maximum (FWHM) while the bandwidth of the transmission stop band was 0.504 nm which\ngives a finesse of 6.1 for this device. The finesse is comparable with that of PSFBGs fabricated using\nthe Moir\u00e9 fabrication technique [6], [8], e.g. [6] reports a finesse of ~6. The finesse can be increased\nsignificantly by fabricating PSFBGs of higher reflectivity. Table 1 shows the narrowing of the\nspectral-hole bandwidth of the PSFBG simultaneously with an increase in the finesse of the device if\na stronger (high reflectivity) PSFBG were to be fabricated. These results were obtained using a\nmodified Rouard\u2019s method, demonstrating that the fabrication technique presented here is capable of\nproducing high finesse if required. Table 1 also shows that while the bandwidth of the PSFBG\nspectral-hole can be narrowed by increasing the length of the device this procedure will not change\nthe finesse.\nTable 1.

An 8mm-\nlong PSFBG fabricated by the new technique will have a linewidth of 16 pm and finesse of 29 if\nfabricated with the same reflectivity of 97 %, as analysed by the modified Rouard\u2019s method. The\nquality of the PSFBGs fabricated by the new technique is therefore comparable to that of PSFBGs\nproduced by the phase-mask technique when fabricated with high reflectivity.\nThe influence of errors in the positioning of the fibre before the fabrication of the 2nd FBG was\nanalysed using the modified Rouard\u2019s method. The model shows that, when the stage moves short of\nthe intended distance, the spectral-hole of the PSFBG red-shifts in wavelength, while the opposite is\ntrue when the stage moves by more than the intended distance (Figure 4). This result shows that the\nfabrication method does not impose stringent accuracy to the translation of the stage, for example, an\nerror of 8 nm in the stage position leads to a shift of 4 pm in the spectral hole wavelength while a\n104 nm stage position error causes a shift of 60 pm. The line in Figure 4b represents the best fit to\nthe modelled data points (3rd order polynomial). The transfer function can be used to determine the\nwavelength location of the spectral hole, prior to PSFBG fabrication, for a given translation stage\nerror.\n9(a)\n(b)\nFigure 4. The influence of the stage translation error on the position of the spectral hole; (a) the\nspectral-hole red-shifts (dotted lines) by 60 pm when the translation stage travels 104 nm (i.e. 13\nx stage resolution) short of the required distance, and (b) the shift in normalised wavelength of\nthe spectral-hole as a function of the translation stage error. The line represents a 3rd order\npolynomial fit to the calculated data points.\nThe repeatability of the fabrication technique was investigated by writing four separate PSFBGs\nwithout altering the configuration. The spectral-hole wavelength was reproduced to within 6 pm,\nindicating repeatable and reproducible spectra, consistent with the theoretical model and the\ntranslation stage resolution. To demonstrate the flexibility of the technique, PSFBGs were written in\nthe 1550 nm [24] and 1300 nm [25] wavelength bands (Figure 5). To achieve this, the angle \uf071c together\nwith the position of the translation stage along the z-axis in Figure 1, were readjusted. The spectra of\nthe PSFBGs, shown in Figures 5a and 5b, have centre wavelengths of 1547.25 nm and 1566.85 nm,\nrespectively, and corresponding reflectivities of 58 % and 63 %, respectively. These PSFBGs were\ninterrogated using a tuneable external cavity laser source (TUNICS-Plus CL) with 1 pm resolution.\nA swept laser source (Santec Europe Ltd), with a scan range of 49 nm centred at 1287 nm and with a\nscan rate of 2.5 kHz, was used to interrogate the PSFBGs written in the 1300 nm wavelength band\nand the spectra are shown in Figures 5c and 5d. The centre wavelengths of the PSFBGs are 1283.33\nnm and 1286.65 nm, respectively, measured with a resolution of 2 pm and the corresponding\nreflectivities are 61 % and 63 %, respectively. The spectra are slightly noisy due to the small jitter in\nthe trigger signal of the swept laser system. Four PSFBGs fabricated by this technique, with\n10\nwavelength separations of 3 nm from 1283 nm to 1292 nm, were embedded in an aircraft wing and\nsubsequently used for aerodynamic pressure sensing [25]. This demonstrated the suitability of this\nfabrication system for WDM PSFBGs for sensing applications.\n(a) (b)\n(c)\n(d)\nFigure 5. The reflection spectra of PSFBGs fabricated at different centre wavelengths using the\nconfiguration of Figure 1. (a) and (b) lie in the 1550 nm wavelength band, and (c) and (d) lie in the\n1300 nm wavelength band.\nThe properties of previously reported techniques are compared with the current technique in Table 2.\n11\nTable 2.

The characteristics of the PSFBGs fabricated compared closely with a model\nbased on a modified Rouard\u2019s method. The model demonstrates that the strength\/reflectivity of the\nPSFBG influences the spectral-hole linewidth as well as the finesse of the device while the length of\nthe PSFBG affects only the linewidth of the spectral-hole but not the finesse of the device. This\nmodel was also used to investigate the wavelength shift of the spectral hole as a function of\ntranslation stage errors which was found to be ~0.6pm\/nm. PSFBGs were fabricated in the 1300 nm\nand 1550 nm wavelength bandwidths to demonstrate the flexibility of the technique in the choice of\nthe grating centre wavelength. The PSFBG devices are useful for optical sensing, and have been\nused for example, for high resolution transverse load measurements[4], [25] .\n5 Acknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank Matthew Ball of Lambda Photometrics UK for the loan of the Luna\nOBR.
