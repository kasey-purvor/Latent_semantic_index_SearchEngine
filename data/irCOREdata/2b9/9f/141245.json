Food production is essential to life. Modern farming uses considerable resources to\nproduce arable crops. Analysing the environmental burdens of alternative crop production methods is a vital tool for\npolicymakers. The paper describes systematic procedures to calculate the production burdens of three key arable crops:\nbread wheat, oilseed rape and potatoes as grown in England and Wales using future alternative non-organic and organic\nsystems. Resource use (e.g. abiotic and energy) and burdens from emissions are included (e.g. global warming potential on\na 100 year basis, GWP, and eutrophication and acidification potentials).\nMethods. Crop production was analysed, using systems models, so that the effects of factors like changing cultivations, N\nfertiliser application rates or irrigation could be examined using a life cycle analysis approach. Emissions of nitrate were\nderived from a simulation model in which soil organic N was driven to steady state so that all long term effects were\nproperly accounted for. Yield response curves to N were similarly derived from long-term experiments. Crop nutrient\ninputs and plant protection applications were derived from national survey data and the literature. All major inputs were\naccounted for including fertiliser extraction, manufacture and delivery; pesticide manufacture; field fuel use; machinery\nand building manufacture; crop drying, cooling and storage. The current balance of production systems were found from\nsurvey data. The weighted mean national production was calculated from a combination of three rainfall levels and soil\ntextures. The system boundary is the farm gate. The functional unit is 1 t marketable fresh weight of each product.\nResults and Discussion. The current primary energy needs for producing the three main products were 2.4, 4.9 and 1.4\nGJ\/t for bread wheat, oilseed rape and potatoes respectively. When expressed in terms of dry matter, protein or energy,\nwheat incurred smaller burdens than oilseed rape, which incurred lower burdens than potatoes. The crops do, of course, all\nplay different roles. The results are generally of the same order as those from other European studies. With the organic\nsystem of production, bread wheat needed about 80% of the energy, while potatoes needed 13% more energy because the\nlower fertiliser use (and hence energy use) is offset by more energy for fieldwork and lower yields and maincrop potato\nenergy is dominated by cold storage. While pesticide use was always lower in organic production, other burdens were\ngenerally inconsistently higher or lower. and land occupation was always higher. With reduced N application production\nsystems, bread wheat energy use and GWP are reduced, but also the proportion of the wheat achieving bread-quality is\nreduced. The optimum for energy is with N at about 70% of the current level. The optimum seems to be lower for GWP,\nbut the sub-models used are beyond there range of reliability.\nConclusions. Arable crop production depends heavily on fossil fuel in current major production systems. The emissions\ncausing GWP are very dependent on nitrous oxide, more so than fuel consumption. That, together with emissions of\nammonia and nitrate, means that agriculture has a C-N footprint rather than the C footprint that typifies most industrial life.\nThe reductions in burdens from alternative systems of production are less than their proponents suggest.\nRecommendations and Perspectives. With the large influence of nitrous oxide on GWP, evaluation of nitrous oxide\nemissions by another method, e.g. crop-soil simulation modelling instead of the more rigid IPCC method would improve\nthe robustness of the analysis. System modelling allows alternative production methods to be readily and properly explored\nand this greatly enhances LCA methodology.\nKeywords: Arable; agriculture; system; simulation model; organic; GWP; nitrate; energy, nitrous oxide, environmental\nimpact.\n1 Introduction\nA study of arable crop production in England and Wales was conducted as part of the government\u2019s programme on\nsustainability. It was conducted for the benefit of policymakers and stakeholders so that alternative production scenarios\ncould be systematically examined such as: increasing the proportion of organic production, different tillage methods,\nreducing fertiliser application rates. This paper covers the major commodities of bread wheat, potatoes and oilseed rape\nand uses standard life cycle analysis (LCA) together with system modelling. Results are presented at the national level.\nOther research has investigated crop production in Europe using LCA. Audsley et al. [1] used pan-European data in a\nstudy aimed at harmonising agricultural LCA methods and wheat was a case study. Cederberg [2] included wheat, maize\nand soya as feeds. Charles et al. (2006) studied wheat grown with different intensities of production [3]. Van der Werf [4]\nanalysed wheat, barley, soya, maize, sunflower & more in a study of pig feed. Rape has been studied mainly with the\nperspective of the oil for use as a biofuel. Maize production has been analysed both as part of wider studies on animal feed\nin Europe [2,3] and as a bio-energy crop in the USA.\nPrevious studies have used specific data to study alternative systems. This limits the analysis to these systems. In this\npaper we adopt a different approach using system models. In the first instance national production is a combination of\nproportions of distinct systems \u2013 thus ploughing, minimum tillage, direct drilling \u2013 which can be altered. Secondly,\nsystems models are used to properly represent responses to changes \u2013 thus level of nitrogen, irrigation or increased yield\ndue to the breeding of new varieties of a crop. In this way new scenarios can be defined on continuous scales of change\nfrom the present.\nThe goals of the study were to calculate the environmental burdens of producing the commodities bread wheat, potatoes\nand oilseed rape in England and Wales at a national level, comparing current and future alternative production methods\nsystematically.\nZ:\\Reducing_Environmental_Burdens-2010.doc Page 3 of 16 Last printed 03\/10\/2011 15:20:00\n2 Methods\n2.1 Functional units\n2.2 The functional unit is 1 t of fresh weight of each product, standardised to 86% dry matter (dm) for wheat,\n92.5% for rape and 20% for potatoes. Bread wheat produced non-organically contained 13.5% crude\nprotein (CP), but organic bread wheat cannot achieve that level and wheat for bread is accepted at 12.5%\nCP. Potatoes are grown in three main types: maincrop, 1st earlies and 2nd earlies, so that the commodity is\ndefined as a basket of each type scaled by national proportions. System boundary\nThe system boundary is the farm gate, but all crop storage, cooling and drying prior to sale are included within the virtual\nfarm gate (for example central grain storage facilities, but not processor\u2019s storage). Soil processes were included to a depth\nof 0.3 m.\n2.3 Long term approach\nThe concept is to analyse the effect if all (or a substantial proportion of) farms in the UK replace their current systems of\nproduction and adopt new systems for the foreseeable future \u2013 for example 80% of optimum fertiliser or organic farming.\nIn order to follow properly the fate of atoms into and out of the system boundary, a long term approach is needed in the\nanalysis. Thus the output of N as emissions of ammonia, nitrate, nitrous oxide and as protein in crops, must be balanced by\nthe input of N from the atmosphere, by nitrogen fixing, in manure organic matter and in fertiliser as ammonium, nitrate or\nurea, A build-up or depletion of nutrients in the soil is not permitted and offtake must be sustained by the long term nutrient\nsupply. Every crop must bear the burden of supplying the nutrient it removes. Long-term also implies that the transition\nfrom one production system to another is not included, e.g. non-organic to organic conversion and the change in soil carbon\nstatus. In both organic and non-organic crop production, rotations, tillage and spray use were defined that would achieve\ntechnically sustainable yields. The arbitrary removal of, for example, a spray application or weed control cultivation step\nmight incur no yield loss in one year, but would progressively lead to long-term yield loss.\n2.4 National context\nCrop production was represented at a national scale by considering a combination of nine soil texture and rainfalls: clay,\nloam and sand; 587, 675 and 776 mm. The national distributions were established by Williams et al. [4] to provide\nweighted average national production, including allowances for favoured soil types for particular crops.\n2.5 Crop rotations\nCrops are grown in a variety of rotations, while this project aimed to determine the burdens of producing specific\ncommodities. The growth of the crops was analysed in the context of representative rotations, implying that the crop\nreceives some benefits such as reduced disease incidence and rotational plant nutrient transfers. No change in rotation was\nanalysed.\n2.6 Crop production methods\nThe same approach was use to model all the crops, with differences in the detail. The full model can be downloaded from\nwww.agrilca.com which allows access to all the details. The main sources of agricultural burdens for field crop production\nare: diesel for cultivation, chemical and fertiliser applications, irrigation and harvesting; drying and cooling crops;\nproduction of fertilisers, pesticides and machinery; construction and maintenance of buildings for crops and machinery;\ndirect soil-crop emissions to air and water (like nitrate, nitrous oxide and ammonia) and land occupation. All except land\noccupation involve energy and abiotic resource use and involve some gaseous and aquatic emissions. Organic or non-\norganic production systems have significant differences and are analysed separately. The sum of non-organic methods\nrepresents contemporary conventional production. Full details are given in Williams et al. [6] and the main points are\npresented here.\nIn analysing the separate impacts of the integrated systems of livestock and arable production (conventional or organic), it\nis necessary to define appropriate system boundaries so that burdens of production are appropriately allocated. Feed and\nstraw can be considered as co-products of arable and hence as inputs to livestock. Manure can similarly be considered as a\n(waste) product of livestock and as an input which displaces the need for fertiliser production in arable (with the burden of\nstorage and spreading allocated to livestock). This definition is system independent.\nThis definition means that in analysing arable production it is not necessary to consider manure (or livestock), since its\nburden in the arable system is that of producing fertiliser and it is thus replaced by the equivalent fertiliser it provides. In\nthe same way, in organic arable production, fertiliser input is by growing clover crops in a rotation (colloquially known as\nstockless organic). With livestock, the manure displaces the need for crops and thus receives a credit in terms of land\noccupied (rather than the MJ energy for fertiliser production credit for manure in non-organic systems). Thus if the system\nwas expanded to a mixed farm consisting of a number of arable crops and livestock, the sum of the individual burdens\nwould provide the correct burdens for the farm.\n3 Data\n3.1 Field operations\nAll arable crops require: seed bed establishment; crop protection (weeds and diseases); fertilisation; irrigation (potatoes\nonly), harvesting and crop storage drying and\/or cooling.\nZ:\\Reducing_Environmental_Burdens-2010.doc Page 4 of 16 Last printed 03\/10\/2011 15:20:00\n3.1.1 Seed bed establishment\nMethods of soil cultivation were divided into three methods, namely plough-based, reduced cultivation and direct drilling.\nThe number of passes of secondary cultivation operations depends on soil texture [7] and greater energy is needed for\ntillage of heavier soils [9]. The operations used in contemporary farming were derived from the Silsoe Whole Farm Model\n[8-10] and from details from a commercial farming group. Data on fuel used came from 13 sources (reviewed by Williams\net al., 2006). These were linked with data on tractor and field machinery weights, work rates and life spans to derive\noverall primary energy requirements (and associated burdens) for field operations using the method of Audsley et al. [1].\nPrimary energy ranged from 470 MJ\/ha for direct drilling on sandy soils to 5210 MJ\/ha for ploughing on clay. Potatoes\nrequire deeper ploughing (25% extra energy) and only plough based tillage is used. This and the extra operations needed,\nincreases the total energy for establishing potatoes on loam by 84%. In organic crops, ploughing is the norm, because\nreduced tillage and direct drilling require pesticides. However some crops in organic rotations are undersown.\n3.1.2 Crop protection\nPlant protection involves both rotations and some chemical applications. The numbers of passes with a sprayer and\nnumbers of doses per crop were obtained from the Pesticide Usage Surveys [11]. Additional light cultivations for weed\ncontrol are used in organic crops for weed and disease control. Potato blight control, using copper based products, is\npermitted in a derogation, otherwise pesticides are not used in organic crop production.\n3.1.3 Fertiliser application and harvesting\nSynthetic and mineral fertilisers are applied using relatively little energy (110 MJ\/ha). If cereal straw is not being baled,\nthen the combine harvester will also chop the straw (using more energy for this). The burdens of baling and carting straw\nare allocated to the straw, if harvested. Combine harvesting (with straw chopping) takes 1130 MJ\/ha while potato\nharvesting needs 3140 MJ\/ha.\n3.1.4 Crop Storage, cooling and drying\nAll crop storage is considered to take place within the farm gate, even though in practice some takes place physically\nelsewhere. The energy for constructing, maintaining and demolishing a grain store were estimated using the method of\nAudsley et al. [11], but with their data supplemented by local expert opinion, using a typical mean storage requirement of\n0.4 m2 t-1 (Table 2).\nIn the UK, grain is often dried after harvest. Wheat is dried to 86% dry matter (DM) and rape to 92.5% DM. During the\nharvest period the harvested grain DM varies with weather conditions. In good years, no grain needs drying. Data on long\nterm harvested wheat grain DM came from Rothamsted\u2019s Broadbalk dataset for 1971 to 2001. These were used to\ncalculate the energy needed for grain drying. The mean specific energy requirement for evaporating water in representative\ngrain driers was estimated to be 4.7 MJ\/kg water [12-13]. The drying requirements for other crops were calculated by\nrelating their equilibrium moisture curves [14] to that of wheat so that the same distribution data from Broadbalk could be\nused as a proxy for DM at harvesting.\nThe results show that the energy needed for drying wheat from 1991 to 2001 was only 45% of that from 1971 to 2001,\nperhaps reflecting climate change or changed managerial practices resulting from higher fuel prices. Results from these 10\nyears were thus used (Table 2). Some crops are cooled by ventilating with ambient air and average values were derived\nfrom data in McLean [12] and Scotford et al. [15]. It was assumed that 1\/12 of grain was sold direct from combine\nharvesters for immediate use and thus did not need storeing cooling or drying.\n3.1.4.1 Potato storage\nEarlies are harvested and sold directly. Maincrop potatoes may be stored for over a year [16]. The market price for\nmaincrop potatoes falls in the spring and most are removed from stores by May, but some are stored for processing and\ncatering through to next harvest. Most potatoes are stored in temperature controlled environments using ambient\nventilation or refrigeration, while a small proportion is stored in clamps [17].\nThe energy needed to cool potatoes was estimated using a model of the expected rates of emptying of stores and the\nspecific energy needs of store types [17-20]. Data suggests that 10% of organic maincrop is sold directly (e.g. vegetable\nboxes). This would not remain valid if organic became the main production system rather than its current niche. Cooling\nenergy was thus scaled in proportion to the level of organic production so that the energy demands for all production\norganic and all production non-organic approach each other. This avoids the possibility of extrapolating a system that is\ncurrently a niche into a distribution system that operates in a different way.\n3.2 Production of inputs\n3.2.1 Pesticide manufacturing energy\nThe manufacturing energy for pesticides was derived from Audsley et al. [1] (which assign values for different types of\npesticide (and growth regulators) and Garthwaite et al. [11]. The mean primary energy requirement for wheat, rape and\npotatoes were 144, 121 and 220 MJ\/dose-ha respectively.\n3.2.2 Fertiliser manufacturing\nThe four main plant nutrients (N, P, K and S) and soil pH adjustment through lime were included in the analysis. There are\nsystematic differences between non-organic and organic methods. Organic nitrogen is derived directly (or indirectly as\nmanure or compost) from nitrogen fixation by legumes. Non-organic N is mainly obtained from ammonia-derived\nmaterials using the Bosch-Haber process in which natural gas is used both as an energy source and feedstock. Both\nsystems receive atmospheric deposition of N. In organic systems, P, K ad lime must be from sources such as rocks with a\nminimum of physical processing. We assumed lower rates of soil availability of the nutrients per tonne applied..\nZ:\\Reducing_Environmental_Burdens-2010.doc Page 5 of 16 Last printed 03\/10\/2011 15:20:00\nThe burdens for producing, packing and delivering fertilisers (Table 4) were derived from 20 sources that were reviewed by\nWilliams et al. [6]. The main burdens relate to energy use (e.g. for converting N2 to NH3 or quarrying and transporting\nminerals). A specific extra term is applied for N2O emission from nitric acid production, which is used for nitrate based\nfertilisers.\n3.2.3 Nitrogen supply in organic systems\nA representative stockless organic rotation consists of two years of a fertility building clover crop, followed by wheat or\npotatoes, spring barley, winter beans, and spring oats. Forage rye is planted as a cover before the spring crops. If only one\nyear of clover was grown, subsequent yields would be reduced owing to the lower N supply. Although land occupation\nwould superficially fall (i.e. less land needed for fertility building) a lower N supply would reduce yields and could\nactually increase the land needed per t of crop. The additional burdens consist of additional ploughing and maintenance\noperations and land occupation including land for seed production. Overall the additional ploughing required per cash crop\nis a factor of 1.25 times the non-organic crop and the additional land required is a factor of 1.525. However the additional\nrequirement should be applied per the nitrogen requirement of the cash crops.\nIt is estimated from data [21] that organic farms import compost annually into arable soils at a rate of 1.4 t\/ha. The burdens\nof composting have two main sources: energy for collection and turning, and gases emitted during composting. A\nsimplifying assumption was that no leaching takes place from compost heaps, and all N losses are gaseous. Energy and\nemissions were estimated (Table 5) using data from 15 sources as reviewed by Williams et al. [6]. However it is possible\nthat if there were zero organic farms this compost would be applied to non-organic farms.\n3.3 Use of inputs\n3.3.1 P, K and S supply\nFarmers supply P and K to maintain a particular soil status over time, but not necessarily to the specific crop. The model\nassumes that P, K and S are supplied equal to the offtake in the crop (and any losses to the environment). However,\nfarmers add P to potatoes in excess of plant offtake because the crop needs (responds to) a higher level in the soil. The\nburden of this P production is born by potatoes and the surplus is allocated to other crops grown in such rotations in\nproportion to the national areas and yields. Atmospheric deposition of S was accounted for.\n3.3.2 N supply\nShort-term fertiliser experiments are confounded by previous cropping and fertiliser use so that low inputs reduce the\nfertiliser status of the soil and the yields achieved are not sustainable. Therefore the effects of fertiliser nitrogen on wheat\nyield (and protein content) were modelled using data from Rothamsted\u2019s long-term Broadbalk plots, where the fertiliser\ntreatments have been applied for many years, so that true long term effects can be seen. N application rates range from 0 to\n288 kg N\/ha. The increase in the grain yield (Y) in response to applied N was well characterised by a linear-exponential\ncurve: dNcNbaY \uf02d\uf02d\uf02d\uf03d )exp( . The nitrogen offtake in grain is characterised by a logistic growth curve:\n)))(exp(1\/( dNcbaY \uf02d\uf02d\uf02b\uf02b\uf03d . The same forms of equation applied to straw (Table 6). Using the expressions, yields and\nofftake change mechanistically in response to changes in N.\nThe Broadbalk data were for one type of feed wheat on one specific soil. Further adjustments were made to allow for\ndifferences between bread and feed wheat protein concentrations using NIAB (www.niab.com) variety data and for the\neffect of soil type on yield. Bread varieties typically yield 5 to 10% less than feed varieties, but contain more protein.\nOrganic farmers (with lower soil nitrogen supply) need to choose the highest protein varieties to be able to achieve over\n12% crude protein with any reliability and often grow spring wheat, which has a higher protein concentration, but is even\nlower yielding. Yield responses to soil texture were made using coefficients derived by Audsley [8]. Analogous\nrelationships were derived for potatoes and rape (Table 6). The N supplies for crops grown organically were inferred from\nthose needed to obtain the same yield non-organically.\n3.3.3 Potato irrigation\nPotatoes are often irrigated, with the amount depending on the weather and soil type. Weatherhead et al. [22] showed that\nirrigation increased yield by 25% for maincrop potatoes. Maincrop potatoes use more irrigation than first earlies, which\nmay be harvested before the summer soil water deficit sets in. A relationship for yield in terms of proportion of the area\nirrigated was derived from Weatherhead et al. [22] and Weatherhead and Danert [23]. The yield at any level of irrigation,\n\u03bc, is: \n)1)1((\n)1)1(()(\n100\n100\n\uf02b\uf02d\n\uf02b\uf02d\n\uf03d\nm\nmYY\n\uf06d\uf067\n\uf06d\uf067\n\uf06d\n\u03bcm.is the current level of irrigation,Ym is the yield at the current level of irrigation (\u03b3100). . Parameter values and yield\nresponses are given in Table 7. Long term yield data were obtained from government statistics [16], being 19.1 t\/ha for\nearlies and 43.5 t\/ha for maincrop. It was assumed that organic potato production uses 10% of the irrigation as non-organic\nas organic farmers try minimise any inputs.\n3.4 Yield penalties\n3.4.1 Sub-soiling\nSub-soiling is deep cultivation with narrow tines, used to break plough pans or to loosen compacted soils. It was assumed\nthat if sub-soiling is too infrequent on some soils (one third of all), there is a yield loss. This happens when the interval (i)\nexceeds i0 years. Below this interval, there is no yield loss or gain. Maximum yield loss was assumed to be 10%, with\ni0 = 3 years.\nZ:\\Reducing_Environmental_Burdens-2010.doc Page 6 of 16 Last printed 03\/10\/2011 15:20:00\n3.4.2 Reduced tillage and direct drilling\nThere is controversy about the long term yields of crops grown without ploughing. Build up of some weeds such as\nblackgrass has been suggested as being detrimental, and may cause a move back to ploughing (maybe temporary), although\nRobertson et al. [24] found enhanced yields of wheat with direct drilling. It was decided to assume that long term yields\nreductions of 2% and 4% applied to crops grown with reduced tillage and direct drilling respectively, and with increased\nuse of chemicals for weed control.\n3.4.3 Marketable crop yield\nNot all wheat intended for breadmaking achieves the quality required. HGCA [25] reported a survey of the crude protein\n(CP) concentrations in grain after harvest. For example, for the variety Hereward, the cumulative distribution of CP\nconcentration was 1% at <11.3% CP, 21% at <13.5% CP, 71% at <15.5% CP (with 6% at >15.5% CP), suggesting a\nnormal distribution. Both the Hereward and Rothamsted\u2019s Broadbalk data suggest a standard deviation of about 1% in\nprotein concentration. Organic breadmaking wheat varieties show a standard deviation of 0.66% protein, with a mean of\n12.5%. A standard deviation of 0.6% was thus used to calculate the proportion of the national crop that met the\nbreadmaking protein criteria. Wheat can also fail to meet bread making quality by having a poor Hagberg Index or specific\nweight, due to growing conditions rather than N input. This is typically 4.4% of national yield and this also becomes feed\n(or non-bread milling) wheat. The burdens were allocated between the bread and feed fractions according to their\neconomic value.\nPotatoes may be not suitable for human food due to size, quality and damage. The typical non-organic loss rate is 15%.\nLoss was divided equally into stock-feed (12% burdens of human edible crop) and those returned to land (mostly via\ncomposting). The typical loss rate of organic potatoes (mainly from slug damage) is 30% [26-27] and can range as high as\n50% [28].\n3.5 Emissions to the environment\n3.5.1 Emissions of N\nThe effects of soil and rainfall on leaching (nitrate to water) and denitrification (nitrogen as N2 and N2O to air) were\nestablished using the SUNDIAL simulation program from Rothamsted Research [29]. This simulates the nitrogen in the\nsoil from year to year with N inputs from atmospheric deposition, fertiliser, fixing, seeds, returned roots, straw and haulm\nand N outputs to primary crop offtake (grain, tubers), secondary crop offtake (straw), returned offtake (roots, straw and\nhaulm), leached nitrate-N, denitrified-N and N from senescing plants. A range of non-organic and organic rotations were\ndefined that contained representative crops. Each rotation was simulated for nine combinations of soil type and rainfall\n(clay, loam and sandy soil with rainfall at 587, 675 and 776 mm) and with and without straw incorporation. Simulations\nwere run for long enough to ensure that the simulated rotations were in steady state, as indicated by the soil organic N\n(SON) fraction being the same at the start and end of a rotation.\nYields, which are an input to SUNDIAL, were taken from national averages or standard texts, scaled according soil type\nusing relationships previously developed by Audsley [8]. Organic crop yields for these simulations were taken from\nLampkin et al. [26] and varied according to soil type.\nFertiliser inputs for non-organic production were established from RB209 [30] and use of the SUNDIAL (in the Fertiliser\nRecommendation System version). Individual crops were also simulated with N inputs increased or decreased by 20%\nfrom these standard values. For organically grown crops, the initial assumption was made that the yields should provide\nsufficient N and not deplete soil reserves, using fixed N from the clover ley (with beans in the 5th year). Preliminary runs\nassessed how well the rotation performed and most crops could achieve their target yields, except for the final crop, which\nonly yielded 3.0 t\/ha, rather than the 3.8 t\/ha that was forecast. The N fixed was calculated by SUNDIAL as 300 kg\/ha\nover the two years of clover, with more fixed in the second year than first year. This was based on standard values from the\nliterature, and agreed as a possible value with the Elm Farm Research Centre.\nAnalysing the results, in the non-organic simulations the N leached at a rotational level was linearly related to the whole-\nrotation N-surplus (input as fertiliser or fixed minus offtake). Allocations were derived for the individual crops within each\nrotation on the basis of the proportion of the surplus due to each crop. The results were combined to generate linear\nrelationships for each crop from which denitrification and leaching could be reliably calculated for each soil-rain\ncombination from the N surplus for that crop. These coefficients were used in conjunction with crop husbandry data to\npredict denitrification, leaching and senescence for any given input of N. For field beans, it was concluded that\ndenitrification and leaching losses were a constant for each combination of soil and rainfall.\nExactly the same methods could not be used with organic rotations, because there was not a simple surplus that could be\ncalculated for each crop (most N being fixed at the start of the rotation by clover). Values for the offtake and N losses of\nfield beans were taken from the non-organic rotations. The sum of all other losses from a rotation was then allocated to the\nremaining cash crops in proportion to the useful N offtake of each crop for each combination of rainfall and soil texture.\nLosses from senescence are generally low (about 2 kg N ha-1) and were assumed to be an equal mixture of NH3-N and N2N.\n3.5.2 Denitrification to nitrous oxide (N2O) using the IPCC methodology.\nSUNDIAL calculates total denitrification, but the major species of concern in global warming is N2O. The\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC 1997 method and emission factors, as reported in the UK greenhouse\ngas inventory [31] was adopted for land based emissions. This assumes that all direct inputs of N into soil are associated\nwith an emission of N2O and each is associated with an emission factor. Direct inputs include: synthetic fertiliser; N fixed\nby legumes; ploughed-in crop residues; land spreading of animal manures, compost or sewage sludge and direct deposition\nof manures by grazing animals. Indirect emissions arise from atmospheric deposition of N and leached nitrate.\nZ:\\Reducing_Environmental_Burdens-2010.doc Page 7 of 16 Last printed 03\/10\/2011 15:20:00\n3.5.3 Methane oxidation by soil\nA credit arises to agricultural land from methane oxidation by methanotrophic soil bacteria. A value of 0.65 kg CH4 ha-1\nyear-1 for all non-organic land was established after an extensive examination of 24 papers literature reviewed by Williams\net al. [6]. This was arbitrarily increased by 25% for organic land on the basis that N fertiliser is not used and some work\nhas shown inhibition of methane oxidation from this. The field evidence for more methane oxidation in organic soil was\nnot, however, found in the literature. The extra land occupied for grass-clover leys in organic arable crop production is also\ncredited with methane oxidation capacity.\n3.5.4 P and K losses\nLosses of P and K by diffuse pollution (and erosion) from non-organic fields were set at 1.5 and 2 kg ha-1 respectively.\nThese were reduced by 50% for organic fields in which a lower P and K status was assumed. P and K offtakes were\nderived from crop yields (including straw) and the nutrient concentrations [32].\n3.6 Allocation of burdens between grain and straw\nGrain is harvested by a combine harvester, but straw may be harvested or incorporated. If harvested, additional burdens are\nincurred by the straw baler, but the actual harvest energy is reduced slightly as a straw chopper is not required. Thus one\ncan calculate the burden attributable to the grain.\nThe total burdens of producing grain and straw are: DBpIpHT ss \uf02b\uf02b\uf02d\uf02b\uf03d )1(\nThen the burden allocated to grain is: DYpvYYIHG sssgg \uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf03d ))\/(()(\n* ,\nand the burden allocated to straw is: )(\n)(\n)()(* IBp\nYpvY\nYpvIHS s\nsssg\nsss \uf02d\uf02b\n\uf02b\n\uf02b\n\uf03d ,\nwhere H is the vector of burdens of producing grain up to the end of combine harvesting per ha, I is the vector of burdens\nof chopping for incorporation for all straw produced, D is the vector of burdens of drying and storage of grain, B is the\nvector of straw baling burdens for all straw produced, ps is the proportion of straw baled and harvested, Yg is the net yield\nof grain per ha at standard DM content, Ys is the yield of straw per ha (whether harvested or not) at standard DM content,\nand vs is the relative value of the straw prior to baling versus the grain, typically 0.05.\n3.7 Impact assessments\nThe impact assessment factors were taken from the Institute of Environmental Sciences of Leiden University (CML) found\nat (http:\/\/www.leidenuniv.nl\/interfac\/cml\/ssp\/index.html). The CML 1999 problem oriented approach baseline factors\nwere used for eutrophication and acidification (not including fate) and abiotic resource use together with the IPCC 1997\nfactors for global warming potential. Land occupation was calculated explicitly from yield data.\n4 Results\nThe gross fresh weight yields of the crops analysed are shown in Table 8 together with the proportions of each crop\ncurrently grown organically.\nThe results (FW basis) combine the current proportions of non-organic and organic farming and cultivation systems (Table\n9). When compared on a DM basis, wheat captures about twice the DM per unit energy of the other crops (Table 10).\nWheat is still about 25% more energy efficient in capturing protein than rape, but three times more efficient than potatoes.\nA similar trend holds for digestible energy (for pigs) of the whole crops (Table 10). Of course, the three crops fulfil very\ndifferent functions and rape provides oil (for human food or bio-diesel) as well as a meal for animal feed. Once oil has\nbeen extracted from rapeseed, the protein in rapeseed meal incurs about the energy of that in wheat.\n4.1.1 Bread wheat\nThe contrasts between non-organic and organic arable crop production are well illustrated by bread wheat (Table 11).\nOrganic production uses about 20% less energy per tonne of product than non-organic, while occupying about three times\nthe land area (including fertility building and cover crops). Although emissions per ha are sometimes lower from organic,\nyields are about halved and nitrogen fixing crops are needed, thus burdens in many cases are little changed. Fertiliser\nproduction, cultivations and harvesting are the main energy consumers, with fertiliser production dominating non-organic\nproduction (53%) and field work dominating organic production (60%). Field operations represents about a quarter of the\ntotal energy input to non-organic wheat, with equipment manufacture representing about one third of that energy input.\nOrganic cultivations use more energy per ha than non-organic as direct drilling or reduced tillage are not used. This,\ntogether with lower yields and no artificial N fertiliser are why the proportion of energy used in field operations is so much\nhigher. Organic wheat is produced without any pesticides.\nCompared with combustion based industries, fossil fuel use is a minor contributor to global warming potential (GWP, on a\n100 year basis) in arable agriculture. The main contributor (80%) is the N2O-N emissions because they are 400 times more\npotent than CO2 (mass basis). Nitrous oxide is emitted as a by-product of the nitrogen cycle in the soil as nitrogen is\ntransformed between organic matter, ammonia and nitrate. The IPCC 1997 method estimates 1.25% of most soil N fluxes\nare emitted as N2O-N. This emission is irrespective of whether the N source is as synthetic N or from N fixing, thus the\nproportions of N2O emitted are closely related to the crop N supply and are not intrinsically different between organic and\nnon-organic production. Arable methane emissions in the UK are trivial compared with those from animals, especially\nruminants.\nScenarios\nScenarios of bread wheat production were investigated (Table 12). Because non-organic represents 99% of production,\nmost of the following applies only to non-organic production.\nZ:\\Reducing_Environmental_Burdens-2010.doc Page 8 of 16 Last printed 03\/10\/2011 15:20:00\nCurrently 20% of the fertiliser-N applied to bread wheat is urea. Increasing this to 100%, results in diverse effects.\nPrimary energy (PE) remains effectively constant, but GWP falls by 21%, mainly because of the absence of the specific\nemission of N2O associated with nitrate production. Eutrophication potential (EP) increases by 11%, but there is a 2.5 fold\nincrease in acidification potential resulting from the large field ammonia emissions. Although urea has a lower specific\nenergy requirement than ammonium nitrate, more has to be applied to maintain the same N supply as ammonium nitrate\nowing to the large field losses. So, potential gains in reducing PE are cancelled out by higher application rates.\nIf ploughing was reduced from the current 57% to 0 and replaced by 50% reduced cultivation and 50% direct drilling, PE\nuse falls by 5%. Most other effects are small, but pesticide use is increased by 15% as herbicides are essential features of\nthese lower energy tillage methods.\nIf plant breeding provides varieties with 1% more protein, the N supply to the crop must be increased, resulting in increases\nof all major burdens by about 4%. A greater proportion of domestic wheat could, however, be used for breadmaking, so\nreplacing the need for imports. Importing grain from North America increases PE and GWP by about 28% and 14%\nrespectively. The model assumes the same nitrogen utilisation efficiency for current and improved varieties.\nBreeding new varieties with 20% higher yield, but with the same protein concentration, causes a reduction in all burdens\n(e.g. PE, GWP and acidification by 8-9% and eutrophication and potential land occupation by 17%). This happens even\nthough 14% more N fertiliser is used. It should be noted that, there is normally a negative correlation between increased\nyield and increased protein in wheat breeds.\nGrowing wheat on heavier soils increases yields and despite requiring more energy for tillage, burdens are reduced (by a\nmean of 5%) as the proportion of clay soils used doubled.\nIf straw is baled rather than being incorporated, it incurs extra burdens for field operations and exported plant nutrients in\nstraw. As straw is a co-product of grain, some of the burdens of grain production are passed to the straw. The effect is a\nlinear decrease in the burdens of grain production (mean of 4%) as the proportion of straw baled increases (from 0 to\n100%), reflecting the overall increase in useful produce exported from the field. The effect is similar for both organic and\nnon-organic crops.\nThe effects of changing the N fertiliser rate are non-linear, reflecting at least partly the linear-exponential yield curve and\nthe effects on protein concentration (Figure 1). The PE needed for bread wheat reaches a minimum at about 75% of the\ncurrent rate. Other burdens show similar trends with different minima, but this is the most reliable value because the sub-\nmodels used to estimate leaching and total denitrification have been stretched beyond their original domain and the results\nbecome less reliable. The yield curve is well within a reliable range. Land occupation increases since both yield and\nprotein concentration fall with less N. At 75% N rate, land occupation increases by 11%, but this increases rapidly with\nfurther reductions of N, increasing by 40%, 120% and 560% at 60%, 50% and 40% N rate respectively. This latter increase\nin land occupation reflects more the lower protein concentration than reduced yield.\n4.1.2 Oilseed rape\nThe effects on N on rape were nominally similar to those for bread wheat, with a minimum energy need at about 75% of\ncurrent N, but the absolute effect was much smaller than for wheat with a reduction of only 1% PE. Because rape is grown\nprimarily for oil rather than protein, land occupation reflects yield reduction.\n4.1.3 Potatoes\nA large component of the energy (and other burdens) in potato production is cold storage. As it is a fresh crop and storage\nrequires refrigeration the energy burden amounts to 50% of the total primary energy input (Table 13). However the GWP\nper unit energy of maincrop potatoes is less that from other crops, because the energy comes mainly from combustion of\nfuels to CO2. Early potatoes have a similar ratio of GWP to PE use as other field crops, since there is no storage. 2nd\nearlies have only slightly lower yields than maincrop potatoes and so incur about half the burdens. 1st earlies yield about\nhalf that of maincrop, and, needing no storage, end up with about the same burdens as maincrop.\nThe burdens of organic and non-organic potato production are much more similar than for wheat, with energy and GWP100\nbeing 2% and 13% higher, on average, in organic production (Table 14). Organic pesticide use is 19% of non-organic.\nThis differs from wheat, where none are used, but this represents copper based products for blight control. The similarity\nof energy use is initially surprising, but results from the following: organic potatoes are lower yielding, but incur the same\nburdens for field machinery, which being a below-ground crop are relatively high; wastage of organic potatoes is twice as\nhigh as non-organic.\nBecause of the dominance of storage, reducing N input has a much smaller effect on total energy and GWP than with wheat\nor rape. The minimum energy use is at 92% of the current N rate, but the reduction is less than 0.1%.\nIrrigation increases potato yield, but uses extra energy. Increasing the proportion of potatoes irrigated from 0 to 100%\nincreases energy use per tonne by 4%, had no effect on GWP, but decreased land and pesticide use by 21%.\n5 Concluding Discussion\nThe results presented (and the working model) allow the burdens of British arable production to be calculated in a flexible\nway that illustrates the environmental performance of alternative production systems. The analysis is more detailed than\nothers for British crop production. Our results for non-organic production are broadly similar to those from other European\nstudies (Table 15). The values for organic systems differ more widely, with ours being notably higher than Danish results\nfor GWP. It is not clear, however, what systematic differences there are in terms of their farming systems or analysis\nmethods as they do not provide full details. Our analysis does not allow for niche production that cannot be extrapolated to\na national level. Our analysis is also based on long term technically sustainable systems.\nZ:\\Reducing_Environmental_Burdens-2010.doc Page 9 of 16 Last printed 03\/10\/2011 15:20:00\nThe use of system modelling is designed to allow alternative production systems to be analysed, e.g. reduced tillage or N\nfertiliser use. Reducing N use on bread wheat by about 25% reduced several impacts per t. In general however the\nreductions in burdens from alternative systems of production are less than their proponents suggest.\nMost alternatives increase the land occupation requirement per tonne of product. That is not a practical problem if land\nsupply is not limiting (e.g. the existence of set-aside), but as demand for biofuels and human food increases, this may not\nhold for long. Solutions which export the problems of food production must be avoided.\nThe system modelling also shows how the burdens of crop production vary with soil type, for example, wheat grown on\nsandy soils uses about 20% more energy and causes about 40% more GWP than when grown on clay soils.\nLarge amounts of energy are used for storing maincrop potatoes. There could be potential for reducing energy use here, but\nit needs a detailed study in its own right.\nThe results show that greenhouse gas emissions from arable agriculture are far more dependent on N2O than CO2 in\ncontrast to most manufacturing industry. That, together with the ill-effects of nitrate and ammonia emissions, leads to the\nobservation that agriculture does not have a carbon footprint as much as a C-N footprint. The key to reducing burdens from\nagriculture thus lies in reducing the need for nitrogen in the production of the target product e.g. food protein or energy.\nHowever given with the large influence of nitrous oxide on GWP, evaluation of nitrous oxide emissions by a more situation\ndependent method, e.g. crop-soil simulation modelling, instead of the more rigid IPCC method would improve the\nrobustness of the analysis. This would allow the possibility of alternatives that used the same amount of fertiliser input but\nwith lower emissions.\n6 References\n[1] Audsley, E., Alber, S., Clift, R., Cowell, S., Crettaz, P., Gaillard, G., Hausheer, J., Jolliett, O.,\nKleijn R., Mortensen, B., Pearce, D., Roger, E., Teulon, H., Weidema, B., and van Zeijts, H.
