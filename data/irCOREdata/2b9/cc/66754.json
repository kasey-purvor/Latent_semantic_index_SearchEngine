This article offers an assessment of the ethical status of territorial borders, arguing\nfor a partial defence of their role in international relations. Utilising the English School as one\nway such a defence has been developed, it assesses pluralist and solidarist arguments, suggest-\ning both are flawed. The article develops a notion of territorial borders as contributing to the\nvalue of tolerating difference in international relations, and that this is an ethically desirable\nthing to do. It doing so it utilises the political theory of Hannah Arendt as an alternative to\nmore common, if usually implicit, liberal understandings.\nIntroduction\nSome constitutive rules, like exclusive territoriality, are so deeply sedimented or reified that\nactors no longer think of them as rules at all.1\nImagining international relations without territorial borders is difficult. As Ruggie\nsuggests, in relation to establishing exclusive ownership of territory, territorial borders\nare fundamental to the way we think about international relations and vital to shap-\ning political practice. \u2018Constitutive rules are the institutional foundation of all social\nlife. No consciously organized realm of human activity is imaginable without them,\nincluding international politics.\u20192 International relations would not be international\nrelations without territorial borders.\nShould we perpetuate this situation? Should we obey the constitutive rules\nwherein territorial borders play such an important role? Are they the result of inertia\nafter centuries of \u2018sedimentation\u2019? Do practical, pragmatic politics make challenging\nterritorial borders too risky or costly? Are there ethical reasons for recognising and\nrespecting territorial borders and their associated rules?\nAnswering these questions, let alone providing a full account of the importance of\nterritorial borders, is an enormous task. This article offers one small part of an\nanswer by defending ethical reasons for respecting territorial borders, suggesting they\ncan contribute to tolerating diversity in international relations, and that tolerating\ndiversity is ethically desirable.\nThe territorial borders discussed here are those delimiting exclusive territoriality,\nhighlighted by Ruggie. The article is about the territorial borders of sovereign states.\nThis does not exhaust the range of borders in international relations. However,\nterritorial borders are fundamentally constitutive of the international relations as\ninterstate relations that still provides the bedrock, backdrop and starting point for\nmuch of the discipline\u2019s work, including this piece.\nThe article considers one important and self-consciously ethical justification of\nterritorial borders\u2014the idea of an \u2018international society\u2019 associated with the \u2018English\nSchool\u2019 of international relations theory. It assesses the problems this approach faces\nstemming from the greater prominence of human rights and similar issues, and\nrecent efforts to recast English School theory methodologically utilising construc-\ntivism. This has produced calls for a less state-based approach to understanding\ninternational society, with more room and a louder voice for non-state actors, especi-\nally individuals and those communities not institutionalised in or in control of\nsovereign states. This is contrasted with a \u2018classical pluralist\u2019 approach that sees\nborders as essential to order in an anarchic world of diverse states, generating a need\nfor toleration in the form of an international modus vivendi.\nThe article argues that the English School demonstrates a broadly liberal approach\nto the idea of toleration in its understanding of how states address the absence of\nrecognised and agreed universal values. Utilising the work of the leading political\ntheorist of toleration, Susan Mendus, suggests this liberal approach is inadequate.\nFinally, the article offers a richer approach to toleration, rooted in the political\ntheory of Hannah Arendt, developing an amended and revived pluralist ethical\nagenda. This approach includes classical English School arguments about borders\nbeing essential to create and maintain order amongst states in conditions of anarchy\nand, in particular, diversity. However, rather than this being a somewhat regrettable\nnecessity, the article asserts a more explicit and positive ethical assessment of\ndiversity and the role played by territorial borders. It puts diversity at the centre of\nthe human condition arguing territorial borders can play a part in protecting the\ndiversity that is an essential part of a progressive politics that gives more space and a\ngreater voice to individual and non-state groups. Diversity needs to be tolerated in\nthe sense of being positively valued and engaged with as part of an open politics,\nrather than reluctantly forborne as a result of circumstance or necessity. The article\ndefends pluralism and a pluralist English School theory of the states-system via a\nmore far-reaching concept of toleration, a concept that challenges classical pluralism\u2019s\nconservative, statist focus to argue for a place for territorial borders in an open,\ndiverse and tolerant international politics.\nInternational society, territorial borders and plurality3\nPolitical geographers have criticised a lack of conceptual thinking about territory in\ninternational relations, arguing the approach has been static, taken for granted and\noverly concerned with exclusion and exclusivity.4 The English School5 is arguably\n738 John Williams\n3 \u2018Plurality\u2019 and \u2018pluralism\u2019 refer to different ethical and normative schemas amongst states. \u2018Diversity\u2019\nand \u2018diverse\u2019 refer to such differences amongst individuals and non-state communities.\n4 For example, John Agnew and Stuart Corbridge, Mastering Space: Hegemony, Territory and Political\nEconomy (London: Routledge, 1995).\n5 English School is used to refer to the body of theory, international society to the political situation\nmost closely associated with this theory.\nguilty of this static and exclusivist approach. \u2018From the perspective of any particular\nstate what it hopes to gain chiefly from participation in the society of states is\nrecognition of its independence of outside authority, and in particular its supreme\njurisdiction over its subjects and territory\u2019.6 Borders establish and define sovereign\nownership of territory and jurisdictional authority. State territory ought to be inviol-\nable, whether by secession, irredentism or annexation, or by coercive interference in\nthe state\u2019s affairs. These principles\u2014territorial integrity and non-intervention\u2014are\nvital goals states hope to fulfil through membership of the states-system. Both\npresuppose borders as delimiters of sovereign territory, inextricable from the\nfoundational principle of sovereignty. Territorial borders in this sense are politico-\njuridical, rather than sociological, although the article suggests that maintaining\nsuch a clear distinction is neither as easy nor as necessary as sometimes argued.7\nHowever, the protection borders grant states is conditional. \u2018International society\nhas in fact treated the preservation of the independence of particular states as a goal\nthat is subordinate to the preservation of the society of states itself \u2019.8 However,\nwhilst true of the particular borders of particular states the idea of whichever states\nare in existence at any time having territorial borders remains vital to the funda-\nmental perpetuation of international society.9\nThe English School thus fits with Ruggie\u2019s assertion about borders as reified\nconstitutive rules. Adam Watson argues, \u2018No system has existed without rules and\nconventions of some kind, and it is difficult to see how one could\u2019.10 Robert Jackson\noften appeals to \u2018political reality\u2019 in defence of international society as a normative\nframework, a reality meaningless, indeed non-existent, without a specific understand-\ning of territorial borders.11\nIf territorial borders are fundamental to international order because they create\nand maintain an international society, why is there a need for order? Bull argues\norder is, \u2018. . . a pattern of activity that sustains elementary, primary or universal\ngoals of social life\u2019.12 Without order life would not be worth living. The main\nchallenge to international order is anarchy, although Bull is sceptical about anarchy\ninevitably reproducing amongst states a Hobbesian state of nature.13 Nevertheless,\nexploring the states-system\u2019s development in mitigating the effects of anarchy is a\nprincipal concern of the English School.14 Territorial borders are crucial to basic\nTerritorial borders, toleration and the English School 739\n6 Hedley Bull, The Anarchical Society: a Study of Order in World Politics (London: Macmillan, 1977),\np. 17.\n7 Robert Jackson, The Global Covenant: Human Conduct in a World of States (Oxford: Oxford\nUniversity Press, 2000), pp. 316\u201335.\n8 Bull, Anarchical Society, p. 17.\n9 Ibid., p. 16.\n10 Adam Watson, The Evolution of International Society: a Comparative Historical Analysis (London:\nRoutledge, 1992), p. 312.\n11 Jackson, Global Covenant, pp. 377\u201399.\n12 Bull, Anarchical Society, p. 5.\n13 Ibid., pp. 46\u201351.

These contribute to maintaining order and\npreventing challenges to the system such as a successful drive to universal empire.\nWhilst this addresses the \u2018supreme jurisdiction over . . . territory\u2019, where does this\nleave the \u2018subjects\u2019 over which Bull asserts states seek supreme jurisdiction? English\nSchool theory considers the relationship between domestic political developments\nand the states-system, and vice versa. For example, Martin Wight recognised how\nnationalism and self-determination had implications for recognition.15 The \u2018subjects\u2019\nof territorially delimited states have a role to play in this account.\nRecognising the historically changing nature of states, including the political\naspirations and expectations of their inhabitants, hints at problems faced by the\nEnglish School on the issue of borders.16 Popular sovereignty emphasises that many\ngovernments are poor representatives of popular political will and underpins claims\nof secession and irredentism. State coercion and repression often meet these pres-\nsures for change and reform. We need to navigate between protecting constitutive\nrules of the system linked to inviolable territorial borders and responding to popular\npressure for change. How much \u2018domestic\u2019 injustice can be borne in the name of\nprotecting a system of \u2018international\u2019 order?17 Jackson\u2019s defence of the \u2018classical\u2019\napproach to theorising international society stresses the difficult and often agonising\ndecisions political and military leaders may face as a result.18\nEthical diversity and the role of territorial borders as delimiters of political\ncommunities exacerbates the problem in international society. Such communities are\nnot just a group of people bound together by collective subjection to sovereign\nauthority. They may share distinctive views of themselves and the world in contrast\nto other such communities. For classical pluralists in particular this communal\nethical diversity adds to the need for order in international politics and thus the need\nto respect territorial borders.19 Such \u2018national\u2019 identity, idealised in the nation-state,\nis only one collective identity. However, it is most important in this discussion and\nhighlights the problem of maintaining a strict distinction between juridical and\nsociological conceptualisations of borders in international society.\nIt also raises the issue of borders as mechanisms for toleration in international\nsociety. Territorial borders and associated rules of sovereignty, territorial integrity\nand non-intervention have helped states co-exist in an orderly fashion and with less\nviolence and chaos than might otherwise have ensued. International society is partly\ncharacterised by an agreement to disagree on the correct way to order domestic\nsociety, economy, politics and justice, given the absence of general agreement on\nprinciples governing such arrangements. This claim to establish toleration of diver-\nsity is important to classical pluralism and key to its understanding of the positive\n740 John Williams\n15 Wight, Systems of States, especially ch. 6.\n16 For analysis of the way changing state forms affect the states-system, with some faint praise for the\nEnglish School, see Mlada Bukovansky, \u2018The Altered State and the State of Nature\u2014the French\nRevolution and International Politics\u2019, Review of International Studies, 25:2 (1999).\n17 John Vincent, Human Rights and International Relations (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press,\n1986).

However, it rests on a flawed notion of toleration and\nestablishes a system of tolerance that is too narrowly focused on states and too\nbroad in the leeway it grants states to practice domestic intolerance.\nThe double problem of anarchy and diversity contributes to the \u2018pluralist\u2019 versus\n\u2018solidarist\u2019 dispute within the English School. For my purposes this tension is\ncrucially about how far diversity precludes universal ethical principles operating in\ninternational society and when such principles might override norms, including non-\nintervention, central to order in anarchy.\nThis tension is evident in Bull\u2019s writings: \u2018. . . if any value attaches to order in\nworld politics, it is order among all mankind which we must treat as being of\nprimary value, not order within the society of states. If international order does have\nvalue, this can only be because it is instrumental to the goal of order in human\nsociety as a whole\u2019.20 This reflects a cosmopolitan ethical schema wherein indi-\nviduals are, \u2018. . . permanent and indestructible . . .\u2019.21 \u2018[T]he rights and benefits to\nwhich justice has to be done in the international community are not simply those of\nstates and nations, but those of individual persons throughout the world as a whole.\n. . . [T]he idea of the rights and duties of the individual person has come to have a\nplace, albeit an insecure one, and it is our responsibility to extend it\u2019.22\nHowever, political realities make this cosmopolitanism impractical: \u2018This is the\nmoment for international relations . . .\u2019,23 reflecting the absence of a world society of\nindividuals and \u2018the reality of [an] international society\u2019 of states.24 Borders consti-\ntute international society as pluralist, reinforcing artificial, but very important,\nnational identities, political differences and disputes. Borders close off international\npolitics from widespread participation by establishing international society as a\nsubstantially separate space of politics populated by states\u2019 representatives, rather\nthan people more generally.\nPluralist thought goes further than this plurality of states\u2019 dominant domestic\nethical frameworks, though, because of Bull\u2019s scepticism about the particular nature\nof ostensibly universal ethical schemes.25 \u2018. . . [T]here is no consensus in the world\nbehind the program [sic] of Western solidarists . . . for \u201ctranscending the states-\nsystem\u201d.\u201926 Bull\u2019s defence of pluralism emphasises its inescapability in state practice\nand the need for prudence, sensitivity and humility about Western cosmopolitanism\nand its potential dangers.27 However, there remains, \u2018. . . the need that we recognize\nto inculcate a greater sense of unity in human society, [and] that it is upon the states-\nsystem that our hopes . . ., at least in the short run, must depend.\u201928 Prudence is the\nprincipal political virtue in Jackson\u2019s defence of pluralism, including in circum-\nstances of Western hubris about its triumph or superiority.29\nTerritorial borders, toleration and the English School 741\n20 Bull, Anarchical Society, p. 22.\n21 Ibid., p. 22.\n22 Bull, Justice in International Relations, p. 12.\n23 Bull, Anarchical Society, p. 22.\n24 Ibid., p. 40. For discussion see Nicholas J. Wheeler and Timothy Dunne, \u2018Hedley Bull\u2019s Pluralism of\nthe Intellect and Solidarism of the Will\u2019, International Affairs, 72:1 (1996).\n25 For example, Bull, Justice in International Relations.\n26 Hedley Bull, \u2018The State\u2019s Positive Role in World Affairs\u2019, D\u00e6dalus, 108:4 (1979), p. 120.\n27 Bull, \u2018Positive Role\u2019, pp. 122\u20133. Bull, Justice in International Relations, pp. 10\u201311.\n28 Bull, \u2018Positive Role\u2019, p. 120.\n29 On prudence see Jackson, Global Covenant, p. 21 and passim. On the hubris of the West, see\npp. 366\u201370.\nHowever, neither Bull or Jackson provide a positive defence of ethical diversity in\ncontemporary international society. Their pluralism is importantly the result of\ncircumstance and fear about potential disorder stemming from a more solidarist\nline.30 Territorial borders contribute to toleration in a pluralist international society\nbecause they help give us reasons to put up with diversity amongst states until this\ncan be overcome.\nFor Chris Brown classical pluralism is thus a \u2018second best\u2019, and inadequate, theory\nof international relations. By this he means that it generates an ethic for the world as\nit is despite recognising the ethical superiority, were it attainable, of a cosmopolitan\nworld based on universal human moral equivalency.31 Bull and Jackson would\npresumably demur from this characterisation, but the charge carries some force.\nJackson, for example, side-steps Brown\u2019s claim. \u2018The thrust of the argument . . .\nrejects the illusory belief that the conduct of statespeople can be judged by applying\nthe theories of moral philosophers\u2019.32 Instead the actions of statespeople can only be\njudged by their own standards, rendering them immune to vast swathes of ethical\ncritique. This also very substantially narrows Wight\u2019s channels whereby domestic\npolitics can influence international society, something the article will try to reverse.\nFor Jackson, change and development comes exclusively from within the tradi-\ntions of conduct in international society, hence the irrelevance of moral philosophy\nand other normative discourses. For Jackson, toleration can only be about putting\nup with diversity amongst territorially defined and bordered states because these\nstates define the reality of the system from within which the problem arises and from\nwithin whose limited practices any solution must appear. However, as Bull noted,\nsystem perpetuation is at the heart of classical pluralism\u2019s normative vision, consign-\ning us to more of the same until diplomatic practice somehow overcomes this\nproblem or the system collapses.\nNevertheless, some contemporary English School theory has taken up Brown\u2019s\ncharge. Explicitly constructivist approaches, as developed by Dunne and Wheeler for\nexample, champion solidarism, asserting international society\u2019s potential contribution\nto a cosmopolitan ethical order.33 Similarly, Linklater utilises Habermasian Critical\nTheory to situate international society within a more cosmopolitan, and ethically\nsuperior, worldview.34 Constructivist and Critical approaches reopen the potential for\nchange from below in international society and stress the connection to a putative\ncosmopolitan world society. They emphasise how Bull\u2019s appeal to \u2018the reality of\ninternational society\u2019 need not separate ethical aspirations, such as a cosmopolitan\nhuman rights, from international relations theory. The constructivist view of the\nconstitutive rules of international relations as being mutable ideational structures\nopens features such as anarchy to far reaching ethical, and other, questioning.35\n742 John Williams\n30 Bull, Justice in International Relations, pp. 12\u201318.

If \u2018anarchy is what\nstates make of it\u2019 and the \u2018facts\u2019 of international politics are inseparable from the\n\u2018values\u2019 inherent in a theory of international politics which orders and prioritises\nfacts we need a more explicit theory of the ethics of an anarchical structure.\nWheeler\u2019s survey of such efforts suggests this is difficult.36 The question of why we\nshould condone morally despicable behaviour, such as torture and massacre, in the\nname of respecting territorial borders becomes almost unanswerable.\nJackson\u2019s unsatisfactory closure of the debate to anything other than the existing\nstandards that generate the problem in the first place ensures its perpetuation. He\nemphasises statespeople as doing \u2018real\u2019 international relations, placing commentators\nand academics in subservient positions, able only to try and imagine themselves into\nthe shoes of statespeople, becoming as hidebound as they by an excessively conserv-\native portrayal of international society.37 As it is statespeople who have power they\nmust absorb our attention, he argues, making it unnecessary, even damaging, to\nconsider the world from the viewpoint of the victims of such power.38 Jackson\u2019s\nteleological portrayal of history leads us progressively to the present international\nsociety that is not only the way the world works but also the only way it could. Each\nnew accretion of law, custom, case and diplomatic practice edges international\nsociety slowly forward within its cocoon of separateness from other political and\nsocial practice.39 It is international society as Gormenghast.\nThe pluralist strand of English School theory is rendered incapable of finding\nnew and better ways of addressing the dilemmas and agonising decisions Jackson\nurges sensitivity towards. Rather than condemning statespeople to more of the same\nby denying them any tools other than those already available, pluralism ought, as the\nconstructivist solidarists are doing, to look beyond diplomatic tradition, custom and\npractice. International relations ought not, indeed cannot, separate itself off from\nthe rest of human conduct and the insights within.\nFor solidarists seeking to expand universal ethics in international society, anarchy\nand diversity are complicating factors, barriers to the recognition of a cosmopolitan\ntruth about human beings. These complications are linked to territorial borders via\nnational self-determination and the idealisation of the state as the manifestation of a\ndistinctive community whose shared history, culture and traditions render it at least\npartially inexplicable to outsiders who should not attempt to interfere in its affairs.40\nThis is backed by appeals to the constitutive rules of international society, via the\ndoctrine of non-intervention, rooted in the overriding duty of states to maintain\ntheir own existence via maintaining the existence of international society itself.\nA \u2018constructivised\u2019 English School theory struggles to produce an ethical defence\nof the states-system. It is committed to territorial borders as essential constitutive\nrules without which the states-system cannot exist as an international society.\nHowever, these rules undermine, even deny, the existence of an essential human\nTerritorial borders, toleration and the English School 743\n36 Nicholas J.

Whilst not an\narticle about humanitarian intervention per se, being a more general consideration\nof territorial borders, some preliminary thoughts are offered later on how the revived\npluralist agenda the article outlines contributes to debates about humanitarian\nintervention.\nMoving the burden of supporting territorial borders away from anarchy and\ntowards the need for order in conditions of ethical diversity, and particularly the\ntoleration of such diversity as being ethically desirable, ameliorates the problem of\nimposing, or being seen to impose, a single and specific ethical schema. Formulating\nthis defence of diversity needs to avoid placing such emphasis on the specific\ncircumstances of international society, limiting it to the level of the state and making\nits defence reliant upon isolating the nature and character of international politics\nfrom that of human life more generally. A more explicit, richer and more positive\ndefence of toleration than either Bull or Jackson offers can reinvigorate the pluralist\nwing of the English School.\nHowever, this requires a conceptualisation of toleration different from the\nimmediately obvious one, rooted in liberal political thought. A discussion of liberal\napproaches to toleration remains useful because it throws light on weaknesses in\nboth classical and constructivist English School theory.\nThe concept of toleration\nToleration is demanding, it requires us, \u2018. . . to practice tolerance even when it is\ntroublesome and painful to do so\u2019.42 Toleration is about accepting the validity of\nthings we find distasteful, even things we find morally abhorrent.43 Toleration is thus\noften linked with liberty and a liberal view of politics. However, this may not be a\nwholly satisfactory position.\nToleration as a specifically liberal virtue is nevertheless a common idea with some\napparent parallels with the English School.44 Indeed, Jackson specifically identifies his\nversion of pluralism with a liberal \u2018forbearance and toleration\u2019.45 John Locke and J.S.\nMill offer principal sources for liberal approaches to toleration, elements of both are\ndiscernible in English School thinking.46 This section will consider how this relates to\nclassical pluralism first, before moving to its role in contemporary solidarism.\nLocke advocates religious toleration because coercing genuine faith is impossible\nand therefore futile. Religious intolerance is only justifiable where religious practices\n744 John Williams\n41 For example, Wheeler, Saving Strangers, p. 38.\n42 Glenn Tinder, Tolerance: Toward a New Civility (Amherst, MA: University of Massachusetts Press,\n1976), p. 8.\n43 Susan Mendus, Toleration and the Limits of Liberalism (Houndmills: Macmillan, 1989), pp. 8\u201318.\n44 Joseph Raz, \u2018Autonomy, Toleration and the Harm Principle\u2019, in Susan Mendus (ed.), Justifying\nToleration: Conceptual and Historical Perspectives (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1988),\np. 155; Tinder, Tolerance.\n45 Jackson, Global Covenant, p. 139.\n46 This account of Locke and Mill relies principally on Mendus, Toleration and the Limits of Liberalism,\npp. 22\u201368.\nthreaten state security. In such circumstances it is not faith that is being regarded\nintolerantly, but consequences of actions springing from faith.\nAnd if, peradventure, such were the state of affairs, that the interest of the commonwealth\nrequired all slaughter of beasts should be forborn while, in order to the increasing of the\nstock of cattle, that had been destroyed by some extraordinary murrain; who sees not that the\nmagistrate, in such a case, may forbid all his subjects to kill any calves for any use\nwhatsoever? Only it is to be observed, that in this case the law is not made about a religious,\nbut a political matter: nor is the sacrifice, but the slaughter of calves thereby prohibited.47\nLocke\u2019s clear, simple argument is appealing, and seemingly appropriate to inter-\nnational society by analogy, leaving aside doubts about the empirical accuracy of the\nimpossibility of coercing changes in faith.48 Forcibly altering domestic political\npractices that infringe human rights, for example, is indefensible except in the most\nextreme cases. Only through winning the arguments can respect for human rights be\nentrenched in societies that presently reject them.\nThe extreme circumstances justifying forcible intervention are limited to human\nrights abuses so serious they threaten the security of states and international society.\nThis chimes with Bull\u2019s identification of the perpetuation of the society of states as a\nfundamental goal that may require the forbearance of injustice. Similar arguments\nexist in political practice: the United Nations Security Council has used threats to\ninternational peace and security to address humanitarian disasters.49\nLocke\u2019s argument appears to have utility as an ethic of toleration for international\nsociety. However, it does not generate a positive reason for toleration, or explain why\ntoleration is promoted by the territorial states-system. Locke tolerates religious\ndiversity because forcibly imposing religious uniformity is impossible. Locke has a\ndefinite conception of what he wishes universalised\u2014Protestantism\u2014and toleration\nis only a virtue because circumstances make this impractical. Toleration is prudential\nor circumstantial rather than a positive virtue.50\nWe have seen that prudence is important in Bull and Jackson\u2019s pluralism. They\nmay not share Locke\u2019s commitment to a particular view of the good life\u2014both\nreject advocacy of the superiority of Western liberal democratic capitalism51\u2014but\nthey would agree there are intolerable forms of political life. This is because they\nthreaten basic structures of order, in this case international society. Political forms\nrejecting sovereign statehood as the basis for order and coexistence in anarchy and\ndiversity are unlikely to be forborne, let alone tolerated. A Burkeian conservatism on\nthe basis of tradition and custom and out of fear for the fragility of order reinforces\nthis limited toleration.52\nTerritorial borders, toleration and the English School 745\n47 John Horton and Susan Mendus (eds.), John Locke \u2018A Letter Concerning Toleration\u2019 in Focus\n(London: Routledge, 1991), pp. 36\u20137.\n48 Selina Chen, \u2018Locke\u2019s Political Arguments for Toleration\u2019, History of Political Thought, 19:2 (1998),\np. 169.\n49 John Williams, \u2018The Ethical Basis of Humanitarian Intervention, the Security Council and\nYugoslavia\u2019, International Peacekeeping, 6:2 (1999).\n50 Chen, \u2018Locke\u2019s Political Arguments for Toleration\u2019 offers a more positive assessment. However, this\nrests on cosmopolitan assumptions about universal rationality that leaves it open to similar\nteleological challenges as apply to Mill.\n51 Bull, Justice in International Relations. Jackson, Global Covenant, pp. 51\u20138.\n52 I am grateful to an anonymous referee for emphasising Bull\u2019s use of Burke. Jackson cites him\nrepeatedly in Global Covenant.\nJ.S. Mill seems of more use in constructing a positive liberal argument because he\nemphasises the virtue of diversity. Mill claims that valuing, even encouraging,\ndiversity in society ensures as many opportunities as possible for progress. Tolerating\ndiversity prevents society slipping into conformity, torpor, conservatism and back-\nwardness. Hearing as many voices and seeing as many alternatives as possible\nprotects the creative spark enabling social progress.\nBull\u2019s uncertainty about the superiority of Western ideas and his appeals for\nsensitivity towards other cultures echoes this kind of reasoning. The pluralism of\ninternational society matters because it offers different voices against which we can\njudge ourselves, interact with and learn from.53 This reinforces prudential concerns\nabout the risks of imposing universality.\nMill\u2019s enthusiasm for diversity sometimes approaches valuing eccentricity for\neccentricity\u2019s sake. However, Mill\u2019s teleology of progress restricts his tolerance and,\nultimately, Bull\u2019s too. Unlike Locke, Mill offers only a weak reason why we should\ntolerate that of which we morally disapprove.54 Locke\u2019s answer is the impossibility of\nchanging beliefs (although he does not extend such licence to action resulting from\nsuch beliefs). Mill\u2019s answer is weak because he stresses toleration\u2019s purpose being\nto foster progress and improvements in society. A strong prescriptive element\ninforms Mill\u2019s conception of progress\u2014predicated upon the principles of Utilitarian\nliberalism\u2014meaning that the licence of toleration within society is limited.\nSimilarly, classical English School pluralists tolerate diversity within states if it\ndoes not threaten order in international society by undermining progress in\nextending the enmeshing web of rules and principles entrenching order amongst\nstates. Jackson\u2019s unease over possible extensions to the jus ad bellum sanctioning\nhumanitarian intervention is indicative.55 Progress in restricting legitimate causes of\nwar should be tampered with only with extreme caution and a presumption in\nfavour of the status quo. Bull\u2019s approving summary of the development of natural\nlaw thinking, one of the few positive things he has to say about natural law, and its\nrole in shaping contemporary understandings of problems such as this, also hints at\na teleological view of progress in our knowledge and understanding.56\nThe scope of toleration is therefore likely to narrow over time as agreement\ndevelops. As Bull notes, \u2018The future of international society is likely to be deter-\nmined, among other things, by the preservation and extension of a cosmopolitan\nculture, embracing both common ideas and common values, and rooted in societies\nin general as well as in their elites\u2019.57 The process is the refinement of the rules,\nnorms and principles of behaviour tying states to international society and ensuring\nthose issues and problems deemed to matter in international relations are principally\nthose comprehensible to and manageable within international society. Diversity\nwithin states is not extended to, and is significantly limited by, the similarity of states\nin international society.\nMill\u2019s seemingly positive reason for tolerating diversity is more restricted than at\nfirst sight. Mill gives us reason to tolerate what we dislike, but not that we morally\n746 John Williams\n53 Bull, Anarchical Society, p. 317.\n54 D. D.

The inherent vision of the good life within\nMill\u2019s liberalism\u2014its individualism, belief in the public\/private divide, its particular\nvision of political participation, its utilitarianism\u2014make it inimical to those who do\nnot share this teleological vision of history or have a different ontology of the good\nlife. Classical English School pluralists also have a view of the good life for states\u2014\nthe global covenant of international society\u2014and a toleration of diversity within its\nparameters and confined by territorial borders to a specific place, within the\nsovereign state. Territorial borders thus limit toleration and identify those areas\nwhere its licence is greatest and those where it is highly restricted. International\nsociety, as Blaney and Inayatullah argue, stems from \u2018the Westphalian deferral\u2019 of\nthe diversity question in international relations. International society does not fully\nanswer or even address the issue of diversity, instead deferring it by limiting it to and\ncontaining it within states in ways that are increasingly unstable and that seriously\nchallenge classical pluralism\u2019s perspective.58\nAlternative views of international relations and ethical systems challenging the\nglobal covenant pose the greatest test for toleration. A positive ethical defence of\nterritorial borders must deal with the challenge of tolerating that of which we\nmorally disapprove, something which liberalism, on this very short survey, struggles\nto do as fully as is necessary.59 Radical alternative challenges may be accepted for\npractical and pragmatic reasons, but they are not valued, their heretical opinions\nprotected\u2014we do not tolerate them in the full meaning of the term.\nConstructivist solidarism shares an implicitly liberal approach to toleration.\nTerritorial borders are understood differently\u2014as Ruggie\u2019s sedimented and reified\nconstitutive rules\u2014but with similar ethical implications. Excavating the sediment\nand challenging the reification questions the idea of territorial borders as \u2018givens\u2019 or\n\u2018brute facts\u2019, opening them to ethical enquiry. Utilising constructivism to solidarist\nends means borders must be justifiable within an individual-focused ethical agenda.\nThis is difficult whilst they establish exclusive territoriality and associated principles\nlike non-intervention, even in the face of morally abhorrent behaviour as judged\nagainst an ideal cosmopolitan standard.60\nThis move importantly sharpens English School theory\u2019s critical edge, a goal of\ncontemporary solidarists. It recasts territorial borders\u2019 ethical status as either\nderivative from their contribution to protecting political communities where cosmo-\npolitan ethical standards are fulfilled, or closely approximated; or as circumstantial\nwithin a mechanism generating order in the non-ideal conditions of international\npolitics, preventing worse evils arising from enforced ethical homogeneity. What\nseems certain is that international society remains an ethically \u2018second best\u2019 arrange-\nment of international relations as it relates to the existence and importance of\nterritorial borders.\nToleration becomes restricted to practices that both conform to dominant norms\nof international society and are reconcilable with certain cosmopolitan standards.\nStates professing such standards should bear some costs in more active pursuit of\nthese ends, tempered by the need to respect and protect order and within limiting\nTerritorial borders, toleration and the English School 747\n58 David L.

This toleration is, though, principally prudential,\ncircumstantial and of derivative ethical significance, mirroring the status of territorial\nborders. The largely liberal version of solidarism advocated by Wheeler, for example,\nbrings with it a liberal concept of toleration. As we have seen, this struggles to\nproduce a justification for international society and constitutive norms like territorial\nborders that is explicit and above all positive in its toleration of diversity, including\npotentially radical diversity from the norms of international society.\nA richer concept of toleration\nPrudence, circumstance, the realities of power, anguish and uncertainty about Western\nvalues all contribute to an understanding of toleration in classical pluralism that\nfalls victim to the weaknesses of a liberal version of toleration. Contemporary\nconstructivist solidarism does not escape this failure of liberalism to generate an\nexplicit and positive reason to tolerate diversity in the full sense of the term. A\nricher concept of toleration is necessary. This must be more open to alternative\nconceptions of the good life, of the ontological status of human beings and of the\nnature of politics. It needs to address a more diverse international political system\nand accommodate a wider range of actors. It must also protect what is essential by\nidentifying what is intolerable. Toleration means the positive valuing of and\nengagement with diversity in ways that are not prejudged or inevitably circumscribed\nby the system within which we operate or aspire to operate.\nThis is a very tall order indeed, and this article only outlines how such a project\nmight begin. A stronger concept of toleration needs to deal with radical difference,\neven in the form of hatred, prejudice and conflict. These are negative forces that\nought to be opposed and, if possible, eradicated. However, they are also amongst the\nmost powerful motivations for political action and are prominent in political con-\nduct. Genuine toleration, living and engaging with that we morally disapprove of,\nneeds better ways of understanding and addressing these \u2018negative\u2019 forces in a\npluralist international society.\nThis is where Hannah Arendt comes into play. Arendt\u2019s breadth of interests makes\nother than skimming the surface of her potential contribution to international\npolitical theory impossible here. In placing an ethic of toleration at the heart of a\npluralist English School this skimming may prove profitable.\nArendt\u2019s potential contribution is twofold and distinctive. Firstly is her\ncommitment to diversity as essential to human existence. \u2018. . . [W]e are all the same,\nthat is, human, in such a way that nobody is ever the same as anyone else who ever\nlived, lives or will live\u2019.62 Multiple perspectives are necessary to establish meaning,\n748 John Williams\n61 Nicholas J. Wheeler and Tim Dunne, \u2018Good International Citizenship: a Third Way for British\nForeign Policy?\u2019 International Affairs, 74:4 (1998); Bull, Justice in International Relations, p. 13.\n62 Hannah Arendt, The Human Condition (Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press, 1958), p. 8.\nJackson quotes this line (The Global Covenant, p. 407) although Arendt\u2019s analysis of diversity and its\nimplications for contemporary politics makes little impact on Jackson\u2019s thinking.\nmeaningfulness and a sense of common reality in human affairs. We cannot under-\nstand who we are, as opposed to what we are, outside of the condition of diversity in\nrelation to other human beings. Diversity is neither unfortunate accident of history\nor byproduct of the states-system. It cannot be deferred, but must be addressed head\non.\nDiversity\u2019s centrality to the human condition and the nature of political action\ndoes not preclude potential comprehensibility and understanding amongst indi-\nviduals and the communities they form. Neither is comprehensibility confined to\nelite statespeople immune from criticism on other than their own terms. Nor is\ndiversity simple individualism. Individuals are rooted, conditioned creatures via\nhistories and communities that are vital, in both senses of the term. For Arendt, one\ncan only be an individual within a social context, but society does not generate\nhomogeneity. Diversity within communities is at least as great as that between them,\nbut individuals can only recognise their diversity and understand who they are by\ncomparison and engagement with others with whom they share much in common.63\nWhilst a theorist of the bounded community, Arendt\u2019s account of history stresses\nthat ideas of separate, national histories prescribing final destinations are a modern\naberration.64 However, from this misnomer stem idealised, fixed and permanent\nboundaries that have to be included in any account of politics. Diversity cannot be\ntranscended, yet its forms are constructed, flexible and conditioned by human action\nand discourse in innumerable and highly unpredictable ways. Because diversity is\ninescapable and essential to meaningfulness in human affairs, valuing and protecting\nit is part of a human politics that relies on interaction within communities. Diversity\ngoes far wider than the plurality of states, although this is important, creating a\nneed to expand connections between the diversity of human beings and their\ncommunities, and the institutions, like international society, where diversity is\nworked out.\nFor example, reflecting on the Holocaust, Arendt defends her self-recognition as a\nJew, an identity inextricable from social and political circumstances contributing to\nthe idea of Jewishness. She contrasts this with appeals to \u2018humanity\u2019 in resisting\nNazism, criticising those dismissing specific identity as the source of resistance.\n\u2018Those who reject such identifications may feel wonderfully superior to the world\n. . ., but their superiority is . . . the superiority of a more or less well-equipped\ncloud-cuckoo-land\u2019.65\nArendt takes Nazism deeply seriously. It is a force to be understood and engaged\nwith, rather than dismissed out of hand as \u2018evil\u2019 and with no place in politics.\nDiversity, rooted in individual action and intersubjective construction of individuals\nwithin communities, is essential to resisting such projects. In Arendt\u2019s account of\nTerritorial borders, toleration and the English School 749\n63 Arendt uses the terms \u2018plurality\u2019 and \u2018pluralism\u2019 to identify the diversity of individuals and the\ndiversity of communities respectively, both of which are subsumed within my use of \u2018diversity\u2019.\nObviously adopting Arendt\u2019s usage here would be impossibly confusing. The distinction is an\nimportant one in Arendt\u2019s thought and hopefully context and qualification mean some of its force is\nretained despite being somewhat glossed over.\n64 Hannah Arendt, \u2018The Concept of History\u2019, in Hannah Arendt, Between Past and Future (New York:\nPenguin Books, 1977).\n65 Hannah Arendt, \u2018On Humanity in Dark Times: Thoughts about Lessing\u2019, in Hannah Arendt, Men in\nDark Times (London: Jonathan Cape, 1970), p. 18.\nEichmann\u2019s trial, the evil of the Holocaust is striking for the banality of so many of\nits actions, reducing genocide to bureaucratic trivia, dispute and turf fight. The\n\u2018banality of evil\u2019 cannot be resisted by abstract principles, even ones claiming to be\nuniversal, but by everyday, socially rooted resistance based on real lives, identities\nand communities.66 Through the interaction and interplay of these a more genuine\nuniversality may be built that can effectively resist totalitarian forces.\nConcluding her analysis of totalitarianism, Arendt emphasises its destruction not\njust of public life, as tyrannies had done in the past, but of private life as well,\nundermining liberalism\u2019s separation of the two. Loneliness\u2014the utter isolation of\nindividuals from their communities under totalitarianism\u2014destroys the human\nability to participate in meaningful relationships with others. \u2018What makes loneliness\nso unbearable is the loss of one\u2019s own self which can be realized in solitude, but\nconfirmed in its identity only by the trusting and trustworthy company of my equals.\nIn this situation, man loses trust in himself as the partner of his thoughts and that\nelementary confidence in the world which is necessary to make experiences at all\u2019.67\nWithout community and involvement, human identity and the potential for positive\naction, Arendt\u2019s definition of freedom, is unprotected.68\nThe second way Arendt offers a fresh approach stems from emphasising diversity\nas desirable and the sort of politics this necessitates. Arendt accuses modern, Western,\npredominantly liberal versions of politics of threatening diversity, homogenising\npeople and undermining their role in a politics potentially able to address these\npowerful, \u2018negative\u2019 motivations.\nHer idea of a genuine, \u2018worldly\u2019 politics distinguishes Arendt from liberalism\nand its inadequate, if arguably dominant, approach to toleration in international\nrelations.69 Arendt believes abstract philosophical bases for virtues, such as\ntoleration, are inadequate, unreflective of a socially constructed reality, the result\nof human activity and history.70 Appeals to universality are possible but only\nthrough sharing values via discourse and interaction, rather than through asserting\nabstract bases. They must come from human action, not from thought alone.71\nEngaging with the world, by acting within it, is properly political action. It\nhappens within and helps to create and protect a space where others can respond\nto our actions, creating ties, bonds, communities and also the potential, often\nstymied, for universality.\nArendt\u2019s ideal political world clearly echoes the Athenian agora\u2019s politics of direct\ncitizen participation. Well aware this situation cannot be replicated in the modern\nworld, Arendt nevertheless wishes politics would aspire to this spirit. She fears\nconceptual rigidity and over-concentration on institutions damages the space in-\n750 John Williams\n66 Hannah Arendt, Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil (London: Faber and Faber,\n1963).\n67 Hannah Arendt, Origins of Totalitarianism, New edn. with added prefaces (New York: Harcourt\nBrace Jovanovich, 1973), p. 477.\n68 Margaret Canovan, The Political Thought of Hannah Arendt (London: J.

These will render mass participation unnecessary, giving responsibility for\nmanaging these schemes to a small class of professional political craftsmen. Bull and\nJackson\u2019s stress upon diplomatic culture leaves them vulnerable to this charge.\nThese two insights enable an alternative approach to toleration that is particularly\nrelevant to international relations. Arendt says, \u2018. . . [T]he world and the people\nwho inhabit it are not the same. The world lies between people, and this in-between\n. . . is today the object of the greatest concern and the most obvious upheaval in all\nthe countries of the globe\u2019.74 Engaging openly and fully with the different is the way\nwe engage with ourselves. We need to act in the world, to open ourselves to\nengagement with those with whom we are familiar and with those with whom we are\nnot.\nTurning to Arendt utilises the methodological space opened by constructivism in\nan unusual way. Rather than seeking to reconceptualise borders as social constructs,\ndown-playing an immutable anarchy to promote a cosmopolitan ethical agenda,\nArendt\u2019s thought potentially reinvigorates pluralism. By concentrating on and\ncelebrating diversity\u2019s centrality to the human condition, rather than limited to the\nsovereign state level, a pluralistic ethical agenda rooted in the virtue of toleration\nbecomes possible. Arendt does not deny the role of the state, but takes diversity and\ntoleration much further. Arendt offers good reasons to tolerate that which we\nmorally disapprove of and also establishes the ethical significance of territorial\nborders.\nArendt\u2019s political theory of toleration throws new light on pluralism in inter-\nnational society. International society exists in a specific time and place, resulting\nfrom historical choices, decisions and reasons. It is a manifestation of human work\nand action. Arendt\u2019s political theory, rooted in the real, lived experiences of human\nbeings, contributes to a constructivist methodological shift. It also places the\npluralism of states within the context of the diversity of people and communities.\nHopes for universalism must stem from the interaction of individuals rooted in\ncommunities central to their identity and to their political motivations. These\ncommunities are social constructs, but remain central to the everyday operation of\npolitics, including, and perhaps especially, the politics of hatred and conflict.\nDiscourse and interaction, not humanity, links people together: \u2018For the world is\nnot humane just because it is made by human beings, and it does not become\nhumane just because the human voice sounds within it, but only when it has become\nthe object of discourse\u2019.75 The space in-between individuals, communities and\ninstitutions is where discourse can take place, where identities can meet, generating\ngenuine humanity.\nThis space in-between is delicate, transitory, ephemeral and intersubjective, con-\ntrasting with the resilient, durable, institutionalised view of international society that\nTerritorial borders, toleration and the English School 751\n72 Arendt, Human Condition, pp. 182\u20133.\n73 Ibid., pp. 28\u201350. See also Parekh, Hannah Arendt and the Search for a New Political Philosophy, pp.\n14\u201319.\n74 Arendt, \u2018On Humanity in Dark Times\u2019, p. 4.\n75 Ibid., p. 24.\nfor Jackson limits diversity, channelling interaction through the mechanisms of\ndiplomacy, limiting participation in \u2018real\u2019 international politics to a tiny minority.76\nArendt reopens the channel between people and international society, enabling the\nvictims of power to be heard, as well as its holders, helping a pluralist English\nSchool agenda follow constructivist solidarism\u2019s recognition of this need.\nAn Arendtian approach requires that we return to the world sedimented and\nreified institutions of international society like territorial borders. We can do this by\nviewing them as devices for creating a space in-between, rather than treating them as\nperimeter fences maintained and policed by a small political, diplomatic and military\nelite.77 Borders have served to close off separate worlds. Within states one form of\npolitics takes place, amongst them exists a distinctive political arena where different\nrules apply. Returning these worlds to a human politics of diversity requires\nconstant questioning of their legitimacy and role, including of the devices that\nseparate them. This occurs via active political involvement through the discourse of\nreal individuals and communities, not by judgement against either abstract absolute\nstandards or an elitist monolith of diplomatic custom and practice.78 This reaffirms\nthat the finer details of a politico-juridical, rather than sociological, concept of\nborders as being the correct one for international relations is undermined by their\nmuddling and mixing in practice and discourse.\nArendt berates the shutting off of political space in modern politics. Classical\npluralism does just this ostensibly to protect diversity via a toleration importantly\ninfluenced by liberalism. However, Arendt argues that liberalism is \u2018unworldly\u2019\nbecause its distinction between a public, political sphere and a private, apolitical\nsphere removes vast quantities of human interaction, and hopefully discourse, from\nconsideration as political.79 This un-worldliness infects liberalism\u2019s approach to\ntoleration. For Arendt, the realm of the political\u2014the realm of the worldly\u2014is\ninfinitely wider and lacks a teleology and moral ontology of individuality such as\nMill\u2019s. We need to recognise and engage the political aspects of almost all human\nactivity, including that we abhor.\nArendt\u2019s toleration is much greater than Mill and other liberals offer. She\nrecognises that hatred, prejudice and conflict matter to individuals and their com-\nmunities. These forces are significant in a worldly politics. This politics occurs in-\nbetween individuals, their communities and institutions. Genuine discourse involves\nhearing and considering these voices\u2014not declaring ourselves abstract, individual\nmembers of humanity to whom such things are a false consciousness, or irrational,\nor abhorrent, making consideration unnecessary.\nRecognising these negative forces in politics gives us a reason to tolerate them\u2014\nthey are as important to the human experience as commitments to equality, liberty\nand justice\u2014and their place requires recognition. Understanding, interaction,\ndialogue and a recognition of human weakness as well as heroism are essential to a\nworldliness recognising the space in-between human beings, their communities and\ninstitutions as the site of politics. This supports pluralist international society as a\n752 John Williams\n76 Jackson argues that \u2018there are fewer than 20,000 people worldwide who are the primary subjects of\ninternational ethics\u2019 and of these maybe only 1,000 matter. Global Covenant, p. 134.\n77 Jackson uses the border as fence metaphor, The Global Covenant, p. 319.\n78 For Arendt\u2019s account of politics as action, see Human Condition, pp. 175\u2013247.\n79 Hansen, Hannah Arendt, pp. 89\u2013128.\nframework potentially conducive to this kind of politics and its richer version of\ntoleration. Here borders are acceptable but negotiable devices, protecting com-\nmunities and maintaining a space in-between for discourse: an arena of toleration.\nBoundaries and borders are inescapable and desirable in a world of diversity and\ncommunity. Given the current configuration of international politics, territorial\nborders are inescapable within international society. They may also be desirable if\nreturned to a worldly politics, seeing them as historically contingent devices for\ncreating space in-between some of the communities that characterise the diversity of\nhuman life, helping them resist totalising and homogenising projects.\nThis approach certainly challenges the understanding of borders in English\nSchool thinking, classical or constructivist. For Bull and other \u2018classicals\u2019, borders\nare \u2018facts\u2019 and thus largely unpolitical. They exist and they have to be taken into\naccount. The rules and norms that have built up around them may be political, but\ninternational relations will always have to address the issue of borders, even if the\nexact location of them changes, because without borders there could be no\ninternational society, or even an international system.80 With constructivism, borders\nare social facts: important, but deeply political and with serious ethical implications.\nHowever, those using constructivism for solidarist purposes portray respecting\nborders as a prudential or contingent matter, with ethical significance derivative\nfrom a wider agenda such as cosmopolitan human rights.\nAn Arendtian approach sees borders as elements of community and as ways of\ndividing and dissipating institutional power, accepting the difficulty of maintaining\nclear definitional lines in an unpredictable and dynamic human political environ-\nment. Borders can be vital in resisting \u2018ruling\u2019 and preserving a politics that\nrecognises, cherishes and sustains human diversity. However, this must not repeat the\nsedimentation and reification of borders\u2014they must remain constantly questioned\nin response to the unpredictable, ephemeral workings of an intersubjective politics of\ndiscourse.81 They do, though, act as limits, including helping us to place limits on\ntoleration.\nArendt is deeply concerned with limits in politics, stemming partly from her\nrecognition that civilisation is neither inevitable or even terribly secure from human\nhubris and the tendency of human-introduced trends to run out of control.82\nTerritorial borders are one form of limitation in politics, the diversity they help\nprotect is another and the idea of toleration is a third. These are far from the only\nones, but are the most important in relation to an account of the English School.\nTerritorial borders as historical, intellectual and social constructions matter because\nthey help divide political authority and military might, fitting with the English\nSchool\u2019s concerns over universal empire and other totalising projects. Borders establish\nlimits which, if protected and accepted, rob totalitarianism of its dynamism and the\npolitical tactic of \u2018permanent revolution\u2019 through which it is able to galvanise support,\nsweeping away prior political forms.83 However, borders remain rooted in the dynamic,\nTerritorial borders, toleration and the English School 753\n80 Jackson, Global Covenant, pp. 316\u201335.\n81 The struggle to maintain freedom in politics is the central theme of Hannah Arendt, On Revolution\n(London: Faber and Faber, 1963).\n82 Margaret Canovan, \u2018Hannah Arendt as a Conservative Thinker\u2019, in Larry May and Jerome Kohn\n(eds.), Hannah Arendt: Twenty Years Later (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1996), pp. 14\u201321.\n83 Arendt, Origins of Totalitarianism, pp. 389, 391.\nunpredictable and evolutionary politics of real communities, changing to reflect\ndevelopments in these communities.\nIn addition, the rules, norms and principles of the territorially based international\nsociety further limit the ability of states to wield the single most important threat to\ntoleration and a worldly politics, violent military might. Territorial borders are mut-\nable constitutive rules, as a constructivist English School must accept, and Arendt\noffers useful tools for delving into the sediment and challenging the reification of\nterritorial borders by reassessing their roles and purposes, even if she herself offers\nlittle direct reflection on this.\nArendt can give us good reasons to tolerate what we morally condemn and can\nhelp us place territorial borders back into the political world in a positive way.\nTolerating what we morally condemn is right because such things are part of a\nproperly political, worldly, process, engaging people and creating opportunities for\ndiscourse to develop. This is what toleration should be about, rather than forbearing\nthings made presently unalterable by circumstances or prudential considerations.\nThe risks are familiar\u2014granting platforms to extremists, racists, bigots and the\nwhole panoply of derogatory language applied to those expressing views we find\noffensive. This price must be paid, not because we cannot change such people\u2019s\nviews, as Locke might argue, but because such views are part of political discourse\nand dialogue.84 Territorial borders can hold open discursive space and a principle\nlike non-intervention can be more than a prudential rule in the face of anarchy.\nBorders are protective and constitutive of community. For a modified pluralist\nEnglish School theory, order in diversity ought to be just as important as order\nunder anarchy. If diversity is ethically desirable then this offers a way of avoiding the\n\u2018second best\u2019 conclusions about international society being a solution fit only for a\nnon-ideal world.\nToleration, however, is not absolute. If we have good reason to be tolerant, this\ndoes not mean nothing is intolerable. In effect, the violent refusal to reciprocate\ntoleration is intolerable. Territorial borders can be thought of as ways in which\naccess to political space is partially, if inadequately, pluralised via the division of\npolitical authority and military might. This is a two-edged sword, of course. The\ndenial of reciprocal toleration often takes the form of state repression, and when it\ndoes, it is at its most severe. Where repression is by state armed force a response by\nother states is required to restore reciprocal toleration. \u2018Political equality requires a\nminimum threshold: that all must have access to the public world\u2019.85 Thus Arendt\ndefended Eichmann\u2019s right to be heard at his trial, eventually supporting the death\npenalty because Eichmann denied the Jews\u2019 right to exist and participate.86 Claims\nto universal moral status by prevalent political views must be challenged if\nprevalence is not to result in violently enforced universalism.87\n754 John Williams\n84 Arendt was criticised for opposing forcible school integration, arguing this went beyond protecting\nConstitutional rights and imposed social uniformity. It was thus intolerant.

These are as good reasons as human rights for intervention in\nthe face of grave human suffering, for example, because they encompass and value\nthe discourse of human rights. However, this Arendtian justification may be more\npolitically acceptable because it does not privilege an abstract justification incompat-\nible with other important versions of the moral agency of human beings. An\nArendtian approach deepens and enriches concerns that liberals share over the non-\nreciprocity of toleration, taking what in many ways is a distinctly liberal argument\nand situating it in a discourse that is essential to meaningfulness and a sense of\nreality in human affairs. It thus addresses the problematic, abstract nature of human\nrights and other universal principles prominent in contemporary solidarism.\nArendt helps us take more seriously the politics of the \u2018humanitarian\u2019 part of\nhumanitarian intervention. The apolitical, charitable, neutral and impartial idea\nassociated with the Red Cross, often assumed in many discussions of humanitarian\nintervention, is not conceptually all-encompassing. Being human, and therefore the\npotential for humanitarianism, is about creating access to political space via\nengagement with and opening oneself to diversity. An unpredictability about politics\nand the outcomes of action makes institutional blueprints inappropriate. No \u2018one-\nsize-fits-all\u2019 policy of humanitarian intervention is suitable for situations as different\nas Kosovo, Chechnya and Rwanda, for example. Universal requirements for political\naccess, respect for community and toleration of diversity enable lines to be drawn in\nthe sand, though. International society contributes to this via specific understand-\nings of territorial borders and principles such as the non-use of force except in self-\ndefence, territorial integrity and non-intervention. These should be overridden when\nstate authorities\u2014those charged with respecting diversity internationally and granted\nrights and privileges domestically by membership of international society\u2014or those\naspiring to state authority, systematically and violently deny a community access to\npolitical space or attempt its eradication. This threatens international peace and\nsecurity\u2014order in international society\u2014and the basis, even the possibility, of\nproperly human politics that values, protects, respects and engages with diversity;\nthat tolerates diversity and makes toleration a political virtue.\nAddressing intolerance, including but not limited to intervention, must not itself\nbe intolerant. Restoring access to political space, including restoring international\npeace and security, is the goal, not prescribing forms and institutions for an open\npolitical space. This access should include access to international society, establish-\ning channels between individuals, communities and the international system. The\nneed for intervention is a sign of international society\u2019s failure. Efforts to address\nsuch situations should not stop at the territorial borders of the state or states\nintervened into, but should evolve international society as part of an orderly system\nin conditions of anarchy and diversity. This is not to reify or embalm international\nsociety, isolating it from political crises within it. Its existence contributes to these\ncrises, and their management, and above all their resolution, challenges international\nsociety\u2019s effectiveness and responsiveness. Thus prudence, circumspection and a\nconcern to incorporate into putative rights of humanitarian intervention some of\nthe classic limiting principles of the Just War tradition\u2014proportionality, last resort,\nlegitimate authority, reasonable prospects of success\u2014are important because they\nTerritorial borders, toleration and the English School 755\nprotect international society.88 However, when circumstances require and enable the\nbuilding of a more tolerant and human politics in diversity then these principles\nshould be reconsidered and occasionally put aside, returning them to a worldly and\nengaged politics. Territorial borders, as features of international society, are thus\nethically contingent, but not against cosmopolitan standards such as human rights,\nbut against their contribution to a tolerant worldly politics of diversity where the\npolitically mute but otherwise loud voice of violence is heard less often.\nThe power and persuasiveness of a constructivist English School theory to rein-\nvigorate a solidarist agenda has shifted the School\u2019s ethical focus. The opportunity\nto move away from a \u2018second best\u2019 position\u2014that an international society is the best\nthat can be hoped for until anarchy and diversity can be overcome as blockages to a\nworld society\u2014must be fully explored. Yet, abandoning the pluralist ethical agenda\nmay be premature. In relation to territorial borders, and possibly other \u2018pluralist\u2019\nfeatures of the international system, an ethic of toleration offers a fruitful line of\nenquiry.\nConclusion\u2014toleration and the English School\nThis account of the status of territorial borders and of their potential to act as part\nof a system of toleration in international society, although of an Arendtian rather\nthan liberal kind, has hinted at the depth of issues surrounding this question.\nTreating borders as constitutive rules and thus as live political questions, particularly\nvia a constructivist methodological turn, has posed some difficult ethical questions.\nA more wide-ranging treatment of the issue of borders than is possible here would\nsurely throw up equally difficult questions in relation to a number of other issues.\nThis article has tried to make an argument that there may be good ethical reasons\nfor granting weight to territorial borders and the kinds of rules and principles of\ninternational society that cluster around them. However, this does require a sub-\nstantial shift in the way in which those arguments have traditionally been made.\nThere is a need to focus on order in diversity as being equally important as order in\nanarchy. Equally, it also requires a revitalised pluralist ethical agenda within the\nEnglish School, but not one that treats states as being the automatic manifestations\nof community. The growing diversity of the agenda and actors of international\nrelations, in terms of both policy and theory, has made assumptions about states as\nhomogeneous communities unsustainable.89 There is a need within pluralism as well\nas solidarism to consider the victims of power, not just its holders, and to open the\nchannel between \u2018domestic\u2019 politics and international society.\nAchieving, or even approximating, this task of offering a positive defence of\nterritorial borders requires a more focused approach, stressing toleration and the\nrole of territorial borders as restraints on the use of force. Classical English School\ntheory sees this restraint as operating at the level of interstate relations as a way of\nprotecting states from the imposition of external despotism. Hence the emphasis on\n756 John Williams\n88 Wheeler, Saving Strangers, ch. 2.\n89 John Williams, \u2018The Ethics of Borders and the Borders of Ethics: International Society and Rights\nand Duties of Special Beneficence\u2019, Global Society, 13:4 (1999).\nlegitimate force as being in self-defence and the duty of states to ensure the per-\npetuation of international society itself.\nHowever, this risks granting too free a licence to internal repression. It is this\ndanger that causes constructivist English School approaches to see an opportunity\nto refocus the ethical agenda on solidarism. This substantially reduces the ethical\nstatus of territorial borders to being prudential or circumstantial, derivative from\nsuperior cosmopolitan ethical principles, although they remain important in practice\nand via their role in generating order amongst states.\nThis article has tried to suggest that territorial borders, via an idea of toleration,\ncan be useful at both levels. Territorial borders and the rules clustering around them\ncan continue to restrain drives to universal empire or other external despotism whilst\nalso serving a function in resisting internal repression. With a concentration on\nrestraining violence, and recast in terms of toleration as discussed here, the ethics of\nterritorial borders can be refined. If non-reciprocity of toleration is intolerable, this\nsanctions a limited weakening of the non-intervention principle that is so tied up\nwith territorial borders. Borders ought to be respected in the interests of toleration\nup to the point that activities within those borders cross the non-reciprocity line.\nThen outsiders may have the right to intervene to restore reciprocity, particularly if\nthe armed force of the state is being used. This adds to the idea of threats to\ninternational peace and security providing a justification for intervention but\nwithout wholesale removal of the non-intervention principle. It also removes the\nneed to redefine or interpret the international peace and security formula in ever\nmore inventive ways. The ethos here is not of borders being used to protect or\nenshrine a right to cultural closure, as is arguably the position of Walzer, but instead\nis about borders helping to protect the right to participate in politics and to be\ntolerated in the full meaning of that term.90\nAn appeal to the importance of diversity and plurality of community member-\nship enables us to downplay the centrality of territorial borders but without wiping\nout their significance and ethical importance. The role of international society is\nmore concentrated upon restricting the tendency of states to use their claims to the\nmonopoly of military might to crush diversity and display intolerance. This marks a\nmove away from classical English School thinking which emphasises the need to\nprotect the state; instead, international society ought also to be about protecting\nnon-state based communities from the intolerance of states and their dominant\npolitical elites.\nToleration thus gives us a reason to respect the rules, norms and principles of\ninternational society, but also a reason to limit its importance. It is partially con-\nstitutive of a desirable diversity of human societies and because it offers the\npotential operational principle of toleration in the conduct of states that both\ncontribute to and threaten diversity. This form of toleration, based on the approach\nto politics of Arendt, argues for reciprocal toleration in an open, pluralistic and\npopular politics rooted in the lived experience, in all its diversity, of people. This is\nseen as being the only way to produce and reproduce community and meaning, and\nto act in a properly political manner. International society has the potential to frame\nTerritorial borders, toleration and the English School 757\n90 Michael Walzer, Spheres of Justice: A Defence of Pluralism and Equality (Oxford: Martin Robertson,\n1983).\nsuch a politics in the realm of interstate relations and to protect toleration by\nhelping us identify the intolerant and by retaining the coercive force occasionally\nnecessary to resist the intolerant.\nInternational society has the potential to be the framing arrangements that act as\nan arena of compromise in international relations attracting, as Bull and Watson\u2019s\ndefinition points out, a recognition of the common interest in its maintenance, but\nwhich does not require a commitment to particular policies.91 Instead there is a\ncommitment, \u2018to the rules and institutions that make public freedom possible as well\nas the limits on political power that allow for plurality\u2019.92\nA defence of international society does not have to result in conservatism and a\ndefence of sovereignty, non-intervention and the rights of states over the rights of\npeople and peoples. The potential for a transformative pluralist project in English\nSchool theory is immanent without having to declare that such can only spring from\nthe solidarist wing. If we value diversity and recognise its importance, then it is\npossible that a politics of toleration, framed by international society, offers a vibrant\nnormative agenda which respects and protects that diversity of history, community,\nand understanding of the world that helps us know who, as well as what, we are.\nPotentially available is a politics of responsiveness to diverse others via an incessant\ndiscourse about how to understand and to act in the world that we have so largely\ncreated. It can enable us to protect it from intolerance, violent repression and a\ndenial of the role of difference in creating meaning for human life.\n758 John Williams\n91 \u2018By an international society we mean a group of states (or, more generally, a group of independent\npolitical communities) which not merely form a system, in the sense that the behaviour of each is a\nnecessary factor in the calculations of the others, but also have established by dialogue and consent\ncommon rules and institutions for the conduct of their relations, and recognize their common interest in\nmaintaining these arrangements\u2019.
