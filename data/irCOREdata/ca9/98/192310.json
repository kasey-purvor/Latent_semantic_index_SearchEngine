However, to \ndate, MIMO research has focussed primarily on communications within the VHF, UHF and SHF bands (and \nabove). Very little experimental or modelling research has been conducted in the area of exploiting MIMO \ntechniques within the HF radio band. This paper describes some of the preliminary experimental work that has \nbeen carried out in order to investigate the feasibility of implementing MIMO techniques within the HF band. \n \nIntroduction \n \nAn HF (3-30 MHz) propagation path through the ionosphere is prone to extensive fading as a consequence of \nmultipath and multimode propagation [1] (the actual number of multipath components connecting a transmitter \nto a receiver depends on a number of factors such as the geometry of the radio link, the frequency of operation, \nthe time of day, season, geomagnetic activity and sunspot number). As such, it would seem that the use of HF \nsignals in a multi-element transmitter-receiver system would be an ideal candidate for the implementation of \nMIMO techniques. So far, however, apart from the research outlined in [2] and [3], very little experimental or \nmodelling research has been conducted in this area. This paper describes some of the novel experimental work \nthat has been carried out in order to investigate the feasibility of applying MIMO techniques within the HF band. \n \nExperimental Arrangement \n \nFor the investigations presented in this paper, a purpose-built multi-channel transmitter system and multi-\nchannel receiver system was implemented. The receiver site is located in Bruntingthorpe (Leicester), UK and the \ntransmitter site is located in Durham, UK giving a range of approximately 255 km (a map showing the locations \nof the transmitter and receiver sites is given in the left frame of Fig.1). Currently, the system has the capability of \ntransmitting on up to four antennas and receiving on up to eight antennas. In order to investigate the effects of \nantenna heterogeneity at the transmitter, a variety of antennas were used in the campaigns (e.g. vertical, loop, \ndipole and crossed wire antennas). At the receiver, a spaced antenna array was employed so that the effect of \nantenna spacing could be determined. Specifically, an L-shaped array of five vertical monopole antennas (whips) \nwas utilised in all the campaigns. As illustrated in the right frame of Fig. 1, the array consisted of a 40 m long N-\nS arm (pointing in the general direction of Durham) and a 40 m long E-W arm. Therefore, the two orthogonal \narms of this configuration also facilitated the examination of any orientation-dependent propagation effects. \nFinally, in some of the campaigns, additional antennas (e.g. loop and crossed wires) were also utilised to \nintroduce heterogeneity at the receiver (Fig.1, right frame). Concurrent measurements of the amplitude of CW \nsignals received from the various transmitting antennas in Durham were made at each of the receiving antennas. \n \nMeasurements and Analysis \n \nBetween September and October 2007, a number of campaigns were performed over the Durham-\nBruntingthorpe radio path. The following sub-sections provide examples of two cases in which different MIMO \nconfigurations were employed. In both campaigns, data was collected over a period of approximately 1-2 hours, \nand the specific examples presented in each sub-section are representative of majority of the measurements.  \n \nFor the various transmit antennas, slightly different frequencies (offset by 10-20 Hz) were used. During testing, \nit was verified that the different frequencies exhibited correlated fading when transmitted simultaneously on a \nsingle antenna. This result confirmed that the differences in frequencies (when used on separate transmit \nantennas) would not contribute to any kind of de-correlation during the MIMO campaigns. \n \nN \nVertical  \nmonopole 1 \nVertical  \nmonopole 2 \nVertical  \nmonopole 3 \nVertical  \nmonopole 4 \nVertical  \nmonopole 5 \nLoop  \nantenna \nCrossed wire\nantenna \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig.1: (Left) Map of UK depicting the locations of the transmitter and receiver sites, and the Chilton ionosonde. (Right) The \nrelative positions of the antennas employed in the receiving antenna array in Bruntingthorpe. \n \nExample-1: 4 x 5 MIMO Configuration (17 October 2007 at 15:43 UT) \n \nFor the measurements described in this example, a 4 x 5 MIMO configuration was utilised. For the transmit \narray, four different transmit antennas (vertical (TX-1): 5.255010 MHz, loop (TX-2): 5.255020 MHz, N-S \ncrossed wire (TX-3): 5.255030 MHz and E-W crossed wire (TX-4): 5.255040 MHz) were utilised, while for the \nreceive array, the L-shaped configuration of five vertical monopoles (Fig.1, right frame) was employed. \n \nAs an example, the amplitude (linear units) pattern across two of the five monopoles of the L-shaped array for \nCW signals received from Durham for a period of approximately one minute (at 15:43 UT on 17 October 2007) \nis depicted in Fig. 2. Deep fading is observed on each of the receiving antennas for all four transmissions, \nindicative of the presence of a number of multipath components. Indeed, when transmission curves were \nsuperimposed on the corresponding vertical ionogram obtained from the Chilton ionosonde (location shown in \nFig.1, left frame), the presence of multiple propagation modes was confirmed: in addition to the 1F2, 2F2 and \n3F2 modes, both the ordinary and extraordinary modes were present. The magnitudes of the amplitude \ncorrelation coefficients between the individual transmissions at each of the receiving monopole antennas are \nlisted in Table 1. The values do not exceed approximately 0.85 suggesting adequate levels of de-correlation \n(according to [4], for a 10-element uniform linear array, the MIMO channel capacity does not degrade \nsignificantly until the inter-element correlation coefficient exceeds approximately 0.9). \n \nThe resultant correlation coefficients computed for various antenna pair spacings in this example are depicted in \nthe left frame of Fig.3. In order to identify orientation-dependent fading effects, the data from each transmitter \n(indicated by the different colours) have been divided into two parts (indicated by the different symbols) \ndepending on the orientation of the particular antenna arm: N-S arm of L-shaped array (solid circles); E-W arm \nof L-shaped array (solid squares). Two effects are obvious from this graph. Firstly, the correlation coefficients \nbetween the different antennas are very high. Even at the maximum antenna spacing of 40 m, the values of \ncorrelation coefficient do not fall below 0.90. Secondly, there does not appear to be any direction-dependent \nbehaviour, with both orthogonal arms of the L-shaped array resulting in comparable values of correlation. \n \nThe results from the correlation analysis indicate that under the prevailing multipath conditions in the \nionosphere, on the one hand, the spatial distribution of antennas at the receiver is not contributing to any kind of \nde-correlation (and would therefore be ineffective for achieving a MIMO capacity gain). However, the spaced, \nheterogeneous nature of the antenna configuration (i.e. the \u2018antenna\u2019 diversity) employed at the transmitter is \nresulting in low values of correlation coefficient between the individual transmissions. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 2: Amplitude pattern observed on two channels of the 5-element L-shaped vertical monopole array at Bruntingthorpe for \nfour CW signals received from Durham for a period of approximately one minute (at 15:43 UT on 17 October 2007) \n[Legend: dark blue data: vertical TX antenna (5.255010 MHz), green data: loop TX antenna (5.255020 MHz), red data: N-S \ncrossed wire TX antenna (5.255030 MHz), light blue data: E-W crossed wire TX antenna (5.255040 MHz)]. \n \nExample-2: 4 x 8 MIMO Configuration (02 November 2007 at 16:02 UT) \n \nIn this example, a 4 x 8 MIMO configuration was utilised. For the transmit array, two crossed wire antennas \nspaced approximately 22 m apart were employed with the following specifications: E-W arm of crossed wire 1 \n(TX-1): 5.255010 MHz, N-S arm of crossed wire 1 (TX-2): 5.255020 MHz, E-W arm of crossed wire 2 (TX-3): \n5.255030 MHz and E-W arm of crossed wire 2 (TX-4): 5.255040 MHz. The N-S arms of the two crossed wire \nantennas were oriented in such a way that they were pointing towards Bruntingthorpe (bearing=173\u00b0). For the \nreceive array, in addition to the L-shaped configuration of five vertical monopoles, a large square loop antenna \n(side length=1.5 m) and a crossed wire antenna were set up. The locations of the loop and crossed wire antennas \nrelative to the L-shaped array are shown in the right frame of Fig.1. The N-S arm of the receive crossed wire \nantenna was pointing in the direction of Durham. \n \nAs in the previous example, the amplitude pattern across the eight receiving antennas indicated deep fading for \nall four transmissions. The corresponding Chilton vertical ionogram-transmission curves plot showed the \npresence of multiple propagation modes. The existence of a strong E-region in the ionosphere gave rise to many \nmore modes (1E, 2E and 3E) in addition to the 1F2, 2F2 and 3F2 modes (and both the ordinary and \nextraordinary modes) that were observed in Example 1. The magnitudes of the amplitude correlation coefficients \nbetween the individual transmissions at each of the receiving antennas have been listed in Table 1. Expectedly, \nthe orthogonal arms of the transmit crossed wire antennas (i.e. the N-S and E-W arms) exhibit significantly \nlower levels of correlation compared to the parallel arms. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 3: The amplitude correlation coefficients computed for various antenna pair spacings of the L-shaped vertical monopole \nantenna array for each of the four transmissions: Example 1 (left frame) and Example 2 (right frame). The data have been \ndivided into two parts depending on the orientation of the particular antenna arm. \n \nThe plot of amplitude correlation coefficient vs. antenna spacing (Fig.3, right frame) for the L-shaped array \nindicates the occurrence a strong directional effect. Compared to the E-W arm, the correlation coefficients \nbetween different pairs of antennas in the N-S arm of the L-shaped array decrease much more rapidly with \nantenna separation. Specifically, at the maximum antenna spacing of 40 m, the values of correlation coefficient \nfor all four transmissions drop to as low as 0.30-0.60. This behaviour could be attributed to (a) the presence of \nmore propagation modes and\/or (b) the orthogonality at the transmit end and\/or (c) the fact that along the N-S \narm of the L-shaped array, the incoming radio waves would have to travel comparatively different distances \n(therefore resulting in more de-correlation) compared to the orthogonal E-W arm. Finally, the orthogonal nature \nof the receive crossed wire antenna also appears to have an implication on the levels of de-correlation achieved. \nIn particular, the correlation coefficients between the N-S and E-W arms are 0.49 (for TX-1), 0.56 (for TX-2), \n0.43 (for TX-3) and 0.50 (for TX-4).  \n \nTable 1: Amplitude correlation coefficients between the various transmissions at each receiving antenna.

As shown in this analysis, at HF \nwavelengths, the use of homogeneous spaced arrays will require significant spacing to achieve acceptable levels \nof de-correlation. Marked orientation-dependent effects have also been observed. Additionally, the prevailing \nstructure of the ionosphere and the number of multipath components that it can support has a major influence on \nthe MIMO performance. Looking to the future, the use of co-located heterogeneous antenna arrays will be \ninvestigated, which would enable the compact implementation of a HF-MIMO system by achieving the \nnecessary de-correlation at a single location. \n \nAcknowledgements \nThe authors are grateful to the EPSRC for their financial support of this work.
