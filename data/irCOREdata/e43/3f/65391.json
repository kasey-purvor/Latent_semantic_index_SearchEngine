This impaired grasping \nmight reflect a primary visuomotor deficit, or it might be a secondary effect arising \nfrom the spatial uncertainty associated with poor reaching. To distinguish between \nthese possibilities, we used a new paradigm to tease apart the proximal and distal \ncomponents of prehension movements. In the \u201cfar\u201d condition objects were placed 30 \ncm from the hand so that subjects had to make a reaching movement to grasp them, \nwhereas in the \u201cclose\u201d condition objects were placed adjacent to the hand, thereby \nremoving the need for a reaching movement. Stimulus eccentricity was held constant. \nWe tested a patient with optic ataxia (M.H.), whose misreaching affects only his right \nhand within the right visual hemifield. M.H. showed a clear impairment in grip \nscaling, but only when using his right hand to grasp objects in the right visual \nhemifield. Critically, this grip-scaling impairment was absent M.H. in the \u201cclose\u201d \ncondition. These data suggest that M.H.\u201fs grip scaling is impaired as a secondary \nconsequence of making inaccurate reaching movements, and not because of any \nintrinsic visuomotor impairment of grasping. We suggest that primary misgrasping is \nnot a core symptom of the optic ataxia syndrome, and that patients will show a \nprimary deficit only when their lesion extends anteriorly within the intraparietal \nsulcus to include area aIPS. \n \nKeywords: Grip, Reaching, Arm transport, Humans, Single case \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nCavina-Pratesi, C et al. \n \n 4 \nIntroduction \nIn a pioneering series of studies, Jeannerod (1984, 1988) proposed that reach-to-\ngrasp actions, such as picking up a desired object, can be partitioned into distinct and \nquasi-independent visuomotor parts. He argued that the action of moving the arm to \nbring the hand to the target object (the \u201cproximal\u201d or \u201ctransport\u201d component) is \nprincipally influenced by visual information signaling the location of the object, \nwhereas the concurrent anticipatory pre-shaping of the hand and fingers in readiness \nfor the grasp (the so-called \u201cdistal\u201d or \u201cgrip\u201d component) is guided principally by the \ngeometric properties of the object.  Although it is accepted that the two components \nmust be somehow mutually co-ordinated, there is now extensive evidence that the \ntransport component and the grip component are each controlled on-line by dedicated \nvisuomotor networks within the posterior parietal cortex, in association with linked \nsystems in the premotor cortex (Castiello, 2005; Castiello & Begliomini, 2008; \nJeannerod et al., 1995; Milner & Goodale, 2006; Tann\u00e9-Gari\u00e9py et al., 2002).  \nIt has long been known that both components of prehension can be severely \ndisrupted by lesions of the posterior parietal cortex. Damage to this region \n(particularly around the intraparietal sulcus) in humans is associated with optic ataxia \n(Perenin & Vighetto, 1988; Karnath & Perenin, 2005), classically defined as a deficit \nin accurate reaching for visual targets (B\u00e1lint 1909; Harvey 1995).  In the great \nmajority of patients with optic ataxia, grasping turns out to be impaired as well as \nreaching, and indeed patients will typically fumble for the target with the fingers \nwidely spread, whatever the size of the target (Jeannerod 1986; Perenin & Vighetto, \n1988, Jakobson et al., 1994).  This stands in sharp contrast to the normal pattern in \nwhich the handgrip opens only so far as to exceed the target size by a safe margin, and \nthen smoothly closes in (Jeannerod, 1984; Jakobson & Goodale, 1990). Such distal \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nImpaired grasping in a patient with optic ataxia \n 5 \nimpairments have been associated with optic ataxia since the earliest reports of \nmisreaching following parietal damage, in both monkeys and humans (Ferrier, 1886, \n1890; Lamotte & Acuna, 1978; Faugier-Grimaud et al., 1978; Damasio & Benton, \n1979; Jeannerod, 1986; Perenin & Vighetto, 1988). Indeed this close association \nbetween the distal and proximal deficits led Perenin and Vighetto (1983, 1988) to \nfollow B\u00e1lint (1909) in arguing that optic ataxia reflects a general impairment of \nvisuomotor control rather than a deficit in visuospatial perception (as proposed by \nHolmes, 1918). \nThere is of course no necessary contradiction between this neuropsychological \nassociation between the distal and proximal deficits, and the quasi-modular \nvisuomotor organization in the brain proposed by Jeannerod and his colleagues.  It is \nentirely reasonable to argue that in most of the patients (and monkeys) studied, the \nlesions were extensive enough to have compromised both the \u201cgrasping\u201d and the \n\u201creaching\u201d visuomotor modules.  None the less, the question does still arise as to \nwhether an impairment in grip scaling necessarily implies that the patient has damage \nto such a \u201cgrasping\u201d module.  Instead, optic ataxia, by virtue of causing inaccurate \nreaching, might inevitably result in a maximally wide handgrip, simply in order to \nreduce the margin of error when the patient is trying to grasp an object.  \nSuch an idea would not of course contradict the fact that some patients with \nparietal lesions mis-grasp without misreaching (Jeannerod et al., 1994; Binkofski et \nal., 1998). These patients, who would not be considered to have optic ataxia, tend to \nhave lesions that include anterior parts of the intraparietal sulcus, in particular the \n\u201cgrasp\u201d region known as AIP or aIPS (Binkofski et al., 1998). These findings are \nimportant, because they refute the argument that mis-grasping might always be a \nsecondary side-effect of misreaching. The data also mesh nicely with research using \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nCavina-Pratesi, C et al. \n \n 6 \nfunctional MRI which has demonstrated distinct activation patterns for grasping \n(Binkofsky et al., 1999; Culham et al., 2003; Frey et al., 2005; Cavina-Pratesi et al., \n2007), separate from those for reaching (Connolly et al., 2003; Astafiev et al., 2003; \nPrado et al., 2005, Culham et al., 2008). Complementary evidence also comes from \nnonhuman primate studies finding a clear double dissociation between proximal\/arm \nand distal\/hand errors following localized microinjections of muscimol (Gallese et al., \n1994).  \nAlthough misgrasping can clearly arise in the absence of misreaching, it remains \nuncertain that the converse dissociation holds true in patients with optic ataxia. That \nis, it remains possible that in many such patients impaired grasping arises purely as a \nsecondary consequence of misreaching, and not as the result of disruption of the \n\u201cgrasp\u201d module. \nFlesh can be put on the bones of these doubts.  Numerous visuomotor studies show \na tendency in healthy subjects to increase the size of their anticipatory grip aperture to \ncompensate for factors that increase transport inaccuracy during reaching toward the \nobject to be grasped. In one such study, maximum grip aperture (MGA) was found to \nbe significantly greater during reaching movements that were performed faster than \nnormal, and also during reaching with the eyes closed (Wing et al., 1986).  In both \ncases, this wider hand aperture was accompanied by less accurate transport of the \nhand toward the target location.  It is reasonable to infer that in these circumstances \nanticipatory grip aperture was enlarged to give a wider margin of error for achieving a \nsuccessful capture of the object, thereby compensating for the spatial inaccuracy \nassociated with speeded movements. Similar findings of an increased maximum grip \naperture during reaching have been reported in cases where the stimulus uncertainty is \nincreased in other ways, for example when visual target size is reduced (Berthier et al \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nImpaired grasping in a patient with optic ataxia \n 7 \n1996), when the field of view is restricted (Gonz\u00e1lez-Alvarez et al., 2007), or when \nthe target eccentricity is increased (Goodale & Murphy, 1997; Schlicht & Schrater, \n2007).   \nIn the present paper we aimed to test whether deficits in grip calibration can be \nseparated from deficits in reaching accuracy in optic ataxia, by the use of a task \nrequiring grasping without arm transport. Such a task was developed by Cavina-\nPratesi et al. (2006; see also Culham et al., 2008) in order to achieve a clean contrast \nbetween \u201epure grasping\u201f and \u201epure reaching\u201f in a functional MRI study1. We adopted \nthis methodology in the present experiment in an attempt to tease apart the transport \nfrom the grasp impairment in a patient with optic ataxia (M.H.). Our specific intention \nwas to establish whether his grasping difficulties were primary, or secondary to poor \nreaching; but at the same time we wished to validate our method so that it might be \nused for making unambiguous assessments of other such patients in the future.  \n \nMethods \nSubjects \nPatient M.H. had suffered an anoxic episode 8 years prior to the current testing. \nStructural MRI carried out in 2006 revealed disseminated damage in posterior parietal \nand frontal regions, concentrated particularly in the vicinity of the intra-parietal sulcus \nof the left hemisphere, with some extension onto the medial aspect and into the \ninferior parietal lobule. Some atrophy was visible in the left hemisphere both \ncortically (within the posterior parietal, fronto-temporal and frontal regions) and \nsubcortically (lentiform nucleus and claustrum).

(2003), for use in a different context. \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nCavina-Pratesi, C et al. \n \n 8 \nmuscle weakness and raised sensory thresholds. He was still able to walk and use both \nhands, though he reported difficulties in everyday living activities, such as dressing, \neating with a knife and fork, and writing. Clinical assessment exhibited symptoms of \ncontralateral optic ataxia, most clearly when using his right hand, and when reaching \ntoward targets in right hemispace under condition of central visual fixation (Rice et \nal., 2008). M.H also showed impairments in spatial perception (Riddoch et al., 2004), \nthough clinical assessment showed no evidence of unilateral spatial neglect or \nagraphia.  \nSomatosensory performance was assessed using the Rivermead Assessment tests \n(Winward, Halligan & Wade, 2000). MH scored at ceiling when discriminating \nsurface pressure on both his hands and face (control level); he also detected all \nbimanual and unimanual stimuli in the Rivermead test of sensory extinction applied \nboth to the face and the hands (tests 2 and 4). His two-point discrimination on each \nhand was 4mm (test 5), again within the control range. MH had a grating resolution \nthreshold of 2mm (fair, relative to a group of older controls, in Manning & Tremblay, \n2006), for both hands, on a task requiring him to decide whether a grating went along \nor across his finger (the threshold = minimum width to make 75% discriminations). \nMH was also able to discriminate the 2.83 filament (normal) on his ipsi- and \ncontralesional fingers on the Semmes-Weinstein monofilament test (Bell, 1984). \nThese data indicate that there was no major somatosensory loss in either hand. M.H. \nwas aged 50 at the time of testing.  \nIn addition to patient M.H., 7 age-matched neurologically intact controls were \ntested (all male; mean age 52.1, range 45 to 61). Since M.H. has essentially no \nreaching deficit when using his left hand, or towards targets in the left visual field \n(confirmed in the Results below), M.H. also served as his own control.  \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nImpaired grasping in a patient with optic ataxia \n 9 \nThe ethics committees of the University of Birmingham School of Psychology and \nDurham University Department of Psychology approved the experiments described \nhere, and informed consent was obtained prior to the study in accordance with the \nprinciples of the Declaration of Helsinki. \n \nProcedure \nSubjects sat comfortably in front of a 50 x 50 cm board laid horizontally on a \ntable. As shown in Figure 1, there were four possible locations where a target object \ncould be placed: two near and two distant from the participant, 30 cm apart on left and \nright, and forming a square arrangement such that the near locations were 30 cm from \nthe distant locations. A fixation point (a flashing red LED) was located at the centre of \nthe square. At the beginning of each trial, as indicated in Figure 1, the subject\u201fs left or \nright hand was placed adjacent to one of the potential object locations on a given side \nof the board (on the right side of the location when using the right hand and on the left \nside of the location when using the left hand). The starting position of the hand was \nspecified by the use of a small plastic disc (white dot in Figure 1) fixed to the board, \nat which the subject placed their pinched forefinger and thumb at the start of each \ntrial. The object was then placed on the same side of the board, either close to the \nhand or far from the hand. Placing the object at the location adjacent to the hand \nenabled subjects to grasp the object without making an arm movement (hereafter \nreferred to as the \u201cclose\u201d condition). Placing the object at the other location, however, \nrequired the subject to move his or her arm towards the object in order to complete the \ngrasp (\u201cfar\u201d condition).  \nAccording to the starting position used, the reaching movement would thus be \nperformed either by the use of an outward or an inward movement (see Figure 1). \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nCavina-Pratesi, C et al. \n \n 10 \nWhen the hand starting position was located near to the body, the movements would \nbe directed outwards, away from the body. Conversely, when the starting position was \nlocated distant from the body, the reach would be directed inwards, towards the body. \nThe use of both outward and inward reaches ensured that the retinal location of the \ntarget object (in either the upper or lower visual hemifield) was balanced across both \nclose and far prehension conditions.   \nTwo different objects were used, both of which were rectangular blocks made \nfrom 1-cm-thick black plastic. The two blocks had an identical top surface area, but \none was a 5-cm square whereas the other was a 3 cm x 8.3 cm oblong, placed with the \nlong axis in the fronto-parallel plane. Since subjects were asked to grasp the objects \nfront-to-back, the oblong block was designated the \u201csmall\u201d object and the square the \n\u201clarge\u201d object. The objects were located by means of specific signs on the \nexperimental board visible only to the experimenter, allowing a precise positioning of \nthe stimuli relative to the hand on every trial. Liquid crystal shutter glasses (Plato \nSystem, Translucent Technologies, Toronto, Canada) were used in order to control \nviewing time of the array. \n[Figure 1 about here] \nData were collected from the control subjects in two separate sessions (one for \neach hand). Within each session there were 8 blocks of trials: one for each \ncombination of stimulus side (left vs right), viewing condition (free viewing vs central \nfixation) and movement direction (outward vs inward). Within each block of trials, \nthe target object (small vs large) and the proximity of the hand to the object (close vs \nfar) were varied pseudo-randomly. Target hemispace and movement direction were \ncounterbalanced within the free viewing and central fixation sequences using an \nABBA design. Left\/right hand use and central-fixation\/free-viewing were balanced \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nImpaired grasping in a patient with optic ataxia \n 11 \nacross subjects. Patient M.H was also tested in two sessions. During session 1, M.H \nused his right hand while performing under conditions of both free viewing and \nfixation. During the second session, M.H. was tested with both his right hand and his \nleft hand, but under central fixation conditions only, in order to avoid excessively long \ntesting sessions. We thereby maximized data collection for the conditions of most \ninterest, namely M.H.\u201fs use of his right hand while maintaining fixation, given that \nthe previous session had revealed no impairments during reaching under free viewing \nconditions (see Results below). In addition, during the second session we checked \nM.H.\u201fs ability to discriminate visually between the two objects at all spatial locations \nwhile maintaining central fixation. \nAt the beginning of each trial the shutter glasses opened and after 2 s a tone \ninstructed the participant to pick up the object and place it over the central fixation \nposition.  Movements were performed entirely in visual closed loop (that is, with full \nvision of the hand). M.H.\u201fs fixation was monitored by a second experimenter on all \ntrials. Movements were recorded by sampling the position of three markers (on \nthumb, index finger and wrist) at a frequency of 86.1 Hz, using an electromagnetic \nmotion analysis system (Minibird, Ascension Technology Ltd). Each block was \ncomposed of 40 trials (10 for each object at each location \u2013 near and far). \n \nAnalysis of data \nData analysis was performed on the proximal (transport) component and the distal \n(grip) component separately.  \nWe first assessed performance on the reach component by analysing movement \nTransport Error (TE, in mm) which was measured as the Cartesian distance (mean \nabsolute distance, and variance of the absolute distance) between the landing position \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nCavina-Pratesi, C et al. \n \n 12 \nof the wrist marker and the target position. We defined the landing position (X and Y \ncoordinates) of the wrist as its location at the end of the ballistic part of the reach, \nsince after this point M.H. would often grope for the object in order to pick it up. The \nend of the ballistic movement was calculated as the moment at which the velocity of \nthe wrist marker fell below 50mm\/s. Although the transport movement toward the \nclose target was negligible, the small displacement of the wrist necessary to access the \nobjects and grasp them was clearly captured by the wrist marker, and was analyzed \nusing the same criteria as for the transport to the far object.  \nThe grip component was analysed by measuring Maximum Grip Aperture (MGA), \ncomputed as the maximum distance in 3D space between index and thumb markers \nduring the ballistic part of the movement. Other measures of transport (movement \ntime, peak velocity and time to peak velocity) and grip (time to MGA) kinematics \nwere also analyzed (and can be accessed by contacting the first author), but are not \nreported here because they are not relevant to the current experimental question.  \nThe data from the controls and from patient M.H. were analyzed separately using \nANOVA statistics in order to examine how the experimental manipulations affected \nthe transport and the grip components within each group. Data from the controls were \nanalyzed using repeated-measures ANOVAs where Viewing Condition (free vs \nfixation), Hand (left vs right), Space (left vs right), Movement direction (inward vs \noutward), Distance (close vs far) and Size (large vs small object) were used as within-\nsubjects factors. Post-hoc analyses were performed by using corrected paired \ncomparison t-tests, and reported wherever significant at p<0.05. Data from patient \nM.H. were analyzed using two 5-way factorial ANOVAs. First we examined his \nperformance with the right hand only, during the two different viewing conditions, \nusing as factors: Viewing Condition (free vs fixation), Space (left vs right), \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nImpaired grasping in a patient with optic ataxia \n 13 \nMovement direction (inward vs outward), Distance (close vs far) and Size (large vs \nsmall object). In the second analysis we tested M.H.\u201fs performance during central \nfixation only, using both right and left hands, with the factors: Hand (left vs right), \nSpace (left vs right), Movement direction (inward vs outward), Distance (close and \nfar) and Size (large and small object).  \nFinally, we adopted the modified t-test recommended by Crawford and Garthwaite \n(2002, 2004), to assess whether M.H.\u201fs performance was significantly different from \nthe controls. In order to be concise we report here the significant results only. \n \nResults \nNeurologically intact participants \nTransport component  \nAnalysis of the mean reaching error (TE) revealed a significant interaction of \nViewing Condition x Distance (F(1,6)=10.90, p=0.016) with the mean TE for the far \nreaches being higher (9.82 mm) than for close ones (8.99 mm) during central fixation \nonly. Analysis of the variability of TE showed a significant main effect of Movement \ndirection (F(1,6)=11.96, p=0.014) with inward movements (22.4) being less variable \nthan outward (27.6) ones. In addition, an interaction of Hand x Space (F(1,6)=6.31, \np=0.046) showed that ipsilateral movements (left hand: 28.9, right hand: 27.2) \nresulted in higher variance (28.3) than contralateral ones (left hand: 24.8; right hand: \n19.2).   \n \nGrip component  \nAnalysis of MGA revealed significant main effects of Viewing Condition \n(F(1,6)=71.8, p=0.0001; fixation: 99.2 mm; free viewing: 90.6 mm) and Size \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nCavina-Pratesi, C et al. \n \n 14 \n(F(1,6)=431.27, p=0.0001; large object: 103.7 mm, small object: 86.7 mm). An \ninteraction of Viewing Condition x Size (F(1,6)=13.5, p=0.01) reflected a larger \ndifference in MGA for large than for small objects during central fixation only \n(central fixation: large object=107.9 mm, small object=91.5; free viewing: large \nobject= 99.5 mm and small object=81.7 mm).  \n \nOverall, these control data show that TE is greater and more variable under \nconditions of fixation and when the objects are located far from the start point, \nthereby requiring arm transport. Likewise, MGA (and its size scaling) was larger \nwhen the subjects were asked to fixate centrally. This may reflect greater spatial \nuncertainty for actions executed under these conditions, given previous reports that \nlarger MGA is associated with increased transport error prior to contact (Wing et al., \n1986).   \n \nPatient M.H. \nVisual discrimination \nAt the beginning of session 2, we asked patient M.H. to visually identify the two \nobjects at each of the four possible object locations while maintaining central fixation. \nThe objects were presented following the same sequence as used for visuomotor \ntesting, and the patient was asked to name each object immediately after the opening \nof the shutter glasses. M.H.\u201fs overall accuracy was very high, with only 1 error (=95% \naccuracy) being made at each location within each hemifield.  \n \nTransport component  \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nImpaired grasping in a patient with optic ataxia \n 15 \nFigure 2 shows the landing position results for M.H. and for the age-matched \ncontrol subject (I.D.) separately for inward and outward reaches. Analysis of M.H.\u201fs \nreaching error (TE) was computed on a trial by trial basis, therefore ANOVAs could \nonly be carried out on the mean TE scores. The variability of TE (calculated as the \nvariance of the trial by trial TE scores and therefore represented by a single value for \neach experimental condition) was analysed only by the use of Crawford and \nGarthwaite\u201fs (2002) modified t-test. \n[Insert figure 2 about here] \nWe first analyzed M.H.\u201fs right hand performance alone, using Viewing Condition, \nSpace, Movement Direction, Distance and Size as factors. We found main effects of \nViewing Condition (F(1,279)=97.23, p=0.0001), Space (F(1,279)=98.00, p=0.0001). \nMovement direction (F(1,279)=15.30, p=0.0001) and Distance (F(1,279)=67.50, p=0.007). \nTE was greater under fixation conditions (free viewing=9.2 mm, fixation=20.7 mm); \nin right hemispace (left=9.3 mm, right=20.8); for outward reaches (inward reach=12.7 \nmm; outward =17.3 mm); and for far distances (close=10.2mm, far=19.8mm). \nConsistent with our expectations, a significant 3-way interaction of Viewing \nCondition x Space x Distance (F(1,187)=4.05, p=0.04) was found, reflecting the fact that \nerrors were greatest for actions while fixating centrally, made to far target objects \nwithin right hemispace (see Figure 2, red versus green diamonds, and Figure 3, black \nbars).  \nIn a second factorial ANOVA, we analysed the fixation data only, using Hand, \nSpace, Movement direction, Distance and Size as factors. We found main effects of \nHand (F(1,270)=5.70, p=0.018), Space (F(1,270)=93.98, p=0.0001), Movement direction \n(F(1,270)=52.2, p=0.0001), and Distance (F(1,270)=48.9, p=0.0001). TE was greater for \nthe right hand (left =11.7 mm, right =20.8 mm), within right hemispace (left =10.2 \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nCavina-Pratesi, C et al. \n \n 16 \nmm, right =22.3 mm), for outward movements (inward: 14.8 mm; outward: 17.7 mm), \nand for far reaches (close =11.9 mm, far =20.6 mm). Most importantly, there was a \nthree-way interaction of Hand x Space x Distance (F(1,270)=54.7, p=0.0001) reflecting \nthe fact that TE was highest for far reaches, made with the right hand, within right \nhemispace (see Figure 2, red versus yellow diamonds and Figure 3, black bars). \nLastly, a four-way interaction of Hand x Space x Reaching direction x Distance \nreached significance (F(1,270)=6.2, p=0.014), reflecting the fact that the transport error \nfor far-amplitude right-hand actions within right space was higher for outward than \nfor inward reaches (see Figure 3, black bars). \n[Insert figure 3 about here] \nAs shown in Figure 3, only M.H.\u201fs far reaches, executed under central fixation and \nusing his right hand, were found to be significantly different from the control group \n(t=13.48, p=0.0001 for the outward reaches and t=4.68, p=0.003 for the inward \nreaches, with an estimated 100% and 99.83% of the normal population falling below \nM.H.\u201fs score, respectively). The same analysis was performed for the variance of TE \n(see Figure 4), and again we found a significant difference for M.H.\u201fs actions when he \nmade far reaches, with his right hand, within right space (t=78.29, p=0.0001 for \noutward reaches and t=52.16, p=0.0001 for inward reaches, both with an estimated \n100 % of the normal population falling below M.H.\u201fs score). Unlike his mean TE, \nM.H.\u201fs variance of TE was significantly different from that of controls when he made \nclose movements with his right hand in right space (t=7.25, p=0.0001 for outward \nreaches and t=8.71, p=0.0001 for inward reaches, both with an estimated 99.98% of \nthe normal population falling below M.H.\u201fs score). The amount of scatter around the \nreference point for such close actions \u2013 made with the right hand within right space \nduring central fixation \u2013 did not however exceed the spatial variability expected from \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nImpaired grasping in a patient with optic ataxia \n 17 \nthe fact that participants can grasp objects using a range of different landing positions \non the object. This spatial variability was computed graphically by using the largest \nvalue in length (8 cm) and depth (5 cm) of the two objects (Figure 4, dotted \nrectangles).  \n[Insert Figure 4 about here] \nThese results replicate previous findings showing that M.H.\u201fs reaching impairment \nis confined to right-hand actions directed at objects in his right visual hemifield (Rice \net al., 2008). Our data extend those previous results by showing that M.H.\u201fs pattern of \nreaching impairment is just the same within a reach-to-grasp task as in a pointing task. \nIn addition, our data show that M.H.\u201fs impairment is present for inward as well as \noutward movements.  It is however present \u2013 perhaps unsurprisingly \u2013 only when the \naction requires arm transport (i.e. when stimuli are presented far from the hand).  \n \nGrip component  \nAnalysis of the MGA in M.H. was computed on a trial by trial basis. We first \nanalyzed right-hand performance only, using Viewing Condition, Space, Movement \ndirection, Distance and Size as main factors. We found main effects of Viewing \nCondition (F(1,290)=126.2, p=0.0001), Space (F(1,290)=39.6, p=0.0001), Movement \ndirection (F(1,290)=6.4, p=0.012), Distance (F(1,290)=9.9, p=0.02) and Size \n(F(1,290)=279.3, p=0.0001). MGA was wider for the larger object (large=99.6 mm, \nsmall=87.8 mm), during central fixation (fixation=97.6 mm, free viewing=89.8 mm), \nfor stimuli in right space (right =95.9 mm, left =91.5 mm), for outward movements \n(inward=92.8 mm, outward= 94.6 mm), and for movements to objects far from the \nhand (far =94.8 mm, close =92.6 mm). Critically, the 4-way interaction of Viewing \nCondition x Space x Distance x Size (F(1,290)=5.5, p=0.02) was also significant.

This result is shown graphically in figure 5.  \n[Insert Figure 5 about here] \nNext, we analysed the fixation data alone \u2013 so that the factor \u201cSpace\u201d became \nequivalent to \u201cvisual hemifield\u201d \u2013 in separate 4-way ANOVAs for each hand. For the \nright hand, all the main factors proved significant, as before. More importantly, the 3-\nway interaction of Space x Distance x Size now reached significance (F(1,146)=6.6, \np=0.011), reflecting again the lack of difference in MGA for large vs small objects \nwhen far reaches were executed within the right hemifield (Figure 5).  As for the left \nhand, all the main effects except movement direction proved significant, and most \nimportantly we did not find a 3-way interaction of Space x Distance x Size \n(F(1,132)=2.5, p=0.115), confirming the fact that the lack of grip scaling for far reaches \nin the right hemifield was restricted to the right hand.  \nWe then checked whether the patient\u201fs grip calibration was different from that \nfound in the controls, using Crawford and Garthwaite\u201fs (2004) modified t-test. As \nillustrated in Figure 5 (middle panel), the slope of the function for far right-hand \nactions made towards targets in the right hemifield was significantly different from \nthose seen in the controls (t=-3.90 p=0.0018, with an estimated 99% of the normal \npopulation falling above M.H.\u201fs slope).  \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nImpaired grasping in a patient with optic ataxia \n 19 \nDiscussion \nOur aim in this study was to tease apart the reaching and grasping impairments in a \npatient with optic ataxia (M.H.), by varying the proximal and distal requirements of a \nprehensive action. We manipulated the proximal component (arm transport) by asking \nour participants to grasp objects either at a close location adjacent to the hand (arm \ntransport not required), or at a far location within reach of the hand but not \nimmediately adjacent to it (arm transport required). We manipulated the distal \ncomponent (grip aperture) by having participants grasp objects of two different \nwidths.  \nM.H. showed a reaching impairment (larger errors in both X and Y coordinates) \nwhen reaching to grasp objects using his right hand within right hemispace, under \nconditions of central fixation. In contrast he performed at a level of accuracy \ncomparable to the controls when using his right hand within the left space, and when \nusing his left hand within either side of space, under the same fixation conditions. No \nmisreaching was apparent when M.H. was allowed to view the stimulus freely and \nthus fixate it directly \u2013 in other words his misreaching was truly restricted to the right \nhand within the right visual hemifield (i.e. the right side of space when fixating \ncentrally). These reaching errors were, for obvious reasons, most prominent in the \n\u201efar\u201f condition, where arm transport was required. M.H.\u201fs pattern of specific \ncontralateral deficits related to the right hand and the right hemifield is fully \nconsistent with previous reaching data (Rice et al., 2008). We further extended those \nprevious observations by finding that M.H. showed an identical pattern of \ncontralateral inaccuracy, albeit less pronounced, when his movements were made \ninwards, towards the body, rather than outwards.  \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nCavina-Pratesi, C et al. \n \n 20 \nWe also found, as perhaps might be expected from the previous literature on optic \nataxia caused by unilateral lesions (Perenin & Vighetto, 1988; Rice et al., 2008), that \nM.H.\u201fs deficit in anticipatory hand shaping was closely coupled with his reaching \nerrors. That is, his grasping was poorly scaled under exactly those conditions where \nhe made reaching errors, namely when he executed right-handed actions toward far \nobjects in the right hemispace while fixating centrally. His handgrip was scaled well \nto object width in all of the other conditions; for example M.H.\u201fs grip scaling was \nalways normal when using his left hand, and always when free viewing was allowed. \nPerceptual testing was carried out to exclude the possibility that any lack of scaling \nseen during the experiment was due to a peripheral visual impairment per se: when \nasked verbally, M.H. proved able to distinguish the two objects accurately at all \nlocations. Although this perceptual task was very basic (assigning two objects \nbetween two categories), it was deemed sufficient to confirm the absence of any gross \nvisual deficit that might interfere with correct hand shaping while grasping in the \nperiphery. If the results of the lack of scaling during misreaching were due to a \ncompensatory enlargement of safety margins during grasping in order to overcome \nany degraded visual information in the periphery, then it is unclear why M.H. did not \napply the same strategy when asked to grasp the same objects when located close . \nFurthermore, Figure 5 demonstrates that MGA for close objects within the impaired \nright hemifield did not vary between central fixation and free viewing.  Finally, of \ncourse, the fact that there was no visuomotor deficit in this same retinal location when \nM.H. used his left hand also provides strong internal evidence against any peripheral \nvisual loss. \nOur critical finding was that under our \u201eclose\u201f conditions, M.H.\u201fs right-handed \ngrasps toward objects in the right hemifield were well scaled. This spared grasp \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nImpaired grasping in a patient with optic ataxia \n 21 \ncalibration could not have been due to the target object having been located in a \ndifferent part of the visual field for close and far testing.  Our fully balanced design, \nincorporating both inward and outward reaches, meant that the targets of close and far \nactions were matched for visual location across the experiment. \nIf the grip component of reaching-to-grasp movements were impaired in M.H. as a \nprimary visuomotor deficit, then it should have been impaired regardless of the \npresence or amplitude of the transport component. That is, M.H. should have shown \nequally poor grip scaling in both the \u201cclose\u201d and \u201cfar\u201d conditions of testing. Such an \noutcome would be expected, for example, if his brain damage extended to include the \nanterior portion of the intraparietal sulcus (aIPS), which is known from functional \nneuroimaging studies to be strongly activated during object grasping movements \n(Binkofski et al., 1999; Culham et al., 2003; Frey et al., 2005; Cavina-Pratesi et al., \n2007), even when no reaching movement is required (Cavina-Pratesi et al., 2006). \nInstead, our evidence indicates that M.H.\u201fs grasping impairment (i.e. his failure to \nscale his grip, and his tendency to grope for the object) is secondary to his reaching \nimpairment. Presumably M.H., wittingly or unwittingly, compensates for the direction \nand distance errors resulting from his damaged visual reaching network, by habitually \nopening his hand widely: the wider the hand aperture, the higher the probability of \nsuccessfully acquiring the object.   \nOf course the present data cannot be generalized to other patients with optic ataxia.  \nIndeed far from supposing that all optic ataxia patients will show a pattern similar to \nM.H.\u201fs, we predict that the results of such testing with other patients will depend \ncrucially on the extent and location of the lesion that causes the optic ataxia.  \nSpecifically, we would expect a primary deficit in grasping, as well as in reaching, \nwhen the optic ataxia is associated with lesions that include area aIPS, which is \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nCavina-Pratesi, C et al. \n \n 22 \nknown from lesion (Binkofski et al., 1998) and TMS studies (Tunik et al., 2005; \nDavare et al., 2007) to play a critical causal role in hand pre-shaping, but not in \nreaching (Rice et al., 2006). M.H.\u201fs structural MRI is consistent with a spared aIPS. \nFigure 6 shows that although brain atrophy is clearly present in parts of the left \nhemisphere, it is more conspicuous within the posterior than the anterior portion of \nthe IPS. Figure 6 shows axial and parasagittal slices taken from M.H.\u201fs brain (which \nwas aligned to the anterior\/posterior commissure and transformed into Talairach \nspace). We superimposed on these slices the activated locations found in previous \nfMRI investigations of grasping (in green: see Castiello & Begliomini, 2008) and \nreaching (in red: see Culham et al., 2008), using the Talairach coordinates of the left \nhemisphere only. It is quite clear that while activations for reaching overlap with \nM.H.\u201fs lesion in the posterior IPS, activations for grasping lie within the more spared \nanterior IPS. Although anoxic lesions are difficult to outline given the presence of \natrophy (Gale et al., 1999; Hopkins et al., 2006), it seems quite clear that M.H.\u201fs grey \nand white matter in the left hemisphere is much more compromised within the more \nposterior reach-related than the more anterior grasp-related areas in the parietal lobe \n(figure 6b). Importantly, M.H.\u201fs lesion within the medial and posterior portion of the \nparietal cortex corresponds remarkably well with the location of the left-hemisphere \nlesion overlap computed from a large sample of optic ataxia patients (yellow crosses: \nKarnath & Perenin, 2005). Of course, only functional MRI (in which we are planning \nto involve M.H. in the near future) can establish with certainty the functional integrity \nof these regions by demonstrating that (i) grasping tasks will activate the spared grey \nmatter within the aIPS, and (ii) reaching tasks will fail to fully activate the medial \nposterior parietal lobe.  \n[Insert figure 6 about here] \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nImpaired grasping in a patient with optic ataxia \n 23 \nOur results thus suggest that when optic ataxia is caused by a lesion mostly \naffecting the dorsomedial posterior portion of the parietal lobe alone, any associated \nimpairments of hand pre-shaping will be a secondary consequence of making \ninaccurate reaching movements. In other words such patients can be regarded as \nhaving a rather pure visuomotor impairment of reaching alone, probably including \nseveral aspects of visual control during arm transport, such as obstacle avoidance \n(Schindler et al., 2004; Rice et al., 2008) and the use of online feedback (Gr\u00e9a et al., \n2002). Our experimental paradigm should enable unambiguous testing for primary \ngrasp and transport deficits to be done with other optic ataxia patients in the future, \nthereby allowing a fuller and more precise description of their visuomotor profile.  \nOur arguments would be of direct relevance to the discovery by Perenin and \nVighetto (1983, 1988) that misreaching was closely linked to impaired visuomotor \ncontrol of hand orientation in their group of unilateral optic ataxia patients. A failure \nto orient the wrist correctly cannot conceivably be accounted for as a secondary \nconsequence of misreaching, given that changes in hand orientation could never serve \nto compensate for poor reaching accuracy. Neurons selectively responsive to \ngrasping, reaching and wrist orientation (Galletti et al., 2003, Fattori et al., 2009) have \nbeen found within visual area V6A within the parietal occipital cortex of macaque \nmonkey, therefore it will be an interesting question for future research to determine \nwhether the visual control of hand orientation can or cannot be dissociated from the \nvisual control of reaching \u2013 or indeed from the control of grasping.  \n \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nCavina-Pratesi, C et al. \n \n 24 \n References \nAstafiev, S.

Subjects sat facing \nthe experimental board and were asked to reach out and grasp a rectangular object \npresented on the left (left panels) or right side (right panels) using their right (first and \nthird rows) or their left (second and fourth rows) hand. Possible object locations are \nshown as black rectangles. For half of the experimental blocks, subjects were required \nto maintain central fixation (white star). The starting hand position was indicated by a \nsmall disc (white dot) which could be attached to the board at one of two positions, \neither near to the body or distant from the body. Outward movements were made from \nthe starting position closer to the body (upper two panels), and inward ones from the \nstarting position further away from it (lower two panels). The Minibird magnet (m) \nwas located on the same side as the stimuli, in line with the fixation point.  \n \nFigure 2: Landing positions of the hand.  The graphs depict the landing positions of \nthe wrist marker at the end of the ballistic part of M.H.\u201fs movements. \u201cHorizontal \nplane\u201d represents left-right space (left negative and right positive) while \u201cDepth \nplane\u201d represents distance from the body (negative near to the body and positive \ndistant from the body). Coloured shapes depict M.H.\u201fs landing positions (yellow \ncircles: left hand, central fixation; red diamonds: right hand, central fixation; green \ntriangles: right hand, free viewing). Grey squares depict the landing positions for the \nright hand of an age-matched control (I.D.) using central fixation. Data are plotted \nseparately for outward (left panel) and inward (right panel) movements. For outward \nreaches the close and the far conditions are depicted by negative and positive depth \nvalues, respectively. Conversely, for inward reaches the close and far conditions are \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nImpaired grasping in a patient with optic ataxia \n 31 \ndepicted by positive and negative depth values, respectively. Black circles represent \nthe calibrated mean landing position and the dotted rectangle around it represents the \nspatial variability associated with the fact that many landing positions are compatible \nwith grasping objects. This spatial variability was computed graphically by using the \nlargest value in length (8 cm) and depth (5 cm) of the two objects. \n \nFigure 3: Mean Transport Errors. The graph illustrates the mean transport error \n(TE) for patient M.H. (black) and controls (white). 95% confidence error is plotted for \ncontrols only. TE is plotted for actions executed with the right hand during free \nviewing (left panel), with the right hand during central fixation (middle panel) and \nwith the left hand during central fixation (right panel). Data are shown separately for \nobjects in left vs right hemispace, for inward vs outward reaches and for close vs far \nmovements.  M.H.\u201fs largest errors are seen when he reaches within right hemispace \nwhile fixating centrally, using his right hand to access objects presented far from the \nhand. Significant differences between M.H. and controls are indicated with an \nasterisk.  \n \nFigure 4: Variability of Transport Errors. The graph illustrates the variance of the \ntransport error for patient M.H. (black) and controls (white). 95% confidence intervals \nare plotted for controls only. Variance scores are plotted for actions executed with the \nright hand during free viewing (left panel), with the right hand during central fixation \n(middle panel), and with the left hand during fixation (right panel). Data are shown \nseparately for objects in left vs right space, for inward vs outward reaches and for \nobjects close vs far from the hand.

The graph illustrates the mean MGA for M.H. \n(black) and controls (white). 95% confidence intervals are shown for controls only. \nData are reported for the right hand during free viewing (left), the right hand during \ncentral fixation (middle) and with the left hand during fixation (right). The MGA data \nare plotted as a function of object size (large vs small), hemispace (left vs right), \nmovement direction (outward vs inward) and distance (close vs far object). M.H. \nshowed no effect of object size on MGA when using his right hand to grasp objects \npresented far from the hand within right hemispace. The only significant difference in \nhandgrip scaling between M.H. and the controls (measured as the regression slope \nacross the two object sizes) is marked with an asterisk.   \n \nFigure 6: Relationship between M.H.\u2019s lesion and fMRI activations during \nreaching and grasping tasks. M.H.\u201fs lesion is shown on axial and parasagittal high-\nresolution anatomical slices aligned to the anterior\/posterior commissures and \ntransformed into Talairach space. The left hemisphere shows some atrophy \nthroughout, however this appears to be more pronounced in the posterior parts of the \nparietal cortex. fMRI activations for grasping (green) and reaching (red) are \nsuperimposed onto M.H.\u201fs brain using the Talairach coordinates taken from Castiello \nand Begliomini, 2008 (Figure 3c) and from Culham et al. 2008 (Table 1 - reaching \nsection), respectively. From each set of Talairach coordinates we extracted the lowest \nand highest X, Y and Z values in order to construct a rectangular area encompassing \nall the listed activations. For the grasping and reaching activations shown in the axial \nslices, the Z values are indicated by the number of slices shown, and the X and Y \nvalues are included within the green\/red areas, respectively. Similarly, for the \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nImpaired grasping in a patient with optic ataxia \n 33 \nreaching activations showed in the parasagittal slices, the X values are represented by \nthe slices, and the Y and Z values are included within the red areas. We have limited \nthe reconstruction to the left hemisphere. It is evident that while the \u201creaching\u201d \nactivations overlap completely with the M.H.\u201fs more atrophic areas in the medial \nposterior parietal cortex, those for grasping lie within the apparently spared anterior \nportion of his parietal cortex. A magnified section of slice 36 highlights the anterior \nand the posterior parietal cortex showing the extent of the damage to both white and \ngrey matter. It appears that while the more anterior portion of the parietal cortex \n(around and within the green square representing grasping activations) shows intact \nwhite and grey matter, the more posterior portion (within the red square representing \nreaching activations) appears seriously compromised. The yellow crosses show the \nlocation of left hemisphere lesion overlap computed for a large sample of optic ataxia \npatients (Karnath & Perenin, 2005, Figure 5a).  \n \n \nFigure 1\nClick here to download high resolution image\nFigure 2\nClick here to download high resolution image\nFigure 3\nClick here to download high resolution image\nFigure 4\nClick here to download high resolution image\nFigure 5\nClick here to download high resolution image\nFigure 6\nClick here to download high resolution image\n"}
