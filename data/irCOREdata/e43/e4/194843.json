The source clearly shows the strong, linear correlation\nbetween rms variability amplitude and flux first seen in Galactic X-ray binaries. The high-\nfrequency power spectral density (PSD) of MCG\u20136-30-15 is examined in detail using a Monte\nCarlo fitting procedure and is found to be well represented by a steep power law at high\nfrequencies (with a power-law index \u03b1 \u2248 2.5), breaking to a flatter slope (\u03b1 \u2248 1) below f br \u2248\n0.6\u20132.0 \u00d7 10\u22124 Hz, consistent with the previous results of Uttley, McHardy & Papadakis.

We speculate that the timing properties of\nMCG\u20136-30-15 may be analogous to those of Cyg X-1 in its high\/soft state and discuss a\nsimple phenomenological model, originally developed to explain the timing properties of Cyg\nX-1, which can explain many of the observed properties of MCG\u20136-30-15.\nKey words: galaxies: active \u2013 galaxies: individual: MCG\u20136-30-15 \u2013 galaxies: Seyfert \u2013 X-rays:\ngalaxies.\n1 I N T RO D U C T I O N\nThe X-ray emission from radio-quiet active galactic nuclei (AGN)\nshows persistent variability that is stronger and more rapid than in\nany other waveband. This rapid X-ray variability provided early\nsupport for the black hole\/accretion disc model of AGN (e.g. Rees\n1984) and suggested that the X-ray emission is produced in the inner\nregions of the central engine (see Mushotzky, Done & Pounds 1993\nfor a review). The X-ray fluctuations appear erratic and random,\nwith variability occurring on a range of time-scales (e.g. McHardy\n1989).\nIn the study of time-variable processes one of the most widely\nused statistical tools is the variability power spectrum (e.g.\nPriestley 1981; Bloomfield 2000). The power spectral density (PSD)\ndescribes the amount of variability power (i.e. amplitude2) as a\nfunction of temporal frequency (time-scale\u22121). The long, uninter-\nrupted observations provided by EXOSAT allowed for the measure-\nment of the first accurate X-ray PSDs for Seyfert 1 galaxies. These\n\u0002E-mail: sav@ast.cam.ac.uk\nEXOSAT PSDs were shown to rise at lower frequencies as a power\nlaw: P( f ) \u221d f \u2212\u03b1 , where P( f ) is the power at frequency f and \u03b1 is\nthe PSD slope, found to be \u03b1 \u223c 1.5 over the frequencies \u223c10\u22125 to\n\u223c10\u22123 Hz (Green, McHardy & Lehto 1993; Lawrence & Papadakis\n1993). This type of broad-band variability, rising to lower frequen-\ncies with a power spectral slope \u03b1 \u0002 1, is usually called \u2018red noise\u2019\n(for an introduction to red noise in astronomy and elsewhere see\nPress 1978).\nThe red-noise PSDs of Seyfert 1s are similar to those observed\nin Galactic black hole candidates (GBHCs, see e.g. van der Klis\n1995) on much shorter time-scales, and suggests that the X-ray\nemission mechanisms may be the same in these objects that differ\nin black hole mass by factors of \u0002105 (McHardy 1989). The PSD\nof the best studied GBHC, Cygnus X-1 in its low\/hard state, can be\napproximated by a doubly broken power law with a steep slope at\nhigh frequencies (\u03b1 \u2248 2 above \u223c3 Hz), breaking to a flatter slope\nat intermediate frequencies (\u03b1 \u2248 1 in the range \u22480.2\u20133 Hz) then\nbreaking to a flat (\u2018white\u2019) spectrum at low frequencies (\u03b1 \u2248 0 below\n0.2 Hz). See Nowak et al. (1999a) and Belloni & Hasinger (1990)\nfor more details of Cyg X-1. Other GBHCs such as GX 339\u20134 show\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n1238 S. Vaughan, A. C. Fabian and K. Nandra\nsimilar behaviour (Nowak, Wilms & Dove 2002). The position of\nthe breaks in the PSD represent \u2018characteristic time-scales\u2019 of the\nsystem, but these time-scales have no clear physical interpretation\nat present (e.g. Belloni, Psaltis & van der Klis 2002 and references\ntherein).\nThe featureless EXOSAT PSDs of Seyfert 1s provided no such\ntime-scales. Such breaks must exist, however, or the total power\nwould diverge at low frequencies (for PSD slopes \u03b1 \u0003 1). Indeed,\nin recent years dedicated X-ray monitoring programmes with RXTE\nhave revealed deviations from the power-law PSD in a few Seyfert 1\ngalaxies; at low frequencies the PSD breaks to a flatter slope\n(Edelson & Nandra 1999; Uttley, McHardy & Papadakis 2002;\nMarkowitz et al. 2003). The time-scale of this break frequency is\nconsistent with the idea that the PSD of AGN and GBHCs are essen-\ntially the same, with the characteristic time-scales scaling linearly\nwith the black hole mass. Such a linear scaling of time-scales with\nblack hole mass might be expected if the characteristic time-scales\nare related to, for example, a light-crossing time-scale or an orbital\ntime-scale. This linear scaling also means that a 100-ks light curve\nof a Seyfert galaxy (such as presented here) is comparable to a\u00011 s\nlight curve of Cyg X-1. On these time-scales a bright Seyfert 1\ngalaxy provides many more photons (by more than two orders of\nmagnitude) than the GBHC, i.e. Seyferts have a higher count rate\nper characteristic time-scale. This means that intensive monitoring\nof Seyferts can provide a view of the very high-frequency varia-\ntions in accreting black holes that is difficult to access even in bright\nGBHCs.\nNot only do AGN and GBHCs show similar PSDs, but they\ndisplay other striking similarities in their X-ray timing properties.\nUttley & McHardy (2001) showed that both X-ray binary and AGN\nlight curves show a tight, linear correlation between flux and rms\nvariability amplitude (see also Edelson et al. 2002). The variabil-\nity properties of GBHCs such as Cyg X-1 are a function of photon\nenergy. The PSD shape above the high-frequency break is energy de-\npendent, with the harder-energy bands showing flatter PSD slopes\n(e.g. Nowak et al. 1999a; Lin et al. 2000). In addition the varia-\ntions between different bands are highly coherent (well correlated\nat each Fourier frequency) and show time delays, with variations\nat softer energies leading those at harder energies (Miyamoto &\nKitamoto 1989; Cui et al. 1997; Nowak et al. 1999a). The magnitude\nof the time delay is frequency dependent, with the delay increasing at\nlower frequencies. To date these properties have only been measured\nin one AGN, NGC 7469 (Nandra & Papadakis 2001; Papadakis,\nNandra & Kazanas 2001), and in this object the energy dependence\nof the PSD slope, the coherence and time-delay properties appeared\nremarkably similar to those seen in Cyg X-1. These similarities re-\nenforce the idea that the X-ray emission mechanisms are the same\nin GBHCs and AGN.\nThis paper presents a detailed analysis of the X-ray continuum\nvariability of the bright, variable Seyfert 1 galaxy MCG\u20136-30-15\n(z = 0.007 749) using a long XMM\u2013Newton observation. The large\ncollecting area, wide bandpass and long orbit (\u223c2 d) of XMM\u2013\nNewton make it ideal for examining the high-frequency (\u000210\u22125 Hz)\ntiming properties of Seyfert galaxies. The analysis concentrates on\nfrequency-domain (i.e. Fourier) time series analysis techniques, as\nthese are used extensively in the analysis of GBHC data. The rest\nof this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 the data reduc-\ntion procedures are outlined. In Section 3 the basic properties of the\nlight curves are discussed, followed by an analysis of the PSD in\nSection 4. Spectral variability is then examined in detail by mea-\nsuring the coherence and time lags between different energy bands,\nas discussed in Section 5. As these analyses are relatively new to\nAGN studies we discuss the methodology in some detail. Finally,\nthe implications of these results are discussed in Section 6 and some\nconcluding remarks are given in Section 7.\n2 DATA R E D U C T I O N\nXMM\u2013Newton (Jansen et al. 2001) observed MCG\u20136-30-15 over the\nperiod 2001 July 31\u20132001 August 5 (revolutions 301, 302 and 303),\nduring which all instruments were operating nominally. Fabian et al.\n(2002) discuss details of the observation and basic data reduction.\nFor the present paper the data were reprocessed entirely with the lat-\nest software (SAS v5.3.3), but the procedure followed that discussed\nin the previous paper (except that the extraction region was a circle\nof radius 35 arcsec for both MOS and pn).\nLight curves were extracted from the EPIC pn data in four dif-\nferent energy bands: 0.2\u201310.0 keV (full band), 0.2\u20130.7 keV (soft\nband), 0.7\u20132.0 keV (medium band) and 2.0\u201310.0 keV (hard band).\nThese were corrected for telemetry drop outs (less than 1 per cent\nof the total time), background subtracted and binned to 100-s time\nresolution. The errors on the light curves were calculated by propa-\ngating the Poisson noise. The light curves were not corrected for the\n\u223c71 per cent \u2018live time\u2019 of the pn camera (Stru\u00a8der et al. 2001), which\nis only a scaling factor. The EPIC MOS light curves were also exam-\nined, but these are essentially identical to the pn light curves except\nwith a lower signal-to-noise ratio. Therefore, in the rest of this paper\nthe analysis concentrates on the pn data, but the MOS data are used\nto confirm the pn results of Section 5. The full-band light curves are\nshown in Fig. 1. The revolutions provided three uninterrupted light\ncurves of 80-, 123- and 124-ks duration.\nAs discussed in Fabian et al. (2002), BeppoSAX observed MCG\u2013\n6-30-15 simultaneously with XMM\u2013Newton, but these data are not\nused in the present paper. The LECS and MECS data cover approx-\nimately the same bandpass as the EPIC (but with a lower signal-\nto-noise ratio) and the higher-energy PDS data (with a count rate\nof \u223c0.7 count s\u22121) do not have sufficient statistics to determine the\nhigh-energy variability properties accurately. In addition, analysis\nof the BeppoSAX data is complicated by the poor sampling of the\nlight curves (owing to repeated Earth occultations and SAA pas-\nsages), indeed the amount of \u2018good\u2019 exposure time obtained for the\nPDS was 40 ks spread over a >400 ks observing period.\n3 BA S I C T E M P O R A L P RO P E RT I E S\nThe source shows a factor of 5 variation between minimum and max-\nimum flux (both occurring during revolution 303), and significant\nvariability can be seen on time-scales as short as \u223c100 s.\nAs a first measure of the variability amplitude the rms amplitude,\nin excess of Poisson noise, was calculated as\n\u03c3rms =\n\u221a\nS2 \u2212 \u03c3 2err, (1)\nwhere S2 is the total variance of the light curve x(t i) of length N\ndata points\nS2 = 1\nN \u2212 1\nN\u2211\ni=1\n[x(ti ) \u2212 x\u00af]2, (2)\nwhere x\u00af is the mean of x(t i) and \u03c3 2err is the contribution expected\nfrom measurement errors\n\u03c3 2err =\n1\nN\nN\u2211\ni=1\n[\u03c3err(ti )]2 (3)\nand \u03c3 err(t i) is the error on x(t i).\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS, MNRAS 339, 1237\u20131255\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nVariability of MCG\u20136-30-15 1239\nFigure 1.

The values of \u03c3 rms\nfrom all three orbits were then binned as a function of count rate\nsuch that there were 20 measurements per bin, and an error was\nassigned based on the scatter within each bin (equation 4.14 of\nBevington & Robinson 1992). Fig. 3 shows the resulting correlation\nbetween \u03c3 rms and count rate in the four energy bands. The signifi-\ncance of the correlation was tested using the Spearman rank-order\ncorrelation coefficient, r s, and the Kendall \u03c4 coefficient (Press et al.\n1992). Both of these indicate that the correlation is significant at\n\u000299.5 per cent confidence in all energy bands. The effect of\nthe rms-flux correlation can be seen in the light curves (Fig. 1):\nthe peaks of the light curves appear more variable (\u2018jagged\u2019)\nwhile the troughs appear much smoother.\nTable 2 shows the results of fitting a linear model to these data;\nin all cases the linear model gives a good fit to the data, with a\ny-axis intercept consistent with zero. The gradient of this relation\ncorresponds to the Fvar measured only on these time-scales (between\n100 and 1500 s). The 1\u03c3 upper limit on any constant flux offset\n(x-intercept) is 1.2 count s\u22121 for the full band, or 6.2 per cent of the\ntotal count rate in that band. In the three energy subbands the upper\nlimits on the constant flux offset are as follows: 1.04 count s\u22121\n(12 per cent), 0.09 count s\u22121 (1.3 per cent) and 0.43 count s\u22121\n(12.8 per cent) for the soft, medium and hard bands, respectively.\nTable 2.

For a general introduction\nto Fourier methods of time series analysis see, e.g., Priestley (1981)\nand Bloomfield (2000), and for a review of Fourier techniques as\napplied to X-ray time series analysis see van der Klis (1989).\n4.1.1 Measuring the periodogram\nIf the light curve x(t i) is evenly sampled (with a sampling period\n\tT ) then the PSD can be estimated by calculating the periodogram.1\nThis is the normalized, modulus-squared of the discrete Fourier\ntransform (DFT) of the data. The DFT of the light curve, X ( f j), is\ncalculated as (see Press et al. 1992)\nX ( f j ) =\n(\n\tT\nN\n)1\/2 N\u2211\ni=1\nx(ti )e2\u03c0i f j ti = RX ( f j ) + iIX ( f j ), (4)\nwhere RX( f j) and I X( f j) are the real and imaginary parts of the\nDFT given by the discrete cosine and sine transforms, respectively:\nRX ( f j ) =\n(\n\tT\nN\n)1\/2 N\u2211\ni=1\nx(ti ) cos(2\u03c0 f j ti )\nIX ( f j ) =\n(\n\tT\nN\n)1\/2 N\u2211\ni=1\nx(ti ) sin(2\u03c0 f j ti ). (5)\nThe transforms are normalized by (\tT \/N )1\/2 so that the ampli-\ntudes are independent of the sampling and length of the light curve.\nThe DFT is calculated at N\/2 evenly spaced frequencies f j = j\/N\n\tT (where j = 1, 2, . . . , N\/2). Thus the highest frequency acces-\nsible to the DFT is the Nyquist frequency, f Nyq = f N\/2 = 1\/2\tT ,\nand the lowest frequency is f 1 = 1\/N\tT . Note that it is customary\nto subtract the mean flux from the light curve before calculating the\nDFT, this eliminates the zero-frequency power.\nThe complex valued DFT is then squared\n|X ( f j )|2 = X\u2217( f j )X ( f j ) = [RX ( f j )]2 + [IX ( f j )]2, (6)\nwhere \u2217 denotes the complex conjugate. The periodogram, P( f j),\nis then calculated by choosing an appropriate normalization:\nP( f j ) = 2\nx\u00af2\n|X ( f j )|2. (7)\n[Note that the Fourier transform has already been normalized in\nequations (4) and (5) to account for the data sampling.]\nThis normalization (defined in van der Klis 1997, see also\nMiyamoto et al. 1991) is most commonly used in analysis of AGN\nand X-ray binaries because the integrated periodogram yields the\nfractional variance of the data (i.e. F2var). This normalization will be\nused throughout this paper. The factor of 2 arises because this is a\n\u2018one-sided\u2019 normalization; the periodogram is defined for both neg-\native and positive frequencies, with this normalization the integral\n1 Following Priestley (1981) we use the term \u2018periodogram\u2019 to denote the\ndiscrete function P( f j) described by equation (7), which is merely an es-\ntimator of the continuous PSD P( f ). The periodogram is therefore related\nto each new realization of the process, whereas the PSD is representative of\nthe true, underlying process.\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS, MNRAS 339, 1237\u20131255\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nVariability of MCG\u20136-30-15 1241\nover only positive frequencies yields the fractional variance. The\nintegrated periodogram between two frequencies, say f 1 and f 2,\nyields the contribution to the fractional variance owing to variations\nbetween the corresponding time-scales 1\/ f 2 and 1\/ f 1 (this follows\nfrom Parseval\u2019s theorem, see e.g. van der Klis 1989). The units for\nthe periodogram ordinate are (rms\/mean)2 Hz\u22121 (where rms\/mean\nis the dimensionless quantity Fvar) or simply Hz\u22121.\n4.1.2 Poisson noise\nIf the time series is a continuous photon counting signal binned\ninto intervals of \tT , as it is here, the effect of Poisson noise is\nto add an approximately constant amount of power to the peri-\nodogram at all frequencies. Thus, at high frequencies, where the\nred-noise spectrum of the AGN is weak, the observed periodogram\nwill be dominated by the flat (\u2018white\u2019) Poisson noise spectrum.\nWith the above normalization this constant Poisson noise level is\nPN = 2\/x\u00af . This formally assumes zero background flux, but for the\npresent observation this is a reasonable approximation (even in the\nhard band the background count rate is \u223c0.6 per cent that of the\nsource).\n4.1.3 Scatter in the periodogram\nA periodogram measured from a single light curve shows a great\ndeal of scatter around the underlying PSD. This is a natural out-\ncome of measuring the periodogram from a single realization of\na stochastic process. The result of this is that the periodogram at\na given frequency, P( f ), is scattered around the underlying PSD,\nP( f ), following a \u03c7 2 distribution with two degrees of freedom (dof)\n(see Section 6.2 of Priestley 1981):\nP( f ) = P( f )\u03c722\n\/\n2, (8)\nwhere \u03c722 is a random variable distributed as \u03c7 2 with two degrees\nof freedom, i.e. an exponential distribution with a mean and vari-\nance of two and four, respectively.2 The expectation value of the\nperiodogram at a frequency f is thus equal to the PSD but so is its\nstandard deviation, as a result the periodogram shows a great deal of\nscatter. This fundamental property of the periodogram is discussed\nin terms of X-ray time series analysis by, for example, Leahy et al.\n(1983), van der Klis (1989), Papadakis & Lawrence (1993), Timmer\n& Ko\u00a8nig (1995) and Stella et al. (1997). In addition the periodogram\nis an inconsistent estimator of the PSD because this intrinsic scatter\ndoes not decrease as the number of data points in the light curve\nis increased. The periodogram can, however, be averaged (binned\nover separate light curves or adjacent frequencies) to reduce this\nscatter and produce a consistent estimate of the PSD (Jenkins &\nWatts 1968).\nIn GBHC analysis the light curves are typically broken into many\nseparate segments and periodograms are calculated for each seg-\nment. At a given Fourier frequency the periodogram estimates from\neach light curve are identically and independently distributed (as-\nsuming the variability is stationary) and so their average will become\nGaussian (following the central limit theorem). Therefore, averag-\ning the periodograms from many independent light-curve segments\nwill produce a consistent estimate of the PSD with Gaussian errors\n(e.g. van der Klis 1997). However, dividing up the light curve limits\n2 For the case of even N the Fourier transform at the Nyquist frequency [DFT\n( f Nyq)] is always real, and the periodogram at this frequency [P( f Nyq)] is\ndistributed as \u03c721, i.e. with one degree of freedom.\nthe lowest frequency probed by the periodogram and so is not so\nsuitable for AGN analysis where it is crucial to examine the widest\nfrequency range possible.\nAn alternative technique is discussed by Papadakis & Lawrence\n(1993) and is in some sense \u2018optimal\u2019 for red-noise light curves such\nas those from AGN. In this method a single periodogram is com-\nputed from the light curve, reaching down to the lowest accessible\nfrequencies, and periodogram estimates at consecutive frequencies\nare averaged. For evenly sampled data the periodogram estimates\nat each Fourier frequency are independently distributed (according\nto equation 8) and so the averaged periodogram estimate in each\nfrequency bin will tend to a Gaussian distribution. In the method of\nPapadakis & Lawrence (1993) it is the logarithm of the periodogram\nthat is binned, such that each bin contains N \u0003 20 periodogram es-\ntimates, and an error is assigned based on the scatter within each\nbin. Using the logarithm of the periodogram means the distribution\nof the binned periodogram converges to a Gaussian with fewer data\npoints per bin, and therefore allows for finer frequency binning. This\nbinning method is used throughout this paper to produce binned pe-\nriodogram estimates with errors. (See also van der Klis 1997 for\nmore on binned periodogram estimates.)\n4.1.4 Bias in the periodogram\nA further point is that periodograms measured from finite data tend\nto be biased by windowing effects that further complicate their in-\nterpretation (van der Klis 1989; Papadakis & Lawrence 1993; Uttley\net al. 2002). The observed light curve [ f (t)] is the true, continuous\nlight curve of the source [l(t)] multiplied by the sampling, \u2018window\u2019,\nfunction [w(t)]:\nf (t) = l(t) \u00b7 w(t), (9)\nwhere the window function takes the value unity when the light\ncurve is sampled and zero elsewhere. From the convolution theo-\nrem of Fourier transforms, the Fourier transform of the observed\nlight curve [F( f )] is the Fourier transform of the true light curve\n[L( f )] convolved with the Fourier transform of the window function\n[W ( f )]:\nF( f ) = L( f ) \u2297 W ( f ). (10)\nThe periodogram (which is the square of the DFT of the observed\nlight curve) is therefore the square of the convolution of the DFTs of\nthe true light curve and the window function. Thus the periodogram\ndistorted away from the true PSD by the sampling, i.e. the convolu-\ntion with the spectral window function.\nThis leads to two main effects. The first is because of the discrete\nsampling of the data. If the light curve is not contiguously sampled\nthen power from frequencies above the Nyquist frequency can be\nfolded back, or \u2018aliased\u2019, into the observed frequency range. For\nbinned, continuous light curves such as those presented here, the\naliasing will be negligible (see van der Klis 1989). In any event, from\ncontinuous data the very high-frequency spectrum will be dominated\nby the Poisson noise level and not aliasing.\nThe second effect is \u2018red-noise leak\u2019 and arises as a result of\nthe finite duration of the light curve. Power is transferred from low\nto high frequencies by the lobes of the spectral window function\n(see, e.g., Deeter & Boynton 1982; van der Klis 1997). If there is\nsignificant power at frequencies below the lowest frequency probed\nby the periodogram (i.e. on time-scales longer than the length of\nthe observation), this can manifest itself as slow rising or falling\ntrends across the light curve. These trends will contribute to the\ntotal variance of the light curve (and thus the total power) but, as\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS, MNRAS 339, 1237\u20131255\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n1242 S. Vaughan, A. C. Fabian and K. Nandra\nthe periodogram does not extend to such low frequencies, the power\nwill be transferred into the observed frequency bandpass (i.e. it will\n\u2018leak\u2019 to higher frequencies). Red-noise leak tends to add a constant\ncomponent to the observed periodogram in the form of a power law\nof slope \u03b1 = 2 (i.e. the PSD of a linear trend; see van der Klis\n1997 for more details), the amplitude of this depends on the PSD of\nthe source at low frequencies (see also Section 3.3 of Papadakis &\nLawrence 1995). The effect of red-noise leak on the periodogram\ncan be accounted for using the Monte Carlo simulation procedure\noutlined below.\n4.2 PSD fitting procedure\nThe method employed in the present work is similar to the methods\ndiscussed by Done et al. (1992), Green, McHardy & Done (1999)\nand Uttley et al. (2002). A model PSD is assumed, multiple realiza-\ntions (light curves) are simulated using this PSD and are resampled\nto match the original data (thereby including the distorting effects\nof the sampling). Periodograms are then calculated from the sim-\nulated light curves in the same manner as the real data, averaged\nover the realizations, and this \u2018average distorted model\u2019 (ADM),\nwhich includes the effects of red-noise leak, is compared with the\noriginal periodogram using a goodness-of-fit measure. This method\ntherefore accounts for the biases in the periodogram introduced by\nthe window function. It is important to bear in mind that, as with\nany model-fitting procedure, the results depend on the assumptions\nmade, i.e. the choice of specific models to test.\nThe errors derived from the periodograms (see Section 4.1.3) are\napproximately Gaussian (Papadakis & Lawrence 1993) and there-\nfore the \u03c72 statistic can be used to estimate the goodness of the\nfit. Once a reasonable fit is found, uncertainties on the model pa-\nrameters can be estimated using the \t\u03c7 2 criterion (e.g. Lampton,\nMargon & Bowyer 1976), as in X-ray energy spectrum fitting.\nThe algorithm described by Timmer & Ko\u00a8nig (1995) was used\nto generate the simulated light curves from the model PSD. This\nalgorithm generates a random time series from an arbitrary broad-\nband PSD, correctly accounting for the intrinsic scatter in the powers\n(i.e. equation 8), and is computationally very efficient. The effects of\nred-noise leak can be accounted for by extending the PSD model to\nmuch lower frequencies than required, generating light curves much\nlonger than the observed light curve and using only a segment of the\nrequired length. Data simulated in such a fashion will include power\non time-scales much longer than those probed by each segment\nalone.\nThe fitting procedure is as follows.\n(i) A model PSD is chosen and 500 random light curves are\ngenerated3 using the algorithm of Timmer & Ko\u00a8nig (1995). The\nsimulated light curves were of \u224826 times longer duration than the\norbital light curves in order to account for red-noise leak.\n(ii) From each of the simulated light curves a section from the\nmiddle is resampled to match the data. Specifically, from each (long)\nsimulated light curve three consecutive light curves were extracted,\nto match the three consecutive revolutions, using exactly the same\nsampling as the real data. The logarithmically binned periodogram is\ncomputed in exactly the same way as for the real data (Section 4.3).\n3 The number of simulated light curves was chosen as a compromise between\nthe need for an accurate ADM, which requires a large number of simulations,\nand processing time. With 500 simulations, the mean 1\u03c3 scatter in each ADM\nfrequency bin is 1 per cent.\n(iii) The 500 binned periodograms are then averaged to produce\nthe ADM \u2013 this represents the periodogram after being distorted by\nthe light-curve sampling (folded through the window function).\n(iv) The constant Poisson noise level is added and the comparison\nbetween the ADM and the data is then made by calculating the \u03c72\nof the fit.\n(v) The normalization of the ADM is then adjusted to minimize\nthe \u03c72 (keeping the Poisson noise level fixed).\n(vi) The \u03c7 2 of the fit is then evaluated over a grid of PSD mod-\nels and the minimum, corresponding to the best-fitting model, is\nfound.\nThis method differs slightly from the method of Uttley et al.\n(2002). First, because the XMM\u2013Newton light curves are continuous\nthe effects of aliasing are negligible, thus the simulated light curves\nwere generated with the same time resolution as the data (100 s).\nThe sparsely sampled RXTE data used by Uttley et al. (2002) meant\nthat aliasing was a significant factor and needed to be accounted\nfor in the simulations. The second major difference is that Uttley\net al. (2002) calculated errors on the ADM (based on the scatter in\nthe simulated periodograms), and these were used to estimate the\ngoodness of fit. In the present analysis there are enough data points\nto apply the Papadakis & Lawrence (1993) binning (with N = 20)\nand estimate the error on the observed periodogram directly from\nthe data, for use with \u03c72-fitting.\nThe \u03c7 2-fitting employed in this method relies on the data being\nbinned sufficiently. It would, in principle, be possible to make use\nof the maximum frequency resolution offered by the unbinned pe-\nriodogram by choosing a different goodness-of-fit estimator (e.g.\nderiving the rejection probability directly from the Monte Carlo tri-\nals, as in Uttley et al. 2002). However, the results (the best-fitting\nparameters) are model dependent in any case and so using a different\nmethod is unlikely to yield any further information.\n4.3 The periodogram of MCG\u20136-30-15\nThe periodogram of the full-band data was computed by calculating\nthe periodogram for each revolution of data (following equation 7).\nThe light curves from each revolution, when taken separately, are\nperfectly evenly sampled and uninterrupted. This means that for\neach light curve the periodogram estimates are independent at each\nFourier frequency, and they are also independent between the pe-\nriodograms from the three light curves. The periodograms for the\nthree light curves were therefore combined to produce a single,\nbinned periodogram by sorting the periodogram points by frequency\nand then applying the logarithmic binning (Papadakis & Lawrence\n1993).\nFurthermore, no additional windowing was applied to the data\n(see Section 13.4 of Press et al. 1992 and Section 7.5 of Priestley\n1981). Windowing is often used to suppress the leak of power from\none frequency to another, as it suppresses the side-lobes of the spec-\ntral window function W ( f ) and therefore the amount of power dis-\nplaced to distant frequency bins. However, in exchange for this the\ncentral lobe of the spectral window function is broadened, meaning\nmore power is lost to neighbouring frequency bins. This transfer\nof power between consecutive frequency bins means they are no\nlonger independently distributed, which is required by the binning\nmethod applied above.\nIn order to accurately estimate the Poisson noise level, the peri-\nodograms were first calculated using the full-band light curves with\n10-s resolution. This allows the periodogram to extend up to high\nfrequencies, at which the variability is dominated by Poisson noise.\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS, MNRAS 339, 1237\u20131255\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nVariability of MCG\u20136-30-15 1243\nFigure 4.

Also marked are the predicted noise lev-\nels assuming just Poisson noise in the data. These show that the\npredicted noise level is clearly an accurate estimate of the true noise\nlevel in the data. In the following analysis only the 100-s resolution\nlight curves are used, since above the Nyquist frequency (5 \u00d7 10\u22123\nHz) the periodogram is dominated by the Poisson noise and not the\nsource variability, and the Poisson noise level is assumed to be at\nthe expected value.\nFig. 5 shows the raw periodograms (binned by N =20), calculated\nby combining the periodograms from each revolution.

Trial PSD models used to fit the full-band data.\n4.4 Results\n4.4.1 The full-band PSD of MCG\u20136-30-15\nAs expected, the periodograms shown in Fig. 5 show an approx-\nimately power-law spectrum for the intrinsic (source) variability.\nVarious trial models were fitted to the data (the models are illus-\ntrated in Fig. 6), using the procedure outlined above to constrain the\nPSD. The first trial model was a power law (model 1):\nP( f ) = N f \u2212\u03b1. (11)\nThis model has two free parameters, namely the slope (\u03b1) and nor-\nmalization (N) of the power law (the additional constant Poisson\nnoise level, PN, is kept fixed). As summarized in Table 3, this model\nprovided an unacceptable fit to the data (>99.99 per cent rejection\nprobability). Fig. 7 shows the variation in \u03c7 2 with \u03b1 (for 79 degrees\nof freedom). The \u03c72 of the fit changes little for PSD slopes steeper\nthan 2. This is an effect of the red-noise leak. If the PSD continues\nto very low frequencies as a steep power law (\u03b1 > 2), a significant\namount of power will leak into the observed periodogram in the\nform of an \u03b1 = 2 power law. This red-noise leak contribution will\ncause the observed periodogram to have a slope of \u03b1 \u2248 2 even when\nthe true underlying PSD slope is much steeper. Thus, if the power-\nlaw PSD continues unbroken to low frequencies, it is difficult to\ndistinguish slopes steeper than 2 in the fitting.\nFig. 8 shows the best-fitting power-law model, with a slope of\n\u03b1 = 2.1. This steep slope implies that the PSD must break at low\nTable 3. Results of fitting the full-band periodogram with various trial\nmodels. The models are discussed in the text and shown in Fig. 6. Model\n1 is a simple power law, model 2 is a power law breaking to a slope of\n\u03b1low = 1 at low frequencies, model 3 is a power law with a break to \u03b1low =\n0, model 4 is a power law with a smooth transition to a slope of \u03b1low = 1 at\nlow frequencies and model 5 is an exponentially cut-off power law.

Therefore, PSD\nmodels including a flattening at low frequencies were explored in an\nattempt to constrain the frequency of the break. The residuals from\nthe power-law fit show that the model is too flat above 2 \u00d7 10\u22124 Hz\nand too steep at lower frequencies, suggesting the PSD may break\nin the observed frequency range.\nIndeed, based on long time-scale RXTE monitoring, Uttley et al.\n(2002) found the best-fitting PSD model for MCG\u20136-30-15, in the\n2\u201310 keV band, was a broken power law. When the slope below the\nbreak was fixed at \u03b1low = 1 the slope above the break was found to\nbe \u03b1 = 2.0 \u00b1 0.3, with a break frequency in the range 1.3 \u00d7 10\u22125 to\n1.0 \u00d7 10\u22124 Hz (90 per cent confidence limits).

Fig. 9 shows the fitting residuals using this model\nand the confidence contours for the model parameters are shown\nin Fig. 10.\nAlthough there are only two periodogram points at frequencies\nbelow the break, the detection of the break is nevertheless highly sig-\nnificant. This is because the high-frequency PSD slope is observed\nto be steeper than 2, implying that the effect of red-noise leak is not\nstrong. The steep PSD observed at high frequencies cannot continue\nbelow the lowest observed frequencies; if the PSD remained steep\nto low frequencies the contribution from red-noise leak would cause\nthe periodogram to resemble an \u03b1 = 2 power law over the whole\nobserved frequency range. The steep PSD at high frequencies must\ntherefore break to a flatter slope close to the lowest frequencies\nprobed in order for the high-frequency periodogram to have a steep\nslope.\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS, MNRAS 339, 1237\u20131255\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nVariability of MCG\u20136-30-15 1245\nFigure 11. As Fig. 10 except for model 3.\nThe slope of the PSD below the break, however, is not well con-\nstrained from the XMM\u2013Newton data. Fitting the data with a PSD\nmodel that breaks from a slope of \u03b1low = 0 (model 3) gives a simi-\nlarly acceptable fit but with a slightly lower break frequency (Table 3,\nFig. 11). As these two models both give good fits it is not possible\nto distinguish between them based on these data alone. However, it\nis interesting to note that the break frequency found from the RXTE\ndata is consistent with the break frequency found from the XMM\u2013\nNewton data when the PSD is assumed to break to \u03b1low = 1. The\nbreak frequencies found from fitting the model assuming a break to\n\u03b1low = 0 are inconsistent between RXTE ( f br = 5.1+5.1\u22122.6 \u00d7 10\u22126 Hz)\nand XMM\u2013Newton ( f br = 5+3\u22121 \u00d7 10\u22125 Hz).\nThe exact shape of the break is not well defined from these data.

(14)\nAgain this model has three free parameters, N, \u03b1 and f br, and pro-\nvided a reasonable fit to the data (Table 3, Fig. 13). The best-fitting\nslope for this model is much flatter than for the previous models,\nand the cut-off frequency is much higher than the break frequencies\nin the broken power-law models. That this model provides a good\nfit to the data is perhaps suggesting that the PSD of MCG\u20136-30-15\nsteepens further at high frequencies.\n4.4.2 Energy dependence of the PSD\nOn the basis of the XMM\u2013Newton data alone, PSD models 2\u20135\nall provide reasonable fits to the full-band data.

However, as can been\nseen from Fig. 14, there are no obvious, strong, systematic residuals.\nRefitting these data with model 4 provided very similar fits and refit-\nting using model 5 gave a slightly better fit to the hard-band data but\nslightly worse fits to the soft and medium bands. The possibility re-\nmains that there is some marginally significant structure in the PSDs\nat high frequencies (around \u223c4 \u00d7 10\u22123 Hz in Fig. 14), not accounted\nfor in these simple continuum models, as was also suggested for the\nhigh-frequency PSD of NGC 7469 by Nandra & Papadakis (2001).\nThese points notwithstanding, model 2 was used to parametrize, in\na simple and uniform fashion, the PSD as a function of energy.\nThe break frequencies as determined in each energy band are\nconsistent with one another. However, the slope of the PSD above\nthe break shows significant changes between the energy bands, with\nthe hardest band showing the flattest slope. Table 4 also gives the\ntotal variability powers, in Fvar form, derived from each band (cf.\nTable 1). For each band the total power was estimated by integrating\na binned periodogram (after subtracting off the constant Poisson\nnoise level) to give Fvar,1, and also by integrating the PSD model\n(excluding the Poisson noise component) over the frequency range\n10\u22125 to 5 \u00d7 10\u22123 Hz to give Fvar,2. As was noted in Section 3, the\nmedium band contains the highest total variability power.\n4.4.3 Low-frequency PSD\nThe binned periodograms used above reached down to 3 \u00d7 10\u22125 Hz\nin the lowest-frequency bin. It would, in principle, be possible to\ntreat the three consecutive light curves as a single, longer light curve\n(top panel of Fig. 1) and use this to reach even lower frequencies\nin the power spectrum. However, this three-revolution light curve\nis no longer uninterrupted, owing to the gaps between revolutions.\nThis means that the standard DFT (as discussed in Section 4.1.1)\nis no longer suitable. There do exist periodogram estimators de-\nsigned to deal with data containing gaps, such as the Lomb\u2013Scargle\nperiodogram (Lomb 1976; Scargle 1982) but there are drawbacks\nto using such techniques. First, the gaps in the sampling mean the\nperiodogram estimates at each frequency are no longer independent\nof one another (Scargle 1982), so the binning and error estimation\nused above is not strictly valid. Secondly, the more complicated\nwindow function introduces much greater distortion on the low-\nfrequency periodogram, which would severely limit the amount of\ninformation that could be recovered from the lowest frequencies. For\nthese reasons the results presented in this paper are based entirely\non the more robust, standard DFT method, but for completeness the\nLomb\u2013Scargle periodogram (computed using the algorithm of Press\n& Rybicki 1989) of the full-band light curve is shown in Fig. 16.\nDown to low frequencies this appears to be broadly consistent with\nthe results presented above.\n4.4.4 Stationarity\nThe fundamental assumption underpinning the above analysis is\nthat the variability process is stationary. A stationary process is one\nwhere the statistical properties do not depend on time (see Sec-\ntion 1.3 of Bendat & Piersol 1986 for more on stationarity in ran-\ndom data). Specifically, the assumption made here is that the PSD\nis stationary, i.e. that the light curves are all realizations of the same\nprocess. The rms-flux correlation found in Section 3.2 shows that\nthe variability of MCG\u20136-30-15 is in some sense non-stationary (the\nvariance does change), but in a \u2018well-behaved\u2019 fashion. Indeed, the\nlinear correlation between \u03c3 rms and x\u00af means that the average Fvar\nFigure 16. Unbinned Lomb\u2013Scargle periodogram of the full-band light\ncurve. The large scatter in the periodogram is expected (see Section 4.1.3).\nThe dashed line illustrates the broken power-law model used in Section 4.4 .\nNote that the model has not been fitted to the data and that the Lomb\u2013Scargle\nperiodogram is normalized differently from the periodogram discussed in\nSection 4.1.1.\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS, MNRAS 339, 1237\u20131255\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nVariability of MCG\u20136-30-15 1247\nis constant. In other words, the variations, when normalized by the\nlocal flux, appear stationary.\nThe method outlined in Appendix A of Papadakis & Lawrence\n(1995) was used as a simple check of the validity of this assump-\ntion. If the PSD P( f ) is constant then the (unbinned) periodograms\nobtained from each revolution should be identical except for the scat-\nter dictated by equation (8). Papadakis & Lawrence (1995) define\nthe statistic S from the logarithm of the ratio of two periodograms,\nsummed over a range of frequencies.\nS = 1\u221a\nN\nN\u2211\ni=1\nlog[P1( fi )] \u2212 log[P2( fi )]\u221a\nvar{log[P1( fi )]} + var{log[P2( fi )]} , (15)\nwhere P1( f i) and P2( f i) are the two periodograms, and var {log\n[P1,2( f i)]} = 0.31 (Papadakis & Lawrence 1993).\nIf the underlying PSD is the same in the two periodograms then\nS should be normally distributed with a mean of zero and a variance\nof unity.\nA normalized periodogram was computed for the first 80 ks of\neach of the three revolutions (the light curves were clipped to equal\nduration so that their periodograms had identical Fourier frequen-\ncies) and S was measured for frequencies below 10\u22123 Hz, where the\nsource variability dominates over the Poisson noise. Comparing rev.\n301 and 302 gave S = 1.18, comparing rev. 301 and 303 gave S =\n\u22120.26 and comparing rev. 302 and 303 gave S = \u22121.44. These three\nestimates are all within 2\u03c3 of the expected value assuming station-\narity in the data. Therefore, to first order at least, the assumption of\nstationarity in these data seems a reasonable one.\n5 C RO S S - S P E C T R A L P RO P E RT I E S\n5.1 The cross-spectrum\nThe PSD is often called the autospectrum because it is the Fourier\ntransform of the light curve, multiplied by itself (equation 6). The\ncross-spectrum is a related tool used for comparing the properties of\ntwo simultaneous light curves, such as from different energy bands,\nsay x(t) and y(t). The product of the Fourier transforms of the two\nlight curves gives the cross-spectrum (cf. equation 6):\nC( f ) = X\u2217( f )Y ( f ). (16)\nIn the same way that the PSD (autospectrum) and the ACF are\nFourier pairs, the cross-spectrum and cross-correlation function\n(CCF) are also Fourier pairs. Thus, mathematically speaking, the\ncross-spectrum contains the same information as the CCF.\nThe cross-spectrum is complex valued and can be represented\nin the complex plane by an amplitude and a phase. The complex\nFourier transforms of the two light curves can be written as X ( f )\n= |X ( f )| ei\u03c6x ( f ) and Y ( f ) = |Y ( f )| ei\u03c6y ( f ) and the cross-spectrum\ncan be written as\nC( f ) = |X ( f )||Y ( f )|ei[\u03c6y ( f )\u2212\u03c6x ( f )]. (17)\nThe phase component of the cross-spectrum represents the phase\ndifference between the two light curves (which corresponds to a time\ndelay at that frequency) and is discussed more fully in Section 5.3.\nThe squared magnitude of the cross-spectrum is used to define the\n\u2018coherence\u2019 of the two light curves.\n5.2 Coherence\n5.2.1 The meaning of coherence\nThe coherence, \u03b3 2( f ), is a real-valued function and is essentially\nthe squared cross-spectrum normalized by the autospectra (PSDs)\nof the two light curves.\n\u03b3 2( f ) = |\u3008C( f )\u3009|\n2\n\u3008|X ( f )|2\u3009\u3008|Y ( f )|2\u3009 . (18)\nHere the angled brackets represent an averaging over an ensemble\nof realizations of the processes. Coherence differs from the peri-\nodogram and time lags in the sense that it is only meaningful to talk\nof the coherence from an ensemble of independent measurements\n(either from separate light-curve segments or consecutive frequen-\ncies). Equation (18) defines the linear correlation coefficient of X ( f )\nand Y ( f ) (see Section 9.1 of Priestley 1981).4 The coherence can\nthus be thought of as a measure of the degree of linear correlation\nbetween the two light curves as a function of Fourier frequency, and\nis related to the amplitude of the CCF.\nIn order to illustrate coherence, consider two light curves that are\nrelated by a transfer function \u03c8(\u03c4 ), e.g.\ny(t) =\n\u222b +\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\u03c8(t \u2212 \u03c4 )x(\u03c4 ) d\u03c4 = \u03c8(t) \u2297 x(t). (19)\nThen from the convolution theorem\nY ( f ) = \u0011( f )X ( f ), (20)\nwhere \u0011( f ) is the Fourier transform of \u03c8(t). Therefore\n|Y ( f )|2 = Y \u2217( f )Y ( f ) = |\u0011( f )|2|X ( f )|2, (21)\nand\nC( f ) = X\u2217( f )Y ( f ) = X\u2217( f )\u0011( f )X ( f ) = \u0011( f )|X ( f )|2. (22)\nThe squared magnitude of the cross-spectrum then becomes\n|C( f )|2 = |X ( f )|4|\u0011( f )|2. (23)\nAnd so\n|C( f )|2\n|X ( f )|2|Y ( f )|2 =\n|X ( f )|4|\u0011( f )|2\n|X ( f )|2|\u0011( f )|2|X ( f )|2 = 1. (24)\nTherefore, the coherence is \u03b3 2( f ) = 1.\nThis means that if the two light curves are related by a single,\nlinear transfer function (e.g. a delay or a smoothing) then they will\nhave unity coherence. In other words, if knowledge of one light\ncurve can, in principle, be used to predict the other, the two are\nsaid to be perfectly coherent. If, on the other hand, the light curves\ncontain contributions from completely independent processes then\nthe coherence will be less than unity.\nAnother way of thinking about coherence is in terms of equa-\ntion (17). If the light curves are related by some simple transform\nthen, at a frequency f , there will be a fixed delay between the light\ncurves, i.e. the lag will be the same in each realization of the process.\nIf the phase difference is constant then the value of the numerator\nof equation (18) (the squared mean of equation 17) is equal to the\ndenominator and hence the coherence is unity. The interpretation of\ncoherence is illustrated more fully in Vaughan & Nowak (1997) and\nNowak et al. (1999a).\n4 The function \u03b3 2( f ) defined by equation (18) is often referred to as the\nsquared coherence (Priestley 1981; Bendat & Piersol 1986) and it gives the\nsquare of the linear correlation coefficient.

If the two discretely sampled light\ncurves, x(t i) and y(t i), have DFTs X ( f j) and Y ( f j) then the cross-\nperiodogram is given by the discrete form of equation (16), namely\nC( f j ) = X\u2217( f j )Y ( f j ) = RC( f j ) + iIC( f j ), (25)\nwhere RC( f j) and I C( f j) are the real and imaginary components of\nthe complex cross-spectrum:\nRC( f j ) = RX ( f j )RY ( f j ) + IX ( f j )IY ( f j )\nIC( f j ) = RX ( f j )IY ( f j ) \u2212 IX ( f j )RY ( f j ), (26)\nand RX( f j) and I X( f j) are the real and imaginary components of\nthe DFT of the light curve x(t i) as defined by equation (5). The\ncoherence is estimated using the discrete form of equation (18):\n\u03b3 2( f j ) = \u3008RC( f j )\u3009\n2 + \u3008IC( f j )\u30092\n\u3008|X ( f j )|2\u3009\u3008|Y ( f j )|2\u3009 . (27)\nThe angled brackets here represent an averaging over light-curve\nsegments and\/or consecutive frequencies. In practice, however, the\ncoherence will be compromised by photon noise, which is inde-\npendent between the two light curves and so will lead to an ap-\nparently reduced coherence. As the Poisson noise power is known,\nthis effect can be removed using the recipe outlined in Vaughan\n& Nowak (1997). In the following analysis the noise-corrected co-\nherence and its uncertainty were estimated using equation (8) of\nVaughan & Nowak (1997). The coherence was calculated only for\nfrequencies below 10\u22123 Hz, above this frequency the Poisson noise\npower becomes comparable to the intrinsic source variability and\nequation (8) of Vaughan & Nowak (1997) becomes increasingly\ninaccurate.\nAs mentioned above, the coherence needs to be averaged in some\nfashion. For the present analysis the cross- and autospectra were\ncalculated separately for each revolution. The data from the three\nrevolutions were then combined by sorting in order of frequency\nand then averaged in bins of N = 40 frequency points.\n5.2.3 Coherence properties of MCG\u20136-30-15\nThe coherence function was calculated for the three possible com-\nbinations of the three energy bands (soft\/medium, soft\/hard and\nmedium\/hard). This was repeated using data from MOS1 and MOS2\nas well as the pn and the results were consistent between the detec-\ntors. (The coherence was also estimated individually for each revo-\nlution of data and the results were consistent between the three revo-\nlutions.) The resulting coherence functions are shown in Fig. 17. At\nlow frequencies the coherence is close to unity for all energy bands.\nAt higher frequencies the coherence becomes much lower, partic-\nularly between the soft and hard bands. For comparison, Fig. 17\nshows the function \u03b3 2( f ) = exp(\u2212 f \/8 \u00d7 10\u22124 Hz) compared with\nthe coherence between soft and hard bands.\nThis apparent loss of coherence at high frequencies could be an\neffect of Poisson noise in the data, since at high frequencies the\nintrinsic source power is weaker compared with the noise power. In\norder to test this possibility the coherence was evaluated by compar-\ning light curves in identical energy ranges from the three different\ndetectors. The light curves extracted from the three detectors should\nbe identical, in a given energy band, except for Poisson noise. There-\nfore, the coherence should be unity and any deviation from unity\nwill be a result of Poisson noise. As can been seen from Fig. 18,\nthe coherence is close to unity until the highest frequencies, and the\nFigure 17. Coherence functions between light curves in the three energy\nbands. The different symbols mark the results derived using light curves\nfrom the three EPIC detectors (squares mark pn, circles mark MOS1 and stars\nmark MOS2 data). The dotted line shows the function \u03b3 2( f ) = exp(\u2212 f \/8 \u00d7\n10\u22124 Hz) discussed in the text. This figure can be seen in colour in the online\nversion of the journal on Synergy.\nFigure 18. Coherence functions between light curves from different de-\ntectors in the same energy bands (squares mark pn versus MOS1, circles\nmark pn versus MOS2 and stars mark MOS1 versus MOS2). As these were\ncalculated between light curves from different detectors but identical energy\nranges the intrinsic coherence is unity and deviations from unity are a result\nof Poisson noise. The dotted line shows the function plotted in Fig. 17 rep-\nresenting the loss of coherence observed between the energy bands. Clearly,\nthis function shows a much more pronounced loss of coherence than that\nresulting from Poisson noise. This figure can be seen in colour in the online\nversion of the journal on Synergy.\ndeviation from unity coherence at high frequencies is much smaller\nthan the observed loss of coherence between the different energy\nbands. This, and the fact that the loss of coherence is repeated in all\nthree detectors suggests that Poisson noise is not seriously biasing\nthese results, and that the error bars are reasonable estimates of the\ntrue uncertainties.\n5.2.4 Simulations\nSimulated data were used as an additional test of the accuracy of\nthe coherence estimation. Two simulated light curves were con-\nstructed, representing light curves in two different bands, and the\ncoherence was calculated for them exactly as for the real data. These\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS, MNRAS 339, 1237\u20131255\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nVariability of MCG\u20136-30-15 1249\nsimulations were used as a further test of the effect of Poisson noise\nand to measure the effect of different PSD slopes on the coherence\nfunction.\nThe effect of Poisson noise was tested by simulating coherent\ndata in two bands using the same PSD. The PSD model used was\ntaken from the fit to the soft-band data using model 2 (Table 4). Two\nlong light curves were generated using this PSD and an identical\nrandom number sequence. The two light curves, having identical\nPSDs as well as Fourier phases and amplitudes, were thus identical\nand therefore have unity coherence at all frequencies.\nThe simulated light curves for the two bands were resampled to\nmatch the window function of the real data, i.e. three consecutive\nlight curves were extracted from each to band match the three rev-\nolutions of data. The light curves for the first band were rescaled\nto match the average count rate of the soft-band light curve and the\nlight curves from the second band were rescaled to match the count\nrate of the hard-band data. (The simulated light curves were pro-\nduced using the absolute PSD normalizations found from fitting the\ndata. Thus the absolute variability amplitude of the rescaled sim-\nulated data is as expected based on the real data.) Poisson noise\nwas then added independently to the simulated light curves (i.e. the\nnumber of counts in each time bin was randomized according to the\nPoisson distribution). These two sets of simulated data represent\nsoft- and hard-band light curves in terms of their Poisson noise, but\nintrinsically are perfectly coherent and have the same PSD.\n100 sets of simulated data were produced and for each set\nthe coherence and its error were calculated as discussed in\nSection 5.2.2 (i.e. using the recipe of Vaughan & Nowak 1997). The\naverage and standard deviation of the coherence estimates from the\n100 sets of simulated data are shown in the top panel of Fig. 19. Also\nshown are the average error bars. The coherence is clearly very close\nto unity over the frequency range examined, and the standard de-\nviation of the estimates is close to the mean error bar, indicating\nthat the Vaughan & Nowak (1997) method did accurately recover\nthe intrinsic coherence from the effect of the Poisson noise. (Note\nthat these error bars are slightly smaller than those derived from the\nFigure 19. Average coherence function measured from (perfectly coherent)\nsimulated data. The top panel shows results using light curves with identical\nPSDs, the bottom panel shows results when different PSDs are assumed for\nthe two light curves. The error bars on the data points represent the standard\ndeviation of the coherence estimates, and the lines without data points rep-\nresent the average of the estimated error bars. Clearly, the coherence is close\nto unity and the error estimates are close to the expected scatter.\nreal data because the uncertainty is itself a function of the intrinsic\ncoherence, which is lower in the real data.)\nThe tests above used intrinsically coherent data with identical\nPSD shapes. The PSD fits of Section 4.4.2 show that the PSD shape\nis energy dependent. In order to confirm that the coherence is not\nbiased because of the PSD shape being different in different energy\nbands, the experiment was repeated using PSDs appropriate for the\ntwo bands. Specifically, the best-fitting PSD models for the soft\nand hard bands (listed in Table 4) were used to generate simulated\nsoft- and hard-band light curves, but again the two sets of data used\nan identical random number sequence. Thus the simulated soft-\nand hard-band light curves again have unity intrinsic coherence but\ndifferent PSDs. As before, 100 sets of simulated data were used\nand the average coherence and error were calculated. The results\nare shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 19. The average coherence is\nagain very close to unity, indicating the different PSD slopes in the\ndifferent bands did not bias the results.\nThe loss of coherence observed in MCG\u20136-30-15 is thus not an\nartefact of Poisson noise in the data, nor the change in PSD slope\nwith energy, and is repeated in each of the three EPIC cameras.\nAs such, in the discussion below, it is assumed that this loss of\ncoherence is intrinsic to the continuum variations of the source.\n5.3 Time lags\n5.3.1 Estimating the time lags\nAs mentioned in Section 5.1, the cross-spectrum also contains in-\nformation concerning the phase differences between the two light\ncurves (equation 17). This information is similar to the delays mea-\nsured by the CCF, except measures the delay as a function of Fourier\nfrequency. The phase lag is measured from the phase of the averaged\ncross-periodogram:\n\u03c6( f j ) = arg\n[\u3008C( f j )\u3009] = tan\u22121\n[ \u3008IC( f j )\u3009\n\u3008RC( f j )\u3009\n]\n, (28)\nwhere C( f j) is calculated using equation (25) and the angled brack-\nets denote an averaging over consecutive frequency points and\/or\nlight curves. This phase difference can then be converted into a time\ndelay at Fourier frequency f :\n\u03c4 ( f j ) = \u03c6( f j )\/2\u03c0 f j . (29)\nOnly if the coherence is high at a given frequency is the time lag\nmeaningful. If the two light curves are not coherent then the individ-\nual phase estimates from the two light curves are poorly correlated\nand so the phase difference of the average cross-spectrum has no\nuseful interpretation.\nFor the present analysis, the time lag was calculated using equa-\ntions (28) and (29), with the averaging of the cross-spectrum per-\nformed in bins of N = 40 frequency points. The error on the time lag\nestimate was computed using equation (16) of Nowak et al. (1999a).\nSee Section 9.1.3 of Bendat & Piersol (1986) for a derivation of this\nequation.\n5.3.2 Poisson noise effects\nThe effect of Poisson noise is to add an independent, random com-\nponent to the phases of the two light curves and hence randomize\nthe phase difference. This means that small time lags are difficult to\ndetect owing to photon noise. The recipe outlined in Nowak et al.\n(1999a) (see their Section 4.2) was used to estimate the effective\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS, MNRAS 339, 1237\u20131255\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n1250 S.

Estimate of the sensitivity level of time lag measurements.\nThe dotted line shows the uncertainty in the time lag owing to Poisson\nnoise and the solid line represents the approximate time lags measured, as\ndescribed by the function given in Section 5.3.3. For frequencies above \u22486 \u00d7\n10\u22124 Hz the time lags will not be recoverable from the Poisson noise.\nnoise limit, below which it is difficult to detect reliable lags. The es-\ntimated error on the phase lag is computed using their equation (14):\n\t\u03c6( f ) \u2248\n\u221a\nPN\nN\u03b3 2( f )\n1\u221aP( f ) . (30)\nThis uncertainty was calculated using values appropriate for the\nhard band (PSD normalization, slope and noise level PN from Sec-\ntion 4.4, and coherence estimated using the function given in Sec-\ntion 5.2.3). This estimated uncertainty, which should be considered\nmerely a lower limit on uncertainty introduced by Poisson noise,\nwas compared with the function used in Section 5.3.3 to illustrate\nthe observed time lags and the results are shown in Fig. 20. This\nindicates that above \u223c6 \u00d7 10\u22124 Hz the lags are too small to be de-\ntected, i.e. they fall below the sensitivity limit defined by the Poisson\nnoise. A further point is that the coherence is significantly below\nunity at higher frequencies (\u0002few 10\u22124 Hz), in which case any mea-\nsured time lag is no longer meaningful. Therefore, from these data,\nsignificant time lags will only be detectable below a few \u00d7 10\u22124 Hz.\n5.3.3 Time lags in MCG\u20136-30-15\nThe time lags were computed (for each EPIC detector) for the three\ncombinations of energy bands. The results are shown in Fig. 21. In\neach test (three combinations of energy bands and three different\ndetectors) there was a significant lag at the lowest frequencies, with\nthe softer band leading the harder band. At higher frequencies the\nlag becomes consistent with zero. The lag is small, only \u223c1 per cent\nbetween soft and hard bands (e.g. on a time-scale of 20 000 s the\nlag is only \u223c200 s). This is illustrated in Fig. 21, which shows the\nfunction \u03c4 ( f ) = 0.013 f \u22121 compared with the measured time lags\nbetween the soft and hard bands.\nThe time lags were calculated using light curves for the three\ndifferent detectors in identical energy ranges, to test the possible\ninfluence of Poisson noise (see Section 5.2.3). These are shown in\nFig. 22. In these tests the lag was consistent with zero over most\nof the useful frequency range. This, combined with the analysis of\nSection 5.3.2 and the fact that the lags were recovered independently\nfrom each EPIC camera, suggests that the lags observed between\ndifferent energy bands are not an artefact of Poisson noise (which\nin any event would destroy any time lag signal).\nFigure 21. Time lags between light curves in the three energy bands. The\nsymbols are as in Fig. 17. A positive lag indicates that the first band leads the\nsecond one. The dotted line shows the function \u03c4 ( f ) = 0.013 f \u22121 discussed\nin the text. This figure can be seen in colour in the online version of the\njournal on Synergy.\nFigure 22. Time lags between light curves from different detectors in the\nsame energy bands. Squares mark pn versus MOS1, circles mark pn versus\nMOS2 and stars mark MOS1 versus MOS2. As the light curves being com-\npared cover identical energy ranges they should differ only as a result of\nPoisson noise and thus result in zero lag, any lags observed will be a result\nof Poisson noise. The dotted line shows the function plotted in Fig. 21. As\ncan be seen, the observed lags between bands (Fig. 21) are much larger than\nthose resulting from Poisson noise. This figure can be seen in colour in the\nonline version of the journal on Synergy.\n5.3.4 Simulations\nThe simulated data used in Section 5.2.4 to assess the accuracy of\nthe coherence function were also used to assess the accuracy of the\ntime-delay spectrum.\nIn the first set of simulations the data in the two bands were gen-\nerated using the same PSD and the same random number sequence.\nIn addition to having unity coherence, the pairs of simulated data\nalso have identical Fourier phases and therefore zero intrinsic phase\nlag between them. The top panel of Fig. 23 shows the average of the\ntime-delay estimates, their standard deviation and the average error\nestimate from the 100 pairs of simulated data (including Poisson\nnoise as described in Section 5.2.4). This average spectrum is close\nto the zero-delay expectation meaning that the Poisson noise did not\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS, MNRAS 339, 1237\u20131255\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nVariability of MCG\u20136-30-15 1251\nFigure 23.

The bottom panel\nof Fig. 23 shows the average time-delay spectrum, which again is\nas expected if the delay estimate is unbiased.

A strong, linear correlation is found between the rms\nvariability amplitude and the source flux (Section 3.2). The PSD was\nexamined by fitting model power spectra to the data after allowing\nfor the distorting effects of sampling using a Monte Carlo procedure\n(Section 4). However, the excellent sampling of the XMM\u2013Newton\nlight curves means that these biases are in any case minimized and\nso there was a minimum of information lost from the PSD. The\nPSD is well represented by a power law of slope \u03b1low = 1 at low\nfrequencies, breaking to a slope of \u03b1 \u2248 2.5 at a frequency of f br \u2248\n10\u22124 Hz. However, it should be re-iterated that these PSD results are\nmodel dependent, and that parametrizing the PSD using a different\nmodel yields slightly different results.\nThe PSD is energy dependent, with the variations in the higher-\nenergy band showing a flatter PSD slope (above the break frequency)\nthan variations in the softer bands. There is no evidence for any en-\nergy dependence of the break frequency. Fig. 24 illustrates the PSD\nshape and energy dependence. Fitting the PSD as a function of en-\nergy revealed tentative hints of energy-dependent, high-frequency\nstructure in the PSD (Section 4.4.2). This could be caused by subtle\ninstrument effects or may represent low-amplitude structure intrin-\nsic to the source PSD (see also Nandra & Papadakis 2001). These\ntime-scales (\u000210\u22123 Hz) are comparable to the dynamical time-scale\nat the innermost stable orbit around the black hole. However, further\nFigure 24.

This figure can be seen in colour in the online\nversion of the journal on Synergy.\nprogress on the very high-frequency variability of relatively faint\nsources such as Seyfert galaxies must await future high-throughput\nmissions such as Constellation-X and XEUS.\nThe variations observed in different energy subbands are highly\ncoherent at low frequencies (long time-scales) but the coherence\nfalls significantly below unity above a few \u00d7 10\u22124 Hz, close to the\nbreak in the PSD (Section 5.2). The high coherence between soft and\nhard bands at low frequencies means that the two bands are linked\nby a single, linear transfer function. The direction and magnitude\nof the time lag shows that the hard photons lag the soft photons, on\naverage, by \u223c200 s at a frequency f \u2248 6 \u00d7 10\u22125 Hz (Section 5.3).\nIt is not possible to reliably constrain the frequency dependence of\nthe time lags, but the data seem consistent with an approximately\n\u03c4 \u221d f \u22121 dependence of the lag [i.e. a constant phase difference \u03c6( f )]\nsimilar to that seen in the Seyfert galaxy NGC 7469 (Papadakis\net al. 2001) and in GBHCs (Nowak et al. 1999a; Pottschmidt et al.\n2000). On shorter time-scales the coherence falls well below unity,\nimplying that there is no simple transfer function relating soft and\nhard bands.\n6.2 Comparison with previous analyses\nUttley et al. (2002) presented an analysis of long time-scale mon-\nitoring of MCG\u20136-30-15 using RXTE. The PSD was found to be\nbest described by a broken power law with slope of \u03b1low = 1 at low\nfrequencies, breaking to \u03b1 = 2.0 \u00b1 0.3 at a frequency f br = 0.13\u2013\n1.02 \u00d7 10\u22124 Hz. Using the same PSD model, the break frequency\nfound from the high-frequency XMM\u2013Newton data is f br = 0.6 \u2212\n2.0 \u00d7 10\u22124 Hz, consistent with the RXTE result. The slope of the\nPSD above the break is different, but this is most likely an effect\nof the energy dependence of the PSD. Indeed, using the 2\u201310 keV\nXMM\u2013Newton data (i.e. the same energy range used by Uttley et al.\n2002) the slope of the high-frequency PSD is \u03b1 \u2248 2.10 \u00b1 0.15,\nwhich is consistent with the RXTE result.\nThe break frequency presented here (and in Uttley et al. 2002)\nis model dependent. This is because a model PSD had to be as-\nsumed and fitted to the data to derive the appropriate parameters.\nHowever, the broken power-law model (with a break to \u03b1low = 1\nat low frequencies) provides consistent results when applied to the\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS, MNRAS 339, 1237\u20131255\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n1252 S. Vaughan, A. C. Fabian and K. Nandra\nlong time-scale RXTE monitoring and the short time-scale XMM\u2013\nNewton observation. This, and the similarity of the observed PSD\nto those of GBHCs (see Section 6.3) suggests that the chosen model\n(and therefore the derived break frequency) is reasonable.\nNowak & Chiang (2000) used RXTE and ASCA data to mea-\nsure the PSD of MCG\u20136-30-15. They found the PSD to break from\n\u03b1 \u2248 0 to 1 at a frequency \u223c10\u22125 Hz and then break again to \u03b1 \u2248\n2 in the range 10\u22124\u201310\u22123 Hz, The position of the high-frequency\nbreak, and the PSD slopes, are roughly consistent with those found\nfrom the XMM\u2013Newton data. However, as noted by Uttley et al.\n(2002), the method employed by Nowak & Chiang (2000) did not\naccount for the distorting effects of sampling (see Section 4.1.4) and\nunderestimated the errors at low frequencies. Once these effects are\nincluded the low-frequency flattening is no longer significant (Sec-\ntion 6.2 of Uttley et al. 2002). Nowak & Chiang (2000) also place a\nlimit on any time delay between soft (0.5\u20132.0 keV) and hard (8\u201315\nkeV) bands of \u03c4 < 2000 s, consistent with the time lag results pre-\nsented here. Reynolds (2000) previously claimed variations in the\n2\u20134 keV band led those in the 8\u201315 keV band by 50\u2013100 s based on\nan RXTE observation of MCG\u201360-30-15.\nHayashida et al. (1998) also estimated the PSD of MCG\u20136-30-\n15, this time using Ginga data. They found a broken power law to\nbe a good fit to the data. However, these authors also did not ac-\ncount for the biases in the periodogram, which will be significant\nbecause of the patchy sampling of the Ginga light curves. The un-\nusually flat low-frequency slope (\u03b1 = \u22120.5) found by these authors\nis most likely a result of bias in the low-frequency periodogram, and\ntherefore the position of their claimed break frequency should be\nconsidered with some caution.\nThe only other AGN for which detailed cross-spectral analysis\nhas been performed is NGC 7469 (Nandra & Papadakis 2001; Pa-\npadakis et al. 2001). In this object the PSD does not show any\nsignificant breaks, but does show the same energy dependence as\nfound in MCG\u20136-30-15. The present analysis shows that the energy\ndependence of the PSD is caused by the slope of the PSD becoming\nflatter at higher energies, rather than a change in the break frequency.\nIn addition, NGC 7469 shows time lags between energy bands in the\nsame direction (soft leading hard) and with the similar relative mag-\nnitude (\u223c1 per cent) as in MCG\u20136-30-15. Papadakis & Lawrence\n(1995) showed that in NGC 4051 the harder band showed a flatter\nPSD than the softer band. Recently, McHardy et al. (in preparation)\nused XMM\u2013Newton data of NGC 4051 and also found this energy\ndependence of the PDS.\n6.3 Comparison with Cygnus X-1\nSince EXOSAT first showed the medium time-scale PSDs of Seyfert\ngalaxies to have a power-law form, their timing properties have been\ncompared with those of GBHCs. Now, with long time-scale mon-\nitoring available from RXTE (Edelson & Nandra 1999; Nandra &\nPapadakis 2001; Uttley et al. 2002) and short time-scale observations\npossible with XMM\u2013Newton (this paper) it is possible to re-assess\nthis comparison.\nThe best studied GBHC, Cyg X-1, when in its low\/hard state\nshows a PSD with an approximately broken power-law form. The\nPSD breaks from a low-frequency slope of \u03b1 \u2248 0 to 1 and then\nto \u03b1 \u2248 2 at high frequencies. The position of the high-frequency\nbreak is typically f br \u2248 3 Hz (Belloni & Hasinger 1990; Nowak\net al. 1999a). The comparable break in the PSD of MCG\u20136-30-\n15 occurs at f br \u2248 10\u22124 Hz. This suggests that the characteristic\ntime-scales in these two systems differ by a factor of \u223c3 \u00d7 104.\nUnder the assumption that the time-scales scale linearly with the\nmass of the central black hole, and assuming Cyg X-1 to contain a\n10-M\u0006 black hole (Herrero et al. 1995), then suggests the mass of\nthe black hole in MCG\u20136-30-15 is \u223c3 \u00d7 105 M\u0006 (in the range 1.5\u2013\n5.0 \u00d7105 M\u0006 using the 90 per cent limits on the break frequency in\nMCG\u20136-30-15). Assuming a bolometric luminosity of 4 \u00d7 1043 erg\ns\u22121 for MCG\u20136-30-15 (Reynolds et al. 1997; converting to H 0 = 75\nkm s\u22121 Mpc\u22121) then implies that MCG\u20136-30-15 is radiating at the\nEddington luminosity. However, since independent mass estimates\n(such as from reverberation mapping) are not available for MCG\u2013\n6-30-15 it remains possible that this mass estimate is inaccurate if\nthe relevant time-scales do not scale linearly with black hole mass\n(as assumed above).\nIf the frequency of the PSD break is related to the orbital fre-\nquency of matter close to where the peak emissivity of the accretion\ndisc occurs, r peak, then it will depend on r peak\/r in, where r in is the\ninner radius of the disc. For a standard disc, r peak\/r in \u223c 2. This will\nalso introduce a dependence on r in\/r g (where r g = GM\/c2 is the\ngravitational radius of the black hole) and thus the spin parameter of\nthe black hole a\/M . If the black hole in MCG\u20136-30-15 has a higher\nspin parameter than that in Cyg X-1, then the mass deduced from\nthe above scaling could be increased.\nThe other temporal characteristics seen in MCG\u20136-30-15 are re-\nmarkably similar to those observed in Cyg X-1, implying there is\nindeed a strong connection between these two types of source. The\nPSD (above the break frequency) is flatter in harder-energy bands\nin both MCG\u20136-30-15 and Cyg X-1 (Nowak et al. 1999a; Lin et al.\n2000). The strong rms-flux correlation first seen in X-ray binaries\n(Uttley & McHardy 2001) is exhibited by MCG\u20136-30-15 (see Sec-\ntion 3.2). MCG\u20136-30-15 also displays a loss of coherence between\nhard and soft bands at high temporal frequencies (i.e. above the\nbreak in the PSD) very similar to that seen in Cyg X-1 (Nowak et al.\n1999a) and time lags between these bands that appear similar (in\ndirection and relative magnitude) to those observed in Cyg X-1. In\nparticular, the time lags measured in MCG\u20136-30-15 between soft\nand hard bands is \u223c200 s in the lowest-frequency bin, where the\ncoherence is near unity. In Cyg X-1 the shortest time lags observed\nare \u223c2 \u00d7 10\u22123 s (Nowak et al. 1999a; Pottschmidt et al. 2000) at\nfrequencies just below where the coherence falls significantly below\nunity. The ratio of these two time lags is \u223c105, similar to the ratio\nbetween the PSD break time-scales.\nIt should also be noted that it is not yet clear whether Seyfert\ngalaxies more closely resemble the low\/hard or high\/soft states of\nGBHCs (see also the discussion in Uttley et al. 2002). In the high\/soft\nstate the PSD of Cyg X-1 is steep at high frequencies (\u03b1 \u0002 2) and\nflattens to \u03b1 \u2248 1 at f br \u2248 10 Hz, with no further flattening evident at\nlower frequencies (Cui et al. 1997; Churazov, Gilfanov & Revnivtsev\n2001; Reig, Papadakis & Kylafis 2002). This ratio of characteristic\ntime-scales in this case is \u223c105 and the corresponding mass estimate\nfor MCG\u20136-30-15 is \u223c106 M\u0006, implying a luminosity \u223c30 per cent\nof the Eddington limit. This high (but nevertheless sub-Eddington)\naccretion rate might be expected if MCG\u20136-30-15 is indeed in a\nstate similar to the high\/soft state seen in Cyg X-1.\nIt is interesting to note that the best-fitting linear model to the\nrms-flux correlation observed in MCG\u20136-30-15 is consistent with\npassing through the zero-flux origin (Section 3.2). The simplest ex-\nplanation of this is if there is no significant constant component\nto the light curve. A strong constant component (\u223c25 per cent\nof the source flux) is observed from the rms-flux correlation in\nCyg X-1 (Uttley & McHardy 2001), but only when the source is\nin the low\/hard state (Gleissner et al. 2002). This is perhaps also\nindicating that the variability properties of MCG\u20136-30-15 are more\nsimilar to the high\/soft state than the low\/hard state of Cyg X-1.\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS, MNRAS 339, 1237\u20131255\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nVariability of MCG\u20136-30-15 1253\n(The time-delay properties of Cyg X-1 when in its high\/soft state are\nrather similar to those seen in its low\/hard state, see, e.g., Pottschmidt\net al. 2000.)\n6.4 Physical implications\nThe X-ray emission mechanism operating in Seyfert galaxies is usu-\nally thought to be inverse-Compton scattering of soft photons in a\nhot corona (e.g. Sunyaev & Titarchuk 1980; Haardt & Maraschi\n1991). In the simplest models the harder photons are expected to\nlag behind the softer photons owing to the larger number of scatter-\nings required to produce harder photons, and the delay should be of\nthe order of the light-crossing time of the corona. The longest ob-\nserved time delay in MCG\u20136-30-15 between soft and hard bands is\n\u223c200 s. Assuming a black hole mass of 106 M\u0006, this lag corre-\nsponds to a light-crossing distance of \u223c40r g. Thus the direction and\nmagnitude of the observed lag in MCG\u20136-30-15 are consistent with\nan origin in a Comptonizing corona. However, if the lags are fre-\nquency dependent (as expected by analogy with Cyg X-1 and also\nseen in NGC 7469; Papadakis et al. 2001) the lags at lower temporal\nfrequencies would become much longer than expected for a compact\ncorona (see the discussion in Nowak et al. 1999b). Indeed, the sim-\nplest such models predict the time delay between soft and hard pho-\ntons to be independent of Fourier frequency (Miyamoto et al. 1988),\ncontrary to what is observed. In addition, some models of Comp-\nton scattering coronae predict that the high-frequency PSD should\nbe steeper for higher-energy photons, owing to the high-frequency\nfluctuations being washed out by multiple scatterings (Hua &\nTitarchuk 1996; Nowak & Vaughan 1996), again contrary to the\nobservations.\nAlternatively, the time delay between soft and hard bands could\nbe caused by the spectral evolution of individual X-ray events. If the\nspectrum of the event becomes harder as the event unfolds this can\nlead to an average lag between soft and hard bands. Such models\nhave been discussed by Bo\u00a8ttcher & Liang (1998) and Poutanen &\nFabian (1999).\nAnother alternative is that the delay between soft and hard bands\ncould be caused by a propagation effect, i.e. a \u2018trigger\u2019 signal reach-\ning the soft emission region before the hard emission region. In\nthis scenario the magnitude of the lag is related to the propagation\nspeed and the distance between soft and hard emission regions. The\nfollowing section describes a model based on this kind of signal\npropagation.\nAt higher temporal frequencies the coherence falls well below\nunity, meaning that there is no longer a simple transfer function\nbetween the soft and hard-band emission. As a static corona should\nmaintain a transfer function (whatever the physical mechanism),\non time-scales longer than the break in the PSD (\u0002104 s), where\nthe coherence is high, the corona may be effectively static (i.e. it\nmaintains its average properties on these time-scales). On shorter\ntime-scales the corona may be dynamic and so the steep PSD above\nthe break and the loss of coherence may be caused by changes in\nthe corona itself.\nThe time-scale of the break in the PSD from f \u22121 to a steeper\nslope is 104 s, which corresponds to a light-crossing distance of\n\u223c2 \u00d7 104r g. The orbital time-scale at 40r g around a 106-M\u0006 black\nhole is torb \u223c 103 s, while the thermal time-scale for a standard, thin\naccretion disc is t th \u223c 104 s (assuming a viscosity parameter \u03b1 =\n0.1), which is of the same order as the time-scale of the break in\nthe PSD. The viscous time-scale in such a disc is many orders of\nmagnitude larger than these other time-scales (see the discussion of\naccretion disc time-scales in Section 5.8 of Frank, King & Raine\n1985). However, if that part of the accretion flow responsible for\nmodulating the X-ray emission is geometrically thick, the break in\nthe PSD could correspond to a viscous time-scale [which depends\non the ratio of disc height H to radius R as \u223c(H\/R)2].\n6.5 A phenomenological model\nVarious models have been considered to explain the variability of\nGBHCs and Seyfert galaxies. These include: various examples of\n\u2018shot noise\u2019 (e.g. Terrell 1972; Lehto 1989; Merloni & Fabian 2001);\nrotating \u2018hotspots\u2019 on the surface of an accretion disc (Abramowicz\net al. 1991; Abramowicz 1992; Bao & \u00d8stgaard 1995); occulta-\ntion by moving clouds (Abrassart & Czerny 2000); self-organized\ncriticality in an accretion disc (Mineshige, Ouchi & Nishimori\n1994); fluctuations in the accretion rate propagating through the\ndisc (Lyubarskii 1997; Churazov et al. 2001; Kotov, Churazov &\nGilfanov 2001) and magnetohydrodynamic instabilities in the inner\naccretion disc (Hawley & Krolik 2001).\nMost of these models were developed to explain only one aspect of\nthe variations (e.g. its red-noise nature). Now, however, it is possible\nto compare the predictions of these models with the well-determined\ntiming properties of MCG\u20136-30-15. A viable physical model has\nto be able to reproduce not only the correct PSD shape and time-\nscales but also the other temporal characteristics such as the rms-flux\ncorrelation, the energy dependence of the PSD, the time lags and\nthe coherence. It is not clear whether any of the above mechanism\ncan explain all the observations, and indeed some models (e.g. the\nobscuration model of Abrassart & Czerny 2000) seem to offer little\nhope of explaining properties such as the coherence and time lags.\nA simple phenomenological model has been developed by\nLyubarskii (1997), Churazov et al. (2001) and Kotov et al. (2001)\nthat seems to explain (qualitatively, at least) the temporal properties\nof Cyg X-1. As the timing properties of MCG\u20136-30-15 discussed\nabove are very similar to those of Cyg X-1, it is worth discussing\nthis model as a possible explanation for the behaviour of Seyfert\ngalaxies.\nIn its high\/soft state, Cyg X-1 shows an f \u22121 PSD over several\ndecades in frequency (Cui et al. 1997; Churazov et al. 2001; Reig\net al. 2002), down to time-scales far longer than would normally be\nassociated with the X-ray-emitting region itself (which is assumed to\nbe compact). The model put forward by Lyubarskii (1997) to explain\nthis very broad range in time-scale has variations in accretion rate\noccurring over a large range of radii from the central black hole\nand propagating in towards the X-ray-emitting region (assumed to\nextend over only a few tens of gravitational radii).\nIf the viscosity parameter of the accretion flow is varying ran-\ndomly and with the same amplitude at all radii, variations in mass\naccretion rate at much smaller radii will have an f \u22121 PSD. The\naccretion rate at the X-ray-emitting region (assumed to be concen-\ntrated at small radii) is thus being modulated by variations produced\nover a large range in radius. If the X-ray emission emerging from\nthis region is proportional to the local accretion rate then the X-ray\nvariations will also have an f \u22121 PSD extending down to low frequen-\ncies. Each radius produces variations at a characteristic time-scale\ncomparable to the time-scale for inward propagation, hence long-\ntime-scale fluctuations are produced at large radii and shorter-time-\nscale fluctuations are produced closer in. This works because any\nvariations on time-scales shorter than the propagation time-scale\nare damped as they move through the disc (see Lyubarskii 1997;\nChurazov et al. 2001). This naturally explains both the f \u22121 part of\nthe PSD (i.e. below the high-frequency break; Churazov et al. 2001)\nand the rms-flux correlation (Uttley & McHardy 2001).\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS, MNRAS 339, 1237\u20131255\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n1254 S. Vaughan, A. C. Fabian and K. Nandra\nOnce these variations reach the inner regions, where accretion\nenergy is released as X-ray emission, variations on shorter time-\nscales are further suppressed, leading to a steepening of the PSD.\nThus the high-frequency break in the PSD from f \u22121 to a steeper\nslope (as seen in MCG\u20136-30-15) is caused by suppression of fluc-\ntuations within the X-ray-emitting region, and the time-scale of the\nbreak in the PSD corresponds to the characteristic time-scale at the\nouter radius of the X-ray-emitting region (Churazov et al. 2001).\nThe emissivity as a function of radius defines a Green function for\nthe incoming f \u22121 fluctuations. In frequency terms, the radial extent\nof the X-ray-producing region makes it act as a \u2018low-pass filter\u2019 for\nthe incident f \u22121 fluctuations, resulting in a break in the PSD, to a\nsteeper slope, at high frequencies.\nThe specific model described by Churazov et al. (2001) has a\nrelatively stable, optically thick, geometrically thin accretion disc\nsandwiched by an optically thin, geometrically thick corona. The\ndisc produces relatively slowly varying thermal emission (which\nwould emerge presumably in the optical\/ultraviolet for a Seyfert\ngalaxy), while it is the variations within the corona that propagate\ninwards to produce the X-ray variability. The time-scale of the high-\nfrequency break thus corresponds to the accretion time-scale (\u223cthe\nviscous time-scale) of the geometrically thick corona at the outer\nedge of the X-ray-emitting region.\nKotov et al. (2001) extended this model by adding the simple con-\ndition that the spectrum of the X-ray-emitting region is a function\nof radius, with the outer regions producing a softer spectrum than\nthe inner regions. This model can then reproduce the observed time\nlags between soft and hard emission. Accretion rate variations prop-\nagating inwards reach the softer emitting region (larger radii) before\nthe harder emitting region (smaller radii), explaining why the soft\nemission leads the hard. This can explain the energy dependence of\nthe time lags (as delay increases with the separation between energy\nbands) and the frequency dependence (since different radii corre-\nspond to different characteristic frequencies and different energy\nspectra). In addition, this model explains the energy dependence\nof the PSD above the high-frequency break. The harder emission\nis produced from smaller radii, which can be modulated by high-\nfrequency fluctuations, hence the harder emission will have more\nhigh-frequency power than the softer emission (i.e. the hard-band\nPSD will be flatter), as observed (see Fig. 24). Also, as the variations\non short time-scales are occurring within the X-ray-emitting region,\ni.e. are a result of the dynamic corona, the coherence between bands\nwill fall off at high frequencies, as mentioned in Section 6.4 (see\nalso the discussion in Nandra & Papadakis 2001).\nSuch phenomenological models require that variations occurring\nat large radii can be fed into much smaller radii and so influence\nthe PSD. The observed iron line profile of MCG\u20136-30-15 from this\nobservation (Fabian et al. 2002) indicates that the disc extends down\nto less than 2r g, and, from the steep inferred emissivity profile,\nthat much of the X-ray power is generated very close to the black\nhole. This presents a challenge for all such models, given that the\ndynamical time-scale of this innermost region is 10\u2013100 s, whereas\nthe time-scales measured (e.g. the PSD break time-scale) are orders\nof magnitude longer. If the f \u22121 PSD of MCG\u20136-30-15 is similar\nto that in the high\/soft state of Cyg X-1 (Reig et al. 2002) then\nthe variability time-scales will extend to many orders of magnitude\nlonger still. Indeed, the total power in f \u22121 spectra diverges so slowly\nthat the PSD could, in principle, continue as f \u22121 until very low\nfrequencies without the total power becoming large. (For example,\nmodel 2 from Section 4.4 could continue down to the unphysically\nlow frequency \u223c10\u221228 Hz without the integrated power exceeding\nFvar = 1!)\n7 C O N C L U S I O N S\nThis paper presents a detailed time series analysis of the continuum\nvariability of MCG\u20136-30-15. The PSD shows a break from f \u22121 to\nf \u22125\/2 at a frequency f br \u223c 10\u22124 Hz. Comparing the break time-\nscale with the analogous time-scale seen in Cyg X-1, and assuming\nthat these scale linearly with black hole mass, gives a black hole\nmass of \u223c106 M\u0006 for MCG\u20136-30-15 and suggests it is accreting at\na significant fraction of the Eddington limit. The slope of the PSD\nabove the break is energy dependent, with the harder band show-\ning more high-frequency power than the softer band. The variations\nin different energy bands also become incoherent above the break\nin the PSD. This leads us to speculate that on time-scales shorter\nthan the break time-scale, the X-ray-emitting corona is dynamic,\nand that harder photons are produced at smaller radii than softer\nphotons. At the lowest Fourier frequencies the soft and hard bands\nare highly coherent and the soft band is found to lead the hard band\nby \u223c200 s. The direction and magnitude of this lag is consistent\nwith simple Comptonization models. A phenomenological model,\noriginally developed to explain the f \u22121 PSD of GBHCs such as\nCyg X-1, is discussed and found to be able to reproduce (quali-\ntatively) the observed temporal characteristics of MCG\u20136-30-15.\nAlthough this model is rather simple and phenomenological it can\nexplain the observed temporal characteristics of the X-ray contin-\nuum in MCG\u20136-30-15.\nAC K N OW L E D G M E N T S\nBased on observations obtains with XMM\u2013Newton, an ESA science\nmission with instruments and contributions directly funded by ESA\nMember States and the USA (NASA).
