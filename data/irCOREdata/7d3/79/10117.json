Cultural and historical perspectives\non Psychoanalytic Observation\u2019\nThe Association of Child Psychotherapists Programme Planning Committee with\nTaylor & Francis Publishers and The International Journal of Infant Observation and\nits Applications, Saturday 12 May 2007\nJENIFER WAKELYN\n27 Temple Fortune Hill, London NW11 7XL, UK\nThis conference, held at University College, London, provided a valuable opportunity to\ndraw together historical and contemporary perspectives and applications of infant and\nyoung child observation.\nIn her introduction as Chair (and author of Infant Observation at the Heart of Training)\nJanine Sternberg (2005) pointed to some of the historical antecedents of the observational\nmethod, including Darwin\u2019s observations of his own baby in the 1880s. She linked the\ndevelopments that psychoanalytic observation can bring for the student-practitioner to\nHouzel\u2019s description of three levels of receptivity \u0001 perceptual, emotional\/empathic and\nunconscious.\nNick Midgley (Anna Freud Centre, Marlborough Family Centre and Centre of\nPsychoanalytic Studies, University of Essex) added to the historical perspective with a\nlively talk evocatively illustrated with recently discovered photographs and film from the\nAnna Freud archive. As a leading figure in the integration of direct observation of children\nwith the new psychoanalytic knowledge emerging from the consulting room in early\ntwentieth century Vienna, Anna Freud played a crucial role in the emergence of the\npsychoanalytic tradition of observation. She recommended infant observation to medical\nstudents to \u2018witness the birth of the mind out of the body and to see the close interaction of\nthe mind with the needs and functions of the human body\u2019.\nHer major contribution came during the Second World War when she founded the\nHampstead War Nurseries. The three nurseries in Hampstead and Essex looked after\nchildren affected by the war as well as undertaking research into children\u2019s psychological\nCorrespondence: E-mail: jwakelyn@tavi-port.nhs.uk\nISSN 1369-8036 print\/ISSN 1745-8943 online # 2007 Tavistock Clinic Foundation\nDOI: 10.1080\/13698030701698208\nInfant Observation, December 2007; 10(3): 235\u0001237\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \nan\nd \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nLi\nbr\nar\ny]\n A\nt:\n 1\n4:\n09\n 1\n8 \nMa\ny \n20\n10\nneeds to inform post-war child care policy. James Robertson was one of six Conscientious\nObjectors who worked in the Anna Freud nurseries to provide a male presence among the\nmainly female staff, some of whom slept in chicken houses to allow visiting parents to stay\nwith their children. High turnover among the staff, many of whom were refugees,\ndiminished when a training programme of evening lectures and reading was set up.\nThe Anna Freud method was one of direct observation; staff were trained to make\ndetailed observations of the children\u2019s play and behaviour, including their eating,\nsleeping and interactions with adults and other children. A card index was kept of\nsalient observations under specific themes. As a result of these observations, especially of\nthe impact of separations on young children, the organization of the nurseries was\nchanged and \u2018artificial families\u2019 were set up. Striking levels of developmental delay were\nrapidly alleviated; and at the same time other complications ensued as the children\nbecame clingy, possessive, demanding, jealous, and visibly distressed when staff left.\nAnna Freud concluded that \u2018choosing between the two evils of broken, interrupted\nattachments or an existence of emotional barrenness, the latter is the more harmful as it\noffers less prospect for normal character development . . . what helps the child to grow\nup normally is the painful, disturbing process of learning how to deal with such\nemotions\u2019.\nCathy Urwin (Tavistock Centre) gave a presentation entitled \u2018Becoming a mother in an\nethnically and culturally diverse community: Infant observation as a research method used\nin exploring changing aspects of identity\u2019. She described findings from the psychoanalytic\nobservation of six babies and first-time mothers followed from birth to one year, as part of\nthe research project funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, with their\n\u2018Identities and Social Action\u2019 programme.\nThe six observers formed a working group and prepared by reading relevant papers.\nEach seminar began with a recapitulation of the family history to lead into an account of\nthe atmosphere in the session and of the emotional work the baby was requiring of the\nmother, and how this was reflected in the material. The observers were also encouraged to\nrecord their reactions to unfamiliar practices; experiences of shock were noted in many\nsessions.\nThe six mothers are part of a larger group of mothers who were all interviewed before,\nduring and at the end of their baby\u2019s first year using the Free Association Narrative\nInterview (FANI) method developed by Hollway and Jefferson (2000). Infant observation\nwas found to be especially useful in revealing how the emotional and physical demands of\nthe relationship with the baby, its pressures and pleasures, evoke the mother\u2019s infantile\nexperiences, memories and associations. As readers will see in many of the papers collected\nhere, the method also showed how the mother\u2019s changing sense of herself as a parent is\nmobilized in the context of social and cultural expectations. Drawing on observations of\nWhite, Bangladeshi, African and African Caribbean mothers and babies, the presentation\nhighlighted differences in handling separateness and separations and the role of the\nextended family in care and support of mother and baby. A common experience in many\nfamilies included passing the baby around; this seemed an important theme for mothers\nwho have been displaced, echoing their own experience of displacement.\nCathy Urwin also addressed methodological issues, the adaptation of the infant\nobservation model developed by Esther Bick and the contribution of the weekly seminar\nto the research process and in deepening understanding of the processes involved in\ndeveloping identity and the impact of cultural differences.\n236 J.
