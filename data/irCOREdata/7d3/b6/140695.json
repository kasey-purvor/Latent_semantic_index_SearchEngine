Moreover regional variations in yields, prices and government grants mean that \nthe relative revenue and cost of such systems can vary substantially within Europe.  To aid \nour understanding of these variations, the European Commission sponsored a research project \ncalled \u201cSilvoarable Agroforestry For Europe\u201d (SAFE).  This paper describes the process of \ndeveloping a new economic model within that project.  The initial stages included \nestablishing criteria for the model with end-users and reviewing the literature and existing \nmodels.  This indicated that the economic model needed to allow comparison of arable \nfarming, forestry and agroforestry systems at a plot- and a farm-scale.  The form of \ncomparisons included net margins, net present values, infinite net present values, equivalent \nannual values, and labour requirements.  It was decided that the model would operate in a \nspreadsheet format, and the effect of phased planting patterns would be included at a farm-\nscale.  Following initial development, additional user feedback led to a final choice on a \nmodel name, a final method of collating input data, and the inclusion of field-based operations \nsuch as varying the cropped area, replacing dead trees, and pruning.  In addition options in \nterms of improved graphical outputs and the ability to undertake sensitivity analysis were \ndeveloped.  Some of the key lessons learnt include the need to establish clear model criteria \nand the benefits of developing a working prototype at an early stage to gain user-feedback.      \n2 \n \nIntroduction \nIncreased population and increased consumption of natural resources per capita are placing \nincreased demands on finite land resources.  The ecosystem approach, popularised by the \nMillennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005), provides one framework for identifying the \nimportance that different stakeholders place on the goods and services that we get from land \n(Agbenyega et al. 2009).  However decisions regarding land use change are still primarily \ntaken by individual land-owners, and profitability is a key consideration (Graves et al. 2009). \n \nDuring the past 50 years, one of the significant land use changes across the European Union \n(EU) has been the removal of individual trees from agricultural land, and conversely the re-\nestablishment of trees on agricultural land in woodland blocks.  This has been partly a result \nof the increased mechanisation of agriculture and the availability of EU-related grants for \nwoodland planting.  One alternative method for re-establishing trees within an agricultural \nsystem is silvoarable agroforestry (Dupraz and Newman 1997; Burgess et al. 2004).  It is only \nrecently that the establishment of such systems has been supported by grants associated with \nthe EU Rural Development Regulation 1698\/2005 and, the grants are only available in some \nEU countries.  However the decision to establish a silvoarable agroforestry system can be \ncomplex because the financial return from the tree component (in the absence of grants) can \ntake many years, and the effect of the trees on crop yields can vary with time.  Moreover the \nlikely response will vary with tree spacing and tree species and the grants available can vary \nsubstantially between countries.    \n \nOne method for determining the profitability and feasibility of silvoarable systems, relative to \narable and forestry systems, is to use computer-based models (Graves et al. 2005).  Although \nthere is some literature describing the results and analyses obtained from using computer \nmodels of arable, forestry and silvoarable economics (Wojtkowski et al 1990; Thomas 1991; \nWillis et al. 1993; Dupraz et al. 1995; Nelson and Cramb 1998), there is less information \ndescribing the development of the models.  The development of a dynamic computer-based \nsimulation of silvoarable economics is time-consuming, and not aided by the paucity of \ndocumentation on existing computer models.  This paper aims to describe the process of \ndevelopment of an economic model, called Farm-SAFE, and discusses some of the key \nlessons learnt.   \n \nMethod \nWithin this paper, the development of an economic model of arable, forestry and agroforestry \nsystems is described as a sequential process with significant feedback loops (Figure 1).  The \nfirst action was to establish the purpose and desired features of the model with the key end-\nusers.  This was completed at the same time as a review of existing models.  The third step \nwas to develop an initial model, which was then modified in response to additional feedback \nthrough model use. \n \n  \n3 \n \n    \nFigure 1. Schematic diagram showing how the criteria for the model, the development of the model, \nand its use is affected by feedback from the end-users of the model. \n \n \nEstablishing the criteria for the model \nThe primary purpose of the model was to address a research objective of an EU-sponsored \nproject called \u201cSilvoarable Agroforestry for Europe\u201d which started in August 2001 and was \ncompleted in January 2005.  The specific aims of the project included reducing the \nuncertainties concerning the viability of silvoarable systems and the extrapolation of plot-\nscale results to individual farms (Dupraz et al. 2005).  The criteria for the model were agreed \nat a workshop meeting including researchers and end-users in September 2002.  The principal \nend-users were researchers and extension advisors in a range of countries including France, \nthe Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.  The agreed criteria for the model are categorised in \nTable 1 using the model characteristics described by Graves et al. (2005).  The criteria are \ncategorised under the headings of: 1) model background, 2) systems modelled, 3) objective of \nthe economic analysis, 4) viewpoint of the analysis, 5) spatial scale, 6) temporal scale, 7) \ngeneration and use of biophysical data, 8) model platform and interface, and 9) input \nrequirements and outputs generated.    \n \n \n  \n2.

The principal models examined were the Agroforestry \nCalculator (Agriculture Western Australia and Campbell White and Associates Pty Ltd, \n2000), the Agroforestry Estate Model (Knowles and Middlemiss, 1999), POPMOD (Thomas, \n1991), ARBUSTRA (Liagre, 1997) and the Water Nutrients and Light Capture in \nAgroforestry Systems model (WaNuLCAS) (Van Noordwijk and Lusiana, 1999, 2000, 2003).   \nUsing the criteria described in Table 1, it was possible to characterise the available models \nand these results have been described by Graves et al. (2005).    \n \nInitial development \nBased on existing plot- and farm-scale models \nAlthough it would have been possible to start from scratch, our philosophy was to build on \nexisting models.  Of the available models, it was eventually decided to use POPMOD \n(Thomas, 1991) and ARBUSTRA (Liagre, 1997) as a basis for new economic model.  \n5 \nPOPMOD provides an empirical model of tree and crop yields to inform the economics of \narable, silvoarable and poplar forestry systems at a one-hectare scale.  The ARBUSTRA \nmodel, whilst lacking an empirical model of tree and crop yields, allows analysis of different \ncombinations of agriculture\/agroforestry\/forestry systems within a \u201cfarm-level analysis\u201d \n(Figure 2).  These farm-scale features allow the analysis of the effect of different planting \npatterns and an assessment of the feasibility of introducing new systems in terms of capital \nand labour requirements (Table 2).   In addition the project team had free access to and \nexperience of using both these models and there were no copyright issues.  Even so, \nintegrating the two models involved substantial translation issues as the POPMOD model was \ndeveloped in English and the ARBUSTRA model was developed in French. \n \n \n \nFigure 2. A schematic representation of different spatial scales of modelling, the one-hectare, unit and \nfarm scale.  A one-hectare scale analysis may be used for unit-scale analysis which in turn may be \nused for farm scale analysis. \n \n \nTable 2.

Because the model \nwas to be used by research and extension organisations in different countries, the platform \nneeded to be readily available and\/or inexpensive.  It was also important that users could \noperate and modify the model themselves.  Hence, it seemed optimal to use a spreadsheet \nplatform, and specific software chosen was Microsoft \u00ae Excel.  This choice was also \ncoloured by the fact that the chosen POPMOD and ARBUSTRA model were also spreadsheet \nbased.  The decision to use a spreadsheet platform focussed on spreadsheet cell functions \nenabled the use of the model in different language versions (e.g. English, French, German, \nItalian, and Spanish).  Another advantage of using a widely-used spreadsheet programme was \nthe availability of add-on applications such as Crystal Ball\u00ae Risk Analysis Software and \nSolutions (Decisioneering\u00ae Incorporated, 2005), and Insight.xla 2.0, developed by \nAnalyCorp\u00ae (Savage, 2003).  These could be used to help in the optimization and uncertainty \nanalysis. \n \nForm of field-scale economic analysis \nVarious conceptual models of farm economics have been used depending on the \ncircumstances and objectives of the analysis.  Within the model, economic analyses were \ninitially undertaken at a one-hectare scale (Figure 2).  The financial value of each enterprise \nwas calculated in terms of a net margin (units: \u20ac ha-1) determined as the revenue (R; units: \u20ac \nha\n-1\n) minus variable costs (V; units: \u20ac ha-1) such as seed, fertilisers and sprays, and the \n\u201eassignable fixed costs\u201f of labour and machinery associated with the enterprise (A; units: \u20ac ha-\n1\n) (Equation 1).  A similar approach when comparing arable and forestry systems has \npreviously been used by Willis et al. (1993) and Burgess et al. (1999).   \n Net margin =  Equation 1 \nWhen comparing arable and forestry systems, whereas the costs and revenue from arable \nsystems take place within a 12-month period, the timber revenue from trees can occur many \nyears after the costs of establishment.  Since most people have a preference for immediate \nincome, there is an opportunity cost to immobilizing capital in long-term projects.  Within the \nmodel, future benefits and costs were therefore reduced or \u201cdiscounted\u201d using the approach \ndeveloped by Faustmann (1849) to value forestry investments.  The net present value (NPV; \nunits: \u20ac ha-1) was therefore calculated using Equation 2 where the revenue (Rt), variable costs \n(Vt), and assignable fixed costs (At) are specified for each year (t) over a time horizon of T \n(years), and i is the discount rate (Equation 2):  \n \n Equation 2 \nIn addition in order to compare systems including tree species with different rotations, the \nmodel was also developed to calculate an infinite NPV (NPVInfinite; units: \u20ac ha\n-1\n).  This is the \nNPV defined over an infinite time horizon, in which each replication has a rotation of n years.  \nIt is defined (Equation 3) as: \n \n Equation 3 \nThe NPV was also expressed as an annuity, termed the \u201cequivalent annual value\u201d (EAV; units: \n\u20ac ha-1 a-1) (Equation 4): \nAVR \uf02d\uf02d\n\uf0e5\n\uf03d\n\uf03d \uf02b\n\uf02d\uf02d\n\uf03d\nTt\nt\nt\nttt\ni\nAVR\nNPV\n0 )1(\n)(\n1)1(\n)1(\n\uf02d\uf02b\n\uf02b\n\uf03d\nn\nn\nInfinite\ni\ni\nNPVNPV\n7 \n EAV = NPVInfinite \uf0b4 i Equation 4 \n \n \nStructure of the model \nThe philosophy in building the model was to develop distinct worksheets to contain the key \ncomponents of the economic analysis (Figure 3; Table 3).  The primary worksheet was called \n\u201cOption and results\u201d and this functioned as the control worksheet for selecting the appropriate \ninputs and presenting the results.  This structure also simplified loading and simulation of \ndifferent scenarios because each scenario could be saved, rather than needing manual input \neach time it was used.  The input worksheets comprised three physical yield templates \nlabelled \u201cArablesystem\u201d, \u201cForestrysystem\u201d, and \u201cAgroforestrysystem\u201d.  There were also four \nfinancial templates labelled \u201cArablefinance\u201d, \u201cTreevalue\u201d, \u201cTreegrant\u201d, and \u201cTreecost\u201d.

The user was required to specify \nthe area of each land unit (alu; units: ha) and this was assumed to remain constant.  For \nexample a farm may comprise one land unit of 50 ha of sandy soil and a second land unit of \n100 ha of a clay soil.   \n \nIn a simple comparison of forestry or silvoarable enterprises a single planting year can be \nassumed.  However if all the planting on a large farm took place in a single year, this could \ncause serious disruptions to farm cash-flow and the demand for labour.   Hence the economic \nmodel was designed to allow the analysis of phased planting schemes where the user could \nspecify that a certain area or proportion of land was planted to forestry and\/or silvoarable \nagroforestry in each year.  In any particularly year (t), new areas of forestry (anewfor: units: ha) \nand silvoarable agroforestry (anewsil; units: ha) could be planted assuming that the total did not \nexceed the total area of the land unit (alu).  As the rotation proceeds, forestry (afellfor: units: ha) \nand silvoarable (afellsil; units: ha) plots may also be \u201cclear-felled\u201d in each year.  The area of \nforestry (afor: units: ha) (Equation 5) and silvoarable agroforestry (asil; units: ha) (Equation 6) \nplots in year t is therefore obtained by adding the area of new planting and subtracting the \nareas of clear-felled systems.   \n9 \n \n                                          Equation 5 \n \n                                          Equation 6 \n \nLastly the revenue and costs of up to four units were aggregated in a worksheet labelled \n\u201cFarm\u201d which also included the fixed costs of the farm (F; units: \u20ac farm-1).  Thus, the NPV of \nthe farm (NPVfarm; units:  \u20ac farm\n-1\n) (Equation 7) can be expressed as: \n \n \n            \n                    \n       \n               \n      \n   \n    \n   \n      \n  \n      \n   \n     \n \n Equation 7 \n \nWhere:  l is one of four possible land units, Nar, Nfor, and Nsil is the net margin (\u20ac ha\n-1\n) of the \narable, forestry and silvoarable enterprises respectively in each land unit l in year t.  The other \ninputs include     ,      , and       as the area (ha) of the arable, forestry, and silvoarable \nsystems respectively in each land unit l in year t, Ft is the farm fixed cost in year t (\u20ac farm\n-1\n), \nand T is the time horizon (years).   A farm infinite NPV (\u20ac farm-1) and a farm EAV (\u20ac farm-1 a-\n1\n) were also calculated with Equations 3 and 4 respectively.    \n \nThe results for the one-hectare-, unit- and farm-scale calculations of timber and crop \nproduction, undiscounted and discounted cash flows, land and labour requirements were \ntabulated as single numerical totals for the final year of the rotation in the \u201cOptions and \nresults\u201d worksheet along with other criterion such as the NPV, infinite NPV, and EAV (Table \n3).   \n \nFeedback from using the model \nAn initial version of the plot-scale economic model was developed within the first twelve \nmonths of the project, and a farm-scale model was developed soon after.  However the model \ncontinued to be developed through the project by an iterative process of use and refinement.  \nThis was greatly aided by the development of a project website, which was used to store the \nproject outputs and provided a forum where discussion of all aspects of the project could take \nplace.  For example, the initial version of the model with a description of the model and \nsample exercises was placed on the project website, so that project members could use the \nmodel and provide feedback.  During the project, some of the key issues included the naming \nof the model, the generation and\/or collation of the physical and economic data for the model, \nthe inclusion of specific field operations, and improved ways of presenting the outputs (Table \n4). \n  \n10 \nTable 4.

A \nnumber of models were developed within the SAFE project and it was decided that the model \nname should make reference to the overall project.   It was finally agreed that the plot- and \nfarm-scale economic model would be called Farm-SAFE (Figure 4). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 4. Schematic diagram showing the relationship between the two biophysical models, one bio-\neconomic model and an economic model. \n \n \nFarm-SAFE \nYield-SAFE \n                         Plot-SAFE \nHi-SAFE \nFarm-scale \nEconomic analysis \nBiophysical analysis Plot-scale \nEconomic analysis \n11 \nThe original plan was that the economic model would use crop and tree yield data developed \nfrom a detailed stand-alone agroforestry model called Hi-SAFE.  However 18 months into the \nproject, it became clear that this biophysical model would not be available before the end of \nthe project.  Hence it proved necessary to develop a less detailed spreadsheet-based \nbiophysical model to provide the crop and tree yield data needed for the economic analysis.  \nThis model, called Yield-SAFE, is described by van der Werf et al. (2007).   In theory it \nwould have been possible to develop a farm-scale model incorporating the Yield-SAFE \nmodel.  However excessive computer memory requirements meant that it was more efficient \nto develop a plot-based bio-economic model called Plot-SAFE which then provided the plot-\nscale yield, revenue and cost data needed for the farm-scale analysis.  \n \nCollation of the financial data \nSome economic models, such as ARBUSTRA, require the user to enter the specific revenue \nand cost data for each considered system.  However to simplify the process, it was clear at an \nearly stage that \u201cdefault\u201d production and financial data should be provided for the key arable, \nagroforestry and forestry systems.  These data were characterised by unique \u201cidentifiers\u201d \ncontaining details of the country, region, and tree and crop type.  To collate these data, \nfinancial data templates were sent to the end-users at an early stage in the project, and this \nwas followed up by workshops with farmers and end-users in selected regions.   \n \nWithin the \u201cArablefinance\u201d worksheet is was generally possible to collate national or regional \ndata on the anticipated revenue and subsidies, and the variable and assignable fixed costs \nassociated with arable production.  Where there was not possible, the costs were entered as an \naggregate value.  Within the \u201cTreevalue\u201d worksheet, the value of timber per unit volume was \nrelated to the size of the timber as timber value (\u20ac m-3) typically increases as the volume of \nwood increases (range: 0.01 m\n3\n to 4 m\n3\n) (Figure 5).  Where appropriate, price data relating to \nfirewood (\u20ac m-3) and any other tree by-products (\u20ac t-1) were also included.  The grants \nassociated with tree establishment and management, and loss of associated agricultural \nincome, were included in the \u201cTreegrant\u201d worksheet.  During the project it became clear that \nthe grants vary widely both between and within countries in the EU and it was necessary to \nformat the template to accommodate the different procedures.  The \u201cTreecost\u201d worksheet \nrequired data on the costs related to tree management, and also the management of the \nunderstorey vegetation within the agroforestry systems.  \n \n \nFigure 5.

In such situations \nit is appropriate to examine the economics of the system assuming that the arable cropping \nceases.   Hence within the model, a feature was developed within the \u201cOptions and Results\u201d \nworksheet to allow the user to set either a financial or physical threshold for the arable crop.  \nTo facilitate this, a crop-optimisation worksheet was added (Table 3) to calculate the optimal \nrotation length.   Associated with the cessation of arable cropping, a common practice is to \nestablish a grass sward below the base of the trees.  Hence within the model, the option exists \nto specify a time to establish such a sward, together with specification of the associated labour \ncost (units: \u20ac h-1), labour requirement (units: hr ha-1 sward) and the cost of materials (units: \u20ac \nha\n-1\n sward).  The model was also modified to include the cost of sward maintenance in each \nsubsequent year. \n \nCropped area varying during rotation  In widely-spaced silvoarable system, a farmer can \nalso choose to reduce the proportion of the area cultivated in a specific year as the trees get \nlarger.  To account for this, an option was included within the \u201cOptions and Results\u201d \nworksheet to define the relative area planted as a proportion of the total system.  This value \n(fc) is typically 1 in conventional arable systems and somewhere between 0 and 1 in a \nsilvoarable system.  Because the default physical and financial data relating to the arable and \nsilvoarable crops are expressed on a per cropped area basis, the final net margin of the arable \ncrop (Nc) in year t must be multiplied by the proportion of area planted (Equation 8): \n  \n )( AVRfN cc \uf02d\uf02d\uf03d  Equation 8 \n \nReplacement of dead trees In practice on many farms a certain proportion of trees will die in \nthe initial years after planting, and their replacement can represent a significant cost.  Hence \nthe model was modified so that the user can define a  number of years after tree establishment \n(Tper) when a user-defined mortality rate (m: \u22650, \u22641) is applied to all trees in the first year \nafter planting.  In each year t, it is assumed that the number of replacement trees, termed \n\u201cbeat-ups\u201d (\uf072b), was dependent on the number of trees planted (\uf072pl) the previous year (t-1) \n(Equation 9).  Therefore: \n If , then   otherwise  Equation 9 \n \nPruning  In some silvoarable systems it can be profitable to side-prune the trees to maximise \nthe volume of high-value, knot-free timber (Burgess et al. 2003).  The length of the tree trunk \nwithout branches is called the \u201cbole\u201d.  Within the model, the years in which pruning occurs \ncan be selected by the user or calculated automatically.  Where calculated automatically, the \nbole height in a given year n ((Hbole)n; units: m) was calculated as the sum of the bole height at \nplanting ((Hbole)t=0; units m) and the sum of the pruning height increments since planting \n(Equation 10): \n   Equation 10 \nIn the automated procedure, pruning was only assumed to occur if the last bole height plus a \ndefined pruning height increment did not exceed a user-defined maximum pruning height or a \nperr TT \uf0a3 \uf028 \uf029 mtplb 1\uf02d\uf03d \uf072\uf072 0\uf03db\uf072\n\uf028 \uf029 \uf0e5\n\uf03d\n\uf03d\n\uf03d\n\uf044\uf02b\uf03d\nnt\nt\nboletbolenbole\nHHH\n0\n0\n)(\n13 \nmaximum proportion of the total tree height.  In addition a series of calculations were \nundertaken to estimate the labour cost when pruning occured.  To do this the labour \nrequirement to prune at a minimum and maximum height was defined, and the labour \nrequirements at intermediate heights were interpolated.  The cost of pruning per hectare in \neach year was then calculated as the product of the labour requirement (Lt; units: minutes), a \ncost of labour for pruning (\u20ac minute-1), and the stand density (\u03c1). \n \nOutput analysis \nCreation of graphical outputs  The initial model was developed to give tabulated results \n(Figure 6) comprising real and discounted values of grant revenue, non-grant revenue and \ncosts for the arable, forestry, and silvoarable enterprises at a one-hectare-, unit-, and farm-\nscale.  The results also included the associated labour requirements.  Experience with using \nthe model showed that it was often also useful to compare the results graphically, especially if \ncomparing outputs such as cash flow or yields that varied over time (Figure 7).  Similarly \ngraphical representation was useful for examining how land use patterns might develop over \ntime given certain planting schemes (Figure 8) and the feasibility of meeting the labour \nrequirements associated with introducing silvoarable or forestry systems with a phased \nplanting scheme (Figure 9).   \n \n \n \nFigure 6.

An example graphical result of the change in land use from a simulation of an arable, \nforestry and silvoarable system over a 60 year period in Champdeniers in France. \n \n \n \nFigure 9.  An example graphical result of the changes in labour use from a simulation of an arable, \nforestry and silvoarable system over a 60 year period in Champdeniers in France. \n \nExamining the dynamic resource use implications of different systems may help farmers \ndecide what is feasible.  For example, in Figure 7, it is evident that the cumulative cash flows \nof the agroforestry and forestry systems are lower for much of the time than for the arable \nsystem, posing a challenge to farmers who want to adopt them.  Farmers may also wish to \nconsider how land use is altered over time between different land uses under different \nplanting patterns, because this has different land use and resource use implications (Figure 8).  \nWhilst arable systems are typified by consistent patterns of labour use, agroforestry and \nforestry systems are variable in their labour requirements.  Farmers may want to consider how \nchanging patterns of land use affect the pattern of labour requirements.  Such requirements \ncan prove to be a challenge, given that they are often characterises by high peaks and troughs \n(Figure 9).   \n \nSensitivity to changes in yields, prices and costs  One of the advantages of developing an \neconomic model is the ability for the user to determine the sensitivity of the outputs to \nspecific inputs (Figure 10).  Within the Farm-SAFE model, user-defined changes to the \nrelative value (typically a proportion between 0 and 2) of yields, grants, prices, labour \nrequirements, and costs for the crop or tree components can be modelled from a specified \nyear.  Typically, different NPVs for corresponding levels of relative variation in the specified \ninput are then derived.  A second option within Farm-SAFE is to examine the effect of a \ngradual change in a specified input (in Europe, typically a proportion between -0.1 and 0.1) \nover the entire duration of the rotation.  This is useful if a consistent change in a given input is \nanticipated, for example, for the cost of labour or the price of timber.   \n16 \n \nIn Figure 10 which shows the NPVs of an arable, forestry, and agroforesty system under \ndifferent discount rates, it is evident that lower discount rates (where the percentage change \non the x axis is negative) correspond to high NPV for the agroforestry and forestry systems, \nwhilst higher discount rates (where the percentage change on the x axis is positive) \ncorrespond to high NPVs for the arable system.  The opportunity cost of capital invested in \nagroforestry or forestry systems is therefore an important consideration in adopting long-term \nsystems.   \n \n \n \nFigure 10.  An example graphical result showing how discount rates affect the NPV of an arable, \nforestry and silvoarable system over a 60 year period in Champdeniers in France. \n \nDiscussion \nIt is now about five years since we originally created Farm-SAFE and a good time to reflect \non what worked well in its development and what was challenging.   \n \nThe development of Farm-SAFE was a collaborative success drawing on the knowledge and \nexpertise of researchers, end-users, and field practitioners in different European countries.  \nThe model continues currently to be used in a number of European countries as well as further \nafield.  For the reader\u201fs information, copies of the Farm-SAFE model and related \ndocumentation can be obtained free of charge from the corresponding author (contact: A.R. \nGraves: a.graves@cranfield.ac.uk).  Documentation on the Farm-SAFE model can also be \ndownloaded from: http:\/\/www.cranfield.ac.uk\/sas\/nsri\/research\/projects\/farmsafe.html \nand further information on the SAFE project is available from the SAFE project website at:    \nhttp:\/\/www.ensam.inra.fr\/safe\/ \n17 \n \nWorking with the end-users to clearly establish the criteria for the model, and specifically \nrecording this as a project document, was a particularly useful exercise.  This allowed us to \nbenefit from the expertise of previous model developers within the team as well as to \naccommodate the concerns and interests of agroforestry practitioners and enthusiasts.  The \ndocument was saved and circulated to members of the project team and end-users.  Whilst is \nserved as a reference document, the criteria in it were modified as time went on, as new \ninsight and needs emerged.   \n \nThis interaction with end-users was completed at the same time as a review of existing \nmodels, which was also used to develop the criteria for plot- and farm-scale modelling \n(Graves et al., 2005).  This review was especially important since it allowed us to borrow and \ndevelop concepts that would be useful and important within our own modelling activities.   \n \nWe also reviewed the more general international literature on agroforestry, looking in \nparticular at the criteria that influenced farmer use and adoption of agroforestry systems.  A \nrecurring theme within this is that NPV is not necessarily a criterion of evaluation for \nadoption, but that a variety of other socio-economic factors, such as the scale of initial \ninvestments, labour requirements and low initial cash flows can influence farmer decision-\nmaking (e.g. Nelson and Cramb 1998; 1998; Pannel, 1999; Graves et al., 2003).  Such issues \nare challenging and can result in low levels of adoption and use (Mercer et al. 1998).  These \nactivities allowed us to build on what was considered to be important in the adoption and use \nof agroforestry systems and as far as possible, to ignore what was not considered to be \nimportant.  For example, particular efforts were made to provide graphical time-series outputs \nof cash flow, labour requirements, and land use.   \n \nIn the context of the SAFE project, we needed a robust workable biophysical model to \nprovide time series growth data of tree and crop growth.  In our particular case, the original \nplan of using a new detailed biophysical model did not materialise in time and it was \nnecessary to develop a parameter-sparse biophysical model of arable, forestry and silvoarable \nyields (van der Werf et al., 2007) to provide Farm-SAFE with the growth data.  With \nhindsight, the development of such a model at an earlier stage would have been useful.  \n \nThis was a pan-European project with economic analyses being undertaken in France, \nGermany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and the UK.  We were fortunate that, with the \nexception of the UK, all of the nations used a common currency.  This simplified storage of \nthe data, since this could then be done easily in a common currency, making it possible to \nmake cross-border pan-European comparisons of the results.   \n \nThe development of economic data is time consuming, and an advantage of collecting the data \nin a series of databases within the model is that this has ensured that the data is kept within \nthe model for future use, ensuring that it does not become separated from the model for which \nit is intended.  Most users seek quick answers to their questions as well as the possibility of \nrunning many different scenarios.  Hence the capacity for a user to select from a database of \nrecords, for example, \u201cwheat production in the UK\u201d, and thereby obtain a completed template \nof the key crop prices and costs was very useful, particularly given the large number of inputs.   \n \nBy giving the model the capacity to store collections of data records, it was also possible to \nstore scenarios, so that for example, all the physical and economic records for given arable, \nforestry, and silvoarable systems in a particular location could be retrieved from the various \ndatabases within the model by using the unique record identifiers to retrieve the data.  This \n18 \nallowed many thousands of simulations to be run, a process that towards the end to the project \nwas facilated through the development of Visual Basic routines that were used to \nautomatically retrieve and manipulate data for scenario analysis.    \n \nThe process of continual circulation and iterative development of the model and interaction \nwith the end-users of the model results was essential.  The most recent version of the model \nwas often passed to various members of the project in different parts of Europe via the \nInternet, so that they could develop some particular feature of the model, or error check the \nmodel.  In this respect strong co-ordination of the project was important, in particular as \nmembers of the scientific team were located in several countries.  The fact that this was a long \nproject, with regular meetings organised around Europe, workshops and a travel budget \nfacilitated the process of model development through the interaction of model developers and \nboth research oriented and field practitioner end-users of the model.  Of particular importance \nwas regular contact with field-practitioners and farmers with actual experience of \nagroforestry.  This provided many important insights that were built into the capability of the \nmodel.   \n \nIn addition to this, an important feature of the SAFE project was an extensive pan-European \nsurvey of farmers\u201f responses to the concept of silvoarable agroforestry which allowed us to \nbuild in to the model particular features of concern to them. For example we were able to \ndevelop options to describe one-off changes in subsidy regimes or gradual changes in \nparticular prices and costs over specific periods of time.   Iterative and cyclical improvement \nof Farm-SAFE was essential, because the model was required to work in vastly different \ncircumstances and because user-requirements and understanding of the systems being \nmodelled constantly increased over the duration of the SAFE project.  A project website \ngreatly aided the development of Farm-SAFE, by facilitating the transfer of new ideas for it.   \n \nIn terms of challenges, it is worth noting that on an international project, it is possible that any \nnew model has to meet a large number of requirements.  This can make the model complex \nand thought will need to be given to the level of complexity that can be reasonably dealt with \nin a single model.  We found ourselves developing a number of features that were not \nsubsequently used.  This was time-consuming and added to the complexity of the interface.  \nClearly, establishing the true likelihood of use of a new feature is important.  This also applies \nto simulation runs.  Whilst developing automated routines within the model enabled \nthousands of simulations to be generated, these then became far too extensive to interpret and \nwrite up.  Indeed it subsequently transpired that the important findings were in fact evident \nfrom a relatively few strategically selected scenarios.   \n \nIt is worth noting that beyond being able to allocate high discount rates, risk has not been \nexplicitly developed in the model, although it is something that is of considerable importance \nto farmers and other potential investors in agroforestry systems.  Such risks might include the \nloss of the systems to fire, flood, or wind damage.  In terms of possible future developments, \nthis might be achieved through use of Monte-Carlo simulation.  The model could also be used \nto model the welfare impacts of carbon sequestration or emissions from the different systems.  \nThis indeed might be a precursor to developing Farm-SAFE from a mirco-economic financial \nanalysis model into a macro-economic cost-benefit analysis model that can account for the \nwider social implications of arable, agroforestry, and forestry systems. Finally, in purely \npractical terms, the development of a graphical user interface is likely to aid user interaction \nwith the underlying model and its features, possibly allowing a wider audience to make use of \nit.   \n19 \nConclusion \nAgroforestry is receiving renewed interest as a potential land use system in Europe.  \nHowever, understanding of the economic and social implications of agroforestry systems is \nlimited.  This description of the inputs, formulae, structure, and practical issues linked to \nFarm-SAFE and its development will aid those intending to take this research effort forwards.   \n \nOur work started with a review of literature and existing models, and the collection of ideas \nfrom colleagues and end-users to develop our initial criteria for the model.  A common \nconceptual framework, the net margin, was used to compare the long-term benefits of the \ndifferent systems using the NPV, as well as a series of other time-series indicators, allowing \nusers to compare the profitability and feasibility of arable, forestry, and silvoarable systems.  \nThe development of Farm-SAFE in a commonly available modelling platform facilitated its \ntransfer and use between different members of the project team and subsequent users of the \nmodel.   \n \nIterative and cyclical improvement of Farm-SAFE was essential, because understanding of \nuser-requirements and the systems being modelled constantly increased over the duration of \nthe SAFE project.  A project website greatly aided the development of Farm-SAFE, by \nhelping to transfer the model and ideas for it between colleagues on the project.  The model \nwas often passed to different members of the team to develop particular features and error \ncheck the model.  However, major periods of progress also occurred during collective work \non Farm-SAFE during project workshops.  For this reason, it was critical that the project team \nwere able to draw on adequate funds that enabled this interaction over an extended period of \ntime.   \n \nFuture improvements to Farm-SAFE will include consideration of risk within the model as \nwell as a wider consideration of the relative benefits of the different land use systems, starting \nsince Farm-SAFE makes use of annual time-step biophysical data, with an analysis of the \nwelfare provided by carbon sequestration and leading to a full cost benefit analysis of the \nsocial costs and benefits of the different systems.  At a practical level, the development of an \nimproved interface could help a wider audience to make use of Farm-SAFE.  \n \nAcknowledgements \nWe are very grateful for the reviewers\u201f feedback and suggestions.
