Introduction\nFlood basalt sequences are found on volcanic rifted\nmargins where the positions of mantle melting an-\nomalies are coincident with the rifted margin (such\nas the North Atlantic Igneous Province, Parana\u02dc-\nEtendeka: e.g. Jerram & Widdowson, 2005). They\nare significant, as the provinces contain enormous\nvolumes of lava; for instance, the North Atlantic\nIgneous Province (NAIP), is estimated to have a volume\nof 1.8 \u00d7 106 km3 covering an area of 1.3 \u00d7 106 km2\n(Eldholm & Grue, 1994), with a significant amount of\nthe lava sequences being found offshore. Additionally,\nthe flood basalts may cover pre-existing sedimentary\nbasins, and in many cases these basins have proven\nhydrocarbon reserves in areas not covered by basalt\nwhere conventional geophysical exploration methods\ncan be used (e.g. Naylor et al. 1999). Interest shown in\nsuch basins has focused on volcanic passive margins,\nparticularly the Faroe Islands, Rockall andV\u00f8ring areas\nand the distribution and characterization of sub-surface\nvolcanic successions (e.g. Fliedner & White, 2003;\nWhite et al. 2003). An understanding of the internal\nfacies relationships within the lavas will provide\n\u2020Author for correspondence: D.A.Jerram@dur.ac.uk\n\u2021Present address: Senior Geologist, Det norske oljeselskap ASA,\nP.O. Box 2070 Vika, NO-0125 Oslo, Norway\nvaluable information on how the provinces built up\nthrough time and may also help quantify the extent\nof hyaloclastites and sedimentary sequences beneath,\nwhich are notoriously difficult to image seismically due\nto their flood basalt cover (Jerram, 2002; Spitzer et al.\n2005).\nIn order to understand better the 3D distribution of\nthe significant lava sequences offshore, flood basalt\nfacies schemes and 3D mapping have been developed\nfrom seismic studies (e.g. Planke,Alvestad&Skogseid,\n1999; Planke et al. 2000, 2005; Thomson, 2005) and\ndetailed field studies of onshore successions of flood\nbasalts and their associated sediments (e.g. Jerram,\nMountney & Stollhofen, 1999; Mountney et al. 1999;\nJerram et al. 1999; Jerram, 2002; Single & Jerram,\n2004). Recent research interest has focused on being\nable to understand the 3D facies distribution of the lavas\nusing their geophysical properties (Planke, Alvestad\n& Skogseid, 1999; Nelson et al. 2009). To improve\nsub-basalt imaging, research has focused on studies\nusing long offset data (Fliedner & White, 2003),\nlow frequencies (e.g. Ziolkowski et al. 2003), the\nconstruction of complex 2D and 3D models (e.g.\nMartini et al. 2005), the application of additional\nimaging techniques such as magnetotelluric inversion\n(Hautot et al. 2007) and the development of multi-\nmethod schemes such as joint inversion of gravity,\n354 D. A. JERRAM AND OTHERS\nmagnetotelluric and seismic data (e.g. Jegen-Kulcsar\n& Hobbs, 2005).\nIn this contribution, we have used known onshore\nvolcanic facies from flood basalt sequences to interpret\nthe offshore flood basalt sequence in a case study from\nthe Faroe\u2013Shetland Basin (the GFA 99 seismic data-\nset). Firstly, we briefly introduce the onshore geology\nof the Faroe Islands Basalt Group with examples of the\ntypes of volcanic facies preserved. The interpretation of\nthe offshore sequence is then presented concentrating\non the key volcanic sequences. These sequences are\nconstrained using a combination of seismic facies and\ngravitymodelling. The finalmodel highlights the facies\ndistribution of the key volcanic horizons and sheds light\nupon their evolution through time, with a significant\nportion of the sequences represented by hyaloclastites\nerupted into a deep water body which must have been\npresent during the onset of flood volcanism.\n2. The geology of the Faroe Islands Basalt Group\nThe location of the Faroe Islands and the significant\noffshore distribution of the lava cover in the Faroe\u2013\nShetland Basin are given in Figure 1. The sub-volcanic\nplays here are considered to be prospective and worthy\nof exploration (e.g. Waagstein, 1988; Laier, J\u00f8rgensen\n& Isaksen, 1997; Ziska & Andersen, 2005), and hence\nhave attracted seismic acquisition over the offshore\nparts of the lava cover, and drilling in the onshore lava\nsequence (e.g. Boldreel, 2006).\nThe igneous succession in the Faroe Islands was\nerupted during Palaeogene times prior to the opening\nof the NE Atlantic (e.g. Jolley, 2009 and references\ntherein). The lavas are all geochemically tholeiitic,\nwhich suggests that their eruptionwas coincidentwith a\nhigh degree of partialmelting of themantle (Waagstein,\n1988). The group consists of seven formations (see\nPassey & Bell, 2007), of which four formations\nare composed of significant thicknesses of volcanic\nrocks (Fig. 1): (1) Enni Formation, (2) Malinstindur\nFormation, (3) Beinisv\u00f8r\u203a Formation and (4) Lopra\nFormation.\nThe additional formations are related to relatively\nthin sedimentary and volcaniclastic interbeds (Passey\n& Bell, 2007), which unusually occur high up in the\nlava sequence in the Faroe Islands (Fig. 1), whereas\nelsewhere, sedimentary interlayers are often restricted\nto the basal part of flood basalt sequences observed\nin many onshore examples (e.g. Jerram & Stollhofen,\n2002; Petry et al. 2007), where the active sedimentary\nenvironment gets invaded and overtaken by the volcanic\nsystem (Jerram et al. 2000).\nThe gross thickness of the volcanic succession in\nthe Faroe Islands is thought to be 6500\u20137000 m, of\nwhich 3000 m are observed above sea-level (Ellis et al.\n2002; Passey & Bell, 2007). The onshore distribution\nof the formations is shown in Figure 1b. The Faroe\nIslands Basalt Group is considered to have erupted\nbetween c. 60.56 and 57.5 Ma (Ellis et al. 2002),\nhowever, the dating is poorly constrained above the\nBeinisv\u00f8r\u203a Formation. The Beinisv\u00f8r\u203a Formation is\noverlain by the Prestfjall Formation (previously termed\nthe coal-bearing sequence), which consists of coal-\nbearing sedimentary units and was originally dated at\naround 57.5 Ma (Ellis et al. 2002). The most recent\nreview of the dates for the onset and cessation of the\nFaroe Islands lava field, however, places the Prestfjall\nFormation at about 55 Ma (see Jolley, 2009) with errors\nof \u00b1 0.5 Ma, and suggests an onset of volcanism more\nlikely around 57 Ma based on correlations across the\nNAIP.\n2.a. The onshore succession\nThe onshore succession of the Faroe Islands Basalt\nGroup is exposed throughout the archipelago (Fig. 2)\nand has been sampled to considerable depth through the\nLopra 1\/1A borehole. Based on the detailed borehole\ndata through the Faroe Islands Basalt Group from\nthe water-borne volcaniclastics observed deep in the\nLopra-1\/1A borehole to the Enni Formation observed\nonshore on Streymoy and Eysturoy, the two largest\nislands of the Faroe Islands chain, it is possible to\nconstruct a schematic facies section through the whole\nFaroes lava sequence (Fig. 3). This succession is\nhighlighted below:\nThe Beinisv\u00f8r\u203a Formation and Lopra Formation\nrepresent the oldest volcanic rocks in the sequence. The\nBeinisv\u00f8r\u203a Formation has a thickness of over 900 m\nonshore and occurs on the islands of Mykines, Su\u203auroy\nand Va\u00b4gar (see Fig. 1). On Su\u203auroy the Lopra-1\/1A\nborehole failed to reach the base of the lava succession\nat a drilling depth of 3565 m (Hald & Waagstein,\n1984). On the Faroe Islands, the top of the Beinisv\u00f8r\u203a\nFormation is marked by a sedimentary sequence: the\nPrestfjall Formation. This hiatus in the eruptive activity\nis represented by the deposition of lacustrine sediments\nand the development of a thick coal sequence which\nhas been mined. This zone is approximately 10 m\nin thickness, but has been noted to be locally up\nto 15 m (Rasmussen & Noe-Nygaard, 1970). The\nformation has been geochronologically constrained by\nthe use of combined palynological and isotopic dating\nto the age range c. 60.56\u201357.5 Ma by Jolley, Clarke &\nKelley (2002), and some of the deepest lavas drilled\nin Lopra-1\/1A have been constrained by Waagstein,\nGuise & Rex (2002) at c. 58.8 \u00b1 0.5 Ma (1\u03c3 ) by\nAr\/Ar whole rock dating. These dates may be slightly\nyounger when regional correlations are used (Jolley,\n2009).\nThe Malinstindur Formation volcanic rocks have a\nthickness of about 1350 m estimated from onshore\noutcrop on the Faroe Islands (Passey & Bell, 2007).\nThe complete succession may be seen from its base\non the island of Va\u00b4gar in the west, to Eysturoy\nand other islands in the east. It starts with olivine\u2013\nphyric compound lava flows and passes upwards to\nplagioclase\u2013phyric compound flows (e.g. Figs 2b, 3).\nAdditionally, within the olivine flows, two different\nOffshore flood basalt sequences 355\nFigure 1.

(c) Schematic log and approximate thickness of\nthe stratigraphy on the Faroe Islands, including the Lopra-1\/1A information.\nolivine\u2013phyric suites can be identified geochemically\n(low-TiO2 and high-TiO2) (see Waagstein, 1988;\nRasmussen & Noe-Nygaard, 1970).\nThe Enni Formation consists of a mixture of simple\nand compound lava flows, with a remnant thickness\nof 900 m with a few hundred metres removed due to\nerosion (Ellis et al. 2002; Passey&Bell, 2007) (Figs 2e,\n3). The Enni Formation is considered to have erupted\nduring magnetic chron C24R (Waagstein, 1988), which\nplaces this activity into a cycle of eruptive activity\nwhich occurred prior to the opening of the NE Atlantic\nOcean.\n3. Seismic interpretation of offshore\nvolcanic sequence\nIn this study, the offshore succession was interpreted\nusing the character and geometry of the seismic\nreflections, combined with the understanding of facies\narchitectures of flood volcanic rocks developed from\nstudies of onshore exposures from key flood basalt\nsequences, such as the NAIP and the Etendeka\nprovince of Namibia (Planke, Alvestad & Skogseid,\n1999; Jerram, 2002; Single & Jerram, 2004; Jerram\n& Widdowson, 2005; Nelson et al. 2009). Precise\nidentification of boundaries is difficult on seismic\nreflection data because of the complex scattering and\nabsorption of the seismic energy by the heterogeneous\nbasalts. Figure 4a highlights an example of the well-\nlog data available through lava sequences and the\ninformation that we can gain in terms of rock properties\n(Fig. 4b) for the different volcanic facies that occur\nin flood basalts (Nelson et al. 2009). The velocity\nrange of different internal facieswithin flood basalt lava\nsequences is given in Figure 4b, and this has been used\nto guide the velocity models used in this contribution;\nfor the lava flows (tabular and compound) we use a\nvelocity of 4000 m s\u22121, and for hyaloclastites we use\n3500 m s\u22121.\nIn this study we will use the following terminology\nto describe the major lava sequences that we can\nidentify in the GFA 99 data from the Faroe\u2013Shetland\nbasin: (1) Lava sequence 1 \u2013 the uppermost lavas as\nidentified by characteristic seismic signatures; (2) Lava\nsequence 2 \u2013 the middle section of lavas as identified by\ncharacteristic seismic signatures; (3) Lava sequence 3 \u2013\nlowermost volcanic rocks identified using seismic and\ngravity, and (4) Hyaloclastite apron \u2013 representing a\nlarge palaeo-waterbody found in the eastern side of the\noffshore data identified using pro-grading foresets on\nseismic data. The interpretation and modelling of the\nfacies of the Faroe Islands Basalt Group offshore in this\nstudy is concentrated across the area of the commercial\nGFA-99 seismic data which lies approximately 60 km\n356 D.

The main\nfocuses of the study are the volcanic sequences in the\ndata. The sedimentary overburden has been grouped\ninto the upper sediments, equivalent to post-Oligocene\noverburden, and the lower sediments, equivalent to an\nEocene\u2013Oligocene package (e.g. Davies et al. 2004);\nthis is indicated on the figures and aids in the gravity\nmodelling. The following section studies the offshore\ninterpretation of the volcanic rocks through theGFA-99\ndataset: how the sequence is recognized in the seismic\ndata, the facies interpretations and the estimated\nthicknesses present within this part of the NAIP\nflood basalts. To aid the description of the volcanic\nrocks, three interpreted sections through lines 105, 107,\n109 are presented in Figure 5.\n3.a. Lava sequence 1\nThe top of the lava sequence 1 is recognized by a\nlaterally extensive reflection. This reflection starts at\nabout 1580 ms TWT in the west of seismic line 105\nand at a similar time in each of the other W\u2013E seismic\nlines of 107 and 109. The reflection is characterized by\nbeing the strongest amplitude reflection below that of\nthe sea bed, and by the rugose nature of its top surface.\nThe top lava sequence 1 pick is heavily affected by the\nEocene to Miocene compressional phases associated\nwith changes in the spreading dynamics of the NE\nAtlantic (Boldreel & Andersen 1993), and the surface\nis faulted in much of the GFA-99 area. A characteristic\nfeature of the top lava sequence 1 is the presence of\nthrust faults that pierce the surface and the presence of\nassociated thrust-tip folds (e.g. see Fig. 5a).\nThe gently dipping lava sequence 1 volcanic rocks\ncover over 9.4 \u00d7 103 km2 of the dataset area and follow\nthe general structural dip towards the SE into the\nOffshore flood basalt sequences 357\nFigure 3.

The Faroe Islands\nBasalt Group is at its shallowest in the north of the\nGFA-99 area where the lava sequence 1 is interpreted\nto be close to the sea floor.\n3.a.1. Thickness\nThe lava sequence 1 succession maintains a reasonably\nconstant thickness of about 1000 m (500 ms TWT)\nacross most of the study area, apart from where the\nformation feathers out towards the south and east.\nThe interval is mainly composed of parallel, laterally\npersistent reflections, except for in the southwest,where\na divergent reflection sequence is observed to dip down\ninto the region of the Corona Basin. In the north\nand west of the lines, the entire thickness of the lava\nsequence 1 succession consists of parallel, laterally\ncontinuous reflections. Towards the SE, many of these\nreflections pinch out and appear to downlap shallowly\nas the lavas thin above dipping, divergent sequences.\nThis thinning provides an indication of the maximum\nextent of the lava sequence 1 distal to the Faroe Islands.\nThe character of the sequence suggests that the lavas\npinch out close to the east end of GFA-99. This notion\nis supported by the observations of Ellis et al. (2002).\nFigure 4. Flood basalt rock properties.

Using the interval velocity of 4000 m s\u22121\nit is then possible to calculate the thickness of these\nsequences and their variations across GFA-99 (Fig. 7).\nThe formation is at its thickest (about 1900 m) in the\nnorth and the west, which is more proximal to the\nsource region for the volcanic sequences, however,\nabout 1400 m is calculated to be present where the\ninterpretation of the GFA-99 data is reliable and\n358 D.

Isopach maps of the calculated thicknesses of the\nvolcanic horizons of the Faroe\u2013Shetland succession in the GFA-\n99 data in metres.\nmultiples are at a minimum. As stated, the preserved\nonshore thickness of the Enni Formation is about\n900 m, with the top of the formation missing due to\nerosion. If the lava sequence 1 units were equivalent to\nthe onshore units it would suggest that up to about\n500 m of lavas may be missing from the onshore\nexposures on the Faroe Islands. This is in close\nagreement with previous estimates of erosion of the\nonshore sequence of a few hundred metres (e.g. Ellis\net al. 2002).\n3.a.2. Facies interpretation\nThe seismic reflections in theNWand upper parts of the\nlava sequence 1 interpretation have strong amplitudes\nand are laterally persistent. Individual high amplitude\nreflections may be picked over tens of kilometres\n(Fig. 8a). This simple character and the lateral extent\nof the reflections suggest that the volcanic rocks in\nthese parts of the lava sequence 1 may be of tabular-\ntype facies (e.g. Jerram, 2002). From onshore studies,\nthe Enni Formation volcanic rocks have been shown to\nbe composed of simple type flows of about 10 m mean\nthickness (Ellis et al. 2002), intercalated with zones\nof thin compound flows (Passey & Bell, 2007) (e.g.\nFig. 8b). Between many of the flows, sedimentary in-\ntervals are developed similar in character and thickness\nto those seen in the Skye Lava Field successions on the\nIsle of Skye. The lava sequence 1 rocks are dominated\nby plagioclase\u2013phyric flows in the central Faroes (e.g.\nEllis et al. 2002 and references therein), and have\nbeen interpreted to represent volcanism similar to the\nplains volcanism (Snake River Plain) of Greeley (1982)\n360 D. A. JERRAM AND OTHERS\nFigure 8. An onshore analogue from the Faroe Islands for\nthe transition from lava sequence 1 tabular flows to the lava\nsequence 2 compound-braided flows. The tabular lavas form\nlaterally extensive thick flows (\u223c 10 m thick average) that may\nbe correlated over hundreds of metres to several kilometres.\n(a) A section of GFA-99 line 207 showing the characteristics\nof this architectural facies transition. (b) Cliff section looking\nNE down Kollafj\u00f8r\u203aur on the east coast of Streymoy at about\n300 m thickness of Enni Formation tabular-type lava flows\n(intercalated with poorly exposed compound units). Six obvious\ntubular lava flow basal contacts have been indicated on this\nparticular mountainside section. Note the poor exposure of the\nMalinstindur Formation in comparison.\n(Passey & Bell, 2007). Studies on other sequences\nin the NAIP such as Skye have shown that more\nevolved lava types such as the hawaiites and mugearites\n(basaltic\u2013andesites) which are often found in the upper\nparts of NAIP lava sequences, tend to develop more\nsimplistic internal and external morphologies due to\ntheir increased erupted viscosities and inflated modal\nsilica contents (Single & Jerram, 2004). Given the very\nclear reflectors, much of the lava sequence 1 may be\nconsidered to be akin to these typical trap-like tabular\nlava sequences. The south and eastern areas of GFA-\n99 show the tabular lava sequences are linked with a\nprograding sequence of reflections interpreted to be\nhyaloclastites. We will discuss the detail of this facies\nin the hyaloclastite apron section below.\n3.b. Lava sequence 2\nThe interpretation in this part of the Faroe Islands\nBasalt Group is more difficult than the lava sequence 1\ndue to a loss in seismic resolution. This is caused by the\ngreater depth of the lava sequence 2, the dispersive and\nhigh acoustic impedance properties of the overlying\nlava sequence 1 volcanic rocks, and also the different\ninternal facies architecture of the lava sequence 2,\nprobably due to more compound-braided flow units\nsuch as those noted for the Malinstindur Formation in\nthe onshore exposures on the Faroe Islands.\n3.b.1. Horizon interpretation and distribution\nWhereas the top of the lava sequence 1 is a distinct,\nhigh amplitude reflection beneath the lower sediments\n(due to the high acoustic impedance contrast over the\nsediment\/lava interface), the intra-volcanic contrasts\nare minor, unless seismically significant facies changes\noccur within the succession. In much of the lava\nsequence 1\/lava sequence 2 interface offshore, there is\nno obvious seismic boundary, and arbitrary boundaries\nare inferred. The two formations are usually referred\nto together in most of the literature due to the arbitrary\nnature of the boundary interpreted in seismic studies.\nIn this interpretation, the top of the lava sequence 2\nis taken as the highest amplitude TWT pick which\nsits approximately 600\u20131000 ms beneath the top lava\nsequence 1 pick, which is thought to represent the\nlowest continuous simple flow reflection before a thick\nsequence of predominantly compound flows of the lava\nsequence 2. It should be noted that if the boundary\nbetween lava sequence 1 and lava sequence 2 was the\nsame as that between the Malinstindur Formation and\nthe Enni Formation, onshore, then this horizon would\nbe separated by a thin sequence of volcanic sandstones\nand breccias as in the Sneis Formation (Passey & Bell,\n2007). Given the lack of a clear reflection, if such a\ntransition existed offshore, then the interval must be\ntoo thin and\/or not of significant velocity contrast to be\nimaged.\nIn the SE of the GFA-99 area, the base of the\nlava sequence 2 is interpreted to be the series of\nhigh amplitude broken reflections deep in the volcanic\nsuccession. These are interpreted to be sill complexes\nat the base of the volcanic succession and form zones of\nover 1000 ms TWT of strong, lozenge-like reflections.\nThe convergence of downlapping reflections is also\ntaken as a base-succession marker in this part of the\ndata. The lava sequence 2 is present across the entire\nGFA-99 area, but thins to a minimum in the eastern\nextremity of the dataset, as in the case of the lava\nsequence 1, which could be due to the distance from\nthe eruptive source for these units.\n3.b.2. Thickness\nThickness of the lava sequence 2 varies considerably\nthrough the 2D seismic grid studied. The maximum\nthickness of the formation is about 1900 m (\u223c 950 ms)\nand the lavas pinch out entirely to the southeast. Errors\nassociated with these values may be mainly attributed\nto the difficulties of interpretation of the lava sequence\nOffshore flood basalt sequences 361\n2 base, and to a lesser extent the lava sequence 2 top,\nas discussed above. The thickest part of the volcanic\nrocks lies through the centre of the dataset where a\nN\u2013S swath of volcanic rocks has a mean thickness of\nabout 1300 m (corresponding TWT maps are shown in\nFig. 6b).\n3.b.3. Facies interpretation\nMuch of thewestern part of the dataset contains broken,\ndispersed reflections that cannot be correlated over the\nlarge distances (kilometres) possible in the tabular-type\nlavas interpreted to be present in the lava sequence 1.\nThis is attributed to the lavas being formed of mainly\ncompounded lava flow sequences similar to other\nexamples in the NAIP, such as onshore Faroes (e.g.\nPassey & Bell, 2007) and those seen towards the base\nof the succession studied in the Skye Talisker Bay study\narea (Single & Jerram, 2004). The stacking patterns\nare complex in the vertical section, but also laterally\nas the eruptive style of these flows form compound-\nbraided systems in 3D (Jerram, 2002). Both the lava\nsequence 2 and lava sequence 1 change laterally into\nlarge prograding reflections of the hyaloclastite apron\ndiscussed below.\n3.c. Hyaloclastite apron (lava sequences 1 and 2)\nIn the south and east of the GFA-99 area, beyond N\u2013S\nline 201, the tabular-type lavas of the western parts of\nthe lava sequence 1 are noted to spill into a series of\nbasinward-dipping reflections (e.g. Fig. 5a, b). These\nare interpreted to form a prograding hyaloclastite fan or\napron in the Corona Basin region and dip down towards\nthe ESE. Such prograding hyaloclastites that formed\nfrom lava flows into the sea were originally described\nby Moore et al. (1973) and have been previously\ndescribed in the Faroe\u2013Shetland region (e.g. Kjorboe,\n1999). Good examples are also known from onshore\nGreenland in the NAIP (e.g. Pedersen et al. 1998). The\nreflection sequences in this part of the lava sequence 1\nare clearest on the lines 105 and 107. Although\nthe divergent nature of the reflections is clear, the\nboundaries of any particular sequence are less clearly\ndefined. The hyaloclastites show complex internal\nmorphology in comparison to the more simple lava\ntypes interpreted in the bulk of the lava sequence 1. The\ncomplexity of the internal morphologies of the lavas\nmeans that the distinction between the lava sequence 1\nand the underlying lava sequence 2 is difficult to\ninterpret, especially through the hyaloclastite zones.\nThe interpretation of the presence of a lava sequence 1\nhyaloclastite apron has been made by detailed picking\nof the volcanic internal reflections, paying particular\nattention to onlap, downlaps and pinch-out relation-\nships seen within the formations. The presence of a\nhyaloclastite apron in the lava sequence 1 indicates that\nthe Faroe Islands Basalt Group was filling a water-filled\nbasin in the east of the GFA-99 area, lavas moving into\nthis accommodation space from their eruptive source\nFigure 9. Hyaloclastite facies. (a) The east section of GFA-99\nline 109 where thick hyaloclastites are developed prograding\ntowards the east of the section. (b) Onshore analogue hyalo-\nclastite breccia deposited in the Naajat lake, west Greenland\n(from Pedersen et al. 1998).\nsomewhere in the west. A more distinct boundary\nbetween the lava sequence 1 and the lava sequence\n2 is observed in the north and west of the data area,\nwhere the interpreted hyaloclastites are not deemed to\nbe present. Figure 5a displays a basic interpretation\nof the GFA-99 line 105, showing some of the more\nprominent tabular-type picks in the data, and also some\nof the downlapping features present in the hyaloclastite\ndeltaic succession.\nHyaloclastites are also interpreted to form a large\nthickness of the lava sequence 2. The dipping reflec-\ntions are observed to dip steeply towards the ESE\nand form a body which runs NNE\u2013SSW through the\nstudy area. The spacing of the seismic lines is too\ngreat (20 km) to understand whether the hyaloclastites\nform individual deltas, but their widespread occurrence\nin the lava sequence 2 in lines 105, 107, 109 and\n201 suggest the body to be more like an apron than\nindividual deltas. The thickness of the hyaloclastites\nin the lava sequence 2 indicates the presence of a\ndeep water body proximal to the subaerially erupted\nlavas; the hyaloclastites prograde basinward towards\nthe Corona area and appear to be on a similar scale\nto hyaloclastite dipping successions in west Greenland\n(Fig. 9). Significantly, this accommodation space was\npresent and being filled by both the lava sequence 2\nand lava sequence 1, and provides important additional\nconstraints on models used to look at the spatial and\naerial extent of uplift prior to the onset of volcanism\n(e.g. Jones et al. 2002; Maclennan & Jones, 2006).\nFigure 7 shows a thickness map for the interpreted\nhyaloclastite volcanic rocks that are considered to\n362 D. A. JERRAM AND OTHERS\nbe present in both the lava sequence 2 and the lava\nsequence 1. This body has a maximum thickness of\nabout 1200 m (\u223c 700 m s\u22121), with most data points\nin the body clustering around the 400\u2013600 m thick\nrange (Fig. 7). This represents a massive thickness of\nfragmental volcaniclastic matrial that are interpreted\nto have been erupting into a substantial water body.\nThe calculations of Ellis et al. (2002) suggest the\nhyaloclastites form foresets between 150 and 500 m\nin thickness. The present study confirms a similar\ncalculated-scale of hyaloclastite foresets.\n3.d. Lava sequence 3\nThe depth at which the top lava sequence 3 volcanic\nrocks exist in the seismic data is difficult to interpret,\nbecause deeper structure ismasked due to earth filtering\nof the seismic signal by the complex overburden\nsuccession. Its presence and structure is therefore\nratified by the use of gravity data. An interpretation is\nnow presented based on a combination of the seismic\nreflection characteristics and gravity models. Gravity\nmodels were built at ARK Geophysics Ltd prior to\nboth the collection of Faroe Islands fieldwork data and\nbefore the seismic interpretations were finalized.\n3.d.1. Horizon interpretation and distribution\nIt is not possible to interpret accurately the boundaries\nof the succession, or if the lava sequence 3 exists at all\nin more than just the three W\u2013E lines of 105, 107 and\n109. The lava sequence 3 must be also present in N\u2013S\nline 207, but its interpretation is difficult to justify to\nthe east of this particular line. The easterly extent of the\nformation is interpreted to be coincident with the East\nFaroe High. Base lava sequence 3 picks are represented\nin Figure 5, by a pick based on the interpretation of sills\nat the base of the succession as strong, bright seismic\nreflections, and the downlap of dipping reflections.\n3.d.2. Thickness\nThe Lopra-1\/1A borehole indicates the succession to\nbe extremely thick beneath the Faroe Islands. The\ninterpretation of the seismic data predicts a thickness\nof at least 3000 m (\u223c 1630 ms) (Fig. 6). The most\nreasonable estimate of lava sequence 3 thickness is\nmade by combining the seismic interpretation with\ngravity data into a model. Along the profile of line 107\nthis modelling required a base-case model thickness\nin excess of 2700 m (Fig. 10). This is consistent with\nthe observation from seismic studies and highlights the\nneed for a multi-disciplinary approach to help solve\nbasalt cover and sub-basalt imaging problems (Jegen-\nKulcsar & Hobbs, 2005; Hautot et al. 2007).\n3.d.3. Gravity based interpretation\nThe facies interpretation is based on observations\nof the geometries present within the possible lava\nsequence 3 succession, and by creating gravity models\nalong the seismic W\u2013E lines. An initial interpretation\nof line 107 is shown in Figure 10a. This gravity\nmodel is constructed over depth-converted seismic\ndata and horizon interpretations (depth converted at\nARK Geophysics), and it includes the hyaloclastite\npiles of the lava sequence 2, but the lava sequence 3\nis missing entirely, and there is no sub-volcanic\nsedimentary succession. The densities assigned within\nparticular stratigraphic packages are implemented from\nthe ARK Field software database in combination with\na volcanic rock property database developed as part\nof the SIMBA project (e.g. Fig. 4b; see Nelson et al.\n2009). This provides an unsatisfactory interpretation of\nthe regional gravity data.\nAn improved gravity model of line 107 is shown\nin Figure 10b. The reduction in density of the central\nportion has improved the calculated gravity response\nby adding sediment to the sub-volcanic part of the\nsuccession. This will be discussed in the next section.\nIf we assume that the sediments do not extend to the\nwestern edge of the model, we need some additional\nmass loss to fit the observed gravity anomaly. In par-\nticular, line 107 shows dipping reflections that can be\ninterpreted as part of a lava sequence 3 succession. This\nsuggests that the lava sequence 3 may be represented\nby hyaloclastites and volcaniclastics similar to those\nseen more distal and basinward in the lava sequence 2\nand lava sequence 1. By reducing the density of the\ninterpretation of the lava sequence 3 in this model of\nline 107 to that of a hyaloclastite, a good fit between\nthe observed and calculated gravity is achieved. The\nlava sequence 3 is known to form thick tabular-\ntype lavas in the Lopra-1\/1A section, but beneath\nthese, the drilling was terminated in a thick pile of\nsubaqueously deposited volcaniclastics\/hyaloclastites\n(Ellis et al. 2002; Waagstein, 2006). In the area of GFA-\n99, these are considered to be represented by the basinal\nprogradational lava delta hyaloclastites suggested by\ngravity interpretation.\n3.e. The sub-volcanic section\nThe sub-volcanic zone is the part of the dataset which\nhas interested the petroleum industry enough to acquire\nseismic datasets such as GFA-99. The sub-volcanic\nsection is considered to be a potential petroleum play\n(e.g. Ziska & Andersen, 2005). The top part of the sub-\nvolcanic rocks is marked by interpreted sill complexes.\n3.e.1. Sills\nSill complexes are observed at the base of the lava\nsequences of Skye, in great thicknesses on the northern\nTrotternish Peninsula in particular, where over 50 m\nof sills sit beneath the base of the lava succession.\nOffshore flood basalt sequences 363\nFigure 10. (a) Gravity model of GFA-99 line 107 (see Fig. 1 for location) built from seismic interpretation picks only. The above\nmodel is inaccurate in several areas, particularly in the centre of the line where mass-loss is required both within and beneath the\nvolcanic succession. (b) Geological interpretation and model of the GFA-99 line 107 incorporating Bouguer gravity data. The observed\ngravity anomaly along line 107 requires a significant volume of low-density material to be present in the central portion of the line\nat a sub-volcanic level. The observed gravity profile strengthens the argument for a significant succession of LS3 hyaloclastite at the\nwest end of the section where the density of the LS3 geological interpretation needs to be reduced at that level in the stratigraphy. The\ngravity profile interpretation is filtered to 45 km low-pass wavelength; at this wavelength, the gravity calculated from the model has a\nmaximum deviation of 0.7 mgal from the observed Bouguer data.\n364 D. A. JERRAM AND OTHERS\nSimilarly, in the Etendeka flood basalts of Namibia,\nthe substantial Huab Sills complex again fills a large\nvolume of dense material at the base of the province\nlava sequences (Duncan et al. 1989). In the NAIP, sill\ncomplexes have been successfully imaged in some of\nthe 3D seismic data sets (e.g. Thomson, 2005) and\nwhere limited or no significant lava cover exists (e.g.\nHansen, 2006). In the Faroe\u2013Shetland basin, significant\nsill complexes are known from seismic studies on the\nfeather edge of the lavas (e.g. Smallwood & Maresh,\n2002). Therefore, there is significant evidence for\noffshore sill complexes in this region, and in many\nflood basalt examples exposed onshore there is a\ncommon relationship of sills intruding in and around\nthe sediment\/lava contact at the base of the lava pile.\nIn the GFA-99 data, high amplitude reflections fill\nwhat is considered to be the basal zone of the lava\nfield. Although individual reflections are rarely over\n5 km long, they are interpreted to represent a series of\nsills in the Faroe\u2013Shetland Sill Complex (Smallwood\n& Maresh 2002) seated at the base of the succession\nacross most of the GFA data. The sills are at their most\nprominent at the interpreted base of the lava sequence 2\nbeneath the hyaloclastite zones, and landward, beneath\nthe interpreted compound lava types (Fig. 5).\n3.e.2. Sedimentary rocks and basement\nThe presence of sub-volcanic sediments and the shape\nof the basement surface have been interpreted by the\nuse of gravity data. Figure 10 presents 2D gravity\nmodels of the GFA line 107. These contain the greatest\namount of vertical and lateral facies variability in the\nentire dataset. A simple, normally faulted basement\nis interpreted from Bouguer gravity data filtered to\nremove wavelengths longer than 350 km. On top of\nthe basement a large thickness of sediment is modelled\nfor a gravity data fit ratified to the 45 km high cut filter\nlevel; this filter allows accurate gravity interpretation as\ndeep in the section as the top of the volcanic rocks. The\nsediment maximum thickness on top of this basement\nis estimated to be 6000 m. This is consistent with the\ntotal apparent sediment thickness estimated by Kimbell\net al. (2005) in this area, predicting localized depo-\ncentres with up to 10 km of sedimentary succession\nover basement.\n4. Summary\nThe key volcanic facies that develop and their internal\narchitectures are presented in Figure 11. In the present\nstudy we have introduced the facies variations that\noccur through the observed lava sequences on the\nFaroe Islands and presented a simplistic geological\ninterpretation of the offshore lava sequences that are\nimaged in the GFA-99 dataset with the following\nobservations and conclusions:\n(1) Common lava facies that are found in the NAIP\nand particularly in the Faroe Islands succession include\npackages of Tabular Simple flows (individual flows\nFigure 11. (a) The development of a hyaloclastite apron pile\nas the lavas prograde into a substantial water body in the distal\nparts of the lava sequence 1\/lava sequence 2 and potentially in\nthe LLS, as interpreted from seismic, Bouguer gravitymodelling\nand from Lopra 1\/1A borehole interpretations. (b) Development\nof the lava field in the Faroe Islands Basalt Group lava sequence 1\nand lava sequence 2.\n\u223c 20 m thick, Compound-Braided facies of lava lobes\nand flows (component flow lobes < 5 m thick) (e.g.\nPassey & Bell, 2007), and subaqueously deposited\nHyaloclastite facies (e.g. Fig. 11).\n(2) The succession of volcanic rocks in the GFA-99\noffshore data area potentially has a maximum thickness\nin excess of 6800 m, which is calculated in this study.\nThis fits within the estimated ranges of preserved\nthickness of 6500\u20137000 m on the Faroes (Ellis et al.\n2002; Passey & Bell, 2007). Generally down to the top\nof the sub-volcanic sediments, or top lava sequence 3,\nwhere present, the succession has a thickness of about\n2700 m across much of the area, again similar to\nestimates of up to \u223c 3000 m (Fliedner & White, 2003).\nA further 2700 m or more of lava sequence 3 may\nexist beneath this lava sequence 1\u2013lava sequence 2 total\nthickness, as estimated from the combined gravity and\nseismic modelling to the north and west of the region.\nThese thicknesses compare well with the estimates of\nEllis et al. (2002), who suggest the complete thickness\nof the extensive volcanic units discussed to be about\nOffshore flood basalt sequences 365\n5550 m, combining data from the Faroe Islands and\noffshore data.\n(3) The extrusive activity began with the emplace-\nment of volcaniclastic material into a substantial water-\nbody which lay in the environs of the present-day Faroe\nIslands. Their presence may be interpreted offshore\nto the SE of the islands. During the lava sequence 3,\nthe volcanic rocks filled this former water-filled basin\nand erupted into the sub-aerial environment. Thick\ntabular-type lavas (flows \u223c 20 m thick) formed a lava\nsuccession more than 900 m thick in the Faroes area\nand this eruptive phase waned. This process is likely\nto have taken place from c. 57 to 55 Ma (see Jolley,\n2009).\n(4) At c. 55 Ma, early in Chron24r, the lava\nsequence 2 blanketed the Faroe platformwith thin flows\nof dominantly compound-braided facies architecture.\nThese are similar in facies character to those seen in the\nMalinstindur Formation on the Faroes, and examples\ntowards the base of the Skye Lava Field (Single &\nJerram, 2004). In the east of the offshore study area,\nthese formed water-borne prograding hyaloclastite\nfans that grew into a slope-apron of foreset-bedded\nvolcaniclastic material architecturally similar to the\nvolcanic rocks seen in West Greenland (Pedersen\net al. 1998) (Fig. 10). The convergence of the foreset-\nbeds marks the base of the volcanic succession in the\noffshore data.\n(5) The seismic response offshore suggests that the\nlava sequence 1 is dominated by laterally extensive\nsimple flows and that the lava sequence 2 has a more\ncomplex internal architecture akin to compound units.\n(6) The Hyaloclastite Apron indicates the presence\nof a significant body of water into which the lavas of the\nlava sequence 2 and lava sequence 1 prograded. This\nbody, more than 500 m deep, must have been present at\nthe onset of volcanism at c. 55 Ma, and may have been\npresent but unfilled during the earlier volcanism.\nAcknowledgements.
