Agricultural lime \nis used in farming as a soil conditioner to prevent acidification, provide a source of plant \nnutrients (calcium and magnesium) and improve the physical properties of the soil. In the UK \nit is produced in modern processing plants alongside aggregate and other products such as \nmineral fillers. The project \u2018FarmLime: Low-cost lime for small-scale farming\u2019 was funded by \nthe UK Government Department for International Development (DfID). The aim of DfID \nresearch is to \u201calleviate poverty\u201d through improved access to knowledge and technology, \nspecifically by \u201cenhancing the productive capacity (of less-developed countries) in an \nenvironmentally sensitive manner\u201d. The findings of a previous DfID research project \u2018Local \ndevelopment of affordable lime in southern Africa\u2019 concluded that agricultural lime could be \nproduced on a small-scale from local dolomite within farming districts. The aim of the \nFarmLime project was to test these conclusions in the farming districts of Northern Zambia, \nwhich are broadly representative of farming in southern Africa.\nAgricultural lime production & consumption in Zambia\nAgricultural lime is available from five companies in Zambia, located in the main \u2018economic \ncorridor\u2019 extending from Lusaka in the south to the Copperbelt in the north. Lilyvale Farm (Kabwe, \nCentral Province) is a coffee plantation that also produces agricultural lime and represents the old \nstyle of operation, which was developed to serve the needs of the large agricultural estates. \nMinedeco Small Mines in Lusaka, is a former parastatal company that produces mineral fillers for \nlocal industry as well as a small volume of agricultural lime. Ndola Lime Ltd (Ndola, Copperbelt \nProvince) is a large quick lime and hydrated lime plant that produces agricultural lime as a by-\nproduct \u2018dust\u2019 from the crushing plant. These operations represent the old nationalized industry \nestablished in the 1960s. However they now have to exist without state subsidies alongside more \ncompetitive rivals and as a result all are struggling. Uniturtle Industries (Z) Ltd in Lusaka, is a \ncompany that mainly produces decorative stone and has in the last few years expanded into \nproduction of mineral fillers, agricultural lime and stock feed. Hi-Qwalime Mining Ltd (Mkushi, \nFarmLime 2\nCentral Province) is an operation dedicated to producing agricultural lime. These operations have \nbeen encouraged since denationalization of the state mining sector and have been funded by \nprivate investment with strong South African connections.\nThe current consumption of agricultural lime in Zambia is about 40,000 tonnes per year mostly by \nlarge-scale commercial farmers. This is a relatively low volume as the latent demand for \nagricultural lime is thought to be about 150,000 tonnes per year (Shitumbanuma & Simukanga, \n1995). To achieve this level of consumption would require a dramatic increase in the use of \nagricultural lime, especially by small-scale farmers; however they do not have a tradition of using \nthis agricultural input.\nSocio-economic survey\nSmall-scale farmers who use agricultural lime can improve their crop yields, produce more food \nfor their families and (potentially) generate some income. Surveys carried out by questionnaire \nreturns & interviewing of small-scale farmers representative of farming districts in Zambia \n(Mitchell et al 1997; 2003) found that they do not use lime for the following reasons:\n\u2022 Farmers are either unaware or unconvinced of the need for agricultural lime. Farmers receive \nlittle advice on the use of agricultural lime from agricultural extension workers (field workers \nproviding advice and assistance to farmers), there is a lack of information regarding its quality \nand use, and poor packaging and labeling.\n\u2022 The Ministry of Agriculture, Food & Fisheries and the University of Zambia both carry out soil \ntesting for farmers. However, little soil sampling and testing is carried out for small-scale \nfarmers because it is expensive and time consuming. Farmers do not know their soil pH and \nthe amount of lime to apply.\nFarmLime 3\n\u2022 Agricultural lime is expensive and often the farmers do not have the cash to buy it. An \nalternative form of payment, such as bartering, could partly replace cash payment. Most of \nthe producers are reluctant to supply the small volumes (50kg) required by small-scale \nfarmers as they prefer to supply in large volumes to commercial farmers. Also, transportation \nis expensive, typically adding US$1 per tonne per 10km traveled.\nGovernment and NGO (Non-Governmental Organisation) food security programmes have \nattempted to stimulate the demand for agricultural lime by small-scale farmers without much \nsuccess (Mengo 2002). However, this is probably the key to future development of small-scale \nfarming in southern Africa.\nCarbonate resource assessment\nMost of the provinces in Zambia have carbonate resources (limestone and dolomite). However \nnot all are suitable for the production of agricultural lime. The key parameters used to determine \nthe suitability of these rocks as a source of agricultural lime are as follows:\n\u2022 Neutralisation ability  , expressed as the weight percentage Calcium Carbonate Equivalent \n(CCE) and often referred to as the Neutralisation Value (NV). This is the amount of calcite \nand\/ or equivalent dolomite and is the key property in reducing soil acidity. A CCE value of \n80% is considered to be a minimum for agricultural lime.\n\u2022 Plant nutrient content  , expressed as the weight percentage calcium oxide (CaO) and \nmagnesium oxide (MgO). An MgO content of 6% is considered to be a minimum for \nagricultural lime (Tether & Money 1989).\nFarmLime 4\n\u2022 Ease of pulverization  , otherwise known as the Grindability Index, is the weight percentage of \nfine particles generated in a milling trial. This indicates the hardness of the carbonate and, \nindirectly, the amount of energy required to produce agricultural lime of the required fineness.\n\u2022 Agronomic effectiveness  , otherwise known as the reactivity, is a measure of the rate at which \nagricultural lime neutralises soil acidity.\nDolomite is preferred for the production of agricultural lime as it contains both of the important \nplant nutrients (calcium and magnesium) and has a high neutralising ability (ARC Southern \n1996). Dolomite samples from across Zambia were evaluated and many were found to have \ncomparable technical properties with commercially available agricultural lime (Table 1).\nLime production research\nResearch was carried out to determine if agricultural lime could be produced on a small-scale, \nusing appropriate technology and manual labour where appropriate. Commercial operations \nquarry, crush and grind carbonate rock to produce agricultural lime; typically with a particle-size \ndistribution of 100% finer than 2mm, 60% finer than 400\u00b5m and up to 50% finer than 150\u00b5m.\nSmall-scale production of agricultural lime would require quarrying of carbonate rock involving \nmanual bush clearing and loose soil removal, drilling and blasting, and manual loading and \nhauling of the extracted rock; with an estimated cost of US$1.45 per tonne of rock extracted (see \nTable 2). Field trials were carried out to produce agricultural lime. Crushing of the dolomite to an \nappropriate size (10mm) for the milling stage was carried out manually using sledgehammers. \nThis was found to be an expensive process as it was slow and labour intensive, costing up to \nUS$10 per tonne. As an alternative, a manually operated jaw crusher could be used to speed up \nthe crushing process; it is estimated that this could reduce the cost of the crushing to less than \nUS$1 per tonne. The milling trials were based on the TD Hammer Mill (originally designed for \nFarmLime 5\nmaize milling) which was modified for milling of dolomite. The mill is powered by a single-piston \npetrol engine, which is used to drive the mill hammers directly via the engine shaft. The rock is \nfed into the milling chamber via a launder and the ground material falls through a product sieve. \nThe milling cost was estimated to be approximately US$20 per tonne of (bagged) agricultural lime \nproduced.\nThe estimated costs of producing agricultural lime using a small-scale operation are summarised \nin Table 2; these were based on Zambian labour and equipment costs The overall cost is about \nUS$32 per tonne; use of a manual jaw crusher could reduce the production costs down to US$25 \nper tonne.\nDiversification & spontaneous uptake\nThe Zambian Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), produced by the Zambian Ministry of \nFinance and Economic Development (MOFED), focuses on measures to achieve strong \nsustained economic growth (5-8% pa) with enhanced agricultural productivity given the highest \npriority. Another key goal of the PRSP is diversification of the small-scale mining sector, currently \ndominated by gemstone mining, into industrial minerals. Industrial minerals form an integral part \nof the sustainable development of an economy as they are driven by genuine industrial needs \nand are more likely to be the basis of long-term economic activity. This compares with gemstone \nmining which often has problems associated with migrant labour and \u2018boom town\u2019 scenarios, \ncross border smuggling and illegal mining.\nDiversification of an existing mineral producer, FRECA Mining & Manufacturing Ltd in Solwezi, \nhas occurred through \u2018spontaneous uptake\u2019 of the agricultural lime production methods advocated \nby the FarmLime project following field trials of the modified TD Hammer Mill. FRECA employ \nsmall-scale miners to produce construction aggregate using traditional mining and crushing \nmethods. Fires are set on the dolomite outcrops which when hot are doused with water to \nFarmLime 6\npromote cracking. The dolomite is then removed using picks and crowbars. The rock is crushed \nby hand using hammers and sieved to remove the dust, which is sold as agricultural lime (in 50kg \nbags) to local farmers. FRECA have fabricated a hammer mill, which they will use to produce \nagricultural lime from the crushed dolomite.\nCrop trials\nDemonstration crop trials were carried out to show farmers the benefits of using agricultural lime. \nThe sites chosen for the demonstration trials were located in Mkushi district which has acid soils \nand a source of dolomite suitable for agricultural lime production The agricultural lime used was \nthat produced using the modified TD Hammer Mill. The amount required for the demonstration \nsites was based on the exchangeable aluminium content of the soil and the neutralising ability of \nthe agricultural lime to be used. This was determined to be between 200 and 450kg per hectare. \nEach site was divided into ten plots - five for maize and five for groundnuts - including one with no \nlime, two with lime and two with double the amount of lime. The lime was added as either a \u2018spot \napplication\u2019 (i.e. applied to the immediate vicinity of the plant only) or \u2018broadcast application\u2019 (i.e. \nspread over the entire plot).\nThe crops were planted according to the Zambian MAFF (Ministry of Agriculture, Food & \nFisheries) recommendations for small-scale farmers. The farmer, his family and neighbours, \ntended the plots, which were revisited to monitor the progress the following year. The crops were \nharvested and data on grain weight are given in Table 3. The maize and groundnuts from the \nlimed plots generally gave higher yields than the unlimed plots. During the agricultural lime \ndemonstration farmers neighbouring the trial sites started to use agricultural lime; understanding \nthis aspect of the crop trials will be important for future promotion of agricultural lime.\nFarmLime 7\nCost Benefit Analysis\nThe benefits of using agricultural lime will largely depend on the economic factors, such as the \ncost of the lime and the increase in crop yields to the small-scale farmer. A cost benefit analysis \nwas carried out to quantify the economic benefits for small-scale farmers in using agricultural \nlime. Farmers will directly benefit if the value of the additional crops produced exceeds the cost of \nthe agricultural lime used. This can be quantified as a Value Cost Ratio (VCR) as follows:\nVCR =     (Weight of additional crop produced) X (Unit value of the crop)\n(Cost of using agricultural lime)\nThe UN Food & Agriculture Organisation (FAO) believes that for small scale farmers a VCR \nabove 2 is required for uptake of new inputs (i.e. the value of the additional crops produced is at \nleast double the cost of using agricultural lime). Value cost ratios were determined for several \nscenarios based on varying maize yields, maize price and input costs (Table 4). It is estimated \nthat small-scale farmers should be able to increase their maize yields from their current average \nof about 1.5 tonnes per hectare per tonne of lime as follows:\n\u2022 Extremely acid soil (pH <4.5) Increase maize yield by 5 tonnes per hectare\n\u2022 Very acid soils (pH <5): Increase maize yield by 3 tonnes per hectare\n\u2022 Acid soils (pH 5-6): Increase maize yield by 1.5 tonnes per hectare\nThe value of maize produced can vary greatly, from US$200 per tonne (realised by commercial \nfarmers close to maize mills and selling at the optimum time) to less than US$50 per tonne \n(realised by small-scale farmers in remote locations selling as the need arises). The cost of \nagricultural lime is typically US$20 ex-works (i.e. collected from the producer) and a further US$1 \nis added per tonne for every 10 kilometres the lime has to be transported (this can multiply the \nFarmLime 8\ncost several fold for remote farmers). Two maize values (US$50 and US$110 per tonne) and two \nagricultural lime costs (US$30 and US$60 per tonne) were used in the calculations\nThe use of agricultural lime was found to be economically beneficial in most cases. The results \nshow that farmers who live close to the source of their inputs, farm highly acid soils and can \nrealise a high price for their maize will see the greatest improvements in their incomes. \nConclusions\nAgricultural lime is a widely used commodity in the developed world. However, in less developed \ncountries such as many in southern Africa this is not the case. Small-scale farmers are unaware \nor unconvinced of the need for agricultural lime and hence their use of lime is minimal. \nDemonstrating the benefits of using lime is an important way to persuade farmers to use lime. \nOnce persuaded, they need a simple and cheap soil test to determine agricultural lime demand. \nAgricultural lime should be made available to all small-scale farmers; for those who cannot afford \nto buy lime an alternative form of payment should be allowed, such as bartering.\nThere are ample resources of dolomite rock available throughout Zambia for agricultural lime \nproduction. The Neutralising Value (NV) and the plant nutrient content are the most important \nproperties to determine in an evaluation of their suitability for use as agricultural lime. Small-scale \nproduction of agricultural lime would require quarrying (involving drilling and blasting), manual \ncrushing and milling. The modified TD Hammer mill is capable of producing 1-2 tonnes of \nagricultural lime per day. The production cost was found to be relatively high (US$32 per tonne); \nthis cost could be reduced if a cheaper crushing method were employed.\nEnhanced agricultural productivity and diversification of the small-scale mining sector are two key \nobjectives of the Zambian Poverty Reduction Strategy. Spontaneous uptake of the agricultural \nlime production method by an existing small-scale operator in Solwezi met these objectives.\nFarmLime 9\nDemonstration plots (maize and groundnuts) were established in an attempt to convince small-\nscale farmers of the benefits of using agricultural lime. The highly acidic soil of the trial plots \nrequired lime addition of up to 500kg per hectare. The maize yield increased nearly threefold to \n6.7 tonnes per hectare and the groundnut yield increased nearly seven fold to 320kg per hectare.\nIn most cases the use of agricultural lime by small-scale farmers will have economic benefits. \nHowever its use will depend on the small-scale farmer having the cash to purchase it and any \nsignificant increase in its use will probably require Government intervention. The key to uptake is \ndemonstration of the benefits of using agricultural lime.
