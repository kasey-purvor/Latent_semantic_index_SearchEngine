Yumoto4\nReceived 7 September 2004; revised 22 October 2004; accepted 17 November 2004; published 28 January 2005.\n[1] Pi2 pulsations during the intervals of extremely quiet geomagnetic conditions\n(Kp = 0) have been reported by Sutcliffe and Lyons [2002]. These authors observed that\nseveral Pi2 bursts occurred simultaneously at high (magnetic latitude = 71\u0001) and low\n(42\u0001) latitudes during the absence of magnetospheric substorms and found that the bursts\nare strongly correlated with poleward boundary intensifications (PBIs). The authors\ndiscussed the correlation between the PBI-associated Pi2 (PBI-Pi2) bursts and\nenhancements of energetic particle fluxes in the plasma sheet, but they did not focus on\nthe wave properties of the PBI-Pi2 pulsations. In this study we examine whether the\nPBI-Pi2 pulsations at middle\/low latitudes exhibit spatial variations similar to substorm-\nassociated Pi2 pulsations. Using ground-based data from latitudinally and longitudinally\nextended magnetometer network and spacecraft data in the duskside, we investigate\nthe spatial variation of the frequency, amplitude, phase, and interstation coherence of the\nPBI-Pi2 events. We show that the PBI-Pi2 pulsations in this study have different features\nat different local times and suggest that their period and duration are determined at a\nsource region, where fast earthward flows brake.\nCitation: Kim, K.-H., K.

Res., 110, A01217, doi:10.1029\/2004JA010780.\n1. Introduction\n[2] Pi2 magnetic pulsations have been commonly\nobserved at the onset of a magnetospheric substorm. They\nare damped and transient geomagnetic oscillations with\nperiods of 40\u2013150 s [e.g., Saito, 1969]. Magnetic pulsations\nin the Pi2 band occur at all latitudes on the nightside and\nexhibit latitudinal and longitudinal variations in amplitude\nand phase [Yumoto, 1986].\n[3] The amplitude of Pi2 pulsations maximizes at high\nlatitudes. High-latitude Pi2 pulsations are mainly observed\nin the region of substorm-enhanced ionospheric electrojet\n[e.g., Olson and Rostoker, 1975]. The evolution of these\npulsations is tied to the evolution of the substorm current\nsystem. Midlatitude\/low-latitude Pi2 pulsations have differ-\nent spectral contents from those at high latitude, suggesting\ndifferent source mechanism for different latitudes [Yumoto\net al., 1994]. The excitation mechanisms of the midlatitude\/\nlow-latitude Pi2 have been considered as shear Alfve\u00b4n\nmode resonances [Fukunishi, 1975], surface waves on the\nplasmapause [Sutcliffe, 1975], and cavity mode resonances\n[Saito and Matsushita, 1968]. Such models for the lower-\nlatitude Pi2 have been well organized by Yeoman and Orr\n[1989] and by Osaki et al. [1998]. Ground-based observa-\ntions [e.g., Stuart, 1974; Yeoman and Orr, 1989; Lin et al.,\n1991] and ground-satellite observations [e.g., Takahashi et\nal., 1995; Takahashi et al., 2001; Kim et al., 2001; Keiling\net al., 2001] showed that the cavity mode in the plasma-\nsphere, which is driven by impulsive source outside the\nplasmapause, is a promising mechanism for low-latitude to\nmidlatitude Pi2 pulsations.\n[4] Recently, it has been proposed that Pi2 is generated\nby compressional pulses produced by high-speed earthward\nflows in the near-tail [Shiokawa et al., 1998; Kepko and\nKivelson, 1999]. That is, Pi2 pulsations in the inner mag-\nnetosphere can be directly driven by oscillatory sources\nexternal to the plasmapause. Osaki et al. [1998] suggested\nthat Pi2 pulsations observed off the magnetic equator in the\nplasmasphere are not a simple cavity mode oscillation\nexcited by an impulsive source. Shiokawa et al. [1998]\nreported that substorm-associated high-speed flow burst\nwas followed by a Pi2 pulsation that is observed both in\nthe inner magnetosphere and on the ground. Kepko and\nKivelson [1999] and Kepko et al. [2001] showed several\nexamples of Pi2 waves and flow oscillations that have\nnearly identical waveforms. The authors suggested that\nflows in the magnetotail determine the properties of the\nlow-latitude Pi2 pulsations.\n[5] Substorms are not the only phenomenon associated\nwith high-speed earthward flows and Pi2 pulsations. Lyons\net al. [1999] studied a type of geomagnetic activity termed\npoleward boundary intensifications (PBIs). PBIs are night-\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 110, A01217, doi:10.1029\/2004JA010780, 2005\n1Department of Astronomy and Space Science, Kyung Hee University,\nKyunggi, Korea.\n2Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, Laurel, Mary-\nland, USA.\n3Hermanus Magnetic Observatory, Hermanus, South Africa.\n4Space Environment Research Center, Kyushu University, Fukuoka,\nJapan.\nCopyright 2005 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/05\/2004JA010780$09.00\nA01217 1 of 15\nside geomagnetic disturbances that have an auroral signa-\nture moving equatorward from the poleward boundary of\nthe auroral zone. PBIs occur under all geomagnetic con-\nditions, both in the presence and absence of substorms.\nLyons et al. [1999] revealed that there were bursty flows in\nthe plasma sheet during the PBIs and that each PBI\naccompanied a Pi2 pulsation. Sutcliffe and Lyons [2002]\nreported PBI-associated Pi2 pulsations, which occurred\nsimultaneously at high (magnetic latitude = 71\u0001) and low\n(42\u0001) latitudes, during the absence of substorms. The\nauthors discussed the relation between PBIs and energetic\nparticle enhancements in the plasma sheet and between\nPBIs and Pi2-burst train. However, the physical properties\nand excitation mechanism of the PBI-associated Pi2 pul-\nsations were not included in their discussion.\n[6] In this study we focus on the PBI-associated Pi2\npulsations reported by Sutcliffe and Lyons [2002]. We\nexamine whether the nonsubstorm Pi2 events exhibit spatial\nvariations similar to substorm-related Pi2 pulsations and\nexamine the characteristics of the PBI-related pulsations,\nusing ground-based data and spacecraft data.\n[7] The organization of the paper is as follows. In section 2\nwe briefly describe the data sets used in this study. In\nsection 3 we describe the data analysis. In section 4 we\ncompare our observations with previous studies and discuss\nthe possible model for explaining the observations. Section 5\npresents the conclusions.\n2. Data Sets\n[8] We use ground-based magnetometer data from the\nInternational Monitor for Auroral Geomagnetic Effects\n(IMAGE) [Lu\u00a8hr et al., 1998], the Sub-Auroral Magnetom-\neter Network (SAMNET) [Yeoman et al., 1990], the\nCircum-pan Pacific Magnetometer Network (CPMN)\n[Yumoto et al., 1996], and Hermanus (HER) station [Sutcliffe\nand Yumoto, 1989]. The geographic and corrected geomag-\nnetic coordinates (CGM) are listed in Table 1 for SAMNET\nand IMAGE stations and Table 2 for HER and CPMN\nstations, respectively. The time resolutions of magnetometer\ndata are 10 s for the IMAGE stations and 5 s for the\nSAMNET stations. The 5-s average data generated from\nthe original 1-s samples are used for the CPMN and HER\ndata.\n[9] We compare the ground magnetic field data with the\nspin-averaged (\u00016 s) electric field [Harvey et al., 1995] and\nmagnetic field [Russell et al., 1995] data acquired at dusk\n(\u00011800\u20131900 MLT) by the Polar spacecraft. The Polar\nmagnetic field data have been rotated into mean field-\naligned coordinates in which e^zMFA is along the averaged\nmagnetic field defined by taking the 5-min boxcar running\naverages of the \u00016-s data, the azimuthal direction e^yMFA is\nparallel to e^zMFA \u0002 r, where r is the spacecraft position\nvector with respect to the center of the Earth, and the radially\noutward component is given by e^xMFA = e^yMFA \u0002 e^zMFA. The\nelectric field data will be presented using the spacecraft\ncoordinates (56, XY, Z). The electric field vector was only\ndetermined from the measurements of two spin-plane\ncomponents (i.e., Exy and Ez). In the spacecraft coordinate\nsystem, e^z lies in the spacecraft spin plane, pointing\napproximately toward the ecliptic north, e^xy lies in the\nspin plane perpendicular to e^z, pointing antisunward, and\ne^56 completes a right-hand system (i.e., e^xy \u0002 e^z = e^56).\nThe radial field oscillations can be identified in the XY\nand\/or Z components with respect to the satellite location\nin the meridian plane. The azimuthal oscillation is in the\nTable 1.

Analysis of PBI-Associated Pi2 Pulsations\n[10] The 4-hour interval (1800\u20132200 UTon 27 December\n1997) selected in this study was previously presented by\nSutcliffe and Lyons [2002, hereinafter referred to as SL02].\nIn that study the authors showed several PBI-associated\nPi2 bursts to occur simultaneously at high (magnetic\nlatitude = 71\u0001) and low (42\u0001) latitudes under an extremely\nquiet geomagnetic condition (Kp = 0+ for 1800\u20132100 UT\nand 0 for 2100\u20132400 UT). The authors focused on the\noccurrence of Pi2 bursts associated with the plasma\nvariations in the plasma sheet, but they did not include\nan examination of the wave characteristics in their study.\nWe examine in detail the PBI-associated Pi2 (hereinafter\nreferred to as PBI-Pi2) pulsations using ground-based\ndata from latitudinally and longitudinally extended mag-\nnetometer network and data from the Polar spacecraft\nlocated on the duskside magnetosphere.\n3.1. Overview of PBI-Pi2 Events\n[11] The provisional auroral electrojet indices AL and\nAU and filtered H-component magnetometer data from\nKvistaberg (KVI) (L \u00013.3, local time \u0001UT +1.2 hours),\nwhich is one of SAMNET ground stations, are plotted in\nFigures 1a and 1b, respectively. In the KVI data we\nidentify six major Pi2 bursts occurring at 1829 UT (event\nA), 1901 UT (event B), 1935 UT (event C), 2006 UT\n(event D), 2041 UT (event E), and 2115 UT (event F).\nThe onsets of the bursts are marked by the vertical dotted\nlines. These are the same as the Pi2 bursts observed at\nthe low-latitude Hermanus (HER, L \u00011.9, local time\n\u0001UT +1.3 hours) station in SL02. During the interval\n1800\u20132200 UT, the magnitudes of AU and jALj are less\nthan 10 nT. Unlike substorm-associated Pi2 pulsations,\nthere are no sudden decreases in AL accompanied by the\nPi2 bursts. Note that the KVI data are filtered 4\u201310 mHz\n(100\u2013250 s), which is the lower limit of the Pi2 frequency\nrange. We will show below that dominant spectral peaks\nof the PBI-Pi2 pulsations are in the frequency range of\n4\u201310 mHz.\n[12] Figure 2 shows the unfiltered magnetic field data\nfrom selected IMAGE stations at magnetic latitude between\n\u000165\u0001 and \u000176\u0001. This plot is the same as Figure 2 in SL02\nbut including the Z component. The vertical dashed lines\nindicate the onsets of the Pi2 bursts at KVI. The ground\nstations are ordered from the highest corrected geomagnetic\nlatitude at the top to the lowest at the bottom. The IMAGE\nstations were in the local magnetic midnight at \u00012100 UT.\nFrom the IMAGE magnetometer data, it is inferred that the\nwestward electrojet was centered at a latitude between\nHopen Island (HOP) and Bear Island (BJN) based on the\nlatitude at which the perturbation in the X component is a\nmaximum and the Z component changes sign. The ampli-\nFigure 1. (a) Provisional auroral electrojet indices on 27 December 1997. (b) Filtered (4\u201310 mHz)\nH-component magnetic field perturbations at midlatitude Kvistaberg (KVI) station. The vertical dotted\nlines indicate the onset times of the poleward boundary intensification (PBI) -Pi2 bursts.\nA01217 KIM ET AL.: PBI-PI2 PULSATIONS\n3 of 15\nA01217\ntudes of the fluctuations in the X and Z components at\nHOP and BJN were much larger for the interval from\n2100 to 2200 UT than that from 1900 to 2100 UT. This\nindicates that the electrojet intensification was localized\naround the midnight. Although several negative excur-\nsions in the X component occurred at magnetic latitudes\nabove 71\u0001 look like negative bays, their magnitudes were\nsignificantly less than for typical substorms. There were\nno negative excursions of the X component at latitudes\nbelow 67\u0001. These observations suggest that the Pi2\npulsations are associated with PBIs but not with sub-\nstorms, as noticed in SL02. Events B to F occurred during\nnegative excursions of the X component at the higher-\nlatitude stations (Ny lesund (NAL) to BJN), while event\nA was not accompanied by the negative perturbation.\n[13] The midlatitude, low-latitude, and dip equator H\ncomponent data filtered by removing 600-s running aver-\nages are plotted in Figure 3. The magnetic latitude,\nmagnetic local time at 2000 UT, and L value are plotted\nto the right and left of each magnetic trace. Oulu (OUL),\nYork (YOR), and HER are located on similar local time\nmeridians, in the premidnight sector during the interval,\n1800\u20132200 UT. KAK and Ancon (ANC) were located in\nthe postmidnight and afternoon dip equator, respectively,\nfor the 4-hour interval. The PBI-Pi2 bursts are clearly seen\nat OUL, YOR, and HER in the premidnight sector. Their\namplitude at HER is smaller that that at OUL and YOR by\na factor of \u00012. Although we can identify the magnetic\nfield perturbations during events A to C at KAK in the\npostmidnight sector starting at the onset times of the Pi2\nbursts in the premidnight sector, the PBI-Pi2 pulsations at\nKAK are not as clear as at the stations in the premidnight.\nKAK was located near the dawnside (0500\u20130600 MLT)\nduring the intervals of events D to F and had no\nperturbations similar to those occurring at HER, YOR,\nand OUL. These indicate that the region of the pulsations\nwas not extended to dawn. The PBI-Pi2 pulsations at the\nafternoon dip equator (ANC) are quite similar to those in\nthe premidnight sector. Their amplitude was strongly\nenhanced and comparable to that at OUL. This enhance-\nment at the dayside equator is similar to the substorm-\nassociated Pi2 pulsations [Shinohara et al., 1997, 1998].\n[14] Figures 4a and 4b show the band-integrated (3\u2013\n25 mHz) amplitude APi2 and frequency with a well-\ndefined spectral peak in a moving 10-min time window,\nrespectively, using the autoregressive spectral analysis\ntechnique for the H-component ground station data in\nFigure 3. Detailed descriptions of this technique are given\nby Takahashi et al. [2002a]. The vertical dashed lines are\nthe same as in Figure 1. Repetitive enhancements of the\nband-integrated amplitude, each of which is due to a\nPBI-Pi2 burst, are clearly seen at the longitudinally and\nlatitudinally separated five ground stations. The APi2 varia-\ntions are almost identical among the stations. As shown in\nSL02 (see Figure 4 in their study), the PBI-Pi2 bursts\nexhibit an excellent correlation with energetic particle\nenhancement in the plasma sheet. The particle enhance-\nments and Pi2s are consequence of the large-scale processes\nthat give rise to plasma sheet flow bursts and associated\nplasma sheet magnetic field variations.\n     \n \n A B C D E F\n1800 1900 2000 2100 2200\nUniversal Time\nX-comp. 40 nT\/div\n     \n \n A B C D E F\n1800 1900 2000 2100 2200\nUniversal Time\nZ-comp. 40 nT\/div\nSite (CGM)\nNAL (76.1)\nLYR (75.1)\nHOR (74.3)\nHOP (72.9)\nBJN (71.4)\nTRO (66.6)\nKIL (65.8)\nMUO (64.6)\nFigure 2. X and Z component magnetic field data at International Monitor for Auroral Geomagnetic\nEffects (IMAGE) stations.\nA01217 KIM ET AL.: PBI-PI2 PULSATIONS\n4 of 15\nA01217\n[15] Frequencies of spectral peaks in the bandwidth, 3\u2013\n25 mHz, are plotted in Figure 4b. The arrows indicate\naround the frequencies corresponding to the amplitude\npeaks for events A to F. The peak frequencies are distributed\nbetween 4 and 10 mHz. During events A and B, the\nfrequency at YOR was slightly higher than that at OUL.\nBy contrast, events C and E show identical frequencies at\nYOR and OUL. Low-latitude KAK station in the postmid-\nnight observed lower frequencies than at HER and YOR in\nthe premidnight for events A and D. The frequency peaks at\nANC are slightly different from those at other stations\nexcept for event B. From the variability of the frequency\nalong the latitudes in the same time period, we suggest that\nthe PBI-Pi2 perturbations observed in the middle\/low lat-\nitudes are not dominated by only one mode structure such as\na fast mode wave trapped in the plasmasphere [e.g.,\nTakahashi et al., 2001], which is mostly favored for a\nmodel of substorm-Pi2 pulsations in the inner magneto-\nsphere or at middle\/low latitudes.\n[16] We examine whether the PBI-Pi2 pulsations are\ndirectly related to the westward current centered near at\nHOP (CGM = 73\u0001). Figure 5a shows the raw and 10-min\nrunning averages of the X-component at HOP and the\nbandpass filtered (4\u201310 mHz) H component at KVI\n(CGM = 56\u0001). HOP and KVI are located at similar local\ntimes 2378 MLT and 2213 MLT at 2200 UT, respectively.\nAs mentioned in Figure 2, the HOP data are characterized\nby a series of negative perturbations due to enhancements of\nthe westward electrojet, which are associated with energetic\nparticle flux enhancements within the plasma sheet. From\nHOP and KVI data, we confirm that the PBI-Pi2 bursts and\nthe decrease in X at HOP are highly correlated except for\nevent A, which may be due to the fact that the event was\nobserved away from midnight. For events B to F the onset\ntimes of the bursts and the decrease in X are different. That\nis, the Pi2 bursts are enhanced \u00012\u20136 min after the X\ndecrease. Such a timing difference between high-latitude\nX component decrease and lower-latitude Pi2 onset is also\nreported by Kepko et al. [2004]. The PBI-Pi2 bursts\ndisappear while the HOP X component increases. These\nobservations imply that the electrojet is not the initial cause\nof the PBI-Pi2 oscillations at midlatitude but that the\nenhancements of the PBI-Pi2 bursts are modulated from\nthe intensification of the electrojet current.\n[17] It is believed that the ionospheric currents are fed by\nfield-aligned currents, which is connected to the plasma\nsheet and directed downward in the postmidnight sector and\nupward in the premidnight sector. That is, if the currents\nFigure 3. High-pass-filtered time series of ground data. The filtering was done by removing running\n600-s average from the 5-s data.\nA01217 KIM ET AL.: PBI-PI2 PULSATIONS\n5 of 15\nA01217\nflow on the wedge-shaped circuit, as expected during sub-\nstorm onsets, the positive (negative) D perturbations in\nFigure 5b can be interpreted as that OUL and YOR in the\npremidnight (KAK in the postmidnight) was located west\n(east) of the center of the current wedge [Clauer and\nMcPherron, 1974]. The H (D) component at YOR exhibits\nthe negative (positive) perturbations for events A, B, C, and\nD, indicating that the station was located west of the upward\nfield-aligned current part of the wedge. OUL showed the\nstrong positive D perturbation for events B and C, but a\nbaseline change in H was not clear as much as at YOR. This\nindicates that OUL was close to the upward field-aligned\ncurrent. The positive perturbations in H and D at OUL and\nYOR for event F imply that both stations were inside the\ncurrent wedge.\n3.2. Latitudinal Wave Characteristics\n[18] Both latitudinal and longitudinal structures are im-\nportant in determining the cause of the Pi2 pulsations. We\nexamine the latitudinal structure first. Figure 6 shows the\ndata for events A and B from nine stations located in the\npremidnight sector (1900\u20132300 MLT). The ground data\nhave been filtered by removing 600-s running averages\nfrom H and D components. Selected stations at higher\nlatitudes and lower latitudes are grouped into Figures 6a\nand 6b, respectively. The vertical dashed lines indicate the\npeaks of the perturbations at YOR.\n[19] During event A, the oscillations in the H component\nat lower latitudes (Figure 6b) started simultaneously at\naround 1830 UT, but after one cycle a considerable phase\nlag appeared among the stations. The phase lag was smaller\nbetween YOR and KVI than between YOR and OUL. The\nphase lag increases gradually with increasing latitudes. This\nindicates that the perturbations at OUL, KVI, and YOR are\nexcited by a common source and then they showed latitude-\ndependent oscillations (i.e., slightly longer period at higher\nlatitude). However, the D component at OUL and KVI has\nno phase delay with the H component at YOR. That is, the\noscillations in D at OUL and KVI and in H at YOR have\nnearly identical waveform. The power spectrum of the\nperturbations in H and D at OUL and YOR for event A\nis plotted in Figure 7. The spectrum was obtained using\nthe maximum entropy method [Ulrich and Bishop, 1975]\nwith the number of the poles of six. The OUL D and YOR\nH and D have an identical spectral peak at 6 mHz, but OUL\nH has a spectral peak at 5 mHz. This suggests that the\ngeneration mechanisms of the perturbations in H and D at\nOUL are different. The amplitude at HER is smaller than\nthat at SAMNET by a factor of \u00012. The D and H\ncomponents at HER oscillate out of phase. The D at HER\nin the southern hemisphere also oscillates out of phase with\nthe D at OUL and KVI in the northern hemisphere. This\nsignature would be expected when a motion of field lines\nis symmetric with respect to the magnetic equator. The\nFigure 4. (a) Band-integrated (3\u201325 mHz) amplitude APi2 and (b) frequencies at the spectral peaks at\nmidlatitude, low-latitude, and equatorial ground stations.\nA01217 KIM ET AL.: PBI-PI2 PULSATIONS\n6 of 15\nA01217\noscillations in the H component at YOR and HER show\nnearly identical waveforms without a phase delay.\n[20] A similar feature appears in the first two peaks of\nevent B at the SAMNET stations. However, there is no\nphase delay for the third peak of event B, and its amplitude\nsuddenly increased at OUL. This suggests that the field\nperturbations of event B were not due to a single source. It\nis obvious that the pulsation\u2019s period in H increases with\nincreasing latitude from 51\u0001 to 62\u0001 for the intervals, 1840\u2013\n1900 UT and 1910\u20131930 UT. That is, the period is longest\nat OUL and shortest at YOR. On the basis of these\nobservations, we suggest that events A and B at the\nmiddle\/low latitudes in the premidnight sector are attributed\nto latitudinally localized Alfve\u00b4n waves. At KVI and YOR,\nthe pulsations in the D component are much weaker than\nthose in the H component, whereas the amplitude of the D\ncomponent oscillation at OUL is comparable to that in H.\n[21] The oscillations in the H and D components at\nMuonio (MUO) are similar to those at OUL (note different\namplitude scale). For event A the H perturbations at BJN and\nNAL are roughly out of phase with H at MUO. The negative\npeak in H at HOP was earlier than that at higher (Hornsund\n(HOR), NLA) and lower (BJN) latitudes. Event B also shows\na similar signature. The amplitude of the perturbations was\nlargest around HOP for events A and B. These observations\nindicate that the source of the perturbations at high latitude is\nlocated near HOP and that the source moves higher and\nlower latitudes. Although the negative perturbations at the\nhigh latitudes appear to correspond to the positive pertur-\nbations at the lower latitudes, the generation mechanism at\nthe middle\/low latitudes may be different from that at high\nlatitudes because there is no phase delay between OUL\nand HER at the first and third peaks of event B.\n[22] Figure 8 shows the time series plot of event E using\nthe same format as Figure 6. The SAMNET\/IMAGE stations\nand HER were located in \u00012150\u20130060 MLT. Unlike event\nA, the H component of event E has no apparent phase delay\nfrom OUL (L \u0001 4.5) to HER (L \u0001 1.9). The phase signature\nof event F (not shown) is similar to event E. The H and\nD components at OUL are roughly out of phase but in\nphase at YOR. Large fluctuations in the H and D\ncomponents were observed at BJN and HOP. Their\nwaveform and period differ from those at lower and higher\nlatitudes. There are quasi-periodic perturbations at NAR\nFigure 5.

However, their period also differs from that at\nthe SAMNET\/HER stations.\n[23] The interstation coherence and cross phase of events\nE and F were examined using the technique described\nby Takahashi et al. [2001] and the results are plotted in\nFigure 9. The solid (open) circles indicate event E (F). The\ncoherence between YOR and other stations was calculated at\nthe dominant frequency, 5 mHz (4.4 mHz) for event E (F).\nFigure 9b shows the amplitude ratio of the H component\nnormalized to the value at YOR. The normalized amplitude\nand cross phase are plotted when the coherence was more\nthan 0.8. High coherence occurs at MLAT < 65\u0001 (L < 5.6)\nwith a cross phase of \u00010\u0001. The normalized amplitude\nincreases with increasing latitude. The spectral peak at\nhigher latitudes (MLAT >65\u0001) occurs at lower frequency,\nas expected from Figure 8. As a consequence, coherence was\nlow, implying that the source of the perturbations at high\nlatitudes and at middle\/low latitudes is different.\n[24] Figure 10 shows the ground magnetic field data for\nevent C. Although the magnetic perturbations at SAMNET\/\nHER have irregular amplitude and period, the waveforms\nof the H perturbations from MUO to HER are nearly\nidentical. The H-component data at high latitudes from\nBJN to NAL show also irregular form and some perturba-\ntions look like to oscillate out of phase with the lower-\nlatitude data.\n3.3. Longitudinal Wave Characteristics\n[25] We examine the longitudinal properties of the Pi2\npulsations using Figures 11 and 12. Figure 11 shows the\nH component of CPMN and YOR data for events E and F.\nThe H-component oscillations at the afternoon dip equator\nare nearly identical to those at YOR and exhibit no phase\ndelay. Their amplitude is comparable to the perturbations at\nYOR. Similar H perturbations are observed at the postmid-\nnight low-latitude stations at Yamakawa (YMK), Lunpin\n(LNP), and Muntinlupa (MUT) with much smaller ampli-\ntude but not at Tixie (TIK) and Magadan (MGD). The\nperturbations at Popov Island (PPI) were not clear as\nmuch as those at YOR. These observations suggest that\nFigure 6.

The step-like variations at Ny lesund\n(NAL), HOP, and Bear Island (BJN) are due to a magnetic resolution of \u00011 nT. The filtering was done by\nremoving running 600-s average from the 5-s data. The vertical dashed lines indicate the peak\nperturbations at York (YOR).\nA01217 KIM ET AL.: PBI-PI2 PULSATIONS\n8 of 15\nA01217\nthe PBI-Pi2 pulsations were localized to latitudes lower\nthan \u000165\u0001 and to local time earlier than \u00010500 MLT.\n[26] The pulsations observed in the postmidnight sector\nduring events A and B are plotted in Figure 12a. Unlike in\nFigure 11, MGD (0410 MLT) observed similar H perturba-\ntions to those at lower latitudes in the postmidnight, which\nare nearly identical to the perturbations at YOR, with a\nphase delay of \u0001180\u0001. The amplitude of the perturbations at\nANC is larger that that at YOR. Following the vertical\ndashed lines in Figure 12a, we find that the second peaks of\nevents A and B at YOR lead those at ANC. As shown in\nFigure 6, such a signature occurred at higher latitudes\n(KVI and OUL). To emphasize this point, we have plotted\nthe H-component data from the SAMNET stations with the\nANC data in Figure 12b. Although the dominant pertur-\nbations at ANC are quite similar to those at SAMNET\nstations, the dayside dip equator perturbations are more\nclosely related to the perturbations at higher latitudes than\nat YOR in terms of a phase variation.\n3.4.

Same as Figure 6, but for the interval of event E.\nA01217 KIM ET AL.: PBI-PI2 PULSATIONS\n9 of 15\nA01217\n1800\u20132200 UT. The satellite locations are plotted with\nthe solid lines, marked every 1 hour by the solid circles.\nThe orbital plane of the Polar spacecraft was close to the\ndawn-dusk meridian. During the interval from 1900 to\n2200 UT, Polar crossed L shells between \u00013 and \u000115 in\nthe 1800\u20131900 MLT sector, moving from 2.1 to 6.4 RE\ngeocentric distance.\n[28] Figure 14 shows the plasma density estimated from\nthe spacecraft potential data [Scudder et al., 2000] and the\nlocation of Polar as a function of universal time, using the\nmagnetic shell parameter L. There are spiky variations\nand the large dip in the plasma density between 1918 and\n1947 UT. This is due to instrumental errors (available at\nhttp:\/\/lepefi.gsfc.nasa.gov\/\u0001polarefi), occurring in the\nplasmasphere near perigee (\u00011.8 RE). The plasma density\ndid not have a simple radial structure. Polar observed\nquasi-periodic density variations in the range of \u000140\u2013\n300 cm\u00033 between L \u0001 5 and L \u0001 7. Since a typical\nplasmapause crossing is characterized by a density decrease\nfrom above 100 cm\u00033 to below 10 cm\u00033, we do not\nattribute such variations to plasmapause crossings. They\ncould be considered as a temporal or spatial density\nchange in the plasmasphere.\n[29] The density decreased from 100 cm\u00033 at \u00012050 UT\nto below 10 cm\u00033 \u00012125 UT, corresponding to an L range\nfrom 7 to 10. We suggest that a plasmapause was located\nsomewhere beyond L \u00017. Such a plasmapause\u2019s location\ncan be expected in the duskside region during a quiet\ngeomagnetic condition, Kp \u0005 1 [Chappell, 1972]. At small\nradial distance the despun magnetic and electric field data\nare contaminated by artificial oscillations, and at L >10 very\nirregular field perturbations were observed. Clean segment\nof the field data from Polar was the interval from \u00012030 to\n\u00012130 UT.\n[30] Figure 15a shows the time series of compressional\nmagnetic field (bzMFA), azimuthal magnetic field (byMFA),\nand radial electric field (Exy) components for event E. The\nExy and the smoothed traces in bzMFA and byMFA are\nfiltered in the frequency band 2\u201310 mHz. The perturba-\ntions in B56 are nearly identical to those in \u0003byMFA (not\nshown here). It is clear that the Exy oscillated in phase\nwith byMFA at \u000134\u0001\u201337\u0001 magnetic latitude, indicating that\nthe Alfve\u00b4n mode is propagating. Such a propagating\nAlfve\u00b4n mode at high magnetic latitudes in the plasma-\nsphere has been reported by Osaki et al. [1998]. The\ncompressional (bzMFA) and azimuthal (byMFA) components\nhave different period.\n[31] Oscillations in space and on the ground for event E\nare compared in Figure 15b. The figure includes the H\ncomponent at OUL (L \u0001 4.5) and YOR (L \u0001 2.6), filtered\nby removing 10-min running average, and the byMFA com-\nponent at Polar, filtered in the frequency band 2\u201310 mHz.\nNote that byMFA in Figure 15b is shifted to the left by 50 s in\norder to match the ground perturbations. The ground H\ncomponent has a great similarity with the perturbation in\nbyMFA. This implies that the ground perturbations are asso-\nciated with the transverse mode in space rather than the\ncompressional mode.\n4. Discussion\n[32] Previous observations on the ground at middle\/low\nlatitudes [e.g., Stuart, 1974; Yeoman and Orr, 1989; Lin et\nal., 1991] and in space in the inner (L < 5) magnetosphere\n[Takahashi et al., 1995] showed that the plasmaspheric\ncavity mode (i.e., fast-mode waves trapped in the plasma-\nsphere) is a promising mechanism for Pi2 pulsations. The\nfrequency of the plasmaspheric cavity mode depends on the\nradial distance of the plasmapause [Takahashi et al.,\n2003]. We suggested from the Polar data that the plasma-\npause was located at L \u0006 7. For this distance, the cavity\nmode frequency is expected to be less than 6.5 mHz,\nassuming simple box geometry and a constant Alfve\u00b4n\nvelocity, 500 km\/s [Takahashi et al., 2003]. The peak\nfrequencies of events A\u2013F in our study are within the\nband of \u00014\u201310 mHz. Thus our PBI-Pi2 events observed\nat middle\/low latitudes could be the plasmaspheric cavity\nmode in terms of frequency.\n[33] However, the latitude-dependence of the frequency\nduring events A and B argues against the plasmaspheric\ncavity mode because an identical frequency at latitudinally\nextended stations inside the plasmasphere is expected. The\namplitude maxima in the H\/X component near the location,\nthe magnetic latitude between 65\u0001 and 71\u0001, of the phase\nreversal during events A and B (see Figure 6) in the\nFigure 9. Interstation (a) coherence, (b) amplitude ratio,\nwhich is defined as the square root of other stationH to YOR\nH power ratio, and (c) cross phase for the H component of\nevents E (solid circles) and F (open circles).\nA01217 KIM ET AL.: PBI-PI2 PULSATIONS\n10 of 15\nA01217\npremidnight sector would be attributed to that the field line is\nconnected to the source region or to the region of strong\nmode conversion [Chen and Hasegawa, 1974; Southwood,\n1974]. The amplitude variation with latitude near a phase-\njump location is opposite to that expected from the cavity\nmode model of Pi2 [Takahashi et al., 1995] if compressional\noscillation maps to the northward (H\/X) component on the\nground without phase shift [e.g., Takahashi et al., 1999]. In\nthe postmidnight sector the phase reversal occurred around\n54\u0001 magnetic latitude (see Figure 12). This would be\ninterpreted as that the location of the mode conversion in\nthe premidnight and postmidnight is different.\n[34] Recently, Kepko and Kivelson [1999] proposed that\nthe midlatitude\/low-latitude Pi2 pulsations can be driven\nby fast-mode pulses generated as periodic bursty bulk\nflows brake in the near-Earth magnetotail. Kepko et al.\n[2001] suggested that Pi2 pulsations have different features\nat different locations along latitude and longitude. Accord-\ning to their model, current perpendicular to the magnetic\nfield and directed dawnward is generated by the inertia\neffect of flow braking. The perpendicular current is\ndiverted into the field-aligned currents that flow on a\nwedge-shaped circuit connected to the ionosphere. The\ncurrent system decays as the flow disappears but it inten-\nsifies again when the next flow burst arrives. Although the\nmagnetotail observations by the Geotail spacecraft missed\nthe fast earthward flow bursts during the interval in our\nstudy because the spacecraft was far away from the Sun-\nEarth line, SL02 showed that the PBI-Pi2 bursts are\nstrongly correlated with external source (i.e., energetic\nparticle enhancements). Therefore our PBI-Pi2 events\nmay have source dependent signatures. The period and\nduration of the pulsation may be determined at the source.\nEvent C showed very irregular waveform and period (see\nFigure 10) even though it occurred during a period of\nextremely quiet geomagnetic condition.\n[35] From the time-modulated current model [Kepko et\nal., 2001], three effects can be expected: (1) The region of\nperpendicular current acts as a source of propagating fast\nmode pulses. The pulse propagates earthward across the\nequatorial magnetic field and produces equatorial Pi2 pul-\nsations on the ground. (2) Field-aligned current produces\nadditional ground perturbations on east-west component at\nmidlatitude. (3) The fast-mode pulses propagating on the\nflank side forces the field lines to oscillate azimuthally,\nresulting in Alfve\u00b4nic perturbations in the flankside magne-\ntosphere, and such Alfve\u00b4nic perturbations are observed in\nthe northward (H\/X) component on the ground.\nFigure 10. Same as Figure 6, but for the interval of event C.\nA01217 KIM ET AL.: PBI-PI2 PULSATIONS\n11 of 15\nA01217\n[36] We showed that event A has a spectral peak at 5 mHz\nin the H component at OUL but a spectral peak at 6 mHz in\nOUL D and YOR H\/D (see Figure 7). Since YOR and OUL\nwere outside the expected current wedge in the premidnight\nsector (1910\u20132130 MLT) for event A, the initial positive\nH perturbations at midlatitudes exclude the field-aligned\ncurrent model. The H-component oscillation at OUL may\nbe categorized as frankside Pi2 associated with Alfve\u00b4nic\nsignature discussed by Kepko and Kivelson [1999] and\nKepko et al. [2001] (see their Figure 15).\n[37] According to a statistical study of fundamental\nstanding Alfve\u00b4n waves [Takahashi et al., 2002b], the\n5-mHz fundamental standing Alfve\u00b4n waves are expected at\nL \u0001 8\u201310 in the duskside. Therefore the 5-mHz oscillation\nis far from the fundamental standing Alfve\u00b4n wave frequency\nat OUL (L \u0001 4.5). That is, it is not clear whether the 5-mHz\noscillation on the ground is caused by Alfve\u00b4n resonance at\nL \u0001 4.5. We suggest that the H-component oscillations at\nOUL would result from transient Alfve\u00b4nic perturbations\nexcited by a series of compressional pulses, which may be\nassociated with braking of oscillatory earthward flows.\n[38] The interstation coherence and cross-phase analysis\nof the H component of events E and F showed that the high\ncoherence occurs at middle\/low latitudes (MLAT < 65\u0001)\nwithout a phase delay and that the amplitude of high-\ncoherence event increases with increasing latitude (Figure 9).\nThe large amplitude at higher latitudes indicates that the\nsource of the perturbations is at higher latitudes. Such a\nsource would be considered as field-aligned current associ-\nated with perpendicular current [Kepko et al., 2001]. Event\nF was inside of the current wedge as mentioned above\n(Figure 5). Although the background bay signature was not\nclear to identify ground locations with respect to the current\nwedge for event E, the out of phase (in phase) H and D\ncomponents at OUL (YOR) would be expected from the\nfield-aligned current model if both stations are inside the\ncurrent wedge and YOR (OUL) is close to the western\n(eastern) field-aligned current part. Note that OUL was\nlocated \u00012 hours east of YOR.\n[39] The PBI-Pi2 pulsations at midlatitude were not seen\nin the dawnside but occurred in the duskside. This longitu-\ndinal asymmetry may indicate a localization of the source\ndisturbance. If the PBI-Pi2 events are associated with the\nearthward flow bursts in the magnetotail, the flow channel is\nskewed to the premidnight region [Angelopoulos et al.,\n1996].\n[40] Polar in the duskside at \u000134\u0001\u201337\u0001 magnetic lati-\ntude observed compressional and transverse oscillations\nduring event E. We have compared the oscillations in\nspace and H on the ground and find that the ground Pi2\npulsations have nearly the same period as the transverse\noscillations in space. Previous ground-satellite observations\nnear midnight [e.g., Takahashi et al., 1995; Keiling et al.,\n2001] and near dawn [Nose\u00b4 et al., 2003] showed that ground\nPi2 pulsations are correlated with the compressional oscil-\nlations near the magnetic equator. Osaki et al. [1998]\nreported that no Pi2 pulsations was detected in the com-\npressional component at \u000130\u0001\u201340\u0001 magnetic latitude near\nmidnight and that the period of the ground Pi2 pulsations\nwas nearly identical to that in the transverse component.\nFigure 11. High-pass-filtered time series of selected CPMN\/YOR stations.\nA01217 KIM ET AL.: PBI-PI2 PULSATIONS\n12 of 15\nA01217\nFrom these observations we suggest that the spacecraft\nsignatures depend on the local times as well as magnetic\nlatitude. As shown in Figure 15, L dependence of frequency\nin the transverse component was not clear. Therefore the\ntransverse perturbations near dusk may be transient\nAlfve\u00b4nic mode associated with the fast mode pulses\npropagating on the flank side, which are caused by flow\nbraking [Kepko et al., 2001].\n[41] We showed that the PBI-Pi2 bursts at middle\/low\nlatitudes are correlated with the negative bay disturbances\n(i.e., PBI) at current source region (magnetic latitude =\n\u000173\u0001) but that the initial perturbations of the Pi2 pulsations\ndo not match with the onset time of the bay disturbance.\nThat is, the Pi2 bursts are enhanced \u00012\u20136 min after the\nnegative bay. This indicates that the source of the negative\nbay is located further away from the Earth in the tail than\nthe source region of the PBI-Pi2 pulsations.\n5. Conclusions\n[42] We have examined the PBI-Pi2 pulsations that\noccurred during the absence of substorms and during\nground state geomagnetic conditions (Kp = 0). As noticed\nin SL02, the PBI-Pi2 bursts occurred periodically every\n\u000130 min and were correlated with bay-like disturbances at\nhigh latitudes, associated with energetic particle enhance-\nments in the plasma sheet. The bay-like disturbances are\nconsidered as a result of westward electrojet currents flow-\nFigure 12. (a) Same as Figure 11, but for the interval of events A and B. (b) Comparison of the\nH-component perturbations at the dayside dip equator and the selected nightside midlatitudes.\nA01217 KIM ET AL.: PBI-PI2 PULSATIONS\n13 of 15\nA01217\ning around 73\u0001 magnetic latitude. Although the PBI-Pi2\nbursts are correlated with the negative disturbances, the\ninitial cause of the PBI-Pi2 pulsations is not the westward\ncurrent. We observed that the PBI-Pi2 pulsations at middle\/\nlow latitudes have different features at different local times,\nthat is, Alfve\u00b4nic signatures near the duskside and no phase\ndelay near the midnight with latitudes. These observations\ncould be interpreted by the model presented by Kepko et al.\n[2001]. According to their model, the period and duration of\nthe Pi2 pulsation are determined at a source region, where\nfast earthward flows brake. The PBI-Pi2 pulsations in our\nstudy have an irregular period and amplitude even though\nduring very quite geomagnetic condition. Our observations\nwould be attributed to source dependent signature rather\nthan plasmaspheric cavity mode. However, we need a direct\nFigure 13.
