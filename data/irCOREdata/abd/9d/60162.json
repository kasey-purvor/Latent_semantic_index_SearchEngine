An active geothermal system has been present \nthere for at least 50 years, expressed at the surface by numerous hot springs, fumaroles and areas of steaming ground. During a 2005 \nfield campaign, samples of water and steam were collected from geothermal features and non-thermal springs and wells, and \nrepresentative samples of altered rocks and geothermal precipitates were collected from geothermal areas. \nAnalysis of the waters for anion, cation and stable isotope composition shows that the waters discharging to the surface fall into two \ngroups.  \n \n  Rembokola Type Reoka Type \nTemperature (\u00b0C) 102 100 \npH 8.2 2.5 \nSO42- (ppm) 653 516 \n\u03b434SSO4 \u2030 +5.7 \u00b11 -2.9  \u00b11 \nCl- (ppm) 50 4 \nAl (ppb) <350 827 \nCa (ppm) 129 58 \nFe (ppm) <0.1 24 \nNa (ppm) 220 45 \n \nThe Reoka Type fluids have the high sulphate, low pH, and enriched \u03b418O and \u03b4D values typical of steam heated acid sulphate \nwaters, where shallow groundwater is heated by rising steam and gas. Hydrogen sulphide is oxidised in the near surface environment \nto produce the sulphate content and native sulphur sublimates. The host rocks and\/or sediments for Reoka Type fluids are typically \naltered to kaolinite with alunite, gypsum and barite.  \nRembokola Type fluids have chemistry distinct from the Reoka Type fluids, despite the two being found in hot springs within close \nproximity. Rembokola Type fluids are often produce a carbonate sinter, so are assumed to be saturated with bicarbonate. The \naqueous sulphate has a heavy \u03b434S, suggesting that the source of sulphate is not exclusively the oxidation of hydrogen sulphide gas or \nsulphide minerals in the near surface environment. We suggest that condensation of volcanic gases (dominantly water vapour but \nincluding carbon dioxide and isotopically heavy sulphur dioxide) into meteoric-derived groundwater in the upper levels of the \nvolcanic edifice produces these carbonate-sulphate waters. The presence of sulphur dioxide at high levels in the volcanic edifice \nsuggests that there is a degassing magma at depth, and potentially a high sulphidation-type epithermal system beneath the steam \nheated zone.  \n"}
