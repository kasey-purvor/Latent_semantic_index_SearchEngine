The 3 and 4-electron states of a gated semiconducting carbon nanotube quantum\ndot are calculated by exact diagonalisation of a modified effective mass Hamiltonian. A typical\nnanotube quantum dot is examined and the few-electron states are Wigner molecule-like. The\nexact diagonalisation method and the rate of convergence of the calculation are discussed.\n1. Introduction\nIn a gated semiconductor nanotube (SNT) quantum dot, electrons or holes are confined\nelectrostatically. The occupancy of this type of dot can be precisely controlled and, importantly,\na semiconducting nanotube dot can be completely emptied of electrons. This means that SNT\nquantum dots are excellent systems in which to study the physics of a few interacting particles.\nLike traditional semiconductor quantum dots, SNT dots behave like artificial atoms but\nthere are some differences that make semiconducting carbon nanotube dots unique. First, the\nSNT bandstructure is unusual, primarily because nanotubes are rolled graphene sheets and the\nnanotube bandstructure is derived from that of graphene. Second, the geometry of SNT dots\nis also unusual: the nanotube length is very much greater than its diameter and so SNT dots\nare quasi-1 dimensional objects. In Ref. [1] we demonstrated that the electronic correlation was\nlarge in a large proportion of all physically accessible SNT quantum dots. Taken together with\nthe tube geometry, this means that SNT dots are ideal systems in which to observe quasi-1D\nWigner (or all-electron) molecules.\nIn our approach, we describe the few particle states in a SNT quantum dot with a 1\ndimensional, 2 band, effective mass Hamiltonian [1]. However, because the electron correlation is\nstrong and the few-particle states are Wigner molecule-like, care must be taken in the calculation\nof the electron states: exact diagonalisation, or configuration interaction (CI), techniques must\nbe used to include the correlation effects correctly. In this paper we give an overview of our\neffective mass description of SNT dots and then discuss the exact diagonalisation scheme in\ndetail. We examine the convergence of the few-electron states and discuss a way of truncating\nthe full CI basis which improves the convergence of the few-electron energy.\n2. Effective mass description of a nanotube dot\nOur dot model is based on the type of semiconducting nanotube quantum dot that is typically\nstudied experimentally [2]. In this type of device, a long (\u223c \u00b5m) nanotube is contacted between\nsource and drain electrodes and separated from a back-gate by a thin insulating layer. The\nquantum dot potential is generated electrostatically by applying a voltage to the back-gate and,\nin our model, this confinement potential varies parabolically along the length of the tube.\nThe confined states of a typical SNT dot are broad and may extend over a few hundred\nnanometres (of the order of a few hundred thousand atoms). However, although the states are\nbroad, their extent is much less than the typical source-drain separation and so we assume our\ndot is completely isolated. The energy scale of a SNT dot is typically of the order of a few to\nten meV, much less than the typical SNT band gap (\u223c 1 eV). So, given that the dot length\nscale is also much larger than the SNT unit cell length, the few-particle states in the dot can be\ndescribed with an effective mass theory. However, there are new features which must be added\nto the theory to take account of the unusual nanotube bandstructure.\nNanotubes are rolled graphene sheets, and in each SNT there are two equivalent conduction\nbands with minima equally spaced either side of k = 0. The two conduction bands arise from\nthe equivalence of the K and K \u2032 points in the graphene Brillouin zone and there is an additional\ncomplication because the dispersion near to each of these points in the graphene zone is linear.\nIn Ref. [1] we demonstrated how to deal with both these effects by expanding the SNT dot\nstates in terms of the two-component Bloch wavefunctions of graphene. The net result is a 1D,\n2-band effective mass Hamiltonian with a modified Coulomb interaction, U , that contains all of\nthe effects of the nanotube bandstructure and the details of the nanotube geometry,\nH =\nN\u2211\ni=1\n[\n\u2212h\u00af2\n2m\u2217\nd2\ndz2i\n+\nm\u2217\u03c92\n2\nz2i\n]\n+\n\u03c1\/R\n2\u000fr\n\u2211\ni 6=j\nU(zi \u2212 zj , R). (1)\nHere N is the number of electrons, h\u00af\u03c9 is the parabolic confinement energy, R is the SNT radius,\n\u000fr is the dielectric constant, m\u2217 is the effective mass, \u03c1 = e2\/(4pi\u000fo) and\nU(z,R) =\n1\n4\n(2u(z,R) + u(z \u2212 3R,R) + u(z + 3R,R)). (2)\nu(z,R) is derived from the standard form of the interaction between charged particles on the\nsurface of a cylinder,\nu(z,R) =\n2R\npi\n\u221a\nz2 + 4R2\nK\n(\n2R\u221a\nz2 + 4R2\n)\n, (3)\nand K is an elliptic integral of the first kind which diverges like log(z\/R) as z \u2192 0.\nEq. (2) gives the intraband effective interaction. We ignore the interband interaction because\nits effect is small [3, 4]. In this case the band index acts like a pseudospin and our Hamiltonian\nis block diagonal in both the total electron spin and the pseudospin.\n3. Exact diagonalisation\nTo calculate the N particle energies and wavefunctions we must solve the Schro\u00a8dinger equation,\nH\u03a8(z1 . . . zN ) = E\u03a8(z1 . . . zN ). We expand the N particle states, \u03a8(z1 . . . zN ), as a sum of\nSlater determinants, \u03a6i(z1 . . . zN ), constructed from the single particle states of the system,\n\u03a8(z1 . . . zN ) =\n\u2211\ni\nai\u03a6i(z1 . . . zN ), (4)\nwhere each \u03a6i(z1 . . . zn) is a normalised eigenfunction of the total spin, S and its z component Sz.\nIn principle, this expansion is exact. However, in reality, the basis set can never be truly complete\nand must be truncated. In our calculation we use a slight variation of the full configuration\ninteraction scheme in which all the possible determinants that can be generated from a given\nfinite single particle basis set are included in the expansion. The size of our finite basis is then\ndetermined by a single parameter, a maximum quantum number n, and we can systematically\nconverge our calculation of the few particle states simply by increasing n.\nTo solve the Schro\u00a8dinger equation numerically we first transform it into a standard matrix\neigenvalue equation by left multiplying with one of the determinants from the expansion in Eq.\n(4) and integrating over all the z1 . . . zN spatial coordinates. We have\u2211\ni\n(\u3008\u03a6j |H|\u03a6i\u3009 \u2212 E\u03b4ij) ai = 0,\nor, in matrix notation,\n(H\u2212 EI) a = 0,\nwhere I is the unit matrix. To find the N particle energies and the expansion coefficients, ai, we\ndiagonalise this Hamiltonian matrix numerically. The calculation time scales as the size of the\nmatrix cubed and, to reduce this time, we block the Hamiltonian matrix according to the total\npseudospin and the symmetry of each N particle state along the nanotube.\nTo reduce the size of the calculation we also slightly modify the full CI scheme. Our basis\nfunctions span a multi-dimensional Hilbert space, but we find that states from the \u2019corners\u2019 of\nthis space do not contribute significantly to the few-electron wavefunctions. So, if\n\u03a6i(z1 . . . zN ) =\n1\u221a\nN !\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n\u03c6mi1(z1) \u03c6mi2(z1) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u03c6miN (z1)\n\u03c6mi1(z2) \u03c6mi2(z2) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u03c6miN (z2)\n...\n...\n...\n\u03c6mi1(zN ) \u03c6mi2(zN ) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u03c6miN (zN )\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 , (5)\nwe find ai to be negligible if all the mij quantum numbers are large. We therefore neglect\ndeterminants from these \u2019corners\u2019 and use a \u2019spherical cut off\u2019 to truncate the basis when(\u2211N\nj=1m\n2\nij)\n)1\/2\n> n, as opposed to the usual \u2019cuboid cut-off\u2019 from the full CI scheme in which\nthe basis is truncated when mij > n. The total number of determinants in our expansion at a\ngiven maximum quantum number, M(n), depends on the truncation scheme, and we compare\nthe convergence of the ground state energy in each of these two schemes in section 4.\n4. Results and discussion\nIn Ref. [1] we found that the correlation was large in the majority of NT dots, and that all\n2-electron states were Wigner molecule-like when m\n\u2217\nh\u00af2\n(\n(\u03c1\/\u000fr)2\nh\u00af\u03c9\n)\n\u2265 2.8. In this work, we therefore\nfocus on a typical strongly correlated SNT dot (h\u00af\u03c9 = 5 meV, \u000fr = 2.0) and we examine the\n3 and 4 electron states. We choose a 35,0 nanotube with R = 1.37 nm and m\u2217 = 0.034 as\nthis is the type of tube studied experimentally in Ref. [2]. However, within the effective mass\napproximation, the details of the chirality are unimportant and our results will be similar for\nany SNT with similar R and m\u2217. In the 35,0 NT dot the N -electron ground state energies, EN ,\n(converged to within 0.1 meV) are E3 = 76.4 meV and E4 = 145.1 meV. Fig. 1 shows the 3 and\n4 electron density as a function of z. The states are clearly Wigner molecule-like with a strong\npeak in the density corresponding to each electron: each electron is almost localised on its own\nlattice site and the probability of tunnelling between lattice sites is small.\nTo investigate the convergence of the 3 and 4-electron ground state energy and to compare\nthe \u2019spherical\u2019 and \u2019cuboid\u2019 schemes for truncating the basis set we calculate EN as a function\nof n, the maximum single particle quantum number that we include in our basis set. We assume\n00.02\n0.04\n-100 -50 0 50 100\n0\n0.02\n0.04\nd e\nn s\ni t y\n ( 1\n\/ n m\n)\nz (nm)\nFigure 1.

Bottom: 4 electron\nnumber density.\nthat the lowest energy we obtain in our calculations (using the largest number of basis states,\nMmax) is converged. Then \u2206EN = EN (M(n))\u2212EN (Mmax) gives a measure of the convergence\nof the ground state energy for each n.\nIn Fig. 2 we plot \u2206EN as a function of M(n). It is immediately clear that a large number\nof determinants are needed to give an accurate value for EN and this is another indication that\nthe electron correlation in SNT dots is important. For example, to converge the ground state\nenergies to within 0.1 meV we need roughly M = 150 Slater determinants for 3 electrons and\nabout M = 3000 for 4 electrons. It is also apparent that truncating the CI basis with the\n0.001\n0.01\n0.1\n1\n10\n100\n 0  100  200  300  400  500  600  700\n\u2206\nE 3\n \n( m\ne V\n)\nM(n)\nspherical cut off\ncuboid cut off\n0.01\n0.1\n1\n10\n100\n 0  2000  4000  6000  8000  10000\n\u2206\nE 4\n \n( m\ne V\n)\nM(n)\nspherical cut off\ncuboid cut off\nFigure 2. Convergence of the N -electron ground state energy as a function of the number of Slater\ndeterminants in the expansion. Left: 3 electrons. Right: 4 electrons. Each point indicates a different\nvalue of n in the calculation.\nspherical cut off gives an advantage over the full CI method, and this advantage increases with\nincreasing N . For example, to obtain \u2206EN = 0.1 meV with 3 electrons we need M = 124 Slater\ndeterminants with the spherical cut-off and M = 164 with the cuboid cut off. So, using the\nspherical cut off reduces the computer time by a factor of roughly (124\/164)3 = 0.57. Similarly,\nfor 4-electrons the calculation time is reduced by a factor (1815\/2568)3 = 0.35.\nIn conclusion, we have outlined our effective mass description of the N -electron states in SNT\nquantum dots and demonstrated that many Slater determinants are needed in an expansion of\nthe states to get accurate ground state energies. Also, significant advantages can be obtained\nusing a \u2019spherical\u2019 quantum number cut off to truncate the basis set.\nReferences\n[1] Roy M and Maksym P A 2009 EPL 86 37001\n[2] Jarillo-Herrero P, Sapmaz S, Dekker C, Kouwenhoven L P and van der Zant H S J 2004 Nature 429 389\n[3] Roy M and Maksym P A 2008 Physica E 40, 1616\n[4] Secchi A and Rontani M 2009 Phys.
