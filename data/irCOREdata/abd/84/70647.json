Previous studies of oculomotor dysfunction in schizophrenia have tended to concentrate on abnormalities of smooth pursuit eye tracking in chronic medicated patients. We report the results of a study of smooth pursuit, re\u00afexive and antisaccade performance in drug naive and antipsychotic treated \u00aerst-episode schizophrenic patients. Methods. Smooth pursuit and saccadic eye movements were recorded in 36 \u00aerst-episode schizophrenic patients and 36 controls matched for age and estimated IQ. The schizophrenic patients were divided into drug-naive (N\u00af17) and antipsychotic treated groups (N\u00af19). Results. Smooth pursuit velocity gain was signi\u00aecantly lower than controls only in the drug-naive patients. The treated patients did not differ signi\u00aecantly from either the controls or the untreated group. In an antisaccade paradigm both treated and drug-naive schizophrenic patients demonstrated an increased number of errors, but only drug-naive patients also demonstrated an increased latency in initiating correct antisaccades.

Previous studies of oculomotor dysfunction in schizophrenia have tended to\nconcentrate on abnormalities of smooth pursuit eye tracking in chronic medicated patients. We\nreport the results of a study of smooth pursuit, reflexive and antisaccade performance in drug naive\nand antipsychotic treated first-episode schizophrenic patients.\nMethods. Smooth pursuit and saccadic eye movements were recorded in 36 first-episode\nschizophrenic patients and 36 controls matched for age and estimated IQ. The schizophrenic\npatients were divided into drug-naive (N\u00af 17) and antipsychotic treated groups (N\u00af 19).\nResults. Smooth pursuit velocity gain was significantly lower than controls only in the drug-naive\npatients. The treated patients did not differ significantly from either the controls or the untreated\ngroup. In an antisaccade paradigm both treated and drug-naive schizophrenic patients demonstrated\nan increased number of errors, but only drug-naive patients also demonstrated an increased latency\nin initiating correct antisaccades.\nConclusions. These impairments are unlikely to be due to a generalized deficit in oculomotor\nfunction in the schizophrenic groups, as there were no differences between the groups in saccadic\nmetrics on a reflexive saccade task. The results show that both smooth pursuit and saccadic\nabnormalities are present at the onset of schizophrenia and are integral to the disorder.\nINTRODUCTION\nOculomotor abnormalities, particularly smooth\npursuit eye tracking, are one of the most widely\nstudied \u2018biological markers \u2019 of schizophrenia\n(see Levy, 1994). However, several factors have\nlimited the utility of this research. Many early\nstudies used relatively insensitive electro-\noculographic recording techniques and relied on\nsubjective qualitative measures to rate smooth\npursuit performance. Another problem stems\nfrom inconsistencies in methods of analysing\nand measuring smooth pursuit performance,\nmaking cross study comparison difficult. Finally,\n\" Address for correspondence: Dr S. B. Hutton, Mental Health\nUnit, The Rookery, Queen Mary\u2019s University Hospital, Roehampton\nLane, London SW15 5PN.\nmost studies have been performed in chronic,\nmedicated schizophrenic populations. It is,\ntherefore, possible that such oculomotor ab-\nnormalities may reflect either neurodegenerative\nbrain changes due to chronicity of illness, since\noculomotor abnormalities are witnessed in\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease (Fletcher & Sharpe, 1988)\nand even healthy aged subjects (Moschner &\nBaloh, 1994), or the effect of medication-related\nchronic dopaminergic blockade as patients with\nParkinson\u2019s disease also have deficits in smooth\npursuit and saccadic eye movements (Crawford\net al. 1989; Waterston et al. 1996). Indeed, some\nrecent evidence, with healthy volunteers, sug-\ngests that smooth pursuit performance may be\nadversely influenced by antipsychotic med-\nications (King, 1994; Malaspina et al. 1994).\n685\n686 S. B. Hutton and others\nThere are relatively few investigations meas-\nuring saccadic performance in schizophrenic\npatients. However, there are several reasons why\nit might be important to study these in addition\nto smooth pursuit. First, both systems work\ntogether closely and interactively during normal\npursuit eye movements. Secondly, the neuro-\nlogical pathways involved in generating saccades\nin humans are better understood than those\ninvolved in generating smooth pursuit eye\nmovements. Thirdly, the basic saccadic metrics\n(latency, gain, velocity, direction and final eye\nposition) are measured using standard pro-\ncedures, allowing meaningful cross study com-\nparisons. Fourthly, saccadic paradigms also\nhave the advantage of allowing various atten-\ntional, perceptual and cognitive processes to be\nselectively engaged (Henderson et al. 1996).\nFinally, a number of recent studies have iden-\ntified abnormalities of saccadic eye movements\nin schizophrenic patients, particularly in the\nantisaccade task in which subjects are required\nto make a saccade to a position directly opposite\nthe target location (Fukushima et al. 1990;\nCrawford et al. 1995a, b ; Sereno & Holzman,\n1995).\nIn order to avoid possible contaminating\neffects of medications and illness duration some\nprevious studies have examined smooth pursuit\nperformance in first-episode schizophrenic\npatients (Sweeney et al. 1992; Lieberman et al.\n1993; Gooding et al. 1994; Maruff et al. 1995).\nThese have established that smooth pursuit\nabnormalities can be observed at presentation.\nHowever, differences in the treatment status of\nthe patients, comparison groups and measure-\nment techniques again make conclusions as to\nthe exact nature of the deficit difficult to reach.\nFurthermore, there are no published studies of\nsaccadic eye movements in first-episode schizo-\nphrenic patients.\nWe, therefore, investigated both smooth pur-\nsuit and saccadic eye movements in patients\nwith first-episode schizophrenia in order to\nexamine whether these are fundamental to the\ndisorder. To examine the effect of antipsychotic\nmedication on eye movements, we compared\nnever medicated first-episode patients, with first-\nepisode patients who have received medication\nfor a short period of time. We use standardized\nmeasures and a comprehensive test of smooth\npursuit (Crawford et al. 1995c) as well as two\ntests of saccadic performance \u2013 the reflexive, or\nprosaccade task and the antisaccade task.\nMETHOD\nSubjects\nAll patients presenting to two NHS Trusts in\nWest London with a first-episode psychotic\nillness were approached for entry into the study.\nThose who agreed to participate were assessed\nby a psychiatrist. Only those who fulfilled\nDSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia or schizo-\nphreniform disorder were included in the study.\nDuring the first year of study 36 patients\nunderwent oculomotor testing and their data is\npresented here. Seventeen of the patients were\ncompletely drug-naive at the time of testing. The\nremaining 19 subjects had received antipsychotic\nmedication for between 2 and 60 days prior to\ntesting. The medicated group were taking a\nvariety of antipsychotic drugs as the consultants\nresponsible for the patients treated them ac-\ncording to their usual practice and were not\nconstrained in their choice of antipsychotic by\nthe study protocol. All patients provided written\ninformed consent. The 36 control subjects were\nhealthy volunteers living in the same community\nwho had no history of psychiatric or neurological\ndisorders in themselves and in their first-degree\nrelatives. The control subjects also denied any\nhistory of alcohol or drug abuse. A problem\nwith the recording equipment during one session\nlead to the results of one control subject being\nlost. The characteristics of the two groups are\nsummarized in Table 1. The groups were\nmatched for sex ratio, age and estimated\npre-morbid IQ (NART; Nelson, 1982).\nApparatus\nFor saccadic paradigms the target display\nconsisted of four red light-emitting diode (LED)\ntargets (diameter 0\u00b125\u00b0) located \u00b37\u00b15\u00b0 and \u00b315\u00b0\neither side of a central fixation LED. The LED\nTable 1.

The\nsmooth pursuit stimulus was a bright red laser\nspot back projected onto the same translucent\nscreen. The target oscillated horizontally with a\ntriangular waveform of amplitude 22\u00b15\u00b0.\nSubjects were comfortably seated 1\u00b15 m from\nthe screen with a buzzer located behind their\nhead. Head movements were restrained using an\nadjustable head rest. All paradigms were con-\nducted in the dark. Eye movements were\nrecorded using a Skalar IRIS infrared limbus\nreflection device. A hardware anti-aliasing filter\n(cut-off frequency 200 Hz) was used to filter eye\nposition and the sampling rate was 500 Hz.\nStimulus display and data sampling were con-\ntrolled by a PDP 11}73 computer. Each para-\ndigm was preceded by a calibration trial in\nwhich nine equally spaced LED targets with\nknown horizontal positions were illuminated\nsequentially, the subject being asked to fixate\neach target in turn.\nProcedures\nReflexive paradigm\nEach trial consisted of the following sequence:\n(1) a central fixation LED was illuminated at the\nbeginning of each trial ; (2) after 800 ms the\nfixation LED was extinguished and simul-\ntaneously a peripheral target LED was illumin-\nated for 1000 ms and a 200 ms buzzer signal was\ninitiated. Subjects were asked to direct their gaze\nas quickly and as accurately as possible to the\nnewly illuminated target LED and then return\nto the central fixation point. The order of targets\nwas varied pseudo-randomly to prevent pre-\ndictive behaviour. There were 24 trials in all.\nAntisaccade paradigm\nThe stimuli and procedure are identical to the\nreflexive paradigm. However, the subjects are\ninstructed to move their eyes rapidly towards a\nposition in space equally distant, but in the\nopposite direction to the peripheral stimulus, i.e.\nto the mirror image location. An antisaccade\nerror occurs when the subject is \u2018distracted\u2019 by\nthe target appearing and makes a brief reflexive\nsaccade towards it. Subjects typically then make\na correct antisaccade in the opposite direction.\nSubjects performed 24 trials.\nIn both saccadic paradigms the spatial ac-\ncuracy or gain (saccadic amplitude divided by\ntarget amplitude), peak velocity and latency of\nthe primary saccade were measured, as well as\nthe final eye position (FEP). In addition, the\nnumber of antisaccade errors made by all groups\nwere recorded.\nSmooth pursuit\nThe target oscillated horizontally with a tri-\nangular waveform of amplitude 22\u00b15\u00b0. Four\nvelocities : 10, 20, 30 and 36\u00b0}sec were used, and\nsix full cycles recorded at each velocity.\nData analysis\nSaccadic analysis was conducted off-line using\ninteractive software which enabled the rejection\nof artefacts such as blinks. Eye position data\nwas filtered using a Kaiser window low-pass\nfilter. The signal was then differentiated to yield\neye velocity. Saccadic detection was based on a\nvelocity criterion of 30\u00b0}s in addition to an\nacceleration across three consecutive samples.\nFinal eye position was measured by taking the\nmean fixation location during the maximal\nperiod of fixation stability after all corrected\nsaccades were completed.\nThere is considerable controversy surrounding\nthe various ways in which smooth pursuit\nperformance can be quantified (Abel & Ziegler,\n1988; Friedman et al. 1995). The main function\nof the pursuit system is to match the velocity of\nthe eyes to that of a moving target. Accordingly,\nwe agree with Stuve et al. (1997), that the best\nassessment of the ability of the smooth pursuit\nsystem to perform this task is reflected by the\nmeasurement of the ratio of peak eye velocity\nover target velocity, known as peak velocity\ngain.\nSmooth pursuit analysis was performed using\nthe Eyemap analysis package (Amtech GmbH,\nHeidelberg). Saccadicmovementswere identified\nand excluded from the analysis. In each half\ncycle the portion of smooth pursuit eye move-\nment having the highest velocity was identified\nand expressed as peak velocity gain (eye\nvelocity}target velocity). This portion was\nalways collected from the middle third of each\nhalf cycle, to avoid acceleration and deceleration\ntransients at the beginning and end of each\nramp. Data from leftwards and rightwards\nmovement were kept separate, thus six velocity\nvalues were obtained at each target velocity for\neach direction of movement. For each subject\n688 S. B. Hutton and others\nthe degree of asymmetry between leftwards (L)\nand rightwards (R) was quantified as an asym-\nmetry factor (A) defined as\nA\u00af\ngain(R)\u00aegain(L)\ngain(R)\u00adgain(L)\n.\nThis factor ranges between \u00ae1 and \u00ad1 with a\nvalue of zero indicating no directional pref-\nerence.\nStatistical analyses\nWithin each measure, outlying data points were\nidentified and removed. Outliers were defined as\nvalues either above or below values 1\u00b15 times the\ninterquartile range from the upper and lower\nlimits of that range (the 75th and 25th percentile\nscores). This procedure resulted in the removal\nof the anti-saccade error data of two control\nsubjects, the antisaccade latency data of two\ncontrols and one drug-naive patient, the anti-\nsaccade gain data of one control, the reflexive\nsaccade latency data of two patients and one\ncontrol, and the smooth pursuit data of one\npatient. Data were analysed with analysis of\nvariance (ANOVA). Where a significant main\neffect of group occurred, planned comparisons\nwere performed. All analyses were repeated with\nthe outliers included and all significant effects\nremained.\nRESULTS\nReflexive saccades\nThe metrics for the reflexive saccade task are\ndisplayed in Table 2. There were no significant\ndifferences between any of the three groups on\nprimary saccade gain (F(2, 68)\u00af 1\u00b14, P\" 0\u00b15),\nfinal eye position (F(2, 68)\u00af 0\u00b1956, P\" 0\u00b15) or\nlatency (F(2, 65)\u00af 0\u00b114, P\" 0\u00b15).\nAntisaccades\nThe groups differed in the number of antisaccade\nerrors (F(2, 66\u00af 13\u00b198, P! 0\u00b1001) (Fig. 1).\nPlanned comparisons revealed that both the\nTable 2.

Drug-treated schizo-\nphrenics made less errors than drug-naive\npatients, but the difference was not significant\n(t(34)\u00af\u00ae1\u00b153, P\u00af 0\u00b114). The great majority of\nincorrect reflexive saccades (88\u00b15%) were sub-\nsequently corrected with antisaccades by the\nschizophrenic patients.\nThe metrics for correct trials are displayed in\nTable 3. A significant effect of group was\nobserved for primary saccade gain (F(2, 67)\u00af\n3\u00b184, P! 0\u00b105). The gain of the primary saccade\nwas lower in the treated group than in the\ncontrols (t(51)\u00af 2\u00b197, P! 0\u00b101). The difference\nbetween the controls and the untreated group,\nand the untreated group and the treated group\nwere not significant (t(49)\u00af 1\u00b144, P\u00af 0\u00b116 and\nt(34)\u00af 0\u00b193, P\u00af 0\u00b136).

Analysis\nof variance (ANOVA) revealed a main effect of\ntarget speed (F(3, 201)\u00af 130\u00b121, P! 0\u00b101) and\na main effect of group (F(2, 67)\u00af 4\u00b154,P!\n0\u00b105). The interaction was not significant\n(F(6, 201)\u00af 0\u00b149). Gain was averaged across\ntarget speeds and planned comparisons revealed\nthat the drug-naive group had a significantly\nlower overall velocity gain than controls\n(t(49)\u00af\u00ae3\u00b106, P! 0\u00b101). The gain of the drug-\ntreated group was not significantly different\nfrom either the controls (t(51)\u00af\u00ae1\u00b184, P\u00af\n0\u00b107) or from the drug-naive schizophrenics\n(t(32)\u00af 1\u00b171, P\u00af 0\u00b125).\nThere were no differences between the groups\nin the asymmetry factor (F(2, 68)\u00af 1\u00b189, P\u00af\n0\u00b116) with all groups showing very low mean\nvalues (0\u00b1032, 0\u00b1041 and 0\u00b1016 for the con-\ntrols, drug-naive and drug-treated groups\nrespectively).\nRelationship between measures of oculomotor\nperformance\nPrevious studies have demonstrated a relation-\nship between smooth pursuit performance and\nantisaccade error rate (Sereno & Holzman, 1995;\nMatsue et al. 1994). Accordingly, we performed\na Pearson correlation between the average\nsmooth pursuit gain and antisaccade error rate\nof the patients and controls. The drug-naive and\ndrug-treated schizophrenic patients were com-\nbined for this analysis. No significant corre-\nlations were found between these two measures\nin either the controls (r\u00af 0\u00b1189, P\u00af 0\u00b1277 or\nthe schizophrenic patients (r\u00af\u00ae0\u00b1051, P\u00af\n0\u00b1767).\nDISCUSSION\nWe examined smooth pursuit and saccadic eye\nmovements in patients with schizophrenia or\nschizophreniform disorder during their first\npsychotic episode. Both drug-naive and anti-\npsychotic-treated patients were tested. Smooth\npursuit velocity gain was significantly lower\nthan controls only in the drug-naive patients. In\nthe antisaccade paradigm both treated and drug-\nnaive schizophrenic patients demonstrated an\nincreased number of errors. Only drug-naive\npatients also demonstrated an increased latency\nin initiating correct antisaccades and only drug-\ntreated patients had reduced primary saccade\ngain compared to controls. There were no\ndifferences between the groups on any reflexive\nsaccade metrics.\nIn the reflexive saccade task, both drug-\ntreated and drug-naive patients performed nor-\nmally in that they were as quick as controls to\ninitiate an eye movement, the gain of their\nprimary saccades were not hypometric, and\ntheir final eye position was highly accurate. This\nsuggests that they were motivated and able to\ncooperate with the testing procedure. It also\nsuggests that other oculomotor abnormalities\ncannot be ascribed to either a generalized\ndysfunction of oculomotor neural systems or to\na non-specific effect of antipsychotic medication.\nIn the antisaccade paradigm, the patients\nwere, again, as accurate as controls regarding\nthe final eye position on correctly performed\ntrials, but they were impaired on other measures.\nBoth patient groups showed increased distract-\nibility by making more reflexive saccades (errors)\nthan controls. This effect was independent of\nmedication status and, importantly, 88\u00b15% of\nall incorrect reflexive saccades were subsequently\n690 S. B. Hutton and others\ncorrected, indicating that errors were not due to\na misunderstanding of the paradigm. Several\nstudies have demonstrated an increased anti-\nsaccade error rate in chronic medicated patients\n(Thaker et al. 1989; Fukushima et al. 1990;\nSereno & Holzman, 1995). Crawford et al.\n(1995a) also found this in chronic patients who\nhad not received antipsychotic medication for at\nleast 6 months. We have now extended these\nfindings and demonstrated that increased anti-\nsaccade errors can be witnessed at the onset of\nthe clinical manifestations of schizophrenia, and\ncannot be attributed to medication effects, to\nmore general problems of motivation or to a\nfailure to understand the experimental pro-\ncedure. This saccadic oculomotor deficit, there-\nfore, appears to be a fundamental abnormality\nof the disorder.\nEvidence suggests that volitional saccades are\nunder the executive control of frontal cortical\nregions, including the frontal eye fields (Bruce &\nGoldberg, 1985), the supplementary eye fields\n(Shook et al. 1990) and the dorsolateral pre-\nfrontal cortex (DLPFC, Guitton et al. 1985). In\nparticular, DLPFC (area 46) appears to be\nspecifically involved in the suppression of re-\nflexive saccades towards the target in antisaccade\ntasks (Guitton et al. 1985; Pierrot-Deseilligny et\nal. 1991). Regarding cognitive explanations of\nimpairment on antisaccade tasks, Henderson\nand colleagues (1996) suggest that the inability\nto suppress a biologically prepotent reflexive\nsaccade may reflect a primary deficit in strategic\nplanning. This explanation also agrees with\nneuropsychological and functional imaging\nstudies of the DLPFC which have shown that\nthis area is critically involved in planning and\nother strategic processing in non-oculomotor\ntasks (Baker et al. 1996; Owen et al. 1996a, b).\nThere is much evidence to suggest that the\nDLPFC is especially dysfunctional in schizo-\nphrenic patients, and that this mediates their\nabnormal performance on neuropsychological\ntests of frontal lobe function such as the WCST,\nand certain clinical features (see Frith, 1992,\n1995).\nThe differences between the treated and\nuntreated groups on certain measures points to\na complex effect of antipsychotic medication on\nperformance in the antisaccade paradigm. The\ntreated patients were significantly faster than the\nuntreated patients in initiating a correct anti-\nsaccade suggesting that the medication was\nhaving a beneficial effect on performance. This\neffect may also account for the seemingly\nreduced error rate in the treated group, although\nthis failed to reach statistical significance. The\nsignificance of the decreased primary saccade\ngain in the treated group is not clear. Since FEP\nwas normal, it does not appear to reflect a deficit\nin spatial accuracy. It is interesting to note that\nprimary saccade hypometria has also been\nobserved in medicated compared to unmedicated\npatients with both chronic schizophrenia and\nmanic psychosis (Crawford et al. 1995a, b), as\nwell as in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease\n(although not on an antisaccade task, Crawford\net al. 1989). Thus, primary saccade hypometria\nmay be a reflection of antipsychotic drug effects\non dopaminergic extrapyramidal motor systems.\nOf course, factors other than medication\nmight account for the differences between the\ntreated and untreated groups, although the\ngroups were matched for age, gender and\nestimated IQ. However, to confirm whether our\nfindings are a reflection of a medication effect, or\nreflect some other group difference it will be\nnecessary to retest the drug-naive patients once\nthey have been established on medication.\nSmooth pursuit eye movements have been\nstudied much more extensively than saccadic\nperformance in schizophrenic patients. The\nconsensus opinion is that patients with chronic\nschizophrenia have an impairment of smooth\npursuit eye tracking, which is perhaps best\ncharacterized by a reduction in smooth pursuit\nvelocity gain (eye velocity divided by target\nvelocity) combined with an increase in corrective\ncatch up saccades (Mather, 1985; Levin et al.\n1988; Moser et al. 1990; Abel et al. 1991;\nFriedman et al. 1991, 1992, 1995; Litman et al.\n1994). However, much of this research has been\ncarried out on medicated patients, and there are\na number of reasons why antipsychotic medi-\ncation might be expected to effect smooth pursuit\nperformance. First, the abnormality witnessed\nin schizophrenic patients can be mimicked by\nthe administration of antipsychotics to normal\nvolunteers (King, 1994; Malaspina et al. 1994),\nalthough earlier studies have failed to show this\n(Holzman et al. 1975). Secondly, reduced gain\nhas been observed in the early stages of\nParkinson\u2019s disease (Waterston et al. 1996), in\nwhich there is a dopamine deficiency in both the\nOculomotor abnormalities in first-episode schizophrenia 691\nbasal ganglia and cortex, and it is well known\nthat neuroleptic medication can cause parkin-\nsonian symptoms in schizophrenics by blockade\nof dopamine receptors. Thirdly, in chronic\npatients, smooth pursuit is worse in those\ncurrently taking antipsychotic medication com-\npared to those who have been off medication for\nat least 6 months (Crawford et al. 1995b ;\nKufferle et al. 1990), although studies with\nshorter wash-out periods have failed to dem-\nonstrate this (Siever et al. 1986; Spohn et al.\n1988).\nTwo previous studies have therefore examined\nsmooth pursuit in drug-naive patients. Campion\net al. (1992) were the first to show that drug-\nnaive patients were as equally impaired as\nmedicated patients. Subsequently, Sweeney and\ncolleagues (1994) demonstrated that drug-naive\nand drug-free, but previously treated groups of\nschizophrenic patients had equally reduced\nsmooth pursuit gain compared with controls\nand that there was no change in this measure\nfollowing drug therapy in either group. How-\never, the patients in this study had been ill for a\nmean of 2 years and those of Campion for a\nmean of 4 years. Studies specifically examining\nsmooth pursuit at the onset of psychosis confirm\nthe presence of reduced velocity gain, but these\nresults are confounded by the inclusion of both\ntreated and untreated patients (Sweeney et al.\n1992; Lieberman et al. 1993). The present study,\ntherefore, clarifies these issues by the dem-\nonstration that first-episode drug-naive patients\nhave reduced smooth pursuit velocity gain thus\nconfirming and extending the above findings.\nA number of cortical areas are believed to be\ninvolved in the control of smooth pursuit eye\nmovements, including the medial temporal visual\narea (MT) and medial superior temporal visual\narea (MST), the posterior parietal cortex (PPC)\nand the frontal eye fields (FEF). It is believed\nthat area MST combines the target motion\ninformation with an internally generated signal\nof eye velocity. The role of the PPC is presumed\nto be attentional, whereas the FEF may be\ninvolved in programming predictive pursuit\nmovements (MacAvoy et al. 1991; Morrow &\nSharpe, 1995). The frontal eye fields are also\nbelieved to be important in antisaccade per-\nformance (Rivaud et al. 1994; Pierrot-\nDeseilligny et al. 1995). Previous research has\nfound that subjects with poor pursuit tracking\nalso make more antisaccade errors (Matsue et\nal. 1994; Sereno & Holzman, 1995). These\nfindings have been used as further evidence for\nthe contention that schizophrenia is a \u2018 frontal \u2019\nimpairment. However, in our study no such\nrelationship between performance on the two\ntasks was observed, a result consistent with\nGooding et al. (1997). These findings, therefore,\nimply that schizophrenic patients are failing the\ntasks for different reasons and that different\npathophysiological mechanisms may underlie\nthe impairment on these two types of task. We\nare currently conducting research aimed at\nfurther exploring different cognitive deficits\nwhich may contribute to low smooth pursuit\nvelocity gain and increased antisaccade error\nrate in schizophrenic patients.\nThis study was supported by Wellcome grant number\n042025.\nREFERENCES\nAbel, L.
