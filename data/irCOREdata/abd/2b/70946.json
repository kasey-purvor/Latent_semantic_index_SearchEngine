The function of these ACE-like proteins is largely\nunknown. Sequencing of the A. gambiae genome has revealed a number of ACE-like genes but\nprobable errors in the Ensembl annotation have left the number of ACE-like genes, and their\nstructure, unclear.\nResults: TBLASTN and sequence analysis of cDNAs revealed that the A. gambiae genome contains\nnine genes (AnoACE genes) which code for proteins with similarity to mammalian ACE. Eight of\nthese genes code for putative single domain enzymes similar to other insect ACEs described so far.\nAnoACE9, however, has several features in common with mammalian somatic ACE such as a two\ndomain structure and a hydrophobic C terminus. Four of the AnoACE genes (2, 3, 7 and 9) were\nshown to be expressed at a variety of developmental stages. Expression of AnoACE3, AnoACE7 and\nAnoACE9 is induced by a blood meal, with AnoACE7 showing the largest (approximately 10-fold)\ninduction.\nConclusion: Genes coding for two-domain ACEs have arisen several times during the course of\nevolution suggesting a common selective advantage to having an ACE with two active-sites in\ntandem in a single protein. AnoACE7 belongs to a sub-group of insect ACEs which are likely to be\nmembrane-bound and which have an unusual, conserved gene structure.\nBackground\nIn mammals, angiotensin-converting enzyme (EC\n3.4.15.1, ACE, peptidyl-dipeptidase A), an important\nmember of the M2 peptidase family, is found on the sur-\nface of endothelial cells and is best known for its role in\nthe biosynthesis of angiotensin II, as well as the degrada-\ntion of circulating bradykinin and the haemoregulatory\npeptide, N-acetyl SDKP [1-3]. Mammalian ACE exists as\ntwo isoforms, a somatic form (sACE, 150\u2013180 kDa) and a\nsmaller protein (germinal ACE, 90\u2013110 kDa) found\nPublished: 05 December 2005\nBMC Genomics 2005, 6:172 doi:10.1186\/1471-2164-6-172\nReceived: 22 September 2005\nAccepted: 05 December 2005\nThis article is available from: http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/6\/172\n\u00a9 2005 Burnham et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. \nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/2.0), \nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Page 1 of 13\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Genomics 2005, 6:172 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/6\/172exclusively in adult testes. The ACE gene comprises\ntwenty-six exons and two promoters, and has clearly\narisen by gene duplication [4]. The somatic promoter\ndrives expression of the larger protein (exons 1\u201312 and\nexons 14\u201326), which consists of two very similar domains\nconnected in tandem by a short inter-domain peptide.\nEach domain possesses a functional peptidase active site\nand they are commonly called the N- and C-domains after\ntheir relative position to the amino and carboxy termini.\nThe bulk of the protein including the amino terminus is\nextracellular and is linked by a hydrophobic transmem-\nbrane sequence to a short intracellular peptide. The bio-\nlogical rationale for two catalytic units linked in tandem is\nnot known, although there is experimental evidence to\nsuggest that co-operativity exists between the two halves\nof the protein [5-7].\nIn developing spermatids, an alternative intragenic pro-\nmoter utilises exons 13\u201326 and generates a single domain\nACE (gACE) which is largely identical to the C-terminal\ndomain of somatic ACE [4,8]. Male mice lacking gACE are\ninfertile as a result of sperm that are defective in migration\nin the oviduct and in binding to the zona pellucida [9].\nInsect ACE has broad substrate specificity and its presence\nin the haemolymph of insects raises the possibility that,\nlike mammalian sACE, it is required for extracellular\nmetabolism of peptide hormones [10,11]. Drosophila mel-\nanogaster has six ACE-like genes (Ance, Acer, Ance-2, Ance-\n3, Ance-4 and Ance-5), all coding for single domain pro-\nteins. The ANCE protein has been relatively well charac-\nterised and has been shown to have several biochemical\nsimilarities to the mammalian enzyme. Its activity is\ndevelopmentally regulated, with highest levels during\nmetamorphosis [12,13]. ANCE is also expressed in sper-\nmatocytes and appears to have an important role in sper-\nmiogenesis [14]. Of the other Drosophila ACEs, only the\nAcer gene product has been studied biochemically and it\nis likely that ANCE-2, ANCE-3, ANCE-4 and ANCE-5 do\nnot function as peptidases since they lack one or more of\nthe residues that are essential for peptidase activity [15].\nACER, like ANCE and human ACE, is a peptidyl dipepti-\ndase, but is generally less efficient than ANCE at cleaving\ndipeptides from many oligopeptide substrates [16]. Acer is\nexpressed in the embryonic heart [17] and in both the\nmale and female gonads and brain of adult flies (A.\nCarhan, R. E. Isaac and A. D. Shirras, unpublished results)\nwhere it is assumed to have a role in the metabolism of, as\nyet unidentified, biologically active peptides involved in\nneuroendocrine signalling and reproduction.\nACE activity has been found in the gonads and accessory\nglands of several insect species in addition to D. mela-\nnogaster, suggesting a conserved role for this enzyme in\ninsect reproduction [10,11]. Recently, we have provided\nevidence for a role for ACE in reproduction in the mos-\nquito, A. stephensi. ACE activity in the adult female mos-\nquito increases by 260% following a blood meal [10,18]\nand it has been proposed that the induced ACE has a role\nin regulating peptide signalling in response to a blood\nmeal. We have shown that feeding two different ACE\ninhibitors to male A. stephensi in their glucose diet,\nresulted in approx. 80% reduction in the number of eggs\nlaid [10]. In addition, ACE inhibitors introduced in the\nblood meal, resulted in a dose-dependent effect on brood-\nsize, but had no effect on oocyte development, nor the\nrate of digestion of the blood. The only observable differ-\nence between inhibitor-fed and control insects was that\nthe inhibitor-fed females could not lay eggs, even 8 days\nafter the blood meal, suggesting that the blood-induced\nACE is involved in the control of egg-laying [19].\nTo understand the mechanism of ACE induction in\nblood-fed mosquitoes and the role of the enzyme in mos-\nquito reproductive physiology, we have characterised the\nACE gene family in Anopheles gambiae, a mosquito respon-\nAnnotation of ACE-like genes in the 35C clusterFigure 1\nAnnotation of ACE-like genes in the 35C cluster.

The\npartially annotated A gambiae genome [21] reveals\nbetween eight and twelve potential ACE-like genes. We\nnow report the correct number of A. gambiae ACE\n(AnoACE) genes, confirm their corresponding protein\nsequences and establish their expression patterns during\ndevelopment and in response to a blood meal. We show\nthat several of the AnoACEs are similar to other insect\nACEs, but that AnoACE9 is a novel two-domain ACE\nwhose structure resembles that of human somatic ACE.\nResults\nACE-like genes in the A. gambiae genome\nThe Ensembl annotation of the A. gambiae genome (ver-\nsion 34.2 g) [21] suggests that there are eight genes encod-\ning proteins belonging to the M2 (ACE) family of\npeptidases. BLAST searching of the genome and an exam-\nination of the predicted genes, however, shows that not all\nACE-like proteins have been predicted, while several of\nthose that have been identified have missing exons, or are\nhybrids, composed of exons from more than one ACE-like\ngene. These problems are particularly acute for a cluster of\nACE-like sequences at 35C on chromosome 3R (Fig. 1). In\norder to confirm the number and organisation of ACE-like\ngenes in the A. gambiae genome a combination of\nTBLASTN analysis [21], using Drosophila melanogaster ACE\nproteins as query sequences, and cDNA sequence analysis\nwas carried out. Results are summarised in Tables 2 and 3\nand may be viewed as a custom track in Ensembl Mos-\nquito [37].\nTBLASTN analysis revealed 11 possible ACE-like coding\nsequences. Six of these sequences are arranged in a tightly\nlinked tandem cluster at 35C (Figs. 1 &2). These were\nnumbered (from 5' to 3') AnoACE 2,3,4,5,6 and 7. Several\nEST clones exist for AnoACE2 and AnoACE3, allowing the\nexons of these genes, and their coding regions to be unam-\nbiguously assigned. AnoACE3 has two alternative tran-\nscripts which differ in their first exon. No cDNA clones are\navailable for AnoACEs 4, 5 and 6. The exons of these genes\nwere identified by BLAST similarity and the SNAP exon\npredictions of Ensembl [21]. The nucleotide sequences of\nAnoACEs 5 and 6 are 97% identical, including the introns,\nwhich raised the possibility that these two genes are the\nresult of a sequence assembly error caused by nucleotide\npolymorphisms in the PEST strain. This high level of iden-\ntity is only observed within the putative transcribed\nregion, however. The upstream flanking sequence of\nAnoACE6 shares only around 75% identity with the\nAnoACE5 upstream DNA and there is no significant simi-\nlarity between the downstream flanking sequences of the\ntwo genes. An assembly error can therefore be ruled out.\nThe AnoACE7 gene has an unusual organisation; there are\neight upstream exons situated at the 3' end of the 35C\ncluster which encode the bulk of the protein and there are\ntwo exons encoding the C terminus of the protein 69 kb\nTable 2: ACE-like genes in the A. gambiae genome.

Other than AnoACEs 2,3,7 and 9, expression\nlevels were as for no template controls. Transcription of\nAnoACE3, AnoACE7 and AnoACE9 was shown to be up-\nregulated 48 hours following a blood meal (Fig. 8). The\nincrease in transcription was consistent for three separate\ncohorts of female mosquitoes.\nDiscussion\nOur analysis of the A. gambiae genome has revealed nine\nACE-like genes. This is the largest number of ACE genes\nfor any species with a complete genome sequence. Dro-\nsophila melanogaster has six ACE-like genes [15], but only\ntwo of these (Ance and Acer) are known to code for active\npeptidase proteins. As well as having the ACE-like genes\nfound in D. melanogaster, D. pseudoobscura has an addi-\ntional Ance-like gene which is likely to code for an active\npeptidase, since all the amino acids that are necessary for\ncatalysis and coordination with the active site zinc are\nconserved (A.D. Shirras, unpublished work). Apis mellifera\nhas three ACE-like genes, each with a full complement of\nthe critical active site amino acids [24]. At present we have\nevidence that at least four AnoACE genes (2, 3, 7 and 9) are\nexpressed, but have no evidence for expression of\nAnoACEs 1, 4, 5, 6 and 8. All of the AnoACE genes, how-\nRT-PCR analysis of AnoACE gene expressionFigure 7\nRT-PCR analysis of AnoACE gene expression.

The cluster at 35C contains five genes\nthat are closely related in sequence. Two of these\n(AnoACE5 and AnoACE6) are almost identical. Similar\nclusters of other duplicated genes exist within the A. gam-\nbiae genome; for example there is a cluster of M14 carbox-\nypeptidase genes at 29D which contains adjacent genes\nwith greater than 90% identity. In both these clusters the\nhigh levels of identity are restricted to the transcribed\nregions with flanking DNA showing lower levels of simi-\nlarity. This suggests that selective pressures are maintain-\ning the nucleotide sequences of these genes and that they\nare expressed at some stage.\nComparison of ACE protein sequences (Fig. 5) suggests\nthat there are three functional groupings in insects. The\nfirst contains Drosophila ANCE, AnoACEs 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6\nand several other insect ACEs. These are single domain,\nsecreted enzymes. This class of ACE proteins is similar to\nthe chordate N and C domains, both in terms of sequence\nand enzyme activity. The second group includes\nAnoACE7, Drosophila ANCE-3 and Apis 3929. These pro-\nteins are single domain, but have extended N termini. The\nDrosophila and mosquito proteins have a hydrophobic C\nterminus suggesting that they may be membrane-teth-\nered. The active sites of these three proteins are character-\nised by an alanine in place of glycine at position 4 of the\nHExxH motif (Fig. 4). AnoACE8 and Apis 10228 form\ndiverged members of this group.\nThe third group of insect ACEs, containing AnoACE1 and\nDrosophila ANCE-2, -4 and -5, is highly divergent. These\nappear to be secreted proteins and, whereas AnoACE1\nmay be enzymically active, the Drosophila examples lack\nessential active site amino acids. C. elegans ACN-1 and ver-\ntebrate ACE2 proteins form highly diverged members of\nthis family. This result is to be expected as they have dis-\ntinctive and highly evolved roles in these animals [25,11].\nAnoACE9 is highly unusual. Phylogenetic analyses using\nseveral different tree construction methods (Neighbour-\nJoining, Maximum Parsimony, Minimum Evolution,\nUnweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean)\ndo not place it convincingly in any of the insect groups\ndescribed above. In terms of overall structure it is more\nsimilar to mammalian somatic ACE than to any inverte-\nbrate ACE described so far (Fig. 6). It has two active site\ndomains and has a hydrophobic C terminus. This similar-\nity with vertebrate ACEs is, as far as we know, unique\namongst non-chordate invertebrates. It is likely that\nAnoACE9 is membrane bound, either by virtue of its\nhydrophobic C-terminus or via a potential GPI anchor. In\nmammals, membrane sACE can be released from the\nplasma membrane by unidentified metalloproteases,\nknown as secretases or sheddases, that cleave the Arg-Ser\nbond in the Ala-Arg-Ser-Glu motif of the juxtamembrane\nstalk [26,27]. Interestingly, a similar peptide sequence\n(Leu-Arg-Ser-Asp) is found in the same position in the\nproposed juxtamembrane stalk of AnoACE9 (Fig. 6),\nwhich might serve as a cleavage site for a mosquito ACE\nsecretase.\nIn mammals, the two active sites of sACE are involved in\nthe conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II and the\nhydrolysis of bradykinin, but only the N-domain is\ninvolved in N-acetyl SDKP metabolism [2]. Thus, duplica-\ntion appears to have provided an opportunity for the N-\ndomain to acquire distinctive substrate specificity. How-\never, this does not explain why mammalian sACE is a sin-\ngle protein with two catalytic domains joined by a peptide\nlinker, rather than single genes encoding single domain\nproteins as occurs in D. melanogaster. Our phylogenetic\nanalysis indicates that the gene duplication event leading\nto the two-domain vertebrate somatic ACE, occurred\naround 450 million years ago, before the divergence of\namphibians and fishes, and that two other very similar\nevents occurred independently to give rise to a two-\ndomain enzyme: one in the lineage leading to A. gambiae\nand one in the urochordate lineage leading to Ciona intes-\ntinalis (Fig. 5). That is, two-domain ACE proteins have\nbeen selected for on three separate occasions, suggesting\nthat there is a distinct functional advantage to having two\nRelative expression of AnoACE genes in glucose and blood-fed femalesFigure 8\nRelative expression of AnoACE genes in glucose and \nblood-fed females.

Support for this hypothesis comes from\nseveral studies on mammalian sACE that suggest that the\ntwo active sites can have cooperative effects on ACE activ-\nity [5-7]. Recent studies indicate that the N-domain of\nhuman somatic ACE also has a negative effect on the shed-\nding of the protein from the cell surface by cleavage\nwithin the stalk region that separates the C-domain from\nthe membrane anchor [28]. More detailed biochemical\nstudies on AnoACE9 are now required to determine\nwhether similar cooperative phenomena occur in mos-\nquitoes.\nThe expression of AnoACEs 3, 7 and 9 is induced by a\nblood meal. Two of these genes (AnoACE 3 and 7) are\ninduced more than ten-fold. Neuropeptides are known to\nbe important for mediating several behavioural and phys-\niological responses to a blood meal in mosquitoes [29-\n34]. Our previous work showing that ACE inhibitors\nblock egg-laying, but not egg development, in blood fed\nA. stephensi [19] led us to propose that the elevated pepti-\ndase activity might be important for regulating a peptide\nsignal involved in egg-laying. The up-regulation of\nAnoACEs 3, 7 and 9 following a blood meal in A. gambiae,\nraises the possibility that ACE may also be involved in reg-\nulating post feeding oviposition in this species.\nA role for at least some AnoACEs in the immune response\nis suggested by recent microarray data [35]. AnoACE7\n(ENSANGT00000022325) was shown to be 2.4-fold\nupregulated by challenge with Salmonella typhimurium.\nAnoACE1 (ENSANGT0000010993) was 3.5-fold upregu-\nlated by Staphylococcus aureus infection, whereas the\nexpression of AnoACE9 (ENSANGT00000028617) was\nreduced 2.4-fold by Beauveria bassiana. We were unable to\ndetect AnoACE1 expression in a variety of developmental\nstages. However, the expression of this gene suggested by\nthe infection microarray may mean that this gene plays a\nspecific role as a component of the immune response.\nConclusion\nThe Anopheles gambiae genome contains 9 genes coding\nfor proteins with similarity to mammalian ACE. Six of\nthese genes are found in a tandem cluster situated at 35C\non chromosome 3R. Five of the members of this cluster\ncode for proteins which are similar to previously\ndescribed insect ACEs: they contain a single active site\ndomain and lack a C-terminal hydrophobic region.\nAnoACE7, situated at the 3' end of the 35C cluster, is an\northologue of Drosophila Ance-3 and of Apis gene\nENSAPMG00000014390. In all three species, there is a\nsimilar gene structure with the bulk of the coding exons\nseparated from the C-terminal exons by a large intron\nwhich contains other genes. The AnoACE7 protein, like\nDrosophila ANCE-3, has a hydrophobic C-terminus and is\nlikely to be membrane bound. AnoACEs 8 and 10 are also\npredicted to be single domain proteins but AnoACE9 is\nunique amongst insect ACEs described so far in that it\ncontains two active site domains and has a hydrophobic\nC-terminus, a structure similar to that of mammalian\nsomatic ACE. Expression of only 4 of the Anopheles ACE\ngenes (2, 3, 7 and 9) could be detected by RT-PCR in the\nstages tested. Expression of AnoACEs 3, 7 and 9 increased\nfollowing a blood meal.\nMethods\nInsects\nMale and female Anopheles gambiae were maintained at a\ntemperature of 26\u00b0C and at a relative humidity of 80 %.\nNewly hatched adult mosquitoes were fed for seven days\non sterile 5% (w\/v) glucose\/0.5% (w\/v) p-aminobenzoic\nacid solution [20]. On the seventh day female mosquitoes\nwere harvested and divided into two cohorts. Mosquitoes\nin cohort A were maintained on the glucose\/p-aminoben-\nzoic acid solution, whilst mosquitoes in cohort B were fed\nmouse blood. After the blood meal any unfed female\nmosquitoes (from cohort B) were discarded. Mosquitoes\nfrom cohort B were collected 48 hours after the blood\nmeal. Insects from cohort A were collected 48 hours after\ncohort B was given the blood meal.\nExtraction of nucleic acids\nNucleic acids were extracted using either the Qiagen\nDNeasy\u00ae or RNeasy\u00ae kits as per manufacturer's directions.\nDuring RNA extraction the optional RNase-free DNase I\nfrom Qiagen\u00ae was used to digest DNA. After quantifica-\ntion, extracted DNA was stored at 4\u00b0C and RNA at -80\u00b0C\nuntil required.\nPCR\nPrimers were designed for each possible mosquito ACE\ngene, with each pair crossing exon boundaries, where this\nwas possible (see Table 1 for primer sequences).\nThe primers were also designed so that the product size\nfrom cDNA would be approximately 100 bp as appropri-\nate for use with QPCR, except for AnoACE1 where the\nproduct was 943 bp. Amplification reactions were pre-\npared in 20 \u00b5l volumes and contained; 100 ng of tem-\nplate, 2 \u00b5l of PCR buffer (670 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.8; 166\nmM [NH4]2SO4; 67 mM MgCl2), 200 \u00b5M of dNTPs, 330\nng of BSA, 0.14 \u00b5l of 5% (v\/v) \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, 1 unit\nof Promega\u00ae Taq polymerase, 20 pmol of forward primer,\n20 pmol of reverse primer. The following cycling condi-\ntions were used: one incubation at 94\u00b0C for 5 min; 35\ncycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 s; Tm for 30 s; 74\u00b0C for 1 min: fol-\nlowed by one incubation at 74\u00b0C for 5 min (where the Tm\nis appropriate for each set of primers).Page 10 of 13\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Genomics 2005, 6:172 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/6\/172RT-PCR\nTo amplify the 5' end of AnoACE7, cDNA was prepared\nusing an Invitrogen Cloned AMV kit as per the manufac-\nturer's instructions. Using 2 \u00b5g total RNA from blood fed\nA. gambiae and 10 mM gene specific primer (ACE7 REV:\n5'-GTCTATTCGGCGCATTTGAT-3'), first strand synthesis\nwas performed at 50\u00b0C for 1 hour. PCR was then carried\nout using 1 \u00b5l of the first strand reaction, 2 mM dNTPs,\n0.5 mM each primer (ACE7 REV and ACE7 FOR3: 5'-AGT-\nGAAAACGTAACCATTGCAGAA-3') and 2.5 units Proof-\nstart enzyme (Qiagen). PCR conditions were as follows:\ninitial denaturation at 95\u00b0C, 5 min. then 35 cycles of\n95\u00b0C for 30s, 54\u00b0C for 30s, 72\u00b0C for 3 min., and a final\nextension at 72\u00b0C for 5 min. A 1.1 kb product was puri-\nfied using the Qiagen\u00ae gel purification kit as per the man-\nufacturer's instructions, cloned into pGEM\u00aeT-Easy and\nsequenced using M13 forward and reverse, and internal\nprimers. The accession number of this sequence is\n[EMBL:AM085517]. For semi-quantitative RT-PCR, first\nstrand synthesis of cDNA took place in a 20 \u00b5l reaction\nvolume using 1 \u00b5g of RNA and Promega ImPromII RT\u00ae kit\nas per the manufacturer's instructions and either random\nor gene-specific primers. PCR was carried out using the\nmethod described above with 2 \u00b5l of cDNA, primers as in\nTable 1, and the following cycling conditions: 94\u00b0C for 5\nmin. then 35 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 15 s, Tm for 15 s, 74\u00b0C for\n30 s followed by incubation at 74\u00b0C for 5 min. PCR prod-\nucts were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. To con-\nfirm identity of the PCR products, bands were purified\nusing the Qiagen\u00ae gel purification kit, cloned into pGEM\u00ae\nT-Easy and sequenced using M13 forward and reverse\nprimers.\nQuantitative RT-PCR\nRNA (3 \u00b5g) was reverse transcribed using the Promega\nImPromII\u00ae kit and the resulting cDNA quantified using a\nBiorad iCycler instrument. cDNA (5 \u00b5l) was diluted in\nwater to a total of 200 \u00b5l. Three-fold serial dilutions were\nmade from this mixture as templates for the calibration\ncurve. The remaining 15 \u00b5l of each experimental cDNA\nwas made up to 400 \u00b5l with water. Reactions were per-\nformed in duplicate using 10 \u00b5l of template, 12.5 \u00b5l of\nABsolute\u2122 QPCR SYBR\u00ae green and 2.5 \u00b5l of primers at a\nconcentration determined to be optimum for each primer\npair. Reactions were subjected to the following amplifica-\ntion cycles; 95\u00b0C for 15 min, once; 95\u00b0C for 15 s; 60\u00b0C\nfor 30 s for 40 cycles. Melt curves were also performed to\nconfirm that a single PCR product and no primer dimers\nwere produced. The melt curves were performed using the\nfollowing conditions; one incubation at 95\u00b0C for 30 s,\n55\u00b0C for 30 s, once; followed by incubation at 55\u00b0C for\n10 s 82 times, with a temperature increase of 0.5\u00b0C every\ncycle after cycle 2. Transcript levels of the AnoACE genes\nwere normalised against the levels of mRNA for the ribos-\nomal protein RPS17, amplified using primers 5'-TTGAC-\nCATGGATTTCGACAC-3' and 5'-\nTGATGGAAATACCACGCACT-3', forward and reverse,\nrespectively.\nList of abbreviations\nACE: angiotensin I-converting enzyme, AnoACE: Anophe-\nles ACE\nAuthors' contributions\nSB and AJL identified AnoACE genes and carried out\nexpression studies.
