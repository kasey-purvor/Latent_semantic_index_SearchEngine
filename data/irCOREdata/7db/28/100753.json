Such structures, termed photonic crys-\ntals \u0001PCs\u0002, provide a basic platform for molding the flow of\nlight and hold promise for a breadth of future applications.\nRecently, the ability of PCs to control the flow of light in the\nvisible regime has led to the emergence of a current realm of\nactive research, wherein the aim is to use large-scale PCs to\nrealize functional windows or displays.3\u20135 A characteristic\nexample of envisioned applications is structural color \u0001irides-\ncent, prismatic, multihued, and luminescent\u0002, which allows\nfor evading the environmentally unfriendly traditional dyes\nand is built of components which are benign, while being\nuniversally attractive in competitive marketplaces, such as\nmobile electronics and automotive or airline industries. Fur-\nther foreseeable applications include windows that can\nchange their appearance from transparent to opaque on de-\nmand, or that adapt their transmission properties to the direc-\ntion of incident light, e.g., for more efficient solar panels.6\nFor such purposes, opal-based PCs are the most promising\ncandidates since they possess three-dimensional \u00013D\u0002 photo-\nnic properties, and can simultaneously be fabricated on large\nscales and at low cost.\nA central issue toward the deployment of PCs in the\naforementioned applications is the extent to which tunability\nor even complete switching of their optical properties can be\nachieved. So far, researchers have primarily followed two\nstrategies for the accomplishment of global tuning in photo-\nnic bandgap \u0001PBG\u0002 structures. The first is, broadly, based on\nthe control of lattice constant\u0001s\u0002, either by means of me-\nchanical forces7 or by volume phase transitions,3 caused by\nexternal optical illumination or by changes in the environ-\nment. While this method does allow for large shifts in the\noptical stop band, the associated structural changes are usu-\nally on the order of micrometers, which may be a hindrance\nfor certain nanophotonic applications. The second methodol-\nogy relies on variation of the material refractive indices,\neither through free-carrier injection,8 thermo-optic\nillumination,9 or liquid-crystal infiltration.10 While large\nchanges in the reflection spectra have been observed in such\nsystems, achieving complete photonic bandgap switching\nstill remains to be shown. Moreover, the robustness of these\nmethods to geometric imperfections and the extent to which\ntheir applicability is affected by minute or sizable fabrication\ndeficiencies is not clear yet.\nIn this work, we introduce a practical scheme for achiev-\ning complete PBG switching through the collective shift of\ndielectric spheres placed within an opal-based PC. The in-\nvestigated structure, which we call double-inverse-opal pho-\ntonic crystal \u0001DIOPC\u0002 consists of an inverse opal with high-\nindex dielectric backbone and movable dielectric spheres\ninside the air pores \u0003see Fig. 1\u0001a\u0002\u0004. Such a structure has al-\nready been fabricated11 with very good homogeneity and re-\nproducibility, which allows for large-scale applications. In\nthis letter, we show that the DIOPC can possess a robust and\ncompletely switchable PBG of above 3%. Moreover, this\nswitchable PBG is independent of the size of the intercon-\nnections between the air voids, which is of great technologi-\ncal importance, since the size of the interconnections is the\nmost difficult parameter to control during the fabrication pro-\ncess. In this way, a substantial flexibility is allowed, without\nany impact on the reproducibility.\nA schematic description of the DIOPC structure is given\nin Fig. 1\u0001a\u0002. Consider an inverse opal structure of closed-\npacked air pores with radius Rp, partially filled with spherical\nparticles, and interconnected via cylindrical channels of ra-\ndius Rcyl. The background material is tin disulfide \u0001nb=3.2\u0002\nand the spheres are made of titania \u0001nsp=2.5\u0002 and have radius\nRsp. The principle of the fabrication process and experimen-\ntal demonstration of such structures have been detailed in a\nseries of recent works.11,12 Note that, for this specific choice\nof materials, the fabricated structures are transparent in most\nof the visible spectral range. The titania spheres have inor-\nganic cores that are assumed to be considerably smaller than\nthe wavelength of light. These inorganic cores can be ad-\ndressed by external electric or magnetic fields, thereby al-\nlowing for a collective movement of the titania spheres at\nwill. Details of the experimental switching process are cur-\nrently under study and will be the subject of a later publica-\na\u0002Electronic mail: D.P.Aryal@surrey.ac.uk.\nb\u0002Present address: Institut des Nanotechologies de Lyon, CNRS UMR5270,\nUniversit\u00e9 de Lyon, INSA-Lyon, Villeurbanne F-69621, France.\nAPPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS 92, 011109 \u00012008\u0002\n0003-6951\/2008\/92\u00021\u0001\/011109\/3\/$23.00 \u00a9 2008 American Institute of Physics92, 011109-1\nDownloaded 30 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132.

For one switching state \u0003spheres in \u0001111\u0002\u0004,\nthe structure presents a complete PBG, hence, incident light\nonto the PC cannot penetrate the structure and is entirely\nreflected. This kind of surface will look like a very colorful\nmirror. For the other switching state \u0003spheres in \u0001100\u0002\u0004, there\nis no complete PBG, therefore, for certain directions, light\ncan penetrate and pass through the PC. For these directions,\nthe surface will be transparent. This phenomenon can be\nused for transparent\/opaque switchable surfaces or, in the\ncase of pixellization, for more complex devices, such as\ndisplays.\nThe optical properties of the DIOPC structure have been\nsimulated using ab initio band structure calculations, on the\nbasis of high-accuracy plane-wave expansions of the mag-\nnetic field components on a reciprocal lattice, combined with\nappropriate periodic boundary conditions.13 It is to be noted\nthat the shifting of the spheres from their central position\nbreaks some symmetries of the PC structure; hence, some\nhigh-symmetry points are not equivalent any more. This ef-\nfect is taken into account in the presented simulations when\ndetermining the position of the complete bandgap.

For\nsimplicity, the presence of the small inorganic inclusions is\nnot taken into account in these calculations. The radii of the\ncore, cylinder, and air pores are Rsp=0.13a, Rcyl=0.08a, and\nRp=0.354a, respectively, with a being the \u0001fcc\u0002 lattice con-\nstant of the crystal. One can observe from Fig. 2\u0001a\u0002 that a\ncomplete bandgap, highlighted by the dark blue region,\nopens up between the eighth band \u0001brown\u0002 at point W and the\nninth band \u0001red\u0002 at point X.\nSince the upper edge of the photonic bandgap is limited\nby the X point of the ninth band, and we empirically know\nthat the upper \u0001air\u0002 bands are usually more susceptible to\nmodifications in the refractive index distribution, we suspect\nthat shifting of the titania spheres toward the \u0001100\u0002 direction,\nwhich corresponds to the X point, can considerably alter the\nshape of the ninth band at that point, and result in the closing\nof the PBG. Prompted by this observation, we shift the inner\nspheres along \u0001100\u0002 and calculate the resulting dispersion\ndiagram. Figure 2\u0001b\u0002 reports the result of such calculation\nwith all optogeometric parameters being those of Fig. 2\u0001a\u0002.\nWe note that the previously complete bandgap is here alto-\ngether closed, with the perturbation of the ninth band being\nparticularly noticeable at point X, as anticipated. The influ-\nence of the shifting of the spheres on the X gap can also be\nseen by examining the field energy distributions at the X\npoint of the ninth band for the two switching states. The\ncorresponding three-dimensional energy density distributions\nare illustrated at the right hand side of the band diagrams in\nFigs. 2\u0001a\u0002 and 2\u0001b\u0002. One can clearly observe that the field\ncorresponding to the upper band is noticeably affected by the\nshifting of the dielectric spheres. Indeed, for the \u0001100\u0002\nswitching state, a high intensity field \u0001shown in red\u0002 develops\nand concentrates in a small area around the point where the\ntitania sphere \u0001yellow\u0002 touches the tin disulfide background\n\u0001shown in green\u0002. This high intensity spot is completely ab-\nsent in the \u0001111\u0002 switching state, as shown in the right hand\nside of Fig. 2\u0001a\u0002. From these results, we conclude that it is\npossible to completely open and close the photonic bandgap\nby changing the position of the titania spheres inside the air\npores of the DIOPC structure.\nCrucially, this scheme also allows for reasonable band-\ngap tuning and, furthermore, it turns out to be very stable\nwith respect to variations of Rcyl. The latter point is of great\nexperimental interest since the control of Rcyl during the fab-\nrication process is an important issue.12 Figure 3\u0001a\u0002 displays\nthe variations with cylinder radius of the complete PBGs that\noccur upon moving the titania spheres along the \u0001111\u0002 and\n\u0001100\u0002 directions. In the present case, the same relatively\nsmall, sphere radius Rsp=0.13a is chosen. This is to assure a\nsuitable compromise between effectively manipulating the\ndistribution of the fields when moving the spheres, which\nrequires a sizeable radius, and an abundant room for the\nshifting itself, which requires smaller spheres. Figure 3\u0001a\u0002\nshows that for this choice of Rsp switching of the complete\nPBG is, in principle, possible for the entire range of cylinder\nradii 0\u0001Rcyl\u00010.165a. The highlighted region indicates the\nexperimentally interesting range of cylinder radii, since the\nmaximum value that Rcyl can assume in practice has to be\nsmaller than Rsp, in order for each sphere to be confined to its\ncorresponding air pore and not fall through the cylinders.\nOne can also observe that within the aforesaid range we do\nnot have formation of a PBG for spheres shifted in the \u0001100\u0002\ndirection. Accordingly, the investigated switching mecha-\nnism can be completely independent of Rcyl, provided that\nRcyl remains relatively small. Moreover, within the afore-\nmentioned range of cylinder radii, the switchable PBG ex-\nceeds 1.5% and assumes a maximum value of approximately\n3.1%, with larger values being achievable upon further opti-\nmization of the structure.\nFinally, we analyzed the dependence of the complete\nPBG on the radius of the titania sphere, for fixed Rcyl\n=0.12a, and present the results in Fig. 3\u0001b\u0002. One may ob-\nserve that the curve which is associated with the \u0001100\u0002 shift\nof the spheres drops off faster compared to the curve which\ncorresponds to the \u0001111\u0002 shift. Accordingly, there is a region\nof sphere radii, 0.126a\u0001Rsp\u00010.178a, highlighted by the\ngray zone in Fig. 3\u0001b\u0002, wherein we can switch from a com-\nplete PBG when the spheres are shifted along \u0001111\u0002, to a\nclosed PBG when the spheres are shifted along \u0001100\u0002. Within\nthis range the maximum switchable PBG is a sizeable 3.3%.\nIn summary, we have presented a double-inverse-opal\nphotonic crystal structure, comprised of a tin disulfide back-\nground and titania core spheres, which allows for dynamic\nPBG tuning. We have found that the shifting of the embed-\nded titania spheres can substantially modify the optical prop-\nerties of the structure, to the point of allowing for complete\nand robust PBG switching. The scheme is conceptually\nsimple and elegant and, furthermore, there is compelling\nevidence that the fabrication process is reliable and\nsteadfast.11,12 This method for achieving transparent\/opaque\nswitching of material aspect conceivably heralds a fresh PC\ndesign paradigm to be used in the realization of iridescent\nsurfaces, switchable windows and in the dynamic control of\noptical properties.\nWe thank T.
