In this paper we extend the work presented\nby Morris & Jannuzi (2006) (paper I), where we set out the moti-\nvation for the project, defined the 16 lines-of-sight (LOS) observa-\ntional dataset, and established the existence of an absorber\u2013galaxy\ncorrelation using pair count analysis. We extend the analysis of this\ndataset to compute the absorber-galaxy 2-point correlation func-\ntion, \u03beAG, as a function of HI column density and compare the re-\nsults with other measurements and simulations.\nAs discussed and referenced extensively in paper I, the history\nof work in this area has been characterised by a debate between two\nextreme positions: (i) that low-redshift Ly\u03b1 absorbers arise in the\nhaloes of luminous galaxies; or (ii) that they are part of a filamen-\ntary network pervading the intergalactic medium (IGM), and are re-\nlated to galaxies only to the extent that they both trace the underly-\ning dark matter distribution. This polarised picture is undoubtedly a\nsimplification of a reality which now seems likely to require a mix-\nture of the two components in proportions which vary as a function\nof galaxy type, absorber column density and cosmic epoch. A fur-\nther complication arises from the expectation that at high redshift\ngalaxies are expected to blow most of their star-forming material\nout into the IGM as \u201csuperwinds\u201d. Such outflows are hypothesised\nto pollute the IGM with metals (Aguirre et al. 2001), to prevent the\nformation of over-luminous galaxies at z = 0 (Benson et al. 2003)\nand to account for the low-fraction of z = 0 baryons locked in\nstars. The measurement of \u03beAG provides a method to characterise\nthese feedback processes and to facilitate a direct comparison with\nsimulations. At z \u223c 2 \u2212 3, attempts have been made to mea-\n2 R.J. Wilman et al.\nsure the impact of superwinds on the IGM by cross-correlating\nHI and CIV absorption systems with UV selected galaxies, but\nthe early results were ambiguous (Adelberger et al. 2003). Sub-\nsequent measurements have clarified the situation (Adelberger et\nal. 2005), and reveal that strong Ly\u03b1 absorption is produced in\nintergalactic gas within 1h\u22121 comoving Mpc of \u223c 2\/3 of such\ngalaxies, and that strong CIV absorption (NCIV \u226b 1014 cm\u22122 )\nextends out to impact parameters of 40 kpc (proper) with a veloc-\nity range \u2206v > 260 kms\u22121 . Whether such superwind events have\nimprinted a relic signature on the galaxy-IGM relationship which\npersists to z < 1 is not known, but the measurements presented in\nthe present paper may provide some contraints on this issue (see\nalso Rauch et al 2005).\nIn paper I we showed that absorbers and galaxies are corre-\nlated out to impact parameters of at least 1.5 Mpc (physical) but that\nthis clustering is weaker than the galaxy-galaxy clustering in the\nsample. The velocity differences between absorber\u2013galaxy pairs\nwith detected CIV absorption are typically smaller than those with\nHI absorption only, but variations with HI column density were not\nassessed. Several other works have cross-correlated absorption line\ncatalogues with various low-z galaxy samples and reached broadly\nsimilar, but not identical, conclusions. Ryan-Weber (2006) cross-\ncorrelated galaxies selected in HI 21 cm emission with low column\ndensity (NHI < 1015 cm\u22122 ) Ly\u03b1 absorbers and found the clus-\ntering to be similar in strength to the clustering of the galaxies in\nthe sample in redshift space, but somewhat stronger in real space\non scales of 1\u201310h\u22121 Mpc. At somewhat higher column density,\nBouche\u00b4 et al. (2004) cross-correlated MgII absorbers with lumi-\nnous red galaxies (LRGs) at 0.4 \u2264 z \u2264 0.8, and over comov-\ning scales of 0.05\u201313h\u22121 Mpc found that the MgII-LRG cross-\ncorrelation amplitude is \u2243 30 per cent weaker than the LRG-\nLRG clustering. In a series of papers Prochaska and collaborators\nhave investigated the clustering of z < 0.5 galaxies around ab-\nsorbers along the sightline to the quasar PKS 0405-123 (Prochaska\net al. 2004; Chen et al. 2005; Prochaska et al. 2006). To the ex-\ntent that it is possible using a single sightline, they showed that\nemission-line galaxies and absorbers withNHI > 1014 cm\u22122 clus-\nter with a strength comparable to the galaxy-galaxy clustering,\nwhilst the absorption-line galaxies in their sample are not cor-\nrelated with absorbers 1. They also showed that absorbers with\nNHI < 10\n13.6 cm\u22122 are distributed more randomly with respect\nto galaxies, and that the strength of \u03beAG is insensitive to NHI for\n1013.6 < NHI < 10\n16.5 cm\u22122 . Also for this sightline, Williger\net al. (2006) found that the absorber-galaxy correlation function is\nsignificant out to \u2206v < 250 kms\u22121 and grows with minimum\nabsorber column density. Some of these conclusions can be tested\nwith our multiple LOS dataset and that is our aim here.\nFor completeness, we note that Chen et al. (2001) presented a\nsample of quasar lines of sight with HST FOS observations together\nwith galaxy redshifts. As mentioned in Morris & Jannuzi (2006),\nwe have chosen not to fold their data into our current analysis due\nto significant differences in survey strategy.\nThroughout the paper we adopt the cosmological parameters\n\u2126M = 0.3, \u2126\u039b = 0.7, and H0 = 100h kms\u22121 Mpc\u22121.\n1 For conformity with earlier works, we retain the nomenclature of\n\u2018emission-line\u2019 and \u2018absorption-line\u2019 galaxies to refer to galaxies whose\nspectra are dominated by emission line and absorption line features, re-\nspectively. The latter should not be confused with quasar absorption lines\nagainst which the galaxy populations are cross-correlated.\n2 THE ABSORBER-GALAXY 2-POINT CORRELATION\nFUNCTION\nThe absorber galaxy cross correlation function, \u03beAG, is defined\nthrough the expression for the conditional probability dP of find-\ning a galaxy in a volume dV at position r2, given that there is an\nabsorber at position r1:\ndP = ndV [1 + \u03beAG(r2 \u2212 r1)], (1)\nwhere n is the unconditional galaxy density.\nThe samples of absorption lines and galaxies which we will\nuse to compute \u03beAG are identical to those defined in paper I, where\nfull details can be found. In brief, the dataset comprises 16 quasar\nfields (from the Hubble Space Telescope Quasar Absorption Line\nKey Project dataset; Jannuzi et al. 1998), whose LOS contain a total\nof 381 Ly\u03b1 absorption lines and 30 CIV systems (25 at z < 1), and\na total of 685 galaxies with redshifts z < 1. As discussed in paper\nI, 49 of these galaxies have recession velocities < 500 kms\u22121 and\nare most likely stars, but their exact identification is irrelevant for\nthis study because 98 per cent of the HI absorbers are in any case at\nz > 0.3. The number of galaxies in the redshift range 0.3 \u2264 z \u2264 1\nwhich effectively overlap with the absorption line sample is 379.\nThe following estimator, introduced by Davis & Pee-\nbles (1983), is used to compute \u03beAG as a function of projected sep-\naration, \u03c3, and line-of-sight separation, pi:\n\u03beAG(\u03c3, pi) = AG\/AR\u2212 1, (2)\nwhere AG is the number of real absorber-galaxy pairs in the\nregion (\u03c3 \u2212 \u03b4\u03c3\/2 : \u03c3 + \u03b4\u03c3\/2, pi \u2212 \u03b4pi\/2 : pi + \u03b4pi\/2) and AR is\nthe suitably normalized number of absorber-random galaxy pairs at\nthe same location. Following Bouche\u00b4 et al. (2004), the numbers of\npairs in each of the quasar fields are normalized separately such that\nAR = \u03a3ARiN ig\/N\ni\nr , where the summation is over the 16 fields\nand N ig and N ir are the numbers of real and random galaxies in\nfield i, respectively. All absorber-galaxy separations are computed\nin comoving redshift space and the absorbers are assumed to be\nlocated at the sky position of the quasar LOS. For the assumed flat\ncosmology, the comoving distance to an object at redshift z is given\nby:\nXCM(z) =\nc\nH0\nZ z\n0\ndzp\n\u2126\u039b +\u2126M(1 + z)3\n(3)\nand hence for a close absorber-galaxy pair separated by \u2206z in red-\nshift and by an angle \u2206\u03b8 on the sky, \u03c3 and pi are given by:\n\u03c3 = XCM\u2206\u03b8 (4)\nand\npi =\ndXCM\ndz\n\u2206z. (5)\nSeveral crucial details of the computational method, namely\nthe generation of the random galaxy catalogue, the binning and\nsmoothing of \u03beAG, and the calculation of uncertainties, are dealt\nwith in the next subsection.\n2.1 Computational method\nRandom galaxy catalogues\nOur method requires a separate random galaxy catalogue for each\nquasar field in order to reflect any field-to-field differences in the\nThe association between gas and galaxies II: The 2-point correlation function 3\ngalaxy selection function. The latter mainly arise due to the place-\nment of slits and not from differences in spectroscopic depth. Fol-\nlowing Adelberger et al. (2003), we form such catalogues by re-\nplacing each real galaxy with 100 random galaxies, whose redshifts\nare drawn at random from the galaxy redshift distribution of the\nother fields, i.e. the real and random galaxies have the same posi-\ntions on the sky, but different redshifts. This reflects the fact that\ngalaxies in the sample must be located at the position of the slits.\nSpatial binning and smoothing of \u03beAG\nTo reduce the effects of shot noise due to the small numbers of\nabsorber-galaxy pairs on the measurement of \u03beAG, some consider-\nation must be given to the form of the numerical coordinate grid,\n(\u03c3, pi), on which it is evaluated. There are two approaches. The first\napproach adopts a grid whose cell-size is large enough to include\na sufficient number of absorber-galaxy pairs. An adaptively-sized\nmesh would be the best way to handle strong variations in the den-\nsity of absorber-galaxy pairs, but this would have the tendency to\ndilute the signal in regions where the paucity of pairs arises from a\ngenuinely strong anticorrelation signal with \u03beAG \u2243 \u22121.\nAn alternative approach is to bin the measurements much\nmore finely (if at all) and then to smooth the resulting field to re-\nmove the noise. Again, an adaptively-sized smoothing kernel could\nbe the best option. The two underlying density fields, AG(\u03c3, pi)\nand AR(\u03c3, pi), must be smoothed first and then ratioed to obtain\nthe smoothed \u03beAG, as in eqn. (2).\nIn this work we present results obtained using both the\nabove approaches: (i) on a uniform grid sampled as \u03c3 =\n0, 0.4, 0.8...2h\u22121 Mpc, pi = 2, 4, 6, ...20h\u22121 Mpc\u2013 referred to as\nthe \u2018binned\u2019 results (the 2h\u22121 Mpc bin size in the pi direction re-\nflects the \u2243 200 kms\u22121 spectral resolution; in the \u03c3 direction,\nthe field sizes dictate that galaxies are present out to maximum\ncomoving impact parameters of \u2243 2h\u22121 Mpc, which we have ar-\nbitrarily split into 5 equally spaced bins); (ii) on a finely-space\ngrid with the underlying density fields smoothed by a gaussian of\nFWHM = 0.8\u00d74h\u22121 Mpc, referred to as the \u2018smoothed\u2019 results.\nWe did not experiment with any adaptively-sized grids or smooth-\ning kernels.\nUncertainties on \u03beAG\nUsing the same method as Ryan-Weber (2006), we attempted to\nmeasure the uncertainties on \u03beAG using jackknife resampling in\nwhich the correlation function is computed N = 16 times with one\nsightline removed each time.\n\u03c32\u03be =\nN \u2212 1\nN\nX\ni\n(\u03be\u00af \u2212 \u03bei)\n2 (6)\nA disadvantage of this method is that at locations where there\nare no absorber-galaxy pairs in the full sample (i.e. \u03beAG = \u22121),\nall the individual \u03bei = \u22121 and hence \u03c3\u03be = 0. This highlights an-\nother problem of assessing the significance of the measured \u03beAG\nvalues, namely that there is no obvious figure of merit analogous\nto a signal-to-noise ratio, i.e. \u03beAG\/\u03c3\u03be is not a straightforward in-\ndication of a correlation\u2019s significance. An simpler alternative to\ncharacterise the significance of the observed correlation is to use\nPossion statistics, i.e. to calculate the probability of observing the\nreal number of absorber-galaxy pairs (AG) in a given cell, given the\nexpected number (AR). We will utilise both these approaches.\n3 RESULTS AND COMPARISON WITH OTHER WORKS\nIn so far as the sizes of our absorber and galaxy samples permit,\nour goal is to measure \u03beAG as a function of both HI column density\nand galaxy spectral type, and to compare with other results in the\nliterature.\n3.1 Dependence of absorber-galaxy cross-correlation\nfunction (\u03beAG) on absorber HI column density\nThe absorption line sample spans a range of HI column density\nfrom NHI = 1013 \u2212 1019 cm\u22122 , with the bulk of the lines being\nat the lower end of this range, as shown by the distribution in Ta-\nble 1. As discussed in paper I, the modest resolution of the HST\nFaint Object Spectrograph (FOS) (R=1300; 230 kms\u22121 ) means\nthat the Ly\u03b1 absorption features were typically unresolved, so col-\numn densities were inferred from the equivalent width assuming a\nDoppler b-parameter of 30 kms\u22121 . As shown in Fig. 1 of Wey-\nmann et al. (1998), the 4.5\u03c3 lower detection limit on the rest\nequivalent width (REW) of absorption features in these quasars de-\ncreases from 0.2A\u02da at z = 0.3 to 0.1A\u02da at z = 1. Considering that\nthe overlap between the galaxy and absorber sample is skewed to-\nward the lower end of this redshift range, the lower detection limit\nfor the absorber sample is effectively REW \u2243 0.2A\u02da, equating to\nNHI \u2243 10\n13.6 cm\u22122 . We note, however, that the Key Project ab-\nsorption line sample is not strictly complete for any REW value,\nbut has a detection limit which varies with both LOS and redshift\n(as discussed at length in paper I).\nIn the first calculation of \u03beAG we use the entire absorption line\nsample, i.e. NHI > 1013 cm\u22122 . The results are shown in Fig. 1\nwhere we also display the jackknife errors \u03c3\u03be and the distributions\nof absorber\u2013galaxy real (AG) and random (AR) pairs. The verti-\ncal banding in the distribution of random pairs results from an in-\ncreased volume per cell at larger projected distances and a fall-off\nin the galaxy density at the largest radii in our sample. Observe that\nwhilst the correlation function itself clearly peaks in the cell at the\nsmallest separations, the peak in the absolute number of absorber-\ngalaxy pairs is spatially offset, due to volume effects. This high-\nlights the value of basing inferences about statistical associations\non \u03beAG rather than on the raw pair counts. The peak \u2018signal-to-\nnoise\u2019 ratio, \u03beAG\/\u03c3\u03be, is approximately 3.\nThe evaluation of \u03beAG for various absorber sub-samples is\npresented in Fig. 2, with the same binning scheme as that used\nin Fig. 1. As the lower threshold on the HI column density is in-\ncreased from 1013 \u2212 1016 cm\u22122 , the strength of the central peak\nin \u03beAG also increases smoothly from \u2243 4.5 to \u2243 6.7. At NHI >\n1017 cm\u22122 the peak strength jumps dramatically to\u2243 15 although\nthe formal jackknife error is substantial. For absorber samples with\na lower maximum HI column density, the peak in \u03beAG is of lower\namplitude,\u2243 3. For the absorbers with NHI = 1013\u22121015 cm\u22122 ,\nthe peak is spatially offset from the central position. These results\nare summarised in Table 2 where we list the peak values of \u03beAG,\ntheir jackknife uncertainties, and statistical significance assuming\nPoisson statistics. In Fig. 3 we show cross-correlation functions\nfor the same HI column density intervals evaluated on a fine grid\nbut with the underlying pair count fields heavily smoothed, as de-\nscribed in section 2.1.\nIn Fig. 3 we also show the auto-correlation function of the\ngalaxies in the sample. We note that whilst the peak value is com-\nparable to other measurements of the galaxy-galaxy 2-point cor-\nrelation function on scales of 1\u20132h\u22121 Mpc (e.g. from the 2DF;\nHawkins et al. 2003), it is formally lower than the peak in \u03beAG for\n4 R.J.

We also note that other authors\nhave compared the absorber-galaxy cross-correlation function to\nthe galaxy-galaxy auto-correlation function to estimate the mass of\nthe dark matter haloes in which the absorbers are embedded. Whilst\nthis procedure is acceptable for Damped Lyman Alpha absorbers\n(which are likely to be galaxies) (e.g. Bouche\u00b4 et al. 2004), it is not\nappropriate for diffuse Ly\u03b1 absorbers below NHI = 1015 cm\u22122 .\nThe latter are likely to arise in unbound cosmological filaments\n(e.g. Dave\u00b4 et al. 1999) so we do not pursue such calculations here.\nIndeed, Ryan-Weber (2006) used this method and found that weak\nLy\u03b1 absorbers should arise in 1014M\u2299 groups; this seems unphys-\nical since gas in such groups would be quite hot, while the individ-\nual galaxies\u2019 interstellar media do not have nearly the cross-section\nto reproduce the counting statistics of weaker Ly\u03b1 forest absorbers.\nFor CIV absorbers, Fig. 2 shows that the peak strength of \u03beAG\nis comparable to that of HI absorbers with NHI > 1016.5 cm\u22122 .\nThis is not surprising as in our dataset the median HI column den-\nsity of CIV absorbers is 1017.7 cm\u22122 , while the median of the full\nLy\u03b1 absorber sample is 1014.2 cm\u22122 . The median HI column den-\nsity of Ly\u03b1 absorbers with NHI > 1016.5 cm\u22122 is 1017.45 cm\u22122 .\n3.2 Dependence of \u03beAG on galaxy spectral type\nChen et al. (2005) reported that the strength of the absorber-galaxy\ncross-correlation may be dependent on galaxy spectral type, in the\nsense that a strong correlation signal is found for emission-line\ngalaxies but not for absorption-line galaxies. Here we investigate\nthis issue by splitting our galaxy sample into two sub-samples, ac-\ncording to whether the redshift assigned in paper I was obtained by\nidentification of a strong emission line or where no such emission\nline could be seen. The resulting emission-line and absorption-line\ngalaxy samples contain 406 and 225 galaxies, respectively. Of the\noriginal full galaxy sample of 685, a total of 54 galaxies could not\nbe classified and were not included in this analysis: 8 of them have\nspectra with an ambiguous classification, and the redshifts of 46\ngalaxies were obtained from the literature without associated spec-\ntral information (see paper I for full details). The 225 absorption-\nline galaxies include most of the 49 very low redshift objects which\nwere classified as probable stars in paper I, but this is not critical\nbecause such objects are too low in redshift to overlap with the ab-\nsorption line sample.\nThese two galaxy samples were cross-correlated with the full\nHI absorption line catalogue (i.e. NHI > 1013 cm\u22122 ) and the re-\nsults are displayed in Fig. 4. For the emission-line sample, the form\nof \u03beAG is qualitatively similar to the result obtained with the full\ngalaxy sample (Fig. 1), but the peak strength is now marginally\n(but not significantly) higher at\u2243 5.8, compared with 4.4\u00b11.7 for\nthe full galaxy sample. With just the absorption-line galaxies, the\ncentral peak in \u03beAG is observed to be displaced from the central bin\nto 2\u20134 h\u22121 Mpc along the LOS, although we do not claim that this\nis necessarily a statistically significant finding, in view of the much\nsmaller size of the absorption-line galaxy sample. A more direct\ncomparison with the 1-D results of Chen et al. is presented in the\nnext subsection.\n3.3 Comparison with other works\nOf the \u03beAG measurements mentioned in the Introduction, that by\nChen et al. (2005) is the most similar to our work in its method-\nology, as it is based on an optical magnitude-limited galaxy red-\nshift survey along the LOS to a single quasar (PKS 0405-123 at\nz = 0.5726). Here we make a comparison between our results\nand their 1-D measurements of \u03beAG as function of galaxy type. We\nbegin with a summary of the Chen et al. dataset. Their galaxy sam-\nple comprises 482 galaxies with R \u2264 20 mag and spectroscopic\nredshifts over a 1600 arcmin2 area within a 5h\u22121 Mpc (comov-\ning) impact parameter of the quasar LOS; the redshift distribution\nhas a broad peak at z \u2243 0.2. For their \u03beAG analysis they restrict\ntheir attention to galaxies with impact parameter < 1h\u22121 Mpc of\nthe LOS, of which there are 61 (46 emission-line galaxies, and\n15 absorption-line galaxies; no details of the spectral classification\nmethod are given). The redshift distribution of this small impact\nparameter subsample is skewed towards lower redshifts compared\nwith the entire sample, with a median redshift z \u2243 0.1. They claim\na galaxy redshift accuracy of \u2206z = \u00b10.0002, or \u223c 40 kms\u22121 .\nThe Chen et al. absorption line sample comprises 112 Ly\u03b1\nsystems at redshifts 0.01 \u2264 z \u2264 0.557 with HI column den-\nsities logNHI = 12.5 \u2212 16.5 (80 per cent of the lines are at\nlogNHI < 13.6, the regime in which our absorption line sample is\nmost incomplete). The bulk of the lines were derived from observa-\ntions with the HST Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS)\nwith spectral resolution of 6.7 kms\u22121 . The latter is substantially\nhigher than the \u223c 230 kms\u22121 resolution of the FOS spectra from\nwhich our absorption line sample was derived. Compared with our\ndataset, the Chen et al. sample can thus in principle probe \u03beAG on\n(i) smaller velocity scales; (ii) for weaker absorption lines ; (iii)\nwith fewer complications arising from absorption line blending.\nThe first two of these differences can be handled by comparing on\nappropriate \u2206v scales and for sufficiently high NHI, but the issue\nThe association between gas and galaxies II: The 2-point correlation function 5\n0 0.4 0.8 1.2 1.6 2.0\nProjected distance (1\/h Mpc)\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\n20\nLO\nS \ndi\nst\nan\nce\n (1\n\/h \nMp\nc)\n-1\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n0 0.4 0.8 1.2 1.6 2.0\nProjected distance (1\/h Mpc)\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\n20\nLO\nS \ndi\nst\nan\nce\n (1\n\/h \nMp\nc)\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n0 0.4 0.8 1.2 1.6 2.0\nProjected distance (1\/h Mpc)\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\n20\nLO\nS \ndi\nst\nan\nce\n (1\n\/h \nMp\nc)\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n0 0.4 0.8 1.2 1.6 2.0\nProjected distance (1\/h Mpc)\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\n20\nLO\nS \ndi\nst\nan\nce\n (1\n\/h \nMp\nc)\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nAG\u03be \u03be\u03c3\nreal pairs random pairs (normalised)\nHIlog N    >   13\nFigure 1. For the complete sample of absorbers with NHI > 1013 cm\u22122 , the figure shows the absorber-galaxy 2-point correlation function\n(top left), \u03beAG, determined using the real and random absorber-galaxy pairs counts (AG and AR, respectively, in eqn (2)) (lower left and\nright, respectively). Also shown is the uncertainty on \u03beAG derived using jackknife resampling, eqn. (6) (top right).\nof line blending in the FOS spectra is less straightforward and will\nbe discussed later.\nMindful of the above differences between the datasets, we re-\nstrict our attention to a comparison with the Chen et al. \u03beAG mea-\nsurements for absorption lines with logNHI = 14.0 \u2212 16.5. Chen\net al. computed \u03beAG for galaxies within 1h\u22121 Mpc comoving of\nthe LOS for the entire galaxy sample and its emission-line and\nabsorption-line galaxy subsamples, computed out to LOS velocity\nseparations of \u2206v = 5000 kms\u22121 . Converting \u2206v to comoving\ndistance, we plot the Chen et al. measurements along with our re-\nsults out to LOS separations of 20h\u22121 Mpc in Fig. 5. Error bars on\nour data points were derived using jackknife resampling; Chen et\nal. give no details of their error bar computation.\nThe plots in Fig. 5 demonstrate that we do not reproduce the\nhigh peak in \u03beAG at the smallest separations (comoving LOS sep-\narations < 2h\u22121 Mpc) found by Chen et al. for the entire galaxy\nsample: our peak values are more than 2\u03c3 apart. Possibly related to\nthis, we also do not substantiate their finding of much stronger \u03beAG\nfor the emission-line galaxies as compared with the absorption-\nline galaxies. Whilst our dataset is substantially larger than that\nof Chen et al. in terms of the numbers of galaxies (our study: 179\ngalaxies with impact parameters< 1h\u22121 Mpc overlapping with the\nabsorption-line redshift distribution; Chen et al: 61 galaxies) and\nabsorbers (our study: 180; Chen et al.: 15), a much larger dataset\nwill be needed to address more conclusively any dependence of\n\u03beAG on galaxy type. It should also be borne in mind that the Chen\net al. study is effectively at redshift z \u223c 0.1 (in terms of maximal\noverlap between absorber and galaxy samples), whereas our study\nis at z \u223c 0.5. Concerning the possible impact of different degrees\nof absorption-line blending in quasar spectra from the FOS and\nSTIS, we refer to Penton, Stocke & Shull (2004): they smoothed\ntheir STIS\/Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph (GHRS) spec-\ntra to FOS resolution and found a 15\u201325 per cent increase in the line\ndensity at REW> 0.24A\u02da (NHI \u2243 1014 cm\u22122 for b = 30 kms\u22121 )\ndue to the blending of weaker lines. Since Chen et al. found that\nthese weaker absorption lines correlate much less strongly with\ngalaxies, this alone would suppress our peak \u03beAG values by 25\u2013\n35 per cent relative to their measurements, going some way to ex-\nplaining the differences in Fig. 5. However, the full impact on the\n\u03beAG measurements of differences between our respective galaxy\nand absorption-line samples merits further investigation. Finally we\nnote that the 1-D \u03beAG in Fig. 5 all exhibit possible minima at LOS\nseparations \u2243 10h\u22121 Mpc, similar to the feature in the smoothed\n2-D plots of Fig. 3; the physical origin of this feature is not known.\n6 R.J.

As in the Chen et al. absorption\nline sample, this absorption line sample is based on HST STIS and\nGHRS spectra and thus provides considerably higher velocity res-\nolution and weak line sensitivity compared with our sample. The\ngalaxy sample is biased towards gas-rich galaxies, including gas-\nrich dwarf and low surface brightness galaxies often absent from\nmagnitude-limited optical catalogues such as ours. These differ-\nences, together with the lower redshift of her measurements (which\nare effectively at z \u2243 0), might account for the extreme LOS elon-\ngation seen in her \u03beAG measurements \u2013 out to 10h\u22121 Mpc comov-\ning \u2013 which we do not reproduce. Indeed, morphological analysis\nof the optical counterparts to the 1000 brightest HIPASS sources\nconfirms that the majority are late-type gas-rich galaxies (Zwaan\net al. 2003). The origins of this LOS elongation are explored fur-\nther in section 4.2 below with the help of SPH simulations. In\nseeking to compare our \u03beAG results with those of Ryan-Weber,\nan important first step is to compare the ranges of galaxy mass\nprobed by the two surveys. Ryan-Weber states that the geometric\nmean HI mass of galaxies contributing to absorber-galaxy pairs is\nlog(MHI\/M\u2299) = 8.8h\n\u22122\n, with a corresponding dark halo mass\nof log(M\/M\u2299) = 11.0h\u22121 (as inferred from modelling by Mo\net al. 2005). In contrast, our galaxy sample was selected by R-band\nimaging and follow-up spectroscopy and is thus expected to contain\na higher fraction of early-type galaxies. In paper I (section 2.3.5)\nwe attempted to place bounds on the rest-frame B-band absolute\nmagnitudes of our galaxy sample: confining our attention to galax-\nies at redshifts 0.35 \u2264 z \u2264 0.8 which overlap with the absorption\nline sample, we find that the vast majority of these galaxies have\n\u221222 \u2264 MB \u2264 \u221218 mag, with a median MB \u2243 \u221220.5 mag.\nWith reference to models of the conditional probability distribution\nof halo masses (e.g. Cooray 2005 and references therein), we ex-\npect galaxies at this median luminosity to be hosted by dark matter\nhaloes of mass \u223c 1012\u221213h\u22121M\u2299.\nWe note that not only are our galaxies hosted by more mas-\nsive haloes than those of Ryan-Weber, but that the two samples fall\neither side of a critical halo mass, at which the nature of gas ac-\ncretion onto galaxies is thought to change. Using SPH simulations,\nKeres et al. (2005) find that galaxies hosted by haloes withMhalo \u2264\n1011.4M\u2299 (or, equivalently, baryonic mass Mgal \u2264 1010.3M\u2299)\nacquire most of their gas via \u2019cold mode\u2019 accretion in which gas\nat T < 105K is efficiently drawn in from large distances along\nfilaments. For more massive galaxies, the dominant mechanism is\nquasi-spherical accretion of hot shocked gas at the virial temper-\nature of the halo, more akin to the classical picture outlined by\nWhite & Rees (1978). Moreover, this transition in accretion mode\nis a strong function of halo mass over the range of interest: from\nMhalo = 10\n11M\u2299 to 1012M\u2299, the fraction of gas accreted by\nthe \u2018cold mode\u2019 accretion varies from > 0.9 to < 0.1, virtually\nindependent of redshift. Similar results have been found by Dekel\n& Birnboim (2006). We do not wish to claim that this switch from\ncold mode filamentary accretion in Ryan-Weber\u2019s HIPASS galaxies\nto hot mode accretion in our galaxies can wholly explain the differ-\nent degrees of LOS elongation in \u03beAG measurements using the two\nsamples, but it may be a useful signpost to fruitful areas of future\ninvestigation.\n4 COMPARISON WITH SPH SIMULATIONS\nIn this section we use cosmological simulations to generate syn-\nthetic 2D absorber-galaxy correlation functions to compare with\nthe observations, and to gain insight into the physical origin of fea-\ntures such as the \u2018finger of god\u2019 which is seen in the results of\nRyan-Weber (2006).\nWe ran a simulation using Gadget-2 (Springel & Hernquist\n2003) with improvements as described in Oppenheimer & Dave\u00b4\n(2006), in a cubic comoving volume of 64h\u22121Mpc on a side. We\nemployed the momentum-driven outflow model \u2018vzw\u2019 as described\nin Oppenheimer & Dave\u00b4 , and a cosmology concordant with 3rd-\nyear WMAP results (Spergel et al. 2006): \u2126m = 0.26, \u2126\u039b = 0.74,\nH0 = 71 km\/s\/Mpc, \u03c38 = 0.75, and \u2126b = 0.044. The force reso-\nlution is 5h\u22121kpc, and the mass per gas particle is 2.72\u00d7 108M\u2299.\nThe galaxy finding procedure is described in Finlator et al. (2006),\nusing a minimum resolved galaxy stellar mass of 8.7\u00d7 109M\u2299.\nThe simulation volume was pierced by 1000 randomly-located\nsightlines to simulate quasar spectra, and absorption line profiles\nwere fitted using AutoVP (Dave\u00b4 et al. 1997). Absorber-galaxy pairs\nwere measured and tabulated from these spectra for LOS sepa-\nrations \u2206v < 1600 kms\u22121 and projected separations of \u2206r <\n16Mpc (physical). Following conversion of pair separations into\ncomoving redshift space, these catalogues were used to create 2-D\nabsorber-galaxy correlation functions. Two such absorber-galaxy\n8 R.J.

Error bars on our data\npoints have been displaced in the x-direction for clarity.\npair catalogues were created in order to compare with our observa-\ntional results and those of Ryan-Weber, as we now describe.\n4.1 Tuning the simulations to compare with the\nobservational results\nFirstly, to compare with the observational results presented in sec-\ntion 3 of this paper, the simulation output was extracted at z = 0.5\n(giving a total redshift pathlength of \u2206z = 26.4). The pixel scale\nof the quasar spectra was set to 70 kms\u22121 and convolved with a\nGaussian of 230 kms\u22121 FWHM, in order to match the resolution\nof the HST Faint Object Spectrograph. HI absorption lines were se-\nlected with rest equivalent width REW > 0.056A\u02da, corresponding\nto column densities NHI > 1013 cm\u22122 for b = 30kms\u22121 . The\nstrength of the ionizing background radiation was increased by a\nfactor of 4 over the Haardt & Madau (1996) value in order to nor-\nmalise the dN\/dz value for REW > 0.24A\u02da lines to the HST Ab-\nsorption Line Key Project results (Weymann et al. 1998). The en-\ntire resolved galaxy population was used for the comparison, with a\ngalaxy density of 0.01145 per cubic h\u22121 Mpc comoving above the\n8.7 \u00d7 109M\u2299 baryonic mass limit. As shown by, for example, the\nDeep Evolutionary Exploratory Probe 2 (DEEP2) Galaxy Redshift\nSurvey (Willmer et al. 2006), this is comparable to the space den-\nsity of galaxies at this redshift in an absolute range which matches\nour observed galaxy sample (\u221222 \u2264 MB \u2264 \u221218 mag; see section\n3).\nThe second absorber-galaxy pair catalogue was extracted from\nthe simulations at redshift z = 0 (giving a total redshift path-\nlength of \u2206z = 21.3) to compare with the Ryan-Weber results.\nThe spectral resolution of the artifical quasar sightlines was set\nto 8kms\u22121 to mimic the higher resolution HST STIS and GHRS\nspectra, and HI absorption lines were extracted for REW=0.0126\u2013\n0.45A\u02da, corresponding to 1012.4 < NHI < 1014.8 cm\u22122 for\nb = 30 kms\u22121 . Mimicing the HIPASS selection of galaxies in\nHI emission by means of a simple cut in baryonic mass is a crude\napproximation, but it is the only tool at our disposal with the current\nsimulation. Somewhat arbitrarily, we use an upper baryonic mass\ncut-off for galaxies of 2\u00d71010M\u2299. To put this figure in context, we\nrefer to some results from Durham semi-analytic models of galaxy\nformation (Cedric Lacey, private communication; for the latest im-\nplementation of such models see Bower et al. 2006). Such models\ntrack the behaviour of gas and stars in dark matter haloes with sim-\nple physical prescriptions. At redshift z = 0, dark halo masses of\n1011, 1012, 1013 and 1014h\u22121M\u2299 contain galaxies of total bary-\nonic mass (hot gas, cold gas and stars) of 1010, 8.6 \u00d7 1010, 1012\nand 1013M\u2299, respectively. The corresponding cold gas masses are\n1.7\u00d7 109, 6.7\u00d7 109, 3.3\u00d7 1010 and 2.7\u00d7 1011M\u2299, respectively.\nA baryonic mass cut off of 2\u00d7 1010M\u2299 corresponds to a cold gas\nmass of 4.2\u00d7109M\u2299 and a dark halo mass of 2.5\u00d71011h\u22121M\u2299.\nAs stated in section 3, the HIPASS galaxies contributing to Ryan-\nWeber\u2019s absorber-galaxy pairs have mean HI and dark halo masses\nof 108.8\/h2 and 1011\/hM\u2299, respectively. The space density of\nthese simulated galaxies is 0.006107 per cubic h\u22121 Mpc comov-\ning.\n4.2 Results: the simulated \u03beAG and the origin of the \u2018finger of\ngod\u2019\nThe two-dimensional \u03beAG which result from the simulations de-\nscribed in section 4.1 are displayed in Fig. 6.

(a) The simulation with STIS-resolution\nsightlines, cross-correlating 1012.4 < NHI < 1014.8 cm\u22122 absorbers with galaxies of baryonic mass < 2 \u00d7 1010M\u2299 at z = 0.

(c) The simulation with FOS-resolution sightlines, cross-correlating NHI >\n1013 cm\u22122 absorbers at z = 0.5 with the entire resolved galaxy population; (d) as in (c) but binned\/smoothed as in Ryan-Weber (2006).\nto match our results in Fig. 2 (although the simulated plots ex-\ntend out to slightly smaller LOS distances), and secondly using the\ntechnique of Ryan-Weber. The latter evaluates \u03beAG on a fine grid\n(0.1\u00d7 0.1h\u22121 Mpc) and then smoothes the resulting \u03beAG by 9\u00d7 9\npixels. Note that this differs from the smoothing procedure we used\nto generate Fig. 3, where the underlying pair counts were smoothed\nbefore computing \u03beAG.\nComparing the simulations of Fig. 6 with our observational\nresults in Fig. 2 and with the results of Ryan-Weber, we notice\nthat both sets of observed \u03beAG are much more strongly peaked\nat the smallest separations than the simulations, i.e. we observe\nmuch more gas at small velocity offset and\/or close to the galax-\nies than present in the simulations. Redshift measurement errors\nin the observations would tend to weaken such peaks, so this can-\nnot be the origin of the discrepancy. A related issue is the asym-\nmetric elongation of the simulated \u03beAG in redshift space along the\nLOS, which is qualitatively similar to that found by Ryan-Weber\nbut which appears to be absent from our measurements. Such a\nfeature is analogous to that seen in the autocorrelation function of\ngalaxies (see e.g. Hawkins et al. 2003), where it arises from de-\npartures from Hubble flow due to virialised motions in groups and\nclusters. Commonly referred to as the \u2018finger of god\u2019, the effect was\nseen in \u03beAG in an earlier generation of cosmological simulations\n(e.g. Dave\u00b4 et al. 1999) but its physical interpretation is not as clear\nas in the galaxy-galaxy case. Ryan-Weber (2006) interpreted it as\narising from the draining of gas from low-density regions into col-\nlapsed structures. In a subsequent paper we will address the role of\ngalaxy outflows in causing the \u2018finger of god\u2019, and also investigate\nthe dependence of \u03beAG on galaxy mass and absorption line column\ndensity. A more ambitious goal is to simulate the full observational\ndataset, including the selection of the galaxies in a somewhat more\nrealistic manner than is possible with the existing cuts in total bary-\nonic mass.\nIn closing this section, we comment on another possible ex-\nplanation for the \u2018finger of god\u2019 which merits further investigation.\nIt may be a geometrical effect which leads to a bias towards observ-\ning large numbers of galaxy-absorber pairs at small projected sky\nseparations when a LOS is oriented directly down an IGM filament\nwith clumpy HI absorption. At redshifts z \u2264 2, simulations show\nthat absorbing gas with NHI < 1015 cm\u22122 resides in a filamentary\n10 R.J. Wilman et al.\nnetwork (e.g. Dave\u00b4 et al. 1999), whereas at higher redshifts such\ngas is distributed more diffusely. This basic structure evolves little\nover 0 \u2264 z \u2264 2 but absorbing material of a given column density\nbecomes increasingly clumpy towards lower redshifts. This might\npartially account for the increased LOS elongation measured by\nRyan-Weber at z \u2243 0 compared with our measurements at z \u2243 0.5,\nbut further investigations are needed. If only a very small propor-\ntion of sightlines are fortuitously aligned with filaments, it is much\nmore likely that such chance alignments occur in the simulations\n(1000 LOS; \u2206z \u223c 25) which have a much higher redshift path-\nlength than our dataset (16 LOS; \u2206z \u223c 3) or that of Ryan-Weber\n(27 LOS; \u2206z \u223c 1).\n5 CONCLUSIONS\nIn summary, our measurements show that the strength of the corre-\nlation function between HI quasar absorption systems and galaxies\nincreases with HI column density, certainly for comoving separa-\ntions < 0.4h\u22121 Mpc (projected) and < 2h\u22121 Mpc (line-of-sight)\nwhere the signal:noise of our measurements is greatest. The peak\nstrength of the absorber-galaxy clustering increases only slowly\nas the lower NHI limit is increased from 1013 to 1016 cm\u22122 , but\nthen jumps considerably (albeit with substantial uncertainty) above\n1017 cm\u22122 . If real, such a jump may reflect the transition from ab-\nsorption within the filamentary IGM to absorption within the haloes\nof individual galaxies. The peak strength of the CIV absorber-\ngalaxy cross-correlation is comparable to that of the HI absorber-\ngalaxy signal for NHI > 1016.5 cm\u22122 .\nOur results are broadly consistent with the finding of Chen et\nal. (2005), based on the sightline to the quasar PKS 0405-123, that\nthe absorber-galaxy cross-correlation strength is insensitive to HI\ncolumn density in the range 1013.6 \u2264 NHI < 1016.5 cm\u22122 , al-\nthough Table 2 shows evidence for a weak increase with NHI. We\nfind tentative but inconclusive evidence for differences in the 2-D\nabsorber-galaxy cross correlation function for our subsamples of\nemission-line and absorption-line galaxies, but we do not substan-\ntiate the claim of Chen et al. that the 1-D cross-correlation signal\nis much higher for emission-line galaxies than for absorption-line\ngalaxies. This discrepancy between our results and those of Chen et\nal. is not fully understood, but it may be partially ascribed to the ef-\nfects of line blending in the FOS spectra compared with the higher\nresolution STIS quasar spectra.\nComparison was also made with the results of Ryan-\nWeber (2006) on the cross-correlation of HI-selected galaxies with\nquasar absorbers with 1012.4 \u2264 NHI < 1014.8 cm\u22122 , who find\na marked \u2018finger of god\u2019 elongation out to 10h\u22121 Mpc along the\nsight. Such a feature appears to be absent from our measure-\nments, but we demonstrated that there are significant differences\nin the characteristic mass of our respective galaxy samples which\nmay account for such differences. The dark matter halo masses\nof the two samples fall either side of a critical dark halo mass of\n1011.4M\u2299 (with the Ryan-Weber sample being lower in mass), at\nwhich simulations show that the nature of the dominant mode of\ngas accretion onto galaxies changes fundamentally from cold fila-\nmentary accretion in low mass haloes to hot quasi-spherical accre-\ntion (Keres et al. 2005).\nWe also constructed synthetic absorber-galaxy 2-point corre-\nlation functions using output from a 64h\u22121 Mpc box SPH simula-\ntion aimed at reproducing our own observational results and those\nof Ryan-Weber (2006). The simulations revealed somewhat less\ngas at the smallest separations from galaxies than present in the\nobservations and a strong \u2018finger of god\u2019 elongation of \u03beAG along\nthe LOS. These discrepancies may originate in true deficiencies in\nthe physics of the SPH simulations, or in a failure to accurately\nmimic the observed galaxy selection functions, or through some\nmore subtle selection effect.\nFor future work, we suggest that effort be invested to under-\nstand the dominant contribution to the \u2018finger of god\u2019 elongation\nin \u03beAG, and the nature of the apparent transition in \u03beAG between\nNHI = 10\n16 and 1017 cm\u22122 . On the theoretical side, comparison\nshould be made with a variety SPH simulations matching the obser-\nvational selection function more closely. On the observational side,\nit would also be valuable to conduct surveys for higher-redshift\ngalaxies around existing HST Quasar Absorption Line Key Project\nsightlines to ensure a better match between the redshift distribu-\ntions of the absorption lines and the galaxies, and around higher-\nresolution HST STIS quasar sightlines. It would also be valuable to\nsurvey some of these sightlines with large-format IFUs to enhance\nsensitivity to emission-line galaxies which may be preferentially\nmissed by our existing broad-band optical selection techniques.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work has been partially financed by a Rolling Grant at Durham\nUniversity from the UK Particle Physics and Astronomy Research\nCouncil.
