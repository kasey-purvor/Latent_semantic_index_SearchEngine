While infectious diseases still account for at least 69% \nof deaths on the continent, age specific mortality rates from chronic diseases as a whole are actually higher in sub \nSaharan Africa than in virtually all other regions of the world, in both men and women. Over the next ten years the \ncontinent is projected to experience the largest increase in death rates from cardiovascular disease, cancer, respiratory \ndisease and diabetes. African health systems are weak and national investments in healthcare training and service \ndelivery continue to prioritise infectious and parasitic diseases. There is a strong consensus that Africa faces significant \nchallenges in chronic disease research, practice and policy. This editorial reviews eight original papers submitted to a \nGlobalization and Health special issue themed: \"Africa's chronic disease burden: local and global perspectives\". The \npapers offer new empirical evidence and comprehensive reviews on diabetes in Tanzania, sickle cell disease in Nigeria, \nchronic mental illness in rural Ghana, HIV\/AIDS care-giving among children in Kenya and chronic disease interventions \nin Ghana and Cameroon. Regional and international reviews are offered on cardiovascular risk in Africa, comorbidity \nbetween infectious and chronic diseases and cardiovascular disease, diabetes and established risk factors among \npopulations of sub-Saharan African descent in Europe. We discuss insights from these papers within the contexts of \nmedical, psychological, community and policy dimensions of chronic disease. There is an urgent need for primary and \nsecondary interventions and for African health policymakers and governments to prioritise the development and \nimplementation of chronic disease policies. Two gaps need critical attention. The first gap concerns the need for \nmultidisciplinary models of research to properly inform the design of interventions. The second gap concerns \nunderstanding the processes and political economies of policy making in sub Saharan Africa. The economic impact of \nchronic diseases for families, health systems and governments and the relationships between national policy making \nand international economic and political pressures have a huge impact on the risk of chronic diseases and the ability of \ncountries to respond to them.\nIntroduction\nAfrica bears a significant proportion of the global burden\nof chronic diseases, along with poor countries of Asia and\nLatin America (see appendix 1). The World Health\nOrganisation (WHO) projects that over the next ten\nyears the continent will experience the largest increase in\ndeath rates from cardiovascular disease, cancer, respira-\ntory disease and diabetes [1]. Africa's chronic disease\nburden is attributed to multifaceted factors including\nincreased life expectancy, changing lifestyle practices,\npoverty, urbanisation and globalisation [1]. Rising mor-\nbidity and mortality from chronic diseases co-exist with\nan even greater burden of infectious disease, which still\naccounts for at least 69% of deaths on the continent [2].\nMany African health systems are under-funded and\nunder-resourced and struggle to cope with the cumula-\ntive burden of infectious and chronic diseases. An esti-\nmated 80% of regional health budgets has been allocated\nto communicable disease for the last decade [3,4]. Health\nministries acknowledge the presence and impact of a\nchronic disease burden, but few countries have chronic\ndisease plans or policies [5]. Historically, formal health-\ncare in Africa has developed in response to acute com-\nmunicable diseases and diseases of environmental\ndegradation and pollution [6]. Therefore most health sys-\ntems prioritise training and expertise in communicable\ndisease and underestimate the importance of building\n* Correspondence: ada21@cam.ac.uk\n1 Department of Social and Developmental Psychology, Faculty of Politics, \nPsychology, Sociology and International Studies, University of Cambridge, \nCambridge, UK\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the articleBioMed Central\n\u00a9 2010 de-Graft Aikins et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

In many coun-\ntries high rates of avoidable complications and deaths\nhave been attributed to weak health systems [7-10]. There\nis a strong consensus that Africa faces significant chal-\nlenges in chronic disease research, practice and policy.\nThis special issue in Globalization and Health presents\nnew empirical evidence and comprehensive reviews on\nthe local and global challenges of Africa's chronic disease\nburden. It is the product of a workshop organised by the\nUK-Africa Academic Partnership on Chronic Disease at\nthe London School of Economics and Political Science\n(LSE) in June 2008. The partnership was established in\n2006 with funding from the British Academy and man-\naged by lead partners at Cambridge University and the\nUniversity of Ghana. It now constitutes a network of\nsocial and medical scientists working from nine countries\nin Africa, Asia and Europe and from the US who are col-\nlaborating on interdisciplinary models for chronic disease\nresearch, intervention and policy to help to address the\npublic health challenges posed by chronic diseases in\nAfricans both in Africa and in the diaspora (see appendix\n2). The LSE workshop brought together established and\nyoung career researchers from Africa, UK and other\nEuropean countries to explore chronic disease research,\npractice and policy for African communities.\nPrevious issues in other journals have focused either on\nthe global chronic disease burden (e.g Lancet, 2005 [11])\nor on Africa's disease burden with an emphasis on infec-\ntious diseases (BMJ, 2005 [12]). Globalization and Health\nhas featured articles in the past that discuss the role of\nglobalization and global health governance on chronic\ndisease determinants (e.g Hawkes (2006) on the nutrition\ntransition [13]) or on policy development (e.g Magnus-\nsen, 2007 [14]), but with limited focus on Africa. This\nspecial issue focuses on Africa's chronic disease burden,\noffers multidisciplinary analyses of challenges and identi-\nfies practical and policy solutions. We group and intro-\nduce the eight papers under four categories to reflect the\nworkshop panel themes: (1) Medical dimensions of\nchronic disease in Africa; (2) Psychological dimensions of\nchronic disease in Africa; (3) Role of communities in\ntackling chronic disease; and (4) National and interna-\ntional dimensions of fighting chronic disease.\nMedical dimensions of chronic disease in Africa\nSub-Saharan Africa is the only region of the world in\nwhich infectious diseases still outnumber chronic dis-\neases as a cause of death. It is perhaps therefore an under-\nstandable misperception that chronic diseases are not an\nimportant contributor to the burden of disease. In fact, in\nadults, overall age specific mortality rates from chronic\ndiseases are higher, often several fold higher in younger\nadult age groups, than in most high income countries\n[15]. Even more surprising perhaps is that the available\ndata suggest that age specific mortality rates from chronic\ndiseases as a whole are actually higher in sub Saharan\nAfrica than in virtually all other regions of the world, in\nboth men and women [1]. In addition, there is increasing\nevidence for adverse interactions between some chronic\ndiseases and infectious diseases.\nThe first paper in this section, of Agyeman, Addo, Bho-\npal, de Graft Aikins and Stronks [16], provides a thorough\nreview of cardiovascular disease and its risk factors in\nAfrican origin populations. It finds that African origin\npopulations outside Africa tend to have high stroke mor-\ntality rates, with at least part of the explanation for these\nbeing high levels of hypertension and diabetes. Histori-\ncally, they have also tended to have a relatively favourable\nlipid profile, with for example, on average higher levels of\nprotective HDL cholesterol and lower levels of triglycer-\nide. This has been part of the explanation for lower levels\nof coronary heart disease in African compared to Euro-\npean origin populations. In the past, these differences in\nlipids between African and European origin populations\nhave been considered universal, and interpreted as an\nexample of genetic differences. However, this paper cau-\ntions against such generalisations, with examples of\nmigrant African populations where this and other charac-\nteristics typically associated with African origin popula-\ntions are not found. Undoubtedly environmental and\nbehavioural determinants are also very important, and\nthe relative balance of genetic and non-genetic factors in\nexplaining differences between populations of different\nancestries remains to be determined.\nThe paper by BeLue, Okoror, Iwelunmor, Taylor, Deg-\nboe, Agyemang and Ogedegbe [17], explores the socio-\ncultural contexts within which increasing risk of CVD is\ndeveloping in sub-Saharan Africa. Underlying, upstream,\ndeterminants include rapidly increasing urbanisation,\npoverty and lack of government programmes for the pre-\nvention of CVD and related chronic diseases. Some of the\nwell known more proximal behavioural and biological\ndeterminants are considered \"gendered\", with marked\ndifferences in their prevalence between men and women.\nSmoking, for example, tends to be much commoner in\nmen than women, whereas the opposite is true for obe-\nsity. A crucial perspective on understanding why some\nrisks are gendered, and indeed on the emergence of CVD\nrisk in general and what can be done to prevent it, is how\nculture shapes perceptions and experiences of risk and\ndisease. A model, known as PEN-3 [18], is described\nwhich provides a framework for examining health beliefs,\ndecisions and behaviours and assist with planning cultur-\nally appropriate interventions. Only if CVD risk is under-\nde-Graft Aikins et al. Globalization and Health 2010, 6:5\nhttp:\/\/www.globalizationandhealth.com\/content\/6\/1\/5\nPage 3 of 7stood through the lens of local communities, and is\naddressed with their involvement, is sustainable change\npossible. The crucial roles of communities in addressing\nthe chronic disease burden is considered further below,\nwhich highlights three other contributions relevant to\nthis area.\nRapidly increasing levels of CVD and diabetes in sub\nSaharan Africa are occurring alongside continuing high\nrates of infectious diseases. These two broad types of dis-\neases do not simply exist in parallel, but can actually\ninteract, one exacerbating the other. For example, diabe-\ntes increases the risk of developing active tuberculosis\n(TB), and the presence of diabetes in TB is associated\nwith poorer outcomes. So, increasing levels of diabetes in\npopulations that also have high levels of TB may compli-\ncate efforts at successful TB control and treatment.\nAnother example is the potential for anti retroviral ther-\napy (ART) to increase the risk of diabetes and other car-\ndiovascular risk factors, particularly lipid abnormalities.\nTherefore the successful roll out of ART may need to be\nlinked to efforts to prevent these adverse consequences,\nand where they do occur to provide appropriate treat-\nment. Young, Critchley, Johnstone and Unwin [2], discuss\nthese two examples and their implications in detail, and\nhelp to highlight the urgent need for new research on\nthese areas within sub Saharan Africa.\nPsychological dimensions of chronic disease in Africa\nChronic diseases cause disruptions to the physical capa-\nbilities, social identities and life trajectories of sufferers\n[19]. Studies on experiences of asthma, cancer, diabetes\nand sickle-cell anaemia in sub-Saharan Africa show that\nexperiences are characterised by depression [20-23],\n'chronic unhappiness' [24], spiritual distress [22], 'psychi-\natric disturbance' [25], and 'suicidal ideation' [22]. These\npsychological, emotional and spiritual disruptions can\noccur even within the context of strong family support\nand often undermine social and medical relationships\n[2,6] as well as illness management and self-care\n[20,22,26].\nThe WHO (2005) observes that \"chronic diseases can\ncause poverty in individuals and families, and draw them\ninto a downward spiral of worsening disease and poverty\"\n(p. 61). The downward spiral has psychological conse-\nquences. Poverty may intensify healershopping. A range\nof medical systems provide chronic disease care in many\nAfrican countries, including biomedical services, tradi-\ntional medicine and faith healing systems. Biomedical\nservices are often inaccessible to the poor and may be\nharmful at point of access due to lack of appropriate\nchronic disease expertise, medical supplies and equip-\nment. Alternative healers, who are often sought because\nthey may be cheaper and because they offer psychological\nand spiritual support that is lacking in formal biomedical\ncare, may also be medically harmful for similar reasons.\nThe medical complications that often ensue from healer-\nshopping maintain the vicious cycle of physical and psy-\nchological disruption [20,26].\nChronic disease management makes demands on the\ntime, emotions and physical capabilities of caregivers.\nIncreasing dependence on family and significant others\nfor medical care and self-care, particularly within con-\ntexts of poverty, can cause emotional conflict and break-\ndown in marital and intimate relationships, as well as\nfamily abandonment [20,27]. Finally, stigma is a signifi-\ncant psychological stressor. In many African countries,\nphysical chronic conditions such as diabetes, cancers and\nepilepsy and mental illnesses like schizophrenia and psy-\nchosis are stigmatised [26-28]. The different facets of\nstigma [29] and their consequences are documented.\nActual stigma leads to discrimination and ostracism of\npeople with aforementioned conditions. Courtesy stigma\nleads to discrimination of caregivers and significant oth-\ners of the chronically ill. Perceived stigma leads to self-\nimposed socially restricted lives for both groups.\nFour original papers in this special issue contribute to\nthe literature on the psychological impact of chronic dis-\nease. They underscore the importance of understanding\nand tackling this challenge through multi-level interven-\ntions that encompass medical, psychosocial, economic\nand, for stigmatised conditions, rights-based support.\nKolling, Winkley and von Deden present new anthropo-\nlogical data on diabetes experiences among the urban\npoor of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania [30]. They describe the\nintricate relationship between physical and psychological\ndisruption. They also show how poverty breeds a double\nburden of disease in households, such that adults living\nwith diabetes must make difficult choices between paying\nfor their own care and sacrificing their health needs for\nchildren living with infectious diseases. Anie, Egunjobi\nand Akinyanju, examine the psychosocial impact of sickle\ncell disorder in 408 adolescents and adults attending\nthree hospitals in Lagos, Nigeria [31]. Pain and disability\nare central features of sickle cell disease; sickle cell inter-\nventions prioritise pain management and encourage\nhome-based 'active coping skills'. However, this study\ndemonstrates that outcomes on pain management and\ncoping are complex and unpredictable: they are shaped\nby the interplay between culturally mediated health and\nsickle cell beliefs, mood, subjective evaluation of self-con-\ntrol and self-efficacy, and the quality and accessibility of\nhealthcare. Read, Adiibokah and Nyame present anthro-\npological work on Ghanaian rural experiences of severe\nmental illness [32]. These experiences are characterised\nby poor knowledge and understandings of mental illness,\nfamily stress and disruption, actual and courtesy stigma,\npoor formal mental healthcare and healershopping. The\nstudy highlights the way weak health systems and inade-\nde-Graft Aikins et al. Globalization and Health 2010, 6:5\nhttp:\/\/www.globalizationandhealth.com\/content\/6\/1\/5\nPage 4 of 7quate policies deepen the negative psychosocial impact of\nchronic mental illness for sufferers and their families, and\nunderscores the need for rights-based interventions.\nSimilarly, Skovdal and Ogutu's social psychological study\non Kenyan child carers of adults living with HIV\/AIDS\nhighlights the complex psychosocial course of caregiving\n[33]. Child carers experience daily physical, financial and\neducational disruptions. But the psychological impact of\ncare-giving varies among carers. Children evaluate their\nexperiences along a continuum of good coping to bad\ncoping depending on their unique circumstances and\npersonalities and access to resources. The authors\nemphasise that the development of interventions to sup-\nport child carers must take into account the way Kenyan\nchildren actively construct subjectivities and social iden-\ntities within the context of community health crisis.\nRole of communities in tackling chronic disease\nThe academic literature on chronic diseases in Africa\noften emphasises the top-down development of policy\nand the need to improve and expand medical services.\nHowever, most of the burden of care of the chronically ill\nis carried by patients' families, households and communi-\nties - even more so in rural areas which often lie beyond\nthe reach of policies and services.\nFurthermore the interaction between well-intentioned\npolicy and health services on the one hand, and patients\nand their families on the other is seldom a seamless pro-\ncess. Communities play a key role in shaping the lifestyle\ndecisions that drive chronic illness, and peoples' interpre-\ntations of and responses to pain and suffering [34]. Com-\nmunity networks play a key role in determining the\nsuccess of the diffusion of health-related knowledge from\nhealth professionals to vulnerable individuals [35]. Com-\nmunity-level norms and practices shape whether or not\npeople will make best use of medical services when these\nare available, in terms of appropriate access and optimal\nadherence to medical advice.\nThree papers make an important contribution to\nunderstandings of the need for community participation\nin efforts to build health-supporting social environments.\nDe-Graft Aikins, Boynton and Atanga provide a compre-\nhensive overview of the structural, community and indi-\nvidual dimensions of tackling chronic disease in Ghana\nand Cameroon [36]. They discuss the role of community\ninterventions in bridging the gap between 'social logic'\nand 'medical logic' regarding health and illness, and in\ncontributing to the vexing challenge of translating\nabstract health expertise and policy into effective practice\nin real social settings. They refer to the potential of pre-\nventive health interventions by grassroots community\nand faith-based organisations, and of patient-led self-help\nand advocacy groups for the chronically ill. They indicate\nthe 'knowledge broker' role of the mass media, and popu-\nlar community opinion leaders - locating these against\nthe backdrop of wider national and international policy\ninitiatives, and the cultural realities in which individual\npatients are located.\nRead, Adiibokah and Nyame's ethnographic study high-\nlights the immense suffering resulting from the chaining\nand beating of the chronically mentally ill in Ghana [32].\nThey demonstrate the chasm between international\nhuman rights discourses and Ghanaian human rights leg-\nislation on the one hand, and the grim realities of patients\nand their carers, often in remote and under-served set-\ntings, on the other. Individualistic and 'top down' concep-\ntualisations of human rights have little resonance in a\ncontext where most mentally ill people have no access to\nmedical treatment or support, and where chaining is\noften regarded as the only option available to families and\nhealers within a cultural context that prioritises the safety\nand moral integrity of the group over the individual. Less\nviolent treatment of the mentally ill is unlikely to evolve\nin the absence of proper community participation,\nincluding the bottom-up engagement of affected families,\nhealers and other players involved in methods such as\nchaining, and the development of viable local-level sup-\nport for the mentally ill and their families.\nSkovdal and Ogutu's study of coping responses by child\ncarers in western Kenya, highlights the limitations of top-\ndown support interventions that fail to take account of\nhow local child carers, their 'patients' and communities\nmake sense of and respond to the challenges of illness and\ncaring [33]. They criticise the knee-jerk tendency of many\ninternational agencies to unproblematically assume that\nchildren are damaged individuals in need of individual-\nlevel counselling. Whilst their study is not blind to the\nsuffering of many child carers, they conceptualise chil-\ndren's coping and resilience in terms of the availability of\ncommunity-level support and in terms of children's abil-\nity to access this support, rather than defining the chil-\ndren in terms of their individual mental health. Rather\nthan prioritising counselling services, efforts to support\nyoung carers should focus on providing communities\nwith the financial and social psychological support they\nneed to support child carers appropriately.\nThese papers, and that of BeLue et al described in the\nsection above on medical dimensions, make a compelling\ncase for community participation as an essential precon-\ndition for effective prevention, care and support of the\nchronically ill. There is an urgent need for health profes-\nsionals and policy makers to acknowledge this, and also\nto promote proper community consultation and involve-\nment through formal recognition of the vital role of com-\nmunity outreach skills and activities in the training and\njob description of medical and welfare personnel. Cur-\nrently many doctors, nurses and social workers are\ntrained in traditional one-to-one forms of communica-\nde-Graft Aikins et al. Globalization and Health 2010, 6:5\nhttp:\/\/www.globalizationandhealth.com\/content\/6\/1\/5\nPage 5 of 7tion with patients and clients [37]. Community outreach\nneeds to be identified as a core training specialisation in\nall health and welfare related education. Within health\nservices there needs to be formal ring-fencing of time and\nresources to enable proper community engagement to\noccur.\nNational and international dimensions of fighting chronic \ndisease\nInternational health agencies and national governments\nare beginning to recognize and confront the significant\nglobal burden of chronic diseases. The WHO has been\ninstrumental with its 2005 publication \"Preventing\nchronic disease: a vital investment\" which proposed that\nenough is known about the causes, prevention and treat-\nment of the major chronic diseases to inform strong\nadvocacy for changes in priority setting and reallocation\nof resources towards chronic disease prevention in devel-\noping countries [1]. Tobacco control efforts over the last\ndecade in Europe and America, for example, have dem-\nonstrated the utility of multi-faceted interventions - legis-\nlation, fiscal, and population-based interventions - for\nchronic disease health protection [38]. The WHO has\nemphasized their global goal of reducing chronic diseases\nby 2% every year between 2005 and 2015, thereby pre-\nventing 36 million deaths [39]. For most African, Asian\nand Latin American countries, the 2015 target is off\ntrack. Since 2007 the World Bank and a growing number\nof international agencies have joined the WHO in calling\nfor more resources devoted to chronic disease manage-\nment [40] and for coordinated effort by national leaders\nto strengthen chronic disease prevention and control\nefforts [41-44]. International non-governmental organi-\nzations have also increased their commitment to reduc-\ning the global burden of chronic diseases by fostering\ncollaborations with partners in the public and private sec-\ntors. For example the National Heart, Lung, and Blood\nInstitute (NHLBI), a component of the US National Insti-\ntutes of Health and UnitedHealth Group, one of the\nworld's largest health and wellbeing companies, have\nforged a collaboration to counter chronic diseases by sup-\nporting a collaborative global network of centres of excel-\nlence (COEs) in low-income and middle-income\ncountries [45]. The goal is to support research that will\ngenerate evidence to inform policy decisions. Further-\nmore, a campaign of 'international science advocacy' led\nby the Chronic Disease Action Group - a collaboration\nbetween The Lancet and scientists from WHO and a wide\nrange of countries - has contributed to the development\nof international health strategies since 2007 [44]. In an\nenlightening editorial on \"Chronic diseases and calls to\naction\" Shah Ebrahim (2008) noted that the real challenge\nfor any call to action is to develop and implement a plan\nfor achieving its goals [46]. Experts endorse plans and\npolicies that simultaneously address structural (including\npolicy, fiscal, industry and private businesses, interna-\ntional collaboration), community (including mass media,\nvoluntary organization, institutions, primary healthcare)\nand individual (including behavioural and pharmacologi-\ncal interventions) dimensions of chronic diseases [1,10].\nSouth Africa, Mauritius, Tanzania and Cameroon are\namong the few African countries that have responded to\nthe call for action [34]. However these countries have\nfocused on limited aspects of the ideal policy structure.\nIn the majority of countries, there is a gap between policy\nmakers' recognition of a national chronic disease burden\nand the development and implementation of chronic dis-\nease policies and plans.\nA major problem is a lack of political will. In this issue,\nde-Graft Aikins et al [34] highlight some factors that\nmaintain a lack of political will in Ghana, despite the fact\nthat some chronic diseases have been placed on the\nhealth ministry's priority intervention lists since the early\n1990s and a grassroots movement for chronic disease\nadvocacy exists. The factors include a fragmented\nchronic disease research community with limited power\nto influence policy and policymakers' overdependence on\ninternational health directives and funding in the devel-\nopment of local policies. The authors observe that other\ncountries with similar chronic disease profiles to Ghana\nare likely to face similar policy and political challenges.\nA second problem is a weak culture of knowledge\ntransfer. While African production of chronic disease\nresearch is extremely low compared to the rest of the\nworld, multidisciplinary research does exist on the epide-\nmiological, medical, socio-cultural and psychological\ndimensions of chronic diseases in the region. This limited\nbody of work provides important insights for practice and\npolicy. The challenge is in undertaking the sorts of analy-\nses that enable appropriate knowledge transfer and\nknowledge exchange based on extant research.\nReviews such as the special issue papers by Agyeman et\nal [16] on the risk factors for chronic diseases among the\nAfrican diaspora in Europe, by Belue et al [17] on the cul-\ntural dimensions of the CVD burden, and by Young et al\n[2] on the co-morbidity between infectious and chronic\ndiseases are a critical contribution towards an analysis of\nknowledge transfer. Agyeman et al [16] establish in their\nreview the risk factors for, and higher prevalence of,\nhypertension and diabetes in migrant African popula-\ntions in Europe compared to the host populations of the\ncountries of resettlement and populations in their home\ncountries. The implications are clear to the planning of\nservices for these minority groups within the context of\ntheir European host countries. The review also offers\ninsights on socio-cultural continuities and change within\nmigrant populations (e.g the area of dietary practices and\nphysical activity), which provide some lessons for African\nde-Graft Aikins et al. Globalization and Health 2010, 6:5\nhttp:\/\/www.globalizationandhealth.com\/content\/6\/1\/5\nPage 6 of 7policymakers. The paper emphasises the importance of\nconducting comprehensive reviews of the epidemiology\nof major chronic diseases in Africa to provide more con-\ncrete, context specific evidence for policy.\nBelue et al [17] provide an important perspective by\nfocusing on the cultural dimensions of CVD prevention,\ncontrol and treatment across the continent. In general\ndiscussions of the burden of chronic disease in non-west-\nern contexts, culture is either ignored or is treated merely\nas a barrier to medical adherence or good self-care. Yet as\nsome empirical papers in this issue suggest, fighting the\nchronic disease burden in Africa requires critical atten-\ntion to the way society and culture structure lay concepts\nof health, disease and specific chronic diseases, how prac-\ntical and existential responses to chronic disease experi-\nences develop and are sustained, and how social support\nand alternative healthcare systems are shaped by culture,\nreligion and contemporary economic forces. Policymak-\ners have to consider the extent to which the language,\ncontent and objectives of expert information and health\nservices reflect these socio-cultural contexts. Data and\ninsights from anthropological and psychological research\nare therefore crucial to the development of socio-cultur-\nally appropriate chronic disease policies.\nThe application of the knowledge of the pathophysiol-\nogy in co-morbidities of chronic diseases with chronic\ninfectious diseases such as HIV and TB is evident. Young\net al [2] review the evidence on the limited but compel-\nling data on the epidemiology of co-morbidities and the\nlikely effects of drug interactions. Knowledge transfer\nhere would need to take into account the need to\nstrengthen the capacity of African health systems to\naddress health financing in this area, to improve procure-\nment and access to medicines and to introduce multi-dis-\nciplinary working practices across areas of human\nresource specialisation for medical and social care.\nAlthough the literature from the social sciences was not\nincluded in the review, the authors touch on the potential\neffects of factors such as gender and poverty which would\nadd significant socio-cultural challenges to interventions\nin this area.\nConclusion\nThe evidence presented in this special issue on the medi-\ncal, psychological, community and policy dimensions of\nthe chronic disease burden in sub-Saharan Africa empha-\nsises the urgent need for primary and secondary inter-\nventions and for African health policymakers and\ngovernments to prioritise the development and imple-\nmentation of chronic disease policies. In addition, the\ncontributions in this issue help to identify gaps in the evi-\ndence that is needed to guide the development and\nimplementation of preventive interventions and policies.\nThese gaps fall in two broad categories. One category\nconcerns the need for multidisciplinary models of\nresearch, bringing together a range of perspectives,\nincluding cultural, psychological, epidemiological, clini-\ncal and economic, to properly inform the design of inter-\nventions that address the needs of communities and\nindividuals at risk of chronic diseases and their conse-\nquences. The second broad category of research, comple-\nmentary to the first, concerns understanding the\nprocesses and political economies of policy making in sub\nSaharan Africa. This is essential to be able to effectively\ninfluence the development and implementation of poli-\ncies supporting the prevention and care of chronic dis-\neases. Undoubtedly this will include gaining a better\nunderstanding of the economic impact of chronic dis-\neases within sub Saharan Africa. It will also include\nunderstanding better the relationships between national\npolicy making and international economic and political\npressures, which have a huge impact on the risk of\nchronic diseases and the ability of countries to respond to\nthem.\nAppendices\nAppendix 1\nChronic diseases are often referred to as 'non communi-\ncable diseases' to distinguish them from communicable\ndiseases and as 'diseases of lifestyle' to distinguish them\nfrom diseases with environmental causes. These terms\nignore the similarities between the categories: some non\ncommunicable diseases have infectious elements; dis-\neases of lifestyle also have causal elements in the environ-\nment. In this paper we adopt the WHO (2005) definition\nof 'chronic diseases' which refers to a set of conditions\nwith \"important shared features\" including: (1) \"chronic\ndisease epidemics take decades to become fully estab-\nlished - they have their origins at young ages\"; and (2)\ngiven their long duration, there are many opportunities\nfor prevention; and (3) they require a long-term and sys-\ntematic approach to treatment\" (p.35)\nAppendix 2\nVisit http:\/\/www.psych.lse.ac.uk\/chronicdiseaseafrica or\nclick Africa-UK Partnership at LSE Health http:\/\/\nwww2.lse.ac.uk\/LSEHealthAndSocialCare\/LSEHealth\/\nHome.aspx for more details on the UK-Africa Academic\nPartnership on Chronic Disease.\nAuthor Details\n1Department of Social and Developmental Psychology, Faculty of Politics, \nPsychology, Sociology and International Studies, University of Cambridge, \nCambridge, UK, 2Institute of Health and Society, University of Newcastle, \nNewcastle, UK, 3Department of Public Health, Academic Medical Centre, \nUniversity of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands, 4School of Medicine \nand Health Sciences, Monash University, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, 5Institute of \nSocial Psychology, London School of Economics and Political Science, London, \nUK and 6Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research, University of Ghana, \nAccra, Ghana\nde-Graft Aikins et al.
