Introduction\nThe fact that the magnetisation of a magnetic material can be controlled by an external magnetic\nfield is widely used in today\u2019s information technology. The manipulation of magnetisation by\nmeans other than magnetic field, for example electric field, could find applications in magnetic\nstorage, spintronics [1], and other magnetic sensing and actuating micro-electric-mechanical\nsystems (MEMS) devices [2]. Electrically-controlled magnetic switches have been reported\nrecently in the hole-induced ferromagnetic semiconductor (In,Mn)As [3] and the magnetic\nferroelectric compound HoMnO3 [4] via magnetoelectric interaction. However, both of these were\nobserved at very low temperatures (less than 25K). Recently, electrically tunable ferromagnetic\nresonance [5,6] via magnetoelectric (ME) interaction and the converse ME effect at low frequency\n[7] have been reported.\nThe ME effect is characterized by the appearance of an electric polarization on applying a magnetic\nfiled ( \u03b1=\u03b4P\/\u03b4H, called the MEH effect, or direct ME effect) or by the appearance of a\nmagnetization on applying an electric field (\u03b1=\u03b4M\/\u03b4E, called MEE effect, or converse ME effect). It\nwas foreseen by Landau and Lifshitz from thermodynamics and symmetry consideration [8] and\nwas first measured in a Cr2O3 crystal [9,10]. The ME effect in single phase materials is usually very\nsmall and often can only be realised at very low temperatures [11,12].\nThe ME effect can also be realised through product property [13]. Van Suchtelen proposed the\nproduct property concept whereby entirely new properties could be achieved by coupling a pair of\ntensor properties in two materials that were intimately mixed [13]. Since then two main processing\nroutes have been investigated to achieve ME effect this way, namely, (a) particulate\nmagnetostrictive (MS) and piezoelectric (PE) and (b) laminated MS\/PE composites. Investigations\non eutectic co-existing phases of spinel cobalt ferrite-cobalt titanate and perovskite barium titanate\nachieved magnetoelectric voltage coefficient \u03b1E = \u03b1\/\u03b50\u03b5r ~ 50 mV\/cm Oe despite theoretical\nestimation to be 40-60 times larger [14], where \u03b5r is the relative permittivity and \u03b50 the dielectric\nconstant of vacuum. Similar ME coefficient were obtained with particulate composites of the giant\nMS rare-earth-iron alloy Tb1-xDyxFe2 (TFD) and lead zirconate titanate (PZT) and PVDF polymer\n[15]. A recent investigation of CoFe2O4-BiFeO3 nanocomposites obtained \u03b1E as high as 280 mV\/cm\nOe [16]. On the other hand, laminated MS\/PE structures have been found to show much higher\nMEH coefficients. \u03b1E values of 1500 mV\/cm Oe for ferrite-PZT [17] and 4680 mV\/cm Oe for\nTFD\/PZT laminar structures [18] have been reported. Significant enhancement of MEH response\ncan be obtained when the modulation frequency of the applied fields coincides with magnetic,\nelectrical or mechanical eigenmodes of the system under study [19-21]. Here, we report the\ninvestigation of the direct and converse ME effects in composites at and off their mechanical\nresonant frequencies and the comparison between these measurement results and the theoretical\nmodelling.\n2. Experimental\nThe giant magnetostrictive rare-earth-iron alloy TFD (Gansu Tianxing Rare Earth Functional\nMaterials Co, China) and the piezoelectric PZT ceramics (Ferroperm Piezoceramics, PZ29) were\nused to make laminar sandwich structures TFD\/PZT\/TFD and PZT\/TFD\/PZT by epoxy bonding (\nEPOTEK 301-2) at 85\u00baC . Meso-scale samples, with total thickness of 1.262 mm were fabricated by\npolishing down the TFD and then cutting the laminated composites. The PZT thickness was 0.127\nmm, and the epoxy layer thickness was about 0.01 mm. The laminar was suspended between two\nthin Cu wires attached to the face centres. These two wires also served as two electrodes. This\nmounting allowed minimum physical clamping on the sample.\nThe direct ME effect was measured using an AC magnetic field generated from a Helmholtz coil as\ninput and measure the induced electric voltage across the PZT as the output. The characterisation of\nthe converse ME effect, namely, the electric voltage applied to the PZT as the input and the induced\nmagnetisation of the TFD as the output, was carried out using a set-up similar for the direct ME\nmeasurement, without the Helmholtz coil. A sinusoidal voltage was applied to the PZT, and the\ninduced AC magnetic field was measured by a pickup coil placed immediately outside the sample.\nTwo pickup coils placed at perpendicular directions at the same time were used for the three\ndimensional characterisation of the induced magnetisation field. The DC bias magnetic fields were\nprovided by a pair of electromagnet. For all measurements presented here, the AC and DC magnetic\nfields were parallel. At high frequency the inductance of the Helmholtz coil generates a\nprohibitively large voltage so for frequencies above 10kHz the inductance was tuned out by a\nseries variable capacitance. The total capacitance required to put the coils in resonance was\ncalculated from the inductance and resistance measured with RCL Bridge (Fluke, PM6306). For\nfrequencies below 10kHz the Helmholtz coil pair was driven directly. More experimental details can\nbe found elsewhere [22]. The longitudinal and transverse measurement configurations have been\ninvestigated, as schematically shown in Fig. 1.\n3. Results and Discussion\nFig. 2a shows typical ME response as a function of frequency at transverse configuration. At low\nfrequencies (<40KHz) the ME voltage coefficient \u03b1v = E\/H was almost a constant. The \u03b1v was\nfound to depend on the DC bias field, and had the highest value for the bias field around 400 Oe.\nThis is understandable since the ME coefficient is proportional to the MS coefficient q31, and q31\nreaches its maximum at Hdc around 350 Oe [23]. The \u03b1v had a sharp increase around the resonant\nfrequency. The nature of this resonance was dominated by mechanical effect, as can be confirmed\nfrom the following calculation: Let fr be the fundamental mechanical resonant frequency of the\nbonded structure, and assuming the bonding is perfect and had negligible thickness, then [24]\n(1)\nHere l=14.5mm was the sample length. Using material parameters Young\u2019s modulus Ytfd=4x1010\nNm-2, Ypzt=5.9x1010 Nm-2, volume fraction \u03bdtfd=0.9, \u03bdtpzt=0.1, density \u03c1tfd=9.2Kg m-3 and\n\u03c1pzt=7.46Kg m-3 it can be obtained fr =74.3KHz, which agrees well with the observed values.\nThe peak height of the \u03b1v at resonance was found to depend on the DC and AC magnetic fields, the\nsample orientation, as well as the particular sample (Fig.2b, another sample), a value up to \u03b1v =90 V\ncm-1Oe-1 has been observed at the resonance. The linearity between the voltage output across the\nPZT and the magnetic AC field applied to the TFD has been confirmed for both the low frequency\nand resonant responses. Unlike the low frequency response, the \u03b1v at resonance was found to\nincrease with the bias field up to Hdc=1000 Oe, which was the maximum bias field used in this\nexperiment. The \u03b1v was measured as 11.3 V cm-1Oe-1 at 70KHz at the DC bias 300 Oe. From Fig.\n1a curve\u2019s behaviours this suggested \u03b1v about 11.3\/3 = 3.8 V cm-1Oe-1 at low frequency (<40KHz).\nUsing equation (13) in Ref 25 and material parameters listed in the Table I, the calculated ME\nvoltage coefficient is \u03b1v=8.2 V cm-1Oe-1 which agrees well with the measured value.\nSimilar to the direct ME effect, the converse ME response was nearly a constant at low frequency\n(<40KHz), and the ME Oersterd coefficient [26] \u03b1H = M\/E was measured as 9 Oe cm\/KV\n(assuming \u03bcr=1) at 70KHz for a bias field of 300 Oe, here M is the induced magnetisation in the\nTFD and E the electric field across the PZT. The \u03b1H also peaked at the resonance frequency\n(79KHz) with a value of 50 Oe cm\/KV (Fig. 3). The theoretically calculated value is 19 Oe cm\/KV\nat low frequency (well below resonance) if the bonding is assumed to be perfect [26]. Both the\ntfdtfdPZTPZT\ntfdtfdPZT\nvv\nYvYv\nl\nf\npzt\nr\n\uf072\uf072 \uf02b\n\uf02b\uf03d\n2\n1\ncalculated and the measured values were more than 3 orders of magnitude larger than the value for\nCr2O3 for which the \u03b1H is no more than 41 x10-4 Oe cm\/KV.\nAnother interesting feature of the ME effect is the shift of the resonant frequency with the applied\nmagnetic bias field. Fig. 4 and Fig. 2 show the resonant frequency dependence on the bias field for\n(a) the longitudinal and (b) transverse configurations for different AC fields respectively. In the\nlongitudinal configuration, the sample's length, which was also the easy axis of the TFD was\nperpendicular to the DC and AC magnetic fields, the resonant frequency shifted lower\nmonotonically with the increasing bias field (Fig. 5a). When the sample was in the transverse\nconfiguration, the sample's length and therefore the easy axis was parallel to the DC and AC\nmagnetic fields. At small DC bias field, the resonant frequency decreased with the increasing field.\nHowever, at higher bias, it shifted up with the increasing bias (Fig. 5b). For the converse ME\nresponse (Fig. 3), the resonant frequency shift as a function of the magnetic bias field was similar to\nthose observed in the direct ME effect. This dependence of resonant frequency on the bias magnetic\nfield is consistent with the \u0394E effect, which is the dependence of the Young\u2019s modulus of the MS \nmaterials on the magnetic field. For MS materials, the strain produced by the MS effect adds to the\nstress-induced strain, so the material becomes softer when the magnetic moments are free to rotate.\nIt becomes increasingly stiff when approaching saturation and magnetic moment mobility\ndecreases. Squire [27] developed a phenomenological model for the \u0394E effect and we use this\nmodel to explain the above observed results.\nIn eqn (1), Ypzt and \u03c1pzt does not change with magnetic field since the PZT is not a magnetic\nmaterial, and vtfd, vpzt and \u03c1tfd do not change much since the volume change with magnetic field is\nclose to zero. Therefore, we can discuss the dependence of Ytfd on the magnetic field directly.\nAccording to Squire [27],\n),,()8\/9(1\n1\n2 \uf067\uf071\uf06c hFKYY\nY\nsss \uf02b\n\uf03d , here \u03bbs, Ys and K are respectively the MS\ncoefficient at saturation, Young\u2019s modulus at saturation and anisotropy energy density of the TFD.\nF(h, \u03b8,\u03b3) is a function of the reduced magnetic field h=H\u03bc0Ms\/2K, reduced strain energy \u03b3=3\u03bbs\u03c3\/4K,\nand wall angle \u03b8 between the easy axis and the external field direction. At the longitudinal\nconfiguration, \u03b8=90\u00b0, the magnetisation is by means of moment rotation only and its Young\u2019s\nmodulus decreases monotonically until saturation at h=1. At the transverse configuration, \u03b8=0\u00b0,  the \nmagnetisation is by means of domain wall movement only and its Young\u2019s modulus increases\nmonotonically with the increasing bias field. Squire\u2019s model has singularity at \u03b8=0\u00b0 so a small \u03b8\n(e.g. 15\u00b0) is used for the numerical calculation. Fig. 5c depicts the calculated Ytfd\/Ys as functions of\nthe reduced bias field for \u03b8=90\u00b0 (solid line) and \u03b8=15\u00b0 (dotted line). For our sample, the TFD was\nmost likely to be composed of both the \u03b8 =90\u00b0 and \u03b8=0\u00b0 domains at both the transverse and\nlongitudinal configurations, due to the existence of an internal stress developed during the cooling\nof the sandwiched structure to room temperature from the curing temperature (85\u00b0C). TFD has a\nmuch larger thermal expansion coefficient than the PZT, so at room temperature the TFD was\nunder tensile and the PZT under compressive stresses. Assuming \u03b1 is the thermal expansion\ncoefficient, then the stress:\n\u03c3= )()(\n)( 12\nTT\nYtYt\nYYt\ntfdpzt\npztpzttfdtfd\ntfdpztpzt \uf02d\uf02a\uf02d\uf02a\n\uf02b\n\uf02a\n\uf061\uf061\nusing \u03b1tfd=11x10-6 K-1, \u03b1pzt=2x10-6 K-1 , Ytfd=4x1010 Nm-2 , Ypzt=5.9x1010 Nm-2, ttfd=1.12 mm,\ntpzt=0.127 mm, T2=85 \u00b0C, T1=20 \u00b0C, we obtain \u03c3= 3.3 x 106 Nm-2. The stress induced magnetisation\ndue to the Villari effect in the TFD can then be obtained from Bj=qijTj. From the manufacturer\u2019s\ndata curve, this corresponds to 13.5KA\/m=170 Oe. The measured value (85 Oe) agrees well with\nthe above calculation. If we assume there were 80% and 20% of the \u03b8 =90\u00b0 and \u03b8 =0\u00b0 domains in\nthe longitudinal configuration and 20% and 80% in the transverse configuration, respectively, the\ncalculated Ytfd\/Ys as functions of the reduced bias field are depicted in the Fig. 5c as the dashed line\nand broken line respectively. These two profiles agree qualitatively well with our experimental\nobservations.\n4. Summary\nLaminar piezoelectric-magnetostrictive composites using piezoelectric lead zirconate titanate and\nthe giant magnetostrictive rare-earth-iron alloy Terfenol-D were prepared using epoxy bonding. The\ndirect and converse magnetoelectric (ME) effects at and off the mechanical resonant frequency\nwere characterized and compared to theoretical modelling. The mechanical resonant frequency of\nthe composites was observed to depend on the sample orientations as well as the magnetic DC bias\nfield. In the longitudinal configuration, the magnetic easy axis of the TFD was perpendicular to the\nDC and AC magnetic fields, the resonant frequency shifted down monotonically with the\nincreasing bias field. When the sample was in the transverse configuration, the easy axis of the\nTFD was parllel to the DC and AC magnetic fields, the resonant frequency decreased with the\nincreasing field initially. However, at higher bias field, it shifted up with the increasing bias. A\nphenomenological model based on \u0394E effect of magnetostrictive materials is proposed to explain \nthe observed phenomena.\nAcknowledgement\nThis work was financially supported by the UK EPSRC Grants GR\/R92448, EP\/D506638\/1 and\nEP\/C519426\/1.\nReferences\n[1] G.
