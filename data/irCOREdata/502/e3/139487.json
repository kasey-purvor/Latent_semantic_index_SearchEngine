Switzerland has the\nlargest market share for fair trade produce (mainly due small market sizes and high\nincome), but according to the Fairtrade Foundation (FtF), the UK is the largest physical\nmarket, worth \u00a3140 million sales in 2004, with large year on year growth (46% in 2003,\n52% 2004). In line with the sales growth, the number of participant organisations have\nalso grown significantly from less than 20 having signed a Fairtrade Foundation licensing\nagreement in 2000, to nearly 150 in 2006.\n3Utilising an in-depth longitudinal method within fair trade organisations, this research\nbuilds a robust model of the changes in the fair trade industry in the UK. The paper\nintegrates both existing literature and research from this study to identify a common set\nof definitions for both the participants and different eras within the UK fair trade\nindustry. It then identifies the implications of these different eras for the fair trade\nparticipants and industry in general. It culminates with a review of where industry\nparticipants see the future of fair trade within the UK. This provides the first empirical\nsupport for conceptualisation about the mainstreaming of fair trade (Moore, 2004,\nNicholls and Opal, 2005) and indicates some practicalities concerning the growth of fair\ntrade in other geographies, particularly in Anglo-Saxon cultures where fair trade shows\nsigns of following the same progression.\nMainstreaming of Fair Trade\nPrior to the year 2000 (the beginning of this research project), very little had been written\nabout fair trade in academia. Most work focused on ethical consumerism (Strong, 1996,\n1997; Shaw, 2000; Bird and Hughes, 1997). Since 2000 the volume of research on fair\ntrade has expanded covering areas as diverse as tourism (Cleverdon and Kalisch, 2000),\nmarketing networks (Tallontire, 2000), retailing (Nicholls, 2003) and social auditing\nsystems (Dey, 2000, 2003). However the largest growth of research has been on changes\nto the industry as it develops a mainstreaming approach to fair trade products. Table 1\nsummarises the contribution of the key papers and books in this area.\nTable 1: Current literature on the Eras of fair trade\n4As table 1 shows there has been some consideration of the mainstreaming of fair trade\nbut predominantly these contributions have been normative, based on secondary data or\non limited primary data. As such they have yet to provide sufficient evidence of\nmainstream fair trade with limited definitions and a focus on the critique of reasons for\nand impact of mainstreaming. In this paper we therefore provide more advanced\ndefinitions and critique of mainstreaming in fair trade, and are able to explore this further\nto investigate participants\u2019 opinions on the future for fair trade in the UK.\nAuthor Eras Identified Methods\nTallontire\n(2000)\nFour periods in ATO trade relationships with producers:\nGoodwill Selling (1950s-1970s) \u2013 Supporting initiatives by producers\nSolidarity Trade (1970s-1980s) \u2013 demonstrating solidarity with\nproducers\nMutually Beneficial Trading (1990s) \u2013 direct trading roots to\ndemonstrate mutual benefit for producers and consumers\nTrading Partnerships (late 1990s) \u2013 Set criteria and using trade to\nfund development\nPrinciple single case study\nof Caf\u00e9direct with some\ninterviews and secondary\ndata sources\nDavies and\nCrane (2003)\nProgression from alternative trade to commercialization in\norganizational decision-making\nSingle Case study of Day\nChocolate Company\nMoore (2004) Discusses from both the producer and consumer perspective a review\nof the historical ATO based trade to a broader mainstreaming of\nfair trade produce\nNormative \u2013 setting out a\nresearch agenda but based\non extensive personal\nexperience\nGolding and\nPeattie (2005)\nIdentifies the increased commercialization of fair trade through\nTallontire\u2019s Goodwill Selling and then commercialization\nmoving to a hypothesized third phase.

This phase\nwas principally supplier driven\nPhase two: Product Focus \u2013 repositioning fair trade on quality and\nlifestyle choice.

It was therefore deemed appropriate to follow an exploratory line of enquiry, to\ndevelop new insights into this under researched area. This research context required\ndeveloping theory through an unstructured approach (Miles and Huberman, 1994),\nallowing theory to emerge from the research data (Glaser, 1992). A qualitative, inductive\nresearch design was adopted using a participant observation methodology focused on\nobservation, interviews and document analysis. The main research objective was to\nunderstand of how fair trade companies manage and implement strategies to be both\nprofit making and maintain a strong fair trade brand,\nThe UK fair trade market is ideal to develop an understanding in this area for two\nreasons. Firstly, the UK has arguably outpaced most other countries in relation to the\ndevelopment of a commercially focused fair trade industry. As such, an analysis of the\nmarket in the UK can be used to inform other countries that are further behind in the\nmarkets\u2019 evolution. Secondly, the UK brands are beginning to expand into emerging\nmarkets such as North America, bringing their markets more in line with the UK\nperspective. Therefore the UK was deemed the most appropriate research context for\ninvestigating market trends in fair trade.\nParticipant observation was conducted over three years, amounting to 500 hours\nparticipant observation and used to inform 42 inductive interviews with 32 participants\n(Interviewee codes Caf\u00e9direct(CD), Day(DC) and Equal Exchange (EE)). A semi-\n6structured interview approach was taken to both obtain an appropriate level of\ncomparability and allow unobstructed narrative.\nTo ensure internal validity and reliability, a constant comparative method borrowed from\ngrounded theory (Barnes, 1996) was used, where actions and responses of multiple\nparticipants within the same organisations were compared against each other, the field\nnotes and secondary sources. In line with Rubin and Rubin (1995) data sources were\ninterpreted collectively to abstract underlying rationales from them and promote theory\ngrounded in the data. External validity and reliability was increased through triangulation\nwith both secondary sources and substantiative interviews with appropriate third parties.\nThis led to a further 12 interviews (Interviewee codes, Fairtrade Foundation (FtF),\nTraidcraft (TC), One World Shops(OWS), Christian Aid(CA), CRG(CO), Twin\nTrading(TW), Sainsbury\u2019s (SA) Producer organisations (PR)) from across the industry\nand provided significant substantiation for data collected within the companies. Analysis\nwas carried out through an inductive process using the tools developed for analysing\ngrounded theory research as synthesised by Spiggle (1994).\nResults\nThis paper provides three significant contributions which we will investigate in the three\nsections below. Firstly definitions for key participants are identified providing a bedrock\nfor further theoretical discussion. Secondly, consolidations of the eras of fair trade are\nidentified, and furthered thirdly, by providing an analysis of the strategic changes in the\nindustry and organisations involved in fair trade.\n7The Mass Marketing of Fair Trade\nSince fair trade\u2019s original conception in the UK, in the 1960\u2019s, and especially since its\nmore formal status, in the early 1990\u2019s, fair trade has grown significantly and developed a\ngreater market orientation. A distinction must be made regarding the different product\ncategories available due to differences in the discernable trends. In principle the market\ncan be dissected into two broad product groups: the Craft and Commodity related\nproducts. These predominantly differ in relation to the fair trade accreditation they carry.\nThe craft sector, (including toys, furniture, books etc.) does not have a universal auditing\nand labelling infrastructure and is run by small organisations and charities. The fair trade\nguarantee is therefore based on the reputation of the organisations involved on a trust, or\norganisation \u201cname\u201d basis (Moore, 2004). Conversely, the commodity sector, relating to\npredominantly beverages and food stuffs, is principally independently audited by the\nFairtrade Labelling Organisation (FLO)1 which charges a small fee for auditing purposes\nand awards a mark to successful brands (owned by \u201cLicensees\u201d). Nevertheless, some\norganisations producing commodity products chose to self-accredit fair trade status.\nResults - Fair trade participants\nThe distinction between the active participants of fair trade has not been fully described\nin literature to date. For instance, Nicholls and Opal (2005) identify some of the groups\ninvolved in fair trade such as alternative trading organisations (ATOs) and charities.\nTheir definitions can be problematic from a practical perspective however, as with ATOs.\nNichols and Opal (2005) include both religious based organisations and organisations\n1 The independent auditors for fair trade commodity products internationally (FLO). Their UK wing is\ncalled the Fairtrade Foundation (FtF)\n8with the aim of \u2018offering products the opportunity to trade in the developed world for the\nfirst time, without the control of middlemen\u2019 (p.20), as well as fair trade companies such\nas Caf\u00e9direct and Day Chocolate Company within the scope of the ATO definition. In\nfact they describe the fair trade companies as mainstream product categories launched by\nATOs, which, although historically the companies were set up by money from ATOs,\nthey are companies not products, and have significantly different aims. Further, Nicholls\nand Opal (2005) identify a significant number of organisations not falling under this\ncategory, such as Costa Coffee and Sainsbury\u2019s, but do not expand on the commonality\nbetween these organisations. Therefore, these definitions are too limited to understand the\nprocess of fair trade. The research in this study identifies five specific participant groups\nof organisation involved in the marketing of fair trade products.\n- Fair trade authorities include FLO, FtF and The International Federation for\nAlternative Trade (IFAT), these organisations oversee fair trade and audit related\norganisations, often awarding licences to carry marks of certification. They do not trade\nin fair trade products like the other four participants.\n- Fair trade ATOs are not-for-profit organisations which have taken a significant\nrole in fair trade development. This term is being used to cover both charities and ATOs\nsuch as Oxfam, World Development Movement and Twin Trading. These organisations\ngenerally work closely with producer communities to improve standards of work and\nliving. Their purpose in fair trade is using products to create awareness of developing\nworld poverty and pushing any residual profit back into the communities in which they\nwork. They are not profit driven.\n9- Fair trade companies including Caf\u00e9direct, Day, Equal Exchange etc. They are\norganisations set up with a specific fair trade agenda \/ ideology to undertake logistics and\nmarketing of fair trade products for profit. The companies focus specifically on fair trade\nproducts and have little if any products not of fair trade origin. They are typically\nclassified as ATOs, but require separate consideration because they are companies, set up\nwith specific commercial and ideological objectives, and as such have a duel\norganisational purpose of:\n1. Increasing sales volume \/ profit and\n2. Ideological purpose (shared by many fair trade organisations including those in\nthis study) based on two principles:\na. Having close relationships with fair trade licensed developing world\nproducers and assisting in their growth through higher prices and\ncommunity projects\nb. Influencing change in the current market system to improve conditions\nand income across the entire market\nTable 2 demonstrates both the formal written organisational purposes of the three main\ncase organisations in this study as well as the interpreted organisational purpose as\nespoused by the interview participants.\nTable 2: Case Company Missions\nCompany No. Employees Mission Interpretation of Missions\nEqual\nExchange\n5-8 Demonstrate alternative trading\nthrough relationships\nAssist the developing through\nbuilding relationships\nCaf\u00e9direct 20-30 Pioneer fair trade into mainstream to\nmaximize sales and therefore grower\nincome\nIncrease volumes to pass\nmore money back to growers\nDay 10-12 Demonstrate successful Alt. Trading to\ndrive change in cocoa industry and pass\nprofits back to growers\nIncrease volumes to improve\nour profits we then share with\ngrowers\n10\n- Fair trade adopters are organisations that existed prior to fair trade coming to\nthe businesses consciousness, but have since been significant adopters of the ideological\nprinciples as demonstrated in the second of the organisational purposes of fair trade\ncompanies above. Adopters are predominantly organics companies that offer fair trade\nproducts within their range and include Green and Blacks, Clipper and Percol.\n- Fair trade branders including Sainsbury\u2019s, Fyffes and Nestl\u00e9 are companies\nwho predominantly deal in non-fairtrade marked products but have fair trade as a brand\nextension to a pre-existing line of products. They are unlikely to be significant adopters\nof the fair trade principles across their business, but have produced own label fair trade\nproducts to capitalise on the market growth. Unique to these organisations is that they\nalready had significant market share in the traditional mainstream market segments where\nfair trade began to appear and were initially hostile to fair trade initiatives, but as the\nmarket grew identified a growth potential in the market or a threat to existing sales. For\nexample, one major supermarket stated in 1994 that \u201conly vicars would be mad enough to\nbuy [fair trade] products\u201d (The Observer, 2006), but now have their own brand of fair\ntrade. Similarly in 1998 Nestl\u00e9 led a consortium of the dominant coffee companies\nagainst the government who were in support of the fair trade initiative Coffee Challenge,\nwhere the government\u2019s definition of fair trade was labelled as \u201cflawed\u201d (CBI in The\nGuardian, 1998, p.22) and coffee challenge was considered \u201cmisleading, misguided and\nunprecedented\u201d (British Soluble Coffee Manufacturers\u2019 Association, in The Guardian,\n1998, p. 22). However by 2006 Nestle created their first fair trade brand based not on any\nideological belief about the benefits of fair trade but on their ability to sell it.\n11\n\u2018\"We researched the market and we found that there are consumers out there who are very\ninterested in development issues that are probably not currently buying a Fairtrade product,\nand they would be attracted into this market by the strength of the Nescafe brand\u201d, says\nHilary Parsons, head of Partner's Blend Project at Nestle UK\u2019 (BBC website, 2006)\nLastly, Cadburys\u2019 recent purchase of a significant stake in fair trade adopter Green and\nBlack is contrary to their 2002 statement:\n\u2018\"We do not believe it is possible to manipulate or regulate the market for a crop that is\nproduced in many different countries and consumed in many different markets,\" the\ncompany says. \"In addition, the majority of cocoa farms are small family-owned operations\nin rural areas. They are not part of a co-operative group and are therefore unable to benefit\nfrom the fair trade system. Fair trade accounts for less than 0.1pc of all cocoa produced,\nwith the actual economic benefit to farmers therefore being very limited.\u2019 (Cadbury\u2019s\nSchweppes (The Daily Telegraph, 2002))\nClearly these \u2018branders\u2019 have little link with the second organisational purpose of fair\ntrade companies and use fair trade solely as a vehicle for either protecting or building\nmarket share.\nDefinition Summary\nThe latter four types range across the spectrum from fair trade ATOs to fair trade\nbranders, dependant upon whether and to what degree the purposes of their involvement\nin fair trade are driven by ideological or volume purposes Figure 1 illustrates the\nrelationship between the four types of organizations found in this study. We then see the\nnon-trading fair trade authorities and their sphere of influence over the fair trade industry.\n[Take in Figure 1]\n12\nResults - The Eras of Fair Trade\nThis study resulted in a four era model of fair trade, expanding on the previous models,\nand provision of a clear empirical foundation for the proposition of the mass-marketing\nof fair trade. Table 3 identifies these eras and summarises the topics discussed throughout\nthe paper.\n[Take in Table 3 \u2013 see end of paper]\nPrior to 1990 fair trade was focused on the dissemination of information about poverty\nand the crippling nature of market prices on many producers in developing countries.\nThis period of solidarity with the developing world (Tallontire, 2000) was driven by\ncharities and campaigning organisations, and can be termed the solidarity era of fair\ntrade (~1970-1990). However, since the inception of fair trade labelling through the\nFLO, and in the UK the FtF, most other organisations already involved in fair trade\nbecame more commercially and business orientated. Therefore, they attempted to sell\nmore fair trade products as a means to assist the producers in developing countries and\nincreasing consumer awareness as a result. At the same time a group of specialist profit\nseeking fair trade companies became established, aiming to create a profit from a core\ngroup of ethical consumer, this is termed the niche market era of fair trade (~1990-2002).\nMore recently however the number of companies becoming involved in fair trade has\nexpanded, where the principle focus is on becoming a leading brand in markets. This is\ntermed the mass-market era of fair trade (~2002-) (Davies and Crane, 2003, Moore, 2004\nand Renard, 2003b). Finally, we discuss a hypothetical fourth era of fair trade as\n13\ndiscussed by participants where craft products also begin a process of mainstreaming,\nalternative authorities emerge and greater numbers of mainstream organisations adopt fair\ntrade as a brand extension to existing lines. As a consequence, the meaning and principles\nof fair trade will over time become partially lost as customers begin to assume fair trade\nruns across all product ranges from companies with fair trade brands. Therefore from the\ncustomers\u2019 perspective, fair trade becomes institutionalised as a pre-requisite to trading in\nthe industry, regardless of the extent to which this has happened.\nThe Solidarity Era (1970 \u2013 1990)\nIndustry structure and participants - During the solidarity era, craft products provided\nthe bulk of sales. Sold predominantly through mail order, as with Traidcraft or in not-for-\nprofit and charity shops, such as Oxfam or specialist ATOs. Religious groups such as\nchurches were also targeted with presentations and small church shops distributing\nproduce. The industry was generally unregulated despite the creation of some fair trade\nauthorities (Figure 2) and the fair trade guarantee was based purely on the \u201cname\u201d of the\nATO involved. Campaign organisations and ATOs worked closely both together and in\ngrower communities making a direct link between producers and customers in the\ndeveloped world. ATOs often had vertical integration all the way from purchasing\nproducts through to retailing in specialist stores or through mail order. As such it was a\nsimple industry structure with the focus heavily skewed towards meeting producer rather\nthan consumer needs.\n[Take in Figure 2]\n14\nOrganisational Purpose, Strategy and Marketing \u2013 The purpose of ATOs in this era\nwas heavily orientated to \u201clobbying and awareness raising\u201d (TC1) about poverty in the\nunder-developed world. Many organisations, such as Campaign Coffee, were run by\nvolunteers with close links to Voluntary Service Overseas (VSO) or similar initiatives.\nTraidcraft, Oxfam and Twin Trading were some of the bigger organisations but were not\nrun on a purely voluntary basis. However the focus of all the organisations\u2019 was viewed\nby participants as showing their solidarity with the producers.\nProducts were undifferentiated, and the ATOs aimed to \u201csell whatever they could source\u201d\n(DC2) rather then identifying a market to serve. This product orientation had two knock\non effects for the market. Firstly, customers soon bored of the limited choice \u2013 DC6\nreminisced about receiving the mail order catalogues and thinking \u201cgosh! another basket,\nhow are you going to sell this\u201d, and secondly quality was often poor with little or no\nquality control. For instance 1980\u2019s fair trade coffee \u201ctasted awful but the product was a\nvehicle for raising awareness not a consumer product\u201d (EE1). Products were therefore\nsecondary to the values they represented and aimed at a limited market niche of\nindividuals wishing to show support for the ATO\u2019s work in underdeveloped countries\n(Tallontire, 2000).\nA limited number of the commodity products such as coffee became available which\npromoted a \u201cpolitical message\u201d (EE1) predominantly over branding, quality or mass-\nmarket appeal. As such they came in plain, unbranded packaging with leaflets and\ninformation for consumers on developing world issues. Participants recall the Solidarity\n15\nEra of fair trade as a campaigning period, providing limited numbers of products, aimed\nat raising awareness to social issues such as poor living standards, in regions of the\nunderdeveloped world.\nThe Niche Market Era (1990-2002)\nIndustry structure and participants \u2013 During the niche market era, unbranded craft\nproducts continued to be developed and grow in sales through world shops across the\nUK. The craft products remained relatively unbranded, but were commonly sold by for-\nprofit organisations as well as the charity shops such as Oxfam. One key change was a\nreview of the supply chains of products going into fair trade shops through BAFTS\n(British Association of Fair Trade Shops) and IFAT (figure 3). Although not using a label\nas such, the associations worked to facilitate the flow of information and a set of self-\nassessment guidelines necessary for membership to the bodies. For example, IFAT is a\nworldwide membership organisation, consisting of approximately 110 producers of crafts\nand 50 buying organisations, which it brings together to trade and share information\n(IFAT, 2003). The guarantee of fair trading, however, is still based on what Moore\n(2003) refers to as the \u201cname\u201d of the ATO. Since an independent audit of the suppliers\ndoes not occur, the ATO\u2019s reputation is the only consumer guarantee of a product\u2019s fair\ntrade status.\n[Take in Figure 3]\nIn the commodity sector one of the revolutionary moments in fair trade was created with\nthe explosion and later consolidation of national fair trade initiatives and labelling.\nFollowing on from the Max Havelaar Mark as created in the solidarity era, a number of\n16\nnational initiatives began to emerge in different countries, with the similar aim of\nauditing, accrediting and labelling fair trade commodities (Figure 3). The separate\nnational bodies then identified a united set of fair trade principles and formed the FLO in\n1997 to oversee the accreditation of the labels to farmers and importers, leaving the\nconsumer guarantee of fair trade status to national bodies.\nThrough this labelling initiative it became easier for smaller organisations without a well-\nknown reputation to provide a guaranteed fair trade product. As such there was a growth\nin both the number of companies and number of products available on the market.\nCaf\u00e9direct was created just before labelling commenced in the UK but was one of the\nfirst brands to really gain the advantages of labelling. Despite being set up by a number\nof ATOs with good reputations, carrying a guaranteed label facilitated sales of its\nproducts regardless of consumer knowledge about its ownership structure. Labelling also\nfacilitated the emergence for many other fair trade companies such as Day and Agrofair\nand fair trade adopters such as Green and Blacks, Clipper Teas and Gerber Juice (Fruit\nPassion).\nWith the increase in participants, the distribution of fair trade also increased, especially\nwithin supermarkets, who stocked fair trade for the first time in 1994 (figure 3). At the\nend of the niche market era we also see the first own label fair trade brands from the likes\nof Co-operative Retail Group (CRG) and Starbucks. This in turn led to an increasing\nmarket for both crafts and commodities through online sales and a reduction in\nrepresentatives as the primary vehicle for sales and distribution. The niche market era\n17\nwas therefore one of growth in product volumes, distribution and participation,\nprincipally driven by the changes in organisational purpose.\nOrganisational Purpose, Strategy and Marketing \u2013 in the niche market era there is a\nsignificant expansion in the distribution and availability of fair trade commodity\nproducts. Driving this move was the emergence of companies focused on providing\nhigher quality products to meet customers\u2019 expectations and provide sales volume rather\nthan communicating a particular, political message. They moved away from the former\nsolidarity basis of early fair trade to compete in the \u201cmass-market against leading product\ncategory brands\u201d (EE1). With the ownership and guidance of the existing ATOs, new fair\ntrade companies such as Caf\u00e9direct and Day, emerge. Simultaneously, a limited number\nof fair trade adopters such as Clipper and Green and Blacks began producing fair trade\nbrands. ATO\u2019s such as Equal Exchange also began to refocus their organisational\npurpose towards a commercial approach from the former campaigning position.\n\u201cAs the charities started to take on trade campaigns we had to refocus\u2026 The business was\ntaking up more and more time and we couldn\u2019t go on as volunteers. We had to change and\nfocus more on volumes and making a profit to ensure we could do this for a living.\u201d (EE1)\nThese new organisations and even existing organisations began to make fair trade about\ntrade, not campaigning. ATOs such as Oxfam and Traidcraft began to expand the lines of\nproducts they had on offer from crafts into commodities and expanded distribution. The\nnew companies and adopters were not supported by donations like the charities and had\nto make a profit to survive. This was the emergence of profit \/ volume driven\norganisations (Purpose 1). Sales volume became essential in terms of both creating\n18\nprofits and as the means of achieving the second purpose - assisting the developing\nworld. However this did not go without producing conflict in the industry between the\nold and new methods of fair trade:\n\u201cThere was back when Caf\u00e9direct started in mid 1990\u2019s a definite battle within the fair\ntrade movement, that what was important for the [purist] fair traders was that fair trade was\nto be alternative trade the whole way through and only sold in alternative shops. This is fine\nand dandy if you have ten nut producers and want to sell one bag of nuts but not if you want\nto increase your sales.\u201d (DC2)\nThe marketers won the day, but despite this movement away from the ideological\nfoundations of the ATOs, they remained key participants through both ownership of\nmany fair trade companies and movement of employees from the ATOs to the\ncompanies. As such the new participants still view fair trade from a political position, but\nusing fair trade products and market pressure through sales, to leverage the current\neconomic system (Purpose 2) rather than lobbying and campaigns. For example, DC1\ncomments on Day attempting to \u201cchange the chocolate market\u201d through sales volume,\nCD2 discusses the objective of \u201cenhancing lifestyles\u201d in the developing world through\nincreased sales and EE3 discusses Equal Exchange as being \u201can example to the market\nplace of a successful alternative way for conducting trade relations\u201d. The ideolgical\npurpose of fair trade was therefore still strong in fair trade companies despite the ruffled\nfeathers of some of the purists. The move towards commerciality had begun, despite the\nstrong remnants of the ideological purpose.\nThe underlying core of ideological values is seen in many of the business functions of the\nniche market period. Joint Ventures between companies were limited to partners who had\n19\na \u201cproven track record in fair trade\u201d (DC1). As such the only joint ventures in the niche\nmarket era are between ATOs, fair trade companies and adopters with long standing\ncommitments to fair trade, e.g. Equal Exchange and Twin Trading (Jams), Twin and The\nBody Shop (Day Chocolate Company) and Day and the Co-operative Retail Group (see.\nDavies and Crane, 2003). Suggestions of working outside of these groups, with\nMcDonalds or Walmart (ASDA in the UK) were quickly discarded. In particular it is\nnoteworthy that Day was reticent to enter into a joint venture with Sainsbury\u2019s in 2001,\n\u201cThat really could undermine our position. So I think we would have to see about that. Would\nit corrode our sales. our ethics, was it a growing sector? \u2026 We have to ask ourselves what\ntheir intentions are, and is that a justifiable thing to be doing?\u201d (DC1)\nYet by 2003 (in the mass-market era), Day were the suppliers of Sainsbury\u2019s own label\nfair trade chocolate. As such the niche market era was a period of commercial growth\nlimited by ideological objectives.\nThis limiting of the growth had its knock on effect onto products. Although of higher and\nmore consistent quality and sold as brands, the commodity products were both branded\nand marketed in a way that limited their market appeal. A review of the advertising\nhistory on any of these companies (see especially www.caf\u00e9direct.co.uk advertising\nhistory pages) provides a valuable insight into the marketing approaches used in this\nperiod. Particularly in relation to the use of producer testimonials and a focus on poverty\nas the key brand message. As such the mediums used for marketing focused on customers\nwith existing political purchasing or gift giving agendas through alternative media like\npublic meetings, ethical trade press, charity mailing lists and church groups.\n20\nMass-market Era of Fair Trade (2002 - )\nIndustry Structure and Participant \u2013 in the mass-market era the industry structure in\nboth craft and commodity markets remained relatively similar to the niche market era\n(see figure 3) with three changes. In craft markets there is a move towards standardising\nan audit and certification system with IFAT developing a fair trade craft labelling\nscheme. The other major industry structure change is the increase in independent retailers\nsuch as newsagents, independent grocers and service sector organisations (coffee shops,\ncinemas, restaurants etc.) encompassing fair trade products in their ranges. There has also\nbeen a proliferation of distribution through other channels such as caterers, in company\ncanteens and airlines (MyTravel Northern Europe and First Choice). As such the market\nis becoming open to universal distribution rather than specific channels providing the\nonly market outlets.\nAs for participants, the biggest sector for growth in the mass market era has been the\nemergence of fair trade branders, in particular supermarket own branding with\nSainsbury\u2019s and Tescos and new entrants from traditional product market leaders like\nNestl\u00e9. Allowing large companies to carry fair trade is a critical turning point because the\noriginal principles of the Authorities (particularly the Fairtrade Foundation) were to:\n\u201cprovide a certification mark to small and medium sized organisations with a particular\ninterest in the developing world. We would not award licenses to a major brand or\nmultinational company because we can\u2019t control that and we would struggle to believe that\nthey were actually interested in the long term development of fair trade\u201d (FtF1 in 2000)\nThe original own labellers diverted this by using the existing licensees such as Day to sit\nas a middleman holding the licence and ensuring the fair trade status of products.\n21\nStarbucks was probably the first large, non-ATO organisation to be awarded the mark.\nThis was achieved by working with Transfair (FLO representative in the USA) to convert\ntheir existing suppliers towards fair trade principles. Since that time however, other\norganisations have been awarded licenses to carry the fair trade mark by purchasing\nexisting quantities of fair trade produce on the open market. Therefore one of the original\nprinciples of the FLO\/FtF has been modified to match the changing demands of the\nmarket. The threat of large organisations self-accrediting or using alternative labelling\ninitiatives (such as the Rainforest Alliance Mark in coffee) has forced FLO to lessen the\nthreat from competing initiatives. As such the emergence of new large fair trade branders\nand threat from competing authorities are key changes to the industry structure and\nparticipants.\nOrganisational Purpose, Strategies and Marketing \u2013 in the mass-market era of fair\ntrade most of the fair trade companies and existing fair trade adopters began to broaden\ntheir marketing focus. In this period there is an identifiable re-branding by many major\nparticipants. For example, Caf\u00e9direct re-branded their instant coffee from Caf\u00e9direct to\n\u201c5065\u201d and accompanied this with evocative branding, marketing and a reduction in the\nsize of the fair trade mark and grower comments. Similar initiatives were undertaken by\nClipper, Equal Exchange and Day, ATOs such as Traidcraft \u201cidentify brand as the future\nfor fair trade\u201d (TC1) and employed marketing consultants to revolutionise their\nmarketing activities. The rationale for all of this re-branding activity was the realisation\nthat:\n\u201c[T]o grow the markets as much as possible to maximise the benefits to farmers and\nespecially for [Caf\u00e9direct] now are 10 years old, they have hit a market share that is 4-5%\n22\n\u2026which would suggest that they, on the information that is currently available, have hit the\ntop of their core market. Core ethics can only get you to 3%. And therefore to go off and\ngrow the market above that you need to hit the much more brand aware customer. You\nknow, not bad customers but not based on core ethics. And therefore you are going to have\nto market in a traditional way and you are going to have to spend more money because that\nis traditionally how marketing happens\u2026 As we grow it will be no different\u201d (DC1)\nIn the mass-market era it has therefore been a priority for existing fair trade ATOs and\ncompanies to start repositioning brands to expand the target market.\nAs such marketing of fair trade has expanded significantly based on market influence and\nchanges in the types of participants (with different beliefs on the relative importance of\nvolume over ideology). We see adopters such as CRG and Branders such as Marks and\nSpencer advertising fair trade produce on television. Even fair trade companies such as\nDay were able to take advantage of television opportunities to expand the marketing.\nSpending on marketing in most fair trade participants increased significantly as fair trade\nattempted to tap a wider market audience with a quality brand message.\nSimultaneously, fair trade has seen an increase in market segmentation within existing\nmarkets. For example, Equal Exchange designed a product category called \u201cIt\u2019s Our\nCoffee\u201d to try and segment the existing market:\n\u201cThe new coffees offer the opportunity to re-enter the market with a little bit more of a\npoliticised message, a little bit more of a vibrant, younger, challenging message. Which\nnobody else is doing, it is looking all rather the same, a little bit stale! The fair trade message\nis ripe to be segmented\u201d (EE1)\n23\nWe are also seeing increases in the level of \u201cgrading\u201d of products from basic to premium\nquality, mirroring the existing ranges available on the shelves. All of this is aimed at\nbuilding a stronger market position and to cannibalise sales of non-fair trade marked\nproducts.\nIn relation to the physical volume of different products, fair trade has exploded from\nbeverages, sugars, fruits, nuts products and confectionary to cover a plethora of products\nwhich continually grows to include rice, flour, footballs, flowers, wine etc. There is no\nend to the number of products ready to become fair trade and the only two restrictions on\ngrowth are set by the FLO; how long it takes to get supply chains accredited and products\nmust come from countries in the \u201cSouth\u201d.\nInstitutionalisation\nThere has been a vast variety of opinions and points of view from interview participants\non where fair trade will move next. It is clear in the first instance that more products will\nbecome available as the queue for accreditation by the FLO gets bigger. There is also\ngoing to be increases in fair trade within the service sector, as many organisation switch\nto fair trade products as part of their bundled packages (e.g. sugar on airplanes or in\nrestaurants). There is also a trend of organisations offering fair trade teas and coffees in\ncorporate headquarters as part of an overall CSR strategy. However the wider\nconsiderations for fair trade in the long-term are more uncertain for participants. The key\nissues they identified are set out below and cover the devaluation of the fair trade mark,\nloss of control by fair trade authorities, fair trade enforcement by companies, branded\n24\ncrafts and eventual institutionalisation (possible industry structure summarised in figure\n4).\nDevaluation of the Fairtrade\u00a9 Mark - A major fear of current participants, especially\nthe authorities, is a growth in alternative trading initiatives offering broadly similar\nobjectives and principles to fair trade. The Rainforest Alliance is a key example of this\nwhere cause-related marketing initiatives are viewed as reasonable alternatives to fair\ntrade (Kenco and the Eden Project have gone with the Rainforest Alliance for their \u201cfair\ntrade\u201d coffee brand). There may therefore become a number of authorities viewed by\nconsumers as in the same market, all offering slight variations on the same issues. Linked\ninto this is a fear about organisations using fair trade as two words (fairtrade\u00a9 as one\nword is copyrighted by the FLO) to sell to consumers without independent auditing.\nSome organisations, such as Forest Fruits (subsidiary of Kestrel Foods), are already\noffering \u201cfair trade\u201d products to compete alongside fairtrade\u00a9 products which may cause\nmore confusion amongst already confused consumers. For instance Mintel (2004) found\nmost consumers still do not know the difference between fair trade and organics.\nLoss of control - Another major fear is that the FLO would \u201cnot be able to control the\nlikes of Nestl\u00e9, if the product didn\u2019t sell they would just drop it and that\u2019s not what fair\ntrade was about\u201d (EE3). By allowing organisations with a questionable historical record\nwith the developing world, many participants felt betrayed by the FLO and FtF and that\nthe floodgates had been opened to anyone able to gain the mark, without ensuring long-\nterm contracts with producers (as currently required under the FLO principles).\n25\nParticipants perceive the increase in branders entering the market as forcing fair trade\ncompanies and adopters back into niche market strategies as the mass-market is denied to\nall but the already brand strong companies. This would therefore accelerate the dilution\nof the ideological purpose of fair trade.\nFair trade enforcement - A further knock on effect of the opening of the flood gates to\nfair trade is perceived as an increase in fair trade enforcement. By this we mean buyers\nforcing fair trade conditions back down the supply chain. Starbucks is a great example\nwhere, rather than change suppliers, Starbucks worked with existing suppliers to develop\nthe appropriate capabilities to meet the demands of fair trade. Up until that point it had\nbeen ATOs such as Twin Trading that had worked with volunteer producer groups to\ndevelop the capabilities. Fair trade may therefore become a more demand, rather than\nsupply, driven initiative.\nBranded crafts - The craft market is also perceived as a new point in fair trade evolution\nas it attempts to catch the commodity market in its market orientation. To date crafts have\nremained a growing market, but have not expanded into high quality, brand oriented\ninitiatives. Over half of respondents identified apparel as a soon to be growth area as fair\ntrade cotton became widely available, companies will exploit the opportunity by\nproducing fashion orientated clothing, as opposed to the limited selection of plain goods\ncurrently available.\n26\nInstitutionalisation - increasing customer demand for fair trade still looks likely,\nespecially in business to business relationships. However, with the predicted devaluation\nof the fair trade mark and increasing concessions made by the FLO to organisations, to\nmaintain the FLO control as the principle body for fair trade accreditation, there is\nperceived by participants a significant likelihood of weakness in eligibility criteria.\nSignificantly in relation to this are moves (such as in the cocoa industry) to undertake\ninitiatives to ensure reductions in child and forced labour throughout industries (this\nbeing one of the fair trade principles). There could therefore be a greater convergence\nbetween fair trade and standard market practice. Similarly organisations are coming\nunder increasing demands to implement CSR policies which again should bring them\ncloser in line with fair trade principles when these are translated into supply chain\ninitiatives. In the consumers mind there will therefore be less to differentiate fair trade\nfrom other market offerings and eventually consumers see too-little difference to make\nfair trade a viable alternative and justify the extra cost. Through this fair trade becomes a\n\u201cone-of-many\u201d offering, promising similar results for the developing world. The bigger\nbrands will therefore survive and companies with successful niche strategies will\nprobably continue. However fair trade could be viewed as being institutionalised in the\nnormal market mechanisms and become of lesser importance to consumers as other\nissues (such as climate control) begin to take more media and organisational focus.\nThis is not to paint fair trade\u2019s future in a negative way, in fact many of the longer term\nfair traders would see institutionalisation as the original intention of fair trade, to create\nchange in the market. Successful brands will still prosper and developing world\n27\nproducers benefit, nevertheless, the impetus behind the initiative must eventually mature\nor fall back into its original niche markets.\nConclusion\nFair trade has adopted an increased commercial orientation in the UK over the past 15-20\nyears. This paper has identified the implications of this for the companies and the\nindustries in which they work. As such it provides three groups of theoretical\ncontributions, one empirical contribution and one practical contribution to the literature.\nThe first group of theoretical contributions is the formulation of the three extant and one\nsuggested future for fair trade. Through this we also provide the empirical contribution to\nthe proposition that their has been a main-streaming \/ mass-marketing of the fair trade\nideology, proposed by Davies and Crane (2003), Renard (2003b) and Moore (2004).\nFurther to this a second group of theoretical contributions come in the form of definitions\nof the key participant in fair trade through these eras to provide long term homogeneity in\nhow fair trade is discussed in academia. Thirdly, theory has been advanced through the\nproduction of supply chain structures indicating the common industry format across\ndifferent periods in fair trade development. As such this paper provides concise\nencapsulation of the development of fair trade of use to both existing and future\nresearchers in the industry. It however also provides a practical illustration of the most\nadvanced market orientated fair trade market of benefit for organisations of different\nnationalities who are just beginning to develop stronger commercial fair trade\npropositions and other interested parties.\n28\nReferences\nBaker, M.
