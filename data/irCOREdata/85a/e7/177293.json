An outstanding question focuses on the extent to which the role of gamma \noscillations in object recognition is dependent on attention. Attentional mechanisms determine the \nallocation of perceptual resources to objects in complex scenes biasing the outcome of their mutual \ncompetitive interactions. Would object-related enhancements in gamma activity also occur for \nunattended objects when perceptual resources are traded off to the processing of concurrent visual \nmaterial? The present electroencephalogram (EEG) study investigated event-related potentials \n(ERPs) and evoked (time and phase-locked) and induced (non time and phase-locked to stimulus \nonset) gamma-band activity (GBA) using a visual discrimination task of low or high perceptual \nload at fixation. The task was performed while task-irrelevant familiar or unfamiliar objects co-\nappeared in the surrounding central area. Attentional focus was kept at fixation by varying \nperceptual load between trials; in such conditions only holistic object processing or low-level \nperceptual processing, requiring little or no attention, are thought to occur. While evoked GBA \nremained unmodulated induced GBA enhancements, specific to familiar object presentations, were \nobserved, thus providing evidence for cortical visual representation of unattended objects. In \naddition, the effect was mostly driven by object-specific activity under low load, implying that in \ncluttered or complex scenes attentional selection likely plays a more significant role in object \nrepresentation.  \n \n \nKeywords: gamma band activity, visual object representation, attention, perceptual load, EEG\n 3 \nIntroduction \n           Various attentional models have attempted to describe mechanisms through which stimuli, \nbased on their task-relevance, are either ignored or selected for further processing (e.g., Treisman, \n1969; Duncan, 1980). Spatial, feature-based and object-based attention are thought to rely \ndifferentially on a set of rapidly functioning neural mechanisms that allow enhancement of \nattended and suppression of unattended information (Reynolds and Chelazzi, 2004). Selective \nattention is essential for efficient processing as sensory information constantly competes for the \nlimited set of available resources (Desimone, 1998). To address this Lavie (1995) proposed a \nmodel of attentional processing that takes into account the amount of perceptual information \n(referred to as \u2017perceptual load\u2018) that the visual system has to take into account in order to perform \naccurate discriminations. Perceptual load is enhanced when the number of items to be processed is \nincreased, or when the task is altered to require discrimination between highly similar features or \nmultiple feature conjunctions. Depending on the amount of load attentional mechanisms distribute \nperceptual resources across the rest of the scene to ensure efficient processing. One such \nmechanism reduces the processing of irrelevant information (referred to as \u2017distractors\u2018) when the \nperceptual load becomes high; another automatically allocates to other elements of a scene, when \nthe perceptual load is low, even if they are task-irrelevant (Lavie, 1995).  \nA selective attention mechanism that controls the allocation of perceptual resources across \nvisual scenes on the basis of stimulus relevance and task demands is very important for visual \nobject representation. Attention is known to play an essential role in guiding the selection and \nprocessing of objects in everyday vision. Relevant objects are given processing priority and placed \nwithin the attentional spotlight (Schroeder, Mehta and Foxe, 2001) - they are foveated, recognised \nand acted upon. However to what level are unattended objects processed? Visual scenes contain \nlarge numbers of objects with varying amounts of clutter and mutual occlusion; these objects are \nconstantly competing for processing resources. Their relevance for the individual\u2018s present \nmotivational state influences the outcome of the competition as relevant objects are given \n 4 \nprocessing priority through attentional selection. But which representation type, if any, is formed \nfor unattended objects? \nIt is generally considered that certain processing streams within the object recognition \nsystem do not require attention thereby allowing for implicit registration of unattended objects up \nto a certain level of representation (for overviews, see Murray and Jones, 2002; Thoma, Hummel \nand Davidoff, 2004). This level is mostly assumed to contain lower level representations of visual \nfeatures within the image and their conjunctions (e.g., colour or shape) and to exclude higher level \nsemantic-based information. Although certain studies found even unattended objects were \nhabitually being processed up to the semantic level (e.g., Pins, Meyer, Foucher, Humphreys and \nBoucart, 2004; Altmann, Grodd, Kourtzi, B\u00fclthoff and Karnath, 2005), other studies which \nexplicitly controlled attention indicated there is very little or no identification without attention \n(Lachter, Forster and Ruthruff, 2004). A recent behavioural study by Thoma et al. (2004) \ndemonstrated that visual representations of ignored objects are holistic in nature while those of \nattended objects are analytic. In the hybrid model of object recognition these two types of visual \nrepresentations occur in parallel and make contact with object memory independently; though only \nanalytic representations contain explicitly delineated relations among an object\u2018s parts. Holistic \nrepresentations do not define these relations explicitly or independently of the parts but instead \nrepresent them within a coordinate system that refers to one particular view of the object (Hummel \nand Stankiewicz, 1996). \nSupport for the hybrid model shows that the level of representation depends on the \nallocation of attention. A behavioural study by Murray and Jones (2002) adopted Lavie\u2018s (1995) \nmodel of perceptual load in order to systematically examine the relation between perceptual \nmechanisms of attentional selection and processing of object representations. A task was used in \nwhich local form information, embedded within a task-irrelevant global familiar object-shape, had \nto be matched in orientation between a reference and a target\/distractor display. This local form \ninformation could either be of low or high perceptual load, which when randomly intermixed \n 5 \nbetween trials avoided strategic biases in attentional deployment. With attention constrained to the \nlocal form information by top-down influences no evidence of semantic processing of surrounding \nobject-shapes was found under low or high load. Lower level pre-semantic processing of \nsurrounding object-shapes still took place however since identical distractors seemed to be \nprocessed more favourably, presumably due to requiring little or no attention.  \nVisuo-spatial attentional selection and the deployment of perceptual resources have also \nbeen examined neuroscientifically. Recent studies have examined the role of peripherally \npresented perceptual load in determining the extent of neural processing of simple visual \ninformation. Handy and Mangun (2000) looked at the role of load using event-related potentials \n(ERPs) and obtained attentional modulations of P1 and N1 components. They suggested this \nreflected early changes in the magnitude of spatial-selective processing in extrastriate visual areas \nwhich increased with higher load. A related blocked design study by Handy, Soltani and Mangun \n(2001) observed a decrease for distractors presented under high foveal load occurring at the level \nof P1, N1 and N2; indicating that perceptual load did effect the early stages of processing of \nsimple task-irrelevant information. In a recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) \nstudy Schwartz, Vuilleumier, Hutton, Maravita, Dolan and Driver (2005) found that purely top-\ndown increases in attentional load at fixation decreased responses to peripheral distractors at the \nlevel of early visual cortex. The effect was larger for higher-level visual areas suggesting \nattentional surround-suppression. High load therefore impacts on neurophysiological markers of \nearly visual processing by reducing responses to simple information in the periphery.  \nHowever the question remains, what markers would be affected by complex visual \ninformation (i.e., objects) presented foveally under different types of perceptual load? Foveally \npresented items have preferential access to attention and therefore interfere more with the \nprocessing of task-relevant information (Beck and Lavie, 2005). The challenges posed by natural \nscenes in everyday life involve mutual occlusion of foveated objects amid varying degrees of \nbackground clutter. How does the brain manage to code each of these objects in a unified way?  It \n 6 \nhas been suggested that neural mechanisms subserving object processing rely on the activity of \ndistributed neural assemblies. This activity is thought to be coordinated by synchronous firing in \nthe gamma-band range (>20 Hz). Such event-related gamma band activity (GBA) can either be \nevoked (time- and phase-locked to stimulus onset) or induced (non time- and phase-locked). \nEvoked GBA is generally focused in the lower gamma-band frequency ranges (30-40 Hz) and has \na stable latency of approximately 100 ms; it is modulated by task complexity (Senkowski and \nHerrmann, 2002; for an opposite finding see Posada, Hugues, Franck, Vianin and Kilner, 2003) \nand feature-selective processing demands (Busch, Schadow, Fruend and Herrmann, 2006b) and \nreflects an early stream of sensory processing.  Induced GBA shows greater variability in \nfrequency (30-90 Hz) and usually peaks at approximately 250 ms with the peak latency related to \nthe time point of object recognition (Martinovic, Gruber and M\u00fcller, 2007). Significant levels of \ninduced GBA are elicited in studies that require identification of foveally presented familiar \nobjects; it is likely that such induced GBA reflects a later stream of representational processing \nconnected to visual memory processes (Gruber, Malinowski and M\u00fcller, 2004; Gruber and M\u00fcller, \n2005). Induced GBA is therefore highly relevant for object recognition studies.  \nThe extent to which integrative oscillatory activity underlying visual object representation \nis attention-dependent has previously been researched using induced gamma band responses as a \nmeasure of perceptual processing. There is some evidence supporting both the role of automatic, \ngestalt-like processes as well as the role of perceptual attentional mechanisms (M\u00fcller, Gruber and \nKeil, 2000; M\u00fcller and Gruber, 2001). Thus it is still an open question if attention is a necessary \nprerequisite for object-related enhancements in induced GBA. What happens with induced GBA \nwhen objects are unattended? Moreover, would GBA amplitude depend on the perceptual load, \nwith highly taxing visual discriminations engaging more perceptual resources away from the task-\nirrelevant objects? Although induced GBA under conditions of different perceptual load has yet to \nbe investigated, if it is a specific marker of integratory processes in object identification its \namplitude should depend on the functioning of perceptual mechanisms of attentional selection.  \n 7 \nThe present electroencephalogram (EEG) study was conducted to provide answers to these \noutstanding questions: (1) do induced GBA enhancements specific for object processing also occur \nfor unattended objects and (2) is their amplitude influenced by differential task demands \nintroduced through changes in the perceptual load. ERPs and evoked and induced GBA were \ninvestigated using a visual matching task of low or high perceptual load at fixation that was \nattended while task-irrelevant familiar or unfamiliar objects co-appeared in the surrounding central \narea. The aim was to examine how much neural processing of surrounding familiar objects \noccurred when attention was directed to complex local form information. A further aim was to \nexamine if this processing differs when perceptual load of task-relevant information was changed \nfrom low to high, thereby influencing the extent of the automatic reallocation of residual resources \nto spatially-coexistent distractors.  \nBased on previous findings on effects of stimulus size on both types of GBA (Busch, \nDebener, Kranczioch, Engel, & Herrmann, 2004) the small local-form stimuli should elicit none or \nvery low event-related GBA (both evoked and induced). This assumption was first tested in \nExperiment 1 by employing only the local-form stimuli of low and high load without the \nsurrounding distractors. This acted as a control for Experiment 2 which tested the hypothesised \neffects of distractors, either familiar or unfamiliar objects, under low and high perceptual load on \nERPs, evoked and induced GBA. Induced GBA is elicited by foveal presentations of familiar but \nnot unfamiliar words and objects (Fiebach, Gruber, & Supp, 2005; Gruber & M\u00fcller, 2005). \nTherefore, differential activations between familiar and unfamiliar objects were expected to be \nsignificant under low load due to the automatic reallocation of leftover resources to salient familiar \nstimuli and their representational processing. For high load it was expected that familiar objects \nwould not be able to trigger significant increases in induced GBA in relation to unfamiliar objects, \nas perceptual capacities would be exhausted by the demanding high load task at fixation (Lavie et \nal, 2004). Evoked GBA, on the other hand, has been modulated by object familiarity in only one \nstudy (Herrmann, Lenz, Junge, Busch and Maess, 2004a). A methodological study by Morup, \n 8 \nHansen, Herrmann, Parnas and Arnfred, (2006), using the same paradigm as Herrmann et al. \n(2004), has shown that the factorial structure of evoked GBA differs between familiar and \nunfamiliar objects; however, these differences were very small, with the two factors explaining \nless than 20% of the variance. Evoked GBA\u2018s object-specificity therefore remains doubtful since \nmost studies do not find an effect of object familiarity (Tallon-Baudry, Bertrand, Delpuech and \nPernier, 1996; Fiebach, Gruber and Supp, 2005; Gruber and M\u00fcller, 2005; Busch, Herrmann, \nM\u00fcller, Lenz and Gruber, 2006a; Gruber, Trujillo-Barreto, Giabbiconi, Valdes-Sosa and M\u00fcller, \n2006). Robust previous findings indicate that evoked GBA is highly responsive to both bottom-up \nand top-down driven feature processing (e.g., Busch et al., 2006b) with the assumption being that \nit is a necessary prerequisite for significant increases in induced GBA (Herrmann, Munk and \nEngel, 2004b). It was therefore hypothesised that evoked GBA would be elicited but that it would \ndissociate from induced GBA, being preferentially modulated by task demands. \nIn order to complement the findings on event-related GBA, ERPs were also examined \nfocusing on the following components: early components P1 and N1, and late components L1 and \nL2. Previous studies have found characteristic modulations of late components by stimulus \nfamiliarity; with unfamiliar stimuli eliciting a more negative L1 and a more positive L2 (Rugg, \nSoardi and Doyle, 1995; Gruber and M\u00fcller, 2005). As previously mentioned, Handy et al. (2001) \nobserved more negativity for distractors under high load; occurring at the level of P1, N1 and N2. \nThese authors speculated however that the P1 effect should be eliminated if load is subjected to \ntrial-by-trial variations, as the attentional focus in these circumstances remains steady across load \nconditions. Since the allocation of attention was supposed to be equal at trial onset, due to \nunpredictability of both load and distractor type, it was expected that the early effects of load on \nP1 and N1 would not be observed. Effects of load could still occur at later processing stages, so it \nwas expected that these differences might be observed on the late components L1 and L2.  \n 9 \nExperiment 1  \nIn the control experiment the central local form stimuli were piloted without any surround \nto verify the presence of behavioural effects of perceptual load and also to determine the optimal \ndisplay times that would ensure desirable pacing for Experiment 2. EEG data was collected in \norder to establish that small foveal stimuli would not by themselves elicit significant \nenhancements in evoked or induced GBA. Since only familiar objects elicit significant increases in \ninduced GBA (Gruber and M\u00fcller, 2005) this allows clear conclusions to be drawn about the \ninteraction between object familiarity and perceptual load, which were to be examined in the main \nexperiment.  \n \nMethods  \nParticipants  \nFourteen participants took part. Two had to be removed due to a technical error during \nEEG recording. Twelve participants (2 male) remained in the sample, aged 19-26 years (mean age \n22.5 years). They were all healthy, right-handed university students and received class credit or a \nsmall honorarium for participation. Participants reported normal or corrected-to-normal vision. \nIndividual written informed consent was obtained and the study conformed to the Code of Ethics \nof the World Medical Association. \n \nMaterials and procedure \nIn the centre of the screen an image was presented that contained three yellow boxes \norganized in a triangular fashion around a red fixation cross (see Figure 1).  \n \n------------------------------------ \ninsert Figure 1 about here \n------------------------------------ \n 10 \nParticipants were instructed to match the content of the upper box with the content of one of the \ntwo boxes below. The index and middle finger of one hand were placed on the two side by side \nbuttons and participants were told to press the button that corresponded to the side of the box with \nthe correct match.  \nBased on Murray and Jones (2002) tasks differing in perceptual load were created. 192 \nstimuli, which included the original Murray and Jones (2002) set, were presented in a randomised \norder, different for each of the participants. In the low perceptual load condition the upper and \nboth of the lower two boxes contained line-forms and the participant had to match the content of \nthe upper box to the lower box that contained exactly the same form. In the high load condition the \nlower boxes contained letters and participants had to match the line-form from the upper box with \nthe letter that fully contained such a line-form within its shape. Participants were instructed to do \nthis as quickly and as accurately as they could.  \nParticipants first performed a practice block of 48 trials (24 per load level) that contained a \nsubset of stimuli that were not used in the experiment itself. The practice was repeated until the \nparticipants reached a criterion of 80% correct \u2013 this usually required one repetition. \nThe experiment itself consisted of four blocks, with each block lasting approximately two \nminutes and containing 48 trials. Each trial consisted of a variable 500-800 ms baseline period \nduring which a red fixation cross (0.2\u00b0 x 0.2\u00b0) was presented. This was followed by a stimulus \npicture that was displayed for 600 ms. The picture was then replaced by the fixation cross which \nremained on the screen for a period of 650 ms. \nStimuli (1\u00b0 x 1\u00b0) were shown on a white background and were presented centrally on a 19-\ninch computer screen, with a 70 Hz refresh rate, that was positioned 1 metre in front of the \nparticipant in a dimly lit soundproof testing chamber. Stimulus onset was synchronised to the \nvertical retrace of the monitor. The presentation and timing of the experiment were controlled \nusing a Matlab Toolbox, allowing precise visual presentation and response-recording timings \n(Cogent, www.vislab.ucl.ac.uk\/Cogent\/; The Mathworks, Inc, Natick, Massachusetts).  \n 11 \n Halfway through the experiment participants were asked to change the responding hand. \nParticipants were instructed to minimise eye movements and blinking during the display of a \nstimulus or the fixation cross. \n \nEEG recording \nEEG was recorded continuously from 128 locations using active Ag-AgCl electrodes \n(BioSemi Active-Two amplifier system) placed in an elastic cap, referenced to an additional active \nelectrode (CMS \u2013 Common Mode Sense; with ground in additional electrode DRL \u2013 Driven Right \nLeg) during recording. EEG signal was sampled at a rate of 512 Hz. Horizontal and vertical \nelectrooculograms were recorded in order to exclude trials with blinks and significant eye \nmovements. EEG was segmented into epochs starting 500 ms prior and lasting 1500 ms following \npicture onset. EEG data processing was performed using the EEGlab toolbox (Delorme and \nMakeig, 2004) combined with self-written procedures running under Matlab (The Mathworks, Inc, \nNatick, Massachusetts). Artifact correction was performed by means of \u2017statistical correction of \nartefacts in dense array studies\u2018 (SCADS; Junghoefer, Elbert, Tucker and Braun, 2000). This \nprocedure is widely accepted in the field and has been applied and described in several \npublications (e.g., Gruber, M\u00fcller, Keil and Elbert, 1999; M\u00fcller and Keil, 2004). The average \nrejection rate was 32.6% resulting in approximately 57 remaining trials per condition on average. \nFurther analyses were performed using the average reference.  \n \nBehavioural data analysis \nReaction times (RTs) between 250 and 1250 ms (the maximum time allowed for responses) \nafter stimulus onset on trials with correct responses were taken into further analysis. Mean RTs \nand error rates were computed for each participant. Differences in error rates and response speed \nbetween low and high perceptual load were analysed using paired t-tests. \n \n 12 \nEvent related potentials analysis \nA 25 Hz low-pass filter was applied to the data before all ERP analyses. \nTwo ERP components were assessed: P1 and N1. For each component regional means \n(shown in Figure 2, see Results) were assigned based on which electrodes exhibited maximal \nactivity when data was collapsed across conditions. Average amplitudes across the electrodes at \nthese sites in their respective time windows (80-120 ms for the P1, 130-190 ms for the N1) were \nthen computed and the mean amplitude during the period 100 ms prior to stimulus onset (baseline) \nwas subtracted. Mean latencies were not analysed as there were no hypotheses concerning them.  \nDifferences in amplitude between low and high perceptual load were analysed using paired t-tests. \n \nAnalysis of evoked and induced spectral changes  \nOscillatory activity was analysed according to the standard procedure employed in a \nmultitude of preceding studies (e.g., Gruber et al., 2004; Gruber and M\u00fcller, 2005). In brief, \nspectral changes in oscillatory activity were analysed by means of Morlet wavelet analysis \n(Bertrand and Pantev, 1994) which provides a good compromise between time and frequency \nresolution (Tallon-Baudry and Bertrand, 1999). This method gives a time-varying magnitude of \nthe signal in each frequency band leading to a time-by-frequency (TF) representation of the signal \nand is described in-depth, together with suggested parameter definitions that allow for a good time \nand frequency resolution in the gamma frequency range, in previous studies (e.g., Gruber and \nM\u00fcller, 2005). In order to achieve good time and frequency resolution in the gamma frequency \nrange the wavelet family was defined by a constant m= f0\/\u03c3f = 7, with f0 ranging from 2.5 to 100 \nHz in 0.5 Hz steps. This data was subsequently reduced to form 2.5 Hz-wide wavelets. Time-\nvarying energy in a given frequency band was calculated for each epoch; this being the absolute \nvalue of the convolution of the signal with the wavelet for each complex spectrum. \nPreliminary electrode sites used for time-by-frequency plots (TF-plots) and further peak \namplitude analyses were selected on the basis of previous findings of maximal local gamma power \n 13 \nelicited by object categorisation paradigms \u2013 parietal for induced GBA (Gruber et al., 2004), and \noccipital for evoked GBA (Tallon-Baudry, Bertrand, Delpuech and Pernier, 1997). These sites \nwere to be readjusted in order to envelop the area of maximal amplitude in case the observed grand \nmean topography happened to differ from previous findings. To depict these topographies wavelet \nanalysis was recalculated for all 128 electrodes. Maps of oscillatory responses in the \u00b15 Hz \nfrequency band centred upon the maximal activity wavelet for each participant during the time \nwindow of maximal activity and were calculated for both conditions by means of spherical spline \ninterpolations (Perrin, Pernier, Bertrand and Echallier, 1988). \nFor both types of GBA the time window of highest gamma amplitude was identified for the \npurposes of the analysis. The length of this time window was defined based on the observed \ngrand-mean GBA; a common approach in previous studies (e.g., Busch, Debener, Kranczioch, \nEngel and Herrmann, 2004; Gruber & M\u00fcller, 2005).  \nIn order to identify the time window and frequency range of the induced GBA peaks, mean \nbaseline-corrected spectral amplitude (baseline: 100 ms prior to stimulus onset) was collapsed for \nall conditions together and represented in TF-plots in the 30-90 Hz range. Regional means of \ninterest were then selected on the basis of grand mean topographies. Due to inter-individual \ndifferences in the induced gamma peak in the frequency domain a specific wavelet for each \nparticipant was chosen, designed for the frequency of his\/her maximal amplitude in the gamma \nrange based upon an average across both low and high load conditions. Centred upon this wavelet \na frequency band of \u00b15 Hz was subsequently formed for statistical analysis.  \nBy definition evoked oscillatory activity is phase-locked to stimulus onset and was \nanalysed through a transformation of the unfiltered ERP into the frequency domain. Evoked GBA \nis a response with low inter-individual variability in latency at frequencies between 30 and 40 Hz, \nwith maximal activity usually occurring in a narrow time interval around 100 ms post stimulus-\nonset. Therefore a \u00b1 5 Hz range was taken around a central wavelet of 35 Hz within a time \nwindow of 50-150 ms.   \n 14 \nIn short, GBA was analysed in the \u00b15 Hz frequency band around the wavelets of interest; \n35 Hz for evoked GBA and individual maximal wavelet for induced GBA. Means and standard \nerrors (SEs) of the mean are reported throughout the results section. Differences against baseline in \nGBA amplitude at the site of the regional mean during the time window of maximal activity were \ntested using independent t-tests against zero.  \n \nResults \nBehavioural data \nMean error rates and their SEs were as follows: low perceptual load 3.1 \u00b1 0.5% and high \nperceptual load 12.3 \u00b1 1.7%. Mean RTs and their SEs, computed only from correctly answered \nitems, were as follows: low load 652 \u00b1 27 ms and high load 848 \u00b1 24 ms. Highly significant \neffects were found with more errors and longer response latencies for higher load (error rate: t (12) \n= -5.76, p < 0.001; RTs: t (12) = -14.56, p < 0.001). \n \nEvent related potentials \nFigure 2 depicts the ERPs. There were no significant effects of perceptual load on either of \nthe components. Both P1 and N1 were maximal at occipital sites. P1 had a grand mean baseline- \n \n------------------------------------ \ninsert Figure 2 about here \n------------------------------------ \n \ncorrected amplitude of 1.95 \u00b1 0.39 \u03bcV for low and 1.99 \u00b1 0.31 \u03bcV for high perceptual load (t (11) \n= -0.20, n.s.). N1 had a grand mean baseline-corrected amplitude of \u20133.47 \u00b1 0.75 \u03bcV for low and \u2013\n3.46 \u00b1 0.72 \u03bcV for high perceptual load (t (11) = -0.03, n.s.). \n \n 15 \nEvoked and induced spectral changes \n \nFigure 3 shows grand mean baseline-corrected TF plots and topographies of event-related \nGBA collapsed across experimental conditions.  \n \n------------------------------------ \ninsert Figure 3 about here \n------------------------------------ \n \nGamma-band amplitude evoked by stimulus presentations between 30 and 40 Hz during a \ntime window of 50-150 ms showed a slight increase at occipital sites (Figure 3a) throughout the \nlower gamma-frequency ranges. This increase was not significant for either low load (0.05 \u00b1 0.04 \n\u03bcV, t (11) = 1.22, n.s), or high load (0.004 \u00b1 0.03 \u03bcV, t (11) = 0.16, n.s).  \nSpectral amplitude induced by stimulus presentations showed a slight enhancement in a \ntime window from approximately 170 to 410 ms after stimulus onset in a frequency range between \n30 and 80 Hz (Figure 3b). This enhancement was also not significant when tested against zero for \neither low load (0.01 \u00b1 0.03 \u03bcV, t (11) = 0.25, n.s) or high load (0.04 \u00b1 0.03 \u03bcV, t (11) = 1.32, \nn.s.). \n \nConclusion \nBehavioural effects of perceptual load were obtained both in error rates and RTs. Early \nERP components P1 and N1 were not significantly modulated by perceptual load. This confirms \nour hypothesis and is in accordance with Handy et al\u2018s (2001) predictions that under constant \nattentional allocation the early effects of load should be eliminated. It was also determined that \nlow and high load local-form stimuli did not produce significant enhancements in either evoked or \ninduced GBA. This leads to the conclusion that the matching tasks of either low or high load do \n 16 \nnot have the capacity to elicit significant event-related GBA, such as the one usually observed in \nobject recognition tasks, when presented in isolation.  \n \nExperiment 2 \n \nIn Experiment 2 the local form stimuli of low and high perceptual load were co-presented \nwith either familiar or unfamiliar task-irrelevant objects. Behavioural effects of load in the absence \nof effects of distractor type were expected since this has been observed in previous studies where \nload varied from trial to trial (e.g., Murray & Jones, 2002). To repeat the crucial hypotheses; \ninduced GBA elicited by presentations of familiar as opposed to unfamiliar objects was expected \nto show enhancements, driven by increases in activity under low load. Additionally it was \nexpected that evoked GBA would dissociate from induced GBA by showing enhancements with \nincreases in perceptual load irrespective of distractor type.  \n \nMethods \nParticipants \nNineteen participants took part. Three had to be removed from the sample due to excessive \nEEG artifacts. The remaining sixteen (4 male), aged 19-46 years (mean age 24.5 years) were all \nhealthy, right-handed university students and received class credit or a small honorarium for \nparticipation. Participants reported normal or corrected-to-normal vision. Individual written \ninformed consent was obtained and the study conformed to the Code of Ethics of the World \nMedical Association. \nMaterials and procedure \nThe central stimuli from Experiment 1 were superimposed over a background that could \ncontain either a familiar object or an unfamiliar object. The unfamiliar objects were created from \n 17 \nfamiliar objects by image distortion (see Figure 4 for examples). Intersecting the factors of load \nand familiarity four conditions were formed: low load familiar, low load unfamiliar, high load \n \n------------------------------------ \ninsert Figure 4 about here \n------------------------------------ \n \nfamiliar and high load unfamiliar. 96 stimuli were shown for each of the four conditions. As the \nobject set contained 384 images, each of the 192 local form stimuli were shown twice during the \nexperiment and were assigned to two pairs of images, familiar and unfamiliar.   \nThe objects in the images were 1.4\u00b0 to 4.5\u00b0 of visual angle in size. The presentation was \nrandomised and counterbalanced to ensure that if one participant saw one half of the images in \nfamiliar and the other half in unfamiliar form a second matched participant would see them \npresented in opposite conditions, i.e., if one saw the \u2017cat\u2018 the other would see the distorted version \nof the \u2017cat\u2018.  \nThe experiment consisted of four blocks lasting approximately five minutes and containing \n96 trials each. Each trial consisted of a variable 500-800 ms baseline period during which a red \nfixation cross (0.2\u00b0 x 0.2\u00b0) was presented. This was followed by a stimulus picture that was \ndisplayed for 650 ms. The picture was then replaced by the fixation cross which remained on the \nscreen for a period of 750 ms (see Figure 5 for trial outlook).  \n \n \n \n------------------------------------ \ninsert Figure 5 about here \n------------------------------------ \n 18 \n \nThe experiment used the same tools and equipment as Experiment 1. Stimulus presentation \nsetup and response collection were also the same. Participants were instructed to perform the task \nas in Experiment 1 and were told to ignore the irrelevant background images.  \n \nEEG recording \nFor general information on EEG recording procedure see methods section for Experiment \n1. The average rejection rate in this experiment was 25.9% resulting in an average of \napproximately 64 remaining trials per condition.  \n \nBehavioural data analysis \nReaction times between 250 and 1400 ms (the maximum time allowed for responses) after \nstimulus onset on trials with correct responses were taken into further analysis. Mean RTs and \nerror rates were computed for each participant. Differences in error rates and response speed \nbetween conditions were analysed with a 2 x 2 repeated measures ANOVA with the within-subject \nfactors of perceptual load (low and high) and distractor type (familiar or unfamiliar object). \n \n Event-related potentials analysis \nAs in Experiment 1 a 25 Hz low-pass filter was applied to the data before all ERP analyses. \nTwo early (P1, N1) and two late (L1, L2) ERP components were assessed. For each component \nregional means (shown in Figure 6, see Results) were assigned to areas encompassing maximal \nactivity electrodes when data was collapsed across conditions.  Average amplitudes across \nelectrodes at these sites in the respective time window (see Table 1, Results section) were then \ncomputed and the mean amplitude during the period 100 ms prior to stimulus onset (baseline) was \nsubtracted. Mean latencies were not analysed since no differences were predicted. Each \ncomponent was subject to a 2 x 2 repeated measures ANOVA comprising the within-subjects \n 19 \nfactors of perceptual load (low and high) and distractor type (familiar and unfamiliar objects). \nMeans and standard error rates are reported throughout the results section. Post-hoc tests were \nperformed using paired t-tests. \n \n  Analysis of Evoked and Induced Spectral Changes  \nOscillatory activity was analysed according to the same general procedure described in the \nmethods section of Experiment 1. The time windows and regional means were selected on the \nbasis of grand mean TF plots and topographies and GBA was analysed in the \u00b1 5 Hz frequency \nband around the wavelets of interest; 35 Hz for evoked GBA and individual maximal wavelet for \ninduced GBA. The evoked GBA did not exhibit a specific peak and therefore a 30-40 Hz range \nwas chosen in order to make the findings comparable to previous studies (Herrmann et al., 2004a; \nGruber and M\u00fcller, 2005).  \nIn order to obtain differential activity in the gamma-band that reflected object-specific \nprocessing, activity elicited by unfamiliar objects was subtracted from the activity elicited by \nfamiliar objects within every load level; i.e., low load familiar minus low load unfamiliar; high \nload familiar minus high load unfamiliar. The same procedure was employed to obtain differential \nactivity in the gamma-band related to task demands only, with activity elicited by low load \nsubtracted from activity elicited by high load tasks within every object familiarity level (i.e., high \nload unfamiliar minus low load unfamiliar; high load familiar minus low load familiar). The sites \nwith maximal amplitude changes between conditions were identified from the topographies of \ndifferential activity obtained by the subtractions. GBA amplitude was tested at these sites with a \n2x2 repeated measures ANOVA with the within-subject factors of perceptual load (low and high) \nand distractor type (familiar or unfamiliar object). Tests were performed on the activity in the \u00b1 5 \nHz frequency band around each participant\u2018s maximal wavelet for induced GBA and on the \nactivity in the 30-40 Hz range for evoked GBA. Subtractions of GBA elicited by different \nconditions have already been used in studies that employed stimuli which were highly comparable \n 20 \nbetween conditions (e.g., the coloured checker boards used in the attentional study by M\u00fcller and \nKeil, 2004). Such subtractions make it possible to isolate the activity related to a specific function. \nIt was expected that the overall amplitudes in Experiment 2 would be rather small, as the small \nvisual material for the matching task (Experiment 1) and unfamiliar objects (Gruber and M\u00fcller, \n2005) elicit very little event-related GBA on their own. By topographically localising the \ndifferences between closely matched conditions, load or familiarity, one is able to maximise the \nsignal by focusing on the aspects that are most likely to reflect the representational processes of \ninterest. Means and standard errors are reported throughout.  \n \nResults \nBehavioural data \nMean error rates with SEs were as follows: low load unfamiliar object, 2.2 \u00b1 0.5%; low \nload familiar object, 1.9 \u00b1 0.3%; high load unfamiliar object, 11.8 \u00b1 1.4%; and high load familiar \nobject, 13.6 \u00b1 1.7%. Mean RTs with SEs were: low load unfamiliar object, 699 \u00b1 14 ms; low load \nfamiliar object, 705 \u00b1 15 ms; high load unfamiliar object, 916 \u00b1 14 ms; and high load familiar \nobject, 925 \u00b1 17 ms. There were no interactions between the two factors of perceptual load and \ndistractor type (error rates: F (1,15) = 1.56, n.s.; RTs: F (1,15) = 0.13, n.s.). There was a main \neffect of perceptual load with a very significant increase in errors (F (1,15) = 82.6, p < 0.001) and \nslowing of responses for high as opposed to low load (F (1,15) = 912.38, p < 0.001). The factor of \ndistractor type had no effect on error rates (F (1,15) = 0.86, n.s.) or speed of responding (F (1.15) = \n2.7, p = 0.12). \nEvent Related Potentials \nFigure 6 depicts the ERP components and Table 1 provides information on their properties. \nA 2 x 2 repeated measures ANOVA was used to compare across conditions (perceptual load; \ndistractor type). \n \n 21 \n------------------------------------ \ninsert Figure 6 about here \n------------------------------------ \n \n------------------------------------ \ninsert Table 1 about here \n------------------------------------ \n \nP1 was maximal at occipital sites and showed no interaction between the two factors (F \n(1,15) = 1.58, n.s.) and no main effect of load (F (1,15) = 0.78, n.s.). There was an effect of \ndistractor type (F (1,15) = 5.34, p < 0.05) being enhanced under high load for unfamiliar items in \ncomparison to familiar items (t (15) = 2.27; p < 0.05). There were no modulations of the N1 \ncomponent (load: F (1,15) = 0.21, n.s.; distractor type: F (1,15) = 0.08, n.s.; interaction of the two \nfactors: F (1,15) = 1.41, n.s.). L1 was modulated both by load (F (1,15) = 31.45, p < 0.001), being \nenhanced for unfamiliar items, and by distractor type (F (1,15) = 8.19; p < 0.05), being enhanced \nfor high load stimuli. There was no interaction between the two factors (F (1,15) = 1.50, n.s.). L2 \nwas enhanced under high load (F (1,15) = 8.52, p < 0.05) with a modulation by distractor type (F \n(1,15) = 4.06, p = 0.06) that approached statistical significance. There was a trend for \nenhancements for familiar objects under low load (t (15) = -1.97, p = 0.07).  \n \nEvoked and induced spectral changes \nFigure 7a shows grand mean baseline-corrected TF plots for evoked GBA. Figure 7b shows \nthe topography for data collapsed across experimental conditions. Figure 7c shows grand mean \namplitudes at the regional mean for each condition. Figure 7d shows topographies of the grand \nmeans of subtractions between levels of evoked GBA denoting object specificity within every load \ntype, familiar minus unfamiliar, or task-specificity within every distractor type, high load versus \n 22 \nlow load. Figure 7e shows grand mean amplitudes for each condition at the sites of maximal \ndifferences represented in Figure 7d.  \n \n------------------------------------ \ninsert Figure 7 about here \n------------------------------------ \n \nGamma-band amplitude evoked by picture presentations during a time window of 50-150 \nms showed an increase at occipital sites in the 30 to 40 Hz gamma-frequency range (Figure 7a and \n7c). This activity extended into the lower frequencies, up to 20 Hz, in accordance with findings on \nevoked GBA in visual information processing tasks (Keil, Stolarova, Heim, Gruber and M\u00fcller, \n2003). When tested against zero, as shown in Figure 7b, above-baseline activity was found for low \nload familiar (t (15) = 2.43, p < 0.05) and for both high load conditions (unfamiliar: t (15) = 3.14, \np < 0.01; familiar: t (15) = 2.83, p < 0.05). Significant evoked GBA increases against baseline \nwere not observed for low load unfamiliar objects (t (15) = 1.5, n.s.).  \nSubtractions within load type and distractor type revealed that maximal differences in \nactivity were situated at central occipital sites (Figure 7d). A 2x2 repeated measures ANOVA \nshowed that activity at these sites in the 30-40 Hz range (Figure 7e) remained unmodulated by \nobject familiarity (F (1,15) = 0.05, n.s.) or perceptual load (F (1,15) = 1.57, n.s.).  \nFigure 8a shows grand mean baseline-corrected TF plots for induced GBA. Figure 8c \nshows the topography for grand mean data collapsed across experimental conditions. Figure 8b \nshows grand mean amplitudes at the regional mean (defined as electrode sites with maximal \nactivity, see Figure 8c) for each condition separately. Figure 8d shows topographies of grand mean \nsubtractions between levels of induced GBA denoting object specificity within every load type, \nfamiliar minus unfamiliar, or task-specificity within every distractor type, high load minus low \n 23 \nload. Figure 8e shows grand mean amplitudes for each condition at the sites of maximal \ndifferences represented in Figure 8d. \n \n------------------------------------ \ninsert Figure 8 about here \n------------------------------------ \n \nSpectral amplitude induced by picture presentations showed an enhancement in a time \nwindow from approximately 170 to 450 ms after stimulus onset in a frequency range between 40 \nand 90 Hz (Figure 8a). This enhancement was highly significant when tested against zero for the \nlow load familiar object condition (t (15) = 4.83, p < 0.001) although it was not significant for the \nlow load unfamiliar object condition (t (15) = 1.44, n.s.). Both high load conditions elicited \ninduced GBA which was significantly increased compared to baseline (unfamiliar object: t (15) = \n2.72, p < 0.05; familiar object: t (15) = 3.38, p < 0.005).  \nDifferential task-specific activity was computed by subtracting induced GBA elicited by \nlow load tasks from the induced GBA elicited by high load tasks for each participant and then \ncalculating a grand mean across participants to obtain task-related activity within every distractor \ntype. The same type of subtractions (familiar minus unfamiliar object) was performed within every \nperceptual load level to obtain object-specific activity in the induced GBA. Figure 8d shows that \nthe highest differences were centred on left parieto-occipital sites. When the activity at these sites \n(Figure 8e) was tested with a 2x2 repeated measures ANOVA a highly significant main effect of \nobject familiarity was found (F (1,15) = 8.75, p < 0.01). This effect was mostly driven by increases \nin induced GBA under low load (t (15) = -2.25, p < 0.05) while the object-specific change under \nhigh load was not significant (t (15) = -0.56, n.s.). There was no main effect of task demands (F \n(1,15) = 0.02, n.s.).  \n 24 \nFrom comparisons between Figures 7b and 8b and the t-tests against zero it is clear that \ninduced GBA was most significantly enhanced for familiar objects under low load. Evoked GBA \namplitude was most significantly enhanced for high load items. While induced GBA amplitude \nwas significantly enhanced by object familiarity at left parieto-occipital sites (Figure 8e), occipital \nevoked GBA remained unmodulated (Figure 7e). Post-hoc tests have shown that object-specific \nincreases in induced GBA were most evident under low perceptual load. \n \nDiscussion \n \nIn line with previous studies (Lavie, 1995; Murray and Jones, 2002; Lavie, Hirst, de \nFockert and Viding, 2004) the obtained behavioural results exhibited main effects of load but not \nof distractor type suggesting that the attentional focus was consistently assigned to the central \nstimuli in both low and high load conditions. In line with these findings the early components P1 \nand N1 were not modulated by load thus confirming Handy et al\u2018s (2001) predictions. Therefore, \nwe conclude that throughout the experiment attention was equally allocated to the central stimuli \nirrespective of perceptual load. \nThe role of event-related GBA as a neural marker of representational processing of \nunattended objects can therefore be appraised. According to our hypotheses, some representational \nprocessing of unattended objects should occur under conditions of low perceptual load and \ninduced GBA should be a marker of this object-specific activity. In fact none of the studied ERP \ncomponents (P1, N1, L1 and L2) showed any specific modulations by object familiarity under low \nload. Significant levels of evoked GBA always preceded enhancements in induced GBA, as \npredicted by Herrmann et al. (2004b). However, evoked GBA failed to show any significant \nmodulations. The only component that showed specific sensitivity to object familiarity was the \ninduced GBA. This object-specific activity was centred at left parieto-occipital sites; this was \nespecially pronounced when perceptual load was low.  \n 25 \nA series of studies had previously failed to find any differential processing of familiar \nagainst unfamiliar objects in the evoked GBA (Tallon-Baudry et al., 1996; Fiebach et al., 2005; \nGruber and M\u00fcller, 2005; Gruber et al., 2006). Herrmann et al. (2004) has thus far been the only \nstudy that found a significant increase in evoked GBA for familiar objects. Just as in Herrmann et \nal. (2004), object identity in this study was task irrelevant and its processing was therefore \nincidental. Such incidental processing can be bottom-up driven, relying on image-features that are \nunique to salient object configurations; e.g., the geometrical stability and the qualities of \nelongation and symmetry axes specific to objects (see Marr, 1982). Evoked GBA is an early \nmarker sensitive to both bottom-up and top-down influences (Busch et al., 2006b) and is extremely \nresponsive to object properties; even more so than early ERPs (Busch et al., 2004). On the basis of \nmany studies on shape familiarity and figure-ground factors (Peterson and Gibson, 1993; Peterson \nand Gibson, 1994a; Peterson and Gibson, 1994b; for an overview see Peterson and Skow-Grant, \n2003) it was concluded that object memories constitute a configural cue that contributes to early \nperceptual organisation, it is therefore very difficult to argue in favour of a particular mnemonic \nrole for evoked GBA separate from its function as a marker of feature-based processing that is \nsensory in origin (Karakas and Basar, 1998). Further research should focus on the importance of \ntask-relevance of object identity since this is likely to play a crucial role in determining whether \nevoked GBA shows a more bottom-up effect of configural processing when identity is task-\nirrelevant (Herrmann et al., 2004) or a more top-down effect of task-relevant processing of \nimage\u2018s features for the purpose of identification (Tallon-Baudry et al., 1996; Fiebach et al., 2005; \nGruber and M\u00fcller, 2005; Gruber et al., 2006). \nThis study did not support the hypothesis that evoked GBA would be a sensitive marker for \nincreases in task demands. This negative finding is similar to Posada et al.\u2018s (2003) study which \nfound no effects of task complexity on evoked GBA by contrasting a simple colour-to-button \nvisual association task with a more complex rule-based task. It runs contrary to Senkowski & \nHerrmann\u2018s (2002) finding that increased task complexity augments evoked GBA. Senkowski & \n 26 \nHerrmann (2002) contrasted a complex task to a passive viewing task, which suggests that changes \nin demand need to be sufficiently large in order to modulate evoked GBA amplitude. Posada et al. \n(2003) found an effect of task complexity on induced gamma-band oscillations at right parietal \nsites and explained it by additional attentional top-down influences introduced by the need to \nperform a rule-operation in the complex task. In the current study, due to randomly intermixed \ntrials of low and high load, attention remained constrained to the local-form stimuli by top-down \ninfluences. This explains why induced GBA remained unmodulated by changes in task demands \nbetween the low and high load.  \nIt is also necessary to contrast Experiment 1, which found no significant GBA for low or \nhigh load tasks in isolation, with Experiment 2, which found both evoked and induced GBA were \nsignificantly enhanced against baseline when high load distractors were paired with unfamiliar \nobjects. This implies that a simple increase in the complexity of the stimulus results in above-\nbaseline increases in activity. These enhancements are likely to be an outcome of more intense \nsuppression of the surrounding spatially-coexistent distractors while performing a perceptually \ndemanding high load task.  This explanation is in accordance with the biased competition model of \nattention which applies in particular to the processing within the ventral visual stream responsible \nfor object recognition (e.g., see Desimone, 1998). It suggests that the competition arising from \nmore complex stimulus configurations could in itself result in enhanced levels of event-related \nGBA. This is not surprising since synchronisation of responses in the visual cortex at the \nfrequencies of 20-65 Hz has been shown to result from intercortical coupling mechanisms whose \neffectivity rises as central activation increases (Herculano-Houzel, Munk et al. 1999). \nFurthermore, neurons which receive the inhibitory postsynaptic potentials of GABAergic \ninterneurons form the root of these high frequency components in network-driven synaptic activity \nsince their potentials carry more synchronicity and power in the gamma-band range (Hasenstaub, \nShu et al. 2005). Interneuronal involvement has also been explicitly acknowledged by the \nrepresentational hypothesis of Tallon-Baudry and Bertrand (1999). Similarly, a modulation of the \n 27 \nP1 by distractor type was also found in this study, with specific enhancements for unfamiliar \nobjects under high load. This leads to the supposition that an interplay between concurrent early \nenhancement of central task-relevant information and suppression of co-localised distractors might \nreflect on the P1 effect (Luck, 1995).   \nReturning to the crucial finding that induced GBA is the only object-specific marker of \nrepresentational neural processing, ERP components L1 and L2, that relate to the processing of \nobjects, did not show such specificity. The late ERP component L1 was modulated by object \nfamiliarity and load, being monotonously enhanced both for high load and for unfamiliar objects. \nL1 enhancements for unfamiliar objects are in line with previous findings (Gruber and M\u00fcller, \n2005). The late component L2 showed a trend to increase under high load for familiar objects. \nThis supports Gruber and M\u00fcller (2005) who also found a trend towards L2 enhancements for \nrepetitions of familiar objects showing that this late component, related to semantic processing, is \nresponsive to familiar object identities. These robust ERP findings are in accordance with existing \nliterature but this study\u2018s main contribution lies in its ability to demonstrate that induced GBA is \nthe most relevant marker of representational processing of unattended objects . This further \nstrengthens Tallon-Baudry and Bertrand\u2018s (1999) representational hypothesis which claims that \ninduced GBA is a neural marker of cortical object representation.  \nIncreases in induced GBA for familiar objects were driven by enhancements in activity \nunder low load in accordance with Lavie\u2018s (1995) model. This model claims that high load \neffectively reduces distractor perception and predicts that under high load no priming should be \npossible. Since induced GBA is a priming-sensitive component (Gruber and M\u00fcller, 2002; Gruber \net al., 2004; Fiebach et al., 2005; Gruber and M\u00fcller, 2005) the lack of object-specific effects \nunder high load could also have been predicted thus further supporting the representational \nhypothesis.  \nFinally the lack of object-specific effects under high load has important implications for the \nrole of attentional selection in visual representation of objects. High load conditions with foveally \nField Code Changed\n 28 \nco-localised items can be perceived as a simplified model of object processing in complex visual \nscenes. From our findings it is clear that selective attention does have a crucial role to play in the \nprocessing of objects under high perceptual demands. Such high demands loosely approximate \neveryday situations in which the visual system is faced with multitudes of ambiguous, cluttered \nvisual scenes. Objects under low load conditions seem to hold a privileged status in the processing \nhierarchy and can capture perceptual resources, which is reflected in specific increases of induced \nGBA. Under high load conditions however processing is determined by perceptual mechanisms of \nattentional selection. In situations that involve competition between different stimuli these \nmechanisms ensure the most efficient processing of attended content with a general suppression of \nsurrounding information. Taken together this evidence further supports the idea that high \nfrequency oscillatory synchrony, and in particular its induced component, is likely to be a \nfundamental mechanism both for automatic coherent percept formation and for perceptual \ninformation processing and attentional selection, also evidenced in a recent \nmagentoencephalographic study on induced GBA (Vidal, Chaumon, O\u2018Regan and Tallon-Baudry, \n2006). As object coding is heavily reliant on perceptual, mnemonic and attentional processes this \nexplains why visual representation of objects is specifically marked by enhancements in induced \nhigh-frequency oscillatory synchrony. \n \n \n \nAcknowledgments: We would like to thank Renate Zahn and Tobias Forderer for help with data \nacquisition, Sophie Trauer for help with stimulus design and data acquisition, S\u00f8ren Andersen for \ntechnical assistance and Anthony Martyr for proofreading the manuscript.
