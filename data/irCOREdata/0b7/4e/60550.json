The widespread nature of these abnor-\nmalities has led to substantial interest from \nscientists and the general public. This concern \nstems, in part, from the hypothesis that repro-\nductive diseases seen in humans are also caused \nby exposure to the same chemical contami-\nnants (Skakkebaek et al. 2001). However, the \nactual evidence to support the wildlife\u2013human \nconnection is weak. Moreover, in most cases \nthere is little evidence to link cause and effect \nin even a single species, let alone multiple spe-\ncies. Some of the best evidence has been found \nin riverine fish populations where feminization \nof wild male fish (e.g., Jobling et al. 1998) is \nthought to be caused predominantly by expo-\nsure to steroidal estrogens in wastewater treat-\nment work (WWTW) effluents originating \nfrom human and animal excretion (Desbrow \net al. 1998; Routledge et al. 1998), with minor \ncontributions from other estrogenic chemi-\ncals found in WWTWs effluents, such as bis-\nphenols and phthalates, nonylphenols (NPs) \nand their ethoxylates, and carboxylates (Gibson \net al. 2005; Harries et al. 1997; Vajda et al. \n2008; Vethaak et al. 2005). \nSupporting the role of these steroidal \nestrogens in the feminization of wild fish, \nrecently, a very strong correlation was shown \nbetween the predicted steroidal estrogen con-\ntent of U.K. rivers and feminization in wild \nfish (Jobling et al. 2006). Reproductive dis-\norders also seen in human males are, however, \nbest induced by exposing laboratory rodents \nto environmentally relevant concentrations \nof antiandrogens and estrogens rather than \nto estrogens alone (Sharpe and Skakkebaek \n2008; Skakkebaek et al. 2001), thus suggest-\ning that the etiology of endocrine-disruptor\u2013\ninduced reproductive diseases likely differ in \nhumans and fish. Notwithstanding this, the \nfact that there are > 100,000 substances in \nwastewater effluents (not including the differ-\nent isomers of chemicals or their products of \ndegradation), many of which have endocrine-\ndisrupting properties other than estrogenic, \nmakes it highly likely that the femi nizing \nresponses seen in male fish also have a multi-\ncausal etiology involving chemicals with \nnon estrogenic mecha nisms of action. The \nobjective of the present study, therefore, was \nto further explore this possibility by challeng-\ning the hypothesis that steroidal estrogens \nare solely responsible for widespread sexual \ndisruption seen in wild fish in U.K. rivers. \nWe used data on hormonal (estrogenic, anti-\nestrogenic, androgenic, and anti androgenic) \nactivities and concentrations of known \nendocrine disruptors in WWTW effluents, \ntogether with hydrologic data, to predict \nhormone and anti hormone concentrations \nin receiving waters over a wide geographic \nrange. We then explored their relationships \nwith sexual disruption in the wild fish living \nin these waters using statistical modeling. The \nresults suggest that antiandrogenic chemi-\ncals of unknown identities are widespread in \nU.K. effluents and receiving waters and that, \nin addition to the steroidal estrogens, these \nconstituents of WWTW effluents are likely to \nplay a major role in causing endocrine disrup-\ntion in wild fish.\nMethods\nData sources.

This \nconcern stems from the view that the effects observed have a parallel in humans, and that both \nphenomena are caused by exposure to mixtures of contaminants that interfere with reproductive \ndevelopment. The evidence for a \u201cwildlife\u2013human connection\u201d is, however, weak: Testicular dys-\ngenesis syndrome, seen in human males, is most easily reproduced in rodent models by exposure to \nmixtures of antiandrogenic chemicals. In contrast, the accepted explanation for feminization of wild \nmale fish is that it results mainly from exposure to steroidal estrogens originating primarily from \nhuman excretion.\noBjectives: We sought to further explore the hypothesis that endocrine disruption in fish is multi-\ncausal, resulting from exposure to mixtures of chemicals with both estrogenic and antiandrogenic \nproperties.\nMethods: We used hierarchical generalized linear and generalized additive statistical modeling \nto explore the associations between modeled concentrations and activities of estrogenic and anti-\nandrogenic chemicals in 30 U.K. rivers and feminized responses seen in wild fish living in these rivers.\nresults: In addition to the estrogenic substances, antiandrogenic activity was prevalent in almost \nall treated sewage effluents tested. Further, the results of the modeling demonstrated that feminizing \neffects in wild fish could be best modeled as a function of their predicted exposure to both antian-\ndrogens and estrogens or to antiandrogens alone.\nconclusion: The results provide a strong argument for a multicausal etiology of widespread femi-\nnization of wild fish in U.K. rivers involving contributions from both steroidal estrogens and xeno-\nestrogens and from other (as yet unknown) contaminants with antiandrogenic properties. These \nresults may add further credence to the hypothesis that endocrine-disrupting effects seen in wild fish \nand in humans are caused by similar combinations of endocrine-disrupting chemical cocktails.\nkey words: antiandrogen, endocrine disruption, estrogen, feminization, fish, testicular dysgenesis. \nEnviron Health Perspect 117:797\u2013802 (2009). doi:10.1289\/ehp.0800197 available via http:\/\/dx.doi.\norg\/  [Online 7 January 2009]\nJobling et al.\n798 volume 117 | number 5 | May 2009 \u2022 Environmental Health Perspectives\neffluent chemistry from the results of a U.K. \nnational survey of sewage treatment works \neffluents (locations shown in Figure 1).

The detailed \nmethods for the chemical analysis have been \nfully described by the Environment Agency \n(2007) and in other articles in which these \ndata have also been examined (Johnson et al. \n2007; Thorpe et al. 2006).

In the present \nstudy, we identified 30 sites where modeled \npredictions of exposure to steroidal estrogens, \nNPs, and hormonal activities in the receiving \nenvironment could be made and where fish \nwere also captured. The sites covered a wide \ngeographical range and had a wide variation \nin the proportion of the flow of the river com-\nposed of sewage effluent.\nFor each site, we divided the concentrations \nof various estrogenic chemicals and hormonal \nactivities in the effluents of WWTWs located \nupstream by the dilution factor in the river at \nthe point of fish capture to obtain estimated \nconcentrations of each parameter in the river. \nMethods and supporting references have been \npublished previously (Jobling et al. 2006).\nMeasurements of sexual disruption in \nfish.

These were fitted in a step-wise man-\nner, first accounting for the effects due to estro-\ngens and then allowing for additional effects \nthat could be explained by anti androgens and \nNP. We used logistic regression to analyze the \nbinary response variables oocytes, fem.duct, \nand VTG. Generalized linear models (GLM) \nwith gamma-distributed errors (McCullagh \nand Nelder 1989) fit the response fem.index \nwell. For all responses, the data had a hierarchi-\ncal structure with varying numbers (12\u201371) \nof fish sampled from the 30 sites. The con-\ncentrations of each pollutant were at site level, \nand the response variables were at fish level. \nA consequence of the data structure was that \ncorrelations between fish within sites could \nbe anticipated and needed to be accounted \nfor in the analysis. This was accomplished by \nfirst fitting hierarchical GLMs (Gelman and \nHill 2007) with random effects for sites. For \nsome responses, variation between sites was \nnot significant; subsequent analyses were then \nsimplified to ordinary non hierarchical GLMs. \nAn example of the general form of hierarchical \nmodel for a binary response is \nlogit (\u03b8ik) = \u03b20 + \u03b21k ageik + \u03b22xk + \u03b5ik,\nwhere \u03b8ik is the probability of response for \nfish i in site k, and xk is the concentration of \none of the pollutants at site k. This example is \nrepresented graphically in Figure 2, in which \neach rectangle is a level of variation.\nOnce important covariates were estab-\nlished using these models, we obtained \nsmoothed estimates of the relationships using \ngeneralized additive models (GAMs) (Wood \n2006). Our aim was to describe the way that \ncovariates interacted with each other in their \neffect on a response. Surface plots of the fitted \nmodels indicate whether pollutants combined \nin an additive, synergistic, or antagonistic \nway in their joint effect on the response. Two \ncovariates either a) act additively, in the sense \nthat they affect the response independently of \neach other and the joint effect is the sum of \ntheir separate effects; or b) interact with each \nother in their effect on the response. In the \nlatter case, the interaction can be either syner-\ngistic or antagonistic.\nWe performed the statistical computa-\ntions using R software (R Development Core \nTeam 2007).\nResults\nExposure predictions.

For some final effluents, we could \nnot identify quantifiable peaks for either the \nsteroids in the effluent extracts or the internal \nstandards in the spiked samples, particularly \nEE2 (present at the lowest concentrations). \nThese samples were noted as no quantifiable \npeak (NQP). For samples where the analyte \nwas present at a concentration below detection, \nwe assigned a value of one-half the detection \nlimit to the effluent. After adjustment to allow \nfor dilution in the river, these values were near \nzero. NP and NPnEO were also predicted to \nbe present in river water, with concentrations \nof NP ranging from 0.003 to 2.079 \u00b5g\/L. At \nonly 5 of the sites, the concentration of NP was \npredicted to exceed 1 \u00b5g\/L in river water.\nStatistical analysis of the distribution of \nthe chemicals. A statistical investigation of \nthe distributions of the various pollutants \nand hormonal activities present at the sites \nsampled revealed that many of them were \nco-occurrent (Table 2). A consequence of the \nmulti colinearity seen in the measurements \nof the various contaminants was that if the \nrelative proportions of estrogens and anti-\nandrogens were similar across the sites, it \nwould have been difficult to distinguish their \nseparate effects on fish. Fortunately, however, \nthe results of the PCA (Figure 3) revealed that \nthe variation in the chemical composition of \nthe sample sites could be separated into three \nmain components or gradients, including one \ncomponent (component 2; explaining 24% \nof the variation in the data) that differenti-\nated the sites with high relative proportions \nof estrogens from those where anti androgens \npredominated. Together, the three compo-\nnents accounted for 87.5% of the variation \nin the data: Component 1 (50.3%) separated \ncontaminated waters from background, and \ncomponent 3 (12.4%) was mainly indicative \nof the concentration of EE2 compared with \nthe other steroidal estrogens\nStatistical associations between the chemi-\ncal exposure and the biological response \nvariables. The results of the PCA analysis \nindicated that it may be possible to separate \nthe modeling of the associations between \nthe feminizing effects seen in the fish and \nthe anti androgen exposure from those asso-\nciated with estrogens. The hypothesis that \nanti androgens contribute to feminization in \nwild fish could then be tested using statisti-\ncal modeling approaches. This was done by \nfirst fitting models for each of the biological \nresponses accounted for by estrogens and then \nestimating any additional effects that could be \nexplained by anti androgens.\nResponse: oocytes. We found 94 cases of \nfish with oocytes in their testes. The probability \nof oocytes in the testis of roach was correlated \npositively with the age of the fish (p < 0.0001), \nwith a sharp increase in the age-related effect \nFigure 2.

The steroidal estrogen E2 and its metabolite E1 were highly correlated (E2 is oxidized to E1). EE2 (the \ncontraceptive pill hormone) was also associated with E2, as expected. We found no correlation between the total estro-\ngenic (YES) and total antiandrogenic (anti-YAS) activities, indicating that the chemicals inducing these two hormonal \nactivities are likely to be different. \n*p < 0.05. ** p < 0.01. #p < 0.001.\nJobling et al.\n800 volume 117 | number 5 | May 2009 \u2022 Environmental Health Perspectives\nwhen the fish were \u2265 3 years of age. Multiple \nlogistic regressions on E1, E2, and EE2, con-\ntrolling for age, revealed that E1 was the most \nimportant predictor (p = 0.004) of oocytes \nand that no additional significant variation \nin the response could be explained by E2 or \nEE2 (for EE2, there were only 58 cases from \nsites with reliable estimates of EE2 concentra-\ntion). Because NP was highly correlated with \nE1, it accounted for no additional variation in \nthe response either. Interestingly, we found \nno correlation between the total estrogenic \nburden [yeast estrogen screen (YES)] and the \noocytes response. After allowing for E1 and age, \nhowever, there was a signifi cant correlation \nbetween anti androgenic activity (anti-YAS) \nand the oocytes response (p = 0.01). The surface \nplot suggested an additive effect of E1 and anti-\nYAS on the probability of oocytes (Figure 4). \nThis was confirmed by the non significant \nE1 \u00d7 anti-YAS inter action term (p = 0.37) in \nthe logistic regression model.\nResponse: fem.index. Of the 94 cases \nof fish with oocytes in their testes (fem.\nindex > 0), there were only 58 cases for which \nthere were robust measurements of EE2 in the \nWWTW effluents; this was insufficient for \nuse in further statistical analysis. Disregarding \nEE2, multiple logistic regressions on E1 and \nE2 revealed that E2 was the best predictor of \nfem.index (p = 0.02; averaged over all val-\nues of the anti-YAS variable), and there was \nno effect of NP (p = 0.78) or YES (p = 0.77) \non this response variable. As with the oocytes \nresponse, after allowing for the effects of E2, \nthe additional effect of anti-YAS over E2 on \nthe fem.index was significant (p = 0.01). The \nsurface plot suggested a somewhat non additive \neffect of E2 and anti-YAS on the fem.index \n(Figure 5). This was confirmed by a signifi-\ncant negative E2 \u00d7 anti-YAS interaction term \n(p = 0.02) in the logistic regression model.\nResponse: fem.duct. We found significant \nbetween-site variation (p < 0.0001) for the \nresponse fem.duct. As explained in \u201cMethods,\u201d \nwe accounted for this inter site variation before \ntesting for covariate effects. Multiple logistic \nregressions on E1, E2, and EE2 showed that, as \nwith the oocytes response, the overall effects of \nsteroidal estrogens on the probability of fem.\nduct was best explained by E1 (p < 0.002); \nagain, because NP was highly correlated with \nE1, it accounted for no additional variation in \nthe response. The additional combined effects \nof both YES and anti-YAS over E1 were, how-\never, significant (p = 0.006). The surface plot \nsuggested an increased probability of fem.\nduct with increased anti-YAS, but increased \nYES might partially suppress this response \n[Figure 6; see also Supplemental Material \n(available online at http:\/\/www.ehponline.org\/\nmembers\/2009\/0800197\/suppl.pdf)]. This \nwas confirmed by a significant negative YES \n\u00d7 anti-YAS interaction term (p = 0.01) in the \nlogistic regression model.\nResponse: VTG. We found significant \nbetween-site variation (p < 0.0001) in VTG. \nThis was mainly because fish were sampled \nthroughout the year and VTG varies with \nsampling month. After accounting for this, \nhowever, multiple logistic regressions on the \nsteroidal estrogens E1, E2, and EE2 showed that \nthe VTG response was best explained by E1 \nalone (p < 0.004). Over and above the steroi-\ndal estrogens, NP was a good predictor of the \nVTG response (p = 0.0002). Moreover, there \nwas a very significant effect of anti-YAS on the \nVTG response (p < 0.0001). A comparison of \nmodels fitted with all possible subsets of the \nthree variables NP, E1, and anti-YAS suggested \nthat NP and anti-YAS were jointly the best \npredictors of the VTG response, although the \ncontribution of NP was marginal (p = 0.09) \nover the overwhelming effect of anti-YAS on \nits own (p = 0.008). The surface plot suggested \nthat, in general, the VTG response increased \nwith increasing anti-YAS (Figure 7).\nWhen taken together, the results of the \nstatistical analyses suggested that male roach \nlikely exposed to the highest concentrations \nof antiandrogens and\/or steroidal estrogens \nexhibited the highest prevalence of both ovo-\ntestes and ovi ducts and the highest concentra-\ntions of vitellogenin. Moreover, the number of \ndeveloping oocytes in the testes of the intersex \nfish (defined by the feminization index) was \nalso the greatest in these fish.\nAnother important consideration is that, \nwith the exception of the feminization index, \nthe responses seen in the fish did not correlate \nwith the total estrogenic activity present in \nthe water samples as measured by the YES \nbio assay. Models of the interactions between \nthe total estrogenic activity and the total anti-\nandrogenic activity for each of the responses \nsuggested that estrogenic components of the \nmixture sometimes appeared to antagonize or \nreduce responses in the fish that were associ-\nated with anti androgen exposure.\nDiscussion\nThese findings support the hypothesis that \na combination of steroidal estrogens, nonyl-\nphenolic chemicals, and anti androgens \nare most likely to cause widespread sexual \nFigure 3.

Indeed, the likely influence of \nanti androgenic chemicals on each of the mea-\nsured responses is clearly demonstrated using \na modeling strategy that allows for the effects \nof steroidal estrogens first before interrogating \nthe data for the existence of additional causal \nfactors. This approach further strengthens the \nhypothesis that feminization results from the \neffects of both antiandrogens and estrogens \nacting in concert.\nSometimes, the antiandrogens appear to \nact additively with the estrogens to increase \na particular response (for oocytes and femi-\nnized ducts), whereas in other examples the \neffect of the anti androgens appears greater \nthan that of the estrogens (VTG in the blood \nplasma of males). For fem.duct, we found \nan inter action between the steroidal estro-\ngens and antiandrogenic activity, the estro-\ngens acting to decrease the response due to \nthe anti androgens. This does not necessarily \nimply that all of the factors were inter acting \nto produce a particular response at the same \ntime. Some of the responses (e.g., fem.duct) \nare induced during early development (e.g., \nRodgers-Gray et al. 2001), whereas others \n(e.g., oocytes) manifest themselves through-\nout life (Jobling et al. 2006). It is conceivable \nthat when additive relationships are seen, they \ncould be the result of a concentration-related \neffect of an initiator (acting during early life) \nand a promoter (acting during adult life).\nThe estrogenic activity of the water sam-\nples (as measured in the YES bioassay) did \nnot correlate well with any of the biological \nresponses or with the concentrations of indi-\nvidual steroidal estrogens measured in the \neffluents. In most cases, the combined estro-\ngenic activity of the steroidal estrogens pres-\nent in the effluents was predicted to be higher \nthan that actually measured using the YES \nbioassay. This lack of correlation between the \nYES assay results and the individual concen-\ntrations of steroidal estrogens could well have \nbeen due to the existence of anti estrogenic \ncompounds in some of the effluents, which \nwould reduce the response seen in the YES \nassay. Indeed the widespread existence of anti-\nestrogenic benzo triazoles in STW effluents, \nwhich are potent in the YES bioassay, has \nrecently been reported (Giger et al. 2006). \nMoreover, Harris et al. (2007) showed that \nbenzo triazoles were not anti estrogenic in fish, \neven though they were potent anti estrogens \nin the YES bio assay, thus providing a possible \nexplanation for the mis-match between the \nfish responses and the YES bio assay response. \nIndeed, the strong positive correlations of the \nbiological responses with the steroidal estro-\ngen concentrations but not the YES assay \nresults add credence to this suggestion.\nAlthough PCA indicated hetero geneity of \nanti androgens and estrogens across sites, there \nwere still correlations between some of the \ncovariates, and the multi colinearity exhibited \nby these co-occurrent contaminants sometimes \nconfounded the interpretation of the statistical \nanalyses. For example, NP was always highly \ncorrelated with E1 (Table 2) and so its asso-\nciation with any of the biological effects could \nrarely be separated from that of E1. However, \nwhen the strength of the association between \none of these parameters and a response was \nstronger than that of the other, it indicated that \nthe former was a more likely cause than the lat-\nter. Intuitively, strong associations are more \nlikely to be causal than weak ones (Hill 1965). \nMoreover, the statistical modeling strategy we \nadopted ensured that additional likely causal \nfactors (anti androgenic components) were \nidentified only after accounting for the effects \nof the main causal factors (steroidal estrogens).\nMulticolinearity could also account for \nthe possibility that none of the covariates \nwere causes of feminization in wild fish and \nthat they were masking the identity of an \nas yet unidentified chemical cause. In most \ncases, however, this possibility seems highly \nunlikely, as the association between the anti-\nandrogenic activity and the responses would \nappear strong enough to rule out hypotheses \nthat the associations are entirely due to one \nweak unmeas ured confounder or other source \nof modest bias. Moreover, given the fact that \nlaboratory experiments clearly show that \nexposure to anti androgens (e.g., Kiparissis \net al. 2003; Makynen et al. 2000) or steroi-\ndal or xeno estrogens (e.g., Seki et al. 2002; \nYokota et al. 2001) can cause sexual disrup-\ntion in fish, it seems plausible that chemi-\ncals with these mechanisms of action could \nalso cause effects in wild fish. For example, \ninter sexuality and vitellogenin induction can \nbe seen in fish exposed to concentrations of \nsteroidal estrogens in the low nanograms-\nper-liter range. Moreover, at least with the \nvitello genin response, combinations of steroi-\ndal (and other) estrogens have been shown to \nact additively to cause this effect (Brian et al. \n2005; Thorpe et al. 2003).\nAs with estrogenic activity, antiandrogenic \nactivity (given in flutamide equivalents) pre-\ndicted to be present in the rivers was often \nsufficient to induce biological responses in \nfish (Katsiadaki et al. 2006; Kiparissis et al, \n2003). In addition, molecular approaches \nstudying changes in gene expression have \nshown that the feminizing effects of estrogens \nand anti androgens in fish share both com-\nmon and distinct gene pathways (Filby et al. \n2007a, 2007b). It seems likely, therefore, \nthat mecha nisms exist by which combina-\ntions of estrogens and anti androgens could act \ntogether when they are administered in com-\nbination (Kortenkamp 2008), thus offering \nFigure 6.

The lower and upper surfaces represent 95% \nconfidence limits and the middle surface is the fitted \nmean. The plot indicates the additional combined \neffects of both YES and anti-YAS (p = 0.006) over E1 \non the probability of feminization of the reproduc-\ntive ducts in wild male fish. The surface plot sug-\ngested that there was an increased probability of \nfem.duct with increased anti-YAS, but that increased \nYES might partially suppress this response [see \nSupplemental Material, Figure 6A (available online \nat http:\/\/www. ehponline.org\/ members\/ 2009\/0800197\/\nsuppl.pdf) for two-dimensional plot].

The results also pro-\nvide an interesting parallel with the results of \nstudies performed in rodent models to inves-\ntigate the suspected environmental causation \nof testicular dysgenesis syndrome in humans, \nwhich is also thought to be mediated primar-\nily by anti androgenic combined with estro-\ngenic mechanisms rather than by estrogenic \nmechanisms alone (Christiansen et al. 2008; \nSharpe and Skakkebaek 2008; Skakkebaek \net al. 2001; Wolf et al. 1999).
