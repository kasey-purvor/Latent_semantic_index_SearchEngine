Hence there is a need for a more critical technological competence.\nIntroduction\nA review of the relevant literature strongly suggests that many, if not most, English as a\nSecond or Foreign Language (ESL\/EFL) teacher education programmes typically utilize\n53\nAbdelilah Salim Sehlaoui Developing cross-cultural communicative competence via computer-assisted language learning\nconcepts of culture and strategies for teaching and learning that are open to some cogent,\nbut constructive, critiques from the perspective of critical educational theory. In addition,\naccording to Wise (1995), throughout the last ten years the National Council for\nAccreditation of Teacher Education has required that colleges of teacher education must\nintegrate technology into their curricula. In fact, ESL\/EFL teacher education programmes\nare increasingly incorporating computer-based technologies and software into their\ncurricula. However, this integration is often done in ways that seem to leave unquestioned\nthe potential cultural and hegemonic ramifications of such technology (see, for example,\nBowers, 1988; Jones, 1995; Morton, 1996; Murray, 1997; Sehlaoui, 1999).\nThe purpose of this article is to argue for the need for a critical computer literacy in the\nprocess of developing cross-cultural communicative competence in English as a Second\/\nForeign Language (ESL\/EFL) pre-service teachers. To achieve this purpose, this article\npresents a brief theoretical framework, a data-based discussion of ESL\/EFL pre-service\nteachers' views and some classroom pedagogical implications.\nBackground information\nThe argument developed here is supported by the findings of a dissertation research\nproject. The primary purpose of this research project was to describe and analyse current\npractices in an MA TESOL (Teachers of English to Speakers of Other Languages)\nprogramme in terms of the programme's efforts to develop cross-cultural communicative-1\ncompetence in students enrolled in the programme. The term cross-cultural communicative\ncompetence will be referred to in this article as CCCC. The way in which CCCC is defined\nand developed within the programme was thus an important, but broad domain of\nenquiry. Within this overarching domain, the purpose of the research focused on the\nconceptualizations of culture utilized within the programme, the professional and cultural\nidentity formation processes that appear to be occurring, the characterization of students'\nanalyses of power relations and their own position within these relations, and the ways in\nwhich computer-based technologies are being increasingly incorporated as a part of these\nprocesses (Sehlaoui, 1999). This article focuses on the last component of this research\nproject, the role critical computer literacy plays in the process of developing CCCC in\nESL\/EFL pre-service teachers. Based on students' perspectives, beliefs and attitudes - as\ndescribed in Sehlaoui (1999) - data-based pedagogical suggestions will be made.\nMethodology\nA qualitative research framework was chosen for this study. In order to examine how the\ndevelopment of CCCC was being approached in the MA TESOL programme at a state\nuniversity in the USA, data were obtained by: (1) classroom observations in the three core\ncourses for which the instructor's and students' permission had been obtained, (2)\nquestionnaires given to graduate students who chose to participate in the study, (3) analysis\nof programme documents and materials such as syllabuses, software programmes used,\netc., and (4) semi-structured interviews with MA TESOL students who gave their consent.\nA domain\/thematic analysis, based on the initial research questions, was performed by\ngenerating categories and then themes from the answers given by the responders, the\nclassroom observations field notes data, and by examination of the written documents\n(Ely, Anzul, Friedman, Gamer and Steinmetz, 1991; Miles and Huberman, 1994).\n54\nALT-J Volume 9 Number 3\nParticipants\nThe total number of participants in this study was twenty-seven: nine males and eighteen\nfemales. Their age range was between twenty-three and forty-five. The participants were\nfrom ten different countries: China, Taiwan, USA, Belize, Japan, Korea, Argentina,\nThailand, Saudi Arabia and Jordan. The majority of participants (twenty-three) in this\nstudy came from a middle and upper-middle social class and only two from a low and\nlower-middle social class.\nSetting\nThe natural context in which the present research project was carried out is the English\nDepartment at a state university in the USA. The target programme was the MA TESOL\nprogramme, which focused on ESL\/EFL pre-service teachers and ESL\/EFL teacher\neducators' classroom learning\/teaching practice.\nA critical theoretical framework\nThe theoretical framework which guided the analyses and interpretations of data is\ngrounded in critical educational theories that have emerged from the field of multicultural\neducation and have often provided a basis for change in teaching and learning strategies\nrelating to cultural dynamics (Aronowitz and Giroux, 1993; Foley, 1990; Giroux, 1981;\nSleeter and Grant, 1999; Shannon, 1992; and Tidwell, 1993). In many ways, the proposed\nresearch was an attempt to draw together elements from the areas of multicultural\neducation and TESOL with an eye toward benefiting both of these fields of scholarship\nand practice. The special focus of this study on computer technology in the curriculum and'\nits implications for socio-cultural dynamics is a recognition of technology's increasing, and\noften unquestioned, role in socio-cultural processes.\nUntil quite recently, computer-assisted language learning (CALL) was a topic of relevance\nmostly to those with a highly specialized interest in that area. Recently, though, computers\nhave become so widespread in schools and homes of middle- and upper-class families\n(Lockard, Abrams and Many, 1997; Poole, 1997) and their uses have expanded so\ndramatically that the majority of language teachers must now begin to think about the\nimplications of computers for language learning and teaching (Warschauer, 1996). From a\ncritical perspective, it is important to recognize that computer use is non-neutral, in the\nmost basic sense, because not all students in a society have equal access to computers\n(Lockard et al., 1997). This will inevitably create a new category of 'haves' and 'have nots',\nusually along pre-existing lines of inequalities. According to McGrath, Thurston,\nMcLellan, Stone and Tischhauser (1992: 468), inequities in computer access have two\nimplications: 'First, the students affected will be educationally handicapped by the lack of\npowerful learning tools.. . Second, these students may find themselves at a disadvantage\nin their preparation for their future academic careers or jobs'.\nIn a more globally cultural sense, computer programs, according to Bowers (1988), carry\nwith them the inherent mechanical mode of thinking that underlies the western approach\nto science and technology. While western languages, especially English, have developed in a\ncomplex historical relationship to a positivist world-view, the form and structure (and\nphilosophical ethos) of many languages exist at odds with, or at least in a different\nrelationship with, more mechanistic structures and forms.\n55\nAbdelilah Salim Sehlaoui Developing cross-cuttural communicative competence via computer-assisted language learning\nPennington (1996) points out that while computer use in language learning can promote\npositive learning experiences, it can also encourage a form of anti-social behaviour. Like\nBowers and Pennington, Jones (1995) discusses the kind of culture that is being developed\nin what he calls 'cybersociety'. In other words, we need to be aware of the type of reality\nand world-view that computer-mediated communication (CMC) can bring with it. These\nauthors point out that we must be aware that instead of developing students' CCCC via\nemail and Internet, this computer use may be developing a new elite culture and fostering\nstudents' stereotypes and biases, especially when the focus is on cultural products rather\nthan process. Computer technology can hinder cross-cultural communication by exposing\nstudents and teachers to cultural material that can develop or strengthen stereotypes and\nprejudices rather than reduce or eliminate them.\nEducators' unawareness of these forms of non-neutrality can serve to reinforce further the\nhegemonic aspects of education, that is to say, the dominant culture will be strengthened\nand protected via computer technology, since it is the dominant social classes and their\ncultural forms that will both shape and benefit most from this technology. In other words,\nstructural inequalities will be perpetuated through both of these aspects. However, in spite\nof this sociocultural criticism, computer technology has offered the field of education a\npowerful tool for learning and teaching, and does hold some potential for the furtherance\nof processes of democratization.\nThe powerful contribution of CALL can be found in its potential for providing ways to\nconnect people and build communities, in offering opportunities for CCCC to be\ndeveloped and used, and for improving processes of democratization via CMC. However, a\nsociocultural criticism revealed that this powerful tool, like any other media, is non-\nneutral. The following section presents a data-based sociocultural analysis as it emerged\nfrom the research project by Sehlaoui (1999).\nA data-based sociocultural analysis: computer technology, culture\nand power\nComputer technology, culture and power emerged as a separate category in the research\nproject. This category addressed the following research question: how is computer\ntechnology discussed and conceptualized among students as part of their socialization\nprocess in the programme? How is this technology integrated in the TESOL programme?\nThe data collected by means of observation and document analysis did not contain any\nreference to CALL. This means that during all observation sessions of three core courses in the -\nTESOL programme, CALL was not among the topics discussed or studied (apart from a few\ninstances when one of the instructors mentioned to the students that he had sent an email\nmessage with some instructions and class announcements). Furthermore, the textbooks used\nin all three courses did not integrate CALL into their content (see, for example, Celce-Maurcia,\n1991; Gebhard, 1996; Ramirez, 1995; Samovar and Porter, 1994; Ur, 1996). These observations\nabout CALL in this particular programme are so significant because they corroborate the\nfindings in the other two resources, namely, the interview and questionnaire data.\nThree main themes emerged under this category in interview and questionnaire data: (1)\ncritical views and an awareness of cultural power relations in CALL, (2) uncritical views\nand a lack of awareness of cultural power relations in CALL, and (3) uses of metaphors in\n56\nALT-J Volume 9 Number 3\nCALL. These themes emerged in the data collected during the interviews with the\nparticipants, as well as their responses to the questionnaire.\nI. Critical views and awareness of cultural power relations in CALL\nThe following statement, by a student from Thailand, illustrates the critical views held by\nsome informants:\nNow most of Internet is used by rich people. People in schools and even now some\ncolleges do not have Internet. Internet can change a lot. It's creating the change. It's\ninfluencing our culture. You know when I was in my country I didn't know about it, but\nI know that it has good and bad sides. I mean good in transferring knowledge and bad\nbecause it encourages nudism in my country.\nThis echoes the attribute of 'double-edged sword' used by some participants in the study to\ndescribe the cultural changes in the world (see Sehlaoui, 1999). The same informant added:\n'OK, technology is one of the causes of this change. As a means of communication it helps\na lot in those changes.' Relating this to the hegemony of the English language and culture,\nanother informant raised the question of whether all the people using Internet should\nknow English. He explained:\nThe idea would be that they try to do this so that everything on the Internet should be in\nEnglish so that all the people should know English or should learn English. I would say\nthat the point of arabizing or electronic arabizing is difficult because it is not desirable\nfor the dominant culture . . . Electronic arabizing would be OK and accurate. It's\nnecessary to know the English language; therefore, the effort of arabizing is not\nencouraged because they want people to learn the American culture. If there is no\ntranslation, people will need to learn the English language and if they learn the\nlanguage they must learn the culture too.\nThis is another form of hegemony that supports the dominant culture, which has been\ndescribed as linguistic imperialism (Phillipson, 1992). Such cultural criticism as it relates to\ncomputer technology should become part of the TESOL curriculum. In another country,\nthe use of the Internet was explained by a participant who said that:\nthe system, as far as I know, is not working yet on a wide range. It's something closed for\nuniversity staff or something like that. The public cannot have access for using the\nInternet and if they can use it, it's expensive for them (people who cannot afford it). And\nas far as I know there are regulations for displaying material there. The information will\nbe filtered. It will be censored. Things like pornography. I think it's hard to control\npolitical information, though. It's not something like sex. The system itself will be\nprogrammed not to allow something like this to get through.\nFrom the USA a student said that:\nthe dominant culture has more access to it. Like I said the middle-upper income class.\nThose lower-income\/poverty class don't have access and I have seen that with my own\neyes . . . yeah. This closes the door to them, they can't improve socially and\neconomically. I see that in the future, this is gonna be more and more important in our\nlife, but the gap is gonna get larger and larger, especially when they don't teach\ntechnology and don't make it available.\n57\nAbdelilah Salim Sehlaoui Developing cross-cultural communicative competence via computer-assisted language learning\nThis supports the implications made by McGrath et al. (1992) about inequities in\ncomputer access.\nTwo different students (who apparently belong to two different socio-economic classes)\nexplained their experiences with computer technology as follows. One Saudi student said:\nFor example, I was browsing the Internet last night looking for some software for\nqualitative research and I found some of them that can code video-taped material and\neverything. I think this kind of software helps the researcher in doing all his\/her\nresearch, for example, in months or weeks, you can do that in 90% less time which is\ngood.\nIn contrast, a US student explained that\nwhen the university is closed down that has been a problem for me because I don't have\naccess to it at home. It's very frustrating. That was the one thing I was concerned about.\nI was still looking for a job and I was getting nearer and nearer to the end of the\nsemester and I was communicating with a lot of people through email and I was 'Oh my\nGosh! What am I gonna do?' And a friend offered that I could use her email but I have\nto drive twenty miles to get to her house.\n2. Uncritical views and a lack of awareness of cultural power relations in CALL\nAlthough the above participant showed an awareness of the issue of equity and\naccessibility of computers, she was not that critical about computer use in the classroom\nand in relation to CCCC and its cultural dynamics. The following statement illustrates this\nuncritical view:\nThe students can use it to learn all about other cultures on the Internet, type the name\nof the country and . . . I have not thought a lot about that. I would teach culture\nthrough Internet like if that was a course based on culture or maybe if I give an\nassignment on culture I would recommend the use of Internet maybe there might be a\nspecific site where they can explore other cultures. I'm not really sure how I would use it.\nThis statement also shows a lack of confidence in how to use computers in developing\nCCCC in EFL\/ESL contexts. This can be ascribed, partially, to the lack of training that\nESL\/EFL teachers have in this area (see, for example, Morton, 1996; Warschauer, 1996).\nThe following statement illustrates this further, when the informants were asked to describe\ntheir experiences with CALL:\nNot much. I have very little experience with computer technology. My abilities, that I\ndeveloped on my own, include word-processing, some understanding of email and\nInternet usage. My knowledge is very basic, though I would like to know more.\nAnother informant explained '[he is] learning a lot from computer technology on [his]\nown'. This informant's statement also shows that educational technology is still a weak\ncomponent for most ESL\/EFL educators, since most students said they were learning how\nto use computers on their own. This fact was confirmed by field note data and document\nanalysis data as mentioned before. This triangulation of data analysis also helped in\ntracing the conceptualizations of culture used in the participants' responses to the use of\nCALL in developing CCCC.\n58\nALT-} Volume 9 Number 3\nStatements about computer use in relation to cultural learning and teaching were also\nbased on the conceptualization of culture as country, too. Within this category the themes\nof computer neutrality and culture as country or artefact occurred. Culture is equated to\ncountry as is shown in the following statements about CALL. One participant stated: 'it's\nwonderful you can communicate across the boundaryless world, not knowing or caring if\nthe person is racially, ethnically, culturally the same or different from you. It gives students\na lot of practice in writing and understanding.' To illustrate this general perception of the\n'culture as country' and 'the neutrality of computers', one of the participants stated:\nWell, for me, it provides people with a way to communicate with people in other\ncountries or other cultures. Beyond that, I am not really sure. I do think that it's easier\nand more comfortable talking\/communicating with people who are different on the\ncomputer because you're not facing them, the differences can be ignored.\nThis is what Jones (1995) and Bowers (1988) addressed in their cultural criticism of educa-\ntional computing. The same uncritical views and perceptions were evidenced by the data\ncollected during a pilot study that anticipated this dissertation research project. In their\nresponses to the following statement, 'Computer technology can be used to develop CCCC\nbecause it is neutral', almost all participants (80 per cent) agreed that computer technology\nis neutral in the sense that has been discussed before in this article. Only 5 per cent\ndisagreed with the statement above, whereas 15 per cent had no opinion.\n3. Uses of metaphor in CALL\nAnother recurring theme in this study was that of metaphors used by participants to\ndescribe the role of computer technology in developing CCCC. These metaphors included:\n'the computer's ability to break down cultural walls', 'it [the computer] brings the world\ninto a small global village', 'it [the computer] brings your culture to the tips of your\nfinders', 'the Internet acts as a window to information about the cultures of the languages\nstudied'. The metaphors that were used or adopted by some informants while talking\nabout technology, during interviews, included: 'the world becoming a small village', 'I\nthink technology makes the world smaller as they call it \"a global village\"', 'computer and\nlanguage are tools'. In support of Murray's (1997) cultural criticism of the uncritical use of\nmetaphor in CALL, one of the participants said:\nI believe that computers and the Internet are changing our world and people from all\naround the global village are becoming closer. So intercultural communication is the\nfield of the future.\nThis statement is an example of the uncritical acceptance of 'the village' metaphor, that is,\na village comprised only of those who have access to computers (Murray, 1997).\nAccording to Murray (1997), as language educators, we need to unravel the metaphors\nused to talk about computer technology because the metaphors used constantly in our\neveryday language shape our understanding and view of the world. She points out that\nmany of the terms and metaphors used to describe the new technology, such as the ones\nused by the participants in the study reported in this article, lead us to ignore the social\ncontext in which the technology is introduced. Murray states that 'what these metaphors\nhide is the historical fact that the introduction of all new technologies is not socially or\nmorally neutral. It takes place in a social and cultural context that helps determine how it\n59\nAbdelitah Salim SeWaoui Developing cross-cultural communicative competence via computer-assisted language learning\nwill be used' (Murray, 1997: 4). One prevailing metaphor, discussed by Murray, is that of\nthe 'Information Superhighway'. This metaphor has become so common and so\nwidespread that many people are fascinated by the notion of unlimited access to\ninformation and communications. However, this metaphor also invokes ethical issues in the\nform of questions such as: \"Who will build the highway? Who will pay for its construction?\nWho will have access to it? Will it be a toll road or a freeway? Will travel be restricted,\ncontrolled? Who will police it?' (Murray, 1997:2).\nBeyond the language of critique\nWhat can be concluded from the above critiques is that, as people and as educators, we\nmust ensure that we do not see a particular metaphor as describing the way all human\nbeings think, but rather as determining how we view and use the technology. We must also\nbe able to see power struggle as a struggle over meaning and representation, that is, who\ndefines and assigns meaning. We must apply our knowledge and understanding about\nmultiple intelligences and learning styles as much to decisions we make about computer\nuse in our classrooms as we do to decisions about group work or visual aids. Besides, we\nneed to reflect on other metaphors used to describe the new technology, to deconstruct the\nmetaphors for ourselves and ensure that our pedagogical decisions are not based on flawed\nor insidious metaphors. This means that the questions of 'how, where, why, and by whom'\nthis computer technology is used are all legitimate to ask because, as noted by Riel (1990),\n'new tools alone do not create educational change. The power is not in the tool but in the\ncommunity that can be brought together and the collective vision that they share for\nredefining classroom learning.'\nFrom a critical perspective on the data, it can be seen that the prevailing tendency among\nESL\/EFL pre-service teachers has often been to deal with computer technology as a\nneutral tool and to ignore its role in the socio-economic, and political dynamics of culture.\nThe cultural strategy of appropriation is very useful in redefining and redirecting the use of\ncomputer technology for counter-hegemonic purposes (Tidwell, 1993). Data analysis\nshowed that the predominant tendency among participants in the TESOL programme was\nto reinforce further the hegemonic aspects of education via CALL. Hence, the suggestions\nfor improving the programme and the need for integrating a critical perspective (e.g.\nBowers, 1988; Jones, 1995; Morton, 1996; Murray, 1997; Pennington, 1996; and Wise,\n1995) into the use of CALL in TESOL teacher education programmes.\nThus, ESL\/EFL teachers need to be aware of the reality that computer technology brings\nwith it. Otherwise, instead of developing CCCC in the learner via email and Internet, this\nmode of computer use may foster students' stereotypes and biases, especially when the\nfocus is on cultural products rather than processes, and enhance existing disparities in\nterms of class, ethnic and gender privileges. The data reported in this article reinforce the\nview that most of the students feel that computer technology is neutral without a critical\nconsideration of its role in the socio-cultural dynamics of society. The following suggested\nrecommendations and classroom implications aim at improving the quality of CALL in\nthe TESOL teacher education programmes in their attempt to develop pre-service teachers'\nCCCC.\n60\nAa-J Volume 9 Number 3\nRecommendations and pedagogical implications\nTo provide ESL\/EFL learners with quality education on\/via computers, computer systems\n'should be viewed as structured learning environments with complex and comprehensive\ncapabilities to access and manipulate information' (Morton, 1996: 417). In addition to\nproviding accessibility and availability of updated hardware and software equipment, the\nrole of a supportive computer-based environment is to provide technical training and\nscaffolding for both ESL\/EFL learners and ESL\/EFL teachers to develop their critical and\neffective technological competence. The TESOL programme does not yet provide such\ntechnical training for all students, as was recognized by all participants in the study. As one\nof them remarked: 'Like I said I haven't had experience with technology in this program. I\nthink there is a lot to be explored yet.' In fact, CALL courses do not figure on the list of\ncore courses of this particular MA TESOL programme or on the list of elective courses.\nThis is why all participants (100 per cent) expressed their dissatisfaction with the way\ncomputer technology is being used in their programme.\nTo develop effective critical technological competence, TESOL teacher education\nprogrammes need to move beyond a view that embraces computer technology without\nquestioning its non-neutrality and without understanding its role in the socio-cultural\nprocesses. They also need to move beyond a view of computers as add-ons which also\nencourage traditional instructional strategies and exclude computer-based learning and\nteaching from the curriculum (Morton, 1996). One of the participants said: \"They have to\nuse pood technology, because I cannot imagine a program like that without having some\nintroductory courses to CALL, for example.' However, simply adding a computer or a\ncourse to a classroom or programme in a school has not ensured that the teachers use the\ntechnology effectively for the purpose of teaching and learning (Okolo, Bahr and Rieth,\n1993).\nComputer projects and classroom activities that democratize the educational process and\nhelp prospective teachers develop their CCCC are highly recommended. For example,\ncomputer use in on-line communication can result in community building, in which\nindividuals collectively solve problems and provide support for each other in a democratic\nand egalitarian manner (see, for example, Bruce, Peyton and Batson, 1993; Harris, 1993;\nRice-Lively, 1994; and Schrum, 1995). This type of communication, according to\nWarschauer (1996), can be asynchronous through tools such as email, which allow each\nparticipant to compose messages at their own time and pace, or synchronous (real time),\nusing programmes such as MOOs (Multi-user Object-Oriented) on-line communication. It\nalso allows not only one-to-one communication, but also one-to-many, allowing a teacher\nor student to share a message with a small group, the whole class, a partner class or an\ninternational discussion list of hundreds or thousands of people.\nComputer-mediated communication (CMC) allows users to share not only brief messages,\nbut lengthy documents as well. Using the Web, students can search through millions of\nfiles around the world within minutes to locate and access authentic materials and cultural\ninformation. Virtual Connections by Warschauer (1995) offers ESL\/EFL teachers and\nlearners a rich resource book in this regard. The 'New Ways in TESOL' (Boswood, 1997)\nseries provides an excellent source of classroom activities on how to use the computer in\nthe classroom for ESL\/EFL learners\/teachers. Other activity and strategy resources for\n61\nAbdelibh Salim Sehlaoui Developing cross-cuftural communicative competence via computer-assisted language learning\nintegrating CALL in the development of CCCC can be found in Heinich, Molenda,\nRussell and Smaldino (1999), Lockard et al. (1997), Morrison, Lowther and DeMeulle\n(1999), and Poole (1997).\nHowever, ESL\/EFL educators need to be cautious as to the selection of CALL software.\nWarschauer (1996) points out several major problems that have surfaced in the use of\nCALL software in language teaching programmes:\n\u2022 First, there is the question of quality of available programs. While some teachers them-\nselves can develop their own multimedia programs using authoring software such as\nHyperCard (for Macintosh) or Toolbook (for PC), most classroom teachers lack the\ntraining or the time to make even simple programs. This has left the field to commercial\nsoftware developers, who often do not base their programs on sound pedagogical\nprinciples, let alone consider critical emancipatory objectives related to CALL and its\nsocio-cultural dynamics, as discussed in this article.\n\u2022 Secondly, the cost for developing quality programs can price them out of the market of\nmost English teaching programmes.\n\u2022 Thirdly, some of today's computer programs are not yet intelligent enough to be truly\ninteractive. For example, one particular program used in this area {Dustiri) should\nideally be able to understand a user's spoken input and evaluate it, not just for\ncorrectness but for appropriateness as well.\nFinally it should be emphasized that EFL\/ESL teachers should be educated to become not\nonly critical intellectuals but transformative intellectuals as well (Giroux, 1981, 1992;\nMcLaren, 1998). In other words, they should base their classroom practice, in developing\nCCCC via CALL in students, on a critical view of culture that starts where the learners are\nand focuses on unequal relations of power and means to address inequalities. Besides, they\nshould not only know 'what and how to teach' but also 'why' they teach 'what' they teach\n'the way' they teach it (Edge, 1996; Crookes, 1997). In this way they will actively seek to\nempower themselves and their students to reconstruct society so that it better serves the\nneeds and interests of all groups of people. This is an especially cogent framework in this\nhistorical period known as the information age.\nReferences\nAronowitz, S., and Giroux, H. A.
