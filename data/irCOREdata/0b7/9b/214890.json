Early researchers were fairly sceptical about the benefits of online \nrelationships (Kraut et al. 1998; Sproull, & Kiesler, 1986). Those who subscribed to the \n\u2018cues-filtered out perspective\u2019, for instance argued that due to fewer non-verbal and \nparalinguistic cues, there is diminished feeling of social presence. That is, an individual\u2019s \nself-perception is reduced and deindividuation is encouraged. In the absence of typical \nsocial context cues, such theorists contended that communication can become \nincreasingly uninhibited and aggressive (e.g., as evident in flaming). However, despite all \nthe early negativity researchers across the globe have found ample evidence that people \ndo make friends and initiate romantic relationships in cyberspace and often these \nrelationships progress offline (Dutton & Helsper, 2007; Whitty, 2008). While we are left \nin little doubt that people can and do form relationships online, we know little about \nwhich role the internet plays in intimate offline relationships (Tong & Walther, in press). \nObviously, this is important given that the internet has become another mode of \ncommunication in many people\u2019s everyday lives. The widespread integration of ICTs into \ninteractions with others could mean that partners have started to establish (unspoken) \nrules of conduct or etiquettes about online behavior. We label these rules about what is \nacceptable and not acceptable online netiquette. \n This study was interested to learn more about how married couples perceive the \nuse of the internet within their relationships. We wanted to learn more about couple\u2019s \nNetiquette within Married Couples     2 \n \nexpectations of each others\u2019 online activities and if some online activities were seen as \ntaboo. There is very little known about how partners evaluate online activities and \nwhether this has become something that is part of marital conduct and evaluation. \nFurthermore, we were interested in how couples use the internet to monitor each others\u2019 \nonline activities. These aspects are important in light of an increase in online counseling \nand matchmaking services as well as an increased awareness of excessive internet use \nand the impact this has on people\u2019s lives and interactions with others.  This study will \nfurther our understanding about whether internet use has become an important area of \nnegotiation and defining intimate relationships. \nMarried couples\u2019 use of the internet \n There is a dearth of research on married couples\u2019 use of the internet, especially \nwith regards to their use of it to develop and maintain their relationships. We know even \nless about couple\u2019s expectations of each other\u2019s internet usage. \nSipior, Ward and Marzec (2002) reported that in the US married couples with \nchildren aged 17 or younger use the internet the most. Likewise, in the UK adults with \nchildren in the household have greater interest, awareness and skills in relation to \ntechnologies including the internet (Ofcom, 2006; Helsper & Dutton, 2007). This is likely \ndue to a filter down process whereby ICT savvy children who use the internet motivate \ntheir parents to do the same or because parents acquire ICTs because their children need \nthem for school and end up using them themselves (VanRompaey, Roe & Struys, 2002). \nMost of the studies which interview married individuals therefore discuss how the \ninternet is used to manage relationships between parents and children (Gross, 2004; \nNetiquette within Married Couples     3 \n \nLivingstone & Bober, 2004) but do not address how parents use the internet within their \nadult relationships. \nThere is evidence that people develop and maintain intimate relationships with \nothers through the use of the internet. For example, Wolak, Mitchell, and Finkelhor \n(2003) found that 14% of 1,501 ten to seventeen year olds reported close online \nfriendships and 2% claimed to have established online romances. Whitty and Gavin \n(2001) found that individuals form friendships in chat rooms and perhaps more \ninterestingly that some of these participants preferred that they remain online (see also \nWhitty & Carr, 2006a). Helsper, Dutton and Whitty (2008) report that in the UK 6% of \nmarried internet users have met their partner online. The most likely meeting places for \nthese couples were online dating sites (32%), instant messaging (20%) and chat rooms \n(17%). \nMarried couples in the offline world \nThere is extensive psychological research on the characteristics of married \ncouples in the offline world. Contrary to the popular belief that opposites attract, most \nresearch finds that in general it is those who are similar that form long-lasting romantic \nrelationships (Condon & Crano, 1988; Sprecher, 1998). The similarity between partners \nis not due to assimilation between the partners over the duration of the marriage but to \n\u2018selective mating\u2019 or \u2018assortative selection\u2019 at the meeting stage (Feng & Baker, 1994; \nGalbaud du Fort, Kovess, & Boivin, 1994; Price & Vandenberg, 1980). That is, these \nsimilarities already exist at the very beginning of the relationship instead of developing \nover the course of the relationship. In establishing a romantic relationship, similarity of \ninterests, attitudes and values are seen as more important attributes than similarity in \nNetiquette within Married Couples     4 \n \nsocio-demographic characteristics (Sprecher, 1998). This similarity does not restrict itself \nsolely to attitudes and values, as behavioral patterns also often coincide. The literature on \naddiction has shown that people who abuse substances or report addictive behaviors are \nmore likely than others to have a long term relationship with someone who has the same \ntype of problematic behavior (Grant et al., 2007; Homish, Leonard, & Cornelius, 2007; \nLadd & Petry, 2002; McLeod, 1993a; Olmsted, Crowell, & Waters, 2003; Schuckit et al., \n2002; Shaw et al., 2007). Homish and Leonard (2005) showed, for example, that \nsimilarity between partners in the level of alcohol consumption was related to greater \nmarital happiness, particularly in young couples.  \n When evaluating a partner\u2019s behavior or values an individual often sees their \npartner as more similar to themselves than they actually are. This projection heuristic \nleads to \u2018\u2026a strong tendency for spouses to use their own feelings as a reference for \npredicting their partner\u2019s feelings\u2019 (p.1, Sillars, Pike, Jones & Murphy, 1984; see also \nRuvolo & Fabin, 1999). Since projection leads to a greater perceived similarity between \nthe partners and greater similarity is related to marital happiness, projection can \nstrengthen a relationship. Studies have found a positive relationship between marital \nadjustment and accurately understanding the attitudes, views and expectations of one\u2019s \npartner (Ickes, Dugosh, Simpson & Wilson, 2003). However, seeking out information \nabout one\u2019s partner is not always good for a relationship. Ickes et al. (2003) found that \ndating partners who are highly motivated to acquire relationship-threatening information \nare more likely to break up. Afifi, Dillow, and Morse (2004) found similar results but \nsuggest that these results are \u201caffected by the communication directness with which that \nmotivation is enacted\u201d (p.445). \nNetiquette within Married Couples     5 \n \nPrevious research thus suggests that partners within a marriage are likely to have \nthe same values and behavioral patterns (McLeod, 1993a, 1993b). We thus could expect \npartners within married couples will have similar ideas about what types of online \nbehavior are acceptable, what type of internet user their partner is and what the norms are \nfor monitoring behavior.  \nGender differences and online activity \nBased on existing research about offline relationships it is clear that partners within \nmarried couples show high levels of similarity in their values and attitudes and it would \nbe logical to extend this argument to online behaviors and attitudes about the internet. \nNotwithstanding these high levels of similarity, married couples are made up of two \nindividuals and the individual characteristics of the partners will likely lead to different \napproaches to the internet. Thus while partners in married couples are likely to be more \nsimilar to each other than they are to people outside their relationship, differences within \nthis unit will exist. One characteristic that distinguishes partners within a marriage is \ngender and the literature does suggest that men and women use the internet differently \n(Jackson et al, 2001; Selwyn 2007; Tsai and Lin, 2004; Warner & Pocciano, 2007). The \nbiggest differences can be found in breadth of use, with women showing a narrower use \nof the internet than men (Ono & Zavodny 2003; Wasserman & Richmond-Abbot 2005). \nMoreover, research has found that women are more likely to have lower computer self-\nefficacy and less positive internet attitudes (Durndell & Haag, 2002; Hargittai & Shafer, \n2006; Imhof, Vollmeyer, & Beierlein, 2007). This corresponds to lower confidence levels \nof women in other technical and hard science related areas (Bandura & Locke, 2003; \nLucey et al. 2003). The lower confidence levels that women report has been shown to be \nNetiquette within Married Couples     6 \n \nlargely independent from their actual skill level and to be instead related to perceptions of \nwhat men and women are supposed to be good at or what they are supposed to like doing \n(Busch, 1995; Durndell & Haag, 2002; Selwyn, 2007) \nMost activities that have been associated with internet addiction (i.e., gambling, \ngaming and pornography), are undertaken more frequently by men than women. \nLivingstone and Helsper (2007) surveyed 1,511 children and their parents and found that \nyoung men tended to take more contact and content risks online and used the internet \nmore often for purposes, such as pornography, gaming and gambling. Other studies \nregarding online transactions show that men are less concerned about online risks. \nGarbarino and Strahilevitz (2004) found that women estimated privacy and economic \nrisks in online transactions to be more likely than men. This corresponds to offline \nbehavior in which men have been found to be greater risk takers and less worried about \nthe social consequences of this behavior (Traeen, Nilsen, & Stigum, 2006). Women have \nrepeatedly been shown to have higher levels of worry and concern than men in a wide \nrange of circumstances (Lewinsohn et al., 1998; McCann, Stewin, & Short, 1991; \nRobichaud, Dugas, & Conway, 2003; Stavosky & Borkovec, 1988). Notwithstanding \nthese differences in risk taking and worry offline, research by Dutton and Shepherd \n(2006) showed that women did not differ from men in their perception of the online risks \nrelated to privacy. The Dutton and Shepherd (2006) study might differ from the other \nresearch because this study focused on generalized instead of on personalized, every day \nrisks related directly to individuals or their significant others. \nUnacceptable online behaviors \nNetiquette within Married Couples     7 \n \n There is evidence to suggest that men and women believe that their partner should \nnot engage in certain types of online activities. In fact, some online activities are deemed \nby many to be acts of infidelity (Mileham, 2007; Whitty, 2003a, 2005; Whitty & Quigley, \nin press). In Whitty\u2019s survey of 1,117 individuals it was found that behaviors such as \ncybersex (defined as two or more individuals engaging in private discourse about sexual \nfantasies, typically accompanied by sexual self-stimulation) and \u2018hotchatting\u2019 (defined as \nan online interaction that moves beyond light-hearted flirting) were believed by the \nmajority of participants to be acts of infidelity. Parker and Wampler\u2019s (2003) study found \nthat interacting in adult chat rooms and engaging in cybersex were rated by \nundergraduate students as acts of betrayal.  \n Emotional online betrayal, such as falling in love or self-disclosing intimate \ndetails about oneself or one\u2019s partner online are also seen by many to be serious \nrelationship transgressions (Whitty, 2003a, 2005). As with research on offline infidelity \nand jealousy, gender differences have been reported as regards to which acts men and \nwomen believe are more severe or upsetting. Whitty (2005) found that women, more than \nmen, mentioned emotional betrayal in their stories of cyber-infidelities. She also found \nthat women were more likely than men to write that they would end the relationship if \nthey found out their partner was having an internet affair. Parker and Wampler\u2019s (2003) \nstudy, which considered sexual online activities, found that women viewed these \nactivities more seriously than men did. Whitty\u2019s (2003a) study further found that overall \nwomen were more likely than men to believe that online sexual acts were an act of \nbetrayal. In this current study we were also interested in examining what types of online \nbehaviors men and women considered to be inappropriate. In addition to considerations \nNetiquette within Married Couples     8 \n \nof acts of infidelity, we investigated expectations in regards to the amount of time each \nother spent online, and whether other activities that have been linked to internet addiction \nsuch as gaming, shopping and gambling were perceived to be acceptable. To round up the \npicture of perceptions of online behaviors within intimate relationships, we wanted to \nexamine surveillance of online behavior within the couple and the gender differences \ntherein. \nHypotheses in relation to netiquette \nThe aim of this paper is to understand whether partners within married couples \nhave similar ideas about netiquette. This is similar to what social psychologists would \nrefer to as social scripts or rules within relationships, but in this case refers to rules or \nsocial scripts with regards to internet usage. The little research that has been conducted \non netiquette has, in the main, focused on work relationships. For instance, Whitty and \nCarr (2006b) examined the types of emails that workers deemed appropriate to send and \nreceive in the workplace. However, at present, we know little about the rules that couples \nnegotiate with regards to online communication. Therefore, to examine whether or not \npartners within married couples develop a similar set of ideas about internet use. A \nrelated aim is to understand if differences in netiquette can be explained by gender \ndifferences, in other words, do husbands and wives have different ideas about what is \nacceptable behavior in a partner? \nBased on the literature two hypotheses were developed about the acceptability of \nonline activities within intimate relationships. These are necessarily descriptive in nature \nsince little research exists about the establishment of netiquettes in married couples. \nHowever, based on offline relationship literature one can assume that married couples \nNetiquette within Married Couples     9 \n \ndevelop (unspoken) rules about what type of behavior is acceptable and assume that these \nare shared amongst both partners (Murray et al., 2002).  \nH1. Partners within married couples share similar views about what types of \nbehaviors are acceptable and not acceptable online.  \nBased on the literature that shows that women have higher levels of concern about \nbehaviors that might be considered inappropriate or risky (e.g. Robichaud, Dugas, & \nConway, 2003), and because previous research shows that women are more likely to \nregard online infidelity as serious problems (Parker & Wampler, 2003; Whitty 2005) we \nfurther hypothesize that: \nH2. When there is disagreement within a couple about internet use that could be \nconsidered problematic (ie. excessive use, online infidelity or addictive online \nactivities), women are more likely to than men to consider this behavior \nproblematic.   \nMonitoring spousal behavior \nGiven that men and women, in the main, expect their partners to be monogamous \nit is perhaps not surprising that some people from time to time monitor their partner to \nensure their fidelity. This is sometimes referred to in the literature as \u2018mate guarding\u2019. \nBuss (1988), for example, identified male \u2018mate guarding\u2019 behaviors, including taking \ntheir partner away from a social gathering where other men are present, dropping by \nunexpectedly to check on their partner, and insisting that their partner stay at home rather \nthan going out and potentially meeting other men (see also Buss & Shackelford, 1997). \nMost of this research is focused on male mate guarding and extremer forms of mate \nguarding that involve abuse. After a review of the literature we found no gender \nNetiquette within Married Couples     10 \n \ncomparative studies on the issue of everyday, lower-level surveillance activities. There is \neven less clarity about these types of behavior online. \nPrevious research does show that, in general, individuals are often motivated to \nuncover information about their spouse, sometimes even when the information is \nrelationship-threatening. The internet presents individuals with a new tool to check on a \nspouse\u2019s activities and hidden thoughts or feelings (Whitty, 2003b; Whitty & Carr, \n2006a). If computers are left unattended or if one knows a spouse\u2019s password then emails \ncan be checked and browser history can be monitored. In this study we examined whether \nmen and women monitor their spouse\u2019s online activities. \nHypotheses in relation to monitoring \nIf certain behaviors are considered problematic within a relationship it is plausible \nto assume that in some couples this will lead to partners monitoring each other\u2019s \nactivities. Other research on positive and negative behaviors\u2019 and attitudes\u2019 suggests that \nlike marries like (Buu et al., 2006; Feng & Baker, 1994; Homish & Leonard, 2005; \nHomish et al., 2007; Mascie-Taylor, 1987, 1989; Price & Vandenberg, 1980; Russell & \nWells, 1991; White & Hatcher, 1984). A review of the literature suggests that there is no \nresearch that examines similarities and differences in surveillance behaviors within \nintimate relationships. Therefore, based on findings as regards other behavioral \nsimilarities, we tentatively hypothesize that the levels and types of surveillance behavior \nare similar in both partners in the couple. \nH3. Individuals within married couples have similar patterns of monitoring their \npartner\u2019s behavior. \nNetiquette within Married Couples     11 \n \nAs a consequence of the dearth of offline research on monitoring between partners, there \nis also little known about the gender differences in surveillance and no research, that we \nare aware of, which deals with this issue in relation to the internet. We decided to follow \nthe reasoning proposed earlier for gender difference in the evaluation of different online \nactivities. We expect women to be more concerned about a wide range of online \nbehaviors than men. As a consequence, we expect women to be more likely to take action \nto mitigate this feeling by monitoring their husband\u2019s behavior. Therefore, we predict \nthat: \nH4. When there is a discrepancy between couples in terms of surveillance, women \nare more likely to monitor their husband\u2019s behavior than men are to monitor their \nwives. \nThe paper thus focuses both on the existence of a shared netiquette in married \nrelationships and on the gender differences that one might find in the evaluation and \nsurveillance of partner behavior. \nMethod \nThe \u2018Me, My Spouse and the Internet\u2019 study collected data in October and November \n2007 through an online survey with married couples who used the internet. An \nindependent market research company, ICM Research, contacted its panel of internet \nusers to draw a representative sample of the UK population. The panel consists of \n100,000 individuals recruited through a nationally representative telephone omnibus \nsurvey in the UK which runs twice weekly among 1,000 adults. Other sources are also \nused to recruit panellist, such as recruitment via other websites. Through these methods \nNetiquette within Married Couples     12 \n \nICM has constructed a panel that consists of a representative sample of the UK \npopulation. \n A total of 6,012 married individuals were approached to answer the survey. Once \nthe first partner of a couple had completed the questionnaire their partner was contacted \nand asked to participate in the study. The response rate was 40% and the final sample \nconsisted of 2,401 individuals who completed more than 90 percent of the survey and \n992 couples in which both partners completed the questionnaire. Each person was \nguaranteed anonymity, neither their partner nor third parties could identify them by their \nanswers. Participants were able to drop out at any point during the survey process and ask \nfor their individual data to be removed from the database. Couples received an incentive \nafter both partners had completed the survey. This incentive was the equivalent of \u00a320 \nand consisted of a contribution towards an account that panelists opened when they \nstarted participating in the panel, whenever the account reaches \u00a350 the panelist is send a \ncheck for the same value.  \nThe data were weighted based on the OxIS surveys\u2019 (Dutton & Helsper 2007) \nestimates of married internet users in Britain; age and income levels were used to \nconstruct the weight. Because the survey aimed to research heterosexual couples the \nsample of couples consisted of 50% men and 50% women. The sampling strategy used \nwas designed to ensure the sample was representative of the British internet using \npopulation. In the final sample, 34% had finished or was currently in basic (secondary) \neducation, 36% had further education and 27% in university education. On average the \nindividuals had 1.6 children, 24% had no children. The average age of the participants \nwas 49 years old and had been married on average for 19 years. \nNetiquette within Married Couples     13 \n \nMeasures  \nThe final survey built on a survey conducted earlier in the US by eHarmony, an online \nmatchmaking company, who developed the survey to measure marital happiness, \nincluding questions related to marital satisfaction and psychological characteristics of the \nparticipants. For the study described in this paper questions were added in relation to \ninternet use and the role of the internet in marital relationships. This paper will focus on \ntwo issues; that of netiquette and surveillance. Since husbands and wives were \ninterviewed, statistics were used that are appropriate for matched pairs sampling \nprocedures. McNemar\u2019s test was used for comparison of contingency tables and paired t-\ntests were used for scale comparisons. When comparing proportion scores for two \ndifferent items, a normal z-test for equal proportions was used. When using kappa to test \nagreement between partners about the acceptability of online behaviors we considered a \nkappa above .21 to indicate \u2018fair\u2019 agreement (Landis & Koch, 1977; Sim & Wright, \n2005). Instead of just ordinary kappa to estimate agreement, we used maximum kappa as \nan indicator of highest possible level of agreement to correct for the high skew in the \nscales. \nNetiquette \nNetiquette in this paper is operationalised as the (unspoken and spoken) rules \nabout acceptable and unacceptable online activities. Social psychologists would use the \nterm \u2018social scripts\u2019 developed between couples (see for example, Fitness, 2001); \nhowever, given that we were only referring to rules about online activities we opted to \nuse the phrase \u2018netiquette\u2019. Netiquette was measured in relation to general internet use \nNetiquette within Married Couples     14 \n \n(that is the time spend online) and specific online behaviors (that is different types of \nonline infidelity and entertainment related behaviors).  \nThe question about netiquette in relation to general use asked: \u2018Do you ever feel \nthat you spend too much time on the Internet?\u2019 Participants were also asked to evaluate \ntheir partner\u2019s behavior through the question \u2018Do you feel that your partner spends too \nmuch time on the Internet?\u2019. \nIn order to measure the concept of netiquette in each partner we asked the \nparticipants to evaluate ten specific behaviors through the question \u2018How would you feel \nif your partner engaged in the following activities on the Internet?\u2019. The answer \nalternatives were \u2018unhappy\u2019, \u2018don\u2019t care\u2019 and \u2018happy\u2019 for all these activities. The ten \nactivities could be subdivided into emotional infidelity (\u2018falling in love\u2019, \u2018sharing \npersonal information\u2019, \u2018disclosing intimate details about themselves\u2019, and \n\u2018communicating relationship troubles to others\u2019), sexual infidelity (\u2018cybersex\u2019, \u2018flirting\u2019, \nand \u2018looking at pornography\u2019) and other potentially problematic behaviors (\u2018gambling\u2019, \n\u2018gaming\u2019 and \u2018shopping\u2019).  \nSurveillance \nTo measure partner surveillance we asked respondents \u2018Have you ever checked \nup on your partner\u2019s activities without them knowing, by doing the following?\u2019 They \nwere asked to answer this question for six different types of monitoring activities: \n\u2018Reading their emails\u2019, \u2018Reading their SMS\u2019, \u2018Checking their browser history\u2019, \u2018Reading \ntheir IM logs\u2019, \u2018Using monitoring software\u2019, and \u2018By pretending to be another person\u2019.  \nFindings \nNetiquette within Married Couples     15 \n \nIn this section, the answers of both partners are analysed to understand if similar \nnetiquette and surveillance patterns exist between partners. Simple descriptive analyses \ndemonstrate whether two partners were similar (partner similarity) in their ideas and \nbehavior and whether or not the image their partner had of them corresponds to the image \nthat they had of themselves (partner congruence). \nNetiquette: Internet use  \n--Table 1 about here-- \nTable 1 shows that in over half of the couples the partners had similar perceptions \nabout how much time they spent using the internet. The most common occurrence was \nthat both partners within the couple thought that their own use was unproblematic (45%). \nIn 12% of the couples both partners evaluated themselves to spend too much time online. \nThis means that in total 57% of the couples consisted of partners with similar (self-\nevaluated) patterns of internet use.  In 43% of the couples there were dissimilarities, with \none of the partners evaluating their own behavior as problematic, while the other partner \nevaluated their own behavior as unproblematic. The wife\u2019s evaluation of her own use and \nthe husband\u2019s evaluation of his own use were not significantly related (\u03c72(1)=1.66, p = \n.11, McNemar p = .34 ).  This indicates that there was no significant partner similarity; \nthat is, a person who perceived their own behavior as problematic was just as likely to \nhave a partner who considered their own behavior as unproblematic as they were to have \na partner who considered their own behavior as problematic. \nIf these self-evaluations were correct this would mean that in just under half of the \ncouples in our sample one of the partners had difficulties managing the time they spent \nonline while the other partner did not. To understand whether there is conflict in the \nNetiquette within Married Couples     16 \n \nperceptions that partners have about the time spent online in their relationship it is useful \nto examine the level of agreement between partners about the behavior of one of the \npartners. If a person, who is perceived by their partner to be spending too much time \nonline, does not agree with their partner\u2019s evaluation this could be a potential source of \nconflict.  \n---Table 2 about here--- \nTable 2 indicates that partners in most cases agreed over whether or not one of the \npartners had a problem with the time they spent online. There was agreement about the \nbehavior of the husband in 77% of the cases and agreement about the behavior of the \nwife in 75% of the cases. McNemar\u2019s test for equivalence in matched pairs indicates that \nthere was agreement between husbands and wives over the time the husband spent online \n(\u03c72(1)= 225.23; p < .01; McNemar p < .01). Similarly, there was agreement between \nspouses about the evaluation of the time the wife spent online (\u03c72(1)= 175.33; p < .01; \nMcNemar p < .01). The conclusion is therefore that there was partner congruence when \nevaluating both the wife\u2019s and the husband\u2019s behaviors.  \nIn addition, there was a significant relationship between the evaluation of the \nextent of time management problems of the wife and the husband (McNemar \u03c72(6)= \n20.08, p < .01). When a husband and wife thought a husband\u2019s behavior was problematic \nthey also tended to agree that the wife\u2019s behavior was problematic (in 5% of couples) \nand, similarly, when both thought that a wife\u2019s behavior was unproblematic they also \nagreed that the husband\u2019s behavior is unproblematic (31% of couples).  \nNetiquette within Married Couples     17 \n \nNevertheless, a z-test of two proportions shows that there were more married \ncouples which judged the time the husbands spent online as problematic (24%) than \ncouples who judged the time the wife spent online problematic (18%) (z=3.16; p < .01).  \nWhen the partners disagreed about the extent to which the time spent online was \nproblematic, the gender of the evaluator and not the gender of the evaluatee was \nimportant in understanding the nature of the disagreement. Table 2 shows that in 15% of \nall couples the husband said he did not spend too much time online while his wife did \nthink he had a problem. This equated to 63% (N=127) of the couples who disagreed \nabout the amount of time the husband spend online (24% of total; N=209). When the \npartners were evaluating the wife\u2019s behavior, in only 8% of all couples the wife thought \nher use was unproblematic while the husband thought she did use the internet too much. \nThis equated to 33% (N=72) of the couples who disagreed about the wife\u2019s behavior \n(25% of total; N=228). In twice as many couples (16%) the wife thought she spent too \nmuch time online when the husband did not think she had a problem. The proportion of \nwomen that were more concerned about their own behavior than their husband and the \nproportion of women that were more concerned about their husband\u2019s behavior than their \nhusbands was not significantly different (z=-0.87; p = .39). Thus, women viewed their \nown and their husband\u2019s behavior as more problematic than their husband did.  \nNetiquette: Specific activities \n---Table 3 about here--- \n.Descriptive statistics (see Table 3) show that the highest percentage agreement \nbetween partners was found for those activities that have been labeled \u2018infidelity\u2019 (see for \nexample, Whitty, 2005). In 90% of couples both partners were unhappy for the other \nNetiquette within Married Couples     18 \n \npartner to fall in love with someone else online, and 84% of couples both were unhappy \nfor the other engaging in cybersex. For the other infidelity online behaviors the level of \nagreement ranged between 69% of couples who were unhappy (flirting online) to 79% of \ncouples unhappy with the behavior (disclosing intimate details about themselves). Only \nin the case of potentially addictive online behaviors were there couples in which both \npartners were happy about the other engaging in a specific activity. \nMore couples disagreed about the level of acceptability of their partner engaging \nin entertainment or potentially addictive activities than about the acceptability of online \ninfidelity. The largest number of couples disagreed about the acceptability of looking at \nsexual material (59% agrees, 36% disagrees), followed by high disagreement about \nonline gaming (56% agrees, 35% disagrees), gambling (67% agrees, 19% disagrees) and \nshopping (53% agrees, 32% disagrees). In addition, a high percentage of couples did not \ncare whether or not their partner undertook the entertainment related behaviors (i.e. \ngambling [11%], gaming [37%], and shopping [23%]).  \nAn examination of the average evaluations of the acceptability of the different \nbehaviors through t-tests shows that infidelity related to falling in love and disclosing \nintimate details were not evaluated significantly different by partners (see Table 3). There \nwere significant differences in their evaluations of cybersex (t= 3.15; p < .01), sharing \npersonal information (t= 6.16; p < .01) and communicating relationships troubles (t= \n3.80; p < .01). As regards entertainment related behaviors there was a significant \ndifference between husbands\u2019 and wives\u2019 evaluations for gambling and viewing adult \nsites but not for gaming and shopping. Thus, percentage and average agreements give a \ncontradictory picture as regards similarity in netiquette between husbands and wives. \nNetiquette within Married Couples     19 \n \n\u2018True\u2019 agreement is better measured through kappa (Sim & Wright, 2005). Due to \nthe very high occurrence of the \u2018unacceptable\u2019 evaluation as regards infidelity behaviors \nas indicated by the prevalence index (see Table 4), finding high percentage agreements is \nnot extraordinary for these activities. That is, the chance that anyone considers these \nacceptable is very low and thus two individuals are bound to agree that the behavior is \nunacceptable independent of them being in a relationship. In these types of cases, kappa \ngives a better indication than percentage agreement of whether the agreement within the \ncouple is greater than the agreement between to random individuals.  \n---Table 4 about here--- \nTable 4 shows the kappas related to the agreement between partners about the \nacceptability of infidelity and entertainment activities. Kappa takes into consideration the \ndistribution of evaluations within the population and thus indicates whether two raters \nagree more than would be expected based on the distribution within this population. \nTable 4 shows that most entertainment behaviors obtained agreement scores ranging from \n\u2018fair\u2019 (sexual material; kappa=.32 and gaming; kappa=.31) to \u2018moderate\u2019 (gambling; \nkappa=.44). The agreement scores were lower for infidelity behaviors, ranging from \u2018fair\u2019 \nfor cybersex  (kappa=.33), flirting  (kappa=.29), and disclosing intimate details about \nthemselves (kappa=.28) to only \u2018slight\u2019 agreement for the other infidelity behaviors. Thus \npartner agreement for entertainment related behaviors was statistically stronger than \npartner agreement for infidelity related behaviors. The proportionality of kappa under \nkappa max takes into consideration the marginals,  that is the highest possible agreement \nbased on all the answers given, and is thus appropriate considering the skewed structure \nof the data. When using the maximum kappa as an indicator of the highest possible \u2018true\u2019 \nNetiquette within Married Couples     20 \n \nagreement between two individuals, proportionally, gambling (.51), cybersex (.45), and \nviewing adult sites (.48) continue to have the highest real levels of agreement and the \nemotional infidelities the lowest levels of agreement (see table 4). The bias index shows \nthat not only do the within couple evaluations correlate highly they also tend to be a \nsimilar in level. \nIt was hypothesized that when the couples disagreed it was likely that the wife \nwould be more concerned about the behavior than her husband. Table 5 shows the \npercentage of couples in which either the husband or the wife was happy for their partner \nto undertake a certain activity while their partner was either unhappy or did not care if \nthey undertook that same activity. \n---Table 5 about here--- \nWhen partners disagreed about the acceptability of online activities it was most \nfrequently the wife who was the least happy with her partner undertaking this activity. \nThese differences are largest for the (stereotypically) \u2018male\u2019 behaviors (gaming, \ngambling, and looking for sexual material). For example, in 25% of the couples the men \nwere happy for their wives to look at sexual material while their wives were \u2018unhappy\u2019 or \n\u2018don\u2019t care\u2019 about what their husband did. On the other hand only 7% of couples showed \nthe reverse relationship, in these couples the women were \u2018happy\u2019 for their husband to \nundertake these types of activities while their husbands said they would be \u2018unhappy\u2019 or \n\u2018don\u2019t care\u2019 about their wives undertaking these behaviors. The z-tests for two \nproportions shows that these gender differences were significant for all infidelity \nbehaviors except for falling in love and disclosing intimate details about the self (see \nTable 5). As regards the entertainment behaviors, only gambling and looking at sexual \nNetiquette within Married Couples     21 \n \nmaterial showed significant gender differences, while for games and shopping wives and \nhusbands were equally concerned.  \nMonitoring \nThe previous sections discussed how both partners evaluated online activities undertaken \nby their partners. Since there was some disagreement about what was considered \nappropriate and since some online behavior of the partner was considered unacceptable it \nwould not be strange for partners to check up on each other\u2019s behavior. \n---Table 6 about here--- \nTable 6 shows that surveillance patterns in husbands and wives were significantly \nrelated (\u03c72(1)=132.85; p < .01; McNemar p < .01). Overall 73% of partners within a \ncouple had similar monitoring behavior (kappa=.37), in 56% of the couples none of the \npartners undertook any monitoring behavior and in 17% of the couples both partners used \nat least one of the six types of surveillance on their partner.  \nTable 7 examines the gender differences for the individual surveillance activities.  \nThis gives insight into which activities were most likely to be undertaken. \n---Table 7 about here--- \nTable 7 shows that husbands\u2019 and wives\u2019 monitoring activities were similar. The \nactivities that were most frequently undertaken were reading emails (10% of couples both \ndid this and in 22% couples one of the partners did this; \u03c72(1)=108.42; p < .01; McNemar \np < .01), reading SMS messages (10% of couples both did this and 20% one of the \npartners; \u03c72(1)=146.47; p < .01; McNemar p < .01), and checking the partner\u2019s browser \nhistory (4% of the couples both did this and in 16% one of them did ; \u03c72(1)=54.77; p < \nNetiquette within Married Couples     22 \n \n.01; McNemar p < .01). Kappa scores confirm that agreement between partners was \u2018fair\u2019 \nfor the surveillance behaviors. \nPercentage discrepancies in behavior between the two partners within the couple \nwere greatest for reading emails, reading SMS, and checking browser history, these were \nalso the three behaviors that were undertaken most frequently. Z-tests for two proportions \n(see Table 7) suggest that when only one person within the couple monitored their \npartner, it was significantly more likely to be the wife checking up on the husband than \nthe husband checking up on the wife.  \nDiscussion \nThe first aim of this paper was to understand whether partners in married couples \nshowed similarities in their idea of netiquette (i.e. similar social scripts as to what is \nacceptable internet behavior). This was measured through their views on time spent \nonline and through their evaluation of specific activities which might be considered \nproblematic as regards emotional or sexual infidelity and addiction. Research about \noffline attitudes, values and problematic behavior has shown that married partners tend to \nbe more similar to each other than to other people (Feng & Baker, 1994; Grant et al., \n2007; Low, Cui, & Merikangas, 2007; Luo & Klohnen, 2005; Mare & Schwartz, 2006; \nMurray et al., 2002; Sakai et al., 2004; White & Hatcher, 1984). This paper investigated \nwhether the same principle is valid for online behavior. We hypothesized that people with \nonline behavioral problems would be likely to marry people who perceive themselves to \nhave the same problems or for both partners to be without problems. The findings suggest \nthat there is no significant similarity between married partners as regards the time they \nNetiquette within Married Couples     23 \n \nspent online. Just over half of the partners within the married couples shared a similar \nevaluation of how much time they spent online.  \nAnother argument within the relationship literature is that marital satisfaction \ndepends not only on how similar the partners are but also on how good they are at \nevaluating their partner\u2019s behavior in a way that corresponds to that partner\u2019s self-\nevaluation (Acitelli, Kenner, & Weiner, 2001; Sillars et al., 1984). This type of \nagreement about the behavior of one partner was labeled congruence (as opposed to \nsimilarity) between the partners\u2019 evaluations. While there was no partner similarity in the \ntime each spent online, there was congruence between the partners in the evaluation of \nthe time one of the partners spend on the internet. \nIn H1 we predicted that partners within married couples share similar views about \nwhat types of behaviors are acceptable and unacceptable. The findings on time spent \nonline lead to the conclusion that H1 was supported, since the partners seem to have \ndeveloped similar ideas about how acceptable the online behavior of one of the partners \nwas. On the other hand, we would have to reject H1 if it is interpreted as two partners \nshowing similar behavioral patterns. There were many couples in which only one of the \npartners was perceived to have a problem with the time they spent on the internet.  \nThe second hypothesis (H2) stated that when couples did disagree women would \nbe more inclined to find online behaviors unacceptable than men. H2 was supported since \nwomen tended to evaluate the time that was spent online as more problematic than men. \nThus while there was high agreement about the extent to which the individuals within the \ncouple engaged with the Internet, when there was disagreement it was almost always the \nwomen who evaluated their own and their partner\u2019s behavior as more problematic.  The \nNetiquette within Married Couples     24 \n \nfact that it did not matter whether this disagreement was about the husband or the wife\u2019s \nbehavior suggests that women have a different interpretation of what constitutes \nexcessive internet use compared to men. The literature about risk perception and risk \ntaking might be of use in this context given that men have consistently been shown to \nhave lower perceptions of risk and are more prone to taking risks than women in similar \nsituations (Byrnes, Miller, & Schafer, 1999). Online there are examples of the same \neffect, for example, women perceive a higher level of risk in online purchasing compared \nwith men (Garbarino & Strahilevitz, 2004).Similarly, Youn (2005) and Strackstrud and \nLivingstone (forthcoming) showed that young women are more concerned about \nprotecting their online privacy than boys. This pattern is reflected in our findings in that \nmen were less likely to consider their own behavior and that of others problematic. Men \nwere indeed more likely than women to think online behaviors were acceptable which \ncould be considered an implicit endorsement of the activity.  \n Interesting results emerged when we examined which types of activities \nindividuals would feel happy or unhappy for their partner to engage in. Previous research \nfound that individuals typically regard online acts of infidelity as significant as offline \nacts of infidelity (Mileham, 2007; Parker & Wampler, 2003; Whitty 2003a, 2005; Whitty \n& Quigley, in press). Hence, it makes sense that in the majority of couples in our study \nboth partners said that they would be unhappy if their partner was engaging in such \nactivities online. Falling in love with someone online and engaging in cybersex with \nsomeone else topped the list of being unacceptable. It is important to point out that one of \nthe limitations of this study was that individuals (eg. men and women) might have \ninterpreted terms such as cybersex and hot chatting differently since participants were not \nNetiquette within Married Couples     25 \n \ngiven a definition or examples of these activities. So the findings should be qualified by \nstating that they hold for people\u2019s varying interpretations of infidelity and other \npotentially problematic behaviors. \nWe also investigated whether partners agreed on the acceptability of other \nbehaviors that have been considered addictive or involved financial risks. Online \ngambling was perceived by over half of all couples to be an activity they would be \nunhappy about their partner engaging in, whilst only 1% stated they would be happy \nabout their partner engaging in online gambling. The analyses showed that there is more \nevidence for a shared netiquette between partners as regards these entertainment \nbehaviors than for behaviors that were associated with infidelities. A tentative conclusion \nwould be that netiquettes about online entertainment behaviors are established within the \nintimate relationship while netiquettes about infidelity are based in broader societal \nnorms held in similar ways by everyone.  \nH1, which argued that partners develop similar ideas about netiquette, can thus be \nsupported for addictive or entertainment related activities, but should be rejected for most \nof the behaviors consisting of online infidelity.  \nIn our analysis we also compared whether the husband or wife were more likely \nto deem certain online activities more acceptable. We found that husbands were happier \nthan wives were for their partner to view \u2018adult\u2019 web sites (with sexual material). This \nmay be because women are far less likely to view online pornography compared to men \n(Dutton & Helsper 2007; Livingstone, Bober & Helsper, 2005; Weiser, 2000). Therefore, \nmen might be able to make the sure bet that their partner will not view pornography and \nso the potential for this to happen does not perturb them. In comparison, women might \nNetiquette within Married Couples     26 \n \ndeem it more likely that their partner will engage in this activity and thereby give it a \nmore severe rating. An alternative explanation may be that men approve of their partners \nviewing pornography more than women do because they see this differently. Other \nresearch also suggests that women are more likely to require mental exclusivity of their \npartner whereas men are less likely to require this type of fidelity of their partner \n(Cramer, Manning-Ryan, Johnson, & Barbo, 2000; Shackelford & Buss, 1996; Whitty, \n2003a; Whitty, 2005). Since this study did not examine offline sexuality and infidelity it \nis unclear if men are less accepting of non-Internet based infidelities than of the online \nequivalents. Future research should look at gender differences in evaluations of, for \nexample, both online and offline sexual encounters to understand whether gender \ndifferences vary according to the medium (e.g. face-to-face v. Internet) on which these \ntypes of undesirable behaviors take place. A third explanation is that in the evaluation of \nnetiquette related to online relationships and entertainment the same processes take place \nas for the evaluation of the time spent online. Women might consider a certain type of \nbehavior not only less acceptable in their husbands but also in themselves, thus \nevaluating an activity as problematic independent of which partner undertakes it. Of \ncourse, we cannot lose sight of the fact that in an overwhelming majority of couples both \npartners were unhappy about their partner engaging in this form of communication. \nNo matter what the explanation for these gender differences might be these \nfindings suggest that H2 was supported for netiquette as regards specific activities; when \npartners disagree about the acceptability of emotional and sexual infidelity or other \npotentially problematic online behaviors it tends to be the wife who is more concerned \nabout the behavior than the husband. This supports earlier research by Whitty (2003a) \nNetiquette within Married Couples     27 \n \nthat showed that women were more upset by online infidelity than men. Future research \nshould investigate how marital happiness relates to dissimilarities in partners\u2019 social \nscripts to understand whether or not the internet has come to play an important role in \nhow we experience intimate relationships. It seems women are not only more upset about \nthis behavior when they are the victims, but also feel more strongly that this type of \nbehavior is generally unacceptable.  \nAfter having established that most but not all partners within married couples \nshare the same netiquette about activities that might harm the relationship, the second aim \nof this paper was to understand whether partners developed similar patterns of \nsurveillance of each other\u2019s behaviors by using the internet to monitor what the partner is \ndoing online. The findings show that there are surprisingly high levels of surveillance but \nthat the types of surveillance used are quite limited. In around a third of the couples at \nleast one person checked their partner\u2019s emails or read their partner\u2019s SMS messages \nwithout them knowing and in a fifth of the couples at least one the partners had checked \ntheir spouse\u2019s browser history. While checking emails can be argued to have happened \naccidentally when the partner left their email open, two other frequently undertaken \nsurveillance behaviors are more clearly intentional. Reading SMS messages is a relatively \nheavy intrusion of privacy since a mobile phone which is usually carried on the person \nwill need to be taken from the partner for this type of monitoring to take place. The \nfindings did show that similarity in surveillance is quite high. In the majority of couples \nneither of the two partners monitored the other\u2019s behavior, but if one of the partners \nmonitored there was high chance that their partner was monitoring their behavior as well.  \nNetiquette within Married Couples     28 \n \nOur literature search suggests that research about similarity in surveillance \nbetween married partners is scarce. Therefore, we based H3 on the literature which \nargues for a high level of similarity in other positive and negative behaviors between \nmarried couples (Sakai et al., 2004; Shaw et al., 2007).  The findings showed that if one \nperson monitors their partners behavior it was highly likely that their partner also \nmonitored their behavior and if one partner did not monitor the others behavior it was \nlikely that this favour was returned, H3 was supported because partners did show similar \nsurveillance patterns.  \nWe further hypothesized that among couples where only one of the partners \nmonitored the other\u2019s behavior, the person monitoring was more likely to be the wife \nthan the husband. This hypothesis (H4) was based on the same premise as H2 which \nargued that women are in general more likely to be concerned about \u2018risky\u2019 or socially \nundesirable behavior. It was argued that due to this higher worry they were also more \nlikely to check up on their husbands. The findings show that wives were indeed more \nlikely to monitor their husband\u2019s behavior than that their husbands were to monitor their \nbehavior. This suggests that the focus on mate guarding should not be solely on men. \nMoreover, the provision of readily available electronic means of monitoring a partner\u2019s \nbehavior might have made it easier for women than it was in the past to monitor how \ntheir partner interacts with others. \nConclusions \nThis paper is one of the first to look at the importance of the internet in offline \nintimate relationships. We asked whether or not certain behaviors were considered taboo \nand it is clear that the fact that these behaviors take place in a virtual world does not make \nNetiquette within Married Couples     29 \n \nthem more acceptable within marriage. Overall partners seem to have similar ideas about \nwhich types of behaviors are unacceptable on the internet and disagreement can be \nexplained by women\u2019s higher levels of concern about their own and their partner\u2019s \nbehavior. Evidence was provided for both congruence and similarity between partners in \na couple, in future research it is important that this aspect is explored for a wider range of \nbehaviors and to understand whether this congruence is linked to marital satisfaction. The \noffline marital satisfaction literature suggests that greater congruence and similarity \nbetween partners leads to higher relationship satisfaction. It also suggests that married \ncouples showed higher levels of congruence and similarity than other unrelated \nindividuals. A replication of this study with people in different types of relationships \nwould give insight as to what extent the findings of this study can be replicated outside \nthe marital context. \nThe differences between men and women in terms of netiquette might be \nexplained by research that shows that men have more exposure to the contested behaviors \nand judge the likelihood that their wife undertakes these behaviors as less high, \nfamiliarity with and a lower judgement of the likelihood of a behavior in a partner might \nboth lead to lower levels of concern. Beyond the examination of gender differences, this \npaper did not delve deeper into what explained participants\u2019 concerns about their \npartner\u2019s behavior. We suggest that personal experience with different online behaviors \nmight soften or harden the stance of the person towards their partner undertaking this \nsame behavior. Similarly, to truly understand what leads people to monitor their partners \nbehavior it is important to research what people\u2019s estimate is of the likelihood that their \npartner will cheat on them.  \nNetiquette within Married Couples     30 \n \nFrom the findings presented in this paper it is clear that internet users do not shy \nfrom taking action when they think their partner might be undertaking activities that they \nare not comfortable with. The data used in this study does not allow for the conclusion \nthat all surveillance by partners is related to concerns about infidelity. Partners can check \nup on each other for a number of reasons (Whitty, 2003b; Whitty & Carr, 2006a) and the \nquestions did not delve deeper into these motivations. Whatever the reason for the \nmonitoring, partner surveillance was wider spread than the authors initially assumed, \nwith one out of every three couples having at least one partner who monitored the other \npartner\u2019s behavior using some kind of technological tool. It would be interesting to link \nmonitoring behavior to general marital happiness and to psychological characteristics \nsuch as neuroticism. One of the surprising findings was that spousal surveillance was \nundertaken more often by wives than husbands. This contrasts with general internet \nresearch that suggests that women are less technologically skilled than men (Durndell & \nHaag, 2002; Hargittai & Shafer, 2006). It seems that they are able to overcome these \nbarriers when they feel their relationship is at stake. This study did not find a type of \nsurveillance that was practiced more by men even though there is ample evidence for \nsuch behavior by men offline. \nThe internet will definitely continue to play a role in individuals\u2019 everyday lives \nand there is no doubt that how the use of this continually evolving technology impacts on \noffline relationships warrants further study. This study was one of the first to examine \nwhat couples expectations are about partners\u2019 online activities and how these correspond \nbetween the partners and was therefore exploratory in nature. The paper has raised many \nquestions that should be tackled in further research if we are truly to understand the role \nNetiquette within Married Couples     31 \n \nof the internet in intimate relationships. These studies should without doubt look at how \nother factors besides gender, such as length of marriage, social class and age of the \nmarried individuals, are related to netiquette in intimate relationships and perceptions of \nonline risks. Notwithstanding the relatively narrow scope of this paper, considering the \nextremely limited amount of work in this area, we believe that its contribution is an \nimportant one. We hope that it will serve as a starting point for other researchers to look \nat these and related issues in this often ignored but very important area of everyday life.  \nNetiquette within Married Couples     32 \n \nReferences \nAfifi, W.
