Introduction \n \nUpland landscapes have been the subject of policy debate for decades. In the UK, they \nare typically managed under livestock systems that would be commercially unviable \nwithout large government subsidies. However, these regions are highly valued for \nbiodiversity, carbon storage, water supply, physical beauty, game shooting and other \nrecreational opportunities [1]. Uplands around the world have experienced significant \nand often rapid socio-economic changes in recent years. In the EU in particular, \n                                                 \n* Email: m.reed@see.leeds.ac.uk \nPage 2 of 21\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 2\nuplands are facing an uncertain future due to new national, European and international \npolicy. For example, reforms to the European Union\u2019s Common Agricultural Policy \n(CAP) have \u2018decoupled\u2019 subsidies from agricultural production, and this has uncertain \nconsequences for farmers, other land managers, and the rural environment, the \ncharacter of which owes much to millennia of management. Changes in land use \npractices may also be required in many upland catchments if countries are to meet the \nrequirements of the EU Water Framework Directive and the Kyoto Protocol is a \npotential driver that has only recently been recognised as an opportunity by \npolicymakers and land managers.  The voluntary carbon offset market may provide \nadditional income where agricultural management increases carbon stored in soils [2]. \nIf further links between water discolouration (caused by dissolved organic carbon, \nDOC) and land management practices are shown, water companies may also require \nthose managing their land for grouse and sheep to make significant changes to their \npractices. In the UK, a number of conservation organisations are interested in \u201cre-\nwilding\u201d dry heath and blanket bog habitats that are currently managed for grouse and \nsheep. The ecological consequences of such a policy are unclear, especially under \nfuture climate change, and might possibly lead to scrub and forest ecosystems \nencroaching onto marginal blanket bog habitats. Natural England are increasingly \nrequiring managers of blanket bog Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) to reduce \nlevels of managed burning, and this adds further uncertainty for both the local ecology \n[3] and the livelihoods of those who generate income on blanket bog habitats. These \npolicies are being implemented in the context of ongoing socio-economic (e.g. \ndemographic) and environmental (e.g. climate) change.  In this context, decision-\nmakers from both policy and land management circles are keen to understand how \npotential future changes may affect them, and how they can best adapt to maintain \nupland goods and services.  \nAs we gaze into an uncertain future, traditional modelling approaches, which \nuse recent trends to make future predictions, are proving to be a poor basis for policy \n[4,5].  As a result, scenario studies are increasingly being used to help decision-\nmakers better understand, anticipate and respond to the sorts of dynamic and \nuncertain futures that uplands face. Although the number and sophistication of \nscenario-driven methods have increased substantially in recent years, there have been \nfew comparative analyses of outputs from such exercises. The British uplands offer a \nunique opportunity to do this, due to the significant number of scenario studies that \nhave been conducted for this system. Taken separately, these studies provide a \nfractured picture of what the future may hold for UK uplands. However, by drawing \ntogether the results from these studies, using a combination of literature review and \ninterviews with researchers involved in conducting the studies, this paper aims to \nprovide a more coherent picture of what the future might hold. To do this, the paper \naims to make an empirical and methodological contribution: i) the empirical \ncontribution is to draw together all the scenarios published to date for UK uplands, \nand evaluate which scenarios are perceived by stakeholders to be most likely and \ndesirable for this important socio-ecological region; and ii) the methodological \ncontribution is to assesses the benefits and drawbacks of the scenario methods used in \nthe UK uplands to date. \n \n \n2. Background: UK uplands past and present \n \nPage 3 of 21\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 3\nThe UK uplands have been grazed by livestock for thousands of years. Mesolithic \nhunter-gatherers contributed to woodland clearance in areas that were originally \nforested, to assist their foraging and stalking. In combination with pedogenesis and \nclimate change this assisted the spread of blanket peat [6]. Iron Age and Medieval \nfarmers continued to clear more of the remaining woodland, and the moorland edge \nadvanced and retreated in response to changes in demographic, climatic and \ncommercial pressures. Although the medieval wool industry was well-developed in \nmany upland areas, prior to the 19th Century, much hill-farming was less intensive and \ndid not take place year-round [7]. Economic and social incentives led in the 19th and \n20th century to growing flocks and in some places overgrazing by sheep, subsequently \ncombined with conflicting demands by grouse-moor owners, ramblers, and foresters. \nWhile in the second half of the twentieth century sheep numbers vastly increased, \nrising input costs and lack of skilled labour meant that some more extensive forms of \nmanagement, like shepherding, became less widespread. The character of the uplands \nhas thus been shaped by many centuries of management, many driven by subsistence \nand economic factors. Today, the latest changes to agricultural policy and the \nchanging way that uplands are perceived and valued, pose challenges for the future of \nthese landscapes.  \nThe tenor of agricultural policy in Britain over the last 60 years was firmly set \nby the 1947 Agricultural Act that aimed to meet the nation\u2019s need for indigenous food \nat reasonable prices with fair rewards to farmers and agricultural workers. This began \na period of agricultural enhancement promoted by guaranteed prices, farm capital \ngrants, publicly funded research and free advice to farmers. In 1973, when Britain \njoined the EU, the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) shared similar aims but had a \nsomewhat different funding mechanism. Both policy regimes included incentives for \nupland farmers to increase output by improved grassland management and increased \nstocking rates and animal liveweight. As a result, the Peak District alone saw a 275% \nincrease in sheep numbers between 1950 and 1976  and there was a further dramatic \nincrease in the 1980s [8]. High, guaranteed prices for lamb encouraged farmers to \ngraze more sheep on moorlands. Despite attempts to address market imbalances \nthough \u2018headage\u2019 quotas and payments for \u2018extensification\u2019 in the mid 1980s, major \nreform did not begin until the early 1990s. The most recent CAP reform began in \n2003. It seeks to remove production-based subsidies and replace them with decoupled \ndirect payments attached to cross-compliance with environmental and health \nstandards and \u201cGood Environmental and Agricultural Conditions\u201d [8,9]. In response, \nupland stocking rates decreased by 8% between 2004-2006 in the UK and there is \nnow a move towards less intensive sheep farming on moorlands coupled with more \nintensive farming in valley bottoms [8]. It is still unclear whether the CAP reforms \nand other schemes will encourage management that can deliver the desired \necosystems and economic goods and services. For example, in areas that have been \novergrazed for decades, habitat recovery may require more active interventions aimed \nat increasing inter alia pasture biodiversity than just a reduction in sheep numbers. \nUpland farmers can receive further payments through Less Favoured Area \n(LFA) (where proactive capacity is limited) and Environmentally Sensitive Area \n(ESA) schemes, designed to supplement upland farming incomes and maintain \ndistinct landscapes. Since 2001, farmers have received payments linked to good \nfarming practice rather than payments per head of livestock. ESAs aim to establish \nsustainable stocking rates in sensitive uplands. The scheme is voluntary and farmers \nare paid to reduce their stock to between 0.1-0.225 livestock units per hectare and \nremove 25% of their stock from the moors between October-February [10]. Although \nPage 4 of 21\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 4\nexisting ESA agreements are beginning to reach the end of their term, they have now \nbeen replaced by a two-tier \u201cEnvironmental Stewardship Scheme\u201d [8] where farmers \nreceive subsidy for developing and maintaining agro-environmental plans.   \nThese policies to protect and enhance upland ecosystems are important. \nUplands support a range of internationally rare species, including birds like dunlin \nand peregrine. Red grouse are economically important for game shooting and \nincreasingly important for conservation. The species was added to the UK \nBiodiversity Action Plan in 1997 because their populations had declined by more than \n25% in the last 25 years. Due to their biodiversity value, many uplands are protected \nunder national and international conservation law. In the UK, 16% of uplands are \ndesignated as SSSIs. In 2003, English Nature suggested that only 14% of moorland \nSSSIs in England were in favourable condition due to overgrazing and inappropriate \nburning [11], and management has therefore been prescribed to maintain or improve \ncurrent conditions.  \nA critical aspect of this debate is the role of rotational burning which is used \nby land managers to maintain mosaics of heather at different stages of maturity to \nprovide habitat for grouse, an important game bird. Although historically practiced \naround the world, this management practice is now unique to Britain and Ireland. \nRegulations regarding burning extend back to the medieval period, at least, with an \nAct of Scottish Parliament referring to \u201cmuirburn\u201d passed in 1400 [12]. Managed \nburning has continued to this day, with codes to control when and how moors can be \nburned (e.g. the Scottish Muirburn Code and the English Heather and Grass Burning \nCode and Regulations). Appropriate burning of heather moorland can protect against \nwildfire risk by reducing the quantity of combustible material while creating a \nmixture of habitats that improve biodiversity.  However, in some areas, long-term \ngrouse management may have converted blanket bogs into heather moorland and so \nreduced diversity of shrubs with a reduction in the moss and lichen layer [e.g. 13]. \nThe impact of grouse moor management on breeding moorland birds is unclear. \nWhilst heather burning and predator control are likely to benefit some species (e.g. \nGolden Plover favour short vegetation), others (e.g. species requiring tall heather and \nthe predators themselves) are likely to be disadvantaged. In reality, burning rotations \nand access limitations on most grouse moors mean there is a mosaic of areas burned \nat different times, and some areas are never burned, providing habitat for a range of \nspecies. Very little is known about the effects of burning on peat erosion, water \nquantity and quality [14]. However, recent data suggests that inappropriate burning \n(hot as opposed to cool fires) drives changes in vegetation patterns, and the vegetation \nthen has a strong influence on water quality, in particular water discolouration [15].  \nWater discolouration is a growing problem in the UK with some studies \nshowing a 65% increase in DOC over the last 12 years [16]. While water running off \npeat catchments containing drains is more discoloured than undrained catchments, the \nrelationship with other forms of land management remains unclear [14]. The Water \nFramework Directive, through the use of integrated River Basin Management Plans, \naims to protect and improve the environmental status of all river catchments in the \nEU, promote sustainable use, and reduce the effects of floods and droughts so that all \ncatchments achieve \u2018good status\u2019 by 2015 [17]. Challenges to achieving good status \ninclude effects of changing agricultural subsidies on land use, the uncertain impacts of \nclimate change and scientific uncertainly around what controls water discolouration in \nthe uplands and how it can be managed.  \nMany degraded upland peatlands currently lose more carbon than they absorb \nthrough gaseous and fluvial pathways. Peatlands represent one of the few long-term \nPage 5 of 21\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 5\nstores of carbon that can accumulate on the land surface through good management, \nso the identification and restoration of damaged peatlands to functioning ecosystems \ncould have significant beneficial impacts. Models suggest that across the UK as much \nas 400,000 tonnes of carbon a year could be stored in this way [18] or the equivalent \nof the carbon emissions of 2% of car traffic in England and Wales per year.  \nFinally, the importance of the tourism industry to the upland economy should \nnot be underestimated. In 2005 \u00a39.4 billion was spent on tourism and leisure services \nin England. During the Foot and Mouth crisis in 2001, when much of the uplands \nwere off limits, it is estimated that the tourism industry in the UK as a whole lost as \nmuch as \u00a38 billion and many businesses either closed or were severely scaled back as \na result [19]. \n \n \n3. Study Design \n \nWe undertook a review of academic and grey literature and identified eight studies \nthat had used scenarios to explore UK upland change [20]. It should be noted that the \nmajority of scenario studies that were identified refer to English and Welsh uplands, \nand there are quite different issues in different parts of the UK. For example, in \nScotland large areas of the uplands are managed for grouse and deer stalking with \nagriculture having relatively less importance compared with England. The identified \nstudies were systematically compared to elucidate methodological differences, and to \nsummarise differences in the content of the scenarios they developed. Where \nstakeholders were consulted, the scenarios that they deemed to be most and least \ndesirable were assessed. Alongside this analysis, nine semi-structured interviews were \nconducted to gain opinions on the use of scenarios and to better understand the \nscenarios used in each study. Interviewees were chosen on the basis of their \ninvolvement with the scenario studies and debates surrounding upland futures.  The \ninterviewees included academics, upland policy advisors from major NGOs and \ngovernment agencies, representatives from Department for Environment, Food and \nRural Affairs and the National Farming Union.  \nInterviews were transcribed and analysed using Grounded Theory Analysis. \nGrounded Theory is a qualitative method used to systematically analyse texts such as \ninterview transcripts to construct theoretical models [21]. This is performed by \nreading interview transcripts with specific questions in mind and coding passages \nwith keywords. By sorting quotes using keywords, it is possible to develop an \nunderstanding of how different respondents perceive the interaction of different \nphenomena. The whole process is carried out iteratively to ensure internal consistency \nwhich helps increase the outcomes\u2019 reliability and validity. Finally, the resulting \nmanuscript was sent to four stakeholders representing different interests in different \nparts of the country for pre-review and where relevant, co-authorship. \n \n \n4. Empirical contribution: the Future of the UK Uplands \n \nThe empirical contribution of this paper draws together and integrates the wide range \nof information currently available about possible futures for UK uplands. The \nfollowing section synthesises findings from each of the studies under headings that \nfollow the quadrants in Figure 1.  \nPage 6 of 21\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 6\nAn overview of each study is provided in Table 1. Table 2 lists the wide range \nof possible futures for UK uplands described in the eight studies, showing their \nrelative desirability according to the stakeholders who were consulted in each study \n(for information about methods used by studies to do this, see section 5). Despite \nfollowing very different approaches, the majority of scenarios developed in these \nstudies fall into four key groups (Figure 1). Figure 1 shows how the scenarios differ \nalong an environmental-economic continuum, depending on the level of support for a \npro-environment policy agenda, and varying levels of financial support for farmers. \nAlthough this summarises most scenarios well, it does not capture all the \nscenarios that were investigated. For example, study 5 considered changes in food \nmarkets and prices, as well as changes in yields under different scenarios. Study 8 \nconsidered scenarios based on drivers such as demographic change (leading to \nchanges in labour availability), climate change, and the effects of a grouse shooting \nban on upland management. This reflects the diverse range of concerns about the \nfuture that were expressed by stakeholders through semi-structured interviews during \nstudy 8. Such an approach may also capture \u201csurprise\u201d scenarios, which may help \nprepare stakeholders for, and increase resilience, to unexpected future events [33,34]. \nFor example, although not deemed very likely within the study period, stakeholders in \nstudy 8 suggested the expansion of arable land into uplands (due to global food \nshortages) as a surprise scenario that would have a significant impact.  \n \n[insert Figure 1 around here] \n[insert Tables 1 and 2 around here] \n \n \n4.1. Withdrawal of agricultural management and re-wilding \n \nAll the studies included a scenario where financial support was withdrawn from \nupland agriculture, leading to the withdrawal of agricultural management and\/or farm \ndiversification (the lower two quadrants in Figure 1). In both these scenarios, land is \nmost likely to be abandoned on the poorest, highest and most remote land. Without \nalternative support, re-wilding scenarios suggest that as the amount of land entered \ninto agri-environmental agreements declines, farms will go out of business and land \nwill be abandoned. It is anticipated that under this scenario, farmland may be replaced \nby conservation management and\/or reforestation through planting or natural \nregeneration.  \nIn studies 1, 2, 4, 6 and 7, where stakeholders were invited to express an \nopinion, the re-wilding scenario (without any alternative funding for conservation \nprogrammes) was deemed to be the least desirable future for UK uplands. Study 6 \ndescribed this scenario (which they called the \u201cliberalisation\u201d scenario) as \u201ca \nnightmare for biodiversity\u201d that would be hard to reverse, with negative impacts on \nbiodiversity, landscape amenity value and historic features for years to come. Study 5  \nhowever, identified environmental benefits arising from this scenario (which they \ncalled \u2018world markets\u2019) due to the release of land from farming in the lowlands and \nparticularly in the uplands. Using spatially differentiated modelled results, Study 5 \nidentified reductions in stocking rates, farm incomes and employment associated with \nagricultural abandonment in the uplands. Using the HillPlan model [35], they \npredicted that a reduction in grazing pressure under re-wilding might improve upland \nspecies composition in the short-term, leading to an increase in heath communities \nand reduction in bracken. In the long-term, however, other studies recognised that a \nPage 7 of 21\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 7\nsignificant reduction in grazing pressure may cause many heath communities to be \nreplaced by scrub and eventually be converted into forest. Given the international \nsignificance of these habitats for biodiversity, this was a major concern for most of \nthe stakeholders that were consulted in the studies. In addition, during the early \nphases of this change, ecosystems are likely to experience an increase in biomass and \nhence fuel-load, and this may increase accidental fires [36]. These may cause \nsignificant, sometimes long-term damage to upland soils and plant communities.  \nPerhaps due to the negative implications and the perceived political \nunacceptability of re-wilding for most stakeholders, it was believed to be the least \nlikely scenario to occur. However, this view was not shared by everyone. Sotherton et \nal. [1] explore the public spending priorities that upland farming will have to compete \nagainst in the future. They question whether future generations will concur with the \nstakeholders consulted in the studies reviewed in this paper, given ever-increasing \npressures on Government to raise budgets for health, education, pensions and security. \nAlthough the socio-economic effect of withdrawing financial support is relatively \nclear, the environmental implications are less clear-cut. Many conservationists favour \nre-wilding certain upland habitats, particularly blanket bogs [36], to maintain \nbiodiversity and encourage certain species (e.g. raptors). Although the cessation of \ngrazing and burning on dry heath would almost certainly increase scrub, leading to \neventual reforestation, the effects are less clear cut on blanket bog. Evidence about the \neffect of burning on blanket bog plant diversity is contradictory [3] and a combination \nof historic management and climate change may alter the future hydrology of blanket \nbogs, making them respond to changes in management in a similar way to dry heaths \n[36], with implications for carbon sequestration and water quality, for example. As \nsuch, there is an urgent need to understand the full implications of this scenario, so \nthat upland stakeholders can adequately prepare, and so that policy-makers can better \nevaluate the likely implications of different policy options. \nMost studies agreed that any process of re-wilding would most likely consist \nof some form of active conservation management (including the maintenance of fire \nbreaks) replacing sheep or grouse management, rather than land being completely \n\u201cabandoned\u201d, and that this would need to be facilitated through some kind of \nalternative funding.  Study 6\u2019s \u201cmanaged change for biodiversity\u201d scenario suggests \nthat change may be facilitated through funding equivalent to current levels, targeted at \nnature conservation in the form of \u201ccross-compliance\u201d where farmers would need to \nundertake conservation activities to continue to receiving government support [27].  \nStakeholders in Study 8 perceived that a ban on burning blanket bog habitats, \nand hence withdrawal of active management from more limited areas, was more \nprobable than the kind of broad scale re-wilding described above. Such a policy \nwould address many of the concerns and priorities of conservationists, and matches \nthe kind of tighter regulation that Natural England lobbied for during Defra\u2019s 2007 \nreview of the Heather & Grass Burning Code. \n \n \n4.2. Significantly reduced levels of hill farming supported by diversification \n \nIn the studies, re-wilding scenarios were often coupled with income diversification \n(though they were sometimes presented separately; bottom-right quadrant in Figure \n1).  Under the reduced hill farming scenario, it is assumed that there would be support \nfrom a range of alternative enterprises including off-farm income. New sources of \nincome could include, for example: tourism, recreation and leisure activities (e.g. Bed \nPage 8 of 21\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 8\nand Breakfast establishments); direct marketing and processing of local produce (e.g. \n\u201cfell-bred\u201d lamb); alternative crops or other products (e.g. planting bioenergy crops in \nupland valleys); and new business ventures (e.g. wind farms). The associated fall in \nthe demand for agricultural inputs and services such as feed, fertilizers, vets and \nauction marts, would be offset to some extent by demands for alternative inputs and \nservices associated with new enterprises and land uses under this scenario. Studies \ndiffer over the extent to which support from diversification would lead to a reduction \nin the number of farms and livestock in UK uplands. Where this leads to \nabandonment of land for agricultural purposes, natural regeneration to scrub and \nforests, and management for nature conservation would be anticipated. \n Although varying levels of diversification entered many of the scenarios \ndeveloped by the studies reviewed here, only study 4 developed a scenario focussed \nspecifically on the effects of diversification. Compared to the other scenarios \nevaluated in study 4, the diversification scenario was deemed to be most desirable, but \non the assumption that it would lead to a lower impact on farm and livestock numbers \nthan \u201creduced levels of hill farming based on cross-compliance with environmental \nmeasures\u201d (section 4.4). The \u201clocal stewardship\u201d scenario developed by study 5 \nincluded significant diversification, with agricultural support reflecting local needs, \nself-reliance and local social and environmental objectives. This goes beyond the \ndiversification scenario of study 4 to suggest greater contact between consumers and \nproducers through local markets and brands, and farmer co-operatives and marketing \nschemes designed to add value and raise prices. This could, however, mean that due \nto relatively low yields, the agricultural area could increase, with the dominance of \nextensive systems on mainly family farms. Although desirable from a social \nperspective, potential environmental benefits could be compromised by the relatively \nhigh occupancy of land, and significant increases in stocking rates in the uplands. \n Many farming households already have more than one source of income.  A \nstudy conducted by the [37] found that in the 1990s nearly 60% of farming \nhouseholds were engaged in additional activities outside conventional farming, such \nas speciality crops, accommodation, recreation and leisure.  However, diversification \nwas found to be less likely on smaller farms and less likely in uplands.  For upland \nfarmers a remote location will restrict their ability to exploit opportunities in the \ntourism and leisure sectors.  At the same time in the last ten years the demand for \nleisure in the countryside has fallen [19].  The danger is that encouraging more \nfarmers to diversify into the tourism industry may not be sustainable if they are \ncompeting for a decreasing number of visitors.  Location may also limit the ability of \nfarmers to take advantage of the growing biofuels industry.  Poor soils, high rainfall \nand difficult access mean that most upland farms, particularly those inside LFAs, are \nunsuitable for biofuels at the present time.  Marketing local produce may provide the \nbest opportunity for upland farmers to increase the value of their products.  Currently \nthe market is small and although there is strong interest it has not yet been translated \ninto a change in buying habits for most people.  It requires strong, dynamic and \ncommitted farmers to make it a success but there is strong evidence of a positive \nimpact for small producers [38]. \n \n \n4.3. Continued levels of hill farming supported by pre-reform Common Agricultural \nPolicy style subsidies \n \nPage 9 of 21\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 9\nAlthough deemed unlikely given current policy trajectories, this scenario assumes that \nit would be possible to halt (and possibly reverse in some areas) the existing trend \ntowards declining upland farms, livestock and labour availability. It assumes that the \narea of land used for hill farming and entered into agri-environmental agreements will \nremain largely unchanged from current levels, with minimal shifts towards alternative \nland uses such as forestry. Diversification into tourism and recreation would continue \nat current levels, with limited levels of direct marketing and processing, and the \nmajority of farm incomes would come from agricultural production. There would be \nlimited controls on agro-chemicals and farming practices on environmental grounds. \nThere would be a focus on commercial outputs and production with relatively \nintensive farming to provide self-sufficiency.  \nAs the scenario that most closely represents past and current conditions (as \nopposed to what is deemed most likely to happen \u2013 see section 4.4), it seems likely \nthat this should have been one of the most preferred scenarios. There is a well \ndeveloped literature about \u201cstatus-quo bias\u201d that explores why most people prefer the \nstatus-quo to change [39]. Various arguments are proposed, including people\u2019s natural \naversion to risk and the unknown.  However, this bias cannot be assumed: Study 5 \nranked this protectionist oriented scenario high in terms of production and social \nbenefits, but relatively low on economic and environmental performance. This \nscenario required continuation of \u2018deficiency\u2019 payments in order to compensate \nfarmers for low market prices. However, in the last year world prices for rice and \nwheat have seen sharp increases and there are many in the agricultural sector who \nbelieve that this may be a precursor for increasing prices across the board, including \nlivestock, and a return to more intensive agriculture.  In a situation where livestock \nprices reflect the costs of inputs and give farmers better profit margins then such a \n\u201cstatus-quo\u201d scenario may well be preferred. \n \n \n4.4. Reduced levels of hill farming based on cross-compliance with environmental \nmeasures \n \nMost of the stakeholders who were consulted believed that government financial \nsupport would continue in some form for upland farming in the future. Given the \ngrowing prominence of environmental concerns in policy-making, a scenario where \nreduced levels of hill farming based on cross-compliance with environmental \nmeasures was deemed by stakeholders to be the most likely to occur (top left quadrant \nin Figure 1). Despite a reduction in hill farm production, this scenario would \ncontribute to local, regional and global ecosystem goods and services, including a \ncomprehensive approach to the minimisation of diffuse pollution from agriculture and \nan emphasis on the multi-functionality of upland landscapes. However, there could be \nsignificantly fewer farms. Although there would be some amalgamation into larger \nfarms, a limited number of family farms would remain viable. It is also assumed that \nlarge tracts of land (concentrated in the highest and most remote areas) could cease to \nbe grazed or managed in any way for agriculture, where some afforestation and \nmanagement for nature conservation may occur. The demand for agricultural inputs \nand services would decline, offset to an extent by demand for new goods and services \nto support diversification.  \n Most of the projects reviewed here also agreed that some level of continued \npublic support for hill farming would be the most desirable future scenario. Study 2 \ncame to this conclusion on the basis of environmental criteria alone. However, other \nPage 10 of 21\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 10\nstudies came to the same conclusion using broader criteria. For example, the \u201cglobal \nsustainability\u201d scenario in study 5 scored highest on environmental, social and \neconomic criteria on the basis of simulation model outputs. Initially developed by the \nUK Foresight programme [40,41], this scenario consisted of a low intervention, \nmarket-oriented regime, with targeted sustainability \u201ccompliance\u201d requirements and \nprogrammes. Critically, this scenario, which included bio-energy cropping, involved \nhigh occupancy of lowland areas such that the demand for upland livestock \nproduction remains relatively strong. Similarly, study 7 found that members of the \npublic in the Southern Uplands were most willing to pay for landscapes where \n\u201cEnvironmentally Sensitive Area\u201d schemes had significantly reduced grazing levels. \nLike many of the scenarios in this group, these scenarios broadly match the emerging \nfunding regime under CAP reform, with the Single Farm Payment requiring hill \nfarmers to comply with various environmental and other standards and opportunities \nfor additional funding linked to environmental work through the Stewardship scheme. \nOn the other hand, study 6 estimated that this scenario (their business as usual \nscenario, assuming continuing trends) was significantly more expensive than the \ncomplete withdrawal of government support for upland agriculture. They also \nconcluded that this scenario would provide fewer biodiversity benefits than re-\nwilding, whether re-wilding was supported financially through cross-compliance \n(their \u201cmanaged change for biodiversity\u201d scenario) or not (their \u201cliberalisation\u201d \nscenario). \n \n \n5. Methodological contribution: comparative analysis of scenario methods  \n \nThe significant number of scenario studies conducted to date in UK uplands, each \nusing different methods, provides an opportunity for comparative analysis in this final \nsection of the paper. It starts by comparing the temporal, geographical and thematic \nscope of the scenarios developed. It then covers methods: comparing methods for \nidentifying stakeholders; the extent to which stakeholders were engaged at different \nstages of scenario development; and methods to visualise, explore and elaborate \nscenarios in more depth. It concludes by discussing the limitations of the methods \nused, and makes recommendations for future scenario development for uplands. \nThe time horizons covered by these projects ranged from less than 10 years \ninto the future in study 1, up to 2050 in study 5. Although all focussed on UK \nuplands, some were restricted in their geographical scope (e.g. to England or \nCumbria) and in the issues or stakeholders they targeted.  \nTable 3 shows the range of different methods that were used to create the \nscenarios and assess their implications in these studies. Choice of stakeholders may \naffect the outcome of scenario studies, especially when involved in both scenario \ndevelopment and evaluation. Although all the studies reviewed here identified \nfarmers, other upland stakeholders appeared to be selected on a more ad-hoc basis by \nmost research teams (only studies 6 and 8 identified stakeholders systematically while \nother studies did not always specify the stakeholders involved in the study). No \nindividual study identified all the categories of upland stakeholder that had been \nidentified between the studies. However, studies 1 and 8 identified most categories (7 \nand 8 respectively compared to an average of 4.5), including water companies, grouse \nmoor managers and forestry. These may represent significant omissions from the \nother six studies, given the significant economic role of uplands as the main source of \npotable water for the UK, the role of grouse moor management in maintaining heather \nPage 11 of 21\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 11\nmoorland in many uplands, and the significance of forest cover in other uplands. \nAlthough many of the interviewees suggested that members of the general public \nshould be involved in scenario evaluation, very few of the studies actually involved \nrepresentatives from the general public. One of the problems of involving \nstakeholders in evaluating scenarios was illustrated by Study 7, where respondents \ndisplayed a preference for the status-quo over scenarios that involved change [c.f. 39]. \nIt may also be questioned whether participants always possess sufficient knowledge to \npredict environmental and ecological changes in this complex system, hence a \nrequirement for a varied range of perspectives and expertise in the planning of \nscenario approaches. \n \n[insert Table 3 around here] \n \nStakeholder engagement in the scenario studies reviewed here typically took \nplace during scenario development but was also used to evaluate scenarios in some \nstudies (Table 3). The depth of consultation varied from a single workshop (e.g. \nstudies 3 and 5) to a combination of workshops and in-depth interviews (e.g. study 8). \nThe most participatory approach was followed by study 8, where scenarios were \ndeveloped from a combination of grounded theory analysis of interview transcripts \nand literature review, which they then evaluated in workshops with stakeholders. \nEach workshop followed a three-step process: i) evaluating the likelihood and impact \nof individual scenario components; ii) evaluating the likelihood and impact of full \nscenarios (consisting of the components evaluated in the previous step); and iii) \ndiscussion of possible other scenarios not considered. \nA range of techniques was used to explore and elaborate scenarios in greater \ndepth. Economic valuation was used by studies 2 and 7 to develop scenarios with \ngreater emphasis on economic impacts. Study 8 went a step further by considering a \nrange of non-economic indicators using an Agent-Based Model to simulate how land \nmanagers are likely to respond to different scenarios. Such models represent human \ndecision making by deriving \u201crules of behaviour\u201d from the actual experiences, \nopinions and perceptions of land managers (\u201csocial agents\u201d) through interviews. By \nexamining the knock-on effects of likely land manager behaviour on the environment, \nit should be possible to provide more realistic computational simulations of different \nscenarios. Study 8 was also the only study that integrated simulation models with \nstakeholder participation [30].  \nVisualisation techniques are sometimes used to communicate scenarios to \nstakeholders. For example, digitally manipulated photographs were used in study 7 to \ncommunicate the effects of varying subsidy levels on ecological succession and \nbiodiversity. However, visualisation techniques pose the risk of visual bias. Aspects \nof scenarios that can easily be represented visually (e.g. land cover change) may \nreceive more attention from focus group participants than other aspects (such as \ncultural or demographic change).  \nThe limitations of scenario studies are well documented [e.g. 42,43,44] and \nwere emphasised by those interviewed for this research. For example, there is a \ndanger that decisions may be biased by scenarios that lack a sufficient evidence base, \ndownplay uncertainty, or that do not consider sufficiently different time-horizons or \nperspectives. Scenarios may lack transparency if they do not make their assumptions \nexplicit. For example, respondents may fail to differentiate between different upland \nhabitats and regions, assuming that a scenario may have similar effects across both. It \nmay also be difficult to effectively communicate the levels of uncertainty associated \nPage 12 of 21\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 12\nwith different scenarios, for example due to their dependence on links with external \nsystems e.g. global food markets. The choice of criteria against which scenarios are \nevaluated may also bias the outcome, although there was no evidence that this \noccurred in the studies reviewed above, since those using environmental criteria alone \nfavoured similar scenarios to those using environmental, social and economic criteria.  \nAlthough it is difficult to generalise from so few studies, more in-depth \nparticipation from stakeholders appeared to broaden the scope of the scenarios \ndeveloped. However, without systematic and representative stakeholder selection, \nthere is a danger that participation may bias results [29]. Skilled facilitation is also \nnecessary to ensure stakeholders with vested interests do not bias outcomes, and to \nensure balanced representation of views from all interested parties. Although \ncomputational simulation models can enhance detail and add a predictive component \nto scenario development, there is a danger that these are seen as a \u201cblack box\u201d by \nstakeholders, reducing scenario credibility [45]. Even with involvement from \nstakeholders during model development (e.g. Study 8) computational models to some \nextent always remain a black box as the internal logic, assumptions and shortcomings \nare only known to the modeller [30]. Land managers who have developed a good \nunderstanding of their actions and consequences are asked to believe that the model \nrepresents their \u2018stylized actions\u2019 \u2013 which requires a considerable amount of trust on \nthe part of stakeholders. To involve stakeholders in the model development process, \nreferred to as mediated modelling, might help to reduce this problem [30]. \n \n \n6. Conclusion \n \nUplands around the world are facing significant socio-economic and environmental \nchange and decision-makers need to better understand what the future may hold if \nthey are to adapt and maintain upland goods and services. Although the impacts of \nsuch exercises on policy are notoriously hard to quantify [46], scenario exercises of \nthe sort explored in this paper offer upland managers, policy-makers and stakeholders \na useful tool to evaluate future practice and policy options in order to prepare for \ndifferent futures. While the case studies reviewed in this paper mainly focus on UK \nuplands, scenario development has the potential to inform policy and strategy in \nuplands throughout the EU [27].  \nOn the basis of the methods comparison in this paper, it would appear that \nupland futures research could better integrate in-depth participation from stakeholders \nduring both scenario development and evaluation in order to explore the range of \nfutures that really concern the people who live and work in these environments and \nthose that enjoy their leisure time in the uplands. In doing so, systematic and \nrepresentative stakeholder selection is essential to avoid biasing results. To date, few \nstudies have used visualisation techniques in uplands, but these methods must be used \nwith care to avoid visually biasing results.  \nAlthough it is difficult to directly compare the scenarios from the studies \nreviewed here, we can extract a number of common threads that stakeholders were \nparticularly concerned about. Figure 1 depicts the main drivers, on two axes, that \nshow how most of the scenarios fall into four key groups. Stakeholders agreed that the \nmost desirable and likely scenario would be a continuation of hill farming, albeit at \nreduced levels, based on compliance with environmental measures. The least \ndesirable scenario was a complete withdrawal of government financial support for hill \nfarming. Although this was deemed by stakeholders to be the least likely scenario, it \nPage 13 of 21\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 13\nwarrants close attention due to the significance of its implications. There is an urgent \nneed to understand the full implications of this scenario, so that upland stakeholders \ncan adequately prepare, and so that policy-makers can better evaluate the likely \nimplications of different policy options. This will require further interdisciplinary \nresearch and collaboration between researchers and stakeholders.  \n \nAcknowledgements \nWe are indebted to the interviewees who gave their time to discuss this research.
