This paper proposes that computer conferencing systems\nshould be designed to encourage students to participate in three dimensions previously treated by\nseparate researchers. These can be summarized as a knowledge dimension, a social dimension and a\nmotivational dimension. This paper reports on how one particular conference, that of M205-STILE, was\nconstructed to take account of these dimensions and to facilitate students' computer-supported co-\noperative learning.\nIntroduction\nTeaching projects which make use of new technology are becoming of interest to all academic\ninstitutions in the UK due to economic pressure to increase student numbers. CMC (Computer-\nMediated Communication) such as computer conferencing appears an attractive solution to\nhigher education's 'numbers' problem, with the added benefit that it is free from time and\nplace constraints. Researchers have discussed CMC from a number of different perspectives,\nfor example Mason and Kaye (1989) describe a CMC system as a system of interactivity\nbetween tutors, students, resources and organizational structure. Steeples et al (1993) consider\nCMC in terms of group cohesion, modes of discourse and intervention strategies to stimulate\nand structure participation. Goodyear et al (1994) discuss the Just in Time (TT-Based) Open\nLearning (JTTOL) model in terms of a set of educational beliefs, role definitions, working\nmethods and learning resources, together with a definition of infrastructure requirements for\nCMC. Shedletsky (1993) suggests that a CMC should be viewed in terms of an 'intrapersonal\ncommunication' model, while Mayes et al (1994) identify three types of learning which is\nmediated by telematics, that is, learning by conceptualization, construction and dialogue. Other\nresearchers, such as Velayo (1994), describe the teacher as 'an active agent', and present a\nmodel for computer conferencing which neglects the social aspect of CMC, while Berge\n(1995) mentions the importance of social activity between students and the importance of the\n58\nALT-J Volume 4 Number I\nrole of the moderator. From these accounts, there appear to be a number of dimensions which\ncan be used to evaluate CMC. Not all researchers emphasize the same dimensions; however,\nthis paper proposes that computer conferencing systems should be designed to encourage\nstudents to participate in all three of the following dimensions. These can be summarized as:\n(a) a knowledge dimension (includes domain and meta knowledge);\n(b) a social dimension; and\n(c) a motivational dimension.\nWe will focus on the design and management of a conference M205-STILE, which was\nemployed by the Open University's Computer Science department to supplement the teaching\nof an undergraduate course. The conference was structured into sub-conferences to take\naccount of the above three dimensions and to facilitate students' computer-supported\ncollaborative learning. This paper reports on the construction of the CMC environment, but\nmore importantly how the three dimensions can be sustained through the role of a person\nwhom we have called an Interactive Media Facilitator (IMF). This implementation is part of\nthe 'Students' and Teachers' Integrated Learning Environment' (STILE) project.\nThe STILE project\nThe STILE project started at the Open University at the end of March 1994, and set out to pilot\nthe use of conferencing facilities on M205, the Fundamentals of Computing course. The main\naim of the project was to improve the presentation of the course by offering online facilities to\na group of 110 students taking the course in 1995 (February to November). M205 usually has a\nstudent population of over 3,000, and is presented to the Open University's distance learners as\ntext and video material. For the students taking part in the project, the extra commitment was\nto use the online facilities for 'tutorial-type support', to access extra course materials, and to\ninteract with their tutor and fellow students. The students who took part were selected from\nvolunteers who were interested in participating, had suitable equipment, for example a 386 PC\nto a particular specification, a telephone line, and were prepared to pay their own telephone\nbill. For further information on the selection of tutors and students see Wilson (1995).\nThe M205-STILE computer conference\nOver 100 students used Softarc's FirstClass conferencing system to engage with their fellow\nstudents and tutors. Sub-conferences were set up at various levels within M205-STILE where\nthe students could socialize, work in tutorial groups, consult with the course team, and access\nextra course material (see Figure 1). It is even at a first glance obvious to see how the social\nand knowledge dimensions of the conference have been catered for. The Tutorial conferences\nand the Help conference provide the knowledge dimensions, while the general Meeting Area\nand the Student Only area provide the social dimension. This paper concentrates on the Help\nand Meeting Place conferences. We anticipated that the motivational aspects of the\nconferencing system would become evident through the changing nature of the conference\nitself, and that the introduction of an independent IMF would have a significant contribution\nto the motivational aspects of the conferences overall.\n59\nTina Wilson and Den\/se Whitelock Making use of technology to present a distance learning computer science course\n\u2022\nmaterials notices\nmessages\nThe desktop\nmailbox\nD-D\nmisc confs\nr\nM205 - STILE\nO\n - FT\nresource meeting area \" e l P\ndevelopment D\ntutorials course material\nmessages\nnpn.,n\non-line material\n| messages\nfigure \/; Conference structure for M205-STILE\nThe role of the Interactive Media Facilitator\nIn order to create a learning environment for the students without overloading the tutors, it was\nimportant to consider how to minimize the perceived workload. Goodyear et al (1991) found\nthat tutoring via email worked well but that the 'quality and quantity of interactions on matters\nof course content' did not meet initial expectations. To ensure a work focus, the overall control\nand responsibility for all conferences within M205-STILE was allocated to an independent\ncontroller, the IMF. With this strategy, the tutors were left free to engage in the tutorial\nconferences and to dip into the other conferences as they wished. In order to reduce tutor-\noverload associated with reading social-type messages, the work-related dialogue was\nseparated from chat, not only by creating separate conferences but also giving the\nresponsibility of the chat conferences to the IMF.\nThere is always a need for a moderator in conferencing to stimulate conversation and watch\nout for trouble, etc. Berge (1995) describes the role of the moderator in computer conferencing\nas involving 'special technical and educational responsibilities and powers'. The role of the\nIMF however is different. The IMF is responsible for\n(a) constructing the environment;\n(b) acting as a facilitator and motivator; and\n(c) encouraging tutors and students to utilize the medium in order to take full responsibility\n60\nALT-J Volume 4 Number I\nfor their teaching and learning. In the future the IMF's role will develop across different\ntypes of media, but in this specific implementation, the IMF facilitated distance learning\nstudents' use of conferencing and the World Wide Web. The IMF, in this instance and\nin the future, did and would develop teaching materials to guide the students in their use\nof new technology, in this case to bring them online. The IMF was the overall controller\nor administrator for all conferences (including social conferences), and guided the tutors\nand students in how to use the system for teaching and learning. Tutors and students\nhave varying levels of experience in, and abilities at, mastering new technology, and the\nIMF needed to encourage the learner not to be frightened of the technology. This was\nachieved partly by monitoring and encouraging activity in all conferences relevant to the\ncourse, directing the students to the different conferences at the right time, setting up\nnew conferences and access permission as required.\nThe IMF looked out for developing needs for conferences, sent encouraging personal messages\nto the students and tutors, and kept a watchful overview to spot problems before they arose.\nThe IMF was centrally based and the lynch pin (contact person) for students and tutors alike to\ncontact when they first came onto the system and in cases of problems throughout the year. We\nwould recommend that in the future the IMF might be seen as part of the course team (that is,\npart of the group of people putting together the distance-learning course), taking overall\nresponsibility for the online side of course production, that is, preparing relevant\ndocumentation to enable the students to access the facilities, and then following the role\nthrough to creating the environment and facilitating the tutor and student participation. In this\nway, the IMF would be aware of the learning aims of the course, while supplying expertise in\nhow the technology could be used to meet objectives in both the design and presentation of the\ncourse. The use of new technology would therefore be integral to the course and not just a bolt-\non after-thought. The IMF could take control of a number of courses, but work overload must\nbe avoided if the IMF is to fulfil all his or her duties.\nSTILE participants\nOf the 110 students taking part, 24 were female and 86 were male. Of the 24 female students,\nnine had used a modem before, and IS had not. Six of the female students had used\nconferencing software, and one had used Internet mail. Of the 86 male students, 50 had\nexperience of using a modem, and 36 did not. Sixteen of the male students had experience of\nusing conferencing software, and 15 had experience of sending Internet mail. The gender of\nthe nine tutors taking part in M205-STILE was six males to three females. One of the tutors\nhad previous experience in conferencing. Two had experience of using modems. Six had\nvarying experience in using email. All used computers as part of tutoring M205, and all used\ncomputers for their occupation.\nPreliminary findings\nThe presentation of the course runs from February through to October, and requires the\nstudents to submit eight tutor-marked assignments and to sit an examination at the end of the\ncourse. To gauge what type of activity the students were involved in and how it changed, we\nhave analysed the number and type of messages in two sub-conferences, which were the\nMeeting Place, a social conference, and M205-Help, a work-focused conference.

These two conferences were compared\nsince there was no restriction on who could access either conference.\nSocial aspects\nThe social dimension of the conference was apparent from the beginning, since we found that\nstudents tried to get to know the system, and in so doing started to learn about each other. The\nfirst month was a critical period for social activity before the focus on course-content became\nmore important. Looking at the social conference, that is the Meeting Place, the majority of\nstudent messages are for fellow students. Not much talk is directed to their tutor. Student\nmessages to their fellow students accounted for 47.6% of messages, while student messages to\ntutors only accounted for 5.6%. There is very little talk about general computing, problem-\nsolving or about help with the system itself; in fact, as one would expect, most of the messages\nwere of the 'getting to know you' type (see Figure 2).\nThe pattern of student interaction from February to August in the Meeting Place is shown in\n62\nALT-] Volume 4 Number I\nFigure 3. More messages were recorded in February, while there was only one in August This\nsuggests that in the first month the students were using the system from the earliest opportunity\nto make contact with each other and their tutor. There was no need to talk about work at this\nstage, and we found that students discussed work-related issues later in the course (see below,\n'Knowledge dimension').\nStudents introduced themselves to each other in a number of different ways, but a typical early\nsocial message is illustrated by the following example.\n8 Feb\nHello everyone,\nI have been having fun working my way around the icons!\nI'm from Barry so perhaps I'm within yelling distance ofMerthyr!!\nAnyone else in the S. Wales area about?\nGood luck everyone. Happy clicking!\nKnowledge dimension\nThe M205-Help conference was ah area set aside specifically for daily help with solving\ncomputing problems. Members of the course team who originally wrote the course material\nwere available here to answer queries. The tutors were also invited to 'chip in' if they could.\nThe majority of messages in this area were student-to-student interaction. Very little talk was\ndirected to the course team or tutor (see Figure 4). A message-approval feature was available\nwith the software but was not adopted in either this conference or the Meeting Place\nconference. This meant that whatever message a student put up, the other students could see it\nimmediately and respond without waiting for the course team to reply. Whether the message-\napproval feature was used or not could have a great bearing on the flow of messages. Some\nstudents have reported frustration with other conferences when new messages were posted but\nnot readable because they had not been approved.\nOf the total number of messages in this conference, 69% were generated by the students\nthemselves. Again the majority of student messages were for their fellow students, rather than\nthe tutors. Student messages to their fellow students accounted for 56.8% of messages, while\nstudent messages to tutors only accounted for 7.2%. When the message content was analysed\n(see Figure 4), there were more messages of a problem-solving nature than about using the\nsystem, etc. The M205-Help conference had been designed as a problem-solving area. The\nIMF sent messages to encourage the students to use this conference to ask the course team and\ntheir fellow students for help.\nWhen the messages from the M205-Help conference were analyzed over time (February to\nAugust - see Figure 5), very few messages were found for the month of February. Our data\nindicates that there was more activity in The Meeting Place during this first month (see below,\n'Social aspects'). Since the messages there were more like introductions, we would suggest\nthat the students at this time were busy getting to know each other and the system rather than\nsolving computing problems. The number of messages, however, increased in the M205-Help\nconference for the month of March, and remained steady through April, May and June. In July,\nthe number of messages increased, and this could be explained by the fact that the students\nneeded to submit a tutor-marked assignment by 1 August. Upon closer inspection of the nature\n63\nTina Wilson and Denise Wn'itelock Making use of technology to present a distance learning computer science course\n(0\nCD\na?\n(0\nCD\nE\n\"c\nCD\n\" D\nTo\nt ^\no\nt _\nCD\nX3uu\n3\nZ\n60 -I\n50 \u2022\n40 \u2022\n30 -\n20 -\n10 -\n0 -\nmj | |\nSo\nci\nI1\u2022\nCO\nCD\na i\ne\nss\na\nGe\nne\nra\nl\nco\nm\npu\ntin\ng E n>\nS o(1 \u00ab II Il|3**l\nHe\nl\nth\ne\nSubject matter in 'M205 - Help'\nFigure 4: Type of messages found in M205-Help\nFigure 5: Number of student messages posted to M205-Help per month\nof the message content, students were asking each other for help with respect to these\nassignments.\nThe majority of messages in the M205-Help conference were related to students aiding each\nother with specific problems which could be conceptualized, as shown in the first message\nbelow, or as technical problems - see message of 9 April.\n64\nALT-J Volume 4 Number I\n8 April\nHiAndie\nfrom your reply you still seem a bit confused about how to use the two arrays 'previous'\nand 'newreadings'.

The students were\ninstructed to direct their subject specific issues to their own tutor's tutorial conference or to the\nM205-Help conference. In the latter, they could expect help from their fellow students and\nthree members of the course team. However, we have found that the IMF has been asked about\nspecific help with programming difficulties as well as technical problems with operating the\nCMC. A further role also emerged, that of counsellor. As a case in point, the IMF was asked\nabout his competence as a Pascal programmer, and in the ensuing conversation it became\nevident that the student was struggling on from one tutor-marked assignment to the next,\ncontinually reflecting on 'should he stay on the course'. In fact, this student and others have\nstated that they would have abandoned the course if M205-STTLE was not providing support\nfor their study. With M205-STTLE, they felt they could see whether other students were\nexperiencing the same difficulties as themselves. One such student has developed a learning\nstrategy whereby he follows the questions asked by another student who orchestrated the\ndifficulties. In effect, he was shadowing the other student and relying on the latter to obtain\nessential information for his own understanding. The students also expressed their belief in the\nconferencing system to provide pertinent help, and hence sustain their motivation and interest:\n13 Feb\nHi George,\nFrom the Aberdeen area. I'm looking forward to the course and am all in favour of this type\nof contact with other students and the tutor. Hopefully I will not need to use this method of\ncommunication with you too often (wishful thinking i.e. the course is easy) but if I do then\nI'm sure that I can say what I'm stuck with more clearly via e-mail than over the telephone.\nAnd I won't hesitate to use this method.\nAt the beginning of the course, all of the students were sent a questionnaire about how\ninterested they were in using M205-STTLE to help their study. A response rate of 50% was\nobtained, and the majority of students who replied felt motivated to use the system to aid their\nunderstanding of the computing subject matter (see Figure 6).\n_\nTina Wilson and Denise Whitelock Making use of technology to present a distance learning computer science course\nScale of 1 to 5. 5= very interested\nFigure 6: Students' interest in using the system at the beginning of the project\nSummary of findings\nOur preliminary findings suggest that the conferences were being used to explore course-\ncontent, although some social 'chit-chat' still took place. Many students have been looking on\nfrom the sidelines, i.e. not leaving messages, but evidence from student comments suggest that\nthey have found it very helpful to watch the question-and-answer sessions, for example in the\nM205-Help conference approximately five questions per week were asked, but approximately\n35 students read each of these messages. Students were using the system to find out what\nhappened at any face-to-face tutorial they missed, and were also obtaining help with their\nM205 coursework.\nAlthough the tutorial conferences are not discussed in detail here, some were busier than\nothers. Students have reported that they have found it very helpful to have read-only access to\nall the tutorials apart from their own. It will be interesting to see in a later analysis if the\ntutorial conferences are used more for work-related dialogue as the course gets progressively\nharder.\nPlanned follow-up\nOne important finding to date has been that the tutors were not complaining of being\noverloaded with student messages, and follow-up studies will involve discussing with the\ntutors the effectiveness of the conference structure and how the role of the IMF reduced their\nperceived workload. The students were very interested in using M205-STTLE in the early part\nof the course; a follow-up survey to be conducted in December will indicate how well they\nwere motivated to use the system throughout the presentation of the course, and especially for\ntheir revision.\nConclusions\nThis paper proposed that student interactions while using a CMC could be monitored in the\nthree dimensions summarized in our introduction: a knowledge dimension (which includes\ndomain and meta-knowledge), a social dimension, and a motivational dimension.\n66\nALT-J Volume 4 Number \/\nBy comparing the social and help conferences (see Figures 2, 3,4 and 5), it can be seen that the\nsocial dimension was more important at the beginning. The critical period for the students to get\nto know each other and the system was one month. Only then did they make use of the system\nfor their coursework. It can be seen that use along the knowledge dimension then increased.\nAlthough specific conference areas, for example M205-Help and the tutorial conferences, were\nset up to deal with domain-specific interactions, the numbers of messages were deceptively\nsmall. This was due to the fact that more students were reading the messages rather than\ngenerating their own messages. Students said that because they had read-only access to all\ntutorials, they were obtaining enough information about their assignments by scanning all the\nmessages. Although only five or six messages were posted per week to the M205-Help\nconference, these messages were, surprisingly, read by more than 30 students. The motivational\ndimension became apparent from the students' enthusiasm to use M205-STILE to aid their\nstudy not only to describe their problems but also to read messages left by other students.\nM205-STILE was set up to minimize information overload for both tutors and students. An\nimportant factor could be the IMF's overall responsibility for designing the conference and\nsub-conference structure and guiding the tutor and student activity without intervening too\nmuch. The IMF designed conference areas to promote work-related dialogue, and to encourage\nthe students to help each other in a supervised environment. The latter point is important\nbecause without expert computer-science onlookers, the students could have confused each\nother. The IMF also played a role in promoting work-related dialogue by responding quickly to\nstudent problems with the technology itself.\nAcknowledgements\nThe research described in this paper was undertaken in the Computing Department, Faculty of\nMathematics and Computing at the Open University, as part of the STILE project.
