Historical production largely focused on \niron ore, coal, lead and salt, with in excess of 2000 abandoned mine workings.4 The \noccurrence of gold in Northern Ireland was originally documented in the mid-1600s with the \ndiscovery of alluvial grains in County Londonderry.10,19 The first modern gold exploration in \nNorthern Ireland was undertaken in the early 1980s in response to rising gold prices, interest \nin historical records of gold occurrences and a review of the mineral potential of the Sperrin \nMountains area conducted by the Geological Survey of Northern Ireland (GSNI).3 \nExploration primarily focused on determining bedrock sources of alluvial gold in the Sperrin \nMountains and successfully identified extensive shear zones with associated vein gold \nmineralisation in bedrock, indicative of a \u2018gold mineral province\u2019.19 The most significant \ndiscoveries were Curraghinalt and Cavanacaw, now the operating Omagh Mine.11,17,18,24,25  \nElsewhere Caledonian basement rocks north of the Iapetus suture in the British Isles also \ncontain significant gold mineralisation, from the Mayo-Curlew Basin of western Ireland \n(Cregganbaun and Croagh Patrick)56,58 through the North Western Basement and Longford \nDown Massif (Curraghinalt, Cavanacaw and Clontibret)16,45,52 and into Scotland (Cononish, \nCalliacher-Urlar Burn, Glenhead etc).22,38  \n  \nRising commodity prices in recent years have generated considerable interest in the mineral \npotential of Northern Ireland. In addition a wealth of new geological, geochemical and \ngeophysical data from the Tellus Project (2004\u201307) has provided new insights into the \ngeology of Northern Ireland and indicated potential for the discovery of new deposits in \nseveral areas. The present study aimed to assess the potential for shear zone associated vein-\nhosted gold mineralisation in north-west Northern Ireland using Geographic Information \nSystem (GIS)-based prospectivity analysis. The study area (3074 km2) includes the main tract \nof Dalradian rocks in north-west Northern Ireland and was selected because of its prospective \ngeology and known gold occurrences, including the major gold deposits of Curraghinalt and \nCavanacaw (Fig. 1). The study integrates the new Tellus geophysical and geochemical data, \nlegacy datasets and regional geological mapping within a framework provided by the latest \nmineral deposit models for vein-hosted gold mineralisation in Northern Ireland.  \n \nGEOLOGY \n \nFor its limited size (some 14 000 km2), Northern Ireland hosts a remarkable variety of \ngeology with rock representatives from the Mesoproterozoic through to the Palaeogene.  \nThese rocks contain evidence of major plate-tectonic events including the Palaeozoic \nGrampian and Caledonian orogenies, the late Palaeozoic Variscan Orogeny and the ongoing \nAlpine Orogeny.  Northern Ireland straddles the Southern Uplands-Down-Longford, the \nMidland Valley and the Central Highlands (Grampian), pre-late Palaeozoic basement \nterranes.9  The boundaries between these are the major, long-lived, Southern Uplands and \nHighland Boundary fault zones. The latter is well defined in Scotland, but less so in Northern \nIreland where it is concealed by Devonian and younger cover sequences and the Omagh \nThrust. \n \n \n4\u00a0\n\u00a0\n \nFig. 1 Geology of the study area showing the Dalradian formations, pre- and post-Dalradian geology27, \nprincipal structural features and mineral occurrences (Cu, Curraghinalt; Cv, Cavanacaw; Co, \nCornavarrow; Cv, Creevan Burn; Er, Erganagh Burn; Ry, Rylagh Burn; Gl, Glengawna; Gm, \nGlenmacoffer; Fa, Fallagh; Go, Golan Burn; Gl, Glenlark; Cr, Crosh). \u00a9 Crown copyright  \n \nThe prospectivity analysis focused on the Dalradian Supergroup in the Sperrin Mountains \nwhich is located in the Central Highlands Terrane and is part of the Caledonian orogenic belt \nextending into western Ireland and Scotland and further afield into Newfoundland and \nScandinavia. The Dalradian Supergroup was formed as a consequence of the late \nNeoproterozoic break-up of the supercontinent of Rodinia and the opening of the Iapetus \nOcean.51  Deposition took place along the eastern side of Laurentia where extensive passive \nmargin sedimentary sequences were formed in response to continental rifting and ocean \nwidening, lasting until the early Ordovician.54 The predominantly siliciclastic Dalradian \nsequences preserved in Scotland and Ireland record shallow to deep-water depositional \nenvironments with intercalated, subordinate lithologies related to periods of glaciation, \ncarbonate deposition and basic volcanism. \n \n5\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe regional structure and stratigraphy of the Dalradian Supergroup in the Sperrin Mountains \nhas been the subject of longstanding debate. Based on GSNI mapping, the preferred structural \ninterpretation is a broad anticline referred to as the Sperrin Nappe, which is considered \nanalogous to the Tay Nappe in Scotland.27,54 The Sperrin Nappe is south-east facing and \ncomposed mainly of Southern Highland Group formations disposed either side of an axis that \nruns within upper Argyll Group stratigraphy. An alternative model involves a greater \nproportion of Argyll Group stratigraphy forming the main Sperrin ridge, with a main axis \nlocated further south than proposed by GSNI.53 The structure and stratigraphy of the Sperrin \nMountains revealed by recent mapping of the Dungiven, Newtownstewartand Strabane  \n1:50 000 scale sheets is more consistent with the interpretation of Alsop and Hutton1, but \nappears to be far more structurally complicated than previously thought.28\u201330 From north-west \nto south-east, a succession of folds and thrust surfaces is identified that repeats a relatively \nthin portion of upper Argyll Group and lower Southern Highland Group stratigraphy. \n \nThe lower Ordovician Tyrone Igneous Complex (TIC) crops out to the south-west of the \nOmagh thrust and comprises the ophiolitic Tyrone Plutonic Group and overlying arc-related \nTyrone Volcanic Group.21,36 Together they structurally overlie sillimanite-grade paragneisses \nof the Tyrone Central Inlier which, based on detrital zircon age profiling, appear to be of \nUpper Dalradian Laurentian affinity. The obduction of the ophiolite appears to have taken \nplace at c. 475 Ma followed by the establishment of northward-directed subduction and the \nformation of a volcanic arc by c. 470 Ma.14 The thrusting of the Dalradian over the TIC is \nbelieved to have occurred c. 465 Ma during Grampian orogenesis. \n \nTwo major north\u2013south-trending, pre-Dalradian basement features, the Omagh Lineament \nand Draperstown Lineament have been recognised within the study area. Similar structures \nhave been identified in the Dalradian of north-west Donegal and south-west Scotland because \nof their influence on Dalradian sedimentation patterns and regional strike orientation.37 The \nOmagh Lineament is thought to be responsible for a major change in the orientation of \nbedding and of the dominant foliation in Dalradian rocks at the eastern end of the Lack \nInlier.26 \n \nPROSPECTIVITY ANALYSIS \n \nA mineral deposit model describes the essential attributes of a mineral deposit class, based on \nthe synthesis of large quantities of data derived from similar deposits worldwide. Key \nexploration criteria for a particular deposit class can be identified from the mineral deposit \nmodel, thus forming a basis for assessing mineral potential of a region.  \n \nIt has long been recognised that integration of multiple geoscience datasets is advantageous \nfor mineral exploration targeting. Geographical Information Systems (GIS) are now routinely \nused for the management, manipulation, processing and integration of voluminous spatial \nexploration datasets. Examination of multiple datasets in the GIS environment can aid the \ndetermination of features critical or incidental to the mineralisation process and emphasise \npatterns and associations that may not be obvious when the datasets are viewed in isolation. \nProspectivity analysis is a GIS-based predictive spatial analysis technique used to integrate \nmultiple exploration datasets in the framework of a mineral deposit model. The output of the \nprocess is a map displaying favourability for the occurrence of a particular mineral deposit \ntype.2  \n \n6\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSpatial data modelling methodologies used in prospectivity analysis can be divided into two \ncategories: knowledge-driven techniques, including Boolean logic, index overlay, and fuzzy \nlogic; and data-driven techniques, such as weights of evidence (WoE), logistic regression and \nneural networks.12 \n \nData-driven techniques, which were not utilised in this study, require a set of known mineral \noccurrences or \u2018training points\u2019. In this approach the data relationships at known occurrences \nare analysed to determine a \u2018fingerprint\u2019 of the target mineralisation and the weights allocated \nto different evidential themes are derived statistically.57  \n \nKnowledge-driven analysis is conducted by an \u2018expert\u2019 who identifies those criteria in the \nmineral deposit model that are critical to the formation of a deposit. The formation of a \nmineral deposit is likely to depend on the spatial and temporal coincidence of multiple \ncontrolling features. It is necessary to determine which of these characteristic features can be \nidentified in the exploration data to develop an exploration model. Frequently only part of the \nmineral deposit model can be mapped with the data available and the exploration model \ndefines which evidential data layers are used in the prospectivity analysis. Knowledge-driven \nanalysis is generally employed in regions with few or no known mineral occurrences. \nKnowledge-driven techniques are subjective in that they rely on expert opinion to determine \nweightings which rank the relative significance of the exploration criteria.  \n\u00a0\nKnowledge-driven prospectivity analysis using fuzzy logic was employed in this study. In \nclassical set theory an object is either a member of a set (membership = 1) or not a member \n(membership = 0), there is no intermediate state.2 In contrast the fuzzy logic method, based \non fuzzy-set theory devised by Zadeh61, allows assignment of weightings to exploration \ncriteria on a continuous scale from 1 (full membership) to 0 (full non-membership).2,12 Once \nfuzzy membership values have been assigned to evidential data layers they can be combined \nusing certain mathematical operators to produce a map of mineral potential.  \n \nThe fuzzy logic methodology has been applied to exploration for orogenic gold deposits in a \nnumber of areas including the Yilgarn Block of Western Australia,32,40 the Lynn Lake \nGreenstone Belt of Canada and the northern Fennoscandian Shield of Finland.43,49\u00a0 In the UK \nprospectivity analysis has been employed to determine favourable areas for lode gold \nmineralisation in the Scottish Dalradian,34\u00a0 turbidite-hosted gold deposits in the Lower \nPaleozoic Welsh Basin,20 epithermal gold mineralisation in the Devonian rocks of northern \nBritain35 and stratiform massive sulphide mineralisation in south-west England.7  \n \nThis study utilised the free internet downloadable Spatial Data Modeller extension (Arc-\nSDM, version 3.1),50 with ESRI\u2019s ArcGIS software described by Raines and Bonham-\nCarter47, making use of ESRI\u2019s Spatial Analysis extension for much of the data pre-\nprocessing.  \n \n \nMINERAL DEPOSIT MODELS AND KEY EXPLORATION CRITERIA \n \nOrogenic vein-hosted gold mineralisation  \n \nGold mineralisation is widely developed throughout the Caledonian orogenic belt, from \nScandinavia in the north to the south-eastern USA in the south. Goldfarb et al.31 identified \ngold deposits associated with the Caledonian Orogeny in the British Isles as examples of \n7\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPalaeozoic orogenic gold mineralisation. It is generally accepted that orogenic gold \nmineralisation is associated with low salinity (typically in the range of 3\u20137 wt. % eq. NaCl), \nmixed aqueous-carbonic fluids, transporting gold as reduced sulphur complexes, derived \nfrom either metamorphic devolatilisation or a deep magmatic source. Mineralising conditions \ngenerally fall in the range of 1.0\u20132.5 kbars at 300\u2013350oC.48 Orogenic gold deposits are \ntypified by quartz-carbonate-dominant vein systems associated with deformed metamorphic \nterranes of all ages. Mineralisation displays strong structural controls at a variety of scales. \nDeposits are most commonly located on second- or third-order structures in the vicinity of \nlarge-scale compressional or transpressional structures formed at convergent margins (Table \n1).33  \n \nCriteria Identified in project area \nCollisional tectonic regime Yes \nMajor accretionary boundary structures Yes \n\u2018First-order\u2019 transcrustal structures Yes \nHigh angle \u2018second-order faults\u2019 related to major structures  Yes \nRocks of greenschist metamorphic grade Yes \nMineralisation is post-peak metamorphism (i.e. late syncollisional) Yes \nLate syncollisional, intermediate to felsic magmatism Yes \nTabular veins in more competent lithologies with veinlets and stringers \nforming stockworks in less competent units \nYes \nOre mineralogy: gold, pyrite, arsenopyrite, native gold, Cu, Pb, Zn and Sb \nsulphides \nYes \nGangue mineralogy dominated by quartz \uf0b1 carbonate, feldspar, mica Yes \nWall-rock alteration Yes \nElevated values of Au, Ag, As, Sb, K, Li, Bi, W, Te, Cu, Pb, Zn, Cd in \nrock, soil and stream-sediment \nSelected elements (see text \nfor discussion) \nC-O-H \uf0b1 N, near-neutral to low pH, low salinity fluids Yes \nTable 1 Characteristics of Phanerozoic orogenic vein gold mineralisation and their occurrence in the \nstudy area (criteria compiled from: Bierlein and Crowe8; Ash et al.5; Nesbitt42; Earls et al.26). \nVein-hosted gold mineralisation in Northern Ireland \n \nVarious recent publications have greatly advanced the understanding of gold mineralisation \nin the Sperrin Mountains of Northern Ireland e.g. Earls et al.26,\u00a0Wilkinson et al.59, Parnell et \nal.45. The majority of research has focused on the deposits at Curraghinalt and Cavanacaw \nfrom which the prospectivity models used in this study have been generated. The following \nsummary is derived chiefly from Earls et al.26. \n \nStructure appears to be the most significant factor controlling the distribution of auriferous \ngold veins in the Sperrin Mountains. Earls et al.\u00a026 suggest that the interplay of three principal \ngeological structures influences the location of gold mineralisation (Fig. 1): \n \n1. The north-north-east-trending Omagh Lineament. Based on the distribution of gold and \narsenic anomalies and the north-north-east to north\u2013south orientation of mineralised veins \nin the vicinity of the Lack Inlier, Earls et al.\u00a026 conclude that the Omagh Lineament has a \nsignificant control on the location and orientation of mineralised veins. \n2. The north-east-trending Omagh Thrust which demarcates the southern boundary of the \n\u2018Lack \u2013 Curraghinalt zone\u2019 and separates the Dalradian from the underlying TIC. During \nthe early to mid Ordovician the Dalradian was thrust over the volcanic rocks of the TIC \nalong this zone of south-east directed thrusting. Subsequent reactivation during the \n8\u00a0\n\u00a0\nVariscan (c. 300 Ma) resulted in thrusting of the Dalradian over Carboniferous and \nDevonian rocks in addition to the TIC.\u00a026 \n3. The west-north-west-trending, north-dipping Curraghinalt Lateral Ramp. This positive \nrelief structure developed within the TIC in the footwall of the Omagh Thrust, resulted in \na regime of north-west-directed extension and the formation of east\u2013west orientated \naccommodation structures.\u00a026 \n \nThe principal exploration targets for gold mineralisation in the Sperrin Mountains are \nDalradian metasedimentary rocks (Table 2). Arthurs3 indicates that \u201cthe main (Dalradian) \nprospecting targets are within the \u2026. Glengawna Formation and the Dungiven Formation\u201d. In \naddition, Lower Carboniferous and other post-Dalradian lithologies have also been \nconsidered prospective for gold mineralisation, following the proposal by Wilkinson et al.59 \nthat pre-existing Caledonian gold mineralisation may have been remobilised by later low-\ntemperature brines.  \n \nIn general, mineralised veins are preferentially developed in relatively brittle psammitic units \nin contrast to the more ductile pelites.19,26  It is therefore suggested that particular Dalradian \nformations are more prospective for gold mineralisation based on their favourable rheological \nproperties and the distribution of known occurrences (Table 2). Earls et al.26 indicate an \napparent association between gold mineralisation and graphitic pelite horizons of the \nGlengawna Formation. This association may be attributed to the rheological contrast between \nthe graphitic pelites and associated lithologies and\/or the presence of a reducing environment \npromoting gold deposition associated with the graphitic pelites.  \n \nFormation name Rank \nGlengawna Formation 10 \nMullaghcarn Formation 8 \nDungiven Formation (Carbonates) 6 \nDungiven Formation (Non-carbonate) 5 \nGlenelly Formation 5 \nDart Formation 5 \nNewtownstewart Formation 5 \nLondonderry Formation 3 \nBallykelly Formation 5 \nTable 2 Relative ranking of principal Dalradian formations in the Sperrins based on their favourability \nfor hosting gold mineralisation (10 = highest favourability)  \n \nQuartz is the dominant gangue mineral associated with the gold mineralisation but several \ncarbonate phases, including calcite, dolomite and siderite, also occur. Multiple stages of \nquartz deposition and a range of sulphide minerals, including pyrite, arsenopyrite, \nchalcopyrite, galena and sphalerite, are recognised in the auriferous veins throughout the \nSperrins.26,45\u00a0 Earls et al.26 report that wallrock alteration at Curraghinalt is limited but \npotassic and argillic alteration are commonly associated with the veins at other localities. \nCurraghinalt \n \nThe Curraghinalt deposit consists of a series of west-north-west-trending, north-east-dipping \ngold-bearing quartz veins, related to east\u2013west-trending vertical and north-dipping shear \nzones. The auriferous veins are cut by low angle, north-dipping thrust faults and north-east-\ntrending normal faults.19,26,45 Structural evidence suggests that Curraghinalt overlies a lateral \nramp structure. Earls et al.26 propose a model whereby space was created by predominantly \n9\u00a0\n\u00a0\neast-south-east-directed thrusting over the footwall ramp, resulting in the formation of east\u2013\nwest orientated accommodation structures. Minor changes in thrusting direction relative to \nthe strike of the ramp resulted in both contractional and extensional deformation of the \nhanging wall Dalradian rocks creating space in the system.26 The veins bifurcate, pinch and \nswell along strike in a host sequence of pelites, semipelites and psammites, varying in width \nfrom a few millimetres up to 3 m.4,19 Curraghinalt is located within rocks of the Dalradian \nMullaghcarn Formation.  \nCavanacaw \n \nThe Cavanacaw deposit, discovered in 1985, is located in the eastern part of the Lack Inlier \nwhich is mapped by the GSNI as entirely Mullaghcarn Formation (Fig. 1).27 However, \nlithological descriptions from the deposit suggest it may be hosted in both the Mullaghcarn \nand Glengawna Formations.26 The largest mineralised structure at Cavanacaw, the Kearney \nvein, strikes north\u2013south, whilst an additional set of veins strikes south-east. An east-north-\neast-striking fracture system known locally as the \u2018Lack Shear\u2019 displaces both vein sets.16  \nOther vein-hosted gold occurrences  \n \nIn addition to Curraghinalt and Cavanacaw other notable mineralised localities in the district \ninclude (Fig. 1): \n\uf0b7 Golan Burn, approximately 4 km west-north-west of Curraghinalt, which may represent \nthe north-west strike extension of the Curraghinalt mineralisation;4 \n\uf0b7 Glenlark Lodge 5 km north-north-east of Curraghinalt, which consists of quartz vein \nand stratiform sulphide mineralisation; \n\uf0b7 Rylagh Burn and Erganagh Burn, north-east of Cavanacaw, which comprise north\u2013\nsouth-trending, shear zone-associated auriferous quartz veins; \n\uf0b7 Creeven Burn, to the south of Cavanacaw, where mineralisation is associated with the \n\u2018Lack Shear\u2019 and graphitic pelites; \n\uf0b7 Cornavarrow, west of Creevan Burn, also within the \u2018Lack Shear\u2019, where auriferous \nquartz veins are hosted in low-angle faults in graphitic pelites and psammites.26 \n \nDeposit-scale variations \n \nStructure \n \nAlthough the Curraghinalt and Cavanacaw deposits have many common features, significant \ndifferences are observed at the local scale, in the principal structural controls, mineralogy and \ngeochemical signatures. As a result two separate prospectivity models, referred to as the \nCurraghinalt and Cavanacaw models, were utilised in this study.  \n \nThe north-east-trending Omagh Thrust and the inferred north\u2013south-trending basement \nlineaments are considered prospective in both models due their regional influence as zones of \nfluid flow and structural control. The deposits at Curraghinalt and Cavanacaw both lie in \nclose proximity to these structures. The Omagh Thrust is directly linked to space creation in \nthe vicinity of Curraghinalt and is accordingly given greater weighting in the Curraghinalt \nmodel. Greater significance is assigned to the basement lineaments and north\u2013south-trending \nfaults in the Cavanacaw model as the Omagh Lineament is thought to have allowed the \nDalradian to accommodate north\u2013south-trending veins and extensional shear zones such as \nthose which occur at Cavanacaw and Rylagh Burn.26 \n10\u00a0\n\u00a0\n \nNorth-east-trending structures are considered prospective in both models, reflecting the \nimportance and orientation of the Omagh Thrust and related parallel structures. This trend \nalso corresponds to the orientation of the normal faults cutting the veins at Curraghinalt. This \norientation has greater significance in the Curraghinalt model due to the close association \nbetween the north-east-trending Omagh Thrust and space creation in the deposit.  \n \nEast- to east-south-east-trending structures are considered highly prospective in the \nCurraghinalt model on the basis of the orientation of the Curraghinalt vein swarm (east-\nsouth-east) which appears related to east-west-trending shear zones.26 The Curraghinalt \nlateral ramp also has the same trend. This structure is not represented as a separate entity in \nthe model as its position and extent are not clearly defined.   \n \nOn account of the presence of the subsidiary vein set associated with the deposit at \nCavanacaw and the orientation of the Omagh Thrust, south-south-east- and east-north-east-\ntrending structures are included as exploration criteria in the Cavanacaw model.16  \n \nGeochemistry \n \nGeochemical data from the Curraghinalt and Cavanacaw deposits indicates that there are \nsignificant differences between the mineralisation at the two localities. Earls et al.26 \nundertook a comprehensive review of the geochemistry of a wide range of host rock and vein \nsamples from Curraghinalt, Cavanacaw, Golan Burn and other vein occurrences throughout \nthe Sperrin Mountains.  \n \nSilver is associated with both Au (in electrum) and Pb (in galena) in the veins in both \ndeposits. Although the mineralisation at Cavanacaw is considerably richer in Ag, there is a \nstrong positive correlation between Au and Ag at Curraghinalt. In comparison to Cavanacaw, \nCurraghinalt veins have greater Bi and Cu concentrations and lower Pb, As and Sb \nconcentrations. The Au contents of the Curraghinalt veins are correlated with those of Bi, and \nto a lesser extent of As, while at Cavancaw Au is associated with enrichment in Ag, As, Ce, \nCu and Pb. The base metals Cu, Pb and Zn are all present in sulphides at Cavanacaw with \ngalena being relatively common. The Curraghinalt mineralisation is distinctly poor in Pb and \nsphalerite has not been identified in the deposit.26  \n \nEarls et al.26 also undertook a review of stream-sediment data from the Sperrin Mountains \nand compared this with the lithogeochemical data. Arsenic values are generally high over \nmuch of the Sperrins with the highest values occurring at Cavanacaw and other localities \nclose to the Omagh Thrust. The distribution of Cu shows a stratigraphical control, with above \naverage concentrations over the Dart and Glenelly Formations. Highly anomalous Pb values \nare observed south-west and north-east of Omagh in the vicinity of the Omagh Thrust and \nCavanacaw. According to Earls et al.26 Pb anomalies disappear rapidly along strike to the \nnorth-east and are not observed in stream sediment samples from the Curraghinalt area. \nNeither Curraghinalt nor Cavanacaw are associated with high Zn values in stream sediments.  \n \nDATA AND EXPLORATION CRITERIA \n \nBased on the generalised deposit model for shear zone associated vein-gold mineralisation \nand the specific characteristics of the gold mineralisation in Northern Ireland a range of \n11\u00a0\n\u00a0\nexploration criteria was defined for use in this analysis.

Sub-divisions of the Dalradian Supergroup were retained so that \ndifferent fuzzy membership values could be assigned to individual Dalradian formations, \nbased on their perceived prospectivity for gold mineralisation (Table 2). The only exploration \ncriterion identified which was not incorporated in the modelling was alteration. This was \nomitted due to lack of an appropriate alteration dataset.  \nStructural criteria \n \nStructural data was derived from two sources: geological mapping and geophysical data \nanalysis. Structural exploration criteria are detailed in Table 4.  \n \nSignificance Criteria \nCurraghinalt Cavanacaw \nProximity to Omagh Thrust h m \nProximity to basement lineaments l h \nProximity to NE\u2013SW structures h l \nProximity to N\u2013S structures l h \nProximity to E\u2013W to ESE\u2013WNW \nstructures \nh na \nProximity to SSE\u2013NNW structures na m \nProximity to ENE\u2013WSW structures na m \n \nAu in stream-sediment samples h h \nAg in stream-sediment samples m m \nAs in stream-sediment samples m h \nCu in stream-sediment samples l m \nPb in stream-sediment samples l h \nZn in stream-sediment samples l l \n \nTable 4 The relative significance assigned to \u2018first-order\u2019 transcrustal structures, other structural vectors \nand geochemical criteria in the two prospectivity models used in this study, referred to as the \n\u2018Curraghinalt\u2019 and \u2018Cavanacaw\u2019 models. Significance: h, high; m, medium; l, low; na, not applicable \nMapping \n \nMapped faults and shear zones, as shown on the 1:250 000 scale geological map of Northern \nIreland, are direct evidence of deformation (Fig. 1). More than a thousand \u2018mapped\u2019 \nstructures occur within the study area. The most prominent of these is the Omagh Thrust.27 \nThe Omagh Thrust and basement lineaments were treated separately from other structures in \n13\u00a0\n\u00a0\nthis analysis due to their regional influence and major control on the location of \nmineralisation in the study area.  \nGeophysics \n \nAeromagnetic and electromagnetic (EM) data from the Tellus airborne survey were \nincorporated into the prospectivity analysis. The survey was flown at an elevation of 56 m in \nrural areas rising to 240 m in urban areas with survey lines spaced at 200 m intervals. Full \ndetails of the survey are documented in Beamish et al.6. In addition BGS regional gravity \ndata was included in this study as it is useful for identifying major regional crustal structures. \nThe density of gravity data coverage for Northern Ireland is approximately 1 station per \n1.25 km2.  \n \nA series of high-resolution regional images of the magnetic, electromagnetic and gravity data \nwere analysed in ArcGIS and the main structural elements identified and digitised (Fig. 2).  \nThe main features obtained from each dataset were:  \n \n1. Magnetic data - lineaments related to faults, shear zones, fold structures and dyke swarms;  \n2. EM data - principal EM conductors, fault-related conductors and anomaly offsets;  \n3. Gravity data - lineaments attributed to faults and deep seated structures. \n \nMagnetic lineaments were extracted from various images, chiefly the reduced-to-pole field, \nthe residual magnetic field derived by upward continuation to 500 m, and the 1st vertical \nderivative field. The residual and 1st vertical derivative field magnetic images were \nparticularly effective in identifying short wavelength, near-surface features including faults, \nmagnetic horizons and minor intrusions. The horizontal gradient of the magnetic \npseudogravity was particularly successful in identifying many short wavelength lineaments \nprimarily associated with fold structures and structural trends. \nMapped faults, shear zones and geophysical lineaments were treated as a single evidence \nlayer in the modelling and it is assumed that they represent the same style of deformation. \n \nGeochemical criteria \n \nStream-sediment geochemical data was incorporated in the prospectivity analysis. The basic \npremise underlying the use of stream sediments in mineral exploration is that they are \ncomposite samples produced by erosion and weathering and thus represent the source \ncatchment area, including any contained metalliferous mineralisation, of the stream drainage \nnetwork. Regional stream-sediment data are therefore preferred to regional soil data in this \ntype of study. \n \nIn the Tellus project stream-sediment samples were collected from first- and second-order \nstreams over eastern Northern Ireland at an average density of 1 sample per 2.15 km2. For \nwestern Northern Ireland data from stream-sediment samples (39 analytes) collected in an \nearlier programme were integrated with the Tellus dataset and have been used in the present \nstudy. In total 1476 stream-sediment sample sites are located within the study area.  \n    \n14\u00a0\n\u00a0\n \nFig. 2 Lineaments picked from the Tellus geophysical data. Note features representing dykes were not \nincluded in the analysis \n \nThe choice of elements used in this analysis was guided by the target mineral deposit type \nand by a review of previous geochemical data for the area (Table 5). Gridded geochemical \nmaps, based on percentiles, were created for each of the selected elements. It is notable that \nAg displays much less variation in concentration than Au and other potential pathfinder \nelements indicated by the deposit models. This suggests that Ag in stream sediments is \npotentially of limited value as an indicator of gold mineralisation in this terrane. Sb and Bi \nwere not included on account of their generally low values within the stream-sediment \ndataset.  \n \nElement Maximum Mean Median 75% 90% 95% 98% 99% \nAu 3485 18 1 2 8 25 91 350 \nAg 9 0.7 0.5 0.5 1 2 3 5 \nAs 1400 27 12 25 57 96 150 231 \nCu 162 31 26 37 58 71 87 94 \nPb 207 37 33 42 54 65 76 93 \nZn 1524 140 123 159 226 291 394 477 \nTable 5 Summary univariate statistics for stream-sediment data for the study area. All values in ppm, \nexcept Au in ppb (n=1474 for all elements with the exception of Au, n=1376) \n \nMineral occurrences \n \nSelected mineral occurrences from the GSNI Mineral Occurrence Database (MOD) were \nincorporated into the prospectivity analysis. This database contains records of 430 mineral \noccurrences in Northern Ireland 154 of which occur in the study area. The database was \nfiltered to retain occurrences of the following types:  \n15\u00a0\n\u00a0\n \n1. Metallic sulphides-oxides-carbonates and sulphates in bedrock (n=31);  \n2. Metallic sulphides-oxides-carbonates and sulphates in float (n=6);  \n3. Gangue minerals (n=7).  \n \nA relatively low weighting was assigned to this data in the prospectivity analysis because \nsome records in the database are incomplete while some others of, say, pyrite, are more likely \nto be related to diagenesis and metamorphism than to mineralisation.  \n \nObservations of visible gold grains made during collection of panned heavy mineral \nconcentrates in the Tellus geochemical sampling were utilised in the analysis (n=19). \nOccurrences of gold in bedrock were excluded from the modelling as these were \nsubsequently used to validate the results of the prospectivity analysis. \n \nData processing \n \nA proximity analysis (\u2018buffering\u2019) was performed on linear features (faults, geophysical \nlineaments) and point themes (mineral occurrences) such that the weighting of a particular \nfeature in the analysis decreases with increasing distance from that feature. Features in each \nof the themes were buffered at variable intervals.  The datasets were assigned variable buffer \ndistances depending on the likely extent of influence of a particular feature. \n \nPROSPECTIVITY MAPPING USING FUZZY LOGIC \n \nEach evidential theme in the exploration model for vein-hosted gold mineralisation in \nNorthern Ireland (Table 3) was assigned fuzzy membership values on the basis of the mineral \ndeposit model. Table 6 and Table 7 show the fuzzy membership values allocated to evidential \nthemes common to both the Curraghinalt and Cavanacaw models. Tables 8\u201311 show fuzzy \nmembership values for criteria which differ between the two models. The weighting assigned \nto each evidence layer is also dependent on the relative importance of one dataset against \nanother.  \n \nFormation name or stratigraphic grouping Fuzzy membership value \nGlengawna Formation 0.70 \nMullaghcarn Formation 0.61 \nDungiven Formation (carbonates) 0.53 \nDungiven Formation (non-carbonate) 0.49 \nGlenelly Formation 0.49 \nDart Formation 0.49 \nNewtownstewart Formation 0.49 \nLondonderry Formation 0.40 \nBallykelly Formation 0.40 \nClaudy Formation (Dart equivalent) 0.49 \nKilleter Formation (Newtownstewart equivalent) 0.49 \nAghyaran Formation (Dungiven equivalent)     0.49 \nMullyfa Formation (Dart equivalent)  0.49 \nLough Eske Formation   0.40 \nLough Mourne Formation 0.40 \nCroaghgarrow Formation (Glengawna equivalent) 0.70 \nPre-Dalradian 0.30 \nPost-Dalradian 0.20 \n16\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTable 6 Fuzzy membership values assigned to Dalradian formations \n \n\u00a0\nBuffer distance (km) 0.0\u20130.5 0.5\u20131.0 1.0\u20131.5 1.5\u20132.0 2.0\u20132.5 2.5\u20133.0 3.0\u20133.5 3.5\u20134.0 \n Fuzzy membership values  \nPanned gold occurrence 0.70 0.61 0.53 0.44 0.36 0.27 0.19 0.10 \nMetallic minerals in bedrock 0.20 0.17 0.13 0.10 \nMetallic minerals in float 0.20 0.10 \nGangue minerals 0.20 0.17 0.13 0.10  \nTable 7 Fuzzy membership values assigned to buffers around known mineral occurrences \n \n \nBuffer distance (km) 0\u20131 1\u20132 2\u20133 3\u20134 4\u20135 5\u20136 6\u20137 7\u20138 \n Model Fuzzy membership values  \nOmagh Thrust Cr 0.70 0.61 0.53 0.44 0.36 0.27 0.19 0.10 \n Cv 0.50 0.44 0.39 0.33 0.27 0.21 0.16 0.10 \nTable 8 Fuzzy membership values assigned to buffers around the Omagh Thrust (Cr, Curraghinalt \nmodel; Cv, Cavanacaw model) \n \nBuffer distance (km) 0\u20131 1\u20132 2\u20134 4\u20136 6\u20138 8\u201310 10\u201312 12\u201316 \n Model Fuzzy membership values  \nBasement lineaments Cr 0.40 0.36 0.33 0.29 0.25 0.21 0.18 0.10 \n Cv 0.70 0.63 0.55 0.48 0.40 0.33 0.25 0.10 \nTable 9 Fuzzy membership values assigned to buffers around basement lineaments (Cr, Curraghinalt \nmodel; Cv, Cavanacaw model) \n \nBuffer distance (km) 0\u20131 1\u20132 2\u20133 3\u20134 \nOrientation Model Fuzzy membership values  \nNE\u2013SW  Cr 0.60 0.43 0.27 0.1 \nNE\u2013SW  Cv 0.45 0.33 0.22 0.1 \nN\u2013S  Cr 0.40 0.30 0.20 0.1 \nN\u2013S  Cv 0.70 0.50 0.30 0.1 \nE\u2013W to ESE\u2013WNW  Cr 0.70 0.50 0.30 0.10 \nSSE\u2013NNW  Cv 0.50 0.40 0.30 0.10 \nENE\u2013WSW  Cv 0.45 0.33 0.22 0.10 \nTable 10 Fuzzy membership values assigned to buffers around \u2018second-order\u2019 structures (Cr, \nCurraghinalt model; Cv, Cavanacaw model) \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n \nCurraghinalt model  \nPercentiles 99 95 90 75 50 \n17\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCurraghinalt model \n Fuzzy membership values \nAu  0.70 0.60 0.50 0.40 0.20 \nAg 0.50 0.40 0.30 0.20 0.10 \nAs  0.50 0.40 0.30 0.20 0.10 \nCu  0.40 0.35 0.30 0.20 0.10 \nPb  0.25 0.20 0.15 0.10 0.10 \nZn  0.20 0.15 0.10 0.10 0.10 \nCavanacaw model \n Fuzzy membership values \nAu  0.70 0.60 0.50 0.40 0.20 \nAg  0.60 0.50 0.40 0.30 0.20 \nAs  0.60 0.50 0.40 0.30 0.20 \nPb  0.60 0.50 0.40 0.30 0.20 \nCu  0.40 0.35 0.30 0.20 0.10 \nZn  0.25 0.20 0.15 0.10 0.10 \nTable 11 Fuzzy membership values assigned to each class in the geochemistry data theme for the two \nmodels \n \nA map of mineral potential was created by combining the evidential themes in two stages \nusing fuzzy logic operators (Fig. 3).

The \ncombined structural dataset was filtered to include only structures with specific orientations \nbased on empirical observations of structures at Curraghinalt and Cavanacaw (Table 4). For \neach preferred direction a window of \u00b1 10\u00ba was utilised so that vectors with orientations close \nto the specified direction were also included.  \n \nThe second stage of the integration process combined the fuzzy membership values from \neach theme using the fuzzy gamma operator. The fuzzy gamma (\uf067) operator is a combination \nof fuzzy algebraic product and fuzzy algebraic sum. Its use is a compromise between the \n\u2018increasive\u2019 nature of fuzzy algebraic sum and the \u2018decreasive\u2019 effects of the fuzzy algebraic \nproduct (Table 12). \uf067 values range between 0 and 1 and when \uf067 is 0, the combination is the \nsame as fuzzy algebraic product and, when \uf067 is 1, it equals the fuzzy algebraic sum. The \neffect of selecting different \uf067 values was investigated by Bonham-Carter12. Previous studies \nsuggest \uf067 values in the region of 0.9 are most suitable for prospectivity mapping,2,23,41,55 \nalthough other studies have utilsed lower \uf067 values of around 0.75.13,44,46 Choice of \uf067 value is \nultimately subjective and several were tested in this analysis. A value of 0.9 produced the \noptimum results and was used in this study. The process was run separately for each deposit \nmodel allowing the individual characteristics of Curraghinalt and Cavanacaw to be taken into \naccount. \n \nRESULTS AND VALIDATION \n \nThe results of the analysis based on the two separate deposit models are shown in Fig. 4 and \nFig. 5 and summarised in Table 13. Validation of the results of the analysis is important to \ndetermine how accurately the exploration criteria have been translated into the prospectivity \nmodels. Since the exploration criteria are largely based upon two deposits this can be judged \nin part by the spatial correlation between these deposits and the prospectivity maps. \nSecondly, it is important to determine the reliability of the results of the analysis in order to \nunderstand its value for identifying new gold targets. For the purpose of validating the \nmodelling the \u2018other vein-hosted gold occurrences\u2019 described previously can be considered \n\u2018unknown\u2019 to the model.  \n \n \n \n19\u00a0\n\u00a0\n \n \nFig. 4 The distribution of prospectivity based on the Curraghinalt model.

The areas of highest potential were divided into three prospectivity classes; very \nhigh, high, and moderate and displayed using a gradational colour scale.  \n \nRegional prospectivity analysis, covering an area of 3074 km2, using the two models has \nidentified several areas prospective for vein-hosted gold mineralisation disposed in four \ngroups. There is generally a good correlation between the validation points and the \ndistribution of gold prospectivity. The Curraghinalt and Cavanacaw deposits are located \nwithin areas of very high and high prospectivity on their respective maps. All of the known \noccurrences are located within the area of highest potential on the Curraghinalt map and all \nbut one occurrence falls within this area on the Cavanacaw map. Both models clearly \ndelineate the \u2018Lack \u2013 Curraghinalt zone\u2019, with a belt of almost continuous high prospectivity \nextending from Glenlark in the north-east to Cavanacaw in the south-west and beyond.  \n \nCurraghinalt-Golan Burn zone and eastwards (areas A\u2013E) \n \nThree prominent areas of high prospectivity are evident on the map generated by the \nCurraghinalt model, extending from the eastern limit of the Newtownstewart Basin, through \nGolan Burn and Curraghinalt (A), over the Omagh Thrust (B) and southwards beyond the \nDalradian outcrop (C). On the map derived from the Cavanacaw model this region displays \nhigh prospectivity, although discrete zones are less pronounced. The prospective zone \nassociated with the Curraghinalt deposit (A) extends westwards for approximately 7 km, \nbefore dying out on the eastern side of the Newtownstewart Basin. Both Curraghinalt and \nGolan Burn are offset from the area of maximum prospectivity within zone A. The three \nprospective areas (A, B and C) lie on the same trend as the major fault bounding the southern \nside of the Newtownstewart Basin. \n \nFarther east the prospective areas are generally smaller and more focused, with a bull\u2019s eye \ntarget straddling a distinct jog in the Omagh Thrust (D). Farther east another prospective area \n(E) is prominent on the Curraghinalt map. It is associated with the Dalradian Glenelly \nFormation and subordinate Carboniferous sedimentary rocks, and is also influenced by both \nthe Omagh Thrust and Draperstown Lineament.  \n \nThe Lack Inlier (areas F\u2013J) \n \nA number of prospective areas occur around the Lack Inlier, all associated with the \nMullaghcarn Formation. As would be expected the analysis based on the Cavanacaw model \nreturns higher levels of prospectivity in the vicinity of the Cavanacaw deposit.\u00a0 Cavanacaw \nand Creevan Burn fall within an elongated zone of high to very high prospectivity on the \nsouth-eastern side of the Lack Inlier (F), offset to the west by around 1.5 km from the point \nof maximum prospectivity. In contrast, on the map based on the Curraghinalt model, \nCavanacaw and Creevan Burn are located in an area of lower prospectivity between two \ndiscrete highs. Further isolated zones of moderate to high prospectivity occur along the \nsouthern boundary of the Lack Inlier, west of Cavanacaw e.g. area G. Both maps include a \nprominent, elongate area of very high prospectivity on the northern side of the Lack Inlier, \nextending into the Carboniferous Omagh-Kesh Basin (H). Another largely continuous area of \nhigh to very high prospectivity extends from the north-east corner of the Lack Inlier \neastwards, towards Rylagh and Erganagh Burn (I). This area is underlain by both Dalradian \nand Carboniferous rocks.  \n23\u00a0\n\u00a0\n \nAlong strike to the north-east of Cavanacaw an extensive area (J) of very high prospectivity \nis evident on Fig. 4 and Fig. 5. The area is mostly underlain by the Mullaghcarn Formation \nbut it straddles the Omagh Thrust, extending southwards over the Ordovician TIC. Zone J is \nof particular interest as it lies along strike from Cavanacaw and is also located at the eastern \nend of a series of prospective zones (K, L, M)  trending west-north-west which passes through \nthe gold occurrences of Rylagh and Erganagh Burn.  \nNorth of the Omagh-Kesh Basin (areas K\u2013M)  \nThree areas of high to moderate prospectivity occur to the west of the main prospective area \nassociated with the \u2018Lack \u2013 Curraghinalt zone\u2019. Two of these are present in the results of both \nmodels (K, L). These areas are situated within an east-west-trending package of Dalradian \nrocks (Claudy, Dungiven, Newtownstewart Formations), containing pre-Caledonian \nmetabasite intrusions and bounded to the north and south by Carboniferous basins. The \nprospective areas are structurally controlled with L and M  located along the faulted boundary \nof the Carboniferous Omagh-Kesh Basin.  \nNorthern and eastern outliers (areas N\u2013Q) \nA zone of moderate to high prospectivity occurs directly north of Rylagh and Erganagh Burn \non the Cavanacaw map. It coincides with the change in strike of the Dalradian rocks, close to \nthe hinge of the Sperrin Nappe, and the inferred trace of the Omagh Lineament (N), which \npotentially links it with the occurrences to the south. To the north-east a zone of moderate \nprospectivity (O) is underlain by the Claudy Formation, proximal to the hinge of the Sperrin \nNappe. The northernmost prospective area (P), only evident on the Cavanacaw map, is \nassociated with a north-north-west-trending fault. A further outlier (Q) occurs to the east of \nthe study area, associated with the Dalradian Dart Formation and Carboniferous sedimentary \nrocks, and is influenced by the Draperstown Lineament. These prospective areas, remote \nfrom the \u2018Lack \u2013 Curraghinalt zone\u2019, all occur close to inferred basement lineaments.  \nDISCUSSION \nMany of the target areas defined  by the prospectivity analysis coincide with known vein-\nhosted gold occurrences while others occur in areas delineated as prospective by previous \nwork e.g. Earls et al.26 The prospectivity analysis has generated considerably more focused \ntargets for follow-up investigation compared with previous regional studies. Of particular \ninterest are the under-explored areas outside the Lack-Curraghinalt zone including K, L, M, \nN, O, P and area Q located on the Tow Valley Fault.  The Newtownstewart-Baronscourt-\nCastlederg area in which targets K\u2013M are located is associated with extensive geochemical \nanomalies for As, Zn and Ba in Tellus soils data. Vein-hosted barite-base-metal \nmineralisation is also reported from the Baronscourt area. Although the metabasite intrusions \nmay represent a potential source of gold pre-Caledonian intrusive rocks have not been \nconsidered by previous authors to play a role in the genesis of these deposits. \nThe modelling confirms that the Lack Inlier and its environs extending eastwards are highly \nprospective, as indicated by areas of relatively high prospectivity extending south-west of \nCornavarrow. The prospectivity maps also suggest that the faults bounding the northern and \neastern side of the Lack Inlier are highly prospective.  \n \nAlthough there is generally a good correlation between known gold occurrences and the \ndistribution of gold prospectivity it is important to note that the deposits at Curraghinalt and \n24\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCavanacaw do not coincide with the areas of maximum prospectivity generated by the \nmodelling. This may be attributed to a combination of factors, including: \n \n1. Incomplete understanding of geological controls on the location of mineralisation; \n2. Inability to  accurately translate the exploration criteria into the prospectivity models;  \n3. Utilisation of regional scale datasets in the analysis with deposit models based on local \ndata; \n4. General data incompatibility issues e.g. the airborne geophysics and geochemical data \nhave very different sample intervals. The issue of integrating different scale datasets in \nprospectivity analysis has not been widely explored in the literature and consequently the \neffect on the modelling remains unclear;  \n5. The subjective nature of fuzzy logic modelling. This approach is strongly dependent on \nexpert judgement to determine the key exploration indicators based on the mineral deposit \nmodel, to assign weightings, zones and styles of influence, and to select the fuzzy logic \noperators used to combine the datasets. \n \nAlthough the gold favourability maps have considerably reduced the search area for gold \nmineralisation in the study area (3074 km2) the total prospective zone remains relatively large \nat approximately 350 km2. This is a consequence of using regional scale datasets which are \nnot optimal for the delineation of smaller prospective targets. \n \nOverall there is close correlation between the Curraghinalt and Cavanacaw model results, \nwith some variations in the position, extent and degree of prospectivity of the target areas. \nThe differences in the results generated by the two models, notably areas M to Q on the \nCavanacaw map and the intensity of prospectivity in the south-east corner of the Lack Inlier \nresults from the different significance attributed to structural and geochemical parameters in \neach model (Table 4 and discussed in deposit-scale variations). The areas prospective or more \nprospective on the Cavanacaw map result from a combination of favourable structural  and \ngeochemical criteria (Table 13), principally high values for arsenic, lead and copper in stream \nsediments and the influence of the Omagh Lineament and other structural vectors which are \nallocated lower or no significance in the Curraghinalt exploration model.  \n \nIn addition to delineating areas potentially favourable for gold mineralisation the \nprospectivity mapping has provided some new insight into possible regional controls on the \nlocation of mineralisation and into the geology of this area: \n \n1. Westward extension of the Curraghinalt lateral ramp: the series of prospective areas \nextending from the eastern end of the Newtownstewart Basin, through Golan Burn and \nCurraghinalt, and continuing eastwards over the Omagh Thrust, falls on a linear west-\nnorth-west trend. These prospective areas coincide with the major east-west-trending fault \nbounding the southern side of the Newtownstewart Basin and its projected extension \neastwards. This is consistent with the work of Earls et al.26 who identify this zone as an \nimportant target. A second series of prospective areas occurs to the north of the Omagh-\nKesh Basin, also orientated west-north-west, passing through Rylagh Burn and a second \narea of very high prospectivity (J). These linear prospective areas may be related to major \nstructural boundaries, which could represent important zones of fluid flow. A postulated \nwestward extension of the Curraghinalt lateral ramp, generally regarded as a critical \ncontrol on the location of the mineralisation at Curraghinalt, would coincide with these \nareas. Accordingly the fault bounding the southern side of the Newtownstewart Basin \ncould be related to the northern boundary of the ramp structure with the southern boundary \n25\u00a0\n\u00a0\nobscured by the Omagh-Kesh Basin. If these prospective zones are associated with the \nCurraghinalt Ramp then its extent or influence may extend further south than previously \nconsidered.  The fault bounding the southern side of the Newtownstewart Basin is deemed \nhighly prospective given the distribution of prospectivity and its extension into the \nCurraghinalt area (Fig. 5). \n \n2. Extent of the prospective Glengawna Formation: a further consideration relates to the \nmapping of the Dalradian in the \u2018Lack - Curraghinalt zone\u2019. The Dalradian rocks \nassociated with the two targets to the north of the Lack Inlier (H, I) are mapped as \nMullaghcarn Formation and no Glengawana Formation has been formally recognised (Fig. \n1).27  There are, however, definable packages of graphitic semipelite and pelite at various \nlevels within the Lack Inlier, which are considered to indicate the presence of Glengawna \nFormation.15  An extension of the Glengawna Formation into the Lack Inlier would \ncoincide with these two important targets. This is significant as proximity to the \nGlengawna Formation is suggested to play a role in the location of mineralisation. \n \n3. Prospectivity of the Sperrin Fold zone: fold crests are widely recognised as sites of space \ncreation and mineralisation.39,60 Our analysis has identified two prospective areas proximal \nto the hinge zone of the Sperrin Nappe. In addition this fold zone coincides with the \nprojected trace of the Omagh Lineament, a potentially important locus for fluid flow. \n \n4. The relationship between volcanic-hosted gold mineralisation and Dalradian-hosted gold: \nthe gold mineralisation at Crosh coincides with the eastern side of the prospective trend \nlocated to the north of the Omagh-Kesh Basin. The mineralisation is volcanic-hosted but is \nsituated in close proximity to the Omagh Thrust and the Mullaghcarn Formation. Given \nthe importance of the footwall ramp in the mineralisation process it is not implausible to \nenvisage movement of Caledonian mineralising fluids through the TIC.  \n \nCONCLUSIONS  \n \nRegional scale prospectivity analysis over the Sperrin Mountains of Northern Ireland using a \nfuzzy logic approach and integrating new data from the Tellus geochemical and geophysical \nsurveys has identified several areas prospective for vein-hosted gold mineralisation. Many of \nthese either coincide with known occurrences of gold mineralisation or with areas considered \nprospective based on previous work e.g. Earls et al.26, validating the process and model \nresults. Those areas of high prospectivity in which there are no known gold occurrences are \nconsidered to be favourable targets for further exploration. A number of these are located \noutside the main \u2018Lack \u2013 Curraghinalt zone\u2019 and should be followed up. \n \nThe use of separate models for the Curraghinalt and Cavanacaw deposits in our analysis was \nbased upon their distinct geochemical and structural features. However, a close correlation is \nobserved between the main targets generated by the two models. It is not possible to conclude \nif one model is generally superior to the other for exploration in the Sperrin Mountains. We \nsuggest that continued refinement of both models, using higher resolution datasets wherever \npossible, is the preferred way ahead. The incorporation of additional criteria relevant to the \nmineralisation into the modelling, supported by appropriate datasets, will in general improve \nthe reliability of the results. The fuzzy logic approach has proved to be a flexible technique \nfor testing the importance and relevance of different datasets to gold exploration in Northern \nIreland, whilst incorporating expert knowledge of the deposits.  \n \n26\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe results of the modelling suggest the exploration criteria have been successfully translated \ninto the model and similar criteria could be used for prospectivity analysis in similar terranes \nelsewhere. The approach described for Northern Ireland could be applied to the Scottish \nDalradian but without modern, high resolution airborne geophysical data it would not be \npossible to resolve the levels of structural detail attained from the Tellus survey. \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nWe acknowledge the support of Geological Survey of Northern Ireland and the Tellus project \nteam.
