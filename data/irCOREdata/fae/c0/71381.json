INTRODUCTION\nOne of the phenomena where hysteresis appears is in\nfriction. Friction is a nonlinear phenomenon occurring\nalmost in all mechanical systems exhibiting hysteretic\nbehavior. Different friction regimes can be distinguished\n\u2013 presliding region for movements over short distances\n(a few micrometers) in which the adhesive forces are\ndominant such that the friction force appears to be a\nhysteresis function of the displacement and a sliding\nregion, for larger movements in which the friction force\ndepends on the velocity. Different methods for modeling\nthis phenomenon and identifying its characteristics are\nproposed, starting with classical descriptions between\nvelocity and friction force (differential equations, static\nmaps) which can not adequately describe the presliding\nregion to the more complex LuGre [1,2] and Leuven [9]\nmodels. Those last two models are capable to describe\nboth regions. The Leuven model [9] implements also the\nnonlocal memory hysteresis characteristic which is not\nthe case for the LuGre model.\nThis paper considers only the presliding region. It\ninvestigates the identification of static hysteresis fun-\nctions with nonlocal memory, i.e. functions for which\n                                                          \n\u2217\n On leave from  the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences\nthe future output value depends both on the current\noutput value, and past extremums of the input. The term\nstatic indicates that the speed of the input variations  has\nno influence on the shape of the hysteresis curve.  The\nidentification is performed by a multiple model (MM)\napproach (with the Interacting Multiple Model (IMM)\nestimator). The MM approach has recently proven to be\npowerful to solve problems with uncertainties (structural\nand parametric), abrupt changes in the system behavior,\nin decomposing a complex problem into simpler sub-\nproblems in various areas as target tracking [6], fault\ndetection [8, 10] and identification [6, 7]. Using this\napproach the hysteresis function, characterized by a\nstrong nonlinearity (switching function), can be de-\ncoupled into a set of linear functions yielding a linear\ndescription of the nonlinear phenomenon. The IMM\nestimator uses the model derived in [4, 5] which\ndescribes the hysteresis as a parallel structure of\nelementary models. The developed method can be used\nto identify each hysteresis function.\nII.

Each elementary model can be considered as an\nelasto-slide element consisting of a massless block\nsubject to a Coulomb friction connected to a massless\nlinear spring (See Fig. 3). The parameter iW  represents\nthe Coulomb friction and the coefficient iK  characteri-\nzes the spring constant. Another characteristic parameter\nof the elementary model which can be used is\ni\u2206 = ii KW \/ , Ni ,...,2,1= , corresponding to the defor-\nmation of the spring when the spring force equals the\nCoulomb friction force. The deformation of the spring is\nthe difference of the input displacement ( )ku  and the\nposition ( )ki\u03b6  of the element. When the spring force is\nlarger than the Coulomb friction force, the element\nbegins to slide. Each block of an elementary model can\nremain in the same position called sticking (case 1), or\ncan undergo a change of the position, called slipping\n(case 2 and 3).

The uncertainty interval of the spring\nconstants, miniK ,[ , ],maxiK  can be determined by\nlooking to the minimal and maximal slopes of the\nmeasured hysteresis function.

The hysteresis behavior\nresulting from this augmented model is now approxi-\nmated with a reduced order augmented model consisting\nof seven elementary models. Preliminary the uncertainty\nintervals for the parameters are determined, i.e.\n]1,0(\u2208i\u2206  and ]4.0,1.0[\u2208iK .With each elementary mo-\ndel a separate IMM estimator is implemented with the\nsame transition probability matrix, mode probabilities,\ninitial conditions for the state estimates (random,\nuniformly distributed) and noise covariances as in the\nfirst experiment. The grid for i\u2206  is : gridi,\u2206 ={0.03, 0.1,\n0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1} and for all spring constants: gridiK ,\n={0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4}. Compared to the exact values,\nthree grid values of i\u2206  coincide with their exact values,\nthe others are not the same, but are within the un-\ncertainty interval. Also some grid values of iK  coincide\nwith the exact ones, but the most of them - not.

COMPARISON WITH THE RLSM\nAnother possible solution for hysteresis function identi-\nfication is developed in [5] using the recursive least-\nsquares method (RLSM). Results with high estimation\naccuracy are presented. The results obtained by the\nIMM estimator have a comparable accuracy of those\nfrom the RLSM. The RLSM requires an additional\nadaptation of the forgetting factor in the presence of\nchanges in the model parameters, whereas the IMM\napproach possesses an inherent mechanism to reflect\nquickly the changes. The parallel structure of the model\nwith three different cases and the IMM estimator give\nthe possibility to model and identify hysteresis func-\ntions, characterized with a hard nonlinearity as swit-\nching. The IMM probabilities provide for each ele-\nmentary model information about sticking and slipping\nbehavior, that information is not available in the RLSM\nparameter estimates. In comparison with the results\nreceived by the RLSM [5], it is not possible to obtain\nnegative values of the estimated parameters due to the\nfact that the probabilities can only have a positive sign.\nThe IMM implementation does not require considerable\ncomputations.  In every moment only one of the cases of\nthe elementary model is active. For N  parallel elemen-\ntary models and a grid with q values for iK , the number\nof active Kalman filters at each moment is Nq . Advan-\ntage of the RLSM is that it works almost without initial\ninformation, whereas for the IMM the transition\nprobability matrix should be preset. But the transition\nprobabilities are chosen to correspond to the fact that\none value of the spring coefficient is the most probable\nand this simplifies its determination. The crucial point of\neach MM estimator is the grid construction of the\nuncertain parameters. The true parameter values have to\nbe within the preset uncertainty intervals.\nVI. CONCLUSIONS\nThis work presents a solution for static hysteresis func-\ntion identification with a multiple model approach. The\nhysteresis function is described by a set of elementary\nmodels connected in parallel. This parallel structure of\nthe model, in combination with the IMM estimator gives\nthe possibility to reduce the nonlinear identification\nproblem to a linear one. For the parameters (the spring\nconstant and the force coefficient) of each elementary\nmodel, grids of possible values are preset taking into\naccount physical restrictions. With each elementary\nmodel a separate IMM estimator is synthesized working\nby linear Kalman filters based on models with different\nparameters. The final estimate of each parameter\nrepresents a fusion of the values from the grid weighted\nby the IMM mode probabilities. The estimated output of\neach elementary model is a fusion of the weighted\nestimates of the Kalman filters by the probabilities, and\nthe total hysteresis force represents the sum of the\nestimated outputs of all elementary models. A compari-\nson with the recursive least-squares method is discussed.\nResults from simulation experiments with one and more\nelementary models are presented.\nAcknowledgments\nH.
