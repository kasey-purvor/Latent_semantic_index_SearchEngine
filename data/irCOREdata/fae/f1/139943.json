Introduction\nThe resonance method for bulk piezoceramic characterization in the linear range is a \ncommonly used technique developed long time ago and for which numerous Standars \nhas been issued1,2. This method allows to determine a number of material coefficients \nfrom the measurement of the frequency dependence of the complex impedance at the \nelectromechanical resonance modes of ferro-piezoelectric ceramics with given \ngeometries. Iterative3,4 and fitting methods of analysis of the impedance spectra have \nbeen developed to provide and alternative to the limitations of the Standard \ncalculation methods concerning the characterization of high loss and low sensitivity \nferro-piezoelectric ceramic materials. \nIn the automatic iterative method developed at ICMM-CSIC the material data is \ndetermined by solving a set of non-linear equations that results when experimental \nimpedance data at a number of frequencies are introduced into the appropriate \nanalytical expression of the wave equation for a given electromechanical resonance \nmode. This set of equations is established for as many frequencies, which are \nautomatically selected by the program, as unknown coefficients. Solution is carried \nout by an iterative numerical method3,4.\nManuscript (NOT A PDF FILE AT REVISE STAGE)\nClick here to download Manuscript (NOT A PDF FILE AT REVISE STAGE): paperPIEZO2009Cantilevers_V1.doc\n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nSuch analytical expression are valid for sample geometries with given aspect ratios, \nwhich allows exciting uncopled modes. Regular sample geometries are recommended \nfor the use of this characterization method and extreme care shall be taken to \ndetermine accurately the dimensions and density of the samples, required for the \naccurate determination of the complex material parameters.\nIt is worth noting that four resonance modes, that can be measured using three sample \nshapes (thickness-poled thin disk, thickness-poled shear plate and long rod or bar), are \nenough to get the full set of independent parameters (2 dielectric (\uf065S11 and \uf065S33 ), 3 \npiezoelectric (d33 d31 and d15)and 5 elastic (s\nE\n11, s\nE\n12, s\nE\n33, s\nE\n13, s\nE\n44)) that characterizes \na ferro-piezoelectric poled ceramic material (6mm symmetry). Iterative methods were \ndeveloped for all these resonance modes, which allowed a consistent and accurate \nmatrix characterization of this type of materials5.\nSince most of the ferro-piezoceramic thin and thick films also have such 6mm \nsymmetry, in principle this method can be extended also to the film characterization. \nHowever, in fact they are not applicable to thin films deposited on thick substrates \nbecause the measured properties, such as the resonant frequency, are usually \ndominated by the presence of the thick substrate and their analytical treatment is not \nstraightforward6. This work presents a preliminary study for the application of \nAlemany et al. automatic iterative method3,4 to the determination, from complex \nimpedance measurements, of thick and thin film properties, using a conventional self-\nsupported bending cantilever design used in MEMS applications and fabricated from \na PZT film on Si substrate6. \n2. Experimental\n2.1.Self-supporting Piezoelectric Cantilevers from Thick Films\nThe substrate for the fabrication of the freestanding Pb1.2(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3 cantilevers \nwas a 350 \u00b5m thick double side polished <100> silicon (Si) wafer, with surface oxide \n(SiO2) of 200 nm thickness.  The initial processing step was to prepare the wafer for \nthe growth of the piezoelectric layer, this involved the prevention of lead diffusion \ninto the Si wafer through the bottom electrode, which can form a liquid phase lead \nsilicate at the annealing temperatures used for the piezoelectric (~720\u00b0C), with the use \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nof a 60 nm thick zirconium oxide layer (ZrO2).  The ZrO2 was deposited with a sol-\ngel method where a solution is prepared from 47 ml of ethanol anhydrite at 99.9%, \n3ml acetic acid and 4.344 g of zirconium propoxide, all of which are measured under \nan N2 ambient atmosphere.  The chemicals were then combined and stirred for 60 \nminutes.  The three layers of ZrO2 each of which were dried at 200\u00baC and pyrolised at \n350\u00baC, before subsequent crystallisation of the complete ZrO2 layer was performed in \na rapid thermal annealer (RTA) at 800\u02daC.  The wafer was platinised using sputtering \nin a Nordiko RF\/DC sputtering machine, 8 nm of RF sputtered Ti was used as an \nadhesion layer for the 100 nm thick DC sputtered Pt to act as a the bottom electrode.\nThe thick film lead zirconate titanate (PZT) is composed of a composite slurry \ncontaining Ferroperm PZ26 PZT powder mixed with PZT sol to create the bulk of the \nPZT layer, which due to its high porosity is infiltrated with a PZT sol diluted with 2-\nMethoxy-Ethanol with a 1:1 ratio to increase densification to 7,07 g\/cm3.  The process \nto deposit a complete layer of PZT uses two depositions of the PZT slurry, with 4 four \nsol infiltration steps giving a \u2018layer\u2019 thickness of 3.4 \u03bcm.  Each component of the \n\u2018layer\u2019 of the PZT slurry and sol infiltration is deposited onto the substrate in a cyclic \nprocess which includes drying at 200\u02daC and Pyrolosis 450\u02daC of the PZT film to \nprovide the required total thickness in our case around 10 \u00b5m, prior to sintering in a \nbox furnace at 720\u02daC.  A lift-off lithography process incorporating LOR2A and S1818 \nresists was used to deposit a patterned top electrode with the same parameters as the \nbottom electrode.  Following the deposition of the top electrode and subsequent lift \noff, the wafer was RF sputter coated with a blanket layer of gold 200 nm thick, a 2.5 \n\u00b5m thick resist mask was patterned upon the gold layer using the image reversal resist \nAZ5214E to provide a mould.  1 \u00b5m of nickel was then electroplated into the resist \nmould which was then stripped giving a hard metal mask for the deep reactive ion \netching (DRIE) of the PZT film7  After the etch of the PZT, the hard mask was \nremoved by wet etching the nickel in ferric chloride, and removing the gold in \npotassium iodide and iodine.  The wafer was then patterned using AZ4562 resist to \nRIE etch the bottom electrode and the surface oxide with Ar and CHF3, O2 gasses \nrespectively.  After this the wafer was patterned on the back face using the same \nimage reversal technique as the front to allow the sputter deposition and subsequent \nlift off of a 100 nm thick aluminium layer which acts as the hard mask for DRIE \nthrough the Si wafer to release the dies.  The final step is the O2 ashing of the \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nprotective resist on the front of the wafer and chemical cleaning using acetone and \nisopropanol alcohol. The devices obtained for this study are shown in Figure 1. \n2.2. Impedance measurements\nA special measurement cell was fabricated for the purpose of accurate connection to \nthe conducting paths of the devices and testing under reduced pressure conditions \n(below 1bar) the evolution of the resonance spectra (Figure 2). Measurements were \ncarried out using an HP4192A LF impedance analyser.\nThe first fact to take into account for this measurements is that the measuring voltage \nmust be fixed so as to stablish a linear range. Figure 3 shows the evolution of the \nmeasured resistance and impedance for the L26 device as a function of the voltage \napplied to the sample. Asymmetric peaks are found for 50mV or higher. Such an \neffect is well know as to be due to non-linear behaviour and has also been observed in \nceramics under 50 V of excitation8.  \nThe second fact that must be considered is the ocurrence of coupling between \nresonance modes, since the method under study is only valid for single modes. Figure \n4 shows the resistance, R, and conductance, G, at the resonances of devices L10 and \nL26. Whereas the spectrum for L10 shows three peaks, corresponding to three modes \nof vibration, the L26 device shows an uncoupled unique mode of resonance.\n2.3 Analysis of modes of resonance and principles for the calculation\nThe identification of the mode of movement of the resonance to be used for the \nparameters calculation is a crucial issue for the validity of the method.To determine \nthe mode of motion FEA simulation of the cantilevers was made using ATILA \nsoftware (9) and a three-dimentional harmonic analysis. Due to the symmetry of the \nsystem, only one half of the device was modelled to reduce the calculation time. \nBending motion of L28 was found at 775 Hz, whereas a pure length extensional mode \nwas found at 292 kHz and a coupled torsional movement and wavy length extensional \nmode was found at 325 kHz. Similar behaviour was found for L10, at higher \nfrequencies since the cantilever length is lower (Figure 4(a)). Such modes of \nresonance are very close in frequency and coupling can be expected, thus are not \noptimum for the calculation of the film parameters by the method here studied. \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nBending motion of L26 was found at 2260Hz, whereas at 488 kHz a pure length \nextensional mode is found. Thus the resonace R and G peaks shown in Figure 4(b) are \nidentified as the lenght extensional mode of the cantilever L26.\nAlemany et al. developed an automatic iterative method for piezoceramic \ncharacterization that provides the values of \uf065T33 , sE11 and d31, as well as the \nelectromechanical coupling factor k31, from the impedance measurements at the length \nextensional mode of a thickness poled long bar3, which can be used for the purpose of \ncharacterization from the mode shown in Figure 4(b). For the thickness poled \ncantilever (\uf06c\/4 wave resonator) we have a lenth extensional mode of motion with a \nnode at one edge, where the cantilever is fixed to the substrate, and maximum \namplitude at the other edge. The distribution of strain in the cantilever was obtained \nby FEA and it is shown in Figure 5(a). A thickness poled bar of double lenght and \ndouble capacitance of the cantilever ones will have a node at the center and maximum \namplitudes at both ends (\uf06c\/2 wave resonator), as FEA results in Figure 5(b) shows. \nBoth resonators share contour conditions and the analytical expression and resonance \nfrequency is the same for both. Making appropriated geometric corrections it is \npossible to calculate the material parameters of the cantilever for the mentioned mode \nusing the software of the Alemany method for the length extensional resonance of \nthickness poled bar.\n3. Results and discussion\nThe above mentioned calculation was made for the L26 device from the \nmeasurements at the verge of the linear range, 10 mV input signal, determined after \nmeasurements in the range of 5 to 100mV (Figure 3). The results of the calculated \nparameters and the coupling factor, k 31 , are shown in Table I. The regresion factor, \nR2, of the reconstructed spectra using the calculated parameters to the experimental \none is high, indicating that the calculus is accurate. However, the high value of \uf06533T\nobtained indicates that admittance data are overstimated. In fact, the capacitance \nmeasured below the conducting paths, which are needed to conect the cantilever to the \nmeasuring equipment, has a value of the same order of  the capacitance of the \ncantilever. Therefore, the measured admittance needs a correction arising from this \nstray capacitance in parallel with the cantilever. This stray capacitance was calculated \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nfrom the total value measured and the ratio between the area of the conducting paths \nto that of the total electroded area of the device. After this correction is made, \nconsidering negligible the resitance of the conducting paths, in addition to find a \nlower value of \uf06533T at resonance, we found that the coupling factor increases. The \nelastic coefficient remains unchanged after the data correction\nConclusions\nThe feasibility of the use of the resonance method for the calculation of the dielectric, \nelastic and piezoelectric complex parameters, as well as coupling coefficients of self-\nsupporting thin or thick films has been shown. Alemany et al. iterative method for the \nlength extensional resonance mode of thin bars, thickness poled and excited, provide a \nway of calculation of complex film parameters \uf065T33 , sE11 and d31, as well as the \nelectromechanical coupling factor k31, from the resonance of a self-supported thick \nfilm cantilevers.\nSpecial care must be taken in the complex admittance measurements concerning the \nlinearity regime of the measurement and the residual capacitance of the connecting \npads, which influences both the dielectric and piezoelectric properties determination. \nWork is under progress to asses the best poling conditions, loading effects of the top \nelectrodes and effect of reduced pressure atmosphere for the accurate determination of \nthe material parameters of thin and thick films. \nAcknowledgements\nThanks are given to Multifunctional and Integrated Piezoelectric Devices (MIND) \nNetwork of Excellence (FP6 515757-2 CE contract) for funding this work. \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nReferences\n(1) \u201cIEEE Standard on piezoelectricity\u201d.
