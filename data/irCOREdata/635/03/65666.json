This could indicate that \nsome aspects of processing may be common to both streams and\/or that there may be \nsome interaction between the areas.\nNeurological patients with damage to their dorsal stream are impaired on spatial tasks \ninvolving judgements of relative position or lateral extent, such as the landmark task \n(Harvey et al., 1995), but when asked to point to the middle of the screen or a shape, \nthey are unimpaired (Bartolomeo et al., 2003), perhaps by recruitment of their intact \nventral streams specialised for shape perception. A previous paper (Ellison & Cowey, \n2006) investigated this paradoxical dichotomy and discovered that there was a clear \ndissociation between the two streams when processing a shape task, with only right \nlateral occipital (LO) cortex being involved but not right posterior parietal cortex \n(PPC). However, counter-intuitively, both right LO and PPC were involved in the \nprocessing of a visuospatial task concerning the relative position of items in the \nfrontal plane. This finding is explicable if shape-based processing contributes to how \nthe normal brain computes relative spatial distance. This is manifested by the finding \nof Bartolomeo et al. (2003) in which neurological patients with dorsolateral parietal \ndamage and classical left hemineglect also have deficits in processing line bisection or \nlandmark tasks but the ability to point to the middle of the screen or a shape is spared, \npresumably by making a discrimination based on shape rather than spatial extent and \nthereby recruiting their undamaged ventral stream. There is a possibility therefore that \n44\nthe dorsal and the ventral streams are processing the same task, but in different ways, \ni.e. PPC is basing its analysis on visuospatial properties, but LO is using shape \ninformation to complete the task. It is also possible however that the dorsal and \nventral streams are interacting in order to process the task, with LO providing shape \ninformation and PPC spatial information. Both of these hypotheses are consistent with \nthe behavioural effect of increased reaction times with TMS at either site. \nIf the relative timing of involvement of PPC and LO could be determined, the results \nshould help in deciding between these two possibilities. If LO and PPC are active in \nparallel and simultaneously, both areas would seem to be processing the task \naccording to their relative functional specialization, be it shape or space. If \nconsecutive peaks of activation are seen, it is more likely that LO and PPC work in \nsequence in order to accomplish the task.\nThe same visuospatial distance task as was used in our previous study was used in the \npresent investigation, but with double pulse TMS to provide a brief disruption \nwindow of 100 ms, allowing us to make inferences as to when each area of \ninvestigation is most involved in processing the task.\nMethods\nSubjects\nTen healthy subjects, aged 19-26, with normal or corrected to normal vision (all right \nhanded; 6 female, 4 male), each participated in two experimental sessions. Subjects \ngave their signed informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki \nand with the approval of Durham University Ethics Advisory Committee, and could \n55\nleave the experiment at any time. Subject selection complied with current guidelines \nfor rTMS research (Wassermann, 1998). \nStimuli\nAll stimuli were presented on a 32 cm x 24 cm VDU driven by a Pentium-4 PC \nprogrammed in E-Prime (Psychology Software Tools, Inc). Subjects were seated \ncomfortably 57.5 cm away from the screen with the centre of the screen at eye level. \nThe subjects\u2019 head and trunk sagittal midline was aligned with the centre of the \nscreen, and head position was controlled by a chinrest. \nVisual Task\nThe distance discrimination task directly replicated that used by Ellison & Cowey \n(2006), in which subjects had to judge which of two eccentric and identical green (11 \ncd\/m2) squares (1\u00ba x 1\u00ba in size, 5\u00ba to the left of the vertical midline) in the left \nhemifield was closer to a third identical square at the fixation point. One square \n(either the top or the bottom) was always 3\u00ba above or below the horizontal midline. \nThe other square was initially presented at a vertical eccentricity of 4 degrees from the \nhorizontal meridian and progressively it approached it in 0.2\u00ba steps until the threshold \nfor 80% correct was reached according to the following rule. Difficulty was changed \nafter each set of five trials. After five consecutive correct responses difficulty was \nincreased by one step. If two or more incorrect responses out of five were made, the \ndifficulty was decreased by one step. Performance was deemed stable when \nperformance reached 80% correct (four out of five) in two subsequent sets.\nEvery trial began with a 500 ms central fixation cross (0.5\u00ba x 0.5\u00ba) after which the \nthree stimuli were presented for 500 ms, one of them replacing the fixation cross. The \n66\nbackground colour was a uniform grey with a luminance of 30 cd\/m2. There was a 5\nsecond interval between trials. The experimental value of the distance of the furthest \nobject from the centre was set at 0.2\u00ba greater than the threshold value. The subject was \nasked to indicate which item was closer to the item in the centre by pressing the \nbottom button on a keypad if the bottom item was closest and the top button if it was \nthe top item. The top square was the closer item in 50% of trials, at random. \nFIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE\nTMS\nA Magstim\u2122 Rapid Model was used to apply 2 pulses at 20Hz (50 ms apart) at 65% \nof the stimulator\u2019s maximum power (i.e. at 1.3 Tesla) using a 70 mm figure-of-eight \ncoil placed tangential to the skull, with the handle pointing backward, parallel to the \nhorizontal and the mid-sagittal plane and held in place throughout by the \nexperimenter. The magnetic intensity used is greater than the threshold intensity \nrequired to induce movement (over motor cortex) or the perception of phosphenes \n(over primary visual cortex, V1) in all of the subjects but did not produce phosphenes \nwhen delivered over LO or PPC. The TMS train of 2 pulses began at 8 onset times, \nnamely: 0, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, and 350 ms after the onset of the visual array.\nTwo sites of stimulation were used, as by Ellison & Cowey (2006), a right ventral \nstream site (LO) and a right dorsal stream site (PPC). The dorsal site was chosen as an \narea of posterior parietal cortex (PPC) known to be involved in difficult conjunction \nvisual search tasks that engage dorsal functions, and was identified by using a hunting \nprocedure with the hard conjunction task, as described in Ashbridge et al. (1997). The \nventral site was chosen in relation to area right V5 (generally corresponding to 3 cm \nabove the mastoid-inion and 5 cm lateral to the right) which was precisely identified \n77\nby localising the area where a train of TMS pulses (10 Hz, 500 ms) repeatedly elicited \nthe strongest and most salient moving phosphenes (see Schenk et al., 2005) at the \nlowest TMS intensity. The ventral site LO was then calculated to be 1-1.5 cm caudal \non the skull in a direct line towards the inion. This area corresponds well with lateral \noccipital cortex, LO (see figure 1).\nTrials were administered in six blocks of 40 trials (per task) each block randomised \nacross subjects to minimise either order or practice effects; four blocks with TMS \nover the experimental site (LO or PPC) on each trial, and two blocks of sham TMS \nwith a non-discharging coil held over the experimental site and a second coil \ndischarged a few cm above the skull on the subjects\u2019 right so that the subjective \nexperience of the noise associated with a TMS pulse was the same, as was the tactile \nexperience of the silent coil placed on the head. However, no effective pulse was \nadministered to the brain. Two testing sessions were required, one for each \nexperimental site (PPC or LO) and the order of sessions was the same for each session \nwithin subject but randomised across subjects. Each testing session usually lasted no \nmore than 1 hour. \n88\nResults\nThresholds:\nThe mean threshold achieved across subjects in the distance task was a difference of \n0.42 \uf0b1 0.10\u00ba for 80% correct. This led to a fixed distance of 0.62 \uf0b1 0.10\u00ba for the \nfurthest square in the experimental task. \nEffect of TMS:\nA two-factor repeated measures general linear model (GLM) comparing reaction \ntimes for sham and PPC stimulation over all time bins (TMS[PPC, sham] x TMStime[8 \nSOAs]) revealed a significant main effect of TMS (F(1, 9) = 9.056, p = 0.015) and a main \neffect of TMS time (F(7, 63) = 2.711, p = 0.016) with no interaction effect (F(7, 63) = \n1269.964, p = 0.779). As PPC and LO sites were tested in separate sessions, the same \nanalysis was performed for the LO TMS reaction times and the corresponding sham \nreaction times. This revealed a main effect for TMS (F(1, 9) = 14.078, p = 0.005) and \nTMS time (F(7, 63) = 7494.714, p < 0.001) but with no interaction (F(7, 63) = 1855.94, p \n= 0.363). \nSeparate one-factor repeated measures GLMs at each time point revealed that TMS \nhad a significant effect on reaction time when TMS was applied over PPC at 50+100 \nms (F(1, 9) = 5.230, p = 0.048), 250+300 ms (F(1, 9) = 6.018, p = 0.037), and 350+400 \nms (F(1, 9) = 13.214, p = 0.005). When TMS was applied over LO, reaction times were \nsignificantly increased over sham reaction times at 0+50 ms (F(1, 9) = 8.565, p = \n0.017), 50+100 (F(1, 9) = 10.556, p = 0.010), 100+150 (F(1, 9) = 24.463, p = 0.001), \n150+200 (F(1, 9) = 8.357, p = 0.018), 200+250 (F(1, 9) = 7.820, p = 0.021) and 350+400 \n(F(1, 9) = 10.409, p = 0.010).\n99\nFIGURE 2 ABOUT HERE\nPPC vs LO\nIn order to compare the effect of TMS at PPC and LO, TMS reaction times were \nnormalised with respect to each session\u2019s sham condition. Data were normalised \naccording to the formula (TMS-sham)\/sham, therefore positive values denote an \nincrease in reaction time with TMS at that particular SOA. A two-factor repeated-\nmeasures GLM (TMS[PPC, LO] x TMStime[8 SOAs]) was then performed using the \nnormalised effect of TMS at each SOA for each site. There was no main effect of \nTMS (F(1, 9) = 2.545. p = 0.145). However, there was a main effect for TMStime \n(F(7,63) = 4.766. p < 0.001) with no interactions (F(7,63) = 0.923. p = 0.495). This \npattern of significances suggests that although there is no overall difference in how \nTMS affect performance at each site, there is a difference in its effects in different \ntime bins. As visual information from the eye first reaches occipital cortex, including \narea V1, at about 40 ms after stimulus onset and subsequent feedback information \nreaches extra-striate visual areas at around 90-100 ms (reviewed by Corthout et al., \n2007) we would expect differences in activations between PPC and LO temporally \nearly in visual processing (as can be seen in Figure 2B). Therefore, we compared the \neffects of TMS delivered over LO and PPC at 50 and 100 ms.  There was a significant \ndifference between these sites when double pulses of TMS were applied at SOAs of \n50 ms (t = -2.677, df = 9, p = 0.025) and 100 ms ((t = -2.861, df = 9, p = 0.019).\nThere was no reason to expect any difference at other SOAs and indeed there were \nnone.   \n10\n10\nDiscussion:\nThe results confirm the finding of Ellison & Cowey (2006), that rTMS of right PPC \nand LO increases reaction time in a task requiring visuospatial discrimination of \nrelative distance. The current experiment, however, sought to determine the temporal \npattern of activation of right PPC and right LO in the processing of this task. There \nwas no overall difference in how TMS impaired reaction times between PPC and LO \nbut  the TMS effect differed across stimulation times with significant differences \nwhen double pulses were applied at 50 ms and 100 ms. At both of these times TMS at \nLO had a significantly greater effect. PPC stimulation and LO stimulation also \ninduced a similar and large increase in response latency at the later time point of 350 \nms. These later impairments have not been explored.\nThese findings indicate that the ventral stream has a greater earlier involvement in the \nprocessing of this task, consistent with our previous conclusion that the involvement \nof LO in this task is based on the shape processing for which the ventral stream is \nspecialized (Kourtzi & Kanwisher, 2001; Malach et al., 1995). In contrast the \ninvolvement of the dorsal stream is based on its established visuo-spatial \nspecialisation (Avidan et al., 2003; Ellison et al., 2003; Bjoertomt et al., 2002). \nCorthout et al., (2007) have recently delineated the arrival time of visual information \nin extra-striate visual cortex, whether feed-forward or feed-back, as between 50 and \n100ms. This finding is supported by our results which show that although the \ninvolvement of the ventral and dorsal streams largely mirror each other, LO has a \nsignificantly more crucial role in early processing of visual information in our task.  \nThis is also in line with fMRI and ERP evidence that show the relative activation of \n11\n11\nthese regions within this timescale (Vanni et al., 2004;  Jiang & Han, 2005). However, \nit remains possible that the dorsal stream depends upon input from the ventral stream \nin order to adequately process the task, and that is why disruption of either area \nlengthens reaction time. A necessary interaction between the streams for the \ncompletion of this task will also explain why parietal patients cannot usually carry out \nsuch visuospatial tasks using their intact ventral streams alone (e.g. Harvey et al., \n1995). \nThe much later, and unexpected, peaks of disruption when TMS is applied at 350 ms \nafter visual stimulus onset may point to the activity of other reciprocal interactions. \nAlthough a model for such an interaction, mediated by V1, does exist (Deco & Lee, \n2004), further work must be carried out to determine the functional specificity and \ntiming of such associations and the nature of their connections. It is also possible that \nmagnetically induced stimulation of both LO and PPC are impeding, and therefore \nslowing down, preparation for a motor response. The role of the dorsal stream in \nvisuomotor transformations is clear from neuropsychological (James et al., 2003), \nfunctional imaging (Culham et al., 2006) and TMS (Ellison et al., 2003) studies. But \nthis alone does not explain the involvement of PPC in the visuospatial task used in \nthis study as PPC was not involved in a shape discrimination where the same \nvisuomotor transformation was required in our previous paper (Ellison & Cowey \n2006).  However, it is even less clear why disruption of the ventral stream should \nlengthen a motor response. With respect to area V5, Schenk et al (2005) found that \nmagnetic stimulation here can lengthen the execution of the action of catching a \nmoving object. In contrast, a combined neuropsychological and fMRI study by James \net al. (2003) shows a clear dichotomy between the ventral and dorsal streams for \nobject recognition and object directed grasping. Nevertheless, in normal human \n12\n12\nsubjects a much more integrative approach may be involved in processing tasks like \nthe present one, in which reciprocal interactions which involve earlier perceptual \nprocesses may be concerned either with perceptual issues or response issues in the \ntask. This important matter has yet to be addressed. \n13\n13\nReferences\nAshbridge, E., Walsh, V., Cowey, A. (1997). Temporal aspects of visual search \nstudied by transcranial magnetic stimulation.

Each SOA represents the time of the first pulse, with the second \npulse 50 ms later. * indicates that the difference between the effects of TMS over LO \nand PPC is significant to the p < 0.05 level, **, significant to the p < 0.01 level.  It \nshould be noted that the effect of TMS at both sites was greatest at 350 ms, but there \nwas no difference between the effect seen at LO and PPC.\nFigure1\nClick here to download high resolution image\nFigure2\nClick here to download high resolution image\n"}
