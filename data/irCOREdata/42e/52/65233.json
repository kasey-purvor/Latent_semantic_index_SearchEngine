Drawing on texts from the period and\nreflective discussions twenty years later with women associated with the strike, it\ninterrogates the ways in which the idea of community was used to accommodate the\nactivism of women. We argue that the apparently gender-neutral ideal of mining\ncommunity carried meanings that had ambiguous political implications for the women\nand that the strike highlighted paradoxes that question established understanding of\nfemale strike activism.\nIntroduction\nThe 1984\u20131985 British coal miners\u2019 strike was fought and lost during a bitter\none-year struggle by the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) in which\nwomen united with men in opposition to the National Coal Board (NCB) and\nMargaret Thatcher\u2019s Conservative Government. The dispute followed a govern-\nment report recommending a 10 percent cut in capacity, involving the closure of\ntwenty pits and the loss of twenty thousand jobs.2 There had already been a sig-\nnificant decline in mining, with 505 of 822 pits closed and the labor force \u201calmost\nhalved\u201d3 between 1957 and 1968, but the miners had emerged victorious from\ntwo strikes in 1972 and 1974. The 1974 victory had resulted in the collapse of\na Conservative Government and it is widely believed that the 1984 strike was\nprovoked partly in revenge for that defeat.4\nBy the mid-1970s the miners had reasserted their iconic status within the\nlabor movement. In the context of oil crises at the end of that decade a strong\ncase was made for continued investment in coal.5 However in 1979,\nThatcher\u2019s radical Conservative Government was elected on a wave of anti-\nunion sentiment. In 1983, Ian MacGregor, who had previously been involved\nin cutting the labor force in British Leyland and British Steel, was appointed\nNCB Chairman. There followed an intransigent assault on \u201cuneconomic\u201d\npits.6 Previously the NUM and the NCB had engaged in a negotiated approach\nto pit closures, but there was no consultation about the proposal to accelerate\nthe closure program in 1984.7 The resulting national strike, which began in\nInternational Labor and Working-Class History\nNo. 75, Spring 2009, pp. 68\u201384\n# 2009 International Labor and Working-Class History, Inc.\nMarch 1984, was mainly about the assault on jobs in localities that offered little\nalternative, comparable employment. As such, it encompassed concern for the\nfutures of families and local communities dependent on mining.\nThe rhetoric from both sides of the dispute revealed the depth of political\nantagonism. Thatcher described the miners as \u201cthe enemy within,\u201d8 threatening\nher ideal of community of nation. For miners, the strike was defending local\nworking-class communities and culture against the threat of the imposition of\nsuch a national community. On hearing of the appointment of MacGregor,\nJohn Cummings, the Labour MP for Easington, said, \u201cHe wants to take away\nour independence and our cultural heritage, our village life and our club life.\nAll this is our heritage, and I\u2019m not prepared to let him take my heritage\naway from me.\u201d9\nThis article considers the appeal to community within the strike with par-\nticular reference to the role of activist women. It has been informed by\ntextual evidence and draws on the recollections of women who were involved.\nTen women from the North East Coalfield were interviewed between 2002\nand 2004.10 A two-hour recorded discussion among twenty women from the\nNorth East and Staffordshire, attending a commemorative conference at\nNorthumbria University in July 2004, provided extra source material.11\nFinally a group of six women, involved in self-help activity in an ex-mining\nvillage in County Durham, three of whom had participated in the strike, partici-\npated in a collective interview in 2004.12\nMining and Community\nThe idea of community in relation to mining seems self-evident.\nInterdependence among work, family, and locality in the nineteenth and early\ntwentieth century created conditions for tight networks, affective ties, and reci-\nprocal relationships in local settlements. Families migrated in community groups\nfollowing new pits or better conditions. Group solidarity was an important\nprotection against hostile physical conditions and conflictual employment\nrelations.13 Because \u201cmining community\u201d does not generally seem problematic,\nthe notion of community has often been explained simply with reference to the\ncentrality of the pit and the nature of male work:\nTo outsiders, mining communities are still objects of legend, mystery and even awe.\nIt is not so much that pit villages are geographically isolated but rather that the pit,\nand the type of work done there dominates lives in a way that few other jobs do.\nMining is always uncomfortable and dangerous, and the nature of the work binds\nmen together. . .14\nMost accounts of British mining life15 emphasize the strength and importance of\ncommunity as a self-contained way of life deriving from particular industrial\nconditions. These accounts demonstrate relationships of work, family, and\nneighborhood radiating from the mine, sustaining a local culture in which\n\u201cSide by Side With Our Men?\u201d 69\n\u201ccommunity\u201d turns back toward the mine in a symbiotic, sustaining duality. The\nmale world of the mine was the beating, economic heart of local community\nupon which female life was dependent. Female \u201ccommunity work\u201d was\ndeployed to sustain the affective, fluid relationships between work, local neigh-\nborhood, and family, while male \u201ccommunity work\u201d focused upon the formality\nof systems and the management of welfare organizations, institutes, and clubs\noften linked to the NUM and thence to the national and international labor\nmovement. The rhythms, structures, and processes of mining defined the every-\nday worlds and the personal and political identities of miners and their families.\nHigh levels of loyalty and support from kith and kin were needed to sustain the\nmining economy in which male workers were preeminent. As coal mining\nbecame more settled, these conditions encouraged a strong commitment to\nlocal place focused upon a particular pit.16 This was intensified by the physical\nisolation of many mining villages developed exclusively in response to the\nsinking of a pit. Commitment to a particular community of place was symbolized\nin the lodge banner, which expressed the values and politics of the men and\nfamilies through the union.17\nThe strong relationship between community and place has attracted a par-\nticular \u201ccommunity studies\u201d type of approach to understanding mining life and\nrelationships.18 Historical and sociological analyses that adopt this perspective,\ntypified in Dennis, et al.\u2019s classic study of a Yorkshire mining village, draw atten-\ntion to the self-contained relationship between locality, community, and iden-\ntity.19 Traditional gender relationships inscribed within a work-place-family\ntriad are explained in this model, but the gendered meaning of community\nitself is not interrogated. Female agency is simply assumed to remain mechanis-\ntically subject to men and their work.\nOne usually finds that marras20 down the pit are also marras outside. They will be\npersonal friends and go to the same places; their wives will probably become\nfriends and arrange the same times to go shopping or to the laundry or to take\nthe kids out.21\nWomen have not been ignored; indeed there has been deep respect for the level\nof responsibility that they have taken in family and community life.\nNevertheless, an overwhelmingly one-sided male perspective has been pre-\nsented in which the active female voice has been largely silent.22\nSuch interpretations rely upon classical sociological conceptions of histori-\ncal change which equate \u201ccommunity\u201d with the solidaristic relationships of pre-\nindustrial economies, characterized by small-scale, isolated settlements, low\nlevels of social mobility, a clear sexual division of labor, fixed social roles and\nstatus, and religiosity.23 Yet from this perspective, mining villages were paradox-\nical. On the one hand, the conditions of separateness, the self-sufficiency, and the\ninterdependent relationships characteristic of single-industry mining settle-\nments suggested pre-modern conditions, conservatism, and social rigidity. On\nthe other hand, because the social relations of mining were forged in industrial\n70 ILWCH, 75, Spring 2009\nand class conflict, they represented the possibilities of class cooperation and soli-\ndarity, which might be an example for a socialist future. There is therefore a sig-\nnificant tension within the idea of mining community: the conservatism of\nTo\u00a8nnies\u2019 notion of gemeinschaft is ever present within the progressive ideas\nabout communism established within the Marxist tradition.24 In the \u201cred\u201d\nmining villages of County Durham, bearing nicknames like \u201cLittle Moscow,\u201d\nthe solidaristic class relationships were prized as ideal communities upon\nwhich a progressive industrial future might be modelled.25 But such solidarities\nof class retained inequalities and exclusions. Gender inequality was subsumed\nwithin and subject to the class dimensions of mining community. Moreover,\ninsofar as women were responsible for sustaining the local, affective bonds of\nplace, they came to embody the political ambiguities: conservative qualities of\nmining community were located in the social space that they inhabited, while\nsocialist or communist associations were found in male organization.\nThe defeat of the 1984 strike, and the demise ofmining following the decision\nto close thirty-oneof the remainingfifty-one collieries in1992, inevitably resulted in\nsocial upheaval in ex-mining areas, as \u201clocal pride notwithstanding, traditional\nbonds of family and community life [were] stretched to breaking point.\u201d26 Class\nand gender assumptions were disturbed in the process, but the ideal of community\nremained intact in national policy to deal with the consequences. Communitarian\nprinciples especially informed the approach of the Labour Government elected in\n1997. In 1999, the Coalfields Regeneration Trust declared its aim to be \u201cchanging\nthe face of coalfield communities.\u201d27 In this context, a more critical understanding\nof \u201ccommunity\u201d and mining settlement has emerged. Significantly, the work of\nsociologists with reference to regeneration includes a more nuanced awareness\nof different gender perspectives and relationships, suggesting that the community\nactivism of women contains its own dynamic, which is important in efforts toward\nrebuilding community cohesion.28\nBefore 1984, the threat to mining intrinsically implied a threat to commu-\nnity in an undifferentiated sense. Yet there were always aspects of women\u2019s\nparticipation in social life that were not in themselves dependent upon\nmining. For example, women built their own organizations, such as the\nWomen\u2019s Co-operative Guild, and created social networks related to their\nown unpaid economic activity, such as mat-making, which were collective and\nhome-based but redolent of community nevertheless. Moreover, women partici-\npated and took formal roles in religious and political organizations.29 Despite\nmale domination in such organizations, some women learned formal skills\nthrough participation in committee structures and the management of local\nresources. In relation to local place, \u201ccommunity\u201d for women, just as much as\nfor men, had dimensions and relationships in which the private and the public\nwere interwoven and in which women exercised agency.\nIn abstract terms, the meaning of community is notoriously \u201cslippery.\u201d As\nBauman suggests, while community always seems to be \u201ca good thing,\u201d its inclusiv-\nity is only meaningful with reference to what it excludes.30 A place of security for\nthose who \u201cbelong\u201d and are \u201crecognized\u201d can be alien and unfriendly for those\n\u201cSide by Side With Our Men?\u201d 71\nwho donot conform to or identify with dominant socialmores. Community is often\nclosed to outside influence and possibilities for change. Even for thosewho belong,\nthe material realities of social change and power relations mean that the \u201cfeel\ngood\u201d promise of community is elusive in practice and uneven in distribution.\n\u201cCommunity as place\u201d is particularly prone to generalizations and toundiffer-\nentiated andmasculinist versions ofmining life. Other notions of community ques-\ntion this dominant understanding.31 For example, the ideas developed by\nAnderson relating to nationhood suggest that community is constructed through\ncultural processes by the imagination. Bauman takes the argument further,\narguing that community does not exist at all in any material sense while Plant\nsuggests that community can be fruitfully mobilized as a process, a set of relation-\nships and values that people self-consciously attempt to establish.32 Williams\nargued that the construction of community draws upon an idealization of the\npast, a place that always \u201chasbeen\u201d and forwhich nonegative connotations exist.33\nThese complications in meaning were all evident in references to mining\ncommunity in the 1984\u20131985 strike. Mining as community of place was associ-\nated with the mining villages that \u201chad been\u201d during the nineteenth and early\ntwentieth century. Meanwhile, engagement in strike activism drew upon politi-\ncal and historical imaginations to construct community with reference to the pol-\nitical ideals associated with socialism and working-class cooperation, which were\npitted against the political and historical imaginations of nationhood promoted\nby Thatcherism. Cooperative principles were made material to some extent in\nthe process of collective organization in support of the strike. However,\ncomplex considerations of insider-outsider status between miners, miners\u2019\nfamilies, and \u201cothers\u201d (friend or foe), meant that the promise of community\ncould never be fully achieved; the very dynamism of the strike generated aware-\nness of difference as much as commonality between those directly affected and\nsupporters from \u201coutside.\u201d34 The conflict associated with strike breakers,\nbranded as traitors to community as much as to worker solidarity, particularly\ndestabilized the assumption that community cohesion necessarily followed\nfrom the local conditions of work in the mine. Meanwhile, political alliances\nwith groups not normally associated with mining suggested dimensions to com-\nmunity that might be derived from values rather than lived experiences.\nDifferent subject positions occupied by men and women in this process raised\nserious questions about gender inequalities and assumptions associated with\ntraditional mining communities of place.\nWomen, Mining Community, and the Strike\nThe collaborative relationships established between men in the hostile con-\nditions of the pit undoubtedly had their counterpart in solidaristic relationships\nassociated with home and place. Such community relationships were not only\nderivative but had a material foundation. Mine owners were also landlords:\nemployer-owned housing for mining families was typically substandard.\nConflicts with mine owners as employers were mirrored in landlord-tenant\n72 ILWCH, 75, Spring 2009\ndisputes.35 Mass eviction often followed nineteenth-century strikes, and, well\ninto the twentieth century, landlord power was being used against union\nleaders.36 The immediate interests of women and children were therefore inter-\nwoven with labor relations while the provision of decent housing was a central\nconcern of the miners\u2019 union. The mutual gender struggle was particularly\nevident in the campaign for pithead baths which, when established, allowed\nmen to wash at work when they finished their shift, rather than after they\nreturned to homes without running water or bathroom facilities. This took a\nmassive burden off the women, who were responsible for preparing water and\nfilling the tin baths, helping the men to wash the grime from their bodies, and\nwashing their male relatives\u2019 filthy work clothes. Standing \u201cside by side with\ntheir men\u201d in class struggle was directly grounded in the conditions of female\nexistence although the emphasis in the benefits to be gained was different for\nmen and women.\nThe centrality of class in mining campaigns has had particular implications\nfor the gendered understanding of community. Excluded from underground\nmining since the Coal Mines Act of 1842, in many regions women were entirely\noutside the labor market and therefore perceived as secondary to the class\nstruggle as conceptualized within labor politics. Women\u2019s role could only be\nunderstood with reference to the conditions of labor in the mines. The interde-\npendent structural and material basis of the political struggles of women was\nobscured by the fact of their personal dependence upon the men.\nConsequently their independent voices have not been heard, and they have\nbeen caricatured as the most oppressed of creatures. \u201cEvery reference to\nminers\u2019 wives in regional writings on coal communities . . . comments on the\nhard labour of these \u2018semi-imprisoned\u2019 women.\u201d37\nYet female community activism had historically independent dimensions:\nWomen are very active in this village. Always have been . . . Have you ever noticed\n. . . when you are talking to a miners\u2019 group, it\u2019s the women who are talking, not\nthe men? The men went to work to get the pennies to bring back to the wives\nto sort out the problems.38\nThat there was always an independent aspect to the community orientation of\nwomen in mining life is obscured by the dominant narrative of the transforma-\ntive quality of the strike for women. This narrative suggests that the typical\nstrike activist was a miner\u2019s wife who, in solidarity with her man, left the dom-\nestic sphere to defend her family, community, and inherited \u201cway of life.\u201d\nThrough her actions, she underwent a metamorphosis from housewife to politi-\ncal activist, transformed by collective engagement with the men\u2019s struggle into a\nnew female working-class vanguard.39\nThe iconography of the strike supports this interpretation. As the strike\nprogressed, images of domesticated women serving in kitchens and observing\nmale actions were supplemented by pictures of women participating in mass\nrallies, conferences, and marches, carrying banners articulating their views;\n\u201cSide by Side With Our Men?\u201d 73\nshouting at strike-breakers; speaking on public platforms; and supporting other\nstruggles.40\nYet this narrative of \u201ctransformation\u201d relies on a partial understanding that\nprivileges a conservative view of the inherited gender relations of the mining\ncommunity. The extent to which the women responded to their own perceptions\nof the problems associated with mine closure, the extent to which they used\nalready existing political skill and knowledge, and the extent to which changes\nin gender roles and responsibilities prevalent in \u201cthe outside world\u201d had\nalready affected those involved in mining went unnoticed, and, instead, \u201carche-\ntypal images came into play, remembered traumas of the bad old days.\u201d41 The\ncomplexity of the relations between gender and community prior to 1984\nremained unacknowledged and unexplored.\nIn the absence of employment and child-care options, in the face of male\nshift work, it was inevitable that some women continued to occupy traditional\nroles up to and beyond the strike year. However, disruption to traditional pat-\nterns of life had occurred long before 1984. As the mining industry declined\nduring the 1960s, substitute industries offered mainly low-paid employment\nopportunities to women.42 Meanwhile, local links between family, neighborhood\nand work were broken for those displaced and dispersed by previous mine clo-\nsures.43 \u201cMining community\u201d was becoming both spatially and affectively less\ncohesive. There was a growing disjuncture between the historical presumptions\nupon which gender relations were based and the realities of family, place of\nresidence, and working life across different coalfields.\nBy 1984, mining community and mining village were no longer necessarily\nsynonymous. For example, in the Durham coalfield there had been a serious\ndecline in the small village structure with migration toward the larger mines on\nthe coast. Even in areas where mining continued to dominate, the physical\nboundaries of place had less relevance in the face of modern communication\nsystems, while expanded educational opportunities enabled some of the\nyounger postwar generation to leave mining altogether. Yet the frequent refer-\nences to \u201cmining village,\u201d usually in association with female action, in the dis-\ncourse of the strike suggested the continuing vibrancy of historically discrete,\nspatially isolated and bounded places in the imagination of the Left.44 Raphael\nSamuel reported that, \u201c. . . housing estates were talked of as though they were vil-\nlages, places of hereditary settlements where generations of miners had lived.\u201d45\nThat loss of mining would mean degradation to the conditions of local com-\nmunity was uncontroversial. Yet, objectively, the quality of local social con-\nditions and relations were not dependent upon mining, per se. Indeed, it\ncould be argued that if adequate economic investment were to follow, the phys-\nical quality of localities might improve with the closure of coal mines, and that\nthe relational qualities of locality associated with the female role might be har-\nnessed to good effect in a post-mining world. However, the premises for the\ndominant arguments of the Left were located in the past rather than in the\nreal conditions of the present or any imagined alternative future. In this\nsense, they contained their own brand of conservatism.\n74 ILWCH, 75, Spring 2009\nPredictions of community degradation were important in forging links\nbetween the NUM\u2019s concern for employment with broader political questions\nabout values and how to live. The imagery of collectivism and cooperation\nassociated with local mining communities of the past offered an alternative,\nworking-class vision to the radical individualism of the new conservative hege-\nmony. However, the appeal to the preservation of mining community legiti-\nmated and explained female activism in exclusive terms, invoking traditional\nroles, reasserting meanings whereby acting \u201cside by side\u201d with the men meant\nconforming to unequal gender relationships in a predetermined sexual division\nof labor. This was sometimes communicated directly by the NUM and individual\nmen who attempted to allocate \u201cappropriate\u201d tasks to the women:\nThe men came over . . . and Vera says, \u201cHow are the couples and single lads getting\non?\u201d He says, \u201cWhey that\u2019s up to you to find out! You\u2019re the women! Get on with\nit!\u201d46\nThe Sacriston Lodge members were traditional males\u2013\u2013they wanted their\nwomen to stay at home and they held very specific views about what women\ncould and couldn\u2019t do. Making sandwiches was fine; as long as we didn\u2019t ask to\ndo anything else, their equilibrium was intact. It was such a fight even to get\nonto the picket line.47\nSuch positioning neither accommodated the complex realities of the lives of\nwomen before the strike, nor acknowledged the independent political well-\nspring of their opposition to Thatcherism. Despite the efforts of women to par-\nticipate as socialist political actors in the strike, references to their traditional\nroles in community resituated them continuously in fundamentally conservative\npositions. Women had to deal with this in order to maintain cooperative\nrelations with the union. At the same time the complex and self-conscious\nnature of their activism transcended such stereotypes.48 In a dance of domina-\ntion and dependence, women activists thus found themselves performing differ-\nent subject positions for different audiences:\nThe women . . . were appealing on behalf of the working class . . . when they went\nto other towns and cities. But inside the coalfield they would appeal to people and\nsay \u201cit is nothing to do with the union. It\u2019s us. We are looking after families,\u201d\u2013\u2013the\nmost unpolitical message you could possibly get.49\nWhether or not they had any relationship with a miner was not the issue, but it\nwas primarily as \u201cus,\u201d as \u201cminers\u2019 wives,\u201d fighting for the virtues of traditional\nmining community that the women were accommodated by the NUM and\napplauded by the labor movement. Thus it was in these terms that they\nperformed.50\nRomantic notions about miners\u2019 wives implicitly resituated women in a\nsecondary role as a community ideal for which to struggle. The fact that the\ntransformative qualities of the women\u2019s actions during the strike depended\n\u201cSide by Side With Our Men?\u201d 75\nsignificantly upon female skills gained outside the home, was obscured. That\nmany women who lived in mining areas had independent community perspec-\ntives and prior histories of political activism was ignored. That the collective\nfemale action was not only local, but national and even global, based upon\npolitical values as much as place and identity, was not elaborated.\nMany women who were miners\u2019 wives did, of course, find in the support\ngroups a means of coping with and contributing to the strike. Strategically,\ntheir activism was privileged in order to emphasize the solidarities of family\nand community and to communicate the strength of the striking miners.\nHowever the rhetoric of \u201cthe wife\u201d obscured the varied positions adopted by\nminers\u2019 wives and compounded the silence around the importance of the\npublic responsibilities taken by women:\nWe had Florence. You see, with her being on the Council and always being set up\nto do things properly, our support group was structured from the start.51\nMoreover, not all miners\u2019 wives were active in the strike:\nThe notion that there had been a great big army of very politicized miners\u2019 wives\nthat had risen up and done this and that . . . it wasn\u2019t remotely true. God, if they\nhad we would have had an easy time of it. . .52\nSome wives had jobs whose work became the only source of family income\nduring the strike. Some women, employed by the NCB in canteens and\noffices, were on strike on their own account whether or not they were wives.\nMany involved in support groups were not wives at all. Often it was the\nmothers of miners who stimulated local female action.53 The different women\ninvolved drew from a combination of informal and formal networks, deploying\nskills gained from waged work and from participation in public institutions,\nincluding the Labour Party.\nThe skills used by activist women might be considered a type of \u201cbridging\u201d\nsocial capital connecting the traditional female sphere of family\/neighborhood\nwith the male sphere of politics and social organization.54 Only very rarely\ndid the men undertake a \u201cbridging\u201d role into the informal community dimen-\nsions of family and neighborhood. The experience of women active in local\nLabour Party and community politics prior to 1984 was crucial in structuring,\ninforming, and sustaining the women\u2019s activities during the strike.55 It was pri-\nmarily this which enabled them to link the personal meanings of the strike\nwith the values of community and left-wing politics to such powerful effect.\nThe mobilization of pre-existing skills and knowledge used with reference to\nthe traditional and more stereotyped versions of women\u2019s roles contributed\nto the powerful \u201cbonding\u201d associated with the values of community promoted\nduring the miners\u2019 strike. Myrtle MacPherson, quoted below, did not mention\neither her paid employment in school kitchens or her role as a parish councillor,\n76 ILWCH, 75, Spring 2009\nbut she effectively used both in order to achieve cooperation from a wide con-\nstituency of supporters in the neighborhood:\nThe whole year they got a meal at dinner time. One man had a fish and chip shop\nand he sent us flour and everything and once a week he made us fish cakes and\nchips for them. He used to send potatoes and the lard for the pastry. I used to\ndo the pastry and take it over there and do the corned beef mash. The girls\nused to put it into the tins for us and I used to roll out and they used to put the\ntops on for me and I used to milk them. The lad who was the baker had been a\nschool friend of my husband\u2019s and he said, \u201cIf you like, I\u2019ll be putting the ovens\noff and I can finish off the pies for you.\u201d So he used to cook them and bring\nthem up for us.56\nThe practical and strategic realities of serving the cause of the strike thus drew\nupon conceptions of women\u2019s traditional role through the rhetorical device of\ncommunity. This enabled women to assert the value of their domestic and\nrelationship skills in the political sphere giving romantic vigor to the public dis-\ncourse of the struggle as one of ordinary men and women fighting to save a way\nof life. However, it simultaneously accommodated conservative views of gender\nby allowing the possibility of women\u2019s activism to be resituated and confined to\nthose traditional roles. Characteristics of loyalty, friendship, sympathy, generos-\nity, and solidarity, and the interdependence of different groups in mining dis-\ntricts were emphasized and reaffirmed by the experience of mutual support.\nThese could be, and were, connected with nostalgic representations of mining\ncommunity and recollections of past struggles as much as with possibilities for\nan alternative future.\nChanging Perceptions\nThroughout the strike, women were allocated responsibility for domestic and\nemotional labor, while the men assumed primary responsibility for strategic\nand political labor. Female activism at the beginning was located in the tra-\nditional institutions associated with community life (community centers and\nwelfare halls), concentrated upon feeding and nurturing, while male activism\nwas located at the sites of work (the mines) concentrated on picketing, mobiliz-\ning political alliances, and negotiating.57 However, as the strike progressed, so\ntoo did the complexity of the activism:\nAt that first meeting . . . the women were given lessons in what benefits they were\nentitled to. The second one was on what constitutes food parcels. . . . The third was\non fundraising. Now I just brought the women together thinking they could\norganize themselves from there. . . . Then suddenly I became Co-ordinator . . .58\nMany women found themselves taking organizing roles which were not expres-\nsive of women\u2019s traditional place as an apparently accidental consequence of\n\u201cSide by Side With Our Men?\u201d 77\ntheir desire to do something practical to help striking families to survive, but\neven here they brought into play other skills and allegiances.59 Female involve-\nment was based on their own personal histories, which were frequently outside\nthe conventionally understood parameters of the lives of women in the commu-\nnity life of mining:\nMy involvement was initially with CND nationally and in Peace Action Durham\nlocally. I was about 23\u201324 at the time, had three young children and was involved\nin the \u201cWoodcraft Folk.\u201d. . . I was not married to a miner. . .60\nSuch women often began by accommodating themselves to the principal work of\nthe early support groups, cooking meals and distributing parcels, but inevitably\nthey increasingly mobilized their political expertise and networks, extending the\npossibilities for activist development beyond the boundaries imposed by the per-\nsonal relations of mining community and the political relations of the NUM.61\nSome women who participated in the strike came from places where the pit\nwas already closed. Their engagement drew upon networks disassociated from\ncommunity as place and gaining community from a broader political\nconstituency:\nWe didn\u2019t get the support in this village during the miners\u2019 strike. It was just the\nminers\u2019 wives that stuck together. Other people said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got a job. Get\nback to it.\u201d And we were cut off. . . . Where the pit was they seemed to be\nalright because they could have canteen support and whatever. We didn\u2019t have\na pit. We were stuck out here and we had no support. So that\u2019s when I had to\nwrite away to all these different Labour Parties all over the country.62\nThe basis of the strike partnership between men and women was never straight-\nforward. Women\u2019s \u201csupport\u201d groups signified the secondary and dependent\nnature of female participation. However, these groups developed their own\ninternal dynamic. Association in the women\u2019s groups was not dependent upon\nmining life, even when the group adopted an \u201cauthentic\u201d rule for membership,\nbut upon solidarities between women choosing to support a particular political\nstruggle. Identification did not depend upon \u201cidentity\u201d so much as upon a rec-\nognition of common interests and values. However the terms of the central\nstruggle remained in the male arena of mining and the NUM. Inevitably in\nthese circumstances, relationships between women andmen, between individual\nmembers of support groups and between the support groups and the NUMwere\ncharacterized not only by cooperation, but also conflict and resistance regarding\ngender and authority, inevitably exacerbated by the experience of an intense\nand painful year of struggle.63\nThe miners\u2019 strike asserted the importance of class solidarity at a time when\nclass was being displaced by different \u201cissues,\u201d including that of gender, in pol-\nitical organization. With working-class activism in retreat, the supportive role of\nwomen for the strike suggested possibilities for uniting class struggle with a\n78 ILWCH, 75, Spring 2009\nrange of private and public issues. \u201cCommunity\u201d was a loose enough concept to\nemphasize commonality across difference, distinguishing this struggle from the\nmeanings associated with labor disputes of the 1970s, which had been used to\ndiscredit the Left. It also effectively elided negative connotations of feminism;\nfemale activism performed in service of the larger community had no need of\nfeminism or an independent women\u2019s movement.64\nCommunity cooperation didn\u2019t just \u201chappen\u201d as activity derived from\ntraditional female responsibilities for family and neighborhood. Initiative and\nleadership were required to realize support for the strike in practice. Thus indi-\nvidual women who understood community in terms of politics and values rather\nthan as simply a feature of place or lived identity, often came to the fore:\nYou could not have got a more hard-working person than Heather. She was fan-\ntastic. This is what I mean about the myths of the self-motivated women who rose\nup. They didn\u2019t. Heather . . . was very active politically with the Labour Party and it\nwas all political activists who started everything really in the coalfield. And . . . she\nwent to all these places and said, \u201cLook you have got to get yourselves a support\ngroup . . .\u201d and she started it up and she kept it going. . . . Her husband is a\nplumber.65\nAmbiguities in the meaning of community were intrinsic to the support of the\nstrike. Women Against Pit Closures (WAPC) demonstrated its concern with\nlegitimacy and the authenticity of community by insisting that 75 percent of\nits membership be frommining families. Yet although this confirmed acceptance\nof dependence upon male-dominated community, the conservatism of the pos-\nition enabledWAPC to use its influence with the NUM to facilitate an extensive\ncampaign in the UK and abroad which extended the normal terrain of female\ninfluence and the discourses of trade unionism. WAPC\u2019s positioning invited\nNUM acknowledgement of the value of female political activism, and offered\naccess to male-dominated political territory. New and more extensive networks,\ncombined with increased opportunities to speak on behalf of the miners\u2019 cause\ncreated new bridging dimensions to female social capital. Thus WAPC was able\nultimately to extend its terms of reference beyond community as place and\nbeyond traditional roles and positions for women:\nIts aims include the promotion and development of education for working class\nwomen and campaigns on all issues which affect mining communities, particularly\npeace, jobs, health and education, and the issues of nuclear power and nuclear\nweapons.66\nThe tension between conservatism and transformative action within WAPC\nexpressed a central difficulty of the wider movement of women who supported\nthe miners\u2019 strike. By inhabiting their traditional roles in community life and by\nperforming these roles in relation to an undifferentiated view of class, family,\nand place, women could appeal to the nostalgia of the male-dominated labor\n\u201cSide by Side With Our Men?\u201d 79\nmovement, which was under serious attack, and could play an important part in\nhelping to reunite factions around the miners\u2019 cause. However, participation in\npolitical action went beyond the control of the male-dominated union. Women\nestablished their own networks amongst themselves and with other community\ngroups and movements where different, value-led versions of community chal-\nlenged inherited traditional meanings tied to mining.\nInevitably, organized female action became increasingly problematic for\npreconceived ideas about women\u2019s place in and relationship with mining com-\nmunity. Self-awareness and perhaps an acknowledgement of \u201cperformance\u201d\nwas expressed in the decision of one women\u2019s support group to choose to call\nitself \u201cMiners\u2019 Wives\u201d after the strike was over. Although many members\nwere not miners\u2019 wives, this group argued that the term would enable them to\nbe understood by \u201coutsiders\u201d in terms of their class allegiance and would\nensure legitimacy and respect for their action in the post-industrial context.67\nSome women took up a different position, claiming the authenticity which\nthey had promoted, attempting to relive and consolidate traditional ideas of a\ncommon identity. Authentic position-taking reasserted the uniqueness and sepa-\nrateness of mining community, drawing upon the heritage of political struggle\nand paying particular homage to the oral history of the experience of the\n1926 lockout when, ironically, the miners were also defeated. Community as\nmarshalled by these women raised serious disputes about \u201cbelonging,\u201d ques-\ntioning who was entitled to join support groups, who was \u201cone of us\u201d and\n\u201cnot one of us.\u201d68 Such a tightly defined view of community was defensive\nand inward looking, continuous with the historical self-protectionism character-\nistic of isolated mining villages of the past. It also fed into a nostalgia that\nremains in the post-mining period. The appeal to authenticity was inextricably\nconnected with a view of class in which the subject positions of women as\nwomen were secondary to their support for the class struggle in which, as\nwives, their interests were held to be inscribed.\nIt was those women whose activism was prompted by considerations other\nthan any relationship with a miner who were most active in questioning the\nmeaning of authenticity of community and its relevance for the struggle.\nThese women challenged inherited gender positions and conservative views of\nclass associated with mining identity:\nWe were all working class and what united us in that class definition wasn\u2019t about\nwhether your dad was a doctor, a teacher, or what job he did, but was the values we\nshared. The values of believing that fighting for a society based on collectivism,\nand a society not based on private greed; [it] was the class values we shared;\nand what struggle threw up, was a redefining of class in a way.69\nThe links made between different women associated with the miners\u2019 cause and\nwith supporters outside mining, rather than the claim to authenticity, were\nresponsible for the dynamism of the movement.70 Such links opened the possi-\nbility of informed choices beyond what was normally ascribed to women\n80 ILWCH, 75, Spring 2009\nassociated with mining. This was manifest in the common cause made with non-\ntraditional political identity groups such as lesbians and gays and also through\nthe international contact made with the wider labor and trade union movement.\nBoth of these features of the experience of the strike challenged closed ideas\nabout women\u2019s role in the work-family-community model of mining, extending\nthe idea of community as commonality of politics and values and opening the\npossibility of community-building as an activity separate from mining itself in\nwhich women could play an independent and active role.\nConclusion\nCommunity is an emotive concept, which serves both conservative and progress-\nive purposes. Within it the implications for gender relations are seldom ana-\nlyzed. The enactment of community through the miners\u2019 strike, drawing on\nrepresentations, experiences, memories, hopes, and imagination of what a com-\nmunity could be, situated female action at a pivotal political conjuncture in\nwhich a series of hitherto fixed gender dichotomies where thrown into flux.\nWomen activists in the miners\u2019 strike were positioned in traditional and\nconservative community roles. Not everyone involved fitted the description\nof \u201cminers\u2019 wives,\u201d and whatever their relationship with mining the skills\nbase from which they drew was independent of domestic positioning. Women\nused traditional conceptions of community to galvanize their organization.\n\u201cCommunity\u201d allowed and demanded political involvement without disturbing\npartnership with men or threatening the men\u2019s cause. However, support for the\nmen\u2019s strike was undertaken in terms that both reaffirmed and challenged tra-\nditional female dependence in mining life; the fluidity of the concept of commu-\nnity as a central organizing trope facilitated the possibility of holding both\npositions and working within ambiguity.\nThe dominant discourse of female activism in the strike is located in a com-\nmunity studies model of mining relationships and involves privileging historical\nrelationships, which were dissonant with the real conditions of 1984. Women\nfound themselves performing roles that resituated their activism in an undiffer-\nentiated historical model. While relevant to maintaining solidarity in the strike,\nthis was neither expressive of everyday lived relations, nor of their own histories.\nInsofar as the performance was sustained, it was inevitable that individual\nfemale activism would not survive the strike. Insofar as an independent and self-\ndefining activism was achieved, it was more likely to emerge after the strike to\ninhabit a different understanding of the nature and value of community.\nThe actual female experience of organization and activism increasingly\nhighlighted the importance of political values in the establishment and mainten-\nance of community in which human agency plays a key role. Gender and com-\nmunity became reflexive categories for some women through the process of\ninvolvement in the strike, but for others, their awareness was enhanced rather\nthan created by strike activism.\n\u201cSide by Side With Our Men?\u201d 81\nThe history of the engagement of women in the regions affected by pit clo-\nsures since the strike is indicative of the significance of female agency, as women\nbecame involved in creating, leading, and sustaining locally based regeneration\nprojects, adult education, and citizen action informed by ideals of community\ncohesion.71\nAnalysis of mining community and ex-mining community has been dis-\ntorted by monodimensional perspectives that ignore the historical changes in\nmining and that fail to acknowledge the complexity associated with female\nagency in that history. During the miners\u2019 strike, women did stand \u201cside by\nside\u201d with the men. Yet they did not do so simply from a sense of their tra-\nditional roles in maintaining community cohesion, but also self-consciously as\na means of contributing to the maintenance of the strike and to promote the\nsocialist values that it represented. Understanding their experiences and the\nstrategies adopted to deal with their realities has much to offer in relation to\nbroader contemporary problems associated with the regeneration of localities\nand with the regeneration of an activist political engagement in which women\nreally do stand \u201cside by side\u201d with men across a range of social and economic\nfronts.\nNOTES\n\u0002 The authors wish to thank Monica Shaw and Anne Suddick.\n1.
