On the one hand, the \nRicardo-Viner specific factors model implies that owners of two fac- \ntors-land and capital-stood diametrically opposed to one another on \nthe issue of free trade. In the end, according to this view, capital gained \nthe upper hand as seen in the i846 repeal of the Corn Laws. On the other \nhand, studies in the economic history literature posit that the economic \ninterests of these two groups of factor owners were not mutually exclu- \nsive; rather, their interests overlapped as a result of rapid economic \nchanges in the i830s that intensified landowner diversification into non- \nagricultural ventures. The implication of the latter approach is that land- \nowners as a group came to be divided between undiversified landowners, \nwhose economic interests remained tied to agriculture, and diversified \nlandowners, whose interests in agriculture had lessened while their in- \nterests in nonagricultural sectors had increased. Hence, the undiversified \ngroup remained the only true \"losers\" from free trade in grain; members \nof the diversified group, by contrast, stood to gain or simply became \nindifferent to free trade. \n* An earlier version of this paper was presented at the i989 Joint Annual Convention of \nthe British International Studies Association and the International Studies Association and \nat the i989 All-U.C. Group in Economic History Conference. Comments from John Cony- \nbeare, Jeff Frieden, Barbara Geddes, Arye Hillman, David Lake, Peter Lindert, Tim Mc- \nKeown, and Daniel Verdier were very helpful.

Elsewhere, I have demonstrated the validity of this assumption.' \nThe scope and intent of this paper, then, is twofold. First, it discusses the \nspecific factors model and its inadequacies as applied to nineteenth- \ncentury Britain, and it introduces two modifications that allow the model \nto account for the anomalies we observe in the British case. That is, I \nalter two key assumptions of the specific factors model by introducing \nthe concepts of portfolio diversification and investment capital flows into \nthe framework of factor specificity in the short run. The predicted polit- \nical consequence of this modified version of the model is that diversifi- \ncation lessened widespread protectionist sentiment among the landed \nelite. In the context of a broader equilibrium model of trade policy lib- \neralization, it disrupted the initial protectionist equilibrium by decreas- \ning the political benefits that accrued to M.P.'s from voting in favor of \nprotection.2 Portfolio diversification alone did not give rise to free trade \nin Great Britain; but rather it was one of several factors that shifted the \npolitical cost\/benefit ratio of M.P.'s in favor of free trade. \nSecond, this paper extends the concept of portfolio diversification, as \npresented in the economic history literature, to the realm of policy- \nmaking, using a statistical examination of the correlation between dimin- \nishing protectionist sentiment-through diversification-and the free \ntrade policy outcome. \nTHE SPECIFIC FACTORS MODEL AND THE LONG- AND SHORT-RUN \nDIMENSIONS OF CAPITAL FORMATION \nThe Ricardo-Viner specific factors model in neoclassical trade theory de- \nfines some factor inputs as industry specific and others as intersectorally \nmobile. Industry-specific factors give rise to industry-specific interests \nthat may either favor or oppose protection, depending upon the form of \ntrade competition facing the industry. Owners of factors specific to the \ndomestic import-competing industry gain from protection (via a rela- \ntively higher price obtained from the industry good), while owners of \nfactors specific to the export sector lose (similarly, via the relatively lower \nprice of the industry good). The preference of the mobile factor owner \n(for example, labor) is ambiguous; that is, although he can move into the \nI Cheryl Schonhardt-Bailey, \"A Model of Trade Policy Liberalization: Looking Inside the \nBritish 'Hegemon' of the Nineteenth Century\" (Ph.D. diss., University of California, Los \nAngeles, i99i), chap. 3. \n2 Ibid., chap. i. \nThis content downloaded from 158.143.192.135 on Wed, 16 Apr 2014 04:14:16 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\nREPEAL OF THE CORN LAWS 547 \nprotected sector, his welfare remains contingent upon his unique con- \nsumption preferences. It follows that owners of factors specific to a par- \nticular industry will tend to seek protection for their industry and oppose \nprotection for any other industry, whereas mobile factor owners will re- \nmain largely inactive. \nStandard trade theory texts applying the specific factors model to Brit- \nain and the repeal of the Corn Laws posit (i) that landowners (that is, \nowners of factors specific to the import-competing industry) and capital- \nists (that is, owners of factors specific to the export sector) deriving in- \ncomes from undiversified claims to factors opposed each other and (2) \nthat after i832 industrialists had taken over Parliament, thereby engi- \nneering the shift toward free trade.3 The standard application of the spe- \ncific factors model to the British case is correct in assuming that factors \nremained industry specific and that trade policy had the effect of redis- \ntributing income, thereby creating unambiguous winners and losers. \nHowever, the two points posited are incorrect. \nTaking the second point first, while the i832 Reform had extended \nsuffrage to many middle-class manufacturers,4 it did not, by i 846, sub- \nstantially alter the composition of Parliament. The Parliament of i841- \n47 remained firmly under the control of landowners. By one estimate, \nabout 8o percent of Parliament consisted of the landowning aristocracy \nand gentry.5 Certainly if landowners as a group in Parliament wished to \nhalt the repeal legislation, they had the votes to do so. \nIt is, however, the first problematic aspect to which this paper is di- \nrected. The specific factors model implicitly assumes that (i) undiversi- \nfied holdings of factors prevail (that is, each person owns only one, or \nprimarily only one, factor of production), and (2) capital as a factor of \nproduction refers to the stock of fixed capital available for productive \npurposes. Extensions to neoclassical trade theory have at times relaxed \nthe first assumption but have generally retained the second. Mayer, for \ninstance, constructs an equilibrium tariff model that allows each person \nto own more than one factor and that allows factor shares to vary among \npeople.6 Each factor owner has an optimal tariff rate, the value of which \nis determined by the individual's factor ownership. The equilibrium tar- \n3 This application appears in Richard E. Caves and Ronald W. Jones, World Trade and \nPayments (Boston: Little, Brown, i985). \n4 Before i832 a significant number of manufacturers would have had sufficient property \nqualifications to vote; they would have done so, however, in constituencies where they con- \nstituted a small percentage of the electorate. \n5 W. 0.

Mayer applies the idea of diversified holdings both to the long- \nrun Heckscher-Ohlin model and its resulting Stolper-Samuelson Theo- \nrem and to the short-run specific factors model. His intent is not to \nbridge the two models through the mechanism of portfolio diversifica- \ntion; rather, it is to explore the implications of his modified assumptions \nfor the long-run adjustment of tariffs to changes in the distribution of \nfactor ownership, voting costs, and voter eligibility rules and for the \nshort-run attempts of small minorities of factor owners-under majority \nvoting-to obtain tariff protection for their industries. \nIn contrast to Mayer's application of diversified holdings, this paper \nalters part of the assumption of undiversified holdings in the specific \nfactors model and considers capital in two forms-as stocks and flows. \nWith regard to diversified holdings, I argue that income accruing from \nthe ownership of a specific factor (for example, capital originating from \nthe productive use of land) could be invested in other, more profitable \nsectors of the economy.7 As a consequence, the allocation of capital flows \ndiffered markedly from the allocation of capital stocks. Moreover, this \nflow of investment capital from one sector to another was facilitated by \nthe newly emerging market in long-term capital, as evidenced by the \nrapid growth in British stock market activity during the second quarter \nof the nineteenth century. \nTheoretically, the beginnings of a capital market can be interpreted as \nthe start of a transition from a state in which capital is fixed to one in \nwhich it becomes more mobile between sectors. In Britain capital flows, \nresponding to unequalized returns, shifted into higher yield industrial \nsectors of the economy, thereby altering the ownership distribution of \ncapital stock. (Hence, a corollary argument may be given for capital mar- \nket creation; that is, the more the allocation of flows diverges from the \nallocation of stocks, the greater the need for a capital market.) It should \nbe acknowledged, however, that other forces may have come into play \nto delay the emergence of a long-run equilibrium for returns to invest- \nment across the different sectors. In the short run the new free-trade \npolicy may have added to the existing inequality of returns by rewarding \nthe owners of industrial capital (unless the capital market had previously \nfully taken into account the returns from a policy change-an unlikely \n7For an excellent discussion of nineteenth-century British investors' responsiveness to fluc- \ntuations in investment opportunities, see R. C. Michie, Money, Mania and Markets: Investment, \nCompany Formation and the Stock Exchange in Nineteenth-Century Scotland (Edinburgh: John \nDonald, 198I). \nThis content downloaded from 158.143.192.135 on Wed, 16 Apr 2014 04:14:16 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\nREPEAL OF THE CORN LAWS 549 \nevent in such a nascent market). Thus, in the short run capital flows \ncould, if sufficient, have generated a trade policy shift that created more \ninequality of returns, not equalization, even though in the very long run \nreturns should have equalized. Nonetheless, the essential point is that \nthe new ownership distribution created economic and political incentives \nfor a policy change that favored owners of industrial stock (for example, \na move to remove protection for agriculture). This said, the contribution \nof this paper is quite modest: it introduces portfolio diversification in \nnineteenth-century Britain into a medium-run model with a \"dynamic\" \ncomponent, that is, capital flows that reflect divergent returns in industry \nand agriculture. \nMore to the point, however, portfolio diversification significantly al- \nters the political interpretation originally posited by the specific factors \nmodel. Protective tariffs continued to be ardently favored or opposed by \nthe owners of factors tied to specific industries.8 However, the policy \nstance of factor owners whose returns could be reallocated elsewhere \nbecame ambiguous. This was so especially where these returns (in the \nform of investment capital) found their most profitable outlet in indus- \ntries specific to other factor inputs. The interests of these individuals \nwould have derived from each person's unique portfolio-that is, from \nthe extent of diversified holdings or, interpreted strictly, from the dis- \ncounted expected future income stream from holdings under each policy \nalternative (the latter clearly more difficult o gauge than the former).9 \nSimply put, as landholders diversified more extensively, their interests \neither began to resemble more closely those of industrialists favoring free \ntrade or became less sharply defined, thus bordering on indifference. \nOnly those individuals who could not diversify out of agriculture (for \nexample, tenant farmers and landowners on the verge of insolvency) \nwould remain staunch advocates of protectionism.Io Since the specific \nfactors model misses the importance of a growing British capital market, \nit fails to recognize that the support for protectionism was diffusing \n8 These were individuals who were under some compulsion-perhaps impending insol- \nvency-to reinvest flows in a factor that yielded less than (an) other factor(s). \n9 In an ideal world one would not engage a static model but rather would look to a dy- \nnamic one that incorporated future expected returns. \n'? It should be mentioned that undiversified farmers were enticed by the government to \nacquiesce to repeal, as evidenced most clearly in the \"drainage loan\" portion of the repeal \nlegislation; see D. C. Moore, \"The Corn Laws and High Farming,\" Economic History Review, \n2d ser., i8, no. 3 (i965), 544-6i. Nevertheless, many \"marginal\" farmers (i.e., grain farmers \nunable to increase production through advanced farming methods or unable to switch to \nother forms of farming) left Britain in the wake of repeal hoping to gain better returns for \ntheir capital investments in the U.S.; see William E. Van Vugt, \"Running from Ruin?: The \nEmigration of British Farmers to the U.S.A. in the Wake of the Repeal of the Corn Laws,\" \nEconomic History Review, 2d ser., 41, no. 3 (i988), 41 I-28. \nThis content downloaded from 158.143.192.135 on Wed, 16 Apr 2014 04:14:16 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\n550 WORLD POLITICS \nwithin the ranks of those who supposedly were its leading advocates. \nThe division between owners of factors and their supposed conflict of \ninterests, then, is much fuzzier than the model implies. \nTHE EVIDENCE \nEvidence for the portfolio diversification hypothesis is presented below \nin two forms-empirical and statistical. The former draws from the eco- \nnomic history literature and offers a compelling account of the progres- \nsion of diversification, especially its escalation from the late i820S to the \ni840s, a period of rapid growth in the newly emerging stocks and shares \nmarket. The latter attempts to establish a link between growing diver- \nsification and M.P. voting behavior on the question of free trade in grain. \nDIVERSIFICATION IN ECONOMIC HISTORY \nDiversification of portfolios by landowners was by no means a new de- \nvelopment in the nineteenth century. Beginning in the late sixteenth and \nearly seventeenth centuries, both the older aristocracy and the rising gen- \ntry invested extensively in nonagricultural activities, including minerals \nand mining (coal, lead, steel, salt, alum, and so forth), urban develop- \nment, shipping, and joint-stock companies. Lawrence Stone explained \nthat even though \"industry was not the road to great riches,\" it provided \nto both peers and gentry an interesting diversion, and an extension of the \ntaste for gambling. In his analysis of 158 peerage families during the \nperiod 1560-i639, Stone found that 25 percent of these profited by min- \ning activities on their estates; 9 percent invested in fen drainage; 15 per- \ncent in developing London; 14 percent in shipping; and 63 percent in \ntrading, colonial, and industrial concerns. Moreover, he found the older \nnobility no less willing to invest in nonagricultural activities than was the \nnewer nobility.ii \nJ. H. Plumb extended the notion of diversification to the eighteenth \ncentury. According to Plumb, cheap water transport (provided through \ncanal ventures) allowed greater diversification of portfolios among the \ngentry.'2 The opening of rivers and coastal traffic both enhanced agri- \ncultural production by creating new metropolitan markets for agricul- \ntural goods and created new outlets for enterprises in timber sales, \ngravel, and minerals. \nStone, The Crisis of the Aristocracy I556-i64i (Oxford: Oxford University Press, i965), \n377-83. \n12 Plumb, The Growth of Political Stability in England, i675-I725 (London: Macmillan, \ni967), 5- \nThis content downloaded from 158.143.192.135 on Wed, 16 Apr 2014 04:14:16 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\nREPEAL OF THE CORN LAWS 551 \nConsequently, by the early nineteenth century some landowners were \nat least marginally involved in industrial activities. The obvious question \nis then, why, given some degree of diversification, did landowners sup- \nport agricultural protection as long as they did? It may be that (i) land- \nowners diversified but the returns on their nonagricultural income were \ninconsequential relative to their agricultural income, (2) landowners' in- \nvestment in nonagricultural sectors was small relative to their agricul- \ntural holdings, or (3) numbers of landowners actually diversifying re- \nmained few relative to those not diversifying. A fourth and quite \ndifferent explanation is that the type of industrialization in the eigh- \nteenth century differed from that in the nineteenth; whereas the former \nwas led by domestic demand, the latter was led by exports. Thus, land- \nowners diversifying into industry in the eighteenth century would likely \nhave retained their preference for agricultural protection, whereas land- \nowners similarly diversifying in the nineteenth century would not. In \nany case, two critical economic changes in the second quarter of the nine- \nteenth century the expansion of exports in mining and heavy industry \nand the development of the capital market-marked that period as a \nturning point. There was an increase in (i) returns to diversified hold- \nings, (2) the size of nonagricultural holdings, and (3) the numbers of \nlandowners diversifying. These changes, moreover, transformed the pro- \ncess of investing outside of agriculture all of which dampened land- \nowner support for agricultural protection. Interestingly, both changes \nseem to have been triggered by (or to have coincided with) the same \nevent the beginning of the railway boom in the mid-i83os (peaking in \ni836-37 and again in i844-46). \nThe first such sudden economic change was the expansion of exports \nin mining and heavy industry. While export growth and the railway \nbooms should actually be considered a two-way causal relationship,'3 this \n'3 The literature xplaining the various linkages between railways and the development of \nheavy industry in Britain is considerable. For instance, Llewellyn Woodward wrote that \"the \nrailways were one of the results of progress in the iron industry and of the increased con- \nsumption of coal brought about by the use of steam power. They were in turn the cause of a \nvast expansion in the metal trades and of a much greater demand for coal. Directly or indi- \nrectly they influenced the development of most industries in the country. [In addition] the \nrailway itself was an article of export; British contractors built lines in every continent and \norganized companies to buy them\"; see Woodward, The Age of Reform, i8I5-i870 (Oxford: \nOxford University Press, i962), 4V. E. J. Hobsbawm found that the \"immense [coal] industry, \nthough probably not expanding fast enough for really massive industrialization on the mod- \nern scale, was sufficiently large to stimulate the basic invention which was to transform the \ncapital-goods industries: the railway. For the mines not only required steam-engines in large \nquantities and of great power, but also required efficient means of transporting the great \nquantities of coal from coal-face to shaft and especially from pit-head to the point of ship- \nment. The 'tramway' or 'railway' along which trucks ran was an obvious answer.... Tech- \nnologically the railway is the child of the mine, and especially the northern English coal \nThis content downloaded from 158.143.192.135 on Wed, 16 Apr 2014 04:14:16 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\n552 WORLD POLITICS \nsudden export growth nevertheless was created in the very industries \n(coal, iron, steel) in which landowners had been longtime investors.'4 \nAlthough their portfolios already included such investments, the inten- \nsity and economic importance of these investments had increased with \nthe growth of these industries.I5 \nThe second change was the development of the capital market. Al- \nthough the beginnings of a formal market in capital may be traced to \nlong-term borrowing by the state in the late seventeenth century, it was \nnot until the early i8oos that the London Stock Exchange drafted a con- \nstitution and obtained its own building. The market of the eighteenth \ncentury was not a national market; rather, it was concentrated in London \nand largely confined to the trade of government securities.'6 From the \nbeginning of the nineteenth century to the mid-i82os, very little share \ntrading existed outside London. However, with the repeal in i825 of the \nBubble Act (which had required all companies to obtain a royal charter \nor an Act of Parliament and made it illegal for any broker to buy or sell \nmine\"; see Hobsbawm, The Age of Revolution, I789-i848 (New York: New American Li- \nbrary, i962), 63. He added that \"in the first two decades of the railways (i830-i850) the \noutput of iron in Britain rose from 68oooo to 2,250,000 [tons].... The output of coal between \ni830 and i85o also trebled from i5 million tons to 49 million tons. That dramatic rise was \ndue primarily to the railway, for on average each mile of the line required 300 tons of iron \nmerely for track\" (p. 64). \nB. R. Mitchell clearly sketches the correlation between rising demand in the iron and coal \nindustries and the railway booms and, moreover, the subsequent royalties accruing to land- \nowners. For example, Mitchell explains that royalties usually consisted of a fixed rent plus a \nroyalty paid according to the amount of coal extracted. From the early nineteenth century to \nthe i 870s, royalties averaged between 8% and I I% of coal sales, or 6d to 9d per ton, or ?50 \nto ?i8o per acre; see Mitchell, Economic Development of the British Coal Industry, I8oo-I9I4 \n(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, i984), 251-58. \nIt should be noted that while recent British historiography has discounted the Rostowian \nnotion of a sudden industrial \"takeoff\" period, such revisions have applied not to the heavy \nindustry stage of industrialization beginning in the i83os but rather to the period from \nroughly 1780 to i830; see N. F. R. Crafts, British Economic Growth during the Industrial \nRevolution (Oxford: Oxford University Press, i985). Other useful sources that address the \nlinkages between railways and the development of heavy industry (not to mention the large \nliterature simply on railway development) include P. L. Cottrell, Industrial Finance, i830- \nI9I4 (London: Methuen, ig80); F. M. L. Thompson, English Landed Society in the Nineteenth \nCentury (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, i963); and G. N. von Tunzelmann, Steam \nPower and British Industrialization to i86o (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1978). \n14 See Thompson (fn. 13) for a discussion of the mineral incomes of several great landown- \ners (e.g., Dukes of Northumberland and Portland, the Earl of Carlisle, Lords Hastings and \nRokeby, Sir Matthew White Ridley, and the Earl of Durham) and gentry (e.g., the Claytons, \nCrofts, Bates, Edens, Riddells, Wrightsons). He noted that \"landowners certainly drew large \nand increasing incomes from coal, but these were predominantly and increasingly in the \nshape of royalty and wayleave rents\" (p. 264). Some gentry received mineral income equal to \nhalf their total income. \n15 One might add that landowners would be far more likely to invest in industries (mostly \nheavy) that had land occupying a larger share of assets-i.e., coal, iron, railways-than such \nlight industries as cotton textiles. \ni6 See, e.g., Cottrell (fn. 13); and E.

After i830 a \ncompany needed only to advertise in a railway journal that stocks were \navailable to be flooded with applications. For example, in i836 the New \nGravesend Railway received 8oooo applications for the 30,000 available \nshares; the Great North of Scotland Railway, more than three times the \nnumber of its shares in i845; the Direct Western Railway, 1,400,000 ap- \nplications for its 120,000 shares; and the Direct London-Exeter, 400,000 \nfor its 120,000 shares.'9 \nAside from later technological changes (telegraph, telephone), railway \nshares offered the single most important factor in the integration of Brit- \nain's emerging capital market-a common security that could be traded \nactively on more than one market. Without common securities, \"local- \nized imbalances in the supply of, or demand for, stocks and shares would \ncontinue to result in dramatic price fluctuations and an inability to meet \nrequirements. With common securities, local price changes would gen- \nerate an immediate flow from, or to, that centre so that all markets \nwould rise and fall in line.\"20 \nSuch common securities contributed especially to diminishing the pre- \nviously localized nature of the provincial markets, as active trading be- \ntween markets outside of London expanded throughout the i83os and \ni840s.

During the \nperiod i830-40 the massive expansion in the Scottish coal and iron in- \ndustry led to an expansion of mining and heavy industry, which in turn \nrequired substantial investment capital.23 Concurrently, the number of \ninvestors benefiting directly from the output of the enterprise (a feature \nof the earlier localized nature of investment) decreased, while the num- \nber of investors seeking primarily to maximize the return on tradable \ninvestment rose. By the end of the i83os a national share market had \ndeveloped in Scotland, with insurance companies and railway shares ex- \nperiencing the most rapid growth. The early i84os brought economic \nprosperity and with it surplus funds seeking investment opportunities. \nGiven the excess funds in circulation, banks lowered their interest rates,24 \nand consequently, stocks became \"the most eligible and favourite\" form \nof investment. Moreover, during the early i84os higher rates of return \nfrom railway shares markedly altered the structure of the Scottish in- \nvestment economy by elevating the importance of railway capital at the \nexpense of all other investment sectors.25 \nJust as railway shares provided a common security for the provincial \nstock exchanges, so too did they link the emerging Scottish exchanges \nwith their English counterparts. In i846, for instance, English sharehold- \ners were the source of 38 percent of the funds provided for Scottish rail- \nways by large investors.26 This cross-investment was not one-sided, how- \never, as Scots similarly sought stock in English railways.27 Finally, in \naddition to the provincial and Scottish stock exchanges, the London \nStock Exchange itself exhibited the speculative mania associated with the \nrailways.

In a presentation of the occupational breakdown of share- \nholders in various railway and utility companies, I demonstrate that es- \nquires and gentlemen held a strong interest in such investments.29 One \nhistorian has conservatively estimated the average percentage of gentle- \nmen\/landowners among subscribers for all railway companies floated in \ni844-45 to be i8 pecent,30 while others have estimated the figure for the \nperiod i820-44 to be 28 percent.3' In fact, many railway companies delib- \nerately reserved a certain percentage of shares (say, 20 percent) for land- \nowners. Landowners were considered valuable shareholders not only for \ntheir resources, but also because a company with a considerable number \nof landowners as shareholders could use this as clout to prevent present \nor future opposition to the railway line from other landowners.32 \nLandowner interest in railways stemmed not only from the ownership \nof shares but also from the high prices paid to them by the railway com- \npanies for their lands. Rather than face the possibility of legal battles over \nthe value of land-costing four times the price of those purchases un- \nopposed-railway promoters \"bought off' landowners by paying them, \non average, twice the current market value for their land. In fact, in I 844 \nthe Board of Trade estimated that the excess land costs alone made Bri- \ntain's railways ?iooo more expensive per mile than railways on the Con- \ntinent.33 \nEvidence from the economic history literature thus clearly traces in- \ncreasing diversification of the landed elite into mining and heavy indus- \ntry, as well as railway development. This is not to suggest, however, that \nsuch diversification directly translated into their conversion to a free- \n28 Morgan and Thomas (fn. i6), io6. \n29 Schonhardt-Bailey (fn. i), chap. 4, presents selected data from Killick and Thomas (fn. \n2I). \n30 S.

Coal, iron, and steel exports certainly became increas- \ningly more important in the i83os and i840s, but so, too, did domestic \nconsumption of these goods (especially for domestic railway construc- \ntion). Additionally, even landowner interests in railway promotion could \nin some cases be linked to the transportation of agricultural goods to \ndomestic markets rather than to the development of British export in- \ndustries. Nevertheless, diversification into potentially (and in some \nregions of the country, predominantly) nonagricultural ventures allowed \nlandowners to spread their investment risks among various sectors of the \neconomy not directly benefiting from the expansion (or maintenance) of \nBritish agricultural production. As stated earlier, the actual interests of \nthese individuals must be derived from each landowner's unique port- \nfolio, that is, the diversification of holdings (as a proxy for the discounted \nexpected future income stream from his holdings). Either, in the ex- \ntreme, landowner interests began to resemble those of industrialists fa- \nvoring free trade, or more moderately, their interests imply became less \nsharply defined, perhaps bordering on indifference. \nDIVERSIFICATION AND M.P. VOTING PATTERNS ON FREE TRADE \nPrevious studies that addressed the issue of diversification in the repeal \nof the Corn Laws generally focused on the individual interests of mem- \nbers of Parliament. A primary source of motivation for voting, according \nto this view, stemmed from the M.P.'s personal pecuniary interests. (In- \ndeed, one historian commented that the reason attempts by the i841-47 \ngovernment to regulate railways were doomed was that M.P.'s the ma- \njority of whom were shareholders in railways and one-seventh of whom \nwere railways directors-vigorously defeated any \"dangerously restric- \ntive\" proposals.)34 The argument continues that M.P.'s were beginning \nto diversify their personal portfolios in the years prior to i846: as they \nincreasingly invested in the business and industrial sectors of the econ- \nomy,35 they personally had less to lose and more to gain from eliminating \nagrarian protectionism. \nMy test of this hypothesis revealed that a transformation in the in- \ncomes of members of Parliament was indeed occurring, though not at a \n34Asa Briggs, The Age of Improvement, I783-i867 (London: Longman I959), 340. \n35 For general references to this argument, see Barrington Moore, Social Origins of Dicta- \ntorship and Democracy (Boston: Beacon Press, I966); and E. J. Hobsbawm, Industry and Em- \npire (London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, I968). For the specific application of this argument \nto the M.P.'s of i841-47, see W. 0. Aydelotte, \"The Business Interests of the Gentry in \nParliament of i84i-i847,\" in G. Kitson Clark, The Making of Victorian England (London: \nMethvent, I962), 290-307; and idem (fn. 5), 47-60.

Although he found a systematic relationship \nbetween voting behavior and \"personal pecuniary interests\" of M.P.'s, he \ndid not cite this as the-critical factor in the abolition of the Corn Laws.37 \nOne step beyond gauging the economic effect of portfolio diversifica- \ntion on members of Parliament entails examining its political effects, as \nchanneled through diversification by their constituents. It is the argu- \nment of this paper that as individuals (and constituencies in the aggre- \ngate) invested returns from land into nonagricultural ventures such as \nindustry and railways, political support for protectionism waned, and \nM.P.'s accordingly shifted their votes toward free trade. \nTwo approaches, differentiated by data type (individual versus aggre- \ngate), are adopted below for testing the relationship between diversifi- \ncation and M.P. voting behavior. Neither approach is ideal, but taken \ntogether they provide a reasonable test of the hypothesis. A better test of \ndiversification would rely exclusively on individual-level data in order to \ncapture the \"capital as flows\" element of the argument. That is, whereas \naggregate-level data may capture shifts in the overall distribution of land \nand capital ownership (and consequently diversification at the aggregate \nlevel), the underlying assumption is that all individuals have undertaken \nexactly the average diversification of their personal portfolios by invest- \ning returns from one factor into another factor. Landowners may instead \nhave moved wholly into the industrialists category; alternatively, the \nnumber of industrialists may have grown more quickly relative to land- \nowners. As such, individual and aggregate-level data will provide differ- \nent pictures of diversification. Individual-level diversification suggests \nthat capital operates as flows and that industry-specific nterests become \nless sharply defined in the political arena. Aggregate-level diversification \nmay indeed reflect individual-level diversification, in which case the \nsame argument holds; that is, capital \"flows\" and interests merge. Alter- \nnatively, diversification may occur only at the aggregate level, where- \nupon interests remain industry specific: landowners remain tied to agri- \n36 In an earlier phase of this project, I tested this hypothesis. In sum, I found that while \nunmistakable change in the economic interest composition of Parliament was occurring from \ni832 onward, the change was quite gradual. The landowning interest was steadily declining \nwhile that of business was steadily rising, overtaking the former by the i870s. I concluded \nthat it seemed likely that it was not the M.P.'s own economic interest that motivated him, \nbut that of his constituents. Transformations in the economic interests of constituents thus \ntook several decades to be reflected in the composition of Parliament. \n37 Timothy J. McKeown, \"The Politics of Corn Law Repeal Reconsidered\" (Paper pre- \nsented at the I987 annual meeting of the American Political Science Association, revised \nDecember I987). \nThis content downloaded from 158.143.192.135 on Wed, 16 Apr 2014 04:14:16 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\n558 WORLD POLITICS \ncultural protection, and industrialists, tied to free trade, although the \nbalance of interests becomes more evenly distributed. \nThere are drawbacks to relying solely on microlevel data: such data \nare rare for early-nineteenth-century Britain, and the available data are \nincomplete and inconsistent. Consequently, I test the diversification the- \nsis using both individual and aggregate data. Positive and consistent \nfindings at both levels of analysis would support the hypothesis that di- \nversification was indeed occurring at the individual level and that the \nmore aggregate-level statistics were an accurate reflection of this diver- \nsification. \nTESTING THE HYPOTHESIS \nTwo sources of data were used to test the hypothesis that M.P.'s who \nrepresented constituencies with greater diversification were more likely \nto vote in favor of free trade than were those representing less diversified \nagricultural constituencies. The first source-death duty registers38- \nprovides data at the individual level. The years i830 and i850 were cho- \nsen to construct a random sample of I percent for each year (i62 and I84 \nindividuals, respectively).39 (Elsewhere I describe the sampling technique \nin full.)40 \nThe components derived from the registers include (I) stocks (that is, \nstocks or shares in railways, utility companies, canals, joint-stock com- \npanies, insurance companies; investments in a business or trade; and \nmining interests-only when listed separately from real estate), (2) gov- \n38 Barbara English, \"Probate Valuations and the Death Duty Registers,\" Bulletin of the \nInstitute of Historical Research 58, no. 135 (May I984), argues that death duty registers offer \nmore complete records of business holdings than do probates. For example, the registers list \nstocks and shares, industrial machinery, business interests, and residual estate. They offer \nmore details as to the form in which wealth was held at death. Only since I982 have the \nregisters been opened to study by researchers for the period from 1796 to 1903. I did find, \nhowever, that for later years many registers remain closed, some until the year 2007. \nJane Cox describes and explains the contents, format, notations, and abbreviations relevant \nboth to probates and to death duty registers; see Cox, The Records of the Prerogative Court of \nCanterbury and the Death Duty Registers: A Provisional Guide (Canterbury: Public Record \nOffice, Prerogative Court of Canterbury, i980). \n39 Since i825 and i846 constitute roughly the critical years \"before\" and \"after\" the emer- \ngence of capital markets and diversification, and since we may assume that an individual \nwould most likely be at his financial peak not at his death but rather a few years prior, i830 \nand i850 appeared to be adequate choices for each time period sample. \n40 Schonhardt-Bailey (fn. i), chap. 4. In brief, however, a mapping of both the i830 and \ni850 samples illustrates a fairly even geographic distribution, with of course the expected \nconcentration around London. A comparison of the regional distribution with actual popu- \nlation figures for England in i83i and i851 suggests that the sample distributions appear to \nmatch the population figures relatively well. It should be noted, however, that in i830 the \nSoutheast (including London) and to a lesser extent the Midlands appear overrepresented, \nwhile the northern regions are underrepresented. For i85I the regions fairly accurately cor- \nrespond to the population figures. \nThis content downloaded from 158.143.192.135 on Wed, 16 Apr 2014 04:14:16 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\nREPEAL OF THE CORN LAWS 559 \nernment securities (consols, reduced annuities, etc.), (3) charges on real \nestate (including both absolute and annuity bequests charged on real es- \ntate holdings, and real estate sold whose value was then taxed), (4) cash \nbequests (from bank stock and monies from sources unspecified), and (5) \nresidue (which in many cases included the value of real estate property \nwhen instructions were given for its sale-the proceeds of which were \nthen subject to taxation). Unfortunately, real estate was not subject to \ndeath duty and subsequently was not valued until the early I850s. Vari- \nable (3) combined with variable (5) provides the best proxy for estimates \nof real estate, given the clear overlap between the two. \nAn examination of stockholdings by region and county illustrates the \ngeographic spread of capital market activity: whereas in i830 stockhold- \ners appeared in only four counties (all concentrated in London and the \nSouth), in i850 stockholders appeared in thirteen counties (spreading re- \ngionally from the Southeast and Southwest to include East Anglia, the \nMidlands, the Northeast and Northwest, and Wales). Moreover, the per- \ncentage of individuals owning stock increased from 3.7 percent in i830 \nto 12.5 percent in i850, also supporting the notion of an expanding cap- \nital market discussed earlier. \nThe second data source-income tax returns-also provides data on \nthe extent of diversification, but at the constituency level (that is, borough \nand county) and for the years I814 and i856. Although I814 and i856 \nwere not \"ideal\" years (ideal would have been i825 and i845), the lack \nof any income tax structure between i815 and i842 meant that i814 was \nthe latest possible year of the first period (excluding the unrepresentative \nfinal wartime tax year, i815).41 Further, i856 was chosen since it was the \nfirst year after reinstitution of the income tax that the Parliamentary \nPapers offer a complete county and borough breakdown for all the tax \nschedules. The two years are similar in that both were war years and \nboth operated under a virtually identical tax structure.42 \nIncome tax returns consisted of four schedules: Schedule A (profits \nfrom the ownership of lands, farm buildings, houses, tenements); Sched- \nule B (profits from the occupation of lands, houses, tenements-in short, \nprofits from farming); Schedule D (profits from trade or manufacturing \nbusiness, profession, employment, or vocation, and miscellaneous items \nsuch as foreign securities and possessions); and Schedule E (annuities, \n41 As it was the final year of the wartime income tax, returns in i815 dropped sharply due \nto public resistance to the tax and less stringent collection efforts by the Tax Office; see \nArthur Hope-Jones, Income Tax in the Napoleonic Wars (Cambridge: Cambridge University \nPress, 1939), 77, io9. Hence, I815 was not considered an appropriate year to sample. \n42 Ibid., i2i. \nThis content downloaded from 158.143.192.135 on Wed, 16 Apr 2014 04:14:16 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\n560 WORLD POLITICS \npensions, and stipends paid to holders of public office). An adjustment \nof the data43 enabled me to divide Schedule A into two parts, Ai and A2, \nwith the former comprising income from rural landownership and the \nlatter comprising income from urban landownership. \nTo determine whether or not M.P.'s from constituencies with greater \ndiversification were more likely to vote in favor of free trade, I con- \nstructed indexes of diversification for each sample. Individual scores \nwere averaged to obtain one score for each county in the death duty \nregister sample, whereas separate scores could be obtained for boroughs \nand counties in the income tax returns sample.44 Indexes used for both \nsamples are given in Table i. The first term in the death duty register \ndiversification index (stocks\/sum of all Xs) denotes the relative diversifi- \nTABLE I \nINDEXES OF DIVERSIFICATION \nDeath Duty Registers \nXl1 (X3 + X4) \nDiversification Index = \nSum x's Sum x's \nwhere \nXI = stocks and shares \nX2 = government securities \nX3 = charges on real estate \nX4 = residue \nX5 = cash, bank stock, money from unspecified sources \nIncome Tax Returns \nD Al \nDiversification Index = \n(for counties) Sum (A1,A2,B,D,E) Sum (A1,A2,B,D,E) \nDiversification Index = (D+A2) Al \n(for boroughs) Sum (Al,A2,B,D,E) Sum (Al,A2,B,D,E) \nwhere \nAl = income from rural landownership \nA2 = income from urban landownership \nB = income from farming \nD = income from trade, manufacture, etc. \nE = income from public office \n43Schonhardt-Bailey (fn. i), Appendix 2. \n44 Further on I separate the votes of M.P.'s into those representing boroughs and those \nrepresenting counties. For the death duty register sample, this means that, statistically speak- \ning, both sets of M.P.'s are responding to the same county-average diversification score. \nThis content downloaded from 158.143.192.135 on Wed, 16 Apr 2014 04:14:16 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\nREPEAL OF THE CORN LAWS 561 \ncation into stocks and shares, whereas the second term (charges on real \nestate + residue\/sum of all Xs)45 is the proxy for agricultural holdings.46 \nThe income tax returns diversification index follows the same approach; \nbut it broadens the scope of the first erm to include all profits from trade \nand manufacture, and for boroughs it also includes profits from urban \nlandownership. The second term isolates rural landowners as much as \npossible. The diversification indexes range from - i to + i; the higher \nthe score, the greater the diversification into stocks and shares (in the \ncase of the death duty registers), or the greater the diversification into \nthe broader array of nonagricultural ventures (in the case of the income \ntax returns). \nA final clarification regarding the diversification indexes should be \nmentioned. Since the possible scores range from - i (complete invest- \nment in land) to + i (complete investment in trade\/industry\/etc.), one \nmight surmise that the \"perfect,\" or best, score would be zero. This con- \nclusion might be warranted if one's argument were founded upon a non- \ndirectional diversification index, that is, one in which industrialists in- \nvesting in land created the same incentive for M.P.'s to vote for free trade \nas did landowners investing in industry. Such an index would presum- \nably require one to obtain the absolute values of each score and hypoth- \nesize a negative correlation between diversification and free-trade votes \n(where free trade = i and protectionism = o). In contrast, the argument \nhere-that landowners were seeking higher returns by investing in in- \ndustry-necessitates a directional index and hypothesizes a positive cor- \nrelation between diversification and votes for free trade. The higher the \nscore of a particular district, the greater the probability of its represen- \ntative M.P. voting for free trade.47 \n45 The real estate estimate for this sample suffers from various coding difficulties. Real \nestate, usually listed as \"charges thereupon\" rather than as actual values, creates distortion \ndue both to inflated values in some cases and to unreported values in others. It is possible \nthat these two distortions may have nullified each other, but without better microlevel data \nthe extent of the distortions is unknown. Moreover, real estate included not only agricultural \nholdings but also commercial property, and sometimes mining interests as well. Finally, \nwhile I include \"residue\" with real estate, not all the residue value could indeed be verified \nas real estate. The effect of these cross-cutting distortions in the estimate of real estate is, \nagain, unknown. \n46 Squaring both terms of the equation was considered but dismissed, since the result was \nan increased sensitivity to changes in income levels.

The former are simply the diversifica- \ntion scores for each sample year (i830 and i850 for the death duty reg- \nisters, and I814 and i856 for the income tax returns), while the latter \nsubtract the earlier year from the later year in order to obtain the change \nin each diversification score over time. \nTables 2 and 3 give results for all the diversification variables in a \nmultivariate probit model, using five separate parliamentary divisions on \nthe question of free trade. (The nature of each division is described in \nthe appendix; simply put, divisions i846a and i846b are most critical, as \nthe former is the first reading and the latter is the third reading of the \nrepeal legislation.) M.P. party identification, predicted district trade pref- \nerence (based on economic composition), and the effect of the i832 Re- \nform are included as control variables. I have explored the relationships \nbetween these variables and M.P. voting behavior on free trade in an \nearlier work;48 consequently, the discussion here is limited to the diver- \nsification variables. \nIn brief, positive coefficients and significance for the level diversifica- \ntion variables (Tables 2 and 3) lend firm support to the hypothesis that \nM.P.'s representing constituencies with greater diversification were more \nlikely to vote for free trade (that is, for repeal of the Corn Laws). The \nmore comprehensive sample of income tax returns provides much higher \nlevels of statistical significance than does the death duty sample. Never- \ntheless, obtaining as high as 95 percent significance (i846a) for such in- \ndividual-level historical data as death duties is encouraging. Both sam- \nples exhibit the same trend: each begins with weak significance for \ndiversification in i834 and strengthens in significance in i846, as one \nwould expect if diversification were increasing during the i83os and \nearly i 840s. \nResults for the difference variables (Tables 2 and 3) are far less \nstraightforward than those for the level variables. Interpretation of these \nresults draws upon earlier findings that established a classic urban-rural \nsplit between the voting behavior of borough and county M.P.'s, with the \nformer significantly more likely to support free trade than the latter.49 \nResults in Tables 2 and 3 are divided into subgroups of counties and \nboroughs in order to reveal the puzzling divergence between the two \nsamples. That is, in the death duty sample, county M.P.'s do not appear \nthat factor returns-as capital flows-will shift from low- to high-yield sectors of the econ- \nomy. \n48 Schonhardt-Bailey (fn. i), chap. 3. \n49 Ibid. \nThis content downloaded from 158.143.192.135 on Wed, 16 Apr 2014 04:14:16 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\nREPEAL OF THE CORN LAWS 563 \nto have responded to constituency diversification by voting for free trade, \nwhereas their borough counterparts do seem to have responded. The \nresults for the income tax returns reveal just the opposite trend: whereas \ncounty M.P.'s appear to have responded to constituency diversification \nwith a vote for free trade, borough M.P.'s do not seem to have responded \nlikewise. Before progressing further, it should be acknowledged that \ntests of statistical significance are unimpressive for both samples; inter- \npretation must accordingly be speculative (especially for divisions i842 \nand i846c, where only two M.P.'s from county constituencies voted for \nfree trade). Nevertheless, the relative internal consistency of both sets of \nresults and the partial statistical significance lead me to venture a specu- \nlative interpretation. \nRecalling that the death duty register sample measured solely the in- \ncome from stocks and shares as sources of diversification, we may inter- \npret the results in Table 2 to mean that the spread of stock market activ- \nity seemed to contribute to borough M.P.'s voting for repeal, but that this \none aspect of diversification was not sufficient o dissuade county M.P.'s \nfrom their protectionist stance. However, if diversification is measured \nmore broadly to include all trade and manufacture, as in the income tax \nreturns sample, then the magnitude of diversification does appear to af- \nfect the voting behavior of county M.P.'s. The obvious question is, why \ndid borough M.P.'s in the income tax returns ample not exhibit the same \npositive correlation? The answer simply put is that in both periods most \nboroughs were far more diversified into industry than were counties; \nthus, reduced but nevertheless till high diversification scores correlated \nnegatively with free-trade votes on the part of borough M.P.'s. (Strong \npositive correlations between diversification and free-trade votes for the \nlevel variables lend support to this interpretation.) A similar result did \nnot occur in the death duty register sample since (i) whole county aver- \nages were adopted for diversification indexes, rather than splitting \ncounty and borough constituencies, and (2) no doubt as a consequence of \nusing whole county averages, initial scores were virtually all very low. \nIn sum, while borough M.P.'s appeared more responsive than county \nM.P.'s to diversification by their constituents into stocks and shares, \ncounty M.P.'s (and probably also borough M.P.'s) did seem to respond to \nmore general diversification into trade and manufacture. Thus, for the \ndifference variables, the type of diversification (specific, as in stocks, ver- \nsus general, as in trade and manufacture) and the type of constituency \nrepresented (borough versus county) must be considered if the hypothesis \nof diversification is to be sustained. \nThis content downloaded from 158.143.192.135 on Wed, 16 Apr 2014 04:14:16 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\nTABLE 2 \nDEATH DUTY REGISTER SAMPLE: PROBIT RESULTS FOR LEVEL AND DIFFERENCE VARIABLESa \nAll Constituencies Counties Boroughs \nLevel Number of Difference Number of Number of \nDivision Coefficientsb (t-ratio) Cases Coefficientsb (t-ratio) Cases (t-ratio) Cases \n1834 Constant -4.38 (-7.42)f 341 Constant -10.39 (-1.25) 86 -4.21 (-6.85)f 218 \nBI DIVS23CO 0.24 (0.94) B1 DIVSDIF2 -0.14 (-0.28) -0.13 (-0.50) \nB2 DIV2PID 0.81 (6.28)f B2 DIV2PID 1.61 (0.88) 0.77 (5.59)f \nB3 DISTPREF 0.33 (7.68)f B3 DISTPREF 0.66 (3.78)f 0.20 (3.72)f \nB4 REFCHNG 0.24 (2.92)f B4 REFCHNG 0.81 (0.85) 0.30 (3.39)f \n1842 Constant -8.66 (- 4.16)f 326 Constant -7.85 (-0.04) 95 -8.90 (- 3.93)f 193 \nBI DIVS25CO 0.56 (1.26) B1 DIVSDIF2 -0.72 (-0.72) 0.48 (1.26) \nB2 DIV3PID 1.94 (3.92)f B2 DIV3PID 2.52 (0.40) 1.93 (3.58)f \nB3 DISTPREF 0.30 (3.95)f B3 DISTPREF 0.25 (0.67) 0.25 (2.75)f \nB4 REFCHNG 0.25 (1.87)d B4 REFCHNG -0.82 (-0.02) 0.29 (l.94)d \n1846a Constant -2.22 (-4.74)f 372 Constant -2.85 (-0.86) 98 -3.11 (-4.78)f 234 \nB1 DIVS25CO 0.67 (2.25)e B1 DIVSDIF2 -0.13 (-0.28) 039 (1.36)c \nB2 DIV4PID 1.13 (10.52)f B2 DIV4PID 1.19 (5.06)f 1.05 (7.58)f \nB3 DISTPREF 0.25 (4.70)f B3 DISTPREF 0.34 (2.11)' 0.08 (1.14) \nB4 REFCHNG -0.08 (-0.72) B4 REFCHNG -0.17 (-0.21) 0.28 (1.63)c \n1846b Constant -2.21 (- 4.66)f 367 Constant -2.58 (-0.69) 95 -3.29 (- 4.62)f 234 \nB1 DIVS25CO 0.56 (1.88)d B1 DIVSDIF2 -0.74 (- 1.36)' 0.48 (1.65)d \nB2 DIV6PID 1.15 (10.30)f B2 DIV6PID 1.38 (4.82)f 1.05 (7.34)f \nB3 DISTPREF 0.26 (4.69)f B3 DISTPREF 0.38 (1.85)d 0.06 (0.81) \nB4 REFCHNG -0.10 (-0.95) B4 REFCHNG -0.40 (-0.42) 0.37 (1.95)d \nThis content downloaded from 158.143.192.135 on Wed, 16 Apr 2014 04:14:16 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\n1846c Constant -4.15 (-6.68)f 235 Constant -7.18 (-0.03) 59 -4.03 (-6.65)f 154 \nB1 DIVS25CO 0.55 (1.28)c Bi DIVSDIF2 0.02 (0.02) 0.17 (0.48) \nB2 DIV7PID 0.99 (6.84)f B2 DIV7PID 2.68 (0.40) 0.88 (5.71)f \nB3 DISTPREF 0.10 (1.71)d B3 DISTPREF 0.15 (0.43) 0.04 (0.53) \nB4 REFCHNG 0.10 (0.99) B4 REFCHNG -1.07 (-0.02) 0.16 (1.50)c \naProbability of free-trade vote = A + BI (diversification fconstituents' income) + B2 (M.P. party ID) + B3 (predicted trade preference of \nM.P. constituency district) + B4 (effect of i832 Reform on district). \nb DIVS23CO gives the diversification scores for the I83O death duty register sample, averaged for each county;

I argue that the driving force behind the diversification \nof the asset portfolios of landowners was the rapidly emerging capital \nmarket, evidenced in the i83os by the spread of stock market activity \nthroughout Britain. I attempt to prove that the apparent difficulty in \nreconciling conventional applications of the specific factors model with \nthe decision of M.P.'s to repeal the Corn Laws can be overcome by \nswitching from a model based on a measurement of the asset stocks of \nvoters to one that incorporates the corollary of industrialization, namely, \nthe diversification of factor returns from land rents into higher yield \nindustrial capital. This makes a model based on income flows rather than \non capital stocks a more meaningful tool. \nThe results at both the individual and the aggregate level reported in \nthis paper indicate that as landowners diversified into industry, the po- \nlitical benefits accruing to M.P.'s from maintaining protection in agri- \nculture diminished. M.P.'s from districts that were more diversified \naway from agriculture were more likely to vote in favor of free trade \nthan were those from less diversified districts. In turn, the diversification \nof districts was a measure of the degree to which individual voters were \nacquiring a range of specific interests that were focused less on agricul- \ntural rents. Thus, there was a lessening of the incentives for M.P.'s to \ndefend the Corn Laws and a decisive policy shift by Britain toward lib- \neralization of trade. \nEarly industrializers uch as Britain and the U.S. mobilized capital in \nsmaller units, since the average scale of each business was smaller than it \nwas for later industrializers. In Britain, the combination of a large role \nfor direct investment (in the form of ownership of industrial production \nby landowners) and the early development of securities markets enabled \nprofit-maximizing landowners to switch directly into industrial invest- \nment. It is the hypothesis of this paper that such direct ownership of \nindustrial capital was an important factor in changing the trade prefer- \nences of landowners. Turning to cases of later industrialization (for ex- \nample, Germany and Japan) in which larger sums of initial capital in- \nvestment were required, the dominant actors responsible for managing \nthe flow of investment capital were banks. The requirement for larger \nsums of investment capital created a role for banks as providers and \nthereby limited the direct involvement of landowners in the diversifica- \ntion of their portfolios (though this does not provide an explanation for \nwhy in some countries banks rather than securities markets were the \nThis content downloaded from 158.143.192.135 on Wed, 16 Apr 2014 04:14:16 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\nREPEAL OF THE CORN LAWS 569 \nmajor source of capital-raising activity). Landowners were able to invest \nin banks whose role was to mobilize the capital needed for larger units \nof production and that could pool the risks to an extent that could no \nlonger be done by individuals investing directly. This paper has found a \nlink between direct investment in industrial capital and a change in trade \npolicy preferences; however, where the investment link is indirect, via a \nbank that pools risk by spreading its assets across economic sectors, it is \nmore likely that the trade preferences of asset holders will be more \nweakly specified. \nAPPENDIX \nPARLIAMENTARY DIVISIONS \n1826. Mr. W. Whitmore's motion for the consideration of free trade in \ncorn (April i8, i826): ayes = 8i; noes = 250. (Division included only \nthe minority M.P.'s and of these, only 65 could be identified by district.) \n1834. Mr. Hume's motion for a committee on the Corn Laws (March 6, \nI834). This was the first motion on the Corn Laws to be brought forth \nin the reformed Parliament: ayes = i55; noes = 3I2. (Two M.P.'s vot- \ning no could not be identified by district.) \n1842. Mr. Villier's motion to abolish all the duties on corn (February 24, \ni842): ayes = go; noes = 393. (Two M.P.'s voting no could not be iden- \ntified by district.) \ni846(a). Mr. P. Mile's amendment to delay the House going into com- \nmittee to consider the Corn laws by six months (thus forcing a vote on \nPeel's motion that the House immediately resolve itself into a committee \nof the whole, i.e., Peel's first reading of the Corn Law Repeal) (February \n27, i846): ayes = 337; noes = 240. (One M.P. voting aye could not be \nidentified by district.) \ni846(b). Mr. Peel's motion to repeal the Corn Laws, third reading (May \ni5, i846): ayes = 327; noes = 229. (All M.P.'s identified by district.) \ni846(c). Mr. Villier's amendment calling for total and immediate repeal \nof the Corn Laws (versus the gradualist nature of Peel's motion, with \ncomplete abolition of duties in i849) (March 6, i846). The House divided \non the question that Peel's motion retain the I849 date: ayes = 265; noes \n= 78. (Ayes coded as a vote for protection, and noes coded as a vote for \nfree trade. Districts of two M.P.'s were questionable but were coded ac- \ncording to my best guess estimate.) \nThis content downloaded from 158.143.192.135 on Wed, 16 Apr 2014 04:14:16 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\n"}
