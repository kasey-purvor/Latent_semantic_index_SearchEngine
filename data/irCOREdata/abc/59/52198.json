The method of \ncreation of contemporary jewellery pieces and the resultant \u2018Ocular\u2019 jewellery series are \ndescribed from the points of view of an artist and an engineer. The work demonstrates \nhow laser controlled oxide growth on commercially pure titanium under ambient \nconditions can be used as an artistic tool by producing even, defined colours or by \nreproducing a simulation of freehand drawings on a titanium surface. It also asks the \nquestion: how different are artists from scientists and engineers? \nKeywords: jewellery, art, laser, titanium oxide \n 2\n1. Introduction \nThe nature of an artist is one of enquiry and investigation. By continually looking for answers to the self-\ninflicted problems of design and execution, they experiment with and exploit the materials until they yield \ninto place [1]. The search continues as outcomes often prove unsatisfactory. An extraordinary \nunderstanding of materials through years of research is gained in this way, making applied artists heavily \nresponsible for the direct implementation of this knowledge. The accumulated material knowledge is \napplied together with much underrated practical expertise to create three-dimensional artefacts with \nawesome results [2]. <1st author> \nThe nature of a (research) engineer or scientist is one of seeking to understand and advance in a never \nending cycle. Analysis is one dimension of their work, but the creation of a new process, protein, part, \nassembly, building, mathematical model or any other advancement all requires engineers and scientists to \nthink beyond the purely analytical. For example, a turbine engine requires immense amounts of testing, \nanalysis and painstaking assembly down to the tiniest detail, but who would argue that Frank Whittle and \nother pioneers of this technology were not men or extraordinary creativity and imagination? [3]. <2nd \nauthor> \nIt is easy to make superficial generalisations about either culture, but the lateral thought process that artists \nare renowned for is quite often the gateway that opens new territory and applications for emerging \ntechnologies. The work of Lynne Murray RCA with rapid prototyping [8] is a good example of this. A \nlanguage that can be understood by the non-expert [4] helps to demystify the technology by bringing inside \ninformation out to new audiences, encouraging hybrid practices that can be extraordinary fruitful [5]. \nThe work carried out in this research uses this dialogue and laser technology to create artefacts that prove \nthe success of the art \/ engineering and art \/ science partnerships. Currently, it is rare to have this symbiotic \nstate emerge as jewellery; far more common are the links made to science with fine art, photography and \ndigital art [6,7]. \n2. Artistic and Scientific Techniques \n2.1. Artistic Perspective \n2.1.1 Background \nThe first author and contemporary jewellery artist Sarah O\u2019Hana. has specialised in the promotion, support \nand implementation of new digital technologies, in particular laser processing, for the applied arts in the \nNorth West, UK. After initiating the only Professional Development Qualification (PDQ) that addressed \nthese issues in the UK, she curated the resulting exhibition of 14 artists called In the Making [9], launched \nin the headquarters of Foment de les Arts Decoratives (FAD), Barcelona. This groundbreaking exhibition \nand resulting round table discussion \u2018Iniciatives de recolzament i projecci\u00f3 per a joves artistes i \ndissenyadors\u2019 caused the current research to be carried out into laser processing for the creative industries \nat The University of Manchester.  \nJewellery and objects in response to this research are predominantly made with laser coloured titanium \nsurfaces. They have been exhibited at Heirlooms (St Botolphs Church, London) [10] as part of the \nAssociation for Contemporary Jewellery\u2019s (ACJ) conference of  \u201cCarry the Can\u201d in London, July 2006. \nRecent work will be shown at Walking with Scientists in The Museum of Manchester, UK [11], 30th June \n\u2013 2nd September 2007. Jewellery is unique within the design and visual arts in its demand to be \u2018finished\u2019 \nas a predominantly wearable art form; skill and ability in the making are important, even if the final \naesthetic is chosen to be \u2018rough\u2019 or \u2018unfinished\u2019. Observation of the everyday affects the final work. \nEngineering components, conversations with scientists or engineers, experiments by other researchers and \nthe whole environment of life in the laboratory works its way, often subconsciously, into the design \nprocess. \n 3\n2.1.2 Current Work \nThe finished series of three-dimensional work described in this paper is the Ocular Series 1-6. This series is \nbased on the aesthetic of optical measuring equipment and relates to concepts of vision: \u2018seeing the bigger \npicture\u2019, \u2018clouded vision\u2019, \u2018seeing through tinted glasses\u2019, \u2018blurred vision\u2019.... all expressions used in the \nEnglish language that are linked to the problems of not seeing correctly because of an impediment, be it \nphysical or psychological. Background research was done for this work in the area of optometry and the \nmeasuring systems that exist there in order to understand the process of eyesight correction which is also \nlinked to a personal lifelong condition of hyperopia and astigmatism. Trays of optician\u2019s trial lenses \nincluding prisms and frames were acquired with the intention of creating a range of work based on seeing, \nobserving, peering and clarifying vision. This is an analogy for the deficient situation existing between art \nand engineering that appears short sighted despite the current popular discussions that, interestingly, are \nusually initiated by the art and design culture. \nThe pieces include some unique features including fingerprints, marked by laser onto the acrylic portions of \nthe pieces. These were included to add a dimension that simulates the reduction of distance between artist \nand workpiece, a concern rising from the increased use of digital technology that drives the laser. \nDirect contact with material is important for the understanding of its properties [12], and drawing has \nbecome a prime ingredient that helps balance the regular shapes that appear on some pieces. In the attempt \nto render the technology transparent a more direct \u2018freehand\u2019 approach to laser processing is called for. \nDrawing is understanding and helps feed creativity. The link between drawing and making within the \njewellery practice is perhaps obvious, although not always linear or calculated. \n2.2. Engineering Perspective \nIn order to meet the requirements for the series is was necessary to be able to produce defined colours and \nrecreate hand drawn shapes to predefined geometries on both sides of pieces of commercial titanium. \n2.2.1 Background \nTraditionally, a spectrum of colours can be achieved on titanium either by applying heat using traditional \nmethods such as gas torches or more commonly by electrolytic oxidation (anodising). A titanium \nworkpiece is immersed in an electrolytic solution as an anode and current is drawn. Oxygen generated at \nthe anodic surface then combines with the titanium to form titanium oxide. As the oxide thickens it \nincreasingly acts as an electrical insulator between the electrolyte and the anode until the point where there \nare too few OH- ions available to support further growth, The oxide thickness at which this occurs is \nprimarily a function of the applied voltage but there have been a large number of studies on the properties \nof the oxide films [13-16], which have showed that the composition and microstructure of the anodic \noxides are also strongly dependent on other factors such as electrolyte concentration, temperature and \nanodic surface conditions [17]. This means there are a lot of variables to control for an artist. Additionally \nthe technique requires a high power supply and hazardous electrolytic bath and masking is difficult \nespecially when detailed two-sided parts are to be created, as in this case. \nThe surface appearance of the workpiece after anodizing is due to the formation of a titanium oxide layer. \nInterference between light reflecting from the surfaces of the metal and oxide coating can be constructive \nor destructive as particular wavelengths depending on the oxide film thickness, meaning the frequencies of \nlight reflected become a function of that thickness [16]. The oxide films grown on reactive metals in \ngeneral have a higher refractive index than diamond which accounts for the brilliance of the colours seen. \nLangdale et al [18] treated commercially pure titanium with a pulsed Nd:YAG laser (2-17 kHz frequency, \n2-50 mm\/s traverse speed) in ambient air. The authors found a range of titanium oxides and concluded that \nalthough the layer thickness may have an effect, the different colours they observed corresponded to \ndifferent titanium oxides. A similar study by Perez del Pino et al [19] (Nd:YAG laser, 30 kHz frequency, \n56.7 W mean power, 25-300 mm\/s) confirmed these results; additionally a greater range of oxides was \nfound to form at higher specific energies. However, a later study by the same authors [20], comparing the \ncolours obtained from anodizing and laser treating titanium, concluded that light interference phenomena \nwithin an upper TiO2 surface layer were the mechanism in both cases. The additional oxides created during \nlaser treatment were said to be part of a deeper layer which was not significant for appearance. Carey et al \n 4\n[21] drew attention to the potential of lasers in the Jewellery industry, but Bartlett noted the unpredictability \nof the evenness of colours developed in this way, attributing it to \u2018flower oxides\u2019 [17]. \n2.2.2 Current Work \nThe base material was commercially pure titanium plate; it was initially cut into the required shape for the \nfinal piece using a 35W Nd:YAG laser (100ns, 680mJ pulses at 20Hz pulse frequency) with argon gas \nshroud. The shaped piece was then placed on a honeycombed bed and a Universal X-660 Laser Platform \nfitted with a pulsed 60W CO2 laser used to treat the surface. This free-standing unit comprises the laser, an \nX-Y beam positioning system with 0.81 \u00d7 0.46 m work area, interchangeable focussing optics and \ncomputer interface. The laser beam was focussed by a 2.0\u201d (50mm) focal length lens in an enclosed lens \ncartridge to a spot of diameter 0.15 mm at the workpiece. The pulse frequency was varied in proportion to \nspeed in order to maintain a constant spatial distribution of pulses on the surface; for this work it was set at \n1000 pulses \/ dots per inch.  \nIn order for artistic designs to be created on the workpiece by the system two different control methods \nwere used. \n\u2022 Where an area of even, predefined colour was required, the laser scanning parameters and area were \npre-programmed with the help of Adobe Illustrator and Corel Draw software packages. A series of \nparallel beam traces performed in a raster pattern on the required area in ambient air was then used to \nform a titanium oxide film on the surface. The relationship between the laser parameters and final \ncolour were obtained through experience. Existing literature in the field can provide a guide but many \nfactors are difficult to predict. For example the specific energy parameters used by P\u00e9rez del Pino et al \n[19,20]and Fedenev et al [22] to produce comparable results differed by orders of magnitude because \nof different surface absorptivity, heat conduction at the workpiece and other effects pointed out by \nFedenev et al. \n\u2022 Where rapidly varying colour was required, the same CO2 laser was driven by a bitmap obtained from \na digital graphics package such or scanned drawing. The intensity of laser flux delivered to the \nworkpiece surface at each position was based on the bitmap. The resulting marks on the titanium \nsurface replicated the original drawing and appeared to have been applied by hand quite \nspontaneously. The exact colours obtained were however less predictable than those obtained by the \nformer method. \nAfter completion of a part, surfaces were tested by non-destructive methods. The samples were \nphotographed under natural light using a Canon EOS digital camera set to maximum resolution. Images \nwith no colour correction were transferred directly to microcomputer and treated areas analysed using \nAdobe Photoshop software for colour balance. This is a considerably simpler method of characterising the \nsurface appearance than the spectrophotometry-based techniques used by previous researchers, but as the \nrelationship between visible appearance and TiO2 layer thickness is now well established [20,23] it was not \nnecessary to repeat that analysis. The surface produced by one set of laser parameters was also tested for \nphase composition with a Phillips X-Pert MPD diffractometer using Cu K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb = 1.54 A) \nmeasuring using a thin film method. The incidence angle was approximately 0.7\u00b0. \n3. Results and Discussion \n3.1. Artistic Perspective \nFigure 1 shows Ocular no 5. This object was made with the intention to hold rather than wear. Thumb and \nindex finger prints of the author\u2019s have been marked onto acrylic holding points, directly informing the \nviewer about where to hold the piece. The lens, reclaimed from a camera, distorts the vision. The colours \nand order of the pattern applied are the author\u2019s aesthetic choice which are based, as all this work, on the \noriginal experiments done by CO2 laser on the titanium. Figure 2 shows the laser process parameters used \nto produce the upper and lower surfaces of this  piece. \n 5\n \nFigure 1: Ocular no. 5.  The colour visible on the titanium is controlled by different laser parameters \nshown in Figure 2 \n \n \nFigure 2: Laser parameters for Ocular Series no. 5. (power and speed are given as a % of the maximums \nof 60 W and mm\/s repectively) \n \nFigure 3 shows Ocular 2, containing a square lens. The author\u2019s thumbprints and other fingerprints are an \nimportant feature of this piece. Prints were taken using indelible ink then scanned. Various techniques in \nPhotoshop were then used to manipulate the resulting image with added text in layers that were sent \nthrough to the laser for marking in different stages. The position of the fingerprints indicates the manner in \nwhich the viewer should hold the piece to look through the lens which has also been recovered from a \ncamera and greatly distorts the view. \n 6\n \nFigure 3: Ocular Series no. 2.  The colour visible on the titanium is controlled by different laser \nparameters shown in Figure 2 \n \nFigure 4 shows Ocular 3, with chain and random marking. The design for this piece is grounded in the \naesthetic of instruments used for optical measuring as well as in a fundamental need to get away from the \npredictable digital appearance of laser processed work. For this reason the marks are taken directly from \noriginal drawings which were scanned into digital form (Figure 5). This is an important strand of on-going \npractice as it is essential to understand form, shape and colour. For a maker of objects this is logical \nalthough the link between drawing and making is obvious but not always straightforward and linear. The \nsimultaneous advance of the multi-stranded animal that is art practice is in constant evolution. It is a \nquestion of harnessing the resulting energy into considered shape and form. \n \nFigure 4: Ocular Series no 3.

Engineering Perspective \nThe range of colours created on the titanium surface in Ocular mo. 5 were analysed as described in section \n2.1. Results of the optical analysis are shown in Tables 1 (constant speed, variable power) and Table 2 \n(variable speed, constant power). \nTable 1.

The four significant phases highlighted were \nhexagonal \u03b1-Ti, cubic TiO, tetragonal rutile TiO2 and hexagonal Ti2O titanium oxides. The reference peak \npositions of these phases are shown on separate spectra for clarity. \nPeaks corresponding to the underlying \u03b1-Ti are very strong, evidencing the very thin nature of the surface \nlayer that had developed. They also provide an almost perfect match to reference angles of diffraction \ngiving good confidence in the accuracy of the measurements. There is evidence for the presence of TiO, \nalthough as can be seen from Figure 6(b), the diffraction peaks are smaller than the reference values by \nincreasing amounts on moving from left to right. This indicates a slightly larger lattice parameter than \nexpected which could have been caused by a gradual transition between phases. Indeed, it can be seen that \na number of the peaks are quite broad which can be indication of a graded phase structure. \nRutile TiO2, which is normally obtained at high temperatures such as 800\u00b0C, and held by most authors to be \nresponsible for the interference colours seen on the surfaces is clearly present. Gyorgy et al [24] concluded \nthat during pulsed (300 ns) Nd:YAG laser irradiation of Ti under ambient conditions, oxidation proceeds \nfrom TiO present in the early stage of the irradiation, through Ti2O3, until the formation of the TiO2 rutile \nphase at high number of pulses. In this case each part of the surface received only 6 pulses (1000 dpi \nsurface coverage, spot diameter 0.15 mm) so it is likely another mechanism was responsible for this phase. \nNo Ti2O3 or anatase TiO2 was detected in this investigation. \nThe third oxide found was the hexagonal Ti2O titanium oxide. This is of the same lattice structure as the \nunderlying \u03b1-Ti and probably formed lower in the surface layer, partly integrated with it. In all the XRD \n 8\nresults are in agreement with the theory of a graded surface layer progressing from an outer layer of TiO2 to \nlower layers of more Ti rich oxides [20]. \n \n \nFigure 6: Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction spectrum from the surface of a laser treated titanium sample \n(60 W, 100 mm\/s) \n \n4. Conclusion \nA moderate power (60 W), pulsed CO2 laser directed via an X-Y beam positioning system within an \nintegrated system and interfaced with commercial graphics software has been found a very efficient tool for \ncreation of controlled and even areas of colour and of designs that appear spontaneous on the surface of \ncommercial purity Titanium plate. Rutile nitrogen oxide, TiO2, usually considered to form an outer surface \nlayer and be responsible for interference colours, plus TiO and Ti2O titanium oxides were detected on the \nsurface. Results are consistent with the theory of a graded surface layer progressing from an outer layer of \nTiO2 to lower layers of more Ti rich oxides. \nThe artefacts shown in this paper are an illustration of how the tools and techniques used by researchers in \nscience and engineering can be adopted by the creative industries. The exhibition at The Manchester \n 9\nMuseum that this paper accompanies is also a demonstration of how art can help the public understanding \nof a particular discipline that can seem remote and alien. An alloy of two different cultures has been \nreached by mutual collaboration, demonstrating how both stand to gain much from each other. \n5.
