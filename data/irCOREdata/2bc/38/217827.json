Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\nB A C K G R O U N D\nDescription of the condition\nSuicide rates\nFigures on suicide rates are much debated, with many authors sug-\ngesting significant underreporting of suicides, in some cases for\ncultural or religious reasons (La Vecchia 1994). It has been sug-\ngested that there may be even greater underreporting or misclas-\nsification in the case of young people (Wasserman 2005). Mean\nsuicide rates for 15-19-year-olds for the 90 countries who pro-\nvided data to the World Health Organisation are 10.5\/100,000\nfor males and 4.1\/100,000 for females, for the most recent year\navailable (7.4 overall). Suicide accounted for 9.1% of deaths in\nthis age group. Only accidents and assault come higher in causes\nof death in the 15-19 age group (Wasserman 2005). Globally there\nhas been a rising trend in suicide rates for young males from 1950,\nthis rise being particularly marked before 1980, and in countries\noutside Europe, while rates for females have remained fairly con-\nstant. Suicide rates in western Europe and North America have\ndeclined in recent years. It has been suggested that the decline is\nlinked to the increased use of antidepressants being prescribed to\nadolescents during this period (Gould 2003). Rates for completed\nsuicides rise markedly in the late teens and continue to rise until\nthe early twenties after which they remain similar until the sixth\ndecade (Gould 2003).\nSuicide attempts are much more common than completed sui-\ncides, and rates of completed suicide and attempted suicide are\npositively related (Hawton 1998), making attempted suicide a risk\nfactor for completed suicide (Kerkhof 2000). Accurate national\nstatistics are unavailable (De Wilde 2002), however, a 1999 sur-\nvey in the US found that 1 in 12 young people said they had\nattempted suicide (Grunbaum 2001). Evans et al ( Evans 2004)\nreport that epidemiological surveys of adolescents suggest suicidal\nphenomena (suicide attempts, deliberate self-harm, and suicidal\nplans, threats and thoughts) are underreported. Unlike completed\nsuicides, suicide attempts aremore common among young females\nthan young males, and peak between 16 and 18 years of age, af-\nter which there is a marked decline, especially for females (Gould\n2003).\nRisk factors\/ causes\nThe multiple causes of suicidal behaviour can be divided into\nproximal stressors or triggers on the one hand and predisposition,\nor factors associated with vulnerability to suicidal behaviour, on\nthe other (Evans 2004; Mann 2005).\nEvans 2004 conducted a systematic review of studies investigating\nfactors associated with suicidal phenomena in adolescents. The\nevidence was drawn from population-based studies of young peo-\nple who had answered self-report questionnaire or interview ques-\ntions about suicidal phenomena, where the studies had reported\na prevalence figure for suicidal phenomena. There was strong ev-\nidence of an association with suicidal phenomena for family sui-\ncidal behaviour, a vulnerability factor, and for the stress factors of\ndepression, alcohol abuse, use of hard drugs, mental health prob-\nlems, suicidal behaviour by friends, family discord (especially for\nfemales) and poor peer relationships. There was also strong evi-\ndence of an association with living apart from parents, antisocial\nbehaviour (especially in females), sexual abuse, physical abuse and\nunsupportive parents, which appeared as both vulnerability and\nstress factors. In addition, there was evidence suggestive of an as-\nsociation with poor communication within the family as a vul-\nnerability factor and with hopelessness, eating disorders, smoking,\ndrug use, sleep difficulties and media exposure to suicide as stres-\nsors. There were further possible associations with low self-esteem,\npoor physical health, physical disability and sexual activity.\nDefinitions\nA large number of different terms are used in discussing suicide\nand suicidal behaviour. Here, following Fox and Hawton (Fox\n2004), suicidal behaviour encompasses any form of intentional\nor deliberate self-injurious behaviour (suicide, attempted suicide,\ndeliberate self-harm). This includes fatal outcomes but the term\nsuicide will be used to refer only to self-injurious behaviour with\na fatal outcome. Deliberate self-harm will refer to self-injurious\nbehaviour with non-fatal outcome.\nDescription of the intervention\nThe various types of prevention programmes can be grouped into\nthree main settings in which they operate: school, community and\nhealth-care systems (Gould 2003). The ultimate intended goal\nof the interventions is the prevention of adolescent suicide. The\ngeneral goals of prevention programmes are usually either or both\nof 1) case finding with accompanying referral and treatment or\n2) risk factor reduction (CDC 1994; Gould 2003; Gould 2001).\nSome programmes will have other goals, such as the promotion\nof good mental health and prevention of the onset of risk factors\nsuch as depression.\nSchool-based interventions\nKalafat (Kalafat 2003) divides these into universal (given to ev-\neryone), selective (given to groups exposed to certain risk factors)\nand indicated interventions (given to specific individuals who have\nbeen identified through screening procedures as being at preclin-\nical levels of a disorder).\nThe curriculum-based prevention programmes attempt to de-em-\nphasise the link with mental illness in order to de-stigmatise sui-\ncidal feelings. One aim of these programmes is often to enable\nstudents to recognise peers at risk of suicidal behaviour and make\nstudents aware of where they can get help. However, there is a\nrisk that the programmes normalise suicidal behaviour, reducing\npotentially protective taboos (Fox 2004). Harden et al (Harden\n2001) found some evidence that discussing suicide may encourage\nsome to consider it. In Guo and Harstell\u2019s review (Guo 2002), two\n2Prevention of suicide and suicidal behaviour in adolescents (Protocol)\nCopyright \u00a9 2008 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\nstudies suggested some young people were more likely to commit\nsuicide after school-based prevention programmes.\nThese programmes have been quite widespread in the US. The\nevidence of a possibility of negative effects prompted a turn to-\nwards skills-based programmes that aim to develop problem-solv-\ning, coping and cognitive skills, the rationale being that suicidal\nyouths have deficits in these areas and that enhancing these pro-\ntective factors will reduce the risk of suicide attempts. Targeted\noutcomes of these programmes include suicide risk factors such as\ndepression, hopelessness, and drug abuse. There have been some\npromising findings from evaluations of these programmes (Gould\n2003).\nScreening, gatekeeper training (to help school personnel identify\nat-risk youths) and peer helper programmes aim to discreetly iden-\ntify at-risk individuals who might need to be referred for treat-\nment or further evaluation. Screening programmes use self-report\nand individual interviews and have been found to yield few false-\nnegatives but many false-positives (Gould 2003:395). It is argued\nthat a tolerance of false positives is essential to help avoid missing\na suicidal individual (Thompson 1999). The use of peer helpers is\nbased on the premise that suicidal youths are more likely to con-\nfide in a peer than an adult. Activities of peer helpers range from\nreporting of warning signs to counselling. There are also postven-\ntion\/crisis interventions that are implemented after the suicide of\na peer, a time of increased risk of suicide. The rationale for these\nprogrammes is that a timely targeted response will reduce subse-\nquent morbidity and mortality.\nCommunity-based prevention programmes\nCrisis intervention centres and hotlines can provide immediate\nsupport at times of crisis. Suicidal behaviour is often associated\nwith a crisis situation and research has indicated that such cen-\ntres do attract high-risk populations (Dew 1987), but it remains\nunclear whether they reduce suicide rates in the communities in\nwhich they are located.\nSome programmes, such as weapons control, aim to restrict the\nmeans of suicide. The rationale is based on the frequently impul-\nsive nature of the suicide act and the transience of the risk period.\nHowever, there is little sign that these programmes have any effect\non suicide rates (Fox 2004).\nIt has been suggested that there are risks associated with report-\ning of suicide in the media (Evans 2004), and that an increase in\npositive suicide models put forward by the media has led to in-\ncreased suicidal behaviour in adolescents (Diekstra 1995). There-\nfore, media education programmes aim to encourage a responsible\nattitude towards media reporting of suicides. There are guidelines\nfor newspaper reporting in many countries, for example, to keep\nsuicide off the front pages and describe treatment resources in re-\nports.\nHealth-care based prevention programmes\nInterventions aimed at primary care health workers are designed\nto increase identification of at-risk youth. Many suicidal young\npeople seek medical care in the month before their suicide (Pfaff\n1999), although these rates (estimates range between 7 and 20%\n(Gould 2003)) aremuch lower than for adults (Mann2005). There\nis some evidence that training medical practitioners may lead to\nincreased identification of suicidal patients (Gould 2003). A sys-\ntematic review (Mann 2005) concluded that physician education\nin depression recognition and treatment and restricting access to\nlethal methods reduces suicide rates.\nPrevention programmes in other institutions\nThis review will also look at strategies for preventing suicide in\nother institutions such as those for young offenders. As well as\ninterventions named above such strategies may include screening,\nclose observation, removal of lethal means and structures which\ncould be used for hanging, avoidance of solitary housing and the\ntraining of staff to recognise signs of risk (Nock 2000).\nExisting reviews of suicide prevention programmes\nThere are a number of existing reviews of suicide prevention pro-\ngrammes which have reported evidence of both harm and benefit.\nIn general, insufficient evidence was found to support particular\napproaches to suicide prevention.\nA systematic review of suicide prevention strategies by Mann et al\n(Mann 2005) found two systematic reviews and four randomised\ncontrolled trials (RCTs) of curriculum-based programmes for ado-\nlescents. The review searched Medline, Cochrane and Psychinfo\nbetween 1966 and 2005.\nA review of research on suicide prevention programmes for chil-\ndren and youth published between 1990 and 2002 was carried out\nby Guo and Harstall ( Guo 2002) and included a broader range of\nresearch designs. All the included studies looked at school-based\nprevention programmes. The reviewers found increases in knowl-\nedge and improved attitudes to mental illness and suicide but in-\nsufficient evidence of effect on suicidal behaviour.\nPloeg et al (Ploeg 1999) reviewed studies on adolescent suicide\nprevention published between 1980-1995 and updated the review\nin 1999 with a focus on school-based programmes. They found\nevidence of improved knowledge but there were both beneficial\nand harmful effects in terms of help-seeking, attitudes, and peer\nsupport.\nGould et al (Gould 2003) conducted a review of the previous ten\nyears of research on youth suicide risk and preventive interven-\ntions. A comprehensive, but not exhaustive, search was made of\nMedline, Psycinfo, ERIC and Education Full Text. The review\nconcluded that there was insufficient evidence on the effective-\nness of school-based suicide awareness programmes, peer support\nprogrammes or problem-solving and coping skills development\ncourses. Limited evidence was found to support training of school\n3Prevention of suicide and suicidal behaviour in adolescents (Protocol)\nCopyright \u00a9 2008 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\nstaff to recognise students at risk of suicide, and crisis intervention\nafter a suicide to reduce risk of subsequent suicides in peers.\nWhy it is important to do this review\nSuicide prevention programmes are being implemented in schools.\nIn the US many states require or recommend that suicide pre-\nvention programmes are carried out. It is necessary to find out if\nany harm is caused by these interventions, and, given the limited\nresources available to schools, and the wide range of interventions\navailable to them, to find out whether there are any positive effects\nof the interventions and what these might be. In addition, it may\nbe possible to determine which features of interventions are most\nsuccessful, leading to the possibility of recommendations for fu-\nture programme development. It is very possible that some of the\nmost at-risk young people will not be attending school and that\ncommunity or health-care based programmes may be more likely\nto reach these young people. In order tomake best use of resources,\nit is important to try to ascertain which components of suicide\nprevention programmes are effective for adolescents. The current\nreview is intended to provide an exhaustive search and analysis of\nthe available evidence bringing together findings from a variety of\ndifferent, but interrelated, interventions.\nO B J E C T I V E S\n1.

To highlight areas where further research is most needed\nM E T H O D S\nCriteria for considering studies for this review\nTypes of studies\nRandomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster randomised trials\nand quasi-randomised controlled trials (e.g. sequential allocation\nby class or school) will be included.\nIt is possible that very few, or only very poor quality, RCTs which\nmeet the inclusion criteria will be found. In this case the best\nevidence available will be included (Petticrew 2006), firstly, con-\ntrolled before and after studies and secondly, if there are very few\nor only very poor quality controlled studies, interrupted time se-\nries designs (Jackson 2005).\nPublished and unpublished studies in any language will be con-\nsidered.\nTypes of participants\nStudies involving adolescents of secondary school age (aged 11-\n18 years, grades 7-12), or those teaching or treating them, will be\nincluded in the review.\nStudies conducted in school, community, health care or residential\ncare settings, or in young offenders\u2019 institutions will be included.\nTypes of interventions\nInterventions\nPrimary interventions (i.e. those aimed at preventing problems\nbefore they start) aimed at the prevention of suicide will be in-\ncluded. They include curriculum based suicide awareness pro-\ngrammes; skills-based programmes; screening with a view to fur-\nther intervention for those considered at risk; gatekeeper train-\ning; peer helper programmes; postvention\/crisis intervention; cri-\nsis centres and hotlines; restriction of the means of suicide; media\neducation; primary care health worker intervention.\nInterventions aimed specifically at youths who self-harm or have\nalready made a suicide attempt will be excluded. Pharmaceutical\ninterventions will be excluded. Interventions specifically aimed at\nyoung people with diagnoses of mental and behavioural disorders\nas defined by theWorld Health Organisation\u2019s International Clas-\nsification ofDiseases (ICD-10)will be excluded, except in the cases\nof conduct and emotional disorders (F90-F94) (WHO 1992).\nInterventions will be categorised according to the list in paragraph\none of this section.\nControl conditions\nControl conditions will include any other intervention, no inter-\nvention\/usual care and waiting list.\nMain comparisons\nPrevention of suicide intervention versus any other intervention\nPrevention of suicide intervention versus no intervention\/usual\ncare\/waiting list\nTypes of outcome measures\nThere are difficulties in operationalising the distinction between\nsuicide attempts, where there is an intention to die, and deliberate\nself-harm, where there is no intention to die. Terms are used in\ndifferent ways and there are systematic cultural variations in their\nuse. Therefore we will amalgamate suicide attempts and deliberate\nself-harm into a single category, \u201cnon-fatal suicidal behaviour\u201d,\n4Prevention of suicide and suicidal behaviour in adolescents (Protocol)\nCopyright \u00a9 2008 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Yes (low risk of bias)\nB. Unclear\nC. No (high risk of bias).\nIncluded studies will be critically appraised by two independent\nreviewers to assess the risk of bias. Any disagreementswhich cannot\nbe resolvedwill be referred to a third reviewer.Where necessary, the\nauthors of the studies will be contacted for further information.\nThe application of assessment criteria will be piloted to ensure\ncriteria can be applied consistently.\nIn addition to using the RoB tool, we are planning to use\nthe Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies devel-\noped by the Effective Public Health Practice Project (http:\/\/\nwww.city.hamilton.on.ca\/PHCS\/EPHPP\/). The tool can be used\nfor quantitative studies including randomised controlled trials,\ncontrolled before and after designs and interrupted time series de-\nsigns. The tool assesses studies on:\nA Selection bias\nB Study design\nC Confounders\nD Blinding\nE Data Collection\nF Withdrawals and Dropouts\nG Analysis\nH Intervention Integrity\nMeasures of treatment effect\nContinuous data will be analysed if means and standard deviations\nare available. For binary outcomes, a standard estimation of the\nodds ratio (OR) with the 95% confidence interval will be calcu-\nlated. Post-intervention means and, where baseline data are avail-\nable, pre-intervention means will be reported.Where possible, rel-\native change from baseline in the intervention group will be calcu-\nlated (intervention group change - control group change), along\nwith standard deviations and 95% confidence intervals. Contin-\nuous variables that are measured on different scales in different\nstudies will be analysed as standardised mean differences (SMD),\nand confidence intervals (95%) will be reported.\nUnit of analysis issues\nAny cluster randomised trials will be identified in the review. The\nmethods used to analyse these, and whether the risk of unit of\nanalysis error was dealt with appropriately, will be reported.Where\nthe analysis was carried out appropriately, studies will be consid-\nered for meta-analysis. Where the analysis was inappropriate, ap-\nproximately correct analyses may be performed if the necessary\ninformation can be extracted (Higgins 2005).\nDealing with missing data\nStudy authors will be contacted to request data missing from in-\nformation onmethods or results. Information onmissing data and\ndropouts will be assessed for each study. The review will report the\nnumber of participants included in each study\u2019s final analysis as a\nproportion of all participants in the study. The possible effects of\nthe missing data will be discussed.\nData will be included only for those participants whose results are\nknown. The possible impact of missing data will be discussed.\nAssessment of reporting biases\nFunnel plots will be drawn to investigate the relationship between\nstudy power and effect size. An asymmetric plot may indicate bi-\nases such as publication bias or location biases, poorer method-\nological quality of smaller studies, or a true difference related to\nsmaller studies due, for instance, to differences in the delivery of\nthe intervention to smaller samples. Possible reasons for any asym-\nmetry will be explored (Egger 1997a).\nData synthesis and assessment of heterogeneity\nIn the first instance a common sense approach will be adopted\nto assessing whether meta-analyses combining data from different\nstudies are appropriate in terms of whether participants, interven-\ntions and outcomes are sufficiently similar (Krisjansson 2003). If\nmeta-analyses appear a possibility, statistical tests of heterogeneity\n(chi-square and I-square) will be carried out (Higgins 2003). A\nrandom-effects model will be used to allow for expected hetero-\ngeneity. Effect estimates will be weighted by the inverse of their\nvariance, giving greater weight to larger trials. It is possible that\neven if the types of intervention are diverse, a meta-analysis could\nusefully be carried out on studies of similar interventions, with\nsimilar research questions and similar outcomes, to provide an in-\ndication of the direction, but not the size, of any effect.\nMeta-analyses will only be carried out on any RCTs or quasi-\nRCTs included. Other studies, if included, will be summarised in\ntables additional to the meta-analyses, summarised in a narrative\nsynthesis and included in the discussion.\nSubgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\nSeparate analyses will be carried out for subgroups of studies with\nsimilar research questions based on:\n1. Type of intervention: curriculum based suicide awareness pro-\ngrammes; skills-based programmes; screening with a view to fur-\nther intervention for those considered at risk; gatekeeper train-\ning; peer helper programmes; postvention\/crisis intervention; cri-\nsis centres and hotlines; restriction of the means of suicide; media\neducation; primary care health worker intervention.\n2. Type of outcomes measured:\n\u2022 Rates of suicide\n6Prevention of suicide and suicidal behaviour in adolescents (Protocol)\nCopyright \u00a9 2008 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\n\u2022 Non-fatal suicidal behaviour\n\u2022 Suicidal ideation\n\u2022 Changes in protective behaviours including help-seeking\nbehaviour\n\u2022 Rates of identification of at-risk individuals and false-\npositives\n\u2022 Changes in knowledge, attitudes and intentions towards\nsuicide, suicidal peers and help-seeking\n\u2022 Changes in adults\u2019 knowledge, attitudes and intentions\ntowards young people and suicide\n\u2022 Measures of suicide risk factors, e.g. depression, anxiety\n\u2022 Measures of other outcomes related to mental health\n3. Type of setting of the intervention (school-based, community-\nbased, health-care based or those based in other institutions).\nAn attempt will be made to determine where interventions share\nsimilar features that are found to be successful or unsuccessful.\nSensitivity analysis\nA sensitivity analysis will be carried out to explore the effects of\nthe addition or removal of lower quality studies from the results.\nA C K N OW L E D G E M E N T S\nWewould like to thankMark Petticrew, Amanda Perry and Esther\nCoren for advising on the protocol.\nR E F E R E N C E S\nAdditional references\nCDC 1994\nCenter for Disease Control and Prevention.
