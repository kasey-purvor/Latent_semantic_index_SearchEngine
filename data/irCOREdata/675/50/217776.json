Critics of these reforms have argued that they\ncould adversely affect the motivational structure of the principal agents\ninvolved. More specifically, the previously prevalent altruistic or public-\nservice motivations might turn into more self-interested concerns, or in\nshort, \u2018knights \u2019 might become \u2018knaves \u2019 (Le Grand 2006; Titmuss 1970).\nThe aims of this paper are to explore whether, as a consequence of social-\ncare marketisation, increased competition and increased regulation, the\nmotivations of independent-sector residential-care providers have indeed\nchanged over time, and if so, to identify the factors associated with the\nchanges.\nThe focus is on the independent-sector care-home managers and own-\ners between 1994 and 2003. It has long been recognised that the motiva-\ntions of social-care actors need to be understood and taken into account in\nthe process of policy design (Le Grand 1997, 2006; Le Grand and Bartlett\n1993). With care market structures and service commissioning becoming\nmore sophisticated in their own right, the providers\u2019 motivations have\nbecome even more important in understanding the nature of care-home\nmarkets. From the strategic perspective, a better understanding of provi-\nders\u2019 motivations is important for developing services capable of re-\nsponding adequately to demographic changes. In England, the proportion\nof people aged 85 and over is projected to increase by two-thirds over the\nnext 20 years (Wanless et al. 2006: 31). It is uncertain, however, what\nproportion of the older population will become dependent and in need of\ncare services and support. With the marked emphasis on personalised care\nservices, choice, prevention and rehabilitation, and on improving the\ninterface between health and social care, it is difficult to predict what the\nsocial-care system will look like over the coming decades.\nThe conceptual framework proposed here is relatively inclusive in that\nindividuals\u2019 motivations and actions are considered to be essentially the\noutcomes of the interactions between individual aspirations and external\ninfluences, with the nature of the interactions mediated by a specifically\ndesigned incentive structure. This paper builds on our earlier work on the\nmotivations of independent-sector care-providers (Kendall et al. 2003;\nMatosevic et al. 2007). While the focus of these previous studies was\nprimarily on developing providers\u2019 motivational typologies principally\nusing cross-sectional data, the present paper is concerned with whether\nand how providers\u2019 motivations changed over time. We look at changes\n1390 Tihana Matosevic et al.\nfrom 1994 to 2003, a period of not only the noted major changes in policy\nand state funding, but also in the population\u2019s attitudes towards purchas-\ning care.\nThe paper is structured as follows. The next section briefly outlines the\nsector balance and expenditure activity of the care-home market for older\npeople together with a short overview of the introduction of markets in\nsocial care. This is followed by a brief description of the key regulatory\ndevelopments associated with changes in care-home markets since the\nearly 1990s. The sampling methodology and methods for data analysis are\nthen described followed by the presentation of the results. The last section\ndraws some conclusions and discusses policy implications.\nSector balance\nDuring the 1980s \u2018privatisation\u2019 came to the forefront of British public\npolicy. There was a major change in the provision of state services from\nthe public to the independent sector (i.e. to both for-profit and voluntary or\nthird-sector non-profit care providers). Largely as a result of opening up\nthe supply side, the independent sector became the dominant provider of\ncare services for older people in England. In outline, the care reforms of the\nearly 1990s resulted in a major shift that ended the dominance of local\nauthority providers and created a more mixed economy of supply, with\ngreater market shares for the independent sectors (Hardy, Young and\nWistow 1999). In 1994, privately-owned and voluntary-sector care homes\nprovided care for 75 per cent of all people accommodated in care homes\n(Department of Health 1994). Since then, the market share of the inde-\npendent sector has steadily grown, and by 2003, it accounted for 87 per\ncent of all residents (Department of Health 2003a). Recent figures indicate\nthat the trend has continued, with 89 per cent of all residents accom-\nmodated in this sector in 2007 (Laing and Buisson 2007). It is also the case\nthat care homes for older people are becoming larger but without apparent\ndomination by corporate providers (Wanless et al. 2006: 22).\nMarkets in social care\nThe encouragement of social-care markets was at the heart of the com-\nmunity-care changes set out in the 1990 National Health Service and Community\nCare Act. The hope for markets was that they would provide more effective\nmeans for securing the social policy goals that drove the community-care\nreforms. They were supposed to rectify the failure of the prevailing ad-\nministrative hierarchies to deliver services tailored to individual needs and\npreferences. With the social-care market model came new organisational\nand funding arrangements that were designed to provide more effective\nMotivations of independent care-home managers 1391\ninstruments for the promotion of choice and independence. Under these\nchanges, local authority social services departments were required to as-\nsume new roles and responsibilities for market management and devel-\nopment, which required a revolution in systems, attitudes and behaviours\nat all levels (Wistow et al. 1996). The opening up of public services to\nexternal and internal competition was expected to stimulate a wider range\nof better-quality services.\nAn earlier study of residential care providers concluded that\nneither pure market nor pure hierarchy is an appropriate governance structure\nfor the successful operation of the mixed economy of social care. Instead, some\nintermediate form of quasi-market (embedded in a social network) where re-\nlationships are more integrated and collaborative appears more desirable.\n(Wistow et al. 1996: 171)\nQuasi-markets emerged as an alternative to the established welfare state\nwith its limited provision of choice and inefficient structures. According to\nLe Grand:\nthey are markets because they replace the monopolistic state providers with\ncompetitive independent ones. They are \u2018quasi \u2019 because they differ from con-\nventional markets in a number of key areas. The differences are on both the\nsupply and the demand sides. (1991 : 1259\u201360)\nSupply is not necessarily driven by the profit motive, and as for the de-\nmand, users do not make choices regarding purchasing of services but the\nservices are purchased by a third party on their behalf.\nIt was also assumed that the market mechanism would formalise com-\nmissioner\u2013provider relationships through contracts, and that they would\nensure better regulation and monitoring of services (Forder, Knapp and\nWistow 1996). Le Grand and Bartlett pointed out that\nthe whole movement of bringing market structures into the area of social care in\nthe early 1990s was part of a wider, worldwide disenchantment with the perceived\ninefficiencies and unresponsiveness of large-scale, centrally planned organisations\nand a greater reliance on decentralisation and markets ; quasi or otherwise.\n(1993: 9)\nFollowing the pioneering work of Titmuss (1970), many critics have drawn\nattention to what they perceive to be the dangers of such market-oriented\nreform (see Le Grand 2006: 40\u20131 for a summary). Specifically, it was argued\nthat the spread of market incentives will damage altruistic or other pro-\nfessional motivations, replacing them by more self-interested (usually\nfinancial) aspirations. Intrinsic motivation (the drive to do things for their\nown sake) will be driven out by extrinsic motivation (doing things only\nbecause of the receipt external reward). Other-directed knights will\n1392 Tihana Matosevic et al.\nbecome egoistic knaves. Part of the aim of this paper is to test these pro-\npositions.\nThe policy context and care-homemanagers\u2019 and owners\u2019 motivations\nIncreased marketisation has not been the only significant change over\nthe period. There have been related policy changes, mostly involving\nincreased central regulation of various kinds. These, too, might be expected\nto have an effect on provider motivations, as we shall now see. In the period\nfrom the early 1990s up to 2003, independent-sector care-home managers\nand owners were faced with a number of organisational and financial\nchallenges, including changes in care-home regulations, staff shortages\n(particularly of care staff), and the bureaucratisation of care services. Each\nof these might have influenced providers\u2019 motivations.\nThe regulation of care homes for older people\nThe Social Services Inspectorate was established in 1985 as the first\nnational inspectorate for the personal social services in England, and it held\nthe responsibility until 2004. It was responsible for carrying out inspections,\nbringing professional experience to bear on policy and supporting its im-\nplementation, and securing the effective management of government\nbusiness on social-care matters (Department of Health 2004). The inspec-\ntorate had a significant influence on policy across children\u2019s and adults\u2019\nservices. The period between 1995 and 1998 saw a drive towards a more\nsystematic approach to standards. In 1997, the Social Services Inspectorate\npublished five volumes of standards that had been developed and used\nbetween 1993 and 1996. This was followed in 2001 by the introduction of\n\u2018 star ratings \u2019 and the first star ratings published tables in May 2002. By\n2003\u201304, performance assessment had become a regular practice.\nWith regards to regulations, there has been increased pressure for in-\ndependent-sector care homes to meet the National Minimum Standards for\nCare Homes for Older People published in March 2001 with effect from April\n2002 (Department of Health 2001). The standards were designed to pro-\ntect older people in care homes and to promote their health and quality of\nlife. Because many care homes, particularly the smaller establishments,\nwere unable to comply with some of the new standards (particularly the\nspace requirements), the 2002 standards were amended in March 2003\n(Department of Health 2003b). Evidence showed that care homes for older\npeople were compliant on average with 72 per cent of the standards\n(Wanless et al. 2006).\nMotivations of independent care-home managers 1393\nAs a result of the new regulations, many small care home organisations\nfound themselves under great financial pressures to meet the standards,\nagain particularly the space and environmental requirements. Evidence\nfrom a study of home closures found that meeting the costs of the National\nMinimum Standards was one of the main reasons for closure (Williams et al.\n2002). Particularly onerous was the investment required to upgrade build-\nings, the revenue implications of need to reduce the number of rooms or\nresidents, and anticipated increases in running costs associated with the\nraised staff ratios and qualifications. Under these circumstances, it was\nassumed that the higher costs would change providers\u2019 motivations; for\ninstance, providers that previously were not greatly concerned with their\npersonal income and profit maximising were likely to become more fi-\nnancially orientated.\nCare staff recruitment and retention\nA number of regulatory issues relating to the social care workforce could,\neither directly of indirectly, have had an effect on the delivery and quality\nof services (Wanless et al. 2006). For a long time, staff recruitment and\nretention had been a key challenge for the social-care sector (Henwood\n2001). Problems with recruiting and retaining care staff are generally as-\nsociated with low wages, poor working conditions and keen competition\nfor staff in local labour markets. The rate of job vacancies in the social-\ncare sector has until recently been high: there were 53,000 in England in\n2004. The National Employers Skills Survey found that in 2003, vacancy\nrates in social care were about twice as high as those for the whole of all\nprivate-sector and public-sector jobs in England (Eborall 2005; Wanless\net al. 2006). Turnover rates in public-sector homes have also been high, at\nbetween 8.7 and 17.1 per cent in England in 2003 (Wanless et al. 2006).\nHome providers have faced severe financial pressures associated with\nstaffing costs. According to those that participated in a Personal Social\nService Research Unit (PSSRU) study of home closures, the introduction\nof the National Minimum Wage meant that the fees they could charge\nwere insufficient to cover their costs (Williams et al. 2002). There were\nalso additional costs from a Working Time Directive that entitled staff\nto four weeks of paid leave. Those financial pressures may have forced\nproviders to change their priorities and compromised their caring moti-\nvations.\nBureaucratisation of care-home services for older people\nThe high level of bureaucracy imposed on providers by sector regulation\nand contracts with local authority funders has been generally recognised\n1394 Tihana Matosevic et al.\nas a disincentive or barrier to running care-home services. Many\nmanagers and owners complain about the huge increase in paperwork and\nadministrative tasks involved in running a care home and how it reduced\nthe time available to look after their clients, and many that participated in\nour surveys emphasised the changing nature of their role as care providers.\nThe increased administrative load has left many feeling professionally\nfrustrated and unable to realise their full potential.\nStudy design, sampling and data collection\nInformation was collected about care-home managers and owners be-\ntween 1994 and 2003 as part of the Department of Health-funded pro-\ngramme of research in PSSRU. There were three care-home provider\nstudies. The first in 1994 used a sample of 62 homes selected from eight\nEnglish local authorities : two London boroughs, three administrative\ncounties and three Metropolitan districts. These eight authorities were\nbroadly representative of the national picture with regard to total expen-\nditure on personal social services (PSS) per head of population, political\ncontrol, and the percentages of places in residential care homes for\nolder people in the private and voluntary sectors. The second study\nin 1997 collected information from 53 homes, including 40 that had\nbeen in the earlier sample. Again, home managers and owners were\ninterviewed. Finally, in 2003 information was gathered from 58 homes,\n26 of which had been included in the previous two studies. Non-\nresponse reduced the number of local authority areas included in this\nfinal round of data collection to seven (in one local authority, one of\nthe two homes from the original sample in 1994 had closed for business,\nand the manager\/owner of the other home was unavailable for an inter-\nview).\nThe information about care-home managers\u2019 and owners\u2019 motivations\nwas collected through face-to-face semi-structured interviews and postal\nquestionnaires. These research instruments included questions about\nhome characteristics and market experiences, prices and contracts, pro-\nviders\u2019 motivations and their relationship with the local authority. To\ncompare information regarding motivations, the questions about pro-\nvider motivations were the same in all three studies. All the inter-\nviews were recorded and transcribed. The first part of the analysis\nis based on the follow-up information collected from this original\nsample of 26 homes in seven English local authorities. The second set\nof findings is based on the analysis of the combined samples from all three\nstudies.\nMotivations of independent care-home managers 1395\nResults\nSample characteristics\nOut of 26 homes, 15 were owned by private-for-profit organisations,\nand 11 homes were in the voluntary sector. From the original sample of\n62 homes selected in 1994, 42 per cent were subsequently interviewed\nin both 1997 and 2004. Fourteen of the 26 homes were part of a larger\norganisation, six being private or for-profit sector, eight homes being in\nthe voluntary non-profit sector. The remaining 12 were single home or-\nganisations, of which nine were privately owned. As for the geographical\nspread of the 26 homes, the numbers varied from only one home in one\nlocal authority to six in another. In terms of the status of the interviewee,\nthe sample consisted of 18 care-home managers and eight care-home\nproprietors.\nComparisons over time : expressed motivations\nMeeting the needs of older people was cited as one of the important mo-\ntivations in all three years (89% in 1994 and 1997, and 92% in 2003)\n(Table 1). A large proportion of the respondents identified professional\naccomplishment as one of their main motives (73% in 1994 and 2003,\nand 89% in 1997), and the number citing the development of skills and\nexpertise grew over time (54% in 1994, 65% in 1997, and 77% in 2003). A\nsatisfactory level of personal income was equally important in 1994 and\n1997, but had higher prevalence in 2003 (73%). Achieving \u2018 independence\nand autonomy\u2019 also became more prevalent, from 42 per cent in 1997\nto 62 per cent in 1994 and 2003, as did fulfilling a \u2018duty to society \u2019, from\n23 per cent in 1994 to 46 per cent in 1997 and 2003.

In both\n1994 and 2003, only 12 per cent of interviewees selected this as a main\nmotive, and in 1997 it was only 8 per cent.\nPaired-samples tests were used to identify significant differences be-\ntween years in the prevalence of the expressed motivations. Although none\nwere found for the overall samples or by sector, there were clear numerical\ntrends (Table 2). Over time, voluntary-sector care-home mangers attached\ngreater weight to developing skills and to a satisfactory level of personal\nincome. For private-sector care-home managers and owners, developing\nskills became more prevalent over the study period, while the weight at-\ntached to achievement of a level of personal income was stable.\nComparisons over time : ranked motivations\nThe 26 respondents\u2019 three most important motivations were collected.\nLooking at the first-ranked motives in 1994 (Table 3), meeting the needs of\nolder people was the most prevalent motivation (eight), followed by pro-\nfessional accomplishment (five), and duty to a particular section of society\n(four). \u2018 Income and profit maximising\u2019 and \u2018duty to society \u2019 were each\nnominated by only one respondent as their most important motivation. In\n1997, again the most prevalent first motivation was meeting the needs of\nolder people (seven), followed by the five who nominated a satisfactory\nlevel of personal income, and then three nominations for each of pro-\nfessional accomplishment, development of skills and duty to a particular\nsection of society. The rankings in 2003 were quite different, however,\nwith personal income as the most prevalent motivation (seven) closely\nfollowed by the six that nominated meeting the needs of older people, and\nsix nominations for development of skills.\nT A B L E 2.Motivations of care-home managers and owners by sector, England, 1994,\n1997 and 2003\nMotivation and sector 1994 1997 2003 Sample size\nFrequencies (%)\nMeeting the needs of older people :\nPrivate 12 (80) 12 (80) 13 (87) 15\nVoluntary 11 (100) 11 (100) 11 (100) 11\nDeveloping skills and expertise :\nPrivate 7 (47) 9 (60) 11 (73) 15\nVoluntary 7 (63) 8 (73) 9 (82) 11\nSatisfactory level of personal income:\nPrivate 11 (73) 11 (73) 11 (73) 15\nVoluntary 5 (46) 5 (46) 8 (73) 11\nMotivations of independent care-home managers 1397\nThe findings therefore indicate a slight change in the most prevalent\nmotivations across the three points in time. Whereas meeting the needs of\nolder people was clearly the most important motive in 1994 and 1997, it\nwas supplanted by achieving a satisfactory level of personal income in\n2003, although meeting the needs of older people was close behind.\nPersonal income and development of skills have become more important\nover the years, but on the other hand, independence and autonomy, and\nduty to a particular section of society became less important. None of the\nchanges were statistically significant. Overall, an \u2018average\u2019 care-home\nprovider in 2003 was highly motivated by gaining satisfactory personal\nincome and meeting the needs of older people, and secondarily by using\nand developing professional skills and achieving a sense of accomplishment.\nMeeting the needs of older people was the most prevalent second moti-\nvation in all three years (seven in 1994 and 2003, and ten in 1997).\nProfessional accomplishment was also relatively prevalent in 1997 (eight),\nbut less frequently selected in 2003 (five). Meeting older peoples\u2019 needs\nwas also the most frequently nominated third motivation in all three years,\nand other relatively prevalent motivations were professional accomplish-\nment, satisfactory personal income, and achieving independence and\nautonomy.\nThe expressed motivations were also ranked by the sector of provision\nin which the managers and owners worked (Table 4). For voluntary-sector\nproviders, caring motivations, developing skills and achieving a satisfactory\nlevel of personal income became more prevalent over time. For private-\nsector providers, the prevalence of meeting the needs of older people as\nthe first-ranked motivation decreased over time, a marginally significant\nresult (five in 1994, one in 2003). The only significant difference was in the\nprevalence of meeting the needs of older people (Table 4). In 2003, caring\nT A B L E 3.

A second panel\ndataset was compiled that pooled the information from all the 173 homes\nthat were sampled in 1994, 1997 and 2003, and added a number of market\nindicators that might have shaped the providers\u2019 motivations. Provider\ncharacteristics such as expressed motivations, sector, the size of the homes,\nand geographical locations were all included as indicators in the analysis.\nData were not available for all providers in the sample at all three time-\npoints. The analysis applied a panel probit model using the command\nXTPROBIT from Stata 9, which accommodates the unbalanced nature\nof the panel dataset (Baltagi and Song 2006). The indicators of market\ncharacteristics (broadly defined) were identified from standard data sour-\nces, and pertaining demand, local authority funding of residents, costs and\nhome attributes (Table 6).

The dependent variable is provider motivation, defined as\nthe presence or absence of each of the nominated motivations among\nthe care-home providers. The analysis focuses on three key motives : pro-\nfessional development, meeting the needs of older people, and achieving\na satisfactory personal income.\nMotivation models\nTable 7 shows the model statistics for the three motivations.

These results\nimply that, under conditions of high demand for care-home services,\nsuch a market environment is more likely to attract primarily income-\norientated providers.\nThe results for the professional motivations model show significant positive\nrelationships between professional aspirations and local property prices,\nthe proportion of the population aged 65 or more years and whether the\nhome remained open in 2003. These results imply that, over the study\nperiod, professionally-motivated respondents were more likely to stay in\nbusiness for longer periods. A significant relationship between property\nprices and professional drives could be partly attributed to their residents\u2019\nexpectations with regards to the standards and quality of care-home ser-\nvices. For instance, it is possible that in wealthier local authorities, service\nusers (and their families) have relatively high expectations of care homes,\nand meeting their demands requires strong professional motivation and\nskills, and therefore a higher concentration of professionally-orientated\nmanagers and owners. Similar to the income model, a strong negative\nrelationship was found between professional motivations and the sector of\nownership: between 1994 and 2003, voluntary-sector managers tended\nto be less driven (compared to private-sector managers\/owners) by pro-\nfessional aspirations. The model for the third motivation, to meet the needs of\nolder people, indicates a strong negative relationship with private-sector own-\nership but no other significant effects (Table 7). These results broadly\ncorrespond to the findings from the earlier analyses for the sub-sample of\n26 homes for which we had data at all three time-points : caring for older\npeople was the only significant difference between private- and voluntary-\nsector providers. Although these results are far from conclusive, they\nnevertheless demonstrate that there has been some change in the priorities\ngiven by private-sector respondents in terms of their caring motivations.\nConclusions and policy implications\nThe analysis of care-home managers\u2019 and owners\u2019 expressed motivations\nin England between 1994 and 2003 indicates a broadly stable pattern. For\nboth private-sector and voluntary-sector providers, caring for older people\nwas the most important expressed motivation. Other prominent motives\nwere developing skills, professional development, and personal income.\nThe analysis of the ranked data revealed no significant difference except\nwhen disaggregated by sector of ownership. The evidence suggested that\n1402 Tihana Matosevic et al.\nby 2003 the most prevalent motivations had changed slightly for private-\nsector providers since 1994. \u2018Caring for older people \u2019 was the only\nmotivation on which the two independent sectors differed, with relatively\nfewer private-sector care-home managers and owners selecting this drive.\nThe findings suggest private-sector providers had to an extent responded\nto changing market conditions in the care-home sector. According to\nBartlett and Le Grand (1993), a number of specific conditions need to\nbe met if markets are to be successful in becoming more efficient and\nresponsive and in creating more choice. They argued that\nproviders ought to be motivated at least in part by financial considerations. If they\nare not, they will not respond appropriately to market signals. It makes little sense\nintroducing a market to create profitable opportunities, if the participants in the\nmarket are not interested in making profits. (1993 : 30)\nThe motivational models largely confirmed some of the views that are\nwidely shared among policy makers, local authority commissioners and\npurchasers. For instance, the voluntary sector is perceived to be less in-\nterested in income and professional development, and mainly driven by\ncaring motivations, while private-sector homes seemed to be more con-\ncerned with financial aspects of care provision, as well as autonomy and\nindependence. The findings of this study suggest, however, that market\ndevelopments between 1994 and 2003 had relatively little effect on the\nnature of care-home providers\u2019 motivations. Despite extremely challeng-\ning market pressures, care-home managers and owners had by and large\npreserved their initial motivations. In the context of social-care provision,\nthese results could be interpreted as both encouraging and quite damaging.\nThe positive aspect is that, broadly speaking, motivations are quite resist-\nant to market pressures. On the negative side, the relatively stable nature\nof providers\u2019 motives could create opportunities for moving toward poli-\ncies and reforms that could potentially take their motivations for granted.\nAs for the policy implications, the evidence that provider motivations\nare likely to stay relatively unchanged over longer periods of time provides\na valuable insight into the dynamic of motivational structures and market\nmechanisms. Of particular relevance for the policy is the finding that\nprofessional motivations are a prominent feature of the providers\u2019 moti-\nvational profile. Essentially, the results demonstrated that the individuals\nwith a more distinct professional drive tended to remain in the care-home\nbusiness for longer. This is undoubtedly important for the quality of care\nensuring that services are delivered by professionally motivated individuals\nand with a certain degree of continuity.\nAlthough the motivations were found to be relatively stable, the study\ndid not examine changes in motivations under more extreme conditions\nMotivations of independent care-home managers 1403\nsuch as experiences of home closures. The sample only included homes\nwhich managed to survive in the market for a certain period of time by\nadapting to often difficult market conditions. Furthermore, the analysis\nwas based on the assumption that the sample was relatively homogeneous\nwhich could potentially create a slightly distorted view that, over time, no\nchanges had been found in providers\u2019 motivations. It is possible that the\nanalytical framework used was relatively robust in order to detect local\nvariations within the sample local authorities.\nIt would have been interesting to examine the motives of care-home\nmanagers and owners who declined to take part in the study. However,\nconsidering the reasons for not taking part (e.g. four homes had closed\nbetween the first and second surveys, several managers had moved on to\nother jobs), it was concluded that those observations were unlikely signifi-\ncantly to influence the main findings. Moreover, the practical challenges\nof gathering data from or about people who were no longer working in the\nsector would have been considerable. The growth of marketisation has\nhad a long-lasting effect on the nature of the social-care system for older\npeople (Knapp, Hardy and Forder 2001), but the concern that a conse-\nquence is that knights will have turned into knaves is largely unfounded.\nNOTE\n1 See http:\/\/www.opsi.gov.uk\/acts\/acts1990\/ukpga_19900019_en_1.htm.\nReferences\nBaltagi, H.
