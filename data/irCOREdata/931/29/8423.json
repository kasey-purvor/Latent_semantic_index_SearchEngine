INTRODUCTION\nIsomeric J\u03c0 = 232\n+\n, 192\n\u2212\n, and 152\n\u2212\nstates have previously\nbeen observed in odd-mass antimony nuclei and have been\ninterpreted [1] as the odd g 7\n2\nproton coupled to known isomeric\n10+, 7\u2212, and 5\u2212 states in the (A\u22121)Sn core, respectively,\nbased on the energy systematics. Figure 1 shows the energy\nsystematics of these states in 121\u2212131Sb in comparison with\nthe even-A tin isotopes and indeed a clear correlation is\nobserved. A more stringent test of any comparison requires\nanalysis of transition probabilities. The half-lives of isomeric\nstates in 127\u2212131Sb are known from measurements of the \u03b2\ndecay of 127\u2212131Sn [1\u20133] and, for 121,123Sb, from the results of\nfission fragment experiments [4,5]. The values for 125Sb were\nmeasured by [4,6\u20138] but have large error bars associated with\nthem. In addition, the J\u03c0 values were uncertain.\nPrevious work on 125Sb by Liu et al. [7,8] reported on the\n124Sn(7Li,\u03b12n)125Sb reaction and proposed the existence of\nthree isomeric states: (i) a ( 152\n\u2212) state at 1970 keV with a\nhalf-life between 70 and 600 ns, (ii) a ( 192\n\u2212) state at 2110 keV\nwith a lower limit on the half-life given as 2 ms in Ref. [7]\nand 2 \u00b5s in Ref. [8], and (iii) a ( 232\n+) state at 2471 keV with\na half-life between 40 and 200 ns. A subsequent study by\nPorquet et al. [4] used the EUROBALL III and IV detectors\nto study fission fragments induced by heavy-ion reactions but\nonly observed one isomeric state, at 2470 keV, for which they\nmeasured a half-life of 155(20) ns and assigned a J\u03c0 value\nof 192\n\u2212\n. This is not consistent with the J\u03c0 = 232\n+\nassignment\n*Alison.Bruce@brighton.ac.uk\n\u2020Current address: Department of Physics & Astronomy, University\nof Kentucky, Lexington KY 40506, USA.\n\u2021Current address: Department of Physics, University of York,\nHeslington, York YO10 5DD, UK.\nmade by Liu et al. [7,8]. Porquet et al. [4] also identified a\nJ\u03c0 = ( 192\n\u2212) isomeric state in 123Sb at an excitation energy of\n2237 keV for which a half-life of 110(10) ns was measured.\nThe current article reports the results of experiments aimed at\npinning down the J\u03c0 values of states in 125Sb and measuring\nthe half-lives of isomeric states in 123,125Sb.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE\nExcited states in 125Sb were populated using the\n124Sn(7Li,\u03b12n)125Sb incomplete fusion reaction. The beam\nwas provided by the 14UD Pelletron Tandem accelerator at\nthe Australian National University (ANU) and the Super-E\nelectron spectrometer [10,11] was used in conjunction with\na single germanium detector to measure electron-conversion\ncoefficients and half-lives. In this case a beam energy of\n37 MeV was used and the 124Sn target was 1.5 mg\/cm2 thick.\nTwo different beam profiles were used: (i) 2 ns pulses separated\nby 1.7 \u00b5s and (ii) 2.7 \u00b5s pulses separated by 85.6 \u00b5s. A prompt\nveto of 2.8 \u00b5s was applied in the latter case so that only delayed\ntransitions were recorded. \u03b3 -ray and electron energies were\nrecorded along with their time measured with respect to the rf\npulse train. These data were used to construct two sets (one for\neach beam profile) of time-electron and time-\u03b3 matrices that\ncontained the energy on one axis and the time on the other.\nAn experiment to measure the half-lives of long lived\n(T1\/2 > 2 \u00b5s) states in 123Sb was performed using the\n122Sn(7Li,\u03b12n)123Sb reaction at a beam energy of 35 MeV.\nThe target was 3.5 mg\/cm2 thick and a beam pulsing profile\nof 21.4 \u00b5s on\/428 \u00b5s off was used with a prompt veto of\n21.7 \u00b5s. \u03b3 rays were detected in the CAESAR germanium\ndetector array [12], augmented by three Compton suppressed\ngermanium detectors. \u03b3 -ray energies and their time measured\nwith respect to the rf pulse train were collected and a time-\u03b3\nmatrix was constructed and analyzed.\n0556-2813\/2007\/76(5)\/054306(7) 054306-1 \u00a92007 The American Physical Society\nD.

Comparison of the J \u03c0 = 232\n+\n, 192\n\u2212\n,\nand 152\n\u2212\nstates in the odd-A antimony isotopes\n[1\u20135,7,8] with the energies of the J \u03c0 = 10+, 7\u2212,\nand 5\u2212 states in the even-A tin isotopes [9]. The\nJ \u03c0 values for the levels in 125Sb are uncertain\nand therefore are shown as open symbols.\nIII. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nA. 125Sb\nThe level scheme for 125Sb is shown in Fig. 2 and Table I\nlists the relative intensities of transitions below the isomeric\nstates in 125Sb, measured using the beam pulsing profile of\n2 ns on\/1.7 \u00b5s off with a condition requiring that the events\nwere detected at least 100 ns after the beam pulse. Intensities\nare normalized to the 1090.0 keV transition. The half-lives of\nstates at 1972, 2113, 2326, and 2472 keV were also obtained.\nFigure 3(a) shows the decay profile of the 2472 keV state,\nobtained by gating on the 146.3 keV transition. The straight\nline shows the fit to the decay curve, which gives the half-life\nof this state as 272(16) ns. Figure 3(b) shows the time spectrum\nobtained by gating on the 1067.8 keV transition. As the\n1972 keV level is fed strongly by the 2113 keV state, which is\nitself isomeric, the spectrum shows a two-component decay\nand has been fitted using the value of 28.0(7) \u00b5s for the\nhalf-life of the 2113 keV state obtained from an analysis of the\ntime profile of the 140.9 keV transition. This yields a half-life\nof 4.1(2) \u00b5s for the 1972 keV state which supersedes that\nquoted in Ref. [15] [5.7(3) \u00b5s]. This difference is due to a\ntypographical error in the previous analysis.\nThe fifth column of Table I lists the conversion coeffi-\ncients measured in this experiment. Preliminary results from\nthis analysis have been published in Ref. [15]. Conversion\ncoefficients could not be measured for the 105.1, 107.9, or\n131.8 keV transitions because of the high level of background\nin the low-energy region of the electron spectrum. However,\na value of \u03b1tot has been deduced for the 131.8 keV transition\nfrom a balance of intensities across the 2194 keV state. The\nmultipolarity of the 1104.2 keV transition that depopulates the\n2194 keV level is not known but the energy of this transition is\nso high that the difference between the conversion coefficient\nfor an E1 transition and an E2 transition is insignificant. The\ninternal conversion coefficient of the 131.8 keV transition\nis consistent with it having a multipolarity of E2. The\n140.9 keV transition is observed in the \u03b3 -ray spectrum as a\ndoublet with a 139.7 keV contaminant transition and therefore\nthese peaks had to be unfolded.

Level scheme for 125Sb from the\npresent work. The \u03b3 -ray energies are given in\nkeV and the thickness of the arrows represents\nthe relative \u03b3 -ray intensity. The prompt 1419.9,\n1087.7, 469.7, and 332.1 keV transitions are\nknown from \u03b2-decay studies [13]; however, the\nintensities of these states were too weak to be\nmeasured in the current work.\nrays, energy spectra were produced from the beam-\u03b3 matrix\nwith gates 10\u201343 \u00b5s and 43\u201376 \u00b5s after the prompt peak. The\nnumber of counts making up the 139.7 and 140.9 keV peaks\nwas determined for each time gate and put into a 2 \u00d7 2 matrix\nas a percentage of the total number of counts. This matrix was\nthen transposed to give the coefficients needed to resolve the\n139.7 and 140.9 keV \u03b3 -ray peaks from the time gated spectra.\nFigure 4 illustrates the results of this process and shows that the\n139.7 keV contaminant was not seen in the electron spectrum,\nindicating that it was not from the target. The electron spectrum\ndoes not show any evidence for a peak corresponding to the\n1104.2 keV transition and this nonobservation implies that the\n1104.2 keV transition is of either E1 or E2 multipolarity.\nThe level scheme shown in Fig. 2 is based on that published\nby Liu et al. [7,8], discussed in Sec. I, but shows the half-lives\nmeasured in the current work. The J\u03c0 values assigned to the\nisomeric states in the current work are consistent with those\nassigned in Refs. [7,8] and, specifically, the spin and parity of\nthe 2472 keV state is confirmed as 232\n+\n. This is not consistent\nwith the value of ( 192\n\u2212) assigned in the work of Porquet et al. [4]\nbut the previous interpretation was based only on systematic\narguments and so the assignment made in the current work is\npreferred. The 2326 keV state has been observed as isomeric\nin the current work and may not have been identified as such\npreviously [4,7,8] because of the short half-life [31(2) ns],\nwhich may have been outside their experimental sensitivity.\nB. 123Sb\nThe experiment on 123Sb provided evidence for an isomeric\nstate with a half-life greater than 2 \u00b5s. The 2614 keV state was\nmeasured to have a half-life of 66(4) \u00b5s by fitting the summed\n\u03b3 -gated spectra shown in Fig. 5. In parallel with the current\nwork, Jones et al. [5] have obtained a half-life of 52(3) \u00b5s for\nthis state. The reason for the discrepancy between this value\nand that measured in the current work is unclear.\nIV. DISCUSSION\nIsotopes in the range 121Sb to 131Sb have 1 proton and\n20\u201330 neutrons in the Z\/N = 50\u201382 shell, which contains the\ng 7\n2\n, d 5\n2\n, d 3\n2\n, s 1\n2\n, and h 11\n2\norbitals. The shell-model calculations\npresented in the current work were performed using the\nOxbash code [16] and the SN100PN [17] interaction and model\nspace. The single-particle energies used were deduced from\nthe experimentally observed level schemes of 131Sn [18] and\n133Sb [19]. This interaction has been used with good success\nto describe the excitation energies and magnetic moments of\nthe even mass 124\u2212130Sn, 130\u2212134Te, and 134Xe isotopes [17].\nHowever, calculations in the full model space could only be\nachieved for odd-mass antimony nuclei heavier than 125Sb;\ntherefore, it was necessary to truncate the space.

To compensate for this, multiplicative fac-\ntors were derived by comparing the excitation energies of\nthe first J\u03c0 = 92\n+\n, 112\n+\n, 152\n+\n, 152\n\u2212\n, 192\n+\n, 192\n\u2212\n, and 232\n+\nstates\nin 127,129,131Sb calculated using the restricted model space\nwith those calculated using the full model space. This gave\ncompression factors of 1.19 for 131Sb, 1.26 for 129Sb, and\n1.32 for 127Sb. A linear extrapolation of these values gives a\ncompression factor of 1.44 for 125Sb. The calculated level\nscheme multiplied by this factor is shown in Fig. 6 with\nthe arrows representing experimentally observed transitions.\nThe overall level of agreement between the calculated levels\nshown in Fig. 6 and the experimental level scheme, shown\nin Fig. 2, is generally within \u223c200 keV but there are a few\nnotable exceptions. The first J\u03c0 = 52\n+\nstate is calculated to be\n\u223c800 keV too high and the second J\u03c0 = 92\n+\nstate is calculated\nto be \u223c700 keV above the first, while experimentally it is only\n\u223c350 keV above.\nFigure 7 shows the experimentally determined level ener-\ngies for the isomeric J\u03c0 = 232\n+\n, 192\n+\n, 192\n\u2212\n, and 152\n\u2212\nstates as\nwell as for the J\u03c0 = 52 , 92 , 112\n+\n, and 152\n+\nstates in 123Sb taken\nfrom Refs. [4,5], in comparison with those calculated using\nthe restricted model space and multiplied by the extrapolated\nfactor of 1.52. The figure shows that the agreement between\nexperiment and theory for these states is generally excellent,\nagreeing to within 100 keV. However, as in 125Sb, the\ncalculated energy of the J\u03c0 = 52\n+\nstate is several hundred keV\nhigher than is observed experimentally and the second J\u03c0 =\nFIG. 6.

A comparison of calculated and experimental level\nenergies for 123Sb showing selected levels below the 2614 keV isomer.\nCalculated level energies were multiplied by a factor of 1.52 to\naccount for the effect of the restricted model space.\n9\n2\n+\nstate is almost 1 MeV higher in the calculation than is seen\nexperimentally.\nThe J\u03c0 = 52\n+\nstate in 127Sb is observed experimentally at\n491 keV [1]. The results of calculations performed for 127Sb\nusing the full model space predict this state to be at 894 keV\nand so the poor agreement between experiment and theory in\nthe case of 125,123Sb is not due to the restricted model space\nbut possibly to the proton-neutron interaction used.\nThe first J\u03c0 = 92\n+\nstate in 121Sb has been identified from\n(t,\u03b1) reaction studies at 935 keV [20] and has been explained\nas being generated by the excitation of a g 9\n2\nproton across the\nZ = 50 shell gap. The corresponding states in 123,125Sb have\nbeen identified at 1324 and 1813 keV, respectively [20]. The\nsecond J\u03c0 = 92\n+\nstates in 123,125Sb are therefore not due to this\nmode of excitation but are likely the result of collective core de-\nformation effects that are not accounted for in the calculations.\nB. Wave functions and transition probabilities\nExamination of the calculated wave functions of the\nisomeric states indicates that the wave function of the\nJ\u03c0 = 232\n+ isomer in 125Sb can be expressed as |\u0006\n23\n2\n+\nSb \u3009 =\n\u223c74%|\u000610+Sn \u3009 \u2297 \u03c0g 72 , the wave function of the J\u03c0 =\n19\n2\n+\nstate\npopulated by an E2 transition from the J\u03c0 = 232\n+ isomer\ncan be expressed as |\u0006\n19\n2\n+\nSb \u3009 = \u223c70%|\u00068\n+\nSn \u3009 \u2297 \u03c0g 72 , the wave\nfunction of the J\u03c0 = 192\n\u2212 isomer can be expressed as |\u0006\n19\n2\n\u2212\nSb \u3009 =\n\u223c80%|\u00067\u2212Sn \u3009 \u2297 \u03c0g 72 , and the wave function of the J\u03c0 =\n15\n2\n\u2212\nisomers can be expressed as |\u0006\n15\n2\n\u2212\nSb \u3009 = \u223c82%|\u00065\n\u2212\nSn \u3009 \u2297 \u03c0g 72 .\nAnalysis of the wave functions of these states in 121,123,127,129Sb\nand 120,122,126,128Sn show comparable levels of overlap.

The values calculated for\n129,131Sb in the restricted space are in excellent agreement with\nthose obtained from the unrestricted calculations giving further\nfaith in the validity of the approximation.\nFigure 8(a) shows that the calculated values for the\nB(E2 : 232\n+ \u2192 192\n+) (closed squares) agree with the data\n(open squares) to within a factor of three for A > 125 but\ndo not reproduce the rapid drop (approximately two orders of\nmagnitude) between 125Sb and 123Sb. It is of note that the\nexperimental data have the same shape as for the B(E2 :\n10+ \u2192 8+) values in the neighboring even-A tin isotopes\n(circles). The J\u03c0 = 10+ and 8+ states in the even-A tin\nisotopes and the 232\n+\nand 192\n+\nstates in the odd-A antimony\nisotopes have h 11\n2\nneutron configurations. Inspection of the\nlevel schemes shows that theJ\u03c0 = 10+ \u2192 8+ and 232\n+ \u2192 192\n+\ntransitions proceed between states of the same seniority.\nBecause the B(E2) values of these transitions depend critically\non the occupation number of the h 11\n2\norbital, a dependence on\nA is expected. In particular, at the point of half-filling, the\nparticle and hole contributions are equal and so the B(E2)\nvalue reduces to zero [21]. The experimental trend shown in\nFig. 8(a) for 121\u0002A\u0002 124 can therefore be attributed to the\nhalf-filling of the h 11\n2\nneutron orbital at N \u223c 73.\n054306-6\nSTRUCTURE OF THE ISOMERIC STATES IN 123,125Sb PHYSICAL REVIEW C 76, 054306 (2007)\nFigure 8(b) shows the B(E2 : 192\n\u2212 \u2192 152\n\u2212) values in\nantimony (squares) alongside the B(E2 : 7\u2212 \u2192 5\u2212) values in\ntin (circles). No values are shown for 129Sb as the J\u03c0 = 192\n\u2212\nstate is not observed to decay to the 152\n\u2212\nstate. The state\nassigned J\u03c0 = 192\n\u2212 in 127Sb by Porquet et al. [4] is interpreted\nas the J\u03c0 = 232\n+\nstate in the current work. No other J\u03c0 = 192\n\u2212\nstates are known in 127Sb and so no B(E2 : 192\n\u2212 \u2192 152\n\u2212)\nvalue is given for 127Sb. The calculations for antimony (closed\nsquares) clearly reproduce the systematics of the experimental\nvalues, in particular the reduction by two orders of magnitude\nbetween A = 121 and 125 and the increase of the same\nmagnitude between A = 125 and 131. They overestimate\nthe transition probabilities for 121,123Sb by only a factor of\n\u223c8. It is interesting to note that the experimental values for\nB(E2 : 7\u2212 \u2192 5\u2212) (open circles) show the same shape as the\nvalues for B(E2 : 192\n\u2212 \u2192 152\n\u2212) (open squares) but with a shift\nof \u223c6 mass units. The calculated B(E2 : 7\u2212 \u2192 5\u2212) values\n(closed circles) do not reproduce this and indeed overlap with\nthe values for B(E2 : 192\n\u2212 \u2192 152\n\u2212) (squares). This indicates\nthat the calculated wave functions for the isomeric J\u03c0 = 7\u2212\nand J\u03c0 = 5\u2212 states in the even-A tin isotopes do not reflect\nthe experimental ones. This is not related to the truncated\nmodel space as calculations for the tin isotopes performed\nusing the full model space show the same trend. The results\nfor the odd-A antimony isotopes show that the addition of a\nsingle proton enables the calculated wave functions to reflect\nthe experimental wave functions with much greater success.\nThe origin of this anomaly is not clear. However, the\nunderlying feature is that the B(E2) data for the J\u03c0 = 192\n\u2212\nand J\u03c0 = 152\n\u2212\nstates do not support the interpretation of the\nstates in antimony being generated by the simple coupling of\nthe extra proton to the J\u03c0 = 7\u2212 and J\u03c0 = 5\u2212 isomeric states in\nthe tin core, implied by the energy systematics shown in Fig. 1.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nThe half-lives of excited states in 123,125Sb have been\nmeasured and the J\u03c0 values of excited states in 125Sb have been\nconfirmed. The range of nuclei for which Oxbash calculations\ncan be performed has been extended down to 121Sb by the\nchoice of a suitable truncation of the N\/Z = 50\u201382 model\nspace. A comparison of the systematics of the energy levels\nand of the transition probabilities with those of neighboring\nnuclei and with the results of shell-model calculations casts\ndoubt on the previous interpretation of the negative parity\nisomeric states in antimony nuclei as an odd proton coupled\nto isomeric structures in neighboring even-A tin nuclei.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe visitors to the ANU thank the technical and academic\nstaff of the 14UD accelerator at the Australian National\nUniversity for their assistance and hospitality.
