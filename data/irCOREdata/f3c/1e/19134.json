However, the role of lipid antigen binding\nin stabilization and quality control of CD1 heavy chain (HC)\u0002\u00012-\nmicroglobulin (\u00012m) complexes is unclear. Furthermore, the\ndistinct trafficking and loading routes of CD1 proteins take\nthem frommildly acidic pH in early endososmal compartments\n(pH6.0) tomarkedly acidic pH in lysosomes (pH5.0) andback to\nneutral pH of the cell surface (pH 7.4). Here, we present evi-\ndence that the stability of each CD1 HC\u0002\u00012m complex is deter-\nmined by the distinct pH optima identical to that of the intra-\ncellular compartments in which each CD1 isoform resides.\nAlthough stable at acidic endosomal pH, complexes are only\nstable at cell surface pH 7.4 when bound to specific lipid anti-\ngens. The proposed model outlines a quality control program\nthat allows lipid exchange at low endosomal pH without disso-\nciationof theCD1HC\u0002\u00012mcomplex and then stabilizes the anti-\ngen-loaded complex at neutral pH at the cell surface.\nCD1 molecules represent a distinct lineage of antigen-pre-\nsenting molecules that are related to major histocompatibility\ncomplex (MHC)3 class I proteins sharing limited sequence sim-\nilarity and domain organization including a heavy chain (HC)\ncomposed of \u00011, \u00012 and \u00013 domains associated non-covalently\nwith \u00022-microglobulin (\u00022m). Despite these structural similar-\nities, CD1 proteins are functionally distinct because they bind\nand present lipid antigens to elicit T cell-mediated immunity\n(1). Lipid antigen binding is determined by the presence of deep\nhydrophobic grooves in the\u00011 and\u00012 antigen binding domains\nof the CD1 heavy chain. This topology buries the alkyl chains of\nthe antigens below theCD1 surface and exposes the hydrophilic\nhead groups at the CD1 surface, where moieties of the head\ngroup and the CD1 \u0001-helices can be recognized by T cell anti-\ngen receptors. The assembly of CD1 molecules takes place in\nthe endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with the participation of sev-\neral chaperones also involved in the formation of the MHC\nclass I peptide loading complex, namely calnexin, calreticulin,\nand ERp57 (2). In the ER, newly synthesized CD1molecules are\nthought to be loaded with self-lipid antigens after which they\ntraffic to the cell surface along the secretory pathway (3). From\nthe plasma membrane CD1 molecules are internalized and\nrecycle through the endocytic system where lipid antigens are\nbound and exchanged (1). Human CD1a traffics mainly\nthrough early endosomes and the early endocytic recycling\ncompartment where it co-localizes with MHC class I (4, 5). In\ncontrast, mouse (m) CD1d and human (h) CD1b are sorted\nmainly to late endosomes and lysosomeswhere they co-localize\nwithMHC class II proteins (4, 6\u20138). HumanCD1c and to some\nextent hCD1d are distributed more extensively in both early\nand late endocytic compartments (9, 10).\nFor MHC class I molecules, the binding of specific peptide\nantigens is essential to complete the assembly of these com-\nplexes, regulate their exit from the ER and their integrity on the\ncell surface. Indeed, in transporter associated with antigen pro-\ncessing-deficient cells, which are unable to deliver peptides to\nthe ER, the stability ofMHCclass I heavy chain (HC)\/\u00022m com-\nplexes is decreased and empty MHC class I proteins are\nretained in the ER (11, 12). This process functions in part as a\nquality control mechanism and protects the cell from expres-\nsion of incompletely assembled or empty antigen-presenting\nmolecules. Similarly, the stability of MHC class II complexes is\nensured by the invariant chain (Ii), and the CLIP peptide is\nreplaced by peptide antigens that stabilize MHC class II \u0001\/\u0002\nheterodimers (13). However, it is unclear if CD1 molecules can\nbe stabilized by binding of specific lipid antigens. The ER-local-\nized microsomal triglyceride transfer protein has been impli-\ncated in loading self-lipid antigen during assembling of CD1 in\nthe ER (14, 15). In an experimental system, the culture of CD1a\nexpressing cells under serum (lipid)-deficient conditions par-\ntially reduces the surface expression of CD1a (16). These stud-\nies indirectly point to a protective effect of lipids on CD1 sta-\nbility, but so far no studies have directly examined the effect of\nlipid binding on stability of CD1 complexes. Furthermore, the\ndistinct trafficking and loading routes of CD1 proteins take\nthem frommarkedly acidic pH in lysosomes (pH 5.0) to neutral\npH of the cell surface (pH 7.4). Here, we show for the first time\nthat the stability of individual CD1HC\u0002\u00022m complexes is deter-\n* Thisworkwas supported, inwholeor inpart, byNational Institutes ofHealth\nGrants R01 AI 028973 and AI 063428 (to M.

Cells were incubated at 4 \u00b0C\nfor 30 or 10min at room temperature. To quench excess biotin,\nthe cells were incubated for 5 min with 10ml of 0.4 M glycine in\nPBS at room temperature and thenwashed twicewith cold PBS.\nCells (107) were lysed with 2 ml of lysis buffer (0.5% Triton\nX-100, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, and 25 mM Tris, pH 7.4,\nor 50 mM sodium citrate adjusted to pH 7.4, 7.0, 6.5, 6.0, 5.5,\n5.0, or 4.5). All buffers contained protease inhibitors (aproti-\nnin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, antipain dihydrochloride,\nchymostatin, leupeptin, pepstatin A, sodium orthovanadate,\nand sodium fluoride; all from Sigma). After 30\u201345min of incu-\nbation with lysis buffer at 4 \u00b0C, lysates were centrifuged\n(13,000\u0001 g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C) and the supernatants were col-\nlected and incubated as described under \u201cResults\u201d and in the\nfigure legends.\nImmunoprecipitation\u2014Cell lysates (obtained from 5\u0001 105\u2013\n106 cells) were used for each immunoprecipitation (IP). CD1a\nmolecules were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal anti-\nbodies (mAbs): 10H3 (1\u20132 \u0005g\/sample), OKT6 (2\u20134 \u0005g\/sam-\nple), or 10D12 (2\u20134 \u0005g\/sample).

For IP of hCD1d:\u00022m mAbs 42.1.1 (1\u20132 \u0005g\/sam-\nple) or 55.1 (2\u20134 \u0005g\/sample) were used, whereas mAb 75.10\n(5\u201310 \u0005g\/sample) was used for IP of free hCD1d heavy chain.\nmCD1d was precipitated with rat mAb 19G11.2 (0.5\u20131.0\n\u0005g\/sample). MHC class I was immunoprecipitated with mAb\nW6\/32 (1\u20132 \u0005g\/sample), \u00022m with mAb BBM.1 (1\u20135 \u0005g\/sam-\nple), and MHC class II with mAb L243 (0.1\u20130.2 \u0005g\/sample).\nEquivalent amounts of P3 (mouse IgG1), murine myeloma\nmonoclonal IgG2a (Sigma), or rat isotype IgG2b (BD Bio-\nsciences) were used as isotype controls.

After\nincubating overnight at 4 \u00b0C or alternatively 2\u20133 h with rota-\ntion, the beads were washed three times with RIPA buffer (1%\nTriton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.05% deoxycholate, 50 mM Tris, pH\n7.4, 150 mMNaCl), then washed once with 50mMTris (pH 6.8)\nand resuspended in SDS sample buffer (62.5 mM Tris, pH 6.8,\n10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.025% bromphenol blue, and 179 mM\n\u0002-mercaptoethanol).\nElectrophoresis, Immunoblotting, and Protein Detection\u2014\nSamples were loaded on 15% acrylamide SDS-PAGE and run in\na Protean XL apparatus (Bio-Rad) with constant current (50\nmAmp per gel). After electrophoresis, proteins were trans-\nferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes in transfer buffer\n(25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, and 10% methanol) at 25 V over-\nnight in a Trans-Blot Cell (Bio-Rad). After transfer,membranes\nwere blocked with 0.2% Tween 20 in PBS (PBST) and 0.5%\nbovine serum albumin at room temperature for 1 h, incubated\nwith HRP-conjugated streptavidin (ExtrAvidin, 1:20 000;\nSigma;) in PBST for 45min, washed with PBST, and finally blots\nwere developed with Western Lightning Chemiluminescence\nReagent (Perkin Elmer) according to the manufacturer\u2019s\ninstructions.

Cell sur-\nface CD1 molecules were labeled with biotin and cells were\nlysed with 0.5% Triton X-100 (pH 7.4). We performed IP of\nCD1a:HeLa cell transfectant cell lysates incubated at 4 or 37 \u00b0C.\nIncubation of lysates at 37 \u00b0C for\neven 2 h dramatically reduced the\nlevels of CD1a HC\u0002\u00022m complexes\nimmunoprecipitated when com-\npared with incubation at 4 \u00b0C. This\nwas observed when we used three\ndifferent conformation-specific an-\ntibodies that recognize the CD1a\nHC\u0002\u00022m complex, but not the free\nCD1a HC without \u00022m (Fig. 1A,\ncompare lanes 2\u20134 versus 6\u20138, and\nnote the loss of both CD1a HC and\n\u00022m). These results showing disso-\nciation of the CD1a HC\u0002\u00022m com-\nplex at 37 \u00b0C indicate the complex is\nunstable under these experimental\nconditions.\nNext, we examined the stability\nof the CD1b HC\u0002\u00022m complex un-\nder similar conditions. It also dis-\nsociates at 37 \u00b0C, but with slower\nkinetics than CD1a, requiring at\nleast 12\u201324 h after cell lysis (Fig.\n1B, lane 2 versus 5, note the nearly\ncomplete disappearance of CD1b\nHC and \u00022m). As a control, under\nthese same conditions no detectable\nchange in quantity of MHC I\nHC\u0002\u00022m complexes was found (Fig.\n1B, lane 3 versus 6). We also com-\npared the stability of CD1b with\nMHC class II in CD1b-transfected\nC1R cells and found that as in the\ncase of MHC class I, the MHC class\nII heterodimerwas also stable under\nthese conditions (Fig. 1C, lanes 5\nversus 10). The instability of CD1b\nwas confirmed using a separate\npanel of conformation-dependent\nanti-CD1b HC\u0002 2 mAb (BCD1b.1\nand BCD1b3) (Fig. 1C, lanes 2 and\n3 versus 7 and 8, respectively) and\nmAb 4A7.6 (data not shown). To\ncomplement the analysis using\nCD1 HC\u0002\u00022m conformation-de-\npendent mAb, next we used anti-\n\u00022mmAb BBM.1, which recognizes\n\u00022mwhether free or bound to CD1\/\nMHC I heavy chains. In C1R cells,\nMHC I is essentially absent so that\non this cell line the mAb recognizes\nonly free or CD1 bound \u00022m. Strik-\ningly, mAb BBM.1 confirmed the\nreduced stability of the CD1b\nHC\u0002\u00022mcomplex at 37 \u00b0C comparedwith 4 \u00b0C as the quantity of\nco-immunoprecipitated CD1b HC was markedly reduced at\n37 \u00b0C, whereas the total amount of \u00022m was comparable (Fig.\n1C, lane 4 versus 9).

However, in every case\nthe mAb revealed a similar pattern of HC\u0002\u00022m instability at\n37 \u00b0C (Fig. 1, A\u2013C).\nNext, we analyzed the stability of CD1d using three different\nanti-hCD1d mAb (42.1, 55.1, and 75.10) that allowed us to dis-\ntinguish the free CD1d HC from the CD1d HC\u0002\u00022m complex.\nmAb 42.1 is conformation-dependent and recognizes only\nCD1d HC\u0002\u00022m complexes, whereas mAb 75.10 selectively\nbinds the free CD1d HC (17). mAb 55.1 recognizes both pools\nof molecules under different conditions because it recognizes\ntheCD1dHC\u0002\u00022mcomplex (by IP), but it can also recognize the\nfree CD1d HC (by Western blotting, data not shown). In\naccordance with the results obtained for CD1a and CD1b, we\nobserved a reduction in immunoprecipitated CD1d HC\u0002\u00022m\ncomplexes and an increase in free CD1d HC in lysates incu-\nbated for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C (Fig. 1, D and E). When anti-CD1d 42.1\nmAb was used we saw a significant reduction of signal for the\nCD1dHCboth inHeLa:CD1d andC1R:CD1d transfectant cells\n(Fig. 1D, lane 2 versus 7). When the IP was performed with\nanti-CD1d 55.1, which recognizes CD1d HC in a conforma-\ntion-independent manner, we observed a decrease in the \u00022m\nsignal at 37 \u00b0Cbut no change in the signal forCD1dHC (Fig. 1D,\nlane 3 versus 8). This suggests that the CD1d HC\u0002\u00022m complex\ndisassembles without degradation of the HC. If true, then the\nproportion of free CD1d HC should increase. This prediction\nwas confirmed by noting the significant increase in free CD1d\nHC signal by IPwhenwe used anti-CD1d freeHC-specificmAb\n75.10 in samples incubated 37 \u00b0C (Fig. 1D, lanes 4 versus 9). In\nfact, the results obtained with anti-\u00022m BBM1 mAb were also\nconsistent with this interpretation, because the CD1d HC sig-\nnal decreased, although no change in the \u00022m signal was noted\nafter incubating cell lysates for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C (Fig. 1E, lanes 4\nversus 9). Importantly, signals for MHC class I and II were rel-\natively unchanged under these same experimental conditions\n(Fig. 1, E, lanes 5 versus 10 and D, lanes 5 versus 10) although\nMHC I-associated \u00022m labeled only weakly, therefore limiting\nits analysis in this experiment. Together, these data outline con-\nditions under which CD1 molecules labeled at the cell surface\ndissociate after lysis in 0.5% Triton X-100 at 37 \u00b0C compared\nwith MHC I and II molecules under the same conditions.\nThe different times required for disassembly of CD1a\nHC\u0002\u00022m compared with CD1b HC\u0002\u00022m complexes at 37 \u00b0C\nsuggests that each CD1 isoform may vary in its stability. To\naddress this possibility, we used HeLa cells transfected with\ndifferent CD1 proteins. As shown in Fig. 2A, CD1a displayed\nthe lowest stability after 2 h at 37 \u00b0Cwith over 95% dissociation,\nfollowed by CD1d (75%) and CD1c (50%) (Fig. 2, D and C,\nrespectively). CD1b was the most stabile CD1 isoform, with\nonly 10% dissociation after 2 h at 37 \u00b0C (Fig. 2B). We also con-\nfirmed that MHC class I is very stable, showing no significant\nreduction in signal after 2 h at 37 \u00b0C (Fig. 2, A\u2013D).\nFIGURE 2. Rank order of CD1 isoform stability: CD1b> CD1c> CD1d> CD1a. HeLa:CD1a, CD1b, CD1c, or CD1d transfectants were surface biotinylated,\nlysed with 0.5% Triton X-100 (pH 7.4), and then lysates were incubated for 2 h at 4 or 37 \u00b0C. CD1 heavy chain\/\u00022m complexes were immunoprecipitated with\n10H3 (anti-CD1a, A), BCD1b.3 (anti-CD1b, B), F10\/23.A.1 (anti-CD1c, C), or 42.1 (anti-CD1d, D) antibodies, whereas MHC class I:HC\u0002\u00022m complexes were\nprecipitated with antibody W6\/32 (A\u2013D). Mouse IgG1 and IgG2a were used as isotype controls. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (15%) in\nreducing conditions and immunoblotted with streptavidin-HRP. Arrows indicate lanes to compare. Quantification of band intensity was measured by densi-\ntometry using ImageJ software and results were calculated as proportion of HC or \u00022m signals at 37 \u00b0C compared with HC or \u00022m signals at 4 \u00b0C (A\u2013D).\nRole of pH and Lipid Antigen Binding in CD1Molecule Stability\n11940 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 285\u2022NUMBER 16\u2022APRIL 16, 2010\n by guest, on July 17, 2010\nw\nw\nw\n.jbc.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nhttp:\/\/www.jbc.org\/content\/suppl\/2010\/02\/04\/M109.077933.DC1.html\nSupplemental Material can be found at:\nStabilization of CD1a and CD1b HC\u0002\u00022M Complexes by Low\npH\u2014Following biosynthesis in the ER and delivery to the\nplasma membrane, CD1 proteins are then internalized to sur-\nvey endocytic compartments for lipid antigens. CD1a and\nCD1b are exposed to different environments because CD1a\nlocalizes to the endocytic recycling\npathway (pH \u0002 6), whereas CD1b\nlocalizes to lysosomes (pH below\n5.5). To investigate if pH influences\nCD1 stability, CD1-transfected HeLa\ncells were lysed in 0.5% Triton\nX-100 at pH 7.4 or 5.5 and then\nincubated at 37 \u00b0C for various times.\nAs expected, incubation for 24 h at\n37 \u00b0C at pH 7.4 resulted in signifi-\ncant CD1b HC\u0002\u00022m complex disas-\nsembly (Fig. 3A, lane 2 versus 5).\nSurprisingly, when lysis was per-\nformed at pH 5.5 the complex was\nmarkedlymore stable than at pH 7.4\nwith CD1b HC 30 versus 90% and\n\u00022m 50 versus 100% of signal de-\ntected at pH 7.4 versus 5.5 (Fig. 3, A\nlane 8 versus 11). Similar results\nwere also obtained using two other\nanti-CD1bmAb, 4A7.6 and BCD1b.1\n(not shown). In striking contrast to\nCD1b stability at acidic pH, theMHC\nclass I HC\u0002 2m complex was much\nless stable at pH 5.5 (Fig. 3A, lane 9\nversus 12). Thus, CD1b HC\u0002 2m\ncomplex stability is greater in lowpH,\nwhereas the opposite is true for the\nMHC class I HC\u0002 2m.\nIn a similar way, we found that\nlow pH also protects CD1a HC\u0002\u00022m\ncomplexes from disassembling dur-\ning a period of 2 h at 37 \u00b0C (Fig. 3B,\nlane 2 versus 5 and 8 versus 11).\nIncubation of lysates at pH 7.4\nmarkedly decreased the signal of\nimmunoprecipitated CD1a HC\u0002\n\u00022m complexes (reduction over\n95%), whereas incubation at pH 5.5\npartially protected CD1a from dis-\nassembly (reduction of 50\u201360%).\nThe same result was also obtained\nusing two other anti-CD1a mAb,\n10D12 and OKT6 (not shown).\nIn contrast to CD1a and CD1b,\nvery little if any protection from dis-\nassembly was found at pH 5.5 for\nhuman CD1d HC\u0002\u00022m complexes\n(Fig. 3C, lane 2 versus 5 and 8 versus\n11). Consistent with disassembly of\nthe complex, we simultaneously de-\ntected an increase in free CD1d HC\nimmunoprecipitatedwithmAb 75.10\n(Fig. 3C, lane 3 versus 6 and 9 versus 12). pH does not affect anti-\nbody binding efficiency because the amount of immunoprecipi-\ntatedCD1 andMHCclass I was similar at 4 \u00b0C (Fig. 3,A\u2013D).

Thus, we lysed CD1b-trans-\nfected HeLa cells in pH 5.5 buffer, incubated the lysates for\n3 h at 37 \u00b0C, and then rapidly neutralized the cells to pH 7.4.\nThen, after further incubation at 37 \u00b0C (pH 7.4) for 9 h, we\nimmunoprecipitated CD1b and MHC class I with specific\nmAb. As a control, we analyzed samples incubated at 4 or\n37 \u00b0C for 12 h, without the neutralization step. The incuba-\ntion of lysates in low pH for 3 h followed by 9 h at neutral pH\nrevealed instability of CD1b HC\u0002\u00022m complexes (about 85%\nreduction of CD1b HC) when compared with lysates incu-\nbated at low pH throughout the experiment (Fig. 3D, lane 2\nversus 8). These results suggest that the effect of pH on sta-\nbility of the CD1 HC\u0002\u00022m complex is reversible and does not\ncause a permanent change in protein structure. In summary,\nthe evidence suggests that pH 5.5 markedly stabilizes of\nCD1a and CD1b HC\u0002\u00022m complexes but does not have a\nsignificant influence on CD1d. This pH-dependent protec-\ntive effect is reversible.\npH-dependent Protection of CD1Molecules Corresponds with\nTheir Locations in Intracellular Compartments\u2014Given the\nprotection of CD1a and CD1b HC\u0002\u00022m complexes noted at pH\n5.5, we tested a range of pH to determine the optimum for\nstability of each CD1 isoform.We lysed cells at pH 7.4, 7.0, 6.5,\n6.0, 5.5, 5.0, or 4.5 and then incubated lysates at 4 or 37 \u00b0C for\ndifferent times. This pH range was selected to cover the typical\npH encountered at the plasma membrane (pH 7.4) or in the\nearly endosomes (pH 6.0) and lysosomes (pH 5.5) where CD1\nisoforms traffic.\nRemarkably, each CD1 isoform displayed a different opti-\nmum pH for stability (Fig. 4, A\u2013C). A maximum protective\neffect for CD1a was achieved at pH 6.0, with some protection\noccurring also at pH 5.5. In the case of the CD1bHC\u0002\u00022m com-\nplex, a broader range of protection from disassembling by pH\nwas observedwithmaximal protection seen at a pHbetween 5.0\nand 5.5. CD1c achieves the maximum stability at pH 6.5 with a\nsecond peak of protection at pH 5.0 and 5.5 (Fig. 4, A and B).\nThese results confirm that low pH stabilizes CD1a, -b, and -c\nHC\u0002\u00022m complexes from disassembly at 37 \u00b0C. Strikingly, the\nmaximum protection for each CD1 isoform is equivalent to the\npHof the intracellular compartment where that particular CD1\nFIGURE 4. pH-dependent protection of CD1 molecules corresponds to their locations in intracellular compartments.

CD1a, which localizes to\nearly recycling endosomes that are typically between of pH 6.0\nand 6.5, achieves its maximum protection in pH 6.0. CD1b,\nwhich localizes to lysosomes, shows maximum protection at\npH 5 to 5.5. Remarkably, CD1c, which is broadly distributed\nfrom early to late endosomes and lysosomes, shows significant\nprotection across a broader pH range than the other CD1\nisoforms.\nTo further test the hypothesis that each CD1 isoform is\nmost stable at the pH of its steady state endosomal localiza-\ntion site, we compared the pH dependence of human (h) and\nmouse (m) CD1d HC\u0002\u00022m complex stability. As noted above,\nthe effect of pH on hCD1d was distinct compared with that\nobserved for the group I CD1 molecules. Human CD1d only\npartially localizes to LAMP-1 compartments (18), whereas\nmouse CD1d strongly associates with AP3 (7, 8) and pre-\ndominantly localizes to LAMP-1 compartments (19). Thus\nmCD1d is more similar in steady state localization to hCD1b\nthan hCD1d. To examine the effect of pH on hCD1d and\nmCD1d HC\u0002\u00022m complex stability, we used hCD1d-trans-\nfected HeLa cells and mCD1d-transfected RAW cells. First,\nwe found that mCD1d is more stable after cell lysis than\nhCD1d, requiring at least 12 h for a significant reduction in\nthe signal of the HC\u0002\u00022m complex (Fig. 5, A versus B). This\nhigher stability of mCD1d is also more similar to CD1b than\nhCD1d. When we incubated lysates from CD1d-transfected\ncells at different pH at 37 \u00b0C (Fig. 5 and data not shown), we\nfound pH-dependent protection from disassembly for both\nhuman and mouse CD1d HC\u0002\u00022m complexes. However, the\npH that protects mCD1d was significantly lower than in the\ncase of hCD1d and closer to CD1b (Fig. 5). The effect of pH\non the stability of hCD1d was less dramatic than observed in\nthe case of the humanCD1a, -b, and -c isoforms (Figs. 5Aversus\n4), but nevertheless, the hCD1 HC\u0002\u00022m complex was still more\nstable at endosomal pH (between 6.5 and 6.0) than at neutral\npH. Thus, the pH at which each CD1 isoformHC\u0002\u00022m complex\nis protected from disassembly remarkably corresponds to the\npH of the compartment where each isoform is predominantly\nlocalized in the cell at steady state.\nCD1 HC\u0002\u00022M Complexes Are Stabilized by Specific Lipid\nAntigens\u2014Amajor factor in the stability of MHC molecules is\npeptide binding. In fact, in the absence of high affinity binding\npeptides, MHC class I and II heterodimers either fail to com-\nplete folding and\/or are prone to dissociate. To study the pos-\nsible role of specific lipid antigens in the stabilization of CD1\nHC\u0002\u00022m complexes we determined if \u0001-galactosylceramide\n(\u0001-GalCer) could protect hCD1d from disassembling at 37 \u00b0C.\nEighty percent of the hCD1d HC\u0002\u00022m complexes disassemble\nwhen the lysates are incubated at 37 \u00b0C (pH7.4) for 2 h (see Figs.\n1 and 2) and in this experiment over 95% dissociation occurred\n(Fig. 6A, compare \u00022m in lanes 2 versus 6). To determine\nwhether \u0001-GalCer can protect CD1d HC\u0002\u00022m complexes from\ndisassembly, we lysed CD1d-transfected HeLa cells and incu-\nbated the lysates at 4 or 37 \u00b0C for 2 h at pH 7.4 in the presence or\nabsence of \u0001-GalCer. The addition of \u0001-GalCer to the lysates\nduring incubation at 37 \u00b0C markedly stabilized the CD1d\nFIGURE 5. Effect of low pH on stability of human and mouse CD1d.

In contrast, the addition of\u0001-GalCer hadno effect onMHC\nclass I HC\u0002\u00022m complex stability (Fig. 6A, compare lane 8 ver-\nsus lanes 12, 16, 20, and 24). The quantification of CD1d\nHC\u0002\u00022m complex (42.1 mAb) and free CD1d HC (75.10 mAb)\nunderscores the protective effect of \u0001-GalCer on CD1d\nHC\u0002\u00022m disassembly as shown in Fig. 6B. In samples incubated\nwithout or with low concentrations of \u0001-GalCer, the ratio of\nCD1d HC\u0002\u00022m complex to free CD1d HC is lower than 0.7,\nwhereas this ratio increases progressively with rising concen-\ntrations of lipid antigen until it reaches a value of 1.47 at 50\n\u0005g\/ml of \u0001-GalCer (Fig. 6B). Similar results were obtained with\nC1R:CD1d transfectants (supplemental Fig. S1). It should be\nnoted that protection from dissociation of the CD1d HC\u0002\u00022m\ncomplex was not complete, even at the highest concentrations\nof \u0001-GalCer tested (100 \u0005g\/ml) (Fig. 6B and data not shown).\nThis could be due to the incomplete ability of \u0001-GalCer to pre-\nvent HC\u0002\u00022m dissociation or perhaps more likely insufficient\nloading under our experimental conditions. Nevertheless, the\ndata strongly indicates that dose-dependent binding of a spe-\ncific lipid antigen protects the CD1d HC\u0002\u00022m complex from\ndisassembling.\nNext, we sought to determine whether specificity of the lipid\nwas important in CD1d complex stability. It was possible that\nstabilization of CD1d seen with \u0001-GalCer results from a non-\nspecific effect of lipid that is not related to specific binding of\n\u0001-GalCer to CD1d. To examine this, we tested the effect of C80\ntrehalose monomycolate because it is predicted to be too long\nto pack into the hCD1dbinding groves (20). First, we confirmed\nCD1dHC\u0002\u00022m complex stabilization at 37 \u00b0C in the presence of\n\u0001-GalCer in a dose-dependent manner (supplemental Fig. S2).\nIn contrast, trehalose monomycolate had no effect across a\nbroad concentration range on CD1dHC\u0002\u00022m complex stability\n(supplemental Fig. S2D). This result supports the specific sta-\nbilization of the CD1d HC\u0002\u00022m complex by \u0001-GalCer.\nNext, we further confirmed the role of lipid antigen binding\non stability of a second CD1 isoform, CD1b, and evaluated how\nthe dual factors, pH and lipid antigen binding, might cooperate\nin stabilizing this HC\u0002\u00022m complex.We tested if C32 (GMM), a\nCD1b-presented antigen isolated from M. tuberculosis, could\nstabilize CD1b molecules. We surface biotinylated CD1b-\ntransfectedC1R cells, lysed them in 0.5%TritonX-100 adjusted\nto pH 5.5, and incubated the cells at 37 \u00b0C for 15 h in the pres-\nence or absence of C32 GMM, in increasing concentrations.\nThis first incubation was performed at pH 5.5 as this pH favors\nlipid exchange (21) and we also showed this pH stabilizes the\nCD1bHC\u0002\u00022m complex. After a 3-h incubation at 37 \u00b0C, the pH\nof samples was then neutralized and the lysates were incubated\nfor another 12 h at 37 \u00b0C, and stability of the CD1b HC\u0002\u00022m\ncomplexes was assessed by quantitating the CD1b HC that was\nco-immunoprecipitated with anti-\u00022m-specific mAb BBM.1.\nIn addition, similar aliquots of lysate were incubated at 4 \u00b0C as\nbaseline controls for the 37 \u00b0C sample (Fig. 6, C and D). Con-\nfirming the previous result, we found that the CD1b HC signal\nwas reduced in samples incubated at 37 \u00b0C compared with 4 \u00b0C\nat neutral pH (Fig. 6C, compare lane 1 versus 2). Furthermore,\nsamples maintained at acidic pH 5.5 were also stable even at\n37 \u00b0C (Fig. 6C, lane 5). Importantly, we found that addition of\nGMM to the cell lysates substantially protected the CD1b\nHC\u0002\u00022m complexes from disassembly when the pH was raised\nto 7.4 (Fig. 6C, lane 6 versus 7\u201312) and this protective effect was\ndose-dependent (Fig. 6D). In contrast, incubation of lysates\nwith equivalent concentrations of \u0001-GalCer did not alter the\nstability of the CD1b HC\u0002\u00022m complex (supplemental Fig. S3).\nTogether these results show that the loading of specific lipid\nantigens, such as C32 GMM, stabilizes the CD1b complex in a\nmanner similar to the protection of the CD1d complex by\n\u0001-GalCer. It suggests amodel for the sequence of events during\nCD1 intracellular trafficking (Fig. 7). We propose that when\nCD1molecules localize to the endocytic compartment inwhich\nthey survey lipids, the CD1 HC\u0002\u00022m complex is stabilized by\nendosomal or lysosomal pH. This low pH-mediated stabiliza-\ntion of the CD1HC\u0002\u00022m complex allowsHC\u0002\u00022m complexes to\nremain intact during lipid exchange when the groove might be\ntemporarily empty. Then, when properly loadedwith an appro-\npriate lipid antigen, the CD1 HC\u0002\u00022m complex traffics to the\ncell surface. At the cell surface, CD1 complexes encounter neu-\ntral pH but no longer require low pH stabilization because the\npresence of lipid in the binding groove provides stability at neu-\ntral pH. This model also supports a potential quality control\nmechanism in which CD1HC\u0002\u00022m complexes without stabiliz-\ning lipid antigens that reach the cell surface are prone to disso-\nciate and have a shortened half-life (Fig. 7).\nDISCUSSION\nFor both MHC class I and II, the binding of high affinity\npeptides completes assembly and favors expression of the most\nstable MHC complexes on the cell surface (22) and increases\nFIGURE 6.

On the other hand,\nunloadedMHCmolecules disassemble after a few hours at 4 \u00b0C\n(24). Thus, their quality control mechanism focuses on peptide\nbinding dependent stability.\nHowever, the role of lipid binding by CD1molecules and the\nconditions that result in stable or unstable CD1 HC\u0002\u00022m com-\nplexes are not known. Previously, an important role for pH was\nidentified as a factor influencing antigen loading or exchange\n(25, 26), and two types of accessory molecules, microsomal tri-\nglyceride transfer protein (14) and saposins were shown to facil-\nitate the loading of lipids onto CD1 molecules (27\u201329). It is\ngenerally assumed that self-lipid antigens are first bound to\nCD1 in the ER and then foreign lipid antigens may be ex-\nchanged for self-lipid antigens in endosomal compartments.\nSeveral studies have indirectly implicated lipid loading of CD1\nmolecules as important for CD1HC\u0002\u00022m complex stability. For\nexample, decreased surface expression of CD1 in dendritic cells\nwas observed if microsomal triglyceride transfer protein func-\ntion was impaired (15) and decreased surface recognition of\nCD1a by mAb was noted in cells cultured under serum\/lipid-\ndeficient conditions and could be reversed by adding of CD1a-\nspecific sulfatide antigen (16).\nHere under various conditions tested, CD1 molecules were\nfound to be less stable than MHC class I and II molecules after\nlysis at neutral pH. To examineCD1HC\u0002\u00022m complex stability,\nwe developed experimental systems controlling pH, tempera-\nture, and detergent tomodel critical factors that influence com-\nplex stability. CD1HC\u0002\u00022m complexes were noted to disassem-\nble after a period of several hours at 37 \u00b0C, under conditions\nwhereMHC I and II complexeswere very stable. AlthoughCD1\nmolecules (with the exception of\nhCD1d) are stable at 4 \u00b0C or room\ntemperature for up to 3 days (not\nshown), the complexes readily dis-\nsociate after cell lysis at neutral\npH when warmed to 37 \u00b0C. Because\nthe CD1 isoforms localize to differ-\nent endocytic compartments before\nthey recycle to the plasma mem-\nbrane, we realized that they encoun-\nter markedly different pH in each\nlocation. This led us to investigate\nthe possibility that pH influences\nthe stability of CD1 HC\u0002\u00022m com-\nplexes at 37 \u00b0C. We found that each\nCD1 isoform is optimally stable in\nvitro at a different pH. CD1a and\nhCD1d are maximally stable at pH\n6.0, whereas the effect on CD1b is\nmaximal at a pH between 5.0 and\n5.5. For CD1c stabilization was\nnoted from pH 6.5 to 5.5. Interest-\ningly, the pH at which each isoform\nis maximally protected corresponds\nremarkably well to the pH of the\nintracellular compartment where\nthe particular CD1 isoform localizes\nat steady state. The pH of the endo-\ncytic recycling compartment, where CD1a is found, is esti-\nmated between 6.0 and 6.5. Lysosomes, where CD1b localizes,\nhave a pH lower than 5.5. CD1c and hCD1d show a broader\nintracellular distribution with some accumulation in early\nendosomes and endocytic recycling compartments, as well\nas in late endosomes and lysosomes. Moreover, mouse\nCD1d, which contrary to its human ortholog, accumulates\nalmost exclusively in LAMP-1 positive compartments, is\nprotected across a range of lower pH, down to pH 5.0, like\nhCD1b, which has a similar lysosomal intracellular localiza-\ntion. Therefore, our results suggest that the physiologic pH\nwhere CD1 molecules are normally localized stabilizes their\nsubunit structure. This is likely to be important because it\nwould be desirable for CD1 HC\u0002\u00022m complexes to remain\nintact at endosomal pH to provide a pool of molecules ready\nfor lipid antigen binding. We suggest that the pH-dependent\nprotection mechanism shown here could represent a physi-\nological stabilization mechanism for molecules awaiting\nlipid binding (if empty) or lipid exchange (Fig. 7). Furthermore,\nwe demonstrated that specific lipid antigens can stabilize CD1\nHC\u0002\u00022m complexes in detergent lysates at pH 7.4 and 37 \u00b0C,\nconditions under which they would otherwise disassemble. For\nexample, the hCD1d HC\u0002\u00022m complex is protected from dis-\nassembly by \u0001-GalCer in a dose-dependent manner and the\nintegrity of the CD1b HC\u0002\u00022m complex is protected by\nGMM (Fig. 6). Thus, successful lipid loading generates stable\nCD1 HC\u0002\u00022m\u0002lipid complexes that are no longer dependent\non endosomal pH stabilization. It is also likely that lipids\nwith varying affinities for binding to CD1 may correspond-\ningly provide varying levels of complex stability.\nFIGURE 7. Regulation of CD1 HC\u0002\u00012m complex stability and quality control. A, mechanisms of the CD1\nstability. At neutral pH in the absence of lipid antigen the CD1 HC\u0002\u00022m complex is unstable (upper panel). At\nendosomal (acidic) pH, the CD1 HC\u0002\u00022m complex is relatively more stable (middle panel). At endosomal pH,\nlipid antigen binding or exchange is facilitated, resulting in formation of the CD1HC\u0002\u00022m\/lipid complex that is\nvery stable even in neutral pH (lower panel). B, quality control model based on regulation of CD1 HC\u0002\u00022m\ncomplex stability. In endosomal compartments, empty CD1 molecules are stabilized by low pH providing a\npool of molecules available for binding lipid antigen. CD1 molecules loaded with proper lipid antigens in\nendosomal compartments form stable HC\u0002\u00022m\/lipid complexes that can traffic to the cell surface and remain\nstable at neutral pH. On the other hand, CD1 molecules that are empty or loaded with poor quality lipid are\nprone to dissociate at neutral pH, which would result in a shortened half-life at the cell surface. Relatively\nunstable complexes are depicted in blue and stable complexes are black.\nRole of pH and Lipid Antigen Binding in CD1Molecule Stability\n11946 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 285\u2022NUMBER 16\u2022APRIL 16, 2010\n by guest, on July 17, 2010\nw\nw\nw\n.jbc.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nhttp:\/\/www.jbc.org\/content\/suppl\/2010\/02\/04\/M109.077933.DC1.html\nSupplemental Material can be found at:\nTogether, these results suggest the existence of two com-\nplementary and cooperative mechanisms for stabilizing CD1\nprotein complexes. Namely, CD1 HC\u0002\u00022m localized in endo-\ncytic compartments at steady state are stabilized by the lower\npH encountered in these compartments. When lipid loading\/\nexchange occurs in endosomal compartments the CD1 HC\u0002\n\u00022m\u0002lipid complexes are further stabilized so that they are\ncompetent to withstand the \u201chigher\u201d pH found at the cell\nsurface where T cell recognition occurs. Quality control is\ninherently suggested by this model because CD1 HC\u0002\u00022m\ncomplexes that are not stabilized by lipid antigen binding\nwould be predicted to disassemble andhave a shorter half-life at\nthe cell surface (Fig. 7).\nAcknowledgments\u2014We thank Dr. M.
