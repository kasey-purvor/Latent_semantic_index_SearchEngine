(138) \n \nKey words: International assignments, career support, expatriates, careers, MNE \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n2 \n \nIntroduction \n \nInternational assignments, which involve the transfer of employees internationally within a \nmultinational enterprise, represent a key form of international migration in the global economy. This \nform of migration differs from other forms in a number of important respects. First, the international \nassignment (IA) is typically supported by the organization. This support can range from assistance \nwith taxation and visas, to support with the physical move, to help with job search or finding schools \nfor the spouse and family, to generous reward packages when on assignment. Second, the \ninternational move is generally premised on the expectation that the IA will return to their home \ncountry on completion of their assignment. Finally in contrast to most other forms of migration, \nexpatriates enjoy a relatively privileged position in the labor market. They are normally moving to a \nguaranteed position within the organization and hence compare rather favorably to international \nmigrants who may be motivated by social or political factors and may move to another location \nwithout the guarantee of a job or without organizational support (c.f. Gammage, 2008; Marfleet, \n2006). While the term \u201cinternational assignee\u201d sometimes is deployed in ethnocentric terms to refer \nto parent country national expatriates, we use it to indicate international flows of staff more \ngenerally. We are primarily concerned with traditional long term assignments (3 to 5 years) as \nopposed to alternative forms of international assignments (see Collings et al, 2007). For the \npurposes of this paper, we utilize the terms expatriate and international assignee interchangeably. \nThis paper brings together a diverse authorial team (two academics and two practitioners), with \ndistinct perspectives and experiences and different interests in the international assignment experience. \nAs academics, Collings and Doherty have researched extensively the nature of IAs. Collings has taken a \nlargely organizational focus in much of his work and has sought to understand the use and management \nof the international assignment in the contemporary MNE. Doherty with a background in psychology has \nfocused on unpacking and understanding the career implications of IAs both from individual and \norganizational perspectives. Complementing the academic angle, Luethy and Osborn add significant \npractical experience of managing international staff transfers. In her role as dual career advisor at a \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n3 \n \nleading Swiss university, Luethy works closely with faculty recruited internationally to facilitate their \ntransition to the Swiss culture and maximize the likelihood of their continued engagement with the \norganization. Osborn brings diverse experience from a number of different roles including working for a \nlarge organization that sends individuals and teams on short and longer term IAs and as a business and \ncareer coach working with individuals who are contemplating or in the process of accepting and \nundertaking an IA. Thus, in this paper we aim to accentuate how combining insights from the academic \nliterature and currently unpublished examples of practice can illuminate some of the issues faced by \nindividuals working in an international context. We provide some specific examples of how these people \ncan be supported. \nOur intention is not to provide a comprehensive review of all relevant themes within the \ninternational assignment literature (for recent reviews see Collings et al, 2009; Harvey & Moeller, 2009). \nRather, in contrast with much of the literature on IAs which tends to be premised on organizational \nobjectives, we take an individual focus, highlighting the utility of this complementary view and analysis. \nHowever, as Schein (1971), has long since argued, careers represent the reciprocal interface of the \nindividual on the organization and the organization on the individual.  Therefore, we consider the \nbackground of the corporate context as important in framing our focus on expatriate career experiences, \nconsidering in particular how people pursuing expatriate careers (or at least, expatriate career episodes) \ncan be supported before, during and after an international assignment. We see our engagement with the \nliterature as informed not only by conceptual analysis, but significantly by our practical experience. We \nexplore the support and help needed and what is available to assist international assignees in \naddressing the challenges they face. In some instances our different perspectives demonstrate the \ntensions between the rhetoric of proposed good practice and the reality of this complex experience.  We \nconclude the article with some directions for future study, where the review of current literature and \npractice has highlighted important gaps. \nMuch extant literature on the international assignment has been framed around the global \nassignment cycle, an established frame of reference for organizational practices in the management of \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n4 \n \nIAs. This model has considerable currency as an organizing frame from the corporate perspective, \nproviding a sound basis for organizational planning and management, while facilitating the design and \nimplementation of organizationally driven interventions and support systems linked to how corporate \nentities disaggregate the expatriation process. It separates the temporal frame into three key stages: \npre, during and post assignment, and takes a disjointed approach to the expatriation event, emphasizing \neither individual or organizational views in isolation.  We contend that individual career concerns, \nsubjective career needs and changing ambitions frame career support needs over the entire timescale. \nTherefore it is important to acknowledge these needs, to provide support where possible or at least fund \nit and allow time for it. \nWithout doubt, undertaking an international assignment involves significant transitions (Nicholson, \n1984). Discontinuity and change are driven by the requirements of the role, the psychological \ndispositions and character of the individual, and the organizational induction or socialization practices in \nplace. The theoretical foundation for practice to address the need for support throughout an international \nassignment episode have been built on the potential personal disruption and conflict prompted by \nmoving to a foreign location and the adjustments necessary to overcome the issues surfaced by such a \nmove for both the individual and their family. \nThere are several key transition points which prompt perceptions of high uncertainty and risk for \ninternational assignees. These include the point at which the person decides to accept an assignment, \nthe time of the move to the new context, and on repatriation (Haslberger & Brewster, 2009). \nUncertainties on the individual\u2019s behalf may be exacerbated by perceptions of the support (or lack \nthereof) on offer from the organization, highlighting the importance of the temporal positioning of career \nsupport mechanisms in the assignment. Many of the challenges from the individual perspective are \ncontinuous, often pertinent well before and well after the assignment. Further, the transitions implied can \npotentially extend far beyond the organizational horizons of change and also impact at a much deeper \nlevel, in particular on individual expectations. This has implications for the need for support, the type of \nsupport and how support can help at the individual level. Thus, arguably theoretical perspectives at the \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n5 \n \nindividual level may shed some useful light on the processes at play which would have an impact on the \nutility of any support provided.  \nFor example based on extensive experience of managing global mobility the UK\u2019s Royal Mail \nConsulting (an internal consultancy arm of the United Kingdom Royal Mail, with  around 1000 \nconsultants, with up to 30-40 on IAs at any one time), argued that the time frame over which support and \nsubsequent career impact are tracked, should ideally extend from up to one year before taking the \nassignment, right through to at least five years after the assignment and, in many cases, for the \nremainder of that individual\u2019s career. Interventions such as pre-departure training and home country \nmentors can assist the assignee in preparing for the assignment and provide a sense of anticipatory \nadjustment. However, the support required may alter once the actual move takes place. This is \nillustrated in the \u2018guidelines\u2019 which were prepared by the  Royal Mail Consulting, which identified the kind \nof support necessary at each stage of the international assignment process (see table 1). This check list \ncan be used by all those involved in the process, and while not guaranteeing the quality of support \nprovided, it does signal to individuals and managers what is required and should be available.  \nThe Assignment Deal \nWe begin by considering the initial decision to undertake an assignment. The IA is often endorsed \nas a mutually beneficial episode, fulfilling both the organizational need to gain competitive advantage \nand as an important mechanism for individual development (Larsen, 2004). From an organizational \nperspective, Edstrom & Galbraith (1977) identified three key motives for the deployment of international \nassignees. Firstly, as position fillers where the skills required of a position are not available in the host \ncountry. Secondly, as a form of organizational development, this motive has strong resonance with \ncontrol and coordination objectives (Harzing, 2001). Thirdly, as a means of management development, \nfocused on developing the skill set of the individual assignee. The first two types can broadly be \nclassified as demand driven, while the third could more squarely be considered learning driven. We \nargue that the distinction between demand driven and learning driven assignments is significant and has \nheretofore been underutilized in the context of expatriate careers research. It also has significant \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n6 \n \nimplications for the type of support required. For example, an assignee deployed for demand purposes \nmay justifiably be selected on the basis of their technical competence, however they may require \nsignificant support in the softer skills required to adjust to the host country and to transfer their \nknowledge to the host employees as there is often a strong teaching focus in these roles (Evans et al., \n2011). In contrast, those selected for learning driven assignments may require a greater degree of \nsupport in assimilating learning opportunities from the host country and facilitating the application of this \nknowledge when they repatriate. \n \nThe Assignment Offer \nThe assignment offer is the first stage at which the requirement for support of the international \nassignee emerges. The decision to accept an international assignment deal can be framed as a trade \noff, an attempt by the individual to optimize between risk and career success in the context of their life \nchoices (Nicholson, 2007). However, empirical evidence (Kraimer et al, 2009: 42; Stahl et al, 2009) \nconfirms that developmental assignments appear to have greater career enhancing effects than other \nforms of assignment and may be a significant area where individual and organizational goals can \npotentially overlap (Dickmann & Doherty, 2010). Thus, we argue that career counseling and coaching \nrepresent effective supports in assisting individuals in weighing up the potential costs and benefits to \nthem and the likely career outcomes of accepting the assignment (Yan et al, 2002).  \nThe stage of offer and acceptance is significant to the development of the psychological contract \nbetween the assignee and the organization. Indeed, there is often a discord between organizational and \nindividual goals in expatriation which may explain some of the recently highlighted paradoxes of \ninternational working where the anticipated benefits for individuals and organizations often remain unmet \n(Dickmann & Harris, 2005; Dickmann & Doherty 2008; Doherty et al, 2008). Realistic framing of the \npsychological contract is key (Yan et al, 2002).   \nWhatever the motivation for the assignment, it is important that it is congruent with the individual\u2019s \npersonal values, career drivers and medium and longer term career goals. This personal career \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n7 \n \nsymmetry should facilitate their continued motivation and commitment in the face of difficulties and \nchallenges because they are clear about their part of \u2018the deal\u2019. For some assignees the psychological \ncontract may be perceived as solely transactional. In return for completing an assignment for a number \nof years, they expect to gain increased rewards and an excellent quality of life while on assignment. For \nexample, there are many who have taken 3-5 year IAs, typically in the Middle East, simply to earn as \nmuch as they can with little or no tax, so that they can complete the assignment and return with a lump \nsum of cash. However, for others, the contract may be perceived as more relational, where there is an \nexpectation that the assignment is the basis of a longer term employment relationship with career \nprogression within the organization on completion (Yan et al, 2002). Although the expectation of career \nadvancement on repatriation is often more implied than explicit (Doherty & Dickmann,  2009), it has \nbeen argued that career development is the key long term concern of the assignee in formulating their \npsychological contract in the context of an international assignment (Yan et al, 2002: 377). However, a \nfailure to achieve subsequent career advancement within the organization can lead to a breach and \nultimately a violation of the assignee\u2019s psychological contract (Yan et al, 2002).  \nIn practice, there are different organizational approaches to assignment management. For \nexample, UK headquartered Reckitt Benckiser has developed a cadre of global managers who have not \nheld jobs in their countries of origins for years. Their top 400 managers represent 53 different \nnationalities and HR practices are developed to facilitate the international transfer of these managers on \na regular basis (Becht, 2010). Individually, some who enjoy the challenge of living and working in \ndifferent places and also enjoy the extra perks that often go with an expatriate assignment, may become \nexpat \u2018junkies\u2019 as they go from one assignment to another. These individuals are wholly suited to living \nabroad but then find the adjustment to coming back difficult or virtually impossible. These nomads make \na career out of successive IAs, where the international episode is not a career enhancing move but a \ncareer in itself.  For others it is not about career at all, but the personal development. This is where the \ncongruence with individual values and alignment with personal goals is important.  It is therefore crucial \nfor the individual, and so by implication for the organization, to ensure that on both sides of the deal \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n8 \n \nthere is clarity of medium and long term goals, stretching beyond the assignment. It is good practice to \nhave open and honest career conversations as early as possible with potential candidates about the \nextent to which expectations for the assignment can be matched, in order to position the deal.  An \nexplicit, detailed statement of organizational expectations helps the individual to compare their own \nexpectations and assess the extent to which the opportunity will provide what they are looking for (in \nterms of career or professional development and for personal\/family life). \nIn practice, the level of \u201cchoice\u201d varies.  For example, one multinational oil company is very explicit \nabout the requirement for its field engineers to be globally mobile. As part of the recruitment process, \nemployees are made aware that the company\u2019s motto with regard to this cohort of employees is \u201cAny \nplace, any time, any why\u201d. Although this seems quite a blunt statement, at least it constitutes a realistic \njob preview (see Morse & Popovich, 2009) for potential employees, who quickly realize that such global \nmobility is a prerequisite for their role in the organization. In a global bank, selection for the \u2018global talent \npool\u2019 reflects confirmation of ability and ambition, but for many creates anxieties about the requirement \nto take any posting chosen by the organization. When the talent pool is reviewed, some report relief at \nbeing cut from the list because this immediately removes the \u2018threat\u2019 of an IA that didn\u2019t suit them or their \ncurrent family circumstances or worse a very difficult IA that would force them to decide whether to stay \nor leave the organization.  This kind of \u2018constant worry\u2019 or career dilemma for individuals is almost \ninevitable in those organizations for which a succession of IAs is integral to career development paths \nand deemed necessary for career progression.  Indeed, Feldman and Thomas (1992) found a positive \nrelationship between perceived free choice as to whether to accept an overseas assignment and \nsuccess on assignment. Similarly, Kraimer and Wayne (2004) found a negative relationship between \nlack of free choice and expatriate adjustment and commitment to the foreign subsidiary.  In these cases, \nextra career support for the individual is extremely important to help with difficult personal decision \nmaking and to avoid creating unnecessary stress, trauma or anxiety This underlines the need for \norganizations, wherever possible to provide appropriate support, as outlined in Table 1, to ensure that \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n9 \n \nindividuals can make regular re-assessments of the value, risks and opportunities of any given \ninternational assignment options.  \nOther factors which emerge as significant in the decision to undertake an international assignment \ninclude marital status, with spouse willingness to relocate being identified as a significant factor in \nexplaining the decision to relocate (Brett et al, 1993; Harvey, 1995). This issue is particularly important \nin the context of dual careers (Harvey, 1995).  For the individual assignee the levels of support afforded \nto spouse and family are fundamental in framing the decision to undertake an assignment and the \ntransition while on assignment. Standard corporate support packages for international assignees have \nlong since provided for children\u2019s education and support for the running of the household in the foreign \nlocation which certainly facilitates the IA and their family (Festing & Perkins, 2008). Direct support for the \nspousal career has in recent decades emerged as increasingly pertinent and the level of support \nprovided for the spousal career by the organization can also have a significant impact on the \nexpatriation event (van der Velde et al, 2005). Harvey (1995: 325-6) summarizes the types of support \nwhich can be provided to trailing spouses. These include; counseling to address the career issues which \ndual-career couples face; assistance in preparation for overseas career opportunities; job support within \nthe MNC or with international counterparts; provision of a realistic \u2018preview\u2019 of international relocation; \nretention of professional international placement assistance; flexibility in housing\/domicile for expatriate \nand spouse and provision of advanced educational opportunities. \nThe issue of dual career support has also emerged as a significant challenge for universities in \nrecent years, and examples from this sector provide useful insights into the types of support requested \nin more traditional corporate settings. In the context of continental Europe, successful academic careers \ngenerally require a number of international moves. These moves may coincide with the transition from \nmasters to PhD, to post doc, to assistant\/associate professor and eventually to full professor. \nSignificantly, this mobility is required by researchers at a relatively young age, which often coincides with \nstarting a family.  Furthermore our experience tells us that researchers often choose a partner who is \nalso working in research or has a high achieving career outside academia. The challenge of combining \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n10 \n \ntwo professional careers is of course extremely difficult. To address this issue, ETH Zurich offers dual \ncareer and relocation advice to its new faculty members. Such support is considered critical to the \nsuccessful recruitment of international faculty in a highly competitive market place. These support \nactivities range from technical and logistical issues (e.g. housing, schooling and child care, insurances, \npension plan and social security, taxes and language barriers), to support for the partner\u2019s career in \nfinding or even creating adequate job opportunities.  \nAt ETH Zurich, no written rules are established in order to facilitate flexibility and this is seen as a \nkey advantage of the system. No standardized support package or approach works satisfactorily to find \nor create a position for a spouse\/partner. The needs of each individual family are too varied to allow this. \nThe career support, which starts during the negotiation phase, that is before the family has actually \ndecided to move, ranges from adapting the CV (resume) to the national standards, making contacts \nwithin their field, introducing the spouse to potential employers, and help with the application process. \nSupport may also be offered in the recognition process of a foreign diploma or help in finding suitable \nfurther education courses or studies which allow longer term integration. As a majority of \nspouses\/partners of faculty members are themselves academics, professional integration within the \ninstitution or another university or research institution is crucial. Where appropriate, a new position within \nETH is created and equipped with start-up money to facilitate the initial phase of about one year. The \nhiring institution then helps the spouse\/partner find alternative sources of funding to finance their \nresearch.  \nApart from the focus on the professional integration of the spouse\/partner, ETH Zurich also offers \nsupport in the integration of the family, which includes finding solutions to housing, school and childcare \nissues, social security, pension and tax aspects as well as other social integration measures. \nExperience shows that a new hire who was successfully supported in the transition phase and whose \nspouse and family consequently are well integrated, has lower intention to leave for another employer. \n \nPreparing for the Assignment \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n11 \n \nOnce an individual has committed to undertaking an international assignment, the requirement for \norganizational support becomes even more apparent.  Preparation for assignment often includes pre-\ndeparture training, briefings, visits to the host location and shadowing. In particular preparation focuses \non the softer skills and cross-cultural competencies required of an IA. This support is often premised on \nthe importance of the IA\u2019s adjustment when on assignment in determining their performance during the \nassignment (see Thomas & Lazarova, 2006). In this regard, factors such as tolerance for stress, \nrelational skills, communication skills, and language skills have been identified as important \nrequirements of cross cultural adjustment which can be developed through pre-departure training (see \nEhnert & Brewster, 2008; Parkinson & Morley, 2006 for useful summaries). Much of this pre-departure \ntraining is geared to providing a greater understanding of the cultural norms of the host country and \nfacilitating the development of appropriate behaviors to utilize in cross-cultural interactions. The nature \nand degree of the IA\u2019s interaction with host nationals, and the level of difference between the IA\u2019s home \nculture and the culture in the host are also significant in determining the nature of the training required \n(Tung, 1982). In ideal circumstances this training should begin well in advance of the assignment: for \nexample Royal Mail suggested up to six months in advance. However, in practice assignees are often \ndeployed on a short-term reactive basis, rather than in a planned strategic way and such foresight is not \nalways possible, so pre-departure preparation is not always borne out in reality, with few companies \napplying good practice fully or consistently (Harris & Brewster, 1999).  Thus, the type and extent of \nprovision of career support for individuals who are contemplating an international assignment and also \nfor those who actually take up assignments is quite variable. Indeed, given that the most prominent \ncriterion utilized in the selection of international assignees is technical competence, which tends to be a \npoor predictor of suitability for and performance on international assignment, the requirement for \nappropriate pre-departure training is amplified. Where there is a lack of support for the softer skills, the \nimpact of culture shock for the person and often their accompanying family can profoundly color their \nexperience and their career outcomes. \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n12 \n \nFrom a corporate perspective, offering support to new hires and their families is therefore a key \nrecruiting element which can encourage the candidate to accept an offer. Any investment, whether time \nor money, will help to attract the best hires and keep them within the organization. It is therefore \nadvisable for support to continue once the family relocates and indeed for them to be allowed to draw on \nthe support services for a minimum of a year, and ideally throughout the assignment. Over time, the \nsupport and coaching shifts from offering practical support with housing, schooling, childcare and \nprofessional integration issues of the spouse\/partner to supporting social integration. This can include \nlanguage and intercultural courses, the organization of events and outings, or networking events which \nintroduce the expatriates to the new culture and country and allows them to build new networks and find \nnew friends.  This is reflective of the fact that pre-departure training in itself is unlikely to be sufficient in \naddressing all of the issues that may emerge while on assignment. Thus, in-country training can provide \nongoing support for the assignee while on assignment (Mendenhall & Stahl, 2000).   \nMore generally, while mentoring is typically associated with maintaining links with the HQ during \nassignment, it also emerges as significant in supporting the assignee prior to undertaking the \nassignment. The role of a home country mentor has been linked to providing the expatriate with valuable \ninsights into the host country, while reducing unrealistic expectations around the upcoming assignment, \nduring the anticipatory adjustment stage prior to departure (Feldman & Thomas, 1992; Mezias & \nScandura, 2005). Empirically, Carraher, Sullivan and Crocitto (2008) demonstrated the significant and \npositive correlation between having a home country mentor and organizational knowledge, job \nperformance on assignment and promotion potential of the assignee, highlighting the positive role which \nsuch mentoring relationships can provide before the assignment begins.  \n \nSupport During Assignment \nOur focus now turns to the international assignee\u2019s experience while on assignment. Traditionally \nthe expatriation literature has differentiated between three types of adjustment which expatriates face \nwhile on assignment. These are (i) general adjustment relating to the overall non-work environment, \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n13 \n \nincluding issues such as food and transport; (ii) environmental adjustment, which concerns interactions \nwith locals or host country nationals, relating to cultural differences and norms; and (iii) work adjustment, \nwhich relates directly to the work role (see Black, 1988).  Although these distinctions are not without \ntheir critics (see Thomas & Lazarova, 2006), they do provide a frame within which to consider the \nchallenges faced by international assignees and how they can be supported while on assignment. \nHaslberger and Brewster (2009) recommend that company support for expatriates should resemble that \nfor circus acrobats on a high wire act. Assignees should be helped to develop the skills to adjust and \nperform in the new context.  Corporate support should be distanced enough to let the individual get on \nwith the job but be a safety net if needed.  \nOn balance, organizations with a history of international working tend to be better at providing \nsupport than those without. However, smaller organizations that suddenly have a need to send their \nemployees on an assignment can do a very good job through providing a personalized and tailored \napproach, owing to the small numbers involved. Therefore, the type of organization and its experience of \ninternational working are just two of the variables that determine practice. Another is the type of \nassignment, for example, disaster relief work for a Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) is quite \ndifferent from a large construction project or a country manager role. Specifically, organizations that \nregularly send people to provide disaster relief have to provide excellent support as the assignments can \nbe very demanding, traumatic and even dangerous.  In addition, the first stages frequently have to be \ncollapsed into less than 24 hours, regular support can be hard to provide, and the length of the \nassignment is often not known at the outset.   \nIdeally a programme of support would be tailored specifically to these kinds of situations, with \nspecial attention given to trauma and stress support during and after.  In many cases, immediate de-\nbriefing on return needs to include specialist counseling or even therapy if the individual has been \nexposed to particularly difficult experiences.  Here there are some similarities with tours of military \nservice where de-briefing, decompression and rest and recuperation are fundamental parts of the \ndeployment process. However, there is a paradox in which a \u2018core\u2019 group of those who regularly respond \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n14 \n \nto disasters  get to a point where they \u2018need\u2019 the adrenalin from the danger that is inherent in these kinds \nof IA, almost like a drug, so much so that they are restless and do not settle when back at base.   \nAs noted above, modes of employment such as expatriation can put pressure on family life.  \nInsights from contexts outside the corporate business setting such as seafarers and the military \n(Thomas & Bailey, 2009; Malcolmson et al, 2007) reinforce the fundamental impact of the family context \non the individual, their commitment, focus and ability to perform, and suggest support mechanisms to \nmitigate the potential negative impacts. The family can encounter significant difficulties in adapting to the \nforeign location (Haslberger, 2005) which has often been quoted as a major reason for expatriate failure \n(Tung, 1982; Mendenhall & Oddou, 1985), \u2018premature return\u2019, \u2018high costs\u2019 (Black et al, 1999) and \u2018poor \nadjustment\u2019 (Black et al, 1992) generally hampering the success of an expatriation event. Such work-\nfamily balance issues have been found to underpin intention to withdraw from the assignment or \norganization (Shaffer et al, 2001). As Haslberger (2005) succinctly points out, every individual \nexperiences the adjustment to expatriation in their own way. This requires organizational support that is \nflexible and which goes beyond standard provision to include more extensive training, mentoring and \nbuddy systems both on location and at home base. Support for partners he suggests, should include job \nplacement assistance, employee assistance programs, and the encouragement at the host location of a \ndeeper understanding of the adjustment process.  \nA further key contextual factor is the location of the assignment. As noted earlier, the cultural \ndistance between the assignee\u2019s home country and the host impact significantly on the nature of the \npre-departure training required. It will also impact significantly on the assignee and their family\u2019s \nexperience while on assignment and the nature of support required. Indeed, recent practitioner reports \nhave identified China, India and Russia as the most challenging destinations for expatriates (98 per cent \nof respondents in the study were from the Americas, Europe, Middle East and Africa) (Brookfield GMAC, \n2010).  The challenge of operating in a host context that is substantially culturally distinct is an issue \namplified by the fact that China is identified as the top emerging destination of international assignees, \nwhile India is fourth in the same survey.  \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n15 \n \nThe importance of non-work or off-the-job support is also significant. Specifically, the organization \ncan provide logistical support to assignees in relation to housing, transportation, and education for \nchildren. Such support helps to reduce the uncertainties surrounding general non-work adjustment \n(Black et al, 1991). Takeuchi, Wang, Marinova and Yao (2009) also identify home leaves, where \nexpatriates can visit their home country on a regular basis to keep in touch with relatives and friends as \nan important off the job support which assists assignees while on assignment. Empirically, these off-the-\njob supports were found to be significantly related to general adjustment (Takeuchi et al, 2009: 631). \nIndeed, Takeuchi et al (2009) call for greater attention to supporting expatriates off the job, arguing that \nincreasing investment in supporting expatriates may increase the return on investment for organizations.  \nSimilarly, at ETH Zurich it was observed that social integration should not be neglected and \nshould, at least initially, be fostered by the employer. Global recruitment means encouraging families to \nleave their home countries and to become migrants in a foreign environment. Even if the international \nhires in the corporate and academic worlds are generally highly privileged, they still become foreigners \nin a country and face potential discrimination and problems. Thus the organization places significant \nemphasis on introducing international hires to local networks to ease their interaction in the local \ncommunity. For example at ETH Zurich the dual career advisor facilitates the interaction of parents with \nlocal schools and other authorities. Additionally advisors help families to explore local sports or musical \nfacilities, act as community interpreters and accompany and introduce family members to people and \nevents.  \nWe also note the importance of the role context. For example, the nature of the assignment may \nfundamentally impact on the type of support required by the assignee. Shay and Baack (2004) applied \nNicholson\u2019s (1984) work role transition theory to develop a causal model of relationships among MNCs\u2019 \nreasons for assignment, modes of adjustment and measures of managerial effectiveness (self and \nsubordinate reported). This research indicated that the reason for the assignment influences expatriate \nmodes of adjustment, which, in turn, influence both the expatriate\u2019s self-reports of performance and \nsubordinate ratings of managerial effectiveness. Also type of assignment has a significant influence on \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n16 \n \nthe extent to which expatriate managers engage in both personal change and role innovation behaviors. \nThis work highlights the complex interaction between expatriate personal change, the antecedents to \nexpatriate modes of adjustment and outcome data relating to performance ratings both by the \nexpatriates themselves and by those who work for them on assignment.  \nThe degree to which an employee believes their organization values their contributions and cares \nabout their well-being (perceived organizational support, Eisenberger et al, 1986), and provides \norganizational support for career development more generally have been empirically linked to \ninternational assignees\u2019 commitment to their employing organization (Feldman & Thomas, 1992; \nKraimer et al, 2001; Kraimer & Wayne, 2004; Lazarova & Caliguiri, 2001). This, in turn, is likely to impact \non the IA\u2019s vision of a future career and intention to remain within the organization (Doherty & Dickmann, \n2009; Lazarova & Cerdin, 2007).  At Royal Mail, this is facilitated through regular updates in both \ndirections to review career opportunities and check career orientation prior to repatriation (see table 1). \nA further issue which can emerge for international assignees is a feeling that whilst on assignment, they \nmay have weakened their links with their home country. While, IAs offers great potential to expand \nglobal contacts and develop social capital (Makela, 2007), one of the key challenges which international \nassignees report while on assignment is the \u201cout of sight- out of mind\u201d syndrome and there is a \nsignificant risk of the individual losing touch with important networks within headquarters while on \nassignment (Dickmann & Doherty, 2008; Makela, 2007). This impact can be exacerbated where an \ninternational assignee is seconded to a less visible subsidiary, and risks being distanced from the core \nof the organization, reducing their knowing-whom career capital and promotion prospects. It appears \nthat this effect is further amplified for those assignees who undertake multiple assignments, where those \nwith between two and four assignments experience the poorest career advancement prospects (Kraimer \net al, 2009).  \nThe empirical literature points to the link between an individual\u2019s ability to maintain and develop \nconnections with the home country and their career success (Seibert et al, 2001). In this regard the role \nof a home country mentor appears particularly significant (Feldman & Thomas, 1992).  While on \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n17 \n \nassignment the home country mentor can provide a key link-pin for the assignee and their relationship \nmay help to reduce the assignee\u2019s sense of isolation, while keeping them in the loop on developments in \nthe home country and potential opportunities which may arise there (Carraher et al, 2008). These home \ncountry mentors can also play an important role in socially supporting the expatriate. This psychosocial \nsupport may help assignees in coping with the stress they face while on assignment (Baugh, Lankau & \nScandura, 1996). Such mentoring relationships may develop informally and indeed informal \nrelationships tend to enjoy higher levels of trust and focus to a greater degree on psychosocial functions \nas opposed to the short-term and often goal focused nature of more formal mentoring relations (Mezias \n& Scandura, 2005).  \nDistance can sometimes make it difficult to provide consistent career support for international \nassignees; however technology has now made a lot of things much easier.  For example, a series of \ncareer coaching sessions was held by Skype from the UK with an aid program co-coordinator in Kabul, \nAfghanistan. It would not otherwise have been easy, practicable or cost-effective to provide face to face \nsupport for a one or two hour session, especially for an NGO with limited resources.  The individual, in \nan unstable war situation, was very near the end of the contract so his need for coaching support was \ncrucial at this stage, so that he could make the right decisions for him and his family.  \nHost country personnel can also provide a key support to the international assignee while on \nassignment. Such local personnel can provide social support and information, and indeed the role of \nhost country nationals (HCNs), or local employees, in this regard has been compared to co-workers in \nthe domestic context who play an important role in the socialization of new employees to organizations \n(Carraher et al, 2008). Local mentors, both formal and informal, can greatly assist the international \nassignee in getting up to speed with local work practices and cultural norms therefore facilitating \nimproved performance (Carraher et al, 2008). Furthermore, higher leader-member-exchange (LMX) \nrelationships with the host supervisor, (this signifies the employee\u2019s perception of the quality of their \nrelationship with their supervisor) have been linked with increased levels of expatriate adjustment and \nintention to complete the assignment (Benson & Pattie, 2009). This indicates the important role of \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n18 \n \nsupport provided by the local supervisor.  However, for an international assignee this role is not \nrestricted to the workplace. HCNs can also assist the international assignee and their family in \nidentifying day-to-day necessities such as supermarkets, dry cleaners, restaurants and other key \nservices and indeed in understanding country-specific norms and behavioral heuristics (Mezias & \nScandura, 2005).  \n \nRealizing the Benefits of an International Assignment \nWhile repatriation has been positioned within the global assignment cycle as the end or final stage \nof expatriation, Doherty et al (2008) have suggested that reframing the repatriation element as more of a \nmid-point in the cycle may help address some of the issues which impact on readjustment and \nreintegration, including the development and use of acquired career capital, the alignment of \nexpectations and career outcomes. When positioned as the middle and not the end of the expatriation \nepisode the need for ongoing support through the repatriation element then extends to a much longer \ntemporal horizon and as suggested in Table 1 career support can continue for anything from 2-5 years \nafter return.  \nExtended support is needed due to the nature of the repatriation event. In addition to the \nchallenges an individual may face in a domestic transition, repatriate transitions are associated with \nchallenges of greater amplitude. The transitions tend to pose novel issues where individuals are \nreturning to a much changed situation both at work and socially. Since repatriation is generally at the \ninstigation of the organization rather than the individual, the experience is considered a difficult transition \nfor individuals to make (Feldman, 1991). Repatriates have been found to be most dissatisfied with the \nrepatriation element of an international assignment and specifically with respect to their careers. Many \nrepatriates view the experience as a \u201ccareer disaster\u201d (Baruch & Altman, 2002) on repatriation owing to \ntheir dissatisfaction and frustration with the under-utilization of their acquired skills (Lazarova & Cerdin, \n2007) or the career hiatus or \u201cwobble\u201d which can occur (Doherty & Dickmann, 2007).  \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n19 \n \nSignificantly, the difficulties of repatriation are often underestimated by organizations. Repatriation \ntends to be viewed as easy since the individual is returning \u2018home\u2019. However, the repatriation experience \nis quite a challenging one for the assignee and their family. Harvey and Novicevic (2006) classify the \nchallenges of repatriation into three categories. Work issues revolve around the \u2018holding pattern\u2019 in \nwhich repatriates often find themselves when there is no specific role for them on their return combined \nwith the reduced role autonomy which they face compared with whilst on assignment. Repatriates often \nreport frustration with the lack of opportunity to utilize the international experience gained while on \nassignment on their return (Lazarova & Cerdin, 2007). Second, individual and family issues relate to the \npotential reduction in living standards which repatriates face when the allowances they were \naccustomed to on assignment are lost.  The consequent reverse culture shock is a real issue in the \ntransition. The spouse may also face difficulties in getting back into the labor market on returning. \nFinally, a number of social and cultural issues emerge which make the transition a challenging one (for a \nfuller discussion of these issues, see Doherty et al., 2008; Harvey & Novicevic, 2006).  \nFrom a work perspective, repatriates who are not promoted on return tend to view themselves as \nunderemployed and thus overqualified for their role. They are more likely to seek a new job where they \ncan utilize their skills effectively (Kraimer at al, 2009; Stroh et al, 1998). Indeed, this may be a significant \nfactor in the high levels of turnover of employees on repatriation described by Lazarova and Cerdin \n(2007) in the \u2018frustrated expatriate\u2019 thesis. There is empirical support for the idea that repatriation \nsupport provided by the organization, emphasis on international experience gained when repatriated \nand the use of career planning all contribute to the retention of repatriates (e.g. Lazarova & Cerdin, \n2007). In addition, Stahl and colleagues (2009) found significant differences relating to turnover \nintentions on repatriation when comparing developmental assignees (learning driven) and functional \nassignees (demand-driven). It is suggested that, somewhat paradoxically, developmental assignees are \nmore inclined to leave their organization (measured by turnover intentions) arguing this is related to \nbetter career opportunities available to them in the external labor market (Dickmann & Doherty, 2010).  \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n20 \n \nAlternatively there is a view in the academic literature that for many expatriates the experience is \npremised on gaining international experience with little or no intention of remaining with the organization \non repatriation (Lazarova & Cerdin, 2007). The notion of the \u2018proactive repatriate\u2019 suggests that the \nindividual recognizes the value of their international experience in the external environment and that \nindividual initiative and career goals take precedence over organization objectives. Many repatriates \n\u201chave a career agenda of their own, which may or may not involve the organization that repatriated \nthem\u201d (Lazarova & Cerdin, 2007: 417). These individuals do not limit their career ambitions to the \nboundaries of their employing organization and are prepared to market their improved career capital in \nthe external labor market, where such experience carries a premium. Much of the extant literature on \nexpatriate careers tends to focus on the experience of the repatriate in a relatively short window after \nreturning as repatriation is often considered from an organizational perspective where retention and use \nof acquired skills and knowledge are the organizational pay-offs (Doherty et al., 2008). This literature \nrarely considers the careers of those repatriates who chose to change employers and fails to track \ncareer developments over an appropriate timeframe.  \nPositive career expectations as a consequence of an international assignment are common \namong repatriates and for many the international assignment experience is one of great personal value \neven when they leave the sending organization. Therefore, the experience is of career benefit to \nrepatriates extending beyond their employing organization.  The longer term impact of an IA will always \nbe understood well by individuals, for whom it may have been pivotal in their career development track. \nHowever, it can be difficult for them to reflect the value of the international assignment in their CV \n(resume) or subsequent job applications, particularly as developmental benefits accrued from an \nassignment are often less tangible and harder to articulate than other skills or experiences. This then \nmakes it more difficult for individuals to convince employers of the value of the earlier IA experience. \nWhen these individuals apply for jobs in the future, organizations tend to focus on much more recent \nand tangible skills and experience when making appointment decisions.  \n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n21 \n \nConclusions \nInternational assignees represent an important cohort of global migrants who enjoy a relatively \nprivileged position in the labor market compared to the other forms of migrants considered in this special \nsymposium. The enduring requirement for capable, able and willing individuals to engage in mobile \nbehavior is both a challenge and an opportunity.  In this paper we offer what we hope are important \ninsights from the intersection of academic research and practical experience to shed light on how this \ngroup can be supported in their IA, with a particular focus on the career implications of such moves.  We \ndraw attention to empirical evidence and practice that illustrates how supporting individuals who are \nundertaking an IA can help achieve both positive organizational outcomes and a smoother more \nconstructive journey for the individual. Our stance contrasts with much of the extant research and \npractice in the area which has been framed around the global assignment cycle. While the basic \nsegmentation of the IA event provides a useful starting point we advocate that the temporal frame in \nterms of career development needs to extend well beyond the assignment since many of the career \nbenefits materialize not just in the short term but also in the long term. This reinforces the need to \nprovide relevant career support throughout the IA episode and critically, at appropriate temporal points.  \nSpecifically, we highlight the key transition points which underscore perceptions of high uncertainty \nand risk for international assignees, particularly with respect to their career outcomes. The approach \nadvocated in the current paper highlights the fact that many of the challenges from an individual \nperspective are continuous, and pertinent well before the assignment and beyond repatriation. We also \nbuild on recent calls (Nicholson, 2007) for careers theory to devote more attention to the micro level of \nanalysis of cognition and motivation which are paramount to the IA experience. We point to the \nimportance of realistically framing the psychological contract at the assignment offer stage. Furthermore, \nwe highlight the importance of career counseling to help the individual consider the trade-offs between \nthe risk and career success in the context of their life choices before, during and, after the international \nassignment (Nicholson, 2007). The important influence of spouse and family is also highlighted, with \ndual career issues emphasized. In this regard, the levels of support provided to spouse and family are \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n22 \n \nfundamental in framing the decision to undertake the assignment and the transition while on \nassignment. \nOnce the decision is made to undertake an assignment, providing assignees with the \u201csofter\u201d \ninterpersonal and cross-cultural skills required during the international assignment emerge as essential.  \nSupport in developing these skills is particularly important given the fact that technical competence \ntends to dominate selection decisions, notwithstanding the significance of the softer skills in facilitating \nadjustment and performance while on assignment (Harris & Brewster, 1999). Specifically, we argue that \nsupport should be adapted to account for the nature of the assignment undertaken, providing \nappropriate help based on whether the purpose of the assignment is demand or learning driven. We \npoint to the importance of preparation beginning well in advance of the assignment (up to six months in \nadvance).  \nBuilding on the idea that the transitions associated with IA are often continuous, it may be \nimpossible to adequately prepare assignees for all situations they may encounter while on assignment. \nThus, continuing support, with a degree of flexibility to ensure it is tailored to meet the individual \nassignee and their family\u2019s need is recommended (Haslberger, 2005). Insights from ETH Zurich provide \na clear practical example of where the importance of social integration is recognized and efforts are \nmade to maximize this. Support should also be provided in terms of off-the-job needs, such as home \nleaves, which can facilitate general adjustment (Takeuchi et al, 2009). \nIn general, the extent to which employees feel that the organization values their contribution, cares \nabout their wellbeing and supports their career development is positively associated with their \ncommitment to the organization (Feldman & Thomas, 1992; Kraimer et al, 2001; Lazarova & Caliguiri, \n2001). The importance of maintaining links to the home country through mentoring is highlighted. \nOngoing mentoring can provide support to assignees in preparing for the transition to the host country \nas well as throughout the experience. \nPositioning repatriation as more of a mid-point in the cycle (Doherty et al, 2008) highlights the \nongoing need for career support. Specifically, repatriation brings many challenges for individuals and \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n23 \n \ntheir families and a failure to address these challenges leads to high levels of frustration and turnover of \nrepatriates. Our review highlights the use of career planning in facilitating repatriate retention (Lazarova \n& Cerdin, 2007; Stroh, 1995) and hence helping to secure the organizational value of international \nexperience as well as helping the individual to reap the benefit of the experience.  A key challenge for \nresearch in the area is to effectively chart the career implications of international assignments of both \nthose who remain within organizations and those who leave for other roles.  \nOverall, we suggest that support should not be a overly standardized and should be adapted to \naccount for inter alia, the individual and family needs, the host location and, the nature of the role \n(demand v learning driven). Furthermore, it should begin well in advance of the assignment and \ncontinue long after repatriation. Support should be as integrated as possible to ensure that individuals \nare equipped to face the transitions they experience.  \n \nAvenues for Future Research \nIn plotting a future research agenda for supporting expatriate careers we concur with Arnold and \nCohen\u2019s (2008) recent assertion that careers research in general would benefit from imaginative \noutcome variables, more sophisticated methods, more attention to context and tighter conceptual clarity. \nFrom a careers perspective we argue that career success needs to be measured over a far longer time \nframe and include the distinction between objective and subjective career success. Transition theory \nadvocates the adoption of longitudinal designs that facilitate tracking of personal change through \nrepeated measures. These may include self-reported personal change before, during and after the \nexperience of transition, to facilitate the tracking of modes of adjustment, which Nicholson suggests may \nshift over the long term as a result of experience. This approach can provide alternative perspectives on \nwork, careers and life-span development which are particularly pertinent to the transitions experienced \nby international assignees. Such research has important implications for the type of support which would \nbest facilitate performance while on assignment, and subsequent career progression. In addition, given \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n24 \n \nthe substantial impact of the spouse on the IA episode, one area for future focus is that of the career \nimplications for the trailing partner and the impact this has on the assignee.  \nFinally, we recognize the importance of context and conceptual clarity. We have illustrated that the \nnature of the assignment (demand versus learning driven) merits greater consideration as a contextual \nissue. Further study could usefully explore the recent trends in globalization which have led to an \nincrease in the variability of working patterns where employees now engage in a range of alternative \nforms of international working such as short-term assignments, international business travel, virtual \nassignments etc. (Collings et al, 2007; Harvey et al, 2001). The majority of what we know about \nsupporting assignees derives from the study of parent country nationals seconded to foreign \nsubsidiaries (Collings et al, 2010). Empirically we know far less about the nature of inpatriate \nassignments (employees from subsidiaries transferred to the headquarters) and third country nationals \n(TCNs) (employees from one country working for a multinational headquartered in another country and \ntransferred to a third country). Future study could explore the nature of support required in these \ndiffering conditions. \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n25 \n \n \nReferences \n \nArnold, J. and Cohen, L.
