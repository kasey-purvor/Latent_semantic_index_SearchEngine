But\nhow our Association began relates to a basic issue which I wish to address in this\nEditorial.\nALT began with a meeting of three people. Graham Chesters and I went to see Jonathan\nDarby to ask if he wanted to be involved in launching a new journal in the area of CAL.\nThe idea of an association grew out of our discussions (as I remember, Jonathan Darby\nthought of the name). The three of us could see that, beyond the CTI centres, learning\ntechnology was creating a loose network of interested parties within higher education,\nand we decided that this network would benefit from a formal structure which an\nassociation could provide. Shortly afterwards, at our first meeting proper of the newly\nformed Executive Committee, it was evident that all involved were generally optimistic\nabout the use of computer-based learning technology within higher education. On the\nother hand, we were also very conscious of the resistance to learning technology already\nbeing encountered in many higher-education institutions, partly for reasons related to\ntechnophobia and fear of job losses, more so because of some poorly designed CAL\nproducts that did not fit learners' requirements and\/or expectations (not to mention the\nexpectations of university managers).\nAll the papers and many of the reviews in this issue of ALT-J are concerned with this\nmatter to some extent, and two papers directly so. King and Honeybone ask if CAL can\nbe 'the 5th Cavalry charging to the rescue of the beleaguered educational troops'; not,\nthey say, unless student needs are understood and the very purpose of university\neducation clearly defined and accepted. Hopkins and Colombi are convinced that at the\ncentre of the debate lie issues 'concerned with the ability of CAL to offer and deliver a\nteaching and learning experience which is as effective as more established modes'.\n2\nALT-J Volume 4 Number 2\nMost higher-education institutions nowadays are either (at least in certain departments)\ncommitted to or looking seriously at the use of CAL, for one or more of four reasons.\nThe first is that staff-student ratios have risen. The second is that modularization has\nbrought increased pressure. The third is that it finally seems that the technology can (just\nabout) meet user-expectations. The fourth is that not being able to boast the wide use of\nCAL carries with it the risk of appearing old-hat. But the fact that Orsini-Jones and\nJones, again in this issue of ALT-J, can talk of 'the recent backlash against information\ntechnology which is becoming increasingly fashionable' in itself indicates that some of the\nfundamental problems of promoting CAL, of which that original ALT Executive\nCommittee was only too aware, have still not been resolved.\nHas ALT, in four years, achieved anything beyond what we hope are excellent\ninformation services, useful workshops, exciting conferences, valuable briefing sessions,\nand so forth? If these are truly achievements, they are not to be belittled. But on the\nquestion itself, I claim not the 5th Cavalry but the 5th Amendment. What I will say is that\nI believe in the effectiveness of good CAL, but that we continue to climb a steep rock-face\nas its advocates, and that we remain in mortal peril of crashing to the ground unless we\nface up squarely to the doubts about CAL deeply embedded in many university teachers\n(even some of those involved in it). It is not that ALT has failed to play its part in\nconvincing higher-education institutions to go down the technological route - on the\ncontrary. It is that not delivering quality and well-targeted goods, and thereby fuelling\ndoubts and alienating decision-makers, may have disastrous consequences.\nGabriel Jacobs\n3\n"}
