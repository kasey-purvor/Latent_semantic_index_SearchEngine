Introduction\nWhile pesticides are used extensively within modern agricultural techniques to control\ninsect infestation, increasing concern is being shown towards their indiscriminate use\nand the long-term effects they may cause to the environment, livestock and human\nhealth [1,2]. A significant proportion of the pesticides used within agriculture become\nwashed off or are otherwise lost from the large areas of agricultural land treated\nsurfaces - and for this reason an excess of active ingredient is commonly applied [3].\nThe problem is compounded by the fact that many pesticides such as DDT have very\nlong lifetimes under environmental conditions. Although organophosphate pesticides\n(OPs) are now commonly used instead of the organochlorine pesticides due to their\nlower persistence in the environment whilst still remaining effective, they are,\nhowever, neurotoxins and therefore present a serious risk to human health. These\ncompounds may still find their way into our food and water supplies, which\nnecessitates the use of analytical approaches for the reliable detection of pesticides for\nenvironmental protection and food safety purposes. Legislation has now been passed\nto help restrict pesticides within water supplies; European Commission: EU Water\nFramework Directive 2000\/60\/EC, European Commission: Drinking Water Directive\n98\/83\/EC, which recommends levels within water supplies of 0.1 mg\/l for individual\npesticides and 0.5 mg\/l for total pesticide. It is likely that with the widespread\nconcerns about these materials that these levels could come down. More recently, the\narea of biodefense is receiving much attention, with organophosphate based nerve\nagents also needing to be analysed.\nContemporary methods for environmental determination and\/or the monitoring of\npesticides include gas and liquid chromatography and various spectroscopic\n4techniques [4]. Each of these approaches suffers from several disadvantages such as\nbeing costly, time consuming, not sufficiently sensitive and\/or requiring complex\nsample preparation [1,5,6]. Continuous monitoring moreover, is not possible with any\nof these methods and it follows that a simplified analytical approach would prove\nhighly beneficial.\nA potential solution to this problem is the utilisation of biosensor technology.\nBiosensors generically offer simplified reagentless analyses for a range of biomedical\nand industrial applications and for this reason thie area has continued to develop into\nan ever expanding and multidisciplinary field during the last couple of decades.\nElectrochemical techniques are amongst the easiest and most inexpensive methods for\ndetection of binding events and many groups have previously demonstrated the\nfabrication of enzymatic and affinity based sensors that lend themselves to\ninterrogation by either (i.) amperometric or (ii.) impedimetric approaches.\nMuch of the work described was carried out within a collaborative project between a\nnumber of academic and industrial groups under the remit of the SAFEGARD\nconsortium, an EU funded Framework 5 research contract ref QLRT-1999-30481.\nThe various expertises available from the academic and industrial collaborators made\nthis project feasible.\nThe detection of many pesticides at extremely low levels can be best achieved not by\ndirect detection of the pesticide itself but rather by detection of its inhibitory effects\non enzyme reactions. An enzyme-electrode is first constructed and its response when\nexposed to a suitable concentration of its substrate determined. When an electrode is\n5then exposed to a dilute pesticide solution, the pesticide interacts with the enzyme and\ndiminishes (or completely destroys) its activity. This inhibition can then be easily\nquantified by further exposure to the initial substrate concentration and comparison\nwith the response prior to pesticide exposure.\nThe detection of organophosphate and other pesticides based on the inhibition of the\nenzyme acetylcholinesterase by these compounds has received considerable attention\nprimarily due to high specificity and sensitivity [1,7-16]. Cholinesterases, such as\nacetylcholinesterase catalyse the hydrolysis of choline esters to the corresponding\ncarboxylic acid and choline; Eqn. 1.\nEqn. 1.\nacetylcholinesterase\nAcetylcholine + H2O ------------------------> choline + acetic acid\nThe use of electrochemical techniques combined with biological molecules has been\nextensively reviewed [17] and will not be discussed in detail here. The most widely\nused method for the AChE containing electrodes is via the simple amperometric\ndetection of the product of the ester hydrolysis enzyme catalysed reaction [17].\nA typical approach is to utilise a substrate which when hydrolysed by the enzyme\ngives rise to a product which can be easily detected electrochemically. Thiocholine\ncan be easily detected using screen-printed carbon electrodes doped with cobalt\nphthalocyanine (CoPC) [18,19], which acts as an electrocatalyst for the oxidation of\nthiocholine at a lowered working potential of approximately +100mV (versus\n6Ag\/AgCl) [18,19], thereby minimising interference from other electroactive\ncompounds; Eqn. 2.\nEqn. 2.\nacetylthiocholine chloride + H2O ----------> thiocholine(red) + acetic acid + Cl\u2212\n2 thiocholine(red) ---------> thiocholine(ox) + 2e\u2212 + 2H+ (at 100 mV vs. Ag\/AgCl)\nA similar approach utilises p-aminophenyl acetate [20].\nThere are problems with this approach since enzymes isolated from natural sources\nsuch as the electric organ of electric eels often display low sensitivity and selectivity\nto the wide range of potential pesticide targets [21]. A possible solution to this is the\ndevelopment of a multisensor array where a variety of genetically modified\nacetylcholinesterases are immobilised on an array of electrochemical sensors and the\nresponses from these are then processed via a neural network.\nA wide variety of methods exist for the immobilisation of enzymes on a sensor\nsurface. Screen-printed carbon electrodes are often the favourite base for these sensors\ndue to their inexpensiveness and ease of mass-production. Methods used for the\nconstruction of AChE containing electrodes include: simple adsorption from solution\n[22], entrapment within a photo-crosslinkable polymer [20,24], adsorption from\nsolution onto microporous carbon and incorporation into a hydroxyethyl cellulose\nmembrane [25], binding to a carbon electrode via Concanavalin A affinity [26,27] and\nentrapment within conducting electrodeposited polymers [28].\n72. Application\n2.1 Synthesis of the acetylcholinesterase.\nEarlier work in this field [29] indicated that acetylcholinesterase enzymes would be\nsuitable biomolecules for the purpose of pesticide detection, however, it was found\nthat the sensitivity of the method varied with the type and source of cholinesterase\nused. Therefore the initial thrust of this work was the development of a range of\nenzymes via selective mutations of the Drosophila melanogaster acetylcholinesterase\n(Dm. AChe). For example mutations of the (Dm. AChe) were made by site-directed\nmutagenesis expressed within baculovirus [30]. The acetylcholinesterases were then\npurified by affinity chromatography [31]. Different strategies were used to obtain\nthese mutants, namely: (i.) substitution of amino acids at positions found mutated in\nAChE from insects resistant to insecticide, (ii.) mutations of amino acids at positions\nsuggested by 3-D structural analysis of the active site, (iii.) Ala-scan analysis of\namino acids lining the active site gorge, (iv.) mutagenesis at positions detected as\nimportant for sensitivity in the Ala-scan analysis, and (v.) combination of mutations\nwhich independently enhance sensitivity. The activity of the enzymes was determined\nphotometrically at 412 nm using the Ellman method [32]. The use of these different\nstrategies allowed the development of sensitive enzymes, for a mutant which was 300-\nfold more sensitive to dichlorvos than the Drosophila wild-type enzyme - and\n288,000-fold more sensitive than the electric eel enzyme which is commonly used to\ndetect organophosphates. The most effective method of increasing the sensitivity to\nthe pesticide appeared to be via the incorporation of hydrophobic amino acids at the\nrim of the active site of the enzyme [25,33]. For example, in solution the sensitivity to\nmethamidophos of a genetically modified Drosophila AChE was one order of\nmagnitude higher than a commercial electric eel AChE [33]. When immobilised in a\n8biosensor, this led to a useful working analytical range for the Drosophila AChE\nelectrode of 0.5-100 ppb methamidophos as against 0.05-24 ppm for the commercial\nAChE electrode.\n2.2 Immobilisation of the enzymes.\nSeveral different approaches have been developed within the group of the\nSAFEGARD consortium to immobilise the engineered AChEs. The simplest of these\nwas reported by Bonnet et al [22] in which a screen-printed graphite electrode was\nexposed to a solution of commercial electric eel AChE in phosphate buffer. The\nresultant enzyme electrodes were then used to detect acetylthiocholine chloride (10-3\nM) which gave currents in the range of 225 nA. Inhibition studies with chlorpyrifos\nethyl oxon (exposure time 10 min) were performed and gave a detection limit of 1.2\nng l-1 with good operational stability. The absence of diffusion barriers, however, gave\na high level of sensitivity, although there was high variability in response between\nelectrodes. In the work of Andreescu et al [23], a comparative study where the\nenzyme was immobilised using the following techniques was made. This included;\n(a) A mixing of AChE with graphite, tetracyanoquinodimethanide (TCNQ, used\nas a mediator), hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC) and a methyltrimethoxysilane\nbased sol-gel which was then deposited on a screen-printed working electrode\nsurface as a paste. This was then allowed to dry.\n(b) Screen-printing a graphite\/TCNQ\/HEC composite electrode, then printing a\nlayer consisting of the enzyme and a 30% solution of a photopolymerisable\npoly(vinyl alcohol)\/styryl pyridinium copolymer on top of the electrode and\nfinally irradiation with UV light to photocrosslink the polymer.\n9(c) Screen-printing a graphite\/TCNQ\/HEC composite electrode and then printing\na layer containing a nickel compound attached to a silica support. This was\nthen exposed to a solution of a histidine6-tagged AChE in phosphate buffer,\nwith the histidine tag binding strongly to the immobilised nickel compound.\nThe three types of electrode were exposed to solutions of acetylthiocholine chloride\nand the resulting current recorded. These gave slightly different calibration curves\nover the concentration range 0-2.5 x 10-3 M of substrate, with the nickel containing\ncomposite being the least sensitive. The nickel composite also gave the poorest\nstorage performance, with the other two electrodes being stable up to 12 days, and the\npoorest reproducibility also being observed for the nickel binding method.\nInhibition studies were made with chlorpyrifos ethyl oxon with the sol-gel method\ngiving the largest linear range (0- 6 x 10-8 M), although the nickel-binding method\ngave an electrode which was more sensitive at lower concentrations. The sol-gel\nelectrode also gave good response behaviour to paraoxon and dichlorvos.\nFurther work [34] also compared enzyme electrodes formulated using the\nphotocrosslinking technique above - with the electrodes being treated by simple\nimmobilisation of AChE inside a matrix of bovine albumin crosslinked by\nglutaraldehyde. A variety of experimental conditions were utilised. The\nglutaraldehyde crosslinking technique has the advantage of simplicity and gives\nelectrodes which have fast response times while being robust and reproducible. They\ndid require a far higher enzyme content (80 mUA), however, to give similar responses\n10\nto those of the photopolymerised electrodes containing 0.7-1.0 mUA of enzyme. It\nshould also not be forgotten that this greatly increases the expense of such systems.\nMicroporous carbon was also studied as a potential substrate for binding of AChE\n[25,35]. Discs cut from a commercial porous carbon rod were cleaned and then\nexposed to a solution of AChE in phosphate buffer for 20 hours to allow for simple\nphysisorption and chemisorption of the enzyme. Initial tests using electric eel AChE\n[35] gave linear detection of dichlorvos in the range 10-6-10-12 M. The sensitivity of\nthis method was increased still further by utilisation of the genetically engineered\nAChE mentioned earlier, with the detection limit of these systems being extended\ndown to 10-17 M [35].\nInstability of the mutant AChE can be a problem with up to 50% of its activity in\nsolution being lost in 10 days. This led to a study in which the enzyme was\nimmobilised in porous silica (pore size 10 nm) or porous carbon (<70 nm) beads [36].\nThe AChE is known to be approximately 6 nm in size and therefore it is thought that\nentrapment within the pores could well inhibit unfolding of the enzyme, so enhancing\nits stability.\nFollowing immobilisation, the beads were dispersed in a aqueous solution of HEC\nand cast onto Pt electrodes. Activity tests showed that leaching of immobilised\nenzyme was 2.5 times slower than that of free enzyme dispersed in HEC.\nComparisons of activity to acetylthiocholine after 72h constant operation showed a\nlarge stability enhancement for enzymes immobilised on both silica and carbon when\ncompared to dispersion in HEC [36].\n11\nAffinity binding was also used to bind AChE to a working electrode surface [26].\nAmino-grafted silica beads were used as the starting point and reacted with\nglutaraldhyde. The resultant beads containing active aldehyde groups on the surface\nwere then treated with Concanavalin A, a lectin type protein with binding affinity for\nmannose, a sugar which is present at the surface of AChE. Finally the protein-grafted\nsilica beads were treated with a solution of commercial electric eel AChE [26].\nTreatment with divinyl sulfone followed by a disaccharide was used as alternative\nactivating step before Concanavalin A adsorption. Monitoring of enzymatic activity\nshowed binding of the AChE only for systems containing sugar\/Concanavalin A\naffinity links, indicating that unspecific adsorption did not lead to immobilisation of\nthe enzyme. The beads were then mixed with graphite\/TCNQ composite and cast onto\na screen-printed working electrode.\nAmperometric activity of the electrodes in thiocholine before and following exposure\nto solutions of pesticides was measured. Sample to sample reproducibility was found\nto be favourable (RSD 6.6%), as was stability with electrodes being shown to be\ncapable of being stored for up to two months at -18oC. Linear detection of\nchlorpyrifos methyl oxon by inhibition was obtained between 1 x 10-8-5 x 10-8 M by\nthis approach.\nA similar method was used [27] to directly immobilise AChE on the electrode. A\nscreen-printed carbon electrode was treated with a Nafion\/heptylamine mixture. The\namino groups were then activated with divinyl sulfone and then treated with a\ndisaccharide. This was then used to bind first Concanavalin A and then electric eel\nAChE via affinity binding. The resultant electrodes had similar reproducibility to the\n12\nsilica-containing analogues with no enzyme leakage occurring upon storage for 2\nhours in buffer. Bovine albumin was used in this instance to block non-specific\nbinding. The electrode activity was completely inhibited upon exposure to\nchlorpyrifos methyl oxon (10-5 M), but could be completely regenerated simply by\nexposing the electrode to fresh AChE solution; this behaviour was observed for three\ninhibition\/regeneration cycles.\n2.3 Use of microelectrodes.\nAnother potential method for immobilising AChE is to entrap the enzyme within a\nconducting polymer such as polyaniline. The entrapment of biological molecules\nwithin conducting polymers has been widely studied and extensively reviewed\nelsewhere [37]. All the methods described so far in this paper have been related to the\nproduction of planar electrodes. Microelectrodes offer several advantages over\nconventional larger working electrodes within biosensors, since they experience\nhemispherical solute diffusional profiles, and it is this phenomenon that can impart\nstir independence to sensor responses whilst also offering lowered limits of detection.\nIndividual microelectrodes offer very small responses and one approach for\novercoming this problem is to use many microelectrodes together in the form of an\narray to allow a cumulative and so larger response to be measured. Microelectrode\narrays may be fabricated by a number of approaches although techniques such as\nphotolithography or laser ablation have to date proved cost prohibitive for the mass\nproduction of disposable sensor strips. We have previously described a novel\nsonochemical fabrication approach [38, 39] for the production of microelectrodes, that\nlends itself to the mass production of sensor arrays.\n13\nThe method of producing microelectrodes will be described in more detail within the\nprotocol (protocol 25). The method is as shown schematically in Fig. 1. A conducting\nsurface, for example formed by screen printed-carbon can be insulated by deposition\nof poly(o-phenylene diamine). Sonochemical ablation has been shown to form pores\nin this insulating surface [39] with population densities of up to 2 x 105 pores cm-1.\nElectrochemical deposition of conducting polyaniline at these pores can be performed\nand used to grow protrusions of polyaniline at the surface [38] and if AChE is\nincluded in the deposition solution, the enzyme may be entrapped within a conducting\npolyaniline matrix [28]. These arrays of polyaniline protrusions can be visualised by\nscanning electron microscopy [40] (Fig. 2) and display the typical stir-independent\nbehaviour of microelectrodes [28].\nIn this way a sonochemically-fabricated microelectrode array was used to form an\narray of conducting microelectrodes [28] containing a genetically modified AChE\nwhich had been modified to maximise pesticide sensitivity. Use of a I125 labelled\nAChE meant that the amount of enzyme deposited could be measured and in this\ninstance corresponded to 0.15 units activity. Measuring the amperometric response of\nthe electrode in acetylthiocholine before and following exposure to paraoxon\nsolutions allowed a measurement of the inhibition of enzyme activity. Levels as low\nas 10-17 M paraoxon could be reproducibly detected [28]. Although very low, these\nlevels are comparable to those determined using acetylcholineesterase immobilised on\nmicroporous conductive carbon [25].\n2.4 Multiple pesticide detection.\n14\nOne major problem with determining pesticides in real samples is that one or several\nof a range of pesticides could be present. Therefore we need a sensor that can\ninterrogate the sample and determine not only which pesticides are present but at what\nlevels. One possible method is to manufacture a sensor, usually by screen-printing,\ncontaining multiple working electrodes with each containing a different AChE.\nPattern recognition software can then be used to monitor the varying inhibitory\nresponse pesticides and mixtures of pesticides. Alternatively a range of single AChE\nelectrodes can be manufactured and then incorporated into a flow injection system so\nthat they are all simultaneously exposed to the sample, with responses being\nmonitored and pattern recognition software used as before.\nA series of multielectrode sensors were developed based on Drosophila mutant AChE\nimmobilised via photocrosslinking onto screen-printed carbon electrodes [8]. Four\ndifferent mutant and wild type AChE were evaluated for their sensitivity to the\norganophosphate paraoxon and the carbamate pesticide carbofuran. The response of\nthe electrodes in thiocholine before and following a fifteen minute exposure to\nsolutions of the pesticides was compared. The data was then processed using a feed-\nforward neural network generated with NEMO 1.15.02 as previously described [8, 9].\nNetworks with the smallest errors were selected and further refined. This approach\ntogether with varying the AChE led to the construction of a sensor with capability to\nanalyse the binary pesticide mixtures.\nWhen solutions of individual pesticides were used, concentrations as low as 0.5 \uf06dg\/l\n(10-9M) could be determined. When binary mixtures with pesticide levels from 0-5\n\uf06dg\/l were measured, the concentration of each pesticide could be determined within\n15\nthe range with errors of 0.4 \uf06dg\/l for paraoxon and 0.5 \uf06dg\/l for carbofuran. Similar\nlevels were obtained when river water samples spiked with pesticide were used but\nwith a higher degree of inaccuracy. When different mutant AChE\u2019s were utilised,\nbinary mixtures of the very similar pesticides paraoxon and malaoxon could be\nanalysed in the range 0-5 \uf06dg\/l, with resolution of the two components with accuracies\nof the order of 1 \uf06dg\/l. The use of more sensitive and selective mutant enzymes\ntogether with the addition of extraction and concentration steps to the assay could\ngreatly enhance the methods range and accuracy.\nA flow injection system combined with an enzyme electrode was used to detect and\nquantify a variety of pesticides [41]. Photocrosslinkable poly(vinyl alcohol) was used\nto immobilise AChE onto platinum wire working electrodes. These were then placed\ninside a flow injection cell and the electrochemical response to injections of\nthiocholine measured. A series of measurements were made before and following the\ninjection of a pesticide solution. Under constant flow, the sensors were found to be\nstable for several days. The inhibition of the current after exposure to various\npesticide solutions was measured with detection limits using mutant AChEs being\nfound to be as low 1.1 \uf06dg\/l (Chlorpyrifos oxon), 30 \uf06dg\/l (paraoxon) and 25 \uf06dg\/l\n(malaoxon). What makes this system of interest is that it could potentially be used for\nmultiple tests with the sample electrode, since injection of and incubation of the\nelectrode with pyridine-2-aldoxime methochloride reversed the inhibition effect of the\npesticide. Detection of pesticides in spiked river water samples was also achieved.\nSome of the work described previously showed diminution of the biosensor\nperformance when pesticide solutions using river water rather than laboratory water\n16\nwere used. This is thought to be partially due to other compounds present within river\nwater affecting electrode performance. A system containing triple enzyme electrodes\nwithin a flow injection system was developed in an attempt to combat this [23]. Three\ndifferent AChE variants were immobilised on screen-printed electrodes by\nphotocrosslinking, one a wild type Drosophila, the second a mutant with extremely\nhigh sensitivity to pesticides and the third a wild type electric eel AChE which is\nrelatively resistant to pesticide. However any matrix interference would affect both\nelectrodes equally and therefore can be subtracted, allowing us to distinguish\ninhibition due to the presence of non-pesticide inhibitors, e.g. Hg from specific\ninteractions which occur only if pesticides are present. Limits of detection for the\npesticide omethoate were found to be 2 x 10-6 M for the wild type Drosophila and 10-7\nM for the mutant - levels which caused only minimal inhibition of the electric eel\nAChE control.\nHeavy metals and hypochlorite can both inhibit AChE [23] and so similar tests for\npesticides were repeated in solutions containing either 20 mg\/l Hg2+ or 0.1 mg\/l\nNaClO4. In both cases large inhibition effects were noted for both the enzyme\nelectrodes, not just the mutant, so indicating the presence of a non-specific interferent.\nWhen river water was introduced to the system, no inhibition effects were observed,\nhowever, when omethoate spiked river water samples were used, then inhibition\neffects could be measured for the mutant with similar levels of sensitivity to when\npure water was used as the matrix.\nAs an alternative to simple AChE electrodes, a bienzyme system containing AChE\nand tyrosinase which utilised phenyl acetate as a substrate has been developed [42].\n17\nThe AChE hydrolyses the phenyl acetate to phenol which the tyrosinase enzyme\noxidises to p-quinone which can in turn be detected electrochemically. The bienzyme\nsystem was found to be less sensitive than the AChE electrode, although it did display\na large tolerance for hexane.\nMicro-electrode arrays containing AChE were also utilised within a flow injection\nsystem [40]. A system was developed where a sample was separated and flushed\nsimultaneously through eight cells, each containing a screen-printed electrode and\nfitted with a separate bespoke mini-potentiostat (Fig 3). This allowed multiple\nmeasurements to be made on a single water sample using multiple electrodes, each\nspecific for a different pesticide due to inclusions of different AChE mutants in each\nof the electrodes. Pattern recognition software could then be utilised to deduce the\npesticide levels in a potentially complex sample.\nEarly results indicate a high sensitivity for pesticide detection, with the system being\ncapable of detecting dichlorvos at concentrations as low as 1 x 10-17 M and parathion\nand azinphos both at concentrations as low as 1 x 10-16 M [40].\n2.5 Signal processing for pesticide detection.\nThe development of user-friendly automated instrumentation able for identification\nand quantitative detection of pesticides is needed for a wide variety of application\nareas. For the identification and quantification of the pesticide type the multi sensor\napproach combined with pattern recognition software is highly promising. To enable\npesticide quantification, special algorithms for the signal processing of the biosensor\nresponse have been developed.\n18\nThese algorithms can be divided into two groups. The first group consists of\nalgorithms related to the signal processing of a separate sensor response on a pesticide\ninjection. They decrease the influence of noise on the measurements by increasing the\nsignal-to-noise ratio thereby providing a lowering of detection limit and increasing the\nsensitivity and reproducibility of the instrumentation.\nThe second group consists of algorithms associated with the pesticide concentration\nquantification. In this case, the initial data is the processed sensor response for an\nunknown pesticide concentration and the parameters of the calibration curve (which is\nderived from preliminary experimental calibration measurements for a range of\nstandard pesticide concentrations) or alternatively, a set of sensor responses obtained\nby addition of known amounts of pesticide to the analysed sample. This group of\nalgorithms allows the automation of the pesticide quantification, thereby enabling the\nuse of the instrumentation by unskilled personal. This removes the sensing platform\nfrom specialized laboratories to the realm of the end-users.\nThe structure of the algorithm for the developed software is presented in Fig.4. It\nintegrates biosensor signal processing together with pesticide quantification\nalgorithms and includes:\n\uf0b7 Preliminary biosensor signal processing\n\uf0b7 Analytical signal extraction, and,\n\uf0b7 Analytical signal processing.\n19\nPreliminary biosensor signal processing combines the analysis of the background\nsignal and biosensor response and smoothing\/filtration of the biosensor response upon\npesticide injection. Its purpose is to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the biosensor\nresponse resulting from pesticide injection by using an optimal smoothing\/filtration\nprocedures, the parameters of which are defined by the analysis of background signal\nand the biosensor response after pesticide injection in the time and frequency\ndomains. Application of this approach to the electric eel AChE electrode\ndemonstrated that the biosensor background signal in the time domain represents\nGaussian noise with non-zero medium. The correlation time was equal to 17.47 s\nwhich defined the lower limit of the integration time for noise filtration. In the\nfrequency domain the background signal presented mainly uniform distributed noise\nwith a small region below 8 mHz with flicker noise type of frequency dependence (1\/f\nfunction).\nAnalysis of biosensor response on the pesticide injections with different\nacteylthiocholine concentrations in the range of 1 \u2013 50 mM displayed a shape of\nnormalised sensor response that only slightly depended on the pesticide concentration.\nSignal time (the time interval containing 90% of signal energy), which gives the upper\nlimit of the integration time for the signal filtration, decreased only by 16% from 100s\nif the concentration increased by two orders of magnitude. In the frequency domain\nthe biosensor responses presented a bell-shaped profile where the frequency band of\nthe signal (the band containing 90% of the signal energy) slightly increased with\nincreasing pesticide concentration. The filter band equal to 5 mHz can be selected as a\nlower limit for the frequency filtration approach.\n20\nExamination of the different algorithms for filtration\/smoothing of the biosensor\nresponse, which included low frequency filtration, Gaussian kernel and running\nmedian smoothing, demonstrated that the running median smoothing method could be\nrecommended. This is due to its good adaptability to fast signal variations, which are\ntypical for the biosensor response on a pesticide injection.\nThe analytical signal extraction block is based on determination of the maximum\nsignal response and includes the following sections: selection of response extremes,\ndetermination of the extreme parameters, elimination of the weak extremes and\ncalculation of the analytical signal for pesticide quantification. The differences\nbetween the maxima in the biosensor response and baselines were used for the\ncalculation of analytical signals, where the line drawn between two nearby minima\nwithin the limits of each injection was taken to be the base line.\nThis analytical signal of the biosensor was used for:\n\uf0b7 calculation of the biosensor calibration parameters (slope and intercept of the\ncalibration line) by statistical processing of the biosensor responses following\npesticide injections with known concentrations, or,\n\uf0b7 pesticide quantification in the sample by means of calibration parameters or, in\ncase of need more accurate data, by means of the standard addition software\nanalogous to the algorithm described in [43]\n21\n3. Conclusions.\nThis chapter describes the wide range of research undertaken by several groups during\nthe course of the SAFEGARD European Commission funded Framework V project.\nA wide range of mutant acetylcholinesterase enzymes have been obtained with some\nbeing determined to have sensitivities to selected pesticides orders of magnitude\ngreater than wild type enzymes. A wide range of immobilisation techniques have been\nstudied to develop sensitive and selective enzyme electrodes which can measure\nconcentrations of a range of pesticides down to levels hitherto undetectable (1 x 10-17\nM).\nOther techniques such as use of multiple electrodes, pattern recognition software and\nflow injection techniques have enabled the subtraction of matrix effects such as heavy\nmetals from the system as well as the determination of pesticides in systems\ncontaining more than one compound. The signal processing algorithms allow\nautomation of the pesticide quantification enabling use of the instrumentation by\nunskilled personal, thereby removing this sensing platform from specialized\nlaboratories and making it available to the end-users. Thus this application could\nconceivably be utilised in the field as well as under laboratory conditions. The relative\nlow cost of electrochemical technology compared with many of the other technologies\nused makes it an attractive alternative, especially if the enzyme electrodes can be\ninexpensively mass-produced using screen-printing to allow single shot use.\n22\nReferences.\n[1] Jeanty, G., Ghommidh, Ch., Marty, J.L., 2001.
