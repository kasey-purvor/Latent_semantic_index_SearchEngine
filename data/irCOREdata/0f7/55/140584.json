Introduction\nRecently, there has been a large increase in research being conducted on self-powering\nsystems and energy harvesting applications form an integral part of this. Many\ndi\u000berent miniature energy harvesting technologies are being considered at present,\nsolar cells, thermoelectricity, Micro fuel cells, and Micro engines to name a few,\nand this article deals with the one utilizing pyroelectric (PY) e\u000bect. This potential\nuse of temporal temperature gradient in energy harvesting has already been studied\nby various research groups such as Olsen et al [1], Sebald et al [2], and Xie et\nal [3]. In particular, Sebald et al have recently published a number of works on\npyroelectric energy harvesting application with emphasis on potential bene\fts of\nthe non-linear pyroelectricity via Ericsson thermodynamic cycles around the phase\ntransition region. We have recently investigated pyroelectric coe\u000ecient enhancement\nin 2-2 connectivity laminate composites through the improvement in the secondary\npyroelectric coe\u000ecient[4, 5, 6] under both short and open circuit conditions. This\narticle is intended to demonstrate how this enhanced pyroelectric coe\u000ecient can\nimprove the outputs of the pyroelectric energy harvesting application.\nBy exploiting the symmetries of 2-2 connectivity laminates composites of PY and\nnon-pyroelectric (NP) materials, we have previously reported theoretical pyroelectric\ncoe\u000ecient (PY coef) enhancements of up to 800% in PZT5H-Chlorinated polyvinyl\nchloride thermoplastic (CPVC) composites[5] while experimentally demonstrating\nsubstantial PY coef enhancements of more than 100% in PZT-Stainless steel (St)\nLaminate composites with enhanced pyroelectric e\u000bects for energy harvesting 2\nlaminar structures[4]. As it will become evident in section 3, the parameters\nrepresentative of the energy output in PY energy harvesting application are\nproportional to p2m where pm is the PY coef along the m-axis. Hence this increase\nin PY coef should result in very large enhancements in the outputs of the PY\nenergy harvesting application and this enhancement will be investigated in laminate\ncomposites of PY materials such as Lead zirconate titanate (PZT5H and PZT5A),\nBarium titanate (BTO), Lithium tantalate (LTO), Lithium niobate (LNO), and\nPoly-vinylidene \ruoride (PVDF), paired with NP materials such as Stainless steel\n(St), Poly-tetra\ruoroethylene (PTFE or Te\ron), Chlorinated polyvinyl chloride\nthermoplastic (CPVC), Aluminium (Al), Zinc (Zn), and Invar 36 (Invar36).\nIn section 2, a schematics of a simple pyroelectric energy harvesting device which\nconverts a spatial temperature gradient into a temporal one will be exhibited, while\nthe theoretical treatment on its potential performance will be presented in section 3\nvia the derivation of expected maximum power density, e\u000eciency, and electrothermal\ncoupling factor. The \fndings from these analyses on PY-NP laminate composites will\nbe presented in section 4, followed by our conclusion in section 5.\n2. Pyroelectric energy harvesting device\nFigure 1 is a schematic diagram of our PY energy harvesting device. It employs one-\nway Shape memory alloy (SMA)[7] springs with steel ones for returning SMA springs\ninto their original shape and acts as a kind of heat pump transferring heat from hot\nto cold surfaces\/reservoirs. Note that \u0002PY is the temperature of PY element, \u0002SMA\nthe temperature of SMA springs.\nCyclic behaviour from Figures 1(a) to 1(f) then back to 1(a) transforms the spatial\ntemperature gradient between \u0002H (High temperature reservoir and temperature at\nwhich SMA is in austenite phase) and \u0002L (Low temperature reservoir and temperature\nat which SMA is in martensite phase) surfaces into a temporal one. Although the\nexistence of the thermal insulation layer is not essential, it does enable a much\nsimpler phenomenological view of the overall operation while enhancing the actuation\nbehaviour of SMA springs and decreasing the thermal di\u000busion process. Spring\narrangements in \fgure 1 should maximise the surface contact between the PY element\nand temperature surfaces, aiding thermal conduction.\n3. Mathematical treatment of the potential energy output\nIn this section, we shall derive the mathematical expressions for analyzing the\nperformance of the PY energy harvesting device presented in section 2. This\ntheoretical consideration can be applied to any linear pyroelectric energy harvesting\napplication where the thermal stimulus on PY element can be approximated by\nsinusoidal temperature variation.\n3.1. Maximum power density\nIn order to derive the expression for potential power output from the device depicted\nin \fgure 1, we will use similar technique to that employed by Ren et al [8] and Shu\nand Lien[9] in the piezoelectric energy harvesting application. A simple resistive cycle\ncase in Sebald et al 's work[2] and standard interface in Lefeuvre et al 's work[10]\nshould be analogous to this.\nLaminate composites with enhanced pyroelectric e\u000bects for energy harvesting 3\n(a) \u0002PY = \u0002SMA = \u0002L (SMA springs are\nin martensite phase, enabling steel springs to\ncontract and force PY element onto \u0002H surface)\n(b) \u0002PY = \u0002H and \u0002L < \u0002SMA <\n\u0002H (SMA springs start to change\ninto austenite phase, overcoming steel\nsprings' forces and pulling PY towards\n\u0002L surface)\n(c) \u0002PY = \u0002SMA = \u0002H (SMA springs\nare in austenite phase and pull PY\ntowards \u0002L surface)\n(d) \u0002PY = \u0002SMA = \u0002H (SMA springs\nare in austenite phase, stretching steel\nsprings and forcing PY element onto \u0002L\nsurface)\n(e) \u0002PY = \u0002L and \u0002L < \u0002SMA <\n\u0002H (SMA springs start to change\ninto martensite phase, and hence steel\nsprings overcome SMA's forces pulling\nPY towards \u0002H surface)\n(f) \u0002PY = \u0002SMA = \u0002L (SMA springs\nare in martensite phase and the steel\nsprings pull PY towards \u0002H surface)\nFigure 1. Schematics of a pyroelectric energy harvesting device where \u0002PY and\n\u0002SMA are the temperatures of PY element and SMA, respectively.\nAccording to the \frst and second law of thermodynamics, the reversible change\ndU in the internal energy U of an elastic dielectric subjected to a small change of the\nstrain dS, electric displacement dD, and entropy d\u001b is given by;\ndU = \u0002d\u001b + TkldSij + EndDm (3.1)\nwhere \u0002 is the temperature of the material.\nIf one wishes to investigate systems under isothermal conditions, and use electric\n\feld, E, and stress, T , as the independent variables, a Legendre transformation of U\nLaminate composites with enhanced pyroelectric e\u000bects for energy harvesting 4\nhas to be performed by adding the expression \u0000SijTkl\u0000DmEn\u0000\u001b\u0002 to U . This results\nin the following free energy function, which is also know as the Gibbs free energy, G,\nof a piezoelectric crystal[11, 12];\nG = U \u0000 SijTkl \u0000DmEn \u0000 \u001b\u0002 (3.2)\nwhere i, j, k, l, m, n = 1..3.\nAny natural process occurs if and only if the associated change in G of the process\nis negative. Likewise, a system reaches an equilibrium when the associated change in\nG is zero. We now assume constant external electric \feld, i.e. dEn = 0 8n, from the\nde\fnition of short circuit condition[5] and choose the temperature (\u0002), stress (Tij)\nand electric \feld (Em) as the independent variables. By considering the conventional\nnine components of the second order strain and stress tensors, while the magnetic\ne\u000bect is ignored as usual, we get the expression for the change in electric displacement\nunder short circuit condition (3.3).\ndDm =\nX\nk\nX\nl\n\u0012\n@Dm\n@Tkl\n\u0013\nE;\u0002\ndTkl +\nX\nn\n\u0012\n@Dm\n@En\n\u0013\nT;\u0002\ndEn\n+\n\u0012\n@Dm\n@\u0002\n\u0013\nT;E\nd\u0002\n= dE;\u0002mkldTkl + \"\nT\nmndEn + p\nT;E\nm d\u0002\n(3.3)\nAssuming the PY element is free to deform and even 2-2 connectivity laminate\ncomposites behave in a homogeneous manner in this freedom (dTkl = 0), 3.3 can be\nsimpli\fed.\ndDm = \"\nT\nmndEn + p\nT;E\nm d\u0002 (3.4)\nLet thermal stimulus, namely temperature variation inside PY element, be\n\u0002, f frequency (! = 2\u0019f), t time, and \u00020 amplitude of temperature variation\n(\u00020 = (\u0002H \u0000\u0002L) =2).\n) \u0002 = \u00020 exp(i!t) + \u0002L +\u0002H\n2\n) d\u0002\ndt\n= i!\u00020 exp(i!t)\nwith thermal variation assumed to be sinusoidal\n(3.5)\nNow, dQm = AdDm and dEn = dVn=\nPY t where Qm is the charge on the surface,\nA surface area, Vn potential di\u000berence across the thickness of PY element, and\nPY t\nthe thickness of PY element.\nFrom 3.4:\n) dQm = AdDm = A\n\u0000\n\"TmndEn + p\nT;E\nm d\u0002\n\u0001\n=\nA\nPY t\n\"TmndVn +Ap\nT;E\nm d\u0002\n(3.6)\nFrom 3.5:\nLaminate composites with enhanced pyroelectric e\u000bects for energy harvesting 5\n) Im = dQm\ndt\n=\nA\nPY t\n\"Tmn\ndVn\ndt\n+ApT;Em\nd\u0002\ndt\n=\nA\nPY t\n\"Tmn\nd fV0 exp(i(!t+ \u0012))g\ndt\n+ApT;Em (i!\u00020 exp(i!t))\n=\nA\nPY t\n\"Tmn fi!V0 exp(i(!t+ \u0012))g\n+ i!\u00020Ap\nT;E\nm exp(i!t)\n(3.7)\nwhere Im = Current generated from PY element\nV0 = Amplitude of the potential di\u000berence generated across PY element\n\u0012 = Phase di\u000berence between the sinusoidal thermal variation and the potential\ndi\u000berence across PY element\nEquation 3.7 implies the generated potential di\u000berence or voltage across a resistor\nR0 (total external load resistance) will be:\nV = dVn = V0 exp(i(!t+ \u0012)) = R0Im\n= R0\n\u0014\ni!A\"Tmn\nPY t\nV0 exp(i\u0012) + i!\u00020Ap\nT;E\nm\n\u0015\nexp(i!t)\n) V0 exp(i\u0012) = i!R0\u00020Ap\nT;E\nm\n1\u0000 i!R0A\"TmnPY t\n(3.8)\nHence power dissipation averaged over time in the load resistor R0 is:\nPower = P =\nV 20\n2R0\n=\n!2R0\u0002\n2\n0A\n2\n\u0000\npT;Em\n\u00012\n2\nh\n1 +\n!2R20A\n2(\"Tmn)\n2\nPY t2\ni\n=\n!2R0\u0002\n2\n0A\n2\n\u0000\npT;Em\n\u00012\n2 [1 + !2R20C\n2\n0 ]\n(3.9)\nwhere C0 = Capacitance of PY element =\n\"TmnA\nPY t\nNote that this power dissipation in 3.9 is the power generated from PY element,\nwhich in turn gets dissipated by the external load resistor R0.

Results and discussion\nA few of the most widely used PY materials[5], such as PZT (PZT-5H and PZT-\n5A), BTO, LTO, LNO, and PVDF, were paired with six di\u000berent NP materials with\nwide ranging thermal and elastic properties[5], namely, St, PTFE, CPVC, Al, Zn, and\nInvar36, to analyze the resulting laminate composite's energy harvesting credentials.\nAlthough all the 36 pairs were examined, in this communication the conclusions of\nonly selected few with the most interesting results are presented.\nIt must also be noted that in \fgure 1, although \u0002H and \u0002L are shown as the\ntemperatures of hot and cold reservoirs\/heat sources\/drains respectively, as long as\nthe resultant force from steel and SMA springs changes direction at these temperatures\nowing to SMA springs temperature dependent spring constant (Elastic sti\u000bness),\nthe actual temperatures of the hot and cold reservoirs (\u0002hot and \u0002cold) can be\nanything as long as they satisfy \u0002hot > \u0002H and \u0002cold < \u0002L. This facilitates the\npossibility of having potentially huge spatial temperature gradient when PY element\nis in contact with the surfaces of hot and cold reservoirs, which can improve the\nthermal conductivity even further leading to higher available frequency (f), and\nhence ultimately greater Maximum power density (PdenMax). The use of SMA,\nhowever, means the thermal (heating\/cooling) cycle frequency (f) achievable from\nsuch arrangements would still be rather limited. This is one of the main reasons why\nthe frequency range considered in section 4 is constrained to those below or equal to\n1 Hz, dampening the potential energy output available. One way of overcoming this\nLaminate composites with enhanced pyroelectric e\u000bects for energy harvesting 9\nmay be the use of ferromagnetic SMA[14], which can produce actuation frequency\nranges of 200 Hz or more, although the use of magnetic stimuli means more design\ncomplications.\n4.1. Pyroelectric energy harvesting potentials of 2-2 connectivity laminate composites\nAlthough PZT-5A's energy harvesting credentials were also considered, the trend\nwas very similar to that of PZT-5H with smaller numerical values. Hence only the\noutcomes of the latter will be presented as an example of perovskite materials' energy\nharvesting potential. BTO did not demonstrate interesting enough results, while LNO\nbehaved very similarly to LTO with only smaller numerical values. Hence only LTO's\nresults are presented.\n4.1.1. PZT-5H pairs From \fgures 2(a) and 2(b), it is evident that despite PTFE\nand CPVC introducing extreme PY coef enhancements, owing to their high thermal\nexpansion coefs, and possessing very low volumetric heat capacities, it is in fact\nZn, Al, and St with their reasonably high thermal expansion coefs and middle-\nrange volumetric heat capacities that demonstrate the most promise in PY energy\nharvesting (cf. table A3). This is traced back to their high Young's moduli, which\nprovides for su\u000ecient enhancement even at relatively high R values, i.e. even when\nonly small mass of NP material attached. This is a very good example of a case\nwhere pure enhancement in PY coef alone is not enough for good performance in a\nparticular application of PY e\u000bect. Energy harvesting characteristics of PZT5H-Zn,\nPZT5H-Al, and PZT5H-St pairs indicate their great potential in PY energy harvesting\napplications. In particular, noting that all these values are evaluated for the simplest\nresistive cycle case means should much better energy harvesting circuits and storage\ntechnologies be used, there indeed is great potential in these 2-2 connectivity laminate\ncomposites to be exploited in PY energy harvesting application based on both linear\nand non-linear pyroelectricity.\n4.1.2. LTO pairs LNO and LTO's small PY coef enhancement[5] meant that their\n2-2 connectivity laminate composites actually reduced their PY energy harvesting\nabilities as illustrated by Figures 3(a) and 3(b). However, LTO and LNO single\ncrystals by themselves are expected to show the highest PdenMax of all the materials\nand composites considered in this dissertation, implying to its potential employment\nin energy harvesting applications. The reason for this is their relatively high PY coefs\ncoupled with low dielectric constants resulting in high voltage response.\n4.1.3. PVDF pairs Figures 4(a) and 4(b) insinuates that although PVDF pairs also\nfared rather badly when it comes to PY energy harvesting abilities, at higher R values\nsome actually showed slight improvement, PVDF-Invar36 and PVDF-St in particular.\nThis suggests that where PY energy harvesting application is concerned, thin coating\nof Invar36 or St on PVDF (even to act as electrodes) can improve electrical energy\noutput (PdenMax and \u0011Res) of PVDF PY element.\n4.1.4.

Figure 5 illustrates this point very well by closely\napproximating the trends depicted in \fgure 2(a).\nGood k2Lam values predicted for PZT5H-Zn, PZT5H-Al, and to a less extent\nPZT5H-St in \fgure 5 owes largely to NP materials' ability to generate signi\fcantly\nlarge enough PY coef enhancement even at quite high R values while having relatively\nlow cvol, leading to less additional thermal mass. PTFE and CPVC pairs do have a\npeak at low R due to their extreme PY coef enhancements at such R values and their\nextremely low cvol. (cf. table A3)\nIt is also evident from table 1 that LTO single crystal is a very promising PY\nmaterial for energy harvesting application. Although PMN-PT single crystal from\nthe literature exhibits the highest k2 it is expensive and fragile, while PZT\/PVDF-\nHFP composite, another PY element from the literature with great promise, has\nk2 evaluated from electrothermal coupling factor expression not yet adapted for\ncomposites.

However, for\n\u0002H = 310K and \u0002L = 300K considered in our work, total temperature change of\nPY element during one full thermal variation cycle in \fgure 1 is \u0001\u0002 = 2 \u0002 2\u00020 =\n2\u0002 (\u0002H \u0000\u0002L) = 20K. In addition, the movement of PY element from one surface to\nanother is not instantaneous. The time taken for this translation from \fgures 1(a) to\n1(d) would depend on the exact con\fgurations of the SMA and Steel springs.\nHence for a given thermal cycle, the total time it takes for the translation to take\nplace would be \u001ctran = 1 \u0002 2 = 2s. For \u0001\u0002 = 20K temperature variation, the time\nused for changing \u0002PY would be \u001cPY = 0:187\u0002 20 = 3:74s, assuming that SMA and\nSteel springs' temperature changing times are a lot less than PY element's due to\ntheir volume being much smaller. Hence a single thermal cycle process should take\nLaminate composites with enhanced pyroelectric e\u000bects for energy harvesting 14\na maximum of \u001ctotal = \u001ctrans + \u001cPY = 5:74s. This means the maximum thermal\nvariational frequency a 2-2 connectivity laminate composite of PZT5H-St can achieve\nis at least fMax = 1=(\u001ctotal) = 0:175Hz, which is much larger than 0:01Hz used for our\nanalysis. The fact that Xie et al [3] uses heating rate of 15 \u000eCs\u00001, e\u000bectively 0:75Hz\nfrequency for \u0001\u0002 = 20K cycles, on a 150 \u0016m thick PZT-5A demonstrates that this\nshould be achievable, implying 0:01Hz is a conservative and reasonable choice.\n4.2. Pyroelectric energy harvesting potentials of measured laminate samples\nWe now move on to the results of similar analyses performed on the experimental\nsamples whose PY coefs were measured to be enhanced. Should the same samples\nbe measured for their power output with impedance matching circuitry, following\noutcomes in tables 2 \u0018 4 are expected.\nThe frequencies investigated in these tables are; f = 0:0017Hz representing 2\n\u000eCmin\u00001 heating rate (used in the experimentation for testing the samples) applied\nto a \u0001\u0002 = 20K thermal cycle, and f = 0:07 for being the frequency at which some of\nthe tested experimental samples start to achieve maximum power densities (PdenMax)\nlarger than that of a typical thermoelectric module, i.e. 30 Wm\u00003. Where the\ne\u000eciencies are concerned, \u0011Carnot = 0:0323 for \u0002H = 310, while \u0011Carnot = 0:0625\nfor \u0002H = 320.\nTable 2 illustrates energy harvesting parameters bonded 2-2 connectivity laminate\ncomposites of PZT5H-St can produce. Even after taking the di\u000berences in frequencies\ninvestigated into account, the composites in table 2 that possess R > 1 outperform the\ntypical PZT5H's parameters presented in table 1. Although smaller R leads to higher\nPY coef enhancement, it also means larger additional thermal mass from NP layer,\nresulting in larger \u0016cE which in turn has a negative e\u000bect on all the energy harvesting\nparameters, PdenMax, \u0011Res, and k\n2\nLam. As expected, this suggests maximising the PY\ncoef alone is not enough to optimise the energy harvesting system and other issues\nsuch as the additional thermal mass needs to be considered.\nWhere the electrothermal coupling factor for laminate composite (k2Lam) is\nconcerned Sample XIR7 with R = 1:068 has the highest value, leading to highest\nmaximum power densities of 32.2 and 129.0 Wm\u00003 at f = 0:07Hz for \u0002H = 310 and\n\u0002H = 320 respectively. All the samples with R > 1 depict a rather large PdenMax,\nlarger than 100 Wm\u00003 at f = 0:07Hz for \u0002H = 320, insinuating their potential\ndeployment in energy harvesting application. Bearing in mind that the frequency\nand temperature variations used for these calculations are all viewed as reasonably\nconservative values, there is a good chance that these composites, or similar composites\nwith di\u000berent PY or NP materials such as Zn, Al, or CPVC (cf. \fgure 5) could well\n\fnd their use in PY energy harvesting.\nFigures 6, 7, and 8 summarizes the \fndings from table 2. Interfacial factor k 1 (a\nratio of strain loss across the PY and NP layers' interface)[4, 5] is employed to describe\nthe e\u000bect of imperfect boding layer. It is clear from these \fgures that as long as the\nthickness ratio (R) is larger than certain value and the bonding quality is reasonably\ngood, 2-2 connectivity laminate composites of PZT-5H will outperform stand alone\nPZT-5H in the energy harvesting application.\nIn \fgure 6(a), a theoretical PdenMax should f = 1Hz be possible is displayed.\nWith PY coef enhancement of over 100% predicted, theoretically over 500 Wm\u00003\nor 0.5 mWcm\u00003 is shown to be possible.

This measure for PY energy harvesting\ncredentials was developed to assess a PY material or composite's potential in PY\nenergy harvesting application. As such, it is independent of frequency and temperature\nvariation amplitude (cf. 4.1). It is evident from \fgure 8 that it predicts PZT5H-St\nlaminate composite's performance in both PdenMax and \u0011Res quite well, with up to\ndoubling of k2Lam under optimal conditions.\nChanges in energy harvesting parameters as a PZT-5H is evaluated, then as it\nis bonded to St forming a laminate composite (cf. table 2), are displayed in Table\nLaminate composites with enhanced pyroelectric e\u000bects for energy harvesting 17\n0.0E+00\n1.0E-06\n2.0E-06\n3.0E-06\n4.0E-06\n5.0E-06\n6.0E-06\n7.0E-06\n8.0E-06\n9.0E-06\n1.0E-05\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5\nThickness ratio R\nEf\nfic\nie\nn\ncy\nk=1.00 k=0.75\nk=0.50 PZT5H alone\nExperimental\n(a) \u0002L = 300K, \u0002H = 310K, f = 0:07Hz, and\n\u0011Carnot = 0:0323\n0.0E+00\n2.0E-06\n4.0E-06\n6.0E-06\n8.0E-06\n1.0E-05\n1.2E-05\n1.4E-05\n1.6E-05\n1.8E-05\n2.0E-05\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5\nThickness ratio R\nEf\nfic\nie\nn\ncy\nk=1.00 k=0.75\nk=0.50 PZT5H alone\nExperimental\n(b) \u0002L = 300K, \u0002H = 320K, f = 0:07Hz,\nand \u0011Carnot = 0:0625 (Increasing temperature\nvariation amplitude)\nFigure 7.

Samples up to R < 0:534 show reduction in their parameters despite large\nPercentile \u0001p of up to 88.3% owing to increased thermal mass from the introduction\nof NP layer. XI6 (R = 2:670) showed the best improvement in all the parameters\ndespite its relatively low Percentile \u0001p of 63.8%. In fact, near doubling of PdenMax\n(95.1% increase), and both \u0011Res and k\n2\nLam (83.1% increase) indicates that attaching a\nthin layer of St may be the best route for improving PY energy harvesting with PZT-\n5H. One of the main reasons behind this is St's large cvol (3.91 \u0002 106 Jm\u00003K\u00001),\nwhich is even larger than that of PZT-5H (3.15 \u0002 106 Jm\u00003K\u00001). Use of other NP\nmaterials such as Al (cvol = 2.40 \u0002 106 Jm\u00003K\u00001), or even PTFE and CPVC with\n0.72 and 1.40 \u0002 106 Jm\u00003K\u00001 respectively, should aid in reducing this hinderance to\nimprovement.

It represents a case where both PZT-5H\nand St were assumed present when considering both before and after bonding. Hence\nthis represents the case where the overall volume of initial materials (as PY and NP\nare not yet bonded, they are not a composite) is equal to the volume of resultant\nlaminate composite after bonding. As there is no additional thermal mass (volume)\nafter the bonding (it was added beforehand), the only quantity that a\u000bects the energy\nharvesting parameters is the enhanced PY coef. This correlation between Percentile\n\u0001p and the improvements in all three energy harvesting parameters is also present in\ntable 4, which formed the basis for Figure 10.\nAs one would expect, in the case of table 4 and \fgure 10, larger the PY coef\nenhancement larger the improvement in the energy harvesting parameters. It must\nbe noted that all three parameters demonstrated the same amount of percentile\nimprovement since the only reason Percentile \u0001PdenMax behaved di\u000berently from the\nother two parameters in table 3 was due to its dependence on the overall volume and\nindependence of heat capacities. Sample XI7 (R = 1:068) is expected to show up to\n240% increase in PdenMax, \u0011Res, and k\n2\nLam from PY coef enhancement of only 84.4%,\nwhich suggests that thin PZT-5H with thick St attached could improve the overall\nenergy harvesting performance quite drastically for the same volume of PY material\nand 2-2 connectivity laminate composite. This indicates that the use of thin-\flms, or\nat least the thinnest possible bulk material, in the PY energy harvesting applications\nwill be a good idea despite the scaling behaviour of thin \flms, as this leads to reduction\nin the signi\fcantly negative role played by the additional thermal mass. In addition,\nuse of other NP materials with lower cvol values than that of PZT-5H, such as Al, Zn,\nLaminate composites with enhanced pyroelectric e\u000bects for energy harvesting 21\nPTFE or CPVC, should lead to even larger improvements as this will lead to reduced\nthermal mass. This reduced thermal mass should also enable the use of higher f\nvalues, potentially resulting in very high PdenMax, \u0011Res, and k\n2\nLam.\nAlthough we only focused our attention on the linear pyroelectricity based energy\nharvesting application as this employs pyroelectricity under the short circuit condition,\nunder which we have experimental results of the enhancement as stated in our previous\ncommunications[4, 5], it should be noted that analysis on the phase transition based\nnon-linear pyroelectric e\u000bect should also be possible. However, it requires the use\nof the pyroelectric coe\u000ecients under both short and open circuit electric boundary\nconditions while its practical realization also necessitates additional electronic circuitry\nsuch as synchronised electric charge extraction (SECE)[15] or synchronised switch\nharvesting on inductor(SSHI)[16]. Hence we have only dealt with simpler case of\nlinear pyroelectric e\u000bect with resistive load in this communication although we have\nno doubt that our enhanced 2-2 connectivity laminate composites can also improve\nthe performance of non-linear pyroelectric energy harvesting application. In addition,\nvarious hybrids of this and other methods of energy harvesting also exist, such as\nthe hybrid between magnetostriction and piezoelectricity in Magnetoelectric[17, 18]\ndevices, and it is hoped that our work can also \fnd use in such applications as well.\n5. Conclusion\nMathematical expressions\/parameters that are important in judging the energy\nharvesting credentials of any PY material or PY-NP 2-2 connectivity laminate\ncomposites, namely Maximum power density PdenMax, E\u000eciency \u0011Res, and\nElectrothermal coupling factor k2 have been derived. In doing so, it is discovered\nthat while electrothermal coupling factor (k2) quoted in the literature[2] is adequate\nfor stand alone PY materials, for PY coef enhanced laminate composites its more\ngeneral counterpart in electrothermal coupling factor speci\fcally designed for laminate\ncomposites (k2Lam from 4.1) should be used. It seems possible that for other\nconnectivity con\fgurations of composites, various electrothermal coupling factor\nexpressions may be needed. The main application parameters that a\u000bect PdenMax\nare identi\fed as \u0002H \u0000\u0002L and f , while \u0011Res was independent of f , and k2Lam of both.\nThe independence of k2Lam from (\u0002H \u0000\u0002L) and f made it an ideal parameter for\njudging the energy harvesting credentials of PY materials or composites, provided\n\u0002H is su\u000eciently large enough. Comparisons between PY material without and\nwith added NP layers (di\u000berent total volume), and between PY material with NP\n(not bonded) and its laminate composite counterpart of the same volume have been\nmade. It was discerned that percentile improvement in k2Lam (Percentile \u0001k\n2\nLam) was\nable to demonstrate a proportional correlation with the percentile improvement in\nPdenMax (Percentile \u0001PdenMax) in both cases, which percentile PY coef enhancement\n(Percentile \u0001p) failed to do in the case of di\u000bering volumes due to the introduction of\nadditional thermal mass in the form of NP layer leading to dissimilar volume expression\nbefore and after the bonding of the laminate composite.\nFrom considering the resistive cycle energy harvesting credentials of the thirty-\nsix PY-NP 2-2 connectivity laminate composites, LTO single crystal was determined\nto show immense promise as a prime PY material candidate for energy harvesting\napplication. PZT5H-Zn (R = 1:005) and PZT5H-CPVC (R = 0:045) 2-2 connectivity\nlaminate composites also display potential in PY energy harvesting application.\nIn particular, PZT5H-Zn (R = 1:005) composite's PdenMax of 12.35 Wm\n\u00003 at\nLaminate composites with enhanced pyroelectric e\u000bects for energy harvesting 22\n\u0002L = 300K, \u0002H = 310K, and f = 0:01Hz, is very respectable, which can easily be\nfurther improved by increasing \u0002H \u0000 \u0002L and f , when compared to that of a typical\nthermoelectric module, i.e. 30 Wm\u00003[2]. The possibility of further improvements\nwere noted by facilitating potentially huge spatial temperature gradient when PY\nelement is in contact with the surfaces of hot and cold reservoirs, which can improve\nthe thermal conductivity even further leading to higher available frequency (f), and\nhence ultimately greater PdenMax.\nWhen bonded laminate composites of PZT-5H and St were considered, the\ncomposites with R > 1 outperformed the typical PZT5H's energy harvesting\nparameters. Although smaller R leads to higher PY coef enhancement, it also means\nlarger additional thermal mass from NP layer, resulting in larger e\u000bective volumetric\nheat capacity ( \u0016cE) which in turn has a negative e\u000bect on all the energy harvesting\nparameters, PdenMax, \u0011Res, and k\n2\nLam. This suggests maximising the PY coef alone\nis not enough to optimise the energy harvesting system. Other issues such as the\nadditional thermal mass needs to be considered.\nAppendices\nAppendix A.1. Time constant derivation\nAppendix A.1.1.
