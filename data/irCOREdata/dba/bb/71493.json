Children read short stories each \ncontaining a different novel word and defined the word at the end of each \nstory. There were three intervention sessions.

Children in the two explanation groups made the \ngreatest gains in definition accuracy. The implications for teaching vocabulary \nlearning skills are discussed.  \n \nWord count: 135 \nDeriving word meanings from context, 4 \n 4 \nDeriving word meanings from context:  \nDoes explanation facilitate contextual analysis? \n \nChildren with typically developing language skills have a remarkable ability \nto acquire new vocabulary: word-learning rates of up to 3,000 words per year \nfor 6-11 year-olds have been proposed (Nagy & Scott, 2000). One source of \nnew vocabulary is written text. It has been estimated that the average 10-year-\nold will encounter one million words in text each year, of which \napproximately 20,000 words will be unfamiliar in their written form \n(Anderson & Freebody, 1983). Written language is lexically richer than \nspoken language. As children become fluent readers and read more advanced \ntexts they will have to learn the meanings of words that are not part of their \noral vocabulary. The meanings of other words they encounter will not be fully \nestablished. Information about a word\u2019s meaning may come from internal \nclues in the words, such as its root or prefix, and from external clues in the \ncontext in which the word is presented (Fukkink, 2005). This paper focuses on \nhow children learn to derive the meanings of words from external clues in \nwritten contexts.  \nAlthough context will not always reveal word meanings, the \nopportunities afforded by written contexts to learn the meanings of new \nwords and to elaborate and consolidate the meanings of less familiar words \nare substantial. A large body of research supports the view that children are \nable to derive the meanings (or partial meanings) of new vocabulary items \nwhen reading (Carnine, Kameenui, & Coyle, 1984; Jenkins, Matlock, & \nSlocum, 1989; McKeown, 1985; Nagy, Herman & Anderson, 1987; Swanborn \n& de Glopper, 1999, 2002: see Cunningham, 2005, and Nagy & Scott, 2000, for \nDeriving word meanings from context, 5 \n 5 \nreviews). Derivation of word meanings from context is considered an \nimportant means of vocabulary extension and is included in the UK National \nLiteracy Strategy Framework for Teaching Primary National Strategy for 7-8-\nyear-olds. Yet we know little about how children learn to focus on the text as \nan appropriate source of information about a word\u2019s meaning and the ease \nwith which they identify the relevant contextual clues from which to \naccurately infer the (partial) meanings of new words or confirm the meanings \nof unfamiliar words.  \nThe characteristics of different programmes designed to teach children \nhow to derive word meanings from context vary considerably. Some \u2018teach\u2019 \nthe strategy of inference from context by providing a simple rule or \nexplanation of why context is useful, e.g., \u201cWhen there\u2019s a hard word in a \nsentence, you look for other words in the story that tell you more about the \nword\u201d (Carnine et al., 1984, p.198), followed by practice in reading texts and \ndefining target words. Other instruction programmes provide greater detail \nabout the types of contextual clues that are available, such as definition, \nsynonym or antonym clues (Baumann, Font, Edwards, & Boland, 2005) or \ndifferent stages in the meaning derivation process, e.g., substitution of target \nword with a synonym, checking that the context supports the substitution, \nand revising the idea if necessary (Jenkins et al., 1989). A meta-analysis of \ndifferent treatments found that simple rule instruction was more effective \nthan some of the more detailed and explicit ones (Fukkink & de Glopper, \n1998). \nMany studies of vocabulary learning from context have investigated \ndirected or deliberate learning, where attention is directed to the target word. \nAs a result, these studies might overestimate the use of this strategy in the \nDeriving word meanings from context, 6 \n 6 \nreal world, in which word learning is incidental to the activity of reading \n(Swanborn & de Glopper, 1999). The advantage of the directed learning \nmethodology is that it enables the researcher to pinpoint the source of any \ndifficulties in deriving new word meanings from context. Fukkink (2005) \nexploited this method to analyse the processes used by untrained readers as \nthey attempted to derive word meanings from context. Children in grades 2, \n4, and 6 were asked to \u2018think-aloud\u2019 as they read a story with a target word, \nfor which they were subsequently required to produce a meaning. All age \ngroups were capable of inferring meanings, evaluating their response, and \neither accepting or rejecting it, but they did not necessarily carry out these \nbehaviours on each trial or do so successfully. Fukkink\u2019s study suggests that \nyoung readers are capable of sophisticated word derivation behaviours \nwithout formal instruction, which may explain why a simple direction \u2018to \nlook for contextual clues\u2019 is effective. If children are already capable of \ncontextual analysis to a degree, the instruction to use the context may be \nsufficient to focus their attention on this source of information and improve \ntheir ability to learn about word meanings through context. \nChildren not only need to look to the context as a source of \ninformation, they also need to analyse the text to select the clues that are \nrelevant and to discard those that are not. Fukkink (2005) found that many \nchildren failed to evaluate the adequacy of their inferred word meaning with \nthe story content. In a recent study of 7-8-year-olds\u2019 inference making, \nBrand\u00e3o and Oakhill (2005) identified a method that might develop \nevaluation and contextual analysis skills, which was investigated in the \ncurrent study: explanation. Brand\u00e3o and Oakhill were interested in the \nsources of information used by children to answer inference-tapping \nDeriving word meanings from context, 7 \n 7 \nquestions. Children read short stories and answered questions after each one. \nTo identify further the source of information used to answer each question, \nchildren were asked to justify their responses with the prompt \u2018How do you \nknow that answer?\u2019 Children used both general knowledge and story context \nto derive their responses. In some instances, children generated an incorrect \ninference because they selected either irrelevant information or only some of \nthe relevant context from the text. Some children changed their answer from \nan incorrect to a correct one during their justification, as they reasoned and \nthought about the story. Brand\u00e3o and Oakhill suggest that explanations could \nbe used to improve children\u2019s comprehension, by making them aware of what \nthey remember and what the text actually says. \nSupport for the facilitatory role of explanation in learning comes from \nSiegler\u2019s work of children\u2019s strategy acquisition in relation to number skills \n(see Siegler, 1996, for a review). In a classic study, Siegler (1995) studied how \nexplanation helped children to develop the principle of number conservation. \nChildren who could not already solve number conservation problems \ncompleted four training sessions. One group was asked to explain the \nreasoning behind their answer on each trial and then received feedback: they \nwere told whether their answer was correct or not. A second group was given \nfeedback first and asked to explain how the experimenter knew the correct \nanswer. A third (control) received feedback only. The second group of \nchildren, who were required to explain the reasoning that lay behind the \nexperimenter\u2019s correct answer, made greater gains on the task than did the \nchildren who explained their own reasoning. At outset, all groups attempted \na range of strategies to solve the problems. This finding suggests that \nDeriving word meanings from context, 8 \n 8 \nreflecting on the reasoning of an expert helps the learner to acquire or identify \nmore sophisticated problem solving strategies.  \nIn a recent study of early numeracy development, Muldoon, Lewis and \nFrancis (in press) found that children benefited equally from explanation of \neither their own (sometimes incorrect) response or the experimenter\u2019s correct \nresponse. Explanation per se might increase the learner\u2019s awareness of their \nperformance on this task and help them to evaluate whether the strategy used \nwas successful or not. Number and conservation skills are conceptually \ndifferent domains from language and literacy and it is not known whether the \nsame interventions that facilitate performance in the former, e.g., explanation, \nwill facilitate performance in the latter.  \nThe current study \nThis review of the literature demonstrates that analysis of context is an \nimportant means through which young readers can consolidate and extend \ntheir vocabularies. The study of strategy acquisition in relation to number \nskills, reveals that a range of skills and strategies are used even by novices to \ncomplete a new task and that explanation might be a useful instructional tool \nto help children to develop and select the most effective way to perform the \ntask. The role of explanation in relation to vocabulary acquisition has not been \nsystematically studied.  \nThis study investigated the use of explanation to facilitate children\u2019s \nability to derive word meanings from story context. Siegler\u2019s (1995) design \nwas used and children were assigned to one of three groups. One group was \nrequired to explain how they worked out their own (sometimes incorrect) \ndefinition of a word and then received feedback, another group was provided \nwith the feedback first and asked to explain how the experimenter worked \nDeriving word meanings from context, 9 \n 9 \nout the correct meaning for the word, and a third group was given feedback \non the accuracy of their definition, but were not required to explain how they \nderived their definition. All children participated in three intervention \nsessions and a final post-intervention session, in which feedback was not \ngiven and explanations were not required.  \nThe primary aim of this study was to investigate whether or not \nexplanation facilitates children\u2019s ability to derive accurate word meanings \nfrom context. It was predicted that the two explanation groups would \nimprove in their performance on the word definition task to a greater extent \nthan the feedback only (control) group. This prediction was tested by \nanalysing the scores awarded for the derived word meanings in each session, \nand by examining the amount of improvement found between session one \nand the post-test. Differences between the two explanation groups were not \npredicted a priori because of the contrasting findings of Siegler (1995) and \nMuldoon et al (in press). \nA subsidiary aim was to explore the factors that drive improvement on \nthe task. If explanation works, it might lead to an improvement in the quality \nof derivation scores in two different ways. It may simply encourage a shift to \nthe text as a source of information for novel word meanings. It may have a \nmore specific effect: children may already use the text as a source of \ninformation, and explanation may help them to become more selective at \nidentifying the relevant information (as suggested by Brand\u00e3o and Oakhill, \n2005). However, explanation may not benefit literacy skills to the same extent \nas has been found for number skills, where application of a rule leads to the \ncorrect response. Feedback and practice alone might be beneficial for \ndeveloping skilled use of context.  \nDeriving word meanings from context, 10 \n 10 \nQualitative analysis of the different types of word definition (story \ncorrect, story-related, other) produced by the three groups during the \nintervention phase, session by session, was conducted.  This analysis \ndetermined if the source of information used to derive the word meanings \n(from external \u2013 other - to story-based) changed during the course of the \nintervention, and whether the effects were general or group-specific. In \nconjunction with the analysis of points awarded for definitions, this analysis \nenables us to determine whether a particular treatment condition prompted \nchildren to focus on the text or to analyse the text more accurately. A session-\nby-session analysis of the different types of explanation (story-related, \nexternal to the story, other) produced by the two explanation groups explored \nthis issue further. \n \nMethod \nParticipants \nForty-five children aged 7-8 years participated in this study. They were \nselected from an initial sample of 105 children in three schools with \npredominantly middle-class catchment areas in the east of England. All \nchildren completed a multiple-choice measure of listening comprehension \nand a modification of the British Picture Vocabulary Scales (BPVS), both of \nwhich were group administered. These measures were used to inform \nassignment to groups. First, children were grouped in triples with scores \nmatched as closely as possible. Each member of a triple was assigned to a \ndifferent treatment condition, so that each condition included children with a \nsimilar range of ability. The reason for this was that children with superior \nlanguage comprehension skills may learn to derive word meanings from \nDeriving word meanings from context, 11 \n 11 \ncontext with greater ease and those with superior verbal skills will produce \nbetter explanations. \nThe listening comprehension test was modified from the Neale Analysis \nof Reading Ability - Revised (NARA-II: Neale, 1997) to make it suitable for group \nadministration. The first three stories from Form 2 were read out to the \nchildren, who followed each story in their own booklet. After each story they \nanswered the prescribed set of questions, designed to test their memory and \nunderstanding for the story. For each question they were required to choose \none out of three printed answers: the correct answer and two incorrect \nresponses, selected from responses that children had given in previous pilot \nwork. Responses were scored as either correct or incorrect and the maximum \npossible score was 20. This test had an acceptable level of reliability \n(Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = .65). \nThe receptive vocabulary test was a modified version of the British \nPicture Vocabulary Scale - Second Edition (Dunn, Dunn, Whetton, & Burley, \n1997, see Cunningham & Stanovich, 1991, for a similar modification). \nChildren were presented with 20 items in individual booklets. The \nexperimenter read out the word and the child ticked the corresponding \npicture in their booklet. One point was awarded for each correct answer. This \ntest had a good level of reliability (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = .70). \nParental consent was obtained for all children (N=105) prior to the start \nof the study. Children who performed at floor or ceiling on these tests, those \nwho did not speak British English as their first language, and those receiving \nadditional classroom support for reading or learning difficulties were \nexcluded from the study. The remaining children (N=54) were allocated to \none of the three experimental groups.  \nDeriving word meanings from context, 12 \n 12 \nIt was not possible to conduct a separate pre-test of children\u2019s ability to \nuse contextual cues to infer the meanings of novel words because of the \nschools\u2019 constraints on the number of sessions allowed with each child. \nTherefore, the first story of the first session served as an index of this ability. \nThe data for children who provided the correct (target) interpretations for the \nnovel word in this story and those who missed sessions through absence are \nexcluded from the analyses reported (N=9). After exclusions, there were \nfifteen children in each condition. The feedback-only (FO) group comprised 7 \ngirls and 8 boys: mean age = 8 years, 3 months (SD=2.2); mean \ncomprehension = 15.1 (SD=1.8); mean vocabulary = 16.5 (SD=1.9). The \nfeedback plus explain own reasoning (FOR) group comprised 8 girls and 7 \nboys: age = 8 years, 2 months (SD=2.1); comprehension  = 14.0 (SD=2.8); \nvocabulary = 15.6 (SD=2.6). The feedback plus explain experimenter\u2019s (FER) \nreasoning group comprised 8 girls and 7 boys: age = 8 years, 3 months \n(SD=2.3); comprehension = 15.2 (2.4); vocabulary = 15.0 (2.4). Two one-way \nanalyses of variance were conducted in which the total comprehension scores \nand total vocabulary scores were the dependent variables.  There were no \nsignificant group differences, both Fs < 1.62, ps > .20.  \nExperimental materials  \n Sixteen stories each with a novel word were used in this study. These \nstories were adapted from a set of materials developed for two previous studies \n(Cain, Oakhill, & Elbro, 2003; Cain, Oakhill, & Lemmon, 2004). Each story \ncontained contextual clues from which the target definition could be inferred. \nAn example is provided in Table 1. The stories were tested on eight \nundergraduate students. Their responses indicated that the meanings of the \nnovel words could only be determined from the useful context: none of the \nDeriving word meanings from context, 13 \n 13 \nword meanings was guessed correctly without context and all were correctly \ninferred with context present. The 16 novel word stories were divided into four \nsets: four different stories were selected for sessions 1-3 and the post-test. Each \nchild was presented with the same stories in each session in a fixed order.  \n_____________________ \nTable 1 around here \n_____________________ \nProcedure \nAt the beginning of the first session, the experimenter read out the following \ninstructions: \u201cI have some stories that I am going to read out loud to you. I \nwant you to follow the stories in the booklet in front of you. The person who \nwrote them got a bit stuck at times and didn\u2019t always know the right words to \nput in so they\u2019ve put in a made-up word instead. At the end of the story I will \nask you to explain the meaning of the word. For example, if I asked you what \na bed was, you might tell me that it was \u2018a long piece of furniture that we \nsleep in\u2019.\u201d  \nAt the end of each story, children were asked to explain the meaning of \nthe novel word, e.g.,  \u201cWhat do you think bope means?\u201d Children in the \nfeedback-only (FO) group were given feedback on their response (whether it \nwas correct or not) but were not asked to explain their interpretation of the \nnovel word. For example, \u201cthat was a good answer, a bope is a gap in the \nfence or hedge\u201d or \u201cthat was a good answer, but actually a bope is a gap in \nthe fence or hedge.\u201d If they did not provide an explanation for the word\u2019s \nmeaning e.g., \u2018don\u2019t know\u2019 responses, they were simply told the meaning of \nthe word. Children in the feedback plus explain own reasoning (FOR) group \nwere asked to explain their interpretation of the novel word, before they \nDeriving word meanings from context, 14 \n 14 \nreceived feedback on their response. For example, if they were correct: \u201cHow \ndid you work out that bope means a gap in the fence or hedge?\u201d or if they \ngave another response: \u201cHow did you work out that bope means a bully\/ \nbull\/ boat\/ tree\/ rope\/ saddle\/ whistle?\u201d (All examples are taken from \nactual responses.) They were then given feedback as described above. The \nchildren in the feedback plus explain experimenter\u2019s reasoning (FER) group \nwere given feedback on their response first. Whether or not their initial \nresponse was correct, they were then asked to explain the experimenter\u2019s \nreasoning, e.g., \u201cYes, that\u2019s right, a bope is a gap in the fence. I worked that \nout as well. How do you think I worked out that bope means a gap in the \nfence or hedge?\u201d or \u201cNo, actually a bope is a gap in the fence. How do you \nthink I worked out that a bope means a gap in the fence?\u201d This wording was \nused because previous (unpublished) work revealed that \u201cHow do you think \nI knew that?\u201d lead to a standard \u201cbecause you are an adult\u201d response.  \nAll sessions were audio-recorded and transcribed for scoring and \nanalysis. \nClassification of definitions and explanations \nDefinitions. Correct definitions could be either partially correct, e.g., \u2018a \nfence\u2019, or wholly correct, \u2018a gap in the fence\u2019. These responses were awarded 1 \npoint and 2 points, respectively. Other definitions were scored as incorrect \nand were not awarded any points. They were classified as follows: story-\nrelated, e.g., \u2018another bull in the field\u2019; a similar sounding word, e.g., \u2018boat\u2019, or \n\u2018rope\u2019; a definition that was not related to the story content and was not a \nsimilar sounding word, e.g., \u2018saddle\u2019; no definition, e.g., \u2018don\u2019t know\u2019. All \nresponses were scored blind by two raters (the author and another) who \nagreed on 662 responses out of a total for 720. Disagreements were resolved \nDeriving word meanings from context, 15 \n 15 \nby discussion. Kappa for the agreement between the two raters was .88, which \nindicated a high level of agreement.  \nExplanations. The explanations provided by the FOR and FER groups in \nSessions 1 to 3 were categorised, regardless of whether the actual response \nwas a correct definition or not. There were three main types of explanation \n(examples for the word bope). Story-based explanations included reference to \ndetails of the story, e.g., for a correct definition \u2018it said that he squeezed \nthrough it, so it wasn\u2019t where there\u2019s a plank and you step on it and jump off\u2019, \nfor an incorrect definition that a \u2018bope\u2019 was another bull in the field \u2018because \nthere was a bull in the story\u2019. Story-external explanations were made-up \nanswers such as \u2018I\u2019ve heard of that before\u2019 and reference to an adult\u2019s superior \nknowledge (for the FER group), e.g., \u2018perhaps you looked it up in a book\u2019. \nOther explanations were either sound-based, which were few and used \nexclusively for similar sounding words, e.g., for the definition \u2018a little boat\u2019 \nthe explanation provided was \u2018a bope sounds a bit like a boat\u2019, \u2018don\u2019t know\u2019 \nresponses. The same two raters, blind to learning condition, scored the \nexplanations. They agreed on 324 of a total of 360 explanations. Kappa for the \nagreement between the two raters was .84, which indicated a good level of \nagreement.  Disagreements were resolved by discussion.  \nResults \nWhere appropriate, partial eta squared (\u03b7p2) is reported as a measure of effect \nsize. This value estimates the proportion of total variance accounted for by the \nindependent variable.   \nDoes explanation facilitate children\u2019s ability to derive accurate word meanings from \ncontext?  \nDeriving word meanings from context, 16 \n 16 \nA two-way analysis of variance was conducted on the word definition \ntotal scores obtained in each session (one, two, three, post-test) by each group \n(FER, FOR, FO) to determine whether explanation of definitions promoted the \nuse of context to derive word meanings. The mean scores obtained in these \nsessions are reported in Table 2. Group was a between-subjects variables and \nsession was a within-subjects variable. The effect of group was not significant, \nF < 1.0. There was a highly significant and sizeable effect of session, F(3,126) = \n42.54, p< .001, \u03b7p2 = .50, but the interaction between group and session did not \nreach significance, F(6,126) = 1.22, p > .20. Thus, all groups improved their \nperformance across sessions.  \nThe control group started with a higher level of competence on this \ntask than the other two groups (see Table 2). To control for the effects of \nperformance at outset, an additional analysis was conducted on the difference \n(or improvement) between scores obtained in each pair of sessions (one and \ntwo; two and three; three and four) with group as a between-subjects factor. \nThere was a small but significant effect of group, F(2, 42) = 3.41, p < .05 \u03b7p2 = \n.14,: the FER and FER groups showed the greatest improvement in \nperformance between pairs of session (Ms=1.36, for both) and the FO group \nthe least (M= .87). No other effects were significant, Fs < 2.0, ps > .15. Thus, \nthe two explanation groups made greater gains in performance across \nsessions than the feedback only group. \n \n_____________________ \nTable 2 around here \n_____________________ \n \nDeriving word meanings from context, 17 \n 17 \nTo explore further the benefits of explanation, the performance of the \nchildren who were poorest at the meaning derivation task (scoring 0 or 1 \npoint) in the first intervention session was examined. There were 8 children in \nthe FOR group, 9 in the FER group, and 6 in the FO group who met this \ncriterion. The difference in scores obtained in the two sessions was greatest \nfor the FOR group (M=5.37, SD=1.27) and the FER groups (M=4.44, SD=1.89) \nand smallest for the FO group (M=3.58, SD=1.32). The group sizes were too \nsmall for reliable statistical analysis. However, the pattern of the means \nsupport the main analyses: the feedback only group had more sophisticated \nword derivation skills at outset, but explanation led to greater improvements \nin meaning derivation.  \nWhat facilitates improvements in use of context? \n To explore the factors that lead to improved use of context, analysis of \nthe types of definition (for all groups) and explanation (FER and FOR groups \nonly) was conducted.  \nDefinitions. The mean numbers of different types of word definition \nproduced during the intervention phase are reported in Table 3. The different \nresponse types are not independent so the \u2018other\u2019 response category data \nwere excluded from this analysis. The remaining data were analysed in an \nanalysis of variance with group (FER, FOR, FO) as a between-subjects factor \nand intervention session (1, 2, 3) and definition type (story correct, story \nrelated) as within-subjects factors.  \nThere was a main effect of session, F(2,84) = 3.38, p < .05, \u03b7p2 = .08 and a \nmain effect of definition type, F(1,42) = 4.24, p < .05, \u03b7p2 = .09. These two \neffects were qualified by a two-way interaction, F(2,84) = 12.72, p < .001, \u03b7p2 = \n.23. The interaction arose because a greater number of story-related responses \nDeriving word meanings from context, 18 \n 18 \nthan story correct responses were made in session one (Ms = 1.11 and 1.71, \nrespectively), but the reverse pattern was found in sessions two (Ms = 1.04 \nand 1.73) and three (Ms = 1.09 and 2.07). The interaction indicates a specific \nshift to more accurate analysis of the content of the text, rather than a general \nshift from external to story-based responses. No other main effects or \ninteractions reached conventional levels of significance, all Fs < 2.04, ps > .09. \nImportantly, there was no main effect of group and group was not involved \nin any interactions with other variables. Thus, the focus onto the text arose for \nall groups either as a result of practice and feedback, and was not limited to \nthe groups who provided explanations.  \n_____________________ \nTable 3 around here \n_____________________ \n \nExplanations. The total number of explanations that related a response \nto the content of the story, whether or not the response was correct (story-\nrelated), an external source (story external), the sound of the word and don\u2019t \nknow responses (other) was calculated for each child in the two explanation \ngroups, for responses in the three learning sessions in which explanations \nwere required. There were few \u2018sounds like\u2019 explanations so these were \nincluded in the \u2018other\u2019 category. The mean totals are reported in Table 4. \n These data were not independent so an analysis was conducted to \ncompare story-related and story external explanations. These data were \ntreated as the dependent variable in an analysis with group as a between-\nsubjects and session and explanation type as within-subjects variable. There \nwas a significant effect of type, F(1,28) = 18.81, p < .001, \u03b7p2 = .40, because \nDeriving word meanings from context, 19 \n 19 \nstory-based explanations were the more common, in general. There was also a \nsignificant interaction between explanation type and session, F(1,56) = 3.63, p \n< .05, \u03b7p2 = .15. Tukey posthoc comparisons revealed significant differences in \nthe number of story-based and external explanations in sessions two and \nthree, p < .01, but not in session one. There was also a significant interaction \nbetween explanation type and group, F(1,28) = 8.69, p < .01, \u03b7p2 = .24. Tukey \nposthoc comparisons revealed that the FOR group made a greater number of \nstory-based than external explanations in general, p < .001, but this \ncomparison was not significant for the FER group. No other effects or \ninteractions reached significance, all Fs < .1.0.   \n_____________________ \nTable 4 around here \n_____________________ \n \nDiscussion \nThe main aim of this study was to determine whether or not explanation \nwould facilitate 7-8-year-olds\u2019 ability to analyse story context to derive novel \nword meanings. In three intervention sessions children received feedback on \nthe accuracy of the meaning they had derived for a novel word, presented in a \nsupportive narrative context. In general, all children improved in the quality \nof their word definitions, but the greatest gains were seen for children who \nexplained either their own (often incorrect) definition or the experimenter\u2019s \ncorrect definition. Although the groups who provided explanations were \nmore accurate in their use of story content to generate word definitions, \nqualitative analysis of the word definitions revealed that all groups were \nmore likely to consider the text as the source of information to derive word \nDeriving word meanings from context, 20 \n 20 \nmeanings by the end of the intervention phase. In addition, analysis of the \nexplanations revealed that the group who explained their own definitions \nappeared to have greater insight into the derivation of the word meanings \nthan the group who explained the experimenter\u2019s correct answer. The key \nfindings and the implications for instruction and practice in vocabulary \nlearning skills will be discussed. \nExplanation facilitated children\u2019s performance on the word definition \ntask: children who made the greatest gains on this task were the ones who \nwere asked to explain the reasoning behind either their own definition or the \ncorrect definition of the word. Explanation has been successful in developing \nchildren\u2019s understanding of number (e.g., Muldoon, et al., in press; Siegler, \n1995). The current findings support Brand\u00e3o and Oakhill\u2019s (2005) suggestion \nthat explanation could be used specifically to improve children\u2019s analysis of \ntext to answer comprehension questions and demonstrate that explanation \nmight be a useful tool for developing language and literacy skills. However, it \nwas notable that the group who received practice and feedback only also \nimproved the quality of their definitions during the course of the study. The \nanalysis of types of definition revealed that all groups shifted attention to the \ntext itself, although the explanation groups were more accurate in their use of \nthis information. Thus, although explanation may help to improve \nperformance, feedback (or even simply practice) also appears to be a \nfacilitator of change.  \nA subsidiary aim of this study was to explore in greater detail what \ndrives improvement in performance. The role of explanation will be \nconsidered first. In Siegler\u2019s (1995) study of number conservation, 5-year-olds \nwho were required to explain the correct answer provided by the adult made \nDeriving word meanings from context, 21 \n 21 \ngreater gains than children whose task was to explain their own response. \nProvision of the correct answer may have helped the children to consider \ndifferent strategies or ways of thinking to solve the problems. Similarly, \nchildren in the current study who were given the correct answer might have \nbeen prompted to consider another source of information for their own (often \nincorrect) response, such as the text itself or more accurate analysis of the text.  \nChildren who explained their own (often incorrect) response before \nfeedback made comparable gains in overall performance and showed a \nstronger tendency to use the story information accurately, relative to children \nwho explained the experimenter\u2019s response. Clearly, explanation was not \nsimply reinforcing poor strategies for deriving the meanings of the words in \nthis group. During the explanation process, these children may have \ncompared the information in the story with their own response and noticed a \nmismatch between the two. Fukkink (2005) noted that children did not \nroutinely evaluate the adequacy of their inferences in relation to context. \nExplanation may have guided them to do so. These children may then be \nmore likely to consider context more carefully and evaluate their response on \nsuccessive trials. In addition, explanation might have helped children to \nconsider or work out a strategy to find the solution rather than making a wild \nguess. It seems likely that the instruction to explain helped both groups of \nchildren to focus their attention on what the text actually said and how this \nrelated either to their own response or that given by the experimenter. In this \nway, it might help to develop some aspects of children\u2019s metalinguistic \nawareness, such as their ability to reflect upon the meaning of words in \nrelation to the context (Gombert, 1992).  \nDeriving word meanings from context, 22 \n 22 \nAnalysis of the explanations showed that the group who explained the \nexperimenter\u2019s response provided fewer story-based explanations than those \nwho explained their own response. One possibility, that this group had less \ninsight into how to derive the meanings, was mentioned above. Another \npossibility is that the quality of their explanations was limited because they \nwere not compelled to explain the superior reasoning of an adult. There was a \ntendency for this group to give \u2018because you\u2019re an adult\u2019 as their explanation \nfor \u201cHow do you think I worked out\u2026\u201d.  This type of explanation has not \nbeen reported in the previous literature although, as noted in the Method \nsection, it was apparent in pilot work for this project. Thus, the difference in \nthe quality of explanations produced by the two groups might simply \nindicate that one group had a \u2018fall-back\u2019 response.  \nPractice and\/or feedback may also facilitate skilled use of context. As \nstated earlier, the analysis of different types of definition revealed no \nevidence that the two explanation groups were increasingly likely to use the \nstory content than were the feedback only group: all groups produced \nincreasing numbers of story-related definitions during the course of the \nstudy. This result is surprising, because the two explanation groups obtained \nsignificantly higher word definition scores in the post-intervention test. \nHowever, the analysis of the story-related definitions included incorrect \nresponses. Explanation may have helped children to select the relevant and \nappropriate parts of the context to derive more accurate answers. \nRepeated sessions are known to maximise the likelihood that learning \nand change will take place (Miller & Coyle, 1999). The group who received \nfeedback only in the form of the correct response improved between the first \nand the post-intervention sessions in two ways: they increased the number of \nDeriving word meanings from context, 23 \n 23 \ncorrect and partially correct word definitions and also the number of story-\nbased definitions in total (whether or not they were correct). So, is practice \nalone sufficient to increase children\u2019s use of context to derive new word \nmeanings?  \nStudies of instruction in deriving meaning from context report \ncontradictory effects of practice. Kuhn and Stahl\u2019s (1998) concluded that \npractice-only and instruction treatments are equally successful; Fukkink and \nde Glopper (1998) found significant differences between practice-only and \ncontrol conditions in few of the studies in their meta-analysis. In the current \nwork, the \u2018control\u2019 group had both practice and feedback and made \nsubstantial gains on the task. Feedback with repeated practice may have \nprompted children to consider different ways to derive meanings, because of \nthe mismatch between derived and correct meaning. Again, these findings \nsuggest that an elaborate programme of instruction in how to derive word \nmeanings from context may not be necessary to facilitate this skill. However, \npractice alone may not bring about such rapid growth and learning. All \ngroups received feedback on the correctness of their response and all groups \nimproved their performance. Further work is needed to determine how \neffective feedback is for different age groups and on different tasks.  \nOne criticism of this work is that the task was not ecologically valid \nand, thus, the findings may not be applicable to the classroom in which \nchildren are not required to explain the meanings of several novel words with \nsupportive contexts on repeated trials. Repeated sessions was a crucial feature \nof the design to accelerate learning and enable the study of change. The \ndesign has the potential to provide insights into how change occurs and this \nstudy has obvious practical implications. Both feedback and explanation may \nDeriving word meanings from context, 24 \n 24 \nbe useful tools to develop children\u2019s awareness of appropriate strategies to \naid literacy skills. Literacy differs from counting or number conservation, \nbecause it a non-algorithmic domain, one in which no single strategy can \nguarantee success. For example, there were word definition trials in which the \nchild obtained their response from the story context, but did not select the \nappropriate information. Fukkink\u2019s (2005) work and this study demonstrates \nthat untrained children are able to engage in appropriate word derivation \nbehaviours, but that they do not do so consistently or effectively. This study \nshows that children\u2019s ability to derive word meanings from context improves \nwith a very short intervention. Practice and feedback (the control group) \nfacilitates performance and practice with explanation and feedback leads to \ngreater gains. We need to determine what forms of practice and intervention \nare required to maintain performance levels and lead to consistent use in \nindependent reading. In addition, a wider range of word types should be \nincluded in future work. Recent work has shown that children can \nsuccessfully acquire meanings of nouns and verbs from supportive contexts \n(Nash & Snowling, 2006), so it is likely that this method can generalise to \nother word types.  \nIn sum, this study found that explanation was a useful instructional \ntechnique that facilitated children\u2019s ability to derive word meanings from \ncontext. Further, the feedback only control group also improved their \nperformance. Both explanation and feedback may have worked by focusing \nchildren\u2019s attention on the process of meaning derivation, which may have \nenabled the child to their inferential skills and helping them to evaluate their \nresponse. Clearly there is a need to determine the role of feedback and the \nDeriving word meanings from context, 25 \n 25 \nefficacy of different types of explanation on the development of other aspects \nof literacy and to understand better how they facilitates children\u2019s learning.  \n \nDeriving word meanings from context, 26 \n 26 \nReferences \nAnderson, R.

Example of story  \n \nTed was being chased by a bull. As he was running away he looked over to \nthe other side of the field and spotted a bope. If he could get to the other side \nbefore the bull, he would be able to slip through to the next field. The bull \ncould not follow him there.  \n \nBope = a gap in a fence or hedge (2 points); a fence or hedge (1 point); a gap (1 \npoint).  \nClues: \u2018through to the next field\u2019 indicates a boundary such as a fence or \nhedge; \u2018slip through\u2019 and \u2018the bull could not follow him there\u2019 indicates a \nsmall gap \nDeriving word meanings from context, 32 \n 32 \n \nTable 2.
