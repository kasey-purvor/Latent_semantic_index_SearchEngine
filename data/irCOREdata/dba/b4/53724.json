However, it has always \nplayed some role in this field, particularly in the scrutiny and passage of legislation, \nand since the removal of hereditary Peers in 1999, some writers have argued that the \nHouse has become more assertive. This article examines the attitudes of Peers, \nincluding a comparison with the views of Members of Parliament, and draws a \nnumber of conclusions about the role of the upper House in relation to social policy. \n \n \nAcknowledgements \nThe authors are grateful for the support of the Nuffield Foundation for this research \nfrom the Small Grant Scheme (SGS\/34825). \n \nWord count \n5215 \n 3 \nFor many the House of Lords is an arcane and archaic institution, with its greatest \nrelevance to social policy in recent times having been as an exemplar of social \ninequality. However, in addition to its role as the ultimate court of legal appeal in the \nUnited Kingdom, the House has played a part in examining and revising legislation, \nproviding a forum for debate and deliberation on issues of current concern, and \nscrutinising government, including the European Union. At the same time, the powers \nof the Lords have been limited: the Parliament Act of 1911 removed its power to \ndelay or amend money bills; the Parliament Act of 1949 reduced its ability to delay \nnon-money bills to one parliamentary session; and since 1945 the Salisbury doctrine, \nor convention, has meant that the Lords does not defeat bills passed in the House of \nCommons that have been foreshadowed in the governing party\u2019s general election \nmanifesto. It is perhaps not surprising, therefore, that the House has barely figured in \nmost analyses of the processes of making and scrutinising social policy. \n \nSince 1997 there have, however, been a number of changes which make some \nreconsideration of the role of the House of Lords appropriate. Labour\u2019s reforms of the \nLords sought to make the upper chamber more representative and legitimate with the \nremoval of the bulk of hereditary Peers. Whilst there has been no consensus on further \nreform, the work of the \u2018transitional house\u2019 has led some to argue that the chamber \nhas already begun to develop a new and more assertive role (Russell, 2003; Howe, \n2007). There have also been suggestions from MPs that, as a result, the House of \nLords is now playing a more substantial role in the formulation and scrutiny of social \npolicy and legislation (Bochel and Defty, 2007a). In addition, the creation of the \nHouse of Lords Appointments Commission, which has responsibility for making \nrecommendations for non-party political Peers, has led to the appointment of a \n 4 \nnumber of people with backgrounds in social welfare and related areas. While the \nextent to which the background and subject expertise of Peers impacts upon the \nscrutiny of government policy and legislation remains unclear, a possible shift in the \ncomplexion of the Crossbench Peers has added another dimension to the scrutiny of \npolicy and legislation in the Lords. \n \nThis article therefore examines the views of members of the contemporary House of \nLords, drawing upon a series of face-to-face interviews to examine Peers\u2019 attitudes \ntowards a range of social policy issues. The research was designed to allow \ncomparisons between the views of Peers and those of MPs, and indeed of the wider \npopulation. If the House of Lords is becoming more assertive, then the extent of \nagreement within it, and between it and the House of Commons, on key issues may be \ncrucial to governments\u2019 ability to successfully deliver their legislative programmes. \nMoreover, the extent to which Peers\u2019 attitudes reflect public opinion may impact upon \nclaims that the non-elected upper House, is nevertheless, more \u2018democratic\u2019 than an \nelected house dominated by party (Putnam, 1999).  \n \nThe sample interviewed comprised seventy-eight Peers (10 per cent of the current \nHouse), balanced to reflect the political make-up of the Lords: 24 Labour Peers; 18 \nConservatives; 10 Liberal Democrats; 23 Crossbenchers and 3 Bishops. It was also \nbroadly representative of the upper chamber in a number of other ways: the bulk of \nthose interviewed were life Peers, but 11 per cent were elected hereditary Peers, a \ngroup which comprises 13 per cent of the House as a whole; they represented a \ndiverse range of parliamentary experience, including individuals who first entered the \nLords between 1971 and 2006; while eight of the Crossbench Peers interviewed (11 \n 5 \nper cent of the sample, and 6 per cent of the House as a whole) had been appointed \nsince 2001 by the House of Lords Appointments Commission. Women were over-\nrepresented in the sample at 34 per cent, compared to only 20 per cent for the House \nas a whole, while only 14 per cent of those interviewed had previously served as MPs, \ncompared with 24 per cent of the current House. \n \nThe \u2018transitional\u2019 House of Lords \nWhen New Labour entered government in 1997, in addition to substantive policies \ntheir proposals for \u2018modernisation\u2019 included aspects of policy making and the \nconstitution, one part of which was reform of the House of Commons and House of \nLords, with a commitment to making the upper chamber more \u2018democratic and \nrepresentative\u2019 (Labour Party, 1997: 32) and effective and legitimate (Cabinet Office, \n1998). In 1999 the bulk of the hereditary Peers were removed, leaving behind 92 \nelected by their peers. This resulted in a significant rebalancing of the strength of \nparties in the House of Lords, and in May 2005 Labour became, for the first time, the \nlargest party in the Lords, although still far short of an overall majority. In addition, \nthe House of Lords Appointments Commission (HOLAC) was created in 2000 to \nconsider nominations for non-party political appointments to the Lords and by the end \nof 2008 had been responsible for the creation of 49 new Crossbench Peers. The result \nof these reforms has been the creation of an upper chamber in which no party has an \noverall majority, and in which there is a significant body of non-party political Peers. \nAs at 1 July 2009 the Lords was composed of 196 Conservatives, 214 Labour, 71 \nLiberal Democrats, 201 Crossbenchers, 26 bishops and 14 \u2018others\u2019.   \n \n 6 \nDespite the lack of progress on further reform, there is evidence to suggest that the \n\u2018transitional\u2019 House of Lords has become more assertive and more willing to \nchallenge the government. Labour has continued to suffer significant and increasing \nnumbers of defeats on votes, with 108 defeats during the 1997-2001 Parliament, 245 \nin the 2001-2005 Parliament, and a further 136 between 2005 and 2008, compared to \n62 defeats in the House of Lords for the Conservatives in the longer 1992-1997 \nParliament (House of Commons Library, 2008), with Cowley, for example, claiming \nthat \u2018Of the two Houses\u2026 it was the Lords that was more of a block on the \ngovernment throughout the Blair Era\u2019 (2007: 31). Moreover, Russell and Sciara\u2019s \nresearch (2006b) has shown that around two-fifths of government defeats in the upper \nchamber are not reversed, and thus that there is considerable scope for the Lords to \nhave a significant impact upon legislation. This has led some, such as Russell (2003; \nRussell and Sciara, 2006a) and Howe (2007), to argue that the chamber has become a \nmore effective and powerful body, with not only no party being close to an overall \nmajority, but also the removal of the bulk of the hereditary Peers in itself enhancing \nthe Lords\u2019 belief in its own legitimacy, a view that was expressed by a large number \nof Peers in interviews. However, Peers also suggested a number of other explanations \nfor their assertiveness. Both Conservative and Labour Peers noted that the House was \nnow more assertive because there was a Labour Government in power and that, \ndespite the balance of the parties, attitudes in the House remained predominantly \nconservative; some suggested that Peers felt threatened by plans for further reform, \nand as a result were more prepared to attack the Government; many also stressed that \nthey were forced to make changes by the poor quality of legislation being sent up \nfrom the Commons. \n \n 7 \nThe House of Lords and social policy \nWhile there has recently been a growth in scholarship about the House of Lords, little \nresearch has yet focused upon the views or impact of the Lords on specific policy \nareas. As noted above, whilst the House has not generally been viewed as playing a \nsignificant role in relation to social policy, nevertheless in recent years it has been \nwilling to challenge the government on a wide range of topics, including many that \nhave been key elements of the government\u2019s reform agenda. Government defeats in \nthe House of Lords have included high profile issues such as university tuition fees \n(1998), foundation hospitals (2003) and ID cards (2006), and a range of other topics \nincluding social policy-related issues such as the age of consent for gay men (1998), \nthe abolition of community health councils (2001), the rights of unmarried couples to \nadopt (2002), the education of asylum seekers\u2019 children (2002), proposals to outlaw \nincitement to religious hatred (2005), buying extra \u2018qualifying years\u2019 for state \npensions (2007), offender management (2007), the detention and treatment of people \nwith mental health problems (2007), and the welfare of children passing through the \nimmigration system (2008). Whilst some of these defeats have later been reversed by \nthe House of Commons, in many instances they have stood or the government has \nmade concessions. \n \nThere have been other ways in which the role of the Lords appears to have been \nchanging, including an increase in the number of government bills that are being \nintroduced in the Lords, again including on social policy issues (Bochel and Defty, \n2007a). Around one-third of bills now start life in the Lords, including, for example, \nthe Mental Health Bill in the 2006\/7 session, which saw 6 defeats for the government \nand a total of 66 amendments made in the upper chamber. It is also the case that \n 8 \ndefeating the government in the division lobbies is often the last recourse for those \nwho seek to amend legislation or influence policy (Russell and Sciara, 2006b). Issues \nare commonly raised at early stages of legislation and are only pressed to a vote if \nministers refuse to reconsider their approach. Government concessions are therefore \nmuch more common than defeats, although given the range of bodies attempting to \nexert influence (these include the House of Commons as well as the House of Lords, \ninterest groups and the media) it can be difficult to definitively apportion change to \nparticular sources. Perhaps unsurprisingly therefore, Cowley (2005) and Bochel and \nDefty (2007a) have also found some evidence that the government\u2019s difficulties with \neach chamber were effectively reinforcing each other, so that significant potential or \nactual opposition in both chambers may have encouraged the government to make \nconcessions on its legislation, sometimes even before it is introduced. Taken together, \nthese developments suggest that the views of the House of Lords are now impacting \nsignificantly, both directly and indirectly, on government proposals and legislation.  \n \nThe apparent increase in attention paid by the Lords to social legislation in terms of \nvotes is, however, not yet mirrored in the scrutiny work of its select committees, in \nlarge part because the chamber\u2019s two longest standing committees focus on science \nand technology and the EU (although the latter does include the social dimensions of \nthe European Union), with the Commons select committees continuing to play the \nmajor role in scrutinising the work of government departments. \n \nFinally, it is often asserted that the House of Lords is influenced by the expertise of its \nmembers. This was a view frequently echoed by Peers in interviews, with several \nasserting that in many cases expertise was more important than party loyalty, and that \n 9 \na well-informed speech by a recognised expert in some cases is sufficient to carry a \ndebate irrespective of party positions. However, examples to support this are largely \nanecdotal, and in relation to social policy, the breadth and depth of expertise in the \nHouse perhaps remains open to question. \n \nPeers\u2019 attitudes to welfare policy \nAs noted above, it is often suggested that Peers are less constrained by Party and by \nthe Whips than are MPs, and are more likely to draw upon their personal experience \nand attitudes, and the views of their fellow Peers who they consider to be experts, \nwhen scrutinising policy and legislation. Consequently understanding Peers\u2019 attitudes \nmay be central to explaining behaviour in the House of Lords, and in attempting to \npredict the likely response of the House to future government social policy proposals \nand legislation. \n \nResearch on MPs\u2019 attitudes to welfare (Bochel and Defty, 2007a and 2007b) found \nsome evidence to support the view that there is an emerging consensus on approaches \nto welfare, with a general convergence in MPs\u2019 attitudes around the idea of a more \nselective and targeted approach to welfare provision, and support for a mixture of \npublic and private provision. However, the level of consensus around an active role \nfor the state in enabling people to lift themselves out of poverty was much more \nlimited among Peers than MPs, whilst at the same time there was greater support \namong Peers\u2019 than MPs for the opposing poles of a minimal safety-net or a re-\ndistributive role for the state (Table 1), in many respects closer to the political \npositions of the parties in House of Commons in the 1980s (Bochel, 1992; Taylor-\nGooby and Bochel, 1988). Sixty-five per cent of Conservative Peers believed that the \n 10 \nstate should provide only a minimum safety-net and\/or to support the extension of \nprivate provision, a view expressed by 84 per cent of Conservative MPs in the 1980s, \nbut only 54 per cent of Conservative MPs today. This group suggested, for example, \nthat the role of the state should be \u2018Minimal. The government is no good at running \neverything. The voluntary sector is better than the government and the private sector \nis better than the voluntary sector\u2019, and that \u2018The government should support those \nwho can\u2019t support themselves and the rest would prosper in a lower tax regime\u2019. \nAmong Labour Peers, 69 per cent believed that the state should provide universal \nprovision and\/or facilitate the redistribution of wealth, a position held by 85 per cent \nof Labour MPs in the 1980s, but only 51 per cent today. Many were unapologetic \nabout their views, with one noting, for example, \u2018I\u2019m not old Labour, I\u2019m primeval \nLabour\u2026 As a socialist I want to see good public services\u2019. There was also some \nsupport for redistribution among Liberal Democrats. \n \nTABLE 1.

You can\u2019t rely on the private sector\u2026 the profit motive means some \npeople won\u2019t be supported\u2019 (Conservative) and \u2018I am fully paid up to the idea of the \npublic and private sector\u2019 (Liberal Democrat). A number of Peers from all sides of the \nHouse explicitly recognised that their views had changed in recent years. \n \n 12 \nIn the past it was often argued that most Crossbenchers tended to sympathise and vote \nwith the Conservatives, and as a group they still tend to vote against Labour (Crewe, \n2005). However, it has been suggested that the Crossbenchers have, in recent years \nbecome a more diverse group, particularly since the creation of the House of Lords \nAppointments Commission, and in response to this question they did express the \nwidest range of views. The idea that there has been something of a shift on the \nCrossbenches was also supported by a number of those interviewed; and among the \neight Crossbenchers interviewed who had been appointed through HOLAC, views \nranged from support for a limited safety-net, similar to that expressed by many \nConservatives, to a rigorous redistribution of wealth, closer to the views expressed by \nsome Labour Peers. In general therefore, the evidence available tends to support the \nview that the removal of the hereditaries and the work of the Appointments \nCommission is indeed serving to create a more heterogeneous group of Peers.   \n \nFunding welfare \nWhere perceptions of how welfare services should be financed were concerned, again \nsignificant divisions appeared both across and within parties (Table 2). The \noverwhelming majority of Labour and Liberal Democrat Peers, and most \nCrossbenchers, plus a minority of Conservatives, believed that provision should be \nfinanced through general taxation and national insurance. However, substantial \nminorities in each grouping felt that whilst the state should take primary responsibility \nfor funding, individuals should take on more of the burden (\u2018We have reached the \nlimit of what is acceptable and sensible in terms of levels of taxation\u2019 (Liberal \nDemocrat); \u2018I don\u2019t think that you can get much more from the taxpayer\u2026 There is \ntherefore an obligation on families to do more\u2019 (Crossbencher)), and, reflecting more \n 13 \ngeneral beliefs, two-fifths of Conservative Peers argued that, beyond a basic safety-\nnet, individuals and their families should be responsible for supporting themselves \n(\u2018We should be encouraging self-reliance as a concept people should take on board\u2019). \n \nTABLE 2.

Whilst MPs from all parties showed some divergence from party policy \n 14 \non this point, the views of Peers were somewhat bolder and more polarised than their \ncolleagues in the Commons. Half of Labour and Liberal Democrat Peers advocated \nincreases in taxation to pay for increased provision (\u2018We need to make the argument \nfor tax increases. If we want valuable services we will need to pay for them\u2019 (Labour); \n\u2018Tax the super-rich more\u2019 (Liberal Democrat)), as did one-third of Crossbenchers, \nwhile, in contrast, one-third of Conservative Peers advocated making substantive tax \ncuts. \n \nChallenges and priorities \nWhen Peers were questioned about challenges to the welfare state there was again \nboth agreement and division across the party groups. Peers of all parties and \nCrossbenchers referred to the ageing population and the costs of welfare (in terms of \nrising costs, balancing costs against people\u2019s expectations, and the perceived pressure \nnot to increase taxes) as the main challenges, but Conservatives were more likely than \nothers to identify the need to avoid dependency and \u2018draw a line\u2019 in terms of the \nresponsibility of the state, so that \u2018The main challenges are the same as they\u2019ve \nalways been \u2013 identifying who has needs and targeting help towards them\u2019, whilst \ntheir Labour counterparts were more likely to talk about poverty and related issues \nsuch as affordable housing (\u2018\u2026if you read Polly Toynbee\u2019s book about living on the \nminimum wage you realise it\u2019s bad\u2019). A number of Crossbenchers strongly defended \nthe welfare state (\u2018The biggest challenge is its survival, this is a genuine fight\u2019), and \nsome New Labour policies (\u2018SureStart is brilliant and brave because we won\u2019t get the \nresults for twenty years, and it involves local communities\u2019), although others were \nless positive, frequently identifying problems of cost and poor value for money. \nAmong the Crossbenchers, and arguably representing a significant strand within the \n 15 \nHouse of Lords, one-fifth identified the criminal justice and penal systems as major \nchallenges facing the welfare state. This is in marked contrast to MPs\u2019 responses in \nwhich criminal justice was rarely mentioned in terms of social policy. \n \nAsked about priorities for additional spending, older people, children, the NHS and \neducation were the areas most commonly identified by Peers (Table 3). Again there \nwere significant divisions across parties, although the nature of these might not have \nbeen anticipated. Conservative Peers, for example, were the most likely to identify the \nNHS and education as priorities, and despite some of the views voiced by the Party \nleadership, by far the least likely to mention children or child poverty. Among Labour \nPeers children and older people came in front of traditional areas such as the NHS and \neducation, although that may have been because this group were aware of significant \nincreases in expenditure on those services since 1997. The views of Crossbenchers, \nand to a lesser extent their Liberal Democrat colleagues, were fairly evenly spread. \nInterestingly, while a number of Peers had identified the problems of the criminal \njustice and penal systems as significant challenges for the welfare state, only a small \nnumber said that these should be priorities for spending. \n \nTABLE 3.

For example, one \nthird of Labour Peers dismissed the idea of universalism and advocated a more \nselective targeted approach to welfare, whilst a quarter of Conservative Peers stressed \nthat the state had a duty to ensure that people were supported in a broad range of \nareas, even if it was not responsible for providing that support. In at least some cases, \nthis appears to represent a genuine shift in Peers\u2019 attitudes rather than generational \ndifferences. For example, one long-serving Labour Peer, who had served as an MP \nunder Harold Wilson, stated there was now \u2018no logic in universalism\u2019. Similarly, a \nConservative Peer ennobled by Margaret Thatcher, observed that \u2018the debate has \nmoved on from does the state have a role or not, to how do the state and the private \nsector work together?\u2019, whilst another expressed grave reservations about the quality \nof private sector provision and argued that \u2018the state should provide good quality \nservices across the board\u2019. \n \nThere was also a widespread view among many Peers from all parties and the \nCrossbenches that employment is important, and that it is better to get people into \n 17 \nwork, or keep them in work, than to support them on benefits (although there were \nfundamental differences of opinion in the best way to achieve this, with some \nConservatives emphasising the need to limit benefits and lower taxes to encourage \nemployment, whilst some Labour Peers stressed the importance of tax credits, and the \nminimum wage as a means of making work more attractive). This debate was \nsummarised by a Liberal Democrat Peer, and former MP, who observed that: \n \nThere is a consensus in terms of people agreeing on a big strategic level \nthat access to work is the best route out of poverty. This used to be a \nhighly contentious issue, because of the issue of conditionality. There is \nnow a large measure of consensus on an active labour market, but as soon \nas you get into implementation of strategy, you fall out with each other \nrather grandly.  \n \nSecondly, as in the Commons, there was strong support among Peers\u2019 from all parties \nfor a role for a mixture of providers in the delivery of services (Table 4). Whilst, as \nnoted earlier, there were differences of opinion over who should finance welfare \nservices, on the question of who should provide services there was a strong consensus \naround the idea of mixed provision by the public, private and not-for-profit sectors. \n \nTABLE 4. Peers\u2019 views on who should be responsible for providing welfare services, \n2007-08 (percentage of valid responses by group) \n Labour Conserva-\ntive \nLiberal \nDemocrat \nCross-\nbench \nTotal \nMainly the state 30 0 30 23 21 \n 18 \nA range of providers \nincluding state, private and \nnot-for-profit sectors \n35 56 40 68 51 \nThe public and private \nsector in partnership \n35 25 30 5 22 \nMainly the private sector 0 19 0 5 6 \nNumber 20 16 10 22 68 \n \n \nSubstantial majorities of both Labour and Conservative Peers stated that services \nshould either be provided by the public and private sector, or by a range of providers \nincluding the state, private and not-for-profit sectors. However, as in the Commons, a \nlarger proportion of Labour Peers stated that services should be provided by the \npublic and private sector in partnership, whilst a larger proportion of Conservative \nPeers identified a role for a wider range of providers including the voluntary and not-\nfor-profit sectors. This emphasis on mixed provision, which is also seen by some as a \nkey part of any \u2018new consensus\u2019 on approaches to welfare, appears to reflect in \nparticular a shift in the Labour Party\u2019s attitude to the private sector (Bochel and Defty, \n2007a). Labour Peers, like their counterparts in the Commons, were much less \nconcerned about the involvement of the private sector in the delivery of services than \nwere Labour MPs in the 1980s, none of whom saw a role for the private sector. Many \nLabour MPs and Peers now expressed themselves as \u2018relaxed\u2019 about the private \nsector, or no longer viewed the private sector as \u2018all bad\u2019. Indeed, the extent to which \nattitudes have shifted was indicated by one Labour Peer who observed that, contrary \nto current Labour Party thinking, he did not consider \u2018the public sector to be all bad, \nand the private sector all good\u2019. \n 19 \n \nPower without representation? \nInterestingly, a number of Peers argued that as they were less constrained by Party, \nand because the House was becoming more diverse, their attitudes more closely \nreflected those of the general public, and that in this respect the House was perhaps \nmore democratic and representative than the House of Commons. To some extent the \nsupport among significant proportions of Labour, Liberal Democrat and Crossbench \nPeers for a strong and redistributive welfare state would appear to fit well with \napparent public support for state welfare provision, at least when measured by surveys \nsuch as the British Social Attitudes series. Similarly, those Conservative Peers who \nadvocated more limited provision and a desire for cuts in taxation also reflect a \nhardening of public attitudes towards benefits recipients evident in recent surveys (for \nexample, Taylor-Gooby, 2004). \n \nHowever, although \u2018representation\u2019 in the House of Lords is a complex issue, there is \nlittle evidence to suggest that the House is becoming, either through its composition \nor its attitudes, more representative. Despite the government\u2019s intention to create a \nmore representative House, the Lords remains far from representative of the \npopulation in social terms: for example, only around 3 per cent of Peers are non-white \nwhile 20 per cent are female; the average age of members is 69; and the Sutton Trust \n(2005) found that 62 per cent of Peers had attended private schools. Moreover, when \nasked who, if anyone, they felt that they \u2018represented\u2019, whilst Peers claimed to \nrepresent or consult with a diverse range of interests including charities, trades unions, \nprofessional bodies, and local interests, around a quarter claimed that they did not \nrepresent anyone. Crucially, unlike MPs, members of the House of Lords do not have \n 20 \nto submit themselves for election and therefore do not have to translate their views \ninto an electoral platform to test the views of the public at the ballot box. They are \ntherefore able to voice positions which their elected colleagues in the House of \nCommons might fear to be electorally unpalatable, a point conceded by several Peers.  \n \nConclusions \nWhilst some of the work of Westminster, particularly that which goes on out of the \npublic eye, means that it remains unclear how the attitudes of Peers in particular, and \nto some extent the differences between MPs and Peers, impact upon the scrutiny of \nwelfare policies and legislation, it is possible to outline a number of observations \nabout the impact of the House of Lords on welfare policy. \n \nFirstly, there is a range of evidence that the \u2018transitional\u2019 House of Lords is, perhaps \nincreasingly, willing to challenge the government, particularly during the passage of \nbills, including major social policy legislation. This appears to be underpinned by a \nnumber of factors, including the chamber\u2019s perception of its own greater legitimacy, \nthe weakened position of the government, and the views of Peers on particular issues. \n \nSecondly, the relative lack of support for any particular approach to welfare, together \nwith the greater independence of Peers that arises from the weaker party discipline in \nthe upper chamber, may help to explain the frequency of government defeats in the \nHouse of Lords, including in the passage of social policy legislation. With a smaller \ncentre ground, and considerably greater opposition from the poles of the two major \nparties, there are likely to be fundamental differences in the attitudes of many Peers to \nthe direction of any government\u2019s reform agenda. Moreover, given the greater \n 21 \nimportance of the Liberal Democrats in holding something close to the balance of \npower in the Lords, the extent to which a significant proportion of Liberal Democrat \nPeers (and indeed many Crossbenchers) oppose the government\u2019s approach, suggests \nthat other attempts to pursue welfare reform, particularly with an emphasis on \nretrenchment and selectivity, are likely to meet continued opposition. \n \nThirdly, although the voting behaviour of Liberal Democrat Peers has suggested a \nshift in support away from Labour and towards the Conservatives, this may in large \npart simply have been a response to a weaker and less popular government, and the \nbehaviour of this group is likely to prove as problematic for a Conservative \ngovernment as for Labour; and, in relation to social policy at least, the attitudes of \nLiberal Democrat Peers appear to be considerably closer to their colleagues on the \nLabour benches, than to the Conservatives. Moreover, whilst in the past the \nConservatives have been able to rely upon the support of a significant proportion of \nCrossbench Peers, it seems that the Crossbenchers are now more heterogeneous, in \npart because of the removal of the bulk of the hereditaries, and in part as a result of \nthe appointments made by the House of Lords Appointment Commission, reducing \nthe likelihood of regular and solid support for the Conservatives from this group. The \nreality might now be that a government of any party may experience difficulties \ngetting major social policy legislation through the Lords, particularly if it is not \noutlined in its election manifesto and therefore covered by the Salisbury convention. \n 22 \nReferences \n \nBochel, H.
