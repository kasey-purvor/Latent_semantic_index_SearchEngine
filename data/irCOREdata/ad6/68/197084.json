Introduction \nThere is a now considerable body of literature focussing on the impact of corporate governance \nmechanisms on IPO (Initial Primary Offering) firm performance and underpricing.  However much of \nthis extent literature is devoted to the developed markets of US and Europe (see Gompers (1996) and \nGompers et al (2008)) with a lesser, though significant amount, directed towards developing countries.  \nThere is little, if any, focussing on Sub Saharan Africa, and in particular West Africa which makes an \nespecially interesting focus given considerable recent interest in these smaller frontier markets and \ntheir role in the promotion of sustainable domestic business finance and governance (Hearn and \nPiesse, 2010).  Equally there is considerable emphasis in the more recent literature on the optimal role \nof firm level governance in the wake of the global 2008\/2009 financial crisis and economic downturn \nand the role of institutions in facilitating optimal economic outcomes (Fosu et al. (2010); Kirkpatrick \n(2009); Claessens (2003)).  The West African region\u2019s markets are characterised by a divisive split in \naccordance to legal and institutional development with markets such as the integrated Francophone \nregional exchange of BRVM (Cote d\u2019Ivoire)1\n Study of the West African is motivated by countries within this region exhibiting sharp \ndifferences between civil code law institutions, imparted by former French or Portuguese colonial \nmetropole, and their common law counterparts, derived from former British colonial rule (Joireman, \n2001).  Equally owing to extractive nature of industrial development across the region with a \nprincipal focus of agricultural or mining commodities government apparatus and supportive \ncommercial legal institutions are narrow in focus in promoting the interests of powerful local social \nand political elites (Lavelle (2001); Hearn and Piesse (2009)).  However civil code law regimes by \ndesign are particularly vulnerable in the protection of property rights owing to their promotion of \ncentralised authority and property rights of the state in preference to those of individual minority \ninterests (Hayek, 1960).  Furthermore the emphasis of civil code legal regimes in following \u201cbright \n, Cameroon and Cape Verde Islands following a variant \nof French civil code law while Ghana and Nigeria adhere to English common law (La Porta et al \n(2008); Joireman (2001)).  In particular, given the considerable recent interest in these markets as a \nsource of sustainable development finance and in the attraction of foreign direct investment (FDI), \nthere has been a significant focus on improvements to the regions governance at a firm level.  \nConsequently I am motivated to ask whether there is a performance impact from IPO firms initiating \nimprovements in corporate governance that are in line with those prevailing in developed OECD \nmarkets. \n                                                 \n1 The Francophone West African Economic and Monetary Union (also known Union Mon\u00e9taire et \u00c9conomique \nde l\u2019Afrique de l\u2019Ouest (UMEAO)) countries include Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Benin, Togo, Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, \nSenegal and Guinea-Bissau \n 3 \nline rules\u201d (Levine, 2005) passed into legislative law by lawmakers that largely relegate judiciary to \nan administration role creates further structural impediments to the financial and economic innovation \nand development across the region (Joireman, 2001).  Furthermore a lack of supportive legal \nbureaucracy in civil code countries or a comprehensive body of supportive case law in common law \ncountries at independence together with their has hindered the ongoing development and evolution of \nlegal systems (Joireman, 2001) and enforced structural rigidities through the relative lack of property \nrights protection.  As a consequence of these differences the region is characterised by marked \ndifferences between largely French civil code institutional development centred on relationship and \nnetwork-based external finance and common law institutions emphasising markets-based \ndevelopment.  A further consequence of the relative differences in development of markets as well as \nthe emphasis placed on market-based economic reform by the international financial institutions that \nmany of the region\u2019s economies have followed in structural reform programs is that listings are \ncommonly made up from either larger former state owned enterprises (SOEs) or smaller family firms \ncentred on a principal owner-founder entrepreneur.  Consequently this provides a unique context to \nstudy the implicit effects of legal regime through its more indirect and pervasive influence on optimal \ngovernance mechanisms in the mitigation of informational asymmetry and protection of minority \ninvestor property rights. \nThe concept of underpricing in the flotation of new stock represents a direct wealth transfer \nfrom the founders and initial shareholders to new external investors (Filatotchev and Bishop, 2002) \nbut its extent can be significantly influenced by the extent of protection of property rights over a \nfinancial security\u2019s entitlements to corporate cash flows, whether these are enshrined in the prevailing \nlegal system (La Porta et al, 1998 henceforth LLSV), or through optimal corporate governance \nmechanisms (La Porta et al, 2000).  However while La Porta et al (1997) first characterised \ndifferences in ownership concentration across countries with those of civil code as opposed to \ncommon law being dominated by insiders with less dispersion LLSV found evidence across a sample \nof 49 countries that property rights and minority investors were best protected in common law \nsystems followed by Scandinavian and German civil codes and least in French civil systems.  As such \ncorporate governance is a set of mechanisms more concerned in the protection of outside investors \nfrom expropriation by corporate insiders (La Porta et al, 2000).  This has a number of implications in \nthe monitoring and surveillance of insiders with a unitary supervisory board structure composed of \nrepresentatives of major shareholders being favoured in civil code countries where legal protection of \nproperty rights is weaker, incentives to expropriate outsiders higher, and participation of minority \ninvestors discouraged (Jensen and Meckling (1976); La Porta et al, 1999; 2000).  Consequently \ngovernance practices such as split boards and separation of the roles of CEO and Chairman as well as \nmore diversified ownership are not common in civil code law countries in contrast to their common \nlaw counterparts (La Porta et al, 2000).  The civil code legal system engenders economic structural \n 4 \nrigidities where internal and relationship-based forms of finance and associated corporate governance \nsupersede external market-driven forms of finance and firm-governance structures of common law \ncountries (Levine, 2005).  The level of economic rigidity engendered by the legal institutions also \ninfers that market-determined outcomes to firm governance are at best unlikely (Levine, 2005) with \nownership structure being much less likely to adapt to pressures from investors searching for value \ngains as is the case in Germany (Kaserer and Moldenhauer, 2008).  As a consequence of these \nstructural rigidities and ownership characteristics Kaserer and Moldenhauer (2008) assert that the \nfirm performance-ownership relationship is likely to be less susceptible to endogeneity than in \ncommon law countries with legal institutions promoting external finance and well developed financial \nmarkets. \n The study of the performance effects arising from different corporate governance \nmechanisms such as the size of board of directors, itself a measure of the coordinative and \ncommunication ability of boards, instigation of board oversight audit, accounting and governance \ncommittees, separation of roles of Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chairman, and whether the \nfounder retains control in holding position of CEO provides some detailed insight into the mitigation \nof asymmetric information between principals (owners) and agents (incumbent managers).  \nExamination of firms undergoing IPOs is especially useful given this important milestone in the \nfirm\u2019s life cycle since its corporate governance is likely to be clearer at listing owing to compliance \nwith onerous regulation than at any other point in its history (Filatotchev and Wright, 2005).  Much of \ncorporate governance legislation and best practice guidelines emanates from developed OECD \nmarkets such as the UK\u2019s Cadbury Report, US Sarbanes-Oxley Act and South Africa\u2019s King II and III \nreports.  This is largely explicitly focussed on the optimal division of roles and the enhanced \ncommunication between different entities in order to create a universally recognized set of standards \nthat are adhered to by all parties (Jensen and Meckling (1976); Fama and Jensen (1983); Kalbers and \nFogarty (1998)).  However while this legislation has been generally adopted as best practice world-\nwide it\u2019s institutional origins are those of generally economically developed Western economies \ndominated by democratic institutions with a generally level political and legal institutions providing \nprotection of property rights (Levine (2005); La Porta et al (2008)).  These underlying assumptions \nconcerning the social and political structure of the societal matrix in West African countries are at \nbest tenuous given the prevalence of narrow political economies (Lavelle (2001); Hearn and Piesse \n(2009)) owing to their having inherited a narrow range of institutions from colonial metropoles that \nare geared to the engendering of political and social elites (Joireman (2001, 2005)).  However the \ncivil code institutional environment engenders collaborative networks between firms due to the \nrelative weakness in legal contract enforcement (Hoskisson et al, 2004) which fits effectively within \nthe deeper West African societal institutional matrix, itself shaped by traditional values and \naffiliations.  This in turn infers that the business environment is shaped largely by relationship or \n 5 \nnetwork based affiliations between investors, agents and market participants which mitigates \ntransactions costs with only those larger better capitalized and internationally focussed firms able to \ncomply with international corporate governance best practice as a way of attracting valuable foreign \ninvestment. \n The previous literature regarding the impact of corporate governance mechanisms such as the \nretention of the founder as CEO, board size, establishment of independent committees and separation \nof roles of CEO and chairman have principally focussed on the signalling of quality arising from the \nimplementation of these mechanisms to potential IPO investors.  Firms where the founder-\nentrepreneur retains a controlling role as CEO following an IPO are likely to be subject to greater \nscrutiny by investors given the high private benefits of control and questionable legal enforcement in \nmarkets characterised by weaker legal protection of property rights (Levine (2005); Brennan and \nFranks (1997)).  This leads to higher agency costs as entrepreneur-founders are likely to be more \nreluctant to disclose proprietary information to potential IPO outside investors (Shane and Cable, \n2002) while founders are also more likely to engage in opportunistic actions for personal gratification \nsuch as tunnelling at the expense of outside shareholders (Jensen and Meckling, 1976).  One way to \nmitigate these issues is for founders to initiate costly governance mechanisms that would be too \nexpensive to replicate in all but the highest quality firm\u2019s thereby effectively signalling quality to \noutside investors (Downes and Heinkel, 1982).  One such mechanism is for founders to retain a \nsignificant portion of ownership (Leland and Pyle, 1997).  A similar reasoning applies to director \nlevel retained ownership with directors themselves as corporate insiders being able to signal the \nquality of their firm through high levels of retained ownership.  Consequently I conjecture that in line \nwith previous findings in the literature (Bruton et al, 2009) that there is a curvilinear (U-shaped) \nrelationship between underpricing and retained ownership by founders and directors.  As such \nunderpricing first decreases before subsequently increasing with rising ownership.  However the \ncontinued presence of the founder as CEO following IPO will be perceived negatively by potential \ninvestors at IPO and as such I conjecture it will be positively related to higher levels of underpricing.  \nThe board of directors itself can be viewed as a tool that is useful in mitigating asymmetric \ninformation with larger boards being more dispersed and incurring greater coordination costs than \nsmaller counterparts where communication is engendered.  As such I conjecture that increases in \nboard size will be positively related to increases in underpricing reflecting this asymmetric \ninformation cost from poorer coordination.  Following this reasoning there is a considerable literature \ndetailing the beneficial impact on the reduction of asymmetric information from formal separation of \nthe roles of CEO and Chairman underlying the necessity of having a truly independent set of directors \nin a monitoring capacity able to challenge inefficient decisions by executive directors and incumbent \nmanagement (Fama (1980); Fama and Jensen (1983); Shleifer and Vishny (1997)).  Consequently I \nconjecture that separation of the roles of CEO and Chairman will lead to a reduction in underpricing, \n 6 \ni.e. a negative relationship with asymmetric information.  The creation and establishment of \nindependent board committee\u2019s is an expensive process for many firms and while this can be seen as \na form of signalling quality to potential outside investors (Downes and Heinkel, 1982) there is a lack \nof consensus in the literature regarding their beneficial impact over and above the oversight role \nundertaken by truly independent directors themselves (Anderson and Reeb (2004); Golden and Zajac \n(2001)).  However despite the debate and subsequent lack of consensus in literature regarding the \nbeneficial role of committees, and in particular board level audit committees, the highly relationship-\nbased business environment of West Africa (Lavelle, 2001) will likely exacerbate the findings of \nTurley et al (2004) who find that the formation and reliance of firms on independent audit committees \nactually cause net increases in agency and monitoring costs.  However despite these concerns \nregarding the mixed evidence over the establishment and true level of independence of board \ncommittees I conjecture that the establishment of board committees as a governance device should \nhave a negative relationship with underpricing in reducing asymmetric information. \n These conjectures lead to the formulation of the following hypotheses with respect to the \nimpact of governance measures on firm performance and the determinants of director and founder \nretained ownership.  The relationship between increasing retained director ownership and \nunderpricing should be curvilinear (U-shaped) (H1.2) while that for founder-entrepreneur retained \nownership and underpricing is inverted curvilinear (inverted U-shaped) (H1.2).  Levels of \nunderpricing are positively associated with board size, founder ceding CEO position, and the \nseparation of roles of CEO and Chairman and negatively associated with establishment of committees \n(H2.2, 2.4, 2.6, 2.8).  Firm\u2019s market value is positively associated board size, establishment of \ncommittees, and negatively associated with founder ceding CEO role and separation of roles of CEO \nand Chairman (H2.1, 2.2, 2.5, 2.7).  Firms that instigate separation of the roles of CEO and Chairman \nare less likely to have founder retaining CEO position while being more likely to have larger boards \nand higher levels of board independence (H3.1 to H3.3).  Similarly firms establishing committees are \nless likely to be associated with founder retaining CEO position, more likely to be associated with \nlarger boards and equally less likely to be associated with board independence (H3.4 to H3.6).  Given \nthe serious potential issues of CEO and insider dominance of board and the moral hazard arising a \npotential costly method for higher quality firms to signal their quality is for CEO and directors to \nretain ownership following IPO.  As such CEO retained ownership should be negatively associated \nCEO equals Chairman and board size while being positively associated with establishment of \ncommittees and founder retaining CEO role (H4.1 to H4.4).  Equally director ownership should be \nnegatively associated with CEO equals Chairman while being positively associated with committee \nestablishment, founder being CEO and board size (H4.5 to H4.8).  However given concerns over \nmanagerial entrenchment and high private benefits of control prevail retained director ownership \nshould be positively associated with underpricing (H4.9). \n 7 \n I find evidence that only some of the standard governance measures are effective in reducing \nunderpricing and mitigating asymmetric information.  Notably separation of CEO-Chairman duality \nand founder ceding CEO position have a beneficial impact on underpricing while the increased \ncoordination and communication issues associated with larger boards has a negative impact.  The \nestablishment of committees empowered with independent oversight of directors and incumbent \nmanagement which is a cornerstone of international governance best practice actually has a \ndetrimental impact on underpricing.  Levels of CEO and director retained ownership are more \ndetermined on the basis of the separation of CEO and Chairman roles and the founder ceding CEO \nposition, while retained director ownership has a detrimental impact from increasing underpricing.  \nHowever there is some evidence that very high levels of retained ownership by founder-entrepreneurs \nleads to a decrease in underpricing which would infer a different optimal governance mechanism \ncentred on their being corporate block-shareholders that are best placed to protect minority investor \nproperty rights in the absence of effective legal system. \n This paper is structured as follows:  The next section introduces the data while section 3 \noutlines the methodology in detailing the three respective dependent firm performance variables, \nnamely firm value and underpricing as well as the hypotheses.  Section 4 provides the empirical \nresults while the final section concludes. \n \n2.  Data \n2.1.  Sample \nComprehensive lists of IPO\u2019s and listings were obtained direct from the national exchanges of Cape \nVerde Islands (Bolsa de Valores de Cabo Verde), Cameroon (Bourse de Douala), BRVM (Cote \nd\u2019Ivoire), Ghana for the period 2000 to 2009.  Nigerian lists were only available from 2002 to 2009.  \nThese were cross checked with national stock exchange websites and from similar lists obtained from \nmajor brokerage houses to ensure accuracy in the case of Nigeria.  This resulted in a list of 100 \nlistings having taken place across the region during the period 2000 to 2009.  Flotation prospectuses \nwere then hand-collected from the Ghana stock exchange and Bolsa de Valores de Cabo Verde (Cape \nVerde Islands exchange) and from the stock exchange website for the Bourse de Douala (Cameroon \nexchange) while the Thomson Corporation Perfect Information were used to source Nigerian \nprospectuses.  This resulted in the procurement of 66 listing prospectuses amounting to all listings in \nCape Verde, 4 out of 8 listings in BRVM, 16 out of 18 listings in Ghana, 1 out of 3 listings in \nCameroon and finally 29 out of 67 listings in Nigeria. \nI then exclude readmissions and transfers of listings between main and development boards \nwhile also excluding demergers, reorganizations and flotation of preferred stock, convertibles, unit \nand investment trusts.  Consequently the list of valid IPO prospectuses was reduced to the current \nsample size of 37 IPO firms.  These floated ordinary shares with single class voting rights.  Share \n 8 \nprices were obtained from Bloomberg, DataStream and direct from the national stock exchange in \nCape Verde and Cameroon.  US$ Exchanges rates were obtained from Bloomberg.  The classification \nof each market according to its legal origin was made using La Porta et al (2008). \n \n2.2.  West African securities markets \nThere are considerable differences between West Africa\u2019s stock markets with the greatest of these \nbeing between markets adhering to common as opposed to civil code commercial and regulatory law.  \nHowever all markets are characterised by narrow political economies controlled by social and \npolitical elites (Lavelle (2001); Hearn and Piesse (2009)) and only a handful of brokerage firms and \nindigenous investment banks with minimal trading activity.  The lack of an established domestic \ninstitutional investor community in many of the markets combined with poor infrastructure create \nfurther difficulties in attracting much needed foreign investment (Hearn and Piesse (2009)).  An \nadditional issue arises from trading activity occurring outside the formal exchanges with only the pre-\nagreed details being acknowledged during designated trading sessions as is the case in Ghana (Akotey, \n2008). \n The evidence in Table 1 detailing the sample structure reveals the more sporadic nature of \nlistings across the region.  Listings activity on the BRVM acting as the West African Francophone \nregional exchange is largely static during the sample period with notable exceptions being Onatel, the \nBurkina Faso telecommunications operator, two Bank of Africa affiliates from Niger and Benin, and \na local Ivorienne firm.  This regional focus to the listings on the otherwise inactive market (Lavelle, \n2001) is largely the result of political pressure and a marketing drive designed to enhance the regional \nfocus of the market (Hearn and Piesse, 2010).  It is also facilitated in practice by the extended \nregional network of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Gestion et d'Intermediation (SGIs) in each member state of the Union \nEconomique et Mon\u00e9taire Ouest Africaine (UEMOA) who act as Chef de File (Lead Manager and \nunderwriter) in flotations.  The Cameroonian Bourse de Douala has been similarly inactive during its \nhistory since inception in 2003 and only attracted its first listings in 2008 (DSX website, 2010) while \nthe Cape Verde Islands exchange has had greater success despite the very small size of the Islands \neconomy in attracting four listings since its establishment in 2005 (BVC website, 2010).  All three of \nthe smaller illiquid civil code exchanges operate sophisticated electronic call auctions in order to \nachieve the greatest informational efficiency and have small brokerage communities dominated by \nthe affiliate arms of major French, and Portuguese in case of Cape Verde, banks (Hearn and Piesse, \n2010).  There are substantially more IPOs in the case of the two common law markets, namely Ghana \nand Nigeria, although the majority of these firms notably have head office locations in the immediate \nvicinity of the exchange itself providing further indication of the narrow formal economy in each case.  \nA greater proportion of IPOs in Ghana than in Nigeria are made up from privatizations of government \nand state agency ownership stakes in former state owned enterprises (SOEs) while the listing of \n 9 \nGambia\u2019s Trust Bank on the Ghanaian exchange is a rare example of politically motivated listing \nbetween smaller common law West African markets. \n \nTable 1 \n \n3.  Methodology \nThis study is focussed on the performance effects of IPO firms from a variety of corporate \ngovernance mechanisms, namely separation of roles of CEO and Chairman, establishment of \nindependent committees, board size and retention of founder-entrepreneur as CEO.  As such the first \nsection details the effects of increases in founder-entrepreneur and director (insider) ownership and \nlevels of underpricing.  Subsequent sections then focus on the impact of various governance \nmechanisms on firm value, underpricing at both 2 weeks and 180 days.  A final analysis is made of \nthe determinants of IPO firms implementing the governance mechanisms of board committees and \nseparating the roles of CEO and Chairman.  A major consideration with such a small dataset of 37 \nIPO firms is the effect of small sample bias on the statistical inference of models used.  Attempts to \nmitigate these concerns centre on the employment of panel OLS models that draw statistical strength \nfrom both time series and cross sectional elements as well as the use of a smaller number of \nindependent variables in line with recommendations in Good and Hardin (2009).  The reduction in the \nnumber of independent variables is even more important owing to the presence of missing data in \nsome of the IPO firms causing a further reduction in sample size actually employed in models.  \nConsequently the effects of small sample bias should be taken into consideration when interpreting \nthe results. \n \n3.1.  Firm value \nThe measure of firm value used is the natural logarithm of the ratio of the market value of equity on \nthe 14th trading day (specifically the market price at the close of the fourteenth trading day multiplied \nby the total number of shares outstanding) and the firm\u2019s revenues at the IPO year.  This is in line \nwith Shenone (2004) and is similar to that employed in Purnanandam and Swaminathan (2003) where \nit is argued that measures such as Tobin\u2019s Q and common stock price multiples such as price-to-\nearnings ratio and market-to-book value of equity, are noisy measures of firm value for IPOs.  An \nadditional issue regarding the use of stock price multiples is the common occurrence of negative \nvalues (Shenone, 2004) which the natural logarithm of the ratio of market value on 14th day to \nrevenues avoids.  The metric can also be represented as: \n \n\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8eb\n=\nyearIPOatvenues\ndaytradingthatValueMarketValuei Re\n14log     (1) \n 10 \n \n3.2.  Underpricing \nInitial returns are used as a measure of underpricing.  Two variants are used, namely that in 2 weeks \nand then 180 days following listing on exchange.  This is due to concerns over the severity of \nilliquidity in West Africa\u2019s equity markets causing price-rigidity (Smith (2005); Hearn and Piesse \n(2010)) that in turn would inhibit the movement of prices in relation to their ability to reflect order \nflow and information (O\u2019Hara, 2003).  In line with Filatotchev and Bishop (2002) underpricing is \ncalculated as the difference between stock price at 2 weeks (or 180 days) and the issue price divided \nby the issue price: \n \n[ ] iiii IssueIssuegCloIR \u2212= sin      (2) \n \n3.3.  Relationship between Director and Founder retained ownership and underpricing \nWhile an IPO as a single event in the corporate life cycle of firms represents a direct transfer of \nwealth from initial investors and entrepreneur-founders to outside investors (Daily et al (2003); \nBruton et al (2009)) the founders and early stage investors ownership is usually determined by lock-\nup agreements preventing sale of shares for a fixed period of time following the listing (Bruton et al, \n2009).  However there is evidence that large amounts of stock released after the IPO as covenants of \nthe lock-up agreement are waived (Brav and Gompers, 2003) inferring that founders are particularly \nkeen to retain ownership in high quality ventures.  This is a particularly prevalent signal of quality \ngiven the founder-entrepreneur is foregoing opportunities to diversify his\/her portfolio in order to \nretain significant levels of ownership in the firm (Jensen and Meckling, 1976).  However while \nsignalling theory provides an indication of the beneficial impact from retained ownership by founders \nand early stage corporate insiders (directors) that reduces underpricing this effect may be limited \n(Bruton et al, 2000).  At this stage there are considerable differences in the literature relating to the \ndifferent types of corporate insider i.e. directors and founders.  The literature relating to the former \nwould indicate that as their ownership levels increase there may be a mal-alignment of incentives \nwith increasing ownership leading to increasing levels of control and significantly greater potential \nfor opportunistic behaviour due to higher private benefits of control (Busenitz et al, 2005).  Bruton et \nal (2009) find evidence of a trade off effect between incentive alignment and entrenchment effects \nassociated with higher levels of insider ownership and provided evidence of a nonlinear relationship \nbetween insider ownership and underpricing.  This curvilinear U-shaped curve delineated the trade-\noff between increased insider efficiency and levels of asymmetric information arising from moral \nhazard problems.  Consequently I test the following hypothesis: \n \n 11 \nH-1.1:  There is a curvilinear (U-shaped) relationship between underpricing and retained (post-IPO) \nownership by the directors acting in their capacity as corporate insiders.  Underpricing first decreases \nand then increases with an increase in their ownership. \n \nHowever the evidence from Bruton et al (2009) and Busenitz et al (2005) was from US and UK \nmarkets.  Evidence to the contrary in emerging markets was found by Bouton et al (2009) who \npresented empirical evidence for the benefits of high levels of insider block-shareholder ownership in \nlegal regimes characterised by poor protection of property rights and minority investors across a \ncomprehensive sample of global IPOs.  Furthermore in the context of the very weak legal \nenvironments and low levels of protection of property rights afforded in West African markets the \nincreased ownership of founder-entrepreneurs is likely to cause a reduction in underpricing as at high \nlevels of shareholding founders effectively become insider block-shareholders thereby providing an \neffective governance counter against the potentially detrimental effects of poor external legal \nprotection.  Consequently I test the following hypothesis: \n \nH-1.2:  There is a curvilinear (inverted U-shaped) relationship between underpricing and retained \n(post-IPO) ownership by the founders acting in their capacity as corporate insiders.  Underpricing \nfirst increases and then decreases with an increase in their ownership. \n \n3.4.  Board governance effects on IPO firm performance \nThe mainstream international corporate governance literature views an IPO as being the first major \n\u201cliquidity event\u201d in the life cycle of fast growing firms when founders and initial investors (corporate \ninsiders) begin the process of realizing the value of their ownership stake in the firm (Brav and \nGompers, 2003).  However the IPO process introduces a number of potential agency conflicts for the \nvarious principal and agent parties involved (Bruton et al, 2009).  Adverse selection and moral hazard \nproblems arise from the asymmetric information between new owners (investors) and incumbent \nmanagers (agents) as there are incentives for the latter to mislead or even worse expropriate the \nformer (Bruton et al (2009); Boulton et al (2009)).  As such the board of directors itself can be viewed \nas being a tool which can act to better align incentives of various principals and agents and facilitate \ncommunication and information disclosure thereby reducing asymmetric information (Jensen and \nMeckling, 1976).  The literature regarding the impact of board size on firm performance is largely \nderived from Jensen (1993) where smaller boards were argued to be the result of technological and \norganizational change that facilitates reduction of costs and corporate downsizing.  Hermalin and \nWeisbach (2003) found evidence suggesting that smaller boards are more effective than large boards \nas agency costs increase owing to a greater number of board members adopting the role of free-riders.  \nJensen (1993) found further evidence for the lack of cohesiveness in large boards leading to a lack of \n 12 \ncoordination and communication that reduced the effectiveness of the board as a monitoring tool in \nthe reduction of agency costs.  As such I conjecture that larger boards to be in larger firms with higher \nvalue and incurring higher levels of underpricing and cost of equity.  Consequently I test the \nfollowing hypotheses: \n \nH-2.1:  Board size is positively associated with IPO-firm value \n \nH-2.2:  Board size is positively associated with IPO-firm underpricing \n \nThe literature regarding the impact of the founder-entrepreneur retaining a controlling presence as the \nfirm\u2019s CEO on firm performance is largely centred around the fears of outside investors regarding \nhigh private benefits of control (Busenitz et al, 2005), a mis-alignment of incentives (Roosenboom \nand Schramade, 2006), propensity for expropriation and tunnelling, and significantly higher agency \ncosts (Bruton et al, 2009).  However given West African listings are made up primarily from either \nformer state owned enterprises or small and medium enterprises, of which many are entrepreneurial \nwith founders, I conjecture that founder retaining CEO role is more likely to be associated with \nsmaller firms of low value while underpricing and cost of equity should be higher.  As such I test the \nfollowing hypotheses: \n \nH-2.3:  Founder retains CEO role is negatively associated with IPO-firm value \n \nH-2.4:  Founder retains CEO role is positively associated with IPO-firm underpricing \n \nThe literature regarding the beneficial impact arising from firms establishing independent board level \ncommittees to oversee effective information disclosure, executive remuneration and monitoring is \nmore diffuse in its findings.  Daily (1995) and Dalton et al (1998) detail how the majority of corporate \ndecision-making is not undertaken through the committees but rather by the board itself while \nShivdasani and Yermack (1999) question the independence of committees from CEO control.  \nHowever given that the establishment of committees with at least nominal independence is a costly \nprocess for firms and is recommended in best practice governance guidelines in OECD and Cadbury \nReport I conjecture that the signalling of quality role of committee establishment will reduce \nunderpricing and costs of equity while being associated with better capitalized, larger value firms that \nare able to implement these costly procedures.  Consequently I test the following hypotheses: \n \nH-2.5:  Establishment of committee(s) is positively associated with IPO-firm value \n \n 13 \nH-2.6:  Establishment of committee(s) is negatively associated with IPO-firm underpricing \n \nCEO duality with the role of Chairman has been critically appraised in the literature with a \nconsiderable consensus citing that role duality serious impedes the independent monitoring capacity \nof boards (Fama (1980); Fama and Jensen (1983)).  Consequently I conjecture that role duality is \nmore likely in smaller lower value firms and will be more likely associated with higher levels of \nunderpricing and cost of equity.  Consequently I test the following hypotheses: \n \nH-2.7:  Separation of CEO-Chairman roles is negatively associated with IPO-firm value \n \nH-2.8:  Separation of CEO-Chairman roles is positively associated with IPO-firm underpricing \n \nOLS regressions were used to test these hypotheses using unbalanced panels.  This takes the form: \n \niiFirm\niLegalGovernancei\nControlsFirm\nControlsLegalGovernancetConsePerformanc\n\u03b5\u03b2\n\u03b2\u03b2\n++\n++= tan\n  (6) \n \nwhere performance is dependent variable relating to firm value and underpricing (both 2 weeks and \n180 days) respectively as defined in sections 3.1 to 3.2.  Committee, CEO equals Chairman and \nFounder equals CEO are dichotomous pulse dummy variables taking value 1 if condition is satisfied \nand 0 otherwise.  Board size is the total number of both executive and non-executive directors and is \ntaken to include those \u201cexecutive directors\u201d in civil code markets where boards are unitary in \nstructure and supervisory in function. \nLegal control variables are introduced as a dichotomous pulse dummy variables, taking value \n1 if the market adheres to civil code law and 0 otherwise, where a comprehensive list of civil and \ncommon law countries is provided in La Porta et al (2008).  Log contract enforcement is the natural \nlogarithm of the number of days taken in judicial process for contract resolution which is detailed in \nWorld Bank (2005). \nWhere governance represents each of the parameters indicated in the hypotheses and Firm \nand IPO controls are introduced from the literature.  Firm-level controls used in each case include \nfirm size, the natural logarithm of tangible assets as expressed in US$ (Filatotchev and Bishop (2002); \nFilatotchev et al (2005)).  Equally given debt may have a governance role limiting the level of \nmanagerial discretion and mitigating potential agency conflicts (Bruton et al, 2009).  As such I \ncontrol for possible effects of debt on IPO valuations in using the total debt-to-total asset ratio.  Given \nthe inclusion of a very wide variety of firms undergoing IPOs ranging from the privatizations of very \nlarge former state owned enterprises to smaller high growth technology companies with considerable \n 14 \nvariation in revenues this is controlled for by the natural logarithm of US$ converted revenues in IPO \nyear.   \n \n3.6.  Determinants of firms establishing committees and initiating separation of CEO-Chairman \nrole \nI study the determinants of firms initiating the corporate governance mechanisms of splitting the CEO \nand Chairman roles and establishing committees. \n The extent literature regarding the splitting of the CEO and Chairman roles infers that this is \nless likely in smaller firms which are themselves more likely to have founders retaining control as \nCEO themselves.  It is also more likely in larger firms with larger boards and greater level of board \nindependence.  As such I test the following hypotheses: \n \nH-3.1:  Splitting of the CEO-Chairman role is more likely to be negatively associated with the \nfounder retaining control in role of CEO. \n \nH-3.2:  Splitting of the CEO-Chairman role is more likely to be positively associated with larger \nboards. \n \nH-3.3:  Splitting of the CEO-Chairman role is more likely to be positively associated with higher \ndegree of board independence. \n \n The literature regarding the establishment of committees would infer that these are more \nlikely to be established in larger firms with larger boards which by virtue of size are less likely to \nhave founders retaining controlling position as CEO.  However the relationship of committee \nestablishment and levels of board independence is much less clear given the inconclusive literature in \nthis area.   \n \nH-3.4:  The establishment of committees is more likely to be negatively associated with the founder \nretaining control in role of CEO. \n \nH-3.5:  Splitting of the CEO-Chairman role is more likely to be positively associated with larger \nboards. \n \nH-3.6:  Splitting of the CEO-Chairman role is more likely to be negatively associated with higher \ndegree of board independence. \n \n 15 \nThese hypotheses are tested using logistic (Logit) regressions with dichotomous dependent variable \ntaking the value of 1 for those firms that have either established committees or in a second model \nhave split the roles of CEO and Chairman and 0 otherwise.  The Logit regression is of the form: \n \niControlsFirm\niLegalVariablesi\nControlsFirm\nControlsLegalVariablessticCharacteritConsDependent\n\u03b5\u03b2\n\u03b2\u03b2\n++\n++= tan\n (7) \n \nWhile Founder equals CEO and Board size have been defined in previous section board independence \nis introduced and measures the proportion of non-executive to executive directors.  Together these \nthree variables form the characteristic variables in model.  Firm controls are defined in previous \nsections. \n \n3.7.  Determinants and effects of CEO and Director-shareholder retained ownership \nThe role of CEO and director\u2019s retained ownership post-IPO are argued to have a major beneficial \nimpact on firm governance especially in countries with weaker levels of investor protection such as \nthose adhering to civil code law as opposed to common law (Boulton et al, 2009).  This is especially \ntrue in terms of signalling quality given both types of shareholder forfeit opportunities to diversify \nportfolios in order to maintain costly ownership in their own firm thereby signalling quality to \npotential outside investors.  As a consequence of the differences in legal regime and inferred \nprotection of property rights there are likely to be significant differences in ownership between civil \nand common law regimes (La Porta et al, 2008). \n As such increased CEO shareholding will be more likely to be associated with governance \nenhancing measure of committee establishment and a split in the roles of CEO and Chairman while \nbeing negatively associated with board size.  However it is also highly likely associated with founder \nretaining role of CEO as in line with Boulton et al (2009) the founder is also likely to be the dominant \ncorporate insider block-shareholder in SME firms.  As such I test the following hypotheses: \n \nH-4.1:  CEO retained ownership is negatively associated with CEO equals Chairman \n \nH-4.2:  CEO retained ownership is positively associated with establishment of committee(s) \n \nH-4.3:  CEO retained ownership is positively associated with Founder equals CEO \n \nH-4.4:  CEO retained ownership is negatively associated with board size \n \n 16 \nDirector-level shareholding is more diffuse in nature and less focussed on the motivations of a single \nindividual.  However this will be more likely to be negatively associated with duality in the CEO-\nChairman role while being positively associated with the establishment of committees.  The \nrelationship with the founder retaining CEO role is less clear although this is likely to be a positive \nassociation given the founder is likely to fill director posts with family members and exert pervasive \ndominance over board affairs and hence concentrated insider ownership.  Director retained \nshareholding is also likely to be positively associated with board size given the strength of incentives \nfor insider corporate block-shareholder ownership (Boulton et al, 2009).  As such I test the following \nhypotheses: \n \nH-4.5:  Director retained ownership is negatively associated with CEO equals Chairman \n \nH-4.6:  Director retained ownership is positively associated with establishment of committee(s) \n \nH-4.7:  Director retained ownership is positively associated with Founder equals CEO \n \nH-4.8:  Director retained ownership is positively associated with board size \n \nOLS regressions were used to test these hypotheses using unbalanced panels.  This takes the form: \n \niiIPO\nControlsFirmVariablesi\nControlsIPO\nControlsFirmVariablestConsOwnership\n\u03b5\u03b2\n\u03b2\u03b2\n++\n++= tan\n  (8) \n \nwhere Ownership is percentage retained ownership by CEO in first model and directors in second \nmodel post-IPO.  Characteristic, Firm and Legal control variables are defined in sections 3.1 to 3.3. \n \nHowever a higher level of ownership by insiders, and in particular directors, is likely to be reflected \nin levels of underpricing.  The literature is divided over this issue with Boulton et al (2009) citing \nconsiderable evidence for the beneficial monitoring role of corporate insider block-shareholders in \npoorly protected and enforced legal regimes while Jensen and Meckling (1976) and Fama (1980) cite \nthat enhanced ownership and control by directors is potentially detrimental to firm value and \nincreases moral hazard and asymmetric information.  Consequently I conjecture that higher levels of \ndirector level ownership have a positive impact on underpricing.  As such I test the following \nhypothesis: \n \nH-4.9:  Retained director ownership is positively associated with underpricing in IPO firms \n 17 \n \nThe testing of these hypotheses is complicated given the presence of endogeneity issues and the \npotential for reverse causation between levels of block-shareholder ownership and underpricing and \nvice-versa.  However while this is of particular concern in developed markets that commonly adhere \nto common law the less developed nature of civil code markets and in particular those of the West \nAfrican nations infers that market-determined outcomes of levels of ownership are less likely \n(Filatotchev et al (2005); Kaserer and Moldenhauer (2008)).  As such the degree of reverse causation \nand feedback between variables is somewhat mitigated. \nGiven the considerable consternation regarding these endogeneity issues the employment of \ntwo stage least squares (2SLS) techniques using instruments variables is preferable to the standard \nOLS methods.  Two-stage least squares (2SLS) is a special case of instrumental variables regression.  \nThis employs two distinct stages with the first stage finding the portions of the endogenous and \nexogenous variables that can be attributed to the instruments.  This stage involves estimating an OLS \nregression of each variable in the model on the set of instruments.  The second stage is a regression of \nthe original equation, with all of the variables replaced by the fitted values from the first-stage \nregressions.  The coefficients of this regression are the 2SLS estimates.  Firm and Legal control \nvariables are as defined in previous sections.  Additional Instrument variables used are both \ndichotomous with Underwriter is foreign and Founder on board taking value 1 if condition is satisfied \nand 0 otherwise.  These instruments are justified on justified on basis of low correlations with all \nother variables \n \n4.  EMPIRICAL RESULTS \n \n4.1.  Descriptive statistics \nThe evidence from Table 2 reveals considerable differences between civil and common law markets \nacross West Africa.  Mean levels of underpricing and absolute numbers of IPOs are three times \ngreater in common law markets than in their civil law counterparts.  However the greatest differential \nis in the amounts raised between the two types of markets.  Mean IPO gross placement proceeds in \ncommon law markets of Ghana and Nigeria are over ten times that of the mean amount raised in the \ncivil law markets of BRVM, Cameroon and Cape Verde Islands.  These findings alone lend \nsubstantial support for the evidence in La Porta et al (2008) regarding considerable differences \nbetween the two legal regimes where firms in civil code law markets are more likely to raise capital \nfrom internal sources or relationship-based banking systems while firms in common law countries are \nmore market-orientated owing to improved investor protection. \n \nTables 2 and 3 \n 18 \n \nThe evidence from Table 3 reveals both low levels of correlation across variables within the sample \nand a general lack of statistical significance of the correlations that do exist.  This would infer that \nmulticollinearity is not a significant concern for this sample in the ensuing regression models. \n \n4.2.  IPO Firm underpricing \nThe evidence from Figure 1 reveals that there is a curvilinear (U-shaped) relationship between \ndirector ownership and underpricing in line with expectations from hypothesis 1.1.  Underpricing first \ndecreases to a minimum owing to incentive alignment issues before increasing owing to increasing \nconcerns over conflicts of interest and high private benefits of control.  Equally consistent with \nhypothesis 1.2 the evidence from Figure 2 reveals that the relationship between founder retained \nownership post-IPO and underpricing is inverted curvilinear (inverted U-shape).  The relationship is \ninitially dominated by concerns over entrenchment, expropriation and high private benefits of control \nbefore these subside when ownership reaches approximately 60% where underpricing peaks and then \ndecreases as the benefits from the presence of large corporate insider block-shareholder becomes \napparent (Boulton et al, 2009) in terms of an enforcement mechanism for the protection of property \nrights where investors have little recourse in the external legal system. \nFigures 1 and 2 \n \nThe evidence from Tables 4 and 5 relate to underpricing which is reported in the first table at 2 weeks \npost-IPO and then at 180 days post-IPO in the second.  However caution must be exercised as due to \nmissing variables the sample size has decreased to 27 IPO firms which has led to the minimising of \nthe number of independent variables included in line with Good and Hardin (2009).  The evidence \nfrom models 1 to 4 in Table 1 and models 5 to 8 in Table 2 is broadly consistent with large, positive \nand generally statistically significant relationships between the establishment of board level \ncommittees (such as audit, remuneration and accounting) and board size with underpricing.  This is \nlargely consistent with hypotheses 2.2 and 2.6.  This evidence would indicate that larger boards act to \nreduce coordinative efficiency and communication between directors and hence increase the \nlikelihood of asymmetric information and agency cost reflected in underpricing.  However it also \nindicates serious shortcomings in the application of standard models of corporate governance in the \nWest African region with the establishment of board level committees at best being deemed \nsuperfluous and lacking in genuine independence as an effective director level monitoring device.  \nThis is a particularly serious issue in world regions that are dominated by very strong and pervasive \ninformal institutions and weak levels of legal enforcement and property rights protection. \nHowever there is less discernable relationship between underpricing and the governance \nvariables representing the separation of roles of CEO and Chairman and the retention of the founder \n 19 \nas board CEO.  While these coefficients are large and positive in models 1 and 3 in Table 4 and in \nmodel 5 in Table 5 the negative sign in model 7 as well as lack of statistical significance across any of \nthe models infers a lack of consistency with hypotheses 2.4 and 2.8.  Generally across all \nunderpricing models the explanatory power is considerably increased through the inclusion of \ncommittee and board size variables indicating the relative strength of these two governance \nparameters in explaining underpricing. \n In terms of the legal and firm levels control variables and there is a consistently negative and \nstatistically significant relationship between legal origin and underpricing indicating that this is more \nprevalent in common law countries.  Equally there is a large positive and generally statistically \nsignificant relationship between underpricing and natural logarithm of contract enforcement time (in \ndays) revealing underpricing is more prevalent in legal systems characterised by inefficiencies and \nhigh levels of structural rigidity and bureaucracy.  Generally there is a large negative and significant \nrelationship with log tangible assets, which is a proxy for firm size, and a large positive relationship \nwith log revenues indicating underpricing is more prevalent for larger firms with higher revenues.  \nThere is little statistical significance in relationship with total debt to total assets ratio although this is \ngenerally large and positive. \nTables 4 and 5 \n \n4.3.  IPO Firm value \nThe evidence from Table 6 from the regressions of individual governance variables on firm value, in \nmodels 9 to 12 is largely consistent with hypotheses predictions in 2.1, 2.3, 2.5 and 2.7.  It must be \nnoted that in line with the earlier underpricing models the choice of the number of independent \nvariables was made following Good and Hardin (2009) owing to a sample size of 27 caused from \nmissing variables amongst the IPO firms.  However negative relationships are found between every \ngovernance variable and firm value except for board size, although only the coefficients associated \nwith the separation of CEO and Chairman and the establishment of board level committees are \nstatistically significant at the 90% confidence level.  These would infer that higher value firms are \nless likely to have CEO as Chairman, less likely to establish expensive committees as a best practice \ngovernance measure and less likely to have founder retaining role of CEO while more likely to have \nlarger boards although the latter two relationships lack statistical significance at a high level of \nconfidence.  The explanatory power of all models is high being over 45% indicating these governance \nparameters explain much of the variance in firm value across the sample. \n There are some notable relationships between firm and legal control variables and firm value.  \nThe negative and largely statistically significant legal origin coefficient indicates that firms of higher \nvalue are more likely to be in common law markets while the positive and only marginally significant \nrelationship with log contract enforcement indicates that firms of higher value are more likely to be \n 20 \nlocated in weaker legal regimes.  While this may seem at first glance counter-intuitive to the results of \nLevine (2005) and La Porta et al (2008) there are considerable structural inefficiencies in the legal \nenforcement and protection of property rights in Ghana and Nigeria where conclusion of contracts \ntakes 200 and 730 days respectively in contrast to substantially shorter times in the civil code markets \nof Cape Verde, Cote d\u2019Ivoire and Cameroon (World Bank, 2005).  Finally a negative and strongly \nsignificant relationship with log revenues indicates that firms with higher market values have \nconsistently lower revenues. \nTable 6 \n \n4.5.  Determinants of firms establishment of committees and separating role of CEO-Chairman \nThe evidence from logistic regression regarding the determinants behind firms separating the roles of \nCEO and Chairman and establishing committees is provided in Table7.  Model 13 reveals that duality \nof the CEO and Chairman is negatively associated with founder retaining CEO position.  While this is \nconsistent with hypothesis 3.1 it infers that founder-entrepreneurial firms are more likely to instigate \ncorporate governance best practice.  The positive relationships between CEO-Chairman duality lack \nstatistical significance at any discernable confidence level but the positive coefficients offers weak \nsupport for refuting hypotheses 3.2 and 3.3.  The explanatory power of this model is reasonable at \n34.66% although this is significantly lower than in model 14 which assess the determinants for firms \nto establish independent committees.  The evidence in model 14 reveals stronger and overall more \nstatistically significant relationships with the establishment of a committee being negatively and \nstatistically significant to the founder retaining role of CEO which is consistent with hypothesis 3.4.  \nEqually the establishment of a committee is negatively and statistically significantly related to board \nindependence, consistent to hypothesis 3.6, which provides more evidence alluding to the lack of \ngenuine independence of committees and their inability to provide effective monitoring.  Lastly there \nis a weak positive relationship with board size which lacks significance at any discernable confidence \nlevel providing inconclusive evidence relating to hypothesis 3.5.  The negative and statistically \nsignificant relationship between committee establishment and the control variable total debt to total \nassets indicates committees are more likely established in firms with higher levels of debt.  Debt is a \nmore common form of relationship-based finance across West Africa and consequently the \nestablishment of committees may be perceived as being an attempt by firms that finance their \noperations primarily by debt and have been motivated to list due to political pressure in adopting \ngovernance best practice at least nominally. \nTable 7 \n \n4.6.  Determinants and effects of director-shareholder ownership \n 21 \nThe evidence relating to the determinants of CEO and director ownership is provided in models 15 \nand 16 in panel 1 of Table 8.  The relationships in model 15 relating to retained CEO ownership are \nlargely consistent to the hypotheses 4.1 to 4.4.  Increased CEO ownership is negatively and \nsignificantly related to CEO equals Chairman, positively but not significantly related to establishment \nof committees while being positively and significantly related to CEO equals founder.  Lastly retained \nCEO ownership is negatively and significantly related to board size.  None of the legal or firm \ncontrols are statistically significant.  This would infer that CEO ownership is strongly related to the \nseparation of the roles of CEO and Chairman, which is a key governance indicator of quality.  \nHowever it is also related to smaller boards and with the founder retaining CEO role which infers that \nCEO ownership is concerned with enhanced control of the CEO over corporate affairs and a general \nlack of independence.  This is particularly relevant in explaining the early stages of the relation \nbetween director ownership and underpricing in the earlier Figure 1.  The explanatory power of this \nmodel is high at over 78%.  The evidence from model 16 regarding the more general retained \nownership by directors, which includes that of the CEO, exhibits relationships that are very similar to \nthose of the earlier CEO ownership and consistent with hypotheses 4.5 to 4.8.  However the \nrelationship with board size is now positive and lacking statistical significance.  As such the \ndeterminants of increased director level retained ownership is negatively related to role duality \nbetween CEO and Chairman, positively related with founder retaining CEO role and interestingly \npositively and highly significantly related to the establishment of committees.  This would infer that \nwhile corporate insider entrenchment is a concern for increased director ownership the establishment \nof committees may be perceived by West African investors as actually being more closely associated \nwith the dominance of insiders rather than as an effective monitoring mechanism.  Lastly the negative \nand significant legal origin coefficient indicates that retained director ownership is more likely in \ncommon law markets which is in line with the findings of Boulton et al (2009) while it is associated \nwith lower levels of debt in relation to total firm assets. \nTable 8 \n \nThe evidence from panel 2, Table 8 regarding the results from the 2 stage least squares (2SLS) \nregression reveals that retained director ownership has a small positive but highly significant impact \non underpricing.  Mindful of the inference issues associated with very small samples and in particular \na lack of degrees of freedom a lower number of variables were included in model in line with \nrecommendations in Good and Hardin (2009).  Directors retention of ownership can be viewed both \nas a costly signal of quality owing to their sacrificing opportunities to diversify risk as opposed to \nretaining investment in the high quality venture while also being a concern to outside investors owing \nto their entrenchment and potential high private benefits of control.  Interestingly the effect of \nincreased retention of director shareholding leading to higher underpricing is more prevalent in civil \n 22 \ncode markets and those markets with weaker legal regimes, as shown by the positive coefficients on \nboth the legal origin and log contract enforcement control variables.  All firm controls lack statistical \nsignificance at any discernable confidence level.  The explanatory power of this model is over 20% \ninferring some strength in the explanation of variation underpricing across the sample. \n Overall these results would question the wholesale adoption of best practice corporate \ngovernance legislation by authorities in regions where domestic informal institutions, engendered in \nlanguage and traditional values, are often at odds with the formal institutions inherited from former \ncolonial metropoles.  These findings are especially pertinent to smaller developing markets where \ncompetition for foreign portfolio and direct investment is more competitive in the current economic \nclimate following the recent financial crisis of 2008\/2009. \n \n5.  CONCLUSIONS \nThis study investigates the impact of common best practice governance measures on the performance \ncomprehensive sample of IPO firms across the West African region for the period 2000 to 2009.  \nWhile the region is characterised by low levels of property rights protection, ineffective legal \nenforcement and structural rigidity in legal systems which lead to potentially high private benefits of \ncontrol for corporate insiders the evidence suggests that only some of the globally standard best \npractice governance mechanisms are beneficial.  These findings are especially pertinent given that \nmany less developed emerging markets are characterised by both the dominance of social elites in \npolitical economy and informal institutions that engender different economic and social outcomes \nfrom those envisaged in those inherited from former colonial metropoles.  This is of particular \nimportance given the enhanced emphasis on the role of corporate governance legislation and the \ndominance of the Anglo-American shareholder value and European stakeholder models in \ndevelopment policy. \n The findings suggest that the establishment of independent audit and remuneration \ncommittees to monitor directors and insiders is at best superfluous with their presence actually \nincreasing levels of asymmetric information and underpricing.  This would indicate that outside \ninvestors actually view committees as being formally under the control of directors and insiders \nwhich would intuitively be expected in highly relationship-based network political economies which \nplace considerable emphasis on adherence to traditional values and identity.  However the separation \nof the roles of CEO and Chairman and the founder-entrepreneur ceding control of CEO role are \nbeneficial mechanisms in signalling quality to potential outside investors.  However while these \ngovernance mechanisms imply benefits from a reduction in asymmetric information and underpricing \nin line with research in UK and US larger boards have greater coordination and communication \nproblems and their presence is reflected in higher levels of underpricing. \n 23 \nA major concern across West African IPO firms is the impact from high private benefits of \ncontrol arising from too much control and ownership being vested in too few individuals.  Both CEO \nand director ownership is determined largely by whether the founder retains the position of CEO as \nwell as board size inferring concerns over moral hazard arising from CEO control and domination of \nthe board.  This is especially evident with a very large relationship between underpricing and the \npresence of committees indicating that investors perceive these in a very different way from their \nWestern counterparts in lacking genuine independence and ability to effectively monitor.  In \nconclusion while West African firms have adopted corporate governance mechanisms from \ninternational best practice guidelines only some of these recommendations are likely to be effective in \nthe distinctive relationship-focussed business environment with narrow political economies \ncharacterised by social allegiances to traditional values. \n \n \n 24 \nAcknowledgements \nI am grateful for the useful comments and advice from Jenifer Piesse and Ron Smith in completing \nthis work.
