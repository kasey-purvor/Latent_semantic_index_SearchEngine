Wage dispersion\nis essential for constrained efficiency.\nI. Introduction\nIn many markets, the decentralized nature of the interaction prevents\nefficient (Walrasian) exchange. For example, in the labor market, an\nunemployed worker who applies for a job might not be the only ap-\nplicant, in which case one of the other applicants might be hired and\nhe remains unemployed. Nevertheless, when the intensity of search is\nsufficiently high, one might expect the market allocation to be approx-\nimately Walrasian. This is indeed the case in sequential search models\nin which workers apply to one firm at a time, as long as the period\nlength between applications becomes sufficiently small (e.g., Gale 1987;\nThis paper circulated under the title \u201cEfficiency of Simultaneous Directed Search with\nRecall.\u2019\u2019 The idea for this paper grew out of earlier fruitful collaboration with Manolis\nGalenianos. I am also grateful to Ken Burdett, Jan Eeckhout, Stephan Lauermann, Wolfram\nMerzyn, Georg No\u00a8ldeke, Andrew Postlewaite, and Randy Wright for many insightful dis-\ncussions and to the editor Robert Shimer and two anonymous referees for very helpful\ncomments. This paper greatly benefited from the input of seminar participants at nu-\nmerous seminars and conferences. Financial support by the National Science Foundation,\ngrant SES-0752076, is gratefully acknowledged.\n862 journal of political economy\nMortensen and Wright 2002; Lauermann 2006; Satterthwaite and Shney-\nerov 2007).\nIn many search environments the period length may not be small,\nthough. The hiring process, for example, may induce a substantial lag\nbetween the time when a worker applies for a job and the point at which\nthe final hiring decision is reached. Van Ours and Ridder (1992) find\nin Dutch data a delay of 1\u20132 months to select an employee from an\ninitial pool of applicants.1 Delays are even larger in occupations in which\nentry positions are filled only in fixed (e.g., annual) intervals. In such\nenvironments the efficient Walrasian outcome is unattainable if workers\ncan apply to only one firm in each selection period. However, the threat\nof not obtaining a job and having to wait another period is exactly what\nprovides incentives for workers to send multiple applications simulta-\nneously to several firms. The idea to model search as a simultaneous\napplication process goes back to the foundations of labor search in\nStigler (1962), and the ability of this channel to generate efficient equi-\nlibrium outcomes has recently been explored by Acemog\u02d8lu and Shimer\n(2000), Gautier and Moraga-Gonza\u00b4les (2005), Albrecht, Gautier, and\nVroman (2006), and Galenianos and Kircher (2008). None of these find\nconvergence to the Walrasian limit when the application costs vanish.2\nThis paper considers the efficiency of simultaneous search in a di-\nrected search environment in which each firm has one job and posts a\nwage to attract workers. Subsequently, workers decide to which firms\nthey want to apply. Search frictions imply that workers might not obtain\nthe job they apply for, which provides incentives to apply to several firms\ndespite the fact that applications are costly. The frictions arise because\nworkers cannot coordinate their applications and sometimes multiple\nworkers apply for the same job. In contrast to the earlier literature that\nhas restricted firms to communicate with only one of their applicants\nand to leave the job vacant if this applicant turns down the offer (even\nif many other workers applied for the job), here firms are allowed to\ncommunicate with all their applicants. It is shown that the market al-\n1 A concern for delays in hiring is warranted mainly in skill-intensive occupations. Van\nOurs and Ridder (1992) find little delay for low-education jobs, but delays become sub-\nstantial as the educational requirement of the job increases.\n2 Acemog\u02d8lu and Shimer (2000) and Albrecht et al. (2006) explicitly consider limit results,\nwhich still feature a non-Walrasian component. Gautier and Moraga-Gonza\u00b4les (2005) and\nGalenianos and Kircher (2008) do not explicitly consider limit results, but by the close\nresemblance of their trading environment with that of Albrecht et al., they inherit the\ninefficiencies of that model. Classical equilibrium search papers such as Butters (1977)\nand Burdett and Judd (1983) also consider simultaneous search but focus on the distri-\nbution of wages. Except for the costs of information acquisition, these classical papers\nlack a margin of efficiency, since each firm can service the entire market. Efficiency\nquestions are also absent in the original contribution by Stigler (1962), since he models\nthe workers in a partial equilibrium setting in which the benefit from matching for the\nfirms is not considered.\nefficiency of simultaneous search 863\nlocation approaches the Walrasian outcome when search costs become\nsmall. This result highlights how Stigler\u2019s notion of simultaneous search\nprovides a foundation for Walrasian equilibrium when search costs are\nsmall and wages are determined by optimizing firms. Furthermore, it\nis shown that the equilibrium is constrained efficient even when search\ncosts are nonnegligible.\nThe theory presented in this paper relies on two assumptions re-\ngarding the ability of firms to interact with workers: firms can compete\nfor workers through binding wage announcements, and firms are able\nto communicate with all their applicants in the hiring process. To in-\ncorporate the latter, a new theory of matching is proposed. It is based\non the idea that communication leads to a stable matching among the\nfirms and their applicants. Stability here means that a firm does not\nleave the job vacant while one of its applicants starts to work at a lower\nwage or remains unemployed.3 In such a case, both the firm and the\nworker would be better off by deviating and forming a match between\nthemselves. While stability is imposed by assumption, it arises naturally\nif firms offer their job sequentially to applicants and workers are free\nto reconsider their options. During such a process a high-wage firm can\nentice a worker away from lower-wage competitors, and a job remains\nvacant only if all the firm\u2019s offers get rejected in favor of better alter-\nnatives.4 In this setup, a firm can communicate only with those workers\nwho applied to the firm, and therefore the model naturally differs from\nthe existing stability analysis that presumes that all agents in the econ-\nomy communicate with one another.\nThe central results in this paper concern the efficiency of the equi-\nlibrium. The efficient Walrasian outcome obtains in the limit as search\ncosts vanish. Even when search costs are nontrivial, the equilibrium\ninteraction is constrained efficient. The miscoordination between work-\ners in their application decisions renders perfect matching impossible,\nleading to the standard result of the search literature that the labor\nmarket does not perfectly clear and therefore some workers face pro-\nlonged unemployment. Nevertheless, given the miscoordination and the\n3 Wages are treated as fixed in the matching stage. The implications and the applicability\nof this assumption are discussed in Sec. VI. This notion of stability has been successfully\napplied in many areas. In a recent paper, Bulow and Levin (2006) also deploy matching\nat fixed wages after a noncooperative wage-setting stage but assume that all workers apply\nto all firms.\n4 Such a sequential process resembles the well-known deferred acceptance process. For\nfinite economies, it converges in finite time. For the continuum economy, stability is\nimposed to capture the spirit of a process by which firms contact all their applicants. In\ncontrast to the standard matching literature that pioneered these concepts (see Gale and\nShapley 1962), this paper deals with much less heterogeneity (essentially coming only\nthrough the wage-setting process, though some additional heterogeneity is discussed in\nSec. VI) but adds the novelty that stability is defined only for agents that got to know each\nother in the application process.\n864 journal of political economy\nnotion of stability, the equilibrium is constrained efficient along the\nfollowing operative margins even when application costs are nonnegli-\ngible. Entry efficiency: the constrained optimal number of firms enter.\nEfficiency of search intensity: the number of applications that workers send\nis constrained efficient. Search efficiency: workers send their applications\nin a way that induces the optimal number of matches. Thus, even when\nworkers choose their search intensity strategically by deciding on a finite\nset of firms to which they apply at nonnegligible costs, market wages\nare such that workers make the socially optimal application decisions\nand firms provide the socially optimal number of jobs.\nAs a by-product the analysis reveals that wage dispersion is crucial to\nachieve constrained efficiency when workers apply for more than one\njob, even though workers and firms are homogeneous and risk neutral.\nLow-wage jobs endogenously create a safety net for workers who are\nunsuccessful with their other applications. In contrast, with a single\nwage, workers would apply randomly to firms, which too often generates\nseveral offers for some workers and none to others. The idea that match-\ning frictions induce wage dispersion even in settings in which workers\nand firms are homogeneous has been pursued in a large body of work,5\nyet the insight that wage dispersion might arise in such a setting as the\noptimal response of the market to deal with the matching frictions is\nnew to the literature. In this model, wage dispersion divides the market\ninto separate wage segments that attract one application from each\nworker. These segments resemble standard one-application markets, and\nthe insights from the simpler one-application models carry over. In par-\nticular, the equilibrium wage in each segment is characterized by a\nmodified version of Hosios\u2019 (1990) condition for optimal entry by firms.\nEarlier work on simultaneous search did not find constrained efficient\noutcomes, nor convergence in the limit to the Walrasian allocation. This\nhas two main reasons. In Acemog\u02d8lu and Shimer (2000) and Gautier\nand Moraga-Gonza\u00b4les (2005), workers do not observe all wage offers\nwhen they make their search decision, which induces equilibrium wages\nthat do not reflect the workers\u2019 marginal product. In directed search\nmodels, workers can observe all wage offers, and a central insight of\nthis literature is that equilibrium wages do reflect the workers\u2019 marginal\nproduct (see, e.g., Moen 1997; Shi 2001; Shimer 2005) when workers\nsend one application. Albrecht et al. (2006) and Galenianos and Kircher\n(2008) show that this insight might not be valid when workers apply to\nmultiple firms. The main reason is a contractual incompleteness: A\nfirm\u2019s wage offer rewards a worker only for applying to it, but this reward\n5 See, e.g., Butters (1977), Burdett and Judd (1983), Burdett and Mortensen (1998),\nAcemog\u02d8lu and Shimer (2000), Mortensen (2003), Delacroix and Shi (2004), Albrecht et\nal. (2006), Gaumont, Schindler, and Wright (2006), and Galenianos and Kircher (2008).\nefficiency of simultaneous search 865\nis not conditional on the other firms to which the worker applied (even\nthough job offers from these other firms potentially affect the first firm\nnegatively). In these earlier models this problem was exacerbated by\nthe assumption that each firm can talk to only one of its applicants and\nits job remains vacant if this applicant declines its offer in favor of a\ndifferent firm. This has the counterintuitive effect that the number of\nmatches may go down when workers apply more often since some work-\ners get multiple offers that prevent others from obtaining jobs. This\nfeature prevents convergence to the Walrasian limit. In this model, firms\ncan communicate with all workers in a way that leads to a stable match-\ning. While stability is no guarantee for efficiency, it does have the feature\nthat a worker who rejects a job does not block other workers from getting\nemployed there, which is crucial for the limit result. Additionally, in\nequilibrium the contractual incompleteness is solved because of the\ninteraction among workers themselves: if some applicants apply else-\nwhere, the job becomes more attractive and other workers will apply\nthere more strongly. Through this channel the noncontracted exter-\nnality is internalized. This point is somewhat subtle and is elaborated\non in the discussion section.\nTo my knowledge, this is the first attempt to integrate the two-sided\nstrategic considerations of a search environment with stability concepts\nused in matching markets.6 The paper draws on three strands of liter-\nature. Insights from the directed search literature (e.g., Peters 1991;\nBurdett, Shi, and Wright 2001) informed the modeling of the frictions\nand information flows in the market. With multiple applications, work-\ners face a simultaneous portfolio choice. For this type of problem Chade\nand Smith (2006) consider an individual agent\u2019s choice and derive a\nsimple characterization of the optimal decision rule; Galenianos and\nKircher (2008) derive implications in an equilibrium search framework.\nFor the final matching, the stability concept pioneered by Gale and\nShapley (1962) is applied to the network formed in the search process.\nSince notation and exposition are much more tractable when at most\ntwo applications per worker are considered, Sections II\u2013IV are restricted\nto this case. Section II presents the model. Section III characterizes the\nconstrained optimal allocation. Section IV shows that the decentralized\neconomy implements the constrained efficient allocation. Section V lifts\nthe restriction of two applications per worker and, additionally, discusses\nconvergence when application costs vanish. Section VI discusses in more\ndetail why efficiency prevails in this environment but failed in related\nmodels and which of the assumptions are crucial for this result. It also\n6 Gautier and Moraga-Gonza\u00b4lez (2005) present a three-player example with a similar\nconcept for random search.\n866 journal of political economy\noutlines how heterogeneity can be introduced into this setting. Section\nVII presents conclusions. Omitted proofs are gathered in the Appendix.\nII. The Model\nThis section presents the physical environment, as well as some restric-\ntions on the equilibrium set that are intended to capture the search\nfrictions of a large market.\nPlayers and preferences.\u2014The economy consists of a continuum of size\n1 of unemployed workers and a large continuum of firms, with a measure\nv active in equilibrium.7 Each firm has a single vacant job, which, if\nfilled, produces one unit of output. All agents are risk neutral. Each\nfirm maximizes its expected output minus wage and entry costs. Each\nworker maximizes his expected wage payments minus the cost of ap-\nplying for jobs.\nThe labor market interaction.\u2014The market interaction proceeds in three\nstages. In the first stage, firms can become active by posting a wage that\nthey commit to pay when they hire a worker. A firm that becomes active\nincurs an entry cost that reflects the costs of setting up the jobK ! 1\nand advertising it to workers. In the second stage, workers observe all\nactive firms and their wage postings. Each worker decides on the number\ni of applications he wants to send at cost , which subsumes monetaryc(i)\nas well as time and effort costs. A worker who does not send applications\ndoes not incur any costs. The marginal costs arec p c(i) \u0001 c(i \u0001 1)i\neverywhere weakly increasing, and they are strictly positive at some finite\n.

After the applications are sent out, they form the links in a\nnetwork between workers and firms: each worker is linked to the firms\nto which he applied and each firm is linked to its applicants. In the\nfinal stage, workers and firms form matches, the announced wage is\npaid, and matched pairs start production.\nMatching.\u2014The matching in the final stage is assumed to be stable\non the network: matches form such that a firm\u2019s job remains vacant\nonly if either it has no applicants or all its applicants are matched at\nweakly higher wages. This concept of pairwise stability is motivated by\nthe fact that otherwise the vacant firm could offer its job to the applicant\nwho is matched at a lower wage, and both would be jointly better off\nby forming a match between themselves. For economies with a finite\nnumber of workers and firms, a stable matching is reached by an ex-\n7 Since constant returns to scale in matching will be assumed, only the ratio of workers\nto active firms matters.\nefficiency of simultaneous search 867\ntensive form game in which firms successively make offers to workers,\nworkers hold on to the best offer they have so far received and decline\nothers, and rejected firms make additional offers until every firm either\nhas a worker or has no applicants left to whom it could offer the job\n(see Gale and Shapley 1962). The approach in this paper can be viewed\nas a limit of such an interaction when the number of agents gets large,\nbut following the literature on matching with a continuum number of\nagents, the paper imposes stability directly rather than considering the\nconvergence of the extensive form.8 The difference between this paper\nand the earlier literature is that here stability refers only to firms and\nworkers that got to know each other through the (endogenous) appli-\ncation process. The main implication of pairwise stability is that firms\nwith higher wages hire \u201cfirst,\u201d and firms at lower wages can hire only\nthose applicants who have not obtained a higher-paying job. This notion\nof stability presumes that firms cannot react to other firms\u2019 offers and\nare committed to their wage announcement\u2014an assumption that is\ndiscussed in detail in Section VI, where the forces leading to efficiency\nare highlighted.\nAnonymity assumptions.\u2014There exist many subgame-perfect strategies\nby which workers might apply for jobs after observing the wages, in-\ncluding the frictionless case in which each worker applies to a different\nfirm (if enough firms entered). Here the attention is on a market that\nis large and anonymous. To capture this, in the spirit of the directed\nsearch literature, consider equilibrium strategies that are symmetric and\nanonymous. Anonymity means that agents that are observationally iden-\ntical except for their name are treated identically. Anonymity is assumed\nboth at the application and the hiring stages. In particular, the following\nassumptions are made:\n8 The extensive form process terminates in finite time, i.e., after a finite number of\nrounds of offers, for any economy with a finite number of workers and firms as shown in\nGale and Shapley (1962). Yet as the size of the economy extends to infinity, the time to\ntermination might tend to infinity as well. In this regard, note the following: If workers\nwho currently hold an offer inform all firms with lower offers that they are no longer\navailable, even in this continuum economy the process terminates in finite time in the\noptimal assignment and in the decentralized equilibrium. In particular, the number of\nrounds of offers equals the highest number of applications sent by an individual worker.\nThis cannot be ensured for suboptimal assignments and nonequilibrium interactions,\nthough. Even for such interactions, Kircher (2006) shows that the measure of agents that\nare not stably matched (in the sense that they could form blocking pairs among the agents\nthey are linked to) converges to zero as the number of rounds goes to infinity. Nevertheless,\nfull stability might not be reached in finite time.\nFor stability in continuum models, see, e.g., Kaneko and Wooders (1986) or Gretzky,\nOstroy, and Zame (1999).\n868 journal of political economy\n1. A firm only observes whether a worker applied to it or not. It cannot\nobtain a report or direct evidence from a worker about the other\nfirms to which he has applied. Anonymity then implies that a firm\nhires at random one of those applicants who lack better offers.\n2. All workers use the same application strategies and do not condition\non the firms\u2019 identities. They treat firms at different wages differ-\nently, but firms with the same wage are treated identically.\nThe first assumption deals with ties in the hiring process that arise\nbecause workers are identical. These ties are broken randomly, which\nimplies that the process selects neither the best nor the worst stable\nmatching. To see this, consider a firm that has two applicants A and B\nand breaks the tie between them by randomly hiring one of them. If\napplicant A applied nowhere else whereas applicant B also applied for\na lower-wage job for which he is the only applicant, then it would be\nstrictly more efficient to deterministically break the tie in favor of A and\nstrictly less efficient to break it in favor of B. Note, though, that firms\ndo not directly benefit from improved matches at other (lower-wage)\nfirms. Therefore, any small amount of noise about match-specific quality\nof the applicants would lead firms to pick the most suitable candidate\nin a way that looks random to an outsider rather than choose the can-\ndidate who improves the match at another firm.\nThe second assumption creates the frictions that make tie-breaking\nnecessary: the use of identical and anonymous strategies by the workers\nimplies that they randomize equally over firms with the same wage and\nsometimes miscoordinate in the sense that several of them apply for\nthe same job that only one of them can get.9 The next section discusses\nin detail how these assumptions translate into the hiring probabilities\nin the economy.\nIII. Social Planner\u2019s Problem\nBefore turning to the equilibrium interaction between workers and\nfirms, it is instructive to first consider the related problem of a social\nplanner. Following Pissarides (2000) and others, consider a planner who\nhas the same choice margins and restrictions that the agents in the\ndecentralized equilibrium face. In terms of choice margins, the planner\ndetermines the number of firms that enter the economy, the number\nof applications that workers send, and where these applications are sent.\nIn terms of restrictions, the planner is subject to the two anonymity\n9 Miscoordination arises even when there are fewer workers than firms, and even when\nall firms offer different wages. In the latter case, symmetric, i.e., identical, strategies still\nimply that workers all apply to any given set of firms with the same probability. For a\ncareful argument in one-application environments, see Peters (1997).\nefficiency of simultaneous search 869\nrestrictions and to the final matching stage that was imposed on the\ndecentralized equilibrium. Placing these restrictions on the planner\ngives a relevant benchmark for comparing the efficiency of the decen-\ntralized wage competition. Without the anonymity restrictions the plan-\nner could trivially do better by assigning only one worker to each firm\nand avoiding the miscoordination in the application process, or by co-\nordinating the tie-breaking in the matching stage across firms. Since\nthe efficiency concept takes these features of the environment as given\nand does not assess which other matching concepts can improve the\noutcome further, the resulting optimum is called constrained efficient.\nA. Planner\u2019s Choices, Resulting Output, and Efficiency Criterion\nPlanner\u2019s choice set.\u2014The social planner can choose the measure v of\nfirms in the economy. He can also choose the probability that a workergi\nsends i applications. By the usual law of large number convention, this\ncoincides with the fraction of workers who send i applications. Since we\nare considering the case in which workers have at most two applications,\nthe planner chooses a search intensity in the three-gp (g , g , g )0 1 2\ndimensional unit simplex D3.\nIn the decentralized economy, firms are distinguished only by a one-\ndimensional attribute, the wage. This one-dimensional attribute allows\nworkers to discriminate between firms. Symmetry and anonymity pre-\nclude any further differentiation. While the planner does not care about\nwages per se because they are just transfers, he might want to distinguish\nbetween firms to allow workers to apply in a better way. To incorporate\nthis, the planner is allowed to distinguish firms along a single dimension\nby assigning them to different locations. Stability in the final matching\nstage translates into the requirement that a firm remains vacant only if\nall its applicants are matched at a weakly higher location.\nThe planner can choose a finite set of locations and can thenLO \u0002\nassign firms and applications to any location . To formalize thel \u0001 L\nassignment, let and be the set of cumulative distribution functions1 2F FL L\nover L and .

Without loss of generality let the first argument refer to thel 2\nlower location; that is, only if .g (l , l ) 1 0 l \u2264 l2 1 2 1 2\nOutput and hiring probabilities.\u2014The output in the economy coincides\nwith the number of matches in the economy. How these are determined\nby the application behavior and the assumptions on matching is laid\nout in the following. Let denote the probability that a firm at locationhl\nl hires a worker, and let be the probability that a worker who appliespl\nto location l would get hired there if he wants the job (i.e., if he has\nno offer from a higher location). As in other directed search models,\nthe probabilities and depend on the number of applications relativeh pl l\nto the number of firms at a given location. This ratio is called the gross\nqueue length because it describes the average queue of applications per\njob at a location l and is defined as\nL \u2032 \u2032g g (l) \u0002 g \u0001 [g (l , l) \u0002 g (l, l )]\u20321 1 2 2 2l p1\nl p (1)l vf(l)\nwhen . When , the absence of firms trivially impliesvf(l) 1 0 vf(l)p 0\nthat there are no matches at this location.\nThe important novelty in this setup is that a firm might not be able\nto hire even if it obtains an application, because the applicant might\nhave applied to another firm at a higher location and obtained a job\nthere. Applications are called \u201ceffective\u201d if the applicant does not obtain\na higher job. Denote by the fraction of applications that are notwl\neffective in the sense that the applicant is unavailable for hiring because\nof higher-ranked alternatives. The ratio of effective applications to firms\nat location l is called the effective queue length at location l and is defined\nas\nm p (1 \u0001 w)l . (2)l l l\nOwing to the anonymity of the workers\u2019 strategy, the effective appli-\ncations that are sent to firms at location l are uniformly distributed over\nthese firms. Therefore, the number of effective applications at any in-\ndividual firm at this location is random. It has been shown that the\ndistribution of effective applications at any individual firm is given by\na Poisson distribution with parameter , which implies that the prob-ml\nability that a firm receives no effective applications is .10 If the firm\u0001mle\n10 This is obtained by considering a finite number of effective applications that are\nrandomly distributed to a finite number of firms and by taking the limit as the number\nof applications and firms converges to infinity while retaining a ratio . A simple derivationml\nis provided, e.g., in Burdett et al. (2001). They also provide careful and intuitive derivations\nfor the following expressions for the hiring probabilities and in eqq. (3) andh(7) p(7)\n(4).\nefficiency of simultaneous search 871\nreceives at least one effective application, it is able to fill its vacancy,\nbecause once a firm has a worker who is not employed at a better\nlocation, it will not remain unmatched by our stability assumption.\nTherefore, the hiring probability for a firm at location l is\n\u0001mlh p 1 \u0001 e . (3)l\nNext, consider the probability of getting a job at location l for a worker\nwho wants to obtain a job at that location, that is, who is effective in\nthe sense that he did not get a job offer from a higher location. The\nworker cares about only those rival applicants who do not have a higher\noffer either, because those workers who take higher jobs are not com-\npeting for this job. Given that there are matches per firm and\u0001ml1 \u0001 e\neffective applications per firm, the probability of an effective appli-ml\ncation yielding a match is given by\n\u0001ml1 \u0001 e\np p , (4)l\nml\nwith the convention that if .p p 1 m p 0l l\nThe probability that an applicant is not available for hiring becausewl\nhe accepts some (weakly) higher offer is trivially zero if workers send\nonly one application and irrelevant if no worker applies to location l.\nOtherwise, consider some application sent to location l, and let \u2032g\u02c6(l Fl)\ndenote the probability that the sender mailed a second application and\nsent it to location .11 The applicant takes a job from a strictly higher\u2032l\nlocation if he applied to a strictly higher location and receives an offer.\nHe takes an equally high offer if he applied to another firm at the same\nlocation, this other firm also wants to hire him, and the applicant\nchooses the other firm over the current firm. One can think about\nworkers who apply twice to the same location as randomizing in advance\nabout which offer they would prefer to accept in case they get equivalent\noffers. Since workers do not condition their choices on the identities\nof firms, both firms have equal chances of attracting the worker, and\ntherefore an application is not effective with probability be-g\u02c6(lFl)p \/2l\ncause of offers from other equally high firms.

This is due\nto the assumption that ties are broken irrelevant of the matching at\nlower locations. These values are then used to evaluate the correspond-\ning terms at lower locations. Since the specification allows firms to hire\nany worker who is not matched at a higher or equally high location,\nthe final matching is stable in the sense that no firm is vacant while\none of its applicants is unmatched or matched at a strictly lower location.\nPlanner\u2019s objective.\u2014The firms\u2019 hiring probability is uniquely deter-hl\nmined by the planner\u2019s choice of entry v, number of applications\n, number of locations L, and distributions F, , andgp (g , g , g ) G0 1 2 1\nfor firms and workers over these locations. LetG M(v, g, L, F, G ,2 1\ndenote the resulting output in the economy.

Next, entry efficiency is analyzed by additionally consid-\nering the optimal entry of firms. Finally, the efficiency of the search\nintensity is analyzed by additionally characterizing the optimal number\nof applications. The last step coincides with the notion of constrained\nefficiency.\nB. Search Efficiency, Given Entry and Search Intensity\nTake entry v and search intensity as given and considergp (g , g , g )0 1 2\nthe solution to the maximization problem (6) over the restricted pa-\nrameter set {L, F, , }. The solution to this restricted problem isG G1 2\ncalled \u201csearch efficient.\u201d Clearly, if either or , there is noth-vp 0 g p 10\ning to analyze because there will be no matches in the economy. The\ncase in which workers send only one application ( ) is well un-g p 02\nderstood: Search efficiency is achieved with only one location at which\nworkers who send an application randomly apply for jobs (see, e.g.,\nShimer 2005).\nHere, the focus is on the novel case in which at least some workers\nsend two applications (i.e., ). Given the possibly large number ofg 1 02\nlocations and the possibility to correlate applications across locations,\nthis is a nontrivial problem. The first result significantly simplifies the\nproblem by showing that search efficiency does not require more lo-\ncations than applications sent by an individual worker, which means that\nefficiency of simultaneous search 873\ntwo locations suffice. Moreover, the optimal search strategyLp {1, 2}\nis simple: every worker with a single application sends it to location 1\nand workers with two applications send one to location 1 and the other\nto location 2.\nLemma 1. For given entry and search intensity g with ,v 1 0 g 1 02\noutput is maximized with locations,M(v, g, L, F, G , G ) Lp {1, 2}1 2\n, , and appropriate F.g (1)p 1 g (1, 2)p 11 2\nThe intuitive argument behind the formal proof, which is presented\nin the Appendix, is the following. Any location with effective queue\nlength m can be subdivided into two locations that both have queue\nlength m. This does not change the number of matches since firms hire\nwith exactly the same probability as before. Moreover, it is possible to\nassign low and single applications to one of the locations and high\napplications to the other while retaining the ratio m of effective appli-\ncations to firms at each location, because the number of firms at each\nof the locations can be varied appropriately. That leaves us with a set\nof locations that receive low (or single) applications and a set of locations\nthat receive high applications. Because the firms\u2019 matching probability\nis concave, it is optimal that all locations in each set have the\u0001m1 \u0001 e\nsame queue length, and so the locations in each set can be merged\nwithout loss of efficiency. There is no loss to optimality by having both\nsingle and low applications at the same location, because a worker who\nsends two applications but is unsuccessful with his high application is\nin the same situation as a worker who sends only one application. So\nconditional on failing at the high location, their problem looks identical.\nThe trade-off for high and low applications is different, though, and it\nwill not be optimal to have equal expected queue lengths in both lo-\ncations, as we will see in the following.\nGiven lemma 1, we have to characterize only the distribution F, that\nis, the fraction of firms at each of the two locations. Let f(1)p 1 \u0001 r\nand . The social planner chooses the optimal fraction of firmsf(2)p r\nat each of the locations to maximize the output according to\n\u0001m \u0001m\u02dc 1 2max M(r)p (1 \u0001 r)v(1 \u0001 e ) \u0002 rv(1 \u0001 e ), (7)\nr\u0001[0,1]\nwhere the first term reflects the measure of firms at the low location\ntimes their matching probability.

(8)1 2dr v\nSince the first two terms in parentheses are strictly increasing in ,mi\nequation (8) immediately implies that . Therefore, it is optimalm 1 m2 1\nthat jobs at the lower locations are easier to get. The intuition for this\nresult comes from the idea of a safety net: Those workers who end up\ngetting jobs at the low location will be unemployed if they do not get\nthe job, and so the planner assigns many firms to this location to make\nit easy for these workers to get matched. In contrast, those workers who\nget jobs at the high location also applied for low-location jobs and might\nget hired there even in the absence of the high-location job. Therefore,\nworkers who end up at the high location are less at risk, and it is optimal\nto make it harder for them and easier for the others.\nEquation (8) becomes even more intuitive when we interpret it from\nthe firms\u2019 point of view. The terms reflect the additional\u0001m mi i1 \u0001 e \u0001 m ei\nprobability of generating a match at location i when adding one more\nfirm to that location. It entails the probability that the additional\u0001mi1 \u0001 e\nfirm can hire minus the \u201cbusiness stealing\u201d effect on other firms at the\nsame location. The latter effect coincides with the probability thatmim ei\nthe other firms had exactly one applicant who is stolen from them. At\nlocation 1, business stealing is restricted to this location only, because\nno worker with a job offer from location 2 will be \u201cstolen\u201d by an ad-\nditional firm at location 1. This is different at location 2. Every additional\nmatch created at location 2 takes away an effective applicant from lo-\ncation 1. Therefore, the additional output is not one unit but is de-\ncreased by the probability that the firm at the low location had only\u0001m1e\nthis one worker and can no longer produce.13 Equation (8) therefore\nequates the marginal benefit of a firm at the first location to the marginal\nbenefit at the second location. Since both \u2019s are functions only of themi\nfraction r of firms at the high location (given g and v), equation (8)\n12 The first derivative of (7) is\n\u0001m\u02dc 1dM dp dl e dl2 1 2\u0001m \u0001l \u0001l1 2 2p \u0001(1\u0001 e )\u0002 (1\u0001 e )\u0002 \u0001g l \u0002 (g \u0002 g \u0001 g p ) \u0002 re v.2 1 1 2 2 2{ [ ] }dr dr d r vl d r1\nThe last summand in the braces equals , the third summand equals\u0001l \u0001m2 1\u0001l e e [\u0001(1\u00012\n, and .\u0001l \u0001l2 2e \u0001 l e )\u0002 m ] m p l2 1 2 2\n13 The adjustment also coincides with the probability that a low-location firm\u0001m11\u0001 e\nhires a worker, but this is coincidence in the special case in which all firms have equal\nproductivity, as can be seen in n. 36, which considers differences in firms\u2019 productivities.\nefficiency of simultaneous search 875\nsuffices to determine the optimal fraction of firms uniquely.14 Optimality\nis ensured by global concavity.15\nSince high-location firms have an additional business stealing effect,\nthe optimal number of firms relative to the number of effective appli-\ncations is lower. Therefore, despite homogeneity of labor, it is optimal\nto implement different hiring probabilities at different firms, which\nnecessitates more than one location.\nLemma 2.

The Decentralized Economy\nThis section focuses on the interaction in the decentralized economy,\nand it is shown that it implements the constrained efficient solution.\nA. Strategies, Expected Payoffs, and Equilibrium Definition\nStrategies.\u2014In the decentralized economy, a pure strategy for a firm\nthat enters is a wage offer . In order to highlight the con-w \u0001 [0, 1]\nefficiency of simultaneous search 877\nnection between the decentralized problem and the social planner\u2019s\nproblem, with slight abuse of notation, the same names will be used for\ndistributions over wages that were used in the planner\u2019s problem for\ndistributions over locations. Then F denotes the wage distribution, with\nsupport denoted by . That is, gives the proportion of firms thatF F(w)\noffer wages below w. A worker observes the distribution of posted wages\nand then chooses the number of applications and the firms to which\nhe sends them. Given the focus on anonymous strategies, a worker\napplies with equal probability to all firms with the same wage.16 There-\nfore, his choice of firm can be summarized by its wage. A mixed strategy\nfor a worker is then given by the tuples andgp (g , g , g ) Gp (G ,0 1 2 1\n. The term is the probability of sending i applications; givesG ) g G (w)2 i 1\nthe probability that the worker sends his application to a firm with a\nwage below w when he sends just one application; and givesG (w , w )2 1 2\nthe probability that the worker applies for a job with a wage below w1\nwith the first and below with the second application when he sendsw 2\ntwo applications, where we assume throughout. Since we assumew \u2265 w2 1\nthat workers use symmetric strategies, these probabilities also reflect the\nfraction of the population that undertake a given action.\nExpected payoffs.\u2014Expected payoffs for firms and workers obtain as\nfollows. Let denote the probability that a firm posting wage w hiresh(w)\na worker. Let be the probability that an effective applicant at wagep(w)\nw gets hired. These probabilities depend on the strategies, as described\nbelow. The expected profit of a firm posting wage w, omitting entry\ncosts, is\np(w)p h(w)(1 \u0001 w). (14)\nThe profits equal the hiring probability multiplied by the profit margin\nif a worker is hired.\nThe utility of a worker who sends no application is . A workerU p 00\nwho sends one application to a firm with wage w obtains utility\nU (w)p p(w)w \u0001 c(1), (15)1\nthat is, the expected wage minus the cost of the application. A worker\nwho applies for a job with wages , , obtains utility(w , w ) w \u2265 w1 2 2 1\nU (w , w )p p(w )w \u0002 [1 \u0001 p(w )]p(w )w \u0001 c(2). (16)2 1 2 2 2 2 1 1\nThe worker\u2019s utility is given by the wage if he is hired at that wage,w 2\nwhich happens with probability . With the complementary prob-p(w )2\nability , he does not receive an offer at the high wage, and his1 \u0001 p(w )2\n16 This is optimal if all other workers also follow anonymous strategies. At the expense\nof substantial additional notation, one can show that symmetry rather than anonymity of\nthe workers\u2019 strategy is sufficient to yield identical hiring probabilities to firms with the\nsame wage.\n878 journal of political economy\nutility is if he gets an offer for his low-wage application, which happensw1\nwith probability . He always incurs the cost for the two applications.p(w )1\nHiring probabilities.\u2014The hiring probabilities are analogous to those\nin the planner\u2019s problem. Let be the effective queue length,h(w)\nthe gross queue length, and the probability that an applicantl(w) w(w)\nis not available for hiring at wage w. In direct analogy to equations (2)\u2013\n(4) we have\nm(w)p [1 \u0001 w(w)]l(w), (2 \u2032)\n\u0001m(w)h(w)p 1 \u0001 e , (3 \u2032)\nand\n\u0001m(w)1 \u0001 e\np(w)p , (4 \u2032)\nm(w)\nwith the convention that if .p(w)p 1 m(w)p 0\nTo fix the probability that an applicant is not effective, considerw(w)\nsome application sent to a firm with a wage w in the support of the\nwage offer distribution, and let denote the probability that the\u2032\u02c6G(w Fw)\nsender mailed a second application and sent it to a firm with a wage\nweakly lower then . Let be the probability that the sender\u2032 \u02c6w g(wFw)\nmailed another application to a firm with the same wage.17 Similar to\n(5), is given byw(w)\np(w)\u2032 \u2032\u02c6\n\u02c6w(w)p p(w )dG(w Fw) \u0002 g(wFw).

It is given by the probability that workers who send\none application send it to firms with wages up to w and the probability\nthat workers who send two applications send either their low- or their\nhigh-wage application to firms with wages up to w. These are dispersed\nover the firms that offer wages up to wage w. The mass of received\napplications is specified on the right-hand side. It is given by the ratio\nof applications per firm aggregated over all relevant wages, multiplied\nby the amount v of active firms in the market.\nEquilibrium definition.\u2014Equations (1\u2032)\u2013(5\u2032) give the trading probabil-\nities at wages that are offered in equilibrium, that is, at wages in .F\nBy (15) and (16) a worker can evaluate the optimal utility U *{i\nof sending i applications to firms offering these wages,sup U(w)iw\u0001F i\nwhere w denotes the tuple of wages for which he applies. Then the\nhighest utility that a worker can achieve with the optimal number of\napplications is , which will be referred to as the mar-U *{ max U *i\u0001{0,1,2} i\nket utility.\nSimilarly, every firm that offers a wage in can assess the expectedF\nprofit that it will get. For a firm that deviates and offers a wage w that\nis not offered by any other firm ( ), the effective queue length isw \u0002 F\nnot determined by (1\u2032)\u2013(5\u2032) because no worker is currently applying for\nthat wage. The firm has to anticipate how workers will apply if it offers\nthat wage. Given some effective queue length for the deviant firm,m(w)\nlet be the highest utility that a worker can obtain by applying for\u02c6U(w)\nw and possibly some other wage offered by some other firm.19 Workers\n18 Queue length is simply the Radon-Nikodym derivative, defined on tol(7) \u0002 \u222a {\u0003}\u0002\naccount for the case in which a zero measure of firms might receive a mass of applications.\n19 Given , a worker who applies for w with one application obtains utilitym(w)\ngiven by (15).

Condition 2a states that workers who send i applications send\nthem optimally; that is, they get the highest utility on the support of\ntheir strategy and weakly less elsewhere. Condition 2b requires that work-\ners send out the optimal number of applications. Condition 3 reiterates\nthe conditions on the effective queue length. For conditions 1 and 2,\nthe distinction between a and b allows the discussion of an exogenous\nnumber of applications and an exogenous number of firms using the\nappropriate subset of conditions.\nThe following subsections characterize the equilibrium properties of\nthe model and show the following. Equilibria exist and are constrained\nefficient.

Papers by Peters (1991,\n1997, 2000) and Burdett et al.

A brief graphical illustration is presented\nfirst to clarify the main working of the model and the main results. The\nformal proofs follow.\nB. Graphical Illustration\nIn this model, workers and firms care about two things: the wage w and\neffective queue length m. Therefore, the equilibrium interaction can be\nillustrated in the two-dimensional plane of figure 1 that resembles an\nEdgeworth box. Firms prefer points with a low wage w and a high(w, m)\neffective queue length m (northwest) and workers prefer the opposite\n(southeast).\nWorkers\u2019 preferences can best be represented by two sets of indiffer-\nence curves. First, if they send a single application, their expected utility\nis given by (15). Recalling that is the probability of being\u0001m(1 \u0001 e )\/m\nhired, we can write an indifference curve according to (15) as [(1 \u0001\n. This describes all combinations of m and w that yield net\u0001me )\/m]wp u 1\nutility level for a low application (where is net of the applicationu u1 1\ncost). The curve in figure 1 corresponds to a particular value ofIC 1\n. Even workers who send two applications and obtain an expectedu 1\n882 journal of political economy\nutility according to (16) have such indifference curves over the low wage\n, because the part associated with the low wage is still the product ofw1\nthe wage times the probability of being hired.\nSecond, workers have a separate set of indifference curves for their\nhigh application. If they can obtain utility for their low application,u 1\nthen the indifference curve for according to (16) isw 2\n\u0001m \u0001m1 \u0001 e 1 \u0001 e\nw \u0002 1 \u0001 u p u .1 2( )m m\nThe curve in figure 1 describes all combinations of m and w thatIC 2\ngive a particular net utility (net of application costs and conditionalu 2\non the first application yielding ). In other words, a worker whou 1\nobtains a point on with one application and a point on with hisIC IC1 2\nother application achieves net utility with his low application and netu 1\nutility overall.u 2\nNote that is steeper than because workers who fail to get aIC IC2 1\nhigh-wage job still anticipate a chance of getting a job at the low wage.\nThe low-wage application induces a fallback option that makes workers\nmore risky with their high-wage application.21 Further, note that when\nall workers optimize according to equilibrium condition 2a, the resulting\nutilities and fully determine the queue lengths, which are givenu u1 2\nby the upper contour of the associated indifference curves andIC IC1 2\n(the dashed line). If there would be a wage\u2013queue length combination\nbelow the dashed line, workers could raise their utility beyond oru 1\nby applying there.u 2\nFigure 1 also represents the iso-profit curves of the firms. Firms care\nabout effective applications but not whether they come from high or\nlow applications. Therefore, they have only one set of iso-profit curves,\ngiven by equation (14): . The curves and\u0001m \u0302(1 \u0001 e )(1 \u0001 w)p p IP IP\ndepict such iso-profit curves for different profit levels and . The\u02c6p\u00af p\nproblem of an individual firm can now be understood as follows: The\nfirm anticipates that workers can obtain utilities ( , ) elsewhere, andu u1 2\nit can therefore predict that the relationship between its wage offer and\nits effective queue length is given by the dashed line. Therefore, it looks\nfor a point on the dashed line associated with the highest iso-profit\ncurve.\nFrom figure 1 one can infer the following three results: First, whenever\nsome workers send multiple applications, there has to be wage disper-\nsion. The reason is the following. If firms offer only a single wage, then\n21 Figure 1 is also related to models of on-the-job search, such as Delacroix and Shi\n(2005). Here different wage segments arise because workers who fail at the high wage\nstill have the hope of getting a job at the low wage. In on-the-job search models, workers\nwho fail at a higher wage still have their current job.\nefficiency of simultaneous search 883\nworkers will send both applications there because of a lack of alterna-\ntives. The indifference curves and will adjust such that the offeredIC IC1 2\nwage is exactly at the intersection of both curves, indicated by point\n( ) in figure 1. The associated iso-profit curve for firms is . Noww\u00af, m IP\u00af\nit is easy to see that no firm would individually offer wage at the \u201ckink\u201dw\u00af\nof the dashed line. The \u201ckink\u201d induces a nonconvexity into the firm\u2019s\nproblem, and an individual firm can obtain a higher level of utility by\nchoosing a different wage, say , and obtain the associated queuew 2\nlength given by the dashed line. This combination is on the higher iso-\nprofit curve , indicating a profitable deviation from the unique marketI\u0302P\nwage. Second, the figure highlights the inefficiencies that would be\nassociated with a unique wage (similar to lemma 2) since all pointsw\u00af\nbetween the indifference curves and and the iso-profit curveIP IP IP1 2\nwould be strictly preferred by both workers and firms. The presence of\nthese inefficiencies at a unique wage is exactly what induces firms to\ndeviate and reduce these inefficiencies. Third, when there are two wages,\nand , the associated iso-profit curve can be tangent to the\u0302w w IP1 2\nindifference curves, which sustains an equilibrium and yields efficiency\n(similar to lemma 1).22\nC. Equilibrium Analysis\nThe formal analysis proceeds in three steps. First, the workers\u2019 search\nbehavior for a given distribution of wages and a given number of ap-\nplications is analyzed. Then the firms\u2019 wage-setting decisions are con-\nsidered. Finally, entry of firms and the equilibrium number of appli-\ncations are determined.\nThe workers\u2019 search decisions.\u2014For the moment, fix the fraction ofg1\nworkers who send one application, the fraction who send two appli-g2\ncations, and the number v of firms. All agents take as given the effective\nqueue lengths and associated trading probabilities andm(w) p(w) h(w)\nthat arise in equilibrium and maximize their payoffs according to equi-\nlibrium condition 2a. Workers who send only one application solve the\nproblem\nmax p(w)w. (17)\nw\nLet be the value of program (17).

Since the terms related tow \u2264 w1 2\nwage enter the optimization problem only multiplicatively and ad-w 2\nditively, it is clear that the optimal choice of also solves programw1\n(17). Workers with two applications behave with their low application\nas workers with only one application. Therefore, program (18) reduces\nto\nmax {p(w )w \u0002 [1 \u0001 p(w )]u }. (19)2 2 2 1\nw2\nLet be the value of program (19), that is, the highest expected netu 2\nutility that workers with two applications can obtain. Since the combi-\nnation of any wage that solves (19) and any that solves (17)w w2 1\ntogether solve (18) but solving (18) requires , there must existw \u2264 w1 2\na wage such that any solution to (19) is weakly below and any\u00af \u00afw w\nsolution to (17) is weakly above .w\u00af\nSo far we considered only the optimization by individual workers.\nNow we use the fact that every worker optimizes according to the steps\noutlined above. Therefore, in the subgame after the wage announce-\nments, workers will apply in a way that endogenously generates a cutoff\nwage such that below this wage workers send their low applicationw\u00af\nand above this wage they send their high application. By the market\nutility condition they do this for wages that are offered by many firms\nas well as for those that are offered only by an individual deviant. We\ntherefore obtain the next proposition, which is formally proven in the\nAppendix.\nProposition 1 (Workers\u2019 application behavior).

It is relatively straightforward\nto show that as long as some workers send some application, the firms\ndo not offer the extreme wages of zero or one, so .23 An individualw\u00af ! 1\nfirm maximizes subject to (20), (21), and (22), which\u0001m(w)[1 \u0001 e ](1 \u0001 w)\ndescribe the effective queue length at each wage. Since the effective\nqueue length is strictly increasing in the wage, the constraints specify a\none-to-one relationship when the queue length is strictly positive. There-\nfore, the firm can first choose the queue length it wants to obtain and\nthen post the associated wage that induces workers to apply as desired.\nUsing the constraints to substitute out the wage from the firm\u2019s objective,\nwe can write the firm\u2019s profits as a function of the desired effective\nqueue length, that is, withP(m(w)) :p p(w)\n\u0001mP(m)p 1 \u0001 e \u0001 mu G m \u0001 [0, m] (23)\u00af1\nand\n\u0001mP(m)p (1 \u0001 e )(1 \u0001 u ) \u0001 m(u \u0001 u ) G m \u0001 [m, m(1)], (24)\u00af1 2 1\nwhere .

Given and\u0001m2e )\/m v2 1\n25 In most work on wage dispersion with homogeneous agents, a unique wage cannot\nbe sustained because of the following discontinuity: a firm\u2019s offer at a slightly higher wage\nis accepted for sure, whereas at the market wage there is a chance that a worker would\nrather accept an equally good offer from a competing firm (see Burdett and Judd 1983;\nBurdett and Mortensen 1998; Acemog\u02d8lu and Shimer 2000; Gautier and Moraga-Gonza\u00b4lez\n2005; Galenianos and Kircher 2008). In this model, a worker anticipates that at a higher\nwage other workers accept with a higher probability, which means that other applications\nare effective with a higher probability. This is bad for the worker. Thus, he applies only\nif the overall number of (gross) applications goes down. This reduction in applications\nsmooths out the discontinuity in acceptances. Dispersion arises nevertheless because work-\ners trade off the wage and the queue length differently for high and low applications,\nleading to a discontinuity in the derivative (i.e., the \u201ckink\u201d), which suffices to induce\ndispersion.\nefficiency of simultaneous search 887\n, is uniquely determined, and so is by (26). Substituting (26)v m u2 2 1\nand (25) into (23) and (24) yields the following proposition.\nProposition 3 (Profits and wages).

(30)2 \u0001m21 \u0001 e\nProfits and wages have a natural interpretation: The profit of a firm\nreflects its marginal contribution to matching, as explained already in\nthe discussion of the search efficiency condition (8). Similarly, the for-\nmulas for the wages can be understood by considering the incentives\nthat they provide for the workers. The low wage coincides with the\nprobability that an additional application for this wage reaches a\u0001m1e\nfirm that has no other effective applicant, conditional on the event that\na worker actually gets hired at this wage, which happens with probability\n. The conditioning is important because the decision\u0001m1p p (1 \u0001 e )\/m1 1\nto send an application is influenced by the product of hiring probability\nand wage, and so provides incentives that coincide with the socialp w1 1\nbenefit. At the high wage, the social benefit of sending another appli-\ncation is the probability that it reaches a high-wage firm that does\u0001m2e\nnot have another applicant, adjusted by the probability that the\u0001m11 \u0001 e\nlow-wage firm to which the worker also applied has at least one other\napplicant (otherwise no new match is created). The high wage reflects\nthis social benefit (again conditional on getting matched to provide the\nright incentives) and adds a term reflecting the social benefit of the low\napplication. The reason for the added term is that conditional on getting\nthe high-wage job, the worker is precluded from reaping the benefits\nfrom his application for the low-wage job and has to be compensated\nfor this.\nIf no worker sends two applications, then the arguments above easily\nestablish that only one wage is offered ( ). The determination ofv p 02\nthe wage is identical to the low wage in the previous proposition; that\n888 journal of political economy\nis, it is determined by (28) and induces profits given by (27). Given that\nworkers apply only once, any offer leads to a hire, and therefore\n.m p l1 1\nEquilibrium outcomes.\u2014Before we turn to the full equilibrium, it is\ninstructive to consider the case with exogenous search intensity g. The\nfollowing lemma will cover the case with and without free entry.\nConsider the case in which some workers apply twice. Firms offer two\nwages but have to make equal profits. Equating profits and inP P1 2\n(27) and (29), we obtain exactly the same allocation as in the planners\u2019\noptimum in (8). If the number of firms is not fixed, free entry implies\n\u0001m \u0001m1 11 \u0001 e \u0001 m e p K (31)1\nand\n\u0001m \u0001m \u0001m2 2 1(1 \u0001 e \u0001 m e )(1 \u0001 e )p K, (32)2\nwhich coincide with conditions (10) and (11) that uniquely determine\nthe optimal entry level.26 We get the following efficiency results when\ntaking the search intensity of workers as given, which include the well-\nknown results for one-application models as the special case of g p1\n.1\nLemma 3. Given search intensity (g0, g1, g2), with , theg \u0002 g 1 01 2\nfollowing conditions hold:\n1. Given entry , there exists unique tuple that fulfillsv 1 0 (F, G , G )1 2\nthe appropriate equilibrium conditions 1a, 2a, and 3, and it yields\nthe search efficient number of matches.\n2. With free entry, there exists unique tuple that fulfills(v, F, G , G )1 2\nthe appropriate equilibrium conditions 1a, 1b, 2a, and 3, and it\nyields optimal entry.\nNow consider the equilibrium when the fraction of agents that send\nzero, one, or two applications is endogenous. The free-entry conditions\n(31) and (32) determine the effective queue lengths at the high- and\nlow-wage firms solely as a function of the exogenous entry cost K.

The\n26 By construction, there are not profitable deviations from this profile: firms are willing\nto offer these wages since the wages were determined by the appropriate first-order con-\nditions, and in each region the maximization problem is concave. Workers are willing to\napply in this fashion because we used their indifference conditions (21) and (22) to\nconstruct firm profits.\nefficiency of simultaneous search 889\nequilibrium is determined by comparing these marginal gains with the\nmarginal costs of sending the application.\nProposition 4 (Equilibrium outcomes). An equilibrium exists and\nis constrained efficient. Furthermore, the following conditions hold:\n1. For , in the unique equilibrium, no firm enters and no ap-c 1 u*1 1\nplication is sent.\n2. For and , in the unique equilibrium, all workersc ! u* c 1 u* \u0001 u*1 1 2 2 1\nsend one application and one wage is offered.\n3. For and , in the unique equilibrium, all workersc ! u* c ! u* \u0001 u*1 1 2 2 1\nsend two applications, two wages are offered, and each worker ap-\nplies to one firm offering each wage.\nThe key reason for uniqueness is that firms anticipate that workers\nwill send additional applications when they offer high wages (this is\ncaptured by the market utility condition). Even if in (a candidate) equi-\nlibrium only one wage is offered and workers send only one application,\na firm that deviates and offers a sufficiently high wage expects that\nworkers will send a second application for this very high wage. It is this\nfeature that leads to a high queue length for a deviant with a high wage\nand makes such a deviation profitable whenever the marginal cost isc 2\nbelow the marginal benefit .u* \u0001 u*2 1\nEfficiency follows trivially because the marginal utilities andu*1\nequal the planner\u2019s thresholds and .

When workers apply only once ( , which arisesg p 02\nwhen is large), the distinction between effective and gross queuec 2\nlength disappears, and wages (28) and profits (27) replicate the standard\nresult from one-application models such as that of Burdett et al. (2001).\nThe introduction of a second application changes the equilibrium and\nessentially generates two markets. The profits in each are given by\n\u0001m \u0001mi iP p (1 \u0001 e \u0001 m e )(1 \u0001 u ).

In\nthe high-wage market ( ), the rejection probability is zero, butip 2 u 1\n890 journal of political economy\nis greater than zero since it reflects the workers\u2019 endogenous outside\noption induced by the low-wage market. Apart from these spillovers,\neach market operates as a single one-application market.\nThis separation into semiseparate markets arises because of a close\nresemblance of our setup to a sequential market with two periods:27 A\nfirm that pays K can choose one of the periods and post a wage. Workers\nwho pay can participate in both periods, and workers who payc(2)\nparticipate in the second period. Workers who fail to get a job inc(1)\nthe first period try again in the second. In the second period workers\nhave nothing to wait for and maximize according to (17), whereas in\nthe first period they anticipate the benefit from waiting and maximizeu 1\naccording to (19). The main difference from our model is that in this\nsequential setup a first-period firm can attract applicants at wages below\nwhereas in our setup such wages would attract only low applicationsw\u00af\n(i.e., second-period applications). The reason is that workers from the\nsecond period would drive up the queue length if they could apply to\nsuch a firm.28 Nevertheless, a firm that wanted to offer such low wages\nis better off waiting for the second period, and in equilibrium the out-\ncome of the two economies coincides. Our interaction therefore resem-\nbles the nonstationary sequential search in Peters (1991), and efficiency\nis driven by reasons similar to those in standard sequential one-appli-\ncation interactions (even though I am not aware of a formal efficiency\nproof for the nonstationary environment).29\nV. Generalization to N 1 2 Applications\nIn this section the restriction that workers can send no more than two\napplications will be dispensed with. This allows us to consider the limit\nas search costs vanish and to examine whether the equilibrium converges\nto the unconstrained efficient Walrasian outcome, as opposed to the\nconstrained efficient social planner\u2019s outcome. This limit is of interest\nbecause, typically, search models that approach Walrasian outcomes rely\non repeated interactions, whereas most static search models converge\nto non-Walrasian outcomes even when costs vanish (e.g., Acemog\u02d8lu and\nShimer 2000; Albrecht et al. 2006). The main reasons why convergence\nmight not be immediate is that the miscoordination and tie-breaking\nfrictions may not vanish and that the total application costs may not\nconverge to zero. The latter could happen if the vanishing costs are\n27 I thank the editor for suggesting this connection to me.\n28 Since both applications can be sent to firms with low wages, our cutoff wage is w\u00afp\n(see proposition 1). In a sequential interaction, a first-period firm gets appli-2u \/(2u \u0001 u )1 1 2\ncations as long as the wage is larger than .w\u02c6p u2\n29 In fact, because of the equivalence of the equilibrium outcomes, this proof can be\nregarded as an efficiency proof for nonstationary sequential directed search environments.\nefficiency of simultaneous search 891\noffset by an increasing number of applications that workers send. In\nthe following it will be shown that convergence to the Walrasian bench-\nmark does arise in this model.\nAdditionally, even away from the limit it might be interesting to have\na simple representation of the search intensity and resulting matches.\nIt has been argued that explicit forms of search intensity based on\nsimultaneous search can be useful to understand the response of workers\nto varying labor market conditions (e.g., Shimer 2004), and we will see\nthat the formulation in a directed search framework like this one re-\nmains particularly tractable. This framework is thus potentially useful\nfor the study of such wider questions.\nFor the analysis, recall that for some , which togetherc(i) 1 0 i \u0001 \u0001\nwith increasing marginal costs implies a largest integer, denoted N, such\nthat . Clearly, it is neither individually nor socially optimal toc(N ) \u2264 1\nsend more than N applications because the application costs would\nexceed the value created in a match. Thus, the number of applications\nper individual remains bounded. Apart from the larger number of pos-\nsible applications that each worker is allowed to send, the model remains\nunchanged. The exact equilibrium definition for this extended setup\nis presented in the Appendix.\nThe equilibrium characterization extends by analogy to the previous\nsection, as shown in the Appendix. The workers again partition the\nwages into intervals related to each of their applications. The equilib-\nrium interaction in each interval corresponds to that in the one-appli-\ncation case, again with the adjustment that the workers\u2019 \u201coutside option\u201d\nincorporates the expected utility that can be obtained at lower wages,\nwhereas the queue length incorporates the fact that some applicants\nare lost to higher-wage firms. Again, the free-entry condition defines\nthe effective queue length in the various wage segments that arises in\nequilibrium. In particular,\n\u0001m* \u0001m*i i(1 \u0001 e \u0001 m*e )(1 \u0001 u* )p K (34)i i\u00011\nand\n\u0001m*iu*p e (1 \u0001 u* ) \u0002 u* (35)i i\u00011 i\u00011\nrecursively define the effective queue length and marginal utilitym*i\nat the ith-highest wage as a function of entry cost K, given initialu*i\ncondition .

Efficiency ob-\ntains again for similar reasons, the only difference being that now i*\nwages are necessary to obtain the optimal allocation in the search\nprocess.\nConvergence to the competitive outcome.\u2014Now consider the case in which\napplication costs become small. In the following it will be shown that\nthe equilibrium allocation converges to the unconstrained efficient al-\nlocation of a competitive economy. A competitive Walrasian economy\nachieves the following benchmark allocation: Since entry costs are below\nthe productivity of a match, firms enter until the measure of firms equals\nthe measure of workers, that is, all workers and all firms get matched.\nSince free entry places firms on the long side of the market, firms are\njust compensated for their entry cost K. The market wage is then 1 \u0001\nand coincides with the utility of each worker.K\nConsider a sequence of cost functions such that the marginal cost of\nthe ith application converges pointwise to zero for all . Ratheri \u0001 \u0001\nthan looking at these functions directly, it is convenient to simply con-\nsider the associated equilibrium number of applications that eachi*\nworker sends.31 Vanishing costs amount to . Let denote thei* r \u0003 v(i*)\nequilibrium measure of active firms, and andh(i*)p h(w)dF j(i*)p\u222b\ndenote the average probability of being matched for both av(i*)h(i*)\nfirm and a worker in the economy, respectively.

In the Appendix the following proposition is\nproved.\nProposition 6 (Convergence). The equilibrium outcome con-\nverges to the competitive outcome, that is,\n31 For the (nongeneric) case of multiple equilibria, select for simplicity one in which\nall workers send the same number of applications; and when multiple cost functions sustain\nthe same equilibrium number of applications, consider a subsequence of cost functions\nthat includes only one of these.\nefficiency of simultaneous search 893\nlim v(i*)p 1,\n\u2217i r\u0003\nlim h(i*)p lim j(i*)p 1,\n\u2217 \u2217i r\u0003 i r\u0003\nlim w(i*)p lim U *(i*)p 1 \u0001 K.\n\u2217 \u2217i r\u0003 i r\u0003\nThe structure of the proof uses the intuition for the competitive\neconomy: For a given measure v of active firms, the competitive economy\nimplies that (only) the long side of the market gets rationed and the\nshort side appropriates all surplus.

Despite the fact that workers send more applications, their ap-1 \u0001 K\nplication costs vanish faster than the increase in the number of appli-\ncations, and therefore their utility equals the wage of in the limit.1 \u0001 K\nIt may be instructive to point out how the equilibrium converges to\nthe competitive solution. The equilibrium wages are implicitly de-wi\ntermined by (34) and (35) without regard to the application costs.\nTherefore, the wages and that were derived in Section IV are stillw w1 2\noffered even as workers send more and more applications, and also\ntheir effective queue lengths remain the same. But as workers apply\nmore often, higher wages are added. It becomes more and more likely\nthat a worker gets hired at high wages, which means that the same\neffective queue length at a low wage requires only very few firms to offer\nthis wage because only very few workers will be effective at this wage.\nThe support of the wages does not converge, yet the mass of agents that\ntrade at wages away from converges to zero.1 \u0001 K\nVI. Discussion\nIn the introduction it is mentioned that other simultaneous search en-\nvironments do not obtain efficiency. This section highlights the driving\nforces toward efficiency in the model and discusses how these differ\nrelative to the earlier literature.\nConvergence to the Walrasian benchmark.\u2014In most search models, adding\nan additional worker to the economy makes it harder for other workers\nto find a job and easier for the firms to hire a worker. The same is true\nin this setup when a worker sends two applications instead of one. When\napplication costs vanish and many more applications are sent, the pro-\ncess becomes so efficient that in the limit the short side of the market\ngets matched for sure. This is a minimal requirement for convergence\n894 journal of political economy\ntoward the efficient outcome. The right incentives for efficient entry of\nfirms then follow from the competitive nature of the wage setting.\nIn the models by Gautier and Moraga-Gonza\u00b4lez (2005), Albrecht et\nal. (2006), and Galenianos and Kircher (2008), it may become harder\nfor firms to hire when workers send a second application. In their en-\nvironments every firm makes only one offer, so if some worker sends\ntwo applications, two firms might both offer a job to him and only one\ncan hire him even if both had other applicants. This introduces non-\nnegligible probabilities that firms cannot hire. Therefore, the short side\nof the market does not get perfectly matched even in the limit, killing\nthe central driving force toward the Walrasian benchmark. In Acemog\u02d8lu\nand Shimer (2000), workers can sample information about multiple\nwages but can apply to only one firm, again precluding convergence to\nthe case in which the short side gets matched for sure.\nEfficient \u201cpricing\u201d under nonnegligible costs.\u2014Constrained efficiency in\nthis model arises because firms can \u201cprice\u201d the good they are interested\nin: the hiring probability, which is determined by the queue of effective\napplications. They can \u201cprice\u201d the effective applications despite the\nproblem that they cannot pay the workers directly for their applications\nto other firms, which was mentioned as \u201ccontractual incompleteness\u201d\nin the introduction. This incompleteness is solved because workers in-\nternalize the actions of other workers: Workers care only about rival\napplicants who are effective, that is, those who do not get jobs at higher\nwages. Only such applicants make it difficult to get a job at any wage.\nIf some workers who apply to firm A also apply to a better firm B, other\nworkers anticipate this and apply more to firm A because they under-\nstand that (because of the applications to B) there is now less compe-\ntition for A\u2019s job. In general, if a firm changes its wage, workers change\ntheir application behavior such that the queue of effective applications\nrises until they are indifferent between this wage and the other wages\noffered in the market. This allows firms to price the effective applications\nat the margin and to achieve efficiency.\nIt might be surprising that rent seeking does not cause inefficiencies\nin this setup. Rent seeking arises when workers send more applications\njust to get a better wage even when the productivity of the jobs does\nnot differ. It is pervasive in models with wage dispersion (see, e.g., Acem-\nog\u02d8lu and Shimer 2000; Gautier, Moraga-Gonza\u00b4lez, and Wolthoff 2008).\nIt arises when search is not fully directed, that is, wages are not publicly\nposted. The missing competition leads to wages that do not reflect the\nmarginal value of an application. In contrast, in the setting analyzed\nhere, wages are posted and do reflect the marginal value of an appli-\ncation. As mentioned at the end of Section IV, one can interpret our\nmarket interaction as a sequential process, where firms and workers at\nhigh wages trade first, and those workers who did not get matched\nefficiency of simultaneous search 895\nproceed to the next period, where matching occurs at the next-lower\nwage. In each period the workers take into account their option of\nmatching later, and the wage setting \u201cprices\u201d their applications correctly,\ntaking into account the waiting option.32\nIn earlier directed search models by Albrecht et al. (2006) and Gal-\nenianos and Kircher (2008), firms are not able to \u201cprice\u201d their hiring\nprobability because of the lack of stability in the final matching. Recall\nthat a lack of stability means that a firm might not be able to hire any\nworker even though one of its workers obtains only a lower-wage job or\nremains unemployed. Firms still want to price effective applications, but\nin these models the workers regard the wage as the price for gross\napplications. Any gross application has an equal chance of getting an\noffer, and even if the worker decides to work elsewhere, the job is\n\u201cblocked\u201d because the firms can make only a single offer. So workers\nview any gross application as competition. If a firm raises its wage, work-\ners raise their gross applications until they are indifferent to applying\nelsewhere. Workers might also change their application behavior to other\nfirms. Since this second effect is not directly influenced by the offered\nwage, the firms cannot price their hiring probability (the effective ap-\nplications) and efficiency does not obtain. In terms of the sequential\ninterpretation, workers who get jobs already in early rounds at high-\nwage firms still apply in later periods at low-wage firms, which disturbs\nthe pricing at these lower-wage firms.\nThis distinction between gross and effective applications has not been\nconsidered in the literature because the two notions coincide in models\nin which workers have only one application: With one application no\nworker rejects an offer, and every application is effective.33 Our model\nincludes the one-application environment when the first application is\nfree but all others are prohibitively expensive. More important, even\nwith multiple applications, each wage segment is similar to the one-\napplication model. In particular, the Hosios (1990) condition, which\nties the division of the match surplus to the elasticity of the matching\nfunction and ensures that private and social surplus in the market co-\nincide, holds per wage segment once the appropriate notion of effective\napplications is applied (see eq. [33]). Therefore, earlier results on ef-\nficient entry in one-application models naturally extend to our setup.\nTwo main assumptions: i. Perfect recall.\u2014In the interpretation of the\n32 Note that the real \u201cprice\u201d is the product of the wage and the probability of being\nhired. This product is lower at high wages. This reflects the fact that the social value of\nsending two applications instead of one is lower than the social value of sending one\napplication instead of none.\n33 This also holds for models that incorporate search intensity in a more reduced-form\nway through a scalar that increases the matching probability but yields at most one job\nat a time (see, e.g., Moen 1995).\n896 journal of political economy\nfinal matching stage as an extensive form process, one might ask how\nmany applicants a firm can possibly contact. The model requires that\na firm can potentially contact all of them. If a firm can contact only a\nlimited number M of applicants, it bears the risk that they all are hired\nelsewhere. Again, firms care about effective applicants who would accept\nthe job, but workers anticipate that even noneffective applicants can\n\u201cblock\u201d a job if there are more than M of them. Since pricing works\nthrough the workers\u2019 reaction, firms are not able to price their hiring\nprobability efficiently, similar to the reason discussed above for the\ncase of Albrecht et al. (2006) and Galenianos and Kircher (2008).Mp 1\nFor larger M, we expect the inefficiencies to be less severe, but full\nefficiency is likely to arise only when all applicants can be contacted.\nii. Wage commitment.\u2014Wage commitment is important because it de-\ntermines the terms of trade in a competitive manner before the market\nsplits into small groups in which market forces are absent. In the the-\noretical analysis, wage commitment has the additional advantage of al-\nlowing for a particularly tractable notion of stability, enabling us to\nanalytically study the earlier stages of firm entry, wage setting, and ap-\nplication behavior. The assumption of wage commitment might be par-\nticularly applicable in markets in which large firms adopt wage policies\nuniformly for the entire organization rather than adjust them to each\nindividual bargaining situation. It seems also reasonable when the\n\u201cwage\u201d offers are interpreted more broadly as investments into prestige\nor amenities that are valued by the workers but cannot easily be adapted.\nIt also applies when working conditions, including wages, are specified\nin advance of the application and matching process, as in the U.S.\nmarket for medical residents.34\nSince other environments might not feature full commitment, it\nwould be interesting to investigate forms of adjustments of the wage\nannouncement in response to the application conditions that each firm\nand worker face. In particular, a low-wage firm that attracts several work-\ners might be happy that it offered a low wage because it is likely that\none of its workers gets no higher offer, whereas a low-wage firm that\nattracts only a single worker might prefer to raise its offer to a higher\nlevel to be sure that the worker accepts. Similarly, in an extensive form\n34 Roth (1984, 995\u201396) points out that in this market hospitals specify the job require-\nments and wages; then residents have to apply to and interview with hospitals; finally, both\nsides of the market submit rankings of those partners with whom they have interviewed to a\nclearinghouse that produces a stable matching. While this paper is targeted to general\njob markets and might not reflect the details of this specific market\u2014in particular, it\nneglects heterogeneities\u2014it highlights the efficiency even with a decentralized application\nprocedure.\nBulow and Levin (2006) analyze price setting prior to matching in a world with one-\nsided heterogeneity but abstract from decentralized applications by assuming that all\nresidents apply to all hospitals.\nefficiency of simultaneous search 897\nin which firms contact their workers sequentially, a firm might want to\nraise its wage offer once it approaches the last worker in order to increase\nthe odds that the worker accepts. Weakening commitment by intro-\nducing methods for adjusting the terms of trade after the applications\nare sent might change the results regarding efficiency.35 Especially if the\nprobability that wages are adjusted upward is not balanced by propor-\ntionally lower wage offers ex ante, then entry of firms will not be effi-\ncient. Unfortunately, wage adjustments introduce strategic elements into\nthe final matching stage, and the feedback to earlier stages renders such\nanalysis beyond the scope of this paper.\nHeterogeneity.\u2014So far this paper abstracted from heterogeneities.\nWhile perfect recall and commitment seem essential for efficiency, ho-\nmogeneity is clearly not essential. Consider the easiest case in which\nworkers differ in their cost of sending applications. Equations (31) and\n(32) still describe the queue lengths due to free entry, so the marginal\nbenefit for each worker still coincides with his social benefit; that is,\napplication behavior remains constrained efficient. While so far it was\nassumed that firms produce unit of output, consider now thexp 1\ncase in which firms may choose to enter at different levels of productivity\nx at some cost that is increasing and convex as in Acemog\u02d8lu andK(x)\nShimer (1999) or Shi (2001). Equations (31) and (32) for optimal entry\ncan be easily adjusted to this case, and efficiency is relatively straight-\nforward to establish.36 Firms at the high wage invest in more capital\nbecause they are more likely to utilize it. Also, if the workers are het-\nerogeneous as in Shi (2001) or Shimer (2005) and wages can be con-\nditioned on productivity, it seems likely that efficiency still arises because\nthe interaction in each wage segment closely resembles a one-application\neconomy and is likely to inherit its efficiency properties even in broader\nenvironments.\n35 In Albrecht et al. (2006), firms\u2019 wage announcements are not complete commitments,\nbut firms bid up the wage to the worker\u2019s marginal product if two firms make an offer\nto the same worker. This has the effect that workers are mainly interested in two offers\neven if the announced wages are very low, which contributes to depressed wage offers\nand excessive entry.\n36 The workers\u2019 problem is still unchanged, and given utility levels and , a low-wageu u1 2\nfirm solves subject to the workers\u2019 response\u0001mmax (1\u0001 e )(x\u0001 w)\u0001 K(x) w(1\u0001w,m,x\n.

Conclusion\nThis paper incorporates a microfoundation for search intensity into the\ndirected search framework by allowing workers to apply to multiple firms\nsimultaneously. Application choices can be interpreted as the strategic\nbut frictional formation of links in a network between workers and\nfirms,37 and the number of links of each worker captures his search\nintensity. We resolve the assignment of jobs as a stable matching on the\nnetwork, which allows the wages to internalize all the externalities that\nare present in earlier stages even when application costs are nonnegli-\ngible. The economy converges to the unconstrained efficient Walrasian\noutcome as application costs vanish.\nAppendix\nBefore proceeding to the main proofs, it will be convenient to prove an auxiliary\nresult for the social planner\u2019s problem.

By construction, all queue lengths at locations such that\u2032\u2032 \u2032\u2032l \u0001 L l 1\nare identical under and since the number of firms and\u2032 \u2032 \u2032l {F, G , G } {F , G , G }1 2 1 2\nthe application behavior are unchanged (and the matching at higher locations\n37 The large literature in network formation usually deploys solution concepts that elim-\ninate any randomness on which a frictional nature of unemployment could be based\nbecause they require that no (pair of) individuals would choose links differently ex post\nafter the network has been realized (see, e.g., Dutta and Jackson 2000; Jackson 2005).\nOur equilibrium notion requires only ex ante optimality before applications are sent out\nand uses miscoordination between workers in their link formation to retain frictions in\nthe spirit of the search literature on unemployment.\n38 That is, the mass points f and g coincide at all (combination of) locations that do\nnot involve l or with and , i.e., , , and\u2032 \u2032 \u2032 \u2032 \u2032 \u2032l f g f(l )p f (l ) g (l )p g (l ) g (l , l )p g (l , l )a a 1 a 1 a 2 a b 2 a b\nfor all , .

Now consider\nthe matching at all locations in L that are weakly larger than either l or .\u2032l\nAssume that . That means that among the firms at these locations,\u2032 \u2032m p m 1 m\u2032l l l\nunder strictly more get matched than under m. On the other hand, it becomes\u2032m\nstrictly harder for workers to get an offer, and strictly fewer workers get matched\nat these locations. Since workers and firms are matched in pairs, we cannot\nobtain more matches for firms than for workers. Similarly, can be\u2032 \u2032m p m ! m\u2032l l l\nruled out. Therefore, .\u2032 \u2032m p m p m\u2032l l l\nThat means that we have not changed the overall matching probabilities at\nany of the locations, because firms at a location below face exactly the samel\u0001 1\nprobabilities that their workers take other jobs as under the original assignment.\nSince the matching probabilities are not changed, the number of matches is\nidentical.

This induces a new on with\u2032 \u2032 \u2032 \u2032l\u0001 1 {F , G , G } L p L\u222a {l\u0001 1}1 2\nassociated and .40 Note that the number of firms or applications at any\u2032 \u2032f g\nlocation other than l has not changed, and therefore can be obtained{F, G , G }1 2\nfrom by merging l and (see the discussion for lemma A1). We\u2032 \u2032 \u2032{F , G , G } l\u0001 11 2\nhave one degree of freedom left: we are free to choose the fraction r of firms\nthat remain at location l; that is, we choose and\u2032 \u2032f (l\u0001 1)p (1\u0001 r)f(l) f (l)p\n. Now it will be shown that for an appropriate choice of r the queue lengthsrf(l)\n39 Let L be restricted to consist only of those locations l that have a positive measure of\nfirms and receive a positive measure of workers, i.e., that are in the support of F and of\nor .

Therefore, the\naverage probability that a worker who sends his application to and to al\u0001 1\nlocation strictly above l gets the high location offer is unchanged. The result\nthat there exists r such that then follows by the intermediate value\u2032 \u2032m p ml\u00011 l\ntheorem because the number of applications per firm goes to infinity at l when\nthe fraction r of firms is close to zero, whereas it goes to infinity at whenl\u0001 1\nr is close to one.41 Therefore, the separation of low and high applications leaves\nthe overall number of matches unchanged under appropriate r by lemma A1.\nTo finish step 1, repeat the previous argument successively for all locations.\nThis leaves us with a set of locations receiving low applications{1, 3, \u2026 , 2FLF\u0001 1}\nand a set of locations receiving high applications and an un-{2, 4, \u2026 , 2FLF}\nchanged number of matches in the economy. We can now relabel the locations\nsuch that any location receiving low or single applications is below any location\nreceiving high applications without changing the number of matches.

By lemma A1 this impliesl\u0001 {1, \u2026 , FLF}\nthat we can successively merge these locations into a single location without\nreducing the optimal number of matches.\n41 Formally, let be the measure of workers sending one application\u02dca (l)p g \u0001 g (l, l)\n\u02dcH 2 2l(l\nto l and one strictly below, let be the measure of workers\u02dca (l)p g g (l)\u0002 g \u0001 g (l, l)\n\u02dcL 1 1 2 2l(l\nsending one application to l and the other strictly higher, and let be thea (l)p g (l, l)B 2\nmeasure of workers who send both applications to l.

Every worker who applies{FLF\u0002 1, \u2026 , 2FLF}\nthere also applies to the low location. Matching more workers already at the\nhigh locations makes it easier for every remaining worker at the low location\nto obtain a job. Therefore, maximizing the number of matches at {FLF\u0002 1,\nalso maximizes the number of matches overall. At the high locations\u2026 , 2FLF}\nthe gross and the effective queue lengths coincide. By the strict concavity of\n, the average matching probability at high-location firms is maximized if\u0001l1\u0001 e\nthe gross queue length is identical for all of them. This result is well known\n(e.g., Shimer 2005) and follows by the same logic as in the previous paragraph\nonly that we do not have to worry about the probability that a worker is not\navailable. Therefore, by lemma A1, these locations can be merged into one\nlocation without loss of optimality.\nThis leaves us with two locations, one that attracts only low (and single)\napplications and one that attracts only high applications, and either we have\nnot changed the number of matches compared to those arising from {F, G ,1\nor we have improved on them.

QED\nProof of Proposition 4\nIt will first be shown that an equilibrium without entry exists if , whereasc 1 u*1 1\nit does not exist if . Consider some (candidate) equilibrium without entry,c ! u*1 1\nthat is, , sustained by some function for the effective queue length.vp 0 m(7)\nThe function represents the firm\u2019s conjecture about the applications it wouldm(7)\nreceive if it entered.

Therefore, as-\nsume that an equilibrium with exists (as will be shown below). Since isv 1 0 u*1\nthe marginal utility at the low wage under free entry, all workers will apply at\nleast once since . The question is whether a high wage will also be offered.u* 1 c1 1\nLet us assume that only one wage is offered and workers send only one appli-\ncation. Workers do not want to deviate if it is not profitable to send another\napplication to the offered wage (because at other wages the queue length is\n904 journal of political economy\ndetermined by their indifference by the market utility condition). It can be\nshown that a worker would deviate only if , which is\u0001m* \u0001m*1 1c ! e (m*\u0001 1\u0002 e )\/m*2 1 1\nstronger than . So in case 1, equilibrium conditions 2a and 2b willc ! u*\u0001 u*2 2 1\nbe fulfilled, and even for some parameters in case 2, workers would not start\nsending additional applications even if all firms offered only one wage.\nFirms might want to deviate from the only candidate for a single wage\n(see [28]) despite the fact that this candidate wage is\u0001m* \u0001m*1 1w*p (m*e )\/(1\u0001 e )1 1\ndetermined by their first-order condition. At high (not offered) wages the queue\nlength might increase fast because workers would send their high applications\nif these high wages were offered, which happens in region according to\u00af[w, 1]\nproposition 1. Since by construction the wage is optimal on , a firm\u00afw* [u , w]1 1\nthat is looking for a profitable deviation has to find the optimal wage in the\ninterior of . Since according to proposition 1, we have by\u00af[w, 1] u p c \u0002 u2 2 1\n(24) the profit for a deviant that offers a wage\u0001m \u0001m*1P(m)p (1\u0001 e )(1\u0001 e )\u0001 mc 2\nin . If there is a profitable deviation, it must be profitable to deviate to\u00af(w, 1)\ngiven by the first-order condition , which implies in\u02c6\u0001m \u0001m*1\u02c6 \u02c6m e (1\u0001 e )p c m ! m*2 2\ncase 2 and in case 3.

(A2)\nComparing (A2) with (32) establishes that is strictly smaller than K in case\u02c6P(m)\n2, making a deviation unprofitable, and strictly larger than K in case 3, yielding\na strictly profitable deviation (the wage associated with is indeed above in\u02c6 \u00afm w\ncase 3). Therefore, an equilibrium with one wage exists in case 2 (and entry is\nsuch that ), and not in case 3.vp 1\/m*1\nFinally, it is immediate that in case 2 an equilibrium with two wages cannot\nexist because, by , the marginal utility of the second application isu*\u0001 u* ! c2 1 2\ntoo low, whereas an equilibrium with two wages exists in case 3 since u*\u00012\n(with entry , and ).\u0001m*2u* 1 c vp v \u0002 v v p 1\/m* v p [1\u0001 (1\u0001 e )\/m*]\/m*1 2 1 2 2 2 1 2 1\nTherefore, in case 2 every worker sends one application to the firm with the\nunique wage, and in case 3 every worker sends two applications, one for each\nof the two wages. Uniqueness is then ensured by lemma 3. QED\nExtended Setup for Section V\nThis section generalizes the setting to the case in which workers can send any\nnumber of applications, at a cost .

Then the integrand gives the probability that the worker takes\nthe job at a different firm.\nThe definitions for all other variables, that is, m, p, h, and p, remain unchanged.\nWith these adjustments the equilibrium definition extends to this section.\nProof of Proposition 5\nConsider some (candidate) equilibrium with some g that we fix for the moment.\nDenote by the highest integer for which .

Proposition 2, stating that there exists no equilibrium in which only one\nwage is offered, can now easily be shown with similar techniques whenever\nfor some . By a similar argument, it is straightforward that at least ig 1 0 i 1 1i\nwages have to be offered in equilibrium whenever . Given that (A5) isg 1 0i\nstrictly concave, it is also immediate that all firms within the same interval offer\nthe same wage, yielding exactly wages when some workers send applications.\u02c6 \u02c6i i\nCall the group of firms that end up offering the ith-highest wage group i and\nindex all their variables accordingly.

Since equilibrium search is\nalways more efficient than a process of random applications (as would happen\nif all firms offered the same wage), it will suffice to show this for the latter. As\n, it cannot happen that workers and firms both are matched with prob-i* r \u0003\nabilities bounded away from one. If that were the case, then some fraction\nof firms would always remain unmatched. But then the chance that aa 1 0\nworker applies to such a firm with any given application is a, so that the prob-\nability that he applies to such a firm with at least one of his applications converges\nto one. This yields a contradiction, since he gets matched for sure when he\napplies to a firm that lacks another applicant (maybe at another firm; if not,\nthen for sure by this firm by stability). With unequal measures of workers and\nactive firms, it is obviously the shorter side whose probability of being matched\nconverges to one; with equal measures the probability of being matched is the\nsame, and agents from both sides get matched with probability converging to\none.\nFor the next arguments, recall that the marginal utility gain (excluding the\nmarginal application cost) of the th application, given by , convergesi* u* \u0001 u*i* i*\u00011\nto zero as . This will be used to establish the limit for the average wagei* r \u0003\nif firms are either on the long or on the short side of the market.\nCase 1: The following will be proved: If firms are strictly on the short side of\nthe market, then it has to hold that . Firms being strictly on the shortw(i*) r 0\nside means that there exists a subsequence of \u2019s such that for alli* v(i*) ! 1\u0001 e\nand some . That implies for some . If , then therei* e 1 0 j(i*) ! a a ! 1 w(i*) r\u0004 0\nexists a subsequence and some such that and (sinceq 1 0 w(i*) r q p(i*) r 1\u0001 q\nthe first step proved that when firms are on the short side). Nowh(i*) r 1\nconsider a deviant firm that always offers wage . As workers send more\u2032w p q\/2\napplications, the hiring probability for the deviant has to converge to one. The\nreason is that for workers the marginal utility of sending the last application\nconverges to zero, which implies that the probability of getting the job at the\ndeviant firm has to become negligible; otherwise each worker would like to send\nhis last application there to ensure against the probability of not being1\u0001 a\nhired. With the hiring probability approaching one, the profit of the deviant\nconverges to ; that is, the deviation is profitable. Thus, it has to hold1\u0001 q\/2\nthat .w(i*) r 0\nCase 2: The following will be proved: If firms are strictly on the long side of\nthe market, then . Assume that there exists a subsequence of \u2019s suchw(i*) r 1 i*\nthat for all and some . In this case for somev(i*) 1 1\u0002 e i* e 1 0 h(i*) ! a a !\nand all . If , then there exists a subsequence and some such1 i* w(i*) r\u0004 1 q ! 1\nthat and . Consider a firm that always offers wagew(i*) r q p(i*) r p \u2264 a(1\u0001 q)\nsuch that . Again, the hiring probability of the de-\u2032 \u2032w \u0001 (q, 1) 1\u0001w 1 a(1\u0001 q)\nviant converges to one because if there were a nonnegligible chance of getting\nthe job at , workers would rather send their last application to this higher\u2032w\nthan average wage. This means that the deviant\u2019s profit converges to , so\u20321\u0001w\nthe deviation is profitable. Therefore, .w(i*) r 1\nThis immediately implies that . Otherwise a subsequence of \u2019s ac-v(i*) r 1 i*\nefficiency of simultaneous search 911\ncording to either case 1 or case 2 has to exist; but in case 1 profits are above\nentry costs and in case 2 they are below entry costs, violating the free-entry\ncondition. Finally, since and firms get matched with probability closev(i*) r 1\nto one, the free-entry condition implies that the average paid wage has tow(i*)\nconverge to . This directly implies that .1\u0001K u* r 1\u0001Ki*\nThe final task is to show that each worker\u2019s search costs converge to zero,\nand therefore .
