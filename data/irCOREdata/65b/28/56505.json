As developments are taking place, \nnew service models are emerging and the evidence base \nincreasing. 'li, keep pace with these changes training \nproviders are faced with developing curricula that are \nresponsive to the diversity of mental health provision that \nshould be available in a modern service while ensuring \nthe breadth 01 teaching docs not compromise the depth oi  \nlearning required. \nIt is widely acknowledged that education and training \nfor mental health practice has not kept pace with \ncontemporary service models or the changing needs of \nservice users and carers (Brooker et all 2002). It seems rnental \nhealth training providers face a challenge to respond to the \nisales of service change and the associated change in the \nknowledge and skills base. The recent review by the Chief \nNursing Officer on mental health nursing (Department of \nHealth, 2006) gives a clear indication of the topography of \nmodern mental health nursing. The review promotes care \nfor all people of all ages and emphasises the diversity of \nmental health disorders that need to be treated. In addition, \nit recognises the variety of settings in which mental health \ncare must be delivered including the criminal justice and \nprimary care environments. The review also proposes that \nmental health nurses and their education providers should \nuse this period of change to consider the value base \nunderpinning the activity described above. \nThe attention placed on values-based practice appears to \nbe justified. Despite significant advances in our \nunderstanding of mental health and an  increase in the \navailability of psychological treatments, service users, their \nfamilies arid carers continue to complain that they are not \nlistened to and little account is taken of their needs \n(Shepherd et all 1995; Middleton et all 2004). Service users \nand carers are seeking alternative approaches to care that \npromote recovery, social inclusion arid citizenship. To \nensure these issues are appropriately addressed there is an \nargument that all educational programmes should promote \nvalues as a foundation for all evidence-based care. \nIt is envisaged that the core curricula of all pre arid post \nregistration training, as well as training for the professionally \nnon-affiliated workforce and mandatory and induction type \ntrairlirlg should be consistent with the 10 ESC. By making \nthese fundamental to all mental health teaching there is \nconsiderable potential to promote education and training \nthat ensures mental health care is responsive to the needs of \nservice users, with day to day practice, based on sound values \nas well as an evidence base. In short, the ESC will assist in the \ndelivery of a modern mental health semce. This xticle briefly \nsummarises the development of the 10 Essential Shared \nCapabilities. It then reports on  a study that assessed the \nutility of a set of learning materials that were developed to \nintroduce the 10 ESC to those involved in mental health care. \n4 The Journal of Mental Health Workforce Development Volume 1 Issue 3 December 2006 Q Pavlllon Journals (Brighton) Ltd \n* ' *  \nThe 10 Essential Shared Capabilities: a framework for mental health practice \nBackground to the development of the \nESC learning pack \nMental health currently represents one of the top clinical \npriorities in the NHS and major reforms have been \nunveiled to modernise health and social care (Department \nof Health, 2000; Department of Health, 1998a). A \nfundamental programme of reform has been outlined in \nthe form of Modcrnising Mental Health Services \n(Department of Health, 1998b) and the National Service \nFrarnework (NSF) for mental health (Department of \nHealth, 1999), which sets standards for mental health care \nacross both health and social care. \nThe past few decades have also witnessed a shift i n  the \nprovision of mental health services from the hospital \nsetting to a range of community services, with an  \nincreasing emphasis on service user centred care, values- \nbased and evidence-based practice. Much of mental \nhealth provision is located in partnership arrangements \nbetween trusts and social care services. In addition, a \nnumber of mental health trusts havc applied for \nfoundation status and will becorrie masters of their own \ndestiny, focused on delivering locally responsive services. \nIn 2001, the Workforce Action Team (WAT) began work \nto identify the knowledge, skills and attitudes that all staff \nworking in mental health services should possess to deliver \neach of the NSI: standards, from the core capabilities that \nthe entire workforce should hold, to those competencies \nthat should be held by specialist practitioners. The Capable \nPractitioner Frarnework (CPF) (Lindley et all 2001) produced \nby the Sainsbury Centre provided some of this outline. \nIn addition to the CPF, the Workforce Action Team \ncommissioned a piece of work to identify the capabilities \nof the current workforce in relation to the new vision for \nmental health delivery. A national exercise was \nconducted, which mapped mental health education and \ntraining across England (Brooker et all 2002). This review \ndemonstrated that mental health training provision was \ninadequate in relation to the delivery of the NSF and the \nNHS Plan. It appeared that training often had too narrow \na clinical focus, and specific leaching on values implicit i n  \nservice delivery and or1 socio-cultural aspects of care were \noften neglected. The findings were consistent with the \nconcerns of service users and carers who complained that \nthey were often not listened to, their contribution to \nmental health care was not valued and that care delivery \nwas not conducted as collaboratively as possible. \nThe 10 Essential Shared Capabilities emerged from \nthese two pieces of work as a joint National Institute of \nMental Health in England (NIMHE) and Sainsbury Centre \nfor Mental IIealth (SCMH) project. Guided by a national \nsteering group, the programme was developed through \ncorisultation with service users, carers, managers, \nacademics and practitioners. Spanning both values-based \nand evidence-based practice, the Essential Shared \nCapabilities provide an  explicit benchrriark of core \nattitudes, skills arid knowledge for the entire mental \nhealth workforce. It is expected that these will be \nincorporated into individuals' appraisals and personal \ndevelop~rient plans and withiri all types of pre arid post \nqualification training aimed at those working within \nmental health services. The 10 Essential Shared \nCapabilities (ESC) havc been developed separately but \nco~riple~rient two other existing skills frameworks, na~rlely \nthe Knowledge and Skills Framework (KSF) (Department \nof Health, 2004) and the Natior~al Occupational Standards \nfor Mental IIealth (NOSMII) (see skillsforhealth.org.uk). \nThe Ten Essential Shared Capabilities Learning Pack for \nMental Health Practice was developed to be piloted as part \nof an  overarching implementation plan to introduce the \nmental health workforce to the core skills, attitudes and \nknowledge needed to deliver best practice. Commissioried \nby the NIMHE National Workforce Implementation Team \nand funded by the NHSIJ, the pack has an  ambitious goal: \nto provide effective training to  the entire mental health \nworkforce spanning the different roles and qualifications, \nfrom those who are starting out in their training to \nexperienced workers. In addition, the aim is to  make the \ntraining interesting and accessible to this wide audience. \nThe ESC pilot programme contains learning materials \nin both 0 - r o m  and paper format. The programme has \nan  introductory guide followed by a central module on \nthe ESC (see Appendix for an  overview of the 10 items). \nThere are four additional linked satellite modules on  \n'involving service users and carers', values-based \npractice', 'race equality and cultural capability' and \n'developing socially inclusive practice'. A learning log or \nworkbook accompariies each module and the programme \nends with a personal action plan and learning review. The \nmaterials have been designed for elther group or \nindividual learning, and it was estimated, would tdke \napproximately 16 hours to complete. See Table 1 (over \nthe page) for a description of the seven modules. \nThe Journal of Mental Health Workforce Development Volume 1 Issue 3 December 2006 O Pavilion Journals (Brighton) Ltd 5 \n* \nThe 10 Essential Shared Capabilities: a framework for mental health practice \nTable 1: The seven modules of the 10 ESC pack \nThe CD-rorn is interactive and provides reading as well \nas practical exercises that need be carried out. In addition, \nthe CD-rom provides links to useful websites and contains \na library of relevant documents that the learner may wish \nto access. The materials can be used in a stand-alone \nfashion or can be integrated into existing training \nprogrammes. \nModule 1 \nModule 2 \n- \nEvaluation \nThe learning materials also contained a brief self-report \nevaluation questionnaire and this paper reports on the \ncollated data. Given that the learner cohorts were made up \nof a range of mental health personriel from statutory and \nnon-statutory sectors and from profesrionally qualified to \nprofessionally aligned groups, the evaluation gives a \nperspective on how these people responded to the materials \nfrom an inter-disciplinary perspective. It has been suggested \nthat inter-professional education occurs when two or more \nprofessions come to learn from each other and together \n(Barr et al, 2005). While the authors can report on how \nprofessionals and others responded to the same materials \nwe are not in a position to report on  the 'professional' or \nhealth care worker make up of the learner groups. This \nlimits the results from an inter-professional basis and the \nself report nature of the evaluation li~riits what can be \ndeduced on the impact on practice of the ESC learner pack. \nGetting Started -guidance notes on using the learning pack for facilitators and learners \nThe Ten Essential Shared Capabilities - An overview of all the 10 ESC \n.. ........ .... \nMethod \nDesign \nThe National Health Service University (later closed in \nNovember 2004) held the initial project management of \nthe ESC programme and through an 'expression of \ninterest' process identified over 60 possible pilot sites \nwhere there was a willingness to  test the ESC learning \nmateridls. Following closure of the NIlSU the project was \ntransferred for co-ordination to one of the authors \n(McGonagle) and organised in close liaison with the eight \nNIMHE Regional Development Centre leads. 1,ocal \ntraining facilitators, either service user trainers, university \nlecturers or organisation 'in-service trainers' were \nrecruited to the pilot. They were nominated by each pilot \nsite organisation as competent training facilitators. The \neight Regional Development Centre leads played a \nsignificant role in  supporting these local training \nfacilitators (see above) in each of the pilot sites. The \nrecruited sites received the ESC packr in September 2005 \nand were asked to complete the programme by mid \nDecember 2005. \nProcedure \nEvaluation forms (or questionnaires) for learners and \nfacilitators were incorporated into each of the 10 ESC \nlearner packs. The evaluation forms were part and parcel \nModule 3 \nModule 4 \nModule 5 \n- \n6 The JOUrnal o f  Mental Health Workforce Development Volume 1 Issue 3 December 2 W  8 Pavlllon Journals (Bnghton) Ltd \nInvolving Service Users and Carers - A review of the 10 ESC in working with the similarities and \ndifferent needs of service users and carers \nValues-based Practice - Using the ESC to work positively with diversity and differences of values \nRace Equality and Cultural Capability - I'romoting understanding of the connections between \nrace, culture, mental health and the 10 ESC \n. .......... .. \nModule 6 \nModule 7 \nDeveloping Socially Inclusive Practice - Using the 10 ESC to challenge the processes that lead to \ninequality and exclusion \nPersonal Action Plan and Learning Review - The 10 ESC Self assessment and action planning \n. \nThe 10 Essential Shared Capabilities: a framework for mental health practice \nof the whole training pack and incorporated into module \n7 (Action Planning). All conlpleted questiorlnaires were \ncollected by one of the authors (IMcG) prior to passing on  \nto the evaluation team (AB & CU). The evaluation \nquestionnaire contained requests for demographic \ninformation arld self report perceptions on  acceptability \nof the learning materials. As noted earlier the limits \nwithin the questionnaire method did not facilitate \ndetailed understanding on how professionals and other \nworkers in mental health compare their perspectives arld \nvalue base in  mental health practice. \nThe self-report qucstiorlnaire methodology was \nfavoured due to the size of the project and the \ninformation requested. The project team were keen to \nobtain a general understanding of people's acceptance of \nthe learning materials as an  approach to foundation \nlearning about Essential Shared Capability training. The \nproject team believed that provision of numerical scoring \nof the modules and opportunity to write considered \nresponses to the exercises and modules was sufficient for \nthe project aims. \nEvaluation method \nThe questionnaire asked both learners and trainers to rate \nstatements relating to the training materials on a Likert \nscale with four categories, namely 'agree strongly', 'agree \nslightly', 'disagree slightly' and 'disagree strongly'. In \naddition the questionnaire prompted respondents to \nqualify ratings and to comment on the learriing materials. \nSample \nThe sample was opporturlistic with 60 sites indicating \noriginally that 1,075 individual learners would participate \nin the testing of the materials. A total 46 sites (77%) and \n579 (54%) individuals participated. The site drop out rate \ncould be explained by the challenging timescale for \nproject completion. A number of sites stated that due to \norganisational pressures (re-structuring etc.), they were \nunable to participate in the study. The sample was drawn \nfrom each of the CSIP\/NlMIIE regions in England. There \nwas a range of sample groups in these sites from 13 in one \nsite and four in another. However, there was no significant \ndifference in the number of drop outs and completers \nbetween the regions. \nAnalysis \nStatistical analysis \nData collected on the two questionnaires (learner \nfeedback questionnaire and facilitatator feedback) were \nseparately double entered onto a computer database drld \ndata entry errors were identified by matching the data \nentry files using the epidemiological software F,pi-Info. All \nerrors were corrected with reference to the original \nquestionnaires arld a final validated data file produced. \nData arialysis was then undertaken using the software \nSPSS version 1 1.5. \nThe only statistical test employed was the chi-square \ntest. This was used to test whether, for categorical data, \nthere were differences between groups including those \nfrom different professional backgrounds, those following \ndifferent styles of learning and those from different \nethnic groups. \nAnalysis of qualitative data \n'I'here were several opportunities in the questionnaires for \nboth learners and facilitators to answer 'open' questions. \nResponses that illuminated important aspects of the \nquantitative evaluation are reported in an attempt to \nmeasure or 'unpack' the numeric data. \nResu I ts \nA total of 579 questionnaires were returned from learners \nand 75 from facilitators. Responses came from 46 of the 60 \nsites that had originally agreed to participate in the pilot \nstudy including mental health NHS trusts, primary care \ntrusts, social services, higher education institutions and \nhousing agencies. \nDemographic details of respondents can be seen in \nTable 2 (over the page). Over two-thirds of both the \nlearners and facilitators were female. Respondents were \nfrom all age groups and from a mix of ethnic \nbackgrounds. Approximately one-quarter of learners and \nfacilitators were from a minority ethnic group. Over two- \nthlrds of the learners were NHS workers compared to  less \nthan half of the facilitators and over 45% of both groups \nheld a professional qualification or a degree. There was \nwide variation in  the professional background of the \nlearners, though 42% of the overall sample was made up \nof nurses and support workers. \nThe 10 Essential shared Capabilities: a framework for mental health practice \nTable 2: Demographics of learners and facilitators \nAge range (mode) \nEthnic group (%) \n........................................ ......................... \nSocial services \nHighest educational qualification \nProEessional qualification \nProfessional background \nStudent nurse \nSocial worker \nHousing support worker \n* Includes student social worker, student occupational therapists, chaplains, CDWs, psychologists, medics etc. (each individual group \nrepresents < 2% of overall sample). \n8 The Journal of Mental Health Workforce Development Volume 1 Issue 3 December 2006 Q Pavillon ~ocrrnals (Brighton) Ltd \nThe 10 Essential Shared Capabilities: a framework for mental health practice \nMode of delivery \n82% (n=557) of the learners reported that the training \nmaterials had been delivered by a facilitator within a \ngroup setting. Less than two-thirds of those who \nresponded commented on  the method of delivery. \nHowever, of those who did only 2%) (n=12) had relied \nsolely on the CD-rom and over half (r1=200) had used only \nthe paper materials. \nOf those 179 learners who reported use of the CD- \nROM (either alone or in addition to the paper materials), \n70% of this number had done so without experiencing \nany technical problems. \nThe training materials \nLearners ratings \nLearners were asked to rate statements relating to  the \ntraining materials on  a Likert scale with four categories, \nrlarnely 'agree strongly', 'agree slightly', 'disagree \nslightly' and 'disagree strongly'. Figure 1 displays the \npercentage of respondents rating who agreed with the \nstatements either 'strongly' or 'slightly'. 'l'he clarity of \nthe materials, the availability of necessary iriformatiori \nt o  use the  materials, t he  style of delivery, the  \nenvironment in  which the materials were delivered, \nand enjoyment of using the materials were all rated \nhighly, with over 80%) of the  learners providing \npositive responses. \nThe level at which the programme was pitched, the \nlevel of support and the organisation of the programme \nwere again rated highly, though over 20%) of responderits \ndid provide a negative response about these elements on  \nthe Likert scale and reported some level of disagreement \nwith the statement 'the progrdnlme was pitched at the \nright level'. \nWhen the ratings of the 'level of the programme' were \ndivided into professional groupings it became apparent that \ncertain groups were more positive about the level than \nothers (see Figure 2 - over the page). Although 100% of \nstudent nurses and housing support workers were in \nagreement that the programme was pitched at the right \nlevel, less than 50% of administrative workers shared this \nview. It is not surprising that those riot working face-to-face \nwith service users felt that the training was less appropriate \nfor them as so much of the material asks participants to \ndraw on  such experiences. Similarly, over a third of service \nusers and carers were of the opinion that the level of the \nmaterials was not appropriate for them. Comments from a \nnumber of service users and carers such as the one below \nsuggest some believed that a relevant role for service users \nand carers was to facilitate the learning itself. \n'It is very important that service users and carers \ncontinue to play an important part in the delivery of \nthe programme no matter what form it takes.' \nFigure 1: Learners' ratings of the training programme \nThe Journal of Mental Health Workforce Develo~men December 2006 Q Pavilion Journals (Bnghton) CM 9 \nThe 10 Essential Shared Capabilities: a framework for mental health practice \nFigure 2: Percentage o f  respondents endorsing appropriateness o f  the level of  the programme b y  \nprofessional grouping \nThe service setting of the participants also impacted \nupon overall evaluation of the content. Qualitative \nfeedback from a number of learners who worked in  \nprimary care felt that examples given were too focused on  \nadults receiving secondary service provision. \nOverall, the length of the training programme received \nthe most negative endorsements, with 60% of learners \ndisagreeing with the statement that 'the programrrie was \nthe right length for me'. Of the comments made on the \ndelivery of materials, the majority complained that the \nprogramme had taken much longer to complete than had \nbeen suggested. Feedback indicated that this could be \nreduced by minimising repetition of exercises that \noccurred between modules. \nThe style of delivery impacted greatly upon the ratings \nof a number of the above elements of the programme ie. \nwhether the learner had undergone the training alone or \nas part of a group programme. Chi-square analyses \nrevealed that those who had studied alone were \nsignificantly more likely to disagree with the statements \nrelating to the appropriateness of the 'style of delivery' \n(individual or group) (p=83.1, d.f.=l, p<0.001), \n'the level of the programme' (X17.06, d.f.=l, p=0.008), \nthe 'environment where the learning took place' \n(X2=24.1, d.f.=l, p<0.001) and the 'support received' \n(XZ=13.90, d.f.=l, p<0.001). In addition, many learners \nand facilitators fed back concerns about 'quality control' \nissues when studying independently and most who \nco~rimented on  the style of delivery believed the materials \nshould be used within a group setting. Without a group \navailable for discussion, it was felt there was n o  way of \ndetermining whether exercises and responses were being \nanswered appropriately and learning was taking place in \nthe required direction. \nFacilitator ratings \nRatings of the materials by facilitators were also positive, \nwith over 70% of respondents providing a positive rating \nfor all but the length of the programme. In keeping with \nthe responses of the learners however, the length of the \nprogramme was rated most negatively with over a third of \nrespondents disagreeing with the appropriateness of this. \nOver 85% of the facilitators provided a positive \nendorsement to statements on the clarity of materials, \nthat the materials supported flexible delivery, on the \nrelevance of the learning outcomes, the achievability of \nthe outcomes and the  enjoyment of the  learning \nexperience. A high proportion also rated the materials as \naddressing diversity and equality issues appropriately and \nalso encouraging service user and carer involvement. \n10 The Journal of Mental Health Workforce Development Volume 1 Issue 3 December 2006 Q Payrlion Journals (Bnghton) Ltd \nThe 10 Essential Shared Capabilities: a framework for mental health practice \nFigure 3: Facilitators' ratings o f  the training programme \nIn relation to accessibility, there was consistent \nfeedback that the materials appeared to be targeting \nclinical practitioners working in secondary care services. \nComments suggested that they were less accessible to \nthose working in primary care and many non-clinicians, \nespecially administrative staff who found them \ndifficult to use. \nModule ratings \nLearners' ratings of the seven modules \nLearners were asked to rate each module on a Likert \nscale with four points namely 'unsatisfactory', \n'satisfactory', 'good' and 'excellent'. Overall the  \nmodules were received very positively with 70% or more \nof the learners rating modules two (the Ten Essential \nShared Capabilities), three (Involving Service Users and \nCarers), four (Values-based Practice) and six (Developing \nSocially Inclusive Practice) as either 'good' or 'excellent'. \nOf these modules three and six received the highest \nrating. Respondents were least satisfied with modules \nfive (Race Equality and Cultural Capability) and seven \n(Personal Action Plan and Learning Review), with over a \nthird of them rating these as either 'satisfactory' or \n'unsatisfactory'. Figure 4 shows the percentage of \nlearners and facilitators rating each module as either \n'good' or 'excellent' \nQualitative feedback or1 ~riodule five on race equality \nand cultural capability was extremely diverse. Many \nlearners found it 'difficult' and 'heavy going' but felt their \nthinking had been challenged. The qualitative results of \nthe ratings of this module were examined to see whether \nany differences were apparent between learners with \ndifferent cultural backgrounds. In general, black and \nAsian learners were more satisfied with this module than \nwhite learners and those of mixed race. When these \ngroups were combined, it was found that the ratings from \nblack and Asian learners were significantly higher than \nthe other two groups (XL=6.09, d.f.=l, p=0.01). \nThere was also mixed written qualitative feedback on \nmodule seven (Personal Action Plan and Learning \nReview). Those who rated this module highly found it \n'useful', 'detailed' and 'helpful with Knowledge and Skills \nFrarriework (KSF) appraisal' however, many learners found \nthe module 'confusing', 'complicated', 'over long' and \n'too labour intensive'. A number of respondents believed \nthis module should have been introduced in module one \nrather than left till the end. \nWhen the professional background of learners was \nconsidered it was found that the majority of student \nnurses and housing support workers were most satisfied \nwith each of the modules, and administrative staff and \noccupational therapists were the least satisfied. \nThe Journal of Mental Health workforce Development Volume I Issue 3 Decemoer 2006 g3 Pavilion Journals,(Brighton) ~ t d  I 1  \nThe 10 Essential Shared Capabilities: a framework for mental health practice \nFigure 4: Learners' and facilitators' ratings of  the modules \n85 \n0, \n- \nw \n# 80 \nw \n5 ()I Learners g 75 \n0 Facllltators \n0, \n70 \nE \nE \n65 \n60 \nI Module 1 Module 2 Module 3 Module 4 Module 5 Module 6 Module 7 I \nFacilitators' ratings of the seven modules \nFacilitators rated each of the seven modules on the same \nLikcrt scale as the learners. Facilitators rating of the \nrnodules, shown in Figure 4, de~rionstrate that they were \nextremely positive towards most of the modules. Only \nmodules one (Getting Started) and seven (Personal Action \nPlan) had more than 30% of respondents rating them as \nbelow 'good'. Facilitators did not show the same level of \ndissatisfaction with module five as the learners, only 22% \nrated this module as less than 'good' compared to 35% of \nthe learners. \nImpact and Overall Rating \nLearners' ratings \nIn total, 90% of learners who rated the materials agreed \n(either 'strongly' or 'slightly') that the materials had \nimpacted on  the way they thought about and worked \nwith service users with mental health problems. When \nresponses were compared to the professional group there \nwere some differences. The eritire group of student nurses \nwho rated the materials (n=29) believed that  the  \nmaterials would make a difference to the way they \nworked whereas 20% (n=14) of social workers were not \nconvinced that this was the case. \nWhen rated overall, the programme was well received. \nEighty per cent of learners (n=486) rated leaming materials \nas either good or excellent. Once again there was somc \nvariation in satisfaction between professional groups. The \nentire group of student nurses rated the programme as good \nor excellent compared to only 55% of the administrative \nstaff (n=21) and 62% of occupational therapists (n=26). \nIn addition, 29% of learners who had undertaken \nlearning on their own rated the materials overall as either \n'acceptable' or 'poor' compared to only 17% who had \nbeen part of a group. A chi-square analysis revealed this \ndifference as highly significant (X2=7.65; d.f.=l; p=0.006). \nFacilitators' ratings \nIn response to a statement asking facilitators to rate \nwhether the learning programme had impacted on the way \nthe learners would work with service users, 95% ag~eed that \nthis was the case (slightly or strongly). They were also very \npositive when rating the programme overall. None of the \n70 facilitators who rated the materials rated them as 'poor' \nand 85% rated them as good or excellent. \nDiscussion \nThe E C  learning materials pilot was corlducted over a four \nmonth period and presented an  appreciable conirnitrnent \nfrom partic~pating organisations. Significantly, the \nmanagement of the learning materials project was handed \nover from the dissolved NI1SU with associated project \ntransfer difficulties such as maintenance of comnlurlication \nwith pilot site co-ordinators and regional leads. \nThe leaming materials were aimed at dI personnel in \nmental health settings regardless of educational or \nprofessional background. The materials can be used flexibly \n(either as a paper resource; CD-ROM or combination, used \n12 The Journal of Mental Health Workforce DevelopmentVolume I lssw 3 December 2006 Q Pav~l~on Journals (Bnghton) ~ t d  \nThe 10 Essential Shared Capabilities: a framework for mental health practice \nas a group resource or for individual learning. The results \nindicate that personnel from niental health services from \nacross the spectrum of roles rated the materials highly. \nAdditional materials that take participants deeper into the \nsubject matter of the ESC and practice applications are \nbeirig developed by the National Institute for Mental \nHealth in England. It is envisaged that the materials \nreported here will form the foundation of a suite of \n~riaterials, which as a whole will form the basis of training \nrnaterials for all mental health services. Evaluation of \nimpact of such learning programmes remains an important \naspect of planning and implementation of programmes \nsuch as these. The results presented here indicate that there \nwas acceptance of the materials as a useful and helpful \nresource. Whether the use of such materials can help \npractitioners continuously improve their practice still \nrequires longer-tenn investigation. \nThe opportunity for comparative inter-professional \neducation around the values of mental health care also \nexists within the framework of the 10 Essential Shared \nCapabilities. The project aims of this pilot programme did \nnot lend themselves for detailed analysis of this important \naspect of health care delivery. The authors suggest that the \nESC do present an  opportunity for educationalists and \nresearchers to investigate differences and similarities of \nvalues behind mental health workforce practice. In this \nstudy different professional groups reported different \nlevels of acceptance of the materials with student nurses \narid housing support workers differing from others, and \nsome differences between professionally qualified groups \n(see Figure 3). Again these self report differences need \nmore detailed investigation and analysis. \nTherefore, although the flexibility of this distance \nlearning package is advantageous in that it allows for \nindividuals to learn in their own time and at their own \npace, it would seem important for learners to have \ncontact with a tutor or mentor to ensure appropriate \nlearning has taken place. \nConclusion \nThe overall evaluation of the pilot ESC training \nprogrammes was highly positive. Learners and facilitators1 \nmentors rated nearly all aspects of the programme highly \n(see F i r e s  1 a d  3), including: the clarity of the \nmaterials, style of delivery, the extent to which the \nprogramme met their learning objectives, the level of the \nmaterials, the learning and organisational support and their \nenjoyment in participating. There was also widespread \nagreement that generally, the individual modules were \nsuccessful in meeting their aims, although it is important to \nnote that facilitators' ratings were higher than learners' \nratings in this regard (see Figure 4). It should also be noted \nthat two modules in particular (module five on race \nequality and cultural capability and module seven on \npersonal action plan and learning review) received \nsubstantially less favourable feedback from learners. The \nrespondents reported that module five (race equality) did \nnot emphasise the full range of BME populations and \nrequired care studies as illustrations. Module seven \n(Personal Action Plan) was reported as too difficult to \nfollow and did not support respondents in their learning. \nIn this context, perhaps what is most important to \nemphasise is that 90% of learners, and 95% of facilitators \nagreed that the learning undertaken would impact upon \nthe way that practitioners would work with service users \nand carers. The nature of this study does not allow any \nstatements to be made on any actual change on role \nperformance and value base of learners involved in the \n5tudy. It is clear from results that positive learning and \nengagement in the programme took place, gleaned from a \nhealthy questionriaire response rate from sites and learners. \nThis pilot programme was designed to provide data to \nbase further enhanced iterations of the 10 ESC learning \nmaterials. In light of the findings, a number of changes are \nbeirig implemented (ie. rewording the material to ensure \napplicability to the entire mental health workforce, such as \nadministrative staff, and not just clinical\/practice ones). \nThe ESC pilot programme has proved successf~ll in \nengaging large numbers of personnel in  discussing, \nchallenging and supporting the competing value bases \nunderpinning mental health practice. \nAddress for correspondence \nIan McGonagle \nCentre for Clinical and Academic Workforce Innovation \n(CCAWI) \nFloor 2 Mill 3, Pleasley Vale Business Park \nOutgang Lane \nMansfield \nNG19 8KL \nEmail: imcgonagle@lincoln.ac.uk \nThe Journal of Mental Health Workforce Develol?m mber 2006 18 Pav~llon Journals (Brighton) Ltd 13 \nThe 10 Essential Shared Capabilities: a framework for mental health practice \nRefe~enCeS \nBarr 11, Koppel I, Reeves S, IIarnmick M & Freeth D (2005) \nEffective Interprofessional Education: Argument, Assumption and \nEvidence.
