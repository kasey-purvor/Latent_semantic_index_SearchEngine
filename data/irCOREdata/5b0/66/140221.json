We explore the\nbrand\u2019s marketing, networks and communications channels which have lead to its rapid\ngrowth from niche player to a mainstream brand. However, we also identify a distinct\nslowdown in this growth, particularly in its core retail coffee market, and explore whether\nCaf\u00e9direct has reached its natural limit for the growth as an ethical brand.\nThe case was drawn from both a review of existing literature and two longitudinal studies\ncarried out between 1999-2004 and 1999-2009. For those interested in more details of our\ntrail of evidence gathered during the development and writing of this case, please see\nAppendix 1 where we outline our methodology in more detail. However, since this case is\ndesigned to be read as a story, we have deliberately suppressed many of the sources of our\ncompany insights in order to maintain a consistent narrative.\nWe are not the first people to investigate the marketing of Caf\u00e9direct (Low and Davenport,\n2005, McDonagh, 2002, Nichols and Opal, 2005 and Wright, 2004) nor to look at the\nimportance of networks in fair trade (Davies, 2008, Raynolds, Murray and Taylor, 2004) or\neven the effects of mainstreaming in the industry (Davies, 2007, Doherty and Tranchell,\n2007, Moore, 2004, Golding and Peattie, 2005, Wilkinson, 2007). However, through our in-\ndepth investigation of the company, its supply chain, customers and general marketplace\ndynamics over time, we can provide a critical examination of what has lead to the success of\nthe brand and where the limits of its expansion might lie.\nSince the success of Caf\u00e9direct has made a significant contribution to the mainstreaming of\nfair trade in the UK (Nicholls and Opal, 2005), the lessons from this case study are important\nto other companies utilising ethical claims to compete in the mainstream.\nFair trade or Fairtrade\u00a9\nFair trade is a trading partnership based on dialogue, transparency and respect that seeks\ngreater equity in international trade. It contributes to sustainable development by offering\nbetter trading conditions to, and securing the rights of, marginalized producers and workers.\n3Fair trade organisations are engaged actively in supporting producers, raising awareness\namong consumers and campaigning for changes in the rules and practice of conventional\ninternational trade (FINE, 2001). It started initially with the importation of craft and\nhousehold goods from under-developed countries by charities and religious organisations for\nsale in wealthier countries, especially Western Europe. Products such as the Argentinean pin\ncushion sold through Oxfam in the 1960s and the Bangladeshi wicker baskets from Traidcraft\nin the 1970s and 1980s are good early examples of fair trade products where retailers paid a\nhigher price directly to the producer and, where applicable, they assisted producer\ncommunities with social, environmental and economic issues they were facing. This\ncontinued through the 1980s with increasing numbers of products, sometimes of dubious\nquality, being imported for sale through specialist retailers (often called World Shops) or\nthrough mail order catalogues, such as the Traidcraft catalogue. Up until the early 90s, fair\ntrade was unbranded, mostly not-audited and its products were fondly remembered as\u2026\u2026\n\u201cdisgusting\u201d (referring to the coffee), \u201cpoorly made and pointless\u201d (referring to the craft\nproducts) and \u201cgosh, another basket\u2026. how are you going to sell this?\u201d (From the daughter\nof a Traidcraft Rep).\nDuring the late 1980s and early 1990s, a parallel stream of fair trade goods appeared in World\nShops which offered commodity products such as coffee, tea and sugar, for general\nconsumption. They followed a much more structured, audited and labelled method of\nidentifying fair trade products. These included the first fair trade coffee product, Max\nHavelaar, that was formally audited and labelled for sale in Northern Europe, and Campaign\nCoffee sold in the UK by mail order (later rebranded to Equal Exchange). In 1991, the\nFairtrade Foundation (FtF) was created by a number of charities, including Oxfam, Christian\nAid and the World Development Movement. Its responsibility was to oversee the Fairtrade\u00a9\nMark (See Figures 1a and 1b). It does this by awarding the Mark to products that have had\ntheir supply chain audited to ensure they adhere to the standards laid down by the world fair\ntrade governing organisation; the Fairtrade Labelling Organisation (FLO). It is the FLO that\nsets the standards for Fairtrade\u00a9 commodity products and a separate body, FLO-CERT,\nwhich conducts the supply chain audit; for ease of communications, we will refer to these\nrelated bodies as the FLO.\n4Although there are a great number of fair trade goods which do not carry the Fairtrade\u00a9 Mark\n(especially crafts and clothing), Caf\u00e9direct adopted the Fairtrade\u00a9 certification in setting up\nits brand. As a result, we will focus primarily on these FLO certification standards here rather\nthan of the others offered by organisations such as the International Federation for Alternative\nTrade (IFAT), European Fair Trade Association (EFTA) and Network of European World\nShops (NEWS).\nThe FLO standards aim to ensure both better working conditions and more sustainable\nfarming practice in grower communities. As coffee and tea prices are volatile, the FLO sets\nminimum market prices (floor price) that are paid for Fairtrade\u00a9 certified products to cover\nthe cost of production. For example, the Fairtrade\u00a9 minimum prices for different types of\ncoffee beans are as follows: Arabica coffee = 131 US cents\/lb; Arabica organic coffee= 151\nUS cents\/lb; Robusta coffee =111 US cents\/lb; Robusta organic coffee =131 US cents\/lb (in\nNovember, 2008). Whenever the world market prices go above these minimum prices;\nFairtrade\u00a9 also guarantees a higher-than-market price to growers through an additional\n\u201csocial premium\u201d of between 5-15 cents per kg, depending on the product. For coffee, this\nequates to paying the market price plus 10 US cents\/lb. Through these two pricing\nmechanisms, Fairtrade\u00a9 aims to guarantee a long term, sustainable commitment to its\ngrowers, giving them more opportunity to plan for the future and to invest in their farms and\ncommunities.\nFollowing the introduction of fair trade labelling, fair trade evolved rapidly both in terms of\nsales and public awareness. With increasing levels of institutionalization, it has established\nitself as one of the major initiatives to pursue social purposes using market mechanisms, i.e.\npoverty alleviation for small-scale producers in the South through sales for products in the\nFigure 1a: Fairtrade Mark\n(1992-2001)\nFigure 1b: Fairtrade Mark\n(2001- )\n5North1 (Moore, 2004; Nicholls and Opal, 2005; Raynolds et al, 2007). Nicholls and Opal\n(2005) propose that fair trade is a new business approach that looks holistically at the supply\nchain to address market failures and their social impacts at source whilst acknowledging the\nneed for profitability.\nWorldwide, consumers spent over \u00a31.6 billion on Fairtrade\u00a9 Marked products in 2007, with\nover 7.5 million producers and workers across 58 developing countries benefiting (FLO,\n2008). A number of authors (e.g. Golding and Peattie, 2005, Lowe and Davenport, 2005a and\n2005b, Moore, Gibbon and Slack, 2006; Nicholls and Opal, 2005) identify the\nmainstreaming2 of fair trade through the successful branding of fair trade companies, such as\nCaf\u00e9direct and Divine Chocolate, as a key factor in the rise of such products. However, the\nmainstreaming of fair trade produce is not without its critics.\nThe Pros and Cons of Mainstreaming Fair Trade\nA number of authors have reported on the positive arguments for Fairtrade\u00a9 Marked products\nbeing in the mainstream because of increased sales which benefit a larger number of\nmarginalised producers, and the opportunity to reach a wider audience with the fair trade\nmessage (Lowe and Davenport 2005a, 2005b, Nicholls and Opal, 2005). In fact, earlier\nresearch on fair trade highlights the problem of poor availability in supermarkets as a limiting\nfactor in the growth of fair trade sales (Nicholls 2002, Nicholls and Opal 2005, Ronchi 2001\nand Strong 1997). Furthermore, Teather (2006) argues that the involvement of major retailers\nhas been a key factor in the growth and Taylor et al (2005) suggest the new corporate interest\nin fair trade is an indication that fair trade has succeeded in demonstrating that the market\nshould reward socially just and environmentally sound practices. Today, more than 4,500 fair\ntrade products are available in the mainstream UK market (Fairtrade Foundation 2007). These\nproducts have entered the mainstream via a number of differing entry routes including:\n\uf0b7 Branded fair trade products from 100% Fair Trade Companies such as Caf\u00e9direct and\nDivine Chocolate Ltd. All products from these companies carry the Fairtrade\u00a9 Mark.\n\uf0b7 Branded Products from Fair Trade Adopters where significant part of their product\nportfolio is Fairtrade\u00a9 Marked products e.g. Clipper Teas, Green and Blacks\nChocolate, Percol Coffee Company.\n\uf0b7 Line extensions from Fair Trade Branders where they are large, mainstream\norganisations wishing to have ethical products in their portfolio e.g. Fyffes (one of the\n6five largest global fresh produce distributors which supply\u2019s Tesco with own label\nbananas), Nestl\u00e9 and Billingtons (Europe\u2019s leading supplier of unrefined cane sugar).\n\uf0b7 Retailer Own Label Fair Trade products from suppliers such as Tesco own-label fair\ntrade coffee. These products sit on the shelf alongside branded fair trade products.\n\uf0b7 Fair trade products from retailers Marks and Spencer and Starbucks Coffee Company\nwho only stock their own brand products.\n(Davies 2007; Doherty and Tranchell 2007).\nAccording to the Economist (2006), the decision to buy fair trade products in grocery stores\nsends out a very clear political message. A number of authors agree that consumers act\nneither as a purely economic agent nor as purely political agent, but as a mixture of the two;\nwith consumers whose identity, beliefs and practices aim to address the economic imbalances\nhighlighted by the fair trade movement (Parker 1999, Urry, 1995). Connolly and Shaw (2006)\nsuggest that many ethical consumers believe they are part of a wider collective of concerned\nconsumers, although acting individually. It is interesting to note that in a Market & Opinion\nResearch International Ltd. (MORI) survey on fair trade awareness, 43% of those aware of\nfair trade were first made aware of what it stands for whilst shopping (MORI 2005). Strong\n(1996, 1997) also identified communicating the human element of sustainability as one of the\nkey challenges for fair trade companies wishing to develop a mainstream position. This is\nimportant if fair trade companies are to avoid social\/environmental qualities becoming\nsubordinated to just price. Moore et al. (2006) argue the fair trade products in the mainstream\nneed to work on the depth of the fair trade message to avoid it being seen just as a lifestyle\nchoice, something we will explore later through Caf\u00e9direct advertising.\nDespite the growth in fair trade, a number of authors warn that uncritical engagement with\nmainstream business risks absorption and dilution of the fair trade movement (Lowe and\nDavenport 2005a, 2005b, Moore et al 2006, Murray et al 2006, Taylor et al 2005). This can\nlead to \u2018clean-wash\u2019 which occurs when a company \u201cderives positive benefits from its\nassociation with the fair trade movement, however minimal its efforts to live the values\u201d\n(Murray and Raynolds 2000:p68-69). Moore et al (2006) also highlight the possibility that\ncorporate commitment to fair trade may only be temporary. Taylor et al (2005) argue that\ncorporations cannot be expected to have the same levels of interest and commitment that\ninspired the creation of the fair trade system, as evidenced by the proliferation of other ethical\n7labels outside the Fairtrade Labelling Organisation (FLO) system which do not demonstrate\nthe equivalent social standards. The Fairtrade\u00a9 labelling system does not differentiate\nbetween organisations which are solely fair trade companies with direct links with producers,\nand the larger corporations whose fair trade commitment is only a small percentage of their\nsales. Raynolds et al (2007) propose that one of the challenges facing fair trade organisations\nwill be to ensure it is not just about increasing prices but also maintaining a transformative\nalternative system with people and the environment at its centre. Low and Davenport (2005a\nand 2005b) argue that fair trade in the mainstream has already shifted the message from\nparticipation in an international programme of trade reform to individualised shopping for a\nbetter world by focussing mainly on the dimensions of fair price for producers and product\nquality.\nNestl\u00e9\u2019s 2005 UK launch of its fair trade coffee, Partners Blend, has brought this debate of\n\u2018clean-wash\u2019 into sharp focus (Cookson 2005) as the company still occupies the top spot in\nthe Ethical Consumer Organisation\u2019s list of boycotted brands, largely due to its aggressive\nmarketing of baby milk powder in developing countries. Nestl\u00e9 makes no secret of the\ncommercial reasons for its decision to launch a fair trade product and aims to target the semi-\nethical segment. According to Tallontire et al (2001), semi-ethical consumers are infrequent\npurchasers of ethical goods who may be persuaded to buy more if the goods were made more\nattractive or more easily available to them. Currently, Partners Blend makes up only 0.2% of\nthe Nestl\u00e9 coffee range, with the remainder of its coffee being bought at the prevailing world\nmarket price. However, it claims that there are just not enough fair trade coffee producers to\nswitch production to fair trade for its major lines.\nFair trade brand pioneers like Cafedirect and Divine Chocolate are partly-owned by producer\ngroups with producer representatives on the Boards of these companies in unique governance\narrangements. Doherty and Tranchell (2007) argue that these fair trade companies as\nexamples of radical mainstreaming that can actually strengthen the transformative message of\nfair trade. By investigating such companies through the type of longitudinal study reported\nhere, we can gain greater insights into the impacts of mainstreaming on the fair trade\nideology, and the growing pains of fair trade and other similar social initiatives as they\nemerge from their grass roots to mainstream, highly visibility organisations.\n8The Founding of Caf\u00e9direct\nThe International Coffee Agreement which controlled the price of coffee beans collapsed in\n1989. This caused the price of coffee beans to fall to a third of its pre-1989 level within a few\nyears and had a devastating effect on the incomes of small-scale coffee farmers globally\n(Brown, 2007). Three quarters of the global supply of coffee is produced by small, family\nowned farms. In response to this crisis Oxfam, Traidcraft, Equal Exchange and Twin Trading\ngot together in 1991 and formed the branded fair trade coffee company, Caf\u00e9direct. All four\norganisations were already involved in the distribution of fair trade coffee into the UK but\nthey realised that collectively they could achieve so much more:\n\u201cOur contribution to Caf\u00e9direct was that we were the only member who had any marketing\nexperience. Twin Trading had the coffee supply chain management, Oxfam had shops and\ncampaigners and Traidcraft had Traidcraft Reps.\u201d (Founder of Equal Exchange and Director of\nCaf\u00e9direct, 2002)\nCaf\u00e9direct was born from this alliance of interested charities with one specific mission \u2013 to\npioneer fair trade into the mainstream of consumer consciousness and purchasing in the UK.\nBy 2007, Caf\u00e9direct had become the UK\u2019s largest fair trade hot drinks company and the\nfourth largest hot beverage company in the UK with a turnover of \u00a322.3m in 2007, up 3%\nyear-on-year. Its brands include Caf\u00e9direct Coffee, Teadirect and Cocodirect which are sold\nthrough both major supermarket chains and alternative channels of distribution, including\nOxfam shops. Caf\u00e9direct is the fifth largest coffee brand in the UK with a 7% market share of\nthe roasted and ground coffee market (Mintel, 2008) and sources coffee beans from 39\nproducer organisations across 13 different countries which means that over a 250,000 growers\nbenefit. Caf\u00e9direct\u2019s product portfolio includes 15 coffee products (from roast and ground,\nespresso, decaffeinated, organic to instant), 3 tea products and Cocodirect drinking chocolate.\nTeadirect was launched in 1998 is now ranked ninth in the UK\u2019s top tea brands and its sales\nhave grown 30% in the last year.\nCaf\u00e9direct\u2019s policy is to go further than just the FLO price standards outlined above by paying\nan extra 10% at least above this Fairtrade\u00a9 price; they call this their \u201cGold Standard\u201d. For\nexample, tea prices fell from $1.60 to $1.35 per kg in Tanzania and as low as $1.18 in Uganda\nduring 2004 and 05, nonetheless Caf\u00e9direct bought at a minimum price of $1.95 per kg\n(Caf\u00e9direct, 2005).\n9Overall, in 2007 Caf\u00e9direct paid nearly \u00a31.0 million above the market price for its coffee, tea\nand cocoa raw materials (data demonstrated by a Marketing Manager at Caf\u00e9direct during\nobservation). The company has then paid a further \u00a3600,000 to its producer partners through\nits Producer Partnership Programmes (PPP). These programmes consist of business\ndevelopment training tailored to the needs of producer organisations supplying Caf\u00e9direct\nwith tea and coffee. They include building capabilities in marketing, quality control, crop\nhusbandry and crop diversification.\nCaf\u00e9direct and the 3 phases of fair trade marketing\nCaf\u00e9direct really entered the UK market in 1993 when Equal Exchange negotiated its first\nmajor grocery retail contract to supply roast and ground (R&G) coffee to Safeway\nSupermarket stores across Scotland. All of its products were carrying the Fairtrade\u00a9 Mark;\nthis was the major breakthrough in fair trade that the founders were looking for. Shortly\nafterwards, the Co-operative Retail Group, followed by Sainsbury\u2019s, started stocking\nCaf\u00e9direct R&G and, within 3 years, Caf\u00e9direct was available from most major UK retailers;\nfair trade had moved away from just being sold in World Shops and was entering the\nmainstream of UK grocery markets. Davies (2007) identifies mainstreaming as the third era\nin the fair trade marketing evolution since inception:\n\uf0b7 The Solidarity Era (~1970-1990) \u2013 Where fair traders tried to demonstrate their\nsolidarity with third world producers. This development can be considered as the genesis of\nthe marketing of sustainable products.\n\uf0b7 The Market Development Era (1990 \u2013 2002) - Where fair trade tried to shake its\ncharity image and compete openly on the market with quality products and using the\nFairtrade\u00a9Mark as a unique selling point\n\uf0b7 The Mass-Market Era (2002-Date) \u2013 Where fair trade competes in the mainstream\nwith a wide range of fair trade brands positioned at differing pricing points and offering a\nrange of qualities (from budget to premium) and with a number of multinational coffee brands\nwho now include a fair trade brand in their portfolio. In each case, the brands are marketed\naccording to the unique social\/environmental attributes they can display.\nCaf\u00e9direct has followed similar stages in its marketing evolution to those outlined above since\nits introduction in 1991. One of the main guiding principles for Caf\u00e9direct in the early days\n10\nwas that it had to shake the stigma associated with the poor quality \u2018charity products\u2019.\nConsistent high product quality standards were seen by Caf\u00e9direct management as critical\nbecause its benchmark competition was viewed as mainstream brands such as Nescaf\u00e9\noriginal, and Kenco medium roast. Since launch, Caf\u00e9direct has achieved this and has always\nbeen viewed as premium quality brand with retail prices 20-30% above competition\nthroughout most of its brand lifecycle. Caf\u00e9direct argues that its investment in producer\norganisations via PPP ensures that product quality is second to none across its three main\nproduct lines. Its first major product line was R&G coffee; however, market research\nrevealed that the majority of UK consumers were drinking freeze dried coffee, so in 1994 it\nlaunched a freeze dried instant coffee. This enabled the company to make its first profits in\n1995 and heralded the start of Caf\u00e9direct\u2019s strong growth which was continuously fuelled by\nnew product introductions. As such three years later, Caf\u00e9direct entered the tea market with\nTeadirect and then, in 2002, Cocodirect drinking chocolate was launched using both fair trade\ncocoa and sugar. Recently, they have released many gourmet single-source-of-origin coffees\n(some of them organic), a range of premium instant coffees and specialist teas.\nBearing in mind Caf\u00e9direct\u2019s strong brand name today, it is hard to imagine they have never\nadvertised on television. The company has even won the 2004 Marketer of the Year Award\nfrom the Marketing Society on an official marketing budget of only \u00a34,000 (less than 0.02%\nof the total marketing spend in the industry). This has been achieved through the clever use of\npartners, volunteers and network associates. Principally, PR, journalism and print advertising\nhave been the driving force behind Caf\u00e9direct\u2019s marketing and advertising success. Through\nthese media, the three eras of the company\u2019s marketing, advertising and packaging strategy is\nclearly visible:\nFair Trade Solidarity: Marketing Ethics 1993 \u2013 1999\nAlthough the product quality has changed little over the years, the advertising, branding and\npackaging has gone through some significant changes. Early packaging tended towards\nsimplicity but with large amounts of text telling customers about the product and the\nproducers (see Table 1). This fits well with a solidarity view of the products by bringing the\nconsumers and the producers closer together. It also supports the effort to market the ethics of\nthe product by informing customers of how \u201cethical\u201d the product is.\n11\nThe poster campaigns during this 6 year period show farmers either suffering or\ndemonstrating pride (see Figure 2) and tended to contain a testimony and portray how buying\nCaf\u00e9direct assists these coffee farmers and their communities. This ties in closely with\nattempts to draw customers into feeling solidarity with producers and to begin the process of\ndemonstrating how Caf\u00e9direct provides a more ethical and sustainable alternative choice in\nthe coffee market.\nFair Trade Solidarity\n1991-1999\nMarket Ethics\nMass-Market\n2004-Present\nMarket Uniqueness\nMarket Development\n1999-2003\nMarket Quality\nTable1: Packaging Developments in the Caf\u00e9direct Brand Portfolio\n12\nAs brand recognition grew, Caf\u00e9direct became more controversial by suggesting that not only\nwas their coffee ethical but, by their very nature, the mainstream competition was not (see the\n\u2018Whiff\u2019 advert in Figure 3). Similarly, they attacked the \u201cfat-cat\u201d mentality of large\ncorporations as their \u2018Has Been\u2019 advert from the appropriately-titled 'edge' campaign shows\n(also in Figure 3). In a stroke of creativity, \u2018Has Been\u2019 was powerfully displayed on the\nGuardian's obituaries page on September 8th, 1997 which was otherwise entirely dedicated to\nthe main obituary for one of Africa's most corrupt dictators, Mobutu Sese Seke.\nFigure 3: Ethical vs. unethical press campaigns\nFigure 2: Solidarity poster and press campaigns\n13\nOne problem with this type of branding is its similarity to the charity aspect of fair trade and\nthe \u201cpoor quality\u201d image of pre-Fairtrade\u00a9 Mark products. Additionally, there is a perceived\nlimit within the fair trade community as to how much market share \u201ccore ethics\u201d can gain a\ncompany (Managing Director Divine Chocolate, interview 2004). This is considered to be\naround 3% market share for cocoa and coffee in Europe (Managing Director Divine\nChocolate, interview 2003; CEO Caf\u00e9direct, interview 2007) and is evidenced by other fair\ntrade initiatives such as Max Havelaar3, Transfair4, R\u00e4ttvisem\u00e4rkt5 and Reilun Kaupan6 all of\nwhich have struggled to grow beyond 3% market share.\nMarket Development: Marketing Quality 1999-2003\nTo push sales above this 3% level, Caf\u00e9direct changed its messages during 1999\/2000,\nportraying their branding in a more evocative format. The company created brands which\nsuggested high quality, premium coffees and teas by showing scenes from the environments\nin which the commodities were produced (see packaging developments in Table 1 and the\nnewspaper advertisements in Figure 4 below) as opposed to portraits of subsistence coffee\nfarmers. They even changed the name of Caf\u00e9direct Instant to 5065 \u2013 the average height at\nwhich their coffee beans were grown \u2013 to make a clear transition to the premium end of the\nmarket.\nOver the following two years, there was continued progress into new advertising methods and\nmedia with the first, highly evocative cinema advertisement for any fair trade company in\nwhich the peak of Machu Picchu (The face in the mountain in the poster below) rises up at the\nsmell of the coffee. In another first, Caf\u00e9direct was granted advertising rights on the London\nUnderground for its new brand 5065 during this period.\nFigure 4: Market development evocative and quality image campaigns\n14\nThe main purpose of Caf\u00e9direct\u2019s new advertising and packaging was to move the focus away\nfrom the grower (or the \u201ccore ethics\u201d message previously used) to the experience of the\nconsumer. Consequently, there was a major reduction in the amount of fair trade text on the\npackaging and advertising, with grower testimonies becoming 3-line sound bites rather than\nstories. There was even talk of dropping the Fairtrade\u00a9 Mark altogether as Caf\u00e9direct had\nhigher brand awareness than the Mark itself. Although this did not occur, the space given over\nto the Mark was distinctly reduced. The impact of this new, customer experience message was\nto spark a rapid growth in sales and much greater brand awareness and market share rising\nabove the 3% barrier.\nAs each product was rebranded to reflect its new positioning, the company began to have a\nnew problem. Although sales had been increasing for a number of years in each category and\nthe brands were considered quality premium products, they each needed their own marketing\nand sales support which led to rapidly increasing costs in slowly growing markets.\nCompetitors also began to follow their lead by rebranding and adopting product quality\nmessages. The market has also seen a vast increase in the number of fair trade brands on the\nsupermarket shelf, including premium coffees from major roasters, budget own-label brands\nfrom supermarkets and fair trade lines from Nestl\u00e9 (and similarly branded \u201csustainable\u201d\ncoffee from Kenco). Competitive advantage from the \u201ccore ethics\u201d of the product was being\neroded and with trusted brands bringing out quality products, the quality message was no\nlonger as effective. The impact was Caf\u00e9direct\u2019s revenues and growth had begun to shrink.\nMarket research undertaken by Caf\u00e9direct suggested that consumers were not aware that its\ncoffees, teas and cocoas came from the same organisation, meaning that Caf\u00e9direct could not\nleverage the success of its coffee to sell newer products (interview in 2007 with former CEO\nat Caf\u00e9direct, 1998-2008). The CEO also confirmed that now the quality of the brand was\npublicly recognised and with more competitors matching this quality, the main differentiator\nfor the organisation needs to change:\n\u201cThe key strength identified was our relationships with producers which demonstrated our values\nand integrity. The research showed that our stakeholders want us to shout about these relationships\nby symbolising through producer stories showing the impact of these fair trade relationships. This\nshould be at the heart of our values resulting in a trusted brand, dividends and social\/environmental\nbenefits for producers.\u201d\n15\nWith product quality now established, it became the organisational values and Caf\u00e9direct\u2019s\ncorporate brand communications that would influence sales growth and help reduce\nmarketing expenditure. Beginning in 2004, , Caf\u00e9direct undertook a corporate product and re-\nbranding programme which culminated in 2007 with its brand portfolio being presented as a\nfamily of related products.\nMass-Markets: Marketing Uniqueness 2004-present\nIn making this move, the company departed from product brand marketing towards corporate\nbrand marketing \u2013or a \u201cbranded house\u201d in the parlance- to communicate how uniqueness of\nCaf\u00e9direct across its range of brands.\nThe company can justifiably claim a range of innovations which makes it unique: the first fair\ntrade company to advertise, the innovator of the first fair trade instant coffee and the first fair\ntrade company to have an initial public offering (IPO). It can also identify a number of\nmarket initiatives such setting up as the Gold Standard where not only does the company pay\nthe fair trade premium to growers, but it also pays an additional premium for grower\ndevelopment initiatives. Caf\u00e9direct has invested \u00a31.9 million or 60% of operating profit into\nProducer Partner Programmes in the 3 years to 2007. Since its IPO in 2004, it have also\nhanded over a portion of its share issue to the producer community - 4.9 % of equity - in order\nto give producers a role in the governance of the organisation.\nThe company now attempts to leverage stories of sustainability and shared ownership in its\nmarketing communications as reasons why people should preferentially buy \u201cBrand\nCaf\u00e9direct\u201d over other competing products. As a consequence, Caf\u00e9direct\u2019s physical\nproducts are no longer featured in today\u2019s advertising.\nThe transition to corporate marketing communications based on uniqueness has been a\ngradual process. In many ways, there has always been an undercurrent of this but over the last\n5 years, the vast majority of Caf\u00e9direct\u2019s advertising has been based on \u201cevents\u201d and big\nextravaganzas. Examples of this include the extent to which they have involved themselves\nwith the Glastonbury Rock Festival and the Edinburgh Fringe. One major investment has\nbeen on \u201cThe Lift\u201d (pictured in Figure 5a with the comedy group The Pineapple Boys) which\nis a miniature entertainment venue where small audiences (as many as will fit) are treated to\n16\nlive entertainment. It is quite literally a lift making the Caf\u00e9direct \u2018experience\u2019 somewhat\navant-garde and a magnet for drawing press attention.\nFigure 5b: Uniqueness: A selection of press coverage of Caf\u00e9direct\u2019s\nmarketing activities\nFigure 5a: The Lift\n17\nFollowing on from the Lift as a venue, Caf\u00e9direct took over the London Eye in 2005 with\neach pod representing a venue for entertainers (following the example of The Lift). Samples\nof press coverage from Caf\u00e9direct\u2019s annual report in that year are shown in Figure 5b. Figure\n5b also shows a Daily Mirror front cover with the transformation of Madonna into an African\nwoman in a major piece of PR for Caf\u00e9direct:\nBrand Location in Store\nSupermarkets were one of the first commercial business customers to expand the sales of fair\ntrade and to validate Caf\u00e9direct as an alternative, mass-market business model rather than a\nniche offering. However, this distribution channel in itself threw up some business and ethical\nproblems. Many people within the fair trade movement believed that working with\nsupermarkets was hypocritical. When trying to demonstrate a better way of trading and\nsupporting growers, working with organisations famous for their tight financial control over\nsuppliers was regarded as questionable. In addition, to ensure sales were high enough to keep\nthem on the supermarket stocking list meant encouraging existing consumers to move away\nfrom the independent and highly supportive World Shops to buy Caf\u00e9direct products at their\nlocal supermarkets. At the same time, the company also had to create awareness of their range\namong supermarket shoppers quickly and to persuade them to buy their products. Convincing\ncampaigners to stand outside supermarkets and talk to people into buying fair trade on a one-\nto-one basis was certainly not unusual. In fact, during those early days, Caf\u00e9direct was lucky\nenough to have a group of devoted volunteer campaigners willing to brave wet February\nmornings during the Fairtrade Fortnight, an annual event aimed at raising fair trade\nawareness, to promote its brand. Many of these supporters were from the partner\norganisations Oxfam and Traidcraft.\nRather surprisingly, one of the biggest challenges faced by Caf\u00e9direct was to get its products\nsituated appropriately in store. A great deal of confusion existed (and in some cases it still\ndoes) as to what fair trade actually is! Many supermarkets stack their fair trade ranges on\nshelves displaying such things as Organics, Health foods and Ethnic produce. In fact, the aim\nwith most Fairtrade\u00a9 Marked brands has always been for them to sit alongside the\nmainstream brands and not elsewhere as an ethical, niche brand. By the time Caf\u00e9direct was\ncreating tea brands in the late 1990s, ethical consumers were no longer its target market.\nConvincing every supermarket shopper that fair trade was simply a better way of consuming\n18\nbecame the new mantra. Thus, wherever the mainstream brands were sold, Caf\u00e9direct wanted\nto be there too.\nIn 2000, Caf\u00e9direct entered into a partnership with Costa Coffee to sell fair trade coffee as a\nmenu option throughout their estate of UK coffee shops. This market sector is termed \u201cout-of-\nhome\u201d and, in recent years, has been the strongest growth sector for Caf\u00e9direct, with them\nenjoying sales of \u00a34.6m in 2007 from a base of around \u00a30.5m five years earlier. New\nproducts developed for vending machines and catering packs for cafes, restaurants, planes and\ntrains are the key reasons behind this growth.\nThus, Caf\u00e9direct\u2019s approach to distribution has been a vital element in shifting fair trade\nproducts into mainstream consumption. The company was able to convince trade buyers and\nconsumers alike that it is not just a niche brand but a mass-market competitor with a unique\nselling proposition. How this message has been successfully communicated over time is of\ncritical importance for Caf\u00e9direct. For a relatively new company with a workforce that has\nnever risen above 35 people, this is a bold marketing and sales position to have adopted and\nhas been achieved by giving the impression of size through its extensive use of networks.\nCaf\u00e9direct\u2019s Networks through its Business Development Cycle\nCaf\u00e9direct were founded as a joint venture between four organisations with different\ncapabilities. With Twin Trading as their supply chain partner, they needed no buyers or\nsupply chain managers (or plantations for that matter). In fact, Caf\u00e9direct was, and still is, a\nvirtual organisation. Currently, Keith Spicer7 manufacture, package and distribute their teas\nand Gala8 roast, grind, package and distribute their coffees. This enables Caf\u00e9direct to remain\nsmall and entirely marketing and demand management focused. It has meant that the\ncompany can appear to the market as a much larger organisation than it is through the use of\nexisting business networks and links to the market. This has given the company greater\ncredibility and market impact despite only being a small, entrepreneurial business. Over its\nbusiness development cycle, Caf\u00e9direct has gone through three distinct stages in its network\nusage which reflect its marketing developments previously discussed.\n1. The solidarity launch stage: Caf\u00e9direct\u2019s business network\n19\nDuring its launch, most of Caf\u00e9direct\u2019s partners were from an Alternative Trading\nOrganisation (ATO) background. All of the supply chain, sales and marketing was conducted\nby other organisations, in particular, Caf\u00e9direct\u2019s founding partners. Even manufacturers like\nNorthern Tea Merchants had long-standing relationships with fair trade having been the\nmanufacturer of Equal Exchange and Traidcraft coffee prior to Caf\u00e9direct\u2019s involvement (see\nFigure 6). This network is consistent with the marketing and branding of Caf\u00e9direct during\nthe fair trade solidarity period.\n2. Caf\u00e9direct\u2019s business network during its market development growth phase\nDuring this growth stage, Caf\u00e9direct began to assume more responsibility for sales and\nmarketing, taking away the initiative from its founding partners. The company also started to\nrely less on ATOs for retailing its products or advertising its brands as they move more\ntowards traditional style advertising, such as posters and print adverts, and mass-market\ndistributors. They also partnered with Coffee Fresh9 for vending machine distribution and had\nan agreement with Costa Coffee to ensure distribution in the growing market for coffee shops.\nIn order to develop the market for both its own brands and the fair trade category in general,\ndistribution was widened and Caf\u00e9direct\u2019s marketing and sales resources were increased by\nintroducing more commercial partners into the network and reducing its commitments to the\nATOs (see Figure 7).\nGrowers - Northern Tea\nMerchants\n-Gala\nWorld Shops\nEqual Exchange\nTwin\nTrading\nCaf\u00e9direct Supermarkets\nCharity Shops\nHealth food\nTraidcraft\nOxfam Church Groups\nFairtrade\nFortnight\nPrint Ads.\nVolunteers Mail OrderCaf\u00e9direct Owners\nEqual Exchange 25%\nTwin Trading 25%\nOxfam 25%\nTraidcraft 25%\nPR\nSupply chain\nManufacture \/\nDistribution Marketing Retailers\nAdvertising \/\npromotionSales\nKey: Commercial Partner\nAlternative Trading Organisations and charities\nFigure 6: Caf\u00e9direct\u2019s Original Business Network\n20\n3. Caf\u00e9direct\u2019s current business network during its mass-market stage\nCurrently, there is a clear shift away from the company\u2019s original fair trade founders to other\ntypes of trading partners (both commercial and ATOs) as it competes in the mass-market. In\npromoting and advertising the brand, Caf\u00e9direct has sought to develop increasingly avant-\ngarde partners, such as the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, Glastonbury Rock Festival, G8, and\norganisations including the London Eye and the Guardian Newspaper (who now hold a board\nseat) in order to gain significant levels of free advertising space (or a very much reduced cost)\nin prime locations (including newspaper front covers, festival stages and endorsements). The\ncompany has also begun to involve itself in many issues beyond the fair trade agenda, such as\ncontributing to the climate change debate with partner GTZ, getting involved in the Sri\nLankan Tsunami Appeal and the Kenyan civil strife following the 2008 election. The senior\nmanagement of Caf\u00e9direct are also now consulting with The Department for International\nDevelopment (DfID) on health and poverty issues in Africa (see Figure 8 for Caf\u00e9direct\u2019s\ncurrent business networks). Arguably, this strategy once again starts to push the company\nback towards the charity-style public image they once tried so hard to cast off. However, one\nof the differences now is that the people involved in the company are no longer ATO workers\nwith experience working in Africa (as they were in the beginning), but former sales and\nmarketing managers from GlaxoSmithKline, Mars and Nestl\u00e9 and other multinationals.\nOver time, Caf\u00e9direct has effected very significant changes in the type of companies it\nnetworks with and the ways in which these networks are leveraged.

All of whom\npartnered with Caf\u00e9direct as part of a transformative movement to build an alternative to\nconventional international trade, ultimately leading to the presence of Caf\u00e9direct on\nsupermarket shelves and movement into the mainstream. For example, for many years,\nFairtrade Fortnight (as mentioned earlier) was the principle means of promotion. For two\nweeks each year, all the licensed members of the Fairtrade Foundation join together to\npromote one common message; an effective method of promoting the idea of size and\ncohesion which really does not exist across the fair trade market. PR contacts and volunteer\nsales forces were also key to the network in the early stages. To a certain extent, this original\nmarketing strategy was driven by cost because, as a small business, Caf\u00e9direct could not\nafford expensive sales and marketing. Also, weight was added to Caf\u00e9direct\u2019s sustainability\nclaims by using church groups and other charities to advertise their products.\nNow, the influence of the founding partners of the company has been significantly reduced.\nFor instance, Equal Exchange the original sales and marketing team for Caf\u00e9direct, is no\nlonger involved in running the company. Shortly after moving to London, Caf\u00e9direct\neffectively curtailed its relationship by only allowing them to act as the distributor for\nCaf\u00e9direct brands into the catering, health and wholefood markets. Within a couple of years,\nthe company had effectively by-passed even this arrangement with Equal Exchange by\nagreeing to supply direct to their biggest customer (Suma). Caf\u00e9direct has not only reduced its\nuse of the founders\u2019 sales and marketing teams, it has also begun to formalise their\nrelationships with them by using service level agreements in place of the trust-based\nagreements. At precisely the same time as these events, Caf\u00e9direct converted from private to\npublic ownership, reducing each of the founding partners from 25% share to 10% share in the\ncompany and reducing their position on the Board to one representative.\n22\nCaf\u00e9direct has moved away from the ATOs to more traditional business partners such as\nBridgeThorne (outsourced retails sales and distribution), Coffee fresh (vending machines) and\nselling directly to Suma (major warehouse and distribution centres for independent retailers.\nAs the range of partners that Caf\u00e9direct works with increases dramatically, they are beginning\nto look more like any other small coffee business as they make connections to advance the\ncommercial aspects of the firm whilst concentrating less on the ethical image they had\nportrayed in the past.\nCaf\u00e9direct: Where to next?\nCaf\u00e9direct has been a huge marketing success story. They have consistently grown far faster\nthan the total market although not necessarily as fast as some competitors (see Table 2). In\n2008, the former CEO was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE10)\nAward, after overseeing the vastly over-subscribed initial public offering for Caf\u00e9direct in\n2004. Caf\u00e9direct paid its first dividend in 2005- much too many investors\u2019 surprise -despite\nthe increase pressures from competition and was also voted number one most-recommended\nUK brand by a Millward Brown consumer market survey in 2007.\nGrowers\n- Keith Spicer\n- Gala\nTwin\nTrading\nCaf\u00e9direct\nSuma\nFairtrade\nFortnight\nPRCaf\u00e9direct Owners\nEqual Exchange 10%\nTwin Trading 10%\nOxfam 10%\nTraidcraft 10%\nPrivate 60%\nPostersCoffee Fresh\nEndorsement\nEvent\nSponsorship\nEvent\nManagement\nPrint Ads.\nAirplanes and Airports\nCafes Restaurants\nCaterers\nCaf\u00e9direct Coffee Bars\nNon-Trading Partners\nGTZ (climate control program)\nGuardian Newspaper (hold a board seat)\nDivine Chocolate (Sister Company)\nDfID (Consultation Partner)\nKey: Commercial Partner\nAlternative Trading Organisations and charities\nSupply chain\nManufacture \/\nDistribution Marketing Retailers\nAdvertising \/\npromotionSales\nWorld Shops\nSupermarkets\nCharity Shops\nHealth \/ Whole food\nMail Order\nIndependents Grocers\nBridgeThorne\nFigure 8: Caf\u00e9direct\u2019s current business network\n23\nIn 2006, the company made its first after-tax loss since 1995(see financial results in Figure 9).\nDuring 2007, retail sales actually fell 4% for the first time in the company\u2019s history to \u00a317.0\nmillion which must be viewed with some concern as 70% of total company turnover is via the\nretail channel. Fairtrade\u00a9 coffee at retail level overall is still growing at 33% volume and\n24% retail (Fairtrade Foundation, 2008); Caf\u00e9direct does not seem to be capitalising on this\nand is also feeling the effects of increasing competition from both like-for-like fair trade\ngoods, including supermarket own-label fair trade products, and new, sustainable coffees.\nTable 2:Market share (by value) of coffee by manufacturer: 2003-07\nCompany \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m\n%\nchange\n%\nchange\n2003 2005 2007 2003-07 2005-07\nNestl\u00e9 294 308 304 3.4 -1.3\nKraft 126 128 139 10.3 8.6\nDouwe Egberts 27 40 47 74.1 17.5\nCaf\u00e9direct 7 8 10 28.6 12.5\nTaylors 8 8 10 37.5 37.5\nLavazza 8 8 11 37.5 37.5\nGala (Lyons) 6 5 4 -33.3 -20\nFood Brands Group (Percol) 5 5 5 0 0\nOwn-label 88 104 122 38.6 17.3\nOthers 44 56 68 54.5 21.4\nTotal 613 670 720 17.5 7.5\nSource: Adapted from Mintel 2008\n24\nFor instance, thirty nine percent of fair trade coffee sales are now accounted for by\nsupermarket own-label brands. In fact, forecast data for Fairtrade\u00a9 coffee in general does not\nlook encouraging with a gradual slowing of growth which could reduce even faster if the\n2006\/ 2007 trend continues (see Figure 10, long-dash line). Since 2005 Caf\u00e9direct have\nactually underperformed in terms of growth compared to fair trade in general (Fairtrade\ngrowth rate = 8% per year, Caf\u00e9direct growth rate = 6-7% per year), they have also grown\nrelatively conservatively compared to the rest of the coffee market (Figure 10), Similarly,\nalthough the predicted growth in coffee shops is still strong (bold line), this growth is\ndefinitely slowing too, indicating near-saturated markets in both retail and out-of-home coffee\nconsumption. This could be an issue for Caf\u00e9direct as they have recently started investing in\ntheir own high street coffee shops to take advantage of this growing market.\n-\n5,000\n10,000\n15,000\n20,000\n25,000\n1998 1999 2000 2001* 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007\nYear\n\u00a3,\n00\n0 Turnover\nGross Profit\nOperating Profit\n* Adjusted from 18 month to 12 month reported period\nFigure 9: Caf\u00e9direct\u2019s Financial Results\n25\nThere is also a problem in the target age group for coffee consumption amongst the\ndemographic group called the Thirdage (hashed line of Figure 10) as there is actually a\npredicted fall in this age bracket of people 45 years and older. This may have a double impact\non Caf\u00e9direct as fair trade itself is more attractive to Thirdage consumers than other\ndemographic groups (Nichols and Opal, 2005; Strong, 1996; 1997). Taken together, these\nmarket predictions adversely impact on the overall market forecast for coffee sales (short-\ndash line), making coffee a far less attractive market than it was a few years ago.\nThrough its current and past networks, Caf\u00e9direct has been able to convince their stakeholders\nthat it is a much larger business than it really is. It has been able to cast off its charity image\nfor a professionalism not seen previously in fair trade companies, and has exploited just about\nevery opportunity to expand its public profile whilst growing its contacts at governmental,\nindustrial and consumer levels. Caf\u00e9direct now buys from 39 producer organisations\nrepresenting over 250,000 growers from 13 different countries (Caf\u00e9direct, 2007), and the fair\ntrade movement is now generally recognised as an alternative approach to traditional trading\nmodels (Moore, 2004; Nicholls and Opal, 2005; Raynolds et al, 2007). However, competing\nethical claim certification marks are now entering the market (e.g. Rainforest Alliance11, Utz\nKapeh12 and the coffee industry\u2019s 4C code) which is introducing greater competition.

A supermarket buyer offered the opinion that, \u201cfair trade consumers just do\nnot seem to trust the Nestl\u00e9 brand\u201d (interviewed in February 2009).\nIn the face of this increasing market threats, we are seeing the current Caf\u00e9direct management\nteam expanding its ethical message by engaging in broader issues such as ethical\nconsumption, overseas development aid and human rights issues\u2026.. as well as climate change\nthrough its involvement with DfID and GTZ.\nThe company has also to deal with the negative publicity about fair trade that appears in the\npress from time to time, such as the accusation that fair trade is not living up to its promises to\ngrowers or that it is been subverted by multinational organisations (Nestl\u00e9 \u201cPartners\u2019 Blend\u201d\nbeing awarded the Fairtrade\u00a9 Mark). Fair trade organisations are sometimes criticised for\n\u2018colluding\u2019 with the supermarkets by \u2018agreeing to\u2019 the profit levels supermarkets achieve on\nfair trade products (BBC, 2006). Caf\u00e9direct has even been accused of destabilising the market\nby swimming counter to market economics, representing nothing more than protectionism\nand, as such, damaging free trade across the whole coffee market (Kappler, 2001, CBI and\nBritish Soluble Coffee Manufacturers\u2019 Association in The Guardian, 1998, p.22). However\nthis argument assumes that free trade was working in the first place. For small-scale coffee\nfarmers receiving less for their product than it has cost them to produce sustainably, it\u2019s hard\nto see how this can work for such communities (Brown, 1993).\nConclusions\nAs a case study, this paper attempts to explain Caf\u00e9direct\u2019s rise from obscurity to become the\nchampion brand of the fair trade movement in the UK. Through the use of networks and the\nways in which the company leverages its Fairtrade\u00a9 status demonstrates great creativity and\ningenuity which can be generally characterised as an aggressive, market-orientated approach.\nHowever, the case also presents a microcosm of the issues surrounding ethical brand\nmanagement. Caf\u00e9direct could only rely on core product ethics (being fair trade) and ethical\nmessages to deliver a very limited market share. Product quality and corporate identity,\ncombined with strong distribution and consumer awareness, have proved more important in\nachieving a greater market share and sales growth; Caf\u00e9direct has had to adapt its business\n27\nmodel and core messaging to reflect this. The people within the organisation have also had to\nadapt to these changing market conditions.\nDespite the flexibility of the Caf\u00e9direct management and the companies strong brand\ncredentials, it is facing a number of challenges as a result of mainstreaming. Its first challenge\nis to maintain its unique ethical edge. Although Caf\u00e9direct today is more heavily sales driven\nthan the charities and ATOs that founded the organisation were, is it fair to argue that its\nengagement with mainstream business has led to a dilution of the fair trade movement (Lowe\nand Davenport 2005a, 2005b, Moore et al 2006, Murray et al 2006, Taylor et al 2005)?\nCertainly, Caf\u00e9direct\u2019s structures and processes for selling its products are not particularly\ndifferent to any other mainstream consumer business. Nevertheless, its ownership and\nengagement with supply chain development issues through PPP and Gold Standard suggest\nthat its claim to be the authentic voice for subsistence growers is certainly as strong today as it\nalways has been. However, the company is now competing against other organisations within\nthe fair trade movement, unlike in earlier times where all fair trade companies presented a\nunited front (Davies, 2007). Especially if the coffee market goes the way of the chocolate\nmarket where big brand leaders ( in this case Cadbury\u2019s) convert their mainstream brands to\nfair trade. To a certain extent, this forces the company to adopt a defensive strategy to help\nprotect its brand and it\u2019s now not insubstantial revenues. It is telling that the new CEO\n(formerly from Ribena) is an experienced consumer goods marketer, skilled in protecting\nmarket share rather than an entrepreneur experienced at growing an ethical business.\nThe second challenge faced by Caf\u00e9direct in mainstreaming is whether or not it is clean-\nwashing its partner organisations (Murray and Raynolds, 2000; Golding and Peattie, 2005;\nValor, 2006). Unlike its sister company Divine Chocolate, Caf\u00e9direct does not directly license\nits products to other organisations for own-label production. It does, however, provide the\nopportunity for organisations in its network partnership to gain reputational benefits whilst\ncontributing very little to the movement. An extreme example of this is an airline\ndemonstrating commitment to sustainability by having fair trade coffee on-board, perhaps in\nan attempt to deflect attention from other environmental issues.\nThe third challenge may be about survival of the company rather than promoting development\nof the fair trade movement. Ultimately, Caf\u00e9direct is one of the companies that set the\nstandards for what fair trade has become. This case demonstrates that if the movement wishes\n28\nto have a large market presence, it has to embrace a mainstream approach. Fair trade has\ngravitated towards being heavily brand-orientated in competitive market segments which\neffectively negate the notion of being a united movement. Within these segments, brands\nmust fight for market position which means there may well be limits to size since as soon as\nthe market segment becomes big and profitable enough, large commercial brands can quickly\nenter and draw a larger share of that market. (Currently, the FLO does not limit the number of\nlicenses available to suitable applicants). Whilst it is possible to sustain a number 1 or 2 brand\nposition within a segment, ultimately, company survival and profitability depends upon\noccupying multiple market segments (Aaker, 2004); niche brands are usually viable within a\nmainstream market segment but niche companies are not.\nThe final challenge raised in this case is whether consumers can variously differentiate\nbetween not only competing ethical claims (i.e. the new ethical labels) but also the number of\nclaims that they can willingly process. Moore et al. (2006) calls for fair trade to show unity in\nfair trade messaging to ensure its survival as a distinct product offering. At Caf\u00e9direct, there\nhas been a movement towards corporate ethics as its unique differentiator leading to an\ninvolvement in numerous ethical activities and promoting this engagement over a broader\nseries of sustainability issues. Davies and Crane (2003) discussed the idea of ring-fencing the\nfair trade ideology behind a \u201cmoral curtain\u201d and really promoting that message over all other\nactivities. In writing this case, we cannot readily identify whether Caf\u00e9direct\u2019s corporate\nmarketing activities about its various positions on global ethical issues is having an impact on\nthe slowing of sales growth since there are too many other factors at play in the market.\nHowever, evidence from Mintel (2008) would suggest the majority of customers are not\nsufficiently savvy to comprehend multiple messages on ethical or sustainability issues (e.g.\nconfusing organics and fair trade).\n29\nAppendix 1: Methodology\nThe data used in this case study come from two longitudinal, exploratory studies into the\nmanagement and implementation of strategy in Caf\u00e9direct over the periods of 1999-2004 and\n1999-2008 respectively.\nThe methodology used in both studies involved the researchers gaining privileged access to\nthe company to develop a deep understanding of the organisational phenomena (Glaser,\n1992). A case study approach was, therefore, selected as the principal method of gaining in-\ndepth information (Yin, 1994). Data sources were wide ranging, including not only primary\nqualitative data (observation, interviews and attendance at corporate events) but also annual\nreports, company reports, secondary data, and statistics and surveys providing information of\nrelevance to the study (Goulding, 2001). These supplementary data sources provide some of\nthe background as well as further verification of our findings from the qualitative works.\nNevertheless, the methods of enquiry are predominantly qualitative in order to gain this rich\ncontextual understanding to promote revelatory case insight (Mintzberg, 1979, and Van\nMaanan, 1979).\nThe predominant qualitative methods used in each study were:\nStudy 1 - participant and personal observation recorded through formal and reflexive research\ndiaries spanning a period of nine years and semi-structured interview technique;\nStudy 2 - participant observation included work shadowing in the sales and marketing\ndepartment, touring with the marketing team at public events such as the Edinburgh Fringe\nFestival and The Lift venues (see later), participation in team and external \/ network\norganisation meetings and working from the head office on marketing and research activities\nand semi-structure interviews.\nIn total, the observation leads to over 1000 hours contact time over the two studies as well as\ninformal observation from the authors\u2019 cumulative experience of 20 years working within and\nobserving the fair trade movement.\nThe semi-structured interviews also carried out consisted of 12 formal interviews within\nCaf\u00e9direct and 42 supplementary and validating interviews across the marketplace, from\nsupply chain participants to the fair trade establishment. Key informants include past and\npresent personnel at Caf\u00e9direct, the company\u2019s founders, the Fairtrade Foundation, other fair\n30\ntrade companies, competitors, supermarket buyers, supermarket ethical trading managers, a\ntrading manager from a UK Coffee shop chain and established independent retailers. All\ninterviews were recorded.\nTo ensure internal validity and reliability, a constant comparative method borrowed from\ngrounded theory was utilised for both studies collectively (Barnes, 1996) multiple responses\nfrom different people within the same organisation were compared against each other, field\nnotes and secondary sources. We subsequently interpreted these data outputs and provided\nunderlying rationales for the companies actions from the data (Rubin and Rubin, 1995,\nEisenhardt, 1989). External validity and reliability was increased through triangulation with\nboth secondary sources and formal interviews with appropriate third parties (such as network\npartners) to ensure greater rigour in the findings and conclusions (Askey and Knight 1999).\nInterviews were transcribed and run through a series of categorisation, abstraction, and\ncomparison processes to identify themes which contribute to theory development (Spiggle,\n1994). Aspects of theory were then reviewed iteratively to decide on the direction of future\ndata collection and emergent themes were then put to participants for review and refinement\nprior to writing this final version of the case study.\n31\nAppendix 2: Teaching Appendix\nSuggested Questions:\nDo you think companies in an ethical niche have to compromise their ethics when competing\nin the mainstream?\nLooking back at Caf\u00e9direct\u2019s market development, would you have done things differently if\nyou had been in charge? If you were to have been offered the CEO role in 2008 when it\nbecame available, what would you do differently at Caf\u00e9direct?\nFor Business Ethics Course:\na) Caf\u00e9direct has been a clear success and is held up as an archetype case for \u201cethical\nbusiness\u201d, but is it really any different from other competitors that enjoys a unique selling\nproposition? Has fair trade reached its natural limit when codes such as the 4C (Common\nCode for the Coffee Community - http:\/\/www.4c-coffeeassociation.org\/en\/association.htm)\nare put in place to govern the entire coffee market with similar rhetoric to the Fairtrade\u00a9\nprinciples?\nb) As a marketing and logistics company, what should Caf\u00e9direct\u2019s responsibilities be?\nConsider:\ni. Are they an appropriate organisation to be advising the government on African\ndevelopment?\nii. Should they be getting involved in climate change discussions or is this diluting their\ncore purpose?\niii. Can single issue brands still compete in an ever more complex and diversified\nmarket?\nFor Marketing Ethics Course:\nDiscussion:\nDavies and Crane (2003) discuss the idea of a \u201cMoral Curtain\u201d where, by ring fencing a\nsingle issue (the marginalisation of growing communities) and really promoting this, fair\ntrade companies can achieve success over time by allowing other areas of the business to\n32\nmimic traditional business models whilst the company itself remains perceived as an\n\u201cethical brand\u201d.\nHas this been happening in Caf\u00e9direct? Does an involvement in ancillary campaigns, such as\nclimate change, weaken their market proposition?\nFor Marketing Course:\nYou have been appointed as the new Marketing Director of Caf\u00e9direct with the specific brief\nto get both profits and sales back on track. Your brief allows you to consider all aspects of\nthe company\u2019s business and marketing strategy and there are no \u2018no go\u2019 areas. Fortuitously,\none of the world\u2019s leading marketing services company has offered their extensive market\nresearch resources to you for free \u2013 both qualitative and quantitative \u2013as part of their global\nsustainability programme. So, as a first step in managing change in Caf\u00e9direct\u2019s marketing\nstrategy, you decide to draw up a MR brief for the agency.
