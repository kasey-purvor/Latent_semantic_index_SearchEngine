The model is built around a partition of precipitation into components for 16 \noverland flow (infiltration excess, saturation excess and snowmelt), evapotranspiration 17 \nand changes in soil moisture storage.  Transpiration is used to drive a generic plant 18 \ngrowth model for biomass, constrained as necessary by land use decisions, primarily 19 \non a monthly time step. Leaf fall, with corrections for cropping, grazing etc, also drives 20 \na simple model for soil organic matter.  The runoff threshold for infiltration excess 21 \noverland flow depends on vegetation cover,  organic matter and soil properties, varying 22 \ndynamically over the year, and drives overland flow using the distribution of daily rain 23 \namounts.  Total erosion is driven by erodibility, derived from soil properties, powered 24 \noverland flow discharge and gradient; and is assessed at the slope base to estimate total 25 \nPage 2\/39 \nloss from the land.    The model is run, using monthly averages and distributions of 26 \ndaily precipitation, to equilibrium in order to estimate long term averages, and is being 27 \nvalidated against the limited erosion data available.  Data sources, uniformly available 28 \nacross Europe,  include the European Soils Data base, CORINE land use, MARS 50 29 \nkm interpolated climate data and 90m DEM (SRTM). 30 \n 31 \n 32 \nIntroduction 33 \nSoil erosion has long been identified as an important global issue, with implications for 34 \nthe maintenance of fertile soil and crop yields (e.g. Bennett, 1939 for North America, 35 \nSeely and Wohl, 2004  for semi-arid and arid areas worldwide).  Early models, 36 \nparticularly the USLE and its derivatives (Wischmeier and Smith, 1958, 1978;  Renard 37 \net al, 1991) focussed on a broad-scale approach which could be readily applied in a 38 \nwide range of conditions to give advice of conservation practice.  Much of the more 39 \nrecent work has, however, concentrated on detailed process models (eg. WEPP, 40 \nNearing et al 1989; EUROSEM, Morgan et al, 1994; KINEROS, Smith et al, 1995; 41 \nLISEM, de Roo, 1996) which have progressively incorporated improving knowledge 42 \nof processes for runoff generation and sediment transport, but which lack the ease of 43 \napplication to new sites poor in data. 44 \n 45 \nHere we present a theoretical framework for developing a simplified process based 46 \nmodel, in particular providing explicit dependence on climate and vegetation, and 47 \nimplement this model as a 1-km resolution model across most of Europe.  This paper 48 \ndescribes the innovative aspects and theoretical background to the model, and a 49 \nPage 3\/39 \ncompanion paper will describe its performance, calibration scenario application at the 50 \nEuropean scale. 51 \n 52 \nThe PESERA model (Pan\u2013European Soil Erosion Risk Assessment) is a physically 53 \nbased and spatial distributed model developed to quantify soil erosion of 54 \nenvironmentally sensitive areas relevant to a regional or European scale and define soil 55 \nconservation strategies. The current version of model was developed within the 56 \nstructure of the PESERA project (contract No QLK5-CT-1999-01323) funded by the 57 \nEuropean Commission, Research Directorates General, DG VI (Quality of Life and 58 \nManagement of Living Resources),  and was also based on previous funded and un-59 \nfunded research (Kirkby and Neale, 1987; de Ploey et al, 1991; Kirkby and Cox, 1995; 60 \nKirkby et al, 2000).  The PESERA model combines the effect of topography, climate, 61 \nvegetation cover and soil into a single integrated forecast of runoff and soil erosion 62 \n 63 \nThe importance of soil erosion at a regional scale 64 \nErosion by running water has been identified as the most severe hazard threatening  the 65 \nprotection of soil in Europe (EC, 2006).  By removing the most fertile topsoil, erosion 66 \nreduces soil productivity leading, where soils are shallow, to a progressive and ultimately 67 \nirreversible loss of natural farmland, and in vulnerable areas, is one major process of 68 \ndesertification.   Severe erosion is commonly associated with the development of temporary 69 \nor permanently eroded channels or gullies which can fragment farmland.  The soil and 70 \nrunoff removed from the land during a large storm accumulates below the eroded areas, 71 \nspilling offsite and in severe cases blocking roadways or channels and inundating buildings.   72 \nErosion rate is very sensitive to both climate and land use, as well as to detailed 73 \nconservation practice at farm level.  In a period of rapid changes in both climate and land 74 \nPage 4\/39 \nuse, due to global change, revised agricultural policies and international markets, it is 75 \nvaluable to be able to assess the state of soil erosion at a European level, using an objective 76 \nmethodology which allows the assessment to be repeated as conditions; pressures and 77 \ndrivers, change, or to explore the broad scale implications of prospective global or Europe-78 \nwide changes.  This provides an estimate of the overall costs attributable to erosion under 79 \npresent and changed conditions, and objectively suggests areas for more detailed study and 80 \npossible remedial action.   81 \n 82 \nThe PESERA model provides such an objective estimate of current rates of soil 83 \nerosion, averaged over a series of years with current climate and land use.  European 84 \nestimates have been made at a resolution of 1  kilometre, and indicate the rate of loss of 85 \nmaterial from hillsides.   Sediment delivery through the river system is explicitly not 86 \ntaken into account, and most of the eroded material generally remains close to its 87 \nsource, with significant off-site effects generally confined to a local area. 88 \n 89 \nProcess model approach 90 \nThere are a number of possible methodologies for creating a coarse scale erosion map 91 \n(Gobin et al, 2004).    Some of these are based on the collection of distributed field 92 \nobservations, others on an assessment of factors, and combinations of factors, which 93 \ninfluence erosion rates, and others primarily on a modelling approach.  All of these 94 \nmethods require calibration and validation, although the type of validation needed is 95 \ndifferent for each category.  There are also differences in the extent to which the 96 \nassessment methods identify past erosion of an already degraded soil resource, as 97 \nopposed to risks of future erosion, under either present climate and land use, or under 98 \nPage 5\/39 \nscenarios of global change.  Here  a physically-based process model is presented, 99 \nwithin the limitations of resolution and available data. 100 \n 101 \n 102 \nProcess models have the potential to respond explicitly and rationally to changes in  climate 103 \nor land use, and so have great promise for developing scenarios of change, and what-if 104 \nanalyses of policy or economic options.  Set against this advantage, process models 105 \ngenerally make no assessment of degradation up to the present time, and can only 106 \nincorporate the impact of past erosion where this is recorded in other data, such as soils data 107 \nbases.  Models also generally simplify the set of processes operating, so that they may not be 108 \nappropriate under particular local circumstances.  Although the USLE and RUSLE have 109 \nbeen the most widely applied models in Europe (e.g. van der Knijf et al, 2000) , this 110 \napproach is now widely considered to be conceptually flawed, and other models are now 111 \nemerging, based on runoff thresholds (e.g. Kirkby at al, 2000) or the MIR(Minimum 112 \nInformation Requirement) approach (Brazier et al, 2001) applied to the more complex 113 \nUSDA WEPP model (Nearing et al, 1989). 114 \n 115 \nThe application of a process model has been preferred here for three main reasons. 116 \n1. It applies the same objective criteria to all areas, and so can be applied throughout a 117 \nregion, subject to the availability of suitable generic data. 118 \n2. It provides a quantitative estimate of erosion rate which can be compared with long 119 \nterm averages for tolerable erosion. 120 \n3. The methodology can be re-applied with equal consistency as available  data sources 121 \nare improved, and for past  and present scenarios of changed climate and land use. 122 \n 123 \nPage 6\/39 \n 124 \nPoint hydrology  and land cover 125 \nThe model presented represents a fundamental advance on previous models of comparable 126 \nsimplicity, most notably the USLE and its derivatives, by explicitly separating hydrology 127 \nfrom sediment transport.  That is to say that it first estimates storm overland flow runoff, and 128 \nthen uses the runoff to estimate sediment transport.  Soil properties therefore enter separately 129 \ninto these two stages, replacing the separation in USLE between erosivity as a purely 130 \nclimatic property and erodibility as a pure soil property. 131 \n 132 \nAt the same time, the PESERA model has been designed to provide an estimate of long term 133 \nerosion and must therefore scale up from our knowledge of instantaneous sediment transport 134 \nas a function of shear stress or flow power to firstly an aggregate relationship between event 135 \ndischarge and event sediment discharge, and secondly from single events to the aggregate of 136 \nstorm events across the relevant distribution of storms.  This temporal scaling up provides 137 \nthe essential link between climate, defined by the distribution of rainfall events and long 138 \nterm sediment transport.  Although this scaling up has been discussed and partially 139 \nimplemented in previous models (Kirkby Kirkby et al, 1996; Kirkby, 1998), it has not 140 \npreviously been applied within a soil erosion model. 141 \n 142 \nRunoff in a single storm 143 \nFigure 1 outlines the hydrological balance within the PESERA model.  Precipitation is 144 \ndivided into daily storm events, expressed as a frequency distribution, that drive infiltration 145 \noverland flow and soil erosion, and monthly precipitation, some of which may be as snow, 146 \ndriving saturation levels in the soil.  Infiltration excess overland flow runoff is estimated 147 \nfrom storm rainfall and soil moisture.  Sediment transport is then estimated from overland 148 \nPage 7\/39 \nflow and routed, in principle, downslope.   Alternative methods for making these estimated 149 \nare discussed below. To obtain long term estimates of soil erosion these estimates must then 150 \nbe scaled up by integrating over time.  This process of scaling up has two stages, first from 151 \nmomentary to event-integrated dependence, and secondly from events to long term averages 152 \nvia the frequency distribution.  For the first stage, if instantaneous sediment discharge can be 153 \nexpressed as a power law dependence on instantaneous water discharge, the relationship 154 \nbetween event total sediment discharge and event total discharge will, in general, also be a 155 \npower law, but the exponent will differ according to how hydrograph form changes with 156 \nflood volume.  Table 1 indicates how different generalisations of storm profile influence the 157 \nrelationship between instantaneous and time-averaged exponents.  Other possibilities exist if 158 \nthere are thresholds for movement and\/or hysteretic sediment stores, but in general it is 159 \nreasonable to assume a similar power law relationship between sediment transport and 160 \ndischarge for event totals as for instantaneous values, but with some modification to allow 161 \nfor systematic changes in hydrograph shape. 162 \n  163 \nIn the second stage of scaling up, individual storm totals are integrated over the frequency 164 \ndistribution of storms.  Two assumptions are normally made, first that the distribution of 165 \nstorms can be replaced by the distribution of daily rainfalls, and second that overland flow 166 \ncan be estimated on the basis of monthly average soil moisture conditions.  The first of these 167 \nassumptions avoids the discussion of how rainfall is divided, more or less arbitrarily, into 168 \nstorm events.  The use of a daily unit is both convenient, in that daily rainfall data is 169 \nrelatively widely available, and appropriate in the sense that bursts of rainfall within a single 170 \nday are significantly influenced by raised soil moisture levels from previous bursts, whereas 171 \nfor longer periods there may be significant drying between bursts.  Similarly monthly 172 \nupdating of soil moisture is sufficient to reflect important seasonal differences in weather, to 173 \nPage 8\/39 \nrespond to seasonal differences in land cover and to make use of widely available 174 \nmeteorological data.  These assumptions are however a compromise, attempting to simplify 175 \nthe estimation of storm runoff while retaining the frequency signature of storms (daily) and 176 \nsoil moisture (monthly).   177 \n 178 \nThis approach can be applied using either a historic (or simulated historic) sequence of daily 179 \nrainfalls, or by summing over a frequency distribution of daily rainfall events for each 180 \nmonth.  The former approach is preferable for comparison with observed data, whereas the 181 \nlatter is more suitable for estimating long term average rates, but has the disadvantage that it 182 \ndoes not respond to inter-annual differences or to the timing of consecutive storms within a 183 \nmonth.   These methods thus provide an explicit link to available climate data, providing an 184 \nimproved physical basis for comparisons across large regions, and with climate scenarios or 185 \nhistoric data. 186 \n 187 \nThere are a number of simple methods for estimating storm runoff from storm rainfall.  188 \nImplicitly these are all based on an understanding of the infiltration process, and an 189 \nunderstanding that erosive overland flow can generally be represented as an infiltration 190 \nexcess, or Hortonian, process.  The effect of subsurface flow, where and when it is 191 \nimportant, may then be used to modify potential rates of infiltration, with lower infiltration 192 \nunder wet conditions.  Similarly the role of vegetation and soil organic matter can modify the 193 \ninfiltration rates through changes in soil structure and\/or the development over time of 194 \nsurface or near-surface crusting.  Three models are coupled to provide the dynamics of these 195 \nresponses; first an at-a-point hydrological balance which partitions precipitation between 196 \nevapotranspiration, overland flow, subsurface flow and changes in soil moisture; second a 197 \nvegetation growth model which budgets living biomass and organic matter subject to the 198 \nPage 9\/39 \nconstraints of land use and cultivation choices; and third a soil model which estimates the 199 \nrequired hydrological parameters from moisture, vegetation and seasonal rainfall history. 200 \n 201 \nAt-a-point soil hydrology can be described through the Richards\u2019 equation, although with 202 \nreservations where both matrix and macropore flow are active.  Solutions may be 203 \napproximated through the use of infiltration equations, such as the Green-Ampt (1911) or 204 \nPhilip (1957) formulations.  However these approaches are not compatible with the use of 205 \ndaily time steps, within which the detail of storm profiles is lost, and it is impracticable to 206 \nprovide better estimates of runoff than those from the SCS curve number (Yuan et al, 2001) 207 \nor a simple bucket model.  Here the bucket model is prefered, which offers a simple 208 \nconceptual insight into the volume of infiltration before runoff occurs, that can be linked 209 \ndirectly to concepts of soil moisture storage, as it varies within and between sites.  In the 210 \nbucket model, runoff  r is given by: 211 \n  (1), 212 \nIn which R is total storm rainfall, R0 is the runoff threshold, or bucket storage capacity, and 213 \np is the proportion of subsequent rainfall that runs off.   214 \n 215 \nFigure 2 illustrates the typical large scatter in relationships between observed total rainfall 216 \nand runoff, and none of these models can provide a satisfactory fit to the spread of data for 217 \ndaily time steps, and the bucket model (equation 1) has been adopted in the PESERA model, 218 \nin which storms are treated as independent random events.  Figure 3 shows the application of 219 \nthe Green-Ampt equation, with assumed parameters, to a set of storm events taken from a 220 \ncontinuous record for a semi-arid area in SE Spain.  The results of this analysis have been 221 \nplotted as cumulative runoff against cumulative storm rainfall, showing a similar scatter to 222 \nthat seen in figure 2.  Equation (1) has been freely fitted to the data, and it can be seen that, 223 \nPage 10\/39 \nwithout a more detailed knowledge of storm profiles than can be derived from the daily 224 \nrecord, it is both impracticable to apply a more sophisticated model, and unwise to make 225 \nrunoff forecasts for any individual storm.   226 \n 227 \n 228 \nSoil Water 229 \nWater infiltrating into the soil is limited by the runoff threshold, which is conceptualised as 230 \nan available near-surface water store.  The upper limit for this store is constrained by soil 231 \nproperties, and currently estimated from mapped soil classes in the European Soils Data 232 \nBase (Gobin et al, 2004).  The store may be decreased where the soil is crusted, and\/or if 233 \nsubsurface flow brings saturated conditions close to the surface.  Additional considerations 234 \napply where the soil is frozen or snow covered.  Both sub-surface flow and the near-surface 235 \nwater store are available for evaporation and for evapotranspiration linked to plant growth. 236 \n 237 \nAfter allowing for interception, evapo-transpiration is partitioned between the vegetated and 238 \nunvegetated fractions of the surface according to the proportional vegetative crown cover.  239 \nInterception is calculated as a fraction of rainfall rather than a fixed capacity, and this 240 \nfraction increases with vegetation biomass (Llorens et al, 1997).    Each evapotranspiration 241 \ncomponent is associated with a rooting depth, according to the land cover type for the 242 \nvegetated area and normally set at 10mm for the bare soil.  For each component, potential 243 \nevaporation (PE), after subtraction of interception, is then reduced exponentially to an actual 244 \nrate (AE) of: 245 \n  (2) 246 \nWhere WUE = water use efficiency for stage of plant growth (or 1.0 for bare soil) 247 \n D is saturated subsurface deficit 248 \nPage 11\/39 \nand hR is the rooting depth for each partiton.  249 \nContributions to evaporation are weighted for the fractional plant cover to give a combined 250 \nestimate. 251 \n 252 \nSubsurface flow is estimated using TopModel (Beven and Kirkby, 1979), with topographic 253 \nproperties estimated from local relief (from DEM) and soil parameters (saturated hydraulic 254 \nconductivity and TopModel soil parameter, m) from the soil type.  The average saturated 255 \ndeficit is estimated in monthly steps, to provide the background hydrological conditions and, 256 \nin particular, the saturation constraint on the runoff threshold which controls overland flow 257 \nrunoff in each storm.  Deficit is updated monthly from the TopModel expression: 258 \n (3) 259 \nwhere  D is the deficit after time t (as in equation 2) 260 \n D0 is the initial deficit, 261 \n i is the net rainfall intensity 262 \n m is the TopModel soil parameter 263 \nand j* is the average saturated runoff rate. 264 \n 265 \nThis expression also estimates the net subsurface runoff over the month as 266 \n  (4) 267 \nIn these calculations the total net rainfall is used, corrected for the overland flow runoff 268 \nwhere this is a significant fraction. 269 \n 270 \nPage 12\/39 \nThis combination of an infiltration excess mechanism, represented by the bucket model, with 271 \na saturation excess mechanism, represented by TopModel, provides a robust hydrological 272 \nsub-model which provides an adequate response across the humid to semi-arid continuum.  273 \nAs will be seen below, the evapo-transpiration stream is also used to drive a simple plant 274 \ngrowth model which is also responsive to this range of conditions. 275 \n 276 \nCold Climate modifications 277 \nWhere temperatures fall below freezing, the hydrological model needs to respond to snow 278 \nand frozen soil conditions.  For the monthly model, the range of temperatures is used to 279 \nestimate the proportional time below freezing, and the day-degrees above and below 280 \nfreezing.  Rainfall is assumed to fall as snow for the fraction of each month freezing, and 281 \nlying snow is accumulated and melted according to a linear degree-day model.  Next a depth 282 \nof soil freezing is calculated using a simple conductivity model, and assuming that the snow 283 \npack has a conductivity 20% that of the soil.  This is equivalent to an accumulated day-284 \ndegree model, with the calculated freezing depth proportional to the square root of the day-285 \ndegree sum.  The effective soil storage capacity is then allowed to fall exponentially with the 286 \nestimated freezing depth, increasing the estimated overland flow runoff.  However, practical 287 \nexperience suggests that both saturation excess overland flow and snowmelt runoff are less 288 \nflashy, and therefore less erosive than infiltration excess overland flow, so that the 289 \ncorresponding erosion estimates are reduced heuristically. 290 \n 291 \n  292 \nSoil properties 293 \nThe runoff threshold for infiltration excess overland flow is estimated as an area-294 \nweighted average of  the thresholds under vegetation and in the bare gaps between.  295 \nPage 13\/39 \nUnder vegetation, rainfall is lost to interception, and the runoff threshold is calculated 296 \nas the lesser of two values:  297 \n(1) available near-surface water storage capacity (depending on soil textural 298 \nproperties), or  299 \n(2) the sub-surface saturation deficit (from the TopModel estimate described 300 \nabove) 301 \n 302 \nIn arable areas, surface roughness represents the full storage capacity of furrows 303 \nimmediately after ploughing, and this decays exponentially with time in the subsequent 304 \nperiod, eventually falling to a minimum value representing the textural roughness of 305 \nthe surface.  Naturally vegetated areas are also assumed to present this minimum 306 \nroughness.   307 \n 308 \nBare areas are also considered to be subject to crusting, with a tendency to crusting 309 \nreferred to mapped soil classes, largely interpreted in textural terms as a minimum 310 \nrunoff threshold for a fully crusted surface (Le Bissonnais et al, 2002).  For arable 311 \nareas, the runoff threshold for a bare area is re-calculated as beneath vegetation 312 \nimmediately after tillage, this decays exponentially towards the minimum for each soil 313 \ntype with accumulated monthly rainfalls. 314 \n 315 \nThis formulation provides a seasonal response in runoff thresholds, and therefore in 316 \ninfiltration excess overland flow.  For a conventionally ploughed annual crop, for 317 \nexample, thresholds are high on first planting, but fall very rapidly immediately 318 \nafterwards, particularly if there is rain, as crusting develops while the crop provides 319 \nlittle cover.  As the crop grows, the runoff threshold recovers, recovering to high 320 \nPage 14\/39 \nvalues as the crop matures.  After harvest these high values fall again, depending on 321 \nhow or whether the surface is protected.  Under natural vegetation there is much less 322 \nannual variation, with runoff thresholds responding to the seasonality of cover. 323 \n 324 \n 325 \nThe distribution of infiltration excess overland flow in storms 326 \nStorm rainfalls are considered as independent random events, defined by a frequency 327 \ndistribution for each month of the year.  The autocorrelation between successive events 328 \nis weakly represented by the seasonal variations in soil moisture, but there is some loss 329 \nof information by using this approach.  This represents a trade-off between simplicity 330 \nand accuracy, with the least impact on estimates for the semi-arid areas where soil 331 \nerosion is generally considered to be most severe, because soils normally dry out 332 \nbetween major events. 333 \n 334 \nAs noted above, daily rainfalls have been used as the basis for analysis because, while 335 \nrecognising the limitations of this approach, it allows the use of the widespread daily 336 \nprecipitation data.  On a month by month basis, daily rainfalls are analysed to give 337 \nmonthly total, mean rain per rain-day and the standard deviation of rainfalls on rain-338 \ndays.  These statistical moments allow fitting most observed data for daily rainfalls to 339 \nthe probability density function for a Gamma distribution as follows: 340 \n  (5) 341 \nPage 15\/39 \nFigure 4 shows an example of the cumulative frequency distribution for data from SE 342 \nSpain.  The gamma distribution has been found to provide a robust fit, giving a good 343 \nbalance between small and large events.  The CV is generally between zero and unity, 344 \nso that the probability density distributions peak at zero rainfall. 345 \n 346 \nInfiltration excess overland flow for a storm of rainfall R is then given by equation (1) 347 \nabove, and the total overland flow runoff for the month integrated numerically as: 348 \n   (6) 349 \nThis is used directly as a component of the water balance, but it will be seen below that 350 \na power of event runoff is used to estimate sediment transport.  For a power law of 2.0, 351 \nthe corresponding summation of (Runoff)2 then takes the form: 352 \n 353 \n  (7), 354 \nAnd similarly if other powers are used.  This then gives the correct strong weighting to 355 \nthe largest events in the accumulated total. 356 \n 357 \n 358 \nLand use and vegetation cover 359 \nThe hydrological components of the model, as described above, are strongly dependent 360 \non vegetation cover, which is understood to be a major control on both runoff and 361 \nerosion.   Figure 5 illustrates the effect of changed land cover in a loess area with 1500-362 \n2000 mm annual precipitation.  It can be seen that runoff on bare soil exceeds 80%, 363 \nand falls to 2% under a dense vegetation cover, and that this 40-fold difference in 364 \nrunoff gives a 2000-fold difference in sediment loss.  Other experiments (e.g. Hudson 365 \nPage 16\/39 \nand Jackson, 1959) have shown that fine netting stretched above the surface  of an 366 \nagricultural field has almost as strong an effect as dense vegetation in reducing runoff 367 \nand erosion.  Thus the importance of crown cover for both runoff and erosion is 368 \nextremely strong, although it is recognised that root and soil organic matter effects are 369 \nalso important for uncultivated areas. 370 \n 371 \nLand cover has been approached in the model through two alternative strategies, each 372 \nof which has its advantages; first through direct remote sensing of land cover and 373 \nsecond through modelling vegetation growth.  Geomatic data has the advantage that it 374 \nprovides a direct measure of real vegetation abundance, which is now available 375 \nmonthly for a period of over twenty years, through AVHRR and LANDSAT images.   376 \nThis integrates the effects of all impacts on the cover in an unambiguous historical 377 \nrecord.  It therefore includes the impacts of factors which may not all be fully 378 \nincorporated in a model.  However, the analysis is based on the best of three monthly 379 \nsatellite passes, and suffers from the persistence of cloud cover in Northern Europe and 380 \nother humid areas.  It also lacks any direct forecasting potential, and therefore has 381 \nlimited applicability for analyses of scenarios for land use and\/or climate change.   382 \n 383 \nVegetation growth models are well established, with both generic and crop-specific 384 \nmodels.  The models applied here have been based on a biomass carbon balance for 385 \nboth living vegetation and soil organic matter.   Such models may be insufficiently 386 \nparameterised to cover the full range of functional types, and are commonly limited by 387 \nabsence or inadequate representation of some processes. Fire and grazing are, for 388 \nexample, not directly represented in the models that have been used to date with 389 \nPESERA.  As a result, the vegetation cover is more a \u2018potential\u2019 than actual cover, with 390 \nPage 17\/39 \nonly indirect parameterisation of some relevant influences.    However, growth models 391 \nrespond directly to changes in land use or climate drivers, and so have greater scenario 392 \npotential. 393 \n 394 \nAnalysis of RS images can be based directly on NDVI,  but improved results have been 395 \nobtained using the satellite-derived surface temperature to correct for water content, 396 \nlinearly unmixing in a phase-space triangle between water, vegetation and soil.  This 397 \ngives a measure of vegetation abundance which can be empirically related to cover 398 \nand\/or above ground biomass, and from which some land use classes can be interpreted 399 \nfrom the seasonal cover cycle. (Haboudane et al, 2002). 400 \n 401 \nThe generic vegetation model estimates gross primary productivity (GPP) as 402 \nproportional to the plant actual transpiration.  This is offset by respiration, at a rate 403 \nincreasing exponentially with temperature and proportional to biomass.  Leaf fall 404 \nfraction is a decreasing function of biomass, to allow for a larger structural component 405 \nin large plants.  Where respiration is greater than gpp, a \u2018deciduous\u2019 response increases 406 \nan additional leaf fall at a rate that increases with temperature.  Finally vegetation 407 \nbiomass may lose a fraction to grazing or plant gathering activities. 408 \n 409 \nSoil organic matter is increased by leaf fall, except where crops are harvested, and 410 \ndecomposes as a single linear store at a rate that increases with temperature. 411 \nCover is calculated independently, with reference to an equilibrium cover defined as 412 \nthe ratio of plant transpiration to potential evapotranspiration rate.  Cover converges on 413 \nthis (changing) equilibrium value at a rate which is larger where biomass is small, and 414 \nis the variable which drives the seasonal partition of runoff threshold between 415 \nPage 18\/39 \nvegetated and bare areas.  This generic model has been calibrated against global 416 \ndistributions of biomass (Kirkby and Neale, 1987).  Crop models are variants of this 417 \ngeneric model, with additional controls through data on regional patterns of planting 418 \nand harvest dates, and with an evolution of water use efficiency through the life cycle 419 \nof the crop  (Gobin and Govers, 2003). 420 \n 421 \nAccumulation of runoff discharge downslope 422 \nRunoff generated locally may not reach the base of the slope to deliver sediment to a 423 \nchannel, and the runoff coefficient for infiltration excess overland flow has therefore 424 \ngenerally been observed to decrease with distance or area downslope. The two 425 \ndominant reasons for this reduction are thought to be (Kirkby et al, 2005) the 426 \npatchiness of local runoff generation and the short duration of bursts of intense rainfall 427 \nwithin storms.  Patchiness occurs at several scales: for uncultivated areas the 428 \nalternation of shrubs or tussocks of grass with bare areas provides contrasts at the scale 429 \nof a few metres; while the patchwork of fields with different land use and\/or tillage 430 \ndirections provides a coarser mosaic in cultivated areas.  If there is good connectivity 431 \nbetween areas of above average runoff, then there may be substantial runoff even in 432 \nstorms which do not reach the average runoff threshold.  More commonly, however, 433 \npatches of runoff re-infiltrate within more absorbent areas.  Close to a channel or other 434 \ncollector, some patches of enhanced runoff connect directly with the channel, but little 435 \nreaches the channel from farther away because of intervening re-infiltration 436 \n(Cammeraat, 2002).  The result is that discharge increases with distance downstream 437 \nonly over a distance scaled to the patch size, and then levels off to a near-constant 438 \nvalue.  In larger or more intense storms, where runoff is generated over an increasing 439 \nPage 19\/39 \nproportion of the area, the region of increasing discharge also increases with the size of 440 \nindividual connected patches. 441 \n 442 \nThe second important mechanism for limiting discharge accumulation is that storms, 443 \neven substantial storms, commonly consist of short (<30 minutes) periods of intense 444 \nrain (>10mm hr-1) with longer periods at low intensity (Kirkby et al, 2005).  During 445 \nthese intense bursts, runoff is generated, and begins to flow downslope at average 446 \nvelocities which are generally of the order of only 1-3 cm s-1.  When the intensity falls, 447 \nthis flowing water re-infiltrates, and only reaches the channel from a zone 18 - 55 m 448 \nwide (in 30 minutes).  As for spatial patchiness, this gives a band of increasing 449 \ndischarge and a band of constant discharge; and the width of the band again tends to be 450 \ngreater in larger storms.   451 \n 452 \nSummed over the distribution of storm sizes described above, these factors lead to a 453 \nless then linear increase of discharge with distance downslope, and this has generally 454 \nbeen represented as a logarithmic or power law (with exponent ~ 2\/3) relationship.  455 \nSimilar arguments can be applied to saturation excess overland flow to suggest power 456 \nlaw exponents >1, but this is not pursued here since the saturation overland flow is 457 \ngenerally less flashy and therefore less effective in erosion. 458 \n 459 \n 460 \nSediment transport and sediment yield 461 \nEstimates of sediment transport are based on infiltration excess overland flow 462 \ndischarge, which has been discussed above.  Most sediment transport equations are 463 \nbased on considerations of tractive stress or flow power, and commonly generalised 464 \nPage 20\/39 \ninto a power law in discharge and gradient, thus avoiding a more detailed analysis of 465 \nflow thread geometry. The commonest formulations (e.g. Musgrave 1947) assume that 466 \nthere is an ample sediment supply, and that sediment is everywhere transported by soil 467 \nerosion at its transporting capacity C, expressed in the form: 468 \n  (8) 469 \nwhere  k is the soil erodibility, 470 \n Q  is the overland flow discharge per unit flow width  471 \n \u039b is the local slope gradient, 472 \nand m, n are empirical exponents, generally in the ranges m = 1.5-3; n = 1-2 473 \nIn such expressions, discharge is generally associated with distance from the divide, 474 \npossibly with a change in the exponent m.  It has generally been found that the 475 \nperformance of erosion models is remarkably insensitive to the choice of exponents, 476 \nlargely because slope and distance tend to change together., and exponent values of m 477 \n= 2,  n = 1 have therefore been adopted, with computational advantages that are evident 478 \nbelow. 479 \n 480 \nEvaluation of appropriate exponents may be made at a range of time and space scales 481 \n(e.g. Kirkby et al, 2002).  The most direct approach is through soil erosion plots, but 482 \nthese are often not corrected for the frequency distribution of storms to provide 483 \nmeaningful long term averages.  A second approach is by looking at the critical areas 484 \nrequired to support an ephemeral gully formed in a particular storm.  This approach 485 \nrequires an analysis of the stability of small depressions, as a balance is reached 486 \nbetween infilling by diffusive processes, primarily rainsplash in relevant contexts and 487 \ntheir enlargement by soil erosion (rillwash) processes. A third approach is by back 488 \nanalysis of hillslope profile form, which is formed over a period in response to the full 489 \nPage 21\/39 \ndistribution of events.  The difficulty with this approach lies in uncertainty about 490 \nwhether the observed landscape form has developed under process conditions that are 491 \nstill current, or are inherited from conditions of different climate and\/or land cover. 492 \n 493 \nThe values that have been adopted here lie within the empirical range, and will be seen 494 \nto have additional advantages in creating a consistent coarse scale model.  Here it is 495 \nproposed to use: 496 \n  (9) 497 \nwhere  r is the local runoff in each event, from equation (1) above, 498 \nand x is the distance from the divide. 499 \n 500 \nSumming over the frequency distribution of events in any month, the mean total 501 \nsediment transport takes the form: 502 \n  (10) 503 \nIn which the final term may be taken from equation (7) above. 504 \n 505 \nAlternatives to this composite power law approach can simulate selective 506 \ntransportation of different grain sizes, for example by defining transport capacity as the 507 \nproduct of detachment rate and travel distance.  This approach has the advantage of 508 \nallowing a spectrum of responses, from a strictly transport limited approach for the 509 \ncoarser soil fractions, to a detachment or supply limited approach for the finest 510 \nmaterial.  Although this approach has merit, there is not sufficient data to properly 511 \nparameterise it for the proposed coarse scale model.  In practice this means that the soil 512 \nerodibility for fine soils must implicitly be reduced to allow for the limited rate of 513 \nsupply, whether through hydraulic erosion or through removal of previously detached 514 \nPage 22\/39 \nmaterial, and that, for rangeland, selective transportation creates an armour layer over 515 \ntime that reduces erosion rates.  516 \n 517 \nIn the PESERA model, sediment transport is interpreted as the mean sediment yield 518 \ndelivered to stream channels, and includes no allowance for downstream routing within 519 \nthe channel network.  Sediment Yield Y is the sediment transported to the slope base, 520 \naveraged over the slope length, that is: 521 \n  (11) 522 \nwhere the suffix B indicates evaluation at the slope base, 523 \nand  L = xB is the total slope length. 524 \n 525 \nThe term L\u039bB can be expressed, in terms of the total slope relief, , where  is 526 \nthe average slope gradient from crest to base, giving: 527 \n  (12) 528 \nWhere  is the ratio of slope base to average gradient, a number which is 529 \ngenerally less between 0.5 and 1.0 for typical convexo-concave slopes.  This correction 530 \nterm can be included where available, but generally defaults to a slight correction in 531 \nthe empirical value for erodibility, k. 532 \n 533 \nEquations (11) and (12)  are taken as the final form of the expression used in the 534 \nPESERA model.  It may be seen to include three terms: 535 \n1. Soil erodibility, which is derived from soil classification data, primarily  536 \ninterpreted as texture (Le Bissonnais et al, 2002). 537 \nPage 23\/39 \n2. Local relief, which is derived from DEM data as the standard deviation of 538 \nelevation around each point. 539 \n3. An estimate of accumulated (runoff)2, which is derived from a biophysical 540 \nmodel that combines the frequency of daily storm sizes with an assessment of 541 \nrunoff thresholds based on seasonal water deficit and vegetation growth. 542 \n 543 \nImplementation 544 \nCurrently, the PESERA model can be implemented in two modes. Firstly, to provide 545 \nan estimate of sediment yield at a point, this is carried out in Excel, supported by 546 \nVisual Basic Macros, and secondly to produce a distributed estimate of erosion risk, 547 \nthis is achieved in FORTRAN, operating on data extracted from ARC-GIS grids 548 \n(PESERA-GRID).  The same algorithm is applied to each cell in the grid. Although a 549 \nreduced information system (e.g Brazier et al, 2001) was considered, the number of 550 \npossible combinations was considered too great to provide significant computational 551 \nsavings without severely restricting the number of possible values for the 128 552 \nvariables. 553 \n 554 \nActual erosion is very strongly impacted by the incidence of particular large storms, 555 \nand the approach adopted makes no attempt to provide a forecast, but estimates the 556 \nlong term average erosion rate over a long series of years.  This is considered to be 557 \nappropriate for assessing the spatial distribution of erosion risk at a regional scale. 558 \n 559 \nOn executing the model in either of the two modes, the annual cycle of monthly values 560 \nare applied repeatedly until the outputs stabilise in an annual cycle.  This reduces the 561 \ndependence on initial conditions. The hydrological components are generally found to 562 \nPage 24\/39 \nstabilise rapidly, within 3-5 years, Figure 6.  Vegetation components stabilised more 563 \nslowly, with a response time increasing with the lifespan and biomass of the plants, but 564 \nthese elements generally stabilise sufficiently within 50 years, and much more quickly 565 \n(~10 years) for annual crops, Figure 7.  Outputs are then reported after stabilisation.  566 \n 567 \nWithin the point code model, soil erosion is estimated separately for each month and for 568 \neach segment of the slope profile. This facility offers the potential to explore the sensitivity 569 \nof slope form in sediment yield. PESERA_GRID operates on local relief, estimated  as the 570 \nstandard deviation of elevation within a defined radius. At the 1-km scale only the 571 \nimmediate cells are considered. At finer resolutions a radius is adopted which reflects the 572 \nhillslope scale.  The model has been used in preparing the Pan European estimates of soil 573 \nerosion risk under current climate and land-use conditions, Figure 8.   574 \n 575 \nThe PESERA-GRID model has been developed primarily in Fortran90 with Arc Micro 576 \nLanguage (AML) modules to extract data and convert back to GRID. The Fortran90 577 \nexecutables are compiled and distributed in PC format, requiring at least .   578 \n512 RAM and 60GB Hard Drive Space  for the European  1 km Grid. 579 \n 580 \nData Input and Output (PESERA_GRID103) 581 \nMonthly climate data contributes the majority of data layers required to execute that drive 582 \nthe PESERA model.  Other data layers are derived from a number of sources that primarily 583 \ndescribe: land-use , crops and planting dates; soil storage and erodibility and relief.   A set of 584 \n128 input data layers are required.  Where local data is available at higher resolution this 585 \nlocal data can be utilised at the users discretion. However, as data resolution is refined (< 586 \n100m grid resolution) assumptions applied in the development of the PESERA model may 587 \nPage 25\/39 \nnot hold, particularly with respect to assuming that all cells drain directly to the channel 588 \nnetwork, and  therefore do not accumulate from cell to cell.    The standard input and output 589 \nvariables for the PESERA model are listed in Tables 2 to 6.   590 \n 591 \nConclusion 592 \nThe PESERA model may be seen to have a secure theoretical base, although the accuracy of 593 \nforecasts is limited by the restriction, based on data availability, to daily rainfall data, and to 594 \na greatly simplified analysis of topography.  Within these constraints, the model responds 595 \nboth rationally and in accordance with established principles to variations in climate, land 596 \nuse and topography.  An important component of the confidence placed in the model lies in 597 \nthis internal validation, in which the model is an explicit up-scaling and simplification of 598 \nprinciples that have been widely accepted and validated at finer scales. 599 \n 600 \nIn the second part of this paper, the application of the model will be tested against the limited 601 \nerosion plot data available, which has been used to provide an overall calibration, 602 \nparticularly of the erodibility values and range.  We also discuss the use of the model to 603 \nprovide erosion scenarios, in response to climate and land use scenarios drawn from Global 604 \nClimate Models and literature on trends in land use. 605 \n 606 \nAcknowledgement 607 \nThe PESERA model was developed with funding from the EC project, Contract: QLK5-CT-608 \n1999_01323  (PESERA - Pan European Soil Erosion Assessment), coordinated by G. 609 \nGovers (Katholieke Universiteit Leuven). 610 \n 611 \nPage 26\/39 \nReferences cited 612 \nBennett, H.H., 1939.
