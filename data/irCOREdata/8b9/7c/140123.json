In addition, the study indicates the\nurgent need for more research into this important area.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe challenge of new product development (NPD) is not only about the development of\nsuperior products. Managers also need to ensure that teams learn from each and every\nproject and create new knowledge (Wheelwright and Clark, 1992). A post-project\nreview (PPR) \u201cis a formal review\u2026 which examines the lessons which may be learnt\nand used to the benefit of future projects\u201d (Lane, 2000). Such reviews can help capture\nthe knowledge generated during NPD. Practitioners and academics alike have stressed\nthe importance of PPRs but, surprisingly, our understanding of how they are typically\nconducted or how learning can occur is limited.\nThere is wide anecdotal and some empirical evidence that not many\norganizations conduct PPRs (Bowen et al, 1994; Saban et al, 2000). Another issue to\nnote is that the literature on organizational learning is very relevant but most\nresearchers working in the NPD context have failed to consider these insights (McKee,\n1992). This paper considers organizational learning issues and presents an investigation\nof PPRs in four companies, showing their potential to facilitate knowledge creation and\nlearning.\nLITERATURE REVIEW AND THEORETICAL BASIS\nThree bodies of literature are relevant to this study: project management; research and\ndevelopment (R&D) management; and organizational learning.\nProject Management Literature\nThe need to formally review projects that have been completed was recognized at the\nend of the 1 950s, parallel to the emergence of project management as a discipline\n(Weinberg and Freedman, 1984). By the 1970s, recommendations had started to appear\non how to conduct PPRs (Gulliver, 1987). However, it is interesting to note that the\nwell-known \u201cProject Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK)\u201d (Project\nManagement Institute, 1996) did not mention PPRs (Williams et al, 2001), until\n\u201clessons learned\u201d was added to the glossary of a recent edition (Project Management\nInstitute, 2000).\nThree main advantages of PPRs are identified by the literature. Firstly learning\nfrom previous projects can help prevent similar mistakes (Pitman 1991, Ayas, 1997).\nSecondly, disseminating lessons learned is of critical importance (Ayas, 1997) and the\nmethods most often mentioned include databases and rotation of\n2personnel (Balthazor 1994, Holtshouse, 1999). Thirdly, every project needs to\ncontribute to an organization\u2019s continuous improvement (Ayas 1997; Prahalad and\nHamel, 1990).\nSource Empirical Basis Details \/ Critique of Methodology Recommendations for PPRs\nBaird et al\n(1999)\nAnecdotal\nexamples from\nUSA army projects\n\u2022 No details given, only discusses\nhow the guidelines could be used\nby companies\n\u2022 Make the discussions objective\n\u2022 \u201cBalance inquiry and advocacy\u201d\n\u2022 Use inference to understand the issues\nBusby\n(1999)\n4 PPRs in three\ndifferent companies \u2022 PPRs were observed and semi-\nstructured interviews conducted\nwith participants afterwards\n\u2022 It is unclear whether the study\nwas systematically conducted\n\u2022 No clear link between the\nfindings and the\nrecommendations\n\u2022 Consider the whole project history\n\u2022 Make a detailed diagnosis and \u201cplan\nremedies properly\u201d\n\u2022 Consider \u201cthe bigger system\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cDiscourage glib categorisation\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cInvite key outsiders\u201d\nRight Track\nAssociates\n(2002)\nPractical consulting\nexperience\n\u2022 No details given\n\u2022 Analyze which procedures worked well\nand which did not\n\u2022 Analyze which technical decisions were\neffective and which were not\n\u2022 Ask: \u201cwas this project a good idea?\u201d\n\u2022 Ask: \u201cwere sufficient skills and resources\navailable?\u201d and \u201cwere resources utilised to\nthe fullest extent possible?\u201d\n\u2022 Did the project achieve its goals\u2026 \u201cin\nterms of process and outcome?\u201d\nSchindler\nand\nGassman\n(2000);\nSchindler\nand Eppler\n(2003)\nAction research in\nnine multinational\ncompanies\n\u2022 Semi-structured expert interviews\n\u2022 Half-day follow-up workshops\n\u2022 Gives almost no details of the\nmethodology\n\u2022 Apparently no use of the\nrecognized approaches to action\nresearch\n\u2022 Capture the most important experiences\ndirectly after each project milestone\n\u2022 \u201cHave an external neutral moderator\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cPerform the lessons learned gathering\ngraphically\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cEnsure a collective, interactive\nevaluation\u201d\n\u2022 Get commitment to apply the insights\ngained\n\u2022 Instigate a \u201cproject knowledge broker\u201d\nTable 1: Guidelines for Conducting PPRs in the Project Management Literature\nThe literature also includes recommendations for conducting PPRs and Table 1\ngives an overview of these. Some of these are quite vague (e.g. \u201cdiscourage glib\ncategorization\u201d; Busby, 1999), whereas others are specific. For example, Schindler\nrecommended a \u201cproject knowledge broker\u201d, responsible for transferring the lessons\nlearnt within and between project teams (Schindler and Gassmann 2000; Schindler and\nEppler, 2003). A key problem is that the studies have not been conducted systematically\nand so the validity of the recommendations is questionable.\nR&D Literature\nKnowledge is the main source of long-term competitive advantage in R&D (Corso et al,\n2001). Therefore, the emphasis on learning from new product development projects is\nmade by several authors (e.g. Bowen et al, 1994; Leonard-Barton, 1992; Liyanage et al,\n1999). PPRs are widely recognized as an important but seldom used mechanism for\nlearning (Wheelwright and Clark, 1992; Bowen et al, 1994; von Krogh, 1998;\nBourgault and Sicotte, 1998; Cooper, 1999).\nThree empirical articles have established that the use of PPRs in R&D\norganizations is limited. One showed that only two out of 33 microelectronic\nmanufacturers use PPRs and mostly only for \u201cradical\u201d development projects (Boag and\nRinholm 1989). Goffin and Pfeiffer (1999) found that four of their 16 case study\n3companies used PPRs but failed to give details on how they were used. A survey of 63\nR&D managers identified that only 3% of their organizations conduct a PPR after every\nproject but the majority of them (94%) think their organizations should conduct PPRs\n(von Zedtwitz, 2002).\nEven though their importance has been recognized, our understanding of PPRs\nhas a weak empirical base, as is demonstrated by Table 2. It can be seen that the four\nmain papers are either based on small samples, or the personal experience of the author.\nThe recommendations have not been derived directly from the data and so it is unclear\nhow applicable they are. Moreover, the recommendations focus on knowledge that can\nbe written down, documented and easily shared. There is no advice on how the PPRs\ncan be used to share experiences which are more difficult to articulate or document.\nAdditionally, the papers are not based on learning theory: \u201cacademic research on\ninnovation has a strong learning orientation. The problem is that much of the work that\nhas been done is not organized in terms of underlying learning theory\u201d (McKee, 1992).\nConsequently, there is a need to introduce an organizational learning perspective.\nReference Empirical basis Details \/ Critique of\nMethodology\nRecommendations for PPRs\nDuarte and\nSnyder (1997)\nSingle case study -\nWhirlpool\n\u2022 Action research\nusing\nproduct development\nlearning template\n\u2022 Claims to be\npartially\nbased on Huber\u2019s\norganizational\nlearning model \u2013 but it\nis unclear how\n\u2022 Document what went well and what needs\nimprovement \u2013 at every stage in the process\n\u2022 Discuss openly what happened and why\n\u2022 Focus on the assumptions and the process used by\nthe team\n\u2022 Obtain as many different perspectives as possible\n\u2022 Be open to multiple interpretations and a systems\nperspective\n\u2022 Suggest a range of options for improvement\nLilly and\nPorter (2003)\nTwo stage research\nin various\norganizations\n\u2022 Exploratory\ninterviews with 16\nNPD managers in\neight companies\n\u2022 Mail survey across 49\ncompanies\n\u2022 Focus of research is\nexplicit knowledge\n\u2022 \u201cIncorporate reviews as a standard part of the\ndevelopment process\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cFormalized review procedures lead to fewer\nindividual learning biases\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cHaving multiple perspectives in the review\nprocess is very important\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cConducting only a single review minimizes the\nability to effectively learn from the project\nexperiences\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cLearning that does occur is often not fully shared\u201d\nSmith (1996) Anecdotal\nexamples from nine\ncompanies\n\u2022 No details given\n\u2022 Apparently no\nsystematic approach\n\u2022 Review every project\n\u2022 Assign a reviewer\n\u2022 Define a review process\n\u2022 Identify strengths\n\u2022 Constructively balance positive and negative\nfindings\n\u2022 Focus on process improvements\n\u2022 Interview key participants and back up the\ninterview with the data\n\u2022 Use metrics\nWheelwright\nand Clark\n(1992)\nVarious case\nstudies\n\u2022 Few details given of\nthe selection of cases,\nor how they were\nstudied\nSample question regarding:\n\u2022 Project background\n\u2022 Pre-project activities\n\u2022 Project team\n\u2022 Project management\n\u2022 Senior management review and control\n\u2022 Protoype and tests\nTable 2: Guidelines for Conducting PPRs in the R&D Management Literature\n4Organizational Learning\nThis literature focuses on the concept of \u201cknowledge\u201d, which was largely introduced by\nNonaka (1994), who indicated that there are two types of knowledge: \u201cexplicit\u201d and\n\u201ctacit\u201d. Explicit knowledge is easy to explain and document, whereas tacit knowledge\nis difficult to articulate. Although it is possible to distinguish theoretically between\nthem, they are hard to differentiate in practice (Lam 2000; Brown and Duguid, 1991).\nNonaka concluded that knowledge always has a tacit component that is largely shared\nthrough social processes. \u201cIn project work\u2026 a great deal of the know-how required is\ntied to knowledge that is not written in documents but realised through the expertise\nand understanding of the project personnel\u201d (Koskinen et al, 2003).\nNonaka (1994) identified various mechanisms for the generation and transfer of\nknowledge, including the central role of metaphors and stories in discussions. Groups\nof people who are informally bound to one another by exposure to a common class of\nproblems (\u201ccommunities of practice\u201d) are able to exchange knowledge with little verbal\nor written communication (Wenger and Snyder, 2000). Therefore knowledge \u2013\nespecially tacit knowledge - is often created and shared within a group setting (Sapsed\net al, 2000).\nAlthough social interactions, metaphors and stories are key exchange\nmechanisms, the literature (e.g. Nonaka) gives only anecdotal examples and no\nguidance on how to operationalize these concepts.\nConclusions on the Literature\nThe literature on PPRs in a NPD (i.e. R&D) context is currently limited to statements\non their importance, some indication that not many organizations use them, and\nuntested guidelines. Very few researchers have considered the organizational learning\nliterature, which demonstrates the tacit and social sides of learning. Overall, there is a\nneed for empirical studies of both how PPRs are conducted and how they can promote\nlearning.\nRESEARCH DESIGN\nResearch Questions\nBased on the gaps in the literature, a number of research questions were developed,\ntwo of which are presented here:\n1) How do companies conduct post-project reviews?\n2) What is the potential for both explicit and tacit learning from PPRs?\nMethodology\nIn-depth case studies were selected as the most appropriate methodology for the\nexploratory research on PPRs for three reasons. Firstly, case studies are most often\nfound when researching complex social phenomena in real-life contexts (Yin, 1994).\nSecondly, the limited amount of previous research on PPRs means that themes and\npatterns need to be identified (Eisenhard, 1989). Thirdly, case studies allow us to look at\nformal as well as informal processes within an organization and enable the researcher to\nlook at a wide array of variables (Hartley, 1994).\nSample\nThe sampling frame was large companies in the south of Germany, which is considered\nto be a leading high-tech region because it accounts for the highest number of patents\nand R&D investments per capita (Staatsministerium Baden-\n5W\u00fcrttemberg, 2001). The four companies chosen will, for reasons of confidentiality, be\ndesignated EngineeringCo, AppliancesCo, MedCareCo and MachineryCo.\nData Sources\nDue to complex nature of knowledge and learning, multiple sources of data were used\nand Figure 1 gives an overview. The documents obtained included guidelines for PPRs\nin companies\u2019 NPD process documentation and minutes of specific PPRs, which were\nall analyzed by content. Secondly, six interviews with NPD project managers and\nparticipants were conducted at each company, using both a structured and semi-\nstructured approach. A structured repertory grid interview was used as this technique is\nparticularly useful when interviewees find it difficult to articulate their views on\ncomplex topics (Goffin, 2002). This method identified key \u201clessons learned\u201d from\ncompleted projects. The rest of each interview was used for a semi-structured\nquestionnaire on how PPRs are run (e.g. the timing, location and focus of discussions\netc). Finally, one PPR was observed at each company and analyzed using a framework\nbased on organizational learning concepts. Meeting transcripts were checked with a\nparticular focus on stories and metaphors, as evidence for tacit knowledge creation and\ntransfer. Overall, the multiple sources of data allowed a high degree of triangulation as\neach aspect of PPRs could be studied from different perspectives.\nData\nSources\nData\nCollection\nFigure 1: Overview of data sources within each case study\nCROSS CASE ANALYSIS\nCurrent PPR practices\nThe analysis of PPR practices was based on the company documents, the interviews and\nthe observations of PPRs and conducted by the two authors in unison.

However, in practice PPRs take place later because of difficulties to set a\ndate for all participants \u2013 this was established by data from the minutes of PPRs and the\ninterviews being contrasted with the company NPD process documentation. The core\nteam is normally gathered in an internal meeting room but the use of an \u2018off-site\u2019\napproach appears to be positive in setting an appropriate atmosphere for team learning:\n\u201c\u2026for me personally the PPR is a gathering of experiences. By participating in a\nproject and in a PPR you learn automatically and are supported by others\u201d\n(Interviewee 3 EngineeringCo). Concluding the PPR with a team celebratory meal (e.g.\nMachineryCo) also appears to reinforce team learning. Although three companies\nassign the project manager to moderate, using an experienced moderator from outside\nthe team appears likely to be more effective \u201cA good moderator can cope better with\npeople who for example go on about the same thing for ages. The ones we have are\nreally good, know what they are talking about and how to stimulate the discussion\u201d\n(Interviewee 4 Appliances Co). The time invested in a PPR needs to be sufficient to\nachieve knowledge generation through detailed discussions. The exact time required\ndepends on the complexity of the project in question. The interest and support of senior\nmanagement has a big influence on the time and effort invested in PPRs. This is evident\nat ApplicancesCo, where the Chief Technology Officer introduced the PPR process,\nand a full day is invested using an internal trainer as a moderator. The results are then\npresented to senior management.\nAcross all four cases it is interesting to see that the discussion is mainly focused\non project problems: \u201c\u2026of course there are always some issues that everyone is\nsurprised about how they develop into big problems during the PPR discussion without\nanyone realizing their importance before\u201d (Interviewee 2 MedcareCo). The focus on\nproblems implies that mainly lessons on how to avoid problems will be disseminated\nrather than successful practices. At three of the companies the moderator guided\ndiscussions in a way that appear to support knowledge generation and discussions.\nExamples included discussions based on root cause analysis (e.g. EngineeringCo) and\ndrawing \u2018personal satisfaction curves\u2019 (AppliancesCo). Project team discussions are\nperceived as enlightening: \u201c\u2026yes, I am always surprised what you learn during a\nmeeting like that\u2026there are always new aspects of which I was not really aware of\nbefore\u201d (Interviewee 6 AppliancesCo).\nAll case companies produce a formal report from the PPR but the dissemination\nappears to be weak with little follow-up on action points. This means that much of the\nlearning is not transferred effectively to other projects. It was often mentioned that the\nPPR itself is the most important dissemination tool and less focus should be put on\nwritten documentation: \u201chow can I write this down, I know we understand it in the\nteam without any discussion, but for outsiders this might not be clear at all\u2026\u201d\n(Observation of the PPR at EngineeringCo)\nThe right-hand column of Table 3 gives recommendations based directly on the\nresearch. These include the timing, the use of an external moderator, stimulating\neffective discussions, the follow up of action points and the transfer of findings to\nfuture projects. These should enable R&D managers to improve NPD project-toproject\nlearning.\nThe Potential for Knowledge Creation\n9Our results strongly indicate the potential for learning from PPRs and we will give two\ncategories of examples: quotes from the interviews and an analysis of metaphors used in\nthe PPRs observed.\nInterviewees often discussed how much they learnt in PPRs that was not\ndocumented in the minutes (this was confirmed by triangulation with these documents).\nFor example, \u201cI learnt that you do not always have to fill huge files after a PPR. If you\nhave a good team and reflect collectively on each topic, it works just by the common\nunderstanding of these people.\u201d (Interviewee 5 MedcareCo). The tacit nature of much\nof this learning is typified by the following quote: \u201cI think lessons learned I can only\ndisseminate if I register it myself and then use it again in the projects I work in and like\nthat pass the experience on to my colleagues\u201d (Interviewee 3 MachineryCo).\nThe second indication of the tacit nature of knowledge generated and exchanged\nin PPRs is the usage of metaphors. Table 4 shows that in the 15 hours of PPRs\nobserved, a total of 55 metaphors were used. This means that metaphors and stories\nemerged on average nearly every 15 minutes of discussion. One example stems from\nthe PPR at Engineering Co, where a participant said, \u201cwe are always at the very end of\nthe food chain unfortunately\u201d meaning that he was responsible for the final assembly of\nproducts and therefore vulnerable to suffering from all of the problems that were\nexperienced during earlier project phases. Various metaphors were heard at\nAppliancesCo, including \u201cReichsbedenkentr\u00e4ger\u201d (German metaphor for someone who\nhas strong doubts about everything \u2018Minister of Doubt\u2019) - referring to someone who\nconstantly challenged the team\u2019s plans. This is the first time that empirical data on the\nlevel of usage of metaphors in PPRs has been collected and so there is no benchmark as\nto whether the case companies use metaphors more than other NPD teams. Our analysis\nshows that PPR participants use metaphors in various ways: to stimulate discussion\n(observed 12 times), in the middle of a topic, towards the end, or as an aside. Often\nmetaphors lightened the atmosphere or allowed sensitive points to be discussed in a\nnon-threatening way.\nCase Length of\nobserved\nPPR\nNumber of\nmetaphors\nidentified\nPlace of metaphors and stories in the discussion\nS t a r t M i d E n d A l o n e\nEngineeringCo 2,5 hours 14 3 5 6\nAppliancesCo 7,5 hours 30 6 6 13 5\nMedCareCo 3 hours 5 1 1 2 1\nMachineryCo 2 hours 6 2 3 1\nTotal 15 hours 55 12 10 20 13\nTable 4: Metaphors and Stories used during PPR discussions\nOverall, statements from interviewees about what and how they learned in PPRs\nand the use of metaphors and stories can be taken as tentative evidence for the creation\nand transfer of tacit knowledge.\n10\nDISCUSSION\nInvestigating how four companies conduct PPRs using multiple data sources provides a\ndepth of understanding that was previously missing. This allows clearer\nrecommendations to be made about how PPRs should be organized and how\ndiscussions can be stimulated. The minutes of PPRs show a focus on explicit\nknowledge, such as project management issues (e.g. schedule, cost and quality) and the\ntechnical lessons learned (e.g. problems solved). However, interviews with NPD\nengineers and managers indicate that far more can be learnt from projects, such as\nbetter ways to communicate. PPRs have the potential to stimulate learning. However,\nacross all four companies the learning from PPRs is currently only disseminated\neffectively to the people who participate in the meeting. Although documentation is\nproduced, this is not an effective mechanism and action points do not seem to be\nfollowed up efficiently.\nBased on the research, the main recommendations for practitioners are (see\nalso Table 3):\n\uf0b7 Six months after product introduction sufficient time needs to be allocated to a\ndetailed of both the success and problems encountered on the project. A moderator\nfrom outside the team and a suitable location are important to set the right\natmosphere for knowledge generation;\n\uf0b7 The moderator needs to take steps to try and stimulate the exchange of tacit\nknowledge and focusing on metaphors and stories may help;\n\uf0b7 Management needs to design suitable mechanisms for the dissemination of the\nresults of PPRs across their whole organization; otherwise much of the effort will\nbe wasted. Effective dissemination consists of more than minutes and reports from\nPPRs. Encouraging social interactions between different project teams may help\nand using stories to summarize the key learning could well be more effective than\njust formal reports;\n\uf0b7 NPD team members view PPRs positively and they can be an ideal opportunity to\ncelebrate success.\nFor NPD researchers there are some important implications:\n\uf0b7 Project-to-project learning has been given too little attention in the past;\n\uf0b7 There is a need to understand what the frequency of usage of PPRs is and how they\nare typically conducted;\n\uf0b7 The exact nature of the lessons learned in PPRs must be investigated (and here we\nhave the opportunity to analyze other aspects of our data);\n\uf0b7 Our understanding of how knowledge is generated in NPD is only just emerging.\nHowever, NPD researchers could and should take a lead in investigating how tacit\nknowledge is generated and how it can be observed (i.e operationalized).\nOverall, the research confirms the learning potential of PPR\u2019s and, as one interviewee\nstated: \u201conly in such a group with people from diferent functions\u2026[can] you always\nlearn something you did not know before\u201d (Interviewee 3 AppliancesCo).\n11\nREFERENCES\n1.
