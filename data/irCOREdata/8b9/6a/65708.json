It is likely that\ninsults to the gut (e.g. Giardia) and challenges to the immune system (weaning) have a different\nimpact in early and late infancy.\nBreast-feeding: Lactose digestion: Growth: Malnutrition: Malabsorption: Diarrhoea\nPoor growth status is an indicator of inappropriate living\nconditions and a poor environment (Tanner, 1986;\nPanter-Brick, 1998). In Nepal, children have been reported\nto have a high prevalence of growth retardation, in both\nrural areas (Costello, 1989; Panter-Brick, 1997) and\namong the urban poor (Panter-Brick et al. 1996; Moffat,\n1998). Assessment of growth status among 6\u201336-month-\nold Nepali children has shown that 49 % are underweight\nand 64 % are stunted (Nepal Nations Multiple Indicator\nSurveillance, 1995; cited in UNICEF, 1996). In infancy,\ngrowth faltering is evident from 6 months (Costello,\n1989; Moffat, 1998).\nMost studies relate growth faltering to either food intake\nor infection. Lunn (2000), however, suggested that food\nmalabsorption is a significant cause of malnutrition, result-\ning from abnormal function of the small intestinal mucosa.\nHe outlined two possible mechanisms leading to under-\nnutrition. First, following infection by dietary pathogens,\npossibly from unhygienic food preparation or storage, the\nvilli in small intestinal mucosa are damaged and lose the\nvulnerable disaccharide lactase, leading to maldigestion\nof lactose and probably other nutrients. Second, the barrier\nfunction in the small intestinal mucosa is compromised by\npathogens, allowing translocation of macromolecules,\nresulting in mucosal inflammatory and immune reactions,\nassociated with impaired growth of children. Mucosal\nfunction can be assessed using the dual-sugar intestinal\npermeability test, which is used in clinical investigation\n* Corresponding author: Dr Catherine Panter-Brick, fax +44 191 374 7527, email Catherine.Panter-Brick@durham.ac.uk\nAbbreviations: HAZ, height-for-age z-score; L:M, lactulose:mannitol; WAZ, weight-for-age z-score.\nBritish Journal of Nutrition (2002), 88, 141\u2013149 DOI: 10.1079\/BJN2002599\nq The Authors 2002\nof small bowel diseases (Lunn et al. 1991), but is also valu-\nable as a non-invasive test of gut function at community\nlevel.\nThe relationship between poor intestinal permeability\nand child growth was previously demonstrated in Gambian\ninfants, where growth faltering was reported at about 3\u20134\nmonths of age, following the introduction of supplementary\nfoods (Lunn et al. 1991). In addition, mucosal damage may\nseverely affect lactase activity (Northrop-Clewes et al.\n1997). Lactose is the major carbohydrate in breast-milk,\nand thus expected to contribute to infant linear growth.\nMetabolism of lactose is dependent on the presence of\nthe enzyme lactase, and lactase in the small intestine is\nparticularly vulnerable to villi damage. The association\nbetween growth and gut damage is potentially of great\nimportance when determining the mechanisms underlying\nchild malnutrition and ill-health in less developed\ncountries. It is therefore important to test whether such\nassociations hold in other populations where unsanitary\nconditions and growth stunting are extremely common\nproblems.\nThe timing of weaning, beginning with the introduction\nof supplementary foods, is a particularly important point in\nthe child\u2019s development as diarrhoeal pathogens (e.g. E.\ncoli, rotavirus, dysentery bacillus) in contaminated food,\nand soil\u2013water-transmitted parasites are introduced and\nmay damage the small intestinal mucosa. Indeed, in\nGuatemala, Goto et al. (1999) found that early weaning\n(as cessation of breast-feeding) worsened intestinal per-\nmeability values for infants 0\u201311 months of age. In\ncountries such as Nepal, children are usually breast-fed\nfor periods of 2\u20133 years (Panter-Brick, 1992; Moffat,\n2001); no studies have yet investigated the impact of late\ncessation of breast-feeding on gut function. However,\nweaning is really two different events: the introduction of\nsupplementary foods and the cessation of breast-feeding\n(Almedom, 1991). We hypothesise that these two events\n(weaning stages 1 and 2; Fig. 1) will have a different\nimpact on child health.\nThe present cross-sectional study examined the relation-\nship between intestinal permeability, growth status, wean-\ning practices, parasite infection and reported morbidity in\nchildren 0\u201360-months-old. It focused on children in poor\nurban squatter areas in Nepal, who live in poor sanitation\nand socio-economic conditions.\nMethods\nSamples\nFieldwork was conducted from September 1999 to April\n2000 in two urban areas in Kathmandu, the capital of\nNepal. Both sites are squatter settlements (illegally occu-\npied), located near polluted rivers. The people use the\nriver for domestic activities such as washing and travelling\n(there is pumped water for drinking). One site is more\neasily flooded by the river, being situated lower down the\nriver bank. A house-to-house demographic survey was\nundertaken, reaching 95 % of all households: a total of\n315 households and 1411 people were surveyed in the\ntwo communities.\nAnthropometric measurements were undertaken on all\nchildren aged 0\u201360 months in the community (n 210,\nninety-eight boys and 112 girls). Parasitic infections were\ntested for in 173 children and 172 morbidity reports were\ncompleted (the other thirty-seven children either moved\nout of the community or did not give a faecal sample).\nUrine samples were obtained for testing intestinal per-\nmeability from 167 children. In terms of ethnic and caste\ncomposition, over half the children were of Tibeto\u2013\nBurmese origin, 24 % were Indo\u2013Aryan high caste and\n16 % were Indo\u2013Aryan low caste.\nMeasures\nWeight (with minimum clothing) and height or length (for\nchildren over or under 24 months respectively) were\nmeasured following standard techniques (Lohman et al.\n1988), using portable equipment (stadiometer 0\u00b71 cm pre-\ncision; length board 0\u00b75 cm precision; electronic scales\n0\u00b71 kg precision; electric baby scale, 0\u00b701 kg precision).\nFor the intestinal permeability test, children were given\n400 mg lactulose and 100 mg mannitol dissolved in 2 ml\nwater\/kg body weight, 2 h after breakfast (the children\nthen abstained for 1 h from eating foods, but not from\nbreast-feeding). Five hours later, urine was collected in\nurine bags (U-bag Urine Specimen Collector Pediatric;\nHollister Ltd, Wokingham, Berks., UK), and a few drops\nof a bacteriostat (chlorhexidine gluconate, 200 ml\/l water)\nwere added. Total urine volume was recorded and after\nmixing, two 1 ml samples were taken. The samples were\nfrozen at 2208C at the local hospital (Tribhuvan University\nFig. 1. Variables characterising weaning practices. BF, breast-feeding;\nA, duration of exclusive BF; B, duration of supplementation; C, time until stopped\nBF; D, time on solids only.\nR. Goto et al.142\nTeaching Hospital) in Kathmandu until shipment to the\nUK. The samples were analysed for mannitol, lactose\nand lactulose by enzymatic assay (Lunn et al. 1989;\nNorthrop et al. 1990; Blood et al. 1991; Lunn &\nNorthrop-Clewes, 1992) using a centrifugal spectropho-\ntometer (Cobas Fara, Roche, Switzerland) at the Northern\nIreland Centre for Diet and Health, University of Ulster.\nStool samples for the examination of parasite infection\nwere collected by the mothers or other caretakers, using\na standard procedure familiar to the Nepali: mothers\ninserted a stick at several places in the excreted faeces,\nand the faeces collected were put into a specimen case\nand sealed. Samples were brought daily to the Clinical\nMicrobiology Department in the Tribhuvan University\nTeaching Hospital, Kathmandu, and analysed for Ascaris\nlumbricoides, Trichuris trichuria, Giardia lamblia, hook-\nworm and tapeworm using standard microscopy\ntechniques.\nInterviews with the caretakers were conducted to ascer-\ntain birth date, weaning practices and child morbidity in\nthe previous day and the preceding 7 d. In urban Nepal,\nbirth dates are accurately known and given in years,\nmonths, and days, with reference to the Nepali calendar.\nQuestions on weaning practices focused on whether the\nchild was given breast-milk, solid food, or both, and the\ntiming of first supplementation of solid foods (pito, a\ngruel with lentil beans and rice, or bhat, a cooked rice)\nand of breast-feeding cessation. For morbidity, open-\nended questions were asked regarding whether or not the\nchild was ill yesterday or in the preceding 7 d (following\nKroeger, 1983; Ross & Vaughan, 1986). If the child was\nill, there were further questions regarding the nature of\nthe illness according to common descriptive terms: pakhala\n(diarrhoea), khoki (cough), ruga (cold or flu), jwaro\n(fever), tawko dukhey (headache), pet dukhye (stomach\npain), wakwaki (nausea), bomi (vomiting), juka (worm\ninfection) and dadura (measles) (see Gartoulla, 1998).\nKatz et al. (1998) found a good agreement between 7 d\nmaternal report and medical examinations of child morbid-\nity in rural Nepal.\nEthical clearance for the study was given by the\nUniversity of Durham Ethics Committee in the UK and\nby Tribhuvan University in Nepal.\nStatistical analyses\nGood reliability (R ) for weight and height or length\nmeasurements was confirmed from a data set of repeated\nmeasurements on the same children (as recommended by\nUlijaszek & Kerr, 1999). Growth status was characterised\nby two variables, height-for-age and weight-for-age z-\nscores. The z-scores (standard deviations from the\nmedian of the National Center for Health Statistics refer-\nence growth curve) were calculated using the computer\nsoftware EPI-NUT in EPI-INFO (version 6.03, 1996;\nCenter of Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA,\nUSA).\nIntestinal permeability was expressed as the ratio of the\nsugars lactulose:mannitol (L:M), in urine. Values for lactu-\nlose and mannitol excretion were accepted if they were\nwithin the range of expected recovery rates ((urine\nexcretion of sugar\/actual intake of sugar) \u00a3 100). The per-\ncentage recovery rate for lactulose was 0\u00b702\u201315\u00b700 and for\nmannitol 0\u00b75\u201315\u00b700. Only eleven values were excluded.\nVariables such as lactose (related to maldigestion) and\ncreatinine (a proxy for urinary function) were also exam-\nined. The urinary lactose:lactulose ratio, a method for esti-\nmating lactose maldigestion was validated by Noone et al.\n(1986) and greater than above 0\u00b74 was taken to indicate sig-\nnificant lactose maldigestion (Northrop-Clewes et al.\n1997).\nIntestinal permeability ratios and lactose values were\nconverted to natural logarithm to normalise the data distri-\nbution (after the Kolmolgorov\u2013Smirnoff statistic indicated\nsignificant skewness). The geometric mean (i.e. the anti-\nlog of mean log L:M ratio) was used for the purposes of\ncomparison with previous studies. As a measure of vari-\nance, a value termed the geometric standard error (defined\nas (antilog (mean \u0087 standard error of logged values) 2\ngeometric mean)) was also calculated. The published\nnorm for healthy UK children (Lunn et al. 1991), geo-\nmetric mean 0\u00b712 (corresponding to a log L:M ratio of\n22\u00b712), was taken to demarcate between poor and good\nintestinal permeability; a high L:M ratio indicates poorer\ngut function.\nWeaning practices were coded as four variables: (A)\nduration of exclusive breast-feeding; (B) duration of food\nsupplementation; (C) time until stopped breast-feeding;\nand (D) time on solids only (Fig. 1). Of particular interest\nis stage 1 (introduction of solid foods, indicated by vari-\nables A and B) and stage 2 (cessation of breast-feeding,\nvariables C and D) characterising the process of weaning.\nParasite infestation was recorded and coded as presence\nor absence of any parasite in stool samples. Morbidity data\nwere coded as children who were ill v. not, and children\nwho had diarrhoea v. those that did not, both in the pre-\nvious day and the preceding 7 d.\nStepwise multiple and logistic regression analyses were\nused to explore relationships between growth status, intes-\ntinal permeability, weaning variables, parasite infestation,\nmorbidity and children\u2019s characteristics such as age, sex,\nethnicity\/caste (Tibeto\u2013Burmese v. Indo\u2013Aryan high or\nlow caste), and squatter location (two sites). Post-hoc\ntests were used to evaluate differences between subgroups\nof children. Using the Statistical Package for the Social\nSciences (SPSS, version 10.0; Chicago, IL, USA),\nP,0\u00b705 was accepted as the level of significance.\nResults\nGrowth status\nChildren were mildly stunted (mean height-for-age z-score\n(HAZ) 21\u00b745, SD 1\u00b716) and underweight (mean weight-\nfor-age z-score (WAZ) 21\u00b762, SD 0\u00b783; Table 1). There\nwere a high proportion of children with z-scores ,22\n(37 and 33 % for HAZ and WAZ respectively). HAZ and\nWAZ values worsened with age, despite the age correction\nincorporated in the z-scores: 0\u201312-month-old children\naveraged 20\u00b750 and 20\u00b767 for HAZ and WAZ respect-\nively, while 12\u201324-month-old children averaged 21\u00b751\nIntestinal permeability in children 143\nfor both variables ( post-hoc test P,0\u00b70001), with mean\nvalues showing no improvement after age 2 years.\nAge alone made a strong impact on HAZ (R 2 16 %,\nP,0\u00b70001), while both age and ethnicity had an impact\non WAZ (R 2 14 %, P,0\u00b70001 and P\u00880\u00b7006 respectively).\nTibeto\u2013Burmese children achieved better growth status\nthan the low caste children of Indo\u2013Aryan origin ( post-\nhoc test, P\u00880\u00b7032 for WAZ), especially after 18 months\ngiven a strong age and ethnicity interaction (P\u00880\u00b7003).\nThere were no detectable sex differences.\nIntestinal permeability ratio and lactose\nMost children (92 %) had poorer L:M ratios relative to the\nUK norm of 0\u00b712 (Table 2). The geometric mean was simi-\nlar to that of Bengali children (L:M ratio of 0\u00b727 for Nepal\nand 0\u00b724 for Bangladesh, Table 2). The actual raw data for\nL:M ratio show a wide range of values (Fig. 2), all within\nthe range of acceptable recovery rates. Child age, sex,\nethnicity\/caste and location had no impact on L:M ratios.\nOne half of children (47 %) showed low lactase activity\n(lactose:lactulose ratios .0\u00b74). Lactose values and lactose:\nlactulose ratios decreased with age (R2 28 %, P,0\u00b70001);\nsex, ethnicity and location had no impact. Lactose and\nlactose:lactulose ratios showed no associations with L:M\nratio. Breast-fed children had significantly higher urinary\nlactose concentrations and lactose:lactulose ratios than\nnon-breast-fed counterparts (lactose 172\u00b75 and 44\u00b75 mg\/l;\nlactose:lactulose ratios 2\u00b776 and 0\u00b731 respectively)\n(P,0\u00b70001, corrected for infant age), but similar intestinal\npermeability values (0\u00b723 and 0\u00b728 respectively).\nParasite infection\nParasite infection was detected in 54 % of the 173 children\nwhose stools were examined. Ascaris lumbricoides (round-\nworm) was most common (59 %) followed by Trichuris tri-\nchiuria (whipworm) (37 %), Giardia lamblia (Giardia)\n(14 %), hookworm (9 %), and H. nana (tapeworm) (7 %).\nChild age and location were significant predictors of para-\nsite infection in a logistic regression (R 2 20 %, P,0\u00b70001\nand P\u00880\u00b7002 respectively): parasite infection was most\ncommon for older children and in the location most\neasily flooded by river water.\nChildren with Giardia showed significantly worse L:M\nTable 1.

Giardia infection per se also\naffected lactose (P\u00880\u00b7009) and lactose:lactulose ratios\n(P\u00880\u00b702). It had no detectable impact on anthropometric\nmeasurements.\nMorbidity\nOf 172 children for whom morbidity data were available,\nforty-three were reported ill (40 % with diarrhoea) the pre-\nvious day and seventy-one children were ill (32 % with\ndiarrhoea) in the preceding 7 d. Illness in the preceding\n7 d was negatively associated with child age (R 2 3 %,\nP\u00880\u00b7033), and diarrhoea in the preceding 7 d associated\nwith both age and ethnicity (R 2 7 %, P\u00880\u00b7010): thus\nyoung children were more likely to be ill and Tibeto\u2013\nBurmese children were more likely to have diarrhoea.\nIllness in the previous day had no detectable impact on\nintestinal permeability ratios, but was associated with\nhigher lactose values and also lactose:lactulose ratios (R 2\n31 % and 36 % respectively, P,0\u00b70001, controlling for\ninfant age). Specifically, having diarrhoea was associated\nwith higher lactose and lactose:lactulose values\n(P,0\u00b7001).\nWeaning practices\nOnly two out of 172 children were not breast-fed from\nbirth. Children started supplementary weaning foods at 6\nmonths (variable A, mean 5\u00b79 (SD 3\u00b79) months) and stopped\nbreast-feeding when 2-years-old (variable B, mean 23\u00b70 (SD\n11\u00b76) months). At the time of the study, the duration of\nsupplementation was 27 months (variable B, mean 26\u00b76\n(SD 16\u00b76) months), and the average time on solids was 19\nmonths (variable D, mean 19\u00b71 (SD 12\u00b74) months).\nFig. 2.

Stage 2 (the\ncessation of breast-feeding, variables C and D) was associ-\nated with age and location (in the location easily flooded\nby river water, children stopped breast-feeding later) (R 2\n41 %, P,0\u00b70001 and P\u00880\u00b7031 respectively for variable\nC; R 2 33 %, P,0\u00b70001 and P\u00880\u00b7018 respectively for vari-\nable D). Sex, caste and ethnicity of the child had no detect-\nable association with weaning practices.\nIntestinal permeability was associated with stage 2 of\nweaning, but not stage 1: variable C accounted for 10 %\nof the variance in L:M ratios (P\u00880\u00b7031; age, parasite\ninfection, location, morbidity and variable D made no\nadditional impact; Table 3). Fig. 4 illustrates the positive\nrelationship between variable C and intestinal per-\nmeability. Children with a longer period of breast-feeding\n(more than 2 years) showed higher L:M ratios (i.e. worse\ngut function) than children who had breast-fed for less\ntime. The period of time on solid only (variable D) made\nno independent contribution to the variance in L:M ratios.\nWith respect to lactose digestion, stage 1 of weaning\n(duration of supplementation, variable B) was negatively\nrelated to lactose values (P,0\u00b7001) and lactose:lactulose\nratios (P,0\u00b70001), but only in the breast-fed group of\nchildren.\nWith respect to growth (HAZ), in the group of breast-\nfeeding children, the only variable of importance was\nethnicity and its interaction with age (Table 4). Among\nnon-breast-feeding children, however, weaning stage 2\n(variable C) had a strong negative impact on HAZ\n(P\u00880\u00b7024); ethnicity had an impact on WAZ (P\u00880\u00b7035)\n(Table 4). A longer period of breast-feeding was associated\nwith poorer height-for-age; intestinal permeability ratio,\nlactose, parasite infection, location and reported morbidity\nhad no detectable impact on growth status.\nDiscussion\nThe children in the present study were mildly stunted and\nunderweight. Their growth status worsened rapidly, early\nin life (for 0\u20131-year-olds, mean HAZ 20\u00b750 and WAZ\n20\u00b767; for 1\u20132-year-olds, mean HAZ 21\u00b751 and WAZ\n21\u00b751; post-hoc tests P,0\u00b70001). Tibeto\u2013Burmese chil-\ndren fared better after 18 months of age, as reported in\nother studies (Martorell et al. 1994; Strickland & Tuffrey,\n1997).\nTable 3.

For\ndetails of subjects and procedures, see Table 1 and pp. 142\u2013143.\nR. Goto et al.146\nAs expected, the Nepali children showed poorer mucosal\nfunction than UK children (Table 2) (Lunn et al. 1991).\nThe geometric mean of 0\u00b726 for the Nepali children was\nvery similar to that obtained for Bengali children who\nhad been differentiated into subgroups of \u2018healthy\u2019 and\n\u2018ill with diarrhoea\u2019 individuals, with geometric mean\nvalues of 0\u00b723 and 0\u00b732 respectively (Rousham et al.\n1998). Several studies support a strong relationship\nbetween a current episode of diarrhoea and poor gut func-\ntion. In the Gambia, children who suffered from diarrhoea\nfor more than 14 d showed significantly poorer intestinal\npermeability than children with diarrhoea for less than\n14 d (geometric mean values 2\u00b785 and 1\u00b700 respectively,\nP,0\u00b7001; Behrens et al. 1987). In the present study, no\nsignificant differences were found in L:M ratio between\nchildren who had diarrhoea in the preceding 7 d and\nthose who were reported to be healthy (geometric mean\nvalues 0\u00b731 and 0\u00b731 respectively). Other studies have\nsimply excluded children affected with acute diarrhoea\nbecause of technical problems with urine collection (yet\nstill found that recent history of diarrhoea was associated\nwith altered gut function; Goto et al. 1999).\nIn the present study, neither reported morbidity nor hel-\nminth infestations were convincingly associated with\naltered intestinal permeability, or growth status. However,\nthe presence of Giardia was significantly associated with\npoorer gut function (P\u00880\u00b7014). There were only a few\nidentified cases of hookworm (n 8) and Giardia (n 8),\nwhich are the parasites that cause the greatest damage to\nthe intestinal wall (Solomons, 1982; Farthing, 1984).\nIndeed, one recent study in Bangladesh reported a signifi-\ncant increase in the prevalence of Giardia intestinalis in\na group of children treated with anthelmintics, which was\nassociated with higher intestinal permeability and a short-\nterm reduction in weight (Lunn et al. 1998; Northrop-\nClewes et al. 2001).\nThe timing of weaning also showed a significant impact\non intestinal permeability. Interestingly, such impact was\ndetected from the cessation of breast-feeding (stage 2)\nrather than from the introduction of supplementary foods\n(stage 1). To our knowledge, only one other study con-\nducted in Guatemala (Goto et al. 1999) has specifically\nexamined the associations between feeding practices and\nintestinal permeability. That study found that L:M ratios\ncorrelated with the age at termination of breast-feeding\n(P\u00880\u00b7036), but were unrelated to the period of non-\nbreast-feeding. The authors argued that: \u2018it was the early\ntermination of breast-feeding, rather than the amount of\ntime since weaning that was associated most closely with\naltered small intestinal mucosal function\u2019, implicating, as\nin our current study, variable C rather than variable D.\nHowever, Goto et al. (1999) reported a negative relation-\nship (i.e. the early termination of breast-feeding worsened\nintestinal permeability values), while we found a positive\none. The two studies, while both of poor peri-urban com-\nmunities, are not entirely comparable, given the age of\nchildren included in the investigations. The Guatemalan\nchildren were 0\u201311-months-old, and 28 % ceased breast-\nfeeding at 6\u201311 months of age; however, in Nepal,\nbreast-feeding was terminated on average at 23 months.\nIn sum, the Guatemalan children were weaned much earlier\nthan the Nepali children, and the timing of weaning events\nmay well differentially affect gut function. The Nepali\nsample included a large range of ages (0\u20135 years). This\nincludes both a precarious time of life with the introduction\nof weaning foods, at 3\u20136 months of age, and a more settled\nperiod after 12\u201315 months of age, when growth can be\nexpected to stabilise and gut permeability may not further\nworsen. It is possible that insults to the gut and challenges\nto the immune system have more of an impact on child\nhealth in the younger age group.\nThe present study found a clear association between gut\nfunction and weaning practices (the time until breast-feed-\ning stopped) in Nepali children. However, the relationship\nis opposite to what might have been expected: children\nwho were breast-fed for a longer period showed poorer\nintestinal permeability (P\u00880\u00b7031, Table 3). Such children\nalso showed significantly poorer growth status (P\u00880\u00b7024,\nTable 4). These associations are not confounded by\ninfant age or community location, and are not easy to\nexplain. Field experience in Nepal suggests that Nepali\nmothers extend the nursing period for children whom\nthey perceive are growing poorly. A cohort study in\nGuinea-Bissau, West Africa, similarly concluded that\nmothers who have malnourished children nurse for a\nlonger time than mothers with better nourished ones (chil-\ndren with low weight-for-age were breast-fed longer that\nthe better nourished children; Molbak et al. 1994). In\naddition, breast-feeding in older children may not have\nthe expected protective effects on mucosal function; in\nGuatemala, Goto et al. (1999) suggested that breast-\nfeeding prevents mucosal damage only in very young chil-\ndren, when the gut is very immature. The results suggest a\ncomplex association between life stage, the timing of\nweaning (cessation of breast-feeding), and the integrity of\ngut function in children. Those relationships may have an\nimportant differential impact on children\u2019s growth.\nThe Nepali children also showed high lactose excretion\n(47 % of them had lactose:lactulose ratios symptomatic of\nlow lactase activity). Breast-fed children had significantly\nhigher lactose values (and lactose:lactulose ratios) than\nthose who were no longer breast-fed (P,0\u00b70001), but had\nsimilar intestinal permeability values. This probably reflects\nhigher lactose intakes in those children still breast-feeding,\nwhich fall after stage 2 of weaning. Lactose values were\nalso positively related to morbidity reported for the pre-\nvious day (P,0\u00b70001), and particularly to diarrhoea\n(P,0\u00b7001). Such observations probably reflect gut\ndamage and poorer lactose absorption concurrent with\ndiarrhoea.\nFinally, there was no direct association between gut func-\ntion and growth status per se. Such results do not support\nthe suggestion that gut damage is significantly associated\nwith growth retardation in poor developing countries\n(Lunn, 2000). However, these negative results could be\nattributed to several factors. First, the present study is\ncross-sectional rather than longitudinal, which is an import-\nant limitation. Second, the urban poor Nepali children were\nonly mildly stunted, with just 37 % of children actually\nstunted in height. Third, observed intestinal permeability\nratios showed a rather large range of raw values, which\ncould not be explained by either morbidity or helminth\nIntestinal permeability in children 147\ninfestation although it was related to Giardia and to wean-\ning practices. Fourth, the children in this study were rela-\ntively old (mean age 45 months), so that the association\nbetween growth and intestinal permeability might not be\nclearly shown. By contrast, the studies in the Gambia\nfocused on infants 3\u201315-months-old, a time of life when\ndamage to the gut has its most significant effect on growth.\nConclusions\nThis study showed significant relationships between the\ntiming of weaning practices and two variables, intestinal per-\nmeability and growth status (height-for-age), even though\nthere was no direct association between intestinal per-\nmeability and stunting. A longer period of lactation was\nassociated with poorer L:M ratios and height-for-age,\nsuggesting that the expected protective effects of lactation\non mucosal function do not extend to older children past\nearly infancy. The study also found a significant association\nbetween Giardia infection and poor intestinal permeability,\ndespite the small number of children affected by protozoa\nin the sample. These results suggest complex relationships\nbetween children\u2019s age, the timing of weaning events, and\ngut function leading to food malabsorption. In clearly differ-\nentiating between onset of food supplementation and breast-\nfeeding cessation, the study highlights the differential impact\nof these two distinct stages of weaning on the health of chil-\ndren. In focusing on a population where breast-feeding lasts\nfor about 2 years, it also draws attention to associations\nbetween the late cessation of breast-feeding, growth and\ngut function, for children past infancy.\nAcknowledgements\nThis study was facilitated by affiliation with Tribhuvan\nUniversity, Kathmandu, Nepal, and financial assistance\nfrom the Infant and Child Research Network (ICRN), Uni-\nversity of Durham.\nReferences\nAlmedom AM (1991) Infant feeding in urban low-income house-\nholds in Ethiopia: Determinants of weaning.
