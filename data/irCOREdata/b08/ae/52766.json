Introduction\n[2] Extreme sea level events have immediate and obvious\nimpacts on the coast, unlike changes in mean sea level which\nare much longer term. The recent occurrence of major floods\nin hurricanes Katrina, Sidr, and Nargis have emphasized the\ndamage that storm surges are capable of, especially when\ncombined with the rise in coastal populations. Although the\nevidence for recent increases in the frequency and magnitude\nof extreme events is mixed, there is an obvious requirement\nto learn more about the statistics of extreme sea level events\nand of surges, partly as input to studies of extremes which\nmight occur in the future.\n[3] The observed sea level can be considered as a com-\nbination of four factors: mean sea level, tide, surge, and\nwaves. Waves are averaged out in most sea level records\nobtained from tide gauges, which tend to have samplings of\nseveral minutes up to an hour, and so we do not discuss their\ncontribution to the overall sea level signal further in the\npresent study.\n[4] Mean sea level (MSL) is the average level of the sea\nover a stated period relative to a fixed benchmark on land\nnear to the tide gauge. MSL has generally increased\nworldwide during the 20th century due to the thermal\nexpansion of sea water, the melting of ice sheets and gla-\nciers, and the hydrological exchanges between the land and\nthe ocean [Bindoff et al., 2007]. However, there are many\nlocations where the MSL (i.e., relative to land) is falling\nbecause the land upon which the gauge is situated is rising\n[e.g., Peltier, 2001]. High tidal levels contribute to the\noccurrence of extreme high water levels. Astronomical\nmodulations such as the equinoctal spring tides, the inter-\nannual perigean influence, or the nodal cycle can increase\nthe risk of flooding at specific times [Pugh, 1987]. Storm\nsurges are the result of low air pressures and the effect of\nwind stress in shallow\u2010water areas. Higher surge values are\nassociated with both midlatitude and tropical storms,\nalthough the most intense cyclones are not necessarily asso-\nciated with the largest coastal surges. Interactions between\nthe tide and surge may be important in some coastal areas,\nresulting in a modification of the surge height, depending on\ntide level. Changes in storminess and MSL, each of them a\nconsequence of climate change, may have an important\ncombined role in modifying the frequency and magnitude of\nextreme sea levels.\n[5] Currently, there are two main approaches to study the\nclimate variability of sea levels: studying the past and\nmodeling the future. The former makes a revision of his-\ntorical data sets based on instrumental measurements or\nnumerical modeling. This approach can include estimations\nof trends in extremes and correlations with other regional\nclimate parameters. Sophisticated extreme value analyses\nare also able to forecast future extreme values [i.e.,Men\u00e9ndez\net al., 2009b; Wang and Zhang, 2008]. The second\napproach is based on projections of future sea level ele-\nvations derived from meteorological fields extracted from\natmosphere\u2010ocean general circulation models [e.g., Lowe\net al., 2001]. In the present study, we confine ourselves\nto a study of historical data.\n1Environmental Hydraulic Institute, E.T.S. Ingenieros de Caminos,\nCanales y Puertos, Universidad de Cantabria, Santander, Spain.\n2Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory, Liverpool, UK.\nCopyright 2010 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148\u20100227\/10\/2009JC005997\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 115, C10011, doi:10.1029\/2009JC005997, 2010\nC10011 1 of 15\n[6] A number of studies have analyzed changes in his-\ntorical extreme high water levels, although most of them\nhave concentrated on a specific location or region and used\ndifferent methods and measurement epochs [Lowe et al.,\n2010]. Several of these studies concluded that there is evi-\ndence for an increase over time of high water levels [e.g.,\nAra\u00fajo and Pugh, 2008, for Newlyn and Brest; M\u00e9ndez\net al., 2007, for San Francisco]. The only investigation\nwhich has attempted a quasi\u2010global investigation is that of\nWoodworth and Blackman [2004], who employed a tide\ngauge data set similar to, but smaller than, that of the\npresent study.\n[7] Many studies have investigated whether extreme values\nare changing in a significantly different way to MSL. Zhang\net al. [2000] concluded that there was no discernible increase\nin modern storms over the U.S. West Coast during the last\ncentury and that the flooding has been exacerbated by the\neffect of the MSL rise. Bernier and Thompson [2006]\nobserved a small reduction in extreme events in the north-\nwest Atlantic between 1960 and 1999 because of changes in\natmospheric conditions. The lack of trends in the nontidal sea\nlevel variability around the United Kingdom was noted by\nPugh and Maul [1999] over the last century. In the Medi-\nterranean, a decrease of strong positive surges in the northern\nAdriatic was detected by Raicich [2003] and Marcos et al.\n[2009]. Bromirski et al. [2003] found a substantial increas-\ning trend in winter extreme surges at San Francisco since\nabout 1950. Church et al. [2006] observed an increase in the\nfrequency of high water levels (storm surges plus MSL rise)\nto the post\u20101950 period for two tide gauges on the east and\nwest Australian coasts, consistent with increased regional\ncoastal flooding.\n[8] This paper investigates the worldwide patterns of\nhistorical extreme sea level changes by means of an extreme\nvalue analysis applied to a quasi\u2010global sea level data set.\nThe paper is organized as follow. In section 2, the tide gauge\ndata set is briefly described. In section 3, we describe the\nnonstationary extreme statistical approach. The different\ntime scale variations are measured statistically using a time\u2010\ndependent generalized extreme value distribution and a\nnonhomogeneous Poisson process. Section 4 provides a\ndiscussion of the month within a year that presents more\nprobability for a high water level, trends in high water levels\nand storm surges, and explores the relationship of ocean and\natmospheric variability. The question of whether there is a\ndifferent behavior in extremes over and above the much\u2010\nstudied MSL variability is also examined. Finally, in section\n5 we present some concluding comments.\n2. Sea Level Data Set\n[9] This work makes use of the Global Extreme Sea Level\nAnalysis (GESLA) quasi\u2010global tide gauge data set which\nhas been collected by the Antarctic Climate and Ecosystems\nCooperative Research Centre (ACE CRC) and the Proudman\nOceanographic Laboratory. The present version of the data\nset consists of 675 separate sea level records, the majority of\nthem coming from the archives of the University of Hawaii\nSea Level Center (data available at http:\/\/uhslc.soest.hawaii.\nedu) and the Global Sea Level Observing System (data\navailable at www.gloss\u2010sealevel.org). Other records were\nobtained from a number of national data centers.\n[10] The data set required preprocessing. It contains\nduplicate records, jumps in datum, obvious outliers, and\ndifferent sampling intervals, even within the same station\nrecords. Jumps in datum were corrected by assessing the\ndifference in the mean for similar time spans and outliers\nwere removed. Hourly values, which comprise the most\nusual sampling, have been selected by subsampling any\nhigher frequency data.\n[11] Once the GESLA data set was preprocessed, two\nperiods of time were analyzed: the period of 1970 onward, to\nstudy variability in recent decades (we have chosen stations to\nhave at least 15 years of sea level data), and records with at\nleast 60 years of sea level data, which give us information\nabout variations during the last century. Figure 1 shows the\ngeographical distribution of the whole GESLA data set and\nthe selected stations for the extreme value analyses (258 for\nthe study of variability in recent decades and 49 for estimating\nlong\u2010term variations).\n[12] The GESLA data set has a worldwide spatial distri-\nbution. However, the Southern Hemisphere has poorer\ngeographical coverage than the Northern Hemisphere and\nshorter records. It provides poor coverage for stations with\ndata after 1970 in the Indian Ocean and limited scope for\nstudy of longer records in the Southern Hemisphere.\n[13] Two variables are examined in this work: the total sea\nlevel elevation for each station and the surge component.\nThe analysis of the total sea level variable provides valuable\ninformation on flooding risk, while information on surges\nprovides insight into changes in storm activity.\n[14] The tidal component was subtracted from each station\nrecord in order to obtain the residual signal. The residuals\nwere obtained by subjecting two consecutive years of data to\na tidal analysis with the use of the Tidal Analysis Software\nKit (TASK) (TASK data available at www.psmsl.org\/\ntrain_and_info\/software\/task2K.php) and with a standard set\nof 63 harmonic constituents. The residuals for the middle\n12 months of each set of two calendar years of data were\nselected; the MSL and its seasonal cycle having been defined\nseparately within the tidal analysis. In this case, the residual\nsignal can be considered as a \u201csurge\u201d component.\n3. Methodology\n[15] The approaches to study variations in extreme sea\nlevel events can be thought of as either changes in the\nmagnitude of the higher water level events or, alternatively,\nchanges on the occurrence of these extreme events. An\napproach based on magnitude allows for the estimation of\nthe water levels associated with high\u2010return periods and\nmakes use of more information about the extreme sea level\nevents than in the frequency analysis. The frequency\napproach makes use of only the timing of extreme sea level\nevents and avoids the possible errors in height of the higher\nwater level measurements. Here, two models are proposed\nto study changes in extreme high water levels: a time\u2010\ndependent generalized extreme value distribution (GEVD)\nand a nonhomogeneous Poisson process. The maximum\nlikelihood method is used to fit these models [Coles, 2001;\nCastillo et al., 2005].\nMEN\u00c9NDEZ AND WOODWORTH: CHANGES IN EXTREME SEA LEVELS C10011C10011\n2 of 15\n3.1. Selection of Extreme Values\n[16] Several possible techniques have been used to char-\nacterize extreme sea level events: high annual percentiles\n[e.g., Woodworth and Blackman, 2004], maxima in a block\nof time [e.g., Ara\u00fajo and Pugh, 2008; M\u00e9ndez et al., 2007],\nmaxima of r events per year [e.g., Marcos et al., 2009], and\nthe peaks over a certain threshold [Zhang et al., 2000]. The\nuse of high percentiles solves the problem of a possible bias\nin annual maxima due to incorrectly measured hourly values\n[Woodworth and Blackman, 2002], but it is not possible to\nuse them for the estimation of high water levels associated\nwith return periods. The main difficulties with the annual\nmaxima method (the simplest and most widely used in\nextreme analysis) are to do with data incompleteness and not\ntaking into account the possibility of several extreme events\nwithin a year. The latter is solved by the methods which select\nshorter time blocks than a year, the r\u2010largest values within a\nyear, or the maximum values over a threshold.\n[17] The method used here makes use of monthly maxima\n(MM). In the present analysis, gaps summing to more than\n40% of the hourly values for a given month invalidate the\nuse of this monthly maximum. The MM method solves the\nproblem of strong biasing in annual values if the record\ncontains occasional data gaps, and modeling the seasonal\ndependence is essential for a good estimation of high\u2010return\nperiods.\n[18] Although tide and surge are major components of the\nsea surface record, variations due to mean sea level rise,\ncrustal motions, and local geographical changes may also be\nrepresented in the total elevations. Following Woodworth\nand Blackman [2004], in order to investigate any climate\nvariability in extreme sea level over and above changes in\nMSL, the annual median of the hourly values has been\nsubtracted from each MM. The monthly maxima with the\nannual median reduced (MMR) are not then affected by\nvertical land movements and datum uncertainties. A com-\nparison of climate variability between the MM of total\nelevations and MMR might inform us whether the variability\nof the most severe sea level events is similar to that in the\nMSL.\n[19] On the other hand, extreme sea levels may not always\narise from high tide levels combined with extreme surges.\nSometimes, they may be determined primarily by extreme\ntides and moderate surges, whereas in other cases, it is\nprimarily the extreme surges in combination with moderate\ntides that are important. Even in cases when surge is the\npredominant factor in high water levels, there may be a\nnonlinear interaction between the surge and tide that may\ncause a maximum residual at a time offset from the overall\nhigh water level [Horsburgh and Wilson, 2007]. Because\nsurge maxima are of great interest in climate research with\nregard to possible changes in the frequency and magnitude\nof storms, and as they are of potential importance to flood\nrisk if they occur at high tide, the MM of surge have also\nbeen analyzed.\n[20] The timing of the higher extreme sea level events for\nthe frequency analysis has been defined by the peak over\nthreshold (POT) technique. The threshold has to be high\nenough to ensure that exceedances describe real extreme\nevents. In the present analysis, the threshold for each station\nhas been set at the 99.5 percentile of the complete record. A\ntime span of five days has been required between successive\nevents to ensure independence between events. An average\nof four to five extreme events per year is found in this way\nfor the majority of stations.\nFigure 1.

GEVD Model\n[21] The justification for using the GEVD is that it cor-\nresponds to the class of all possible limiting distributions for\nmaxima. Moreover, the POT approach converges to the\nGEVD [Pickands, 1975]. The three\u2010parameter cumulative\ndistribution function of the GEVD is given by\nFt z\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc\nexp \u0002 1\u00fe \u0001 z\u0002 \u0003 t\u00f0 \u00de\ny t\u00f0 \u00de\n\u0001 \u0003\u0004 \u0005\u00021=\u0001\n\u00fe\n( )\n\u0001 6\u00bc 0\nexp \u0002 exp \u0002 z\u0002 \u0003 t\u00f0 \u00de\ny t\u00f0 \u00de\n\u0001 \u0003\u0004 \u0005\u0006 \u0007\n\u0001 \u00bc 0;\n8>><\n>>:\n\u00f01\u00de\nwhere [a]+ = max [a, 0], m is the location parameter, y > 0 is\nthe scale parameter, and x is the shape parameter. The\nGEVD includes three distribution families corresponding to\nthe different types of the tail behavior: the Gumbel family,\nthe Fr\u00e9chet distribution, and the Weibull family.\n[22] Note that GEVD has a time\u2010dependent location m(t)\nand scale parameter, y (t) > 0. The extension for nonsta-\ntionary implies that the properties of the statistical distri-\nbution change through time. Therefore, the probability of a\ncertain extreme high water level (or surge) may be larger in\nwinter (variations within a year), in a strong El Ni\u00f1o year\n(interannual variations), or in the future (in the case of a\nsecular increase).\n[23] For nonstationary or time\u2010dependent GEVD, the\ncalculation of time\u2010dependent return\u2010level quantiles zR(t, \u0004)\nassociated with the return period R (in years) can be carried\nout by using\nZR t; \u0004\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc ZR \u0003 t\u00f0 \u00de;y t\u00f0 \u00de; \u0001\u00f0 \u00de\n\u00bc\n\u0003 t\u00f0 \u00de \u0002 y t\u00f0 \u00de\u0001 1\u0002 \u0002 log 1\u0002 1=R\u00f0 \u00def g\u0002\u0001\nh i\n\u0001 t\u00f0 \u00de 6\u00bc 0\n\u0003 t\u00f0 \u00de \u0002 y t\u00f0 \u00de log \u0002 log 1\u0002 1=R\u00f0 \u00def g \u0001 t\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc 0:\n8<\n:\n\u00f02\u00de\nThe estimation of the return sea level quantile zR for a\ncertain year ti is obtained by solving\n1\u0002 1=R \u00bc\nexp \u0002 R ti\u00feTti 1\u00fe \u0001 \u0001zR \u0002 \u0003 t\u00f0 \u00de\u00f0 \u00de=y t\u00f0 \u00de\u00bd \u0003\u00021=\u0001\u00fe dt\nn o\nexp \u0002 R ti\u00feTti exp \u0003 t\u00f0 \u00de \u0002 \u0001zR\u00f0 \u00de=y t\u00f0 \u00de\u00bd \u0003dt\nn o\n;\n8><\n>: \u00f03\u00de\nwhere T is one year.\n3.2.2. Nonhomogeneous Poisson Process\n[24] Assuming that the extreme high water level events\nare statistically independent of each other, their frequencies\ncan be estimated using nonhomogeneous Poisson processes.\nUnder the Poisson hypothesis, the cumulative distribution\nfunction of the time ti at which the ith event occurs condi-\ntioned by the time ti\u22121 of the previous event is given by\nF tijti\u00021\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc 1\u0002 exp \u0002\nZ ti\nti\u00021\nv t\u00f0 \u00dedt\n\u0004 \u0005\n; \u00f04\u00de\nwhere v(t) is the occurrence rate. Note that v(t) is a function\nof time. It implies that the number of events in a time span\n(e.g., one year) is not the same through time.\n3.2.3. Seasonal Dependence\n[25] Mean sea level seasonal oscillations have been\nwidely studied [e.g., Tsimplis and Woodworth, 1994]. This\nvariability is due to local meteorological, oceanographic,\nand hydrological forcings. In general, the seasonal depen-\ndence in extreme sea levels is mainly caused by astronom-\nical (spring tides) and meteorological (storminess season)\ncomponents, although a runoff component can be important\nin some locations [e.g., Singh, 2001; Kang et al., 2008].\n[26] The importance of seasonal variations in extreme\nstatistical analysis of climate parameters has been noted\npreviously. Carter and Challenor [1981] demonstrated,\nusing independent monthly extreme distributions of wave\nheights, that the probability of the occurrence of an extreme\nwave height changes within the year, while Katz et al.\n[2002] obtained a better fit to the data, assuming that the\nannual maximum of daily precipitation depends on a par-\nticular day within a year.\n[27] In this approach, the seasonal variability is explicitly\nmodeled by the possibility of annual and semiannual cycles\nin the location and scale parameters. Mathematically, these\nseasonal cycles are included through sinusoidal functions:\n\u0003S t\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc \u00050 \u00fe\nX2\ni\u00bc1\n\u00052i\u00021 cos i!t\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe \u00052i sin i!t\u00f0 \u00de\u00bd \u0003\nyS t\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc \u00060 \u00fe\nX2\ni\u00bc1\n\u00062i\u00021 cos i!t\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe \u00062i sin i!t\u00f0 \u00de\u00bd \u0003;\n\u00f05\u00de\nwhere b0 and a0 are averaged values, bi and ai are the\namplitudes of the harmonics, w = 2p years\u22121 , and time t is\ngiven in years.\n[28] In order to find the simplest model with a minimum\nnumber of time\u2010dependent parameters, we employ a step-\nwise procedure evaluating the final prediction error (FPE)\ncriterion [Akaike, 1973; Men\u00e9ndez et al., 2009a].\nFPE \u00bc \u00022\u2018^ p\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe n log n\u00fe p\nn\u0002 p\n\u0001 \u0003\n; \u00f06\u00de\nwhere \u2018^ is the log likelihood function (logarithm of joint\nprobability density function for the sample of MM), n is the\nnumber of MM, and p is the number of parameters.\n[29] The stepwise algorithm starts with a stationary model\nand tests the incorporation of seasonal cycles by evaluating\nthe FPE criterion. Only significant sinusoidal functions\n(equation (5)) are hence included into the optimal model for\neach station (see Men\u00e9ndez et al. [2009a] for more details).\nStandard likelihood theory is used to obtain the model\nparameter estimates \u0005^i, \u0006^i [Coles, 2001].\n3.2.4. Interannual Variations and Long\u2010Term Trends\n[30] Interannual and decadal fluctuations are also present\nin extreme sea levels. This variability may be dependent on\nregional climate patterns which are often represented by\nteleconnection indices. The main coupled ocean\u2010atmosphere\nmodes affecting climate anomalies on a large regional scale\nare the El Ni\u00f1o\u2010Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the North\nAtlantic Oscillation (NAO), but many other climate modes\nhave been used to describe climate variability.\n[31] Eight relevant climate indices have been selected to\ninvestigate teleconnections in extreme high waters changes:\nMEN\u00c9NDEZ AND WOODWORTH: CHANGES IN EXTREME SEA LEVELS C10011C10011\n4 of 15\nNi\u00f1o3, which is the main descriptor of ENSO; NAO, which\nis the major mode in the North Atlantic [Jones et al., 1997];\nthe Arctic Oscillation (AO); the Antarctic Oscillation\n(AAO); the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD); the East Atlantic\nOscillation (EA); the East Atlantic\/Western Russian Oscil-\nlation (EAWR); the Scandinavian index (SCA), and the\nPacific\u2010North America Index (PNA). Indices that inform\nabout decadal fluctuations (e.g., the Pacific Decadal Oscil-\nlation, PDO) are not considered, because we are studying\nclimate variability primarily from the perspective of the past\nfour decades. AAO was selected from the British Antarctic\nSurvey (data available at http:\/\/www.nerc\u2010bas.ac.uk\/icd\/\ngjma\/sam.html), IOD was selected from the Japan Agency\nfor Marine\u2010Earth Science and Technology (data available at\nhttp:\/\/www.jamstec.go.jp), NAO was selected from the\nClimate Research Unit of the University of East Anglia\n(data available at http:\/\/www.cru.uea.ac.uk\/cru), and the rest\nof the climate indices were selected from the National\nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2010National Weather\nService (data available at http:\/\/www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov).\n[32] AO and AAO, also called the annular modes, are the\nmost important patterns of climate variability in the North-\nern and Southern Hemispheres. The AO has a similar pat-\ntern in the Atlantic to the NAO, but it covers more of the\nArctic and North Pacific, and AAO describes the strength of\nthe westerly winds in the Southern Ocean. The IOD has a\nFigure 2. (a) Tidal range in meters and (b) nontidal residual\nrange, in centimeters.\nFigure 3. Model results of seasonality for four stations. Crosses represent the monthly maxima (meters),\nthick lines represent the 50 year time\u2010dependent quantile, and the horizontal line represents the estimated\n50 year annual return level.

EA is\nstructurally similar to the NAO, so that these two modes\nappear to be interdependent. However, the lower latitude\ncenter of action of the EA contains a strong subtropical link\nassociated with modulations in subtropical ridge intensity\nand location. This subtropical link makes the EA pattern\ndistinct from its NAO counterpart. The PNA is a prominent\nmode in the extratropical Pacific, while the EAWR and SCA\nare secondary modes of climate variability in the North\nAtlantic. The EAWR affects Eurasia throughout the year\nand is also linked to eastern Asia and Northwest Canada.\nFinally, the SCA pattern consists of a primary circulation\ncenter that spans Scandinavia and large portions of the\nArctic Ocean, north of Siberia. These indices are based on\nthe normalized air pressure difference between specific\ncenters, except Ni\u00f1o3 and IOD which are based on averaged\nsea surface temperatures in a region.\n[33] We formulate the statistical relationship of climate\nindices in extreme sea levels by adding a new linear term in\nthe location parameter of the GEVD: m(t) = mS(t) + bCI Clim.\nIndex(t). Thus, the parameter bCI (m\/unit of climate index)\nindicates the sensitivity of the climate pattern in the extreme\nsea level. The likelihood ratio test is used to estimate the\nsignificance level and confidence intervals of the climate\nterm.\n[34] A complication in interannual extreme high water\nlevel variability is the low\u2010frequency fluctuations of ocean\ntides. The nodal (18.6 year) component and the quasi 4.4\nyear periodicity of the perigean components may be seen in\nthe higher water levels where the tide range is large. These\nfluctuations are modeled using the expression m(t) = mS(t) +\nbN1 cos(wt\/T) + bN2 sin(wt\/T), where T is the corresponding\nperiod.\n[35] To account for long\u2010term variability, a possible trend\nwas also included into the extreme model. Trends were\ncomputed using a linear time dependence in the location and\nscale parameters of the GEVD (i.e., for the location\nparameter, m(t) = mS(t) + bLTt). Therefore, the model is able\nto simulate the increase or decrease, not only in the mag-\nnitude of the extreme events, but also in their variance. The\nsignificance of each linear trend is computed by using the\nlikelihood ratio test.\n4. Results\n[36] In order to obtain an idea of the spatial description in\nthe magnitude of the tide and surge, the tidal and surge\nFigure 4. (Top) Month of highest water level and (bottom) month of highest nontidal residual level.\nMEN\u00c9NDEZ AND WOODWORTH: CHANGES IN EXTREME SEA LEVELS C10011C10011\n6 of 15\nranges are displayed in Figure 2. The range was defined in\nterms of the difference between the 0.5 and 99.5 percentiles\nof each record. Tidal ranges of 5 m or more are found along\nthe western European coast, the northwest of Australia, the\nGulf of Alaska, the Bay of Fundy, and the East China Sea.\nRegions of higher surge contributions include northern\nEurope, the Chinese coast, southern Australia, the extra-\ntropical Atlantic coast of America, and the Gulf of Alaska.\n4.1. Variations Within a Year\n[37] Since extreme high water levels have a strong sea-\nsonal dependence, an intra\u2010annual dependence was incor-\nporated into the model (Figure 3). The evidence of this\nvariation has been found previously for the San Francisco\nand Newlyn tide gauges [Mendez et al., 2007; Men\u00e9ndez\net al., 2009b].\n[38] The combination of both astronomical tidal and surge\ncomponents defines the overall variation of extreme sea\nlevels within a year. After the stepwise analysis, about 90%\nof the sea level records in the analyzed stations successfully\nfit a seasonal model composed of an annual and semiannual\ncomponent in the location parameter and an annual cycle in\nthe scale parameter of the GEVD. The incorporation of\nseasonal dependence into the extreme model has the\nadvantage of allowing the assessment of return level values\non a seasonal or monthly scale. Therefore, we are able to\nassess the time of the maximum probability of occurrence of\nan extreme event within a year.\n[39] Figure 4a shows the spatial distribution of the month\nwhich presents the greatest probability of a high water level\nvalue. These results are for the total elevations. Therefore,\nthey may be influenced by local factors such as river runoff\nand interactions between tide and surge due to shallow\nwaters. However, they are of primary interest in the\nassessment of flooding risk. The assessment is made by\nestimating the timing of the largest 50 year return values\nwithin a year. The spatial coherence in the results between\nthe studied stations indicates the good quality of the data set.\n[40] A clear winter pattern for high water levels is found\nalong European and North American coasts. The maximum\nprobability of high water levels is found to be in the middle\nof the winter season in northern Europe. Instead, the western\nEuropean coast (United Kingdom and the Atlantic coasts of\nFrance and Iberia) presents higher probability in the late\nwinter or beginning of spring. A gradual south\u2010north spatial\ndistribution from October (in the Caribbean and Gulf coasts)\nto January appears in northeast United States and Canada,\nindicating the change in meteorological dominance from\nFigure 5. Estimated trends in (top) annual 99th percentile of sea level, (middle) 99th percentile reduced\nto medians, and (bottom) 99th percentile of the nontidal residual. Only trends at a confidence level above\n95% are shown in color: red for positive trends and blue for negative trends.\nMEN\u00c9NDEZ AND WOODWORTH: CHANGES IN EXTREME SEA LEVELS C10011C10011\n7 of 15\ntropical storms to northeasters [Zhang et al., 2000]. May and\nJune are the more likely months for higher water levels in\nthe south of Australia, April and March are the more likely\nmonths for higher water levels in the northwest of Australia,\nand February and January are the more likely months for\nhigher water levels in the northeast. Japanese and Chinese\ncoasts show extreme water levels during the months from\nJuly to September, when typhoons propagate west across the\nPacific Ocean. A maximum probability of high water levels\nis found in August for the Bangladesh coast, as might be\nexpected from the monsoon season.\n[41] Figure 4b shows the month of higher probability for\nan extreme nontidal residual. A spatial seasonal pattern of\nstorminess is observed throughout the winter season in high\nlatitudes (December\u2013January for North America and Europe\nand June\u2013July south of 20\u00b0S), and the September storm\nsurges caused by typhoons in the western Pacific can be\nobserved. The relative importance of nontidal residual to\nextreme high water levels can be observed in the differences\nbetween Figures 4a and 4b. The different months in western\nEurope, the central and south Pacific, the American coast,\nand northwest Australia suggest tidal dominance in extreme\nsea level events in these areas.\n4.2. Long\u2010Term Trends\n[42] We have made use of different methods to validate\nthe estimations of trends in extreme high waters events. A\npreliminary analysis of the trends in the high percentiles of\nthe hourly time series from 1970 onward was developed\nfollowing a similar procedure to that reported by\nWoodworth and Blackman [2004]. Years of data with less\nthan 75% of hourly values were rejected. Trends in the 99\nFigure 6. Estimated trends (cm\/10 yr) in a 50 year return period of sea level from (a) total elevation,\n(b) total elevation after removal of annual medians, and (c) 50 year return nontidal residual. Only trends\nstatistically significant at the 95% confidence level are colored.\nMEN\u00c9NDEZ AND WOODWORTH: CHANGES IN EXTREME SEA LEVELS C10011C10011\n8 of 15\npercentile of the total elevations and in the corresponding\ntime series reduced to medians were computed using linear\nregression with allowance for a perigean component. In\naddition, trends in the same percentiles for the surge com-\nponent were computed using linear regression (Figure 5).\n[43] Regarding the GEVD model, once the best model\nfor parameterizing the seasonal dependence of MM has\nbeen obtained, the long\u2010term trends of the extreme high\nwaters or surges can be analyzed. The estimation of long\u2010\nterm trends is computed with allowance for trends in the\nlocation and scale parameters of the GEVD, as described\nabove. In the cases that the trends in the location or the scale\nparameter are statistically significant, the trends in the esti-\nmated quantile of the 50 year return periods are computed\n(Figure 6).\n[44] Figure 6a shows the estimated trend of the 50 year\nreturn high water level for total sea level observations since\n1970. A spatial coherence in the trend gives confidence in\nthe analysis and in the general data quality, even though\nsome local behavior is apparent. A general increase is\nobserved for the majority of the stations at our disposal. This\nsupports the assertions that extreme high\u2010water levels have\nincreased worldwide in recent decades. Pertinent positive\ntrends are found in the North Sea [Langenberg et al., 1999],\nthe east coast of the United States [Zhang et al., 2000], and\nthe west and central Pacific. In contrast, a negative trend is\ndetected in the Arctic and Alaskan parts of northern\nAmerica [Larsen et al., 2003] and Scandinavia.\n[45] A plot of the trends in the 50 year return level\nquantile from the MMR is shown in Figure 6b. Most of the\npositive trends disappear when the MSL variations are\nremoved from the extreme values. This implies that the\ngeneral world increase in extreme high water levels is due\nto changes in MSL rather than in storminess. Even so,\nincreases in extremes remain in the North Sea and mon-\nsoonal regions (the Bay of Bengal, Malaysia, and the South\nChina Sea). A decrease in extreme high water levels also\nappears along the northwest coast of Australia.\n[46] A generally similar spatial distribution of trends was\nfound for the high percentile and GEVD methods along the\nworld coastline (Figures 5 and 6), although differences were\nfound for the estimated trends of the MMR in Europe and the\nwestern Pacific. These differences may be attributed to the\ndifferent analyzed values (i.e., 99th percentile rather than\ntrue extreme) and methodology (i.e., linear regression rather\nthan extreme value analysis based on maximum likelihood).\n[47] The increase or decrease in the rate of occurrence of\nextreme sea level events was estimated by a nonhomoge-\nneous Poisson process in a complementary analysis. The\nfrequency model was applied to the extreme events of total\nsea level and annual median reduced sea level during the\nperiod of 1970 onward and considers a time\u2010dependent\noccurrence rate with allowance for the annual cycle, the\nperigean component, the nodal component, and long\u2010term\ntrends.\n[48] In a complementary set of findings to those reported\nabove for Figures 5 and 6, a general increase in occurrence\nof extreme sea level events is observed in the majority of the\nstations (Figure 7a). Results for the annual median reduced\nsea level time series contain a much reduced number of\nsignificant trends, as is to be expected if the number of\nexceedances over threshold are due to the MSL variations\n(Figure 7b), while small increases occur along the coasts of\nAustralia, the west Pacific, Alaska, and United Kingdom.\n[49] In order to obtain information on extreme sea level\nvariability on longer timescales, trends in the longer records\nFigure 7. (a) Estimated changes in the frequency of extreme sea level events for the total elevation time\nseries and (b) for the time series with the annual median removed. Changes are the annual percentage of\nincrease\/decrease in the occurrence of extreme events relative to the average occurrence rate. Black dots\nindicate trends with a level of significance below 5%.\nMEN\u00c9NDEZ AND WOODWORTH: CHANGES IN EXTREME SEA LEVELS C10011C10011\n9 of 15\nof the data set have been computed separately with the same\nGEVD method described above. We restricted ourselves to\n60 years or more of good quality data, with the result that we\nwere only able to estimate long\u2010term trends for the coasts of\nthe United States, Europe, and south of Australia (red\nsquares in Figure 1).\n[50] The estimated trends in North America are displayed\nin Figure 8. Extreme value analysis of the long records\nconfirms the secular increase on high waters along the U. S.\neast coast (Figure 8a), although it can be seen that this red\ngrouping disappears for the MMR analysis (Figures 8b and\n8d). A negative trend along the Gulf of Alaska and the\nnorthern U. S. Atlantic coast of the nontidal residual\n(Figure 8e) indicates a reduction of storm activity on these\nareas in recent decades [e.g., Bernier and Thompson, 2006].\n[51] Figure 9 shows estimated trends for tide gauges\naround Europe. Results for the total elevation since 1970\n(Figure 9c) show an increase in extreme high water levels in\nnorthwest Europe, but that increase does not apply for the\nwhole century (Figure 9a). The only common trends\nbetween the analysis for the last century and those for recent\ndecades are decreases in the Baltic Sea, although they\ncompletely disappear after the annual median subtraction,\nsuggesting vertical crustal motion as the main cause. The\nFigure 8.

This may represent an\nincrement in the extent of the climate forcing that causes the\nhigher water levels during recent decades. The analysis of\ntrends in the nontidal residual since 1970 shows only a few\nsites with statistically significant trends (Figure 9e), which\nmay indicate no increase in the storminess.\n4.3. Interannual Variability\n[52] The presence of interannual and decadal variations is\ncommonplace in extreme sea level and surge records. The\nremoval of the annual median in sea level subtracts much of\nthe interannual variability that is responsible for changes in\nMSL. However, high water levels can also include long\u2010\nperiod tidal components that are not represented in the MSL\ntime series. For example, the perigean influence is evident in\nthe highest percentile series for the Tuvalu tide gauge\nFigure 9. (a) Estimated trends (cm\/10 yr) in the 50 year return sea levels for the total elevation during\nthe last century, (b) similar distribution to Figure 9a but with the annual median removed, (c) estimated\ntrends in the 50 year return sea level for recent decades, (d) similar to Figure 9c but with the annual\nmedian removed, and (e) trends in the 50 year return nontidal residual since 1970. Only trends significant\nat the 95% confidence level are colored.\nMEN\u00c9NDEZ AND WOODWORTH: CHANGES IN EXTREME SEA LEVELS C10011C10011\n11 of 15\n[Woodworth and Blackman, 2004]. In order to evaluate the\nrole of these fluctuations in the extreme sea levels, the\nsensitivities of the nodal and perigean cycles have been\ncomputed for the MMR (Figure 10). In the present GEVD\nanalysis, the perigean influence was found to be statistically\nsignificant in North America, the South China Sea, and at\nseveral locations in the east and south of Australia, although\nwith an amplitude of less than 3 cm (Figure 10b). Signals for\nthe nodal component were found to be significant, with\namplitudes of up to 5 cm in the northeast Atlantic and the\nSouth China Sea (Figure 10a). We note the limitations of\nobtaining nodal findings from only two cycles of data in the\nrecords commencing in 1970.\n[53] The impact of the climate indices described above has\nalso been computed. The extreme model with the inclusion\nof climate index terms was applied to the MM of three\nvariables: total sea level elevations, sea levels with the\nannual median subtracted, and nontidal residuals. Figure 11a\nshows the sites for which the MM water levels are affected\nby ENSO. The sites for significance above the 95% confi-\ndence level in the bCI parameter are shown. Results verify\nthe association between the ENSO and the interannual sea\nlevel variability along the whole west coast of America and\nthe western tropical Pacific. The propagation of the ENSO\nsignal into the Indian Ocean through the Indonesian\nthroughflow can be seen along the west and south coasts of\nAustralia. The positive relationship along the west coast of\nthe United States indicates a higher probability of a high\nwater level during intense ENSO events. By contrast, the\ntropical west Pacific and the coast of Australia show sen-\nsitivity with reverse sign. Therefore, high sea levels are\nmore probable in those areas during La Ni\u00f1a events [Feng\net al., 2004]. The relationship is still significant along the\nwest American coast and the western Pacific basin for the\nMMR, but it is reduced by a factor of one half (not shown).\nThis is to be expected, since much of the lower frequency\nbehavior of the ENSO\u2010related sea level variability will have\nbeen removed by the annual median subtraction. Results for\nthe extreme nontidal residual show a stronger effect in the\ntropical Pacific, the southwest American coast, the northwest\nAtlantic, and western Australia (Figure 11b).\n[54] The AO shows the second dominant large\u2010scale\nclimate. Positive significant relations are obtained for the\nnorthern European stations, but a negative relation is also\ndetected in southern Europe and the northwest Atlantic.\nThe IOD shows a similar result for extreme water levels,\nas for Ni\u00f1o3 in the Southern Hemisphere and higher\nsensitivities for the Bay of Bengal sites. However, no\nsignificant relationships are found for MMR total elevations\nand nontidal residuals. The AAO and PNA indices have no\nsignificant relationships in the extremes of any analyzed\ntide gauge.\n[55] The AO, NAO, EA, EAWR, and SCA indices have\nan important impact on the variability of the extreme sea\nFigure 10. Amplitude (cm) of the (a) nodal cycle and the (b) quasi 4.4 year periodic perigean influence.\nBlack dots show tide fluctuations with a confidence level below 90%.\nMEN\u00c9NDEZ AND WOODWORTH: CHANGES IN EXTREME SEA LEVELS C10011C10011\n12 of 15\nlevels along the European coast. Apart from the EAWR\nindex, results for extremes in total sea level, annual median\nreduced sea level, and nontidal residual provide similar\nspatial results. This demonstrates that the same climate\ndynamics are affecting the climate variability of MSL, the\nextreme sea levels, and storminess in Europe. Figure 12\nshows a set of maps of the most significant climate indi-\nces for MMR in the European region. Results for the NAO\nindex show a similar spatial pattern as for the AO, with\nhigher statistical relationships for the northern European\nstations. The EA index has the highest values of the esti-\nmated parameter bCI on the west coast of the United\nKingdom, while the SCA index presents dipole sensitivity\nbetween southwest Europe and Scandinavia.\n5. Conclusions\n[56] A data set of 258 hourly sea level records from tide\ngauges has been used to investigate the spatial and temporal\nvariabilities of extreme high water levels worldwide. The\nstatistical extreme value approach applied to both the total\nelevations and to the nontidal residuals provides quantitative\nmeasures of change in extreme sea level events.\n[57] Analysis of seasonal variations shows that they play\nan important role in the occurrence and magnitude of\nextreme sea levels. The combination of spring tides and\nstorm surges determine the amplitude and month within a\nyear of higher probability for an extreme sea level event,\nwhich may be useful information for coastal management.\nResults demonstrate that the month with the greatest\nextreme is not always in the middle of the winter season.\n[58] Pronounced trends in recent decades have been found\nto be prominent features of the extreme sea level distribution\nalong the global coastline. Our present analysis confirms\nthat there has indeed been an increase in extreme high water\nlevels worldwide since 1970. In order to study whether the\nobserved changes of extreme high waters are due to factors\nother than the generally underlying MSL rise, analyses were\nmade with the annual median sea level removed from the\nextremes. Results show that the MSL rise is the major rea-\nson for the rise in extreme high water at most stations.\n[59] Our study, within the limitations of the small number\nof long records available, indicates that, in general, there\nwas a greater rate of increase in high water levels in recent\ndecades than for the 20th century overall. This finding\ndemonstrates the importance of consideration of decadal\nvariations and accelerations in extremes similar to those in\nmean sea levels [e.g. Church and White, 2006].\n[60] Prominent positive trends are detected in the tropical\nPacific and monsoonal regions. The negative trends in\nextreme sea levels observed in the Gulf of Alaska and the\nBaltic Sea could be due to crustal uplift in those regions\n[e.g., Larsen et al., 2003]. The estimated increases in high\nwater levels of the east coast of the United States, reported in\nFigure 11. (a) Sensitivity of change in extreme sea levels to the Ni\u00f1o3 index (m\/unit index) and\n(b) corresponding sensitivity in extreme nontidal residual. Only statistically significant relations at the\n95% confidence level are colored.\nMEN\u00c9NDEZ AND WOODWORTH: CHANGES IN EXTREME SEA LEVELS C10011C10011\n13 of 15\nthe present study for recent decades, are consistent with\nearlier research [Zhang et al., 2000]. The positive trends\nalong the east coast of the United States in observed extreme\nsea levels have persisted throughout the last century. How-\never, once again, significant trends are not found for the same\nextreme sea levels with the annual median reduced. The\nmaximum surges show a decrease in the northern part of the\ncoast and an increase on the Gulf Coast. Therefore, the effect\nof the mean sea level rise over the last century has been a\nmajor factor on the impact of storm surges, causing an\nincrease of higher waters levels.\n[61] The European Atlantic coast is one of the regions\nwith the highest sea level variations, with tidal ranges from 3\nm to more than 10 m and with storm surges, on occasion, of\nover a meter. Significant positive trends were computed for\nrecent decades in extreme values of total elevation. Never-\ntheless, there were no significant trends in storm surge levels,\nindicating that changes in extreme sea level events are caused\nby natural climate fluctuations in storminess together with\nchanges in the MSL.\n[62] The interannual fluctuations in extreme values have\nbeen shown to be related to changes in regional climate\npatterns. An important impact of the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon\nhas been found throughout the Pacific Ocean and the\nmonsoonal region, while the apparent increase of high water\nlevels in Europe may be governed to some extent by the\nocean\u2010atmosphere circulation patterns. El Ni\u00f1o is revealed\nto be one of the most important forcings responsible for the\ninterannual fluctuations of the extreme sea levels, and these\ninterannual\u2010to\u2010decadal variations will have played a role in\nthe trends computed in extreme sea levels for 1970 onwards.\nMeanwhile, the impact of astronomical tidal contributions to\nthe extreme sea levels has been found especially significant\nalong the northern American coast, northwestern Europe,\nthe South China Sea, and Australia.\n[63] We must state that the present study forms only the\nfirst of what we hope will eventually be a considerably\nexpanded GESLA data set which we intend to compile with\nthe cooperation of sea level agencies. We look forward to\nlearning more about the space and time scales of extreme\nsea levels with the use of that expanded global data set.\n[64] Acknowledgments.
