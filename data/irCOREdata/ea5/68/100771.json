INTRODUCTION\nNuclei in the A\u2248 100 region with neutron number above\n50 generally follow a transition from spherical toward prolate\ndeformed ground states. Particularly interesting in this region\nis the onset of large nuclear deformation which takes place\nbetween N = 58 and N = 60 and is rather sudden in the Sr\nand Zr isotopes and more gradual in the Mo isotopes. For the\nnuclei closer to N = 50, the structure is generally understood\nin terms of simple excitations across the subshell closures at\n50 and 56.\nThere are, however, some nuclei in this region which are\nrather poorly known at higher spins. The nuclei studied in this\nwork, 91Y and 95Nb, are two such examples. This situation\noccurs because they are rather close to the stability line and\ntherefore are not so readily populated in reactions that bring in\nsignificant angular momentum, such as the fusion-evaporation\nreaction. Consequently, for such studies one needs \u03b3 -ray\ncoincidence setups with high efficiency.\nThe 91Y nucleus has been studied before only in \u03b2 decay\n[1] and light-particle-induced transfer reactions: (t, p) [2],\n(d,3He) and (t, \u03b1) [3], and (p, \u03b1) [4]. Thus, only relatively\nlow-spin states are known in this nucleus (see the adopted\nlevel scheme in Ref. [5]). Similarly, the structure of 95Nb is\nknown only from studies of \u03b2 decay [6] and reactions with\nlight projectiles: (p, p\u2032) [7], (3He, d), and (\u03b1, t) [8]; (t, \u03b1) [9],\nand (d, \u03b1) [10] (see also the adopted level scheme in Ref. [11]).\nIn the present work, we show new results on the high-\nspin states of the 91Y52 and 95Nb54 nuclei, thus enriching\nthe systematics of the nuclear structure evolution along the\nN = 52 and N = 54 chains. A comparison between the\nexperimental results and shell-model calculations will be made\nfor both nuclei.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL\nA. Experiments with 12C and 16O beams\nHigh-spin states in the 91Y and 95Nb nuclei have been\npopulated in fusion-evaporation reactions. The first series of\nexperiments were performed at the Bucharest FN tandem\naccelerator. The beams were 12C at 38 MeV and 16O at 48 MeV,\nwith currents typically around 10 particle nA. The target was\nin both cases a \u223c3-mg\/cm2 selenium (enriched 92% in 82Se),\nvacuum evaporated onto a 2-mg\/cm2 Au foil.\nThe \u03b3 rays were detected with three \u223c20% efficiency HPGe\ndetectors, placed at 45\u25e6, 135\u25e6, and 270\u25e6 with respect to the\nbeam direction, and one planar Ge detector placed in the\nsame plane at 215\u25e6. The charged particles from the reaction\nwere detected with a \u0004E-E telescope with silicon detectors\nof thicknesses of 0.15 and 0.5 mm and an active surface of\n150 mm2. The telescope was mounted at 60\u25e6 in the forward\ndirection, at a distance of 2.5 cm from the target, and was\nscreened against the scattered heavy ions with a 70-\u00b5m-thick\nAl foil. Neutrons were detected with a 1 litre NE213 scintillator\ndetector placed in the forward direction, shielded with 2.5 cm\nof lead and covering \u00b128\u25e6; the neutron-\u03b3 discrimination was\nmade by pulse-shape analysis. Coincidences between all these\ndetectors were registered on the hard disk of a PC and then\nanalyzed off-line by generating \u03b3 -ray spectra coincident with\nneutrons, protons, and \u03b1 particles, as well as \u03b3 -\u03b3 coincidence\n0556-2813\/2005\/71(3)\/034315(9)\/$23.00 034315-1 \u00a92005 The American Physical Society\nD.

About 5\u00d7107 events were registered in each of these\nexperiments. \u03b3 -ray energy and efficiency calibrations were\nmade with a 152Eu source.\nThese experiments had as their main purpose the assign-\nment of new \u03b3 -ray transitions to the positive-parity yrast lines\nof the two nuclei (see below).\nB. Experiment with 82Se beam\nThe lowest-lying few transitions in the yrast bands of\n91Y and 95Nb, as determined from the experiments described\nabove, were used as starting points to extend the level scheme\nby working on data from an experiment performed with\nthe GASP array. This was a multinucleon transfer reaction\nexperiment made with a 82Se beam on a 192Os target, aimed at\nobtaining new information on the level schemes of W and Os\ntargetlike nuclei and Ge beamlike nuclei [12]. The 82Se beam\nhad an energy of 470 MeV and current of about 1 particle\nnA and was accelerated by the XTU Tandem and ALPI Linac\naccelerators from Legnaro. The target was 50 mg\/cm2 thick,\non a 0.2-mm Ta foil. The nuclei of interest for the present\nwork were populated in the fusion-evaporation reactions of\nthe Se beam with 16O and, possibly, 12C contaminants of the\ntarget. Calculations with the statistical model code CASCADE\nshow that at 470-MeV energy of the 82Se beam, and lower\nenergies due to its fast slowing down in the Os target, the\nreactions on 16O appreciably populate a wide range of nuclei:\n94Mo(4n channel), 95\u221292Nb ( pxn), 93\u221290Zr (\u03b1xn), 91\u221289Y\n(\u03b1pxn). The observed relative intensities of the different\nchannels are difficult to compare more than qualitatively\nwith the calculations, because of the unknown distribution of\noxygen in the target, but they suggest an in-depth oxidization\nof the target: the comparable intensities observed for 95Nb\n5000\n10000\n15000\n20000\n0\n100\n200\nCo\nun\nts\n400 600 800 1000 1200 1400\nE\u03b3   (keV)\n500\n1000\n67\n2\n92\n9\n33\n4\n61\n9\n*\n#\n#\n#\n#\n#\n##\n*\n12C (38 MeV) + 82Se\n*\n87Y\nSingles\nCoincidence with neutrons\nCoincidence with protons\n*\n*\n*\n90Y\n&\n&\n&\n91Zr\n90Zr\n13\n71\n#\n*\n#\n#\n89,92Zr\n* FIG. 2.

Examples of triple \u03b3 -ray coin-\ncidences illustrating the level schemes pre-\nsented in Figs. 4 (upper spectrum) and 5\n(lower spectrum). The displayed spectra were\nobtained in the reactions of the 82Se beam\nwith oxygen, and possibly with carbon con-\ntaminants of the Os target, by double gating\non a symmetric cube; they are a sum of\nthe coincidences between any two \u03b3 -ray\ntransitions specified in the shown groups.\n(the p2n channel) and 91Y (\u03b1p2n) could be explained by their\ncross sections integrated over the range 470 to about 200 MeV\n(reached by the incident beam after traveling \u223c15 mg\/cm2 in\nthe target). On the other hand, some contribution to the 91Y\nproduction may come also from the reaction of the 82Se beam\nwith a 12C contaminant, as shown by the production of some Sr\nisotopes (\u03b1xn channels), but it is expected that this contribution\nis less important than that of the reaction on oxygen, since the\ncarbon impurity can only be imagined as being due to a thin\nlayer of, e.g., vacuum oil, at the surface of the target.\nIn this experiment, the \u03b3 rays were detected with the GASP\narray [13] in a configuration with 40 HPGe detectors and\n74 BGO detectors as a multiplicity filter (6 of the 80 BGO\nelements of GASP were replaced by neutron detectors at the\ntime of the experiment). The events registered on tape had\nas their trigger the condition that at least three Ge detectors\nand two BGO\u2019s were in coincidence. In the off-line pro-\ncessing of the data, two- and three-dimensional symmetrized\n\u03b3 -coincident matrices were constructed, as well as different\nnonsymmetric matrices. Thus, in order to obtain angular\ndistribution (ADO) information, \u03b3 -\u03b3 matrices were made, in\nwhich the energy signals from all detectors were registered on\none axis, and those from each specific ring of detectors were\nput on the other axis. By gating on the all-detector axis, the\nresulting spectra have the ADO information independent of the\ngating transition(s). Another type of nonsymmetric \u03b3 -\u03b3 matrix\nwas also made, with the 90\u25e6 detector ring on one axis, and the\n34\u25e6 and 146\u25e6 rings on the other axis; this matrix was used to\ndetermine directional correlation orientation (DCO) ratios for\nthe assignment of multipolarities to the \u03b3 -ray transitions.\nIII. RESULTS\nFigures 1 and 2 illustrate the results obtained in the experi-\nments with the light-ion beams. Figure 1 shows \u03b3 -ray spectra\nfrom the 82Se + 16O (48 MeV) reaction, recorded in the singles\nmode as well as in coincidence with neutrons and protons. The\nspectrum in coincidence with protons shows, besides weak\nlines of 93Nb [14] (from the target contamination with 80Se),\nthree unknown \u03b3 rays at 824.7, 679.0, and 869.9 keV.

PHYSICAL REVIEW C 71, 034315 (2005)\nlines are not seen in coincidence with \u03b1 particles. They cannot\nbelong to a channel with three evaporated protons\u2014statistical\nmodel calculations with the CASCADE code predict negligible\ncross sections for such channels. Other channels with two\nevaporated protons are also predicted with very small cross\nsections, and in fact, none of the known \u03b3 rays of 95Zr [15]\n(the 2pn channel) have been observed. The 824.7 keV line is\nalso clearly seen in coincidence with the neutrons; the other\ntwo lines in the neutron-coincident spectrum are difficult to\ndistinguish due to their proximity to lines of close energy\nfrom the much stronger, dominating channels 4n (94Mo) and\n3n (95Mo) [16]. For the strongest \u03b3 ray of 824.7 keV, the\nneutron multiplicity of the channel has been determined from\nthe ratio of its intensity in coincidence with the neutrons\nand in the singles spectrum (normalized with channels with\nknown neutron multiplicity) as 2.1 \u00b1 0.9. Although it has\na large statistical error caused by the low cross section of\nthe channel, this value indicates as very likely a channel\nwith two evaporated neutrons. Considering all the possibilities\ndiscussed above, we have finally assigned these \u03b3 rays to\nthe p2n channel (95Nb). The cross section of this channel,\nestimated relative to that of the strong xn channels such as\n94Mo and 95Mo [16] which are well predicted by the CASCADE\ncalculations, is about 5 mb (ca. 2.5% of the total fusion cross\nsection). Gating on the symmetric \u03b3 -\u03b3 matrix revealed that\nthe 824.7-keV transition is coincident with itself and therefore\nis a doublet, and that the four \u03b3 rays form a cascade. Since it\nis the strongest sequence populated in the fusion-evaporation\nreaction, this cascade of four transitions has been assigned to\nthe positive-parity yrast band built on the 9\/2+ ground state of\n95Nb. The small cross section of this channel combined with\nthe reduced \u03b3 -ray detection efficiency of our setup (in the\noxygen-beam experiment) did not allow a clear assignment\nof other transitions. Because of the weak statistical level, the\nmultipolarity of these \u03b3 rays could not be assigned but was\ntentatively proposed on the basis of the systematic of this g9\/2\nstructure in the region (see below).\nIn a similar way, we have assigned a cascade of three\ntransitions to 91Y, namely 929.5, 672.0, and 1370.6 keV, from\nthe study of the reaction 82Se + 12C (38 MeV). Figure 2\nshows the singles, neutron-coincident, and proton-coincident\nspectra for this reaction, similar to those in Fig. 1. This\ncascade has been assigned to the positive-parity quadrupole\nsequence built above the known 9\/2+ isomer (half-life 49.7\nmin) at Ex = 555.6 keV [5]. This structure was populated\nwith an intensity of less than 3% of the total fusion cross\nsection.\nThe cascades assigned to the two nuclei have been con-\nfirmed, and the level schemes have been further extended by\nanalysis of the data collected in the GASP experiment (82Se\nbeam, on the oxygen and, possibly, carbon contaminants of the\n192Os target). The level schemes have been constructed on the\nbasis of the observed coincidence and intensity relationships\nof the \u03b3 -ray transitions. Most of the coincidences have been\nobserved clearly by double-gating on the symmetric \u03b3 -\u03b3 -\u03b3\ncube.\nFigure 3 shows some examples of the observed coinci-\ndences in the two reactions, which illustrate the level schemes\n9\/2 0.0\n(13\/2 ) 824.7\n(17\/2 ) 1649.4\n(21\/2 ) 2328.4\n(25\/2 ) 3198.3\n(29\/2 ) 4070.9\n(33\/2 ) 5140.0\n5643.4\n6487.7\n7493.3\n8695.2\n(21\/2 ) 2522.0\n824.7\n824.7\n679.0\n869.9\n1069.1\n872.6\n503.4\n1005.6\n844.3\n1201.9\n872.6\n676.2\nNb95\nFIG. 5.

In our case the DCO ratio obtained from a gate on a\nstretched \u0004J = 2 transition should be \u223c1.0 for a stretched\nquadrupole transition and \u223c0.5 for a stretched \u0004J = 1\ntransition.\nAlternatively, ADO ratios, defined as the ratio of the\nintensities of a transition as observed in the rings of detectors\nat 34\u25e6 + 146\u25e6 and at 90\u25e6, have been determined; the expected\nvalues are \u223c1.3 for pure quadrupole transitions and \u223c0.7 for\npure dipole transitions.\nTable I gives the values determined for both the ADO\nand the DCO ratios. The lowest transitions in the cascades\nof the two nuclei have been assigned as stretched quadrupoles,\non the basis of their ADO ratio (Table I). It was assumed\nthat they are of the E2 type, which also fits in the level\nscheme systematics of isotonic sequences (see below). DCO\nratios could then be determined starting from gates on these\ntransitions. Figure 6 shows the DCO ratio values determined\nfor the transitions assigned to the two nuclei, in comparison\nwith values determined for known quadrupole- and dipole-\ntype transitions from other nuclei strongly populated in our\nreactions. It can be seen that the most probable assignment\nfor our transitions is the quadrupole type. Thus, the tentative\nspin-parity assignments shown in Figs. 4 and 5 were made on\nthe basis of the DCO and ADO ratios, by assuming that the\nquadrupole transitions are of the E2 type.\nA special discussion is necessary in the case of 95Nb, in\nconnection with the ordering of some of the transitions within\nthe cascade. The 824.7-keV transition was placed as the lowest\nin the cascade because of the large intensity observed for this\nline. On the other hand, as remarked above, there is a second\n\u03b3 ray with the same energy somewhere in the cascade. The\nplace of this transition relative to the others has been deduced\nas follows. In a double gate on the \u03b3 -\u03b3 -\u03b3 coincidence cube,\non the 869.9- and 1069.1-keV lines, the 824.7-keV line has an\nintensity twice that of the 679-keV line; therefore, the three\ntransitions of 824.7, 824.7, and 679.0 keV must be placed be-\nlow the 869.9-keV transition. The 679.0-keV transition cannot\nbe placed in between the two 824.7-keV transitions because of\nthe observed 676.2-872.6-keV coincidence, which is an alter-\nnative path to the 869.9-679.0-keV sequence. Consequently,\nthe lowest four transitions in the cascade are proposed in the\norder 824.7, 824.7, 679.0, and 869.9 keV; the intensities of\nthe latter two transitions are determined with somewhat large\n034315-5\nD.

Above the 3198-keV level, there\nare two cases of uncertain ordering of pairs of \u03b3 rays, namely,\n872.6 and 1069.1 keV, and 503.4 and 844.3 keV; in both cases\nthe two \u03b3 rays have equal intensities within the statistical\nuncertainty (Table I). This is indicated in Fig. 5 by drawing the\nintermediate level by a dashed line. One should note, therefore,\nthat while the positions of the levels at 5140.0 and 6487.7 keV\nare unambiguously determined, those of the levels at 4070.9\nand 5643.4 keV could have resulted by swapping the positions\nof the two \u03b3 rays that feed and deexcite these levels.\nIV. DISCUSSION\nA. Level systematics\nFigure 7 shows the evolution of the lowest part of the\nassumed g9\/2 structure observed in 9139Y in comparison with that\nof other odd-A N = 52 nuclei and the ground-state quasiband\nof the even-even N = 52 nuclei. The structure assigned to 91Y\nis rather similar to that of the neighboring even-even isotone\n92Zr and, up to the 4+ state, to that of 90Sr (where the 6+1 state\nis higher, at 1839 keV above the 4+1 state). Thus, this structure\ncan be interpreted as a g9\/2 proton hole weakly coupled to\nthe 0+, 2+, 4+, and 6+ states of the even-even 92Zr core.\nSimilarly, Fig. 8 shows the evolution of the same structure\nalong the N = 54 chain. This systematic shows that the first\ntwo yrast transitions of 95Nb follow smoothly the trend given\nby the closest N = 54 neighbors (96Mo, 97Tc).\nB.

The residual interaction con-\ntains a combination of calculated and empirical two-body\nmatrix elements (TBME) which is described in the code. The\noriginal TBME are based on the bare G-matrix calculations\nof Ref. [18]. The TBME for the proton orbitals are replaced\nby the effective values of Ji and Wildenthal [19]. The TBME\nwhich connect the proton 2p1\/2, 1g9\/2 orbitals with the neutron\n2d5\/2, 3s1\/2 orbitals are replaced with those determined by\nGloeckner [20], and those between the proton 2p1\/2, 1g9\/2\norbitals with the neutron 2p1\/2, 1g9\/2 orbitals are replaced\nwith those of Serduke et al. [21]. In our calculations for\n95Nb, we assumed that 8838Sr50 is an inert core, so that the\nproton 1f5\/2 and 2p3\/2 orbitals and the neutron 1g9\/2 and\n2p1\/2 orbitals were kept fully occupied, while in the case of\n91Y we relaxed this condition for the proton orbitals allowing\n1p-1h and 2p-2h excitations across the Z = 38 shell closure.\nThe single-particle energies corresponding to our valence\nspace were 0.82, 2.20, and 4.89 MeV, respectively, for the\nproton 1f5\/2, 2p1\/2, and 1g9\/2 orbitals (relative to the value\nof the 2p3\/2 orbital). For neutron 1g7\/2, 3s1\/2, 2d3\/2 orbitals,\nwe used the single-particle energy values of 3.33, \u22120.39,\nand 1.73 MeV (relative to the value for the 2d5\/2 orbital),\nrespectively. These values have been chosen in the following\nway. Since the proton-proton interaction for the 1f5\/2, 2p1\/2,\nand 1g9\/2 orbitals is the one empirically determined by Ji\nand Wildenthal [19] to describe many nuclei with Z\u0001 32 and\nN = 50, the single-particle energies of proton orbitals used in\nour calculations were renormalized in such a way that by taking\ninto account the additional proton-neutron interaction between\nthe 1f5\/2, 2p3\/2, 2p1\/2, and 1g9\/2 protons and the 2p1\/2 and\n1g9\/2 neutrons, the calculations still reproduce the results of\nJi and Wildenthal, who did not consider the proton-neutron\ninteraction explicitly.

For the neutron 2d5\/2, 1g7\/2, 3s1\/2, and 2d3\/2 orbitals,\nthe single-particle energy values were chosen to obtain a\ngood description of the low-energy spectra in 93Mo, 91Zr,\nand 89Sr.\nFigure 9 shows the comparison of the experimental\nspectrum of 95Nb with the results of these calculations. A\nreasonably good agreement has been obtained for yrast states\nwith spin up to 25\/2. The higher-spin states are predicted to lie\nmuch higher in energy than observed experimentally. Table II\nshows the particle occupation of the orbitals included in the\ncalculations. It can be observed in Table II that the calculated\nstates with spin above 25\/2 require the excitation of one proton\npair from the 2p1\/2 to the 1g9\/2 orbital, as well as the promotion\nof one neutron from the 2d5\/2 to the 3s1\/2 orbital. Clearly,\nan enlargement of our basis space by including the 1h11\/2\nintruder orbital and allowing the competition of many other\nconfigurations (particle-hole excitations across Z = 38 and\nN = 50) will increase the collectivity and lower the energy of\nthese states, as required by the experiment.\nTo calculate the 91Y nucleus, we allowed at most two holes\nin the 1f5\/2 and 2p3\/2 proton orbitals. The comparison between\nthe experimental level scheme and the predicted one is shown\nin Fig. 10, and selected wavefunctions are given in Table II.\nThe positive-parity yrast states are well described up to spin\nparity 21\/2+. For the experimental levels placed above this\nstate (see Fig. 3), unambiguous spin-parity assignments were\n034315-8\nHIGH-SPIN STATES IN THE NUCLEI 91Y AND 95Nb PHYSICAL REVIEW C 71, 034315 (2005)\nnot possible, and they cannot be precisely associated with\ncalculated states. They most likely correspond to some of the\n17\/2+, 19\/2+, or 21\/2+ states predicted by our calculations\nin their energy region (see Fig. 10). Higher-spin levels are\npredicted at high energies. For example, the 25\/2+ state is\npredicted above 6 MeV in our calculations since it can be built\nonly by promoting at least one proton across the Z = 38 shell\ngap (from the 1f5\/2 or 2p3\/2 orbitals into the 2p1\/2 orbital), as\ncan be seen from the orbital occupancies given in Table II. As\nin the case of 95Nb, a shell-model space extended to include the\nneutron 1h11\/2 orbital and a more relaxed truncation scheme\nshould be considered for a good description of higher-spin\nstates in 91Y.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nThe positive-parity yrast states of the nuclei 91Y and 95Nb\nhave been assigned in experiments utilizing heavy-ion fusion-\nevaporation reactions. Shell-model calculations have been\nperformed for both nuclei with the OXBASH shell-model code\nusing the configuration space (\u03c0f5\/2, \u03c0p3\/2, \u03c0p1\/2, \u03c0g9\/2,\n\u03bdp1\/2, \u03bdg9\/2, \u03bdd5\/2, \u03bdg7\/2, \u03bds1\/2, \u03bdd3\/2). For 95Nb, an inert 88Sr\ncore has been considered; while in the case of 91Y, up to two\nholes in the proton f5\/2 and p3\/2 orbitals were allowed. These\ncalculations describe reasonably well the level schemes up to\nthe 25\/2+ state in 95Nb and the 21\/2+ state in 91Y. To describe\nstates of higher spin, an enlargement of the configuration space\nis needed.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe acknowledge support received within the\nEuropean Contract No. HPRI-CT-1999-00083\u2013V Frame-\nwork Programme.
