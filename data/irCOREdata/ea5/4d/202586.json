Dialogue . . . must not be \na situation where some men name on behalf of others.\u2019 \n   Paulo Freire, Pedagogy of the Oppressed (1972, 61-62) \n  \n\u2018the real problem . . . is that people\u2019s questions are not answered by the existing \ndistribution of the educational curriculum.\u2019 \n  Raymond Williams, \u2018The future of cultural studies\u2019 (1989a: 160) \n \nIt is a platitude of educational reformers, on the right, the left and the old left which \nnow claims the mantle of the new centre, that we live in a fast-changing world and \neducation\u2019s duty is to prepare us for it. Less common is the insight that such \u2018change\u2019 \nis not definable apart from conflicts of value and therefore power, which a genuinely \ndemocratic practice of education must address. Education should not be reduced to \ntraining people to accommodate to other people\u2019s definitions of change; it must in \nPaulo Freire\u2019s sense be a dialogue. But it is precisely this vision of education that is \ncurrently under threat.  \n \n 2\nYou can risk the whole authority of academic practice on the idea that it transcends \nquestions of value. That was Max Weber\u2019s (1991 [1921]) vision of sociology for a \nworld which he saw as riven by irreconcilable conflicts of value; to mix science with \nvalues or politics was to fall into \u2018prophecy\u2019 or \u2018demagoguery\u2019. Given the \ncompromised racial politics of academic life in Germany in the early twentieth \ncentury, we cannot dismiss Weber\u2019s vision lightly. Alternatively, you can base a \nsubject on the belief that at certain times it is precisely commitments of value that \nacademics need to make, clearly and unequivocally. It is this \u2018political\u2019 conception of \neducation and intellectual work that has characterised cultural studies. In this article, I \nwant to do two things: to explore what the underlying values of cultural studies are, \nand to illustrate why they matter particularly in the current state of educational \npolitics, in Britain and perhaps elsewhere.  \n  \nIn exploring the distinctive values of cultural studies, a useful reference-point remains \nthe vision of Raymond Williams, developed in Britain principally in the 1950s and \n1960s. The position is complicated, because, since Williams\u2019 early writings, all \nquestions of value in intellectual work have undergone a fundamental displacement: a \ndecentreing of the very basis on which intellectual and scientific authority is claimed \nor assumed. What was primarily a conversation within the ambit of \u2018the West\u2019 and \nwithin a largely unquestioned patriarchal and racially specific authority must now be a \nconversation that is decentred, open-ended, and global. And yet a fundamental \nprinciple that Williams articulated was dialogue and an interrogation of power\u2019s \ninvestments in cultural value. So we need, not to jettison Williams\u2019 work, but to \nisolate its key principles and explore how they resonate with work done in other \nplaces and times. It was in a similar spirit, I believe, that Edward Said (1978: 28) in \n 3\none of the most devastating attacks on the intellectual authority of \u2018the West\u2019 \nacknowledged Williams\u2019 (1961) vision of transcending the \u2018long dominative mode\u2019 of \nthinking about culture.  \n \nWhatever its limitations, Williams\u2019 work kept worrying away at an essential but \ndeceptively simple question: why does it matter that we study \u2018our\u2019 culture, \u2018ordinary\u2019 \nculture (Williams, 1989b) and how best can we do it within an institutional \nframework? This breaks down into a number of specific questions:  \n \n\u2022 What are the values embedded in, or excluded from, the cultural spaces in which I \nhave been formed?  \n\u2022 To what extent can I call those embedded values my own, and to what extent \nshould I be critical of them?  \n\u2022 Is that space a democratic one? If not, why not, and what might make it \ndemocratic? \n\u2022 what are the conditions of a \u2018common culture\u2019 (Williams, 1958: 305) and what \nvalues underpin them? \n \nThese are, by definition, public questions, part of a wider dialogue. Putting them at \nthe heart of the academic study of culture is the starting-point of cultural studies as a \ndiscipline. Unfortunately, for us as for Williams, this orientation puts cultural studies \nat odds with the prevailing educational logics of the day.  \n \nIn the first section, I will explore what Williams meant by the \u2018ordinariness\u2019 of \nculture, and show the parallels with approaches to culture developed elsewhere: in \n 4\nKenya (the work of Ngugi wa Thiong\u2019o) and in Colombia (the work of Jesus Martin-\nBarbero). In the second section I discuss some of the limitations of Williams\u2019 vision \nand how it must be transposed, if it is to remain a useful reference-point for \ncontemporary cultural politics. This transposition is all the more vital, I argue in the \nthird section, given the threat to educational dialogue from its reduction to commerce; \nas an example, I discuss the inadequate concept of education of even a relatively \nsympathetic institutional reformer, Charles Leadbeater, a leading adviser to Tony \nBlair\u2019s New Labour government in Britain.   \n \nI then attempt to draw together the principles common to various visions of cultural \nstudies, before reflecting in the conclusion on the connections between such abstract \nprinciples and practical pedagogy and citizenship.   \n \nThe Ordinariness of Culture \n \n\u2018Culture is ordinary\u2019, Raymond Williams famously wrote. His point was not to \nreplace a notion of culture (as specific, legitimated works) with a looser notion of \nculture as life process, but to hold both notions of culture in tension. Instead of seeing \nthe artistic work (such as the nineteenth century English novel) in the abstract, \nWilliams insisted on thinking about how it emerged from a much broader range of \ncultural practice, what he called a \u2018cultural formation\u2019, a shared practice of making \nmeanings involving everyone in a particular culture. \n \nThese connections are brought out in the following passage from an essay originally \npublished in 1958: \n 5\n \nCulture is ordinary: that is the first fact. Every human society has its own shape, its \nown purposes, its own meanings. Every human society expressed these, in \ninstitutions, and in arts and learning. The making of a society is the finding of \ncommon meanings and directions . . . The growing society is there, yet it is also \nmade and remade in every individual mind. . . . A culture has two aspects: the \nknown meanings and directions, which its members are trained to; the new \nobservances and meanings, which are offered and tested. These are the ordinary \nprocesses of human societies and human minds, and we see through them the \nnature of a culture: that is always both traditional and creative; that it is both the \nmost ordinary common meanings and the finest individual meanings. We use the \nword culture in these two senses: to mean a whole way of life \u2013 the common \nmeanings; to mean the arts and leaning \u2013 the special processes of discovery and \ncreative effort. Some writers reserve the word for one or other of these senses; I \ninsist on both, and on the significance of their conjunction. The questions I ask \nabout our culture are questions about our general and common purposes, yet also \nquestions about deep personal meanings. Culture is ordinary, in every society and \nin every mind. (1989b: 4, added emphasis)  \n \nI have quoted this at length because it shows the direction of Williams\u2019 argument, and \nits originality, very clearly. As the highlighted passage brings out, it is the complex \ninterrelation of \u2018textual\u2019 and \u2018anthropological\u2019 approaches to culture that was \nimportant to him.  \n \n 6\nThis had two major advantages: it avoided abstracting cultural analysis from an \nanalysis of the shared living conditions of that culture\u2019s time; and it introduced a \nnecessary distance from the value judgements about cultural production (present and \nhistorical) which happen to prevail at any particular time. The second advantage is \nthat cultural analysis (as so conceived) apply just as appropriately to any work, \nwhether \u2018high\u2019 or \u2018low\u2019: there is no question of \u2018high\u2019 culture being more worth \ninvestigating from this point of view. As Williams once put it: \u2018our real purpose \nshould be to bring all cultural work within the same world of discourse\u2019 (1968: 133).  \n \nIt is easy to take this latter point for granted given four decades of cultural studies \npractice, so it is worth remembering how different Williams\u2019 vision was from \nconventional analyses of culture at that time. The distinguished American sociologist, \nEdward Shils, for example, commented in 1961, as if it were plain fact, that: \n \n[there are] three levels of culture, which are levels of quality measured by \naesthetic, intellectual and moral standards. These are \u2018superior\u2019 or \u2018refined\u2019 culture, \n\u2018mediocre\u2019 culture, and \u2018brutal culture\u2019. (1961: 4, quoted in Tudor, 1995: 88-9)  \n \nCan we really deny that a similar division is at work even now in the structuring of \nhigher education and in press attacks (very common in Britain at least) on the status \nof media and cultural studies? Raymond Williams\u2019 point remains a radical one. \n \nIt is worth spelling out some further implications. The first is that Williams is not \nsimply arguing that we pay more attention to \u2018popular\u2019 culture at the expense of elite \nculture. To do that would simply invert the high\/low hierarchy without challenging it.  \n 7\nInstead Williams is arguing for a common culture: a shared culture based on what he \ncalls a \u2018recognition of practical equality\u2019 between its members (1958: 305). Putting \nthat into practice means a lot more than just avoiding judgements about cultural \nproduction you don\u2019t like much. It means positively valuing everyone\u2019s common \nexperience in a shared culture, treating everyone\u2019s experience of culture as valuable \n(1958: 306). It was this sense of valuing each other that was missing, according to \nWilliams, in 1950s Britain: \n \nan effective community of experience . . . depends on a recognition of practical \nequality . . . We lack a genuinely common experience, save in certain rare and \ndangerous moments of crisis. What we are paying for this lack . . . is now \nsufficiently evident. We need a common culture, not for the sake of an abstraction, \nbut because we shall not survive without it.  \n(1958: 304) \n \nAt the level of understanding how culture works, that meant seeing \u2018communication\u2019 \nin a much broader way than conventional literary studies allowed, and connecting \nwith broader debates about democracy.   \n \nIn The Long Revolution (1961), Williams argued that  everyone, in making sense of \nthe world, is an active producer of meanings, a creative interpreter (1961: ch. 1). From \nthis he drew an important conclusion: \n \n 8\nIf man is essentially a learning, creating, communicating being, the only social \norganization adequate to his nature is a participating democracy in which all of us, \nas unique individuals, learn, communicate and control.  \n(1961: 118, added emphasis) \n \nBut 1950s Britain \u2013 and Williams was very clear on this \u2013 was not a democracy in this \nsense (1961: 339). Reversing this was what Williams meant by \u2018the long revolution\u2019: \n\u2018a cultural revolution [which] extend[ed] the active process of learning, with the skills \nof literary and other advanced communication, to all people rather than to limited \ngroups\u2019 (1961: 11). Williams was writing when the hopes for the transformative \npotential of television were still fresh, but the question remains a live one today, as we \naddress fears of a digital divide and debate even the desirability of a shared culture.  \n \nIt would be a mistake, however, to see Williams\u2019 work as the production of a \u2018lone \ngenius\u2019. One little-known part of its context is the long history of adult education in \nBritain since the late 19th century, partly under the auspices of established universities \nsuch as Oxford. The judgement of one historian of the Workers\u2019 Educational \nAssociation for whom Williams taught from 1946 to 1961 is interesting: \n \nWe should be sceptical of portraits of Williams in the 1950s as isolated and \nunassociated with mainstream academic life. . . . Put simply, Williams\u2019 work in \n[the 1950s] drew on the adult [education] tradition, especially as it had been \ndeveloped in Oxford since the late nineteenth century, and may be said to have \npresented this intellectual lineage and way of understanding society to a large and \nreceptive audience . . .  \n 9\n(Goldman, 1995: 291-2) \n \nThe vision of culture as \u2018ordinary\u2019 was the result of a sustained social debate and \nteaching practice in Britain lasting more than half a century. I return to this point in \nmy conclusion. \n \nThere are also striking parallels between Williams\u2019 cultural theory and work \ndeveloped outside Britain and in very different circumstances. Ngugi wa Thiong\u2019o\u2019s \nbook Decolonising the Mind (1986) develops a rich concept of culture, which itself \ngrew out of debates in Kenya in the 1960s and 1970s about how literature should be \ntaught in the post-colonial era. Just as Williams\u2019 work responded to Britain\u2019s \n\u2018expanding culture\u2019 (1958: 12), so too Ngugi\u2019s work can be seen as a response to a \ntime of change, even crisis. Ironically, the crisis from which the Kenyan debate \nresulted arose from the imposition in Kenyan schools after World War II of precisely \nthe English canon of literature whose influence Williams in a very different way was \nnegotiating in Britain a decade or so before. It is, then, perhaps not surprising that \nNgugi was aware of Raymond Williams\u2019 work early on (Ngugi, 1986: 90), but tracing \n\u2018influences\u2019 from Britain is definitely not the point. For Ngugi\u2019s conception of culture \ndeveloped precisely as resistance to the imposition of British culture from the outside. \nNonetheless there are interesting parallels.  \n \nLike Williams, Ngugi draws on Marx\u2019s analysis in The German Ideology (1977) of \nhow language and culture are formed in the course of the practices of everyday \nmaterial life.1 Ngugi develops a rich notion of language as both direct means of \n 10\ncommunication and as the carrier of a distinctive culture (1986: 15). Culture is to be \nseen as part of a complex lived process: \n \nThere is a gradual accumulation of values which in time become almost self-\nevident truths . . . Over a time this becomes a way of life distinguishable from \nother ways of life . . . Values are the basis of a people\u2019s identity, their sense of \nparticularity as members of the human race. All this is carried by language. \nLanguage as culture is the collective memory bank of a people\u2019s experience in \nhistory.  \n(Ngugi, 1986: 14-15)  \n \nThese values are reflected both in a way of life and in specific works, whether of the \noral or written traditions. Ngugi\u2019s notion of culture was specifically an attempt to \nthink about his own language and culture (Gikuyu) that the British had set out to \ndestroy by imposing an English-language based education system and literary culture \n(1986: 11-13). This was what Ngugi famously called the \u2018cultural bomb\u2019 which: \n \nannihilates a people\u2019s belief in their names, in their languages, in their \nenvironment, in their heritage of struggle, in their unity, in their capacities and \nultimately in themselves. It makes them see their past as one wasteland of non-\nachievement and it makes them want to identify with that which is furthest \nremoved from themselves . . .  \n(1986:  3) \n \n 11\nArticulating the grounds of a common culture was, for Ngugi (1986: 103) as for \nWilliams, a matter of democracy, but in conditions - of conflict with a dominant \noutside culture - very different from those Williams envisaged.  \n \nAnother interesting parallel for the notion of culture as \u2018ordinary\u2019 is Latin American \nwork on popular culture, for example that of the Colombian media theorist Jesus \nMartin-Barbero (1993). Here the context is not, as with Ngugi, the early stages of a \npost-colonial regime, but rather the long-term consequences of the Spanish Conquest: \nthe complex process of forging national unity in Latin American nations which are \ncomplex amalgams of indigenous, European, and mixed (mestizaje) populations, with \nenormous variations of literacy and material wealth (Rowe and Schelling, 1990).  \n \nLike Ngugi, Martin-Barbero is well aware of the work of British cultural studies along \nwith many other sources for studying the popular (history, anthropology, sociology), \nbut, again, to trace a British \u2018origin\u2019 for his work is misleading. What matters is that \nin the particular Latin American postcolonial context a broad notion of popular \nculture, parallel to Williams\u2019 concept of \u2018common culture\u2019, was necessary. As Martin-\nBarbero explains:  \n \nWe are not dealing with an increase of information about popular culture in terms \nof statistics and factual data, but rather with a process that relocates the \u2018place\u2019 of \nthe popular by incorporating it into the constitutive memory of the flow of history  \n. . . this has begun to fragment the once monolithic concept of culture both at the \nlevel of the semantic universe and at the pragmatic level.  \n(Martin-Barbero, 1993: 62) \n 12\n \nInstead of a limited range of texts, culture had to be seen as a mass of social processes \noperating at many levels, in all its \u2018ordinary\u2019 local complexity.  \n \nExtending the Values of Cultural Studies \n \nParallels are important \u2013 they show that cultural studies can be seen as a coherent, but \nde-centred subject, not one whose narratives must retrace a Eurocentric, colonial \ntrajectory (Wright, 1998) - but they are not enough. A radical transposition of the \nterms of Williams\u2019 vision is necessary, if we are to address today\u2019s cultural politics.  \n \nThe limitations of Williams\u2019 work have frequently been noted. First, its reference-\npoints in a sense of purely local practice, inspired by the Welsh working-class \ncommunity of his youth which, even when he wrote, was largely a nostalgic vision,2 \nand quite inadequate to the actual cultural complexity of 1950s Britain (Gilroy, 1987: \n49-50), let alone the implications of Britain\u2019s colonial past (Said, 1990: 83). To be \nfair, Williams\u2019 notion of social identity and community was not completely closed, \nsince he emphasised the need to convert a defensive solidarity into an acceptance of \n\u2018extending community\u2019 (1958: 319). But this extension of community was imagined \nby Williams largely in terms of class; the conflictual terrain of ethnicity was not \nintegrated into his thinking.  \n \nAnother limitation is, as Williams later admitted (1979: 148-9), that his notion of \ncommunity and of culture did not recognise gender inequalities, and how these are \n 13\nstructured into the very organisation of cultural production. The need to correct for \nthis is now so obvious that I will not discuss it further here.  \n \nThirdly, if the strength and clarity of Williams\u2019 vision derives in part from a closure - \naround a particular historical ideal of community -  it thereby ignores the problems \nassociated with cultural \u2018closure\u2019 itself. In the massive complexity of the late 20th and \nearly 21st centuries, there are powerful arguments to be made (see especially \nHaraway, 1991) against closure, whether around a notion of culture that is ethnically \nor geographically exclusive, or around forms of intellectual authority that rely on \nhidden exclusions (the centuries-long association of the intellectual voice with the \nmale voice), or even around a notion of \u2018humanity\u2019 (which may now need to be \nreevaluated in the light of our relationships with machines). Haraway\u2019s vision of a \ncommitted partiality may, in some respects, be a more helpful guide to a world where \nany debate must start out from difference and from complexity. The contrast, \nhowever, between Haraway and Williams should not be too sharply drawn. Just as \nWilliams at the end of the 1950s called for full literacy and full participation in \ncultural production as a response to changing times, so too Haraway is concerned with \nexpanding literacy in the broadest sense: for example, the need to expand critical \nknowledge about the cultural claims made on behalf of science. For both, cultural \nstudies is a crucial tool in avoiding a two-tier knowledge society. In a world, however, \nwhere the pressures to absorb education into commercial technoscience without \nremainder are so overwhelming, Haraway\u2019s vision of a \u2018politics\u2019 - a \u2018cyborg politics\u2019 \nas she originally called it - that \u2018struggle[s] for language and . . . against perfect \ncommunication, against the one code that translates all meaning perfectly\u2019 (1991: \n218) has a particular urgency. What may matter most are not claims of unity, but \n 14\nalliances across difference, communities of dialogue which are not simple or \u2018whole\u2019, \nbut are suspicious of universalising claims on behalf of science or technological \n\u2018destiny\u2019.  This is to transpose Williams\u2019 vision of dialogue onto a different, but not \nincompatible, register. \n \nWe need to make a similar transposition of Williams\u2019 values in relation to issues of \n\u2018race\u20193 and hybridity. Clearly Williams\u2019 concept of culture \u2013 focussed on lived \nexperience in particular locations \u2013 is inadequate to deal with cultures formed in \nmovement, in the course of disruptions of location, whether voluntary or involuntary. \nIt cannot, for example, help us understand the experience of the migrant workers who \nhave lived in the Mexico-US border region in the past two decades or so. As the \nArgentinian cultural theorist Nestor Garcia Canclini, who has worked a great deal on \nthe US-Mexican border region, argues, the challenge is to think about culture in the \nlight of \u2018the loss of the \u2018\u2018natural\u2019\u2019 relation of culture to geographical and social \nterritories\u2019 (1995: 229, added emphasis), exactly the natural relation that Williams \nseems to assume as his ideal. At the same time, this loss of connection may be cut \nacross by new patterns, new \u2018natural\u2019 relations, based on shared media experience, \nwhich reconfigure both private and public space. Canclini puts it as follows: \n \nCollective identities find their constitutive stage less and less in the city and in its \nhistory, whether distant or recent. . . . Almost all sociability, and reflection about it, \nis concentrated in intimate exchanges. Since . . . even the accidents that happened \nthe previous day in our own city reach us through the media, these become the \ndominant constituents of the \u2018public\u2019 meaning of the city . . . More than an \nabsolute substitution of urban life by the audiovisual media, I perceive a game of \n 15\nechoes. The commercial advertising and political slogans that we see on television \nare those that we reencounter in the streets, and vice versa: the ones are echoed in \nthe others. To this circularity of the communicational and the urban are \nsubordinated the testimonies of history and the public meaning constructed in \nlongtime [sic] experiences.  \n(Garcia Canclini, 1995: 210, 212, original emphasis)  \n \n\u2018Communication\u2019 in this context cannot now simply mean (as it did for Williams) \nsharing a historically continuous set of experiences tied to a separate location. The \nconnections between space, community, and culture have become too complex (cf \nCouldry, 2000, chapter 5) for such simple unities to be plausible, if they ever were.  \n \nThis is especially important when we think about cultures that have been formed in \nconflict (cf Hall, 1997). Contemporary black cultural critics in the USA address too a \nsense of cultural crisis, but one which does not admit of the affirmative solutions \nWilliams imagined. Cornel West has written controversially of \u2018nihilism\u2019 in black \ncommunities in America: \n \nnihilism not as a philosophical doctrine that there are no rational grounds for \nlegitimate standards or authority [but as] the lived experience of coping with a life \nof horrifying meaninglessness, hopelessness, and (most important) lovelessness.  \n(West, 1992: 40, added emphasis).  \n \nWhether or not he has Williams in mind, West\u2019s emphasis on \u2018lived experience\u2019 turns \nWilliams\u2019 arguments on their head. The lived experience in question is not one of \n 16\n\u2018settled\u2019 community, but one of facing daily the \u2018ontological wounds and emotional \nscars\u2019 of living in a culture marked by racism (1992: 42). This experience cannot \nsimply be \u2018affirmed\u2019. What is needed, West argues, is \u2018prophetic criticism\u2019: \n \na self-critical and self-corrective enterprise of human \u2018sense-making\u2019 for the \npreserving and expanding of human empathy and compassion.  \n(West, 1993: xi)  \n \nAt the very least, West argues, there must be a \u2018double conciousness\u2019, that is well \naware of the Euro-American intellectual tradition\u2019s implications in the material \nrealities of imperialism and slavery (1993: xi). Nor can there be any simple \naffirmation of the \u2018lived experience\u2019 of place, given the continuance of racism. \nInstead, what cultural studies must address is something more like the experience of \nexile in time and space, a \u2018homebound quest in an offbeat temporality\u2019 (1993:  xiii). \nSuch prophetic criticism is critical of the surrounding culture at a fundamental level, \nchallenging the very category of \u2018race\u2019 and asking how \u2018race\u2019 is embedded in \ndiscursive and cultural hierarchies (cf Gates, 1986; Gilroy, 2000). \n \nSuch criticism necessarily involves a complex self-critical relationship to collective \nexperience and culture. A recent essay by David Lionel Smith expresses this \npowerfully: \n \nwe [black cultural critics] must have the courage to risk alienating ourselves \nby challenging common sense, by being true critics and not mere celebrants of \nblack culture, and by subverting the premises that define blackness. . . .  \n 17\nWhat then is black culture? No one can answer these questions definitively, \nbecause \u2018black culture\u2019 is not a fixed, single thing \u2018out there\u2019 in the empirical \nworld. It is, rather, a complex and ambiguous set of processes and interactions, \nfacts, and fantasies, assertions and inquiries, passionately held and \npassionately contested  \n(Smith, 1997: 188, 192) \n \nThe \u2018necessity of creating a new culture\u2019 (Mercer, 1994: 3, quoting Gramsci) is a \ntheme which runs right through black cultural criticism in the USA, black British \ncultural studies, and postcolonial theory more widely. It is clear, then, that if we want \ncultural studies to go on addressing the (changing) conditions of \u2018common culture\u2019 - \nand if we do not, what useful continuity has cultural studies as a subject to offer? - \nthen we must transpose the terms in which Williams originally formulated the debate: \na common culture, not as the reproduction of \u2018the same\u2019, but as an open-ended \nencounter with difference, framed by a commitment to dialogue.  \n \nBefore formulating these values more fully \u2013 they lie at the heart of cultural studies \u2013 \nwe need to appreciate some of the political context which makes this project, for all \nits difficulties, so urgent.  \n \nEmpty Radicalism: Education Without Dialogue \n \nWhat the different inflections of cultural studies I have discussed all share is a sense \nthat education is more than the transmission of the already known. In a world where \ncultures are formed in conflict, and therefore shaped by existing imbalances of power, \n 18\neducation should provide a liminal space where the mutual influences of culture and \npower can be disentangled, and new perspectives on each generated. This is what \nPaulo Freire called \u2018dialogue\u2019: \u2018the encounter between men, mediated by the world, in \norder to name the world\u2019 (1972: 61). For this dialogue to occur, education needs \nspace, a regular sustained context. That space need not, of course, be identical to the \nactual spaces of educational institutions; it should certainly extend beyond them. At \npresent, however, the spaces for dialogue that exist within educational institutions are \nthreatened with enclosure by economically-driven ends. In this section, I want to \nshow how even a sympathetic would-be educational reformer (Charles Leadbeater in \nthe UK) is blind to this threat.  \n \nCharles Leadbeater is a former Financial Times and Independent journalist and writer \nfor the now defunct Marxism Today. As a researcher, he has played a leading role in \nthe think-tank Demos\u2019 close relationship with Tony Blair\u2019s New Labour, both before \nand after Blair\u2019s election victory. His book Living on Thin Air received considerable \nattention when first published in 1999. It was widely identified as a vision close to \nBlair himself; indeed it had Blair\u2019s endorsement on the dust-jacket. Its call for both \n\u2018an innovative and inclusive society\u2019 (2000: 11) was in some ways the justificatory \n\u2018bible\u2019 for which Blair\u2019s uneasy combination of globalizing and communitarian \nrhetoric had been waiting. Indeed, the attention it received partly reflected the fact \nthat until then it was precisely an articulated vision that Blair\u2019s politics lacked (Marr, \n1999). \n \nLeadbeater, in fact, is harsh on old-style communitarianism for its emphasis on the \nstability of local, lived community; instead, he advocates new forms of trust and \n 19\nsocial organization that can deal with accelerating global change and lives lived \nbeyond fixed locales. This is not a crude neoliberalism, since it does take seriously the \ncontributions which individuals make by working together both within formal \norganizations and beyond them, and many of its proposals for change (increasing \nemployees\u2019 stakes in their workplace, increasing local participation in politics) are \nwelcome. So too is his interest in issues of citizenship. Leadbeater\u2019s central idea is to \nencourage public sector \u2018entrepreneurship\u2019 whether within government, schools or the \nhealth service. In fact, Leadbeater shares with another critic of neoliberalism, Pierre \nBourdieu, the concern with \u2018reinventing public services\u2019 (Bourdieu, 1998: 27). What I \nwant to show, however, is that when, briefly, Leadbeater deals with education, his \npresumptions are incoherent, precisely because they fail to move beyond the \n\u2018autocratic technocracy\u2019 which Bourdieu insists we must challenge. Leadbeater, in \nother words, lacks any sense of education, except one prefigured by the economy and \nits power structures.  \n \nIf there were more space, I could connect this weakness with other weaknesses in \nLeadbeater\u2019s argument: his inadequate attention to the human costs of workplace \ninstability (Sennett, 1999), and his underplaying of the forces of concentration and \nconflict in the so-called \u2018knowledge economy\u2019, not least the inequalities of which \n\u2018knowledge workers\u2019 (including himself) are the principal beneficiaries. Yet while \npraising the innovation of California\u2019s Silicon Valley, he acknowledges its poor \npublic services and its heavy reliance on imported human capital (2000: 230, 236). \nThis leads him to a curious admission that \u2018[Silicon Valley\u2019s] model of society driven \nby specialist knowledge is increasingly at odds with a more democratic model of the \nknowledge society\u2019 (2000: 238). While Leadbeater seems to want such a model, he is \n 20\nprevented from developing one precisely because of his inadequate concept of how \neducation can contribute to democracy. It is on this specific weakness I want to \nconcentrate.  \n \nEven here, there are aspects of Leadbeater\u2019s treatment of education which are \nwelcome, for example his revival of Ivan Illich\u2019s (1971) idea of de-schooling society, \nthrough making the educational resources of the school available to the wider \ncommunity (2000: 112).  He extends this to a notion of continuous adult education, \nfrom which people can go on benefiting as their careers develop and change (or at \nleast \u2013 and the ageist detail is surely not accidental \u2013 \u2018throughout their twenties and \nthirties\u2019: 2000: 242). This, he argues, should be facilitated by distance learning and \nmodularisation of courses \u2013 again, perhaps, innocuous, if it were clear that this was  \nmerely designed to supplement existing educational access, rather than to replace the \nfull-time educational context that a conventional degree structure offers. But this is \nexactly what is unclear in his book: Leadbeater writes as he wants to replace older \nmore \u2018rigid\u2019 notions of higher education with a new, more \u2018flexible\u2019 model, whose \nprincipal benefit is that it is more closely tailored to economic conditions.  \n \nLeadbeater hardly discusses educational content at all, so we are left to assume that \nthe content which matters most in his scheme of things is that which most effectively \nservices the economy. Without ever being explicit, Leadbeater\u2019s book, by its absences \nmore than by its inclusions, reproduces a notion of education as mere training,4 as \n\u2018kit\u2019, in a currently fashionable English term, for economic performance. There is no \nplace at all for any broader notion of education\u2019s purpose, including its links with \ndemocratic debate.  \n 21\n \nThis reduced notion of education as training is increasingly common and frequently \nelided with a notion of \u2018liberated\u2019 consumerism. So, for example, the director of the \nEducation Counselling Service (an arm of the British Council) was recently quoted as \nsaying, without qualification, that \u2018education is becoming a consumer good, and \npeople will exercise the same kind of parameters in making their decisions as they do \nfor anything else\u2019; and a new report of the central policy making body in British \nhigher education (the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals) predicted a shift \nto a \u2018a customer-focussed approach to education and learning\u2019.5  Many academics \nhave enthusiastically embraced this new educational \u2018radicalism\u2019, for example the \nfeminist Dale Spender (2000) writing about online universities: \n \nThis is not the old distance learning, but online classroom interaction. Consumers \ncan choose when to start and when to stop. . . They can choose the tutors, the \ntopics, the terms. They are savvy purchasers who may want the learning so that \nthey can do the earning or they may buy the product simply for its pleasure or \nleisure value.      \n \nEven if education\u2019s effects cannot immediately be translated into economic activity, \nthe deferred economic benefit needs to be assured. So Umberto Eco, announcing the \nopening of his Scuola Superiore di Studi Umanistici in Bologna, anticipated students\u2019 \nand journalists\u2019 questions thus: \n \nWhat we say to our students in communication studies is, \u2018do not ask us what this \ndegree will be useful for \u2013 between the time you enrol and when you leave so \n 22\nmany things will have happened that you will know what to invent while we \nwon\u2019t\u2019. (quoted, Times Higher Education Supplement, 4 February, 2000, 10) \n \nIn this approach to education, there is a \u2018subtle conflation of the distinctive values of \neducation with those of training\u2019 (Taylor, 2000). Modernisation is merely the guise of \na thorough-going marketisation (Rustin, 1998: 99). \n \nIt is this economically driven \u2018vision\u2019 that dominates British government thinking on \neducation and which Leadbeater has helped further entrench. Yet there is a void at its \nheart. As Henry Giroux has eloquently argued with the American case particularly in \nmind, but it applies equally to Britain: \u2018knowledge becomes capital \u2013 a form of \ninvestment in the economy \u2013 but appears to have little value when linked to the power \nof self-definition or the capacities of individuals to expand the scope of freedom\u2019 \n(2000b: 8). None of this is surprising for a Blair government that has swallowed \nwhole the rhetoric of the \u2018information society\u2019, and announced its own \u2018Information \nSociety Initiative\u2019. But it is a concern that even relatively progressive social visions of \npublic institutional reform within British government circles are blind to how \nmarketization is distorting the very frame of educational debate.  \n \nTo counter this, we need, like Leadbeater, to focus on the social values that underlie \neducation and citizenship, but on rather different ones.  \n \nTowards Common Ground? \n \n 23\nIf the values which underpin cultural studies are under threat, it is all the more \nimportant to state them clearly. I want to set out five values, which, taken together, \nrepresent common ground on which cultural studies can stand, or fall, as a discipline. \nTheir apparent obviousness, from the perspective of a democratic view of culture, \ndoes not make them any less important to state. \n \nThe first principle involves valuing what all members of a \u2018culture\u20196 \u2013 any culture \u2013 \nhave to say, in their own voice and not as spoken for by others, about their experience \nof that culture and its productions. What matters is not the achievement of one unified \nvoice that covers over differences, but the multiplication of voices. So Donna \nHaraway in her Cyborg Manifesto writes of a \u2018dream not of a common language, but \nof a powerful infidel heteroglossia\u2019, a mass of different voices and languages (1991: \n223). bell hooks has made the same point, but emphasising the danger that others\u2019 \nspeech may already have been spoken for. Black cultural studies needs, she suggests, \n\u2018new ground\u2019: \n \na counter-hegemonic marginal space where radical black subjectivity is seen, not \noverseen by any authoritative Other claiming to know us better than we know \nourselves.  \n(hooks, 1991: 22,  original emphasis)  \n \nAt stake here is much more than a universal right to speak (a tower of Babel without \nmutual understanding). Necessarily involved is a second principle: the obligation to \nlisten to those other voices.  \n \n 24\nCultural studies has to be a space for both speaking and listening. This second \nprinciple is often forgotten, but it is crucial. As the postcolonialist critic Gayatri \nSpivak has put it: \u2018for me, \u2018\u2018Who should speak?\u2019\u2019 is less crucial than \u2018\u2018\u2018Who will \nlisten?\u2019\u2019\u2019 (1990: 59, quoted in Mercer, 1994: 31). This applies to politics, to academic \nwriting, and to teaching. The classroom itself needs to be a space where each person \ncan be confident that their voice will be recognised and valued (hooks, 1994: 186). \nYet the practice of listening \u2013 of bearing witness (hooks, 1991: 133) \u2013 to each other\u2019s \naccounts of living inside culture is only just beginning to be theorised. There are \ncontinuities here with what Williams wrote forty years ago at the end of Culture and \nSociety: \n \nA good community, a living culture, will . . . not only make room for but actively \nencourage all and any who can contribute to the advance in consciousness which is \nthe common need. Wherever we have started from, we need to listen to others who \nstarted from a different position.  \n(1958: 320, added emphasis)  \n \nThis principle can apply to many different settings: from the interclass politics of \n1950s Britain, to the cultural and racial politics of today\u2019s USA, to the complex \nnegotiations in many parts of the world with globally distributed, commodified \nculture.  \n \nCultural studies, however, should involve not only dialogue, but also reflexivity (this \nis the third principle), including reflection about the means through which all the \nvoices in that dialogue have been formed, and the conditions which have produced the \n 25\nspace of cultural studies itself. That means reflecting both on ourselves and on the \nculture around us: does, for instance, that culture satisfy the principles of cultural \ndemocracy, which the first two principles encapsulate? Critical reflection on shared \nculture, of course, carries risks: of being misunderstood as elitist or unconstructive.7  \nThe risk is unavoidable, but in taking it we must, as John Frow (1995) has argued, be \nfully self-reflexive about the institutional power which enables us to be publicly \ncritical. Cultural studies is the work of critical intellectuals; it is not itself part of the \npopular domain which it discusses, and implying otherwise is bad faith.   \n \nIf such reflexivity is to be effective, it must be theoretically adequate to what it \nreflects upon. In looking at how voices and cultures are formed, it must adopt a \nmaterialist perspective (the fourth principle). Cultural phenomena \u2013 and this is a \ncommon thread throughout the history of cultural studies, wherever it has been \npractised \u2013 are always material processes, which are far from transparent. Who is \nrepresented in them, and how? Who has access to them, and on what terms? And who \ndoes not? Studying culture, then, means examining how hierarchies and exclusions, as \nwell as inclusions, work within culture, whether those of race, class, gender, sexuality, \neducation, age or the relations of power that exist between large-scale cultural \nformations (colonialism, imperialism, economic domination). These questions apply \non all social and geographical scales: personal, local, national, global.  \n \nThese values, while easily stated, do not yield simple answers when applied, in \ncombination, to understanding our lives inside culture. There are dilemmas: how are \nwe to give adequate weight to both speaking and listening, to both self-reflexivity and \ncritical analysis? How can we develop a materialist analysis, which is respectful of the \n 26\nindividual voice? How can we grasp both the complex texture of difference and the \nlarge-scale inequalities of power?  \n \nOnly through open dialogue, which is committed to applying these principles, which \nleads to the fifth and final principle. Quite simply, the first four principles have to be \nactively defended through the work of cultural studies itself. There is no automatic \nconsensus in their favour. Cultural democracy, for which they are necessary \nconditions, is not a \u2018natural\u2019 state, even if we can argue for it on rational grounds. If it \nis to be more than fine ambition, cultural studies must be an empowering practice, a \npractice which acts directly upon the conditions of culture to change them. \n \nCultural studies, in whatever capacity we practise it \u2013 as teacher, student, advocate, or \ncritic \u2013 involves an enduring ethical commitment which is no more reducible to short-\nterm consumption choices than are the values of democracy itself. In both cases, there \nare, of course, powerful forces ranged to convince us otherwise, for the enclosure of \neducation for economically defined ends is one aspect of the impoverishment of \ndemocracy itself. \n \nConclusion: Learning (and Teaching) from Experience \n \nCultural studies\u2019 values must be translated into how we pass on the subject to students \nand beyond them to the wider culture, especially in a commercialised culture which is \nhostile to those values. In this article, I have tried to radicalise Raymond Williams\u2019 \nvision of cultural studies\u2019 values and put it into dialogue with visions from other times \nand places, but in concluding I want to recall that Williams was concerned also with \n 27\nthe practical question of how to teach culture in modern societies and his writings on \nthis still resonate today. \n \nImportant to the British adult education movement in which Williams participated \nwas the principle that education is central to democracy, and must be responsive to \nthe life experiences of those it teaches. Williams\u2019 explicit aim in the writings and \nteaching that later emerged as cultural studies was \u2018the creation of an educated and \nparticipating democracy\u2019 (1993a [1961]: 223). He saw democratic principles \nextending into the classroom:  \n \nPopular education in any worthwhile sense begins from a conception of human \nbeings which . . . insists that no man can judge for another man [sic], that every \nman has a right to the facts and skills on which real judgement is based, that, in this \nsense, all education depends on the acknowledgement of an ultimate human \nequality.  \n(Williams, 1993b [1959]: 123-24)  \n \nThis vision remains important today, for example, in the work of the educational and \ncultural theorist Henry Giroux.  \n \nGiroux, like many writers discussed in this article, has developed his approach to \ncultural studies in response to a crisis, a crisis in educational and cultural authority in \ncontemporary multicultural America as a whole: \n \n 28\nThe emergence of the electronic media coupled with a diminishing faith in the \npower of human agency has undermined the traditional visions of schooling and \nthe meaning of pedagogy. \n(Giroux, 1996: 73) \n \nUnlike authoritarian attacks on American cultural collapse, Giroux is concerned to \nunderstand the real changes in the conditions under which young people now make \nsense of the culture they live in (not necessarily \u2018their\u2019 culture): \n \nYouth . . . are faced with the task of finding their way through a decentred cultural \nlandscape no longer caught in the grip of a technology of print, closed narrative \nstructures, or the certitude of a secure economic future.  \n(1996: 74) \n \nIn this situation, books (our books!) are just one tool among many, and often not the \nmost relevant. Cultural studies, if is to address these cultural realities, must open up \nchances for cultural production by the students themselves. Doing cultural studies \nmeans, as Giroux explains, getting critical skills, demystifying the processes of \nrepresentation through examining how meanings are produced, becoming aware of \nrepresentation\u2019s underlying politics. It means \u2018cultural recovery\u2019: recovering histories \nthat you have not heard before (1996: 89), including your own; it means finding a \nvoice.  \n \nThere are, of course, many ways of finding a voice, and academic education connects \nwith just one of them. But, as an academic practice, cultural studies is unique in that it \n 29\ntreats the process of finding a voice as part of what it studies (Couldry, 2000, chapter \n6). This involves, of course, teachable skills, but it is not reducible to \u2018training\u2019, \nunless we mean training to be active and critical participants in the surrounding \nculture, training for citizenship. Citizenship, if it is to be more than empty formalism, \nrequires an engagement with the claims of others, with questions of justice. But, as \nthe political philosopher Seyla Benhabib (1992) argues, justice requires always an \nengagement with \u2018the concrete other\u2019, not merely an abstract, generalised other. For \njustice and therefore for an adequate notion of citizenship, there must be a \ncommitment to dialogue with concrete others.8 If we take seriously the material \nconstraints on others, indeed oneself, entering into dialogue and acquiring a voice, \nthen cultural studies\u2019 reflexive work becomes part of the dialogue integral to \ncontemporary citizenship as a whole.  \n \nCultural studies should not just study, but embody, the conditions for new forms of \ndemocratic political exchange, \u2018restoring the language of ethics, agency, power and \nidentity\u2019 (Giroux, 1996: 53). This is the true moving force of cultural studies as a \ndiscipline.9 That means, always, listening to the experiences of others. Raymond \nWilliams, in a letter written at the end of his work for the WEA, reflected in these \nterms: \n \nThe tutor . . . may not know the gaps between academic thinking and actual \nexperience among many people; he [the tutor, as opposed to the student] may not \nknow when, in the pressure of experience, a new discipline has to be created. \n(1993a [1961]: 224). \n \n 30\nCultural studies was that new discipline, and yet we are a long way from achieving, \nanywhere, the participatory culture for which Williams hoped. Worse, cultural studies \nmust now defend its values against prevailing educational discourses which would \ndeny the very space of dialogue on which Williams\u2019 vision relied. \n \nIronically \u2013 but a hidden irony, that we must insist others confront \u2013 it is a \ncommodified culture, whose categorical imperative is flexibility and the embracing of \nceaseless change, that denies the space for making the one change that would matter: \nthe construction of a common culture, a space for hearing each others\u2019 questions \nabout how we belong, with no guarantee of answers. If cultural studies matters, it is \nbecause it still values the possibility of such a space. \n 31\n \nAcknowledgements \n \nMany thanks to Henry Giroux, for his continual inspiration and encouragement. \nThanks also to Richard Smith for researching UK press reactions to Charles \nLeadbeater\u2019s work. \n \nReferences \n \nAppiah, Anthony (1986) \u2018The uncompleted argument: du Bois and the illusion of \nrace\u2019 in H.
