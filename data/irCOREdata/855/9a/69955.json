The last family is related to certain fractal like subsets of the unit square.\n1991 Mathematics subject classification: 47 D25.\n1. Introduction\nThe isomorphism class of a direct limit of full matrix algebras (a UHF C*-algebra) is\ncompletely determined by the supernatural number associated with the sequence of\nranks of the matrix algebras ([3]). A number of recent papers [1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13,\n14] have been devoted to non-self-adjoint subalgebras of UHF algebras (and, more\ngenerally, of AF C*-algebras). Usually, the algebras in question contain a canonical\nmasa in the sense of Stratila and Voiculescu [11]; often they are triangular: the\nintersection with the adjoint algebra is the canonical masa. The purpose of this note is\nto give a complete classification of three particular families of triangular subalgebras of\nUHF algebras: The first family consists of those algebras which arise as the direct limit\nof a system of upper triangular matrix algebras, where the embeddings are alternately\nthe refinement and the standard embeddings. The second family arises from refinement\nembeddings with a twist (cf. [5]), and the third family is a class of homogeneous nest\nsubalgebras related to fractal subsets of the unit square.\nFor all classifications we use the topologized fundamental relation, which we believe\nto be an effective and intuitive discriminant.\nFor the first family it will be convenient to write the full matrix algebras in the direct\nsystems which arise as tensor products; so our systems will have the form\nUpper triangular subalgebras, Tklkl kn, in Mkt \u00ae \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u00ae Mkn are specified by giving a\ntotal order to the minimal projections in the natural diagonal algebra Dkl (g> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u00ae Dkn,\n107\n108 A. HOPENWASSER AND S. C. POWER\nwhere for each k, Dk is the algebra of diagonal matrices in Mk. Let [fc] denote the set\n{1,2,...,k) and suppose that {e,| Je[fcm]} are the minimal projections of Dkm, totally\nordered according to the order on the index set. Then the set of minimal projections of\nDkl \u00ae \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u00ae Dkn is [eh \u00ae \u2022\u2022\u2022 \u00aeein\\ime[k^],m = l , . . . ,n} . Totally order this set by the\nlexicographic order on the natural index set 7tm = 1[\/cm]; this yields the order with respect\nto which Tklk2 km is the algebra of upper triangular matrices.\nThroughout this paper we fix one set of canonical matrix units for each algebra\nMkl \u00ae \u2022 \u2022\u2022 \u00ae Mkn. These matrix units will be indexed by pairs of multi-indices i, j in\n7C=i[fcJ: i f '=(\u00bbi.\u2022\u2022\u2022>'\u00bb) and j = (ju---,j\u00bb) then eu=eilh \u00ae \u2022\u2022\u2022 \u00ae eWn. Note that\netJeTklk2...*\u201e if, and only if, i^j (lexicographic order).\nNow suppose that the (UHF) C*-algebra B is given as the direct limit of the system\nMkl ^Mkl \u00ae Mh-+Mkl \u00ae Mk2 \u00ae Af\u00bb,-\u00bb \u2022 \u2022 \u2022,\nwith unital embeddings which carry the diagonal algebras into diagonal algebras and\nthe upper triangular algebras into upper triangular algebras. Then this yields subsystems\nand\nwith limits D and T respectively. We have DzT^B, D is a (regular) canonical masa in\nB, and TnT*=D.\nThere are many isomorphism types of such canonical triangular algebras. Indeed,\ncertain UHF algebras contain uncountably many distinct types in each of the three\nfamilies under consideration.\nThe two embeddings used in the first family are the refinement embedding, p, and the\nstandard embedding, a, given by\np,: Mk^Mk \u00ae M(: [ao]\nand\no,:Mk->Mk\u00ae Mt:a^>a@---\u00aea (t factors).\nThe positive integer t is the multiplicity of the embedding. Note that a, = AdUnopt for a\nsuitable unitary operator l\/n induced by a permutation n of the minimal projections in\nDk \u00ae Dt.\nThe action of pknt, on the matrix units of Mkl \u00ae \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u00ae Mkn may be described in terms\nof indices as follows: the matrix unit bearing the indices (i1,...,in) and {ji,..-,jn) is\ncarried to the sum of all those matrix units in Mkl \u00ae \u2022\u2022\u2022 \u00ae M t n + 1 with indices\n{iu...,in,h) and {jlt..., jn,h), where he\\_kn+ J .\nThe permutation n for which akn+l can be expressed as AdUnopkn+i is obtained via a\nCLASSIFICATION OF LIMITS OF TRIANGULAR MATRIX ALGEBRAS 109\nprocess of \"reverse lexicography\": the set [fcn + 1 ] x [k^ x \u2022\u2022\u2022 x [fcj with the lexico-\ngraphic order is totally ordered and has the same cardinality as [ I t j x \u2022\u2022\u2022 x [ d j x\n[\/cn + 1 ] .

For each family, the supernatural number associated with the\nsequence kl,k2,k3,... is a complete invariant, i.e. two algebras from the same family are\nisoinetrically isomorphic if, and only if, their associated supernatural numbers are equal.\nBy the way it is evident that no refinement limit can be isomorphic to a standard limit:\nthe refinement limits are all nest subalgebras of the ambient U H F algebra while the\nstandard limits possess no invariant projections.\nOne direction of the classification result cited above follows from [8, Theorem 6.14]:\nTheorem 1. Let D^T^Bi, i = 1,2, where Bt is a UHF algebra, \u00a3>, is a {regular)\ncanonical masa, and 7] is a closed subalgebra of Bt (or even a closed Di-bimodule) which\ngenerates B; as a C*-algebra. If Tt and T2 are isometrically isomorphic than Bl and B2\nare isomorphic C*-algebras.\nThis theorem will be useful in the classification of the pa-alternation algebras. See\nalso [5, Theorem 3.26 and 2, Theorem 3.3] for a similar result.\nAnother major tool in this classification will be the fundamental relation introduced\nin [8]. Its value lies in the fact that it acts as a complete invariant for triangular\nsubalgebras of AF C*-algebras [9]. Given a triple D^T^B as above, the fundamental\nrelation will be a topologized relation defined on the maximal ideal space M(D) of D in\nterms of normalizing partial isometries in I A partial isometry, v, in T is normalizing if\nvDv*^D and v*Dv^D. For elements x and y in M(D), viewed as states on D, define\nyR{T)x if, and only if, there is a normalizing partial isometry veT such that\nx(d) = y{odv*), for all deD. [8, Lemma 6.3].\nWe shall need to specify the fundamental relation for the pa-algebras; for complete-\nness, we will do the same for the pure refinement and pure standard algebras, although\nthese are in the literature [8]. The task is made simpler by the fact that it is sufficient to\nuse the canonical set of matrix units for T in place of all normalizing partial isometries,\nsee [9].\nIf e is a matrix unit, let E = {(y,x)\\yR(T)x via the matrix unit e}. The fundamental\nrelation is topologized by taking all such sets \u00a3 as a base for a topology on R(T). It\nturns out that the basic sets, E, are compact in this topology, and this will be useful\n110 A. HOPENWASSER AND S. C. POWER\nlater in classifying the twisted refinement embeddings. This topology is not the same as\nthe relative product topology obtained from the Gelfand topology on M{D). The main\ntheorem in [9] states, amongst other things, that two canonical triangular subalgebras\nof AF C*-algebras are isometrically isomorphic if, and only if, their associated\nfundamental relations are isomorphic as topologized relations.\nThe first step in describing the fundamental relation is the identification of M(D) with\nn\u2122=l [fcn]. Indeed, x is completely determined by its values on the projections of D, each\nof which necessarily lies in one of the finite dimensional subalgebras Dkl \u00ae \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u00ae Dkn. In\neach such subalgebra there is a unique minimal projection, say e{xi Xn) = ex, \u00ae ' \" \u00ae\neXn, at which x takes the value 1 and the index coordinates are coherent from level to\nlevel; thus we may identify x with an element (xl,x2,x3,...) in n\u2122= t [fcj. Conversely,\neach point in n%\n x \\k\u201e] determines a state on D and this correspondence between M(D)\nand n\u2122= j [&\u201e] is a homeomorphism with respect to the Gelfand topology on M{D) and\nthe product topology on n\u2122=1 [\/cn].\nA projection of the form e = eiU in) in D corresponds to a subset of M(D); that\nsubset is {xenn\u00b0=i[kn]\\x1 = il,...,xn = in}. Normalizing partial isometries, v, act by\nconjugation e-*vev* on projections in D, and so carry certain totally ordered families of\nprojections {e(Xl Xn)} corresponding to points x in 7C=1[\/cn] into other totally ordered\nfamilies; in other words, each v induces a partial homeomorphism on n\u2122=, [\/cj. In\nparticular, if i = (i1,...,in) and j = {ji,---,jn) then the matrix unit ei} has domain\n{x\\x1 = j 1 , . . . , x n = j n } , r a n g e {y\\yi = ii,...,yn = in}, a n d a c t s b y ( A , . . . , ; B , x n + 1 , . . . ) ! - \u00bb \u2022\n(il,...,in,xn+ !,...)\u2022 (This follows from repeated use of the fact that the matrix unit with\nindices (iu...,Q and (ju..., jn) in Mkl \u00ae \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u00ae Mkn is carried by p into a sum of matrix\nunits, each with indices of the form (il,...,in,xn+1) and (ju...,jn,xn + l).) Since the\ncanonical matrix units determine the fundamental order, we have yR(T)x if, and only if\ny and x have a common tail (ye = xe, for all s>n) and the initial segment of y for this\ntail, (y!,..., yn), precedes (x,,..., xn) lexicographically.\nTo determine the fundamental relation for the standard embeddings,\nit is most convenient to reindex the minimal projections in each Dkl \u00ae \u2022 \u2022 \u00ae Dkn. (In\nother words, we use a different isomorphism between M(D) and 7i\"=1 [&\u201e].) Recall that\nGk2'-Mkl->Mkl \u00ae Mk2 has the form AdUn\u00b0pkl where n is induced from the total order\nisomorphism (\/>:[\/c2] x [^lD^C'i] x [^2] with domain and range carrying the lexico-\ngraphic order. Replace the index <j>{i2,h) for a minimal projection in Dkl \u00ae Dk2 by (ii,i2)\nitself; the minimal projections of Dkl \u00ae Dk2 are again indexed by [ki]x[&2], but now\nthe order is reverse lexicographic. Repetition yields the reverse lexicographic order on\neach of the index sets [\/cx] x \u2022\u2022\u2022 x [\/cB] for the minimal projections of Dkl \u00ae \u2022\u2022\u2022 \u00ae Dkn.\nFurthermore, with this reindexing, once again we have that a matrix unit in Mkl \u00ae \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u00ae\nMkn with indices i = (il,...,in) and j = (ji,...,jn) is carried to a sum of matrix units, each\nwith indices (il,...,in,xn + 1) and {jl,...,jB,xn + l), xn+l taking all values in [\/cn+1]. Also\nCLASSIFICATION OF LIMITS OF TRIANGULAR MATRIX ALGEBRAS 111\nthe matrix unit ei} lies in Tk. kn if, and only if, i <rj (reverse lexicographic order). Thus,\nwe obtain yR(T)x if, and only if, y and x have the same tails and the initial segment of\ny preceeds the initial segment of x in reverse lexicographic order.\nThe fundamental relation for the alternating embeddings,\nlk0 1kokl\ncan be obtained by alternating the procedures for p and a, or more simply from the\nobservation that ok2opki:Mko-*Mko\u00ae Mkl<g> Mk2 has the form AdU^opkik2 where n is\ninduced by the isomorphism\n4>:[\/cJ x [\/c0] x [\/c J^[\/c0] x [fcj x [\/c2],\ndomain and range ordered lexicographically. Relabelling the indices of minimal\nprojections as above, it follows that yR{T)x if, and only if, y and x have the same tails\nand the initial segment of y precedes the initial segment of x in the \"quasi-lexicographic\"\norder in which the highest even index of the initial segment takes precedence and we\nthen proceed down the even indexed terms and back up the odd indexed terms.\nThere is a variation of this which is notationally handy for the proof of the\nclassification of the alternating embedding: relabel the even terms so that they carry\nnegative indices (in reverse order, of course) and the odd terms so that they are indexed\nby all the positive integers. If we then consider the system\nthen M(D) isomorphic to 7ini_00 [ s j X7t^ \u00b0=1 [rn], and yR(T)x if, and only if, y and x\nhave the same double infinite tail (i.e. yj=Xj for j<\u2014n and j>n) and the \"middle\"\nsegments (y-\u201e,...,yn) and (x-\u201e,..., xn) are ordered lexicographically.\nAs mentioned earlier, if two triangular subalgebras of AF algebras (with canonical\ndiagonals) are isometrically isomorphic, then their topologized fundamental relations are\nisomorphic. We can use this fact to see that no algebra in one of the classes considered\nabove can be isometrically isomorphic to an algebra in another class. Of course, we\nhave already distinguished refinement embeddings from standard embeddings via the\nrespective existence and lack of invariant projections. The alternation embedding may\nbe distinguished from the refinement embedding in precisely the same way while the\ndistinction between alternation and standard is dealt with in [5, Ex. 3.2] with an\nargument rather more complicated than the one below.\nFor xeM(\u00a3>), define the orbit of x to be {yeM(D)\\yR{T)x}. Orbits and their\ntopological properties are preserved by isomorphism of fundamental relations. The\ndisjointness of the three classes of triangular algebra is apparent from the following\norbit structure properties of their fundamental relations. If T is a pure refinement\n112 A. HOPENWASSER AND S. C. POWER\nalgebra, then R(T) has one finite orbit (cardinality = 1; generator is x = (l, 1,1...)); one\ndense orbit (generator is x = (kl,k2,k3,...)); while all remaining orbits are infinite and\nnon-dense. If T is a pure standard algebra, then R(T) has countably many finite orbits\n(the generators are those x with tails in which all coordinates are l's), while all\nremaining orbits are dense. If T is a pa-alternation algebra, then R(T) has one finite\norbit (cardinality = 1; generator is x = (..., 1,1,1,...)); uncountably many dense orbits\n(generators have infinitely many coordinates greater than 1 in negatively indexed\nlocations); and uncountably many infinite, non-dense orbits (generators have at least\none coordinate entry greater than 1 while all but finitely many negatively indexed\ncoordinates are equal to 1). All of these facts have completely straightforward\nverifications.\n2. Classification of pcr-alternation algebras\nWe now turn to the determination of the isometric isomorphism classes of the\nper-alternation algebras. Supoose T is the limit of a system\nand S is the limit of\nf t Pti qr a\"2 T Ptz T . . .\n^ '\n J i i * ( i u i i r i u i i 2\nIf T and S are isometrically isomorphic then, by Theorem 1, their enveloping UHF\nC*-algebras are isomorphic and so we must then have that the supernatural number for\nthe multiplicities associated with T\u2014denote by sn(rhs,)\u2014equals sn(thUj), the super-\nnatural number associated with S. On the other hand, the supernatural numbers\nassociated with the refinement multiplicities, sn(rj) and sn(tj), need not be the same since\nwe can modify finitely many embeddings without changing the limit algebra. This turns\nout to be all the freedom available. Define two supernatural numbers to be finitely\nequivalent if they differ by finite factors. Let ~\n f denote this equivalence relation. With\nthe notation above, we have the following result:\nTheorem 2. Let T be a pa-alternation algebra with refinement multiplicities rt and\nstandard multiplicities s,- and let S be another such algebra with refinement multiplicities tt\nand standard multiplicities ut. Then T is isometrically isomorphic to S if, and only if,\nsn(rj, st) = sn(th \u00ab,-), sn{rj) ~ f sn(tt) and su{s() ~ f sn(ut).\nThe necessity of the condition on the supernatural numbers will require a way to\nCLASSIFICATION OF LIMITS OF TRIANGULAR MATRIX ALGEBRAS 113\nrecover the ~ j-equivalence classes of sn(r{) and sn(st) from the fundamental relation\nR(T). With O(x) denoting the closure of the orbit, 0(x), of x, the following notion is the\nkey.\nDefinition. A pair (x,x+)eM(D)xM(D) is a gap pair if x+ $0{x) and O(xT) =\nO[x]u{x+}.\nThe first task is to identify which elements (x,x+) form gap pairs. For xeM(D) and\np>0, let MSp(x) = (x_p,...,xp), the symmetric \"middle segment\" of length 2p. For each\nx \u20ac M{D), a neighbourhood base for x in the Gelfand topology for M(D) is given by the\nfamily Np(x) = {y \\ MSp(y) = MSp(x)}, p= 1,2,3,.... Observe that yeOfx) if, and only if,\nfor any p>0 there is an integer q>p such that MSJiy)<MSJix). (The order is\nlexicographic.) From this it follows that O(x) # M(D) (non-dense orbit) if, and only if,\nthere is an integer p such that x,= 1 for all q^p. If x is to be part of a gap pair, it must\nhave non-dense orbit; thus, x must have a left tail consisting of l's. The next lemma\nshows that if we add the requirement that x have a right tail consisting of maximal\nelements, then we will have identifed all the elements x in M(D) which are the left\ncoordinate of a gap pair. The context for this lemma is the fundamental relation R{T)\nfor a pa \u2014 alteration algebra with refinement multiplicities rf and standard multiplicities\ns;. M(D) is identified with Jrn^0[\/cn], where fen = s_n when n<0 and kn = rn when n>0.\nLemma. If(x,x+) is a gap pair, then x has the following two properties:\n(1) There is an integer n such that xm= 1, for all m^n.\n(2) There is an integer p such that xq = kq for all q^p.\nConversely, suppose that x satisfies (1) and (2) and that p is the smallest integer for which\n(2) is valid. Define x+ by\n,_! + ! ifj =\n P-l\nThen (x,x+) is a gap pair.\nProof. We have already seen that condition (1) must hold when x is the left\ncoordinate of a gap pair. Suppose however, that condition (2) is not satisfied. So, for\ninfinitely many n>0, xn#\/cn. Suppose that zeM(D) satisfies z\u00a3O(x) and xe0(z) We\nclaim that O(z)\\0(x) has infinite cardinality. This is more than enough; even card\n[0(z)\\0(x)] ^ 2 for all such z shows that x cannot be the left coordinate of a gap pair.\nAs for the claim, when z does not have a left tail consisting of l's, we may produce\nfrom z a point in 0(z)\\0(x) by decreasing a single coordinate of z which lies sufficiently\nfar to the left. Under the hypothesis on z there are infinitely many ways to do this. On\nthe other hand, if z does have a left tail consisting of l's, then we can produce from x a\npoint in 0(z)\\0(x) by increasing a single coordinate of x which lies sufficiently far to the\n114 A. HOPENWASSER AND S. C. POWER\nright. Thus, if (x,x+) is a gap pair, x must satisfy both conditions (1) and (2). The\nconverse is straightforward to verify.\nProof of Theorem 2. Assume that T with refinement and standard multiplicities r,\nand s, and S with refinement multiplicities t, and \u00ab, are isometrically isomorphic. As\nmentioned earlier, it then follows that sn(rt,sD = sn(ti,u^ and R(T) is isomorphic to R(S)\nas topological binary relations. Furthermore, this order isomorphism is implemented by\nan order preserving homeomorphism il\/:M(DT)-*M(Ds), where DT and Ds are the\nrespective canonical masas.\nLet (x,x+) be a gap pair in M(DT)xM(DT). Then (\\j\/(x),4\/(x+)) is a gap pair in\nM(DS) x M(DS). The restriction of \\\\i to 0(x) induces an order isomorphism from O(x)\nwith the relative R(7>fundamental relation to 0(<A(x)) with the relative R(S)-\nfundamental relation.\nSince x is the left coordinate of a gap pair, there are integers n and p such that xm = 1\nfor all m^n and xq = kq for all q^p. Assume that n is the largest such integer and p the\nsmallest. Also, keep in mind that kj=Sj if j < 0 and kj=rj if 7>0.\nObserve that yeO(x) if, and only if, ym=l for all m^n and (_vn + 1,...,_yp_1)<\n(xn + 1 X p - j ) . The right p-tail of y is arbitrary. Let h be the cardinality of the set of\nwords preceding, or equal to, (xn+l,...,xp^1) in [\/cn+1] x \u2022\u2022\u2022 x [kp-{]. Then O(x)s[h] x\n7t,gp[\/c(,] and the relative R(T) order on O(x) corresponds to the order in which initial\nsegments are lexicographically ordered and tails are the same, i.e. the pure refinement\norder with multiplicities h, kp, kp+u.... (If it should happen that p = n + l, simply delete\nh). Note that sn(r{) ~fsn(h,kp,kp+u...).\nNow make exactly the same observations for 0{\\li{x)). But O(x) ^  0(i\/f(x)) and they\nboth carry the fundamental relation of a pure refinement algebra, so their associated\nsupernatural numbers are equal. Thus sn(rt) and sn{ti) are finitely equivalent to the same\nsupernatural number, hence to each other.\nIt remains to show that sn(Si) and sn(Ui) are finitely equivalent. We shall write kn and\nk'n, n # 0 , for the multiplicities in the defining systems for T and S. It suffices to prove\nthe following fact: there are integers q and h \u2014 1 such that, for any integer \/ < q there\nexists an integer j< \u2014 1 so that ^...k^-y divides (h\u2014l)kj...k_l. (Of course we also\nneed the symmetric fact expressed by interchanging the roles of the sequences k and k',\nbut this is obtained by replacing ip by ij\/ ~1 in the argument below.)\nAgain we shall exploit the facts that \\]\/ preserves closed orbits generated by left\ncoordinates of gap pairs and that such closed orbits with the relative fundamental\nrelation are naturally isomorphic to the fundamental relations of pure refinement\nalgebras. A close orbit of this form is determined by integers n<m and a word \/ in\n[\/cn] x \u2022\u2022\u2022 x [\/cm]. Denoting the orbit by [n ,m;\/] we have [n ,m; \/ ] = {xeM{D)|x; = 1 for\ni<n and ( x n , . . . , x m ) g \/ } . Abusing notation somewhat, we shall let \/ also denote the\nnumber of words, w, in [\/cj x \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 x [\/cm] such that w ^  \/ lexicographically.\nLet \/! = [\u20141,1,\/cj]. Then B = tplA) = [p,q;h] for some integers p<q and word h. Let\nl<q be given. Without loss of generality, we may assume l<p.\nChoose an integer j< \u2014 1 so that any element x in \\j\/~i\\_l-l,l;k'e] has the property\nthat x, = l for all i^j. Let E = [j-l,j;kj] and let F = i]\/(E) = [_v,w;\/]. Because\nCLASSIFICATION OF LIMITS OF TRIANGULAR MATRIX ALGEBRAS 115\nF2[\/-I,\/;&;], we will have w^l. We now have AzE, B<=F, ip(A) = B and ip(E) = F.\nNow view \u00a3 and F as fundamental relations of appropriate pure refinement algebras.\nThe subsets A and B correspond to projections in the canonical masas and, since\nip(A) = B, these projections have the same traces. (The trace in each case is the unique\ntrace in the enveloping UHF C*-algebra). Easy calculations yield tr{A) \u2014 (kj...k_1)~l\nand tr[B) = (h \u2014 l){f-k'w...k'q-i)~1. Here, \/ and h have the integer interpretation. Thus\nf \u2022k'w...k'q_1=(h\u2014l)kJ...k-l. Since w<l, ^ . . . \/ c ^ divides (h\u2014l)kj...k-1, as desired.\nFor the sufficiency of the conditions on the supernatural numbers, observe first that\nwe may as well assume that sn{rj = sn(ti) and sn(st) = sn(M,). (Limit algebras are\nunchanged by modifying finitely many embeddings.) The suffiency flows out of the\nsimple observation that p and a commute, i.e. pras=aspr, for all r, s. Then, with\nn2 = r1slnl and n3 = r2r1s2slnl = r2s2n2, the following diagram commutes:\nFrom this, it is a routine matter to construct the usual zig-zag diagram between the\nsystems\nT Pr'> T g \" ) T Pr2> \u2022\u2022\u2022\n'n\\ 'ni 'ns\n\"T P'> T ^m y Pt2 . . .\nmi 'rrt2 W13\nto show that the limit algebras are isometrically isomorphic.\nRemarks 1. In [10] it was shown that within a certain family of limits of upper\ntriangular matrix algebras the Banach algebra isomorphism type and the isometric\nisomorphism type agree (10, Corollary 3.2 and Remark 3.4). In view of this, and the fact\nthat this family contains the pa-alternation limit algebras, Theorem 2 is also valid with\nisometric isomorphism replaced by Banach algebra isomorphism.\n2. During the preparation of this manuscript we learned that Y.-T. Poon [7] has\nindependently obtained Theorem 2. The method of proof seems to be quite different.\n3. Classification of refinement-twist embeddings\nAn important aspect of the pa-embeddings is that they commute: a composition of\nrefinement and standard embeddings is independent of the order of composition. This\n116 A. HOPENWASSER AND S. C. POWER\nallowed us to obtain easily the sufficiency condition for isomorphism in the theorem\nabove. Consideration of classes of embeddings without such commutation leads to a\nmuch tighter connection between the limit algebra isomorphism type and the ordered\nsequence of embeddings. We illustrate this rigidity phenomenon with the following\ntheorem. Once more the fundamental relation serves as an effective discriminant.\nWrite xr:Tkl-*Tkxr for the unital embeddings of multiplicity r given by {AdUkir)opr\nwhere Us is the permutation unitary in Ms which interchanges the last two minimal\nprojections of Ds. We refer to these as elementary twist embeddings. These embeddings\nand their limit algebras were introduced by Peters, Poon and Wagner [5]. Notice that\nthe composition xri \u00b0prz-Tkl^Tkirir2 coincides with Trir2:7I,-\u00bb7Iirir2 but not with pr2oxrr\nTheorem 3. Let T = lim Tnk and S = lim Tmk with respect to elementary twist embeddings.\nThen T and S are isometrically isomorphic if and only if there is an integer j such that\nnk+J = mk for all large k.\nProof. In order to describe the fundamental relation R(T) and its topology it is\nhelpful to identify the Gelfand space M(DT) with the Gelfand space of the unital\nC*-algebra of functions on [0,1] generated by characteristic functions of intervals [a, b)\nwhere a<b and a = i\/nk, b = j\/nt for some i, j , k, I. In particular there are natural maps\nn:M(DT)->[0,1], n[2):R(T)-^-[0,1] x [0,1]. The map n is surjective. Notice that T and\nthe pure refinement algebra \/4 = lim(Tnk, pk), where pk has multiplicity rk = nk+1\/nk,\nfc=l,2,..., have a common subalgebra T0 = \\imT\u00b0k. Here, T\u00b0k<=Tnk is the unital\nsubalgebra (1\u2014 p)C + Tnkp, where p is the largest proper projection of Lat Tnk (the\ninvariant projection lattice). It follows that ni2)(R(T)) contains 7r(2)(R(T0)), and this set is\nthe union of the appropriate rational superdiagonals of [0,1) x [0,1) together with the\ndiagonal A = {(t,t):te[0,1]}.\nEvery compact, open set E in R(T) corresponds to a finite union of graphs E(v)\nassociated with the canonical matrix units v (see [9]). Here E{v) is the set of pairs (y, x)\nwith y = a(x), a. is the partial homomorphism induced by v (as described in the\nintroduction), and x is a point of the domain of a. If clni in Tnt has image v in T then it\nis elementary to verify that n{2\\E(v)) is the set suggested by the following diagram:\ny\n\/\nk\nCLASSIFICATION OF LIMITS OF TRIANGULAR MATRIX ALGEBRAS 117\nIn the diagram\nJ\nand ak is defined inductively by\n, frk-2 1 , rk-2\\\n\\nk + 1 nk nk + 1j\nThus, 7t(2)(\u00a3(i;)) is the union of the closed diagonal segments of the diagrams\nfor fc=l,2,..., together with the initial segment from (0,1\u2014^-) to au and the limit\npoint, (p, 1), say.\nSimilarly, any matrix unit w in 7^k\\T\u00b0k has a graph nm(E(w)) which is eventually\ncongruent to 7i(2)(\u00a3(i;)). More precisely, there exists s in (0,1) such that\n([0,1] x [1 - s , 1]) n ni2\\E(v)) is a vertical translate of ([0,1] x [1 - s , 1]) n 7r(2)(\u00a3(w)).\nSuppose now that (f>:T->S is an isometric isomorphism. Then <j> extends to a star\nisomorphism $:C*(T)-\u00bbC*(S) (by [6], or [2]) and so <f> preserves the unique normalised\ntraces on T and S. Also <\u00a3(T0) = S0 (by the proof of Theorem 1). If 0:K(To)->\/?(So) is the\ninduced topological isomorphism it follows that we have a commuting diagram:\nid\nLet v' be the image of elmi in S. Since v' is a normalising partial isometry in S\\S0,\n118 A. HOPENWASSER AND S. C. POWER\n(f>~l(v') must be a normalising partial isometry in T\\T0, and so n(2\\E((j>~l(v'))) is\neventually congruent to 7i(2)(\u00a3(t;)). But, because of the commuting diagram this means\nthat the sequence (ak) for v is eventually congruent to the sequence (a!,), say, for v', by a\nvertical translation. The desired conclusion now follows. \u2022\nRemark. It is not difficult to indentify the fundamental relation for the twisted\nrefinement limit algebra with multiplicites ku k2,... as it appears in the 7i\u2122=1[fen]\nrepresentation. For most matrix units etj in Tkl kn, T(ey) = p(ey). This equality fails to\nhold only when j = (ku...,kn). In this case, p(etj) is a sum of kn + l matrix units in\nTil...*\u201e + , of which two of the terms in the sum must be modified to produce t(gy). The\nsummands of p(ey) have multi-indices (i,h) and (j,h), for h=\\,...,kn + i (where we write i\nfor (ij, . . . , in), etc.). The summands to be modified are the last two, corresponding to the\naction of the twist on the last two columns. The two replacement partial isometries have\nindices (i,kn + 1),(j,kn+1-l) and (i,kn + 1 -l),(j,kn + i).\nTracking ei} forward under subsequent embeddings allows the identification of the\ncorresponding partial homeomorphism on M(D). The domain is the set of all sequences\nin M(D) with initial segment j . If at least one jp # kp, then the partial homeomorphism\nacts just as it does in the pure refinement setting. When j l = k1,...,jn = kn, the action on\na point (ki,...,kn, xn + l,...) can be described intuitively as follows: the first n coordinates\nare converted to iu...,ia. Now look at the tail. If it begins with a coordinate ^fen + 1 \u20142,\nthe whole tail is unmodified. If it begins with kn+l \u2014 1, then this term is changed to kn + l\nand the rest of the tail is unmodified. If the tail begins with a string of maximal terms,\neach of these is decreased by 1; the first non-maximal term, xm, is unchanged unless it is\nequal to km\u2014 1, in which case it is increased by 1. Subsequent terms are unchanged. If\nthe tail consists entirely of maximal terms, each is decreased by 1.\nAlthough the partial homeomorphisms induced by etJ are different from those induced\nin the refinement case (when j l = ki,...,jn=k^}, all but one point of the graph of eti in\nthe twisted embedding lies in the graph of some matrix unit in the refinement\nembedding.\nWith T the twisted refinement limit algebra, we then have the following description of\nR(T): If some xn#\/cn, then yR(T)x if and only if y and x have identical tails and the\ninitial segment of y precedes the initial segment of x lexicographically. If xn = kn for all n,\nyR(T)x if and only if ym = km\u2014 1, for all m sufficiently large. These latter points are the\nlimit points on the right hand edge in the [0,1] x [0,1] representation.\n4. Classification of some homogeneous limit algebras\nIf m = nr, define <j>r:Tm-*Tnr by 0(ay) = (ayl\/;~'') where Ur in Mr is the cyclic backward\nshift. For convenience we call such embeddings homogeneous embeddings; the associated\nlimit algebras T have the homogeneous property that subalgebras pTp, qTq determined\nby interval projections p, q of equal trace, are isometrically isomorphic. We shall obtain\nthe following rigidity theorem by examining the fractal-like subsets of the square arising\nas support sets for normalising partial isometries, as in the last section. Of course one\nCLASSIFICATION OF LIMITS OF TRIANGULAR MATRIX ALGEBRAS 119\ncould consider, more generally, homogeneous limit algebras relative to a sequence of\narbitrary permutation unitaries, but we focus here on the purely cyclic case.\nTheorem 4. Let T = \\imTnk and S = limTmic with respect to homogeneous embeddings\n(associated with backward cyclic shifts). Then T and S are isometrically isomorphic if and\nonly if there is an integer j such that nk+j = mk for all large k.\nProof. As before, the trace functional gives rise to natural projections n:M(DT)->\n[0,1], 7r(2):R(T)->[0,1](2), with similar maps for M(DS) and R(S). Assume that T and S\nare isometrically isomorphic by an isomorphism <x:T->S. Once again, since trace is\npreserved, we obtain a commuting diagram:\nR{T)JLR(S)\n[0,1] (2) . id \u2022[0,1]\n(2)\nLet c.-.i+i be a superdiagonal matrix unit in Tnk with image v in T, and graph\nE(v)<=R(T). Then the set E = ni2\\E(v)) is an intersection EinE2n--- where Et is the\nsquare of side \\\/nk in the i, i+l location of the n2 refinement of [0,1](2), and Ek + lcEk\nis the finite union of rk = nk+Jnk subsquares of sidelength l\/nk + l located in one of the rk\npossible cyclic patterns. Note in particular that each Ek contains a superdiagonal\nsubsquare, E\\ say, and that Ek+1 n Ek is always in the backward cyclic shift pattern. The\nfollowing diagram illustrates two generations of subsquares of a given square of Ek:\nRecall that every normalising partial isometry is a sum of matrix units, modulo unitary\nmultipliers from the diagonal ([8, Lemma 6.3]). It follows from this, and the commuting\ndiagram, that n{2\\E(v)) = 7t(2)(\u00a3(a(u))) is a disjoint union of sets E(w{),..., E(wk) asso-\nciated with matrix units w,, . . . ,wt in 7} for some j .\nWe claim that such an equality E = E(W1)V-KJ E(wk) is only possible if the scaling\n120 A. HOPENWASSER AND S. C. POWER\ndimensions (nk) and (mk) are asymptotically equal. Here is one way to see this geometric\nfact.\nNote first that if nk + Jnk = 2 for all k^.k0, for some k0, then \u00a3 is a union of closed line\nsegments, and in the alternative case \u00a3 is a set containing no line segments. However, in\nthe former case if T and S are isometrically isomorphic then they have the same\nsupernatural number invariant, namely \/2\u00b0\u00b0 for some natural number \/, and the\nconclusion of the theorem follows trivially in this case. Accordingly we may assume the\nlatter \"fractal\" case for both (nk) and (mk).\nIt t is a subsquare ot the unit square, with vertices with rational coordinates, then\nsay that Fl,...,Fr is a permutation covering of F if Fu...,Fr are congruent closed\nsquares such that for some permutation n of { l , . . . , r} , F, is the square of the r2\nrefinement of \u00a3 located in the i, n(i) position. Call the reciprocal of the sidelength of a\nset F, the size of the permutation cover. All squares are assumed to have sides parallel\nto those of the unit square. For a given square F the set of sizes of permutation\ncoverings is an intrinsic property of F. We leave it as an elementary exercise to show\nthat for the set \u00a3 the set of permutation covering sizes is precisely {nk,nk+u...}. Since \u00a3\ncomes from a superdiagonal matrix unit it follows that one of wu...,wk is a\nsuperdiagonal matrix unit in TmjcS. Its permutation covering sizes are ntj, mj+1,...,\nand so the desired conclusions follows. \u2022\nRemark. In each of the proofs above we have made key use of the fact that the\ntopologised fundamental relation R(A) is an invariant for isometric isomorphism and\nthat this topology detects the essential algebraic structure of the algebra. We remark\nthat if R(A) is viewed simply as a binary relation on a topological space, then it does\nnot determine isomorphism type. More precisely, there exist non isomorphic triangular\nsubalgebras A, A' of AF C*-algebras, with canonical subalgebras C, C, such that there\nexists a homeomorphism 6:M(C)-*M(C) with 9i2)(R(A)) = R(A'). To see this consider\nthe algebra Ao of compact operators on \/2(Z) which have upper triangular representing\nmatrices with respect to the standard bases {en:neZ}. Let P + , P_ be the orthogonal\nprojections onto \/2(Z+), \/2(Z_) respectively, where Z + and Z_ are the nonnegative and\nnegative integers, and let U be a partial isometry on Z2(Z) with initial space \/2(Z+) and\nfinal space \/2(Z_) such that Uen = eMn) for some bijection n:Z + -*Z_. Then the algebra\nA = A0 + CU, with A0 = CP+ + CP_ +A0, is a canonical triangular subalgebra of an AF\nC*-algebra. The fundamental relation, as a binary relation on the Gelfand space\nM(A n A*) = { \u2014 00} u l u { + 00}, is independent of the choice of n, and is simply the\ntotal order on Z together with the points ( \u2014 00, \u201400), ( \u2014 00, +00), ( + 00, +00). On the\notherhand it is straightforward to show that two such algebras, associated with n, n'\nsay, are isometrically isomorphic if and only if there is an integer j such that\nn(n) = n(n + j) for all large n in Z +.\nREFERENCES\n1.
