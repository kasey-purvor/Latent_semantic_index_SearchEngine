In this paper, a substantial set of simultaneous measurements of the sum of peroxy \nradicals, [HO2+RO2], NO3, hydrocarbons (HCs), and ozone, taken at Mace Head on the Atlantic \ncoast of Ireland in spring 1997, is presented. Conditions encountered uring the experiment ranged \nfrom semipolluted air masses advected from Britain and continental Europe to clean air masses off \nthe North and mid-Atlantic, where mixing ratios of pollution tracers approached Northern \nHemispheric background mixing ratios. Average mixing ratios of peroxy radicals varied from 2.5 to \n5.5 parts per trillion by volume (pptv) at night depending on wind sector, and were observed to \ndecay only very slowly from late afternoon toearly morning (0.1-0.5 pptv h-l). Measurements of OH \nand HO2 on two nights using the Fluorescence Assay by Gas Expansion (FAGE) technique give an \nupper limit for [OH] of 2.5xl O s molecules cm -3 and an average upper limit [HO2]\/[HO2+RO2] ratio \nof 0.27. A modeling study of the \u2022\/e lifetimes of the peroxy radicals, assuming o radical production \nat night, yielded mean lifetimes of between - 8-23 min for HO2 and 3-18 min for CH302. Given \nthese lifetimes, it may be concluded that the peroxy-radical mixing ratios observed could not be \nmaintained without substantial production at night. No significant correlation is observed between \nmeasured [HO\u2022+RO\u2022] and [NO3] under any conditions. Calculation of the reaction rates for ozone \nand NO3 with hydrocarbons (HCs) shows that the ozone-initiated oxidation routes of HCs \noutweighed those of NO3 in the NE, SE and NW wind sectors. In the SW sector, however, the two \nmechanisms operated at similar rates on average, and oxidation by NO3 was the dominant route in \nthe westerly sector. The oxidation of alkenes at night by ozone was greater by a factor of 4 than that \nby NO3 over the whole data set. The HC degradation rates from the three \"westerly\" sectors, where \ntracer mixing ratios were relatively low, may be representative ofthe nighttime oxidative capacity of \nthe marine boundary layer throughout the background Northern Hemisphere. Further calculations \nusing literature values for OH yields and inferred RO\u2022 yields from the ozone-alkene reactions how \nthat peroxy radicals derived from the ozone reactions were likely to make up the major part of the \nperoxy-radical signal at night (mean value 66%). However, the NO3 source was of similar \nmagnitude in the middle of the night, when [NO3] was generally at its maximum. The estimated total \nrates of formation of peroxy radicals are much higher under semipolluted conditions (mean 8.0xl 04 \nmolecules cm -3 s -\u2022 in the SE wind sector) than under cleaner conditions (mean 2.4x104 molecules \ncm '3 s -\u2022 in the westerly wind sector).

Introduction \nAlthough the hydroxyl radical (OH) is known to be the primary \ntropospheric oxidant in the daytime, there is mounting evidence in \nrecent years that significant oxidation of non-methane hydrocar- \nbons (NMHCs) can also occur at night in the lower atmosphere \n[e.g., Mihelcic et al., 1993; Hu and Stedman, 1995; Paulson and \nOrlando, 1996; Canttell et al., 1997; Carslaw et al., 1997]. One \nCopyright 2001 by the American Geophysical Union. \nPaper number 2000JD900754. \n0148-0227\/01\/2000JD900754509.00 \nspecies believed to be central to this nighttime chemistry is the \nnitrate radical (NO3), formed by the slow oxidation of NO2 by 03: \n(R1) NO2 + 03 --> NO3 + 02. \nNO3 absorbs strongly throughout he visible region of the spec- \ntrum, and is therefore rapidly photolyzed during the day; it is \nestimated to have a lifetime of just 5 s for overhead Sun and clear- \nsky conditions at sea level [Orlando et al., 1993]. At night, how- \never, NO3 can build up to significant mixing ratios via reaction \n(R1). NO3 reacts rapidly with unsaturated hydrocarbons, including \nbutenes, pentanes, and isoprene, as well as with reduced sulfur \ncompounds, such as dimethyl sulfide (DMS) [Wayne et al., 1991; \n12,669 \n12,670 SALISBURY ET AL.: PRODUCTION OF PEROXY RADICALS AT NIGHT \nR\u2022 \u2022R 3 \nR2 R 4 \nO2N * \nR\u2022 Rz'\u2022R3 R \nNO 3 \n. \n02NO \nR\u2022'\/\u2022 R \nR2 R3 \n02NO \nR2 R3 \nR4 \n02NO \nR\u2022'\/\u2022 R 4\nR2 R3 \n0 2 02NO 0 -'0' \nR\u2022'\u2022\u2022 R 4\nR\u2022 R\u2022 \nFigure 1.

Indeed, \nPenkerr et al. [1993] proposed that NO3 could have a significant \nimpact on the atmospheric lifetimes of many unsaturated hydro- \ncarbons throughout the Northern Hemispheric troposphere. \nPeroxy radicals can also be formed at night via the reactions of \nozone with alkenes [Hu and Stedman, 1995; Paulson and Or- \nlando, 1996; Paulson et al., 1999a, 1999b; Rickard et al., 1999]. \nOzone adds to the double bond of the alkene in a concerted proc- \ness, initially forming a primary ozonide (1,2,3-trioxolane), which \nrapidly decomposes to yield one or two carbonyl compounds and \nenergy-rich Criegee intermediates. The vibrationally excited \nCriegee intermediate can then either be collisionally stabilized by \na third body (M), or undergo unimolecular decomposition t  prod- \nucts. It is now widely believed that alkyl-substituted Criegee \nintermediates can decompose via a vibrationally hot hydroperox- \nide intermediate oyield an OH radical, along with another radical \nspecies of the general form R1R2C'C(O)R3, which is expected to \nreact rapidly with 02 to form a peroxy radical (RO2) [Martinez et \nal., 1981; Niki et al., 1987; Rathman et al., 1999]. The general \nmechanism isshown in schematic form in Figure 2a [after Rickard \net al., 1999], while the specific example of propene oxidation is \nshown in Figure 2b. Once formed, peroxy radicals undergo further \nchemistry, as exemplified by the methyl peroxy (CH302) radical: \n(R2) CH302 + NO --> CH30 + NO2 \n(R3) CH302 + NO3 --> CH30 + NO 2 + 02 \n(R4) CH302 + NO 2 + M <--> CH302NO 2 + M. \nThe methoxy (CH30) radical so formed then reacts with 02 to give \nHO2: \n(R5) CH30 + 02 -'> HO2 + HCHO. \nHO 2 reacts with both O3 and NOs to provide further outes to OH \nat night: \n(R6a) HO2 + NO3 --> OH + NO2 + M \n(R6b) --> HNO3 + 02 \n(R7) HO2 + 03 --> OH + 202. \nIt is worth noting here that NO3 acts both as an oxidant and as a \nchain carrier in nighttime chemistry, since its reactions with per- \noxy radicals lead to nighttime production of OH (reactions (R3), \n(RS), and (R6)). The other main loss reactions of peroxy radicals \nare their self- and cross-reactions to give peroxides and other oxy- \ngenated species: \n(RS) HO2 + HO2 \u2022> H202 + 02 \n(R9) CH302 + HO2 \u2022> CH3OOH + 02 \n(RlOa) CH302 + CH302 \u2022> 2CH30 + 02 \n(R10b) \n-> HCHO + CH3OH + 02 \n(R 10c) --> CH3OOCH 3 + 02 ' \nThere have been relatively few field studies of peroxy radicals \nat night. In the very clean, low-NOx atmosphere over the Southern \nOcean, Monks et al. [ 1996] observed only very low nighttime \nmixing ratios (-1 pptv) of peroxy radicals. The data could be ex- \nplained by the persistence into nighttime of CH302 radicals \nproduced during the day, with a calculated lifetime of over 12 \nhours. Mihelcic et al. [1993] reported the first simultaneous \nmeasurements of peroxy radicals and NO3 from Schauinsland, \nGermany, using the matrix-isolation electron-spin resonance (MI- \nESR) technique. NO3 and HO2 were found to be present in the \nrange of 0-10 pptv, while the sum of organic peroxy radicals \n(RO2) reached mixing ratios of up to 40 pptv; the data suggested \nan anticorrelation between NO3 and RO2 radical mixing ratios on \none night. The presence of unmeasured monoterpenes was pro- \nposed to explain the high RO2 and low NO3 mixing ratios, \nalthough the low NO3 lifetimes observed could have been due to \nheterogeneous lo ses or reaction with NO. Low nighttime mixing \nratios of peroxy radicals were observed by Canttell et al. [ 1992] \nduring the Rural Oxidants in the Southern Environment (ROSE) \nexperiment, although no conclusion was reached regarding the \nsource of the observed signal. In contrast, Cantrell et al. concluded \nthat the reaction of NO3 with DMS could be largely responsible \nfor the observed peroxy-radical signals at two sites where marine \nboundary layer air was frequently sampled, in Brittany [Canttell et \nal., 1996] and Mauna Loa [Canttell et al., 1997]. Carslaw et al. \n[ 1997] observed a positive correlation between NO3 and peroxy \nradicals measured at night at the coastal observatory in Wey- \nbourne on the east coast of England. NO3 reactions, particularly \nthat with DMS, were again concluded to be the major routes to \nperoxy-radical formation in the nighttime. \nConversely, Hu and Stedman [ 1995] suggested that reactions of \nozone with alkenes were largely responsible for peroxy radicals \nobserved at night in Denver, Colorado, in the summer of 1993, \nalthough no NOx or HC measurements were undertaken in this \nstudy. Paulson and Orlando [ 1996] used data from the ROSE \nexperiment to model the potential importance of the reactions of \n03 with alkenes as radical sources both during the day and at night \nat a rural site. More recently, Kanaya et al. [1999] observed - 3 \npptv of HO2 at night at Oki Island, Japan, and suggested that \nozone reactions with alkenes were more important for peroxy- \nradical production than NO3 reactions. A recent modeling study by \nAriya et al. [2000] also emphasized the possible importance of\nalkene ozonolysis reactions innighttime HOx production. \nSALISBURY ET AL.: PRODUCTION OF PEROXY RADICALS AT NIGHT 12,671 \nr\u2022.\u2022\/\u2022% + ; o\/O\"o %\/ \u2022 R,\u2022 03 R\u2022'\u2022\u2022% \nR2 \u2022 r,\u2022 \nPrimary Ozonide \nR (3 \/ M v Stabilization \nR' \ni ol \u00df R \/ R,\/\u2022O > Decomposition Pr ducts \nH H \u00df H H \no \nR R \nH . \n.\u2022 H \"'%O \nR \n[1] \n(0 5o) \n\u00df o-.-o \n\u2022 + 0 3 \n(b) \n02 \nH \u00df \nH\"\"%O + .OH \nH \nI decomposition \n\u2022 \u2022o. \n[B] \n0 65 \n0.35 \n.Xo. \n[C] \ndecomposition products \n(fragmentation) \ne.g. H20 -i- CO (0.38) \nH 2 + CO2 (0,13) \nHCO + OH (o.12-o.18) \ndecomposition products \n(fragmentation) \ne.g. CH 3 + CO 2 + H \nHCO + CH30 \nCH 4 + CO 2 \nO \n\u2022O \u2022O or \/\u2022O \u2022 \n(0.40) \n(o.,2) \n(o.17) \n(o.14) \nFigure 2.

Experiment \n2.1. Measurement Site \nThe Atmospheric Chemistry Studies in the Oceanic Environ- \nment (ACSOE) Eastern Atlantic Spring Experiment (EASE 97) \ntook place between April 28 and May 29, 1997, at the Mace Head \nAtmospheric Research Station, situated at 53.3 \u00f8 N, 9.9\u00f8W on the \nAtlantic coast of Ireland, 88 km west of Galway. The station con- \nsists of two sets of buildings: one at 100 m from the shoreline with \na 23 m tower for the air inlet of the ozone and carbon monoxide \n(CO) measurements; and another at 300 m from the shoreline at an \naltitude of 30 m above sea level [Carslaw et al., 1999a]. During \nthe campaign there was also a 10 m tower at the upper site, where \nthe inlet units for the NOx, NOy and Peroxy-Radical Chemical \nAmplification (PERCA) measurements (see section 2.2) were \nsituated, as well as a meteorological station at a height of 15 m \nabove the ground. A 10 m tower near the shore buildings provided \nan inlet for hydrocarbon sampling, adjacent to the Fluorescence \nAssay by Gas Expansion (FAGE) instrument, which sampled hy- \ndroxyl (OH) and hydroperoxy (HO2) radicals at 4.5 m above the \nground (see section 2.2). The Differential Optical Absorption \nSpectroscopy (DOAS) instrument for NO3 measurements was \nsituated at the near-shore site, with the retro-reflector array placed \non a small island 4.2 km to the west of the site [Allan et al., 2000]. \nA full site description, including photographs, is given by Cvita\u2022 \nand Kley [ 1994]. \n2.2. Measurement Techniques \nPeroxy radicals were measured by the chemical amplification \n(PERCA) technique, pioneered by Cantrell et al. [1984], using the \ninstrument described in detail by Clemitshaw et al. [1997] and \nMonks et al. [ 1998]. Briefly, the method relies upon the HO2 and \nOH radical catalyzed conversion of NO and CO into NO2 and \nCO2, respectively, namely, \n(R11) HO2 + NO --> OH + NO 2 \n(R12) OH + CO --> H + CO2 \n(R13) H + 02 + M --> HO2 + M. \nThe yield of both CO2 and NO2 is equal to CLN([HO2]+[OH]), \nwhere CLN, the chain length, is equal to the number of HO2\/OH \nradical interconversion cycles that occur before radical termina- \ntion. The NO2 yield of the PERCA instrument used during EASE \n97 is measured using a commercial Scintrex LMA-3 detector. \nSince the ratio [HO2]\/[OH] ranges from -50 to 200 in the atmos- \nphere, and many organic peroxy radicals are readily converted into \nHO 2 in the presence of NO, for example, CH302 via reactions (R2) \nand (R5), the PERCA technique effectively measures the sum of \nperoxy radicals. \n(R2) \n(R5) \nCH302 + NO --> CH30 + NO2 \nCH30 + 02 --> HO2 + HCHO. \nRecent work by Mihele and Hastie [1998] and Mihele et al. \n[ 1999] has shown that the chain length of a chemical amplifier is \nreduced in the presence of atmospheric water vapor. This effect \nhas also been observed in the instrument used in this work (G. \nSalisbury et al., unpublished results, 2000). However, the specific \nhumidity observed during the night at Mace Head during EASE 97 \nwas fairly uniform, with a mean value of 6.7 g kg -\u2022 and a standard \ndeviation ofonly 0.1 g kg '\u2022 (<2%). It is likely therefore that any \nmeasurement error due to the CLN-humidity effect would be sys- \ntematically present throughout the data set used in the present \nwork. For a 1 hour average the detection limit of the PERCA in- \nstrument varied between 0.6 and 1.0 pptv, depending on the CLN \n(measured periodically throughout he campaign) and the stability \nof the background NO2 signal. The instrument accuracy (neglect- \ning the humidity effect) was estimated to be +30%, with a \nprecision of 15% [Clemitshaw et al., 1997]. \nIn addition to the PERCA measurements, OH and HO2 were \nmeasured sequentially on two nights using the FAGE technique, \nwith the instrument described and characterized by Creasey et al. \n[1997]. Further details of the deployment of this instrument in \nEASE 97 are given by N. Carslaw et al. (Modeling the concentra- \ntions of OH, HO2, and RO2 during the EASE 97 campaign, 1, \nComparison with measurements, ubmitted to dournal of Geo- \nphysical Research - Atmospheres, 2001, hereinafter eferred to as \nCarslaw et al., submitted paper, 2001). During EASE 97 the detec- \ntion limits for the FAGE instrument were 0.02 pptv for OH and \n0.1 pptv for HO2 (150 s averages, signal-to-noise ratio equal to 1). \nThe overall l c\u2022 uncertainty for a 150 s average measurement was \nestimated to be 20% for OH and 25% for HO2 (Carslaw et al., \nsubmitted paper, 2001). \nThe nitrate radical (NO3) was measured using the DOAS tech- \nnique, as described by Allan et al. [1999, 2000], with a mean lc\u2022 \nuncertainty of +15% (1 hour average). Hydrocarbons (HCs), for- \nmaldehyde (HCHO), and dimethyl sulfide (DMS) were measured \nby in situ gas chromatographic techniques, as described by Lewis \net al. [ 1996, 1997, 1999] and Grenfell et al. [ 1999], with 1 c\u2022 uncer- \ntainties of +5-10% (1 hour average), depending on mixing ratio. \nOzone measurements were made using a commercial UV ()\u2022 = 254 \nnm) spectrometer, as described by Derwent et al. [1994], with an \nestimated accuracy of +5%. NOx was measured using commercial \nCRANOX (Ecophysics) instrumentation, as described by \nCc\u2022rdenas et al. [1998]; in addition, more sensitive NO measure- \nments were made using an instrument designed and built at the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Aer- \nonomy Laboratory and described by Carpenter et al. [2000]. The \nlatter instrument was also used to measure NO2 and NOy. The \naccuracy of the latter set of NOx measurements has been estimated \nby Carpenter et al. [2000] to be +13% for NO and +33% for NO2 \n(for ambient levels of 50 pptv and 150 pptv, respectively). Carbon \nmonoxide, methane, and other tracers are measured routinely at \nthe station, as described by Cvita$ and Kley [ 1994]. \n2.3. Data Analysis \nIn order to examine the nighttime chemistry occurring indiffer- \ning air masses observed atMace Head during the campaign, the \ndata from EASE 97 were divided up according towind direction \nas measured at the site. Previous work at Mace Head has shown \nthat the site regularly receives relatively clean air masses from \nsoutherly latitudes, the mid-Atlantic, and the Arctic, as well as \nmore polluted air masses advected from Britain and continental \nEurope [Simmonds et al., 1997]. Five wind sectors were chosen \nfor the analysis: northeasterly (NE), 0\u00f8-90\u00f8; southeasterly (SE), \n90\u00f8-200\u00f8; southwesterly (SW), 200\u00f8-250\u00f8; westerly (W), 250 \u00f8- \n300\u00f8; and northwesterly (NW), 300\u00f8-360 \u00f8 (Figure 3).

Map of Ireland, showing the location of the Mace Head \nAtmospheric Research Station, superimposed with the wind sec- \ntors used in the data analysis. \nof local sea\/coast breezes were removed from the analysis by se- \nlecting data only where the local wind speed was over 3 m s -\u2022 [cf. \nCape et al., 2000]. Hourly averaged data points of all variables \nwere allocated to a wind sector if the wind direction indicated 45 \nor more minutes' worth of data (75 + %) within that sector for a \ngiven hour. Hours in which there was no dominant sector by this \ncriterion were rejected. The hourly averaged data points were then \nused to derive averaged nighttime profiles over the whole cam- \npaign for each wind sector. In this work, the nighttime period is \ndefined using the criterion of nonzero [NO3], and hence usually \nextends from 1900 to 0600. This criterion was chosen in prefer- \nence to a strict definition based on solar zenith angles reaching 85 \u00f8 \nor 90 \u00f8 because the possible sources of peroxy radicals in the early \nmorning and late evening are also generally poorly understood. \nTable 1 shows the average nighttime mixing ratios of selected \nspecies during EASE 97 by wind sector derived using this method. \nTable 2 shows the average nighttime alkene mixing ratios by wind \nsector measured during EASE 97. The alkene measurements are \ndiscussed in detail by Lewis et al. [ 1999]. Nevertheless, it is worth \nnoting here that the alkene mixing ratios were generally lower in \nthe \"clean\" wind sectors (SW, westerly and NW) than for the rela- \ntively polluted NE and SE sectors (Table 2), as would be expected \nfrom the oceanic origins of the air masses. Ethene, propene, and 2- \nmethylpropene levels, however, remained significant even in clean \nmarine air. Lewis et al. [ 1999] proposed that these species had \nemission sources from coastal waters local to Mace Head, via \nphotodegradation f organic carbon in seawater. \n2.4. Modeling \nTwo modeling studies were performed in support of the ex- \nperimental data analysis in the course of this work. First, a simple \nzero-dimensional analysis of nighttime peroxy-radical lifetimes \nwas performed for the average conditions observed in each wind \nsector, using the reaction scheme shown in Table 3. This method \nwas employed in preference to estimations of peroxy-radical ife- \ntimes by direct calculation, as peroxy radicals can be destroyed by \nvarious routes, including reaction with NO, NO3, and 03 (HO2 \nonly), as well as by the peroxy-radical self- and cross-reactions \n(compare with reactions (R2)-(Rll)). Model runs were con- \nstrained by average measurements of NO, NO2, 03, NO3, \ntemperature, and humidity in each sector, but no hydrocarbons \nwere included. Runs were initialized with various proportions of \nHO2 and CH302, so that their sum equaled the average [HO2+RO2] \nmeasured for that wind sector. [NO] and [NO3] were kept constant \nin each run. For the purposes of this work, RO2 radicals other than \nCH302 were assumed to behave as CH302. The aim was simply to \ncalculate radical lifetimes for each set of conditions, assuming no \nradical production at night. The lifetimes so obtained (defined for \nthe purposes of this work as the time taken for the radicals to fall \nto \u2022\/e of their initial mixing ratio) could be compared with the \nTable 1.

[1990a, 1990b], the chemical \nmechanisms and rate coefficients for all species were taken from a \nMaster Chemical Mechanism (MCM) devised by denkin et al. \n[ 1997]. In total, 1646 reactions and 488 species were included. In \nthis work, the CTBM was used to provide a case study of the \nnighttime chemistry of May 1-3 (days of year 121-123), a semi- \npolluted episode with winds almost entirely from the SE sector \n(93.5%). During this period, NO,, and HC mixing ratios were rela- \ntively high, and the nighttime chemistry was consequently \nrelatively complex. The model uncertainties in [HO2+RO2] were \nestimated to be +14% (1(\u2022) for these conditions [Carslaw et al., \n1999b]. The FACSIMILE numerical integration package [AEA \nTechnology, 1995] was employed for both sets of simulations. \n3. Results \n3.1. PERCA Measurements and Modeled Peroxy-Radical \nLifetimes \nFigure 4 shows the averaged peroxy-radical data obtained for \nthe SE wind sector in EASE 97. The daytime maximum was not at \nsolar noon, as found under relatively unpolluted conditions [e.g., \nMonks et al., 2000], but rather midafternoon (Figure 4a). This was \nprobably due to relatively elevated NO levels in the morning (not \nshown in Figure 4), which acted to suppress peroxy-radical mixing \nratios (reactions (R2) and (Rll)), as well as likely enhanced per- \noxy-radical production from sources other than ozone photolysis \nin the afternoon, for example, formaldehyde photolysis. Space \ndoes not permit full discussion of these observations here, but case \nstudies of a particular polluted day during the Eastern Atlantic \nSummer Experiment at Mace Head in 1996 (EASE 96) are given \n12,676 SALISBURY ET AL.'

Monks et al. (The role of per- \noxy radicals and isoprene in the production of ozone in continental \noutflow, submitted to Atmospheric Environment, 2000). As a re- \nsult of this \"delayed\" maximum in photochemical ctivity, the \nperoxy-radical mixing ratios were still relatively high in the late \nafternoon (Figure 4b). After dropping off rapidly between 1600 \nand 1900 hours, the peroxy-radical mixing ratios stabilized, even \nincreased slightly, between 1900 and 2200 hours, and then de- \ncreased only slowly through the night, at a mean rate of-\u20220.5 pptv \nh 4 (from Figure 4b). The average modeled peroxy-radical life- \ntimes at night for the SE sector were 5.4 min for HO2 (range 2.0- \n11.5 min, depending on HO2\/CH302 ratio) and 3.0 (2.9-3.0) min \nfor CH302. In the absence of nighttime production of peroxy radi- \ncals, therefore, significant mixing ratios of peroxy radicals could \nnot be maintained throughout the night under these conditions, but \nwould rapidly fall below the detection limit of the PERCA instru- \nment. The combination of the sustained peroxy-radical mixing \nratios measured and the calculated lifetimes can be taken as evi- \ndence that the peroxy radicals observed during the night were not \nsimply those remaining from daytime photochemistry. \nIn contrast, Figure 5 shows the analogous plots for the westerly \nwind sector. Figure 5a shows the full diel cycle for peroxy radicals \nand j(NO2), where the approximately symmetrical rise and fall of \nperoxy radicals about the solar maximum may be clearly ob- \nserved. Figure 5b shows the composite nighttime profile obtained \nfor this sector. Note first that the general peroxy- and nitrate- \nradical mixing ratios were substantially lower than for the SE sec- \ntor (see also Table 1). The mean nighttime ozone mixing ratio was \nalso significantly lower. These results are not surprising given the \nlikely mid-Atlantic origin of the air masses sampled, where NO,, \nSALISBURY ET AL.: PRODUCTION OF PEROXY RADICALS AT NIGHT 12,677 \nTable 4.

Again, this represents indirect evidence for peroxy- \nradical production at night, even under the relatively clean condi- \ntions of the westerly wind sector, albeit at much lower mixing \nratios than under more polluted conditions. \nSimilar results were obtained for the other three wind sectors. \nTable 4 gives the modeled peroxy-radical ifetimes obtained for \neach sector, using both the mean measured NO mixing ratios and \nwith [NO] set to zero. This dual procedure was adopted because \nthere is ongoing controversy on the feasibility of nonzero [NO] at \nnight in the presence of ozone: since k(r=285 K)(NO+O3) = 1.5 x 10' \n\u20224 cm 3 molecule-\u2022 s-\u2022 [DeMote t al., 1997], the \u2022\/e lifetime of NO \nfor [03] = 35 ppbv is calculated to be- 77 s. The NO detection \nlimit of the UEA NOxy instrument is estimated to be- 4 pptv \n[Carpenter et al., 2000]. Inspection of Table 1 shows that mean \n[NO] for the westerly, NW, and SW sectors was approximately at \nthe detection limit (4 pptv), whereas mean [NO] for the NE and \nSE sectors was above the detection limit (6 and 14 pptv, respec- \ntively). It must be remembered that these mean values extend \ntoward dawn and dusk, where some NO2 photolysis to yield NO \noccurs. If these data are excluded, the mean [NO] values become \n4, 8, 2, 4, and 2 pptv for the NE, SE, SW, westerly, and NW sec- \ntors, respectively. The model lifetime runs were intended to en- \ncompass the possible upper and lower limits for [NO], and the \ninfluence of such a range of [NO] values on peroxy-radical life- \ntimes at night. \nAlso included in Table 4 are the mean peroxy-radical decay \nrates observed from the five sets of experimental data. It is worth \nnoting that the lowest modeled lifetimes were observed in the SE \nsector, where [NOx] was highest. The CH302 lifetimes for the \nthree \"westerly\" sectors (SW, westerly, and NW) were all quite \nsimilar, at around 12-18 min. Setting NO to zero in the lifetime \nmodels generally left the HO2 lifetimes relatively unchanged, but \ngreatly increased the CH302 lifetimes (Table 4). This was due to \nthe relatively slow self-reaction of CH302, as well as the fact that \nHO 2 is also destroyed by reaction with ozone (reaction (R7)). \nNevertheless, the CH302 \u2022\/e lifetimes were still all less than 3 \nhours (Table 4). If [NO3] was also set to zero, the mean lifetimes \nfor the NE sector became 8.5 (range 7.2-11.9) min for HO2 and 4+ \n(3.8-12+) hours for CH302. These results how the importance of \nNO3 to the processing of organic peroxy radicals at night, when \nNO is absent or at very low mixing ratios (compare with reaction \n(R3) CH302 + NO3 \u2022> CH30 + NO 2 + 02 \n(R5) CH30 + 02 \u2022> HCHO + HO 2 \nFor 5 pptv NO3, however, inspection of the T = 298 K rate coeffi- \ncients kNo+ci-i3o2 = 7.3x10 -\u20222 cm 3 molecule -\u2022 s '\u2022 [DeMote t al., \n1997] and kNo3+c\u2022302- 1.0x10 -\u20222 cm 3 molecule '\u2022 s '\u2022 [Mellouki et \nal., 1993] shows that only 0.7 pptv NO is required for the CH30 2 \n--} HO2 conversion rates to be equal via the two routes. \nIn summary, slow net decay of peroxy-radical mixing ratios \nwas observed uring the night for the whole data set classified by \nwind sector: the observed decay rates (Table 4) imply \u2022\/e lifetimes \nof 34.7, 6.6, 11.4, 16.1, and 5.9 hours (mean 14.9 hours) for per- \noxy radicals in the five wind sectors NE, SE, SW, westerly, and \nNW, respectively. Conversely, the modeled peroxy-radical \u2022\/e \nlifetimes using average measured [NO], which take into account \nall the known loss reactions for peroxy radicals, were less than 1 \nhour for all wind sectors. Even with [NO] set o zero, the average \nHO2 lifetimes were only 8.0-22.6 min, while the average CH302 \nlifetimes were all <3 hours. In the absence ofperoxy-radical pro- \nduction at night, therefore, the peroxy-radical mixing ratios would \nfall below the detection limit of the PERCA instrument in the \ncourse of the night. This shows that the peroxy radicals observed \nat night during EASE 97 were not simply those remaining from \ndaytime photochemistry. I  may be inferred, therefore, that peroxy \nradicals were produced insignificant mixing ratios at night during \nEASE 97. \n3.2. FAGE HO2 and OH Measurements \nFAGE HO2 and OH data were also available for two nights \nduring EASE 97. On the night of May 1-2, the HO2 mixing ratios \nvaried between \u2022 1-2 pptv (hourly averages), giving an average \n12,678 SALISBURY ET AL.'

This is in reasonable agreement \nwith the model results from the CTBM (see section 4.2), where the \nCH302 radical was found to be the highest contributor to the total \nperoxy-radical population (- 40%), followed by HO2 ('\u2022 30%). \nThe other night on which HO2 was measured was May 21-22, \nwhere [HO2] varied between 0.5 and 0.7 pptv, and the \n[HO2]\/[HO2+RO2] ratio was lower throughout, with an average \nvalue of 0.18. The wind through most of this night was from the \nNW sector, where CH302 would be expected to dominate the per- \noxy-radical population still further [Jacobs, 2000]. The HO2 \nmeasurements are plotted with the PERCA [HO2+RO2] measure- \nments in Figures 6a (May 1-2) and 6b (May 21-22). The mean \n[HO2]\/[HO2+RO2] ratio over both nights was 0.27; it must be re- \nmembered, however, that the effect of humidity on the PERCA \nmeasurements during EASE 97 (G. Salisbury et al., unpublished \nresults, 2000) means that the ratios calculated here should be con- \nsidered as upper limits. Nevertheless, the FAGE HO2 \nmeasurements represent clear evidence that the peroxy radicals \nobserved at night during EASE 97 were not simply CH302 radi- \ncals remaining from daytime photochemistry [cf. Monks et al., \n1996]. \nOH measurements were made over the same two nights as HO2 \n(May 1-2 and 21-22). On neither night were OH mixing ratios \nabove the detection limit observed.

Discussion \n4.1. Peroxy-Radical Production at Night \nAs outlined in the Introduction, two mechanisms are known to \nproduce peroxy radicals in the absence of photochemistry, namely, \nthe reactions of (1) the nitrate radical and (2) ozone with unsatu- \nrated HCs. The nitrate radical reacts with alkenes via addition of \nNO3 to the double bond, followed by recombination with 02 to \ngive a peroxy radical (Figure 1 [after Wayne et al., 1991]). Ozone \nalso adds to the double bond of alkenes, yielding one or two car- \nbonyl compounds and energy-rich Criegee biradical intermediates. \nThe latter species can then either be collisionally stabilized by a \nthird body (M), or undergo unimolecular decomposition to prod- \nucts. It is now widely believed that alkyl-substituted Criegee \nintermediates can decompose via a vibrationally hot hydroperox- \nide intermediate to yield an OH radical, along with another adical \nspecies of the general form R1R2C'C(O)R3, which is expected to \nreact rapidly with 02 to form a peroxy radical (RO2) [Martinez et \nal., 1981; Niki et al., 1987; Rathman et al., 1999]. The general \nmechanism isshown in schematic form in Figure 2a. The yield of \nOH and RO 2 depends on the structure of the alkene [Paulson and \nOrlando, 1996; Paulson et al., 1997, 1999a, 1999b; Rickard et al., \n1999]; the specific example of propene oxidation by ozone is \nshown in Figure 2b, as it is an important reaction in the present \nstudy (Table 2). The major peroxy radical produced is likely to be \nHC(O)CH202 (pathway 1 in Figure 2b), which is expected to rap- \nidly generate HO2 in the presence of NO (compare with reactions \n(R2) and (R5)) [Paulson et al., 1999b]. The OH produced in the \nozone-alkene r actions will then react with a range of organic \ncompounds to yield peroxy radicals, similar to the daytime proc- \nesses. The reactions of NO3 and 03 with alkanes and carbonyl \ncompounds are relatively slow [Atkinson, 1994], and therefore \nunlikely to contribute significantly to the total peroxy-radical pro- \nduction. However, the reactions of NO3 with CH 4 and HCHO are \nconsidered in this work owing to the relatively high mixing ratios \nof these species under the conditions encountered. \nFigure 7 shows a scatterplot f measured [HO2+RO2] versus \n[NO3], where each data-point is a composite wind sector hour, \nwith all sectors plotted together as one series. Clearly, there is no \nsignificant correlation between the two variables (r2 = 0.002). \nSimilar results were obtained both by plotting all hourly data ob- \ntained during the campaign without sorting by wind sector, and by \nplotting each wind sector separately. This is in contrast with the \nresults obtained by Carslaw et al. [ 1997], where a positive correla- \ntion was observed between HO2+RO2 and NO3 at the Weybourne \nAtmospheric Observatory in Norfolk, England. However, the lack \nof correlation is not surprising, given that NO3 is both a source \n[Wayne t al., 1991] and sink [Mellouki et al., 1993; Biggs et al., \n1994] of peroxy radicals. An analogous plot of all nighttime [HO2] \nmeasurements versus [NO3] (not shown) also showed no signifi- \ncant correlation. \nIn order to ascertain the sources of the observed peroxy radi- \ncals, total rates (cp) were calculated for the reactions of NO3 and \n03 with those alkenes measured uring EASE 97, namely, ethene, \npropene, 2-methylpropene, but-l-ene, cis- and trans-but-2-ene, \ncis- and trans-pent-2-ene, 1,3-butadiene, and isoprene (equations \n(1) and (2)). \nalk \ncI) NO3 = Z kNo 3 +alk\/[NO3 ][alki ] (1) \ni \nalk \nCI)o3 = Z kO3+alki [03 ][alki] (2) \ni \nThe rate coefficients used in the NO3 calculations were taken from \nAtkinson [1994]. Values for the pentenes were unavailable; aver- \naged values were therefore calculated according to the procedure \nadopted by denkin et al. [1997]. The rate coefficients for the 03 \nreactions were taken from Atkinson [ 1997] where available; the \nrate coefficients used for the pentenes were averages calculated \nafter denkin et al. [ 1997]. Uncertainties on the total rates for each \nmechanism were estimated using the measurement uncertainties \ngiven in section 2.2 and literature l c\u2022 uncertainties for the rate \ncoefficients [Atkinson, 1991, 1994, 1997], where available. Uncer- \ntainties for the remaining rate coefficients were taken as averages \nof the published cases. \nFigure 8 shows a correlation plot of the total rate through the \nNO3 and 03 reactions with alkenes versus the measured sum of \nperoxy radicals, [HO2 + RO2], where the data for all wind sectors \nare plotted as a single series.

Table 5 \nshows that the ozone reactions dominated the nighttime oxidation \nof alkenes over the whole data set (average contribution - 80%). \nIn terms of the overall oxidation of alkenes at Mace Head, the \nO3+alkene rates are significant, even when compared with daytime \nOH+alkene oxidation rates: for example, the SE value of 8.3x10 4 \nmolecules cm -3 s -1 may be compared to an average daytime \nOH+alkene rate of 2.8x105 molecules cm -3 s 'l (for integrated [OH] \n= 1x106 molecules cm'3). The 24 hour averages (assuming zero \n[OH] at night; not shown i  Table 5) are 1.1x105 and 1.5x10 s \nmolecules cm '3 s -], respectively. Also included inthe table are the \nmean rates for the NO3+CH4 and NO3+DMS reactions for com- \nparison. The final two columns in the table give the percentage \ncontributions of NO3 and 03 reactions to the total nighttime oxida- \ntion of HCs (including DMS) at Mace Head. Table 5 shows that \nthe 03 reactions dominated the NO3 reactions in the NE, SE, and \nNW wind sectors. In the SW sector the contributions of the two \nmechanisms to HC oxidation were comparable, whereas in the \nwesterly sector the NO3 reactions were dominant. From the data \nin Table 5 it can also be seen that total oxidation rates were higher \nfor the NE and SE sectors than for the westerly, SW, and NW \nsectors. This would be expected, given the generally lower NOx \nand HC mixing ratios in the \"westerly\" air masses at Mace Head. \nThis trend is in qualitative agreement with the peroxy-radical mix- \ning ratios observed in the five wind sectors (Table 1). \nTable 5 also shows that the mean rate through the NO3+DMS \nreaction was comparable to the mean total rate through the reac- \nTable 5.

The chemistry of NO3 during EASE \n97 is dealt with in full by Allan et al. [2000], but these results \nshow once more the importance of even small amounts of DMS in \ncontrolling NO3 levels in the marine boundary layer [Yvon et al., \n1996; Carslaw et al., 1997; Allan et al., 1999, 2000]. The \nNO3+DMS reaction alone accounts for-14, 18, 33, 44, and 19% \nof the total HC oxidation at night in the NE, S E, SW, westerly, \nand NW wind sectors, respectively. It is also interesting to com- \npare the rate through the NO3+CH4 and NO3+HCHO reactions \nwith the total rate through the NO3+HC reactions. The methane \nreaction (see Table 5) is seen to have been insignificant in the NE \nand SE sectors, but represented up to 11% of the NO3+HC oxida- \ntion rate in the three \"westerly\" sectors, where mixing ratios of \nHCs other than DMS were generally lower. The NO3 reaction with \n}tCHO (not shown in Table 5) was found to be relatively unim- \nportant in all sectors, with a maximum rate of only 9.1x102 \nmolecules cm '3 s -\u2022 (SE sector). \nIn order to assess the relative peroxy-radical production from \nNO3 and 03 reactions with alkenes, it is necessary to consider the \nreaction mechanisms in more detail. It is assumed here that each \nmolecule of alkene (and CH4) reacted with NO3 yields one peroxy \nradical (Figure 1 [after Wayne et al., 1991]); that is, \nP(HO 2 + RO 2)NO3 = (I)No 3 , (3) \nwhere P denotes the rate of production of radicals. The only ex- \nception to this is the NO3 reaction with DMS, which yields the \nCH3SCH202 peroxy radical initially. However, this species is not \nbelieved to be detectable by the PERCA technique; during a \nmeasure\u2022nent campaign at Weybourne, England, in 1994, Carslaw \net al. [1997] measured an average [HO2+RO2] of only 1.3 pptv on \na night where the modeled [CH3SCH202] was almost 23 pptv. The \nNO\u2022+DMS reaction is therefore neglected in the following analy- \nsis. \nAs already mentioned, the yield of OH (and hence RO2) froIn \nthe reactions of ozone with alkenes varies according to the struc- \nture of the alkene [Paulson and Orlando, 1996; Paulson et al., \n1997, 1999a, 1999b; Rickard e! al., 1999]. Table 6 shows the OH \nyields measured by various workers for the alkenes measured in \nEASE 97; the average values have been used in this study. Also \nincluded in Table 6 are the rate coefficients used for the reactions \nand their source. Since OH produces a second peroxy radical on \nreaction with the most abundant trace species, CO and CH 4 (as \nwell as NMHCs), the effective peroxy-radical yield is estimated to \nbe twice the OH yield for each alkene; that is, \nalk \nP(HO 2 + RO2)o3 = ZkO3+alk.[O3][alki]2YoH., (4) 1 I \nwhere YoH represents he OH yield from a given O3-alkene reac- \ntion. Figure 2b shows the full reaction scheme for the reaction \nbetween ozone and propene, with estimated branching ratios as \ngiven by Atkinson [ 1997], except for the stabilized Criegee biradi- \ncal branching ratios [Rickard et al., 1999]; in addition, the syn- \nand anti-CH3CHO0* are assumed to be formed in equal amounts. \nFigure 2b shows that the calculation used in this work is a simpli- \nfication, since OH and peroxy radicals may be produced via \npathways not considered in equation (4). The total HO2+RO2 yield \nestimated from Figure 2b, assuming all OH formed goes on to \nreact with CO or CH 4 to produce a peroxy radical, is - 96%. Nev- \nertheless, 69% of the total yield is estimated to be due to the decay \nof the syn-CH3CHO0* Criegee biradical (species A in Figure 2b) \nvia a vibrationally hot hydroperoxide (pathway 1 in Figure 2b). \nHence equation (4) may be taken to represent a reasonable ower \nlimit fbr the peroxy-radical yield for the ozone-propene r action, \nand, by analogy, the other ozone-alkene r actions considered here. \nOther possible routes to peroxy radicals have not been considered \nfhrther in the calculations presented in this section. \nThe assumption that all OH radicals formed in the reactions of \nozone with alkenes react further to produce peroxy radicals was \nexamined by calculating reactivity indices for the major loss reac- \ntions of OH. The reactions considered were as follows: \n(R\u20222) OH + CO-\u2022\u00f82 M > HO 2 + CO 2 \n(\u2022,\u2022 4) Ott + CH4 ---\u00f82 M >CHaO2 + 1t20 \n(R\u20225) OH + NO2 + M --> HNO3 + M. \nNMHCs were not included in this simple analysis.

The error bars are estimated 1 (x uncertainties. \nrate (not included in Figure 9) was found to be insignificant inthis \nsector (Table 5). The situation in the westerly sector was more \ncomplex. The high production from ozone reactions atthe begin- \nning of the composite night is because ofhigh ozone mixing ratios \non one particular night (day of year 137): the low level of chemi- \ncal activity during the latter part of the night would appear to be \nmore characteristic of clean air masses off the mid-Atlantic. Inter- \nestingly, for this sector amuch igher relative contribution f NO3 \nchemistry isobserved, particularly when the NO3 + CH4 reaction \nis also considered. This is reflected inTable 5, where the westerly \nsector shows the highest contribution of NO3 to HC oxidation over \nthe whole night. \nFigure 10 summarizes the estimated mean peroxy-radical pro- \nduction rates for the five wind sectors. The error bars in Figure 10 \nrepresent mean 1\u2022 uncertainties in the production rates for the \nwhole data set (19% for the ozone reactions; 25% for the nitrate- \nradical reactions). The total O3+alkene reaction rates are included \nfor comparison with those using the projected RO2 yields for each \nreaction. The NO3 data include the reaction with methane, which \nwas found to be important in the westerly, SW, and NW sectors. \nFigure 10 highlights he difference between considering the over- \nall HC oxidation at night, where O3 generally predominated, as \nopposed to the relative contributions to peroxy radicals observable \nby the PERCA technique, where the NO3 contribution was higher \nin comparison, although usually still outweighed bythe O3 contri- \nbution. NO3 reactions made the highest relative contribution to the \nPERCA signal in the westerly sector (see Figure 9b). Figure 11 \nshows the estimated percentage contributions to the PERCA signal \nthroughout the night for all wind sectors. Figure 1 la shows the \nvalues for each wind sector, while Figure 1 lb shows the overall \naverage contributions by hour. Figure 11 shows that the O3 contri- \nbution was always at least equal to that of NO3, and generally \ngreater, apart from in the middle of the night, when NO3 mixing \nratios were highest. It is worth noting that the two sets of reactions \ncontributed almost equally to the PERCA signal in the central \nportion of the night, since previous workers have tended to con- \nclude that either NO3 or O3 reactions are dominant (see Figure \n12). \nNevertheless, over the whole nighttime period it is clear that \nthe greater contribution to production of the peroxy radicals ob- \nserved at night during EASE 97 was from the reactions of ozone \nwith alkenes (--- 66% on average over the whole data set). Cer- \ntainly, the contribution of the nitrate radical to the initiation of \nnighttime oxidation of alkenes would appear to be significantly \nsmaller than that of ozone (on average, - 20% versus 80%, respec- \ntively, see Table 5). The low HC reaction rates in the three \n\"westerly\" sectors, where pollution tracers were at relatively low \nmixing ratios, may be representative of the oxidative capacity of \nthe nighttime marine boundary layer throughout the background \nNorthern Hemisphere. Conversely, the rates calculated for the \nsemipolluted sectors may be underestimates, since higher chain- \nlength alkenes were not measured in EASE 97, but are believed to \nbe present in significant mixing ratios in the semipolluted conti- \nnental boundary layer [Lewis et al., 2000]. \n4.2. Campaign-Tailored Box Model Results \nQualitative supporting evidence for the conclusion that ozone \nchemistry was the dominant source for the nighttime peroxy radi- \ncals observed uring EASE 97 was obtained from a model study \nutilizing a campaign-tailored box model (CTBM). The ozone- \nalkene reaction mechanisms used in the model did not include the \ndecay of the syn Criegee biradical intermediates (such as syn- \nCH3CHOO*, species A in Figure 2b) via a vibrationally hot hy- \ndroperoxide intermediate to yield OH and RO2 (see pathway 1 in \nFigure 2b) [denkin et al., 1997]. However, the overall OH yields \nemployed were similar to those used in the calculations of section \n4.1. To use the example of propene, the CTBM model used an OH \nyield of 36%, while the total HO2+RO2 yield was calculated to be \n92% (assuming that all OH forms peroxy radicals on further eac- \ntion; see section 4.1), which is in excellent agreement with the \ntotal estimated from Figure 2b (96%). The yield of the \nCH3CHOO* biradical was assumed to be 0.5 in the CTBM. The \nOH and peroxy-radical forming routes used in the CTBM were \nfrom (1) the decay of CH3CHOO* via species B in Figure 2b: OH \nyield 0.18, HO2 yield 0.10, CH302 yield 0.28; (2) the decay of the \n12,684 SALISBURY ET AL.'

The average \nmeasured NO level during the hours of complete darkness (- 2030 \n-0445) during this period was -\u2022 9 pptv. In order to assess the im- \npact of different possible NO mixing ratios on the nighttime \nchemistry, a sensitivity analysis was carried out, running the \nmodel with 0, 1, 5, and 10 pptv of NO present. Figure 13 shows \nthe percentage contributions to OH, CH302, and HO2 formation \nfor [NO] = 10 pptv. Figure 13a shows that the main routes to OH \nformation were secondary processes, involving reactions of HO2, \nwith the major source being the reaction of HO2 with 03. The only \nimportant primary source from HC reaction was via the decompo- \nsition of the Criegee biradical, CH3CHOO* (species A in Figure \n2b), formed from the reactions of ozone with propene, cis-but-2- \nene, trans-but-2-ene, cis-pent-2-ene, and trans-pent-2-ene. Figure \n13b shows that the highest contributions to CH302 formation were \nthe decomposition of the Criegee biradical, CH3CHOO*, and the \nSALISBURY ET AL.: PRODUCTION OF PEROXY RADICALS AT NIGHT 12,685 \nAlkenes, CH 4 \nAlkenes \n+ 0 3 \n+ 0 3 \n+ NO3, 0 2 \n+ N% \nHO 2 L \n+ % :\u2022 + O\u2022, N% \nHNO3 \n+ 0 2 \n+ 0 2 \n+ 0 2 \nNMHCs \nFigure 12.

Figure 13c shows that HO2 formation \nwas dominated by reactions of OH, largely the reaction with CO. \nThe second highest contribution was found to be through reaction \nof the CH30 radical, itself formed from CH302 reaction with NO \nor NO3, with 02. \nIn terms of primary production from HC oxidation, it is clear \nthat the ozone reactions predominated as sources of OH and the \nmajor peroxy radicals HO2 and CH302 during this period. The \nmain qualitative difference observed in raising the NO level from \n0 to 10 pptv was found to be the increased recycling of HO2 to \nOH. This in turn increased the relative contribution of the \nOH+CH4 reaction to CH302 formation. The relative contributions \nto HO2 formation were largely unchanged. In quantitative terms, \nthe overall formation rates of the three radicals increased markedly \nfor increased NO, but this was largely due to increased cycling \nbetween the three radical species; the primary formation routes \nwere unaffected by the NO level. This was to be expected, since \nNO does not participate in the radical formation reactions. \n5. Conclusions \nIn this paper we have presented an extensive set of simultane- \nous measurements of peroxy radicals, HO2+RO2, NO3, HCs and \nozone. No correlation was observed between either [HO2+RO2] or \n[HO2] alone with [NO3], which underlines the fact that peroxy \nradicals are both formed by NO3 reactions [Wayne et al., 1991] \nand destroyed by reaction with NO3 [e.g., Mellouki et al., 1993]. \nThis result is in contrast with Mihelcic et al. [ 1993], who observed \na negative correlation between [HO2+RO2] and [NO3] at \nSchauinsland in Germany, and Carslaw et al. [1997], who ob- \nserved a positive correlation between [HO2+RO2] and [NO3] at \nWeybourne on the east coast of England. \nThe sustained mixing ratios of peroxy radicals observed at \nnight (net decay rates of <0.5 pptv h '\u2022 in all wind sectors) demon- \nstrated a requirement for substantial production processes in the \nabsence of daytime photochemistry. In support of this finding, the \naverage modeled lifetimes of HO2 and RO2 (where CH302 was \ntaken to represent all RO2 present) were all less than 1 and 3 \nhours, respectively, even with [NO] set to zero. When NO3 was \nremoved from the models, the lifetime of CH302 became consid- \nerably longer (>4 hours). This points to the importance of the \nnitrate radical in the processing of RO2 at night in the absence of \nNO (compare with reactions (R2) and (R3)). This route to HO2, \nand hence OH at night, is likely to be of importance in the night- \ntime troposphere, whatever the original source of RO2 (Figure 12). \nMeasurements of OH and HO2 on two nights using the FAGE \ntechnique gave an upper limit for [OH] of 2.5x105 molecules cm -3 \nand an average [HO2]\/[HO2+RO2] ratio of 0.27 (upper limit). \nIn order to assess the relative contributions of ozone and NO3 \nreactions to the peroxy-radical signal observed at night during \nEASE 97, reaction rate calculations were performed in two stages. \nFirst, the total reaction rates were calculated for each mechanism. \nThis showed that the ozone-initiated oxidation routes of HCs out- \nweighed those of NO3 in the NE, SE, and NW sectors. However, \nin the SW sector the two mechanisms operated at similar rates on \naverage, and oxidation by NO3 was the dominant route in the \nwesterly sector. The oxidation of alkenes at night by ozone was \ngreater by a factor of 4 than that by NO3 over the whole data set. \nNext, peroxy-radical formation rates were estimated from both \nmechanisms (Figures 1 and 2). In the NO3 case it was assumed \nthat one RO2 was formed from each NO3 + alkene reaction \n[Wayne et al., 1991]. The NO 3 + CH 4 and NO3 + HCHO reactions \nwere also considered, but not that with DMS, since the main prod- \nuct of this reaction is CH3SCH202, which is not believed to be \ndetectable by the PERCA technique. In the 03 case, literature val- \nues of OH (and inferred RO2) yields were used to estimate total \nRO2 production. The calculations showed that ozone reactions \nproduced more peroxy radicals over the whole night period (de- \nfined as where [NO3] :\/: 0) than nitrate reactions (66 versus 34% on \naverage). However, the two mechanisms were found to operate at \na similar rate in the middle of the night, when [NO3] was highest. \nThe main importance of these results is perhaps that there was a \nsignificant contribution from both mechanisms (Figure 12), since \nprevious tudies have tended to emphasize one as dominant over \nthe other. The HC oxidation rates from the three \"westerly\" sec- \ntors, where tracer mixing ratios were relatively low, may be \nrepresentative of the nighttime oxidative capacity of the marine \nboundary layer throughout the background Northern Hemisphere. \n12,686 SALISBURY ET AL.: PRODUCTION OF PEROXY RADICALS AT NIGHT \nlOO \n= 40 \no \n0 \n[] HO2+NO3 \nB CH3CHOO decay \n\u2022i [] HO2+NO \n\u2022 HO2+O3 \n\u2022 (b) PICH3SO2 \ndecomposition \nm CH3CO3+NO \n[] CH3CHOO decay \n::aOH+CH4 \nlOO \n[30H+O3 \nBOH+HCHO \n[3 O2+CH30 \n'iaOH+CO \nFigure 13.
