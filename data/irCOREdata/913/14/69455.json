Introduction  1 \nIdeas of interdisciplinarity have often found practical expression in research at the 2 \ninterface of environmental science and policy.  Indeed, \u2018joined-up\u2019 thinking is widely 3 \nconsidered a precondition for developing holistic and integrated responses to problems of 4 \nsustainability in society (Holdren, 2008); a process in which the natural and cultural 5 \ndimensions of environmental issues can be marshalled around a common sense of 6 \nintellectual purpose and endeavour. And yet, if it is one thing to assert the idea of 7 \ninterdisciplinary research as central to the ambitions of sustainability science, it is quite 8 \nanother to devise policy interventions that capture and reconcile often divergent 9 \nunderstandings of a given problem. After all, a common aspect of interdisciplinarity is 10 \nthat it pulls together expertise in ways that make approaches to problem solving not only 11 \nmultidimensional in outlook, but coherent in their conception of the world.  This is a 12 \ndaunting task not least because the issues upon which agendas for environmental science 13 \nand policy seek to act are often emergent and novel in form. Interdisciplinary research 14 \nmeans, in part, devising new theoretical constructs in which assessments of 15 \nenvironmental problems can be made. 16 \nOne of the contexts in which this problem is keenly felt, and which forms the focus of 17 \nthis paper, is in the development of holistic approaches to assess environmental risk. 18 \nDeveloping these assessments is arguably key to the political and regulatory culture of 19 \ncontemporary environmental management, but as we shall see, the process of 20 \nconceptualising and operationalising them in an interdisciplinary fashion is fraught with 21 \ntheoretical and methodological challenges. The purpose of this paper is to consider what 22 \nsome of those challenges are by drawing on a recent research project examining the issue 23 \nof microbial pollution of surface waters.  24 \n  2\nIn particular, the paper reflects critically upon efforts to develop an interdisciplinary 1 \nassessment of the factors that may affect the transfer of potential pathogens from 2 \nlivestock farming systems to surface waters.  This is a significant concern of the 3 \ncontemporary environmental protection agenda (Kay et al., 2007). Manures and excreta 4 \nproduced by grazing livestock are an important resource for farmers, but public exposure 5 \nto the pathogenic microorganisms contained within these can lead to gastro-intestinal 6 \nillness, for example infection caused by E. coli O157. Pathways to exposure may occur in 7 \na variety of ways, such as by ingesting contaminated waters through downstream 8 \nrecreational bathing (Graczyk et al., 2007) and through food consumption, for instance by 9 \neating contaminated shellfish (Schets et al., 2007). Alongside these consequences for 10 \nhuman heath, microbial pollution carries with it an economic burden. In the UK it has 11 \nbeen suggested that gastro-intestinal illness caused by E. coli O157 alone is estimated to 12 \ncost over \u00a31 billion per annum in lost productivity and around \u00a330 million annually in 13 \nhealthcare (Jones, 1999). Moreover, the economic \u2018knock-on\u2019 effects of illness among 14 \nhuman populations are potentially very significant for rural areas where agricultural, 15 \nleisure and tourist economies are dependent on wider consumer confidence.  16 \n This papers explore the prospects for developing a holistic assessment of the factors 17 \nthat underlie and create these microbial risks1 as the basis for targeted mitigation at the 18 \nfarm scale.  It begins by introducing the wider policy and regulatory context in which a 19 \nconcern to manage microbial risks is now situated, and goes on to explain how an 20 \ninterdisciplinary approach might begin to capture the cultural2 and natural processes that 21 \ncome to influence them. In particular, the paper describes a procedure in which a 22 \nhypothetical construction of factors driving the transfer of microbial pollutants from land 23 \n                                               \n1\n Microbial risk is understood in this paper as the product of likelihood of microbial contamination and \nmagnitude of microbial impact on watercourses. \n2\n In this paper we use the term \u2018cultural\u2019 as shorthand for the social and economic relations that define \nenvironmental risk, since in much environmental scholarship it is the term \u2018culture\u2019 that is dialectically \nrelated to the word \u2018nature\u2019, and with it, the concerns of natural science. See for example Whatmore (2002).  \n  3\nto surface waters was characterised and then subject to deeper rationalisation and 1 \nrefinement through the technique of expert elicitation. As a result the paper addresses 2 \nsome of the theoretical and methodological issues and conundrums that emerge from 3 \nattempting to conceptualise an operational risk system by bringing quite different 4 \ndisciplinary positions to bear upon its construction, and with this, identifies some of the 5 \nissues arising for environmental researchers when seeking to turn specialist assessments 6 \nof risk into transdisciplinary - \u2018whole system\u2019 - knowledge. At the heart of the paper\u2019s 7 \nargument is the need to come to terms with contrasting assessments of how theoretical 8 \nrepresentations of environmental risk work, and further, the need to address inherent 9 \ndifferences in how cultural and natural processes can be accounted for. As a result of this 10 \nanalysis we move towards a conclusion that highlights the need for building critical 11 \n\u2018unknowns\u2019 into assessments of \u2018known\u2019 risks.  The paper suggests that sustainability 12 \nscience, such as work conducted on the issue of pathogen transfer from livestock farming 13 \npractices, must recognise the partial nature of its assessments. How these uncertainties 14 \nare conveyed in the uptake and application of risk assessment tools and models is, we 15 \nsuggest, just as important as seeking to render complex risks amenable to final prediction 16 \nby way of empirical knowledge. 17 \n 18 \n2. Research Context 19 \nThe insights of this paper were developed under the auspices of a research project 20 \nexamining how farm management practices and circumstances can promote, limit and 21 \nprevent the risk of microbial watercourse contamination 3.  The study employed a Faecal 22 \n                                               \n3\n The research was funded under UK research councils \u2018Rural Economy and Land Use programme\u2019 \n(RELU), project code: RES-224-25-0086 (www.relu.ac.uk). Its focus was on the Taw Catchment in North \nDevon, UK, and has involved: an extensive survey of farmers across the Catchment eliciting attitudes and \npractices towards manure, land and livestock management; detailed microbial monitoring of water courses \non ten of these farms, a review and mitigation methods; and a programme of public participation and \n  4\nIndicator Organism (FIO) approach to researching and understanding pathogenic risks. 1 \nPresent within all human and livestock faeces, FIOs are bacteria indicative of faecal 2 \npollution and therefore potential pathogen presence.  Central to the concerns of this 3 \npaper, the project has also sought to develop a FIO risk assessment tool for farms, one 4 \ndesigned to conceptualise the physical and cultural factors influencing the loss of faecal 5 \nbacteria as the basis for targeted policy inventions.  6 \nThe water policy context to these efforts has been described elsewhere (see Kay et al., 7 \n2008a). Designing risk assessment management plans are increasingly central to the 8 \nregulatory environment within which farm practices now take place. In the UK for 9 \ninstance, state and quasi-state apparatus responsible for issues of environmental 10 \nprotection have introduced a range of mandatory measures and guidance for helping 11 \nfarmers to limit contamination of surface waters at the farm scale. These include the 12 \nDepartment of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs soil and manure management plans 13 \n(Defra, 2003; 2005a) and the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s risk 14 \nassessment for manures and slurries (SEPA, 2004). These frameworks are underpinned 15 \nby more general responsibilities to \u2018codes of good agricultural and environmental 16 \ncondition\u2019 and are central to the conditions under which farmers can participate in new 17 \nenvironmental stewardship programmes, such as Defra\u2019s Entry and Higher level 18 \nstewardship schemes (Defra, 2005b).  The wider agricultural policy context driving these 19 \ndevelopments in the UK and elsewhere has been well rehearsed (Wilson, 2007). 20 \nEuropean farmers have been placed increasingly at the centre of a \u2018public goods\u2019 model 21 \nof the countryside where mandatory responsibilities for environmental protection at the 22 \nfarm and field level exist alongside an increasing \u2018marketisation\u2019 of environmentally 23 \nfriendly products (Buller and Morris, 2004).   24 \n                                                                                                                                            \ndebate in which emerging scientific evidence was explored in relation to wider understandings and \nassessments of environmental risk.   \n  5\nWithin this policy context there is a need to develop sustainable food systems that, by 1 \nway of integrated approaches to land management, can effectively manage the wider, and 2 \noften diffuse, impacts of agriculture on society and economy. Managing for the human 3 \nhealth implications of ingesting pathogenic microorganisms either through recreational 4 \nbathing or the consumption of food is an important driver for fostering assessment 5 \nframeworks to assist both mandatory and voluntary action, not least given the exigencies 6 \nof emerging legislative frameworks such as the EU Water Framework Directive (Kaika, 7 \n2003) and the EU Bathing Water Directive (Georgiou and Bateman, 2005).   Thus, one of 8 \nthe purposes of our research has been to develop a conceptual framework within which 9 \npotential pathogenic risks can begin to be assessed. What this amounts to, in effect, is an 10 \naspiration to construct a \u2018whole system\u2019 conception of microbial risk that can ultimately 11 \ninform the development of a prototypical risk assessment tool for practical use by policy 12 \nmakers, environmental managers and farmers. A characterisation of this tool is reported 13 \non elsewhere (Oliver et al., 2009). The purpose of this inquiry is to examine the issues 14 \nembedded in setting parameters around this tool\u2019s underlying conception of risk and then 15 \neliciting values for it. 16 \n 17 \n3. Characterising an Interdisciplinary Risk System  18 \nAs Chadwick et al. (2008) have argued specifically in the context of microbial 19 \nwatercourse pollution, understandings of environmental risk need to be grounded in a 20 \ndiversity of disciplinary perspectives. We are a research team comprising expertise in 21 \nmicrobiology, hydrochemistry, soil hydrology, manure management, agricultural 22 \ngeography and rural sociology. We have worked on the basis that this expertise forms a 23 \nreasonably diverse \u2018experience-base\u2019 to help identify what the cultural and natural 24 \n  6\nparameters of a FIO risk system4 may, in principle, be. We say \u2018experience base\u2019 rather 1 \nthan simply \u2018evidence base\u2019 because the process of identifying discrete factors or 2 \nvariables that may constitute a set of whole system parameters means combining both 3 \nreliable knowledge into system variables (i.e. factors that we have confidence will have a 4 \nbearing on FIOs as a result of empirical study) but also working assumptions or 5 \n\u2018hunches\u2019, based on anecdotal evidence, about variables that may or may not have been 6 \nstudied in the context of pathogens (i.e. factors that seem to be relevant to FIO behaviour 7 \nbut of which we cannot be sure). In this we have found it useful to draw an analytical 8 \ndistinction between direct and indirect drivers of FIO risk in defining the characteristics 9 \nof our risk system.  10 \nDirect drivers of risk concern variables in our hypothetical system that have an 11 \nimmediate and tangible control over the potential occurrence of FIO transfers from land 12 \nto water. They are factors that operate at a practical and physical scale of expression, and 13 \nimply causal connections that are, in principle, observable and definable within farm 14 \nenvironments. Direct drivers presume, and to some extent may already encompass, an 15 \nemerging evidence base in order to validate their place within a risk system. In general 16 \nterms, the direct drivers we address in this study reflect the empirical work of natural 17 \nscience research, and in our system is reflected in a four-fold categorisation. In particular 18 \nthis categorisation draws inspiration from other environmental risk indexing work most 19 \nnotably the empirically informed 1990 phosphorus index (see Lemunyon and Gilbert 20 \n1993). It encompasses issues of:  21 \n\u0001 Source - incorporating those factors that determine the fundamental presence 22 \nand origin of FIOs within farm environments. These can include: livestock 23 \ngrazing density (Aitken, 2003); faecal inputs and their associated FIO die-off 24 \n                                               \n4\n By \u2018risk system\u2019 we mean a definable and hypothetically bounded set of variables that characterise the \ndrivers of an environmental risk, in this case, the transfer of FIOs from agricultural land to surface waters.   \n  7\nrates (Oliver et al., 2006); manure application methods (Hutchison et al., 2004); 1 \nand grazing duration (White et al., 2001). 2 \n\u0001 Transfer - encompassing those factors encouraging FIOs to start their journey to 3 \na watercourse including, for example: field slopes and shapes (Abu-Ashour and 4 \nLee, 2000; Crowther et al., 2003), soil hydrological properties (Artz et al., 2005) 5 \nand cell interactions with soil particles (Muirhead et al., 2006). 6 \n\u0001 Connectivity - encapsulating those variables that link source and transfer 7 \nmechanisms to a receiving water such as artificial field drainage (Oliver et al., 8 \n2005), overland flow distance (Collins et al., 2005) and direct defecation of 9 \nexcreta into streams (Davies-Colley et al., 2004).  10 \n\u0001 Infrastructure - embodying human material interventions and constructions in 11 \nthe landscape that underpin the presence and movement of FIOs in a given farm 12 \nenvironment (e.g. Edwards et al., 2008). These can include:  manure storage 13 \ncapacity and associated conditions (Smith et al., 2001) but also point source 14 \ninputs of FIOs associated with the hard standings and buildings used by 15 \nlivestock (Kay et al., 2008b).  16 \nIn contrast, indirect drivers of risk have a more tacit influence on FIO risks. They 17 \nencompass those factors that condition FIO risk more widely.  For instance, while it may 18 \nbe possible to infer that the source risk of \u2018grazing density\u2019 tangibly influences the 19 \nmagnitude of FIO risks in a given farm landscape since variations here will govern the 20 \nnumber and rate of organisms excreted onto pasture, the issue of grazing density is, of 21 \ncourse, a land management choice shaped by a wider set of political, economic and 22 \nattitudinal influences. Indirect drivers are therefore designed to enhance the explanatory 23 \npotential of a risk system by acknowledging issues of both \u2018structure\u2019 (for instance, the 24 \ninfluence of policy measures and market incentives) and \u2018agency\u2019 (for example, the effect 25 \n  8\nof values) in processes of farmer decision making. This is a key, and longstanding, 1 \nanalytical distinction within the study of social relations (Giddens, 1984) and central to 2 \nmany theorisations of agricultural change (Wilson, 2007). Indeed, it is in the interplay of 3 \nthese factors that rural studies have sought to make sense of where key determinants of 4 \nfarmer action lie (see for instance, Wilson and Hart, 2000; Burton and Wilson, 2006). Yet 5 \nunlike issues of \u2018source\u2019, \u2018transfer\u2019, \u2018connectivity\u2019 and \u2018infrastructure\u2019, here it is more 6 \nawkward to identify a set of variables that can be packaged into a logical and discrete 7 \nsequence of influences on microbial watercourse pollution, or a set factors that can be 8 \nsystematically linked to material processes at the farm level. Economic and political 9 \ndrivers of FIO risk, for instance, originate in contexts far exceeding the farm gate, such as 10 \npolitical arenas that shape prevailing market and regulatory conditions, while farmer 11 \nattitudes and values are not only difficult to uncover, but tend to be multifaceted and 12 \nunstable (Burton and Wilson, 2006), and therefore defy neat typological prescription 13 \n(Fish et al., 2003). One of the vexed tasks facing the development of an interdisciplinary 14 \nrisk system is therefore to translate a diffuse and nebulous set of issues into a functional 15 \nset of factors; ones amenable to the pragmatic demands of risk assessment. Accepting 16 \nthat these structural and attitudinal influences are part of a spectrum of overlapping 17 \ninfluences, and that, unlike direct drivers, no evidence base exists for understanding 18 \ndeterminants of risk in a specifically FIO context, our research suggests that indirect 19 \ndrivers of risk can be categorised in four key ways: 20 \n\u0001 Income and resources - addressing the material and financial resources that 21 \ninfluence the uptake of measures to limit and prevent FIO risks occurring. Resource 22 \nconstraints (such as access to labour) have been widely recognised to influence 23 \nfarmer\/enterprise decision making (e.g. Lobley and Potter 2004). 24 \n  9\n\u0001 Knowledges and affiliations - encompassing the conditions under which the 1 \nintellectual capital to manage for FIO risks may be communicated, learnt and 2 \nultimately deployed. This element attends to the wider social production and 3 \nexchange of information and knowledge amongst communities of farmers (such as 4 \ntraining and accreditation), a key determinant of enterprise behaviour (Tsouvalis et 5 \nal., 2000)   6 \n\u0001 Non-agricultural activities - reflecting the influence of wider recreational 7 \nassociations with landscape on management attitudes to water quality risks. This 8 \ncomponent situates farm behaviour in the context of multifunctional land use (such 9 \nas recreational pursuits taking place on land); and therefore indexes a key 10 \nexplanatory framework behind motivations to act in contemporary agricultural 11 \nsystems (Wilson, 2007)  12 \n\u0001 Farm structure and trajectory - incorporating variables that link capacities and 13 \ninclinations to manage for risk with prevailing household and enterprise 14 \ncircumstances, (such as type of ownership and stage in lifecycle). This element 15 \ninterprets decision making as a function of more tacit \u2018path-dependencies\u2019 (Wilson 16 \n2008), both economic and cultural in kind. Explicit recognition to the influence of 17 \nbiography and economic transition is given credence in these aspects of the 18 \ncharacterisation. 19 \n A detailed overview of the variables that comprise these direct and indirect 20 \ncategorisations is provided in Tables 1 and 2 respectively, and is accompanied by a 21 \ngeneral rationale for their inclusion in our system. 22 \n 23 \n 24 \n 25 \n  10\n4. Creating an operational system through expert elicitation  1 \nDesigning a hypothetical risk system that draws on the distinction between direct and 2 \nindirect drivers is useful for it allows us to begin thinking systematically about what types 3 \nof evidence would be needed to operationalise the system in practice, and how 4 \ndisciplinary responsibilities might begin to be assigned in such an undertaking. Perhaps 5 \nmost significantly it provides a framework in which the explanatory potential of social 6 \nand natural sciences are understood to be co-dependent.  By definition, the variables 7 \nwhich comprise any given system are open to critical scrutiny, but we suggest that, by 8 \nadopting a multidimensional, experience-based, approach to the task of system building, 9 \na rich and plausible picture of factors driving FIO risk begins to emerge.  10 \nHowever, the process of constructing system parameters is not an end in itself, for it 11 \ntells us nothing about level of significance we might wish to attach to one particular 12 \nvariable over another within the system. As such, if the first task for developing a FIO 13 \nrisk tool is to establish a set of parameters within which microbial risks can be situated, 14 \nthe second is to establish which elements are \u2018more or less\u2019 important to the system. To 15 \ndo this we have followed a body of experimental methodological work that has sought to 16 \ndevelop heuristic assessments of problems through the use of expert elicitation 17 \ntechniques, not least in the context of environmental science (e.g. Geneletti, 2005; 18 \nNguyen and de Kok, 2007; Ye et al,. 2008).  19 \nExpert elicitation is a means by which we can refine understandings of research 20 \nproblems by exposing them to wider critical scrutiny.  Like the issue under consideration 21 \nhere, they are typically deployed in problem contexts where theoretical frameworks are 22 \nnovel and empirical understanding is incomplete.  Some applications of the technique, 23 \nsuch as through the use of the Delphi method or one of its many variants, are 24 \ncharacterised by a desire to reach consensus, building iteration, interaction and feedback 25 \n  11\ninto its approach (Murry & Hammons, 1995; Chu and Hwang, 2008). Consequently, they 1 \nare designed to enable expert judgments to forecast and establish priorities in arenas of 2 \nscience policy that would otherwise remain intractable. That is to say, they allow policy 3 \nprogrammes to be devised on a scientific basis in the absence of conventional forms of 4 \nscientific evidence. The argument here is that elicitation techniques allow policy makers 5 \nto craft judicious responses to emerging problems, not only because the process may 6 \nreveal strong areas of (otherwise unrecognised) agreement but also because they help 7 \ncharacterize and clarify regions of uncertainty (Rizak and Hrudey, 2005). Yet, as von 8 \nKraus et al. (2004 p.1515) note, \u201cin situations where uncertainty is high, different experts 9 \nmay have different interpretations of the data available, and the diversity of opinions may 10 \nbe far larger than that which is suggested by consensus documents, such as risk 11 \nassessment reports\u201d.  Not surprisingly one of the issues facing those who use these 12 \ntechniques is how to inform reasoned responses to policy problems without also 13 \npropagating the idea that scientific debates are somehow settled and resolved. As 14 \nHoffman et al. (2008, p.697) have put it in the context of pathogenic risks:  \u201cExpert 15 \nelicitation ultimately is a complement, not a substitute, for primary research\u2026[ ]\u2026 But it 16 \ncan provide a practical aid to the better management of safety in complex systems where 17 \nperfect information is rarely available but better information might be\u201d. 18 \n4.1 Approach to elicitation 19 \nIn practical terms we initiated a process of expert consultation in which individuals with 20 \ndifferent disciplinary expertise were asked to pass judgment on the relative importance of 21 \npossible controls on FIOs. The elicitation process followed Booker and McNamara 22 \n(2004, p.221) in understanding expert knowledge as that encompassing \u201cwhat qualified 23 \nindividuals know with respect to their technical practices, training and experience\u201d and 24 \nmade a distinction between those working in a natural science setting as having the expert 25 \n  12\nknowledge to gauge the relative importance of the direct bio-physical and management 1 \nvariables, and those working in the context of social-science as able to pass judgment on 2 \nindirect cultural processes and structures.   3 \nLike the distinction between direct and indirect drivers made above, the purpose of 4 \ndisentangling the consultation process into perspectives from the social and natural 5 \nsciences is designed to make an analytical and practical, rather than empirical and 6 \nsubstantive, distinction in how we can conceptualise and understand FIO risk. The 7 \nprocess of selecting participants in the elicitation process was designed to ensure that a 8 \nrange of cognate science and social science areas of research would be represented. For 9 \nthose working in a natural science context we solicited the views of those with expertise 10 \nand standing in academic microbiology, soil and environmental science, as well as 11 \nmembers of the policy community with professional investments and backgrounds in 12 \nmicrobial\/waste management processes. For those working in a social science context we 13 \nsolicited the views of those working in rural geography, agricultural studies, agricultural 14 \neconomics, rural sociology and political science. Whilst those with natural science 15 \nexpertise were required to have experience within the sphere of FIO research in order to 16 \nqualify for inclusion within the consortium (c.f. Cornelissen et al., 2003), this was not the 17 \ncase in the social-science consultation, since as we have made clear above, no substantive 18 \nresearch areas exist to define an expert group in this way. Even so, all of the social 19 \nscientists included in the process were identified on the basis that their background 20 \nintersected with interests in rural environmental change, of which watercourse pollution 21 \nwas a substantive, or at least, related concern.   22 \nAt least one of the implications of this process is that different explanatory logics and 23 \ntypes of analytical and definitional precision have to be created for members of expert 24 \nconsortiums. In the natural science consultation it was recognised, for instance, that 25 \n  13\nexpert responses could be potentially variable depending on whether views were elicited 1 \nfor pathogenic or FIO risks. In a technical sense, FIOs are one strand of a larger 2 \npathogenic issue, a crucial difference to a respondent with precise expertise in this 3 \nresearch area (such as microbiology)5. In the social science context, this definitional 4 \nproblem is inverted. We reasoned that FIOs would mean very little to those with training 5 \nin social science and care was taken to explain \u2018FIOs\u2019 as a framework for examining 6 \npotential pathogenic risks to watercourses.   7 \nThe process was conducted through a standardised electronic scoring schedule, in 8 \nwhich experts were instructed to weight the relative influence of a given risk factor on a 9 \ncontinuous scale ranging from 0 (of no importance) through to 1 (of absolute 10 \nimportance). If respondents felt unable to weight factors with confidence they were 11 \ninstructed to leave potential entries blank. A qualitative dimension was also included in 12 \nthat respondents were allowed to comment and elaborate on their choices should they 13 \nwish to do so. In total 28 experts participated in the elicitation process, representing a 14 \nresponse rate of approximately 80%.  15 \nIt is of note at this juncture to recognise that this methodology is by no means the 16 \nonly way in which the task of eliciting judgment can be approached, and a case has been 17 \nmade for developing more interpretative and discursive approaches to risk and 18 \nuncertainty characterisation (EA, 2008). The approach we adopted in this study was 19 \ndesigned as a first approximation of expert knowledge, and was geared explicitly to the 20 \nproducing responses that could be operationalised easily within a prototypical risk 21 \nassessment tool (Oliver et al., 2009). A deeper contextualisation of expert assessments of 22 \n                                               \n5\n One way of illustrating this point is with regard to our risk factor \u2018animal type\u2019. In an \u2018FIO\u2019 consultation, \nanimal type might not be considered by experts a strong driver of risk, relative to other factors, because all \nlivestock faeces contain considerable FIO content. But this is not necessarily the case should we have \ndevised the consultation around \u2018pathogens\u2019 per se. Here animal type may be considered more important \n(for instance lambs are also large cryptosporidium reservoirs).  The definitional formula is not merely a \ntechnicality: it could significantly influence measures arising from risk assessment.     \n \n  14\nrisk through, for instance, depth and interviews would be a logical development on the 1 \ninsight developments here (see for instance, Philips, 1999) 2 \n 4.2 Gauging the relative importance of system variables 3 \nA general summary of statistics associated with the expert weighting exercise is shown in 4 \nTables 3 and 4. As an initial layer of analysis, the project team calculated the arithmetic 5 \nmean of expert weightings for each variable as a way of assessing their relative 6 \nimportance to the system as a whole. Assessing relative significance in this rudimentary 7 \nway begins the process of understanding where priorities for FIO risk assessment might 8 \nlie. Thus, following this approach the expert elicitation process suggests that \u2018livestock 9 \naccess to streams\u2019 would be considered a key driver of risk on the basis of the natural 10 \nscience consultation, for it achieved a mean expert weighting of 0.82 among experts, the 11 \nhighest across all risk categories, and accommodates a strong negative skew in the 12 \ndistribution of weightings received. Other salient factors included the transfer risk of 13 \n\u2018runoff potential\u2019 (0.73), the infrastructural risk of \u2018drainage\u2019 (0.72), and the source risks 14 \nof \u2018stocking density\u2019 and (0.72) \u2018manure type\u2019 (0.66).  In the social science consultation, 15 \nkey determinants of risk included whether a farmer had access to \u2018technical grants for 16 \nwaste management\u2019 (0.83), the extent to which farming activities were currently 17 \nstructured through \u2018participation in agri-environmental schemes\u2019 (0.69), and whether 18 \npractices were embedded in \u2018organic farming\u2019 regimes (0.68). With a mean weighting of 19 \n0.58 the \u2018size of the holding\u2019 also constituted a higher ranking determinant of risk in the 20 \nsocial science assessment.  21 \nBy implication the consultation process also pointed to areas of our risk system where 22 \nthe impact of variables was considered relatively weak.  So, for instance, while the results 23 \nof the natural science consultation suggest that importance should be attached to 24 \n\u2018livestock access to streams\u2019, another source risk \u2018livestock type\u2019 achieved a mean 25 \n  15\nweighting of only 0.35, the lowest across all natural science risk categories. Likewise, the 1 \nimportance experts attached to the transfer risk of \u2018run-off potential\u2019 can be contrasted 2 \nwith issues of \u2018erosion\u2019 and \u2018preferential flow\u2019 potential, which returned mean weightings 3 \nof 0.38 and 0.56, respectively. In the social science consultation, the significance experts 4 \nassigned to \u2018size of holding\u2019 can be neatly contrasted with \u2018tenure of holdings\u2019, which 5 \nreturned a mean expert weighting of only 0.30. Moreover, the social science consultation 6 \nplaced little importance on lifecycle issues such as \u2018succession\u2019 and recreational factors 7 \nsuch as the \u2018presence of public rights of ways on or bordering land\u2019. Both these factors 8 \nachieved mean weightings of only 0.26. Of course, the range of expert weightings 9 \nreceived for each risk factor may be used in the future for uncertainty assessment 10 \n(Refsgaard et al., 2007) and fuzzy modelling approaches but that is beyond the scope of 11 \nthis present paper.  12 \n 13 \n4.3 Areas of expert consensus and disagreement  14 \nOn the basis of this analysis our system begins to take shape as a framework in which 15 \ndistinctions about FIO risk can begin to be drawn. However, making judgments in this 16 \nway tells us nothing about the extent to which experts agreed or disagreed about the 17 \nrelative importance of risk factors. Risk factors may be ranked high or low, but variables 18 \ncan have differing levels of consensus attached to them.  This is an important underlying 19 \nissue, for as we have shown, in discriminating between the relative influence of given 20 \nfactors, a risk assessment framework would also ideally aspire to focus on system 21 \nvariables that have a high degree of consensus attached to them across disciplinary 22 \nboundaries.  23 \nThe dimensions of this latter issue are expressed as box and whisker plots in 24 \nFigures 1 and 2. For the natural science consultation there were a number of high and low 25 \n  16\nranking variables where experts displayed a high degree of consensus (i.e. a narrow 1 \ninterquartile range). So, for instance, the highly ranking source factor of \u2018stocking 2 \ndensity\u2019 was accompanied by the lowest interquartile range and standard deviation 3 \n(\u03c3) among experts (see Table 3), suggesting that collective confidence in the influence of 4 \nthis variable was strong. Equally, there was close agreement among experts regarding 5 \nsome factors which were otherwise considered to be weak in their influence. The 6 \nconnectivity risk factor of \u2018gateway location\u2019, which returned a mean expert weighting of 7 \n0.39, would be a case in point here (\u03c3 =0.21). In the social science consultation there 8 \nwere also generally strong levels of agreement surrounding high ranking factors such as 9 \n\u2018technical grants\u2019 (\u03c3 =0.19), but perhaps most notably, surrounding the influence of 10 \nresponsibilities under \u2018cross-compliance\u20196 (\u03c3 =0.17), a factor attaining a moderate expert 11 \nmean weighting of 0.49.  12 \nYet these findings have to be squared with variables where expert opinion was largely 13 \ndivided. In the natural science consultation there was considerable variability over the 14 \nimportance we should assign to infrastructural factors. For example, while the mean 15 \nweighting for \u2018farm tracks\u2019 was ranked moderately at 0.40, some experts suggested its 16 \nweighting should be as high as 0.80, while others considered it of no importance at all in 17 \ndriving risk, resulting in a standard deviation of 0.25 for this risk factor. How do we 18 \nexplain such discrepancies? At one level it may be argued that contrasting visions reflect 19 \nan uncertain evidence base. For example, Edwards et al. (2008) note that a general 20 \nawareness exist regarding farmyards as sources and contributors of pollutants to 21 \nreceiving waters but stress that few measurements have actually been made to quantify 22 \ncontaminant flux from these areas. However, even where empirical research exists, wide 23 \ninterquartile ranges can be returned. An interesting example of this was with regard to the 24 \n                                               \n6\n In the UK cross-compliance embodies a set of mandatory conditions regarding good agricultural conduct \nand underpins state support for agriculture in the form of a \u2018single farm payment\u2019.  \n  17\nsource risk factor of \u2018aged faecal material\u2019. Consensus here was weak (\u03c3 =0.28)  despite 1 \nempirical research from the 1980s reporting on patterns of release of FIOs from ageing 2 \nfaeces (Thelin and Gifford, 1983; Kress and Gifford, 1984).  3 \nSuch discrepancies may well demonstrate the need to further consolidate 4 \nunderstanding of some drivers of microbial watercourse contamination not only through 5 \nfuture research agendas (Kay et al., 2007; Kay et al., 2008a) but in their effective 6 \ndissemination across different knowledge domains, but we suggest there may be a deeper 7 \nproblematic at stake. At a more theoretical level this divergence may reflect tensions that 8 \ninherently exist between making \u2018whole system\u2019 assessments of risk and the disciplinary 9 \nnature of expertise partly informing the principle of expert judgements. In our risk 10 \nassessment, respondents were asked to comment on the relative importance of controls 11 \nacross the risk system, but the basis of participation in the exercise was dictated, in part, 12 \nby their status as authority figures with \u2018specialist\u2019 types of expertise: that is, by their 13 \nknowledge of particular components of the risk system.  And as the literature on expert 14 \nelicitation argues in this vein, when individuals respond as experts in this way they tend 15 \nto be overconfident in recognizing the influence of those factors that reflect their 16 \nprofessional remits and worldviews. Or as Granger Morgan et al. (2001, p.282) put it 17 \n\u201cgiven their knowledge, \u2026[the]\u2026 subjective probability distributions \u2026[of experts] \u2026 18 \ntend to be too narrow\u201d. In other words, precise notions of expertise tend to shape the 19 \nemphasis placed on particular aspects of risk assessment, leading to divergent accounts of 20 \nhow a system works.    21 \nA telling example of this is in relation to two elements of the natural science 22 \nassessment: \u2018preferential flow potential\u2019 and \u2018animal type\u2019.  Whereas respondents with a 23 \nbackground in microbiology weighted the former issue of lowest importance in the risk 24 \nsystem, those with soil science interest ranked this highest.  Conversely, whereas a 25 \n  18\nnumber of microbiologists ranked \u2018animal type\u2019 as an issue of key importance, many 1 \nexperts in soil science assigned it low significance. How far should we be surprised by 2 \nthese divergent opinions? After all, preferential flow potential is a core concept of soil 3 \nscience and will therefore be central to the professional remit those working in this area 4 \nof specialism. But this concern is outside of the formal scope of microbiology, where 5 \nanimal-led explanations of risk are likely to prevail. The data provide further examples of 6 \nthis issue. Responses to the risk assessment reveal that those natural science respondents 7 \nworking directly in the arena of FIO policy intervention and development consistently 8 \nprovide higher risk ratings to the importance of individual elements in the risk system 9 \nthan academic scientists, perhaps reflecting how professional investments and awareness 10 \nin the given risk issue can tend to magnify overall understandings of risk. For example, 11 \ngrouping the natural science expert panel into non-academic policy experts, 12 \nmicrobiologists, soil scientists and environmental scientists revealed that the policy-based 13 \nexperts ranked 17 of the 22 risk factors with higher mean weightings, and on one of these 14 \noccasions (for the risk factor \u2018farmyard drainage to watercourse\u2019) the difference between 15 \nexpert groups, derived using an analysis of variance test, was significant (P<0.05). The 16 \npolicy expert group weighted this risk factor as 0.98 (clearly illustrating near universal 17 \nagreement of the absolute importance of this risk factor), whereas the microbiologists, 18 \nsoil scientists and environmental scientists groupings returned average weightings of 19 \n0.64, 0.60 and 0.65, respectively.  20 \nIn other words this initial analysis of results suggests that disciplinary and 21 \nprofessional investments produce interesting distinctions in how FIO risks come to be 22 \nconceptualised, though in making this claim we feel it necessary to exercise some caution 23 \nhere. Drawing conclusions in this way presumes that affiliations and expertise exist as a 24 \nseries of tightly bounded, and mutually-exclusive, entities, when in practice, this may not 25 \n  19\nbe the case. Disciplinary boundaries and identities are often quite fuzzy both in terms of 1 \nprofessional practices and research preoccupations; while the world of academic research 2 \nand policy driven science are often fundamentally entwined in terms of career pathways 3 \nand research priorities.  Nonetheless, we suggest that these findings point to one way in 4 \nwhich divergent assessments of FIO risk might begin to be interpreted from an 5 \ninterdisciplinary perspective. 6 \nNotwithstanding the need to understand why these divergent responses arise, one of 7 \nthe key issues that such heterogeneity poses is how to arrive at overall assessments of risk 8 \nthat would allow a future risk tool to be operationalised in practice. The use of mean 9 \nexpert responses was our response to this approach, though it does not resolve the 10 \nunderlying ontological problem here: how to create a common, as in collectively agreed 11 \nupon, vision of the risk system? 12 \n4.4 The indeterminacy of risk  13 \nTo the theoretical conundrum of establishing a common vision we wish to add a further 14 \nand final dimension.  This concerns the issue of indeterminacy. One of the tacit 15 \nassumptions underlying our analysis is that a given control on FIO risk has a consistent 16 \nrelationship with how a risk is influenced. That is to say, experts may or may not agree 17 \nthat one variable is more important than another in the system, but the assumption is that 18 \nthe direction of risk is clear. In many cases this assumption is fair. Certainly it is true of 19 \nour direct risk factors.  So for example it is clearly logical to suggest that the steeper a hill 20 \nslope the greater the potential for run-off, and therefore risk of FIO loss from land, just as 21 \nwe can claim, with confidence, that the export of FIOs from land to water would be less 22 \nlikely under extensive grazing regimes. However, in the case of our indirect drivers, this 23 \nprinciple does not necessarily follow.  While it may be reasonable to infer that 24 \n\u2018participation in an agri-environmental scheme\u2019 or \u2018receipt of technical grants\u2019 would be 25 \n  20\nlinked with a potential reduction in FIO risk, it seems much more problematic to make 1 \nsuch connections with a number of other indirect variables. So, for example, the variable 2 \n\u2018length of time in farming\u2019 is interesting in a social science context for it implies 3 \ncapacities and inclinations that may influence risk in a variety of ways. Recent entrants to 4 \nfarming may bring with them new models of working that are conducive to working 5 \nwithin the mandates of modern environmental protection, but so too may they lack the 6 \nvery skill-sets that would come from longstanding involvement in a particular system of 7 \nlivestock farming.   In other words, the system variable \u2018length of time in farming\u2019 8 \nembodies in it a range of influences conducive to different types of outcome.  This 9 \nindeterminacy seems to be true of \u2018farm succession\u2019, \u2018size\u2019 and \u2018tenure\u2019 of land farmed 10 \nand influence of \u2018debt\u2019. Contrasting narratives of FIO risk could be assigned to these 11 \nendemic characteristics and circumstance of a farm system.  12 \nAnticipating this response in the expert consultation, we examined this issue directly 13 \nwith social scientists.  Alongside the process of assigning importance to system elements, 14 \nwe asked these experts to make judgments about how the direction of risk might unfold. 15 \nTo do this, experts were presented with a series of propositions about the potential 16 \ninfluence of all indirect variables on FIO risk. Thus in the case of farm size, experts were 17 \nasked to consider the proposition \u2018The transfer of FIOs to water courses is less likely the 18 \nsmaller the area farmed\u2019.  Experts could then offer different responses to these 19 \npropositions to indicate the extent to which they agreed with the proposition or could 20 \noffer a meaningful response to it. A summary of these propositions and the framework 21 \nfor expert responses is depicted in Table 5. The box and whisker plots, revealing extents 22 \nof agreement between respondents to this aspect of the consultation, are displayed in 23 \nFigure 4.  24 \n  21\nNot surprisingly the consultation identified some areas of social science agreement 1 \nwhere the directional influence of variables is clear. Collectively, the response of the 2 \nconsultation suggests that \u2018receipt of technical grants\u2019 would be likely to lower FIO risks, 3 \nas would \u2018responsibilities under cross compliance\u2019, \u2018participation in agri-environmental 4 \nschemes\u2019 and \u2018organic farming\u2019, as well as \u2018formal accreditation in land and livestock 5 \nmanagement\u2019. Yet as anticipated, in other instances, the consultation raised profound 6 \ndisagreements over the directional influence of variables. Issues of \u2018tenure\u2019, \u2018succession\u2019 7 \nand most notably \u2018farm size\u2019 stand out here. While size of holding is a relatively high 8 \nranking factor, there was little agreement about the direction of risk we might attach to a 9 \nparticular operational farm scale. Many refused to draw neat conclusions. One suggested 10 \nthat \u201cthose with a limited area may have more of a waste disposal problem\u201d, but pointed 11 \nto alternative circumstances where size might imply farmers were \u201cless intensive 12 \nsmallholders\u201d with lower risks.  13 \nThe consultation suggests therefore, that there is no consistent way of assigning risks 14 \nto particular variants of some risk conditioning issues.  We suggested in the section above 15 \nthat a fundamental problem for those wishing to create holistic conceptions of risk is how 16 \nto \u2018overcome\u2019 differences in expert knowledge regarding how the system \u2018works\u2019. Here 17 \nthe issue seems to be rather different. Such indeterminacies are problems produced by the 18 \ngeneric needs of risk assessment, not differences in expert opinion per se.  It is tempting, 19 \nfor instance, to ignore issues such as \u2018size\u2019, \u2018tenure\u2019 and \u2018succession\u2019 because they cannot 20 \nbe standardized across a range of circumstances. But the message of this aspect of our 21 \nconsultation is that risk assessment frameworks should not only be generic in design but 22 \nsensitive to context.  In other words, size may well be an important generic variable, but 23 \nwe can only draw conclusions about its determinate influence when studying precise sets 24 \nof circumstances. 25 \n  22\n4.5 Quantifying potential errors associated with expert weightings 1 \nThe expert consultation exercise outlined in this study was designed to elicit indicative 2 \nresponses from experts in relevant disciplines that could help make an on-farm risk tool 3 \noperational. Associated weightings derived through this process were eventually 4 \nembedded into a cross-disciplinary toolkit to assess the risk of faecal indicator loss from 5 \ngrassland farm systems to surface waters (Oliver et al., 2009). While the statistical 6 \nanalysis of the data presented in this study centres on traditional differences in 7 \ndistributions of expert weightings for given risk factors there is a realisation that there is 8 \nlikely to be a degree of interdependency between weighted risk factors when incorporated 9 \ninto integrated risk management tools. It is when expert derived data is incorporated into 10 \ndecision support tools (DST) that we can begin to undertake a more in-depth analysis of 11 \nvariations in expert judgement. Whilst beyond the remit of this current study, it would be 12 \nwise to undertake a full sensitivity analysis of any DST that accommodates expert 13 \njudgement to determine the responsiveness of DST output to changes in individual risk 14 \nfactor weightings. For example, if DSTs inform end-users of an index of relative risk of a 15 \nparcel of land contributing a pollutant to a watercourse then what would be the effect on 16 \nthe final risk index of a change in any single risk factor weighting of, for example, 0.01 17 \nor 0.1? Furthermore, which risk factors are most sensitive to these changes? 18 \nReporting on the range of original expert weightings embedded within management 19 \ntools enables researchers to assess the error placed on calculated risk indices when the 20 \nstandard deviations (or confidence intervals) of the mean for each risk factor weighting 21 \nare taken into account. Given that different expert weightings (such as those derived in 22 \nthis study) carry different ranges of opinion we can begin to assess which risk factors 23 \ncontribute most to the errors intrinsic to expert weighted risk indexing approaches, thus 24 \nallowing a decision to be made as to whether a risk factor might be justifiably omitted. 25 \n  23\nPerhaps more importantly, the ranges of difference in expert weightings can highlight 1 \nrisk factors to target for fundamental research to better align expert opinion.  2 \n 3 \n5. Concluding remarks  4 \nIn a paper speculating on future developments in the field of microbiology Curtis (2007) 5 \nargued recently for the creation of numerically reliable, and widely applicable, 6 \nexplanatory frameworks for microbiological research; ones linked expressly to the needs 7 \nof wider political and social agendas and involving the development of a \u201cconsilient and 8 \ncalibrated set of rules to describe and predict the behaviour of the microbial world as a 9 \nsystem\u201d (Ibid p.1). In this paper we have sought to examine some of the complexities that 10 \narise from seeking to foster such systemic and applied understandings of the microbial 11 \nworld. If we were to appropriate Curtis\u2019 vision for our particular purposes and take it to 12 \nits logical conclusion, then this would be a process in which researchers would be able to 13 \ncalibrate real world livestock systems according to the intrinsic orderliness of potential 14 \npathogen transfer within agricultural environments. In so doing, it may be possible to 15 \nstart to make highly reliable judgments about the conditions under which microbial risks 16 \nare present and thereby controlled.  17 \nThe paper has described an experimental process in which such a system might begin 18 \nto be imagined. Like many arenas of environmental sustainability there are few empirical 19 \nreference points in which to begin navigating a stable pathway through the essentially 20 \ncomplex and unbounded system of FIO risk.  In this our research suggests that an 21 \ninterdisciplinary approach can greatly enhance the plausibility of a hypothetical system 22 \nand can underpin the development of a new generation of study areas that are linking 23 \nostensibly disparate research areas together. The idea of \u2018diffusion pollution studies\u2019 24 \n(Lane et al. 2006), of which an account of FIO risk would ultimately be a part, is a case in 25 \n  24\npoint. Yet, so too has our research served to underline the substantive difficulties, both 1 \ntheoretical and methodological, in arriving at a shared picture of the world.  The idea of 2 \nbuilding rule-governed, \u2018whole system\u2019, conceptions of environmental processes is itself 3 \na distinct, and by no means unproblematic, theoretical aspiration. Assuming that we can 4 \nfoster interdisciplinary teams to collaborate in this endeavour, the means by which we 5 \nthen arrive at internally stable conceptions of risk is by no means accepted or understood. 6 \nAs we have shown, one of the paradoxes of building interdisciplinary pictures is that 7 \nthey necessarily emerge out of precise areas of scholarship, and this will mean that 8 \nconceptual and analytical differences over how a system works will tend to be magnified 9 \nas much as they will be diminished. One of the challenges facing those creating holistic 10 \napproaches to environmental risk assessment is therefore how to develop methodologies 11 \nby which such discrepancies can be overcome. In other senses, taking a whole system 12 \napproach begins to reveal complexities that question the way we structure our 13 \nrepresentations of problems, and with this, the nature of our interventions. It may well be 14 \nthat some drivers of risk are indeterminate, which fundamentally alters the needs of risk 15 \nassessment.  16 \nWith these problems and challenges, we suggest, comes responsibility to design 17 \nprocedures that can acknowledge, rather than bury, endemic system uncertainties.  This 18 \nseems axiomatic given that theoretical representations of environmental problems reside 19 \nas much in a world of policy \u2018readiness\u2019 as they do in the long term agendas of scientific 20 \nresearch. Faced with the need to construct reasoned responses to emerging policy 21 \nquestions, such as the management and mitigation of FIOs, we need to be circumspect 22 \nwhen translating highly tentative and contested constructions of environmental problems 23 \ninto expert systems with \u2018ready-made\u2019 answers.  24 \n 25 \n  25\nAcknowledgements 1 \nThe authors would like to acknowledge the participation of the 28 anonymous experts for 2 \ntheir valuable contributions in the risk factor weighting exercise.
