However, the uptake of such\nsystems in Europe has been limited by a combination of unsupportive policies and\nuncertainty concerning their productivity, profitability, and environmental impact. Faced\nwith a lack of experimental data, the parameter-sparse Yield-SAFE model offers one\nmethod for generating plausible yield data and improving understanding of production in\nmixed tree-crop systems under European conditions. The applicability of the model was\nexamined by: i) selecting two contrasting sites in France and the UK with measured\nagricultural, silvoarable and\/or forestry data, ii) implementing the model in a software\npackage, and iii) inputting data and parameters on the climate, soils, management regime,\nand tree and crop types. Following calibration, Yield-SAFE provided credible descriptions\nof measured arable and tree (Populus spp) yields in the monoculture and silvoarable systems\nat the two sites. An examination of the response of the model to changes in model\nparameters and environmental and management data showed that that silvoarable crop\nyields were most sensitive to variations in tree parameters. Increased soil depths increased\ntimber yields, and increasing stand density increased stand volume whilst decreasing\nindividual tree volume. In all the simulations, the model predicted greater efficiency in use\nof land, i.e. greater land equivalent ratios, when trees and crops were combined rather than\ngrown as sole crops. These results, supported by the sparse experimental data available,\nindicate that agroforestry provides a method of increasing food, timber and biomass\nproduction from limited land resources in Europe.\n3INTRODUCTION\nThe European Commission\u2019s Rural Development Regulation for 2007-2013 (Commission of\nthe European Union, 2005) has introduced measures to promote agroforestry because of its\n\u201chigh ecological and social value\u201d and because of the potential of producing high-quality\nforestry products. This is an exciting development as agroforestry systems have often been\nneglected because of the administrative separation of forestry and agriculture departments\n(McAdam et al. 2009). One form of agroforestry practice is silvoarable agroforestry where\narable crops are grown between widely-spaced trees (Burgess et al., 2004). Such arable\ncultivation is practiced at some time on about 10-16% of the 3 million ha of the dehesas of\nSpain and the montados of Portugal (Eichhorn et al., 2006). An important role of the\ncultivation is to control the invasion of shrubs which are not grazed by livestock. Silvoarable\nagroforestry integrating poplar trees with cereal crops is practiced in the Po Valley region of\nItaly, and such systems have been used in the UK (Eichhorn et al., 2006). In France, about\n2000 ha of silvoarable systems were planted in the winter of 2007-2008 and a further half a\nmillion hectares could potentially be planted. For Europe as a whole, it has been estimated\nthat approximately 56% of arable land could support silvoarable systems with about 40%\nbenefitting from improvement of an existing environmental problem (Reisner et al., 2006).\nHowever, there is limited knowledge on the productivity of these mixed tree-crop systems,\nin comparison to tree or crop monocultures, under European conditions.\nModelling can help to generate insight into the productivity of agroforestry systems, based\non robust principles governing resource acquisition and use efficiency in crop and tree\nsystems (van Ittersum & Rabbinge, 1997). To apply those principles to agroforestry\nsystems, the Yield-SAFE model (van der Werf et al., 2007) was conceptualized to provide a\nparameter sparse but ecophysiologically-based simulation model for tree and crop growth in\n4agroforestry systems. The model, which operates on a daily time-step, simulates growth and\ndry matter accumulation of trees and crops over the whole growing cycle of a tree stand.\nFor each day, the model calculates light interception by the trees and the crop, and derives\nthe potential dry matter production. The actual, water-limited, dry matter production is then\nderived by taking into account water availability for the tree and the crop, and a simple\nwater balance model. Growth and senescence of leaf cover of trees and crop is calculated at\ndaily basis, based on simulation of phenological processes, driven by temperature, and the\nassimilates available for growing leaves. The Yield-SAFE was designed to be \u201cas simple as\npossible\u201d. Thus, the model consists of only seven differential equations, for (1) crop leaf\narea, (2) tree leaf area, (3) crop biomass, (4) tree biomass, (5) number of tree branches; (6)\nsoil water, and (7) temperature sum. Despite the parsimonious modelling philosophy, the\nYield-SAFE model still has 22 ecophysiological parameters characterizing the plant-\nenvironment interactions, and further parameters and forcing functions representing\nmanagement. The only environmental inputs are daily mean temperature, daily incoming\nradiation, and daily precipitation. A concise description of the equations and parameters is\ngiven in van der Werf et al. (2007). This paper advances that work by aiming to demonstrate\nthe applicability of the Yield-SAFE model to: i) simulate existing systems at two contrasting\nsites and to ii) predict the responses of trees and crops in novel arable, forestry and\nagroforestry systems.\nGiven the parameter requirements of Yield-SAFE, and the scarcity of agroforestry\nexperiments in Europe, parameterisation is a non-trivial task. Here, we provide an example\nof how the model the Yield-SAFE model was parameterised in an iterative process, using\ncrop, tree, soils and climate data from two contrasting sites in Europe. One site is based in a\nrelatively cool Atlantic climate, and the other site in a Mediterranean climate where\n5radiation, temperature and drought stress levels are greater. After model parameterisation,\nand evaluation of the main model results, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine\nthe main factors affecting the productivity of agroforestry, compared to monocultures of\ntrees and crops.\nMETHOD\nThe broad method of demonstrating the applicability of the Yield-SAFE model can be\ndescribed as a five-stage process (Fig. 1). The first three stages were i) identifying and\ndescribing two field sites with measured data, ii) implementing the Yield-SAFE model code\ndescribed by van der Werf et al. (2007), and iii) selecting model inputs for the climate, soil,\ncrop, tree and management regime (Fig. 1) and a first estimation of model eco-physiological\nparameters based on bibliography and expert knowledge. The fourth stage comprised a\nperiod of iteration where up to three parameters were modified until the outputs of the\nmodel matched the measured outputs. These stages are described within this method\nsection. Using parameter values that resulted in modelled yields similar to the measured\nyields, the model was then used to predict the tree and crop yields for different tree densities\nand soil depths. This process is described in the results section.\nIdentification of field sites\nThe first stage was to identify two European sites where there was a series of silvoarable\ntree and crop yield data. The two sites were V\u00e9z\u00e9nobres in the Languedoc-Roussillon\nregion of southern France, and Silsoe in the county of Bedfordshire in Eastern England\n(Table 1). Both are located on land that is typically used in arable production in their\nrespective areas. Although the sites were chosen because of the availability of field\nmeasurements, there were still gaps in the data. At the V\u00e9z\u00e9nobres and Silsoe sites, data\nwere available for the early stage of a tree rotation, but the trees had not been harvested.\n6Because of this, some of the tree and crop data had to be derived from a synthesis of field\nmeasurements, statistical data, and expert opinion.\nV\u00e9z\u00e9nobres\nThe V\u00e9z\u00e9nobres site in Southern France is located in a region where half the land is used for\nagriculture and half for forestry; typical agricultural crops are vines, forage crops and\ncereals. In 1996, a 1.57 ha silvoarable and forestry experiment was planted using 5 m un-\nrooted sets of poplar (Populus spp) clones I-214 and I-4551. The trial included a forestry (7\nm x 7 m spacing; 204 trees ha-1) and a silvoarable (139 trees ha-1) area. The tree rows in the\nsilvoarable area were oriented in a north-south direction with a spacing of 4.5 m x 16 m\n(including a 1-m wide tree strip). The owner of the site had leased the intercrop area of the\nsilvoarable system to a farmer, who also managed the arable control. There was an\nagreement that the owner should prune the trees so that overhanging branches would not\nimpede the movement of agricultural machinery in the intercrop area. Otherwise the\nmanagement of the forestry and arable plots was typical for forestry and arable systems in\nthe area. The trees at the site potentially have access to a high water table.\nIn V\u00e9z\u00e9nobres, the height and diameter of poplar clone I-214 were recorded annually from\nplanting in 1996 to 2005. The trees in silvoarable plots were initially smaller than those in\nforestry plots, but nine years after planting they were of similar size. Expert opinion was\nused to derive estimates of the timber volumes of the silvoarable (0.98 m3 tree-1) and forestry\n(0.88 m3 tree-1) trees at a harvestable age of 15 years (Fig. 2a). The crops grown in the\nsilvoarable system were predominantly durum wheat (Triticum durum Desf.), but also\nincluded one year of asparagus and sorghum and two years of fallow. Hence a combination\nof assumed and measured yields were used to derive a yield profile of the arable crops that\ndecreased from a relative value of 90% in year 1 to 30% in year 12 (Fig. 2c), after which it\n7was assumed that no intercrop would be grown. A typical yield for durum wheat in the area\n(4.0 t ha-1) was used as a reference yield for the arable plot.\nSilsoe\nThe Silsoe site in Eastern England is located in an area dominated by cereal, oilseed rape\nand protein field crops (64% of the agricultural area); woodlands occupy only about 7% of\nthe area. The experimental silvoarable site was managed as part of the UK silvoarable\nnetwork and is fully described by Burgess et al. (2004). The silvoarable and \u201cforestry\u201d\ncomponents covered 2.5 ha and comprised three replicate blocks that included each\ncombination of four poplar hybrids (Beaupr\u00e9, Trichobel, Gibecq, and Robusta) and one\nforestry and two silvoarable treatments. Between March and April 1992, in both the forestry\nand silvoarable treatments, poplar was planted at a spacing of 10 m x 6.4 m (156 trees ha-1)\nwith rows oriented north-south. Planting stock consisted of 1.5 - 2.0 m un-rooted sets which\nwere inserted to a depth of 0.6 m in the soil. The \u201cintercrop\u201d area within the \u201cforestry\u201d\ntreatment was kept fallow by regular cultivation, whilst the silvoarable area was cropped on\nan annual basis. Following poor crop yields in the initial three years, a wheat (Triticum\naestivum L.) crop was harvested in 1995, 1996 and 1997, followed by field beans (Vicia\nfaba L.), two more wheat crops, a bare-fallow, barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), and field\nbeans. Arable control plots, located at least 15 m from the nearest poplar, were managed in\nthe same way as the silvoarable intercrop. Yield data reported in Burgess et al. (2004) show\nthat the interference by the trees on crop growth in the arable control plots has been\nminimal.\nTree and crop measurements taken at Silsoe showed that twelve years after planting, timber\nvolume was 0.35 m3 tree-1 in the forestry plots and 0.25 m3 tree-1 in the silvoarable plots\n(Fig. 2b) (Burgess et al., 2003; 2004). The dimensions and volumes of poplar trees in the\n8forestry treatments were between those for empirical growth models of poplar for Yield\nClasses 12 and 14 (Christie, 1994). Mean timber volumes for Yield Classes 12 and 14 were\ntherefore used to predict growth beyond the period provided by field measurements to final\nharvest. This provided a reference timber volume of 2.41 m3 tree-1 in the forestry plot in\nyear 30. In the case of the silvoarable treatment, the current yield was similar to the growth\nshown for Yield Class 10. This then provided a timber volume of 1.85 m3 tree-1 in the\nsilvoarable plot in year 30. Because the timeliness of some crop management operations\nwas sub-optimal, resulting in late planting or planting into wet seedbeds, arable crop yields\nwere often below commercial levels. Therefore the yield for the intercrop was expressed as\na proportion of crop yield in the arable plot. This showed a yield decline from about 80%\nfrom years 1 to 4 to 70% between years 4 and 8, and 60% between years 9 and 12 (Fig. 2d).\nThe reference yields for control arable crops of wheat (8.23 t ha-1), barley (6.83 t ha-1) and\noilseed (3.44 t ha-1) were derived from statistical data for yields on Bedfordshire clay and\nare typical of the area (Lang, 2004).\nImplementing Yield-SAFE model code\nThe Yield-SAFE equations developed to predict crop and tree yields in arable, forestry and\nsilvoarable systems, described by van der Werf et al. (2007), were implemented in a\nMicrosoft Excel\u00a9 spreadsheet platform called Plot-SAFE by Burgess et al. (2004a). The\ncore equations were implemented in a single worksheet called \u201cYield-SAFE\u201d, which uses\ndefault values for the meteorological, soil, tree, and crop parameters from a second\nworksheet called \u201cBio-parameters\u201d. A third worksheet called \u201cCrop-manager\u201d describes the\noverall system including the crop rotation and tree management. A description of Plot-\nSAFE and a user guide for this version are available from Cranfield University (Graves and\nBurgess, 2007).\n9Selection of model inputs and parameters\nThe third stage of the process was to input data relating to i) meteorology, ii) soil, iii) site\nmanagement, iv) the tree species, and v) the crop. These are described in turn.\nMeteorological data\nThe required meteorological inputs to the model were daily solar radiation, temperature, and\nrainfall. Data for V\u00e9z\u00e9nobres consisted of a 12-year dataset from a local site, from January\n1996 to December 2008; the first year and the last two years of this data were repeated to\nprovide a 15 year dataset. For Silsoe, 30 years of data were developed using a weather\ngenerator, CLIGEN 5.2 (United States Department of Agriculture, 2005). The reference\nvalues (Global Data Systems, 2005) for Silsoe were generated from a weather station in\nCranfield, approximately 15 km north-west.\nThe mean annual solar radiation and mean air temperature at V\u00e9z\u00e9nobres (5121 MJ m-2;\n14.4\u00b0C) were greater than at Silsoe (4356 MJ m-2; 9.1\u00b0C). The mean annual rainfall at\nV\u00e9z\u00e9nobres (1000 mm) was also greater than at Silsoe (611 mm). However the seasonal\ndistribution of the rainfall at V\u00e9z\u00e9nobres was more uneven, with rainfall primarily occurring\nduring the winter months. The data for both sites are summarised in Table 1.\nSoil data\nThe soils were classified in terms of their texture, and their hydraulic properties were\nderived from W\u00f6sten et al. (1999). In V\u00e9z\u00e9nobres, the soil was medium-textured and\nbecause of the presence of a relatively high water table, the effective soil depth in terms of\nthe model was assumed to be 2.0 m (Table 2). The effect of assuming a large soil depth was\nto increase the amount of soil water available to the trees and the crop. In Silsoe, the soil\nwas clay (Burgess et al. 2004) and classified as \u201cfine-textured\u201d with a depth of 1.5 m.\n10\nManagement parameters\nThe management parameters within the Yield-SAFE model relate to the initial tree stand\ndensity, and the management of the trees and the crops (Tables 1, 3 and 4). The crop\nmanagement parameters comprised the choice of crop (Table 1) and the date of sowing\n(Table 4). The management parameters for the forestry systems were selected to be as close\nas possible to actual practice as determined during field visits and discussions with farmers\nat each site. At V\u00e9z\u00e9nobres and Silsoe, the forestry systems were planted at 204 and 156\npoplar trees ha-1 respectively.\nThe management parameters related to the trees include the timing and extent of pruning\n(Table 3). In many agroforestry systems, side branches arising from the main stem below a\ncertain height (the bole height) are pruned in order to maximise the volume of knot-free\ntimber. At each site, it was assumed that pruning took placed in increments of 1.0-1.5 m,\nensuring that the bole height was never more than 50-60% of the tree height, up to a\nmaximum height of 7-8 m (Table 3). The proportion of the shoots (\uf070s) pruned on each\noccasion were also assumed.\nThe silvoarable systems were parameterised so that they integrated the tree species of the\nforestry system with the crop species and rotation of the arable system. In V\u00e9z\u00e9nobres and\nSilsoe, the trees were arranged in rows, and the intercrop area was calculated by subtracting\na 2-m wide strip of aggregate tree row length in each system from the total area of the\nsystem. In V\u00e9z\u00e9nobres, these dimensions resulted in an intercrop area of 87.5% (16-m row\nwidth) and in Silsoe 80% (10-m row width).\n11\nTree and crop parameters\nThe parameters used to describe growth of different tree and crop species in Yield-SAFE\nwere determined from published material and the calibration of the model for \u201cpotential\u201d\ntree and crop yields (Van Ittersum and Rabbinge, 1997). An initial calibration of Yield-\nSAFE for \u201cpotential\u201d monoculture yields was undertaken against datasets of timber volume\nand crop yields under high yielding conditions in Atlantic and Mediterranean zones,\nassuming that light and temperature but not water, limited growth within the model. The\ntree parameters included initial values for the number of shoots per tree, biomass, and leaf\narea, and fixed values for radiation use efficiency, light extinction coefficient, and the\nrelative attrition rate of tree biomass (Table 3). The crop parameters included initial values\nfor leaf area and above-ground dry mass, and fixed values for radiation use efficiency, light\nextinction coefficient, specific leaf area, base temperatures and thermal time requirements\n(Table 4).\nCalibration of model by modification of three parameters\nThe fourth step in using the model was to adjust the value of no more than three parameters\nto improve the agreement between the model outputs and the available data. The three\nparameters that could be altered were the transpiration coefficient (the amount of water\ntranspired per unit of above-ground (crop) or woody (tree) biomass), the harvest index, and\na management factor (Table 5). The default value for the transpiration coefficient (0.28-\n0.65 m3 kg-1) varied with crop species (C3 v C4 plants) and the humidity of the agro-\necological zone (humid Atlantic zone v dry Mediterranean zone). Within the calibration\nexercise, the values for transpiration for an individual species were allowed to vary within\nthis range. The default value for the harvest index for the tree (proportion of above ground\nbiomass allocated to timber) was 0.5. Lastly a management factor (range: 50 to 100%),\nwhich was assumed to act directly on the radiation use efficiency could also be altered. The\n12\nfinal values used were considered to be within acceptable physiological boundaries (Graves,\n2005). This iterative process ensured that the mean modelled yield of the monoculture\narable crops matched the reference value for those crops, and the modelled monoculture tree\nyield matched the reference tree yield at final harvest.\nModel predictions and sensitivity analysis\nOnce calibrated, simulations were undertaken to determine the sensitivity of the modelled\ntree biomass to changes in management, such as tree spacing, and environmental conditions,\nsuch as soil depth. The densities examined varied from 50 to 1000 trees ha-1 for both the\nforestry and silvoarable systems, and the three soil depths examined were 0.5, 1.5, and 2.5\nm. In order to simplify the analysis of the results, no thinning or pruning was assumed in\nthe sensitivity analysis.\nIt has been common practice in agroforestry and intercropping studies to consider yield\nbenefits in terms of the land equivalent ratio (LER) (Mead and Willey, 1980; Ong, 1996;\nDupraz, 1998). The LER is typically defined as \u201cthe ratio of the area under sole cropping to\nthe area under the agroforestry system, at the same level of management that gives an equal\namount of yield\u201d (Ong, 1996) and can be used as a measure of the relative benefit of\ncalculated using:\nLER = \u0bcd\u0be5\u0bd8\u0bd8\u0003\u0be6\u0bdc\u0bdf\u0be9\u0be2\u0bd4\u0be5\u0bd4\u0bd5\u0bdf\u0bd8\u0003\u0bec\u0bdc\u0bd8\u0bdf\u0bd7\n\u0bcd\u0be5\u0bd8\u0bd8\u0003\u0be0 \u0be2\u0be1\u0be2\u0bd6\u0be8\u0bdf\u0be7\u0be8\u0be5\u0bd8\u0003\u0bec\u0bdc\u0bd8\u0bdf\u0bd7\n+ \u0bbc\u0be5\u0be2\u0be3\u0003\u0be6\u0bdc\u0bdf\u0be9\u0be2\u0bd4\u0be5\u0bd4\u0bd5\u0bdf\u0bd8\u0003\u0bec\u0bdc\u0bd8\u0bdf\u0bd7\n\u0bbc\u0be5\u0be2\u0be3\u0003\u0be0 \u0be2\u0be1\u0be2\u0bd6\u0be8\u0bdf\u0be7\u0be8\u0be5\u0bd8\u0003\u0bec\u0bdc\u0bd8\u0bdf\u0bd7\nEquation 1\nA second set of simulations was undertaken for a sensitivity analysis, to investigate which\nparameters dominated LER. To do this, the parameter values were altered by plus and\n13\nminus 10% of their nominal values and the resulting tree and crop yield stored. Having\ncalculated the LER, the sensitivity was calculated using:\n\u0394\u0bec\n\u0394\u0be3\u0bdc\n= \u0bec(\u0be3\u0bdc\u0b3e\u03bf\u0be3\u0bdc)\u0b3f\u0bec\u123a\u0be3\u0bdc\u0b3f \u03bf\u0be3\u0bdc\u123b\n\u0b36\u03bf\u0be3\u0bdc\nEquation 2\nwhere \u0755(\u074c\u0745\u0d45 \u03bf\u074c )\u0745\u0003\u073d\u074a\u0740\u0003\u0755\u123a\u074c\u0745\u0d46 \u03bf\u074c \u123b\u0745y was the model output (e.g. LER) when only the ith\nparameter was changed by amount \u2206_pi whist the other parameters were kept at their\nnominal values. To avoid scale effects, the relative sensitivity or elasticity (eLER) of LER for\na specific parameter pi using with nominal values \u074c\u0b13\u0d25 and LER\u0d24\u0d24\u0d24\u0d24\u0d24\u0d24 was calculated using:\n\u0b50\u0741\u0b49\u0b56 = \u03bf\u0b50\u0b49\u0b56\u03bf\u0be3\u0bdc \u0be3\u0c2a\u0d24\u0d24\u0d24\u0b50\u0b49\u0b56\u0d24\u0d24\u0d24\u0d24\u0d24\u0d24 Equation 3\nThe systems assumed for the sensitivity analysis were identical to those developed for\nVezenobres and Silsoe, except that continuous wheat was assumed for the duration of the\nrotations.\nRESULTS\nModel outputs\nBecause the yield of the monoculture arable crop was calibrated to the reference value, the\nmean values for the crop yields matched the assumed reference values. However the annual\nvariation in the weather data resulted in substantial variation in the predicted annual yields.\nBecause the relative inter-annual variation in rainfall was greater than that for temperature\nand solar radiation, the yields at Silsoe were more closely correlated with the rainfall during\nthe cropping season (Fig. 3) than levels of solar radiation or temperature. By contrast,\n14\narable crop yields at V\u00e9z\u00e9nobres (data not shown) did not show this response, possibly\nbecause of the larger soil depth assumed and the greater autumn and winter rainfall.\nTree yields in a monoculture\nAs described previously, the tree models were calibrated so that the forestry monoculture\ngave the same final yield as the measured timber yields, e.g. 0.88 m3 tree-1 at 204 trees ha-1\nat 15 years after planting at V\u00e9z\u00e9nobre, and 2.41 m3 tree-1 at 156 trees ha-1 at 30 years after\nplanting at Silsoe. The results for V\u00e9z\u00e9nobres showed that the Yield-SAFE model predicted\nlower annual timber increments than those measured during initial growth, before\nconverging on the measured value in the final year of the tree rotation in year 15 (Fig. 4a);\nby contrast the predicted and reference results for the forestry system at Silsoe were more\nclosely matched (Fig. 4d). The under-prediction of timber volumes in the initial period of\ntree growth is probably a result of constraints within the Michaelis-Menten function.\nCrop and tree yields in silvoarable systems\nFollowing calibration for the monoculture system, the Yield-SAFE model was used to\ndescribe the annual change in tree and crop yields within the experimental agroforestry\nsystems at V\u00e9z\u00e9nobres (139 trees ha-1) and Silsoe (156 trees ha-1). At both sites, the model\npredicted a decline in relative crop yields that was similar to the experimental data (Fig. 4c\nand f). The decline in crop yields was relatively fast because the fast growth of the poplars\nmeant that they intercepted a major proportion of the incoming light early in the tree\nrotation.\nAt V\u00e9z\u00e9nobres the tree yields in the agroforestry system showed a similar pattern to the\nexperimental data in that the timber volume per tree in the silvoarable system eventually\nexceeded that of the forestry trees (Fig. 4b). One reason for this is that the silvoarable trees\nwere planted at a lower density than the forestry trees and were eventually able to intercept\n15\nmore light on a per tree basis. The final yield from the Yield-SAFE prediction (0.99 m3 tree-\n1) also closely matched that assumed for the silvoarable treatment (0.98 m3 tree-1). By\ncontrast, at Silsoe, the timber volumes in the silvoarable system (Fig. 4e) remained below\nthose in the forestry system, even though the tree densities were the same in both systems,\nbecause the yield in the agroforestry system was reduced by crop competition for water\n(Burgess et al. 2004). This reflected the measured data, and based on these measured data,\nthe assumed yield pattern for the silvoarable treatment, which was also less than that for the\nforestry treatment. Although the final Yield-SAFE prediction for the silvoarable system\n(2.20 m3 tree-1) was greater than that for the assumed response of the silvoarable treatment\n(1.85 m3 tree-1) which is based on an empirical poplar growth model of Yield Class 10 (Fig.\n4e), it is worth noting that this assumed silvoarable response is based on the early growth of\nthe trees, and is also uncertain. For example, it is possible that as the silvoarable trees\nbecome larger and rooting depth increases, the effect of crop competition for water may be\nreduced, so that the silvoarable tree growth then exceeds the currently assumed response.\nThis would prompt the need to increase the assumed Yield Class for the silvoarable\ntreatment, which would more closely match the Yield-SAFE prediction.\nModel predictions\nOnce it was clear that the Yield-SAFE model was capable of producing credible\nsimulations, the model was used to predict the responses of tree and crop yields to different\ntree densities and rooting depths.\nResponse to tree density\nWhen the water component of the Yield-SAFE model was turned off, the predicted tree\nvolumes from a forestry and silvoarable treatment at the same tree density resulted in the\n16\nsame tree yield (Fig 5 a,b,d,e). This would be expected as the model assumes that the only\neffect of the understorey crop on tree yield is to alter the available water in the soil. As\nwould be expected the volume of an individual tree decreased as the tree density increased,\nand the stand volume reached a plateau at high tree densities.\nWhen the water component of the Yield-SAFE model was turned on and assuming a soil\ndepth of 1.5 m, the model predicted substantial reductions in the tree and stand volumes for\nboth the forestry and agroforestry treatments. Both V\u00e9z\u00e9nobres and Silsoe are in areas of\nrelatively low rainfall, and drought stress is known to constrain tree growth at both sites.\nThe predicted tree volumes for a given density was less for the agroforestry than the forestry\nsystem because of the competition from the understorey crop for water.\nThe relative tree yield reduction due to drought stress (assuming a soil depth of 1.5 m) was\ngreater at the V\u00e9z\u00e9nobres site (15 year rotation), than at Silsoe (30 year rotation). The\nincreased sensitivity of the trees at the V\u00e9z\u00e9nobres site could be a result of the period of tree\nestablishment (when a tree crop is particularly sensitive to water competition) forming a\nproportionately greater part of the tree rotation. It could also be a result of the lack of\nsummer rainfall in Southern France when competition for water by the crops and the trees is\nmost acute.\nThe mean relative crop yield over the length of the tree rotation declined with tree density\n(Figure 5c and 5f) because of the reduced planting area, and light and water competition. At\nboth sites, when the water component of the Yield-SAFE model was turned on, the relative\nyield of the crop component was greater than that when the water component was turned-\n17\noff. This is because under the water-limiting conditions, tree growth is reduced (Figures 5\na,b,d,e) and hence there is greater resource availability for the understorey crop.\nResponse to soil depth\nAs would be expected, the Yield-SAFE model showed that trees and stand volume for a\ngiven stand density decreased as the soil depth became more shallow (Fig 6 a,b,d,e). The\ntrees at V\u00e9z\u00e9nobres were more sensitive to soil depth than those at Silsoe, probably because\nof the greater importance of the soil being able to store winter rainfall into the summer.\nThe crop yields within the agroforestry system were also sensitive to the soil depth (Fig 6c\nand 6d). However the effect of soil depth became less critical as the tree density increased.\nIt is assumed that this was because the additional water available in a deeper soil was\nincreasingly used by the tree component of the system.\nRelationship between tree yields and crop yields\nThe model was also used to determine the relationship between mean tree yields, crop\nyields, and soil depth. For both sites, the relationship between tree yield and crop yield was\ncurvilinear (Fig 7) because the capture of solar radiation and water increased from\nintegrating tree and crop production. Increasing the soil depth also increased the production\nboundary for each system, as this also allowed the trees and crops to capture more water.\nAs described earlier, the sensitivity of tree and crop production to soil depth seemed to be\ngreater at V\u00e9z\u00e9nobres than at Silsoe. The curves also indicate that the greatest improvement\nin resource use by integrating tree and crop production tends to occur within the forestry\nsystem, probably because a crop can most effectively increase resource capture in the initial\nyears of a forestry rotation before a full tree canopy is achieved. By contrast within the crop\ndominated systems, adding an additional tree tends to lead to an equivalent linear loss in\ncrop yield.\n18\nSensitivity analysis\nThe sensitivity analysis showed that the absolute value of most parameter sensitivities was\nless than 0.05 indicating relatively small effects on the LER of the silvoarable systems\n(Table 6). Of those dominant parameters showing sensitivities larger than 0.05, most were\ntree parameters (i.e. the light extinction coefficient (kt), the light use efficiency of the tree\n(\uf065t), the initial number of shoots per tree (Nt)o, the maximum leaf area per shoot (Am), and\nthe critical value at which transpiration starts to be reduced (pFcrit)t), whilst only one (the\nlight use efficiency (\uf065c)), was associated with crop and only for Silsoe.\nDISCUSSION\nAs noted previously, this paper aims to demonstrate the applicability of the Yield-SAFE\nmodel to: i) describe existing systems at two contrasting sites and to ii) predict the responses\nof trees and crops in novel arable, forestry and agroforestry systems. These are discussed\nbelow.\nApplicability of the model to describe existing systems\nA key concept behind the Yield-SAFE model was to minimise the number of modelled\nparameters, whilst being able to model tree and crop growth within arable, forestry and\nagroforestry systems. The parameterisation and calibration process comprised of two\nphases: parameterisation of the monoculture forestry and arable systems for \u201cpotential\u201d tree\nand crop yields in the absence of drought stress, and then calibration for \u201cactual\u201d\nmonoculture tree and crop systems assuming potential water constraints.\nThrough the calibration process, the mean \u201cactual\u201d yield of the modelled monoculture crop\nwas fixed to equal a measured or reference yield at each site. However inter-annual\n19\nvariability of the climate meant that the actual yield in a particular year varied around that\nmean. At Silsoe, where the assumed soil depth was 1.5 m, the modelled crop yield was\nclosely linked to the seasonal rainfall (Fig 3). Because the inter-annual variation in solar\nradiation and thermal time was relatively small, the inter-annual variation in crop yields due\nto radiation and temperature were also relatively small.\nAfter appropriate calibration of the monoculture situation, the Yield-SAFE model gave\ndescriptions of the growth and yield of trees and crops in the silvoarable systems that were\nsimilar to those measured at the two contrasting sites (Figs. 4a,b,d, and e). At each site the\nmodel predicted that crop yields steadily reduced as the trees grew and captured greater\namounts of solar radiation and available water in the soil. Increasing tree densities in the\nsilvoarable systems increased the capture of light and water by trees, to the detriment of the\ncrop. These observations indicate that Yield-SAFE can provide credible estimates of the\nbiomass yields and partitioning between crops and trees in silvoarable systems in a range of\nclimate and soil conditions, and for a range of tree and crop species. The Yield-SAFE\nmodel was also able to predict long-term changes between the relative growth of trees in\nforestry and agroforestry systems at both sites. Thus, the growth per tree in the silvoarable\nsystem at V\u00e9z\u00e9nobres (0.99 m3 tree-1 at 139 trees ha-1) eventually exceeded that in the\nforestry system (0.88 m3 tree-1 at 204 trees ha-1) (Figs. 4a and b), whilst in contrast at Silsoe,\nthe growth in the silvoarable systems (2.20 m3 tree-1 at 156 trees ha-1) was lower than that in\nthe forestry system (2.43 m3 tree-1 at 156 trees ha-1) (Figs. 4d and e).\nResponses to tree planting density\nThe Yield-SAFE model predicted that timber production per hectare increased as tree\ndensity increased, and that timber production per tree decreased as tree density increased\nbecause the available solar radiation and water resources were partitioned amongst fewer\n20\ntrees. This can have beneficial economic impacts, as in many countries, the value of timber\nof equivalent volume increases as tree size increases. Unfortunately the authors have been\nunable to find published data describing the relative growth of poplar trees at very low and\nhigh tree densities which would indicate if the increased timber volumes predicted by Yield-\nSAFE at low densities are \u201creasonable\u201d. Therefore one recommendation is the need for\nfurther literature searching and\/or experimental work to determine the growth of freely-\ngrown trees of species commonly grown in forestry and agroforestry systems.\nThe model was also used to predict the tree yield and crop yield profiles for different tree\ndensities. Such an analysis can be useful in comparing the effect of tree density on\nprofitability and feasibility (Graves et al. 2007), or selected environmental impacts (Palma et\nal., 2007a).\nRelationship between tree and crop yields\nIn each of the silvoarable systems, tree and crop yields were individually lower on a per\nhectare system basis than the crop yields in the arable system and the tree yields in forestry\n(Fig. 6). However the combined levels of production, for example in terms of biomass\nproduction, were higher when the trees and crops were grown together rather than as\nseparate systems (Fig. 7).\nAs noted previously, it has been common practice in agroforestry and intercropping studies\nto consider the land equivalent ratio (LER) (Mead and Willey, 1980; Ong, 1996; Dupraz,\n1998). In practice the calculated ratio is heavily influenced by the assumed sole-cropping\nregime. If the sole-cropping regime is sub-optimal for maximising the yield component\nbeing considered, then it can artificially inflate the LER of the agroforestry system. The\nability to investigate a range of tree densities using a model means that it can be possible to\n21\nidentify higher tree density \u201ccontrol\u201d treatments for the calculation of the denominator for\nthe tree component of the LER, compared to the data available experimentally. Hence the\nmaximum LER ratio suggested by Figure 7 of about 1.12 is less than that previously\nsuggested for the poplar-arable cropping system of 1.22-1.45 by Graves et al. (2007).\nSensitivity analysis\nMost of the dominant tree parameters (i.e. kt, \uf065t, (Nt)o, Am) had negative normalized\nsensitivities in that an increase of the parameter value would lead to a decrease in the LER.\nThus, although tree growth increased for larger values of these tree parameters, the negative\neffect on the crop as a result of increased shading by the tree caused an overall reduction in\nLER. However, (pFcrit)t, which is a measure of the critical soil water potential at which the\ntree starts to experience drought stress, showed a positive sensitivity. This means that the\neffect of an increase of (pFcrit)t on increased tree growth was greater than the negative effect\non crop growth, therefore increasing the LER of the silvoarable system.\nIn the case of the dominant crop parameter, an increase in the light use efficiency of the crop\n(\uf065c) led to an increase in the crop yield. However, because this increased competition for\nwater, the reduction in the tree yield was greater than the increase in crop yield, thus\nresulting in a negative sensitivity result, meaning that LER was reduced. This effect was\nonly dominant in V\u00e9z\u00e9nobres, where the overall LER was also significantly higher than in\nSilsoe.\nThe sensitivity results for the dominant tree parameters appear to be consistent with field\nexperience in silvoarable systems, in that crop yields are reduced as the trees capture more\nresources that would otherwise be available to the crop. The principal exception is the result\nfor (pFcrit)t, where an increased capacity of the tree to extract water from a dry soil increased\n22\nLER, because the tree was utilizing water unavailable to the crop. At present the Yield-\nSAFE model does not consider the root zone in two layers, i.e. a crop and tree root zone and\na tree only zone. In future versions of the model, it would be good to include this effect to\nbetter simulate the effects on LER for crop species with differing relative root depths. Some\ncrops are likely to be less complementary than others.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis paper describes the implementation of a biophysical tree and crop model, including the\nselection and measurement of sites to calibrate the model, the process of obtaining the input\ndata for the model, and the validation of the model. Only after the results from the model\nwere found to be credible, was the model used to predict the effect of different tree planting\ndensities on tree and crop yields, and lastly to provide predictions of the land equivalent\nratio.\nAgroforestry systems are an alternative method for increasing tree cover whilst maintaining\ncrop yields. In France and England they may provide a means of establishing trees where\nthey are scarce. However, since experimental data on silvoarable systems are rare in\nEurope, computer simulations are needed to provide an estimate of tree and crop yields in\nmixed systems. Once calibrated against reference arable and forestry yields for each site,\nYield-SAFE provided reasonable predictions of tree and crop yields in silvoarable systems\nin accordance with expert opinion and field measurements at sites in France and the UK.\nThe predicted LERs for modelled silvoarable systems were lower than LERs reported for\nfield experiments because of the capacity to consider a greater range of tree densities for the\nmonoculture tree system. However the calculated LERs are still greater than one and they\nshow that more harvestable biomass could be produced by combining trees and crops on the\n23\nsame area of land rather than growing them separately. When used in the way described\nhere, Yield-SAFE is able to provide useful predictions of yields in silvoarable systems,\nrelative to arable and forestry systems, throughout Europe. The model-based approach\npresented in this paper could potentially be used to help illuminate current debates on how\nland should be used to meet competing demands for fuel, food, and fibre.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis research was carried out as part of the SAFE (Silvoarable Agroforestry for Europe)\ncollaborative research project.
