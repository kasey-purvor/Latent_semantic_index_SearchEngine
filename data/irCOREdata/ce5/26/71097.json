A statistical analysis has been made of the inci-\ndence of auroral radio absorption events at South Pole, and\nof its dependence on basic geophysical parameters such as\nseason, time of day, and magnetic activity level. It is found\nthat at low and moderate levels of activity the incidence of\nevents in the winter season is at least twice that in the sum-\nmer. However, at high activity no events at all occurred dur-\ning the local summer night, which appears to be explicable\nas the effect of the magnetotail and the consequent distortion\nof the magnetosphere when the southern polar region is tilted\nstrongly towards the Sun. Previous results from even higher\nlatitudes show the effect in an even more exaggerated form,\nin that both the day and night periods of absorption activity\nexhibit strong seasonal variations.\nKeywords. Ionosphere (Auroral ionosphere; Particle pre-\ncipitation) \u2013 Magnetospheric physics (Magnetotail)\n1 Introduction\nThe incidence of auroral radio absorption, normally observed\nwith riometers, is essentially zonal with an occurrence max-\nimum at or near 67\u25e6 geomagnetic latitude (L\u223c7). The width\nof the absorption zone, assuming a Gaussian form of dis-\ntribution, is about \u00b17\u25e6 on average. The magnitude and the\nrate of occurrence of absorption events at these latitudes vary\nstrongly with the level of disturbance as indicated by in-\ndices such as Kp and Ap, and the latitude of the maximum\nalso changes with the intensity of the disturbance, moving\ndown in latitude if the activity becomes more intense. The\noccurrence statistics of auroral absorption were thoroughly\ninvestigated in the earlier years of riometer studies (Harg-\nreaves, 1969a) with the emphasis placed on the activity at\nand around the latitudes of maximum occurrence, but also\nCorrespondence to: J. K. Hargreaves\n(j.hargreaves@lancaster.ac.uk)\nincluding the magnetic latitude of South Pole (Hargreaves\net al., 1964; Hargreaves and Cowley, 1967a). At the higher\nmagnetic latitudes statistical investigations tend to be more\ndifficult because the absorption events are smaller and less\nfrequent. However, studies which have been made (e.g. Gill-\nmor and Hargreaves, 1963; Satterblom et al., 1967) show\nsome interesting features which are not evident at the lower\nlatitudes.\nConjugate-point observations made between the Cana-\ndian Arctic and the Antarctic in the 1960s (Hargreaves and\nChivers, 1965; Hargreaves and Cowley, 1967b) revealed a\nseasonal variation in the relative intensity of conjugate ab-\nsorption events, their magnitude tending to be greater in the\nwinter hemisphere. This effect was strong at the magnetic\nlatitude of South Pole (L\u223c14) and less strong, though still\nclearly present, at the latitude of Byrd Station (L\u223c7). No\nsuch effect was apparent between Eights Station (L=4) and\nits conjugate. The effect could be due (i) to a seasonal dif-\nference in electron precipitation and\/or in the atmospheric\nresponse to the precipitation, (ii) to a relative shift in the po-\nsition of the occurrence zone, or to a combination of these\nfactors. A subsequent investigation using spaced riometers at\nL\u223c7 (Hargreaves, 1969b) suggested that both kinds of cause\nplayed some part at stations near the latitude of peak oc-\ncurrence. The situation regarding higher latitudes has never\nbeen resolved, however.\nThe purpose of the present study is to investigate in greater\ndetail the incidence of auroral absorption at South Pole and\nhigher magnetic latitudes, with particular regard to the influ-\nences of season and activity level.\n2 Data\nRiometer data from South Pole recorded over the three-year\nperiod 1990\u20131992 were inspected for the occurrence of ab-\nsorption events peaking at or above a selected magnitude.\nPublished by Copernicus GmbH on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n712 J.

Incidence of auroral absorption events exceeding the thresh-\nold value at South Pole according to the time of day. Magnetic\nmidnight and noon are at about 04:00 and 16:00 UT, respectively.\nThe ordinate gives the total number of days in an average year that\nan event occurred in an hour.\nThe riometers operated at 38.2 MHz in 1990 and 1991, and\nat 51.4 MHz in 1992. The threshold was set at 0.3 dB for\n1992, and at 0.54 dB in 1990\u20131991, both of these limits be-\ning equivalent to 0.88 dB at 30 MHz. The basic method was\nsimply to note the hour and month when events exceeding the\nthreshold occurred, and the magnetic activity index Ap for\nthat day. Days showing polar-cap absorption and any with\npoor quality data, for whatever reason, were disregarded. In\nstudies of the monthly incidence, the count was multiplied\nby 30\/N, where N is the number of days inspected, thereby\ncorrecting the incidence to a standard month of 30 days.\n3 Results\n3.1 Diurnal variation\nPrevious work has shown that at the latitude of South Pole the\nevents occur principally within separate night and day peri-\nods, the incidence being low for 2\u20133 h in the early morning\nand the early evening (Hargreaves et al., 1964). The same\nfeatures are seen in the present results (Fig. 1), in which\nthe ordinate is the number of events within the hour over\none year. At South Pole magnetic time is about 4 h behind\nUT. The \u201cnight group\u201d therefore extends from about 16:00\nto 02:00 magnetic time, and the \u201cday group\u201d from 04:00 to\n13:00 magnetic time, each occupying periods of 9 or 10 h\nand centred about 4 h before magnetic midnight and noon,\nrespectively. These groups are marked on Fig. 1.\n3.2 Seasonal variation\nFigure 2a shows the event occurrence month by month, in\ntotal and for the day and night periods separately. These\nare averages over all three years, 1990\u20131992. There is a\nstrong indication of a seasonal variation, in that relatively\nmore days with absorption activity occur during the months\nof the southern winter than during the summer. The effect\nis most marked in the night period. There are substantial\nvariations from year to year, no doubt in part statistical but\npossibly also related to variations in the general levels of geo-\nphysical activity.\n3.3 Variations with Ap\nAccording to previous studies the general level of auroral ab-\nsorption varies with the magnetic activity as measured by the\nstandard magnetic indices. The event magnitude depends on\nKp \u2013 log(absorption) \u221dKp \u2013 (Hargreaves, 1966). Also the\nincidence of events (exceeding some threshold magnitude)\nin monthly periods is essentially linear with Ap(m), this lat-\nter being the monthly mean of the daily magnetic index Ap\n(Hargreaves et al., 1987).\nFigure 3 illustrates the percentage incidence of days hav-\ning at least one absorption event, according to the season and\nmonth. The plot has been smoothed, and it clearly shows that\nboth magnetic activity and month are major factors.\nThe incidence of absorption at South Pole is shown in\nFig. 4 as a function of Ap, where the results are given for\nthe four season\/time-of-day groups as well as for the total.\nThe day and night periods are, respectively, 08:00\u201317:00 and\n20:00\u201306:00 UT (Fig. 1), and the winter and summer seasons\nare May\u2013September and November\u2013March (Fig. 2a).\nPanel (b) includes all days having good data, and shows\nthat if other factors are disregarded the probability of there\nbeing at least one event in the day increases linearly with\nAp overall. Given the linearity between event occurrence\nand Ap, some correction for the variation of magnetic activ-\nity may be applied to the observed monthly incidence. Thus,\nFig. 2b shows the ratio of occurrence toAp(m), whereAp(m)\nis the monthly mean of the Ap values for the days inspected.\nThe patterns are not altered significantly by this correction,\nwhich confirms that the essential seasonal variation of occur-\nrence is not an artifact due to activity variations from month\nto month. (The month of December is anomalous for the\ndaytime period, however.)\nPanels 4c to f also show significant daily and seasonal vari-\nations. For Ap values up to 25, the ratio between the per-\ncentage probability of an event occurring and Ap is 1.1 for\nwinter day, 2.4 for winter night, 0.5 for summer day and 0.4\nfor summer night. In this respect summer night and day are\nabout the same, but the probability for winter day is about\ntwice as much, and that for winter night is more than twice\nas much again. Overall, the winter has significantly more ab-\nsorption activity than the summer at the same level of Ap. It\nAnn. Geophys., 25, 711\u2013720, 2007 www.ann-geophys.net\/25\/711\/2007\/\nJ. K.

The plot shows the number of days per year hav-\ning at least one absorption event exceeding the threshold in a given\nmonth. The data have been corrected to a uniform \u201c30-day month\u201d.\nSummer and winter periods are marked.\nshould be kept in mind that there are fewer data points at the\nhigher disturbance levels, and hence greater statistical varia-\ntion.\nAlthough there are relatively few days with very high dis-\nturbance, the probability of at least one event occurring dur-\ning the whole day seems to approach unity if all seasons and\ntimes of day are included together. Specifically, if Ap>60\nthe probability of there being at least one event in the day\nis 0.78, and for Ap>70 it is 0.93. Our sample has 23 and\n14 days in these categories respectively. For comparison,\na similar analysis of event incidence at the Abisko station\n(L=5.6), which is much closer to the maximum of the ab-\nsorption zone, showed that Ap needed to exceed only about\n15 for the daily incidence there to approach unity (Hunsucker\nand Hargreaves, 2003).

Since the absorption is relatively weak and events\nrelatively infrequent, it is more difficult to establish reliable\nstatistics for these latitudes. Nevertheless, some published\nresults from Mirnyy and McMurdo (Table 3) are of interest to\nthe present topic. Figure 5 shows the occurrence of 30 MHz\nabsorption events at Mirnyy and McMurdo.\nIn the Mirnyy investigation the threshold was set at 0.3 dB\nat a radio frequency of 30 MHz (Gillmor and Hargreaves,\n1963). Less than a year\u2019s full data (from March 1961 to Jan-\nuary 1962) were available, and the winter period (Fig. 5a)\ncovers 1 May\u201315 September, a total of 4 1\/2 months, while\nsummer (Fig. 5b) is represented by the 3 months November\u2013\nJanuary inclusive. These were the first observations of au-\nroral radio-absorption events to be made in the Antarctic,\nand the authors pointed out that the diurnal pattern of oc-\ncurrence changed with the season. Figures 5a and b clearly\nindicate a preference for the night period in winter, and for\nthe day period (though the incidence is small) in the summer.\nAnn.

The\nobservations of Satterblom et al. (1967) covered 5 years from\n1962\u20131967, and the incidence of events exceeding 0.25 dB\n(at 30 MHz) was only 5.6 per month on average. Figures 5c\nand d take May to September as winter and November to\nMarch as summer, each a period of 5 months duration. The\ndata from all 5 years are included. Again we see a clear pref-\nerence for night activity in the winter and for day activity\nin the summer. The day and night periods marked on Fig. 5c\ncover approximately 07:00\u201314:00 and 21:00\u201303:00 magnetic\ntime. Satterblom et al. remarked that September appeared to\nbe a transitional month between the summer and winter pat-\nterns.\nIn neither of these studies did the analysis take account\nof Ap, so we do not know at what level of disturbance the\nevents were seen or the asymmetry began to operate. How-\never, since the effect is present in the total set of data, it pre-\nFig. 6. Map of Antarctic continent with stations South Pole (SPA),\nMirnyy (MIR) and McMurdo (MCM), and constant L contours.\nsumably operates at virtually all activity levels for which au-\nroral absorption occurs at these very high latitudes.\nThere is an element of consistency between the results\nfrom South Pole, Mirnyy and McMurdo, which may be ap-\npreciated from the geography. In Fig. 6 the L-values are su-\nperposed on a map of the Antarctic (after Hargreaves, 1967),\nwith the observing sites marked as SPA, MIR, and MCM re-\nspectively. At midnight UT the Sun is on the 180\u25e6 merid-\nian of geographical longitude, and relative to the map it\nmoves 15\u25e6 westward each hour. For each of the stations the\nmagnetic-night period of absorption occurs when the station\nis on the opposite side of the magnetic pole (*) from the Sun.\nFor Pole and Mirnny the time when the Sun, the magnetic\npole, and the station are aligned comes near the end of the\nnight period of event incidence (Figs. 1 and 5). The situation\nis slightly different for McMurdo, when the alignment falls\nnearer the middle of the period. During the day periods, sta-\ntions are on the sunward side of the magnetic pole and similar\nconsiderations apply. In the summer season, when the pole\nis tilted toward the Sun, the night period of activity virtually\nvanishes at the highest latitudes, while at South Pole it van-\nishes at high activity. In the winter, when the pole is tilted\naway from the Sun, it is the the day period of activity which\nvanishes at the highest latitudes (though not at South Pole).\n5 A basic explanation\nIt is suggested that the lack of absorption during summer\nnights at South Pole is a consequence of the changing geom-\netry of the magnetotail resulting from the seasonal change\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/25\/711\/2007\/ Ann.

Shiokawa).\nin the orientation of the magnetosphere with respect to the\nsolar wind. The point is illustrated in Fig. 7 by means of\nsimplified models of the geomagnetic field, comprising just a\ndipole field plus a tail field. The tail field is assumed to com-\nmence at 5RE and to run parallel to the ecliptic plane (i.e.\nin the Sun-Earth direction). This \u201chinging\u201d of the tail goes\nback to the earliest attempts to model the effect of the tail on\nthe shape of the magnetosphere (e.g. Speiser and Ness, 1967)\nand most workers have made the connection at 8 or 10RE .\nThe closer distance of 5RE has been used here because ob-\nservations indicate that the substorm in auroral absorption\nin the night sector begins at about L=5 (Hargreaves et al.,\n1975). However, the value is tapered from zero at 5RE to\nthe full value at 8RE . The tail fields have been selected as\n3.1, 6.2, 9.3, 12.4, 15.5 and 18.6 nT, these being convenient\nfractions (1.10\u22124 to 6.10\u22124) of the Earth\u2019s dipole field at the\nequator.\nAt magnetic midnight in midsummer, the geomagnetic\nequator in the anti-solar direction lies at an angle some 39\u25e6\nbelow the ecliptic plane. If the tail field (BT ) is zero, the\nfield-lines from magnetically conjugate points in Northern\nand Southern Hemispheres join as expected and conjugacy is\npreserved. The addition of a tail field moves the point where\na selected field-line meets the neutral sheet further out, the\nextension being greater in the Southern Hemisphere. Table 4\ngives the intersection not with the neutral sheet but with a\nline three Earth-radii from it, representing the thickness of a\ntypical plasma sheet. In the southern summer (northern win-\nter) the line from the south meets the sheet several earth-radii\nfurther down the tail than the northern line, and the difference\nincreases with the magnitude of the tail field. When the field\nreaches about 20 nT (in this model!) the southern line is ef-\nfectively open, whereas the northern line still connects into\nTable 4.

(For the table, the\ncomputations were extended to 31 and 62 nT, equivalent to\nfractions 1.10\u22123 and 2.10\u22123.)\nWhen it is midwinter in the south, the geomagnetic equa-\ntor is above the ecliptic but only by 8\u25e6. The effect then works\nin the opposite direction but to a lesser extent (Fig. 8). The\nseparations between northern and southern intersections with\nthe plasma sheet are smaller, and the tail field has to be con-\nsiderably larger before the southern (winter) line opens. For\nthe lines L=20 and 30 the effects are greater.\nIn this study the activity level has been quantified by the\nmagnetic disturbance index Ap, and the relation between BT\nand Ap is not well defined though observations have indi-\ncated a tendency for them to increase together. Early ob-\nservations revealed the tail field to be larger on average for\nhigher values of the Kp index. Values such as 8\u201325 nT\nwere quoted for conditions when Kp\u22642-, and of 10\u201330 nT\nat greater Kp, with 40 nT seen only during the largest distur-\nbances (Behannon and Ness, 1966). A doubling of tail field\n(to 30 nT) was reported at the sudden commencement (SC)\nof a storm in which Kp rose to 6 (Ness and Williams, 1966).\nIn the present analysis anAp value of 35 appears to be signif-\nicant. This would be roughly equivalent to Kp\u223c4, at which\nBT would (typically) be considerably enhanced.\nMore recently, Shiokawa et al. (2005) used GEOTAIL data\nfrom the years 1995\u20132000 to investigate fluctuations of mag-\nnetic field at 8 to 11 Earth-radii during substorms. Figure 9\nshows the values of BT just before the substorm against the\nvalue ofAp on that day. (In some cases the observed value of\nBT may have been reduced by the pressure due to the plasma\nwithin the tail.) The correlation between these quantities is\nagain poor. There is a large range of BT at any selected value\nofAp, but the tendency for it to increase withAp is apparent:\nthere is a lack of large values of BT ifAp is small , and a lack\nof small values of BT if Ap is large. On this evidence, also,\nthe tail field is likely to be enhanced if Ap exceeds 35.\nAnn. Geophys., 25, 711\u2013720, 2007 www.ann-geophys.net\/25\/711\/2007\/\nJ. K. Hargreaves: Seasonal variations in the incidence of auroral radio absorption events 719\nThe simple calculations in this section should not be mis-\ntaken for an accurate model of the magnetotail. They are\nintended only to illustrate a principle, and for a first-order\ncomparison with the observations. The agreement seems as\ngood as can be expected.\n6 Summary and discussion\nThe concept that field-lines originating at high latitude are\nswept back into the tail goes back many years, and it was\nearly recognised that the details would be largely determined\nby the intensity of the tail field. Model computations by Bar-\nish and Roederer (1969) predicted that at L\u223c7 (Byrd station)\nthere would be conjugate displacements for the smaller val-\nues of tail field but that the field lines would be open if the\ntail field was large. Evidence for the opening of the field-\nlines has not, however, been observed in riometer data from\nL=7. The higher latitude of South Pole would be expected\nto be more susceptible to the effect, and the present anal-\nysis suggests that, being observed at high disturbance level\nonly, and in summer but not in winter, it is just beginning to\nshow up at that latitude. L\u224814 is a transitional latitude in this\nsense.\nAt lower disturbance levels, when the fieldlines go back\nto the central tail, the event incidence is observed to be ap-\nproximately proportional to the Ap index, and there are at\nleast twice as many events (exceeding a given magnitude)\nin the winter as in the summer. The preference for winter\nis consistent with the conjugate-point observations of Harg-\nreaves and Chivers (1965) which showed the absorption to\nbe generally stronger in the winter hemisphere of the L=14\nconjugate pair. The displacement of plasma-sheet connection\npoints (Table 4) may well be a factor.\nThe observations at L-values of 20 and more show that an\neven stronger seasonal effect operates at these very high mag-\nnetic latitudes. There is good consistency between the results\nfrom Mirnyy and McMurdo, in that the night group of events\nin each case weakens or disappears in the local summer, and\nthe day group vanishes in the local winter. At these latitudes\nthe whole data set is affected, not just the periods with high-\nest magnetic activity.\nA simple model, produced by adding a tail field to the\nEarth\u2019s dipole, can explain the night effect in terms of the\nchanging configuration of the magnetotail when the southern\npole is tilted towards the Sun. The use of absorption statistics\nfrom high-latitude sites in conjunction with field modelling\nappears to offer further scope for studying the connection be-\ntween high-latitude ground stations and active regions of the\nmagnetotail.\nRecent auroral studies have investigated the influence of\nthe interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) on the motion (Ost-\ngaard et al., 2003) and conjugacy (Ostgaard et al., 2004;\nStubbs et al., 2005) of auroral phenomena. It would be of\ninterest to include IMF behaviour in further studies of ab-\nsorption at very high latitudes.\nAcknowledgements. I am grateful to T. J. Rosenberg and D. L.
