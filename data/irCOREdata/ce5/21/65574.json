The paper provides a \nhistorically embedded interpretation of Laos\u2019 contemporary economic geography through \nthree lenses: dualism, spatiality and scale. The paper proposes that while the patterns of \nchange in the country are familiar, the meaning of those patterns is linked to a series of spatial \nassociations, scalar disjunctures, historical contingencies, and cultural incongruities which are \nplace-based and country or region specific. The paper draws a distinction between national \nand trans-national governmentalities on the one hand, and \u2018village governmentalities\u2019 on the \nother, offering these as alternative, but not mutually exclusive, ways of viewing and \ninterpreting Laos\u2019 economic geography.   \n \nKey words \nLaos, history, transition, culture, inequality, space \n \nLaos: a particular place? \n \nUntil comparatively recently, Laos was a blank page and a black box \u2013 the invisible country \nof the Southeast Asian region. At a time when other countries of Southeast Asia were \nelbowing their way into the mainstream of development and into the mindsets of scholars and \npolicy makers, Laos was in danger of simply sinking from view. Most economic studies of \nthe Southeast Asian region, for example, either ignored Laos entirely or, having noted that the \ncountry was a geographical component of the region, were either unable or unwilling to say \nmuch more. This state of affairs, in which Laos languished as the \u2018forgotten\u2019 country of \n 2\nSoutheast Asia, essentially extended from the beginning of the development era in the 1960s, \nthrough to the early 1990s. \n \nThe reasons why Laos was in danger of slipping off the page were, essentially, a combination \nof the country\u2019s international insignificance; the isolationist policies pursued by the Lao \nPeople\u2019s Revolutionary Party until the late 1980s; the response of the international \ncommunity to the victory of the communist Pathet Lao in 1975; the belief in some quarters \nthat Laos was not a country at all but a cartographic accident; and the difficulties and dangers \nof undertaking research in a country that was embroiled in a war for long years and around \nwhich travel was difficult and often impossible. \n \nThe first grounded study of Lao rural society to be published since 1975 was Grant Evans\u2019 \nLao peasants under socialism (1990; and see Evans, 1995). Even he, however, could only \nundertake research in villages close to the capital, Vientiane. For nearly two decades then, \nfrom the early 1970s to the early 1990s, at a time when other countries in the Southeast Asian \nregion were being intensively researched and scrutinised, knowledge of Laos was actually \ndiminishing as studies and data aged. Many of the country\u2019s small educated elite, furthermore, \nfled to Thailand following the victory of the Pathet Lao, leaving the country with a woefully \nthin base of educated women and men. A report prepared by the Lao government in 1989 for \na Least Developed Countries round table meeting in Geneva had to admit that even the GDP \nestimates for the country were \u201conly approximate\u201d (GoL, 1989, page 10) and this lack of \nknowledge extended to many other of the country\u2019s \u201ckey physical, social, economic and \nclimatic variables\u201d (UNDP, 1990). Even government offices in Vientiane are said to \u201crely \nmore on guesswork than real data\u201d (Vatthana Pholsena and Banomyong, 2006, page 74). \nWhile there is a surprisingly substantial literature on Laos \u2013 a recent bibliography, for \nexample, extends to 1,385 pages (Gay et al, 2003) \u2013 compared with other countries of the \nregion the knowledge base on which a contemporary economic geography can be built, is \nlimited. \n 3\n Making Laos special? Policy, global integration and regional differentiation \n \nLaos (Figure 1) is a transitional economy. This is the title page and the leitmotif of the \ncountry\u2019s development project. Since the early 1980s, Laos has progressively been venturing \nfurther into the economic and political mainstream. Economically this is encapsulated in the \nreforms of the New Economic Mechanism (NEM), more evocatively termed Chin Thanakaan \nMai, or \u2018New Thinking\u2019, which comprise, in summary (Rigg, 2005): \n \n\u2022 A move to a market determination of prices and resource allocation \n\u2022 A shift from central planning to guidance planning \n\u2022 An elimination of subsidies and introduction of monetary controls \n\u2022 An alignment of the domestic currency with the market rate \n\u2022 A decentralisation of control to industries and lower levels of government \n\u2022 The encouragement of the private sector \n\u2022 The encouragement of foreign investment \n \nThe policies of the NEM can be neatly mapped onto the generic Washington consensus \n(Table 1; and see Rigg, 2005, page 23) and the capital, Vientiane, is dotted with the offices of \nthe multilateral agencies and agents of these institutions are intimately involved in the \nformulation of the country\u2019s development policies. We see in Laos, therefore \u2013 or at least at \nfirst glance \u2013 an incorporation of one of the world\u2019s poorest countries into a policy milieu \nwhich has as its intellectual and political heart an ideology of development that is Western in \nboth its geography (it comes from the West) and in its intellectual provenance (it is of the \nWest). It seems, on this basis, that the term \u2018Eurocentric\u2019, can be applied in spades to Laos\u2019 \nrecent development. Side-by-side with this process of economic mainstreaming, at a regional \nlevel we see the incorporation, politically, of Laos into the Association of Southeast Asian \n 4\nNations (Asean), which the country joined in 1997. The habit of attending Asean meetings \nand contact and communication between officials at high and mid-levels has served to ingrain \na sense of regional identity and common purpose. Taken together, and it would seem that the \neconomic will of the NEM\/Washington consensus and the political exigencies of belonging to \nAsean have drawn Laos inexorably into the mainstream. The policies of economic \ndevelopment in Laos are formed and formulated on the basis of a global intellectual current \ncentred on Washington, tempered by a regional political framework informed by the Asean \n\u2018way\u2019. \n \nBut the development story in Laos is not a simple one of submission to global economic \nstrictures and forces, and regional political incorporation. There are two other stories to \ntell that serve to unsettle this neat picture of global and regional integration. First, there is \na story of Lao exceptionalism and a concerted effort to maintain the distinctiveness of \nLaos in the wider regional and global context. And second, there is a local narrative of \nincorporation and inclusion which rubs up against the higher level debates and visions. To \nunderstand the first, it is necessary to excavate quite deeply into the country\u2019s pre-\ncolonial, colonial and post-colonial pasts (See: Stuart-Fox, 1993, 1996, and 2006; Jerndal \nand Rigg, 1998; Vatthana Pholsena and Lockhart, 2006; and Lockhart, 2006). And to \nappreciate the second \u2013 and this comes later in the paper \u2013 it is necessary to ask what \nhappens to policies and pronouncements as they enter local spaces and make the \ntransition from rhetoric to policy, from policy to practice, and from practice to experience. \n \nA Lao historiography \n \nAt the real risk of collapsing and simplifying Lao history, prior to the late 19th century the \narea that we now call \u2018Laos\u2019 was a site of tussle and conflict between competing regional \npowers and, in particular, Siam (Thailand) and Vietnam. There were, to be sure, powers and \nprincipalities that arose in the lands of Laos and which had some influence but to say that \n 5\n\u2018Laos\u2019 existed prior to the 20th century would be to stretch a point. The French colonisation of \nthe lands of present-day Laos \u2013 more by accident than design \u2013 did little to change this state \nof affairs and forge a sense of Lao identity. The French treated Laos as the resource-rich \nannex to their more important possessions over the Annamite mountains, in Vietnam. In fact, \nthey had plans, which came to nought, to subsume Laos within a Greater Vietnam. During the \nSecond World War, the government of Siam, in their attempts to achieve their objective of \ncreating a Greater Thailand based on a pan-Thai nationalist agenda, annexed two portions of \nLao territory in 1941 (Ivarsson et al, 1995, page 13). In response to the threat from the west, \nfrom 1941 the French Vichy government in Hanoi began to engender a sense of Lao national \nidentity, marking the \u201cfirst serious attempt to create an unprecedented national space in Laos \nand\u2026.a modernist nationalist discourse on Laos and the Lao\u201d (Ivarsson, 1999, page 76). \nHaving survived the Second World War without being absorbed by Siam or integrated into \nVietnam, and then having achieved independence from France in 1954, the country was \ndivided by a civil war for more than two decades. A US-backed Royalist government based in \nVientiane controlled the lowlands of the Mekong valley, while the Hanoi-supported Pathet \nLao operated across much of the rest of the country. Only in 1975 was Laos finally reunified \nunder a communist government, with the full and final victory of the Pathet Lao. \n \nWith this history in mind, it is scarcely surprising that one of the themes of Lao government \npolicy since 1975 has been to cement in the population\u2019s minds and in the regional context \nthe notion that Laos exists and, moreover, has done so for many centuries. The official, 1,300-\npage Pravatsat Lao or History of Laos published in 2000 (see Lockhart, 2006) provides a \nhistorical narrative that transcends ethnic difference, and links the present with a \n(reconstructed) past. As Lockhart says, this official history has \u201cno shortage of artificial or \neven fictional elements that stretch historical credibility to breaking point\u201d (2006, page 377). \nIt also, though, provides a \u2018counter-discourse\u2019 to the view that has sometimes emanated from \nThailand, promulgated by Thai historians, that there is a pan-Thai (or pan-Tai) civilisation \n 6\nthat reaches north and east into Laos and China (Vatthana Pholsena and Lockhart, 2006, page \n335; and see Vatthana Pholsena, 2006). \n \nSo, we can see in Lao government\/party policy a concerted attempt to \u2018create\u2019 Laos, for two \nsets of constituents; for the Lao people themselves (i.e. for those within), and for the \ninternational community (i.e. for those without). Over the last three decades, Laos has \nacquired a history and the peoples of Laos have acquired at least the pretence of a common \nbond that links them to each other rather than to groups residing in neighbouring countries. \nHowever in papering over Laos\u2019 multi-ethnic past and in denying the country\u2019s ethnic \nminorities a history that can be told separately from that of the country as a whole, ructions \nhave been created (see Lockhart, 2006).  \n \nFrom neat histories to messy presents: three approaches to discerning economic \ngeographies of Laos \n \nThis introduction has, so far, been Laos-centric. But the paper is not only intended to add to \nour rather meagre knowledge of Laos. I also wish to use the country as a stage on which to \nrehearse, and reflect on, discussions of \u2018trans-national governmentalities\u2019 and \u2018village \ngovernmentalities\u2019. The first of these is exemplified in the work of Ferguson (2005) and \nFerguson and Gupta (2002) and, in writing of trans-national governmentalities, they are \nreferring to \u201c\u2026not only new strategies of discipline and regulation, exemplified by the WTO \nand the structural adjustment programs implemented by the IMF, but also transnational \nalliances forged by activists and grassroots organizations and the proliferation of voluntary \norganizations supported by complex networks of international and transnational funding and \npersonnel\u201d (Ferguson and Gupta, 2002, page 990). The notion of village governmentalities, \nmeanwhile, picks up on discussions over village transnationalism and highlights the way in \nwhich people \u2013 individuals and households \u2013 often separated across space, are deeply \n 7\nconnected. While trans-national governmentality focuses on the transnational network, village \ngovernmentality focuses on the nodal points, viewing these as containers of human agency.  \n \nReturning to the discussion of Laos, three entry points are provided for an examination of \nLaos\u2019 economic geography. First of all, it is possible to focus on the dualisms in Lao society, \nof which the most pertinent in the context of this discussion are between the Lao, as an ethnic \ngroup, and the various non-Lao minorities; and between Laos and Thailand. The second entry \npoint focuses on patterns of economic activity in the country \u2013 in other words, on Laos\u2019 \neconomic geography, in the classical sense. The third entry point engages with the distinction \nbetween policy and practice\/experience, or between economic geographies seen from the \nperspective of the village and the rice field, and economic geographies viewed from Vientiane, \nthrough the lens of planning documents and government pronouncements. \n \nClearly, another set of entry points could have been selected \u2013 there are many ways to cut the \nLaotian cake: evolving relations with China, the political economy of resource plunder, and \nenvironmental degradation, for instance. Those selected here, though, are seen to touch on \nkey issues that both resonate with the Lao experience and relate to wider geographical debates. \nMoreover, it is through considering such wider concerns that it becomes evident that the entry \npoints are not isolated one from the other, but linked. In particular, they cut through two \ndebates: that over space, place and scale; and, second, the debate over society and economy \n(see Jonas, 2006; Mansfield, 2005; Marston et al, 2005). In this way, the entry points can be \nseen operating in the context of several competing, though not mutually exclusive, scalar \ndiscourses: \n \n\u2022 A global discourse of economic reform and market integration which has Laos \nentering and becoming part of the mainstream \n\u2022 A regional discourse of Laos as a component part of a wider Southeast Asian region, \nwhere an Asian identity creates and cements a common purpose \n 8\n\u2022 A national discourse of Lao exceptionalism, which separates the country from its key \nneighbour, Thailand, and which has its roots in centuries of interaction, contact and \nconflict \n\u2022 And a sub-national, centre\/periphery discourse which highlights the differences \nbetween the centre \u2013 the capital, Vientiane \u2013 and local spaces \n \nEntry point #1: Lao dualisms \n \nWhat are the pertinent dualisms in Laos today? The obvious framing would be in terms of \nmodern\/traditional, lowland\/upland and, possibly, global\/national. I wish to suggest that a \nmore instructive pair of dualisms \u2013 and by instructive, I mean illuminating \u2013 is between \nLaos\/Thailand and Lao\/non-Lao. As will become clear, both these dualism touch in important \nways on the historiography rehearsed above. History informs economic geography; economic \npolicy reflects certain historical antecedents; and these policies, in turn, serve to re-shape \ncontemporary economic geographies. \n \nIn the Thai capital, Bangkok, there remains a tendency to Thai-ify Laos: to see the country as \na cultural and historical component of Greater Thailand. Unlike the usual debate over \ndifference in the mainstream literature, which emphasises the East-West dichotomy, in Laos \nconcern revolves around relations with Thailand. This, ironically, is not because of the latent \ndifferences between Laos and Thailand, but because of the two countries\u2019 similarities. \nThailand and Laos\u2019 histories, or the histories of those spaces that we now call Thailand and \nLaos, have intersected at key junctures over the centuries and their peoples share a language, \nreligion and many other social and cultural commonalities.1 Thailand is also, however, the \nregional super-power so this relationship is not one of equals. Thailand is Laos\u2019 greatest \n                                                 \n1 This is a simplification because Thailand and Laos, the latter particularly, are far from being \nhomogeneous countries themselves. Nonetheless, the broad point is germane. \n \n 9\ninvestor, largest trading partner, hundreds of thousands of Lao nationals work in Thailand, \nand the baht is used as currency in day-to-day financial transactions, along with the US$ and \nthe Lao kip.2 Thailand\u2019s presence in Laos ranges from these tangible elements that we can \nmeasure and track \u2013 money, labour, commodities, and so forth \u2013 to the more intangible. Grant \nEvans (1998, pages 108-113), for example, notes how Thai royalty support development \nprojects in Laos in much the same way that they do in Thailand and how pictures of the Thai \nroyal family or calendars with images of Thai royalty adorn people\u2019s houses and shops. It is \nas if, Grant says, \u201cthe Thai king had become a proxy for Lao royalty\u201d (1998, page 113). In \neveryday contact, Thai and Lao reveal a level of engagement which reaches beyond normal \ncommunication between neighbours: \u201cWhen someone from Thailand meets a Lao, he almost \ninstinctively refers to himself as elder brother (phii) in the same way that a Bangkok citizen \nwould do when meeting someone from Thailand\u2019s own periphery\u201d (Ivarsson et al, 1995, \npages 24-5). The implication would seem to be that many Thai \u2013 often without realising \u2013 \nregard the Lao of Laos as they do the Lao of the Northeastern region of Thailand.  \n \nInevitably, the Lao government is highly sensitive to any insinuation that Laos is \u2018part\u2019 of \nThailand, or to anything that smacks of condescension on the part of the Thai. In his Masters \nthesis completed at the University of Sydney, the long-serving (1998-2006) Lao ambassador \nto Thailand, Hiem Phommachanh, wrote: \u201cFor decades, the Thais acted as superiors (elder \nbrothers) over the Lao people and attempted to despise the Lao age-old cultural identity\u201d. \nThis view is not surprising when one considers that a former Thai premier, Kukrit Pramoj, is \nreputed to have once said that \u201cliving with Laos is like raising a pet gibbon\u201d (quoted in Khien \nTheeravit and Adisorn Semyaem, 2002, page 57). Thongchai Winichakul\u2019s (2005) review of \nThai scholarship on Southeast Asia notes how it has tended to be \u2018ego-centric\u2019 in orientation, \n                                                 \n2 In 2004 the Thai Ministry of Interior estimated that there were 181,614 registered migrants from Laos \nworking in Thailand, 80,981 men and 100,633 women (Maniemai Thongyou and Dusadee Ayuwat, \n2005, page 3). There are also many unregistered migrant workers. Some NGOs estimate that there are \n300,000 Lao working in Thailand (Huijsmans, 2007, page 20). \n \n 10\nviewing the country\u2019s neighbours either as dependencies or as enemies. Nor does Thongchai \nthink much has changed: \u201cLaos is still the pitiful sibling of earlier days\u2026tied to and \ndependent on Thailand\u201d (Thongchai Winichakul, 2005, page 123). A good portion of Lao \ngovernment policy is designed to \u2018protect\u2019 the Lao population from what are seen to be the \ncorrosive influences of Big Brother across the Mekong. \n \nA Thai-funded study of Lao perceptions of Thailand undertaken in 2001 revealed that 14 out \nof 39 national leaders sampled \u2013 more than one third \u2013 viewed Thailand as \u2018more a foe than a \nfriend\u2019.3 It is not just a case of cultural sensitivities linked to a prevailing sense of Thai \nsuperiority. It is also necessary to recognise that security concerns play an important role in \nmoulding Lao-Thai relations. Historically, Thailand has harboured territorial ambitions in \nLaos. During the war between the Pathet Lao and Royal Lao government, Thailand hosted US \nbases from where military aircraft were dispatched in support of the RLG\u2019s efforts; after 1975, \nrefugee camps in Thailand housed thousands of displaced Lao, many of them vehemently \nopposed to the new government in Vientiane; and there was a small but vicious border battle \nin 1987-1988 between the two countries over disputed territory in Ban Romklao-Boten, \nstraddling Thailand\u2019s Phitsanulok province and Xayabouri in Laos (Figure 1). It is this that \nexplains why all but one of the 39 Lao national leaders interviewed in the survey noted above \nstated that Thailand was a threat to Lao national security in the past and, moreover, that 30 \ncontinued to believe this to be the case (Khien Theeravit and Adisorn Semyaem, 2002, page \n81). \n \nThe sensitivities that inform Lao-Thai relations can be seen reflected in small ways, as well as \nlarge. Take, for example, how the Lao government has dealt with the thorny issue of \n\u2018poverty\u2019. Poverty \u2013 officially \u2013 did not exist in Laos until relatively recently, on first sight an \n                                                 \n3 The same study revealed that 28 out of the 39 Lao national leaders felt that \u2013 among a selection of \nnations \u2013 it was the Thai people who were most likely to look down upon the Lao. \n \n 11\nodd state of affairs in one of the world\u2019s poorest countries.4 It was only in 2001 that a \ndefinition of poverty was adopted by the government, and an officially accepted Lao term for \npoverty was embraced a year after this, in 2002.5 The official term for poverty in Laos is thuk \nnyak (suffering + difficult) (Chamberlain and Phanh Phomsombath, 2002, page 62). Thuk is \nthe Buddhist term for suffering and, as Chamberlain and Phanh Phomsombath say, is closer to \nmental than to physical suffering. Significantly, the Lao authorities decided to pair thuk with \nnyak and in so doing avoided using the most likely alternative pairing, thuk + chon. Chon, or \nyaak chon, is the popular Thai word for poverty and is closer to meaning \u2018destitute\u2019 than the \nless extreme and grinding \u2018difficult\u2019. At one level we can interpret this choice of words as an \nattempt to separate the production of poverty in Laos from the operation of the market, \nmaking poverty a \u2018natural\u2019 state of affairs connected with Buddhist metaphysics rather than \ngovernment policy. What it also does, however, is separate poverty in Laos from poverty in \nThailand, emphasising the fact that Laos is different. \n \nThe second key dualism is between the lowland Lao and the country\u2019s minorities. \nUnderstanding why this is so central to debates on Laos it is necessary to return to the \ndiscussion above about the creation of Meuang Lao \u2013 the country of Laos. In forging Laos, \nthe government in Vientiane has been presented with two particular challenges: first, there are \nmany more ethnic Lao living in Thailand than living in Laos; and second, a large proportion \n                                                 \n4 The first Lao Expenditure and Consumption Survey (LECS) was undertaken in 1992-1993 (GoL, \n1995). While there is discussion of poverty in this survey it is related to international standards and the \ninternational literature. As there was no official poverty line at the time, the survey skirts the question \nof poverty in Laos. Instead the survey talks about \u2018low standards of living\u2019.  \n \n5 Poverty is \u201cthe lack of essential needs of daily lives such as the lack of foods (possession of foods that \nare less than 2,100 calories\/head\/day), the lack of clothing, the non-possession of permanent \naccommodations, unaffordable fees of medical treatments in case of illness, unaffordable payments for \nself-education as well as that of members of the family and unavailable conditions for convenient \ncommunications\u201d (quoted in UNDP, 2001, page 129). (Note: this is an informal translation by the \nUNDP office in Vientiane.) \n \n 12\nof the population of Laos are not Lao at all, but belong to one of several score minority \ngroups. How is it possible to create a history for all the peoples of Laos, and not just the \nlowland-dwelling, Theravada Buddhism-practising, wet rice-growing, Lao? One approach \nwas to re-designate all Laos\u2019 various peoples as \u2018Lao\u2019, but of different varieties. Most official \nreports and many academic papers still refer to three broad categories of Lao, the Lao Loum, \nLao Theung and Lao Soung or, in turn, the Lowland, Midland and Highland (or Upland) Lao. \nVatthana Pholsena refers to these as \u2018seminal terms\u2019 (2002, page 180). \n \nThe Lao Loum are the dominant lowland-dwelling \u2018Lao\u2019 who make up between one half and \ntwo-thirds of the population (sources disagree). The Lao Theung map on to the \u2018Kha\u2019,6 while \nthe Lao Soung are the colonial era demarcated \u2018Meo-Yao\u2019. For Vatthana Pholsena, during the \ncourse of the colonial period and the early years of independence, a \u201ctruth had been produced \nand legitimised, naturalised through a series of discourses, which were operated, integrated \nand transmitted by\u2026colonial administration, the post-colonial state, scholars and the \npopulation\u2026\u201d (2002, page 180; and see Jamaree Chiengthong, 2003). The attraction of this \nformulation from the perspective of the Lao PDR was that all the population of Laos, no \nmatter what their ethnic origins, was \u2018Lao\u2019. It was driven by a desire to make the geographical \nspace of Laos, coincident with Lao national space. While this classification may have been \nofficially dropped in 1985 (possibly in 1981) under the orders of the General Secretary of the \nLPRP, General Kaysone Phomvihane, it lives on in reports and documents emanating not \nonly from multilateral agencies but even from government ministries (see Rigg, 2005, page \n30 [fn 15]; Vatthana Pholsena, 2006, page 158). It also has a degree of popular legitimacy and \nis invoked, on the ground, by officials and local leaders.  \n \n                                                 \n6 It has been usual to translate \u2018Kha\u2019 as meaning \u2018slave\u2019 and therefore to ascribe to it derogatory \novertones. However Chamberlain and Panh Phomsombath argue that the Tai-Kha\/civilised-uncivilised \nrelationship has been overplayed and that the term Kha has been imbued with more negative meaning \nthat it deserves (2002, page 41). \n \n 13\nNotwithstanding this effort at nation-building, the key social and economic divisions between \nthe lowland Lao and the minorities remain. The minorities, on all measures, are socially and \neconomically excluded. They are poorer, die younger, suffer higher level of morbidity and \nlower levels of nutrition, have lower levels of education, are remote from services and \ninfrastructure, and are less likely to occupy positions of authority. The ADB-sponsored \nparticipatory poverty analysis (PPA) unequivocally states: \u201c\u2026poverty in the Lao PDR is \ninextricably related to culture and ethnicity and\u2026its focus is with highlanders\u201d (ADB, 2001a, \npage 25) (Table 2). Income\/consumption inequalities are mirrored in the health and \neducational profiles of different ethnic groups. One of the largest systematic studies of \npoverty and ethnicity in Laos was undertaken by the EU in 1996. This surveyed 6,000 \nhouseholds across 342 villages in four districts in Luang Prabang province (EU, 1997) and \nidentified \u201cthe emergence of a social discriminatory process leaving behind the weaker part of \nthe rural society\u2026which appears to be Lao Theung [i.e. minority] in origin\u201d (1997, page iv). \nThe national discourse is one of equality between peoples in a multi-ethnic state; the reality, \nhowever, is one of deep-seated and continuing, possibly even deepening, inequality. \n \nThe minority\/non-minority dualism is, geographically, an upland\/lowland one, reflected in the \ncollapsing of the Lao population into three agro-ecological categories linked to where they \nlive: in the lowlands (loum), midlands (theung), or uplands (soung). It is also a dualism that \nfeeds into other significant divides: between connected and remote, between market \n(commercial) and subsistence (self-reliant), and between shifting and sedentary. In this paper, \nhowever, the argument is that it is the non-minority\/minority dualism with which we should \nbegin, because it is this dualism which is the most powerful in explaining patterns of \neconomic differentiation and social exclusion in the country. This is illustrated in a second \nand less well publicised PPA, also commissioned by the ADB, on patterns of urban poverty in \nVientiane. The study reveals that many of the very poorest (tuk thii sut) in the capital belong \nto one of the country\u2019s ethnic minorities and a dominant finding is that vulnerability is an \noutcome of social exclusion and marginalisation from key socio-economic structures (ADB, \n 14\n2001b: 17 and 36). In other words, the factors that make the ethnic minorities poor in upland \nand rural areas would seem to be reproduced in lowland areas and urban centres. \n \nThere are radically competing explanations for this all-too-clear pattern of poverty in Laos. \nThese reflect different ideological positions, which then inform policy and, in turn, have the \npotential to alter economic geographies. These links between problem identification, \nexplanation, policy-making, and economic geographies will be addressed in the next section \nof the paper. Suffice to say that the Lao state \u2013 and many of the multilateral agencies in \nVientiane \u2013 have characterised the condition of the upland peoples as a product and an \noutcome of their adherence to traditional modes of living and, more particularly, shifting \ncultivation in the uplands. Government policy is predicated on the assumption that their \nsocio-economic condition will be improved through their incorporation into the mainstream \nand through their embracing of settled agriculture. For some scholars, however, the poverty of \nthe upland people is a product of their engagement with the state and the market on \nunfavourable terms (see Rigg, 2005; Chamberlain and Panh Phomsombath, 2002; ADB, \n2001a). In other words, poverty is produced \u2013 rather than ameliorated \u2013 through \nmodernisation and state incorporation. \n \nEntry point #2: spatialities of economic activity \u2013 area based development and the GMS \n \nThe obvious spatial division and distinction \u2013 and this picks up on a long geographical \ntradition \u2013 is between upland and lowland peoples and livelihoods. While there has always \nbeen more contact and communication between upland and lowland peoples in Laos than \noften assumed, and notwithstanding the continuing efforts of the Lao government to draw \nupland areas into the mainstream, the distinction remains germane. However the spatialities \nof economic activity are being altered by two forces which have rather different, and \nsometimes contradictory or competing outcomes. These forces arise from the operation of \ngovernment policies on the one hand, and regional market integration on the other. \n 15\n The Lao government\u2019s rural development policy is area-based and focuses on concentrating \nresources and services in particular areas, bringing the people to these development centres, \nrather than vice versa (Figure 2). This strategy has been highly contentious and the generally \naccepted view today is that it has, in more than a few instances, undermined livelihoods, \nextracted upland peoples from their traditional lands, led to severe social disruption and, in \nthe process, created poverty.7 The executive summary of one report opens with the following: \n \n\u201cThere now exists a compelling and growing volume of evidence demonstrating that \ninternal resettlement and related initiatives in Laos are, in many cases, having a major and \ngenerally negative impact on the social systems, livelihoods and cultures of many \nindigenous ethnic communities and people. Tens of thousands of vulnerable indigenous \nethnic minority people have suffered and died due to impacts associated with ill-\nconceived and poorly implemented internal resettlement initiatives in Laos over the last \nten years. Many of those impacted can expect to be impoverished long into the future\u201d \n(Baird and Shoemaker, 2005, page 2). \n \nBesides the implications of these policies for human well-being, area-based development has \nalso had a profound effect on economic geographies in the uplands through concentrating \npopulations in particular sites (close to roads), barring access to traditional shifting cultivation \nfields, encouraging permanent field agriculture and, in particular, wet rice cultivation, and \ncapturing the forested spaces and their value for the state and its associates. This policy is \npartly informed by the country\u2019s nation-building creed, partly by the market-integration \nphilosophy of the major donors, and partly by deep-held normative views in Vientiane about \n                                                 \n7 The intention in this paper is not to provide a detailed dissection of the Focal Site Strategy and the \nlinked Land-Forest Allocation programme. Both, however, are area-based development strategies. For \nfurther discussion see: Rigg, 2005; Baird and Shoemaker, 2005; Baird and Shoemaker, 2007; \nDucourtieux et al, 2005; Evrard and Goudineau, 2004; Thapa, 1998; and Vandergeest, 2003. \n \n 16\nhow people should lead their lives. Regarding the second of these, the World Bank holds that \n\u201c\u2026remoteness is an important cause of rural poverty\u2026\u201d (World Bank, 1999, page 7) while \nthe UNDP also offers the view that \u201clack of access causes poverty\u201d (UNDP, 1996a, page 3). \nWith such unequivocal views, it is no surprise that the largest slice of public investment over \nthe last two decades should have been directed at infrastructure provision, and most of this to \nroad construction. \n \nFor the Lao leadership in Vientiane there is the additional perception that shifting cultivation \nis not only environmentally destructive, but also inherently primitive. Ethnic chauvinism, in \npart inherited from the colonial and pre-revolutionary independence periods and in part a \nproduct of Marxist-Leninist evolutionary views of cultural development, inform the beliefs \nand actions of politicians and policy makers. The chairman of the National Rural \nDevelopment Committee once described rural areas in Laos as \u201c\u2026areas which are isolated, \nremote and uncivilized, in which the ways of living of people are different from others, and in \nwhich there are high natural and political risks\u201d and where rural people are \u201cpoor and \nbackward, and unhappy when they lack food and medicines\u201d (UNDP, 1996b, page 14). What \nwe can see, in other words, is that a set of views held by key leaders and policy-makers in \nVientiane being translated into particular policies and these, in turn, having a profound impact \non patterns of activity across large areas of the country. It should be emphasised that \nresettlement and area-based development is not a bagatelle policy; it has led to \u201ca dramatic \ndeconstruction and restructuring of upland Lao societies over very short periods\u2026\u2018internal \nresettlement is the biggest thing happening in upland areas of Laos at the present time\u2019\u201d \n(Baird and Shoemaker, 2005, page 6). \n \nIn many respects, the Land-forest allocation programme (LFAP) is a model of aware and \nlocally-sensitive development intervention and \u2018ticks the boxes\u2019 of current best practice in \nrural development. It involves negotiation between the implementing agencies and local \npeople, takes into account local needs and views, provides villagers with collective rights to \n 17\nresources, and is highly participatory (Vandergeest, 2003, pages 49-51). These good \nintentions come unstuck because of two core sets of assumptions that inform the policy and \nwhich over-ride the participatory flannel. First about how people should be living their lives \u2013 \nnamely, as settled agriculturalists rather than as shifting cultivators; and second, about how \nland and space should be organised (see Vandergeest, 2003). With regard to the latter, the \nLFAP has led to the bureaucratisation of land and space in a context where, traditionally, \nthese were managed in a flexible manner. The programme, therefore, gathers together a \nnumber of inherently conflicting and contradictory frames. To begin with, the programme \npays homage to the international farmer-first + local knowledge + participatory development \nparadigm. Second, it implicitly reflects a set of deeply ingrained local beliefs held by many of \nthe educated elite as well as \u2018ordinary\u2019 lowlanders about upland peoples and life styles.8 And \nthird, it links into a set of technical and managerial guidelines regarding the measurement, \nclassification and categorisation of people and space. \n \nThe second force changing patterns of economic activity in Laos is linked to regional market \nintegration. This process is not confined to the lowlands, although it is in the lowlands where \nits effects are most marked. (As against government policies which have the most marked \neffects in the uplands.) Essentially, a regional human resource economy is emerging where \nthe provinces of Laos lining the Mekong are becoming tied to, and dependent upon, labouring \nopportunities in Thailand. This is creating labour shortages in some areas of Laos while also \nleading to a significant flow of income from Thailand to Laos (see Rigg, 2007). So called \n\u2018remittance landscapes\u2019 (McKay, 2003 and 2005) are being created where the multiple \ngeographies of household, home, village and field are becoming implicated into networks of \nlinks and associations tying these Lao places and lives to non-Lao places and lives. \n                                                 \n8 These are also characteristic of \u2018lowland\u2019 and elite views in Thailand and Vietnam. As Rambo et al. \nsay in the introduction to a collection of papers on highland development in Vietnam, the \u201cview of \nminority cultures as backward was manifested in presentations by many of the Vietnamese participants \n[in the conference]\u201d (1995, page xx). \n \n 18\nConnectivity, in other words does not just link people and places; it reworks those people and \nplaces. \n \nBeyond a regional human resource economy, there is an intensifying regional market in goods. \nChina to the north, Vietnam to the East, and Thailand to the west are all exerting their \ninfluence with manufactured goods streaming in to Laos, and agricultural products (and \nlabour) filtering out. While this process of market integration is less clearly and tightly linked \nto policy interventions than the resettlement and area-based development discussed above, \nthere is an evident political\/policy context. Politically, rapprochement between Laos and \nThailand has oiled trans-border links. In policy terms, the vision of forging closer associations \nbetween the countries of the Greater Mekong Sub-region (GMS) (Figure 1) for mutual benefit \nis setting in place a physical infrastructure that will create an economic geography of activity \nand interaction founded on an economic logic that is couched at the regional rather than the \nnational level: \n \n\u201cWhen, as in Cambodia and Laos, these [rural-urban] linkages are underdeveloped or do \nnot exist, farmers have no easy access to markets for produce or for inputs, and they \nneither have the incentives nor get the market signals needed for making the shift to more \nspecialized production. At the same time, rural non-farm and off-farm activities remain \nconfined to small local markets that do not allow economies of scale and specialisation or, \nif they have some access to larger markets, are at the mercy of intermediaries who take \nadvantage of their position to charge monopoly rents that do away with the possibility and \nthe incentive to invest. The consequence, in both cases, is stagnation\u201d (ADB, 2005, page \n74) \n \nThe GMS project was launched in 1992 with the encouragement and support of the ADB and \ngiven further impetus in November 2001 when the Strategic Framework for the Greater \nMekong Sub-region was adopted at the Asean Ministerial Conference (see \n 19\nhttp:\/\/www.adb.org\/GMS\/Program\/default.asp). It had become, by the turn of the Millennium, \na pivotal project of both the ADB, which helps to fund its realisation, and Asean, which \ndelivers its political rationale. At the first GMS Summit held in Phnom Penh at the end of \nNovember 2002, the leaders of the sub-region endorsed a ten-year strategic framework with \nfive strategic thrusts: \n \n\u2022 Strengthen infrastructure linkages through a multi-sectoral approach  \n\u2022 Facilitate cross-border trade and investment  \n\u2022 Enhance private sector participation in development and improve its competitiveness  \n\u2022 Develop human resources and skill competencies, and  \n\u2022 Protect the environment and promote sustainable use of the sub-region\u2019s shared \nnatural resources.  \n \n(Source: http:\/\/www.adb.org\/GMS\/devt-matrix.asp#background) \n \nCornford (2006) addresses the impacts of the GMS\u2019s East-West corridor (EWC) linking \nThailand and Vietnam through southern Laos (Figure 1). He sees the EWC as a transnational \nhighway which has, as its underpinning economic logic, the linking of northeast Thailand \nwith the port of Danang in Vietnam. Along with the road itself, the GMS requires that \nnational borders become more permeable so that people and commodities can flow freely \nbetween the countries of the sub-region. It seems highly likely that this initiative will \nprogressively make Laos part of a larger economic unit, and people\u2019s livelihoods will become \nimplicated in wider, trans-national circuits of exchange. Of course they will not become \nequally involved however, and it has been suggested that established inequalities will be \naccentuated, particularly those that relate to ethnic divisions (Cornford, 2006, page 22). Not \nonly do some scholars see the GMS initiative having negative economic effects on more \nvulnerable states and peoples, but these spill over and are reflected in negative environmental \nand social effects (see, for example, Hirsch, 2001; Oehlers, 2006). \n 20\n The key point in the context of this paper is not to argue the case for or against the GMS, but \nrather to note the way in which a regional initiative, founded on certain assumptions about the \nlikely positive outcomes of supporting regional market integration, and greased by a process \nof political rapprochement between the states of mainland Southeast Asia, is forging a new \neconomic geography in Laos. This is linked to a belief, to begin with, in the power of the \nmarket; second, in the notion that there are complementarities to be exploited between the \nGMS states; and third, in the central role of physical integration (or connectivity) in forging \nmore productive spaces and partnerships. \n \nEntry point #3: Village economic geographies and Vientiane economic geographies \n \nThe third and final entry point and binary is between what is termed here \u2018Village economic \ngeographies\u2019 and \u2018Vientiane economic geographies\u2019. With regard to this third area of debate, I \nam guided by Tania Li\u2019s work on policy formation in Indonesia and her desire to uncover not \nwhat policy is, but what policy does. She asks the question: \u2018what do development \ninterventions accomplish?\u2019 (Li, 1999). Following Li, in this section I wish to foreground the \ndisjuncture between economic geographies as seen and constructed in Vientiane and by elites \nat the centres of decision-making, and economic geographies as experienced and re-structured \nby ordinary people, on the ground. \n  \nThe role and effects of re-settlement policy in the uplands of Laos have already been \ndiscussed. While there are strong reasons to indicate that this broad policy has, in many \ninstances, been inimical to the interests of upland peoples, there is some evidence of a process \nof \u2018re-territorialisation from below\u2019. People work with, around and below the policies that the \nstate puts in place. Villagers, even in a one party state such as Laos, find ways to resist and \nsubvert these policies. Viewed from the village, therefore, policy effects are \u2013 as Li found in \nthe case of Indonesia \u2013 filtered through and shrouded by local political cultures. In the context \n 21\nof my own work fieldwork in northern Laos and reflecting on the effects of government \npolicies towards the upland minorities, I wrote: \n \n\u201c\u2026minorities become implicitly re-drawn as \u2018victims\u2019 of state policies and are left largely \ndevoid of agency, autonomy or power. The reality is rather different. Minorities often \nleave their homes, abandon their lands, and rebuild their lives voluntarily \u2013 if not always \nwillingly. Purpose is allayed with energy, direction with initiative, and intent with \nresolution. In this way there occurs a process of reterritorialisation from below, an \nunscripted and energizing transition that takes the resettled and displaced and transforms \nthem, once more, into villagers, albeit \u2018new\u2019 villagers\u201d (Rigg, 2005, pages 110-111) \n \nWe can, therefore, read the script of development from two \u2013 in fact more than two \u2013 vantage \npoints. The script as it might be read from Vientiane sets out an economic logic and \njustification based on a set of assumptions about the direction that development should take \nand the best means to alleviate poverty and improve standards of living in rural areas. This \ncentre-script is, in turn, influenced by forces and debates beyond Laos \u2013 in the offices of the \nADB and the World Bank, and in discussions held between ministers at Asean gatherings, for \ninstance. The script read from the village context reveals what happens when these policies \nrub up against the people they are ostensibly designed to \u2018help\u2019. One particular aspect of this \nconcerns the emergence of Lao village transnationalisms.  \n \nVillage transnationalisms \n \nA process of village transnationalisation is underway in Laos driven by two forces. First of all, \nby the migration of large numbers of (mostly) young Lao to Thailand, mainly for work (see \nRigg, 2007). These young women and men have their outlooks transformed in the process, \nand quite remote and poor rural communities in Laos become linked in a cultural and \naspirational sense with Thailand, as well as economically through the remittance of relatively \n 22\nlarge amounts of money. Village transnationalism is also being propelled, and second, by the \ninfiltration of the Thai media into the homes and lives of ordinary Lao, displacing Lao media \nand instilling a Bangkok-centred world view. The villages of Laos, or at least those within \naround 50 kilometres of the border with Thailand, often know more about what is going on in \ntheir neighbour than they do about events in their own country. It has been suggested that in \nareas that can receive Thai transmission signals, 80 per cent consume Thai radio and \ntelevision (Khien Theeravit and Adisorn Semyaem, 2002, page 17). Those living further away \ncan also do so, using satellite dishes. \n \nIn the process, villages in Laos are becoming oriented towards Thailand in social and \neconomic terms. Pattana Kitiarsa (2006) has explored village transnationalism in the context \nof Thai-Isan migrants to Singapore, where migrants reproduce village life styles and habits in \nthe city state \u2013 which Pattana Kitiarsa terms \u2018transnationalism from below\u2019 (page 32).9 \nMigrants are excluded from mainstream Singapore society and, partly in defensive response, \nmaintain an identity in mind and practice which is resolutely Thai. In the context of the \ndiscussion here, the notion of village transnationalism focuses on the way that labour \nmigration to Thailand and contact between Lao and Thai lives and lifestyles infiltrates Lao \nvillage spaces. There are clear differences between Lao villagers migrating to Thailand for \nwork, and Thai-Isan villagers migrating to Singapore, not least the cultural distance \nseparating sending and receiving countries and populations. Nonetheless, the power of such \nlinks to explain changing economic geographies at home and in places of work is significant. \nIt is also worth noting that the migration of villagers from the Northeast of Thailand to \nSingapore and elsewhere creates the labour vacuum that Lao migrants have partially filled. \n \nThe intensifying contact \u2013 virtual and actual \u2013 between ordinary Lao and Thailand is viewed \nwith some concern in Vientiane. The effects of the Thai media are seen to be corrosive of Lao \n                                                 \n9 Thai-Isan migrants are from the Northeastern region of Thailand, and ethnically Lao. \n \n 23\nculture, \u2018poisonous\u2019 to Lao society, \u2018indoctrinating\u2019, and promoting \u2018informational \nimperialism\u2019 (Khien Theeravit and Adisorn Semyaem, 2002). In February 2007 the Lao \ngovernment requested that a Thai soap opera not be transmitted because, a Lao foreign \nministry spokesman said, it was \u2018against Lao culture\u2019 as it depicted a love affair between a \nLao woman, born out of wedlock, and a Thai man: \u201cIt\u2019s against Lao culture to have a child \nwithout marriage\u2026well, Thais might be okay with it but not for Laos\u201d (Nation, 2007; see also \nJory, 2003). To the Lao authorities, the Lao lead was a \u2018bastard child\u2019. This is only the latest \nof a series of protests against Thai media imperialism and its presumed negative effects on \nLao culture. Against the edifice of Thai commercial television and radio, the central plank in \nthe Lao government\u2019s reform programme seems a trifling thing. In our study of nine rural \nvillages in Luang Prabang and Vientiane provinces undertaken in 2001 and 2002, we found a \nvery low level of awareness of the New Economic Mechanism (Rigg, 2005). We suspect that \nthere was, by comparison, a high level of awareness of political scandals and popular gossip \nin Bangkok. \n \nReflecting on Lao economic geographies: village and trans-national governmentalities \n \nEven in the hills and among the ethnic minorities of Laos, the market has been brought to \nbear. The world may not have been worn \u2018flat\u2019 in Thomas Friedman\u2019s (2005) terms, but it has \nat least been inscribed onto the same page. The point, therefore, is not that some peoples and \nplaces lie outside the ambit of \u2018normal\u2019 explanation, but that their incorporation has been \nunequal. For Laos, this is most profound when it comes to understanding the effects of change \non the minorities. \n \nTo understand and interpret the changes underway in Laos, we need to be intellectually \nflexible. This flexibility lies, to begin with, in where we look, both spatially and in \ndisciplinary terms. It has been suggested that the key spaces of interaction in Laos encompass \nan upland\/lowland + minority\/non-minority interface, a Laos\/Thailand interface, and a \n 24\nLaos\/GMS interface. These offer the most fruitful routes into an understanding of the \ncountry\u2019s evolving economic geographies. But to understand how and why these spaces of \ninteraction function as they do, it is necessary to look beyond the economic to a series of \nhyphenated economies: the cultural-economy, the social-economy, the political-economy, the \nhistorical-economy, and the institutional-economy (Table 3).  \n \nAt the same time, we need to be aware of how we tend to examine Laos\u2019 economic \ngeographies. In the main, perspectives are shaped, framed and informed using a Vientiane-\ncentric viewpoint. This, in turn, is influenced by two sets of forces, one emanating from a \nglobal debate regarding economic reform and transition, and the other arising from regional \nperspectives linked to embedded historiographies and the evolution of the GMS. It has been \nargued that policies in Laos need to be seen not just as technocratic and managerialist efforts \ninformed by a global discourse of development and administration, but equally as products of \nlocal and regional \u2018rationalities\u2019. Thus, in area-based development initiatives we see reflected \nboth a set of international agendas linked to issues of access and market integration, and \ndomestic concerns and beliefs associated with the proper place of people and activities in Lao \nspace. In turn, the domestic debate concerning Laos\u2019 place in the GMS is informed both by \nthe attitudes of the funding agencies (particularly the ADB) and by a historically and \nculturally deep historiography linked with Lao-Thai relations. \n \nReturning to the theme of \u2018trans-national governmentality\u2019 introduced towards the beginning \nof the paper, Laos certainly seems to fit the explanatory template. The country may not offer a \nparticularly rich space for the operation of NGOs (there are no local NGOs), the World Bank, \nADB, IMF, FAO and other trans-national agencies do play a very significant role indeed. \nThus the economic geographies \u2013 the spatialities of economic activity from subsistence \nshifting cultivation through to patterns of migration \u2013 that can be discerned across Laos are \npartially linked to the ideologies, development assumptions and the practical operation of \nsuch organisations, often in alliance\/conjunction with the Lao state. \n 25\n There is, to be sure, considerable mileage to be gained from thinking of Lao economic \ngeographies as outcomes of national and trans-national governmentalities. But this paper has \nalso argued that a village-centric perspective \u2013 remembering that the great bulk of the \npopulation of Laos still live in villages \u2013 provides an alternative vision that cuts across and \ndisturbs these debates and vision. Processes of change in villages in Laos do not necessarily \ncontradict the wider national image of marketisation and reform but rather demonstrate how \ngeographically contingent this picture is. While \u2018village governmentalities\u2019 are not trans-\nlocally powerful in the  way that state or trans-national organisations and agencies may be, \nthey are locally powerfully. So much so, that village-based structures and personalities may \nbe ultimately determining. \n \nJust, for the moment, the danger of seeing the bigger picture is that we are then tempted to see \nAsian economic geographies as generic. There are, to be sure, many similarities in the \ndiscussion above with the experiences of other countries. For example, in terms of \nupland\/lowland divisions, minority\/non-minority relations, and sedentary\/shifting lifestyles. \nBut these outcomes, though similar in appearance are different both in essence and in origin, \nfor they are linked to a series of spatial associations, scalar disjunctures, historical \ncontingencies, and cultural incongruities which are place-based and country or region specific. \nIt is for this reason that we need to take the time and care to excavate beneath the economic \ngeographies that appear before us.  \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nI would like to thank Roy Huijsmans and Henry Yeung for their valuable comments on an \nearlier draft of this paper.
