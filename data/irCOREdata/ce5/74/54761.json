Probably due \nto its crucial role in social communication, it is argued that face perception may \ninvolve different cognitive processes compared with non-face object or scene \nperception. In this study, we investigated whether and how face and natural scene \nimages can influence the patterns of visuomotor activity. We recorded monkeys\u2019 \nsaccadic eye movements as they freely viewed monkey face and natural scene images. \nThe face and natural scene images attracted similar number of fixations, but viewing \nof faces was accompanied by longer fixations compared with natural scenes. These \nlonger fixations were dependent on the context of facial features. The duration of \nfixations directed at facial contours decreased when the face images were scrambled, \nand increased at the later stage of normal face viewing. The results suggest that face \nand natural scene images can generate different patterns of visuomotor activity. The \nextra fixation duration on faces may be correlated with the detailed analysis of facial \nfeatures. \n  \nKeywords: Eye movement \u2013 Face image \u2013 Natural scene \u2013 Monkey  \n 2\n  \nIntroduction \nVisual exploration of a complex scene involves a series of saccades and \nfixations, which can shift our attention between specific objects or informative \nfeatures within the scene and make detailed analysis and identification of the scene \n(Biederman 1987; Henderson and Hollingworth 1999). There are two important \naspects of eye movements while studying gaze control during the scene perception, \nwhere fixations tend to be directed (fixation position) and how long they typically \nremain there (fixation duration) (Henderson 2003). Although human saccadic eye \nmovements show a variety of stereotypic patterns while inspecting visual scenes \n(Yarbus 1967), the frequency and size of saccades can be modulated by the cognitive \ndemand and characteristics of the observed scene (Salthouse et al. 1981; Jacobs 1986; \nPollatsek et al. 1986; Epelboim et al. 1995; Hooge and Erkelens 1998; Andrews and \nCoppola 1999). For example, longer fixations are normally associated with difficult \nwords in reading task (Pollatsek et al. 1986) and decreased discriminability of target \nin visual search task (Jacobs 1986; Hooge and Erkelens 1998); and natural scenes \ngenerate shorter fixations and larger saccades compared with simple pattern images in \nfree viewing task (Andrews and Coppola 1999).  \nAs faces can provide visual information about an individual\u2019s gender, age and \nfamiliarity, and their expressions offer significant cues to intention and mental state \n(Bruce and Young 1998; Emery 2000), the ability to recognize these cues and to \nrespond accordingly plays an important role in the social life of higher primates \n(Andrew 1963; Anderson 1998). It is argued that face perception is involved in a \nunique cognitive process compared with non-face object or scene perception. For \nexample, psychophysical studies have observed detrimental recognition performance \nfor inverted faces rather than non-face objects or scenes (face inversion effect) (e.g. \n 3\n  \nYin, 1969; Valentine 1988; Rossion and Gauthier 2002), a visual preference for face-\nlike stimuli in human neonates (Johnson and Morton 1991; see also Turati et al. \n2002), and selective impairments of face and object recognition in neurological \npatients (prosopagnosia and visual agnosia) (e.g. Sergent and Signoret 1992; Farah \n1996; Moscovitch et al. 1997). Recordings of human event-related potentials showed \na different topography to face (including human and animal faces) and non-face \nobject or scene stimuli in the N170 time window (e.g. Bentin et al. 1996; Itier and \nTaylor 2004; Rousselet et al. 2004). Elecrtophysiology and brain imaging studies \nfurther suggested a distinct neuroanatomical region in cerebral cortex associated with \nthe cortical processing of faces (face-selective neurons in monkey inferotemporal \ncortex, fusiform face area in human cortex) (e.g. Sergent et al. 1992; McCarthy et al. \n1997; Tanaka 1997; Tsao et al. 2003). However, this view is recently challenged by \nsome brain imaging studies suggesting that faces are processed by a domain-general \nsystem for fine-grained, exemplar-level object perception but probably at different \nlevel of recognition or different degree of perceptual expertise (Gauthier et al. 1999, \n2000; Tarr and Cheng 2003). \nIt is not clear, however, whether inspection of face and non-face scenes, which \nhave different image characteristics and may involve different cognitive processes \n(i.e. different cortical processes, different level of recognition or different degree of \nperceptual expertise), can influence the patterns of visuomotor activity. To examine \nthis issue, we compared monkeys\u2019 saccadic eye movements when they freely viewed \nface and natural scene images. Familiar scenes sampled from monkeys\u2019 daily \nenvironment were also used to examine potential influence of the familiarity of \nnatural scene images. This exploratory project is not only important to increase our \nunderstanding of the relation between the category of real world stimuli and the \n 4\n  \norganisation of goal-directed eye movements in non-human primates, but also for \ncomparison with findings from humans, as the behaviour and neurophysiology of \nmonkeys comprises the most significant model for the advancement of research into \nhuman brain function. We observed that the face images tended to generate longer \nfixations compared with the natural scene images, and these longer fixations were \nassociated with the context of facial features. \n \nMethods \nSubjects \nThree male adult rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta, 4.5-6.0 kg) were trained \nto fixate a small fixation point (FP) for several seconds in a dimming fixation \ndetection task. To make eye movement recordings, a scleral eye coil and head \nrestraint were implanted under aseptic conditions (Guo and Benson 1998). All \nprocedures complied with the \u201cPrinciples of laboratory animal care\u201d (NIH publication \nno. 86-23, revised 1985) and UK Home Office regulations.  \nStimuli and apparatus \nDigitized gray scale images were presented through a VSG 2\/3 graphics \nsystem (Cambridge Research Systems) and displayed on a high frequency non-\ninterlaced gamma-corrected color monitor (6.0 cd\/m2 background luminance, 110 Hz \nframe rate, Sony GDM-F500T9) with the resolution of 1024 \u00d7 768 pixels. At a \nviewing distance of 57cm the monitor subtended a visual angle of 40 \u00d7 30\u00b0.   \nFour different classes of images were used as stimuli (see examples in Fig. 1A \nand 2A): (1) 20 neutral monkey (Macaca mulatta) face images, (2) 20 natural scene \nimages (including buildings, landscape, trees and plants etc.), (3) 15 familiar natural \nscene images which were taken from monkeys\u2019 daily environment, (4) 10 scrambled \n 5\n  \nmonkey face images. The scrambled images were generated by dividing each \ncomplete face image into a 4 \u00d7 4 matrix and randomly rearranging the parts (Guo et \nal. 2003). By doing so, most of the local facial features (eyes, nose and mouth) were \nkept intact and recognizable, but the global structure of the face was disrupted. All \nimages were in sharp focus at all depths of field, and were gamma-corrected and \ndisplayed once in a random order at the center of the screen with a resolution of 512 \u00d7 \n512 pixels (20 \u00d7 20\u00b0). \nDuring the experiments the monkey sat in a primate chair with head \nrestrained, and viewed the display binocularly. To calibrate eye movement signals, a \nsmall red FP (0.2\u00b0 diameter, 7.8 cd\/m2 luminance) was displayed randomly at one of \ntwenty-five positions (5 \u00d7 5 matrix) across the monitor. The distance between \nadjacent FP positions was 5\u00b0. The monkey was trained to follow the FP and maintain \nfixation for 1 s. After the calibration procedure, the trial was started with a FP \ndisplayed on the center of monitor. If the monkey maintained fixation for 500 ms, the \nFP disappeared and an image was presented for 20 s. During the presentation, the \nmonkeys passively viewed the images. No reinforcement was given during this \nprocedure, neither were the animals trained on any other task with these stimuli, \nwhich could have potentially affected the structure of their behavior. It was \nconsidered that with their lack of training, and in the absence of instrumental \nresponding, their behavior should be as natural as possible.  \nEye movement recordings and analysis \n Horizontal and vertical eye positions were measured using an 18-inch cubic \nscleral search coil assembly with 6 min arc sensitivity (CNC Engineering). Eye \nmovement signals were amplified and sampled at 500 Hz through CED1401 plus \ndigital interface (Cambridge Electronic Design). The software developed in Matlab \n 6\n  \ncomputed horizontal and vertical eye displacement signals as a function of time to \ndetermine eye velocity and position. Fixation locations and durations were then \nextracted from the raw eye tracking data using velocity (less than 0.2\u00b0 eye \ndisplacement at a velocity of less than 20\u00b0\/s) and duration (greater than 50 ms) criteria \n(Guo et al. 2003).  \n As the main experimental design comprised three levels of image category \n(faces vs natural scenes vs familiar scenes), one-way repeated analysis of variance \n(ANOVA) was carried out after pooling the data from three monkeys. Appropriate \npost hoc testing of differences between levels of image category (Tukey\u2019s least \nsignificant procedure) was also carried out following detection of significant overall \nvariable ratios.  \n \nResults \nThe gray scale face and natural scene images appeared equally salient to the \nmonkeys. No difference was observed in the number of fixations across the image \ncategories (ANOVA, F(2,162)=0.5, p=0.61; Fig. 1B). During the entire 20-second \npresentation, three monkeys made 24.73 \u00b1 1.51 (Mean \u00b1 SEM), 24.82 \u00b1 1.69 and \n22.82 \u00b1 1.58 fixations across the face, familiar scene and natural scene images.  \nThe fixation durations were influenced by the image categories. Although \nfrequency distribution analysis showed that the monkeys made frequent short \nfixations (peak around 200 ms) while viewing the images (Guo et al. 2003), the faces \ntended to generate longer fixations (ANOVA, F(2,3975)=35.7, p=4.29E-16; post-hoc \ntest, face vs familiar scene: p=7.91E-13, face vs natural scene: p=1.71E-11; Fig. 1C). \nIn contrast, the familiar scenes and natural scenes had indistinguishable fixation \ndurations (post-hoc test, p=0.66). The mean fixation durations were 317 \u00b1 8 (Mean \u00b1 \n 7\n  \nSEM), 249 \u00b1 5 and 253 \u00b1 5 ms for face, familiar scene and natural scene images. The \nconclusion also holds for the median fixation durations which are less sensitive for the \nskewed distributions of fixation durations (e.g. Fig. 3B in Guo et al., 2003). The \nmedian fixation durations were 222, 205 and 200 ms for face, familiar scene and \nnatural scene images. \nInspection of the natural scene is accompanied by a series of fixations directed \ntowards important and informative scene regions. Recent studies observed higher \nlocal luminance contrast and lower local two-point correlation for fixated scene \npatches than un-fixated patches (Reinagel and Zador 1999; Krieger et al. 2000; \nParkhurst and Niebur 2003), suggesting that local image statistics, such as luminance \ncontrast, is a major contributor to the saliency map for overt attention (Parkhurst et al. \n2002). To examine whether the differences in fixation durations for the three classes \nof images were due to the differences in the physical properties and statistics of those \nfixated image regions, we calculated local luminance contrasts around individual \nfixations in different images. The local contrast is a measure of variability of the \nintensity within an image patch, and is defined as the standard deviation of the \nluminance within a square image divided by the mean intensity of the whole image \n(Reinagel and Zador 1999; Einh\u00e4user and K\u00f6nig 2003). The size of the square region \nwas chosen to be 2\u00b0 \u00d7 2\u00b0 (\u00b11\u00b0 around the fixation) which roughly covers the spatial \nscale of the size of the fovea. While the average fixation duration in the face images \nwas longer than that in the familiar scenes (Fig. 1C), the average local contrast around \nthe fixations in the face images (0.2568 \u00b1 0.0034) was not significantly different from \nthat in the familiar scenes (0.2539 \u00b1 0.0038; t-test, p>0.05; Fig. 2). However, the \naverage local contrast around the fixations in the natural scene images (0.3512 \u00b1 \n0.0061) was higher than that in the face and familiar scene images (ANOVA, \n 8\n  \nF(2,3975)=157.11, P=2.63E-66). This is due to the physical properties of the natural \nscene images, as the average local contrast from random samples in the natural scenes \n(25 samples per image) was also proportionally higher than that in the face and \nfamiliar scene images (ANOVA, F(2,1372)=113.02, p=3.67E-46; Fig. 2). \nFor individual fixations sampled while viewing face, familiar scene and \nnatural scene images, we further plotted its duration against its local contrast (Fig. 3). \nIn agreement with previous study of human subjects (Einh\u00e4user and K\u00f6nig 2003), \nover all images and all subjects, we found no correlation between local contrast and \nfixation duration (r = 0.00005, 0.0007 and 0.0002 for face, familiar scene and natural \nscene images). This holds also true for the local contrasts calculated using smaller (1\u00b0 \n\u00d7 1\u00b0) or larger (3\u00b0 \u00d7 3\u00b0) spatial scale around the fixations (r<0.001 for all images). \nThis analysis shows that the local luminance contrast was unlikely related to the \ndifferences in the fixation durations while viewing face, familiar scene and natural \nscene images.  \nAs the measurement of local contrast is insensitive to the spatial organization \nof intensities within an image patch, we also employed two-point correlation function, \nwhich calculates the correlation between the point at the centre of each fixation and a \npoint within local neighbourhood of the fixation (\u00b11\u00b0 around the fixation in this \nstudy), to quantify the correlation in intensity between pairs of pixels in the image \npatch (Reinagel and Zador 1999). The mean and covariance of correlation matrices \nover the fixations within individual face, familiar scene and natural scene images \nwere calculated and further averaged over each class of the images and subjects \n(Cootes and Taylor 1992; Cootes et al. 1992). Figure 4 shows the mean of correlations \nfor each class of images. In general, correlation is a function of distance between \n 9\n  \nimage points (pixels). The local image structures around the fixations in the natural \nscene images seemed to be less correlated than that in the face images. \nTo further quantify the variations of correlations for each class of images, \neigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix were computed to analyse \nprinciple components of our correlation data over each class (Kreyszig 1999). The \nMahalanobis (weighted) distance between the mean of each class and the mean of \nother classes were finally calculated to determine whether different classes were \noverlapped with each other or separated from each other (Cootes and Taylor 1992; \nCootes et al. 1992). Figure 5 shows the distribution of our data for these three classes \nof images by considering first two important modes (components) of variations. The \ndistribution function was assumed as a multidimensional Gaussian function whose \nvariances correspond to the eigenvalues of the covariance of the correlation data. \nThese Gaussian functions were considered in a feature space obtained by applying \nHotelling transform to our data (Cootes and Taylor 1992; Cootes et al. 1992; Kreyszig \n1999). This analysis shows a clear difference in spatial correlations between fixations \nsampled from the face and natural scene images. The local image structures are more \nspatially correlated in the face images. However, this difference in local spatial \ncorrelations between the face and natural scene images is unlikely related to the \ndifference in fixation durations while viewing the face and natural scene images. \nCompared with the face images, the correlations between nearby pixels were weak in \nthe natural scene images, indicating a rich structure on small spatial scale in the \nnatural scene images. Therefore the natural scene images are statistically less \nredundant (Field 1987; Ruderman and Bialek 1994; Simoncelli and Olshausen 2001), \nand consequently should attract longer fixation durations for the purpose of foveal \nanalysis rather than shorter fixation durations as we observed in the recording. \n 10\n  \nHowever, the relationship between fixation duration and local spatial structure of the \nstimulus may well be task dependent. For example, the natural scene image could \nattract longer fixation durations in a search task compared with the free viewing task \nwe employed in this experiment. Nevertheless, our observation suggests that the \nfixation duration is dependent upon not only simple local properties like contrast and \nspatial correlation, but also some complex features like informativeness. \nWhile viewing the faces, the monkeys\u2019 fixation was mainly directed to the \nprincipal local facial features, even with the scrambled faces (see examples in Fig. 1A \nand 6A) (Guo et al. 2003). To investigate whether the longer fixations on facial \nfeatures are dependent upon their spatial configurations, we compared the durations of \nfixations on eyes, nose, mouth and facial contours (including hairlines) within normal \nand scrambled face images (Fig. 6A). While the fixations on eyes, nose and mouth \nhad the same durations between normal and scrambled faces (paired t-test, p>0.05), \nthe mean duration of fixations on facial contours of normal faces (302 \u00b1 12 ms) was \nlonger than that of scrambled faces (282 \u00b1 20 ms) (paired t-test, p=0.03). \nWe further compared the durations of each of the first seven fixations on the \neyes and facial contours within normal face images (this number was chosen as it \nrepresented the maximum number of fixations within the region for some images, Fig. \n6B). While the fixation durations on the eyes were the same with changing fixation \nsequence (ANOVA, F(6,268)=0.85, p=0.53), the duration of fixations on the facial \ncontours increased gradually at the later stage of fixation (ANOVA, F(6,214)=3.75, \np=0.001). There was no significant change of the fixation durations on the same \nregions within scrambled faces with increasing fixation sequence (ANOVA, eyes: \nF(6,98)=1.25, p=0.29; facial contours: F(6,115)=0.67, p=0.68). \n \n 11\n  \nDiscussion \n In the present study, we compared the patterns of saccadic eye movements \nwhile monkeys freely viewed face and natural scene images (including familiar and \nnovel natural scenes). The face and natural scene images appeared equally salient to \nthe monkeys. They attracted similar number of fixations during the image \npresentation. However, viewing of the faces was accompanied by longer fixations \ncompared with the natural scenes. This difference in fixation durations across \ndifferent classes of images is unlikely to be related to the differences in local physical \nproperties and statistics of these images which was demonstrated by the analysis of \nlocal luminance contrast (standard deviation of intensity in a fixation patch, Fig. 2, 3) \nand local two-point correlation function (intensity of the fixated point and nearby \npoints, Fig. 4, 5) across the different classes of images. Comparison between familiar \nand novel natural scenes showed that these two classes of natural images attracted \nsimilar amount of fixation durations (Fig. 1). Because our familiar scenes were \n\u2018artificial\u2019 man-made scenes sampled from monkeys\u2019 daily environment, and novel \nnatural scenes included both \u2018artificial\u2019 scenes (i.e. buildings) and \u2018natural\u2019 scenes \n(i.e. plants), it is difficult to exclude the potential influence of the \u2018naturalness\u2019 of \nscenes on fixation duration without further detailed examination with large sample \nsize. However, as our analysis also revealed that the fixation durations sampled from \nnovel \u2018natural\u2019 scenes (253 \u00b1 7 ms) were not significantly different from those \nsampled from novel \u2018artificial\u2019 scenes (248 \u00b1 11 ms) (t-test, p=0.61), it is unlikely that \nthe potential interaction between familiarity and \u2018naturalness\u2019 of the tested scenes \ncould fully account for our observation of difference in fixation durations between \nface and natural scene images.  \n 12\n  \nDetailed examination of facial configurations further revealed that the longer \nfixations on facial contours appeared to be dependent upon the arrangement of these \ncontours into a coherent and recognizable object, namely a face. The duration of the \nfixations on the same facial contours in the scrambled face images were significantly \nshorter (Fig. 6). These results suggest that face and natural scene images may generate \ndifferent patterns of visuomotor activity. The extra fixation duration on faces may be \ncorrelated with the detailed analysis of facial features. \nOculomotor strategies are closely linked with the cognitive demand (Epelboim \net al. 1995), and the fixation duration has been correlated with the amount of \ninformation being processed during foveal analysis (Moffit 1980). Longer fixations \nare usually associated with extra cognitive demand and\/or display complexity \n(Salthouse et al. 1981; Jacobs 1986; Hooge and Erkelens 1998). For example, \nindividual fixation durations are longer during scene memorization than search \n(Henderson et al. 1999), or when the image at fixation is reduced by contrast or \npartially obscured by a noise mask (van Diepen 1995). \nOne of the major differences between face and natural scene images is that \nfaces have inherent social significance. They are behaviorally relevant visual stimuli \nfor primates, which provide essential information about an individual\u2019s gender, age, \nfamiliarity, intention and mental state (e.g. Bruce and Young 1998; Emery 2000). \nWhen viewing a complex scene containing faces, the highest portion of human \nfixations is directed to the faces (Yarbus 1967). The local facial features, such as eyes, \nare not just simple geometric patterns or objects. They also contain significant social \ncommunicative signals. Like human, monkeys are also heavily reliant on facial \nsignals for social communication. Based on facial cues alone, they are readily able to \nrespond appropriately to the expressions of other individuals (Mendelson et al. 1982), \n 13\n  \nto recognize and discriminate the faces of familiar and unfamiliar individuals \n(Rosenfeld and van Hoesen 1979; Parr et al. 2000). Their visual system also appears \nto be tuned to the informative facial features (Guo et al. 2003). They showed a \npreferential interest, high density of fixations and longer fixation durations, to the \nmajor local facial features while viewing faces. As local image complexity around the \nfixations is unlikely account for the differences in fixation durations between the face \nand natural scene images (Fig. 2, 3, 4, 5), the extra duration of fixations for the faces \nmay be correlated with the extra cognitive demand (i.e. \u201cconfigural process\u201d) which \ninvolves detailed analysis of local facial features and perceiving relations among the \nfacial features, and therefore maybe important for acquisition and processing of facial \ncues, such as identity, expression and gaze direction (Maurer et al. 2002). As we only \ntested neural face images in a free viewing task in this experiment, in the future study \nit will be interesting to systematically manipulate social relevance over controlled sets \nof face images and\/or cognitive demand, and to investigate the relations among social \nperception, cognitive demand and patterns of saccadic eye movements.  \nInterestingly, the disruption of facial configuration (i.e. scrambled faces) \nseems only affect the number of fixations (Guo et al. 2003) rather than the duration of \nfixations on the faces (Fig. 6). The fixations on major local facial features, such as \neyes, nose and mouth, had the same durations between normal and scrambled faces, \nonly fixations on facial contours slightly decreased for scrambled faces. \nFacial cues, such as identity, gender and attractiveness, are sensitive to the \nmanipulation of metric properties of a face (Burton et al. 1993; Perrett et al. 1994; \nFellous 1997). Humans can detect variations in facial metric information as small as \none minute of visual angle, a value close to the limits of acuity (Haig 1984). Previous \nstudies suggest that this facial metric information is explicitly encoded in the brain \n 14\n  \nand may be used for face perception and discrimination (Yamane et al. 1988; Young \nand Yamane 1992). Indeed, the responses of face-selective neurons in anterior \ninferotemporal cortex of macaques are correlated with dimensions relating the hairline \nto other facial points, especially the eyes, in face discrimination tasks (Young and \nYamane 1992). In our study, the observed monkeys\u2019 fixations on facial contours may \nbe correlated with the analysis of the properties of facial dimensions, and this process \nmay require extra fixation time. While in the scrambled faces, due to the lack of \ninformation about the facial dimensions, the fixations to these features may just \nprovide less sophisticated local information (i.e. local contrast and local contour). \n \nReferences \nAnderson JR (1998) Social stimuli and social rewards in primate learning and \ncognition.
