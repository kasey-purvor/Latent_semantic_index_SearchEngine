Introduction \nThe island of Madagascar comprises a collage of Precambrian basement terranes, \noverlain by Phanerozoic sedimentary basins along the west coast. The Precambrian \nterranes were juxtaposed during the Neoproterozoic to Cambrian (Pan-African) East \nAfrican and Malagasy orogenies (Collins and Pisarevsky, 2005). The East African \nOrogen (EAO; Fig. 1) extends from Egypt in the north to Antarctica in the south (Stern, \n1994; Meert, 2003; Jacobs and Thomas, 2004) and represents the collision zone between \nNeoproterozoic India, the Congo-Tanzania-Bangweulu block, and the Saharan \nmetacraton (Meert, 2003; Collins and Pisarevsky, 2005; Collins, 2006). Madagascar lies \nin the heart of the EAO, and its basement rocks have been studied from a number of \nviewpoints including metamorphic histories (e.g. Buchwaldt et al., 2003; J\u00f6ns et al., \n2006); structural geology (Collins et al., 2003a, b; Tucker et al., 2007; Thomas et al., \n2009) and magmatic processes (N\u00e9d\u00e9lec et al., 1995; Paquette and N\u00e9d\u00e9lec, 1998; Meert \net al., 2001). In this paper we focus on the post-collisional intrusions of the Maevarano \nSuite of northern Madagascar, in order to understand the lithospheric processes related to \nthe latter stages of this major orogenic event. Our work is the result of a major World \nBank sponsored project, which involved re-mapping and sampling the basement rocks of \nnorthern Madagascar, undertaken by a consortium of the British Geological Survey \n(BGS), the United States Geological Survey (USGS), and GLW Conseil (GLW). The \nresults were presented in the form of geological maps of various scales and an \nunpublished explanation (BGS-USGS-GLW, 2008). \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n66 \n67 \n68 \n69 \n70 \n71 \n72 \n73 \n74 \n75 \n76 \n77 \n78 \n79 \n80 \n81 \n82 \n83 \n84 \n85 \n86 \n87 \n88 \nVoluminous post-collisional granitoids are a major feature of the EAO (Black and \nLi\u00e9geois, 1993; K\u00fcster and Harms, 1998; Meert, 2003; Jacobs et al., 2008). They are \ntypically alkaline and metaluminous in composition, and can be broadly characterised as \nA-type granitoids under the classification of Whalen et al. (1987). In the southern part of \nthe EAO, in East Antarctica and Mozambique, peak metamorphism associated with \ncollision-induced crustal thickening occurred at ca. 555 Ma (Bingen et al., 2009) and \npost-collisional magmas were emplaced between ca. 530 and 485 Ma, with a pulse of \nvoluminous granitoid and charnockite magmatism at 510 \u2013 500 Ma (Jacobs et al., 2008). \nIn central Madagascar, alkaline granite sheets (termed \u2018stratoid granites\u2019) have been dated \nat ca. 630 Ma (N\u00e9d\u00e9lec et al., 1995; Paquette and N\u00e9d\u00e9lec, 1998) and were considered to \nbe post-collisional, following a high-grade metamorphic episode at ca. 650 Ma (Meert et \nal., 2003). In northern and central Madagascar, prograde metamorphism occurred \nbetween 570 and 520 Ma (J\u00f6ns et al., 2006; Tucker et al., 2007), and a number of post-\ncollisional plutons were emplaced during the period 550 \u2013 520 Ma (Tucker et al., 1999; \nKr\u00f6ner et al., 1999, 2000; Meert et al., 2001; Buchwaldt et al., 2003). In the northern part \nof the EAO, many post-collisional potassic granitoids were emplaced, following crustal \nthickening, between 630 and 470 Ma (K\u00fcster and Harms, 1998 (Sudan, Ethiopia and \nSomalia); Be\u2019eri-Shlevin et al, 2009a (Israel and Egypt)). However, it seems that \ngranitoids of this type are less abundant in the central EAO, in Mozambique north of the \nLurio Belt (Jacobs et al., 2008) and in Tanzania, where high-grade metamorphism is also \nrecorded between 655 and 520 Ma (M\u00f6ller et al., 2000; Johnson et al., 2005). The cause \nof this localisation of post-collisional granitoids in certain areas of the EAO remains \nuncertain, although Jacobs et al. (2008) have suggested that it may be related to partial \nlithospheric delamination in specific areas of the orogen. However, it is notable that post-\ncollisional granitoids in the EAO are commonly associated both spatially and temporally \nwith major shear zones; examples of such magmatic events occurred in the ca. 550 Ma \nAngavo shear zone of central Madagascar (Gr\u00e9goire et al., 2009), after ca. 530 Ma in the \nLurio Belt of Mozambique (Bingen et al., 2009) and at 570 \u2013 520 Ma in the Palghat-\nCauvery shear zone of southern India (Santosh et al., 2005).  \n 89 \n90 \n91 \n92 \n93 \n94 \n95 \n96 \n97 \n98 \n99 \n100 \n101 \n102 \n103 \n104 \n105 \n106 \n107 \n108 \n109 \n110 \n111 \n112 \n113 \n114 \n115 \n116 \n117 \n118 \n \n2. Geology of northern Madagascar \nThe Precambrian basement of northern Madagascar consists of four main tectonic \nunits (Collins and Windley, 2002; Collins, 2006, Thomas et al., 2009). The oldest of \nthese is the Antongil Craton, on the north-east coast (Fig. 2), which comprises Archaean \northogneisses formed at ca. 3200 Ma and intruded by granitoids at ca. 2500 Ma (Tucker \net al., 1999; Paquette et al., 2003). The craton was intruded by a Palaeoproterozoic mafic \nsuite, but was apparently unaffected by Neoproterozoic magmatism (BGS-USGS-GLW, \n2008).  \nDominating most of central Madagascar, the Antananarivo Craton (Fig. 2), \ncomprises Neoarchaean orthogneisses and supracrustal rocks (2520 - 2500 Ma; Tucker et \nal., 1999; Kr\u00f6ner et al., 2000), including the Tsaratanana Sheets, which are generally \nconsidered to be allochthonous (Collins et al., 2003a). The Antananarivo Craton is \ntectonically overlain in the west by Proterozoic metasedimentary rocks of the Itremo and \nIkalamavony groups (Cox et al., 1998; Collins, 2006). The gneisses of the Antananarivo \nCraton and the overlying metasedimentary rocks were intruded at 820 \u2013 720 Ma by \nextensive granitoid plutons (Handke et al., 1999; Tucker et al., 1999; Kr\u00f6ner et al., 2000), \nand evidence for earlier magmatism at ca.1000 Ma has recently been reported (Tucker et \nal., 2007). The northern part of the Antananarivo Craton was intruded by \u2018stratoid \ngranites\u2019 at ca. 630 Ma (N\u00e9d\u00e9lec et al., 1995; Paquette and N\u00e9d\u00e9lec, 1998). High-grade \nmetamorphism, due to crustal thickening, occurred between 570 and 520 Ma (Kr\u00f6ner et \nal., 2000; de Wit et al., 2001; Tucker et al., 2007; Gr\u00e9goire et al., 2009) and post-\ncollisional granites were emplaced during the period 550 \u2013 530 Ma (Tucker et al., 1999; \nKr\u00f6ner et al., 1999, 2000; Meert et al., 2001). \nIn the northernmost part of the island, the Bemarivo Belt (Fig. 2) comprises two \ndistinct Proterozoic metamorphosed volcano-sedimentary sequences intruded by \nNeoproterozoic arc-related plutons (Thomas et al., 2009). The southern part of the belt \nconsists of a sequence of high-grade metasedimentary rocks (Sahantaha Group), which \nwere derived from a Palaeoproterozoic source, and were intruded at 750 Ma by an \nextensive suite of plutonic rocks (Thomas et al., 2009). The northern part comprises two \nca. 750 \u2013 720 Ma metamorphosed volcano-sedimentary sequences, the high-grade \nMilanoa Group and lower-grade Daraina Group. These supracrustal rocks are also \nintruded by plutonic rocks, which date from between 718 and 705 Ma (Thomas et al., \n2009). The components of the Bemarivo Belt are considered to have formed in an arc \nsetting, and were metamorphosed to varying grades during collision with cratonic \nMadagascar at 560-530 Ma (J\u00f6ns et al, 2006; Thomas et al., 2009). They were \nsubsequently intruded by post-collisional granitoids, and one pluton from this suite has \npreviously been dated at ca. 520 Ma (Buchwaldt et al., 2003; J\u00f6ns et al., 2006).  \n119 \n120 \n121 \n122 \n123 \n124 \n125 \n126 \n127 \n128 \n129 \n130 \n131 \n132 \n133 \n134 \n135 \n136 \n137 \n138 \n139 \n140 \n141 \n142 \n143 \n144 \n145 \n146 \n147 \n148 \n149 \nThe \u2018suture zone\u2019 between the Antananarivo and Antongil cratons, comprising \nparagneisses with numerous units of mafic and ultramafic rock, has been termed the \n\u2018Betsimisaraka Suture Zone\u2019 (Kr\u00f6ner et al., 2000; Collins and Windley, 2002). Our \nmapping (BGS-USGS-GLW, 2008) has defined a broadly equivalent terrane, the \nAnaboriana-Manampotsy Belt, which largely lies between the Bemarivo Belt and \nAntananarivo Craton (Fig. 2), and extends southwards roughly along the eastern side of \nthe Antananarivo Craton. This terrane consists of Neoproterozoic metasedimentary rocks \nthat underwent metamorphism and extensive migmatisation at the time of collision of the \nBemarivo Belt and Antananarivo Craton (BGS-USGS-GLW, 2008), and are intruded by \nabundant post-collisional granitoids. On its northern margin, the Anaboriana-\nManampotsy Belt is separated from the Bemarivo Belt by a steep shear zone, the \nSandrakota Shear Zone. To the south, the Anaboriana-Manampotsy Belt appears to pass \ninto the major Angavo Shear Zone of N\u00e9d\u00e9lec et al. (2000). \nBetween 2005 and 2008 the BGS-USGS-GLW consortium undertook a regional \ngeological survey of northern Madagascar, along with a regional stream sediment \nsampling programme and representative rock sampling for whole-rock geochemistry and \nU-Pb zircon geochronology. As part of this work, the voluminous post-collisional \nintrusions that occur within the northern part of the Antananarivo Craton,  the Bemarivo \nBelt and, most especially, the intervening Anaboriana-Manampotsy Belt, were mapped \nand termed the \u2018Maevarano Suite\u2019 after the river of that name, where the various phases \nof the suite are superbly exposed (Fig. 2, 3). Previous workers had identified many of the \nplutons, but had not distinguished them from the foliated, Neoproterozoic and older \nintrusions which are also exposed in the area (e.g. Besairie, 1971; Hottin, 1972). Post-\ncollisional granitoids in the Bemarivo Belt were identified by Buchwaldt et al. (2003) in \nthe Marojejy region, but their full extent and volume has only now been recognised. The \ngeology, petrography, geochemistry, age and petrogenesis of the Maevarano Suite \nplutons are the subject of this paper.  \n150 \n151 \n152 \n153 \n154 \n155 \n156 \n157 \n158 \n159 \n160 \n161 \n162 \n163 \n164 \n165 \n166 \n167 \n168 \n169 \n170 \n171 \n172 \n173 \n174 \n175 \n176 \n177 \n178 \n179 \nThe components of the Maevarano Suite were identified under a range of names \nby previous surveys. Most of the Maevarano Suite plutons were shown as \u201cgranites et \nmigmatites granito\u00efdes\u201d and \u201ccharnockites\u201d on the compilations of Besairie (1964, 1971), \nbut these also included arc-related plutonic rocks (mainly orthogneisses) in the Bemarivo \nBelt that are now known to be older, between ca. 750 and 710 Ma (Thomas et al., 2009). \nThe 1: 2 million-scale tectonic compilation of Hottin (1972) showed the post-collisional \ngranitoids in the recently defined Anaboriana-Manampotsy Belt to be older than similar \nintrusions in the Bemarivo Belt, which were indicated merely as \u201cgranito\u00efds \nindiff\u00e9renci\u00e9s\u201d. Our new geological maps are thus the first to show the true extent of this \nwidespread suite of post-collisional plutons (Fig. 2, 3; BGS-USGS-GLW, 2008).  \nPrevious work on the post-collisional plutons in northernmost Madagascar has \nbeen limited. Medium- to coarse-grained, weakly foliated \u201ccharnockite\u201d plutons, \nintruding the Bemarivo Belt in the Marojejy area (Fig. 2), gave a U-Pb (single zircon \nTIMS analysis) emplacement date of 521 \u00b1 4 Ma (Buchwaldt et al., 2003). U-Pb dating \n(in situ electron microprobe analysis of monazite) allowed J\u00f6ns et al. (2006) to identify \ntwo metamorphic stages for this area: collisional metamorphism between ca. 560 and 530 \nMa, and peak metamorphic temperatures (possibly associated with the post-collisional \nmagmatism) between ca. 520 and 510 Ma.  \n \n3. Field relationships of the Maevarano Suite \nThe Maevarano Suite consists of numerous batholiths and plutons of varying size, \nextending throughout the Bemarivo and Anaboriana-Manampotsy belts and the northern \npart of the Antananarivo Craton (Fig. 2). The intrusions are most abundant in the \nAnaboriana-Manampotsy Belt, where they form around 50% of the total outcrop area. \nThe porphyritic granite and charnockite that make up the greater volume of the suite \ncharacteristically form high mountain savannah country, with large whaleback and \npavement outcrops (Fig. 4a). These rocks underlie parts of the high mountains (>2200 m) \nof the Marojejy massif in north-east Madagascar, and the mountain massifs around \nSandra Kota, through which the Maevarano River has carved a deep gorge. Around \nSandra Kota, a single batholith is exposed over an area of some 15 000 km2, and affords \nexcellent outcrops which constitute the \u201cType Area\u201d of the suite (Fig. 3). Rocks of the \nMaevarano Suite differ from the older intrusions in the area in that they are typically \nweakly foliated to unfoliated, although a more intense foliation is typically developed at \npluton margins and within ductile shear zones (Fig 4b, c). The older intrusions of the \nsuite tend to be more pervasively foliated than the younger intrusions. \n180 \n181 \n182 \n183 \n184 \n185 \n186 \n187 \n188 \n189 \n190 \n191 \n192 \n193 \n194 \n195 \n196 \n197 \n198 \n199 \n200 \n201 \n202 \n203 \n204 \n205 \n206 \n207 \n208 \nThe plutons of the Maevarano Suite are chiefly granitic, including some \ncharnockitic (orthopyroxene-bearing) types, but range through granodiorites to \nmonzonites and syenites (generally quartz-bearing). Some minor mafic (dioritic to \ngabbroic) intrusions, which have igneous textures, are intimately associated with the acid \nrocks in the field (Fig. 4 e,f). The whole suite can be broadly divided into three magmatic \nphases: an early phase of foliated intrusions, which are most commonly granodioritic; a \nmain phase of voluminous granitoid and charnockite plutons; and a late phase comprising \nchiefly granites and monzogranites.  \n3.1 Early phase \nThe early phase of the Maevarano Suite includes both the most mafic and the \nmost pervasively deformed intrusions. For example, early biotite- and hornblende-bearing \ngranodioritic to monzodioritic orthogneisses form elongate intrusions that crop out in the \nMaevarano River valley (Fig. 3). One such body has been dated for this study. The \nMaevarano Suite also includes minor volumes of early mafic phases, including \nhomogeneous, medium- to coarse-grained, greenish-grey, foliated quartz-diorite, and \ncoarse- to medium-grained, dark-grey to blue-grey gabbro. The gabbros in particular are \ntypically associated with, and cut by, intrusions of porphyritic granite, often in complex \nassociations, with several cross-cutting phases (Fig. 4e, f). For this reason these mafic \nintrusions are attributed to the early phase of the suite, but they have not been dated. \nSmall pyroxenite pods occur at a few locations, though their relationship to the rest of the \nsuite is uncertain. \n209 \n210 \n211 \n212 \n213 \n214 \n215 \n216 \n217 \n218 \n219 \n220 \n221 \n222 \n223 \n224 \n225 \n226 \n227 \n228 \n229 \n230 \n231 \n232 \n233 \n234 \n235 \n236 \n237 \n238 \n3.2 Main phase \nThe most common lithology of the Maevarano Suite is very coarse-grained, fairly \nhomogeneous, pinkish, typically porphyritic, biotite \u00b1 hornblende granite, with subhedral \nto euhedral, pink K-feldspar megacrysts up to 2.5 cm in size. These granites form some \nof the largest intrusions in the Maevarano Suite, irregular in shape and of batholithic \nproportions. Large bodies of orthopyroxene-bearing granite are commonly associated \nwith the porphyritic granites and have been mapped as charnockite (BGS-USGS-GLW, \n2008).  Typically, they are coarse- to very coarse-grained, locally potassium feldspar- or \nplagioclase-phyric (phenocrysts up to 2 cm across), and fresh samples are characterised \nby the classic dark green colouration and resinous lustre, together with the presence of \nmacroscopic orthopyroxene (Fig. 4d). Many of these charnockite bodies occur in \nassociation with pink porphyritic granite, but contacts between the two are rarely \nexposed. Medium- to coarse-grained, non-porphyritic granitoids are also relatively \ncommon, and considered to be part of the main granite-charnockite phase.  \nThe central parts of the main phase plutons are typically unfoliated or weakly \nfoliated, but a fabric defined by orientation of planar minerals commonly appears towards \npluton margins. Locally, the porphyritic granitoids have been transformed to strongly \nflattened augen gneisses in ductile shear zones up to several hundreds of metres wide \n(Fig. 3). In undeformed zones, a primary, igneous flow orientation of K-feldspar \nphenocrysts has been locally observed.  \nEnclave-rich zones are common within the Maevarano Suite granitoids. The \nenclaves either take the form of well-defined, discoidal, magmatic enclaves, or more \ndiffuse, partially digested and feldspathised mafic xenoliths stoped from the enclosing \ncountry rock gneisses. In some areas, rafts up to hundreds of metres long of country rock \ngranite and gneiss occur within the granite, particularly close to its margins. Enclaves are \nless commonly observed within the charnockites and, where seen, tend to have much \nhigher contents of mafic minerals than those within the granites.  \n3.3 Late phase \nWithin the Anaboriana-Manampotsy Belt, a number of later plutons intrude the \nporphyritic granites of the main phase (Fig. 3). In the northern part of the belt, elliptical \nmonzogranite plutons up to 5 km across intrude the porphyritic granitoids, and one of \nthese has been dated during this study. These monzogranites are typically coarse-grained, \nequigranular, weakly foliated (strongly foliated at the margins), grey to pinkish-grey, and \nbiotite- and amphibole-bearing. Syenite plutons are also reported from inaccessible \nregions in the Bealanana area (BGS-USGS-GLW, 2008). Other intrusions belonging to \nthe late phase, which also intrude main phase plutons, include variably foliated \nleucogranite sheets (Fig. 3), one of which has been dated in this study, and late, dyke-like \nintrusions up to 2 km long of unfoliated microgranite. One of the most distinctive of the \nlate phase intrusions is the ring-like Tampoketsa massif in the southern part of the \nAnaboriana-Manampotsy Belt. It forms a pronounced circular topographic feature that \nattains an altitude of nearly 1400 m and appears to be a primary igneous feature, not due \nto late domal folding. The Tampoketsa intrusion is extremely magnetic compared to the \nsurrounding rocks and forms a major positive aeromagnetic anomaly. Summit exposures \nshow the main lithology to be light grey-pink, fine- to medium-grained, biotite-\nhornblende alkaline microgranite with a variably-developed foliation. It is included with \nthe Maevarano Suite on the basis of lithological, petrographical and fabric similarities, \nbut it has not been dated.  \n239 \n240 \n241 \n242 \n243 \n244 \n245 \n246 \n247 \n248 \n249 \n250 \n251 \n252 \n253 \n254 \n255 \n256 \n257 \n258 \n259 \n260 \n261 \n262 \n263 \n264 \n265 \n266 \n267 \n268 \nLate minor veins, sheets and irregular intrusions are not common but do occur \nlocally. They include pegmatitic and aplitic granite intrusions, which tend to occur in \nsmall swarms, and larger bodies of fine- to medium-grained granite. These are considered \nto represent the youngest part of the late phase of the Maevarano Suite.  \n \n4. Petrography \n4.1 Early phase \nThe early phase intrusions are the most mafic parts of the Maevarano Suite, \nranging from granodiorites, monzonites and monzodiorites, to diorites and gabbros. All \nare medium- to coarse-grained. In the granitoids, plagioclase (20-30%) dominates over \nK-feldspar (up to 10%). Up to 25% quartz is present, and mafic minerals include biotite, \nclinopyroxene and amphibole in varying amounts. Minerals are typically allotriomorphic \nand show a strong preferred orientation.  \n269 \n270 \n271 \n272 \n273 \n274 \n275 \n276 \n277 \n278 \n279 \n280 \n281 \n282 \n283 \n284 \n285 \n286 \n287 \n288 \n289 \n290 \n291 \n292 \n293 \n294 \n295 \n296 \nSamples of gabbro consist of plagioclase (~30-40%), clinopyroxene (25-35%), \namphibole (10-20%), biotite (5-10%), and opaque minerals (up to 5%) along with \naccessory titanite and apatite. Up to 5% quartz occurs in some samples. While the \nhydrous minerals (amphibole and mica) are clearly of secondary origin, primary sub-\nophitic textures are locally preserved.  \n4.2 Main phase \nTypical porphyritic granite samples are coarse-grained hypersolvus granites, with \nmicroperthitic potassium feldspar phenocrysts up to 2.5 cm in size, though averaging 1.5 \ncm. Overgrowths of plagioclase on the potassium feldspar phenocrysts are present in a \nfew samples. The modal mineralogy comprises quartz (~20-30%), poikilitic K-feldspar \n(microperthitic microcline, ~30-40%), plagioclase (~15-20%), greenish-brown amphibole \n(~10%), brown biotite (5-10%), clinopyroxene relics (up to 5 %) and accessory opaque \nmineral phases (up to 3%), apatite, zircon \u00b1 allanite, with epidote, chlorite and muscovite \nas minor alteration products. Myrmekitic quartz-feldspar intergrowths are common. \nFeldspars are generally fresh, showing only limited amounts of alteration, and textures \nare most commonly granoblastic. The charnockitic phases have broadly similar \nmineralogy to the porphyritic granites, but with 5-20% orthopyroxene. In most samples, \nthe orthopyroxene is highly altered, and largely replaced by amphibole.  \n4.3 Late phase \nLate phase granitoids are predominantly medium-grained, with allotriomorphic \ntextures, and are commonly quite fresh, although feldspars are locally sericitised. K-\nfeldspar (microperthitic microcline, ~ 25-40%) predominates over plagioclase (10-20%) \nwith up to 30% quartz. Mafic minerals are amphibole and biotite, with similar accessories \nto the granitoids of the main phase.  \n \n5. Geochronology \nFour samples belonging to the Maevarano Suite were selected for U-Pb zircon \ngeochronology. All the samples are from plutons emplaced into the Anaboriana-\nManampotsy Belt, where the Maevarano Suite intrusions are at their most voluminous. \nLocation information for the samples is given as grid references using the Laborde grid, \nand localities are shown on Figs. 2 and 3.  The zircon data are given in electronic \nsupplemental data tables A-D. The samples were chosen from older and younger phases, \non the basis of field relations, in order to bracket the emplacement age of the entire suite. \nThe charnockite phase from the Marojejy area in the Bemarivo Belt has been dated at 521 \n\u00b1 4 Ma (Buchwaldt et al., 2003), so was not reinvestigated in this study. Three of our \nsamples were taken from the Maevarano River valley, where the field relationships \nbetween the phases are clear. From this region we collected samples of: the early phase \n(foliated quartz monzodiorite), which occurs as raft-like bodies in the porphyritic granite; \na foliated late phase leucogranite sheet cutting the porphyritic granite; and a late phase \nmonzonite pluton which intrudes both leuco- and porphyritic granite. The fourth sample \nwas collected from further south, where late veins and irregular bodies of granite cut \nmigmatitic gneisses of the Anaboriana-Manampotsy Belt.  \n297 \n298 \n299 \n300 \n301 \n302 \n303 \n304 \n305 \n306 \n307 \n308 \n309 \n310 \n311 \n312 \n313 \n314 \n315 \n316 \n317 \n318 \n319 \n320 \n321 \n322 \n323 \n324 \n325 \n326 \n5.1 Methodology  \nZircons were separated from large, fresh rock samples using standard crushing, \nwashing, heavy liquid separation (LST and MI liquids) and magnetic separation (Frantz \nIsodynamic Separator) techniques, followed by hand-picking under a binocular \nmicroscope. The grains were mounted in epoxy, and polished mid-section to expose their \ncentre. Mounts were imaged using transmitted and reflected optical microscopy as well as \nby cathodoluminescence (CL) on a Scanning Electron Microscope.  \nThe zircons were dated using the Sensitive High Resolution Ion Microprobe \n(SHRIMP) at Curtin University of Technology, Perth, Western Australia. Methodologies \nfor SHRIMP analyses followed those described in De Waele and Pisarevsky (2008). \nCommon Pb correction was carried out, using measured 204Pb, and applying a common \nPb composition appropriate for the age of the zircon, following Stacey and Kramers \n(1975). All pooled ages are reported at 95% confidence levels, while single data are \nreported at 1\u03c3 \uf020confidence level. SHRIMP data were reduced using the Squid plug-in for \nExcel (Ludwig, 2001a), and plotted and interpreted using the Isoplot plug-in for Excel \n(Ludwig, 2001b). All data are plotted uncorrected for non-radiogenic Pb. \n327 \n328 \n329 \n330 \n331 \n332 \n333 \n334 \n335 \n336 \n337 \n338 \n339 \n340 \n341 \n342 \n343 \n344 \n345 \n346 \n347 \n348 \n349 \n350 \n351 \n352 \n353 \n354 \n355 \n356 \n5.2 Sample BT\/07\/12 [grid ref. 617845 1280192] \nSample BT\/07\/12 is a foliated quartz monzodiorite of the early phase, taken from \nlarge river outcrops and pavements in the Maevarano River near Ambodirafia (Fig. 3). \nThe sampled lithology is medium- to coarse-grained, fresh, grey, hornblende-biotite \nquartz monzodiorite, with a strong, sub-vertical foliation trending SSE-NNW. It is fairly \nhomogeneous, but locally has a weak layering defined by variations in grain size and \nmineralogy, and most notably by layers with more or less K-feldspar. The rocks are \nweakly migmatitic, with <5% layer-parallel leucocratic veins. These foliated quartz \nmonzodiorites to granodiorites occur as large enclaves, up to several hundreds of metres \nwide, surrounded and veined by very coarse-grained, pink, porphyritic granite of the main \nphase of the Maevarano Suite.  \nZircons from sample BT\/07\/12 range in size from 50 to 200 \u03bcm and have length \nto width ratios between 1:1 and 3:1. The crystals are rounded to subrounded and appear \ncolourless to pale pink in transmitted light. Most zircons contain some cracks, but have \nonly very small amounts of inclusions. CL images reveal dark CL-response, and faint \nparallel zoning patterns (Fig. 5a-b). Some zircons appear to be overgrown by large high-\nresponse domains that show no zoning. Large invasive zones of homogenisation, \nrecognised in many zircons, are interpreted to record solid-state recrystallisation.  \n16 analyses were conducted on this sample and indicate low f206 values up to \n1.14% (Table A). U and Th are in the range 71-379 and 91-495 ppm respectively, with \nthe exception of analysis 6 (1196 and 2066 ppm). Th\/U ratios are between 0.29 and 2.82, \nextending well beyond the typical ratios expected for magmatic zircon (0.5<Th\/U<1.0),  \npossibly due to some Th\/U fractionation during solid-state recrystallisation. \nApart from three data points that record the highest common lead (Pbc) values, the \ndata on cores define a concordant cluster (Fig. 6). The seven most concordant analyses \nyield a concordia age of 531 \u00b1 5 Ma (MSWD of concordance = 2.0). The relatively high \nMSWD of concordance indicates some scatter in the dataset, but the age represents the \nbest estimate for crystallisation of zircon cores in sample BT\/07\/12. Six analyses \nconducted on unzoned high-CL rims, although discordant due to incorrect correction for \nPbc, seem to record slightly younger crystallisation ages around ~520 Ma. Although this \nage cannot be fully resolved based on the data obtained, it does suggest crystallisation of \nthese rims immediately after the emplacement of the granite, perhaps from late-stage \nfluids associated with the intrusion of the main phase granites. \n357 \n358 \n359 \n360 \n361 \n362 \n363 \n364 \n365 \n366 \n367 \n368 \n369 \n370 \n371 \n372 \n373 \n374 \n375 \n376 \n377 \n378 \n379 \n380 \n381 \n382 \n383 \n384 \n385 \n5.3 Sample BT\/07\/22 [grid ref. 610788 1269827] \nSample BT\/07\/22 is from a small elliptical, late phase pluton near the Maevarano \nRiver, where tor-like outcrops are characterised by a curious \u201cfluted\u201d, pot-holed \nappearance. This pluton intrudes the main, porphyritic phase of the Maevarano Suite, and \nis foliated within a few tens of metres of its margins, but elsewhere essentially unfoliated. \nThe sample is a homogeneous, slightly foliated, pinkish-grey, medium- to coarse-grained, \nbiotite-amphibole monzogranite. Sparse K-feldspars, up to 8 mm in size, are largely \nperthitic. The rock contains a few discrete, spherical microdiorite xenoliths which were \ncarefully excluded from the analysed sample. \nZircon grains range in size from 100 to 300 \u03bcm and have aspect ratios between \n2:1 and 4:1 (Fig. 5c-d). The crystals are clear, colourless to pale pink, and are commonly \ncracked. CL imaging indicates single sector zoning, with alternating dark- and light-CL \nzones (Fig. 5c-d). Zoning patterns and the high aspect ratios of most crystals suggest a \nmagmatic origin. \n16 analyses were conducted and give f206 values between 0 and 2.66 (Table B). U \nand Th values are low, between 26-128 and 46-239 ppm respectively, leading to high \nproportions of apparent Pbc based on very low counts on 204Pb. None of the analyses \nrecorded more than 1 count over 10 second intervals, similar to measurements on \nbackground, and this is taken to indicate extremely low Pbc. Uncorrected data plot on \nconcordia and define a concordia age of 522 \u00b1 6 Ma (MSWD of concordance = 0.50, Fig. \n6), which we take to reflect the emplacement age of the monzogranite. One younger \nanalysis could represent crystallisation of zircon at ca. 464\u00b110 Ma (analysis 8), but more \nlikely represents a zircon that lost Pb. \n5.4 Sample BT\/07\/25 [grid ref. 606786 1267524] \nSample BT\/07\/25 is from a late phase intrusion of the Maevarano Suite which \nlargely comprises fine- to medium-grained, foliated, biotite-bearing microgranite, and \nwhich intrudes the porphyritic granite. The foliation in rocks of this microgranite is \nvariable, but commonly quite strong, and defined by small variations in mineralogy and \ngrain size. A slightly coarser-grained quartz-feldspar facies forms discontinuous layers \nand blebs, defining a weak, diffuse layering.  No mafic enclaves, blebs or schlieren have \nbeen observed \u2013 the rocks are typically homogeneous at the outcrop scale. The sample is \na light grey, medium- to fine-grained, pinkish microgranite with a weak foliation formed \nby alignment of mafic aggregates.  \n386 \n387 \n388 \n389 \n390 \n391 \n392 \n393 \n394 \n395 \n396 \n397 \n398 \n399 \n400 \n401 \n402 \n403 \n404 \n405 \n406 \n407 \n408 \n409 \n410 \n411 \n412 \n413 \n414 \nZircon crystals are between 100 and 250 \u03bcm in size, and have aspect ratios \nbetween 2:1 and 5:1 (Fig. 5e-f). The crystals are sub- to euhedral in shape, and have well-\ndefined crystal terminations. The crystals are virtually free of inclusions and cracks, and \nvary between colourless and pale pink. CL images show concentric and parallel zones \nthat suggest a magmatic origin (Fig. 5e-f). A small number of larger zircons appear to \nhave a homogenous inner dark-CL core, overgrown by a medium-CL homogenous rim. \n15 analyses were conducted on 15 zoned crystals and indicated low contents of \nPbc with f206 between 0 and 1.09%, corresponding to less than one count on 204Pb every \nten seconds (Table C). U and Th contents are in the range 161-734 and 116-1936 ppm \nrespectively, giving Th\/U ratios between 0.57 and 2.85.  \nThe data plot in a broad cluster on concordia, and the nine most concordant points \n(after correction for non-radiogenic Pb) correspond to a concordia age of 527 \u00b1 5 Ma \n(MSWD of concordance=0.005), which we take to represent the best age estimate for the \nemplacement of the microgranite (Fig. 6). The data points that plot slightly away from \nthis concordant cluster correspond to analyses that either recorded higher counts on 204Pb, \nor some noise resulting in background counts in excess of counts on 204Pb (but always \nless than 1 count every 10 seconds). One analysis (15) recorded a concordant 206Pb\/238U \nage of 541 \u00b1 8 Ma, and may represent a slightly older xenocrystic component in the \nsample.  \n5.5 Sample RK7248A [grid ref. 632500 1175988] \nSample RK7248A was collected from a ridge within the Anaboriana-Manampotsy \nBelt (Fig. 2), with numerous rock pavements of agmatitic gneiss with a blocky grey \ngneiss palaeosome surrounded by granitic leucosome, and cut by discrete veins and \nirregular bodies of granite. The analysed sample was taken from one of the late granite \nbodies.   \n415 \n416 \n417 \n418 \n419 \n420 \n421 \n422 \n423 \n424 \n425 \n426 \n427 \n428 \n429 \n430 \n431 \n432 \n433 \n434 \n435 \n436 \n437 \n438 \n439 \n440 \n441 \n442 \n443 \n444 \nZircon crystals range in size from 100 to 200 \u03bcm and have aspect ratios between \n2:1 and 5:1. The crystals are sub- to euhedral with well-developed terminations, \ncolourless to pale pink, with very few inclusions and virtually no cracks. CL images \nreveal broad parallel or concentric zoning patterns consistent with magmatic \ncrystallisation (Fig. 5g-h). Several zircon grains are overgrown by narrow high-CL \nunzoned rims, possibly related to a thermal episode that led to neocrystallisation of low-U \nrims. \n21 analyses yielded f206 values between 0 and 0.96%. U and Th are in the ranges \n104-495 ppm and 53-217 ppm respectively, giving Th\/U ratios between 0.25 and 1.12, \nlargely within the range expected for magmatic zircon (Table D). The data define a broad \ncluster around concordia with weighted mean 206Pb\/238U age of 532 \u00b1 6 Ma (MSWD=5.4) \n(Fig. 6). The high MSWD value for this calculation indicates significant scatter of \n206Pb\/238U ratios, interpreted to reflect some Pb-loss in the zircons. Using only concordant \ndata, a concordia age of 537 \u00b1 5 Ma (MSWD=0.35) can be calculated, which is \ninterpreted as the best estimate for the age of crystallisation of zircon in the sample. High \nCL rims and magmatically zoned core domains provide similar ages, and this may \nindicate that emplacement of the granitic protolith took place during a thermal event that \ninduced migmatisation and fluid mobility in the rock. \nIn summary, the four analysed samples show a narrow spread of emplacement \nages from 537 \u00b1 5 to 522 \u00b1 6 Ma. The younger end of this range is consistent with the \nemplacement of the Marojejy charnockite in the southern Bemarivo Belt at 520.9 \u00b1 4.2 \nMa (Buchwaldt et al., 2003) and in keeping with the age ranges of metamorphism in the \nsame area (J\u00f6ns et al., 2006, 2009). Very few older, inherited zircons were found, \nsuggesting that these magmas did not undergo substantial crustal contamination.  \n \n6. Geochemistry  445 \n446 \n447 \n448 \n449 \n450 \n451 \n452 \n453 \n454 \n455 \n456 \n457 \n458 \n459 \n460 \n461 \n462 \n463 \n464 \n465 \n466 \n467 \n468 \n469 \n470 \n471 \n472 \n473 \n474 \n30 whole-rock samples from representative Maevarano Suite intrusions and \nphases have been analysed for major, trace and rare earth elements. Fresh rock samples \nselected for geochemistry were crushed and milled in agate at the DMG Laboratory of the \nMinistry of Energy and Mines in Antananarivo, and analysed at ACTLABS, Canada (by \ntheir Code 4 Lithoresearch package). Major oxides and some trace elements were \nanalysed by Li-metaborate \/ tetraborate fusion with an ICP analysis, and these sample \nsolutions were further diluted and spiked for ICP-MS analysis. The samples were run for \nmajor oxides and selected trace elements on a combination simultaneous\/sequential \nThermo Jarrell-Ash ENVIRO II ICP or a Spectro Cirros ICP, and for other trace elements \non a Perkin Elmer SCIEX ELAN 6000 or 6100 ICP-MS. The data are given in Table 1; \ndetails of repeat analyses on standards are presented as supplemental data in Table E.. \nThe majority of samples (20) are granitoid rocks, including porphyritic granites \nand charnockites, of the main granite-charnockite phase of the Maevarano Suite. Just one \n(dated) granitoid sample is from the early phase, and four samples are gabbros that are \nalso considered to belong to the early phase. Five samples are from the late phase, and \ninclude the dated monzogranite and leucogranite, along with the Tampoketsa alkaline \ngranite.  \nThe analysed samples show a wide range in SiO2 content, from 45 to 78 wt%, the \ngabbros having < 55 wt% SiO2 (Fig. 7). The majority of samples are low in MgO (<3%) \nand show a negative correlation with SiO2 (Fig. 7a), although the early phase samples \n(gabbros and foliated quartz monzodiorite) have notably higher MgO (> 3.0%) than \ngranitoid samples with similar SiO2. As would be expected, Fe2O3 shows a strong \nnegative correlation with SiO2 (Fig. 7b), with the highest Fe2O3 contents in the gabbros \n(> 10%) although some charnockites are also Fe2O3-rich. All granitoid samples are high \nin K2O (>3.5%) whereas gabbro samples have K2O < 3.5% (Fig. 7c), and there is no \napparent correlation between K2O and SiO2 (Fig. 7c); this suggests buffering by a K-\nbearing phase such as amphibole, phlogopite or K-feldspar during evolution of the \nmagmas (Williams et al., 2004). K2O\/Na2O is >1 in most samples, again with the \nexception of the four gabbro samples which have K2O\/Na2O < 1. In the Total Alkalis vs \nSilica (TAS) plot (Fig. 7d), most of the samples are alkalic under the classification of \nMiyashiro (1974). This plot is most appropriate for volcanic rocks, and only provides a \ncrude method of classifying plutonic rocks. However, it is notable that, despite high \nmodal contents of K-feldspar, very few Maevarano Suite samples actually have the bulk \ncomposition of true granite; many fall in the broad syenite and syeno-diorite fields, which \nalso encompass monzonitic compositions. The analysed samples are largely \nmetaluminous (molar A\/CNK < 1) (Fig. 8a), although the most SiO2 rich samples are \nweakly peraluminous, suggesting the possibility of some crustal contamination of these \nmagmas.  \n475 \n476 \n477 \n478 \n479 \n480 \n481 \n482 \n483 \n484 \n485 \n486 \n487 \n488 \n489 \n490 \n491 \n492 \n493 \n494 \n495 \n496 \n497 \n498 \n499 \n500 \n501 \n502 \n503 \n504 \n505 \nIn magmatic suites, such as the Maevarano Suite, that do not appear to have \nsuffered extensive post-crystallisation alteration, it is common to attempt to discriminate \nthe tectonic setting of granitoids using discrimination diagrams such as those of Pearce et \nal. (1984). Granitoid samples from the Maevarano Suite are plotted on the (Y+Nb) vs Rb \nplot of Pearce et al. (1984) (Fig. 8b) and although most plot in the within-plate granite \nfield, there is an overlap into the volcanic arc and syn-collisional granite fields. This \nspread across fields is common in post-collisional granites (Pearce, 1996) and the \nMaevarano Suite shows the same spread as other post-collisional granitoids from the \nEAO (e.g. Roland, 2004; K\u00fcster and Harms, 1998). On the Ga\/Al vs. Zr plot of Whalen \net al. (1987) the Maevarano Suite granitoids plot in the field of A-type granites (Fig. 8c), \nas do other EAO post-collisional granites (Roland, 2004; K\u00fcster and Harms, 1998). In the \nA-type granite classification of Eby (1990, 1992) the Maevarano Suite granitoids spread \nacross the A1 and A2 fields (Fig. 8d). Post-collisional granitoids would normally be \nexpected to fall in the A2 field, which indicates magmas that may have been derived by \nre-melting of crust. In contrast, magmas in the A1 field are more likely to have been \nderived from mantle sources (Eby, 1992).  \nSamples from the early phase show many consistent trace element characteristics \n(Fig. 9a). Most are relatively enriched in Ba, K, and the LREE, with negative Ta-Nb \nanomalies and depletion in the HREE relative to the LREE (LaN\/YbN typically > 10). One \nanalysed sample, KGM48, lacks a Nb-Ta anomaly and has a relatively flat slope from the \nLREE to the HREE, and it is possible that this intrusion was derived a different source to \nthe other Maevarano Suite magmas. Sample 497-JM-07 shows positive Sr, Ti and Eu \nanomalies, suggesting that its bulk composition has been modified by crystal \naccumulation (plagioclase and ilmenite) and cannot be used to approximate a magmatic \ncomposition.  \n506 \n507 \n508 \n509 \n510 \n511 \n512 \n513 \n514 \n515 \n516 \n517 \n518 \n519 \n520 \n521 \n522 \n523 \n524 \n525 \n526 \n527 \n528 \n529 \n530 \n531 \n532 \n533 \n534 \n535 \nThe more evolved samples of the main granite-charnockite phase show higher \ncontents of some of the Large Ion Lithophile Elements (LILE) (especially Rb, Th and K) \nthan the mafic samples of the early phase (Fig. 9b), but have many similar characteristics \nincluding negative Nb-Ta anomalies and fractionated REE patterns (LaN\/YbN > 10). \nStrong negative Sr and Ti anomalies (and in one case a weak Eu anomaly) in the main \nphase samples indicate that plagioclase and a Ti-rich mineral such as titanite or ilmenite \nwere fractionated as the magmas evolved.  \nSamples from the late magmatic phases can be divided into two groups on the \nbasis of their trace element patterns (Fig. 9c). Monzogranites and leucogranites of the \nMaevarano River area have similar trace element patterns to the main phase granites, \nthough strong Eu and Sr negative anomalies indicate that these magmas are highly \nevolved. Two samples from the Tampoketsa granite have pronounced negative Nb-Ta \nanomalies and very low contents of the HREE (LaN\/YbN > 80). These differences may \nindicate a different source for this unusual intrusion. Low contents of HREE commonly \nindicate the presence of garnet in the source of the magmas, and so it is possible that the \nparental magma of the Tampoketsa granite was derived from greater depth than those of \nother parts of the Maevarano Suite.  \nThe similarity in geochemistry between most phases of the Maevarano Suite \nsupports the assignation of these intrusions to a single magmatic suite. These intrusions \nshow many of the typical features that have been recognised in post-collisional granitoids \nof the EAO (K\u00fcster and Harms, 1998; N\u00e9delec et al., 1995; Roland, 2004), including: \nhigh contents of the LILE, especially K; negative Nb-Ta anomalies; and enrichment of \nthe LREE over the HREE. Perhaps the single most distinctive feature of these and other \npost-collisional granitoids is that they plot in the A-type granite fields on discrimination \ndiagrams, yet have strong negative Nb-Ta anomalies which would not be expected in \ngranitoids formed in an intracontinental rift setting (Whalen et al., 1987).  \n \n7.

Both \nfield and geochronological evidence show that the suite was emplaced shortly after the \nmain deformation associated with the Malagasy orogeny \u2013 the last orogenic event to \naffect the East African Orogen in Madagascar (Collins and Pisarevsky, 2005; Collins, \n2006). In the field, some exposures show that the intrusive rocks, particularly of the late \nphase, cut the main foliation in their country rocks. However, the contacts of granitoids of \nthe main phase are commonly broadly parallel to the regional fabrics and the granites are \nthemselves foliated at pluton margins, but unfoliated in their cores. Components of the \nearly phase tend to be pervasively foliated and form elongate bodies that are parallel to \nthe foliation in the host rocks. This indicates that the Maevarano Suite magmatism largely \npost-dated the main crustal thickening event, but that the early phase intrusions were \nemplaced during its waning stages.  \nIn its type area, the Maevarano Suite is associated with a number of ductile shear \nzones. This is a common association for post-collisional granites in the EAO, and in some \nareas the later deformation on the shear zones has been associated with orogenic collapse \n(Jacobs and Thomas, 2004; Jacobs et al., 2008; Bingen et al., 2009; Gr\u00e9goire et al., 2009; \nViola et al., 2008). Although field evidence for this is limited in northern Madagascar, we \ncan use these analogies to tentatively suggest that the earliest Maevarano Suite magmas \nwere emplaced at the end of the collisional event, but that voluminous main phase \nmagmatism was associated with extensional collapse of the orogen, with extensional \nshear zones providing the pathways for magma ascent.  \nThe observed field relationships are consistent with the geochronology; high-\ngrade metamorphism in north Madagascar peaked at ca. 560 \u2013 530 Ma (J\u00f6ns et al., 2006, \n2009), and our work has shown that the earlier, foliated phases of the Maevarano Suite \nwere emplaced at ca. 537 \u2013 531 Ma, with magmatism continuing until 520 Ma. A similar \npattern is recognised in central Madagascar, where metamorphism on the Angavo Shear \nZone occurred at ca. 550 Ma (Gr\u00e9goire et al., 2009) followed by magmatism at ca. 550 \u2013 \n530 Ma (Tucker et al., 1999; Kr\u00f6ner et al., 1999, 2000; Meert et al., 2001). \nPetrography and geochemical analyses demonstrate that the Maevarano Suite \nintrusions share many features - such as LILE enrichment, negative Nb-Ta anomalies, \nand LREE enrichment over the HREE - with other post-collisional granitoids along the \nlength of the EAO. A number of apparent contradictions characterise these post-\ncollisional granitoids: for instance, charnockites typically indicate water-undersaturated \nmagmas, yet they are associated with amphibole-bearing granites that are likely to have \nformed from hydrous magmas. Similarly, discrimination diagrams indicate that these are \nA-type granites, yet they have the strong Nb-Ta negative anomaly commonly found in \narc settings. Such Nb-Ta anomalies could be partly caused by contamination with local \ncrustal material, but it is notable that the anomalies are present even in the most mafic \nmagmas that are likely to be relatively uncontaminated. The lack of older xenocrystic \nzircons in the dated samples also provides an argument against substantial crustal \ncontamination of the magmas.  \n566 \n567 \n568 \n569 \n570 \n571 \n572 \n573 \n574 \n575 \n576 \n577 \n578 \n579 \n580 \n581 \n582 \n583 \n584 \n585 \n586 \n587 \n588 \n589 \n590 \n591 \n592 \n593 \n594 \n595 \n596 \nThe consistency of many main geochemical features of post-collisional intrusions \nalong the EAO suggests the likelihood of a common source for the majority of these \nmagmas. The granitoids are largely metaluminous, rather than peraluminous, indicating \nthat they were not generated solely by the melting of local crustal material, although the \nmore silica-rich magmas are likely to have been affected by some crustal contamination. \nRecent studies have proposed that the source of post-collisional magmas elsewhere in the \nEAO was in the mafic lower crust (e.g. Jacobs et al., 2008); but the lower crust is likely \nto be depleted in the LILE rather than enriched (Pearce, 1996), and so does not represent \na feasible source for the K-rich Maevarano Suite. A growing consensus (e.g. Pearce, \n1996; Li\u00e9geois et al., 1998; Bonin, 2004) is that the source for K-rich post-collisional \nmagmas is in the sub-continental lithospheric mantle (SCLM), which has been \nheterogeneously enriched through metasomatism by LILE-enriched fluids derived by \ndehydration of a subducting slab. Such slab fluids are typically characterised by low Nb-\nTa contents (Fitton, 1995) and thus the enriched SCLM would also have low amounts of \nthese elements. Partial melting of such a source could produce the LILE-enriched, Nb-\nTa- poor magmas of the Maevarano Suite, and we suggest that other post-collisional \nmagmas in the EAO were also derived from metasomatised SCLM. In northern \nMadagascar, there is abundant evidence for subduction during the Neoproterozoic, prior \nto collision of the terranes that make up the island (e.g., arc-like magmas; Thomas et al., \n2009), and enrichment of the SCLM could have occurred at this time. In the north of the \nEAO, alkaline parts of the post-collisional granitoid suite have similarly been attributed \nto a lithospheric mantle source that was metasomatised during Neoproterozoic subduction \n(Be\u2019eri-Shlevin et al., 2009b). \n597 \n598 \n599 \n600 \n601 \n602 \n603 \n604 \n605 \n606 \n607 \n608 \n609 \n610 \n611 \n612 \n613 \n614 \n615 \n616 \n617 \n618 \n619 \n620 \n621 \n622 \n623 \n624 \n625 \n626 \nThe transition from crustal shortening to extension in many orogenic belts, \nincluding the EAO, has been explained in terms of delamination of part, or all, of the sub-\ncontinental lithospheric mantle (Houseman and Mackenzie, 1981; Black and Li\u00e9geois, \n1993; Jacobs et al., 2008). Such delamination allows hot asthenospheric material to well \nup, heating the upper part of the lithospheric mantle and promoting melting (Schott and \nSchmeling, 1998). Bonin (2004) proposed a model for collisional to post-collisional \nmagmatism that commences with lithospheric stacking, producing peraluminous magmas \nderived by melting of continental crust which mingle with small-degree potassic melts \nfrom the SCLM. This is followed by slab break-off and lithospheric delamination, \nremoving part of the lithospheric mantle keel and melting the upper part of the SCLM to \nproduce medium- to high-K magmas. Finally, this model (Bonin, 2004) suggests that \nover a period of millions of years the SCLM thickens by cooling and underplating of \ndeeper material, and alkaline magmas of within-plate type are derived from deeper levels. \nThe majority of the Maevarano Suite magmas can be related to the slab break-off\/ \nlithospheric delamination stage of this model. However, the youngest Tampoketsa granite \nmay have been formed by melting of deeper SCLM and could represent the evolution to a \ntrue within-plate setting; it is possible that it is rather younger than the rest of the \nMaevarano Suite.  \nWithin northern Madagascar, the Maevarano Suite intrusions are abundant within \nsome crustal units (the Anaboriana-Manampotsy and Bemarivo belts, and parts of the \nAntananarivo Craton) but are absent in others (the Antongil Craton). Two explanations \ncan be postulated: 1) a suitable source was not present beneath the Antongil Craton; 2) \nstructural controls led to the emplacement of magmas only in certain areas.  \nEvidence to support the first explanation comes from study of the Neoproterozoic \nhistory of the terranes of northern Madagascar. The Bemarivo Belt and the Antananarivo \nCraton both contain abundant Neoproterozoic subduction-related magmatic suites (820-\n700 Ma; Handke et al., 1999; Tucker et al., 1999; Kr\u00f6ner et al., 2000; Thomas et al., \n2009), which provide evidence for a subduction event prior to collision that could have \nenriched the SCLM. The country rocks of the Anaboriana-Manampotsy Belt are entirely \nNeoproterozoic (BGS-USGS-GLW, 2008) and may represent an arc sequence preserved \nwithin the suture zone between continental fragments.  In contrast, there is no evidence of \nNeoproterozoic magmatism within the Antongil Craton (BGS-USGS-GLW, 2008). We \ntherefore postulate that the SCLM beneath the Antongil Craton was not enriched by \nsubduction-related fluids prior to continental collision, and thus was less hydrous and \nmore viscous than the SCLM beneath other parts of northern Madagascar. This unaltered \nlithospheric mantle may simply not have delaminated (e.g. Elkins-Tanton, 2005), or may \nhave lacked fusible material that could be melted to produce post-collisional magmas.  \n627 \n628 \n629 \n630 \n631 \n632 \n633 \n634 \n635 \n636 \n637 \n638 \n639 \n640 \n641 \n642 \n643 \n644 \n645 \n646 \n647 \n648 \n649 \n650 \n651 \n652 \n653 \n654 \n655 \n656 \nEvidence for the second explanation comes from the common association of \nMaevarano Suite granitoids with major shear zones, which seem to be focused \nparticularly along terrane boundaries. As suggested above, the Antongil Craton may have \nhad a thicker, more viscous lithospheric root than the surrounding mobile belts, and so \nmay have behaved in a rigid fashion, leading to the development of shear zones along the \ncraton margins during collapse of the orogen (cf. Black and Li\u00e9geois, 1993). Magmas \nwere then emplaced along these shear zones.  \nIt is likely that both these possible explanations are valid, and indeed linked. \nAreas which had undergone Neoproterozoic subduction had hydrous, relatively dense \nmetasomatised SCLM that was a candidate both for delamination and for partial melting. \nIn contrast, areas that were unaffected by Neoproterozoic subduction were relatively \nrigid, with anhydrous lithospheric roots that were not highly susceptible to either \ndelamination or melting. Shear zones, which developed at the boundaries between these \ntwo types of terranes, focused the post-collisional magmas.  \n \n8. Conclusions \nThe Maevarano Suite of northern Madagascar consists largely of granitoid \nintrusions, with minor early mafic phases, which were emplaced between ca. 537 and 522 \nMa during the waning stages of the East African Orogen. Plutons of the Maevarano Suite \nare commonly associated with ductile shear zones, which may have developed during \nextensional collapse of the orogen. Distinctive geochemical features of these intrusions, \nincluding LILE enrichment, negative Nb-Ta anomalies, and LREE enrichment over \nHREE, point to a source in metasomatised sub-continental lithospheric mantle. \nMaevarano Suite plutons are situated in areas where there is evidence for Neoproterozoic \nsubduction, but absent from areas that were not reworked at that time. We therefore \npropose that the SCLM was metasomatised during Neoproterozoic subduction events and \nsubsequently melted during lithospheric delamination; areas such as the Antongil Craton \nwhose SCLM was not metasomatised, either did not delaminate, or were less susceptible \nto partial melting. The magmas were then emplaced along crustal-scale shear zones.  \n657 \n658 \n659 \n660 \n661 \n662 \n663 \n664 \n665 \n666 \n667 \n668 \n669 \n670 \n671 \n672 \n673 \n674 \n675 \n676 \n677 \n678 \n679 \n680 \n681 \n682 \n683 \n684 \n685 \nMany of the conclusions drawn from this work can be applied along the length of \nthe EAO, where similar post-collisional plutons are common. We suggest that the source \nfor most of these post-collisional magmas is likely to lie in the SCLM, and that abundant \npost-collisional plutons will be focused in areas where that SCLM was metasomatised \nthrough Proterozoic subduction.  \n \nAcknowledgments \nThe authors would like to thank the many BGS, USGS and Malagasy colleagues who \nwere involved in fieldwork in Madagascar during 2005-2007.
