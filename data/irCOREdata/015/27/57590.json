Associated with this increase in bottom friction \ncoefficient there is increased mixing in the upper part of the water column with an associated \ndecrease in the vertical temperature gradient. However this increase in mixing and decrease \nin temperature gradient in the upper part of the water column is very different from the \nconventional change in near bed temperature gradient produced by increased bottom mixing \nthat occurs in shallow sea regions as the bottom drag coefficient is increased. \n 3\n1. INTRODUCTION \n In shallow sea regions with strong tidal currents, it is well known that bed stress, \ndepending upon bottom roughness and tidal velocity, is the source of tidal turbulence in these \nareas.  Since this turbulence is generated by bed roughness it is largest at the sea bed, and \ndecreases with height above the bed.  In essence mixing in the water column is generated at \nthe bottom and diffuses up through the water column.  In addition bed stress together with \nturbulence (parameterized by vertical eddy viscosity) are the features which determine tidal \ncurrent profiles and tidal dissipation.  Also tidally induced vertical mixing in the absence of \nwind forcing determines the rate at which solar heating is diffused from the surface layer to \ndepth.  In very shallow water with strong tidal mixing the water column remains well mixed, \nwhereas in deeper water shelf sea regions a thermocline forms at depth producing a cold \nwater bottom dome (e.g. Hill 1996, Hill et al. 1994, Xing and Davies 2005, Davies and Xing \n2006). These cold water bottom domes are found in many shelf sea regions (e.g. Irish Sea and \nYellow Sea, see Hill et al. 1994, Davies and Xing (2006)) where there are rapid increases in \nwater depth and an associated decrease in tidal current amplitude and mixing. \n In shelf edge regions where both the seasonal and permanent thermocline exist, and \nthe topography is steep, then the on\/off shelf motion of the tide gives rise to internal waves, \nas density surfaces are moved over the bottom slope (e.g. Baines 1995, Lamb 2004a, Legg et \nal. 2006, Gerkema et al. 2006, Cummins (2000) and Vlasenko et al. 2005).  If the length scale \nof the topography is large compared with the tidal excursion length, then non-linear effects \nare small and an internal tide at the same frequency as the barotropic tide is produced \n(Gerkema and Zimmermann 1995).  In this case the barotropic tide loses energy to the \nbaroclinic tide, which subsequently propagates away from its generation region. \n For the case in which the topographic length scale is comparable or shorter than the \ntidal excursion then non-linear effects are particularly important and energy cascades to \n 4\nshorter wavelengths.  In a hydrostatic model this build up of energy at the short wavelength \nin the shelf break region can produce instabilities.  To stabilise these models horizontal \ndiffusion is often increased in these regions (e.g. Willmott and Edwards 1987).  If the \nhydrostatic approximation is not made (namely a non-hydrostatic model) then non-\nhydrostatic dispersion occurs and short waves (e.g. solitons, often observed at times of \nmaximum tidal flow in shelf edge regions, unsteady lee waves (Nakamura et al. 2000, 2001, \nStashuk et al. (2007), Vlasenko et al. (2002, 2005), Xing and Davies 2006, 2007, hereafter \nXD06, XD07) radiate energy from the region where non-linear effects are important.  In this \ncase energy cascades from the barotropic tide into short waves which give rise to mixing due \nto convective overturning or shear instabilities.  The role of short (in the sense of less than the \ntidal excursion) scale topography (Gerkema and Zimmerman 1995) and non-linear effects \n(Lamb 2004a) in shelf slope regions in enhancing mixing in these areas with associated \nimplications for ocean circulation is now well recognized (Samelson 1998, Spall 2001, \nSaenko 2006). In terms of oceanic mixing, calculations (Samelson 1998, Spall 2001, Saenko \n2006) have shown that on long time scales (of order 40 years) enhanced mixing in the \noceanic lateral boundary layer can influence circulation in the ocean interior which affects the \nmeridional circulation. \n Besides deep water shelf edge interactions between tides and topography in shallow \nwater regions there is significant non-linear interaction at sill regions at the entrance to fjords \n(Stiegbrandt 1999, Stiegbrandt and Aure 1989, Vlasenko et al. 2002, Cummins 2000, \nCummins et al. 2003) and lochs (Inall et al. 2004, 2005).  In these areas flow over the sill is \nsignificant (of order in excess of 1 m s P-1 P, Inall et al. 2004) and hence the tidal excursion is \nappreciable compared to sill width.  As shown in a range of measurements, analytical studies \n(e.g. Baines 1995) and numerical investigations (e.g. Vlasenko et al. 2002, XD06, Cummins \n2000, Cummins et al. 2003) this gives rise to strong lee waves on the lee side of the sill as the \n 5\ntide flows over it.  Recent measurements in Loch Etive (Inall et al. 2004, 2005) and \nmodelling using an idealized representation of a loch sill (XD06) demonstrated that these lee \nwaves are responsible for a significant transfer of barotropic tidal energy into internal motion.  \nThis energy cascade from barotropic motion to internal waves that eventually break with \nresulting mixing, leads to an increase in the mixing that occurs on the lee side of the sill as \nthe tide reverses (XD06).  The importance of unsteady lee wave generation and propagation \nupon mixing in oceanic sea mount regions was recently demonstrated by Nakamura et al. \n2000 and Nakamura and Awaji (2001).  Consequently factors such as bottom friction which \nas will be shown influence across sill velocity shear, and the extent of unsteady lee wave \ngeneration and distribution on the lee side of a sill, influence temperature distributions in sill \nregions. \n Analytical studies (e.g. Baines 1995) and numerical calculations (e.g. Vlasenko et al. \n2002, XD06) show that as the tidal flow over the sill increases, lee waves are generated on \nthe lee side of the sill.  When the tidal velocity (U) in the sill region is such that it exceeds the \nfirst mode internal wave speed CBi B, then the Froude number FBrB = U\/CBi B exceeds unity and the \nlee waves on the lee side are prevented from propagating back towards the sill and are \namplified.  When the tide reverses some of these lee waves are advected back towards the \nsill.  As discussed by Davies and Xing (2007) (hereafter DX07) in the case of Loch Etive, for \na realistic range of sill depths, vertical stratifications, and tidal forcings, unsteady lee waves \nformed on the lee side of the sill cannot propagate across the sill, and there is the potential for \nsome of their energy to go into mixing.  Consequently factors such as tidal forcing, sill width, \ndepth, as shown by XD06 which influence the energy in the lee waves will affect the extent \nto which unsteady lee wave energy is available for mixing due to wave breaking (Nakamura \net al. 2000, Nakamura and Awaji 2001).  In essence unlike in a shallow sea where bottom \nfriction produces mixing, it is the unsteady lee wave dissipation, convective overturning, \n 6\nshear instabilities and internal wave breaking that are the source of mixing in sill regions.  \nThis mixing does not come from the lateral surface or bed boundary layers but is produced \nwithin the water column.  As such it is \u201cinternal\u201d rather than \u201cexternal\u201d mixing as defined by \nVan Haren and Howarth (2004).  In view of this XD06, DX07 did not examine the role of \nbottom friction in determining the extent of unsteady lee wave generation, and hence the \nassociated implications for mixing. Here the focus is upon the role of bottom friction upon \ninternal wave mixing, in a cross section model. However in a three dimensional model it will \nalso influence horizontal eddy formation and associated mixing. \n The earlier work (XD06 DX07) was concerned exclusively with the Loch Etive \nregion, with XD06 considering the influence of small scale topography on the sill of Loch \nEtive upon lee wave generation in this region.  Subsequently this was extended to a more \ncomprehensive study of how sill topography in general influenced the spectrum of internal \nwave generation in sill regions.  To complement this work and the Loch Etive measurements, \ntogether with understanding how vertical stratification in the region of the Loch Etive sill \ninfluenced the lee wave response and flow separation downstream of the sill a detailed study \nof the role of stratification was performed (DX07).   \nIn this paper that earlier work is extended by examining to what extent bottom friction \ninfluences the intensity of lee waves in the region of a sill.  In essence the focus here is how \nbottom friction has the potential to influence mixing, not through differences in bed generated \nturbulence, but by its effect on unsteady lee waves, convective overturning and shear in the \nsill region.  Initially calculations are performed with topography representing Loch Etive to \ndetermine how sensitive previous solutions in this region were to assumptions concerning \nbottom friction coefficient.  Subsequently calculations are also performed with topography \nrepresenting an idealized symmetric sill.  In this case long term integrations are carried out to \nexamine how bottom friction influences lee waves, internal tides and longer term mixing in a \n 7\nmore general context. In essence both the short term and long term influence of bottom \nfriction upon mixing in different topographic contexts are examined. \n The non-hydrostatic model and domain setup for Loch Etive are identical to XD06 \nand are described in Section 2.  Subsequent sections deal with the influence of bottom \nfrictional effects upon lee wave magnitude and temperature distributions in the sill region for \nthe Loch Etive problem, and in the more general case, on both the shorter and longer time \nscale. A final section summarizes the main results of the study. \n2. NUMERICAL MODEL \nAs previously (XD06) calculations were performed using the MIT code which is \nbased on a z coordinate in the vertical.  As details are given in Marshall et al. 1997, and its \napplication to internal tide generation in Legg and Adcroft (2003), they will not be discussed \nhere.  The model integrates the three dimensional incompressible Bossinesq equations using \neither the hydrostatic approximation or the full non-hydrostatic equations, as applied here.  \nAs shown by XD07 it is essential to use a non-hydrostatic model to get the correct transfer of \nenergy from the barotropic to the baroclinic flow in a sill region.  Since the grid resolution \nused here is sufficiently fine to explicitly resolve the dominant mixing processes, subgrid \nscale mixing can be accurately approximated by constant values of horizontal and vertical \neddy viscosity (ABh B, ABVB), and diffusivities (KBh B, KBv B).  The implications of using a turbulence \nenergy closure scheme are briefly discussed later. \nAll calculations were performed with the model in two dimensional (x, z) cross \nsectional form, initially with idealized topography and water depths representing the sill at \nthe entrance to a Scottish Loch.  In subsequent calculations (see later) a more idealized form \nof sill, namely a symmetric sill was used to ensure that conclusions drawn from the Loch \nEtive calculations were valid for a range of sill geometry.  Also by performing longer term \ncalculations with this topography, additional analysis of the importance of bottom friction \n 8\nupon the energy cascade from the barotropic tide to the baroclinic tide, lee waves and high \nfrequency motion could be examined.   \nAlthough a cross section slice model rather than a full three dimensional model is \nused here, a cross sectional model is appropriate in the region of a sill, where the lateral walls \nof the fjord constrain the flow to be over the sill. Considering initially the Loch Etive case, \nthe sill width (of order 1000m), Loch length and water depths (of order 100m)(Fig. 1) \napproximated those of Loch Etive where recent measurements were made (Inall et al. 2004, \n2005).  As idealized topography and stratification were used no detailed comparison with \nInall et al. 2004, 2005 can be made.  However, as shown in XD06, DX07 the model can \nreproduce the train of unsteady lee waves that are found on the lee side of the sill, and the \nintensity and location of the jet that separates from the sill.  The period and wavelength of the \nlee waves were in good agreement with that given by Inall et al. (2004, 2005).  As \ncomparison with Inall et al. (2004, 2005) is given in XD06 it will not be repeated here.  In \naddition by using topography in the present calculations that is appropriate to Loch Etive the \ninfluence of bottom friction and hence bed types upon unsteady lee waves and the \ntemperature field in the sill region can be assessed.  However, to date no measurements of \nbed types on the top of the sill exist for validation purposes.  Measurements in similar \nsituations namely shallow banks in areas of strong tide flow have been made (Nash and \nMoum 2001) that suggest because of strong tidal currents, the sea bed on top of sills is very \nrough and hence there is a large drag coefficient.  By using dimensions that are typical of sills \nat the entrance to lochs and fjords the resulting conclusions are relevant to modelling loch \nand fjord regions. \nThe idealized Loch Etive topography of the region (Fig 1) is characterized by a \nconstant depth area at the left end of the domain (h = 50 m) with an open mouth at x = -6500 \nm, where MB2 B barotropic tidal forcing is applied using a Flather type radiation condition.  For \n 9\nthe baroclinic motion a flow relaxation zone is applied, with the temperature relaxed to its \ninitial value.  This is similar to the sponge layer used by Nakamura et al. (2000).  Although \nnot perfect this boundary condition is ideal in short term limited area calculations, but can \ncause some weak reflection in longer term calculations.  The sill is situated at x = 0, with a \nwater depth on top of the sill, namely hBs B = 15 m, with water depths increasing to h = 100 m \non the eastern side of the sill, which is closed at x = 15000 m.  Initial conditions consisted of \na horizontal uniform temperature field.  The same initial vertical temperature gradient was \nused in all calculations to give a buoyancy frequencies (N).  Initial conditions at time t = 0, of \nzero horizontal (u) and vertical (w) velocity were specified.  Motion was induced by \nbarotropic tidal forcing of the form \n     u = UBo B sin (\u03c9t) \nat the western open boundary, where UBo B is the specified amplitude of the tidal current, at the \nM B2B frequency \u03c9.  The Coriolis parameter f was fixed at 1.2 x 10P-4 P s P-1 P, typical of northern \nlatitude regions where fjord systems occur (Stiegbrandt (1999), Stigebrandt and Aure \n(1989)). The application of a non zero value of f, gave rise to a bottom Ekman layer, although \nthe cross sectional nature of the model meant that there was no cross channel variation in \nvelocity. A fine uniform grid resolution dz = 1 m was used in the vertical with the horizontal \ngrid gradually varying from dx = 10 m in the sill region to 100 m outside this area.  This gave \na model domain of 699 x 100 grid points and a time step dt = 2.0 s.  With such a fine grid the \ncoefficients of vertical and horizontal viscosity were set at ABVB = 10P-3 P mP2 P s P-1 P, ABh B = 10P-1 P mP2 P s P-1 P, \nwith corresponding diffusivities of KBVB = KBh B = 10P-7 P mP2 P s P-1 P.  These coefficients were identical to \nthose used in XD06, DX07 and yielded solutions for the unsteady lee wave distribution in \ngood agreement with the Loch Etive measurements.  For that reason the same values are used \nhere. \n 10\n A no heat flux boundary condition was applied at sea surface and sea bed, together \nwith a zero surface stress condition.  The form of the MIT code is such that there is a thin \nviscous boundary layer at the sea bed together with a quadratic friction law.  By setting \nviscosity at the bed to KBVB, the bed stress is in essence determined by the quadratic friction \ncoefficient k when k is non-zero.  When k is zero, the presence of the no slip condition at the \nbed, and non-zero KBVB gives a small bed stress which produces a thin viscous boundary layer \nand hence the bed shear stress which is necessary for flow separation to occur on the lee side \nof the sill (Afanasyev and Peltier 2001, Lamb 2004b).  The presence of this viscous layer and \nnon-zero KBVB together with quadratic friction leads to a reduction in velocity at the bed and a \nsheared water column above it, as found in tidal flows over sills.  By adjusting the drag \ncoefficient to simulate different bed types, the effect of bed stress and bottom shear on the \nflow and internal wave field can be examined.  The calculations are therefore very different \nfrom the inviscid calculations of Afanasyev and Peltier (2001) or Lamb (2004b) which did \nnot involve a drag law, or examine the influence of bed roughness. In essence a quadratic slip \ncondition, is used here in the bed region, rather than a no-slip condition. However as vertical \nshear through the water column, particularly in the sill region is the important parameter that \ndetermines upper water column mixing, then similar results could be obtained with a no-slip \nbottom boundary condition. \nIn the calculations described here this quadratic friction law was used at the sea bed, \nwith friction coefficient k varying from 0.0, 0.0025 to 0.025.  By this means the effect of \nbottom skin friction varying from smooth through to very rough (gravel, small rocks) \n(Soulsby 1983) upon both bottom boundary layer mixing (external mixing) and internal \nmixing due to the hydraulic transition and lee waves could be examined. \n3. NUMERICAL CALCULATIONS (Short period, Loch Etive Region) \n 11\n In an initial series of short period calculations to examine the sensitivity of the \nsolution to changes in bottom friction coefficient, the idealized Loch Etive topography (Fig. \n1) and short term time integration used by XD06 was applied.  By this means comparisons \nwith earlier results (XD06) and observations in the region (Inall et al. 2004, 2005) could be \nmade.  As observations of Inall et al. 2004, 2005 were only made on the deeper water right \nhand side of the sill, the discussion will focus on this region.  However, the physics of the \nhydraulic transition, unsteady lee wave generation, flow separation and shear induced mixing \nthat occurs during the flood stage on the right hand side of the sill, also occurs on the left \nhand side during the ebb.  In this case due to differences in water depth and sill slope their \nintensity is different although the processes generating them are the same.  For this reason \ncombined with the lack of observations and in order not to repeat arguments, in general only \nevents on the right hand side of the sill will be discussed.  As a detailed discussion of the \nphysics of the flow over the sill is given in XD06, DX07, only the main features, in particular \nthose influenced by bottom friction will be considered.  In all calculations the topography and \ninitial temperature field, giving a buoyancy frequency N = 0.01 s P-1 P, together with tidal current \namplitude UBo B = 0.3 m s P-1 P were used, although bottom friction coefficient k varied. \n In an initial calculation k = 0.0 (Calc 1), motion was started from a state of rest by \ntidal forcing through the left open boundary.  To examine the time variation of the flow and \ntemperature field model output was produced at every 1\/8 of a tidal cycle and selected output \nat this time interval is presented here.  This tidal flow gives rise to an upwelling (Fig. 2a) of \nisotherms on the left side of the sill.  As the current over the sill increases, the sill Froude \nnumber (FBs B = UBs B\/N hBs B), with hBs B sill depth and UBs B sill velocity increases and exceeds unity \nwhen UBs B exceeds 15 cm s P-1 P.  Thus the across sill velocity is super-critical for values \nexceeding 15 cm sP-1 P.  On the right hand side of the sill, the water is deeper and the flow is \nsub-critical.  As across sill flow changes from super-critical to sub-critical, the isotherms in \n 12\nthe upper part of the water column are depressed at t = 2\/8T, where T is the tidal period (Fig. \n2a).  A near vertical isotherm is evident in the near bed layer on the right hand side of the sill \nat about x = 500 m. \n The across sill velocity shows a maximum surface current of order 80 cm sP-1 P, in the \nupper 10 m of the water column, with a gradual reduction in the near bed region.  Although \nthe bed stress is small (see later discussion) it is non-zero and the flow is viscous, unlike the \ncalculations of Afanasyev and Peltier (2001).  Consequently as shown by Lamb (2004b) flow \nseparation can occur.  Although stress and viscous effects are the prime processes producing \nthe separation, as shown by Klymak and Gegg (2003) internal pressure gradients arising from \nthe vertical displacement of isotherms influence the location of the separation point, which in \nthis case occurs at a depth of about 30 m.  A narrow current jet leaves the sill at this position, \nand re-attaches at depth, with a second separation point and jet at 70 m (Fig. 2a). \n Temperature contours in the surface layer show the presence of small scale ripples \nassociated with the hydraulic jump.  In addition temperature contour vertical separation \nincreases. In essence this change in the vertical temperature gradient can occur by advection \nof water, or irreversible mixing (Peltier and Caulfield, 2003).  As shown by the inviscid direct \nnumerical simulations of Afanasyev and Peltier (2001) this can occur at about mid-water on \nthe lee side of an obstacle.  In the region where the current separates from the sill (the \nseparation point) at a depth of about 60 m the isotherms separate due to the current \u201cjet\u201d.  \nThis enhances the temperature gradient below the \u201cjet\u201d, which together with the shear \nassociated with the jet gives rise to a low Richardson number R Bi B (Fig. 3) in this region, where \nis\u03c1where,\nzzz\n\u03c1\n\u03c1\ngR\n22\ni \u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b \u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b\n\u2202\n\u2202+\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\u2212= vu density.  The presence of RBi B numbers below the \ncritical value of 0.25 indicates a region where intense mixing can occur.  Obviously the \nintensity of the mixing in a numerical model will depend upon the parameterization of the \n 13\ndiffusion.  In the present model a small constant diffusion coefficient was used and hence \nmixing was reduced (see later).  However as shown by Cummins (2000) in the POM \nhydrostatic ocean model where a Mellor and Yamada turbulence scheme was used, with a \nRichardson number dependent diffusion, the mixing can be large. Since the present model is \nnon-hydrostatic, then density inversion can occur, giving rise to regions of negative RBi B \nnumber (Fig. 3) \n At t = 4\/8T, half-way through the tidal cycle, the across sill barotropic velocity is near \nzero.  However there is a small current jet on the right side of the sill (Fig. 2b).  Within this \njet is a flow to the right (+ve u velocity) with a region of negative u velocity above and below \nit.  Associated with these flows is a downwelling of the temperature surfaces on the lee side \nof the sill in the upper part of the water column (Fig. 2b).  At this time the intensity of the jet \nhas increased as has the separation of the isotherms along the sill slope at about z = -60 m.  \nThis is in part due to advection into the region although at this time the current outside the jet \nis small.  In addition mixing in the region (see later) can contribute to the widening of the \nisotherms at depth. \n At t = 8\/8T (Fig. 2c) namely the end of the first tidal cycle the flow over the sill and \non its right hand side is near zero.  At this time there is no midwater jet, although there is \nsome separation of the isotherms at z = -60 m.  This separation occurs despite the absence of \nan appreciable flow, suggesting that mixing has taken place at this depth. \n As the bottom friction coefficient is increased from k = 0.0 to 0.0025 to 0.025 the \nhorizontal and vertical extent of the region of appreciable vertical displacements of the \nisotherms from their initial position is increased on the lee side of the sill (Fig. 2a).  The \nposition of the hydraulic transition at x = 1000 m (t = 2\/8T, k = 0.0025 (Fig. 2a)) moves \nfarther downstream to about x = 1300 m (t = 2\/8T, k = 0.025, Fig. 2a).  In addition there is an \nincrease in the small scale vertical displacements of the isotherms between the sill top and the \n 14\nlocation of the hydraulic transition.  The space (of order 100m) and time scale (of order 10 \nmins) of these small scale waves suggests (see DX06, XD07 for more details) that they are \nunsteady lee waves formed on the downstream side of the sill.  The formation of unsteady lee \nwaves over steep topography such as that used here has been reported by Vlasenko et al. \n2002, 2005, Stashchuk et al. 2007, Nakamura et al. 2000, 2001.  This appears to be the \nprimary cause of these waves which were also observed by Inall et al. (2004, 2005) on the lee \nside of Loch Etive.  It is apparent from Figs. 2a,b that the intensity and spatial distribution of \nthe temperature signal associated with the lee waves is significantly influenced by the value \nof k.  In addition the strength of the current jet that separates from the downstream side of the \nsill at t = 4\/8T at about x = 500 m is also influenced by the choice of k. The value of k also \ninfluences where this jet separates from the sill and its downstream distribution (Fig. 2b). \nEven at slack water t = 8\/8T when the current is small the isotherm distribution at mid-water \n(Fig. 2c) has been influenced by the choice of k, suggesting that k has affected mid-water \nmixing (see later).  A very different situation than in a shallow sea, where k influences \nbottom mixing. \n To determine the reason for this it is valuable to examine how k influences the across \nsill flow.  Time series of u current from x = 0 (crest of the sill) (Fig. 4a), for the second tidal \ncycle, shows flood tide (flow to the right) occurring at t = 1.25T, with slack water at t = 1.5T, \nand ebb-flow following this.  As k = 0.0, and viscosity in the bottom boundary layer is small \nthere is no evidence of significant shear in the bottom boundary layer during the tidal cycle. \n Increasing the friction coefficient to k = 0.0025, a typical shallow sea value, \ncorresponding to a sandy sea bed, leads to enhanced shear in the bottom boundary layer of \nthe across sill velocity (Fig. 4b).  A further increase to k = 0.025, the friction coefficient \nassociated with large gravel or small boulders leads to enhanced shear in the near bed region \n(Fig. 4c).  Although increasing k, leads to a reduction in near bed current and increase in \n 15\nshear in the near bed region, depth mean current across the sill remain unchanged and hence \nthe sill Froude number (FBs B = U\/hN) based on the initial N value remains constant in all \ncalculations.  On the lee side of the sill, this enhanced vertical shear in the flow increases \nconvective overturning and associated breaking in the region of the hydraulic transition \nleading to enhanced vertical mixing (see later) on the lee side of the sill (Fig. 2a, t = 2\/8T).  \nAssociated with this enhanced mixing is a reduction in N close to the top of the lee side of the \nsill.  As shown by XD07, a local reduction in N in the region of the sill top leads to an \nenhancement in unsteady lee wave generation.  Consequently unsteady lee waves can be \nreadily generated in this region and are advected downstream (Fig. 2a).  The presence of lee \nwaves gives rise to the regions of enhanced u surface current as shown in Fig. 2a (k = 0.0025 \nand 0.025), and found in observations in Loch Etive (Inall et al. 2004, 2005).  The convective \noverturning cells in the upper part of the water column give rise to low RBi B numbers (Fig. 3, k \n= 0.0025 and 0.025) and enhanced surface mixing (see later).  This is different to previously \n(k = 0.0) (Fig. 3) where shear at depth was the main source of mixing. \n The change in the intensity of the unsteady lee waves and associated short waves on \nthe downstream side of the sill at x = 500 m can be quantified in terms of time series over a \ntidal cycle of horizontal (u) and vertical (w) components of current associated with them (Fig. \n5).  Comparing time series of w shows (Fig. 5), that during flood tide, i.e. the first half of the \ntidal cycle, the magnitude and duration of the unsteady lee waves increases as k increases \nwith an appreciable difference between k = 0 and k = 0.0025.  As shown by DX07 the \ngeneration and intensity of unsteady lee waves is significantly influenced by the value of N \nnear the sill crest on the downstream side of the sill.  The fact that the lee wave signal has \nincreased with increasing k, suggests that mixing has occurred on the lee side of the sill.  This \nwill be examined in terms of changes in N and discussed later. In addition changes in N due \nto mixing influence the frequency of the lee waves (XD07) Associated with the vertical \n 16\nvelocity due to the unsteady lee waves, are time variations of the u current which enhance or \ndetract from the background tidal velocity giving rise to short period increases or decreases in \nu velocity during the flood stage of the tide. The nature of the mixed tidal-lee wave formed \non the lee side of the sill, is that of a wave that is arrested at peak flood, that then propagates \nback toward the sill as tidal velocity decreases, with mixed tidal lee waves propagating out of \nthe generation region (Nakamura et al 2000, Nakamura and Awaji 2001). \n To examine how the energy transfer from the barotropic tide to the baroclinic tide, \nunsteady lee waves and other high frequency waves is influenced by the value of k, depth \nintegrated power spectral density of the vertical velocity (see Legg and Huijts (2006), for \ndetails) were computed over the first two tidal cycles at x = 1000 m (Fig. 6).  For the case of \nk = 0, there is more power in the low frequency (M B2B tide and its higher frequencies) end of \nthe spectrum than in the high frequency end.  However, for k = 0.025, the power in the \ninternal tide in particular the higher harmonics is reduced, with a peak at about 70 to 80 times \nthat of the M B2B tide, namely a period of 10 mins, corresponding to the unsteady lee wave \nperiod for the stratification used here (DX07).  Short waves of this period on the lee side of \nLoch Etive were observed by Inall et al. (2004, 2005).  For k = 0.0025 the spectrum (not \nshown) had a reduced tidal but increased high frequency power compared to k = 0.  These \npower spectra clearly show that the distribution of baroclinic energy, during the first two tidal \ncycles between internal tides and high frequency short waves is influenced by the value of k. \n To quantify the extent to which changes in k influence the mixing on the lee side of \nthe sill, it is necessary to remove the contribution to the displacement of the isotherms by \nadvection into a region.  As shown by Legg and Huijts (2006) because of flow through the \nopen boundary into the region it is difficult to perform an instantaneous budget for \ntemperature advection.    In addition because of isotherm overturning it is not possible to \nfollow isotherms and accurately compute the volume change between them due to advection.  \n 17\nHowever, since it is the longer term change in stratification due to mixing that is important, \nand in a tidal flow the advective motion is sinusoidal, then the change in temperature due to \nirreversible mixing over a tidal cycle can be obtained by averaging the temperature field over \na tidal cycle. \n Contours of the tidally averaged (over the 3Prd P tidal cycle) temperature and density \nanomaly given as the difference between the tidally averaged buoyancy frequency (NP2 P) and \nits initial value ( )2ON  on the right hand side of the sill (in the region of the sill) are given in \nFig. 7. In order to ensure that advection in the area of the open boundary does not influence \nthe solution, it is important (as here) to ensure that the region of interest is well removed from \nthe open boundary. Comparing temperature contours with their initial values (Fig. 1), and the \nchange in NP2 P, it is apparent that for k = 0 mid-water mixing has occurred on the lee side of \nthe sill, with little change in the surface layer.  The effect of the increase in mid-water mixing \nhas been to slightly increase the stratification in the lower layer.  As k is increased the extent \nof the region of mid-water mixing increases with some mixing occurring in the surface layer.  \nAs shown in DX07, changes in stratification on the upper half of the slope and in the surface \nlayer on the lee side of a sill influence the magnitude and frequency of unsteady lee wave \ngeneration.  This explains the differences in the lee waves found for various k values. Just \nhow changes in the value of k influence mixing in the sill region and hence the spectrum of \ninternal waves is difficult to determine. It is however clear from the calculations, that changes \nin k influence both the vertical shear and the internal jet, which affects mixing with \nassociated changes in the internal wave field. It is evident from Figs. 7a,b that although there \nhas been some change in stratification in the nearbed region due to bottom boundary layer \nmixing this is confined to the very near bed region and does not directly influence the mid-\nwater mixing.  This is very different than in a shallow sea region where bottom mixing \ndetermines mixing throughout the water column. \n 18\n As time progresses mixing continues downstream of the sill (compare Figs. 7a and 7b \n(averaged over 4Pth P tidal cycle)). In the case of k = 0, on this longer time scale there is some \nincrease in mixing in the surface layer, with the region of mid-water mixing expanding \nslightly.  A comparable expansion of the region of mid-water mixing occurs with k = 0.0025 \n(not shown) and k = 0.025. \n The longer term effect of the mid-water mixing is to reduce the vertical and horizontal \ntemperature gradient in the upper part of the water column in the region of the sill for all \nvalues of k.  This suggests that without a river inflow from the upper part of the loch to \nmaintain stratification in the sill region, as mixing occurs close to the sill, the distribution of \nenergy between the internal tide and unsteady lee waves will change, as the stratification in \nthe sill region evolves. \n This change in energy can be quantified in terms of differences in power spectra \nbased on the first two tidal cycles (Fig. 6) and second two tidal cycles (Fig. 8) at x = 1000 m, \nfor k = 0.0 and 0.025.  It is evident for k = 0.0, that the MB2 B internal tidal energy peak has \nincreased, as has the energy at the unsteady lee wave period, with a decrease at the higher \nharmonics of the tide, between the third (Fig. 6) and fourth (Fig. 8) tidal cycle.  For k = 0.025 \nthere has been a small change in the low frequency end of the spectrum, with a reduction and \nbroadening of the spectrum at the high frequency end. \n These calculations suggest that although increasing k, as in a shallow sea region, leads \nto a small enhancement in bottom mixing this process has little or no effect upon internal \nmixing downstream from a sill.  However, increasing k enhances the magnitude of the \nvertical shear in the near bed region of the flow over the sill, although its depth mean values \nand hence the sill Froude number are not affected by this change in k.  This enhanced vertical \nshear in the flow increases convective overturning and associated breaking in the hydraulic \ntransition region on the lee side of the sill.  This leads to enhanced mixing on the lee side of \n 19\nthe sill near its top.  As shown in DX07 increased mixing in this region, with an associated \nreduction in N, enhances unsteady lee wave generation. As this has been investigated in \ngeneral in terms of the Froude number (see DX07, and references therein) it will not be \nelaborated here. In a tidal flow these unsteady lee waves are trapped on the lee side of the sill \nand amplified (XD06).  When the tide reverses they can propagate towards the sill although \nas shown in XD06, DX07, for the sill heights considered here they do not propagate over the \nsill.  Consequently they can enhance mixing on the lee side of the sill due to non-linear wave-\nwave interaction (Nakamura et al. 2000, 2001).  Other forms of internal wave generated in \nthe sill region e.g. internal tides, solitons etc. can propagate out of the region and in nature are \nresponsible for mixing elsewhere.   \n As shown here changes in stratification in the sill region affects the partitioning of \nenergy between the low frequency (baroclinic) part of the spectrum and the higher frequency \npart.  In the absence of a river inflow to maintain stratification in the sill area, the region of \nmid-water mixing continues to grow.  Although, even in a model, it is difficult to separate \ntemperature changes due to diffusion from those due to advection, it is clear that the changes \nin internal wave energy spectrum from one tidal cycle to another, reflect changes in the \ndensity field due to mixing.  On the longer term, in the case of k = 0.0, mixing in the upper \npart of the water column increases the lee wave energy in this region (not shown).  However, \nfor other k values the upper part of the water column becomes well mixed and the lee waves \nare mainly confined to the lower part of the water column.  This shows that besides the lee \nwave generation and intensity of mixing depending upon the value of k, it is also influenced \nby time scale.  To examine to what extent sill width and longer term mixing affects the role \nof bottom friction coefficient these calculations were repeated with a narrow sill. \n4. NUMERICAL CALCULATIONS (longer period integration to a near steady state \nwith a symmetric sill) \n 20\n4.1 A narrow sill (N = 1.0 x 10P-2 P s P-1 P, hBs B = 15 and 45 m) \n In the previous calculations to be consistent with XD06, DX07, the sill topography \nwas chosen to represent that of Loch Etive.  In this section a symmetric narrow sill (Fig. 9), \nwith sill half width aBs B initially taken as a third of that used previously and subsequently a \nwider sill were considered.  In addition in order to examine the long term effects of mixing in \nthe sill region the calculation was performed for eight tidal cycles to reach a near steady state.   \nThese longer term integrations with a narrow sill are essential to ensure that \nconclusions from the previous calculations are not specific to Loch Etive topography. Also by \nperforming longer term integrations with symmetric sills of varying hBs,B and sill width it is \npossible to examine additional physics such as form drag and power conversion that were not \npreviously considered. As discussed previously since mixing in the sill region changes not \nonly with the value of k, but also with time, and this influences lee wave generation which in \nturn affects mixing, it is important to examine long term solutions after identical integration \nperiods.  In such a long term calculation, in order to avoid false reflections from the lateral \nboundaries affecting mixing in the sill region, the domain was extended to x = \u00b1 80km.  The \nsill was located at x = 0, with water depth at the sill (hBs B) set at 15 m.  Beyond the sill region \nwater depth was fixed at h = 100 m.  Initial conditions were as in the Loch Etive calculations.  \nIn order to ensure that open boundary conditions did not influence the solution in the sill \nregion the tide was applied as a body force in the momentum equation.  Such forcing is \nappropriate in the present calculation since open boundaries are applied at each end of the \ndomain and a symmetric sill is considered. The objective here was to examine response of \ninternal waves and mixing to various parameters, e.g., N, h Bs,B a Bs B and k. \nAs the time history of the flow field is different to that described previously, the \nchange in the velocity and temperature field as k is increased will be examined by comparing \ntemperature and flow fields at the end of the first cycle (namely t = 8\/8T) when the flow is a \n 21\nmaximum.  This is comparable to t = 2\/8T in the previous Loch Etive calculations.  However, \nas the objective is to examine mixing on the lee side of the sill for various values of k, this \ndifference in tidal forcing is not important. \n From Fig. 10a, it is apparent that there has been an appreciable change in the surface \nlayer temperature field compared to the initial conditions, extending downstream as far as x = \n700 m.  As previously (Fig. 2a) the region of non-zero current velocity is restricted to the \nupper part of the water column  Contours of vertical velocity (not presented) show unsteady \nlee waves extending downstream from the sill.  Richardson number contours (Fig. 11a) reveal \na region of critical Richardson number, namely RBi B < 0.25, where there is the potential for \nextensive mixing down stream of the sill.  On the longer time scale, namely after seven tidal \ncycles, there is a substantial change in the distribution of surface isotherms, suggesting that \nmixing could have taken place in the upper part of the water column (Fig. 10b) on the lee side \nof the sill.  Differences in the time averaged (over an MB2B tidal cycle) of the temperature and \nbuoyancy frequency (not presented) compared with the initial ones shows a region of \nincreased mixing above mid-water.  On this longer time scale there is an appreciable \nunsteady lee wave signal in the upper part of the water column, and a significant vertical \ndisplacement of the isotherms on a space scale typical of lee waves. \n As in the Loch Etive calculation, increasing the bottom friction coefficient to k = \n0.025 changes the spatial distribution of the velocity and temperature field on the downstream \nside of the sill compared to k = 0.0 (Fig. 10b).  Part of this is due to the fact that the \nmaximum across sill velocity which occurs at the surface has slightly increased giving rise to \nincreased downstream advection of the surface layer.  In the case of k = 0.025, the region of \nconvective overturning and appreciable unsteady lee wave activity extends farther \ndownstream.  In addition there is an increase in the vertical velocity (not presented) \nassociated with the unsteady lee waves.  This increase in unsteady lee wave activity with \n 22\nincrease in k is consistent with the results using the Loch Etive topography and leads to a \nmodification of the region where RBi B < 0.25 compared to the k = 0.0 solution (Fig. 11b). \n The temperature distribution after seven tidal cycles (Fig. 11b) and the tidally \naveraged difference in temperature and buoyancy frequency (not presented) shows results \nconsistent with those found in the Loch Etive case.  Namely that increasing k, enhances \nmixing in the surface layer, with the downstream extent of this mixing increasing with \nincreasing k.  In addition on this longer time scale the vertical displacement of isotherms in \nthe near bed region is reduced compared to that found with k = 0.0 (compare k = 0.0 and \n0.025 temperature contours in Fig. 11b).  Results using an intermediate k value, namely k = \n0.0025 (not shown) were consistent with this and with the Loch Etive calculations.  In \nessence in both the wide (Loch Etive) and narrow sill case increasing k enhances the \ndownstream internal mixing. \n To quantify the extent to which changes in k in the narrow sill case modify the \nfrequency distribution of internal wave energy, power spectra at x = 1000 m for k = 0 and k = \n0.025 were computed (Fig. 12).  Comparing these spectra shows that in both cases there is a \nsignificant spectral peak at frequencies corresponding to unsteady lee waves.  In addition this \nspectral peak is sharper than found in the Loch Etive calculation (compare Figs. 12 and 8) \nsuggesting that as the sill narrows more power is transferred to unsteady lee waves for all \nvalues of k.  However in the case of low k values there are peaks at the fundamental and \nhigher harmonics of the tide, whereas at higher k values (e.g. k = 0.025) there is more of a \ncontinuum at low frequencies (Fig. 12). \n In order to quantify the bottom friction effects on internal waves we compute internal \nmotion induced form drag (FBDB) and barotropic to baroclinic power conversion rate (R) in the \nregion D extending to x = \u00b1  500 m (1500 m for a wide sill, see next section) on either side of \nthe sill. The form drag can be written as  \n 23\ndx\ndx\ndhP\nD\n1F bD \u222b= D  \nFBDB is the force per unit area caused by internal wave induced horizontal pressure differences \nacting on opposite sides of the sill, with PBb B the bottom pressure.  Similarly the power \nconversion rate R can be obtained, as in Legg and Huijts (2006), from   \ndx\ndx\ndhPU\nD\n1R bbt\u222b= D  \nwith PBbB given by \n( ) ( )t,zx,P\u03b6\u03b6g\u03c1P btob b\u2032+\u2212=  \nwhere \u03b6 is the free surface elevation, \u03b6Bbt B is the free surface elevation in a parallel barotropic \ncalculation and P\u2032 (x, zBb B, t) is the fluctuating part of the bottom pressure field due to internal \nwaves.  In a non-hydrostatic calculation this accounts for pressure variations from both \nhydrostatic and non-hydrostatic processes.  \n Table 1 shows the time averaged (over an MB2 Btidal cycle at the end of the model run) \npower conversion rate (R) for various model runs. It is evident that as k increases R decreases \nfor all the cases. The main reason for this is due to the reduced vertical stratification as k \nincreases. Another interesting feature is that R is much larger for the case of hBs B = 45m (a \nrelatively deeper sill) than that of hBs B = 15m, which is in contrast with recent work of small \namplitude topography in the deep sea environment (Khatiwala 2003, Legg and Huijts 2006). \nThe mechanism for this is out side the scope of the present paper. \n4.2 A wide sill (N = 1.0 x 10P-2 P s P-1 P, hBs B = 15 m) \n In order to determine how sill width influences the response to changing k, the \nprevious series of calculations were repeated with aBs B three times larger than the narrow sill \ncalculation and k varying from low (k = 0.00125) to high (k = 0.125) (for some numerical \n 24\nreasons the model is not stable with k = 0 for this topography) .  The model domain, water \ndepth, stratification and forcing were as before. \n As previously for the narrow sill case (Fig. 10a) at t = 8\/8T, the effect of increasing k, \nis to increase the downstream extent of the region of unsteady lee wave activity and \nassociated convective overturning and mixing in the surface layer (Fig. 13a).  Comparison of \nFigs. 10a and 13a, suggests that unsteady lee wave generation has been reduced by the \ndecrease in sill aspect ratio as to be expected.  Comparison of Richardson number contours \n(Fig. 14a) for k = 0.00125 and 0.025 as in the narrow sill case show that the region of critical \nRichardson number (RBi B < 0.25) is significantly larger and closer to the surface for the higher k \nvalue. \n As in the narrow sill case, on the longer time scale, namely after seven tidal cycles, \ntemperature contours suggest that there is appreciably more mixing in the surface layer in the \nsolution computed with the higher k value (Fig. 13b).  This was confirmed as in the narrow \nsill case by differences in the time averaged temperature and buoyancy frequency (not \npresented).  Similarly on this longer time scale the region of critical RBi B number on the lee side \nof the sill computed with k = 0.025 is larger than that determined with the small k value. \n To determine to what extent the change in sill width, and value of k influences the \ninternal wave power density spectrum it was determined as previously (Fig. 12), at x = 1000 \nm for both values of k (Fig. 15).  From a comparison of Figs. 12 and 15, it is evident that \nincreasing the sill width has reduced the intensity of the spectral peak in the lee wave \nfrequency band (Fig. 15) compared to previously (Fig. 12).  However, as k is increased the \npower in the lee wave band is increased.  These changes are consistent with those found for \nthe Loch Etive and narrow sill calculations. These results, namely that increasing k, enhances \nthe downstream extent of the region of mixing in the upper part of the water column are \n 25\nconsistent with those found in the narrow sill case and the calculations using idealized Loch \nEtive topography. \n Time series over a tidal cycle at the end of the model run of form drag and power \nconversion rate show (Fig. 16) that as k is increased both form drag and power conversion \nrate decrease due to increasing energy going into mixing with a reduction of that available for \nbaroclinic wave generation.  This is consistent with the results based upon instantaneous and \ntime averaged temperature and buoyancy comparisons, and power spectra plots.  \n4.3 A wide sill (N = 1.25 x 10P-2 P s P-1 P, hBs B = 15 m) \n To determine if the previous conclusions are valid when the stratification is changed, \nthe calculations were repeated with N = 1.25 x 10P-2 P s P-1 P.  Results are illustrated in terms of \nvelocity and temperature fields at t = 56\/8T and associated form drag and power conversion \nfactor which indicates energy transfer from barotropic to baroclinic waves. Although \nincreasing the vertical stratification for a given k tends to decrease the vertical mixing \n(compare Figs. 17 and 13b), it is apparent from Fig. 17 that mixing is increased as k is \nincreased.  Similarly, although the form drag and power conversion are increased by the \nincrease in N (compare Figs. 16 and 18) (see also Table 1), these are reduced as k increases \nwhich is consistent with results from the earlier calculations. \n4.4 A wide sill (N = 1.0 x 10P-2 P s P-1 P, hBs B = 45 m) \n To determine if the previous conclusions in particular that the power conversion rate \ndecreases as k increases, are valid in the case of a deeper sill, the earlier calculation was \nrepeated with hBs B increased to 45 m.  Values of the tidally averaged conversion rate for the \nwide sill for a range of N and hBs B values are given in Table 1 for three k values.  From this \ntable it is evident that even when N and hBs B are increased, in all cases the power conversion \n 26\nrate is reduced as k is increased.  This confirms as in the initial idealized calculation using \nLoch Etive topography that upper water column mixing and the conversion of barotropic \nenergy to baroclinic is influenced by the value of k. \n5. CONCLUDING REMARKS \n A non-hydrostatic model in cross sectional form has been used to examine the \ninfluence of bottom friction coefficient upon internal waves and \u201cinternal mixing\u201d of tidal \norigin on the lee side of a sill.  The work extends previous calculations, which showed that \nsmall scale topography on the lee side of the sill enhanced mixing (XD06).  In addition it \ncomplements recent calculations (DX07) that showed that a reduction in buoyancy frequency \non the lee side of a sill close to its top enhanced lee wave production with an associated \nincrease in mixing down stream of the sill.  This modelling work gives some insight into the \nprocesses that determine the enhanced mixing on the lee side of sills found in recent \nmeasurement campaigns (Farmer and Freeland 1983, Inall et al. 2004, 2005, Klymak and \nGregg 2001, 2004, Nash and Moum 2001). \n Initial calculations using topography representing Loch Etive, with the bottom friction \ncoefficient k = 0.0, showed that downwelling occurred on the lee side of the sill, in response \nto across sill tidal flow.  On the short time scale, of order a few hours, an hydraulic transition \nformed on the lee side of the sill, with associated convective overturning, wave breaking and \nmixing down stream of the sill.  A current jet detached from the sill slope at depth, giving rise \nto shear and some mid-water mixing. As k was increased the across sill flow showed an \nincrease in shear in the bottom boundary typical of a shallow sea region.  However, the \nvertical extent of this sheared Ekman layer was confined to the near bed layer due to the \nsmall value of ABv B used in the calculations. \n The change in current shear in the vertical due to increasing k gave rise to a sharper \nhydraulic transition and enhanced (compared to k = 0.0) convective mixing downstream of \n 27\nthe sill.  This enhanced convective mixing lead to a reduction in buoyancy on the lee side of \nthe top of the sill.  This had the effect of increasing the local Froude number on the lee side of \nthe sill giving rise to increased unsteady lee wave and other short wave intensity on the \ndownstream side of the sill.  As discussed in DX07, these unsteady lee waves are trapped and \namplified during the flood stage of the tide.  During ebb they propagate back towards the sill \nwhere they enhance the mixing.  Consequently the increase in unsteady lee wave amplitude \nand subsequent mixing, resulting from an increase in k leads to a cumulative increase in \nmixing.  Other internal waves namely internal tides and mixed tidal-lee waves (Nakamura \nand Awaji (2001)) are not trapped and can propagate out of the region. \n As k increases a frictional bottom boundary layer develops on the upper lee side of \nthe sill associated with the current jet.  However, below the position where the jet separates \nfrom the sill, and away from the sill the current is near zero and there is no bottom friction \ngenerated turbulence. \n Calculations using a narrow symmetric sill, with the tide applied as a body force, \nshow identical features as k is increased.  In the case of a narrow sill, as discussed in XD07, \nstronger lee waves are generated than for a wide sill.  A similar result was found here where \nfor a given k lee waves from the narrow sill were stronger than those from the Loch Etive \ntopography.  On the short time scale namely first tidal period with a wide sill (e.g. Loch \nEtive) with k = 0.0, there is little or no unsteady lee waves, although with increased k lee \nwaves are present.  On the longer time scale, even with k = 0.0 unsteady lee waves are \ngenerated, and the intensity of these lee waves increases as sill width decreases. \n Subsequent calculations performed with a wider symmetric sill, and a range of \nbuoyancy frequencies N and sill depths hBs B, showed that sill width, depth and buoyancy \nfrequency influenced the mixing and power conversion to baroclinic motion.  However, \ndespite these changes calculations confirmed that independently of sill width and values of N \n 28\nand h Bs B, mixing on the lee side of a sill increases as k increases.  This is not due to bottom \nboundary layer turbulence as in a shallow sea region, but is due to the influence of k at the sill \ntop upon the current profile in this region.  As k is increased the vertical shear in across sill \ncurrent increases giving rise to an increase in convective mixing and lee wave formation on \nthe lee side of the sill, leading to a cumulative increase in mixing. \n This suggests that not only do small scale topographic features on the upper part of \nthe sill slope affect downstream mixing (XD06), but the roughness length and hence friction \ncoefficient associated with the bed types (sand, gravel, rocks) will also influence the \ndownstream mixing.  Consequently measurement of bed types and small scale topography \nneed to be made in sill regions.  The fact that the downstream \u201cinternal mixing\u201d persists for a \nlong time and extends well beyond the topographic feature generating it explains the \nobservations of mid-water mixing (Van Haren and Howarth 2004) often found in turbulence \nmeasurements in stratified regions, where the tidal bottom boundary layer is well below the \nobserved feature. \n Although the calculations performed here, were in terms of a cross sectional slice \nmodel, and therefore restricted to flows across sills where the flow is essentially normal to the \nsill, they will be appropriate in such a range of problems. However, in terms of full three-\ndimensional flow, there is the possibility of generating horizontal vortices which will increase \nthe mixing above that found here. Such a study is beyond the scope of this paper, although \nthe role of bottom friction upon vertical mixing should be comparable to that found here. \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n The authors are indebted to Mrs L Parry and E.
