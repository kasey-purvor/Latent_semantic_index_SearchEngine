Experiments on a small cluster of bubbles in a nominally two-dimensional foam show an insta-\nbility in which a topological change forces one of the bubbles to be ejected to the outside of the cluster at\na point where this is not predicted by a two-dimensional model of a foam. This is interpreted in terms of\nthe energy of the initial and ejected states and of the finite liquid content of the experimental system.

This is demonstrated experimentally with reference\nto small clusters of bubbles undergoing a single topological change.\nPACS. 82.70.Rr Aerosols and foams \u2013 46.32.+x Static buckling and instability\n1 Introduction\nBefore tackling a three-dimensional (3D) problem, one of-\nten tries first to find a two-dimensional (2D) model which\nshares some of the properties of the full system and is\nmore amenable to analysis. This is particularly true in the\nfield of foams [1]. While three-dimensional foams are more\nfamiliar from everyday experience, much can be learned\nfrom the two-dimensional soap froth. The froth is, like\nits three-dimensional counterpart, a minimal surface and\nit has both elastic and yielding properties when stressed.\nThere are also analogies with many other physical sys-\ntems, such as metallic grain growth and the territories of\nnesting birds [2]. For both the experimentalist and the the-\norist, the 2D froth is a much easier system with which to\nwork. In particular, these 2D systems are currently enjoy-\ning something of a renaissance in the field of rheology [3,4].\nThe 2D foam is also an ideal system in which to study\nsurface-tension\u2013dominated instabilities. The usual analy-\nsis of most such instabilities relies on the approximation\nof two-dimensionality (depending on, among other things,\nthe assumption that the distance between the two surfaces\nconfining the system is small compared with a length-scale\nof the system such as the bubble diameter). The system is\nalso assumed to be dry, i.e. having a low liquid fraction.\nRecently, Weaire et al. [5,6] introduced a class of\n\u201cflower\u201d bubble clusters (see Fig. 1(a)), small groups of\nbubbles that were shown to have many interesting prop-\nerties. The study of those properties is continued here,\na e-mail: simon.cox@tcd.ie\nintroducing the experimental realization and subsequent\nanalysis. Weaire et al. [5] describe a buckling instability, in\nwhich a 2D cluster of bubbles can show one of many differ-\nent equilibrated structures for given topology and (fixed)\nbubble areas. The occurrence of this instability was con-\nfirmed by numerical simulations, and provides an inter-\nesting application of the Hessian eigenvalue facility of the\nSurface Evolver [7,8].\nThe cluster consists of a ring of n bubbles (petals)\nof area A surrounding a central bubble whose area Ac is\nvaried. The cluster becomes unstable to buckling below a\ncritical value of the central area given approximately by\nequation (2) of reference [5]\nA\u2217c\/A \u2248 0.041(n\u2212 6)2. (1)\nTherefore, the buckling occurs only for clusters with more\nthan 6 petals. At this point the pressure in the central\nbubble is equal to the pressure external to the cluster and\nthe cluster becomes \u201cfloppy\u201d. That is, it can exhibit any\none of various modes of distortion, including those shown\nin Figure 1(b)-(e), without any variation in energy (equiv-\nalent to line-length in 2D).\nIn the next section we offer some further interpreta-\ntion of the 2D buckling instability as background to the\ndescription of the topological instability that follows.\n2 The buckling instability\nAt the critical point for buckling, each petal has two\nstraight sides and two sides which are arcs of the same\n30 The European Physical Journal E\n(a) (b) (c)\n(d) (e) (f)\nFig. 1.

(f) A ten-petal cluster in which one bubble has been ejected after a single\ntopological change.\ncircle [8,9]. The centre of each bubble is therefore well de-\nfined, so that we can idealize the cluster as a set of points\nconnected by freely hinged rods of fixed length. In the case\nwhere all the petals are of equal size this corresponds to a\nregular polygon with n sides, but note that this constraint\nis no longer necessary, and the petals can have arbitrary\nareas. We now ask: how can this chain buckle while con-\nserving the area inside it?\nFor fixed central area less than or equal to a critical\nvalue A\u2217c , we now calculate the degrees of freedom. There\nare 2n vertex coordinates, less n constraints for the fixed\nrod-lengths, less three constraints for the possible transla-\ntions or a rotation which we exclude. There just remains\nthe area constraint. At the critical point itself, the fixed\narea of the central bubble is linearly dependent on the\nrod-lengths. This shows that there should be n\u2212 3 modes\nof distortion, which correspond to the n \u2212 3 decreasing\neigenvalues found in Surface Evolver simulations [5]. For\nareas less than the critical one, there are therefore n \u2212 4\nmodes that remain zero, and one increasing eigenvalue cor-\nresponding to the mode of distortion, shown in Figure 2.\nWhen the area of the central bubble decreases below\nthe critical area, the energy landscape therefore contains\nmultiple, but energetically equal, minima. The modes of\ndistortion correspond to the central bubble assuming a\nshape that relates to the possible modes of buckling of a\nfreely hinged rod. For small numbers of petals, they will be\nelliptical modes; then as the number of petals increases,\ntriangular modes of distortion are allowed, followed by\nsquare modes, etc. In general, the distortion will be com-\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.5 0.55 0.6 0.65 0.7 0.75 0.8 0.85 0.9 0.95 1\nEi\nge\nnv\nal\nue\nCentral area\n3\n2\n2\n2\n1\nFig. 2.

(See also Fig. 6 for the\ninterpretation of these pictures.)\nreduction in the area of the central bubble is pursued be-\nyond the buckling instability.\nIn the idealized dry foam, one of the internal edges\nwould shrink until its length is zero, initiating a T1\n\u201cneighbour-switching\u201d transformation. This change in\ntopology reduces the energy by ejecting a bubble to the\noutside of the cluster to give a configuration such as the\none shown in Figure 1(f).\nIn studying a flower cluster experimentally, we are pre-\nvented from observing the buckling instability because it\nis pre-empted by this topological change. This ejection in-\nstability turns out to be of interest in its own right. We\nwill argue that it is due to the finite liquid content and\nthe three-dimensional nature of the experimental system.\nWe have performed experiments, described in Sec-\ntion 4, which give the critical area of the central bubble\nat which the ejection occurs. In Section 5 we calculate the\nvalue of central area at which the energy of the ejected\nstate is lower than the symmetric one. It turns out that\nthe experimental results lie precisely along this line, which\nwe attribute to the influence of the underlying liquid in the\ntype of 2D system used here (identical to that described\nin [10]). That is, the presence of the liquid allows the topo-\nlogical changes to occur when the relevant internal edges\nstill have non-zero length.\nSince the natural explanation of this is in terms of\n3D effects, we describe the various experimental systems\nthat have been used for the study of 2D foams in Sec-\ntion 6, and indicate the precise distribution of liquid in\neach of them. In future it may be necessary to carefully\ndistinguish between them. Before concluding, we describe\nfurther experiments in Section 7 which show that the topo-\nlogical changes occur independently of the length-scale of\nthe system.\n4 Experiments\nThe experimental apparatus consists of a liquid reservoir\ncontaining water and a small amount of surfactant. A glass\nplate is held over the reservoir, leaving a gap of approx-\nimately h = 3 mm. A monodisperse cluster of n petal\nbubbles is made by blowing air steadily through a cap-\nillary tube. We first isolate one of these bubbles, which\nis therefore circular, and measure its diameter d. We can\nthen calculate the area of the petals, A = \u03c0d2\/4. The large\ncentral bubble is then created with a syringe. The cluster\nis adjusted, using the method described in [11], until the\nlarge bubble lies at the centre of the cluster, as shown in\nFigure 3(a). We then slowly reduce the area of the cen-\ntral bubble by sucking air from it through a syringe. The\ncentral bubble appears at all times to be roughly circular,\nso that its diameter is uniquely defined. We record this\ndiameter dc at frequent intervals until the ejection occurs,\nas in Figure 3(b). Using the last value of the diameter al-\nlows the calculation of the critical central area for ejection,\nA\u2217\u2217c = \u03c0(dc)\n2\/4.\nNote that the central bubble is not exactly circular,\ncf. Figure 1(a). The difference in area between a circular\nbubble and one satisfying the 120\u25e6 condition at vertices is\nless than 4% for n between 7 and 18. We expect that this\nis less than the experimental error.\nWe have found the critical central area for a range of\nvalues of the number of petals n. The results are shown\nin Figure 4 and are compared with the critical area at\nwhich the buckling occurs (1). The experimental results\nlie above the predicted central area for buckling.\nThis suggests that it should be possible to change be-\ntween the ejected and symmetric states with only very\nsmall changes in central bubble area. As the liquid con-\ntent in the experimental system decreases, however, the\nenergy barrier is raised and the ejection is delayed until\nlower values of central area.\n5 Energy of the ejected state\nAt each value of central bubble area the cluster seeks its\nminimum energy state. In a wet system, such as in the\nexperiments described here, the effect of the liquid is to\nallow the system to avoid the energy barrier which sep-\narates alternative states in the strictly 2D model and to\nmove to the ejected state at a larger value of central area\nthan dry calculations would predict. Figure 5 shows this\nschematically for energy values of the 12-petal cluster. In\nthe dry case, we would expect that as the central area\nis reduced, the cluster would first buckle and then eject\na bubble (path X Bd End Y ). However, the presence of\nliquid in the system means that the cluster ejects a bub-\nble at Enw. Pursuing the reduction in central area further\nwill, rather than allowing the cluster to buckle, show that\nanother bubble will be ejected (En\u22121w ) before the point\nis reached at which the cluster with one ejected bubble\nmight be expected to buckle.\nBy calculating the energy (line-length) of both the\nsymmetric and the ejected structures, we are able to pro-\nvide an upper limit to the central area at which (the first)\nejection occurs. We shall find the largest value of central\narea at which the energy of the 2D cluster is lowered when\na bubble is ejected. Comparison with the experimental re-\nsults suggests that this limit is in fact the actual area at\nwhich ejection occurs, because our experimental system\n32 The European Physical Journal E\nEjection upper bound\nBuckling (eq. 1)\nEjection (Experiment)\nNumber of petals n\nC\nen\ntr\na\nl\nA\nre\na\nA\nc\n\/A\n20181614121086\n16\n14\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\nFig. 4.

Also shown is the theoretical critical central area at which a flower\ncluster would buckle in a 2D theory of dry foam, equation (1).\ncontains enough liquid that it can slip to the ejected state\nas soon as it becomes energetically favourable.\nThe energy of the symmetrical cluster in 2D is given by\nEs = 2\n\u221a\nn\n(\u221a\n(Ac + nA)\n(\nsin \u03b8+\n2 sin(\u03c0\/n)\n+ \u03b8+\n)\n\u2212\n\u221a\nAc\n(\nsin \u03b8\u2212\n2 sin(\u03c0\/n)\n\u2212 \u03b8\u2212\n))\n, (2)\nwhere \u03b8\u00b1 = \u03c0\/6 \u00b1 \u03c0\/n [12]. We are unable to calculate\nthe energy of the ejected state analytically, but instead,\nfor a range of values of n, compute it for several values\nof Ac, using the Surface Evolver in an efficient mode in\nwhich edges are treated as arcs of circles [7]. We then find\nthe point at which these two energies are equal, shown in\nFigure 4. The data fit very well to a quadratic power law:\nA\u2217\u2217c = 0.0602(n\u2212 3.45)2A, (3)\nrepresenting the highest value of central area at which\nejection may occur, showing close agreement with the\nexperimental results.\nThese results suggest that a bubble could only be\nejected from the ring whenever there are more than three\npetals in the cluster. This is reasonable, since with only\nthree petals the ejection process would leave an unstable\ntwo-sided bubble that would undergo a further T1.\nThe proximity of the experimental data to this upper\nbound suggests that it should be experimentally possible\nto change between the ejected and symmetric states with\nonly very small changes in central bubble area. Unfortu-\nnately, with our set-up we are only able to withdraw air\n32.5\n33\n33.5\n34\n34.5\n35\n35.5\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nCentral Area \/ Petal Area\nBd\nE w\nX\nSy\nm\nm\netric State\n(u\nnstable)\nd\nEn\ner\ngy\n\/  \nPe\nta\nl A\nre\na\nY Bw\nE\nn\nn\nE\nn-1\nw\nEjection\nSymmetric State\n2nd EjectionZ\nFig. 5. The energy of a 2D flower cluster is shown in the case\nof n = 12 petals (surface tension is set equal to one).

At E\nn\nd\n(which depends upon the precise mode of buckling) an internal\nlength shrinks to zero and the cluster undergoes a T1 change\nand ejects a bubble, following path X Bd E\nn\nd Y . The point Y\nrepresents an (unattainable) buckled cluster with one petal\nejected. The presence of liquid in the real experimental system\nallows the cluster to cross the apparent energy barrier at or\nclose to Enw and to eject a bubble. The (n \u2212 1)-sided central\nbubble might then be expected to buckle at point Bw, so that\nthe wet cluster follows path X Enw Bw Y . However, the pres-\nence of liquid causes the ejection of a second bubble close to\nEn\u22121w . The cluster therefore progresses to point Z due to the\nfurther cascades of bubble ejection which will always pre-empt\nbuckling.\nS.J.

As\nthe liquid content in the experimental system decreases,\nhowever, the energy barrier is raised and the ejection is\ndelayed until lower values of central area. We expect this\nto result in hysteresis as the central bubble area is alter-\nnately increased and decreased.\n6 Two-dimensional froths: theory and\nexperiment\nBefore describing the distribution of the liquid in the ex-\nperimental system in detail, we must first review the pre-\nvailing theoretical and experimental models of 2D foams.\nIt will become clear that the experimental set-up may play\na significant role in determining the behaviour of the sys-\ntem.\nThe standard theoretical model of a dry 2D foam im-\nplies that it consists of arcs of circles which meet in threes\nat angles of 120\u25e6. For small numbers of bubbles, quanti-\nties such as the energy (line-length) and the bubble areas\ncan be calculated analytically. However, these 2D config-\nurations are relatively straightforward to obtain compu-\ntationally: early examples of such code were written by\nKermode and Weaire [13] and Herdtle and Aref [14]; re-\ncently the Surface Evolver [7] has been commonly used.\nTo simulate a wet 2D foam, one approach is to \u201cdec-\norate\u201d each three-fold vertex with a small triangular\nPlateau border [15]. For the more general wet case, soft-\nware written by Bolton and Weaire [16] was used to study\nrheological properties [17]. In this 2D point of view, a\nT1 process occurs when two neighbouring Plateau bor-\nders touch, i.e. when the length of the edge between them\nshrinks to zero. As the foam becomes wetter, the size of the\nPlateau borders increases and the edge length decreases,\nso that topological change is more likely to occur. How-\never, a calculation of the necessary size of the Plateau\nborders shows that such a 2D model is insufficient to ex-\nplain our experimental results. We must therefore seek a\ndifferent explanation, which entails looking closely at 3D\neffects in the experimental system.\nThere are three standard experimental methods of pro-\nducing so-called 2D bubble clusters, and it appears that\ntheir slight differences will cause different behaviour in\nprecise studies of instabilities of foams of the kind dis-\ncussed here. These experimental set-ups are illustrated in\ncross-section in Figure 6:\n(i) The Bragg bubble raft [18], in which a single layer of\nbubbles floats freely on a liquid surface.\n(ii) The system used here in which the bubbles are trapped\nbetween a glass plate and the liquid surface (e.g., [10]).\nIt is similar to the set-up perhaps first used by the au-\nthor of [19], although he also used the following system.\n(iii) A layer of bubbles trapped between two glass plates\n[19,20].\nWhere a soap film meets a glass plate there is a (sur-\nface) Plateau border running along the plate; these bor-\nders are smaller at the top plate due to the effect of gravity.\nWhere a soap film meets the liquid pool there is a menis-\ncus of height lc =\n\u221a\n2\u03b3\/\u03c1g, where \u03b3 is the surface tension\nand \u03c1 the density of the liquid, and g is the acceleration\ndue to gravity. (For our system (i.e. water and surfactant)\nthe height of the meniscus, lc, should be approximately\n2.5mm.) Both menisci and the surface Plateau borders\nmeet in threes and join with a vertical Plateau border to\ngive a fourfold vertex.\nThe principal difference between the usual realization\nof a 2D soap froth (case (iii)) and the other two may lie in\nthe replacement of the lower Plateau border by a menis-\ncus which is not of finite extent. Neighbouring menisci\ninteract, as described by Nicolson [21] and by Shi and\nArgon [22] in their analysis of the Bragg raft, with a po-\ntential energy which decreases with separation. Such an\nanalysis should be possible for the case of vertical Plateau\nborders on a liquid surface, and in future work we hope to\nexplore this situation using three-dimensional simulations\nwith the Surface Evolver.\n7 Length-scale effects\nIn the meantime, however, we performed another series of\nmeasurements which allow us to make one further obser-\nvation: the topological changes, caused by the attraction\nbetween neighbouring fourfold vertices via the meniscus,\noccur at a critical bubble area ratio which appears to be\nindependent of the scale of the experimental system.\nThese experiments involved a cluster of only four bub-\nbles of equal size. We varied both the separation h of the\nglass plate from the liquid surface and the volume V = Ah\n34 The European Physical Journal E\nT1\nFig. 7. To investigate the effect of the meniscus, we start with\na cluster of four bubbles with equal volumes. The volume of\none bubble is then slowly decreased until a topological change\noccurs. In the ideal dry limit, this T1 occurs only when the\ncritical volume is vanishingly small, but our experiments show\nthat it happens at a finite volume that depends upon the sep-\naration of the glass plate from the liquid in the experimental\nsystem.\nof the bubbles. For each value of V and h we slowly re-\nduced the volume of one of the four bubbles using the\nsame techniques as above, until a T1 change occurred.\nThis is shown schematically in Figure 7. In the dry limit,\nwe should not expect the T1 to occur until the volume of\nthe shrinking is vanishingly small, but the experiments on\na wet system show that the critical area is finite.\nThis critical area of the shrinking bubble is recorded\nin Figure 8, showing data for values of h greater than the\ncapillary height lc (the behaviour for h < lc is markedly\ndifferent due to the dominant effect of the meniscus). The\ncritical area at which the T1 occurs is independent of the\nseparation of the glass plate from the liquid surface, and\ndepends linearly on the area of the large bubbles. We ra-\ntionalize this by appeal to the following scaling argument,\nwhich shows that the elastic resistance of the soap films\nto allowing a T1 decreases with increasing cluster size.\nConsider a cluster of fixed shape, with linear scale\nL(\u221d \u221aA), in which two vertices in the meniscus inter-\nact. We denote their initial separation by l, which is also\nproportional to L. We now perturb the system, reducing\nthis separation by a distance \u2206l. To lowest order, \u2206l is\ndetermined by a balance between the attractive force F of\nthe vertices, and the elastic resistance R of the soap films,\nwhich we express as the ratio \u2206l = F\/R.\nFor all but the shortest distances, the attractive force\nF can be treated as a constant to lowest order. We ap-\nproximate the elastic resistance by the second deriva-\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120C\nrit\nica\nl a\nre\na \nof\n s\nhr\nin\nkin\ng \nbu\nbb\nle\n(m\nm2\n)\nSurrounding bubble area (mm2)\nh = 3 mm\nh = 4 mm\nh = 5 mm\nFig. 8. The critical area of the shrinking bubble, described in\nFigure 7, at which a T1 topological change occurs in a cluster of\nfour bubbles. The T1 occurs at a critical area of the shrinking\nbubble which is independent of the separation h. Moreover, the\ncritical area depends linearly (the dashed line is a guide for the\neye with slope one-half) on the area of the large bubbles. We\nshow data only for values of h greater than the capillary height\nlc, since the behaviour for h < lc is markedly different due to\nthe dominant effect of the meniscus.\ntive of the energy of the (dry) cluster with l, so that\nR \u223c L\/L2 = L\u22121. Then \u2206l\/l is constant.\nThe condition for a topological change is that \u2206l is\napproximately equal to l, so that a cluster that satisfies\nthis condition will do so independently of the scale L.\n8 Conclusions\nWhile investigating experimentally the multiple states of\ntwo-dimensional foams, we have encountered an unex-\npected ejection instability. This is provoked by a topolog-\nical (T1) change that moves the system to a lower energy\nstate. The instability occurs before that predicted by a\ntheory based upon dry foams: the presence of even a small\namount of liquid in the experimental system provokes the\nT1 as soon as the energy of the ejected state is lower.\nWe chose one of the three possible experimental sys-\ntems used for studying 2D froths, the case of a cluster\nsandwiched between a glass plate and a liquid surface. In\ndescribing the distribution of liquid in such a cluster, it\nbecomes apparent that perhaps the three systems do not\nshow the same response. In this case it appears to be the\nmeniscus that causes the discrepancy. This may be a sig-\nnificant factor in the differences between the rheological\nresults of Debregeas et al. [3] and Lauridsen et al. [4] for\nexample.\nWe are currently undertaking further work to eluci-\ndate and quantify further these effects, and identify more\nclearly than heretofore the essential differences between\nthe three experimental systems of Figure 6. In particu-\nlar, it now seems worthwhile to perform identical experi-\nments on the systems shown in cases (ii) and (iii), with as\nlittle entrained liquid as possible, to ascertain the effect\nof the meniscus. While it seems likely that the Plateau\nborders that are present in the case of two glass plates\nwould also engender a discrepancy from the dry case, this\nS.J. Cox et al.: Topological changes in a two-dimensional foam cluster 35\neffect should decrease to zero as the liquid content is de-\ncreased [16].\nTogether with other related investigations, such stud-\nies are needed to understand in fully quantitative terms\nthe properties of real 2D foams. Whereas they were intro-\nduced by Smith [19] with qualitative effects and general\ntopological properties in mind, today they are subject to\nmuch closer scrutiny. They seem to provide an excellent\ntest bed for the development of models of the behaviour\nof soft matter, which may prove to be of much wider rel-\nevance.\nThe authors wish to thank F. Graner, W.
