Introduction\n[2] Electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves can be\nexcited by an anisotropic distribution of energetic ring\ncurrent ions, with energies of a few tens keV. Previous\nstudies [Gomberoff and Neira, 1983; Young et al., 1981;\nHorne and Thorne, 1993] have shown that the generation\nand propagation characteristics of EMIC waves in a multi-\nion (H+; He+; O+) plasma are profoundly controlled by ion\nfractional composition and by the ratio wpe\/jWej, i.e., the\nratio of electron plasma to gyrofrequency. EMIC waves can\nalso be guided by density gradients at the plasmapause,\nwhich keep the wave normal angle small and significantly\nenhance the path integrated gain [Thorne and Horne, 1997].\n[3] EMIC waves excited during storms can also resonate\nwith relativistic electrons, causing rapid scattering loss\n[Thorne and Kennel, 1971], but the minimum energy for\nelectron resonance is strongly dependent on ion composi-\ntion and plasma density [Summers and Thorne, 2003;\nAlbert, 2003; Li et al., 2007]. A statistical study of EMIC\nwaves observed on CRRES [Meredith et al., 2003] showed\nthat the minimum resonant energy for electrons was gener-\nally \u00012 MeV for the majority of EMIC wave events, but\nabout 11% of reported EMIC events had minimum resonant\nenergy <2 MeV. EMIC waves with amplitude up to 10 nT\nhave been observed during the main phase of magnetic\nstorm [Erlandson and Ukhorskiy, 2001], capable of induc-\ning strong scattering of relativistic electrons at a rate\ncomparable to the strong diffusion limit [Shprits et al.,\n2009]. Such loss is confined to high-density regions just\ninside the plasmapause or within dayside drainage plumes\n[Thorne et al., 2006; Jordanova et al., 2008]. Electron\ndensity inside such storm time plumes exhibits fine-scale\nstructures [Goldstein et al., 2004; Spasojevic\u00b4 et al., 2003,\n2004]. Furthermore, as illustrated in Figure 1, such plumes\ntend to be wrapped around the plasmapause during the\nstorm recovery, leading to radial density gradients, which\ncan strongly influence EMIC wave propagation, in after-\nnoon dust MLT sectors. Such density structure in the plume\nhas not been included in previous simulations of wave\nexcitation. Consequently, in this study, detailed ray tracing\nis performed with the HOTRAY code [Horne, 1989] to\nexamine the most favorable regions for EMIC wave exci-\ntation, the typical frequency distribution of excited waves,\nand the ability of the waves to scatter energetic electrons.\n[4] The outline of this paper is as follows. In section 2, a\nmodel of thermal plasma density is described. Ray tracing\nresults together with calculation of minimum electron\nresonant energy are presented in section 3, and the sensi-\ntivity of simulated EMIC wave gains and corresponding\nminimum electron resonant energy to thermal ion compo-\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 114, A07221, doi:10.1029\/2009JA014204, 2009\n1Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, University of\nCalifornia, Los Angeles, California, USA.\n2British Antarctic Survey, Natural Environment Research Council,\nCambridge, UK.\nCopyright 2009 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/09\/2009JA014204\nA07221 1 of 11\nsition, plume density variation and ring current proton\nproperties are considered in section 4. In section 5, we\nsummarize our principal conclusions. Finally, the paper\nends with a discussion.\n2. Plasma Model for Ray Tracing\n[5] Here we use ray racing to calculate the propagation\npaths of EMIC waves in a non uniform plasma, and to\nevaluate the path integrated gain. We use the HOTRAY\ncode [Horne, 1989] which has been applied to electromag-\nnetic and electrostatic waves, including EMIC waves in the\nEarth\u2019s magnetosphere [Horne and Thorne, 1993, 1994].\nThe code can trace any type of wave in a hot magnetized\nplasma with weak growth or damping, provided the wave\nremains linear. The ray tracing method assumes that gra-\ndients in the medium, notably the plasma density and\nmagnetic field gradients, are small compared to the wave-\nlength, and that the gradients remain continuous. The\nHOTRAY code checks this condition at every step along\nthe raypath. The ray tracing equations [Horne, 1989,\nequations (1) and (2)] are integrated with respect to time\nto find the new position, and wave number at each time\nstep. The hot plasma dispersion relation is solved at each\nstep along the raypath keeping the frequency constant and\ncalculating a complex wave vector k. The imaginary part of\nk, ki, is used to calculate the path integrated gain. Landau\nand up to 100 cyclotron harmonic resonances are used to\nsolve the hot plasma dispersion relation. More details of the\nmethod can be found in [Horne, 1989; Horne and Thorne,\n1993, 1994].\n[6] To perform ray tracing in a heterogeneous magneto-\nspheric plasma, an analytical model with a smoothly vary-\ning spatial distribution of magnetic field and density is\nrequired. Here a dipole magnetic field model is used. For\nsimplicity, the density model is assumed to have no\nazimuthal variation in density to allow two-dimensional\nray tracing in a meridian plane. The adopted density\nmodel represents the storm time magnetosphere by\nincluding a plasmapause and a high-density plume with\na fine-scale density variation. The precise location of the\nplasmapause and plume can be adjusted to fit observa-\ntions. A smooth model for cold electron density is\nconstructed as follows.\n[7] 1. The electron density model combines an equatorial\ndensity model for the plasmasphere and trough [Sheeley et\nal., 2001] and field-aligned density variation [Denton et al.,\n2006]. The plasmasphere (ps) and trough (tr) density, nps\nand ntr, can be expressed as\nnps \u00bc 1390 3=L\u00f0 \u00de4:83 LRE=r\u00f0 \u00deaps \u00f01\u00de\nntr \u00bc 124 3=L\u00f0 \u00de4:0 \u00fe 36 3=L\u00f0 \u00de3:5 cos\nn\nMLT\n\u0002\n\u0007 7:7 3=L\u00f0 \u00de2:0 \u00fe 12\nh io\np=12\n\u0006\nLRE=r\u00f0 \u00deatr \u00f02\u00de\nwhere L is the L shell parameter, RE the Earth radii, r the\ndistance away from the center of the Earth. MLT is\nnominally chosen to be 18, but the results could equally\napply to other MLTs, and the parameters controlling\nlatitudinal variation in number density, aps and atr are\ntaken to be 0.8 and 2.0, respectively, following Denton et al.\n[2006]. The plasmapause is established with an inner edge\nLppi = 3.5 and width 0.1 RE (the center of plasmapause Lpp =\n3.55), which corresponds to a moderate storm time\ncondition Kp = 4.6 [Carpenter and Anderson, 1992].\n[8] 2. The storm time plume (pl) is established over the L\nrange L0 < L < L1, where L0 and L1 are locations for the\nplume inner and outer edges, with a density fluctuations\ngiven by\nnpl \u00bc P \u0007 B 1\u0007 cos 2pN L\u0007 L0\nL1 \u0007 L0\n\u0007 \b\u0007 \b\t \n\nntr \u00f03\u00de\nP is a constant factor by which the density peaks in the\nplume are enhanced relative to trough density, and B and N\nare parameters controlling the magnitude and the number of\ndensity fluctuations inside the plume.\n[9] 3.

A transition width of 0.1 RE is assumed\nat the boundaries L = Lpp, L = L0 and L = L1, i.e., DLpp =\nDL0 = DL1 = 0.05.\n[10] Figure 2b shows the equatorial electron density as\na function of L, with parameters L0 = 4.5, L1 = 5.5, P = 9,\nB = 3 and N = 5. The value of P is selected to ensure that the\nratio of electron plasma to gyrofrequency wpe\/jWej lies in the\nrange from 10 to 20 inside the plume, consistent with\nmeasurement [e.g., Summers et al., 2008]. The upper and\nlower envelopes of the density inside the plume are Pntr and\n(P \u0007 2B)ntr, respectively. Thus the magnitude of density\nvariation is about 2Bntr over one periodic length, which\nequals (L1 \u0007 L0)RE\/N = 1\/5 RE in our simulation.\n[11] A multi-ion H+-He+-O+ magnetosphere plasma is\nadopted with uniform ion composition throughout the\nsimulation region. Previous studies indicate heavy ion\ncomposition, hHe+ and hO+, in the range from 5% to 20%\nand from 1% to 10%, respectively, but since the ion\ncomposition can vary substantially, hHe+ and hO+ will be\ntreated as free parameters to investigate the sensitivity on\nwave excitation and resulting electron cyclotron resonant\nenergy.\n[12] The thermal distribution for electron is assumed to be\nMaxwellian with an isotropic temperature of 10 eV [Horne\nand Thorne, 1994]. The thermal ions have the same\ndistribution with temperature 1 eV for all H+, He+ and O+\nspecies. A hot ring current proton population is introduced\nas a source of free energy to drive the excitation of EMIC\nwaves. The ring current proton distribution is assumed to be\nbi-Maxwellian with anisotropic temperature T?H+ > TkH+.\nFor simplicity in the simulations the density of hot protons\nis fixed at 0.1 cm\u00073, independent of location, but the wave\ngain can be scaled up or down, on the basis of any measured\nprofile of ring current proton density, since the wave gain is\nproportional to the number density of hot protons in the\nlinear regime. Five free parameters remain to be specified in\nthe model: hHe+, hO +, TkH +, T?H + (or anisotropy for hot H\n+\nspecies AH + = T?H +\/TkH + \u0007 1), and B. A realistic spatial\ndistribution of ring current proton density also need to be\nspecified to obtain the radial wave gain profile.\n3. Raypath Integrated Gain\n[13] HOTRAY code [Horne, 1989] is used to trace the\nraypath and evaluate path integrated gain of L mode EMIC\nwaves in the He+ and H+ bands using the plasma model\ndescribed in section 2. Guided waves in the He+ band occur\nwith left hand polarization in the frequency range wcrO+ < w <\nWHe+ (mode 5 in the work by Horne and Thorne [1993]),\nwhere wcrO+ is the O\n+ crossover frequency and WHe+ the He\n+\ngyrofrequency. Guided left-handed polarized waves in the\nH+ band occur in the frequency range wcrHe+ < w < WH+\n(mode 4 in the work by Horne and Thorne [1993]), where\nwcrHe+ is the He\n+ crossover frequency and WH+ is the H\n+\ngyrofrequency. All waves are initiated at the equator with a\nFigure 2. (a) Maximumwave gain as a function of normalized frequency and L shell for a bi-Maxwellian\nhot proton distribution (density 1 cm\u00073, T?H+ = 50 keV and TkH+ = 25 keV) and (b) the thermal plasma\ndensity model.\nA07221 CHEN ET AL.: EMIC EXCITATION IN PLUMES\n3 of 11\nA07221\nwave vector parallel to the ambient magnetic field. As the\nwaves propagate, the polarization may become elliptical and\neven change to right handed below the crossover frequency,\nbut the waves should remain on the same dispersion surface.\nThe maximum wave gain along a raypath from the equator to\nthe wave reflection location is obtained as a function of L\nand wave frequency normalized to the equatorial O+ gyro-\nfrequency, w\/WeqO+. An example of the radial profile of\nmaximum gain is shown in Figure 2a using the electron\ndensity profile shown in Figure 2b with P = 9, B = 3, N = 5,\nion composition hHe+ = 10% and hO+ = 1%, for a hot proton\ntemperature T?H + = 50 keV and TkH + = 25 keV and density\n1.0 cm\u00073. The maximum gain shown in Figure 2b would\nalso be identical to the wave gain at the equator for waves\nwhich are traced backward along the raypath. The backward\nray tracing can be done through the following two steps.\nFirst, waves are traced forward from the equator (with initial\nzero wave normal angle) to high latitude until they encoun-\ntered a region where they are heavily damped. Then we\nreverse the k vector and the direction of ray tracing so that\nthe waves propagate backward along the same raypaths until\nthey cross the equator. In this way, any wave growth that\ntakes place as the waves propagate toward high latitude\nshould be identical to those waves propagating toward the\nequator, which should cross the equator with zero wave\nnormal angle. Waves which experience strong wave gain on\nsuch a backward path are capable of resonating at the equator\nwith the minimum energy electrons along the raypath. The\nwave gain can be scaled up or down to the measured density\nof ring current ions. Here, we arbitrarily normalize the gain\nto a hot proton density of 1 cm\u00073, which is comparable to the\nring current proton density observed near L\n 5 during storm\ntime conditions [e.g., Frank, 1967].\n[14] As noted earlier by Thorne and Horne [1997],\nmoderate wave gain in the He+ band occurs at the inner\nedge of the plasmapause, because of the strong negative\ndensity gradient. Such density gradients tend to refract the\nwaves inward against the outward refraction caused by\nmagnetic curvature: this ensures that the wave normal angle\nremains small over a significant raypath length, thus max-\nimizing the wave gain. The gain in Figure 2b is obtained by\nassuming 1 cm\u00073 hot proton density, which is probably an\nunderestimate for storm time conditions. Consequently, gain\nnear the plasmapause should be substantially larger when a\nmore realistic profile of ring current density during storm\ntime condition is adopted.\n[15] For Nhot = 1 cm\n\u00073, strongest gain in the He+ band is\nconfined to the outer trough region at large L, and the\nextended region centered near the negative density gradients\ninside the plume. For the adopted parameters, wave gain in\nthe He+ band is substantially greater than the gain in the H+\nband throughout the simulation domain. The increased\nwave gain in the low-density trough at larger L can be\nexplained by the combined effect of the increase in the ratio\nwpe\/jWej, which lowers the proton resonant energy, and the\nincrease in the ratio of the number of resonant proton to the\nlocal plasma density [Kennel and Petschek, 1966], both\nof which tend to enhance the wave growth rate. Increasing\nwpe\/jWej also reduces the peak normalized frequency,\nbecause the lower-frequency waves can resonate with the\nmajority of hot proton at the adopted temperature. The\nunstable wave frequency band in the outer trough is\nconfined to the range from 2.5 WO+ to 3.5 WO+.\n[16] The gain for both the He+ and H+ bands inside the\nplume is strongly modulated by the density variation.\nEnhanced wave gain for both He+ and H+ band occurs over\nFigure 3. Ray tracing results for four different EMIC wave frequencies initiated inside the plume at\nL = 5.11, where there is negative density gradient.

The width of the former side is relatively\nnarrow, compared to the latter. The location where the He+\nband waves obtain peak gain for each of the six regions is\nslightly outside the corresponding density peak in regions of\nmodest negative density gradient. The band of unstable\nwave frequency can extend from below 2 WO+ to about\n3.7 WO+, which is broader than the unstable wave band in\nthe outer trough region. Waves excited at the frequencies\nabove 3.5 WO+, which are able to resonate with relativistic\nelectron of relatively lower energy, is also stronger near the\ndensity peak in the plume than that in the density minima.\nHowever, waves with frequencies very close to the He+\ngyrofrequency (>3.7 WO+) are subject to severe damping\nbecause of cyclotron resonant absorption by thermal He+.\nThe location of peak wave gain is due to a combination of\nwave refraction by negative density gradient, which keeps\nthe waves more field aligned, and the heightened density\nwith high value of wpe\/jWej, which lowers ion resonant\nenergy. Smaller wave gain occurs just inside the peak\ndensity where the density gradient is positive but small,\nprimarily because of the heighten density and thus lower\nproton resonant energy.\n[17] An interesting guiding phenomenon occurs for the\nwaves starting at locations of negative density gradient.\nBoth the raypath and wave normal angle of these waves\nexhibit oscillations around the magnetic fields. Figure 3\nshows an example of propagation characteristics along the\nraypath of four waves with different frequencies starting\nslightly outside a density peak (L = 5.10) in the plume\nregion at L = 5.11. All the waves are initially guided along\nthe magnetic field line, maintain small wave normal angles\n(\u000b10\u0001) over a larger part of the raypath, and thus obtain\nlarger gain. The behavior of the wave normal angle is a\nresult of the competition between refraction due to plasma\ndensity gradients and magnetic field gradients and curva-\nture: the negative (positive) radial density gradient tends to\ndrive the wave vector inward (outward) while refraction by\nthe dipole magnetic field gradients and curvature, which is\nenhanced at lower L, always tends to refract wave vector\noutward. The oscillating wave normal angle is caused by\nthe balance between refraction by the negative density\ngradient and by the effect of the magnetic field, especially\nfor the wave with w = 3.05WeqO+ (blue line) whose normal\nangle is less than 2\u0001 over the first 70 s. Initially all these\nwaves tend to migrate toward smaller L shell because of\nstronger inward refraction associated with the steep negative\ndensity gradient. These waves are pulled back and toward\nthe other side of the density peaks, where the magnetic\nrefraction again dominates. These waves then migrate back\nto larger L. Rapid oscillations in both wave vector and wave\nposition vector along the magnetic field line eventually\noccurs at the density peak location (L = 5.1), which is\nassociated with ducting processes occurring in the density\npeak region.\n[18] As waves propagate toward high latitude, the cyclo-\ntron resonant energy for both electrons and protons\nincreases rapidly, because of the combination of lower\nw\/WO+ at higher latitude and lower wpe\/We. Waves with\nw = 2.25 WO+ have relatively larger gain because the\nwave remains in cyclotron resonance over a longer time\nperiod with the major portion of the hot protons (with\nenergy 25 keV). The waves are able to resonate with\nrelativistic electron with several MeV parallel energy near\nthe equator, but the resonant energy increases rapidly as\nwaves propagate toward high latitudes.

The same as Figure 3 except for ray tracing results at one of the density minimums inside the\nplume, L = 5.20.\nA07221 CHEN ET AL.: EMIC EXCITATION IN PLUMES\n5 of 11\nA07221\nquencies closer to WHe+ result in lower minimum electron\nresonant energy, because of the lower wave phase velocity.\n[19] Examples of the propagation characteristics of waves\nstarting at one of density minimum region (L = 5.2) are\nshown in Figure 4. In this case, the density gradient has\nlittle effect on the wave normal, and magnetic curvature and\ngradients cause the wave to be refracted rapidly to highly\noblique wave normal angle. As a result, the integrated wave\ngain is significantly suppressed to generally less than 5 dB,\nwhich is an order of magnitude smaller than wave gain near\nthe density peaks.\n[20] The ring current density is not uniform, but tends to\nmaximize near the plasmapause [e.g., Frank, 1967; Thorne\nand Horne, 1997]. A realistic ring current density distribu-\ntion is required to simulate the spatial location of excited\nEMIC waves. Under the conditions when wave growth rate\nis small enough to ignore nonlinear effect, and that the ring\ncurrent density itself is small enough that the wave disper-\nsion relation is primarily determined by the thermal species,\none may scale the results shown in Figure 2 to any specified\nradial profile of ring current density. To simulate a realistic\nring current density profile during storm conditions, we\nadopt a Gaussian distribution over L, which has peak value\n10 cm\u00073 at plasmapause location L = 3.5, and 2.5 cm\u00073 at\nL = 5.0, corresponding to the middle of the plume, 1 cm\u00073\nat L = 7.0, as shown in Figure 5a.\n[21] We adopt the criterion that at least 40 dB of wave\ngain is required to allow waves to grow to observable levels\nfrom the background noise. The spatial regime and normal-\nized frequency where one would anticipate significant wave\nexcitation is indicated by the colored areas in Figure 5. The\ncolor itself denotes the minimum electron resonant energy\nwith these excited waves. For the adopted parameters, no\nwaves in the H+ band obtain gain greater than 40 dB.\nExcited waves in the He+ band are confined to just inside\nthe plasmapause, narrow regions near each density peak\ninside the plume and L > 6.5 in outer trough. The broadest\nspectrum of waves 1.6WO+ \u000b w \u000b 3.7WO+ is found inside the\nplume, the second broadest 2.2WO+ \u000b w \u000b 3.75WO+ just\ninside the plasmapause, and the narrowest spectrum\n(2.8WO+ \u000b w \u000b 3.25WO+) in the low-density outer trough\nregion. Waves excited near the plasmapause are only able\nto resonate with electrons above 3 MeV. The minimum\nelectron resonant energy with EMIC waves inside the\nplume is generally above 2 MeV, while EMIC waves\nexcited in the outer trough can only resonant with elec-\ntrons above at least 8 MeV.\n4. Sensitivity of Results to Model Parameters\n[22] The results described above were obtained with a set\nof five nominal but realistic free parameters: hHe+ = 10%,\nhO+ = 1%, TkH+ = 25 keV, T?H+ = 50 keV, and B = 3. To\nassess the robustness of the general features of our simula-\ntion of EMIC wave excitation, a sensitivity study is per-\nformed on each of these five free parameters, holding the\nother parameters constant and using the same ring current\ndensity profile shown in Figure 5a.\n4.1. Variable Ion Composition\n[23] The sensitivity of the EMIC wave gain and the\ncorresponding minimum electron resonant energy to varia-\ntion in ion composition is explored in Figure 6. Variations in\nthe O+ composition from 1% to 10% (holding the He+\ncomposition constant) are considered in Figures 6a and 6b.\nWhen the O+ composition is increased, the lower cutoff of\nexcited He+ band increases because of an increase in the O+\ncrossover frequency, while the upper cutoff is slightly\nreduced. An increase in O+ composition also leads to a\nreduction in the wave gain and an increase in the electron\nminimum resonant energy over the entire excited He+ band.\nIn Figures 6c and 6d, the O+ composition is kept constant\nFigure 5. (a) Ring current proton density profile adopted to represent storm time profile. (b) Minimum\nelectron resonant energy with wave gain greater than 40 dB, assuming ring current proton density profile\nin Figure 5a. White area denotes the regime where wave gain is below 40 dB.\nA07221 CHEN ET AL.: EMIC EXCITATION IN PLUMES\n6 of 11\nA07221\n(1%) and the He+ composition is varied from 5% to 20%.\nLarger He+ composition results in a slight shift of excited\nwave band toward lower frequency with similar peak gain.\nLowering of the upper cutoff frequency for excited waves is\ndue to enhanced He+ cyclotron resonance absorption at\nwave frequencies close to the He+ gyrofrequency. Despite\nthis, the minimum electron resonant energy is reduced to\nvalues below 2 MeV for high (20%) He+ composition,\nbecause of a lowering of the wave phase velocity.\n4.2. Plume Density Variation\n[24] The effect of varying the magnitude of the density\nvariation is investigated in Figure 7 by varying the parameterB\nin equation (3) from 3 to 0.25. Increased density variation (and\nassociated density gradients) enhances wave gain throughout\nthe He+ band, especially for wave frequencies above 2 WO+.\nHowever, waves with frequencies above 3.7 WO+ are totally\nsuppressed by the thermal He+ cyclotron absorption, regard-\nless of the magnitude of the density variation.\n[25] Profiles of the wave gain and corresponding mini-\nmum electron resonant energy are shown in Figure 8 as a\nfunction of normalized wave frequency over one periodic\nlength (4.9 \u000b L \u000b 5.1) of density variation inside the plume,\nfor different amplitude of density variation. Highest wave\ngain is found over a broader region on the negative density\ngradient side of the plume because of strong guiding of\nwaves by the negative density gradients, which counteracts\nthe effect of magnetic field gradients and curvature. Wave\ngain also occurs over a narrower region just before the\ndensity peak, primarily as a result of the heightened density,\nwhich lowers proton resonant energy and therefore increas-\ning the growth rate. Wave gain inside the plume is smallest\nnear the density minimum. As the overall density variation\nin the plume decreases (smaller B), the wave excitation\nregion on the negative gradient side becomes broader, and\nthe maximum gain is reduced and shifts toward lower\nfrequency. Meanwhile the wave excitation region just inside\nthe density peak slightly extends further inward. When the\ndensity variation is small, EMIC waves tends to grow to\nobservable level throughout the whole region (4.9 \u000b L \u000b\n5.1), and the excited wave spectrum peaks at about 2 WO+,\nFigure 6.

Horizontal dashed line\ndenotes the 40 dB gain.\nA07221 CHEN ET AL.: EMIC EXCITATION IN PLUMES\n7 of 11\nA07221\nas shown in Figure 8g. Consequently, EMIC waves excited\ninside a plume without significant density variation, are\nonly able to resonate with electron above 5 MeV, compared\nto 2 MeV when the density variation is larger.\n4.3. Variation of Hot Proton Temperature\nand Anisotropy\n[26] Figure 9 shows the wave gain in the He+ band for\ndifferent hot proton temperature. By decreasing the parallel\ntemperature TkH + of hot H\n+ from 25 keV to 10 keV while\nkeeping the anisotropy AH+ = 1, the wave gain in the He\n+\nband is suppressed at lower frequencies. However, the\nexcitation at high normalized wave frequencies is not\nsignificantly affected. Consequently, there will be little\neffect on the minimum energy for electron resonance. Wave\ngain decreases for all wave frequencies when the anisotropy\ndecreases while keeping the parallel temperature the same.\n[27] In order to simulate the enhancement of ring current\nanisotropy due to solar wind compression on the dayside\nmagnetosphere at large L, we perform a ray tracing in\nthe trough at L = 6.8 for TkH+ = 10 keV and allow the\nanisotropy to increase from 1 to 1.5 (Figure 10). Although\nincreased anisotropy leads to enhanced wave gain at all\nfrequencies, only waves in the H+ band, with frequency just\nabove the He+ crossover frequency, are able to grow to\nobservable level. This is consistent with observations of\nEMIC waves in outer magnetosphere [Anderson et al.,\n1990] and also with the earlier simulation of Horne and\nThorne [1997].\n5. Summary of Principal Results\n[28] The principal conclusion in this study can be sum-\nmarized as follows.\n[29] 1. On the basis of a realistic model for the spatial\ndistribution of thermal plasma and hot ring current ion, path\nintegrated gain calculation with HOTRAY indicates three\npreferred regions of cyclotron resonant EMIC wave excita-\ntion: just inside the plasmapause, within high-density drain-\nage plumes, and in the low-density trough at L > 6.5.\n[30] 2. For modest ring current anisotropy, the strongest\nwave amplification (>40 dB) occurs over a broad frequency\nband below the equatorial He+ gyrofrequency, within high-\ndensity structured drainage plumes.\n[31] 3. Density structure in the plumes can guide waves,\nkeeping the wave normal angle small, leading to an order of\nmagnitude enhancement in net gain in regions where the\nradial density gradient is negative.\nFigure 8.

Relativistic electrons can resonate with excited\nEMIC waves, causing rapid scattering loss. However, the\nminimum resonant electron energies tend to be several MeV\nfor EMIC waves in plumes and near the plasmapause and\n>8 MeV in the low-density trough. This result is relatively\nindependent of adopted parameters in the simulation.\n[33] 5. Observation of the H+ band EMIC waves in the\nouter dayside magnetosphere can be explained by an\nFigure 9.

Discussion\n[34] EMIC waves are important in magnetospheric dy-\nnamics since they are able to cause heating of the thermal\nplasma [Thorne and Horne, 1992; Horne and Thorne,\n1997], and pitch angle scattering and loss of both ring\ncurrent ions [Cornwall et al., 1970] and relativistic electrons\n[e.g., Thorne and Kennel, 1971]. The interaction with\nrelativistic electrons is particularly important since EMIC\nwaves alone have the potential to cause strong diffusion\nscattering [Shprits et al., 2009], which could be the cause of\nsudden electron dropouts from the radiation belt [Millan et\nal., 2002]. However, the minimum energy for parasitic\nscattering of relativistic electrons is extremely dependent\non both the frequency spectrum of the EMIC waves, and the\ncomposition and density of thermal plasma [e.g., Thorne et\nal., 2006; Li et al., 2007]. Specifically, the electron mini-\nmum energy is lower in locations where the phase speed of\nEMIC waves are reduced, which favors equatorial regions\nwith high density and wave frequencies just below the He+\ngyrofrequency [Summers and Thorne, 2003]. A quantitative\nassessment of the ability of EMIC waves to scatter relativ-\nistic electrons is complicated by the fact that, for a specified\nhot ion population, the most unstable excited wave frequen-\ncies tend to be lower (higher) in regions of higher (lower)\ndensity. EMIC waves also tend to have group velocities\nclosely aligned with the magnetic field, which effectively\nprevents higher-frequency waves, excited in lower-density\nregions, from accessing high-density regions where the\nresonant electron energies are lower. Consequently, a self-\nconsistent simulation of wave excitation and associated\nelectron scattering is required to better understand the\npotential of EMIC waves to cause scattering loss of rela-\ntivistic electrons. Previous studies of such scattering have\nidentified the global regions for EMIC excitation [e.g.,\nJordanova et al., 2008] and evaluated the rates of scattering\nfrom a specified EMIC wave spectrum [e.g., Li et al., 2007],\nbut the earlier analyses of scattering rates have not been\nperformed in a self-consistent manner. The analysis per-\nformed in the present study is the first to simulate the\nspectral properties of excited waves and directly utilize this\ninformation to evaluate electron resonant energies. The\nresults confirm the basic conclusion of previous studies,\nwhich indicate that relativistic electrons are able to be\nscattered by EMIC waves excited during storm conditions.\nHowever, we find that such scattering is confined to\nenergies typically greater than 2 MeV in high-density\nregions (plasmapause and plumes) and greater than 8 MeV\nin the low-density trough. This conclusion appears to be\nreasonably robust and is not very sensitive to precise values\nadopted for wpe\/Wce or the ion composition.\n[35] In future work we plan to test the predictions of our\nmodeling of both the preferred regions of wave excitation\nand associated resonant electron scattering against available\nobservation data, and incorporate the results into global\nmodeling of the storm time dynamics of the ring current and\nradiation belt. Further improvements in the modeling should\ninclude the role of ring current O+ ions, which tends to\nreduce EMIC instability in the He+ frequency band [Thorne\nand Horne, 1997], and extension of ray tracing to three\ndimensions using more realistic model for the density\nstructure in the inner magnetosphere.\n[36] Acknowledgments.
