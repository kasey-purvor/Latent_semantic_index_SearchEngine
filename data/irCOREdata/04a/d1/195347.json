Giavaras, P. A. Maksym, and M. Roy\nDepartment of Physics and Astronomy, University of Leicester, Leicester LE1 7RH, UK\n(Dated: May 21, 2008)\nMassless Dirac particles cannot be confined by an electrostatic potential. This is a problem for\nmaking graphene quantum dots but confinement can be achieved with a magnetic field and here,\ngeneral conditions for confined and deconfined states are derived. There is a class of potentials\nfor which the character of the state can be controlled at will. Then a confinement-deconfinement\ntransition occurs which allows the Klein paradox to be probed experimentally in graphene dots.\nPACS numbers: 73.21.La, 73.63.Kv, 73.63.-b, 81.05.Uw\nSingle layer graphene is attracting attention because\nits charge carriers are massless, relativistic particles [1].\nThe relativistic effects result from a unique, zero-gap\nband structure that leads to quantum states described\nby the two-component Dirac-Weyl equation. This allows\nrelativistic physics to be explored in a solid state system\nand has many potential applications ranging from high\nfrequency electronics [1] to quantum computing [2]. In\nparticular, graphene quantum dots are very attractive as\nspin qubits because they are expected to have low spin\ndecoherence [2]. However there is a problem with mak-\ning graphene dots for quantum computing or any other\napplication: relativistic effects prevent massless particles\nfrom being confined by an external potential.\nThe problem results from the Klein paradox [3, 4, 5].\nWhen relativistic particles with mass are incident on a 1D\npotential barrier, the state in the barrier decays exponen-\ntially unless the barrier height exceeds the threshold for\npair production, at which point the state in the barrier\nbecomes oscillatory. The paradox is that any attempt to\nenhance the localisation by increasing the barrier height\neventually destroys it. But there is no threshold for pair\nproduction for massless particles so exponential decay\nand bound states do not occur.\nGraphene dots can be formed from external poten-\ntials or nanocrystals. The quantum states [6, 7, 8, 9],\nin external potentials [10] are quasi-bound: they have\na low amplitude oscillatory tail and are similar to the\nscattering resonances studied in undergraduate physics.\nA perpendicular magnetic field enhances the localisation\nof these states [7] and true bound states can occur in\ngraphene dots defined by a spatially non-uniform field\n[8]. So a magnetic vector potential has a localising effect\nthat tends to cancel the delocalising effect of a scalar po-\ntential. But what are the general conditions for confined\nstates to occur when an electrostatic scalar potential and\na magnetic vector potential are applied to graphene si-\nmultaneously?\nThis question is answered in the present Letter. It\nis shown that both true bound states and quasi-bound\nstates occur, depending on the form of the potentials. In\naddition, there is a third and most interesting possibil-\nity. In some cases, the character of the states depends on\nthe parameters of the potentials and can be controlled\nat will. A confinement-deconfinement transition then oc-\ncurs in which the character of the states changes from\noscillatory to exponential as in the Klein paradox for par-\nticles with mass. This gives a way of probing the Klein\nparadox experimentally in a solid state system and nu-\nmerical studies of the quantum states in a realistic dot\nmodel show it is feasible.\nThe system considered here is a cylindrically symmet-\nric graphene dot. The dot region is defined by an electro-\nstatic potential, V (r), and the magnetic vector potential,\nA\u03b8(r), is in the azimuthal (\u03b8) direction. The functional\nform of these potentials has a significant effect on the\ncharacter of the states. In particular, when V and A\u03b8\nincrease as power laws, V = V0r\ns, A\u03b8 = A0r\nt, s, t > 0,\nthe character of the states depends critically on s and\nt. If s > t the states oscillate in the asymptotic regime\nof large r but decay exponentially when s < t. In both\ncases the asymptotic character of the states is indepen-\ndent of V0 and A0 but when s = t the character of the\nstates does depend on these constants and a transition\nfrom exponential to oscillatory behaviour occurs when V0\nis increased or A0 is decreased. This is the confinement-\ndeconfinement transition.\nThe two-component envelope function, \u03c8, satisfies\n(V + \u03b3\u03c3 \u00b7 pi\/h\u00af)\u03c8 = E\u03c8, where \u03c3 are the Pauli ma-\ntrices, pi = p + eA and \u03b3 = 646 meV nm [7]. For\ncylindrically symmetric systems \u03c8 = (\u03c71(r) exp(i(m \u2212\n1)\u03b8), \u03c72(r) exp(im\u03b8)) where m is the angular momentum\nquantum number. The radial functions \u03c71 and \u03c72 satisfy\nV\n\u03b3\n\u03c71 \u2212 i\nd\u03c72\ndr\n\u2212 i\nm\nr\n\u03c72 \u2212 i\ne\nh\u00af\nA\u03b8\u03c72 =\nE\n\u03b3\n\u03c71, (1)\n\u2212i\nd\u03c71\ndr\n+ i\n(m\u2212 1)\nr\n\u03c71 + i\ne\nh\u00af\nA\u03b8\u03c71 +\nV\n\u03b3\n\u03c72 =\nE\n\u03b3\n\u03c72. (2)\nThese equations can be uncoupled by differentiating\nthem and this leads to the relation\n\u03c7\u2032\u2032\n2\n+ a(r)\u03c7\u2032\n2\n+ b(r)\u03c72 = 0, (3)\nwhere\na(r) =\n1\nr\n+\n1\nE \u2212 V\ndV\ndr\n, (4)\n2b(r) = \u2212\nm2\nr2\n+\n(m\nr\n+\ne\nh\u00af\nA\u03b8\n) 1\nE \u2212 V\ndV\ndr\n\u2212\n(2m\u2212 1)\nr\ne\nh\u00af\nA\u03b8\n+\ne\nh\u00af\ndA\u03b8\ndr\n+\n(E \u2212 V )2\n\u03b32\n\u2212\ne2\nh\u00af2\nA2\u03b8. (5)\nThe first order derivative in Eq. (3) is eliminated by\nputting \u03c72(r) = u2(r) exp(\u2212\n\u222b\na(r)dr\/2) which gives\nu\u2032\u2032\n2\n+ k2\n2\n(r)u2 = 0, (6)\nwhere k2\n2\n(r) = b\u2212a\u2032\/2\u2212a2\/4. Although k2\n2\ndiverges when\nE = V , \u03c72 is regular there. Since exp(\u2212\n\u222b\na(r)dr\/2) is\nnot an oscillatory function of r, u2 has the same charac-\nter as \u03c72. Eq. (6) shows that this character is oscillatory\nwhen k2\n2\nis positive and exponential when k2\n2\nis nega-\ntive. Asymptotic exponential decay is characteristic of\na bound state but here \u201cconfined\u201d is used to indicate a\nbound state that is localised near the centre of the dot.\nWhen V and A\u03b8 increase as power laws, the asymp-\ntotic form of k2\n2\nis (V0\/\u03b3)\n2r2s\u2212 (eA0\/h\u00af)\n2r2t. Hence k2\n2\nis\npositive when s > t, leading to oscillatory character and\ndeconfined states. And k2\n2\nis negative when s < t, leading\nto exponential character and confined states. However if\ns = t the asymptotic form is [(V0\/\u03b3)\n2 \u2212 (eA0\/h\u00af)\n2]r2t so\nthe sign of k2\n2\ndepends on V0 and A0 and a confinement-\ndeconfinement transition occurs when V 2\n0\n= (\u03b3eA0\/h\u00af)\n2.\nThis also follows from the uncoupled equation for \u03c71:\nthe corresponding k2-value, k2\n1\n6= k2\n2\nbut k2\n1\n\u2192 k2\n2\nin the\nasymptotic limit so \u03c71 and \u03c72 have the same character.\nTo investigate the states further, Eqs. (1) and (2) are\nsolved numerically. The Hamiltonian, H , satisfies\n\u222b R\n0\n\u222b\n2pi\n0\n[\u03c8\u2217\u03b1H\u03c8\u03b2 \u2212 (H\u03c8\u03b1)\n\u2217\u03c8\u03b2] d\u03b8rdr =\n\u22122pii\u03b3 [(\u03c7\u2217\n1\u03b1\u03c72\u03b2 + \u03c7\n\u2217\n2\u03b1\u03c71\u03b2)r]\nR\n0\n, (7)\nwhere \u03c8\u03b1 and \u03c8\u03b2 are two-component states of angular\nmomentum m and \u03c7i\u03b1,\u03c7i\u03b2 are the corresponding radial\nfunctions. Eqs. (1) and (2) lead to a Hermitian eigenvalue\nproblem when the boundary terms in Eq. (7) vanish. For\nthis to happen it is sufficient that one component is reg-\nular at the origin and one component vanishes at the\nboundary, R. Then it follows from Eqs. (1) and (2) that\nboth components are regular at the origin but it does not\nfollow that both components vanish at R. However a true\nbound state has an exponential tail so both components\nof a bound state vanish in the limit of large R. Hence\nconfined and deconfined states can be distinguished by\nsolving Eqs. (1) and (2) subject to the boundary con-\nditions that one component is regular at the origin and\none component vanishes at R and then looking for an\nexponential tail in both components.\nEqs. (1) and (2) are solved by discretizing them on\na uniform grid. By applying the time reversal operator\nto Eqs. (1) and (2) it can be shown that E(m,A0) =\nE(1\u2212m,\u2212A0). It is important to ensure that the eigen-\nvalues of the discretized Hamiltonian have the same prop-\nerty and this requires identical numbers of grid points for\nFIG. 1: Confined and deconfined states for cases when no\ntransition occurs. The frame above each state shows k2i . Top-\nmost frame: E(B) for s = 2, t = 1.\n\u03c71 and \u03c72. This excludes the use of centred differences\n[11] so d\/dr is approximated by the forward difference op-\nerator Lf or the backward difference operator Lb. The\nprocedure depends on m. When m \u2264 0, \u03c72(R) is cho-\nsen to vanish [12], Lf is used to find d\u03c72\/dr and Lb to\nfind d\u03c71\/dr and vice-versa when m \u2265 1. Although this\nguarantees that E(m,A0) = E(1 \u2212m,\u2212A0), it has the\ndisadvantage that numerical errors are linear in the step\nlength \u2206r. To compensate for this, \u2206r is kept small\nand all the eigenvalues computed in this work are accu-\nrate to about 1 part in 103, except for s = 2, t = 1 and\ns = 2, t = 2, where there are rapid oscillations but the ac-\ncuracy is still better than 2%. The discretization leads to\na non-Hermitian matrix eigenvalue problem. A similarity\ntransformation is used to reduce this to a real, symmetric\neigenvalue problem which is solved numerically.\nThe quantum states shown in the present work are all\nm = 1 states. Other states exhibit similar features, al-\nthough the amplitude of oscillations is m-dependent [7].\nSince the main focus of this work is on the confinement-\ndeconfinement transition, the states are selected so that\nthe behaviour at the origin does not change significantly\nwhen the potential parameters are changed. All the\n3FIG. 2: As Fig. 1 but for two cases which exhibit a\nconfinement-deconfinement transition.\nstates have been selected to have a large amplitude close\nto the origin and can be regarded as dot states. The ener-\ngies as a function of magnetic field typically show a series\nof anti-crossings (Fig. 1) and where necessary, the line of\nanti-crossings is followed to preserve the qualitative form\nof the state at the origin [13]. Every energy computed\nhere is between 26 and 67 meV, within the validity limit\nof the linear graphene Hamiltonian (\u2248 \u00b11 eV [1]).\nConfined and deconfined states are illustrated in Fig. 1.\nThe radial probability distribution, |fi|\n2 \u2261 r|\u03c7i|\n2, i = 1, 2\nis shown together with k2i . The insets show |fi|\n2 on a\nlogarithmic scale. R = 600 nm, large enough to en-\nsure that the asymptotic sign of k2i has been reached.\nThe magnetic field, B, is uniform. When s = 2, t = 1,\nV0 = 5 \u00d7 10\n\u22123 meV nm\u22122, the asymptotic sign of k2i is\npositive and the asymptotic character of |fi|\n2 is oscilla-\ntory independent of B. The amplitude of the oscillations\ndecreases with increasing B. When s = 0.5, t = 1, V0 = 5\nmeV nm\u22121\/2 and B 6= 0, the asymptotic sign of k2i is neg-\native and the asymptotic character of |fi|\n2 is exponential,\nas can be seen from the insets.\nThe confinement-deconfinement transition is illus-\ntrated in Fig. 2. R = 600 nm, again large enough to reach\nthe asymptotic regime. When s = 1, t = 1, V0 = 0.5 meV\nnm\u22121 andB = 0.3 T, the asymptotic sign of k2i is positive\nand the asymptotic character is oscillatory. In contrast,\nwhen B = 1.2 T, the asymptotic sign of k2i is negative\nand the asymptotic character is exponential.

Consequently, all the states of a graphene\ndot in a magnetic field have an exponential tail. How-\never, an effect similar to the confinement-deconfinement\ntransition occurs in the middle distance region between\nthe centre of the dot and the asymptotic regime.\nFor this transition to be observable, the dot level has to\nbe in the region of very low density of states between the\nbulk Landau levels. This requires a potential similar to\nthe one shown in Fig. 3. The asymptotic value of the po-\ntential is engineered to be just below the dot level. This\nputs the dot level between the zeroth and first Landau\nlevels. Thus the dot level can be isolated from the bulk\nLandau levels provided that they are narrow enough.\nThe required potential can be generated by gate elec-\ntrodes. One possible arrangement is a metal plate with\na circular hole that contains an electrode. The graphene\nsheet is above these electrodes on 300 nm of SiO2 on a\nback-gate at 0 V. The plate (-1 V) generates the asymp-\ntotically flat part of the potential, the hole generates the\nbarrier and the central electrode (-2 V) generates the\nwell. Similar gated, monolayer graphene nanostructures\nhave been fabricated recently [14]. The potential in Fig. 3\nwas computed by solving the Poisson equation on a dis-\ncrete mesh. Screening by the graphene sheet was treated\nin the Thomas-Fermi approximation [15]. The resulting\npotential is magnetic field dependent because the den-\nsity of states is field dependent. This causes steps in the\npotential (inset to Fig. 3) which occur when the num-\nber of occupied Landau levels changes. However the field\ndependence is weak at the low fields considered here.\nThe \u201cconfinement-deconfinement\u201d transition for the\npotential in Fig. 3 and a uniform magnetic field is shown\nin Fig. 4. For all fields, the states have a peak near the\ncentre of the dot and an exponential tail. The transition\noccurs in the middle distance region between these two\nfeatures, 200 <\u223c r\n<\n\u223c 400 nm.

As Fig. 2 but\nfor the potential shown in Fig. 3.\ngion can be identified by computing k2i . In Fig. 4, this\nvaries rapidly because of the steps in the potential but\nremains positive in the middle distance region when B =\n0.05 T. At this field, the oscillations in |fi|\n2 correspond to\nthose in Fig. 2 but are much less rapid because V , hence\nk2i is smaller. As the field increases the region of positive\nk2i shrinks and a transition to exponential behaviour oc-\ncurs. This is analogous to the change of character seen\nin the Klein paradox for relativistic particles with mass.\nThe occurrence of the transition is insensitive to the\nelectrode geometry. The one in Fig. 3 has the advantage\nthat the graphene is easy to access but may be difficult to\nfabricate. However, similar transitions occur in systems\nwith disk or spherical central electrodes with the plate\nand central electrode either above or below the graphene\nsheet. In addition, calculations for model potentials with\na well, barrier and flat portion show that the occurrence\nof the transition is insensitive to the model parameters.\nThe only requirement is a region where k2i changes sign\nwhen A0 increases. This is relatively easy to arrange.\n|fi|\n2 in Fig. 4 decreases by 3-4 orders of magnitude at\nr \u2248 300 nm when the character of the state changes from\noscillatory to exponential. This large effect could be used\nto probe the transition experimentally. For example, the\ndecrease in |fi|\n2 causes a decrease in the local density\nof states (LDOS) near the dot which could be detected\nwith scanning tunnelling microscopy. The decrease in\n|fi|\n2 would also cause a large decrease in the overlap of\nthe dot state with states in contacts at r \u2248 300 nm. This\ncould be detected by looking for a change in transport\nthrough the dot state via diametrically opposite contacts\nat r \u2248 300 nm. Numerical calculations of the LDOS for\nthe potential in Fig. 3 show that the state in Fig. 4 lies\nin a region of very low bulk density of states, with the\ndot state around 0.1-0.2 meV away from any other levels.\nThis suggests the dot state can be resolved experimen-\ntally in graphene samples of sufficient quality.\nIn summary, confined and deconfined states occur in\ngraphene dots in a magnetic field. The states are con-\nfined when the scalar potential rises slowly and decon-\nfined when it rises rapidly. But when the scalar and\nvector potentials have the same power law, the character\nof the states can be controlled at will and a confinement-\ndeconfinement transition occurs. A similar effect occurs\nin a realistic dot model. This is analogous to the relativis-\ntic Klein paradox and may be experimentally observable.\nThe proposed system may be attractive because it allows\ngraphene dots to be formed in a uniform magnetic field.\nIt is a pleasure to acknowledge useful discussions with\nProfessors H. Aoki, H. Fukuyama and S. Tarucha. This\nwork was supported by the UK Engineering and Physical\nSciences Research Council.\n[1] A. K. Geim and K. S. Novoselov, Nature Materials 6, 183\n(2007).\n[2] B.
