Introduction\nEnergetic electrons (\u2265 150 keV) in the Earth\u2019s radiation belts are distributed in two29\ndistinct regions. The inner belt (1.2-2 RE) is relatively stable and usually exhibits only30\nminor variability to solar-induced disturbances. In contrast, the outer belt (> 4RE) is31\nhighly variable, with flux changes exceeding an order of magnitude over periods as short as32\nan hour. Under quiet geomagnetic conditions, a pronounced \u201cslot\u201d or gap forms between33\nthe two belts (orbit 182 in the lower panel of Figure 1). The quiet-time slot is most pro-34\nnounced at energies above several hundred keV. The basic structure of the slot has been35\nexplained as a balance between slow inward radial diffusion from a source population in36\nthe outer zone and precipitation losses from the inner magnetosphere, primarily due to res-37\nonant scattering by plasmaspheric hiss [Lyons and Thorne, 1973] and other whistler-mode38\nwaves [Abel and Thorne, 1998a,b]. Owing to the long time-scales associated with radial39\ndiffusion in the inner magnetosphere, only electrons with energies below the minimum en-40\nergy for resonance with whistler-mode waves (or magnetic moments \u00b5 = p\u22a52\/2mB < 1041\nMev\/G) are able to diffuse into the inner zone without substantial loss.42\nDuring a geomagnetic storm, the flux of energetic electrons in the outer radiation zone43\nand the slot region can be substantially enhanced. Flux changes during the October44\n10, 1990 geomagnetic storm are shown in Figure 1. Pre-storm conditions (orbit 182)45\nexhibit a well-defined two-zone structure, with energetic (E \u2265 340 keV) electron flux46\ndrops exceeding 3 orders of magnitude in the center of the slot, 2.7 \u2264 L \u2264 3.5. The47\nCombined Release and Radiation Effects Satellite (CRRES) was ideally located to monitor48\nchanges in the radiation belts, and some of the important physical processes responsible49\nD R A F T February 9, 2007, 3:22pm D R A F T\nTHORNE ET AL.: STORM-TIME REFILLING OF ELECTRON SLOT X - 5\nfor variability in the outer zone (L \u2265 4) during this storm have been explored in previous50\nstudies [e.g., Brautigam and Albert, 2000; Meredith et al., 2002a,b; Summers et al., 2002;51\nHorne et al., 2003b; Liu et al., 2003; Iles et al., 2006]. We concentrate here on the52\nprocesses responsible for the rapid filling of the slot region (L \u223c 3) at energies above a53\nfew hundred keV, over a period of less than 9.5 hours, between the main phase of the54\nstorm (orbit 186) and the early recovery phase (orbit 187). Lower energy electrons (15355\nkeV channel) are rapidly injected into the slot region and outer belt during the main56\nphase of the storm, and remain at enhanced levels throughout the entire storm recovery.57\nIn contrast, higher energy electrons (340 and 510 keV channels) are slightly depleted58\n(near L = 3) during the main phase (orbit 186), but rapidly recover to levels well above59\nthe pre-storm values in the early recovery (orbit 187). The relative flux increase is most60\npronounced near the center of the quite-time slot. Interestingly, there is no evidence for a61\nflux increase at this location at energies above 1 MeV, although such relativistic electrons62\ndo show substantial increase in the outer radiation zone over the extended recovery phase63\nof the storm, as described by Meredith et al. [2002a]. Here we investigate the effectiveness64\nof three potential mechanisms to account for the rapid electron flux increases in the slot65\nregion, normally devoid of energetic electrons. A statistical analysis of slot region filling for66\nstorm-time conditions during the entire CRRES mission is also presented. The statistical67\nanalysis supports the general applicability of our case study, and we conclude with a68\ndiscussion of the dominant physical process responsible for electron variability in the slot69\nregion.70\nD R A F T February 9, 2007, 3:22pm D R A F T\nX - 6 THORNE ET AL.: STORM-TIME REFILLING OF ELECTRON SLOT\n2. Convective Transport from the Plasmasheet\nThe main phase of a magnetic storm is characterized by the development of an enhanced71\nand sustained convection electric field, which carries plasmasheet ions and electrons into72\nthe inner magnetosphere (leading to the formation of the storm-time ring current [e.g.,73\nDaglis et al., 1999]), and also leads to a redistribution of thermal plasma in the inner74\nmagnetosphere, specifically erosion and compression of the nightside plasmasphere and75\nthe development of a dayside plume [Goldstein et al., 2005]. Under purely adiabatic76\ntransport, conservation of the first adiabatic invariant (\u00b5) and total energy (\u00b5B + q\u03a6)77\nrequires that plasmasheet particles gain kinetic energy as they are injected into regions78\nof stronger magnetic field. Particle kinetic energy gain comes at the expense of a drop in79\nelectrostatic potential energy, which is limited by the strength of the convection electric80\nfield imposed across the magnetosphere. Liu et al. [2003] have simulated the convective81\ninjection of plasmasheet electrons into the inner magnetosphere, using a realistic model82\nfor the storm-time electric field. Their simulations adequately account for the observed83\ninjection of ring current electrons at energies below 150 keV during the October 199084\nstorm, but they were unable to explain the injection of higher energy electrons into the85\nregion 3 \u2264 L \u2264 5. This difference is primarily due to the large gradient drift of higher86\nenergy electrons, which prevents them from penetrating into the region inside L \u223c 5.87\nFigure 2 shows the drift paths of electrons with \u00b5 = 3 and 30 MeV\/G in a dipole magnetic88\nfield and a Volland-Stern electric field [Volland, 1973; Stern, 1975] under both quiet (left89\npanels, \u2206\u03a6 = 25 kV) and storm-time (right panels, \u2206\u03a6 = 200 kV) conditions, where \u2206\u03a690\nis the total potential drop across the magnetosphere. The storm-time enhancement of the91\nconvection electric field allows thermal (3 MeV\/G) plasmasheet electrons to penetrate92\nD R A F T February 9, 2007, 3:22pm D R A F T\nTHORNE ET AL.: STORM-TIME REFILLING OF ELECTRON SLOT X - 7\ninto L \u2248 3 near dawn. During the inward transport, the electron energy rises from \u223c 193\nkeV at L = 10 to typical ring current energies \u223c 30 keV at L = 3. In contrast, higher94\nenergy (30 MeV\/G) plasmasheet electrons are only able to penetrate to L \u223c 5, where95\ntheir energies are \u223c 70 keV. Modeling by Liu et al. [2003], using realistic fluctuations of96\nthe convection electric field during the main phase of the October 1990 storm, indicates97\nthat additional radial diffusive transport also occurs, but only electrons below 150 keV98\nare able to be injected into the region between 3 \u2264 L \u2264 5. The rapid enhancement in99\n300-500 keV electron flux must therefore be due to a different process.100\n3. Inward Radial Diffusion\nEnhanced ULF wave activity during magnetic storms [Mathie and Mann, 2000] can\ncause inward radial diffusion and an associated increase in energetic electron flux [Elking-\nton et al., 2003; Shprits et al., 2005]. Temporal changes in energetic electron phase space\ndensity f can be modeled using the radial diffusion equation [Schulz and Lanzerotti, 1974]\n\u2202f\n\u2202t\n= L2\n\u2202\n\u2202L\n(\nDLL\nL2\n\u2202f\n\u2202L\n)\n\u2212 f\n\u03c4\n, (1)\nwhere the first term on the right is due to radial diffusion and the second term represents\nlosses. DLL is the radial diffusion coefficient and \u03c4 is the loss time-scale. The radial\nprofile of phase space density is controlled by the competition between diffusive transport\nand loss [Thorne, 1982]. The diffusion coefficient DLL is usually represented as a sum of\ncoefficients for magneticDMLL and electrostaticD\nE\nLL field fluctuations. An empirical scaling\nof DLL, for different levels of the geomagnetic activity index Kp, has been obtained from\nsatellite data and shows that DMLL > D\nE\nLL for L \u2265 3 [Brautigam and Albert, 2000]. For\nD R A F T February 9, 2007, 3:22pm D R A F T\nX - 8 THORNE ET AL.: STORM-TIME REFILLING OF ELECTRON SLOT\n1 \u2264 Kp \u2264 6, the magnetic diffusion coefficient can be expressed as\nDMLL = 10\n(0.506Kp\u22129.325)L10day\u22121. (2)\nAlthough the rate of radial diffusion becomes much weaker at smaller L, enhanced ULF\nwave activity during the main phase of a storm and strong gradients in phase space density\ninside L \u223c 4 could still facilitate the transport of energetic outer zone electrons into lower\nL [e.g., Shprits and Thorne, 2004]. To investigate the effectiveness of this process, we\nhave performed a time-dependent simulation of anticipated inward diffusion over a 10\nhour period (between CRRES orbits 186 and 187), during the early recovery phase of the\nOctober 1990 storm. Since measured flux at higher L shells varies significantly during\nthe main phase due to adiabatic effects [Kim and Chan, 1997], we chose to start our\nsimulation with a steady state profile computed for conditions with Kp = 6 and \u03c4 = 1\nday. The radial flux profile obtained (solid line in Figure 3) gives an adequate fit to the\nobserved flux at 340 keV at higher L shells (on orbit 187) and mimics the pronounced\ndrop observed on orbit 186 in the region L < 4, where adiabatic effects become negligible.\nThis starting condition provides a liberal estimate of the source population for subsequent\ninward radial diffusion. Throughout the simulation we adopt an inner boundary condition\nf = 0 at L = 1. The outer boundary condition (at L=7) is modeled by an exponential fit\nto the average flux measured on CRRES:\nJ(K,L = 7) = 8222.6exp(\u22127.068K)cm\u22122sr\u22121keV \u22121s\u22121, (3)\nwhere K is the kinetic energy in MeV. The rate of radial diffusion is computed using101\nexpression (2) and measured Kp values. Particle lifetimes are assumed to be 100 days.102\nFollowing Shprits et al. [2005], we solve for the normalized phase space density f(L)103\nD R A F T February 9, 2007, 3:22pm D R A F T\nTHORNE ET AL.: STORM-TIME REFILLING OF ELECTRON SLOT X - 9\nat a fixed magnetic moment, and use the boundary condition (3) to obtain differential104\nflux J(K,L) at a fixed kinetic energy. The modeled electron flux at 340 keV is shown105\nat intervals of five (dash dot) and 10 (dashed) hours into the simulation. Even with106\nthis conservative loss-free assumption, inward radial diffusion is unable to account for the107\ndramatic flux increase in high energy electron flux observed throughout the slot region108\nbetween CRRES orbits 186 (storm main phase) and 187 (early recovery). However, elec-109\ntrons present near the inner edge of the outer zone can be transported inward by about110\n0.3 RE over a 10 hour interval. This conclusion is relatively insensitive to the adopted111\nlifetime parameter (unless \u03c4 \u2264 10 hours).112\n4. Local Acceleration During Interactions with Chorus Emission\nThe time history of geomagnetic activity (AE and Kp in the upper panels of Figure113\n1) indicates that sustained but impulsive convection occurred throughout the recovery114\nphase of the storm [Meredith et al., 2002a]. This convection led to the episodic injec-115\ntion of thermal plasmasheet electrons into the low density region outside the storm-time116\nplasmapause. During the main (and early recovery) phase of the storm, the plasmapause117\nwas eroded and compressed well inside L=3, and strong whistler-mode chorus emissions118\nwere observed in the low-density region exterior to the dawn-side plasmapause (top panel119\nof Figure 1). Whistler-mode chorus can interact with electrons over a broad energy range,120\nleading to scattering in both pitch-angle and energy [Horne and Thorne, 1998; Summers121\net al., 1998]. Enhanced inward convection (section 2) provides a seed population of 10 keV122\nto \u223c 100 keV electrons throughout the region exterior to the storm-time plasmapause.123\nConservation of the first two adiabatic invariants leads to anisotropic electron distribu-124\ntions with T\u22a5 > T\u2016 (where T\u22a5 and T\u2016 are temperatures perpendicular and parallel to the125\nD R A F T February 9, 2007, 3:22pm D R A F T\nX - 10 THORNE ET AL.: STORM-TIME REFILLING OF ELECTRON SLOT\nambient magnetic field, respectively) during inward transport. The anisotropic electron126\ndistributions provide the source of free energy for the excitation of whistler-mode chorus127\nwaves at frequencies below the electron gyrofrequency [e.g., Horne et al., 2003c]. Waves128\ngrow by scattering particles into the loss cone at small pitch-angles [Kennel and Petschek,129\n1966], but they also scatter electrons to higher energies at large pitch-angles [Horne and130\nThorne, 2003]. The net result is a local transfer of energy between the injected ring current131\n(10-100 keV) electrons and relativistic electrons using chorus waves as an intermediary.132\nThis local acceleration is most effective in regions where the ratio of the electron plasma133\nfrequency to the cyclotron frequency (fpe\/fce) is small, typically less than 4 [Horne et al.,134\n2003a, 2005a]. Low values of fpe\/fce increase the phase velocity of the waves and enable135\nmore effective energy diffusion in locations just outside the plasmapause. Energy diffu-136\nsion, leading to a hardening of the electron energy spectrum, should continue as long as137\nchorus waves are excited and the ratio of fpe\/fce remains low. Recent studies have shown138\nthat local acceleration by chorus emissions can account for the gradual buildup of outer139\nzone relativistic electron flux over a period comparable to a few days in the recovery phase140\nof storms [Summers et al., 2002; Horne et al., 2005a,b; Thorne et al.. 2005a; Shprits et141\nal., 2006a]. The local wave acceleration process can be distinguished from inward radial142\ndiffusion, since it naturally leads to a gradual build-up of localized peaks in phase space143\ndensity [Green and Kivelson, 2004; Iles et al., 2006].144\nLocal acceleration by chorus emissions should also have been effective in the slot re-145\ngion (near L=3), during the early recovery phase of the October 1990 storm, since the146\nplasmapause remained compressed inside this location and intense chorus emissions were147\nobserved in the region exterior to L \u223c 2.7 (top panel of Figure 1 and lower panel of148\nD R A F T February 9, 2007, 3:22pm D R A F T\nTHORNE ET AL.: STORM-TIME REFILLING OF ELECTRON SLOT X - 11\nFigure 4). The CRRES observations on orbit 186 were taken at relatively high latitude,149\nwell away from the expected wave excitation region near the equator. Ray tracing studies150\nshow that waves excited with field-aligned propagation vectors tend to migrate outwards151\nto slightly higher L during propagation to higher latitude [Horne and Thorne, 2003]. To152\naccount for this cross field propagation we average over a narrow range of L values, to153\nobtain an estimate of the power spectral intensity of chorus emissions at various locations154\nin the slot region.155\nChorus emissions are typically observed over a broad MLT range (2300-1400), with156\nan intensity primarily controlled by the level of geomagnetic activity [Meredith et al.,157\n2001]. A statistical analysis of chorus emissions during storm conditions [Meredith et158\nal., 2003a] indicates that the most intense waves in the midnight sector (\u223c 2400 MLT)159\nare confined to latitudes within 10 \u223c 15 degrees of the equator, while chorus in the160\npost dawn quadrant (0600-1200 MLT) extends to much higher latitudes (\u2265 30o). During161\nthe main and early recovery phase of the October storm the geomagnetic activity index162\nremained high (Kp \u2265 5), and the variation in chorus intensity illustrated in the top panel163\nof Figure 1 is primarily associated with changes in the magnetic latitude and MLT during164\nsuccessive passes of the CRRES spacecraft through the magnetosphere. All outbound165\npasses through the slot region (2.5 \u2264 L \u2264 4.0) occurred near midnight, while the inbound166\npasses occurred in the post-dawn sector [Meredith et al., 2002b]. Furthermore, the night167\nside outbound pass during orbit 186 was made at a latitude (\u03bbm \u2265 15\u25e6) where chorus168\nis subject to severe Landau damping [Bortnik et al., 2007], consistent with the observed169\nstatistical distribution [Meredith et al., 2003a]. In contrast, measurements of chorus on170\nthe inbound dayside pass (on orbit 186) were made at a latitude near 21 \u2212 22\u25e6, where171\nD R A F T February 9, 2007, 3:22pm D R A F T\nX - 12 THORNE ET AL.: STORM-TIME REFILLING OF ELECTRON SLOT\nchorus emissions are expected to be most intense [Meredith et al., 2003a]. Consequently,172\nin the modeling described below, we assume that the local measurements of chorus power173\nspectral intensity obtained on the inbound dayside pass (orbit 186) are representative of174\nemissions over the entire dawn-side during the period of electron acceleration in the early175\nrecovery phase of the storm.176\nThe spectral intensity of lower band chorus emissions, observed on the inbound orbit177\n186 of CRRES at locations 3.35 \u2265 L \u2264 3.55 are shown in the middle panel of Figure178\n4 as a function of wave frequency normalized to the equatorial gyro-frequency fce . A179\nleast squares Gaussian fit (red), with Bw = 46.2 pT , peak frequency fm = 0.29fce, and180\nbandwidth \u03b4f = 0.11fce was obtained to the average spectral intensity of chorus in the181\nouter slot (green). Corresponding fits to the spectral intensity for 3.05 \u2265 L \u2264 3.25182\nare shown in the top panel. The trough density model of Sheeley et al. [2001], and a183\ndipole magnetic field was used to estimate the ratio of fpe\/fce at the equator, and the184\ndensity was assumed to be constant with latitude. Electron scattering is assumed to185\noccur over a latitude range \u221215o < \u03bbm < 15o between 2400-0600 MLT and over a range186\n\u221235o < \u03bbm < 35o between 0600-1200 MLT. Gaussian fits to the spectra observed on the187\ndayside (Figure 4), together with the adopted latitudinal distributions, were then used188\nto computed the bounce and drift-averaged rates of pitch-angle \u3008D\u03b1\u03b1\u3009 and momentum189\ndiffusion \u3008Dpp\u3009 at L = 3.35 (Figure 5) and L = 3.05 (not shown), using a simplified190\nquasi-linear code developed at UCLA [Shprits et al., 2006b]. Since the bounce-averaged191\npitch-angle and energy diffusion coefficients, obtained under the simplifying assumption192\nof field-aligned propagation, agree well [Shprits et al., 2006b] with exact calculations with193\nthe PADIE code [Glauert and Horne, 2005], in which the wave energy is distributed over194\nD R A F T February 9, 2007, 3:22pm D R A F T\nTHORNE ET AL.: STORM-TIME REFILLING OF ELECTRON SLOT X - 13\na range of wave normal angles, we adopt the simpler field-aligned scattering model for our195\nanalysis.196\nTemporal evolution of the electron phase space density was then obtained from a nu-\nmerical integration of a simplified Fokker-Planck equation in which cross (momentum and\npitch-angle) diffusion terms were ignored.\n\u2202f\n\u2202t\n=\n1\nyT\n\u2202\n\u2202y\n(\nyT \u3008Dyy\u3009\u2202f\n\u2202y\n)\n+\n1\np2\n\u2202\n\u2202p\n(\np2\u3008Dpp\u3009\u2202f\n\u2202p\n)\n\u2212RL (4)\nHere y = sin\u03b1eq, RL is the loss rate, and T (\u03b1eq) = 1.3802\u2212 0.3198(y+ y1\/2). The bounce\naveraged diffusion coefficient \u3008Dyy\u3009 may be related to the bounce averaged pitch-angle\ndiffusion coefficient \u3008D\u03b1\u03b1\u3009 [Shprits et al., 2006b] by\n\u3008Dyy\u3009 =\n(\n1\u2212 y2\n)\n\u3008D\u03b1\u03b1\u3009. (5)\nEquation (4) may be simplified further by considering diffusion in pitch-angle and energy\nseparately. The temporal evolution of the pitch-angle distribution can be obtained from\n\u2202f\n\u2202t\n=\n1\nyT (y)\n\u2202\n\u2202y\n(\nyT (y)\u3008Dyy\u3009\u2202f\n\u2202y\n)\n\u2212 f\n\u03c4\u03b1\n, (6)\nwhere the electron loss time \u03c4\u03b1 is equated to the electron quarter bounce-time inside the\nloss cone and set to infinity outside the loss cone. Boundary conditions for solution of\nequation (5) are \u2202f\/\u2202\u03b1 = 0 at \u03b1 = 90\u25e6, and f = 0 at \u03b1 = 0\u25e6. Exponential decay of the\nmodeled electron distribution function f(\u03b1, p) yields the precipitation lifetime \u03c4p(E) due\nto scattering into the atmosphere. Temporal changes in the energy spectrum can then be\nobtained from the 1-D momentum diffusion equation\n\u2202f\n\u2202t\n=\n1\np2\n\u2202\n\u2202p\n(\np2\u3008Dpp\u3009\u2202f\n\u2202p\n)\n\u2212 f\n\u03c4p(E)\n(7)\nwhere \u3008Dpp\u3009 is also averaged over equatorial pitch-angle.197\nD R A F T February 9, 2007, 3:22pm D R A F T\nX - 14 THORNE ET AL.: STORM-TIME REFILLING OF ELECTRON SLOT\nSolutions of equation (7) provide a realistic simulation of the temporal evolution of198\nnearly equatorial particles. CRRES data from orbit 186 was used for our starting condition199\n(diamond symbols in Figure 6). The seed population (\u2264 150 keV), provided by inward200\nconvection (section 2), was observed to change between orbits 186 and 187 (Figure 1).201\nTo account for this, the lower boundary flux in our simulation (at 153 keV) was allowed202\nto gradually increase linearly in time. Flux at the upper boundary (15 MeV) was set to203\nzero. Solutions obtained for the electron phase space density were subsequently converted204\nto differential flux J = p2f [Rossi and Olbert, 1970] to obtain the evolution of the energy205\nspectrum at L=3.35 (Figure 6a) after 5 hours (dot-dash) and 10 hours (dash). The206\nmodeled distribution above 300 keV, ten hours into the simulation, agree remarkably207\nwell with CRRES observations on orbit 187 (triangles). Our simulation indicates that208\nlocal chorus-induced acceleration was a dominant process leading to the enhancement209\nin energetic electron flux in the region normally identified with the slot during the early210\nrecovery phase of the October, 1990 storm. The model results yield little change in the flux211\nof MeV electrons, due to the much smaller energy diffusion rates at higher energies (Figure212\n5). Corresponding simulation at L = 3.05 (Figure 6b) indicate that wave acceleration213\nalone, based on the local CRRES measurements, cannot account for flux increases in the214\ninner slot. Average wave amplitudes would have to be considerably higher (\u223c 37 pT as215\nindicated by the dotted line) than the local measurements to match CRRES observations.216\nIt is more likely that flux enhancements near L \u223c 3 is due to the combined effect of rapid217\nlocal acceleration near L \u223c 3.3 (Figure 6a), followed by modest (\u2206L \u223c 0.3) inward radial218\ndiffusion (e.g. Figure 3), but a 3D diffusion simulation will be needed to confirm this.219\nD R A F T February 9, 2007, 3:22pm D R A F T\nTHORNE ET AL.: STORM-TIME REFILLING OF ELECTRON SLOT X - 15\n5. Statistical Analysis of Slot Region Filling\nAlthough the simulations described above indicate that local wave acceleration provides220\nan effective mechanism to explain energetic electron flux enhancements in the slot region221\nduring the early recovery phase of the October 1990 geomagnetic storm, it is important222\nto investigate the viability of this process during other storms. To address this issue we223\nhave undertaken a statistical analysis of changes in the energetic electron population,224\nand corresponding changes in the intensity of chorus emissions, and the ratio of fpe\/fce225\n(which controls the rate of energy diffusion) during storm conditions compared to quiet226\ntimes. We identify storm conditions (when strong convective activity maintains the source227\npopulation of low-energy electron for chorus excitation) using the magnetic activity index228\nAEmax > 500 nT over the preceding 3 hours. For quiet times, we adopt AEmax < 100 nT229\nover the preceding 3 hours. Statistical properties of the perpendicular energetic electron230\nflux J\u22a5(L,MLT ) obtained from the MEA instrument over the entire CRRES mission231\nare shown in Figure 7. Under quiet conditions, the presence of the slot between the232\ninner and outer radiation belts becomes readily apparent at energies above 300 keV. The233\ncorresponding intensity of chorus emissions and the ratio fpe\/fce are shown in Figure234\n8. Enhanced chorus emissions are observed in association with low values of the ratio235\nfpe\/fce outside the plasmasphere in the MLT region from 23:00 to 14:00. To emphasize236\nchanges during storm conditions, we plot the ratio of the electron flux for AEmax > 500237\nnT compared to that for AEmax < 100 nT in the top two panels of Figure 9. The238\nstorm to quiet time ratio of the wave intensity and of fpe\/fce is shown in the lower two239\npanels. During storm conditions the inner zone is essentially unaffected, but there are240\nlarge increases in energetic electron flux throughout the outer zone and slot region. The241\nD R A F T February 9, 2007, 3:22pm D R A F T\nX - 16 THORNE ET AL.: STORM-TIME REFILLING OF ELECTRON SLOT\ndawn-dusk asymmetry in 153 keV electron flux is probably due to the influence of the242\nenhanced storm-time convection electric field, but azimuthal gradient drifting removes243\nsuch effects at 340 keV. The largest storm-time to quiet-time ratio at 340 keV is found244\nwithin the slot region L \u223c 3. During storm conditions, the intensity of whistler mode245\nchorus emissions is dramatically enhanced throughout the region exterior to the storm-246\ntime plasmapause over an MLT range between 2300-1400. The dawn-side plasmapause is247\nalso compressed to L values \u223c between 2 and 3, leading to a pronounced decrease in the248\nratio fpe\/fce in the region normally identified with the quiet-time slot. The combination249\nof low density and high wave intensity provide the requisite conditions for local wave250\nacceleration.251\n6. Discussion\nThe process described in section 4, for local wave acceleration of energetic electrons252\n(> 150 keV) in the region just outside the storm-time plasmapause (L \u2265 3), should253\nalso be effective for enhancing the energetic electron flux in the slot region in the early254\nrecovery phase of other geomagnetic storms (section 5). Statistical analysis of the prop-255\nerties of chorus emissions indicates the presence of enhanced waves throughout the region256\nexterior to the plasmapause [Meredith et al., 2001, 2003a] in association with sustained257\nconvective injection [Meredith et al., 2002b]. The energy diffusion rate (Figure 5) and258\nhence the time-scale for local acceleration is strongly dependent on plasma density and259\nwave properties, and on the energy of resonant electrons. At energies exceeding an MeV,260\ntypical acceleration times normally exceed several days [Horne et al., 2005a]. With the261\ncessation of the strong convective injection, associated with the development of the ion262\nring current during the storm main phase, the boundary of convective injection moves to263\nD R A F T February 9, 2007, 3:22pm D R A F T\nTHORNE ET AL.: STORM-TIME REFILLING OF ELECTRON SLOT X - 17\nhigher L, and the plasmapause moves outwards. Enhancement of plasma density near264\nL \u223c 3 in the recovery phase of moderate geomagnetic storms effectively terminates the265\nwave acceleration process before electrons can be accelerated to energies above 1 MeV.266\nThe wave acceleration process can still continue to operate at higher L (in the heart of267\nthe outer radiation zone), as long as chorus is excited by sustained substorm injection, as268\nobserved during the extended recovery of the October 1990 storm.269\nDuring more extreme magnetic storms, both radial diffusion and local wave acceleration270\ncan contribute to relativistic electron flux enhancements in the slot region. Loto\u2019aniu et271\nal. [2006] have evaluated the rate of radial diffusion by intense ULF waves on October 29,272\n2003 at the onset of the Halloween storm, and shown that drift resonant acceleration can273\noccur in the slot region near L \u223c 2 over a time-scale of 24 hours. However, the most intense274\nelectron acceleration during the Halloween storm occurred over a period of 3-4 days, well275\nafter the cessation of enhanced ULF wave activity [Horne et al., 2005b]. The Halloween276\nstorm was unique in that the plasmapause moved well inside L = 2 and remained at low277\nL for several days, allowing chorus wave acceleration to continue to accelerate electrons278\nto energies above 3 MeV, producing a new radiation belt peaked at L = 2.5 [Horne et al.,279\n2005b; Shprits et al., 2006a]. Local wave acceleration could also account for the delayed280\ninjection of > 2 MeV electrons into the slot region in the extended recovery phase of281\nmore intense geomagnetic storms with Dstmin < -130 nT [Zheng et al., 2006]. However,282\nover the typical three day acceleration period between Dstmin and observed flux peaks in283\nthe slot region, one cannot discount the contribution of radial diffusion to the injection284\nprocess. The wave intensities observed on CRRES during the October 1990 storm (Figure285\n4) were relatively modest. Stronger chorus intensities (\u2265 100 pT), together with enhanced286\nD R A F T February 9, 2007, 3:22pm D R A F T\nX - 18 THORNE ET AL.: STORM-TIME REFILLING OF ELECTRON SLOT\nradial diffusion, could possibly account for the rapid (on time scales \u223c hours) injection of287\nrelativistic electrons into the slot region during major geomagnetic storms [Nagai et al.,288\n2006]. However, 3D modeling will be needed to clarify the relative importance of the two289\nacceleration processes during such intense events.290\nThe wave acceleration process described above indicates that the temporal history of the291\nlocation of the plasmapause and the duration of enhanced convective activity (and result-292\ning wave excitation), both of which are controlled by solar wind variability, may determine293\nwhy some storms are effective electron accelerators, while others are not [Reeves et al.,294\n2003]. Losses also play a controlling role, particularly during the main phase of a storm,295\nwhen the rate of precipitation loss can exceed the rate of acceleration. Although chorus296\nemissions cause microburst precipiation [O\u2019Brien et al., 2004; Thorne et al., 2005b], the297\nnet rate of loss is smaller than the rate of local acceleration for relativistic energies [Horne298\net al., 2005a]. However, electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves, excited by the injection of299\nring current ions, can cause rapid precipitation loss of electrons above \u223c 500 keV on time-300\nscales of a few hours [Thorne and Kennel, 1971; Lyons and Thorne, 1972; Albert, 2003;301\nSummers and Thorne, 2003; Meredith et al., 2003b; Bortnik et al., 2006]. The presence of302\nEMIC waves, either near the plasmapause or within dayside plumes, contributes to the303\ninability of MeV electrons to be injected into the slot region during normal storms, in304\ncontrast to electrons below \u223c 500 keV which are unable to resonate with such waves.305\nAcknowledgments.
