INTRODUCTION\nGrowth of Internet traffic and e-commerce are demanding\nhigh-speed transmission lines. Recent studies have dem-\nonstrated that dispersion management is one of the prom-\nising techniques for high-speed data transmission in\nfiber-optic links.1 Dispersion-compensating techniques\nutilize compensating elements such as dispersion-\ncompensating fibers (DCFs), optical phase conjugation,\nand chirped fiber gratings (CFGs). In terrestrial sys-\ntems, many transmission lines have already been in-\nstalled under ground, and the cost of upgrading such sys-\ntems to dispersion-managed (DM) systems is quite\nexpensive. The economic and simple way is to insert\nlumped dispersion compensators at amplifier locations.\nCFGs are effective lumped dispersive elements because of\ntheir compact sizes, high bandwidth times dispersion fig-\nure of merit, the capability to compensate higher-order\ndispersion, low insertion loss, and the absence of nonlin-\near effects. It has been shown that solitons exist in DM\nfiber transmission systems utilizing ideal CFGs for dis-\npersion compensation, and the transmission speed can be\nup to 100 Gbits\/s.2,3\nChirped fiber gratings (CFGs), however, have group-\ndelay ripples (GDR) that are the result of imperfections\nformed during the fabrication of gratings. The GDR in-\nduce side peaks in the pulse profile as shown in Fig. 1. In\nthe absence of nonlinearity, the amplitudes of these side\npeaks grow each time the pulse passes through a CFG.\nThe side peaks cause intersymbol interference and de-\ngrade the transmission system performance.4,5 In CFG-\ncompensated DM soliton systems, the growth of these\nside peaks is suppressed.6 For return-to-zero transmis-\nsion experiments with CFGs as the dispersion compensa-\ntor, with 10 Gbits\/s over 2900 km,7 4 3 10 Gbits\/s over\n800 km,8 16 3 20 Gbits\/s over 400 km,9 and 40 Gbits\/s\nover 500 km,10 have already been reported. A design for0740-3224\/2004\/040706-13$15.00 \u00a9light traffic conditions at a 40-Gbits\/s transmission with\nCFGs has been investigated by numerical simulations.11\nThe first step to set up any DM soliton system is to de-\nsign the transmission lines in terms of the dispersion map\nlength, fiber, and pulse parameters. To date, there is no\ncompletely analytical method to find soliton solutions for\nCFG-compensated DM soliton systems. We can, how-\never, obtain the numerical soliton solutions by the com-\nmonly used numerical averaging method12,13 in which the\npulse temporal data at two extrema of the slow dynamics\nin the evolution of the pulse parameter (amplitude or\nwidth) during pulse propagation in the DM soliton system\nare averaged. The averaging procedure is repeated until\na stable soliton solution of the DM soliton system is ob-\ntained. This numerical averaging technique is widely\nused in the design of DM soliton systems compensated by\nDCFs, and it can also be used in DM soliton systems with\nCFGs as dispersion compensators. The averaging\nmethod, however, starts with an arbitrary initial pulse\nwidth and energy, and the initial pulse may not converge\nto a stable soliton solution. It is therefore difficult to ob-\ntain a stable solution for the desired pulse width and en-\nergy simultaneously. In general, system engineers are\ninterested in designing DM soliton systems for a given bit\nrate (hence the pulse width) and initial pulse energy from\nthe available laser source. One can use the averaging al-\ngorithm to perform a massive study, but the process can\nbe time-consuming.\nIn addition to the numerical methods, an efficient way\nto describe the pulse dynamics in a DM soliton system is\nby variational analysis.14,15 With a suitable ansatz, one\ncan derive a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs)\ngoverning the evolution of the pulse parameters in DM\nsoliton systems. Typically, the set of coupled ODEs has\nto be solved numerically. Numerical solutions of these\nODEs are not only useful to describe the dynamics of the2004 Optical Society of America\nKwan et al. Vol. 21, No. 4 \/April 2004 \/J. Opt. Soc. Am. B 707DM solitons, but also to derive the parameters of the\nstable DM soliton in any given DM transmission systems.\nResults can be obtained much faster by this semianalytic\nmethod than by full simulations with the numerical aver-\naging method. Nakkeeran et al.16 presented a com-\npletely analytical procedure that used a variational ap-\nproach to design DM soliton systems compensated by\nDCFs. The length of the fiber segments in a two-step dis-\npersion map can be calculated explicitly for any given\npulse (width and energy) and fiber (dispersion and non-\nlinearity) parameters. They have also shown that the\nanalytical design procedure can be applied to DM soliton\nsystems with loss and gain. Using the variational analy-\nsis, Poutrina and Agrawal17 proposed design guidelines\nfor a given two-step DM soliton system. They can obtain\nthe input pulse width, chirp, and energy for any given dis-\npersion map parameters in DM soliton systems. We\nhave shown that the variational analysis can also be ap-\nplied to design DM soliton systems compensated by\nCFGs.18 For a set of given parameters of a dispersion\nmap in any grating-compensated DM soliton system, the\nrequired input pulse widths and energies can be found ex-\nplicitly from that semianalytical design procedure. We\nhave also shown that, in a CFG-compensated DM soliton\nsystem with loss and gain, we can adjust the location of\nthe grating in the dispersion map to a chirp-free position\nand obtain the desired input pulse parameters for the\nsystem.18 Here, we consider the inverse problem, that is,\nto find the dispersion map parameters for any given fiber\nand pulse parameters in such systems.\nIn this paper we present an efficient analytical method\nto design the dispersion map for a given pulse (energy and\nwidth) and fiber (dispersion and nonlinearity) parameters\nin any DM soliton communication system compensated by\nCFGs. The gratings are modeled as lumped dispersion\ncompensators without GDR. Using a Gaussian ansatz in\nthe variational analysis, we derive the pulse evolution\nequations. Then we obtain the analytical expressions to\ncalculate the grating dispersion and dispersion map\nlength by solving the evolution equations for the given\npulse and fiber parameters. We also extend this analyti-\ncal method to design systems with loss and gain. It is\ndifficult to include the side peaks caused by GDR in the\nvariational analysis. However, because the side peaks do\nFig. 1. Temporal pulse profile of solitons in grating-\ncompensated DM soliton systems with GDR.not significantly affect the dynamics of a single DM soli-\nton, our analytical procedure can be used to design DM\nsoliton systems compensated by CFGs with GDR.6 The\nresults obtained from our analytical method are in good\nagreement with those obtained with the numerical aver-\naging method even in the presence of GDR in the grat-\nings. Finally, we report the transmission performance of\na 160-Gbits\/s CFG-compensated DM soliton system de-\nsigned by the proposed analytical method.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we de-\nrive the expressions of grating dispersion and dispersion\nmap length for given fiber and pulse parameters in loss-\nless DM fiber systems. In Section 3 we extend the design\nmethod to a lossy DM fiber system with a map length\nequal to and shorter than the amplifier spacing. In Sec-\ntion 4 we study the effect of GDR in DM fiber systems.\nIn Section 5 a 160-Gbits\/s transmission system is simu-\nlated with all the important higher-order effects to show\nthe effectiveness of our analytical design. We draw our\nconclusion in Section 6.\n2. METHOD FOR DESIGNING CHIRPED\nFIBER GRATING-COMPENSATED\nLOSSLESS DISPERSION-MANAGED\nSOLITON SYSTEMS\nNakkeeran et al.16 have considered the ODEs derived\nfrom the variational analysis14,15 of a DCF-compensated\nDM soliton system. In that study, by solving the ODEs\ngoverning the evolution of the pulse width and chirp, the\nauthors derived an analytic expression for the anomalous\nand normal dispersion fiber lengths in terms of other fiber\n(group-velocity dispersion and Kerr coefficients) and\npulse (energy, minimum, and maximum widths) param-\neters. Hence one can calculate the required dispersion\nmap length for the periodic evolution of a Gaussian pulse\nwith a given width and energy. Here we use a similar\nprocedure to derive the explicit analytic expressions for\nthe fiber length and grating dispersion in a DM soliton\nsystem compensated by CFG.\nThe dynamics of a pulse propagating in an optical fiber\nunder the influence of the Kerr nonlinearity and periodi-\ncally varying dispersion is governed by the nonlinear\nSchro\u00a8dinger equation:\ni\n]c\n]z\n2\nb~z !\n2\n]2c\n]t2\n1 gu cu2c 5 0, (1)\nwhere c is the slowly varying envelope of the axial elec-\ntrical field; and z, t, b(z), and g represent the normalized\ndistance, normalized time, group-velocity dispersion, and\nself-phase modulation parameters, respectively. The\ngroup-velocity dispersion parameter b(z) 5 b for z \u00de (n\n1 1\/2)L, where n is an integer and L is the dispersion\nmap length. The gratings are located at z 5 (n\n1 1\/2)L and their actions are given by the transfer func-\ntion F(v) such that cout(z, v) 5 F(v)c in(z, v), where v\nis the angular frequency and c in and cout are the pulse\nspectra before and after the gratings. The CFGs have\nGDR that are the result of the imperfections in the grat-\ning manufacturing processes. The GDR will introduce\nside peaks in the pulse profile as shown in Fig. 1.5,6\n708 J. Opt. Soc. Am. B\/Vol. 21, No. 4 \/April 2004 Kwan et al.It is difficult to include these side peaks in the pulse an-\nsatz of the pulse evolution equations by use of the varia-\ntional principle. The effect of GDR is to modify the grat-\ning dispersion.6 The ripple period of GDR in CFGs can\nbe as small as 10 pm, which is much shorter than the sig-\nnal bandwidth in most practical cases. When the signal\nbandwidth is larger than the ripple period, the effect of\nGDR is small and the effective grating dispersion is equal\nto the mean grating dispersion.6 We therefore neglect\nthe effect of the ripples in the variational analysis. We\nstudy the effect of GDR in Section 4. The grating filter\ntransfer function is modeled as\nF~v! 5 expS igv22 D , (2)\nwhere g is the average lumped dispersion of the grating.6\nEquations (1) and (2) can be solved by the variational\nmethod. We choose a Gaussian ansatz:\nq~z, t ! 5 x1 expH 2~t 2 x2!2\nx3\n2\n1 iFx4~t 2 x2!22 1 x5~t 2 x2! 1 x6G J , (3)\nwhere x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 , and x6 depend on z and corre-\nspond to the amplitude, temporal position, width, qua-\ndratic phase chirp, center frequency, and phase, respec-\ntively, of the pulse. The evolution of the pulse-width and\nchirp parameters in the optical fibers is given by the fol-\nlowing coupled equations:\ndx3\ndz\n5 2bx3x4 , (4)\ndx4\ndz\n5 bS x42 2 4\nx3\n4D 2 A2gE0x33 , (5)\nwhere E0 5 x1\n2x3 is a constant proportional to the energy\nof the Gaussian pulse. In this design procedure we con-\nsider that the pulse is launched at the midpoint of the fi-\nber segment, where the DM soliton has the minimum\npulse width (x3min). When the DM soliton reaches the\nend of the fiber segment, the pulse breathes to the maxi-\nmum pulse width (x3max) and there the pulse will enter\nthe CFG for dispersion compensation.\nTo model the effect of the CFG, we exactly solve Eq. (1)\nby setting the nonlinear coefficient g 5 0 for a length of\nfiber l. Then we take the fiber length to zero while keep-\ning the total dispersion *0\nl b(z)dz 5 g constant. That is,\nwe model a CFG as a segment of an ideal fiber with zero\nlength and finite dispersion. The effects of CFG on pulse\nwidth and chirp are given by\nx3out\n2 5 x3in\n2H,\nx4out 5\n1\nH F x4in 2 gS x4in2 1 4x3in4D G ,\nH 5 g2S x4in2 1 4\nx3in\n4D 2 2gx4in 1 1, (6)where y in and yout represent the values of the parameter y\nat the input and the output of the grating.\nOur aim is to derive explicit analytical expressions for\nthe length of the fiber segment and the grating dispersion\nin terms of the fiber dispersion coefficient (b), Kerr coeffi-\ncient (g), maximum pulse width (x3max), minimum pulse\nwidth (x3min), and pulse energy (E0). This can be\nachieved when we solve Eqs. (4)\u2013(6). Taking the deriva-\ntive of Eq. (4) with respect to z and using Eq. (5), we ob-\ntain the equation for pulse duration as\nd2x3\ndz2\n5\n4b2\nx3\n3\n1\nA2bgE0\nx3\n2\n. (7)\nIntegrating Eq. (7) with respect to x3 , we obtain\n1\n2 S dx3dz D\n2\n5\n22b2\nx3\n2\n2\nA2bgE0\nx3\n1 c. (8)\nThe constant of integration c can be evaluated directly at\nthe midpoint of the fiber where the pulse duration reaches\nits minimum (x3min) as\nc 5\n2b2\nx3min\n2\n1\nA2bgE0\nx3min\n. (9)\nThe DM soliton breathes to the maximum pulse width\nx3max at the input of the grating, i.e., x3in 5 x3max . From\nEq. (4), we have x4in 5 2x\u02d93max \/(bx3max), where x\u02d93max is\nthe derivative of x3 with respect to z at x3\n5 x3max . Then, using Eq. (8), we can express x4in as\nx4in 5\n2 1\nbx3max\nS 2 4b2\nx3max\n2\n2\n2A2bgE0\nx3max\n1 2c D 1\/2. (10)\nIn deriving Eq. (10) we used the positive root of x\u02d93 from\nEq. (8) because the pulse width is increasing from the\nminimum (x3min) at the midpoint of the fiber to the maxi-\nmum (x3max) at the input of the grating. The function of\nthe grating is to reverse the input chirp while preserving\nthe same input pulse width, i.e., x4out 5 2x4in and x3out\n5 x3in . From Eqs. (6), the grating will reverse the chirp\nof the soliton without changing its width if H 5 1. With\nthis condition, we obtain the expression for the grating\ndispersion as\ng 5\n2x3max\n4x4in\n4 1 x3max\n4x4in\n2\n. (11)\nIntegrating Eq. (8) with respect to z, we find the length of\nthe fiber to be\nL 5 2G 2\ngbE0 ln~4cx3min 2 2A2gbE0!\ncAc\n, (12)\nwhere\nKwan et al. Vol. 21, No. 4 \/April 2004 \/J. Opt. Soc. Am.

(11) and (12),\nrespectively.\nThe maximum pulse width (x3max) is not a commonly\nused parameter to describe the property of a DM soliton\nsystem. Recently, it has been reported that the maxi-\nmum pulse width is related to the map strength, which is\nan important parameter that describes the property of a\nDM soliton system.19 The map strength S is defined as\nS 5\nuLb 2 gu\nt0\n2\n, (13)\nwhere t0 5 A2 ln 2x3min is the full width at half-\nmaximum (FWHM) intensity pulse width. The relation\nbetween the maximum pulse width (x3max) and map\nstrength (S) is\nx3max 5 S RuLb 2 guS D\n1\/2\n, (14)\nwhere R 5 x3max\n2\/t0\n2 is the breathing parameter. The\nbreathing of the pulse increases as the map strength in-\ncreases. It has been proved that, around the map\nstrength value of S \u2019 S0 5 1.65, the pulse breathing pa-\nrameter R equals S0 .\n19 Using this relationship in Eq.\n(14) and then in Eq. (13), it has been derived that the\nmaximum and minimum pulse widths of any DM soliton\nsystems with a map strength of 1.65 are related as\nx3max 5 ~1.65!\n1\/2t0 5 ~1.65 3 2 ln 2 !\n1\/2x3min . (15)\nHence, to analytically design a dispersion map with map\nstrength S \u2019 1.65, we need only the minimum pulse\nwidth (x3min) and energy (E0) as input pulse parameters.\nThe maximum pulse width (x3max) can be calculated from\nEq. (15). Also, to design a dispersion map with map\nstrength S , 1.65 (S . 1.65), we have to consider\nx3max , ~1.65 3 2 ln 2 !\n1\/2x3min@x3max . ~1.65\n3 2 ln 2 !1\/2x3min#.\nTo illustrate the effectiveness of our analytical design\nprocedure for lossless DM soliton systems, we use the re-\nsults obtained from our analytical design procedure as\ninitial conditions for the averaging method13 to find the\nnumerical periodic DM soliton solutions. We find that\nthe numerical soliton solutions of the nonlinear Schro\u00a8-\ndinger equation in general converge to the same pulse\nwidth that we used to analytically design the dispersion\nmap. We also checked the stability of the numerical soli-\nton solutions by propagating them over 100,000 km.\nWe consider a fiber dispersion of 1 ps\/(km nm), a non-\nlinearity of 2 km21 W21, and an input width of 5 ps (which\ncorresponds to 40-Gbits\/s transmission). The maximum\npulse widths and energies are shown in Fig. 2. Note that\nthe input pulse width of 5 ps is the FWHM (A2 ln 2x3min).From Fig. 2, the maximum pulse width drops by less than\n10% even when the energy increases almost threefold.\nWe designed the DM soliton systems with map strengths\nof 1.65 (solid line) and 3 (dashed line) using the appropri-\nate maximum pulse width. Figure 3 shows the grating\ndispersion and map length values of the dispersion maps\ncalculated from Eqs. (11) and (12), respectively. As the\npulse energy increases, the grating dispersion decreases,\nbut the dispersion map length increases, i.e., the anoma-\nlous average dispersion of the dispersion map increases so\nas to balance the increase in the nonlinear effect. The\ngrating dispersions and map lengths are larger for the\ndispersion map with higher map strength.

METHOD FOR DESIGNING CHIRPED\nFIBER GRATING-COMPENSATED\nDISPERSION-MANAGED SOLITON\nSYSTEMS WITH LOSS AND GAIN\nA. Dispersion-Managed Soliton Systems with Amplifier\nSpacing that is the Same as the Dispersion Map\nLength\nThe analytical method to design CFG-compensated loss-\nless DM soliton systems described in Section 2 can be ex-\ntended to design systems with losses and periodic ampli-\nfication. In this subsection we elaborate on the\nanalytical procedure to design DM soliton systems with\nthe amplifier spacing equal to the length of the dispersion\nmap. Here we consider a DM soliton system that con-\nsists of anomalous dispersion fiber and normal dispersion\ngratings for dense data packing.2,3 The same analytical\ndesign procedure can also be used to design a DM soliton\nsystem that consists of normal dispersion fiber and\nanomalous dispersion gratings. We assume that the am-\nplifiers are located at the middle of the fiber spans in the\ndispersion maps because the resulting DM solitons are\nmore stable.20\nTo detail the analytical design procedure for lossy DM\nsoliton systems, we divide the dispersion map into two\nsections. The first section consists of half of the anoma-\nlous dispersion fiber with length L in1\/2 followed by half of\nthe grating with dispersion g in1\/2 and the second section\nconsists of the other half of the grating with dispersion\ng in2\/2 followed by the remaining half of the fiber with\nlength L in2\/2 as shown in Fig. 5(a). The label E in1 and\nE in2 are, respectively, the input pulse energies of the first\nand second sections. It is well known that the average\ndispersion of the DM soliton system is related to the en-\nergy of the DM soliton.21,22 In the lossless case, the input\nenergy of the DM soliton is available throughout the dis-\npersion map. So the grating at the midpoint of the fiber\ncontributes the same average dispersion to each section of\nFig. 4. FWHM of the DM solitons obtained from the numerical\naveraging method at the middle of the fibers versus pulse energy\nE0 for lossless DM soliton systems.the dispersion map. The same average dispersion is bal-\nanced by the same input pulse energy in both sections of\nthe dispersion map. Hence the fiber length in the first\nsection (i.e., the section of the fiber before the grating) and\nthe second section (i.e., the section of the fiber after the\ngrating) of the dispersion map is the same and equal to\nL\/2 where L is the dispersion map length. In the pres-\nence of losses, the input pulse energy decays exponen-\ntially. The average energy available in the second sec-\ntion of the dispersion map is less than that in the first\nsection. It is therefore necessary to adjust the average\ndispersion of the two sections of the dispersion map ac-\ncording to the locally available average pulse energy in\nlossy DM soliton systems. This can be done when we\nshift the location of the grating in such a way that the lo-\ncal average dispersion before and after the grating follows\nthe decrease in the pulse energy.\nThe analytical design of these two sections of the lossy\ndispersion map is achieved by the following two-step pro-\ncedure:\n(i) Calculate the fiber length and grating dispersion\nvalues of each section by use of the desired pulse and fiber\nparameters as in a lossless system. Note that the input\nenergy of the pulse used for the second section is the re-\nmaining energy after the optical losses in the first section.\n(ii) Adjust the average dispersion of each section by\nmeans of modifying the grating dispersion such that the\nratio between the energy and the average dispersion of\nthe respective section are the same.\nFor the first section, we calculate the grating disper-\nsion g in1 and fiber length L in1 as a lossless case using Eqs.\n(11) and (12), respectively, with the given input pulse en-\nergy (E in1), minimum pulse width (x3min), and maximum\npulse width (x3max) or the map strength (S) value. Hence\nthe average dispersion of the first section of the disper-\nsion map will be ba1 5 ( g in1 1 L in1b)\/L in1 . The average\npulse energy in the first section with length L in1\/2 of the\nlossy system will be\nFig. 5.

Figure 5(b) shows the available pulse energy along\nthe dispersion map. The dotted lines are the average en-\nergy in each section. Thus the average dispersion of the\nfirst section should be decreased accordingly. This can be\nachieved when we appropriately modify the value of the\ngrating dispersion. To achieve this, we keep the ratio be-\ntween the average pulse energy and the average local dis-\npersion in the first section the same for both the lossless\nand the lossy case:\nFig. 6.

We appropriately chose the x3max\nvalue in the range between 7.42 and 7.11 ps for S\n5 1.65 and 11.09 and 10.36 ps for S 5 3, respectively.\nFor a map strength of 1.65, the length of the first section\n(L in1\/2) and length of the second section (L in2\/2) are cal-\nculated to be in the range of 8.34\u20138.85 km and 8.28\u20138.8\nkm, respectively. For S 5 3, the values of L in1\/2 and\nL in2\/2 are in the range of 15.16\u201316.22 km and 14.41\u2013\n13.94 km, respectively. Figure 6 shows the calculated\ngrating dispersion ( g) of the dispersion map. The effect\nof pulse energy on the grating dispersion and map lengthin the lossy case are similar to the lossless case. Both the\ngrating dispersion and the map length values are larger\nin the higher map strength cases. The solid curves in\nFigs. 7(a) and 7(b) represent the numerical results for a\nmap strength of 1.65 and 3, respectively. The numerical\nresults are within 6% of the targeted pulse width of 5 ps.\nDM soliton systems with the map length equal to the\namplifier span are useful for low- and moderate-speed op-\ntical communications. For high-speed communications,\nshort dispersion maps are needed.23\u201325 Hence there will\nbe more than one dispersion map in an amplification\nspan.\nB. Dispersion-Managed Soliton Systems with Amplifier\nSpacing Longer than Dispersion Map Length\nMoubissi et al. proposed an analytical method to design\nDM soliton systems compensated by DCFs with many dis-\npersion maps between the amplifiers.26 For any given\npulse width, energy, and fiber dispersion, the fiber lengths\nin each map can be individually calculated. The lengths\nof the fiber segments are different for different dispersion\nmaps within each amplification span. Here we extend\ntheir method to the design described in Subsection 3.A to\nobtain dense DM soliton systems with identical disper-\nsion maps. Such systems make implementation easier.\nFrom Fig. 3, the dispersion map length (L) does not\nvary significantly even for a large variation in the input\npulse energy (E0). Thus, from the first dispersion map\nlength and a given amplification distance, we can esti-\nmate the required number of dispersion maps (m) within\none amplification span. For each dispersion map, we ap-\nply the analytical design procedure described in Subsec-\ntion 3.A as shown in Fig. 8(a). We then average the dis-Table 1.

We use the same fiber disper-\nsion value of 1.18 ps\/(km nm) for all three map strengths,\nand the resulting dispersion maps have three different\ndispersion map lengths. We use different maximum\npulse widths for the three different map strengths as\nshown in Fig. 9. For the same map strength, the pulse\nundergoes less breathing when the pulse energy in-\ncreases, i.e., the maximum pulse width decreases because\nof the increase in the nonlinear effect.

Table 3\nshows the average map lengths and grating dispersions\nfor the three map strengths. The grating dispersion is\nslightly reduced when the pulse energy is increased. The\nmagnitude of the grating dispersion is larger for a higher\nmap strength.

We launch the\nsame Gaussian pulses used in the analytically designed\nsystems but with GDR in the gratings and obtain the DM\nsoliton solutions by the numerical averaging method. We\nfind that the numerical results are in good agreement\nwith the analytical results, except for the cases of large\nripple amplitude and period. Finally, we show the evolu-\ntion of the Gaussian ansatz in the analytically designed\nsystem with GDR over 10,000 km. The pulse parameters\ndeviate somewhat from the initial parameters but the\ncore of the pulse remains close to the Gaussian ansatz.\nIn the absence of loss, we launch the same Gaussian\npulse in the analytically designed systems in Section 2.\nWe choose GDR with an amplitude of 5 ps and a period of\n0.064 nm in most studied cases. In a real grating, the\namplitude can be as low as 1.5 ps and the dominant pe-\nriod is 0.06 nm.4,27 The dashed lines in Fig. 4 represent\nthe numerical results for GDR. The numerical results in\nthe case of gratings with GDR (dashed lines) are close to\nthat without GDR (solid lines). Thus our analytical\nmethod is also useful to design DM soliton systems in the\npresence of GDR in gratings when loss is negligible.\nIn lossy DM soliton systems with the map length the\nsame as the amplification distance, we study the effect of\nGDR in gratings using the same initial Gaussian pulse as\nthat in Subsection 3.A. The dashed curves in Figs. 7(a)\nand 7(b) show the numerical results obtained by the av-\neraging method for map strengths of 1.65 and 3, respec-\ntively.

The different input maximum\npulse widths to achieve different input pulse energies are\nbetween 7.5 and 7.44 ps. From the analytical design, the\nmap length for these input parameters ranges from 9.91\nto 10 km and the grating dispersion ranges from 215.91\nto 215.73 ps\/nm. We use four dispersion maps so that\nthe amplification distance will be ;40 km.\nWe then introduce GDR with an amplitude of 5 ps and\nperiod of 0.064 nm in the gratings.6 We launch the\nGaussian ansatz x1 exp(2t\n2\/x3min\n2), where x1\n5 (E in \/x3min)\n1\/2 in the analytically designed CFG-\ncompensated DM soliton systems with and without GDR\nand perform numerical averaging13 to obtain the stable\nDM soliton solutions. Figure 11 shows the pulse widths\nversus pulse energies of the numerical solutions.\nCrosses and circles are data points corresponding to the\ncases without and with GDR in the gratings, respectively.\nThe pulse widths of the numerical soliton solutions are\nclose to 5 ps even in the presence of GDR. Because the\nenergy of the side peaks is much smaller than that of the\ncentral peak, the change in the pulse width due to the\nchange in the energy of the central peak is small.\nNext we study the effect of different ripple amplitudes\nand periods on our analytically designed CFG-\ncompensated DM soliton systems. We fix the pulse en-\nergy (E in) and pulse width (x3min) to be 0.13 pJ and 5 ps,\nrespectively. The ripple amplitude and period are varied\nfrom 0 to 8 ps and 0 to 0.11 nm, respectively. Because the\nripple amplitude of the GDR can be as low as 1.5 ps and\nFig. 14. Effect of GDR in the gratings for lossy DM soliton sys-\ntems.

The FWHM of the DM soli-\ntons is 5 ps.the dominant ripple period is 0.06 nm,27 we choose the\nmaximum value of the ripple amplitude and period in our\nstudy to be 8 ps and 0.11 nm, respectively. The relative\nphase between the GDR and pulse spectrum is chosen to\nbe p.6 Figures 12(a) and 12(b) show the pulse widths of\nthe DM solitons versus ripple amplitude and period, re-\nspectively. The ripple period and amplitude are kept con-\nstant as 0.064 nm and 5 ps in Figs. 12(a) and 12(b), re-\nspectively.\nWe observe that the pulse width of the DM soliton in-\ncreases when the ripple amplitude or the ripple period in-\ncreases. For the cases studied, the effective dispersion of\nthe CFGs is almost the same as the grating dispersion be-\ncause of the small ratio between the ripple period and the\npulse spectral bandwidth.6 As the ripple period or am-\nplitude increases, the energy in the side peaks of the DM\nsoliton increases. Figure 13 shows the ratio between the\nenergy of the central peak (Ec) and that of the whole\npulse (E). Thus the nonlinear effect is slightly reduced\nas more energy is transferred from the central peak to the\nside peaks resulting in pulse broadening. If we keep the\nsame pulse energy (width), the pulse width (energy) will\nincrease as the ripple amplitude or period increase. The\nchange in pulse width is up to ;6% in Figs. 12(a) and\n12(b).

The energy of the numerical DM soliton for\nthe ideal grating case is ;0.133 pJ at the amplifier loca-\ntion. The required pulse energy increases when the\nripple amplitude or period increases. The percentage in-\ncrease in energy as a function of ripple amplitude and pe-\nriod are shown in Figs. 14(a) and 14(b), respectively. Be-\ncause of the relative amount of energy in the central peak\nof the DM soliton decreases as the ripple amplitude or pe-\nriod increases, the DM soliton requires larger energy for\nthe same pulse width. The results demonstrate that our\nanalytical design is effective if the CFGs have small\nripple amplitude and short ripple period.\nFinally, we study the evolution of the Gaussian ansatz\nin analytically designed DM soliton systems compensated\nby CFGs. We choose a Gaussian pulse with a duration of\n5 ps (corresponding to 40-Gbits\/s transmission) and pulse\nenergy (E in) of 0.13 pJ. For the DM soliton system, we\nchoose a map strength of 1.65, the maximum FWHM as\n7.44 ps, and fiber dispersion as 1.65 ps\/(km nm). The cal-\nculated map length is ;10 km and the grating dispersion\nis approximately 215.73 ps\/nm. We introduce ripples\nwith amplitude and period of 5 ps and 0.064 nm, respec-\ntively. The ripple period is chosen as 0.064 nm.4,27 Fig-\nure 15 shows the evolution of the Gaussian pulse over\n10,000 km. The pulse core shape does not deviate much\nfrom the initial Gaussian profile. The final pulse has a\npeak intensity of ;29 mW (;30.6 mW for the initial\nGaussian pulse) and has side peaks induced by the GDR.\nThe separation between the side peaks is 125 ps and the\npercentage of the pulse energy transferred to the side\npeaks of the pulse after propagating for 10,000 km is\n;5%. Figure 16 shows the slow dynamics of the pulse\nwidth along the propagation distance. The small fluctua-\ntions of the pulse width are caused by the interaction be-\ntween the DM soliton and the dispersive waves because\nthe initial pulse is not an exact DM soliton solution. For\ncomparison the pulse width of the DM soliton solution ob-\ntained with the numerical averaging method is ;5.1 ps\nand has an energy of 0.13 pJ.\n5. ANALYTICALLY DESIGNED 160-GBITS\/S\nDISPERSION-MANAGED FIBER SYSTEM\nPERFORMANCE WITH HIGHER-\nORDER EFFECTS\nTo show the effectiveness of our analytical design for prac-\ntical DM soliton systems we examine the evolution of a\n32-bit pseudorandom sequence in a single channel at 160\nGbits\/s over 8000 km. We consider a fiber dispersion of 1\nps\/(km nm), a nonlinearity of 2 km21 W21, an input pulse\nwidth of 1.25 ps, and energy (E in) of 0.03 pJ. We choose\nthe map strength to be 1.65 for minimum pulse interac-\ntion, which corresponds to a maximum FWHM of 1.9 ps.\nUsing these input parameters in Eq. (12) we calculate the\nlossless dispersion map length L as 1.02 km. The loss co-efficient of fibers is 0.2 dB\/km. We consider an amplifi-\ncation span of around 40 km, so the number of dispersion\nmaps between amplifiers will be 40. Thus the final map\nlength (L) and grating dispersion (g\u00af) are calculated with\nEqs. (19) and (20) as 1.012 km and 21 ps\/nm, respec-\ntively. The amplifier noise figure is considered to be 4.5\ndB. We use 50 sets of random sequences for both bit se-\nquence and amplifier noise. For high-speed transmis-\nsion, we include the third-order dispersion of 0.1 ps3\/km\nand 20.1 ps3 in the fiber and the grating sections, respec-\ntively. The third-order dispersion of the grating is con-\nsidered in such a way as to compensate the third-order\ndispersion in fibers.28 We also include the intrapulse Ra-\nman scattering with the response time of 3 fs.29 A\nGaussian filter with a bandwidth of 1.6 THz whose cen-\ntral frequency is upshifted by 18.3 GHz is placed after\neach amplifier to reduce the timing jitter and suppress\nthe soliton self-frequency shift.30 Each amplifier has a\ngain of 8.2 dB to compensate the power loss in fibers and\nfilter. Figure 17(a) shows the intensity (solid) and timing\n(dashed) Q factors along the propagation distance. The\nQ factors are derived in linear units for which the value\nQ 5 6 (dotted line) corresponds to a bit-error ratio of\n1029. The timing detection window is chosen to be 70%\nof the bit window. The eye diagram of a random se-\nquence after 7400 km of transmission at which Q 5 6 is\nshown in Fig. 17(b). Figures 7(a) and 7(b) show an excel-\nlent performance over transoceanic distance with the ana-\nlytically designed grating-compensated DM soliton sys-\ntems. Moreover, it demonstrates the utility of our\nanalytical design in high-speed long-haul CFG-\ncompensated optical fiber transmission systems.\n6. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION\nThe results obtained in this paper will be valid in all cases\nwhere the Gaussian ansatz is a good approximation for\nthe soliton solutions of the DM systems compensated by\nCFGs.15,19 For a large map strength (.4) or systems\nwith large energy soliton solutions (.0.2 pJ), the Gauss-\nian ansatz is not a good approximation and we find a\nlarge deviation between the analytical results and the nu-\nmerical results. We also observed that the effect of\nripples decreases with the pulse width because the ratio\nFig. 17. (a) Intensity (solid curve) and timing (dashed curve) Q\nfactors versus propagation distance. The dotted line shows the\nvalue of Q 5 6. (b) Eye diagram of a particular random se-\nquence after 7400 km.\nKwan et al. Vol. 21, No. 4 \/April 2004 \/J. Opt. Soc. Am. B 717of spectral bandwidth to ripple period increases with the\nspectral bandwidth for a fixed ripple period.\nIn this paper we have used anomalous dispersion fiber\nand a normal dispersion grating because one can pack the\nsignal closer in such systems.31 Our analytical method\ncan be applied to design DM soliton systems consisting of\nnormal dispersion fibers and anomalous dispersion grat-\nings as well. Finally, the design is not limited to CFGs; it\ncan be used for any dispersion compensators that have\nlump dispersion, without nonlinearity and power loss.\nIn conclusion, we have presented an analytical method\nfor designing grating-compensated DM soliton systems.\nWe have explicitly derived the expressions for dispersion\nmap length and grating dispersion by solving the evolu-\ntion equations of pulse width and chirp obtained from the\nvariational analysis. Using our design method, one can\nobtain the map length and grating dispersion for the de-\nsired bit rate, pulse energy, and fiber dispersion. We\nhave also described the analytical procedures to design\nlossy DM soliton systems having a dispersion map length\nequal to or shorter than the amplifier spacing. The re-\nsults obtained from our analytical design methods are in\ngood agreement with that from the numerical averaging\nmethod even in the presence of GDR. The evolution of\nthe Gaussian pulse used in the analytically designed DM\nsoliton system shows little deviation over transoceanic\ndistance. Thus our design procedure is a useful tool to\ndesign CFG-compensated DM soliton systems even with\nGDR. The effectiveness of our analytical method has\nbeen supported by the good transmission system perfor-\nmance of the analytically designed 160-Gbits\/s CFG-\ncompensated DM soliton system.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors acknowledge support from the Hong Kong\nPolytechnic University (project G-YW85).\nREFERENCES\n1.
