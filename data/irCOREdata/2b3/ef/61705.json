These results suggest possible multiple solar inputs that may cause \nrefraction\/redistribution of upward wave propagation and result in projecting the solar wind signals onto the \nNAM. The route by which the effects of solar wind forcing might propagate to the lower atmosphere is yet to be \nunderstood. \n \n  3\n  \n1.  Introduction \nThe Northern Annular Mode (NAM) is a planetary-scale pattern of atmospheric \nvariability that is marked by a deep and out of phase relationship in the zonal wind anomalies \nalong ~55\u00b0N and ~35\u00b0N [Baldwin, 2001; Thompson, et al., 2003].  The NAM a meridional \noscillatory pattern between the subtropics and the polar region and is characterized by \nzonally-symmetric meridional meanderings of the extratropical jet [Thompson and Wallace, \n1998]. In general, a stronger and colder polar vortex is found when the NAM is in its positive \nphase, while a weaker and warmer polar vortex is found when the NAM is in its negative \nphase [Baldwin and Dunkerton, 2001]. The NAM fluctuates the most during the northern \nhemispheric (NH) winter, when evidence shows that long-lived anomalies in the stratospheric \nNAM frequently precede similarly persistent anomalies in the tropospheric NAM, implying a \nstratospheric influence on the troposphere [Thompson and Wallace, 1998; Baldwin, 2001]. \nOn time scales greater than one month, the NAM is highly correlated with the North Atlantic \nOscillation (NAO) [van Loon and Rogers, 1978; Hurrell, 1995], and the Arctic Oscillation \n(AO) [Thompson and Wallace, 1998].  \nThe total solar irradiance varies by about 0.1%, while the solar radiation in the ultraviolet \n(UV) part of the spectrum varies by about 5\u22128% over an 11-year solar cycle (11-yr SC) \n[Lean, et al., 1997]. The UV radiative forcing is strongest near the stratopause, where the \nsolar UV is most effectively absorbed by ozone [Haigh, 2003; Hood, 2004]. As a result of in-\nsitu photolysis in the upper stratosphere, higher solar UV inputs at solar maxima cause \nthermal perturbations by increasing the temperature gradient between the tropics and the \nwinter pole [Haigh, 1994; 1996]. In turn, it alters the upward propagation of planetary-scale \nwaves as well as the Brewer-Dobson (BD) circulation, resulting in a strengthened polar \n  4\nvortex and dynamic feedback in the lower atmosphere [Kodera and Kuroda, 2002]. \nNumerous studies have revealed compelling evidence for the signature of the 11-yr SC in \natmospheric wind and temperature [Labitzke and van Loon, 1988; Shindell, et al., 1999; \nMatthes, et al., 2004; Crooks and Gray, 2005; Labitzke, et al., 2006; Salby and Callaghan, \n2006; Camp and Tung, 2007]. Nevertheless, questions remain as to why general circulation \nmodels (GCMs) often predict a much smaller atmospheric response to the 11-yr SC than the \nobserved solar signals, and how the rather weak solar forcing is amplified into larger than \nexpected signals in meteorological parameters [Hoyt and Schatten, 1997; Gray, et al., 2005; \nAustin, et al., 2007]. The discrepancy between modeled and observed solar signals suggests \neither that the solar influence on climate might be greater than anticipated from solar UV \nradiative forcing alone, or that there are some processes inadequately represented by the \nGCMs. \nPossible solar influences on the NAM have been reported in the literature. Ruzmaikin and \nFeynman [2002] found that the NAM was skewed more negatively all the way vertically \nthrough the stratosphere and troposphere during the winters when solar activity is low (LS), \nwhile no clear tendency in the NAM was detected when solar activity is high (HS). Kodera \n[2002; 2003] found that the spatial pattern of the winter NAO is confined to the Atlantic \nsector at LS, whereas it shows a hemispherical structure at HS. Ogi et al. [2003] showed that \nthe spring\/summer circulation correlates well with the previous winter NAO at HS, whereas \nno significant correlation was found at LS. Gimeno et al. [2003] found that the NAO is \npositively correlated to the Northern Hemisphere (NH) surface temperature during HS \nwinters, while no significant correlation was found during LS winters. These observational \nstudies seem to suggest that the 11-yr SC modulates the NAM in a systematic manner. Such a \nmodulation is intriguing as no direct causal mechanism connecting the 11-yr SC and the \nNAM has been obtained. \n  5\nCorrelations have been found between solar wind driven geomagnetic activity and \natmospheric variables including temperature, geopotential height and the NAO [Boberg and \nLundstedt, 2002; 2003; Thejll, et al., 2003; Palamara and Bryant, 2004; Bochnicek and \nHejda, 2005]. For the period of 1973 to 2000, Boberg and Lundstedt [2002; 2003] showed \nthat the variation of the winter NAO is positively correlated with the electric field strength of \nthe solar wind, and suggested a solar wind generated electromagnetic disturbance in the \nionosphere may dynamicly propagate downward to affect the NAO. For the period from the \nmid-1970s to the late 1990s, Bochnicek and Hejda [2005] found that the winter NAO is more \npositive when the geomagnetic index Ap is high, in line with the results of  Boberg and \nLundstedt [2002; 2003]. It is, however, apparent that a multi-decadal scale modulation of the \nrelationship between the NAO and geomagnetic activity may exist, as the correlation tends to \nwax and wane over time-scales of a few decades [Bucha and Bucha, 1998; Thejll, et al., \n2003; Palamara and Bryant, 2004]. Lu et al. [2007] demonstrated that there were multiple \nsolar influences on atmospheric temperature, with both solar irradiance and solar wind \ndrivers playing a role. They used the Ap index [Mayaud, 1980] as a measure of geomagnetic \nactivity, which is indirectly dependent upon the solar wind characteristics. They showed that, \nfor the period 1958-2004, the magnitude of the temperature response in the troposphere and \nthe lower stratosphere to the geomagnetic Ap index is at least comparable to that associated \nwith solar irradiance over the 11-yr SC.  \nThe transfer of energy from the solar wind to the Earth system is a complex process and \ncan depend upon various solar wind parameters [Wang, et al., 2006]. Palmroth et al. [2004] \nhave presented direct evidence for the dependence of Joule heating, generated by currents in \nEarth\u2019s upper atmosphere, on solar wind dynamic pressure. These currents are driven in the \nouter magnetosphere by solar wind action and connect to make a circuit through the auroral \nzones in the lower thermosphere region where they dissipate energy. They can be divided \n  6\ninto \u2018region 1\u2019 currents that flow down into the dawnside and up from the duskside of the \nhigher latitude auroral zone and \u2018region 2\u2019 shielding currents, with the opposite sense to \n\u2018region 1\u2019 currents, which flow into and out of the lower latitude auroral zone. Palmroth et al. \n[2004] pointed out that both the \u2018region 2\u2019 currents and the weaker \u2018region 1\u2019 currents are \nhighly correlated with magnetospheric pressure changes which are, in turn,  balanced with  \nchanges in the solar wind dynamic pressure. They showed (their Fig 4) through \nmagnetohydrodynamic numerical simulation that the Joule heating from these current \nsystems is approximately proportional to the solar wind dynamic pressure. Hence, if solar \nwind geo-effectiveness is determined by the subsequent dissipation of magnetospheric energy \ninto the neutral atmosphere through Joule heating, then the solar wind dynamic pressure can \nbe used as a proxy for this geo-effectiveness. \nThe importance of the solar wind dynamic pressure in transferring energy from the solar \nwind to the Earth\u2019s atmosphere has been demonstrated by several authors. Shue and Kamide \n[2001] showed that, in a magnetic cloud, increasing solar wind density intensified the auroral \nelectrojets for both southward and northward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF).  \nBoudouridis et al. [2003] demonstrated that, under IMF southward conditions, the solar wind \ndynamic pressure increases widened the auroral oval and decreased the polar cap size. Lu et \nal. [2004] reported that compressional waves from within the solar wind dynamic pressure \nenhancements could lead to penetration of solar wind matter and energy across the \nmagnetopause into the magnetosphere. Palmroth et al. [2007] analyzed 236 solar wind \npressure pulses separated into two groups, dependent upon whether the solar wind magnetic \nfield increased or decreased at the time of the pressure pulse. They showed that both groups \ntransfer energy to the magnetosphere; although coupling efficiency decreased when the \nmagnetic field increased, and vice versa, the coupling energy within the pressure pulses with \nincreased magnetic field remained the larger. Zhou and Tsurutani [1999] have shown that \n  7\nsudden increases in the solar wind dynamic pressure can generate global disturbances with \nauroral activity appearing on the dayside and propagating to the nightside with ionospheric \nspeeds consistent with the solar wind pressure pulse speed. In support of this, the inverse \neffect has been observed by Liou et al. [2006] whereby decreasing pressure pulses lead to a \nrapid extinguishing of auroral activity. Observations by Laundal and \u00d8stgaard [2008] \nindicate that the causative mechanism behind proton aurora precipitation during high \ndynamic pressure is connected to the compression of the magnetosphere, which is directly \nrelated to the solar wind dynamic pressure. \nMost of the above studies address transient events, Zhou and Tsurutani [2003] have \nshown that auroral intensity also responds to gradual changes in the solar wind dynamic \npressure. They suggested that the production mechanism for persistent aurora during high \nsolar wind pressure may differ from those for transient events and could be related to Kelvin-\nHelmholtz waves on the magnetospause. Similarly, Liou et al. [2007] showed that the more \nthe magnetosphere was compressed, the more intense the global aurora. They suggested that \nthe increase could be due to the fact that, taking a fixed L-shell, the equatorial magnetic field \nchange under compression would be larger than that for the low altitude field-line mirror-\npoints; the consequent increase in loss cone would increase particle precipitation.  \nTo date, no study has been carried out to examine possible perturbations of energy inputs \nby the solar wind on the NAM and, consequently, on the extratropical circulation. With better \nand longer solar wind and atmospheric data now available, it has become feasible to \nundertake such an investigation. In addition, it is necessary to exam how the 11-yr SC \nmodulates the signals of the solar wind forcing during winter, when the thermal perturbation \nby the 11-yr SC is the biggest, and a large variation of the NAM prevails. Here, a statistical \nassessment of solar wind dynamic pressure forcing on the NAM and its vertical structure is \ncarried out for the NH winter and spring months, when troposphere\/stratosphere coupling is \n  8\nmost vigorous and the zonal flow in the lower stratosphere is often disturbed by upward \npropagating waves from the troposphere [Thompson and Wallace, 2000].  We aim to address \nthree research questions: (1) does the NAM respond to solar wind forcing during the NH \nwinter? (2) if a response is identified, can we interpret the dynamic consequence of such a \nsignature? (3) how do the NAM and atmospheric circulation respond to solar wind forcing \ngiven the different circulation conditions during high and low solar activity - namely, how \ndoes the 11-yr SC modulate the signature of solar wind forcing in the NAM and extratropical \ncirculation? \n2.  Data and Methods \nHere the solar wind dynamic pressure, defined as 2sw sw swP N V= , where Vsw is the flow \nspeed (m s-1) and Nsw is the proton density (n m-3, where n stands for particle number),  is \nused as a proxy for solar wind energy transfer to the Earth\u2019s atmosphere.  In this study, we \nuse monthly averages to search for persistent and accumulative perturbations of Psw on the \nstratospheric and tropospheric wind and temperature field. In this study, the longer-time \nresponse due to changes in monthly averaged Psw is considered. Because the NAM and lower \natmospheric variables have large internal variability on timescales less than one month, using \nmonthly averages will restrict the large random effects of internal variability.  \nHomogeneous observations of solar wind measurements over a few solar cycles are \nnecessary when investigating the Sun\u2019s long-term effect on the Earth\u2019s climate. Daily \naverages of Vsw and Nsw were used, obtained from the OMNI 2 data set in Geocentric Earth \nMagnetic (GEM) coordinates, supplied by the National Space Science Data Centre of NASA \n(http:\/\/gsfc.nasa.gov). This data set is produced from solar wind data collected by 15 \ngeocentric satellites and 3 spacecraft in orbit around the L1 Sun-Earth Lagrange point and has \nbeen carefully compiled through cross-calibration. Though daily averages of Vsw and Nsw are \navailable from 1963 onwards, the temporal coverage before August 1965, and also between \n  9\nSeptember 1982 and October 1994, is below 50% at hourly resolution, with ~8-15 complete \ndays showing as missing in each month [King and Papitashvili, 2005; Finch and Lockwood, \n2007]. Thus, monthly averages for those periods are not as reliable as for other periods. In \nthis study, monthly averages of solar wind Psw from 1966 to 2006, covering nearly 4 solar \ncycles, are used. Psw is estimated as <Nsw  > <Vsw >2 , where < > denotes monthly averages for \nthe given variable. Our statistical analysis suggests that, although qualitatively similar results \ncan be obtained by using < 2sw swN V > , statistically more significant results are obtained when \n<Nsw  > <Vsw >2  was used. This likely to be because the correlation results from < 2sw swN V > \nseem to be more affected by high frequency variations and missing values of the daily data. \nAs solar irradiance was not directly measured for the entire period from 1966 to 2006, \nmonthly averages of 10.7 cm solar radio flux (Fs, 1 sfu = 10-22 Wm-2Hz-1) were downloaded \nfrom the National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) website (www.ngdc.noaa.gov\/stp\/). Fig. \n1(a;b) shows the time series of monthly mean Fs and Psw from 1966 to 2006. The correlation \ncoefficient between Fs and Psw is \u20130.26. Before the mid-1980s, Psw tended to peak at LS but \nthere is no clear correspondence between Fs and Psw afterwards.  \n[Insert Fig. 1 here] \nDecember to January mean solar wind dynamic pressure Psw DJ was used as a measure of \nsolar wind forcing in the NH winter. Winters with values of Psw DJ greater or smaller than its \naverage DJswP (= 1.5x10\n18 n m-1 s-2) are classified as high Psw (HP) and low Psw (LP) winters, \nrespectively. Note that similar results are obtained if the median value of Psw DJ is used for \ngrouping HP and LP winters. It has been shown that solar UV influence on stratospheric \nozone, and consequently stratospheric dynamics, takes place primarily in early winter \n[Kodera, 2002; Matthes, et al., 2004; Kodera and Kuroda, 2005; Matthes, et al., 2006]. For \nthis reason, November to December mean 10.7 cm solar flux (Fs ND) was used as an index to \n  10\ndefine solar irradiance forcing in early winter. Note that similar results are obtained if \nNovember to January mean Fs is used. In this study, winters with values of Fs ND greater or \nsmaller than the average solar flux NDsF ( = 129 sfu) are grouped into high solar activity (HS) \nand low solar activity (LS) winters. For all our analyses, either the NAM or the atmospheric \ndynamic variables are stratified according to HP and LP in relation to solar wind forcing, or \nHS and LS in relation to solar irradiance forcing.  \nOur analyses are based on monthly mean zonal wind and temperature from the ECMWF \nEuropean Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) 40-yr reanalysis (ERA-\n40) (September 1957 to August 2002, [Simmons and Gibson, 2000]) and the ECMWF \nOperational analyses (September 2002 to December 2006, \nhttp:\/\/www.ecmwf.int\/products\/data\/archive\/descriptions\/od\/oper). Both data sets are \navailable on the same 1.125\u00ba grid. ERA-40 has 23 vertical levels ranging from 1000 to 1 hPa \nwhile the Operational data have 21 levels at the same pressure levels as ERA-40 except for \n600 and 775 hPa. We linearly interpolate the Operational data to these missing levels after the \ndata are zonally averaged.  To avoid contamination by the temporary heating caused by \nvolcanic aerosols in the stratosphere, two years of data following three major eruptions (i.e. \nAgung in March, 1963, El Chich\u00f3n in March, 1982, and Pinatubo in June, 1991) are excluded \nfrom our spatial analyses. Zonal-mean zonal wind and temperature were de-seasonlized by \nremoving the long-term mean seasonal cycle from the data for the entire period of 1966-\n2006, where the seasonal cycle was estimated by excluded those years affected by volcanic \neruptions. We find that qualitatively similar results are obtained if the volcanic affected years \nare included. \nThe NAM is defined as the leading empirical orthogonal function (EOF) of monthly \nmean geopotential height anomalies over 20\u00b0\u201390\u00b0N [Baldwin and Dunkerton, 1999; 2001]. \nWe use monthly mean NAM derived from its daily values estimated from both the National \n  11\nCenters for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis and blended ERA-40 and ECMWF \nOperational analyses for the same period of 1966-2006. The NAM derived from \nNCAR\/NCEP reanalysis has 17 vertical levels ranging from 1000 to 10 hPa, while the NAM \nderived from ERA-40 has 23 vertical levels ranging form 1000 to 1 hPa. For simplicity, the \nNAM derived from NCEP reanalysis is referred to here as NCEP-NAM and that derived from \nERA-40 and Operational data is referred to as ERA40-NAM.  The winter is designated by the \nyear in which January falls. \nThe main diagnostic tools employed are composite analysis and linear correlation. Serial \ncorrelation in the wind and temperature data could cause spurious inflation of statistical \nconfidence. To correct this, we calculated the effective number of degrees of freedom n in the \nsame manner as Davis [1976], which was derived in the context of autoregressive models for \nmoderate number of data samples. The statistical significance of the correlation is then \nestimated using a Student's t-test against the null hypothesis of zero correlation with n \u2212 2 \ndegrees of freedom. That is: the p-value was calculated as ( ) ( ) 11 2 222 1r n r \u2212\u2212 \u2212 , where r is the \ncorrelation coefficient, and the confidence level (%) is quoted as (1 \u2212 p)\u00d7100. The same \nMonte Carlo significance test used by Lu et al. [2007] is used to test the statistical \nsignificance of the composite differences.  \n3.  Results \n3.1  Composite Analysis stratified according to Solar Wind Dynamic Pressure   \nFig. 2 shows the composites of deseasonalized zonal-mean zonal wind (line contours) and \ntemperature (color contours) during HP (left panels), and during LP (right panels) for \nDecember to April (from top to bottom). It shows that, under HP, the seasonal progression of \ndeseasonalized extratropical zonal wind is clearly marked by a poleward and downward \nmovement (Fig. 2(c;e;g;i)). Westerly anomalies first appear in the mid-latitude upper \n  12\nstratosphere in December (Fig. 2(a)). A dipole structure that comprises easterly anomalies \nnear the subtropical upper stratosphere and westerly anomalies in the Arctic stratosphere \nemerges in January (Fig. 2(c)). This dipole structure intensifies and extends to the mid- to \nlower stratosphere in February (Fig. 2(e)). In March, the westerly anomalies have descended \ninto the low stratosphere and the troposphere and the easterly anomalies have moved \npoleward (Fig. 2(g)). In April, the easterly anomalies descend to the middle and lower \nstratosphere while the westerly anomalies become substantially weakened (Fig. 2(i)). The \ncorresponding temperature change in the extratropical stratosphere is cooling in December \nthrough February and warming in March and April while the opposite holds in the Arctic \ntroposphere. Overall, the left panel of Fig. 2 suggests a stronger and colder polar vortex and a \nweaker subtropical jet in the NH winter when solar wind forcing is enhanced. The magnitude \nof wind differences between polar westerly anomalies and subtropical easterly anomalies is \nup to 9 m s-1 in February. The magnitude of temperature anomalies in the polar region is up to \n\u22123 K in the winter and 4 K in spring. \n[[Insert Fig. 2 here]] \nThe right-hand panels of Fig. 2 show that, in the extratropical stratosphere, nearly \nopposite wind and temperature anomalies appear under LP. In December, easterly anomalies \nappear in the subtropical to mid-latitude upper stratosphere, suggesting a weakened \nstratopause jet (see Fig. 2(b)). In January, the easterly anomalies have moved to the polar \nregion while westerly anomalies emerge in the subtropical to mid-latitude upper stratosphere. \nFrom January through March, a downward movement of these easterly anomalies is clearly \nvisible (Fig. 2(d;f;h)). The downward descent of these easterly anomalies in the polar region \nis accompanied by the development of westerly anomalies in the subtropical and mid-latitude \nstratosphere in January and February and above in the Arctic upper stratosphere in March. In \nApril, westerly anomalies appear in the Arctic stratosphere and easterly anomalies emerge in \n  13\nthe subtropical stratosphere. In the Arctic, the corresponding temperature shows a steady \ndownward extension of heating anomalies from December through March.  In March, the \npolar temperature anomalies are characterized by a dipole pattern with a cooling cell above \n50 hPa and warming cell below (Fig. 2(h)). In April, the Arctic stratosphere becomes \nanomalously colder while the extratropical stratospheric winds become anomalously more \nwesterly (Fig. 2(j)). Overall, the right-hand panels of Fig. 2 suggest a weaker and warmer \npolar vortex in winter and stronger and colder polar winds in spring when solar wind forcing \nis low. The magnitude of wind differences between polar easterly anomalies and subtropical \nwesterly anomalies is up to 8 m s-1 while the magnitude of warming and cooling in the polar \nstratosphere is up to \u00b13-4 K. \n[[Insert Fig. 3 here]] \nFig. 3 shows the composite differences between HP and LP (i.e. HP \u2212 LP) for zonal wind \n(left panels) and temperature (right panels). Overall, the seasonal progressions of the wind \nand temperature differences resemble those composite under HP, but with nearly doubled \nmagnitude. It shows that the extratropical wind and temperature differences are significant at \n90% and above confidence levels above 90%, and the significance becomes more noticeable \nin late winter. \n3.2  Influences on the NAM and the NH Circulation \nIt has been shown that the NAM is manifested by vertically coherent variations in the \nextratropical winds, which are characterized by deep, zonally symmetric fluctuations in \natmospheric pressure between the polar region and the middle latitudes [Thompson and \nWallace, 1998]. The well-organized circulation differences under HP and LP are likely to \ncause changes to the refraction of planetary wave propagation and, hence, to the meridional \ncirculation at lower levels [Haynes, et al., 1991]. The observed changes of mean wind and \n  14\ntemperature in the upper stratosphere in December may be amplified by the eddy-mean-flow \nfeedback [Kodera and Kuroda, 2002; 2005]. It is known that changes in momentum \ndeposition by large-scale planetary wave breaking are typically projected onto the NAM \n[Kushner and Polvani, 2004; Gerber and Vallis, 2007]. The main aim of this section is to \nexamine possible influences of Psw DJ on the NAM and possible modulation effect of the 11-\nyr SC. \nFig. 4 shows the time series of Jan-Feb mean ERA40-NAM near the tropopause at 150 \nhPa (Fig. 4a), Dec-Jan mean solar wind dynamic pressure Psw DJ (Fig. 4b), and Nov-Dec mean \n10.7-cm solar flux Fs ND (Fig. 4c). It shows that the NAMJF at 150 hPa is not correlated well \nwith either Psw DJ (r = 0.37) or Fs ND (r = 0.20). As it is evident in Fig. 1, Psw DJ and Fs ND  are \nweakly correlated, with a negative correlation coefficient of -0.49, as faster solar wind speed \ntends to occur at solar minima. \n[[Insert Fig. 4 here]] \nFig. 5 shows that significant correlation between the NAMJF at 150 hPa and Psw DJ exists \nonly when Fs ND is high. At HS, the NAMJF derived from either the NCEP reanalysis or \nblended ERA-40 and Operational data sets correlates positively with Psw DJ, with r = 0.74 and \n0.8 respectively. Such correlations are highly significant at >99% confidence levels. At LS, \nhowever, no significant correlation is obtained (r < 0.2). In general, the NAMJF is smaller and \nmore negative at LS than at HS. We found that this feature holds for other pressure levels \nfrom 1000 hPa to 20 hPa (not shown), consistent with Ruzmaikin and Feynman [2002]. The \nred shaded data samples in Fig. 5 indicate years when a major Stratospheric Sudden Warming \n(SSW) occurred. Their distribution suggests that, at HS and in January and February, major \nSSWs are more likely to occur when Psw DJ is low. At LS, however, the occurrence of major \nSSWs is independent of Psw DJ, and more likely to occur when NAMJF is low. The correlation \n  15\npatterns remain similar when either the NAMJF derived from NCEP or that derived from \nblended ERA-40 and Operational data is used. \n[[Insert Fig. 5 here]] \nFig. 6 shows the correlations between Psw DJ and the January, February, and March NAM \n(1st, 2nd, and 3rd columns), and January through March mean NAM (4th column) when Fs DJ is \nhigh; results are shown where NCEP-NAM (upper panels) and the ERA40-NAM are used \n(lower panels). It shows that for individual months and the Jan-Mar average, similar vertical \ncorrelation patterns hold for either the NCEP-NAM or the ERA40-NAM at all the pressure \nlevels below 10 hPa. From the surface to 20 hPa, the January and February NAMs are highly \ncorrelated to Psw DJ, while weaker correlations are found in March.  The highest correlations \nare found in February with maximum correlation coefficient rmax = 0.8 at 200 hPa, and r > 0.5 \nall the way from 1000 hPa to 50 hPa. In January and March, the vertical pattern of the \ncorrelations shows a double-peak altitude profile with one peak near the surface and another \nnear 100-200 hPa, with a minimum 300-400 hPa. The correlation coefficients between Psw DJ \nand NAM JFM are greater than > 0.5 all the way upwards from the surface to 20 hPa with \nconfidence levels > 98%, with a maximum correlation of 0.8 at 100-200 hPa. Above 20 hPa, \nhowever, the correlations are small and statistically insignificant.  \n[[Insert Fig. 6 here]] \nGiven the remarkably high correlations between the Psw DJ and the mid- to late winter \naveraged NAMJFM at HS, and the fact that the NAM describes a large-scale oscillation mode \nof the NH circulation, it is pertinent to examine how Psw DJ may perturb the NH zonal-wind \nand temperature.  Fig. 7 shows the correlation, in a latitudinal altitude cross-section, between \nPsw DJ and the deseasonalized Jan-Feb mean zonal-mean zonal wind UJF (1st row), and both \nthe deseasonalized Jan-Feb mean temperature TJF (2nd row). The 1st, 2nd and 3rd columns are \n  16\nfor all data, HS and LS conditions, respectively. Similar but slightly smaller correlation \ncoefficients with less statistical confidence are obtained if the Jan-Mar mean wind and \ntemperature are used.   \n[[Insert Fig. 7 here]] \nSignificant correlations (with confidence levels >95%) between Psw DJ and UJF can be \nfound when all the data are used despite the fact that the correlation coefficients are relatively \nlow (r < 0.5). The signals are found primarily in the stratosphere and are characterized by a \npair of subtropical and high latitude circulation cells that zonal winds rotate in opposite \ndirections. Positive correlations dominate the region poleward of ~45\u00b0N while negative \ncorrelations mark the region of 20-40\u00b0N. In temperature, the signals of Psw DJ are confined to \nthe extratropics and are manifested by negative correlations in the Arctic upper troposphere \nand lower stratosphere, and positive correlations in the troposphere near ~40-60\u00b0N and in the \nArctic upper stratosphere. \nAt HS, qualitatively similar, but much stronger and more robust correlations are obtained. \nThe statistical relationship between Psw DJ and UJF are again characterized by positive \ncorrelations ~45\u00baN poleward and negative correlations around ~20-40\u00baN. The correlation \ncoefficient is up to \u00b10.8 and is highly significant statistically. The Psw DJ signals, measured by \nthe light shaded area as having 90% confidence levels and above, extend from the surface to \n5 hPa in the polar flank, and from 500 hPa to 2 hPa in the mid-latitude flank. In both flanks, \nthe correlation reaches its maximum at 100-200 hPa with rmax = 0.8 and 0.7 respectively, \nimplying that up to 50-65% of the variations in the extratropical monthly mean wind \nanomalies can be accounted for by Psw DJ. In temperature, the signals of Psw DJ are manifested \nby negative correlations in the Arctic upper troposphere and lower stratosphere, positive \n  17\ncorrelations in the troposphere near ~40-60\u00b0N, and negative correlations in the subtropical \nlower troposphere.  \nThe dynamic implication of those signals is that anomalous rising motion near the Hadley \ncell and over sub-polar latitudes, and corresponding subsidence at mid-latitudes, occurs under \nthe condition when Psw DJ is enhanced. The Psw DJ signals in the upper stratosphere are \nsomehow opposite and marked by positive correlations in the Arctic and negative correlations \nin the extra-polar region. Positive correlations in temperature are observed near the tropical \ntropopause region, though these correlations are not significant. Nevertheless, the out-of-\nphase relationship between lower stratospheric temperature anomalies at tropical and polar \nlatitudes reflects adiabatic temperature changes induced by a weakening of the BD circulation \nin the lower stratosphere. Overall, these Psw DJ signals in UJF and TJF are remarkably similar to \nthose of the NAM [Baldwin and Dunkerton, 2001; Thompson, et al., 2002], explaining the \nsignificant correlations between Psw DJ and the NAM JF shown in Fig. 6.  No significant \ncorrelations can be found in either UJF or TJF at LS.  \nFig. 8 shows the correlation between Psw DJ and Jan-Feb mean UJF extracted at 60\u00b0N, \n150 hPa (left panel), and Jan-Feb mean TJF at 80\u00b0N, 200 hPa (right panel), at HS. \nStrikingly clear positive and negative correlations are shown for UJF and TJF, respectively, \nsuggesting that a colder and stronger lower stratospheric polar vortex is present when Psw \nDJ is high. At those locations, the maximum differences are up to 14 m s-1 in UJF and 12 K \nin TJF. \n[[Insert Fig. 8 here]] \nA remaining issue is whether there is no response in the stratosphere and troposphere to \nsolar wind forcing at LS at all or whether the response is delayed and hence does not reveal \nitself in the analysis reported above.  We can check this by repeating the same analysis with a \n  18\ndelay between the solar wind forcing parameter Psw DJ and the atmospheric variables U, T and \nthe NAM. Fig. 9 shows the correlations, in a latitudinal altitude cross-section, between Psw DJ \nand the deseasonalized Mar-Apr mean zonal-mean zonal wind UMA (upper panel), and \ntemperature TMA (lower panel) at LS. It shows that significant correlations (measured by the \nconfidence levels > 90%) are now apparent between Psw DJ and UMA; these are mostly \nconfined to the extratropics. The signals are characterized by negative correlations poleward \nof ~45\u00baN in the stratosphere, and positive correlations in the Arctic troposphere. The \nmaximum correlation coefficient rmax reaches 0.67 at 75\u00b0N, 700 hPa (also see Fig. 10(a)). The \ncorresponding signals of Psw DJ in TMA are mostly confined to the Arctic and are marked by \npositive correlations in the lower to middle stratosphere and negative correlations in the \ntroposphere. Negative correlations in temperature are apparent near the tropical tropopause. \nThough the tropical correlations are not statistically significant, the out-of-phase relationship \nbetween lower stratospheric temperature correlations at tropical and polar latitudes reflects \nadiabatic temperature changes induced by a strengthened BD circulation. The maximum \ncorrelation coefficient rmax reaches 0.66 at 80\u00b0N, 800 hPa, suggesting that Psw DJ accounts for \nup to 40% of monthly mean temperature variations in the Arctic lower troposphere (see Fig. \n10(b)).  Fig. 10 shows that, at LS, the associated maximum differences in tropospheric wind \nand temperature are up to 5 m s-1 and 3 K, respectively.  \n[[Insert Fig. 9 here]] \n[[Insert Fig. 10 here]] \nFig. 11 shows the correlations between Psw DJ and the March mean ERA40-NAM at LS. It \nshows that significant negative correlations between Psw DJ and March mean NAM exist in the \nstratosphere and the correlation peaks at ~7 hPa with rmin = -0.65. No significant correlation \n  19\nis found in the troposphere, presumably implying a lack of coupling from the stratosphere to \nthe troposphere.  \n[[Insert Fig. 11 here]] \n4. Discussions  \nRecent modelling studies have shown complex dynamic linkages between stratospheric \nforcing and changes in tropospheric eddy activity [Limpasuvan and Hartmann, 2000; \nKushner and Polvani, 2004; Gerber and Vallis, 2007]. It has been found that as the polar \nwinter stratosphere is cooled, the tropospheric jet shifts poleward and the dynamic response \nprojects almost entirely and positively onto the annular mode [Kushner and Polvani, 2004; \nHaigh and Blackburn, 2005]. At the same time, the vertical flux of wave activity from the \ntroposphere to the stratosphere is reduced, and the meridional flux of wave activity from high \nto low latitudes is increased. Thus, the stratospheric wave drag is reduced if the polar upper \nstratosphere is anomalously cooler. Shown in Figs. 2 and 7, in winter, an anomalously \nstronger and colder polar vortex is associated with HP, while a weaker and warmer polar \nvortex is associated with LP. Such effects start in December in the upper stratosphere and last \nuntil February to March. The zonal wind response to enhanced solar wind forcing is broadly \nsimilar to the results of Kushner and Polvani [2004] who modelled the stratosphere and \ntroposphere responses to the impacts of polar upper stratospheric cooling. This implies \nreduced wave forcing in the stratosphere under HP. The poleward and downward migration \nof the solar wind signature from the upper stratosphere to the troposphere further indicates \nthat the solar wind perturbation on stratospheric circulation is manifested primarily through \nchanges in the wave-meanflow interaction [Kuroda and Kodera, 1999; 2004].  \nPossible solar UV perturbations on the NAM have been interpreted in relation to the \nstructure of the polar vortex and its ability to refract the upward propagating planetary waves \n  20\n[Kodera and Kuroda, 2005]. At HS, the changes in the mean flow occurring in the upper \nstratosphere favor more planetary waves to be deflected\/suppressed. According to the \n\u201cdownward control\u201d principle [Haynes, et al., 1991], by redistributing the angular \nmomentum, it further affects the wave forcing on the meanflow at the lower levels. Kodera \nand Kuroda [2005] suggested that the more zonally symmetric pattern of the NAO at HS is a \nresult of prolonged downward extension of solar-induced wind anomalies. Here we show that \nthe seasonal progression of HP composites shows a degree of similarity to that of HS \ncomposites previously reported by Kodera and Kuroda [2002; 2005]. For both cases, the \nresponse to solar forcing is characterized by a poleward and downward jet shift. However, \nstronger solar UV forcing seems to result in the breaking down of the polar vortex and SSWs \nin middle to late winter [Kodera and Kuroda, 2002]. In contrast, enhanced solar wind forcing \nseems to persistently cool and strengthen the polar vortex in mid- to late winter.  \nCastanheira and Graf [2003] showed that the state of the stratospheric polar vortex \naffects the correlation between the NAO and the sea level pressure. The correlations are \nconfined to the Atlantic sector under a weak polar vortex, whereas under a strong polar \nvortex, the correlations extend to the North Pacific. Here we show that statistically significant \ncorrelations between the NAM and Psw DJ exist when early winter solar irradiance flux is \nanomalously high. HP gives rise to a cooler polar upper stratosphere (see Fig. 2(a)) and \nenhances the equator to pole temperature gradient. Such solar wind induced thermal \nperturbations in the upper stratosphere can be further enhanced at HS [Kodera and Kuroda, \n2002] and cause stronger, detectable responses in the lower levels. This is probably why the \nspatial pattern of the winter NAM was confined to the Atlantic sector at LS, whereas it \nshowed a hemispherical structure at HS [Kodera, 2002; 2003].  \nBy using a middle atmospheric GCM, Arnold and Robinson [1998] demonstrated that, in \nthe winter hemisphere, the 11-yr SC modulation of planetary wave propagation reinforces \n  21\nthermal perturbations in the thermosphere. They suggested that, through wave-meanflow \ninteraction, upward propagating planetary waves can couple solar-induced changes in the \nthermosphere down to the stratosphere and lead to changes in the middle atmosphere \ncirculation. The effect is marked by a weakened polar wind and a strengthened wind at mid-\nlatitudes at HS. Arnold and Robinson [2001] extended this work to show that the heating \ninduced by solar wind driven magnetic flux could also produce a measurable stratospheric \nresponse without incorporating any external forcing within the stratosphere. The effect is \nmarked by a stronger and colder polar vortex under high geomagnetic activity. Thus, the \nresults shown Fig. 2 seem to support the mechanism proposed by Arnold and Robinson \n[2001]. \nApart from dynamic transfer of solar forcing, solar wind disturbances may be transferred \ndownward through changes in chemical constituents via energetic particle precipitation (EPP) \n[Solomon, et al., 1982]. Odd nitrogen NOx (NO + NO2) generated by EPP during \ngeomagnetic storms can descend from the upper mesosphere and the lower thermosphere into \nthe stratosphere during polar winter and spring [Callis, et al., 1991; Siskind, et al., 2000; \nCallis, 2001; Randall, et al., 2005; Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4, et al., 2007], and may affect the stratospheric \nradiative balance through catalytic reactions [Brasseur and Solomon, 2005]. The NOx, \ntransported downwards from high altitudes by the polar vortex, would typically take 1-3 \nmonths to reach the upper stratosphere and hence stratospheric responses are likely to take \nplace in spring [Siskind, et al., 2000]. Thus, the rather instantaneous cooling responses in \nwinter months to solar wind dynamic pressure seem to rule out the possibility of chemical \nforcing in the stratosphere by EPP-NOx. If the chemical responses are through a simple local \ncooling effect of in-situ chemistry between stratospheric O3 and descending high-altitude \nEPP-NOx, it is expected that the response to the EPP induced NOx should be a cooling of the \npolar upper stratosphere because of the loss of O3 and consequent reduction in solar UV \n  22\nabsorption. However, the dominant feature of spring polar stratospheric temperature response \nto Psw DJ is warming rather than cooling. This is similar to what has been found by Lu et \nal.[2008b], who used geomagnetic Ap index to represent EPP induced NOx and discovered \nwarming, rather than cooling, responses in the polar stratospheric temperature. They \nsuggested that the stratospheric temperature responses to geomagnetic perturbations are likely \nto be indirect and of dynamic origin. Nevertheless, more detailed radiation budget estimations \nare required before a concrete conclusion can be made.   \nIn early winter and at HS, the equator to pole temperature gradient in the upper \nstratosphere increases, and results in a slowing down of the polar vortex [Kodera and \nKuroda, 2002]. This further increases the equator to pole temperature gradient in the lower \nstratosphere. Haigh [1996] suggested that an increase in stratospheric temperature due to UV \nheating at HS leads to a strengthening of easterly winds penetrating into the troposphere near \nthe subtropics, consequently altering the circulation near the surface. The dynamic \nconsequence is that the tropospheric mid-latitude jet is displaced poleward and the planetary \nwaves propagating from the troposphere into the stratosphere are shifted poleward [Haigh, \n1999; Haigh and Blackburn, 2005]. Such a change in the mean tropospheric circulation \nallows more planetary waves to travel equatorward and less planetary waves to travel \npoleward. Less planetary wave forcing in the polar stratospheric region means a stronger and \ncolder polar vortex. The combined effect of high solar UV irradiance and high Psw in the NH \nwinter is even stronger westerlies in the extratropics and weaker westerlies in the subtropics, \nwhich refract more planetary waves towards the equator. It is know that anomalies in both \ntropospheric and stratospheric circulation influence the probability of planetary wave \npropagation [Limpasuvan and Hartmann, 2000]. When the planetary waves are shifted \npoleward near the tropopause due to enhanced solar UV forcing, the wave-meanflow \ninteraction is characterized by enhanced positive feedback to changes of the equator to pole \n  23\ntemperature gradient in the upper stratosphere, and this effect is mostly projected onto the \nNAM [Kushner and Polvani, 2004; Song and Robinson, 2004]. Thus the changes in the \nbackground circulation by solar UV may provide a suitable wave-guide condition for \nstratospheric solar wind forcing signals to be extended downward.  Thus, the sensitivity of \nplanetary wave propagation in winter to the background temperature and wind structure \nprovides a possible mechanism by which the solar wind influences penetrate from the upper \nstratosphere to the troposphere. Although these mechanisms might explain the robustly high \ncorrelations between Psw DJ and the Jan-Mar mean NAM, the precise details of how that \ninfluence is achieved are unknown.  \nDuring the NH winter, the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) in the equatorial lower \nstratosphere strongly influences the polar stratosphere. The well-known phenomenon often \nreferred to as the Holton-Tan (HT) effect, suggests a colder and stronger polar vortex during \nwesterly QBO, and a warmer and more disturbed polar vortex during easterly QBO [Holton \nand Tan, 1980; 1982]. Studies have noted that the HT effect is strongest when the 11-year \nsolar cycle is at its minimum but that the relationship substantially weakens or even reverses \nduring solar maximum [Labitzke and Chanin, 1988; Naito and Hirota, 1997; Gray, et al., \n2001]. Here we find that the Arctic stratospheric temperature is strongly correlated with Psw DJ \nduring HS winter. Compared to the QBO signals in the extratropical stratosphere extracted \nfrom the same data set [Lu, et al., 2008a], the magnitude of the Psw DJ signals in winter \nmonths are larger than that of the QBO. This may be one explanation of why the HT effect \nhas been found to be substantially weaker around solar maximum.  \n4 Conclusions \nIn the NH winter, the response of atmospheric circulation to solar wind dynamic pressure \nenhancement appears to be marked by a stronger polar vortex and a weaker sub-tropical jet in \n  24\nthe upper to middle stratosphere. Westerly anomalies appear in the subtropics to mid-\nlatitudes near the stratopause in December. Then the subtropical jet becomes weaker and the \npolar vortex becomes stronger in January through March. As the winter progresses, the Arctic \nbecomes colder and the jet anomalies shift poleward and downward.  \nThere are substantial differences between the signals of solar wind dynamic pressure Psw \nDJ at HS and those at LS. At HS, Psw DJ is positively correlated with the January to March \nNAM all the way from the surface to the mid-stratosphere, except for the pressure levels \nbetween 300 and 500 hPa. This implies a strengthened polar vortex, a reduced Brewer-\nDobson circulation and enhanced coupling between the stratosphere and the troposphere. The \nsignature of Psw DJ is marked by an oscillation pattern with westerly anomalies at ~40-80\u00b0N, \nextending from the surface to the 10 hPa pressure level, and easterly anomalies at ~20-40\u00b0N, \nextending from 500 hPa to 2 hPa. The corresponding signals in temperature are marked by \nout-of phase relationships of temperature anomalies both between low and high latitudes and \nbetween the stratosphere and troposphere. In the polar region, it is characterized by a vertical \nbipolar structure with warming in the upper stratosphere and cooling in the lower stratosphere \nand troposphere. The opposite pattern holds at sub-tropical to mid-latitudes.  \nAt LS, there is no signature of Psw DJ in the NH winter but negative correlations between \nPsw DJ and the NAM are found in the stratosphere during spring (i.e. March and April), \nimplying a delayed and opposite solar wind perturbation on the stratospheric circulation \ncompared to those occurring in winter at HS. In spring, the wind and temperature responses \nto Psw DJ are confined to high latitudes and there is no correlation with the NAM in the \ntroposphere, suggesting a hampered stratosphere-troposphere coupling compared to that \nunder HS conditions.  The correlation between Psw DJ and the NAM is highly significant. The \nspatial patterns of Psw DJ signature in zonal wind and temperature are remarkably robust and \nare consistent with the known pattern of the NAM in zonal wind and temperature.  \n  25\nWe note that, for the period from 1966-2006, both the magnitudes of Psw DJ signals and \nthe correlation coefficients are larger than those associated with the 11-yr SC and the QBO. \nThe results suggest that, in addition to solar UV irradiance, solar wind may also play a \nsignificant role in perturbing large-scale circulation in the stratosphere and troposphere. \nDespite the statistical robustness of the Psw DJ signals, they do not explain the mechanism by \nwhich variations in the upper stratospheric wind and temperature are influenced by the solar \nwind dynamic pressure. We speculate that possible mechanisms could be:  \n1) geomagnetic activity induced chemical changes, such as NOx enhancement, and \ntheir downward descent under dark polar vortex conditions may be enhanced by \nsolar UV heating of O3 in the stratosphere; this indirectly strengthens the polar \nvortex transporting NOx-rich air into the upper stratosphere [Randall, et al., 2005];  \n2) temperature changes induced by solar wind forcing in the mesosphere and the \nlower thermosphere cause changes in the waveguides of the upward propagating \nwaves [Arnold and Robinson, 1998; 2001].  \nThese two mechanisms may work in combination but more studies are needed to identify \nthe actual mechanisms. However, we note that given the relatively short response time and \ninactiveness of the stratospheric catalytic reaction cycles in the winter polar region, it is \nunlikely that the in-situ chemical effect of descending EPP-NOx on stratospheric ozone would \nhave a dominant influence on the strengthening of the polar vortex [Lu, et al., 2008b]. \nThe route by which the effects of either solar irradiance or solar wind forcing might \npropagate to the lower atmosphere is yet to be explored. The results reported here strongly \nindicate complex dynamic interactions between the two different types of solar forcing. \nPreviously reported mechanisms in terms of stratosphere-troposphere coupling may be used \nto explain such interactions [Kushner and Polvani, 2004; Song and Robinson, 2004; Haigh, et \n  26\nal., 2005; Haigh and Blackburn, 2005]. Nevertheless, the 11-yr SC modulated Psw DJ signals \nfound in the observational data are intriguing, and by the spatial patterns of the signals and \nthe significant correlation with the NAM, suggest that the impact of stratospheric circulation \nchanges on wave propagation is key to the mechanisms involved. Further studies are required \nto understand how enhanced solar wind forcing modulates the upward propagating planetary \nwaves, and why the modulation differs from solar maximum to solar minimum. Studies are \nalso needed to understand in detail why there is a stronger stratosphere-troposphere coupling \nof Psw DJ signals (through the NAM) at HS and why the Psw DJ  signals are opposite and \ndelayed at LS. A satisfactory explanation for such multiple solar influences must address two \nquestions: Firstly, how and to what extent do solar UV and solar wind related processes \nimpact on the variations in the stratospheric zonal flow and temperature? Secondly, how and \nto what extent do such modulations of the stratospheric mean circulation affect the amplitude \nand location of stratospheric wave drag and the associated radiative heating? In addition, \nmore studies are needed to determine to what extent the processes occurring in the \nmesosphere and the thermosphere influence the circulation in the lower part of the \natmosphere.  \n \nAcknowledgments.
