First theoretical and experimental investigations on the\nlinewidth enhancement factor ~a-factor! have shown that the\nquantum-dot laser exhibits less filamentation than the\nquantum-well laser.3 In this letter, we investigate the spa-\ntiotemporal dynamics and beam quality of InGaAs quantum-\ndot lasers ~dot density 1011 cm22) emitting at 1.1 mm. For\ndirect comparison with quantum-well lasers, we contrast and\ncompare our theoretical and experimental results with corre-\nsponding lasers with a quantum-well gain medium, but iden-\ntical waveguide structure.\nOur theoretical analysis is based on an effective multi-\nmode Maxwell\u2013Bloch approach4 that takes into account, in\nparticular, the spatially and temporally varying material\nproperties ~of, e.g., the quantum-well or the active dot en-\nsemble! and physical interactions that have a detrimental in-\nfluence on beam quality and spectral characteristics. Simula-\ntions on the basis of this approach provide an interpretation\nof experimental results such as near-field profiles, power, and\nbeam quality factor M 2.5\nThe multimode Maxwell\u2013Bloch equations consist of\nmultimode wave equations and two-level Bloch equations\nfor the dynamics of carriers as well as the dipole dynamics\nwithin the active media.

Via the\npolarization, the light fields are locally coupled to carriers\nwithin the active medium. On the basis of an effective two-\nlevel description of the material properties of the active me-\ndium ~e.g., quantum well or quantum dot!, the dynamics of\nthe carrier density and the polarization can be described by\nthe following Bloch equations:\n]\n]t\nP ~0 !\n6 52gpF S 11i v\u00afgpD1~r1is!NGP ~0 !6\n1b~~N ~0 !1ia!E61N ~1 !E7!\n]\n]t\nP ~1 !\n6 52gpF S 11i v\u00afgpD1~r1is!NGP ~1 !6 1bN ~1 !E6\n]\n]t\nN ~0 !5L1D f\u201e2N ~0 !2gnrN ~0 !22~E1~P ~0 !\n1 2L0E1!*\n1E2~P ~0 !\n2 2L0E2!*1c.c.! ~2!\n]\n]t\nN ~1 !524D fkz\n2N ~1 !2gnrN ~1 !22~E1~P ~0 !\n2 2L0E2!*\n1E2*~P ~0 !\n1 2L0E1!1E1*P ~1 !\n1 1E2P ~1 !\n2*!.\nIn Eqs. ~1! and ~2!

The dimensionless constant b determines the maxi-\nmum gain. The material parameters r and s consider the\nincrease in the polarization decay rate and the drift of the\ngain maximum with increasing carrier density, respectively.\nDerived from microscopic calculations,4 they include the in-\ndividual material properties of the quantum-well or quantum-\ndot device. The a-factor describes the amplitude\u2013phase cou-\npling. The parameter L0 guarantees a vanishing gain at\ntransparency.\nNote that Eq. ~2! constitutes a very general description\nof the dipole dynamics within the active layer of a semicon-\nductor laser. Its application to a quantum-dot structure re-\nquires some modifications to account for the characteristics\nof a quantum-dot laser ensemble: First, in order to model the\ndynamic carrier escape and carrier capture from the wetting\nlayer states, we include in the equation for the carrier density\nan additional term ]N0 \/]tu describing carrier escape and car-\nrier capture into the dot from the wetting layer.6 The dynam-\nics of the carriers in the layers surrounding the dots thereby\nis described by a diffusion equation.6 Secondly, P (0,1)\n12 (i , j)\nand v\u00af refer to \u2018\u2018interlevel dipoles\u2019\u2019 and frequencies of the\nrespective electron and hole levels ~with level index \u2018\u2018i\u2019\u2019 for\nelectrons and \u2018\u2018j\u2019\u2019 for holes, respectively!. Furthermore, the a\nfactor typically has a value of 2.5\u20133 in a quantum-well laser\nwhereas the quantum-dot laser is characterized by a reduced\namplitude\u2013phase coupling of 1\u20131.5. The multimode\nMaxwell\u2013Bloch equations @Eqs. ~1! and ~2!# taking into ac-\ncount the dynamic interaction of the counterpropagating light\nfields with spatially dependent microscopic properties of the\nactive media will in the following be applied to quantum-\nwell and quantum-dot lasers of identical waveguide struc-\nture.\nFigure 1 shows, in direct comparison, the theoretical\n@Figs. 1~a! and 1~b!# and experimental @Fig. 1~c!# results of\nthe nearfield characteristics of quantum-well Fig. 1 ~left-\nhand side! and quantum-dot lasers Fig. 1 ~right-hand side! of\nidentical waveguide design. The width of the lasers is 6 mm,\nthe cavity length was 1.3 mm. Figure 1~a! shows the calcu-\nlated near-field dynamics of a quantum-well ~left-hand side!\nand quantum-dot laser ~right-hand side!. In the example, the\ninjection current density was chosen such that the output\npower was 60 mW. For small output powers, the near field of\na quantum-well laser is still rather uniform. However, if we\noperate the laser at higher-power levels, a very different be-\nhavior can be observed. Physical processes, such as carrier\ndiffusion and scattering in combination with light diffraction,\nlead to a complex transverse migration of the light fields\n@Fig. 1~a! left-hand side#. In contrast, the transverse dynam-\nics of the light fields propagating in the quantum-dot laser\n@Fig. 1~a! right-hand side# is still rather uniform ~for the\nsame output power!. This complex light field dynamics are\ngoverned by the ~space- and time-dependent! mutual inter-\nplay of carriers with spontaneous and induced emission pro-\ncesses. In combination with ~counter-! propagation effects\nand transverse migration of the light fields, it affects and\ndetermines the near field and beam quality that can be mea-\nsured and observed in an experimental investigation.\nA comparison of the calculated and measured time-\naveraged near fields of a quantum-well laser ~left-hand side!\nand a quantum-dot laser ~right-hand side! @Figs. 1~b! and\n1~c!# demonstrates that the increased influence of the trans-\nverse degree of freedom leads in the quantum-well laser to\nthe formation of filaments whereas the quantum-dot laser\nshows a Gaussian-shaped uniform near-field distribution.\nThe theoretical results obtained with the Maxwell\u2013Bloch\nequations are in good agreement with the measured near-\nfield distributions @Fig. 1~c!#. The side lobes next to the laser\nridge that can be seen in Fig. 1~c! result from current spread-\ning in the cladding and waveguide layers. The suppressed\ntransverse light field dynamics observed in experiment and\nsimulation clearly demonstrate the promising device perfor-\nmance of quantum-dot lasers compared to large area lasers\nand laser amplifiers which show a strong tendency for\nfilamentation formation.7\u20139\nBy varying the carrier injection current and the laser\nwidth in the simulation, we have systematically analyzed the\nspatiotemporal light field dynamics of quantum-well and\nquantum-dot lasers. The theoretical and measured values of\nthe beam quality factor M 2 as obtained by the spatiotemporal\nsimulation are depicted in Fig. 2 in dependence on stripe\nwidth @Fig. 2~a!# and output power @Fig. 2~b!# ~for the same\noutput power of 20 mW!. With increasing stripe width @Fig.\n2~a!#, the transverse degree effectively gets more important:\nPhysical processes, such as carrier diffusion and diffraction\nof the light fields, lead to characteristic dynamic optical pat-\nterns that typically lie in the mm regime. In combination with\nthe dynamic phase changes, this results in a deterioration of\nthe beam quality, i.e., the M 2 parameter of the quantum-well\nand the quantum-dot laser increases with increasing stripe\nFIG. 1.

However, due to the strong localization of the carriers\nand the reduced a-factor, the M 2 values of the quantum-dot\nlaser are always smaller then the respective values of the\nquantum-well structure. In particular, the quantum-dot laser\nshows a characteristic threshold near 8 mm. In this interme-\ndiate stripe regime, the quantum-dot laser is still single mode\nwhereas M 2.2 for the quantum-well laser. The dependence\nof M 2 on output power is shown in Fig. 2~b! ~for a stripe\nwidth of 6 mm!. In the quantum-well laser, an increase in the\ninjection current density not only increases the output power\nbut simultaneously leads to an increase in the M 2 parameter.\nThis is a direct consequence of dynamic carrier diffusion and\nlight diffraction affecting the light fields during their propa-\ngation in the laser. In contrast, the quantum-dot laser shows\nalmost no dependence on output power. The dependence of\nM 2 on stripe width and output power can be confirmed by\nthe experimental measurements performed on the same de-\nvices. Our numerical results clearly demonstrate that\nquantum-dot lasers have a much better beam quality com-\npared to quantum-well lasers of same geometry. The strong\nlocalization of the carriers in the dots in combination with\nthe reduced amplitude phase coupling thus guarantees a good\nspatial quality.\nFor an analysis of the spectral properties Fig. 3 shows\ncalculated ~spatially resolved! emission spectra of the\nquantum-well ~left-hand side! and the quantum-dot laser\n~right-hand side!. In Fig. 3, the vertical axis denotes the lat-\neral coordinate of the laser and the horizontal axis refers to\nthe frequency. Both structures show a set of longitudinal\nmodes that coexist in the laser\u2014according to the Fabry-Perot\nmodes of the cavity. In the quantum-well laser @Fig. 3~a!#,\nthe width of the laser is larger than typical interaction length\nscales of the laser. As a consequence, a characteristic trans-\nverse spatiospectral coupling arises leading to spectral broad-\nening of the individual modes. In addition, each longitudinal\nmode is surrounded by a set of transverse modes. In the case\nof the quantum-dot laser, the strong carrier localization and\nthe discrete energy levels lead to reduced carrier diffusion, a\nreduction of transverse dynamics, and low amplitude\u2013phase\ncoupling ~a-factor!. As a consequence, the emission spec-\ntrum is of much higher spectral purity than in the situation of\nthe quantum-well laser.\nIn conclusion, we have shown numerical and experimen-\ntal results on the spatiotemporal dynamics and beam quality\nof quantum-dot and quantum-well lasers. For characteristic\nsets of material parameters describing the active quantum-\nwell or the quantum-dot media, the effective Maxwell\u2013\nBloch equations allow a realistic simulation of the spatiotem-\nporal dynamics of quantum-dot and quantum-well lasers\ncomplementing experimentally measured near-field profiles\nand beam quality factors. The self-consistent inclusion of all\nrelevant geometrical parameters and material properties ~e.g.,\nrefractive index and waveguide structure, dot density, and\nspatial dot distribution! provides a fundamental description\nof the underlying physical processes and guarantees a realis-\ntic modeling of the laser behavior. In particular, the simula-\ntions allow the systematic variation of the individual param-\neters and properties with respect to their influence on beam\nquality and power. In combination, the theoretical and ex-\nperimental investigations clearly indicate that the quantum-\ndot laser is a highly promising laser source for the generation\nof long-wavelength radiation with improved spatial and\nspectral purity. Experiment and modeling together may thus\nsignificantly contribute to the development of optimized in-\nnovative quantum-dot devices.\n1 D. Bimberg, M. Grundmann, and N. N.
