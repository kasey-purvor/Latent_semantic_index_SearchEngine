The trial\nseeks to determine whether a theory-informed worksheet appended to feedback reports can help family physicians\nimprove quality of care for their patients with diabetes and\/or ischemic heart disease.\nMethods: Two-arm cluster trial was conducted with participating primary care practices allocated using\nminimization to simple feedback or enhanced feedback group. The simple feedback group receives performance\nfeedback reports every six months for two years regarding the proportion of their patients with diabetes and\/or\nischemic heart disease who are meeting quality targets. The enhanced feedback group receives these same reports\nas well as a theory-informed worksheet designed to facilitate goal setting and action plan development in\nresponse to the feedback reports. Participants are family physicians from across Ontario who use electronic medical\nrecords; data for rostered patients are used to produce the feedback reports and for analysis.\nOutcomes: The primary disease outcomes are the blood pressure (BP), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol\n(LDL) levels. The primary process measure is a composite score indicating the number of recommended activities\n(e.g., tests and prescriptions) conducted by the family physicians for their patients with diabetes and\/or ischemic\nheart disease within the appropriate timeframe. Secondary outcomes are the proportion of patients whose results\nmeet targets for glucose, LDL, and BP as well as the percent of patients receiving relevant prescriptions. A\nqualitative process evaluation using semi-structured interviews will explore perceived barriers to behaviour change\nin response to feedback reports and preferences with regard to feedback design.\nAnalysis: Intention-to-treat approach will be used to analyze the trial. Analysis will be performed on patient-level\nvariables using generalized estimating equation models to adjust for covariates and account for the clustered\nnature of the data. The trial is powered to show small, but clinically important differences of 7 mmHG in systolic\nBP and 0.32 mmol\/L in LDL.\nTrial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00996645\n* Correspondence: noah.ivers@utoronto.ca\n1Women\u2019s College Hospital Family Health Team, 76 Grenville Street, Toronto\nON, M5 S 1B2, Canada\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\nIvers et al.

Research\nfindings regarding quality indicators in diabetes and\nIHD suggest agreement and acceptance of guidelines\namongst Canadian family practitioners, who manage the\nbulk of care for these patients [2]. Unfortunately, there\nremains a large gap between ideal and actual care pro-\nvided to such patients, making them a common focus\nfor translational research [3]. Diabetes and IHD are con-\nsidered particularly good targets for quality improve-\nment strategies such as audit and feedback which can\nincrease adoption and adherence to guidelines [4,5].\nAudit and feedback has been defined as a \u2018summary of\nperformance in a specific area with or without recom-\nmendations for action\u2019 [6] and is felt to be effective\nbecause it may overcome physicians\u2019 limited ability to\naccurately self-assess [7]. Thus, audit and feedback\nfocuses on addressing the gap between ideal and actual\ncare that is within the control of the health care provi-\nder and is often the foundation of multifaceted quality\nimprovement interventions.\nThe Cochrane review of audit and feedback [8] con-\ncluded that it is effective, but the authors noted great\nvariability in the design and the effectiveness of feedback\ninterventions. That meta-analysis included 118 trials, find-\ning a median increase in compliance with guidelines of 5%\nfor dichotomous outcomes (inter-quartile range 3% to\n11%) and 16% for continuous outcomes (inter-quartile\nrange 5% to 37%), but great heterogeneity in both inter-\nvention design and reporting limited conclusions regard-\ning how to best implement audit and feedback. Therefore,\nthe important question to ask at this point is not whether\nfeedback is effective, but how feedback can be most effec-\ntive. Optimal design and delivery of feedback should more\nconsistently lead to improved results, but few studies have\ntested different designs of feedback [9]. In an attempt to\nfurther delineate how to most effectively design and deliver\nfeedback interventions, Hysong completed a re-analysis of\nthe Cochrane review [10], finding that feedback had greater\neffectiveness with increasing frequency, with written rather\nthan verbal or graphical delivery, and with feedback that\nincluded \u2018correct solution information.\u2019 Most recently,\nGardner et al. conducted a reanalysis of the Cochrane\nreview to test target-setting and action plans as effect-\nmodifiers of feedback [11], but very few studies explicitly\ndescribed their use of targets and\/or action plans, making\ntheir report inconclusive.\nUsing theory to design an enhanced feedback\nintervention\nBriefly, performance feedback may be understood to work\nby directing attention toward a discrepancy between an\nexpected or desired state and reality [12]. When present,\nthis discrepancy may encourage the recipient to generate\nincreased effort toward the goal, especially if the next\nsteps or sub-goals are clear. Alternatively, the feedback\nmay be perceived as inaccurate and disregarded, or the\nfeedback may result in the recipient lowering their goal to\nmake it more achievable [13]. To be effective, the ideally\ndesigned feedback would consistently lead to changes in\nbehaviour by the recipient through increased efforts to\nreach appropriate goals.\nThere are both theoretical and empirical reasons to\nbelieve that feedback will be more effective if the recipi-\nents set goals [14] and develop action plans [15].\nAccording to Goal-Setting Theory [16], those who are\ndissatisfied with their performance will develop a change\nin behaviour if they are committed to the goal and if\nthey meet a threshold level of self-efficacy for that task.\nBandura explains that people are more likely to try to\naccomplish a goal if they believe their efforts will be\nsuccessful [17].\nPsychologists have repeatedly shown that detailed\nplans regarding where\/when\/how behaviours will be\nenacted increases the likelihood of task accomplishment\n[18]. In the context of feedback and goals, these plans\nmay increase goal-directed behaviours by increasing\nself-efficacy. Action plans can also facilitate success by\nincreasing goal-commitment to overcome barriers such\nas distraction or fatigue; implementation plans in parti-\ncular seem to increase goal-directed behaviours [19].\nImplementation intentions are developed through if\/\nthen statements, wherein the participant must connect a\nsituation (if) with a behavioural response (then). With\nsome effort (i.e., considering and writing down the\nplan), the connection made between contextual cues\nand an action plan can become automatic, thereby\nincreasing goal attainment without conscious intent.\nThere is some empirical evidence that intensive inter-\nventions that help participants set practice improvement\nplans in response to feedback can improve outcomes\n[20], possibly by increasing goal commitment and self-\nefficacy. Recognizing that feedback alone is sometimes\nnot enough to change provider behaviours, further\nimprovements have been found by pairing feedback with\nmore intensive (and expensive) co-interventions, such as\neducational outreach visits [21]. Although these inten-\nsive interventions are rarely explicitly informed by the-\nory [22], they presumably work because they help\nparticipants to take action to improve outcomes for\npatients. The assumption is that healthcare providers\nintend to provide consistently high quality of care, but\nare uncertain how to change their behaviours to accom-\nplish this feat. Therefore, an intervention aiming to\nclose this intention-behaviour-gap could be very effec-\ntive. In this study, it is expected that the feedback\nIvers et al. Implementation Science 2010, 5:98\nhttp:\/\/www.implementationscience.com\/content\/5\/1\/98\nPage 2 of 10\nreports will draw family physicians\u2019 attention to a discre-\npancy between actual and ideal care \u2013 e.g., fewer patients\nthan expected are at target blood pressure (BP) \u2013 and\nthat a theoretically-informed worksheet can be developed\nto facilitate goal-setting and action-plans to enhance the\nlikelihood that they will take action to close this gap (e.g.,\nimplement systems to monitor at-risk patients with BP\nabove target). See Figure 1 for an illustration of potential\nrole of goal-setting and action plans on effectiveness of\nfeedback.\nStudy objectives and hypotheses\nFor family physicians receiving performance feedback\nreporting the percentage of their patients with diabetes\nand\/or IHD who are achieving quality targets, the addi-\ntion of a theory-informed worksheet designed to facili-\ntate goal setting and the development of action plans\nwill lead to changes in behaviour and improved out-\ncomes. A second hypothesis is that those physicians in\nthe intervention group who properly complete the work-\nsheet will have the largest improvement in outcomes.\nFinally, we aim to explore qualitatively the perceived\nbarriers to behaviour change in response to feedback\nreports and the preferences of family physicians with\nregard to feedback design.\nMethods\nStudy design\nThis is a mixed methods study built around a pragmatic,\ncluster-trial with two arms; one group will receive \u2018sim-\nple\u2019 feedback, while the other will receive \u2018enhanced\u2019\nfeedback. Allocation is at the practice level to reduce\nrisk of contamination and the intervention directed at\nthe physician level. In Ontario, family physicians do\nwork in groups, but this generally involves sharing\nadministrative resources, not patients. The usual\napproach is for chronic conditions to be dealt with by\nthe personal physician, while acute issues may be dealt\nwith by the available physician. Therefore, we believe\nthat an intervention aimed at the physician rather than\nthe entire clinic is appropriate. The analysis will be at\nthe patient level, including both disease-level outcomes\nof BP and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) and\na composite score of process variables, as detailed in the\n\u2018outcomes\u2019 section.\nThe lack of a control group receiving no feedback at\nall is both necessary (because participants expected\nsomething in return for contributing data) and prag-\nmatic (because most quality improvement interventions\ninclude some degree of feedback, making this the \u2018usual\ncare\u2019 comparator) [23]. In particular, the Ministry of\nHealth and Long-Term Care in Ontario (MOHLTC) is\nproviding feedback reports to all family physicians as\npart of its diabetes strategy [24].\nThis study has received approval from the Research\nEthics Office at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre\n(271-2006) and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov\n(NCT00996645).\nParticipants and data collection\nThrough the Electronic Medical Record Administrative\ndata Linked Database (EMRALD), family physicians\nfrom all regions of Ontario who have been using Prac-\ntice Solutions\u00ae Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) for at\nleast 12 months have signed a data-sharing agreement\nwith the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES)\nwhere EMRALD is held. ICES is a prescribed entity,\nunder the province of Ontario\u2019s Personal Health Infor-\nmation Protection Act, which allows for the collection\nof individual level health information for use in planning\nand managing the healthcare system.\nAt ICES, mechanisms to extract, securely transfer, and\nde-identify the EMR data have been established [25]. For\npatient visits, consultations, investigations, and treat-\nments, data in EMRALD compare well with (and often\nout-perform) administrative databases [unpublished\ndata]. Furthermore, algorithms to identify patients in the\nEMRALD database with diabetes (sensitivity 83.1%, spe-\ncificity 98.2%) [26] and IHD (sensitivity 72.4%, specificity\n99.6%) [27] have been validated. Since publishing those\npapers, we have made further improvement to the dia-\nbetes algorithm (by considering the \u2018problem list\u2019 and\n\u2018past medical history\u2019 fields in addition to the lab tests\nand prescriptions) resulting in a sensitivity of 90.9% and\nspecificity of 99.2%. The algorithm for identification of\nthe IHD algorithm has also been improved by continuing\nto refine the search terms used to identify patients in the\n\u2018problem-list\u2019 and \u2018past medical history\u2019 fields. The algo-\nrithms developed for EMRALD do not require any spe-\ncial coding or data input by the participating physicians.\nFamily physicians were originally invited to participate\nin EMRALD through convenience sampling of EMR\n????????\n????????????\n?????\n??????????????\n???????????\n??????????\n??????????\n??????????????????????????\n?????????????????????????????\n???????????????\n?????????? ????\n????????????\n?????????\n???????????????\n? ????????????\n??????????????????????????????????????????????????\nFigure 1 Illustration of hypothesized role played by goal-\nsetting and action-plan worksheet to promote increased effort\nto improve care.\nIvers et al.

Presently, all participants work in multi-provider\nclinics and nearly all have access to allied healthcare\nproviders. As a result, participants are not necessarily\nrepresentative of all Ontario family physicians or of all\nprimary care EMR users. However, this concern is par-\ntially mitigated by the varied characteristics of physi-\ncians in the sample (Table 1). As EMRALD continues to\nrecruit new family physicians, the diversity of the sample\nis expected to grow. The number of participating physi-\ncians and practices in EMRALD may grow by as much\nas 50% during the first six months of this trial.\nFor the present study, all EMRALD participants were\nsent consent forms and invitations to participate. Mini-\nmal eligibility criteria are applied. Physicians with less\nthan one year of experience with EMR or with less than\n100 rostered, active adult patients will be excluded,\nbecause these \u2018new\u2019 physicians would not have adequate\ndata to assess some of the quality indicators. To be con-\nsidered active, and to ensure there is a history with the\nphysician, patients must have at least one visit between\n12 and 36 months prior to the data upload date. The\nEMR data for all remaining physicians are assessed to\nensure completeness with respect to electronic capture\nof lab tests and prescriptions. Finally, because ICES does\nnot permit reporting of cells smaller than five (to ensure\nconfidentiality), the data for the remaining physicians\nare assessed to ensure that each has more than five\npatients with diabetes and more than five with IHD.\nSetting\nThe Ontario Health Insurance Program pays for doctor\nvisits and laboratory tests, but covers medications only\nfor the elderly or those on social assistance. Over one-\nhalf of the primary care providers in Ontario have\neschewed the old model of fee-for-service and joined\nprimary care reform models where capitation plays a\nlarge role in compensation for patient care. To earn the\ncapitation fees, physicians and patients must co-sign an\nagreement that officially adds the patient to the physi-\ncian\u2019s roster; through this process, patients are encour-\naged to seek care primarily with their own provider or\nclinic. Only data from \u2018rostered\u2019 patients are included in\nthe trial.\nAll the physician participants in this project roster\ntheir patients and most also benefit from the newest pri-\nmary care reform process that provides funds to hire\nallied healthcare providers to work in the clinic.\nAlthough less than half of Ontario family physicians use\nEMR, Practice Solutions\u00ae EMR has 45% of the Ontario\nEMR market [28].\nIntervention\nThe intervention has been developed through an itera-\ntive process. The materials for dissemination were\ndesigned after a review of the literature and consultation\nwith experts from continuing medical education, health\npsychology, and knowledge translation.\nParticipants in both arms of the trial will each receive\nan information package by courier every six months for\ntwo years with multiple components, including a one-\npage cover letter, a one-page explanation of how the\npatient information was identified from EMRALD, a\none-page handout reviewing generic clinical and quality\nimprovement strategies for patients with diabetes and\/or\nIHD (based in part on the chronic care model [29]), and\ntwo separate feedback reports. The first report will\ndescribe the percentage of the participating physician\u2019s\npatients with diabetes who are meeting evidence-based\nTable 1 Characteristics of initial 14 clinics and 54 family physicians in the trial\nClinic Characteristics (N = 14) Physician Characteristics (N = 54)\nRoster size, median (IQR) Sex, n (%)\nTotal patients\n(total N = 46,864)\n2,759 (1,915 to 4,250) Male 30 (55.6%)\nIHD or diabetes\n(total N = 4,593)\n263 (219 to 505)\nYears in Practice, n (%)\nLocation, n (%) Less than or equal to 10 17 (31.5%)\nRural 7 (50.0%) 11 to 20 12 (22.2%)\nMore than 20 25 (46.3%)\nPhysicians per clinic, n (%)\n1 to 2 5 (35.7%) Years using EMR, n (%)\n3 to 5 4 (28.6%) Less than 3 5 (9.3%)\n6 to 11 5 (35.7%) 3 to 6 45 (83.3%)\nMore than 6 4 (7.4%)\nN, n = number, IHD = ischemic heart disease, EMR = electronic medical record.\nIvers et al.

The second will present similar informa-\ntion regarding their patients with IHD. The quality tar-\ngets used were chosen to be consistent with those used\nby concurrent quality improvement interventions in\nOntario (Quality Improvement and Innovation Partner-\nship) [30] and with current guidelines (see Outcomes\nsection below). The reports will present information\ncomparing the performance achieved by the participat-\ning physician to the average achieved by the top 10% of\nparticipants for any given measure. This type of com-\nparator is similar to the achievable benchmark of care\npreviously shown to improve the effectiveness of feed-\nback reports [31]. See Additional File 1 for prototype\nfeedback reports.\nParticipants randomized to the enhanced feedback arm\nwill receive exactly the same materials as the simple feed-\nback arm, plus a one-page worksheet. This theory-\ninformed worksheet is designed to facilitate participants\nin setting specific but challenging goals and help partici-\npants develop action-plans through the creation of imple-\nmentation intentions (see Additional File 2 for prototype\nof worksheet). An evaluation to assess the theoretical\nvalidity of the intervention will be reported separately.\nBased on our review of the literature, the largest\neffects from goal setting and action planning seem to\ncome from actually developing the plan (and linking it\nto a specific context to carry it out). For this reason, we\nchose not to provide participants with a list of possible\nactions. The participants, not the investigators, decide\nhow to improve upon a care gap that they identify as\nimportant. Important mediators of the success of imple-\nmentation intentions seem to be participant adherence\nto instructions to develop an appropriate plan, partici-\npant self-efficacy, and the inclusion of \u2018coping plans\u2019 to\nhelp participants plan ahead for situations that could\ninterrupt goal-oriented behaviours [32,33]. These factors\nwill be addressed explicitly in this trial by: offering six\n\u2018Main-Pro-C\u2019 [34] continuing medical education credits\nto encourage full completion of the worksheet and to\npermit monitoring of plans by the investigators; allowing\nparticipants to set their own goals for improvement; and\nrequiring participants to develop a coping plan in the\nintervention worksheet. The format in this aspect of the\nworksheet is similar to previous studies [33], although\nto our knowledge the application of this type of inter-\nvention to family physicians is novel.\nThe worksheet in this intervention is similar in con-\ncept to commitment-to-change procedures that are\nincreasingly used in the continuing medical education\nfield, based on multiple theories related to adult learning\n[35]. Rigorous evaluations of such procedures are few,\nbut one study indicated that commitment-to-change can\nmediate the effect of an educational intervention for\nprescriptions [36]. Although a signature has not been\nproven to increase the effectiveness of the commitment-\nto-change procedure [37], it is included in the work-\nsheet because it offers an opportunity to explicitly use\nthe word \u2018commitment;\u2019 this is thought to be a neces-\nsary feature for the procedure to successfully generate\nbehaviour change (see Additional File 2 for prototype of\nworksheet) [38]. We tested the worksheet design and\nall other intervention materials with a group of non-\nparticipating family physicians and they found it easy to\nuse. Specifically, they reported that they found the\ninstructions clear and advised no changes to the design.\nTo our knowledge, the application of this type of work-\nsheet as a means of \u2018enhancing\u2019 the effectiveness of\naudit and feedback is novel.\nAllocation and blinding\nGiven the small number of practices (clusters) involved\nin EMRALD, simple randomization cannot be expected\nto generate two similar arms for this trial. Instead, mini-\nmization was used to achieve balance at baseline across\nthe three primary outcomes and the number of patients\nin each cluster who have diabetes and\/or IHD. Using\nthe baseline data for each cluster, these variables were\nclassified as high or low using the median value as the\ncut-point. This was conducted with the free software,\n\u2018MINIM\u2019 [39]. Enrolment will continue for a maximum\nof six months; new practices will be minimized using\ntheir baseline data.\nAlthough minimization has been criticised for increas-\ning the risk for selection bias [40], the benefits of\nachieving balance at baseline through the use of minimi-\nzation outweighs the minor risks involved (especially for\nsmall trials) and therefore has been widely recom-\nmended [41,42]. We believe that risk of selection bias is\nlow in this case because the recruitment of the first\nfourteen practices (clusters) was completed prior to allo-\ncation of the practices using the minimization software.\nFurthermore, allocation of practices will remain con-\ncealed; study IDs will be used to ensure that the audit\nprocess and statistical analysis will be blinded with\nregard to group assignment. A research coordinator\nwho is otherwise unaffiliated with the study will use a\nmaster list with study IDs and participant names to pre-\npare the intervention materials. Participants will not be\ntold explicitly which arm they are in; those in the\nenhanced feedback group will not be aware that the\nworksheet is the essential aspect of the intervention.\nTimeline\nThe first reports were sent out in August 2010. Every\nsix months, practices will send new data uploads to\nICES so that new feedback reports can be produced and\ndistributed. Final analysis will occur after an audit at\n24 months. See Figure 2 for cluster-flow diagram.\nIvers et al. Implementation Science 2010, 5:98\nhttp:\/\/www.implementationscience.com\/content\/5\/1\/98\nPage 5 of 10\nAnalysis\nOutcomes\nThere will be two disease primary outcomes and one\nprocess primary outcome. The disease primary out-\ncomes will be the patients\u2019 most recent LDL and systolic\nBP values, if they have been tested within 24 or\n12 months, respectively. Though these are actually risk\nfactors, they are the target of cardiovascular risk man-\nagement, and are therefore appropriate given the brevity\nof the trial.\nThe process primary outcome is a composite process\nscore indicating whether patients with diabetes and\/or\nIHD are receiving the recommended prescriptions and\ntests within the appropriate timeframes. These evidence-\nbased quality indicators are concordant with guidelines\n[43-48] and are comparable to composite scores used in\nsimilar studies [47]. All patients with diabetes and\/or\nIHD will receive a composite process score with a maxi-\nmum of 6. For patients with diabetes, a maximum score\nof 6 would indicate testing of urinary microalbumin and\nserum LDL within a year, measuring BP and glycosylated\nhaemoglobin within six months, and having active pre-\nscriptions for a statin and an angiotensin-modifying\nagent. For patients with IHD, a maximum score of 6\nwould indicate testing fasting blood glucose within two\nyears and LDL within one year, measuring BP within six\nmonths, and having active prescriptions for aspirin, a sta-\ntin, and an angiotensin-modifying agent. For patients\nwith both diabetes and IHD, the maximum raw score will\nbe 7 (based on the same indicators as diabetes but adding\naspirin), but this will then be multiplied by 6\/7 to stan-\ndardize to a maximum score of 6, as outlined in Table 2.\nSecondary outcomes were chosen because they may be\nthe targets of action by recipients of the intervention.\nThus, the secondary outcomes include: the proportion of\npatients whose results meet the targets recommended in\nguidelines for glucose, LDL, and BP; and the prescriptions\nrates for insulin, beta blockers, angiotensin-modifying\nagents, aspirin, and statins.\nAnalysis\nDescriptive statistics will be calculated for all variables of\ninterest. Continuous measures will be summarized using\nmeans and standard deviations whereas categorical mea-\nsures will be summarized using counts and percentages.\nWe hypothesize that the enhanced feedback interven-\ntion will lead to greater improvements in quality of care\nfor patients with diabetes and\/or IHD. The analysis to\ntest this hypothesis will be carried out using multilevel\nhierarchical modeling (using the generalized estimating\nequation approach) to control for the effects of cluster-\ning as well as adjusting for multiple covariates, including\nthe variables used in the minimization (baseline values\nfor BP, LDL, the composite process score, and the num-\nber of patients with diabetes and\/or IHD). Analysis will\nbe performed on an intention-to-treat basis. No interim\nanalyses are planned. Prior to analysis, other covariates\nwill be assessed for the presence of multicollinearity;\nwhen the tolerance statistic value < 0.4 only one mem-\nber of a correlated set will be retained for the model.\nPrimary analyses will be conducted on patient level vari-\nables, combining patients with diabetes and\/or IHD.\nSub-group analyses will be performed on patients with\nonly IHD, only diabetes, or both, to assess the same out-\ncome variables.\nThe efficacy of the worksheet intervention will be\nassessed as a planned secondary analysis in two ways.\nFirst, we will test whether full completion of the worksheet\nresulted in improved outcomes.

Second, we will examine if physicians\nachieved greater improvements in the specific clinical\ntopics that they chose to target using the worksheet.\nAll analyses will be carried out using the SAS Version\n9.2 statistical program (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).\nSample size\nBased on pilot data, systolic BP is expected have a stan-\ndard deviation of 20 mmHg. A clinically important dif-\nference in systolic BP is estimated to be 7 mmHg; this is\na difference often seen with initiation of treatment and\nis associated with reduction in cardiovascular risk [49].\nTo have 80% power to find a difference in systolic BP of\n7 mmHg using a two-sided unpaired t-test with a =\n0.05 would require 258 total patients. To account for\nclustering, this sample size must be multiplied by a var-\niance inflation factor (VIF) = [1 + (n - 1) \u00d7 ICC], where\nn is the mean cluster sample size and ICC is the intra-\nclass correlation coefficient, a measure of the degree of\ncorrelation within clusters [50]. From baseline data, the\nmean cluster size (number of patients with diabetes\nand\/or IHD in each practice) is approximately 328.\nUsing a presumed ICC of 0.05 (based on ICCs seen in\nthe literature[51]), the VIF equals 17.4. Thus, 4,489\npatients with diabetes and\/or IHD are required to find a\ndifference of 7 mmHg in BP, which equates to 13.7\nclusters.\nFor LDL values, pilot data show a standard deviation\nof 0.90. Therefore, using the same calculations, the trial\nwill have power to show an absolute difference in LDL\nof 0.32 mmol\/L; this difference has been shown to be\nassociated with reduction in cardiovascular risk [52].\nThis type of small improvement in the management of\nthese very common chronic diseases could translate into\na large impact on the population scale.\nBased on pilot data, the standard deviation for the\ncomposite process primary outcome is expected to be\n1.61. For this outcome, pilot data were also used to find\nthat the ICC was 0.0059, but to be conservative this can\nbe rounded up to 0.01, giving a VIF of 4.28. Therefore,\nto show an absolute difference in the final composite\nprocess score of 0.3 (effect size 0.19), a sample size of\n3,878 patients would be needed, which equates to 11.82\nclusters.\nMost of the power in cluster-trials comes from the\nnumber of clusters, rather than the number of patients.\nTherefore, dropout of a few participating physicians (or\nmany of their patients) would only minimally decrease\npower. We do not expect dropout of entire clinics; clinic\nmanagers are committed to this project and have facili-\ntated the recruitment of individual physicians at each\nclinic. However, even with a loss of two of the fourteen\nclinics, the same calculations indicate that we would\nhave 80% power to find differences of 8 mmHG BP or\n0.36 mmol\/L LDL.\nQualitative analysis and process evaluation\nPrevious qualitative studies have isolated timeliness, cus-\ntomizability, and a non-punitive tone as key criteria for\n\u2018actionable\u2019 feedback [53]. Evidence from the organiza-\ntional literature suggests that the recipient must be\nsatisfied with the feedback for it to be accepted and\nacted upon [54]. Unfortunately, the literature has not\nprovided clear direction regarding how to design feed-\nback interventions targeted at family physicians to\naccomplish this goal.\nOne previous study has assessed eight Ontarian physi-\ncians\u2019 reactions to a 20-minute one-on-one performance\nassessment presentation based on chart audits and\npatient questionnaires, and found that physicians wel-\ncomed it [55]. Even though the data were garnered\ndirectly from charts, the participants expressed concerns\nabout government involvement in the performance\nimprovement process. Another study revealed a general\nscepticism amongst physicians regarding quality\nimprovement interventions based on secondary data-\nbases [56]. Nevertheless, the MOHLTC, is now using\nadministrative data to send all family physicians \u2018Dia-\nbetes Testing Reports\u2019 regarding their patients with dia-\nbetes [57]. These reports from the government will\nprovide far less data to the physicians (and nothing\nregarding patients with IHD) compared to the interven-\ntion described in this protocol. This context provides an\nopportunity to work with physicians receiving two types\nof diabetes feedback to explore the barriers and facilita-\ntors to Ontario family physicians\u2019 acceptance and utiliza-\ntion of performance feedback, and to examine the\nperceived actionability of various approaches to the\ndesign and delivery of feedback. While the ongoing gov-\nernment feedback will likely enrich the qualitative com-\nponent of the study, we do not believe that it will\nimpact the inferences made from the trial. All partici-\npants will receive the government feedback, but the gov-\nernment feedback does not explicitly encourage goal\nsetting or action plans.\nSemi-structured, individual interviews will be con-\nducted using an interview guide, developed based on a\nreview of the literature and consideration of the twelve\ndomains described by Michie et al. to explain behaviour\nchange in response to an intervention [58]. We will use\n\u2018stratified purposeful sampling\u2019 [59]; we will select parti-\ncipants with those features believed to be relevant, not\nwith the goal of probabilistic representativeness, but for\ninformational representativeness. For instance, guideline\nadherence and quality of care may be inversely related\nIvers et al. Implementation Science 2010, 5:98\nhttp:\/\/www.implementationscience.com\/content\/5\/1\/98\nPage 7 of 10\nto years in practice [60] and physician gender [61], so\nvariety will be sought in these factors. Additionally, the\nparticipants will be chosen to represent varying levels of\nbaseline performance, because this was found to be an\nimportant predictor in the Cochrane review. It is\nexpected that saturation may be accomplished with\napproximately 12 interviews [62]. The sample will be\nweighted with about two-thirds of participants having\nreceived the enhanced feedback. To account for time\naway from patient care, an honorarium will be offered\nfor participation.\nInterviews will be recorded and a transcription service\nused to produce verbatim electronic transcripts. These\nwill be stored with encryption software on a password-\nprotected computer drive. Identifying factors will be\nomitted. NVivo\u2122 software will be used to assist with the\ndata analysis. The framework analysis approach, as\ndescribed Ritchie and Spencer [63] (and more succinctly\nby Pope et al.[64]) aims to accurately reflect the original\naccounts of the participants through the use of inductive\ntechniques, yet start out deductively with preset goals.\nAs such, it represents an ideal foundation for analyzing\nqualitative data within a pragmatic, mixed methods\nstudy such as this one. For example, it has been success-\nfully used in the past as part of a mixed method study\ninvestigating barriers and facilitators to guideline uptake\nin the ICU [65].\nThe identification of themes will be tracked along with\ndates of interpretations to provide an audit trail docu-\nmenting the analysis. This is one way that trustworthi-\nness in the results can be increased [66]. Next, an index\nof themes will be developed by combining a priori\nobjectives and issues identified in the literature with\nthose raised by the participants and recognized through\nthe readings. This process will occur after seven inter-\nviews have been completed and will be repeated in part\nby a second researcher (JB). It is thought that multiple\ncoding provides a system of check and balances to\nensure that all possible themes are given consideration\n[67]. Disagreements will be settled through consensus\nand this process may lead to changes in the interview\nguide. At this point, disconfirming evidence to ensure\nsaturation of themes will be sought from further partici-\npants through the use of snowball sampling (by asking\nparticipants to suggest colleagues that may have unique\nperspectives on feedback). In this way, elements of mul-\ntiple coding and the constant comparative method will\nbe incorporated. Therefore, the qualitative protocol will\nmeet the criteria described by Kuper for judging qualita-\ntive research [68].\nDiscussion\nWith the use of audit and feedback interventions likely\nto increase over time, there is a need to understand how\ntheir design effects the behaviour of primary care provi-\nders. This project will play a role in learning how to\ngenerate feedback reports that are useful for family phy-\nsicians. Even if the trial is negative, the qualitative pro-\ncess evaluation will provide useful information and\ngenerate new study questions. Future studies may then\ncompare the cost-effectiveness of using interventions\nsimilar to the one described in this trial against more\nintensive interventions such as academic detailing or\npractice facilitators.\nThere are also some important limitations that war-\nrant discussion. One concern regarding generalizability\nis that it is possible that there will be a specific inter-\naction between the worksheet intervention and the\nfeedback such that adding the worksheet to other\ndesigns\/types of feedback or other interventions may\nnot work as well. It is also important to note that par-\nticipants in EMRALD are a convenience sample of\nOntario family physicians using Practice Solutions\u00ae.\nTherefore, findings from this group will not be strictly\ngeneralizable to other providers who use different\nEMR systems, or to those not using EMR at all. In\naddition, many of the clinics are involved in other\nquality improvement interventions. Thus, these clinics\nmay be more innovative and may also be achieving a\nhigher level of evidence-based care than most other\nprimary care providers.\nPerceived data accuracy has been identified as an\nessential feature for acceptance of feedback reports [69],\nand previous studies have shown that data quality from\nEMRs are uncertain [70]. While we have validated algo-\nrithms for identifying patients who have diabetes and\/or\nIHD in this database, the automated chart audits that\nare the basis for both the intervention and the outcome\nassessment may occasionally have errors. However,\nthere is no reason to believe that any such errors occur-\nring in the data abstraction process represent a risk for\nbias; any problems with the algorithm would be equally\nlikely to occur in either arm of the trial.\nThis is a pragmatic trial that is powered to find small\n(but important) effects of a feedback intervention based\non the addition of a theoretically-informed worksheet.\nWhile a longer, larger trial would be ideal to assess true\ncardiovascular endpoints, the size and timeframe of this\ntrial have been designed to ensure feasibility. Psychologi-\ncal theory applicable to feedback interventions indicates\nthat the worksheet intervention tested in this trial\nshould help family physicians to close the gap between\ntheir intended and actual behaviours with respect to the\ncare they provide for their patients. If the intervention\nworks in this sample, it could be tested more broadly; if\nit is not effective, it may be necessary to try more inten-\nsive approaches to facilitate providers to achieve their\nquality improvement targets.\nIvers et al.
