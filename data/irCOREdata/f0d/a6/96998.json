Maini\ndifferent cell types, each with specialised function. Much experimental and the-\noretical research has been dedicated to elucidating the mechanisms underlying\ndevelopment: such mechanisms must be sufficiently robust to cope with genetic\nvariation and environmental noise; yet able to create the kind of fine-detailed\npatterning observed in the fully-developed embryo.\nThe role of morphogens in development has been long since documented:\na widely accepted definition of a morphogen is that of a diffusible substance\nwhich provides spatial and temporal information during development via a\nconcentration gradient. Wolpert [28] first proposed this mechanism for pattern-\ning in 1969 using his positional information model: he supposes a morphogen\nproduced at a localised source diffuses across a target field to set up an extracel-\nlular gradient. Cells determine their position within the field by interpretation\nof the morphogen gradient, activating specific programs of differentiation at\ndiscrete morphogen thresholds. In this way we see that pattern formation using\npositional information relies on two mechanisms: (i) specification of the posi-\ntional information via amorphogen gradient; (ii) interpretation of the positional\ninformation by cells in the morphogenetic field [29].\nMorphogen gradients play important roles in numerous developmental\nmechanisms: neuronal cell fate in the developing central nervous system (CNS)\nis controlled by gradients of Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) [3]; formation of the\ndorsal\u2013ventral (DV) axis in Drosophila is controlled by gradients of Screw\n(Scw) and Decapentaplegic (Dpp) [8,17,27]; antero-posterior (AP) patterning\nin the chick wing is controlled by a gradient of Shh arising from a polarising\nregion at the posterior edge of the limb bud [24]; to name but a few.\nMuch of our knowledge about morphogen gradients has come from exper-\nimental observations on the invertebrate Drosophila and several morphogen\ngradients have been identified as crucial toDrosophila development. Alongside\nthe aforementioned role of Dpp: Bicoid is known to be the primary determi-\nnant of anterior body pattern [14]; Hunchback has been shown to play a role in\ninducing striped gene expression in the posterior half of the embryo [14]; and\nDpp has been shown to act in a concentration-dependent manner to activate\nvarious target genes in the Drosophila wing disc [26].\nCorrespondingly there has beenmuch theoretical investigation of the forma-\ntion and robustness of morphogen gradients in Drosophila (see, for theoretical\nmodels, [2,7,10,11,13]). In particular, Lander and co-workers [12,13] discuss\nthe mechanisms via which a stable gradient of Dpp may be maintained in the\nwing disc, exploring the possible roles of receptor binding, internalisation and\nendocytosis, and ligand diffusion in creating long range gradients.\nMore recently, it has been demonstrated that a gradient of Dpp is respon-\nsible for controlling growth in the Drosophila wing disc [19,18,21] and it is\nthis phenomenon in which we will be interested in this paper. In [21], Rogulja\nand co-workers report on the use of two mechanisms for controlling domain\ngrowth: the first relies on the juxtaposition of cells with different levels of Dpp\nactivity, so that cell proliferation only occurs in a region where the Dpp gradi-\nent is suitably steep; the second relies on reduced Dpp activity (away from the\nmorphogen source) and the corresponding upregulation of brinker [18].\nA mechanism for morphogen-controlled domain growth 599\n1.1 Aims and outline\nAlthough there have been many models describing Dpp gradient formation\nand maintenance, we are not familiar with any which address the role of this\nmorphogen in driving cell proliferation and hence domain growth. The aim\nof this paper is to establish an initial model to describe Dpp activity in the\nDrosophila wing disc and the resulting growth of the disc. The mathematical\nframework developed in this paper will, in the future, allow us to investigate\nkey unanswered questions surrounding this mechanism of domain growth and\ntomake experimental predictions which could be used to further understanding\nin the area.\nTo model the phenomena outlined above we will use a system of reaction-\ndiffusion equations, with advection arising as a result of the flow generated by\ncell proliferation in the wing. In Sect. 2 we outline the experimental evidence:\ndetailing the biochemical pathways which are involved in Dpp gradient forma-\ntion and maintenance, and the mechanisms via which this gradient leads to cell\nproliferation. In Sect. 3 we outline the main mathematical techniques that will\nbe used to model the Dpp gradient in Sect. 4. We solve the model numerically\nand in Sect. 5 wemake some simplifying approximations which allow us to apply\nanalytical techniques to the model. We conclude in Sect. 6 with a discussion of\nthe model and outline future work and ideas.\n2 The role of Dpp in Drosophila wing growth\nThe Drosophila wing begins life as a disc of about 40 cells which grows, over the\nspan of about four days, into a monolayered epithelial sac consisting of around\n50,000 cells [21]. A number of genes are known to play roles in patterning and\nshaping the disc and one such gene is Dpp [6,18,19,22].\nDpp is produced along the AP compartment boundary (see Fig. 1) and it\nspreads out from its site of synthesis, thereby forming a gradient. As mentioned\nin Sect. 1, thisDpp gradient has recently been shown to control cell proliferation\nin the wing: in medial regions of the wing, close to the AP compartment bound-\nary, the gradient of Dpp activity is steep and Rogulja and co-workers report\nthat this juxtaposition of cells experiencing different levels of Dpp activity is\nnecessary and sufficient for cell proliferation [21]. In more lateral regions of the\nwing, low levels of Dpp are unable to repress brinker activity and this also leads\nto cell proliferation [18,21]. It has been shown that: growth occurs uniformly\nacross the wing; Dpp mutants show severly impaired growth; overexpression of\nDpp promotes wing overgrowth; and clonal activation can change the growth\nregions within the disc [21].\nTheDpp receptor, Thickveins (Tkv), has been shown to play a role in shaping\nthe Dpp gradient: Dpp binds reversibly to Tkv and once bound it is unable to\ndiffuse but can be internalised and degraded, or subject to endocytotic traffick-\ning [9,23]. Dpp, on the other hand, has been shown to negatively regulate Tkv\nreceptor expression [15]. Tkv also plays a major role in transducing the Dpp\n600 R. E. Baker, P. K. Maini\nFig. 1 An illustration of the Drosophila wing disc. The AP compartment boundary is indicated by\nthe dashed line and the source of Dpp by the shaded strip following the compartment boundary.\nDpp diffuses from its site of synthesis into both compartments, in a medial to lateral direction. The\nanterior compartment lies to the left-hand side of the boundary and the posterior compartment to\nthe right-hand side. x marks the growth axis considered in Sect. 3.3 and l(t) marks the position of\nthe disc boundary\nsignal by phosphorylating the major signal transducer Mothers against Dpp\n(Mad), which then translocates into the nucleus [9,22,25].\nOpposing views exist as to the importance of diffusion versus endocytotic\ntrafficking and the rate of gradient formation (possibly limited due to space\nconstrictions and the level of Tkv receptors). The implications of these factors\nwith respect to modelling this phenomena will be discussed in Sect. 6.\n3 Modelling reaction-diffusion systems on growing domains\nHere we outline some of the main mathematical techniques that will be used to\nmodel the Dpp gradient in this work. We will use a system of partial differential\nequations (PDEs) to describe the dynamics of the ligand Dpp, and the free and\nbound forms of its receptor, Tkv. We will outline derivation of the flow gener-\nated in the wing disc due to growth and suggest a suitable frame of reference\nfor analysing our models.\n3.1 Derivation of evolution equations\nFollowing Crampin and co-workers [4], we consider the evolution of n chemical\nspecies c1, . . . , cn reacting and diffusing on a time-varying domain \u0001(t). For any\nelemental volume V(t) in the domain \u0001(t) we can write down the following\nsystem of conservation equations:\nd\ndt\n\u222b\nV(t)\nc(x, t)dx =\n\u222b\nV(t)\n[\n\u2212\u2207.j + R(c)\n]\ndx, (1)\nA mechanism for morphogen-controlled domain growth 601\nwhere c is a column vector of length n representing chemicals c1, . . . , cn. j is\nthe flux and R the reaction term, which includes production and decay as well\nas interactions between the individual chemicals. Via the Reynolds Transport\nTheorem [1], the left-hand side of Eq. (1) can be evaluated to give\nd\ndt\n\u222b\nV(t)\nc(x, t)dx =\n\u222b\nV(t)\n[\n\u2202c\n\u2202t\n+ \u2207.(a c)\n]\ndx, (2)\nwhere a(x, t) is the flow due to domain growth.\nThese results hold for any elemental volume V(t) moving in the flow and so\nwe argue that they must hold everywhere in the volume\u0001(t). Assuming Fickian\nflux, j = \u2212D\u2207c where D is a diagonal matrix representing the diffusivities of\nindividual chemicals, we arrive at the following system of evolution equations:\n\u2202c\n\u2202t\n+ \u2207.(a c) = D\u22072c + R(c), x \u2208 \u0001(t), t \u2208 [0,\u221e). (3)\nThe system is closed by specifying initial and boundary conditions of the form\nc(x, 0) = c0(x) and \u0003(x, t)\n\u2202c\n\u2202n\n+ \u0004(x, t)c = \u0005(x, t) for x \u2208 \u2202\u0001(t), (4)\nwhere \u2202c\/\u2202n = n\u02c6.\u2207c and n\u02c6 is the unit normal to the boundary \u2202\u0001(t).\nIn Eq. (3) we see that the effect of domain growth is to introduce two extra\nterms into the problem: a.\u2207c, an advection term representing the transport of\nmaterial around \u0001(t) at a rate determined by the flow a; and c\u2207.a, a diluting (or\nconcentrating) term due to local volume expansion (contraction) [5].\n3.2 Determination of the flow and the Lagrangian formulation\nIn some cases the flow may be specified directly, see for example [4], but in the\nbiological context under consideration here, the growth (and hence flow) rate\nwill depend on local values of the chemical constituents reacting on the domain.\nCrampin and co-workers [4,5] demonstrate that the Lagrangian description is\nparticularly suitable for this purpose: it allows for the tracking of elemental vol-\numes throughout the tissue. We choose to work with Lagrangian coordinates\n(X, t), such that X is the initial position of an element moving in the flow, a, and\nuse a growth function which is directly related to the Lagrangian description:\nx = \u0006(X, t), x \u2208 \u0001(t), (5)\nwith an initial condition given by \u0006(X, 0) = X. Since solid body rotations and\ntranslations do not alter growth rates we ignore them, allowing us to specify\n602 R. E. Baker, P. K. Maini\n\u0006(0, t) = 0. The local flow is then given by\na(X, t) = \u2202x\n\u2202t\n= \u2202\u0006\n\u2202t\n. (6)\nLocal growth The deformation due to growth can be described by the local\nstress tensor Lij [4,5,16]. Here we will ignore the antisymmetric part, Wij, of Lij\nwhich corresponds to rigid body rotations and as such has no effect on the chem-\nical pattern, and concentrate on the symmetric part, Dij, which corresponds to\nthe rate of strain tensor. The diagonal elements represent the rate of extension\nalong axis xi and the off-diagonal elements the rate of shear between axes. The\nrate of volume expansion in n spatial dimensions is given by [4,5]:\nn\u2211\ni=1\nDii = \u2207.a = S(X, t). (7)\nFollowing [5] we take\nDij = \u2202ai\n\u2202xj\n\u21d2 \u2202\n2\u0006i\n\u2202t\u2202Xk\n=\nn\u2211\nj=1\n\u2202ai\n\u2202xj\n\u2202\u0006j\n\u2202Xk\n, (8)\nwhich allows calculation of \u0006(X, t) and a(X, t).\n3.3 Domain growth in one spatial dimension\nIn one spatial dimension the problem simplifies somewhat: we have x = \u0006(X, t)\nand\n\u22022\u0006\n\u2202t\u2202X\n= \u2202a\n\u2202x\n\u2202\u0006\n\u2202X\n= S(X, t) \u2202\u0006\n\u2202X\n. (9)\nThe original model, given by Eq. (3), reduces to the following:\n\u2202c\n\u2202t\n+ a(X(x, t), t) \u2202c\n\u2202x\n= D \u2202\n2c\n\u2202x2\n+ R(c) \u2212 S(X(x, t), t)c, (10)\n\u22022\u0006\n\u2202t\u2202X\n= S(X, t) \u2202\u0006\n\u2202X\n. (11)\nThe solution is defined for x \u2208 [0, l(t)] where l(t) = \u0006(l(0), t).\n3.4 Lagrangian coordinate system in one spatial dimension\nInherent in the above formulation is the fact that we are able to invert \u0006(X, t) in\norder to calculate a(X(x, t), t) and S(X(x, t), t) (See Eqs. (3) and (10)). In many\nA mechanism for morphogen-controlled domain growth 603\nsuch systems this may not be possible and it may be much simpler to carry out\nanalysis in the Lagrangian coordinate system [4,5]. Letting (x, t) \u0005\u2192 (X, t) the\none-dimensional system becomes\n\u2202c\n\u2202t\n= D 1\n\u0006X\n\u2202\n\u2202X\n(\n1\n\u0006X\n\u2202c\n\u2202X\n)\n+ R(c) \u2212 S(X, t)c, (12)\n\u22022\u0006\n\u2202t\u2202X\n= S(X, t) \u2202\u0006\n\u2202X\n, (13)\nwhere the solution is defined for X \u2208 [0, l(0)]. Initial conditions are of the form\nc(0, t) = c0, \u0006(X, 0) = X, (14)\nand boundary conditions\n\u0003(x, t)\n\u2202c\n\u2202n\n+ \u0004(x, t).c = \u0005(x, t), \u0006(0, t) = 0. (15)\nThe solution can be recovered on the growing domain by scaling the solution\nalong the trajectories \u0006(X, t).\n4 Initial Dpp model\nAs outlined in Sect. 1.1, we will be interested in modelling the interaction of\nthe ligand Dpp with its receptor Tkv, and we will use the observations and\ntechniques outlined in Sects. 2 and 3 to do this. Following the experimental\nobservations outlined in Sect. 2, we will assume that Dpp is secreted at the AP\ncompartment boundary of the wing, whereupon it diffuses, creating a gradient\nin Dpp concentration along the medial-lateral axis of the wing (See Fig. 1).\nDpp binds to Tkv receptors on the cell surface, and in this bound state it can-\nnot diffuse. Here we will ignore endocytotic trafficking but assume that in its\nbound state (Dpp\u2013Tkv) the receptor may be internalised and undergo decay.\nThe association and dissociation rates of Dpp and Tkv binding are assumed to\nfollow the Law of Mass action such that:\nDpp + Tkv k1\u0001\nk\u22121\nDpp\u2013Tkv. (16)\nGrowth of the wing results from cell proliferation, which is controlled by a\ncombination of the concentrations of Dpp ligand and free Tkv receptors. Let-\nting d denote Dpp concentration, r denote Tkv concentration and b denote\nDpp\u2013Tkv concentration we propose the following model to describe Dpp and\n604 R. E. Baker, P. K.

Both d and b are assumed to undergo linear decay. The terms f and\ng describe the production and decay rates of the receptor, Tkv, and possible\nforms for these will be suggested in Sect. 4.1. The system holds for x \u2208 \u0001(t)with\ninitial conditions\nd(x, 0) = d0(x), r(x, 0) = r0(x), b(x, 0) = b0(x), (20)\nand boundary conditions of the form\n\u0003(x, t)\n\u2202d\n\u2202n\n+ \u0004(x, t)d = \u0005(x, t), \u2202b\n\u2202n\n= 0 and \u2202r\n\u2202n\n= 0 on \u2202\u0001(t). (21)\nThe boundary condition for d is chosen such that d takes a constant value, d1,\nalong the AP edge of the wing and satisfies zero flux boundary conditions on\nthe remainder of the domain.\n4.1 Growth rates\nFollowing [21] we suppose that there are two mechanisms via which cell divi-\nsion (and hence wing growth) may occur. Rogulja and co-workers observe\nexperimentally that the juxtaposition of cells which have different levels of\nDpp activity is necessary and sufficient for cell proliferation in the Drosophila\nwing [21]. We therefore suppose that the magnitude of the gradient of Dpp\nmust lie above a certain threshold level in order to initiate cell proliferation.\nThis suggests that the mechanism will only promote growth in medial regions\nof the wing, where the gradient of Dpp activity is likely to be steeper.\nThe second observation made in [21] is that Dpp activity can also promote\ncell proliferation in a cell autonomous manner, and they suggest that this is\nvia the Brinker pathway. They observe that the response is localised to lateral\nregions of the wing where the level of Dpp activity is low. We therefore suggest\nthat cell proliferation will also be promoted by a high level of unbound Tkv\nreceptor (as this will correspond with a low Dpp activity level).\nTaking the above experimental evidence into account, we suggest the follow-\ning form for the local strain rate, in n spatial dimensions and in (x, t) coordinates:\nA mechanism for morphogen-controlled domain growth 605\nS(x, t) =\nn\u2211\ni=1\n\td,iH\n(\n\u2212 \u2202d\n\u2202xi\n(x, t) \u2212 d\u2217\n)\n+ \tr,iH\n(\nr(x, t) \u2212 r\u2217) , (22)\nwhere \td,i, \tr,i (for i = 1, . . . ,n), d\u2217 and r\u2217 are positive constants and H is the\nHeaviside function. In other words, we see growth only if either the gradient\nin Dpp is above a threshold level or if the concentration of unbound recep-\ntors is above a threshold level. These correspond to the positional information\nthresholds specified in Wolpert\u2019s model [28]. In one spatial dimension we can\ntransform to Lagrangian coordinates so that:\nS(X, t) = \tdH(\u2212dX(X, t)\/\u0006X(X, t) \u2212 d\u2217) + \trH(r(X, t) \u2212 r\u2217). (23)\nWe note here that there may be a limiting strain rate, arising from a biological\nconstraint such as cell cycle time, for the rate of cell proliferation. In this way, if\nthe sum of the strain rates \td + \tr is greater than this limiting rate, it would be\nmore realistic to take some other form for S (such as the maximal strain rate,\nfor example). Although not considered here, this will be taken into account in\nfuture work and when considering biologically realistic parameters.\n4.2 Functional forms for f and g\nWe assume that Tkv receptor production displays an inverse relationship to the\nnumber of receptors present on a cell. Hence possible forms for f are\nf (r,b,d) = \u03c1R\nn1\nmax\n(b + r)n1 + Rn1max\nand f (r,b,d) = \u03c1\n(\n1 \u2212 b + r\n2Rmax\n)\n, (24)\nwhere \u03c1,Rmax and n1 are positive constants. In both cases f is a decreasing func-\ntion of r and b. The factor of two in the second option is chosen for comparison:\nb + r = Rmax \u21d2 f = \u03c1\/2 in each case. Plots of f are shown in Fig. 2a.\nIt has also been shown experimentally [15] that Dpp enhances the degrada-\ntion of the ligand Tkv. In this way we suggest the following forms for g:\ng(r,b,d) = \u03b2r\n(\n1 + \u03c3d\nn2\nhn2 + dn2\n)\nand g(r,b,d) = \u03b2r\n(\n1 + \u03c3\n2h\nd\n)\n, (25)\nwhere \u03c3 , \u03b2, h and n2 are positive constants. In contrast, g is an increasing func-\ntion of d. We retain the factor of two to ensure that in each case d = h \u21d2\nf = \u03b2r (1 + \u03c3\/2). We make the short note here that it may be more biologically\nrealistic to suppose that the bound form of Dpp enhances the degradation of\nTkv: in this case b should replace d in Eq. (25). This will be investigated in\nfuture work, but in any case, should not make a significant difference to the\nmodel results. Plots of g are shown in Fig. 2b.\n606 R. E. Baker, P. K.

Dpp is secreted uniformly along the AP compartment boundary in a\nstripe running in a DV direction [23], See Fig. 1. We ignore the axis running\nperpendicular to the surface shown in Fig. 1 as the wing consists of a single\nlayer of cells in this direction. Since Dpp is also expressed in a stripe along\nthe DV axis, we assume that there will be little change in Dpp activity in the\nDV direction and so we also ignore this axis. Along the AP axis, the domain is\nalmost symmetric about the AP compartment boundary and Dpp is secreted\ninto both compartments. In this way we will model Tkv activity in one spatial\ndimension; out from the AP compartment boundary, in a posterior direction,\nalong the AP axis. We can consider growth in the anterior compartment as\nmirroring growth in the posterior compartment. The region close to the AP\ncompartment boundary is known as the medial region, and that close to the\nedge of the wing disc as the lateral region.\nEquations (17)\u2013(19) can therefore be written\n\u2202d\n\u2202t\n+ \u2202(ad)\n\u2202x\n= D \u2202\n2d\n\u2202x2\n\u2212 k1dr + k\u22121b \u2212 \u03b1d, (26)\n\u2202r\n\u2202t\n+ \u2202(ar)\n\u2202x\n= \u2212k1dr + k\u22121b + f (r,b,d) \u2212 g(r,b,d), (27)\n\u2202b\n\u2202t\n+ \u2202(ab)\n\u2202x\n= k1dr \u2212 k\u22121b \u2212 \u03b3b, (28)\nfor x \u2208 \u0001(t), where \u0001(t) = [0, l(t)].

The curvature of the fourth trajectory indicates that the boundary\nof the growth region lies approximately between x = 0.5 and x = 0.625. In this case \td = 0.0.\nb Growth due to the gradient in Dpp. A linear trajectory indicates a region in which local domain\ngrowth is not occurring. In this case we see that growth occurs initially throughout the domain,\nbut as the domain expands lateral areas leave the growing region. Here \tr = 0.0. In both cases\nthe initial points of the trajectories are evenly spaced along the interval [0, 1]. Here we use the\nfirst forms for f and g from Eqs. (38) and (39). Unless otherwise stated parameters are as follows:\nD = 1.0, k1 = 5.0, k\u22121 = 0.1, \t = 1.0, \u03b1 = 10.0, \u03c1 = 0.8, \u03b2 = 0.2, \u03c3 = 10.0, h = 0.5, d\u2217 = 0.01,\nr\u2217 = 0.9, \td = 0.005 and \tr = 0.005\nby the number of bound Tkv receptors and opposed by a gradient of unbound\nTkv receptors, as observed experimentally.\nFigure 5 shows numerical approximations of the model, with growth due\nto the absolute level and growth due to the gradient considered separately.\nFigure 5a demonstrates domain growth arising with growth due to the level\nof Dpp. The bottom three trajectories are horizontal showing the absence of\ngrowth in a region close to x = 0. Figure 5b demonstrates domain growth aris-\ning due to the gradient of Dpp activity. The upper trajectories quickly become\nparallel to one another indicating that lateral regions of the disc quickly move\nout of the region where growth occurs, whilst regions initially lying close to\nx = 0 continue to expand over a much longer time period.\nInherent in our construction of the model is the assumption that growth,\nwhen it does occur, is regionally uniform at either rate 0, \td, \tr or \td + \tr,\ndepending on the region of the wing in which a cell is sitting. Experimental\nobservations suggest that domain growth is uniform across the wing disc [21]\nand in turn, this suggests that growth due to the gradient in Dpp must occur at\na similar rate to growth due to the level of Tkv receptors. Hence in our model\nwe have assumed that the parameters \td and \tr have similar magnitudes. We\nalso note here that, at present, none of our parameter choices are informed by\nexperimental data. One objective for the future is to obtain, as a far as possible,\nexperimentally measured parameter values.\nNumerical simulations of the model suggest that such growth results in an\nexponentially increasing domain size. One observation that should be noted is\nA mechanism for morphogen-controlled domain growth 611\nthat if there is no growth due to the level of unbound Tkv receptors, only due\nto the Dpp gradient, then after an initial period, the global (rather than local)\ngrowth of the disc occurs at a uniform rate: cells proliferate and are displaced\n(due to growth) at an exponential rate until they reach the region where the\nDpp gradient is no longer steep enough to stimulate proliferation. The result\nis that the lateral boundary of the wing moves at a constant rate. At this point,\na trajectory becomes a straight line in (x, t)-space, parallel to the trajectories\npreceding it: this is an indication of zero growth in a region. We also note that\nuniform growth across the disc will obviously only be achieved if there is a\nnear correlation in the boundaries of the regions in which growth due to each\nmechanism occurs. We will discuss these matters further in Sect. 5.\n5 Simplification of the model\nAlthough the model developed in the Sect. 4 displays the behaviour observed\nin vivo for the parameter values listed in Figs. 3 and 4, and for a range of other\nvalues not shown here, the system is not particularly amenable to analytical\nexploration and as such it is difficult to gain further insight into the growth\nprocesses involved. In the absence of any approximate parameter values\/ratios\nwith which to simplify the model, we make some heuristic approximations (See\nSect. 6 for more discussion of these matters). Firstly, we note that the gradient\nin Dpp decays exponentially across the wing disc, that this gradient is mirrored\nby a gradient in bound receptor Dpp\u2013Tkv, and is opposite to the gradient of\nunbound receptor, Tkv. Therefore we propose a model in which a Dpp concen-\ntration gradient regulates both types of growth, i.e. where the slope of the Dpp\ngradient regulates growth in medial regions of the disc and the absolute value\nof Dpp regulates growth laterally.\nIn order to do this, we consider the evolution of a single chemical, c, on a\none-dimensional, growing domain in which growth is controlled by c itself. In\nline with the previous system, we suppose that c is secreted at the boundary\nof the domain given by x = 0 and that within the domain, it diffuses and\nundergoes linear decay. We consider the following non-dimensional evolution\nequation for c:\n\u2202c\n\u2202t\n+ \u2202(ac)\n\u2202x\n= D \u2202\n2c\n\u2202x2\n\u2212 \u03bbc, (49)\nfor x \u2208 [0, l(t)], with boundary conditions: c(0, t) = 1 and \u2202c\/\u2202x(1, t) = 0. The\ninitial conditions are l(0) = 1 and c(x, 0) = c0(x). c0(x) is found by considering\nthe steady state gradient formed on a static domain of length l(0) = 1:\nc0(x) = 1e\u03b2 + e\u2212\u03b2\n[\ne\u03b2(x\u22121) + e\u2212\u03b2(x\u22121)\n]\n, x \u2208 [0, 1], (50)\nwhere \u03b2 = \u221a\u03bb\/D.\n612 R.

The former corresponds to growth due to a gradient\nin d above the threshold and the latter due to r levels remaining above the\nthreshold.\nIn Lagrangian coordinates, we have\n\u2202c\n\u2202t\n= D 1\n\u0006X\n\u2202\n\u2202X\n(\n1\n\u0006X\n\u2202c\n\u2202X\n)\n\u2212 \u03bbc \u2212 S(X, t)c, (52)\n\u2202\n\u2202t\n(\n\u2202\u0006\n\u2202X\n)\n= S(X, t) \u2202\u0006\n\u2202X\n, (53)\nwhere\nS(X, t) = \u03b1gH(\u2212cX(X, t)\/\u0006X \u2212 cg) + \u03b1aH(1 \u2212 c(X, t) \u2212 ca), (54)\nand X \u2208 [0, 1].\nThe numerical approximation can be found, as before, by employing the\nNAG routine D03PEF and the results are shown in Fig. 6. The plots show sim-\nilar results to the full model: a chemical gradient across the domain results in\nexponential growth of the domain. Although variation of cg and ca can result in\nregions of the disc in which there is no growth, the trajectories in Fig. 6 indicate\nthat in this case growth occurs across most of the disc.\n0 100 200 300 400 500\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\nDomain growth\nTime (t)\nx=\n\u0393(X\n,t)\n0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nx=\u0393(X,t)\nCo\nnc\nen\ntra\ntio\nn\nConcentration profile(a) (b)\nFig. 6 Numerical solution for the reducedmodel as given by Eqs.

This can be verified by numerical computation (not shown here)\nand we will use this in order to facilitate analysis of the model.\nThe limiting case described above can be considered mathematically by\nassuming that \u03b1a,\u03b1g,\u03b2 \t 1. In this case wemay assume that a(X, t),S(X, t) \t 1\nand, from Eq. (50), that the chemical concentration is in a steady state which is\ngiven approximately by\nc(x, t) = e\u2212\u03b2x. (55)\nIn order to calculate the rate of domain growth, we must therefore solve the\nequation\n\u2202\n\u2202t\n(\n\u2202\u0006\n\u2202X\n)\n= S(X, t) \u2202\u0006\n\u2202X\n, (56)\nwith\nS(X, t) = \u03b1gH(\u03b2e\u2212\u03b2\u0006 \u2212 cg) + \u03b1aH(1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03b2\u0006 \u2212 ca), (57)\nand initial and boundary conditions \u0006(X, 0) = X and \u0006(0, t) = 0, respectively.\nWe first note that there are three regions, each with different growth rates,\nand that we must solve in each region separately (See Fig. 7). Taking\nxg = 1\n\u03b2\nlog\n(\n\u03b2\ncg\n)\nand xa = 1\n\u03b2\nlog\n(\n1\n1 \u2212 ca\n)\n, (58)\nWith overlapPerfect JoinNo overlap(a) (b) (c)\nFig. 7 The different possible regions of growth in the reduced model. a No overlap: growth occurs\nin the region x < xg at rate \u03b1g and in the region x > xa at rate \u03b1a. b Perfect join: growth occurs in\nthe region x < xs at rate \u03b1g and in the region x > xs at rate \u03b1a. c With overlap: growth occurs in\nthe region x < xa at rate \u03b1g, in the region xa < x < xg at rate \u03b1a + \u03b1g and in the region x > xg at\nrate \u03b1a\n614 R. E. Baker, P. K. Maini\nthen xg represents the point at which the gradient drops below the threshold\nlevel, cg, needed for domain growth at rate \u03b1g and xa represents the point at\nwhich c drops below the threshold level, 1 \u2212 ca, required for domain growth at\nrate \u03b1a. As shown in Fig. 7, there are three different possibilities for the model\n(depending on the values of ca and cg) and we discuss each below.\n5.1.1 Case I\nInitially we will assume that xg < xa as in Fig. 7a: in which case we have the\nfollowing\n\u2202\n\u2202t\n(\n\u2202\u0006\n\u2202X\n)\n=\n\u23a7\u23aa\u23a8\n\u23aa\u23a9\n\u03b1g\n\u2202\u0006\n\u2202X for \u0006(X, t) < xg,\n0 for xg < \u0006(X, t) < xa,\n\u03b1a\n\u2202\u0006\n\u2202X for \u0006(X, t) > xa.\n(59)\nInitially X < xg: Whilst \u0006(X, 0) = X < xg\n\u2202\n\u2202t\n(\n\u2202\u0006\n\u2202X\n)\n= \u03b1g \u2202\u0006\n\u2202X\n, (60)\nwith \u0006(X, 0) = X and \u0006(0, t) = 0. This equation can be solved trivially to give\n\u0006(X, t) = Xe\u03b1gt, (61)\nwhich holds until \u0006(X, t) = xg, at time\nt = tg(X) = 1\n\u03b1g\nlog\n(xg\nX\n)\n. (62)\nWhilst xg < \u0006(X, t) < xa,\n\u2202\n\u2202t\n(\n\u2202\u0006\n\u2202X\n)\n= 0, (63)\nwith \u0006(X, tg(X)) = xg. However, this equation as it stands cannot be solved\nuniquely (as for the region X < xg) since we cannot specify a boundary condi-\ntion. Instead we appeal to a solution from \u2018first principles\u2019: suppose we divide\nthe spatial region [0, xg] into N intervals of width \u03b4x and the temporal region\n[tg, t] into i intervals of width \u03b4t. Over the first time step \u03b4t each region \u03b4x\nexpands to fill a region of width \u03b4x(1 + \u03b1g\u03b4t). Summing over all the regions \u03b4x\nwe see that at time t = tg + \u03b4t the point xg has moved to x\u2032 = xg(1 + \u03b1g\u03b4t).\nApplying this reasoning repeatedly we see the following mappings for the point\nxg over successive time steps \u03b4t:\nA mechanism for morphogen-controlled domain growth 615\nxg \u0005\u2192 x\u2032 = xg(1 + \u03b1g\u03b4t), (64)\nx\u2032 \u0005\u2192 x\u2032\u2032 = xg[1 + \u03b1g\u03b4t + \u03b1g\u03b4t], (65)\n...\n...\nxi\u22121 \u0005\u2192 xi = xg[1 + i\u03b1g\u03b4t], (66)\nwhere xk indicates the position of the point xg after k time steps of length \u03b4t.\nNoting i\u03b4t = t \u2212 tg(X) and taking the limit as \u03b4t \u2192 0 we see that\n\u0006(X, t) = xg + \u03b1gxg[t \u2212 tg(X)]. (67)\nThis holds until \u0006(X, t) = xa, at time\nt = ta(X) = tg(X) + 1\n\u03b1gxg\n(xa \u2212 xg). (68)\nFor \u0006(X, t) > xa,\n\u2202\n\u2202t\n(\n\u2202\u0006\n\u2202X\n)\n= \u03b1a \u2202\u0006\n\u2202X\n, (69)\nwith \u0006(X, ta(X)) = xa. Once again, we cannot specify a boundary condition\nand so we derive a solution from \u2018first principles\u2019: initially dividing the temporal\nregion [ta, t] up into i intervals of width \u03b4t. Using the previous result we see that\nover the first time step \u03b4t, xa is mapped to x\u2032 = xa + \u03b1gxg\u03b4t.\nFor the next time step \u03b4t we divide the spatial region [xa, x\u2032] up into N inter-\nvals of width \u03b4x and note that each expands to width \u03b4x(1 + \u03b1a\u03b4t). In this way,\nwe see that\nx\u2032 \u0005\u2192x\u2032\u2032 = \u03b1a + \u03b1gxg\u03b4t + (x\u2032 \u2212 xa)(1 + \u03b1a\u03b4t). (70)\nThis is shown in Fig. 8. Continuing in this manner, we have the following map-\npings:\nxa \u0005\u2192 x\u2032 = xa + \u03b1gxg\u03b4t, (71)\nx\u2032 \u0005\u2192 x\u2032\u2032 = xa + \u03b1gxg\u03b4t + \u03b1gxg\u03b4t(1 + \u03b1a\u03b4t), (72)\n...\n...\nxi\u22121 \u0005\u2192 xi = xa + \u03b1gxg\u03b4t\ni\u22121\u2211\nk=0\n(1 + \u03b1a\u03b4t)k.

The region\n[x\u2032, xa] is then divided into N\nintervals of width \u03b4x: over the\ntime step \u03b4t each one grows to\nfill a region of width\n\u03b4x(1 + \u03b1a\u03b4t) etc\nfrom which it can be shown that\n\u0006(X, t) = xa + \u03b1gxg\n\u03b1a\n[\ne\u03b1a(t\u2212ta(X)) \u2212 1\n]\n.

We divide the spatial interval [xa,X] into N intervals of\nwidth \u03b4x and the temporal interval [0, t] into i intervals of width \u03b4t. Over the\nA mechanism for morphogen-controlled domain growth 617\nfirst time step \u03b4t each interval \u03b4x expands to width \u03b4x(1 + \u03b1a\u03b4t).

We can also confirm that if there is only growth\ndue to the slope of the Dpp gradient then domain growth will in fact be linear.\nIt is only due to growth via the levels of unbound Tkv receptor that exponential\ndomain growth occurs: this is something that could be used to understand the\ngrowth mechanisms more fully and we discuss this in Sect. 6.\nIt should also be noted that the approximations tend to slightly over predict\ngrowth (See Fig. 9b). This result arises since our approximation assumes that\nthe gradient is in a steady state given by c(x) = exp(\u2212\u03b2x), when in fact the\ninitial gradient is less steep, being given by Eq. (50). This leads to a slight over\nprediction in the number of cells that are able to proliferate due to the gradient\ninDpp and hence over prediction of the domain size. The errors are lessmarked\nin Case II and in Case III.\nFinally, we remark that in order to achieve uniform domain growth through-\nout the disc we have two crucial requirements: the first is that when cell\nproliferation does occur, it does so at an almost constant rate (so that \u03b1a \u2248 \u03b1g);\nand the second is that ca and cg must be such that the disc remains close to Case\nII (so that we have an almost perfect join between the regions).\n6 Discussion\nIn this paper we have presented an initial model that can be used to study\ngrowth of the Drosophila wing disc due to an activity gradient of Dpp. We have\n620 R.

Case II: cs = 0.8;\nCase III: ca = 0.7, cg = 0.7\nused a system of coupled reaction-diffusion equations with an advection term\nthat describes flow generated in the disc due to cell proliferation. We used a\nLagrangian formulation in order to approximate the model numerically and\nshowed that it can generate an exponentially growing wing disc (or in certain\ncases, a linearly expanding disc). In order to facilitate further analysis, we sim-\nplified the model, using a single equation to describe Dpp dynamics. Using this\nmodel we were able to find analytical approximations for the rate of growth of\nthe disc and track the movement of cells within the growing domain.\nThe phenomena observed by Rogulja and co-workers [21] and modelled in\nthe present paper provides one of the most obvious examples in which devel-\nopment is regulated by a threshold response to a morphogen concentration.\nAlthough this is an initial model to explain the observed growth phenomena\nit throws up a number of interesting questions for future work. We describe\nbelow a number of avenues that we feel are worthy of future exploration.\nFirstly, the extension of the disc boundary is an observable that should be\nmeasurable at a number of points over the time scale of disc formation: these\ndata would suggest a qualitative growth law for the disc and could be com-\npared to our model results. Our model predicts either exponential or linear\ngrowth rates and it would be interesting to see if this matches experimental\nobservations. Also, estimates of the levels of Dpp and the rates of diffusion and\ngradient formation would allow for parametrisation of the model and further\nvalidation against the observed growth rates.\nSecondly, we also note that the system has been perturbed experimentally\nand that the results of these perturbations may be used to validate the model.\nOver expression of Dpp leads to increased wing growth, while clonal activation\nleads to increased proliferation in certain regions of the disc [21]: it would be\ninteresting to see if our model could be adapted to replicate these results and\nthis will be the subject of future work.\nA mechanism for morphogen-controlled domain growth 621\nThirdly, this work considers a very simplifiedmodel of amorphogen gradient:\nwithout endocytotic trafficking and with very simple forms for terms such as the\nrate ofDpp diffusion and the internalisation and subsequent decay ofDpp\u2013Tkv.\nThese choicesweremade in order to build a simple, initialmodelwhich captured\nthe essential behaviour of the system: more complex models for Dpp gradient\nformation and maintenance could of course be designed, but often creating\nsuch a complex initial model makes it difficult to elucidate key behaviour and\nproperties, in the manner in which we were able to do so in Sect. 5.\nWe should also mention that in this work we have concentrated on model-\nling a Dpp gradient which establishes very quickly (Telemann and co-workers\nsuggest that the rate of gradient formation is about four hours: see, for example,\n[23]), and where only small levels of flow result from the underlying growth.\nThis allowed us to make certain analytical approximations and also ensured\nthat we did not have problems with our numerical simulations: in mapping our\ngrowing domain in x to the fixed domain in \u0006, a fast growth rate results in our\neffective numerical mesh size quickly increasing and as a result our numerical\naccuracy decreasing.\nSome authors have suggested an alternate view for gradient formation: that\nin fact the rate of Dpp gradient formation is of the order of about two days; half\nthe time taken for growth of the wing disc [15]. They suggest that initially high\nlevels of unbound Tkv receptor prevent Dpp diffusion (resulting in a steep,\nshort range gradient), but that as Tkv expression is down-regulated a more\nshallow, long range gradient of Dpp forms. This could also be investigated using\nsimilar methods to those employed in Sect. 5 and it would be interesting to\nsee the resulting form of domain growth. We hope to present these results at a\nlater date.\nThe final question that we feel pertinent to this study is how growth of the\ndomain is regulated. In our model there is no mechanism for termination of\ngrowth. It could simply be that cells along the AP segment boundary simply\nstop expressing Dpp after a certain time, which would eventually dissolve the\nDpp gradient, but then we must ask what happens to growth via the brinker\npathway. These possibilities remain to be investigated.\nAcknowledgements REB would like to thank Lloyds Tercentenary Foundation for a Lloyds\nTercentenary Foundation Fellowship, Research Councils UK for an RCUK Academic Fellowship\nin Mathematical Biology, St Hugh\u2019s College, Oxford for a Junior Research Fellowship and Max\nPlanck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences for a visiting position.\nReferences\n1.
