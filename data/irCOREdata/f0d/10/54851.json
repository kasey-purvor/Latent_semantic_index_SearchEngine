A national performance improvement\nregistry will enable evaluation and sharing of effective\nimprovement methods as well as increasing stakeholder\nand public access to information on the quality of care\nprovided by ambulance services.\nINTRODUCTION\nClinical performance indicators are increasingly\nbeing used in healthcare to assess and improve\nservices, including in emergency1 and prehospital\nsettings.2 A performance indicator is an assessment\ntool used to monitor and evaluate important\ngovernance, management, clinical and support\nfunctions that affect patient outcomes.3 Healthcare\nquality is, \u2018the degree to which health services for\nindividuals and populations increase the likelihood\nof desired health outcomes and are consistent with\ncurrent professional knowledge\u2019.4\nClinical performance indicators for ambulance\nservices have previously focused primarily on\nemergency response times (8 and 19 min), which\nhave not been based on strong evidence,5 and as\na result may have led to poor morale, adverse\noutcomes for patients6 through slower access to\ndefinitive care7 as well as other opportunity costs.8\nThere are few validated clinical measures of effec-\ntiveness and quality in prehospital care that have\nbeen used nationally,9 partly due to the absence of\na clear and agreed process for their development. A\nrecent Delphi study of key informants has showed\nthat the development of new performance measures\nother than response times is the highest priority for\nprehospital research.10\nThere is, therefore, a compelling argument to\ndevelop clinical performance indicators for ambu-\nlance services in order to move from indicators\nbased primarily on response times and in light of\nchanging clinical demands on, and the trans-\nformation agenda of, ambulance services.11\nThere has been little work to date to develop\nmeaningful clinical performance indicators for\nambulance services. For indicators to be meaning-\nful, they should be measurable and realistic, aiming\nto address issues that matter to patients and clini-\ncians, to benchmark performance, to reduce varia-\ntions within and between health services and to\nbring about improvements in care for patients\nand users. Indicators should function as part of\na planned clinical quality improvement framework\nthat draws on modern improvement principles,\nmethods, tools and techniques; they should be\ndesigned to provide safe, effective, patient-centred,\ntimely, efficient and equitable healthcare. Impor-\ntantly, indicators should support clinicians and\nservices in providing better care to their patients\nand to deliver the aims of quality improvement.12\nClinical performance indicators are usually\nbased on rates measured in defined populations or\nsignificant (critical) incidents. Indicators can\nmeasure structures, processes or outcomes of health\ncare.13 Although process measures are more sensi-\ntive to the quality of care,14 intermediate outcomes\nthat are process measures that are known to have an\neffect on the true outcome, for example, aspirin or\nthrombolysis in acute myocardial infarction (AMI),\nare appropriate and often superior to simple\nprocess measures, for example, electrocardiographic\nrecording in AMI.\nWe aimed to develop, pilot and report on the\nprogress of the clinical indicators in order to utilise\nthem to facilitate the quality assessment and quality\nimprovement process for ambulance services.\nMETHOD\nThe development and pilot of indicators involved\nall English ambulance services and took place\n1East Midlands Ambulance\nService NHS Trust, Nottingham,\nUK 2Primary Care, University of\nLincoln, Lincoln, UK 3London\nAmbulance Service NHS Trust,\nLondon, UK 4South Western\nAmbulance Service NHS Trust,\nExeter, UK\nCorrespondence to\nProfessor A Niroshan\nSiriwardena, Faculty of Health,\nLife & Social Sciences, University\nof Lincoln, Brayford Pool, Lincoln\nLN6 7TS, UK;\nnsiriwardena@lincoln.ac.uk\nAccepted 8 July 2009\nEmerg Med J 2010;27:327e331. doi:10.1136\/emj.2009.072397 327\nPrehospital care\n group.bmj.com on April 12, 2010 - Published by emj.bmj.comDownloaded from \nbetween May 2007 and March 2008.

These were determined on the\nbasis of common conditions presenting to ambulance services\nand agreed through expert consensus by directors of clinical\ncare for ambulance services as having high impact (high inci-\ndence, admission to hospital or cost), potential for improved\noutcomes and amenable to comparative performance between\nservices.\nFurther development and refinement of specific indicators\ntook place through discussion at two meetings held in May and\nOctober 2007 by a subgroup of audit leads from ambulance\nservices leading to the construction of twenty clinical perfor-\nmance indicators. The measures were based on existing\nevidence-based guidance derived from consensus and primary\nevidence including the National Institute of Health and Clinical\nExcellence and the Joint Royal Colleges Ambulance Liaison\nCommittee.17 We based indicators on existing nomenclature,\nsuch as the Utstein template for cardiac arrest, where this was\navailable,18 and thus relied on well-established guidance rather\nthan new or emerging evidence. An example of the data collec-\ntion table, which details where trusts gathered the evidence is\nsummarised in table 1.\nThe process agreed for sampling was that each trust would\nsearch through their database of clinical records (electronically or\nmanually), estimating the number of cases of the clinical\ncondition per month and the total number of emergency cases\npresenting. The population denominator for each criterion was\nthe difference between number of cases reviewed in the audit\nand exceptions to the criterion. A pragmatic approach was\nagreed such that, while most trusts relied on manual systems,\nrandom sampling was preferred rather than attempting to\nprocess and analyse large datasets from trusts.\nA random sample of 300 records (or up to 300 if there were\nless than this) for the clinical condition was then examined for\neach performance indicator, agreed exclusions, time taken to\ncollect the data, whether this was electronic or manual (or both)\nand the person-hours required. Data were entered using specifi-\ncally designed templates. In order to assess the estimated total\nnumber of calls relating to each condition as a proportion of\nthe total calls received across the whole of each service, each\naudit requested an estimated number of cases per month and\nan estimated number of 999 or doctor urgent calls for the\nmonth.\nData were collected from each ambulance trust coordinated\nthrough East Midlands Ambulance Service NHS Trust. The data\nwere collated and tabulated using Excel and precision of results\nwere expressed as p6(1.963SE of p) where p\u00bcrate, n\u00bcnumber of\ncases in the sample, standard error (SE)\u00bcO(p(1\u0002p)\/n. Institu-\ntional performance was analysed and compared using funnel\nplots,19 which have the advantage of avoiding inappropriate\nranking but demonstrating outliers outside binomial control\nlimits calculated at three standard deviations (99.9%) above and\nbelow the mean.20\nRESULTS\nAll 11 English ambulance services participated in development of\nthe clinical performance indicators; 20 indicators in five domains\nwere selected (table 1). The indicators were based broadly on the\nconcept of review criteria that are \u2018systematically developed\nstatements to assess the appropriateness of specific healthcare\ndecisions, services and outcomes\u201921 in the clinical setting of calls\nto ambulance services attended by a paramedic or emergency\nmedical technician.\nAll services submitted data for the pilot evaluation. A prag-\nmatic approach was taken in the pilot around how services\ncollected data but information was presented on this with\nthe aim of making data collection more consistent in future.\nData were collected over a 1-month period for indicators in\neach domain and presented as tables (table 2) and control charts\n(figure 1) for 20 indicators in five domains.\nThe centre line on the control chart shows the mean of the\nunderlying data and the outer curved lines delineate the upper\nand lower control limits, which take into account the \u2018common\ncause\u2019 (natural) variation in the indicator being measured across\nservices as well as potential variation due to differences in\nnumbers of cases. The difference in samples sizes between\nservices was due to different caseloads and variation in the\nnumber of cases presenting in the month of data collection but\nthis was corrected for in the type of analysis used. The control\nlimits account for over 99.9% of the data and, therefore, perfor-\nmance for most trusts fall within these limits; where they do not\nthis indicates \u2018special cause variation\u2019 for which an explanation\nshould be looked for, such as differences in data quality or\norganisational systems affecting actual performance, so that\nrecommendations for improvement can be made.\nThe analysis of the pilot audit data received also revealed\na number of issues around case definition and data collection;\nsome were general (Box 1) while others related to specific criteria.\nDISCUSSION\nThis is the first published account of the development and\ntesting of nationally agreed clinical performance indicators for\nambulance services. The project involved all ambulance services\nand was supported by chief executives, directors of clinical care\nand audit leads of English ambulance services. Twenty indicators\nwere developed and piloted in five clinical domains using\na systematic but pragmatic approach. Performance was\nmeasured in systematic samples of cases taken over a month for\neach domain. Comparative performance was benchmarked using\ncontrol charts.\nThe strength of this project was the full participation of all\nservices in development and testing of the indicators. The\nHealthcare Commission included submission to the pilot as part\nof the new standards for care in 2007\/2008.22 Several problems\nwere identified with the definition of criteria, exceptions and data\ncollection processes but these were recognised and corrected,\nwhich was part of the purpose of the pilot.\nTable 2 Performance for administration of aspirin to patients with\nsuspected ST elevation myocardial infarction\nAmbulance\nservice\nSample\ndenominator Proportion\nUpper\n95% CI\nLower\n95% CI\n1 11 90.91% 107.90% 73.92%\n2 112 64.29% 73.16% 55.41%\n3 221 79.19% 84.54% 73.83%\n4 121 99.17% 100.79% 97.56%\n5* 50 76.00% 87.84% 64.16%\n6 176 84.09% 89.49% 78.69%\n7 300 49.00% 54.66% 43.34%\n8 74 87.84% 95.28% 80.39%\n9 155 87.10% 92.37% 81.82%\n10 102 77.45% 85.56% 69.34%\n11 61 90.16% 97.64% 82.69%\n*Data for five STEMI Audit taken from Jan 2007 as July data unavailable.\nEmerg Med J 2010;27:327e331. doi:10.1136\/emj.2009.072397 329\nPrehospital care\n group.bmj.com on April 12, 2010 - Published by emj.bmj.comDownloaded from \nOther models have been developed for emergency medical\nsystem indicators23 but they have not, to our knowledge, covered\na range of clinical conditions or been piloted or tested on\na national scale as these have been. The indicators were chosen to\nevaluate the performance of paramedics or emergency techni-\ncians in the clinical setting of an ambulance service response to\nan emergency call. The development of the clinical indicators has\nbeen based on a philosophy of accountability and quality\nimprovementd in line with similar developments in other\nhealth sectors in the UK and internationally.24 The indicators\ncontinue to be developed and refined and a second phase of\ndevelopment will include important areas such as trauma.25\nThe validity and usefulness of the indicators will ultimately\nbe determined by stakeholder perceptions of value, action taken\nby trusts to implement changes in care and the impact of such\nchange in terms of improvements in quality of care. As part of\nthis process, ambulance trusts have agreed to identify clinical\nareas for improvement, informed by comparative plots (showing\ninstitutional variation in performance across services) indicating\nclinical areas where they appear to be outliers in performance,\nconsidered together with professional and patient priorities for\nimprovement. Ambulance services will have an opportunity to\nset agreed national targets as well as specific improvement\ntargets for themselves for their chosen clinical area.\nQuality improvement, rather than focusing simply on head-\nline indicators, will need to fundamentally consider how to\nimprove processes and pathways of care within the clinical areas\nselected for improvement, focussing on the system of care rather\nthan individual components. This will involve leadership and\na move to a quality culture involving front-line staff in\nimproving care based on implementing evidence and testing this\nusing \u2018plan-do-study-act\u2019 cycles, process mapping, reminders,\nfeedback and other evidence-based methods.26\nIn order to increase availability of information to services and\neventually the general public, a National Ambulance Clinical\nPerformance Indicator Registry is being developed to support\nquality improvement using a web-based technology platform.\nIt is envisaged that the registrywill enable further development\nof clinical indicators, benchmarking of performance, identifica-\ntion and implementation of specific evidence-based interventions\nto improve care in areas identified for improvement, and evalua-\ntion and sharing of effective improvement methods as well as\nincreasing stakeholder and public access to information on the\nquality of care provided by ambulance services.\nIn future, electronic clinical records will enable harmonisation\nof datasets and data collection to support collection of data for\nnational as well as local clinical quality improvement. The\nchosen clinical indicators will be measured more frequently,\nFigure 1 Control chart showing performance for\nadministration of aspirin to patients with suspected ST\nelevation myocardial infarction.\nSTEMI: M1 Aspirin\n11\n10\n98\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0.0%\n10.0%\n20.0%\n30.0%\n40.0%\n50.0%\n60.0%\n70.0%\n80.0%\n90.0%\n100.0%\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450\nSample denominator\nn\no\ni\nt\nr\no\np\no\nr\nP\nIdentifiers\nMean\nUCL\nLCL\nBox 1 General comments based on feedback from pilot\n< Inclusion and exclusion criteria need to be explicit so as not to\nlend themselves to misinterpretation.\n< Criteria should be reviewed in light of comments raised during\nthe pilot.\n< Exclusion criteria for each audit need clarification to ensure\nthat they are explicit and include omissions highlighted during\npilot.\n< Additional exclusion criteria should be submitted to the\nnational group and agreed or rejected so that all services are\ncollecting the same information.\n< Where audits are carried out electronically some manual\nverification of data may be needed; for example, where\ninformation is recorded in free text areas of patient clinical\nrecords.\n< Sampling strategies need to be agreed and consistent so that\ndata collection processes and data quality are comparable.\n< Sample sizes should be reviewed for each audit in light of\ninformation from the pilot.\n< Although SPC charts are not as dependent on equivalent\nquantities of data being submitted as other benchmarking\nmethods, large variations in the data supplied will affect control\nlimits. As far as possible, trusts should endeavour to supply the\namount of data requested in the sample size, rather than fewer\nor more, so that comparisons are, as far as possible, like for\nlike. The sample sizes for each audit may need amending in the\nlight of the information gathered during the pilot.\n< It is recognised that difficulties in gathering data may have\nbeen due to the pilots being introduced at fairly short notice\nand after audit plans had been drawn up. It is assumed that this\nwill ease in the future as CPIs are integrated into audit plans\nand additional resources are provided for this work. Where\ntrusts are having difficulty in accessing data within the relevant\ntimescales it would be useful if any solutions they came up\nwith were shared across the organisations. This will be easier\nonce the online tools and website have been developed.\n330 Emerg Med J 2010;27:327e331. doi:10.1136\/emj.2009.072397\nPrehospital care\n group.bmj.com on April 12, 2010 - Published by emj.bmj.comDownloaded from \ncharted and fed back to services using statistical process control\nmethods to show change over time in processes or outcomes of\ncare. Electronic clinical records also provide the possibility of\nreducing institutional barriers and improving continuity of care\nacross different sectors of healthcare services as well as gathering\ndata on true outcomes of care as primary care, hospital and\nambulance services are able to share clinical information.27\nThis initiative offers the potential for ambulance services to\nidentify clinical areas for improvement, to set clear aims and\ntargets appropriate for their own organisation and to implement\nevidence-based methods for improvement. This should include\nfront-line staff, managers and directors involving a system-wide\nand whole-service approach giving services the potential to\ndemonstrate significant and enduring increases in the quality of\ncare they provide to patients.\nAcknowledgements We would like to acknowledge the support of the Clinical\nPerformance Indicator Subgroup of the National Ambulance Clinical Audit Steering\nGroup, which included the following members: John Appleby-Fleming, Sarah Black,\nRachael Donohoe, Jenny Lumley-Holmes, Steve Mortley, Mary Peters, Deborah\nShaw, Anne Spaight and Niroshan Siriwardena.\nContributors ANS, JS and DS were involved in the initial concept and design of the\nquality improvement initiative.
