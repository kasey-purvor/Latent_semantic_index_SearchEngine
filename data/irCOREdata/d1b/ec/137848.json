The NIC aims \nto provide a comprehensive data framework for the natural resource management \nresponsibilities of the Directorate as a whole and will serve to underpin the European \nsoils-related requirements (King et al., 1998), subsequent to the proposed accession of \nTurkey to the European Union. An initial case-study project and feasibility study by the \nNIC and the UK National Soil Resources Institute (NSRI) covering the Ankara region has \nbeen followed by a programme to capture and store the first fully digital soil map of \nTurkey. Other sources of relevant information from similar resource information agencies \nat national and international levels have also been considered for inclusion within the \nsystem. The NIC will serve the commitments of GDRS to the development of the Turkish \nrural economy through the integration of soil and irrigation services, the planning of rural \nroads, potable water and power supplies, as well as land settlement planning. \n \nGDRS and the Turkish Rural Economy \n \nThe GDRS of today is founded upon three previous government Directorates; \nTOPRAKSU (General Directorate of Soil and Irrigation Works), YSE (General \nDirectorate of Rural Road, Potable Water and Electricity Affairs) and TOPRAK ISKAN \n(General Directorate for Land and Settlement). These areas, now managed by the unified \nGDRS, deliver rural and agricultural services and social infrastructure to 76,457 villages \nand settlements in Turkey. This infrastructure includes the provision of drinking water, \nrural road construction, settlement of rural communities and agricultural extension \nactivities. GDRS is committed to \u2018contribute to the cost-effective and sustainable \nagricultural use of the land and water resources of Turkey, by the conduct of focussed \nresearch activities of international quality\u2019 (KHGM, 1999a). This remit calls for the \nestablishment and maintenance of the balance between the demands of rural socio-\neconomic development and the need to support and sustain a fragile arid and semi-arid \nenvironmental resource. In the coming decades, this resource will be under increasing \npressure and there are significant challenges faced in advancing this plan. By example, \nincreasingly technologically based food production practices and poor management has \ncontributed to problems ranging from wind and water erosion (Ozden and Sonmez, 1998; \nTaysun et al., 1998), waterlogging, sodicity and salination of the soil resource (Cullu et \nal., 1998).  GDRS operates within a legislative framework which enforces the importance \nof its environmental management responsibilities, relating specifically to: \n \n(1) stopping erosion in areas suitable for agriculture, preventing damage from flood \nwaters, preserving water in the soil and maintaining productivity, \n(2) rendering suitable for agriculture, lands in private or state tenure that are degraded \nbecause of acidity, salinity or sodicity, \n(3) providing services for irrigated agriculture, including land-levelling, on-farm \nirrigation and drainage, \n(4) constructing irrigation supply headworks for schemes requiring less than 500 ls-1 \n(5) classifying soils, carrying out analyses and producing information in regard to \nproductivity, irrigation, drainage, land clearing, improvement, consolidation and use \ncapability, \n(6) undertaking research in relation to all of the above (KHGM, 1995). \n \nTraditionally, the Turkish national economy has been heavily dependent upon \nagriculture. Almost half the population of Turkey live in rural areas and work in the \nagricultural sector. From a total land area of 77.8 million hectares, Turkey has some 27.7 \nmillion hectares under arable farming. Within this, some 4 million hectares has been \ndeveloped for irrigated production. Out of the further total stock of 8.5 million hectares of \nland considered to be capable of economic agricultural development, Turkey plans to \nincrease the irrigated land area by 1.62 million hectares by the year 2001, supported by \nthe necessary investments in infrastructure (KHGM, 1995). As the Turkish economy has \ndeveloped, so the ongoing importance of the role played by the rural agricultural sector \nhas become more apparent. Turkey\u2019s overall social and economic prosperity still heavily \ndepends upon the interplay of population, agricultural production and rural environment. \nConsequently, rural areas are in need of significant investment to underpin the \ndevelopment of sustainable agricultural production, social infrastructure and education.  \nThe rural development services provided by GDRS aim to raise the general \nstandard of living, and the Directorate has the responsibility for establishing the \ninfrastructure to achieve this. In Turkey, quality agricultural land is a valuable but limited \nresource. It has been estimated that 1.5 million hectares of the Turkish arable land \nresource suffers from production limitations due to the effects of salinity, with a further \n2.8 million hectares suffering from waterlogging. The condition of much of the available \narable land has deteriorated over recent decades due to water and wind erosion. Some \n63% of the total erosion recorded is categorised as severe or very severe, with 20% \nhaving moderate and 14% slight or negligible erosion (KHGM, 1987). Great importance \nis attached to increasing and sustaining agricultural production and in promoting the \nimportance of soil and water research in Turkey (KHGM, 1995). To achieve the greatest \nbenefit from the agricultural market, GDRS continually reviews and expands the use of \ncontemporary technological and scientific advances. The role offered by information \ntechnology is recognised as being of profound importance in the sustainable management \nof natural resources (M.G\u0171ner Saygili, GDRS Director General, Pers. Comm.), and this \ntenet has underpinned the establishment of the NIC. \n \nThe remit of the National Information Centre \n \nPrior to the creation of the NIC, there was no single centralised point of contact in GDRS \nfor key geographical and related information used in its operational and research \nactivities. Geographical Information System (GIS) developments are not new to GDRS as \nprototype research-oriented land information systems have been established in the GDRS \nSoil and Fertiliser Research Institute (SFRI) and the research institutes of Eski\u015fehir and \nErzurum. However, in general, research and management planning information has been \nproduced and stored principally in non-digital form; each Regional and Provincial office \ncollecting and holding the information it required for day-to-day activities, with little co-\nordination. Historically, the result has been poor information management and much \nduplication of resources. Furthermore, paper-based maps produced indicating locations of \nentities such as rural road features and potable water supply equipment have not been \nkept fully updated, with no formal central mechanism to service this requirement. The \nNIC was established to provide a managed system and a central repository for the core \ninformation resource of GDRS. To achieve this, the Centre was tasked with providing the \nability to collect, integrate and analyse digital data deriving from a variety of different \nsources from within and outside GDRS, in satisfying its operational and research \nrequirements. The ultimate intention is to extend the information and any related \napplications of the NIC to all the national offices of GDRS, providing its managers with \nan effective and easy access to the centralised resource. In drawing together the data \nresources required, and being advised by the UK National Soil Resources Institute \n(NSRI), the NIC has embarked upon the construction of the first Turkish national soil \nmap in digital form. This work will constitute the initial focus for the activities of the \nCentre. \nFormed in Ankara in the late 1990s with initial sponsorship through the World Bank \nTurkish Agricultural Research Project (TARP) project (KHGM, 1995), the NIC was \ntasked with addressing the following core functions in developing the rural economy \n(after KHGM, 1999b): \n \n1. To collect and organise both point and spatial data on Turkish natural resources and \nenvironment; \n2. To develop a computerised Information System to store, manipulate and maintain \nsuch data; \n3. To provide a centralised resource for GDRS staff, reducing duplication of effort; \n4. To act as a repository for publications containing rural environmental information on \nTurkey; \n5. To increase awareness of other organisations collecting and disseminating rural \nenvironmental data in Turkey; \n6. To use Geographical Information System and Remote Sensing techniques in the \nanalysis and planning of natural resources, the adoption of which will greatly speed \nresearchers, users and decision-makers in their work; \n7. By using the national database, preparations can be made for solving problems related \nto the usage of natural resources and their management. New data can be provided, \nthe differences can be monitored and brought up to date; \n8. To facilitate and encourage the exchange of ideas among resource information \nagencies at national and international levels. \n \nEstablishing an enterprise such as the NIC, calls for the adoption of flexible data \nmanagement structures. Although focussing upon soil and water resource management in \nGDRS, the system is also intended to incorporate data sources from a number of other \nGovernment Directorates. Furthermore, the data holdings of the NIC are to be made \navailable to other Government Directorates. When this occurs every effort will be made \nfor such interchanges to occur directly over the Internet, and to subscribe to emergent \nspatial interoperability standards such as those of the OpenGIS Consortium\u2019s \u2018Open \nGeospatial Datastore Interface (OGDI) (SAI, 1998; Rigaux et al., 2002). Whilst it \nappears unlikely that a comprehensive government-wide information system will be \nestablished in Turkey in the immediate future, the approaches adopted by the NIC will \nfacilitate co-operative practices with other Government initiatives using the same sources \nand types of information. There does exist the long-term intention to develop a Turkish \nNational GIS office, and if this occurs the approaches of the NIC should prove directly \ntransferable. In the UK the phrases \u2018joined-up government\u2019 and \u2018joined-up geography\u2019 \nhave emerged to describe the phenomenon of co-operative inter-Departmental sharing of \ninformation and knowledge. For natural resource management, such data frameworks \nwill include thematic sources including soils, geology, watercourses, topography and \nother natural features. Allied to this are other data frameworks including political and \ncadastral boundaries, geo-demographics and street mapping. \nWithin GDRS, it is planned that the NIC should serve all elements of the \nDirectorate\u2019s activities and responsibilities (Fig. 1). In addition to the operational \nresponsibilities of GDRS, there are also strong research and development activities. Here \nthe NIC will contribute particularly to the fields of agronomy and soil management and \nconservation. \n \nSoil and Water\nResources\nNational\nInformation\nCentre\nGen\neral D\nirectorate of Rural Services\nThe Turkish NationalGeographic Information Syste\nm\nHeadquarters\nRe\ngi\non\nal \nDir\nec\ntora\ntes\nCo\nmp\nute\nr C\nen\ntre\nResearch Institutes\nProvincial Directorates\n \n \nFigure 1.  The components of GDRS to be serviced by the NIC  \nSource: NIC Management Team \n \nAs the Centre develops, there will clearly be many opportunities for the data holdings of \nthe NIC to feed directly into the work undertaken by GDRS at its Ankara headquarters \nsite, its 11 research facilities and in its outlying regional and provincial offices. Three \nobvious areas for application of the NIC within GDRS are as follows. \n \n1. Planning and operational activities through the timely provision of quality \ninformation. Examples including catchment rehabilitation, soil conservation, \nirrigation and drainage and land consolidation; \n2. Provision of data resources for the research programmes. Examples including soil \nerosion modelling in sensitive catchments; \n3. The spatial representation of the inventory asset data resource required for investment \nmanagement research. Examples being geo-locations of major inventory assets. \n \nIn basing such functions upon the underpinning information system foundation, the NIC \nwill follow other established European soil and land information systems such as the \nLandIS system of the UK National Soil Resources Institute (Dufour et al., 1998; Hallett \net al., 1996). \n \nBuilding the information system \n \nOne of the important organisational concepts behind the NIC has been the development \nof comprehensive in-house staff expertise in GIS and data management. To create such a \ncentre of excellence NIC staff have assumed the on-going responsibility for all aspects of \nthe Centre\u2019s work. The outsourcing of significant data capture, conversion and \nmanagement tasks was considered as an option, but importantly was not chosen, thereby \nallowing the in-house skills-base to develop. Having a broad flexible base of technical \ncompetence within the Centre was seen as benefiting the meeting of future demands. The \nprincipal operational activities for the NIC team in the initial phases of the Centre are \nshown in Fig. 2. The work is split between \u2018internally-facing\u2019 resource management \nactivities, and \u2018externally-facing\u2019 application development activities. Project management \nactivities span both sets of activities. A sequence is implied in the resource management \nactivity, commencing with systems administration tasks. Great importance was placed in \nthe user liaison role. The overall system was designed to replace a number of manual \nprocedures and to centralise information management. In this case it was fairly \nstraightforward to identify and replicate processes. However, in meeting further \noperational and research requirements a good deal of user education will be required to \ndraw the system capabilities to the attention of users who may not have had prior \nexperience of information systems.   \n \nProject Management\nApplication Development\nUser Liasion Teams\nHelp Desk Teams\nDeveloper Solution  Teams\nResource Management\nInterface\nDevelopment\nSystems\nAdministration\nDatabase\nAdministration\nSystems\nAnalysis\nDatabase\nLoading\nData\nCapture\nData\nProcurement\nQuality\nControl\n \n \nFigure 2.  Principal NIC activities and services \nSource: NIC Management Team \n \nAmong the core information technologies to be implemented initially in the NIC will be \nGeographical Information Systems (GIS) together with database management systems \n(DBMS) and in due course Remote Sensing (RS). Together, these will permit the \nconstruction of toolkits aimed specifically at supporting decision-making or management \nrelationship techniques, as well as providing information about a lot of different \ngeographical structures, and analysis and usage of resources. Adopting such an approach \nwill bring a number of advantages, providing a useful facility for users, offering effective \nmeans for data input, storage, analysis and presentation. The GIS will be used as a \u2018data-\nmixer\u2019 to create an integrated view of the variety of databases and data themes employed \nin the information system, spanning levels of map content, scale, detail and usage. The \nGIS will be further used to \u2018spatialise\u2019 existing data, and to provide access to the data \nresource through data mining and analysis techniques. The GIS will also play a role in \npresenting the information required to explain environmental policies and the impacts of \ndecision making to an increasingly well-informed and participatory public. In this way, \nGIS offers a powerful tool for visualisation and presentation of the information resource. \nA range of GIS software was evaluated for the purposes of the overall project; a \nfactor in this was prior GIS software adoption elsewhere in GDRS. There were \ncomponents within GDRS already possessing GIS expertise, notably the research \ninstitutes. The final choice of software was the \u2018TNTmips\u2019 package from the NPA Group \n(NPA, 2001), see Fig. 3. Although new software for GDRS, the choice was made for \nseveral reasons including; cost-performance, the level of local support offered, \nintegration with existing Oracle-based database management systems, its ability to serve \ninformation via the Internet to Regional offices and importantly its strong support for the \nTurkish language in GIS interface design. \n \n \nFigure 3.  Digitising the Turkish national soil map \nSource: NIC \n \nThe information system data holdings \n \nThe Soil and Water Information System was designed to include datasets using a \ncommon reference base derived from the 1:25,000 topographic mapping of the General \nCommand of Mapping using the Universal Transverse Mercator projection. The principal \ndatasets required are identified in Table 1. The relationships between the datasets are \nidentified in Fig. 4, as well as their sources where external to GDRS. \n \nTable 1.

Principle NIC data sources and inputs  \nSource: NIC Management Team \n \nThe Turkish National Soil Map \n \nIn Turkey the first real attempt at soil survey and mapping began in 1952 with the help of \nthe United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (UN FAO). This resulted in the \npublication in 1954 of the 1:800,000 \u2018Turkey General Soil Map\u2019 and associated report, \nwith geological and topographical maps being used to develop a reconnaissance-level \nstudy. \nSubsequently, a Turkish soil classification was created.  Between 1966 and 1971 \nthe General Directorate of Soil and Water (now a part of GDRS) produced a series of soil \nmaps including the \u2018Turkey Development Soil Map (TDSM)\u2019, using a 1:25,000 scale \ntopographical basemap. However, the number of observations was more appropriate to a \nreconnaissance level map. In this survey, map units were described according to the 1938 \nAmerican Soil Classification System based on soil groups and including soil and land \nfeatures such as depth, slope, stoniness and erosion risk to delineate phases.   \nThis was the first original land study that mapped nation-wide knowledge and at \nthe same time highlighted the important problems of soils and their distribution.  Today \nthis study remains the main resource that can be applied to the problems and uses of \nTurkey\u2019s soils.  Two subsequent maps were produced after evaluating the data. Firstly, a \n\u2018Soil Resource Inventory Map\u2019 was published for every province at a scale of 1:100,000. \nSecondly, a \u2018Watershed Soil Map and Report\u2019 was produced showing 17 of Turkey's 26 \nmajor watersheds or catchments, at a scale of 1:200,000.  \nBetween 1982 and 1984, the General Directorate of Soil and Water phased out the \n\u2018Turkey Soils Potential Survey\u2019 and the \u2018Non Agriculture Aims Land Usage Planning \nProject\u2019, replacing them with the \u2018Turkey Development Soil Map Surveys\u2019. These former \nreports identified differences in soil depth, stoniness, erosion levels and distributions in \nall of the Great Soil Groups supported by data obtained from field trips. In addition, \ndifferences in drainage, salinity and alkalinity, land use and land feasibility classes were \nmade, bringing the maps up to date by incorporating observations made at 1:25,000 scale \nfrom field studies. \nFrom 1987 onwards, maps were prepared from the results of the \u2018Turkey \nDevelopment Soil Maps Surveys\u2019 at a scale of 1:100,000. After consultation with GDRS \nand the survey groups, a \u2018Turkey Soil Zones Map\u2019 was prepared at the scale of \n1:2,000,000.  This was ultimately published as the \u2018Turkey General Soil Management \nPlan\u2019. \nAn immediate task facing the NIC team has been to begin the systematic capture \nand integration of the paper-based national soil map into the information system. The \n1:25,000 soil maps of Turkey are presently being digitised.  The principal sources of this \nkey national dataset are pencil tracings and annotations on transparent material.  \nAlthough unsatisfactory as a medium for data capture, it remains the only source of \ndetailed information available. The soil map legend represents a wide range of \nenvironmental parameters, as each unit was labelled with a compound alphanumeric \nsymbol giving information on various soil and site attributes. There are over 5564 \n1:25,000 scale soil maps covering the whole of Turkey and to create a national database \nfrom these data is a task requiring significant resources (KHGM, 1999b). \n \nAdministrative and Cadastral Boundaries \n \nThe authoritative source of the provincial and district boundaries of Turkey is the General \nDirectorate of Land Registration and Cadastral Survey (Bohme, 1993). The work of this \nDirectorate is closely allied with that of the General Command of Mapping, overlaying \ncadastral features onto the standard topographical base-maps. Where practicable, it is \nintended that this data will be incorporated digitally as a spatial layer in the GDRS soil \nand water information system.  \n \nGeology \n \nGeological mapping is the responsibility of the Mineral Research and Exploration \nDepartment (MTA). A 1:25,000 geology map digitisation programme was undertaken by \nMTA in 1996 and is nearing completion. The means of capturing improved datasets are \nconstantly sought. More contemporary studies by MTA have investigated novel \ntechniques for identifying active faults in the rift valleys of western Turkey using digital \nterrain data (Akman et al., 2001). \n \nClimate \n \nHistoric climate data is held in publications of meteorological station data produced by \nthe State Meteorological Service (SMS). These documents contain daily, monthly and \nannual summaries for approximately 400 meteorological stations in Turkey. These data \nare not currently held in a digitised form and will need to be entered either by hand or \nusing raster-scanning technology. SMS have, however, provided useful datasets for \nrecent meteorological research in degree-day modelling (B\u00fcy\u00fckalaca et al., 2001), and \nsuch accumulated temperature data could be utilised as the basis for crop-suitability \nmodelling applications (Hallett and Jones, 1993). \n \nTopographical Base-Mapping \n \nTopographic datasets for Turkey are the responsibility of the General Command of \nMapping (GCM), part of the Turkish Ministry of Defence. The General Command of \nMapping has completed a series of 5,564 1:25,000 scale topographic maps for the whole \nof Turkey (Bohme, 1993). This basic scale mapping is prepared to conform to the \nUniversal Transverse Mercator (UTM) grid with 6o bands, using the Hayford \nInternational 1909 Ellipsoid. Each of the map sheets displays an area of 7\u2019 30\u201d latitude by \n7\u2019 30\u2019\u2019 longitude and is prepared on a five-colour base with contour data being included \nat 10-metre contour intervals. The Unit has also completed a 72 map series at 1:250,000 \nscale. Each of the map sheets displays an area of 1o 30\u2019 longitude by 1o latitude and \nincludes contours at 100-metre intervals with supplementary at 50 and 25 metres. On \nthese latter map sheets, relief is represented through hill-shading techniques and also \ncontour data. The General Command of Mapping is also creating digital 10-metre \ncontours from the 1:25,000 scaled maps; it has completed digital 100, 50 and 25 metre \ncontours from the 1:250,000 scaled maps for the whole of Turkey. As the data become \navailable, they will form a keystone for the NIC database resource. The General \nCommand of Mapping also maintains an archive of aerial photographs. These \nphotographs are mostly black and white and could, in most instances, be considered as \nthe basis for other mapping purposes. \n \nInventory, Census and Small-Scale Hydrology \n \nGDRS is responsible for mapping and recording inventory, census and small-scale \nhydrological features (operating at <500 l\/s). This information is captured and managed \nin a purpose-built Inventory information system. It is envisaged that it will be necessary \nfor the NIC system to interact with the Inventory system, providing access to spatial \nreferencing for its features (Table 3). \n \nTable 3.

Soil conservation and new settlements \n \nThe Inventory also holds population data for the villages derived from the State Institute \nof Statistics (SIS), and having recently become operational, these data are now being \nloaded. This process was completed in 2000. The geographic distribution of the data will \nbe derived from the village location points. District and provincial town centre locations \nwill not be available from this source as they tend to cover larger areas and a single grid \nreference is considered to offer impracticable referencing. \n \nLarge-Scale Hydrology \n \nIn Turkey, large-scale hydrological features (>500 l\/s) are the responsibility of the State \nHydraulic Works (SHW). This department publishes reports on the rain flow and lake \nlevels on a sub-catchment basis for the 26 major catchments in Turkey. It is planned to \nstore digitised maps of the catchment and sub-catchment boundaries as a GIS layer within \nthe NIC information system to enable the display of rain flow and associated data. Each \ncatchment and sub-catchment would be given a SHW number and name as an attribute. \nSimilarly a lake GIS layer could be digitised and linked with the lake level data. These \nobservations would be held within the database system. The catchment, sub-catchment \nand lake numbers would be used to link the spatial areas to the observation data. \n \nDevelopments of the information system \n \nThe initial deployment of the NIC has been undertaken jointly between the GDRS \nResearch, Planning and Co-ordination Department and the GDRS Computer Centre. The \nintention from the outset was to establish an infrastructure that would propagate its data \nand services to the outlying \u2018clients\u2019 from a central service (Fig. 1). A number of \nmechanisms for delivering content were envisaged according to the requirements and the \nrecipients. This would range from the distribution of complete datasets, to on-demand \nmapping and analysis based on secure wide area network, or Internet World Wide Web \naccess. \nThe greatest challenge for GDRS in managing agricultural land resources will \ncome from salinity, waterlogging and erosion. Any comprehensive and sustainable rural \npolicy must accommodate measures designed to ameliorate or reduce these factors. Yet, \nas the pace of development and the demands on the rural economy increase, the balance \nis harder to maintain. Furthermore, the strain placed upon GDRS resources by the recent \nearthquake disasters has made the process of allocating resources and identifying \npriorities even more difficult. \nThe Soil and Water National Information System offers GDRS an effective and \ncost-efficient management tool to meet its many and varied responsibilities. Although \nstill in its early days, the NIC has already drawn together many of the key thematic \ndatasets which underpin such decision-making, with considerable effort being made in \nidentifying the most appropriate distribution mechanisms for the resulting information. \nThe Centre has also commenced with great efficiency the compilation of the first national \nsoil map in digital form. This will be of great importance in the direction of the rural \neconomy, especially given Turkey\u2019s proposed accession to the European Union and the \nsubsequent compliance required for its environmental Directives. The European \nCommission has a strong requirement for Europe wide information on soils to assist in \nthe formulation of policies addressing topics such as freshwater and groundwater \nmanagement policies, improved agricultural production, environmental protection and \ncountering the threats of soil erosion and agricultural pollution (Burrill, 1996). \nThere are plans underway to enhance and improve the basic soil mapping \nresource in Turkey. It is anticipated that a national programme of detailed surveys may \nsoon be commenced to determine factors including soil type, land use, land capability and \nfertility levels with greater precision and accuracy than before. In recognition of the \nlimitations of the current soil mapping, which lacks fully comprehensive geo-located \nprofile observations to validate the map separates, GDRS is planning two specific \nprojects. Firstly, a revised version of the 1:1,000,000 scale soil map will be compiled, \nwhich will retain the original soil lines but will re-allocate the map units according to the \nFAO\/Soil Map of Europe classification with a soil interpreted report (KHGM, 1999c). \nThis development would allow for a variety of interpretations to be made consistent with \nresearch elsewhere in Europe (Van Ranst et al., 1995). Secondly it is proposed that a new \nland cover and land use map be compiled using modern technology and including \nclassified remotely sensed imagery. \n This reappraisal of the soil mapping will feed directly into the planning \nrequirements for catchment rehabilitation, soil conservation, irrigation and drainage and \nland consolidation projects. Also, soil and water analyses are conducted to determine the \nfactors most limiting to agricultural yield and productivity, with farmers being provided \nwith technical recommendations as to the appropriate use of fertilisers and other \nagrochemicals, together with suitable crop rotation patterns. In these cases, it is \nimperative that the NIC data framework be in place to handle and manipulate these new \ndatasets. However, at this time, the financial constraints under which the NIC will operate \nin the future are not yet fully defined. Indications are that the importance of the NIC is \nfully recognised at the highest levels within GDRS and means are being sought to \nprovide appropriate ongoing financial support. \n Future assessments will be required to identify and review the impacts the \ninformation system has upon the management and research of the key environmental \nproblems identified. These will feedback into ongoing developments for the information \nsystem, supporting its value as an effective tool for GDRS. \n \nSummary \n \nThe infrastructure has now been established for the development of the GDRS Soil and \nWater NIC. This resource will be highly valuable to GDRS supporting its responsibility \ntowards the effective and sustainable ongoing management of the Turkish rural economy. \nThe NIC will provide a cost-effective national centre of excellence in land information \nsystems design and implementation, and its work will underpin a large part of the \noperational aspects, as well as the research activities undertaken in GDRS. For Turkey to \ngain the fullest benefit from this investment, it is important that the work of the NIC be \nmade available in digital form to associated government directorates and agencies, such \nas the Ministry of Agriculture, the South-Eastern Anatolia Project (GAP) project offices, \nthe State Hydraulic Works and the State Meteorological Service. \nThe initial steps are now underway to create the full infrastructure required to \nadminister the national Soil and Water Information System, as well as the data resources \nthat it will hold. An important task for the NIC is to retain and develop staff experienced \nin the use of GIS and database management, maintaining the impetus of the project and \nits developments. Operationally, this is made particularly difficult given the IT skills-\nshortage in Turkey. There are many challenges to be faced in the next decades as GDRS \nand associated government agencies and directorates address environmental threats \nincluding wind and water erosion, waterlogging, sodicity and salination of the soil \nresource. However, the tools that the NIC will offer will be an invaluable aid in natural \nresource and rural management and, importantly, would contribute further to the national \ninformation infrastructure following Turkey\u2019s proposed accession to the European Union. \n \nReferences \n \nAkman, A.U., Sanga, T., Narui, E. & Oikawa, N.
