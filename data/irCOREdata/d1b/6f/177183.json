Secondary outcomes were operative differences, \nacceptability of treatment and changes in health related quality of life. \n \nResults: - Both technologies achieved high levels of satisfaction (-1%, 95% CI \n(-11, 9)). Menstrual scores were also similar (4%, 95% CI (-7, 19)) Microwave \nhad a significantly shorter operating time, reduced usage of antiemetics and \nopiate analgesia, increased discharge by six hours and fewer device failures.  \n \n - 5 - \nConclusions  \nBoth treatments are acceptable to women, with high levels of satisfaction. \nMicrowave is quicker to perform with faster hospital discharge . \nKey words \nMenorrhagia, randomised trial, surgical treatments \nTrial registered online at:  \nhttp:\/\/www.controlled-trials.com\/ISRCTN28184453 \n \n - 6 - \nClinical outcomes of Microwave Endometrial Ablation v Thermal Balloon \nEndometrial Ablation \u2013 a randomised comparison. \n \nIntroduction \nThe surgical treatment of heavy menstrual loss has been revolutionised over \nthe last fifteen years with the widespread introduction of endometrial ablation. \nFirst generation hysteroscopic endometrial ablative techniques (transcervical \nresection of the endometrium (TCRE), rollerball and laser) are successful but \nrequire high levels of skill.1-5 This led to the development of second generation \ntechniques which are technically much simpler to perform, but the majority of \nwhich are not performed under direct hysteroscopic vision.1-5 There is a \nwealth of robust evidence comparing first generation endometrial ablation \ntechniques to hysterectomy1-5 whilst second generation techniques have been \ncompared with first generation techniques, in order to prove their efficacy.6-15 \nGood quality randomised trials comparing clinical outcomes and costs \nbetween the different varieties of second generation ablative techniques are \nless common.16-18 We aimed to rectify this with a comparison of the two \nsecond generation techniques most commonly used in the UK, microwave \nendometrial ablation (MEATM) and thermal balloon endometrial ablation \n(TBall). This is in accordance with a recommendation from the National \ninstitute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE).19  \n \nMethods \nParticipants \n - 7 - \nWomen complaining of heavy menstrual loss and requesting endometrial \nablation were recruited by a research fellow from the gynaecology department \nof Aberdeen Royal Infirmary in the UK during the period January 2003 to \nJanuary 2005. Patients were eligible if they were pre-menopausal, had \ncompleted their families, and had a uterine size equivalent to a twelve week \npregnancy or less with no histopathological abnormalities of the endometrium \nand no fibroids obstructing the uterine cavity. Women with lower segment \ncaesarean scars were included if their scar thickness was greater than 10mm \non transvaginal ultrasound. All women gave informed consent to participate in \nthe trial. The patients did not routinely undergo hysteroscopy prior to \nrecruitment, unless transvaginal ultrasound scan suggested an abnormal \nuterine cavity. \n \nInterventions \nProcedures were undertaken in the post menstrual phase. This was either \nachieved by natural cycle or by a withdrawal bleed induced by Provera 10mg \ntwice a day or norethisterone 5mg three times a day for seven days. \nTreatment was scheduled ten days after stopping the tablets. \n \nTreatments were performed in day surgery theatres unless there were specific \npatient medical contraindications, for example BMI outwith the day surgery \nrange. Treatments were either performed under general anaesthetic or local \nanaesthetic, with or without conscious sedation dependant on patient \npreference. Patients received a 100mg Diclofenac suppository 1 hour prior to \ntreatment (patients in whom this was contraindicated received 1g \n - 8 - \nParacetamol rectally). Intravenous access was achieved prior to \ncommencement of the procedure. Those opting for local anaesthesia received \na four quadrant intracervical block using four 2.2ml ampoules of Citanest (3% \nPrilocaine with Felypressin 2.2ml). They were offered intravenous sedation \nwith Midazolam (2-4mg iv), either from the outset or at their request intra-\noperatively. If intra-operative analgesia was required intravenous Fentanyl \nwas given (25-50mcgs). A member of theatre staff provided reassurance and \nverbal support throughout the procedure. Patient oxygen saturation and heart \nrate were monitored throughout the procedure.  \nThe cervix was then dilated to 9mm for the MEATM group and 5mm if \nnecessary for the TBall group. A gas hysteroscopy (or saline if the view was \npoor, was then performed in all patients to identify the cavity and exclude \nfalse passages or perforations, immediately prior to device insertion. Women \nwith submucous fibroids of less than 3cm were treated in the same fashion as \nthose with normal cavities. Intrauterine polpys were removed under direct \nvision and treated in the same fashion, provided prior histology was within \nnormal limits. Microwave ablation was performed in the standard fashion.21 \nThe TBall procedure was adapted from the standard method9 by adding fluid \nto the balloon if necessary during the treatment cycle in order to maintain \nintracavity pressure at 160 -180mmHg. Total procedure time was taken from \ninsertion of intra venous access to the patient leaving theatre. Procedure time \n(ablation) was taken from insertion of probe to removal of probe.  \n \nPost operatively, once comfortable, voiding and tolerating diet; patients were \ndischarged with an information sheet and contact telephone number.  \n - 9 - \n \nObjectives \nTo compare the clinical outcomes of microwave endometrial ablation (MEATM) \nand thermal balloon ablation (TBall) for the treatment of heavy menstrual \nbleeding. \n \nOutcomes \nPrimary outcomes were satisfaction and menstrual scores one year. \nSecondary outcomes were operative differences, acceptability of treatment, \nand changes in health related quality of life.. \nPatients completed pre-operative questionnaires to obtain baseline menstrual \ndetails. These included both PBLAC22 and a menstrual bleeding and pain \nscore used in previous endometrial ablation trials from this centre.7,23-25 The \nwoman rated the blood loss on a scale from 1 least to 5 greatest for each day \nof her period. These values were then added for a total menstrual blood loss \nscore. Menstrual pain was rated in an identical manner, in order to give a total \npain score for the period. Baseline health-related quality of life parameters \n(Short form 1226 and EQ-5D27) and an assessment of anxiety\/ depression \n(Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score28) were also completed. \n \nThe questionnaires were repeated post treatment, at two weeks, six months \nand one year following the procedure.  \nAcceptability of the procedure and a pain questionnaire were completed on \nthe day of surgery and two weeks post operatively. Acceptability of the \nprocedure was assessed using a six-point scale and on a 10cm visual \n - 10 - \nanalogue scale (0cm = totally acceptable, 10cm = totally unacceptable). Pain \nwas assessed using a modified version of the McGill Questionnaire29. \nSatisfaction with the outcome was measured at one year post procedure on a \nsix-point scale from  totally satisfied through to totally dissatisfied. \n \nSample Size \nIt was calculated a priori that 290 patients would be required to achieve 80% \npower to detect a 12% difference in those totally or generally satisfied with \ntreatment.  This number gives 80% power to detect a 15% difference in \namenorrhoea rates (2p < 0.05). This is based on the only randomised trial \nevidence that established amenorrhoea rates for MEA\u2122 at one year of 40 % \nand of TBall of around 20%. 20,21 This number of patients would also give 90% \npower to detect a difference in menstrual scores (pictorial blood loss \nassessment chart, PBLAC) of 10, again significant at the 5% level.  To \naccount for drop outs 320 women were recruited to the trial. Previous ablation \nstudies at this centre have shown up to a 20% loss to follow up by five years. \n \nRandomisation \nPatients were randomised in a ratio of 1:1 to the MEATM and TBall arms of the \nstudy. Computer generated randomly permuted blocks were used with a \ntelephone randomisation service based on a separate site to achieve \nconcealment.  \n \nBlinding  \n - 11 - \nThe treatment allocation was not revealed to the participants during the \ncourse of the study. Outcome assessment was collected by means of patient \ncompleted questionnaires with the exception of the operative questionnaire \ndata. The data was entered and analysed independently by researchers \nunaware of the treatment allocation. \n \nStatistical analysis \nAll statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS v14 unless otherwise \nstated. Intention to treat analysis was utilised; that is each participant \nremained in their initially allocated group irrespective of the treatment \nreceived. A 95% confidence interval for the difference in proportions was \ncalculated in Excel using Newcombe\u2019s method.30 Health related quality of life \nmeasures (EQ-5D and SF-12 scores) were compared using a linear \nregression model to estimate the mean difference between groups, after \nadjusting for baseline values. Where appropriate, to account for skewness \nand an excess number of zeroes in an outcome, a zero inflated negative \nbinomial regression model31 was used to estimate the incidence rate ratio \n(IRR) and 95% confidence intervals between groups,  using STATA 9SE.  \nAdjustment was made in the model for baseline values.  The McGill pain \nscore was generated using the rank weight method with a comparison \nbetween groups made using a Mann-Whitney test. The acceptability visual \nanalogue scale was also compared using a Mann-Whitney test.  Procedure \ntimes were compared using an independent t-test. A zero value was imputed \nfor twelve months bleeding\/pain scores PBLAC where the participant had \n - 12 - \nstated they no longer having periods. The CONSORT scheme32 of reporting \nwas adhered to. \n \n \nResults  \nStudy recruitment commenced in January 2004 and treatments were \ncompleted by January 2007. Three hundred and twenty women were \nrandomised with 157 in each arm receiving treatment (Figure1). There were \nsix post randomisation exclusions (four withdrew consent and two were found \nto be unsuitable for treatment following randomisation.) These women are not \nincluded in the analysis as they withdrew prior to treatment. \nThree patients withdrew following treatment one in the MEATM arm and two in \nthe TBall arm. \n \nAS, a specialist registrar (trainee) undertook the majority of the procedures \nunder indirect supervision,  (93%) with a consultant, K.C., undertaking the \nremainder.  \n \nBaseline characteristics for both groups were very similar (Table 1). \n \nThe number of participants who received their allocated treatments is reported \nin table 2. Three women in the MEATM arm were found to have unsuitable \ncavities of greater than 12cm on the day of surgery, despite pre assessment \nin a gynaecology clinic. These women underwent TCRE.  Four women in the \nTBall arm were also found to have unsuitable uterine cavities of greater than \n - 13 - \n12 cm; two underwent TCRE, one had a rollerball and underwent \nhysterectomy.  The single device failure in the MEA\u2122 arm was due to \nmoisture in the data cable, this patient underwent TCRE. The eleven device \nfailures in the TBall arm were all due to failure in maintaining a stable \nintrauterine pressure despite an intact uterine cavity. Four of these women \nunderwent TCRE, two had rollerball ablation and five women had MEA\u2122. A \nfailure in the sterile services department affected one operating list, leading to \none woman in the MEATM arm having rollerball ablation and one woman \nhaving TBall. 19% of women in the MEATM arm and 14% of the TBall arm had \neither polyps or fibroids in the uterine cavity. Women were free to choose their \nmethod of anaesthetic either local or general. Similar numbers of around 60% \nin each group requested the procedure under general anaesthetic. In those \nwho chose local anaesthetic there were no failures or conversion to general \nanaesthetic in either group. \n \nOperative differences show a significant difference between MEATM and TBall \nin total procedure time (from insertion of intravenous access to leaving \ntheatre, (mean difference -5.9 min, 95% CI -8.5 min, -3.3 min) and in \nprocedure time (insertion of probe to removal of probe (mean difference -6.6 \nmin; 95% CI -7.4 min, -5.8 min) (Table 2). The median procedure related \ndiscomfort of both procedures was 3 on a scale of 1 none to 6 excruciating). \n \nA further difference was demonstrated in the requirement for opiate analgesia \nand antiemetic medication between the two groups (Table 3), with the MEATM \ngroup requiring significantly less (difference -22%, 95% CI (-32%, -11%)). \n - 14 - \nThere were no serious complications in either group. By six hours, \nsignificantly more of the MEATM group 124 (79%) were suitable for discharge \nhome compared to 106 (68%) of the TBall group (difference 11%, 95% CI 1%, \n20%).  \n \nHigh levels of acceptability with the procedure were found in both groups at \ntwo weeks with 118 (81%) of the MEA\u2122 group and 122 (87%) of the TBall \ngroup describing their treatment as totally or generally acceptable (difference \nin proportion -6%; 95% CI -15%, 2%).   There was a high level of satisfaction \nat twelve months with 109 (76%) of the MEA\u2122 group and 103 (77%) of the \nTBall group described themselves as totally or generally satisfied with their \nprocedure (difference in proportion -1%, 95% CI -11%, 9 %). The majority of \nwomen 91% for MEATM and 92% for TBall would recommend the treatment to \na friend at twelve months.  \n \n \nMenstrual outcomes between the two groups were comparable at twelve \nmonths (Table 4) both for PBLAC, pain and bleeding scores. 41% of the \nMEATM group and 38% of the TBall group were amenorrhoeic. There were six \nhysterectomies in the MEATM group and six in the TBall group (0.03%, 95% CI \n(-5%, 5%) ). Quality of life scores (both physical and mental components) \nwere not significantly different between the groups (Figure 2). \n \nDiscussion \n - 15 - \nThis study demonstrates that MEATM and TBall are both acceptable \ntreatments which achieve high satisfaction rates for patients wishing treatment \nfor their heavy menses. Patient quality of life shows an overall sustained \nimprovement following both treatments.  \n \nThermal balloon ablation achieved a high rate of amenorrhoea in this study \nwhen compared to previous reported randomised controlled trials.9,17,18 This \nmay be due to the active circulation of fluid within the Thermachoice III \ncatheters.33 We feel that the addition of fluid into the balloon during the \ntreatment cycle to maintain the treatment pressure above 160mmhg may also \nbe important. This is not recommended practice by the manufacturer, at \npresent. The amenorrhoea rates for microwave ablation are at the lower end \nof reports from other randomised trials from this and other centres7,8 This may \nrepresent the relative inexperience of the surgeon with this technique. The \ntrainee had five years experience of the TBall technique, but had only recently \nbeen trained in the microwave procedure, having done five procedures \nindependently prior to starting the trial.  \n \n \nIt was felt important that the patients received treatment on the day of \nattending for surgery and hence an alternative method was used if there was \na failure of the allocated treatment. \n \nBoth techniques are amenable to use under local anaesthesia with or without \nsedation. No patient required conversion to a general anaesthetic, this \n - 16 - \nconcurs with previous trials evaluating MEA\u2122 under local anaesthesia and in \nthe office setting.21-23 \n \nDifferences in time to discharge were not affected by timing of the theatre \nlists. The majority of patients were operated on in the afternoon research \noperating list with only those women with medical reasons being performed \non a morning in-patient list. There was no difference in timing of procedure on \nthe lists between the two groups. Patients were given the next space on the \nresearch list following randomisation, minimising potential bias in this respect.  \n \nThe operative time differences between the two groups were predictable. \nTBall requires several minutes in order to achieve a stable intrauterine \npressure and pre heating phase prior to the eight minute treatment cycle. The \ntreatment cycle for MEATM can begin immediately after insertion of the probe.  \n \nProcedure failures are an important consideration when choosing a second \ngeneration method. There was only one MEA\u2122 device failure with eleven \ndevice failures in the TBall arm. These tended to be in women with large \ncavities and wide intercornual distances where it was not possible to achieve \nadequate intrauterine pressures in order to start the treatment cycle.  The \ndevice failure in the MEA\u2122 arm was due to moisture within the data cable. If \ndisposable MEA\u2122 probes (Femwave\u2122) had been used this would not have \noccurred. \n \n - 17 - \nIn this study no serious complications occurred with either technique. We feel \nthat routine hysteroscopy prior to the start of the ablation minimises the risks \nof complications by excluding perforation and false passage, and confirmation \nof endometrial cavity by visualising cornuae.. There are documented cases of \nperforation and visceral damage for both techniques on the MAUDE \ndatabase. \n \nThe generalisability of the results to a wider population is enhanced by the \navoidance of entry criteria based on menstrual blood loss scores or a regular, \nnormal sized uterine cavity, making this truly pragmatic. The results of the \nstudy would be genuinely reproducible if the practice of maintaining balloon \nwere to become accepted practice. If not it is possible that lower amenorrhoea \nrates would occur following balloon ablation. \n \nThis is the first randomised controlled trial between these two second-\ngeneration ablation techniques. Whilst it appears that both treatments are as \nefficacious as each other, with the exception of a larger uterine cavit;, in a \nclimate of financial restraint MEA\u2122 may have an economic advantage over \nTBall. Long-term follow up will be performed to compare satisfaction, \nmenstrual outcomes and rates of further surgery between the two groups. The \nmajority of repeat procedures and hysterectomies are known to take place \nwithin 24 months of MEA\u2122, and rarely after three years.7   \n \nIn conclusion both MEA\u2122 and TBall achieve high levels of patient satisfaction \nand are acceptable to patients. Both techniques have similar effectiveness at \n - 18 - \nleast up to a twelve month follow-up. MEA\u2122 is quicker, has less failures, isnot \nlimited by the larger cavity and leads to quicker discharge.This  provides \nvaluable information to healthcare purchasers looking to purchase a second \ngeneration ablation device. \nAcknowledgments \nThis study was funded by a grant awarded by the Chief Scientists Office, \nScottish Government Health Directorates.
