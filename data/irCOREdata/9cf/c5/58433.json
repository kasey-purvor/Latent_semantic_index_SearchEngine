The terrane is bounded to the \nnorth by the Highland Boundary Fault Zone and to the south by the Southern Upland \nFault. The role of the Midland Valley in the history of Caledonian terrane accretion \nhas long been the source of interest and speculation. Lambert & McKerrow (1976), \nLeggett (1980) and Leggett et al. (1982), amongst others, regarded the Lower \nPalaeozoic sedimentary rocks of the Midland Valley terrane as having been deposited \nin a fore-arc basin that divided the accretionary complex of the Southern Uplands \nterrane, from a basement-arc terrane to the north. In another interpretation, sediment \nderived from uplift of the Grampian terrane was dispersed across the Midland Valley \nand accumulated within the postulated Southern Uplands trench (Hutchison & Oliver \n1998; Oliver et al. 2000). Alternatively, for most of the Ordovician to earliest \nDevonian interval, the Midland Valley terrane may have formed an arc-inter arc \nregion which supplied sediment into a fore-arc basin located immediately to the south \n(Bluck, et al. 1980; Bluck 1983, 1984; Smith et al. 2001; Bluck et al. 2006). \nThe structural geometry of the Southern Uplands terrane is consistent with it \nhaving developed as an accretionary thrust complex at the Laurentian continental \nmargin during northward subduction of the Iapetus Ocean. The evolution of this \nterrane has been interpreted in terms of a fore-arc, supra-subduction zone prism \n(McKerrow et al. 1977; Leggett et al. 1979; Leggett et al. 1982; Leggett 1987; \nNeedham 2004), although the northern (Ordovician) part has also been interpreted as \na subsiding, fore-arc shelf sequence rather than trench deposits (Armstrong et al. \n1996; Armstrong & Owen 2001). In an alternative model, the terrane is envisaged as \nhaving developed from an Ordovician back-arc setting into a mid-Silurian foreland \nbasin that migrated onto the Avalonian continent following closure of the Iapetus \nOcean (Morris 1987; Stone et al. 1987; Kneller 1991; Kneller et al. 1993). A recent \nevaluation of the basin thermal history in the Southern Uplands terrane has ruled out \nthe back-arc component of this model (Stone & Merriman 2004), but the later \nevolution into a foreland fold and thrust belt remains likely, as does some link with \nthe wholly Avalonian development of the coeval Windermere Supergroup foreland \nbasin in the southern Lake District. \n 2\nUntil recently the presence of fresh, southerly derived andesitic detritus within \nsome of the turbiditic sandstones of the Southern Uplands (most notably the \nCaradocian Portpatrick and Galdenoch formations) had been assumed to provide \nevidence for the existence of an Ordovician supra-subduction volcanic arc, either in \nthe Midland Valley (accretionary model, with axially deflected turbidite flow) or \noffshore (back-arc model, with primary southern derivation). However, the age profile \nof detrital zircons from the Portpatrick Formation sandstones are typical of Gondwana \nand Avalonia, recording much older Neoproterozoic volcanism (U-Pb 557 \u00b1 6 Ma and \n613 \u00b1 12 Ma; Phillips et al. 2003; also see Kelley & Bluck 1989, 1990), rather than \nshowing evidence for a contemporaneous volcanic arc. If the volcaniclastic detritus \nwas indeed Avalonian it was introduced into the sedimentary basins developed \nmarginal to Laurentian continent as early as the Caradoc, with profound implications \nfor the palaeogeography of the Iapetus Ocean. An Avalonian source also fitted with \nisotope studies which showed that Grampian Terrane Dalradian Supergroup rocks \nwere an unlikely source for the northerly derived, quartzofeldspathic units such as the \nbroadly contemporaneous Kirkcolm Formation in the Southern Uplands. Smith et al. \n(2001) have suggested that one potential source of detritus for the northerly derived  \nsandstones of the Ordovician northern part of the Southern Uplands terrane lay within \nthe Midland Valley. However, the detrital zircon study of Waldron et al. (2008) has \ndemonstrated that the late Ordovician sandstones of the northern belt of the Southern \nUplands could well have been largely derived from a Laurentian source. This leaves \nthe depositional setting and provenance of the Ordovician to Silurian strata of the \nMidland Valley terrane as poorly understood elements in the early Palaeozoic \npalaeogeography of the Scottish sector of the Iapetus Ocean.  \nThe primary objective of this paper is to reassess the evolution of the Midland \nValley terrane during the Early Palaeozoic in the light of laser ablation U-Pb ages \nobtained for the detrital zircon populations within the sandstones of the March Wood, \nHareshaw Conglomerate, Parishholm Conglomerate, Cock Rig and Craigskelly \nConglomerate formations. These data provide important age constraints on the source \nterrane which fed sediment into the sedimentary basins along the Laurentian \ncontinental margin. \n \nThe Lower Palaeozoic strata of the Midland Valley terrane \n 3\nThe Lower Palaeozoic sedimentary rocks of the Midland Valley terrane are mostly \nfound close to its southern margin (Fig. 2). The Ordovician sequence only occurs in \nthe southwest around Girvan and ranges from Llanvirn to Ashgill in age (Williams \n1962; Ingham 1978; Stone & Smellie 1988). It consists of a thick sequence of \nnorthwest-derived conglomerates, turbiditic sandstones and shallow water limestones \nwhich unconformably overlie the Tremadoc to Arenig Ballantrae ophiolitic complex. \nThe Llanvirn to Caradoc sedimentary sequence includes the conglomeratic Kirkland, \nBenan and Kilranny formations which are interpreted as having been deposited in a \nproximal fore-arc basin to the Midland Valley volcanic arc, situated to the north, \nwhich was founded upon a basement of older (possibly Precambrian) metamorphic \nrocks intruded by granitic plutonic rocks (Bluck et al. 1980; Bluck 1984; Smith et al. \n2001; Bluck et al. 2006). The Benan and Kilranny conglomerates are characterised by \nthe presence of large granitic clasts which have yielded ages in the range 590 to 450 \nMa (Rb-Sr; Longman et al. 1979), implying a prolonged period of granite intrusion. \nThe source of these rocks is presently unknown as is the origin of an early Tremadoc \nlimestone boulder described by Rushton & Tripp (1979) from the Benan \nConglomerate. The granitic clast content of the Benan Conglomerate has been related \nto granitic magmatism and uplift in the source area to the north, with the variation in \nthickness of the conglomerate being used as evidence for oblique slip on \ncontemporaneous faults located along the northern margin of Iapetus (Ince, 1984). \nThe older Kirkland Conglomerate is dominated by detritus derived from the \nBallantrae ophiolitic complex, an obducted fragment of an arc\/back-arc assemblage \ncomposed of serpentinised ultramafic rocks, gabbroic intrusions, and early Ordovician \nwithin-plate and island-arc lavas (including primitive island-arc tholeiites and \nboninites; see Smellie & Stone 1992, 2001; Smellie et al. 1995), and volcaniclastic \nrocks (containing Arenig fossils, Stone & Rushton 1983). This imbricated, supra-\nsubduction zone ophiolitic assemblage was emplaced northwards onto the southern \nmargin of the Midland Valley terrane in response to arc-continent collision and \nsubsequent reversal in subduction polarity (Smellie & Stone 2001) at the end of the \nArenig (478 \u00b1 8 Ma; Bluck et al. 1980; Stone & Rushton 2003). The Ordovician \nconglomeratic sedimentary rocks of the Girvan area were then deposited in a \nproximal, fore-arc basin to the postulated Midland Valley arc system that developed \nafter the obduction of the Ballantrae complex, possibly during the Llanvirn, when \n 4\nsubduction of the Iapetus Ocean lithosphere had been established beneath the \nLaurentian continental margin.  \nIn the southern Midland Valley, Llandovery to Wenlock rocks crop out in a \nseries of inliers (Fig. 2): (i) the Pentland Hills inliers; (ii) the south central inliers \n(Hagshaw Hills, Lesmahagow, Carmichael and Eastfield); and (iii) the Girvan inliers \nwhere the Silurian rocks unconformably overlie Ordovician strata. In general, the \nSilurian inliers record the transition from an older (Llandovery) transgressive marine \nsequence (including turbiditic sandstones) to a younger (Lower Wenlock) regressive \nterrestrial succession (Cocks & Toghill 1973; Rolfe 1960, 1961; Rolfe & Fritz 1966; \nCameron & Stephenson 1985; Robertson 1989; Smith 1995; Clarkson et al. 2001). \nDifferences between the individual inliers in the thicknesses of the sequences and \ntheir detailed stratigraphy reflect deposition within a series of small, strike-slip sub-\nbasins developed oblique to the major northeast-trending Caledonian structural \nlineaments (Williams & Harper 1988; Smith 1995; Phillips et al. 1998). This Lower \nSilurian sub-basin architecture continued into the Upper Silurian and controlled the \ndeposition of the redbed fluviatile sandstones and alluvial fan conglomerates which \nform the lower part of the overlying (and partly Devonian) Lanark Group. Provenance \nstudies, in particular Phillips et al. (2004), have shown that strata of the Silurian \ninliers and Siluro-Devonian Lanark Group sedimentary rocks were derived from the \nsame source, which included volcanic and hypabyssal igneous rocks, a wacke \nsandstone-dominated sedimentary sequence, granitic plutonic rocks and older \nmetamorphic rocks (also see McGiven 1967; Bluck 1983; Heinz & Loeschke 1988; \nSyba 1989). Minor differences in sandstone composition between the inliers reflect \nthe influence of the sub-basin architecture on sediment dispersal patterns. \nPalaeocurrent evidence shows that sources lay both to the north and south, leading to \nthe conclusion that they were located within an originally much wider Midland Valley \nterrane (Bluck 1983, 1984; Smith 1995; Phillips et al. 1998). Apart from thin calc-\nalkaline, rhyodacitic metabentonite beds (Batchelor & Clarkson 1993) in the late \nLlandovery to early Wenlock succession of the Pentland Hills inlier, there is no \nunequivocal evidence of contemporaneous volcanism within the Lower Palaeozoic \nsuccession of the southern Midland Valley. \nThe remainder of the Lanark Group (Lower Devonian) was deposited in a \nlinear, northeast\u2013southwest-trending basin (the Lanark Basin; Bluck 1984, 2000) that \ndeveloped during a phase of transtension that was accompanied by the eruption of \n 5\nSiluro-Devonian calc-alkaline volcanic rocks. Conglomerates within the Siluro-\nDevonian sequence of the northeast Midland Valley (Strathmore Basin) contain a \ndiverse suite of granitic clasts which yield ages of between 475-457 Ma (Rb-Sr \nmuscovite-whole-rock; U-Pb monazite), as well as detritus derived from a \u2018cryptic \ngreywacke source\u2019 located within the Midland Valley terrane (Haughton et al. 1990; \nHaughton & Halliday 1991). Although metamorphic detritus derived from \nNeoproterozoic Dalradian rocks north of the Midland Valley terrane does occur \nwithin the Upper Silurian strata from the Strathmore Basin (Phillips et al. 1998), none \nhas been recognised unequivocally within the sandstones of the Lanark Basin or older \nSilurian sub-basins (Phillips et al. 2004).  \n \nSandstone petrography and provenance \nFive samples of medium- to coarse-grained and granule sandstone from the Girvan, \nHagshaw Hills, Eastfield and North Esk (Pentlands) inliers were selected for isotopic \nanalysis (Figs. 2 and 3, and Table 1). The results quantify the spatial and temporal \nchanges in sandstone provenance from Lower Llandovery to Mid-Wenlock times.  \nThe medium- to very coarse-grained sandstones are texturally and \ncompositionally immature rocks with a closely packed, grain-supported texture (Fig. \n4). Although traces of chloritic, carbonate and\/or clay cements are present, pressure \nsolution during compaction is the main mode of cementation. The sandstones are \ntypically composed of angular to subangular, low sphericity clasts of mono- and \npolycrystalline quartz, plagioclase and variably altered rock fragments (Table 2). \nAlthough the lithic fragments are largely composed of fine- to very fine-grained \nigneous rocks (basalt, aphyric to feldspar-phyric andesite, aphyric to quartz-feldspar-\nphyric rhyolite\/rhyodacite, trachytic rock, microgranite), there are also sedimentary \n(chert, mudstone, siltstone) and metasedimentary (quartzite, meta-quartz arenite, \nphyllite, metasandstone) rock fragments (Table 2). This clast assemblage is consistent \nwith these sedimentary rocks having been derived from a recycled orogenic \nprovenance, comprising an eroded volcanic or igneous complex with an associated \nsedimentary cover, founded upon an older metamorphic basement (cf. Phillips et al. \n2004). Minor differences in sandstone composition between the clastic sequences \nwithin the individual inliers are thought to record localised changes in the \ncomposition of the source terrane, and\/or sediment dispersal patterns within \nindividual sub-basins (Phillips et al. 2004). \n 6\nThe Lower Llandovery Craigskelly Conglomerate Formation (c. 40 m thick in \nthe Girvan inlier) consists of well-rounded pebbles, cobbles and boulders of \nmudstone, granite, jasper, chert, felsite, microgabbro, gabbro, serpentinite and quartz \n(Cameron et al. 1986). The interbedded sandstone (sample N5075, Table 2) contains a \nsimilar range of igneous rock fragments (including serpentinite and basalt), as well as \ndetritus derived from sedimentary and metamorphic rocks. The northeast-derived, \nUpper Llandovery Cock Rig Formation (North Esk, Pentland Hills inlier) sandstone \n(N5071) is broadly similar in composition to the Craigskelly sandstone, though this \nyounger sandstone lacks serpentinite lithic clasts and contains a slightly higher \nproportion of metasedimentary rock fragments (Table 2).  \nThe Lower Wenlock Parishholm Conglomerate Formation (N5067) and Mid-\nWenlock Hareshaw Conglomerate Formation (N5068) sandstones (both from the \nHagshaw Hills inliers) were derived from the southeast. Although the lithic-rich \nsandstones within both of these formations are compositionally similar to the \nLlandovery sandstones, they also contain minor, but significant, amounts of \nmetamorphic (quartz-schist, quartzofeldspathic mylonite, metabasalt) and granitic \n(diorite\/granodiorites, micrographic granite, microdiorite) rock fragments (Table 2). \nThe southeast-derivation of the Parishholm and Hareshaw conglomerate formations \nindicates that the recycled orogenic provenance which supplied detritus to the Lower \nPalaeozoic sedimentary sequences of the southern Midland Valley terrane was much \nwider than the current area of the terrane and extended much further to the south. The \nMid-Wenlock March Wood Formation (Eastfield inlier) sandstone (N5065) is the \nmost fine grained of the sandstones analysed. The fluviatile sandstone sequence of the \nMarch Wood Formation contains conglomerate inter-beds with quartzite pebbles; the \nFormation\u2019s provenance may be expected to that of the Hareshaw Conglomerate, \nthough the sequence is slightly younger in age (Fig. 3). \nZircon has been identified in all the sandstones (Table 2), occurring as: (i) \nlarge, rounded detrital grains; (ii) rounded, dusty looking crystals included within \nmetasedimentary rock fragments; (iii) equant to rod-shaped, anhedral to subhedral \ncrystals included within plagioclase and quartz, and more rarely muscovite and \nbiotite; and (iv) equant to rod-shaped, faceted crystals within granitic lithic clasts.  \n \nZircon age data \n 7\nData were collected using laser ablation multi-collector ICP-MS. Details of the \nanalytical protocol and instrumental set-up can be found in Appendix 1. \nA number of general observations can be made regarding the detrital zircon \npopulations within the Llandovery to Wenlock sandstones of the Midland Valley (see \nFig. 6): (i) detrital zircon populations present in all five samples, irrespective of \nstratigraphical age, comprise a younger, Lower Palaeozoic component and an older \npredominantly Mesoproterozoic component (Figs. 5 and 6); (ii) the Lower Palaeozoic \ncontribution in general becomes progressively \u2018younger\u2019 as the depositional age of the \nhost rock becomes stratigraphically younger (Fig. 6); (iii) the younger limit of the \nMesoproterozoic detrital zircon population becomes slightly younger as the host rocks \nget stratigraphically younger (Fig. 6); and (iv) the contribution of zircons from \nNeoproterozoic and Archaean rocks to the Midland Valley Silurian sediment was \nconsistent but relatively minor. \n \nCraigskelly Conglomerate Formation \nThe younger component within the sandstone (N5075) from the Craigskelly \nConglomerate Formation (Lower Llandovery, northwest-derived) is dominantly \nArenig\/Llanvirn (c. 475) (c. 30 Ma older than age of host sediment). The Lower \nPalaeozoic part of the detrital zircon population is thought to be dating the granitic to \nrhyolitic igneous component present within the Craigskelly Conglomerate Formation \nsandstone. The age of the Lower Palaeozoic detrital zircon population within this \nsandstone is comparable to the dates obtained from granitic boulders (Rb-Sr dates \n470-560 Ma, Longman 1980; Longman et al. 1979) within the underlying Caradocian \nBenan and Kilranny conglomerate formations, which have a similar provenance \npetrographically.  \nThe Craigskelly Conglomerate Formation sandstone also contains significant \nMesoproterozoic peaks (c. 1020, 1170, 1370 Ma, Figs. 5a and 6a) and much smaller \nolder Palaeoproterozoic (Figs. 5a and 6a) detrital zircon components. The \nMesoproterozoic component is most abundant at c. 1000 Ma (Fig. 6a), but there are \nno younger Proterozoic zircons present. \n \nCock Rig Formation \nData obtained for the Cock Rig Formation sandstone (N5071) (Upper Llandovery, \nnortheast-derived) in the Pentland Hills are broadly similar to that for the Craigskelly \n 8\nConglomerate Formation deposited at the other end of the Midland Valley. Present \nare the younger Arenig (c. 485 Ma; Figs. 5b and 6b) and older Mesoproterozoic \n(1110, 1180, 1540 Ma; Figs. 5b and 6b) components and an minor Late Archaean (c. \n2.7 Ga) component.  \n \nParishholm Conglomerate Formation \nThe detrital population within the southeast-derived Parishholm Conglomerate \nFormation (Lower Wenlock, c. 428 Ma) has a range of younger detrital zircons from \nArenig (c. 475 Ma; Figs. 5c and 6c). This sandstone (N5071) is, however, \ndistinguished from the Llandovery sandstones by a greater contribution from \nLlandovery\/Ashgill (c. 445 Ma; Fig. 6c) zircons, as well as by a restricted \nMesoproterozoic component (peaks at c. 1011, 1050, 1170 Ma; Fig. 6c). The \nParishholm sandstone also contains Palaeoproterozoic and Neoarchaean components. \nThe Parishholm Conglomerate Formation is dominated by igneous detritus (see Table \n2) suggesting that the Lower Palaeozoic component of the detrital zircon population is \npredominantly derived from a granitic to rhyolitic igneous source. The overall \nsimilarity in detrital zircon data from the Craigskelly, Cock Rig and Parishholm \nformation sandstones, combined with the results of the petrological provenance study, \nstrongly suggests that the same\/similar source which supplied detritus to the Silurian \nsandstones extended throughout the Midland Valley terrane. \n \nHareshaw Conglomerate Formation \nIn contrast to the Parishholm Conglomerate Formation, the southeast-derived \nHareshaw Conglomerate (mid-Wenlock), is rich in metamorphic detritus which is \napparently reflected in its detrital zircon population. Uniquely amongst the Silurian \nsandstones analysed, the Hareshaw sandstone (N5068) is dominated by \nMesoproterozoic zircons (c. 965, 1020, 1050 Ma; Figs 5d and 6d). The much reduced \nLower Palaeozoic component is Caradoc in age. \n \nMarch Wood Formation \nThe sandstone (N5065) from the March Wood Formation, also mid-Wenlock (c. 426 \nMa) but probably the youngest sandstone analysed (Fig. 3), shows a return to a \nbroadly bimodal population comprising a Llandovery (c. 430 Ma) and \nArenig\/Llanvirn (c. 480 Ma; Figs. 5e and 6e) contribution and an older \n 9\nMesoproterozoic (c. 1000-1800 Ma; Figs. 5e and 6e) component. The Llandovery \ninfluence is most pronounced within the March Wood Formation demonstrating the \nincrease in the importance of this young\/juvenile source within the mid-Silurian. \n \nDiscussion \nComparison of the zircon populations in the Midland Valley sandstones \nSince the detrital zircon populations of the Midland valley sandstones (irrespective of \nstratigraphical age) possess a younger lower Palaeozoic component and older \npredominantly Mesoproterozoic component, there appears to be a common factor to \nthe source areas, even though they were deposited by currents from different \ndirections into different sub-basins (see Phillips et al. 1998, 2004). The sandstones \nwere deposited in relatively small strike-slip sub-basins (Smith 1995; Phillips et al. \n1998) and the source areas were probably less than 100 km distant. Erosion of horsts \nand rift shoulders was most likely to have contributed to the sub-basin fill. It is \nimportant to assess whether the zircon content of the samples is first cycle or recycled \nfrom pre-existing sedimentary sources. \nThe abundance of zircons of c. 1000 Ma suggests a Grenvillian source from \nLaurentia, but some models show that a Sveconorwegian source (Cawood et al. 2007; \ncf. the Telemarkian magmatic events in their fig. 4) could be a more likely for \nsoutherly derived material as Baltica is placed relatively close to the south of \nLaurentia at around 600 Ma and again as Iapetus closed at around 450 Ma. The \ngeneral lack of late Neoproterozoic ages (c. 557 Ma) eliminates an Avalonian source \nfor the detritus being supplied to the Silurian basins of the Midland Valley. The \nsoutherly derived sandstones in the Midland Valley have a more varied zircon \npopulation than those derived from the north of this terrane. Besides the dominant \nMesoproterozoic grains, the southern source also provided Palaeoproterozoic, \nNeoarchaean and Palaeoarchaean grains. Whereas, the northerly derived sandstones \ncontain a restricted population, which in addition to the Mesoproterozoic grains \nincludes only a few Neoarchaean grains with or without Palaeoproterozoic \nrepresentatives. By comparison the March Wood Formation, with an undetermined \nsource-direction, has a similar population to the northwest-derived Craigskelly \nConglomerate and so was probably sourced from the north. Possibly this reflects a \nless deeply eroded \u201cbasement\u201d in this northerly source area. \n 10\nThe Parishholm Conglomerate and Hareshaw Conglomerate formations occur \nwithin the Hagshaw inlier and as such are likely to have shared a common source. The \nslightly older Parishholm Conglomerate, however, contains more felsic\/acidic clasts \nof Llandovery-Arenig age. This situation might be expected in deposits derived from \nthe unroofing of a source area in which arc-related rocks overlie a metamorphic \nbasement. \nThe March Wood Formation could have been derived from a similar source to \nthe Parishholm Conglomerate Formation, but is less likely to have come from the \nsame source as the Hareshaw Conglomerate, which is of a similar age, but in a \nseparate inlier\/sub-basin. \nLlandovery-age zircons are not detected in the Craigskelly, Cock Rig and \nHareshaw formations, but are present in the Wenlockian Parishholm Conglomerate \nand March Wood formations. It is known from interbedded metabentonite layers that \nthere was penecontemporaneous volcanism affecting the southern Midland Valley in \nthe Silurian. The metabentonites are rhyodacitic and contain euhedral zircon among \nother minerals. They are recorded from, for example, the Wether Law Linn Formation \n(Upper Llandovery to Wenlock age) just above the Cock Rig Formation (Batchelor & \nClarkson 1993), and just below in the Llandovery Reservoir Formation (Batchelor \n1999) of the Pentland Hills North Esk inlier (Fig. 3). A further metabentonite occurs \nwithin the Ree Burn Formation (Upper Llandovery), which lies just below the \nParishholm Conglomerate in the Hagshaw Hills inlier (Batchelor 1999).  \n \nProvenance of the Ordovician-Silurian sedimentary sequences  \nin the Midland Valley terrane \nDetrital zircon populations within the Silurian sandstones sampled from the southern \nMidland Valley are bimodal and clearly record the input of sediment from two main \nsources; a Lower Palaeozoic source and an older, predominantly Mesoproterozoic, \nbasement (Figs. 5 and 6), or alternatively as a result of the recycling of an older \nsedimentary sequence.  \nIt has been argued that the uplift of metamorphic rocks of the Grampian \nterrane shed detritus across the Midland Valley, which was then deposited within the \nSouthern Uplands sedimentary basin (Hutchison & Oliver 1998; Oliver et al. 2000). \nAlthough metamorphic detritus derived from the Grampian terrane is a common \ncomponent within the Siluro-Devonian sandstones and conglomerates of the northern \n 11\nMidland Valley (Haughton & Bluck 1989; Phillips et al. 1998), no unequivocal \nlithologies derived from the Grampian, Northern Highlands and Hebridean terranes \n(Fig. 1) have been recognised within the Silurian inliers or Devonian (Old Red \nSandstone facies) sandstones of the southern Midland Valley (Phillips et al. 2004). \nThe metasedimentary rocks of the Neoproterozoic Dalradian Supergroup, which crop \nout extensively along the southern margin of the Grampian terrane, are typically well-\nendowed with Archaean and late Palaeoproterozoic zircons (Cawood et al. 2003, \n2007). The age profile of the detrital zircon populations (see Figs. 5 and 6) present \nwithin the sandstones of the southern Midland Valley, with their scarcity of Archean \nand late Palaeoproterozoic ages, clearly demonstrate that the Grampian terrane did not \nsupply detritus to these Ordovician-Silurian sedimentary basins. Instead, the 1000-\n1800 Ma component was largely derived from a Mesoproterozoic (Grenvillian) source \nnot represented in the Dalradian. Haughton (1988) and Haughton et al. (1990) \ndemonstrated that a so called \u2018cryptic source\u2019 within the central part of the Midland \nValley terrane, which supplied material to the southerly derived Lower Devonian \nCrawton Group conglomerates of the Strathmore Basin in the northeast Midland \nValley, included a block of older (> 440 Ma) metamorphic rocks. Further evidence for \na Grenvillian basement to the Midland Valley terrane is provided by the presence of \nMesoproterozoic (906-1180 Ma, Davies et al. 1984; Halliday et al. 1984; Aftalion et \nal. 1984) upper amphibolite to granulite facies metamafite and garnet granulite\/quartz \ngranulite xenoliths of metasedimentary origin within the much younger, \nCarboniferous volcanic vents of the Midland Valley (see Upton et al. 1999). The \nolder Palaeoarchean, Neoarchaean and Palaeoproterozoic components are subordinate \nand variable in distribution within the Silurian sandstones and may well be recycled \nfrom the proposed Grenvillian basement. Some of these components are also \nindicated in the xenoliths from the Partan Craig vent in East Lothian, i.e. zircons with \nprimary ages of > 2.2 Ga and probably 2.7 to 2.8 Ga (Halliday et al. 1984).  \nThe Lower Palaeozoic (Cambrian to Ordovician) detrital zircon component \nwithin the sandstones was largely derived from a igneous\/volcanic source which \nincluded granitic, andesitic and felsitic rocks. Geochemical studies (Heinz & \nLoeschke 1988) indicate that the fine-grained volcanic to hypabyssal igneous rocks \nbelong to calc-alkaline to high-K suites, associated with a convergent plate margin, or \ncontinental area undergoing crustal extension. Detritus shed from this igneous source \nterrane forms a major component of the sandstones within the southern Midland \n 12\nValley (Table 2; also see Phillips et al. 2004). Granitic boulders, which have a \ncomparable age range (Rb-Sr age dates 470-560 Ma, Longman 1980; Longman et al. \n1979) to this Lower Palaeozoic component, occur within the northerly derived Benan \nand Kilranny conglomerate formations. These conglomerates also contain detritus \nderived from the Ballantrae ophiolitic complex (Bluck 1983). Although older than the \nCraigskelly Conglomerate Formation, these Ordovician conglomerates form part of \nthe same stratigraphical sequence and were, therefore, probably derived from the \nsame volcanic\/plutonic source. Sm-Nd isotopic provenance studies (Stone & Evans \n1995) have shown that the Craigskelly Conglomerate Formation possesses a much \nlower \u03b5Nd (-8.5) than the Kilranny Conglomerate (\u03b5Nd = +3.2). Stone & Evans \n(1995) suggested that the stripping of the Ballantrae ophiolite complex, progressively \nexposing the underlying basement, could explain this variation. However, the Lower \nPalaeozoic detrital zircon component in the Craigskelly Conglomerate Formation \nsandstone includes calc-alkaline intrusive\/volcanic rocks indicating that this simple \nunroofing model does not fully explain the observed variation in isotopic \ncomposition. \nThe age of the igneous component within the Silurian sandstones of the \nMidland Valley is significantly older than the depositional\/stratigraphical age of the \nhost sediments. This relationship does not fit with any model involving sediment \nbeing shed from a contemporaneous volcanic centre (i.e. the Midland Valley arc, \nBluck 1983; Bluck et al. 2006), but is more consistent with the reworking of a pre-\nexisting volcanic\/plutonic complex founded upon, or intruded into a Mesoproterozoic \n(Grenvillian) metamorphic basement. Such an interpretation is supported by the \npetrographic provenance study of Phillips et al. (2004) which demonstrated a recycled \norogenic provenance for the Silurian sandstones.  \nIndirect evidence suggests that the volcanic\/plutonic terrane may have been \nassociated with, or covered by a wacke sandstone-dominated sedimentary sequence \nthat also included minor shelf limestones. The south- to southeast-derived Siluro-\nDevonian Greywacke Conglomerate Formation of the southern Midland Valley \ncontains abundant pebbles and cobbles of wacke sandstone (McGiven 1967; Bluck \n1983, 1984; Smith 1995). These clasts are lithologically distinct from the Lower \nPalaeozoic strata of the Southern Uplands (Syba 1989; Stone & Evans 2001) and are \ngenerally thought to have been derived from within the Midland Valley terrane (Syba \n1989; Smith 1995; Phillips et al. 2004). Sparse limestone pebbles in these Siluro-\n 13\nDevonian conglomerates (Swanshaw Sandstone and Greywacke Conglomerate \nformations) contain Mid-Ordovician conodonts (Pygodus anserinus Biozone; \nArmstrong & Owen 2000; Smith 2000; Dean 2000). Similarly, rare limestone clasts \nwithin the Lower Devonian conglomerates (Crawton Group) of the northeast Midland \nValley contain early Ordovician silicified brachiopod and crinoid remains (Ingham et \nal. 1985), and probable mid-Ordovician conodonts (Armstrong & Owen 2000). \nPhillips et al. (2004) noted that the range of lithologies with an igneous, \nsedimentary and metamorphic provenance in the Silurian to Lower Devonian \nsedimentary sequences of the southern Midland Valley is remarkably similar to the \nrock assemblage present within the Tyrone Igneous Complex and its Ordovician \ncover (Cooper & Johnston 2004; Cooper & Mitchell 2004). This igneous complex lies \nwithin an extension of the Midland Valley terrane in Ireland (see Fig. 1) and \ncomprises: (a) an ophiolitic complex (the Tyrone Plutonic Group) composed mainly \nof gabbro and dolerite with minor basalt; and (b) an Arenig in age (c. 473 Ma, Cooper \net al. 2008) arc-related, volcanic suite (Tyrone Volcanic Group) which includes \nbasaltic pillow lavas, basic and intermediate tuffs and rhyolite (Hutton et al. 1985; \nCooper & Johnston 2004; Cooper et al. 2008). Recent studies show that the ophiolite \nwas obducted around c. 475 Ma, after which northward directed subduction and the \nvolcanic arc were established (Cooper et al. 2008; Chew et al. 2008). Arc-related \nintrusives, ranging in composition from tonalite, to diorite and granodiorite, through \nto granite, as well as their higher level intrusive equivalents, have yielded ages in the \nrange 473-464 Ma (U-Pb zircon, Hutton et al. 1985; Cooper et al. 2008). \nBiostratigraphical control on the age of the Tyrone Volcanic Group is limited to one \nstratigraphical horizon towards the top of the sequence on Slieve Gallion. Analysis of \nthe graptolite fauna allowed Cooper et al. (2008) to establish a tight correlation to the \nMiddle Arenig (late Castlemainian stage) for this part of the volcanic arc. Graptolite \nassemblages within the Balcreuchan Group of the Ballantrae Ophiolitic Complex on \nthe southern margin of the Midland Valley terrane indicate that it is has a wider age \nrange, from basal to upper Arenig (Stone & Rushton 1983). Cooper et al. (2008) \nnoted that the ophiolitic assemblage in the Ballantrae Complex includes serpentinised \nmantle rocks from deeper within the ophiolite sequence than the upper crustal \n(oceanic) gabbroic Tyrone Plutonic Group. It is likely, therefore, that the local \nBallantrae Complex was the source of serpentinite within the Craigskelly \nConglomerate Formation and the older Kirkland, Kilranny and Benan conglomeratic \n 14\nformations of the Girvan area. The age profile of the Lower Palaeozoic volcanic and \nplutonic components within the Craigskelly, Cock Rig, Parishholm and March Wood \nformation sandstones corresponds to the age of the Tyrone Volcanic Group \nsupporting the hypothesis that this arc-related suite is representative of the source \nterrane that supplied detritus to the Ordovician-Silurian sedimentary basins of the \nsouthern Midland Valley.  \nThe Tyrone Igneous Complex is believed to be faulted against and possibly \nthrust over the Tyrone Central Inlier (Corvanaghan Formation) which is composed of \na sequence of high-grade (garnet \u00b1 sillimanite) metasedimentary rocks similar to \nthose of the Moine Group present in the Northern Highlands terrane of Scotland \n(Cooper & Johnston 2004). A recent study of the metasedimentary rocks of the \nTyrone Central Inlier (below the Tyrone Igneous Complex) (Chew et al. 2008) dated \nleucosomes at 467+\/-12 Ma, and the main fabric biotite cooling age at 468+\/-1.4 Ma \nconfirming that the rocks were metamorphosed to sillimanite grade during the \nGrampian orogeny. These metamorphic rocks also yield Palaeoproterozoic Sm-Nd \nmodel ages and detrital zircons with populations at 1.05-1.2. 1.5, 1.8, 2.7 and 3.1 Ga. \nChew et al. (2008) noted that, besides the zircon population in the 1 to 1.8 Ga range, \nthe significant population between 2.5 and 2.7 Ga indicated that a correlation with \neither the Argyll Group or the Southern Highland Group of the Dalradian Supergroup \nwas most likely. They concluded that the Tyrone Central Inlier was a Laurentian \nmicrocontinent incorporated into an outboard volcanic arc terrane during the \nGrampian orogeny. This raises the possibility that the population of mainly 1 to 1.7 \nGa detrital zircons in the Midland Valley Silurian sandstones is from another \nbasement or microcontinental source with a Grenvillian signature, possibly even the \nMoine (Northern Highlands terrane) or Grampian Group (Grampian terrane) (Cawood \net al. 2007). \nThe age profiles of detrital zircon populations present in the Silurian \nsandstones of the southern Midland Valley do not fit with a simple model of \nunroofing of a pre-existing, Tyrone-like, complex. The age of the Lower Palaeozoic \ncomponent in the sandstones, in general, becomes progressively younger \nstratigraphically upward through the sequence (Fig. 6), with the nature of the profiles \nindicating that detritus was simultaneously being supplied from both the \nvolcanic\/plutonic complex and basement rocks. A regional correlation has previously \n 15\nbeen made between the Tyrone Igneous and Ballantrae complexes (see Cooper et al. \n2008 and references therein). Both of these complexes were accreted\/obducted onto \nthe SE-margin of the Laurentian continent during the Arenig, but occur on opposite \nsides of the Midland Valley terrane. If they originally formed part of the same arc-\nophiolite complex then it has been dismembered during the subsequent closure of the \nIapetus Ocean, probably as a result of oblique transpression focused along the \nsouthern margin of Laurentian (Soper et al. 1992). Williams & Harper (1988), Smith \n(1995) and Phillips et al. (1998) have all concluded that sinistral strike-slip controlled \nbasin development, sedimentary facies distribution and deformation along the \nsouthern side of the Midland Valley terrane from the Llandovery through to at least \nearly Devonian times. This prolonged period of strike-slip deformation would not \nonly have led to the dismemberment of the Tyrone Igneous and Ballantrae complexes, \nbut also the periodic uplift and erosion of different structural\/stratigraphic levels \nwithin this ophiolite\/arc-related assemblage. Sediment shed from these uplifted blocks \ncould have included all of the required mix of volcanic, plutonic and basement \nderived lithologies recognised within the sedimentary sequences of the southern \nMidland Valley. The remains of this dismembered volcanic\/plutonic source, apart \nfrom the Tyrone Igneous and Ballantrae complexes, are now hidden beneath the \nlocally thick lower to upper Palaeozoic cover sequence which blankets the Midland \nValley terrane. \n \nImplications for sediment dispersal patterns within \nthe Scottish sector of the Caledonian orogen \nIt is clear from the above discussion that the likely source of the Lower Palaeozoic \nsedimentary sequences preserved along the southern margin of the Midland Valley \nwas located within this elongate northeast\u2013southwest-trending terrane. Furthermore, \nthe absence of detritus derived from the Grampian terrane Dalradian Supergroup, \nsituated to the north, questions any model requiring sediment dispersal across the \nMidland Valley terrane to feed the Southern Uplands sedimentary basin. Tanner & \nSutherland (2007) have argued that the Highland Boundary Fault, which separates the \nGrampian and Midland Valley terranes, does not represent a major terrane boundary. \nConsequently, these two areas may have been in relatively close proximity during the \nLower Palaeozoic, requiring that any sediment supplied to the Southern Upland \n 16\nsedimentary basin from the Grampian terrane must have by-passed the Midland \nValley (Fig. 7).  \nThe northerly derived conglomerates and wacke sandstones within the \nOrdovician Northern Belt of the Southern Uplands terrane, contain granite clasts (c. \n470 Ma; Elders 1987; Bluck et al. 2006), detrital micas (40Ar-39Ar cooling ages in the \nrange 458-502 Ma; Kelley & Bluck 1989) and detrital garnet (Sm-Nd age c. 468 Ma; \nOliver et al. 2000) which suggest a source within the Laurentian continent (see Smith \net al. 2001; Phillips et al. 2003). The range of lithologies present within the \nconglomeratic rocks (e.g. Corsewall and Blackcraig conglomerates) of the Ordovician \nCorsewall and Marchburn formations of the Northern Belt of the Southern Uplands \nare similar to those found within the coarse clastic deposits in the Girvan area of the \nsouthern Midland Valley. This led Smith et al. (2001) to conclude that the source of \nthe northerly derived sediments within the Northern Belt lay within the Midland \nValley terrane, and included the Ballantrae and Tyrone Igneous complexes (Fig. 7). \nTransported fossils (e.g. Kilbuchophyllid corals) present within the Southern Uplands \nconglomerates (Kirkcolm Formation) are similar to the fauna present within the \nCaradocian mudstones and limestones of County Tyrone, Ireland (Bardahessiagh \nFormation, Pomeroy, Scrutton et al. 1998), providing further evidence that the \nMidland Valley terrane, at least intermittently, supplied material to the Southern \nUplands sedimentary basin (see Fig. 7). However, although the detrital zircon \npopulation within the sandstones of the Kirkcolm Formation includes a significant \nMesoproterozoic (peak at c. 1050 Ma) component, the formation is dominated by \nzircons derived from a Palaeoproterozoic (or older) source terrane. This does not fit \nwith the Midland Valley being the sole source for the Kirkcolm Formation, but \nindicates a significant input of detritus from Laurentia. Oliver et al. (2000) suggested \nthat metamorphic detritus (including garnet) within the sandstones of the Southern \nUplands was derived from the uplifted Grampian terrane (also see Hutchison & Oliver \n1998). The predominantly northeast to southwest palaeoflow direction established for \na large part of the wacke sandstone sequence in the Northern Belt (evidence \nsummarised in Smith et al. 2001) raises the possibility that any detritus derived from \nthe Grampian terrane may have by-passed the Midland Valley to the north, to be \ntransported axially along the Southern Upland sedimentary basin (Fig. 7). Work by \nPhillips et al. (2003) dating detrital zircons (U-Pb, 557 Ma, 613 Ma and 1043 Ma) \nfrom the southwest-derived Portpatrick Formation (Caradoc) was interpreted in terms \n 17\nof a provenance for relatively fresh arc-related volcanic detritus within an Avalonian \ncontinent fragment located near to the southern margin of Laurentia (Fig. 7).  \nIt is clear from the above that provenance and sediment dispersal patterns \nwithin the Scottish sector of the Caledonian orogen are far more complex than \npreviously thought. The broadly Arenig in age, obducted ophiolite, arc-related, \nvolcanic-plutonic complex and Mesoproterozoic basement which provided a major \nsource of detritus to Caradoc sedimentary basins in the Midland Valley and also \nprovided some detritus into the Southern Uplands basin, was located within the \nMidland Valley terrane. Evidence for Caradoc volcanism within the Midland Valley \nis lacking, questioning the reality of active arc-related volcanism within this terrane \nrelated to subduction and initiation of the Southern Uplands accretionary complex \n(McKerrow et al. 1977; Bluck et al. 1980; Leggett et al. 1982; Bluck 1983). The \npotential sedimentary links between the Midland Valley and Southern Uplands terrane \nhave implications for the magnitude of strike-slip displacement accommodated by the \nnortheast-trending, tract-bounding faults within the Northern Belt of the Southern \nUplands (see Fig. 7). The Southern Upland-Stinchar Valley Fault is widely considered \nto be a major terrane boundary separating the Midland Valley and Southern Upland \nterranes (e.g. Elders 1987). The presence of Midland Valley-derived detritus within \nthe Corsewall and Marchburn formations (Tappins Group, Smith et al. 2001) \nimmediately to the south of this fault system, indicates that the Midland Valley \nterrane and northern part of the Southern Upland terrane were in relatively close \nproximity during the early Caradoc. Consequently, the amount of sinistral strike-slip \nmovement accommodated by the Southern Upland-Stinchar Valley Fault system may \nhave been relatively small, possibly less than a hundred kilometres. The \u2018Midland \nValley influence\u2019 on the provenance of the Kirkcolm, Portpatrick and Shinnel \nformations decreases southward, away from this terrane, consistent with a more \n\u2018remote\u2019 site of deposition within the Southern Uplands sedimentary basin. The \npresent relatively close proximity of these sand-rich formations to the Midland Valley \nterrane, requires an increase in the amount of strike-slip displacement accommodated \nby other tract-bounding faults within the Northern Belt of the Southern Uplands (see \nFig. 7). The Leadhills and Fardingmullach faults represent major structures within the \nSouthern Uplands accretionary complex, and may, therefore, have accommodated a \nsignificant proportion of this movement. Further to the south, the Orlock Bridge Fault \nforms the boundary between the Northern (Ordovician) and Central (Silurian) belts of \n 18\nthe Southern Uplands terrane (Anderson & Oliver 1986; Phillips et al. 1995; Barnes et \nal. 1995). In southwest Scotland, this brittle fault is associated with an up to 5 km \nwide sinistral ductile shear zone, the Moniaive Shear Zone (Phillips et al. 1995), \nmovement along which occurred during the mid-Wenlock (Barnes et al. 1995; Smith \net al. 2001). Continued sinistral strike-slip deformation along the tract-bounding faults \nwould have resulted in the progressive \u2018telescoping\u2019 of the Southern Uplands \n(Ordovician) sedimentary basin, and its accretion onto the southern margin of the \nMidland Valley terrane. This progressive collapse of the basin is thought to have \noccurred in response to overall sinistral transpression focused along the southern \nmargin of the Laurentian continent (Barnes et al. 1995) during the final stages of \nIapetus Ocean closure.  \n \nConclusions \nSandstones from the Silurian sequences of the southern Midland Valley are \ncompositionally similar, similar in the age distribution of their detrital zircon \npopulations and were derived from a recycled orogenic provenance. Detrital zircon \npopulations within the sandstones, irrespective of stratigraphical age, are dominated \nby a younger, early Palaeozoic and an older predominantly Mesoproterozoic \ncomponent. The youngest early Palaeozoic zircons present become progressively \nyounger upward through the sequence, but is dominated by Arenig\/Llanvirn zircons \ndominate and are interpreted as having been derived from a pre-existing volcanic-\nplutonic-ophiolite source located within the Midland Valley. The younger zircons of \nLlanvirn to Llandovery age in the Hagshaw Hills, and Llandovery age in the Eastfield \ninlier are interpreted as indicative of penecontemporaneous, but less intense, \nmagmatic events associated with the development of strike-slip basins. The \nMesoproterozoic component within the sandstones has a dominant component at c. \n1000 Ma and is thought to represent metamorphic detritus shed from a Grenvillian \nbasement to the Midland Valley terrane.  \nNo evidence has been found to suggest that a Grampian metamorphic terrane \nsupplied sediment to the Ordovician-Silurian basins located along the southern margin \nof the Midland Valley: viz, there are no Archaean and c. 1.8 Ga \u2018spikes\u2019. This \nquestions any model requiring the transport of detritus across the Midland Valley, to \nbe deposited within the Southern Uplands sedimentary basin from Lower Llandovery \nto Wenlock times. The Arenig age obtained for a significant proportion of the Lower \n 19\nPalaeozoic detrital zircon population has led to the conclusion that an assemblage \nequivalent to the Ballantrae Complex and Tyrone Igneous Complex, and their \nassociated cover sequences, formed part of the source. The age profiles of detrital \nzircon populations, however, do not fit with a simple model of unroofing of such a \ncomplex, rather they point to the periodic uplift of fault-bound dismembered blocks \nduring a prolonged (Llandovery through to at least early Devonian) period of sinistral \nstrike-slip deformation which controlled basin development, sedimentary facies \ndistribution and deformation along the southern side of the Midland Valley terrane. \n \nAcknowledgements \nThis work forms part of the British Geological Survey\u2019s Geology and Landscape \nNorth Programme.

Data were collected using a single static acquisition with \nthe configuration shown in Table A1. Instrumental parameters are detailed in Table \nA2.  \nAblation was conducted using a Nu Wave Research UP193SS (193 nm), \nNd:YAG laser ablation system and an in-house designed low volume \u2018zircon ablation \ncell\u2019, based on the design of Bleiner & Gunther (2001). Samples were mounted in 25 \nmm epoxy resin discs and polished to reveal an equatorial section of the mineral \ngrains. Ablated sample material was transported from the laser cell into the MC-ICP-\nMS using a continuous flow of 400 ml\/min of He gas. \nThe MC-ICP-MS was tuned at the start of each analytical session using a 300 \nppt solution of Tl-235U  introduced via a Nu Instruments DSN-100 de-solvating \nnebuliser, using an ESI PFA-50 nebuliser tip. Ion counter (IC)-Faraday gains were \ndetermined for each of the three IC\u2019s using a weaker 50 ppt Tl-235U solution, jumping \nthe 205Tl peak through each IC, and comparing it to the equivalent Faraday signal. IC \ngains were of the order of 62, 72 and 79 % for IC0, IC1 and IC2 respectively, over the \neight analytical sessions. Repeat measurement of the gains showed that these values \nwere reproducible to within << 0.1 % (2SD) over an approximately 8 hour operating \nperiod. \nData were acquired using the Nu Instruments time resolved analysis (TRA) \nsoftware. An instrument zero and on-peak zero were measured at the start of each run, \neach for a total of 60 seconds. After completion of the baselines, the laser was fired \nand sample data were acquired for approximately 40 seconds per ablation for a run of \n10-15 (max 6) ablations. During the course of each acquisition the Tl-235U solution \nwas co-aspirated to allow for the measurement and correction of instrument induced \nmass bias and plasma induced elemental fractionation. 202Hg was measured \nsimultaneously, and used to correct for the isobaric interference of 204Hg on the 204Pb \npeak, (assuming 204Hg\/202Hg = 0.229887). \nThe laser sampling protocol employed varied, depending upon sample size. \nFor example, where samples were large enough, a dynamic sampling approach was \ntaken (30 x 30 \u00b5m raster, using a 25 \u00b5m spot and 15 \u00b5m raster spacing). However, for \nthe smaller grains found in some of the samples, a static sampling approach was taken \n 35\nusing a 35-50 \u00b5m ablation spot. In all cases, samples were normalised to the relevant \nstandard data \u2018like-for-like\u2019, according to spot size and fluence. \nThe internationally recognised 91500 zircon was used as a matrix matched \nstandard and analysed at regular intervals throughout each session. Data were \nnormalised according to the deviation of the average daily 207Pb\/206Pb and 206Pb\/238U \nvalues obtained for 91500. In the case of the latter, this is to correct for elemental \nfractionation in the plasma (dynamic ablation). Within-run laser-induced static \nelemental fractionation ablation is negligible due to ablation pit aspect ratios < 0.5. \nNormalisation of the 207Pb\/206Pb ratio of 91500 corrects for any drift, or offset, from \nthe gain value recorded previously for the ion-counters. Uncertainties for each ratio \nare propagated relative to the respective reproducibility of the standard, to take into \naccount the errors associated with the normalisation process and additionally to allow \nfor variations in reproducibility according to count rate of the less abundant 207Pb \npeak. \nAll data were processed using an in-house spreadsheet calculation routine and \nare tabulated in Table A3. Data recording < 0.01 mV 207Pb (i.e. below the detection \nlimit) have been rejected and those reporting > 300 cps 204Pb in the sample after \ncorrection for the isobaric interference of 204Hg have been assessed and corrected for \ncommon-Pb where required. All data are plotted on Tera-Wasserberg Concordia plots \n(Fig. 5). Frequency distribution plots (Fig. 6) have been generated on all data < 10% \ndiscordant. All quoted data point ages are 206Pb\/238U ages unless otherwise stated. \n \nTable A1.
