Introduction \nInnovations can spread and eventually pervade a language, they can fail to take \nhold, or they can remain, without ever affecting a large number of lexical items. \nExamples of the latter kind are interesting, because they provide us with insights \ninto why a linguistic system does not favour such innovations. The second \nlocative in Russian is such an example. It is well known that it arose as a result of \nthe restructuring of inflectional classes, in particular with the reinterpretation of \nthe original u-stem locative singular inflection, together with the parallel \ndevelopment of a stressed inflection in a small number of nouns which now \nbelong to the declension historically associated with the i-stems.2 However, there \nare two questions associated with its development and current state. The first, \nmore often posed, question relates to the factors which favoured its development. \nThe second, less often posed, question is why it failed to generalize. Contrary to \nsome assumptions, informants have little problem producing or accepting second \nlocative noun phrases containing an adjective, and it is easy to find examples of \nsuch constructions in a variety of texts. So the combinatory possibilities of the \nsecond locative are not limited to set phrases of the type preposition-noun, thereby \nraising the question why the second locative failed to generalize beyond a small \nsubset of nouns.  \nWe show that there are associations between frequency distributions and the \nuse of the second locative, but there are also factors associated with the second \nlocative which are not associated with high frequency alone. On this basis it could \n2 \nhave been expected to generalize to a larger number of nouns and beyond. \nHowever, we argue that the failure of the second locative to spread lies in the fact \nthat it could never be realized in adjectival paradigms. The problem is that \nadjectives, in contrast with nouns, would require two different type signatures, if \nthey were to realize the second locative case: number-case-subcase (nouns); \nnumber-case-gender (adjectives) or number-case-subcase (adjectives). Even if \nadjectival morphology could differentiate the two cases, it would be \nsystematically constrained from doing so. Consequently, the second locative is \nrelevant for case government by the preposition, but, because it can play no role \nin determining the form of the adjective, this remains the limit of its syntactic \nrelevance. \n2. Historical Development of the Second Locative \nThe historical origin of the Russian second locative is well known. In Old Russian \nthe locative singular of \u043e-stem nouns was -\u0463  and of u-stem nouns it was -\u0443 \n(Table 1). \n3 \nTable 1: The singular paradigm of \u043e-stems and u-stems in Old Russian (Matthews \n1960, 104 and 106) \nSG \u0441\u0442\u043e\u043b\u044a \n(\u043e-stem, masculine)\n\u043b\u0463\u0442\u043e \n(\u043e-stem, neuter) \n\u0441\u044b\u043d\u044a  \n(u-stem, masculine)\nNOMINATIVE\/ \nACCUSATIVE \n\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043b\u044a \u043b\u0463\u0442\u043e \u0441\u044b\u043d\u044a \nGENITIVE \u0441\u0442\u043e\u043b\u0430 \u043b\u0463\u0442\u0430 \u0441\u044b\u043d\u0443 \nDATIVE \u0441\u0442\u043e\u043b\u0443 \u043b\u0463\u0442\u0443 \u0441\u044b\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438 \nINSTRUMENTAL \u0441\u0442\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043c\u044c \u043b\u0463\u0442\u043e\u043c\u044c \u0441\u044b\u043d\u044a\u043c\u044c \nLOCATIVE \u0441\u0442\u043e\u043b\u0463  \u043b\u0463\u0442\u0463  \u0441\u044b\u043d\u0443 \nUnder the situation depicted in Table 1 there was no second locative case, because \nthe inflectional suffixes -\u0463 and \u2013\u0443 were inflectional variants of the locative case \nwith the same syntactic distribution. That is, they were used with the prepositions \n\u043f\u0440\u0438, \u0432\u044a, \u043d\u0430, \u043e and \u043f\u043e. As nouns which were originally u-stems migrated from the \nu-stem inflectional class to the \u043e-stem class, the u-stem endings were lost in \nRussian. The end result of these changes is that the nouns which were originally \nu-stems have now adopted the \u043e-stem locative singular inflection \u2013\u0435 (which \ndeveloped from -\u0463). However, as is well known, in a small group of nouns the \noriginal u-stem inflection \u2013\u0443 was maintained with a more restricted syntactic \ndistribution: it can only be used with the prepositions \u0432 and \u043d\u0430. For the very same \nnouns the inflection \u2013e is still used with the prepositions \u043f\u0440\u0438 and o. Hence, given \nthat there is a formal distinction in some subset of noun lexemes associated with a \n4 \ndifferent distribution, we should recognize this as a separate morphosyntactic \nfunction (Comrie 1991). This distribution therefore differs from that of the \nlocative singular inflectional allomorphs in Old Russian, and on this basis it can \nbe claimed that, for a small group of nouns, there is a second locative case in \nmodern Russian. We sum up this distribution in Table 2. \nTable 2: The distribution of the second locative \n MOST NOUNS A FEW NOUNS \n\u043f\u0440\u0438, \u043e Locative   Locative 1  \n\u0432, \u043d\u0430   Locative Locative 2  \n \nIf the evidence from texts is indicative, this new distribution, and therefore \nnew function, is not attested before the middle of the seventeenth century  \n(Unbegaun 1935, 105; \u0427\u0435\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0445 1953, 262; Stang 1952, 15; Kiparsky 1967, 36). \nThorndahl (1974: 918-9) in his large corpus study could find no evidence of \npreference among the prepositions \u0432\u044a, \u043d\u0430, \u043f\u0440\u0438 and \u043e for one inflection (-e\/\u0463 or -\u0443) \nover the other, and the last of his texts is dated 1649. However, by the middle of \nthe eighteenth century Lomonosov in his grammar (\u041b\u043e\u043c\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0432\u044a, \u00a7184) noted \nthat the change from -e to -\u0443 occurs most with the prepositions \u043d\u0430 and \u0432\u044a.  My \nanalysis of an anthology of eighteenth century Russian texts (Manning 1951) also \nindicates that the development of the second locative as a separate function must \nhave been near to complete by then, as no examples could be found of \nprepositions other than \u0432\u044a and \u043d\u0430 taking the ending \u2013\u0443. It is also worth noting that \nwhile Bulaxovskij (\u0411\u0443\u043b\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 1954, 62) says that the use of the \u2013\u0443 inflection \nwas more widespread at the beginning of the nineteenth century, he also indicates \n5 \nthat it was restricted to the prepositions \u0432 and \u043d\u0430, with its use at that time with the \npreposition \u043f\u0440\u0438 noted as \u2018rare\u2019, which also fits with the distribution in Table 2. \nAfter this brief explanation of the historical context we now turn to the current \nstatus of the second locative in modern Russian. \n3. The contemporary situation \nIn this section we examine the factors in the modern language which may support \nor hinder the use of the second locative. \n3.1 The second locative and syntax \n \nIf examples of the second locative with \u0432 and \u043d\u0430 could not occur in contexts with \na modifying adjective and were restricted to set collocations, it could be argued \nthat they are just idiosyncrasies which should be listed in the lexicon, and that \nthere is no need to consider the second locative a genuine case distinction. Franks \n(1995, 43 and 58 fn36), for instance, appears to rule out the use of the second \nlocative in modified NPs, except for set phrases and place names. However, it is \nnot difficult to find examples which contradict this claim. In (1) the noun in the \nsecond locative is being modified by the possessive \u043d\u0430\u0448. \n(1) \n \u0411\u044b\u043b\u0438 \u0434\u0432\u0430 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0430 \u0432  \u043d\u0430\u0448-\u0435\u043c  \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043a-\u0443. \n were  two  friends in  our-SG.LOC regiment-SG.LOC2 \n\u2018There were two friends in our regiment.\u2019 \n (Cited in \u0414\u043e\u043a\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430 1963, 120) \n6 \nFurthermore, modification of a noun in the second locative can be recursive, \nallowing for more than one adjective before the noun, as demonstrated by (2), \nwhich is taken from the novel \u2018\u041d\u0430\u0440\u043a\u043e\u0442\u0430\u2019 by V.P.

There are clear examples of preposition and noun in the \nsecond locative which are set collocations, but what examples (1)-(3) demonstrate \nis that it is not possible to view all instances of the second locative in this way. \nHence, the second locative has some relevance for syntax.  \n7 \n3.2 The second locative and frequency \n \nGiven that, at some level, the second locative has some relevance for syntax, it \ncan be understood as an example of overdifferentiation. That is, it is a \ngrammatical distinction which is made by a small number of lexical items. An \nextreme example of this is the verb be in English, which is the only verb to \ndistinguish first person singular (am) from the rest of the verbal paradigm.  In \ncomparison with this English example, the second locative fares slightly better in \nterms of the number of lexical items. Figures compiled from \u0417\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437\u043d\u044f\u043a (1977) \nindicate that there are 88 nouns which are supposed to have a compulsory second \nlocative in -\u0443\u0301, and there are about 20 nouns of class III (feminine nouns written \nwith a soft sign in the nominative singular) which have a second locative in -\u0438 \u0301.3 \nTable 3 gives figures for the number of nouns in \u0417\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437\u043d\u044f\u043a (1977) which are listed \nas having a second locative.  \nTable 3: Nouns with a second locative (based on \u0417\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437\u043d\u044f\u043a 1977) \n OBLIGATORY OPTIONAL TOTAL \nDecl.I (< masc \u043e-stem) 88 30 118 \nDecl. III (< fem i-stem) 20 6 26 \n \nIt is also worthwhile considering whether nouns with a second locative occur \namong the most frequent items. We extracted the 2000 most frequent noun \nlexemes from the pilot version of the Russian Standard Corpus (\u0421\u0438\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0432\u0430 2002; \nSharoff 2004), and found that they account for 82% of all noun tokens (131,939 \nout of a total 160,761 noun tokens). This same set of the 2000 most frequent \nnouns accounts for 93% of all occurrences of the second locative in the corpus \n8 \n(416 out of a total of 447 occurrences). This figure might suggest that it is the \nhigh frequency of items with a second locative which helps maintain its existence. \nHowever, the dative singular can be seen in a similar way, as the 2000 most \nfrequent nouns account for 90% of all occurrences of the dative singular in the \ncorpus (7984 out of a total of  8885 occurrences).  \nThere is a difference between nouns with a second locative and those \nwithout when we consider their frequency profiles in terms of locative contexts. \nBy locative contexts, we mean those syntactic contexts in which either a first \nlocative or a second locative could be used. Analysis of a dataset consisting of \nnouns which occur at least five times in the Uppsala corpus (\u041b\u0451\u043d\u043d\u0433\u0440\u0435\u043d 1993; \nMaier 1994) showed that nouns with a second locative occur significantly more \nfrequently in such contexts, in both the singular and the plural. For the singular \nthis is indicated in Figure 1. \n \nFigure 1: Histogram showing the percentage of lexemes without Loc2 (light) and \nwith Loc2 (dark) which occur one or more times in a locative context. \nloctot=12 \n9 \nIn Figure 1 lexemes without a second locative which occur at least once in \nlocative contexts (the light bars) all bunch toward the left of the histogram, the \ngreatest proportion of them occurring only once in such contexts. This group \ndrops quickly.  In contrast, lexemes with a second locative (the dark bars) stay on \na plateau up to loctot=12 (see Figure 1). This is highly significant (Mann-Whitney \nU test: p < 0.0001). In the plural (where there is no second locative form, of \ncourse) a similar effect is found, with nouns which have a second locative in the \nsingular still being more likely to occur in locative contexts. Again, the Mann-\nWhitney U test produces p < 0.0001 indicating that the shift in distribution is \nstatistically significant. Hence, there is some evidence to suggest that formal \ndifferentiation of the second locative occurs where lexemes tend to occur more \noften than is typical with prepositions which require a locative case (first or \nsecond). \n3.3 Properties of nouns with a second locative \n \nThere are a number of properties which are often associated with nouns which \nhave a second locative. As we shall see, the properties related to form are \ntypically associated with high frequency. On the other hand, it is reasonable to \nassume that the semantic property associated with the second locative is not \nconnected with high frequency.  \nThe first property is connected with the number of syllables in the stem. \n \nPROPERTY ONE \nA noun may have a second locative, if it has a monosyllabic stem. \n \n10 \nThis property includes nouns with metathesis or fleeting vowels, which from a \nmorphological perspective often behave as though they are functionally \nmonosyllabic. For instance, such nouns may belong to stress patterns which \notherwise occur only with monosyllabic nouns. There are exceptions to this \nproperty, for instance the noun \u0430\u044d\u0440\u043e\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442. Of the nouns listed in \u0417\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437\u043d\u044f\u043a (1977) \nas having a second locative only 10 are polysyllabic, if we exclude metathesis and \nfleeting vowels. Furthermore, the exceptions are either stump formations (such as \n\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043a), or formed using the complex suffix \u043f\u043e\u043b(\u0443)-, or diminutives. \nThe next property associated with items which have a second locative \nconcerns the last element of the stem.  \n \nPROPERTY TWO \nDeclension I nouns with a second locative end in functionally hard consonants.  \n \nIt is possible for the stem of a declension I noun with a second locative to end in \n\/j\/, but as A.A. Reformatskij (\u0420\u0435\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 1975, 85) pointed out, within any \nparadigm, the phoneme \/j\/ behaves like a hard consonant. For example, this is \nwhy nouns such as \u0433\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0439 have a genitive plural in -\u0435\u0432. Property two is noted by \nIlola and Mustajoki (1989, 42), who state that, \u201cMasculines which have a \nprepositional case ending -\u0443 (-\u044e) may end in any consonant except an obstruent \npalatal.\u201d  There do appear to be counterexamples to property two: the collocations \n\u0432\u043e \u0445\u043c\u0435\u043b\u044e \u2018drunk\u2019 (\u0417\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437\u043d\u044f\u043a 1977\u00b8 588) and \u043d\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043d\u044e, which typically has an \nadverbial function meaning, loosely, \u2018completely\u2019 or \u2018entirely\u2019.4 \nAnother, less strong, association is to be found between stress patterns and \nthe second locative.  \n11 \n \nPROPERTY THREE  \na) For declension I the second locative is often associated with stress pattern c.  \nb) For declension III the second locative is often associated with stress pattern e. \n \nStress pattern c involves stem stress in the singular, with the exception of the \nsecond locative, and ending stress in the plural. An example of this is the noun \n\u0441\u0430\u0434. Stress pattern e is the same as stress pattern c, except that the ending stress in \nthe plural is overridden in the nominative plural (and accusative plural of \ninanimate nouns). An example of this is the noun \u0442\u0435\u043d\u044c. Of the nouns listed in \n\u0417\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437\u043d\u044f\u043a (1977) with a second locative, 64% of declension I nouns have stress \npattern c, and 77% of declension III nouns have stress pattern e.  \nThe other property associated with the second locative contrasts with the \nothers in that it is a semantic property and it is exceptionless.  \n \nPROPERTY FOUR \nNouns with a second locative are all inanimate. \n \nThis generalization must be a result of the specialization  of the second locative as \nit developed from the original u-stem ending (i.e. the development of the \ndistribution in Table 2), because there had been examples of u-stem nouns which \nwere animate (for example, \u0441\u044b\u043d), and earlier in Novgorod-Pskov dialects, for \nexample, the u-stem inflection for the locative (and genitive) had actually spread \nfurther to some o-stems, including to animates (\u041a\u0440\u044b\u0441\u043a\u044c\u043a\u043e 1998, 84). At this \nearlier period, of course, we assume that the distribution in Table 2 had not \n12 \ndeveloped, and the animate example with the u-stem ending in \u041a\u0440\u044b\u0441\u043a\u044c\u043a\u043e (1998, \n84) occurs with the preposition \u043f\u0440\u0438, in fact. According to Grannes, forms in \u2013\u0443 \n(the u-stem inflection) were used with animates in the seventeenth century (see \n\u0413\u0440\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0435\u0441 (1974\/1998, 145) and references there). It bears reiteration that the \nexistence of the second locative is dependent on a difference in the distribution of \nthe inflection as in Table 2, and that whether the ending \u2013\u0443 is used with animates \nor not is a logically separate issue. But it does appear that the development of the \nnew distribution, and therefore a second locative case, occurs at about the same \ntime as the restriction of the \u2013\u0443 inflection to inanimates. \nProperties one, two and three are form-based properties, while property four \nis semantic. There is an additional consideration about how these two sets of \nproperties contrast, and that is based on frequency. It is well known that there is \nan association between the length of the word and frequency: short items are more \nfrequent (Zipf 1935, 20-48). Property one is therefore probably associated with \nhigh frequency. Property three is also associated with high frequency, as \nMustajoki (1981) has shown that mobile stress in Russian is related to frequency. \nThe status of properties two and four is different. Having a stem which ends in a \nhard (or functionally hard) stem is not a property which is restricted to high \nfrequency items.  Similarly, being inanimate is not a property which is only \nassociated with high frequency. \nWe have seen that there are two form-based properties associated with a \nlarge number of nouns which have a second locative and which have a clear \nassociation with high frequency: monosyllabicity and stress pattern. In contrast, \nthere are two other properties associated with nouns with a second locative which \nare  not associated with high frequency: a (functionally) hard final element of the \n13 \nstem and inanimacy. If a population of speakers acquiring Russian infers that \nbeing monosyllabic and having a particular (less common) stress pattern are key \nproperties associated with nouns which have a second locative, then we might \nexpect the number of lexical items with a second locative to remain limited, \nbecause these properties are associated with high frequency items (where there is \na limited number of lexemes which occur a large number of times). In contrast, if \nthe properties two and four are inferred to be key, then one might expect the \nsecond locative to generalize beyond lexical items that have the kind of frequency \nprofile for locative contexts as in Figure 1.  \nThe second locative is typically portrayed as declining in popularity from \none generation to the next. For instance, in \u041a\u0440\u044b\u0441\u0438\u043d (1974, 177) it is stated that \nthere is a tendency for speaker\u2019s age to influence the use of the second locative \nform - \u0443\u0301, with younger generations using it less. It should be noted, however, that \nthe youngest age group shows an increase in usage over the one immediately \npreceding it, although this does not reach the levels of the oldest group. In a \nsurvey of 53 native speakers Mavroulidou (2001, 75-6) found a similar trend, \nwhich, while it involved a decline from older to younger speakers, again did not \ninvolve a monotonic decrease of usage from one generation to the next, because \nthe youngest age group had a higher percentage of usage than the group above it. \nFrom this it appears that the conflicting associations with frequency of the \nproperties we have identified are reflected in the fact that a core group of lexical \nitems maintain a separate second locative form. While there are factors which \nmaintain this group, we need to consider why it is that the second locative cannot \ngeneralize as a case. \n14 \n3.4 The second locative as a sub-case \n  \nV.A.

Plungian equates this with localization markers \nfound in the Dagestanian languages. Localization markers are added to the local \ncase markers in these languages. Of course, the second locative in Russian differs \nfrom this strategy in that the form is limited to a small number of lexical items and \nin that the marking involves cumulative exponence. We believe that, in equating \nthe second locative with such marking, the key insight is that the second locative \nis a specialization of the prepositional or locative case. In a system where one \ntreats the values of case as atomic, this means that the second locative is not \nopposed to the first locative (or prepositional) but is instead a specialization and, \nas such, is not in direct paradigmatic opposition with the other cases. Under such \na view, the best term for it may be \u201csub-case\u201d. This would make it akin to sub-\ngenders (Vaillant 1958; Corbett 1991, 161-168), such as animacy, which in the \nsingular in Russian further specifies gender.  \nBeing further specializations of case distinctions, rather than equal in status, \nsub-cases will affect a minimal proportion of the nominal paradigm. \n \n15 \nMINIMAL PROPORTION \nSub-cases are limited to a minimal proportion of the nominal paradigm. \n \nGiven a two-valued number system, the proportion of the nominal paradigm \nwhich a case will account for will depend on the number of case values available. \nThe smaller the number of values, the greater the proportion. We take minimal \nproportion here to refer to the smallest possible proportion. This would be a case \nbeing limited to one number sub-paradigm. That means that, for Russian, only the \nsecond genitive and second locative fit this definition. It should be borne in mind \nthat the number of lexical items which realize a second locative is irrelevant for \nthis criterion. It could be true that all nouns had a separate second locative form, \nbut the second locative would still remain a sub-case, because its appearance is \nlimited to one number value. \nAnother potential characteristic of sub-cases is that they are \u201cnon-\nautonomous\u201d cases (\u0417\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437\u043d\u044f\u043a 1973\/2002, 636-40; Mel\u2019\u010duk 1986, 66; Blake 1994, \n23-5). For the same set of lexemes a non-autonomous case will share a form with \nanother case function. In other words, there will be case syncretism. If one took \ninto account only the affixal morphology it would appear that the second locative \nis non-autonomous (as is true for the second genitive), looking similar to the \ndative singular. However, in declension III the second locative is always \ndifferentiated from the genitive, dative and first locative in terms of stress, and in \ndeclension I those nouns with a second locative which have stress pattern c (the \nmajority) will also make a contrast between the dative singular (stem stressed) \nand the second locative form (ending stressed). But the second locative and \nsecond genitive are the only cases in the singular for which it is prosody which \n16 \nallows us to establish a unique inflection.5 Hence, sub-cases may typically be non-\nautonomous. \n \nNON-AUTONOMY \nSub-cases are typically non-autonomous in their realization. \n \nThe second locative fares less well in terms of non-autonomy than the second \ngenitive. When it comes to adjectival inflection, however, the second locative \ndoes follow this criterion, because there is no independent form for the second \nlocative in adjectival morphology. Yet as examples (1)-(3) demonstrate, it is \nperfectly possible to use a first locative form of the adjective with a noun in the \nsecond locative.6 So the second locative does not obey the \u201ccomplete marking \nrequirement\u201d (Moravcsik 1995, 474) that a case be marked on each constituent of \nthe NP, which the standard Russian cases obey. Although, for example, on \nadjectives and other agreement targets the feminine singular dative and first \nlocative are always syncretic, the dative and first locative are distinguished when \nthere is masculine or neuter agreement. In contrast, there is no unique second \nlocative form on adjectives for any gender. This suggests that the second locative, \nalthough syntactically relevant, has a qualitatively different status than the other \ncases. Because of this property of the second locative it is possible to analyze it as \na further specialization of the first locative, rather than a fully fledged case which \nis in paradigmatic opposition to the first locative. As we have seen, the second \nlocative is relevant for syntax, as it is possible for it to occur with a modifying \nadjective, but it is the fact that it is a further specialization which stops the second \n17 \nlocative from becoming more generally applicable, and, we argue, it can therefore \nonly remain on the margins of the Russian case system. \n3.5 Paradigm conflict and the second locative \n \nWe have argued that the second locative is a sub-case, and as such is not in direct \nparadigmatic opposition with the other cases, but is instead a further \nspecialization of the first locative. In this section we see what consequences this \nhas for the analysis of the second locative. We shall express the analysis using the \nNetwork Morphology framework (Corbett and Fraser 1993; Brown 1998), \nreferring only to those concepts which are key for our understanding of the second \nlocative. \nA core concept within Network Morphology is that of default inheritance. \nThis is illustrated in Figure 2. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2: Inheritance structure for Russian nouns \nFigure 2 is an inheritance hierarchy for Russian nouns.  The hierarchy contains \nnodes which are given conventional labels, such as MOR_NOUN, N_O, N_I, \nN_II, N_III and N_IV. It is possible to use any arbitrary label for these, such as \nMOR_NOUN \nN_0 N_II N_III\nN_I N_IV \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0430 \n\u0437\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d \u0434\u0435\u043b\u043e\n\u043a\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \n18 \nthe number 42, but the labels are chosen to give an indication of the kind of \ninformation stored at the nodes. For MOR_NOUN this is default information \nabout the morphology of nouns. N_I to N_IV contain information which would \ntraditionally be associated with noun declensions. Underneath the nodes N_I, \nN_II, N_III and N_IV are example lexical items. The nodes are locations for \ninformation about the paradigms of the nouns which inherit from the classes \ndescribed by the nodes. For instance, a noun connected to N_I will inherit all the \ninformation required to generate the full paradigm for every case and number \ncombination. There is no need, however, to be entertained by the controversies \nsurrounding the number of inflectional classes for Russian, because this is merely \nan artefact of where one looks in the hierarchy. The node N_O generalizes the \ninformation shared by N_I and N_IV (and so looking top down Russian has three \nclasses, but looking bottom up it has four). It is possible to override information. \nFor example, the information in (4), which we represent using the lexical \nknowledge representation language DATR (Evans and Gazdar 1996), is located at \nthe MOR_NOUN node in the hierarchy in Figure 2. \n   (4) <mor sg prep> == \u201c<stem>\u201d _e \nThe information in (4) is overridden by the node N_III (where the prepositional \nending is -\u0438). Here we have used the attribute prep, labelling the ordinary \nlocative case as prepositional. We will treat the second locative as an instance of \npath extension. We can illustrate path extension by making reference to the \ninformation in (4). The left-hand side in (4) is enclosed in angle brackets. This is \nthe path <mor sg prep> (standing for the morphology of the prepositional \n19 \nsingular). The path <mor sg prep> is an extension of three other paths, as \nillustrated in (5).  \n \n(5) <> \n <mor> \n <mor sg> \n <mor sg prep> \n \nThe first path in (5) is the empty path, of which all other paths are extensions. \nThen there is a path for morphology. This is then extended by a path for the \nmorphology of singular number. The prepositional case then extends this. As we \nhave argued, the prepositional case is opposed to the other cases paradigmatically. \nThe ordering of the features is important, because it is possible to infer the form \nfor a particular specification on the basis of the most specific path of which it is \nan extension. We treat the second locative as an extension of the path \n<mor sg prep> which takes the form <mor sg prep loc>.  \nIn adjectival paths, case and gender are ordered after number, and case is \nordered before gender. This is because gender distinctions are lost in the plural in \nRussian, suggesting that gender in Russian undergoes neutralization in plural \ncontexts. The loss of distinction between masculine and neuter in the oblique \ncases of adjectives suggests that gender is ordered after case.7 This means that the \ntwo paths associated with the first locative (prepositional) case for Russian are \n(6a) for the masculine and neuter and (6b) for the feminine forms. \n \n20 \n(6) a. <mor sg prep> \n      b. <mor sg prep fem> \n \nIn other words, Russian adjectives have a maximal morphological signature \nnumber-case-gender. The signature is also variable, because for the oblique cases \nthere is no need to specify masculine or neuter, as these are syncretic (i.e. realized \nby the same form). In the example paths in (6a) and (6b) we have specific \nnumber, case and gender values involved: singular, prepositional, feminine. These \nbelong to the features number, case and gender respectively. From looking \nelsewhere in the morphological system of Russian we know that it is possible for \nthe morphological signature within a particular word class to vary significantly. \nFor instance, if we contrast the present and past tenses of Russian, the \nmorphological signatures differ in a very important respect. \n \n(7) a. <mor non-past sg first> \nb. <mor past sg masc> \n \nIn (7a) and (7b) the type signatures for the verb differ: tense-number-person in  \n(7a) opposed to tense-number-gender in (7b). As is well known, this contrast in \nsignatures exists for all verbs in Russian. The split is between the non-past and the \npast tense. However, once we are dealing with the past there is no choice between \nperson or gender. Equally, in Polish where the additional clitic morphology of \nperson is added to the gender marked past tense, it is not possible to circumvent \nthe requirement to mark gender. In other words, we might posit the following \nconstraint on the structure of the paradigm: \n21 \n \n(8) Morphological Signature Constraint (Version 1) \n Given a specific value of a particular feature F, morphology does not \nexhibit a choice of realizing either values of feature X, or values of feature \nY. \nAs it stands (8) is too strong a constraint. For example, if we consider (7a) and \n(7b) the presence of the value sg does not prevent the choice of person in (7a) in \ncontrast to gender in (7b). Of course, we know that this choice is dependent on \ntense.  Instead, we redefine the Morphological Signature Constraint based on the \nnotions of path and extension in (4) and (5): \n \n(9) Morphological Signature Constraint (Version 2) \n If values Va and Vb belong to different features, then they cannot be \nextensions of the same (sub-)paths. \n \nIn (7a) and (7b) the values first and masc belong to different features, but they are \nnot extensions of the same (sub-)paths. In contrast, when we consider adjectives, \nthe barrier to the increased syntactic relevance of the second locative becomes \nclear. Given the two different paths for the prepositional case of adjectives in (6a) \nand (6b) the addition of the feature value loc would violate (9), because the \nvalue loc is a sub-case feature which shares the same (sub-)path with the value \nin (6b) fem, which is a gender feature. This means that adjectival morphology \ncannot innovate a separate realization for the second locative, because this would \ncreate a conflicting morphological signature. \n22 \n4. Conclusion \n \nThe Russian second locative represents something of a conundrum. It is an \ninnovation which never made great inroads into the language. However, it is \nassociated with some factors which are not limited by frequency. We have seen \nthat it can freely occur in modified noun phrases, thereby indicating that it is not \nrestricted to ossified set phrases. Its association with inanimacy is not a corollary \nof high frequency, and this naturally leads to the question why it did fail to spread \nbeyond a limited number of nouns which frequently occur in locative contexts. \nThe answer to this is that, although it may occur in modified noun phrases, the \nbasic design of the adjectival paradigm restricts its development there. The \nconsequences of this are that the rules of syntax do not need to ensure that the \nvalue associated with the second locative be propagated within the noun phrase. \nHence it remains restricted to rules concerning case government by the \nprepositions \u0432 and \u043d\u0430. The fate of the second locative provides an interesting \ncontrast with that other example of a sub-feature within Slavonic in general, and \nRussian in particular, namely the sub-gender of animacy, which fared so much \nbetter. \n \n23 \nNOTES \n*Surrey Morphology Group, CMC, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey GU2 7XH, UK. \nEmail: d.brown@surrey.ac.uk \n1 The research reported was supported by the Economic and Social Research Council (UK) under \ngrant number RES-000-23-0082 \u201cParadigms in Use\u201d.

In contrast, the actual inflections are given using \nCyrillic. Crucially, when the inflection \u2013\u0443 is given (in Cyrillic), this corresponds to the \nphonological representation \/u\/. While we cannot be sure about earlier stages of the language, \nwhen this inflection is discussed in relation to the contemporary language it can safely be assumed \nthat it is always stressed.  \n3 Work with informants indicates that intuitions differ regarding the two instances of class IV \nnouns which are supposed to have a second locative. These are \u0437\u0430\u0431\u044b\u0442\u044c\u0435 and its derivative \n\u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0437\u0430\u0431\u044b\u0442\u044ce. We therefore leave these out of consideration. \n4 I thank Tore Nesset and an anonymous referee for bringing these to my attention. \n5 In contrast, the nominative and accusative singular have a unique inflection for class II (a-stem \nnouns), and the genitive, dative, locative and instrumental singular have unique inflections for \nclasses I and IV (o-stem nouns). \n6 There does appear to be a difference between the second locative and the second genitive in \nterms of their behaviour with regard to adjectival modification.  In \u041f\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432 (1968, 190) Graudina, \n \n24 \n \nwho wrote the relevant section, discusses the use of adjectives in combination with a second \ngenitive.  In a survey people from four different age groups were asked, among other things, to \ngive the appropriate ending for the forms of the lexeme \u0447\u0430\u0439 in three different contexts.  Two of \nthese contexts were essentially contrasted by the presence or absence of a modifying adjective \nbefore a noun which one would expect to be in the genitive.  The relevant sentences are given in \n(a)-(b). \na.  \u041c\u044b \u0432\u044b\u043f\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0434\u0432\u0435 \u0447\u0430\u0448\u043a\u0438  \u0447\u0430... \n  we   drank  two  cups   tea.. \n   \nb.  \u042f \u0432\u044b\u043f\u0438\u043b \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043a\u0430\u043d \u043a\u0440\u0435\u043f\u043a-\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0447\u0430... \n  I    drank glass strong-SG.GEN tea... \n   \nA total of 4015 people were questioned.  Respondents were divided according to age group.  \nThere were five age groups, indicated in the table (\u041f\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432 1968, 189-190) by the period in which \nthey were born (1870-1909, 1910-1919, 1920-1929, 1930-1939, 1940-1949).  For each age group \nthere was less of a preference for the -\u0443 ending in (b) than in (a).  The difference is significant \n(\u041f\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432 1968, 192). \n7Underspecification alone is insufficient to account for all syncretisms in Russian.  For instance, \nBaerman et al (2005, 35) argue that, using underspecification alone, it is not possible to account \nfor the syncretism of dative, genitive and locative in feminine adjectives together with masculine \nand neuter syncretism.  \n REFERENCES \nBaerman, M., Brown, D.
