INTRODUCTION \nHE performances of high data rate systems are \nsignificantly limited by the multipath interference that \noccurs in the radio channel environment.  As an attractive \ntechnique in mitigating the multipath interference, Orthogonal \nFrequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) has been widely \napplied in various high data rate wireless Local Area \nNetworks (LAN) and broadcasting systems [1],[2]. \nFurthermore, it is also being considered in 3GPP Long Term \nEvolution (LTE) as an attractive multiple access technique in \nthe downlink [3].  \nDespite its competitive attributes, OFDM signals are \ncharacterized by very high Peak-to-Average Power Ratio \n(PAPR) levels and this can both degrade the link performance \nand also cause significant out-of-band interference products \nthat make it harder for the operator to comply with stringent \nspectral masks. The simplest solution to this problem is to \noperate the high power amplifier in the linear region by \nallowing a large enough amplifier back-off. However, this \napproach degrades the power efficiency of the system and \noften leads to unacceptable cost-efficiency conditions in the \n \n \noverall system [2]. \n Based on this background, reducing the PAPR of OFDM \nsignals is increasingly being considered to be very important \nin maintaining the cost-effectivess advantages of OFDM in \npractical systems, especially as new systems are being \nspecified with large number of sub-carriers. Up to date, there \nhave been proposed various PAPR reduction techniques such \nas Clipping method, Block Coding method, Selective Mapping \n(SLM) method, Partial Transmit Sequence (PTS) method, and \nTone Reservation (TR) method [2]. According to [2], Clipping \nmethod does not offer an attractive solution, because it leads \nto out-of-band distortion. Furthermore, the block coding \nmethod is not popular since it works on the trade-off between \nthe PAPR performance and bandwidth efficiency.  On the \nother hand, the SLM and PTS methods reduce the PAPR by \ncontrolling the phase of the data sub-carriers, which provides \nan effective solution. However they are computationally \nexpensive and also require transmitting continuous side \ninformation to the receiver, which degrades the capacity of the \nsystem. The overall BER performance may also be degraded if \nthere are errors in the side information [2]. In more detail, the \nTR technique was proposed by Tellado [4], whereby a small \nnumber of sub-carriers are reserved to create a cancellation \nsignal in the time domain, which can cancel the high peaks in \nthe information carrying signals at the transmitter. The \ncancellation signals can be easily discarded at the receiver \nafter the FFT processing. In this way, the technique can reduce \nPAPR of the OFDM signal without introducing additional \ndistortions to the information content and does not require side \ninformation to be sent to the receiver.  However, the TR \nalgorithms available, so far, in the literature leads to high \ncomputational complexity when the spectral constraints are to \nbe incorporated, for example the active-set approach proposed \nin [5].  \nIn this paper, we propose a gradient-based TR algorithm for \ncreating the peak-cancelling signal in the time domain by \nutilizing the reserved sub-carriers. Furthermore, the proposed \nalgorithm solves in an efficient manner the problem in \nimposing the spectral constraints on the peak-cancelling \nsignal; the spectral constraint is employed directly in the \nfrequency domain and thereby, leads to a tremendous \nreduction in the complexity. The proposed algorithm is then \ncombined with the DFT spreading technique proposed in [6], \nin order to further reduce the PAPR. Investigating the \ncombination of the two PAPR reduction techniques is \nA Gradient Based Algorithm for PAPR \nReduction of OFDM using Tone Reservation \nTechnique \nS. Janaaththanan, C.

In Section III, we present the simulation results for \nboth for the proposed algorithm and also for the combined \nscheme.

Finally, the conclusion is given in Section IV. \nII. SYSTEM MODEL \nIn this section, we first briefly review the basic of the \nOFDM transmitter and the PAPR definition. Moreover, a brief \nstep-by-step derivation of the proposed gradient based \nalgorithm is also exposed.  \nA. OFDM and PAPR \nThe OFDM signal is the sum of many orthogonally \noverlapped sub-channels of equal bandwidth. In order to \nrealize these spectrally overlapping sub-channels, the Inverse \nFast Fourier Transform (IFFT) is employed at the OFDM \ntransmitter.  The base-band samples for OFDM symbol, with \n\u0730 sub-carriers, at the output of IFFT (Inverse Fast Fourier \nTransform) output is given by [1], [2]: \n  \u0754\u0be1 \u0d4c \u0b35\u221a\u0bc7 \u2211 \u073a\u0bde\u0741\u0bdd\u0b36\u0c17\u0be1\u0bde \u0bc7\n\u2044\u0bc7\u0b3f\u0b35\u0b34   (1)  \nWhere \u074a\u0d4c0,1, \u2026 \u2026 . . , \u0730 \u0d46 1  and \u073a\u0bde denotes the data \nsymbol at the kth sub-carrier. \n \nThe Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) of a signal is \ndefined as [1]: \n \u0732\u0723\u0732\u0734 \u0d4c \u0749\u073d\u0754\u0be5\u05d0\u0be1|\u0754\u0be5|\n\u0b36\n\u0727\u123e|\u0754\u0be1|\u0b36\u123f  \n(2)  \nWhere \u0727\u123e|\u0754\u0be1|\u0b36\u123f is the expectation value, represents the \naverage power of the signal. \nSince Nyquist-rate samples might not reveal the peaks of \nthe continuous-time signal, it is desirable to show PAPR \nperformance on over-sampled discrete-time signals [2]. It is \ntypical to use an over-sampling rate of \u072e \u0d52 4 so that the PAPR \nbefore the digital-to-analog (D\/A) conversion can accurately \ndescribe the PAPR after the D\/A conversion [4].This \noversampling is done by simply performing the IFFT to the \nfrequency domain symbol vector, \u0706, formed by concatenating \n\u0730\u123a\u072e \u0d46 1\u123b zeros to the original frequency domain vector [2]: \n\u0706 \u0d4c \u0d63\u073a\u0b34, \u0b35\u073a, \u2026 \u2026 , \u073a\u0bc7 \u0b36\u2044 \u0b3f\u0b35, 0, \u2026 \u2026 . .0, \u073a\u0bc7\/\u0b36, \u2026 \u2026 , \u073a\u0bc7\u0b3f\u0b35\u0d67 \nAnd the resulting time domain samples are: \n   \u0720 \u0d4c \u06ff\u0706  (3)  \n \nWhere \u06ff \u0d4c \u123e\u087d\u0892\u0893\u123f\u087a\u0878\u0d48\u087a\u0878 is the IFFT matrix with \u087d\u0892\u0893 \u0d4c\n\u0ada\n\u221a\u087a\u0878 \u088b\u0890\u0adb\u08ca\u123a\u0892\u0b3f\u0ada\u123b\u123a\u0893\u0b3f\u0ada\u123b, \u0748 \u0d4c 1,2, \u2026 , \u0730\u072e and \u0749 \u0d4c 1,2, \u2026 \u2026 . . , \u0730\u072e. \nB. Proposed Low Complexity Gradient Based Algorithm for \nTR technique \nIf we assume that \u0738 tones are assigned to \u0738 sub-carriers \nwith indexes \u123c\u0748\u0b35, \u0748\u0b36, \u2026 . . , \u0748\u0bcf\u123d in the OFDM transmitter (before \nover-sampling), equation (3) can be decomposed into (4): \n \u0720 \u0d4c \u0703\u0ac9 \u0d45 \u0705\u0707  (4)  \nWhere \u0ac9 is a vector representing the tones to be used for \nPAPR reduction, \u0703 is the matrix with corresponding columns \nof \u06ff and \u0707 is the vector with information symbols and \u0705 is \nthe matrix with corresponding columns of \u06ff. This can be \nfurther simplified into: \n  \u0720 \u0d4c \u0703\u0ac9 \u0d45 \u0721,     where \u0721 \u0d4c \u0705\u0707  (5)  \nAs common to all PAPR reduction schemes, our task now is \nto reduce the cost function: \n  J\u0bb6 \u0d4c \u0521\u0720\u0521\u0bb6 \u0d4c \u0521\u0703\u0ac9 \u0d45 \u0721\u0521\u0bb6  (6)  \nThis is an infinity-norm minimization problem. This \ninfinite-norm function in (6) is a non-smooth function and \nfinding the exact solution is a tedious task. Therefore, we take \nan approximated approach based on the p-norm approximation \nfor infinite-norm, given by [8]: \n  J\u0b6e \u0d4c lim\u0b6e\u055c\u0bb6\u0521\u0720\u0521\u0b6e     (7)  \nAccording to [7], this p-norm function can be shown as a \nconvex function for any value of p. Therefore, the task now is \nto find the gradient of this p-norm function and then deduce \nthe gradient of the infinite-norm as p tends to infinity. \n \u0baaJ\u0c66\n\u0baa\u0ba1 \u0d4c \u0d6bJ\u0b6e\u0d6f\n\u0b35\u0b3f\u0b6e \u2211 |x\u0b70|\u0b6eU\u0b70,:x\u0b70LV\u0b70\u0b40\u0b35    (8)  \nWhen p \u055c \u221e, equation (8) becomes [8]: \n \u07f2J\u0bb6\n\u07f2\u0ac9 \u0d4e |\u0754\u0bd5|\n\u0b3f\u0b35\u0703\u0bd5,:\u0754\u0bd5 (9)  \nWhere the subscript b represents the index of the maximum \nmagnitude of the output sample. \nUsing this gradient, we formulate a simple gradient based \nalgorithm with the step size parameters as: \n \u07e4\u0bdc\u0be7\u0bd8\u0be5 \u0d4c\n\u07d9\n\u0745\u0750\u0741\u074e (10)  \nWhere \u07d9 \u0d4c 0.3,  found using the trial and error method and \n\u0745\u0750\u0741\u074e denotes the number iterations. A step size selection \nsimilar to (10) was considered in [7].  \nThe gradient based equation for updating the reserved pilots \nbecomes [9]: \n \u0ac9\u0b67 \u0d4c \u0ac9\u0b67\u0b3f\u0b35 \u0d46 \u07e4\u0bdc|\u0754\u0bd5|\u0b3f\u0b35\u0703\u0bd5,:\u0754\u0bd5 (11)  \nSince this update rule is performed in the frequency \ndomain, this algorithm can simply incorporate the necessary \nspectral constraint, by simply limiting the power amplitude or \npower of the pilot tones. As a result, after the update given by \n2978\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on May 26,2010 at 15:10:46 UTC from IEEE Xplore.

This projection operation is consistent with \nthe Gradient Projection method [11] for minimizing functions \nover convex sets. \nIII.

All the simulations were \ncarried out for 105  OFDM blocks. The corresponding \nsimulation parameters are given in Table 1. All performances \nwere evaluated based on the Complementary Cumulative \nDistribution Function (CCDF), which will give the probability \nthat the \u0732\u0723\u0732\u0734 is higher than a value, \u0732\u0723\u0732\u0734\u0b34.  \n \n \n \n \nFig. 1.  PAPR Reduction Performance of OFDM for different pilot \nlocations- TR technique only. \n \nFigure 1 shows the simulations results with the proposed \nalgorithm for different pilot locations. It is observed that the \nTR technique can achieve better results that the DFT \nspreading technique proposed in [6]. However, its \nperformance appears to be dependent on the pilot \narrangement. \nNotably, TR technique needs to sacrifice a small fraction of \nthe bandwidth for PAPR reduction purpose and thus, leads to \nnegligible data rate loss. However, for a system which does \nnot need to cope with bandwidth scarification, the proposed \nalgorithm can be, without further modification, easily \nincorporated to the technique proposed in [10]. In which, the \ndesigned peak-cancelling signal is employed in the null-\nsubcarriers in the OFDM systems; therefore, it is called as \nDummy Sequence Insertion (DSI) method. Figure 2 explains a \ntypical example of the OFDM symbol and pilot arrangement \nused in such technique.  In the DSI technique, unlike PTS and \nSLM method, the phases of the dummy sub-carriers are \ncontrolled to reduce the PAPR of the OFDM signal. Hence, \nthe transmitter needs not to be communicated with the receiver \nfor side information. \n \n \n \n \nFig. 2.

Restrictions apply. \n Moreover, the TR method (or DSI method) can simply be \ncombined with other PAPR reduction techniques to reduce the \nfurther PAPR in the OFDM signal. Figure 3 shows a possible \ncombination of the TR method with the DFT spreading \ntechnique proposed in [6].  \nFigure 4 shows the performance of the combined TR and \nDFT spreading schemes for different pilot locations. The best \nperformance was obtained when the pilots are suffixed to the \ndata. However, similar performance can be asymptotically \nachieved with the pilot location chosen using trial and error \nmethod. In both cases, equally spaced pilot locations are not \npreferred over the other two pilot arrangements. \n \n \nFig. 5.  PAPR Reduction Performance of OFDM for different pilot \nlocations- constraints applied. \n \nFigure 5 shows similar simulation results as Figure 1 and \nFigure 4, but using the restrictive spectral constraints, equal to \nthe average power mask for the data tones, in the frequency \ndomain as given by the projection rule in equation (12).  It is \nobserved that introducing spectral constraints into the \nproposed algorithm significantly affects the achievable PAPR \nreduction, except for the case when the pilot tones are suffixed \nwith the data block similar to Figure 2; where only a \nnegligible reduction in the achievable PAPR reduction. \nHowever, the performance is mostly affected when the pilots \nare located randomly according to the position 3.   \n \nIV. CONCLUSION \nIn this paper, we proposed a novel gradient based approach \nfor PAPR reduction using Tone Reservation technique. We \nshowed that proposed algorithm performs better than the DFT \nspreading technique proposed in [6]. However, the \nperformance depends on the pilot locations.  \nWe also showed the combined scheme (DFT \nspreading+TR) performance much better than the both \ntechniques, providing double the performances achieved using \nthe single technique.  \n From the extended investigation using the spectral \nconstraints, we showed that introducing constraints into the \nproposed algorithm affects the achievable PAPR reduction in \nall the cases. However, there is only a negligible reduction on \nthe achievable PAPR reduction when the pilots are suffixed \nwith the data (position 2) in the combined schemes.  \nSince 3GPP has recently launched a study item called 3GPP \nLTE (Long Time Evolution). In which, SC-FDMA is \nconsidered as the uplink candidate which uses DFT spreading \nto reduce the PAPR. Therefore, this combined scheme is also \nappropriate in that type of systems. \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nThe authors would like to acknowledge the European \nSatellite Network of Excellence (SatNEx2) for funding this \nwork. \nREFERENCES \n[1] R.
