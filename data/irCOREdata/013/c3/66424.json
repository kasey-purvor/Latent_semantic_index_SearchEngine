For the\nmissing-mass approach to be able to identify the Higgs boson, it will be necessary to use\na central jet detector and to tag b quark jets. The signal is predicted to be very small\nat the Tevatron, but observable at the LHC. However we note that the background, that\nis double-diffractive dijet production, may serve as a unique gluon factory. We also give\nestimates for the double-diffractive production of \u03c7c and \u03c7b mesons at the Tevatron. We\nemphasize that a high-resolution missing-mass measurement, on its own, is insufficient to\nidentify rare processes.\n1 Introduction\n\u00bfFrom several points of view it looks appealing to study processes with two large rapidity gaps\nin high energy hadron collisions. Applications of such processes, generated, for example, by\n\u2018Pomeron-Pomeron\u2019 collisions, embrace both searches for New Physics (such as the Higgs boson)\nand dedicated analyses of conventional physics, including the investigation of subtle aspects of\nQCD. The attractiveness of the approach is motivated by the spectacularly clean experimental\nsignatures and the possibility to clearly differentiate between different production mechanisms.\nEvents with large rapidity gaps may be selected either by using a calorimeter or by detecting\nleading protons with beam momentum fractions x close to 1. If the momenta of the leading\nprotons can be measured with very high accuracy then a particle (or system) produced by the\ndouble-diffractive mechanism may be observed as a peak in the spectrum of the missing-mass\n(M) distribution. Indeed, it has recently been proposed to search for the Higgs boson1 by\nmeasuring the outgoing fast proton and antiproton in Run II of the Tevatron with extremely\ngood precision corresponding to a missing-mass resolution \u2206M \u2243 250 MeV [2]. To ascertain\nwhether the sought after Higgs signal can be seen, it is crucial to evaluate the background.\nRecall that the inclusive search for an intermediate mass Higgs, that is pp or pp\u00af \u2192 HX\nwith H \u2192 bb\u00af, has an extremely small signal-to-background ratio, which makes this process\nimpossible to observe.\nIn Section 2 we briefly recall the QCD mechanism for the double-diffractive production of a\nsystem of large invariant mass M . We use this formalism in Section 3 to study the background\nfor double-diffractive H \u2192 bb\u00af production, and to show that the signal-to-background ratio can\nbe estimated in a practically model-independent way. Then in Section 4 we discuss double-\ndiffractive production of \u03c7b (and \u03c7c) mesons. We present their expected cross sections at the\nTevatron. In Section 5 we discuss another attractive possibility. That is, to use the double-\ndiffractive production of a dijet system as a \u201cgluon factory\u201d, which generates huge numbers\nof essentially pure gluon jets in a clean environment. In Section 6 we emphasize that a high-\nresolution missing-mass measurement on its own may not yield a sharp peak for a rare process, if\ncare is not taken to account for QED radiation. Finally, in Section 7, we present our conclusions.\n2 The mechanism for double-diffractive production\nWe wish to estimate the cross section for high energy reactions of the type\npp \u2192 p + M + p, (1)\nand similarly for pp\u00af, where the \u2018plus\u2019 signs indicate the presence of large rapidity gaps. To\nbe precise, we calculate the rate for the double-diffractive exclusive production of a system of\n1The possibility of a high resolution missing-mass search for the Higgs boson in exclusive double rapidity\ngap events was considered in Ref. [1].\n1\nlarge invariant mass M , for example, a Higgs boson. In all models [3]\u2013[8] the amplitude for\nthe double-diffractive process is described by Fig. 1, where the hard subprocess gg \u2192 M is\ninitiated by gluon-gluon fusion and the second t-channel gluon is needed to screen the colour\nflow across the rapidity gap intervals. In other words the Pomeron is modelled by two-gluon\nexchange.\nOne major difference between the various theoretical approaches concerns the specification\nof the exchange gluons. Either non-perturbative gluons are used in which the propagator is\nmodified so as to reproduce the total cross section [4, 6], or a perturbative QCD estimate is\nmade [8] using an unintegrated, skewed gluon density that is determined from conventional\ngluons obtained in global parton analyses. However it has been emphasized [9] (see also [5, 8])\nthat the non- perturbative normalisation based on the value of the elastic or total cross section\nfixes the diagonal gluon density at x\u02c6 \u223c \u2113T\/\n\u221a\ns where the transverse momentum \u2113T is small,\nnamely \u2113T < 1 GeV. Thus the value of x\u02c6 is even smaller than\nx\u2032 \u2248 QT\u221a\ns\n\u226a x \u2248 M\u221a\ns\n, (2)\nwhere the variables are defined in Fig. 1. However, the gluon density grows as x \u2192 0 and so\nthe use of a non-perturbative normalisation will lead to an overestimation of double-diffractive\ncross sections.\nOf course the fusion of the two energetic gluons into the high mass state in Fig. 1 is generally\naccompanied by the emission of soft gluons which may populate the rapidity gaps. The basic\nmechanism to suppress this effect is shown in Fig. 1, where the second t-channel gluon, which\nscreens the colour, does not couple to the produced state of mass M and has typical values\nof QT which are much smaller than M but yet are large enough (for sufficiently large M) to\nscreen soft gluon emission and to justify the applicability of perturbative QCD.\nRecently the p(p\u00af ) \u2192 p+H+ (p\u00af ) cross section has been calculated to single log accuracy [8].\nThe amplitude is\nM = A\u03c03\n\u222b\nd2QT\nQ4T\nfg(x1, x\n\u2032\n1, Q\n2\nT ,M\n2\nH\/4) fg(x2, x\n\u2032\n2, Q\n2\nT ,M\n2\nH\/4), (3)\nwhere the gg \u2192 H vertex factor A2 is given by (7) below, and the unintegrated gluon densities\nare related to the conventional distributions by\nfg(x, x\n\u2032, Q2T ,M\n2\nH\/4) = Rg\n\u2202\n\u2202 lnQ2T\n[\u221a\nT (QT ,MH\/2) xg(x,Q\n2\nT )\n]\n. (4)\nThe factor Rg is the ratio of the skewed x\n\u2032 \u226a x integrated gluon distribution to the conventional\none. Rg \u2243 1.2(1.4) at LHC (Tevatron) energies. The bremsstrahlung survival probability T 2 is\ngiven by\nT (QT , \u00b5) = exp\n(\n\u2212\n\u222b \u00b52\nQ2\nT\ndk2T\nk2T\n\u03b1S(k\n2\nT )\n2\u03c0\n\u222b 1\u2212kT \/\u00b5\n0\ndz\n[\nz Pgg(z) +\n\u2211\nq\nPqg(z)\n])\n, (5)\n2\nand strongly suppresses the infrared contribution to the QT integration of (3). The factor\n\u221a\nT\narises in (4) because the survival probability is only relevant to the hard gluon exchanges in\nFig. 1. In addition to this suppression due to the probability \u201cT 2\u201d that the pp \u2192 p + H + p\nrapidity gaps survive population by extra gluons from the hard process, we must also include\nthe probability S2 that the gaps are not filled by secondaries produced in soft rescattering\nbetween the protons, that is by an underlying interaction. We estimate the pp\u00af \u2192 p + H + p\u00af\nevent rate at the Tevatron in Section 3.3.\n3 Dijet background to double-diffractive Higgs produc-\ntion\nTo use the \u2018missing-mass\u2019 method to search for an intermediate mass Higgs boson, via the\nH \u2192 bb\u00af decay mode, we have to estimate the QCD background which arises from the production\nof a pair of jets with invariant mass about MH . If we assume that the Higgs boson is produced\nby the gg \u2192 H fusion mechanism then the signal-to-background ratio is just given by the ratio\nof the appropriate matrix elements squared for the gg \u2192 H and gg \u2192 dijet subprocesses.\n3.1 Gluon dijet background\nWe begin by considering the double-diffractive colour-singlet production of a pair of high ET\ngluons with rapidities \u03b71 and \u03b72. The gg \u2192 gg subprocess cross section is [3, 10]\nd\u03c3\u02c6\nd2pT\n=\n9\u03b12S\n4p4T\n1\n2p2T sinh \u2206\u03b7\ndM2\nd(\u2206\u03b7)\n(6)\n=\n9\u03b12S\n8p6T\n(\nM4\n4p4T\n\u2212 M\n2\np2T\n)\n\u2212\n1\n2 dM2\nd(\u2206\u03b7)\n,\nwhere M is the invariant mass of the dijet system, pT is the transverse momentum of the jets,\nand \u2206\u03b7 = |\u03b71 \u2212 \u03b72| is the jet rapidity difference. Note that, since the outgoing proton and\nantiproton are at small angles relevant to the respective beams, p1T = \u2212p2T .\nThe background (6) should be compared to the double-diffractive gg \u2192 H signal\nA2\n4\n=\n\u221a\n2\n4\nGF \u03b1\n2\nS\nN\n9\u03c02\n\u2243\n\u221a\n2\n36\u03c02\nGF \u03b1\n2\nS, (7)\nwhere GF is the Fermi coupling and N \u2243 1 since we assumeMH lies well below the tt\u00af threshold.\nHere we use the framework and the notation of Refs. [5, 3]2.\n2To be specific the signal-to-background ratio is given by comparing eqs. (8,10) of [5] with eqs. (8,17,19) of\n[3].\n3\nImmediately we see a problem. The small pT divergence of the dijet cross section, (6), means\nthat the background will be huge if just a missing-mass measurement on its own is performed.\nWe thus also require a central detector to impose a jet pT (or ET ) cut. With such an additional\ndetector we may select events with jets, say, with E2T > (3\/16)M\n2\nH . In other words we trigger on\ndouble-diffractive events containing a pair of jets with angles \u03b8 > 60\u25e6 from the beam direction\nin the Higgs rest frame. For a scalar Higgs boson this cut kills one half of the events, whereas\nthe dijet cross section (6) is reduced to\nd\u03c3\u02c6\ndM2\n=\n9\u03b12S\n8\n\u222b M2\/4\n3M2\/16\ndp2T\np6T\n(\nM4\n4p4T\n\u2212 M\n2\np2T\n)\n\u2212\n1\n2\n= 9.73\n9\u03b12S\n8M4\n. (8)\nWith the same scale in the couplings \u03b1S in (7) and (8), and neglecting the NLO corrections\n3,\nwe obtain the signal-to-background ratio\nS\nBgg\n=\n\u221a\n2GF\n9.73(81\u03c02)\nM3\n\u2206M\n1\n2\nBr(H \u2192 bb\u00af)\n(9)\n\u2243 (4.3\u00d7 10\u22123) Br(H \u2192 bb\u00af)\n(\nM\n100 GeV\n)3 (250 MeV\n\u2206M\n)\n.\nThe factor 1\n2\nBr(H \u2192 bb\u00af) accounts for the branching ratio of the H \u2192 bb\u00af decay and the \u03b8 > 60\u25e6\ncut of the low pT jets. (The H \u2192 bb\u00af branching ratio is about 0.7 if MH = 120 GeV.)\nThe ratio S\/Bgg \u223c 5 \u00d7 10\u22123 appears too small for the above approach to provide a viable\nsignal for the Higgs boson. However the situation is greatly improved if we are able to identify\nthe b and b\u00af jets. If we assume that there is only a 1% chance to misidentify a gluon jet as a b\njet, then tagging both b and b\u00af will suppress the gluon background by 104. In this case only the\ntrue bb\u00af background will pose a problem.\n3.2 Signal-to-background ratio for b quark dijets\nFor the double-diffractive central production of a bb\u00af pair, the H \u2192 bb\u00af signal\/bb\u00af background\nratio is much larger than that of Section 3.1. Here the ratio is strongly enhanced due to the\ncolour factors, gluon polarisation selection and the spin 1\n2\nnature of the quarks. First, the cross\nsections for inclusive colour-singlet dijet production are [3]\nd\u03c3\u02c6\ndt\u02c6\n(gg \u2192 gg) = 9\u03c0\u03b1\n2\nS\n2p4T\n(\n1 \u2212 p\n2\nT\nM2\n)2\n(10)\nd\u03c3\u02c6\ndt\u02c6\n(gg \u2192 bb\u00af) \u2243 \u03c0\u03b1\n2\nS\n6p2TM\n2\n(\n1 \u2212 2p\n2\nT\nM2\n)\n.\n3The NLO correction is not yet known for double- diffractive dijet production from a colour-singlet state.\nThe corresponding K-factor is expected to be about the same, or a little larger, than that for Higgs production.\n4\nSince p2T < M\n2\/4 the bb\u00af background is suppressed relative to the gg background by\nd\u03c3\u02c6(gg \u2192 bb\u00af)\nd\u03c3\u02c6(gg \u2192 gg) <\n1\n4\u00d7 27 < 10\n\u22122. (11)\nMoreover, we emphasize that for the exclusive process the initial gg state obeys special\nselection rules. Besides being a colour-singlet, for forward outgoing protons the projection of\nthe total angular momentum is Jz = 0 along the beam axis\n4. On the other hand, the Born\namplitude for light fermion pair production5 vanishes in this Jz = 0 state, see, for example,\n[12]. This result follows from P - and T -invariance and fermion helicity conservation of the\nJz = 0 amplitude [13]. Thus, if we were to neglect the b-quark mass mb, then at leading\norder we would have no QCD bb\u00af-dijet background at all. Even beyond LO, the interference\nbetween the signal and background amplitudes is negligibly small, since they have different\nhelicity structure. Therefore the form of the peak, observed in double- diffractive exclusive\nH \u2192 bb\u00af production, will not be affected by interference with bb\u00af jets produced by the pure QCD\nbackground process.\nOf course, a non-vanishing bb\u00af rate is predicted when we allow for the quark mass or if we\nemit an extra gluon. Nevertheless in the former case we still have an additional suppression\nto (11) of about a factor of m2b\/p\n2\nT \u2243 4m2b\/M2H < 10\u22122, whereas in the latter case the extra\nsuppression is about \u03b1S\/\u03c0 \u2243 0.05. Note that events containing the third (gluon) jet may be\nexperimentally separated from Higgs decay, where the two jets are dominantly co-planar6.\nUp to now we have discussed forward outgoing protons in the idealized case where their\ntransverse momenta q1T , q2T \u2192 0. In reality there is a strong correlation between these trans-\nverse momenta. In particular, it implies that factorization (whereby the cross section is a\nproduct of Pomeron emission factors multiplied by the Pomeron-Pomeron fusion subprocess)\nis not valid [11]. It is thus remarkable that the suppression of the double-diffractive bb\u00af dijet\nproduction (the QCD background process) is still valid for non-zero q1T and q2T . Indeed, the\npolarization vectors \u03b5j of the \u2018hard\u2019 gluons in Fig. 1 are directed along (Q+ qi)j , where j = 1, 2\ndenotes the two transverse components of the momenta. In the case where we neglected qiT\nand averaged over the direction of QT we obtained the polarization tensor\n\u03b5j\u03b5k \u223c QjQk \u223c \u03b4(2)jk\nQ2T\n2\n, (12)\nwhich corresponds to the Jz = 0 di-gluon state. However, for non-zero qit the tensor becomes\n\u03b5j\u03b5k \u223c (Q+ q1)j (Q+ q2)k \u223c \u03b4(2)jk\nQ2T\n2\n+ q1j q2k. (13)\n4This statement remains valid even when the blobs in Fig. 1, which describe the radiation of two t-channel\ngluons by the protons, include leading order BFKL or DGLAP ladders.\n5For light quark pair exclusive production, p+p\u2192 p+qq\u00af+p, with forward outgoing protons, the cancellation\nwas first observed by Pumplin [11], see also [10, 3].\n6The situation here is similar to the signal-to-background ratio for intermediate mass Higgs production in\npolarised \u03b3\u03b3 collisions, which was studied in detail in [13, 14].\n5\nThe linear term in QT vanishes after the QT angular integration. In this way we obtain an\nadmixture of Jz = \u00b12 di-gluon states, which leads to a contribution of the order of 4q21T q22T\/Q4T\nto the gg \u2192 bb\u00af cross section. Thus the integral over the QT loop in the amplitude (that is the\ndijet counterpart to (3)) becomes less infrared safe. However the Sudakov-like form factor (5)\nand the effective anomalous dimension, \u03b3 > 0, of the gluon (xg(x,Q2T ) \u223c (Q2T )\u03b3) still suppress\nthe contribution from the infrared domain [5]. If we use the MRS gluon [15], we find the integral\ntypically samples QT values in the region Q\n2\nT \u2243 1.5(3) GeV2 at the Tevatron (LHC) energy.\nThus the |Jz| = 2 admixture does not contribute more than 5% (1.5%) of the dijet cross section;\nhere we take a mean qT of 400 MeV. Of course the |Jz| = 2 contribution may be suppressed by\nselecting forward protons with smaller qT .\nSo finally we see that identifying the H \u2192 bb\u00af signal allows the background to be suppressed\nby more than a factor 3000. The signal is thus in excess of the background, even for a mass\nresolution of \u2206M \u223c 4 GeV. There is therefore an opportunity to see a clear peak at M =MH ,\nprovided the cross section for double-diffractive Higgs production is large enough.\n3.3 The cross section for p(p\u00af ) \u2192 p+H + (p\u00af )\nThe cross section for double-diffractive Higgs production at Tevatron and LHC energies has\nbeen calculated by several authors7 [4, 5, 6, 8]. If our recent perturbative QCD determination\n[8] is updated to incorporate the latest rapidity gap survival probability estimates8 of Ref. [16],\nthen\n\u03c3H \u2261 \u03c3(pp\u00af\u2192 p+H + p\u00af) \u2243 0.06 fb at\n\u221a\ns = 2 TeV (14)\nfor a Higgs boson of mass 120 GeV. Note that the value of cross section (14) is comparable to the\ncross section generated by the \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 H fusion subprocess. Recall that this QED contribution\ncomes from large impact parameters, where the corresponding gap survival probability S2 = 1\n[8]. \u03c3(\u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 H) is estimated to be about 0.03 fb at \u221as = 2 TeV and 0.3 fb at \u221as = 14 TeV.\nNote that the strong and electromagnetic contributions have negligible interference, because\nthey occur at quite different values of the impact parameter:\n\u3008\u03c12T \u3009em \u226b Bel \u223c 20 GeV\u22122,\n(15)\n\u3008\u03c12T \u3009str \u223c 4 GeV\u22122,\nwhere Bel is the t-slope of the elastic pp cross section.\nPrediction (14) is lower than estimates made by other authors. However it may be checked\nexperimentally, since exactly the same mechanism, and calculation, is relevant to double-\ndiffractive dijet production. Indeed, double-diffractive dijet production, for jets with ET >\n7A more complete set of references to related theoretical papers can be found in Ref. [2].\n8The gap survival probability for the double-diffractive processes is estimated to be S2 = 0.05 at\n\u221a\ns = 2 TeV\nand S2 = 0.02 at\n\u221a\ns = 14 TeV.\n6\n7 GeV, has been studied by CDF collaboration [17]. They find an upper limit for the cross\nsection, \u03c3(dijet) < 3.7 nb, as compared to our prediction of about 1 nb [18]. Using the dijet\nprocess as a monitor thus rules out the much larger predictions for \u03c3(pp\u00af \u2192 p +H + p\u00af) which\nexist in the literature. Unfortunately the prediction \u03c3H \u2243 0.06 fb of (14) means that Run II of\nthe Tevatron, with an integrated luminosity of L = 15fb\u22121, should yield less than an event. We\nshould add that the double-diffractive Higgs search can also be made in the \u03c4+\u03c4\u2212 and WW \u2217\ndecay channels [2], but, due to the small branching ratios, then the event rate is even less.\nOn the other hand, the cross section \u03c3H , calculated in the perturbative QCD approach\n[5, 8, 16], grows with energy and at\n\u221a\ns = 14 TeV reaches \u03c3H \u2243 2.2fb (corresponding to\nd\u03c3H\/dy \u2243 0.6 fb at y = 0). In fact, if we were to ignore the rapidity gap survival probability,\nS2, then \u03c3H would have increased by more than a factor of 100 in going from\n\u221a\ns = 2 TeV to\u221a\ns = 14 TeV. However at larger energies the probability to produce secondaries which populate\nthe gap increases and so \u03c3(pp\u2192 p+H+ p) increases only by a factor of 40. Nevertheless there\nis a real chance to observe double-diffractive Higgs production at the LHC9, since both the\ncross section and the luminosity are much larger than at the Tevatron.\n4 Double-diffractive \u03c7 meson production\nOf course, the missing-mass method may be used, not only for Higgs searches, but for many\nother double-diffractive exclusive reactions. Particularly relevant examples are the production\nof scalar (0++) \u03c7c and \u03c7b mesons [2, 19]. These processes will allow another check, albeit\nqualitative, of our perturbative QCD techniques10 for calculating double-diffractive processes\n[8]. In addition there are two reasons why \u03c7 production processes are of interest in their own\nright. First, the production of \u03c7 mesons with a rapidity gap on either side ensures the selection\nof pure colour-singlet states, so there can be no admixture from a colour-octet production\nmechanism. This should illuminate the dynamics of the hadroproduction of mesons containing\nheavy quarks. Second, the data on inclusive bb\u00af production at the Tevatron lies about a factor\nof 3 above the conventional NLO QCD prediction. A measurement of \u03c7b diffractive production\nis thus of interest.\nAs mentioned above, the cross section for double-diffractive \u03c7 meson production may be\ncalculated by the same perturbative QCD approach that was applied to Higgs and dijet pro-\nduction [8]. The gg \u2192 \u03c7 vertex is given in terms of the width of the \u03c7 meson. We assume\n\u0393(\u03c7 \u2192 gg) \u2243 \u0393tot(\u03c7), with an observed width of \u0393tot = 14.9 MeV [20] for the \u03c7c(0++) me-\nson. For \u03c7b(0\n++) we used the QCD lattice result [21] for the leading order \u0393(\u03c7 \u2192 gg) width\n9Note that Refs. [5, 8, 16] do not address the complications caused by multiple (or \u2018pile-up\u2019) interactions at\nthe high luminosities at the LHC.\n10We also have to include a suppression factor which represents the survival probability of the rapidity gaps.\nThis probability S2 has been calculated for a range of diffractive processes in, for example, Ref. [16].\n7\nof 354 keV. To be more precise, we included the standard NLO correction (1 + 9.8\u03b1S\/\u03c0) for\n\u03c7b(0\n++), see, for example, [22]. We assume that the amplitude for \u03c7 production behaves as\nM \u221d eb(t1+t2)\/2 (16)\nwith slope b = 4 GeV\u22122, where ti are the momentum transfer squared at the proton (antiproton)\nvertices. For\n\u221a\ns = 2 TeV we take the rapidity gap survival probability to be S2 = 0.05\n[16]. With these input values, the double-diffractive cross sections estimated for Run II of the\nTevatron are\n\u03c3\n(\n\u03c7c(0\n++)\n)\n\u2243 600 nb,\n(17)\n\u03c3\n(\n\u03c7b(0\n++)\n)\n\u2243 110 pb.\nThe corresponding rapidity distributions d\u03c3\/dy are shown in Fig. 2.\nNote that the double-diffractive production of exclusive axial vector (1++) and tensor (2++)\nquarkonium states are strongly suppressed11. The former results from the Landau-Yang the-\norem [24] which forbids the 1++ \u2192 2g transition for massless gluons. The latter is directly\nrelated to the helicity-zero selection rule which we have discussed above. It was known for a\nlong time that in the non-relativistic limit the Jz = 0 amplitude for the \u03b3\u03b3 decay of the 2\n++ 3P2\npositronium state vanishes [25]. This, of course, remains valid for the helicity-zero transition\nof a heavy tensor quarkonium state into two gluons [26].\nIn reality, exclusive tensor \u03c7-meson production will occur due to corrections caused by\nrelativistic effects (which are expected to be numerically small [27]), as well as by the off-mass-\nshell corrections to the helicity-zero transition and by the admixture of |Jz| = 2 di-gluon states,\nwhich we explained in Section 3.2. The largest contribution is expected from non-forward\ncorrections, arising from the second term on the right-hand-side of (13). The \u03c7(2++) rate may\ntherefore be as large as the fraction 0.2\u0393(2++)\/\u0393(0++) of the \u03c7(0++) production cross sections of\n(17). As a consequence we anticipate a decrease of the \u03c7(2++) cross section in the very forward\nregion. Note that the Jz = 0 selection rule becomes redundant for inclusive double-diffractive\nprocesses, so, for example, 2++ \u03c7-production will become more significant.\nOf course the estimates of double-diffractive \u03c7 production are much less infrared stable than\nthose for Higgs production. For example, using GRV partons [28] down to Q2 = 0.36 GeV2,\nrather than MRS partons [15] with frozen anomalous dimension for Q2 < 1 GeV2, to calculate\nthe gluon loop contribution at low virtuality12, enlarges the cross section by about a factor of\n3 for \u03c7b, and even larger for \u03c7c. It is known that the GRV gluon is rather too large in this\ndomain. However the comparison does demonstrate the infrared sensitivity of the estimates,\n11The vanishing of the forward double-diffractive 1++ and 2++ quarkonium production was recently pointed\nout by F. Yuan [23] who used a non-relativistic formula for the evaluation of P -wave quarkonium decays.\n12The contribution from the Q2 > 1 GeV2 is approximately independent of whether GRV or MRS partons\nare used.\n8\nwhich for such low mass particles should only be considered as an indication of the size of\nthe cross section. Nevertheless the \u03c7 cross sections are huge. For an integrated luminosity of\nL = 15 fb\u22121 in Run II of the Tevatron we expect about 106 \u03c7b events with a large rapidity gap\non either side of the meson.\n5 Gluon factory\nThe high event rate and the remarkable purity of the di-gluon system, that is generated in\nthe exclusive double-diffractive production process, provides a unique13 environment to make\ndetailed studies of high energy gluon jets. Indeed we may speak of a \u2018gluon factory\u2019, since, as\ndiscussed in Section 3.2, double-diffractive quark di-jet production is strongly suppressed (by\nthe Jz = 0 selection rule). Recall that a precise comparison of quark and gluon jets requires\nthat the two isolated gluon jets are produced from a point-like colour-singlet state14 \u2014 the\ncounterpart of the celebrated e+e\u2212 \u2192 qq\u00af process \u2014 see [30, 32] for recent reviews.\nNote that for QCD studies of gluon jets, the requirement of high resolution on the dijet\nmass is not essential. Based on the estimates performed in Ref. [8], we expect, for example,\nabout 105 gg events per day with 45 < ET (jet) < 55 GeV, at the LHC, assuming a luminosity\nof 1 fb\u22121\/day and neglecting corrections for acceptance and efficiency. This number should be\ncompared with the present experimental studies of the so-called unbiased gluon jets performed\nby the OPAL collaboration at LEP1 [33]. Here gluon jets are identified in double-tagged\nZ \u2192 bb\u00afg events. Over about five years of running only 439 pure gluon events were identified.\n6 Problems with a high-resolution pure missing-mass\nmethod\nAt first sight it looks attractive to use the missing-mass approach to search for (non-Standard\nModel) Higgs bosons which decay into invisible modes, such as gravitinos, neutralinos or gravi-\ntons. The possibility of observing such an invisible Higgs in inclusive processes at the LHC was\ndiscussed recently in Ref. [34]. Indeed in the exclusive channel, pp \u2192 p + H + p, one should\nobserve just two outgoing protons and nothing else but a sharp peak in the missing-mass distri-\nbution. Unfortunately it is not clear how accurately it is possible to eliminate the background\n13Rather we should say it is almost unique, since sometime ago it was proposed [29] that a polarized \u03b3\u03b3\nfacility at a photon linear collider could also allow an experimental study of gluon jets via the process \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 gg\nin the Jz = 0 initial state.\n14It is often said that a detailed study of the properties of gluon jets can be made by separating out the\ncontribution of the gg \u2192 gg subprocess to a hadronic reaction. In many cases this approach could be misleading\nsince the gg events do not originate from a pure colour-singlet system. The interference between emissions from\nincoming and outgoing gluons leads to coherence effects which can strongly affect the final hadronic system,\nsee, for example, [30, 31].\n9\ncaused, for example, by QED radiation from the protons, or maybe even from radiative decays\nof low mass proton excitations. The problem is that the probability to lose some energy by\nradiating photons of energy \u03c9 in the interval d\u03c9 is of order (2\u03b1\/3\u03c0)(\u3008q2T \u3009\/m2)(d\u03c9\/\u03c9) [35], where\nqT is the transverse momentum of the outgoing proton of mass m. Therefore the cross section\nfor pp\u2192 (p\u03b3) + (p\u03b3), which may mimic a missing-mass event, is about\nd\u03c3\ndy\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\ny=0\n\u223c\n(\n2\u03b1\n3\u03c0\n\u3008q2T \u3009\nm2\n)2 (\ndM2\nM2\n)\n\u03c3el \u223c 0.8 pb, (18)\nwhere we have assumed M = 120 GeV,\u2206M = 250 MeV, and taken \u03c3el \u2243 25 mb and \u3008q2T \u3009 =\n1\/Bel \u2243 0.05 GeV2 at LHC energies. This is huge in comparison to the cross section d\u03c3\/dyH \u2243\n0.6 fb for pp \u2192 p + H + p. Of course some of the QED radiation may be detected by an\nadditional dedicated forward electromagnetic calorimeter15. Also it is necessary to allow for\nthe radiative tail which will spread out the shape of the Higgs peak.\nThis illustrates a basic problem in searching for rare processes using high-resolution missing-\nmass measurements which observe only the forward protons. There will always be the possibility\nthat part of the proton energy will escape undetected down, or near, the beam pipe. Of course\nthis deficiency would not exist if we were able to measure the products of the rare process\nwith sufficient accuracy to confirm that their invariant mass coincides with the missing-mass\nmeasurement. In this case the main purpose of the forward proton missing-mass detector would\nbe to considerably improve the \u2206M resolution. For the gluon factory there is no problem, since\nhigh resolution is not essential and the event rate is enormous. The missing-mass detector is\nused just to select large rapidity gap events. Similarly there is no problem for double-diffractive\n\u03c7 meson production if the various decay modes are observed.\n7 Conclusion\nWe have studied the proposal of triggering on forward going protons and antiprotons to perform\na high resolution missing-mass search for the Higgs boson at the Tevatron, that is the process\npp\u00af \u2192 p +H + p\u00af where a \u2018plus\u2019 denotes a large rapidity gap. However, we find that there is a\nhuge QCD background arising from double-diffractive dijet production. A central detector to\ntrigger on large ET jets is essential. Even so, the signal-to-background ratio is too small for a\nviable \u2018missing-mass\u2019 Higgs search. The situation is much improved if we identify b and b\u00af jets.\nThe gg \u2192 H \u2192 bb\u00af signal is now in excess of the QCD gg \u2192 bb\u00af background, even for a mass\nresolution of \u2206M \u223c 4 GeV. The only problem is that, when proper account is taken of the\nsurvival probability of the rapidity gaps, the pp\u00af \u2192 p + H + p\u00af event rate is too small at the\nTevatron. Recall that the experimental limit on the cross section for double-diffractive dijet\nproduction confirms the predicted small rates.\n15We thank A. Rostovtsev for discussions about photon detection.\n10\nThe pessimistic expectations of the missing-mass Higgs search at the Tevatron are, how-\never, compensated by an interesting by-product of the double-diffractive proposal. The double-\ndiffractive production of dijets offers a unique gluon factory, generating huge numbers of essen-\ntially pure gluon jets from a colour-singlet state in an exceptionally clean environment. Recall\nthat the exclusive production of qq\u00af dijets, with a large rapidity gap on either side, is strongly\nsuppressed by the Jz = 0 selection rule.\nFinally, we give estimates for the double-diffractive production of \u03c7b and \u03c7c mesons at the\nTevatron. These mesons have smaller mass than the Higgs boson or dijet systems that we have\nconsidered, and so the QCD cross section estimates are much more qualitative. Nevertheless\nthe rates are huge, and the observation of \u03c7b and \u03c7c production (from colour-singlet states)\nshould illuminate intriguing features of heavy flavour dynamics.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank M.
