Extrapolation methods which use existing data for estimating the effects 4 \nof chemicals are attractive to industry, and comparative data are therefore increasingly in 5 \ndemand.  Data on natural toxic chemicals could be used for extrapolation methods such as 6 \nread-across. To test this hypothesis, the toxicity of natural chemicals and their synthetic 7 \nanalogues were compared using standardised toxicity tests. Two chemical pairs: the 8 \nnapthoquinones, juglone (natural) and 1,4-naphthoquinone (synthetic); and anthraquinones, 9 \nemodin (natural) and quinizarin (synthetic)) were chosen, and their comparative effects on the 10 \nsurvival and reproduction of collembolans, earthworms, enchytraeids and predatory mites 11 \nwere assessed. Differences in sensitivity between the species were observed with the 12 \npredatory mite (Hypoaspis aculeifer) showing the least sensitivity. Within the chemical pairs, 13 \ntoxicity to lethal and sub- lethal endpoints was very similar for the four invertebrate species. 14 \nThe exception was earthworm reproduction, which showed differential sensitivity to the 15 \nchemicals in both naphthoquinone and anthraquinone pairs.  Differences in toxicity identified 16 \nin the present study may be related to degree of exposure and\/or subtle differences in the 17 \nmode of toxic action for the chemicals and species tested.  It may be possible to predict 18 \ndifferences by identifying functional groups which infer increased or decreased toxicity in one 19 \nor other chemical. The development of such techniques would enable the use of read-across 20 \nfrom natural to synthetic chemicals for a wider group of compounds. 21 \n 22 \n 23 \nKeywords: anthraquinone, napthoquinone, ecotoxicity, risk assessment 24 \n 3 \n1. Introduction 25 \nIt is estimated that of the 100,000 chemical substances registered in the European market 26 \nbefore 1981, one third still lack information on their intrinsic properties and only 140 have 27 \nbeen singled out for risk assessment (DEFRA, 2006). The introduction of REACH 28 \n(Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals) in 2008, requires companies to 29 \nregister and risk assess all substances produced or imported in volumes of >1 tonne per year 30 \n(30,000 substances), however, the available data are often insufficient to assess the range of 31 \nchemicals currently in use.  Integral to REACH is a requirement to reduce the need for further 32 \ntoxicity testing. Consequently, methods which use existing data for estimating the effects of 33 \nsubstances are attractive to industry: for example Quantitative Structure-Activity 34 \nRelationships (QSARs), and read-across. Such approaches rely on the principle that the 35 \nchemical structure of a substance determines its behaviour and effects.  36 \n 37 \nData on natural plant toxins could potentially be used for read-across type methods. Plants 38 \nproduce and release into the environment an enormous range of chemicals including: 39 \nphenolics, terpenoids and alkaloids (38,000 characterised) (Langenheim, 1994; Harborne and 40 \nBaxter, 1996). Data on the fate and effects of these natural toxins could provide insight into 41 \nthe potential impacts of structurally similar synthetic chemicals.  Previous work, using 42 \nliterature data, has shown strong similarities in the fate and effects of natural plant toxins and 43 \nsynthetic analogues in soils (Sorokin, 2007; Sorokin and Whitaker 2008).  In order to confirm 44 \nthe suitability of using data on natural toxins for read-across methods, we made experimental 45 \ncomparisons of the toxicity of two chemical pairs on the survival and reproduction of four 46 \ngroups of soil invertebrates: earthworms; collembolans; enchytraeids; and predatory mites 47 \nusing standard ecotoxicity tests. In comparing the toxicity to four representative groups of soil 48 \n 4 \ninvertebrates we aimed to determine whether read-across could be used to assess the toxicity 49 \nof chemicals in soil ecosystems.   50 \n 51 \nNatural chemicals produced by plants were chosen with properties relevant to the risk 52 \nassessment of synthetic chemicals i.e. presence in soil, persistence in soil and potential 53 \ntoxicity to a range of soil organisms. In addition, natural chemicals were chosen so that 54 \nsuitable synthetic analogues could be selected, representative of chemicals for which risk 55 \nassessments may need to be carried out.  Based on these criteria two natural chemicals were 56 \nchosen (Table 1). Juglone (5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone), a naphthoquinone identified in 57 \nthe walnut genus Juglans (Willis, 2000), and emodin (1,3,8-trihydroxy-6-58 \nmethylanthraquinone), an anthraquinone identified in at least 94 plant species (Izhaki, 2002).  59 \nSynthetic analogues for each chemical were then chosen: for juglone, 1,4-naphthoquinone; 60 \nand for emodin, 1,4-dihydroxyanthraquinone (known as quinizarin)  (ECB, 2004). Both 61 \nsynthetic chemicals have wide industrial uses including chemical synthesis, textile processing, 62 \nbiocide manufacture and in the colouring industries (IUCLID, 2000). 63 \n 64 \n2. Material and Methods  65 \nStandardized methods have been developed for assessing chemical toxicity to soil 66 \ninvertebrates.  To address the objectives of this study we chose the collembolan reproduction 67 \ntest (ISO, 1999); the earthworm reproduction test (OECD, 2004a); the enchytraeid 68 \nreproduction test (OECD, 2004b); and a modified predatory mite reproduction test (Hamers 69 \nand Krogh, 1997). Since the completion of these experiments, OECD have published 70 \nGuideline 226 for testing chemical effects on reproduction of predatory mites (OECD, 2008), 71 \nhowever our method differs from this guideline in a number of ways.  In addition, a number 72 \n 5 \nof minor deviations from published protocols were necessary in order to complete this wide 73 \nrange of tests, all deviations are detailed in the methods below. 74 \n 75 \n2.1 Test species 76 \nAll cultures were kept at 20 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C with a 16:8 h photo-period prior to testing. Folsomia 77 \ncandida (Collembola: Isotomidae) obtained from Reading University, were cultured on a 78 \nmoist substrate of plaster of Paris\/charcoal (8:1) and fed dried bakers yeast. Synchronised 79 \ncohorts for testing were obtained by transferring several hundred adults to clean culture 80 \nvessels for 2-3 days. Adults were then removed to allow eggs laid by the females to hatch.  81 \nEisenia fetida (Lumbricidae: Oligochaeta) were purchased from Aquaculture Supplies, UK. 82 \nThey were kept in commercial culture soil at ~35% soil moisture content and were fed dried 83 \nand ground rabbit manure as required.  Cultures of Enchytraeus albidus (Enchytraeidae: 84 \nOligochaeta) were also purchased from Aquaculture Supplies, UK in commercial culture 85 \nmedium and fed ground rolled oats as required.  Cultures of Hypoaspis aculeifer Canestrini 86 \n(Gamasida: Laelapidae) were purchased from Biological Crop Protection Ltd., UK.  They 87 \nwere cultured under the same conditions as F. candida, and were fed with F. candida or 88 \nFolsomia fimetaria L. (Collembola: Isotomidae) as required. Synchronised cultures for testing 89 \nwere obtained by transferring several hundred adults to clean culture vessels at a ratio of 10 90 \nfemales: 5 males for 3 days. Adults were then removed to allow eggs laid by the females to 91 \nhatch.   92 \n 93 \n2.2 Chemicals 94 \nJuglone (5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone), 1,4-naphthoquinone, quinizarin (1,4-95 \ndihydroxyanthraquinone), acetone and dichloromethane (DCM) were obtained from Sigma-96 \n 6 \nAldrich, UK. Emodin (1,3,8-trihydroxy-6-methylanthraquinone) was obtained from 97 \nXtrasynthase France. All reagents were of 95 % purity or greater.  98 \n 99 \n2.3 Test soil and treatments  100 \nAll tests were conducted in standard OECD artificial soil (pH 6 \u00b1 0.5 (pH-KCl) (OECD, 101 \n2004a).  Soil moisture content was maintained at 35% maximum water holding capacity 102 \n(WHC, d. wt.) for tests with E. fetida and F. candida and 50 % maximum WHC for tests with 103 \nE. albidus and H. aculeifer. Range-finding mortality tests were conducted with each chemical 104 \nand each test species to determine a suitable concentration range for the reproduction tests.  105 \nEight concentrations with a factor of two spacing were used in each test, with three replicates 106 \nper test concentration.  Concentrations ranged from 8 to 1024 mg kg-1 d. wt for all tests, 107 \nexcept the enchytraeid and predatory mite tests with the napthoquinones where the range was 108 \n4 to 512 mg kg-1 (range adjusted due to range-finding test results).  These concentrations were 109 \nnominal as we did not analyse the treated soil to determine the actual concentrations due to 110 \nthe complexity of analysing these compounds.  In addition controls and solvent controls were 111 \nprepared with either three (mites), six (collembola and earthworm) or eight (enchytraeid) 112 \nreplicates.  113 \n 114 \n(a) Soil treatments for collembola, earthworm and predatory mite tests 115 \nTest substances were dissolved in a 50:50 (v:v) mixture of DCM and acetone to produce stock 116 \nsolutions corresponding to the highest test dosage. Test soils were prepared by mixing the 117 \nappropriate amount of stock solution into the soil. Solvent controls (50:50, acetone : DCM) 118 \nwere prepared in the same manner using the highest volume of solvent used to generate the 119 \ntest soils (50 ml kg-1 or 26.5 ml kg-1 for H. aculeifer). After mixing, the solvent was 120 \n 7 \nevaporated for 24 h after which the water content of the soil was adjusted to 35 % maximum 121 \nWHC (50 % for H. aculeifer).  122 \n 123 \n(b) Soil treatments for enchytraeid test 124 \nTest substances were dissolved in acetone in a stock solution corresponding to the highest test 125 \ndosage.  For this test the treated soil was prepared individually in each test vessel.  Sand (1 g) 126 \nwas placed in each screw top glass jar (~200 ml vol.), appropriate volumes of the test 127 \nsolutions were then added to the sand and allowed to evaporate for 24 h.  In addit ion, to the 128 \ntest soils, controls, and solvent controls (acetone) were prepared in the same manner using the 129 \nhighest volume of solvent used to generate the test soils (500 ml kg-1 acetone). Half-130 \nmoistened soil (20 g d. wt) was then added to each jar and mixed thoroughly. After mixing, 131 \nthe moisture content of the soils was adjusted to 50 % maximum WHC.  132 \n 133 \n2.4 Ecotoxicity tests 134 \n(a) Collembola reproduction test  135 \nTests were carried out in 100 ml glass jars filled with 30 g (w. wt.) of test soil. Fifteen, 10-136 \n12 d old F. candida were placed into each vessel with 2 mg of bakers yeast. Test vessels were 137 \nmaintained at 20 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C with a 16:8 h photo-period and moisture levels were adjusted twice 138 \nweekly.  After 14 d, 2 mg of bakers yeast was added to each vessel and after 28 d the test was 139 \nterminated. Jars were flooded with deionised water, stirred, and the contents transferred to 140 \n200 ml glass containers. A small quantity (~2 ml) of black Indian ink was added to each jar to 141 \nincrease the definition of the collembolans for counting. Digital photographs were taken and 142 \nthe number of surviving adults and juveniles quantified by manual counting and marking of 143 \nphotographs. 144 \n 145 \n 8 \n(b) Earthworm reproduction test 146 \nFlat-bottomed glass jars (1 L) were filled with 800 g (w. wt.) of test soil and eight adult 147 \nE. fetida (400 \u00b1 100 mg) with a pronounced clitellum were placed into each vessel. After 148 \n24 h, 0.5 g of dried, ground rabbit manure was added to each vessel and weekly thereafter. 149 \nVessels were sealed with netting and elastic bands, maintained at 20 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C with a 16:8 h 150 \nphoto-period and moisture levels adjusted three times per week.  After 28 d, adult earthworms 151 \nwere dry sieved from the test vessels using a 10 mm sieve, and the number of surviving adults 152 \nwas recorded. The sieved soils were then returned to the vessels with additional food (0.5 g)  153 \nand left for a further 28 d. After this time each vessel was wet sieved using 1 and 0.5 mm 154 \nsieves and the number of juvenile worms counted. 155 \n 156 \n(c) Enchytraeid reproduction test  157 \nPrior to the test, approximately 1000 adult E. albidus (approx 1 cm long with eggs in the 158 \nclitellum region) were acclimated in OECD artificial soil for 24 h.  Test soils were prepared in 159 \neach test vessel (20 g d. wt.) as described above.  Autoclaved, ground rolled oats (50 mg) 160 \nwere mixed into the soil in each vessel and 10 adult E. albidus added. Test vessels were then 161 \ncovered with parafilm, maintained at 20 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C with a 16:8 h photo-period and moisture levels 162 \nadjusted weekly.  On days 7, 14, 21 and 35, 25 mg of rolled oats were added to each vessel. 163 \nOn day 21, all adult worms were removed and counted and any changes in adult behaviour 164 \nwere observed.  After 42 d the test was terminated newly hatched worms stained using the 165 \nBengal staining method (OECD, 2004b) and counted under a microscope (10x mag.).  166 \n 167 \n(d) Predatory mite reproduction test  168 \nThis method was based on the method of Hamers and Krogh (1997) which has since been 169 \nmodified and published as OECD (2008). Containers consisting of a Perspex cylinder (5.5 cm 170 \n 9 \nhigh, 6 cm diameter) with a 1 mm mesh base were filled with 60 g (w. wt.) of test soil. On day 171 \n0, 100 collembolan prey (16-19 d old F. fimetaria) were introduced to each test vessel and 172 \nallowed to disperse for 1 h. Ten female and 5 male H. aculeifer (16-19 d old) were allocated 173 \nto each test vessel and the vessels were then covered with parafilm, maintained at 20 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C  174 \nwith a 12:12 h photo-period and moisture levels adjusted weekly. Collembolan prey were fed 175 \nwith 15 mg bakers yeast every 7 days and mites were fed young ~20 d old F. fimetaria twice 176 \nper week.   On day 21 the test was terminated and test vessels transferred to high gradient 177 \nextractors for 48 h (25 watt bulb). Extracted animals were collected in universal tubes with a 178 \nmoist plaster of paris\/charcoal base, frozen at -18 oC and counted within 48 h. 179 \n 180 \n2.5 Statistical analysis 181 \nAverage adult survival, reproduction (number of juveniles) and juvenile\/adult ratios were 182 \ncalculated at each treatment concentration. Generalised linear models were used to model 183 \neach of these variables as a function of concentration (SAS 9.1).  For adult survival a logit 184 \nlink function was used, since the counts had both an upper and lower bound, with a binomial 185 \nerror.  A log link transformation was used for the juveniles and juvenile\/adult ratios, as these 186 \nwere both counts with no upper limit, with a Poisson error.  In all cases allowance was made 187 \nfor over-dispersion.  Initially models were fitted to the control data to determine whether there 188 \nwas a significant effect of the solvent carrier, on adult survival or reproduction.  Effect 189 \nestimates (LC50, effective concentration causing a 50 % reduction in survival; EC50, effective 190 \nconcentration causing a 50 % reduction in reproduction) were calculated as functions of 191 \nmodel parameters and their standard errors (SE). Likelihood ratio tests were used to compare 192 \ndose response effects across chemicals (SAS v. 9.1). 193 \n 194 \n3. Results 195 \n 10 \n3.1 Control treatments 196 \nAverage adult survival in the controls (non-solvent and solvent) for collembola, earthworms 197 \nand enchytraeids was greater than 95 % (data not shown).  Adult control survival was lower 198 \nfor the predatory mite test at 73 % and 60 % for non-solvent and solvent controls respectively, 199 \nwhich is below the 20 % mortality limit in the OECD guideline published recently.  This may 200 \nbe due to difficulties with the extraction of these organisms from soil.  The number of adults 201 \nsurviving was not significantly affected by the type of control treatment in all experiments 202 \n(p > 0.05, data not shown), and the number of enchytraeid and predatory mite juveniles were 203 \nalso not significantly different between the control and solvent control treatments (p > 0.05).  204 \nIn contrast, the number of juvenile collembola and earthworms were significantly different for 205 \nthe two control types, with higher numbers of juveniles in the solvent control compared with 206 \nthe ordinary control (p < 0.001, data not shown). For F. candida, there was an average of 678 207 \n(\u00b1 73) (mean (\u00b1 SE)) juveniles in the controls and 1273 (\u00b1 107) in the solvent controls, whilst 208 \nfor E. fetida, values were 31 (\u00b1 3) and 63 (\u00b1 5) juveniles for the control and solvent controls 209 \nrespectively. This shows that the presence of the solvent stimulated reproduction in these two 210 \nspecies.  Non-solvent controls were therefore excluded from the statistical analysis of juvenile 211 \ndata for these two species.  For consistency they were also excluded from analysis of adult 212 \nsurvival.  Non-solvent controls and solvent controls were pooled for analysis of the 213 \nenchytraeid and predatory mite data as no solvent effect was observed for these species.   214 \n 215 \n3.2 Toxicity of naphthoquinones 216 \nExposure to juglone and 1,4-naphthoquinone significantly reduced survival and reproduction 217 \nof F. candida, E. fetida, and E. albidus, with clear dose-response relationships observed (Fig. 218 \n1a-c, Table 2). The exception was the predatory mite H. aculeifer which had lower sensitivity 219 \nto the two chemicals compared to the other species, with no significant effect of either 220 \n 11 \nchemical on reproduction (Fig. 1d, Table 2). The juvenile\/adult ratio was not significantly 221 \naffected by juglone for the four species tested, indicating that where adults survived they 222 \nreproduced at the same rate, irrespective of exposure concentration (Table 2). In contrast, 223 \nwhen exposed to 1,4-naphthoquinone, adult reproduction rates (juvenile:adult ratio) of all 224 \nspecies except F. candida decreased significantly with increasing concentration (Table 2).   225 \n 226 \nWhen comparing the relative effects of the natural (juglone) and synthetic (1,4-227 \nnaphthoquinone) naphthoquinones on mortality and reproduction, we found that results were 228 \ngenerally consistent across the four species and two endpoints, with little significant 229 \ndifference in effect of the two chemicals (Table 2).  The exceptions to this were earthworm 230 \nreproduction, which was significantly more sensitive to 1,4-naphthoquinone compared to 231 \njuglone (p < 0.0001) and collembolan survival which was also more sensitive to 1,4-232 \nnaphthoquinone (Table 2).  These differences are reflected in the EC50 values for earthworm 233 \nreproduction of 239 (\u00b1 55) and 99 (\u00b1 24) mg kg-1 and the LC50 values for collembolan 234 \nsurvival of 124 (\u00b1 34) and 75 (\u00b1 15) mg kg-1 for juglone and 1,4-naphthoquinone respectively, 235 \nillustrating the higher toxicity of 1,4-naphthoquinone in these instances (Table 2). 236 \n 237 \nA comparison of the LC50 and EC50 values was conducted to examine the relative sensitivity 238 \nof the two endpoints tested.  This comparison revealed that the relative sensitivity of survival 239 \nand reproduction was consistent within the species tested but varied interspecifically (Table 240 \n2).  For F. candida, reproduction was less sensitive than survival for both napthoquinones, 241 \nwhilst for E. fetida and E. albidus the opposite was true. 242 \n 243 \n3.3 Toxicity of anthraquinones 244 \n 12 \nOverall, the anthraquinones were considerably less toxic to the four species than the 245 \nnaphthoquinones. Despite this, some interspecific variation in sensitivity of both mortality and 246 \nreproduction was revealed in the results.  The only significant finding was that emodin 247 \nsignificantly inhibited reproduction of E. fetida, with an EC50 value of 182 (\u00b1 44) mg kg-1 248 \n(Table 2, Fig. 2b).  In contrast adult E. fetida were insensitive to anthraquinone exposure in 249 \nterms of survival. This finding was reflected in the significant effect of emodin on the 250 \njuvenile\/adult ratio.   Of the four species tested, E. albidus was the least sensitive to the two 251 \nanthraquinones, with no significant effect on survival or reproduction (the apparent significant 252 \npositive dose response relationship for adult survival under exposure to emodin is an artefact 253 \nof the very small variation in survival rates for this species) (Table 2, Fig. 2c).  Results from 254 \nthe predatory mite tests showed no significant effect of either chemical on survival or 255 \nreproduction.  Examination of the plotted data (Fig. 2d) shows very similar response to the 256 \ntwo chemicals, however, the variability of the dataset makes it difficult to draw firm 257 \nconclusions.  258 \n 259 \nConclusions on the relative toxicity of emodin (natural) and quinizarin (synthetic) were 260 \ngenerally consistent across the four species tested.  The two chemicals had similar toxicity to 261 \neach other with respect to adult survival and reproduction for three out of four species (Table 262 \n2). The exceptions to this were effects on adult survival of E. albidus and reproduction of 263 \nE. fetida.  For E. albidus, the apparent increased survival under increasing doses of emodin is 264 \nclearly erroneous and Figure 2c illustrates negligible effects of the two chemicals. Sensitivity 265 \nof earthworm reproduction was significantly different for the two chemicals, with 266 \nreproduction more sensitive to emodin than quinizarin (p < 0.0001). This finding was 267 \nconfirmed by the EC50 values of 182 (\u00b1 44) mg kg-1 and >512 mg kg-1 for emodin and 268 \nquinizarin respectively (Table 2). 269 \n 13 \n 270 \n4. Discussion 271 \nThis study compared the toxicity of two chemical pairs from natural and synthetic origins to 272 \ntest the hypothesis that \u201cchemicals which are structurally similar will have similar toxic 273 \neffects\u201d.  Overall, the experiments produced consistent results which revealed that within the 274 \nchemical pairs, toxicity to lethal and sub- lethal endpoints was similar for the four invertebrate 275 \nspecies tested. The exception to this rule was earthworm reproduction, which showed 276 \ndifferential sensitivity to the chemicals in both naphthoquinone  and anthraquinone pairs.  The 277 \nstudy also revealed that at the highest concentrations tested naphthoquinones were 278 \nsignificantly more toxic than the anthraquinones to survival and reproduction, for three of the 279 \nfour species tested. 280 \n 281 \n4.1 Toxicity measurements 282 \nThere is very little data available on the toxicity of naphthoquinones and anthraquinones to 283 \nsoil organisms, and there is no information on their toxicity to soil invertebrates.  284 \nNaphthoquinones, particularly juglone, have been reported to have phytotoxic and anti-285 \nmicrobial properties (Mahoney et al., 2000; Willis, 2000; Hejl and Koster, 2004), and are 286 \ntoxic to a range of aquatic organisms including invertebrates (Wright et al., 2007).  287 \nNaphthoquinones have also been tested for their efficacy as control agents for invertebrate 288 \ncrop pests, as they act as growth-disruptors to above-ground invertebrates (Banerjee et al., 289 \n2001; Lee, 2008).  290 \n 291 \nThere is a similar paucity of data for anthraquinone effects on soil organisms, although 292 \nemodin has been shown to possess allelopathic, phytotoxic, anti-microbial and insecticidal 293 \nproperties (Izhaki, 2002; Basu et al., 2005). Toxicity data for anthraquinones tested 294 \n 14 \nspecifically on soil invertebrates could not be located, however, insecticidal activity of 295 \nemodin to mosquito larvae has been demonstrated (Georges et al., 2008). Anthraquinones 296 \nhave also been tested for their efficacy as biocides in controlling aquatic nuisance species in 297 \nships' ballast water including aquatic plants and invertebrates.  The study concluded that 298 \nnaphthoquinones showed higher toxicity and were toxic to a wider range of organisms than 299 \nanthraquinones, which echoes the conclusions of this study (Wright et al., 2007). Whilst these 300 \nfindings demonstrate the biological activities of naphthoquinones and anthraquinones, the 301 \neffect concentrations cannot be compared with the results of this study as they were not 302 \nconducted in soil, which significantly affects the degree of exposure to which the organisms 303 \nare subjected. 304 \n 305 \n4.2. Interspecific variation in sensitivity  306 \nIn terms of the relative sensitivity of the four invertebrate species, the predatory mite 307 \nH. aculeifer was the least sensitive to the two naphthoquinones.  Exposure to both juglone and  308 \n1,4-naphthoquinone  resulted in 100 % mortality of collembola, earthworms and enchytraeids 309 \nat nominal concentrations = 512 mg kg-1, and reproduction was similarly sensitive (Fig 1a-c).  310 \nIn contrast, neither chemical had significant effects on reproduction of predatory mites, and 311 \ntheir effect on predatory mite survival did not cause 100% mortality at any concentration 312 \ntested (Fig. 1d).  Interspecific differences in sensitivity to the anthraquinones were less clear 313 \ncut than for the naphthoquinones, with conflicting results recorded for the two endpoints.  314 \nEmodin and quinizarin increased mortality of collembola and predatory mites with increasing 315 \nconcentration, but were of limited toxicity to adult survival of earthworms and enchytraeids 316 \n(Table 2, Fig. 2).  Yet, when reproductive effects were examined, earthworm reproduction 317 \nwas significantly reduced on exposure to emodin.   318 \n 319 \n 15 \nThe interspecific differences in sensitivity to the two naphthoquinones may be explained by 320 \nthe feeding habits of the four species, and the consequent degree of soil contact which each 321 \nspecies is subject to.  F. candida, E. albidus and E. fetida all burrow in the soil, and ingest 322 \nmicro-organisms, organic matter, or soil and will therefore ingest the chemicals incorporated 323 \ninto the soil.  In contrast, H. aculeifer is a predatory mite feeding on live collembola prey. Its 324 \npredominant exposure routes are likely to be through the chemical residue remaining in the 325 \ncollembola prey, and through soil contact via absorption through thin areas of the cuticle, with 326 \nnegligible direct ingestion of the chemicals themselves.  This difference may explain their 327 \nlower sensitivity, but does not explain the differences observed in response to the 328 \nanthraquinones described above. This theory could only be confirmed by further experiments 329 \nanalysing the uptake of chemicals within the individuals exposed.  It must also be noted that 330 \nthe survival of predatory mites in the control and solvent controls was lower than the control 331 \nsurvival of the other three species tested. We do not have an explanation for this poor survival 332 \nrate but it is possible that high mortality in the controls could have affected the overall 333 \nvalidity of the test for this species.  334 \n 335 \nIt was not possible to locate any comparative invertebrate toxicity data for naphthoquinones 336 \nor anthraquinones. However, there are studies investigating the relative sensitivity of soil 337 \ninvertebrate species to other toxic chemicals. In most cases collembolans were found to be 338 \nmore sensitive than earthworms in terms of survival and reproduction with enchytraeids the 339 \nleast sensitive of the three to cadmium (Bierkens et al., 1998) polycyclic aromatic 340 \nhydrocarbons (Sverdrup et al., 2002) and antibacterial agents (Jensen et al., 2003). As far as 341 \nwe know there have been no studies comparing the relative sensitivity of predatory mites with 342 \nother soil invertebrates under individual species tests. However, more complex food web 343 \nexposures to metal and organic contaminants have generally shown low sensitivity of 344 \n 16 \nH. aculeifer, compared with enchytraeids, but similar sensitivity to collembola (Cortet et al., 345 \n2006; Pernin et al., 2006; Scott-Fordsmand et al., 2008). These studies are likely to produce 346 \ndifferent results to single species tests as species interactions and chemical toxicity to the 347 \nmites prey will play a role in their sensitivity, in contrast to our test where unlimited prey 348 \nwere supplied. 349 \n 350 \nComparison of natural and synthetic chemical pairs 351 \nThe focus of this study was to compare the toxicity of structurally similar compounds.  352 \nOverall, the toxicity within the chemical pairs was broadly similar for both lethal and sub-353 \nlethal endpoints. The exception was earthworm reproduction which was differentially 354 \nsensitive to both the naphthoquinone  and anthraquinone pairs, with the natural toxin emodin 355 \nand the synthetic toxin 1,4-naphthoquinone being more toxic than their respective analogues.   356 \n 357 \nFor the naphthoquinones, the slight difference in the structures of the two naphthoquinones 358 \ncould be responsible for the difference in toxicity. Quinones, such as 1,4-naphthaquinone, act 359 \nas redox cyclers creating oxidative stress within the organism. Studies with quinones, 360 \nincluding 1,4-naphthaquinone, have shown that the addition of an electron-donating group, 361 \nsuch as the hydroxyl group on juglone, makes the quinone a weaker oxidising agent and 362 \ntherefore less toxic (Schultz et al., 1997). Given that the two chemicals appear to affect 363 \nsurvival in the same way it would appear that 1,4-naphthaquinone has a specific effect on 364 \nreproduction which may be caused by the absence of the hydroxy group (Schultz et al., 1997). 365 \n 366 \nThe higher toxicity of emodin compared with quinizarin, to earthworm reproduction, could  367 \nalso be due to differences in chemical structure, with emodin containing an additional 368 \nhydroxyl and methyl group. Although this is contrary to published evidence which suggests 369 \n 17 \nthat the presence of additional hydroxy groups on substituted quinones may reduce toxicity 370 \n(Schultz et al., 1997). In addition, the position of the functional group on a quinone may also 371 \naffect toxicity. Schultz et al. (1997) reported lower toxicity in methyl- and methoxy- 372 \nbenzoquinones with a 2,5-substitution than those with a 2,6-substitution. These effects were 373 \nreported to be due to stereo-electronic disturbance in the 2,5-substitution, which may not have 374 \nbeen present in the 2,6-substitution. Such effects could be responsible for the lower toxicity of 375 \nquinizarin. In addition, the presence of the methyl group, as an electron accepting moiety on 376 \nemodin, may also be responsible for the greater toxicity of this substance.  377 \n 378 \nConclusion 379 \nData generated in this study revealed that natural and synthetic chemicals which were 380 \nstructurally similar, had similar toxic effects on lethal and sub- lethal endpoints for three out of 381 \nfour soil invertebrates tested.  This would indicate that data on natural chemicals could be 382 \nuseful as a predictive tool for looking at chemical toxicity to a suite of species. However, the 383 \ndifferential effect of the chemicals on earthworm reproduction demonstrates that this 384 \napproach may not be protective of all species. Differences in toxicity identified in the present 385 \nstudy may be related to degree of exposure and\/or subtle differences in the mode of toxic  386 \naction for the chemicals and species tested.  It may therefore, be possible to predict some 387 \ndifferences by looking at the structures of the compounds to identify functional groups that 388 \nmay infer increased or decreased toxicity in one or other chemical. By developing such 389 \ntechniques it may be possible to use read-across from natural to synthetic chemicals on a 390 \nwider group of compounds. 391 \n 392 \nAcknowledgements 393 \nThis work was funded by the American Chemistry Council (grant number EEE-00-05).   394 \n 18 \nReferences 395 \nBanerjee, S., Magdum, S., Kalena, G.P., Banerji, A., 2001.
