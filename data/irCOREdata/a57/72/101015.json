INTRODUCTION\nThe structure of the 9Be nucleus has long been a matter of\ninterest, in particular the strength of any three-body \u03b1 + \u03b1 + n\ncluster configuration. This possibility has received renewed\nattention recently, since it is believed that in neutron-rich as-\ntrophysical environments, such as a core-collapse supernovae,\nthe three-body reaction \u03b1 + \u03b1 + n \u2192 9Be followed by\n9Be(\u03b1,n)12C may provide a route for building up the heavy\nelements and triggering the r-process [1\u20134]. The first stage\ncan proceed by two routes, either \u03b1 + \u03b1 \u2192 8Be followed\nby 8Be + n \u2192 9Be, or \u03b1 + n \u2192 5He followed by 5He +\n\u03b1 \u2192 9Be. In the absence of any experimental evidence for\nthe 5He + \u03b1 configuration, calculations are invariably done\nassuming only the 8Be + n route, the argument being that\nthe different lifetimes of the 8Be and 5He intermediate states\n(10\u221216s and 10\u221221s, respectively) should favor the former.\nHowever, calculating the rate properly requires a knowledge\nof the relative strength of the 8Be + n and 5He + \u03b1 cluster\nconfigurations in 9Be. The key states in this context are those\njust above the particle threshold, in particular those at Ex =\n1.684 MeV (1\/2+) and 2.429 MeV (5\/2\u2212), see Fig. 1.\nPrevious calculations of the three-body rate [6\u20139] assumed\nthat the reaction proceeded only via the 8Be0+ + n channel\n*Present address: iThemba LABS, PO Box 722, Somerset West\n7129, South Africa.\n\u2020Present address: CENPA, Box 354290, University of Washington,\nSeattle, WA 98115, USA.\nand through the various low-lying states in 9Be. Several recent\ntheoretical studies have explored the cluster configuration for\nthese states using microscopic cluster model calculations [10,\n11]. The cluster models include two two-body configurations,\n8Be + n and 5He + \u03b1, and also allow the possibility of the\n8Be being in the broad J\u03c0 = 2+ state at Ex = 3.04 MeV. A\ncommon feature of the model calculations is that the 5He + \u03b1\nconfiguration is important even for the low-lying states and\nindeed becomes dominant at higher excitation energies.\nFollowing a recent measurement of 9C \u03b2-decay [12], which\nshowed that the analogues to some of the 9Be states had\nlarge 5Li widths, Buchmann et al. [13] recalculated the rate\nincluding the 5He + \u03b1 and 8Be2+ + n channels. While\nthe latter was suggested not to play an important role, the\nformer had a considerable effect on the reaction rate at higher\ntemperatures. In a separate reevaluation by Sumiyoshi et al.\n[14], to incorporate revised neutron widths, these authors also\ndrew attention to the need to consider the 5He + \u03b1 channel.\nHowever, as the authors of both calculations point out, this is\nhampered by a severe lack of experimental information on the\npartial widths for the various channels.\nIn a recent investigation [15], Grigorenko and Zhukov\ninclude the 5He + \u03b1 channel and find that it only makes a\nsmall contribution. Note that 93\u201395% of the strength proceeds\n\u201cdemocratically\u201d and the 8Be2+ + n is not considered in this\nwork. The democratic decay has been investigated by several\nauthors [16,17] as an alternative route to the sequential decay.\nExperimental information on the cluster configurations in\n9Be have come from break-up measurements, i.e., studies of\nthe decay of the states in 9Be to the \u03b1 + \u03b1 + n channel.

The low-lying excited states in 9Be derived from proton\nscattering measurements made by Dixit et al. [5]. The states at Ex =\n2.429 and 6.380 MeV are part of the ground state rotational band.\nexcited 9Be states have been prepared in various ways, recent\nexamples include through \u03b2-decay [18], in scattering reactions\n[19] or by photodisintegration [20]. Most measurements\nconfirm that the 2.429 MeV state has a branching ratio\nto the 8Be0+ + n channel of about 7% [21,22], but cannot\ndetermine whether the remaining strength is in the 8Be2+ + n\nor 5He + \u03b1 channels. It is however reported in [23], with no\njustification, that a ratio of 2:1 can be accounted for the two\nchannels, respectively. The main problem is that because the\ndecays are below threshold, the energy shared between the\nthree particles is small and with this restricted phase space the\nkinematics for decay through the two configurations are identi-\ncal, i.e., the energy correlations between the decay particles are\nthe same irrespective of the intermediate step in the decay [24].\nThis is certainly the case in inclusive measurements (i.e., where\nonly \u03b1-particle singles or neutron singles are measured) but\nis also the case in exclusive measurements where coincident\ndetection of the decay particles is achieved. This was nicely\nillustrated in calculations shown in [25].\nIn this paper we have carried out an exclusive measurement\nof the breakup of 9Be excited through inelastic scattering\nand show that by exploring another aspect of the correlation\nbetween the decay particles, the angular correlation, this\nrestriction can be removed. This approach has recently been\nused to investigate \u03b2-delayed breakup from 9Be [18], although\nthis measurement did not include the 2.429 MeV state (because\nof the \u03b2-decay selection rules only low spin, negative parity\nstates can be populated). This has enabled us, for the first\ntime, to show that the remaining strength in the decay of the\n2.429 MeV state is to the 8Be2+ + n channel and that the partial\nwidth of the 5He + \u03b1 channel is very small.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL METHOD AND ANALYSIS\nThe experiment was performed using the 14UD pelletron\ntandem accelerator at the Australian National University\nduring April 2003. The experiment was designed to study\nthe inelastic scattering of 6Li nuclei from a 9Be target and the\nsubsequent breakup of the excited 9Be nuclei. The detection\ntechnique for this experiment required that the 6Li recoils\nwere detected and identified. By also detecting and identifying\nthe two corresponding break-up \u03b1 particles for each break-up\nFIG. 2. The experimental setup.\nevent, it is then possible to reconstruct the missing momentum\nof the undetected neutron. The reaction kinematics should then\nbe fully defined, allowing the complete reconstruction of the\nbreak-up event and identification of the state in 9Be that was\npopulated. A 6Li beam at Elab = 60 MeV was focused onto a\n9Be target (256 \u00b5g\/cm2). Data were taken for approximately\n92 hrs with a beam current of between Ibeam \u2248 2\u20135 enA.\nFor the purposes of detecting the particles arising from the\nbreakup of 9Be, four position sensitive silicon-strip detectors\n(PSSSDs) were used. Two detector telescopes, both consisting\nof the combination of a silicon quadrant detector (\u2248 65 \u00b5m\nthick) mounted in front of a PSSSD (\u2248 500 \u00b5m thick), were\nused to detect and identify the recoil lithium particles. Figure\n2 illustrates the setup inside the experimental chamber. The\nposition of the detectors relative to the target are indicated\ntherein and were chosen based on efficiency results obtained\nfrom Monte Carlo simulations.\nEvents comprising a 6Li in one of the telescopes, identified\nfrom the characteristic locus in a E\u0004E plot, coincident with\ntwo hits in the strip detectors were selected for analysis.\nEvents where two adjacent strips fired were rejected, since\nsuch signals can be produced by a single particle entering\nan interstrip gap on the detector and inducing a signal on\nthe adjacent strips. Assuming that the two strip detector hits\nwere \u03b1 particles, the missing momentum and energy of the\nneutron could be calculated and hence the Total final state\nKinetic Energy (TKE) determined (ETKE = E\u03b11 + E\u03b12 +\nEn + E6Li). A clear peak is observed in the TKE spectrum\nat an energy of ETKE = 58.3 MeV, which is consistent with\nthe beam energy of Elab = 60 MeV, minus the Q-value for\nbreakup (Q = \u22121.57 MeV) and the energy loss in the target\n(EL \u2248 100 keV). Gating on this peak ensures that we select\non genuine \u03b1 + \u03b1 + n break-up events.\nHaving now selected the required events, we can calculate\nthe relative energy E\u03b1\u03b1 between the \u03b1 particles. This is shown\nin Fig. 3 and reveals three distinct features. The narrow peak\nat E\u03b1\u03b1 = 92 keV (Q-value of 8Be breakup) corresponds to\nbreakup via the 8Be0+ . The broad peak at around E\u03b1\u03b1 \u2248 3 MeV\ncorresponds to the decay of excited states in 9Be with an\nexcitation energy Ex > 5 MeV. It has been shown in previous\nwork that the 5He + \u03b1 channel contributes significantly at\nhigher excitation energy [26,27]. The broad distribution can\nreflect two contributions; breakup via the J\u03c0 = 2+ first excited\nstate in 8Be and breakup via the J\u03c0 = 3\/2\u2212 ground state in\n5He.\n045803-2\nDECAY PATH MEASUREMENTS FOR THE 2.429 MeV . . .

The shape would reflect a complex interplay\nbetween the decreasing strength in the low energy tail of the\nstate (favoring higher energies) and the phase space (favoring\nlower energies). Gating on these features in the E\u03b1\u03b1 spectrum\nenables us to identify which states in 9Be decay to particular\nchannels. Figure 4(a) illustrates the 9Be excitation energy\nspectrum reconstructed for 8Be0+ events and Fig. 4(b) that for\nthe \u201cbump\" at E\u03b1\u03b1 \u2248 600 keV. The former shows excitation\nof the known states in 9Be indicated by the three-Gaussian fit\non the spectrum showing the contributions of the states at Ex =\n1.68, 2.429, and 3.05 MeV.\nDue to the width of the states and the intrinsic resolution,\nthe fit of Fig. 4(a) is not trivial. The width and position\nof the 2.429 MeV peak is deduced from the fit of Fig. 4(b)\nand the only free parameter for this Gaussian in Fig. 4(a) is\nthe weight.

The background results from a fit\nfor excitation energy between Ex = 4\u20138 MeV extrapolated to\nlower excitation energy. This background includes the broad\nstates at Ex = 4.7 and around 6.38 MeV, and a flat component\nvanishing to zero at Ex = 1.6 MeV.\nWhen the selection is made on the 600 keV bump,\nthe spectrum in Fig. 4(b) is seen, illustrating a dominant\ncontribution from the state at Ex = 2.429 MeV. Events which\nbreakup via the 2.78\/3.05 MeV states have been identified in\nthe high energy tail of the Gaussian. They were deconvoluted\nwith a two-Gaussian fit and are estimated to account for\napproximately 7\u00b11% of the events in the 600 keV bump.\nNote that events corresponding to the neutron transfer reaction\n9Be(6Li,7Li\u2217)8Be\u2217 \u2192 6Li + n + 2\u03b1, which has an identical\nQ-value, could fall within the TKE window. The excitation\nenergy in 7Li has been reconstructed and only the first excited\nstate above the neutron threshold has been identified at Ex =\n7.459 MeV. This contamination appears in the spectrum only\nat high excitation energy and can be removed with appropriate\nselections.\nIII. INTERPRETATION OF THE RESULTS\nA. The simulation code\nFor the purposes of identifying the kinematic signatures of\nthe different decay channels, a Monte Carlo code SIMSORT [28]\nhas been written which simulates the inelastic scattering of\nthe 6Li beam from the 9Be target, the subsequent breakup\nof the 9Be nuclei and the detector response to the exit\nchannel particles. The user can define the exact nature of\nthe break-up path for the purposes of a simulation: the\nexcited state populated in 9Be and whether breakup occurs\nvia 8Be0+ ,8 Be2+ , or 5Heg.s.. SIMSORT assumes an isotropic\ncenter-of-mass (c.m.) distribution for each of the break-up\nstages, although an anisotropy can be introduced (see next\nsection). However, the scattering distribution for the 6Li recoils\nused in the code was derived from the experimental results\nand reconstructed from the two telescopes. The code also\ncontains details of the detector setup, threshold detection\nenergies, the expected energy resolution for the silicon\ndetectors (FWHM \u2248 200 keV), the position resolution of the\nPSSSDs (FWHM \u2248 0.5 mm across a strip), etc. For the sake\nof consistency with the analysis of the real data, SIMSORT\nuses an identical data sort process, i.e., events detected in\nadjacent PSSSD strips are rejected, identical gates are applied,\n\u03b1 particles are randomly labeled 1 and 2, etc.\nFigure 5 illustrates a velocity vector diagram of the break-up\nparticles and intermediate 8Be and 5He resonances in the\n9Be c.m. frame. The solid lines represent the decay paths\nvia the 8Be2+ + n channel and the dotted and dashed lines\nvia the two solutions of the 5He + \u03b1 channel. The relative\nenergies between particles can be calculated as follows: Erel =\nM\u00b5V\n2\nrel\/2 where Vrel is the velocity vector measured between\nthe particles and M\u00b5 is the reduced mass. The energy available\nfor each decay depends upon the excitation energy Ex of\nthe parent state and the Q-value of the resulting decay\nchannel.

Illustration of the angles \u03b81 and \u03b82 used to establish angu-\nlar correlations for breakup via the 5Heg.s. and the 8Be2+ resonances.\nThe diagram is drawn in the 9Be c.m. frame and represents the 8Be2+\n+ n (solid) and 5Heg.s. + \u03b1 (dotted and dashed) channels. The grey\ncircles represent the intermediate resonances and the white circles\nthe final break-up particles. The relative energies summed in each of\nthe three decays are consistent with the available energy Ea = Ex +\nQ = 0.858 MeV.\nin their c.m. frame can also be written Erel = Ex + Q.\nThe Q-values for the first stage of sequential 9Be breakup\nare Q = \u22121.665 and \u22122.467 MeV for decay via 8Be\nand 5He, respectively. For breakup to the 8Be2+ state this\nQ-value is effectively 3 MeV lower. Given an excitation\nenergy of Ex = 2.429 MeV, breakup to the 5Heg.s. (\u0005 =\n648 keV) and the 8Be2+ (\u0005 = 1.5 MeV) states is only possible\ndue to the broad width of these intermediate states. The\nrelative energy between the particles in the first step emission\nthus depends on the penetrability of the particle through the\nCoulomb and\/or centrifugal barrier and the phase space defined\nby the state in the residual nucleus, we return to this point later.\nThe vector diagram, see Fig. 5, shows a specific decay for\nan available energy equally shared between the two stages of\nthe breakup. The kinematics is identical for the two channels\nand the relative energy at each stage of the decay can span\nfrom Erel = 0 to Ea , with the condition that the sum of the\nrelative energies is equal to Ea the available energy. As a\nconsequence, there is no obvious signature for either the 5Heg.s.\nor the 8Be2+ decay channel which could be expected in the\n\u03b1-5He (E\u03b15He) or n-8Be (En8Be) relative energy spectra.\nHowever, the existence of angular correlations may provide\na solution for distinguishing the two different break-up paths.\nB. Angular correlations\nThe following multistep angular correlation formalism\nis described in detail by Biedenharn and Rose [29], and\nhas been used successfully to assign spins for 9Be and 9B\nstates studied using \u03b2-delayed breakup [30]. The following\nanalysis is based on the same approach. The emission of\nparticles in cascade from the same nucleus yields a correlation\nbetween their relative propagation directions.

Most of the application require the extreme\nvalues for the correlation but the two possible combinations of\nspin and angular momentum interfere and the A0,2 parameters\nshould be calculated accordingly. The b\u03bd(ll) coefficients are\ncalculated following Eq. (3). For the case of the state at Ex =\n2.429 MeV (5\/2\u2212) the correlation function reduces to the\nfollowing form for breakup via 5Heg.s. and 8Be2+ channels:\nW (\u03b8 ) = A0 + 12A2(3cos2\u03b8\u22121). (5)\nThis 3D probability distribution for \u03b8 can be projected in\n1D by multiplying Eq. (5) by sin\u03b8 . By incorporating the 3D\nprobability distribution for \u03b8 into SIMSORT, thereby introducing\nan anisotropy into the c.m. break-up distribution, the W (\u03b8 )\nprofile can be compared with the distribution reconstructed\nfrom experimental data.\nC. 8Be0+ + n breakup\nThe measurement of the breakup via 8Be0+ is straightfor-\nward due to the narrow peak at E\u03b1\u03b1 = 92 keV corresponding\nto the ground state of the unbound 8Be. The deconvolution\nof the three states in Fig. 4(a) reveals that 11 \u00b1 2% of\nthe 2.429 MeV state decays via 8Be0+ . This measurement is\nconsistent with previous results reported in [21,22], though it\nis slightly higher. However, a different method applied on\nthe same data [27] gives a ratio of 6 \u00b1 1% which is in\nperfect agreement with [21,22]. The former result should not\nbe considered accurate due to a nontrivial deconvolution of the\nbroad states in the low excitation energy region of Fig. 4(a).\nD. 8Be2+ + n breakup\nAs alluded to earlier, the En8Be profile to be used for the\nsimulation is very important. The penetrability, P (E), has\nbeen calculated including simply the centrifugal barrier when\nemitting a neutron with an energy En8Be = 0 to 0.76 MeV.\nThis distribution is folded with the Lorentzian shape of the\n8Be2+ state and the penetrability of the two \u03b1 particles through\nthe Coulomb and centrifugal barriers in the 8Be2+ decay. The\nresult of this calculation is shown in Fig. 6 (solid lines) for\nthe two possible values of l1. However, such a calculation\nmight not be relied upon as more sophisticated considerations\nwould be required including the possible interference with the\noverlapping states. Therefore, we used the experimental data\nto deduce the best En8Be profile by adjusting the shape used in\nthe simulation to reproduce the measurements.\nE\u03b1\u03b1 does not depend on the \u03b81 angular distribution at\nthe first step emission in the 8Be + n exit channel. As\na consequence, the direction taken by the neutron has no\ninfluence on the E\u03b1\u03b1 relative energy as the 8Be decays at the\nsecond step of the decay. The E\u03b1\u03b1 spectrum is reconstructed\nin the 8Be c.m. frame and is only altered by the experimental\nset-up response. Therefore, it is possible to extract from the\nsimulation the energy distribution required for the first step\n [deg]1\u03b8\n0 50 100 150\nCo\nun\nts\n\/d\neg\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\n700\nFIG. 7.

This profile is then used to perform the complete\nsimulation of the reaction and all parameters deduced from\nexperimental data are reproduced in the simulation.\nThe histogram of Fig. 6 is the result of the adjustment which\nis fairly close to the calculation (solid curve) for l1 = 1. The\nbarrier is seen around Eb \u2248 250 keV and the maximum energy\nis close to the available energy Ea =Ex +Q= 0.76 MeV. Now\nthat we have the correct profile for the relative energy in the\nsimulation, we can compare the predicted angular correlations\nto the measured ones. Figure 7 illustrates a 1D distribution plot\nreconstructed from experimental data (solid). A larger energy\ngate on the 9Be excitation energy of \u0004Ex = 400 keV has been\nused on this occasion to boost the statistics.\nThe A0,2 parameters of Eq. (5) have been calculated using\nEq. (2) assuming breakup via the 8Be2+ state and including\nthe initial spin of the 2.429 MeV state J\u03c0 = 5\/2\u2212(\u00b11\/2).\nWe assumed that the spin distribution of j1 is equally\nshared between the two values j1 = 2 and 3. The predicted\ndistribution, W (\u03b8 ), defined by the resulting parameters A0 =\n0.848 and A2 = \u22120.302, is plotted in Fig. 7 (dotted) and is\na very good reproduction of the experimental distribution. A\nfit was also performed to quantify the spin distribution. The\nresult suggests that 65 \u00b1 1% of the events decay via spin\nj1 = 2. The Legendre polynomial parameters, in this case,\nare found to be A0 = 0.783 and A2 = \u22120.433. This ratio\nshould not be considered accurate as we omitted to include the\nl1 = 3 orbital angular momentum in the fit. It shows, however,\nthat the assumption of an equally shared spin distribution is\nacceptable.\nThis result suggests that the vast majority of the break-up\nevents that populate the 2.429 MeV state, with E\u03b1\u03b1 > 200 keV,\nbreakup via the 8Be2+ state.\nE. 5He + \u03b1 breakup\nThe fact that the experimental energy and angular distribu-\ntions can be understood using the 8Be2+ + n channel alone is\nnot in itself sufficient evidence that the 5He + \u03b1 channel does\n045803-5\nP. PAPKA et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW C 75, 045803 (2007)\nnot contribute. However, in this section, we show that any such\ncontribution must be small, otherwise discrepancies with the\nmeasured angular correlations would arise. Unfortunately, two\ncomplications arise when analyzing this channel: uncertainty\nover which \u03b1 particle is correlated with the neutron, which in\nturn leads to a lack of knowledge of the first stage break-up\nrelative energy and angular distributions. These points are\ndiscussed below.\nAs mentioned earlier, the choice of the \u03b1 particle used to\nreconstruct an event is random. As a consequence approx-\nimately 50% of the experimental data will be incorrectly\nreconstructed assuming the identity of the break-up path is\nunknown. However, this choice is crucial for the correct re-\nconstruction of the E\u03b15He and \u03b82 distributions. In a simulation,\nthe incorrect \u03b1 particle will be chosen to reconstruct the 5He\nnucleus for approximately half of the simulated events. The\nresulting distributions, produced by SIMSORT, will therefore\nconsist of an approximately 50\/50 mix of events that have been\ncorrectly and incorrectly reconstructed as expected for real\nevents.\nTo ensure a fair comparison between the simulated and\nexperimental data, the E\u03b15He distribution for simulated events\nmust be a good reproduction of the real distribution recon-\nstructed assuming breakup via 5He. Therefore, an accurate\ndescription of the E\u03b1\u03b1 energy profile should yield an accurate\ndescription of E\u03b15He. However, in the case of the 5Heg.s.\nevents, the E\u03b1\u03b1 profile depends also upon the break-up angular\ndistribution of the neutron, which is responsible for giving a\nrecoil kick to the \u03b1 particle emitted in the second stage of the\nbreakup.\nIn the previous section, we are able to analyze the 8Be2+ + n\nchannel by using the experimental data to constrain the relative\nenergy, but this is not possible for the 5He + \u03b1 channel.\nTherefore the analysis has to be carried out with assumptions\non \u03b82. Using Eq. (5), the parameters of the W (\u03b8 ) function\nare predicted to be A0 = 0.737 and A2 = \u22120.526. Using\nthose parameters, the E\u03b15He profile can be extracted from the\nsimulation using the same method. The resulting distribution\nis shown in Fig. 8 (histogram) which reproduces with a\ngood agreement the 1D projections reconstructed in both\nchannels.\n [MeV]He5\u03b1E\n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1\nP  \n[ar\nb. \nun\nits\n]\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\nFIG. 8.

The distribution obtained\nfrom simulation is normalized to the calculation for comparison.\nThe penetrability function is calculated as previously\ndescribed for the 8Be2+ + n decay. The Coulomb barrier is\nnow included, the centrifugal barrier is calculated for l1 = 2\nand the resulting penetrability is folded with the phase space in\nthe residual 5Heg.s.. There is a striking difference between the\ncalculation, shown in Fig. 8 (solid curve), and the E\u03b15He profile\nobtained from the simulation (histogram). The position of the\n600 keV bump can be understood by means of the 5He + \u03b1\nchannel only if the E\u03b15He distribution lies at higher energy than\npredicted by the calculation. This is consistent with previous\nwork [25] where the 600 keV bump is shifted to lower energy\nwhen simulating the 5He + \u03b1 channel using the formalism\nof [22].\nThe comparison between the calculation and the relative\nenergy tends to show that the 5He + \u03b1 channel is unlikely.\nHowever, such a conclusion should be drawn carefully. As\nalready mentioned in the previous section, possible interfer-\nence with neighboring broad states should be included in the\ncalculations which could lead to different result. In order to\ninvestigate the possible contribution of the 5He + \u03b1 channel,\nwe have carried out an analysis of the energy dependence\nof \u03b81.\nThe 2D spectra E\u03b1\u03b1 versus \u03b81 in Figs. 9(a) and 9(b) show a\nstriking inconsistency when the 5He + \u03b1 channel is simulated.\nThe discrepancy is shown in Figs. 9(c) and 9(d) where 1D\nprojections of \u03b81 are plotted with selections on E\u03b1\u03b1 .

Using the values of\nA0,2 parameters, considering the 5He + \u03b1 channel, we see in\nFig. 9(d) that the angular distribution splits in two components\nfor E\u03b1\u03b1 < 0.4 MeV. Effectively, the lowest part of the E\u03b1\u03b1\nspectrum is populated for \u03b82 \u2248 180\u25e6 which populates the two\ncomponents at small and large \u03b81. This is inconsistent with\nthe experimental data. The A0,2 parameters are successful in\nreproducing the 1D projection, but then result in a discrepancy\nwith the 2D projections, especially E\u03b1\u03b1 vs \u03b81. We have carried\nout checks to ensure that the above assumption is robust against\nuncertainties in the angular correlation function, even though\nwe have no reason to doubt the theoretical ones. It has been\nconcluded that more isotropic angular correlation functions\ncannot satisfactorily reproduce the E\u03b1\u03b1 distribution.\nIn order to estimate the possible 5He + \u03b1 strength we tried\nto deconvolute the two components in the \u03b81 distribution with\nthe condition 0.15 MeV < E\u03b1\u03b1 < 0.35 MeV. But, as shown\nin Fig. 9, \u03b81 measured in the experimental data has no energy\ndependence and the contribution of 5He can only be buried in\nthe statistical fluctuations. In this way, an upper limit of 2.5%\ncan be estimated for the 5He + \u03b1 channel.\nIV. DISCUSSION\nThe microscopic cluster model calculations of Descouve-\nmont [10] provide partial widths for the two-body configura-\ntions for the low lying states of the mirror nuclei 9Be and 9B. In\norder to compare these to experiment, the given widths have\nto be folded with the decay penetrability appropriate to the\ngiven channel. This is presented in Table II where we compare\nthe theoretical predictions with the experimentally observed\nstrengths. In agreement with the experiment, the main strength\nis predicted to decay via the 8Be2+ + n channel. However,\nthe partial width of the 5He + \u03b1 channel is overestimated\ncompared with the upper limit estimated to be \u0005 < 2.5% and\nprobably much smaller. On the other hand, the 8Be0+ + n\npartial width is underestimated with a factor of nearly 10. The\nratio measured in previous work of \u2248 7% indicates a stronger\n8Be0+ + n configuration of the 2.429 MeV state. This can be\nunderstood as this state is part of the rotational band based\non the ground state expected, in the same reference, to have a\ndominant 8Be0+ + n cluster configuration.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nIn this paper we have made measurements of the partial\ndecay width for the 2.429 MeV state in 9Be which is relevant\nfor the astrophysically important three-body \u03b1 + \u03b1 + n\nreaction.\nThe partial width of the 8Be0+ + n channel has been\nmeasured and found consistent with previous work. The\ndistinction between 8Be2+ + n and 5Heg.s. + \u03b1 channels has\nbeen made possible by an exclusive measurement, detecting\nand analyzing three particle events in a break-up reaction. The\ncontribution of the \u201cdemocratic\u201d decay was not considered in\nthis work.\nThe measurements show that the 5He + \u03b1 channel is not\nimportant for this state, although it is for higher states, see\n[26,27], but that the main decay is through the tail of the\nbroad J\u03c0 = 2+ state in 8Be. A lack of counts in the present\nmeasurement precludes the same analysis being applied to\nthe other two low-lying states, but with increased statistics it\nshould be possible.\nThe present results indicate that the 8Be2+ +n configuration\nis important in 9Be and so should be included in any calculation\nof the \u03b1 + \u03b1 + n reaction rate. The recent study by Prezado\n[18] showed it is also important for the next higher state at\nEx = 2.78 MeV, which also has an appreciable 5He + \u03b1\nconfiguration.\nHowever, this poses a considerable theoretical challenge,\nsince in both cases the intermediate states are broad and the\nusual narrow-resonance formalism cannot be applied. Some\nwork in this direction has been reported recently [15,31] which\nsuggests a small influence of the broad 8Be2+ and 5Heg.s.\nresonances. But, until rigorous calculations are available, it\nwill not be possible to determine the extent to which these\nother configurations influence the astrophysical systems. This\ntheoretical challenge needs to be addressed and, until it is,\ncalculations of the \u03b1 + \u03b1 + n reaction rate should be treated\nwith caution.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe would like to acknowledge P.
