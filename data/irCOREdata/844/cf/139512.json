In some cases, such as in regions of\nstrong viscous-inviscid interaction, shock waves can be un-\nsteady and result in fluctuating loads that need to be pre-\ndicted in many aerospace applications.1 Most previous stud-\nies on shock unsteadiness have relied on high-speed wall\npressure measurements to estimate the location where the\nshock is in contact with a surface.2,3 This limitation may be\novercome by optical techniques, but their application to\nhigh-speed flows can be restricted by the high sampling fre-\nquencies required to measure the shock positions. Previous\noptical-based methods have used a schlieren technique with\na laser diode light source and a spatial filter to obtain time-\ndependent voltage signals sensitive to the density gradients\nand measured through an array of 16 photodiodes at acqui-\nsition speeds of up to 40 kHz.4\nThis paper presents a modified schlieren method incor-\nporating the latest light-emitting diode \u0001LED\u0002 technology\nand digital imaging systems, which determine the location of\nthe shock position at frequencies in excess of the shock tran-\nsients. The associated image processing methods are also\npresented, which allow accurate location of the shock posi-\ntion and analysis of the transient properties of the shock.\nThe schlieren technique is an optical diagnostic com-\nmonly used in supersonic and hypersonic wind tunnel test-\ning. It is based on the principle of refraction, which depends\non the change in local fluid density.5 Schlieren visualizations\ndiscriminate aerodynamic features present in the flow such as\nshock waves and boundary layers as brighter and darker re-\ngions in the image.6 High-speed schlieren is an advanced\nvariance of this technique, which consists in obtaining time-\nresolved visualizations that provide information on the un-\nsteady flow features. In applications to high-speed flows, this\ngenerally requires the use of a capturing device at high frame\nrates with short exposure times. Thus high intensity and in-\ncoherent light sources are required.7,8 The main limitation of\nhigh-speed schlieren systems to date has been obtaining a\nsuitable light source, which must be synchronized with the\ncapturing device.9\nThe present arrangement \u0001Fig. 1\u0002 has made use of the\nlatest technology high-power LED light source \u00013 W CREE\nQ5\u0002 in a continuous mode and in combination with direct\nimaging onto a high-speed digital camera \u0001Photron APX\u0002.\nBy using the light source in a continuous mode, a relatively\nsimple system has been obtained. The system has been\ndeveloped in the Cranfield University 2.5\u0001\u00012.5\u0001 Super-\nFIG. 1.

The high-speed\ncamera has been operated at a frame rate of 10 000 frames \/s\nand with an image resolution of 512 pixels \u0001width\u0002\n\u0001256 pixels \u0001height\u0002, corresponding to 12 pixels\/mm. The\nschlieren image has been captured directly onto the chip of\nthe camera and polarized filters have been used to avoid\nimage overexposure. Eight-bit images have been captured on\na gray scale, with a time lapse of 100 \u0002s between images. A\nhorizontal knife edge has been used to obtain the first deriva-\ntive of vertical density gradients.\nA typical schlieren image is shown in Fig. 2, where the\nmain features of the flow field are highlighted including the\nboundary layer and the reflected and impinging shocks. A\nreference distance y \/\u0003 is indicated, where y is the vertical\ndistance from the wall and \u0003 is the boundary layer thickness.\nIn order to quantify the shock wave positions, a number\nof image processing algorithms were developed to extract\nthe required information from the images. The shock loca-\ntion is discernible as distinct dark or light regions in com-\nparison with the background light intensity. Other flow fea-\ntures such as boundary layers or expansion regions are more\ngradual but also visible.10\nA version of the Canny algorithm was applied to locate\nthe shock positions. This algorithm is an edge detection\nmethod of common use in machine vision applications.11 A\nresult of the algorithm\u2019s application is shown in Fig. 3. It was\nfound to give enhanced performance in comparison with\nsimpler edge detectors \u0001Sobel, Prewitt, Roberts, and Laplace\u0002\nwhen locating the shock position. This was mainly due to its\nreduced sensitivity to noise and its edge-thinning capability,\nwhich provided a clear shock location and avoided detection\nof unwanted edges. Shock position was determined by ap-\nplying a suitable threshold to isolate the highest intensity\ngradients in the image, which once in binary form allowed\nthe shocks to be distinguished as thin edges.12,13 From\nthese edges the locations of the shocks were identified\nfor each row in the image digital matrix \u0001256\u0001512\u0002.

Shock unsteadiness was subsequently analyzed in\ndifferent regions of the flow. In each case, sets of 1024\ntime-correlated schlieren images were taken at a frame rate\nof 10000 frames \/s, giving an effective bandwidth of up to\n5 kHz.\nA typical time series of the location of the two shocks\nstudied in the present application shows that the impinging\nshock is practically steady, whereas the position of the re-\nflected shock changes with time \u0001Fig. 4\u0002. The same plot also\nshows that the displacement of the reflected shock at loca-\ntions upstream and downstream of the incident shock \u0001B and\nC, respectively, in Fig. 2\u0002 is in coherence most of the time.\nThe corresponding spectral analysis of the reflected shock is\nshown in Fig. 5. With reference to these results and the im-\nage in Fig. 2, based on two independent sets of 1024 images\nand a frequency resolution of 9.8 Hz, measurements have\nshown frequency peaks at approximately 150 Hz at locations\nB and C. This is in agreement with previous wall pressure\nmeasurements at the location of the reflected shock\u2019s foot,\nwhich identified such unsteadiness to be in the order of\n102 Hz in similar studies.2,3\nThe method presented has therefore proven to be a reli-\nable optical flow diagnostic for studies on shock wave un-\nsteadiness. Its capability in obtaining flow measurements in\nregions not accessible by intrusive methods has also been\nshown.\n1 D. S.
