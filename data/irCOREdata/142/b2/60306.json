United Kingdom monitoring networks have provided \nmany relevant data sets that are already in the public domain. Specifically, hourly \norganic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) were determined at four sites \nbetween 2003 and 2007 using Rupprecht and Pattashnik (R & P) 5400 automatic \ninstruments. Since 2007, daily OC\/EC measurements have been made by manual \nthermo-optical analysis of filter samples using a Sunset Laboratory Carbon Aerosol \nAnalysis instrument.

The measurement issues \nassociated with these techniques are evaluated in the context of UK measurements, \nmaking use of several sets of parallel data, with the aim of aiding the interpretation of \nnetwork results. From the results available, the main conclusions are that the R & P \n5400 instruments greatly underread EC and total carbon (TC = OC+EC) at kerbside \nsites, probably due to the fact that the smaller particles are not sampled by the \ninstrument; the R & P 5400 instrument is inherently difficult to characterise, so that \nall quantitative results need to be treated with caution; both aethalometer and Black \nSmoke (converted to black carbon) measurements can show reasonable agreement \nwith elemental carbon results; and manual thermo-optical OC\/EC results may \nunderread EC (and hence overread OC), whether either transmittance or reflectance is \nused for the pyrolysis correction, and this effect is significant at rural sites. \n \nKeywords \nBlack Smoke, Black Carbon, Organic Carbon, Elemental Carbon, air quality, UK \n \n1 Introduction \n \nCarbonaceous particles are a major component of airborne particulate matter (PM), \nforming around 40% of average roadside PM10 in the UK, according to AQEG (2005) \nbased on the work of Harrison et al (2003). \nThe analysis of the carbonaceous component of particles has traditionally \ndistinguished between \u201celemental carbon\u201d (EC) and \u201corganic carbon\u201d (OC), where \nthe EC is loosely associated with the terms \u201csoot\u201d and \u201cblack carbon\u201d, and OC is \n2 \n \neverything else. No assumptions are made about the compounds present, with both \nquantities being expressed as the mass of particle-bound carbon in a unit volume of \nair.  In practice the total carbon (TC = EC+OC) on filter samples is relatively well \ndefined and can be measured by the thermal volatilisation of carbonaceous material \ncombined with quantitative detection of the carbon produced, for example using a \nmethanator and a flame ionisation detector. There is a separable issue of whether the \nmaterial collected on filters is representative of carbonaceous material in the ambient \natmosphere, as it is well known that semi-volatile organic compounds, for example, \ncan lead to significant variations in collected material depending on the collection \nconditions (eg Turpin et al, 1993; Eatough et al, 1993). The majority of the methods \ndescribed here are based on filter samples. The control of artifacts is an active area of \nstudy, for example within the ongoing European EUSAAR project. However, the \nissue of sampling artifacts is not the main subject of this paper and will not be \naddressed further. Unlike TC, the OC and EC fractions are operationally defined \nusing semi-empirical methods described in more detail below. \nThe determination of \u201cblack carbon\u201d is based on entirely different physical principles, \nusing optical rather than chemical techniques. Within the United Kingdom, \nmeasurements of Black Smoke Index, based on the reflectance of a daily filter \nsample, have been made since the 1920s. Although expressed in units of \u03bcg\/m3, the \nconvention used to produce the Black Smoke Index (ISO 9835, 1993) means that the \nreported results are very much larger than any determination of EC. More recent \noptical techniques, based on the transmittance of a filter sample, estimate black \ncarbon by using a mass extinction coefficient to give a realistic measure of soot in \n\u03bcg\/m3 (eg Hansen et al., 1984). Quincey (2007) has shown that the two filter-based \noptical methods of Black Smoke and black carbon should give results with a simple \n3 \n \nrelationship between them. Black carbon methods should ideally produce results \nsimilar to measures of EC, though there will always be differences due to the \nvariation of mass extinction coefficient with soot particle size, due to the imperfect \noperational definition of EC, and due to the optical effects of other particulate \ncomponents present.  \nAccurate measurements of the composition of PM are vital to understanding the \nsources and evolution of PM in the atmosphere, and hence to implementing effective \ncontrol measures to reduce its health effects. This is reflected in the requirement for \ncompositional analysis (including EC and OC) in the recent EU Air Quality Directive \n(2008). Determining the health effects of specific components within PM also \nrequires accurate measurements of those components. Aside from health effects, black \ncarbon is also of interest because of its role as a short-lived but strong forcing agent \nfor climate change (eg Shine at al., 2007). It is therefore important that such \nmeasurements as are available from national monitoring networks or elsewhere can be \ncompared and interpreted with adequate knowledge of their strengths and \ndeficiencies.  \nThe results presented here relate primarily to the substantial volume of data available \nfrom the UK Particle and Black Smoke networks, funded by Defra (Department of the \nEnvironment, Food and Rural Affairs). The Particle network measured hourly organic \ncarbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) using Rupprecht and Pattashnik (R & P) \n5400 automatic instruments at four sites between 2002 and 2007. Data from the \nperiod 2002 \u2013 2004 was the subject of a paper by Jones and Harrison (Jones and \nHarrison, 2005). Since 2007, daily OC\/EC measurements have been made by manual \nthermo-optical analysis of filter samples using a Sunset Laboratory Carbon Aerosol \nAnalysis instrument. In parallel, long term daily measurements of Black Smoke have \n4 \n \nbeen made at many sites using the standard Black Smoke method. (ISO 9835, 1993). \nThese instruments are currently being replaced by black carbon instruments (Magee \nAE22 aethalometers).  \n \n2 Measurement methods  \n \n2.1 Manual OC\/EC \n \nDaily samples were collected onto Pallflex Tissuequartz 47mm filters using a Partisol \n2025 sampler fitted with a PM10 inlet and sampling at 1 m3\/hr. The filters are binder-\nfree pure quartz filters that had been heat-treated by the manufacturer to remove trace \norganic compounds. This was checked by routine blank measurements. The filters \nfrom the rural Auchencorth Moss site were an exception, and the quartz filters used \nthere had substantial OC blank content, though not EC, which was the parameter used \nfor this set of results.  After sampling, the filters were returned to NPL and kept in a \nfridge before analysis. 1.5 cm2 punches were then taken from the filter samples and \nanalysed on a Sunset Laboratory Carbon Aerosol Analysis Lab Instrument. The \nprotocol followed was a variation of the NIOSH protocol known as Quartz, which is \ndescribed below. In an oxygen-free helium atmosphere, the sample is heated in four \nincreasing temperature steps to remove organic carbon on the filter: 310\u00baC for 70s, \n475\u00baC for 60s, 615\u00baC for 60s and 870\u00baC for 105s. As the organic compounds are \nvolatilised, they are immediately oxidized to carbon dioxide in an oxidizer oven, \nwhich follows the sample oven. The flow of helium, containing the carbon dioxide, \nthen goes to a methanator oven where the CO2 is reduced to methane. The methane is \nthen detected by a flame ionisation detector (FID). Typically during this helium phase \nsome organic compounds are converted to elemental carbon on the filter by pyrolysis. \n5 \n \nThis pyrolitic conversion was continuously monitored by measuring the transmittance \nor reflectance of the sample using a laser.  \nAfter the sample oven is cooled to 525\u00b0C, the pure helium eluent is switched to a 10% \noxygen\/helium mixture in the sample oven. The sample oven temperature was stepped \nup to 550\u00baC for 60s, 625\u00baC for 60s, 700\u00baC for 60s, 775\u00baC for 60s, and 890\u00b0C for 110s. \nDuring this phase, both the original elemental carbon and that produced by the \npyrolysis of organics during the first phase are oxidized to carbon dioxide. The TC \nvalue is based on the integrated FID response, while the split between OC and EC is \ncalculated by assuming that the pyrolysed OC material has been removed when the \ntransmittance or reflectance returns to its initial value. For technical reasons, in some \ncases both transmittance and reflectance data were available, while in others only \ntransmittance or reflectance data were available. \n  \nAfter each sample run, a known volume and concentration of methane is injected into \nthe sample oven. This provides a means of checking consistent operation of the \ninstrument. The primary calibration of the entire Sunset instrument (for TC) is done \nby putting known amounts of sucrose on filters and analysing them using the full \nQuartz protocol. Machine blanks (every analysis session) and filter blanks (every six \nweeks) are also routinely measured to assess and correct for, if required, trace carbon \ncontamination from the machine or from sampling. The Partisol samplers were \ncalibrated annually for flow using traceable flowmeters, and the results of these \ncalibrations used to produce the retrospectively ratified data sets. \nIt is well known that the determination of the OC and EC fractions can vary \nsignificantly depending on the choices of heating protocol and optical correction, and \nalso that the presence of mineral oxides, for example, can affect the oxidation of \ncarbonaceous material and hence affect the results (Chow et al, 2001; Chow et al, \n6 \n \n2005). These are active areas of study, for example within the EUSAAR project \nmentioned above, that do not directly affect the conclusions formed here, which relate \nto the comparability of existing data sets within UK Networks rather than the much \nbroader topic of OC and EC determination. \n \n2.2 Automatic OC\/EC \n \nThe Rupprecht and Pattashnick (latterly Thermo) 5400 Ambient Carbon Particulate \nMonitor collected hourly samples through a PM10 inlet operating at 1 m3\/hr.  The \nparticulate matter is collected on an internal impactor with a 50% cut off point around \n100nm, so that, unlike simple filter samples, only particles larger than around 100nm \nin aerodynamic diameter are collected and measured. After sampling, the impactor is \nheated to two temperatures (~350oC and ~750oC) in ambient air to obtain measures of \norganic and total carbon content through the amount of carbon dioxide generated. The \nanalysis is performed using an infrared LiCor detection system to measure the amount \nof CO2. Elemental carbon is calculated by subtraction of the organic carbon content \nfrom the total carbon content. There is no optical correction for the pyrolysis of \norganics during the first heating phase. For this comparison, daily mean \nconcentrations were calculated from the hourly measured values. \nSeveral differences are to be expected between data obtained by this automatic \nmethod compared to those from the manual method described in the previous section. \nThe impactor collection means that the many particles smaller than 100 nm in size \nwill not contribute to the result. As fresh diesel particles are typically 30 nm in size \nthis is likely to be very significant at kerbside locations. The less sophisticated split \nbetween OC and EC will inevitably lead to different results from the thermo-optical \nmethod. More fundamentally, although the LiCor sensor can be calibrated with a \nknown CO2 mixture, the whole system (including the impaction and heating stages) is \n7 \n \nnot amenable to direct calibration with a known amount of carbon material. \nTherefore, unlike the manual method, even the accuracy of the TC measurements is \ndifficult to assess. (The manual method TC calibration does not include sampling \nlosses through the inlet, filter collection efficiency or sampling artefacts such as losses \nof semivolatile organic compounds or collection of volatile organic compounds. Filter \ncollection efficiencies are high for all particle sizes, so that collection is much less of \na problem for the manual method than for the impactor. Losses in pipework are a \nseparable issue affecting both methods. Sampling artefacts are largely a matter of \nconvention until a reference method is defined.)  \nStudies performed by the US-EPA have shown that results from the 5400 instrument \ndid not agree well with results obtained using the NIOSH 5040 protocol (US-EPA, \n2005). They found significant negative bias in the R&P 5400 TC, OC, and EC data at \nall of their five sites, with regression slopes typically 0.4 to 0.6, combined with poor \nreproducibility (termed predictability in the document). Results from this instrument \nshould therefore be treated a priori with more caution than those from the other \nmethods. \n \n \n2.3 Black Smoke \n \nThe Black Smoke method involved pumping air at a rate of 0.084 m3\/hr through a \nknown area of Whatman Number 1 cellulose filter paper, and measuring the darkness \nof the stain by a measurement at the National Physical Laboratory of its reflectance of \nwhite light - the reflectance being relative to the light reflected by a clean filter of the \nsame material. The inlet, essentially an upturned funnel, provides crude size selection, \nremoving particles above around 4.5 \u03bcm (McFarland et al, 1982). The reflectance \nmeasurements were made using an EEL M43D Smokestain Reflectometer. The \n8 \n \nreflectance, volume and area are converted to a Black Smoke Index using a standard \ntable based on ISO 9835 (1993). There are clear theoretical grounds (Quincey, 2007), \nfor considering that the Black Smoke Index IBS is related to estimates of black carbon \nCBC, as measured by an aethalometer (below), following the relation: \n72.76.5918.4].[ 3 \u2212+=\u2212 BSBC ImgC \u03bc  \nIn the presentations of data below, Black Smoke results, which would otherwise \nappear anomalously high compared with other measures of elemental or black carbon, \nhave been converted to \u201cblack carbon\u201d results using this equation. \nThe sampler flow was calibrated annually using a traceable flowmeter. The \nreflectometer protocol involves zeroing the instrument for each measurement, while \nthe reflectance scale was checked against tiles certified at NPL. \n \n2.4 Aethalometer \n \nAethalometers quantify \u201cblack carbon\u201d on filter samples based on the transmission of \nlight through a sample. The sample is collected onto a quartz tape, and the absorption \ncoefficient of the sample is measured by a single pass transmission of light through \nthe sample, measured relative to a clean piece of filter. 880 nm wavelength light was \nused. The absorption coefficient \u03b1 [m-1] is calculated from the transmission, area and \nvolume of the sample, and converted to a black carbon concentration CBC, as a first \napproximation, using the mass extinction coefficient \u03b1atn. \n  \nWith the Magee AE22 Aethalometer instrument used for the data below, the value \nused is \u03b1atn =16.6 m2\/g (taken from Magee literature). Instrument flow was calibrated \nwith traceable flowmeters. The aethalometer operated at Marylebone Road  had a \n9 \n \nPM2.5 inlet, while the one at Auchencorth Moss has an aerodynamic size cutoff at the \ninlet of 3.3 \u03bcm. \n \n3 Parallel measurements of Black Smoke, aethalometer black carbon, \nautomatic EC\/OC and manual EC\/OC at a London kerbside site, September to \nDecember 2006 \n \nThe results presented here are selected from a larger study reported as the Marylebone \nRoad Aethalometer Trial Report (Green et al, 2007). The aim of the larger study was \nprimarily to evaluate aethalometer instruments for measurements of Black Smoke. \nSome results comparing an aethalometer with an automated Black Smoke instrument \n(ETL SX200) were published within the paper by Quincey (2007). In this paper the \naethalometer results are compared with those from the other instruments used within \nmeasurement networks. \nMarylebone Road is a kerbside monitoring site in central London (UK ordnance \nsurvey grid reference 528120, 182000). Marylebone Road is a major route in and out \nof Central London, running north-east to south-west and carrying approximately \n90,000 vehicles per day. The tall buildings on either side form a broad street canyon \nabout 40m across. The monitoring cabin is located 1m from the kerb on the southern \nside of the road. \nDue to space limitations it was not possible to site all the equipment exactly \nequidistant from the kerb. Although disparities were kept to a minimum, the fact that \ntraffic emissions dominate measurements at this site means that small differences in \ndistance from the road need to be considered. The exact distances from the kerb were:  \n8-port sampler (Black Smoke), 1.50m; R&P Automatic Carbon Monitor 5400, 2.23m; \n10 \n \nMagee Aethalometer AE-21, 2.97m; Partisol 2025 (used to collect samples for \nanalysis by Sunset) 2.97m.  \nParallel results are available for a period of about three months between September \nand December 2006. They are presented here separately as \u201celemental\u201d carbon \nresults, and \u201corganic\u201d carbon results. The \u201celemental\u201d results contain the automatic \nand manual EC, the aethalometer black carbon, and the Black Smoke, and these are \nshown in Figure 1. The Black Smoke results have been converted from Black Smoke \nIndex to black carbon (\u03bcg\/m3) as described above. The pyrolysis corrections on the \nmanual OC\/EC results were calculated using the transmittance data. \n \n \n \n \n \n[Insert Figure 1] \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMarylebone Road 2006\n0.00\n5.00\n10.00\n15.00\n20.00\n25.00\nThu 28 Sep Thu 12 Oct Thu 26 Oct Thu 09 Nov Thu 23 Nov Thu 07 Dec Thu 21 Dec\nDate\nug\n.m\n-3\nEC - Manual EC - Auto\nFigure 1: Daily mean \u201celemental\u201d carbon concentrations from a London kerbside site. \n \naethalometer Black Smoke converted to Black Carbon\n11 \n \nThere is reasonable quantitative agreement between the manual EC, the aethalometer, \nand the converted Black Smoke, especially in view of the fact that one instrument is \nbased on chemical analysis and the other two are based on optical properties, and the \ninhomogeneities associated with a kerbside site. The major discrepancy is between \nthese instruments and the automatic EC, which typically underreads by approximately \na factor 3. The likely explanation for this is that at the kerbside, a large proportion of \nthe elemental carbon is in the form of particulates with an aerodynamic diameter less \nthan 100nm, which would not be collected by the sampling impactor of the R & P \nautomatic instrument, whereas the three other methods collect smaller particles \nefficiently on fibrous filters. \nFigure 2 shows the \u201corganic\u201d carbon results. In contrast to the elemental results, there \nis much better agreement between the manual and automatic methods. However, a \nstep change can be observed in the relationship between the two sets of results, \napparently coinciding with a six-monthly service visit on 2nd November. The results \neither side of the service have been scaled using the routine calibrations for CO2 at the \nsite, but this has not removed the effect. We interpret this as an indication that the lack \nof direct full-instrument calibration in the automatic instrument makes reliable \nQA\/QC difficult. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n12 \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n[Insert Figure 2] \n \n \n \nMarylebone Road 2006\n0.00\n5.00\n10.00\n15.00\n20.00\n25.00\n30.00\nMon 04\nSep\nMon 18\nSep\nMon 02 Oct Mon 16 Oct Mon 30 Oct Mon 13\nNov\nMon 27\nNov\nMon 11\nDec\nMon 25\nDec\nMon 08 Jan\nDate\nC\nar\nbo\nn,\n \u03bc\ng.\nm\n-3\nManual OC Auto OC\nFigure 2: Daily mean organic carbon concentrations from a London kerbside site. \nThe imperfect methods for distinguishing between \u201corganic\u201d and \u201celemental\u201d carbon \nin these instruments means that one would expect the total carbon (TC) to agree more \nclosely than the separate fractions. In this case, the large difference in the EC results, \nof around 10 \u03bcg\/m3, means that the total carbon results from the two instruments \ndiffer by about a factor of 2, with around 20 \u03bcg\/m3 TC from the manual method and \n10 \u03bcg\/m3 from the automatic. \n4 Parallel measurements of automatic EC\/OC and manual EC\/OC (August \nto October 2006), and Black Smoke and automatic EC (March to April 2007) at \na London background site.  \n \nThe North Kensington site is classified as an urban background site, in the grounds of \na school in a residential area 7 km to the west of central London. Further details about \nthe monitoring site can be found through the website www.bv-aurnsiteinfo.co.uk. \n13 \n \nThe site is expected to be much less dominated by traffic emissions than Marylebone \nRoad, with lower particulate concentrations and with larger elemental carbon particles \ndue to agglomeration. \nThe parallel data is in two parts: firstly, measurements from manual and automatic \nOC\/EC instruments over the period August to October 2006, and secondly from \nautomatic OC\/EC and Black Smoke in March and April 2007. Only the EC results \nfrom this latter period are presented. \nResults from the manual and automatic EC and OC are shown in Figures 3 and 4.

The automatic EC results do not under-read the manual \nones by a factor of 3, but rather tend to over-read by an average of around 40%, \nalthough the difference is quite variable, and the period 12th to 20th September shows \nreasonable agreement. Automatic OC is about a factor of 2 larger than the manual \nOC, unlike the near parity at Marylebone Road. Total carbon with the automatic \nmethod at around 10 \u03bcg\/m3 is typically a factor of 2 larger than the manual one (5 \n\u03bcg\/m3), in direct contrast to the results from Marylebone Road. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 4: Daily mean organic carbon concentrations at a London background site. \nNorth Kensington\n0.00\n5.00\n10.00\n15.00\n20.00\n25.00\n01\n\/08\n\/20\n06\n08\n\/08\n\/20\n06\n15\n\/08\n\/20\n06\n22\n\/08\n\/20\n06\n29\n\/08\n\/20\n06\n05\n\/09\n\/20\n06\n12\n\/09\n\/20\n06\n19\n\/09\n\/20\n06\n26\n\/09\n\/20\n06\n03\n\/10\n\/20\n06\n10\n\/10\n\/20\n06\n17\n\/10\n\/20\n06\n24\n\/10\n\/20\n06\nug\n\/m\n3 Manual OC\nAuto OC\n \n \n15 \n \nThese differences have no obvious explanation. Selected repeat measurements made \non the manual OC\/EC instrument using second samples cut from the same filters \nshowed good agreement, and the more direct QA\/QC for the manual method means \nthat there is little reason to doubt their basic accuracy, especially for TC. The much \nhigher TC results from the automatic method are therefore hard to account for, \nespecially as the automatic instrument will be sampling a narrower particle size range. \nWe interpret this as an example of the generic inability to characterise the \nperformance of the automatic instrument in a satisfactory way. Other anomalous \nresults from these instruments have been noted (eg Hayman et al, 2008 and US-EPA, \n2005). It is clear that while these instruments can produce useful data within their \ninherent limitations, the inability to check whether the instrument is functioning \nnormally is a major barrier to confident application of their data. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNorth Kensington\n0.00\n1.00\n2.00\n3.00\n4.00\n5.00\n6.00\n7.00\n01\n\/03\n\/2\n7\n\/03\n\/20\n07\n05\n\/03\n\/20\n07\n07\n\/03\n\/20\n07\n09\n\/03\n\/20\n07\n11\n\/03\n\/20\n07\n13\n\/03\n\/20\n07\n15\n\/03\n\/20\n07\n17\n\/03\n\/20\n07\n19\n\/03\n\/20\n07\n21\n\/03\n\/20\n07\n23\n\/03\n\/20\n07\n25\n\/03\n\/20\n07\n27\n\/03\n\/20\n07\n29\n\/03\n\/20\n07\n31\n\/03\n\/20\n07\n02\n\/04\n\/20\n07\n04\n\/04\n\/20\n07\nug\n\/m\n3\n00\n03\nAuto EC Black Smoke converted to black carbon\nFigure 5: Daily mean elemental carbon concentrations and converted Black Smoke measurements at a \nLondon background site. \n16 \n \n \nFigure 5 shows the second set of data from the North Kensington site, a period of \nseveral weeks soon after the start of Black Smoke measurements at the site and \nshortly before the end of automatic OC\/EC measurements, starting about six months \nafter the previous data set.  \nThe agreement is remarkably close. One can speculate that the automatic OC\/EC was \noperating, like the period from 12th to 20th September, to give results close to parity \nwith manual EC results, and hence close to the black carbon results. However, in view \nof the variability of performance of the automatic instrument noted previously, there \nis likely to be an element of luck in the agreement, and it would be difficult to \nextrapolate from this observation to other sets of results.  \n \n5 Parallel measurements of aethalometer black carbon and manual EC at a \nrural Scottish site, June to December 2006. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n[Insert Figure 6] \n \nFigure 6: Daily mean aethalometer and elemental carbon concentration measurements \nat a rural Scottish site. \n \nAuchencorth Moss\n0.00\n0.10\n0.20\n0.30\n0.40\n0.50\n0.60\n0.70\n0.80\n0.90\n1.00\n16\n\/06\n\/20\n06\n30\n\/06\n\/20\n06\n14\n\/07\n\/20\n06\n28\n\/07\n\/20\n06\n11\n\/08\n\/20\n06\n25\n\/08\n\/20\n06\n08\n\/09\n\/20\n06\n22\n\/09\n\/20\n06\n06\n\/10\n\/20\n0\n20\n\/10\n\/20\n0\n03\n\/11\n\/20\n0\n17\n\/11\n\/20\n01\n\/12\n\/20\n15\n\/12\n\/20\n29\n\/12\n\/2\nug\n\/m\n3 Aethalometer\nManual EC\n6 6 6 06 06 06 00\n6\n17 \n \nFigure 6: Daily mean aethalometer and elemental carbon concentration measurements at a rural \nScottish site. \n \nThe final data set is from the EMEP rural background site at Auchencorth Moss in \nScotland. The site is situated 3 km from the nearest road in the middle of a peat bog, 8 \nkm south-west of the town of Penicuik, SE Scotland (lat 55:44:49N, long 3:39:22W). \nMore details can be found at http:\/\/www.heavymetals.ceh.ac.uk\/sites\/site_auc.htm. \n \nThere are two significant differences in the measurement method for manual EC\/OC \nfrom the previous data. Firstly, the quartz filters were not pre-baked. Blank \nmeasurements showed negligible amounts of EC on the filters but variable amounts of \nOC comparable in quantity with the sampled OC. Secondly, for these measurements \nthe pyrolysis correction was made with the reflectance data, as the transmittance data \nwas not available. It is widely found that EC data using a reflectance correction will \nbe higher than those found using a transmittance correction (eg Chow et al, 2001), as \nthe correction for pyrolysed material tends to be smaller. \nThe concentrations are very low, less than 1 \u03bcg\/m3, and it is notable that in this case \nthe manual method significantly underreads the aethalometer data, to the extent that \nmany of the manual EC data are zero. Simple regression analysis gives a relationship \nbetween the two data sets of EC(aeth) = 1.33 EC(manual) + 0.2  \u03bcg\/m3, with R2 = \n0.79. \nAs the darkening of the filter registered by the aethalometer is likely to be real, this \nsuggests that the manual EC method is overcorrecting for pyrolysis, even when using \nthe reflectance data. While the TC measurement from the manual method should be \ncorrect, this would imply that the conventional split between EC and OC using \ncommon thermo-optical methods under-reads the \u201ctrue\u201d elemental carbon (as \nindicated by the presence of soot), whether a transmittance or a reflectance charring \n18 \n \ncorrection is used. These effects would probably have little consequence for roadside \nmeasurements, but could be very significant for rural sites.  \n 6 Conclusions  \nThe purpose of this paper is to highlight some measurement issues associated with \nambient particulate organic, elemental and black carbon, as monitored at UK network \nsites, to provide background information to aid interpretation of the data. The \nexamples presented are not comprehensive, but are relevant to this active field of \nstudy both in the UK and more widely. \nThe main conclusions are that, from the results available, the R & P 5400 instruments \ngreatly under-read EC and TC at kerbside sites, probably due to the fact that the \nsmaller particles are not sampled by the instrument; the R & P 5400 instrument is \ninherently difficult to characterise, so that all quantitative results need to be treated \nwith caution; both aethalometer and Black Smoke (converted to black carbon) \nmeasurements can show reasonable agreement with elemental carbon results; and \nmanual thermo-optical OC\/EC results using the \u201cQuartz\u201d protocol may under-read EC \n(and hence overread OC), whether either transmittance or reflectance is used for the \npyrolysis correction, and this effect is significant at rural sites. \n \n  \nAcknowledgements \nThe authors would like to thank the UK\u2019s Department for Environment, Food and \nRural Affairs (Defra) for funding the Marylebone Road trial and the EMEP \nmonitoring site at Auchencorth Moss; and the UK\u2019s Department for Innovation, \nUniversities and Skills (DIUS) for support through its Chemical and Biological \nMetrology Programme.  \n19 \n \n References \n \nAQEG, 2005.
