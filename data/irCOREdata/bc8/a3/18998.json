For the first time, \nPublic Law 107-110 links high stakes testing with strict accountability measures designed \nto ensure that, at least in schools that receive government funding, no child is left behind. \nThe appropriately named No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) links government funding to \nstrict improvement policies for America\u2019s public schools. Much of what is undertaken in \nNCLB is praiseworthy, the Act is essentially equitable for it ensures that schools pay due \nregard to the progress of those sections of the school population who have traditionally \ndone less well in school, in particular, students from economically disadvantaged homes, \nas well as those from ethnic minority backgrounds and those who have limited \nproficiency to speak English.

Through an exploration of \nschool level data for the state of New Jersey, the paper considers the extent to which \nthese concerns have been justified during the early days of No Child Left Behind. \n \nWhat is No Child Left Behind? \n \n\u2018There have been two basic policy eras in US education policy since mid-century: a \nstruggle for access and equity that dominated the period from 1960 to 1980 and a \n'This is an electronic version of an article published in The Journal of Education Policy \nVol. 20, No. 4 (July 2005): 507-524.

For a seemingly equitable Act, which endeavours to ensure the academic \nprogress of all students, the levels of criticism that have met its inception have been \nsurprising. Despite this apparently equitable intent, some commentators fear that the high \nstakes testing and accountability-linked sanctions that underpin the Act could result in \nmany otherwise successful schools being labelled as failing. Through an examination of \nhow strict accountability measures became so entwined with government policy to raise \nstandards in American public schools and an exploration of school level data for the state \nof New Jersey, this paper considers the extent to which these concerns have been justified \nduring the early days of No Child Left Behind. \n \nNo Child Left Behind requires that all schools and school districts which receive Title-1 \nfederal funding put into place a set of standards for improving student achievement, \ntogether with detailed plans charting how these standards with be monitored and met. \nTitle-1 is a part of the Elementary and Secondary Schools Act which distributes federal \nfunds to disadvantaged areas, about 90% of America\u2019s 15,000 school districts receive \nTitle-1 funding (Ravitch 1995). A major consequence of these standards is that schools \nwill be required to set targets and monitor the progress of students, and subgroups of \nstudents, in order to ensure that 100% of all students reach certain minimum proficiency \nlevels by 2014. Failure to achieve proficiency would lead to \u2018corrective action\u2019, which, in \nits most extreme manifestation would result in school closure (Department of Education \n2002). Unlike the UK, the US has a very de-centralised system of education, with much \nof the control over schools devolved to school districts which act on behalf of the state. \nThere is no national assessment system nor a national curriculum, the responsibility for \nascertaining standards, assessment tools and curriculum coverage lies with the individual \n'This is an electronic version of an article published in The Journal of Education Policy \nVol. 20, No. 4 (July 2005): 507-524.

However, just like in the UK, a \u2018crisis account\u2019 exists over the apparent \nunderachievement of American schools, particularly with regard to their relative \nperformance in international comparative tests (Schmidt et al 1999). Legislation like No \nChild Left Behind is designed, through complex systems of school accountability and \nsanctions, to remedy this. \n \nThe concept of accountability coupled with high stakes testing is not new in US \neducational policy; indeed NCLB is a composite of earlier legislation, including state-\nwide accountability protocols and testing regimes. During the 1990s, the majority of \nstates introduced an element of state-wide testing and, to a lesser extent, accountability \nmeasures, and by 2002 most had some form of testing procedure in place (Rudalevige \n2003). However, what is new, is the scope and potential impact of the NCLB sanctions, \nand many commentators fear that the undertaking to ensure that every child reaches full \nproficiency may result in large numbers of otherwise successful schools being labelled as \nfailing (Kane and Staiger 2003, Popham 2004). \n \nBy January 2003, each state was required to submit to the US Department of Education a \ndetailed workbook outlining the steps they would undertake to ensure compliance with \nthe statutes set out under NCLB. The Act itself requires that by 2005, states assess \nperformance annually in grades 3 to 81 in Language Arts Literacy and Mathematics, and \nin Science by 2007. Additional tests must also be administered to students during grades \n10 to 122\n                                                 \n1 National Curriculum years 4 to 9 \n. States must also indicate how both schools and school districts will \ndemonstrate Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) towards full proficiency by 2014 and make \npublic their test results. This performance data will also be disaggregated according to \ndifferent student sub-groups, characterised by students\u2019 sex, minority group, Special \nEducational Need, level of economic disadvantage and English language proficiency. \nTypically, a subgroup would comprise 25 students, although states do vary in their \n2 National Curriculum years 11 to 13 \n \n'This is an electronic version of an article published in The Journal of Education Policy \nVol. 20, No. 4 (July 2005): 507-524.

In addition to annual testing, schools must also ensure that at least 95% of all \nstudents are assessed. If this target is not met, then schools will not make AYP, regardless \nof the proficiency scores of the remainder of the cohort (Popham 2004). If a school fails \nto make AYP, a series of sanctions can be administered by the school district. The form \nof these sanctions ranges from district level monitoring through to giving parents the \noption to transfer their children out of 'failing\u2019 schools and providing students who \nremain in the school with additional tutoring. In more extreme cases, where a school fails \nto make AYP for four or more consecutive years, that school can be faced with having to \nreplace staff, aspects of the curriculum or, at the extreme, be re-structured as a Charter \nschool or one run by a private company. \n \n\u2018Compassionate conservatism\u2019 and the \u2018failure\u2019 of public schools: The origins of NCLB \n \nThe NCLB Act has risen from a \u2018primeval soup\u2019 (Kingdon J., in Rudalevige 2003, p27) \nof education policy to raise standards in America\u2019s public schools that has spanned \nseveral decades. Although many of the components of the Act contain little that is \ncompletely new, what is unusual is how the Act managed to achieve widespread \nbipartisan support from Congress. Traditionally the federal government, and Republican \nadministrations, in particular, has avoided much direct influence in educational \ninitiatives, particularly as federal funds only contribute about 7% of a state\u2019s total \neducational revenue (Hochschild 2003).    In order to appreciate this unprecedented level \nof federal interest in educational achievement in the context of the No Child Left Behind \nAct, it is important to recognise that standards in America\u2019s public schools have long \nbeen under scrutiny. The launch of Sputnik in 1957 by the USSR had far reaching \nrepercussions and created pressure on schools to raise academic standards, as well as \nenrolment on mathematics, science and foreign language courses (Ravitch 1995).  \n \n'This is an electronic version of an article published in The Journal of Education Policy \nVol. 20, No. 4 (July 2005): 507-524.

The \ninvective used in this document is strong and condemns the \u2018rising tide of mediocrity\u2019 \n(NCEE 1983) which was eroding the American public school system: \n \n\u2018If an unfriendly foreign power had attempted to impose on America   \nthe mediocre educational performance that exists today, we might well have \nviewed it as an act of war\u2019 (NCEE 1983, p3) \n \nWhile the emphasis on raising standards can be traced back to at least the 1980s, federal \ninterest in public school accountability, coupled with high stakes testing and elements of \nschool choice has been evident in education policy reforms ever since. Consequently, the \nNo Child Left Behind Act \u2018collected and encompassed proposals advanced in theory and \nsubstance for years, accrediting Ronald Regan-, George H W Bush- and Bill Clinton-era \ninitiatives into a single bill\u2019 (Rudalevige 2003, p24).  \n \nHaving established the key developments surrounding the inception and content of this \nnew piece of legislation, the following section will consider how some of the \naccountability measures demanded under No Child Left Behind are working in practice \nduring the early days of the Act.  \n \nMaking Adequate Yearly Progress: concerns over rules for student subgroups \n \nOn the one hand raising the achievement of students in all America\u2019s public schools \nwould appear to be both equitable and praiseworthy. However, some of the implications \n'This is an electronic version of an article published in The Journal of Education Policy \nVol. 20, No. 4 (July 2005): 507-524. The Journal of Education Policy is available online \nat: http:\/\/www.tandf.co.uk\/journals\/titles\/02680939.asp.  \n \n6\nof NCLB\u2019s strict accountability rules and sanctions, in particular those that apply to \nstudent subgroups, could result in great numbers of schools and their students being \nlabelled as failing. One of the strengths of the Act is that, as its very title suggests, it \ndemands that the academic progress of every child, regardless how able, be open to \nscrutiny. However, the reason that many commentators and practitioners take issue with \nthis, is that the Act also states very clearly that not only is every child expected to make \nprogress, they must make sufficient progress to achieve minimum competency levels \nwithin 12 years of the Act\u2019s inception. According to Linn, one of the flaws with the 100% \nproficiency target is in its expectation that all schools must achieve the 100% levels, even \nthough the number of schools who are actually at those levels today is very small. In \nother words, he argues that \u2018we should not set a goal for all schools that is so high that no \nschool has yet achieved it\u2019 (2003, p4). \n \nAs NCLB does not mandate specific annual progress targets towards full proficiency, \nevery state is required to chart their own timeline for making Adequate Yearly Progress, \nso that by 2014 each student, and student subgroup, achieves at or above the state\u2019s \nproficiency levels. The Act, however, does specify that students must make annual \nincremental progress towards full proficiency. The temptation, of course, is that states \nwill set their AYP targets very low, focusing for example on basic skills tests (Hess 2003, \nMcNeill 2000, Haney 2000). According to Popham (2004), such incremental progress \nwould mean that many schools would have to raise the number of \u2018at proficiency\u2019 \nstudents by 5 or 6 percentage points annually. For these schools, sustaining such year on \nyear increases could result in many of them failing to meet AYP targets within a few \nyears. Indeed, according to Lee, the progress rates of many schools would have to \nincrease by 6 or 7 times if proficiency targets are to be reached by the 2014 deadline (Lee \n2004). In their efforts to minimize the chances of costly \u2018AYP-induced failure\u2019, some \nstates have crafted what Popham calls \u2018inventive\u2019 timelines. Figure 1 below shows the \ntimeline for achieving full proficiency in state tests in Grade 8 mathematics in New \nJersey. \n'This is an electronic version of an article published in The Journal of Education Policy \nVol. 20, No. 4 (July 2005): 507-524.

For example, in New Jersey in 2005, 49% \nof students are expected to meet proficiency levels in Grade 8 mathematics. Schools, in \norder to make AYP, would first have to achieve and then maintain these levels for the \nnext two years before making a relatively large 13 percentage point jump in 2008, when \n62% of students would have to be proficient. This means that between 2003 and 2007, \nschool proficiency levels, on this scale will only have to increase by 10 percentage points, \nrather than the 20 percentage points required on a linear scale.  \n \nIt also means that only about half of the school\u2019s students have to be proficient by the end \nof 2007, leaving the remaining 50%, presumably students of lower ability, or those with \nLimited English Proficiency, to achieve these levels in the remaining 7 years of the Act. \nAdditionally, in 7 of the timeline\u2019s 12 years, no annual progress at all is required. The \njustification for leaving larger jumps in the numbers of students achieving proficiency \nlevels until later on in the Act\u2019s lifetime would seem sensible. It is a new and untried \n'This is an electronic version of an article published in The Journal of Education Policy \nVol. 20, No. 4 (July 2005): 507-524.

One need only read an edition of \nEducation Week (the US equivalent of the Times Education Supplement) to see that \namendments to NCLB legislation are likely. It should also be noted that New Jersey is by \nno means alone in setting timelines like this; Ohio, for example, has a similar system \n(Linn 2003). \n \nHowever, even at the start of the 12-year timeline towards full proficiency, the numbers \nof schools failing to make AYP are large. In Washington State, in 2003, 436 out of 2000 \nschools failed to make AYP (Bylsma 2004), predictions for California for the 2004-05 \nschool year indicate that almost two-thirds of the state\u2019s schools will not make AYP \n(Perry 2004), and in Missouri half of the state\u2019s 2000 public schools failed to make AYP \nin 2003 (Education Week 2004b).  \n \nAnother important feature of these AYP timelines is how they compare with the states\u2019 \nown accountability measures. Several states already have their own accountability \ntargets, many of which have been in place for some time. In fact 21 states are maintaining \ntheir own accountability systems in parallel to NCLB (Education Week 2004a). However, \nthe two systems do not necessarily concur, in fact, in just about every state a higher \nproportion of schools met state AYP targets but not targets for NCLB. For example, in \nCalifornia, 78% of schools met the state accountability requirements, compared to only \n55% for NCLB, and in North Carolina, 90% of schools met the state requirements and \nonly 47% made AYP under No Child Left Behind (Education Week 2004a). This presents \na dilemma, not only for parents whose children\u2019s schools, on one accountability measure \nare successful and on the other, are labelled as \u2018failing\u2019 and subject to corrective \nsanctions. It certainly begs the question of whose accountability system most accurately \nreflects progress and achievement in schools. It would seen bizarre, but certainly not \nunlikely to foresee a scenario where a school that has failed to make AYP under No Child \n'This is an electronic version of an article published in The Journal of Education Policy \nVol. 20, No. 4 (July 2005): 507-524.

While few would disagree that challenging the progress \nof groups of students who have traditionally done less well in school is praiseworthy; the \nissue lies with the expectation that these students must also meet the demanding AYP \nproficiency targets otherwise their schools will receive stiff penalties. According to Kane \nand Staiger, the use of subgroup rules is \u2018counter productive in test-based accountability \nsystems\u2019 (2003, p152), while Linn argues that \u2018the goals that NCLB sets for student \nachievement would be wonderful if they could be reached, but, unfortunately, they are \nquite unrealistic, so much so, that they are apt to do more to demoralise educators than to \ninspire them\u2019 (Linn 2003, p10).  \n \nThat 100% of students are required to reach full proficiency levels, when relatively few \ndo at present, is to some commentators unworkable, not least because of the way that \ndisadvantaged groups of students are unevenly distributed in America\u2019s schools. These \nare concerns that focus mainly, although not exclusively, on the educational experiences \nof children who live in America\u2019s large cities. Although the United States is a wealthy \ncountry, there exist within it large pockets of poor and isolated groups. With one of the \nmost unequal distributions of wealth of any industrialised country, the US has large \nsections of its population living in poverty, mainly in the urban areas of large cities \n(Orfield 2000). The fact that students from different economic and cultural backgrounds \nare not distributed evenly throughout the USA, and indeed are clustered in certain \nlocalities, has important implications for the NCLB subgroup rules. With many \ncommentators suggesting that the sanctions linked to the subgroup proficiency measures \nwill result in diverse schools and schools with large numbers of students being unfairly \n'This is an electronic version of an article published in The Journal of Education Policy \nVol. 20, No. 4 (July 2005): 507-524.

In the USA, \nthese schools are likely to be those with large proportions of students with Limited \nEnglish Proficiency (LEP), as well as children from certain ethnic minority backgrounds \nand those from poorer homes. \n \nAt present in the United States, over 7 million children are enrolled in elementary and \nsecondary schools in the nation\u2019s central cities, and almost a third of all children of \nschool age (over 15 million children) live in the suburban fringes of these cities \n(Department of Education 2002a, NCES 2002). However, the distribution of children \nwithin both these communities is uneven.  Only 6% of white children attend schools in \nurban areas, compared with 31% of children from ethnic minority backgrounds (in \nparticular African-American and Hispanic children) (Department of Education 2002a). \nNationally, 16% of children, between the ages of 5 and 17, are identified as living in \npoverty, 24% of these children live in the central cities, while 10% live in their suburbs \n(Department of Education 2002a). In some states like New Mexico and California, over \n80% of schools contain a Hispanic or African-American subgroup, compared to only 5% \nof schools in Virginia. Additionally, 92% of African-American students and 91% of \nHispanics attend schools with Black or Hispanic subgroups, compared with only 33% of \nwhite students (Kane and Staiger 2003).  \n \nThat African-American students perform less well on standardised tests than European \nAmericans is well documented in US educational research. Longitudinal assessments \nsince the 1960s have shown white students to be ahead in every measure and at every \ngrade (Jencks and Phillips 1998). More recently, data from the National Assessment of \nEducational Performance (NAEP) revealed wide disparities between the attainment of \nAfrican-American and white students. Similar trends were also reported between the \nperformance of students from white and Hispanic backgrounds. According to the authors \nof the study, \u2018the single most important determinant of the difference in failure rates \nbetween states is likely to be the racial composition of their schools\u2019 (Kane and Staiger \n'This is an electronic version of an article published in The Journal of Education Policy \nVol. 20, No. 4 (July 2005): 507-524.

In addition, the reason why almost 57% of Ohio\u2019s school districts failed to \nmake AYP in 2003 was either partly or fully because of the progress of students with \nSEN (Chester 2004). In Washington state, it was larger schools with more diverse \npopulations who were also less likely to achieve yearly accountability targets (Bylsma \n2004). Texas, one state held up as a model of school accountability reforms, has for some \ntime monitored proficiency targets for subgroups of students. However, the expected \ntargets were different for students at aggregate and disaggregate level: 90% proficiency \ntargets overall and 55% proficiency targets for subgroups of students (Kane and Staiger \n2003).  \n \nSo on the one hand, we have a seemingly equitable piece of legislation, designed to give \nall students equal chances of success in school. However, schooling in America's public \nschools appears to be anything but equitable. The concern is that, in its present form, the \nNo Child Left Behind legislation could further enhance these inequities and unfairly label \nchildren and schools as underachieving. In the final section of this paper, we consider the \nextent to which some of the fears of the opponents of No Child Left Behind have been \nrealised during the early days of the legislation. Using the state of New Jersey as a case \nstudy, we consider how accurately we are able to label schools that do not make AYP as \nunderachieving or failing. \n \nNo Child Left Behind - New Jersey style \nNew Jersey is the most densely populated state in the USA. It has a population of around \n8 million people, only 10% of whom live in the New Jersey\u2019s six largest cities. In 1999-\n2001, the median household income in New Jersey was above that for the rest of the \nnation ($52,137, compared with $42,873 nationally), and fewer children and adults were \nidentified as living in poverty (NCES 2002). New Jersey has 626 school districts, 120 of \nwhich are classed as wealthy and 30 districts that are designated as the poorest or \u2018special \nneeds\u2019 districts. These poorest districts are also known as the \u2018Abbott\u2019 districts, so named \nafter the plaintiffs who brought about the legal challenges to the distribution of school \n'This is an electronic version of an article published in The Journal of Education Policy \nVol. 20, No. 4 (July 2005): 507-524.

The New Jersey Department of Education \ncategorises school districts in the range A-I based on their relative wealth and \nsocioeconomic status. Schools in the A category are overwhelmingly, although not \nexclusively, located in the poorer Abbott districts, while schools in categories I and J are \nlocated in the wealthiest school districts (New Jersey Department of Education 2004b). \nThis categorization of New Jersey\u2019s school districts is important, educational policy in \nNew Jersey has been shaped by over 25 years of school finance litigation and by 20 years \nof state efforts to hold school districts financially accountable for the quality of the \neducation they provide. In June 1990, the state supreme court declared that New Jersey\u2019s \nschool finance law was unconstitutional, that urban schools were not providing their \nstudents with the \u2018through and efficient\u2019 education demanded in New Jersey\u2019s \nconstitution and that funding inequities should be eliminated (Firestone et al 1997). In its \nruling, the New Jersey state supreme court required that more financial resources go to \npoorer urban districts than to wealthier ones. The premise for this was that because of \ntheir additional social and community responsibilities, schools in the urban districts \nneeded more money than those in wealthier areas. Schools in urban New Jersey had \nsuffered many decades of under-funding and decline, not just because of changing \ndemographics in the central cities, but also because of the way in which education is \nfinanced in the USA (Anyon 1997). In America, public school funding is available from \nthree main sources, the federal government, who typically contribute about 7-8%; the \nstate (contributing around 48%) and local taxes (around 45%), although the exact \nproportions do vary by state (Adams and Adams 2003, Flanagan and Gissmer 2004, The \nEducation Trust 2002 and table 1 below). States tend to delegate their proportion of the \nfunds based on student numbers and student characteristics and under this mechanism \nurban areas do tend to get more funding. However, local financing tends to be closely \nlinked to property taxes. Therefore higher property values will raise more money for local \nschools. In urban areas, where property prices tend to be lower than in the suburbs, the \nfunds raised for schools by property taxes are proportionally lower than those raised in \nsuburban districts. These different funding mechanisms result in many of America\u2019s \n'This is an electronic version of an article published in The Journal of Education Policy \nVol. 20, No. 4 (July 2005): 507-524.

For example, in New York state, where the \nfunding gaps are among the largest, pupils who attend school in districts in the upper \nquartile for poverty can be allocated $2,152 per student less than if they had attended a \nschool in a district in the lower quartile for poverty. These $2,152 equate to a difference \nof $53,800 for a class of 25 students, or $860,800 for a school of 400 students. Similar \ngaps in state and local funding appear between districts with the highest and lowest \nproportions of students from ethnic minority backgrounds; a gap which nationally \ncorresponds to $902 per pupil, or $22,550 for a class of 25 students and $360,800 for a \nschool of 400 (The Education Trust 2002). \n \nIn New Jersey, where school funding is among the most equitable in the whole of the \nUnited States, mainly as a result of judicial intervention over the last two decades, \nstudents in the poorest school districts do receive a greater proportion of state funding \nand per pupil expenditure than those in the wealthiest districts (table 1). Notice also the \nrelatively low proportion of funding that is provided by the federal government, typically \naround 3%. It is this funding stream that is directly linked to the NCLB sanctions. \n \nTable 1: Distribution of school funding according to the relative wealth of school districts \nin New Jersey. \n \nDistrict Number of \nschools \nMean revenue \nfrom local \nsources (%) \nMean revenue \nfrom state \nsources (%) \nMean revenue \nfrom federal \nsources (%) \nPer pupil \nexpenditure ($) \nA 398 13 75 5 13227 \nB 263 41 49 4 10985 \nCD 229 52 39 3 10470 \nDE 349 62 30 3 10089 \nFG 293 69 24 2 10588 \nGH 306 78 17 2 11083 \nI 405 85 11 1 10962 \nJ 35 86 6 1 11646 \nTotal 2278 57 35 3 11156 \nSource: New Jersey Department of Education 2004. \n \n'This is an electronic version of an article published in The Journal of Education Policy \nVol. 20, No. 4 (July 2005): 507-524.

How the NCLB accountability targets impact upon the \nState\u2019s attempts to provide the \u2018through and efficient\u2019 education demanded under its \nconstitution will be considered below. \n \nState testing and school accountability \nSince 1978, students in New Jersey have been assessed in grades 3, 6 and 9 or 11 in \nreading and mathematics. Over the past two decades, the testing regime has been revised \nand updated to include basic skills tests, curriculum content standards, accountability \nmeasures, public reporting of district level scores and high school graduation tests \n(Firestone et al 1997). When NCLB was implemented in 2002, students in New Jersey \nwere being assessed state-wide in Grade 4 (The New Jersey Assessment of Skills and \nKnowledge 4), in Grade 8 (the Grade Eight Proficiency Assessment) and in Grade 12 \n(The High School Proficiency Assessment). In 2003, 208 schools, or around 10% of New \nJersey\u2019s elementary and high schools, were identified as being \"in need of improvement\" \nfor a second year (New Jersey Department of Education 2003). These schools did not \nmeet all their Adequate Yearly Progress targets despite the fact that many did reach or \nexceed their targets in one of two content areas. The consequences of failing to make \nAdequate Yearly Progress for two consecutive years mean that parents are now free to \ntransfer their children to other schools in the district, while the school will continue to \nreceive technical assistance with its curriculum and teaching programmes. \n \nIn the following sections we look more closely at the key characteristics of these schools. \nBy comparing these \u2018failing\u2019 schools with other schools in New Jersey, and by taking into \naccount contextual features of these schools, we consider the extent to which the \nsanctions demanded under No Child Left Behind can be justified. \n \nThe characteristics of New Jersey\u2019s schools \n'This is an electronic version of an article published in The Journal of Education Policy \nVol. 20, No. 4 (July 2005): 507-524.

These report cards provide contextual and performance data for all of New \nJersey\u2019s schools and school districts. In this analysis schools were allocated to one of \nthree groups: schools that failed to make AYP for two consecutive years, schools in the \nAbbott districts and schools who were neither Abbott schools nor failed to make AYP \n(here designated as \u2018other\u2019 schools). Some of the characteristics of these schools were \ncompared with those of all New Jersey schools and appear in table 2 below. \n \n'This is an electronic version of an article published in The Journal of Education Policy \nVol. 20, No. 4 (July 2005): 507-524.

For example, all \nschools report similar attendance rates, proportions of students with disabilities and \nteachers with comparable salaries and levels of experience. However, more often, the \nschools which fail to make AYP appear to be similar to the poorer Abbott schools, \nparticularly on indicators that may be considered as proxies for poverty. For example, \ncompared with New Jersey schools overall and the schools labelled as \u2018other\u2019, both \nAbbott schools and those that failed to make AYP have smaller proportions of students \nwho speak English as their first language at home, but higher student mobility rates and \nmore students with limited proficiency to speak English (LEP). Interestingly, although \nthe student suspension rate appears to be higher in Abbott and \u2018failing\u2019 schools, the \nstudent exclusion rate is slightly higher in schools designated as \u2018other\u2019. However, the \nproportion of students who are excluded from all schools in New Jersey is relatively \nsmall and slight trends like those seen here ought to be treated with caution.  \n'This is an electronic version of an article published in The Journal of Education Policy \nVol. 20, No. 4 (July 2005): 507-524.

Three-quarters of New Jersey\u2019s failing schools are located in the least \nwealthy, or category A districts, while only around 12% are located in the medium to \nhigh wealth areas (categories C or above).  \n \nTable 3: Success in New Jersey\u2019s schools, according to school district wealth category. \n \nDistrict \ncategory \nSchools not \nmaking AYP \nAbbott schools Other schools All schools \n N % N % N % N % \nA 149 74 360 78 31 2 398 17 \nB 28 14 81 18 171 10 263 11 \nCD 17 8 20 4 197 11 229 10 \nDE 6 3 0 0 343 19 349 15 \nFG 1 0.5 0 0 292 16 293 13 \nGH 0 0 0 0 306 17 306 13 \nI 0 0 0 0 405 23 405 18 \nJ 0 0 0 0 35 2 35 1 \nSource: New Jersey Department of Education 2004a. \n \nAnother concern raised by some critics of NCLB is that the strict rules for student \nsubgroups would mean that students from these groups would be over-represented in \npoorer or failing schools. These concerns are considered below. However, the New Jersey \nschool report card, from which much of the data used in this analysis was retrieved, \nprovides little detail on the demographic make-up of New Jersey\u2019s schools. In order to \nobtain some estimation of the proportion of students who may be from the various \nstudent subgroups, it is necessary to use data derived from the school\u2019s reporting of the \nnumbers of students from each subgroup who participated in state-wide tests, such as the \nGrade Eight Proficiency Assessment (GEPA). Unfortunately, this is an imperfect \nmeasure as it only tells us about the composition of the students in that grade, rather than \nabout the school as a whole.

This means that for a cohort of 160 students, if fewer than ten students were \nfrom a Hispanic background, the numbers of Hispanic students would not be displayed. \nWhere this happens, it is often possible to calculate the values for these suppressed cells \nby taking into account the numbers of students in the other student sub-groups, where this \nis not the case the numbers of students had to be estimated. Table 4 presents the \npercentage of students from the main student subgroups who participated in the GEPA \nliteracy tests in 2003. \n \nTable 4: Mean percentage of students from the main subgroups participating in GEPA(L) \n \nPercentage tested \nwho were\u2026  \nSchools not \nmaking AYP \nAbbott schools Other schools All New Jersey \nschools \nN  % N % N % N % \nAfrican-American  192 57 330 46 1297 9 1664 17 \nWhite 192 10 331 12 1298 72 1666 59 \nHispanic 192 29 330 37 1297 9 1664 15 \nAsian 192 2 332 2 1297 7 1666 6 \nGeneral Education 193 78 333 76 1306 83 1676 82 \nSEN 193 13 333 14 1306 14 1676 14 \nLEP 193 7 333 8 1306 3 1676 4 \nEconomically \ndisadvantaged \n193 74 333 75 1306 15 1676 28 \nNote: the total number of schools differs from those in the tables above for two reasons, in some schools \nsmall cell sizes are suppressed and had to be excluded, also earlier tables include schools with younger \nstudents who did not sit GEPA \n \nSchools categorised here as \u2018other\u2019, that is schools which were neither designated as \nAbbott nor schools that failed to make AYP, tested lower proportions of students from \nthe African-American and Hispanic communities and higher proportions of students from \nthe white community. These differences can, in fact be quite staggering. For example, in \nall of New Jersey\u2019s public schools, while around 17% of students who were assessed \nusing the GEPA were from the African-American community, almost 60% of these \nstudents were being taught in schools that were failing to meet state standards, according \nto NCLB.

Similar inequities can be found in the distribution of \nstudents from economically disadvantaged homes, who again were concentrated in \nschools that failed to demonstrate Adequate Yearly Progress towards full proficiency. In \nNew Jersey, students who do not follow special education programmes will follow the \n\u2018general education\u2019 route. The proportions of these students are lower in the Abbott \nschools and in those that failed to make AYP. \n \nTesting higher proportions of certain student sub-groups in \u2018failing\u2019 schools is only really \nan issue if these students actually achieve lower results. Using the GEPA literacy test as \nan example, table 5 shows the proportions of students from the various subgroups who \nachieved or surpassed proficiency levels in 2003. \n \nTable 5: Mean percentage of students making AYP in the GEPA literacy test \n \nStudent sub-group Number of schools Students making AYP (%) \nWhite  514 83 \nAfrican-American 283 52 \nHispanic 325 60 \nSEN 429 31 \nLEP 79 16 \nEconomically disadvantaged 406 53 \nAll students  655 73 \nSource: New Jersey Department of Education 2004a. \n \nStudents from the African-American and Hispanic communities were less likely to reach \nminimum proficiency levels on the GEPA literacy assessment than students from white \nfamilies. Students with LEP, SEN and from economically disadvantaged homes also had \nrelatively low success rates on this test. It is also apparent from table 6, that these less \nsuccessful students are concentrated in the least wealthy school districts. For example, in \nthe 159 district A schools, less than 10% of students came from a white background. This \ncontrasts with schools in more wealthy districts where the school population is \noverwhelmingly white. \n'This is an electronic version of an article published in The Journal of Education Policy \nVol. 20, No. 4 (July 2005): 507-524.

N=number of schools \n \nSo on the one hand, New Jersey has established a seemingly equitable school system, \nparticularly where control and change can make an impact at the institutional level, such \nas ensuring higher levels of funding for schools in less wealthy districts and similar \ndistributions of experienced and salaried teachers. However, differences are revealed in \nthe demographic make-up of New Jersey\u2019s schools which appear to confirm some of the \nfears of commentators who claim that NCLB, rather than making all schools accountable \nfor student progress regardless of the composition of their intake, has resulted in schools \nin poorer districts with large proportions of students from minority and disadvantaged \ncommunities being labelled as failures. This absence of value-added measures of school \nsuccess which take account of the prior attainment of students as well as their background \ncharacteristics, is important. We know from school effectiveness research both in the \nUSA and the UK that the school accounts for a relatively small proportion of the \nvariation in school academic outcomes, typically 8-20% and this includes error \ncomponents, with by far the largest variation in outcome being attributed to student \nbackground characteristics (Jencks 1972, Reynolds 1994, Sammons et al 1995). Relying \nsolely on uncontextualised raw test scores as a means of allocating success and failure to \nschools, fails to take account of important differences between the types of students who \nattend these schools, this, in turn, may result in otherwise successful schools being \nunfairly labelled as failing. \n'This is an electronic version of an article published in The Journal of Education Policy \nVol. 20, No. 4 (July 2005): 507-524.

This model was then used to predict the test \noutcomes for schools that did not make AYP in this period. For brevity, only the model \nrelating to achievement in the Grade Eight Proficiency Assessment in literacy (GEPAL) \nis described here, although the models produced for the other state assessments revealed \nsimilar patterns. The most powerful model related the proportion of students who \nachieved proficiency levels or higher in the GEPA(L) to a range of variables which may \nbe considered to be proxies for poverty, such as the proportion of students tested who \ncome from economically disadvantaged homes, and the relative distribution of local \nsources of funding for schools.

In this study, schools were designated as underachieving if \nthe z-score of the difference between their predicted and actual scores was less than \u20131.  \n \nConsider, for example school A which had failed to make Adequate Yearly Progress for \ntwo consecutive years and whose parents were being given the opportunity to move their \nchildren to other schools in that district. In this school, around 52% of students achieved \nproficiency levels or higher in the GEPA(L), while our model predicted that 40% of \nstudents would achieve this level. This means that, on this model, students in this school \nactually did better than expected, when the variables listed in table 7 were taken into \naccount. Therefore, on this measure, there is no evidence to suggest that this school was \nunderachieving. In fact, 53% of the 112 schools which, on raw score measures were \nlabelled as failing under No Child Left Behind were, when background characteristics are \ntaken into account, actually achieving higher sores than expected and therefore \nincorrectly labelled as failing. On the other hand, consider school B. This school is \nlocated in a relatively wealthy FG category district. The school was making AYP and, \nwith 62% of students achieving proficiency levels or above on GEPA(L), was not subject \nto any of NCLB sanctions. However, on our value-added model, over 78% of students \nshould have been working at or above proficiency levels \u2013 so on this measure, this \nseemingly successful school was actually \u2018underachieving\u2019. \n \nDiscussion \nAnalysis of early results from state-wide assessments that are linked to the No Child Left \nBehind accountability requirements suggest, that in New Jersey at least, some of the \nconcerns voiced by critics of the legislation appear to be well founded. Although \n'This is an electronic version of an article published in The Journal of Education Policy \nVol. 20, No. 4 (July 2005): 507-524.

Schools that are failing to demonstrate Adequate Yearly Progress are \noverwhelmingly those that are located in the poorer school districts and who serve \ndisproportionately larger numbers of students who traditionally do less well in school, \nsuch as students from economically disadvantaged homes and who come from the \nAfrican-American community. On the other hand, schools located in the more wealthy \nschool districts were more likely to serve larger communities of white students who were \nperforming at higher levels on the state assessments. These schools were more likely to \nmeet New Jersey\u2019s accountability targets. The use of a value added model to account for \nthe failure of schools to make AYP revealed that around 50% of schools were incorrectly \nlabelled as failing and, it could be argued, being unfairly subjected to the punitive \nsanctions that are administered to schools that fail to make AYP for two consecutive \nyears. \n \nHowever, it has to be remembered that these are still early days. The need to take a \nlongitudinal perspective on the development of this Act is crucial. If the legislation is \nactually seen to make an impact on the achievement of the lowest achieving groups of \nstudents then perhaps its dissenters will be encouraged to think again. Even so, how No \nChild Left Behind will continue to work in practice does remain to be seen. Some \ncommentators foresee a shift from the current relatively coercive accountability measures \nthat underpin the first manifestations of the Act, to \u2018softer\u2019 measures in which the \nconsequences of failing to meet annual accountability targets will be less severe (Hess \n2003, Hanushek 2003, West and Peterson 2003). Recent concessions over the assessment \nof students with SEN and LEP, the designation of highly qualified teacher certification \nand the minimum numbers of students required for test participation might suggest a \nsoftening of accountability measures (Popham 2004a, Department of Education 2004a). \nThe use of the Act\u2019s \u2018safe-harbour\u2019 provisions may also be developed to allow increased \nflexibility in demonstrating AYP, particularly for some student sub-groups.
