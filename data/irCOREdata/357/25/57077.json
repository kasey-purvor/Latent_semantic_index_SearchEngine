Men having\nsex with men, injecting drug use and having multiple sexual partners are well-established\nrisk behaviours for transmitting the HIV virus. People with schizophrenia are more likely\nto engage in these behaviours than the general population and as a result there is an\nincreased prevalence of HIV infection in this group. However, many contemporary men-\ntal health policy reports fail to discuss the risk of HIV\/AIDS in people with schizophre-\nnia, and there are few specific references to sexual health promotion in these documents.\nPeople with schizophrenia should be considered an at-risk population for HIV infection\nand other sexually transmitted diseases. Psychiatric research, policy and clinical practice\nneed to develop rapidly to address this important aspect of a major public health\nproblem.\n \nKeywords\n \n: AIDS, HIV, policy, practice, schizophrenia, sexual health \n \nBackground\n \nThe human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection epi-\ndemic represents one of the most serious public health\nproblems of modern times. Since the onset of the pandemic\nat least 21.8 million people have died from acquired immu-\nnodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and at least 36 million are\nliving with HIV infection\/AIDS (WHO 2000). In 1999\nworld-wide, 5.3 million people were newly infected with\nthe virus. Historically, epidemiological studies have shown\nthat intravenous drug users and men who have sex with\nmen (MSM) were most at risk of HIV infection. However,\nin the last few years there has been an increase in the pro-\nportion of people with HIV infection where transmission\nwas through other risk behaviours. In most countries there\nhas been considerable effort to increase public awareness of\nthe HIV problem through preventative educational cam-\npaigns (Di Clemente & Peterson 1994). However, scant\nattention has been paid to people with schizophrenia, an\nalready vulnerable and disenfranchised section of the com-\nmunity, who should rightly be considered a population at\nhigh risk of HIV infection (Grassi \n \net al\n \n. 1999).\nIn the year 2000, the prevalence of HIV infection among\nthe adult population aged 15\u201349 years was 0.11% in Brit-\nain and 0.35% in western Europe (WHO 2000). The main\nmode of transmission in both Britain and western Europe\nwas through men having sex with men (WHO 2000).\nRecent research in the United States of America (USA) has\nshown alarmingly high rates of HIV seropositivity among\npeople with serious and enduring mental disorders (of\nwhich the majority have schizophrenia), ranging from 9%\nto 19% (Cournos \n \net al\n \n. 1991, Volavka \n \net al\n \n. 1991, Susser\n \nAccepted for publication\n \n: 8 March 2002\n R. Gray \n \net al.\n \n406\n \n\u00a9 \n \n2002 Blackwell Science Ltd, \n \nJournal of Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing\n \n \n \n9\n \n, 405\u2013409\n \net al\n \n. 1993, Silberstein \n \net al\n \n. 1994). The few prevalence\nstudies that have been conducted in western Europe also\nshow an increased prevalence rate of around 5% in people\nwith schizophrenia (Naber \n \net al\n \n. 1994, Ayuso-Mateos \n \net al\n \n.\n1997). These prevalence figures suggest that around 2%\n(4000\u20135000) of people with schizophrenia in the United\nKingdom (UK) are currently living with AIDS\/HIV.\nPerhaps the most important observation in the preva-\nlence studies was that clinicians working with people with\nschizophrenia were unaware of the increased risk of HIV\/\nAIDS in this population and made little effort to screen\npatients for seropositivity, possibly because of ethical issues\nsurrounding the ability to gain informed consent, and the\nlack of available pre- and post-test counselling (Cournos\n \net al\n \n. 1991). This is alarming because once a patient tests\npositive for HIV risk-taking behaviours can be addressed\nand treatment started. This finding suggests that HIV\/AIDS\nis not being well managed in this population and because\ntreatment is delayed people with schizophrenia who are\nHIV positive are likely to have a worse outcome than the\ngeneral population. The poor HIV-positive detection rate\nmay also be explained by a widely held belief among cli-\nnicians that people with schizophrenia do not have sex. For\nexample, Akhtar & Thomson (1980) observed that initially\npeople with schizophrenia have an increase in sexual activ-\nity that lessens over the course of the illness, frequently\nresulting in marked hyposexuality. If this is true, then cli-\nnicians may perceive that promoting sexual health in their\npatients is a fairly low priority. However, the prevalence of\nHIV in this group compared with the general population\nsuggests that people with schizophrenia may be sexually\nactive and engaging in risky sexual practices and\/or inject-\ning drugs.\n \nDo people with schizophrenia have sex?\n \nIt has long been recognized that people with schizophrenia\nhave lower reproduction rates than the general population\n(Nimgaonkar \n \net al\n \n. 1997). Sexual disinterest and dysfunc-\ntion have been attributed to both the disorder and the\nside-effects of antipsychotic medication (Gray 1999). High\nrates of depression have also been observed in people with\nschizophrenia (associated with a loss of interest in sex;\nGotesman & Groome 1997) and psychotic symptoms such\nas delusions and hallucinations may make it difficult for\npeople with schizophrenia to form and maintain lasting\nrelationships. These problems do not, however, eliminate\nthe desire for sexual contact (McEvoy \n \net al\n \n. 1983) or leave\npeople sexually inactive (Kelly \n \net al\n \n. 1992).\nContrary to the prevailing clinical stereotypes, people\nwith schizophrenia (at least in America) are sexually active\n(Cournos \n \net al\n \n. 1994). For example, Cournos \n \net al\n \n. (1994)\nfound that 44% of people with schizophrenia had been reg-\nularly sexually active in the previous 6 months. The fre-\nquency of sexual activity in psychiatric inpatients and\ncontrols was compared in a study by McDermot \n \net al\n \n.\n(1994), who found no difference between the groups. Each\ngroup reported an average of 11 sexual contacts in a typical\nmonth.\n \nRisk behaviours\n \nPeople with schizophrenia, who have sex, do appear to be\nmore likely to engage in known high-risk sexual behav-\niours. In a study by Cournos \n \net al\n \n. (1994) condom use was\nvery low (around 8%), drug or alcohol use during sex was\ncommon, as was sexual exchange (for money, drugs or\nother goods). Patients often had multiple sexual partners\nand around 12% of those who were sexually active had sex\nwith a partner who was a known injecting drug user. Anal\nsex appeared to be common among people with schizo-\nphrenia (around 11%), although the majority of men who\nhad sex with men did not classify themselves as being gay.\nFinally, research in the UK has established that around a\nthird of people with schizophrenia have a substance misuse\nproblem; although injecting drug use is rare (around 1\u2013\n2%), those who do, tend to use contaminated equipment\nand share needles (Wright \n \net al\n \n. 2000). It is widely accepted\nthat the risk behaviours for HIV infection are anal sex,\ninfected intravenous injecting equipment, sex with intrave-\nnous drug users and MSM (Centres for Disease Control &\nPrevention 1995). As people with schizophrenia are more\nlikely to engage in these activities, this may begin to explain\nthe high rate of seroprevalence in this population.\n \nHIV\/AIDS awareness\n \nAmerican research seems to suggest that the level of HIV\nawareness among people with schizophrenia is substan-\ntially lower than in the general population. For example,\nAruffo \n \net al\n \n. (1990) found that women with schizophrenia\nknew significantly less about HIV and how it was trans-\nmitted than a control group. Structured interviews were\nused by Kalichman \n \net al\n \n. (1994) to test knowledge about\nHIV in 95 psychiatric outpatients (82% had schizophre-\nnia). Important deficits in knowledge were reported. For\nexample, 37% believed that showering after sex can pre-\nvent you from getting HIV, 26% thought that a person\nmust have multiple sexual partners to get the virus and\n24% reported that a person who got the HIV virus from\ninjecting drugs could not transmit the virus to someone else\nby having sex. Kelly \n \net al\n \n. (1992) used a questionnaire to\nassess knowledge of HIV risk behaviour among 60 patients\nwith chronic mental illnesses (70% had schizophrenia) and\n \u00a9 \n \n2002 Blackwell Science Ltd,  \n \nJournal of Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing\n \n \n \n9\n \n, 405\u2013409\n \n407\n \nHIV infection and schizophrenia\n \nagain knowledge was poor. For example, 53% believed\nthat most people become sick quickly after getting the HIV\nvirus, just under half reported that people who can give you\nthe HIV virus always look sick and around a third of\nrespondents stated that only MSM get AIDS.\nIt is important to be cautious when generalizing Amer-\nican research to the UK. However, as there are no published\nstudies undertaken in the UK, it is reasonable to propose, at\nleast as a testable hypothesis, that there are similar deficits\nin knowledge about HIV\/AIDS among people with schizo-\nphrenia living in Britain. The deficits in knowledge are\nsurprising, given the massive multimedia, public education\nprogrammes in both the UK and America since the 1980s.\nIt is possible that some of the symptoms of schizophrenia,\nespecially the effects on cognitive functioning and disor-\ndered thought processes, are barriers to effective HIV\/AIDS\nawareness. This may explain why the prevalence of HIV\ninfection is higher in people with schizophrenia. These find-\nings may also indicate that information needs to be pre-\nsented in a different way and that interventions that have\nbeen shown to be effective in the general population may\nnot automatically be translated for use with people with\nschizophrenia.\n \nHealth behaviour change\n \nIn the general adult population, it is clear that simply giving\npeople information about HIV\/AIDS, at least on its own,\ndoes not change behaviour (Angleton 1989, Greenblat\n \net al\n \n. 1989). So called \u2018fear-arousal\u2019, as seen in the early\nmass media campaigns on AIDS, is similarly generally inef-\nfective (Sherr 1989). The same appears to be true among\npeople with schizophrenia. For example, McKinnon \n \net al\n \n.\n(1996) found no reduction in HIV risk behaviour among\npatients with greater knowledge about AIDS.\nInterventions that appear to be effective in changing\nbehaviour in the general population include those that\naddress patients\u2019 health beliefs and help people develop\nnew skills, such as negotiating condom use (Aggleton 1997,\nStoller & Rutherford 1989). However, the impact of health\nbeliefs on people with schizophrenia may be different from\nthe general population. For example, McDermott \n \net al\n \n.\n(1994) showed that different factors predicted changes in\nsexual behaviour among people with schizophrenia and\nhealthy controls. In controls, a combination of AIDS\nknowledge, perceptions of behavioural control and per-\nceived control over sexual thoughts and behaviour, pre-\ndicted changes in high-risk behaviour. Changes in the\nsexual behaviour of people with schizophrenia, by con-\ntrast, were associated with perceptions of cognitive control,\na belief that one can reduce one\u2019s risk of AIDS by changing\none\u2019s behaviour, and a belief in the future development of\ntreatment for AIDS. These results emphasize the need to\ndevelop, or at least tailor, interventions to meet the differ-\nent needs and beliefs of people with schizophrenia.\nThree American randomized controlled trials have used\nthese ideas to develop targeted interventions for people\nwith schizophrenia and have produced promising results\n(Kalichman \n \net al\n \n. 1995, Kelly 1997, Weinhardt \n \net al\n \n.\n1998). For example, Kalichman \n \net al\n \n. (1995) gave patients\nfour 90-minute behavioural skills training sessions that\nresulted in a significant reduction in unsafe sexual\npractices.\n \nCurrent practice\n \nThe available evidence strongly suggests that people with\nschizophrenia are at an increased risk of HIV infection and\nhave important deficits in their understanding about the\ndisease. Despite this body of evidence, mental health pro-\nfessionals in the UK appear to fail in the detection of\npatients who are HIV positive, and generally do little to\npromote the sexual health of their patients (Cournos \n \net al\n \n.\n1991, Park Dorsey & Forchuk 1994).\nAccording to Firn (1997) many mental health profes-\nsionals avoid discussing sexual health issues (and conse-\nquently HIV\/AIDS) because of a fear of appearing to\nencourage or condone sexual expression in whatever form.\nThis prevailing attitude is perhaps a consequence of the \u2018no\nsex\u2019 policy that exists in many psychiatric hospitals, pre-\nsumably to protect vulnerable patients. These policies often\nstate that sex on the wards or in the hospital is strictly for-\nbidden. However, as has already been established, patients\nare sexually active. As a result fairly obvious sexual health\ninterventions, such as providing condoms to patients free\nof charge, potentially reducing the risk of HIV transmis-\nsion, cause great debate among mental health profession-\nals. Some are concerned that the provision of condoms or\nthe discussion of sexual issues will lead to an increase in\nsexual activity.\n \nMental health policy and HIV\n \nThe National Service Framework for Mental Health\n(Department of Health 2000) makes no mention of sexual\nhealth. Neither do two recent reports looking at problems\nin acute psychiatric inpatient care: \n \nAddressing Acute Con-\ncerns\n \n (Standing Nursing and Midwifery Advisory Commit-\ntee 2000) and \n \nAcute Problems\n \n (Sainsbury Centre for\nMental Health 1998). The sexual health policies of many\nmental health NHS Trusts are hopelessly out of date, many\nsimply stating that psychiatric inpatients are not allowed to\nhave sex whilst an inpatient (Firn 1997). One policy from\na south London mental health Trust states that: \u2018Sexual\n R. Gray \n \net al.\n \n408\n \n\u00a9 \n \n2002 Blackwell Science Ltd, \n \nJournal of Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing\n \n \n \n9\n \n, 405\u2013409\n \nactivity involving patients on hospital premises is not an\nacceptable form of behaviour\u2019.\n \nConsiderations for research, policy and clinical \npractice\n \nIt seems highly likely that people with schizophrenia in the\nUK are at an increased risk of HIV infection because they\nengage in high-risk behaviours, most notably men having\nsex with men. Psychiatric research, policy and clinical prac-\ntice have failed to adequately address the problem and as a\nresult people have, avoidably, become infected with the\nHIV virus. In the UK, research, policy and clinical practice\nneed to develop rapidly and in parallel to address this prob-\nlem. There is an urgent need to establish the prevalence of\nHIV infection among people with schizophrenia through-\nout the UK. It is then necessary to understand the mode of\ntransmission in these individuals and their understanding\nand beliefs about HIV\/AIDS. These data can be used to\ndevelop and\/or refine interventions to change the behaviour\nof people with schizophrenia and then inform policy and\nclinical practice.\nMental health policy and practice cannot wait for the\nresults of studies that may take many years to complete.\nPolicy makers need to consider the sexual health (and\nexpression) of people with schizophrenia as an important\npart of their overall health. The inclusion of harm reduc-\ntion interventions (such as the availability and supply of\ncondoms) and the early detection of HIV-positive status\nas part of national and local policy is a critical first step.\nChanging the clinical practice of mental health profession-\nals presents a substantial challenge. It is unlikely that\nresearch and policy will, at least in the short term, impact\non the care and treatment that patients receive. The only\neffective method of changing clinical practice is training\n(Gray 2001). However, training is expensive and time con-\nsuming and careful consideration would need to be given to\nhow an effective training intervention could be dissemi-\nnated rapidly throughout the NHS.\n \nConclusion\n \nHIV infection in people with schizophrenia is a serious but\nlargely ignored part of the HIV epidemic. People with\nschizophrenia should be considered to be an at-risk popu-\nlation who warrant special attention. Much could be done\nin terms of research, policy and clinical practice, especially\ndeveloping, testing and implementing methods of improv-\ning early detection of HIV-positive status and simple risk-\nreduction strategies. However, mental health professionals\nappear reluctant to talk about sexual health and until they\ndo, people will continue to become infected.\n \nReferences\n \nAkhtar S. & Thomson J.A.
