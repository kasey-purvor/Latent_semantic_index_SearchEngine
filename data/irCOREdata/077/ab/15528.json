Although the banner of geopolitics groups \ntogether a variety of approaches, these studies more or less cohere around a very \nparticular type of imaginative geography of place \u2013 as violent and Political. Recent \narguments for cosmopolitan approaches to place \u2013 particularly when encountering non-\nEuro\/American sites \u2013 are used to argue for more diverse approaches to places such as \nPalestine within Anglophone geographical scholarship. Using research on Palestinian \nfamily spaces and spacings, an alternative approach is outlined that exposes some \ngeographies of dealing with and getting by the Israeli Occupation that are largely ignored \nby geopolitical approaches. These tropes prompt a return, in the conclusion, to the \nquestion of how geographers analytically apprehend power and violence, and the \npossibilities for doing this at the limits of, and beyond, the framework of geopolitical \nanalysis. \nIntroduction \nOver the last ten years, Palestine and Palestinians have become an increasingly popular \ntopic in\/for Anglophone geographical analysis. The temporality of this interest roughly \ncoincides with the beginning of the second Palestinian intifada (uprising, literally: \n\u201eshaking off\u201f), the 2001 September 11th attacks in the US and subsequent US-led \u201ewar on \nterror\u201f, and broader scholarly interest in a whole series of violent geographies (see for \nexample Gregory & Pred 2007). It is therefore not surprising that geopolitics \u2013 a term I \nuse rather loosely to group together a whole series of approaches including classical, \ncritical, feminist, urban and neoliberal geopolitics \u2013 has been an important \nepistemological register for analyzing some of these geographies. As I will outline in the \nnext section, this is particularly the case with regards to Palestine (or as it is frequently \nconceived in geopolitical studies, Israel\/Palestine). \n2 \n \n \nIf classical geopolitics can be conceptualized as the realist study of the geographical basis \nof statecraft and politics with an eye to policy recommendations (Sparke 2009, Dalby \n2008), then critical geopolitics might be thought of as the study of the geographical \nimaginations and cultures underpinning the discourses and practices from which state, \nand increasingly other forms of power, emerge (Sparke 2009, O\u201f Tuathail 2009). More \nrecent geopolitical analyses have extended the ethos of critical geopolitics under a series \nof different headings. Hyndman (2004: 309) has argued for more feminist geopolitical \nstudies that are distinguished from critical geopolitics \u201eby adding a potentially \nreconstructive political dimension\u201f (see also Hyndman 2001, 2007, Dowler & Sharp \n2001, Secor 2001), and similar arguments have been made about the need for a more \nnormative dimension within critical geopolitics itself (Megoran 2008). Roberts et al \n(2003) have argued that a neoliberal geopolitics is needed to understand contemporary \npolitical geographies in light of neoliberalism and globalization, while Cowen & Smith \n(2009: 24) argue that \u201econtemporary shifts in the spatialization of political, economic and \nsocial power\u2026 lead beyond geopolitics\u201f, and thus are better captured by a geo-economic \nconception of space. Dalby (2008: 415) argues that it is possible to use these varied \napproaches to inform critical geopolitical scholarship, rather than displacing it. Despite \nthe many intricate differences in these approaches, all of them remained linked by their \nanalysis of geographical basis of politics across a series of spatial and temporal extents. \nNevertheless, critical geopolitics remains a subject area that is hard to clearly delineate. \n \nWe should resist temptations to delimit critical geopolitics by subject matter, \ntheoretical concerns or methodology. Such limitations would create an illusion of \ninternal coherence and external differentiation that this work does not possess or \nclaim (Kuus forthcoming: n.p.). \n \nCritical geopolitics is no more than a general gathering place for various critiques \nof the multiple, geopolitical discourses and practices that characterize modernity \n(O Tuathail 2010: n.p.) \n \n3 \n \nIn the spirit of recognizing and working with the plural and contested nature of \ngeopolitical scholarship (critical, feminist, neoliberal and otherwise) as a loosely \norganized sub-discipline, this paper will both recognize the role such work can play in \nanalyzing Palestinian space and, in keeping with the theme of this special issue, offer an \nalternative approach to envisioning and encountering Palestine. The paper begins with an \nexamination of how Palestine has been produced by a range of geopolitical analyses. I \nargue that Palestine is frequently apprehended by geographers through the \nepistemological lens of geopolitics (of various kinds), and that the collective effect of \nsuch studies is to create a rather singular ontological representation of Palestine. Palestine \nbecomes stereotyped as a place of violence and suffering, and in this process Palestinians \nthemselves can become discursively erased as active subjects. \n \nSome more recent studies that envision Palestine in different ways are then reviewed. \nCrucially, these studies don\u201ft ignore the violence of occupation, but rather seek to \nforeground more prosaic practices of dealing with it or simply \u201egetting by\u201f (Allen 2008, \nHammami 2004). In this paper I seek to contribute to and develop these alternative \napproaches by drawing on eleven months of ethnographic research in the village of \nBirzeit. In particular I explore the family practice(s) of living in the Spanish Apartments, \nan apartment building in Birzeit. While the family can be conceived of geopolitically, the \nset of intimate cultural, economic and social geographies that I foreground leads instead \nto a broadening of the grounds on which politics is encountered and apprehended in \nPalestine. I use these insights to reflect on some of the politics and practices that circulate \naround critical geopolitical representations of \u201eother\u201f spaces, and our ability (as \ngeographers) to think about power and violence through different epistemological \nregisters. \nGeopolitics, Stereotypes and Palestine\/Israel \nThere have been a significant number of geopolitical studies that have helped elucidate \nthe relations between power and space, politics and geography in Palestine, particularly \nwith regards to Israeli colonization and occupation. Geopolitical analyses of Palestine \nhave produced a series of insights about the geographies of territory, borders and \n4 \n \npower\/knowledge. However, such studies, through the repetition of tropes of violence \nand politics, work at a collective level to produce \u2013 albeit unintentionally and \nunknowingly \u2013 a stereotypical representation of place. In other words, geopolitical \nstudies of Palestine are one of many forms of Western scholarship in which \u201edifferent \nplaces come to stand in, stereotypically, for certain kinds of events or processes\u201f \n(Robinson 2003: 279). In order to flesh out this argument, I begin by arguing that \ngeographical studies of Palestine(\/Israel) cohere around two particular themes. \n \nThe first theme that has been extensively explored in this context is territory and borders. \nThis includes work that has traced the shifting production of different territories and \nboundaries that constitute Palestine and Israel. (Falah 1997, 2003, 2004, 2005, Falah & \nNewman 1996, Newman 1996, 1997, 2001, 2002, Reuveny 2003).  Some of this work \nhas also produced a series of statements about state formation that seek to address \npoliticians, negotiators and diplomats, very much in the mould of what I have referred to \nabove as classical geopolitics (Falah 1996, Falah & Newman 1995, Newman & Falah \n1997, Arab World Geographer 2005). More recent work on territory has been attentive to \nthe ways in which the everyday practices (particularly those of the Israeli Occupation) \nhave produced Palestinian territories. Such work includes studies of land seizure and \ndisplacement (Falah 2003, 2004, 2005, Zureik 2003), the destruction of Palestinian cities \nand built environment (Falah 1996, Graham 2002, 2004, Abujidi & Verschur 2006), the \nconstruction of Israeli settlement-colonies in the Occupied Territories (Halper 2000, \nWeizman 2004, 2007, Campbell 2004, Zureik 2003) and the role surveillance and \nmobility play in striating these territories (Halper 2000, Harker 2009a, Parsons & Salter \n2008, Weizman 2007, Zureik 2001). There have also been studies of a similar ilk \nconducted in Palestinian spaces in Israel (Yiftachel 1991, 2002, 2006; Yiftachel & \nGhanem 2005) and other territories of Palestinian exile such as Lebanon (Ramadan \n2009).  This work on territories and borders has helped to explain the ways in which \nPalestinian spaces (national, municipal) are produced, and the constitutive role played in \nthese productions by different Israeli actors, and depending on the context, other Arab \nactors too. Such work has generated more general insights about how particular states are \nperformed and how boundaries are produced, reproduced and disrupted.  \n5 \n \n \nGeopolitical work on Palestinian territories has also been instrumental in unpacking the \ncontorted topologies of power\/knowledge embodied in such spatial formations. This \nsecond thematic includes studies that have explored the discursive construction of both \nPalestine (Gregory 2004, Weizman 2007, Gordon 2008), and Palestinians (Jamoul 2004, \nLong 2006, Ramadan 2009, Bhungalia 2010), and how these interconnected discursive \nconstructions are entangled with a range of material practices that have devastating \nconsequences for the spaces and bodies that they enroll and act upon (e.g. the destruction \nof Palestinian built environment). These studies bear a strong resemblance to Kuus\u201f \n(forthcoming) mandate for critical geopolitics: \u201eto illuminate and explain the practices by \nwhich political actors spatialize international politics and represent it as a \u201cworld\u201d \ncharacterized by particular types of places\u201f. Many in fact stretch this definition by \nextending the term \u201epolitical actors\u201f beyond the realm of statesman and militants. For \ninstance in Weizman\u201fs (2007) work, the performative spacings of the Israeli Occupation \nare enacted by subjects such as architects, planners and economists. Bhungalia (2010) \nalso makes the salient point that the geopolitical scriptings employed by the Israeli \nmilitary and politicians exclude Palestinian \u201eterrorists\u201f and \u201ecivilians\u201f from the realm of \npolitics (and political actors). \n \nBy recentering the analytic gaze from up on high to within embodied individuals, this \ngroup of studies has produced more variegated understandings of spatialized power in the \nOccupied Territories (e.g. Gregory 2004, Long 2006, Weizman 2007, Bhungalia 2010). \nHowever despite this, politics and violence, whether military, bureaucratic or state-based, \nprovides a common basis for geopolitical studies of Palestine(\/Israel). This is hardly \nsurprising, given the intense vulnerabilities many Palestinians experience while living in \n(and moving between) the Occupied Territories, the state of Israel and the manifold \nspaces of exile. In fact, it would be negligent and\/or na\u00efve to ignore such relations. This is \ncertainly not my intention here. What I do want to caution against is a relatively \nconsistent analytical focus that envisions and \u201eknows\u201f Palestine as a place of politics, \nconflict and violence. To clarify my argument once more: while many individual studies \n6 \n \ndo move beyond these foci, the reiteration of particular tropes at collective level creates \nstereotypes. \n \nWhile this is an epistemological critique, it also has ontological implications. As critical \ngeopolitics has clearly shown, particular representations of space actively participate in \nsocio-material \u201efabrications\u201f that have devastating consequences (Gregory 2004). In the \ncontext of Palestine, epistemologies of politics and violence actively participate in the re-\ncreation of spaces where Palestinians often have little agency (Bhungalia 2010). \nWeizman\u201fs (2007) study of Israel\u201fs Occupation provides the clearest example of this \nproblem. While the Israeli Occupation is the explicit focus of his work, the spaces in \nwhich Weizman\u201fs analysis moves are nevertheless Palestinian (too). However, the \noccupied are a derivative, of both the occupation and more importantly for my argument \nhere, of Weizman\u201fs analysis. Put differently, in exploring how Israel creates a land \nhollowed out of its Palestinian inhabitants, Weizman does much the same thing himself \nrhetorically. His analysis of the ontology of occupation bleeds into and comes to define \nan epistemology of Palestinian life.  \n  \nWeizman\u201fs work demonstrates how an ontological axiom of uneven power relations \nbetween Palestinians and their various \u201eothers\u201f (Israeli, Lebanese, Jordanian, etc), and the \nmultiple vulnerabilities they experience as a consequence, is translated into an \nepistemological axiom that dictates Palestinians can only be apprehended through politics \nand violence (and frequently as largely passive victims to such processes). This tacit \nconsensus, which I argue subsists in Geography because of the sheer number of \ngeopolitical studies of Palestine, can unintentionally reinforce inequitable power relations \nat a discursive level, and create one-dimensional representations of Palestine and \nPalestinians. This is problematic not only because it leads to the production of stereotypes \n(Palestinian as victim of occupation, or on the other side of the same coin, as hero of \nresistance), but also because it obscures a whole series of other social performances and \ntime-spaces. However, this epistemological consistency is, like any other, an achievement \nand thus liable to disruption. In the rest of this paper I seek to enact such a disruption in \norder to complicate representations of some of the Palestinians I have spent time with in \n7 \n \nthe West Bank, whose lives (and spaces) are far richer than many geopolitical \naccountings and, indeed, even this disruption. \nDifferent epistemological registers \nGiven the representational hegemony that I have argued is rooted in and routed through \ngeopolitical studies of Palestine, how might it be possible to move beyond this \nepistemological axiom? O\u201f Tuathail (1996) has proposed an anti-geopolitical eye as a \nway of resisting particular hegemonic geopolitical gazes. I read O\u201f Tuathail\u201fs anti-\ngeopolitical eye as a deconstructive approach to geopolitics, which seeks to undo \nhegemonic geopolitical discourses from within. Hence, any resultant scriptings of space \nstill remain within the orbit of geopolitical discourse, which in the context of Palestine \nstill turns around politics and violence. To counteract the tendency towards stereotypical \nrepresentations of place, Robinson (2003: 279) suggests that what is needed instead is a \nmethod for \u201elearning from the complex and rich experiences and scholarship of different \nplaces\u201f. In this vein, I am interested in an expanded geography of Palestine that works at \nthe limits of and goes beyond geopolitics. Such a geography does not reject geopolitics as \na mode of analysis, but rather seeks to situate it more modestly within an expanded field \nof intellectual and political endeavours concerned with the power-infused spaces and \nspacings of Palestine. Therefore such an approach does not seek to ignore or downplay \nthe role of violence and particular types of political process in Palestinian lives. Rather, it \nendeavours to situate and link such processes within a broader array of geographies.  \n \nThis argument is similar to Taraki\u201fs (2006), who underscores the need for contextualizing \nany work in Palestine within the ongoing Israeli occupation, while also calling for more \nsustained work in the social and cultural realm. \n \nThe political reality must be the basic backdrop against which we examine the \nroutines of life and the small dramas of daily life. (Taraki 2006: xii) \n \nA preoccupation with Palestinian political economy and political institutions has \nprecluded a serious study of social and cultural issues. (Ibid: xxvii) \n8 \n \n \nTaraki\u201fs argument is part of a broader current of scholarship seeking to expand the \nconceptual terrain on which Palestine is encountered (see also Stein & Swedenburg 2004, \nHammami 2004, 2006, Allen 2008, Kelly 2008). Much of this work lies outside the \ndisciplinary boundaries of Geography, but it is underpinned by an attentiveness to spatial \nrelations. While many non-geographical studies of Palestine and Palestinians have a \nspatial basis (given the importance of land and territory to Palestinian experiences), what \ndistinguishes the studies gestured to above is the complex ways in which they analyze \nspace as a site of power and social transformation. In what follows, I use the pluralizing \nethos that can be discerned in these studies as inspiration for my own attempt to think \nPalestine at the limits of and beyond geopolitics. In situating my work alongside these \nstudies, like Taraki I want to use a social-cultural analytical register to work towards a \nmore complex set of Palestinian geographies. I therefore turn to some of the specific \nfamily spaces and spacings that emerged during my research in Birzeit. \nGeographies of family  \nDuring the eleven months I spent in Birzeit, a village just north of Ramallah in the centre \nof the West Bank, the family and families emerged as important factors in my research. \nMy initial interests in homes, mobilities and place frequently weaved in and out of \nfamilial relations. For instance, when I discussed issues around im\/mobility with students \nat Birzeit University, the family was one of the most common motivations for what were \noften very difficult journeys around the West Bank (Harker 2009a). When I asked \nresearch participants what the word home evoked, I was repeatedly told things like: \n \nI look at home as the place I was born in, and the place that I have family in. It \nwill always connect me to my brothers and sisters. When there are holidays or \nsome religious occasions, we all go to that house and meet again.  \n(Interview with Samir, an English Language student, at Birzeit University, 19th \nApril 2006; interview conducted in English). \n \nA place where you combine family [\u2018a\u2019ila] and comfort. \n9 \n \n(Interview with Moussa, an engineer, in Birzeit, 25th June 2006; interview \nconducted in Arabic). \n \nFamily, being close to family, and having your own home. \n(Interview with Rula, a university employee, at Birzeit University, 21\nst\n February \n2006; interview conducted in English).\n1\n \n \nThese responses underscore three observations that emerged through participant \nobservation. Firstly, there is more to life in the West Bank than the Israeli Occupation, \nsomething that became increasingly clear to me during my eleven months in Birzeit. \nSecondly, the Israeli Occupation is nevertheless a very powerful force in spacing the lives \nof Palestinians living there (and indeed, elsewhere in world too). Thirdly, families and \nfamilial spaces are frequently means of dealing with the Israeli Occupation. I use the term \ndealing with here to refer to practices and relations that must encounter, and quite \nliterally \u201edeal with\u201f more hegemonic power relations (e.g. the Israeli Occupation), but \naren\u201ft explicitly forms of resistance to those power relations. In order to further explore \nhow this concept works with regards to families and family spaces in Palestine, it is first \nnecessary to unpack the concept of family itself. The discussion that follows is quite \nextensive, because as will be made clear, there is relatively little work within Geography \nthat theorizies the family. \n \nThe importance of family in my research presented quite a challenge for me because, as \nValentine (2008: 2098) has recently noted, the family is an \u201eabsent presence\u201f in \ngeographical research. While forming the backdrop to many geographical studies, \nfamilial relations are rarely the subject of much attention in and of themselves. For \ninstance, in economic geographies families are frequently aggregated to household level \nincome (e.g. Leinbach et al 1992, Moran et al 1996). Valentine (2008: 2100-1) notes how \nmore recent feminist work on social reproduction focuses on \u201ethe practical organisation \nof care rather than on the emotional ties, the meaning and quality of relationships, and the \n\u201cdoing\u201d of intimacy within \u201cfamilies\u201d defined more broadly\u201f. Furthermore, \n                                                 \n1\n All interviewees have been assigned pseudonyms. On defining home, see Harker 2009b. \n10 \n \n \nLittle or no consideration has been given by geographers to other forms of \nfamilial relationship beyond parent\/child: for example, between: adult children \nand their adult parents; siblings; grandchildren and grandparents; and wider \nfamilial networks of aunts\/uncles, cousins and step children\/stepparents. This \nrelative absence is particularly significant in the context of growing numbers of \nfragmented and reconstituted families or intra-familial negotiations across \nmultiple generations. (Ibid: 2101). \n \nThis lacuna in geographical research becomes even more notable when compared with \nthe extensive work that has been done to theorize familial relations in other academic \ndisciplines, including anthropology, sociology, history and critical legal studies. Such \nwork has examined how familial relations emerge from a variety of processes, which I \ngroup heuristically into discursive constructions of the family and family practices, \nalthough these overlap and bleed into one another\n2\n.  \n \nDiscursive constructions of familial relations produce \u201ethe family\u201f, a set of statements \nabout what a family is and how it should be done within a specific spatial and temporal \ncontext, (see examples in the work of Foucault 1978, Ong 1999). As Gillis\u201f (1996: xv) \nphrase, \u201ethe imagined families we live by\u201f suggests, discursive constructions have \npowerful material effects. These can include creating a \u201emodel\u201f nuclear family (Oswin \n2010), and constituting domestic and foreign policies (Cowen & Gilbert 2007) and legal \nregimes (Martin forthcoming) that are highly exclusionary. Sherif-Trask (2006) has also \nrecently noted how particular discourses of the Arab, Islamic and\/or Oriental family \n(often used interchangeably) underpin orientalist epistemologies of Arabic and Muslim \nsocieties and spaces. Joseph\u201fs (1993, 1999a, 1999b) work on \u201epatriarchal connectivity\u201f in \nLebanon stands as one of the few examples of work in an Arab world context that \ncritically explores how normative discourses of the family are (re)produced. \n \n                                                 \n2\n For a more extensive discussion see Harker forthcoming. \n11 \n \nIn many of the studies cited in the previous paragraph, discourses of family become \nblurred with family practices. Morgan (1996, 1999) develops the concept of family \npractices to analytically encircle the dynamic and active ways in which different families \nperform themselves in different social contexts. This approach treats family as a verb \nrather than a noun, a set of relations that are routinely \u201edone\u201f in situated contexts. \nMorgan\u201fs work is also an explicit response to the ways in which family remains a \nmeaningful and important concept despite the declining numbers of heteronormative two-\nparent families (in the implicitly British-Western context from which he writes). \nSubsequent work has extended the concept of family practices to explore sibling relations \n(Edwards et al 2006) and family spaces (Seymour 2007). Finch (2007) has argued for the \nimportance of \u201edisplay(s)\u201f. She argues that family practices must be recognized as such \nby others and by families themselves to be meaningful. In other words, family practices \ntake place amidst a range of family discourses that allow for such practices to be made \nmeaningful (as family practices). Her argument returns us to the intersection and \nentwinement of family practices and discourses. \n \nFollowing this work, I argue that family is a concept with interwoven discursive and non-\ndiscursive performative dimensions. While families are differently practiced in particular \ncontexts, these contexts are shaped by more extensive familial discourses that in turn are \nextended, reiterated and rejected through embodied practices. Families can therefore be \nthought about as dynamic and more or less precarious achievements in time-space. This \nproposed concept of family is inherently geographical. In order to recognize the \nimportance of space in discursively infused practices of family, I use the concepts family \nspaces: the temporal-spatial formations, relations and flows that are manifest by families, \nand family spacings: the processes through which family spaces emerge. While in \npractice these spaces and spacings are mutually constitutive, this conceptual separation \nallows for discussion of the processual nature of families (family as verb) alongside the \nmore commonplace understanding of family as a noun (see Harker forthcoming).  \n \nThere are two other aspects to theorizing family that are implicit in my discussion of \nfamilies as discursively-infused temporal-spatial performances. Firstly, families are \n12 \n \nresolutely material. Materiality here encompasses different assemblages of human and \nnon-human bodies. While the human bodies that comprise families may vary across a \nrange of ages (generations), genders, sexualities and ethnicities, they are also augmented \nby non-human relations such as dwelling spaces (e.g. houses), identity documents (e.g. \nbirth certificates, passports), communication technologies (e.g. mobile telephones), \ndomestic objects (e.g. televisions) and much else beside (see for instance Sheller\u201fs (2004) \nwork on cars, and Power\u201fs (2008) on dogs as family members). Secondly, families are \nresolutely social and affective. They are collective (more than individual) subjectivities \nemerging from specific social dis\/connections, affective flows and emotional ties, and \nthus form part of a more extensive set of geographies of intimacy (Valentine 2008) and \nrelatedness (Nash 2005). In the next section, I want to put this understanding of families \nto work in the context of my research in Birzeit in order to start to understand how \nPalestinian families deal with and get by the Israeli Occupation. I argue that such an \napproach offers a means through which geopolitical studies can be more attentive to \neveryday realities, while also producing Palestine as place in a way that extends and \nmoves away from some of the geopolitical conceptualization of Palestine with which I \nbegan this essay.  \nLiving in the Spanish Apartments \nIn Birzeit and Palestine more generally, family is predominantly conceptualized and \npracticed as \u2018a\u2019ila and hamula. \u2018a\u2019ila, the \u201esmall\u201f or nuclear family, is normatively \nproduced as father, mother and plural children. The \u2018a\u2019ila is complemented by hamula \n(sing. hama\u2019il), the \u201ebig\u201f family or clan, which is normatively produced as countless \ncousins, aunts, uncles, nieces and nephews. Birzeit currently consists of six hamula. \nThese definitions of family (thought of more precisely as fairly enduring discursive \nachievements) are not only based on composition, but also rooted in particular spatial \narrangements. In Birzeit, as elsewhere in Palestine (Amiry & Tamari 1989), families \noften live close together. Johnson\u201fs (2006: 92) survey data suggests that over 50% of \npeople in the central West Bank (where Birzeit is located) live in apartments or attached \ndwellings that they share with relatives. These numbers increase to over 90% in southern \nWest Bank and 80% in Gaza.  \n13 \n \n \nThis close association of living space with family space in the Occupied Territories has a \nparticular historical lineage. Landowning families (hamula) were prominent social and \neconomic players in the Ottoman era Levant (Kimmerling & Migdal 2003). Between \n1948 and 1967, when Jordon controlled the West Bank, hamula identification was \npromoted as a means of suppressing Palestinian nationalism (Hilal 2006, Gordon 2008). \nThe Israeli Occupation continued this practice when it invaded the West Bank and Gaza \nStrip in 1967. Village Leagues were created in 1978, a form of spatial governance that \ninvested family (hamula) heads with some, albeit limited powers. Although largely \nunsuccessful as a means of suppressing nationalism, the Village Leagues remained \nformally in effect until the first intifada in 1987 (Gordon 2008). Hence, even within a \ncontext of emerging nationalism, these (geo)political strategies by different occupying \npowers ensured that families (hamula) were important nodes of social belonging. The \nincreasing fragmentation of Palestinian space in the West Bank after the signing of the \nOslo Accords in 1993\n3\n, which has intensified since the outbreak of the second intifada in \n2000, has produced renewed forms of local practice and localism (Johnson 2006: 54) that \nenable, and often necessitate continued close association between family spaces and \nliving spaces. This brief historical sketch also highlights the connections that exist \nbetween the geopolitical practices of states and discursive constructions of the family that \nbleed into everyday family practices, although more detailed historical work would be \nneeded to fully substantiate this argument in this context. \n \nThe process of territorial fragmentation described in the previous paragraph has also \nsignificantly contributed to increasing spatial and social heterogeneity within the \nOccupied Territories (Taraki & Giacaman 2006). One example of this is the (statistical) \ndifferences between the central West Bank (where 50% of people live in apartments or \nattached dwellings that they share with relatives) and the southern West Bank (90%). In \n                                                 \n3\n The Oslo Accords divided the Occupied West Bank into three areas: Areas A (18% of the territory), B (22 \n% of the territory) and C (the remaining 60% of the territory), all divided by checkpoints, roadblocks and \nclosures that are policed by the Israeli Occupation Forces. While the Accords nominally offered \nPalestinians administrative control in areas A and B, and \u201esecurity\u201f control in area A, Israel continued to \ncontrol water aquifers below ground, the electromagnetic spectrum abover ground, and circulation and flow \nbetween all three areas, ensuring a de facto control of all areas and a continuation of the Occupation, albeit \nby slightly different means. (see Kimmerling & Migdal 2003, Weizman 2007, Gordon 2008). \n14 \n \nthe central West Bank, Ramallah and its hinterland (of which Birzeit is a part) is \nbecoming increasingly distinct, due to the concentration of political and economic power \nthere, while other West Bank cities face increasingly harsh closures (Taraki & Giacaman \n2006, Abourahme 2009). This has caused, inter alia, a large number of working aged men \nto migrate to Ramallah from other parts of the West Bank, which in turn has reduced the \noverall proportion of people living with their family in the central West Bank. Birzeit \nitself is also quite distinct with regards to the coincidence of family spaces and living \nspaces. The presence of Birzeit University, and thus large amounts of student \naccommodation in the village, mean that fewer people residing in the village live with \ntheir families than in other parts of Palestine. \n \nIn addition to this generally strong, albeit variegated, connection between family and \ndwelling space in Palestine, family space is understood in quite specific ways materially. \nIn the past, members of the same hamula would often build adjoining houses that formed \n\u201efamily\u201f courtyards (Amiry & Tamari 1989), as can be seen in Birzeit\u201fs Old City [medina \nqadima]\n4\n. Currently, the material dwellings in which families live together often take the \nform of multi-storey buildings, in which parents and (adult) brothers each live with their \nfamilies on separate floors. Often construction is accomplished in piece-meal fashion, \nand additional floors are added over a number of years as finance resources become \navailable. This shift from horizontal to vertical living offers a cheaper means of \nconstruction, since residents can build on land that is already owned without the need to \nbuy more. While this transition is the result of a number of factors, including the use of \ncement that is strong enough to bear the load of these increasing number of floors, \nperhaps two of the most significant dynamics in the West Bank have been the rapidly \nincreasing Palestinian population (Kanaaneh 2002) and decreasing amounts of living \nspace for this population as Israel continues to colonize the Occupied Territories\n5\n. As a \nresult, there is less land for parents to bequeath to offspring, and the cost of purchasing \n                                                 \n4\n This is discussed in much greater detail in Harker (2009b). \n5\n Similar dynamics (increasing population, declining space) have been noted among Palestinian populations \nwithin Israel (King-Irani 2007) and in Lebanon (Martin 2010). \n15 \n \nland has risen sharply\n6\n. Hence, indirectly, these material spaces of family are also \nentwined with particular colonial practices and their consequences. \n \nOne example of a contemporary family space in Birzeit that embodies this broader social-\nspatial norm is the house in which Waleed, the subject of the case study that follows, was \nborn and raised in. \n \nWaleed: My father has a house and so does my grandfather. Now they live with \nall my uncles. They all live together. Everyone has a small flat, with two \nbedrooms, one kitchen and one bathroom\u2026 My parents live with my brothers and \nsisters. Upstairs my uncle lives with my grandmother, three kids and his wife. \nAnother uncle lives with four children and his wife. Downstairs another uncle \nlives with his three kids and wife. And upstairs, another uncle has two sons. \n  \nHowever, Waleed himself lives in a building called the Spanish Apartments, and has \ndone so since his marriage in 2000. When I talked with him in August 2006, he had two \nchildren and his wife was expecting another one. The Spanish Apartments, also built in \n2000, are a series of five apartment buildings, constructed by the local Catholic Church in \nBirzeit using money from Spanish donors. They were built with the specific purpose of \nhousing young Christian families, something I discuss further in the next section. The \nconstruction of these apartment buildings fits within broader shifts from horizontal to \nvertical living. However, in a context in which sharing a home space is itself a well-\nrehearsed family practice (where family is understood as both \u2018a\u2019ila and hamula), \nWaleed lives with just his wife and children, surrounded by non-relatives (i.e. other \nfamilies that have bought flats in the Spanish Apartments). This family space is quite \nnovel and certainly a departure from the norm. Such a space therefore opens out on to a \nrange of alternative family and non-family spacings. I will focus on two that are \nconnected: firstly, a set of new materialities, and secondly, a set of novel non-kin social \n                                                 \n6\n In Palestine, land usually passes from a father to his children. Male heirs will receive a 2\/3 share while \nfemale heirs will receive 1\/3 share. Hence a rapidly expanding population leads to smaller plot sizes. This \nsystem maybe complicated, as is frequently the case in Birzeit, by relatives who have moved abroad and \nmay sell their share to relatives who remain living in the village. While many locals suggested that land \nwould rarely be sold in the past, it has become a valuable commodity in the present. \n16 \n \nrelations. As I will argue, these intimate spacings are indicative of social changes that can \nbe apprehended through an expanded geopolitical analytic, but in other ways elude this \nsame episteme. \nNew material spacings of family \nWaleed: As I said before I think it was a good idea [to build the Spanish \nApartments], but now with so many people and so many children, if you want to \nsleep after work, you can\u201ft because you hear someone playing in the street. If you \ntell him to stop playing and go home, maybe his father will get angry with you. \nThis isn\u201ft a major problem. We had a meeting for all the buildings and we said, \nyou should let your kids play from four to eight, because then if someone wants to \nsleep, he can sleep. It\u201fs good, but it\u201fs not very good. \n \nInterviewer: Because there are a lot of children? \n \nWaleed: Yes, and it\u201fs a small place. We need a garden and more things for the \nkids to do. We need more space for the cars. For instance if someone has a car \nand his wife also has one, where can you park the car?\n 7\n \n \nThe above quotation gives some sense of the ways in which Waleed\u201fs living space is \nentwined with a set of concomitant practices of other people\u201fs families (i.e. non-kin \nrelations). For example, his sleeping habits are related not only to the noise children \nmake, but also the relationships that exist between the children, their parents and Waleed. \nSince these sorts of non-kin relations are unusual in this context, Waleed experiences \nthem as problems. He diagnoses these changing geographies in very material ways, \nincluding the need for garden and car space. While such processes can be connected with \nbroader shifts from horizontal to vertical living, themselves wrapped up in a dynamic of \n                                                 \n7\n The interview with Waleed was conducted in a local restaurant (in Birzeit), in Arabic with the assistance \nof a translator, on 7th August 2006. Due to social norms, it was not possible for me to interview women \nalone, and hence the arguments I make in this essay draw on and reflect male perspectives or the \nperspectives of married couples speaking together. Hence one of the most significant limitations of my \nresearch was that I was not able to explore the gendered dynamics of kinship. While Jean-Klein (2001, \n2003) explores this issue during the first intifada, further contemporary study is needed in the wake of the \nsecond intifada. \n17 \n \npopulation expansion and territorial contraction, the changes also result from more \nintimate family geographies, such as Waleed\u201fs ability to negotiate with other fathers. An \neven more explicit example of these new material spacings of family occurs when \nWaleed has to go shopping. \n \nWaleed: I live on the top floor and since I have children it\u201fs a very big problem. \nAs I said it would be easier if we had a lift. When it was just me and my wife it \nwasn\u201ft a problem. We could just go and buy something from the supermarket and \ntake it home. But now you can\u201ft carry shopping and your kids at the same time. \nIt\u201fs very hard. They promised to build an elevator, but as I said, if I had a small \napartment of my own, I would leave the Spanish flats now. \n \nAs Waleed\u201fs family has changed, after his children\u201fs birth, his practices of family have \nalso had to adapt. Even a banal practice like going to the supermarket and carrying \nshopping home \u2013 the closest supermarket is in the same apartment complex \u2013 must be \nrenegotiated. This in turn has cultivated a desire, in concert with other things like the \nnoise and increasing rent, to live elsewhere. Changing (family) practices and materials, \ncaused by a change in the specific family subject, promotes the desire to change family \nspaces. However, this is a desire that is becoming increasingly difficult to realize due to \nincreasing land costs and declining plot sizes.  \n \nWaleed: I have some [land] along Jifna Street and we have some below the \nmunicipality, that\u201fs our land, not mine. It belongs to my father and his brothers. \nMy father is one of six brothers. And then, if you want to let someone take a small \npiece, for instance my father has one thousand six hundred dunams [1 dunam = \n1000m\n2\n, and so given the size of Birzeit, I assume Waleed meant to say 1.6 \ndunams], and I have two brothers, I\u201fll get three hundred meters. What can I do \nwith that? \n \nPalestinians living in the contemporary West Bank are confronting similar tensions \nbetween a desire for an ideal home (defined as house) and the messy negotiations \n18 \n \ninvolved in living in an actually existing home (Harker 2009b). Indeed, it is perhaps \nanalogous to similar processes elsewhere (Blunt and Dowling 2006). In this context, this \ntension and its roots in a more extensive dynamic of shrinking land-growing population \npoints to the ways in which geopolitical processes can be explored and analyzed \nthrough\/as home spaces (Harker 2009b), or as I argue in this paper family spacings. This \nis also true of emerging social spacings of family. \nNew social spacings of family \nWaleed\u201fs story about children\u201fs noise and disturbed sleep includes a reference to a \nresidence meeting in which \u201equiet times\u201f were agreed on. This is one of the ways in \nwhich new material spacings of family in the Spanish Apartments are entwined with a \nseries of social-spatial relations that differ from those found in more normative \u201efamily\u201f \ndwellings. \n \nWaleed: Every building has a small committee. They collect the money to pay for \nthe electricity, for maintenance, for the cleaner. Just for these things. We have a \nbig committee for big problems. If someone has a problem, each building, A, B, \nD, sends three people, and they form a small organization. This is for problems, to \nhelp someone with their problem. \n \nInterviewer: What would be an example of problem? Like, with the kids playing \nis that a problem? \n \nWaleed: I would speak with someone if my kids hit someone. I\u201fm talking about \nbig problems, such as strangers coming into our flats. If someone leaves his wife \nand somebody from outside comes in. And whenever we have problem with \nwater, in summer we don\u201ft have water, some days we do, some days we don\u201ft, so \nwe had a committee to solve the water problem. \n \nGoverning children, women and water become sites of a broader social negotiation, \nsituational improvisation and occasionally conflict that blur familial and non-familial \n19 \n \nspacings in and around the Spanish Apartments. The formation of an apartment \ncommittee bears a strong resemblance to the emergence of popular committees in refugee \ncamps (Rosenfeld 2004). These committees appeared after the nakba (catastrophe) in \n1948, to organize and administer the social and political life of camps in the absence of \nmore formal structures of governance. Similar committees were formed in villages during \nthe first intifada to organize resistance (Jean-Klein 2003), and continue to exist in \nvillages along the Green Line that are resisting the construction of the Israeli Occupation \nbarrier. All of these self\/local governance movements can be tied to a lack of Palestinian \npolitical representation within the Occupied Territories prior to 1994, when the \nPalestinian Authority (PA) was formed. Even after this date, weak and largely ineffective \n\u201enational\u201f governance has meant local governance is a necessity (even if such governance \ndoesn\u201ft seek to replace national governance aspirations, see Jean-Klein 2003). While \nsimilar forms of governance have emerged in a number of contexts throughout the world \n(see for example Simone 2010), what is significant in this case, is that this model of \ngovernance has been adopted by residences of the Spanish Apartments to deal with issues \nthat in other Palestinian contexts are addressed by and within families. In other words, \ngeopolitical processes and quotidian family practices and spacings are interconnected. \n \nHowever, the reworking of existing (governance) resources and emerging forms and \nspaces of social and familial practice in the Spanish Apartments are also interspersed \nwith more enduring family practices. Waleed mentioned that he still spends a great deal \nof time with his parents and brothers \u2013 the location of our interview was in a restaurant \nopposite his families\u201f building \u2013 and he still expresses a normatively-infused desire to \nbuild a single family home or have a domestic residence away from other families.  \n \nWaleed: [I]f I had a small apartment of my own, I would leave the Spanish flats \nnow.  \n \nInterviewer: So are you planning on getting a small apartment? \n \n20 \n \nWaleed: Yes, I don\u201ft want to spend all my life there. I\u201fm thirty years old now. I \nhave an idea at this stage of my life to build a small apartment [house], with two \nbedrooms, one kitchen, one bathroom, small. When I have money, I\u201fll do it. \nPalestinian families, the Israeli Occupation and geopolitics \nThe empirical observations made in the previous section are quite prosaic and may even \nseem unremarkable. They certainly provide a marked contrast with accounts of Palestine \nmarked by violence and the Israeli Occupation. It is of course possible to stage a \ndiscussion of Palestinian families along these lines by focusing on things such as the \nforced deportation of families and individuals, and the destruction of homes resided in by \nthe families of suicide bombers. Jean-Klein\u201fs (2003) research also illustrates the \ncontinuity between popular committee activism and kinship relations during the first \nintifada. These forms of Politics and violence often overshadow the much more \nextensive, banal and quotidian forms and acts of violence. I have already suggested that \nthe Israeli Occupation plays a role, either directly or indirectly, in the transition from \nhorizontal to vertical living and apartment governance. Another response to mundane and \nquotidian experiences of violence is migration. One of the reasons why the Spanish \nApartments were built was to prevent out-migration by young Christians\n8\n.  \n \nWaleed: The diocese went to the Spanish government to tell them they want to \nbuild a building for young people, as I said before, because they didn\u201ft want us to \ngo. They needed us in this country. They told him we need some land. The church \nsaid, we have some land, and they needed one hundred fifty thousand dollars up \nfront to begin. \n \nIt is estimated that in the period October 2000 to June 2001, 150,000 Palestinians left the \nWest Bank and moved to Jordan (Zureik 2003). From 2000 to 2006, 50,000 Palestinians \napplied to foreign consulates to emigrate from Palestine (Makdisi 2008: 8). Sofer\u201fs \ndescription of this migration as \u201evoluntary transfer\u201f (Makdisi 2008: 9-10) willfully \n                                                 \n8\n While Birzeit is a \u201eChristian village\u201f \u2013 local estimates suggest 60% of the population are Christian, with \nthe remaining 40% Muslim \u2013 the analysis of migration in this paragraph is not limited to Christains. \n21 \n \nignores the causes of such mobility, many of which involve military and bureaucratic \nviolence against Palestinians\n9\n (see also Graham 2002, Zureik 2003, Harker 2009a). \nMotivating factors include the difficultly of building a home due to declining living \nspace, itself a result of land theft and subsequent increases in costs for land purchase and \nhome construction as discussed earlier in the paper. The relatively excessive costs \nassociated with building a home in Palestine are exacerbated by what Roy (2007) terms \neconomic de-development (which has caused a long-term decline in incomes and capital \nsavings). In addition to these effects of occupation-related violence on Palestinian \nfamilies, the very definition of what constitutes a Palestinian family has itself been the \nobject of geopolitical dispute and violence. During the Oslo negotiations, \n \nA key definitional problem cropped up which remains unresolved to this day, that \nis, what constitutes a \u201efamily\u201f? Israel, for example, insisted that \u201efamily\u201f implies a \nnuclear-type family, and for the purpose of family unification the children must \nbe below the age of 16, whereas the Palestinian negotiators stressed that \naccording to Arab culture and practice, a family encompasses immediate and \nextended members. It is clear that each definition impacts the number and \ncategory of displaced family members, if and when they are allowed to return \nhome. (Zureik 2001: 219). \n \nIt is clear from the examples given thus far that families do not stand outside or apart \nfrom geopolitical processes. It is possible to focus on Waleed\u201fs desires and frustrations in \norder to trace the ways in which geopolitical processes are experienced and embodied in \nthe course of everyday Palestinian life in the Occupied Territories, whether through lack \nof sleep or climbing numerous flights of stairs. However, the families and family \nspaces\/ings I encountered during my research were never explicitly practiced as forms of \nresistance to the Israeli Occupation. Rather, these family practices constitute part of a \nmicropolitics of living that \u201edeals with\u201f, rather than \u201eresists\u201f, the Israeli Occupation. The \nphrase \u201edealing with\u201f conceptualizes practices that must encounter the Occupation, but \n                                                 \n9\u201e\u201cTransfer\u201d is a concept that has a long and established history in Israel; it is a euphemism referring to the \nremoval or expulsion of the indigenous, non-Jewish, population of Palestine\u201f (Makdisi 2008: 10).  \n22 \n \naren\u201ft explicitly carried out as forms of resistance to this incredibly extensive set of \npower relations. This notion of dealing with is similar to Allen\u201fs (2008: 456) concept of \n\u201egetting by\u201f, her answer to the question: \n \nHow can we acknowledge the power of violence in Israel\u201fs colonial project in the \noccupied territories without either assuming it to be all-determining of Palestinian \nexperience, or championing every act of Palestinian survival to be heroic \nresistance? \n \nWhile Allen\u201fs term \u201egetting by\u201f refers to practices that have emerged specifically in \nresponse to the violence of the Israeli Occupation, I use the term dealing with because the \nfamily space\/ings I have examined emerge from longer standing socio-cultural practices \nthat predate the Israeli Occupation, even as current manifestations must take place amidst \nit. I think this is important to emphasize, because it envisions Palestinian lives and spaces \nas more than just a reaction to, and thus beyond the singular ontic of, the Israeli \nOccupation. These powerful social and cultural practices - that a geopolitical episteme \nstruggles to attend to - frequently get written out of analyses of Palestine, even as they are \nvital to the creation of this place and various politically inflected practices therein.  \n \nTherefore, one of the concrete implications of thinking alongside Palestinian families as \nthey deal with and get by the Occupation has been how I represent this place. I focus on \nfamily practices and spaces in Palestine. Although what is signified by the noun Palestine \nis rather ambiguous, its use is a deliberate attempt to distance Palestine from the more \ncommonly used noun construct Palestine\/Israel. This noun construct is very important, \nsince it marks the numerous ways in which Palestinian lives have been (forcibly) \nentangled with Israeli lives, particularly through ongoing colonial occupation. However, I \nargue that an analysis of distinctly Palestinian family practices allows for the articulation \nof a more autonomous time-space: Palestine. In this instance, Palestine becomes a \nperformative utterance that acknowledges the relatedness of Palestinian spaces to Israeli \nspaces in a whole host of (largely inequitably) ways, but nevertheless attempts to \nreconfigure those relations. While such a maneuver is largely rhetorical, it gains force \n23 \n \nfrom the materialities of specific family spaces and spacings. In other words, this \nepistemological translation (from Israel\/Palestine to Palestine) is routed through changing \nintimate relations embodied in particular family practices. Waleed\u201fs family spaces\/ings \nare new to a certain extent, but also emerge from longer standing, normative practices \nand discourses of family that stretch beyond Israeli colonization in both time and space.  \n \nOf course, increasing distance and detachment can take a number of forms, not all of \nwhich are politically progressive, or necessarily actual forms of disengagement. \nAbourahme (2009) has recently argued that the \u201ebubble\u201f of urban modernity that \nsurrounds Ramallah and its region is another effect of colonial occupation, and \nspecifically Israel\u201fs efforts to destroy a coherent Palestinian national political \ncommunity. \u201eRamallah the bubble, Ramallah the enclave is also Ramallah the Bantustan, \neven if it doesn\u201ft always feel like it\u201f (Ibid: 503). This cautionary note not only serves to \nhighlight the importance of understanding the place in and from which Waleed\u201fs family \nspaces\/ings emerge (see also Taraki 2008), but also helps clarify my argument: what the \nperformative utterance Palestine seeks is a particular type of distance and disconnection, \nthat uncouples (rather than simply ignores) Palestinian lives from Israeli Occupation. \nConclusion  \nWhile it is vital to analyze and unpack the Israeli Occupation, the reasons for doing so, at \nleast to my mind, are as part of a broader effort to assist Palestinians in ending the \nOccupation. Many critical geographers seek to practice this sort of modest solidarity \nscholarship through their research, teaching and activism. However, doing so by focusing \nonly on geographies of Politics and violence presents a series of dangers. In this context, \nthese include producing Palestine as a land hollowed out of Palestinians, and frequently \nignoring the ways in which Palestinian refugees and diaspora living outside the Occupied \nTerritories are affected by such violence. Faced with this challenge, I have argued that \nmore cosmopolitan representations of place in general (Robinson 2003), and Palestine in \nparticular, can be intellectually and politically productive. This is not an argument for \nfewer geopolitical studies of Palestine and areas like it. Such studies have offered many \nthings, including efforts to re-envision the boundaries, territories and states, (see the \n24 \n \nspecial issue of the Arab World Geographer 2005), and the production of more \naffirmative representations of \u201eOthers\u201f that simultaneously critique and bridge discourses \nthat separate \u201eUs\u201f from \u201eThem\u201f (see Gregory 2004, Abu Zahra 2006). Rather, a greater \nrange of (geographical) analyses can broaden the terrain on which a politics of solidarity \nis enacted. Exploring family spaces and spacings in Palestine through a different analytic \nregister demonstrates that such families, while intertwined with the Israeli Occupation \nand the practices of the Palestinian Authority, aren\u201ft solely determined by these spatial \n(and temporal) political entities. Hence while these familial practices deal with living \nunder occupation, this involves a series of power relations that are not necessarily violent, \naren\u201ft experienced by Palestinians as forms of \u201epolitics\u201f (i.e. \u201eresistance\u201f), and do not \ncohere around the territorial spaces and practices of nation-states (and nation-state like \nentities). Furthermore, as Benvenisti (2008: n.p.) points out, discussions and negotiations \naround a one or two state \u201esolutions\u201f to the Israel\/Palestine \u201econflict\u201f will do nothing to \naddress \u201ethe dramatic gap in gross domestic product per capita between Palestinians and \nIsraelis, which is 1:10 in the West Bank and 1:20 in the Gaza Strip, as well as the \nenormous inequality in the use of natural resources (land, water)\u201f. The complexity of \nassessing and addressing such social and economic changes is precisely the reason why \ncritical scholarship must be based on multiple approaches to apprehending place(s), that \nare much more than simply sites of Politics and violence. Such approaches may include \nan expanded geopolitics (Hyndman 2007), which might even be called subaltern \ngeopolitics, but this analytic alone is insufficient for the reasons outlined above. \n \nMore generally, there is a danger that (critical) geopolitical scholarship fails to heed \nFoucault\u201fs (1983: xiv) maxim: \u201edo not become enamored of power\u201f10. One contemporary \nreworking of this caveat can be found in Butler\u201fs critique of work that has become \nfixated with sovereign exceptionality. \n                                                 \n10\n Along the same lines, I also note that Foucault\u201fs work \u2013 which has become axiomatic for understanding \npower \u2013 never intended to provide a general theory of power, but rather a set of situated investigations into \npower\u201fs application in various contexts.  \nFirst the analysis of these mechanisms of power that we began some years ago, and are continuing \nwith now, is not in any way a general theory of what power is. It is not a part or even the start of \nsuch a theory. This analysis simply involves investigating where and how, between whom, \nbetween what points, according to what processes, and with what effects, power is applied. \n(Foucault 2007: 1-2) \n25 \n \n \nIt is one thing to trace the logic of how constitutionalism secures the rights of the \nsovereign to suspect constitutional protections, but it is quite another to install this \nlogic as the exclusive way in which to apprehend the workings of contemporary \npower. If our attention is captured by the lure of the arbitrary decisionism of the \nsovereign, then we risk inscribing that logic as necessary and forgetting what \nprompted this inquiry to begin with: the massive problem of statelessness and the \ndemand to find post-national forms of political opposition that might begin to \naddress the problem with some efficacy. (Butler in Butler & Spivak 2007: 41). \n \nButler\u201fs critique emphasizes the dangers of focusing on particular relations of power in \nthe context of statelessness (something that resonates very strongly with many Palestinian \nexperiences). Through my discussion of family practices and the ways in which they are \nnot wholly attendant on (as in attend to, be attentive to) the Israeli Occupation, I hope this \npaper has similarly shown the potential for alternative types of engagement in this \ncontext and the reasons for pursing a more variegated geographical and geopolitical \nscholarship. \nAcknowledgements \nI am extremely grateful to Lauren Martin, Sara Koopman, Jo Sharp, three anonymous \nreviewers and Katie Willis for their perceptive and generous comments on earlier drafts. \nBibliography \nAbourahme, N., 2009.
