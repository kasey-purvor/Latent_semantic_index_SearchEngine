Res., 112, A05314, doi:10.1029\/2006JA011938.\n1. Introduction\n[2] High-frequency (HF) O-mode electromagnetic (EM)\npump waves may excite a number of instabilities in the\nionospheric plasma. On the timescale of milliseconds, the\nparametric decay instability (PDI) near the reflection layer\nof the pump wave leads to the enhancement of the electro-\nstatic Langmuir (L) waves traveling parallel to the magnetic\nfield line [DuBois et al., 1993]. Electron Langmuir (L) and\nion acoustic (IA) waves near the pump reflection altitude\nmay be produced by either weakly turbulent parametric\ndecay instabilities (PDIL) or the strongly turbulent oscillating\ntwo-stream instability (OTSIL) [e.g., Fejer, 1979; DuBois\net al., 1993]. The Langmuir turbulence occurs just below\nthe reflection height of the pump wave and causes enhance-\nments in incoherent backscatter power which is known as\nthe ion line enhancement effect [Jones et al., 1986;\nBirkmayer et al., 1986; Isham et al., 1999a; Rietveld et al.,\n2000; Djuth et al., 2004]. These enhancements are detected\nby incoherent scatter radars at the matching height, where the\npump frequency ( f0) matches the Langmuir waves\u2019 frequency\n( fL) with their wave vectors (k) equal to twice of that of the\nprobing ultra high frequency (UHF) radar wave (kUHF), i.e.,\nf0 = fL(k = 2kUHF) [Rietveld et al., 2000]. The HF reflection\nand matching altitudes can be up to 10 km apart and are\nsimply related [Stubbe et al., 1992].\n[3] In addition, the thermal parametric instability (TPI)\nnear the upper hybrid (UH) resonance altitude, which occurs\na few kilometers below the pump wave reflection altitude,\nstimulates UH waves propagating across the magnetic field\nlines. Small-scale (\u000110 m) field-aligned striations (FAS), or\ndensity depletions, are the result of UH turbulence, which can\nbe excited by the thermal oscillating two-stream instability\n[e.g., Das and Fejer, 1979; Dysthe et al., 1983]. Large-scale\nFAS (hundreds of meters to kilometers) are the result of\nthermal self-focusing instabilities [e.g., Grach et al., 1977;\nGuzdar et al., 1996]. UH waves trapped inside the FAS cause\nohmic heating of the plasma inside the depleted region which\nresults in further depletion and growth of the field-aligned\nirregularities over a timescale of \u0001100 ms to few seconds\n[e.g., Vas\u2019kov and Gurevich, 1976; Dysthe et al., 1982]. This\neffect leads to wide-band attenuation of HF probing radar\nwaves passing through the irregularities in the vicinity of the\nUH resonance altitude due to scattering, a process known as\nanomalous absorption [Stubbe et al., 1982; Jones et al., 1984;\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 112, A05314, doi:10.1029\/2006JA011938, 2007\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1Department of Communications Systems, Lancaster University,\nLancaster, UK.\n2Department of Physical Sciences, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland.\n3Department of Electrical Engineering, Interamerican University of\nPuerto Rico, Bayamo\u00b4n, Puerto Rico, USA.\n4Now at School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Southampton,\nSouthampton, UK.\nCopyright 2007 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/07\/2006JA011938$09.00\nA05314 1 of 11\nRobinson, 1989]. Besides TPI, UH or electron Bernstein (EB)\nwaves (electron electrostatic waves perpendicular to the\nfield lines) coupled to lower hybrid (LH) waves may also\nbe produced by parametric decay of the pump wave, i.e.,\nPDIUH\/EB: EM! UH\/EB + LH [Istomin and Leyser, 1995].\n[4] Langmuir and UH turbulence are both known to\ngenerate radio waves which can be detected on the ground\nas stimulated electromagnetic emissions (SEE). A number\nof processes have been suggested in the creation of these\nemissions, including scattering of the enhanced Langmuir or\nUH waves from natural or artificial plasma inhomogeneities,\nfor example, FAS, or damped ion acoustic waves and\nsubsequent conversion to EM waves [Thide\u00b4 et al., 1983;\nLeyser, 2001].\n[5] Electrons accelerated by HF pump-driven electrostatic\nturbulence can travel up and down the magnetic field lines\nand excite the neutrals by collisions, stimulating optical\nemissions identical to the natural aurorae. The dominant red\nand green line emissions at 630.0 and 557.7 nm from the\ntwo lowest excited states of atomic oxygen, O(1D) and\nO(1S), can be stimulated by electrons with excitation\nenergies more than 1.96 and 4.17 eV, respectively [Haslett\nand Megill, 1974; Bernhardt et al., 1991]. Intensities up to\n\u0001200 Rayleighs (R) for red line and \u000150 R for green line\nemission have been observed in high-latitude HF pumping\nexperiments [Pedersen et al., 2003]. It has been long known\nthat thermal electrons are responsible for some of the O(1D)\nemissions observed in past ionospheric pumping experi-\nments [Haslett and Megill, 1974; Mantas, 1994; Mantas\nand Carlson, 1996]. However, the red and green line\nemission intensities provide direct evidence that the ther-\nmally heated electrons do not have sufficient fluxes to\nproduce the observed intensities [Gustavsson et al., 2002;\nKosch et al., 2004; Ashrafi et al., 2006]. Therefore electrons\naccelerated by pump-driven electrostatic turbulence are a\nprimary contributor to the excitation of the red line emis-\nsion. The green line because of its higher threshold energy\ncan only be due to HF pump-driven accelerated electrons\n[Gustavsson et al., 2002]. However, the electron accelera-\ntion mechanism is still a subject of debate.\n[6] Electron acceleration by UH turbulence at high lati-\ntudes was first suggested by Leyser et al. [2000]. This\nhypothesis has been supported by other theoretical work\n[Istomin and Leyser, 2003] and experimental evidence\n[Kosch et al., 2002; Gustavsson et al., 2004] provided by\nmeans of pumping close to electron gyroharmonic frequen-\ncies. In a more recent study byGrach et al. [2004] at the Sura\nionospheric heating facility in Russia, the UH or EB waves\nare shown to be responsible for 557.7 nm airglow enhance-\nments. However, based on other theoretical considerations\nand previous experiments, it has been shown that Langmuir\nturbulence is also responsible for the accelerated electrons\ncausing artificial optical emissions [Gurevich et al., 1985;\nBernhardt et al., 1989; Kosch et al., 2004]. Gumerov et al.\n[1999] provided evidence of pump-induced 557.7 nm optical\nemissions in the first 5 ms of the pump-on cycle, which is\nmuch shorter than the growth time of the FAS (\u00011\u201310 s),\nwhich is clear evidence of electron acceleration by Langmuir\nturbulence due to parametric instabilities.\n[7] The coexistence of the thermal (TPI) and parametric\n(PDIUH\/EB) instabilities has been suggested by [Mishin et al.,\n2005b], in which both UH and Langmuir turbulence are\nthought to contribute to the production of the airglow. It has\nbeen established that the generationmechanism for Langmuir\nturbulence at angles close to the magnetic zenith is different\nfrom the PDIL process at the reflection altitude of the pump\nwave near the local geographic zenith [Mishin et al., 2005a].\nBy pumping at angles inside the Spitze cone (approximately\n6\u0001 zenith angle at the European Incoherent Scatter\n(EISCAT)), the pump waves reach the standard reflection\naltitude where the local plasma frequency equals the pump\nfrequency [Rietveld et al., 1993]. The Spitze angle is equal to\narcsin ([(Y \/ (1 + Y)]1 \/ 2 sinqB), where qB is the angle of the\ngeomagnetic field from vertical and Y= fce \/ f0, where fce is the\nelectron cyclotron frequency and f0 is the pump frequency.\nO-mode waves with incident angles outside the Spitze\nangle, for example, at magnetic zenith, reflect below the\nstandard reflection layer. Mishin et al. [2004] developed a\nnew scenario for the generation of Langmuir waves outside\nthe Spitze cone through the oscillating two-stream instability\nof UH waves in the magnetic zenith direction [Kuo et al.,\n1997]. An additional mechanism has been suggested in\nwhich electrons can also be accelerated by LH turbulence\nand produce optical emissions [Mishin et al., 2004].\n[8] In this paper, we present results from an ionospheric\nO-mode pumping experiment near the 4th electron gyro-\nharmonic at the EISCAT heating facility. This unique\nexperiment provided the first observational evidence that\naccelerated electrons through Langmuir turbulence produce\nthe artificial optical emissions at high latitudes [Kosch et al.,\n2004]. A unique feature is that only by pumping 9\u0001 south of\nlocal geographic zenith did an optical annular structure\nappear, collapsing into a blob in less than 60 s. Many\naspects of this experiment remain unexplained; for example,\nwhy the optical emissions form around the pump beam edge\nwhere the HF power is more than half reduced or why the\nannular structure only occurs for one specific pump beam\nzenith angle (9\u0001 south). In the following sections, we\ndescribe and analyze the spatial and temporal evolution of\nthe UHF radar backscatter, the optical emission height using\ntriangulation, and the SEE spectra including a deduction of\ntheir generation altitude based on their spectral shape.\n2. Stimulated Electromagnetic Emissions: The\nBroad Up-Shifted Maximum (UM)\n[9] The first observations of stimulated electromagnetic\nemissions (SEE) were reported in Troms\u00f8 by Thide\u00b4 et al.\n[1982] during ionospheric pump experiments. The stimu-\nlated emissions spectra, which cover about \u0003100 kHz to\n+200 kHz of bandwidth around the reflected HF pump wave\n[Frolov et al., 1998], with intensities up to a few tens of\ndecibels above the background noise level, can be detected\non the ground. Using the SEE spectra, it is possible to study\nthe ionospheric processes directly and without using addi-\ntional EM probing waves. Scattering of the excited plasma\nwaves off small-scale irregularities near the UH resonance\naltitude has been long considered as the main generation\nmechanism for the SEE [Grach, 1985]. There have been\nattempts to link different SEE spectral properties, and their\ntemporal evolution, to the development of various wave\ninteraction processes in the artificially perturbed ionosphere\n[Leyser, 2001 and references therein]. It is known that the\nSEE features and their timescales are associated with the\nA05314 ASHRAFI ET AL.: HF PUMP-INDUCED IONOSPHERIC PHENOMENA\n2 of 11\nA05314\nponderomotive force which acts during the first \u000110 ms and\nponderomotive\/thermal type processes which develop in\ntimescales of \u00011 s of pumping [Leyser, 2001].\n[10] Experimental observations have shown that most of\nthe SEE spectral characteristics depend on the pump\nfrequency ( f0) in relation to the F-region electron cyclotron\nfrequency ( fce) [Leyser et al., 1989, 1990; Stubbe et al., 1994;\nHonary et al., 1999; Cheung et al., 1998] and\/or F-region\ncritical frequency [Leyser et al., 1990; Armstrong et al.,\n1990]. The first classification of the SEE spectral features\nwas performed by Stubbe et al. [1984] who categorized them\neither as \u2018\u2018gyrofeatures\u2019\u2019 which exist only at f0 \u0004 nfce, where\nelectron gyroharmonic number n = 3 or greater, such as the\nup-shifted maximum (UM), or universal features, which exist\nat all frequencies except for pumping close to a gyro-\nharmonic, for example, the down-shifted maximum (DM).\n[11] The most prominent gyrofeature of the up-shifted\nSEE spectra is the broad up-shifted maximum (BUM),\nwhich is strongly dependent on the pump frequency. The\nBUM is known to occur at pump frequencies close to and\nslightly above the electron gyroharmonics, and it normally\nappears in the SEE spectra just above the pump frequency\n[Leyser et al., 1990; Stubbe et al., 1994]. The BUM peak\nfrequency obeys the following empirical relation, fBUM =\n2f0 \u0003 nfce, in which fBUM is the frequency of the BUM\npeak intensity [Leyser et al., 1989]. When pumping near an\nelectron gyroharmonic, due to the strong cyclotron damping\nof the waves traveling perpendicular to the magnetic field\nline, the BUM and DM structures cease to exist. For f0 > nfce,\nEB andUHwaves can be enhanced and lead to the generation\nof the BUM features for frequencies near the electron\ngyrofrequency [Leyser et al., 1989].\n[12] Previous experiments have demonstrated that anoma-\nlous absorption of HF probing waves, and therefore FAS, is\nsuppressed near the electron gyroharmonics [Robinson,\n1989]. Some SEE features such as the down-shifted maxi-\nmum (DM) and broad continuum (BC) are also suppressed at\nthe same range of frequencies [Stubbe et al., 1994]. In\naddition, the BUM risetime is similar to some of the other\nfeatures of the SEE, such as the DM, and is consistent with\nthe growth time of the FAS [Leyser et al., 1990; Frolov et al.,\n1996]. Therefore FAS play a major role in the generation of\nsuch emissions. The DM feature of the SEE suppresses only\nin a narrow range of frequencies in the vicinity of the electron\ncyclotron frequency where the FAS are suppressed. How-\never, features such as the BUM demonstrate a rather more\ncomplex behavior [Frolov et al., 1996]. The BUM starts to\nappear at pump frequencies \u000110 kHz below the gyrohar-\nmonic frequency (for n = 5) [Frolov et al., 1996], it maxi-\nmizes around 30\u201340 kHz above the electron gyroharmonic\n[Leyser, 2001], and continues to exist to a maximum pump\nfrequency of \u0001100 kHz above the gyrofrequency [Thide\u00b4\net al., 1983; Stubbe et al., 1994]. During this frequency\ninterval, the FAS are suppressed only in a very narrow range\nof frequencies, and despite further development of the FAS\nfor frequencies above this range, the BUM structure ceases to\nexist for higher pump frequencies. Therefore the importance\nof the FAS in the generation mechanism of the BUM\nemission is not entirely clear [Wagner et al., 1999].\n[13] There have been attempts to provide theoretical\nmodels to describe the properties of the BUM spectra in\nthe past [Leyser, 2001, and references therein]. However,\nnone of the theoretical explanations has been able to\ndescribe all of the observational properties of this pheno-\nmenon [Frolov et al., 1998]. Various four-wave generation\nmechanisms have been frequently suggested in the literature\ndue to the up-shifted characteristic of the BUM. These\nexplanations mostly involve EB and UH waves both of\nwhich are generated by thermal instabilities near the UH\nresonance altitude.\n3. Radar Backscatter\n[14] Artificial field-aligned irregularities are a common\nfeature of HF O-mode pumping, resulting from mode\nconversion of the EM pump waves into electrostatic waves\nat the UH resonance altitude [Robinson, 1989], a few\nkilometers below the HF reflection altitude. Bragg scattering\nof the HF sounding waves from preexisting natural or\nartificially stimulated irregularities with a scale size of half\nthe radar wavelength produces the HF coherent backscatter\nthat is used as a proxy for detecting the excited UH waves\n[Stubbe, 1996].\n[15] By pumping the ionosphere close to the third or\nhigher electron gyroharmonic frequencies, the growth of\nUH waves and FAS is suppressed. This allows most of the\npump energy to reach the HF reflection height where\nLangmuir turbulence-related processes dominate the elec-\ntron heating [Honary et al., 1999]. This phenomenon is\ncommonly observed as persistent ion line enhancements in\nthe incoherent scatter radar spectra occurring just below the\npump wave reflection altitude. It has been attributed to\nLangmuir processes in which the pump wave, as a result of\nparametric instabilities, couples to a high-frequency plasma\nwave and a low frequency IA wave [Bernhardt et al., 1989;\nStubbe et al., 1992; Djuth et al., 1994; Kosch et al., 2004].\nThe persistent enhancements are only visible at zenith\nangles close to the direction of the magnetic field line\n[Isham et al., 1999b; Kosch et al., 2004, Figure 3].\n[16] Since the threshold for the parametric decay insta-\nbility is easily exceeded, the enhanced Langmuir waves can\nbecome pump waves themselves and excite secondary\nparametric instabilities [Rietveld et al., 1993]. As a result,\na Langmuir wave can further decay into an IA wave and\nanother Langmuir wave with a lower frequency. This\ncascading process continues as long as the threshold for\nexcitation of the instability is met. Langmuir waves cascade\nin frequency and broaden the plasma and ion line radar\nfrequency spectrum [Kohl et al., 1993]. The cascade lines of\nthe up- and down-propagating plasma waves can only be\nexcited at different altitudes where their frequency matches\nthe local plasma mode. The IA waves connected to cascade\nprocesses are detected at the altitudes where ion waves\nproduce nonlinear Landau damping cascades. These echoes\ncontribute to the backscatter ion line enhancements in the\nvicinity of the O-mode reflection altitude [Djuth et al.,\n1994]. A radar with sufficient range resolution should detect\n(1) the primary ion and plasma line and (2) the cascade ion\nand plasma lines. Nevertheless, if the resolution of the radar\nis comparable to the separation of the excitation altitudes,\nonly one ion line enhancement will be observable [Stubbe et\nal., 1992]. This is the case for the data analyzed here. The\nEISCAT UHF radar data have a range resolution of \u00015.4 km\nwhich is similar to the estimated difference in height between\nA05314 ASHRAFI ET AL.: HF PUMP-INDUCED IONOSPHERIC PHENOMENA\n3 of 11\nA05314\nthe primary and cascade ion lines using equations (11) and\n(12) in the work by Stubbe et al. [1992] (\u00013 km). Therefore\nthe radar range resolution is not sufficient to resolve the two\ndifferent signatures.\n4. Experiment Description\n[17] On 12 November 2001, the EISCAT heating facility\n[Stubbe, 1996] was transmitting O-mode waves at 5.423 MHz\noperating at 550 MW effective radiative power (ERP) with a\n2-min on, 2-min off cycle with the pump beam pointed\n9\u0001 south of vertical in the first half of the experiment (15:08\u2013\n16:55 UT). During the second half (16:57\u201320:00 UT), the\npump beam was scanning between 3\u0001 north and 15\u0001 south of\nvertical in 3\u0001 steps with a 2-min on, 1-min off pump cycle.\nThe pump beam width is \u00017\u0001 throughout and magnetic\nzenith is 12.8\u0001 south of vertical. The pump frequency corre-\nsponds to the fourth electron gyroharmonic at 215 km, which\nis close to the HF interaction altitude during the experiment.\n[18] Optical observations were made simultaneously from\ntwo stations \u000152 km apart. The Digital All-Sky Imager\n(DASI) camera [Kosch et al., 1998] with a 50\u0001 field of view\nwas located remotely at Skibotn, Norway (69.35\u0001N and\n20.36\u0001E), pointing vertically using narrow-band interference\nfilters at 630.0 nm for 15:08\u201316:21 UT as well as 18:13\u2013\n20:25 UT and 557.7 nm for 16:24\u201318:09 UT. The other\ncamera situated at Ramfjordmoen (69.59\u0001N and 19.23\u0001E)\ncolocated with EISCAT and was looking along the magnetic\nfield line direction with a \u000140\u0001 field of view, recording in\nwhite light. The DASI used an integration time of 5 s for\n557.7 nm and 10 s for 630.0 nm, whereas the Ramfjordmoen\ncamera used a 13-s cycle with a 3-s integration.\n[19] Simultaneous ion line observations using the EISCAT\nUHF radar [Rishbeth and van Eyken, 1993] were performed\nwith the radar beam sweeping in 3\u0001 steps, moving from 3\u0001S to\n15\u0001S of the local geographic zenith in a north-south meridian\nscan from 15:08 to 16:55 UT. Between 16:57 and 20:00 UT,\nthe UHF radar was pointing 13\u0001S of vertical. The radar\nsignature of the optical ring and its descent in altitude were\nobserved in the EISCAT UHF backscatter power enhance-\nments near the reflection altitude [Kosch et al., 2004]. Similar\npump-induced descending radar signatures (not rings) have\nbeen observed by Djuth et al. [1994] as well as Dhillon and\nRobinson [2005]. For details of the optical and radar obser-\nvations, refer to the work of Kosch et al. [2004].\n[20] The SuperDualAuroral Radar Network (SuperDARN)\nCo-operativeUKTwinAuroral Sounding System (CUTLASS)\nHankasalmi coherent scatter radar was operating for an unre-\nlated experiment. Although data are available for the period of\nour experiment, the time and range resolution over EISCAT is\npoor (range resolution of 45 km, integration time of 7 s with a\n2-min beam scan time), giving a single measurement 70 s\nafter pump-on only.\n[21] SEE recordings were also made for the entire period of\nthe experiment. The data recordings have been performed\nwith a 14-s integration time and 300-Hz frequency resolution\ncovering \u0003100 to +200 kHz around the pump frequency.\n5. Observations and Data Analysis\n[22] The optical signature produced by the pump was a\nring-shaped structure at the start of the pump-on period\nwhich collapsed into a blob after \u000160 s of pumping [Kosch\net al., 2004]. Figure 1 shows the 10 s integrated optical\nemissions recorded by the DASI at 557.7 nm for the Heater\ncycle starting at 16:25 UT (top panel) and 17:24 UT\n(bottom panel). Artificial optical annuli, which were centered\non the pump beam, formed a cylinder of optical emission,\nparallel to the magnetic field line direction. Intensities up to\n\u0001100 R (50 R) for the ring and \u0001300 R (100 R) for the\nblob structure artificial aurora were observed in 630.0 nm\n(557.7 nm).\n[23] The optical artificial aurora forms a ring structure\njust outside the pump wave \u00033 dB contour and collapses\ninto a blob along the magnetic field line. Investigating the\nstructure of the optical emissions reveals that, at the start of\neach pumping cycle, the optical signature may take a variety\nof forms throughout the experiment. In the first part of the\nexperiment, the annuli form an obvious ring which is mostly\nbrighter at angles closer to the vertical and inside the\nSpitze angle (Figure 1, top panel) before collapsing into a\nblob in the magnetic zenith. Later on in the experiment (after\n17:24 UT), the optical emission forms a blob in the magnetic\nzenith with a bright crescent outside the Spitze cone, which\ncollapses into a blob only in the magnetic zenith (Figure 1,\nbottom panel). The reason for the formation of the annuli\nstructure, which appears where the gradient of the pump\nwaves\u2019 intensity is the highest, is not known. From 17:45 UT\nonwards, when the reflection height increases abruptly, the\noptical structure forms only as a blob and not as a ring. There\nare few cases after 17:45 UT in which the optical emissions\nare present despite the pump frequency being above f0F2.\nPedersen et al. [2003] and Kosch et al. [2005] have provided\nexperimental evidence that the brightest optical emissions\noccur for pump frequencies close to the F-layer critical\nfrequency with an emission cutoff at about 0.5 MHz above\nf0F2.\n[24] Multistation observations of auroral emissions and the\napplication of height triangulation in estimating the location\nof the emission are well-known, long-standing techniques\n[Sto\u00a8rmer, 1955]. In the case of artificial ionospheric modifi-\ncation, altitude estimation of the pump-induced optical emis-\nsions has been performed in the past using tomography\n[Gustavsson et al., 2001], height triangulation [Haslett and\nMegill, 1974], and parallax [Kosch et al., 2004].\n[25] On 12 November 2001, the optical recordings of the\nartificial optical emissions were performed from two stations\nlocated at Skibotn and Ramfjordmoen with about 52 km\nseparation. The green and red line data from the DASI camera\ntogether with the white light recordings of the Ramfjordmoen\ncamera have been used to estimate the height of the emis-\nsions. We assume that the vertical extent of the artificial\naurora is limited, or equivalently, the height triangulation\nfocuses on the region of greatest intensity, i.e., near the\nbottom of the forms due to increasing O density with\ndecreasing altitude. The O(1S) 557.7 nm emission is suitable\nfor studying temporal variations, due to its short radiative\nlifetime (\u00010.7 s), compared with the brighter O(1D) 630.0 nm\nemission with \u000130 s effective lifetime in the F-layer\n[Gustavsson et al., 2001]. Therefore for the first half of\nthe experiment (until 16:21 UT) when the Skibotn camera\nwas recording the red line emission, only the height of the\noptical emission just before the pump-off period has been\ncalculated, when the steady state is most likely. For the\nA05314 ASHRAFI ET AL.: HF PUMP-INDUCED IONOSPHERIC PHENOMENA\n4 of 11\nA05314\nsecond half of the experiment, when the Skibotn camera\nrecorded with the 557.7 nm filter, height triangulation was\nperformed every 20 s, synchronized to the pump-on cycle.\n[26] In order to correct the lens distortion for both\ncameras and calculate each camera\u2019s exact position and\npointing direction, star field images, computed from a star\ncatalog and mapped onto the data images, have been used\n[Duffet-Smith, 1990]. Second-order corrections have been\nmade to the image x and y directions in order to compensate\nfor the lens distortion-induced discrepancies between the\nrecorded images and the star map, which is typical of night\nvision imaging systems. The same corrections have to be\nmade to all the images from both cameras [Ashrafi et al.,\n2005].\n[27] In order to eliminate the effect of the unwanted\nbackground signal, which also includes numerous stars in\nthe case of the Ramfjordmoen camera recording in white\nlight, background subtraction and filtering have been applied.\nA clear picture of only the artificial emissions is obtained by\nsubtracting the average of five successive images of the\npreceding pump-off cycles from any image during the\npump-on cycle of interest. In addition, a 5 \u0005 5 median filter\nhas been applied to the images to eliminate the background\nnoise and residual stars due to their motion. The Skibotn and\nRamfjord images have been synchronized because the inte-\ngration and cycle time of the cameras are different. The\ndifference in time between the real camera image and the\nrequired synchronized image is only a few seconds; therefore\nlinear interpolation is a good approximation for producing\nthe desired image. This method has been applied to the\nRamfjord camera images in order to synchronize them with\nthe DASI data.\n[28] For the height triangulation, the synchronized images\nare transformed into a common coordinate system. Geo-\ngraphic coordinates are well suited to this purpose. First,\nthe image is converted into altitude and azimuth angles in\nFigure 1. Series of the DASI camera images showing the development of the pump-induced optical\nemissions at 557.7 nm with a 5-s integration after background subtraction and filtering. The circles mark\nthe \u00033 dB pump beam projected at 230 km altitude and tilted 9\u0001 south of the local geographic zenith at\nRamfjordmoen. The upper cross indicates the location of the HF transmitter and the lower cross shows\nthe magnetic field line direction at Ramfjordmoen projected at 230 km altitude. Top panel, the Heater\nturns on at 16:25 UT and turns off at 16:27 UT. Bottom panel, the Heater turns on at 17:24 UT and turns\noff at 17:26 UT.\nA05314 ASHRAFI ET AL.: HF PUMP-INDUCED IONOSPHERIC PHENOMENA\n5 of 11\nA05314\nhorizon coordinates [Duffet-Smith, 1990]. Then, by choosing\na certain height, the image is transformed into geographic\ncoordinates. Finally, the linear two-dimensional correlation\ncoefficient between the corresponding images in the geo-\ngraphic coordinates from the different platforms has been\ncalculated within a common geographic area between 17.3\u0001\nand 20.2\u0001E longitude and 68.6\u0001 and 69.6\u0001N latitude. The\ncorrelation coefficient has been calculated for a range of\nheights in the vicinity of the pump wave reflection altitude\ninferred from ionosonde data. The height where the cross-\ncorrelation maximizes is the most likely altitude of the peak\noptical volume emission rate. This technique has the advan-\ntage that no common edge or boundary needs to be identified,\nand the entire diffuse structure contributes to the height\ntriangulation result, greatly reducing the uncertainty.\n[29] The correlation coefficient versus height has been\ncalculated for each 2-km altitude step. By fitting a curve to\nthe altitude versus cross-correlation points, the maximum\ncross-correlation achieved for any given time has been\ndetermined [Ashrafi et al., 2005]. This gives the true equi-\nvalent height of the origin of the optical emissions, assuming\nzero vertical extent. In the ideal case, the cross-correlation for\nthis altitude should be close to unity but considering the\nmeasurement uncertainty, lens distortion corrections, time\nsynchronization, noise, and other factors involved (such as\nvertical extent), this is not generally achievable. Another\nsource of altitude triangulation uncertainty derives from one\ncamera being monochromatic while the other was panchro-\nmatic. The typical range of values for the maximum cross-\ncorrelation is\u00010.6\u20130.8. The error associated with the height\nestimate is generated by uncertainties in the cross-correlation\nand is expressed as the standard deviation of the correlation\ncoefficient for each selected altitude. The height estimate\nuncertainty is \u00014\u20135 km on average. For details of the\nheight triangulation technique refer to the work by Ashrafi\net al. [2005], http:\/\/www.dcs.lancs.ac.uk\/iono\/publications\/\n31am_proceedings.pdf. The results are shown and discussed\nbelow.\n[30] Using the apparent increased horizontal extension of\nthe optical signature in the DASI images compared to the\nRamfjordmoen images, it is possible to estimate the vertical\nextent of the emission column by mapping the magnetic\nfield line onto the images in geographic coordinates because\nthe Ramfjordmoen camera is colocated with the EISCAT\nHeater whereas the DASI is 52 km away. Therefore these\nlatter images have parallax; for example, at 16:25:10 and\n18:03:20 UT, the field-aligned extension of the 557.7 nm\nartificial aurora to first order is about 70 and 100 km,\nrespectively, which is consistent with that by Kosch et al.\n[2004].\n[31] In this study, the BUM spectra have been used to\nestimate the generation altitude of the SEE. The electron\ngyroharmonic frequency changes according to the geomag-\nnetic field strength with height. In addition, because of the\nchanges in the interaction altitude of the pump wave due to\npump-induced electron density variations [Ashrafi et al.,\n2006], the BUM emission generation altitude varies accord-\ningly. Therefore by calculating the electron cyclotron fre-\nquency from the International Geomagnetic Reference Field\n(IGRF) (1945\u20132010) magnetic field model, the generation\naltitude for the BUM emission has been estimated using the\nfollowing equation: fBUM = 2f0\u0003 nfce. The electron cyclotron\nfrequency is given by fce = eB \/ (2pm). In other words,\nseparation of the peak of the BUM spectra from the Heater\nfrequency is an indication of how far the Heater frequency is\nfrom the electron gyrofrequency at each altitude. Figure 2\nshows the SEE spectra during a pumping cycle starting at\n16:17 UT with a 14-s integration. SEE spectra from six\nsequential frequency sweeps of the spectrum analyzer are\nshown. A power offset of 10 dB has been added to each\nspectrum for presentation purposes. The broken lines indicate\nthe filtered BUM spectra which have been used to estimate\nFigure 2.

The heavy solid line joins the peak of the\nBUM spectra during the pumping cycle. The BUM peak\nfrequency approaches the pump frequency which indicates\ndescent of the SEE generation altitude.\n[32] Combining all the processed observations, Figure 3\nshows the optical height triangulation results (black crosses\/\nasterisks) and height estimate of the SEE generation region\n(blue asterisks) plotted on top of the EISCAT UHF radar\nbackscatter power for more than 40 consecutive HF pump\ncycles. The intervals indicated by black lines show the\npump-on periods. The upper labels mark the radar zenith\nangles south of vertical. The lower labels mark the pump\nbeam zenith angles south of vertical (negative angles\nindicate north of vertical). The reflection height of the pump\nwave has been calculated using the ionosonde (coherent HF\nvertical backscatter radar) data. The UH resonance altitude,\nindicated by the dashed line, has been produced according\nto fuh\n2 = fpe\n2 + fce\n2 [e.g., Dysthe et al., 1982] where fuh is the\nUH resonance frequency and fpe is the local cold plasma\nfrequency. For some of the pump cycles, there is no clear\nand consistent BUM structure throughout the pumping\nperiod, which is the reason why some of the SEE altitude\nestimates are missing.\n[33] The height of the radar ion line enhancements\nindicates the region where the electrostatic Langmuir waves\nare excited as the result of plasma turbulence processes. The\nheight determined from the SEE spectra occurs where the\nexcited electrostatic waves scatter off the existing plasma\nirregularities and stimulate electromagnetic waves in the\nsidebands of the pump wave, which then can be detected on\nthe ground. The optical emission height is the altitude at\nwhich accelerated electrons excite the ambient neutrals and\nproduce the photons.\n[34] The change in height of the brightest part of the\noptical emission has been calculated for the time period\nbetween 15:42 and 18:09 UT, as described earlier. Height\nestimates of the quasi-steady-state red line emission are\nshown for the first part of the experiment (15:42\u201316:21 UT)\nwith black crosses. The second part of the experiment\n(16:25\u201318:09 UT) shows the estimated altitudes for the\ngreen line emission data (black asterisks). The quasi-steady-\nstate location of the red line emission is consistently higher\nthan the green line estimated altitude. This is most likely\ndue to the long lifetime of the red line emission and descent\nof the interaction region, which never reaches a steady state\nfor a full 30 s; that is, the effective height of the emission is\nthe true height of the steady state blob but from \u000130 s prior\nto the measurements.\n[35] The descent in altitude of the ion line data, shown in\nFigure 3, is a result of the descent of the pump waves\u2019\nresonance region where the plasma frequency equals the\npump frequency. The pump wave resonance altitude is\nsimply related to the matching height [Stubbe et al., 1992].\nPumping the lower F-layer plasma causes an increase in\nelectron temperature [Stocker et al., 1992; Rietveld et al.,\n2003] and decrease in electron recombination rate [Gurevich,\n1978], thereby increasing the plasma density. Electron\ndensity increases near the reflection point of the radio waves,\nresulting in the descent of the reflection level of the pump\nwave [Ashrafi et al., 2006]. The general descent in height of\nthe optical signature is consistent with the height variations of\nthe EISCAT backscatter enhancements and changes in the\nSEE generation altitude.\n[36] The SEE generation altitude is always below the UH\naltitude and below the ion line enhancements height. The\naltitude of the optical emission is mostly above the SEE\ngeneration height throughout the experiment. For the first\nhalf of the experiment (until 17:24 UT), the optical emis-\nsions appear below the reflection height and UH resonance\naltitude. After \u000117:24 UT, with decreasing f0F2, the height\nof the optical signature starts to increase and appears to be\nsometimes above the reflection altitude. After \u000117:40 UT,\nthe weakening of the ionosphere leads to the ascent of the\nreflection altitude of the pump waves. In this period, the\naltitude of SEE formation increases and the optical emission\nproduction height also increases. Although this effect can be\ndue to an increase in altitude of the electron acceleration\nregion, the increasing vertical extent of the optical structure\nabove the acceleration region also causes the estimated\nheight of the optical emission column to increase.\n[37] CUTLASS clearly shows weak enhancements\n(\u000120 dB) in the backscatter power over the EISCAT HF\nbeam (not shown), which is evidence of the existence of FAS\nin the vicinity of the UH resonance altitude. Typical back-\nscatter power due to O-mode pumping can be 30 dB or more.\nIn this case, although CUTLASS only makes a single\nobservation 70 s into each pump cycle, the FAS will be fully\ndeveloped at that time.\n6. Discussion\n[38] The aim of this study is to understand the electron\nacceleration mechanism involved in the production of the\nartificial optical emissions. Normally, when pumping near\nthe electron gyrofrequency, the optical emissions are sup-\npressed [Leyser et al., 2000; Kosch et al., 2002]. However,\nthe November 2001 experiment is an exception, as the\nenhancements in the optical emission and the novel annuli\nstructure were observed for the first time by pumping close\nto and slightly above the fourth electron gyroharmonic\nfrequency. Other recent experiments at the HAARP facility\nin Alaska have also provided evidence that the optical\nemission maximizes at frequencies just above the electron\ngyroharmonics [Kosch et al., 2005; Gustavsson et al.,\n2006], which has been predicted in theory [Grach, 1979;\nDas and Fejer, 1979]. It is believed that both PDIUH\/EB- and\nTPI-related processes coexist and contribute to electron\nacceleration at frequencies close to and slightly above the\ngyroharmonic [Mishin et al., 2005b].\n[39] The incoherent scatter ion line enhancements persist\nthroughout the pump cycle only in the magnetic field-aligned\nand 9\u0001S radar positions. However, short-lived ion line\nenhancements (\u000110\u201315 s) have been detected at 6\u0001 and\n15\u0001S radar zenith angles. These are the data that have been\ninterpreted as evidence of a ring structure, detected by the\nradar during the first minute of pumping [Kosch et al., 2004].\nSimilar short-lived effects are detected after 16:57 UT with\nthe radar pointing along the field line and the HF\nbeam scanning from 3\u0001 north to 15\u0001 south of the zenith in\n3\u0001 steps. Strong backscatter enhancements are visible for HF\nbeam zenith angles of 9\u0001 and 12\u0001 S of vertical.\nA05314 ASHRAFI ET AL.: HF PUMP-INDUCED IONOSPHERIC PHENOMENA\n8 of 11\nA05314\n[40] At gyroharmonic frequencies, HF radar backscatter\npower [Honary et al., 1999], anomalous absorption [Stocker\net al., 1993; Stubbe et al., 1994], electron temperature\nenhancements [Honary et al., 1995; Robinson et al.,\n1996], and optical emissions [Kosch et al., 2002] minimize.\nThe phenomena are all related to the suppression of FAS at\nfrequencies close to the third or higher electron gyrohar-\nmonics. This suppression results in the reduced ability of\nFAS to trap the UH electrostatic waves near the electron\ngyrofrequencies [Mj\u00f8lhus, 1993]. Therefore it is consistent\nwith our special case where enhancements in the artificial\noptical emission with the presence of persistent ion line\nenhancements suggest that Langmuir turbulence-related\nprocesses are the main acceleration mechanism for the\nelectrons [Kosch et al., 2004]. However, existence of the\nweak FAS in the CUTLASS backscatter is an indication that\nthe UH waves are also present throughout the pumping\nperiod, in agreement with the mechanism described by\nMishin et al. [2005a], which allows for the scattering of\npump waves into Langmuir waves in the presence of UH\nwaves, or equivalently FAS, for zenith angles greater than\nthe Spitze angle (\u00016\u0001 at EISCAT). The ion line enhance-\nments observed in the EISCAT UHF radar are most prob-\nably due to this mechanism, as they are not observed at\nzenith angles smaller (closer to vertical) than the Spitze\nangle.\n[41] The BUM \u00033 dB spectral width can be used to\ncalculate the altitude range where the integrated SEE\nemissions come from using the following equation: fC =\n\u0003fBUM \/ n, where n is the number of the harmonic [Leyser\net al., 1990]. In our case, the spectral width of the BUM at\n\u00033 dB is\u000115\u201330 kHz which corresponds to a 3.75\u20137.5 kHz\nchange in the electron cyclotron frequency and is equivalent\nto a \u00018\u201312 km altitude range near the UH resonance height\n(\u0001220\u2013240 km). Later in the experiment, after 17:30 UT\nwhen the reflection height and the SEE generation altitude are\nascending as the ionosphere decays, the spectral width of the\nBUM increases to 35\u201345 kHz; hence, the vertical extent of\nthe BUM generation region also increases to \u000115\u201320 km.\nThe estimated vertical extent is consistent with the BUM\nfeatures being linked to the existence of FAS in the vicinity of\nthe UH resonance altitude. The elongation of the FAS in the\nmagnetic field line direction has been estimated to be \u000110\u2013\n15 km [Jones et al., 1984; Kelley et al., 1995]. Using\nmultifrequency HF radar measurements, e-folding scale\nlengths of \u000120 km have been measured for the density\nperturbations near the UH resonance altitude [Senior et al.,\n2004]. It is important to point out that the generation region of\nthe SEE spectra is always below the UH altitude and below\nthe ion line enhancements region. From Figure 3, it is clear\nthat the BUM spectra emanate from the bottom part of the\nFAS below the UH resonance height. This phenomenon is\nprobably due to the scattering of the SEE waves from the\nupper reaches of the FAS which prevent these SEE waves\nfrom reaching the ground; that is, only the SEE generation\nregion from the bottom of the FAS is visible from the ground\nbecause the FAS themselves scatter EM waves; so any SEE\ngenerated above the UH resonance altitude is lost to anom-\nalous absorption.\n[42] It has been theorized that by pumping near the\ngyroresonances a small fraction of the energy of the pump\nwave changes the distribution function of the accelerated\nelectrons and causes the distribution to have a rather long\ntail through to high energies up to approximately 1 keV\n[Vas\u2019kov and Ivanov-Kholodniy, 1991]. Another theoretical\nstudy has also shown formation of an intense electron\ndistribution function tail at high energies as a result of the\nmodifying waves with frequencies close to harmonics of\nthe electron cyclotron frequency [Dimant et al., 1992]. The\nhigh pump ERP used, combined with pumping just above\nthe fourth gyroharmonic, most likely explains the unusually\nhigh optical intensities during the experiment, up to 300 R\nfor red line and 100 R for green line emissions.\n7. Conclusion\n[43] The experimental results of ionospheric pumping at a\nfrequency close to and above the fourth electron gyro-\nfrequency at Troms\u00f8 have been presented. Several pheno-\nmena were observed:\n[44] (1) Artificial optical annuli appeared for pumping at\n9\u0001S of local geographic zenith. The collapse of the ring into\na blob and descent in altitude onto the magnetic field line\ndirection was observed.\n[45] (2) Persistent descending ion line enhancements,\nconsistent with the optical data, were observed only in\ndirections close to the magnetic field line (9\u0001 and 12\u0001S of\nlocal geographic zenith).\n[46] (3) Short-lived (\u00015\u201310 s) ion line enhancements\nwere only observed at 6\u0001 and 15\u0001 south of vertical.\n[47] (4) The BUM feature was observed in the SEE\nspectra throughout the experiment and changes in a way\nconsistent with the optical and radar signatures\u2019 descent in\naltitude.\n[48] The altitudes of the artificial optical emission, the\nSEE generation region, and the incoherent backscatter\nenhancements in the radar data have been compared.\nSignificant results of this study include the following:\n[49] (1) For a steady state ionosphere, the spatial evolu-\ntion of the optical signature is consistent with the descent of\nthe SEE BUM spectra and ion line enhancements in the\nradar backscattered power. The altitude of the optical\nemission is mostly above the SEE generation altitude.\n[50] (2) The artificial optical aurora is extended vertically\nalong the magnetic field line above and below its maximum\nintensity region for a few tens of kilometers.\n[51] (3) The observed SEE BUM generation altitude is\nalways below that of the ion line enhancements and extends\nin altitude for less than \u000120 km, which is consistent with\nthe elongation of FAS.\n[52] Several different wave-plasma interaction processes\nresulting in electron acceleration are possible. Our observa-\ntions show the following:\n[53] (1) The CUTLASS backscatter enhancements are\nevidence of the existence of FAS and UH waves throughout\nthe experiment, consistent with the generation of the SEE\nBUM spectra, which result from the TPI mechanism.\n[54] (2) The EISCAT UHF backscatter enhancements are\nevidence of the existence of Langmuir turbulence.\n[55] (3) Both the Langmuir waves and UH resonance are\nlikely to contribute simultaneously to the acceleration of\nelectrons to produce the high-intensity optical emissions\nobserved.\nA05314 ASHRAFI ET AL.: HF PUMP-INDUCED IONOSPHERIC PHENOMENA\n9 of 11\nA05314\n[56] Many aspects of this experiment are not fully under-\nstood and require further study.\n[57] Acknowledgments.
