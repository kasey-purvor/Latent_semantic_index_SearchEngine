This is mostly due to its ability, for the first time, to provide instantaneous spatial views of structures in the sys- tem, to separate temporal and spatial variations, and to derive velocities and directions of moving structures. Ground-based data have an important complementary impact on Cluster-related research, as they provide a larger-scale context to put the spacecraft data in, allow to virtually enlarge the spacecrafts\u2019 field of view, and make it possible to study in detail the coupling between the magnetosphere and the ionosphere in a spatially extended domain. With this paper we present an interim review of cooperative research done with Cluster and ground-based instruments, including the support of other space-based data. We first give a short overview of the instrumentation used, and present some specific data analysis and modeling techniques that have been devised for the combined analysis of Cluster and ground-based data.

To zeroth order\nit is a consequence of the high solar wind conductivity, and\nits dimensions reflect a stress balance between the solar wind\ndynamic pressure and the magnetic pressure inside the cav-\nity. The magnetosphere is coupled to the solar wind across\nits outer boundary - the magnetopause - and to the Earth\u2019s\nupper atmosphere via the ionosphere and thermosphere. Key\nprocesses at work at the magnetopause are magnetic recon-\nnection, particle entry, and large- and small-scale waves that\narise at and around this boundary. Electric currents couple\nthe magnetosphere and ionosphere, and large-scale convec-\ntion within the magnetosphere drives ionospheric currents,\nand has significant effects on the motion of the neutral atmo-\nsphere at thermospheric altitudes.

The meridian of the Cluster orbit clocks through all local\ntimes of the year supporting dayside, flank, and nightside investiga-\ntions.\nthe large-scale currents and convection is extracted from the\nsolar wind. The dominant mechanism through which this en-\nergy is extracted is reconnection on the dayside and the mo-\ntion of flux tubes past the Earth that are magnetically coupled\nto the magnetosphere via \u201copen\u201d magnetic field lines. The\nmagnetospheric plasma is replenished by the direct entry of\nsolar wind plasma, and electrons and ions of ionospheric ori-\ngin.\nClosure of important unanswered questions in space\nphysics demands novel instruments and\/or missions that ex-\ntend our observational capabilities in ways tailored to those\nquestions. For example, ground-based remote sensing of\nelectric and magnetic fields, and imaging of the aurora from\nspace and the ground provide us a macro-scale or even some-\ntimes a global perspective of the ionospheric projection along\nmagnetic field lines of the magnetospheric electric fields and\nparticle populations. With these larger-scale or global mea-\nsurements we can separate temporal and spatial variations,\nbut only in this two-dimensional projection. Our ability to\nproject this information outwards to infer magnetospheric\nquantities and to track magnetospheric dynamics, suffers\nfrom limitations in our understanding of the magnetic field\ntopology, and poorly understood parallel and inductive elec-\ntric fields that can electrically decouple the magnetosphere\nand ionosphere. On the other hand, in-situ satellite obser-\nvations provide essential information about charged parti-\ncle distribution functions, electric and magnetic fields, and\na host of plasma waves, but typically do not provide simulta-\nneous observations in different magnetospheric regions nor\nthe ability to separate temporal variations from spatial gra-\ndients. The recognition of these limitations is the motiva-\ntion for the development of multi-satellite constellation-, and\ncluster-class missions, both of which represent bold advances\nthat will allow us to explore fundamentally new physics and\nbring closure to central questions in our field.\nIn a constellation-class mission, multiple similarly in-\nstrumented spacecraft will simultaneously probe different\ngeospace regions, with the scientific motivation of exploring\nthe physics of macroscale geospace processes, such as, sub-\nstorms, fast plasma flows, and flux transfer events. Cluster-\nclass missions, on the other hand, involve several similarly\ninstrumented spacecraft flying in close formation with the\nfollowing objectives:\n\u2013 To explore the physics of small-scale geospace struc-\ntures. An example is magnetic reconnection. Single\nsatellites, such as Polar and Geotail, have identified sig-\nnatures of reconnection, such as ion diffusion and fast\nflows on the dayside magnetopause and in the nightside\nmid-tail CPS (e.g. Bale et al., 2002). A close formation\nof appropriately instrumented satellites probe the struc-\nture of an X-line.\n\u2013 To measure gradients, curls, and field-line curvatures.\nThese quantities appear in terms in virtually all of the\nequations describing geospace phenomena. For exam-\nple, any studies of ballooning in the inner magneto-\nsphere require knowledge of field-line curvature and the\ngradients in the (non-isotropic) pressure.\n\u2013 To measure the source regions and propagation charac-\nteristics of waves and structures. For example, the Clus-\nter quartet can measure the characteristics of surface\nwaves, for example, Kelvin-Helmholtz waves, on the\nmagnetopause, as recently demonstrated by Hasegawa\net al. (2004).\n\u2013 To measure the orientation and motion of magneto-\nspheric boundaries. For example, Cluster observations\nof magnetopause motion have been used to characterize\nthe response of the dayside magnetopause to changes in\nthe solar wind parameters (Bosqued et al., 2001).\nThe first cluster-class mission is the appropriately named\nthe European Space Agency\u2019s Cluster-Mission, which was\nlaunched in summer 2000. The Cluster mission concept is\ndescribed in Escoubet et al. (1997, 2001). Cluster consists of\nfour identically instrumented satellites. The spacecraft sep-\naration, orbit, and instrumentation were selected to facilitate\nstudies of small-scale plasma processes in key geospace re-\ngions, such as the bow shock, magnetopause, magnetotail\nand auroral zone (see Figs. 1, 2a and b). The orbits of the four\nspacecraft are adjusted through subtle maneuvers in such a\nway that they form a tetrahedron at pre-specified locations\nnear apogee, for example, in and above the cusp, or in and\naround the magnetotail. Consequently, orbital dynamics lead\nto a \u201cstring-of-pearls\u201d configuration at and near perigee, for\nexample, in the interior cups and the auroral zones. The sep-\narations range from several hundred km up to several Earth\nradii. The orbit is polar, with 4RE perigee and 19.6RE\napogee both roughly in the magnetospheric equator. The or-\nbital plane rotates in local time over one year, so that six\nO. Amm et al.: Coordinated Cluster and ground-based studies 2131\nmonths after apogee is on the dayside, it is on the nightside\n(see Figs. 1, 2a and b). Each Cluster satellite carries the same\nset of eleven instruments that allow for the detection of elec-\ntron and ion distribution functions at spin resolution, and the\nmeasurement of electric and magnetic fields at higher time\nresolution, from DC to high frequencies. A brief description\nof the instrument complement is given in Sect. 2.1 below. Al-\nthough the instrument complement is truly state-of-the-art,\nand includes several novel instrument types, an even larger\nimpact of Cluster on the international space science commu-\nnity is derived from the fact that it is the first cluster-class\nmission.\nWell before the Cluster launch, it was widely recognized\nthat the mission\u2019s scientific impact could be greatly enhanced\nby a complementary ground-based program (see the proceed-\nings of the NATO 1991 Svalbard workshop). Three ma-\njor observational contributions that ground-based observa-\ntions can provide were highlighted by Opgenoorth and Lock-\nwood (1997):\n\u2013 Resolution of spatial and temporal variations in dy-\nnamic events, such as the expansive phase of substorms.\n\u2013 Placing satellite observations in context. Ground-based\nobservations are widely used, for example, for the iden-\ntification of convection and auroral boundaries and the\ncross polar cap potential, and their spatial and temporal\ndynamics.\n\u2013 The provision of ionospheric boundary conditions, such\nas conductivities which are important for Alfve\u00b4n wave\nreflection and magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling dur-\ning substorms, and within active dayside reconnection\nevents and low altitude cusp processes.\nIn these ways, science, motivated by the satellite measure-\nments, would be enhanced through the context that ground-\nbased and other remote sensing of the ionosphere provide.\nIn turn, Cluster observations enhance ground-based obser-\nvations in important ways, several of which we list here:\nCluster can measure boundary motions. Repeated magne-\ntopause crossings, for example, could signify surface waves\nthat can be related to poleward moving auroral forms or mag-\nnetic pulsations. Starting from the Cluster observations such\nfeatures can be identified in otherwise hard to interpret global\nnetwork ground-based data. Cluster can confirm, for exam-\nple, the existence of an X-line in the plasma sheet during a\nsubstorm, and point the way to new ground-based observa-\ntions related to such features. Alternatively, confirmation by\nCluster that reconnection is occurring on the dayside magne-\ntopause at the same time that it is occurring as specific cusp\nprecipitation is an essential step in the development of proxy\nsignatures for such processes that can later be used in statis-\ntical studies.\nIn the \u201cstring-of-pearls\u201d configuration, Cluster can provide\nin-situ observations that can relate, for example, changing\nphysical conditions in the auroral zone to observed changes\nin the auroral distribution.\n \n \n \n \n \nA\nSolar Wind\nMa\ngne\ntos\nhea\nth\nCentral Plasma Sheet\n(Polar Cap) Boundary\nOpen-Closed Field-Line\nNeutral Sheet\nMagnetopause\n \n \n \n \n \nB\nFig. 2. (a) The orbit of Cluster was selected to maximize the op-\nportunities to study cusp, magnetosheath, and bow shock processes\nduring periods of dayside apogee. (b) Nightside apogee takes Clus-\nter through the CPS in the mid-tail reconnection region, ideally\nsuited for studies of substorms, and thin current sheets.\nClose coordination between the two research communities\nprovides synergy, and opens the door to research not previ-\nously possible. For example, coordinated Cluster ground-\nbased observations have made possible the first real cross-\nscale coupling studies. Cluster can provide, for example, in-\nsitu observations of the micro-physics of reconnection on the\ndayside magnetopause. The simultaneous global view pro-\nvided by ground-based observations allows us then to explore\nhow and through what other mechanisms such small-scale\nprocesses couple to larger scale dynamics, as seen in global\nconvection, current and precipitation patterns. Such studies\nare impossible without both the ground-based and Cluster-\ntype data.\n2132 O. Amm et al.: Coordinated Cluster and ground-based studies\nTo give a structure to the Cluster ground-based program,\nand to coordinate the work of the rather large and previ-\nously quite disparate international ground-based observation\ncommunity, the Cluster Ground-based Working Group was\nformed in 1991 as a formal coordinating body. The initial\nchair of this group, H. Opgenoorth, was recognized by ESA\nwith a membership in the Cluster Science Working Team\n(SWT), giving the ground-based program the status of an in-\nstrument on the spacecraft (the SWT is made up of the 11\ninstrument PIs, and the ground-based coordinator).\nThe initial prescription for action by the Working Group\nwas straightforward: it was to identify ground-based assets,\ndevelop protocols for data archiving and summary presenta-\ntion via the World Wide Web that would facilitate the use of\nground-based data in conjunction with Cluster data, and de-\nvelop tools for identifying useful ground-based Cluster con-\njunctions (see, e.g. Opgenoorth and Lockwood, 1997). This\nlargely technical work was successful, and has led to sig-\nnificant advances in data formats and the integrated use of\ndata from different instrument arrays and types, and it has\nalso significantly improved coordination between different\nground-based programs (see Lockwood et al., 1997).\nIn order to ensure that ground-based observations will do\nmore than simply provide context for the satellite measure-\nments, the Working Group adopted a strategy of identify-\ning Cluster related science that not only required the use of\nground-based coordinated measurements, but was driven by\nthe ground-based research itself. It also defined a broadened\nmandate by extending its efforts to include global MHD and\nempirical modelling to more meaningfully connect ground\nand in-situ observations. Further, the Working Group recog-\nnized that global imaging of the aurora from space, geosyn-\nchronous particle and magnetic field observations, and parti-\ncle observations from low altitude satellites like DMSP and\nFAST all provide data that are utilized in ways analogous to\nground-based remote sensing data. Note therefore, that for\nsuch purposes, space-based global imaging, geosynchronous\nparticle and field, and low-altitude particle observations have\nbeen included under the overall heading of \u201cground-based\u201d\ndata. The common characteristic of these types of data is\nthat they provide ionospheric observations with essentially\nno uncertainty in terms of localization.\nThe overall theme became rather \u201cspecification of the\nionospheric electrodynamics and precipitation distribution\u201d,\nas compared to simply \u201cobservations made from the ground\u201d.\nIn the end, the Working Group has brought together a\nblend of global modelling, global ground-based, and geosyn-\nchronous and low-altitude satellite observations capable of\nalmost complete specification of the electrodynamics, con-\nvection, and precipitation in the ionosphere on a global scale\nfor hours at a time.\nIn this paper we review scientific results derived from the\ncoordinated use of Cluster and ground-based data. While\nthis effort grew out of the Cluster Ground-Based Working\nGroup, we have not restricted our attention to research by\nthat group. The team surveyed published work that used\nboth ground-based and Cluster data and tried to identify sci-\nentific highlights to be included in this review. In Sect. 2\nwe briefly describe the relevant ground-based and Cluster in-\nstruments, pointing the reader to key recent references, and\noutline value-added data analysis, empirical models, data as-\nsimilation, and global models, all of which are relevant to co-\nordinated Cluster ground-based work. The Cluster ground-\nbased work that we review falls into three categories. In\nSects. 3 and 4 we review dayside (i.e. cusp processes, FTEs,\nand magnetic reconnection) and nightside (i.e. substorms,\nfast flows, and auroral arcs) processes. In our discussion,\nwe outline how the coordinated use of Cluster and ground-\nbased data has advanced our understanding of geospace phe-\nnomena, and what major contributions are expected in the\nfuture not only from this program, but also from the coordi-\nnated use of ground-based data and upcoming constellation\nand cluster-class missions.\n2 Instrumentation, techniques and models\nIn this section, we present the relevant instruments and tech-\nniques used to relate measured quantities to the physical\nquantities of interest, and some issues related to the empiri-\ncal models most commonly used for mapping. We finish this\nsection with a discussion of physics-based and assimilative\nmodels, which are now coming to the fore as important tools\nfor studying the geospace system. We use a broad-brush\nhere, for brevity sake, and we are in no way trying to present\na complete review of this important aspect of geospace sci-\nence. Rather, we limit our attention to instruments and tech-\nniques used in studies discussed in this paper.\n2.1 Instruments\nOn the ground, the international community operates an ex-\ntensive and diverse collection of instruments, such as flux-\ngate and induction coil magnetometers, VLF (Very Low Fre-\nquency) receivers, coherent (High Frequency, HF, and Very\nHigh Frequency, VHF) and incoherent scatter radars, merid-\nian scanning photometers (MSPs), spectrographs, all-sky im-\nagers (ASIs), and imaging and integrating riometers. These\ninstruments are operated individually and as part of national\nand even international networks. They extend from the heart\nof Antarctica to near the geographic north pole. Nations from\nevery continent are involved in this global effort. In a very\nreal sense these instruments provide us with our only true\nglobal measurements. The co-ordinated use of ground-based\ninstruments certainly provides us with our most complete\npicture of smaller-scale ionospheric electrodynamics. Data\nfrom all of these instrument types are widely discussed in\nthe literature. We refer the reader to the \u201cSatellite - Ground-\nBased Coordination Sourcebook\u201d (Lockwood et al., 1997)\nfor reviews of various instrument types, their data, and de-\nscriptions of important international observing networks.\nFluxgate magnetometers measure the vector magnetic\nfield on the ground. The sample rate varies, but most sys-\ntems obtain data at a rate of roughly 1 Hz. Magnetometers\nO. Amm et al.: Coordinated Cluster and ground-based studies 2133\noperate continuously, delivering a rather coarse picture of\nthe two-dimensional ionospheric current systems subject to\nfundamental limitations imposed by ground-induced currents\nand the smoothing effect of the 100 km or more distance be-\ntween the magnetic field sources and the detector. Fluxgate\nmagnetometers are operated as parts of international and na-\ntional arrays (see, e.g. Rostoker et al., 1995; Engebretson et\nal., 1995), and individually, and the result is an essentially\nworldwide array of these instruments (see, e.g. Fig. 1 of Lu\net al., 1995). New techniques to maximize the extraction of\ninformation from dense magnetometer arrays are discussed\nin Subsect. 2.2.\nMSPs and ASIs are typically used to detect auroral emis-\nsions through narrow band-pass filters centered on important\nauroral emission lines and bands (see, e.g. Deehr and Lum-\nmerzheim, 2001, and Syrja\u00a8suo et al., 1998). The spatial res-\nolution afforded by optical data is much better than that of\nmagnetometer data, and the optical data allows one to infer\nat least some information about the spectrum of precipitating\nparticles (see discussion in Sect. 2.2). The usefulness of op-\ntical observations is limited, however, by often poor viewing\nconditions (i.e. clouds, twilight, etc.), as well as uncertainties\nin the emission height and hence in the location of the source\nfor off-zenith observations.\nRiometers measure HF radio wave absorption due to en-\nhanced ionization in the lower ionosphere. This absorp-\ntion is a quantitative proxy for the precipitation of high en-\nergy diffuse and discrete auroral electrons and very high en-\nergy solar protons. Riometers give little, if any, informa-\ntion about the spectrum of the precipitating particles, but can\nmap out the two-dimensional evolution of the inner magne-\ntospheric, high-energy electron population under favorable\ncircumstances (Baker et al., 1981).\nThe Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) is\na network of HF coherent scatter radars which encircle the\nnorthern and southern polar regions (Greenwald et al., 1995).\nThe overlapping fields of view (FOVs) of SuperDARN cover\nmuch of the auroral and polar cap regions in both the North-\nern and Southern Hemispheres. These radars normally scan\nin 16 successive directions, with 75 range gates which are\n45 km in extent. Each radar measures the backscatter power\nfrom ionospheric irregularities, the Doppler or line-of-sight\n(LOS) velocity of the irregularities, and a parameter termed\nthe spectral width, which is a measure of the decorrelation\ntime of the irregularities. Pairs of radars with overlapping\nfields of view can provide vector measurements of the iono-\nspheric drift velocity. VHF radars, such as STARE (\u201cScandi-\nnavian Twin Auroral Radar Experiment\u201d), operate at higher\nfrequencies, and obtain echoes from E-region waves (see,\ne.g. Greenwald et al., 1978). The Doppler velocity can be\nrelated, with some caveats, to the local velocity in the E-\nregion. The VHF radars provide a higher spatial resolution\nmap of ionospheric convection than the SuperDARN radars,\nalthough their ability to obtain echoes is more sensitive to the\nmagnetic aspect angle and they have smaller FOVs.\nIncoherent scatter radars (ISRs) utilize powerful high-\nfrequency (>\u223c50 MHz) transmitters, and plain or phase-\ncoded pulses. Ionospheric electrons oscillate in response to\nthe electric field of the radar transmitted wave, and these os-\ncillating electrons, in turn, radiate electromagnetic waves, the\nfrequency of which changes according to the movement of\neach electron. ISRs observe signals from many electrons si-\nmultaneously. In the ionospheric plasma the electrons partly\nfollow the motion of the much heavier ions, and the backscat-\nter observed by the radars comes not from the individual\nelectrons, but from collective processes (Langmuir and ion-\nacoustic waves) arising from the natural oscillatory modes\nof the plasma. Since the scattering process depends on the\nproperties of both electrons and ions, the received signal is\nrich in physical content. From the power and the shape of\nthe spectrum one can determine electron density, electron\ntemperature, ion temperature, ion drift speed and the colli-\nsion frequency between ions and molecules along the radar\nline-of-sight. Bi-static or tri-static radars combine such scat-\nter information from a given ionospheric volume as obtained\nfrom two or three radar stations. From these basic incoherent\nscatter parameters, several quantities can be calculated, for\nexample: ionospheric electric field, ionospheric electric cur-\nrents, energy and flux of the precipitating particles, conduc-\ntivities, heating rates, neutral winds, temperatures, etc.. This\nability to measure or to infer so many of the fundamental\nparameters of the ionosphere and upper atmosphere makes\nincoherent scatter a uniquely powerful technique in the study\nof the geospace plasma environment. Specifically, to sup-\nport Cluster observations of the cusp, cleft, magnetosheath,\nand bow shock, a new incoherent scatter radar facility was\nconstructed on Svalbard.\nThe EISCAT (European Incoherent Scatter) Svalbard\nradar has been operational since 1996. Just one of its many\nunique advantages is that it is at a high enough geographic\nlatitude so that it has a view of the dark cusp for several\nmonths of the year. Consequently, optical experiments, such\nas photometers, spectrometers, and a surprising number of\nall-sky imagers, have sprouted up around this facility, mak-\ning it the preeminent cusp research facility in the world.\nObservations by Cluster, in conjunction with high power\nradio wave transmitters and heaters, such as the EISCAT\nHeater (Stubbe et al., 1982), SPEAR (Wright et al., 2000)\nor HAARP (Bell et al., 2004), have also been undertaken.\nThe HAARP facility was able to trigger waves in the iono-\nsphere which were subsequently detected, at the highest al-\ntitude ever, by Cluster (Bell et al., 2004). It is likely that\nsuch studies will form a major new area of research during\nthe remainder of the Cluster mission.\nAs discussed in the Introduction, in space physics, global\nauroral images from space are utilized in essentially the\nsame fashion as is ground-based data. The NASA IMAGE\n(National Aeronautics and Space Administration Imager for\nMagnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration) satellite was\nlaunched in March of 2000. IMAGE carries two global au-\nroral imaging instruments which together comprise the Far\nUltraviolet Instrument (FUV). The Wideband Imaging Cam-\nera (WIC) provides global images of primarily the N2 LBH\n(Lyman-Birge-Hopfield) band. The Spectroscopic Imager\n2134 O.

The SI13 channel is sensitive to the\n135.6 nm OI doublet. The WIC and SI13 instruments are\nprimarily electron auroral imagers, but it is important to rec-\nognize that precipitating protons, via secondary processes,\ncan give rise to these emissions, as well (see, e.g. Frey et al.,\n2001). The FUV instrument package is described in detail\nby Mende et al. (2000).\nOf course, the complement to the ground-based instru-\nmentation are the in-situ instruments carried on board Clus-\nter. Each Cluster satellite carries the same set of eleven\ninstruments that allow for the measurement of electric and\nmagnetic fields from DC to high frequencies, and the detec-\ntion of electron and ion distribution functions at spin reso-\nlution. An overview of this instrument complement is given\nby Escoubet et al. (1997, 2001). The individual instruments,\ntheir respective Principal Investigators (PIs), and references\nfor the description of the instruments, are listed in Table 1.\n2.2 Techniques\nThe instruments described in Sect. 2.1 measure physical\nquantities that must be further analysed in order to generate\nthe information needed for a particular application. While\nthe bulk of this subsection is devoted to techniques that are\napplied to ground-based data, we begin with a brief com-\nment about satellite data analysis. Many of the techniques\nused in multi-spacecraft data analysis have been described\nin Paschmann and Daly (1998). While most can be applied\nto single spacecraft data, such as spectral analysis and the\nmeasurement of the moments of the plasma velocity distri-\nbution, some can only be applied to multi-spacecraft obser-\nvations, such as discontinuity analysis and spatial gradient\nmeasurements. Two such techniques that have been widely\nutilized in coordinated Cluster-Ground based studies are the\nCurlometer (Dunlop et al., 2002a) and the discontinuity anal-\nyser (Dunlop et al., 2002b). The Curlometer estimates the\naverage current density in the vicinity of the satellites. It\ncan be used at the magnetopause, to determine the magne-\ntopause current, or in the tail to determine the evolution of\nthe tail current. The discontinuity analyser, on the other hand\nestimates the motion, geometry and orientation of a bound-\nary or discontinuity, such as the magnetopause, the plasma\nsheet boundary, or the tail current. Both techniques are inher-\nently multi-spacecraft (i.e. there is no single satellite equiva-\nlent measurement) and provide important information for so-\nlar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling and substorm\nstudies.\nWe start the discussion of ground-based techniques with\nthe quantitative inversion of auroral images which is based\non the brightness ratio of two emissions which are either\nexcited or absorbed differently. Many investigations use\nthe ratio between the visible oxygen red 3P\u22121D transition\n630.0 nm duplet and the blue 1N N2+ band emission at\n427.8 nm. The red oxygen emission is primarily excited by\nlow energy (<1 keV) electrons. At high altitudes (>180 km)\nthis emission is mostly undisturbed while at lower altitudes\n(<130 km) the excited oxygen atoms are often deexcited\nby collisions with other atmospheric constituents. The blue\nemission of nitrogen molecules is mostly excited by higher\nenergy (>1 keV) electrons at lower altitudes. The ratio of\nthe red\/blue emission is therefore a measure of the mean\nenergy of precipitating electrons (Rees and Luckey, 1974;\nKaila, 1989; Janhunen, 2001).\nIn the ultraviolet regime, which is applicable to imagers\nflown on spacecraft, such as Polar and IMAGE, there are\nauroral emissions from the oxygen OI transitions at 130.4\nand 135.6 nm, the nitrogen molecule Lyman-Birge-Hopfield\n(LBHs) band at 120\u2013250 nm, and several strong nitrogen\natom emissions, for instance, at 149.5 and 174.3 nm. The\nmolecular oxygen absorption in the Schumann-Runge band\nstrongly absorbs below 160 nm and reduces the amount of\nphotons that could be observed from an imager in space\nO. Amm et al.: Coordinated Cluster and ground-based studies 2135\n(Germany et al., 1997). The region of LBHs emission at\n140\u2013160 nm that undergoes strong atmospheric absorption is\ngenerally referred to as the LBH region. The mostly undis-\nturbed, higher wavelength region of LBH emissions at 160\u2013\n190 nm is generally referred to as the LBHl region. The LBH\nemission is excited by direct electron impact on nitrogen\nmolecules, and the different wavelength emissions are only\ndetermined by the branching ratios of N2 (Vallance-Jones,\n1974). The ratio between LBHs and LBHl is therefore in-\ntrinsically fixed, however, depending on the altitude where\nthe emission is excited this ratio can change with electron\nenergy. As high energy electrons penetrate deeper into the\natmosphere (below 120 km) their excited LBHs emission un-\ndergoes strong absorption while the LBHl remains mostly\nundisturbed. Therefore, the LBHl band can then be used to\ndetermine the input energy flux (Germany et al., 1997). A\nsimilar approach uses the strongly absorbed 135.6-nm emis-\nsion to LBH ratio, yet this has the additional complication\nof the unknown atmospheric O\/N2 ratio (Frey et al., 2003a).\nKnowing the global distribution of precipitating electron en-\nergy, their energy flux can lead to a global estimate of iono-\nspheric conductance (Robinson et al., 1987; Germany et al.,\n1994; Semeter and Doe, 2002).\nThe assimilative mapping of ionospheric electrodynamics\n(AMIE) procedure (Richmond and Kamide, 1988) is one of\nthe most commonly used methods for deriving global distri-\nbutions of ionospheric electrodynamics. For all input data\nsets used with this technique, exact or empirical relations to\nthe ionospheric electric field distribution are devised. The\nelectric field is then solved as a primary output, using an opti-\nmisation approach. This gives AMIE the flexibility to utilize\nmany different types of data sets, such as ground magnetic\ndata, ionospheric electric field data from radars or satellite\nmeasurements, optical data and particle precipitation data.\nNot every input data set has to cover the full analysis re-\ngion, as it is required for forward methods that are based on\nthe solution of algebraic or differential equations. On the\nother hand, \u201ca priori\u201d information from statistical models of\nthe ionospheric Hall and Pedersen conductances (e.g. Fuller-\nRowell and Evans, 1987) and of the ionospheric convection\n(e.g. Foster et al., 1986) need to be used in areas where no\nmeasurements are available. This limits the ability of the\ntechnique to adequatly describe single events, and it is diffi-\ncult to estimate the uncertainty of the results in regions where\nthe density of actually measured data is sparse. With the\ncombined set of \u201ca priori\u201d data, measured data, and the elec-\ntric field output distribution, the full set of macroscopic iono-\nspheric electrodynamic parameters can be calculated. Until\nnow, AMIE has been only available for global-scale analy-\nses, and has, for example, been successfully used in order\nto analyse the response of the ionospheric electrodynamics\nto different conditions of the interplanetary magnetic field\n(IMF) (e.g. Lu et al., 1995, 2002).\nThe KRM (Kamide-Richmond-Matsushita-Mishin) tech-\nnique (Kamide et al., 1981) also provides global distributions\nof the ionospheric electric potential by combining ground\nmagnetometer data and a model of the ionospheric conduc-\ntances, in order to solve a second-order differential equation\nfor the potential. While this approach has been successfully\nused on a global scale for regional analyses, the unknown\nboundary conditions cause substantial uncertainty in the re-\nsults (Murison et al., 1985).\nTwo methods for deriving ionospheric electrodynamics\nfrom combined ground-based and multi-satellite observa-\ntions have been specifically developed for use with Cluster\ndata: The Elementary Current Method (ECM; Amm, 2001)\nand the field-aligned current (FAC)-based method of charac-\nteristics (Amm, 2002). Both methods use the FAC derived\nfrom the four Cluster satellites, mapped to the ionosphere, as\nan input, in order to derive a spatial distribution of the iono-\nspheric FAC. The way in which this is done depends on the\ngeometry of the satellites\u2019 magnetic footprints in the iono-\nsphere, and on whether or not a stationary ionospheric struc-\nture can be assumed to be moving through the area under\nanalysis (see Amm, 2001, for more details). It is most suit-\nable to apply these techniques when the spacing of Cluster\u2019s\nmagnetic footprints in the ionosphere is comparable or larger\nthan the spacing of the ground-based data points. Both meth-\nods are forward methods, i.e. no optimisation procedures are\nused but algebraic or differential equations are solved with\nthe data as input.\nThe ECM method combines the FAC with ionospheric\nequivalent currents, as derived from ground-based magne-\ntometer data (see below) as inputs. Its primary outputs are\nthe true ionospheric currents. The ECM method makes use\nof the fact that the divergence-free part of the true currents\nequals the ionospheric equivalent currents, and their curl-free\npart can be derived from the FAC. Spherical elementary cur-\nrent systems (Amm, 1997) are used to expand both parts of\nthe currents, with their sum being the true currents. If iono-\nspheric electric field data are available (e.g. from VHF or HF\nradar measurements), the ionospheric conductances can be\nalso derived directly using Ohm\u2019s law in the ionosphere.\nThe FAC-based method of characteristics combines the\nFAC with data of the ionospheric electric field. Using an\nestimate of the Hall to Pedersen conductance ratio, the Hall\nconductance is calculated by solving a first-order differential\nequation, from which, together with the input data set and\nthe estimate of the conductance ratio, the remaining macro-\nscopic ionospheric electrodynamic parameters can be calcu-\nlated. While depending on the structure of the electric field,\nunknown boundary values may affect the solution on parts of\nthe area to be analysed; these areas are known and an error\nestimate is inherently available. The FAC-based version of\nthe method of characteristics does not require ground mag-\nnetic field data. This method has, for example, been used by\nMarchaudon et al. (2004a) to analyse the electrodynamics of\nan auroral spiral.\nThe FAC-based method of characteristics is mathemat-\nically very similar to the older JEQ (equivalent current)-\nbased method of characteristics (Inhester et al., 1992; Amm,\n1995, 1998), which combines ionospheric equivalent cur-\nrents and electric field data, in order to yield the same out-\nput as the FAC-based version. Since the JEQ-based version\n2136 O. Amm et al.: Coordinated Cluster and ground-based studies\nuses ground-based data only, it can also be applied also if the\nmagnetic footprint geometry makes it impossible to derive\ntwo-dimensional FAC distributions from Cluster. The results\nof the method can be compared quantitatively with the Clus-\nter observations, as has been done by Amm et al. (2003) (see\nalso Sect. 4.2).\nThe ECM method and the JEQ-based method of character-\nistics require as an input the ionospheric equivalent currents\nwhich can be calculated from the ground magnetic distur-\nbance data measured by magnetometers. An advanced tech-\nnique to perform this magnetic field upward continuation is\nthe Spherical Elementary Current Method (SECS; Amm and\nViljanen, 1999). In this method, the ground magnetic field is\nrepresented as a sum of the magnetic field effects of a number\nof divergence-free, ionospheric, elementary current systems.\nThe magnitude of each of the elementary systems is adjusted\nsuch that the measured ground magnetic field is optimally\nmatched. Once the magnitude of each elementary system is\ndetermined, the ionospheric equivalent currents can directly\nbe expanded as superpositions of these differently weighted\nelementary current systems.\nSuperDARN LOS Doppler velocity measurements are\nwidely utilized to directly infer F-region plasma motions.\nThe worldwide array allows the inference of the global con-\nvection pattern, subject to there being an adequate number of\nscatterers. The LOS velocities from all Northern or Southern\nHemisphere radars can be combined using a more sophisti-\ncated analysis technique termed the map potential analysis\n(Ruohoniemi and Baker, 1998). This technique fits a spher-\nical harmonic expansion to the potential pattern associated\nwith the measured ionospheric flow using a model of iono-\nspheric flow, generated from a single Northern Hemisphere\nHF radar at Goose Bay (Ruohoniemi and Greenwald, 1996)\nto seed the expansion where there are no data. The model\nis parameterized by the IMF (Interplanetary Magnetic Field)\nclock angle and magnitude, while the lower latitude limit of\nthe potential pattern is determined by the lowest latitude F-\nregion ionospheric scatter. This technique is therefore ideal\nfor providing a large spatial coverage observations of the\nionospheric convection, which is near global at times. In ad-\ndition, the cross polar cap potential can be estimated from\nthe maximum and minimum values. The standard time reso-\nlution used is 2 min.\nSuperDARN measurements of convection provide us with\na global, albeit two-dimensional, time-evolving map of the\nprojection of the magnetospheric convection. This picture is\naugmented by ionospheric electric field measurements from\npolar orbiting spacecraft, such as FAST (Fast Auroral Snap-\nshot Explorer) and DMSP, data from magnetometers, digital\nionosondes and incoherent scatter radars. The use of iono-\nspheric convection observations to infer magnetospheric con-\nvection is limited by our understanding of the magnetic field\ntopology and the relationship between the magnetospheric\nand ionospheric electric potential distributions. Understand-\ning of the field-aligned potential distribution and the mag-\nnetic field topology would allow us to use ionospheric con-\nvection measurements to infer the correct magnetospheric\nconvection pattern.\n2.3 Mapping between the ionosphere and magnetosphere\nThe question of magnetic mapping is of central importance\nin virtually all magnetospheric studies involving coordinated\nuse of ionospheric and in-situ observations. Empirical mag-\nnetic field models, such as the T87, T89, and T01 models (see\nTsyganenko, 1987, 1989, 2002a,b) have been widely used for\nplanning conjunctions, and as a necessary step when plac-\ning magnetospheric observations in a more global context, in\nboth cases by providing at least estimates of magnetic foot-\npoint locations. Such empirical models in general, their use\nin coordinated satellite ground-based studies, and potential\npitfalls in their use, are discussed by Pulkkinen et al. (1998)\nand Hapgood (1998). Empirical models are widely used in\nthe studies reviewed in this paper. As we point out in the\nfollowing paragraphs, however, Cluster has presented an ex-\nciting new opportunity to test the validity of field line map-\npings and the commonly used assumption that (for mapping\npurposes) field lines are electric equipotentials.\nProvided field-aligned potential drops are small relative to\nthe cross-polar cap potential, it is reasonable to impose the\ncondition that field lines are equipotentials and simply map\nthe convection pattern out to the magnetosphere (Bostro\u00a8m,\n1967). Even in applications where this assumption is valid,\nthe uncertainties in mapping significantly limit how useful\nionospheric convection measurements are in terms of provid-\ning information about magnetospheric convection (Donovan\nand Rostoker, 1991). Of course, in most interesting appli-\ncations, the assumption of equipotential field lines is highly\nquestionable. Rapidly changing magnetospheric topologies\ngo hand in hand with induced electric fields that do not map\nto the ionosphere, and a curl in the parallel electric field\n(i.e. a gradient in the parallel electric field orthogonal to the\nfield line direction) can significantly distort the potential pat-\ntern from the one inferred using the equipotential assumption\n(Newcomb, 1958; Hesse et al., 1997). To date, the only way\nto explore the limitations in mapping potential distributions\nbetween the magnetosphere and ionosphere has been to uti-\nlize models and simulations (see, e.g. Hesse et al., 1997).\nFor several hours on 12 March 2001, the Cluster space-\ncraft were magnetically conjugate to a region of the iono-\nsphere which was at the time yielding excellent SuperDARN\nconvection measurements. The satellites were outbound over\nthe northern polar regions. Baker et al. (2003) used Super-\nDARN convection measurements, in conjunction with the\n\u201cT01\u201d magnetic field model (Tsyganenko 2002a,b), and the\naforementioned equipotential field line assumption, to in-\nfer transverse electric fields in the vicinity of the spacecraft.\nThey found excellent agreement between the in-situ (EDI)\nand the mapped (SuperDARN) electric field during much\nof the interval. There were brief periods of disagreement,\nhowever, which were attributed to errors in mapping and the\ndecoupling of the ionospheric and magnetospheric electric\npotentials due to geomagnetic activity. In a demonstration\nthat mapping errors were a plausible source for some of the\nO. Amm et al.: Coordinated Cluster and ground-based studies 2137\ndiscrepancies, the authors found that by moving the mag-\nnetic footpoints slightly from those determined from the T01\nmodel, they could improve the agreement between the in-situ\n(EDI) and mapped (SuperDARN) electric fields. This need\nfor \u201coptimization\u201d, they argued, reflected ever-present, slight\nmapping errors. As well, they found that during one of the\nperiods of disagreement, multi-spacecraft FGM and ground-\nbased optical and riometer data showed that Cluster was in\nthe vicinity of field-aligned currents which can reasonably\nbe expected to affect the mapping. The discrepancies also\ncoincided with a series of pseudo-breakups, leading up to a\nbreakup, all of which would produce induced electric fields\nin the magnetosphere, as well as highly structured parallel\nelectric fields.\nThe Baker et al. (2003) study was only a first step. The\nauthors present their work as an introduction of an impor-\ntant new technique that needs further testing and that will\nprovide important insights into the connection between the\nionospheric and magnetospheric potential patterns. Their re-\nsults clearly demonstrate that the technique works. Although\nthey only used EDI data from one satellite for the bulk of\ntheir study, their results are an important first step in attack-\ning the difficulties that have perennially plagued the use of\nionospheric measurements to study magnetospheric convec-\ntion. They point out that the next step on this research path\nis to use multi-point EDI data to explore the gradient across\nthe magnetic field direction of the parallel electric field in\nsituations like their event.\n2.4 Numerical models\nWhile empirical models will remain an essential tool in our\nfield for years to come, there are clearly significant limi-\ntations on how much information we can truly glean from\nthem in event studies. Improvements can be made by design-\ning models that are primarily analytical (i.e. like the Tsyga-\nnenko models discussed above), but that can be constrained\nby event-specific parameters. Such event-based modelling\nwas initiated by Pulkkinen et al. (1991). Assimilative models\nprovide the opportunity to blend data from different sources\n(such as ground-based arrays and global images), together\nwith an empirical model and some physical constraints. The\nultimate objective, of course, is to have more physics-based\nmodels that are derived from realistic simulations and con-\nstrained by data. These models would then provide not only\ncontext, but a powerful means for exploring the relevant\nphysics.\nCurrently there are several functioning MHD (Magne-\ntoHydroDynamic) codes designed to solve the entire so-\nlar wind - magnetosphere - ionosphere system. Some of\nthe widely known examples are the Lyon-Fedder-Mobarry\ncode (LFM; Fedder et al., 1995), BAT-R-US code (Powell\net al., 1999), Geospace General Circulation Model (GGCM,\nRaeder et al., 1998), and GUMICS-4 (Janhunen, 1996). The\nglobal view of such simulations is a valuable reference in the\nstudies of the mesoscale auroral phenomena. An interest-\ning example are the bursty bulk flows which appear in global\nMHD-simulations (Wiltberger et al., 2000) and are currently\nbeing investigated extensively with combined ground-based\nand Cluster observations.\nThe combination of Cluster and ground-based observa-\ntions has the potential to provide a new, more direct way to\nprobe a number of problems which have been identified in\ncomparison between model and observations. One particu-\nlar area where co-ordinated observations could play a cru-\ncial role is near perigee, which is close to the altitude of the\nMHD-regime inner boundary (for most MHD models near\n3RE geocentric distance, i.e. close to the Cluster perigee\nof 4RE), while ground-based instrumentation would mon-\nitor the simultaneous ionospheric conditions. Other mod-\nels include ionospheric models, such as the TRANSCAR\nmodel (Blelly et al., 1996) which is a one-dimensional, time-\ndependent ionospheric model, coupled to a suprathermal\nelectron transport code. Such models have yet to be utilised\nin terms of Cluster - ground-based research, but their use is\nforeseen as important to the continued activity in this area.\n3 Dayside processes\n3.1 Introduction\nSolar wind energy and momentum are predominantly trans-\nferred to the terrestrial magnetosphere via coupling processes\nat the dayside magnetopause. Magnetic reconnection is ar-\nguably the most significant of these mechanisms, yet the na-\nture, location and factors controlling the reconnection pro-\ncess remain unclear. The energy transport process begins\nwhen interplanetary and terrestrial magnetic field lines first\nbreak, then reconnect with one another (sometimes referred\nto as merging), resulting in the creation of an open magnetic\nfield line anchored at one end to the terrestrial magnetic field,\nwith the other end embedded in the IMF. The coupling of\nthe IMF and terrestrial magnetic field has two crucial impli-\ncations. Firstly, solar wind plasma can penetrate the mag-\nnetopause and enter the magnetospheric cavity. Simultane-\nously, magnetospheric plasma can escape along the recon-\nnected magnetic field lines. Secondly, reconnected magnetic\nfield lines are dragged tailward by magnetic tension and the\nanti-sunward motion of the solar wind, resulting in the effec-\ntive transfer of momentum and energy from the solar wind to\nthe magnetosphere.\nThe level of coupling between the solar wind\/IMF and\nthe magnetosphere is sensitive to the orientation of the IMF.\nIf the IMF is directed purely southward (negative BZ), re-\nconnection is expected to occur mainly at the low-latitude\nmagnetopause (in the vicinity of the subsolar point), where\nthe magnetic shear between the southward pointing inter-\nplanetary magnetic field and the northward pointing mag-\nnetospheric field is the greatest. In this simple case, mag-\nnetic reconnection increases the amount of open magnetic\nflux which must inevitably be incorporated into the Earth\u2019s\nmagnetic tail, and increases the size of the open polar cap.\nThis loading of energy into the Earth\u2019s magnetotail drives\n2138 O. Amm et al.: Coordinated Cluster and ground-based studies\nthe convective Dungey cycle (Dungey, 1961) and is ulti-\nmately responsible for many of the nightside phenomena dis-\ncussed in later sections. Magnetospheric convection is im-\nposed upon the ionosphere, resulting in a twin-cell flow pat-\ntern characterised by an anti-sunward flow across the polar\ncap and a sunward flow at lower latitudes. In the contra-\ndictory case, when the IMF is directed northward (positive\nBZ), the magnetic shear at the subsolar point is greatly re-\nduced. However, as northward pointed magnetic field lines\nare carried anti-sunward by the solar wind, they drape over\nthe nose of the magnetopause. This draping results in a large\nmagnetic shear at some locations, most notably in the region\ntailward of the magnetic cusps, where draped antisunward,\ninterplanetary magnetic field lines overlay earthward (and\nsunward) pointing terrestrial fields in the lobes of the magne-\ntotail. Consequently, during northward pointing IMF the re-\nconnection process does not cease. Instead, the reconnection\nsite is thought to shift to higher latitudes. Of course, nature\nis rarely as simple as the simple northward\/southward ori-\nented IMF scenarios introduced here. In reality, the orienta-\ntion of the IMF is highly variable over short time scales (min)\nand usually exhibits intermediate orientations. In these cases,\nthe location and rate of reconnection are not clear-cut, and it\nis likely that some blurring of the northward and southward\nIMF paradigms occurs, with reconnection possibly occurring\nat multiple locations over the magnetopause. Previous satel-\nlite missions have confirmed that the rate of reconnection is\nhighest during intervals when there is a southward directed\ncomponent of the IMF. At these times, flux transfer events\n(FTEs), the characteristic signatures of newly-opened mag-\nnetic flux tubes in the vicinity of the dayside magnetopause,\nwere frequently observed at equatorial- and mid-latitudes.\nHowever, during intervals when the IMF contained a north-\nward component, FTEs were typically observed at higher\nlatitudes (e.g. Berchem and Russell, 1984; Rijnbeek et al.,\n1984; Kawano et al., 1992; Russell et al., 1996).\nStudies of the magnetospheric cusps have yielded insight\ninto the reconnection process under various IMF orienta-\ntions. Since the cusps lie at the demarcation point between\nclosed and open magnetic field lines, many signatures of day-\nside reconnection are naturally focused into a relatively small\nspatial region, in both the magnetosphere and ionosphere. A\nstill much-debated topic in cusp research is the question of\nwhether cusp structures are predominantly temporal or\/and\nspatial in nature, an issue that is related to the question of\nwhether reconnection is quasi-steady or transient. Attempts\nto resolve this issue have not proved conclusive. Several prior\nstudies have suggested that observed cusp structures are con-\nsistent with time-varying reconnection (e.g. Cowley et al.,\n1991; Lockwood and Smith, 1989, 1994; Lockwood, 1995;\nLockwood et al., 1995) while other studies have suggested\nspatial, rather than temporal, structuring of the cusp (Trat-\ntner et al., 1999, 2002).\nPrior to the launch of Cluster, the numerous networks\nof ground-based instruments and auroral imaging spacecraft\ndescribed in Sect. 2.1 were employed in order to exploit\nthe conjugacy of magnetospheric structures (observed by\nsatellite) with their ionospheric counterparts. While the of-\nten inferior spatial resolution offered by ground-based mea-\nsurements has been compensated for by massively extended\nfields-of-view and almost continuous data acquisition, the\nadvent of Cluster has enabled a plethora of truly multi-point,\nmulti-scale investigations of the structure and dynamics of\nthe dayside magnetosphere and ionosphere. We shall there-\nfore organise this section by presenting reviews of Cluster\nand ground-based investigations of magnetic reconnection\nunder southward and northward IMF orientations, before re-\nviewing those studies concerning the temporal variability of\nthe reconnection process via measurements in the cusp.\n3.2 Dayside reconnection under southward IMF\nOf all the solar wind\/magnetosphere coupling scenarios, the\nsouthward IMF paradigm is arguably the most developed.\nThe concept of low- and mid-latitude reconnection driv-\ning large-scale magnetospheric and ionospheric convection\nis generally accepted, although the determination of the ex-\nact location, extent and temporal variability of the reconnec-\ntion mechanism continues to stimulate passionate discussion.\nThe potential for Cluster to address these outstanding ques-\ntions has, unsurprisingly, resulted in a whole raft of studies\nduring intervals of southward IMF.\nDuring the first weeks of the Cluster mission\u2019s science\nphase in February and March 2001, the spacecraft orbited\nthe Earth roughly in the noon-midnight meridian. Since\napogee lay in the upstream solar wind, interest from ground-\nbased investigators was focussed upon intervals during which\nthe spacecraft traversed the polar cap, high-altitude cusp,\nand encountered the high-latitude magnetopause. Wild et\nal. (2001, 2003) studied one such outbound pass through\nthe post-noon, high-latitude magnetopause between 09:15\nand 11:15 UT on 14 February 2001. During the whole\nperiod of interest, the IMF was essentially southward and\nduskward. The Cluster spacecraft observed magnetic field\nperturbations in the magnetosphere with four clear signatures\nof FTEs. They then entered into a highly-structured mag-\nnetopause boundary layer, followed by 3 successive magne-\ntopause crossings (outbound\/inbound\/outbound), and defini-\ntively entered the magnetosheath where FTEs was also ob-\nserved. Whilst in the magnetosphere, the magnetic footprint\nof Cluster was located in the mid-afternoon sector dayside\nionosphere at 14:30 MLT. In the Northern Hemisphere, this\nposition fell within the fields-of-view of the CUTLASS Su-\nperDARN radars and the field-aligned beam of the ESR radar\n(Wild et al., 2001), and within the field-of-view of the Syowa\nEast SuperDARN radar in the Southern Hemisphere (Wild et\nal., 2003). The SuperDARN radars, at magnetically conju-\ngate locations in both hemispheres, revealed the ionospheric\nsignatures of FTEs.\nIn the first of this pair of papers (Wild et al., 2001), the\nCluster data were limited to the FGM magnetic field mea-\nsurements. The FTEs were characterised by an increase in\nthe magnetic field amplitude and a bipolar signature in the\nmagnetic field component normal to the magnetopause, as\nO. Amm et al.: Coordinated Cluster and ground-based studies 2139\npreviously observed by Russell and Elphic (1978). Subse-\nquent examination of Cluster plasma data allowed the au-\nthors to confirm their interpretation of the FTEs in the mag-\nnetosphere and in the magnetosheath, characterised by a mix-\nture of magnetospheric and magnetosheath plasma popula-\ntions (Wild et al., 2003). The field tilting effects associated\nwith each FTE were consistent with a reconnection site lo-\ncated at the dusk magnetopause (in agreement with the pos-\nitive IMF BY ), with the resulting newly-opened flux tubes\ncarried in the north-westerly direction in the Northern Hemi-\nsphere by magnetic tension and magnetosheath flow.\nThe Northern Hemisphere radar data during this interval\n(Wild et al., 2001) comprised ESR and CUTLASS Super-\nDARN data. The CUTLASS Finland SuperDARN radar,\nconjugate with Cluster and pointing essentially northward,\nobserved two different regions of echoes, each located west-\nward of the Cluster footprint. The low-latitude region be-\ntween 74\u25e6 and 76\u25e6 MLAT was characterised by low iono-\nspheric velocities essentially westward and northward, in\nagreement with the positive IMF BY , and detailed study\nof this region revealed pulses of ionospheric flow and of\nbackscatter power. The high-latitude region above 76 MLAT\nincluded poleward-moving regions of enhanced flow and\nbackscattered power, signatures characteristic of FTEs (Pin-\nnock et al., 1995) that followed each of the pulses in the\nlow-latitude region. These data are presented in Figs. 3a and\nb. Examination of the Cluster and SuperDARN data indi-\ncated a clear one-to-one correlation between the signatures\nof magnetospheric FTEs observed by Cluster and the pulsed\nenhancements of convection and power observed by the Fin-\nland radar. These observations suggested that the reconnec-\ntion events had a large spatial scale and that the low-latitude\nflow region corresponded to the footprint of newly-opened\nflux tubes. The poleward convection enhancements observed\nat higher latitudes were the fossil-like signatures of the re-\nconnected flux tubes in the ionosphere. This inference was\nsupported by enhancements of the electron density (associ-\nated with cusp precipitation) observed in the low-latitude re-\ngion by the ESR radar.\nThe ionospheric convection geometry provided by the\nCUTLASS radars confirmed the dusk location of the mag-\nnetopause reconnection site inferred from the Cluster data.\nThe subsequent study of magnetically conjugate Syowa East\nSuperDARN radar observations in the Southern Hemisphere\n(Wild et al., 2003) again revealed modulations of the convec-\ntion flow at low latitudes and poleward convection enhance-\nments at high latitudes, as presented in Figs. 3b and c. These\nflow modulations were well correlated with the flow pulsa-\ntions observed by the SuperDARN Finland radar and with\nthe magnetic perturbations observed by Cluster. As expected,\nthe reconnected flux tubes in the Southern Hemisphere prop-\nagated poleward and eastward, the asymmetry between the\nhemispheres being due to the non-zero BY component of the\nIMF. However, the location of this radar around noon MLT\nimplied that the reconnected flux tubes had to be generated\non the dawn magnetopause, in order to propagate duskward\nthough the field-of-view of the radar. Consequently, the re-\nFig. 3.

(b) The mean velocity averaged over the latitude range\nindicated by dashed horizontal lines in (a) and (c) (and given pos-\nitive values in this case, though in each case the flow is directed\naway from the radars). The indigo trace corresponds to the Finland\naverage velocities, whilst the red trace corresponds to the Syowa\nEast average velocities. Superimposed on each panel are the times\nof FTEs, boundary layer (BL), and magnetopause (MP) encounters\nidentified in the Cluster observations. (From Wild et al., 2003.)\nconnected flux tubes observed in the southern ionosphere\nwere not the same as the reconnected flux tubes seen simul-\ntaneously by the Finland radar and Cluster. However, the\nconvection flow modulations seen simultaneously in the two\nhemispheres in both the pre- and post-noon sectors supported\nthe idea that the reconnection occurred along a single recon-\nnection line extending over at least 4 h MLT. The ground-\nbased data in the Southern Hemisphere were thus necessary\nto infer the large-scale geometry of the magnetopause recon-\nnection in this case.\nSeveral authors have exploited Cluster and ground-based\nobservations of the cusp region in order to investigate the\nreconnection process during intervals of southward directed\nIMF. For example, on 17 March 2001, between 05:05 and\n06:50 UT, the Cluster spacecraft crossed the high-altitude\nnorthern cusp while the SuperDARN radars measured line-\nof-sight velocities typical of cusp echoes in the conjugate\nionosphere (Marchaudon et al., 2004b). This allowed for\nan investigation of the relationship between spacecraft ob-\nservations reminiscent of flux transfer events (FTE) (Russell\n2140 O.

The Cluster CIS velocity has been av-\neraged over 1 min and projected along the beam 14 of Hankasalmi.\nThe SuperDARN velocity is the radial velocity measured at the\nCluster footprint. (From Marchaudon et al., 2004a,b.)\nand Elphic, 1978; 1979) and corresponding flow bursts in\nthe ionosphere. The Cluster spacecraft were at a separation\ndistance of 600 km and crossed the conjugate SuperDARN\nfields-of-view in the pre-noon sector at 11:30 MLT. Mea-\nsurements of the local ion population indicated that the satel-\nlites were located in the high altitude cusp. Moreover, the\nlocation and energy-time dispersion of observed ion injec-\ntion structures were characteristic of a northward IMF cusp,\nentirely consistent with the prevailing IMF conditions at the\ntime. A transition of the IMF direction from north-duskward\nto south-dawnward and back to northward-duskward coin-\ncided with observations of a reversal of the convection flow\nat Cluster from dawnward to duskward and back to dawn-\nward. This reconfiguration was consistent with the observa-\ntions and models of Northern Hemisphere westward flow for\npositive BY and eastward for negative BY (Reiff and Burch,\n1985; Cowley et al., 1991). The ionospheric radars observed\na simultaneous change in ionospheric convection from dawn-\nward to duskward and back to dawnward again.\nMarchaudon et al. (2004b) went on to conduct a detailed\ncomparison of the convection velocities measured in the\nionosphere and in the high-altitude cusp. As presented in\nFig. 4, the Cluster CIS ion perpendicular velocities (Fig. 4a)\nwere mapped down into the ionosphere (Fig. 4b) and the sim-\nilarity with the radar-determined convection directions was\nfound to be quite excellent (Figs. 4c and d). Furthermore,\nduring the duskward convection interval, the phase veloc-\nity of plasma structures could be deduced from the Cluster\n4-point measurements. Bipolar structures in the perpendic-\nular magnetic field component identified these as plasma in-\njections and FTEs (Russell and Elphic, 1978). In the con-\njugate ionosphere, embedded duskward moving flow bursts\nwere simultaneously observed by one of the SuperDARN\nradars. The phase velocities determined at the Cluster alti-\ntude were mapped into the ionosphere, compared with the\nflow burst phase velocities measured by the radar, and an ex-\ncellent agreement was demonstrated once again. The authors\nhave therefore demonstrated that during a brief interval of\nsouthward-dawnward pointing IMF, the sporadic particle in-\njections at Cluster and transient flow bursts in the ionosphere\nwere both related signatures of pulsed reconnection at the\ndawn flank of the magnetopause.\nEmploying data from Cluster, Polar, and SuperDARN,\nMaynard et al. (2003) investigated the signatures of tempo-\nrally varying magnetic reconnection at the high-latitude mag-\nnetopause. This study drew upon observations from multi-\nple case studies, but showcased data recorded on 12 March\n2001, at which time the IMF clock angle was 140\u25e6. Field\nand particle measurements made by Polar whilst skimming\nthe nose of the magnetosphere at 11:45 UT revealed accel-\nerated ions and wave Poynting flux consistent with magnetic\nreconnection at a location northward of the spacecraft - dis-\nplaced significantly from the subsolar magnetopause. A short\ntime later (12:10 UT), the Cluster quartet was traversing the\nNorthern Hemisphere cusp and revealed similar signatures\nof time-varying reconnection, although in the case of Clus-\nter, the reconnection site was inferred to lie southward of the\nspacecraft.\nWhilst the Polar spacecraft observed the field and plasma\ncorresponding to the exhaust on the southward side of the\nreconnection site, the satellite\u2019s expected footprint in the\nNorthern Hemisphere ionosphere was located within the di-\nagnostic volume of the SuperDARN radar network. The Su-\nperDARN \u201cmap-potential\u201d technique (Sect. 2.2) revealed a\nseries of flow bursts in the high-latitude (75\u25e6), post-noon\nsector (13:30 MLT) ionosphere. By examining the timing\nof peak velocities within these flow bursts in the vicinity of\nthe footprint, and then comparing these with the reconnec-\ntion signatures observed by Polar in the vicinity of the sub-\nsolar magnetopause, Maynard and co-workers demonstrated\nthe ability to monitor both exhaust regions of high-latitude\nO. Amm et al.: Coordinated Cluster and ground-based studies 2141\nreconnection. Furthermore, the SuperDARN observations\nindicated that temporal fluctuations in the reconnection rate\ncontinued for over one hour, an inference to which the in-situ\nPolar observations were unable to contribute due to the in-\ncreasing separation of the spacecraft from the magnetopause.\nThe signatures of reconnection observed later in the inter-\nval by Cluster, whilst not contemporaneous with those from\nPolar, were in excellent correspondence with the continuing\nSuperDARN observations. As indicated in Fig. 5, they re-\nveal variations within the peak ionospheric flow velocity in\nthe vicinity of the spacecraft footprints. This summary of the\nSuperDARN measurements clearly demonstrates the corre-\nspondence between enhancements of reconnection observed\nby Polar and Cluster (indicated by red and blue dots, respec-\ntively) and enhancements in the ionospheric convection in\nthe conjugate ionosphere.\nThe multi-spacecraft measurements were furthermore able\nto reveal the temporal nature of the reconnection signatures,\nwhich comprised enhanced fluxes of ions and wave Poynting\nflux originating southward of the Cluster spacecraft and cusp.\nAn estimate of the current density over the Cluster tetrahe-\ndron using the Curlometer technique (Dunlop et al., 2002a,b)\nindicated that the structures were generally associated with\ntailward and northward directed current. Drawing upon ob-\nservations from a catalogue of 14 reconnection events (in-\ncluding those observed during the 12 March 2001 inter-\nval), the authors examined the occurrence of high-latitude re-\nconnection using the simultaneous detection of field-aligned\nwave Poynting flux and accelerated ions as the primary re-\nmote indicators of reconnection. The in-situ data were com-\npared with SuperDARN and MHD simulations, which led to\nthe suggestion that reconnection frequently occurs preferen-\ntially at high latitudes, especially when the IMF clock angle\nis <150\u25e6.\nIn another investigation of high latitude reconnection dur-\ning southward IMF, Farrugia et al. (2004) exploited Clus-\nter\u2019s unusual trajectory through the exterior cusp on 21 Jan-\nuary 2001, in order to examine the characteristic signatures\nof transient reconnection in the region tailward of the cusp.\nDuring the interval of interest (15:30\u201316:00 UT), Cluster was\nmoving on an outbound trajectory through the cusp pole-\nward boundary region at an altitude of 11RE in the mid-\nafternoon sector (15:20 MLT). Cluster 1 CIS observations\nindicated fast tailward and northward flow bursts of the order\nof 220 km s\u22121 (a substantial fraction of the solar wind veloc-\nity) recurring every 2\u20135 min. A comparison of the magnetic\nfield and plasma measurements indicated that the flow bursts\nwere Alfve\u00b4nic waves carrying field-aligned current into the\nionosphere, thus mediating momentum transfer along re-\ncently reconnected magnetic field lines. At much lower alti-\ntudes (1000 km), the FAST spacecraft (Carlson et al., 1998)\nwas traversing from south to north the region of the topside\nionosphere magnetically conjugate to Cluster. The observed\nstepped cusp ion precipitation was interpreted as further ev-\nidence of the temporal changes in the reconnection rate that\nalso gave rise to the pulsed flows observed at Cluster.\nThe Northern Hemisphere magnetic footprint of the Clus-\nFig. 5. Variations in the peak ionospheric flow velocity in the region\n70\u201378 Mlat between 12:00\u201315:00 MLT and 11:00\u201313:00 UT on 12\nMarch 2001. This region contained the estimated footprints of Clus-\nter and Polar. The black trace indicates the overall peak ionospheric\nvelocity while the blue and red traces present the northward and\nwestward components, respectively. The lower panels indicated the\nlatitudinal and MLT location of the peak flow velocity, colour-coded\naccording to the scale. (From Maynard et al., 2003.)\nter 1 and FAST spacecraft during this time was located in\nthe mid-afternoon sector, in close proximity to the Sondre\nStromfjord incoherent scatter radar and within the fields-\nof-view of the Iceland West and Kapuskasing SuperDARN\nradars. Using data from eight of the Northern Hemisphere\nradars, the SuperDARN \u201cmap-potential\u201d technique indicated\nthat the Cluster footprint was located slightly westward of\nthe dayside ionospheric convection throat in a region of high\nspeed (1000 m\u22121) anti-sunward flow. Detailed examina-\ntion of the SuperDARN line-of-sight velocity measurements\nin the vicinity of Cluster\u2019s footprint revealed a pulsing of\nthe ionospheric flow into the polar cap, typical of the clas-\nsic poleward-moving radar auroral forms\/pulsed ionospheric\nflows (PMRAFs\/PIFs) generally accepted as the ionospheric\nsignatures of flux transfer events. As in previous studies\n(e.g. Wild et al., 2001), a one-to-one correlation between\n2142 O. Amm et al.: Coordinated Cluster and ground-based studies\nthe PMRAFs\/PIFs observed in the SuperDARN data and the\npulsed flows observed by Cluster (during the interval be-\ntween the outermost pair of vertical lines) was not observed,\nsupporting the notion that a magnetospheric flow burst with\na repetition rate of less than a few minutes exerts a more gen-\neral \u201cstirring\u201d effect on the magnetospheric plasma at the foot\nof the open field line. However, comparison of the FAST and\nSuperDARN data demonstrated, for the first time, an excel-\nlent correspondence between two individual cusp ion steps\nand two ionospheric convection events (PMRAFs), lending\nweight to the interpretation of cusp ion steps as evidence of\ntemporal (e.g. Cowley et al., 1991), rather than spatial (e.g.\nTrattner et al., 1999) structuring of the cusp. Comparison\nof the FAST and Sondrestrom observations also clearly indi-\ncated that the open\/closed magnetic field line boundary was\nlocated 1\u20132\u25e6 equatorward of the dayside convection rever-\nsal boundary. Farrugia et al. (2004) re-emphasise the im-\nportance of the high latitude boundary region located pole-\nward of the cusps as an active site of momentum transfer,\neven during intervals of southward IMF a concept champi-\noned by Haerendel et al. (1978) in one of the earliest studies\nof magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling, but often overlooked\nin intervening years.\nFinally, in a study showcasing the full-spectrum of\nground-based instrumentation and techniques, Lockwood et\nal. (2001a) reported a series of observations made during the\ninterval 08:00 to 09:30 UT on 14 January 2001. Observa-\ntions from the EISCAT Svalbard Radar (ESR) and DMSP-\nF12 satellite were compared, during an interval of predom-\ninantly southward IMF. The Cluster spacecraft were mov-\ning from the tail lobe through the dusk sector mantle, their\nfootprints displaced from the location of the ESR by \u223c4 h\nof MLT. However, both Cluster and ESR observed strikingly\nsimilar signatures, corresponding to enhancements of elec-\ntron concentration (in the case of the ESR) and changes in\nelectron flux, ion flux and spacecraft potential (in the case of\nCluster). Data from the 32-m antenna of the ESR, which was\npointed towards magnetic north at low elevation, shows that\nthese events were poleward-moving regions of high density\nplasma, often classed as \u201cpolar cap patches\u201d, with an appar-\nent repetition period of the order of 10 min.\nAn overpass of DMSP-F12 showed dispersed energy sig-\nnatures in both the ion and electron populations, suggesting\nthe presence of pulsed reconnection (e.g. Newell and Meng,\n1991), a conclusion supported by measurements of iono-\nspheric flow by the SuperDARN radars. The derived convec-\ntion patterns indicated that these events observed by the ESR\nshould also pass over the predicted footprint of the Cluster\nsatellites. The Cluster spacecraft observed enhancements in\nelectron and ion flux, and variations in spacecraft potential,\nwhich were not only essentially identical at all satellites (sep-\naration 600 km) but also very similar to the events observed\nby the ESR (as shown in Fig. 6). The similarity was partic-\nularly marked in variations of the high-altitude electron den-\nsity observed at the ESR and the low energy magnetosheath\nelectrons measured by the PEACE instruments on Cluster.\nThe correlation between the ESR and Cluster observations\nFig. 6. From top to bottom: (a) electron density measurements\nmade using the ESR field-aligned antenna, (b) spacecraft potential\nmeasurements from the EFW instrument on all four Cluster space-\ncraft, (c) electron measurements from the HEEA detector of the\nPEACE instrument on Cluster 3, (d) electron measurements from\nthe LEEA detector of the same instrument and (e) ion measurements\nfrom the CIS instrument on Cluster 3. The ESR measurements have\nbeen time-shifted to give the best agreement with the Cluster obser-\nvations at events 5 and 11. (From Lockwood et al., 2001a.)\nsuggested that the patches were related to changes in flux in\nthe softest electrons and hence arose due to modulations in\nthe precipitation of magnetosheath electrons (Watermann et\nal., 1994). One possibility is that such modulations could\nbe caused by density variations in the source magnetosheath\nplasma, in which case they would be present whether the re-\nconnection was steady or pulsed, although the dispersed ion\nand electron signatures measured by DMSP strongly suggest\nthe influence of pulsed reconnection, with some of the events\nseen in the DMSP data clearly corresponding to the ESR\nobservations. However, modulations of low-energy mag-\nnetosheath plasma might be expected during pulsed recon-\nnection, since the location at which reconnected field lines\nthread the magnetopause evolves with time elapsed since\nreconnection, and the characteristics of the magnetosheath\npopulation might be very different near the sub-solar point\n(corresponding to newly-reconnected field lines) from that at\nhigh latitudes (corresponding to field lines reconnected for\na longer period). The correspondence between the ESR and\nCluster observations therefore suggests that the mechanism\nO. Amm et al.: Coordinated Cluster and ground-based studies 2143\ngoverning the soft particle flux is more complex than a sim-\nple dependence on the elapsed time since reconnection.\n3.3 Dayside reconnection under northward IMF\nIn comparison to the southward IMF scenario, the configu-\nration and dynamics of the magnetosphere during periods of\nnorthward IMF is less well understood. It is generally ac-\ncepted that the reconnection process does not cease entirely,\nalthough the reconnection rate is almost certainly reduced.\nHowever, it seems likely that the reconnection site is dis-\nplaced from the low- to high-latitude magnetopause, where\nlarge magnetic shears develop between the IMF and the field\nlines, within the magnetospheric lobes. Whilst \u201clobe recon-\nnection\u201d does not increase the amount of open flux in the\nsystem (indeed it may close pairs of already open field lines,\nleading to an overall decrease of open flux), the rapid recon-\nfiguration of newly-reconnected field lines results in magne-\ntospheric and ionospheric convection patterns in contrast to\nthose expected for southward IMF.\nOn 14 January 2001, the same day studied by Lockwood\net al. (2001a) as reported in the previous section, the IMF\nBZ observed by ACE turned northward at around 09:45 UT,\ncorresponding to a time of 11:00 UT at which the north-\nward turning impinged on the high-latitude magnetosphere.\nThereafter, BZ remained northward for at least four hours,\nthough with occasional intervals of intermediate clock an-\ngle. During this period, a superb collection of Cluster and\nground-based data were obtained, due to the large number of\nobserving systems in operation, making this one of the most\nimportant intervals for Cluster studies of the cusp and mag-\nnetopause under northward IMF conditions.\nLockwood et al. (2001b) reported observations made in\nthe interval 11:00 to 13:00 UT, a time when Cluster space-\ncraft were moving toward the dayside magnetopause, passing\nthrough the interior boundary of the magnetic cusp, and mov-\ning toward the exterior cusp boundary. Their study focused\non a number of intervals in which data from the CIS and\nPEACE instruments suggested that Cluster made brief ex-\ncursions into the low-latitude boundary layer (LLBL). These\nLLBL events were marked by the appearance of low-energy\nmagnetosheath ions and electrons, and the complete or par-\ntial disappearance of energetic magnetospheric electrons,\nthough not of the magnetospheric ions. The Cluster data\nand the corresponding ESR observations are shown in Fig. 7.\nAppropriately lagged measurements by ACE show that these\nperiods coincided with transient swings in the IMF clock an-\ngle from northward pointing to values near 90\u25e6. This sug-\ngested that the LLBL incursions could be explained as the ef-\nfect of reconnection pulses. Further evidence to support this\nhypothesis was provided by ground-based auroral measure-\nments, which showed an erosion of the cusp aurora to lower\nlatitudes during these events, and by data from the EISCAT\nSvalbard Radar, which showed poleward-moving transients\nat the same times.\nAlthough the Cluster data during these periods showed\nsome of the characteristics expected of Flux Transfer Events,\nFig. 7. The transient events seen by Cluster and the EISCAT Sval-\nbard Radar on 14 January 2001. From the top: (a) electron den-\nsity observed along the northward-looking beam of the ESR, with\nblack lines marking poleward moving events, (b) electron density\nobserved along the field-aligned ESR beam, (c) energy-time spec-\ntrogram of ion differential flux as observed by the CIS instrument\non Cluster 3 and (d) energy-time spectrogram of electron count rate\nobserved by the HEEA detector of the PEACE instrument on Clus-\nter 3. The numbering scheme for events in the top panel corresponds\nto that in Fig. 6. The mauve and green arrows represent the times\nof closest conjunction of the ESR with Cluster and DMSP-F15, re-\nspectively. (From Lockwood et al., 2001b.)\nthey did not exhibit classical FTE signatures. Notably lack-\ning, at least in the earliest events, was the bipolar magnetic\nsignature which is a well-known attribute of FTE events (e.g.\nRussell and Elphic, 1978, 1979) and arises from an excess of\nmagnetic pressure at their core. Lockwood et al. (2001b) sug-\ngested that the observed signatures nonetheless corresponded\nto FTEs, using the Cluster field and particle data to show that\nthe plasma was close to being in pressure equilibrium, such\nthat no bipolar signature would be expected. The lack of\nthe bipolar signature was suggested to be due to the loca-\ntion of these LLBL events, which occurred on the interior\nedge of the cusp. The latest LLBL events in the series were\nobserved as Cluster neared the exterior cusp boundary, and\nfor these events it seemed that the bipolar magnetic signature\nhad begun to appear. The earliest observations in the series\n(i.e. those in the interior cusp) were therefore interpreted as\nbeing the first observations of FTEs at middle altitudes. Fur-\nthermore, the observations were interpreted as being strongly\nsupportive of the theory that the LLBL lies on open magnetic\nfield lines, as suggested by a number of previous studies (e.g.\n(Onsager, 1994; Fuselier et al., 1991, 1992). Only an open\nmagnetic topology could explain all aspects of the reported\nobservations.\nA study by Moen et al. (2001) addressed the same\n2144 O. Amm et al.: Coordinated Cluster and ground-based studies\nsequence of events during the outbound pass of Cluster\nthrough the high-latitude lobe, cusp, magnetosheath and\nmagnetopause between 12:30 and 15:30 UT on 14 January\n2001. In their study, the key data set (in addition to the Clus-\nter data) was a series of auroral images at 630.0 nm, obtained\nusing an all-sky imager at Ny A\u02dalesund, Svalbard, concentrat-\ning in particular on two events. The two events spanned the\nintervals from 12:52\u201312:56 UT, and 13:27\u201313:57 UT, dur-\ning which Cluster had brief encounters with regions charac-\nterised by low-energy electrons and where the high energy\nelectron component was almost entirely absent. Analysis of\nthe spacecraft potential data confirmed that these intervals\ncorresponded to boundary crossings. The first interval was\ninterpreted as an encounter with the closed LLBL, caused\nby an inward bulge of the boundary layer, due to a bound-\nary layer wave propagating tailward over the satellites. This\nwas the same event which Lockwood et al. (2001b) had in-\nterpreted as being due to a Flux Transfer Event observed in\nthe interior cusp. Moen et al. (2001) interpreted the second\nevent as a crossing of the outer cusp.\nIn both events, the ground-based imager data showed an\nintensification of the 630.0-nm emission, with red-line au-\nrora expanding eastwards towards Svalbard (as illustrated in\nFig. 8). The entry and exit times of Cluster into the bound-\nary layer population corresponded well to the times that the\nred-line aurora expanded over the magnetic footprint of the\nspacecraft. In the second event (the cusp crossing), this east-\nward expansion was consistent with the transient reconfigu-\nration of the cusp and convection pattern, following a change\nin IMF clock angle from strongly northward to westward, a\nsituation which would favour reconnection on the dusk flank.\nThe auroral emission at this time showed poleward-moving\nforms, characteristic of FTEs. The first event, however, oc-\ncurred when the cusp was in the pre-noon sector, and Moen\net al. (2001) ascribed it to an encounter with closed LLBL\nfield lines on a sunward-convecting flow. When discussed\nin terms of the categories defined by Sandholt et al. (1998),\nthe auroral signatures in the second event were identified as\nsimilar to \u201cType 7\u201d, believed to originate from the dusk sec-\ntor Boundary Plasma Sheet. The data, however, supported\nthe interpretation that these emissions corresponded to cusp\nauroral activity at a surprisingly late local time, with accel-\nerated electron beams and discrete aurora occurring on open\nfield lines.\nOpgenoorth et al. (2001) focused on the interval between\n13:00 and 14:00 UT on 14 January 2001, and thus includes\nthe second event studied by Moen et al. (2001). Opgenoorth\net al. (2001) demonstrated that a dramatic re-organisation\nof the high-latitude convection pattern and current systems\noccurred, due to a change in the direction of the IMF. A\nflow channel, directed eastward and poleward, appeared over\nCanada and expanded (also eastward and poleward) toward\nSvalbard. At the same time, the four Cluster spacecraft and\ntheir magnetic footprint, in the viewing area of the Son-\ndre Stromfjord radar, were engulfed by cusp-like precipi-\ntation with transient magnetic and electric field signatures.\nThe ESR observed poleward-moving transients and fast flow\nFig. 8.

Emission intensity is\ncolour-coded on a linear scale from blue to red. The red and yellow\ncurves in the upper images represent the nominal ground-track of\nCluster calculated for two different lags (75 and 60 min) of the IMF\nobservations. The straight red line west of Svalbard in the lower\nimages represents the flight path of NOAA-12. The images show a\nprogressive eastward expansion of the red line aurora toward Sval-\nbard, consistent with the reconfiguration of the convection pattern\nreported by Opgenoorth et al. (2001). (From Moen et al., 2001.)\nchannels associated with auroral structures which formed\nto the west and north of the radar. The ground-based data\nshowed that the cusp region had moved from its normal pre-\nnoon location to extend far into the dusk sector, allowing for\nthe first, quite unexpected, encounter of the Cluster space-\ncraft with the cusp. This confirmed the interpretation of\nMoen et al. (2001) that the observations corresponded to a\ncrossing of the cusp.\nSuperDARN, magnetometer, EISCAT and satellite re-\nsults, synthesised together using the AMIE technique (see\nSect. 2.2), showed that a pre-existing two-cell convection\npattern, with no evidence of lobe reconnection, evolved into\na very distorted pattern following the appearance of a strong\nchannel of northeast directed flow, which formed a narrow\nextension of the dusk cell. This distorted pattern persisted for\nsome 15 min, during the time that Cluster observed the cusp-\nlike features, before returning to its previous orientation. Ex-\namination of the data from individual radars, magnetometer\nO. Amm et al.: Coordinated Cluster and ground-based studies 2145\nnetworks and optical instruments strikingly confirmed the\ndetails of this overall picture.\nThe Cluster data showed a remarkable correspondence\nwith the features observed by the ground-based instruments,\nsuggesting that Cluster encountered the same structures of\nprecipitation and convection as were observed at the lati-\ntude of Svalbard. The drop-out of the energetic particles\nin the Cluster data occurred at the time when the eastward\nflow channel arrived at the Cluster footprint (as indicated\nin Fig. 9). Consideration of the data from all four Cluster\nspacecraft revealed that the encounter with the low energy\nplasma was characterised by features in electric field, mag-\nnetic field and plasma density, all of which passed over the\nspacecraft in the same order, allowing a vector velocity to\nbe determined for the propagation of the transient which was\nconsistent with the ground-based observations. The Cluster\nparticle data were all explicable in terms of an encounter with\nthe exterior cusp, and this was confirmed by DMSP data from\naround the same time. The only feature inconsistent with a\ncusp passage was an increase in the magnetic field strength.\nThe observations were interpreted as being caused by the\nonset of sub-solar reconnection around 13:20 UT. This was\nduring a period of BZ north, but with a clock angle greater\nthan 45\u25e6, conditions under which Lockwood et al. (2000)\nand McCrea at al. (2000) have shown that sub-solar and lobe\nreconnection can exist simultaneously. The flow channels\ncould thus be understood as arising due to the tension force\non newly-reconnected field lines, and would be consistent\nwith the global magnetometer results. The precursor elec-\ntric field events seen in connection to the main flow channel\ncould have been due to the ionospheric return flows asso-\nciated with FTEs, and the fact that corresponding magnetic\nsignatures were not observed might be due to the propen-\nsity for field-aligned current sheets to form closed magnetic\nstructures. The overall situation, in which the dayside mag-\nnetosphere was deformed by strong field-aligned currents as-\nsociated with a flow channel, is probably unusual, though the\ncurrent understanding of cusp dynamics is not good enough\nto make this claim too strongly. The extent of the flow chan-\nnel (5 h in MLT) certainly appeared surprising when com-\npared to previous observations, particularly for such moder-\nate conditions.\nIn a very fortunate coincidence on 18 March 2002, the\nCluster spacecraft crossed the magnetopause at the same time\nas the IMAGE-FUV instrument observed a bright proton au-\nrora spot in the ionosphere (Phan et al., 2003). Previous in-\nvestigations have confirmed that such a proton aurora spot\noccurs during northward IMF conditions (Frey et al., 2002\nFuselier et al., 2002). The strong relationship between the\nlocation in local time and the IMF BY component has sug-\ngested that the proton aurora spot is the manifestation of\nmagnetopause reconnection, and the direct entry and pre-\ncipitation of solar wind particles. On this day, the Clus-\nter spacecraft crossed the magnetopause between 14:54:52\u2013\n15:03:52 UT. The crossing occurred tailward of the cusp and\nwas recognized by the 175\u25e6 rotation of the magnetic field\nfrom the lobe to the magnetosheath orientation. Plasma jets\nFig. 9. Stacked plot showing the electron density observed along\nthe northward-looking beam of the ESR (top panel), total ion flux\nfrom the CIS instrument on the Cluster 3 spacecraft (middle panel)\nand magnetic X-disturbance along the central meridian of the Scan-\ndinavian IMAGE magnetometer network (lower panel). The thin\narrows show the relationship of features in the CIS data to regions\nof eastward (red) and westward (green) current flow as observed\nby the magnetometer network. The heavier black bars illustrate the\npossible continued polar propagation of these features towards the\nsouthernmost latitudes observed by the ESR. (From Opgenoorth et\nal., 2001.)\nwith flow enhancements were observed, first anti-sunward\nand then sunward, indicating the passage of a reconnection\nX-line across the spacecraft. A Wale\u00b4n test was performed\n(Sonnerup et al., 1987), resulting in the determination of a\ngood deHoffman-Teller frame and a flow velocity of 90% of\nthe Alfve\u00b4n velocity, confirming the occurrence of reconnec-\ntion close to the spacecraft. With a small spacecraft sepa-\nration of only 100 km the magnetopause structures appeared\nalmost identically in the spin resolution data of all spacecraft.\nFollowing a strong increase in solar wind dynamic pressure\nat around 13:22 UT, the FUV instrument observed a strong\nproton aurora spot in the dayside ionosphere for more than\n4 h (Frey et al., 2003b). As the Cluster spacecraft passed\noverhead, their position could be mapped down into the iono-\nsphere (as presented in Fig. 10), confirming the direct con-\nnection between the reconnection signatures in the magne-\ntopause and the occurrence of the bright proton aurora spot\nat the geomagnetic footprint. Furthermore, estimates of the\nauroral brightness based upon the energy and flux of pro-\ntons in the jets encountered by Cluster, matched the IMAGE\n2146 O.

Having demonstrated the connection between\nthe high-altitude and the ionospheric observations, Phan and\nco-workers attempted to map the proton spot out into the\nmagnetosphere. First, the measured and modelled magnetic\nfield magnitudes and strengths were brought into correspon-\ndence (Phan et al., 2003). The extent of the reconnection\nX-line could then be estimated from the ionospheric size of\nthe proton spot to be at least 3.6RE . As such, the combina-\ntion of the Cluster measurements with remotely-sensed ob-\nservations allowed the confirmation of a direct relationship\nbetween magnetopause reconnection and the occurrence of\nthe proton aurora spot, and an estimate of the reconnection\nsite size which would have been impossible from only the\nin-situ measurements.\nFinally, a study by Pitout et al. (2001) used data from the\nEISCAT Svalbard Radar, DMSP-F13 and the Cluster satel-\nlites, on 2 February 2001, to study the dynamics of the cusp\nregion during an interval in which BZ was generally north-\nward, and signatures of lobe reconnection predominated.\nSome of the interval also corresponded to conditions of\nsouthward IMF, when poleward flows and strong poleward-\nmoving transients were observed by the northward-looking\nbeam of the ESR. During the interval of BZ north, which\ncorresponded to the closest conjunction of Cluster with the\ncusp, the ESR showed low densities and temperatures, and\na sunward flow at low velocity. The Cluster and DMSP\ndata supported the interpretation that Cluster passed through\nthe northernmost boundary of the cusp region, observing\nhighly structured plasma characterised by reversed disper-\nsion, due to ion injections caused by pulsed lobe reconnec-\ntion. However, it did not appear that the events observed\nby the ESR were the same as those seen by Cluster. This\ncould be explained by the inference that the height at which\nthe northward-looking beam of the ESR intersected the cusp\nionosphere (\u223c300 km) was too high to observe the signatures\nof the precipitating ions detected by Cluster. Furthermore, a\nvery close correspondence was noted between the IMF BZ\nmeasured by ACE and the meridional plasma flow measured\nby the ESR, with an anti-sunward flow for southward IMF\nand a sunward flow for northward IMF. An interesting feature\nwas that lobe reconnection seemed to be effective here in the\nwinter magnetosphere at relatively small values of northward\nIMF, although some previous studies (e.g. Crooker and Rich,\n1993) had asserted it to be primarily a summer phenomenon.\n3.4 Reconnection signatures in the cusp\nAll too often, simple descriptions of the cusp fail to high-\nlight the truly dynamic nature of this hugely important re-\ngion. However, the organisation of fields and plasma within\nthe cusp remains uncertain. Satellites crossing the polar cusp\noften record energetically-dispersed features in ion energy\nspectra. These are a consequence of the motion of newly-\nopened magnetic field lines, produced by magnetopause re-\nconnection, convecting with the anti-sunward flowing solar\nwind. In general, the cusp structure is complex and varia-\ntions in the observed ion energy dispersion signatures are of-\nten step-like in appearance (so-called \u201ccusp ion steps\u201d). The\nquestion of whether these cusp structures are predominantly\ntemporally or spatially organised, and the associated debate\nregarding the quasi-steady or transient nature of reconnec-\ntion, remains the focus of research worldwide.\nThe most common explanation of these cusp ion steps\nis that they correspond to a temporal effect. The cusp is\npulsating under the action of a burst of enhanced magne-\ntopause reconnection, with neighbouring reconnected flux\ntubes generated by successive reconnection pulses. Open\nflux tubes have different time histories since reconnection\n(Cowley and Lockwood, 1992; Lockwood and Smith, 1994)\nand the jumps between steps correspond to the satellite en-\ncountering successive flux tubes (from successive reconnec-\ntion pulses). The flux tubes are convected with the open mag-\nnetic field under the joint action of magnetic tension and so-\nlar wind flow. This explanation is supported by ground-based\nobservations of successive PMAFs\/PMRAFs in conjunction\nwith satellite observations of these cusp ion steps (Lockwood\net al., 1995; McWilliams et al., 2001a).\nHowever, studies using combinations of two satellites sug-\ngest spatial rather than temporal structures in the cusp ion\nstructures. Examples include an investigation where Inter-\nball and Polar observed the same complicated structures 1.5 h\nafter each other (Trattner et al., 1999), or when Polar and\nFAST observed similar structures while crossing the same\nMLT region during stable solar wind conditions (Trattner et\nal., 2002). The interpretation proposed to explain such ob-\nservations is that reconnection at the magnetopause can be a\nrather constant process with only very minor changes in the\nreconnection rate. During stable IMF conditions, a steady,\nopened flux tube can be created that is spatially limited by\nthe size of the magnetopause X-line. The existence of mul-\ntiple X-lines may generate several coexisting, newly-opened\nflux tubes. The cusp ion steps observed by satellites are then\ndue to the crossing of different flux tubes in which the dis-\ntance between the open-closed field line boundary and the\nO. Amm et al.: Coordinated Cluster and ground-based studies 2147\nsatellite position is different, as indicated in Fig. 11. The\ncloser the satellite is from the open-closed field line bound-\nary, the higher the ion energy observed by the satellite due to\ntime-of-flight effects. Moreover, if IMF conditions are vari-\nable, temporal modifications of the convection pattern can\noccur and change the location of the open-closed field line\nboundary relative to the spacecraft, and hence change the\ndistance travelled by an opened flux tube to the spacecraft.\nThe variations of the distance between the open-closed field\nline boundary and the satellite position can therefore result\nin the smooth reversal of previous ion energy dispersion or\nto a sudden step within the ion energy spectrum observed at\nthe satellite.\nSpacecraft separated in altitude are generally considered\nadvantageous for cusp studies, as the different velocities of\nthe satellites would indicate whether similar observed struc-\ntures were in fact spatially or temporally organised (Trattner\net al., 2004). Since the Cluster satellites cross the cusp at\nsimilar altitudes, this advantage is lost. However, the iden-\ntical instrumentation and the time delay of up to 45 min be-\ntween consecutive cusp crossings compensated for this dis-\nadvantage in the study by Trattner et al. (2003) and allowed\nfor detailed investigation of the cusp during changing solar\nwind conditions. During the studied period on 25 July 2001,\nthe SuperDARN network was operating in a special Cluster\nsupport mode and determined the global convection pattern.\nTwo of the Cluster spacecraft crossed the cusp within 6 min\nof one another, during southward IMF conditions, and ob-\nserved very similar ion fluxes (as presented in the top and\nbottom panels of Fig. 12). Several sudden steps in the ion\nenergy-time spectra were explained by two scenarios. In one\ncase the temporal changes in the location of the convection\npattern shortens or lengthens the convection length of mag-\nnetic field lines from the open-closed field line boundary to\nthe position where they are intercepted by the satellites. The\nother is the result of a reorganization of the convection pat-\ntern. This reorganization moved the boundary between the\nconvection cells over the location of the observing Cluster\nsatellites. The entry into a different spatially separated con-\nvection cell, where the location of the ion open-closed field\nline boundary was significantly closer to the observing satel-\nlites, then resulted in the sudden step-up of the ion disper-\nsion. The results were therefore consistent with a spatial in-\nterpretation of cusp structures (Trattner et al., 2003).\nA related study investigated observations on 23 Septem-\nber 2001 when the IMF conditions were very variable, with\nchanges mostly in the IMF BZ direction (Trattner et al.,\n2004). Such varying conditions are likely to introduce tem-\nporal changes in the reconnection location, and most prob-\nably, temporal changes in the reconnection rate. Two of\nthe Cluster spacecraft observed very similar ion dispersion\nstructures while entering the cusp within one minute of each\nother. The projection of the satellite observations, together\nwith the ground-based (SuperDARN) convection observa-\ntions, revealed that these structures were probably of a tem-\nporal nature. The second spacecraft observed the same step\nfeature about 1 higher in latitude and 1 min later than the\nFig. 11. Ionospheric convection cells derived from the statistical\nelement of the SuperDARN \u201cmap potential\u201d model for \u2212BZ and\n\u2212BY IMF input, in order to illustrate how major cusp structures\ncould be spatial instead of temporal. Two flux tubes and two satel-\nlite trajectories have been superimposed on the convection cells.\n(From Trattner et al., 2004.)\nlow-latitude spacecraft, which is consistent with a tempo-\nrally varying structure as predicted by the pulsed reconnec-\ntion scenario with a varying reconnection rate. The estimated\nconvection speed of the structure at the spacecraft altitude\nwere also consistent with the convection speed measured by\nthe radar. Clearly, in this study, ground-based observations\nmade it possible to observe the ionospheric convection pat-\ntern over an extended period of time. These observations\nmade it possible to distinguish between the temporal and spa-\ntial interpretations of the in-situ measurements (even though\nthey were recorded at reduced temporal resolution). The pro-\njection of the satellite footprints onto the ionospheric convec-\ntion map ultimately revealed that changes in the ion disper-\nsions coincided with the motion of the spacecraft into differ-\nent structures of the convection pattern, in this case, different\nconvection cells.\nAnother perspective on the temporal variability of mag-\nnetic reconnection in the cusp is provided by Bosqued et\nal. (2005). A combination of 90 min of Cluster multi-point\ndata at \u223c5RE altitude and global dayside imaging data pro-\nvided by the IMAGE-SI-12 instrument was used to analyze\nthe northern cusp crossing on 14 July 2001. The IMF was\npointing southward\/strongly duskward and, for more than\n30 min, the solar wind pressure psw was highly variable and\nreached 13 nPa. Simultaneous observations in the northern\n13:00\u201314:50 MLT sector, at 71\u201375\u25e6 latitude, revealed intense\ncusp activity, characterized by multiple, impulsive energy-\ndispersed ion injections, with a recurrence time of 8\u201310 min,\nthat were perfectly correlated in space and time with an in-\ntense Ly-\u03b1 brightening. These two coupled transient signa-\ntures were one-to-one related to repeated psw enhancements\nwhich also led to an equatorward shift of the brightest UV au-\nrora and its spreading in MLT and latitude. The Ly-\u03b1 bright-\nness was positively related to psw but not to the IMF clock\nangle (Frey et al., 2002), and is remarkably similar (within a\nfactor of 2) to the expected count rate deduced from the total\nion energy flux measured by Cluster on the same field line.\n2148 O.

Cluster CIS observations for the cusp crossings on 25\nJuly 2001. Plotted are H+ omni-directional flux measurements\n(1\/cm2 s sr keV\/e) for Cluster 1, 3, and 4. All spacecraft encounter\ndistinctive structures with sudden jumps in the ion energy disper-\nsion that are similar on Cluster 1 and 4, but different on the later\narriving Cluster 3. (From Trattner et al., 2003.)\nThe authors inferred a rather steady reconnection site located\nat 10\u201312RE from Cluster, i.e. on the dusk flank of the com-\npressed magnetosphere, at around 17:00-18:00 MLT. They\ninterpreted these very dynamic and transient features as clear\nsignatures of pulsed magnetic reconnection operating in a lo-\ncalized region of the magnetopause, centred on the prefer-\nential anti-parallel merging site. The results unambiguously\nreveal that the reconnection rate at this reconnection site is\nnot spontaneously self-varying but, more evidently, directly\nmodulated by upstream dynamic pressure psw and\/or Alfve\u00b4n\nMach number perturbations. Their results show that the re-\nconnection process even during southward IMF appears to\nbe steady, with modulations caused by changes in the solar\nwind conditions.\n3.5 Summary\nCluster\u2019s multi-point measurement capability has revealed\nnew insights into the location and size of the dayside re-\nconnection region, as well as re-confirming the intrinsic link\nbetween the coupling of the interplanetary and terrestrial\nmagnetic fields at the magnetopause and plasma dynam-\nics in the high-latitude ionosphere (as observed by ground-\nbased instruments). The high-altitude trajectory of the space-\ncraft through the cusp and high-latitude magnetopause has\nresulted in measurements that have re-invigorated the dis-\ncussion of dayside reconnection at a range of latitudes and\nunder various IMF configurations. The multipoint obser-\nvations of previously-identified and new phenomena have\ngreatly improved our understanding of the highly dynamic\ndayside magnetosphere and ionosphere scrutinized by space-\nand ground-based techniques.\nFlux transfer events observed by Cluster during intervals\nof southward-oriented IMF have revealed the basic elements\nof the dayside solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere cou-\npling process. Magnetospheric flux tubes opened to inter-\nplanetary space by magnetic reconnection with the IMF at\nthe dayside magnetopause (i.e. FTEs) have been conclusively\nlinked to transient signatures observed in the ionospheric\nfootprints of the cusps. In particular, the flux tube motion\nand inter-FTE period has been demonstrated to be the same\nwhen observed in the magnetosphere by Cluster or in the\nionosphere by ground-based instruments. Inter-hemispheric,\nground-based measurements have also revealed that mag-\nnetic reconnection can occur over an azimuthally extended\nreconnection X-line spanning several hours of MLT.\nDuring intervals when the IMF is oriented southward,\nbut with a significant dawn-dusk component, coordinated\nCluster\/ground-based investigations have provided com-\npelling evidence that the coupling between the interplane-\ntary and magnetospheric magnetic fields can take place far\nfrom the low-latitude subsolar region. Several studies have\ndemonstrated that dayside magnetic reconnection can be sus-\ntained in the high-latitude region tailward of the cusp.\nRemotely-sensed measurements during intervals of north-\nward IMF have proven invaluable to the interpretation of the\ncomplex multi-spacecraft Cluster data. Space-based obser-\nvations of the proton aurora during a sustained interval of\nnorthward IMF indicated that a reconnection line (3.6RE in\nlength) located tailward of the cusp and traversed by Cluster\nremained active over several hours. In another case, clear ev-\nidence of pulsed dayside reconnection observed in the iono-\nspheric footprint of the cusp suggested that the in-situ signa-\ntures of FTEs observed by Cluster in the mid-altitude cusp\ndiffer from those often observed at higher altitudes in the\nvicinity of the magnetopause. Evidence has also been pre-\nsented contradicting the view that under northward IMF con-\nditions, magnetospheric and ionospheric dynamics are gener-\nally weaker than during intervals of southward IMF. Indeed,\nthe first ever encounter of the Cluster spacecraft with the\nmagnetospheric cusp occurred during an interval of north-\nward IMF. Ground-based data clearly indicated a dramatic\nand unexpected reconfiguration of the high-latitude convec-\ntion pattern as the cusp extended far into the dusk sector.\nFinally, Cluster and ground-based observations have con-\ntributed to the active debate regarding the temporal\/spatial\nnature of dayside reconnection signatures in cusp. The multi-\npoint nature of the Cluster measurements might have re-\nsolved this discussion conclusively. However, based upon\nthe Cluster data reviewed in this paper, there is compelling\nevidence (supported by ground-based data) for both the spa-\ntial and temporal interpretations of reconnection signatures\nin the cusp.\nTherefore, while numerous new results have emerged from\nthe first few years of the Cluster mission, several key areas\nare still not fully understood. Indeed, many new questions\nhave arisen. These include:\n\u2013 Is magnetic reconnection at the dayside magnetopause\npredominantly steady or bursty, or is this a function of\nsome external influence (i.e. IMF configuration)?\nO. Amm et al.: Coordinated Cluster and ground-based studies 2149\n\u2013 With the tetrahedron configuration of Cluster, is it pos-\nsible to measure the electrodynamics of an FTE, espe-\ncially the distribution of the field-aligned currents (with\nthe Cluster curlometer) and the ionospheric closure of\nthe currents (with ground-based observations)?\n\u2013 How significant is dayside reconnection tailward of the\ncusp in terms of the creation\/destruction of open mag-\nnetic flux, as inferred from ground-based techniques\nbased on observations of the changing polar cap size?\n(i.e. does magnetic reconnection under northward IMF\nactually create open magnetic flux tubes)?\n\u2013 Is there in-situ evidence of sunward-moving open flux\ntubes during intervals of northward IMF, corresponding\nto sunward ionospheric convection within the polar cap?\n\u2013 Can multi-point, in-situ measurements reveal the size\nof the dayside reconnection X-line line? Furthermore,\nhow does this compare to the \u201cmerging gap\u201d in the iono-\nspheric convection pattern derived from ground-based\nmeasurements?\nIt is anticipated that the increased use of significantly larger\nspacecraft separations in the future, the provision of addi-\ntional data from the Double Star pair of spacecraft, and the\ncontinuing expansion in coverage of ground-based instru-\nments (in both hemispheres) will contribute to the resolution\nof many such issues.\n4 Nightside processes\n4.1 Introduction\nThe nightside processes can be ascribed to the interaction be-\ntween the solar wind and the magnetosphere-ionosphere sys-\ntem, like the dayside processes. Unlike the dayside, however,\nthe magnetospheric field is not compressed due to the solar\nwind, but rather stretched out into a long magnetotail. There\nare mainly two processes governing the global dynamics of\nthe nightside magnetosphere and the ionosphere: convection\nand substorms. The strongest driving mechanism of the con-\nvection is the reconnection of the field lines between the solar\nwind and the magnetosphere. When the IMF is southward,\nthe reconnected field lines at the dayside are transported to-\nward the nighside, reconnected at the distant tail, and then\ntransported back toward the dayside, creating inward and\nan earthward flow in the plasma sheet and causing the two-\ncell flow-current pattern in the ionosphere. When the flux\nmerging rate at the dayside is larger than at the nightside,\nthe magnetic field energy becomes stored in the magneto-\ntail and is released in an explosive way during a substorm.\nA variety of signatures involving both the ionosphere and\nmagnetosphere take place: particle acceleration and precipi-\ntation, fast plasma flows, enhanced field-aligned currents and\nionospheric electrojets. Furthermore, disturbances take place\non different spatial scales. For example, convection in the\nmagnetosphere actually consists of transient, localized high\nspeed flows, called bursty bulk flow (BBF), and slow back-\nground flows. Reconnection involves processes from MHD\nscales (1 to 10RE) down to the electron kinetic scales (0.5\nto 5 km). The widths of auroral arcs can range from 100 km\nto 100 m. The multi-scale properties and the interaction be-\ntween the ionosphere and the magnetosphere make nightside\nprocesses very complicated. In the following sections we re-\nview recent studies which have combined the results of Clus-\nter multi-point observations and the ground-based observa-\ntions to study: (1) Large-scale convection and boundaries,\n(2) Substorms, (3) Fast flows, and (4) Auroral arcs.\n4.2 Large-scale convection and nightside boundaries\nThe global magnetic convection typically forms a two-cell\nconvection pattern in the ionosphere. On the dusk (dawn)\nside, the ionospheric flow is eastward (westward) at the high-\nlatitude portion and westward (eastward) in the lower lati-\ntude. The border between these two flow directions is called\nthe \u201cconvection reversal boundary (CRB)\u201d or \u201cshear flow re-\ngion\u201d. As will be discussed below new results have been ob-\ntained concerning the temporal\/spatial characteristics on the\nshear flow region and the open\/closed boundary by combin-\ning Cluster and ground-based data.\nAmm et al. (2003) analysed the mesoscale structure of\nthe early morning side ionospheric shear flow region using\ncombined data from Cluster and the MIRACLE network of\nground-based instruments in Fennoscandia. During the event\non 6 February 2002, between 23:00 and 00:00 UT, the Clus-\nter satellites were located close to their perigee at 4RE , and\ntheir magnetic footprints moved poleward, closely aligned\nwith the central chain of magnetometers of the ground net-\nwork. Because the footprints were almost linearly aligned\nalong the direction of their motion through the ionosphere, in\nthis study Cluster\u2019s multi-satellite abilities were mainly used\nto distinguish between spatial and temporal changes along\nthe close-to-meridional profile covered by the combined data\nsets.\nUsing the ground-based magnetic and ionospheric electric\nfield data, Amm et al. (2003) computed meridional profiles\nof the true ionospheric currents, conductances, and field-\naligned currents using the JEQ-based method of character-\nistics (see Sect. 2.2). Since all the ionospheric parameters\nobtained from the ground-based measurements were varying\nonly in the meridional direction, a 1-D version of the method\nof characteristics was used. From Cluster, the FACs were de-\ntermined from each satellite separately, assuming that they\nwere crossing zonally oriented current sheets.\nFigure 13 illustrates the main result of Amm et al. (2003).\nThe figure shows the FAC measured by Cluster 2 in the\nlower panel and the magnetic field immediately below the\nionosphere along meridional profiles at the central meridian\nof MIRACLE, as derived from the ground magnetometers.\nHere, positive magnetic fields correspond to eastward cur-\nrents and negative ones to westward currents. The location\nof the change of sign is marked by a green line and called the\nmagnetic convection reversal boundary (MCRB), in contrast\n2150 O. Amm et al.: Coordinated Cluster and ground-based studies\nto the CRB which is determined by ionospheric electric field\nor convection measurements. Typically, the MCRB is located\n0.5\u20131.5\u25e6 of latitude poleward of the CRB in the morning sec-\ntor (e.g. Amm et al., 2000). The pink line marks the location\nof the magnetic footprint of Cluster 2 in space and time, and\nthe blue dashed line denotes the latitude at which the satel-\nlite crosses the CRB. While a single sheet of upward FAC is\nobserved at the equatorward flank of the westward electrojet\n(region A), two sheets of downward FAC are present. One\nis caused by the equatorward gradient of conductances at the\npoleward flank of the westward electrojet (region B), and the\nother by the positive divergence of the electric field in the\nvicinity of the CRB (region C). The two downward FAC re-\ngions are separated by 0.5\u20132\u25e6 in latitude. This double FAC\nfeature is independently confirmed by the FAC derived from\nall four Cluster satellites and from the method of character-\nistics which show an excellent agreement when compared\nalong the Cluster magnetic footprint line. While the observa-\ntions of the four Cluster satellites showed some differences\naccording to the temporal variation of the current system, as\nshown in Fig. 13, the basic spatial structure of the FAC sys-\ntem remains unchanged in the results of all four satellites.\nThe open-closed field line boundary, as determined from the\nion spectrogramms of the CIS instrument, was located 3\u2013\n4\u25e6 poleward of the CRB. Therefore, the use of the CRB as\na proxy for the open-closed field-line boundary can lead to\nsignificant errors.\nThe open-closed boundary in the dawn sector was stud-\nied by Wild et al. (2004) by comparing space-born particle\nobservations including Cluster and ground-based observa-\ntions using several different techniques. The polar cap (PC)\nboundary detection techniques utilizing space-based obser-\nvations of UV aurora (Brittnacher et al., 1999) have an ad-\nvantage of obtaining the boundary at all MLT with a high\ntemporal resolution. However, studies comparing particle\ndata from low-altitude satellites have revealed that such tech-\nniques may have problems especially in the dawn sector\n(Kauristie et al., 1999; Baker et al., 2000), which partly can\nbe overcome with some statistical corrections (Carbary et al.,\n2003). SuperDARN spectral width boundaries can also be\nused as a proxy for the PC-boundary, as demonstrated by\nChisham et al. (2004), although this technique also has some\nuncertainty in the dawn sector. Wild et al. (2004) investi-\ngated these different PC-boundaries determined from the IM-\nAGE WIC and SI-13 cameras with passbands of 140\u2013180 nm\nand 130\u2013140 nm, respectively, and from the SuperDARN\ndata, and compared them with precipitation data from Clus-\nter, FAST and one of the DMSP satellites, when the satel-\nlites flew across the dawn sector auroral oval during 15:09\u2013\n16:04 UT on 8 December 2001. Figure 14 summarises the\nPC-boundary locations as determined from the particle pre-\ncipitation data and UV data. At 04:00\u201305:00 MLT the pole-\nward boundary in the IMAGE WIC image is several degrees\nequatorward from the corresponding boundary deduced from\nthe Cluster CIS and PEACE data. The PC-boundary in the\nSI-13 image is more consistent with the particle data. The\nPC-boundary proxy from SuperDARN spectral widths was\nFig. 13. (Upper panel) Magnetic field immediately below the iono-\nsphere along meridional profiles at the central meridian of MIRA-\nCLE, as derived from the ground magnetometers. Positive mag-\nnetic fields correspond to eastward currents and negative ones to\nwestward currents. The location of the change in sign is marked\nby a green line and called magnetic convection reversal boundary\n(MCRB). (lower panel) FAC measured by Cluster 2 with upward\nFAC being positive. The pink line marks the location of the mag-\nnetic footprint of Cluster 2 in space and time, and the blue dashed\nline denotes the latitude at which the satellite crosses the CRB.\n(From Amm et al., 2003.)\nlocated poleward of the most intense WIC emission. PEACE\ndata showed that the region poleward of the WIC emis-\nsion but still within SI-13 emission was occupied by very\nsoft (<5 keV) electron precipitation. The WIC poleward\nO. Amm et al.: Coordinated Cluster and ground-based studies 2151\nboundary corresponded roughly to the location where the en-\nergy flux of the hard precipitation, which dominated at lower\nlatitudes, dropped below the flux of the soft precipitation.\nThe study of Wild et al. (2004) demonstrated that at\nleast in some cases, the difficulty of estimating reliably the\nPC-location in the dawn sector can be overcome by cross-\nchecking the UV wideband (mainly LBH) observations with\nthe UV emission at shorter wavelengths (OI emission at\n<140 nm). An interesting topic for future studies is to check\nwhether the temporal variations in the particle-based and UV-\nbased PC-boundary locations are consistent with each other.\nThis issue can be studied, for example, using data from Clus-\nter near-perigee oval crossings with one satellite lagging the\nothers (or the string of pearls configuration) and simultane-\nous IMAGE WIC and SI-13 images.\n4.3 Substorm studies\nThe concept of an auroral substorm was introduced about 40\nyears ago by Akasofu (1964). The original Akasofu scenario\nincludes only the expansion and recovery phase but a few\nyears later McPherron (1970) expanded this picture to also\ninclude the growth phase. Today the auroral morphology and\ndynamics of the substorm are well known, but there are sev-\neral issues, especially in the magnetospheric processes, that\nare still under discussion. Below we review recent substorm\nstudies which utilise the multi-point observations of Cluster\nand various GB measurements.\nThe initial triggering mechanism of the substorm expan-\nsion phase onset has been and continues to be a controversial\nissue in magnetospheric research. The Near-Earth Neutral\nLine model (NENL) and the Current Disruption model (CD)\nare the most widely discussed scenarios in this context (e.g.\nBaker et al., 1996; Lui, 1996). In the NENL model, the pri-\nmary cause for the substorm expansion is reconnection which\ntakes place in the mid-tail. Reconnection causes formation\nof a tailward moving plasmoid and earthward-directed high\nspeed flows, which transport flux, mass and energy into the\nnear-Earth region. As a consequence, there is a disruption of\nthe near-Earth cross tail current and a build-up of the sub-\nstorm current wedge (SCW). In the CD model the initial\ncauses of the expansion are plasma instabilities developing\nin the near-Earth region at downtail distances of 6\u201310RE ,\nwhich lead to the current disruption and SCW formation.\nThe disruption front propagates tailwards and launches re-\nconnection in the mid-tail. Several Geotail statistical stud-\nies have shown that mid-tail flows are preceed by 2\u20133 min\nsubstorm-related Pi2 onset signatures (before Nagai et al.,\n1998; Machida et al., 1999) or UV auroral onsets (Miyashita\net al., 2003). Such observations have been interpreted as sup-\nporting the NENL model. Lyons (2000), however, argued\nthat in the NENL scenario that the mid-tail reconnection sig-\nnatures should appear at least 5 min before the Pi2 onset due\nto the finite propagation speeds. The difficulty in estimating\nthe transit times properly still leaves some space for discus-\nsion. Four-point observations by Cluster were proven to be\nuseful to identify X-lines and follow their motion (Runov et\nFig. 14. A schematic summary of the distribution of UV auroras and\nFAST, DMSP F13, Cluster 1 and 3 overflights on 8 December 2001.\nIn the satellite paths the transition from dashed to solid line indicates\nthe transition from open to closed field lines (PC-boundary). The\ngray silhouette shows the UV aurora distribution at 15:19:49 UT\nthe times and the PC-locations of the satellite overflights are given\nin the numbered boxes. (From Wild et al., 2004.)\nFig. 15. (Upper and middle panel) Cluster FGM and CIS observa-\ntions of the BZ , GSM and ion earthward and tailward flows, (Lower\npanel) GOES magnetic field data for the parallel (Hp green), earth-\nward (He, red) and normal (Hn, black) components recorded dur-\ning a substorm on 27 August 2001. (From Baker et al. 2002.)\nal., 2003) and to probe in detail the injection front (Baker et\nal., 2002a). Therefore, Cluster can provide additional infor-\nmation in such substorm studies, i.e. the propagation direc-\ntion of the disturbance.\nBaker et al. (2002b) studied an isolated substorm on 27\nAugust 2001 and demonstrated, at least in this well-observed\ncase, that simultaneous satellite observations from the mid-\ntail and near-Earth regions were consistent with the NENL\nmodel. Data from Geotail (solar wind), GOES-8 (geosta-\ntionary, at 23:00 LT), Polar (downtail at 9RE , at 02:00 LT),\nand Cluster (downtail at 19RE , at 00:30 LT) were used.\nIMAGE WIC images were used for substorm onset timing.\nThese images show several local brightenings from 02:00 UT\nto the onset of the global scale activity at 04:08 UT. Fig-\nure 15 shows magnetic field data from Cluster and GOES-\n8. The dipolarization observed by GOES-8 took place at\n2152 O. Amm et al.: Coordinated Cluster and ground-based studies\n2106 2118\nPBU Main onset\nFig. 16. The time-latitude distribution of the westward equivalent\nionospheric currents as deduced from the MIRACLE magnetome-\nter data recorded during a substorm on 8 September 2002 (From\nSergeev et al., 2005).\n04:09 UT, i.e. essentially simultaneously with the auroral on-\nset, while the plasmoid signatures (IMF Bz>0 values fol-\nlowed by Bz<0 values and tailward flow) started at Cluster\nalready at 04:01 UT. Thus, the mid-tail reconnection signa-\ntures were observed in this case 7 min prior to the near-Earth\nand auroral onsets.\nSergeev et al. (2005) also used a radial configuration of\nISTP, Cluster and LANL spacecraft to study the relationship\nof substorm growth and expansion phase phenomena in the\nnear- and mid-tail during a substorm on 8 September 2002.\nThe westward electrojet activity in the midnight sector, as de-\nduced from ground magnetometer data, is shown in Fig. 16.\nDuring the growth phase the electrojet drifted southward to\nexceptionally low latitudes, where the pseudo-breakup was\nrecorded as a minor intensification at 21:06 UT and the main\nonset as a sequence of pulsations followed by a poleward\nexpansion of the activity starting at 21:18 UT. With the par-\nticle and magnetic field data of the fortunate satellite con-\nstellation, Sergeev et al. (2005) were able to show that at the\nmain onset the activity propagated from a midtail reconnec-\ntion region (XGSM<\u221216RE) earthwards and thus was fa-\nvorable to the NENL scenario. However, about 12 min prior\nto the onset a local pseudo-breakup took place that was most\nprominent in the geostationary observations and thus likely\ntriggered by inner magnetospheric instabilities, as suggested\nby the CD-scenario. Another interesting observation for this\nsubstorm was that the energy storage in the lobe magnetic\nfield became exceptionally large during the growth phase but\nthe subsequent expansion was only moderate (AE\u223c400 nT).\nThis contrast between the massive energy loading during the\ngrowth phase and the subsequent moderate dissipation dur-\ning the expansion was explained as due to the cold and dense\nFig. 17. North component magnetogram from the MIRACLE mag-\nnetometer station Troms\u00f8 (TRO) and data from Cluster 3 (gray)\nand 4 (black). The substorm onset and intensifications have been\nmarked by dashed vertical lines. (From Bora\u00a8lv et al., 2002.)\nplasma sheet before the substorm.\nA detailed comparison between the ionosphere and mag-\nnetosphere for a small substorm with several intensifications\nwas performed by Bora\u00a8lv et al. (2002) based on ground-\nbased observations from the Northern Hemisphere and Clus-\nter observations from the southern plasma sheet (at a down-\ntail distance of 18.5RE). The substorm (maximum AE only\nabout 100 nT) took place in the Scandinavian sector on 19\nSeptember 2001 at 20:00\u201323:00 UT. Solar wind data from\nWIND (at XGSM=83RE) shows that IMF BZ turned to neg-\native values around 20:11 UT (at the satellite, time delay to\nthe magnetopause 16 min), and stayed barely below zero dur-\ning the following 1.5 h. According to the MIRACLE mag-\nnetometer data the substorm onset took place at 20:40 UT\nand had three further intensifications at 21:09, 21:15, and\n21:51 UT. Recovery started at 22:15 UT. ASC images show\na breakup at 20:39 UT followed by continuous activity until\n22:04 UT. EISCAT data showed ionospheric electron tem-\nperature enhancements roughly at the times of the onset and\nintensifications (for ASC and EISCAT data, see Bora\u00a8lv et al.,\n2005).\nGround-based magnetic field observations, together with\ndata from Cluster s\/c 3 and 4, are shown in Fig. 17 from\nO. Amm et al.: Coordinated Cluster and ground-based studies 2153\nBora\u00a8lv et al. (2002). The plotted quantitites are, from\ntop to bottom, the ground magnetic field north compo-\nnent at MIRACLE station Troms\u00f8 (TRO, CGM lat 66.6\u25e6,\nMLT=UT+2.5 h), the FGM magnetic field strength, the CIS\nH+ density and velocity, a PEACE proxy for the electron\ndensity (energy range from 34 eV to 26.46 keV), and fi-\nnally the RAPID high-energy electron (energy range 20\u2013\n400 keV) flux. The westward ionospheric current intensifi-\ncations observed as negative deviations in the ground-based\nBX (marked with the vertical dotted lines) are associated with\ndistinct variations in the plasma sheet magnetic field and en-\nhancements in the particle densities. The correlation in CIS\nvelocity data is not that obvious (the high velocities observed\nby s\/c 3, for example, during 21:30\u201322:00 UT were recorded\nin the lobe conditions of low count rates and thus may not be\nreliable).\nThe variations in the CIS and PEACE densities in Fig. 17\ncan be interpreted as s\/c motion between the high density\nplasma in the plasma sheet or plasma sheet boundary layer\n(PSBL) and low density plasma in the southern lobe. At the\nonset, Cluster moved from the plasma sheet to the southern\nlobe where they stayed until the substorm recovery except\nduring the short plasma sheet or PSBL encounters around the\nsubstorm intensification times. The correlation between the\nground-based activations and the s\/c plasma sheet encounters\nis remarkably good when remembering that the observations\nwere made on the different sides of the current sheet. By\nperforming the multi-point timing analysis, the directions of\nthe PSBL\/lobe boundary motions were detemined for these\ncases. The plasma sheet encounters at 21:09 and 21:15 UT\nwere associated with travelling compression regions (TCRs),\npossibly caused by moving bulges in the plasma sheet-lobe\ninterface, as demonstrated by a detailed analysis of the Clus-\nter observation (Slavin et al., 2003). Results from the timing\nanalysis of the plasma sheet-lobe interface observations from\nCluster for the substorm onset, as well as for the subsequent\nintensifications, implied that plasma sheet motions in the Y-\ndirection were as significant as in the Z-direction. For ex-\nample, the PSBL moved dawnward when Cluster exited into\nthe lobe at the substorm onset (for a more detailed analysis,\nsee Bora\u00a8lv et al., 2005). This is difficult to understand in the\ntraditional picture where the entire plasma sheet drops out\nwhen associated with the plasma sheet thinning. These ob-\nservations suggest either that a localized plasma sheet thin-\nning took place locally centered at the onset region or that\nflapping of the entire current sheet occurred as in another\nevent observed by Cluster, reported by Sergeev et al. (2003).\nThe event of Bora\u00a8lv et al. (2002) demonstrates nicely how\na tiny substorm, at least in terms of ground-based activity\n(AE-index), can cause significant variations in the magne-\ntotail. Furthermore, the study showed how the propagation\ndirection of the disturbance, which is new information ob-\ntained by Cluster multipoint analysis, can contribute to the\nunderstanding of plasma sheet dynamics during substorms.\nDraper et al. (2004) present Cluster observations in the\ntail during two substorms in conjunction with ionospheric\nflow measurements with SuperDARN. The flows stimulated\nj\n \nV\nr\n \neconnection\nregion\nj\nFig. 18. Illustration of the plasma bubble model (Chen and Wolf,\n1993) and associated field aligned currents (Adapted from Naka-\nmura et al., 2001).\nby the second expansion phase onset occur of the order of\n1 min after the simultaneous signatures of expansion phase\nonset at Cluster in the lobe, at geosynchronous orbit and in\nground magnetometer data. This demonstrates that the ex-\npansion phase is responsible for the onset of enhanced flows,\nalthough the nature of the observations does not allow the\nauthors to determine whether this is stimulated by reconnec-\ntion. During the recovery phase of the first substorm, the\nCluster spacecraft observed the earthward passage of a dia-\nmagnetic cavity of near-zero magnetic field, which is a new\nand interesting phenomenon. Its possible ionospheric signa-\nture has yet to be confirmed.\n4.4 Fast flows\nOne of the most important topics in BBF studies is its rela-\ntionship to the ionospheric processes. The observed equiv-\nalent current pattern during flow bursts suggests that the\nplasma sheet flows are connected to the ionospheric cur-\nrent via a small field-aligned current wedge (Kauristie et al.,\n2000). Chen and Wolf (1993; 1999) proposed that BBFs can\nbe considered as underpopulated flux tubes that are electri-\ncally polarized and thereby launch Alfve\u00b4n waves in a sense\nwhere upward FAC is flowing at the duskward edge (see\nFig. 18). Birn and Hesse (1996) and Birn et al. (1999; 2004)\nshowed that earthward reconnection flows are diverted dawn-\nward and duskward in association with the dipolarization\nof the magnetic field and consequently FACs of the current\nwedge are generated by the flow shear in the closed field line\nregion.\nA review of the various ionospheric phenomena related to\nthe fast flows is given by Amm and Kauristie (2002). One\nmajor question they pose concerns the difference between\nsubstorm and non-substorm events. They also point out that\nmany of the observed ionospheric effects can be shielded\nor greatly obscured during substorm expansions, by the in-\nherent large-scale electrodynamics. As will be reviewed in\nthe following section, Cluster observations of BBFs, com-\nbined with conjugate ionospheric observations, allow us to\ndiscuss the spatial structure of the disturbances and rele-\nvant electrodynamics both at the ionosphere and the mag-\nnetosphere. Cluster-GB observations are also crucial for\n2154 O. Amm et al.: Coordinated Cluster and ground-based studies\nquantitative determination of the role of the fast flows in the\nglobal magnetospheric energy conversion processes.\nGrocott et al. (2004) studied the ionospheric counterpart\nof a BBF which occurred during a pseudo-breakup in the\ncourse of a substorm growth phase, some 10 min after a\nsouthward turning of the IMF and some 50\u201360 min before\na major expansion phase onset, thus largely circumventing\nany effects from the substorm expansion phase in the iono-\nsphere. This is the first study showing both the ionospheric\nflow pattern and the auroral activation associated with a si-\nmultaneous observation of a flow burst in the magnetosphere.\nCluster observed earthward flow with a perpendicular com-\nponent reaching 400 km s\u22121 between 22:28 and 22:35 UT on\n7 September 2001 when the spacecraft was near midnight,\n(X, Y , Z) GSE=(\u221219, 1.3, 0.7)RE (not shown). Ionospheric\nobservations during the flow event observed by the CUT-\nLASS radars, the MIRACLE and SAMNET magnetometers\nand the FUV auroral imager on the IMAGE spacecraft are\nshown in Fig. 19, adapted from Grocott et al. (2004). A\nsmall, negative excursion in the X component of the mag-\nnetic field with an amplitude of 10 nT and some Pi2 activity,\nwere observed at the ground stations close to the footpoint\nof Cluster during the BBF (Fig. 19a). Clear signatures as-\nsociated with the BBF are observed in the ionospheric flow\nobtained by CUTLASS, as well as in the auroral precipitation\npattern in the IMAGE UV data (Figs. 19b and c). During the\ninterval shown in Figs. 19b and c, the auroral activity was at\nits maximum, with a developed \u201cblob\u201d of auroral emission\ncentered at around 67\u25e6 N where the Cluster footpoint was\nlocated (shown as an open circle). Figures 19b and c also\nshow the flow vectors and equipotential contours derived us-\ning the Map Potential technique (see Sect. 2.3). This local-\nized auroral activation and the enhanced ionospheric flows\n(1000 m s\u22121) were first observed between 22:28\u201322:30 UT\n(not shown), which was within 2 min of the plasma sheet\nflow onset, near the Cluster footpoint. The aurora further de-\nveloped at 22:32\u201322:34 UT (Fig. 19b) and the pre-midnight\nflows developed into an \u201cS\u201d shape with the aurora located in\nthe velocity shear between east and west flows. The field-\naligned current pattern in Fig. 19c is inferred from the curl of\nthe velocity field (derived from the electric potential) using\nthe technique described by McWilliams et al. (2001b), in-\nterpreting the obtained vorticity to be due to the ionospheric\nHall currents\u2019 vortices associated with field-aligned currents.\nThe region of high intensity emission in the pre-midnight au-\nroral zone, including the Cluster footpoint, corresponds to an\nupward field-aligned current. A region of downward field-\naligned current exists poleward of this and slightly later in\nmagnetic local time. This field aligned current pattern is sim-\nilar to a substorm current wedge. However, the weak mag-\nnetic field perturbation indicates the absence of the westward\nelectroject, expected to close the field aligned currents, and\nsuggests a low Hall current as well as a low Pedersen conduc-\ntivity. This is in contrast to the active intervals, such as during\nsubstorms, when the enhanced conductivity significantly af-\nfects the ionospheric current and electric field, as was shown\nin the example of a N-S aurora (Amm et al., 1999). Although\nthese N-S aurora or auroral streamers have been considered\nto be conjugate to the magnetospheric fast flows (Sergeev\net al., 1999), no significant enhancement in the equatorward\nionospheric flow was detected in the vicinity of this N-S au-\nrora, but significant conductivity enhancement in the auroral\nregion was observed (Amm et al., 1999).\nNakamura et al. (2005) used multi-point observations both\nin space and on the ground to study an isolated flow burst\nevent on 1 September 2002 at 22:02 UT, when the Cluster\nfootpoint was located within the MIRACLE area. Similar to\nGrocott et al. (2004), the event was associated with a clear\nbut weak ionospheric disturbance, which took place during\na prolonged, almost 1.5 h, southward IMF interval preceding\na major substorm onset (Draper et al., 2004). Results from\nthe magnetospheric and ionospheric observations of the flow\nburst event are summarized in Fig. 20. Cluster magnetic field\nand ion observations in Figs. 20a\u2212e show that earthward\nflow with the speed exceeding 700 km s\u22121 was observed in\nassociation with a sharp enhancement in BZ , indicating dipo-\nlarization. The flow was accompanied by a decrease in den-\nsity and an increase in magnetic field pressure (not shown),\nwhich is a signature for an underpopulated flux tube (Sergeev\net al., 1996).\nThe structure of the fast flows was determined by exam-\nining the orientation of the dipolarization front, by perform-\ning the minimum variance analysis of the magnetic field in\nthe same way as in Sergeev et al. (1996) and Nakamura et\nal. (2002). The obtained direction of the dipolarization front\nis shown in Fig. 20f. The shape of the dipolarization front\nis expected to reflect the spatial structure of the fast flowing\nplasma. If we simply assume a dipolarization front with a\ncircular shape in the X\u2212Y plane, as illustrated by the grey\ncurve in Fig. 20f, the dimension of the front, and therefore\nthe spatial scale of a flow channel, is estimated to have a\nwidth of about 1.5\u20132.2RE . This is consistent with a typi-\ncal scale of a flow burst obtained from a Cluster multi-point\nstatistical study (Nakamura et al., 2004). The pink arrows,\nillustrating the direction of the flow shear, indicate that there\nis a clockwise flow rotation in the vicinity of the dipolariza-\ntion front. The corresponding magnetic shear will produce\na field-aligned current out of the ionosphere, as expected at\nthe dusk part of a current wedge-like field-aligned current\npattern.\nFigure 20g shows the equivalent current pattern near the\nfootpoint of Cluster, using the 2-D upward continuation tech-\nnique described in Sect. 2.2. Although the amplitude of\nthe disturbance in the equivalent current associated with the\nflow did not exceed several tens of nT, a clear, localized pat-\ntern developed, consisting of a south-westward directed cur-\nrent in the region, including the Cluster footpoint and north-\nwestward directed current at the northeast side of the for-\nmer. Such an equivalent current pattern was also obtained\nfor an N-S aurora during an active substorm time (Amm et\nal., 1999), except for the larger amplitude and wider area\nof the current compared to the event in Fig. 20. The ob-\nserved equivalent current pattern in Fig. 20g suggested that\nthere was an upward field-aligned current in the vicinity of\nO.

(2005) were from intervals of low geomagnetic activity,\nMcPherron et al. (2002) reported fast flows during an active\nperiod when Cluster passed through the plasma sheet dur-\ning three consecutive substorms. During the third substorm,\nCluster measured a prolonged earthward flow while the GSM\nZ component of the magnetic field increased. This earthward\nflow was bursty, and reached a peak of 900 km s\u22121. During\nthis substorm interval (about 60 min), the tail lobe field, as\nwell as IMF, was almost unchanged, implying that the day-\nside and nightside reconnection rates were balanced. This, in\nturn, suggested that the electric field in the tail lobe and the\nplasma sheet were equal. Since the lobe electric field can be\nconsidered to map into the polar cap, the plasma sheet po-\ntential can be equated to the cross polar cap potential, which\nwas measured during this interval by SuperDARN and was\nfound to be steady at 50 kV. This value and the flux trans-\nported during this interval, due to the fast flows, were used to\nobtain the width of flow channel. The total flux transported\nfor a channel of width 1RE during 60 min, was 20 MWb\/RE .\nFrom these values the width of an equivalent flow channel\nwas estimated to be 7.8RE . It should be noted that such an\nequivalent flow channel might be made up of several smaller,\nreal channels.\nThe study concluded that 100% of the flux entering the\nlobe during this time interval could have been returned by the\nobserved flow. On the other hand, Angelopoulos et al. (1994)\nconcluded that a single BBF transports only about 2% of the\ntotal flux necessary to create a substorm that is driven by a\npolar cap potential of 150 kV. This estimate was based on\nnumbers obtained from their statistics: duration time of 550 s\nand transported flux of 2.5 MWb\/RE for each BBF; in addi-\ntion, it was assumed that a flow channel is 3RE wide. The\ndifference in the two estimates of the transport rate comes\nfrom the longer duration and therefore larger flux transport,\nand a wider flow channel, but smaller polar cap potential for\nthe former study (McPherron et al., 2002). It is an interesting\nopen question as to whether these different magnetospheric\ntransport rates are due to different states of the magneto-\nsphere. Further study is needed to explain how the substorm\nBBFs studied by McPherron et al. (2002) are related to the\nsingle BBFs during weak geomagnetic activity, discussed in\nGrocott et al. (2004) and Nakamura et al. (2005).\n4.5 Auroral arcs\nAuroral arcs are the result of magnetosphere-ionosphere cou-\npling. In particular, visible arcs are a manifestation of energy\ninput from the magnetosphere to the ionosphere. The vis-\nible arc corresponds to an upward FAC sheet region. The\ncurrent continuity requires a downward FAC sheet region,\nwhich for an isolated stable arc is typically located on the\nequatorward (poleward) side of the evening (morning) sector\narc (Opgenoorth et al., 1990; Aikio et al., 1993) or sometimes\non both sides (e.g. Aikio et al., 2002).\nMany properties of auroral arcs can be described by a\nquasi-electrostatic model, where the upward FAC region cor-\nresponds to precipitating magnetospheric electrons which\nhave been accelerated downward by a field-aligned potential\ndrop. A satellite moving across the arc, within and above the\nacceleration altitudes, measures a converging bipolar electric\nfield (see Fig. 21). The upward electric field of the nega-\ntive potential structure accelerates ambient ions upward, pro-\nducing upward ion beams and a high-altitude density cavity\n(Mozer et al., 1980). The downward FAC region has a re-\nversed (positive) potential structure, which accelerates iono-\nspheric electrons upward to carry the return current of aurora\n(e.g. Carlson et al., 1998). The cold, upward moving electron\nbeams are accompanied by transversely heated ions and ion\nconics. The dominant ion heating seems to be from broad-\nband, extremely low frequency (BBELF) wave emissions be-\nlow the ion plasma frequency (e.g. Andre\u00b4 et al., 1998).\nAlfve\u00b4n waves play a crucial role in setting up the auro-\nral electrodynamics. Poynting flux from Alfve\u00b4n waves often\ndominates the energy transport from the tail reconnection re-\ngion (Wygant et al., 2000). As the large-scale Alfve\u00b4n waves\npropagate toward the auroral acceleration region, small-scale\nAlfve\u00b4nic structures can be generated through various plasma\nphysical processes. These dispersive Alfve\u00b4n waves carry a\nparallel electric field, which can accelerate electrons to the\nionosphere (Stasiewicz et al., 2000).\nIn the following, new results of the auroral arc dynamics\nobtained by the Cluster-GB coordination will be presented.\nThe four-satellite constellation of Cluster has provided the\nopportunity to study the temporal evolution of quasi-static\nfields, as was shown by Marklund et al. (2001) in their study\non downward FAC evolution. Yet, the typical configuration\nO. Amm et al.: Coordinated Cluster and ground-based studies 2157\nFig. 22.

Ground-based\nobservations allow the distinction to be made and can also\nprovide a longer timeline of observations and wider spatial\ncoverage.\nAikio et al. (2004) studied the temporal evolution of two\nauroral arcs by the Cluster s\/c, all-sky cameras and magne-\ntometers of the MIRACLE network, as well as the EISCAT\nUHF radar. The four Cluster s\/c passed over Northern Scan-\ndinavia in the poleward direction on 6 February 2001 at a\ndistance of about 4.4RE in the post-midnight sector. The\ns\/c followed two closely spaced strings of pearls, allowing\nthe study of the temporal evolution of arcs with a time scale\nof one to a few minutes.

The\nGB observations showed a pseudo-breakup onset while the\nCluster s\/c were passing the arc and as a result, the total FAC\ndoubled between the s\/c 1 and 2 crossings of the arc, sepa-\nrated by about 80 s. The increase was due to a widening of\nthe FAC sheets, not due to an increase in current densities. It\ntook 1\u20132 min for the current systems to evolve after the on-\nset of sub-auroral Pi2 pulsations, which may indicate that it\ntook several bounces of Alfve\u00b4n waves between the magneto-\nsphere and the ionosphere to set up the new current system\nafter changes in the magnetosphere.\nAbout 8 min after the pseudobreakup onset, a new arc\nstarted to form poleward of the existing arc, close to the\nzenith of the Abisko ASC (65.3\u25e6 N, 102\u25e6 E). Two Cluster\ns\/c (2 and 4) crossed a fold in the arc (Fig. 22, top panel).\nAgain, the visible arc was associated with an upward FAC\n(Fig. 23, second panel).

Within the same region, downgoing,\nlocally accelerated, suprathermal electron beams were ob-\nserved (Fig. 23, bottom panel). It was suggested that elec-\ntrons were accelerated by dispersive Alfve\u00b4n waves. How-\never, since the suprathermal electrons were of low energy\n(200 eV), it was concluded that they were not able to pro-\nduce the visible auroral arc observed at the wavelength of\n557.7 nm (and only weakly at 630 nm), but the electrons had\nto be further energised below the s\/c. The return current\n(downward FAC) regions were located on both sides of the\narc, but the poleward return current was wider and more in-\ntense, as shown for s\/c 2 in Fig. 23, second panel. PEACE\nelectron measurements showed that the arc was embedded in\nthe central plasma sheet (Fig. 23, three bottom panels). The\ndownward FACs were associated with cold upward beams of\nelectrons of ionospheric origin, which had been accelerated\nbelow the s\/c (Fig. 23, third panel). The energy of the elec-\ntrons in the poleward downward FAC increased from 200 eV\nat s\/c 2 to 1000 eV at s\/c 4 in 70 s. At the same time, there\nwas a small increase in the width of the current from 50 to\n70 km from s\/c 2 to 4, while the total FAC remained constant.\nThe EISCAT radar, which was located within the poleward\ndownward FAC region, showed the formation of an elec-\ntron density cavity in the ionospheric E and lower F regions\n(Fig. 22, middle panel) during the time when the arc was\nbright at the meridian of EISCAT (the fold and the arc were\npropagating eastward). A strong ion temperature increase\nindicated the presence of an intense horizontal electric field\n(Fig. 22, bottom panel). The observations were interpreted as\nfollows: As the density cavity due to the downward FAC in\nthe ionosphere forms, the ionospheric Pedersen conductance\ndecreases and the return current region forms a growing load\nfor the current circuit. In order to maintain the horizontal\npart of the current system, the horizontal electric field has to\nincrease, as happened according to the EISCAT radar obser-\nvations. The evacuation of ionospheric electrons carrying the\nfield-aligned return current implies that, in order to maintain\na sufficient return current, either the energy of the electrons\nmust be increased or the current region must be widened.\nCluster observations indicated that both processes occurred.\nThe basic physical reason for the formation of the cavity is\nthat the downward FAC is carried by upward moving iono-\nspheric electrons, whereas the horizontal Pedersen current is\ncarried by ions in the E and lower F region, and in order to\nmaintain plasma neutrality, a net outflow of charge carriers\noccurs in the current closure region (see Fig. 21). Simula-\ntions of cavity formation by Doe et al. (1995) and Karlsson\nand Marklund (1998) have shown that a cavity can form in a\ntime scale of some tens of seconds to a few seconds.\nInvestigations using the Polar satellite have shown that at\nhigh altitudes (4\u20136RE) the downward Poynting flux carried\nby Alfve\u00b4n waves may dominate over the energy of precipitat-\ning particles at the outer edge of the plasma sheet (Wygant et\nal., 2000). It was suggested that a large part of the Poynting\nflux is converted to parallel particle acceleration in the au-\nroral acceleration region.Vaivads et al. (2003) compared the\nenergy flux carried by the Poynting flux at Cluster s\/c to the\nelectron energy flux measured by the low-altitude DMSP F14\nsatellite. The conjunction (geomagnetic longitude of Cluster\ndiffered by 40\u201380 km from F14) took place in the Southern\nHemisphere at 20:00 MLT on 28 April 2001. Cluster crossed\na quiet time auroral arc at a geocentric distance of 4.7RE ,\nwell above the main acceleration region, whereas DMSP F14\nwas at an altitude of 850 km, well below the acceleration re-\ngion.\nThe auroral arc studied in Vaivads et al. (2003) appeared\nat a density gradient corresponding to the outer edge of the\nplasma sheet ion population. The speed and planarity of the\narc were estimated from the four Cluster s\/c. The estimated\npotential drops of 3\u20134 kV (Fig. 24, panel f) and the ener-\ngies of upgoing ions observed at Cluster altitudes gave val-\nues of the parallel acceleration potential in good agreement\nwith those derived from auroral electrons by DMSP (3 keV),\nsupporting the quasi-static U-potential model. The Poynting\nflux (Fig. 24, panel h) calculated for the bipolar electric field\nO. Amm et al.: Coordinated Cluster and ground-based studies 2159\nstructure (Fig. 24, panels a-d) and the accompanying mag-\nnetic field signature at Cluster yielded values of 70\u2013150 W\/m\n(projected to the ionosphere and with uncertainty of 50%),\nwhich were comparable to the value of 180 W\/m from pre-\ncipitating electrons at DMSP. The energy carried by elec-\ntrons and ions at Cluster altitudes was small. Thus, it was\nsuggested that the Poynting flux feeds the auroral electron\nacceleration.\nIn a companion paper, Wahlund et al. (2003) studied the\nbroad-band ELF emissions, which spanned a broader region\naround the auroral arc studied by Vaivads et al. (2003). It\nwas suggested that BBELF emissions are dispersed, linear,\npolarised Alfve\u00b4n waves (DAW) transporting energy down-\nward to the ionosphere and leading to particle acceleration\nwhen dissipating part or all of their energy along the propa-\ngation path by wave-particle coupling, causing ion heating,\nsuprathermal electron bursts and higher frequency ion-mode\nwaves, and possibly also electric potential structures. Indeed,\nsignificant H+ and O+ outflows with energies around 1 keV\nwere observed simultaneously with the broad-band emis-\nsions. In the study by Aikio et al. (2004), BBELF emissions\nwere observed both in up- and downward FAC regions, but\nthey were highly localised in space and time, and could ap-\npear\/disappear between two Cluster s\/c passages of the same\narc, which were separated by 60\u201390 s. Hence, auroral arcs\nare not all the time associated with intense BBELF fluctua-\ntions at high altitudes, though commonly observed by satel-\nlites.\nIon outflow from the auroral regions is a significant source\nof plasma in the magnetosphere, particularly during storm\ntimes. A number of statistical studies have shown how the\noutflow depends on location and geomagnetic activity. How-\never, Peterson et al. (2002) showed that the actual ion out-\nflow structures are filamentary in nature, and highly variable\nin space and time. Kistler et al. (2002) studied ion outflows\nfrom Cluster and IMAGE satellite data. The idea was that if\nthe outflow is correlated with arcs, the outflow regions would\nbe moving with the arcs. The Cluster pass was through the\nnorthern auroral oval, close to magnetic midnight at an alti-\ntude of 4.4\u20134.9RE during the 23 February 2001 substorm.\nSimultaneous observations of global aurora were available\nfrom the FUV instrument on the IMAGE satellite. Signifi-\ncant outflow of both H+ and O+ was observed by the CIS\nexperiment and the outflow was highly structured. A reason-\nable correspondence between the observed auroral structures\nand the energy of the ion outflow was found: the more in-\ntense auroral structures corresponded to higher energy ion\noutflow. Because of the high altitude of the Cluster space-\ncraft, it was not possible to determine whether the emissions\ncorresponded to ion beams or conics at lower altitude.\nThe multiple Cluster s\/c were used in Kistler et al. (2002)\nto determine the horizontal velocity of the outflow structures.\nThe ion outflow structures were moving mainly equatorward\nat about 0.7 km s\u22121 (value mapped to the ionosphere), with\none exception, which moved rapidly poleward at 1.5 km s\u22121\n(Fig. 25). In general, the motion of the ion outflow regions\nwas found to be consistent with the convective motion of\nFig. 25. A keogram showing the auroral emissions as a function of\ntime in the midnight MLT sector from the FUV camera on IMAGE.\nThe track of the Cluster 3 is given by the solid black line. The slopes\nof the black arrows give the horizontal velocities of the ion outflow\nstructures and the slopes of the white arrows give the convection\nvelocities determined from the EDI instrument on Cluster. (From\nKistler et al., 2002.)\nplasma observed by the EDI instrument (the slopes of black\nand white vectors coincide in Fig. 25). Although the overall\nauroras expanded poleward during this event, only one pole-\nward moving ion outflow region was observed. That time\nperiod did correspond to a time when the Cluster s\/c mapped\nto the poleward edge of an expanding aurora (see the iso-\ncontours of auroral emission intensity in Fig. 25). Thus, the\nquestion of whether the motion of the ion outflow region fol-\nlows the fast poleward motion of auroras, or the plasma con-\nvection, was left somewhat ambiguous.\n4.6 Summary\nAs shown in the previous sections, ground-based observa-\ntions have been effectively combined with both the Cluster\nperigee observations, where the orbit has a \u201cstring of pearl\u201d\nconfiguration and the satellites cross over the oval precipita-\ntion and upwelling structures at an altitude of 4RE ; and the\nCluster apogee observations at 19RE , which provide in-situ\nmeasurement of plasma and fields in the magnetotail. Here\nwe briefly summarize the results.\nThe temporal evolution of structures both across and along\nthe field lines of large-scale convection boundaries was ob-\ntained from Cluster perigee observations over GB networks.\nIt was found that the region 1 current sheet may split into two\nparts: one is produced by the conductivity gradient and the\nother by the positive divergence of the electric field. In an-\nother study, the polar cap boundary was determined by using\nhigh and low altitude satellites and radar measurements, and\nthe results were compared.\nBy combining ground-based observations with in-situ\nmeasurements of Cluster and also with other ISTP\n2160 O. Amm et al.: Coordinated Cluster and ground-based studies\nspacecraft, different aspects of substorms have been stud-\nied, such as onset mechanisms, global tail dynamics and\nionosphere-magnetosphere couplings. By using GB obser-\nvations for the accurate timing and localization of the distur-\nbance, and Cluster for monitoring the reconnection region, it\nwas found that reconnection was the primary mechanism for\nthe onset in several studies. In cases where the initial distur-\nbance region in the magnetosphere was not covered by Clus-\nter, multi-point observations with other spacecraft were used\nto determine the propagation direction of the disturbances.\nIn one event, the GB activations were associated with plasma\nsheet motions in the magnetotail, which were as significant\nin the Y as in the Z direction. Studies of this kind require that\na substorm onset occurs when the spacecraft constellation is\nin the correct position, and therefore only a limited number\nof events have been studied with Cluster so far.\nGlobal and dense coverage of the ground-based network\ndata enabled the identification of the detailed ionospheric re-\nsponse for localized structures in the magnetosphere, such\nas BBFs. These isolated flows took place during relatively\nquiet periods with weak precipitation and hence, the mag-\nnetospheric electric field feature was clearly identified in the\nionosphere because of the negligible effect of the conduc-\ntivity enhancements. The enhanced flows were associated\nwith a localized auroral activation. The Cluster separation of\n4000 km during 2002 was ideal to determine further the spa-\ntial structure of these flows, in comparison with ionospheric\ndisturbance in space and time. The scale size of the flow\nchannel was also identified in two studies, under quite dif-\nferent conditions of magnetic activity, and values of about\n2 and 8RE were obtained, where the latter one refers to an\nequivalent flow channel width.\nBy utilizing Cluster measurements at an altitude of about\n4.5RE and conjugate observations from the ground and low-\naltitude spacraft, interesting, new features of the auroral arc\ndynamics have been identified. It was shown that the high-\naltitude, downward Poynting flux is converted at the acceler-\nation region to a large extent by the precipitating electron\nenergy. Above aurora, upward accelerated ions are often\nmeasured; it was found that the highest energy ion outflows\ncorresponded to the brighest aurora. In one event, the tem-\nporal evolution of the return (downward) FAC region was\nstudied. Cluster observed electron beams, which were of\nionospheric origin and, in addition, accelerated between the\nionosphere and the s\/c, with an increase in acceleration po-\ntential from 200 to 1000 kV in 70 s. The EISCAT radar ob-\nserved formation of a density cavity in the return current re-\ngion, which lasted for a few minutes. Thus, obviously the\nevacuated part of the ionosphere formed a growing load for\nthe magnetosphere, which reacted by increasing the voltage\nbetween the ionosphere and the magnetosphere. This is an\nindication of the active role that the ionosphere can play in\nthe magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling.\nMany new results have been obtained from combined\nCluster and ground-based studies of the nightside processes.\nYet, there are still many questions to be answered by the com-\nbination of ground-based observations with Cluster observa-\ntions, and also with other ISTP and future missions. In the\nfollowing we list some of the important questions:\n\u2013 What is the consequence of the ion outflow in the mag-\nnetosphere?\n\u2013 What are the ionospheric signatures of flux ropes and\nX-line?\n\u2013 What are the magnetospheric signatures of auroral arcs?\n\u2013 How do localized processes such as BBF relate to larger\nscale magnetotail dynamics or a global substorm distur-\nbance in the ionosphere?\n\u2013 How do mid-tail and near-Earth disturbances interact\nduring substorm onsets?\nThe Cluster\/Double Star conjunction and the larger spatial\nseparation of Cluster, and the future project of global multi-\npoint spacecraft missions such as THEMIS, are expected to\ngive us some clues to these problems.\n5 Conclusions and outlook\nThis review illustrates how much coordinated ground-based\nobservations have, over the first four years of the Cluster\nmission, become an essential complement and a valuable\nsource of information for the scientific interpretation of in-\nsitu spacecraft measurements. In more than 30 selected ex-\namples it has been demonstrated that knowledge on the state\nof the surrounding plasma, and on the location or the dynam-\nics of boundaries during the encountered events is of utmost\nimportance when judging the physical relevance of in-situ\nobservations. Often equally important, information concern-\ning the recent past of encountered events gave crucial clues\non the pre-conditioning or stability of the plasma regimes\nprobed by the spacecraft. Sometimes, even the information\non the further development of certain events, as provided by\ncontinued observations of the event, long after the satellites\nhave passed the interesting region, allowed scientists to iden-\ntify events as, for example, pseudo-breakups or major onsets\nof energy release. Such additional knowledge after the fact\nwill help to identify proxies or representative indicators for\nfuture statistical studies, based on either data-set on its own.\nFor many of the described cases one would have been able\nto neither reach a conclusion on the large-scale impact of\nobserved micro-physical effects, nor on the scale of a dis-\nturbance, nor on the temporal persistence of a feature, were\nit not for the global or meso-scale and long-term simulta-\nneous coverage by ground-based data for these events. In\na way, planet Earth, with its network of advanced coordi-\nnated instrumentation, has indeed and very much, as origi-\nnally planned, become the \u201cfifth Cluster satellite\u201d, right at\nthe center of the global coupled system, constituted by the\nsolar wind, the magnetosphere and the ionosphere.\nOut of an enormous suite of standard, ground-based instru-\nments, networked magnetometers, ionospheric radars, and\nO. Amm et al.: Coordinated Cluster and ground-based studies 2161\noptical instruments provided the most important additional\ninput on large-scale or even sometimes global, spatial and\ntemporal context, while more local interaction and coupling\nprocesses have been addressed by localized, but highly spe-\ncialized ground-based facilities, such as incoherent scatter\nradars. ISRs can measure a number of ionospheric param-\neters at the same time and over a large a range of altitudes,\nbut only at a few selected locations or scan directions (see\nOpgenoorth and Lockwood, 1997). Together, with the use of\nappropriate models and being well embedded in other sup-\nporting network data, they have made major contributions to\nthe overall understanding of the observed processes.\nIt has also been tantalizing to see how the ground-based\nspace science community, together with its closest collabo-\nrators - modelers and principal investigators at low Earth or-\nbiting or imaging missions - have teamed up in their efforts to\nmake the best out of the unique opportunity provided by the\nCluster mission. On the hardware side networks have been\nestablished, maintained and globally interconnected, facili-\nties renovated or developed and new instrumentation, for ex-\nample, the EISCAT Svalbard Radar, has been put into place.\nOn the software side the provision of combined and often\nvalue-added data products, advanced data browsing, reduc-\ntion procedures and assimilative modeling, have allowed a\nlarger number of scientists, both from the space and ground-\nbased communities, to use multi-instrument data much more\nefficiently than previously. Cluster, even though coming into\norbit only at a late stage of the ISTP, has through this activity\nbecome the catalyst of an entirely new type of collaborative,\nmulti-instrument space physics.\nLooking more at the physical problems and phenomena\naddressed by the studies reviewed here in more detail, it\ncomes as no surprise that most deal either with localized fea-\ntures, such as arcs, fast flows, boundary dynamics and re-\nconnection regions, or with short-lived transients, like onsets\nof dayside reconnection, substorm energy release, and flow\nor energy bursts in entire or partial plasma populations. Un-\ndoubtedly, much progress has been made in the understand-\ning of individual events and many elusive features, such as\nauroral arcs, plasma flow channels, localized particle accel-\neration have been studied in greater detail. However, these\nstudies have also revealed that nature still mocks us (scien-\ntists) with an ever-changing behaviour and with ever-variable\nfeatures. Even if one finds a multitude of cases supporting\none particular theory, it is still always possible to find a small,\nbut significant number of counter-examples, supporting an\nopposing theory, or leaving doubts about the general validity\nof the prime theory. For example, it has definitively become\nclear that reconnection does occur at the expected locations\n(and often in transient form) for the appropriate directions of\nthe IMF, but reconnection also seems to occur at strange loca-\ntions and under strange or variable conditions. We have fur-\nthermore seen and verified examples of surprisingly steady\nreconnection signatures. Likewise in the nightside tail the\nspacing of the satellites and the intrinsic timing problems be-\ntween various magnetospheric regions have not yet allowed\nus to draw final conclusions about the nature of substorm\ntriggering. An important unresolved issue is whether there is\nalways one and only one initial trigger mechanism and con-\nsequent instability leading to a substorm, or whether several\nprocesses in the near-Earth tail and at the inner edge of the\nplasma sheet can trigger each other in a variety of causal rela-\ntions and temporal sequences. So it remains for future stud-\nies to leave the event-by-event state of analysis behind and\nto determine in a more refined or even statistical way which\nprocesses are in fact the dominant or governing ones, mean-\ning \u201coccurring most of the time, being the most likely to oc-\ncur, and also being most efficient in terms of energy transport\nfrom one plasma regime to another\u201d.\nWe feel that we have identified, described, analysed and,\nto some degree, even understood the majority of the phe-\nnomena occurring in the coupled solar wind magnetosphere\nionosphere system. However, we have not been able to\nput our finger on exactly which ones of all of these ob-\nserved processes are the dominant ones in the cross-scale\ncoupling mechanisms. Most of the features described in this\nreview deal in one way or another with the in-situ observa-\ntion of micro-physical processes which are observed to affect\nmacro-physical states and global distributions of plasma. We\ncan consequently identify two basic drawbacks with the data\npresently at our disposal. Even though we have basically vis-\nited all regions of the solar wind and magnetosphere at least\nonce, we have not yet had an opportunity to monitor in-situ\nthe relevant key space regions simultaneously, for example,\nthe near-Earth and mid-tail (plus, of course, the support from\nthe global GB set of observations), or the sub-solar magne-\ntopause and the high and low altitude cusps (again supported\nwith GB observations). Also, we have, so far, not been able\nto resolve the scale-size of one important plasma regime,\nthe electron scale, which may still hold the key to some of\nthe ever increasing collection of candidate wave-particle and\nwave-wave interaction mechanisms of importance for energy\ncoupling and trigger of larger scale instabilities.\nWhat then are the future opportunities provided by Clus-\nter, future contemporary and successor missions? It has al-\nready been mentioned that the advent of the complementary\nDouble Star mission will open new opportunities to study the\nmid-tail with Cluster and the near-Earth tail in the equatorial\nplane with DSP-1, while DSP-2 will probe the polar auro-\nral field lines. Similarly, the Cluster\/Double Star constella-\ntion will allow the monitoring of sub-solar magnetopause,\nexterior and interior cusp at the same time, providing ample\nnear-term science opportunities to improve on the findings\nof studies presented here. In the longer term the THEMIS\nmission, with its radially spaced spacecraft, will add on to\nsuch opportunities, hopefully still meeting parts of the Clus-\nter\/Double Star constellation in orbit.\nThe extension of the Cluster mission towards late 2009\nwill give even more exciting opportunities to address the\nidentified outstanding questions. In the first year even larger\ninter-spacecraft separations up to several RE will allow us\nto probe larger regions of space simultaneously, hopefully\nshedding more light on the temporal and causal event chains\nin the dayside and nightside magnetosphere. Larger s\/c\n2162 O. Amm et al.: Coordinated Cluster and ground-based studies\nseparation will also allow for the coverage of longer time\nintervals with consecutive passes of individual s\/c close to\nperigee. At about mid term of the intended extension the lack\nof fuel will force the Cluster project team to sacrifice the 3-\nD tetrahedron configuration of the Cluster s\/c, a drawback\nthat can be turned into a virtue. By moving only one satel-\nlite, the one with the maximum remaining fuel, closer and\ncloser to one partner s\/c, while holding the remaining 3 s\/c\nin a stable, two-dimensional, planar configuration, parallel\nto boundaries to be crossed, one can obtain a first glimpse\nat local cross-scale coupling mechanisms, by monitoring the\npresence or absence of certain small-scale (100 km or less)\nphenomena during large scale events. Even later in the Clus-\nter mission an ever increasing deterioration of the baseline\norbit, that is \u201csinking\u201d of perigee and apogee (towards lower\naltitudes and southern latitudes, respectively) will allow the\nmission to shortly visit previously excluded regions, such\nas the near-Earth auroral field lines, the sub-solar point and\nthe inner magnetosphere from 15RE down to as low as 6\nor 5RE , passing regions never visited by multi-spacecraft\nbefore. In summary, future missions in the magnetospheric\nrealm can provide many answers to the remaining questions,\nmostly on the chain of causality for local processes in a larger\nframework. However, so far actually no mission, which is\npresently in the plan of any larger space agency, addresses\nthe electron plasma scale, together with a simultaneous in-\nvestigation of ion and MHD scale phenomena, in the key re-\ngions of the magnetosphere. In the present brainstorming and\nfuture planning activities carried out by some of the larger\nspace agencies such needs have recently been formulated,\nand it remains to see whether these ideas, and most of all the\ncontinuous flow of ground breaking results from the Cluster\nmissions like the ones presented here, can lead our commu-\nnity to design the ultimate multi-spacecraft, multi-scale mis-\nsion for future magnetospheric research, which - almost no\nneed to mention it here - will, of course, never be complete\nwithout an ever improving, in terms of efficiency and cover-\nage, ground-based network of instruments.\nAcknowledgements.
