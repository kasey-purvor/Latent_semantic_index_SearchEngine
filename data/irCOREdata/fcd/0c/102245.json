Subsequent\namination with trimethylamine and ion-exchange to give the\nhydroxide ion forms yield anion-exchange membranes\n(AEMs) suitable for use in low temperature direct methanol\nfuel cells (DMFCs) for portable applications. The polymeric\nbackbone of the PVDF-based materials degrades on alkaline\ntreatment; significantly, this is not the case for the FEP-\nbased materials.\nTwo obstacles inhibiting application of DMFCs are (i) the\nrelatively low activity and high costs of methanol electro-\noxidation catalysts and (ii) methanol crossover through current\ngeneration proton-exchange membranes (PEMs).1 Liquid\nalkaline fuel cells (AFCs) have been developed to a significant\nlevel; a principle reason for this is that the catalysts generally\nperform better in alkaline conditions and at lower loadings, and a\nwider range of catalyst may be used.2 McLean et al. observed in\na recent review on AFCs that there is a great potential in the\nproduction of a polymer alkaline membrane fuel cell.3 There has\nrecently been growing interest in the literature on using AEMs in\nfuel cells,4 an example being recent work by Agel et al. on\npolyethylene oxide membranes containing dissolved potassium\nhydroxide. The stability of a commercially available AEM\ncontaining benzyltrimethyl ammonium groups radiation-grafted\nonto PTFE membranes in aqueous sodium hydroxide solution (6\nmol dm-3) was good up to temperatures between 50 - 60\u00b0C.5\nDMFCs operating at ambient conditions have been identified as\nideal for replacing batteries for portable applications (laptops,\ncellular phones, man-portable power packs) due to the ever\nincreasing power demands (especially with the imminent\nintroduction of mobile broadband communications) that will\nsurpass levels projected for secondary battery technology.6\nDMFCs are amenable to portable applications due to the good\npower density of the dense and easily replenished liquid fuel\n(methanol).\nUnder alkaline conditions the fuel cell reactions for the anode (1)\nand the cathode (2) are:\nProduct water is formed at the anode, in contrast to a cell\ncontaining a PEM. The use of an alkaline AEM could resolve the\nproblem of methanol crossover from the anode to the cathode as\nthe electro-osmotic water transport occurs in the opposite\ndirection; the use of cheaper catalysts would also be feasible.\nPolymer alkaline exchange membranes have been reported to\nfunction in the presence of carbonate species and could yield a\nsolution to the problem of carbonate build-up in liquid-based\nAFCs.3\nIn fuel cell membrane research the effort has been concentrated\non PEMs,7 with the focus being the development of cheaper\nalternatives to the industry standard Nafion\u00ae produced by\nDupont. A large proportion of this effort has examined styrene\nradiation-grafting onto partially fluorinated films8,9 such as\npoly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF, -[CH2CF2]n-) and fully\nfluorinated films9 such as poly(tetrafluoroethene-co-\nhexafluoropropylene) (FEP, \u2013[CF2CF2]n[CF(CF3)CF2]m-), with\nsubsequent sulfonation to form the cation-exchange sites. The\nattractiveness of this route is that the properties and\ncompositions of the final materials can be easily controlled.10 If\nvinylbenzyl chloride (VBC) is grafted onto PVDF and FEP\nanion- as opposed to proton, exchange membranes are produced\n(scheme 1).11 Here we report the comparison between AEMs\nproduced using PVDF and FEP base polymers.\nIn a typical grafting procedure PVDF (Solvay Chemicals, Solef\u00ae\n1008 homopolymer film, 40 \u00b5m thickness) and FEP\n(Goodfellow, 50 \u00b5m thickness) were irradiated with \u0002-rays from\na 60Co source to a total dose of 6.3 MRad in air. The irradiated\nfilms were then stored at -30\u00b0C until used. Known masses of the\nfilms were loosely rolled and immersed in excess VBC (Dow\nChemicals, 97% purity, meta\/para ratio of 1.3, stabilised with 75\nppm 4-t-butylcatechol and 733 ppm nitromethane, purged with\nnitrogen for 2 h before reaction) for around 1 week at 60\u00b0C.\nUnattached VBC and poly(VBC) were removed by washing in\ntoluene. A typical PVDF-g-PVBC membrane 1 was obtained\nwith a degree of grafting (d.o.g.)\u2020 of 54% and an average\nthickness of 54 \u00b5m. FEP-g-PVBC membrane 2 was obtained\nwith a d.o.g. of 27% and an average thickness of 66 \u00b5m.\nMembranes 1 and 2 were then aminated by immersion in\ntrimethylamine (Acros Organics, 45% aqueous solution) at room\ntemperature for 1 week, forming the chloride-forms 3 and 4\nrespectively. Immersion in excess aqueous potassium hydroxide\n(1 mol dm-3) for 48h yields the hydroxide ion forms 5 and 6\nrespectively. The aminated PVDF materials were obtained as\ndark red-brown membranes, while the aminated FEP materials\nwere obtained as clear, colourless membranes. The membrane 5\n(60 \u00b5m) was brittle, showed a short term temperature stability of\n155\u00b0C in flowing oxygen,\u2021 and had an ion-exchange capacity\n(IEC)\u00a7 of 0.7 meq g-1 compared with a calculated value of 2.0\nmeq g-1; the hydroxide-form of the FEP analogue 6 (95 \u00b5m)\nremained elastic and strong, showed a short term temperature\nstability of 160\u00b0C in flowing oxygen, and had an IEC of 1.0 meq\ng-1 compared with a calculated value of 1.3 meq g-1.\nThe brittleness and low IEC of 5 (considering the high d.o.g.)\nsuggests structural collapse of the PVDF backbone on alkali\ntreatment; dehydrofluorination of PVDF had been previously\nreported at elevated temperatures in the presence of concentrated\nhydroxide and surfactant,12 so it is clear that the amination\nprocess has enabled this degradation process to occur at lower\ntemperatures and with a lower concentration of hydroxide.\nMembrane 6 remained strong and exhibited a high IEC\u00b6\nsuggesting the FEP-based material remained intact. The\ndegradation of the PVDF-based membranes compared with the\nstability of the FEP-based membranes was clearly demonstrated\nwhen the 19F{1H} DP-MAS NMR spectra of PVDF\u2021\u2021, FEP\u00a7\u00a7 and\nmembranes 1 \u2013 6 were studied (Varian Unity 300 MHZ\nspectrometer). Membrane 1 showed the same signals as PVDF\u2021\u2021,\nthough a small amount of signal broadening indicated some\nmorphological changes. However, on amination to 3 the F3\nCH3OH + 6OH- \u0003 CO2 + 5H2O + 6e-\n3\/2O2 + 3H2O +6e- \u0003 6OH-\n(1)\n(2)\nCREATED USING THE RSC COMMUNICATION TEMPLATE - SEE HTTP:\/\/WWW.RSC.ORG\/IS\/JOURNALS\/TEMPLATES\/TEMPLATES.HTM FOR FURTHER DETAILS\n2\nsignal increased in intensity while both the F2 and F3 signals\nbroadened considerably. A small shoulder signal appeared at \u0004 =\n-119. This signal increased in intensity considerably on\nconversion to the hydroxide-form 5; the narrow linewidth\nsuggests that this signal was due to a highly mobile species.\nThese observations demonstrated that the backbone began to\ndegrade with the amination step and this degradation was\nexasperated with immersion in alkali. In comparison, the 19F\nsignals for FEP\u00a7\u00a7, 2, 4, and 6 did not change in any way,\nindicating structural stability.\nThe 15N CP-MAS NMR spectrum of vinylbenzyl\ntrimethylammonium chloride contains a single signal at \u0004 = -\n329. This single signal remains in the spectra of 3 \u2013 6 showing\nthe only nitrogen species present in these AEMs belongs to the\nbenzyltrimethylammonium group. However, the signal to noise\nratio is dramatically reduced for membrane 5 indicating\nsubstantial removal of these ammonium groups; this correlates\nwith the low IEC for this material and is further evidence of\nmaterial degradation.\nIt can be concluded that AEMs produced using this synthetic\nmethodology are promising only when fully fluorinated base\nfilms are used. PVDF-based membranes degrade on amination\nand hydroxide ion exchange. These results suggest the\nmembranes synthesised by Svarfar et al. [11] will be structurally\nunstable on contact with alkali.\nInitial a.c. impedance spectroscopic measurements on membrane\n6 gave conductivities of \u0005 = 0.02 S cm-1 at ambient temperatures\nand atmospheric relative humidity RH = 100%. These initial\nresults show that these AEMs are promising for the intended\napplication as they are comparable with Nafion-117 under the\nsame conditions (as measured in-house on the same equipment);\nincreased levels of grafting should lead to increased\nconductivity. Further work will explore these results in detail\nalong with long-term temperature stabilities of the hydroxide-\nform AEMs in water at various temperatures, and along with fuel\ncell test data with both hydrogen and methanol as fuels.\nAcknowledgement\nWe thank Keith Lovell for irradiation of FEP and PVDF films at\nthe Royal Military College Shrivenham, Cranfield University\nand for discussions.

The amount of unreacted H+ was then\ndetermined by titration with aqueous KOH (0.1 mol dm-3). The amount\nof H+ reacted with the polymer divided by the mass of the dry membrane\n(converted back to the Cl- form by immersion in aqueous HCl (1 mol dm-\n3\n, 48 h) and dried in a desiccator over anhydrous CaCl2 (RH = 0%, > 1\nweek)) gives the IEC.\n\u00b6 The value was lower than the theoretical maximum as the dried\nmembrane still contains water associated with the quaternary ammonium\ngroups (confirmed by infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetry).\n\u2021\u2021 The 19F NMR of PVDF has previously been assigned:13 F1\ncrystalline signal at \u0004 = -82, F2 amorphous signal at \u0004 = -91 with the F3\ncrystalline signal appearing as a shoulder, and the D1 and D2 defect\nsignals at \u0004 = -113 and -115 respectively, corresponding to the head-head\nand tail-tail defect units.\n\u00a7\u00a7 The 19F NMR of FEP has previously been assigned:14 An intense\nsignal at \u0004 = -122 (CF2 backbone, also observed for PTFE) and weak\nsignals at \u0004 = -186 (CF(CF3)), -112 (CF2 next to CF(CF3) groups), and -\n72 (CF3).\n1 J.
