A purpose built test-rig was employed for generating natural \ndegradation on a shaft. It was concluded that AE technology successfully detected \nnatural cracks induced on slow speed shafts. \n \nKeywords:  Acoustic Emissions, condition monitoring, natural cracks, shafts. \n \n1 Introduction \n \nRotating machinery are fatigue loaded machines and operational experience with \nthese machines showed that their components fail high rates which perturbs the \nnormal operating conditions. The primary causes of damages are misalignment, \nimpacting, and cyclic fatigue. Shafts are experience cyclic load conditions, are \ndifficult to access for maintenance and are vulnerable to cracks nucleation and \ngrowth. Predicting and preventing the crack phenomenon has attracted the attention of \nmany researchers and has continued to provide a large incentive for the use of \ncondition monitoring techniques to detect the earliest stages of cracks. Slow speed \nrotating machinery results in reduced energy loss rates from damage related processes \nand therefore condition monitoring technologies (e.g. vibration analysis) tend to be \nmore difficult to apply. Vibration diagnosis still remains the most widely used method \nfor detecting cracks in rotating machinery though Jamaludin et al [1] summarized the \nmain problems in applying vibration to slow rotating machines. However, the \nAcoustic Emission (AE) technology is well suited to detecting very small energy \nrelease rates. Thus, considerable success has been reported in the application of AE to \nmonitoring slow speed machinery components (e.g. bearings) [1, 2, 3, 4 and 5].   \n \nAcoustic Emission (AE) is a term describing a class of phenomenon whereby \ntransient elastic waves are generated by the rapid release of energy from localized \nsources within or on the surface of a material [6]. Sources of AE in rotating \nmachinery include impacting, friction, turbulence, cavitations, leakage, etc. The \ntypical frequency range associated with AE is between 100 kHz and 1 MHz. \nLimitations and difficulties in application of AE to machinery has been detailed [7]. \nElforjani et al [4 and 5] applied the AE technology to detect natural crack initiation \nand propagation on slow speed bearings which is one of the few publications that \naddress natural mechanical degradation on rotating machine components. This \ninvestigation presents a controlled experiment that ascertains the applicability of the \nAE technology for monitoring cracks initiation and growth on slow speed shafts. \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n 2 \n2 Experimental Program and Setup \n \nThe test rig consists of three bearings on one rotating shaft which incorporated a \ncoupling system and an electrical geared motor (MOTOVARIO-Type HA52 B3-B6-\nB7 j20, 46-Lubricated: AGIP). Two tapered roller bearings, single row (SKF 30207 \nJ2\/Q) were employed to support the shaft. An overhang cylindrical roller bearing, \nsingle row (SKF NU 1007 ECP) was used to locate the hydraulic load rod onto the \nshaft. To accelerate crack initiation and growth, a V-Notched shaft of 235 mm length \nand 35 mm diameter was designed. A radial load was applied to the shaft through the \noverhang bearing by a hydraulic system (Hi-Force HYDRAULICS-MODEL No: \nHP110-HAND PUMP-SINGLE SPEED-WORKING PRESSURE: 700 BAR). The \ndesign procedures of the shaft are presented in appendix A. The test rig rotational \nspeed was kept constant at 72 RPM. A flexible coupling was employed to absorb any \nvibration as a result of attaching the shaft to the geared motor, see figure 1. To capture \nAE\u2019s from the rotating shaft a specifically designed oil-bath was constructed onto \nwhich an AE sensor was placed, see figure 1. A plastic material was selected for the \nseals of both oil-bath sides and consequently there was no mechanical contact \nbetween the shaft and oil-bath that could result in a noise generation. This enclosed \ncircular bath allowed for direct contact between the rotating shaft and the oil. The \nenclosed bath was completely filled with oil (CASTROL, Alpha, SP, 460, 3186DM). \n \n \n \nFigure 1  Test rig components. \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n 3 \n3 Data Acquisition System \n \nTwo Physical Acoustics Corporation WD transducers were employed. These are \npiezoelectric sensors with a bandwidth of 200-750 kHz. The AE sensors were \nattached to the overhang bearing and the oil bath using superglue and connected to \nvariable gain preamplifiers 20, 40, and 60dB which were in turn connected to a \nruggedized PC, containing Physical Acoustics Corporation PCI-2 acquisition cards. \nThe preamplifiers were set at a gain of 40dB. The software (signal processing package \n\u201cAEWIN\u201d) was incorporated within the PC to monitor AE parameters such as counts, \namplitude and absolute energy (recorded at a time constant of 10 ms and sampling \nrate of 100 Hz). The absolute energy (atto-joules - 10-18 joules),  is a measure of the \ntrue energy and is derived from the integral of the squared voltage signal divided by \nthe reference resistance (10 k-ohms) over the duration of the AE signal.  In addition, \ntraditional AE parameters such as counts, amplitude and ASL were also measured. \nThe ASL is a measure of the continuously varying and averaged value of the \namplitude of the AE signal in decibels (dB). The ASL is calculated from the r.m.s \nmeasurement and is given as:- \n \n( ) ( )10ASL dB =20 x Log 1.4 x r.m.s in mV\/100    [1] \nThe traditional parameters were calculated over an AE event duration of 1500 \u00b5sec \nand a threshold of 40dB. The threshold value was set at approximately 3dB above \noperational background noise of the shaft. The system was also continuously set to \nacquire AE waveforms at a sampling rate of 2 MHz.  \n \n4 Results and Discussion \n \nTest shafts were tested until complete fracture prior to which the crack was visually \nobservable. The shaft material properties, the stress range, and the crack size govern \nthe crack propagation rate. One of the key factors that can affect the crack growth rate \nis the stress at the crack tip. When fracture occurs, the crack will initiate and \npropagate through the material. It should be noted that the lower stress levels crack \ninitiation and constitutes the majority of the life time before fracture whilst higher \nstress tends to favour a much short initiation period but a longer crack propagation \nduration. Under normal conditions of load, shaft material properties, rotational speed \nand good alignment, it is expected that cracks will be initiated in the vicinity of the \nnotch, where sharp change in cross-sectional area of the shaft was designed, due to the \nhigh stress concentration on that site. These cracks will be detected by the AE sensors. \nFor this particular paper two experimental cases are presented that reflect the general \nobservations associated with other experimental tests at loads 4kN and 8kN. Case I is \nfor a load condition of 4kN whilst Case II presents results for a test load of 8kN. \n4.1   Case I \nThe test rig rotational speed was 72 rpm and radial load of 4kN was employed for this \nparticular test. Observations of continuous monitoring of the AE levels, in addition to \ntraditional AE parameters, for 570-mins of shaft operation are presented in figures 2 \nand 3. The test terminated on fracture of the shaft (570mins). Relatively high levels of \nAE activity were noted between 95- and 130-mins of operation. After 130-mins \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n 4 \noperation the level of AE reduced to that prior to the increased AE activity at 95-mins, \nsee figure 2. It was also observed that at approximately 440-mins into the test AE \nshowed significant increase in AE energy levels until the test was terminated (570-\nmins). Figure 3 shows trends of traditional AE parameters all of which show \nsignificant increase in AE activity from 430-mins of operation. It is also worth noting \nthat relatively high levels of AE parameters (Counts, ASL and Amplitude) at 95-mins \nof operation were noted, particular the activity associated with AE counts.  \n \nInterestingly observations of the AE waveform, sampled at 2MHz showed changing \ncharacteristics as a function of time. This is presented in figures 4 and 5 where a \ntypical high transient nature of the waveform of AE events was noted after 100-mins \nof operation. It is also particularly interesting to note that the AE waveforms after \n130-mins of operation did not show any high amplitude transient AE activity. \nBetween 400- to 500-mins of operations high AE transient bursts were again noted \nuntil the test was terminated, see figure 5. On termination of the test (570-mins) a \nvisual inspection revealed a fatigue had occurred at the location of V-Notched \nsurface, see figure 10. Also visually observed was the opening and closing of the \ncrack prior to fracture. This movement, which also causes rubbing of the cracked face, \nresults in high AE activity as noted after 456-mins of testing. The authors believe that \nincreased AE activity between 95- to 130-mins is attributed to crack initiation and the \nlarge transient AE events towards the end of the tests are due to the rapid propagation, \nshearing and rubbing of the cracked face. \n \n \n \nFigure 2  Shaft test results; run to failure. \n \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n 5 \n \nFigure 3  Classical AE parameters of counts, amplitude and ASL. \n \n \nFigure 4  AE waveforms at 50, 100 and 150 minutes associated with results \npresented in figure 2. \n \n \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n 6 \n \n \nFigure 5  AE waveforms at 300, 400 and 500 minutes associated with results \npresented in figure 2. \n4.2   Case II \n \nThe applied load on this test shaft was 8kN. It is worth mentioning that this case \npresents different trends to that noted in the earlier case. Observations of continuous \nmonitoring of the AE levels, in addition to classical AE parameters, for 130-mins of \nshaft operation did not show any considerable rise early during testing. During the \nstart of the test steady AE activity was noted. Figure 6 shows the results for the test \nrun until damage was visible; approximately 130-mins of operation. Following the \nrun-in, the measured AE energy remained constant. After approximately 80-mins a \nlarge transient rise in AE energy level was observed and this AE activity gradually \nincreased after 90-mins until the test was terminated. The increase in AE energy \nlevels from earlier in the test to the condition of the observable damage was in the \norder of 34,900%.  \n \nAs in the previous case the classical AE parameters recorded over the duration of the \ntest is detailed in figure 7, where it was noted that high levels of AE activity were \nobserved at the end of the test; also observed was the opening and closing of the \ncrack. Also noted on the AE waveforms at 100-mins operation was the high transient \nnature of the waveform. Again clearly showing AE transient events, which grew in \namplitude as the test progressed with time, eventually developing very high transient \nnature of AE events at the end of the test (130-mins), see figures 8 and 9. A very \ninteresting observation of AE waveform (figure 9, 120-mis) shows much larger \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n 7 \nduration AE signals which are typically associated with rubbing of mating \ncomponents. This reinforced the visual observation of the opening and closing of \ncrack as this will cause rubbing of the cracked face. The damage observed for this test \nconditions is presented in figure 10.  \n \n \nFigure 6  Shaft test results; run to failure. \n \n \nFigure 7  Classical AE parameters of counts, amplitude and ASL. \n \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n 8 \n \nFigure 8  AE waveforms at 40, 60 and 80 minutes associated with results \npresented in figure 6. \n \n \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n 9 \n \nFigure 9  AE waveforms at 100, 110 and 120 minutes associated with results \npresented in figure 6. \n \n \n \nFigure 10  Observed fatigue associated with case I and case II. \n \nThe observations of AE for cases I and II show very different characteristics. Firstly, \nin case I, where the load is half that applied in case II, the relatively early AE activity \n(95- to 130-mins) was attributed to crack initiation. As the crack propagates \nimmediately after initiation, it is very plausible that AE would have been generated \nbut not at the same intensity and energy levels as noted at the initiation stage. As such \nthe observations of AE between 130-mins to 450-mins were of relatively low level \nuntil the crack propagation accelerated to final fracture. In case I, the crack had \ninitiated at V-Notch edges (after 95-mins into testing) eventually leading to a rapid \nrise in AE until failure of the shaft (456- to 570-mins); the duration between  initiation \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n 10 \nto the final crack propagation was clearly noted and lasted approximately 320-mins. \nIn case II where relatively higher load was applied there wasn\u2019t a clearly defined \nregion where crack initiation can be identified and related to AE activity. This is \nattributed to the fact that the time between initiation and accelerated crack \npropagation is much less than at the lower loads, explaining the AE observation noted \nfor case II; the microscopically phase from initiation till the propagation, noted in case \nI, was not obviously observed due to higher load applied. \n \n5 Conclusion \n \nShaft run-to-failure tests under natural damage conditions were successfully \nperformed. These tests demonstrated the applicability of AE in detecting crack \ninitiation and propagation on slow speed shafts whilst in operation. The two cases \npresented are representative of other tests performed in this study. It is concluded that \nthere is a clear correlation between increasing AE energy levels and the natural \npropagation and formation of shaft defects. The study has also demonstrated that AE \nparameters such as counts, amplitude and ASL are reliable, robust and sensitive to the \ndetection of natural incipient cracks and surface damages in slow speed shaft. This \nwork is the first known attempt at correlating AE activity and natural defect \ngeneration in slow speed rotating shafts and it is also the first known attempt at \nmonitoring the mechanical integrity of rotating shafts. \n \n6 References \n \n1 Jamaludin, N.; Mba, D.; Bannister, R., H., Condition Monitoring of \nSlow-Speed Rolling Element Bearings Using Stress Waves, \nProceedings of the IMECHE Part E Journal of Process Mechanical \nEngineering, Volume 215, Number 4, 1 November 2001, pp. 245-\n271(27), Publisher: Professional Engineering Publishing. \n \n2 Mba, D.; Rao, Raj, B., K., N., Development of Acoustic Emission \nTechnology for Condition Monitoring and Diagnosis of Rotating \nMachines: Bearings, Pumps, Gearboxes, Engines, and Rotating \nStructures.
