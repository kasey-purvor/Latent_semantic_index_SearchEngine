Further work is discussed, which will use a\nmulti-strategy basic algebra tutor to assess the effect of matching teaching strategy to learning style.\nIntroduction\nWhile the need to adapt teaching to the needs of a student is generally acknowledged (see\nCorno and Snow, 1986, for a wide review of the literature), little is known about the\nimpact of individual learner-differences on the quality of learning attained within\ncomputer-based learning environments (CBLEs). What evidence there is appears to\nsupport the notion that individual differences have implications for the degree of success\nor failure experienced by students (Ford and Ford, 1992) and by trainee end-users of\nsoftware packages (Bostrom et al, 1990). The problem is to identify the way in which\nspecific individual characteristics of a student interact with particular features of a CBLE,\nand how the interaction affects the quality of the resultant learning. Teaching in a CBLE\nis likely to require a subset of teaching strategies different from that subset appropriate to\nmore traditional environments, and the use of a machine may elicit different behaviours\nfrom those normally arising in a classroom context.\nOf the candidate-factors influencing learning - like personality, motivation, cognitive\nstyle, level of ability, and learning style - it is the last that we consider here. For this work,\n53\nAnne Groat and Tim Musson Learning styles: individualizing computer-based learning environments\nlearning style is defined as a preference for processing information in a particular way\nwhen carrying out a learning activity; it is the observable behaviour that arises from a\nperson's underlying personality, motivation, cognitive style and ability, and which is\nstable over a variety of situations. There is some disagreement about the stability, and\ntherefore usefulness, of learning style. For example, Entwistle (1988), Pask (1976) and\nSchmeck (1983) argue that individual students tend to be consistent in their approach to\nlearning, but on the other hand Laurillard (1984) and Ramsden (1979) consider that a\nstudent's perception of a particular situation is of overriding importance in influencing\nwhat and how a student learns. The position adopted here is that each student's approach\nto learning is determined both by a relatively stable entity called learning style, and by\nmore situation-specific concerns.\nDetermining learning style\nThere are two basic approaches to modelling a student's learning style for use within a\nCBLE. It can be done dynamically during the course of a tutorial session. For the\nstudent, this has the advantage of being non-intrusive, but it is expensive in terms of\nsystem resources, and it is unlikely that a student would use a small tutoring system for\nlong enough to enable it to infer what learning style is being used. An alternative is to\nmodel the student's behaviour by using stereotypes. For a small system this is a\npotentially useful approach that can substantially simplify the problem of modelling a\nstudent. The main disadvantage is that it requires the student to answer questions before\nstarting work, and so runs the risk of alienating its target audience. The aim should be,\ntherefore, to ask as few questions as possible, choosing those with good predictive power.\nThe most radical approach is to ask only one question. This has been explored to some\nextent by Ford (1985) and by Clarke (1993). In each case, Ford's Study Preference\nQuestionnaire was administered to a group of postgraduate students. One item was\nidentified that differentiated, at an acceptable level of significance, between students on\nthe holist\/serialist dimension. The problem is that each attempt identified a different item,\na result that Clarke attributed either to the interference arising from the reliability\nanalysis or to sample characteristics. Whatever the reason, it highlights the difficulty of\nobtaining a reasonable balance between predictive value and user acceptability.\nAcceptance of a time-consuming procedure might be enhanced if the investment of time\nand effort on the student's part was made worthwhile. Knowing what one's learning style\nis can be shown to be beneficial not only within computer-based learning environments,\nbut also in the wider educational context. Knowledge about how one learns has been\nshown to lead to more effective learning (Pennell, 1985).\nThe instrument that was chosen to assess learning style is based on Kolb's experiential\ntheory of learning (Kolb, 1984). This theory considers that learning is more than just a\ncognitive process; it is a series of experiences that involve cognition, and the learner is\nseen as moving iteratively through four stages. There are, however, problems with Kolb's\nLearning Styles Inventory (LSI): with the psychometrics (Freedman and Stumpf, 1978)\nand with the construct and face validity (Wilson, 1986). Although the underlying theory is\nconsidered helpful, the shortcomings of the LSI prompted Honey and Mumford (1986) to\ndevise a questionnaire for measuring learning style. Their Learning Styles Questionnaire\n(LSQ) is based on self-reported behaviour, and their learning styles differ in some respects\n54\nVolume 3 Number 2\nfrom Kolb's. The problem that triggered this investigation was how best to provide adults\nreturning to higher education with the basic skills in algebra to enable them to pursue\ntheir studies successfully. Such people are likely to have spent a number of years outside\nformal education. We can therefore make no assumptions about their knowledge of their\nown study habits, and a questionnaire that refers directly to behaviour in an academic\nsetting is not likely to be useful. Because the LSQ asks about behaviour and beliefs in the\nworkplace, in particular within a managerial context, it was considered that it would be\nmore meaningful to the target population.\nThe Learning Styles Questionnaire\nThe LSQ consists of 80 items which the respondent is required to check either positively\nor negatively. There is no time limit for completing it and the respondent is assured that\nthere are no 'right' or 'wrong' answers. The questionnaire seeks to identify general trends,\nand so gives equal weight to all answers; no one answer has more significance than any\nother. Most of the questions are concerned with a person's normal behaviour in an\ninformation-processing and decision-making environment, for example:\n\/ thrive on the challenge of tackling something new and different,\nlam careful not to jump to conclusions too quickly.\nI like to relate my actions to a general principle,\nlam keen to try things out to see if they work in practice.\nBut a few are concerned with beliefs, for example:\nIt is more important to enjoy the present moment than to think about the past or future.\nI believe that rational, logical thinking should win the day.\nOn completion, the questionnaire is scored, the respondent is provided with the result and\nis given the information necessary for its interpretation. Four learning styles are\nidentified. These are Activist, Reflector, Theorist, and Pragmatist. Activists want to learn\nsomething new, like immediate involvement in activities, and enjoy the challenge of\nproblem-solving. Reflectors prefer to gather and assimilate as much information as they\ncan from as many sources as possible, and like time to consider; they do not like to\ncommit themselves to a course of action before they are ready. Theorists like to explore\ncomplex ideas and concepts, and prefer to use their observations and experiences to build\ntheir own models and theories. Pragmatists want to learn techniques, and like to practise\nand experiment; they prefer to address real-world problems.\nThe authors have documented the reliability of the questionnaire, and while they admit\nthat its construct validity is difficult to prove, they claim its face validity has rarely been\nquestioned by those who have completed it. Allinson and Hayes (1988), however, failed to\nfind evidence to support the construct validity of the four factors identified by Honey and\nMumford. Instead, they distinguished two factors which they called Analysis and Action,\nand which they considered to be statistically justifiable. Their subject population was\ndrawn mostly from managers in the civil service and public enterprises, and this may have\nreduced the range of likely behaviours. Doubts have been cast upon the questionnaire's\nss\nAnne Groat and Tim Musson Learning styles: individualizing computer-based learning environments\npredictive value by Allinson and Hayes (1988) and by Fung et al (1993). In both cases,\nhowever, there are problems with the interpretation of the data. In the work of Allinson\nand Hayes, the correlation between the scores on the questionnaire and the students'\nresults (from both examinations and project work) did not reach significance. They\nattribute this, at least in part, to inconsistencies in the assessment procedures. In the work\nof Fung et al, the students were asked to rate their preferences for items presented in a list\nof learning activities; in other words, actual student performance was not assessed.\nNeither of these studies provides grounds for rejecting the LSQ as a useful indicator of\nlearning style. All that can be inferred is that we must use it with caution until more is\nknown about its effectiveness. Computer-based learning environments have the potential\nto address the issue of consistency in assessment. Once the assessment process is devised,\nit is the same for everyone; the effects of variation in assessor behaviour are eliminated.\nThe nature of the assessment process may, of course, favour some learning styles over\nothers. This may or may not be desirable, but the issue highlights another reason for\nattending to learning style. The relationship between assessment design and learning style\ncan be made explicit, and decisions about assessment procedures are therefore available\nfor scrutiny.\nFrom learning styles to teaching strategies\nEmpirical work in the classroom has indicated that effective instructional design requires\nknowledge of how people learn (van der Veer and Beishuizen, 1986; Bernaert, 1978,\nreported in van der Veer and Beishuizen, 1988). The work of Snow (1989) on Aptitude-\nTreatment Interaction demonstrated that differences in instructional treatment\nmoderated the learning differences between learners of high and low general ability.\nOthers have made a strong case for adapting teaching to learner needs over a range of\ncognitive and personality styles (Ash, 1986; Corno and Snow, 1986), and, using a\ncomputer-based task, Ambardar (1984) demonstrated significant differences in search\nbehaviour between field-dependent and field-independent types. The converse, that\npreferred learning style has a decisive influence on what people choose to learn, has been\nobserved. There is a tendency for people to select for study at college level those subjects\nthat fit with their learning style (Witkin et al, 1977; Entwistle, 1988).\nHow can the learning styles identified by the LSQ be used to generate teaching strategies?\nOf the key aspects of the learning styles described by Honey and Mumford, two can form\northogonal, bi-polar dimensions. One dimension has at one extreme the preference for\ndealing in the concrete, a need to link the domain material with real-life experiences; and\nat the other the preference for dealing in the abstract, for symbolic manipulation and\nmaking links within the domain. This distinction has been proposed by Gregorc (1979),\nand as 'visual' versus 'verbal' thinking by Stenning et al (in press). On this basis, Activists\nand Pragmatists prefer the concrete, and Reflectors and Theorists prefer the abstract.\nThe other dimension is concerned with the challenge\/safety dichotomy. Recent work\n(Newstead, 1989; Stenning and Cox, personal communication to the authors of this\npaper) has demonstrated marked differences in behaviour, called 'rashness' and\n'hesitancy', along what appears to be a similar dimension. Compared to the previous\ndimension, this one is more difficult to interpret, and possibly also to implement. Honey\nand Mumford suggest that Activists and Theorists tend to seek challenge, whereas the\n56\nALT-J Volume 3 Number 2\nother two learning styles prefer safety. Pragmatists prefer to be shown what to do and be\ngiven ample opportunity to practise, and Reflectors work best when given sufficient\ninformation to assimilate and time to reflect upon it.\nThe learning styles can be placed on a graph formed by the intersection of the two axes\n(Figure 1). Consideration of the graph can be used to define appropriate teaching\nstrategies thus:\nFigure I: Learning styles\nConcrete\nPr\nSafety\nRe\nAc\nChallenge\nTh\nAbstract\nPr = Pragmatist\nTh = Theorist\nRe = Reflector\nAc a Activist\nConcrete versus Abstract\nThe choice of graphical or textual representation of a concept has implications for the\nway it is processed and communicated. Graphics enforce specificity, or at least restrict the\nlevel of abstraction possible, whereas text enables expression of abstract ideas (Stenning\nand Oberlander, in press). Perceptual and spatial relationships are better depicted by\ngraphics, logical and temporal relationships by text (Larkin and Simon, 1987). The\npreference of learners for concrete or abstract processing, and for attending to\nrelationships they find meaningful, can be addressed by providing either a graphical or a\ntext-based environment.\nSafety versus Challenge\n'Safety' can be provided by a highly structured environment, one that teaches the subject-\nmatter in small incremental steps, and which provides ample opportunity either for\nobserving what is to be done (Reflector), or for putting into practice what has been\ndemonstrated (Pragmatist). Meta-information for the learner can consist of what has\nbeen done and what still has to be done, but the learner is given no opportunity to alter\n57\nAnne Groat and Tim Musson Learning styles: individualizing computer-based learning environments\nthe order of events. For 'Challenge', what is required is the opportunity to attempt more\ndemanding tasks as soon as the learner wants to tackle them, whether or not a teacher (or\nCBLE) would agree. Essentially, what is happening is that the learner is free to try out a\ncourse of action, or to test a hypothesis; in other words, to experiment in whatever way\nsuits. The learning environment should, of course, allow back-tracking when the step\ntaken proves to be too large. This implies that the learner should have complete control\nover the learning environment.\nDesigning the system\nOnce the teaching strategies have been derived from the learning styles, they have to be\ntranslated into teaching methods that are possible in a CBLE, at a level of granularity\nsuitable for the design and implementation of a system. Chen (1993, pp. 299-300) has\ndeveloped a methodology for classifying pedagogical methods, most of which are\napplicable to a small system. Such methods can provide the basis for designing the\nlearning environment, and for analysing user actions. Her basic pedagogical methods,\nwith some minor adaptations, are:\n1. setting goals: the knowledge or skills the learner is expected to acquire during the\nlesson;\n2. providing instructions: uninterrupted presentations of any type of knowledge through\ntext;\n3. providing demonstrations: illustration of a particular task, a worked example;\n4. providing explanations: the rationale behind a particular action;\n5. presenting tasks: activities presented through text or graphical representations;\n6. asking questions: questions requiring specific answers are presented;\n7. providing working spaces: opportunities to interact with the program, the learner\nbeing able perform a task only when a corresponding working space is provided;\n8. providing examples: the designer relates a learner's daily experience to the present\nlearning;\n9. providing reminders: the designer presents key words, such as commands, or key\nconcepts, that a learner needs during the performance of a task;\n10. providing hints: implicit cues are embedded in the task to be performed;\n11. providing evaluation and feedback: the learner's performance is evaluated and\nfeedback is provided accordingly.\nImplementation of all of the pedagogical methods is possible within the proposed system,\nand each is relevant to one or more of the learning styles. All teaching strategies will have\nrelevant goals set and stated, and appropriate evaluation and feedback provided; tasks\nwill be presented and workspace will be provided. Thus each learning style will be\ntargeted with a teaching strategy consisting of the core pedagogical methods (those\nconcerned with goals and feedback possibly implemented differently to match learning\nstyle), with different combinations of the others.\n58\nALT-] Volume 3 Number 2\nFor the 'concrete' strategies (Pragmatist and Activist learning styles), graphics will\nprovide the medium of instruction (where the use of graphics will explicitly link the\nmaterial to be learned with examples from the everyday world of experience), and for the\n'abstract' strategies (Theorist and Reflector) text directly relating to symbolic\nmanipulation will be used. For 'safety' strategies (Pragmatist and Reflector), a tightly\nstructured environment will be provided, and for the 'challenge' strategies (Activist and\nTheorist), no structure will be imposed. Instead information about the contents of the\nsystem, and recommendations about what might be an appropriate activity, will be\navailable.\nEach teaching strategy will require its own particular subset of the pedagogical methods.\nThe teaching strategies for each of the learning styles are as follows:\nConcrete-safety learners will have graphical examples and demonstrations provided, to tie\nin with the need to learn how to do things. Only after students have been shown how to\ndo a task will they be given the opportunity to perform similar tasks for themselves.\nConcrete-challenge learners will also have the material presented in graphical form, to\nallow opportunities for direct hands-on experimentation. These students will be given no\nexplicit instructions; instead, tasks will be so presented that hints about what to do will be\nembedded in the material. Information about the content and organization of the system\nwill be provided graphically.\nAbstract-safety learners will be text-based, and instructions, demonstrations, and\nreminders will be given before students are required to carry out a task.\nAbstract-challenge learners will also be text-based and, within an unstructured\nenvironment, students will have access to explanations and instructions. They will be\nprovided with textual information on the content and organization of the system.\nFigure 2: Teaching strategies\nGraphics\nProvide demonstrations\nProvide examples\nStructure\nProvide Instructions\nProvide explanations\nprovide reminders\nProvide hints\nPresent Information about\nstructure and content\ngraphically\nFreedom\nProvide explanations\nProvide instructions\nPresent information about\nstructure and content\ntextually\nText\n59\nAnne Groat and Tim Musson Learning styles: individualizing computer-based learning environments\nThe pedagogical methods can be placed on a graph of teaching strategies analogous to the\none above of learning styles (Figure 2).\nMulti-strategy CBLEs?\nFurther work will address two issues:\n\u2022 whether it is worthwhile to develop a CBLE with relatively independent teaching\nstrategies, that is, whether the extra effort involved in developing a multi-strategy\nCBLE is justified by improvement in student learning; and\n\u2022 to what extent the LSQ is a useful tool for measuring learning style, particularly with\nreference to its predictive validity.\nThe two issues are linked. The question is not so much whether learning style exists; most\nteachers believe so, and behave as if it were so, by adapting their teaching to the needs of\ntheir students, most noticeably in one-to-one situations. The problem is how to assess\nlearning style. The identification and measurement of useful learning styles are critical to\nthe development of the teaching strategies in a CBLE. Honey and Mumford's LSQ is a\ncandidate, despite the doubts about its predictive validity and concern about its length.\nFactor analysis of the individual items rather than of the sub-scales has been suggested by\nAllinson and Hayes (1990); this can address questions about both predictive validity and\nlength.\nWhile the algebra tutor is being developed, a pilot study is planned. The LSQ will be\nadministered to first-year students so that the correlation between the questionnaire items\nand the students' progress (in terms of course choice and measures of success, for example\ncourses passed and qualifications - if any - obtained) can be considered. The relationship\nbetween learning style and teaching strategies will be examined in a more controlled\nmanner using the algebra tutor which will present the same subject matter differently\naccording to the four teaching strategies. Using a four-by-four within-groups\nexperimental paradigm, the effect of the teaching strategies on each learning style will be\nassessed. It is hoped that analysis of both field and experimental data will provide some\ninsight into the difficulties and benefits of developing a multi-strategy CBLE, and also\nhelp to determine whether refinement of the LSQ should be pursued.\nReferences\nAllinson, C.W. and Hayes, J.
