Res. Lett. 3 (2008) 044002 J I House et al\nprevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate\nsystem\u2019. What constitutes \u2018dangerous\u2019 climate change is\ndifficult to determine and highly subjective as regional impacts,\nrate of change and ability to cope with change are highly\nvariable (Schellnhuber et al 2006). The EU has adopted a\ntarget of limiting global warming to 2 \u25e6C above pre-industrial\nlevels (European Council 2007). Some argue that this may\nalready be unachievable or undesirable due to the costs of\nmitigation. Nonetheless, efforts are being made to negotiate\ninternational targets to limit climate change.\nThe Kyoto Protocol set emissions reduction targets for\nindustrialized countries based on what could be achieved\npolitically, rather than what would be needed for a desired\noutcome (Prins and Rayner 2007). While continuing\nnegotiations seek to strengthen and extend the scope of\nKyoto, several countries and organizations have formulated\naspirational global greenhouse gas emissions goals (Weaver\net al 2007). The powerful G8 (Group of 8)6 nations in 2007\nissued a non-binding aim \u2018to at least half global emissions\nof CO2 by 2050\u2019 (G8 2007); they did not specify what the\nultimate goal was in terms of concentration or climate, or what\nshould happen after 2050.\nThe Stern Review (Stern 2006) is more explicit, stating\nthat \u2018The risks of the worst impacts of climate change\ncan be substantially reduced if greenhouse gas levels\nin the atmosphere can be stabilized between 450 and\n550 ppm CO2 equivalent. Stabilization in this range would\nrequire emissions to be at least 25% below current levels by\n2050, and perhaps much more. Ultimately, stabilisation\u2014\nat whatever level\u2014requires that annual emissions be brought\ndown to more than 80% below current levels.\u2019 The emissions\nreductions required to achieve these levels of stabilized\nconcentration were derived from results in the IPCC Third\nAssessment Report in 2001 (Prentice et al 2001). While the\n2001 model results incorporated ranges due to uncertainty in\ncarbon cycle processes, climate sensitivity to CO2 and climate\nimpacts on the carbon cycle, models have since been updated\nand in particular there has been more explicit quantification\nof the feedbacks between the carbon cycle and climate. The\nmodelled effect of climate\u2013carbon cycle feedbacks imply\nsubstantially greater impacts for a given emissions trajectory,\nor lower allowable emissions to meet a given concentration\nor temperature target (Cox et al 2000, Matthews 2006,\nFriedlingstein et al 2006, Jones et al 2006a, 2006b, Plattner\net al 2006). This paper explores the implications for the\nG8 and Stern emissions targets in terms of concentration and\ntemperature change, spanning the range of uncertainty across\nstate-of-the-art models. It also explores the implications for\nallowable emissions to achieve stabilization of atmospheric\nCO2 at 550 ppm.\n2. Carbon dioxide and long-term climate impacts\nIn this analysis we focus on carbon dioxide. CO2 currently\naccounts for about two thirds of the radiative forcing produced\n6 The Group of Eight (G8) is an international forum for the governments\nof Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom, The\nUnited States and the European Union.\nby all greenhouse gases (IPCC 2007). The contribution of\nother GHGs has commonly been expressed in terms of \u2018CO2\nequivalent\u2019 concentrations and emissions. In the latter case this\nmeans emissions are scaled relative to CO2 according to their\nglobal warming potential over a given time horizon (commonly\n100 years). However, this equivalence is not meaningful\nat other timescales because as much as a third of all CO2\nemitted remains in the atmosphere for thousands to tens of\nthousands of years; while the next most radiatively important\ngreenhouse gasses are removed over much shorter time periods\n(e.g. 12 years for methane, 114 years for nitrous oxide) (Archer\net al 1997, Archer 2005, Denman et al 2007, Forster et al\n2007). Thus in the near term, manipulation of other greenhouse\ngases such as methane can influence the pathway of global\nwarming, but in the long term it is the accumulated emissions\nof CO2 that count (Matthews 2006, Meinshausen et al 2006,\nDenman et al 2007, den Elzen et al 2007).\nThe long-term legacy of CO2 emissions is compounded\nby inertia in the climate system. Due to the mass and thermal\ncapacity of the oceans and ice, and the slowness of heat\ntransport processes, it takes a long time for the atmospheric\ntemperature to fully respond to changes in radiative forcing.\nIf CO2 concentrations were stabilized on a timescale of 100\nor so years, temperatures would still take several centuries to\nstabilize, sea level rise due to thermal expansion would take\ncenturies to millennia, and sea level rise due to ice melting\nwould take millennia (IPCC 2001). By contrast, climate policy\ntypically considers climate impacts and mitigation targets on\nthe timescale of decades up to a century.\n3. The carbon cycle, feedbacks and scientific\nuncertainty\nLess than half of the total cumulative anthropogenic CO2\nemitted due to fossil fuel burning and land use change\n(deforestation) has remained in the atmosphere, the rest has\nbeen taken up by the land and ocean (Prentice et al 2001). The\nmajor land and ocean carbon sinks active today are responsive\nto the raised atmospheric CO2 levels. The ocean sink occurs\ndue to the partial pressure difference of CO2 between the\natmosphere and ocean. CO2 dissolves in the ocean surface\nwaters and ocean circulation transfers it to depth. Plants take\nup CO2 during photosynthesis and convert it into biomass.\nPlants release CO2 during plant (autotrophic) respiration and\ndecay (heterotrophic respiration). Raised concentrations of\nCO2 stimulate additional growth in terrestrial plants (CO2\nfertilization effect), drawing down CO2 from the atmosphere in\na negative carbon cycle feedback (Prentice et al 2001, Norby\net al 2005). The magnitude and long-term persistence of\nthe CO2 fertilization effect is uncertain, and differs in model\nprojections (Friedlingstein et al 2006, Plattner et al 2006, Sitch\net al 2008). Note that since increasing CO2 levels stimulate\nCO2 uptake in the ocean and on land, these sinks will continue\nto operate as long as atmospheric CO2 concentration is rising\nand the land sink does not saturate. However, these sinks must\nboth tend to zero as a stable CO2 concentration is approached.\nThe land and ocean carbon sinks are also sensitive to\nclimate change. Warming reduces the solubility of CO2\n2\nEnviron. Res. Lett. 3 (2008) 044002 J I House et al\nFigure 1. Implications of the \u2018G8 scenario\u2019 50% global emissions reduction: the top panel shows historical and future emissions. Historical\nemissions of CO2 are from fossil fuel burning, plus net emissions from land use change (Houghton 2003). It is assumed that future emissions\nrise for a short time and are then cut until the target of 50% reductions by 2050 is reached (relative to 2007 emissions, assumed to be\n10.15 Pg C yr\u22121), with emissions maintained at this level thereafter. The middle and bottom panels show the resulting changes in\nconcentrations and temperature respectively according to HadSCCM1 box model, tuned to each of the eleven different C4MIP coupled\nclimate\u2013carbon cycle models.\nin the ocean, reducing ocean uptake (positive feedback).\nIncreasing temperatures are also likely to cause vertical\nstratification in the ocean, reducing transport to the deep\nocean (positive feedback), and affecting biological productivity\n(sign of feedback uncertain). On land, warming increases the\nrate of heterotrophic respiration (positive feedback) (Prentice\net al 2001, Knorr et al 2005). Changes in temperature\nand precipitation will have regionally specific effects on\nplant growth. For example, increasing plant growth due\nto longer growing seasons in northern high latitudes for\nmoderate temperature increases (negative feedback), and\nreducing growth due to heat stress and drought in low to\nmid-latitude regions (positive feedback). Many models have\nindicated a net positive \u2018climate\u2013carbon cycle feedback\u2019 such\nthat global warming drives a reduction in net CO2 uptake\n(e.g. Cox et al 2000, Friedlingstein et al 2006, Plattner\net al 2006, Sitch et al 2008). While the magnitude of this\nfeedback varied considerably between studies, some indicated\na very large effect that would have major implications for\nprojecting climate change impacts, or indeed for calculating\nthe level of anthropogenic emissions consistent with achieving\nstabilization targets.\nEleven state-of-art global climate models that participated\nin the IPCC (2007) assessment were coupled to carbon\ncycle models to study the magnitude of the climate\u2013carbon\ncycle feedbacks in the Coupled Climate\u2013Carbon Cycle Model\nIntercomparison Project (C4MIP) (Friedlingstein et al 2006).\nThese models incorporated a range of climate sensitivities7,\none of the key uncertainties in climate modelling (Knutti et al\n2008). The models represent a range of CO2 fertilization\nstrengths and other differences in carbon cycle processes\nreflecting uncertainty in the state of knowledge. Simulations\nwere made with the climate response incorporated, and then\nsuppressed, to isolate the responses of the modelled ocean and\nland carbon sinks to CO2 increases alone. Under a particular\nCO2 emissions scenario (IPCC SRES A2) (Nakic\u00b4enovic\u00b4 and\nSwart 2000), projected atmospheric concentration at 2100\nwas greater by 20\u2013225 ppm relative to simulations without\nclimate\u2013carbon cycle feedback. This range equates to an\nadditional temperature increase of 0.1\u20131.5 \u25e6C (Friedlingstein\net al 2006). None of the models included in the C4MIP analysis\ncombined high climate sensitivity with high climate\u2013carbon\ncycle feedbacks, which would imply even greater warming.\n7 Climate sensitivity refers to the change in the annual mean global surface\ntemperature for a given change in radiative forcing, usually referenced\nto the equilibrium change projected for a doubling of atmospheric CO2\nconcentration. It is a major uncertainty in future climate projections.\n3\nEnviron. Res. Lett. 3 (2008) 044002 J I House et al\nFigure 2. Implications of the \u2018Stern scenario 80% global emissions reduction: the top panel shows historical emissions as in figure 1. It is\nassumed that future emissions rise for a short time and are then cut until the target of 25% reductions by 2050 is reached (only half the G8\nCommitment), but then continuing at the same rate of decline until 80% cuts (relative to 2007) are achieved. Peak emissions are later and\nhigher, and the rate of subsequent reductions is slower, than in the G8 scenario.\n4. Methods summary\nIn the present analysis, a simple coupled climate\u2013carbon cycle\nmodel HadSCCM1 (Jones et al 2006a) was calibrated so\nas to emulate both the carbon cycle responses to climate\nand the climate sensitivity for the 11 fully coupled models\nparticipating in C4MIP. We used global-mean outputs from\nthese simulations to calibrate the simple model for each of the\ncoupled models. (For more information see the appendix.)\nCO2 emissions profiles were defined that provide a smooth\ntransition to the G8 and Stern emissions reductions targets.\nResults are not strongly sensitive to the detailed time course\nof the emissions cuts (Jones et al 2006b, Matthews 2006).\n5. Results\nThe \u2018G8 scenario\u2019 (figure 1) cuts current (2007) global\nemissions by 50% by 2050, with emissions then held constant\nat this target level. Atmospheric CO2 concentration continues\nto increase after 2050. By 2100 the CO2 concentration is 470 to\n590 ppm and the global-mean temperature is 1.3\u20133.1 \u25e6C above\npre-industrial levels. By 2300 CO2 concentration has risen as\nhigh as 640\u2013980 ppm, temperature has risen by 2.2\u20135.7 \u25e6C and\nboth continue to rise rapidly thereafter.\nThe \u2018Stern scenario\u2019 (figure 2) cuts emissions by 25%\nby 2050, with progressive cuts thereafter, down to 80%.\nCO2 concentrations in 2100 reach 480\u2013620 ppm with a\ncorresponding temperature change of 1.4\u20133.4 \u25e6C. These 2100\nlevels are slightly higher than the \u2018G8 scenario\u2019 as emission\nreductions happen more slowly, showing that cutting early can\nbe as important as cutting deeply for nearer term impacts.\nNevertheless, once the final target of 80% has been achieved,\nthe CO2 concentration increase after 2100 is slight, reaching\n510\u2013700 ppm by 2300 with temperature approaching, but not\nquite achieving, stabilization between 1.6 and 4.2 \u25e6C. Thus\nin the longer term it is the depth of cuts (or total cumulative\nemissions) that is more important (Matthews 2006).\nWhen emissions are set initially to follow the G8 scenario\nwith a 50% cut in emissions by 2050, but then continue on the\nsame trajectory to reach an 80% cut (not shown), a warming of\nless than 2 \u25e6C in 2100 is shown by all models.\nWhat mitigation action is necessary to achieve stabiliza-\ntion at 550 ppm (Stern\u2019s upper bound) when taking account\nof the climate\u2013carbon cycle feedback and other uncertainty\nranges across the C4MIP models? Again using the simple\nmodel to emulate all 11 C4MIP models, we calculated al-\nlowable emissions to achieve the IPCC WRE550 stabilization\npathway (Wigley et al 1996). Our analyses show that by 2100,\ncuts of up to 80% are necessary. Most models actual allow\na somewhat slower near-term decline in emissions than Stern\nproposes. The need for progressive emissions reductions in the\n4\nEnviron. Res. Lett. 3 (2008) 044002 J I House et al\nlong term however continues beyond 2100, with required cuts\nreaching 81\u201390% by 2300.\nThe results of the 550 ppm stabilization scenario runs\nare consistent with results of modelling sensitivity studies that\nvaried the size of the climate\u2013carbon cycle feedback, climate\nsensitivity and other carbon cycle processes within models\n(Matthews 2006, Jones et al 2006b, Plattner et al 2006). These\nstudies found substantial variation due to both the carbon\ncycle (e.g. CO2 fertilization) and climate sensitivity (which\ncompounds climate\u2013carbon cycle feedback uncertainty). The\nresults that the permissible emissions to achieve stabilization\nmust be substantially reduced when climate\u2013carbon cycle\nfeedbacks are included, and that to achieve stabilization at\nany level emissions must be substantially below present levels,\nare robust across a range of models and model settings. The\nrange across model emulations is similar to the ranges obtained\nby changing sensitivities to processes within models (Plattner\net al 2006). Using simplified models tuned to reproduce the\nbehaviour of more comprehensive, computationally intensive,\ncarbon cycle and climate models is a robust tool for exploring a\nrange of emissions scenarios and climate projections spanning\nthe range of model variability.\n6. Conclusions\nOn the timescale of decades to a century (the more common\ndomain of climate-based policy making), Stern\u2019s proposal of\n80% emissions cuts remains an effective near-term target on\nthe pathway to achieve stabilization of CO2 concentrations or\nclimate. This conclusion is robust despite the large uncertainty\nin the climate\u2013carbon cycle feedback. Ultimately, however,\nclimate stabilization at any level can only be achieved if net\nglobal CO2 emissions decline over centuries to the level of\npersistent natural sinks (\u00031 Pg C yr\u22121, or just a few % of\ntoday\u2019s emissions) (Archer et al 1997, Prentice et al 2001,\nCaldeira et al 2003, Archer 2005, Lenton et al 2006, Denman\net al 2007, Tyrrell et al 2007). On the timescale of centuries\nto millennia, over which the impacts of today\u2019s CO2 emissions\nare still being felt, stabilization in the presence of a non-trivial\nanthropogenic source of CO2 is only possible if this source is\nbalanced by an artificial sink (Haugen and Eide 1996, Prentice\net al 2001, Weaver et al 2007). The long-term impact of today\u2019s\nemissions brings this planetary timescale into contemporary\npolicy relevance.\nAcknowledgments\nThe contribution of JIH, ICP, WK and SEC was supported\nby the NERC QUEST programme.

Detailed methods\nThe calibration of the land component of the box model\nHadsccm1 followed Jones et al (2006b) with one extension:\nvegetation and soil carbon turnover rates now include linear\ndependence on the size of their respective carbon pools. The\ninitial values of these global-mean vegetation and soil carbon\npools, as diagnosed from the C4MIP runs, were prescribed\nas part of the calibration. The half-saturation constant for\nland net primary productivity (NPP) as a function of ambient\nCO2 concentration was estimated from the C4MIP runs without\ncarbon cycle feedback. Then the climate sensitivities of NPP\nand soil respiration could be derived from the fully coupled\nsimulations: equations (1)\u2013(3) of Jones et al (2006b). Oceanic\ndrawdown of CO2 was modelled using the impulse\u2013response\napproach of Joos et al (1996), with the depth of the mixed layer\nfitted to reproduce the trajectory of the ocean carbon sink in\neach of the C4MIP models (see appendix of Huntingford et al\n2004). Global warming due to CO2 increase was defined in\nterms of an equilibrium climate sensitivity, T2CO2 and oceanic\nthermal capacity cp. T2CO2 was estimated by calibration against\nC4MIP model outputs, except for the UMD model where the\nwarming constraint was not sufficient to yield a single well-\ndefined value and a value was adopted from the published\nliterature.\nReferences\nArcher D 2005 Fate of fossil fuel CO2 in geologic time J.
