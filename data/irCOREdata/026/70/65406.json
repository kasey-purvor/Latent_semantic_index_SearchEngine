Such caution is based on research from high income \ncountries that have generated a rapidly increasing body of literature on patient \nsatisfaction (Sitzia and Wood, 1997). The paucity of studies from low and middle \nincome countries only serves to reaffirm our lack of understanding of how satisfaction \nis constructed and the need to proceed with caution.  \n \nThis paper contributes to understanding how satisfaction is constructed and \nexpressed, drawing on a rural case study in Northeast Brazil. The paper asks why \nhigh levels of expressed satisfaction are recorded in settings where health care \nprovision is manifestly inadequate. Population satisfaction with health care provision \nwas included as one of the key outcome variables in assessments of local health \nsystem performance in Northeast Brazil (Atkinson and Haran, 2005). Analysis of the \ndeterminants of satisfaction as assessed through a household based survey (n=4600 \nwomen, clustered in 46 districts) explored the effects of both individual and district \nlevel factors. Satisfaction was assessed in relation to the most recent ill-health \nepisode within the last three months. Respondents were asked to rate satisfaction \nwith aspects of each of three stages of the use of a health facility: getting an \nappointment; the consultation; the pharmacy, when appropriate. The aspects were \ndefined as of importance to local people through prior qualitative research in three \ncase study districts and comprised waiting times, staff behaviour, communication of \n 4 \ninformation, time in the consultation, whether the person consulted was well informed \nand availability of prescribed drugs where appropriate. These scores were combined \ninto one index (Cronbach\u201fs alpha >0.8) to create the independent variable. The \nresults, published in Social Science and Medicine (Atkinson and Haran, 2005), \nidentified the leading factors associated with higher satisfaction as getting an \nappointment easily, resolving the health problem and whether the district was rural. \nThree districts, in which parallel in-depth case studies were made and which were \nalso part of the larger survey sample, similarly showed higher expressed satisfaction \nin the rural district (Table 1). At the same time, observations of health care provision \nin the rural district found a dysfunctional system in which senior health professionals \nattended erratically, if at all, ambulances were not working or unavailable and the \nhealth posts rarely open (Atkinson et al., 2000; Medeiros, 2002). The rural case study \nwas broadly typical of rural districts in the dry, interior, sert\u00e3o region of Northeast \nBrazil, and whilst health provision in other rural districts was not always so poor, the \ncase study was by no means an extreme. Why, given the evident inadequacies of \nhealth care provision in many rural districts, is expressed satisfaction in these \ndistricts so high ? This apparent paradox provoked our interest to explore further the \nissues involved in the construction and expression of satisfaction with health care \nprovision, drawing on in-depth qualitative data from our rural case study.  \n \nA review of the literature on satisfaction indicates that few generalisations can be \nmade. High levels of expressed satisfaction are generally reported but studies to \nexplain variation have limited success, accounting only for around a fifth to a quarter. \nIn exploring this variation, the determinants investigated fall into two broad \ncategories: those relating to the characteristics of the users, including wider \n 5 \ncontextual influences and those relating to the provision of health care (Crow et al., \n2002). There are very few analyses from low and middle income countries of the \nrelative importance of these categories and the conclusions are inconsistent: two \nstudies conclude that individual socio-demographic characteristics are relatively \ninsignificant compared with elements of clinical practice (Scarpacci, 1988 in Chile; \nBaltussen et al., 2002 in Burkina Faso); one argues that a broad range of factors \nfrom the wider political and cultural context have the stronger influence (Atkinson and \nHaran, 2005 in Brazil).  \n \nIndividual studies have demonstrated higher satisfaction amongst population groups \nwhich are disempowered in wider society, such as the elderly, lower socio-economic \ngroups, those with poor health status and those from disadvantaged geographic \nregions, for example highland areas in Bolivia (Gattinara et al., 1995) and our own \nstudy of rural areas in Northeast Brazil (Atkinson and Haran, 2005).  However, \nfindings across different studies build a largely inconsistent picture of key \ndeterminants with the single exception of age. Age consistently emerges as a \ndeterminant in that older people report higher levels of satisfaction than the young \n(Sitzia and Wood, 1997).  \n \nThus, the literature already indicates that the causes of satisfaction are multi-\ndimensional and highly complex, possibly verging on the idiosyncratic. They may \nalso be highly situation specific.  What is needed is far greater attention to the \nprocesses by which people construct and express satisfaction. In particular, a sound \nunderstanding of the influences on satisfaction beyond the remit or control of the \nhealth system is essential to assess whether and how user satisfaction evaluations \n 6 \nmay be meaningful and useful to health service managers. Without such insight, \nthere is little understanding of what it is that has been evaluated and, as a result, any \nreward system based on such evaluations risks being fundamentally unjust if these \nare influenced by factors beyond the control of managers or health practitioners \n(Young et al., 2000; Atkinson and Haran, 2005; Venn and Fone, 2005).  \n \n \nTheoretical treatments of the construction and expression of satisfaction with health \ncare nclude three types of explanatory model: the influence of expectation on \nexperience; the influence of contextual dynamics on evaluation; the mediating filters \nthrough which experience is processed into evaluation. These are summarised in \nFigure 1 and discussed briefly in the next section before introducing the case study of \na rural district health system in Northeast Brazil through which to explore these \ninfluences. \n \nEXPLANATORY MODELS OF SATISFACTION \n \nExpectation and Experience \nThe commonest approach to explaining satisfaction is the attractively intuitive \nsuggestion that satisfaction arises when the experience of health care provision \nmeets or exceeds expectation. There are more sophisticated versions of this simple \nstatement with respect to the balance between expectation and experience, the \ndimensions of expectation and experience and the influences on expectation but all \nhave at their heart this core relationship. The expression of high satisfaction when \nother assessments of health care suggest this is unwarranted, and the parallel \n 7 \nobservation that some studies report higher satisfaction in more disempowered \ngroups, may be explained efficiently as an artefact of low expectation (Pugh et al., \n2007). This explanatory model affords a powerful critique for simplistic applications of \nsatisfaction assessments in health systems management: high satisfaction resulting \nfrom low expectations does not necessarily reflect high performing health systems. \nSeveral criticisms have been levelled at the expectation-experience base to \nsatisfaction.  First, studies find expectation explains surprisingly little of the variation \n(Sitzia and Wood, 1997). Secondly, expression of expectations may be sensitive to \nthe research instrument but reported satisfaction less so (Peck et al., 2001). Thirdly, \nusers of health care services often express no expectations or only very vague ideas \nof what might be going to happen, approaching the coming experience with a \nrelatively open mind (Avis et al., 1997; Fitzpatrick and Hopkins, 1983). Lastly, there is \na complex relationship between expectation and experience in which prior \nexperience, directly, or by hearsay, informs expectation as much as expectation \ninforms experience and evaluation (Kravitz, 1996). Indeed, prior experience has been \ndemonstrated as a strong determinant of satisfaction in several studies (Sitzia and \nWood, 1997).  \n \nContextual Dynamics and Evaluation \nAn alternative explanatory model for unwarranted high expressions of satisfaction \nfocuses on influences affecting the expression of the evaluation. The proposal is that \nthe wider contextual dynamics in which respondents are faced with a satisfaction-\nrelated questionnaire provoke expressions of higher satisfaction than respondents \nmay feel. Such dynamics exert their influence through various pathways and are \nsummarised here drawing on Sitzia and Wood, 1997; Atkinson and Haran, 2005; \n 8 \nBernhart et al., 1999; \u00d8vretveit, 1992; Avis et al., 1997. Norms of courtesy can result \nin satisfaction being overstated. These may include a social obligation to show \nrespect for those in authority, such as health staff, a courtesy to interviewers by \nreporting what the respondent thinks they want to hear or the social \ninappropriateness of any explicit critical comment. Respondents in systems still \nimbued with a sense of grace-and-favour may express gratitude for the public \nprovision of services. Overstating satisfaction may also be a strategy for looking after \none\u201fs own interests. These include ensuring future good treatment if local health staff \nlearn of the respondent\u201fs evaluation, or if good reports increase local funding. \nRespondents may need to justify subconsciously the time and other costs invested in \ncoming to the health services. The act of being asked for an opinion itself may \nincrease the sense of satisfaction with the health services, a version of the \nHawthorne effect. Finally, respondents may simply be indifferent if there is no \nexpectation that change is likely, again most usually resulting in an expression of \nsatisfaction, albeit rather lukewarm. Exactly how the dynamics of values, concerns or \naspirations interact with the satisfaction studies will be locally, politically and culturally \nspecific. The expression of some of these processes depend on a power-distance \nbetween respondent and health system and\/or interviewer, indicating an explanation \nfor why more disadvantaged groups may express higher rates of satisfaction. Whilst \nresearch methodologies can tackle some of these issues through sensitive wording, \nplace of interview and so forth, these processes are difficult to control totally. This \nexplanatory model takes researchers towards an impasse in which evaluations of \nsatisfaction through any method, quantitative or qualitative, other than in-depth, long-\nterm engaged qualitative research seem bound to mislead.  \n \n 9 \nMediating Filters from Experience to Evaluation \nThe third explanatory model differs from the others in focussing on the processes by \nwhich people evaluate their experiences with health care. Expectation has its primary \ninfluence on experience, with a relatively uncomplicated link to expressing an \nevaluation. Contextual dynamics also treats the relationship between experience and \nevaluation as relatively uncomplicated (on the whole), but has its primary influence \non the expression of that evaluation. The concept of mediating filters problematises \nthe relationship between experience and evaluation by positing filters through which \nthe evaluation is constructed. Williams et al. (1998) argue that experience, negative \nor positive, is processed through two filters in constructing an evaluation and the \nexpressed satisfaction. These filters are duty - whether it is the job of the health \nservice and its staff to carry out certain functions, and culpability \u2013 whether the health \nservice can be blamed if it is not carrying out its duties.  \n \nThis is a powerful advance on the simplistic consumer expectation and experience \nmodel on the one hand and moves us on from the potential impasse from contextual \ndynamics on the other. Those models argue that expressed satisfaction is artificially \nelevated, in the first case because a disempowered population expects no better \nand, in the second case because a disempowered population will not express \ndissatisfaction for various reasons. In the model of mediating filters, high expressed \nsatisfaction is explained not as artefact, and therefore as misleading, but as the result \nof a constructed evaluation in which respondents exert their judgement based on \nwider sources of information.  This opens a potentially rich vein of research on the \ndetails of the filters that users put in place in different circumstances that has been \nrelatively little mined to date.  \n 10 \n \nThe paper explores expressions of satisfaction from in-depth, long-term qualitative \nfieldwork to identify the relative importance of expectations, contextual dynamics and \nmediating filters.  \n \nMETHODS \nStudy site \nThe data are drawn from a rural district health system in the dry, interior sert\u00e3o \nregion of Northeast Brazil. The population depended largely on agriculture, animal \nhusbandry and related cottage industry products as well as some employment in the \nlocal government sectors. The model of health care aimed to deliver basic curative \nand preventative care relatively nearby supported by resources to identify and \ntransport patients needing more advanced services. All neighbourhoods were served \nby Community Health Workers who delivered mother and child preventative care and \nwere the first point of contact for accessing other care. There were four health posts \nacross the district with physicians, nurses and dentists visiting on set days each \nweek. There was a small district hospital in the main town of the district and, crucial \nto the model, four ambulances to transport patients from the rural areas to the district \nhospital or to referral hospitals.  \n \nStudy methods \nThe data used in this paper are in-depth interviews made with thirty women between \nNovember, 1996 and March, 1997. These data were collected to evaluate health \ncare provision as part of a study of policy implementation. We have revisited these \ndata here as they afford the depth and breadth required for a more theoretical \n 11 \nreflection on the construction of user satisfaction.  The informants were not employed \nthrough the local health system or other local government body and resident in \nneighbourhoods away from the district centre. The field researcher visited these \nneighbourhoods several times before the interviews were conducted. She recruited \nparticipants, assisted by local leaders, on an ad hoc and snowball basis depending \non willingness and interest to be interviewed. The study was discussed to ensure \ninformed consent and confidentiality of information assured.  Interviews were taped, \nwith informant permission, and transcribed. The interview started with general \nconversation about personal history, which also facilitated comfort with the tape-\nrecorder. Participants were asked to narrate a recent experience of ill-health, where \nsuch existed, and their view of local health care. They were also engaged in more \ngeneral conversation about health care provision, local history and local political and \nsocial relations. The women were all between 25-60 years old (Table 2), the majority \nwere housewives with some small-scale income generating activities such as sewing. \nOne informant worked part-time in the local cr\u00e8che, another was involved in the local \nresidents\u201f committee. Ethical review of the proposal and field research practices was \nundertaken, and approval granted, through Durham University.  \n \nThe interviews were stored within the QSR NUD*IST software. Two options for \ncoding and analysis were considered: analysing each interview as a unit or extracting \nthemes across the interviews. We opted for the second of these approaches as best \nsuited for exploring explanatory models of influences on satisfaction within the study \nsite. The field researcher coded the data starting with broad categories of positive \nand negative evaluations and creating sub-categories from specific topics mentioned \nin the interviews.  \n 12 \n \nIn the next section, we present and discuss selected extracts from the results in order \nto assess the relevance of the three explanatory models in this rural case study.   \n \nRESULTS \nExpectation and Experience \nInformants were aware that the health care available, at the time of the study, was \ninadequate. One of the health posts had been used as a grain-store for the last two \nyears, another was only opened when the researcher asked to see inside. The other \nposts had few materials available and the physicians and other senior health staff \neither came late or not at all. In these circumstances, the ambulances became even \nmore critical for health care access, but these were often out-of-service, broken down \nwithout repair, or being used for other purposes. Participants repeatedly raised four \ntopics: lack of transport; absenteeism of senior professionals; shortages of supplies; \nattitudes of staff. Three of these related directly to the breakdown of the model for \nlocal health care provision. Transport is a critical element of this model and people \ncommented a great deal about the poor roads, the expense of private transport and, \nrelevant to this study, the difficulties in accessing one of the district ambulances,  \n \n\u201eWe have lots of problems here. Once my mother was ill and we sent someone to \nask [name] for a car. We asked [name] because she is a councillor and the \nPrefect told me to look to her in case of emergency. However, when we ask she \nusually says that she won\u201ft send the car because the roads to get here are in \nvery bad condition. That\u201fs the excuse she gave us when she didn\u201ft send the \nambulance to get my mother\u201f  (age 32) \n 13 \n \nWomen understand the model of health care but explain that it does not work as \nthe health posts have inadequate supplies and absent senior staff,  \n\u201eWhen we need something we have to go to [district centre], there is a health post \nin [local neighbourhood], but when we get there, they don\u201ft have any material\u201f \n(age 46) \n \n\u201eBut at the post they don\u201ft have the necessary material for first aid, so we go to \nthe hospital for everything\u201f  (age 33) \n \n\u201eI have been there, we always go there from round here, but these days, well, you \nget there, the physician doesn\u201ft come. (\u2026) Tuesdays, that\u201fs when the physician \nis supposed to come there (\u2026) we don\u201ft go there because we don\u201ft know if \nthere\u201fll be a physician there\u201f  (age 37) \n \nPeople go directly to the small hospital in the district centre and the majority of \nevaluative comments related to experiences at this facility. Complaints include: \nbeing turned away without a consultation, \n\u201eSometimes we are well treated, but the problem is that there is always lots of \npatients, so we have to wait and wait to be seen, then we get upset and come \nback home without anything\u201f (age 24) \n \n\u201eMany people are angry with the hospital because they go there and don\u201ft get \nany consultation. Some of them come back very upset because they don\u201ft want \nto wait so long as when they go in the morning but can\u201ft see the doctor until the \n 14 \nafternoon\u201f  (age 32) \n \nthe absenteeism of the physicians, \n\u201fWell, it\u201fs difficult for us because when a child is ill, we don\u201ft have a car to go to \nthe hospital and many times when we finally find a car, we get to the hospital and \nthere is no doctor. We have to go all the way to the hospital, sometimes by \nbicycle and once there, where is the doctor? They don\u201ft have any!\u201f  (age 30). \n \nand inadequate supplies, \n\u201eWhen I was ill they took me to [district hospital], but the hospital didn\u201ft have the \nmedicine. They received me very well, they never treated me badly, thank God! \nBut the problem is that they don\u201ft have what we need, they don\u201ft have the \nmaterial. (...) I went there but couldn\u201ft receive a heart exam because the machine \nwas broken. The day before yesterday I went to the hospital but the machine is \nstill broken. I really need it (\u2026) But whenever we go there, we don\u201ft get \nassistance because of the broken machines\u201f (age 39). \n \n\u201eI didn\u201ft like it because first of all, there are always a lot of patients, and secondly \nbecause when we get the prescription they don\u201ft have the medicine to give to us\u201f \n(age 44). \n \nThese complaints reflecting the breakdown of the system, were complemented by \ncomplaints about health staff attitudes towards the patients, \n\u201eRude to people, don\u201ft give appointments to people, you arrive there, they say \nthere aren\u201ft any more appointments (\u2026) they keep the appointments for other \n 15 \npeople and don\u201ft give them to the people who need them\u201f (age 53) \n \n\u201eThere they treat people in a very bad manner, it seems that they treat you \naccording to what you are\u201f (age 44) \n \n\u201eFor me it was never good (\u2026) because they have some staff who are very \ninconsiderate. (\u2026) To do that job, the person needs to be happy, ask what \npeople want, how they are feeling, but she doesn\u201ft do these things. I don\u201ft like \nthat hospital\u201f (age 27). \n \nLocal residents therefore often show a clear understanding of the model on which \nlocal health care is premised, an awareness of the basic building blocks of that model \nand the breakdown in the day-to-day functioning of the system. The comments \nreproduced here do not suggest that the population accepts this situation as all that \ncan be expected. Thus, the argument that a good rating by the local population of \nwhat other observers consider to be poor health care is explained by low \nexpectations is insufficient. At least, it is not explained by low expectations due to \npoor knowledge about what should be provided.  \n \nHowever, a different understanding of how expectation relates to evaluation can be \ndrawn from these results. The population knows that the system is not functioning as \nit should and so seeks other strategies. Two such strategies are found: going \nelsewhere; seeking help in negotiating the system.   \n \nA number of participants resorted to the health facilities of adjacent districts,  \n 16 \n\u201eI take my children to [adjacent district] because of the better treatment there\u201f \n(age 40). \n \n\u201emy daughter cut her eyebrow and I took her to [district hospital], we went by \nbicycle because it was serious and we didn\u201ft have time to go there first to get a \ncar. When we arrived there, the nurse couldn\u201ft do the suture (\u2026) but didn\u201ft give \nme the car to take her to [regional hospital]. Therefore, we took the bus (\u2026) \nThere they looked after her well; it is much faster there \u201f (age 27). \n \n \u201cI like the hospital in [regional centre] because when I go there they treat me \nwell, the time doesn\u201ft matter. (\u2026) no one was ever rude or arrogant to me, so for \nme it\u201fs a very good hospital (\u2026) I\u201fve also been to the hospital in [district centre] \nmany times, but when I get there the health staff are always very rude to me\u201d \n(age 46). \n \nInterview participants frequently sought assistance from local leaders to facilitate \naccess to health services, whether in the study district or elsewhere, by providing \ntransport, supplying or buying medicines and securing quick appointments. This \nsupport reflects a well-documented tradition in Latin America of clientelism \n(Eisenstadt and Roniger, 1984). Clientelism involves a vertical relationship between a \npatron and a client, in which the patron assumes responsibility for aspects of the \nclients\u201f welfare and the client reciprocates with political support. The continued \nimportance of clientelism in rural Northeast Brazil has also been described (Bursztyn, \n1985; Lemenhe, 1996; Barreira, 1999).  \n \n 17 \nDrawing on clientelistic networks resulted in praise for both the patrons and the \nhealth system,   \n\u201e[prefect] rang there, (\u2026), to the hospital, to take care of things, so it was all because \nof him that I could go there\u201f  (age 53) \n \n\u201eI didn\u201ft have any problems because this time I went to [regional hospital] with Dona \n[patron], at the [district hospital] they treat you really badly, I went and we asked for a \ntransfer from her to [regional hospital]\u201f (age 30) \n \n\u201eI had a commitment to [prefect candidate] (\u2026) because the wife took me there and \ngot me into the [private hospital]\u201f (age 39) \n \n\u201eWe ask [councillor] (\u2026) we ask him and he organises a car for us\u201f (age 33) \n \n\u201eWe go to them because it\u201fs quicker. If you come from that neighbourhood to this \ncentre, if there\u201fs no transport or if there is and you have to pay, then we go to the \npolitician\u201fs house, the politician brings us in his car, it\u201fs more practical, more \nconvenient\u201f (age 42). \n \nThe local politicians had control over the ambulances and some drug supplies to \ndistribute to their clients. Nonetheless, there were very few reports of people \nfeeling actively disadvantaged by favours given to another,  \n\u201eWhen my son was born I was very humiliated (...) the former first lady told the \ndriver that he had to get another patient to take (\u2026) together with me. She said \nthat he had to because the other patient was in pain and was going to vote for \n 18 \n[prefect candidate] (...) that he would loose the job if he didn\u201ft (...) what\u201fs the point \nif everyone can tell the drivers what to do? The ambulance should be for those in \nneed, for emergency cases\u201f (age 30).  \n \nPeople acknowledge that this route to health care is also unreliable, \n\u201eDuring the electoral period, the candidates, from both political groups, facilitate \nthings, making transport available for the population. Wherever you want to go, \nyou just have to talk to a candidate. But after the elections we don\u201ft find transport \nanymore, things come back to normal\u201f (age 43) \n \nWhere these alternative strategies succeed in gaining good health care, the \nrespondent expression of satisfaction is real; the respondent has experienced and \ndoes evaluate their health care as good. However, clientelism creates inequities and \nframes health care as a favour rather than a right.  Satisfaction in these instances \ndoes not equate to an empowered population able to voice their own wishes in \nrespect to the health care they require locally. Again this reflects an informed low \nexpectation of the system, rather than an ill-informed one, that may, perversely, \nresult in a real high satisfaction with the health care accessed.  \n \nContextual Dynamics and Evaluation \nThe implications of methodology for how respondents express negative evaluations \nhave been raised by other writers (Baron-Epel et al., 2001; Thompson and Su\u00f1ol, \n1995). The argument is that the formality and short time of engagement of a \nquestionnaire based survey results in an exaggerated level of satisfaction because of \nits insensitivity to social processes of courtesy and respect to those in authority and \n 19 \nstrategies of self-interest. The interviews for this paper were part of a longer study \nwhich aimed to minimise the more obvious influences on expressed satisfaction from \nthe contextual dynamics of the research. The field researcher had already lived in the \ndistrict for ten months before these interviews were made and residents were used to \nher presence in the district. She had no political affiliations locally nor any medical \nbackground in her training and thus, no direct role or influence within the local health \nsystem. She herself originated from a similar rural district and was able to present \nherself as more of an insider than an outsider despite her relatively high educational \nlevel. Interviews were always held in everyday spaces, most often the home, and \nwere never held in the spaces of the health system.  \n \nThese characteristics notwithstanding, the interview data indicated evidence for both \ncourtesy and respect to those in authority and strategies of self-interest. For \nexample, it was noticeable that complaints about poor health staff attitudes towards \nthe patients were directed primarily at more junior staff or administrative staff,  \n\u201e\u201cBut I can say that it\u201fs more the junior professionals than the physicians. They were \nvery rude to me and arrogant. Lots of people from this community say the same \nthing\u201f (age 39). \n \nWhilst this may reflect that they are the first point of contact, it is likely that this also \nreflects a contextual and cultural expression of showing respect to those in positions \nof higher authority, such as the physicians.  Sequences in interviews also show a \nreluctance to say explicitly that services are poor, although subsequent information \nindicates that there are problems,  \n 20 \nInformant: \u201ethe hospital here, it\u201fs\u2026.more,\u2026I think so-so, huh? I think the treatment \nthere is so-so\u201f  \nInterviewer: \u201eso-so, how do you mean? Good, bad, how is it ?\u201f \nInformant: \u201eI think that it is good\u2026.it\u201fs good but it needs better treatments, yeah, so it \ncan improve, we hope that it will improve\u201f (age 33). \n \nA few informants indicated that it was not in their interests to complain about the local \nhealth services,  \n\u201eI\u201fm not going to say anything about the hospital here, because even if I say \nsomething bad about the hospital, where else am I going to take people (laughs) if \nthere\u201fs only this one (laughs)? Whether it\u201fs good or bad, I have to be thankful for it, \ndon\u201ft I. .. there are problems that we see, but it doesn\u201ft do to talk about that (the \nhospital) which is the only one we have\u201f (age 35). \n \nThere is evidence, then, that these processes are at work and are likely to elevate \nratings of satisfaction. The short sequence from an interview above indicates how, \nwhen pushed for a definite answer as to whether the services are good or bad, \nselects good, despite reservations. The interesting point here is not just that surveys \nwill inevitably suffer from some of these biases, but that data from in-depth, \nqualitative interviews cannot discount the influence either.  \n \nMediating Filters from Experience to Evaluation \nInformants did demonstrate the operation of the filter relating to culpability, but not \nthat of duty. Although the health care was poor, informants excused the health staff, \nusually on the grounds that they were working in a seriously under-resourced \n 21 \nsystem, and evaluated the health care as satisfactory given the constraints staff were \nworking under, \n\u201e\u2026 the health post at [name], I went there, people are made welcome when you get \nthere, apart from\u2026.in this time of crisis\u2026it was really bad, the prefect doesn\u201ft help \nmuch, but they [the health staff] are doing what they can\u201f (age 32). \n \n\u201eI like the hospital, I haven\u201ft anything to say against it, the staff working there are \nattentive to us, it\u201fs just that they don\u201ft have many resources, this is what we know \nthat they don\u201ft have anything\u201f (age 60).  \n \n\u201eIt was a bit slow at the hospital (\u2026) I went to the physician, the physician sent me to \ndo some tests, the laboratory wasn\u201ft functioning...the machine to make the \ncardiogram of the heart also wasn\u201ft working, I don\u201ft know if it is now, but here is the \ndifficulty (\u2026)  it\u201fs the prefect who ought to maintain this, it\u201fs the prefect, so I think that \nwas his fault\u201f (age 37). \n \nThis filter, moderating the culpability of health staff in providing poor services, \noverlaps, in part, our category of informed expectation, in that informants are aware \nof how the services are capable of functioning from previous experiences when the \nsituation was better, but here this is moderated through an explanation of why this \ndysfunction has come about, an explanation that does not hold the health staff \nresponsible, but rather the local government.  \n \nThe study identified a further mediating filter, that of time-frame. Change in the \nprovision of local services over time is recognised as a potential confounder in \n 22 \nsatisfaction surveys, and the usual procedure is to solicit evaluation relating to a \nrecent ill-health episode. If, however, time operates as a mediating filter, the \nexpression of satisfaction with this recent ill-health episode is, in part, mediated by \nawareness of medium- and long-term trends in health and health care locally. Older \ninformants in this study, although critical of current provision of health care, referred \nto a time-frame of up to thirty years, over which there had been huge improvements \nin health care provision and health outcomes in the municipality. Even if the health \nfacilities do not always function well, their very existence where previously there had \nbeen nothing is viewed positively, \n \n\u201eOne thing which has got better in these last years (\u2026) was that the hospital came to \nhave physicians almost every. Despite having those problems, those physicians who \ndidn\u201ft turn up, or come whichever day they want and do what they want. But they do \nhave a physician. The number of physicians has risen you know. At the hospital. Also \nthere are others who go into the localities\u201f (age 50). \n \n\u201eIt\u201fs changed, because in my time, no-one came, today a woman who is pregnant \nstarts to go to the doctors, we didn\u201ft have this for a start. And now they have, and \nwhen it\u201fs time to go to the maternity, there\u201fs everything. In my time there wasn\u201ft \nanything, you would start to suffer, labour and then, if the labour was complicated, it \nwas very difficult\u201f  (age 57). \n \n\u201eIt was the time when many children died, as soon as children were born, they\u201fd get \nillnesses such as diarrhoea, many died from this, many little ones. I think that it\u201fs \nbecause in this time they didn\u201ft have this business of hospital, there wasn\u201ft a health \n 23 \npost, there were no vaccinations, there wasn\u201ft anything, but today there are many \ngood things for the children, children already have a vaccination in the first month \nafter being born, get vaccinations, if they\u201fre ill there are medicines, a place to take \nthem, there\u201fs the hospital to take them to, very different from the past, because in the \npast they died, when a child was born, there was nowhere to take them\u2026\u201f (age 53). \n \nAnd whilst the current situation is not good, people of all ages can remember times in \nthe more recent past when the model of health care has functioned properly,   \n\u201esometimes it\u201fs not good, no, mainly at this time when.. it\u201fs not good, but when it is \nworking well, we get good care\u201f (age 37). \n \n\u201ethere were other times when the physician even lived here, and with that things were \nbetter\u201f (age 36). \n \nWhilst others were less impressed by the improvements in care at the hospital, there \nwere many positive comments about the creation of the community health worker \nprogramme in local neighbourhoods, \n\u201eIt\u201fs got a lot better, after this government entered (ten+years before) (\u2026), but they \nimproved things hugely. The community health workers greatly improved things for \nthe children, for us it really got better\u201f (age 27). \n \n\u201eI think it is better now (\u2026). Before people used to come to vaccine the children \nonly once in a long while, so many children didn\u201ft get it. Now the mothers have \nthe vaccine cards and can monitor this, it doesn\u201ft occur so sporadically anymore. \nWe have the community health worker who provides information and monitors \n 24 \nthe children\u201fs vaccines and weight. In our community, there are also children who \nget free milk from the government because they have malnutrition problems. So I \nthink these things are an improvement. Of course I don\u201ft think it is perfect \nbecause the government could do more\u201f (39). \n \nMost importantly, people appreciate the improvements in health outcomes, especially \nfor children,  \n\u201eBut it\u201fs no longer how it once was, because in the old days, too many, children just \nas much as adults were ill\u201f (age 30). \n \n\u201eI think it\u201fs much better now because the state government (\u2026) put a community \nhealth worker here, so it\u201fs better for us and it\u201fs better for the children. Before lots \nof children used to die, now it has been more than a year since any children have \ndied in our community\u201f (age 27). \n \n\u201eWhat\u201fs really improved the most is the vaccination, \u2026. there in [a neighbourhood] \nthere\u201fs about five people with paralysis, today there isn\u201ft any anymore, we don\u201ft have \nthis anymore. (\u2026) Because of the antenatal care children are born in better \nconditions, healthier. (\u2026) the mothers can take them to see doctors (\u2026). I can tell \nyou, if I had had my children recently, they would all still be alive because things are \neasier (\u2026). it\u201fs not perfect, but thinking about 30 years ago, we can\u201ft even compare\u201f \n(age 60).  \n \nInformants recognised that the local health system is vulnerable to the attitude of the \nlocal government and the playing out of local politics,  \n 25 \n \n\u201eGod help us that whoever it is who gets in [prefect elections], that he doesn\u201ft behave \nlike the other one did, no, because if he does this as well, oh, us poor people \u201e (age \n30) \n \nThese data indicate that the population understands that in the short-term the \nadequacy of health care provision can fluctuate dramatically given its vulnerability to \nlocal politics. The concept of a mediating filter of a medium- to longer-time frame \nraises the possibility that in moving from experiences of health care to expressing an \nevaluation, the population looks beyond what can be seen as short-term noise of the \nimmediate experience to see the overall trend and as such expresses a higher rate of \nsatisfaction. There is overlap in this filter with that of culpability, in that the health \nsystem is not being held entirely responsible for the short-term deficiencies, but \nspecifying the importance that the reference frame of time may exert on evaluations \nis usefully drawn out as a separate element.   \n \nDISCUSSION and CONCLUSIONS \nInterview data with women in a rural district of Northeast Brazil are drawn on to \nexplore the applicability of three different explanatory models in understanding the \nprocesses causing high levels of expressed satisfaction with services that are clearly \ninadequate. Whilst we present evidence of influences that supports all three \nexplanatory models, we have also expanded the scope of those models by adding \nelements of informed expectation, clientelistic practices and time-frame.  \n \n 26 \nThe explanatory models of expectation and of contextual dynamics propose \nprocesses by which respondents fail to appreciate what a good service should look \nlike, or fail to reveal negative evaluations that they nonetheless feel for a range of \ncultural, political and cognitive reasons. In either case, the expressed level of \nsatisfaction is effectively artificial. Rural women from Northeast Brazil do demonstrate \nthe influence of contextual dynamics on their willingness to express negative \nevaluations and therefore provide evidence that the high expressed satisfaction \nfound may, in part, be artificially elevated. \n \nHowever, other evidence indicates a more complex account for the high satisfaction \nlevels. Low expectations from poor information did not emerge as an adequate \nexplanatory model. Instead, we introduce the concept of informed expectation which \ndirects potential users of the system to seek strategies by which to increase their \nchances of gaining good health care. Two overlapping strategies were identified: by-\npassing the local health system and going elsewhere; seeking assistance from a \npatron to access the resources needed to gain good health care locally or further \nafield. By mobilising these strategies, respondents may be justifiably satisfied with \nthe health care they have received and the expressions of positive evaluation are \nreal. This is satisfaction with service regardless of the means by which it was \nobtained.  Accessing health care through clientelistic networks matters for the \nempowerment of local populations in that structural inequalities in society are re-\nenacted through the health care system, a system that at least in the case of Brazil, \nhas a principle of universal access for all enshrined in the constitution. The \nsatisfaction with health care gained through clientelistic networks is, in part, derived \nfrom practices that continue to leave the population at the mercy of the goodwill of \n 27 \nthose more privileged for their health care. The measure of satisfaction with health \ncare in this case is not artificial, but may be dangerously misleading.  \n \nThe concept of mediating filters further complicates our understanding of how \nsatisfaction ratings are produced. The informants are viewed in this explanatory \nmodel as reflective beings who do not simply equate evaluation with experience but \nlocate their experiences within their knowledge of the specific context. In this study, \nwe find support for the element of culpability as a mediating filter operating such that \nthe health care provided is rated as good, considering the circumstances. We argue \nthat the reference time-frame of respondents should be introduced for further \ninvestigation as an additional mediating filter. The evidence presented here suggests \nthat informants may ignore short-term fluctuations in the provision of health care, \neven when being asked about specific episodes. Time within satisfaction surveys has \nbeen barely touched upon in the study of influences on respondents\u201f evaluations. \nThere have been methodological considerations of the need for longer-term follow\u2013\nup surveys to assess the importance of outcome on satisfaction (Avis et al., 1997). \nWe have found one study, discussing high satisfaction levels in the UK, that raises \nthe possibility that the survey instruments might be capturing something else rather \nthan satisfaction with a particular health care incident (Staniszewska and Ahmed, \n1999). Their suggestion of what that something else might be relates to ideological \ninclinations, such as expressing general support to the concept of a national health \nservice in the UK context. This represents a proposal that wider political, cultural or \nemotional factors influence how people express satisfaction. The role of time in this \nstudy shares Staniszewska and Ahmed\u201fs reflection that surveys may capture \nsomething of an attitude to the wider context rather than individual satisfaction with a \n 28 \nspecific episode of health care. However, in contrast, here the awareness of \nimprovements over a longer time frame means that expressed satisfaction with \nhealth care provision does reflect some dimensions of satisfaction with health care \nprovision.  \n \nThese findings add to the existing body of serious queries with respect to the uses \nmade of satisfaction surveys in current policy environments. The move towards the \nincorporation of relatively simple satisfaction surveys in all areas of service provision \nto compare providers has long been challenged on the grounds that much of the \ninfluence on satisfaction is beyond the providers\u201f control. This paper problematises \nthe assessment of user satisfaction further by demonstrating additional influences of \npolitical culture and of mediating filters on user satisfaction. The conclusions and \nimplications for user satisfaction surveys are seriously discomforting. First, local \nhealth systems may gain expressions of good satisfaction from their populations \nbecause of iniquitous procedures (rather than despite them); secondly, one of the \nfundamental assumptions built into satisfaction surveys, that the respondent is \nevaluating a single episode whatever the complexities of influences upon that, is \nthrown open to question.  \n \nThe evident complexity in how respondents both construct and express their \nsatisfaction with services is not only in need of further elaboration and theorisation \nthrough research but explicitly includes contextual cultural and political dynamics \nsuch as to render generalisation on the significant elements in such processes \ninappropriate. The implications should be clear. At best, user satisfaction surveys \nhave useful application as management tools only as longitudinal monitoring \n 29 \ninstruments at local scales. Cross-sectional applications aimed to compare different \nsettings capture processes far too diverse and complex to given meaningful \ninformation to managers.     \n \nAll three explanatory models contribute towards an understanding of why high \nexpressed satisfaction levels are found where health care provision is clearly poor. \nAs Figure 1 showed, the models relate to different aspects of the relationship \nbetween experience and evaluation. But there is clearly feedback between some of \nthe elements across the three explanatory models. Figure 2 presents a combined \nexplanatory model of expectation, contextual dynamics and mediating filters, \nexpands the elements with informed expectation, clientelism and time-frame, and \nindicates feedback relationships between those elements.  We conclude by \nreiterating the complex of processes, some complementing one another, some \nconflicting with one another. Further studies and reflections on the construction and \nexpression of satisfaction with health care may contribute further elements or \nelucidate their expression in different contexts, such as we have done here, and in \nthis way, we become better able to understand the complexities of the interactions \nbetween health system, health system user and health system contexts.  \n \n \n 30 \nREFERENCES \n \nAtkinson, S., Medeiros, R.L.R., Oliveira, P.H.L., & Almeida, R.D.de (2000).
