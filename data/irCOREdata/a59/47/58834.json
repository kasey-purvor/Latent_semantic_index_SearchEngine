The great 3 \nadvantage of such as approach is the inclusion of field evidence, but there are also restrictions, 4 \nsuch as the absence of explicit criteria regarding significant effects on the vegetation, and the 5 \nimpossibility to predict future impacts when N deposition changes. Model approaches can account 6 \nfor this.

There is a also a clear 17 \nneed for further testing and validation of the models against long-term monitoring or long-term 18 \nexperimental datasets and against large-scale survey data. This requires a focused data collection in 19 \nEurope, combing vegetation descriptions with variables affecting the species diversity, such as soil 20 \nacidity, nutrient status and water availability.

In Europe, N is the most 6 \nimportant air pollutant affecting plant species diversity. Evidence suggests that increasing N 7 \navailability often causes an overall decline in plant species diversity (Tilman, 1987; Bobbink et al., 8 \n1998) even at long-term low-N inputs (Clark and Tilman, 2008). In some cases, especially under 9 \nvery nutrient poor conditions, however, an increase in plant species diversity has been observed 10 \ndue to the expansion of nitrophilic species (Emmett, 2007). Effects of N deposition, either in the 11 \nform of ammonia (NH3), ammonium (NH4), nitrogen oxide (NOx) or nitrate (NO3), are now 12 \nrecognised in nearly all oligotrophic and mesotrophic (semi-)natural ecosystems. An overview of 13 \neffects on plant species diversity, including impacts on mosses, lichens and mycorrhizae, in forests, 14 \ngrasslands, heathlands, oligotrophic wetlands (mire, bog and fen), and coastal habitats, mainly in 15 \nEurope, with related empirical critical N loads, is presented in Achermann and Bobbink (2003). 16 \nMore recently , an overview of effects of N deposition on a global scale, distinguishing Arctic and 17 \nAlpine ecosystems, boreal forests, temperate forests and tropical forests, heathlands and 18 \ngrasslands, Mediterranean vegetation, tropical savannas and arid vegetation (desert and semi-19 \ndesert) is presented in Bobbink et al. (2009).  20 \n 21 \nCritical loads and their use in policy making 22 \nIn order to set standards and targets for emission reduction policy, the concept of critical load has 23 \nbeen developed. The general definition of a critical load is \u2018a quantitative estimate of an exposure 24 \nto one or more pollutants below which significant harmful effects on specified sensitive elements 25 \nWim de Vries \n 4 \nof the environment do not occur according to present knowledge\u2019 (Nilsson and Grennfelt, 1988). 1 \nCritical loads are defined for specific combinations of pollutants, effects and receptors. They 2 \nreflect spatially variable sensitivities, thus leading to regionally defined emission-reduction needs. 3 \nThe concept is most commonly used in connection with the atmospheric deposition of S and N 4 \n(acidification and eutrophication) and in these cases the critical load is the maximum flux (in kg N 5 \nha-1.yr-1 or keq H ha-1.yr-1) that an ecosystem is able to sustain. Since 1994, critical loads for N and 6 \nacidity have played an important role in European air pollution abatement (Hettelingh et al., 2001; 7 \nSpranger et al., 2008). European critical load exceedances, calculated and mapped using the latest 8 \nmethods and datasets for critical loads, deposition, and emission scenarios, are presented in 9 \nHettelingh et al. (2007) and Slootweg et al. (2007). Results show that the area where critical loads 10 \nof acidity are exceeded and will continue to decrease, even if no new legislation is implemented, 11 \nwhile high (> 10 kg N ha-1.y-1) exceedances for critical N loads remain widespread especially in 12 \nnorth-western European areas dominated by ammonia emissions.  13 \n 14 \nExceedances of the critical load of acidity and N have been used in European pollution abatement 15 \npolicy for defining emission-reduction targets, i.e. in the UNECE Convention on Long-range 16 \nTransboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP Convention) and the European Union (National Emission 17 \nCeilings Directive, 2001; EC, 2005). Integrated assessment models (e.g. the RAINS model, Amann 18 \net al., 1999) use these data and methods in scenario analyses. The exceedance of critical loads of N 19 \nis also used as an indicator for risk to biodiversity by the European Environment Agency (EEA, 20 \n2007). The general organization of effects-based European air pollution policies is described in 21 \nwww.unece.org\/env\/lrtap.  22 \n 23 \nCritical load approaches for nitrogen  used in policy making  24 \nCritical loads for N, as used in European environmental policy, are estimated empirically or by 25 \nsimulation. The empirical approach uses experimental fields or 'mesocosms' where various levels 26 \nWim de Vries \n 5 \nof N fertiliser have been added. In that case, the critical load is determined as the level of 1 \ndeposition where a decrease in biodiversity just starts to occur (Achermann and Bobbink, 2003). 2 \nThe great advantage of the use of empirical critical N loads, based on N-addition experiments, is 3 \nthat there is field and\/or experimental evidence for a relationship between N deposition and 4 \neffects. There are, however, several requirements for empirical critical N loads to be reliable, 5 \nincluding: (i) long-term experiments (preferably > 4 year) to show long-term effects and (ii) studies 6 \nin low background-N deposition areas to ensure that major effects have not already occurred. In 7 \nhigh background N deposition, high-N additions may be needed before (additional) effects show 8 \nup and N removal experiments should be used instead (Emmett, 2007). The empirical critical N 9 \nloads are thus mainly based on long-term field-addition experiments and mesocosm studies in low-10 \nN-deposition areas  with realistic N loads (<100 kg N.ha-1.yr-1). However, since such experiments 11 \nare time- and labour-intensive, results are only available for a rather limited group of broadly 12 \ndefined ecosystems. The reliability (range) in empirical critical loads, being the level of the lowest 13 \nN addition where effects occur, is mainly influenced by the chosen interval in N additions and by 14 \nan uncertain background N deposition that has to be added to this level (Sutton et al., 2003). An 15 \naspect that also limits a strict comparability is the lack of fixed criteria regarding significant effects 16 \nfor which a critical load is derived (as e.g. in critical limits for toxic substances), and it is also 17 \nimpossible to predict future impacts when N deposition and other environmental conditions 18 \nchange simultaneously. 19 \n 20 \nThe model-based critical load approach, used in European environmental policy  making, is based 21 \non an ecosystem mass balance, which balances the deposition load to an ecosystem with its long-22 \nterm capacity to buffer this input or to remove it from the system without harmful effects inside 23 \nor beyond the system (Hettelingh et al., 2001; Spranger et al., 2008). The harmful effects are 24 \ndefined in terms of critical limits above which a negative effect is assumed to occur. An overview 25 \nof those limits is given in De Vries et al. (2007). The model calculates a critical load as the 26 \nWim de Vries \n 6 \ndeposition level leading to soil conditions that are just tolerated by a given ecosystem. The model-1 \nbased critical load approach as used up to now, however, is by definition based on the sustainable 2 \nstate of a given ecosystem that is invariable in time (steady-state) and excludes non-permanent 3 \nbuffering processes such as temporary N release and retention and cation exchange. This long-4 \nterm critical load may therefore differ from the atmospheric deposition actually affecting the 5 \necosystem, since ecosystems differ in sensitivity to perturbation depending on their current state 6 \nand recent history. Nitrogen deposition thresholds may vary during forest stand development, as 7 \nfor example shown also with dynamic-model approaches (Tietema et al., 2002). These differences 8 \nform the core of resilience and sustainability theories. This aspect has not been included in model 9 \nbased critical loads until now, and their steady state concept implies that the exceedance of such 10 \ncritical loads does not allow a prognosis of ecosystem status at any point in time.  11 \n 12 \nNeed for dynamic model approaches and aim of this paper 13 \nBoth empirical critical loads and steady-state models do not allow prediction of the temporal 14 \nresponse of ecosystems to deposition scenarios, for example, in terms of impacts on plant species 15 \ndiversity. This requires the use of the dynamic integrated soil-vegetation models. Such models can 16 \nalso be used to assess critical loads, while accounting for differences in sensitivity to perturbation 17 \ndepending on their current state and recent history. In the context of ecological theory, N 18 \ndeposition is a form of disturbance; i.e. an external influence that moves the system away from its 19 \nstable state (Gunderson, 2000). If such a disturbance is not too large, the ecosystem has the ability 20 \nto return to its former state ('resilience', see e.g. Gunderson, 2000); in the case of N deposition, 21 \nthis might happen by incorporation of N in refractory soil organic material or N leaching. 22 \nHowever, if the disturbance is larger or extends over a prolonged period, the system may move 23 \ntowards an alternative stable state, from which it will not be able to return to its former state 24 \nwithout a new external influence (Ludwig et al., 1997). N deposition will ultimately stimulate the 25 \ngrowth of more productive species, that usually produce more easily degradable litter and reach a 26 \nWim de Vries \n 7 \ngreater height, thus increasing both the deposition itself, and the amount of N cycling in the 1 \nsystem. In these terms, the critical load is the highest deposition that will not cause an ecosystem 2 \nto shift to an alternative (more productive, usually species-poorer) state. In this alternative state the 3 \nquantity of N cycling through the system will be much larger than in its original state and, because 4 \nof the tight cycling of N- a return to the former, N-poor state will only be possible by physically 5 \nremoving the excess N even if deposition decreases (Wamelink et al., 2008). Critical-load 6 \nassessments including such aspects can be only be included in dynamic model approaches, 7 \nsimulating delays in damage due to buffering processes and delays in recovery due to time take to 8 \nrestore soils to its original state.  9 \n 10 \nIn this overview, we describe the possibilities of multi-species models in combination with 11 \ndynamic soil - vegetation models to (i) predict plant species composition or diversity as a function 12 \nof atmospheric N deposition and (ii) calculate critical N loads in relation to an acceptable plant 13 \nspecies diversity change. First, we present the two main model approaches that are presently 14 \nemployed in Europe: (i) a simple soil acidification and nutrient cycling model (SMART2 or 15 \nMAGIC) combined with field-based empirical relationships with plant species responses (MOVE, 16 \nGBMOVE or NTM) and (ii) a detailed, mechanistic, soil-acidification and nutrient-cycling model 17 \n(ForSAFE) with a process-based description of plant species responses (VEG). An explanation of 18 \nthe model acronyms and main features appears in Table 4 and 5. The overview includes a 19 \ndescription of each modelling approach, followed by application examples illustrating the model 20 \nvalidation status and the use of the models in critical-load assessments. In a final section we 21 \ndiscuss the potential of linked biogeochemistry-biodiversity models to support European pollution 22 \nabatement policy, including (i) strengths and weaknesses of the two major model approaches, (ii) 23 \nthe use of different indicators for N availability, (iii) the validation status of each model, (iv) the 24 \npotential of the models to assess critical loads, (v) the need for additional field surveys and (vi) 25 \nrelevant extensions to the modelling approaches. 26 \nWim de Vries \n 8 \n  1 \n2 Modelling approach  2 \nIntegrated soil-vegetation models are used at present in Europe to predict plant species 3 \ncomposition as a function of atmospheric deposition of N and acidity, as illustrated in Figure 1. 4 \nThe principle of such model-based approaches is that a dynamic soil model (SMART2, MAGIC, 5 \n(For)SAFE) predicts the changes in water and nutrient status (e.g. as N availability or C\/N ratio) 6 \nand soil acidity (e.g. as soil pH or base saturation) in response to atmospheric deposition, whereas 7 \na statistical model (NTM, MOVE) or a process-based model (SUMO, VEG) predicts vegetation 8 \nsuccession or changes in plant species composition in response to the changes in water, nutrient 9 \nand acidity status, using plant species-specific information on habitat preferences. Such coupled 10 \nmodels can be used in an inverse way to determine critical loads. In that case, critical values for 11 \nabiotic factors (e.g. N availability or soil pH ) have to be empirically determined per vegetation 12 \ntype, either directly or from information per species (step 1) and subsequently used in the coupled 13 \nsoil model (step 2) to back-calculate the critical N and acid loads.  14 \n 15 \nSimulation of critical loads according to the above principle was carried out in the Netherlands 16 \n(Van Dobben et al., 2006), where (i) the critical pH and N availability per vegetation type 17 \n(association) were determined on the basis of a large set of vegetation relev\u00e9s (vegetation 18 \ndescription of a small plot), often ,  (cf. MOVE model, Latour and Reiling, 1993), and (ii) the 19 \ndynamic soil model SMART2 (Kros et al., 1995) was used to calculate the critical loads at which 20 \nthe above critical limits were not exceeded in the long term. Other models use critical limits for 21 \nother abiotic variables, such as the C\/N ratio in the GBMOVE model (Smart et al., 2003) and the 22 \nBERN model  (Schlutow & H\u00fcbener, (2004). or the soil N, P, BC availability, soil moisture, pH, 23 \nlight and grazing pressure in the ForSafe-VEG model (Belyazid et al., 2006; Sverdrup et al., 2007).  24 \n 25 \nWim de Vries \n 9 \nBelow, we discuss the two major model approaches used at present, i.e. (i) dynamic soil models 1 \nlinked with empirical static-vegetation models (the SMART2(-SUMO)-MOVE\/NTM  and 2 \nMAGIC(-SUMO)-GBMOVE model chains) and (ii) a deterministic, dynamic ecosystem model 3 \nintegrating hydrology,  growth, biogeochemical cycles and vegetation dynamics. (ForSafe-VEG) 4 \n 5 \n2.1  Linked dynamic soil models with empirical static vegetation models 6 \nTwo major comparable model chains of dynamic soil models linked with static vegetation models 7 \nare SMART2(-SUMO)-MOVE\/NTM  and MAGIC(-SUMO)-GBMOVE, which are developed 8 \nand used in the Netherlands (NL) and the United Kingdom (UK), respectively. The model chains 9 \nconsist of: (i) the soil models SMART2 (NL) or MAGIC (UK) that simulate the cycling of 10 \nnutrients in the soil and predict soil acidity and N availability, (ii) the succession model SUMO that 11 \nsimulates the cycling of nutrients (N, P, K, Ca, Mg) in the plant-soil system, including biomass 12 \ngrowth through photosynthesis and biomass removal through management and (iii) multiple 13 \nregression equations between species presence and abiotic factors that define the realized niches of 14 \na substantial proportion of the vascular flora of each country (and in the UK also bryophytes) 15 \n(MOVE in NL and GBMOVE in UK), or of plant communities (NTM in NL). In the Dutch 16 \nMOVE and NTM models, abiotic factors are groundwater table, soil pH and N availability, 17 \nderived via Ellenberg indicator values, whereas a version of the UK GBMOVE model also 18 \nincludes three climatic variables, i.e. the minimum January temperature, maximum July 19 \ntemperature and precipitation. Ellenberg\u2019s  indicator values are classes of plants species with 20 \nsimilar ecological niches, which are derived for about 2720 central-European vascular plants 21 \n(Ellenberg et al., 1992). Ellenberg derived values for the following ecological factors: light (EL), 22 \ntemperature (ET), continentality (EK), moisture (EF), soil pH (ER), nutrients\/nitrogen (EN), and 23 \nothers (salinity, heavy metal resistance) (Esonst). SMART2 can be used both in its original, dynamic 24 \nform, allowing the calculation of target loads, and as a steady state version, allowing the calculation 25 \nof steady state critical loads, as used in policy making. The use of SUMO is optional in both model 26 \nWim de Vries \n 10 \nchains. Changes in species composition are modelled by first simulating the effects of N and S 1 \ndeposition on soil conditions followed by simulating the impacts of changed soil conditions on 2 \nspecies composition.  3 \n 4 \nModelling the relation between atmospheric deposition and soil conditions 5 \nSMART2 and MAGIC are dynamic, process-oriented models that predict changes in soil 6 \nchemistry at a given level of N and S deposition. Changes of N and S deposition on soil variables 7 \nsuch as pH, C\/N ratio or N availability by SMART2 (Kros et al., 1995; Kros, 2002) or MAGIC 8 \n(Cosby et al., 2001). Both SMART2 and MAGIC include the major hydrological and 9 \nbiogeochemical processes in the soil compartment, to calculate the long-term effects of 10 \natmospheric deposition of NOx, NHy, SOx and base cations (BC\n2+) on soil-solution chemistry, and 11 \nin case of MAGIC also the surface-water chemistry. The models have a high degree of process 12 \naggregation to minimize their data requirements, which  allows application on a regional scale. 13 \nThey consists of a set of mass-balance equations, describing the soil input-output relationships, 14 \nand a set of equations describing the rate-limited and equilibrium soil processes. Apart from pH, 15 \nthe models predict changes in aluminium, base cation, ammonium, nitrate and sulfate 16 \nconcentrations in the soil solution and solid phase. Key parameters include the input and output 17 \nfluxes of base cations and strong acid anions, the soil cation exchange capacity, and the fraction of 18 \nthis capacity that is occupied by Ca, Mg, Na and K ions. Nitrogen dynamics in MAGIC are based 19 \non empirical relationships between net N retention and the current C\/N ratio in the soil, whereas 20 \nin SMART2  litterfall, mineralization, root uptake and immobilization are modelled explicitly. Both 21 \nSMART2 and MAGIC have an internal simplified growth module which enable the models to 22 \ncalculate nutrient cycling detached from SUMO. The detached version of SMART2 has been used 23 \nfor the calculation of critical loads and target loads. For the computation of target loads, a 24 \nprocedure was developed to iteratively run SMART2 until the N and S deposition used, lead to the 25 \ncritical pH or N availability for a given vegetation type. Furthermore, a steady-state version of 26 \nWim de Vries \n 11 \nSMART2 has been developed that computes the critical N and acid load that in steady state leads 1 \nto a given combination of N availability and pH. A complete overview of these models, and the 2 \ndifferences between SMART2 model and MAGIC can be found in the various references 3 \nmentioned and in De Vries et al. (2007). 4 \n 5 \nSUMO  is a process-based model that simulates biomass growth under given soil, climate and 6 \nmanagement conditions (Wamelink, 2007). The basis of the model is a maximum growth that is 7 \nbeing reduced by a series of linear and non-linear reduction factors to constrain growth. These 8 \nreduction factors convey the effect of changes in the availability of light, N, phosphorous, water 9 \nand temperature. SUMO distinguishes five functional plant types (climax trees, pioneer trees, 10 \nshrubs, dwarf shrubs and herbs) that compete for light and nutrients. Their competitive balance is 11 \ngoverned by vegetation structure, i.e. canopy height and biomass of roots and leaves per functional 12 \ntype. Management is simulated as biomass removal by mowing, grazing, cutting or turf stripping. 13 \nThe accumulation of biomass in the five functional types determines the succession stage (e.g. 14 \npioneer, grassland, heathland, forest). SUMO can be coupled to niche models. e.g. NTM or 15 \nMOVE, through vegetation structure and soil chemical conditions (pH and nutrient availability) 16 \nsimulated by SMART2 or MAGIC. For these soil models litterfall is a crucial input term that is 17 \ngenerated by SUMO. In each time step there is feedback between SMART2 or MAGIC and 18 \nSUMO; the models exchange information about N and P, litterfall, and vegetation structure.  19 \n  20 \nRelationships between plant species occurrence and soil conditions  21 \nMOVE and NTM: The models MOVE (Latour and Reiling, 1993; Latour et al., 1994) and NTM  22 \n(Schouwenberg et al., 2000; Wamelink et al., 2003a) are based on response curves in which the 23 \nprobability of plant species (MOVE) or plant community (NTM) occurrence is determined by 24 \nvegetation structure and the abiotic site conditions of groundwater table, soil pH and N 25 \navailability. The probability of occurrence is a simple bell-shaped curve derived for 914 species by 26 \nWim de Vries \n 12 \n2nd-order logistic regression based on presence\/absence, representing species occurrence along an 1 \nenvironmental gradient. These relationships are based on the realised niche, i.e. they account for 2 \ncompetitive exclusion, rather than responses of the species in isolation. Since MOVE and NTM 3 \nfocus on more than one abiotic factor, the curves are multi-dimensional. The probabilities of 4 \noccurrence are determined per vegetation type relative to soil pH and N availability, estimated on 5 \nthe basis of Ellenberg's (1992) indicator values for N (EN) and acidity (ER). In the critical-load 6 \napproach of Van Dobben et al. (2006), the 20- and 80-percentiles of these frequency distributions 7 \nwere used as the critical limits, i.e. the range between these percentiles was considered as the 8 \noptimal range for each vegetation type.  9 \n 10 \nThe above frequency distributions were determined in a database of 160 000 vegetation relev\u00e9s 11 \nthat were labelled in terms of vegetation type (Schamin\u00e9e et al., 1989), originally developed for a 12 \nrevision of the Dutch classification of plant communities. In a separate procedure, the Ellenberg 13 \nvalues (which are on an arbitrary scale) were translated into physical units that can be used as input 14 \nto dynamic models. This translation requires a training set where vegetation and soil conditions (at 15 \nleast pH and N availability) have been recorded simultaneously. In the past few years, much effort 16 \nhas been put into the collection of such data (Wamelink et al., 2007, see www.abiotic.wur.nl). 17 \nVarious translation functions between Ellenberg values and physical units have been derived (e.g.  18 \n(Alkemade et al., 1996; Ertsen et al., 1998; Wamelink et al., 2002; Van Dobben et al., 2006). Those 19 \nof Van Dobben et al. (2006) for example run: 20 \n 21 \nRE53.01.3pH \u22c5+=  R\n2 = 0.43; n =3630 (1) 22 \n 23 \nvegtypecE64.019.6N Nav \u22c5+\u22c5+=  R\n2 = 0.24; n =6911 (2) 24 \n 25 \nWim de Vries \n 13 \nWhere Nav= N availability (kMol.ha\n-1.yr-1) and the constants c per vegetation type are -1.182 for 1 \ngrass, -1.898 for heath, -0.274 for coniferous forests and 0 for deciduous forest  2 \n 3 \nGBMOVE: As with MOVE, multiple logistic regression was used to construct empirical equations 4 \nthat predict habitat suitability for higher and lower plants representative of British plant 5 \ncommunities, based on their abundance along key environmental gradients as recorded by 6 \nextensive relev\u00e9 data (e.g. Roy et al., 2000). Each equation consists of regression coefficients that 7 \napply to either four or seven explanatory variables, depending on whether climate variables 8 \n(minimum January temperature, maximum July temperature and precipitation) are included or not. 9 \nImportant interaction terms are also included. These quantify the extent to which a species\u2019 10 \nresponse on one gradient is conditioned by another gradient (e.g. Pakeman et al., 2008). The data 11 \nused to derive each equation were assembled from a variety of sources as described in De Vries et 12 \nal. (2007) and covered more than 40 000 vegetation relev\u00e9s. The regression was based on 13 \npresence\/absence data for each plant species in each plot paired with values of climatic variables 14 \n(derived from the plot's geographical position) and plot-averaged Ellenberg indicator values. The 15 \nfinal number of species having GBMOVE regression models is 327 for bryophytes and 803 for 16 \nvascular plants in non-coastal habitats (74 in coastal habitats). 17 \n 18 \nAs with MOVE, soil pH and soil C\/N ratio are translated instantaneously into mean Ellenberg ER 19 \nand EN values respectively, using paired soil measurements and mean Ellenberg values from the 20 \nCountryside Survey 1998 database (Smart et al., 2003). The limitations of the assumption that 21 \nspecies presence immediately changes in response to soil conditions are discussed in detail in 22 \nSection 5. Relationships thus obtained are:  23 \n 24 \nNEln63.061.3)N\/Cln( \u22c5\u2212=  R\n2 = 0.62; n =256 (3) 25 \nRE61.05.2pH \u22c5+=  R\n2 = 0.61; n =256 (4) 26 \nWim de Vries \n 14 \n 1 \nThe mean Ellenberg ER and EN values per relev\u00e9 are terms in the GBMOVE regression equations. 2 \nAt each time step the simulated values of soil C\/N, soil pH, % soil moisture and cover-weighted 3 \ncanopy height are translated into Ellenberg units and put in the regression equation, resulting in 4 \npredicted probability of species occurrence over time. Changes in soil pH and C\/N ratio are 5 \npredicted with the dynamic soil model MAGIC. Canopy height can be changed arbitrarily using 6 \npre-existing knowledge of the pace of succession in a particular location, or on a more process-7 \nlinked basis, by the SUMO succession model. Climate variables can be changed to mimic 8 \nexpectations under different climate change scenarios. Likewise, soil moisture can also be changed 9 \nto mimic drainage or drought. 10 \n 11 \n2.2 The integrated dynamic FORSAFE-VEG model  12 \nThe only fully integrated dynamic soil and plant species diversity (vegetation) model that is 13 \npresently available in Europe is the ForSAFE-VEG model chain. This model chain,  developed in 14 \nSweden, consists of: (i) the ForSAFE model, aimed at the dynamic simulation of changes in soil 15 \nchemistry, soil organic matter, hydrology and tree biomass growth in relation to changes in 16 \nenvironmental factors (Wallman et al., 2005); and (ii) the VEG submodel, which simulates changes 17 \nin the composition of the ground vegetation in response to changes in biotic and abiotic factors 18 \nsuch as light intensity at the forest floor, temperature, grazing pressure, soil moisture, soil pH and 19 \nalkalinity in addition to competition between species based on height and root depth (Belyazid et 20 \nal., 2006; Sverdrup et al., 2007). For each time step, defined by the resolution of the input data, 21 \nForSAFE simulates the changes in state variables in response to environmental changes 22 \n(temperature and precipitation, atmospheric deposition, forest management). These state variables 23 \nare read by the VEG module, where the occupancy strength is calculated for each plant group. 24 \nThe plant groups are defined by the user. The single occupancy strengths are then used to 25 \ncalculate the relative occupancy of each plant group. 26 \nWim de Vries \n 15 \n 1 \nIf a stress factor would eliminate a certain species, the disappearance of this species will not be 2 \ninstantaneous, but will happen with a delay, which depends on the lifespan of the species. Unlike 3 \nthe model chains with MOVE and GBMOVR, this aspect is included in ForSAFE-VEG. The 4 \nchange in occupancy of a specific plant group, dX\/dt, depends on the actual occupancy of the 5 \nplant group (X), the target occupancy (referred to as equilibrium occupancy Xeq), and the specific 6 \nregeneration time of the plant group (\u03c4) according to the following equation: 7 \n 8 \n)XX(\n1\ndt\ndX\neq \u2212\u22c5\n\u03c4\n=  (5) 9 \n 10 \nThe regeneration time \u03c4 is related to the lifespan of a specific plant group. The life span depends 11 \non site factors, such as drought. The equilibrium occupancy of a plant group i, Xeq,i, is the ratio 12 \nbetween the strength of the species under the specific environmental conditions and the sum of 13 \nthe strengths of all present species according to the following equation: 14 \n 15 \n\u2211\n=\n=\n= plantgroupj\n1j j\ni\ni,eq\nS\nS\nX  (6) 16 \n 17 \nwhere Si is the individual strength of the plant group i. The sum of plant group strengths is also 18 \nused as an indicator of the density of the ground cover, referred to as the mass index (MI). The 19 \nstrength of each plant group is the product of the following drivers: (i) soil solution N 20 \nconcentration (mol.l-1), (ii) soil solution phosphorus concentration (mol.l-1), (iii) soil acidity ([H+], 21 \n[BC2+], [Al3+] (eq.l-1), (iv) soil water content (m3 water.m-3 soil), (v) soil temperature (\u00b0C), (vi) light 22 \nreaching the ground (\u00b5mol photon.m-2.s-1), (vii) grazing (moose units km-2), (viii) wind tatter and 23 \nwind chill damage, (ix) plant competition based on above-ground competition for light and below-24 \nWim de Vries \n 16 \nground competition for water and nutrients and (x) air CO2 concentration. ForSAFE-VEG thus 1 \nsimulates the ground vegetation occupancy based on the individual response of plant groups to 2 \nthese controlling factors. The effects are multiplicative and have the same weights in affecting the 3 \nplant strength. . Each plant group represents various individual plant species, varying from less 4 \nthan ten up to several hundreds.  5 \n 6 \nFor each plant group indicator that has been selected, response functions were parameterised for 7 \nSweden from published laboratory and field data, by approximations from empirical data, or by 8 \nscaling the response with respect to other plant groups for which the response is known. Scaling 9 \nof plant groups towards known responses was based on generic knowledge and expert opinions 10 \nfrom Swedish plant ecologists. However, the basic shape of each response function does not vary 11 \nbetween the plant groups. For example, all plant groups will respond positively to an increase in 12 \nwater availability in the soil up until a certain level where anaerobic conditions in the saturating soil 13 \nmay hinder the plant\u2019s growth. The distinction between the plant groups is the minimal water 14 \ncontent required for survival, optimal water content for growth, and the point at which water 15 \nbecomes damaging. The individual response functions are described in detail in Belyazid (2006) 16 \nand De Vries et al. (2007). 17 \n 18 \n3 Model validation on changes in soil and vegetation data 19 \n 20 \nResults of both types of model chains were compared with measurements on changes in soil and 21 \nvegetation data. The performance of the models was calculated by two measures that are often 22 \napplied for this purpose; the Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE; eq. 7), and the 23 \nNormalized Mean Error (NME; eq. 8) (Janssen and Heuberger, 1995).  24 \n 25 \nWim de Vries \n 17 \n( )\nO\nOP\nN\n1\nNRMSE\nN\n1i\n2\nii\u2211\n=\n\u2212\n=\n  (7) 1 \n 2 \nN\nOPNME \u2212=\n (8) 3 \n 4 \nWhere: 5 \nPi   = predicted value: model output for N2O emissions 6 \nOi   = observed value: field value for N2O emissions 7 \nP   = average for the predicted values 8 \nO   = average for the observed values 9 \nN  = number of observations 10 \n 11 \nNRMSE describes the deviations between the measurements and the predictions in a quadratic 12 \nway and is thus rather sensitive to extreme values. Optimally, it should be 0.  The NME compares 13 \npredictions and observations over the entire time-span, on an average basis. It expresses the bias in 14 \naverage values of model predictions and observations, and gives a rough indication of 15 \noverestimation (NME>0) or underestimation (NME<0). 16 \n 17 \n3.1  Linked dynamic soil models with static vegetation models 18 \nBelow, examples are given of the validation of the SMART2\/MAGIC-GBMOVE\/NTM model 19 \nchains with respect to soil chemical data (focus on MAGIC), aboveground biomass data (SUMO) 20 \nand time series of observed species composition and species richness (focus on GBMOVE in 21 \ncombination with MAGIC). 22 \n 23 \nWim de Vries \n 18 \nValidation of MAGIC on time series for soil chemical data: Data from plot-scale N-manipulation studies 1 \nin the UK have been used to test the ability of MAGIC to predict changes in soil C\/N under 2 \ndifferent addition levels (Evans et al., 2006). For two sites with high-quality soil C and N data 3 \n(Figure 2), the model successfully reproduced observed decreases in C\/N under three treatments. 4 \nThese simulations incorporated an (observed) increase in C storage as a consequence of N 5 \ndeposition, which slowed down the rate of C\/N change. The NME\u2019s derived were 0.0388 for the 6 \nRuabon site and 0.0813 for the Budworth site, indicating a slight overestimation of the predictions. 7 \nThe calculated NRMSE\u2019s were very low, i.e. 0.0065 and 0.014, respectively. 8 \n 9 \nMAGIC was also validated on data on C\/N ratios for the Parkgrass experimental site at 10 \nRothamsted, which are available for a 100-year period. N removal was calculated by multiplying 11 \nhay removal, for which accurate measurements are available, by the proportion of N in hay 12 \nbiomass. The uncertainty in N concentration in hay has a large effect on the net addition 13 \n(deposition minus removal) and thus on the historic C\/N trajectory (Table 1). Note that raising N 14 \ndeposition would have the same effect as reducing N removal. 15 \n 16 \nValidation of SUMO on time series of above-ground biomass: Biomass growth predicted by SUMO was 17 \nvalidated using data collected at two unfertilized grassland sites, one in the Netherlands and one in 18 \nthe UK, using site specific historical deposition data. The first grassland site is situated near 19 \nWageningen in the Netherlands and is part of a long-term field experiment started in 1958 on 20 \nformer agricultural land (Elberse et al., 1983). The second grassland site is the Parkgrass 21 \nexperimental site at Rothamstead in the UK mentioned before. The Parkgrass site was mown 22 \ntwice a year and the harvested biomass was weighed and averaged over ten year periods. The 23 \nexperiment started in 1856 and still continues today. The trends in herbage yields are extensively 24 \ndescribed by Jenkinson et al. (1994). At the Dutch site, the measured biomass varies greatly 25 \nbetween years due to yearly differences in rainfall and temperature. The simulated biomass does 26 \nWim de Vries \n 19 \nnot vary much and remains within the range of the measured biomass (Figure 3). The high 1 \nmeasured biomass in the first year is probably caused by the former agricultural use of the field. 2 \nBoth the measured and the simulated biomass show a decrease over the years, due to the yearly 3 \nbiomass removal. The results for Rothamstead show that the harvested biomass is fairly well 4 \nsimulated by SUMO. The reduction in biomass harvest between 1850 and 1900, due to exhaustion 5 \nof the soil, the stabilisation of the harvest when the effect of N deposition compensated for the 6 \nexhaustion between 1900 and 1950, and the increase of the harvest later on due to the further 7 \nincrease in deposition since 1950 are simulated quite well. The effect of N deposition since 8 \napproximately 1960 is underestimated, however (Figure 3 right). Overall, the NME of the 9 \nOssekampen was -0.012 and -0.0033 for Rothamsted, implying that on average, the predictions are 10 \nalmost equal to the observations. The values for the NMRSE are 0.290 and 0.195, respectively 11 \nindicating a considerable deviation for defined years. SUMO was also validated on a heathland and 12 \na forest site in the Netherlands, as described in De Vries et al. (2007). 13 \n 14 \nValidation of MAGIC-GBMOVE on time series of observed species composition and species richness: A 15 \nnumber of tests have been carried out to determine how successfully MAGIC-GBMOVE could 16 \nreproduce the observed species composition in sampled plots. Observations were compared with 17 \npredictions generated initially by populating a simulated set of plots with species conditioned on 18 \nprobability of occurrence values generated by GBMOVE and a Poisson distribution of mean 19 \nspecies-richness values with proportional variance predicted by a separate General Linear Mixed 20 \nModel using the same explanatory variables as GBMOVE. This statistical model is fully described 21 \nin Smart et al. (2005). To assess the influence of uncertainty in the calibration equations relating 22 \nsoil properties to mean Ellenberg scores, predictions of species composition based on soil C\/N 23 \nand pH generated by MAGIC were compared with predictions based on observed mean Ellenberg 24 \nscores. These comparisons were carried out for control plots at the long-term continuous Park 25 \nGrass hay experiment at Rothamsted (unimproved neutral grassland) and the Hard Hills grazing 26 \nWim de Vries \n 20 \nand burning experiment at Moorhouse National Nature Reserve (ombrogenous bog), described in 1 \nSmart et al. (2005). The results for Rothamsted indicated that when mean Ellenberg scores based 2 \non observed species composition were used as input to GBMOVE, on average 67% of species 3 \nobserved were actually predicted. However, when predictions were based on MAGIC simulations 4 \nof soil C\/N and pH as input to GBMOVE, the percentage of all species correctly predicted 5 \ndecreased substantially (Figure 4 left). The main reason for the poor performance at Rothamsted 6 \nappears to be that observed soil changes were inconsistent with observed vegetation changes. This 7 \nis most likely due to sampling practices in the experimental plots, avoiding a thin mat of persistent 8 \nlitter that had developed in the O horizon over the course of the experiment. This resulted in C\/N 9 \nmeasurements indicating a higher fertility in the rooting zone than that encountered by at least 10 \nsome of the more shallow rooting species present. Also at Moorhouse, both the predictions from 11 \nMAGIC linked to GBMOVE and the predictions based solely on observed mean Ellenberg values 12 \ndid not compare well with the species actually observed in the control plots, although the key 13 \ndominants in the vegetation were predicted to be present by both models.  (Figure 4 right). When 14 \npredicted species lists for both GBMOVE and MAGIC+GBMOVE were examined, key absences 15 \nincluded a range of bryophytes. Possibly, bryophytes are more responsive to direct deposition 16 \neffects, and less so to changes in soil chemistry, making the approach less useful for lower plants. 17 \n 18 \nFrom this model comparison it was concluded that it is unlikely that both generally applicable yet 19 \nhighly accurate models can be developed, because of the dependence of current species 20 \ncomposition on site-specific aspects of patch and wider landscape history. Because of this, 21 \nprobabilities of occurrence from GBMOVE are no longer used as expectations of species 22 \npresence, but rather interpreted as indices of habitat suitability where target species ought to be 23 \nable to persist and increase in population size in the absence of constraints to dispersal and 24 \nestablishment. The further validation work therefore focuses on comparing predicted trends 25 \nWim de Vries \n 21 \nthrough time with observed changes, based on species present on-site and in the local species 1 \npool, rather than attempting to predict the entire species assemblage on a specific site. 2 \n 3 \nValidation of MAGIC-GBMOVE on temporal changes among plant species: At Moorhouse, observed 4 \nversus predicted species changes over time were summarised as slope coefficients for each species 5 \nin a linear regression line relating (i) observed abundance over the years and (ii) predicted habitat 6 \nsuitability from MAGIC and GBMOVE across the same time period. Despite considerable scatter 7 \nthere was a positive correlation between observed change in species frequency and predicted 8 \nchange in habitat suitability (Figure 5). A chi-square test of observed versus predicted directions of 9 \nchange was significant (p=0.016). While the correlation between observed and predicted slopes 10 \nwas also significant, predicted rates of change covered a narrower range than observed species 11 \nchanges, which may be due to weather fluctuations or sampling errors.  12 \n 13 \n3.2 The integrated dynamic FORSAFE-VEG model  14 \nThe ForSAFE-VEG model was validated on changes in soil chemistry (Belyazid et al., 2006), 15 \nstanding wood biomass (Belyazid, 2006) and in ground vegetation cover (Sverdrup et al., 2007) at 16 \n16 Swedish forest sites that are part of the ICP Forest level II monitoring network (International 17 \nCo-operative Program on Assessment and Monitoring of Air Pollution Effects on Forests, 18 \nhttp:\/\/www.icp-forests.org). At the sites, 42 plant groups and 9 tree seedling types have been 19 \nidentified. These plant groups were assumed to be potentially present throughout Sweden, but are 20 \nonly expected to manifest where environmental conditions are favourable. The sites cover a wide 21 \nrange of climatic conditions, soils, fire regimes, atmospheric deposition gradients and management 22 \nhistories. ForSAFE-VEG was used to simulate the changes in soil chemistry, hydrology and tree 23 \nbiomass according to these conditions, and the composition of the ground vegetation was 24 \nsubsequently derived. Atmospheric deposition data for NO3\n++NH4\n+ and SO4\n- were derived on the 25 \nbasis of EMEP model estimates according to the 1999 LRTAP Gothenburg protocol (Sch\u00f6pp et 26 \nWim de Vries \n 22 \nal., 2003). The sites were subject to different histories of fire regimes, alterations between open 1 \nfields and forest cover as well as different harvesting regimes depending on the location of each 2 \nsite.  3 \n 4 \nValidation on soil chemical data. Simulated soil organic matter contents showed a reasonable 5 \ncorrelation between the measured and modelled values of soil organic carbon (C) and N at the 16 6 \nstudy sites. The NME\u2019s derived were -79 g\/m2 for organic C and -3.04 g\/m2 for organic N, 7 \nindicating a slight underestimation of the predictions. The calculated NRMSE\u2019s were quite high, 8 \ni.e. 0.58 for both organic C and N. 9 \n 10 \nThe model reconstructs the pH profiles at the 16 study sites quite well (Figure 6). The NME for 11 \nthe 16 sites varied from -0.056 to + 0.097 while the NMRSE varied from 0.016 to 0.210, indicating 12 \nan appropriate prediction of the average pH and a limited deviation with measurements at various 13 \ndepth. The model, however underestimates the acidity at the deeper soil layers (Figure 6). This 14 \ninconsistency is probably due to the fact that the model considers only a limited amount of roots 15 \nat the deep layers, thus underestimating uptake and the presence of organic matter and its 16 \ndecomposition. Also important for the ground-vegetation community is the soil base cation to 17 \naluminium ratio (BC\/Al ratio). The variation in both the measured and modelled BC\/Al ratios was 18 \nlarge for most of the sites, but the correspondence between the model and the measurements was 19 \nreasonably good. More information on the validation of soil organic C and N and of soil pH is 20 \ngiven in Belyazid (2006) and Belyazid et al. (2006), respectively. 21 \n 22 \nValidation of standing tree biomass and ground vegetation composition: Predicted values for the ground 23 \noccupancy of the 42 identified plant groups calculated with ForSAFE-VEG for the year 1995 were 24 \nplotted against measurements from the same year to establish the validity of the model outputs at 25 \nthe 16 sites (Sverdrup et al., 2007). Results are presented for two representative sites, i.e.  Brattfors 26 \nWim de Vries \n 23 \n(Figure 7 left) and Svartberget (Figure 7, right). The model predicts fairly well the occupancy of the 1 \npresent vegetation groups. The NMRSE varied from 0.167 for Brattfors to 0.197 for Svartberget, 2 \nwhile the NME is close to 0.  Recently, the model has also been validated on two Swiss forest 3 \nplots (Aeschau and Bachtel). A comparison of the model output for these test sites to ground 4 \nvegetation assessment showed that only 40-55% of the species present at these two sites were also 5 \nmodelled.. The presence of major species, i.e. Vaccinium myrtillus, Blechnum spicant, Dryopteris dilatata, 6 \nPolytrichum formosum,  Rubus fruticosus and Oxalis acetosella were, however, forecasted correctly in both 7 \nsites, for the latter two species even predicted with a correct estimate of the cover degree. The 8 \nobserved sensitive reaction of Rubus fructicosus cover to N deposition, was also predicted well 9 \nForSAFE-VEG. Finally, tree biomass was predicted well for the two Swiss test sites. 10 \n 11 \n4 Model application: assessment of critical nitrogen loads  12 \n 13 \n4.1 Application of the SMART2-MOVE model for Dutch vegetation types 14 \nTo date, the MAGIC-GBMOVE model has not been applied in \u2018inverse mode\u2019 to estimate critical 15 \nloads based on biodiversity targets. The SMART2-MOVE model, however, has been used in an 16 \ninverse way to assess critical loads and target loads for major vegetation types in the Netherlands 17 \nand to compare results with empirical critical N loads (Van Dobben et al., 2006). The empirical 18 \ncritical loads and the calculated critical loads correspond reasonably well (Table 2), i.e. their ranges 19 \nusually overlap, although there is no significant correlation between the range midpoints of the 20 \ntwo methods. The comparison of methods is slightly hampered by the fact that simulated values 21 \nare determined for a very detailed typology (associations or sub-associations in the sense of  22 \nBraun-Blanquet, 1964; Schamin\u00e9e et al., 1995) while the empirical values were determined for so-23 \ncalled 'EUNIS' classes, where EUNIS stands for European Nature Information System (Davies 24 \nand Moss, 2002). On average the midpoints of the empirical ranges are 3.4 kg N ha-1.y-1 below the 25 \nsimulated range midpoints, and this difference is nearly significant (P\u22480.07). There are various 26 \nWim de Vries \n 24 \nreasons for the lower empirical values compared to the simulated ones, the most important 1 \nprobably being that the empirical critical loads tend to be based on the most sensitive components 2 \nof an ecosystem, often under abiotic conditions that enhance sensitivity still further (cf. 3 \nAchermann and Bobbink, 2003). In contrast, in the simulation approach all environmental 4 \nconditions are usually set to 'mean' or 'most probable' values.  5 \n 6 \nIn the Netherlands recent attempts to integrate the empirical and the simulation method have 7 \nmade use of the virtues of both: the broad scientific acceptance (at least in Europe) of the 8 \nempirical values, and the ecological detail of the simulated ones (Van Dobben and van Hinsberg, 9 \n2008). To this end, both the EUNIS typology and Schamin\u00e9e et al.'s (1995) typology were 10 \ntranslated into the European Habitat typology (Commission of the European Communities, 2003), 11 \nand critical load ranges were determined according to both methods. For each Habitat type a 12 \nunique critical load value was determined as the midpoint of the simulated range when this 13 \nmidpoint was with the empirical range; otherwise either the upper or the lower extreme of the 14 \nempirical range was used. This method was developed in response to the policymaker's need for 15 \nunique critical load values per Habitat type, to be used for the assessment of human activities in 16 \nEuropean 'Natura 2000' areas. 17 \n  18 \n4.2 Application of the ForSAFE-VEG model at 16 Swedish forest sites  19 \nForSAFE-VEG does not run in an inverse mode to derive critical loads. Actually, this is 20 \nimpossible, as the model is too complex to be used in an inverse way. Instead the \u201ccritical load\u201d is 21 \ndetermined to be passed at the time one can observe unwanted significant shifts in vegetation 22 \ncomposition or abundance. This time is used for estimating the critical load, which is defined in 23 \nthis case as the deposition of N at the point in time of significant unwanted vegetation change. 24 \nActually, this value is dependent on the site history. To estimate the critical loads of N, a 25 \npreliminary definition was adopted by which a 95% of the natural ground vegetation composition 26 \nWim de Vries \n 25 \nis preserved. This definition excludes the effect of other factors than N on the ground vegetation 1 \ncomposition.  2 \n 3 \nCritical-load estimates for 16 forested sites in Sweden thus derived are given in Table 3. The table 4 \npresents the year when the acceptable change in ground vegetation composition occurred, and the 5 \nvalue of the deposition at that year. A reduction from today\u2019s deposition values can then be 6 \ndeduced to lower the deposition to the historic value that preceded the undesired change in the 7 \nground-vegetation composition (Table 3). The estimates set the critical load as the deposition at 8 \nthe time the change occurs, probably leading to a slight overestimate of the critical load. Results 9 \nshow that all sites have significant exceedance, and in order to protect 95% of the area, a 90% 10 \nreduction of present deposition is required, implying an average atmospheric deposition in 11 \nsouthern Sweden of 1.1 kg N.ha-1.yr-1. Using a protective level to 50%, still 55% reduction in 12 \npresent deposition will be required, implying an average deposition in southern Sweden of 2.8 kg 13 \nN.ha-1.yr-1. 14 \n 15 \n5 Comparison and evaluation of the model chains  16 \n 17 \nComparison of model approaches and evaluation of the model chains  18 \nThe modelling approaches described in this article consist of a combination of a biogeochemical 19 \nmodel of nutrient (including N) behaviour in the soil, connected with a vegetation model 20 \npredicting water, N and acidity impacts on biodiversity. The biogeochemical models discussed are 21 \nSMART2 (either or not in connection with SUMO), MAGIC and ForSAFE. These models differ 22 \nwith respect to the included processes and management options (Table 4). Models of vegetation 23 \nsuccession are included in ForSAFE, and in the model chain SMART2-SUMO-MOVE\/NTM, 24 \nwith SUMO being a specific model for vegetation succession. Vegetation-succession models are 25 \nintermediates between biogeochemical models and species-composition models since they 26 \nWim de Vries \n 26 \nsimulate changes in elemental budgets and biomass distribution. Both SUMO and FORSAFE thus 1 \nsimulate the development of vegetation biomass and stocks of nutrient elements in relation to 2 \nevents such as fire, grazing, mowing or turf stripping. For example, grazing increases light 3 \navailability and thus favours the growth of short-growing plants. 4 \n 5 \nA comparison of the characteristics of the vegetation models and succession models predicting N 6 \nimpacts on biodiversity (MOVE\/NTM, VEG and SUMO) is given in Table 5. The major strength 7 \nof the SMART2\/ MAGIC-GBMOVE\/NTM approach is the empirical determination of the 8 \nrelation between plant species composition and soil moisture, nutrient availability and soil acidity. 9 \nFurthermore, the relationships are based on species-response curves of a large number of higher 10 \nand lower plant species (e.g. in MOVE about 900 plant species are covered (Wiertz et al., 1992) . 11 \nBy using vegetation relev\u00e9s identified on the level of vegetation types, it was possible to estimate 12 \ncritical limits for these vegetation types based on percentile values of the Ellenberg indicators for 13 \nnutrients and pH. Thus the strength of the resulting empirical niche models is that the weight of 14 \ndata reduces noise relative to species-environment relationships, at least in the Ellenberg domain. 15 \nGBMOVE also includes climate and management besides N and acidity, again based on survey 16 \ndata, and thus incorporates the impacts of climate and management on plant species diversity and 17 \nits modifying effect on critical loads. 18 \n 19 \nThe major weakness of the SMART2\/MAGIC-GBMOVE\/NTM approach is that a relationship 20 \nis needed between Ellenberg indicators for N and moisture availability and acidity and measured 21 \nvalues for these abiotic variables. Such calibration equations increase uncertainty because soil pH, 22 \nsoil C\/N and soil moisture do not explain the total variation in mean Ellenberg scores. The greater 23 \nthe scatter about each regression line the more likely it is that predictions of mean Ellenberg values 24 \nfrom soil measurements will differ from actual observations. The relationship with N indicators, 25 \nsuch as N availability used in MOVE and soil C\/N ratio used in GBMOVE, is rather weak, 26 \nWim de Vries \n 27 \nespecially in high-fertility ecosystems. Especially the uncertainty in the Ellenberg indicator for 1 \nnutrient availability is large and can be the main source of uncertainty in the end result 2 \n(Schouwenberg et al., 2000; Wamelink et al., 2002). Ideally the use of Ellenberg indicator values 3 \nshould thus be avoided and response curves should be estimated from actual measurements of soil 4 \npH and N availability (Wamelink et al., 2005). Furthermore, it is not likely that the relations 5 \nbetween Ellenberg indicator values and actual conditions derived for the Netherlands or the 6 \nUnited Kingdom are valid for other countries. Therefore, to use these models in other countries it 7 \nis necessary to analyse local vegetation relev\u00e9s in order to assign critical site factors to ecosystems. 8 \nFinally, the output of the model chains is the potential vegetation on a site, whereas the observed 9 \nvegetation may differ due to time lag effects. The MOVE and GBMOVE models are based on 10 \nempirical observations recorded at different times in the past 30-70 years across Dutch and British 11 \necosystems while the resulting regression models assume equilibrium between species and 12 \nenvironment and the niche of each species is thus static. Another weakness is the lack of feedback 13 \nbetween vegetation change and the soil model, at least when SUMO is not included. 14 \n 15 \nThe major strength of ForSAFE-VEG is the mechanistic approach relating (many) abiotic 16 \nparameters to plant species diversity including: (i) ground vegetation community competition, 17 \nfeedbacks from climate and from grazing animals and forest management and (ii) the mechanistic 18 \nintegration of the N cycle with process kinetics and feedbacks to the chemistry, organic matter 19 \ndecomposition and growth cycles. Furthermore, the model is field tested in Sweden. The major 20 \nweakness of the ForSAFE-VEG approach is the high data demand. This holds specifically for the 21 \ndriving variables that consist mainly of descriptions of events, in particular the timing and intensity 22 \nof grazing and other management events, which is also a limitation of SUMO. Furthermore, the 23 \ncomplexity of the model makes interpretation of the results difficult, especially how different 24 \nfactors like acidity, nitrogen, management and climate change are all linked to biodiversity.  25 \n 26 \nWim de Vries \n 28 \nUse of nitrogen indicators in view of impacts on plant species occurrence 1 \nTo connect theory on N dynamics in soils with models of plant species occurrence, a measure of 2 \nN exposure, i.e. of plant-available N, is required. There are different measures to integrate N 3 \nexposure into a single indicator. Some of these indicators give direct information on an N flux to 4 \nthe ecosystem, whereas other indicators only give indirect information based on correlations with 5 \nfluxes. Most effects of N are due to an excess of N, either in the form of NH4 or NOx. In the soil 6 \nmodels, a differentiation is made between NH4 and NO3 but not in the vegetation response 7 \nmodels, even though there are indications that plants are more sensitive for NH4 than for NO3  8 \n(see e.g. Bobbink et al., 2003). The knowledge is, however, considered too limited to include in the 9 \nvegetation effect models. 10 \n 11 \nMajor direct indicators of N availability are: (i) gross mineralization and nitrification rates, 12 \nreflecting the internal N cycling and thus potentially the maximum inorganic-N pool available to 13 \nplants in competition with microbial uptake and (ii) N deposition. The N-deposition flux 14 \naccurately reflects the exposure of species with limited root systems, particularly bryophytes and 15 \nlichens. In other systems, however, the transformation of N by soil microorganisms modifies plant 16 \nexposure and N-deposition flux is thus not a good measure of exposure for plants rooting in soil. 17 \nA better indicator is the sum of N deposition and N mineralization, as used in the SMART2-18 \nSUMO-MOVE approach, although the link to biodiversity is only expert-based, namely through 19 \nthe Ellenberg N indicator. 20 \n 21 \nIndirect indicators, which are correlated with N availability, include (Rowe et al., 2005): (i) soil 22 \nsolution N concentration, (ii) plant tissue N concentration, (iii) soil C\/N ratio and (iv) indicators 23 \nbased on the plant species assemblage. Apart from various other factors, use of a soil solution N 24 \nconcentration forms the basis of the ForSAFE-VEG model approach. The advantage of using this 25 \nindicator is that the soluble N pool is immediately available to plants. However, soil solution only 26 \nWim de Vries \n 29 \nreflects the N in excess of uptake and leaching losses and thus may underestimate total N 1 \navailability to plants. Concentrations are also very dynamic, both spatially and temporally, and 2 \nsingle measurements of soil-solution N concentrations are thus of limited use. Measures integrated 3 \nover time are thus more reliable indicators of N status. Furthermore, species differ in their ability 4 \nto use different forms of soluble N, i.e. NO3, NH4 and DON and the ratio of ammonium to 5 \nnitrate in solution may provide information relevant to species occurrence and also the potential 6 \nfor microbial uptake of nitrate. Measures of plant chemistry are not yet used in any of the models. 7 \nA disadvantage of the use of tissue concentrations is that they vary considerably in time 8 \n(seasonally), among species, plant parts, tissue age\/phenological stage and with nutrient supply, 9 \ngrazing or other management (Rowe et al., 2005). Nevertheless, if these factors can be controlled 10 \n(e.g. by sampling a standard part, from a single species or group, at a standard time of year), tissue 11 \nconcentrations of N and amino acids may be good indicators of N exposure and in principle could 12 \nbe outputs from biogeochemical models. The soil C\/N ratio, as used in the GBMOVE approach, 13 \nis not directly influencing plant response but represents a readily measurable proxy for important 14 \nprocesses (e.g. mineralization or nitrification). In general, the relationship is weak, since total soil 15 \nN is largely inactive, and it is not a good indicator of N availability (Tamm, 1991). Finally, 16 \nEllenberg indicators (Ellenberg et al., 1992) are used in GBMOVE, MOVE and NTM to describe 17 \nassemblages of European vascular plants and bryophytes. Mean Ellenberg fertility scores have 18 \nbeen shown to be reasonable indicators of soil N availability (Van Dobben, 1993), although the 19 \nrelationship usually shows large variation (Wamelink et al., 2002) and appears to correlate best with 20 \nannual above-ground biomass production rather than soil nutrient status (Hill and Carey, 1997). 21 \nHowever, in systems which are limited by other nutrients, e.g. phosphorous or potassium, this may 22 \nnot be the case.  23 \n 24 \nIn summary, plants do not respond to a single abiotic variable, and there are problems with all 25 \nvariables that could potentially be used as input to the vegetation models. Those considered most 26 \nWim de Vries \n 30 \nuseful are direct indicators of N availability, such as N deposition plus N mineralization, followed 1 \nby indirect indicators, such as soil solution N concentrations in the rooting zone, foliar N 2 \nconcentration or soil C\/N ratio. 3 \n 4 \nModel validation status  5 \nThe validation status of the various models differs, specifically with respect to the comparisons 6 \nbetween measured and modelled changes in plant species composition. In general, the 7 \nbiogeochemical models used (SMART2, MAGIC and ForSAFE) have a good validation status. 8 \nFor example, SMART2 has been validated on the German \u2018Solling site\u2019 and hundreds of 9 \nintensively monitored forest plots (De Vries et al., 2003). Here we show that MAGIC is able to 10 \npredict changes in observed N leaching and soil C\/N in plot-scale N manipulation studies under 11 \ndifferent addition levels. The ForSAFE model also shows a good correlation between simulated 12 \nand measured values of tree biomass, pools of soil organic C and N, soil pH and BC\/Al ratios at 13 \n16 Swedish forest sites.  14 \n 15 \nThe validation status of the vegetation models is, however, much less advanced. Biomass growth 16 \nof SUMO has until now only been validated on data collected at a grassland site, a heathland site 17 \nand a forest site in the Netherlands and a grassland site in the UK. Regarding (GB)MOVE, a 18 \npreliminary test was made whether GBMOVE in combination with MAGIC could reproduce the 19 \nobserved species composition in test plots, including an unimproved neutral grassland and a 20 \nblanket bog. The comparisons of predicted species occurrence using measured soil C\/N and pH 21 \nversus mean Ellenberg scores indicate that the greatest uncertainty in model predictions, is due to 22 \nthe weak calibration relationships, especially those between soil C\/N and mean Ellenberg N at 23 \nhigh fertility. Current model development is therefore focusing on the establishment of a direct 24 \nrelation between N indicators and species composition. Finally, the ForSAFE-VEG model has 25 \nuntil now been validated at 16 Swedish forest sites, by comparing simulated and measured values 26 \nWim de Vries \n 31 \non the ground occupancy of 42 plant groups, and in Switzerland. Considering the sometimes poor 1 \ncorrelations in all model applications, as described above, there is still a need for substantial model 2 \nvalidation and model improvement. In this context, good model-testing data are urgently needed.  3 \n 4 \nReliability of biogeochemistry-biodiversity modelling approaches to assess critical  loads  5 \nUp to now, only the SMART-MOVE model chain has been used to assess critical loads by using 6 \nthe model in an inverse way. Due to its complexity, t he ForSAFE-VEG  model is more suited to 7 \npredict response of plant species composition to environmental change than to predict critical 8 \nloads. A major disadvantage is the fact that the critical N load is influenced by the N deposition 9 \nhistory. The uncertainties in the assessed critical loads, using SMART-MOVE model chain, are 10 \nspecifically due to uncertainties  in the calibration equations between abiotic conditions and 11 \nEllenberg scores, used to transfer information between soil models and plant-species models. A 12 \ndetailed uncertainty analysis, focusing on this aspect, was carried out by  van Dobben et al. (2006). 13 \nResults show that the uncertainty in critical loads per vegetation type is quite high (generally in a 14 \nrange of 15-40% of the average value), but the ranges of simulated and empirical values usually 15 \noverlap, implying that the results are applicable for practical purposes. However, at the site level, 16 \nuncertainty becomes very large and thus it is not yet possible to determine critical loads with any 17 \npractical significance (Van Dobben et al., 2006). The uncertainties can only be reduced if more 18 \ndata become available on the abiotic response per species under field conditions, at least to N 19 \navailability and soil pH, as described below. 20 \n 21 \nDespite the uncertainties in the described model approaches, the approach provides a relevant 22 \naddition to empirical critical-load estimates.  First of all, even though empirical critical loads may 23 \nbe as good or even better than modelled critical loads at present, dynamic models allow us to 24 \nexplore impacts of future scenarios, where habitats may face completely novel configurations of 25 \nmultiple drivers, so-called \u201cno analogue\u201d states (Steffen et al., 2004). In these situations empirical 26 \nWim de Vries \n 32 \ncritical loads that are based on reviews of contemporary and historical data become may be 1 \nincreasingly inappropriate and process based, detailed models are necessary. Critical loads can be 2 \ninterpreted as a means of identifying thresholds of ecosystem resilience (Gunderson, 2000). 3 \nEstimating resilience thresholds using linked soil-vegetation models is therefore particularly 4 \nappropriate, because of several key aspects associated with ecosystem responses to perturbation. 5 \nThreshold changes and non-linear responses to disturbance, species invasion and changes in 6 \nnutrient availability can result from the dynamic interplay between above- and below-ground biota 7 \nand differences in the extent to which soil and vegetation store or more rapidly process and release 8 \nexcess nutrients or buffer pH changes (Evans et al., 2001; Craine et al., 2002). Hence resilience is a 9 \nproperty related to the ability of soil and vegetation to buffer or to amplify the response to 10 \nchanging conditions. Quantifying resilience and proximity to thresholds of change then requires 11 \nquantification of the dynamic relationships between ecosystem compartments (e.g. Suding et al., 12 \n2008). Policy interest also focuses on timescales for recovery; hence dynamic modelling is required 13 \nto model the persistence of alternative stable states that can result when perturbations drive 14 \necosystems into new domains of stability (Gunderson, 2000; Suding et al., 2004). While it may be 15 \npossible to identify critical ecosystem state variables that are closely correlated with damage and 16 \nloss of adaptive capacity, these may be above or below ground (e.g. Strengbom et al., 2001) once 17 \nmore emphasising the importance of jointly modelling soil and vegetation. Lastly, the critical-load 18 \napproach increasingly recognises that resilience is not realistically thought of as a threshold situated 19 \nalong single or multiple, yet independent, abiotic axes. Multiple drivers and their interactions are 20 \nimportant. For example, land use around a nature reserve can change the composition of the local 21 \nspecies pool, increasing availability of species that could capitalise on changes in soil conditions 22 \ndriven by atmospheric pollutant deposition or conversely, reducing the availability of desirable 23 \nspecies for recolonisation following recovery and remediation (Lindborg and Eriksson, 2004). 24 \nDynamic model development offers a way of incorporating other drivers as modifiers of the 25 \nWim de Vries \n 33 \ncritical-load range and allowing multiple drivers to dynamically interact. The fully integrated, 1 \nmechanistic ForSafe-VEG model is most appropriate to investigate such interactions.  2 \n 3 \nMeasurements of plant species response to environmental variables 4 \nExpert-based estimates of plant species responses to environmental variables form the basis of all 5 \nmodels. Although the Ellenberg indicator system (Ellenberg et al., 1992) or its derivates 6 \n(Diekmann, 2003) are the most frequently used systems for this, their uncertainty is quite large, it 7 \nis sometimes unclear what the indicator values represent, and they may be biased (Ertsen et al., 8 \n1998; Schaffers and Sykora, 2000; Wamelink et al., 2002; Wamelink et al., 2003b; Witte and von 9 \nAsmuth, 2003; Smart and Scott, 2004; Wamelink et al., 2004). Furthermore, it requires a translation 10 \nfrom indicator values into soil chemical variables.  11 \n 12 \nThe most logical solution to avoid this highly uncertain step is to replace the Ellenberg indicator 13 \nsystem by a system based on measurements (Wamelink et al., 2002). On a small scale this was 14 \ncarried out for France (G\u00e9gout et al., 2003) and the Netherlands (Wamelink et al., 2005). Results 15 \nare promising, but Europe-wide and international data are needed, instead of only national data to 16 \nensure a wide application. Such data should consist of a vegetation description (relev\u00e9s) and at 17 \nleast the following measured variables: geographical coordinates, soil acidity, nutrient status, and 18 \nwater availability. Based on this, plant species response per abiotic variable can be estimated, 19 \nreviewed and tested on independent datasets. The hypothesis that plant species have different 20 \nresponses in different regions can be tested on the basis of such data. 21 \n 22 \nRelevant extensions to the modelling approaches. 23 \nAs mentioned above, in the SMART2\/ MAGIC- (GB)MOVE\/ NTM model chain, model output 24 \nis the potential vegetation on a site, not accounting for time-lag effects. Priorities for future work 25 \non modelling N impacts on biodiversity in this model chain thus include: (i) inclusion of species-26 \nWim de Vries \n 34 \nresponse curves based on combined field measurements of vegetation relev\u00e9s and abiotic data and 1 \n(ii) representation of lag times (e.g. due to species persistence, dispersal).  2 \n 3 \nThe present linked-model approaches further centre upon the impact of N deposition on existing 4 \nspecies assemblages. However, changes in resource availability are also predicted to increase 5 \nsusceptibility to invasion by immigrants, some of which could possess traits associated with 6 \nsuppression of resident species and changes in nutrient cycling (Evans et al., 2001; Davis et al., 7 \n2005). If information about the composition of the regional species pool is available, then model 8 \napplication could be extended to estimate changes in habitat suitability for potential immigrants. 9 \nThis would amount to a risk assessment of the establishment of potential invaders. Incorporating 10 \nthe dynamic impact of invasive species on above and below-ground ecosystem compartments is 11 \npossible in the presented model approaches but would require modification of the biomass growth 12 \nmodels in SUMO and For-SAFE\/VEG. 13 \n 14 \nConclusions on the potential of linked biogeochemistry-biodiversity modelling approaches 15 \nThe following conclusions can be drawn regarding the modelling approaches presented here: 16 \n- Vegetation models, based on either large-scale vegetation surveys (MOVE\/ GBMOVE, 17 \nNTM) or mainly experimental data (VEG), have been developed and integrated with 18 \nbiogeochemical models, such as SMART2 (either or not in connection with SUMO), MAGIC 19 \nand ForSAFE.  20 \n- There are large similarities between the models, particularly those based on survey data, but 21 \nthere are also several important differences, including: (i) use of different abiotic variables for 22 \nN, such as N availability and Ellenberg N indicators in SMART2-MOVE\/NTM, soil C\/N 23 \nratio in GBMOVE and soil-solution N in ForSAFE, (ii) prediction of individual plant species 24 \n(e.g. MOVE\/GBMOVE) versus plant communities (NTM) and (iii) calibration based on 25 \ndifferent (national) soil and vegetation datasets. 26 \nWim de Vries \n 35 \n- At their current level of development, most integrated models focus primarily on predicting 1 \nthe biodiversity impacts of different scenarios in terms of air-quality change and climate 2 \nchange.  3 \n- The model chains can also predict biodiversity-based critical loads or target loads. In doing 4 \nthis, the definition of reference conditions and damage thresholds for terrestrial biodiversity 5 \nrepresents a major challenge. Although the definition of biodiversity targets is an issue for 6 \npolicy-makers, dynamic models can provide valuable information on realistic reference 7 \nconditions and achievable recovery targets.  8 \n- The reliance on Ellenberg indicator values, used as a proxy for abiotic conditions in survey-9 \nbased models such as SMART2-MOVE and MAGIC-GBMOVE, adds uncertainty to model 10 \npredictions. However, Ellenberg values are likely to remain necessary in many areas due to the 11 \ninsufficient European coverage of combined vegetation and soil survey data.  12 \n- Models based on survey data have largest potential for country-wide mapping of critical loads 13 \nin view of their limited data demands. This holds not only for Europe but also for other areas 14 \ncoping with elevated N deposition, such as North America and China. However, testing and 15 \nadaptation of the linkage between vegetation and soil, using e.g. Ellenberg indicators is needed 16 \nfor other countries or ecosystems before large-scale applications can be made. Furthermore, 17 \nresults are quite reliable for vegetation types but at site level, the uncertainty in critical loads 18 \nbecomes too large to be of practical significance. 19 \n- In combination, both empirical and model-based critical loads, are powerful tools to assess a 20 \nreliable value for defined ecosystems. An example of such a combination approach is 21 \npresented by Van Dobben and van Hinsberg (2008). 22 \n 23 \nDespite the various limitations mentioned, this overview shows that linked biogeochemistry-24 \nbiodiversity models for N have great potential for applications to support policies to reduce N 25 \ninputs. Apart from further model development, there is a need for further testing and validation of 26 \nWim de Vries \n 36 \nthe models against long-term monitoring or long-term experimental datasets and against large-1 \nscale survey data. In this context, the continuation of existing programmes, where possible with 2 \nimproved integration of biotic and abiotic measurements, is essential to the future development of 3 \nthis work. Finally, there is a need for adaptation and upscaling of the models beyond the regions 4 \nfor which dose-response relationships have been parameterised, such as Mediterranean and Alpine 5 \nregions, and Eastern Europe, based on a focused data collection combing vegetation descriptions 6 \nwith variables affecting the species diversity. A similar approach outside Europe would also allow 7 \nthe use of these models, both for predicting impacts of scenarios and assessing critical loads. 8 \n 9 \nAcknowledgments 10 \nThe preparation of this paper has been partially supported by the European Commission LIFE 11 \nprogramme within the framework of the European Consortium for Modelling Air Pollution and 12 \nClimate Strategies (EC4MACS) and the trust fund for the partial funding of effect-oriented 13 \nactivities under the Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution. We also thank the 14 \ntwo anonymous reviewers for their detailed and helpful comments which largely improved the 15 \npaper. 16 \n 17 \n 18 \nWim de Vries \n 37 \nReferences 1 \nAchermann, B., Bobbink, R.
