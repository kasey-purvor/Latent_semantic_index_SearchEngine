Stephenson (1)\nCranfield University, Cranfield, UK\nAbstract: By using hydrodynamic and thermal modelling, the variation of the convection heat transfer \ncoefficient (CHTC) of the process fluids within the grinding zone has been investigated. Experimental \nmeasurements of CHTC for different grinding fluids have been undertaken and show that the CHTC depends \non the grinding wheel speed and the fluid film thickness within the contact zone. The film thickness is \ndetermined by grinding wheel speed, porosity, grain size, fluid type, flow rate and nozzle size. The CHTC \nvalues are compared for a wide range of grinding regimes, including HEDG, creep feed and finish grinding. \nKeywords: Modelling, Grinding, Fluid\n1 INTRODUCTION\nCooling by the process fluids plays a crucial role in grinding \nto avoid thermal damage to the workpiece surface. This is \nespecially important for deep grinding, such as creep feed \ngrinding and high efficiency deep grinding (HEDG) where \nhigh thermal energy is produced due to the high material \nremoval rates used. The cooling efficiency can be quantified \nby the convection heat transfer coefficient (CHTC) of the \nfluid, which is an important variable determining the amount \nand ratio of the heat convected away and hence the \nsubsequent workpiece surface temperature. To predict the \ngrinding temperatures, it is preferable that an accurate value \nof CHTC of the fluid is known. Unfortunately it is not easy to \nmeasure or calculate this value and even order of \nmagnitude estimation is considered to be difficult. Therefore \nmost previous research has concentrated on the energy \npartition of the total grinding heat in order to estimate the\ntemperatures, whilst the energy partition coefficient is \nusually obtained by matching the theoretical and measured \ntemperatures within the grinding zone [1-3]. \nIn this paper, the CHTCs of fluids under different grinding \nconditions have been predicted by coupled fluid dynamic \nand thermal modelling. A special test rig, with \nthermocouples embedded at different distances to the \ngrinding surface, has been used to measure the heat flux to \nthe workpiece, which is used to calculate the CHTCs of \ngrinding fluids. The theoretical predictions show good \nagreement with the experimental results. It has been found \nthat, the CHTCs under forced convection conditions due to \nthe high grinding wheel speeds are much higher than the \nvalues previously reported.\n2 COUPLED HYDROTHERMAL MODELING TO PREDICT \nTHE CHTC OF GRINDING FLUIDS\n Figure 1 shows the temperature profile of the grinding fluid\nin the thermal boundary layer between the wheel and \nworkpiece surface. The workpiece surface temperature, Tw , \nis simplified as being uniformly distributed, while the bulk \ntemperature of grinding fluid outside the boundary layer is \nT\uf0a5.. \uf064t is the thickness of the thermal boundary layer at \nlocation x. The bulk velocity of grinding fluid is assumed \nequal to the grinding wheel peripheral speed vs , and this \nhas been validated in the hydrodynamic analysis for the \ngrinding fluid flow. At the workpiece surface, the local heat \nflux qf to the fluid can be expressed as \n   \uf028 \uf029\uf0a5\uf02d\uf03d\uf0fa\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\uf02d\uf03d TTh\nwy\nT\nkq wff\n                                      (1)\nwhere k is the thermal conductivity of coolant and hf is the \nconvection heat transfer coefficient. \n q\nT\uf0a5\nTw \uf064 t\n y\n x\n           \n y\n x\nCoolant\nWorkpiece\n vs\nGrinding \n  wheel\n O\nFigure 1: Thermal boundary layer of grinding fluid on the \nworkpiece surface.\nTo obtain the value of hf, the fluid temperature gradient at \nthe workpiece surface is needed.

Only the ram pressure of the jet issuing out of the \nnozzle was considered by Guo and Malkin, which is \nappropriate when using low wheel speeds and relatively \nporous wheels. However, in deep grinding, high nozzle \npressure and high wheel speed significantly increases the \neffects of the hydrodynamic pressure, which can not be \nignored.  In this paper the hydrodynamic pressure \ndeveloped in the thin film between the wheel and workpiece \nhas been taken into account.    \nThe Reynolds equation governing the hydrodynamic \npressure developed between the wheel and workpiece, \ncovering the angular range of DOE in Figure 4, can be \nwritten as [9 and10]\n\uf028 \uf029\uf028 \uf029\n\uf028 \uf029\uf028 \uf029\n     sin12\n  cos\n   cos6\n3\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\uf02d\n\uf0b6\n\uf02b\uf0b6\uf02b\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\uf02d\uf02d\uf03d\uf0f7\uf0f7\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\nR\nx\nv\nx\nvRxv\nH\nx\nH\nvRxv\nx\npH\nx\ns\nws\nws\uf06d                        (15)\n                          \nwhere H is the variable fluid film thickness at the entrance \nwedge, vw  is the worktable speed.

Figure 5(a) \nshows that the depth of fluid penetration at the junction point \nE (Figure 3), which determines the fluid film thickness within \nthe grinding zone, depends on the grinding wheel speed \n(0.015\uf07e0.05mm for wheel speed 60\uf07e30 m\/s). Due to the \ninfluence of hydrodynamic pressure the depth of fluid \npenetration is predicted to be much higher in Figures 5(b).\nThe upper bound value for the depth of fluid penetration is \nthe grinding gap H0 between wheel and work surface\n(Figure 4), which includes the effect of wheel porosity. For \nan average grain diameter d = 0.252 mm, the minimum H0 \uf0bb\nd\/2 \uf0bb 0.13mm for a non-porous wheel, although this could \nbe a much larger value for porous wheels.\n3 EXPERIMENTAL MEASUREMENTS OF THE CHTC OF \nGRINDING FLUIDS\nA special test rig, with three K type thermocouples (10 \uf06dm \nthick) embedded beneath the sample surface, has been \nused to measure the heat flux to the workpiece (Figure 6). \nThe rig is inclined at a 12\uf0b0 angle, so that the temperatures at \ndifferent depths from the ground surface can be measured.\nThe temperature readings from the three thermocouples \nwere used to obtain the heat flux entering the workpiece \nsurface,  qw : \n   \ny\nT\nk\nwy\nT\nkq www \uf044\n\uf044\uf02d\uf03d\uf0fa\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\uf02d\uf03d                                           (16)\nwhere kw is the thermal conductivity of the workpiece \nmaterial. The CHTC, hf, can then be obtained by using the \nfollowing expression. \n   \uf028 \uf029\uf0a5\uf02d\uf0d7\uf03d\uf02d\uf02d\uf02d\uf03d TThqqqqq wfchswtf                         (17)\nThe total heat flux, qt, was calculated from the specific \ngrinding energy, SGE, based on the spindle power \nmonitored and the grinding parameters [10]. The heat flux to \nthe abrasives, qs , was calculated by the Hahn model [11],\nand heat flux to grinding chips, qch, was estimated by \nassuming a constant chip temperature of 1000\uf0b0C. Tests \nwere carried out under creep-feed grinding mode, see Table \n1, to avoid fluid burn-out and achieve low temperatures. \nPrevious experimental study and detailed energy \npartitioning analysis shows that over 80-90% of the grinding \nenergy can be taken away by the grinding fluids in creep-\nfeed grinding [12, 13], the amount of heat taken away by the \ngrinding chips and abrasive wheel takes no more than 5-6% \nof the total heat flux and thus has no major effect on the \noverall accuracy of the CHTCs calculated.  \nThree types of waterbased fluid and a mineral oil have been \ntested. Table 2 lists the average values of the SGE and \nCHTCs from the tests. The fluid film thickness is estimated \nto be around 0.13-0.15mm. Thermal properties of water and \nmineral oil at room temperature were used for the \nprediction, as the measured grinding temperatures were \nless than 30\uf0b0C when using waterbased fluids and around \n40- 45\uf0b0C for the mineral oil.\nThe results of CHTCs for water based fluids (Table 2) are \nreasonably close to the predictions. The CHTC for mineral \noil was significantly increased when increasing the wheel \nspeed, which is inline with the theoretical analysis, as the \nfluid flow velocity enhances the forced convection behaviour \nof the fluids (Figure 7). The predicted values for both \nwaterbased fluid and mineral oil are higher than the \nmeasured values. The reason for this could be that the fluid \nvelocity is lower than the wheel speed, as the rough \nworkpiece surface texture being ground drags the fluid flow \nand also that the actual fluid film thickness can be larger\nthan 0.15mm due to the existence of the fluid entrance \nwedge shown in Figure 4.  \n                    \nFigure 6: Inclined thermocouple test rig.\n0 50 100 150\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nx 10\n5\nWheel speed (m\/s)\nC\nH\nT\nC\n (\nW\n\/m\n2.\nK\n)\n0.05 mm \n0.15 mm \n0.1 mm \n   \nFigure 7: Change of CHTC, hf , with wheel speed and fluid \nfilm thickness (mineral oil).                          \nFluid Vs \n(m\/s)\nSGE\n(J\/mm3)\nhf measured\n(x103W\/m2.K)\nhf predicted\n(x103W\/m2.K)\nWB 1 50   75.8  \u00b1 4%   283  \u00b15%       710 \nWB 2 50   104.6 \u00b14%   393  \u00b1 5%       710 \nWB 3 50   60.4  \u00b1 2%   229  \u00b1 3%       710 \nMO 50   36.9 \u00b117%   71.4 \u00b1 20%       220\nMO 146   73.9 \u00b1 9%   213 \u00b1 15%       380  \nTable 2: Results of CHTCs from the tests\n(WB: waterbased, MO: mineral oil).\n4 CONCLUSIONS\nBoth theoretical analysis and experimental measurements \nshow that the values of the CHTCs can be very high, much \nhigher than the values previously reported. The CHTC \nvalues change with wheel speed and are also influenced by\nthe value of the fluid film thickness. This film thickness in \nturn can be a function of wheel speed, porosity, grain size, \ncoolant viscosity and flow rate. For deep grinding conditions \n(creep feed and HEDG), the upper bound value of fluid film \nthickness can be achieved due to the high coolant supply \npressure and flow rate.   The predicted CHTC values and \ntrends show a relatively good agreement with the values \nestimated using the experimental approach.   \nUnder the test conditions used in this study, the grinding \ntemperatures were below 45\uf0b0C, so the temperature \ndependence of the thermal properties of the fluids does not \nhave any significant effect on the CHTC predictions. The \nphysical properties, e.g., viscosity and thermal conductivity \nof grinding fluid seem to have a slightly stronger effect on \nthe sensitivity than the process parameters. \nThis preliminary study shows that it is possible to estimate \nthe CHTC values within the grinding zone by using a \ntheoretical analysis in combination with the experimental\napproach.\n6 ACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nThe authors would like to acknowledge the financial support\nfrom EPSRC and Cranfield IMRC.\n7 REFERENCES\n[1] Malkin, S., 1974, Thermal aspects of grinding.
