Introduction. \n \nWhile the primary impact of an economic change may be focused in a particular city or \nregion, its effects may also be felt in other regions.  There are interdependencies across \nplaces so that what happens in one region has implications not only for this location but \nfor other regions as well.  The objectives of this paper are to investigate these linkages, \nidentifying the channels through which these effects operate and their net impact. The \nissue is important because, as we will see, under some circumstances changes that \nbenefit one region also have positive effects on other areas.  When this complementary \nrelationship between regions holds, the impact of a shock is in some sense shared \nbetween regions. Under other circumstances, however, regions are in a competitive \nrather than a complementary relationship with one another.  A positive shock to one \nregion has a negative impact elsewhere, with the result that the effects on the first region \nare amplified at the expense of other regions. \nUnderstanding the circumstances under which these alternatives occur is crucial \nfor understanding regional inequalities, and for evaluating the effects of policy.  \nConsider two examples. A policy measure raises productivity and hence wages in one \ncity or region.  Does this increase wages in other regions also, or are spatial differences \nin wages amplified by population movement and consequent changes in earnings?  An \nexpansion in housing stock in a high price region is intended to narrow regional house \nprice differentials.  Does it do this, or is it offset \u2013 or even overturned \u2013 by induced \nmigration and higher earnings in the growing region?  The answers to these questions \nturn on whether regions are in a complementary or competing relationship with each \nother, terms that we will make precise in the course of the paper. \n Our technique for investigating these issues and establishing the relationship \n 3 \nbetween regions is primarily diagrammatic.  We develop a framework that shows how \ntwo regions in an economy interact, and illustrates how there can be equilibrium spatial \ndisparities.  We use the framework to analyse the effect of a change in one region on \nanother and to show how \u2013 depending on a few key elasticities \u2013 equilibrium adjustment \nmay dampen or amplify shocks. \n The framework is based on three key relationships.  The first is the \u2018earnings-\nemployment\u2019 relationship, which captures the supply side of the economy.  The form of \nthis relationship depends critically on whether there are increasing or decreasing returns \nto expanding employment in a region.  The second is the \u2018cost-of-living\u2019 relationship, \nwhich captures the effects of levels of employment on prices of goods and assets in the \nregion.  It depends on characteristics of goods markets and, above all, land and housing \nmarkets.  The third is the \u2018migration relationship\u2019, linking population movements \nbetween regions. \nWe express each of these relationships in a \u2018reduced form\u2019 way, and show how \nthe interaction between regions depends on the shape of the relationships.  Our focus is \non the long-run equilibrium of the economy and, for clarity, we abstract from many of \nthe real life frictions that may arise from imperfect information or adjustment costs. \nThis approach has, we hope, the benefits of being relatively accessible and independent \nof the details of particular modelling approaches.  However, these reduced form \nrelationships summarise the micro-economic detail of a wide range of economic \nmodels, and it is important that they are linked to models in the literature.  The later \nsections of the paper relate these relationships to the theoretical underpinnings provided \nin the literatures on economic geography, regional economics, and urban systems, and \nto the empirical quantification of these relationships. \n \n 4 \n2.   Linkages: a Diagrammatic Approach. \n \nThe main objective of the paper is to develop an analytical framework that can be used \nto understand the equilibrium of a multi-region economy and establish the comparative \nstatic effects of \u2018shocks\u2019 to one of the regions.  The text develops the argument \ndiagrammatically for a two region economy, while a more general algebraic analysis for \na multi-region economy is presented in the appendix.  We shall refer to the two regions, \nas N and S.  The total labour force in the economy is fixed at unity and can be divided \nbetween the two regions with S having share \u03bb and N having 1 - \u03bb.   We will assume that \nthe labour force in each region is proportional to both population and employment, \nthereby abstracting from differences in demographic structure, in regional participation \nor employment rates, or commuting between regions.1   \nWe focus on three key \u2018reduced form\u2019 relationships which can be captured in a \nfour quadrant diagram.  \n \nEarnings-employment (EE):  The first relationship we refer to as the earnings-\nemployment relationship and it determines the wage that is paid to workers in a region \nas a function of the labour force in the region. Denoting wage rates in N and S by wN \nand wS , the earnings-employment relationship can be written as: \n  \n)(\u03bbwaw SS = ,      )1( \u03bb\u2212= waw NN      (1) \n \nwhere aN and aS are productivity parameters, and the function w(.) gives the relationship \nbetween earnings and employment.  We will denote the elasticity of this relationship \nby w\u03b7 , noting that the elasticity may vary with \u03bb.  The shape of this relationship depends \n 5 \non technology and market interactions. For example, if product and labour markets are \nperfectly competitive and there are diminishing returns to labour then the function gives \nthe marginal value product of labour, and w\u03b7  \u2264 0.\n2   If there are increasing returns \n(internal or external to firms) then it is possible that w\u03b7  > 0, and we discuss the forces \nthat shape the relationship in this case in section 5.  The relationship also depends on the \nmobility of other factors of production.  In the within-country context we think of \ncapital markets as being integrated, so the rate of return is the same in all regions and \nany diminishing returns would come from regionally immobile factors of production. 3 \n \nThe earnings-employment relationship is illustrated in the top left quadrant of \nfigure 1 by curve EE.  Because we are interested in the linkages between regions the \nfigure is constructed in terms of the division of the labour force between regions, and \nthe relative values of the price variables in each region.  Thus, the horizontal axis of the \ntop-left quadrant is \u03bb, the share of the labour force in S, and the vertical is relative \nwages, wS \/wN .  That is: \n \nEE:  ( )( ) )()1(\/)(\/\/ \u03bb\u03bb\u03bb Wwwaaww NSNS \u2261\u2212= ,    (2) \n \nwhere the function W(\u03bb) summarises the relationship and is assumed to be invertible.  \nThe interpretation of the relationship is straightforward.  Given a division of the labour \nforce between the two regions, \u03bb, the curve shows the associated relative wage wS \/wN .  \nThe case illustrated is one with diminishing marginal returns to labour, w\u03b7  < 0, so that \nan expansion of relative employment in S leads to a fall in the relative wage in S.  We \nwill look at the case where w\u03b7  > 0 in section 3. \n \n 6 \n \nCost of living (HH): High relative earnings in a region should encourage migration into \nthat region, but migration in turn has implications for the cost of living.  There are \nseveral mechanisms through which population can affect the cost of living, the most \ndirect of which is through the fact that people consume space. Increasing the labour \nforce in a region bids up the prices of houses (and residential land) and so raises the cost \nof living.  This relationship is steeper the less elastic is housing supply (eg due to \nplanning regulations) and the greater is the share of housing in expenditure.   \nWe denote the cost of living in each region by hS , hN  and assume, for the \nmoment, that it is a function only of the labour force in the region. Thus,  \n \n( )SS bhh \/\u03bb= ,      ( )NN bhh \/)1( \u03bb\u2212=      (3) \n \nwhere, once again, bS and bN  are shift parameters and  h(.) is the functional relationship \nlinking the cost of living to the labour force. The elasticity of the cost of living with \nrespect to the labour force is denoted h\u03b7 , and may vary with \u03bb.  The parameters bS and  \nbN  can be interpreted as exogenous factors that shift the supply of (or demand for) land, \nso an equiproportional increase in bS and \u03bb has no effect on the cost of living in S.  \nTaking the ratio of these expressions,   \n \nHH:  ( ) ( ) )(\/)1(\/\/\/ \u03bb\u03bb\u03bb Hbhbhhh NSNS \u2261\u2212=     (4) \n \nwhere the function H(\u03bb) summarises the relationship, and is assumed to be invertible. \nThis relationship is illustrated in the bottom right quadrant of figure 1, drawn \nwith 0>h\u03b7 , so that greater population is associated with higher cost of living. \n 7 \nWhile we have written the cost of living as a function of the labour force, \u03bb, \nnotice that the expression can be interpreted more generally.  For example, the demand \nfor housing may depend also on wages. Indeed, as we discuss in section 5, the income \neffect on prices may even be bigger than the population effect. However, as wages are \nthemselves a function of \u03bb (equation (1)), the function h(.) is a reduced form that can \nincorporate these effects. The implications for the shape of h(.) will depend on the \nnature of the function w(.) as discussed in the appendix.4  Other factors may also enter \nthis relationship, including goods prices and intra-regional commuting costs, and these \nare, again, discussed further in section 5. \n \nMigration (MM):  We assume that workers are potentially mobile between regions and \nthat they move in response to real wage differences between regions.  Long run \nequilibrium occurs therefore when real wages, adjusted by amenity values, are equalised \nacross regions. Since real wages are nominal wages divided by the cost of living index, \nthe migration equilibrium schedule is determined by the condition, \n \nMM: NNNSSS hwchwc \/\/ =  or equivalently ( )( )SNNSNS cchhww \/\/\/ = ,  (5) \n \nwhere cS and  cN  are shift parameters that reflect, for example, amenities in the two \nregions.  If cS = cN  then this migration equilibrium schedule is simply the 45% line as \nillustrated by the line MM in the top right hand quadrant of figure 1.  Above the line \nworkers in S are better off than those in N , so there is a tendency for migration from N \nto S, and conversely below the line. \nWith three economic relationships for three pairs of endogenous variables (the \nlabour force in each region, wages and costs of living) the fourth quadrant is \n 8 \nconceptually redundant, and the line LL is simply the 45o line, matching values of \u03bb \nacross quadrants. \n \nFigures 1 and 2 here \n \n3.  Equilibrium. \n \nTogether, these relationships determine the long run equilibrium distribution of workers \nbetween regions and the associated levels of earnings and costs of living.  The full long \nrun equilibrium of this system occurs when values of \u03bb, wS \/wN , and hS \/hN  are \nconsistent with all relationships holding simultaneously. This long run equilibrium \ncould take time to achieve if people do not respond instantly to real wage differentials.  \nIf adjustment takes time, expectations may matter for both the nature of long run \nequilibrium and for the adjustment path between equilibria (e.g. whether there is \novershooting). These issues, while beyond the scope of this paper, are certainly \ninteresting and the subject of a small but growing literature. Henceforth, we abstract \nfrom them and consider only the long run equilibrium as defined here.5  \nIn the simplest case, in which the two regions are symmetric (aS \/aN = bS \/bN  = \ncS \/cN  = 1) there is an equilibrium at which \u03bb = \u00bd and relative values of all price \nvariables are unity. Before applying the framework we need to spend some time \noutlining how equilibrium is attained, and distinguishing between three different cases \u2013 \ndistinctions that will be crucial when we come to comparative static analysis. \n \n3.1  Complementary regions: \n 9 \nFigure 1 illustrates the case of \u2018complementary regions\u2019.  The equilibrium is shown by \nthe points indicated by circles and joined by the dashed lines.   \nTo understand the diagram it is helpful to consider the following thought \nexperiment. Suppose that the initial situation is one in which employment in S is \nrelatively high, as at point A on the LL curve. Tracing up to the EE curve gives the value \nof relative wages corresponding to relative employment at A. Similarly, tracing over to \nthe HH curve gives the relative cost of living.  Looking at the MM quadrant, we see that \nthese levels of relative wages and living costs correspond to the point A\u2019 which is below \nthe MM curve, meaning that real wages in N are above those in S.   As we move point A \nalong the LL line in the bottom left quadrant, relative wages and relative living costs \nchange, tracing out the dashed curve ZZ in the top right quadrant. Thus the ZZ curve \ntraces out combinations of relative wages and relative living costs, given the \nemployment-earnings and cost of living relationships.   \n Now, recall that the MM curve gives the combinations of relative wages and \nrelative living costs at which real incomes in the two regions are equal.  Thus, the long \nrun equilibrium must be at the intersection of MM and this derived curve ZZ.  At this \npoint relative wages and living costs are consistent with the division of the labour force \nbetween regions, and there is no incentive for workers to migrate from one region to the \nother. \nNotice that this equilibrium is stable, in the sense that labour migration is an \nequilibrating force.  To see this, once again consider starting at labour allocation A. \nWorkers in S have a lower level of real income than workers in N (point A\u2019). As a result, \nworkers migrate from S to N moving the economy along the LL line in the direction of \nthe arrow.  As \u03bb declines, wS \/wN  increases (the EE relationship) and  hS \/hN  falls (the \n 10 \nHH relationship), moving along ZZ in the direction of the arrow until the equilibrium is \nreached.     \nFor reasons that will become clear when we turn to comparative statics, we \ndefine the configuration illustrated in figure 1 as the \u2018complementary case\u2019.  The aspect \nof the configuration that matters for comparative statics is that the ZZ curve is \ndownwards sloping. The ZZ relationship is derived by eliminating \u03bb from the EE and \nHH curves, \n \nZZ:                                 ( )( )1\/ \/S N S Nw w W H h h\u2212= ,                           (6) \n \nwhere ( )( ).1\u2212HW  is the composition of the W function in equation (2) and the inverse of \nthe H function in equation (4).  If the functions w(.) and h(. ) are isoelastic, so the EE \nand HH equations, (2) and (4), are respectively \n \n( )( ) WNSNS aaww \u03b7\u03bb\u03bb )1\/(\/\/ \u2212= , ( ) ( ) hhNSNS bbhh \u03b7\u03b7 \u03bb\u03bb )1\/(\/\/ \u2212= \u2212 ,  \n \nthen the ZZ relationship takes the form, \n  \nZZ:                        ( )( ) ( ) \/\/ \/ \/ \/w w hS N S N S N S Nw w a a b b h h\n\u03b7 \u03b7 \u03b7= .   (6\u2019) \n \nIn our analysis we do not impose that these functions are globally isoelastic \u2013 some of \nthe curvatures illustrated in following diagrams certainly violate this property.  The \nisoelastic form is nevertheless useful as a way of capturing relationships in the \nneighbourhood of the symmetric equilibrium.  At this point, elasticities have the same \n 11 \nvalues in both regions, and we will describe the slopes of relationships at the symmetric \nequilibrium in terms of elasticities.  Thus, from now on elasticities are always \nunderstood to be evaluated in the neighbourhood of the symmetric equilibrium.  The \nconfiguration of figure 1 therefore holds because the ZZ schedule is downward sloping \nat the symmetric equilibrium, i.e.  0\/ <hw \u03b7\u03b7 .  Notice that, if 0>h\u03b7 , then this \nobviously requires a negative elasticity of earnings with respect to employment,  \n0<w\u03b7 . \n \n3.2   Competing regions: \nThe case illustrated in figure 1 assumes that there are diminishing marginal returns to \nlabour ( 0<w\u03b7 ), so that along the EE curve higher levels of employment are associated \nwith lower wages.  But at the heart of much of the literature on urban systems and new \neconomic geography is the idea that this relationship may be positive as a consequence \nof increasing, rather than diminishing, returns to activity in an area.  The mechanisms \nunderlying this are discussed in more detail in section 5, but for now we simply \nconsider the implications of this for the equilibrium.  The EE curve is now positively-\nsloped as shown in figure 2, and so higher relative employment in S also implies higher \nrelative wages.  The change in the slope of the EE curve affects the slope of ZZ schedule \nand this has major implications for the comparative static properties of the model as we \nshall see in section 4.  It is the positive slope of the ZZ schedule that defines this case as \n\u2018competing regions\u2019 and, in terms of elasticities this occurs when 0\/ >hw \u03b7\u03b7  (equation \n(6\u2019)); if 0>h\u03b7 , then this obviously requires a positive elasticity of earnings with respect \nto employment, 0>w\u03b7 . \n 12 \nAlthough the slope of the ZZ curve has reversed, the equilibrium illustrated in \nfigure 2 is still stable.  Relatively high values of \u03bb map into points on ZZ below the MM \nline, meaning that real incomes in S are low relative to those in N and so there is \nmigration from S to N which moves \u03bb towards its equilibrium value.  This stability \ncomes about because the slope of ZZ is less than that of MM, and for this we require that \nthe elasticities satisfy 0>> wh \u03b7\u03b7 .  That is, as the labour force in a region increases, the \ncost of living needs to rise proportionately faster than earnings. Again, for reasons that \nwill become clear when we turn to comparative statics, we refer to this situation as the \n\u201ccompeting case\u201d. \n  \n3.3 Divergent regions: \nThe symmetric equilibrium of this model is unstable if increasing returns in the \nearnings-employment relationship are sufficiently strong, relative to the increasing costs \nin the cost of living relationship.  This case is illustrated in figure 3. The EE curve is as \nin figure 2 but the cost of living curve, HH, is drawn differently.  For the moment, focus \nonly on the area around the symmetric equilibrium and note that the cost of living now \nresponds less sharply to population changes.  This in turn produces a ZZ schedule which \nis steeper than the MM curve, and as a result the symmetric equilibrium is unstable.  In \nthis case, if \u03bb is relatively high then ZZ lies above MM; real incomes in S are above \nthose in N and migration from N to S increases \u03bb further.  This situation results when the \nunderlying parameters are such that 1\/ >hw \u03b7\u03b7 . \n If the equilibrium is unstable, what happens?  There may be no other \nintersection of the MM and ZZ curves in which case one of the regions empties out, with \n\u03bb going to zero or one.  Alternatively, it may be the case that as population levels in the \ntwo regions become very unequal, the cost-of-living becomes more responsive to \n 13 \nfurther changes in population, resulting in a \u2018bendy shaped\u2019  HH curve, as shown in \nfigure 3.6   This shape transfers to the ZZ curve, and implies that there are two \nasymmetric equilibria, in addition to the symmetric equilibrium already discussed.  \nThese are both stable (ZZ is less steep than MM at the point of intersection) and \n\u2018competing\u2019 (ZZ has positive gradient, as in figure 2).  Thus, regions with similar \nunderlying characteristics may be observed to have quite different population levels, \nwages and living costs. \n \n Figures  3 & 4 here \n \n3.4 Regime summary: \nFigure 4 summarises the relationship between the slopes of the relationships (measured \nby elasticities at the symmetric equilibrium) and the complementary, competing and \ndivergent cases we have outlined.  If 0>h\u03b7 , as assumed in all the figures in the paper, \nthen increasing w\u03b7  moves the system from complementary to competing to divergent, \nas illustrated.  Increasing returns, 0>w\u03b7 , is necessary for regions to be competing and \nif these are strong enough they overturn the force for dispersion captured by 0>h\u03b7 , \ngiving divergence.  If  0<h\u03b7  then this force for dispersion is removed, and regimes are \nas illustrated on the left hand side of figure 4.  The models underlying this case \u2013 in \nparticular KRUGMAN\u2019s, 1991a core-periphery model \u2013 are discussed in section 5. \n \n4.   Regional Linkages. \n \nWe now turn to investigating the comparative static properties of the model.  To do this \nwe assume that one region (S) is affected by some exogenous \u2018shock\u2019, and then see how \n 14 \ninter-regional economic adjustment restores the equilibrium of the economy.  For \nobvious reasons we only look at changes to a stable equilibrium, and we commence \nwith a shock that shifts the EE relationship, i.e. a productivity shock. \n \n(Figures 5 a and b here) \n \n4.1 Productivity shock: \nRegion S experiences a positive productivity shock, such as an infrastructure investment \nor some other supply side improvement. The direct effect of the shock is to shift the EE \nschedule upwards, as illustrated by the vertical arrows in figure 5a (for the case where \nthe regions are complementary) and figure 5b (competing regions).  This shows that at \ngiven employment levels, the earnings of labour in S are increased.  This upwards shift \nin EE shifts the ZZ schedule upwards by an identical amount7, and the new (long-run) \nequilibrium is at the intersection of this new ZZ schedule and the MM line (illustrated by \nthe outer rectangle of dashed lines in figures 5a and 5b)   Qualitatively, the effects of the \npositive shock to productivity are as expected.  There is an increase in wages in both \nregions and an increase in relative wages in S, wS \/wN.  There is migration to S, and \nhence an increase \u03bb, population and employment in S.  This in turn leads to an increase \nin the relative cost of living in S, hS\/hN, offsetting the change in relative wages.   \nHow does the shape of each of the relationships EE and HH affect the nature of \nthe linkages between areas?  For the complementary case illustrated in figure 5a, the \nrelative wage change is smaller than the initial productivity shock, as can be seen by \ncomparing the magnitude of the shifts in EE and ZZ with the associated wage change.  \nThis is the complementary relationship: a beneficial shock in S first increases wages in \nS, but then interregional migration draws labour into S from N, and as it does so wages \n 15 \nin S fall and wages in N rise, partially offsetting the initial effect of the shock.  At the \nsame time, these population movements produce changes in relative costs of living with \nhouse prices in S increasing while those in N decline, offsetting the change in relative \nwages.  Overall, the beneficial shock in S produces higher real wages in both regions, \nwith higher employment and house prices in S, but an absolute fall in employment and \nhouse prices in N.   The magnitude of the changes depends on the elasticities of the \nrelationships.  For example, if housing supply is very price inelastic then the HH curve \nis flat, and small changes in relative population cause large changes in relative living \ncosts.  In this case, the shock is associated with small changes in relative populations, \u03bb, \nand relatively large changes (and consequent differences) in both wages and living \ncosts.  Conversely, very price elastic house supply means that the shock causes large \nmovements in population and small long run differences in costs of living and wages.  \nIn the limit with HH and hence ZZ vertical, relative costs of living are unchanged and \npopulation movement brings wages back to equality.   \nHow are things different in the case of competing regions?  It is helpful to think \nfirst about the borderline case, in which the EE schedule is horizontal. Relative wages \ndo not depend on employment levels, so the change in relative wages must be equal to \nthe productivity shock.  All adjustment occurs through population movement and its \nconsequent effects on living costs.  When the EE relationship is positively-sloped then \nwe move from the complementary case of figure 5a to the competing region case of \nfigure 5b.  The productivity shock draws labour to S from N as before, but now this \nmigration causes further increases in earnings in S, while decreasing earnings in N.  The \nprice changes are therefore relatively large, and in particular the wage changes are \namplified.  Wages in S rise by more than the initial productivity shock, while wages in \nN decline as labour emigrates. Correspondingly large changes in relative population and \n 16 \nin the cost of living are necessary therefore in order to equate real wages and restore \nequilibrium.   \nAlgebraic expressions for all these effects are given in the appendix, and are \nsummarised in Table 1.  The productivity shock is of magnitude Sa\u02c6  (^ denotes a \nproportional change).  If 0w <\u03b7  (complementary regions, figure 1 and 5a) then there is \na less than proportional increase in wages in S (i.e. SS wa \u02c6\u02c6 > ) and wages in N rise.  But \nif  0w >\u03b7  (competing regions, figures 2 and 5b) then migration amplifies (rather than \nmoderates) the effect in S, giving a larger than proportional wage increase in S and wage \nreduction in N, NSS waw \u02c60\u02c6\u02c6 >>> .  In both cases the cost of living (and house prices) in \nS increase while they fall in N, the magnitude of these effects being greater the larger is \nw\u03b7 .  The change in the relative living costs in the two regions, NS hh \u02c6\u02c6 \u2212 , is less than the \nproductivity shock if regions are complementary, but greater than the productivity \nshock if regions are competing. \n 17 \nTable 1 here \nFigures 6 a and b here \n \n4.2 Land supply shock: \nAs a second experiment, we consider the effect of a shock that enables S to have a \nhigher population with unchanged cost of living.  Perhaps the best example of this is a \nchange in land use regulations that allows S to expand the stock of land available for \nhousing.  The effect is to shift the HH curve left or downwards (a lower cost of living \nfor the same size labour force), this translating into a similar size shift to the left of the \nZZ curve.   \nThe effects for complementary regions are illustrated in figure 6a, and the new \nequilibrium is at the points on the dashed rectangle lying to the \u201csouth-west\u201d of the old \nequilibrium.  The effects can be traced out as follows.  With given population, the shock \nleads to a fall in house prices in S, reducing living costs and raising real wages. This \nleads to migration to S from N and, with diminishing returns to labour, wages fall in S \nand increase in N.  The net result (once real wages are equalised by migration) is lower \nhouse prices and lower cost of living in both regions, with the house price decline \ngreater in S than in N, to compensate for the lower wages in S (row 1, table 2). \nIf regions are competing then results change radically.  With an upwards sloping \nEE curve (figure 6b) the shift establishes the new equilibrium on the outer rectangle of \ndashed lines.  As before, the initial fall in house prices in S leads to in-migration, but \nthis now raises earnings in S and reduces them in N, widening the gap in real wages. \nThis attracts further inflows of labour, and the process is equilibrated only when the \nrelative cost of living in S has increased sufficiently, as shown in the figure.  Increasing \nthe stock of housing in S must therefore increase the relative cost of living in S, hS \/hN .  \n 18 \nIf the EE schedule is sufficiently steep, the new equilibrium requires that absolute house \nprices in S increase in response to the construction of more houses!  The intuition here \nis that of agglomeration.  Increasing returns are large enough that population continues \nto flow into the region until choked off by higher house prices.  Formally, this case \narises if Khw \/\u03b7\u03b7 > , where K is the number of regions (so K = 2 in the diagrammatic \nanalysis).  This is a condition that is quite consistent with stability of equilibrium, and \nthe full listing of possibilities is given in table 2.   \nTable 2 here \n These two examples illustrate the importance of understanding whether regions \nare complementary or competing and show how qualitative, as well as quantitative, \neffects of policy change depend on the elasticities of some key relationships.  Similar \nanalyses can be conducted for other parameter changes \u2013 such as amenity changes \u2013 or \nfor combined packages of policy change.  Rather than undertaking more of these \nexercises, we now turn to the mechanisms underlying our reduced form relationships. \n \n 19 \n5.   The Earnings \u2013 Employment Relationship  \n \nThe analysis presented above is based on reduced form relationships.  While there has \nbeen a long tradition in the urban systems literature of using such reduced forms for \nmodelling purposes (see, e.g., HENDERSON, 1998), more recent literature seeks to go \nbehind these relationships. In the remainder of the paper we consider the mechanisms \nthat underpin these reduced form relationships and link these to the existing literature, \ntheoretical and empirical.   We start with the EE schedule which, as we have seen, is \ncrucial in determining whether regions are complementary, competing or divergent.   \nA standard perfectly competitive model of production implies that additional \nemployment in a region either reduces earnings or leaves them unchanged, 0\u2264w\u03b7 . This \nis because, with non-increasing returns to scale, perfect competition, and some \nregionally fixed factor (call it capital), adding labour to a region increases the labour-\ncapital ratio, thereby reducing the marginal product of labour.  If capital were mobile or \nadditional labour could be employed by changing the sectoral structure of production \nwhile holding labour-capital ratios in each sector constant (as in Heckscher-Ohlin trade \ntheory) then earnings would be independent of employment, 0=w\u03b7 .\n8   \nOnce we move outside the standard competitive framework it is possible that \nincreased employment may be associated with higher wages, and the literature focuses \non three basic mechanisms -- a classification that fits with that of MARSHALL (1890). \nThe first is a market failure in the product market, modelled in the \u2018new economic \ngeography\u2019 literature as an interaction between firm-level returns to scale and transport \ncosts (section 5.1).  The second is market failure in input markets, particularly the \nlabour market (section 5.2), and the third is a range of technological externalities \n(section 5.3).   \n 20 \n \n5.1 New economic geography: \nAt the heart of \u2018new economic geography\u2019 models is a trade-off between two features.  \nFirst, production within firms exhibits increasing returns to scale, implying that each \nfirm wants to concentrate its production in one location, not spread it between many.  \nSecond, there are trade costs in shipping goods, implying that firms gain from \nproducing close to their markets.  The combined effect of these two features is that \nfirms seek to locate in regions with good market access, and this will tend to bid up \nwages in these regions.  But good market access is itself a consequence of having a \nlarge population.  This provides the basis for a positive relationship between population \nand wages \u2013 i.e. an upward-sloping EE schedule. \nThe formal modeling of this follows from KRUGMAN, 1991a.  The \nmanufacturing sector contains firms that have increasing returns to scale and produce \ndifferentiated products, as in DIXIT and STIGLITZ, 1977. Product differentiation \nmeans that firms engage in intra-industry trade, with each firm supplying all regions, \nalthough the presence of transport costs means that firms\u2019 sales are skewed towards \ntheir \u2018home\u2019 market.  The industry is monopolistically competitive, so the number of \nfirms in each location is determined by a zero profit condition. 9  This condition is the \nkey part of the EE relationship, and in the literature is sometimes referred to as the wage \nequation (FUJITA et al., 1999).  It implicitly defines the wage at which firms in each \nregion make zero profits, and this wage is an increasing function of regional expenditure \nor market size.  Adding an income\/ expenditure relationship which makes expenditure \nin each region an increasing function of employment, gives a positive relationship \nbetween employment and earnings, 0>w\u03b7  and makes regions competing rather than \ncomplementary. \n 21 \nKrugman\u2019s model is a fully specified general equilibrium model, from which it \nis possible to derive exact conditions under which the relationship between regions \nswitches from being competing to being divergent, with clustering of manufacturing \nactivity in one region.  This turns out to be more likely the greater is the proportion of \neconomic activity that is mobile (e.g. non-agricultural activity) and the lower are \ntransport costs.  One of the main points that Krugman sought to make was that \neconomic integration \u2013 lowering transport costs \u2013 could trigger regional divergence. \nThe Krugman model has been developed in many directions, and we note just \ntwo of them.  One is that the results are not dependent on the standard Dixit-Stiglitz \nmodel of product differentiation and monopolistic competition.  The fact that a large \nmarket is attractive to firms, so leading to higher equilibrium wages in the larger \nmarket, holds for other forms of competitive interaction between firms (IRMEN and \nTHISSE, 1998, COOMBES and LAFOURCADE, 2003). \nAnother extension was to add intermediate goods (VENABLES 1996, \nKRUGMAN and VENABLES, 1995).  In the basic Krugman model proximity to a \nlarge market tends to raise profits (or, with free entry, wages).  The presence of \nintermediate goods means that market size depends not just on final consumers, but also \non the presence of other firms who demand intermediate goods, and the effect of this is \nto amplify the value of being in an economically large region.  Furthermore, firms also \nsave transport costs from locating close to their suppliers. These effects (sometimes \nreferred to as forward and backward linkages) serve to create increasing returns within \nand between manufacturing sectors, so much so that agglomeration of manufacturing \ncan occur even if labour is immobile.  The main point for current purposes is that the \npresence of intermediate goods amplifies the positive relationship between earnings and \nemployment, so will tend to make w\u03b7  larger. \n 22 \n \n5.2  Thick market effects: \nLarge markets are often more efficient than small markets \u2013 an argument that applies in \nlabour and capital markets as well as in product markets.  In equilibrium, these \u2018thick \nmarket effects\u2019 translate into a positive relationship between a region\u2019s labour force and \nthe wage rate.  A number of mechanisms have been explored in the literature.  One is \nmatching; the larger the pool of workers that a firm can access the more likely it is to be \nable to find the exact skills that suits its needs (HELSLEY and STRANGE, 1990; \nAMITI and PISSARIDES, 2005).  Another is risk sharing; if firms are subject to \nidiosyncratic shocks then a larger labour market exposes workers to less risk by \nincreasing the probability of re-employment if they are made redundant (KRUGMAN, \n1991b.  Perhaps the most important argument is that a large labour market increases the \nincentives for workers to undertake training.  In a small market, workers who acquire \nspecialist skills may be \u2018held-up\u2019 by monopsonistic employers, in which case there is no \nincentive for them to invest in skills.  The presence of a large number of potential \nemployers removes this threat of opportunistic behaviour, and thereby increases the \nincentives for skill acquisition (MATOUSCHEK and ROBERT-NICOUD 2005).  \n \n5.3 Knowledge spillovers and externalities: \nThe third set of arguments underlying a positive EE relationship is something of a \ncatch-all residual category.  Knowledge spillovers are easier between proximate firms \nthan remote ones.  The mechanism may be labor mobility, face-to-face social contact \nbetween workers, or ability to observe the practices of other firms.  Such effects are \nparticularly important in innovation intensive activities, and a large literature points to \nthe resulting spatial concentration of innovative activities (e.g. AUDRETSCH and \n 23 \nFELDMAN, 2004).  Location specific knowledge spillovers also arise as firms learn \nabout the characteristics of knowledge transmission (GLAESER, 1999).  Much work \n(including JACOBS, 1969) focuses on cities as centres of innovative activity.  These \napproaches are surveyed in DURANTON and PUGA, 2004 and their implications for \nurban systems analysed in ABDEL-RAHMAN and ANAS, 2004.   \n Of course, high levels of population and employment create some negative \nexternalities as well as positive ones, most obviously because of congestion.  The \nmagnitude and balance between these effects is thus an empirical matter.  This is the \nissue to which we now turn.   \n \n5.4  The EE relationship: The empirical evidence: \nEmpirically, what do we know about the EE relationship?  That is, what can the data tell \nus about the relationship between the size of a city\/region and the productivity of firms \nand hence the level of earnings within the locality? \nOne approach to this problem is to estimate the production function directly with \ntotal factor productivity (the value of production for given inputs of labour and capital) \nmodelled as a function of variables related to city\/region size, for example \npopulation\/employment density.   The unit of observation might be the firm, the city-\nindustry or the city.  Regardless, in general terms, this involves estimating a relationship \nof the form: \n \nValue of production = f (labour, skills, capital, density, diversity, specialisation, sector \nspecific variables, city fixed effects, time dummies)  (7) \n \n 24 \nFollowing this approach yields a number of findings. The net effect of density on total \nfactor productivity is estimated to be positive (ROSENTHAL and STRANGE, 2004). \nThis observation confirms that cities exist because there are productivity advantages \nwhen economic agents are located together (agglomeration economies) that more than \noffset the congestion costs associated with higher densities.  That is, cities are not just \nabout shared public goods and\/or rent seeking.   Furthermore, cities are different sizes \nbecause the extent of agglomeration economies varies across different production \nactivities (ROSENTHAL and STRANGE, 2004). Some production activities \n(particularly in high-tech sectors) benefit from being in places where lots of similar \nactivity is taking place (localisation economies) while others benefit from locating in a \ndiverse environment (urbanisation economies) (HENDERSON, 2003).  The largest \ncities tend to be diversified, while smaller cities are more specialised. (DURANTON \nand PUGA, 2000,  2001). \nThe major drawback of the \u2018production function\u2019 approach is that it is very \ndemanding in terms of data.  Obtaining measures of capital stock at the city\/region level \nis particularly problematic.  An alternative approach is to work directly with the \nrelationship between wages and employment\/population. In this case, the general form \nof the relationship is: \n \nWage = f (labour, skills, density, diversity, specialisation, sector specific variables,   \n   city fixed effects, time dummies)      (8) \n \nComparing this to the specification in equation (7), the only differences are that the \nwage is the dependent variable and measures of capital stock are no longer included on \n 25 \nthe right-hand side.  This relationship has sound theoretical foundations providing the \nprice of capital is the same in all cities\/regions.    \nLooking across this literature, there is strong evidence of a positive relationship \nbetween earnings and employment\/population at the city\/region level. Doubling \npopulation density increases wages by between 3 and 6%. For evidence relating to the \nUS, see CICCONE and HALL, 1995; for selected EU countries, see CICCONE, 2002; \nfor the UK, see RICE et al, 2006; for France, see COMBES, DURANTON and \nGOBILLON, 2004.  There is some evidence of direct interaction across neighbouring \nlocations.10  Ciccone identifies an additional effect of approximately 3% from the \nemployment density of neighbouring regions. However, these effects appear to decline \nsteeply with distance. In the case of the UK, for example, RICE et al, 2006 find no \nevidence of effects between locations more than 80 minutes apart in terms of travel \ntime.  Decreasing travel time or distance by 10% between regions results in predicted \nproductivity gains of 1.14% and 0.24% in the UK and France, respectively. \nAnalysis of relationships such as (7) and (8) requires that we control carefully \nfor differences in the skill composition of the workforce across locations.   Evidence \nfrom RICE et al, 2006 suggests that one third of UK regional inequalities in earnings \ncan be explained by differences in skill composition.  For France, COMBES et al, 2004 \nsuggest a somewhat larger effect, with around 50% of regional inequality explained by \ndifferences in skills, while urbanisation and localisation economies explain about 20%. \nControlling for skill is inherently problematic because of sorting effects.  Formal \nmeasures of training or occupation only capture part of workers\u2019 abilities, and if there is \na positive correlation between the unmeasured part of ability and workers\u2019 decisions to \nlive in large urban areas, then  econometric work will tend to overstate the productivity \neffects of cities.  \n 26 \nThe approaches reviewed above focus on the static aspects of agglomeration \neconomies. There is another strand of literature on agglomeration economies concerned \nwith the dynamics of urban growth. A simple specification to study the role of dynamic \nexternalities can be derived by assuming local externalities affect the growth rate, rather \nthan the level of productivity: i.e. \n \nGrowth in the value of production between period t-s and period t = f (density at time t-\ns, diversity at time t-s, specialisation at time t-s)  (9) \n \nThis approach is often applied to long-run growth rates, that is with s quite large and \nallowing the effects to differ across sectors. Unfortunately, data on production by \nregions and sectors is scarce and rarely available at different points in time. For these \nreasons, many studies analyse the growth of employment instead of the growth in \nproduction (GLAESER at al , 1992, HENDERSON et al, 1995). More recent studies use \ntime series econometrics to estimate full dynamic models of employment (for example: \nHENDERSON, 1997; COMBES et al, 2004). \n In summary, the existing evidence suggests that, at least for some range of city \nsizes, the EE relationship may well be upward sloping, 0>w\u03b7 .\n11  A number of \neconometric difficulties remain to be fully resolved (e.g. endogeneity, the need to \ncontrol for compositional characteristics) but the recent literature that has begun to \naddress these issues still points to a positive relationship.  \n \n 27 \n6.  The Cost of Living and Migration \n \nWhile much of the research effort has focussed on the relationship between employment \nand earnings, our analytical discussion makes clear that the role of migration and the \nrelationship between the cost-of-living and population size are also important in shaping \neconomic linkages across space.  In this section we briefly review the evidence relating \nto these although, relative to work on the EE curve, the literature tends to be more \neclectic in terms of methodology and applications. \n \n6.1 The cost-of-living and the HH relationship \nThe cost-of-living depends on product prices, the price of land and housing, and \nadditional costs such as commuting.  The original new economic geography models \n(KRUGMAN 1991a and following) ignored housing, rents, and intra-regional transport, \nso the costs of living are determined only by the price of goods.  This tends to generate \na negative HH relationship \u2013 regions with a large population have lower living costs \u2013 \nthe opposite of the relationship illustrated in the preceding figures.  There are three \nrelated arguments for this.  The first is that a large region tends to have lower transport \ncosts because a smaller proportion of goods are imported.  The second is that there is a \nwider range of products on offer (think of non-tradable goods such as restaurants) and, \ngiven that people like variety, these have the effect of bringing down the cost of \nproducing utility (and hence the true cost of living index).  The third is that competition \nbetween firms is more intense in a dense area of activity, and this brings down prices for \nconsumers.  \nWhile these product market factors are important, empirically they often seem to \nbe outweighed by considerations relating to land and housing, aspects that were crucial \n 28 \nin earlier work on urban and regional economics.12  A positive HH relationship could be \nbased on simply postulating an upwards-sloping supply of land for housing, so \nincreasing population raises its price.  An alternative, on which much of the urban \neconomics literature is based, supposes that the price of each marginal unit of land in \nthe area is constant.  However, commuting costs within each city create a premium on \ncity centre land.  Thus, in the simplest model, all employment takes place in the \u2018central \nbusiness district\u2019 (CBD).  Urban land rents adjust so that, in equilibrium, all individuals \nare indifferent about where in the city they are housed and, since commuting costs \nincrease with distance from the CBD, land rents must decline with distance.  What does \nthis imply for the relationship between city size and cost of living, that is the HH \nschedule?  In the simplest case (a linear city, equal size residential lots and commuting \ncosts proportional to distance) the cost of urban living (rent plus commuting cost) \nincreases with the square of population.  More generally, the cost is increasing and \nconvex. \nThe standard empirical model of the housing market consists of a demand \nequation that determines house prices in the short run as a function of the housing stock, \npopulation, income per household, interest rates etc; a supply equation that determines \nthe supply of new housing; and an adjustment equation determining how the stock of \nhouses adjusts over time as new houses are completed.  Within this framework, the long \nrun impact of population change on house prices depends on the price elasticities of \nhousing demand and supply13. A recent review of evidence for the UK suggests that the \nprice elasticity of demand for housing is of the order of  -0.5.  If the supply of housing is \nprice inelastic then the elasticity of house prices with respect to the number of \nhouseholds is estimated to be between 1.7 and 2.5 (MEEN and ANDREWS, 1998; \nMEEN, 2003).  The larger is the supply elasticity the less responsive are house prices to \n 29 \npopulation changes in the long run (i.e. the steeper is the HH curve). For example, \nincreasing the supply elasticity to 1 reduces the elasticity of house prices with respect to \npopulation changes to less than 1.  However, given that new housing construction is \nsmall in relation to the existing housing stock, prices may be very slow in achieving \ntheir long run equilibrium values. Evidence from model simulation suggests that with a \nsupply elasticity of around 1, house prices would remain significantly above their long \nrun equilibrium value some 40 years after an initial increase in population (MEEN and \nANDREWS, 1998). \nRecent estimates of the price elasticity of housing supply vary widely across \ncountries.  For the UK, BARKER, 2004 reports a range of estimates for the price \nelasticity of supply of new housing from about 0.3 to 1.0; with evidence of substantial \nvariation in supply elasticities across regions (see e.g. MEEN, 2003).  SWANK et al, \n2002 provide international comparisons of the price elasticity across countries, ranging \nfrom lows of 0.3 for the Netherlands and 0.5 for the UK to highs of 1.4 for the US and \n2.1 for Germany.  The constraints imposed by the planning system play a major role in \ndetermining supply elasticity. For example, the land use planning system in the UK \ndetermines the supply of land essentially independently of price. Since a central \nintention of this planning is to contain urban development by fixing growth boundaries, \nthe supply of space is quasi-fixed. While it is possible to increase the density of \noccupation of a given land area, evidence suggest that this margin of flexibility has not \nbeen sufficient to prevent the elasticity of supply of housing from decreasing in the UK \nbetween the early and later parts of the 20th century as supply constraints became \nbinding (MALPEZZI and MACLENNAN, 2001). A number of studies of US regional \nhousing markets have identified low supply elasticity of housing due to land use \nregulations as an important factor behind rapid housing price increases in a number of \n 30 \nUS metropolitan areas, most notably San Francisco, Boston and Los Angeles \n(EVENSON 2002; GLAESER and GYOURKO, 2003; GLAESER et al., 2005).  \nGYOURKO at al, 2006 point to the role of heterogeneity in locations\u2019 endowment of \namenities, and the likelihood that supply elasticities might be particularly low in \ndesirable locations.  Combining this with widening income inequality creates rising \nhouse prices in desirable \u2018superstar cities\u2019.  \nFinally, what of the possibility that house prices and hence the cost of living are \ndirectly affected by changes in wages? The consensus in the empirical literature is that \nthe long run effect on house prices of changes in income per household (i.e. wages) is at \nleast as great as that of changes in the number of households (REF). However, as \ndemonstrated in section 4, with a positive earnings-employment relationship, \nproductivity shocks give rise to positively correlated movements in house prices and \nwages, even in the absence of any direct causal link between wages and house prices. \nThe possible joint endogeneity of house prices and household incomes and the \nimplications for estimation of the income elasticity of demand for housing are issues \nwhich have been hitherto ignored in the literature.  This discussion serves to highlight, \nonce again, that the reduced form relationships are helpful for simplifying and thinking \nthrough the nature of linkages but that further progress will require a more detailed \nunderstanding of the exact nature of the underlying processes. \n \n6.2  Migration and the MM relationship: \nThe third key ingredient is migration.  How mobile is labour between regions?  \nAnswering this question is difficult, because it is quite possible that very high degrees \nof potential mobility coexist with low levels of actual mobility, precisely because \n 31 \nhousing prices are acting to equilibrate flows, making households indifferent between \nliving in different regions. \nOn average 1 percent of households migrate between major regions of the UK \neach year, with net outflows from London, the North East, North West and West \nMidlands and net inflows into the South East, South West and East (HM TREASURY, \n2001).  The empirical evidence for the UK supports the contention that workers\u2019 \nlocation decisions are responsive to real wage differentials.  A body of econometric \nevidence has built up showing that high relative wages significantly increase net \nmigration into a region; while high relative house prices discourage it (see MURPHY, \net al, 2006 for a recent review).  There is also evidence of a migration\/commuting trade-\noff (JACKMAN and SAVOURI, 1996; Murphy et al, 2006).  For contiguous regions, \nwhere relatively cheap commuting offers an alternative to migration, the location \ndecision tends to be more strongly influenced by housing price differentials and less \ninfluenced by wage differentials.  The reverse is true if commuting is more costly.  This \nsuggests that migration in the UK will move the economy along the ZZ curve towards \nthe intersection with the MM curve where real incomes are equalised.   \nOne important caveat is in order, however. Within these average mobility rates \nthere are large variations in migration rates between skill groups, with higher skill \ngroups displaying a significantly higher propensity to move between locations than their \nlower skilled counterparts. A number of possible explanations have been offered for this \ndifference. The costs of migration \u2013 particularly those associated with transacting in the \nhousing market \u2013 may be relatively greater for lower skilled workers (HUGHES and \nMCCORMICK, 2000).  Lower skilled workers tend to rely more heavily on local \ninformal networks of contacts for information regarding the job market.  Finally, the \nexternal benefits associated with \u2018thick\u2019 labour markets produce clustering of high \n 32 \nskilled jobs. Workers sort by location whereby more able workers group themselves in \nparticular locations where there are the largest economic returns. In particular contexts, \nwe may want to allow for these differences in mobility across different groups. \n \n7.   Conclusion \n \nWe have argued that three relationships play a key role in determining the economic \nlinkages between cities.  The first concerns the link between local employment and \nearnings, the second the link between local employment and the cost of living and the \nthird the migration response to differences in real wages between locations.  These three \nrelationships provide the basis for a diagrammatic framework for analysing the linkages \nbetween cities or regions. We can use this framework to draw out the implications of \nexisting theoretical models for the linkages between cities, even though these models \nare not explicitly concerned with these linkages. Perhaps more importantly for policy \npurposes, this diagrammatic framework allows us to consider when gains in one city or \nregion spillover positively or negatively to other areas.   \nThe simple reduced framework set out in sections 3 and 4 highlights the \nimportance of the nature of the relationship between employment and earnings in \ndetermining the direction of spillovers between cities\/regions.  If the relationship \nbetween employment and earnings is negative then complementarity applies, so that a \npositive productivity shock to one city creates positive spillovers to other cities as \neconomic adjustment dampens and disperses the impact of shocks.  This outcome is \nreversed if the relationship between employment and earnings is positive as a result of \nagglomeration economies.  In these circumstances cities or regions are in a competitive \nrelationship, and the process of adjustment to shocks tends to amplify the gains to one \n 33 \narea.  If workers are perfectly mobile then migration flows ensure that these changes in \nnominal earnings do not translate in to differences in real earnings (because the cost of \nliving adjusts to offset the earnings differential).  If this is not the case, workers in the \nother cities can see their real standard of living decline. \nGiven their importance, what do we know about the nature of the three key \nrelationships?  A priori theoretical reasoning cannot help us choose between the \ndifferent possibilities and we must turn instead to empirical evidence. We have \nreviewed the evidence on all three relationships, with a particular focus on the earnings-\nemployment relationship where, arguably, our degree of ignorance is greatest.  We \nreach a number of conclusions.  First, the nature of the housing market in the UK means \nthat the cost of living increases quickly with rising employment.  Second, and consistent \nwith our theoretical framework, this cost of living effect implies small migration flows \nbetween cities, even though the evidence suggests that many workers are quite mobile \nand respond to real earnings differentials between places.  It is likely that commuting \nbetween cities partially substitutes for the migration that would occur in the absence of \ncost of living effects.  Third, the employment-earnings relationship may be upward \nsloping meaning that population movement between cities or regions tends to widen \nearnings differentials, but this relationship is almost certainly sector and location \nspecific.   \nThis specificity makes it hard to reach general conclusions about magnitudes, \nbut does allow us to generalise about the direction of changes induced by the linkages \nbetween regions.  Specifically, the positive employment relationship, at least for some \nranges of city sizes points to the possibility of a competing relationship.  As we have \nseen this means that an initial positive shock to, say, productivity in one region will get \nmagnified as workers migrate from other regions.  However, as workers migrate, living \n 34 \ncosts are driven up.  Where housing supply is relatively inelastic, as in the UK, this may \nbe associated with quite small movements in population.   \nDo the resulting changes in employment, wages and cost of living matter?  For \nmobile workers the answer is almost certainly not. Willingness to migrate ensures that \nreal wages are equalized independent of location choice. In the UK, at least, this \nsuggests that differences in wages and house prices are not a major issue for young \nskilled graduates who are highly mobile.  For lower skilled workers and others who, for \none reason or another, may be immobile, the effects are more complicated.  In the \nexpanding region, these workers may see increases in housing costs outweighing \nincreases in wages if agglomeration effects are larger for skilled than unskilled (which \nempirically may be the case).  In contracting regions the opposite effect may occur.  \nThese differences will also play out differently depending on the pattern of home \nownership with implications for wealth as house prices change.  Clearly, further work is \nneeded, but our theoretical model, coupled with the limited empirical evidence at least \nprovides a starting point for thinking about these issues. \n \n 35 \nAppendix \nThere are K regions, and region i has labour forces Li, with \u03a3iLi  = L.

Some of this dependence may come via \nwages, so the h(.) function can be decomposed (using the iso-elastic case) to \n( ) ( ) wwh iiiii LabLh \u03b5\u03b7\u03b5\/= , where w\u03b5  is the elasticity of the cost of living with respect to \nthe wage rate, h\u03b5  is the elasticity of the cost of living with respect to labour force \n(conditional on the wage rate), and h\u03b7  is the sum of the partial effects, wwhh \u03b5\u03b7\u03b5\u03b7 += . \nThis generalization makes no difference to the figures or qualitative analysis, but \ncomparative statics are now based on equation A4\u2019 with A5, where   \n  hwwhwhwwhw jjjjiiii LbacLbac\n\u03b5\u03b5\u03b7\u03b5\u03b5\u03b5\u03b5\u03b7\u03b5\u03b5 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212 = )1(1)1(1 .      (A4\u2019) \nThe implications of a direct effect of wages on the cost of living, w\u03b5  > 0, for the \nanalysis of sections 3 and 4 depends on the sign of w\u03b7 .  If w\u03b7 <  0 (the complementary \ncase) then w\u03b5  > 0 makes h\u03b7  smaller and the HH curve steeper.  As noted in (4.1) a \nsteeper HH curve means that a shock leads to relatively large movements in population \nand small changes in costs of living and wages. With w\u03b7 > 0 (the competing case), w\u03b5  > \n 38 \n0 increases the sum of the partial effects, h\u03b7 .  The HH curve depicted in figures 1-6 \ntends to be flatter, and small movements in population lead to relatively large changes \nin living costs of living. Notice that the dividing line between competing and \ncomplementary cases, that is where w\u03b7 = 0, is unaffected by allowing an effect through \nw\u03b5  > 0.  However, the value of w\u03b5  does matter for the emergence of a divergent regime. \nDivergence requires that w h h w w\u03b7 \u03b7 \u03b5 \u03b7 \u03b5> = +  , which is not possible if w\u03b5  \u2265 1. \n 39 \nReferences \nABDEL-RAHMAN H.M. and ANAS A.

Some sources \nof endogenous variation can be captured in our reduced form relationships (for example, \nparticipation depends on the wage which in turn depends on \u03bb) but for clarity we leave \nthese forces in the background.  \n2  If the production function is Cobb-Douglas and other factors are fixed then w\u03b7  + 1 is \nequal to the elasticity of output with respect to labour. \n3  With non-constant returns to scale it is also possible that the shape of these functions \ndepends on total population. \n4   Comparative static analysis of a change in productivity parameters would then shift \nthis relationship, an effect that we ignore in section 4 but discuss in the appendix. \n5 An additional complication, which could be more easily incorporated, arises from the \npresence of a fixed cost of moving. In this case,  the migration equilibrium schedule \nwould be characterised by a band with the upper curve of that band identifying real \nwage differences that are sufficiently high to overcome the fixed cost of moving and \nlead to migration from north to south (and vice versa for the lower band).  All points \nwithin this band would then represent possible long run equilibria but with the \nremaining analysis essentially unchanged. \n6  This requires that the elasticity of the HH curve varies. This would happen if, for \nexample, congestion rises faster with population for small cities (perhaps because it is \ninefficient to offer public transport) and large cities than for medium size cities. Varying \nelasticity on the EE curve could also achieve this if there were diminishing returns over \nsome range of city sizes and increasing returns over others.  \n7  This assumes that the productivity shock does not have any direct effect on the cost of \nliving. This assumption is relaxed in the appendix. \n 1 \n                                                                                                                                               \n8  Factor prices are invariant with respect to a region\u2019s endowment, see Leamer and \nLevinsohn (1995) \n9   The fundamental market failure in the model is increasing returns at the level of the \nfirm, meaning that firms do not divide their production between all regions. \n10   This direct interaction is in addition to the equilibrium interactions of our model. \n11 Au and Henderson (2004) provide evidence that productivity effects in China follow \nan inverted-U so that productivity (and hence wages) are only increasing over some \nrange of city sizes. \n12   The first attempt to combine Krugman\u2019s model with increasing land prices was \nHelpman (1998). \n13  The elasticity of house prices with respect to population is given by \n\/( )d d sL\u03b5 \u03b5 \u03b5+ where \nd\nL\u03b5  is the elasticity of demand for housing with respect to \npopulation ; d\u03b5  is the price elasticity of demand for housing and s\u03b5  is the price \nelasticity of supply of housing. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"}
