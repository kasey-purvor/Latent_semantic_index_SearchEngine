INTRODUCTION\nIn recent years there has been a great deal of progress\nin using semiclassical methods to describe the quantum\nbehaviour of systems which are classically chaotic. Semi-\nclassics was applied to analyzing the transport properties\nof chaotic quantum dots in Refs. [1, 2]. Despite clear in-\ndications from the quasiclassical method [3, 4, 5, 6], it\ntook many years to understand how to go beyond the di-\nagonal approximation [7, 8, 9], and thereby use semiclas-\nsics to analyze mesoscopic effects such as weak localiza-\ntion [10, 11, 12, 13], universal conductance fluctuations\n[14, 15] and shot-noise [16, 17, 18]. Before these works,\ngeneral statements on the quantum behaviour of such\nsystems relied on the Bohigas-Giannoni-Schmit conjec-\nture [19] that they are well-described by random-matrix\ntheory (RMT) [20, 21]. RMT is a statistical theory based\non the assumption that we know nothing about the dy-\nnamics of the system (besides global symmetries such as\ntime-reversal and spin-rotation symmetry). However, of-\nten this is not the case; perhaps the system has extra\nconstants of motion or the classical phase space of the\nsystem is mixed (so that some parts are regular and oth-\ners are chaotic). Such systems are hard to treat using\nRMT methods. In those cases where progress with RMT\nis possible, one adds more phenomenological parameters\nto the theory, thereby reducing its predictive power. One\nof the great hopes for semiclassics is that it will pro-\nvide microscopic theories for such situations, in which all\nparameters can be derived from properties of the confin-\ning potential (and any inter-particle interactions that are\npresent).\nA simpler, but related, problem is that of chaotic sys-\ntems with additional spatial symmetries (reflection or in-\nversion symmetries). One can ask two questions. Do\nspatial symmetries lead to interference effects similar\nto those induced by time-reversal symmetry (coherent\nbackscattering and weak localization effects)? If so, how\nare these interference effects changed by the presence of\nspatial asymmetries or magnetic fields?\nThese discrete spatial symmetries are simple enough to\nbe amenable to a phenomenological analysis with RMT.\nSuch an analysis was carried out in Refs. [22, 23] where\nit was shown that spatial symmetries do indeed lead to\nextra interference effects analogous to weak localization.\nSince that work, there have been a number of other stud-\nies of chaotic systems with symmetries. Refs. [24, 25, 26]\nuse RMT methods to study the distribution of transmis-\nsion eigenvalues, while Ref. [27] identifies a huge inter-\nference effect in double-dots separated by a tunnel bar-\nrier. However, none of these works have addressed how\nthe weak localization correction and conductance fluctu-\nations behave for dots that are only approximately sym-\nmetric.\nThis is the first of a pair of articles in which we per-\nform a semiclassical analysis of symmetry-induced inter-\nference effects on quantum transport, and in particular\ntheir contributions to weak localization corrections and\nconductance fluctuations. We consider a quantum dot\n(billiard) whose shape has spatial symmetries (mirror or\ninversion symmetries) but is otherwise shaped such that\nthe classical dynamics within it would exhibit hyperbolic\nchaos (exponential divergence of initially close trajecto-\nries). We develop a semiclassical theory of transport be-\ntween two ideal leads coupled to the dot, building on the\ntheory for similar chaotic systems without spatial sym-\n2Average conductance UCFs\nB \u226a Bc B \u226b Bc B \u226a Bc B \u226b Bc\nno spatial sym.

Bc is a magnetic field strength at which time-reversal\nsymmetry is broken in the asymmetric situation. These re-\nsults are taken from Refs. [22, 23], where they were derived\nin RMT. Here we rederive these results semiclassically, and\nshow how they depend on asymmetries in the dot, dephasing,\nmagnetic fields and Ehrenfest times.\nmetries. First, we give a non-phenomenological explana-\ntion of the origin of the symmetry-induced interference\neffects found in RMT [22, 23]. We then investigate how\ntransport is affected by asymmetries in the dot, magnetic\nfields, dephasing, and the Ehrenfest time (which char-\nacterizes the emergence of fully developed wave chaos\n[5, 28]). For this we make use of analogies with the anal-\nysis of dephasing in asymmetric dots [29, 30, 31].\nWe find that different types of deformations away from\nsymmetry destroy the symmetry-induced interference ef-\nfects in remarkably different ways. The deformations we\nconsider have the same universal dependence on an asym-\nmetry parameter \u03b3asym; however, the microscopic form\nof this parameter varies depending on the type of defor-\nmation. For a global deformation of the dot (say half\nthe dot is displaced outward), we find that a displace-\nment \u03b4L of less than a Fermi wavelength is sufficient to\ncompletely destroy the symmetry-induced interference ef-\nfects. In contrast, for the deformation of a small part of\nthe boundary (say a portion less than but of order a lead-\nwidth is displaced outwards) we find that an arbitrary\nlarge displacement \u03b4L does not destroy the symmetry-\ninduced interference effects completely, instead it simply\nsuppresses them by a finite amount.\nFinally, we address how asymmetries and magnetic\nfields can be incorporated into a simple phenomenological\nRMT model, and compare results of numerical computa-\ntions in this model with the semiclassical predictions.\nIn the second of this pair of articles [32], we use the\nsame methods to find these transport properties for a\nspatially symmetric system coupled to leads which do\nnot respect the symmetry.\nII. SCOPE AND OVERVIEW OF THIS WORK\nIn this article we consider two-dimensional chaotic\nquantum dots of characteristic size L, perfectly coupled\nto two leads, labeled the left (L) and right (R) lead.\nThe leads have widths WL and WR much greater than\nthe Fermi wavelength \u03bbF = h\/pF. Thus the leads carry\nNL and NR modes, where N\u03ba = pFW\u03ba\/(\u03c0~) \u226b 1 for\n\u03ba \u2208 L,R.\nAssuming that ergodicity of the classical dynamics is\nestablished quickly, there are only a few time scales which\nfully characterize the quantum transport through the\ndot. The typical time that a particle spends in the dot is\ngiven by the dwell time \u03c4D = \u03c40 \u00d7 C\/(WL +WR), where\nC is the dot\u2019s circumference and \u03c40 = \u03c0A\/CvF is the\nscattering time off the boundary (here A is the area of\nthe dot and vF is the Fermi velocity).\nIt is now clear that the development of quantum inter-\nference effects in such systems is governed by Ehrenfest\ntimes \u03c4E [5]. Semiclassics enables us to treat finite Ehren-\nfest times, thereby exploring the crossover between RMT\nbehaviour (\u03c4E \u226a \u03c4D) and classical behaviour (\u03c4E \u226b \u03c4D).\nThere is in fact a set of Ehrenfest times, which all take\nthe form [28]\n\u03c4E = \u039b\n\u22121 ln[(L\/\u03bbF)L] (1)\nwhere \u039b is the Lyapunov exponent of the classical dy-\nnamics in the dot, and L is the ratio of characteristic\nclassical length scales. Of relevance for this paper are\nthe open-system Ehrenfest time \u03c4oE, given by Eq. (1) with\nL = (W\/L)2 [33], and the closed-system Ehrenfest time\n\u03c4cE with L = 1 (a third Ehrenfest time \u03c4\nd\nE with L =W\/L\nis relevant for decay problems [34]).\nTwo other relevant time scales are the dephasing time\n\u03c4\u03c6 = 1\/\u03b3\u03c6 (where \u03b3\u03c6 is the dephasing rate), and the time\nscale \u03c4B \u223c (B0\/B)2\u03c40 on which a magnetic field destroys\ntime-reversal symmetry in the internal dynamics. Here,\nB0 \u223c h\/(eA) is a characteristic field strength at which\nabout one flux quantum penetrates the quantum dot. For\ntransport, the effect of a magnetic field is significant when\nit is of order\nBc = aB0\n\u221a\n\u03c40\/2\u03c4D, (2)\nwhere a is a system-specific parameter of order one [21].\nThere are three spatial symmetries of particular inter-\nest for transport through a chaotic quantum dot coupled\nto two leads. The first two map the L lead onto the R\nlead and vice versa, they are a left-right mirror symme-\ntry (Fig. 2) and an inversion symmetry (Fig. 4). The\nthird type of symmetry maps each lead onto itself, such\nas an up-down mirror symmetry (Fig. 5). A dot with any\ntwo of the three symmetries listed above is four-fold sym-\nmetric, and automatically satisfies the third symmetry.\nFour-fold symmetry is most easily visualized by consider-\ning a dot which has both left-right and up-down mirror\nsymmetry. For dots with two leads there are no addi-\ntional cases of multiple symmetry.\n3Readers already familiar with the semiclassical the-\nory of weak localization [10] and coherent backscattering\n[12, 13] may only need to look at Figs. 2-5 to understand\nthe extra symmetry-induced interference effects. Once\none folds the paths shown under the relevant symmetry\n(the right-hand sketches in each figure), we obtain con-\ntributions which are similar to the weak localization and\ncoherent backscattering contributions in a system with\nno spatial symmetries. Indeed, given these figures, many\nsuch readers will probably be able to correctly guess the\nform of the results for perfect symmetry, which agree\nwith the results of RMT tabulated in Table I. Treating\nasymmetries, however, is more involved.\nThe rest of this article is laid out as follows. In Sec-\ntion III we review the semiclassical description of quan-\ntum transport, and discuss how it should be modified to\ninclude spatial symmetries. In Section IV we treat weak\nlocalization in dots with left-right symmetry and discuss\nthe role of perpendicular magnetic fields, dephasing, and\nasymmetry in the dot. In Sections V, VI and VII we an-\nalyze weak localization in dots with inversion symmetry,\nup-down symmetry and four-fold symmetry, respectively.\nIn Section VIII we provide a semiclassical descrip-\ntion of conductance fluctuations in symmetric systems\nand discuss the effects of asymmetries and perpendicular\nmagnetic fields. To keep the discussion simple we do not\naddress dephasing here (unlike for weak localization).\nIn Section IX we propose an efficient phenomenological\nmodel to study symmetry breaking in RMT and compare\nthe results of numerical computations to the semiclassical\npredictions.\nFinally in Section X, we consider the application of our\nresults to experimental systems. We estimate the neces-\nsary conditions for observing these symmetry-induced ef-\nfects in the transport of electrons through quantum dots,\nand of microwaves through chaotic cavities.\nIII. THE THEORY OF SEMICLASSICAL\nTRANSPORT\nThe semiclassical picture of weak localization in disor-\ndered systems has been known for many years for both\ns-wave disorder [3, 4] and smooth disorder [5]. However,\nonly recently has it been possible to extend this picture to\ndisorder-free but chaotic systems, such as ballistic quan-\ntum dots [10]. We start with the semiclassical theory of\ntransport [1, 2] and sum over lead modes as in Ref. [12]\n(see also Appendix B in Ref. [35]). Then the dimension-\nless conductance (conductance in units of 2e2\/h) is given\nby\ng =\n1\n2\u03c0~\n\u222b\nL\ndy0\n\u222b\nR\ndy\n\u2211\n\u03b3,\u03b3\u2032\nA\u03b3A\u03b3\u2032 e\ni(S\u03b3\u2212S\u03b3\u2032 )\/~, (3)\nwhere the double sum is over all classical paths \u03b3, \u03b3\u2032,\nfrom point y0 on lead L to point y on lead R. Path \u03b3\nhas a classical action S\u03b3 =\n\u222b\n\u03b3\npdr, and an amplitude\nA\u03b3 . Refs. [1, 2] have shown that the squared-amplitude\nA2\u03b3 = (dpy0\/dy), so it measures the path\u2019s stability (the\nchange in the path\u2019s initial momentum py0 associated\nwith a small displacement of its final position y).\nFor most pairs of \u03b3 and \u03b3\u2032 the exponential in Eq. (3)\noscillates wildly as one changes the energy or the dot-\nshape. Thus they make no contribution to the average\nconductance (where one averages over energy, dot-shape,\nor both). The only contributions that survive averaging\nare those where the pairs of paths have highly correlated\nactions; typically one has S\u03b3 \u2243 S\u03b3\u2032 for a broad range of\nenergies and dot-shapes. The simplest example of this are\nall contributions to the double-sum with \u03b3\u2032 = \u03b3. These\n\u201cdiagonal contributions\u201d to the above double sum can be\nevaluated with the help of the sum rule (in the spirit of\nEq. (B6) of Ref. [1])\n\u2211\n\u03b3\nA2\u03b3 [\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ]\u03b3 =\n\u222b pi\n2\n\u2212pi\n2\nd\u03b80\n\u222b pi\n2\n\u2212pi\n2\nd\u03b8 pF cos \u03b80\n\u00d7P\u02dc (Y,Y0; t) [\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ]Y0 , (4)\nwhere we define P\u02dc (Y,Y0; t)\u03b4y\u03b4\u03b8\u03b4t as the classical prob-\nability for a particle to go from an initial position and\nmomentum angle of Y0 \u2261 (y0, \u03b80) on lead L to within\n(\u03b4y, \u03b4\u03b8) of Y = (y, \u03b8) on lead R in a time within \u03b4t\nof t. For any given dot at a given energy, P\u02dc (Y,Y0; t)\nhas a Dirac \u03b4-function on each classical path. However,\nthe average of P\u02dc over an ensemble of dots or over en-\nergy gives a smooth function. We assume the classi-\ncal dynamics exhibit hyperbolic chaos, thus they will\nbe mixing. If the dynamics are mixing on a timescale\n\u226a \u03c4D, this function will rapidly decay to a uniform\ndistribution over phase space, so that we can assume\u2329\nP\u02dc (Y;Y0; t)\n\u232a\n= e\u2212t\/\u03c4D cos \u03b8\/(2 (WL +WR) \u03c4D). The\nsum of these diagonal contributions gives the Drude con-\nductance (also called the classical conductance)\n\u3008g\u3009D = NLNR\n(NL +NR)\n. (5)\nA. Weak localization\nSystems that exhibit time-reversal symmetry (typi-\ncally systems in zero magnetic field) have correlations\nbetween paths that are the time-reverse of each other.\nIf path \u03b3\u2032 is the time-reverse of path \u03b3 then S\u03b3 = S\u03b3\u2032\nfor all energies and dot-shapes, and as such one could\nexpect contributions to the average conductance coming\nfrom these pairs of paths. However, looking at Eq. 3,\nwe see that paths that are the exact time-reverse of each\nother contribute to reflection but not transmission, and\nfurther require that y = y0 which reduces their contribu-\ntion to reflection to zero. In contrast, paths that are the\napproximate time-reverse of each other, or have segments\nthat are the approximate time-reverse of each other, give\na finite contribution to both reflection and transmission.\n4R leadL lead\nFigure 1: (colour online). Sketch of a planar quantum dot with a left-right mirror symmetry. On the left we show a classical\npath (solid line) and its mirror image (dashed line). Each path is piecewise straight and undergoes specular reflections at\nthe boundary of the dot. The path is chaotic (we assume hyperbolic chaos), so its position and momentum after time t are\nexponentially sensitive to the initial position and momentum. We assume the system is such that a typical path crosses the\nsymmetry axis a large number of times before escaping into a lead (these crossings occur on a timescale of order of the time-\nof-flight across the system). To simplify the sketches elsewhere in this article we draw paths as abstract curves (shown on the\nright) which only show those crossings of the symmetry axis which are crucial to the nature of the path.\nThey are the weak localization and coherent backscatter-\ning contributions discussed in Ref. [10], with the latter\nbeing more carefully analyzed in Refs. [12, 13]. Such con-\ntributions all involve a path \u03b3 having a loop such that\nthere is an encounter where the path comes very close to\nitself while also having the opposite momentum (result-\ning in two almost-parallel segments which are traversed\nin opposite direction). Path \u03b3\u2032 closely follows \u03b3, but tra-\nverses the loop in opposite direction, which results in a\ncrossing at the encounter. For classical dynamics which\nexhibit hyperbolic chaos, |S\u03b3 \u2212 S\u03b3\u2032 | < ~ for all energies\nand dot-shapes if at the encounter the two parallel seg-\nments of path \u03b3 are separated by a distance less than\n(\u03bbFL)\n1\/2. Thus such contributions survive averaging,\nand summing them gives the weak localization correc-\ntion to the average conductance,\n\u3008\u03b4g\u3009wl = \u2212 NLNR\n(NL +NR)2\nexp[\u2212\u03c4cE\/\u03c4D]\u00d7 Z(B, \u03b3\u03c6). (6)\nThe RMT regime is defined by \u03c4cE \u226a \u03c4D so that the fac-\ntor exp[\u2212\u03c4cE\/\u03c4D] equates to unity. In the classical regime\n(\u03c4cE > \u03c4D), on the other hand, the weak localization cor-\nrection is exponentially suppressed [5]. The factor\nZ(B, \u03b3\u03c6) =\nexp[\u2212\u03b3\u03c6\u03c4\u02dc ]\n1 + (B\/Bc)2 + \u03b3\u03c6\u03c4D\n(7)\ndescribes the suppression due to a magnetic field and\nfinite dephasing. The magnetic-field induced suppres-\nsion occurs with the crossover from dynamics with time-\nreversal symmetry to dynamics without time-reversal\nsymmetry. The crossover scale Bc is given in Eq. (2).\nThe time scale \u03c4\u02dc depends on the origin of the dephas-\ning [29, 30, 31]. For electron-electron interactions \u03c4\u02dc in the\ndot [29] or dephasing leads [30] it is of order the Ehren-\nfest time, while for dephasing due to microwave noise or\ncharge-fluctuations on gates near the dot it is given by\nthe logarithm of the ratio of the noise correlation length,\n\u03be, to the dot size. See Ref. [31] for an extensive discussion\nof the nature of \u03be and \u03c4\u02dc for all these sources of noise.\nB. Universal conductance fluctuations (UCFs)\nThe conductance of an individual quantum dot has\na characteristic dependence on energy, applied magnetic\nfield, and deformations of the dot\u2019s shape (which can be\ncontrolled by the voltages applied to the side- or top gates\nproviding the electrostatic confinement). The magnitude\nof these fluctuations can be characterized by the variance\nof the conductance, which \u201cuniversally\u201d has a magnitude\nof order (e2\/h)2 (meaning the variance of the dimension-\nless conductance is of order 1). In the absence of dephas-\ning, semiclassics predicts UCFs in a chaotic quantum dot\nwith no spatial symmetries given by [14, 15]\nvar(g) =\nN2LN\n2\nR\n(NL +NR)4\n\u00d7 Zucf(B), (8)\nwhere\nZucf(B) = 1 +\ne\u2212\u03c4\no\nE\/\u03c4D\n[1 + (B\/Bc)2]2\n+\n1\u2212 e\u2212\u03c4oE\/\u03c4D\n1 + (B\/Bc)2\n(9)\ndescribes the effect a perpendicular magnetic field B.\nThus for B \u226a Bc or B \u226b Bc the magnitude of the UCFs\nis independent of the Ehrenfest time \u03c4oE. However, the\nform of the crossover between the two limiting cases de-\npends on the Ehrenfest time; the crossover is Lorentzian\nin the classical limit (\u03c4oE \u226b \u03c4D) and Lorentzian-squared\nin the RMT limit (\u03c4oE \u226a \u03c4D). The effect of dephasing on\nUCFs is more complicated [29] and will not be considered\nhere.\nC. Adding spatial symmetries to the semiclassical\nmethod\nWe start our discussion of spatial symmetries by ex-\nplaining the sketches in Figs. 2-5. The relationship be-\ntween the depicted paths and real classical paths in a\nchaotic dot is illustrated in Fig. 1. The abstract sketches\nin Figs. 2-5 neglect all details of the paths except the\nfollowing essential ones:\n5\u2022 We show that a path crosses the symmetry axis\nonly when it is necessary to understand the nature\nof the path. For example the paths in Fig. 2(a)\ngoing from lead L to lead R are shown to cross the\nsymmetry axis once, when they may in fact cross\nthe symmetry axis any (odd) number of times. In-\ndeed a typical path will cross the symmetry axis ev-\nery few bounces, and will bounce very many times\nbefore escaping into a lead.\n\u2022 We show when a path comes extremely close in\nphase space to its symmetric partners (related to it\nby spatial symmetry). These effective encounters\nplay a similar role to those discussed above for weak\nlocalization.\nIn the figures, the right-hand sketches show all paths\nfolded (via the symmetry) into half the system, which\nemphasizes when a path comes close to its spatially sym-\nmetric partner (i.e., its mirror image in systems with a\nmirror symmetry). As is the case with time-reversal sym-\nmetry, pairs of paths that are exactly symmetric have\na negligible contribution to the conductance. However,\npairs of approximately symmetric paths [such as shown in\nFig. 2(a)] sum to give a finite contribution. This is also\nthe case for pairs of paths which have some segments\nwhich are approximately the same and other segments\nwhich are approximately symmetric to each other [such\nas shown in Fig. 2(b)].\nIV. LEFT-RIGHT MIRROR SYMMETRY\nFirst we analyze the case of a perfectly left-right sym-\nmetric dot with symmetric leads, WL = WR and there-\nfore NL = NR \u2261 N . There are three interference con-\ntributions to transmission and reflection that exist only\nbecause of the symmetry. Two of these contribute to\ntransmission [Fig. 2(a),(b)], while the third contributes\nto reflection [Fig. 2(c)].\nA. Enhanced forward scattering\nThe contribution of paths of the type in Fig. 2(a) have\nan effective encounter which is close to the leads. This is\nanalogous to the coherent-backscattering contribution in\nRef. [12] (or the D2, D3-contributions to the shot noise in\nRef. [17]) and we therefore use the same method to treat\nsuch paths here. First we note that the behaviour of path\n\u03b3\u2032 is completely determined by that of path \u03b3; the two\npaths have the same amplitudes, A\u03b3\u2032 = A\u03b3 and the action\ndifference between them is S\u03b3\u2212S\u03b3\u2032 = (p0\u22a5+m\u039br0\u22a5)r0\u22a5,\nwhere (r0\u22a5, p0\u22a5) is the component of Y \u2212 Y0 which is\nperpendicular to the direction of path \u03b3 at Y. This ac-\ntion difference requires hyperbolic chaos and is discussed\nin detail in the context of coherent backscattering in\nRef. [12]. Using the sum rule in Eq. (4), we see that\neffective \nencounter\nnear lead\neffective\nencounter\nin dot\n(b) Reduction of transmission due to left\u2212right symmetry \n(c) Reduction of reflection due to left\u2212right symmetry \n(a) Enhancement of transmission due to left\u2212right symmetry \nL\nL\nW\neffective\nencounter\nin dot\n\u2019\u03b3\n\u2019\u03b3\n\u2019\u03b3\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\nFigure 2: (colour online). Contributions to weak localization\ndue to a left-right mirror symmetry. When we fold the paths\ninto one half of the dot (as shown in the right-hand sketches),\npaths hitting the symmetry axis are specularly reflected; how-\never, we must keep track of whether the path escapes into the\nright lead. Thus in those sketches, paths that end on the left\nlead are marked with solid circles, while those that end on the\nright lead are marked with open (red) circles. The sketch in\n(a) is an enhanced forward-scattering contribution, because\nit enhances transmission through the dot.\nthe contribution of such paths to the conductance is\n\u3008\u03b4g\u3009LR:a = (2\u03c0~)\u22122\n\u222b\nL\ndY0\n\u222b\nR\ndY\n\u222b \u221e\n0\ndt (10)\n\u00d7pF cos \u03b80 \u3008P\u02dc (Y,Y0; t)\u3009 Re\n[\nei(S\u03b3\u2212S\u03b3\u2032)\/~\n]\n.\nTo perform the average we proceed as for coherent\nbackscattering [12]. Starting at the leads, we define\nT \u2032W (r0\u22a5, p0\u22a5) and T\n\u2032\nL(r0\u22a5, p0\u22a5) as the time at which the\nperpendicular distance between \u03b3 and \u03b3\u2032 reaches W and\nL, respectively. For times less than T \u2032W (r0\u22a5, p0\u22a5), the\npath segments are paired, and thus their joint survival\nprobability is the same as for a single path (if one path\ndoes not touch a lead then the other also does not). For\ntimes longer than this the path segments escape inde-\npendently. We only have contributions if paths \u03b3 and\n\u03b3\u2032 diverge from each other in phase space before recon-\nverging at the R lead. For the reconvergence to occur\nthe paths must diverge to a distance of order L (on\nshorter scales the dynamics are hyperbolic so the recon-\nvergence of diverging paths is not allowed). This means\n6that the t-integral in Eq. (10) must have a lower cut-off\nat 2T \u2032L(r0\u22a5, p0\u22a5).\nNow we write the Y0 integral in Eq. (10) in terms of\nthe relative coordinates (r0\u22a5, p0\u22a5), using pF cos \u03b80dY0 =\ndy0d(pF sin \u03b80) = dr0\u22a5dp0\u22a5. Then the Y integral be-\ncomes explicitly independent of (r0\u22a5, p0\u22a5) and we can\nwrite \u222b\nR\ndY\n\u222b \u221e\n2T \u2032\nL\ndt\u3008P\u02dc (Y,Y0; t)\u3009\n=\n1\n2\nexp[\u2212T \u2032W \/\u03c4D \u2212 2(T \u2032L \u2212 T \u2032W )\/\u03c4D], (11)\nwhere T \u2032L,W are shorthand for T\n\u2032\nL,W (r0\u22a5, p0\u22a5) and we\nused the fact that NL = NR to get the prefactor of a half\n(more generally the prefactor would be NR\/(NL+NR)).\nFor small (p0\u22a5 +m\u039br0\u22a5) we get\nT \u2032L(r0\u22a5, p0\u22a5) \u2243 \u039b\u22121 ln\n[\nm\u039bL\n|p0\u22a5 +m\u039br0\u22a5|\n]\n, (12)\nwith T \u2032W (r0\u22a5, p0\u22a5) given by the same formula where L is\nreplaced by W . Thus we see that 2(T \u2032L \u2212 T \u2032W ) = \u03c4cE \u2212\n\u03c4oE, which generates a factor exp[\u2212(\u03c4cE \u2212 \u03c4oE)\/\u03c4D] and is\nindependent of (r0\u22a5, p0\u22a5). Substituting these results into\nEq. (10) for \u3008\u03b4g\u3009LR:a, and recalling that pF cos \u03b80dY0 =\ndy0d(pF sin \u03b80) = dr0\u22a5dp0\u22a5, we get\n\u3008\u03b4g\u3009LR:a = e\n\u2212(\u03c4cE\u2212\u03c4\no\nE)\/\u03c4D\n2(2\u03c0~)2\n\u222b\nL\ndr0\u22a5dp0\u22a5 e\n\u2212T \u2032W \/\u03c4D\n\u00d7Re[ exp[i(p0\u22a5 +m\u039br0\u22a5)r0\u22a5\/~]]. (13)\nWe next make the substitution p\u02dc0 = p0\u22a5 +m\u039br0\u22a5 and\nevaluate the r0\u22a5\u2212integral over a range of order W . We\ntake the limits on the resulting p\u02dc0-integral to \u00b1\u221e. One\ncan use Euler \u03b3-functions to show that\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\ndp\u02dc0\n2~ sin(p\u02dc0W\/~)\np\u02dc0\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 p\u02dc0m\u039bW\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n1\/(\u039b\u03c4D)\n= 2\u03c0~\n(\n~\nm\u039bW 2\n)1\/(\u039b\u03c4D)\n, (14)\nthe trick in evaluating this integral is to write it as\nthe sum of two integrals from 0 to \u221e. The factor\nof [~\/(m\u039bW 2)]1\/(\u039b\u03c4D) \u2243 exp[\u2212\u03c4oE\/\u03c4D], where we have\ndropped O(1)-terms inside a logarithm. This cancels\nthe \u03c4oE-term in the factor exp[\u2212(\u03c4cE\u2212 \u03c4oE)\/\u03c4D]. Collecting\nterms and evaluating some trivial integrals leads to\n\u3008\u03b4g\u3009LR:a = 1\n2\nexp[\u2212\u03c4cE\/\u03c4D]. (15)\nB. Uniform reduction of transmission and\nreflection\nWe now turn to contributions with effective encounters\nin the dot, Fig. 2(b),(c). We define an effective encounter\nas being \u201cin the dot\u201d if the parts of path \u03b3 on either side\nof the encounter separate to a distance of at least W\nbefore touching any leads. In this case, the ends of path\n\u03b3 are independent of each other, with no correlations in\ntheir position, momentum or the time at which they hit a\nlead. As in the case of the enhanced forward scattering,\nthe path \u03b3 and \u03b3\u2032 must in fact separate to a distance\nof order L before they can reconverge. Thus we have\ntwo minimal times; TL(\u01eb) for \u03b3 and \u03b3\n\u2032 to separate before\nreconverging [to the right of the encounter in Fig. 2(b)],\nand TW(\u01eb) for the two parts of \u03b3 to separate enough to\nescape independently into the leads [to the left of the\nencounter in Fig. 2(b)].\nAssuming the encounter is close (i.e. path \u03b3\u2032 crosses\nitself with very small \u01eb) and that the classical dynamics\nare hyperbolic at such small scales, one estimates\nTW (\u01eb) \u2243 \u039b\u22121 ln[\u01eb\u22122(W\/L)2], (16)\nwith TL(\u01eb) \u2243 \u039b\u22121 ln[\u01eb\u22122]. The action difference is S\u03b3 \u2212\nS\u03b3\u2032 = EF\u01eb\n2\/\u039b, just as for weak localization [8, 10]. To\nevaluate the contributions of such paths, the probability\nP\u02dc (Y,Y0; t) in the sum rule of Eq. (4) is restricted to\npaths which cross themselves, so that we can write\nP\u02dc (Y,Y0; t) =\n\u222b\nps\ndR2dR1P\u02dc (Y,R2; t\u2212 t2)\n\u00d7P\u02dc (R2,R1; t2 \u2212 t1)P\u02dc (R1,Y0; t1) , (17)\nwhere ps indicates that the integrals are over the phase\nspace of the dot. Here, we use R = (r, \u03c6), \u03c6 \u2208 [\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0]\nfor phase-space points inside the dot, while Y lies on the\nlead as before. We then restrict the probabilities inside\nthe integral to trajectories which cross their mirror im-\nage at phase-space positions R1,2 with the first (second)\nvisit to the crossing occurring at time t1 (t2). We can\nwrite dR2 = v\n2\nF sin \u01ebdt1dt2d\u01eb and set R2 = (r\n\u2032\n1, \u03c6\n\u2032\n1 \u00b1 \u01eb),\nwhere r\u20321 and \u03c6\n\u2032\n1 are the mirror images of position r1\nand angle \u03c61 (thus \u03c6\n\u2032\n1 = \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c61). Then the correc-\ntion to the dimensionless conductance is \u3008\u03b4g\u3009LR:b =\n(\u03c0~)\u22121\n\u222b\nL\ndY0\n\u222b\nd\u01ebRe\n[\nei(S\u03b3\u2212S\u03b3\u2032)\/~\n]\u2329\nF (Y0, \u01eb)\n\u232a\n, with\nF (Y0, \u01eb) = 2v\n2\nF sin \u01eb\n\u222b \u221e\nTL+TW\ndt\n\u222b t\u2212TW\n2\nTL+\nTW\n2\ndt2\n\u222b t2\u2212TL\nTW\n2\ndt1\n\u00d7pF cos \u03b80\n\u222b\nR\ndY\n\u222b\nps\ndR1P\u02dc (Y,R2; t\u2212 t2)\n\u00d7P\u02dc (R2,R1; t2 \u2212 t1)P\u02dc (R1,Y0; t1). (18)\nComparison with Eq. (34) of Ref. [12] shows that this has\nthe same form as the weak localization correction. Thus\nwe only briefly summarize the remainder of the derivation\nhere. Assuming phase space ergodicity for the system, we\nhave\n\u3008F (Y0, \u01eb)\u3009 = 2v\n2\nF\u03c4\n2\nD\n2\u03c0A\nNR\nNL +NR\n\u00d7pF cos \u03b80 sin \u01eb exp\n[\u2212 TL(\u01eb)\/\u03c4D], (19)\n7with A being the real space volume occupied\nby the system (the area of the dot). Then\nthe integral over \u01eb in \u3008\u03b4g\u3009LR:b takes the form\nRe\n\u222b\u221e\n0\nd\u01eb \u01eb1+2\/(\u039b\u03c4D) exp[iEF\u01eb\n2\/(\u039b~)], where we have as-\nsumed \u01eb \u226a 1 [12]. The substitution z = EF\u01eb2\/(\u039b~)\nimmediately yields a dimensionless integral and an expo-\nnential term, e\u2212\u03c4\ncl\nE \/\u03c4D (neglecting as usual O[1]-terms in\nthe logarithm in \u03c4clE ). From this analysis, we find that\nthis interference correction to the conductance is given\nby \u3008\u03b4g\u3009LR:b = \u2212 14 exp[\u2212\u03c4cE\/\u03c4D].\nThe backscattering contribution in Fig. 2(c) does not\ndirectly enter the conductance. However, we must eval-\nuate it if we wish to explicitly show that the theory con-\nserves particles. If interference causes an enhancement of\ntransmission then there must be an associated reduction\nof reflection; it is the paths in Fig. 2(c) that give this\nreduction of reflection, which we denote by \u3008\u03b4R\u3009LR:c. In-\nspecting the figure we see that this contribution is of the\nsame form as Eq. (18), but with the Y-integral now over\ntaken over lead L instead of lead R. Thus we find that\n\u3008\u03b4R\u3009LR:c = \u3008\u03b4g\u3009LR:b so \u3008\u03b4g\u3009LR:a+\u3008\u03b4g\u3009LR:b+\u3008\u03b4R\u3009LR:c = 0,\nwhich confirms that the theory conserves particles.\nC. Asymmetry and dephasing in the dot\nWe now turn to the effect of deformations of the dot\u2019s\nshape which break the left-right mirror symmetry. We\nconsider two cases; the first is a small deformation of\na large proportion of the dot\u2019s boundary, see Fig. 3(a),\nand the second is a large deformation of a small propor-\ntion of the dot\u2019s boundary, see Fig. 3(b). Other types of\ndeformation can be understood by applying the method-\nology we introduce for these two cases. In general, the\neffect of asymmetries on symmetry-induced interference\ncorrections to the conductance is similar to the effect of\nmagnetic fields and dephasing on weak localization for a\ncompletely asymmetric dot [10].\nConsider the left side of the dot being deformed such\nthat the boundary is rippled, see the sketch in Fig. 3(a).\nThe ripple does not change in time, and has a small am-\nplitude \u03b4L < \u03bbF and long range Wasym \u226b \u03bbF (the lat-\nter condition ensures that there is no problem using the\nsemiclassical theory). The simplest such case is when\nthe whole left side of the dot deformed slightly outwards,\nwhich corresponds to Wasym \u223c L. Then a path in the\nleft half of the dot which bounces from this portion of\nthe dot boundary will travel a distance of order \u03b4L fur-\nther than its partner in the right half. We assume that\nthis small difference has no significant effect on the clas-\nsical trajectories but changes the phase acquired along\nthe path and thereby modifies the interference with its\nsymmetry-related partner. Paths are chaotic and reg-\nularly switch between the left and right halves of the\ndot. Thus it is reasonable to assume the length difference\nbetween a path segment of time t \u226b \u03c40 and its mirror\nimage is the sum of many independent random lengths\ndistributed such that \u3008\u03b4L\u3009 = 0 and p2F\u3008\u03b4L2\u3009 \u226a ~2, where\nthe average is over the whole circumference of the dot.\nThus the action difference for a path segment of time t\n(which therefore bounces t\/\u03c40 times) and its mirror im-\nage is\n\u2329\nexp[i(S\u03b3 \u2212 S\u03b3\u2032)\/~]\n\u232a\n=\n\u220ft\/\u03c40\nn=1\u3008exp[ipF\u03b4L\/~]\u3009n. Ir-\nrespective of the probability distribution of each \u03b4L, we\ncan use central limit theorem to tell us that the probabil-\nity distribution for (S\u03b3 \u2212 S\u03b3\u2032) is a Gaussian (Bell-curve)\nwith variance given by the sum of the variances of the\nindividual \u03b4Ls; thus for times t\u226b \u03c40 we have\nvar[S\u03b3 \u2212 S\u03b3\u2032 ] \u2243 (t\/\u03c40)\u3008\u03b4L\u3009\/\u03bb2F. (20)\nThus\n\u2329\nexp[i(S\u03b3 \u2212S\u03b3\u2032)\/~]\n\u232a\n, which is given by a Gaussian\nintegral over S\u03b3 \u2212 S\u03b3\u2032 . Evaluating this integral, we find\nthat \u2329\nexp[i(S\u03b3 \u2212 S\u03b3\u2032)\/~]\n\u232a\n= exp[\u2212\u03b3asymt] (21)\nwith decay rate\n\u03b3asym = \u3008\u03b4L2\u3009\/(2\u03c40\u03bb2F). (22)\nNow we turn to the question of when such random phase\ndifferences occur for the interference contributions to con-\nductance. In the contributions we discuss, paths \u03b3 and\n\u03b3\u2032 are nearly identical when they enter the effective en-\ncounter, while \u03b3 is paired with the image of \u03b3\u2032 when\nthey exit the encounter. The acquisition of the random\nphases discussed above only starts to occur once path \u03b3\nand \u03b3\u2032 are a distance Wasym or more apart. When the\ntwo paths are closer than Wasym, they do acquire ex-\ntra phases due to the deformation; however, the phase\ndifference between them is negligible. We assume that\nWasym \u226b \u03bbF, so we can avoid worrying about diffrac-\ntive scattering from the deformed boundary (it remains\nsmooth at the scale of the Fermi wavelength).\nWe first consider the effect of asymmetry on the co-\nherent forward-scattering contribution of Fig. 2(a), dis-\ncussed in Sect. IVA. In this contribution, almost ev-\nerywhere the paths \u03b3 and \u03b3\u2032 are the mirror image of\neach other; the exception is an interval of duration\n(t \u2212 2T \u2032Wasym) where the paths separate to a distance\nof order Wasym [here T\n\u2032\nWasym\nis given in Eq. (12) with\nWasym in place of L]. Thus the integral over time t\nin Eq. (11) acquires another factor of the form exp\n[ \u2212\n\u03b3asym(t \u2212 2T \u2032Wasym)\n]\n. Thus asymmetry has a similar ef-\nfect as dephasing, which contributes a factor of the form\nexp[\u2212\u03b3\u03c6(t \u2212 2T \u2032\u03be)] [30, 31]; here T \u2032\u03be is given by Eq. (12),\nwith the noise correlation length \u03be in place of L (see\nSection IIIA and references therein). The integral in\nEq.

In\n(b) a small part of the boundary of the left half (of width Wasym) is deformed by a distance \u03b4L\u226b \u03bbF. In the former case the\nparameter which controls the deviation from symmetry is \u03b4L\/\u03bbF while in the latter case it is Wasym\/L.\nwhere for compactness we define two effective phase cor-\nrelation times \u03c4\u02dc = 2(T \u2032L\u2212T \u2032\u03be) and \u03c4\u02dcasym = 2(T \u2032L\u2212T \u2032Wasym)\nfor dephasing and asymmetries, respectively, which take\nthe explicit form\n\u03c4\u02dc = \u039b\u22121 ln\n[\n(L\/\u03be)2\n]\n,\n\u03c4\u02dcasym = \u039b\n\u22121 ln\n[\n(L\/Wasym)\n2\n]\n. (24)\nIf the length scale of the deformation of the boundary,\nWasym, is of order L then we can treat \u03c4\u02dcasym \u2243 0. Simi-\nlarly, for dephasing, we can treat \u03c4\u02dc \u2243 0 for \u03be \u223c 0; how-\never, for electron-electron interactions in the dot, \u03c4\u02dc is\ngiven by the Ehrenfest time \u03c4cE (see Ref. [29] and Sect.\nIIIA of Ref. [31], which reviews that work using a similar\nnotation as the present article).\nCompared to Eq. (11), Eq. (23) contains an additional\nconstant factor. The remaining derivation of the con-\ntribution of coherent forward scattering can therefore\nproceed exactly as in Section IVA. The final result is\n\u3008\u03b4g\u3009LR:a = 12 exp[\u2212\u03c4cE\/\u03c4D]\u00d7 ZLR(\u03b3asym, \u03b3\u03c6), with\nZLR(\u03b3asym, \u03b3\u03c6) =\nexp[\u2212\u03b3\u03c6\u03c4\u02dc \u2212 \u03b3asym\u03c4\u02dcasym]\n1 + (\u03b3asym + \u03b3\u03c6)\u03c4D\n. (25)\nTurning to the other interference contributions for a\nleft-right symmetric dot, Fig. 2(b),(c), we carry out a\nsimilar analysis for the parts of the paths which are\napproximate mirror images of each other. Measuring\nfrom the encounter, the paths diverge to a distance\nWasym apart in a time TWasym\/2, at which point the\nasymmetry-induced suppression sets in. Similarly, the\npaths diverge to a distance \u03be apart in a time T\u03be\/2,\nat which point the dephasing-induced suppression sets;\nhere the time T\u03be and TWasym are given by Eq. (16)\nwith \u03be and Wasym, respectively, in place of W . The\nasymmetry suppresses the interference term by a factor\nexp[\u2212\u03b3asym(t2\u2212 t1\u2212TWasym)], while dephasing results in\na suppression of the form exp[\u2212\u03b3\u03c6(t2\u2212 t1\u2212T\u03be)]. Repeat-\ning the analysis in Section IVB with these extra terms,\nwe find that \u3008\u03b4g\u3009LR:b and \u3008\u03b4R\u3009LR:c are also suppressed\nby factors of ZLR(\u03b3asym, \u03b3\u03c6).\nIt is noteworthy that the expression for \u3008\u03b4g\u3009LR:a,\n\u3008\u03b4g\u3009LR:b, and \u3008\u03b4R\u3009LR:c all are independent of the mag-\nnetic field, which is quite unlike the weak localization cor-\nrection given by Eqs. (6,7). The reason for the magnetic-\nfield independence lies in the orientation of trajectory\nsegments in symmetry-related pairs of paths \u03b3, \u03b3\u2032. In all\ncontributions, when both paths are not approximately\nthe same, they are approximately related by taking the\nmirror image and time-reverse. While the flux enclosed\nby a path changes its sign by mirror reflection or time re-\nversal, the combined action of both operations results in\na path which encloses the same flux as the original path.\nAs a result, the phase induced by the magnetic field is\nexactly the same for path \u03b3 and \u03b3\u2032 and drops out of the\ninterference contributions, since the latter only contain\nthe phase difference. This is in stark contrast to the weak\nlocalization correction, where the symmetric partner of\na path is just its time-reverse, which means the flux en-\nclosed by \u03b3 and \u03b3\u2032 is opposite (in section V we encounter\na similar situation in a dot with inversion symmetry).\nWe now turn to local deformations as sketched in\nFig. 3(b). If neither path \u03b3 nor \u03b3\u2032 go into the deformed\nregion while they are approximate mirror images of each\nother, then there is no phase shift, and the contribution\nis the same as for a perfectly symmetric system. How-\never, if one of the paths enters the deformed region while\npaired with the mirror image of the other it will immedi-\nately acquire a phase difference of (S\u03b3\u2212S\u03b3\u2032)\/~ \u226b 1, and\nwill fluctuate strongly under energy or ensemble averag-\ning. The resulting average\n\u2329\nexp[i(S\u03b3 \u2212 S\u03b3\u2032)\/~]\n\u232a\nis still\ngiven by Eq. (21), but the decay rate now takes the form\n\u03b3asym =Wasym\/(2\u03c40C) = \u03c4\n\u22121\nD (Wasym\/W ), (26)\nwhere C is the circumference of the cavity and Wasym\nis the width of the deformation [see Fig. 3(b)]. This\nasymmetry-induced suppression can only set in once the\ntwo paths are a distance of orderWasym apart (only then\ncan one path hit the deformation while the other does\nnot), which results in an additional factor exp[\u2212(TL \u2212\nTWasym)\/\u03c4D], where TWasym is given by Eq. (16) with\nWasym in place of W . Following through the calcula-\n9tion we arrive once again at Eq. (25) but now with \u03b3asym\ngiven by Eq. (26); \u03c4\u02dc and \u03c4\u02dcasym are unchanged and given\nby Eq. (24).\nIntriguingly, unlike the dephasing rate Eq. (22) in-\nduced by the global asymmetry in Fig. 3(a), the de-\nphasing rate Eq. (26) induced by the localized asymme-\ntry in Fig. 3(b) is wavelength-independent. Thus Wasym\ncan be a classical scale (much bigger than \u03bbF while re-\nmaining less than W ) without destroying the symmetry-\ninduced effects. For example, even if Wasym \u223c W we\nhave \u03b3asym\u03c4D \u223c 1 and the symmetry-induced effect is\nonly suppressed by a factor of two (then the exponential\nsuppression, exp[\u2212\u03b3asym\u03c4\u02dcasym], is almost irrelevant since\nthe exponent contains a logarithm with a small prefactor\n(\u039b\u03c4D)\n\u22121 \u226a 1).\nD. The conductance of a left-right symmetric dot\nincluding interference corrections\nThe total interference correction to the conductance\ninduced by the left-right mirror symmetry is given\nby \u3008\u03b4g\u3009LR = \u3008\u03b4g\u3009LR:a + \u3008\u03b4g\u3009LR:b = 14 exp[\u2212\u03c4cE\/\u03c4D] \u00d7\nZLR(\u03b3asym, \u03b3\u03c6), with ZLR(\u03b3asym, \u03b3\u03c6) given by Eq. (25).\nThus a quantum dot with symmetric leads has a total\naverage conductance of\n\u3008g\u3009LR = \u3008g\u3009D + \u3008\u03b4g\u3009wl + \u3008\u03b4g\u3009LR\n=\nN\n2\n+\n1\n4\nexp[\u2212\u03c4cE\/\u03c4D]\n[\nZLR(\u03b3asym, \u03b3\u03c6)\u2212 Z(B, \u03b3\u03c6)\n]\n+ O[N\u22121]. (27)\nIn the absence of spatial symmetries, the higher-order\nweak localization corrections (order N\u22121, etc) were eval-\nuated in Ref. [11]. Symmetry also induces corrections to\nthese orders, but they are beyond the analysis that we\ncarry out here.\nAs noted in Refs. [22, 23], for perfect left-right mirror\nsymmetry and perfect time-reversal symmetry (no mag-\nnetic field) the two interference corrections to the conduc-\ntance exactly cancel, so that the conductance is given by\nthe classical Drude conductance (5). Interestingly, our\ncalculation shows that this statement remains true for\narbitrary dephasing rate and Ehrenfest time, which en-\nter all symmetry-induced corrections with the same func-\ntional dependence. However, a magnetic field suppresses\nthe negative weak localization correction, but does not\naffect the corrections from mirror symmetry. Thus the\nmagneto-conductance curve of a symmetric dot looks like\nthe shifted curve of an asymmetric dot; the shift is pos-\nitive and equals 1\/4 in the RMT limit (\u03c4\u03c6 \u226b \u03c4D \u226b \u03c4E).\nFor Wasym \u223c L (relevant for deformations in Fig. 3(a))\nthe correction has a Lorentzian dependence on the mag-\nnitude of the deformation \u03b4L. For Wasym \u226a L, the\nform of the suppression is more complicated and given\nin Eq. (25).\n(c) Reduction of reflection due to the inversion symmetry \n(a) Enhancement of transmission due to the inversion symmetry \n(b) Reduction of transmission due to the inversion symmetry \n\u2019\u03b3\n\u2019\u03b3\n\u2019\u03b3\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\nFigure 4: (colour online). Contributions to weak localization\ndue to an inversion symmetry, which is equivalent to symme-\ntry under a 180\u25e6 rotation about the point indicated by \u2295. In\nthe folded sketches on the right-hand side, paths that end on\nthe left lead are marked with solid circles, while those that\nend on the right lead are marked with open (red) circles (as in\nFig. 2). When we fold all paths into one half of the dot (see the\nright-hand sketches) by rotating the other half of the dot by\n180\u25e6, any path which crosses the line between the two halves\n(dashed line) at (r, p) reappears at (\u2212r,\u2212p), where r = 0 is\ndefined as the centre of the inversion symmetry (marked \u2295).\nThe sketch in (a) is an enhanced forward-scattering contribu-\ntion similar to that in Fig. 2(a).\nV. INVERSION SYMMETRY\nThe effect of inversion symmetry is similar to left-right\nmirror symmetry. In particular both symmetries map the\nL lead onto the R lead and vice versa. As the only major\ndifference, inversion symmetry preserves the orientation\nof closed loops, which results in a different magnetic-field\ndependence of the interference contributions.\nFig. 4 shows the pairs of paths which give interference\ncorrections due to the inversion symmetry. Here path\n\u03b3\u2032 is the symmetric partner of path \u03b3 if the mapping\nfrom \u03b3\u2032 to \u03b3 is inversion plus time-reversal. Compari-\nson with Fig. 2 reveals the similarity of these pairs with\nthe equivalent pairs in a left-right mirror symmetric dot.\nThe only difference is the orientation of loops. Looking\nat Fig. 4(a) one sees that the flux enclosed by a path is\nunchanged under inversion, but then changes sign under\ntime-reversal. Thus a path encloses the opposite amount\nof flux from its \u201csymmetric partner\u201d. This is the same\n10\nas in a weak localization loop [10] (where the symmet-\nric partner of a path is simply its time-reverse), and so\nwe can expect that the interference corrections induced\nby the inversion symmetry follow the same Lorentzian\nmagnetic-field suppression [see Eq. (7)].\nWhen performing the calculation of the contributions\n\u3008\u03b4g\u3009inv, the only difference from that for \u3008\u03b4g\u3009LR in Sec-\ntion IV is therefore an extra suppression of the form\nexp[\u2212(t\/\u03c40)(B\/B0)2], which is incurred during the time\nwhen paths are approximate symmetric partners (rather\nthan being approximately identical). This exponential\nsuppression can be obtained [10] by noting that a path\nsegment acquires a phase eBA\/h between two bounces\nfrom the dot\u2019s boundary, where A is the directed area\nenclosed by the triangle defined by the straight path seg-\nment and a third point (say, the point at the centre of\nthe dot). For a chaotic path, A can be treated as a ran-\ndom variable with \u3008A\u3009 = 0 and \u3008A2\u3009 \u223c A2, where A is\nthe area of the dot. Assuming the phase acquired be-\ntween two bounces is small, we can use the central limit\ntheorem to obtain the average value of the phase fac-\ntor exp[i\u03a6B(t)] for a path segment of duration t (which\ntherefore bounces t\/\u03c40 times),\n\u2329\nexp[i\u03a6B(t)]\n\u232a\n=\nt\/\u03c40\u220f\ni=0\n\u2329\nexp[ieBA\/h]\n\u232a\n= exp[\u2212(t\/\u03c40)(B\/B0)2]. (28)\nIn all contributions, this factor simply adds to the\nasymmetry- and dephasing-induced suppression. The fi-\nnal result is\n\u3008g\u3009inv = N\n2\n+\n1\n4\ne\u2212\u03c4\nc\nE\/\u03c4D [Zinv(B, \u03b3asym, \u03b3\u03c6)\u2212 Z(B, \u03b3\u03c6)]\n+ O[N\u22121] (29)\nwhere we define N = NL = NR. The suppression due to\na magnetic field, asymmetry or dephasing is given by\nZinv(B, \u03b3asym, \u03b3\u03c6) =\nexp[\u2212\u03b3\u03c6\u03c4\u02dc \u2212 \u03b3asym\u03c4\u02dcasym]\n1 + (B\/Bc)2 + (\u03b3asym + \u03b3\u03c6)\u03c4D\n.(30)\nThis is similar to Eq. (25) for a left-right symmetry, but\nhas an extra magnetic-field dependent term in the de-\nnominator. Just as for left-right symmetry we have also\ncalculated the contributions to reflection, and verified\nthat particle number is conserved.\nVI. UP-DOWN MIRROR SYMMETRY\nThe case of up-down mirror symmetry is different from\nthe symmetries we have already considered because this\nsymmetry maps each lead onto itself. Figure 5 shows the\npairs of paths which contribute to the associated inter-\nference corrections; in contrast to the earlier cases there\nis now only one contribution to transmission [that shown\nin Fig. 5(c)].\n(b) Reduction of reflection due to up\u2212down symmetry \n(c) Reduction of transmission due to up\u2212down symmetry \n(a) Enhancement of reflection due to up\u2212down symmetry \n\u2019\u03b3\n\u2019\u03b3\n\u2019\u03b3\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\nFigure 5: (colour online). Contributions to weak localization\ndue to an up-down mirror symmetry for a dot with symmet-\nric leads. The sketch in (a) is an enhanced backscattering\ncontribution; there are no enhanced forward-scattering con-\ntributions (unlike for left-right and inversion-symmetric dots).\nDespite the difference in topology from the equivalent\npairs in a left-right symmetric dot (shown in Fig. 2), the\ncalculations of the contributions are still similar in the\ntwo cases. The integrals we have to evaluate for each con-\ntribution in Fig. 5 have the same form as the equivalent\ncontribution in Fig. 2, except that some integrals over\nlead R now become integrals over lead L, and vice-versa.\nFor symmetric leads (i.e., leads that may have different\nwidths, but must both be centred on the symmetry axis)\nwe then find\n\u3008\u03b4g\u3009UD = \u2212 NLNR\n(NL +NR)2\nexp[\u2212\u03c4cE\/\u03c4 (UD)D ]\n\u00d7ZUD(\u03b3asym, \u03b3\u03c6), (31)\nwhere ZUD(\u03b3asym, \u03b3\u03c6) has the same form as\nZLR(\u03b3asym, \u03b3\u03c6) given in Eq. (25). For the same\nreason as for left-right symmetry (but unlike the case\nof inversion symmetry), there is no magnetic-field\ndependence. If we sum all the contributions in Fig. 5\nwe get zero, so the above reduction of transmission is\nexactly compensated by an enhancement of reflection,\n11\nand therefore particles are conserved.\nIn combination with the weak localization correc-\ntion, the average conductance of an up-down mirror-\nsymmetric dot is\n\u3008g\u3009UD = NLNR\nNL +NR\n(32)\n\u2212 NLNR\n(NL +NR)2\n[\nexp[\u2212\u03c4cE\/\u03c4 (UD)D ] ZUD(\u03b3asym, \u03b3\u03c6)\n+ exp[\u2212\u03c4cE\/\u03c4D] Z(B, \u03b3\u03c6)\n]\n+ O[N\u22121L,R],\nwhere for simplicity we assume that \u03c4\u02dc and \u03c4\u02dcasym are small\nenough to be neglected. For perfect symmetry and van-\nishing magnetic field, the interference correction to the\nconductance is exactly twice that of weak localization\nalone; this is the case for any lead widths, Ehrenfest time\nor dephasing rate.\nVII. FOUR-FOLD SYMMETRY\nA quantum dot with four-fold symmetry has all three\nof the spatial symmetries that we discuss in this arti-\ncle. The interference corrections to the conductance of\nsuch a four-fold symmetric quantum dot are simply the\nsum of the corrections due to each of these three sym-\nmetries. The presence of the extra symmetries has no\neffect on the contributions which do not respect those\nsymmetries, so we can directly take the results we al-\nready calculated. The only problem is that we have to\navoid double-counting any contributions where a path\nand its symmetric partner respect more than one of the\nabove symmetries. Luckily such path-pairs are vanish-\ningly rare. For example, to construct a pair of paths\nrelated by both left-right and inversion symmetry, one\nrequire that both paths go through the left-right mirror\naxis exactly perpendicular to that axis; only a vanishing\nsmall proportion of the paths in the dot do this. Thus\n\u3008\u03b4g\u30094F = \u3008\u03b4g\u3009LR + \u3008\u03b4g\u3009UD + \u3008\u03b4g\u3009inv (33)\n=\n1\n4\nexp[\u2212\u03c4cE\/\u03c4D]\n[\nZLR(\u03b3\nLR\nasym, \u03b3\u03c6)\n+Zinv(B, \u03b3\ninv\nasym, \u03b3\u03c6)\u2212 ZUD(\u03b3UDasym, \u03b3\u03c6)\n]\n. (34)\nFor an arbitrary deformation of the dot, one can assume\nthat all three symmetries will be affected about equally,\n\u03b3LRasym \u2243 \u03b3invasym \u2243 \u03b3UDasym. However, one could also consider\na deformation which respects one of the symmetries, so\nthat the corresponding \u03b3asym will be zero, but the other\ntwo will be finite (and typically of similar magnitude).\nFor perfect symmetry, we have \u3008\u03b4g\u3009LR = \u2212\u3008\u03b4g\u3009UD. Hence\nin that case \u3008\u03b4g\u30094F = \u3008\u03b4g\u3009inv for arbitrary magnetic fields,\nEhrenfest time and dephasing rate.\nVIII. UNIVERSAL CONDUCTANCE\nFLUCTUATIONS\nIn the case of perfect spatial symmetry the universal\nconductance fluctuations (UCFs) are much easier to ana-\nlyze than the interference corrections to the conductance\nitself. Each spatial symmetry doubles the size of every\ncontribution, in exactly the way that introducing time-\nreversal symmetry doubles the conductance fluctuations\nin a dot without spatial symmetry (this is also the case\nin disordered systems, for a review see Ref. [36]). This\nleads immediately to the results given in Table I.\nTo see from semiclassics why this is the case, we turn\nto Fig. 6. Contributions to conductance fluctuations in-\nvolve two paths, \u03b31 and \u03b32, from y0 on lead L to y on lead\nR, which are completely uncorrelated for part (or all) of\ntheir time in the dot. These paths are then paired with\nanother two paths, \u03b3\u20321 and \u03b3\n\u2032\n2 (this time from y\n\u2032\n0 on lead\nL to y\u2032 on lead R). If there are no spatial symmetries and\nno time-reversal symmetry, then there is only one possi-\nble pairing which survives averaging: the parts of \u03b31 and\n\u03b32 which are not paired with each other must be paired\nwith \u03b3\u20322 and \u03b3\n\u2032\n1 respectively. Time-reversal symmetry in-\nduces a second possibility, namely to pair \u03b3\u20322 and \u03b3\n\u2032\n1 with\nthe time-reverse of the parts of \u03b31 and \u03b32 which are not\npaired with each other. Therefore UCFs in time-reversal\nsymmetric systems are double the magnitude of UCFs in\nsystems without time-reversal symmetry.\nThe same logic applies to systems with spatial sym-\nmetries. If the system has a left-right symmetry, then\none can pair \u03b3\u20322 and \u03b3\n\u2032\n1 with the mirror image of the\nparts of \u03b31 and \u03b32 which are not paired with each other\n[see Fig. 6(a) for an example of this]. Thus the presence\nof a left-right symmetry doubles the magnitude of the\nUCFs. The same additional pairings also occur for up-\ndown and inversion symmetry. For multiple symmetries\nthe effects are multiplicative; assuming that there are n\nindependent symmetries one finds 2n ways to pair paths,\nmeaning the UCFs are 2n times larger than for a sys-\ntem with no symmetries. A four-fold symmetry has two\nindependent symmetries (one possible choice is left-right\nand up-down mirror symmetry, the inversion symmetry\nbeing then just a consequence of these two). Fig. 6(b)\nshows the four possible pairings in such a case.\nA. The effect of magnetic fields and asymmetries\non UCFs\nAsymmetries have a similar effect on paths paired with\ntheir mirror-symmetric partner, as magnetic fields have\non paths paired with their time-reverse. Path-pairs where\neach path is the time-reverse of the other (cooperons)\ndecay with a factor of exp[\u2212t\/\u03c4D\u2212 \u03c4\u221210 (B\/B0)2t], rather\nthan the factor of exp[\u2212t\/\u03c4D] for pairs where both paths\nare the same (diffusons). Upon integrating over the\nlength t of such pairs, one sees that for each pair in which\nthe paths are the time-reverse of each other, one gets an\n12\n1\u03b3\n2\u03b3\n2\u03b3\n1\u03b3\neffective \nin dot\nencounters\n1\u03b3\n\u2019 \u2019 \u2019 21 1\u03b3\u03b3 \u03b3\nLeft\u2212right sym.\nUp\u2212down sym.\n(b)\n(a)\nInversion sym.\nFigure 6: (colour online). (a) A contribution to universal conductance fluctuations in a left-right mirror-symmetric system.\nOn the right we show the same contribution folded into half the dot, such that one can see the two effective encounters (we\nonly show the dashed paths at the encounters). (b) The full list of pairings for path \u03b31 and \u03b32, with left-right, up-down and\ninversion symmetry. There are also contributions in which paths are paired with the time-reverse of their images (arrows\nreversed); indeed (a) is an example of this for a left-right symmetric system.\nextra factor of [1 + (B\/Bc)\n2]\u22121 where Bc is given in Eq.\n(2). Ref. [15] shows that there are two such pairs for zero\nEhrenfest time, but only one pair for infinite Ehrenfest\ntime; this observation leads to the result given in Eq. (9).\nThis methodology can be directly carried over to asym-\nmetries in a spatially symmetric system. Just as for\nweak localization, pairs where each path is the mirror-\nsymmetric of the other decay with a factor of exp[\u2212t\/\u03c4D\u2212\n\u03b3asymt] rather than simply exp[\u2212t\/\u03c4D]. The asymmetry-\ninduced decay rate \u03b3asym is given by Eq. (22) for asym-\nmetries of the type shown in Fig. 3(a), and by Eq. (26)\nfor asymmetries of the type shown in Fig. 3(b).\nWe next consider the effect of perpendicular magnetic\nfields. Looking at the left-right mirror-symmetric paths\nin Fig. 6(b), we see that they enclose the opposite di-\nrected area, so if we pair segments of path \u03b3\u20322 and \u03b3\n\u2032\n1\nwith the mirror image of segments of \u03b31 and \u03b32, respec-\ntively, then the Aharonov-Bohm flux will be twice that\nenclosed by paths \u03b31 and \u03b32. In contrast, if we pair seg-\nments of path \u03b3\u20322 and \u03b3\n\u2032\n1 with the time-reverse of the\nmirror image of segments of \u03b31 and \u03b32, respectively, then\nthe Aharonov-Bohm flux will cancel. Thus we have a\nfactor of [1 + (B\/Bc)\n2 + \u03b3asym\u03c4D]\n\u22121 for each pair con-\ntaining paths that are the mirror image of each other,\nand a factor of [1 + \u03b3asym\u03c4D]\n\u22121 for each pair containing\npaths where one is the time-reverse of the mirror image\nof the other.\nAs for the contributions in Ref. [15], the zero-Ehrenfest\ntime contributions have two pairs which are not the same,\nwhile the infinite-Ehrenfest time contributions have only\none. Thus for left-right mirror symmetry we find\nvar[g]LR =\n1\n16\n[\nZucf(B) + Zucfsym(B, \u03b3\nLR\nasym)\n]\n, (35)\nwhere ZUCF(B) is given in Eq. (9) and\nZucfsym(B, \u03b3asym)\n=\ne\u2212\u03c4\no\nE\/\u03c4D\n[1 + \u03b3asym\u03c4D]2\n+\ne\u2212\u03c4\no\nE\/\u03c4D\n[1 + \u03b3asym\u03c4D + (B\/Bc)2]2\n+\n1\u2212 e\u2212\u03c4oE\/\u03c4D\n1 + \u03b3asym\u03c4D\n+\n1\u2212 e\u2212\u03c4oE\/\u03c4D\n1 + \u03b3asym\u03c4D + (B\/Bc)2\n. (36)\n13\nFor perfect mirror symmetry (as in the absence of spatial\nsymmetries [15]), the magnitude of the UCFs for B \u226a\nBc and B \u226b Bc is independent of the Ehrenfest time,\nbut the crossover from one to the other is given by a\nLorentzian in the classical limit (\u03c4oE \u226b \u03c4D) and by a\nLorentzian-squared in the random-matrix limit (\u03c4oE \u226a\n\u03c4D). Similarly for B \u226a Bc or B \u226b Bc, the crossover from\nsymmetric to asymmetric is given by [1 + \u03b3asym\u03c4D]\n\u22121 in\nthe classical limit and by [1+ \u03b3asym\u03c4D]\n\u22122 in the random-\nmatrix limit.\nThe same logic follows for up-down symmetry. In con-\ntrast, for the case of an inversion symmetry there is a\nsmall difference. Then, if we pair segments of path \u03b3\u20322\nand \u03b3\u20321 with the image (under the symmetry) of segments\nof \u03b31 and \u03b32, respectively, the Aharonov-Bohm flux can-\ncel. If on the other hand we pair segments of path \u03b3\u20322\nand \u03b3\u20321 with the time-reverse of the image (under the\nsymmetry) of segments of \u03b31 and \u03b32, respectively, then\nthe Aharonov-Bohm will be twice that enclosed by paths\n\u03b31 and \u03b32. This means that the contributions to UCFs\nwhich survive at finite magnetic field (B \u226b Bc) for inver-\nsion symmetry are exactly those that do not survive for\nleft-right or up-down mirror symmetry, and vice versa.\nEven though different individual contributions are sup-\npressed for the different symmetries, the total suppres-\nsion of UCFs by magnetic fields or asymmetries has the\nsame form in all three cases, given by Zucfsym(B, \u03b3asym) in\nEq. (36), where \u03b3asym measures the deviations from the\nrelevant symmetry.\nFrom this one immediately gets\nvar[g]inv =\n1\n16\n[\nZucf(B) + Zucfsym(B, \u03b3\ninv\nasym)\n]\n(37)\nand\nvar[g]UD =\nN2LN\n2\nR\n(NL +NR)4\n[\nZucf(B) + Zucfsym(B, \u03b3\nUD\nasym)\n]\n.(38)\nFor four-fold symmetry, the expression for the UCFs\ncontains four terms; the first is from Eq. (9) while each\nof the others comes from one of the spatial symmetries\nthat a four-fold system respects. Thus\nvar[g]4F =\n1\n16\n[\nZucf(B) + Zucfsym(B, \u03b3\nLR\nasym)\n+Zucfsym(B, \u03b3\ninv\nasym) + Z\nucf\nsym(B, \u03b3\nUD\nasym)\n]\n. (39)\nAs we discussed for weak localization, an arbitrary defor-\nmation of the dot is likely to affect all three symmetries\nabout equally, with \u03b3LRasym \u2243 \u03b3invasym \u2243 \u03b3UDasym. However,\none could also have a deformation which respects one\nof the symmetries; then the corresponding \u03b3asym will be\nzero, while the other two are finite.\nFor perfect spatial symmetry with B \u226a Bc we\nhave Zucfsym(B, \u03b3asym) = 2, and a four-fold system has\nUCFs of magnitude 1\/2 irrespective of the Ehrenfest\ntime. For perfect symmetry with B \u226b Bc we have\nZucfsym(B, \u03b3asym) = 1, and a four-fold system has UCFs\nof magnitude 1\/4 irrespective of the Ehrenfest time.\nB = 0 B \u226b Bc\nno spatial sym.

COMPARISON TO RANDOM-MATRIX\nTHEORY\nIn this section we compare the semiclassical predictions\nderived in the previous sections to numerical results ob-\ntained from a phenomenological random-matrix model.\nFor simplicity, we assume \u03c4oE \u226a \u03c4D and no dephasing\nand consider the crossover of quantum-interference ef-\nfects induced by a magnetic field in cavities of fixed spa-\ntial symmetry, as well as the crossover when the mag-\nnetic field is fixed but the shape is changed to break one\nor more spatial symmetries. We concentrate on the case\nNL = NR = N .\nOur results are based on an efficient interpolation\nscheme between \u2018pure\u2019 random-matrix ensembles which\nrepresent the limiting scenarios of vanishing or strong\nmagnetic field at fully preserved or broken spatial sym-\nmetry. We interpolate between these ensembles by means\nof a procedure which combines the ideas of two construc-\ntions used in earlier related works: the stub model of\nRefs. [37, 38], and the dynamical scattering model of\nRefs. [39, 40].\nThe main common feature of our interpolation proce-\ndure and the stub model is the idea to introduce a con-\ntrollable coupling to a symmetry-breaking or magnetic\nauxiliary system. Ordinarily, this coupling is introduced\non the basis of an internal scattering matrix which par-\ntially couples to the leads and partially couples to the\nauxiliary system.\nIt is beneficial to adapt this approach in a manner\nwhich more clearly separates the modifications in the in-\nternal dynamics from the coupling to the leads. This can\nbe achieved by first focussing on an M \u00d7M -dimensional\nunitary evolution operator F which represents the inter-\nnal dynamics of the system. The operator F is taken from\na crossover ensemble which we construct by coupling the\nsymmetric system to a symmetry-breaking system, where\n14\n-0.4\n-0.2\n 0\n 0.2\n 0.4\n 0  0.2  0.4  0.6  0.8  1\n \n\u2329 \u03b4\n \ng \n\u232a \n\u03bb\nWL for crossover from B=0 to finite B\n up\/down\n right\/left\n inversion\n four-fold\nasymmetric\n 0\n 0.1\n 0.2\n 0.3\n 0.4\n 0.5\n 0  0.2  0.4  0.6  0.8  1\nv\nar\n [g\n]\n\u03bb\nUCF for crossover from B=0 to finite B\n up\/down\n right\/left\n inversion\n four-fold\nasymmetric\nFigure 7: (colour online).

The dimensionless conductance follows from the Lan-\ndauer formula g = trt\u2020t [21]. Building up on the internal\ndynamics, we specify the scattering matrix as [39, 40]\nS = PT (1\u2212 FQ)\u22121FP, (42)\nwhere\nP =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n1N\u00d7N 0N\u00d7N\n0M\/2\u2212N\u00d7N 0M\/2\u2212N\u00d7N\n0N\u00d7N 1N\u00d7N\n0M\/2\u2212N\u00d7N 0M\/2\u2212N\u00d7N\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 (43)\nis a matrix of dimensionsM\u00d72N which projects onto the\nleads, while Q = 1 \u2212 PPT projects onto the hard walls\nwhere no leakage occurs. Equation (42) lifts the interpo-\nlation (41) of the internal dynamics to an interpolation\nbetween different scattering matrix ensembles.\nWhile the resulting expressions for the interpolated\nscattering matrix are quite similar to the stub model,\nour construction possesses some practical advantages. In\nparticular, the stub model has the deficit that symmetry\nis not broken for trajectories which avoid the stub (cor-\nresponding to a direct transfer from entrance to exit).\nTotal crossover in the stub model therefore can only be\nachieved in the limit M \u226b N . That this constraint does\nnot present itself in our procedure is convenient not only\nbecause M and N carry precise microscopic meaning,\nbut also because the ratioM\/2N = \u03c4D\/\u03c40 represents the\ndimensionless dwell time featuring in the semiclassical\ncrossover formulae. At the same time, our interpolation\nprocedure avoids the computational overhead which one\nwould encounter by basing the crossover on other mi-\ncroscopic schemes, such as the Pandey-Mehta class of\nHamiltonians [21].\nIn order to determine the physical meaning of the\nphenomenological parameter \u03bb we consider the universal\nlimit M \u226b N \u226b 1, in which a particle typically under-\ngoes many internal reflections before leaving the system.\nEach internal reflection probes the broken symmetry, so\nthat we expect that the crossover is essentially completed\nfor small values of \u03bb, on a crossover scale\n\u221a\n\u03c40\/2\u03c4D \u2243\n\u221a\nN\/M \u2261 \u03bbc (44)\nwhich scales with the inverse square-root of the dimen-\nsionless dwell time. Comparing this crossover acceler-\nation with the effect of a magnetic field in microscopic\nmodels (Ref. [21], as well as the semiclassical theory em-\nployed in the present paper) allows us to relate the inter-\npolation parameter \u03bb to the magnetic field through the\n16\nquantum dot,\n\u03bb = (B\/Bc)\u03bbc \u2243 B\/B0, (45)\nwhere we used Eq. (2). By construction, the crossover\nscale (44) also applies to interpolation between ensembles\nof different spatial symmetry.\nThe semiclassical considerations in this paper predict\nthat the crossover of the weak localization correction and\nthe conductance fluctuations obey a universal functional\ndependence on \u03bb\/\u03bbc for all types of symmetry breaking,\nwhich for M \u226b N (\u03bbc \u226a 1) can be written as\n\u03b4g(\u03bb) = \u03b4g(1) +\n\u03b4g(0)\u2212 \u03b4g(1)\n1 + (\u03bb\/\u03bbc)2\n, (46)\nvarg(\u03bb) = varg(1) +\nvarg(0)\u2212 varg(1)\n[1 + (\u03bb\/\u03bbc)2]2\n.

I.\nFigures 7, 8, and 9 compare these analytical predic-\ntions to the results of numerical computations for the\nmost important symmetry breaking scenarios. In each\nfigure, the data points are obtained from averaging over\n5000 realizations of the corresponding interpolation en-\nsemble. The internal matrix dimension M = 1000 and\nnumber of channels N = 50 translates into a critical\nvalue \u03bbc = 1\/\n\u221a\n20 of the interpolation parameter. The\nsolid curves show our analytical predictions, Eqs. (46)\nand (47). Figure 7 benchmarks the RMT model for the\nwell-studied effects of a magnetic field, demonstrating\nexcellent agreement with a Lorentzian crossover for the\nweak localization correction and a squared Lorentzian\ncrossover for the universal conductance fluctuations. Fig-\nure 8 presents results for breaking of internal symme-\ntries at vanishing magnetic field, while Fig. 9 shows\nthe same transitions for a finite magnetic field. For all\nsymmetry-breaking scenarios the numerical results of the\nphenomenological random-matrix model are in excellent\nagreement with the semiclassical predictions.\nX. TOWARDS EXPERIMENTAL\nOBSERVATION\nWe have investigated the effect of spatial symmetries\non transport through chaotic quantum dots, putting sig-\nnificant effort into studying how asymmetries cause a\ncrossover in the weak localization and universal con-\nductance fluctuations (from perfect spatial symmetry\nto completely broken symmetry). Understanding this\ncrossover is crucial for observing symmetry-induced ef-\nfects in experiments. Experimenters who believe that\ntheir systems are spatially symmetric can demonstrate it\nby confirming that the interference effects have the de-\nformation dependence that we predict. We are unaware\nof any experiments in which such symmetry effects have\nthus far been observed, so here we estimates the condi-\ntions under which such observations would be feasible.\nThe theory presented in this article is for electron\ntransport through quantum dots. Ultra-clean quantum\ndots are made by placing top gates on two-dimensional\nelectron gases (2DEGs), where typically the electron\u2019s\nwavelength \u03bbF \u223c 50nm [41]. To observe effects induced\nby a spatial symmetry, the dot\u2019s symmetry must be re-\nspected on a scale much less than 50nm. For example,\nif a typical electron bounces fifty times before escaping,\n\u03c4D\/\u03c40 = 50, then Eqs. (22,25) indicate that symmetry\ninduced effects will only be significant if imperfections in\nthe dot\u2019s boundary are on a scale \u03bbF\/\n\u221a\n50 \u223c 7nm. This is\na substantial experimental challenge, but it is not beyond\nthe realms of possibility.\nNote that we have neglected disorder throughout (al-\nthough it can be included without difficulty as another\nasymmetry). For quantum dots this is justifiable, due to\nthe remarkable progress in making clean 2DEGs which\nnow have mean-free paths between subsequent impurity\nscatterings of order of half a millimetre [41]. Consider a\ndot with 10 modes on each lead, meaning a lead width\nof 5\u03bbF \u2243 250nm, with \u03c4D\/\u03c40 = 50. Such a dot has\nL \u223c 2\u00b5m, so the typical distance travelled by an electron\nbetween entering and leaving the dot is vF\u03c4D \u223c 100\u00b5m.\nThe probability to escape without hitting an impurity\nis thus about 80%, so we can expect that disorder only\nreduces the effects discussed here by about 20%. If, in\ncontrast, one takes a dot with 5 modes on each lead and\n\u03c4D\/\u03c40 = 30 (then L \u223c 0.6\u00b5m), one finds a probability to\nescape without hitting an impurity as high as 96%.\nWhile our theory is for electrons in quantum dots, the\nresults are applicable to any waves in chaotic shaped\nsystems; microwaves in a cavity, ripples on water in a\ncontainer, vibrations of metal plates, etc. Turning to\nmicrowaves in chaotic-shaped cavities [42], we note that\nthe dimensionless conductances that we calculate in this\nwork can be interpreted as a measure of the microwave\npower transmitted from one lead to the other. Experi-\nmentally, the microwave wavelengths are typically a few\ncentimetres, so one only needs to make a cavity within a\nfew millimetres of perfectly symmetric to see a significant\neffect. This is easily attainable with conventional preci-\nsion engineering. However we note that our results are\nfor leads carrying many modes, when most experiments\nto-date on microwave cavities use single-mode leads. In\nthe single-mode case, the interference effects are signifi-\ncantly more complicated than those described here.\nXI. CONCLUSIONS\nBy working with a microscopic theory (rather than\nthe essentially phenomenological RMT) we are not only\nable to extract the form of the symmetric\/asymmetric\ncrossover, we are also able to say how the crossover pa-\nrameter \u03b3asym depends on the nature of the deformation\nof the dot. Such knowledge is crucial in determining if\n17\nan experimental system is close to being spatially sym-\nmetric. We find a remarkable wide variation in this de-\npendence, which for global deformations takes the form\nof Eq. (22) while for local deformations it is given by\nEq. (26). We hope that the semiclassical method de-\nveloped here will lead to an improved understanding of\nsituations where RMT is hard to apply, such as systems\nwith a mixed phase space for which at present only phe-\nnomenological descriptions are available.\nIn the second of this pair of articles [32], we turn to\nthe problem of a spatially symmetric dot coupled to leads\nwhich do not respect the symmetry.\nXII. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nRW thanks P. Brouwer, P. Marconcini and M. Macucci\nfor interesting and useful discussions. RW and HS are\ngrateful for the hospitality of the Banff International Re-\nsearch Station, where this work was initiated.\nAppendix A: GENERALIZED TIME-REVERSAL\nSYMMETRY\nThe concept of a generalized time-reversal symmetry\nis frequently used in the RMT analysis of spatially sym-\nmetric systems [43]. We do not explicitly use this con-\ncept in our semiclassical calculations but here discuss it\nbriefly because it informs the construction of the RMT\nensembles listed in Table II.\nA spatially symmetric system which is not symmetric\nunder the standard (momentum-reversing) time-reversal\nsymmetry (such as one with a magnetic field B \u226b Bc)\nmay still be invariant under the combination of time-\nreversal and a spatial symmetry. To see this one should\nnote two things; firstly, all quantum systems are sym-\nmetric under time-reversal if one also changes the sign of\nthe external magnetic field; secondly, mirror symmetries\n(up-down or left-right symmetry) map a system onto it-\nself with the opposite sign for the external (perpendicu-\nlar) magnetic field. Thus one immediately sees that an\nup-down symmetric system will be invariant under the\ncombination of time-reversal and mirror symmetry; this\nis an example of a generalized time-reversal symmetry.\nCombining this with the fact that odd (even) transverse\nlead modes couple only to odd (even) internal states in\nthe dot [22], we obtain the RMT ensembles for up-down\nsymmetry in Table II \u2014 odd (even) dot states being those\nthat do (do not) change sign under the up-down map-\nping. In particular, the generalized time-reversal sym-\nmetry manifests itself in the fact that the ensemble is\ngiven by combinations of COE matrices for all magnetic\nfields, even for B \u226b Bc where one might naively expect\nCUE matrices.\nThe case of a left-right symmetry is a little more in-\nvolved because acting with the left-right mirror symme-\ntry not only changes the sign of the (perpendicular) mag-\nnetic field but also interchanges the leads. Thus the gen-\neralized time-reversal symmetry here is a combination of\ntime-reversal symmetry, the left-right symmetry, and the\nre-labelling of the leads (L\u2194 R) To obtain the ensembles\nin Table II, one combines this with the fact that all L lead\nmodes couple equally to even and odd dot states, while\nall R modes have positive coupling to even dot states and\nnegative coupling to odd states. However, once again the\npresence of the generalized time-reversal symmetry man-\nifests itself in the fact that the ensemble is given by COE\nmatrices even when B \u226b Bc (see Table II).\nIn the case of an inversion symmetry, there is no gen-\neralized time-reversal symmetry, and thus the ensemble\nswitches from COE matrices for B \u226a Bc to CUE matri-\nces for B \u226b Bc (see Table II). The reason for the absence\nof a generalized time-reversal symmetry is that the inver-\nsion symmetry mapping does not change the sign of the\nmagnetic field. Thus for B \u226b Bc, one cannot construct\nan invariance out of the time-reversal and inversion sym-\nmetries.\nHaving outlined the concept of generalized time-\nreversal symmetries, one sees that they are most natural\nin the abstract space used for RMT.
