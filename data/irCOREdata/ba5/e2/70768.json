Appendix 1 The classification of self-repairs Name of repair  Definition  Example Different information (D-) repair The  speaker  decides  to  encode  different information  from  the  one  he\/she  is  currently formulating (Levelt, 1983) Inappropriate information (DI-) repair  The  speaker  repairs  the  message  because  its information content is faulty (Levelt, 1983) The room is er uhm eer thirty thirty thousand er too much er ten thousand er forint er forints per day Ordering error (DO-) repair  The decides to encode parts of the intended message in different order (Levelt, 1983) Well, we it's it's about a thousand Forints Retrospection: First I wanted to answer the second question, but then I realized that I should answer the first question first. Message abandonment (DM-) repair The  speaker  abandons  the  originally  intended message and replaces it with a different one we have some er er v... maybe you have vegetarians in your group Retrospection:  Here  the  idea  of  vegetarians suddenly popped up, and I abandoned what I was going to say because I would not have been able to list any more types of food anyway. Appropriacy (A-) repair The  speaker  decides  to  encode  the  original information in a modified way (Levelt, 1983). Appropriate level of information (AL-) repair The speaker decides to further specify the original message (Levelt, 1983). There are very wide choice of er main courses er er steak er er several kind of steak Retrospection:  I wanted to say it more  precisely that we do not only have one kind of steak  but several kinds of steak. Ambiguous reference (AA-) repair The speaker repairs the referring expression because of ambiguity (Levelt, 1983). And you have to pay extra for the drinks. Then you have  to  negotiate  that  and  talk  about  the  drinks with the barman.","cites":null},{"id":16387477,"title":"Aspects of classroom treatment: Toward a more comprehensive view of second language education.

The \nfindings suggest that in an information exchange task formally instructed L2 speakers pay \napproximately equal attention to the appropriacy and adequacy of the information they provide \nas to the accuracy of their utterance. The results indicate that the amount of attention paid to the \nlinguistic form of the utterance does not vary at different stages of L2 competence and that the \ndistribution of attention in monitoring for errors is markedly different in L1 and L2. In the case \nof advanced L2 speakers, the extra attentional resources made available by the automaticity of \ncertain encoding processes were used for checking the discourse level aspects of their message. \n \n  \n The role of attention in second language acquisition is an issue that has received \ndistinguished attention recently. In a series of studies Schmidt (1990, 1993, 1994; Schmidt & \nFrota, 1986) claimed that conscious attention to input (noticing in his terminology) is necessary \nfor learning to take place. Robinson (1995) refined the conditions that are essential for \nacquisition by asserting that input will become intake if the detection of input is followed by \nrehearsal in short-term memory. VanPatten (1990, 1994, 1996; VanPatten & Cadiorno, 1993) \nconducted a number of experiments in which he examined how attention is divided between \nform and content in input processing. \n It is well-known from earlier studies on attention that due to short-term memory (or in \nrecent terminology working memory (Gathercole & Baddeley, 1994)) constraints, attentional \nresources are limited (Broadbent, 1958, cf. Robinson, 1995). These limitations play an essential \nrole in L2 speech processing, as its mechanisms are only partially automatic and require \nconscious control, that is, attention (deBot, 1992). How L2 speakers manage their attentional \nresources influences their performance, consequently the investigation of this phenomenon is of \ncrucial importance not only in SLA but also in L2 production research. Therefore, an increasing \nnumber of studies have been conducted on the allocation of attention under various constraints \nand conditions in L2 production. In her pioneering work Tarone (1983) and in a later study \nTarone and Parrish (1988) analyzed the accuracy of L2 speakers\u2019 performance in tasks that \nrequired varying amount of attention to be paid to linguistic form and meaning. The results of \nthese studies indicated that the availability of attention influences the accuracy of learners\u2019 \noutput. The findings of another related research project showed that the discourse salience of a \nlinguistic form also affects how much attention is paid to its correct production (Tarone, 1985). \nResearchers investigating the production mechanisms involved in task-based language learning \nhave examined how task characteristics (Foster & Skehan, 1996; Skehan & Foster, 1996), \nplanning conditions (Foster & Skehan, 1996; Skehan & Foster, 1996) and task repetition \n(Bygate, 1996) affect whether L2 learners devote more attention to form or to the meaning \nconveyed. \n The role of attention in speech monitoring, however, has been a neglected area of \ninvestigation despite the fact that the issue of the frequency of certain types of self-corrections \nhas been one of the most widely explored aspects of the self-repair behavior of L2 speakers. \nMost studies in this field were only concerned with establishing the distribution of various types \nof self-repairs, and did not attribute high importance to the discussion of the allocation of \nattention. These studies have only used raw percentages of occurrence rather than standardized \nfrequency data (e.g. Fathman, 1980; Lennon, 1984; van Hest, 1996) to investigate what type of \nerrors L2 speakers\u2019 monitor is sensitive to. Thus, the results obtained by calculating only the \nproportion of various self-repairs might provide a different view about the allocation of attention \nthan results that also take the actual frequency of self-corrections into consideration. In addition, \nthe lack of standardized frequency data in previous studies did not allow for the use of \nparametric statistical procedures either. Another shortcoming of the research in this field has \nbeen that with the exception of Poulisse\u2019s (1993) and Green and Hecht\u2019s (1994) projects, \nconclusions concerning the monitoring skills of L2 learners were drawn without the examination \nof the frequency and the correction rate of errors and their relationship to the frequency of self-\nrepairs. Despite these problematic issues of research methodology, researchers of L2 production \nassumed that that L2 learners pay considerably more attention to lexical appropriacy than to \ngrammatical accuracy (e.g. Fathman, 1980; Lennon, 1984; Poulisse, 1993; Poulisse & \nBongaerts, 1994; van Hest, 1996). Studies on the correction rate of different types of errors in L1 \nproduction, however, showed that the proportion of corrected phonological errors exceeds that of \ncorrected lexical errors (Levelt, 1983; Nooteboom, 1980). Investigations concerning L2 self-\nrepairs also revealed that the frequency of repairs concerning the information content of the \nmessage varies across different types of tasks (Poulisse 1993; van Hest, 1996). The only large \nscale research project to date which examined the effect of proficiency on the allocation of \nattention in monitoring was carried out by van Hest (1996). In line with earlier small scale \nstudies (e.g. O\u2019Connor, 1988) she found that with the development of L2 competence, L2 \nspeakers\u2019 monitor becomes more sensitive to discourse level problems than to lower level \nstructural errors (for a comprehensive overview of self-repair research see Kormos, 1999). \n The participants of most of the studies conducted in this field to date were either L2 \nlearners in an environment where the language to be acquired was the official language of the \ncountry (e.g. Fathman, 1980; Lennon, 1984) or Dutch learners of English (e.g. Poulisse, 1993; \nvan Hest, 1996). The implications of the effect of the nature of acquisition (i.e. instructed vs. \nnatural) and that of the type of instruction the participants received on self-repair behavior (i.e. \nform focussed vs. communication focussed) have not been investigated yet. Although one of the \nmost carefully conducted comparative method studies (Allen, Swain, Harley & Cummins, 1990) \ndid not find significant differences between communicative and form focussed classes, it can be \nassumed that the method of teaching will influence how much importance L2 learners attribute \nto linguistic accuracy. In his overview of studies on the effect of formal instruction on \ngrammatical accuracy, Ellis (1994) concluded that if formal instruction is provided at the \nappropriate stage of the learners' L2 development, it results in improved accuracy. In this case \nimprovement in linguistic accuracy should also entail increased attention paid to grammatically \naccurate language production. \n As can be seen, therefore, it remains a controversial issue how attention is allocated in L2 \nspeech monitoring, and very little is known about the underlying psycholinguistic, pedagogical \nand developmental aspects of the findings obtained in previous studies. Thus, the aim of the \npresent study has been to examine how L2 speakers at various levels of competence, who \nreceived mixed communicative and form focussed instruction, manage their attentional \nresources in monitoring for grammatical and lexical accuracy, the informational content of their \nmessage, and the textual features of their utterance. The study addressed the following research \nquestions: \n1. How do L2 learners allocate their attention for monitoring their speech in an \ninformation gap task? \n2. How does the division of attention for speech monitoring vary at various levels of L2 \ncompetence and in comparison with L1 speech production in an information gap \ntask? \nIn order to gain a more precise view of the phenomena under investigation, a variety of \nperformance variables related to self-correction were analyzed, and a retrospective interview was \nconducted with the participants. For obtaining baseline data on how attention is divided when \nmonitoring L1 speech, data from a group of L1 speakers were also collected. The paper will first \noutline how attention is conceived of in the present study. This will be followed by the \ndescription of the research project and the presentation of the results obtained. Next the findings \nof the study are discussed with reference to psycholinguistic models of speech processing. In the \nconclusion I will point out several unresolved issues that emerged from the present research \nproject and suggest directions for further research. \n \nThe conceptualization of attention in the study \n \n Tomlin and Villa (1994) pointed out that attention has three functions, and consequently \ncan be understood as alertness, orientation and detection. They defined alertness as \u201cgeneral \nreadiness to deal with incoming stimuli or data\u201c (p. 190). The orienting function of attention \ntakes care of the allocation of resources based on the expectations concerning the information to \nbe processed. Upon detection, attention is focused on specific units of information. As \nmonitoring involves the noticing of errors and inappropriacies, in the present paper I will be \nconcerned with the detection function of attention. \n Upon the discussion of my findings, Kahneman\u2019s (1973) and Wickens\u2019 (1989) models of \nattention will be adopted because these two theories provide sufficient theoretical background \nconcerning the voluntary control and the competition of attentional resources. In these theories \nthe allocation of attention is determined by two forces: conscious decisions based on the \ndemands of the task to be performed and enduring pre-dispositions, both of which are of great \nimportance in L2 speech monitoring. Wickens (1989) argued that performance on concurrent \ntasks deteriorates if both tasks draw on the same pool of attentional resources (for example \nmaintaining two parallel conversations). Upon processing their speech, L2 learners need to rely \non the same verbal resource pool, therefore the various phases of speech production need to \ncompete with each other for attentional resources. \n  \n \nMethod \n \nParticipants and settings \n \n The participants of the study were 40 native speakers of Hungarian. 10 participants spoke \nEnglish at an intermediate level and attended an exam preparation course in a language school. \nTheir age ranged between 16 and 22. 10 students, who were participants of an evening course at \nE\u00f6tv\u00f6s University, Budapest, were upper-intermediate learners. They were between 25 and 35 \nyears old. 10 students\u2019 level of proficiency was advanced, and they studied English as day-\nstudents at E\u00f6tv\u00f6s University. These participants were 19-22 years old. Another 10 university \nstudents in the same year of studies and of the same age as the previous group solved the task in \nHungarian. All participants were speakers of Standard Hungarian. \nThe intermediate learners had been studying English for at least 4 years when the study \nwas completed. The upper-intermediate participants received about 5-6 years of instruction, and \nthe advanced learners had been learning the language for 6-8 years, but none of them had spent \nmore than 4 months in an English speaking country. This means that the learners were attending \ntwo different schools at the time of the study, but they had also studied at various other \ninstitutions (e.g. language schools, secondary school) for 2-6 years. The method of instruction \nboth at E\u00f6tv\u00f6s University and at the language school follows a mixed form focussed and \ncommunicative syllabus. At present in Hungary, both in secondary schools and in language \nschools the use of a mixed communicative and form focussed syllabuses is typical with slightly \nmore emphasis being placed on form than on communication (Enyedy & Medgyes, 1998; \nNikolov, 1999). Therefore it can be presumed that the participants' instructional background was \nsimilar. \n A C-test, which had been validated by D\u00f6rnyei and Katona (1992) was administered to \nall the participants to measure their level of proficiency. The C-test contained three texts with 21 \ngaps each. The participants of the study who scored higher than 54 points out of 63 were \nclassified as advanced speakers (above 54 points out of 63) (Group 3). Students with scores \nbetween 53 and 41 points were considered upper-intermediate speakers (Group 2), and learners \nwith scores below 40 points pre-intermediate speakers (Group 1). The level of proficiency of the \nthree groups was found to be significantly different from each other (F (2, 27) = 130.45, p < \n0.001) (see Table 1). \n------------------------------- \nInsert Table 1 around here \n------------------------------- \nFollowing the administration of the C-test, the participants were interviewed one by one. \nFirst, they were asked to act out an approximately 5 minute-long information gap type role-play \nactivity adapted from Jones (1991, p. 218) with me being the interlocutor. The participants had \nto assume the role of the manager of a restaurant, who was to answer an enquiry concerning a \nprivate room in the restaurant. I played the role of the customer. Instructions and the necessary \nbackground information were provided in the native language of the participants. The task was \ndesigned in a way that it would reflect real life interaction. Its aim was to ensure genuine \nexchange of information, and to elicit the maximum possible amount of speech from the students \nwhile keeping my input to the minimum. The task could be divided into four distinct phases. \nFirst, the participants were requested to provide information on the conditions of hiring a private \nroom. Next, the participant and me had to reach a compromise, as the customer (played by me) \nwanted to hire the room for a fewer number of people than specified in the conditions of the \nrestaurant. Thirdly, I asked the participant to recommend some dishes from the menu, and \nfinally, to describe the private room. These two questions were unexpected to the students as no \ninformation concerning these topics was provided on the information sheet. This task involved \nunpredictable interaction and considering new information, which seemed to place heavy \ncognitive load on the participants. Consequently, it was assumed that participants in the research \nwould focus on meaning rather than on form, which would ensure the modeling of real life \ninteractions.  \n The retrospective interview was conducted on the basis of the guidelines set up by \nEricsson and Simon (1980, 1993) to ensure the reliability of the data gained in this way. They \nsuggested that participants should be asked to comment on their performance immediately after \nthe completion of the task, when the memory traces of the thought sequences are still fresh. In \norder to activate the greatest possible amount of information stored in the long-term memory in \nconnection with the task, the participants should be provided with contextual information, that is, \nwith the context in which the particular utterance was made. Contextual information also helps \navoid that participants confound previous solutions to a certain problem with the solutions \nemployed at the time of the completion of the task. All the information that the experimenter \nasks for should be directly retrievable, that is, it needs to be of the type of thought sequence that \nwas heeded upon task performance. Therefore, only conscious, controlled cognitive processes \ncan be reported. If this criterion is flawed, the participants will be induced to inference and \ngeneralize in the retrospective report. In order to avoid this, Ericsson and Simon (1980, 1993) \nsuggest that the information requested from the participants should relate to specific problems or \nspecific information. The researchers should refrain from asking leading questions so as to \nminimize the effects of \u2018researcher bias\u2019. Finally, Ericsson and Simon argue that participants \nshould not be informed of the subsequent retrospective interview before the completion of the \ntask, otherwise this might affect their performance. \n The retrospective interview in the present project was partly controlled as participants \nwere asked to comment on specific aspects of their performance only, but the information they \ncould provide was not predetermined. The recall of relevant information was aided by asking \nstudents to verbalize their thoughts upon listening to their speech on a tape recorder. The \nretrospective report was to a certain degree self-initiated because the participants were requested \nto stop the tape when they found instances of breakdowns or self-repairs and comment on them. \nNevertheless, I also asked questions if the students failed to reflect upon relevant hesitation \nphenomena or instances of self-correction. Due to the fact that I did not inform the participants \nthat they would need to comment on their performance before carrying out the task, the request \nto provide retrospective comments was not supposed to influence task performance. \n The performance of the task and the subsequent retrospective interview were both video- \nand audio-recorded. The transcriptions of the tasks were done by trained transcribers, and I \nchecked the transcriptions and transcribed the retrospective interviews. \n \nAnalysis \n \n With the help of the retrospective comments, a psycholinguistic system of classification \nof the self-repairs found in the corpus was devised on the basis of previous taxonomies of self-\ncorrections (Br\u00e9dart, 1991; Levelt, 1983) (for a detailed discussion of the taxonomy see Kormos, \n1998, 1999). In the study four major groups of self-repairs: different- information, appropriacy, \nerror and rephrasing repairs were distinguished. Here only the major types of self-repairs will \nbe defined; the other sub-types and examples are listed in Appendix 1. \n In the case of different-information (D-) repair, the speaker decides to encode different \ninformation than he\/she is currently formulating (Levelt, 1983) (Example 1).  \n(1) and if you I mean it\u2019s going to be quite dark at that time \nRetrospection: Here I could not finish the sentence. I wanted to say something like if you \nwant a different type of lighting, but I realized that I would not be able to express this \nquickly enough, and it was not that important anyway, so I rather went on to say \nsomething else. \n \nAppropriacy (A-) repairs are employed when the speaker decides to encode the originally intended \ninformation but in a modified way (Levelt, 1983) (Example 2). Speakers resort to A-repairs when \nthey have encoded inaccurate, ambiguous information that needs to be further specified, or if they \nhave used either incoherent terminology (Levelt, 1983) or pragmatically inappropriate language \n(Br\u00e9dart, 1991). Another type of A-repair includes the correction of utterances that the speaker \njudges to be not sophisticated enough (based on Br\u00e9dart, 1991). \n (2) there are very wide choice of er main courses er er steak er er several kind of steak \nRetrospection: I wanted to say it more precisely that we do not only have one kind of \nsteak but several kinds of steak. \n \n In the case of error repairs, speakers repair an accidental lapse (Levelt, 1983). Such lapses \ncan occur at every phase of speech processing, that is, during accessing words, grammatical and \nphonological encoding, and articulation (for a detailed review of mechanisms of speech processing \nsee Levelt, 1989; Levelt, Roelofs & Meyer, 1999). Repairs of lapses occurring at these different \nstages are called lexical (3), grammatical (4), and phonological error repairs (4) respectively.  \n(3) will er have to pay er five er sorry er twenty-five percent \nRetrospection: Here I said \u201cfive\u201d instead of \u201ctwenty-five\u201d accidentally. \n(4) the tables er is er are round in the hall. \nRetrospection: I noticed that I made a mistake. \n(5) scu [sku:] soups \n \nThe fourth main type of repair, rephrasing repair involves the revision of the form of the \nspeaker\u2019s original message without changing its content. In this case the speaker repeats a \nslightly modified version of a word or phrase by adding something and\/or using paraphrase \nbecause of uncertainty about its correctness, but tries to convey the same original message. \nRephrasing repair is different from error repair in that error repairs merely involve the correction \nof accidental lapses, and, consequently, the issuing of the same pre-verbal plan in an unmodified \nform, whereas rephrasing repairs are signs of lack of L2 competence (6). \n(6) uhm our fish fish meals er foods are very good too \nRetrospection: I corrected \u201cfish meals\u201d for \u201cfish food\u201d because I was not sure you can \nsay \u201cfish meals\u201d and \u201cfish foods\u201d sounded a bit better. \n \n For the analysis of errors, Lennon\u2019s (1991) definition of errors was used. In this \ndefinition an error is \u201ca linguistic form or combination of forms, which in the same context and \nunder similar conditions of production, would in all likelihood, not be produced by the speakers\u2019 \nnative speaker counterparts\u201d (p. 182). On the basis of this definition, I identified all the possible \ninstances of errors in the transcripts of the 40 participants. As my native language is Hungarian, \nin the Hungarian transcripts I identified all the errors alone. In the English transcripts all the \ncases where no unambiguous judgments could be made were collected and were shown to two \n(an American and a British) educated native speaker judges. In a 25-40 minute long interview, \nwhich I conducted separately with the two judges, the native speakers were informed about the \ntask the students had to perform and were shown the errors together with their contexts. They \nwere asked to decide whether they would produce the specific utterance in the given context. \nOnly the cases that both of the judges considered unacceptable were counted as errors.  \n After the identification of errors, all the instances of erroneous utterances were classified \nas either grammatical or lexical errors. In the present project, errors of lexis and grammar were \nstudied from a psycholinguistic perspective, which means that errors were not classified on the \nbasis their formal features, but according to where the error occurred in the psycholinguistic \nprocess of encoding the message. In order to obtain comparable results with the distribution of \nself-corrections, erroneous utterances were classified similarly to grammatical and lexical error \nrepairs. Grammatical errors were defined as inaccuracies that are the results of faulty \ngrammatical encoding processes, whereas lexical errors were assumed to be caused by \ninappropriate lexical access (for the sub-types and examples of errors see Appendix 2).  \nGrammatical-error correction rate was calculated by dividing the number of \ngrammatical-error repairs by the number of grammatical errors. As all the rephrasing repairs in \nthe study involved specifying lexical entries, lexical-error correction rate was established by \ndividing the total number of rephrasing and lexical-error repairs by the number of lexical errors.  \n In order to ensure the reliability of the classification of repairs, a fellow researcher was \nasked to code a sample of 100 self-repairs. The fellow researcher was also provided with the \nretrospective comments concerning each self-repair. Agreement between the two codings was \nvery high (r (98) = 0.93). All the data obtained as a result of the various analystical procedures \nwere computer coded and processed by the SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) \nprogram. \n \nResults \n \n Error repairs constituted the highest percentage of L2 self-corrections (38.7%), and L2 \nspeakers made appropriacy (22.8%) and different-information repairs (21.8%) in approximately \nequal proportion (see Table 2). Rephrasing repairs constituted 15.2% of the L2 self-repair \ncorpus. In L1 speech appropriacy repairs were the most frequent (57.1%), and D-repairs (22.4%) \nalso outnumbered E-repairs (20.4%). R-repairs did not occur in L1 production.  \n----------------------------- \nInsert Table 2 around here \n----------------------------- \n \n Within the class of L2 error repairs, grammatical repairs were the most frequent ones \n(16.9% of all the repairs), which were closely followed by lexical-error repairs (14.2% of all the \nrepairs) (see Table 3). Nevertheless, if we consider that all the rephrasing repairs were concerned \nwith the correction of a lexical item as well, the proportion of lexical and rephrasing repairs in \nthe corpus (29.4%) exceeds that of the grammatical-error repairs. Interestingly in L1 speech \nlexical error repairs constituted exactly the same proportion of the repairs as in L2 (14.2%), \nwhereas phonological-error repairs (4.1%) outnumbered grammatical-error repairs (2.1%). \n As can be seen in Table 3, within the class of appropriacy repairs, appropriate level of \ninformation repairs occurred in the highest proportion (L2 -15.2%; L1 - 24.5%) both in L1 and \nL2. Repairs of ambiguous reference (L2 -1%; L1 - 2.1%) and coherent terminology (L2-0.7%; \nL1 - 0%) were rare in both languages. In L2 both pragmatic-appropriacy (AP) repairs (3.8%) and \nrepairs for good language (AG) (repairs correcting the linguistic sophistication of the utterance) \n(2.8%) constituted a smaller proportion of the repairs than in L1 (AP - 12.2%; AG-18.3%). \n Among different-information repairs, corrections concerning the order in which the \ninformation was provided were rare both in L1 and L2 (L2- 1%, L1 - 2.1%). The participants \ngave up their original message more often in L2 (14.9%) than in L1 (6.1%), whereas false \ninformation was corrected in higher proportion in L1 (14.2%) than in L2 (5.9%) (see Table 3). \n \n----------------------------- \nInsert Table 3 around here \n----------------------------- \nThe effect of proficiency on the frequency of self-repairs was examined with a \nMANOVA (multiple analysis of variance) analysis, in which proficiency was the independent \nvariable and the frequencies of the different types of self-repairs were the dependent variables. \nThe MANOVA revealed a significant main effect for proficiency (F (3, 36) = 2.21, p< 0.01). \nThe univariate F-tests showed significant proficiency effects in the case of self-repairs which \ninvolve the correction of erroneous output, repairs for good language, and the global frequency \nof self-repairs (see Table 4). Findings in this study were considered significant at the p < 0.05 \nlevel. The consecutive Scheffe-test showed that in L1 speech self-repairs were significantly less \nfrequent than in the output of pre-intermediate and upper-intermediate learners (F (3, 36) = 5.02, \np < 0.01). It was also found that pre-intermediate speakers made significantly more lexical- (F \n(3, 36)= 5.17, p < 0.01) and grammatical-error repairs (F (3, 36) = 6.37, p < 0.01) than advanced \nand L1 speakers did. Identical results were obtained when the categories of lexical-error repairs \nand rephrasing repairs were collapsed (F (3, 36) = 6.73, p < 0.01). Despite the fact that the \nfrequency of phonological-error repairs did not differ significantly across the four groups of \nparticipants, the frequency of error repairs in the pre-intermediate learners\u2019 speech was \nsignificantly higher than the frequency of error repairs in the advanced and L1 group (F (3, 36) = \n9.93, p < 0.001). Upper-intermediate speakers did not differ from any of the other groups in this \nrespect. As regards repairs for good language, the Scheffe procedure showed that L1 speakers \nproduce more repairs for good language than both pre-intermediate and upper-intermediate \nspeakers (F (3, 36) = 6.71, p < 0.01). In the case of the other types of self-repairs the one-way \nanalysis of variance did not yield significant results at the p < 0.05 level (see Table 4). \n----------------------------- \nInsert Table 4 around here \n----------------------------- \n \n The correlational analyses conducted with the L2 data confirmed the results of the one-\nway analysis of variance. In this analysis the proficiency-test scores of the participants were \ncorrelated with the frequency of the various types of self-repairs. The findings showed that the \nhigher the participants scored at the proficiency test, the fewer lexical-error repairs (r (28) = -\n0.56, p < 0.01) and grammatical-error repairs (r (28) = -0.54, p < 0.01), and general error repairs \n(r (28) = - 0.43, p < 0.05) could be found in their speech. Unlike the one-way analysis of \nvariance, the correlational analysis of the frequency of appropriacy repairs and the proficiency \ntest scores indicated that the more proficient participants were, the more frequently they repaired \nthe appropriacy of the information content of their message (appropriacy repairs) (r (28) = 0.36, \np < 0.05). \n In order to be able to make inferences concerning the sensitivity of the monitor towards \nerrors in L2 production, it is not enough to investigate the frequency of self-repairs, the \ncorrection rate of lexical and grammatical errors also needs to be analyzed. Lexical errors \noccurred with a frequency of 4.27 per 100 words and grammatical errors with a frequency of \n3.25 per 100 words in the L2 corpus. Participants made lexical errors with a frequency of 0.23 \nper 100 words and grammatical errors with 0.09 per 100 words in L1. As can be seen in Table 5, \nthe correction rate of lexical errors in L2 speech was 20.61% and that of grammatical errors \n15.31%. The paired sampled t-test did not show any significant difference between the \ncorrection rate of these two types of errors in L2 (t (29) = 1.41, p = 0.169). 75.00% of L1 lexical \nerrors and 33.33% of grammatical errors were corrected. No paired sample t-tests could be \ncarried out concerning L1 error-correction rate because of the few number of participants in \nwhose speech lexical-error repairs and grammatical-error repairs could be found simultaneously. \n----------------------------- \nInsert Table 5 around here \n----------------------------- \n \n The effect of proficiency on the correction rate of errors was also investigated by means \nof MANOVA. The MANOVA procedure revealed a significant proficiency effect (F (3, 33) = \n4.15, p< 0.01). The univariate F-tests showed that the level of proficiency influences lexical \ncorrection rate as well as the total error correction rate. The Scheffe-test did not reveal any \ndifferences between the L2 groups, but it indicated that L1 speakers correct a significantly \nhigher proportion of lexical errors (F (3, 31) = 9.48, p < 0.001) and errors in general (F (3, 33) = \n7.03, p < 0.01) than all the groups at various levels of L2 proficiency (see Table 6). No such \ndifference could be found in the case of grammatical-error correction rate (F (3, 29) = 0.89, p = \n0.45). The correlational analysis of the correction rate of errors and the proficiency test scores in \nL2 production did not show any significant relationship between the proportion of corrected \nlexical errors (r (28) = -0.04, p = 0.83), grammatical errors (r (28) =  -0.19, p = 0.32) and errors \nin general (r (28) = -0.09, p = 0.62) and the level of L2 competence. \n \n----------------------------- \nInsert Table 6 around here \n----------------------------- \nDiscussion \n \n The results of the statistical analyses showed that in L2 speech error repairs were more \nfrequent and constituted a higher proportion of the total number of repairs than in L1. On the \nother hand, L1 speakers corrected the informational content of their message more frequently \nthan L2 learners. The findings also suggested that lexical errors were repaired considerably more \nfrequently than grammatical errors both in L1 and L2. The comparison of the frequency of the \nvarious types of self-repairs revealed that the self-repair behavior of advanced L2 learners and \nL1 speakers was very similar. Participants at a high level L2 proficiency corrected linguistic \nerrors significantly less frequently than learners at the pre-intermediate level. In addition, \nadvanced speakers repaired the appropriacy of the informational content more frequently than \npre-intermediate students did. The analysis of the correction rate of lexical and grammatical \nerrors, however, indicated that L1 speakers corrected a considerably higher proportion of their \nerrors than L2 learners at any of the three proficiency levels investigated in this study. L1 and L2 \nspeakers also differed in that L2 learners corrected a similar proportion of their lexical and \ngrammatical errors, whereas L1 speakers corrected almost twice as many of their lexical errors \nthan their grammatical errors. \nThe comparison of the distribution of different types of self-repairs with previous studies \nseems to be problematic for several reasons. As opposed to other studies in this field, in the \npresent research project covert repairs were not investigated due to issues of reliability. The \nexistence of covert repairs can only be inferred from lexical hesitation devices and long pauses \n(Postma & Kolk, 1993), and as a result, the establishment of the actual occurrence of a covert \nrepair is rather problematic even with the help of retrospection. The unambiguous identification \nof a phenomenon is a pre-condition for any systematic analysis; therefore in this study covert \nrepairs were not studied. In addition, the task used in the present study also differed from the \ntasks given to participants in earlier research, as previous projects used picture description (van \nHest, 1996), spatial description (Levelt, 1983; Verhoeven, 1989) guided or non-guided interview \ntasks (Fathman, 1980; van Hest, 1996) and storytelling (Fathman, 1980; Lennon, 1990; van \nHest, 1996; Verhoeven, 1989). Information gap activities had not been used in this field before. \nStudies in the field of task-based learning (Foster & Skehan, 1996; Skehan & Foster, 1996) and \nvan Hest's research (1996), in which three different types of tasks were administered, showed \nthat the frequency and proportion of self-repairs differs across various types of tasks. For these \nreasons, the comparison of our findings with earlier research can only be tentative. \n The distribution of the repairs supports the assumptions of previous studies that, similarly \nto L1 speakers, L2 learners also pay particular attention to correct lexical choice (e.g. Fathman, \n1980; Lennon, 1984; Poulisse, 1993; Poulisse & Bongaerts, 1994; van Hest, 1996), which is \nreflected in the high number of lexical repairs in L2. The fact that in the present study, \ngrammatical-error corrections outnumbered lexical-error corrections is due to the invention of \nthe category of rephrasing repairs. As proven by the detailed analysis, this type of self-correction \nin the corpus only involved rephrasing a lexical entry about the correctness of which the speaker \nwas uncertain, thus, similarly to lexical-error repairs, its aim was also to repair lexical choice. \nConsequently, if the number of lexical-error and rephrasing repairs is added up, the hypothesis \nthat corrections concerning lexical errors outnumber any other type of error repairs gains \nsupport. Previous studies explained this finding by assuming that the speakers\u2019 monitor is \nparticularly sensitive to the correctness of lexical entries for two reasons. On the one hand, they \ncarry the most information in the message, and on the other hand, making an error in this phase \nof speech processing can result in serious problems of misunderstanding (Poulisse & Bongaerts, \n1994; van Hest, 1996). If, however, the number of errors and the rate of their correction is also \ninvestigated, the increased sensitivity of the monitor towards lexical errors in L2 speech does not \nseem to be supported (see below). \n If one adds up the number of appropriacy and different-information repairs, it can also be \nseen that in interactions where the focus is on the adequate exchange of information, that is, in \nthe information gap type of task used in the study, both L1 and L2 speakers pay particular \nattention to the quality and quantity of the information conveyed. The fact that 44.6% of all the \nself-repairs in L2 were concerned with the content of the message suggests that the participants' \nattention was approximately equally divided between monitoring for the appropriacy and \nadequacy of the informational content and the linguistic accuracy of the utterance in L2. \nInterestingly, in this type of task L1 speakers devoted more attention to information content than \nL2 learners did, as in the corpus of L1 self-repairs, all together 79.4% of the corrections were \nconcerned with informational content. This finding supports van Hest\u2019s (1996) results, who \nfound that L1 speakers pay more attention to the information they convey than to linguistic \naccuracy. \n The comparison of the results concerning the correction rate of errors in L2 with the L1 \ndata also has interesting implications. Nooteboom (1980), who analyzed Meringer\u2019s (1908) \ncorpus of speech errors, found that 53% of the erroneously selected words were corrected by the \nspeakers. In Levelt\u2019s (1983) study, which involved the description of colored visual patterns, \n46% of the incorrect color names were repaired. This seems to confirm that L1 speakers repair \nevery second lexical error on average. The only previous project that investigated the correction \nrate of slips of the tongue both in L1 and L2 production was carried out by Poulisse (1993). She \nfound that L2 speakers corrected a higher proportion of their performance lapses than L1 \nspeakers. Poulisse explained these results by arguing that L2 learners are more focussed on \ncorrectness than L1 speakers. It has to be noted that Poulisse's study only involved the analysis \nof assumed performance slips and not those of errors in general. This might account for the \ndifferences between the findings of the present research and her work. The results of my study \nsuggest that in general L2 learners were able to filter out about the third of the errors that L1 \nspeakers were able to notice. The proportion of corrected lexical and grammatical errors was \nhigher in L1 than in L2, although in the case of grammatical-error correction rate the difference \nwas not statistically significant. This suggests that monitoring for errors is generally more \nefficient in L1 than in L2. \nIf one examines the psycholinguistic processes underlying the correction rate of lexical \nand grammatical errors, the results of the present project concerning L2 speech differ from the \nfindings of previous L2 studies to a great extent. On the basis of the hypothesis that lexical errors \ncan cause more serious communication problems than grammatical ones, it was expected that the \nproportion of corrected lexical errors would exceed that of the corrected grammatical mistakes. \nThe similar correction rate of the two types of errors, however, suggests that contrary to the \nassumptions of previous studies (e.g. van Hest, 1996; Poulisse & Bongaerts, 1994), the monitor \nof the participants of this study was not sensitive to lexical errors to a greater extent than to other \ntypes of errors. It has to be noted, however, that the earlier studies drew their conclusions merely \nfrom the proportion of various types of self-repairs (van Hest, 1996) and from the corrections of \naccidental code-switching (Poulisse & Bongaerts, 1994) in their corpus and did not analyze the \ncorrection rate of errors. The L2 results obtained in the present project are also in opposition \nwith the L1 data because in L1 speech participants corrected a higher proportion of their lexical \nerrors than their grammatical errors. \n Before elaborating the possible reasons for this finding, we have to point out the \nlimitations of the study in this respect. Although the correction rate of errors is a more precise \nindicator of the sensitivity of the monitor towards different types of errors than the frequency of \nself-repairs, it may not directly reflect this sensitivity for two reasons. Firstly, the error can be \nnoticed prior to articulation and can be repaired before the utterance is articulated (covert \nrepairs), a process that was not investigated in the study. As one of the reviewers pointed out, the \nlocal nature of lexical errors might make them better candidates for covert repairs than \ngrammatical errors, thus a certain proportion of lexical-error repairs might not surface. Second, \nspeakers might actually perceive the mistake in the utterance and consciously decide not to \ncorrect it (MacKay, 1987), for which there is sporadic evidence from the retrospective comments \nmade by the participants of the study (see below). \n In the knowledge of the limitations of the research, the results can be explained in the \nfollowing ways. The Perceptual Loop Theory of monitoring (Levelt, 1989, 1993) assumes that \nthe monitor parses the speakers\u2019 output in the same way as it does the interlocutor\u2019s speech. \nBased on this model of language production, it can also be presumed that the parsing process \ninvolves the comparison of the utterance with the speakers\u2019 existing system of the L2. Research \nin this field also seems to prove that monitoring is a conscious process (Levelt, 1989), which \nrequires attentional control. Therefore it can be assumed that the amount of attention available \nfor monitoring will influence the efficiency of this process. This seems to be especially \nimportant in the case of L2 speakers, whose production processes are only partially automatic, \nand require more attention than encoding mechanisms in L1. Kahneman\u2019s (1973) and Wicken\u2019s \n(1989) models of attentional control postulate that if two processes draw on the same pool of \nattentional resources, the processes will compete for attention, and performance will deteriorate. \nAs monitoring and speech encoding both require resources from the verbal pool of attention, \nattention needs to be divided between them. One would expect that attentional limitations cause \nthat learners focus more on the correctness of lexical entries than on grammatical accuracy. The \nsimilar correction rate of lexical and grammatical L2 errors found in the present study, however, \ndoes not seem to indicate that this bottle-neck effect would result in the monitor\u2019s different \nsensitivity towards lexical and grammatical errors in L2. Therefore, one possible conclusion that \ncan be drawn from the results of the project is that the monitor of L2 speakers does not always \nhandle lexical and grammatical errors differently, and attention can be equally divided between \nmonitoring for correct lexical choice and linguistic accuracy. \n An alternative explanation would be that despite the fact that speakers pay more attention \nto monitoring for lexical choice than for grammatical accuracy, some other mechanisms at work \ncan cause this difference not to surface in the correction rate of errors. One of these factors might \nbe the difference between the ease of correction of grammatical and lexical errors. It might be \npossible that despite the fact that less attention is paid to grammatical accuracy than to lexical \nappropriacy, filtering out grammatical errors is considerably easier than noticing erroneous \nlexical choice. The reason for this might be that in the case of monitoring for grammatical \naccuracy, the produced utterance is compared with a finite set of rules. Parsing the lexical items \nof the message, however, involves a search in the lexicon. The lexicon not only contains \nconsiderably more entries than there are rules of grammar, but one lexical entry also comprises \nat least three types of information (semantic value, argument structure and phonological form \n(Bierwisch & Schreuder, 1992)) that also need to be checked. Nooteboom\u2019s (1980) finding that \n75% of the phonological and 53% of the lexical errors were corrected in Meringer\u2019s (1908) \ncorpus also suggests that it requires less effort to inspect the phonological form of a word than to \nexamine whether it fits the syntactic environment, the context and whether it corresponds to the \nintended to concept. Thus, despite the fact that lexical errors are more disruptive in ongoing \ncommunication than both phonological and grammatical errors are, and speakers might pay \nspecial attention to them, the difficulty of checking lexical accuracy will result in a decreased \nefficiency of the monitoring processes in this respect. This explanation, however, is rather \nsimplistic. V\u00e1rady (personal communication, March 1999) pointed out that in the analysis of \ncorpora, it became evident that even though there is only a finite number of rules of grammar, \nthere is a high number of grammatical decision points within a sentence. At each of these points \nthe number of possibilities for the choice of grammatical rules increases exponentially. Besides, \nif grammatical errors were easier to notice in general, L1 speakers would also correct a higher \nproportion of their grammatical errors, which was not the case in the present study.  \n The findings can have another more plausible explanation. As assumed by the Perceptual \nLoop Theory of monitoring, after the monitor has detected the error, it will send a warning signal \nto the conceptualizer (Levelt, 1989, 1993). This module is supposed to have access to several \nknowledge stores such as the stores of situational knowledge and the discourse model (Levelt, \n1989, 1993). It can be assumed that the correction will not always be implemented \nautomatically. On the basis of the information available in the conceptualizer, a conscious \ndecision will be made about whether or not to correct the mistake and if so, which part of the \nutterance to repair. Kahneman\u2019s (1973) and Wickens\u2019 (1989) models of attention also presume \nthat attention can be controlled voluntarily. Retrospective comments confirm that the \nparticipants of the study who performed the task in L2 sometimes decided not to correct their \nmistakes even though they had noticed them. In these cases they either wanted to sound more \nfluent, or they thought their message was understandable in the erroneous form as well. The \ndecision which errors to correct can be influenced by several factors, such as the informational \ncontent of the erroneous word or expression, the speakers\u2019 striving for precise expression, and \ntheir belief concerning the acceptable level of fluency and accuracy in the given situation. As \npointed out by one of the reviewers, speakers might also be influenced by their awareness that an \nerror cannot be repaired appropriately in the given situation. The retrospective comments made \nby the participants of the study also support these assumptions. In (1) the speaker noticed that \nshe had made an error, but believing that the utterance was understandable in the erroneous form \nas well, she did not want to correct it for the sake of sounding fluent. (2) is very similar to the \nprevious example. In this case the participant also perceived the error, but wanted to produce the \nutterance fluently and did not execute the correction. Unfortunately, the scarcity of this type of \nretrospective data in the study does not allow the analysis of speakers\u2019 different attitude to \nlexical and grammatical errors. \n(1) do you change er your date  \nRetrospective comment: As I was saying this sentence, I noticed that it was incorrect, but \nI did not want to repeat the whole sentence again. I was told by my teachers that \nrepeating a sentence sounds strange, and it matters more that you produce the sentence \nfluently than the fact that it contains an error. \n( 2) would you like to er rent our er room? \nRetrospective comment: I noticed that rent was not the right word here, but I tried to say \nthe sentence as fast as possible and did not bother to correct it. \n \n In sum, the correction rate of errors is not only a reflection of the sensitivity of the \nmonitor towards different types of errors, but also signals conscious decisions concerning error \ncorrection. The similar correction rate of grammatical and lexical errors found in the L2 data of \nthe study most probably suggests that the participants attributed approximately the same level of \nimportance to grammatical and lexical errors when consciously deciding on the correction. This \ncan be due to the fact that the mixed type of grammatical and communicative method of \ninstruction these learners had received made them believe that grammatical accuracy is very \nimportant for successful communication, and grammatical errors should be regarded as serious \nflaws in one\u2019s performance. The comparison of the judgments of linguistic errors across \ndifferent groups of language learners (involving a similar Hungarian sample) carried out by \nBardovi-Harlig and D\u00f6rnyei (1998) seems to lend support to this claim. Their findings indicated \nthat grammatical errors were more salient for L2 speakers in a foreign language setting than for \nL2 learners in a naturalistic environment. The L1 data in my study also support this line of \nargumentation as in L1 speech the participants attributed considerably smaller importance to \ngrammatical errors than to lexical errors. \n The similarity of the correction rate of all the types of errors across groups at different \nlevels of proficiency seems to indicate that the amount of attention paid to monitoring the \nlinguistic accuracy of the message does not change significantly with the development of \nproficiency. The reason for this finding might be that in language teaching in Hungary form \nfocussed instruction complemented with communicative activities is general (Enyedy & \nMedgyes, 1998; Nikolov, 1999). This type of language teaching also means that even at a high-\nlevel of L2 proficiency, learners are constantly reminded by their teachers to pay attention to the \nform of their utterances, and that grammar activities form an essential part of advanced language \ncourses. \nThe correlational analyses of the frequency of appropriacy repairs and the proficiency-\ntest scores showed that with the increase of proficiency L2 speakers pay more attention to the \ninformational content of their message than to linguistic accuracy. The explanation for this \nprobably lies in how attention is allocated for the various phases of speech processing at \ndifferent levels of L2 competence. It is a widely accepted assumption in L2 research that \nadvanced and beginning speakers differ as regards the amount of declarative knowledge \navailable for them about the L2 and the automaticity of their linguistic encoding mechanisms \n(e.g. De Keyser, 1997; Robinson, 1997; Schmidt, 1992). Based on Kahneman's (1973) and \nWickens' (1989) model of attentional control, it can be assumed that due to the increased level of \nautomaticity in lexical, grammatical, and phonological encoding, proficient speakers have more \nattention available for the other stages of message production. These remaining phases are the \nconceptualization of the message, that is, planning the informational content and structure of the \nmessage, and monitoring, which involves parsing both linguistic accuracy and contextual \nappropriacy. Thus the results concerning the frequency of appropriacy repairs suggest that the \nextra attention available for high-level learners can be used for monitoring for the informational \ncontent of their message.  \n \nImplications and future directions for research \n  The study reported in this paper investigated the role of attention in monitoring L2 \nproduction. By means of analyzing the global distribution of self-repairs and the correction rate \nof errors at various levels of L2 competence and in the participants' L1, a number of results have \nbeen obtained that shed light on new factors affecting monitoring and speech encoding processes \nin L2. \n The global distribution of self-repairs indicated that in an information exchange task \nHungarian L2 learners paid approximately equal attention to the appropriacy and adequacy of \nthe informational content of their utterance as to linguistic accuracy. The analysis of the \ncorrection rate of lexical and grammatical errors seemed to show a similar tendency. I have \nargued, however, that the similarity of the proportion of corrected lexical and grammatical \ninaccuracies does not necessarily mean that L2 speakers\u2019 attention is equally divided between \nmonitoring for the lexical appropriacy and the grammatical accuracy of their message. The lack \nof observable differences between the correction rate of grammatical and lexical errors might \nhave been caused by the fact that in the present study covert repairs were not investigated. The \nretrospective comments suggested that speakers made conscious decisions concerning the \nimplementation of the repair in L2. It was pointed out that this decision can be influenced by \nseveral factors such as the accuracy demand of the situation, the learners\u2019 perception of how \nseriously the error impedes successful communication, and to what extent the correction \ndecreases the fluency of the utterance. Therefore, the similar correction rate of grammatical and \nlexical errors might indicate that upon deciding whether to repair a mistake, the participants of \nthe present project did not attribute different importance to grammatical inaccuracies and \nincorrect lexical choice.  \n These results are interesting from several aspects. First of all, they show that the general \nclaim made by researchers in the field that upon monitoring in L2, attention is focused more on \ninformation content than on linguistic form (e.g. Fathman, 1989; Lennon, 1984; Poulisse, 1993, \nPoulisse & Bongaerts, 1994; van Hest, 1996) does not hold for all types of L2 learners. Formally \ninstructed foreign language speakers in countries where explicit grammar teaching plays a \nsignificant role in the curriculum, everyday teaching practice and state-level language testing, \ncan allocate their attentional resources and make decisions concerning error corrections in a \ndifferent way from learners in a second language environment or from students instructed with a \npurely communicative method. \n The investigation of the allocation of attention upon monitoring across groups of learners \nat different levels of proficiency also yielded novel results in this field. By means of the analysis \nof the correction rate of lexical and grammatical errors, it was found that the amount of attention \npaid to the linguistic accuracy of the message remains constant at various stages of SLA. This \ncan also be due to the instructional practices in language teaching in Hungary. The results also \nshowed that owing to the high level of automaticity of the speech encoding mechanisms of \nadvanced learners, these speakers have additional attention available for monitoring which they \nuse for checking the discourse level aspects of their message. \n The other interesting outcome of the project is that the correction rate of errors reflects \nthree aspects of monitoring: (1) how attention is allocated when the monitor compares the output \nwith the learner\u2019s existing L2 system; (2) how difficult it is for the speaker to carry out this \ncomparison; and (3) what affects whether the correction is executed. Therefore, it has to be \nconcluded that the research design of the present study only provides an indirect insight into the \nsensitivity of monitoring processes towards different errors. Thus one direction for further \nresearch can be carrying out studies under laboratory conditions, in which the possibility that \nspeakers consciously decide not to repair an utterance could be excluded. Further studies should \nalso be designed in which it is possible to separate the effect of the difficulty of monitoring for \ncertain types of errors and the influence of the allocation of attention upon monitoring. It would \nalso be worth investigating in more detail in the future how the type of classroom instruction \nlearners receive and the task they have to perform influence the way they manage their \nattentional resources in L2 speech production. Another direction for future research can be \nstudying the influence of the researcher's instructions concerning what the participants should \npay attention to when performing the task. \n \n \n \nTable 1  \nThe analysis of variance of the C-test scores of the participants \n \n \nVariable \n \nGroup \n \nMean \n( N \nMax \n=63) \n \nSD \n \nSource of \nvariance \n \nSS \n \ndf \n \nMS \n \nF  \n pre-interm. 23.20 5.67 Between groups 5913.87 2 2956.93 130.45* \nC-test  \nscore \nupper-\ninterm. \n47.00 5.43 Within groups 612.00 27 22.66  \n advanced 56.60 2.50 Total 6464.00 29   \n         \n*p <0.001 \nAll the three groups are different from each other at the p < 0.05 level \n \nTable 2 \nThe frequency of main groups of self-repairs \n \n L1 L2 \nVariable Mean \n(per 100 \nwords) \nSD % N Mean \n(per 100 \nwords) \nSD % n \n         \nE-repairs 0.21 0.96 20.4 10 1.09 1.01 38.7 112 \n         \nA-repairs 0.67 0.51 57.1 28 0.53 0.47 22.8 66 \n         \nD-repairs 0.26 0.31 22.4 11 0.51 0.45 21.8 63 \n         \nR-repairs 0.00 0.00 0.0 0 0.37 0.37 15.2 44 \n         \nRest 0.00 0.00 0.0 0 0.04 0.02 1.5 4 \n         \nTotal \n \n0 0 100 49 2.53 1.35 100 289 \n \nE-repairs = error repairs;

Then you \nhave to negotiate that and talk about the drinks \nwith the barman. \nRetrospection: I corrected what I said because it \nwas not clear whether you have to talk about the \ndrinks or the price with the barman. \n \n  \n \nCoherent terminology (AC-) repair \n \n \nThe speaker repairs incoherent terminology \n(Levelt, 1983). \nin this case er if it is so urgent and important for \nyou, we would like er you to:: to write us an order \n- er in er 24 hours that you make sure that you will \ner come and book this eel room. \n..... \nR: I see, all right and then I can only pay the \ndeposit next week when I er find out how many \npeople come and when I have talked to all of the \npeople. \nS: Er but this letter is er - the order- er your \nrequest is er anyway - needed and we::: \nRetrospection: I remembered that I had used the \nword \u2018order\u2019 earlier, and I wanted to stick to the \nsame terms, so I replaced \u2018letter\u2019 with \u2018order\u2019. \n \n  \nPragmatic appropriacy (AP-) repair \n \nThe speaker repairs part of the message which is \npragmatically inappropriate in the given situation \n(based on Br\u00e9dart, 1991) \nCan I what can I do for you? \nRetrospection: First I wanted to say 'can I help \nyou', but I thought this is said in shops only, and I \ndecided to say 'what can I do for you' because it \nwas more appropriate in this situation. \nRepair for good language (AG-) The speaker repairs part of the message which \nhe\/she judges to be not sophisticated enough \nconcerning the manner of expression \nIf you want the room, I mean if you decide on it \nRetrospection: I was not satisfied with this \nsentence with the word 'want' in it, I did not like it \nstylistically \n \nAppendix 2 \nThe classification of errors \nType of the error Example \nLexical error  \nInappropriate choice of content words my chef can make *cancer very good \nInappropriate choice of prepositions and auxiliaries \nwith independent conceptual specifications \nif you need this room you need to tell me \n*before twenty hours \nCollocational errors we can cook er *to taste \nThe erroneous production of a derivative form you have to write a *confirmament \nGrammatical errors  \nInaccurate use of inflectional morphology it *have to be er uhm uhm thirty-five people \nInappropriate choice of tense, aspect or voice of the \nverb phrase \nbut I *don\u2019t mention er the room is er only \non the er eighteen and on the nineteen of \nDecember free \nFaulty encoding of complements and specifiers you have to pay er the uhm twenty-five er \npercent *the uhm the price \nWrong word order Minimum er thirty-five er people er have to \nbe er then *can I er let it for you \nInappropriate choice of prepositions and auxiliaries \naccessed by syntactic building procedures  \nwe may make a contract if you er if you \n*will pay more \n* signals the beginning of the erroneous part of the utterance \n"}
