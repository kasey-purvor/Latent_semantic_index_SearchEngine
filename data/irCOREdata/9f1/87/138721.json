The\nsediment yield data set includes records from semi-natural catchments in northern Italy as\nwell and agricultural and semi-natural basins in central and southern Italy. The average\nsize of the catchments is 150 km\u00b2 with mean annual sediment yields ranging from 0.20 to\n20 ton.ha-1.y-1. WaTEM\/SEDEM estimates mean annual sediment fluxes to permanent\nriver channels. Depending on the local transport capacity, the sediment flux is detach-\nlimited or transport limited. The optimal transport capacity parameters for Italian\nconditions were derived via automatic calibration procedures. A global model calibration\nprocedure taking into account all catchments in the dataset led to an overestimation of the\nsediment yield for the mountain catchments and and underestimation for the non-\nmountain catchments. Sediment yield estimates are more reliable when calibration\nprocedures are applied separately for mountain and non-mountain catchments. The\nresults of this exercise suggest that the application of elementary process descriptions is\nsufficient to produce relatively accurate long-term sediment yield predictions if the\nspatial configuration of sediment sources and sinks is taken into account.\nKEYWORDS: Sediment yield, soil erosion, reservoirs, Italy\n31. INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES\nHuman-induced environmental change at a global scale is causing a spectacular increase\nof geomorphic process activity and sediment fluxes in many parts of the world (e.g.\nTurner et al., 1990, IGBP-BAHC, 1997, COST Action 623, 1999). The Mediterrean\nregion is particulary susceptible to erosion. This is because it is subject to long dry\nperiods followed by heavy bursts of erosive rainfall, falling in on steep slopes with fragile\nsoils, resulting in considerable amounts of soil erosion.\nThe consequences of soil erosion and sediment deposition occur both on \u2013and off-site.\nOn-site effects are particulary important on agricultural land where the redistribution of\nsoil within a field, the loss of soil from a field, the breakdown of soil structure and the\ndecline in organic matter and nutrients result in a reduction of cultivable soil depth and a\ndecline in soil fertility. The net effect is a loss of productivity, which at first, restricts\nwhat can be grown and results in increased expenditure on fertilizers, but later may lead\nto land abandonment (Pimentel et al., 1995, Crosson, 1997).\nOff-site problems problems result from sedimentation downstream, which reduces the\ncapacity of rivers and retention ponds, enhances the risk of flooding and muddy floods\nand shortens the design life of reservoirs (Clark, 1985 ; Boardman et al., 1994 ;\nVerstraeten and Poesen, 1999). Sediment is also a pollutant in its own right and, through\nthe agro-chemicals adsorbed to it, can increase the levels of nitrogen and phosphorus in\nwater bodies and result in eutrophication (Sibbesen, 1995 ; Steegen et al., 2001).\nNot surprinsingly soil erosion and sediment delivery have become important topics on the\nagenda of local, national and European policy makers. This has led to an increasing\ndemand for reliable scale soil erosion models to delineate target zones in which\nconservation measures are likely to be the most effective. Secondly, regional scale\nerosion models were requested to predict the geomorphic response of possible\nconservation measures at the scale of catchments.\nDespite the development of a range of phycically-based soil erosion and sediment\ntransport equations, sediment yield predictions at a regional scale are at present achieved\nmainly through simple empirical models that relate the annual sediment delivery by a\n4river to catchment properties, including drainage area, topography, climate and\nvegetation characteristics (e.g. Flaxman, 1972, Walling, 1983 ; Onstad, 1984 ; Bazzoffi et\nal., 1996, Lixian et al., 1996, Verstraeten and Poesen, 2001, Verstraeten et al., 2003).\nThe main reason why empirical regression equations are still widely used for sediment\nyield predictions is their simplicity which makes them applicable even if only a limited\namount of input data is available. Nevertheless, the predictive ability of this kind of\nequations is limited to particular regions they have been developped from. Moreover,\ninherent to a spatially lumped approach is that it is not possible to take into account the\nspatial structure of land use and topography within the catchment on sediment delivery.\nThis inherently limits its applicability to practical problems such as the evaluation of\ndifferent land management strategies on sediment delivery.\n(FIGURE 1 NEAR HERE)\nFigure 1: Two theorecital land use scenarios (left: with high SY, right with low SY)\nFigure 1 shows two theoretical land use scenarios in a catchment. The percentage of\nforest is the same in both land use scenarios but their spatial configuration is different.\nThe land use configuration with forest on the upslope parts of the catchment (left on\nFigure 1) results in a lower sediment yield than an alternative scenario with forest\nbordering the river (right on Figure 1) as in the second scenario an important fraction of\nthe eroded sediment is trapped before reaching a river channel.\nThe example described above shows the potential of spatial models that do take into\naccount the spatial configuration of a landscape and the connectivity between sediment\nsources and river channels. Advanced event-based models such as WEPP (Nearing et al.,\n1989), LISEM (De Roo, 1996), EUROSEM (Morgan et al., 1998), EROSION-3D\n(Schmidt et al., 1999) adopt such a spatially distributed approach by routing the eroded\nsediment from gridcell to gridcell. If the transport capacity at a certain gridcell is not\nsufficient, depostion occurs. The outcome of these models are spatial patterns of erosion\nand deposition as a result of single storm events. Their application of these relatively\ncomplex spatials models is, however, problematic at the scale of large catchments (> 100\nkm\u00b2) as the quality of the necessery input data is in general not sufficient at these scale\nlevels to succesfully apply the model equations.\n5As an alternative for the complex event-based distributed models more robust long-term\ndistributed models such as CAESAR (Coulthard et al., 2000) and WaTEM\/SEDEM (Van\nOost et al., 2000, Van Rompaey et al., 2001) were developped. They are based on a\nsimilar gridcell-to-gridcell routing aim at long-term predictions at regional scale levels.\nThis goal is achieved by aggregating physically-based event-parameters into empirical\nlong-term model-parameters. Hitherto, these long-term spatial sediment yield models\nhave been applied relatively successfully in northern and central Europe: UK (Coulthard\net al., 2002), Belgium (Van Rompaey et al., 2002), the Czech Republic (Van Rompaey et\nal., 2003a) and Germany (Lenhart et al., in press).\nThe objective of this paper is to examine wether a similar approach is feasable for the\nprediction of sediment yield in mountain catchments and in catchments with a\nmediterrenean climate. Therefore a dataset of sediment yield for 40 catchments in Italy\nwas retrieved from sediment deposition rates in reservoirs was made available by the\nInstituto Sperimentale per lo Studio e la Difesa dello Suolo in Firenze, Italy (ISSDS).\nFirstly, for each of the catchments all necessary input data for a WaTEM\/SEDEM\napplication were prepared. Next, the dataset with observed SY-values was used to\ncalibrate the model parameters. Finally, the correspondence between predicted and\nobserved sediment yield is examined.\n2. SEDIMENT YIELD DATA FOR ITALY\nBazzoffi et al. (1996) compiled a data set with sediment deposition rates for 40 reservoirs\nconstructed in the 1950\u2019s and 1960\u2019s throughout Italy (Figure 2). Sediment deposition\nrates were assessed by direct sonar sub-bottom profiler measurements or derived from\nestimates and measures made by ENEL (Italian Electricity Power Company) during\ndredging of the reservoirs.\n(FIGURE 2 NEAR HERE)\nFigure 2: Left: Reservoir in Campo-Tartano (Lombardy, Italy), Right: Reservoir in\nVolterra (Tuscany, Italy)\n6The reservoirs were selected from a larger database whereby only reservoirs with a likely\nsediment trapping efficiency of 100% were considered. Nevertheless, there is never a\n100% guarantee that that sediment trapped in a reservoir represents the total sediment\nyield from the watershed in the lapse of time from dam building to survey time. For this\nreason only 40 watershed-reservoir systems were selected from the database, retaining\nonly the better-known ones respect to management history (Figure 3).\nThe sediment volumes where converted to mass volumes using a mean bulk density of\n0.865 ton.m-3 derived from the direct analysis of sedimentary profiles of 4 reservoirs of\nthe dataset and from the application of equations of Lara and Pemberton (1963) and Lane\nand Koelzer (1943) for estimating sediment density from grain size distribution and\nregime of exposition to air of deposits.\nThe SY-data set includes data from semi-natural alpine basins in the north as wel as\nagricultural and semi-natural basins in central and south Italy. The average size of the\nbasins is 150 km\u00b2, ranging from 11 to 697 km\u00b2. The mean annual precipitation ranges\nfrom 480 mm in the south to 2380 mm in the Alps to the north. The measured area-\nspecific sediment yield varies between 0.1 t ha-1 y-1 and 16.8 t ha-1 y-1 (see Table 1)\n(TABLE 1 NEAR HERE)\nTable 1 Properties of 40 Italian Reservoirs\nThe area contributing to each catchment was delineated using a DEM with a resolution of\n75m x 75m made available through the GISCO data base of the European Commission.\nIn catchments with a \u2018cascade system\u2019 of reservoirs the area contributing to upslope\nreservoirs was not taken into consideration.\nThe sediment yield data show a very heterogeneous spatial pattern. The highest sediment\nyields (> 8 ton.ha-1.y-1) were observed in Sicily and in the northern Apenines. Low SY-\nvalues (< 1 ton.ha-1.y-1) were observed in Alps at the borders with Switzerland and France\n(see Figure 3).\n(FIGURE 3 NEAR HERE)\n7Figure 3: Location of 40 catchments with measured SY at the outlet\n3. ESTIMATING SEDIMENT YIELD WITH WaTEM\/SEDEM\n3.1. Model structure\nWaTEM\/SEDEM is a spatially explicit sediment delivery model. For a detailed\ndescription of the model we refer to Van Rompaey et al. (2001). In this paper only the\nbasic principles are described.\nWether or not eroded sediment is deposited within the basin depends on the travel\ndistance and the characteristics of the travel path. WaTEM\/SEDEM requires a layer of\nmean annual erosion rates and a layer with the location of permanent rivers in the basin\nas an input. For each pixel of the catchment, the mean annual transport capacity (TC in t\ny-1 is calculated using the following equation (Equation 1) :\nTC = KTC R K (L S \u20135.3 Sg 0.8) (Equation 1)\nWhere :\nR : RUSLE rainfall erosivity\nK : RUSLE soil erodibility in\nS : RUSLE slope factor (-)\nL : unit specific contributing area (-)\nSg : slope gradient\nKTC : transport capacity co\u00ebfficient\nKTC values are land use specific and can be assessed by means of calibration. Once the\nmean annual soil erosion rate and the mean annual transport capacity are known, a\nrouting algorithm is used to tranfer the eroded sediment from the source to the river\nnetwork via topographically derived flowpaths. For each grid cell the amount of sediment\ninput is added to the amount of soil erosion in that cell. If the sum of the sediment input\nand the local sediment production is lower than the transport capacity then all the\n8sediment is routed further down slope. If this sum exceeds the transport capacity then the\nsediment output from the pixel is limited to the transport capacity and there will be a net\nsediment deposition. This means that sediment transport is detachment limited or\ntransport capacity limited depending on the position in the landscape.\nWaTEM\/SEDEM assumes that river pixels have an infinitely high transport capacity.\nThis means that all the sediment that is reaches a permanent river channel is delivered to\nthe outlet of the basin. The output of the model consists of a pixel map representing the\namount of net erosion and net sediment deposition at each grid cell.\n3.2. Model parameter values\nMean annual soil erosion rates were assessed using USLE-procedures proposed by van\nder Knijff et al. (1999, 2002) and Grimm et al. (2003). The USLE (Universal Soil Loss\nEquation) is an empirical equation originally developped to assess mean annual soil\nlosses at the foot of a linear slope. The equation is as follows (Equation 2) :\nA = R K L S C (Equation 2)\nWhere :\nA = Mean annual soil loss (in t ha-1 yr-1)\nR = Rainfall erosivity factor (in MJ mm ha-1 h-1 yr-1)\nK = Soil erodibility factor (in t h MJ-1 mm-1)\nL = Slope length factor (dimensionless)\nS = Slope factor (dimensionless)\nC = Cover management factor (dimensionless)\nDesmet and Govers (1996) expanded the model with 2D-routing algorithms, wich allows\nthe application of the USLE-equation at complex 2D-landscapes. USLE-2D in which the\nthe one-dimensional slope-length factor (L) is replaced with an unit upslope area (L2D)\nincorporates soil loss by gully erosion (Desmet et al. 1999).\n9Grimm et al. (2003) derived rainfall erosivity values for Italy from monthly total rainfall\ndata (Pmonthly) at 366 meteorological stations for the period 1931 to 1960. The point data\nwere interpolated using nearest-neighbour analysis. Monthly rainfall erosivity values\nRmonthly were calculated as follows (Equation 3) :\nRmonthly = 1.3 * Pmonthly (Equation 3)\nWhere :\nRmonthly : the monthly rainfall erosivity factor (in MJ mm ha-1 h-1 yr-1)\nPmonthly : the total monthly rainfall (in mm)\nGrimm et al. (2003) derived soil erodibility values (K) were derived soil texture data\nmade available through the 1 : 250 000 soil map of Italy using an equation proposed by\nR\u00f6mkens et al. (1986) (Equation 4) :\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0eb\n\uf0e9\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6 \uf02b\uf02d\uf02b\uf03d\n2\n71.0\n659.1log\n5.0exp*0405.00034.0\nDg\nK (Equation 4)\nWhere :\nK : soil erodibility factor (in t h MJ-1 mm-1)\nDg : geometric mean weight diameter of the primary soil particles (in mm)\nVulcanic soils have an erodibility beyond the range that is predicted by Equation 4.\nTherefore an erodibility value of 0.08 t h MJ-1 mm-1 was assigned to all volcanic soils\n(Dino Torri, personal communication).\nVan der Knijff et al. (1999) assessed monthly cover management factor values for Italy\nusing Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer imagery (AVHRR) with a ground\nresolution of 1 km\u00b2. AVHRR-imagery was used to calculate NDVI-values. Next the\nNDVI values were linked with cover management factors (C) using the following\nfunction (Equation 5)\n10\n\uf0fa\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\uf0eb\n\uf0e9\n\uf02d\n\uf02d\uf03d\nNDVI\nNDVI\nC\n1\n.2exp (Equation 5)\nWhere :\nC : cover management factor (-)\nNDVI : normalised difference vegetation index (-)\nAs NDVI is only sensitive for healthy, photosynthetically active vegetation, C-values are\nunrealistically high for forest in winter months. Therefore the maximum monthly cover\nmanagement factor for woodland was defined at 0.01.\nSlope gradient (S) and slope length (L) factors were calculated using a 75 DEM made\navailable through the GISCO database of the European Commission. A flux\ndecomposition algorithm developped by Desmet and Govers (1996) was used to assess\nthe upslope area of each grid cell. Next the equations proposed by McCool et al. (1987,\n1989) were used to assess the topographic factor LS.\nEventually for each grid cell of 75m x 75m a mean annual erosion rate (A in ton.ha-1.y-1)\nwas assessed using the following equation (Equation 6) :\n\uf0e5\n\uf03d\n\uf03d\n12\n1\n....\ni\nii SLCKRA Equation 6\nThe transport capacity (TC, Equation 1) was assessed using RUSLE-parameters\ncalculated with the same procedures and data as described above. Transport capacity\ncoefficients (KTC) were assessed by means of calibration for different land cover types.\n3.3. Model calibration\nParameter values for WaTEM\/SEDEM are available for landscapes in central Belgium\n(Van Rompaey et al., 2002), the Czech Republic (Van Rompaey et al., 2003a) and South\nAfrica (Van Rompaey et al., 2003b). The catchments in the Italian dataset presented here\n11\nare characterised by completely different landscapes than than the previously mentioned\nstudies. Moreover, Van Rompaey et al. (2001) reported that optimal WaTEM\/SEDEM\nparameters are dependent on the quality and the resolution of the input data. Therefore,\nmodel parameters proposed in other model application are not necesserily valid.\nGiven the limited number of data in the dataset only the transport capacity parameters\nfor arable land (KTC-A) and for forest\/pasture (KTC-FP) were calibrated. The parameters\nused in the erosion component of the model were not calibrated against the SY-dataset as\nthe calibration of multiple parameters leads to equifinality problems. The CORINE land\ncover data (GISCO-database) was used to delineate the two land use categories.\nThe calibration procedure was carried out as follows. For each catchment of the dataset\nthe model was run with KTC-A values ranging from 5 to 50 and for KTC-FP from 2 to 20.\nFor each parameter combination of KTC-A and KTC-FP an area specific sediment yield\nvalues was calculated for the 40 catchments. This allowed a comparison of the measured\nand predicted values for each parameter combination. The Model Efficiency (ME) as\nproposed by Nash and Sutcliffe (1970) was used as a measure of likelihood (Equation 7) .\n\uf028 \uf029\n\uf028 \uf029\uf0e5\n\uf0e5\n\uf02d\n\uf02d\uf02d\uf03d 2\n2\n1\nMEANOBS\nPREDOBS\nSYSY\nSYSY\nME Equation 7\nwhere ME is the model efficiency, SYOBS is the observed Sediment Yield, SYPRED is the\npredicted sediment yield and SYMEAN is the mean observed sediment yield. Values for\nME range from -\uf0a5 to 1. The closer ME approximates 1, the better the model will predict\nindividual values. The results of these simulations are plotted in Figure 4.\n(FIGURE 4 NEAR HERE)\nFigure 4 : Calibration of transport capacity parameters (left: KTC for forest-\npasture, right: KTC for arable land)\nThe results show an optimal value for KTC_FP at 12 and an optimal value for KTC_A at\n30. Calibration curve of the KTC_FP has a very flat top from which it may be concluded\n12\nthat the model when applied to the complete dataset is not very sensitive to this\nparameter. With the optimal parameter values a model efficiency coefficient of \u20130.33 is\nobtained. This means that WaTEM\/SEDEM is not efficient in predicting sediment yield\nif no differentiation is made between different landscape groups. Modelled versus\nosberved sediment yield are plotted in Figure 5.\n(FIGURE 5 NEAR HERE)\nFigure 5 : Observed versus predicted sediment yield (in ton.ha-1.y-1) (transport\ncapacity parameters derived from \u2018global\u2019 calibration procedure)\n4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nWhen WaTEM\/SEDEM is run with optimal model parameters the were derived via\nglobal calibration the correspondence between observed and predicted mean annual\nsediment yield values is relatively low with a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.21.\nMoreover, the model efficiency (ME) is negative (-0.33), which means that the mean\nvalue of the dataset is on average a better estimate for an individual sediment yield value\nthan a WaTEM\/SEDEM model prediction. Nevertheless, Figure 5 shows a relative good\ncorrelation between observed and predicted values for catchments with an observed mean\nannual sediment yield higher than 3 ton.ha-1.y-1. The model predictions for catchments\nwith an observed mean annual sediment yield lower than 3 ton.ha-1.y-1 are in general\noverestimations. Some of the sediment yield estimates for alpine catchments are outliers\nas the predicted values are more than 10 times higher than observed values.\nOut of this observation may be concluded that for a more accurate application of\nWaTEM\/SEDEM the calibration of the transport capacity co\u00ebfficients must be based on a\nset of similar catchments in terms of topography and land use. The calibration and\napplication of WaTEM\/SEDEM was for example relatively succesful in central Belgium\n(Van Rompaey et al., 2001) and the Czech Republic (Van Rompaey et al., 2003a). In\nboth cases calibration was based on catchments with rather similar landscape properties:\n13\nin Belgium rolling arable land on loess soils and in the Czech Republic a mixture of\narable land, pasture and forest in an hilly environment.\nThe landscapes in the Italian catchments that are under investigation in this study,\nhowever, are very divers: semi-natural alpine mountain landscapes in the North-Italy,\nhilly areas with forest, arable land and vineyards in central Italy and semi-arid catchments\nwith extensive agriculture and degraded land in South-Italy.\nTherefore the catchment dataset was split in two groups: catchments with an average\nslope gradient over 40% and catchments with an average slope gradient under 40%. Next,\ncalibration of the transport capacity parameters was done for both groups separately\n(Figures 6 and 7).\n(FIGURE 6 NEAR HERE)\nFigure 6: Calibration for mountain catchments (slope gradient > 40%) only\n(FIGURE 7 NEAR HERE)\nFigure 7: Calibration for non-mountain catchments (slope gradient < 40%)\nAn overview of the optimal parameter values derived via stratified and global calibration\nprocedures is given in Table 2.\n(TABLE 2 NEAR HERE)\nTable 2: Overview of optimal KTC-values for arable land (KTC_A) and\npasture\/forest (KTC_FP)\nTable 2 shows that the optimal transport capacity coefficients on arable land (KTC_A-\nvalues) are similar in the mountain and non-mountain catchments. The calibration chart\nfor KTC_A-values in the mountain catchments (Figure 6), suggest however, that the\nmodel is not very sensitive to this parameter which is logical as only a minor part of\nmountain catchments are under arable land. The similarity between KTC_A-values for\nmountain and non-mountain catchments is therefore not really significant.\n14\nThe optimal transport capacity coefficient for forest and pasture (KTC_FP-values),\nhowever, is significantly lower in mountain environments than in non-mountain\nenvironments. This suggests that under the same topographic circumstances gridcells\nunder forest and pasture in mountain areas can transport less sediment than gridcells\nunder forest and pasture in non-mountain catchments. A possible explanation for this\nfinding is that forest and pasture in mountain catchments and non-mountain catchments\nhave indeed a significantly different behaviour with respect to runoff generation and\nsediment transport due differences in erosion mechanisms and vegetation properties. It\nshould however be kept in mind that sediment yield modelling consists of two\ncomponents : 1) an assessment of the produced sediment. 2) an assessment of the total\nsediment delivery ratio. It is obvious that a systematic overprediction of soil erosion in\nmountain areas leads to the underestimation of the calibrated transport capacity\nco\u00ebfficients. In the ideal situation both model components are calibrated separately. This\nis, however, only possible for catchments where long-term soil loss rates are monitored.\nObserved verus predicted sediment yield with the optimal transport capacity parameters\nderived from the stratified calibration procedures are shown in Figure 8.\n(FIGURE 8 NEAR HERE)\nFigure 8: Observed versus predicted sediment yield (transport capacity derived via\nstratified calibration procedures)\nThe sediment yield predictions derived via stratified calibration procedures are more\naccurate than the predictions resulting from a global calibration procedure. The\ncorrelation between observed and predicted long term sediment yield is 0.50 and the\nmodel efficiency for the total dataset is 0.14 (see Table 2). Model predictions are more\naccurate for non-mountain catchments. The lower performance of WaTEM\/SEDEM in\nthe mountain catchments suggests that the model structure is possibly too simplefied for\nan accurate description of sediment flux processes in such environments. The erosion\ncomponent of the model is based on a simplified USLE-2D (Desmet and Govers, 1996b)\napplication which in principle only takes into account rill, interrill and gully erosion.\nProcesses such as rockfall, avalanches and glacial erosion are not taken into account.\n15\nMoreover, WaTEM\/SEDEM assumes that the permanent river channels have an infinite\ntransport capacity which means that rivers are not supposed to store sediment over longer\ntimespans, which is obviously not always the case.\n5. CONCLUSIONS\nIn this paper sediment fluxes in 40 Italian catchment were modelled with the best data\navailable at national scale. Long term sedimentation records were used to validate the\nmodel results at the outlet. The catchments in the dataset are however very divers. Global\ncalibration procedures that assume that the optimal transport capacity coefficients are\nsimilar in all catchments were not succesfull. A stratified calibration procedure whereby a\ndistinction was made between mountain and non-mountain catchments resulted in a\nhigher model performance. Better results where obtained if lower values are used for the\ntransport capacity coefficient for forest and pasture in mountain catchments. It is,\nhowever, not clear wether these lower transport capacity coefficients represent real\ndifferences in sediment transport mechanisms or wether they are the logical consequence\nof a systematic overprediction of the sediment production in mountain environments.\nThis problem can only be solved if data on erosion and deposition patterns within the\ncatchments become available.\nEven with optimal model parameters the performance of WaTEM\/SEDEM is rather poor\nin the mountain catchments (R = 0.25), which suggests that the processes included in the\nmodel are probably to simplied to come to an adequate description of the sediment\nfluxes. This finding is a strong plead for the development of parsimonious sediment flux\nmodels for mountain catchments that include all necessary processes but that are as\nsimple as possible in order to facilitate their application at catchment scale.\nThe model performance for the non-mountain catchments in the dataset is better than for\nthe mountain catchments (R = 0.50). From land management point of view this finding is\npositive as to them it is much more important to predict accerated sediment fluxes under\ncropland than in (semi-)natural mountain areas. Similar model approaches in humid\ntemperate areas resulted in higher model efficiencies. This may, however, at least partly\nbe contributed to the fact that in this study datalayers with a 75m x 75m resolution were\n16\nused which is a much coarser grid than the 20m x 20m resolution used in the other\napplications. Considering the fact that high resolution SRTM-elevation data (Shuttle\nRadar Topography Mission) will become available on a global scale, the results presented\nin this paper are at least promising.\nNevertheless, this study points out that the model concept of WaTEM\/SEDEM not\nsuitable for an accurate assessment of the complex sediment delivery processes in Alpine\nmountain catchments and that further research is necessary to fully understand and model\nsuch systems.\n17\nREFERENCES\nBazzoffi, P., Baldassarre G., Vacca S. 1996.
