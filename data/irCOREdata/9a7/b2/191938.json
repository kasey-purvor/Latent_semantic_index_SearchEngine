The A-current exhibited rapid \nvoltage-dependent inactivation and was half-inactivated at resting membrane \npotentials. Following a hyperpolarising pre-pulse to remove inactivation, the peak \ntransient current was 1.07 nA at -17 mV. The pharmacological characteristics of this \nA-current were consistent with Kv4 subunits in expression studies; the A-current was \nresistant to block by tetraethylammonium and dendrotoxin-I, but sensitive to \nmillimolar concentrations of 4-aminopyridine and 5 \u03bcM hanatoxin. \nImmunohistochemistry confirmed that Kv4.3 subunits are present in the MNTB. In a \nsingle-compartment model of an MNTB neurone, the A-current served to accelerate \nthe decay of the initial action potentials in a stimulus train and suggested that \nremoval of A-current steady-state inactivation could raise firing threshold for non-\ncalyceal synaptic inputs. This A-type current was not observed in the rat. \nIntroduction \nExcitability is controlled across many different neuronal types by expression of \nvariable suites of potassium channels from up to 12 different gene families {Coetzee, \n1999 #6}. Although recombinant homomeric channels are well characterised, the \nspecific roles of many native ion channels in identified neurones has still to be \nelucidated. The principal neurones of the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body \n(MNTB) are an attractive preparation for studying native K+ channels, since these \nrelatively compact neurones facilitate good voltage control, {Brew, 1995 #7; Brew, \n2007 #17; Brew, 2003 #10; Dodson, 2002 #8; Kaczmarek, 2005 #21; Klug, 2006 #22; \nWang, 1998 #23}. The MNTB functions as an inverting relay in the auditory \nbrainstem circuits underlying the physiological mechanisms of sound source \nlocalisation {Masterton, 1967 #42}. This function requires temporally accurate \ntransmission of AP firing in the pre-synaptic neurone to AP firing in the MNTB \nprincipal neurone.  While the giant calyx of Held synapse assists security of \ntransmission, the magnitude of the EPSC requires precise expression of voltage-\ngated potassium channels to suppress hyper-excitability {Dodson, 2002 #8; \nSchneggenburger, 2006 #44} Kv1 potassium channels are responsible for \nsuppression of excitability at voltages around the action potential (AP) threshold; \nwhile Kv3 potassium channels mediate rapid AP repolarisation and hence promote \nhigh frequency firing {Brew, 1995 #7; Wang, 1998 #23}. Together, these currents \nallow the postsynaptic neurone to follow the pattern of AP firing of the major synaptic \ninput (the calyx of Held).  \n \nMNTB neurones also possess other potassium currents, including a transient \noutward potassium current or A-current. A-type K+ currents are expressed at several \nsites along the auditory pathway, including: type II spiral ganglion neurones {Jagger, \n2003 #29}, a subpopulation of Type I cells of the ventral cochlear nucleus {Rothman, \n2003 #28}, lateral olivocochlear (LOC) neurones of the lateral superior olive {Fujino, \n1997 #31} and in the dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus {Fu, 1996 #26}.  In this \npaper we characterise an A-type current in mouse MNTB.  We demonstrate that \nprincipal neurones possess a small, rapidly inactivating A-current mediated by Kv4 \nsubunits. We assess the significance of this current by modelling its contribution to \nMNTB whole cell currents. At resting membrane potentials, it is largely inactivated \nbut, following hyperpolarisation which removes inactivation, it may serve to \naccelerate AP time-course. Intriguingly, rat MNTB neurones do not possess this \ncurrent. \n \nMaterials and Methods \nElectrophysiology: Brainstem slices (120-150\u00b5m thick) were prepared as described \npreviously {Dodson, 2002 #8}. Briefly, 10-14 or 18-19 day CBA mice were killed by \ndecapitation in accordance with the UK animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. \nThe brainstem was mounted on the stage of an Integraslice (Campden Instruments, \nLoughborough, UK) and transverse slices cut in a low-sodium artificial \ncerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) at around 0oC. Subsequently, slices were incubated at \n37oC in normal aCSF for one hour, and were then allowed to cool to room \ntemperature. For recording, one slice was placed in the environmental chamber on \nthe stage of a Nikon FN600 microscope and perfused with aCSF (~1ml min-1 at 25-\n270C). Whole-cell patch recordings were made from visually identified neurones in \nthe MNTB using an Optopatch amplifier (Cairn, Faversham, UK). Patch pipettes \n(borosilicate glass, GC150F-7.5, Harvard Apparatus, Edenbridge, UK) contained a \nsolution of composition (in mM) 97.5 K-Gluconate, 32.5 KCl, 10 HEPES, 5 \nEGTA, 0.01 ZD 7288 (was included in voltage-clamp recordings to block Ih) and \n1 MgCl2 (pH 7.2 with KOH).  Patch pipettes had series resistances of 4-12M\u03a9 and \nwere compensated by at least 75% with 10\u00b5s lag. A holding potential of -77mV was \nused under voltage-clamp and neurones under current clamp were held at between \u2013\n67mV and \u201377 mV; recordings were excluded from analysis if >250pA of current was \nrequired to do this.  The normal aCSF contained (in mM): 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 10 \nGlucose, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 2 sodium pyruvate, 3 myo-inositol, 0.5 ascorbic acid, 0.5 \nCaCl2 and 2.5 MgCl2. The low-sodium aCSF contained (in mM): 2.5 KCl, 10 Glucose, \n1.25 NaH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3, 250 sucrose, 0.5 ascorbic acid, 0.1 CaCl2, and 3.9 \nMgCl2. All aCSFs were bubbled with 95%O2\/5%CO2 giving a pH of 7.4. \n \nData acquisition and analysis: The majority of data were collected from P10-14 \nanimals, with an additional 5 cells from P18-19 animals. Data were acquired using \npClamp 9.2 and a Digidata 1322A interface (Molecular Devices) filtered at 2-5kHz \nand digitised at 10-50kHz. All voltages were corrected for a -7mV junction potential \nand no leak subtraction was performed. Data are presented as means \u00b1SEM and a \ntwo-tailed Student\u2019s t-test (paired or unpaired) was used to assess significance. \nActivation and inactivation parameters were determined by a Boltzmann function of \nthe form I=Imax \/ (1+e(V-V1\/2\/k)) with variables Imax, V1\/2 and k (the slope factor). For \nactivation of the A-current, the peak amplitude from the I\/V was corrected for non-\nlinearity of the single channel current using a modified GHK equation of the form \ni=\u03b1*((F2V)\/(RT))*(([K+]in-[K+]out*e-(FV\/RT))\/(1-e-(FV\/RT))) where symbols have their usual \nmeaning and \u03b1 is a normalisation factor {Clay, 2000 #2}. For comparison of the \nrelative contributions from K+ channels, the chord conductance was used, that is \nG=I\/(V-EK). Exponential fits were performed using Clampfit 9.2 (Molecular Devices) \nor Excel (Microsoft) with least squares minimisation.  \n \n  \nImmunohistochemistry: P13 CBA mice brainstems were frozen in Tissue Tek \n(Sakura) using hexane and dry ice. Unfixed tissue was sectioned, so that antibodies \ncould be tested in four different fixation conditions: the four conditions were: 4% \nparaformaldehyde (PFA), PFA with antigen retrieval, methanol and methanol with \nantigen retrieval. PTA, without antigen retrieval was selected as giving the most \nspecific staining (on the basis of low background; competition by blocking peptide \nand overall staining intensity) for all of the three Kv4 antibodies. This method is \nsimilar to that reported previously {Dodson, 2003 #1; Dodson, 2002 #8}. Cryostat \nsections (12\u00b5m) were mounted on polylysine-coated slides and fixed in 4% \nparaformaldehyde\/PBS for 25min at 4\u00b0C. After washing 3x5 minutes in 100mM PBS \nwith 0.1% Triton X-100 (PBS-T), those slides receiving \u2018antigen retrieval\u2019 were \ntreated with citrate buffer (pH6.0) for 20min at 95\u00b0C. After rewashing in PBS-T, \nsections were blocked with 1% BSA and 1% goat serum in PBS-T for 1h at 20\u02daC and \nthen incubated with anti-Kv4 antibodies (Sources: Kv4.1Ab: Santa Cruz, C-18 Sc-\n16025, 1:100; Kv4.2Ab & Kv4.3Ab, Alomone Labs, APC-023 and APC-017, \nrespectively; at 1:800) in blocking buffer overnight at 4\u00b0C. After washing with PBS-T, \nthe secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit Alexa-fluor488, Molecular Probes, 1:1000) \nwas applied for 2hr at 20\u02daC, then mounted with Vectashield (Vector Labs., \nPeterborough UK). Images were obtained using a Leica fluorescence microscope \n(DM2500) fitted with a CCD camera (Leica, DFC350Fx). Control sections underwent \nidentical procedures, but in the presence of blocking peptide. \n \nSolutions and drugs: All chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, UK ( except: \nTTx (Latoxan, Blum France), dendrotoxin-I (Alomone, Jerusalem Israel), ZD7288 \n(Tocris Cookson, Bristol UK), and Alexa-fluor (goat-anti-rabbit) (Molecular Probes, \nInvitrogen, Paisley UK). Hanatoxin was a kind gift from Dr. K Swartz [NINDS, NIH, \nUSA). \n \nModelling:  Isolated A-currents were fit (by minimising the sum of the squared error \nusing Matlab (The Mathworks Inc, USA) with a Hodgkin-Huxley model of the form, \n \nI = A * GHK(v) * m4 * z      (equation 1) \n \nwhere A dictated the magnitude of the conductance (and was a free parameter of the \nfit), GHK specified the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz dependence on voltage, m was the \nactivation variable, z was the inactivation variable and v was voltage.  \n \nFor a voltage step from a negative voltage (assuming no activation and complete \nremoval of inactivation) equation 1 took the form, \n \nI = A * GHK * ((minf(1\/4) * (1-exp(-t\/mtau)))4  \n* (zinf-(zinf-1) * (exp(-t\/zhtau)))    (equation 2) \n \nWhere minf was the steady-state activation and zinf was the steady-state inactivation \n(both given by the Boltzman fits shown in Figure 1B), mtau was the time constant of \nactivation and ztau was the time constant of inactivation (both free parameters in the \nfit) and t was time. The values of mtau and ztau are given in Table 1.  \n \n \n(Table 1 should appear near here) \n \n \nThe single-compartment MNTB model {Macica, 2003 #40} obtained from Model DB \n{Hines, 2004 #41} was manipulated using the NEURON simulation software {Hines, \n2001 #32}. The reversal potential of the leak current, and therefore the resting \nmembrane potential, was set to -80mV and the A-current model was incorporated. \nSynaptic currents were constructed using a reversal potential of 0 mV and were of \nthe form: \n \nI = B * Ga * (v \u2013 0) + C* Gb * (v-0)    (equation 3) \n \nWhere v was voltage, G was conductance and B (and C) were given by, \n \nX =  s * (exp(-t\/taux2) \u2013 exp(-t\/taux1))  (X = B or C)  (equation 4) \n \nWhere s was a scaling factor set to normalise the maximum of X to 1, taux1 was the \nrise time constant, taux2 was the decay time constant and t was time. G, taux1 and \ntaux2 are given in Table 2. \n \n(Table 2 should appear near here) \n \nResults \nWhole-cell patch clamp recordings were made from visually identified MNTB \nneurones from P10-14 mice. Outward K+ currents were measured under voltage-\nclamp conditions in the presence of tetraethylammonium (TEA) and dendrotoxin-I \n(DTx-I) to block Kv3 and Kv1 currents, respectively {Brew, 1995 #7; Dodson, 2002 \n#8; Wang, 1998 #23}.  Under these conditions a transient outward current was \nobserved upon depolarization to -17mV (Figure 1A, black square), provided a \nconditioning hyperpolarizing voltage step (to remove inactivation) preceded this test \ndepolarization. The amplitude of the transient outward current, at -17mV, was 1.07 \u00b1 \n0.15nA (n=8, from a conditioning voltage step to -117 mV, grey trace). This current \ninactivated rapidly, characteristic of an A-type potassium current {Connor, 1971 #33}. \nSteady-state inactivation was determined by stepping the conditioning voltage from -\n117 to -37mV and measuring the current evoked at \u201317 mV (Figure 1A, black \nsquare). The inactivation data were normalized and fit with a Boltzmann function \n(Figure 1B, filled squares) with a half-inactivation (V1\/2in) of \u201376.9\u00b10.9mV and a slope \nfactor (kin) of 7.0\u00b10.3 (n=9).  \nActivation was measured by comparing currents evoked during two test \nprotocols shown in Figure 1C.  Each test voltage (T1 & T2) was preceded by \nhyperpolarisation to -117mV (to remove inactivation) but in T2, the A-current was \ninactivated by a pre-pulse to -37mV for 20ms. Subtraction of the T2 currents from the \nT1 currents gave the isolated A-current, shown in Figure 1D. The peak A-current was \nmeasured, adjusted to account for GHK rectification (see methods) and normalized \n(Figure 1B, closed circles).  The activation data were fit with a Boltzmann function \nwith a half-activation (V1\/2ac) of -35.0\u00b11.3mV and slope factor (kac) \u20136.7\u00b10.3, (Figure \n1B, filled circles, n=9).  At positive voltages rectification was observed, consistent \nwith voltage-dependant block by [Mg2+]i {Forsythe, 1992 #9; Slesinger, 1993 #12} so \nthese points were excluded from the fit.  \nThe isolated A-currents inactivated with a single exponential time-constant of \n6.28\u00b10.77ms (at -17 mV, n=7). To assess the rate of recovery from inactivation, a \ndouble pulse protocol was used, in which two -17mV pulses were separated by a \nvariable recovery period, as shown in Figure 1E. The A-current recovered completely \nin less than 50ms with a single-exponential time course of \u03c4 = 16.4\u00b11.6ms (n=8).  \nIn 5 neurones from older animals (P18-19) the peak A-current at -17mV was \nsimilar to data obtained at P10-P14, with an amplitude of 1.2\u00b10.15nA (n=5). \nInactivation Boltzmann parameters were also similar (k = 7.6, V1\/2in = -77.2, n=5) and \nthe inactivation time constant measured at -17 mV was not significantly different \nbetween the two age groups (tau = 7.7 ms, p=0.23). \n \nPharmacology of the A-current \nKv1, Kv3 and Kv4 potassium channel families possess subunits with A-type \ncharacteristics {Coetzee, 1999 #6}.  We used a pharmacological approach to dissect \nwhich subunits mediated the A-current observed here. Kv3 channels are eliminated \nsince they are all sensitive to micromolar concentrations of TEA {Rudy, 2001 #18} \nand the A-current was still present in 100mM TEA (substituted for NaCl, n=3, Figure \n2A).  \nAlthough Kv1 channels are largely insensitive to millimolar concentrations of \nTEA, our recordings were made in the presence of dendrotoxin-I, which blocks Kv1 \ncurrents in MNTB neurones {Brew, 1995 #7; Dodson, 2002 #8}. It is theoretically \nconceivable that DTx-insensitive Kv1 channels composed of Kv1.3 or Kv1.4 could \nform an inactivating outward current. However CP 339,818 (5-10\u03bcM), an antagonist \nof Kv1.3 and Kv1.4 channels {Jager, 1998 #14; Nguyen, 1996 #13}, had no effect on \nthe A-current (n=3, data not shown, recorded in TEA & DTx-I).  \nKv4 subunits are resistant to TEA and are blocked by 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) \n{Coetzee, 1999 #6}. The A-current in the MNTB was largely blocked by 4-AP as \nshown in Figure 2B (5-10mM, n= 4, in the presence of TEA & DTx-I). Furthermore, \nlocal pressure ejection of 5 \u03bcM hanatoxin from a puffer pipette reduced the maximum \nA-current measured at -17 mV by 68 \u00b1 13% (Figure 2C, n=4). Hanatoxin selectively \nshifts the voltage-dependence of Kv4 (and Kv2.1) activation to more positive voltages \n{Swartz, 1995 #19}. Together these data are consistent with mediation of the MNTB \nA-current by Kv4 channels. \n \nKv4.3 protein is expressed in the MNTB \nKv4 subunits classically mediate A-type K+ currents {Birnbaum, 2004 #5}. To \nexamine the expression of Kv4 subunits in the MNTB we used well-characterised \nantibodies against the three family members: Kv4.1, Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 {Amberg, 2002 \n#4; Kollo, 2006 #3}. There was robust staining above the blocking peptide control for \nKv4.3, whereas staining for Kv4.2 was only just above background (Figure 3). \nSimilar to other Kv subunits, the Kv4.3 staining shows significant cytoplasmic \nstaining with some indication of membrane localisation (Figure 3X, arrow) [add \ncorrect figure ref]. The presence of Kv4.3 is consistent with reports of Kv4.3 in situ \nhybridization in the MNTB {Lein, 2007 #39}. No specific staining above background \nwas observed for Kv4.1, consistent with Kv4.1 only being expressed in the olfactory \nbulb and CA1 of the hippocampus {Fitzakerley, 2000 #15; Serodio, 1998 #16}.  \n \nSpecies differences \nAlthough we found an A-current in every neurone tested in mouse MNTB (>30 cells), \nwe did not detect an A-current in any of 6 MNTB neurones tested in the rat (Figure \n2D). This finding is consistent with previous independent reports from mouse {Brew, \n2003 #10} and rat {Dodson, 2002 #8}. \n \nPhysiological role  \nTo investigate the physiological role of the A-current present in MNTB principal \nneurones, current clamp recordings were made before and after application of 5\u03bcM \nhanatoxin (which reduces the magnitude of the A-current at physiologically relevant \nvoltages; see above). Action potentials were elicited by injection of depolarising \ncurrent steps from holding potentials of -67 and -77 mV (chosen to reduce A-current \ninactivation), and AP characteristics (threshold, half-width and latency) were \nmeasured. However, no significant changes or trends in AP characteristics were \nobserved between control and hanatoxin treated cells [correct Jamie?] (n=3, all \np>0.05; paired t-tests).  \n \nThe A-current is small relative to the magnitude of other K+ currents in the MNTB; \nwhen inactivation is removed by a hyperpolarising pre-pulse, there is a maximum A-\ncurrent of ~10 nS available (calculated at \u201317mV) versus more than 55 nS from the \nother outward K+ currents (calculated at 13mV).  At resting membrane potentials the \nA-current is more than half-inactivated (Figure 1B), reducing its contribution to the \noverall outward conductance. So combined with its rapid time-course, the \ninfluence this A-current can exert on shaping the voltage response is likely to be \nsubtle and was difficult to resolve from direct patch recording. Therefore, we \nused a modelling approach to test its contribution to MNTB neurone excitability. A \nHodgkin-Huxley model was fit to isolated A-currents (Figure 4A) and the mean time \nconstants for activation and inactivation, obtained from 5 such fits (see Table 1), \nwere used to produce the final model MNTB A-current (Figure 4B). This was added \nto a single-compartment model (containing high and low voltage-activated potassium \ncurrents), which captures salient features of MNTB AP firing {Macica, 2003 #40; \nSong, 2005 #44; Wang, 1998 #23}. \n \nThe membrane potential response to a simulated 200 Hz train of 20 large synaptic \ncurrents (simulating transmitter release from the pre-synaptic Calyx of Held; see \nmethods) is shown in Figure 5A. Data from the full model is shown in black, whereas \nthe grey trace represents the voltage following complete removal of the A-current \nfrom the model. In response to this \u201ccalyceal\u201d stimulus, APs were generated in \nresponse to each synaptic event and appeared qualitatively similar in the presence or \nabsence of the A-current. The first AP (Figure 5B) was narrower when the model \nincluded an A-current but this effect declined with each AP and was negligible by the \nlast AP in a train, consistent with inactivation of the A-current (Figure 5C). This \nprediction was verified using patch recording, by evoking APs in response to 200Hz \ntrains of current pulses (each having a synaptic waveform). The average response to \na minimum of 10 stimuli were used to reduce noise. Under these conditions the first \nAP was found to have a halfwidth 30\u00b15\u03bcs shorter than the second AP (n=4, p=0.01, \ndata not shown).  \n \nPrincipal neurones in the MNTB also receive synaptic stimulation that is sub-\nthreshold (or around threshold) particularly from non-calyceal inputs {Hamann, 2003 \n#24}. We reasoned that the A-current would have a more significant effect on MNTB \nAP firing in response to stimulation that was just above threshold for AP firing. The \nslower time-course and small amplitude of the non-calyceal inputs would allow more \nof the A-current to activate before APs are generated. The MNTB model suggested \nthat the A-current could influence AP firing in response to a non-calyceal synaptic \nstimulus (see methods; compare Figures 5D & E) despite the small magnitude of the \nA-current (Figure 5F), but this proved difficult to test in native neurons due to the \nvariability induced by trial to trial quantal fluctuation.      \n   \n \nDiscussion \nWe have characterised a transient outward current in principal neurones of the \nMNTB. The kinetics and biophysical properties of this A-current are consistent with \nthe Kv4 voltage-gated K+ channel family {Birnbaum, 2004 #5}. The pharmacology of \nthe current, being insensitive to CP 339,818 and high concentrations of TEA, but \nblocked by 4-AP and hanatoxin is also consistent with data from recombinant Kv4 \nchannels. Of the three Kv4 subunits, Kv4.3 exhibits significant in situ hybridization in \nthe MNTB {Lein, 2007 #39} and antibodies to this subunit show robust labelling in \nprincipal neurones of the MNTB. It is likely that the channels mediating the fast A-\ncurrent are predominantly composed of Kv4.3 subunits, perhaps with a minor \ncontribution from Kv4.2, based on the low level staining (Figure 3).   \n \nThe immunohistochemistry showed strong cytoplasmic labelling of Kv4.3, consistent \nwith consistent with protein synthesis, trafficking or presence in other internal \norganelles. Some concentrations of Kv4.3 staining were also observed associated \nwith the plasma membrane. In the hippocampus Kv4 currents are more highly \nexpressed in dendritic rather than somatic compartments, where they participate in \nsynaptic plasticity {Johnston, 2003 #38}, MNTB neurones do possess small \ndendrites, but no specific staining of neuronal processes was observed. \n \nA characteristic of this MNTB A-current is its rapid rate of inactivation, showing time-\nconstants of less than 10ms and fast recovery. This contrasts with heterogolously \nexpressed Kv4.3 subunits which have inactivation time constants of ~60-100ms \n{Nadal, 2003 #41; Wang, 2002 #40}. In general, A-currents of native neurons tend to \nhave faster inactivation rates, although there is considerable variability between brain \nregions.  Some have time-constants longer than 30ms; e.g. Locus coeruleus \n{Forsythe, 1992 #9}; VCN {Rothman, 2003 #35} and cortical pyramidal neurones \n{Yuan, 2005 #36}. Whereas, cerebellar granule neurons {Bardoni, 1993 #43} have \nsimilar rates to those in the MNTB.  It is well established that Kv4 subunits are \nmodulated by a plethora of accessory proteins and biochemical pathways {Birnbaum, \n2004 #5}. Indeed it is likely that the faster kinetics of native A-currents versus their \nheterologously expressed counterparts is due to differences in accessory subunit \nexpression {An, 2000 #37; Birnbaum, 2004 #5; Nadal, 2003 #41; Rhodes, 2004 #42}. \n[deleted and simplified the surrounding sentences] K+ channel interacting proteins \n(KChIP) are key candidates as they co-localise with Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 subunits in the \nmammalian brain {Rhodes, 2004 #42}. Although KChIPs speed recovery from \ninactivation they tend to slow inactivation {Birnbaum, 2004 #5; Wang, 2002 #40}, \nsuggesting that other accessory subunits are required in the mouse MNTB, e.g. \nDPPX {Nadal, 2003 #41} and further work is required. \n \nClassically, A-currents increase inter-spike intervals, slowing firing rates and in the \npresence of suitable hyperpolarizing drive they contribute to oscillating firing {Connor, \n1971 #33; Connor, 1971 #34}. The physiological roles of A-currents vary markedly in \ndifferent parts of the auditory pathway. In the ventral cochlear nucleus the A-current \nmodulates firing rate {Rothman, 2003 #27}, whereas in spiral ganglion neurones the \nA-current is the dominant K+ channel mediating action potential repolarisation \n{Jagger, 2002 #30}. These different roles reflect the varying channel kinetics and \ncurrent densities relative to other K+ channels in each neurone type.  \n  \nMNTB principal neurones express high voltage-activated Kv3 channels that dominate \naction potential repolarisation {Brew, 1995 #7; Klug, 2006 #22; Wang, 1998 #23}. In \ncomparison, the A-current is of relatively small magnitude, so it is not surprising that \nits effects on action potential repolarisation are modest. Indeed both the model and \nour experimental data shows that the A-current makes only a tiny difference on the \naction potential half-width (30\u00b5s).  Nevertheless, such a small change could be \nsignificant for interaural comparison in the mouse, since their interaural distance is \nalso small.  The A-current is largely inactivated during sustained depolarisation but \nmodelling showed that when the preceding membrane potential is hyperpolarised, \nthe A-current can contribute to AP repolarisation during the first few action potentials \nof a train. At resting membrane potentials (-60 to \u201370mV) the A-current is more than \nhalf-inactivated. However, membrane hyperpolarisations of around 10mV raise the \navailable A-current by ~2 fold (see Figure 1B). Such hyperpolarisations may occur \nafter high frequency stimulation (as observed in the pre-synaptic terminal {Kim, \n2007 #25}) or during inhibitory synaptic transmission. Indeed, with development, the \nMNTB receives a strong (~200nS) glycinergic input {Awatramani, 2004 #11}, the role \nof which has yet to be determined. [Jamie \u2013 this is a bit repetitive of what has now \nbeen said elsewhere at the end of the results section so lets delete it here - Our \nmodelling suggests that, since the A-current begins to activate just below action \npotential threshold (which is -51.4 \u00b11.6mV, n=8), a plausible mechanism for \nphysiological activation of the A-current would be during integration of the small non-\ncalyceal inputs {Hamann, 2003 #24}.] \n \nAn interesting limitation to the physiological function of this A-current is the \nrectification observed at positive membrane potentials. This is strongly reminiscent of \nvoltage-dependent block by internal Mg2+ observed in unitary A-current channels \n{Forsythe, 1992 #9} and ShkB channels {Slesinger, 1993 #12}) and will limit the \nmagnitude of the A-current at the peak of the action potential.  \n \nA previous study reported a small 4-aminopyridine-sensitive A-current in mouse \n{Brew, 2003 #10}. However, there is no evidence for an A-current in the rat (Figure \n2D) {Brew, 1995 #7; Dodson, 2002 #8}, suggesting an interesting species difference. \nIt is difficult to speculate about the reasons for this species difference given that there \nis little information regarding binaural auditory processing in the mouse or rat \n(although sound localisation for free field stimuli has been investigated {Heffner, 1985 \n#45; Heffner, 1988 #47; Ehret, 1984 #48}). Based on the observations made here, \nthe A-current would contribute to AP repolarisation at the onset of a sound stimulus, \nparticularly following a hyperpolarising drive to MNTB neurones. In addition, it may \ncontribute to integration of non-calyceal input to the MNTB, the origin and function of \nwhich are unknown. Therefore, the significance of this A-current for auditory \nprocessing in the mouse remains a question for further investigation. \n \nAcknowledgements: Thanks to Kenton Swartz for the kind gift of purified hanatoxin. \nThis work was funded by the Medical Research Council; JJ was an MRC PhD \nScholar. \n \nAbbreviations: aCSF, artificial cerebrospinal fluid; AP, action potential; 4-AP, 4-\naminopyridine; DTx-I, dendrotoxin-I; TEA, tetraethylammonium; HaTx, hanatoxin; \nMNTB, medial nucleus of the trapezoid body; VCN, ventral cochlear nucleus. \n \nReferences \n Voltage (mV) mtau (ms) ztau (ms) N \n-37 0.62 10.01 2 \n-27 0.46 7.10 5 \n-17 0.41 5.79 5 \n-7 0.36 4.75 5 \n3 0.33 3.58 5 \n13 0.24 2.47 2 \n \nTable 1.
