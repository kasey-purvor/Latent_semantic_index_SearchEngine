Introduction\nCancer cells depend on sufficient nutrient supply for survival and, therefore, growth of a\n(solid) tumour requires access to blood vessels. Cancer cells can also acquire an invasive\nphenotype enabling them to enter the circulation and eventually establish metastases. Thus,\nthe onset of angiogenesis (the process by which new vessels are generated from existing\nones) appears to mark the transition of a solid tumour from a mostly harmless, localised\nlesion into a potentially fatal, systemic disease. In this context, antiangiogenic drugs were\nanticipated to provide a breakthrough in anticancer therapy. In spite of the high expectations\nraised by early successes in animal experiments, these drugs have fared poorly in clinical\ntrials. When administered alone, antiangiogenic drugs achieve modest objective responses\nbut their impact on life expectancy and long-term survival has been disappointingly poor (see\n[14] and references therein).\nComputational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine\nISSN 1748-670X print\/ISSN 1748-6718 online q 2006 Taylor & Francis\nhttp:\/\/www.tandf.co.uk\/journals\nDOI: 10.1080\/10273660600968994\n*Corresponding author.

For example, a drug called bevacizumab, an antibody against a potent\nangiogenic substance secreted (among others) by cancer cells called vascular endothelial\ngrowth factor (VEGF), in combination with cytotoxic drugs yielded a significant increase in\nsurvival in colorectal cancer patients [18]. These results support the predictions of Teicher\n[29], who anticipates that the combination of antigiogenic drugs with conventional\nchemotherapy would yield optimal effects, as this combination targets two tumour\ncompartments (cancer cells and endothelial cells). According to Teicher [29], antiangiogenic\ndrugs should always increase the effects of cytotoxic drugs.\nThese observations can be considered somehow paradoxical, as, in principle,\nantiangiogenic therapy removes (or prevents formation of) tumour blood vessels, thereby\ndisabling the access route the cytotoxic drugs use to reach the tumour [14]. Thus, it could be\nexpected that less drug would reach the tumour reducing its overall cell killing effect.\nEssentially, the same could be expected for radiotherapy. Antiangiogenic therapy would\nremove blood vessels which, in turn, would produce extensive areas of hypoxia (low oxygen\nlevels) within the tumour. Furthermore, hypoxia is known to antagonise radiation therapy. In\nfact, there exist studies showing that antiangiogenic therapy may compromise the outcomes\nof both chemo- and radio-therapy [14].\nThe mechanisms by which antiangiogenic therapy improve cytotoxic drug efficiency are\nnot completely understood. However, work by Jain et al. [14,30,32] provides strong evidence\nto support the involvement of antiangiogenic therapy-induced vessel normalization which\nmay be explained as follows. Tumour vasculature is known to exhibit a number of\nabnormalities in comparison to its normal counterpart. Normal vasculature has a well-\ndefined anatomical structure essential for its functionality. Tumour vessels are usually\nimmature and lack this structure. Consequently, they are leaky and not quiescent, unlike\nnormal vessels. Additionally, immature tumour vessels are prone to collapse under the\npressure of the growing tumour population. These structural abnormalities yield, in turn,\nabherrant blood flow and oxygen delivery with spatial and temporal heterogeneities. These\nfeatures combine to produce an abnormal micro-environment in which increased hypoxia\n(low levels of oxygen), which renders cells resistant to chemo- and radio-therapy, and\nabherrant tumour blood flow, pose severe barriers to drug delivery and efficacy [12].\nIn this context, it seems that fixing (i.e. normalising) the tumour vasculature could help to\nre-establish normal delivery of drugs and oxygen thus allowing more cancer cells to receive\neffective concentrations of both. This is the rationale behind normalisation strategies.\nAngiogenesis, in both pathological and physiological situations, is controlled by an increase\nin angiogenic promoters (e.g. VEGF) over their inhibitor counterparts. In normal conditions,\nthis imbalance will eventually be counterbalanced. In a pathological setting, the imbalance\npersists. Therefore, restoring the balance using antiangiogenic substances may result in a\nmore normal-looking vasculature. However, excessive doses of antiangiogenic drugs may\nhinder the effect of conventional therapy. It has been observed in several studies that\nantiangiogenic therapies antagonise chemo- or radio-therapy by reducing oxygenation and\ndrug delivery. This indicates that there is a delicate balance between normalisation and\n(excessive) vessel regression, implying that extreme care is needed in the selection of dose\nand schedule [14].\nRecent modelling work addressing the effect of vessel dematuration on tumour growth was\nrecently presented in Ref. [4]. A cellular automaton model was developed to analyse the\neffect of the growing tumour on the vasculature which was incorporated with simple models\nT. Alarco\u00b4n et al.86\nof angiogenesis, vessel co-option and vessel collapse (as a consequence of vessel\ndematuration). Bartha and Rieger [4] concluded that vascular density might not be an\nappropriate indicator of tumour prognosis, as is generally believed. Instead, their model\nsuggests that tumour progression, at least in its early stages, is strongly determined by the\nvascular density of the original host tissue.\nIn Ref. [25] Ribba et al. incorporated a model of vessel dematuration upon co-option by\nthe growing tumour into a model designed to assess typical clinical protocols of doxorubicin\ntreatment of Non-Hodgkin lymphomas. The dematuration model used in Ref. [25] was\nextremely simple: whenever a vessel was co-opted by the tumour its radius would be\nassigned a value drawn from a randomly generated Gaussian distribution. The rationale for\nthis model was that when a vessel is co-opted a process is triggered whereby the normal\nmechanisms dictating vessel behaviour cease to act. In this context, assigning a random value\nto the radii of co-opted vessels might be a reasonable first approximation. However, this\nmodel did not incorporate any of the mechanisms of vessel dematuration upon engulfment.\nIn addition, a thorough investigation of the effects of vessel dematuration was not carried out.\nAlthough Teicher [29] appears to have reached the right conclusion, her \u201clinear\u201d\nreasoning, which is typical of attempts by biologists to establish a non-quantitative\ntheoretical framework [9], neglects many of the complex interactions between the different\nelements involved in the process of tumour growth. Our aim in this paper is to place Teicher\u2019s\ntheoretical ideas in a quantitative framework which allows us first to check their validity and\nthen to explore possible mechanisms involved in the improvement of the efficacy of\ncytotoxic drugs administered together with antiangiogenic drugs. This will be done by\nadapting the multiscale model of vascular tumour growth developed by us [1,3,5] to allow for\nvessel dematuration upon co-option by a growing tumour.\nThis paper is organised as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of the multiscale\nframework used in this paper. Section 3 summarises results presented previously in Ref. [16]\nwhich help us to understand the new results reported in this paper. In section 4 we compare\nthe responses of tumours with normal and cancerous vasculatures to treatment with cytotoxic\ndrug. In section 5 we summarise the biological background to tumour-induced vessel\ndematuration and explain how we incorporate this phenomenon within our multiscale\nframework. In section 6, we present simulation results that illustrate how a tumour\u2019s\nevolution depends on whether the underlying vasculature is normal or pathological and\nwhether vessel dematuration occurs. In section 7, we investigate the effect of treating a\ntumour with a combination of chemotherapy and an anti-VEGF receptor antibody which\nantagonises VEGF and the effect that it has on the outcome of chemotherapy. Finally, in\nsection 8 we discuss our results, model limitations and future research directions.\n2. Summary of the multiscale model\nIn this section, we describe briefly the elements and organisation of the multiscale model.\nThis framework has been described in detail in Ref. [3,5]. We refer the reader to these\nprevious papers for a thorough account of the model formulation.\nOur model is based on the hybrid cellular automaton concept which has been used to\nmodel several aspects of tumour development (see [1,6,21]). We extend this approach to\naccount not only for the presence of a diffusive substance (such as oxygen or glucose) as in\nprevious papers, but also to include intracellular and tissue-scale phenomena, and the\ncoupling between them. To this end, we have organised our model into three layers: vascular,\nMultiscale modelling of tumour growth and therapy 87\ncellular and intracellular, which correspond, respectively, to the tissue, cellular and\nintracellular TLSs (figures 1 and 2).\nIn the tissue layer, we deal with the structural properties of the vascular network and blood\nflow [1]. We consider a hexagonal vascular network (similar to the one observed in liver).\nEach vessel is assumed to undergo structural adaptation (i.e. changes in radius) in response to\ndifferent stimuli until the network reaches a quasi-equilibrium state. We then compute the\nblood flow rate, the pressure drop and the haematocrit (i.e. relative volume of red blood cells)\ndistribution in each vessel. The dynamics of the vascular layer and the cellular layer are\ncoupled by the transport of blood-borne oxygen into the tissue. This process is modelled by a\nreaction\u2013diffusion equation. The distribution of haematocrit in the vessels acts as the source\nof oxygen, whereas the cell distribution defines the (spatially distributed) sink of oxygen.\nmolecular events\n(ion channel gating)\n10\u20133 m\nTissueProtein\n10\u20139 m\nAtom\n10\u201312 m 10\u20136 m\nCell\ndiffusion\ncell signalling\n10\u20136 s 10\u20133 s 100 s 103 s\nmitosis\nFigure 1.

Diagrammatic representation of the layer structure of our model.\nT. Alarco\u00b4n et al.88\nIn the cellular layer, we focus on normal and cancer cells which are treated as individual\nelements. These two populations compete for space and resources. Competition between the\ntwo cell types is introduced by a simple rule, which couples the cellular to the intracellular\nlayer. Apoptosis (programmed cell death) is controlled by the expression of p53 (whose\ndynamics are dealt with in the intracellular layer): when the level of p53 in a cell exceeds\nsome threshold the cell undergoes apoptosis. However, this threshold depends on the local\nspatial distribution of cells, which links the spatial distribution (cellular layer) with the\napoptotic process (intracellular layer).\nProcesses included in the intracellular layer are cell division, apoptosis and VEGF\nsecretion. In this layer, we use ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to model the relevant\nbiochemistry. One issue we focus on is how the external conditions modulate the dynamics of\nthese intracellular phenomena and, in particular, how the level of extracellular oxygen affects\nthe division rate, the expression of p53 (which regulates apoptosis) and the production of\nVEGF. Since the spatial distribution of oxygen depends on both the spatial distribution of\ncells (cellular layer) and on the distribution of haematocrit (vascular layer), these processes at\nthe intracellular level are linked to the behaviour of the other two layers: cell proliferation\nand apoptosis alter the spatial distribution of the cells (figure 2); the cellular and intracellular\nlayers modulate the process of vascular structural adaptation through another transport\nprocess: diffusion of VEGF into the tissue and its absorption by the endothelial cells (ECs)\nlining the vessels.\nSince the main focus of this paper is on vessel normalisation, brief mathematical\ndescriptions of the cellular and intracellular layers are presented in the Appendix while a\ndetailed description of the vascular layer is given in section 3.\n3. Structural adaptation in normal and cancerous vasculature\nPries et al. have constructed a model [23,24] in which normal vessels adapt their radii in\nresponse to a number of different stimuli. In a vessel of radius R\u00f0t\u00de we have:\ndR\ndt\n\u00bc StotR \u00f01\u00de\nwhere Stot is the total stimulus, corresponding to the sum of the different stimuli which we\ndescribe briefly now.\nFirst there is the haemodynamic stimulus, Sh, through which the vessels adapt to blood\nflow conditions. The main signals involved here appear to be wall shear stress (WSS), tw, and\npressure, P [26], with increased WSS typically increasing the vessel radius and increased\npressure decreasing it [24]. Accordingly, Pries et al. [24] postulate the following form for the\nhaemodynamic stimulus, Sh:\nSh \u00bc log\u00f0tw \u00fe tr\u00de2 kplog\u00f0te\u00f0P\u00de\u00de \u00f02\u00de\nwhere tr is a constant introduced to avoid singular behaviour for low WSS, kp is a constant\nand te\u00f0P\u00de is a set-point level of WSS corresponding to the actual value of the intravascular\npressure [24].\nThe second stimulus is the so-called metabolic stimulus (Sm) which describes how vessels\nadapt to the metabolic needs of the surrounding tissue. Pries et al. [23] considered the\nMultiscale modelling of tumour growth and therapy 89\nfollowing functional form for Sm:\nSm \u00bc kmlog 1 \u00fe\n_Qr\n_QH\n\u0001 \u0002\n\u00f03\u00de\nwhere km is a constant, _Qr is a reference blood flow and H is the haematocrit. In Ref. [3], a\nmodification of equation (3) was proposed to account for the effect that VEGF, V, has on the\nvasculature (VEGF is produced by nutrient-deprived cells). In Ref. [3], the constant km was\nreplaced by a function of V:\nkm\u00f0V\u00de \u00bc k0m 1 \u00fe\nV\nV0 \u00fe V\n\u0001 \u0002\n\u00f04\u00de\nwhere k0m and V0 are constants.\nThe third stimulus is actually a pair of stimuli, the so-called conducted stimuli, and\nconsists of signals generated by the vessels that propagate either downstream or upstream.\nThey are assumed to be necessary to maintain a fully functional vascular system. These\nsignals are usually emitted under stress conditions, and therefore are closely related to the\nmetabolic stimulus described above. Although many underlying biological details of these\nsignalling mechanisms are unknown, the downstream stimulus is believed to be transmitted\nby a chemical which is released into the blood (a good candidate seems to be ATP released\nby red blood cells under hypoxic conditions) and thereby carried downstream by the flow.\nThe upstream transmission of information seems to be along the vessel walls, perhaps by the\nspread of changes in membrane potential through gap junctions [24].\nThe intensity of the downstream stimulus, Sd, is assumed to depend on the current of the\nsignalling chemical along a particular vessel (vessel \u201c1\u201d, say). If the vessels upstream\n(vessels \u201c2\u201d and \u201c3\u201d) of vessel 1 are irrigating hypoxic regions, they will receive signals\nfrom the tissue in the form of secreted VEGF. If the concentration of VEGF in vessel 2 or\n3 is positive, then it will produce a (constant) amount of signalling chemical, r 0. The\nchemical will enter vessel 1 and its current along vessel 1 will be (due to mass\nconservation):\nJ1 \u00bc r1\u00f0V\u00de _Q1 \u00fe r2\u00f0V\u00de _Q2 \u00f05\u00de\nwhere ri\u00f0V\u00de \u00bc r0 if V \u2013 0 in vessel i \u00bc 1; 2 and ri\u00f0V\u00de \u00bc 0 if V \u00bc 0 in vessel i \u00bc 1; 2.\nFollowing [24], we write:\nSd \u00bc log 1 \u00fe J1_Q\u00fe _Qref\n\u0001 \u0002\n\u00f06\u00de\nwhere _Qref is a constant introduced to avoid singular behaviour.\nThe upstream stimulus, Su, is assumed to depend on a signal produced by vessels in\nhypoxic regions (V . 0). The \u201camount\u201d of signal produced is assumed to be proportional to\nthe length of the vessel, Ls. As in Ref. [24], we further assume that the upstream signal\ndissipates as it propagates, modelling this process with exponential decay. At a given node\nof the network, the current of upstream stimulus produced by each \u201coutgoing\u201d vessel\nT. Alarco\u00b4n et al.90\n(defined as one such that the corresponding current has a negative value) is given by:\nJ0c \u00bc Lse2Ls=L \u00f07\u00de\nwhere L is a constant.\nThe total current, Jc, is the sum over all the outgoing vessels at a given node of the\ncorresponding values of J0c. The upstream stimulus at each of the incoming vessels at the\ncorresponding node is given by Ref. [24]:\nSu \u00bc kmkc Jc\nJc \u00fe J0 \u00f08\u00de\nwhere J0 is a constant and km \u00bc km\u00f0V\u00de as in equation (4).\nCombining the above assumptions we deduce that the total stimulus, Stot, is given by\nStot \u00bc Sh \u00fe Sm \u00fe Sd \u00fe Su 2 ks \u00f09\u00de\nwhere Sh, Sm, Sd and Su are defined by equations (2)\u2013(8) and ks is a constant corresponding to\nthe so-called shrinking stimulus, which, according to [23], corresponds to the tendency of\nvessels to shrink in the absence of growth factors or other external stimuli.\nThe above stimuli together account for many functional and structural properties of\nnormal vascular networks [24]. Tumour vessels, in contrast, are far from normal. The well-\ndefined anatomical structure and orderly spatial distribution of normal vessels, that produce\nan efficient and functional vascular system, are replaced by leaky vessels that lack most of\nthe anatomical features of their normal counterparts and exhibit a more random-looking\nspatial distribution of vessels. This yields more unstructured and inefficient vascular\nnetworks. In this context, it would be useful to know which, if any, of the adaptation\nmechanisms mentioned above for normal vessels are likely to be active and which are absent\nin cancer vessels.\nThis issue was studied by Maini et al. in Ref. [16]. The strategy there was to \u201cdeconstruct\u201d\nthe normal vasculature, deactivating in turn each of the stimuli affecting adaptation in normal\nvessels. Using our multiscale model, tumour growth was simulated for a range of structural\nadaptation mechanisms and the results compared with qualitative structural features known\nto be exhibited by solid tumours. Based on this study, we concluded that the conducted\nstimuli are most likely to be absent in tumour vasculature [16]. In view of these results, a\nvasculature for which Stot \u00bc Sh \u00fe Sm \u00fe Sd \u00fe Su 2 ks will hereafter be referred to as normal\nwhereas a vasculature for which Stot \u00bc Sh \u00fe Sm 2 ks will be referred to as cancerous.\n3.1 Simulation results: normal and cancerous vasculatures\nBefore considering the effect of therapy, it is useful to present simulations showing how the\ndifferent structural adaptation mechanisms affect the growth properties of our model tumours\n[16]. Figures 3\u20135 show results for tumours perfused by normal and cancerous vasculatures.\nThere are two interesting features to note. One concerns the size of the tumour supported by\nthe vascular networks: being more efficient, the normal vasculature gives rise to a larger\ntumour than its cancerous counterpart. Taken in isolation this result would suggest that\nnormalising the tumour vasculature might not be an efficient therapeutic strategy.\nHowever, figure 5(b) shows a second interesting result, namely the time evolution of the\nnumber of quiescent cancer cells for the normal and cancerous vasculatures. We observe that,\nMultiscale modelling of tumour growth and therapy 91\nFigure 3.

This fact, which is also due to the higher\nefficiency of the normal vasculature, might have important implications for the outcome of\ncombined therapy for the following reasons. In our model, cell quiescence is induced by\nhypoxia\u2020. Since most cytotoxic drugs target proliferating cells and hypoxia is know to delay\n(and even halt) progression through the cell cycle, hypoxia reduces drug efficacy and,\nthereby, contributes to drug resistance. For similar reasons, hypoxic regions are also resistant\nto radiotherapy [14].\nThis result suggests how normalising tumour vessels might improve a tumour\u2019s response\nto chemo- or radio-therapy: by reducing the size of the resistant (quiescent) compartment.\n0.0 100.0 200.0 300.0 400.0 500.0 600.0 700.0\nTime\n0.0\n500.0\n1000.0\n1500.0(a)\nN\num\nbe\nr o\nf P\nro\nlife\nra\ntin\ng \nCa\nnc\ner\n C\nel\nls\n0.0 100.0 200.0 300.0 400.0 500.0 600.0 700.0\nTime\n0.0\n50.0\n100.0\n150.0(b)\nN\num\nbe\nr o\nf Q\nuie\nsc\nen\nt C\nan\nce\nr C\nell\ns\nFigure 5.

Alarco\u00b4n et al.94\nAlthough normalisation could increase the number of proliferating cancer cells, they are\nsusceptible to the cytotoxic drugs and therefore should be destroyed by the chemotherapy.\n4. Simulation results: inclusion of a cytotoxic drug\nAs a first attempt to assess whether vessel normalisation might improve the performance of\nchemotherapeutic agents, we ran simulations of our multiscale model with a blood-borne\ncytotoxic drug as detailed in Section A.4. The cytotoxic drug is administered in the form of\ntwo bolus injections at times t \u00bc 150 and t \u00bc 200. The corresponding results are shown in\nfigures 6 and 7.\nFigures 6(a) and 7(a) show, respectively, the time evolution of the number of proliferating\ncancer cells with and without chemotherapy and for normal and cancerous vasculatures. We\nsee that chemotherapy reduces the number of proliferating cells for both types of vasculature,\nalthough, in agreement with our previous predictions [16], chemotherapy seems to be only\nslightly more effective for the normal vasculature than for the cancerous one. Further, this\ndifference appears to be too small to justify the apparent success of combined\ncytotoxic\/antiangiogenic strategies.\n5. Vessel dematuration\nThe simulations presented in figure 6 do not account for the process of tumour-induced vessel\ndematuration and its dependence on tumour-produced VEGF. The inclusion of some of these\nfeatures into our model is the subject of the present section.\nIt is now widely recognised that tumours interact with the host vasculature. One way in\nwhich they do this is via angiogenesis, a process which has been widely studied by the\ntheoretical community (see the excellent review by Mantzaris et al. [17] and references\n[19,28] for more recent models of angiogenesis including blood flow). With the exception of\n[4], one aspect of tumour\u2013vasculature coupling that has received much less attention is\ntumour-induced vessel dematuration. As tumours grow, \u201chealthy\u201d vessels of the host\norganism are engulfed by the tumour mass and a process of dematuration, which includes\nloss of wall vessel structure and increased leakiness, is triggered [13,33]. Experimental data\nindicate that this process is due to overexpression of a protein called Angiopoietin 2\n(hereafter referred to as Ang2) in the ECs of engulfed vessels. However, the effect of Ang2\non the fate of the engulfed vessels is contextual: if VEGF levels are high, Ang2 contributes to\nincreased sprouting, i.e. it promotes the onset of angiogenesis. If, by contrast, VEGF levels\nare low, Ang2 destabilises the vessels [33].\nIn our simulations, therefore, we now distinguish three types of vessels according to the\nmechanism that controls their structural adaptation. Normal vessels are those surrounded by\na majority of normal cells. They adapt according to the normal total stimulus (see section 3).\nBy contrast, a vessel surrounded by a majority of cancer cells is considered as co-opted or\nengulfed and its behaviour depends on the local concentration of VEGF\u2020.\nMost of the biomolecular details of vessel dematuration are unknown and quantitative\ninformation is scarce. Thus, in order to proceed further, we formulate a rather simple model\nwhich retains what it is currently believed to occur. We introduce a vessel maturity variable,\n\u2020For a discussion of what is meant by the local VEGF concentration of a vessel, see [3].\nMultiscale modelling of tumour growth and therapy 95\n0.0 100.0 200.0 300.0 400.0 500.0\nTime\n0.0\n250.0\n500.0\n750.0\n1000.0(a)\n(b)\n(c)\nN\num\nbe\nr o\nf P\nro\nlife\nra\ntin\ng \nCa\nnc\ner\n C\nel\nls\n0.0 100.0 200.0 300.0 400.0 500.0\nTime\n0.0\n20.0\n40.0\n60.0\n80.0\n100.0\nN\num\nbe\nr o\nf Q\nuie\nsc\nen\nt C\nan\nce\nr C\nell\ns\n0.0 100.0 200.0 300.0 400.0 500.0\nTime\n0.0\n500.0\n1000.0\n1500.0\nN\num\nbe\nr o\nf C\nan\nce\nr C\nel\nls\nT. Alarco\u00b4n et al.96\nM, which characterises the final fate of the vessel in the presence of VEGF: M \u00bc 0\ncorresponds to dematuration, M \u2013 0 corresponds to a normal vessel or to an angiogenic\ntumour vessel.\nSimilar to equation (1), which describes the dynamics of vessel radius in response to\nhaemodynamical and external stimuli, we formulate an equation for the variable M:\ndM\ndt\n\u00bc a\u00f0V 2 Vc\u00deM 2 bM 3 \u00f010\u00de\nwhere a and b are positive constants. The steady state values of M are M1 \u00bc 0 and\nM2 \u00bc \u00f0a\u00f0V 2 Vc\u00de=b\u00de1=2. We note that M1 is unstable and M2 is stable for V . Vc. Hence, for\nV . Vc mature\/angiogenic vessels will be stable whereas immature\/collapsing vessels will\nbe stable for V , Vc, where Vc is the critical concentration of VEGF at which an engulfed\nvessel switches from one status to the other.\nWe assume further that the characteristic timescale for the dynamics of M is much shorter\nthan the structural adaptation timescale, and hence that M is in (quasi-)steady state. This\nassumption allows us to reduce the number of unknown parameters in the model, as, under\nthis assumption, vessel fate is essentially controlled by a single parameter, Vc (equation (10)).\nWe will assume that mature and immature vessels, i.e. vessels with M \u00bc M1 or M \u00bc M2,\nrespectively, undergo structural adaptation according to different stimuli:\ndR\ndt\n\u00bc dM;M1\u00f0Sc 2 h\u00deR\u00fe dM;M2SnR; \u00f011\u00de\nwhere dx;y represents the Kronecker delta and Sn and Sc are the normal and cancerous\nadaptation stimuli, respectively:\nSc \u00bc Sh 2 ks \u00f012\u00de\nSn \u00bc Sh \u00fe Sm 2 ks \u00f013\u00de\nThe parameter h corresponds to the collapse experienced by cancerous vessels under the\npressure of the growing tumour. Such collapse is a consequence of the loss of structural\nstability of the cancerous vessels.\nEquation (11) incorporates the two vascular fates described above. The first term on the\nright hand side corresponds to the low-VEGF behaviour of the engulfed vessels and is\nintended to describe vessel collapse where the change in vessel radius is the product of two\nopposing forces: haemodynamic forces exerted by the blood on the vessel wall (Sc) and\npressure exerted by the tumour cells (h).\nThe second term on the right hand side of equation (11) describes an abnormal vessel (see\nsection 3) in which the metabolic stimulus depends on the local VEGF concentration, thus\naccounting in an effective manner for angiogenic effects.\nFigure 6.

Alarco\u00b4n et al.98\nThe algorithm to determine vessel behaviour is as follows:\ni) All vessels are initially labelled NORMAL.\nii) The numbers of cancer and normal cells within one lattice site distance from the vessel\nare counted. If the former exceed the latter the vessel is termed CO-OPTED, otherwise\nit remains NORMAL. Vessel co-option is reversible, i.e. if this condition ceases to hold,\na co-opted vessel is re-labelled NORMAL.\niii) Normal vessels undergo structural adaptation according to equation (1) with Stot \u00bc\nSh \u00fe Sm \u00fe Sd \u00fe Su 2 ks (see section 3).\niv) Co-opted vessels undergo structural adaptation according to equations (11) and (12)\nwith M\u00f0V\u00de determined by the associated stable steady state solution of equation (10).\n6. Simulation results: normal vasculature vs. dematuration\nHere, we discuss the differences between the behaviour observed in our model under a\nnormal(ised) vasculature and a vasculature generated according to equation (11) and the\neffect that vessel dematuration has on the tumour\u2019s response to cytotoxic drugs.\nFigures 8 and 9 show simulations performed without chemotherapy with a vasculature\ngenerated according to equation (11), i.e. taking into account the effects of vessel\ndematuration as described in section 5. We observe that vessel co-option and dematuration\nlead to the formation of extensive regions populated by quiescent cells (figure 8): these are\nmuch larger than those observed in simulations with a normal vasculature (figure 9(b)). Since\nquiescent cells are, in general, resistant to cytotoxic drugs (which target mostly proliferating\ncells), this could be an important factor for chemotherapy efficacy.\nFigure 9 shows oscillations in both the proliferating and quiescent subpopulations.\nMechanistically, these oscillations are produced by the interplay between vessel engulfment,\nregression and angiogenic response. When vessels are engulfed they initially undergo\nregression under the pressure of the tumour cells. This reduces the oxygen supply, leading to\nhypoxia and cell quiescence. These cells then produce VEGF which causes a switch in vessel\nbehaviour from shrinking to angiogenic. In our model, this induces a local increase in vessel\ndiameter, which enables the cells to recommence their progress through the cell cycle. This\ninterplay between the tumour mass and the vasculature is depicted in figure 10 where the\ndynamics of the vascular network under this rather complex adaptation mechanism is shown.\nFrom these results we conclude that (i) vessel dematuration could be an important factor in\nthe complex dynamical behaviour of tumours, and (ii) the appearance of extensive regions of\nhypoxia might hinder the action of cytotoxic drugs, which act preferentially on proliferating\ncells.\nTo clarify further the role of hypoxic regions populated by quiescent cells, we ran\nsimulations with a cytotoxic drug administered via two bolus injections at times t \u00bc 150 and\nt \u00bc 200 (figures 11 and 12). Figure 12(a),(b) show the time evolution of the total number of\nFigure 7.

We note that the efficacy of the drug deteriorates markedly when the vessels\nundergo co-option and dematuration: in terms of both the total number of cells killed by the\ndrug and the time the cancer needs to recover after the injection, the cytotoxic drug is less\neffective when the vessels are subject to co-option and dematuration.\nFigure 9.

Figure 12(d)\nshows that the numbers of proliferating and quiescent cells drop dramatically after drug\nadministration. However, whereas proliferating cells are killed by the therapy, the reduction\nin quiescent cell numbers, which are immune to the action of the cytotoxic drug, is due to\nquiescent cells starting to proliferate again (note the sudden increase in proliferating cell\nnumbers just after the injections).\nIt is important to point out that the results presented in the section 5 for the \u201ccancerous\nvasculature\u201d differ from those involving vessel dematuration. This difference is due to the\nfact that vessel dematuration acts locally within the network whereas in the cancerous\nvasculature the upstream and downstream stimuli are inactivated over the entire network.\n7.

Alarco\u00b4n et al.104\nthat antiangiogenic therapy, either in the form of an antibody against VEGF or a VEGF\nreceptor blockade, leads to vascular normalisation, i.e. the tumour vasculature, normally\ndisorganised and inefficient, partially recovers and acquires the structure of normal vascular\nbeds. Winkler et al. [32] have conducted experiments in brain tumours in which VEGF\nreceptor 2 (VEGFR2) blockade, by means of a specific antibody against VEGFR2, creates a\nso-called normalisation window, i.e. a period of time during which the vasculature acquires a\nmore normal structure. This partial normalisation improves tumour oxygenation and\nincreases the efficacy of radiation therapy.\nTong et al. [30] have found evidence that vascular normalisation following VEGFR2\nblockade improves the delivery of chemotherapy to the tumour mass by decreasing the\ninterstitial fluid pressure.\n7.1 Anti-VEGFR therapy\nIn order to see whether our model can reproduce the results of Winkler et al. [32] and what\ninsight our model can provide regarding the mechanisms involved, we introduce into our\nmultiscale model a new element, a diffusible anti-VEGFR drug, i.e. a specific antibody\nagainst VEGFR that inhibits the effect of VEGF by competitively binding its receptor. To\nkeep the model as simple as possible, we assume that only ECs have VEGFR. This\nassumption is accurate in normal tissue, but there is some evidence that cancer cells might\nalso respond to VEGF [14].\nThe mathematical description of the anti-VEGFR drug is similar to that used for VEGF\n(Section A.1) and the cytotoxic drug (Section A.4), i.e. a diffusion equation is used to\ndescribe its extracellular concentration R. We will assume that the anti-VEGFR is delivered\nto the tumour via the vasculature. The equation for R takes the form:\n0 \u00bc DR72R2 hR\u00f0Rvess 2 R\u00de2 h0RR2 lRR: \u00f014\u00de\nwhere DR denotes the assumed constant diffusion coefficient of the anti-VEGFR antibody, hR\nthe rate at which it is transported across the vessel wall and h0R is the rate at which VEGF\nbinds to ECs on the surface of the vessel walls. The calculation of the anti-VEGFR\nconcentration within the vascular network, Rvess, is strongly related to the computation of the\nhaematocrit, H (see section 2.1). In particular, we assume that the drug is soluble in plasma\nand, therefore, advected with the liquid fraction of blood, i.e. 12 H. Accordingly, we\nassume that the concentration of drug within each vessel is given by Radm\u00f012 H\u00de where Radm\nis the administered dose. This is analogous to how we model the chemotherapeutic drug.\nThe presence of the anti-VEGFR antibody alters the form of the metabolic stimulus for\nvascular adaptation, in particular the form of equation (4), which assumes a Michaelis\u2013\nMenten kinetics for VEGF binding to the VEGFR on the surface of the ECs. Anti-VEGFR is\na competitive inhibitor of VEGF as it competes for binding to the VEGFR.

Alarco\u00b4n et al.106\n7.2 Simulation results: continuous infusion of anti-VEGFR with no cytotoxic drug\nThe results in figure 13 show that continuous infusion of anti-VEGFR can reduce the size and\ngrowth rate of the tumour. It is not surprising that the larger the value of rA (corresponding to\nan increased ability of the anti-VEGFR to bind the VEGFR), the stronger is the effect of the\ndrug on the tumour. However, the anti-VEGFR antibody does not seem able to completely\neradicate the tumour and therefore as soon as the treatment is removed the tumour will\nregrow.\n7.3 Simulation results: bolus injection of anti-VEGFR\nFigures 14 and 15 show results where a single dose of anti-VEGFR antibody is administered\nbetween t \u00bc 300 and t \u00bc 375 with no cytotoxic drug. We note that a bolus injection of anti-\nVEGFR does not have a significant effect on the size of the tumour (figure 14), although the\nresults are slightly better for higher values of rA. Furthermore, our model seems to be only\npartially successful in reproducing the normalisation window induced by anti-VEGFR in\nexperiments [32]. To assess this, we compare the size of the quiescent (hypoxic)\nsubpopulation upon anti-VEGFR administration with that for untreated dynamics. Figures\n14(a),(b), corresponding to rA \u00bc 1, reveal that the anti-VEGFR therapy has almost no effect\non the size of the quiescent subpopulation. The results corresponding to rA \u00bc 10 are slightly\nbetter: we observe a (modest) reduction in the size of the quiescent subpopulation following\ntreatment with anti-VEGFR (approximately between t \u00bc 400 and t \u00bc 440, see figure 14(d))\n(figure 16).\n0.0 100.0 200.0 300.0 400.0 500.0\nTime\n0.0\n200.0\n400.0\n600.0\n800.0\n1000.0\n1200.0\nN\num\nbe\nr o\nf C\nan\nce\nr C\nel\nls\nFigure 14.

We find that the combined therapy is more efficient than\nchemotherapy alone, both in terms of the percentage of cells killed, K, and the recovery\nperiod, as measured by the time the tumour needs to recover to a 50% of its size prior to\ntreatment (in units of treatment duration) T1=2. The results are summarised in table 1.\nIf the tumour is treated with a cytotoxic drug at t \u00bc 450 (figure 17), i.e. outside the window\nin which the size of the quiescent subpopulation is reduced with respect to the anti-VEGFR-\nuntreated case (figure 14(d)), we find that the anti-VEGFR drug has virtually no effect on the\nresponse to chemotherapy. Thus, we conclude that our model exhibits normalisation-window\nbehaviour.\n250.0 300.0 350.0 400.0 450.0 500.0\nTime\n0.0\n100.0\n200.0\n300.0\n400.0\n500.0\n600.0\n700.0\n800.0(a) (b)\n(c) (d)\nN\num\nbe\nr o\nf P\nro\nlife\nra\ntin\ng \nCa\nnc\ner\n C\nel\nls\n250.0 300.0 350.0 400.0 450.0 500.0\nTime\n0.0\n100.0\n200.0\n300.0\n400.0\n500.0\n600.0\n700.0\n800.0\nN\num\nbe\nr o\nf P\nro\nlife\nra\ntin\ng \nCa\nnc\ner\n C\nel\nls\n250.0 300.0 350.0 400.0 450.0 500.0\nTime\n0.0\n100.0\n200.0\n300.0\n400.0\n500.0\nN\num\nbe\nr o\nf Q\nuie\nsc\nen\nt C\nan\nce\nr C\nell\ns\n250.0 300.0 350.0 400.0 450.0 500.0\nTime\n0.0\n100.0\n200.0\n300.0\n400.0\nN\num\nbe\nr o\nf Q\nuie\nsc\nen\nt C\nan\nce\nr C\nell\ns\nFigure 15.

DR has been taken to have the same value as DV .\nMultiscale modelling of tumour growth and therapy 109\nIn view of these results, we conclude that our model is consistent with recent findings\nregarding the combination of antiangiogenic therapy with cytotoxic drugs and radiotherapy,\nalthough it predicts only minor improvement in cytotoxic drug efficacy. There are several\nreasons for this under-estimation of the efficacy of combined therapy. One of them is very\nlikely to be the fact that angiogenesis is treated implicitly through the VEGF-dependent\nstructural adaptation. However, there are other possibilities, one being related to our model of\nvessel co-option and dematuration. Upon co-option, vessel behaviour is determined by the\nlevel of VEGF: low levels of VEGF lead to vessel collapse whereas high levels yield\nangiogenic vessels. In our model, the transition from one type of behaviour to the other is\ndetermined in terms of the level of VEGF compared to a threshold value, Vc. In the presence\nof an anti-VEGFR drug, it is feasible that higher levels of VEGF are needed to trigger\nangiogenic behaviour or, equivalently, the threshold Vc becomes larger in the presence of\nanti-VEGFR. Detailed modelling of the dependence of Vc on VEGF concentration is beyond\nthe scope of the present work. Instead, we run simulations with increased values of Vc for the\nduration of the anti-VEGFR treatment to assess the effect that this parameter has on the\nbehaviour of the system.\nFrom figure 15 we observe that, although Vc has an effect on the number of cancer cells\nkilled by the anti-VEGFR drug alone, it does not seem to have much influence on the\noutcome of the combined therapy in terms of its effect on tumour size.\n8. Discussion\nIn this paper, we have presented a multiscale model for vascular tumour growth and tumour-\ninduced vessel dematuration. We have used the model to analyse the effect of combined anti-\nangiogenic and cytotoxic therapies.\nUpon co-option by a growing tumour mass, blood vessels undergo a process of\ndematuration, which initially, in the absence of VEGF, induces vessel collapse.

Thus, the results presented in section 6 suggest a more complex scenario than that\nproposed by Teicher [29], in which a combination of antiangiogenic and cytotoxic therapies\nis more efficient than each one on its own because two cancer compartments are targeted.\nOur model suggests a subtle interplay between the dynamics of tumour subpopulations,\noxygen supply and vascular dynamics.\nIn section 7, we introduced into our model an antiangiogenic drug, in particular an\nantibody against the VEGF receptor, which inhibits the effect of VEGF by competitive\n425.0 435.0 445.0 455.0 465.0 475.0\nTime\n0.0\n100.0\n200.0\n300.0\n400.0\nN\num\nbe\nr o\nf Q\nuie\nsc\nen\nt C\nan\nce\nr C\nell\ns\n400.0 410.0 420.0 430.0 440.0 450.0\nTime\n0.0\n100.0\n200.0\n300.0\n400.0\n500.0\nN\num\nbe\nr o\nf Q\nuie\nsc\nen\nt C\nan\nce\nr C\nell\ns\nFigure 18.

This type of therapy has been used in experiments in combination\nwith radio- and chemo-therapy [30,32]. Our model simulations are consistent with these\nreproducing two basic experimental (and clinically-supported) features, namely, the\nimproved efficacy of cytotoxic drugs following treatment with anti-VEGFR drug, and the\nemergence of a window of opportunity, i.e. period of time following treatment with anti-\nVEGFR during which such improvement is possible. Administration of a cytotoxic drug\nbefore or after this window does not improve its impact. The mechanism by which our model\nproduces better therapeutic outcomes when therapies are combined is related to a reduction\nin the size of the quiescent subpopulation, caused by enhanced tumour oxygenation. This\nmechanism is also consistent with experimental observations [32].\nThe mechanism by which our model produces the window of opportunity is due to the\ninterplay between vascular structural adaptation, oxygen supply and the dynamics of the\nsubpopulations of quiescent and proliferating cells. The presence of the anti-VEGFR drug\nproduces extensive hypoxic regions within the tumour, which leads, on the one hand, to\nmassive VEGF production and, on the other, to a certain amount of cell death by oxygen\nstarvation, the extent of which depends, among other factors, on the value of the critical\nVEGF concentration for collapsing-to-angiogenic transition in an engulfed vessel (Vc). The\ngreat amounts of VEGF produced stimulates reorganisation of the vasculature to bring\noxygen to the hypoxic regions. This effect, together with the reduction in oxygen demand\ncaused by cell death, leads to reoxygenation of hypoxic regions and a temporary reduction in\nthe size of the quiescent subpopulation. Eventually, other regions of the tumour become\nhypoxic and blood flow undergoes another period of spatial reorganisation and the window of\nopportunity closes.\nIn spite of good qualitative agreement between our simulations and experimental\nobservations, there are aspects of the model that need to be improved. The mechanism\ndescribed above explaining the appearance of a window of opportunity is feasible but it is\nunlikely to be the only mechanism at work.

Inclusion of these processes will be\nnecessary to gain a more thorough understanding of the phenomenon under study.\nAnother limitation of our multiscale model concerns its numerical implementation. In\nparticular, the diffusion of chemicals and structural adaptation are supposed to occur on a\nmuch shorter timescale than cell division and all the processes involved in our multiscale\nmodel are assumed to be slaved to the intracellular dynamics. Whilst this assumption is\nsupported by experimental data, in order to produce accurate predictions for quantities such\nas the duration of the normalisation window and the waiting time between the end of the\nantiangiogenic therapy and the beginning of the normalisation window, both of major\nimportance for clinical applications, we most likely need to account for the timescales of\nVEGF clearance, vascular adaptation, angiogenesis and vessel pruning. This not only\nrequires a thorough re-implementation of the model, but is also related to fundamental\nquestions regarding numerical implementation of multiscale models such as how to achieve a\ntime stepping scheme that is both efficient numerically and that produces realistic results.\nThese model drawbacks will be the subject of future research.\nAcknowledgements\nTA would like to thank the EPSRC for financial support under grant GR\/509067.\nReferences\n[1] Alarco\u00b4n, T., Byrne, H.M. and Maini, P.K., 2003, A cellular automaton model for tumour growth in a\nheterogeneous environment, Journal of Theoretical Biology, 225, 257\u2013274.\n[2] Alarco\u00b4n, T., Byrne, H.M. and Maini, P.K., 2004, A mathematical model of the effects of hypoxia on the cell-\ncycle of normal and cancer cells, Journal of Theoretical Biology, 229, 395\u2013411.\n[3] Alarco\u00b4n, T., Byrne, H.M. and Maini, P.K., 2005, A multiple scale model of tumour growth, Multiscale\nModeling and Simulation, 3, 440\u2013475.\n[4] Bartha, K. and Rieger, H., 2006, Vascular network remodelling via vessel co-option, regression and growth in\ntumours, Preprint.

We calculate their respective distributions within the tissue by solving\nappropriate reaction\u2013diffusion equations and imposing zero-flux boundary conditions. We\njustify adopting the usual quasi-steady approximation in these equations on the grounds that\nthe timescales for oxygen and VEGF diffusion are much shorter than the tumour doubling\ntime which is the timescale of interest (minutes and weeks or months, respectively).\nWe denote by P the oxygen concentration and treat the cells as sinks and the vessels as\nsources of oxygen so that the relevant diffusion equation can be written\n0 \u00bc DP72P\u00fe hP\u00f0Pvess 2 P\u00de2 lcellP: \u00f0A1\u00de\nT. Alarco\u00b4n et al.114\nIn equation (A1), DP denotes the assumed constant oxygen diffusion coefficient, hP is the\nrate at which oxygen is transported across the vessel wall (hP is only non-zero where vessels\nare located), Pvess \u00bc Pvess\u00f0H\u00de is the oxygen concentration associated with a haematocrit H\n(this is determined from the vascular problem). Finally, lcell denotes the assumed constant\nrate at which cells consume oxygen, with different values for normal and cancerous cells.\nThe local VEGF profile is calculated in a similar manner, except that cells now act as\nsources of VEGF and vessels as sinks. If we further assume that VEGF is rapidly eliminated\nfrom the vasculature (so that its concentration there is zero) and denote by lV its natural half-\nlife, then V satisfies\n0 \u00bc DV72V 2 hVV \u00fe gcell 2 lVV : \u00f0A2\u00de\nIn equation (A2), DV denotes the assumed constant diffusion coefficient of VEGF and hV the\nrate at which VEGF binds the EC surface at the vessel walls. Finally, gcell represents the rate\nat which sites occupied by cells release their intracellular stores of VEGF to the extracellular\nenvironment (this occurs only when the internal levels of VEGF exceed a threshold value).\nAs with lcell in equation (A1), gcell differs between normal and cancerous cells.\nWe note that equations (A1) and (A2) for P and V above differ from those used in Ref. [3].\nThere the vessels were treated as boundaries and exchange with the vasculature was\nincorporated as an internal boundary condition rather than a distributed source term. With a\nhexagonal network of vessels, this meant that oxygen and VEGF were confined to hexagonal\nregions of the tissue.\nA.2 The cellular level\nThe dynamics of the cell colony is modelled using a two-dimensional cellular automaton, with\nN \u00a3 N automaton elements or cells [20]. Each element is characterised by a state vector,\nwhose components correspond to features of interest. These include: (i) occupation status\n(whether an element is occupied by a normal cell, a cancer cell, an empty space or a vessel),\n(ii) cell status (whether the cell is in a proliferative or quiescent state), (iii) the local oxygen\nconcentration, and (iv) the intracellular levels of VEGF, p53 and cell-cycle proteins (see\nsection 2.4). The state vector evolves according to prescribed local rules that update a given\nelement on the basis of its own state and those of its neighbours at the previous time step [1].\nThese rules were inspired by generic features of tumour growth, such as the ability of cancer\ncells to elude the control mechanisms which maintain stasis in normal tissues. They can also\nmanipulate their local environment, providing themselves with better conditions for growth\nand, eventually, for invasion of the host organism [8]. Additionally, we endow the cancer cells\nwith the ability to survive exposure to hypoxia for longer than their normal counterparts.\nFor each time step, elements of the cellular automaton are selected randomly and updated\nin turn. If a particular element is occupied by a cell, we update its internal dynamics (cell\ncycle proteins, VEGF and p53 levels). If a cell is ready to divide, the daughter cell is placed in\nthe adjacent cell with the largest oxygen concentration conditions. If there is no empty site,\nthe cell fails to divide and dies. The mechanism for cell death or apoptosis differs between\nnormal and cancer cells. In normal cells, if the intracellular level of p53 exceeds a threshold\nvalue (which depends on the cellular composition of its nearest neighbours), then the cell\ndies. By contrast, under low oxygen, cancer cells become quiescent, suspending most cell\nfunctions, including proliferation. On entering this state, a clock is started. It is incremented\nby unit steps for each time step that the cell remains quiescent. If the clock reaches a\nMultiscale modelling of tumour growth and therapy 115\nthreshold value then the cell dies. However, if the oxygen level increases above the threshold\nfor cancer cell quiescence then the cell recommences cycling and its clock is reset to zero.\nA.3 The subcellular level\nWe formulate systems of ODEs to describe the evolution of the chemicals that control the\nsubcellular processes of interest. These include progress through the cell cycle, VEGF and\np53 expression.\nThe cell cycle is regulated by complex interactions between a large number of proteins, the\nkey components being the families of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and the cyclins. The\nactivity of cyc-CDK complexes is low during G1 and becomes high after transition. In\naddition, activities of the anaphase protein complex (APC) and the protein Cdh1 are such that\ntheir levels are high in G1 but become low after the G1\/S transition. For simplicity, we base\nour work on the model of Tyson and Novak [31], which captures the essential features of the\ncell cycle and can be written in the following form:\ndx\ndt\n\u00bc \u00f0k\n0\n3 \u00fe k003A\u00de\u00f012 x\u00de\nJ3 \u00fe 12 x 2\nk4myx\nJ4 \u00fe x ; \u00f0A3\u00de\ndy\ndt\n\u00bc k1 2 \u00f0k02 \u00fe k002x\u00dey; \u00f0A4\u00de\ndm\ndt\n\u00bc mm 12 m\nm*\n\u0001 \u0002\n; \u00f0A5\u00de\nwhere x ; \u00bdCdh1\u0001 is the concentration of active Cdh1\/APC complexes, y ; \u00bdCyc\u0001 is the\nconcentration of cyclin-CDK complexes and m is the mass of the cell. The parameters ki\n\u00f0i \u00bc 1; 2; 3; 4\u00de and Ji \u00f0i \u00bc 3; 4\u00de are positive constants and A represents a generic activator. In\nequation (A5), m is the cell growth rate and m* is the mass of an adult cell.\nEquations (A3)\u2013(A5) can exhibit mono- and bi-stability, with the cell mass m as a\nbifurcation parameter. For low values of m there is a single stable steady state with a high\nvalue of x and a low value of y\u2014this corresponds to G1. As m increases, the system becomes\nbistable and a new stable steady state characterised by a high value of y and a low value of x\nemerges. For a critical value of m the latter becomes the only stable steady state and the\nsystem switches to this state, corresponding to the S phase. After the cell divides, m\ndecreases, and the system is re-set to the \u201cG1 phase steady state\u201d.\nGuided by experimental results presented in Ref. [7] and the hypothesis that under hypoxia\nexpression of the regulatory protein p27 increases [10], we generalise equations (A3)\u2013(A5)\nand study the (non-dimensionalised) model (see [2] for full details):\ndx\ndt\n\u00bc \u00f01 \u00fe b3u\u00de\u00f012 x\u00de\nJ3 \u00fe 12 x 2\nb4mxy\nJ4 \u00fe x ; \u00f0A6\u00de\ndy\ndt\n\u00bc a4 2 \u00f0a1 \u00fe a2x\u00fe a3z\u00dey; \u00f0A7\u00de\nT.

In equations (A6)\u2013(A10), we\nassume that normal and cancer cells differ only in the rates at which they produce p27. For\nnormal cells, p27 expression is regulated by cell size and we fix x\u00f0m\u00de \u00bc cn1\u00f012 \u00f0m=m*\u00de\u00de.\nFor cancerous cells, this size-regulation is assumed lost and x\u00f0m\u00de \u00bc ct1. To account for the\nlower levels of p27 observed in cancer cells compared to normal cells [22] we further\nassume that the maximum rate of p27 synthesis in normal cells exceeds that in cancer cells\n(i.e. cn1 . c\nt\n1).\nEquation (A6) renders explicit how our cell cycle model is coupled to the tissue level by\nthe oxygen concentration. As we now explain, the other intracellular processes of interest\n(i.e. VEGF production and apoptosis) are also influenced by P. In normal and cancer cells\nhypoxia stimulates the expression of VEGF and the protein p53. In normal cells p53\nstimulates apoptosis and may inhibit VEGF production [27]. In cancer cells mutations in\np53 are common and the protein may upregulate VEGF production and\/or prevent\napoptosis.\nWe denote by p and q, respectively, the concentrations of p53 and VEGF within a given\ncell and assume that their evolution is modulated by P in the following manner:\ndp\ndt\n\u00bc k7 2 k\n0\n7P\nC \u00fe P p; \u00f0A11\u00de\ndq\ndt\n\u00bc j\u00f0p; q\u00de2 k\n0\n8P\nD\u00fe P q; \u00f0A12\u00de\nwhere\nj\u00f0p; q\u00de \u00bc\nk8 2 k\nn\n8\npq\nJns\u00feq for normal cells\nk8 \u00fe kt8 pqJts\u00feq for cancer cells\n8<\n:\nand all parameters are positive. Thus VEGF expression increases under hypoxia, and p53\nincreases VEGF production in cancer cells and decreases it in normal cells. The intracellular\nlevels of p and q are assigned to the automaton state vector. For details on the experimental\nevidence supporting the forms of equations (A11) and (A12) the reader is referred to our\nprevious work [3].\nMultiscale modelling of tumour growth and therapy 117\nTable A1.

Alarco\u00b4n et al.118\nA.4 Chemotherapy\nWe now investigate how the dynamics of the normal and cancer cells change when a\nchemotherapeutic drug is introduced [5]. The calculation of drug concentration uvess within\nthe vascular network is strongly related to the computation of the haematocrit, H (see Section\n2.1). In particular, we assume that the drug is soluble in plasma and, therefore, dissolved\nwithin the liquid fraction of blood, i.e. 12 H. In particular, we will assume that the\nconcentration of drug within each vessel is given by uadm\u00f012 H\u00de where uadm is the\nadministered dose. As with the oxygen, we view the vessels as distributed sources of drug\nand assume that, once the drug leaves the vessels, it diffuses through the tissue and is taken\nup by the normal and healthy cells.\nGuided by equation (A1) and denoting by u the drug concentration in the tissue, at each\ntime step we solve the following diffusion equation, with no-flux boundary conditions, to\ndetermine u:\n0 \u00bc Du72u\u00fe hu\u00f0uvess 2 u\u00de2 ldrugu: \u00f0A13\u00de\nIn equation (A13), Du denotes the assumed constant diffusion coefficient of the drug, hu the\nrate at which it is transported across the vessel wall and ldrug the assumed constant rate at\nwhich cells absorb the drug (we assume that ldrug is the same for normal and cancerous cells).\nHaving determined uvess and u, it remains to specify the drug\u2019s mode of action. Ultimately,\nwe hope to tailor our model to specific drugs according to the stage(s) of the cell cycle at\nwhich they act. However, for simplicity, here we assume that the drug works in the following\nmanner. If the local drug concentration exceeds a threshold value then the cell is killed.\nA.5 Numerical algorithm\nWhen performing simulations the following algorithm is used at each time step:\ni) update the vascular network using the structural adaptation rules;\nii) calculate the blood flow and haematocrit at all points within the vascular network;\niii) update the oxygen, VEGF and drug profiles by solving the relevant boundary value\nproblems; and\niv) update the elements of the cellular automaton, and the intracellular variables associated\nwith each non-empty element according to whether it is occupied by a normal or\ncancerous cell.\nB Parameter values\nIn this Appendix, we provide the values of the parameters needed to solve the PDEs for the\ndrugs (cytotoxic and anti-VEGFR drugs) as well as the values of the parameters\ncorresponding to the up- and down-stream stimuli of the vascular adaptation (table A1).\nOther parameter values can be found in Ref. [3] and are reproduced here for completeness\n(tables A2 and A3).\nMultiscale modelling of tumour growth and therapy 119\n"}
