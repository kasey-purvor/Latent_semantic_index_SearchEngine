It is diecult  to \nsatisfy both conditions simultaneously. \nDiscussion: There is a strong trend \ntowards fabrication of smaller photonic \ndevices to improve device performance \nand cost. However, the polarisation \ndependence and single mode conditions \nhave not been discussed in sufficient \ndetail for smaller waveguide \ndimensions. We have used the semi- \nvectorial beam propagation method \n(BPM) to analyse the waveguide structure in figure 1 for single mode propagation and zero birefringence both in TE \nand TM-like modes. The result for the single mode condition was compared with a finite-difference vector solver \nand the scalar approximation method; the simulation data are currently being compared with the more accurate finite \ndifference time domain (FDTD) method. Soref et al. [I]  first derived an expression for the single-mode condition \n(SMC) in relatively large rib waveguides in which parameter r (see figure 1) of 0.5 r < 1.0 was imposed on the \nUnalysis.

The degree of influence of etch depth on waveguide \nperformance also becomes apparent when small waveguides are designed for zero birefringence [4, 51. It is usually \ndesirable to be able to satisfy both the single mode and the zero birefringence conditions to improve device \nperformance in small SO1 rib waveguides. \nThe single mode simulation was setup using the waveguide structnre shown in Fig. 1, which is a rib waveguide of \nsilicon (n,=3.477) on silica (n,=1.444) and has an upper cladding that is air (&=I). We assumed there is no coupling \nbetween the TE-like and TM-like fields and most of the field energy is in one polarisation (the major component). \nOur initial investigation was for a waveguide height of 1.50pm and operating wavelength of h=1550nm. The \nwaveguide height (H). etch depth (D), and slab height (h)  of the waveguide were kept constant while increasing the \nwaveguide width in increments of 0.01pm to find the single-modeimultimode boundary. The iteration of the \nsimulation is repeated with different values of the slab height to waveguide height ratio, parameter r .  The process is \nto gradually increase the waveguide width until a second mode propagates, thereby determining the maximum \nwaveguide width to sustain single mode operation. In Figure 2, the results of mode cut-off using the semi-vectorial \nBPM approach were compared with the scalar approximation (Powell) and results from Soref and Pogossian whose \nresults are extrapolated to include the range r < 0.5. One can observe the results for the scalar approximation and \nTE-like result are very similar for large range of values of parameter r. This scalar approximation result is also in \nsurprisingly close agreement with [ I ]  and [3] for values of parameter r less than approximately 0.40, where small rib \nwaveguides with low width to height ratio are very polarisation dependent, hence the need for this analysis. \nHowever, the simulation suggested that the results of Pogossian et al. [ 2 ]  are less useful. It will be shown later that \nthe SMC for both polarisations converges for values of the parameter r greater than approximately 0.55, in good \nagreement with the original work of Soref et al. [I]. This confirms that the work of Soref et al. [ 11, or even the scalar \napproximation can be used as a basis of design of single mode waveguides for shallow etch rib waveguide (r > 0.5) \nwith large cross section. However, the differences between the single mode conditions for different polarisations at \nsmaller values of parameter r, particularly in small waveguides, are significant. This is because the optical \nconfinement for such small waveguides is dominated by the boundary conditions, which are well known to be \ndifferent for TE-like and TM-like modes. If we tum our attention to the design of birefringence free waveguides, we \ncan then provide guidelines for achieving both single mode behaviour and polarisation independence in the \nwaveguide. \nThe degree of influence of waveguide width and etch depth on waveguide birefringence for a given rib height is \ndemonstrated further bere. We used a rib waveguide height of 1.50pm for consistency with our analysis in figure 1. \nWe then evaluated the effective indices of the fundamental TE-like and TM-like modes. If we assume an operating \nwavelength of 1550 nm, we can produce a graph of the variation of the TE\/TM fundamental mode effective index \ndifference for various etch depths (0) and waveguide widths (W). Figure 3 shows various curves, each for a \ndifferent etch depth. The \ncurves cross the zero \nbirefringence axis when \neffective indices of both \npolarisation modes is the same, \nwhich indicates it is possible to \nproduce birefringence free \nwaveguides for some of the \ngeometries and dimensions \nwhen a deeper etch depth is \nemployed. All the data points \nwhich cross the zero \nbirefringence axis are used in \nfigure 4 in terms of W\/H ratio \nand parameter r, to plot a locus \nof the birefringence free \ncondition for vaIying \nwaveguide dimensions. This is \nused to show the relationship \nbetween single mode and \nbirefringence free operation and \n-0.001 1 \\ \n-Etch depth 0.90pm _ _ _ _  Etch depth 0 . 8 9 ~ 1 ~  \n......

Similar data is included for a second waveguide height \nof 1.35pm. Also included in figure 4 are trend lines for the single mode condition for TE-like and TM-like modes. \nIt is clear from figures 4a and 4b that it is difficult to achieve single mode operation at both polarisations whilst \nmaintaining polarisation independence. It should be noted that the trend lines are approximate because they are the \nresults of curve fitting, therefore for a specific design, data points should be used instead of the trend lines. In order \nto satisfy both the requirements of single mode operation and polarisation independence, we must choose a point on \nthe birefringence free locus that is below the single mode boundary for both TE-like and TM-like modes. It is \ninteresting to note that the intersection between the birefringence free locus and the TE-like graphs determines the \nlimit of the waveguide width to guide only the fundamental TE mode. For instance, the maximum values of rib \nwidth are 0.98pm and 1.07pm for waveguide heights of 1 . 3 5 ~  and 1.50pm respectively, to satisfy the TE-like \nsingle mode condition and the birefringence free condition, but the birefringence free and TM-like single mode trend \nlines do not cross (although the scatter of the data about the trend line means that in some cases both conditions can \nbe met). It should be noted that single mode condition is similar but not the same for different waveguide heights as \nillustrated in figures 4a and 4b. Both single mode behaviour for TE-like and TM-like converged approximately at \nparameter r = 0.55, suggesting that scalar approximation can be used as a basis of designs greater than r = 0.55 but \ntrend lines are preferably for smaller values of parameter r. \nWaveguide height, H = 1.50um \n\/\u2019 3.1 _,.\u2018 \nWaveguide height, H = 1.35pm \n1.1 \nLocus of NE= N, \n1.0- \n0.30 0.33 0.36 0.39 0 4 2  0.45 0.46 0.51 0.54 0.57 0.60 \n0 . 3 K I  . \u2019 ,  , , , , , , , , , , . , , , . \n0.20 0.33 0.36 039 0.42 0.45 0.48 0.51 0.54 0.51 0.60 \n\u2019 Parameter, Parameter r \n(a) (b) \nFigure 4 Trend lines for single mode cut-offdimensions and zero birefringence as afunction of waveguide dimensions, for \nan operating u,avelengtli of J.=1550nm, andfor uaveguide heights of (a) 1 . 3 5 ~  and (bi 1 . 5 O p n  \nConclusiotr : \nWe have studied the design parameters of rib waveguide structure to satisfy both single mode and polarisation \nindependence. The requirement of birefringence free waveguides can be fulfilled by using a deep etch depth when \nusing small waveguides, but it is difficult to simultaneously satisfy the single mode conditions. Not surprisingly the \nscalar approximation is accurate enough to design single mode waveguide with large cross section for r > 0.5, in \nagreement with results of Soref et al. [ I ]  and Powell [3]. Hence individual design simulation should be used as a \nbasis to design waveguides with smaller parameter of r (deep etch) to achieve single mode and birefringence free \noperation simultaneously, or for less stringent requirements our trend lines are a useful guideline. \nReferences: \n[ I ]  R.
