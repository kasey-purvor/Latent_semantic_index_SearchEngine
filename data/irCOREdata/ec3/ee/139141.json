With the continued\ndrive for improved performance, the limitations of\nconventional bearing systems have become more evi-\ndent [1]. For example, the medium term accuracy\ncapability of oil hydrostatic bearings is limited by the\nthermal effects caused by the increased heat gener-\nated by viscous shear. Thermal distortion and drift are\nconsidered major sources of error in higher precision\nmanufacture [2, 3]. To minimize these effects, an alter-\nnative to conventional hydrostatic oil journal bearings\nhas been developed [4]. In this technology, the journal\nbearing is a hollow cylinder made of a porous ceramic\nmaterial. The externally pressurized lubricant is sup-\nplied to the bearing gap through the ceramic bearing\u2019s\nporous wall, as opposed to the 4\u20136 restrictor\/pocket\narrangement typically found in conventional hydro-\nstatic bearings. The extremely large number of inte-\ngrated restrictors, results in an improved fluid film\n\u2217Corresponding author: Department of Materials, Cranfield Uni-\nversity, Building 70, Cranfield, Bedfordshire MK43 0AL, UK.\nemail: i.s.durazocardenas@cranfield.ac.uk\npressure distribution. In addition, the absence of bear-\ning pockets enhances the hydrodynamic component,\nimproving the overall load capacity and stiffness of the\nbearing [5], while permitting the spindle assembly to\nreach higher speeds before the onset of turbulence.\nOther advantages of ceramics as bearing material\nare low coefficient of expansion, long-term dimen-\nsional stability and stiffness over a wide range of\ntemperatures, as well as their superior corrosion resis-\ntance. In addition, ceramics can be machined without\npore smearing.\nDespite all the benefits, porous ceramic hydrostatic\njournal bearings have yet to be embraced by preci-\nsion engineers and machine tool designers. So far, the\nmain obstacle has been the intricacy of the bearing\u2019s\nmanufacturing method, hot isostatic pressing (HIP).\nThis method consists of the vibration packing of alu-\nmina powders followed by partial sintering in a high\npressure argon environment [4]. Significant machin-\ning is required to achieve the ceramic bearing\u2019s final\ndimensions and HIP is a relatively expensive tech-\nnique. So far, only journal bearings of 50 mm inside\ndiameter and 50 mm long have been achieved, which\nlimits their application. A more recent research effort\n[6] has addressed these issues by investigating alter-\nnative processing routes and the development of a\nprocessing method that is based on a starch consolida-\ntion (SC) technique [7]. Cost effective journal bearings\nof various sizes and porosity levels, suitable for a wide\nJET570 \u00a9 IMechE 2010 Proc. IMechE Vol. 224 Part J: J.

The results\nare presented in terms of static and rotational stiff-\nness, lubricant flowrate, pumping power and lubricant\ntemperature rise. These results have been compared\nhead to head with the results obtained from a conven-\ntional 5-recess hydrostatic journal bearing of the same\nsize and comparable design, under the same testing\nconditions.\n2 EXPERIMENTAL\n2.1 Porous ceramic bearingmanufacture\nThe ceramic bearing processing route was the SC\ntechnique [7]. The SC technique is a simple yet effec-\ntive method for producing porous ceramics. In simple\nterms, it involves the mixing of alumina powders,\nwater, starch granules, and a dispersant to create a\nceramic slip. The slip is cast into a mould and heated\nup to 70 \u25e6C. At this temperature, the starch granules\nswell by water uptake and as a consequence, the slip\nconsolidates into a solid body. The starch granules are\nburnt out in a subsequent de-binding operation, leav-\ning corresponding voids in the ceramic matrix. Further\ndensification at 1550 \u25e6C follows. The final porosity of\nthe ceramic bearing is a result of the amount of starch\nin the slip and the sintering rate of the alumina pow-\nder used. Grinding to final dimensions completes the\nbearing manufacture. Figure 2 illustrates the typical\nmicrostructure of a journal bearing produced by the\nSC technique.\nThe most important properties and design parame-\nters of the SC porous ceramic bearing tested are shown\nin Table 1.\n2.2 Permeability measurement\nThe permeability of the porous ceramic bearing was\nmeasured using a specially designed test rig compliant\nwith standard BS 5600 [8].\nDarcy\u2019s law describes flow of fluids through porous\nmaterials at relatively low velocity, where only viscous\nfactors are prevalent. This equation is used to derive\nthe viscous permeability coefficient (\u03c8v) and can be\nwritten as follows\n\u0003p\nt\n= Q\u03b7\nA\u03c8v\n(1)\nAt higher flowrates, inertial effects become significant\nand Forchheimer\u2019s equation [8] is used for the deter-\nmination of the viscous (\u03c8v) and inertial permeability\n(\u03c8i) coefficients\n\u0003p\nt\n= Q\u03b7\nA\u03c8v\n+ Q\n2\u03c1\nA2\u03c8i\n(2)\nEquations (1) and (2) describe the relationship bet-\nween pressure drop (\u0003p) and volume flowrate (Q).\nDuring measurement, the journal bearing was\nclamped axially between two flat sealing surfaces.\nPressurized fluid applied from the outside of the bear-\ning permeated inwards through the bearing wall. Ten\npressure drop and volume flow readings were taken.\nThe pressure differential across the bearing ranged\nfrom 0.1 to 1.0 MPa. The test fluid was oil (DIE 180,\nBP). Viscosity and density values of 1.9 mm2\/s and\n752 kg\/m3 at 20 and 15 \u25e6C, respectively, were speci-\nfied by the lubricant manufacturer. This information\nwas complemented with a more thorough study con-\nducted in accordance with BS 188 [9] and 4699 [10].\nThe oil temperature was monitored throughout the\nmeasurement to compensate for variations in the\ndensity and viscosity values.\nPermeability measurement results were predomi-\nnantly of viscous nature, in agreement with previous\nwork [4]. Table 2 illustrates measured Q values against\n\u0003p. The calculated viscous permeability of the SC\nbearing was 2.6 \u00d7 10\u221214 m2. This was close to the\noptimum value of 1 \u00d7 10\u221214 m2 for a porous ceramic\njournal bearing of the same dimensions, as mod-\nelled in a previous study [4]. Further details of the\npermeability measurement procedure can be found\nelsewhere [6, 8].\n2.3 Hydrostatic bearing design andmanufacture\nThe hydrostatic bearing used in this study was of\nthe same size and comparable design to the porous\nceramic journal. Well-established guidelines [11] were\nfollowed for the bearing design and manufacture. Cast\niron was used for the construction of the bearing main\nbody and components. A 5-recess\/capillary restrictor\narrangement was used. The bearing was designed to\nProc. IMechE Vol. 224 Part J: J.

This test rig is a\nfully instrumented system that includes sensors for\nmeasuring the lubricant temperature and pressure at\nbearing inlet points, within the fluid film, and at the\nbearing outlet. The test rig houses journal bearings of\n50 mm inside diameter, 62 mm outside diameter, and\n50 mm long.\nThe input variables were the supply pressure, bear-\ning speed, and bearing load. A set of four capacitive\ngauges are used in conjunction with a data acqui-\nsition subroutine for the deflection measurement.\nThe capacitive gauges have a specified resolution of\n8 nm statically and 40 nm dynamically. Further cali-\nbration procedures showed the system was capable\nof measuring deflection with an overall accuracy of\n20 nm statically and 200 nm under rotating condi-\ntions [6, 12].\nOther ancillary equipments that the testing rig\nincorporates include a hydrostatic oil power pack,\na refrigerated cooling unit, a hydrostatic lubricant\npower pack with a filter system for total debris and bac-\nterial removal, as well as a comprehensive automated\ndata acquisition system.\nPrior to testing, a warm up period of 1 h run-\nning at the selected test speed (r\/min) was observed.\nThis allowed the conventional oil hydrostatic bear-\nings in the drive spindle to reach a stable operating\ntemperature.\nLow viscosity oil (DIE 180, BP) was used as lubri-\ncant during the performance testing. This represents\na novelty in relation to the performance measurement\nof porous-ceramic bearings, as only water and air have\nbeen used previously [4, 13, 14]. The oil temperature\nwas monitored to allow corrections of the density and\nviscosity values where appropriate.\nThe bearing radial gap for the two types of bear-\ning, porous ceramic and conventional hydrostatic, was\n26.5\u03bcm.\nStiffness and flow measurement trials were con-\nducted thrice to verify repeatability. Temperature rise\nmeasurements were conducted twice. The maximum\nerror observed was of the order of 5 per cent. Fur-\nther details of the design and building of this test rig,\nincluding operational and calibration procedures have\nbeen described extensively before [4, 12].\n2.5 Measurement of stiffness\nFor the measurement of stiffness, the test bearings\nwere positioned in the centre of their working section.\nA dead weight load was applied using a cable. Stiff-\nness was calculated from the resulting bearing housing\ndeflection with respect to the shaft. Measurements\nwere conducted at a fixed supply pressure of 1.0 MPa.\nThe radial load was gradually incremented from 0 to\n100 N in 10 N steps. The results of the static stiffness\nwere plotted against the bearings eccentricity ratio\n(\u03b50). The eccentricity ratio is a porous hydrostatic\njournal bearing design parameter [15], defined by\n\u03b50 = eC (3)\nRotational stiffness was calculated by measuring\ndeflection under the applied load at different spindle\nFig. 4 Porous-ceramic hydrostatic journal bearings performance test rig [12]\nProc.

Rotational stiffness results\nare presented in relation to the spindle speed.\n2.6 Measurement of flowrate, pumping power, and\ntemperature rise\nFlowrate was measured using a weigh tank, a cal-\nibrated four-digit resolution digital balance, and a\nstopwatch.The lubricant inlet and outlet temperatures\nwere also monitored to permit density and viscos-\nity corrections. Flowrate tests were conducted under\nstatic conditions, with fixed supply pressures of 0.25,\n0.50, 0.75, and 1.0 MPa under no load conditions.\nPumping power was calculated as the product of the\nlubricant flowrate and the supply pressure.\nWp = PsQ (4)\nFriction power is dissipated in the bearing fluid film as\nthermal energy. This causes a corresponding increase\nin the lubricant temperature. During the temperature\nrise measurement, the supply pressure was fixed at\n1.0 MPa. Previous to the measurement, the spindle\nwas run for 1 h under no load conditions to allow the\nlubricant\u2019s temperature to reach a stable condition.\nThe difference in temperature between bearing\u2019s inlet\nand outlet was then recorded and plotted against the\nobserved spindle speed.\n3 RESULTS ANDDISCUSSION\n3.1 Static stiffness\nFigure 5 shows the static stiffness results against the\neccentricity ratio for the two bearing types. As seen,\nthe conventional bearing stiffness averaged 22 N\/\u03bcm,\nwhile operating at a supply pressure of 1 MPa. In con-\ntrast, the stiffness of the SC bearing was 43 N\/\u03bcm at the\nsame supply pressure. The higher stiffness observed\nis attributable to the improved pressure distribution\nresulting from the multitude of minute restrictors in\nthe porous wall.\nFig. 5 Bearing technology comparison: static stiffness\nversus eccentricity ratio\nThe eccentricity ratio values observed for the\nporous ceramic bearing are quite low in compari-\nson to the hydrostatic bearing, indicating a higher\noverall bearing stiffness. The observed trend-line is\ntypical of the measurements performed on porous\nceramic hydrostatic journal bearings manufactured\nby the SC technique [6]; and, in general, they are\nalso comparable with those observed in previous\nresearch [12].\n3.2 Rotational stiffness results\nFigure 6 illustrates the results of the measured rota-\ntional stiffness for the porous-ceramic bearing and\nthe conventional 5-recess hydrostatic bearing. Once\nagain, it was observed that the porous-ceramic bear-\ning achieves higher stiffness than the conventional\nhydrostatic bearing. The stiffness curve of the porous-\nceramic bearing displayed a noteworthy growth with\nthe increasing spindle speed. This growth is directly\nassociated with the improved hydrodynamic effect\nparticular to hydrostatic porous bearings, result-\ning from the absence of bearing pockets. For the\nporous ceramic bearing tested, this effect is more\npronounced after 2000 r\/min. At 4000 r\/min, the\nhydrodynamic component of the stiffness was over\n80 N\/\u03bcm, considerably higher than the static stiff-\nness. In contrast, the hydrostatic bearing stiffness\ndisplayed a slowly growing curve, demonstrating a less\nsignificant hydrodynamic component. At 4000 r\/min,\nthe hydrodynamic component of the stiffness was\n9 N\/\u03bcm.\nThe porous bearing absence of pockets also results\nin less turbulence. This permitted the stiffness of the\nporous ceramic bearing to be assessed further. It was\nobserved that the bearing continued to achieve higher\nstiffness with increasing spindle speeds, reaching a\nmaximum of 167 N\/\u03bcm at 6000 r\/min.\nRotational stiffness results of the porous ceramic\nbearing are in good agreement with the trends\nobserved in a previous porous ceramic research [12].\nFig. 6 Bearing technology comparison: rotational stiff-\nness versus spindle speed\nJET570 \u00a9 IMechE 2010 Proc.

Engineering Tribology\n86 I S Durazo-Cardenas, J Corbett, and D J Stephenson\n3.3 Flowratemeasurement results and discussion\nFigure 7 illustrates a flowrate comparison between\nthe porous-ceramic bearing and the conventional 5-\nrecess hydrostatic bearing. The flowrate results are\npresented as a function of the supply pressure. As\nobserved, the conventional hydrostatic bearing flow-\nrate is significantly higher than the porous ceramic\nbearing. Factors significantly influencing this beha-\nviour are the bearing\u2019s radial gap and resistance\nratio [11]. Conversely, the lower flowrate of the por-\nous bearing resulting from the absence of pockets\nis mainly influenced by the bearing\u2019s permeability\n[6, 12].\nThe flowrate characteristics of oil-lubricated porous\nhydrostatic journal bearings have been studied analyt-\nically by Chattopadhyay etal. [5].The predicted porous\nbearing flow is defined by\nQ\u00af = Q\u00afc + Q\u00afp = Q\u03b7LC3DPs (5)\nwhere\nQ\u00afc = \u221216\n\u222b \u03b82\n0\nh3(1 + \u03b6z)\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2202p\u00af\u2202 z\u00af\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\nz\u00af=1\nd\u03b8 (6)\nQp = \u2212\n(\n\u03b2\n6\n)(\nH\nR\n)2\nKZ\n\u222b \u03b82\n0\n\u222b 0\n\u22121\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2202p\u00af\u2202 z\u00af\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 dy\u00af d\u03b8 (7)\nand\n\u03b6z = 3(h\u00af\u03c3z + 2\u03b1)\n\u03c3z(h\u00af + \u03b1h2\u03c3z)\n(8)\np\u00af =\n(\np\nPs\n)\n(9)\nz\u00af = 2z\nL\n(10)\nKz =\n(\nkz\nky\n)\n(11)\nFig. 7 Bearing technology comparison: flowrate versus\nsupply pressure\ny\u00af = y\nH\n(12)\nh\u00af = h\nC\n(13)\n\u03c3z = C(kz)\u22121\/2 (14)\nChattopadhyay [5] solved Q\u00af by numerical integration\nusing Simpson\u2019s 1\/3rd rule. Flow is presented in terms\nof dimensionless values of a bearing feed parameter\n\u03b2, the eccentricity ratio \u03b50 (equation (3)) and the L\/D\nratio. The bearing feed parameter is defined by\n\u03b2 = 12kyR\n2\nC3H\n(15)\nFor the porous ceramic bearing \u03b2 = 1.74.\nThe experimental data from the porous ceramic\nbearing have been compared with the predicted flow\n(equation (5)) using Chattopadhyay\u2019s analysis [5] and\na close correlation has been observed for the differ-\nent values of Ps used. Flowrate results, measured, and\npredicted, are presented in Table 4.\nIt was generally observed that the measured flowrate\nwas marginally larger than predicted. This effect was\nnoted previously [12], and has been attributed to\nexperimental error arising mainly from a very small\namount of lubricant escaping axially through the\nporous bearing sealing.\n3.4 Pumping power\nPower consumption is an important parameter when\nassessing the economic performance of a bearing\nsystem. From the flowrates observed, it follows that\nthe pumping power consumed by the conventional\nhydrostatic is higher. Figure 8 illustrates the calculated\npumping power for each bearing in relation to the sup-\nply pressure. As observed, the conventional 5-recess\nhydrostatic bearing consumes more power. The differ-\nence in power consumed between the two bearings at\na maximum supply pressure of 1.0 MPa was of 13W.\n3.5 Temperature rise\nFigure 9 illustrates the temperature increase with spin-\ndle speed for the porous ceramic bearing and the\nTable 4 Porous ceramic bearing flow-\nrate: measured versus predic-\nted (\u03b2 = 1.74)\nQ (m3\/s)\nPs (MPa) Measured Predicted [5]\n0.25 5.65 \u00d7 10\u221206 5.37 \u00d7 10\u221206\n0.5 1.14 \u00d7 10\u221205 1.07 \u00d7 10\u221205\n0.75 1.75 \u00d7 10\u221205 1.61 \u00d7 10\u221205\n1 2.30 \u00d7 10\u221205 2.15 \u00d7 10\u221205\n1.5 3.46 \u00d7 10\u221205 3.23 \u00d7 10\u221205\nProc.

The higher temper-\nature rise exhibited by the conventional hydrostatic\nbearing is evident. A maximum temperature difference\nof 1.6 \u25e6C was observed at 4000 r\/min. In contrast, the\nporous-ceramic bearing temperature rise at the same\nspindle speed was of 0.8 \u25e6C. Since the same oil was used\nas the lubricant in both bearings, the higher tempera-\nture exhibited by the conventional hydrostatic bearing\nis mainly attributable to the effect of re-circulating\nflow of the lubricant within the bearing pockets, which\ngives rise to greater frictional drag. This type of flow\nand its effect is particular to this technology and rep-\nresents a major drawback for ultra-precision applica-\ntions. In contrast, in the operation of porous-ceramic\nhydrostatic bearings, the lubricant readily escapes the\nbearing gap in a more consistent manner.\n4 SUMMARYOF EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND\nDISCUSSION\nTable 5 illustrates the results comparing the bearing\ntechnologies for each parameter examined.

The fourth column shows the improve-\nment factor in favour of the porous ceramic bearing.\nThe results observed during the present study\nillustrate significant benefits of the porous ceramic\nhydrostatic technology over the conventional one.\nThese results are consistent with a previous analyti-\ncal performance study comparing a porous ceramic\nwater bearing manufactured via HIP and an oil-\nlubricated conventional hydrostatic bearing. The stiff-\nness improvement factor in favour of the HIP porous\nceramic bearing was of the order of 153 per cent [12],\nwhich is very similar to the 158 per cent achieved by\nthe SC porous ceramic bearing, as shown in Fig. 6.\nHowever, the cost of a porous ceramic journal bearing\nmanufactured by the SC technique is 36 per cent lower\nthan that of a bearing made by the HIP process [6].\nThe lubricant flowrate of porous ceramic was signif-\nicantly lower than the 5-recess conventional bearing\n(64 per cent) as expected. This correlated well with\na previously published theoretical analysis [5]. The\nporous-bearing lubricant lower viscous-shear resulted\nin an improvement of 50 per cent on thermal per-\nformance compared with the conventional bearing.\nThis porous bearing attributes address directly some\nof the major sources of error in higher precision\nmanufacture [2, 3].\nHydrostatic journal bearings are a well-established\ntechnology. However by virtue of their performance,\nhigher stiffness coupled with lower heat generation\nand economic performance, porous ceramic hydro-\nstatic journal bearings are a viable alternative to\ntraditional hydrostatic journal bearings for the most\ndemanding high precision applications.\nIn the past, widespread implementation of porous\nceramic technology has been prevented by intricate\nmanufacturing techniques. Recent developments in\nporous ceramics processing [6, 14] suggest the man-\nufacture of repeatable and cost effective bearings can\nbe successfully achieved.\n5 CONCLUSIONS\n1. In a head to head performance comparison with a\nhydrostatic journal bearing of the same dimensions\nJET570 \u00a9 IMechE 2010 Proc. IMechE Vol. 224 Part J: J. Engineering Tribology\n88 I S Durazo-Cardenas, J Corbett, and D J Stephenson\nand comparable design, under identical testing\nconditions, a porous ceramic demonstrated:\n(a) 95 per cent higher static stiffness, resulting\nfrom a more uniform hydrostatic pressure dis-\ntribution;\n(b) 158 per cent higher rotational stiffness, result-\ning from an optimized hydrodynamic effect;\n(c) 50 per cent lower lubricant temperature, res-\nulting from a lower lubricant viscous shear;\n(d) 64 per cent lower flowrate, mainly due to the\nporous bearing having no pocketed recesses;\n(e) 64 per cent lower pumping requirement, result-\ning from a lower flowrate.\n2. Cost effective porous ceramic hydrostatic journal\nbearings produced by the SC technique exhibit\nperformance characteristics, i.e. stiffness, flowrate,\npumping power, and temperature rise that are con-\nsistent with the performance of porous ceramic\nhydrostatic journal bearings produced previously\nby HIP.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge CONACyT (Mex-\nico) for providing Dr Durazo-Cardenas studentship\nfunds and Mr M.
