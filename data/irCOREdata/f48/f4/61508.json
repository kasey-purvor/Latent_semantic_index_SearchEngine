However, this process has not been accompanied by increased \nmechanisation or fertiliser use (Swinkels et al. 1997), causing serious \ndegradation of natural resources and a decline in per capita food production \n(Sanchez et al. 1997).  As average land holdings decrease, farmers cannot \nafford to allocate separate areas to grow crops and trees.  In such cases, \nagroforestry may provide a viable alternative to sustain productivity on \nsmallholder farms while supplying a range of tree products.  This is \nparticularly important in south-western Uganda, where crop yield is <35 % of \npotential production and there is an estimated 40 % shortfall in wood supply \n(Siriri and Bekunda 2004); similar problems occur throughout the semi-arid \nand sub-humid tropics.  The present study examined novel systems in which \nthe degraded upper third of terraces on steep hillsides was planted with \ntrees, while the lower terrace was used for crop production.   \n \nIncorporation of trees on cropland may enhance productivity by increasing \nnutrient input through nitrogen fixation (Sanginga et al. 1995; Sun et al. \n2008), spatial and\/or temporal complementarity in resource capture by trees \nand crops (Ong et al. 2006, 2007), increased infiltration and storage of water \n(Wallace 1996; Sun et al. 2008), maintenance of, or increases in, soil organic \nmatter (Schroeder 1995; Sun et al. 2008), reduced nutrient losses by erosion \nand leaching (Sun et al. 2008) and improved soil physical properties and \nbiological activity (Yamoah et al. 1986).  Agroforestry technologies promoted \nin East Africa include improved fallows containing Sesbania sesban and \nrotational woodlots of Calliandra calothyrsus or Alnus acuminata (Siriri and \nRaussen 2003).  These aim to improve soil fertility and provide valuable tree \nproducts by planting trees on the upper section of bench terraces which have \nbecome degraded following repeated scouring during heavy rain and regular \ndown-slope cultivation (Agus et al. 1997).  Planting trees on the upper terrace \nis a recommended rehabilitation practice (Raussen et al. 1999; Siriri and \n 3\n81 \n82 \n83 \n84 \n85 \n86 \n87 \n88 \n89 \n90 \n91 \n92 \n93 \n94 \n95 \n96 \n97 \n98 \n99 \n100 \n101 \n102 \n103 \n104 \n105 \n106 \n107 \n108 \n109 \n110 \n111 \n112 \nRaussen 2003) which allows cropping to continue on the more fertile lower \nterrace.  Contour planting of trees has also proved successful in limiting \nrunoff and erosion and improving fertility on hillslopes under a wide range of \nclimatic conditions in China (Sun et al. 2008).    \n \nHowever, agroforestry does not always provide a solution, as negative \ninteractions may occur due to competition with adjacent crops (Ong et al. \n2006, 2007; Sun et al. 2008).  Some reports suggest there is little \ncompetition on bench terraces due to spatial or temporal separation of the \ntrees and crops (Cooper et al. 1996), although farmers have reported that \ntrees may compete with adjacent crops (Wajja-Musukwe et al. 1997; Sun et \nal. 2008).  This is important as crop production on the lower terrace is vital \nfor food security during the first 2-3 years after planting while farmers await \nthe benefits of trees grown on the upper terrace.  Effective strategies are \nneeded to minimise adverse tree-crop interactions on terraced land.   \n \nSchroth (1999) suggested two options to enhance complementarity: (i) \nselection of trees with characteristics which minimise competition; and (ii) \nmanagement to limit their competitive impact.  Characteristics which limit \ncompetition do not always coincide with the intended use of trees by farmers, \nfor example, when timber production or revenue generation from the sale of \ngreenhouse gas credits (TIST 2008) are key objectives.  When farmers\u2019 \nneeds and ecological compatibility conflict, understanding and appropriate \nmanipulation of the underlying processes are essential.  Root and\/or shoot \npruning may be used to control the competitive impact of trees (Ong et al. \n2002, 2006, 2007; Bayala et al. 2008).  In semi-arid Kenya, Jackson et al. \n(2000) showed that severe shoot pruning reduced water use by trees, \nimproving recharge of the crop rooting zone, while Jones et al. (1998) found \nthat shoot pruning of Prosopis juliflora in semi-arid Nigeria reduced below-\nground competition with sorghum.  Chandrashekara (2007) recommended \nshoot pruning regimes and frequencies for 10 important tree species in \nhumid Kerala, India to limit competition with understorey crops.  The present \n 4\n113 \n114 \n115 \n116 \n117 \n118 \nstudy examined the role of root and\/or shoot pruning as management tools \nto reduce the competitiveness of trees on terraces in sub-humid Uganda.  \nThe objectives were to determine (i) the impact and spatial extent of \ncompetition between trees on the upper terrace and adjacent crops, and (ii) \nthe effectiveness of root and\/or shoot pruning in controlling deleterious \neffects on crop yield.  \n 5\n 6\n119 \n120 \n121 \n122 \n123 \n124 \n125 \n126 \n127 \n128 \n129 \n130 \n131 \n132 \n133 \n134 \n135 \n136 \n137 \n138 \n139 \n140 \n141 \n142 \n143 \n144 \n145 \n146 \n147 \n148 \n149 \n150 \nMaterials and methods \n \nKabale District, SW Uganda, experiences bimodal rainfall of c. 1000 mm yr-1, \nwhich is generally greater and more evenly distributed during the long \n(September-February) than the short rains (April-June).  Most land is steeply \nterraced to control runoff and erosion; these are 15-20 m wide with a rise of \nc. 1.5 m between terraces.  Agriculture involves small-scale arable farming, \nwith sorghum, maize, beans, peas and sweet and Irish potatoes as the main \ncrops.  This study took place at Kigezi High School (1o 15\u2019 S, 29o 55\u2019 E, \naltitude 1850 m), where the mean slope of terraces is c. 8 %.  The soils are \nhaplic ferralitic sandy clay loams developed from phyllite parent material.  \nTopsoil analysis (0-15 cm) showed that mean pH was 6.5 and clay content \ndecreased from 37.4 to 27.1 % between the upper and lower terrace \n(p<0.05; Siriri and Raussen, 2003).  Organic matter was very low but \nincreased from 1.11 to 1.31 g kg-1 between upper and lower terrace, \nsuggesting that N supplies were limiting, though this was not specifically \ndetermined.  Bicarbonate EDTA extractable phosphorus and exchangeable \npotassium concentrations were 27-36 mg kg-1 and 0.48-0.54 molc kg-1 \nrespectively; P values decreased between the upper and lower terrace. \n \nA split-plot design with three replicates was used (Fig. 1).  Trees were \nplanted in three rows at a density equivalent to 10000 trees ha-1 on the \nupper third of the terrace (6 m wide).  Treatments comprised four tree-based \nsystems (sole stands of Alnus acuminata Kunth (alnus), Calliandra \ncalothyrsus Meissner (calliandra), Sesbania sesban (L.) Merr. var. sesban \n(sesbania) and a mixture of all three species) plus sole crop control plots.  \nThese tree species were chosen due to their ability to produce 24-27 t ha-1 of \nfuelwood and c. 30 t ha-1 of above-ground biomass under the prevailing \nconditions and their N-fixing capability (Siriri and Raussen 2003).  The \nexperimental design was unbalanced because the main plots containing sole \ncrop controls could only accommodate three of the four pruning sub-\ntreatments (Fig. 1), but was as nearly balanced as possible given the \n151 \n152 \n153 \n154 \n155 \n156 \n157 \n158 \n159 \n160 \n161 \n162 \n163 \n164 \n165 \n166 \n167 \n168 \n169 \n170 \n171 \n172 \n173 \n174 \n175 \n176 \n177 \n178 \n179 \n180 \n181 \n182 \nprevailing site constraints.  Main treatment plots (tree species) on the upper \nterrace (6 m wide x 26 m long) were randomly allocated in each block.  Sub-\ntreatments comprising four management regimes (no pruning, root pruning, \nshoot pruning and root+shoot pruning) were imposed on the tree row \nadjacent to the main cropping area on the lower terrace.  The other tree rows \nwere not pruned to maximise woody biomass production and reflect the \nobjectives of subsistence farmers.  Sub-treatment plots (6 m wide x 5 m long) \nwere randomly allocated in each main treatment.  Sole crops were grown \ncontinuously on the lower terrace (12 m wide). \n \nAlnus and calliandra were planted in September 2000 using potted seedlings \nand sesbania was planted in March 2001 using bare-rooted seedlings.  The \nphased planting ensured that all species could be harvested simultaneously as \nsesbania, a shrubby species, matures sooner than calliandra and alnus, which \nare both trees.  A single row of each species was planted in the tree mixture.  \nBased on previous studies (Siriri and Raussen 2003), the least competitive \nspecies, sesbania, was situated adjacent to the crops, calliandra was planted in \nthe central row, and alnus, believed to be the most competitive, was grown \nfurthest from the crops.  Main and sub-plots were separated by 4 and 2 m \nwide walkways to provide access and minimise interference (Fig. 1).  \n \nA relatively mild pruning regime was chosen as a compromise between \neffective control of competition and maximum production of woody biomass \nand green manure for soil improvement.  Pruning was implemented \nsimultaneously for all tree species when calliandra and alnus were 12 months \nold and sesbania was six months old to avoid compromising the growth of \nyoung trees.  Shoot pruning involved removing all branches from the lower \nthird of the crown of trees adjacent to the cropping areas on the lower terrace \nand the sole crop plots on the upper terrace, and was repeated before each \ncropping season; prunings were returned to the plots from which they came.  \nRoot pruning was carried out to a depth of 30 cm when the trees were young \nand 50 cm when they were over three years old.  The former represents a \n 7\n183 \n184 \n185 \n186 \n187 \n188 \n189 \n190 \n191 \n192 \n193 \n194 \n195 \n196 \n197 \n198 \n199 \n200 \n201 \n202 \n203 \n204 \n205 \n206 \n207 \n208 \n209 \n210 \n211 \n212 \n213 \n214 \n \nTable 1 shows land-use systems on the upper and lower terrace for eight \ncropping seasons between March 2000 and March 2004.  In the first year, \ncrops were grown among the trees following traditional practice to maximise \noutput and shorten cropping time lost during tree fallows.  As the tree \ncanopies began to close, cropping ceased among the trees but continued on \nthe lower terrace.  Cropping followed the normal rotation in Kabale in which \nbeans (Phaseolus vulgaris cv. K132) and maize (Zea mays L. cv. H622) were \ngrown during the short and long cropping seasons.  Beans and maize were \nplanted at spacings of 50 x 10 cm and 75 x 30 cm; yields were calculated on a \nnet plot area basis.  No inorganic or organic fertilisers were applied. \n \nTree performance was assessed from observations of survival, height, basal \ndiameter and diameter at breast height (DBH) for all trees in each replicate of \nall sub-treatments; these observations began in April 2001 and were \nrepeated 24 and 36 months after tree establishment.  Crop performance on \nthe lower terrace was assessed in terms of oven-dry grain yield for material \nharvested from a net plot area (3 x 6 m), leaving a 1 m guard area at the \nboundary between adjoining pruning sub-treatment plots and at the interface \nwith the trees; row-by-row measurements examined the effect of distance \nfrom the trees.  Net plot area for sole crop plots on the upper terrace was 3 x \n4 m.  Freshly harvested grain was dried to constant weight at 80 oC.   \n \nResults were analysed using Genstat (Genstat 5 Release 6.1).  As \nconventional analysis of variance was inappropriate due to the unbalanced \nexperimental design and variability within blocks established by an initial \ncover crop of beans, the residual maximum likelihood approach (REML) was \nchosen as this provides reliable estimates of treatment effects in unbalanced \n 8\n215 \n216 \n217 \n218 \n219 \n220 \n221 \n222 \n223 \n224 \n225 \n226 \n227 \n228 \n229 \n230 \n231 \n232 \n233 \n234 \n235 \n236 \ndesigns containing more than one source of error.  In Genstat, REML uses \nlinear modelling to analyse variance components and predict means.  REML \nwas used to test for significant differences (p<0.05) in crop yield between \ntreatments.  Standard errors of the difference between means (SED) and \nstandard errors of the mean (SEM) are presented. \n \nMean values for specific treatments provided by REML may vary depending \non how treatments are structured in the analysis, providing an explanation \nfor the differing mean crop yields shown in Tables 2 and 3.  Table 2 \ncompares crop yield adjacent to unpruned trees with sole crop plots; as only \nthe unpruned treatment of all tree-based systems was included in the \nanalysis, the main treatment had one level of sub-treatment.  The treatment \nstructure (or fixed model) was covariate+main treatment, while the block \nstructure (or random model) was Block\/treatment.  Table 3 compares crop \nyields for all pruning treatments and tree species.  In this analysis, species \nand pruning regime represented the main and sub-treatments.  The \ntreatment structure (or fixed model) used was covariate+main treatment* \nsub-treatment; in both cases, the covariate was yield from the cover crop.  \nWhen the influence of distance from the trees was examined, an additional \n\u2018distance\u2019 factor was incorporated, creating a split-split plot factor within the \nanalysis. Block structure was Block\/species\/distance while treatment \nstructure was species*distance. \n 9\n 10\n237 \n238 \n239 \n240 \n241 \n242 \n243 \n244 \n245 \n246 \n247 \n248 \n249 \n250 \n251 \n252 \n253 \n254 \n255 \n256 \n257 \n258 \n259 \n260 \n261 \n262 \n263 \n264 \n265 \n266 \n267 \n268 \nResults  \n \nMean daily maximum and minimum air temperatures during the study period \nwere 24.2 and 11.7 oC (Fig. 2); maximum values were higher and minimum \nvalues lower during the dry seasons (March and July-August) than during the \nrainy seasons (April-June and September-February).  Daily saturation vapour \npressure deficit (SD) at 1500 h ranged between 0.76 and 1.79 kPa and was \ngenerally greatest during the long dry season; SD at 0800 h was invariably \n<0.2 kPa.  \n \nTree survival for calliandra and alnus exceeded 90 % and was greater than \nfor the sesbania and mixed tree systems 24 and 36 months after planting \n(p<0.001; Fig. 3a).  Survival of sesbania was 81 % at 24 months and 77 % \nat 36 months; the mixed system was intermediate between the calliandra \nand alnus systems and sole sesbania.  Despite its poorer survival, tree height \nwas greatest in sesbania at 24 and 36 months and lowest in calliandra \n(p<0.05; Fig. 3b); values for alnus and the mixed tree system were \nintermediate between these treatments. \n \nFigure 4 shows tree height, diameter at breast height (DBH) and survival in \nthe unpruned and shoot+root pruned treatments for the tree row adjacent to \nthe cropping area in the alnus, sesbania and calliandra systems.  Although \nshoot+root pruning was expected to have the greatest impact on tree \nperformance as the most severe management regime, this treatment \nincreased survival in alnus and calliandra 24 months after planting (p<0.05; \nFig. 4e) but had no effect on sesbania.  After 36 months, survival was \nunaffected by shoot+root pruning in alnus but was increased in calliandra \nand decreased in sesbania relative to unpruned trees (p<0.01; Fig. 4f).  \nMean tree height at 24 months was greatest in sesbania (p<0.01), but \ndecreased slightly between 24 and 36 months (Fig. 4a, b) due to dieback and \ndeath of some trees, whereas height in alnus increased (p<0.001); calliandra \nwas shortest at both sampling dates.  Pruning reduced height in alnus at \n269 \n270 \n271 \n272 \n273 \n274 \n275 \n276 \n277 \n278 \n279 \n280 \n281 \n282 \n283 \n284 \n285 \n286 \n287 \n288 \n289 \n290 \n291 \n292 \n293 \n294 \n295 \n296 \n297 \n298 \n299 \n300 \nboth sampling dates (p<0.05) but had no detectable effect on calliandra or \nsesbania.  Similarly, DBH did not differ significantly between species at 24 \nmonths (Fig. 4c) but was greater in unpruned than in shoot+ root pruned \nalnus at 36 months (p<0.05; Fig. 4d).   \n \nCrops grown among young trees on the upper terrace during the first two \nseasons after planting the trees showed differing responses.  Maize yield at \nmaturity during the 2000\/1 long rains did not differ significantly between sole \ncrop and agroforestry systems, although values were invariably slightly lower \nin the latter.  However, the yield of sole beans during the 2001 short rains was \napproximately twice that in the agroforestry systems even though planting \ndensities were identical (p<0.001; results not shown). \n \nTable 2 shows crop yields on the lower terrace adjacent to unpruned trees \ngrown on the upper terrace for six seasons excluding the 2003 short rains \nwhen poor rains caused crop failure.  Maize yield on the lower terrace was \nnot affected by the presence of trees during the 2000\/1 long rains, whereas \nbean yield was reduced by 39, 37, 24 and 18 % relative to the sole crop in \nthe sesbania, calliandra, alnus and mixed tree systems during the 2001 short \nrains (p<0.05).  Maize yield during the 2001\/2 long rains was reduced by \n>50 % in the calliandra treatment, but by only 2 and 12 % in the sesbania \nand alnus systems.  Similar trends occurred in the 2002 short and 2002\/3 \nlong cropping seasons and yield losses increased with time in the calliandra \nand alnus treatments.  By contrast, maize yield was greatest in the sesbania \nsystem during the 2002\/3 and 2003\/4 long rains, when the trees were over \ntwo years old.  The impact of the mixed tree system was comparable to alnus \nin all seasons. \n \nRow-by-row analysis of crop yield was used to assess spatial variation in crop \nperformance on the lower terrace adjacent to unpruned trees at distances up \nto 6 m for maize and 4 m for beans (Fig. 5).  Sampling distances differed \nbecause waterlogging of the lower terrace associated with its concave profile \n 11\n301 \n302 \n303 \n304 \n305 \n306 \n307 \n308 \n309 \n310 \n311 \n312 \n313 \n314 \n315 \n316 \n317 \n318 \n319 \n320 \n321 \nadversely affected the growth of beans, but not maize.  Yield increased with \ndistance from the trees in all treatments and seasons (p<0.001) and sole \ncrop yield also generally increased between the upper and lower terrace.  \nCrop yield was reduced within 3 m of alnus and calliandra in all seasons \n(p<0.001) but was similar to or exceeded that of sole crops at all distances \nfrom sesbania during the 2002\/3 and 2003\/4 long rains (Fig. 5d, e).  The \ntree species*distance interaction was significant during the first 18 months \nafter tree establishment (2001 short and 2001\/2 long rains) but not during \nthe 2002 short and 2002\/3 long rains as the trees grew larger, but again \nbecame significant during the 2003\/4 long rains, when the trees were three \nyears old. \n \nPruning alnus and calliandra generally increased maize yield (p<0.05-0.001; \nTable 3) although there was no consistent difference between pruning \ntreatments.  Root+shoot pruning became increasingly effective as the trees \naged (p<0.05).  Maize benefitted more from root pruning than shoot pruning \nof alnus at 18 months, but the reverse applied at 30 months.  Pruning \nsesbania did not improve crop yield except for maize in the root+shoot \npruning treatment of sole sesbania and the mixed tree system during the \n2003\/4 long rains.  Pruning provided no significant benefit for beans in either \nof the seasons examined.   \n 12\n 13\n322 \n323 \n324 \n325 \n326 \n327 \n328 \n329 \n330 \n331 \n332 \n333 \n334 \n335 \n336 \n337 \n338 \n339 \n340 \n341 \n342 \n343 \n344 \n345 \n346 \n347 \n348 \n349 \n350 \n351 \n352 \nDiscussion \n \nMonthly rainfall was greatest during the first half of the long rains \n(September-November) in all four years (Fig. 2).  Daily maximum SD did not \nexceed 1.8 kPa, reflecting the humid environment of tropical highland areas \nsuch as Kabale.  Seasonal trends for daily maximum air temperature showed \nless variation than those for minimum temperature; maximum values were \ngreatest and minimum values lowest during the dry seasons due to the \ngreater radiative exchange associated with limited cloud cover. \n \nTree survival was lower in sesbania than in alnus or calliandra 24 and 36 \nmonths after planting, but height was greatest in sesbania (Fig. 3).  Unlike \nalnus and calliandra, which are trees, sesbania is a short-lived deciduous \nshrub (Katende et al. 1995).  Although some reports suggest 12-18 months \nis sufficient to reach maturity (Kwesiga and Coe 1994), there is no universal \nrecommendation for its optimal growth period as this depends on planting \npattern and density and farmers\u2019 objectives.  The growth period used here \nmay have exceeded the optimum for sesbania in improved fallows, increasing \nmortality.  The increased survival of calliandra after pruning (Fig. 4) reflects \nresponses seen in previous studies in which pruning young trees enhanced \nsurvival and biomass production, whereas older trees showed increased \nmortality due to their lower re-growth capacity (ICRAF 1994).  Although \nshoot pruning of alnus has been linked to increases in stem diameter and \nadvocated as a strategy for improving timber production in Kabale (Sande \n2002), root+shoot pruning reduced tree height and DBH in the present study \n(Fig. 4), and hence woody biomass production.  In humid Kerala, \nChandrashekara (2007) reported that shoot pruning may increase annual \nbranch and foliage production without affecting DBH, even under more \nsevere pruning regimes than applied here.  This contrast may reflect \ndifferences in tree age, soil depth and fertility and pruning frequency. \n \n353 \n354 \n355 \n356 \n357 \n358 \n359 \n360 \n361 \n362 \n363 \n364 \n365 \n366 \n367 \n368 \n369 \n370 \n371 \n372 \n373 \n374 \n375 \n376 \n377 \n378 \n379 \n380 \n381 \n382 \n383 \n384 \nThe absence of significant yield reductions when maize was intercropped with \ntrees on the upper terrace during the 2000\/1 long rains suggests that crops \nmay be integrated with trees during establishment of agroforestry systems, \nparticularly when tall species such as maize, which compete effectively for \nabove-ground resources, are used.  The observation that the more rapid \ninitial growth of alnus relative to calliandra tended to depress crop yield \n(p<0.01) contrasts with reports that alnus is less competitive than other tree \nspecies (ICRAF 1995).  Bean yield in the agroforestry systems was \napproximately half that of sole crops (p<0.001) during the 2001 short rains \nwhen the tree canopies began to close, shading understorey crops.  Crop \nperformance may also have been affected by competition for water (Lott et al. \n2000) as rainfall was lower than in the 2000\/1 long rains (Fig. 2).  \n \nMaize yield on the lower terrace was unaffected by unpruned trees on the \nupper terrace during the 2000\/1 long rains (Table 2) as the trees were still \ntoo young (c. 6 months) to influence associated crops.  Lott et al (2000) \nreported a similar lack of effect during establishment of systems containing \nGrevillea robusta and maize in semi-arid Kenya, although the competitive \ninfluence of trees increased as they grew larger and was closely correlated \nwith rainfall.  Sesbania was most competitive during the 2001 short rains \n(Table 2) but subsequently lost leaves, reducing competition with associated \ncrops; maize yield in the sesbania system was similar to or greater than in \nsole maize during the 2001\/2, 2002\/3 and 2003\/4 seasons.  Bean yield was \nalso greatest in the sesbania treatment during the 2002 short rains. \n \nSeasonal variation in climatic conditions influenced the impact of trees, \nparticularly during the 2002 short rains, when crop yield was lower in all \ntree-based systems than in sole crops (p<0.05; Table 2).  Siriri and Raussen \n(2003) noted that the differing effects of various tree species on crop \nperformance was less obvious in low rainfall seasons, suggesting that water \nuse differs little between tree species when water supplies are limited as \ntheir optimal requirements are not being met, whereas inter-specific \n 14\n385 \n386 \n387 \n388 \n389 \n390 \n391 \n392 \n393 \n394 \n395 \n396 \n397 \n398 \n399 \n400 \n401 \n402 \n403 \n404 \n405 \n406 \n407 \n408 \n409 \n410 \n411 \n412 \n413 \n414 \n415 \n416 \nvariation in the regulation of transpiration becomes important when water is \nfreely available. \n  \nThe marked increase in crop yield with distance from unpruned trees in all \nseasons (Fig. 5) illustrates their potentially detrimental impact, although it \nshould be noted that this trend resulted not only from the decreasing \ncompetitive influence of the trees, but also from increasing fertility across the \nterrace (Raussen et al. 1999; Siriri and Raussen 2003).  The latter is evident \nfrom the increase in sole crop yield with distance from the notional tree line \nfor all except the 2001 short rains.  A possible explanation for the \nobservation that the tree species*distance interaction was significant during \nthe first 18 months after tree establishment (2001 short and 2001\/2 long \nrains), but disappeared during the 2002 short and 2002\/3 long rains is that \nthe root systems of all tree species increased in size with time, extending \ntheir influence over an increasing proportion of the lower terrace and \neliminating the species differences initially observed.  The reappearance of a \nsignificant species*distance interaction during the 2003\/4 long rains, when \nthe trees were three years old, may reflect their contrasting growth \ncharacteristics.  While sesbania was shedding leaves and showed stem \ndieback, unpruned calliandra and alnus trees were extending their canopies \nand shading adjacent crops; the roots of unpruned trees may also have \nextended further into cropping area, increasing the intensity of below-ground \ncompetition.  \n  \nFigure 5 suggests that calliandra requires careful management as almost \ncomplete crop failure occurred within 4 m of the trees during the 2002\/3 and \n2003\/4 long rains.  Crop yield adjacent to unpruned trees generally \ndecreased with time, probably due to increased competition and declining soil \nfertility caused by continuous cropping on the lower terrace without addition \nof inorganic fertiliser or green manure, supporting previous reports of the \nunsustainability of traditional continuous cropping systems (Siriri and \nRaussen 2003).  However, it should be noted that suitably managed \n 15\n417 \n418 \n419 \n420 \n421 \n422 \n423 \n424 \n425 \n426 \n427 \n428 \n429 \n430 \n431 \n432 \n433 \n434 \n435 \n436 \n437 \n438 \n439 \n440 \n441 \n442 \n443 \n444 \n445 \n446 \n447 \n448 \nrotational woodlots on the degraded upper terrace benches may provide \nvaluable services for subsistence farmers, including provision of timber, \npoles, fuelwood, fodder and mulch without seriously compromising food \nproduction, as the upper terrace provides only 5-10 % of total yield when the \nentire terrace is planted with maize or beans.  When woodlots on the upper \nterrace are harvested, cropping may resume until improvements in soil \nconditions produced by the trees are exhausted, when the cycle \nrecommences (Siriri and Raussen 2003).   \n \nRoot, shoot or root+shoot pruning of alnus and calliandra generally increased \ncrop yield on the lower terrace relative to unpruned treatments for maize but \nnot for beans (Table 3); the beneficial influence of pruning generally ranked \nin the order alnus>calliandra>tree mixture>sesbania.  The yield advantage \nof pruning calliandra and alnus increased as the trees grew larger and \ncompetition increased.  The results suggest that shoot pruning provides an \neffective management strategy to limit the competitive impact of alnus on \nassociated crops but root+shoot pruning is required for calliandra.  The \nlimited yield improvement provided by pruning sesbania is unlikely to be \nattractive as the labour input required would negate any economic benefit.   \n \nThe modest crop yield responses observed may reflect the conservative tree \nshoot pruning regime adopted relative to those advocated by \nChandrashekara (2007) in Kerala, i.e. removal of 50-90 % of the canopy; the \npresent pruning regimes were designed to minimise labour requirements and \navoid compromising production of fuelwood and green manure for soil \nimprovement.  As only the lower third of the canopy was removed from the \ntree row adjacent to sole crops, this may have been insufficient to eliminate \ncompetition for light.  Jackson et al. (2000) noted that a similar pruning \nregime produced no significant improvement in maize yield in systems \ncontaining Grevillea robusta in Western Kenya.  Moreover, the trees were \npruned prior to the cropping season, compared to four times annually \nrecommended for systems containing Senna spectabilis and maize in Eastern \n 16\n449 \n450 \n451 \n452 \n453 \n454 \n455 \n456 \n457 \n458 \n459 \n460 \n461 \n462 \n463 \n464 \n465 \n466 \n467 \n468 \n469 \n470 \n471 \n472 \n473 \n474 \n475 \n476 \n477 \n478 \n479 \n480 \nKenya (Namirembe et al., 2009); nevertheless, the results show that \nrelatively mild shoot pruning of alnus and calliandra may increase maize \nyield, while root pruning induced significant responses even when a shallow \npruning depth was used to ensure this could be achieved using the hoes \nreadily available to subsistence farmers for land preparation and \nmaintenance. \n \nInteractions between tree species, pruning regimes and effects on associated \ncrops have been reported previously in the semi-arid and sub-humid tropics.  \nThus, Jones et al. (1998) found that removal of half of the crown of Prosopis \njuliflora trees grown at 5 m spacings in semi-arid Nigeria reduced their \ncompetitive impact on sorghum and increased grain yield at all distances \nfrom the trees, whereas pruning of Acacia nilotica had little effect; crown \npruning not only decreased competition for above-ground resources, but also \nreduced root length density in P. juliflora and competition for below-ground \nresources.  The reductions in root length density in P. juliflora were \naccompanied by corresponding increases in sorghum, tipping the balance of \nbelow-ground competition in favour of the crop component.  Root pruning of \nG. robusta and A. acuminata in semi-arid Kenya to a depth of 0.6 m at a \ndistance of 0.5 m from the tree rows decreased rooting density in the surface \nsoil horizons and greatly reduced water use for nine months after pruning \n(Ong et al. 2007).  The reduction in sap flow was most pronounced when \ntranspiration was greatest, especially in the more rapidly transpiring \ngrevillea; daily transpiration rates nine months after pruning were reduced \nby 25-35 % in root-pruned trees of both species.  However, Wajja-Muskwe \net al. (2008) reported that root pruning five years after planting various tree \nspecies, including A. acuminata, on deep soils in humid Uganda improved \ncrop yield by 10 % within 0-7 m of the tree rows but reduced yield on the \nunpruned side of the tree rows, with the result that there was no overall \nbenefit.  Thus, whilst root pruning at the interface between trees and crops \non terraces was effective in the present study, the application of one-sided \npruning in other systems may simply redirect competitive interactions. \n 17\n481 \n482 \n483 \n484 \n485 \n486 \n487 \n488 \n489 \n490 \n491 \n492 \n493 \n494 \n495 \n496 \n497 \n498 \n499 \n500 \n501 \n502 \n503 \n504 \n505 \nConclusions \nPrevious research suggests that shoot pruning reduces above-ground \ncompetition and may limit competition by inducing root mortality and \nredirecting the partitioning of assimilates in favour of shoot regrowth during \ncrop establishment.  The present study shows that short-lived sesbania \nfallows may be grown on the upper section of terraces with little impact on \ncrop yield on the lower terrace, although pruning of alnus and calliandra was \nessential to sustain crop yield.  Root+shoot pruning was generally effective in \ncontrolling competition, whereas the relatively light shoot pruning imposed \nwas ineffective for calliandra.  As expected, the tree mixture had \nintermediate effects on crop yield.  The relatively mild pruning regimes used \ndid not entirely eliminate competition between trees and crops, and beans \nwere more sensitive than maize.  The contrasting responses of these species \nmay reflect differing growth conditions during the short and long rains as the \nlower rainfall and its poorer distribution in the former may have restricted \nthe ability of beans to respond to reduced competition induced by pruning.  \nAs the impact of pruning on tree\/crop interactions differs between species, \ncareful selection and management are vital to determine the success of \nagroforestry systems, particularly when water supplies are limiting. \n \nAcknowledgements \nWe thank the International Foundation for Science and USAID for funding, \nThomas Raussen and Richard Coe for expert assistance with experimental \ndesign and statistical analysis, and Posiano Nteziryayo for trial management \nand data collection.  \n 18\n 19\n506 \n507 \n508 \n509 \n510 \n511 \n512 \n513 \n514 \n515 \n516 \n517 \n518 \n519 \n520 \n521 \n522 \n523 \n524 \n525 \n526 \n527 \n528 \n529 \n530 \n531 \n532 \n533 \n534 \n535 \n536 \n537 \nReferences \n \nAgus F, Cassel DK, Garrity DP (1997) Soil-water and soil physical properties \nunder contour hedgerows on sloping oxisols.
