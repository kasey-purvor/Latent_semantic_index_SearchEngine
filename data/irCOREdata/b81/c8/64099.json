The WHAM\/Model VI model has previously been used to simulate pH 13 \nbuffering and Al solubility in acid soils, and metal partitioning in highly organic soils, but 14 \nhas not previously been applied to agricultural soils. Here we have extended 15 \nWHAM\/Model VI framework to include surface complexation to oxides and cation 16 \nexchange, and applied it to batch titrations of limed agricultural soils contaminated by 17 \nemissions of Cd and Zn from a metal smelter. In contrast to previous studies on forest 18 \nsoils, model predictions were most sensitive to the size of the geochemically \u2018active\u2019 soil 19 \nCa pool. Following optimisation of this pool the model reproduced trends in pH and major 20 \ncations well. Blind predictions of soil metal (Cu, Zn, and Cd), using estimates of the active 21 \nsoil metal obtained by extraction with 0.22 M HNO3, were mostly very reasonable. Where 22 \npredicted metal solubility was biased the model could be fitted to the data by optimising 23 \nthe size of the active metal pool.  In some cases the optimised metal pool was 24 \nunrealistically large, indicating a possible deficiency in the way the model considers 25 \nbinding activity and competition. Organic matter was the dominant binding phase in these 26 \nsoils. These results support the contention that speciation modelling has great promise in 27 \nproviding a holistic description of ionic chemistry in soils for both major and trace 28 \nelements. 29 \nIntroduction 30 \nMetal contamination in soils may pose risks to humans and the environment by a number 31 \nof pathways, from uptake of metal by crop plants to direct effects on the soil microbial 32 \nbiomass. Rigorously assessing such risks requires understanding of the processes 33 \ncontrolling the mobility, bioaccumulation and toxicity of metals.  In all cases, the processes 34 \n 3 \ncontrolling the concentrations and speciation of me tal in the soil solution are key.   35 \nDownward and lateral movement of metals to surface and groundwater occurs largely by 36 \ntransport in the soil solution. Evidence also strongly suggests that metal speciation in the 37 \nsoil solution controls bioavailability and toxicity to soil organisms (Sauv\u00e9 2002), although 38 \ngeneralisations must be made with caution since metal uptake routes and regulation 39 \nprocesses do vary among organisms.  The solid\u2013solution partitioning of metals in soils is 40 \ncommonly quantified by the partition coefficient (Kd) since this is a common parameter in 41 \nmany environmental fate models, or by isotherms such as the Langmuir for which 42 \nparameters can be obtained in the laboratory. However, there is doubt as to whether Kd 43 \nvalues obtained in laboratory experiments using manipulated soil can be realistically 44 \ntransferred to field conditions, due to variations in key parameters such as the soil:water 45 \nratio and the solution pH between the field and laboratory.  Neither can Kds or simple 46 \nisotherms describe the changes in metal partitioning that might result from secondary 47 \neffects such as soil acidification.  Speciation models (e.g. Windermere Humic Aqueous 48 \nModel, WHAM (Tipping 1994; Tipping 1998) that include descriptions of the chemistry of 49 \nsoil solid phases and solution ligands provide a mechanistic alternative to the use of Kds or 50 \nisotherms.  Such models are parameterised on laboratory experiments with isolated or 51 \nsynthetic solid phases and ligands and so represent a synthesis of theoretical knowledge for 52 \ntesting against the behaviour of multicomponent systems such as soils.  Several authors 53 \nhave applied speciation models to laboratory studies of soil metal solubility (e.g. (Lofts et 54 \nal. 2001a; Dijkstra et al. 2004; Lumsdon 2004; Fest et al. 2005; Ponizovsky et al. 2006)) 55 \nwith reasonable success.   A key finding, reinforced by a number of studies, is the 56 \nimportance of natural organic matter as a binding phase in many soils. The complex 57 \nchemistry of natural organic matter has presented a significant challenge to modellers, but 58 \nin recent years sophisticated models for organic matter have been developed, of which the 59 \n 4 \nmost prominent are the non- ideal competitive adsorption (NICA-Donnan) model 60 \n(Kinniburgh et al. 1996) and Humic Ion Binding Models V and VI (Tipping & Hurley 61 \n1992; Tipping 1998). As a component of the WHAM speciation model (Tipping 1994), 62 \nModels V and VI have previously been used to model proton solubility and Al speciation 63 \nin forest soils (deWit et al. 1999; Lofts et al. 2001a) and the speciation of radionuclides 64 \nand trace metals in upland English soils (Tipping et al. 1995; Tipping et al. 2003).  All 65 \nthese studies have focused on speciation and solubility in acid organic soils, where organic 66 \nmatter can robustly be assumed to comprise the solid phase component controlling the 67 \nsolution chemistry (including metal speciation and partitioning).  Applications of the 68 \nmodel to soils lower in organic matter, and soils of circumneutral pH, have also been made 69 \nbut on a more limited basis (e.g. (Ponizovsky et al. 2006).  There is thus a need to extend 70 \nthe assessment of the model to such soils. 71 \nThe purpose of this study was to extend the current soil version of WHAM (Tipping et al. 72 \n2003) to consider soil solid phases other than organic matter when modelling major ion 73 \nand trace metal partitioning, and to apply the model to agricultural soils collected in an 74 \narea in Norway influenced by a local zinc smelter.  The aquatic version of the model has 75 \nbeen previously extended to consider solid phases in aquatic suspended particulate matter 76 \n(Lofts & Tipping 1998; Lofts & Tipping 2000).  The soils version of the model developed 77 \nhere is rather similar but also includes precipitation reactions for aluminium and iron(III), 78 \nboth of which elements are important influences on trace metal speciation (Tipping et al. 79 \n2002). Following on from previous studies we firstly seek a description of pH and the 80 \nmajor ion concentrations in the soil solutions prior to modelling the solubility of the trace 81 \nmetals. 82 \n 83 \n 5 \nMaterials and methods  84 \nSite description 85 \nThe sampling area is along the \u201cS\u00f8rfjorden\u201d fjord near Odda, western Norway (370 km 86 \nwest of Oslo). Due to the topography (Figure 1) local deposition from industry, including 87 \nthe zinc smelter, occurs largely to the valley floor. The zinc smelter was established in 88 \n1924 and is the main source of Cd and Zn contamination of local soils (Steinnes et al. 89 \n2001).  The locations of the sampling sites are shown in Figure 1 and soil properties are 90 \ngiven in Table 1. Samples were collected at 2-5 cm depth and subsequently stored moist 91 \nand cold (at 4\u00b0C). Site #1 is an old orchard located 12.3 km north of the zinc smelter, 92 \nwhereas sites #3 and #8 are within a 1 km radius from the smelter. Site #4, located about 5 93 \nkm south of the smelter and partly hidden from it by mountains, has intensive grass 94 \nproduction for domestic animals. Site #3 is an actively managed orchard site, whereas site 95 \n#8 is a garden lawn. Sites #4 and 8 are frequently limed (every 5-7 yr) to maintain 96 \nfavourable soil pH for grass.  97 \n 98 \nSoil analysis 99 \nSoils were subjected to two extractions for trace metals, using aqua regia and 0.22 M 100 \nHNO3, respectively. Subsamples were pulverized by an agate mortar and digested with 101 \naqua regia (3:1 concentrated HCl: concentrated HNO3) in \u201cErlenmeyer\u201d flasks. Digestion 102 \ncomprised an initial short parboiling, cooling and resting for about 16 hours, boiling for 2 103 \nhours, evaporation to dryness, and dissolution in 10% HNO3 (reagent grade). The extract 104 \nconcentrations of Cd were determined using a Perkin-Elmer graphite furnace atomic 105 \nabsorption spectrophotometer (AAS, Perkin-Elmer, Norwalk, CT), whereas for the 106 \ndetermination of Cu and Zn, a Thermo Jarrell Ash inductive coupled plasma (ICP, Thermo 107 \n 6 \nJarrell Ash, Franklin, MA) was used. Two grams of field moist soil were shaken in 35 ml 108 \n0.22 M HNO3 overnight and the solutions filtered through Whatman glass fibre filters, 109 \nGF\/C (1.2\u00b5m). Filtrate metal concentrations were determined using a Quadropole 110 \nInductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) (Perkin Elmer Elan 6000). Soil 111 \npH was measured in deionised water at a solid:solution ratio of 1:2.5. Acid oxalate and 112 \npyrophosphate extractable Fe and Al were determined, after the methods of Saunders 113 \n(1965) and Bascomb (1968) respectively. Copper chloride\u2013extractable Al was determined 114 \nafter (Juo & Kamprath 1979). Aluminium and Fe concentrations were determined using an 115 \natomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS, Perkin-Elmer, Norwalk, CT). Exchangeable 116 \nbase cations and exchangeable acidity (extracted by 1.0 M NH4NO3) were also measured. 117 \nBase cation concentrations were determined using an ICP (Thermo Jarrell Ash, Franklin, 118 \nMA). Exchangeable acidity was determined by titration with NaOH to pH 7.00. Cation 119 \nExchange Capacity (CEC) was computed as the sum of exchangeable base cations and 120 \nacidity. The inorganic carbon was determined as the difference between total carbon in soil 121 \nand total organic carbon. Parallel soil samples were repeatedly washed with 2 M HCl to 122 \nremove inorganic carbon, before total organic carbon was determined using a LECO CHN 123 \n-1000 analyser. (Leco, St. Joseph, MI). The particle size distribution was measured using 124 \nthe pipette method of Elonen (1971).  125 \n 126 \nBatch titration 127 \nBetween four and six subsamples (20 g) of each field moist soil were suspended in <50 ml 128 \n0.01 M NaCl to which small volumes of NaOH (0.1 M) or HCl (1.0 M or 0.1 M) were added 129 \nto adjust pH. The final total solution volume was 50.0 ml, including the soil water, 0.01 M 130 \nNaCl extract and acid\/base added to adjust pH. The volumes of acid and base were chosen, 131 \nbased on range\u2013finding tests, to achieve a final pH range of 1\u20132 units above and below that 132 \n 7 \npH obtained without addition of acid or base (the ambient pH).  Soil\u2013solution mixtures 133 \nwere shaken continuously (100 strokes min-1) for 55 hours, and the supernatants removed 134 \nand filtered through Whatman glass fibre filters, GF\/C, 1.2 \u00b5m).  No attempt was made to 135 \nexclude the atmosphere from the samples during the experiments. The pH and 136 \nconcentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), Mg, Al, K, Ca, Cu, Zn, and Cd were 137 \nmeasured in the supernatants. Metal concentrations were determined using a Quadropole 138 \nInductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) (Perkin Elmer Elan 6000). A 139 \nShimadzu TOC-5000 analyser (Shimadzu Scientific, Columbia, MD) was used to 140 \ndetermine supernatant DOC. pH was measured using a combination electrode. 141 \n  142 \nModelling 143 \nHumic Ion Binding Model VI 144 \nA full description of Humic Ion Binding Model VI (hereafter referred to as Model VI) is 145 \ngiven by Tipping (1998). Briefly, Model VI is a discrete site\/electrostatic model for 146 \nsimulating cation binding to humic substances. Binding of cations can occur either at 147 \ndiscrete binding sites (specific binding) or electrostatic accumulation adjacent to the 148 \nmolecular surface.  Heterogeneity of binding is provided for by having a number of distinct 149 \nsite types each with its own binding strength.  The range of metal binding strengths is 150 \nextended by allowing multidentate binding at specific combinations of two and three sites, 151 \nand further by empirically increasing the binding strengths of subsets of these sites.  152 \nBinding strengths are further modified by the (electrostatic) effect of charge development 153 \nat the molecular surface resulting from ion binding and release.  Electrostatic accumulation 154 \nof ions adjacent to the molecular surfaces (non\u2013specific binding) is simulated using 155 \nDonnan type expressions.  The relative affinity of ions for accumulation may be adjusted 156 \n 8 \nusing selectivity coefficients.  Here we have set the selectivity coefficients for the ions 157 \nNa+, Mg2+, Al3+, AlOH2+ and Al(OH)2+ to 0.25, 0.75, 0.5, 0.5 and 0.5 respectively, after 158 \nTipping et al., (1995). All other ions have selectivity coefficients of unity. 159 \nFor the purposes of modelling, humic substances are conceptually divided into humic and 160 \nfulvic acids, each having their own distinct parameter sets.  The metal binding equilibrium 161 \nconstants have been derived by calibrating to the available literature data (Tipping 1998). 162 \nThese constants are regarded as \u201cbest average\u201d values.  163 \nMineral surfaces 164 \nWe have chosen three mineral surfaces for modelling: iron oxide, aluminium oxide and an 165 \nidealised clay cation\u2013exchanger.  Iron and aluminium oxide surface chemistry are 166 \nsimulated by a surface complexation model originally used by Lofts and Tipping (1998) as 167 \na component of the SCAMP (Surface Chemistry Assemblage Model for Particles) model 168 \nfor aquatic suspended particulate matter.  In this model the oxide surfaces possess 169 \namphoteric hydroxyl groups.  These groups are homogenous with respect to the strengths 170 \nof proton binding and release. Metals can bind monodentately to any surface group.  Metal 171 \nbinding is heterogeneous, with three metal binding strengths: strong, medium and weak, 172 \napplying to 0.9%, 9% and 90.1% of the surface groups respectively. We assume the oxides 173 \nto be in large surface area, amorphous forms; surface areas were set to the default values of 174 \n0.6 m2 kg-1 and 0.4 m2 kg-1 for iron and aluminium oxides respectively.  Electrostatic 175 \neffects on ion binding, and electrostatic accumulation of ions adjacent to the surface, are 176 \nhandled by submodels similar to those found in Model VI.  Parameters for proton and 177 \nmetal binding are those calculated by Lofts and Tipping (1998). 178 \n 179 \n 9 \nCation binding to the idealised cation\u2013exchanger is calculated using the model introduced 180 \nby Tipping (1994).  Binding is by electrostatic accumulation only, using Donnan type 181 \nexpressions.  Selectivity of binding is possible, but is not invoked here.  Binding capacity 182 \nis expressed by a surface charge density (in cmolc kg-1) and a specific surface area (in 183 \nm2 kg-1). 184 \nModelling system 185 \nModel VI, the surface complexation model, cation exchanger model and a solution 186 \nspeciation submodel were combined as shown in Figure 2.  Organic matter, comprising 187 \nhumic and fulvic acids, can be present in the solid phase as soil organic matter (SOM) or in 188 \nthe solution phase as dissolved organic matter (DOM).  The default binding parameters in 189 \nall the models were not adjusted in this study.  The relationship between the measured 190 \namounts of organic matter on the soil solids, and the amounts of humic and fulvic acid 191 \ninput to the model to represent these phases, can be set a priori or input as fitting 192 \nparameters. Input Al and Fe(III) can be specified as a mixture of \u2018fixed\u2019 hydroxides that 193 \nhave chemically active surfaces but cannot dissolve, and of \u2018active\u2019 element that can 194 \nparticipate in solution and surface equilibria.  The latter if desired can precipitate as 195 \nhydroxides, and if desired the precipitates can possess chemically active surfaces. 196 \nHydroxide precipitation is simulated by conventional solubility products (Ksp = aM.aH-3); 197 \nwe use standard log solubility products of 8.5 and 2.7 for Al(OH)3 and Fe(OH)3 198 \nrespectively, and standard enthalpies of precipitation of -107 kJ mol-1 and -102 kJ mol-1, 199 \nafter Tipping et al. (2003) and Tipping et al. (2002) respectively.  The carbonate system 200 \nmay be modelled by assuming equilibrium with atmospheric carbon dioxide or by 201 \ninputting a measure of the amount of carbonate present. Given that we were attempting to 202 \nmodel limed soils, additional code was written to allow the simulation of calcite (CaCO3) 203 \nprecipitation and dissolution.  The standard log solubility product (Ksp = aCa.aCO3) and 204 \n 10 \nstandard enthalpy of precipitation used were -8.48 and -8 kJ mol-1, respectively (Smith et 205 \nal. 2004). 206 \nResults 207 \nCharacteristics of the investigated soils 208 \nAll the soils are sandy loams, but due to the different vegetation covers, management 209 \npractices and distances from the smelter, the soil chemical properties vary (Tables 1 and 2). 210 \nSignificant variations in the contents of TOC, exchangeable Ca and CuCl2 extractable Al 211 \nwere seen. The Ca accounted for between 75 and 96% of the total CEC. The two largest 212 \npH values were found in soils collected from the sites #4 and #8. Both sites are frequently 213 \nlimed (every 5-7 yr), and the relative contribution of Ca to CEC was also the highest in 214 \nthese two soils (Table 2). The content of organic C is lowest in soil #4. The two soils 215 \nadjacent to the smelter, #3 and #8, had the highest metal (Cu, Zn, Cd) contents (Table 3). 216 \nOf the two remoter sites, #1 had higher metal contents than #4 as a result of its location 217 \ndownwind of the smelter. 218 \nCompared with soils sampled from a forest site in southern Norway (Birkenes) (Lofts et al. 219 \n2001a) soils #4 and #8 were notably enriched in exchangeable Ca relative to copper\u2013220 \nextractable Al.  Ratios of Ca:Al in soils #4 and #8 were 19 and 23 compared to 2 and 0.2 in 221 \nthe Birkenes Oe and Oa horizons. The ratios in soils #1 and #3 were similar to those at 222 \nBirkenes at 0.8 and 2.1 respectively. 223 \nBatch titrations 224 \nThe observed pH and Ca, DOC, major ions (Mg, K, Al) and trace metals (Cu, Zn, Cd) in 225 \nthe batch titration supernatants are shown in Figures 3, 4, 5 and 6 respectively.  226 \nSupernatant pH (Figure 3) varied by between two and a half and four pH units depending 227 \nupon the soil. Dissolved organic carbon concentrations (Figure 4) varied considerably with 228 \n 11 \nacid\/base addition. The minimum DOC concentration was observed in the ambient 229 \nsystems, except for soil #8 where the DOC at the lowest acid addition was marginally 230 \nlower than that in the ambient system. In all soils the DOC increased considerably when 231 \nthe base-acid > 0. This has been previously ascribed (Lofts et al. 2001b) to solubilisation 232 \nof increasingly hydrophobic organic matter due to progressive deprotonation as the pH is 233 \nincreased. Appreciable increases in DOC were also seen in soils #4 and #8 after acid 234 \naddition; this has tentatively been ascribed (Lofts et al. 2001a) to solubilisation of a portion 235 \nof the SOM able to bind large amounts of Al and having a net positive charge.  Major ion 236 \nand trace metal solubility varied considerably, both with pH in single soils and among the 237 \nmetals as a proportion of the active pool.  Dissolved K varied by up to an order of 238 \nmagnitude depending upon the soil, Mg and Ca by between one and two orders of 239 \nmagnitude, Al and the trace metals by up to three orders of magnitude.  At the smallest pH, 240 \nthe dissolved concentrations of Mg, K, Ca, Zn and Cd approached or even reached those 241 \nexpected to result from complete dissolution of the bound metal (as estimated by the 242 \nvarious extractions).  Dissolved Al and Cu concentrations were notably variable among 243 \nsoils, with solubility relative to the bound pools being relatively large in soil #1, at large 244 \npH for both metals and for Al at small pH. In contrast, both metals showed rather low 245 \nsolubility in soil 8, with the highest solution concentration representing less than 10% of 246 \nthe \u2018active\u2019 pool, and only about 1% in the case of Cu.  The highest Cu concentrations 247 \nwere consistently associated with the large pH end of the titrations, in association with 248 \nlarge DOM concentrations.  The relative importance of supernatant DOM complexation 249 \nwas seen in the correlations between solution metals (in particular Al and Cu) and DOC 250 \nconcentrations (both expressed as logarithms) \u2013 correlation coefficients for Mg, Al, K, Ca, 251 \nCu, Zn and Cd were -0.51, 0.80, -0.13, -0.41, 0.93, 0.03 and -0.01 respectively. 252 \n 12 \nThese trends in solubility may be interpreted in terms of the binding mechanisms of the 253 \nmetals, and their relative tendencies to bind to solid and dissolved phase ligands. 254 \nPotassium does not form solution complexes and binds to solid phases by cation exchange; 255 \nthus competition by protons is less important than it is for cations that bind to specific 256 \nsites, and  the variation in solubility with pH is small.  Both Mg and Ca can bind 257 \nspecifically in competition with protons, and so the pH dependence of binding is greater 258 \nthan seen for K. The increase in solubility of these metals above pH 6 in soil #1 may be 259 \nattributed to solubilisation of organic matter (Figure 4) and its bound metals. This effect 260 \nbecomes more important when considering Zn and Cd, and particularly so for Al and Cu, 261 \nwhich would be expected to bind predominantly by specific complexation. Copper in 262 \nparticular exhibits strong binding to both solid phase and dissolved ligands, even at the low 263 \nend of the studied pH ranges. This results in the observed maximum solubility at the 264 \nlargest pH that is seen particularly in soils #4 and #8. Here the Cu is likely to be 265 \npredominantly DOM-complexed. Dijkstra et al. (2004) reported the same pH dependency 266 \nof metal solubility in soil extracts, with a minimum dissolved metal in the pH 4-6 range. 267 \nModelling stage 1: solubility controls on Al and Fe(III) 268 \nSolution concentrations of Al and Fe(III) were input to the model along with pH, Mg, K, 269 \nCa, Cl and DOM.  DOM was assumed to comprise 65% fulvic acid and 35% chemically 270 \ninert material, after Bryan et al. (2002); this assumption was used throughout.  No 271 \nmeasurements of solution anions other than Cl (e.g. SO4) were available. Given that the 272 \nelectrolyte Cl  ought to dominate the solution anions, such other anions were not 273 \nconsidered.  The carbonate system was assumed to be in equilibrium with atmospheric 274 \nCO2, at a partial pressure of 34.96Pa (3.45 \u00d7 10-4 atm). Speciation was done by adjusting 275 \nthe Na concentration to force charge balance.  Saturation indices (SIs) were initially 276 \ncalculated for hydroxides of Al and Fe(III), using the solubility parameters given in the 277 \n 13 \nModelling system section. Log SIs for Al(OH)3 ranged from -3.7 to 3.9 and for Fe(OH)3 278 \nfrom -0.5 to 5.9. Thus supersaturation with respect to both minerals was predicted, 279 \nalthough for Al the degree of under\u2013 or oversaturation was highly pH\u2013dependent. We 280 \ninterpret these finding to  indicate the presence of colloidal forms of the minerals in the 281 \nsupernatants, as has been assumed previously (e.g. Tipping et al. 2003).  All subsequent 282 \ncalculations were therefore done allowing Al(OH)3 (s) and Fe(OH)3 (s) to precipitate. 283 \nModelling stage 2: solubility controls on Ca 284 \nThe aim of this stage was to examine the possibility that in these limed soils, a solid 285 \ncalcium\u2013containing phase may control the supernatant pH and dissolved Ca.  For this 286 \npurpose we chose calcite (CaCO3) as a model phase, since it is the most soluble of the 287 \ncalcium carbonates.  We also assumed that allthe measured inorganic C was present as 288 \ncalcite. We then predicted supernatant pH and Ca under three scenarios: 289 \n1. Exchangeable calcium and calcite assumed to be \u2018active\u2019, i.e. participating in 290 \nsolubility and complexation reactions, in a closed system. 291 \n2. As scenario 1, in an open system, i.e. in equilibrium with atmospheric CO2 at a 292 \npartial pressure of 34.96Pa (3.45 \u00d7 10-4 atm). 293 \n3. As scenario 2, but with calcite not assumed to be \u2018active\u2019, i.e. the \u2018active\u2019 Ca was 294 \nset to the measured exchangeable value. 295 \nIn scenarios 1 and 2 the total \u2018active\u2019 calcium input to the model was the sum of the 296 \nmeasured exchangeable pool and the pool assumed to be initially present in calcite, which 297 \nwas calculated from the measured amount of soil inorganic C. In scenario 1 the total 298 \ncarbonate was also calculated from the soil inorganic C.  For the open system in scenarios 299 \n2 and 3 a total carbonate was not defined.  The modelling also required inputs of solid 300 \nphase concentrations and pools of \u2018active\u2019 elements that can partition between solid and 301 \n 14 \nsolution.  Pools of Mg and K were taken as the exchangeable values.  For Al, we chose to 302 \ninput two pools: a fixed pool of aluminium hydroxide calculated by the difference between 303 \nthe oxalate\u2013 and copper\u2013extractable amounts, and an \u2018active\u2019 pool, equal to the copper\u2013304 \nextractable amount.  This is consistent with previous studies where at small pH soil Al 305 \nsolubility has been shown to be controlled by the organically\u2013bound pool (Berggren & 306 \nMulder 1995), which is approximated by the copper chloride extraction.  The \u2018active\u2019 pool 307 \nwas able to precipitate as Al(OH)3, with a chemically active surface.  For Fe, no copper\u2013308 \nextractable pools were available.  However, since the calculations in stage 1 indicated that 309 \nFe was consistently close to saturation or oversaturated with respect to Fe(OH)3, we chose 310 \nto input the oxalate\u2013extractable pool as the \u2018active\u2019 pool, allowing it to precipitate with a 311 \nchemically active surface. For the trace metals, the pools measured by 0.22 M HNO3 were 312 \ninput.  SOM was calculated by assuming it to be 50% C and to comprise 50% humic acid 313 \nand 50% fulvic acid. Initially two sets of clay parameters were used (surface charge 314 \ndensity = 10-4 cmolc m-2, specific surface area (SSA) = 0.1 m2 kg-1 or 1.0 m2 kg-1), however 315 \npreliminary modelling showed that this did not significantly affect any predictions, 316 \ntherefore the surface area was fixed to 0.1 m2 kg-1 for all the modelling.  The supernatant 317 \npH was considered a model fitting parameter, and was adjusted by forcing charge balance.  318 \nThe results are shown in Figure 3.  In both soils #1 and #8, the best predictions of both pH 319 \nand Ca were obtained assuming the exchangeable pool only to control Ca solubility.  In 320 \nsoil #3, only small differences among the predictions were found; this is likely because the 321 \namount of input Ca derived from calcite was small compared to the exchangeable pool.  In 322 \nsoil #4, the pH was consistently and significantly overestimated in all scenarios. Even in 323 \nscenario 3, dissolved Ca was predicted as being under the control of calcite solubility, even 324 \nthough only the exchangeable pool was input.  Considering all four soils together, these 325 \n 15 \nresults suggest strongly that Ca solubility in these experiments is not controlled by 326 \nprecipitation\u2013dissolution reactions of calcite, but rather by a pool of exchangeable Ca. 327 \nModelling stage 3: solubility controls on trace metals 328 \nSolution speciation was re\u2013calculated, using the same assumptions as in Stage 1, allowing 329 \nAl(OH)3 and Fe(OH)3 to precipitate. Saturation indices were calculated for (i) metal 330 \nhydroxides Cu(OH)2, am\u2013Zn(OH)2 and b\u2013Cd(OH)2 with standard log solubility products 331 \n(Kso, 298 = aM.aOH2) of -19.83, -15.81 and -14.51 and standard enthalpies of 55.3, 31.4 and 332 \n17.2 kJ mol-1, respectively; (ii) metal carbonates CuCO3, ZnCO3 and CdCO3 with standard 333 \nlog solubility products (Kso, 298 = aM.aCO3) of -11.5, -10.00 and -12.00; (iii) the 334 \nzinc\/aluminium layered double hydroxide (LDH) Zn2Al(OH)6(CO3)0.5.xH2O, with a log 335 \nsolubility product (Kso = aZn2.aAl.aH-6.aCO30.5) of 20.8 (Johnson & Glasser 2003).  Where 336 \nenthalpy values were not available enthalpy was assumed to be zero as a first 337 \napproximation.  No saturation with respect to any of these minerals was predicted in the 338 \nexperimental solutions. 339 \nModelling stage 4: model optimisation and predictions of partitioning 340 \nIn the previous three stages we established that control of Ca and the trace metals by solid 341 \nphases appeared not to be occurring. Thus, for the final stage of modelling we assumed 342 \nthat the solubility of these elements was controlled by complexation to solid phases only.  343 \nThe results of Stage 2 did however indicate that using the measured exchangeable Ca pool 344 \ndid not always predict the supernatant pH well.  Therefore, we chose to adjust the 345 \nexchangeable Ca to fit the pH and dissolved Ca in the ambient supernatants.  Optimisation 346 \nwas done by minimising the term 347 \n  (pHobs - pHcalc)2 + (p[Ca]obs \u2013 p[Ca]calc)2, (1) 348 \nwhere the subscripts \u2018obs\u2019 and \u2018calc\u2019 refer to the observed and modelled values of pH and 349 \n 16 \np[Ca], respectively. Following optimisation, solution pH and Mg, Al, K, Ca, Cd, Cu and 350 \nZn were predicted for each supernatant in each titration.  351 \nThe optimised \u2018active\u2019 soil Ca concentration showed no clear pattern in comparison with 352 \nthe Ca extracted using NH4NO3.  The largest difference, as might be expected, was 353 \nobserved in soil #4 where the optimised pool was 44% of that measured.  In both soils #1 354 \nand #3 the optimised pool was higher at 147% and 158% of the measured pool. The least 355 \noptimisation was required for soil #8 where the optimised pool was 90% of the measured. 356 \nThe modelled pH and p[Ca] agreed reasonably well with the observations.  The pH 357 \nbuffering in soils #1, #4 and #8 was well reproduced, particularly so in soil #8 with a root 358 \nmean squared error (RMSE) of 0.02 for a mean observed pH of 5.93.  The pH buffering in 359 \nsoils #1 and soil #3 was somewhat underestimated.  Trends in p[Ca] were well reproduced, 360 \nwith soil #8 again showing the best prediction.  Trends in p[Mg] and p[K] (Figure 5) were 361 \ngenerally well reproduced, although in some cases (p[Mg] in soil #3 and p[K] in soils #3 362 \nand #4) predictions were biased.  The observed minima in aluminium solubility were 363 \nreasonably well simulated; however, the model did not reproduce higher dissolved 364 \naluminium well, showing a consistent tendency to underestimate solubility at both large 365 \nand small pH. Underestimation of p[Al] at large pH is likely related to the supersaturation 366 \nwith respect to Al(OH)3 observed in the solution speciation results, implying the presence 367 \nof colloidal Al(OH)3 in the solutions, which cannot be simulated by the model.  Including 368 \nreadily dissoluble Al solids in the active Al by using the oxalate\u2013extractable Al, improved 369 \nthe predictions of dissolved Al (dashed lines in Figure 5) with little effect on predicted 370 \np[Ca], p[Mg], p[K] or the trace metals (data not shown).  Predicted pH (dashed lines in 371 \nFigure 3) was also little affected, except for soil #1 where the pH buffering was 372 \noverestimated somewhat (RMSE in pH was 0.87, compared to 0.48 when copper 373 \nextractable Al was input). 374 \n 17 \nTrace metal solubility (Figure 6) was generally reproduced very well. Copper was 375 \nunderestimated in soils #1, #4 and #8, indicating that the 0.22 M HNO3 extraction 376 \nunderestimated the active pool.  Zinc was underestimated in soil #8 and at small pH in soil 377 \n#3. Cadmium solubility was consistently well reproduced; particularly in soils #4 and #8 378 \n(RMSEs were 0.06 and 0.11 respectively). The model consistently predicted solid phase 379 \nmetal to be predominantly bound to organic matter.  Binding to clay and iron or aluminium 380 \noxide was relatively unimportant; individual contributions to the total binding were always 381 \nbelow 5% and largely below 1%. 382 \nWhere there was clear bias between observation and prediction we optimised the active 383 \nsoil metal, to establish the difference between the measured the optimal active pools.  The 384 \ncriterion for optimisation was a mean absolute deviation of greater than 0.4 in log 385 \n(dissolved metal), thus identifying bias in the predictions as opposed to a poor trend.  The 386 \nsoils\u2013metal combinations identified were Cu in soils #1, #4 and #8 and Zn in soils #3 and 387 \n#8. Optimisation was done by adjusting the active pool of metal to exactly fit the dissolved 388 \nmetal concentration at the ambient pH.  The results are shown in Figure 6.  Since the bias 389 \nin the original predictions was consistently to lower dissolved metal concentrations, 390 \noptimised active pools were all larger than the measured ones.  The optimised pools were 391 \nbetween two and seven times greater than the 0.22 M HNO3\u2013extracted pools. In all the 392 \ncases involving copper, and in zinc in soil #3, the optimised pools were greater than the 393 \naqua regia\u2013extracted pools.  Optimising the metal pools did not produce any significant 394 \nchanges in the trends in predicted log(dissolved metal), thus where the original bias was 395 \nmost consistent, the resulting fits were a notable improvement.  This was most clearly seen 396 \nfor Cu in soils #1 and #8 where the RMSE\u2019s dropped from 0.47 and 0.60, to 0.21 and 0.15 397 \nrespectively, on optimisation. 398 \n 18 \nDiscussion 399 \nModelling the solid\u2013solution partitioning of elements in soil titrations is one of a number 400 \nof ways of assessing the abilities of speciation models to reproduce soil chemistry.  The 401 \napproach has the advantage that trends in chemistry are measured in single soils, thus 402 \nproviding quite a rigorous test of the model.  Such work also complements studies where 403 \nsingle partitioning measurements are made on a larger number of soils from a defined 404 \nregion or area (e.g. Weng et al. 2001; Tipping et al. 2003; MacDonald & Hendershot 405 \n2006). Modelling produced highly satisfactory fits to the observed data.  The model 406 \noutputs depend on a large number of input parameters, many of are derived from wet 407 \nchemical extractions that can only approximate to the conceptual pools of \u2018active\u2019 elements 408 \nand phases that the model requires as inputs.  The agreement between observations and 409 \npredictions is therefore most impressive. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first 410 \nmodelling study of soil titrations where the pH and partitioning of both the native major 411 \nions and trace metals have been studied simultaneously.  Gustafsson et al. (2003) and 412 \nGustafsson and Schaik (2003) have modelled soil pH, major ions and trace metals using 413 \nbatch titrations but added metal salts to achieve defined total concentrations, thus avoiding 414 \nthe need to estimate the active metal.  Cances et al. (2003) and Dijkstra  et al. (2004) both 415 \nperformed batch experiments without adding metals but fixed pH when modelling. In 416 \nchoosing to model the pH rather than fix it we have tested the model more rigorously than 417 \nwould otherwise have been the case. Given the importance of pH as a control on the trace 418 \nmetal partitioning it provides additional validation of the model framework as a means of 419 \nsimulating not only the control of trace metal partitioning but also the control of pH itself 420 \nby the major ions and ligands (including solid phases).  This would be important if, for 421 \nexample, we wished to model the temporal response of soil metal to variations in soil 422 \nacidification status. 423 \n 19 \nIn common with a previous study on forest soils from southern Norway (Birkenes) (Lofts 424 \net al. 2001a) we have chosen to calibrate the model individually to soils.  In contrast to this 425 \nstudy, the pool of active Ca was selected as the optimal to adjust, whereas previously the 426 \nactive pools of humic substances and Al were adjusted.  Taking the four soils together, the 427 \nmodelled soil pH was most sensitive to the value selected for the active Ca pool, which is 428 \nconsistent with the observation that on average Ca made up a larger proportion of the 429 \nactive soil cations relative to Al, than it did in the Birkenes soils.   Modelling showed that 430 \nthere was no need to invoke dissolution and precipitation of a solid Ca\u2013containing phase 431 \n(e.g. CaCO3) in these soils despite the fact that some are known to be limed; this suggests 432 \neither that the amounts of lime in the soils were not significant for Ca partitioning or that 433 \nlime dissolution was not significant on the timescale of the experiment.  The lime (\u201cOdda 434 \nlime\u201d) applied to these soils consists mainly of CaOH and CaCO3, and is believed to have 435 \nboth short\u2013 and long\u2013term effects due to its composition and particle size distribution 436 \n(pers. comm., manager at \u201cOdda lime\u201d). 437 \n 438 \nOf the major ions Al was the most poorly simulated by the model. The possible presence 439 \nof colloidal Al(OH)3 in the supernatants, as indicated by the solution modelling, could 440 \nexplain some of the model discrepancies at large pH.  However, dissolved Al at the 441 \nsmallest pH of each titration was underestimated by at least an order of magnitude, 442 \nindicating that the pool of active Al was too small.  In soils #1 and #3 this could be partly 443 \naccounted for by the overestimation of the smallest pH and the consequent underestimation 444 \nof proton competition for Al binding to the SOM.  However, this cannot explain the results 445 \nin soils #4 and #8 where the largest pH is well predicted by the model. Increasing the 446 \nactive Al pool by inputting the oxalate\u2013extractable Al consistently increased the predicted 447 \nsupernatant Al and improved the predictions considerably. This is an interesting finding, 448 \n 20 \nsince it implies that readily dissoluble Al solid phases (i.e. those extracted by oxalate but 449 \nnot by copper chloride) are part of the active Al in these soils. This contrasts with the 450 \nfindings of studies on Al solubility control in acid forest soils of the region (e.g. Berggren 451 \n& Mulder 1995; Lofts et al. 2001a) where short\u2013term solubility was controlled solely by 452 \nthe pool of organically\u2013bound Al.  The reasons for this discrepancy are not clear. From the 453 \nperspective of this study, Al is less important than Ca in controlling the chemistry of these 454 \nsoils and does not appear to be highly significant in influencing the trace metal solubility 455 \nby competition. 456 \nThe trace metal modelling results indicate that short\u2013term solubility of Cu, Zn and Cd in 457 \nthese soils is controlled by binding to organic matter.  Other binding phases, and metal 458 \nprecipitates, are indicated to have an insignificant or negligible role in controlling 459 \nsolubility.  This is in clear accordance with similar modelling studies involving these 460 \nmetals (Weng et al. 2001; Dijkstra et al. 2004). Generally the model reproduced the 461 \nobserved solubility well. Directly predicting the metal solubility as we have done here is a 462 \nmeans of assessing the extraction method for estimating the active soil metal.  Where there 463 \nwas significant bias between observations and predictions, it was readily possible to fit the 464 \nmodel by adjusting the active pool. Dilute acid extractions of the type used here are 465 \npopular for estimation of the active metal, and there is no reason to believe from the 466 \nmodelling that the measured active pools show any general bias.  A standard wet chemical 467 \nextraction for active soil metal would be useful from the point of view of modelling since it 468 \nwould improve consistency of data among studies. Wider acceptance of any single wet 469 \nchemical extraction method will, however, require application and validation against a 470 \nwider range of soil types than has currently been done.  None of the metals appeared to be 471 \ncontrolled by any of the solid phases considered. This is rather interesting in the case of the 472 \nZn\/Al LDH, since this material solid has previously been identified as comprising 20% of 473 \n 21 \nthe total Zn in a soil contaminated by smelting activities, of quite similar pH (5.6) and 474 \norganic matter content (14%) to our soils (Juillot et al. 2003).  Clearly there is a potential 475 \nfor such solids to form an appreciable portion of the Zn in contaminated soils. However, 476 \nthey appear to exert no influence on short\u2013term Zn solubility in these soils. 477 \nThe optimisation of selected metal pools to fit the observations produced some intriguing 478 \nresults.  In particular, the observation that optimised pools of Cu, in three of the soils, were 479 \ngreater than the pool obtained by aqua regia extraction, deserves attention.  Aqua regia 480 \nextraction is considered to extract some tightly bound mineral metal as well as surface 481 \nbound metals, and thus should overestimate the active pool.  This suggests that the 482 \noptimised Cu pools are unrealistically large and that the underestimation of dissolved Cu 483 \nwhen using the 0.22 M HNO3 extracted pool is due to model error.  Given the complexity 484 \nof the model, the source of such error is difficult to ascertain without fur ther work.  It is 485 \nnotable that Cu solubility depends strongly on the solubility of the soil organic matter and 486 \nthus on the relative affinity for SOM and DOM for the metal.  Predictions are therefore 487 \nexpected to be sensitive to both the intrinsic binding affinity of the model humic and fulvic 488 \nacids and to a a priori assumptions made about the activity of the SOM and DOM.  But 489 \nwithout more detailed experimental data (such as free metal ion activities in the 490 \nsupernatants) it is not appropriate to explore this further in this study. 491 \nThe mobility of DOM was clearly a significant influence on trace metal solubility in these 492 \nexperiments, particularly so for Cu and also to a lesser extent for Zn and Cd at largest pH.  493 \nThis is again in clear accordance with current knowledge about the binding of these metals 494 \nto organic matter.  It ought to be realised that the concentrations of DOM encountered in 495 \nthe batch titration supernatants are likely to be higher than those encountered in field soil 496 \nsolutions or local surface waters; this is an increasingly recognised phenomenon in soil 497 \nexperimentation in the laboratory (e.g. (Tipping et al. 2003).  The supernatant metal 498 \n 22 \nconcentrations cannot therefore be taken as representative of the concentrations that we 499 \nwould expect to encounter in field samples.  The data are better viewed as providing a test 500 \nof the mechanistic underpinning of the model and of its ability to describe how the 501 \nsupernatant chemistry varies as a result of experimental manipulation. 502 \nAs noted in the Introduction, the use of Kds to quantify metal partitioning remains common 503 \nsince many transport and fate models require the Kd as an input parameter, but there are 504 \nsignificant difficulties inherent in measuring Kds that are suitably representative of field 505 \nconditions.  Coupled speciation\u2013transport models (e.g. (Tipping et al. 2006), incorporating 506 \nother longer term metal input and loss processes such as mineral weathering,  provide an 507 \nalternative approach to simulating the transport and fate of metals in the soil environment.  508 \nIt is clear from the results of this and previous studies that speciation models have great 509 \npotential in simulating trace metal partitioning in soils. The further work needed to 510 \nestablish relationships between analytical measurements and model inputs would be best 511 \nachieved by analysing and modelling as wide a range of soils as possible. A criticism 512 \nsometimes made of speciation modelling is the richness of input data required, compared 513 \nfor example to a single Kd value.  While this is certainly the case, it is also true that 514 \nspeciation model outputs are richer in that they provide a framework to describe metal 515 \npartitioning in the context of other changes in soil chemistry (e.g. pH and DOM 516 \nconcentration). A goal of terrestrial metal modelling should be to link the partitioning and 517 \nfate of contaminant metals to major soil processes such as acidity buffering and carbon 518 \ncycling.  Only by doing this can we begin to assess the effects of large scale environmental 519 \nchange on trace metals in soils. 520 \nAcknowledgements 521 \nWe want to thank Dr. Oddvar R\u00f8yseth at the Norwegian Institute for Water 522 \nResearch, Oslo, for assistance with ICP-MS analysis and fruitful discussions.
