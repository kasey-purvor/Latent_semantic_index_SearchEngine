INTRODUCTION\nThe transformation of signals in a noisy environment by\nnonlinear systems through which they pass has attracted\nmuch attention over many years. Several nontrivial and at\nfirst sight surprising phenomena have been observed and\nstudied. One example is the phenomenon of stochastic reso-\nnance \u0001SR\u0002 \u00031\u0004, which is of great interest and importance\n\u00032\u20134\u0004. SR is a cooperative nonlinear effect that is observed in\na wide range of nonlinear systems simultaneously driven by\nnoise and a weak signal. The output signal-to-noise ratio, or\nother measure of coherence, can be optimized for a particular\nnoise level, so that it possesses a bell-shaped curve when\nplotted as a function of noise intensity. Depending on the\namplitude of the signal one can distinguish linear and non-\nlinear regimes of system response. Theoretical studies and\nanalog simulations of SR have shown that, for a weak signal,\nthe phenomenon can be correctly described within the frame-\nwork of linear response theory \u00035\u0004. In this regime the system\nresponse does not depend on signal parameters, for example,\non spectral structure, but it does depend on system nonlin-\nearity and noise. The opposite case is a nonlinear regime,\nwhen the amplitude of the signal is strong enough. A variety\nof nonlinear effects can then be observed. The generation of\nhigher harmonics and spectral holes has been investigated in\ndetail \u00036\u20138\u0004. The influence of the signal\u2019s spectral structure\non the signal-to-noise enhancement was discussed in \u00039\u0004.\nWithin the nonlinear regime, synchronization of the stochas-\ntic switching dynamics by the periodic force becomes ame-\nnable to direct observation. In \u000310\u0004 it was shown that the\nmean switching frequency \u0001MSF\u0002 of a noisy bistable system\ncan be locked over a finite range of noise intensities, so that\na region of synchronization very similar to an Arnold\u2019s\ntongue can be plotted in the parameter plane noise intensity\nvs signal amplitude. Inside this synchronization region the\nMSF appears to be locked by the periodic signal. In \u000311\u0004 a\nfurther generalization was made: it has been shown that the\nsynchronization of switching can also be realized for a ran-\ndom spike train, i.e., the effect is relevant for information-\ncarrying signals. An experimental study of the effect in a\nbiological system was reported in \u000312\u0004; the phenomenon is\nimportant for the understanding of signal processing in a\nneuronal system, since it specifies the conditions under\nwhich noise induces a regime of complete \u0001optimal\u0002 informa-\ntion transmission and simultaneously it is observed in a wide\nrange of noise amplitudes.\nThe effects described above were observed for signals\nwith a single dominant time scale \u000327\u0004. In real systems, how-\never, it is often the case that there may be several superim-\nposed signals with different time scales. Such superposition\ncan result from the mixing of a signal with jamming inter-\nference in a radio transmission, or in the activity of two\ndistinct areas of a neural network. In the case of a weak\nsignal, the presence of additional components does not\nchange the transformation of each individual component.\nHowever, for a larger signal, interactions between its com-\nponents and the system nonlinearity will play a role. Indeed,\na number of phenomena have been observed in the specific\ncase of two-component signals, e.g., an experimental realiza-\ntion of noise-enhanced heterodyning in a bistable optical sys-\ntem \u000313\u0004. Another interesting effect is the so-called ghost\nresonance \u000314\u0004 observed in bistable systems forced by noise\nand a signal that consists of two close harmonic components.\nIn the latter case, system nonlinearity produces the SR effect\nfor a beat frequency. The possible relevance of ghost reso-\nnance for signal processing in auditory systems has been\nwidely discussed \u000314,15\u0004. In \u000316\u0004 the noise was replaced by a\nhigh-frequency harmonic excitation with a much higher fre-\nquency than the signal. An SR-like behavior of the spectral\ngain factor was observed, an effect that was named vibra-\ntional resonance, and a maximum of the gain factor is ob-\nserved by transition from sub- to suprathreshold excitation.\nThe presence of noise induces gain degradation in vibra-\ntional resonance \u000317\u201319\u0004.\nIn the present paper we investigate switching synchroni-\nzation of a noisy bistable system due to a biperiodic signal\nconsisting of low and high frequency components. Thus we\nintroduce two different time scales into the signal. There are\nseveral motivations for the study. First, as it is well known,\nclassical SR is a low-frequency phenomenon, i.e., it is at its\nmost pronounced for low frequency signals. The questions\nthat arise here are whether an additional high frequency bias\ncan control synchronization at the low frequency or, con-\nversely, how the low frequency bias changes the system re-\nsponse to the high frequency component. Another motivation\n*i.khovanov@lancaster.ac.uk\n\u2020p.v.e.mcclintock@lancaster.ac.uk\nPHYSICAL REVIEW E 76, 031122 \u00012007\u0002\n1539-3755\/2007\/76\u00013\u0002\/031122\u00016\u0002 \u00a92007 The American Physical Society031122-1\nrelates to possible applications of SR for the transmission\nand enhancement of information-carrying signals. The sim-\nplest model of such a signal is a superposition of harmonic\nsignals with different amplitudes and frequencies. We con-\nsider the case of two harmonic components with frequencies\nthat differ by a factor of ten. To investigate the problem, we\nchoose a simple bistable system in the form of an electrical\ncircuit \u0001the Schmitt trigger\u0002. The paper is organized as fol-\nlows. In Sec. II we introduce the model and specify the ex-\nperimental setup. The measures that we apply to quantify the\nsynchronization phenomena are discussed in Sec. III. The\nresults of the measurements are discussed theoretically in\nSec. IV and the conclusions drawn are summarized in Sec. V.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL ARRANGEMENTS\nTo analyze the switching process we chose an archetypal\nsystem demonstrating pure two-state dynamics: the Schmitt\ntrigger, for which a schematic circuit and its hysteresis char-\nacteristics are presented in Fig. 1. An ideal Schmitt trigger\ncircuit driven by external force F\u0001t\u0002 obeys the equation\nUout = sgn\u0003\u0002U \u2212 F\u0001t\u0002\u0004 , \u00011\u0002\nwhere \u201csgn\u201d is the sign function and the threshold values \u0002U\nare defined by resistors R1 and R2:\n\u0002U =\nR1\nR1 + R2\nUout, \u00012\u0002\nwhere the output voltage Uout= \u00b1U0 is equal to either the\npositive or negative voltage \u00b1U0 of the power source. The\nvalue of the output voltage is controlled by external force\nF\u0001t\u0002, i.e., if F\u0001t\u0002\u0003 \u0005\u0002U\u0005 the trigger is in its upper state +U0, if\nF\u0001t\u0002\u0004\u2212\u0005\u0002U\u0005, then it is in the state \u2212U0. Equation \u00011\u0002 de-\nscribes the circuit correctly provided that the relaxation rate\nof the trigger is the fastest scale and that it is much shorter\nthan either the signal time scale or the correlation time of the\nnoise.\nA Gaussian noise generator, used as a noise source \u0005\u0001t\u0002,\nproduces colored noise with a Lorentzian spectrum, charac-\nterized by a cutoff frequency of 100 kHz. The noise under-\ngoes additional filtering by a circuit element \u0001mixer\u0002, so that\nthe tail of the spectrum at the trigger input differs from the\nLorentzian. The noise energy is characterized by its root-\nmean-square amplitude \u0006 as measured by an rms voltmeter.\nTwo independent harmonic signal generators are used to pro-\nvide the two-frequency force. The circuit response is digi-\ntized by an analog-to-digital converter \u0001ADC\u0002 and passed to\na computer for analysis. The ADC was a DAS-1600 with a\nmaximum sampling rate of 105 points per second in the re-\ngime of input buffering. The relaxation rate of the trigger\nwas 1 MHz.\nFrom such a two-frequency signal Fs\u0001t\u0002 one can single out\nits low-frequency \u0001LF\u0002 and high-frequency \u0001HF\u0002 components\nas\nFs\u0001t\u0002 = AL sin\u00012\u0007fLt\u0002 + AH sin\u00012\u0007fHt\u0002 , \u00013\u0002\nwhere fL and fH are the frequencies, and AL and AH are the\namplitudes, of the LF and HF parts, respectively. It is intu-\nitively evident that the two time scales in such a regular force\nmust lead to a mutual influence of each component on the\nother. Let us fix the threshold level \u0005\u0002U \u0005 =\u0002*=470 mV and\nconsider the response of the Schmitt trigger forced by the\ntwo-frequency signal Fs\u0001t\u0002 and colored noise \u0005\u0001t\u0002:\nUout = sgn\u0003\u0002U \u2212 Fs\u0001t\u0002 \u2212 \u0005\u0001t\u0002\u0004 . \u00014\u0002\nFor convenience of representation of the results, the ampli-\ntudes of the regular signal AL and AH, as well as noise am-\nplitude \u0006, are normalized by the value of the same threshold\nlevel \u0002*. For the theoretical discussion, all values of frequen-\ncies used in experiments were normalized by 1 kHz.\nIn our experiments the regular signal is subthreshold, AL\n+AH\u0004\u0002U, and all the switchings between states are there-\nfore induced by noise. So the experiment differs from the\narrangement used for vibrational resonance and corresponds\nto the usual conditions used for SR and MSF locking studies.\nWe set the signal frequencies arbitrarily at fL=100 Hz and\nfH=1006 Hz and analyze the influence of each component of\nthe composite two-frequency \u0001biharmonic\u0002 signal on stochas-\ntic synchronization. Note that although the ratio between the\nselected frequencies fL and fH is rational, and that the signal\nis consequently periodic, this fact is not important in itself\nhere since the period of signal is much larger than the peri-\nods of both the LF component and the measurement time.\nMoreover, if we choose a signal period equal to one period\nof the LF component, e.g., fH=nfL \u0001n\b10 is integer\u0002, all the\neffects to be discussed below will be observed and additional\nfine structure will appear in the phase distribution. In other\nwords, since the frequencies fL and fH differ by one order of\nmagnitude, the observed effects do not depend on whether\nthe ratio between the frequencies is rational or irrational.\nIII. STOCHASTIC SYNCHRONIZATION\nThe effect of MSF locking by an external harmonic signal\nwas reported in \u000310\u0004 and it was shown that this phenomenon\n(a)\n(b)\nFIG. 1.

MCCLINTOCK PHYSICAL REVIEW E 76, 031122 \u00012007\u0002\n031122-2\ncan be considered as an example of stochastic synchroniza-\ntion \u000311,12,20,21\u0004. In contrast with synchronization in deter-\nministic systems, stochastic synchronization considers inter-\naction between a number of processes one or several of\nwhich is or are random. For example, when the MSF is\nlocked, the harmonic signal controls the stochastic switch-\nings of the bistable system and, within a certain interval of\nnoise intensities, the MSF coincides with the frequency of\nthe periodic signal. For a symmetrical bistable system, the\nlocking of the MSF is defined by the probability that a ran-\ndom process crosses a boundary \u0001barrier\u0002 between the states\nfor a specific range of signal phase. In the presence of a\nharmonic signal this boundary is periodically nonstationary\nand stochastic synchronization is observed under the condi-\ntion that the first passage time to the boundary +\u0005\u0002U \u0005\n+A sin \t for \t\u0001 \u0001\u0007 ,2\u0007\u0002 tends to infinity, whereas the pas-\nsage to the boundary +\u0005\u0002U \u0005 +A sin \t for \t\u0001 \u00010,\u0007\u0002 occurs\nduring a finite time that is less than half the period of the\nsignal. That is, the phase intervals in which a switching does\nor does not occur are strongly emphasized. The switching for\nthe values of signal phase \t\u0001 \u00010,\u0007\u0002 for which the probabil-\nity of transition to a state is larger than the probability tran-\nsition to another state can be determined as in-phase switch-\ning. Otherwise, one can speak of out-of-phase switching.\nNote that, in contrast to the classical usage of the terms \u201cin-\nphase\u201d and \u201cout-of-phase,\u201d a phase interval is meant here.\nWithin the approximation that the switching probability is\nequal to unity for switching in-phase, and to zero for switch-\ning out-of-phase, the situation corresponds to stochastic syn-\nchronization. Thus the effect of MSF locking can be consid-\nered as the phenomenon of phase and frequency stochastic\nsynchronization.\nThe conditions of MSF locking formulated above are of\ncourse subject in practice to finite observation time. If an\nideal source of Gaussian noise is applied, satisfaction of the\nstrict condition that the switching probability is equal to zero\n\u0001in a theoretical limit of infinite observation time\u0002 at a given\nphase is impossible because of the nonvanishing tail of the\nnoise distribution. But, since the tail is exponential, and the\nobservation time is in reality finite, satisfaction of the syn-\nchronization condition depends on the parameters of system\nand forcing. In practice, one can compare the switching\nprobability with a small constant value instead of with zero.\nThe switching process in a bistable system can be charac-\nterized by the MSF and the evolution of the residence time\ndistribution p\u0001\n\u0002 and phase \u0001or cycle\u0002 distribution p\u0001\t\u0002 \u000322\u0004.\nThe phase distribution p\u0001\t\u0002 estimates the probability of\nswitching at the given phase \t of the harmonic signal. In the\ncase considered one can separately introduce the phase dis-\ntributions for the LF p\u0001\tL\u0002 and HF p\u0001\tH\u0002 harmonic compo-\nnents. The residence time p\u0001\n\u0002 is the time interval \n between\ntwo successive switchings. The MSF \u0006f\u0007 is defined by the\nresidence time distribution as follows:\n\u0006f\u0007 = \b lim\nt\u0001\u2192\u000b\n2\nt\u0001\n\t\n0\nt\u0001\n\np\u0001\n\u0002d\n\n\u22121. \u00015\u0002\nIn the experiments, a thousand switching events were col-\nlected to evaluate the MSF and the corresponding distribu-\ntion for each set of parameters. The trigger output signal and\nthe signal from the lower-frequency harmonic generator\nwere simultaneously recorded to determine the switching\nphase. The moments of switching and values of the switch-\ning phase were calculated using a linear interpolation of\npoints in the time series.\nIV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND THEORETICAL\nCONSIDERATIONS\nFirst, the evolution of the system response was measured\nas the amplitude of the HF component was increased, keep-\ning the amplitude of the LF component fixed at AL=0.2.\nFigure 2\u0001a\u0002 plots the mean switching frequency as a function\nof the input noise amplitude \u0006 for different values of the HF\namplitude AH. In the absence of the HF part of the signal, the\nMSF increases monotonically \u0001dashed line\u0002 in the range of\nlow frequency fL. As the amplitude of the HF component\nincreases, switchings occur for smaller values of noise am-\nplitude, and flat regions corresponding to synchronization\ncan be observed. The latter expand with increasing strength\nof the HF component. Thus the regime of MSF locking at\nlow frequency has been realized by application of the higher\nfrequency external excitation.

Note that the curve 1 is the same\nfor both figures \u0001a\u0002 and \u0001b\u0002, but it is shown for different\nordinate scales. As it is seen, the increase in amplitude of the\nHF component is qualitatively equivalent to a decrease in the\nthreshold value: the curves shift to the direction of smaller\nnoise amplitude and the synchronization regime is observed.\nBelow we provide additional support of this equivalence.\nFor AH=0.7 \u0003curve 4 in Fig. 2\u0001a\u0002\u0004, the MSF is constant in\ntwo regions of noise amplitude. In the first one, the MSF\ncoincides with the low frequency fL and, in the second one,\nwith the high frequency fH. Let us consider this situation.\nWithout LF bias, the locking of the MSF at fH has been\nrealized \u0003dashed curve in Fig. 2\u0001a\u0002\u0004. In the presence of the LF\ncomponent with A=0.2 a region of synchronization at fre-\nquency fL arises and the synchronization area for frequency\nfH decreases. Thus the locking of the mean switching fre-\nquency is realized at both frequencies fL and fH.\nTo understand how the HF component influences the re-\nsponse of the trigger to the LF component, we can average\nover the fast time scale TH=1\/ fH.

The agreement between experiment and theory\ncan be considered satisfactory.\nThe experimental results also show clearly that, in turn,\nLF bias influences synchronization at fH. Without the LF\ncomponent there is a wide region of MSF locking on fH\n\u0003dashed line in Fig. 2\u0001a\u0002\u0004; the LF component induces a sig-\nnificant decrease of the region \u0001curve 4\u0002. The presence of LF\npart can be considered to produce a slow trend in the signal.\nIn this case the synchronization conditions for the HF\ncomponent should be modified by replacing \u0002U with\n\u0002U\u2212AL cos\u00012\u0007fLt\u0002. The periodic change of the threshold\ncan be approximated by a step function \u0002U\u22122AL \/\n\u0007 sgn\u0003cos\u00012\u0007fLt\u0002\u0004, i.e., for one half period the threshold is\n\u0002U\u22122AL \/\u0007 and for the other half it is \u0002U+2AL \/\u0007. Then we\ncan calculate two MSFs \u000110\u0002 for the two threshold values\nseparately, and estimate the resultant MSF as the mean of\nthese two. This approach is valid for \u0006f\u0007\r fL. The curve to\nwhich it leads fitted the experimental results quite well \u0003Fig.\n3\u0001b\u0002\u0004. Thus the presence of a slow trend leads to a degrada-\ntion of stochastic synchronization.\nWe now consider the distributions of residence times p\u0001\n\u0002\nand phases p\u0001\t\u0002 in the synchronization regime with both\ncomponents of the forcing frequency Fs\u0001t\u0002. For this purpose\nwe plot distributions p\u0001\n\u0002 and p\u0001\t\u0002 before, at the moment of,\nand after synchronization at frequencies fL and fH \u0001Figs. 4\nand 5\u0002. The solid \u0001blue\u0002 line corresponds to the HF compo-\nnent and the dashed \u0001red\u0002 line to the LF component in the\nplots of p\u0001\t\u0002. The dependences of the amplitude of a har-\nmonic signal on phase are shown by the dotted lines.\nIf the mean switching frequency is smaller than the low\nfrequency fL, the distribution p\u0001\n\u0002 consists of two sharply\npronounced time scales. One scale is defined by the period\nTL of the LF component, the other is defined by TH. As\nshown in Fig. 4\u0001a\u0002 the structure of exponentially decreasing\npeaks centered at TL \/2+nTL \u0001n=1,2 . . . \u0002 is modulated by the\nfrequency fH. The distribution p\u0001\t\u0002 shows that the switch-\nings are in-phase for both components, and the phases of the\nLF and HF components lie within the interval from 0 to \u0007. In\nthe region of synchronization at fL a plot of the residence\ntime distribution demonstrates several peaks \u0003Fig. 4\u0001b\u0002\u0004, their\nenvelope corresponding to the synchronization by a har-\nmonic signal. For both components, the switchings are in-\nphase and, for the LF component, the region of possible\nswitching phase is wider than for the HF part.\nThe distributions p\u0001\n\u0002 and p\u0001\t\u0002 after the breakdown of\nsynchronization at frequency fL are shown in Fig. 4\u0001c\u0002. Out-\nof-phase switchings for the LF component appear but, for the\nHF component, the distribution p\u0001\t\u0002 has nonzero values only\nin a narrow region of phase located in the interval \t\n\u0001 \u00030,\u0007\u0004. The peaks in p\u0001\n\u0002 corresponding to the out-of-\nphase switchings with respect to the LF component are de-\nfined by the period of the HF part.\nIf the MSF is larger than the low frequency fL, but smaller\nthan fH, then the influence of the LF component is not seen\nin either of the distributions p\u0001\n\u0002 and p\u0001\t\u0002 \u0003Fig. 5\u0001a\u0002\u0004. The\npeak locations in the distribution of residence times are de-\nfined by the HF component alone: switchings occur in-phase\nbut the switching probability for any value of the low-\nfrequency phase is nonzero.\nFigure 5\u0001b\u0002 shows the plots of distributions for the regime\nof synchronization at fH. The switchings occur every half\nperiod of the HF component. The phase distribution for the\nLF part is flat.\nWhen out-of-phase switchings with respect to the HF\ncomponent appear, the synchronization at frequency fH\nbreaks down and a new short-time peak appears in the resi-\ndence time distribution \u0003Fig. 5\u0001c\u0002\u0004. For the HF component\nthe distribution p\u0001\t\u0002 includes phase intervals with zero\nswitching probability and two peaks, the distance between\nthem being equal to \u0007.

Obviously, the\nmagnitude of the average phase coincides with the phase for\nwhich the switching probability is maximal. At the moment\nof switching, the average phase is close to \u0007 \/2 and, with\nincrease of the noise amplitude, the value of the average\nphase approaches zero. Consequently, the switching moment\nis defined not only by the value of signal amplitude but also\nby the sign of the derivative of the regular signal.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nIn summary, our investigation of stochastic synchroniza-\ntion in a bistable system forced by a biharmonic signal al-\nlows us to conclude that the phenomenon of synchronization\ndepends on relationships between the parameters of the sig-\nnal\u2019s components. Synchronization at the low frequency was\nrealized and enhanced by introduction of the higher fre-\nquency excitation. Correspondingly, the region of MSF lock-\ning at the low frequency depends on the amplitude of the HF\nbias. Locking of the MSF by both components of the regular\nforce can be realized, the locking of MSF by the LF compo-\nnent being induced by the high-frequency excitation. The\neffect of synchronization is defined by the time scales of both\ncomponents. On the other hand, for MSF locking by the HF\ncomponent, the presence of a slow trend \u0001the LF component\u0002\nleads to a degradation of stochastic synchronization. These\nresults are important not only for physics but perhaps also\nfor biology as a possible mechanism of information trans-\nmission by sensory neurons.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors thank A.
