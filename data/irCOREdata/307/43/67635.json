The distributions of\nprecipitating electrons and derived quantities such as total\nelectron energy flux during magnetic storms depend on\nvariations of the source distributions (i.e., magnetotail\nelectron fluxes), electron drift, and electron pitch-angle\nscattering. In this work we simulate the bounce-averaged\ndrifts and postulate the loss rates of plasma sheet electrons\nso as to model the storm time electron diffuse aurora. In our\npast work [Schulz and Chen, 1999; Chen and Schulz,\n2001a, 2001b] we have followed the drift paths of plasma\nsheet electrons in a simplified convection electric field\nmodel that included corotation, a time-independent shielded\n[Volland, 1973, 1975; Stern, 1974, 1975] term, and a\nvariable unshielded [Nishida, 1966; Brice, 1967] term.\nHowever, CRRES and DMSP satellite measurements\n[Wygant et al., 1998; Rowland and Wygant, 1998; Anderson\net al., 2001], along with Millstone Hill radar measurements\n[Yeh et al., 1991], show that storm time magnetospheric\nelectric fields are significantly more complicated in spatial\nstructure than the above-mentioned models. In the present\nstudy, we use the Assimilative Model of Ionospheric Elec-\ntrodynamics (AMIE) [Richmond and Kamide, 1988], which\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 110, A03210, doi:10.1029\/2004JA010725, 2005\n1Space Sciences Applications Laboratory, The Aerospace Corporation,\nEl Segundo, California, USA.\n2Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Center, Palo Alto, California,\nUSA.\n3Now at University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, Texas, USA.\n4High Altitude Observatory, Boulder, Colorado, USA.\n5University of Alabama, Huntsville, Alabama, USA.\n6Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio, Texas, USA.\n7Now at Inficon AG, Balzers, Principality of Liechtenstein.\nCopyright 2005 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/05\/2004JA010725$09.00\nA03210 1 of 19\nfeatures large storm time electric fields in localized regions\nof MLT at L \u0001 2.5\u20135 in the inner magnetosphere. This\nmodel allows us to investigate the plasma sheet electron\ntransport more realistically than do the simplified models\nwe have used previously. In this work we consider two\nelectron pitch-angle scattering-rate models: (1) strong pitch-\nangle diffusion, and (2) a diffusion rate that is less than\neverywhere strong but dependent on magnetic local time\n(MLT). Model 1 is a limiting idealization that is useful for\ncomparison with more realistic scattering models.\n[3] We apply our scattering without clearly identifying\nthe scattering mechanism that causes diffuse auroral elec-\ntrons to precipitate. Two main mechanisms for this have\nbeen proposed.\n[4] Early on, it was believed that electrostatic cyclotron\nharmonic (ECH) waves (also known as \u2018\u2018n + 1\/2\u2019\u2019 waves)\ngenerated by a loss cone instability would scatter plasma\nsheet electrons sufficiently to account for the diffuse aurora\n[Kennel et al., 1970; Kennel and Ashour-Abdalla, 1982;\nAshour-Abdalla and Kennel, 1978]. Early measurements of\nECH waves seemed to show sufficient power to scatter 1\u2013\n20 keV electrons into the auroral loss cone at the required\nrate [Scarf et al., 1973] if assumed to extend along entire\nfield lines of interest. However, later wave observations at\ngeosynchronous orbit [Belmont et al., 1983], at 4\u201312 RE\n[Roeder and Koons, 1989], and at 5\u20138 RE [Koons and\nRoeder, 1990] have shown that ECH waves are localized\nnear the equator and do not have enough power to scatter\n1\u201320 keV electrons strongly (i.e., so as to cause pitch-angle\nisotropy). Horne and Thorne [2000] calculated bounce-\naveraged pitch-angle diffusion rates for ECH waves and\nsimilarly concluded that ECH waves do not have enough\npower to scatter 1\u201320 keV electrons strongly. At the time,\nthe lack of sufficient ECH power to generate strong diffu-\nsion seemed to refute pitch-angle scattering by ECH waves\nas a viable mechanism for producing the diffuse aurora.\nHowever, our recent simulations [Chen and Schulz, 2001b]\nhave shown that if strong diffusion occurred over a sub-\nstantial portion of the plasma sheet electron\u2019s drift path, then\nmost of the electrons in a flux tube would precipitate before\nreaching dawn, leaving too few electrons to account for the\nbrightness of the diffuse aurora observed there. Thus there is\nnot necessarily a requirement for strong diffusion by waves\nto account for the diffuse aurora.\n[5] The other wave mode widely invoked for scattering\ndiffuse auroral electrons is the whistler mode [e.g., Cornil-\nleau-Wehrlin et al., 1985; Johnstone et al., 1993; Villalo\u00b4n\nand Burke, 1995; Johnstone, 1996]. Johnstone et al. [1993]\nattributed certain features in the CRRES electron data to\nwhistler-mode interactions and argued in particular that\nsignificant low-energy electron precipitation at high lati-\ntudes can be accounted for by such interactions. From the\nshape of electron pitch-angle distributions observed by\nCRRES, Meredith et al. [1999] recently inferred that both\nwhistler-mode (at L ^ 6) and ECH waves (L ] 6) play\nsignificant roles in scattering plasma sheet electrons. More\nrecently, Horne et al. [2003] have analyzed whistler mode\nhiss, chorus, and ECH waves, together with electron pitch-\nangle distributions measured by CRRES during a small\nsubstorm injection. They thereby found that ECH waves\nprobably provided the major contribution to diffuse auroral\nprecipitation for the event studied.\n[6] This study focuses on comparing simulations and\nobservations of diffuse auroral precipitation for a particular\nmagnetic storm. While we do not specifically identify the\nelectron scattering mechanisms here, through comparisons\nof modeled and measured distributions of precipitating\nelectrons we do gain a better understanding of the global\ntransport and scattering of the plasma sheet electrons\nnecessary to produce the observed storm time diffuse\naurora. We have chosen the 19 October 1998 storm (min-\nimum Dst = \u0002112 nT), partly because this storm has been\nselected for detailed study by the NSF Geospace Environ-\nment Modeling (GEM) Inner Magnetosphere Storms Cam-\npaign. Moreover, Anderson et al. [2000a, 2000b] analyzed\nPolar\/Polar Ionospheric X-ray Imaging Experiment (PIXIE)\nand Polar\/Ultraviolet Imager (UVI) images in detail for this\nstorm. We will also compare our simulated patterns of\nprecipitating electron energy flux with Dst-binned NOAA-\n12 electron data, averaged over a 10-year interval [Wu\u00a8est et\nal., 2005].\n2. Simulation Method\n[7] We model the magnetospheric B field as the super-\nposition of a dipolar magnetic field and a uniform south-\nward DB parallel to the dipole axis [Dungey, 1963]. For this\nstudy we have kept DB constant and have chosen\nDB(=14.7 nT) in time so that the circular boundary between\nclosed and open field lines intersects the Earth at a constant\ncolatitude q* = 20\u0002, and thus the radius of the neutral line is\nconstant during the storm. This leads to a circular neutral line\nof radius b = 12.82 RE in the equatorial plane. This simple\nfield model preserves essential features of the relevant\nphysical processes, while still letting us represent the results\nof needed subsidiary calculations in terms of analytic func-\ntions. The equation of a field line in this model is\nr \u00bc La 1\u00fe 1=2\u00f0 \u00de r=b\u00f0 \u00de3\nh i\nsin2 q; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere r is the geocentric distance, q is the magnetic\ncolatitude, a is the Earth\u2019s radius, and L is the dimensionless\nmagnetic-shell label inversely proportional to the amount of\nmagnetic flux enclosed. The label L* = 2b\/3a of the last\nclosed field line is L* = 8.5466 for q* = 20\u0002. In future\nstudies we plan to use a time-varying DB so that the size of\nour model magnetosphere varies more realistically during\nthe course of a storm. Such a magnetic field would lead to\ninduced electric fields that we do not consider in the present\nstudy.\n2.1. Kinematics\n[8] To simplify the kinematics underlying this study, we\ntreat the drift of plasma sheet electrons of interest as if they\nwere in strong pitch-angle diffusion. Under strong pitch-\nangle diffusion the pitch-angle distributions would be es-\nsentially isotropic at each electron energy of interest. In the\nlimit of strong scattering, all electrons of a given energy in a\ngiven magnetic flux tube would drift together as one under\nthe influence of gradient-B, curvature, and electric forces.\nThe phase-space volume\nL \u0007 p3Y \u0007 p3\nI\nds=B\u00f0 \u00de; \u00f02\u00de\nA03210 CHEN ET AL.: STORM TIME DIFFUSE AURORAL SIMULATIONS\n2 of 19\nA03210\ndefined by the product of the momentum-space volume that\nthe electrons surround (4pp3\/3) and the flux-tube volume Y\nthat they occupy, is adiabatically invariant in the limit\nof strong pitch-angle diffusion, even as the usual first\nand second invariants M and J are strongly violated. It can\nbe shown [Rosenbluth and Longmire, 1957; Southwood,\n1977] that conservation of L is analogous to the adiabatic\ngas law. With conservation of L it is implicitly assumed that\nthere is no energy diffusion due to wave-particle interac-\ntions. An adiabatically invariant quantity proportionally to\nL2\/3 for nonrelativistic particles is held constant in the Rice\nConvection Model (RCM) [Harel et al., 1981; Wolf et al.,\n1982].\n[9] Observed particle distributions in the plasma sheet are\nindeed approximately isotropic by some accounts [e.g.,\nStiles et al., 1978], but we have found [Chen and Schulz,\n2001a, 2001b] that truly strong pitch-angle diffusion would\ncause a diffuse aurora that is more intense than typically\nobserved. In the present study we nevertheless treat particles\nas if they were in strong pitch angle diffusion so as to\nsimplify our drift calculations, but we employ models with\nappropriately reduced scattering rates to describe the result-\ning electron precipitation and loss. We believe this is a\nreasonable compromise for now. However, we plan to\nimprove upon this treatment of drifts in future work by\nusing eigenmodes of the pitch-angle diffusion operator\n[Roberts, 1969; Schulz, 1991, pp. 229\u2013231] as quasi-\nparticles to achieve a smooth transition from isotropy in\nthe plasma sheet to progressively greater anisotropy at lower\nL values.\n[10] In Dungey\u2019s model magnetosphere the flux-tube\nvolume Y is very well approximated [Schulz, 1998] by an\nanalytical expression that depends on L. Thus the Hamilto-\nnian function can be expressed analytically in terms of L.\nAdiabatic drift shells are surfaces of constant L and H if the\nHamiltonian function\nH L;f; t\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc L=Y\u00f0 \u00de2=3c2 \u00fe m20c4\nh i1=2\n\u0002 m0c2 \u00fe q \u0002 VW=L\u00f0 \u00de\u00bd\n\u00fe FE L;f; t\u00f0 \u00de\t \u00f03\u00de\nis either time-independent or regarded as being \u2018\u2018frozen in\ntime\u2019\u2019 [e.g., Chen et al., 2003]. Here q is the particle charge,\nj is magnetic local time, \u0002VW\/L is the corotation potential\n(VW = 90 kV), and FE is the electrostatic potential function.\nWe have used (2) to express the momentum in terms of L\nand the flux tube volume.\n2.2. Dynamics\n[11] In this study we use AMIE, the Assimilative Model\nof Ionospheric Electrodynamics [Richmond and Kamide,\n1988], to prescribe the electric potentials in our simulation\nmodel. Although commonly displayed as plots, AMIE\npotentials are in fact based on an analytical expansion in\nterms of colatitude q and magnetic local time j in the\nionosphere so that\nFAMIE q;f; t\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc\nX\ni\nai t\u00f0 \u00deFi q;f\u00f0 \u00de; \u00f04\u00de\nwhere the ai are AMIE expansion coefficients and t denotes\ntime. The scalar basis functions Fi are constructed from\nassociated Legendre functions with nonintegral degree n at\nlatitudes 40\u0002 and 50\u0002 and from trignometric functions at\nlower latitudes [Richmond and Kamide, 1988]:\nFi q;f\u00f0 \u00de\n\u00bc K1i P mj jn cos q\u00f0 \u00de fm f\u00f0 \u00de q < q0; q > p\u0002 q0 \u00f05a\u00de\n\u00bc K2i cotm q=2\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe tanm q=2\u00f0 \u00de\u00bd \t fm f\u00f0 \u00de q0 < q < p\u0002 q0\n\u00f05b\u00de\nwith\nfm f\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc\nffiffiffi\n2\np\ncosmf m < 0\n\u00bc 1 m \u00bc 0\n\u00bc ffiffiffi2p sinmf m > 0:\n\u00f06\u00de\nwhere i = (n, m), q0 is the colatitude (typically chosen to be\n40\u0002) at which (5a) and (5b) are forced to match smoothly; m\nis the azimuthal \u2018\u2018wave\u2019\u2019 number; while K1i and K2i are\nnormalizing constants chosen so that the vector basis\nfunctions rFi are orthonormal over the ionosphere and\ncontinuous at q = q0. The eigenvalues n are determined by\nmatching logarithmic derivatives @lnFi(q, j)\/@q, as speci-\nfied by (5a) and (5b) at q = q0. AMIE potentials are not\nusually calculated equatorward of q = q0 in practice. The\nAMIE coefficients ai are determined via least-squares fit of\nthe analytical expansion (4) to magnetometer data and to\nany available satellite and radar data. AMIE potentials can\nbe mapped analytically to anywhere in the magnetic field\nmodel that we use via (1), the equation of the field-line\nlabel. According to (1), the relationship between L and q at\nthe usual altitude r \u0002 a = 110 km of the AMIE model is\nL \u00bc 1:017= sin2 q: \u00f07\u00de\nThis relationship allows AMIE potentials to be expressed as\nFAMIE(L, j, t), a function of L, j, and t. More complicated\nmagnetic field models would require a numerical mapping\nof AMIE potentials [cf. Boonsiriseth et al., 2001]. Further\ndetails on the mapping of the AMIE electric field to our\nfield model are included in the work of Chen et al. [2003].\n[12] For this study we have chosen to simulate the diffuse\naurora during the main phase of the 19 October 1998 storm\n(minimum Dst = \u0002112 nT) by using the AMIE electric field\ncorresponding to this storm. Figure 1 shows traces of the\nDst index, total AMIE cross-polar-cap potential (DF), and\ncomponents (Bx, By, Bz) of the interplanetary magnetic field\nmeasured by the IMP, WIND, and ACE satellites during\n18\u201321 October 1998. Figure 1e shows that during the main\nphase of this storm Bz did not vary widely (only between\n\u0001\u000211 nT and\u000218 nT). The dashed vertical lines in Figure 1\ncorrespond to selected times of interest (0800 UT, 0950 UT,\n1030 UT, and 1100 UT) during the main phase. Figure 2\nshows the equatorial AMIE electric field intensity jEj,\nevaluated in the Earth\u2019s corotating frame, at these times of\ninterest. Figure 2 thus illustrates the spatial and temporal\nvariability of the AMIE electric field during the storm main\nphase. At 0800 UT the AMIE electric field intensity was\nA03210 CHEN ET AL.: STORM TIME DIFFUSE AURORAL SIMULATIONS\n3 of 19\nA03210\nquite strong (>2 mV\/m) near dusk at L \u0001 3\u20137, as well as in\nthe evening sector at L ^ 4 and in the morning sector at L \u0001\n3\u20136. Electric fields with intensity >2 mV\/m spanned\nregions of narrower radial extent (but still significant) at\nlater times of interest (at 0950 UT, 1030 UT, and 1130 UT).\n[13] In Figure 3, we plot contours of constant electron\nHamiltonian (or total energy) per unit charge (units of keV)\nat 0800 UT on 19 October 1998. We considered that the\nelectric field was frozen in time. The dotted circles at b =\n12.82 RE in the equatorial plane (upper panels) correspond\nto the neutral line and thus to the outer boundary of our\nmodel. The contours of constant Hamiltonian correspond to\nquasi-steady state electron drift paths. Figure 3a shows such\ncontours for L = L4 (the value of L for corresponding to\nkinetic energy E = 4 keV at r0 = 6 RE) for the AMIE electric\nfield at 0800 UT on 19 October 1998. The plus signs mark\n10-min intervals as electrons would drift from the nightside\nneutral line. For comparison, Figure 3b shows quasi-steady\ndrift paths based on a simplified convection electric field\nmodel that we had been using in the past [Chen and Schulz,\n2001a, 2001b]. This simplified convection model, to which\nthe corotation potential must be added as in (3), was based\non an electrostatic potential function\nFsimp L;f\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc V0\n2\nL\nL *\n\u0006 \u00072\nsinf\u00fe DV t\u00f0 \u00de\n2\nL\nL *\n\u0006 \u0007\nsinf: \u00f08\u00de\nThe first term of (8) corresponds to a shielded time-\nindependent electric field [Volland, 1973, 1975; Stern,\n1974, 1975] with V0 = 25 kV; the second term corresponds\nto a time-variable unshielded electric field [Nishida, 1966;\nBrice, 1967]. The quasi drift paths in Figure 3b are\nFigure 1.

The dashed vertical lines correspond to 0800 UT, 0950 UT, 1030 UT, and 1130 UT on 19\nOctober 1998.\nA03210 CHEN ET AL.: STORM TIME DIFFUSE AURORAL SIMULATIONS\n4 of 19\nA03210\ncalculated for DV = 150.5 kV so as to match the total cross-\npolar-cap potential (V0 + DV = 175.5 kV) in the AMIE\nmodel at 0800 UT on 19 October 1998. Unlike the quasi\ndrift paths in the simplified electric model (Figure 3b), the\nAMIE quasi-steady drift paths (Figure 3a) are not\nsymmetric between day and night. The extra strength of\nthe AMIE electric field in the evening sector leads to larger\ndrift rates there and leads to rapid access of electrons from\nthe nightside neutral line to R0 \r 4 near dusk for electrons\nwith energies of 0 to 64 keV at R0 = 6. Examples of\nequatorial AMIE quasi-steady drift paths for electrons with\nenergies of 0, 5, 13, and 38 keVat R0 = 6 for 0800 UT on 19\nOctober 1998 were shown in Figure 9 of Chen et al. [2003].\nThose quasi-drift paths corresponded to electrons that\nconserved their first two invariants rather than L, but they\nqualitatively illustrated the same quasi-drift topology as is\nseen in Figure 3a here for a wide range of plasma sheet\nelectron energies. More generally, Chen et al. [2003] found\nthat during storm main phases the AMIE electric equipo-\ntentials tend to be concentrated in some narrow sector of\nMLT on the nightside so as to yield rapid inward transport\nof particles from the nightside neutral line to low L values in\nthat sector.\n[14] To illustrate the significance of these quasi-drift\npaths for the diffuse aurora, we map them by means of\n(1) to an altitude h = 0.02 RE = 127.4 km in the auroral\nionosphere. Figures 3c and 3d show such mappings of the\ndrift paths for L = L4 (subscripts on L denote the\ncorresponding kinetic energy in keV at r0 = 6 RE) shown\nin Figures 3a and 3b, respectively. In our polar region plots\nthe azimuthal coordinate j still represents magnetic local\ntime (MLT), but the \u2018\u2018radial\u2019\u2019 coordinate is the value of sin q\nat r = a + h = 1.02 RE. The dotted circles here correspond to\nvalues of sin qh at latitudes of 80\u0002, 70\u0002, 60\u0002, and 50\u0002. All\npolar region plots shown in this paper have this same format\nand correspond to an altitude of 127.4 km. From Figures 3c\nand 3d, one can see how the representative quasi-drift paths\nfrom the plasma sheet would map equatorward of the polar\ncap, which is bounded by a fixed circle at 70\u0002 latitude on the\nEarth (69.8\u0002 at r = a + h) in our specification of Dungey\u2019s\nmodel magnetosphere. Figure 3c shows that the plasma\nsheet electrons could reach latitudes as low as \u000152\u0002 in the\nevening sector where the AMIE electric field is strongest at\n0800 UT on 19 October 1998, if the AMIE electric field\nwere constant in time. Figure 3d shows that plasma sheet\nelectrons in the simplified electric field model (with the\nFigure 2.

The white dashed curve at 2.54 RE maps to\nthe AMIE transitional latitude of 50\u0002 in our magnetic field model.\nA03210 CHEN ET AL.: STORM TIME DIFFUSE AURORAL SIMULATIONS\n5 of 19\nA03210\nsame total cross polar cap potential drop here as in the\nAMIE model) reach the lowest latitudes (\u000149\u0002) at dawn.\n[15] Quasi-steady drift paths are useful for illustrating the\ndrift topology. However, for our actual simulations we\ncalculate drift caused by a time-varying AMIE electric field.\nWe linearly interpolate between 5-min AMIE coefficients to\nobtain the time-dependent coefficients aj(t) in (4). Bounce-\naveraged drift rates for electrons in strong pitch-angle\ndiffusion are easily derived from the Hamiltonian function\n[see Schulz, 1998]. We solve the drift equations numerically\nby using the Bulirsch-Stoer extrapolation method [e.g.,\nPress et al., 1986, pp. 563\u2013569]. Here we perform these\nsimulations for eight L values (corresponding to energies\n0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 32, and 64 keV at R0 = 6, which\ncorresponds to L \r 5.707 in our model) and interpolate as\nnecessary. In the field model that we use here, an equatorial\nradial distance of R0 = 6 maps to 65\u0002 latitude at r = a + h =\n1.02 RE. For each L value of interest we set up a grid of\nabout 2000\u20133000 points spaced every 5\u0002 in longitude and\nevery 0.01 in sin qh. We start our representative electrons on\nthe magnetic field lines corresponding to these grid points\nand then run the simulation backward in time, thereby\ntracing the trajectories back to where and when the electrons\nwould have been very close to the boundary of our model\n(L \r 8.5).\n[16] It is instructive to compute the transport time Dt\nrequired for a plasma sheet electron to drift from the\nboundary of our model (i.e., from the neutral line) to any\nfield line of interest. The transport times Dt for electrons\nhaving L = L4 during the main phase of the 19 October\n1998 storm are shown in Figures 4a (0800 UT), 4b\n(0950 UT), 4c (1030 UT), and 4d (1130 UT). The color\nscale indicates the drift time required for an electron to have\nreached the indicated latitude and longitude at r = a + h at\neach of the four times of interest. In these examples, the\ntransport times to 60\u0002 latitude (R0 = 4.2) are \u00013\u20135 hours on\nthe nightside, >5 hours near dawn, 2 hours in the afternoon\nquadrant, and 2 hours at dusk.\n2.3. Loss Rates\n[17] We take account of loss due to precipitation as the\nelectrons drift. In this study we consider two different\nmodels for electron pitch-angle scattering.

In this study, we directly compare auroral obser-\nvations with simulated distributions of precipitating electron\nenergy flux and emitted X-ray flux obtained from these two\nscattering models, so as to infer realistic estimates of\nscattering rates.\n2.3.1. Loss Due to Strong Pitch-Angle Diffusion\n(Model 1)\n[18] The lifetime t against strong pitch-angle diffusion\ncan be expressed [Schulz, 1974a] as\nt \u00bc gm0=p\u00f0 \u00de 2YBh= 1\u0002 h\u00f0 \u00de\u00bd \t; \u00f09\u00de\nwhere the quantity Bh in (9) denotes the field intensity at\neither foot point of the field line of interest in a centered-\ndipole model, and the factor g(=m\/m0) denotes the ratio\nof the relativistic mass m to the rest mass m0 for the\nparticles of interest. The backscatter coefficient h is an\nadjustable parameter of the model. For this study we\nspecify h = 0.25 (independent of incident electron energy)\nso that 25% of the electrons that would mirror at or\nbelow the altitude h(=0.02 RE) are scattered back into the\nflux tube instead of precipitating into the atmosphere.\nFigure 5 shows (Figure 5a) equatorial and (Figure 5b)\npolar projections of the lifetime against strong pitch-angle\ndiffusion for electrons having L = L4. From Figure 5a\none can see that the strong-diffusion lifetime t increases\nmonotonically with R0 at a given value of L because of\nthe factor C in (9). The lifetime against strong diffusion\nfor 4-keV electrons at R0 = 6 (L \r 5.7 in the present\nfield model, corresponding to 65\u0002 latitude in Figure 5b) is\nabout 20 min.

A Model for MLT-Dependent Pitch-Angle\nDiffusion Less Than Everywhere Strong (Model 2)\n[19] Strong pitch-angle diffusion is a limiting idealization.\nSome observations [e.g., Stiles et al., 1978] show nearly\nisotropic plasma sheet pitch-angle distributions, but other\nparticle observations [Fairfield and Vin\u02dcas, 1984; Schumaker\net al., 1989] and wave measurements [Gough et al., 1979;\nBelmont et al., 1983; Roeder and Koons, 1989; Koons and\nRoeder, 1990; Meredith et al., 1999, 2000] suggest that\npitch-angle scattering may not always be strong throughout\nthe plasma sheet. Our previous simulations [Chen and\nSchulz, 2001a] of storm time diffuse aurora with plasma\nsheet electrons in strong pitch-angle diffusion also show the\nneed for a model in which plasma sheet pitch-angle diffu-\nsion is less than everywhere strong.\n[20] Unfortunately, there are very few (if any) reported\nmeasurements of electron lifetimes in the plasma sheet,\nespecially at energies (\u00010.1\u2013100 keV) of interest in this\nstudy. In an earlier study we formulated a model for pitch-\nangle diffusion less than everywhere strong. This model was\nbased on theoretical electron lifetimes against weak diffusion\n[Albert, 1994] intended for application to radiation-belt\nelectrons. For application to plasma sheet electrons we\nextrapolated Albert\u2019s results to higher L values and lower\nenergies. Then we renormalized to match empirical lifetimes\n[Roberts, 1969;VanAllen, 1969]. The scattering ratel thatwe\nthus obtain is well approximated by the expression\nl0 E;L\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc min 0:08 E;MeV\u00f0 \u00de\u00021:32;\nh\n0:4\u000e 10 2L\u00026\u00fe0:4 log2 E\u00f0 \u00de\u00f0 \u00de\ni\nday\u00021; \u00f010\u00de\nwhere energy E is measured in units of MeV. (Our\nequation (10) here corrects a typographical error in\nequation (5a) in the paper of Chen and Schulz [2001b],\nwhich provides specific details on how this scattering-rate\nFigure 5. (a) Equatorial intercepts and (b) polar projections of the lifetime against strong pitch angle\ndiffusion given by (9) for electrons with L = L4. (c) Equatorial intercepts and (d) polar projections of the\nelectron lifetime against MLT-dependent diffusion given by (11) and (12) for electrons with L = L4.\nA03210 CHEN ET AL.: STORM TIME DIFFUSE AURORAL SIMULATIONS\n8 of 19\nA03210\nmodel was formulated.) The scattering rate approximated by\n(10) pertains only to wave-particle interactions. Coulomb\nscattering has been treated by Walt [1964], Lyons and\nThorne [1973], and Abel and Thorne [1998] but we neglect\nit here because the theoretical lifetimes of Lyons and Thorne\n[1973] show that lifetimes against wave-particle interactions\nare significantly shorter than those against Coulomb\nscattering beyond L \u0001 3.5 for energies of 10\u201320 keV. For\nexample, a 10-keV electron at L = 5 has a Coulomb lifetime\nof \u0001100 days, whereas (1) yields a lifetime \u00012.7 hours\nagainst wave-particle interactions.\n[21] Observations of wave activity in the equatorial mag-\nnetosphere indicate that the scattering rate depends onMLTas\nwell as on R0. For example, Koons and Roeder [1990]\nsurveyed ELF\/VLF wave activity in the frequency range\n0.1\u20135 kHz detected by the SCATHA satellite\u2019s VLF receiver\nnear the magnetic equator at r \r 5\u20138 RE. Hiss, discrete\nwhistler mode emissions, and electron cyclotron harmonic\nwaves (ECH) occur within this frequency range. Koons and\nRoeder [1990] reported the probability of detecting wave\nactivity above the threshold of SCATHA\u2019s broadband VLF\nreceiver as a function of R0 and MLT. They found that wave\nactivity was notably absent from 1800 to 2100 MLT and\nrelatively abundant from 0300 to 1200 MLT. The SCATHA\nwave data have not yet been analyzed statistically to reveal the\nmean amplitude ormean intensity as a function of L andMLT.\nRecently, J. L. Roeder (private communication, 2004) ana-\nlyzed SCATHA wave amplitudes in the frequency range of\n0.1\u20131.0 Hz for two large magnetic storms. He found that the\nMLT distribution of amplitudes (\u000f5 \u000e 10\u00024 mV\/m) during\nthese storms to be consistent with the MLT distribution of the\nstatistical surveys [Roeder and Koons, 1989; Koons and\nRoeder, 1990]. During the main phases of these two storms,\nthe most largest wave amplitudes tended to occur around\n0400 MLT.\n[22] Motivated by such wave observations, we have\nmodeled the MLT-dependence of the scattering rate so that\nl E; L;f\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc 1\u00fe a1 sin f\u00fe f0\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe a2 cos 2 f\u00fe f0\u00f0 \u00de\u00bd \tl0 E; L\u00f0 \u00de;\n\u00f011\u00de\nwhere l0(E, L) is the azimuthally averaged scattering rate\nspecified by (10) and j is the MLT coordinate. The\ncoefficients a1, a2, and j0 are adjustable parameters in this\ntruncated Fourier expansion. In our earlier work we\nmodeled the MLT dependence of the scattering rate l(j)\ndirectly from the SCATHA wave occurrence frequency\ndistribution of Koons and Roeder [1990] with a1 = 0.8, a2 =\n0, and j0 = \u0002p\/4. In that model l(j) reached a maximum\nvalue (=1.8 l0) at j = 0900 MLT and reaches a minimum\nvalue(=0.2 l0) at j = 2100 MLT around any magnetic shell.\n(See Chen and Schulz [2001b] for further details on this\nformulation.) With that MLT-dependent scattering rate we\naccounted qualitatively for intensifications of diffuse auroral\nelectron precipitation found near dawn and late in the\nmorning quadrant in both statistical and storm event studies\n[Chen and Schulz, 2001b]. In this study we find it revealing\nto adjust the parameters a1, a2, and j0 to obtain somewhat\nbetter agreement between the azimuthal distribution of\nsimulated electron precipitation patterns and those inferred\nfrom averaged NOAA electron precipitation data and storm\ntime Polar (UVI and PIXIE) images (presented later). With\na1 = 1.2, a2 = \u00020.25 * a1, j0 = p\/6 in (11), the scattering\nrate l(j) reaches a maximum value (=2.6 l0) peaking at\n0400 MLT and a broad minimum value (=0.6 l0) at\n2200 MLT. This produces less scattering in the evening and\nmore scattering in the morning, which is consistent with\nboth the storm time results of J. L. Roeder (private\ncommunication, 2004) and with the statistical results of\nKoons and Roeder [1990].\n[23] A simple model [Schulz, 1979b] for the loss rate\n\u0001l(j), providing a smooth transition between weak pitch-\nangle diffusion (lt \u0010 1) and strong diffusion (lt \u0011 1), is\n\u0001l j\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc 1\u00fe l j\u00f0 \u00det\u00bd \t\u00021l j\u00f0 \u00de; \u00f012\u00de\nwhere t is the lifetime against strong diffusion. The color-\ncoded lifetime 1\/\u0001l for electrons with L = L4 is shown in\nFigure 5c as a function of (R0, j) and equivalently in\nFigure 5d as a function of (qh, j) at r = a + h. For R0 > 9, the\nlifetime approximates that found in the limit of strong pitch-\nangle diffusion (cf. Figures 5a and 5c). For R0 < 4, the\nlifetimes 1\/\u0001l in Figure 5 correspond approximately to the\nlimit of weak pitch-angle diffusion regardless of MLT. At\nR0 = 6, however, the lifetime range of 1\/\u0001l specified by (12)\nfor a 4-keV electron ranges from 25 min at 0400 MLT\n(which is approximately equal to the strong-diffusion\nlifetime) to 3.8 hours at 1600 MLT (which is approximately\nequal to the weak diffusion limit).\n2.4. Phase Space Mapping\n[24] Having treated plasma sheet electrons for kinematic\npurposes as if they were in strong diffusion, we map the\nstorm time phase-space density f for each value of L\naccording to Liouville\u2019s theorem, except that we attenuate\nf by the factor exp(\u0002R \u0001ldt) along each drift trajectory to\naccount for the rate \u0001l specified by (12) at which electrons\nare lost from their respective flux tubes because of pitch-\nangle scattering. This approach represents a kinematical\ncompromise that we believe is well justified (see below).\nUnder strong pitch-angle diffusion, the differential omnidi-\nrectional electron flux J4p for any value of L would be\ninstantaneously uniform along any field line of interest, and\nso we could identify f = J4p\/4pp\n2 as in our earlier work\n[Schulz and Chen, 1999; Chen and Schulz, 2001a]. This\nwould constitute a form of adiabatic motion in which L\n(rather than the first two invariants M and J) is conserved. It\nis tantamount to the approach used in the Rice Convection\nModel (RCM) [Harel et al., 1981].\n[25] Our phase-space mapping differs from the approach\nof Fontaine and Blanc [1983], who computed the transport\nand precipitation of plasma sheet electrons in the limit of\nstrong pitch-angle diffusion by using fluid equations. As-\nsuming Maxwellian electron distributions and a uniform\nelectron density in each flux tube, they solved the electron\nmass and energy conservation equations after imposing a\nprescribed temperature profile at their boundary (i.e., at L =\n10 in a dipole field).\n[26] We admit that we are making a kinematical compro-\nmise whenever pitch-angle diffusion is less than strong (as\nin scattering models 2 and 3). This point was discussed by\nChen and Schulz [2001b]. The base for our kinematical\ncompromise is that even in the absence of pitch-angle\ndiffusion, particles starting with the same field line with\nA03210 CHEN ET AL.: STORM TIME DIFFUSE AURORAL SIMULATIONS\n9 of 19\nA03210\nthe same energy but with different equatorial pitch angles\n(e.g., a0 = 90\u0002 and a0 = 0\u0002) would still drift at similar rates\nalong similar paths [e.g., Chen et al., 1998].\n2.5. Boundary Conditions\n[27] We use electron fluxes at geosynchronous orbit pro-\nvided by theMagnetospheric Particle Analyzer (MPA) instru-\nments on Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) satellites\nto construct our boundary conditions for f. The MPA is an\nelectrostatic analyzer thatmeasures three-dimensional energy\nper charge (\u00011 eV\/q to \u000140 keV\/q) distributions of ions and\nelectrons. See Bame et al. [1993] andMcComas et al. [1993]\nfor a complete description of the instrument. Figure 6a shows\nexamples of LANL\/MPA electron phase space spectra\nthat correspond to five different MLT values, ranging from\n0000 MLT to 0600 MLT on 19 October 1998. For each\nspectrum in Figure 6a the corresponding UT is 0.53 hours\nearlier than the MLT (UT = MLT \u0002 0.53 hours) because this\nparticular LANL satellite is located at 8\u0002E geographic longi-\ntude. The symbols correspond to the actual LANL data, while\nthe curves are cubic-spline interpolations through these\npoints. Figure 6a shows considerable variability in the spec-\ntral hardness of the geosynchronous electron distributionwith\nMLTand\/orUT.Themain phase of the 19October 1998 storm\nstarted around 0500 UT. Unfortunately, the available LANL\nsatellites were on the dayside through most times of interest\n(\u00010800 UT to 1130 UT) during the main phase of the\n19 October 1998 storm. They therefore do not necessarily\nprovide a good representation of the nightside electron\nplasma sheet distributions. We select the phase space spec-\ntrum at 4.53 MLT as representative of geosynchronous orbit\nfor this storm, realizing that this is an oversimplification of the\ntrue time-dependent storm time spectrum.\n[28] We construct the phase space spectrum f * at the\nboundary of our model at L = Lc < L* = 8.5466, where Lc\ndenotes the largest value of L for which electrons of\nspecified L could gyrate without escaping across the neutral\nline. Determination of this critical value of L as a function of\nL is explained in detail by Chen and Schulz [2001a]. We\nmap the selected phase-space spectrum from geosynchro-\nnous orbit outward to L, multiplying f by the factor exp\n(\nR\n(1\/t) dt), where t is the lifetime against strong diffusion\ngiven by (9). For simplicity, the time integral of (1\/t) is\ncalculated along a trajectory from midnight at geosynchro-\nnous orbit to Lc. The equatorial radial distance with which\nwe associate the LANL geosynchronous data in our axi-\nsymmetric magnetic field model is not R0 = 6.6 but rather\nthe distance R0 = 5.47 where the equatorial magnetic field\nintensity equals that given by the empirically based mag-\nnetic field model of Tsyganenko [1989] for Kp > 6\u0002 at R0 =\n6.6 at midnight. We think it is more appropriate to match the\nequatorial magnetic field value at which the observational\ndata were probably acquired than to match the actual\naltitude of the satellite. Figure 6b shows the selected LANL\ngeosynchronous electron phase-space spectrum (squares) at\n4.53 MLT at geosynchronous (squares) and its mapping to\nL = Lc. We use the cubic spline interpolations (solid curves)\nto model smooth spectra for f and f * in Figure 6.\n3. Simulation Results\n3.1. Energy Flux\n[29] We compute the differential and integral energy flux\ndistributions of electrons precipitating into the ionosphere\nfrom the mapped phase-space densities (for each of our\nthree different electron scattering models) for the selected\nFigure 6. (a) Phase space spectra at geosynchronous altitude at different MLT and UT(=MLT \u0002\n0.53 hours) on 19 October 1998.

This spectrum is mapped to the boundary of our model and shown as the solid curve. The\ncrosses correspond to the boundary phase space spectrum at eight different L(=L0.25, L0.5, L1, L2, L4,\nL8, L16, and L32) values.\nA03210 CHEN ET AL.: STORM TIME DIFFUSE AURORAL SIMULATIONS\n10 of 19\nA03210\ntimes of interest during the 19 October 1998 storm. Our\nmethod for computing the differential and integral energy\nfluxes is explained in detail by Chen and Schulz [2001b].\nOur integral energy flux is given by an integral of the\ndifferential energy flux over all energies. Here we compare\nthe simulated energy fluxes with a statistically averaged\ndistribution of electron energy flux based on NOAA\nmeasurements and with UVI images from NASA\u2019s Polar\nsatellite.\n[30] Spatial distributions of energy flux (color coded in\nunits of erg cm\u00022 s\u00021) are shown in Figure 7. Simulated\nenergy fluxes for scattering rate model 1 (strong pitch-angle\ndiffusion) for 19 October 1998 at 1030 UT and 1130 UT are\nshown in Figures 7a and 7b, respectively. Under strong\npitch-angle scattering the simulated energy flux attains a\nmaximum value of 29.0 erg cm\u00022 s\u00021 at 65.2\u0002 latitude and\n2140 MLT at 1030 UT. At 1130 UT, the energy flux attains\na maximum value of 40.2 erg cm\u00022 s\u00021 at 64.5\u0002 latitude and\n2300 MLT. In both examples the most intense energy flux\n(red) in the evening quadrant at latitudes of \u000163\u0002\u201367\u0002\nlatitude. This is where the strong diffusion lifetimes (\u000120\u2013\n30 min for 1\u20134-keV electrons) are comparable to the drift\naccess times (\u000120\u201330 min) from the neutral line of the\nmodel (cf. Figures 4 and 5b). As in our earlier simulations,\nwe find that the differential energy-flux spectrum peaks at\nenergies \u00014 keV at R0 = 6 RE. (We do not show such\ndifferential energy-flux spectra here, but examples from a\ndifferent study are illustrated in Figure 1 of Chen and Schulz\n[2001b].) Thus the maximum energy flux corresponding to\na match between the drift and loss timescales of 4-keV\nelectrons are representative of the precipitating electron\npopulation. Because the lifetimes against strong pitch-angle\ndiffusion are shorter than the transport times to the dayside\nmagnetosphere, most electrons would have precipitated\nbefore they could drift around to the dayside.\n[31] For comparison, we show the simulated distribution\nof energy flux obtained with scattering rate model 2 (MLT-\ndependent diffusion) for 19 October 1998 at 1030 UT and\n1130 UT in Figures 7c and 7d. The region of energy flux\n>1 erg cm\u00022 s\u00021 tends to be more widely distributed in MLT\nunder model 2 than under model 1 (strong diffusion). This\nmakes sense, in that under the MLT-dependent scattering\nmodel more electrons are able to drift around to dawn and to\nthe dayside with scattering rate model 2 because the lifetimes\nare generally longer there than under strong diffusion. The\nmaximum energy flux (10.6 erg cm\u00022 s\u00021) occurs at 63.9\u0002\nlatitude and 0420 MLT in Figure 7c. The maximum energy\nflux (11.3 erg cm\u00022 s\u00021) is attained at 63.9\u0002 latitude and\n0300 MLT in Figure 7d. These peak values are notably\nsmaller than the corresponding peak values under strong\ndiffusion. Conversely, the region of energy flux under\nscattering model 2 extends from premidnight to postdawn\nat \u000163\u0002\u201365\u0002 latitude. Our MLT-dependent scattering rate\nyields the shortest lifetimes around 0400 MLT (see\nFigures 5c and 5d). Although the pattern of precipitating\nenergy flux tends to be more spread out in MLT under model\n2 than under model 1, the total rate of energy deposition into\nthe ionosphere at 127 km altitude is roughly the same under\nmodel 1 (4.81 \u000e 1019 ergs\/s) as under model 2 (4.87 \u000e\n1019 erg\/s) at 1030 UT on 19 October 1998. The total rate of\nenergy is calculated by integrating the integral energy flux\nover r2 d(cos qh) dj at r = (a + h).\n[32] To assess which scattering model produces the more\nrealistic diffuse aurora, we compare our simulated energy-\nflux distributions with observed energy flux distributions.\nFor orientation, we first examine 10-year averages of NOAA-\n12 energy flux data (for corresponding values of Dst) for\nelectrons with energies ranging from 379 eV to 902 keV. The\nenergy flux is derived from the Total Energy Detector (TED),\nan electrostatic analyzer, and the Medium Energy Proton and\nElectron Detector (MEPED), a solid-state detector, of the\nSpace Environment Monitor. Details about the two NOAA-\n12 instruments can be found in the work of Raben et al.\n[1995]. Information regarding the generation of the NOAA-\n12 averaged precipitation flux can be found in the work of\nWu\u00a8est et al. [2005]. The electron data corresponding to\nthe Dst bin from \u000280 nT to \u0002110 nT are averaged over the\n10-year period spanning 1 June 1991 through 31 July 2001.\nThe times of interest during the main phase of the 19 October\n1998 storm correpond to Dst values that fall within the\n\u000280 nT to \u0002110 nT bin. Figure 7e shows a plot of the\naveraged NOAA-12 energy flux data in the southern hemi-\nsphere with the same color scale as the simulated energy flux\nplots in Figure 7. Data coverage was sparse at low latitudes\nfrom about 2200 MLT to 0300 MLT. Statistically, the\naveraged energy fluxes above 1 erg cm\u00022 s\u00021 tended to occur\nroughly between 1700 MLT to 0900 MLT.\n[33] Comparing the simulated storm time energy flux\nunder model 1 (Figures 7a and 7b) with the averaged\nNOAA data (Figure 7e), one can see that the simulated\nstorm time energy flux with strong diffusion tends to be\nmuch more intense than what is statistically observed in the\nevening sector. In contrast, the simulated storm time energy\nflux under model 2 (Figures 7c and 7d) tends to have\ncomparable magnitudes with the observed average energy\nfluxes although the maximum energy flux from the simu-\nlations is somewhat higher than the maximum 10-year\naverage energy flux. The spatial extent of the simulated\nstorm time energy flux under model 2 agrees quite well with\nthe averaged NOAA data. Thus we conclude that the\nsimulations with our MLT-dependent scattering rate produce\na more realistic storm time diffuse aurora than does a model\nbased on strong diffusion (at least in a statistical sense).\nLater, we will compare our simulated electron energy flux\nwith the electron energy flux inferred from Polar\/UVI\nimages at selected times during the 19 October 1998 storm.\n3.2. X-ray Flux\n[34] For comparison with auroral Polar\/PIXIE X-ray\nimages, we also compute the simulated X-ray flux. To\ncalculate the simulated X-ray flux, we need to apply what\nis known about the X-ray production by electrons incident\nthe atmosphere. The thick target Brehmsstrahlung spectrum\nproduced by incident electrons in the atmosphere was\ncomputed and the spectrum was multiplied by the detector\nefficiency and integrated over X-ray energies of 2 to 12 keV.\nWe chose X-ray energies of 2 to 12 keV because this is the\nX-ray energy range of data collected from the front chamber\nof the PIXIE instrument that was used to produce the PIXIE\nimages shown in this paper. (See a description of the\ninstrument later in this section.) Figure 8 shows a plot of\nthe intensity of 2\u201312 keV X rays [10\u00025\/cm2 s sr] per\nelectron differential number flux [1\/cm2 s sr] as a function\nof incident electron energy [keV].

The production efficiency increases\nmonotonically with increasing incident electron energy. To\ncompute the simulated X-ray intensity from the atmosphere\nfor a given incident electron energy, we weight the simu-\nlated electron differential number flux with the X-ray\nproduction efficiency shown in Figure 8.\n[35] Distributions of simulated X-ray intensity (2\u201312 keV)\nfor 19 October 1998 at 3 selected times in units of cm\u00022 sr\u00021\ns\u00021 are shown in Figure 9. The left column corresponds to\nscattering rate model 1 (strong pitch-angle diffusion). Sim-\nulated X-ray intensities computed with this model are too\nstrong at the peaks and too narrowly distributed inMLTwhen\ncompared (see next subsection) with PIXIE data. For exam-\nple, model 1 yields a peak X-ray intensity of 1.8\u000e 104 cm\u00022\nsr\u00021 s\u00021 (at 65.2\u0002 latitude and 2140 MLT) for 1030 UT\n(Figure 9b), and 2.8 \u000e 104 cm\u00022 sr\u00021 s\u00021 (at 64.5\u0002 latitude\nand 2320MLT) for 1130 UT (Figure 9c) on 19 October 1998.\nThese maximum values exceed by factors \u00012\u20133 the\ncorresponding maximum X-ray intensities measured by\nPIXIE (see below). With scattering model 2, the maximum\nsimulated storm time X-ray intensities are approximately\nsmaller than those found with scattering model 1. The\nmaximum simulated X-ray intensities are 8 \u000e 103 cm\u00022\nsr\u00021 s\u00021 (at 62.6\u0002 latitude and 0420 MLT) for 1030 UT\n(Figure 9e) and 9 \u000e 103 cm\u00022 sr\u00021 s\u00021 (at 63.3\u0002 latitude and\n0320MLT) for 1130 UT (Figure 9d). These maximum values\nare similar to the corresponding maximum X-ray intensities\nobserved by PIXIE at these times (see below).\n3.3. Comparisons of Simulation Results With Auroral\nImages\n[36] In Figures 10\u201312 we compare our simulation results\nfrom the MLT-dependent scattering model 2 directly with\nauroral images taken from the Polar satellite during the main\nphase of the 19 October 1998 storm using PIXIE and UVI\nimages. Anderson et al. [2000a, 2000b] reported on the\nglobal auroral X-ray and ultraviolet morphology of the 19\nOctober 1998 storm. In this paper we focus on comparing\nour simulation results with auroral images in order to assess\nwhat observed features can and cannot be explained by our\nmodel. Thus our description of the instrumentation and data\nanalysis will be very brief.\n[37] Polar\u2019s ultraviolet imager (UVI) consists of a three-\nmirror optical system with several filters and an intensi-\nfied-CCD detector [Torr et al., 1995]. Two filters cover the\nfar-ultraviolet Lyman-Birge-Hopfield N2 emission band: the\nLBHs (s = short, 140\u2013160 nm) and the LBHl (l = long, 160\u2013\n180 nm). In this paper we show images from the LBHl filter.\nAt LBHl wavelengths the atmospheric Schumann-Runge\n(O2) absorption is negligible. Thus the emission intensity\nfor LBHl is directly correlated with the total precipitating\nelectron energy flux. The UVI field-of-view does not cover\nthe entire oval; UVI was primarily imaging the morningside\naurora throughout the main phase of the 19 October 1998\nstorm. Figure 10a shows the electron energy flux derived\nfrom the UVI image at 0948:37 UTon 19 October 1998. The\nblack circles indicate magnetic latitudes 80\u0002, 70\u0002, 60\u0002, and\n50\u0002. Figure 10a shows that the region of inferred electron\nenergy flux greater than 10 erg cm\u00022 s\u00021 extends at least from\n2000 MLT through midnight past dawn and around to the\ndayside.\n[38] For comparison, Figure 10b shows the distribution of\nsimulated electron energy flux from scattering rate model 2\nat 0950 UT on 19 October 1998 on the same logarithmic\ncolor scale. The simulated electron energy flux exceeds\n10 erg cm\u00022 s\u00021 from about 2000 MLT through midnight to\nabout 1000 MLT, which is in good agreement with the UVI\nobservations (Figure 10a). We admit that our simulations do\nnot take into account the effect of discrete auroral arcs. Thus\nthe UVI data may well show intensifications of the electron\nenergy flux at high latitudes that our simulations may not\nreproduce. Indeed, the UVI image in Figure 10a shows\nintensification of energy flux 20 erg cm\u00022 s\u00021 (extending\nfrom \u000165\u0002 magnetic latitude (MLAT) at 2300 MLT to\n\u000164\u0002 MLAT at 0100 MLT) that the simulations do not\nfully reproduce. Our simulations also do not currently take\ninto account the effect of the proton aurora that contributes\nto the auroral emissions within the UVI filter response.\nSince protons drift eastward, it is expected that the protons\nwould likely precipitate in the dusk to midnight sector. The\nUVI energy flux is somewhat more intense in the pre-\nmidnight sector near the equatorward part of the oval than\nthe simulated energy flux. Nonetheless, the simulated and\nUVI derived energy flux agree well in the overall strength\nand azimuthal extent at this time (0950 UT) during the main\nphase of the storm.\n[39] PIXIE is a multiple-aperture pinhole camera\ndesigned to image the entire auroral oval in X rays of\nenergy 2\u201360 keV. For descriptions of the PIXIE instru-\nment, see Imhof et al. [1995] and Anderson et al.\n[2000a]. The PIXIE images presented in this paper are\nproduced from data taken from PIXIE\u2019s front chamber,\nwhich receives X rays of energy 2\u201312 keV (PIXIE\u2019s rear\nchamber, 10\u201360 keV, had failed on 27 September 1998.).\nFigure 10c shows an image of the integrated X-ray\nintensities observed by PIXIE that were accumulated from\n0948:38 UT to 0950:30 UT on 19 October 1998. The\nprojected geographic location of each photon was calcu-\nlated assuming a 100-km source altitude and was con-\nverted to magnetic coordinates by using the International\nGeomagnetic Reference Field, 1995 (IGRF95).

Contours of\nconstant magnetic latitude (MLAT) are shown as dotted\nyellow curves. The imaged area is within the red box.\nFor reference, the white circle in Figure 10c shows the\nfield of view of UVI. The PIXIE image shows X-ray\nintensities >1100 cm\u00022 s\u00021 sr\u00021 at a region extending\nfrom \u00011800 MLT through midnight to dawn, with the\nhighest X-ray intensities near dusk. The \u2018\u2018CXI\u2019\u2019 label\nrefers to the aliased astronomical X-ray source Cirinus\nX-1. CXI is a point source, and so its image reveals\nspatial resolution. Anderson et al. [2000a] pointed out the\nenhancement of X-ray brightness at dusk (cf. Figure 10c)\nand discussed this feature in detail. They found that the\ngeosynchronous Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL)\nsatellites measured enhanced electron fluxes in the pre-\ndusk region at the same time when PIXIE observed enhanced\nX-ray emissions in the postdusk region. Anderson et al.\n[2000a, 2000b] suggested that partially localized pitch-angle\nscattering and field-aligned electron acceleration might\naccount for the intensification of the X-ray emissions in the\npostdusk region.\n[40] Figure 10d shows the distribution of simulated\nX-ray intensity for scattering rate model 2 for comparison\nwith the PIXIE X-ray image in Figure 10c. The simulated\nX-ray intensity exceeds 1100 cm\u00022 s\u00021 sr\u00021 from roughly\n2200 MLT to the dayside at 1000 MLT. The simulated\nX-ray intensity for scattering-rate model 2 does not\nreproduce high X-ray intensities seen near dusk in\nFigure 10c; the brightest simulated X-ray fluxes occur\nbetween midnight and postdawn. With strong pitch-angle\nscattering everywhere as in scattering-rate model 1 (see\nFigure 9a, noting the different color bar scale), the\nsimulated X-ray intensity is highest at 2100\u20132300 MLT\nnear dusk and shows a secondary maximum (still over\ntwice the observed maximum) near dusk. Simulations\nwith scattering-rate model 1 would not account for the\n>1100 cm\u00022 s\u00021 sr\u00021 X-ray intensity between premidnight to\ndawn that is observed by PIXIE. Thus the simulated X-ray\nintensities with scattering-rate models 1 or 2 do not agree well\nwith the PIXIE observations for this time of interest. This\nfinding is consistent with the suggestion of Anderson et al.\n[2000a, 2000b] that the intense X-ray emissions in the\nFigure 10. (a) Image of the UVI electron energy flux at 0948 UT.

The\nsimulation results shown correspond to those with scatter-\ning-rate model 1. The simulated precipitating electron and\nUVI energy fluxes in Figure 11b agree well with those\ninferred from the UVI image in Figure 11a, both in overall\ndistribution in longitude and in order of magnitude. As\nexpected, the simulated precipitating electron energy flux\nfails to reproduce some of the high-latitude intensifications\nobserved in the UVI images, presumably because our model\npresently does not account for field-aligned acceleration of\nparticles associated with discrete aurora arcs. The longitu-\ndinal distributions of simulated (Figure 11d) and observed\n(Figure 11c) X-ray intensity agree fairly well. The region of\nPIXIE X-ray intensity >1110 cm\u00022 s\u00021 sr\u00021 extends from\nroughly 2000 MLT through midnight to 0600 MLT, whereas\nthe simulated X-ray intensity >1110 cm\u00022 s\u00021 sr\u00021 extends\nfrom roughly 2000 MLT through midnight to about\n1100 MLT. Moreover, the latitudinal distribution of X-ray\nintensity seen by PIXIE is similar to the latitudinal distribu-\ntion of energy flux inferred from UVI. Our simulations can\nreproduce part of the latitudinal distribution of the observed\nX-ray brightness. The regions of simulated and observed\nX-ray intensities >1110 cm\u00022 s\u00021 sr\u00021 extends from 70\u0002 to\n60\u0002 latitude between midnight and dawn. However, the\nregion of simulated X-ray intensity >1100 cm\u00022 s\u00021 sr\u00021\ndoes not reach to as low a latitude (\u000150\u0002 latitude near\n\u00010400 MLT) as in the PIXIE image. This may be because\nthe AMIE electric field underestimates the storm time electric\nfield intensity at low latitudes at this time. A stronger electric\nfield at low latitudes could lead to transport of the plasma\nsheet electrons to lower latitudes. Moreover, the simulated\nX-ray intensity attains a higher maximum value than what is\nobserved. Overall, there is good agreement between the\nsimulated energy flux and that inferred from UVI measure-\nments but only fair agreement between the simulated and\nPIXIE X-ray intensities in Figure 11.\n[42] Finally, Figure 12 corresponds to 1130 UT on 19\nOctober 1998. For this case the latitudinal distributions of\nsimulated precipitating electron energy flux and X-ray\nintensity agree fairly well with the corresponding UVI-\ninferred electron energy flux and PIXIE measured X-ray\nintensity. The UVI-inferred electron energy flux peaks near\nFigure 11. (a) Image of the UVI electron energy flux at 1028 UT. (b) Simulated electron energy flux at\n1030 UT on 19 October 1998.

Again, the simulations do not reproduce inten-\nsification in the UVI-inferred electron energy flux seen at\nhigh latitudes in the premidnight sector (probably associated\nwith discrete auroral arcs). The PIXIE region X-ray inten-\nsity >1100 cm\u00022 s\u00021 sr\u00021 extends to lower latitudes at dawn\n(\u000153\u0002) than at dusk (\u000160\u0002). This is as expected since\nelectrons are transported to lower L values as they drift\neastward toward dawn from the nightside plasma sheet. The\nsimulated X-ray intensity distributions show a similar trend.\nAt dawn, however, the simulated >1110 cm\u00022 s\u00021 sr\u00021\nX-ray intensity extends only to \u000161\u0002 latitude (not as low as\nthe PIXIE observations show). Nevertheless, the similarity\nin the azimuthal distribution of the observed and simulated\nX-ray intensity and precipitating energy flux for this exam-\nple is encouraging. From this numerical experiment, we\nhave postulated the MLT dependence of the scattering rate\nthat wave scattering is weak in the post dusk sector\n(minimum at 2200 MLT) and strong in the morning sector\n(maximum at 0400 MLT). Both storm time (J. L. Roeder,\nprivate communication, 2004) and statistical [Koons and\nRoeder, 1990] analyses of SCATHAwave data indicate that\nthe observed wave activity is strongest in the morning sector\nand weakest in the postdusk sector.\n4. Summary and Conclusions\n[43] In this study we have compared simulated and\nmeasured distributions of precipitating diffuse auroral elec-\ntron energy flux and emitted X-ray brightness for the 19\nOctober 1998 storm. Distributions of the simulated electron\nenergy flux and X-ray intensity have been computed from\nphase-space mapping simulations of plasma sheet electrons\nwith two scattering models: (1) strong diffusion and\n(2) MLT-dependent diffusion that is less than everywhere\nstrong. We have compared the simulated electron energy\nflux distributions using these two different scattering mod-\nels with statistically averaged NOAA-12 precipitating elec-\ntron data (for Dst = \u000280 nT to \u0002110 nT) and Polar\/UVI\nimages, and the simulated X-ray intensity distributions with\nPolar\/PIXIE images. The distributions of precipitating elec-\ntrons during magnetic storms depend on variations of the\nsource distribution (i.e., magnetotail electron fluxes), elec-\ntron transport, and electron pitch-angle scattering. All these\nFigure 12. (a) Image of the UVI electron energy flux at 1133 UT. (b) Simulated X-ray intensity at\n1130 UT on 19 October 1998.

The variations in source distribution,\nthat is, the magnetotail electron fluxes, during storms\ncertainly place an upper limit on how much precipitating\nelectron energy flux would be available during the storm.\nThe convection electric field enhances the inward transport\nof electrons during storms. However, the comparisons of\nsimulated and observed distributions presented in this paper\nshow that electron pitch-angle scattering clearly plays a\ncrucial role in determining the spatial distribution of the\nprecipitating electron energy flux.\n[44] Comparisons of the simulated storm time energy\nflux under strong diffusion (model 1) with average\nNOAA-12 precipitating electron energy flux reveals that\nthe simulated storm time energy flux with strong diffu-\nsion tends to be much more intense in the evening sector\nand much weaker near dawn than what is statistically\nobserved. Our simulations show that the most intense\nelectron precipitation under strong diffusion will occur\nwhere the electron drift times from the plasma sheet are\non the order of the electron lifetime against strong\ndiffusion. On the other hand, comparisons of simulated\ndistributions of the precipitating electron energy flux with\na postulated MLT-dependent diffusion that is less than\neverywhere strong (model 2) with the average NOAA-12\ndata and Polar\/UVI images shows that that this scattering\nmodel produces a more realistic diffuse aurora than with\nstrong diffusion (model 1). Comparisons of simulated\ndistributions of the X-ray flux with those obtained by\nPolar\/PIXIE images also show better agreement with\nscattering model 2 rather than model 1. Our numerical\nexperiment strongly suggests that wave scattering is weak\nin the post dusk sector (minimum at 2200 MLT) and\nstrong in the morning sector (maximum at 0400 MLT).\nBoth storm time (J. Roeder, private communication,\n2004) and statistical [Koons and Roeder, 1990] analyses\nof SCATHA wave data indicate that the observed wave\nactivity is indeed strongest in the morning sector and\nweakest in the post dusk sector. With scattering model 2,\nthe precipitating electron energy flux and X-ray intensity\ntends to be higher in the morning sector than in the\nevening sector because the lifetimes against pitch-angle\nscattering tend to be shorter in the morning sector than in\nthe evening sector.\n[45] The fairly good agreement between our simulation\nresults and the observations are encouraging. However,\nthe MLT-dependent scattering model presented here is\nonly an approximation of what is actually occurring.\nCertainly the pitch-angle scattering depends not only on\nMLAT and MLT but also is time dependent. We plan to\nimprove upon our scattering rate models as more relevant\nwave and particle observations are analyzed. For example,\nHorne and Thorne [2000] have recently calculated pitch-\nangle diffusion rates for electron cyclotron harmonic\n(ECH) and whistler mode waves in the equatorial region\nby using parameters that are representative of CRRES\nwave observations of Meredith et al. [1999]. We will\nfurther improve upon our scattering rate model by incor-\nporating results from similar future calculations (e.g.,\nR. M. Thorne, personal communication, 2003) of pitch\nangle diffusion rates for a wider range of plasma param-\neters and L values. Recent statistical and storm time\nanalyses of amplitudes of ECH and whistler mode chorus\nobserved by SCATHA (J. Roeder, private communication,\n2004) will also aid us in this endeavor.\n[46] Acknowledgments. The authors thank D. L.
