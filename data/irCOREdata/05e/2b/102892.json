However, we present results from recent microstructural investigations of carbonaceous\ndust particles from a methane precursor that demonstrate that the technique may be suited to\ngenerating fullerene molecules, nanotubes, and nanoparticles. Chemical analysis reveals that these\nparticles contain few contaminant species, and we deduce that they nucleated in the plasma, with the\ncarbon ions possibly self-arranging through the action of coulombic forces. \u00a9 1998 American\nInstitute of Physics. @S0003-6951~98!03747-4#Fullerenes were discovered in an attempt to recreate the\nconditions believed to exist in interstellar clouds, which arise\nfrom the cosmological phenomenon of \u2018\u2018dusty plasmas.\u2019\u20191\nThe many potential uses of fullerenes and nanotubes for na-\nnoengineered materials include a possible electronic super\/\nsemiconductor, self-aligned electron field emission tips,2\ncatalyst cradles for highly selective chemical reactions,3 and\na transport medium for medical drug delivery. Hence, re-\nsearch into this form of carbon is of utmost scientific and\nindustrial interest, with relatively large quantities of\nfullerenes and related material being produced commercially\nby using the carbon-arc discharge process4 which requires\nextraction and purification.5 In addition, the carbon arc is not\nparticularly efficient nor controllable, with the conditions\nwithin the chamber varying dramatically between the dis-\ncharge region and the outer walls. This is problematic if a\ncost-effective and industrially scaleable process is to be de-\nveloped.\nDusty plasmas have also been studied by researchers in-\nvolved with plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition\n~PECVD! of amorphous hydrogenated silicon ~a-Si:H! thin\nfilms.6 When silane, for example, is used to produce large\nareas of a-Si:H for solar cells and thin-film semiconducting\ndevices, small particles nucleate within the plasma and create\nlocal instabilities and power fluctuations.7 These cause non-\nuniformity in the deposited films, and in extreme cases lead\nto unacceptable contamination rendering the material unus-\nable for electronic applications.8 This has led to a number of\npublications focused on understanding the formation, dy-\nnamics, and consequences of these terrestrial dusty plasmas,\nwith regard to silicon-based PECVD dust.9 However, the de-\nvelopment of amorphous hydrogenated carbon ~a-C:H!10 de-\nvices formed from a methane precursor, for example, is still\nvery much in its infancy, and little attention has so far been\npaid to the nature of carbonaceous dusty plasmas.\nThe a-C:H films routinely grown by PECVD are of in-\nterest for field emission cold cathodes11 and tunable wide\nband-gap semiconductors.12 Unlike silicon, it is carbon\u2019s\na!Author to whom correspondence should be addressed.

Similarly,\nthe PECVD generated carbonaceous dust also exhibits a\nwide variety of structures that may be of significant interest\nto the fullerene community based on a cheaper and more\nwidely available technology.\nAn industrial standard Plasma Technology DP800 radio\nfrequency PECVD system was operated at 200 W with a 250\nmTorr process pressure of methane gas maintained by a flow\nrate of 30 sccm. The chamber and electrodes were water\ncooled with the substrate table temperature maintained below\n50 \u00b0C while the deposition ran continuously for 1 h. After\ncompletion, ;10 g of brown colored dust was collected from\nthe floor adjacent to the chamber wall. A small quantity of\nthis was ultrasonically dispersed in toluene and then spread\non a holey carbon support film of a gold electron microscopy\nfinder grid. The morphology and microstructure of the par-\nticles were analyzed using a JEOL 4000 EX~II! high resolu-\ntion transmission electron microscope ~HRTEM! operated at\n400 kV with a LaB6 filament. High resolution images were\nobtained at Scherzer defocus with a point-to-point resolution\nbetter than 1.7 \u00c5. The chemical content of the identified\nparticles was investigated using a 200 kV JEOL 2010 HR-\nTEM equipped with nanoprobe capabilities and a light-\nelement energy dispersive x-ray ~EDX! detector.\nApproximately 5% of the dispersed particles and ag-\nglomerates captured on the grid were found to consist of\ncompact aggregates containing graphitic crystallites. These\nappeared to be very similar to the material reportedly ob-\ntained by arc-discharge evaporation of graphite electrodes,13\nand EDX analysis confirmed that they were predominantly\ncarbonaceous. Such aggregates were typically 1 to 2 mm\nacross consisting typically of the order of a thousand nano-\nparticles; a general view and example of which we have\npublished previously.14 Incorporated in such aggregates were\nnanotubes varying in length from 100 to 300 nm with diam-\neters in the range of 10\u201330 nm and internal tube diameters of\n2\u20135 nm, leading to walls consisting of 5\u201330 graphene layers.\nA striking example of a well developed carbon nanotube\nfound in our sample is shown in Fig. 1.

There is also an\namorphous surface region of 2 to 3 monolayers which is not\nan uncommon feature of these materials.16\nIt should be noted that these structures have been formed\nin a much less energetic process when compared to the arc-\ndischarge process. Preliminary measurements using an elec-\ntrostatic probe equipped with a compensating electrode have\nshown that in the conditions described, the electron tempera-\nture in the plasma was ;2.4 eV. Further work is now being\nperformed to characterize the plasma more fully and monitor\nchanges that occur as particles nucleate within it.\nA graphitic region of an aggregate with well developed\nand angular nanoparticles is illustrated in Fig. 2. The arrow\nindicates a circular fringe of ;10 \u00c5 in diameter believed to\nbe a single fullerene molecule.

An area of carbonaceous nanoparticles with a single C60 fullerene\nindicated by the arrow. This is believed to be the first occasion that visual\nevidence has been published showing that fullerene molecules can be gen-\nerated at room temperature in a PECVD system using methane as the pre-\ncursor gas. Although close examination of the fringes suggests that the\nelectron beam was causing some damage to the molecule at the time of\nphotographic exposure, its apparent mobility as a circular entity confirmed it\nwas a discrete fullerene.

We therefore believe that\nthis molecule had been created during the PECVD deposi-\ntion of the dust, and is the first visual evidence that we are\naware of that confirms that fullerenes can be produced by\nthis low-temperature method using a gaseous source of car-\nbon, namely methane.\nThe fringes that we believe are behind the indicated\nfullerene in Fig. 2 form part of a large nanoparticle with\ncurved \u2018\u2018onion-like\u2019\u2019 corners and a high degree of order in\nthe concentric graphene layers. Figure 3 illustrates another\nstriking example of a nanoparticle containing highly curved\nand nested graphene layers. The high contrast in this photo-\nmicrograph suggests that the graphene layers extend perpen-\ndicular into the plane of the paper, and that the curvature\nmay be more akin to that of a rolled-up carpet than that of\nthe nanotube seen in Fig. 1. Hence, the conditions present\nduring PECVD must have enabled graphene layers to both\nnucleate and then grow to a significant extent.\nWe hypothesize that these particles nucleated within the\nplasma, rather than on the electrodes, and that the carbon\nions were forced into a hexagonal arrangement by coulombic\nforces which have been reported to account for macroscopic\npseudocrystals generated in a similar plasma environment.18\nBeing on a significantly smaller scale, this could accommo-\ndate the trigonal bonding that leads to the observed graphene\nlayers. The net flow of gas to the cooler plasma edge would\neventually allow the carbon aggregates to condense and form\ntheir final arrangement of nanotubes and nanoparticles. Fur-\nther evidence that these particles nucleated in the plasma\nphase rather than on the electrodes of the system is provided\nby the observation of totally amorphous films grown on sub-\nstrates placed on either electrode under these conditions.\nMany particles were also found on the grid that con-\nsisted of curled amorphous fragments believed to be rem-\nnants of stress-relieved a-C:H film originally deposited on\nthe upper driven electrode. These are thought to have spalled\nfrom the electrode, fallen into the plasma, and remained elec-\ntrostatically levitated while being carried with the gas flow to\nthe edge of the system. Eventually, away from the plasma\nFIG. 3. A further striking example of fullerene-related material seen in the\ncarbonaceous dust.

Silva\nDownand under the influence of gravity and vortices from the gas\nflow, these particles fell to the chamber floor. These particles\nand flakes were totally amorphous in nature. It should be\nappreciated that the microscopy grids would probably be\nmore efficient in the capture of these larger fragments than\nthe compact fullerene-like aggregates and therefore a higher\nvolume fraction of the latter could be expected.\nBy configuring a PECVD system for optimum dust gen-\neration in the plasma rather than by material spalling from\nthe electrodes, it should be possible to develop an inexpen-\nsive, controlled, and reproducible technique to continuously\nproduce large quantities of fullerene containing material.\nWith further work, it may be feasible to improve the yield of\none particular species, thereby removing the need for a sec-\nondary purification process. The findings we report in this\ninitial investigation suggest that fullerene science and dusty\nplasmas have come full circle, and that the PECVD gener-\nated carbonaceous dust is itself technologically important\nand not just an inconvenient by-product of semiconductor\nthin-film processing.\nThis work is funded by the Engineering and Physical\nScience Research Council ~GR\/L09202!, and the authors\nthank Dr. J.
