Introduction\n[2] Magmas typically contain appreciable amounts of\ngas in the form of bubbles. Gas volume-fractions f can\nvary over an enormous range from 0 to > 0.9. The\nrheology of pure silicate melts is comparatively well-\nknown and is Newtonian to a close approximation for a\nwide range of conditions. By contrast, the rheological\neffect of adding bubbles to such a liquid has remained\ncontroversial for many years with some authors observing\nan increase in viscosity with increasing f [Sibree, 1934;\nStein and Spera, 1992] and others a decrease [Sura and\nPanda, 1990; Bagdassarov and Dingwell, 1992, 1993;\nLejeune et al., 1999]. A resolution to this apparent\ncontradiction has recently been proposed by Rust and\nManga [2002], Stein and Spera [2002] and Llewellin et\nal. [2002].\n[3] Rust and Manga [2002] observed the viscosity as a\nfunction of capillary number Ca in steady, simple-shearing\nflows. Ca is a measure of the equilibrium deformation of the\nbubbles and is given by Ca = h0a _g=\u0002 where h0 is the\nviscosity of the liquid phase, a is the radius of the relaxed,\nundeformed bubble, \u0002 is the surface tension, and _g is the\nstrain rate. Both Rust and Manga [2002] and Stein and\nSpera [2002] identify two flow regimes: at low Ca, the\nviscosity is seen to increase with f whereas, at high Ca, the\nviscosity decreases as f increases. The two regimes can be\nexplained as follows: Bubbles distort the flow lines in the\nsurrounding liquid causing an increase in viscosity. Bubbles\nalso provide free-slip surfaces within the suspension,\ndecreasing its viscosity. At low Ca, the bubbles remain\napproximately spherical so the distortion of the flow lines is\ngreat and the free-slip surface-area is small, hence viscosity\nis an increasing function of f. At high Ca, the bubbles are\nsignificantly elongate so the free-slip surface-area is large\nand the distortion of the flow lines is small, hence viscosity\nis a decreasing function of f.\n[4] The importance of distinguishing between steady and\nunsteady flows is highlighted by Llewellin et al. [2002]. In a\nsteady flow, shear conditions have remained constant for a\ntime significantly longer than the relaxation time of the\nbubbles, l \u00bc k h0a=\u0002, where k is a dimensionless number\nthat is a positive function of gas volume-fraction (k \u0002 1 in\nthe dilute limit). There are many magmatic flows which will\nnever reach such a steady-state condition. This is especially\ntrue for explosive flows (below the fragmentation level) in\nwhich fluid particles experience enormous accelerations (in\nwhich case the Lagrangian _g is not steady) and for high-\nviscosity flows (e.g. for h0 = 10\n9 Pa s, a = 1 mm, \u0002 = 0.3 N\nm\u00041 and k = 1, l \u0002 3000s). In Llewellin et al. [2002] we\ninvestigated the effect of unsteadiness on the rheology of a\nbubbly flow. This necessarily includes a consideration of\nthe viscoelastic properties of the two-phase mixture. We\ndescribed the steadiness of the flow using a dimensionless\nnumber, the dynamic capillary number Cd = l \u0003g= _g which\ngives the ratio of the bubble relaxation time (l) to the\ntimescale over which the strain rate changes appreciably\n( _g=\u0003g). When Cd \u0005 1 relaxation is rapid compared to the\ntimescale of appreciable change in strain rate, hence the\nflow is approximately steady and the viscosity of the two-\nphase mixture can either increase or decrease with f\ndepending on the bubble shape as in the case of steady-\nflow conditions. By contrast, when Cd \u0006 1, the bubbles\ncannot relax fast enough to reach their equilibrium defor-\nmation. They deform with the flow to a greater extent so\nflow past the bubble and, therefore, flow-line distortion, is\nreduced. The free-slip surfaces are more important, causing\na reduction in the suspension, therefore, viscosity as f\nincreases.\n[5] If the results of Rust and Manga [2002] and Llewellin\net al. [2002] are combined then we conclude that the\nviscosity will decrease as f increases except when both\nCa < O(1) and Cd < O(1).\n[6] Below we present a generalized equation that is valid\nfor varying Ca and Cd so that no assumptions need be made\nGEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS, VOL. 29, NO. 24, 2170, doi:10.1029\/2002GL015697, 2002\n1Department of Earth Sciences, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.\n2Department of Mathematics, University of Manchester, Manchester,\nUK.\nCopyright 2002 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0094-8276\/02\/2002GL015697$05.00\n23 - 1\nCorrection published 28 March 2003\na priori about the steadiness of the flow or the bubble\nshape.\n2. General Constitutive Equation\n[7] A constitutive equation for a bubbly liquid valid up to\nat least Cd = 10, Ca\u0005 1 and f ~< 0.5 is given in Llewellin et\nal. [2002]:\ntij \u00fe 6l\n5\n_tij \u00bc h0\u00f01\u00fe bf\u00de _gij \u00fe h0\n6l\n5\n1\u0004 5f\n3\n\u0001 \u0002\n\u0003gij \u00f01\u00de\nwhere tij is the deviatoric-stress tensor (Tij = \u0004Pdij + tij\nwhere Tij is the total-stress tensor, P is the pressure and dij is\nthe Kronecker delta), h0 is the viscosity of the liquid phase, f\nis the gas volume-fraction and b is an empirically-\ndetermined parameter. This model is based on the physical\nanalysis of Frankel and Acrivos [1970] which was simplified\nby assuming small total-strains (Ca \u0005 1). Llewellin et al.\n[2002] parameterize the resultant model according to data\ncollected from oscillatory rheometric measurements of\naerated golden syrup and find b = 9.\n[8] In order to generalize this constitutive model to\ninclude arbitrarily large strains, the simple time derivatives\nin equation 1 have to be changed back to the co-rotational\nor Jaumann derivatives of the unsimplified Frankel and\nAcrivos [1970] model. The Jaumann derivative for an\narbitrary tensor Aij is given by:\nA\u02daij \u00bc @Aij\n@t\n\u00fe uk @Aij\n@xk\n\u00fevikAkj \u0004 Aikvkj \u00f02\u00de\nwhere ui is the velocity vector and vij is the vorticity tensor\n[Barthe\u00b4s-Biesel and Acrivos, 1973]. Thus, a Jaumann\nderivative includes advective (2nd term on r.h.s.) and\nvorticity terms (3th and 4th terms on r.h.s.).\n[9] The Jaumann derivative appears commonly in ana-\nlytical studies that derive general constitutive (i.e. stress-\nstrain) relations for complex materials from first principles\n[see, e.g. Rivlin and Erickson, 1955; Oldroyd, 1950;\nBarthe\u00b4s-Biesel and Acrivos, 1973]. The only assumption\nthat enters into these studies is that the length scale of the\nmotion is much larger than the dimensions of the particles.\nThe suspension can then be treated as a continuum with bulk\nproperties that are ensemble averages of the corresponding\nlocal quantities. The detailed flow-field around each particle\nis obtained analytically and is used to derive, without any\nfurther assumptions, an exact analytical rheological equation\nof state, which contains no empirically adjustable parame-\nters and in which the functional relation between the stress\nand all the relevant physical quantities is shown explicitly.\n[10] If the Jaumann derivatives and the non-linear terms\nare reinstated in our constitutive equation 1, then it becomes\n[Rivlin and Erickson, 1955; Frankel and Acrivos, 1970;\nBarthe\u00b4s-Biesel and Acrivos, 1973]:\ntij \u00fe l1t\u02daij \u00bc 2h0 aeij \u00fe l2e\u02daij \u00fe l3\u2018d eikekj\n\u0003 \u0004\u0005 \u0006 \u00f03\u00de\nwhere the Jaumann derivative is denoted by the ring\noperator, eij is the rate-of-strain tensor \u00f0eij \u00bc _gij=2\u00de and:\nl1 \u00bc 6l\n5\na \u00bc 1\u00fe bf \u00f04\u00de\nl2 \u00bc 1\u0004 5f\n3\n\u0001 \u0002\nl1 l3 \u00bc 4l1f\n7\n\u00f05\u00de\nand the operator \u2018d denotes the symmetric, traceless part\n(e.g., \u2018d\u00bdAij\u000b \u00bc 12 \u00f0Aij \u00fe Aji\u00de \u0004 13Alldij). Note that eij and vij\nare the symmetric and anti-symmetric components of the\nvelocity gradient tensor @uj \/@xi.\n[11] Equation 3 is based on the analysis of Frankel and\nAcrivos [1970] and so, strictly speaking, is only valid for\nlarge material strains as long as the bubble deformation is\nsmall (bubbles remain approximately spherical) and the\nflow is only weakly time-dependent. However, Llewellin\net al. [2002] find that the model provides a good fit to their\ndata, even in the unsteady limit where Cd \u0002 O(10) and the\nmodel is consistent with the data presented in Stein and\nSpera [2002] up to at least Ca \u0002 1000.\n2.1. Simple Shearing Flow\n[12] In certain simple cases, equation 3 can be solved\nanalytically. One such case is that of simple shearing flow\nfor which the velocity is given by u = (u1(x2),0,0).\n[13] In this case, if S = du1\/dx2 then the relationship\nbetween deviatoric stress and strain is given by:\nt11 t12 0\nt12 t22 0\n0 0 t33\n0\n@\n1\nA\u00fe l1S \u0004t12\n1\n2\n\u00f0t11 \u0004 t22\u00de 0\n1\n2\n\u00f0t11 \u0004 t22\u00de t12 0\n0 0 0\n0\n@\n1\nA\n\u00bc 2h0 a\n0 S\n2\n0\nS\n2\n0 0\n0 0 0\n0\n@\n1\nA\u00fel2\n\u0004S2\n2\n0 0\n0 S\n2\n2\n0\n0 0 0\n0\n@\n1\nA\u00fe l3\nS2\n12\n0 0\n0 S\n2\n12\n0\n0 0 \u0004S\n2\n6\n0\nB@\n1\nCA\n2\n64\n3\n75\n\u00f06\u00de\nComparing terms leads to the following set of equations:\nt11 \u0004 l1St12 \u00bc h0S2\nl3\n6\n\u0004 l2\n\u0001 \u0002\n\u00f07\u00de\nt22 \u00fe l1St12 \u00bc h0S2 l2 \u00fe\nl3\n6\n\u0001 \u0002\n\u00f08\u00de\nt33 \u00bc \u0004h0l3S\n2\n3\n\u00f09\u00de\nt12 \u00fe l1S\n2\n\u00f0t11 \u0004 t22\u00de \u00bc h0aS \u00f010\u00de\nFrom equations 7, 8, and 10 and using the result that the\nviscosity is given by h = t12\/S, the relative viscosity hr = h\/\nh0 is given by:\nhr \u00bc\na\u00fe l1l2S2\n1\u00fe l21S2\n\u00bc 1\u0004 5f\n3\n\u00fe \u00f075b\u00fe 125\u00def\n75\u00fe 108Ca2 \u00f011\u00de\nwhere Ca = lS, b = 9. Hence the material is shear thinning:\nhr \u00bc 1\u00fe bf : Ca\u0005 11\u0004 5f=3 : Ca\u0006 1:\n\u0013\n\u00f012\u00de\nThe solid line in Figure 1 shows how hr varies with Ca for a\nbubbly liquid. The normal-stress differences N1 = t11 \u0004 t22\nand N2 = t22 \u0004 t33 can be calculated readily from equations\n7\u201310. They are generally non-zero and N1 > t12 for\nintermediate Ca. Spera et al. [1988] present a value of\nthe first normal-stress coefficient (which is given by y1 =\n23 - 2 LLEWELLIN ET AL.: THE CONSTITUTIVE EQUATION FOR BUBBLY MAGMAS\n\u0004N1\/ _g2) of y1 = \u00042.53 \f 103 Pa s2 based on rod-climbing\nexperiments with bubbly rhyolites. For the appropriate\nmaterial properties and strain rate, our analysis predicts y1 =\n\u00042.49 \f 103 Pa s2, which is in excellent agreement.\n2.2. Unsteady Flow\n[14] Equation 3 is also soluble for the case of oscillatory\nflow, e.g. in a concentric cylinder viscometer where the\nimposed torque varies sinusoidally. Small strains are\nassumed, equivalent to, for example, start-up flow in a\nvolcanic conduit where Cd is, necessarily, large (since _g =\n0 initially) and strains are small.\n[15] For a viscoelastic material undergoing oscillatory\nflow with angular frequency w, the viscosity has a viscous\ncomponent, h0 and an elastic component h00 [see Llewellin et\nal., 2002 - Appendix A]:\nh0 \u00bc h0\na\u00fe l1l2w2\n1\u00fe l21w2\n\u00bc h0 1\u0004\n5f\n3\n\u00fe \u00f075b\u00fe 125\u00def\n75\u00fe 108Cd2\n\u0001 \u0002\n\u00f013\u00de\nh00 \u00bc h0\n\u00f0l1a\u0004 l2\u00dew\n1\u00fe l21w2\n\u00bc h0\n\u00f030b\u00fe 50\u00defCd\n25\u00fe 36Cd2 \u00f014\u00de\nwhere Cd = lw, b = 9. The complex viscosity h* = h0 \u2013 ih00\nhence the relative viscosity is given by:\nhr \u00bc\njh*j\nh0\n\u00bc 1\n3\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n9\u0004 30f\u00fe 25f2 \u00fe \u00f0450b\u00fe 750\u00def\u00fe \u00f0225b\n2 \u0004 625\u00def2\n25\u00fe 36Cd2\ns\n\u00f015\u00de\nHence the viscosity decreases as the flow becomes\nincreasingly unsteady:\nhr \u00bc 1\u00fe bf : Ca \u0005 11\u0004 5f=3 : Ca\u0006 1:\n\u0013\n\u00f016\u00de\nThis is the same as equation 12 for steady flow with Cd\nsubstituted for Ca. The dashed line in Figure 1 shows how hr\nvaries with Cd for an unsteady flow. The relationship is\nalmost identical to that of hr = f (Ca) for steady-flow\nconditions (solid line in Figure 1), with only a little deviation\nwhen Ca = Cd \u0002 1. If Ca and Cd are small, hr = 1 + bf. If\neither Ca or Cd are large, hr = 1 \u0004 5f\/3.\n3. Flow Along A Circular Pipe\n[16] The special case of flow along a circular pipe is of\ninterest to volcanologists as a model for flow of magma in a\nvolcanic conduit. The analysis for Poiseuille flow in a\ncircular pipe is identical to that for simple shearing flow\ndescribed in section 2.1 with directions 1, 2 and 3 replaced by\ncylindrical coordinate components z, r and q respectively (u =\n(uz(r),0,0)) and the velocity profile and flow rate of a bubbly\nfluid along a pipe can be calculated for given physical\nparameters. The z-component of the equation of motion for\na fluid undergoing simple shearing flow along a pipe is:\n0 \u00bc \u0004P0 \u0004 1\nr\nd\ndr\n\u00f0rtrz\u00de \u00f017\u00de\nwhere P0 is the pressure gradient above hydrostatic (so, in a\nvolcanic conduit, P0 = d(Plithostatic \u2013 Pmagmastatic)\/dz).\nIntegration of equation 17 and substitution for trz (from\nequations 7, 8, and 10) gives)\nh0S\na\u00fe l1l2S2\n1\u00fe l21S2\n\u00bc P\n0r\n2\n\u00f018\u00de\nThis allows S(r) to be calculated as the root of a cubic\nequation. Since S = duz\/dr:\nuz\u00f0r\u00de \u00bc\nZ 0\nR\nS\u00f0r\u00dedr \u00f019\u00de\nwhere R is the radius of the pipe and subject to the no-slip\nboundary-condition uz(R) = 0. Numerical solution of\nequation 19 allows the velocity profile uz(r) to be\ndetermined for any given values of h0, P\n0, R and l.\n[17] Using Poiseuille\u2019s equation a relative effective New-\ntonian viscosity can be defined for a bubbly flow.\nheff \u00bc\npP0R4\n8Qh0\n\u00f020\u00de\nThis is the viscosity of the Newtonian fluid which has the\nsame volume flow-rate as the bubbly fluid for the given\nFigure 1. Relative viscosity against capillary number (Ca:\nsteady, Cd: unsteady) for f = 0.15.\nFigure 2. Velocity profile for a Newtonian material (solid\nline) and a bubbly fluid (dashed line). Profiles for bubbly\nfluid are shown at low, intermediate and high values of Cc.\nLLEWELLIN ET AL.: THE CONSTITUTIVE EQUATION FOR BUBBLY MAGMAS 23 - 3\nflow parameters normalized with respect to h0. Q is the\nvolume flow-rate and is given by:\nQ \u00bc 2p\nZ 0\nR\nruz\u00f0r\u00dedr \u00f021\u00de\n[18] Figure 2 shows the velocity profile across a conduit\nfor a fluid with f = 0.3. All velocities are normalized to the\naxial velocity for the bubble-free flow (which has a New-\ntonian rheology and a parabolic velocity-profile which is\nshown for comparison). The velocity profile for the bubbly\nflow is not constant, but varies as the physical parameters P0,\nR, l and h0 are varied. We define a dimensionless combi-\nnation of these parameters, the conduit capillary number Cc,\nwith which we can describe the flow.\nCc \u00bc P\n0Rl\nh0\n\u00f022\u00de\nAt low Cc the material has an almost parabolic velocity\nprofile indicating Newtonian rheology. The velocity of the\nflow is considerably lower than the bubble-free flow\nindicating that its effective viscosity is higher. For low\nCc, heff = 1 + bf. At high Cc the velocity profile is again\nparabolic and heff = 1 \u0004 5f\/3.\n[19] At intermediate values of Cc the fluid shows two\nregimes of flow: an inner plug where strain rates are low\n(heff = 1 + bf) and an outer sleeve where strain rates are\nhigh (heff =1 \u0004 5f\/3). The volume flow-rate Q for Cc =\n4.842 is the same as for the bubble-free flow and the\ncorresponding velocity profile is shown for comparison in\nFigure 2.\n[20] Figure 3 shows how the relative viscosity heff of the\nmaterial varies with Cc for bubbly flows with a range of gas\nvolume-fractions. The transition from heff =1 + bf to heff =\n1 \u0004 5f\/3 occurs at Cc \u0002 4 which is in the mid-range for\nvolcanic eruptions.\n[21] The presence of a relatively-undeformed plug of\nmaterial surrounded by a rapidly-deforming sleeve has\nmany implications for physical volcanology. A study of\nemulsions in pipe flow by Grizutti and Bifulco [1997]\nsuggests that low strain-rates, such as those found in the\nplug-flow region, promote the coalescence of bubbles\nwhich may promote magma fragmentation in the plug.\n\u2018Tube\u2019 pumices with highly-elongate vesicles frequently\nappear together with pumices containing spherical vesicles\n[Marti et al., 1999]. This would be expected if fragmenta-\ntion occurred in an intermediate-Cc flow where a magma\nplug bearing spherical bubbles coexists with a region of\nhighly-elongate bubbles.\n[22] Calculating Cc for a volcanic eruption in which\nsteady-flow conditions have been reached provides a simple\nway to calculate the effect of bubbles on the velocity profile\nacross the conduit and the effective viscosity of the magma.\n[23] Acknowledgments.
