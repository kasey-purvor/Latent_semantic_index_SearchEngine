Introduction \nStudying the linkages between financial development and growth is a popular topic both in \ntheoretical and empirical macroeconomics. According to Levine (2005), financial systems \nfoster growth as they produce ex ante information about possible investment; monitor \ninvestment and exert corporate governance after providing finance; facilitate the trading, \ndiversification, and management of risk; mobilize and pool savings; and ease the exchange of \ngoods and services. As early as 1969, Goldsmith (1969) provided the first cross-country \nempirical study documenting the existence of a strong positive link between the functioning \nof the financial system and growth. A number of studies followed, generally confirming the \nexistence of this link (see Levine, 2005, for a survey). The majority of these studies are based \non cross-country macro data, but cross-country industry-level and firm-level data have also \nbeen used. For instance, Rajan and Zingales (1998) find that in countries with better \nfunctioning financial systems, industries that are naturally heavy users of external finance \ngrow faster than industries that are not, and Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt and Maksimovic (1998) show \nthat in these same countries, a larger proportion of firms grows at rates that cannot be self-\nfinanced, but require access to external financing. \n Yet, cross-country economic growth regressions are likely to suffer from data \ncompatibility problems, as country officials may define, collect, and measure variables \ninconsistently across countries (Levine and Zarvos, 1996). Using cross-regional data within a \nsingle country instead of cross-country data makes these problems less severe, and represents \na promising alternative route for examining the impact of finance on growth1. Our paper \nfollows this route: we analyze the links between finance and growth in 30 Chinese provinces, \nover the period 1989-2003.  \nChina represents an interesting case study for two reasons. First, considering that \nBekaert et al. (2006) find that China\u2019s extraordinary growth cannot be fully explained using \nstandard growth regressions, understanding its determinants remains an open question. \nSecond, Allen et al. (2005) characterize China as a counterexample to the findings of the \nfinance-growth literature, as in spite of a malfunctioning financial system, it has one of the \n                                                 \n1 Very few studies have followed this route. For instance, Jayaratne and Strahan (1996) and Dehejia and Lleras-\nMuney (2003) study the impact of finance on economic growth by examining individual states in the USA. \nSimilarly, Guiso et al. (2002) analyze the effects of financial development on growth across individual regions in \nItaly. \n 3\nfastest growing economies2. The Chinese case suggests therefore that there might be \ncircumstances under which financial distortions do not represent an impediment to growth.  \nExisting research on the links between finance and growth in China has led to \ncontrasting results: some authors documented a positive relationship; others, a negative one; \nand others, no relationship at all. Our analysis extends the literature in several dimensions. \nFirst, we use a wide range of financial indicators, including traditionally used indicators of \nfinancial intermediary development (ratio of bank loans, total loans, or total household saving \ndeposits in the banking system over GDP); China-specific indicators measuring the level of \nstate interventionism in finance (credit provided by the four main state-owned commercial \nbanks over total credit or GDP; ratio of loans to deposits of the state-owned banks); and \nindicators measuring the degree of market driven financing in the economy (share of fixed \nassets investment financed by domestic loans relative to that financed by state budget \nappropriation; share of investment financed by self-raised funds). Our wide selection of \nindicators allows us to account both for the size and quality effect of financial intermediation. \nSecond, for the first time in the Chinese context, we analyze the links between finance and \ntwo sources of GDP growth, namely physical capital accumulation and total factor \nproductivity (TFP) growth. Third, we investigate whether, as a result of the progressive \nrestructuring of the banking sector in China, the link between finance and growth has changed \nafter 2000. Finally, considering that China is among the top Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) \nrecipients in the world (Prasad and Wei, 2005), we investigate whether the finance-growth \nnexus changes for regions with different FDI to GDP ratios. This exercise is motivated by \nHarrison et al. (2004), who show that firms in countries with greater FDI inflows are less \nlikely to face financial constraints, as incoming foreign investment provides an additional \nsource of capital. It is therefore possible that, in the Chinese case, FDI provides capital to \nfirms which would otherwise be constrained in their growth by the inability to obtain funds, \ndue to distortions in the banking sector3.  \nWe find that traditionally used indicators of financial development and China-specific \nindicators measuring the level of state interventionism in finance are generally negatively \nassociated with growth and its sources, while indicators measuring the degree of market \n                                                 \n2 According to our data, China\u2019s annual growth rate of real GDP has been on average 9.1 percent over the period \n1989-2003. \n3 In line with this idea, Huang (2003) formulates a \u201cdemand perspective\u201d on FDI, which stresses that private \nChinese enterprises may be forced to look for foreign investors as they are constrained in their activity due to \ndiscrimination relative to state-owned enterprises both from the banking system and the equity market. Private \nfirms might therefore use foreign joint-ventures as a way to acquire needed capital in order to undertake \ninvestment. Moreover, as highlighted in Luo (2007), forming joint-ventures with foreign firms may also reduce \nthe level of asymmetric information faced by private firms, leading to easier access to bank finance. \n 4\ndriven financing in the economy tend to promote GDP and TFP growth, as well as capital \naccumulation. These effects have gradually declined over time and tend to be weaker for high \nFDI recipients, suggesting that FDI may be used to alleviate the costs associated with the \ninefficient banking sector. \n The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we briefly describe \nthe Chinese financial system and review the literature on the finance-growth nexus in China. \nSection 3 describes our data set and provides some descriptive statistics. Section 4 illustrates \nour baseline specification and estimation methodology. Section 5 presents our main empirical \nresults. Section 6 investigates how the relationship between growth and our financial \nindicators has evolved over time, and how it depends on the level of FDI received by each \nprovince. Section 7 concludes. \n \n2. Financial system and finance-growth nexus in China \n \n2.1 China\u2019s financial system \nBefore 1978, the Chinese economy was centrally planned and production was exclusively \nconducted by state-owned enterprises. The financial system consisted of a single bank, the \nPeople\u2019s Bank of China (PBC), which served both as a Central Bank and as a commercial \nbank. Yet, the role of the PBC was very limited as most long-term investment financing was \nnot channelled to enterprises through the banking system, but financed with budgetary grants. \nThe PBC only provided working capital to enterprises.  \nIn 1978, the single bank was split. The PBC was left to operate as a Central Bank; and \nthree state-owned banks were created: the Bank of China, the People\u2019s Construction Bank of \nChina, and the Agriculture Bank of China, respectively dealing with foreign currency \ntransactions, investment in manufacturing, and banking in rural areas. A fourth state-owned \nbank was created in 1984, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China. It took over all \ncommercial transactions from the PBC. After 1984, a number of non-state owned banks also \nentered the financial system, including commercial banks, urban and rural credit cooperatives, \ntrust and investment companies, financial companies, and other institutions. Yet, in 1994, the \nstate-owned banks still dominated the financial sector: their total assets covered around 78 \npercent of the total assets of the entire financial sector. Moreover, the banking system was \nplagued by huge amounts of non performing loans (Podpiera, 2006). \n Major banking reforms were initiated in 1994 when the central government decided to \nseparate policy banks from commercial banks, and established three policy-lending banks and \n 5\nfour specialized commercial banks. The banking reforms thereafter include, among others: \ntransforming the urban credit cooperatives into commercial banks (1996-1998); granting \nlimited licenses to some foreign banks; reducing government intervention in credit allocation; \nloosening interest rate controls; recommending standard accounting and prudential norms \n(Shirai, 2002). A further impulse for changes in the banking sector came about with China\u2019s \nentry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001. Progresses include fewer restrictions \non ownership and increased operational freedom. As a consequence of the reforms, by the end \nof 2002, the state-owned banks\u2019 market share had declined to 68 percent, and non performing \nloans had also significantly declined (Podpiera, 2006; Allen et al., 2006). \nDespite the large size of the banking sector in China, until recently, most bank credit \nwas directed to inefficient state enterprises, leaving good private enterprises without access to \nexternal funding. Until 1998, the four state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs, i.e. the Bank of \nChina, China Construction Bank, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, and the \nAgricultural Bank of China) were instructed to lend to state-owned enterprises (SOEs). The \nChinese state enterprises submitted investment plans and funding requests that had to be \napproved at the provincial and central authority level. Based on this, lending quotas were \nissued to enterprises. Since private enterprises were excluded from submitting investment \nplans, they were, naturally, also excluded from lending quotas. In addition, there was also a \nlegal bias against private domestic firms, which made it harder for them to collateralize their \nassets in order to obtain loans, and made it riskier for banks to lend them money (Huang, \n2003). \nThe system was liberalized at the end of 1990s, when the China Constitution \nacknowledged the private sector to be an integral part of the economy, and theoretically it is \nnot in place any more. However, in practice, banks still consider private enterprises to be \nriskier than their public peers either due to their short credit history or lower chance of being \nbailed out by the government. Moreover, as discussed in Park and Sehrt (2001), lending by \nstate banks is still determined by policy reasons, rather than by commercial motives. \n In summary, a major problem in China\u2019s corporate sector is a political pecking order \nof firms which leads to the allocation of China\u2019s financial resources to the least efficient firms \n(state-owned enterprises), while denying the same resources to China\u2019s most efficient firms \n(private enterprises). Although they are the engine of growth in the Chinese economy4, \n                                                 \n4 Allen et al. (2005) document that the private sector in China dominates the state and listed sectors, both in \nterms of output size and growth trend. Specifically, they show that between 1996 and 2002, the private sector \ngrew at an annual rate of 14.3 percent, while the combined state and listed sector only grew at 5.4 percent. \n 6\nprivate firms are discriminated against in terms of access to external funding, property rights \nprotection, taxation, and market opportunities. Such distortions may force private Chinese \nfirms to look for foreign investors (Huang, 2003; Luo, 2007). By establishing cross-border \nrelationships with foreign firms, private domestic firms can bypass both the financial and \nlegal obstacles that they face at home. FDI can in fact be seen as a form of equity financing \n(Harrison et al., 2004). Moreover, from the very beginning of economic reforms in China, \nforeign-invested firms were accorded a superior legal status compared with private firms.  \n \n2.2 The finance-growth nexus in China \nA first strand of literature has used provincial level data to look at the links between indicators \nof financial development and growth in China obtaining contrasting results. Like ours, most \nof these studies are panel studies. For instance, Liu and Li (2001) analyze the links between \ngrowth and the four sources of total investment in fixed assets (state budget appropriation, \nnational bank loans, self-raised funds, and foreign investment). They find that between 1985 \nand 1998, the growth of national bank loans and self-raised funds are both positively related \nto the growth of provincial output, while state budget appropriation only affects growth in the \ninterior regions, where non state sources of finance might be unavailable. Aziz and Duenwald \n(2002) use data for 27 provinces over the period 1988-97 and find no evidence that financial \ndevelopment (proxied by bank lending) boosts growth among Chinese provinces. \nSpecifically, domestic private credit plays a small role in the financing of the fast growing \nprovinces. Using similar data over the period 1990-1999, Boyreau-Debray (2003) finds that \ncredit extended by the banking sector has a negative impact on growth, which she attributes to \nthe burden of supporting the state-owned corporate sector. Chen (2006) shows that Chinese \ngrowth has been fostered by the substitution of loans for state budget appropriation, but not by \nloan expansion. His findings are challenged by Cheng and Degryse (2006) who argue that \nbanking development spurs growth in China5. These studies make use of different financial \nindicators, and different econometric techniques, which might explain their contrasting \nresults. \n A second strand of literature has focused on firm-level data to try and explain the high \ngrowth rates experienced in China, in spite of a poorly developed financial system. Ayyagari \net al. (2007) rely on the World Bank Investment Climate Survey data that covers 2400 \nChinese firms across 18 different cities. The survey was collected in 2003 and includes \n                                                 \n5 Using a multivariate Vector Autoregression (VAR) approach, based on annual Chinese data over the period \n1952-2001, Liang and Teng (2006) find that high levels of bank credit in China do not cause higher growth. \n 7\ninformation on sources of financing in 2003 and firm level information that are recalled for 3 \nyears, namely 2000, 2001 and 2002. They analyze firm financing patterns, and show that a \nrelatively small percentage of firms in their sample use formal bank finance, while reliance on \ninformal finance is much stronger. They then show that it is finance from the formal financial \nsystem that is associated with faster firm-level growth, while informal finance is not. They \nconclude that it is not the non-standard financing mechanisms that promote growth in China. \nCull et al. (2007) use data drawn from the annual accounting reports filed by industrial firms \nwith the National Bureau of Statistics over the period 1998-2003 to investigate whether trade \ncredit could have been what financed China\u2019s spectacular growth in spite of its \nmalfunctioning financial system. They conclude that trade credit did not play a significant \nrole6.  \nWhile we acknowledge that useful information can be extracted at the micro-level, we \nbelieve that the finance-growth link can and should be apprehended at the macro-level as \nwell. We consider our approach as a useful complement to the recent firm-level analyses that \nlooked at the role of finance on firm performance in China. While the advantage of using \nfirm-level data to describe the financing patterns of firms in recent years is clear-cut, it is of \nless use for the investigation of the evolution of the finance-growth nexus over time (spanning \nthe pre and post liberalization period). Our dataset has the advantage of not only covering a \n15 year-period from 1989 to 2003, but of also covering the entire Chinese territory (without a \nlimitation to the urban sector only). Our paper contributes therefore to the first strand of the \nliterature which analyzed the finance-growth nexus in China. Its specific contributions are \nthat it looks, for the first time in the Chinese context, at the links between finance, GDP \ngrowth, and two of its sources: physical capital accumulation and TFP growth. Moreover, it \nmakes use of a very wide range of financial indicators measuring both financial development \nand distortions, and focusing for the first time, on whether the effects of these indicators on \ngrowth have declined over time, and on whether they differ across provinces characterized by \ndifferent levels of FDI. Our objective is to understand whether there might be circumstances \nunder which financial distortions do not hinder growth. \n                                                 \n6 H\u00e9ricourt and Poncet (2007) and Dollar and Wei (2007) also use firm-level data in the Chinese context, to link, \nto some extent, the financial dimension of the economy and the real dimension. Using World Bank Investment \nClimate Survey data, and focusing on firms\u2019 investment behavior, H\u00e9ricourt and Poncet (2007) show that public \nfirms do not appear to be credit constrained, and are not affected by foreign presence. On the other hand, private \nfirms appear to suffer more from financial constraints, which are however alleviated in the presence of abundant \nforeign investment. Dollar and Wei (2007) use data from a survey conducted in 2005 and covering the period \n2002-2004, to study firms\u2019 returns to capital. Their survey covers 12400 firms in 120 cities, located in all \nChinese provinces (except Tibet). Their results suggest that state-owned firms have significantly lower returns \nthan private and foreign-owned firms. \n 8\n \n3. Data description and summary statistics \nThe key data used in this paper are our indicators of financial intermediary development and \ndistortions, as well as measures of real per capita GDP growth and its components, i.e. per \ncapita capital stock accumulation and per capita productivity growth. Our sample consists of a \npanel of 30 provinces in Mainland China with annual data for the period 1989-20037. All our \nvariables are measured at the province level. Appendix 1 provides details on all variables used \nin our analysis and information on data sources. \n \n3.1 Indicators of financial development and distortions \nOur intention is to evaluate the impact of measures of both financial intermediaries\u2019 \ndevelopment and financial distortions on growth and its sources in the context of China. \nDespite its large size, the Chinese banking sector is still dominated by four large state banks \nthat allocate most of their financial resources to the inefficient and loss-making state-owned \nenterprise sector (Boyreau-Debray, 2003). As such, the transition to a modern and profit-\noriented banking sector is far from being achieved. \nA major challenge in this paper is therefore to disentangle between the effect of \nfinancial deepening and that of the distorting nature of the state-ruled banking sector. We go \nfurther than the indicators of financial development traditionally used in the literature, and \nrely on three families of indicators, intended to proxy for the development of the financial \nsector (Family 1), the misallocation of financial resources (Family 2), and the more modern \nand profit-oriented financial transactions (Family 3). The use of different measures focusing \non different aspects of financial intermediation will allow us to account for both a size and a \nquality effect of the latter. To assess the robustness of our results, we will use several \nindicators within each family. \nTo evaluate the impact of the development of the financial sector, we will use three \nmeasures of financial depth (Family 1), one based on banks alone, and the other two on both \nbank and non-bank sources of financing. More specifically, we will use the following three \nindicators: \n                                                 \n7 China is administratively decomposed into 31 provincial units, which fall into three categories: 22 provinces or \nsheng; 4 autonomous regions or zizhiqu (Nei Monggol, Xinjiang, Tibet, Ningxia and Guangxi); and 4 municipal \ncities or zhixiashi, under direct supervision of the central power (Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing, and, since 1997, \nChongqing). Tibet is excluded from our sample due to data constraints. \n 9\n(1) The ratio of total bank loans to GDP, which measures banking sector size (BANK \nCREDIT)8.  \n(2) The ratio of total (bank and non-bank) loans to GDP, which measures the overall \ndepth of the financial sector (TOTAL CREDIT). \n(3) The ratio of household savings deposited in financial intermediaries relative to GDP \n(SAVINGS), which serves as a proxy of China\u2019s financial intermediary development9. \nTo evaluate the specific impact of misallocation of funds in the finance-growth nexus in \nChina, we rely on the following three measures of the role of distortions induced by state \ninterventionism in the financial sector (Family 2): \n(4) The share of state-owned commercial banks in total bank credit (SOCB CREDIT \nshare). Chinese statistics do not provide any information on credit allocation between \nstate and non-state enterprises. However, given that the state banks\u2019 primary function \nis to channel savings to SOEs, the ratio of the SOCBs credit to total bank credit can be \ninterpreted as a proxy for the credit channelled to the state-owned sector. For instance, \nconservative estimates suggest that in the late 1990s, 80 percent of the total amount of \ncredit by the SOCBs was extended to the SOEs (Boyreau-Debray, 2003). Even with \nthe recent emphasis on profit maximization and management responsibility, state \nbanks may still favor the SOEs, with which they have a long customer history and \nwhich are more likely to be bailed out by the government than non-state enterprises in \ncase of financial distress. In contrast, projects in the non-state sector are perceived as \nmore risky because of higher information costs and moral hazard.  \n(5) The ratio of state-owned commercial banks\u2019 credit to GDP (SOCB CREDIT to GDP).  \n(6) The ratio of loans to deposits of the SOCBs (CENTRAL). This ratio captures another \ndistortion of the Chinese banking sector, namely the interventionism of the Central \nBank. It was previously used by Lardy (1998), Dayal-Gulati and Hussain (2002), and \nBoyreau-Debray (2003). In China, while the volume of deposits is determined by \neconomic activity, the volume of lending is largely determined by policy objectives \n                                                 \n8 Unlike past studies and following Beck et al. (2000), we carefully deflate those financial intermediary statistics, \nwhich are expressed as a ratio to GDP. Specifically, financial stock items are measured at the end of the period, \nwhile GDP is measured over the period. Simply dividing financial stock items by GDP can therefore produce \nmisleading measures of financial development. This paper deflates end-of-year financial balance sheet items by \nend-of-year consumer price indices (CPI), and deflates the GDP series by the annual CPI. We then compute the \naverage of the real financial balance sheet item in year t and t-1, and divide this average by real GDP measured \nin year t. \n9 This indicator excludes corporate deposits, which might be affected by the central government\u2019s credit policies. \nAs argued by Chen (2006), households\u2019 deposits are based on households\u2019 own decisions, and are much less \ninfluenced by the central government\u2019s policies than loans. \n 10\nand is set through a credit plan, independently of the ability of branch banks in each \nregion to finance the lending target from local deposits (Lardy, 1998). As pointed out \nby Boyreau-Debray (2003), some rapidly growing provinces could therefore have a \nlow credit quota and be constrained in their lending relative to the rapid growth of \ntheir deposits. Alternatively, branch banks in slower growing regions could be \nassigned high quotas with insufficient local deposits to finance their lending: these \nprovinces would therefore depend on the Central Bank to lend them additional funds. \nWe follow the literature and consider the ratio of SOCB loans to deposits as a measure \nof the Central Bank\u2019s credit to local branch banks aimed at helping them to meet their \nlending quotas.  \nOur third family of indicators intends to proxy for the efficient use of capital in a context \nof widespread misallocation. We rely on information of the decomposition of fixed asset \ninvestment financing by source. This is typically broken into domestic loans, state budgetary \nappropriation, foreign investment, and self-raised funds10. In general, loans are considered a \nmore efficient means of resource distribution than state budget allocation. Unlike state budget \nappropriation, loans call in fact for payments of interest and principals, helping to harden \nenterprises\u2019 budget constraints, and promoting more efficient use of capital. Self-raised funds \nmay represent even harder budget constraints in a context of ineffectual decision-making and \nexcessive investment. Both Liu and Li (2001) and Chen (2006) make use of these measures of \nfixed assets investment financing. The former find a positive and significant relationship \nbetween growth and fixed asset investments financed by domestic loans and self-raised funds, \nand the latter conclude that, while loan expansion did not directly contribute to growth, the \nsubstitution of loans for state budget appropriation significantly fostered it. \nWe construct the following two measures of market and profit-oriented financial \ntransactions (Family 3): \n(7) The share of fixed asset investment financed by domestic loans relative to that \nfinanced by state budgetary appropriation (LOANS over APPRO). \n(8) The share of fixed asset investment financed by self-raised funds (SELF RAISED \nFUNDS). \n                                                 \n10 Domestic loans include funds borrowed from domestic banks and non-bank financial institutions by local \nenterprises and institutions. State budgetary appropriation consists essentially of appropriation in the government \nbudget earmarked for capital construction and infrastructure projects. Foreign investment refers to foreign funds \nin fixed assets, foreign funds borrowed and managed by the government or by individual units, as well as foreign \nfunds in joint-ventures. Self-raised funds include funds raised by various types of enterprises through non-state \nchannels such as bonds, stocks, venture capital, and retained earnings. \n 11\nAll our financial indicators are measured at the provincial level. This can be justified \nconsidering that although banks can technically finance across provincial lines, the majority \nof their activities takes place within provinces. The World Bank\u2019s (2005) report on markets \nintegration in China indicates a positive and significant correlation between provincial bank \ndeposits and loans (p. 136). In the light of the Feldstein and Horioka (1980) test, this finding \nsuggests a very limited intra-national mobility of bank financing. This result holds even after \ncontrolling for national factors and province-specific shocks. Moreover, an increased \ncorrelation is observed in the 1990s, suggesting a decrease in capital mobility within the \nbanking sector in most recent years11. \n \n3.2 Indicators of economic growth and its sources \nOur investigation of the finance-growth nexus in China will assess the impact of our various \nindicators of financial development on real per capita GDP growth, capital accumulation, and \nproductivity growth. \nThe rate of real per capita GDP growth (GDP GROWTH) is computed as yearly \ngrowth of per capita GDP deflated by consumer prices. The growth rate of the per capita \nphysical capital stock (CAPITAL GROWTH) is computed using the perpetual inventory \nmethod. We follow Harberger\u2019s (1978) suggestion for deriving an initial estimate of the \ncapital stock, which assumes that each province was at its steady-state capital-output ratio in \n197412. We then apply the perpetual inventory method with a depreciation rate (\u03b4) of five \npercent to compute capital stocks in later years. The capital stock (Kt) is therefore computed \nusing the following formula: Kt+1 = Kt + It \u2013 \u03b4 Kt, where It represents real investment in fixed \nassets. \nAs in Beck et al. (2000), our measure of productivity growth (TFP GROWTH) builds \non the neoclassical production function. We assume that this aggregate production function is \ncommon across provinces and time, so that aggregate output in province i, Yi, is given by the \n                                                 \n11 As highlighted by World Bank (2005), in 2000, only 5 percent of financial flows were conducted through the \nbond and stock markets. While recent shifts in financial portfolios suggest a tendency of the Chinese capital \nmarket to evolve towards a more market-based system in which direct financing through stocks and bonds plays \nan incrementally more important role, this development is still at its infancy. For this reason, we have not \nincluded stock-market related indicators among our financial indicators. \n12 As argued by Beck et al. (2000), while this assumption is surely incorrect, it is better than assuming an initial \ncapital stock of zero, which many researchers use. The initial stock is computed for the year 1974, the first year \nfor which data on investment flows are available. Alternative measures of capital growth based on assuming an \ninitial stock of zero produced similar results. Also note that capital stock figures are computed based on the \naccumulation (perpetual inventory method) of total investment in fixed assets deflated by the GDP deflator. \nUnfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, no statistics exist at the provincial level over our period of \ninvestigation on capital-type specific deflators. \n 12\nfollowing expression: 1i i i iY A K L\n\u03b1 \u03b1\u2212= , where K denotes the capital stock; L, labor; and A, \nthe level of total factor productivity. We solve for the growth rate of per capita productivity \nby first dividing all terms in the production function by L to get per capita production. We \nthen take logarithms and the time derivative. Finally, we use the decomposition of province \nlevel gross domestic product into compensation of workers, depreciation of fixed assets, net \ntaxes on production, and operating surplus, in order to compute labor shares for each Chinese \nprovince. We rely on data for 1997 (which is the first year this information is provided by the \nNational Bureau of Statistics in the China Statistical Yearbook) to compute these province-\nspecific labor shares. We then derive province-level capital shares, \u03b1i, as 1-(labor \ncompensation\/GDP)i, and use them to calculate per capita TFP growth as follows13: \n \nTFP GROWTHi,t = GDP GROWTHi,t \u2013 \u03b1i * CAPITAL GROWTHi,t     (1) \n \n3.3 Descriptive statistics and correlations \nThe summary statistics of our variables are presented in Table 1a. Column (1) refers to the \nentire sample; columns (2) and (3) to the early (1989-1999) and late (2000-2003) periods, \nrespectively; and columns (4) and (5), respectively to those province-year observations \nbelonging to the three lower quartiles, and the highest quartile of the distribution of the FDI \nstock to GDP ratio. \nComparing the early with the late period, we can observe no major differences in the \ngrowth rates of GDP, TFP, and capital stock. Yet, the later period is characterized by a much \nhigher GDP per capita, with no major differences in the FDI inflows to GDP ratio. It is also \ninteresting to note that the share of population with more than primary education increased \nfrom about 73 percent in the early years to 86 percent in the later years, that the inflation rate \ndeclined from 9.28 percent to 0.52 percent, and that the share of state entities in total fixed \nassets declined from 65 percent to 52 percent.  \nComing to our financial indicators, the statistics suggest that financial depth, which \nwas already high at the start of the period, further increased from 1989 to 2003: the ratio of \ntotal bank loans to GDP rose from 78 percent to 91 percent, while the ratio of total loans to \nGDP rose from 95 percent to 109 percent. State interventionism, on the other hand, declined, \nprobably as a result of the financial reforms discussed in the previous Section. In particular, \n                                                 \n13 The capital share varies from 0.65 in the case of Shanghai to 0.30 in the case of Guangxi, and is on average \nequal to 0.35. We thank an anonymous Referee for suggesting the calculation of province-specific capital shares. \n 13\nthe share of SOCB credit in total bank credit declined from 68 percent to 59 percent, while the \nratio of loans to deposits of the SOCBs declined from 112 percent to 77 percent. Surprisingly, \nthe share of fixed assets investment financed by loans relative to that financed by state budget \nappropriation also declined over time, as did the share financed by self-raised funds. \nComparing the low and high-FDI province-year observations, we can see that the \nlatter are characterized by higher GDP, TFP, and capital stock growth, by a higher level of \nGDP, degree of openness, percentage of educated people, and a lower share of state entities in \ntotal investment. The high-FDI regions also display a higher degree of financial depth, and a \nlower degree of state interventionism than their low-FDI counterparts. Finally, the share of \nfixed assets investment financed by loans relative to that financed by state budget \nappropriation is higher for high FDI recipients, while the share financed by self-raised funds \nis slightly lower. \nTable 1b presents the correlation matrix between our growth variables and our \nfinancial indicators. We can see that our Family 1 and Family 2 indicators are negatively \nrelated with GDP and TFP growth, as well as with physical capital accumulation, while the \ncorrelation between our Family 3 indicators, growth, and its sources is generally positive. In \nthe Section that follows, we will provide formal evidence for the effects of our financial \nindicators on GDP and TFP growth, and capital accumulation. We will also investigate \nwhether the relationship between our financial indicators, growth, and its sources has changed \nover time, and whether it differs across provinces with different FDI stock to GDP ratios. \n \n4. Econometric methodology and baseline specification \nIn this Section, we first present our baseline growth equation, and discuss the conditioning \ninformation set that we use. We then describe our econometric methodology. \n \n4.1 Baseline specification \nWe use a cross-province time-series panel of data to estimate the relationship between finance \nand GDP growth, capital accumulation, and productivity growth14. Our baseline regression \ntakes the following form: \n \n\u03b5\u03bb\u03b7\u03b3\u03b2\u03b1 tititititi CONTROLFINANCEY ,,,, +++++=\u2206      (2) \n                                                 \n14 We rely on annual growth rate to maximize the number of observations. Our results were robust to using two \nyear averages. The results based on the two year averages are not reported for brevity, but are available on \nrequest. \n 14\n \nwhere i indexes our 30 provinces, and t, time. \u2206Y is either GDP GROWTH, CAPITAL \nGROWTH, or TFP GROWTH. FINANCE represents in turn each of the eight indicators \npresented in Section 3.1 to proxy respectively for the size of the financial sector, its state-\ninduced distorting nature, and its market driven functioning. CONTROL is defined according \nto the augmented Solow model as proposed by Mankiw et al. (1992). The logarithm of lagged \nreal per capita GDP is included to control for convergence. We also introduce the share of \npopulation with more than primary schooling as a proxy for human capital (EDUCATION). \nThe following five additional policy variables that have been identified in the empirical \ngrowth literature as being correlated with growth performance across countries (Barro, 1991; \nEasterly et al., 1997) are also included: government expenditure over GDP as an indicator of \ngovernment size (GOV); the rate of inflation based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI); trade \nas a share of GDP (OPENNESS), and FDI inflows as share of GDP (FDI), to capture the \ndegree of openness of the economy; and the share of state entities in total investment (STATE \nENTITIES) as an indicator of low progress in reform. Finally, provincial fixed effects and \ntime fixed effects are denoted by \u03b7i and \u03bbt respectively, and \u03b5i,t is an idiosyncratic error term. \n \n4.2. Econometric methodology \nLet us focus on GDP growth as our dependent variable, and denote with y, the logarithm of \nreal per capita GDP; and with X, our set of explanatory variables (including our financial \nindicators and other control variables expressed in logarithms, but excluding lagged per capita \nGDP). Our real per capita GDP growth Equation can be expressed as follows: \n \nyi,t-yi,t-1 = (\u03b1-1)yi,t-1 + \u03b2\u2019Xi,t + vi + vt + ei,t ,       (3) \n \nThe error term in Equation (3) is made up of the following components: vi, which denotes a \nprovince-specific component (encompassing any permanent additive measurement error); vt, \nwhich represents a time-specific component (that we account for by including time dummies \nin all our specifications); and ei,t, which is an idiosyncratic component. Equation (3) can be \nrewritten as follows: \n \nyi,t = \u03b1yi,t-1 + \u03b2\u2019Xi,t + vi +  vt + ei,t,        (4) \n \n 15\nEquation (4) can be estimated using a within-groups estimator, which controls for \nprovince-specific heterogeneity. Yet, since the lagged dependent variable is introduced among \nthe regressors, together with the provincial fixed effects, this estimator is biased and \ninconsistent even if ei,t is not serially correlated, as the lagged dependent variable is correlated \nwith the error term15. Moreover, in all specifications, most of the explanatory variables can be \nexpected to be endogenously determined (and many of them are likely to be measured with \nerror). We thus need to control for the endogeneity arising both from the dynamic \nspecification of the equation and from reverse causation.  \nExternal instruments such as legal origin, which have been commonly used in the \nliterature (La Porta et al., 1997, 1998) cannot be used in our context since Chinese provinces \nshare a common legal system and similar institutions. Alternatively, we rely on internal \ninstruments, using the Generalized-Method-of-Moments (GMM) panel estimator, proposed \nby Arellano and Bond (1991) and Blundell and Bond (1998), which relies on first-\ndifferencing the estimating equation to get rid of the province-specific fixed effect, and uses \nappropriate lags of the right-hand side variables as instruments.  \nAs can be seen from the following Equation, first-differencing (4) allows us to \neliminate the province-specific effect, vi: \n \nyi,t- yi, t-1 = \u03b1(yi,t-1 \u2013 yi, t-2) + \u03b2\u2019(Xi,t- Xi, t-1) + (vt- vt-1) + (ei,t- ei, t-1)     (5) \n \nYet, in order to estimate Equation (5), instrumentation is still necessary to deal with the \npossible endogeneity of the regressors, and with the correlation between (yi,t-1 \u2013 yi, t-2) and (ei,t- \nei, t-1). Assuming that ei,t is not serially correlated and that the regressors contained in X are \nweakly exogenous (meaning that they are uncorrelated with future realizations of the error \nterm), the GMM first-difference estimator uses the following moment conditions: \n \nE[yi,t-s (ei,t- ei, t-1)]=0 for s\u22652; t=3,\u2026,15       (6) \nE[Xi,t-s (ei,t- ei, t-1)]=0 for s\u22652; t=3,\u2026, 15       (7) \n \n                                                 \n15 This bias is generally referred to as the Nickell (1981) bias. Nickell (1981) derives a formula for this bias \n(when there are no exogenous regressors), showing that it approaches 0 as the sample size tends to infinity. The \nwithin-groups estimator is thus likely to perform well only when the time dimension of the panel is large. \n 16\nThese moment conditions imply that values of real per capita GDP (y) and of all the X\u2019s \nlagged twice or more can be used as instruments in our regressions16.  \n The GMM first-difference estimator, suffers however from a significant shortcoming. \nBlundell and Bond (1998) have shown that when the explanatory variables are persistent over \ntime, lagged levels of these variables are weak instruments for the regression equation \nexpressed in first-differences17. This is likely to lead to biased coefficients, and the problem is \ngenerally exacerbated in small samples. To avoid this bias, Blundell and Bond (1998) \nproposed a system-GMM estimator. This estimator basically combines in a system the first-\ndifferenced Equation (5) with the same Equation expressed in levels. The instruments for the \nregression in differences are the same as those described above, while the instruments for the \nEquation in levels are lagged differences of the corresponding variables18. The additional \nmoment conditions in the system-GMM estimator are: \n \nE[(yi,t-s-yi,t-s-1) (vi + ei,t)] = 0 for s=1; t=3,\u2026,15      (8) \nE[(Xi,t-s-Xi,t-s-1) (vi + ei,t)] = 0 for s=1; t=3,\u2026,15      (9) \n \nAs discussed in Bond et al. (2001), Berg and Krueger (2004), and Hauk and Wacziarg (2004), \nthe system-GMM is indeed the most suitable way to address the problems of estimating \ngrowth regressions. For this reason, we use this particular estimator in the estimation of all \nEquations in our paper.19 \nConsistency of the GMM estimates depends on the validity of the instruments. We test \nfor the validity of our instruments by using two tests suggested by Arellano and Bond (1991): \nthe J test and the test for second-order serial correlation of the residuals (m2). The former is \nthe Sargan test for overidentifying restrictions, asymptotically distributed as a chi-square with \ndegrees of freedom equal to the number of instruments less the number of parameters, under \n                                                 \n16 The first-difference GMM estimator was originally developed by Arellano and Bond (1991) and was first \nintroduced in the growth literature by Caselli et al. (1996). \n17 Blundell and Bond (1998) also show that the instruments used with the standard first-differenced GMM \nestimator (i.e. the endogenous variables lagged two or more periods) become less informative in models where \nthe variance of the fixed effects is particularly high relative to the variance of the transitory shocks.  \n18 The latter are valid instruments under the assumption that there is no correlation between the differences of \nthese variables and the province-specific effect. Note that considering that lagged levels of the regressors are \nused as instruments for the differenced equation, it is sufficient to use only the most recent difference as an \ninstrument in the equation in levels.  \n19 All our results were robust to using the simple first-difference GMM estimator rather than the system-GMM. \nAlso note that while estimates obtained using the first-difference GMM estimator only reflect the within-\nprovinces dimension of the relationship between financial indicators and growth, as the between-provinces \ndimension is differenced away, the system-GMM estimator also allows us to consider the latter dimension. \n 17\nthe null of instrument validity.20 The m2 test is asymptotically distributed as a standard \nnormal under the null of no second-order serial correlation, and provides a further check on \nthe specification of the model and on the legitimacy of variables dated t-2 as instruments. As \nstated in Beck et al. (2000), the appropriateness of the instrumental variables \u201cgives credence \nto the conclusion that the estimated [\u2026] link between finance and growth is not due to \nsimultaneity bias or insufficient control for other determinants of growth.\u201d (p. 35).  \n \n5. Regression results \n \n5.1 Main results \nTable 2 reports the system-GMM estimates of Equation (2) where \u2206Yi,t is the real per capita \nGDP growth rate21. The results show a statistically and economically significant relationship \nbetween our financial indicators and economic growth. Specifically, our Family 1 indicators \nall attract a negative coefficient, suggesting that financial depth is negatively associated with \ngrowth. To assess the economic magnitude of this association, let us consider, for instance, a \nprovince exogenously moving from the 25th percentile of the distribution of the ratio of bank \nloans to GDP (58.1 percent) to the 75th percentile (96.8 percent). Using the coefficient in \ncolumn 2 of Table 2, this province would experience a 0.92 percentage points slower GDP \ngrowth rate, which is an economically significant number. These findings contrast with the \ntypical conclusion of most cross-country studies that analyzed the finance-growth nexus, \nfinding a positive link between financial depth and growth. They can be a consequence of \npolicies, which have promoted inefficient allocation of savings. These policies can be \nexplained by the fact that the state\u2019s main objective is not to maximize efficiency. In \nparticular, it might channel capital to poor, slow-growing regions, with the aim of reducing \npoverty (Boyreau-Debray, 2003; Boyreau-Debray and Wei, 2005). \nOur Family 2 indicators are also negatively associated with growth, probably due to \nthe inefficient allocation of savings by the state-banking sector, as well as to the fact that \nstate-owned banks mainly support the relatively inefficient state-owned sector. As argued by \nBoyreau-Debray and Wei (2005), the state typically channels capital (through state-owned \nbanks) to the inefficient SOEs, in order to avoid the unemployment consequences that would \n                                                 \n20 It should be noted that when panels with a short cross-sectional dimension are used, the Sargan test has low \npower (Baltagi et al., 2007). \n21 All our results were robust to using the within-groups estimator. We only report the system-GMM estimates \nfor brevity. The estimates obtained using the within-groups estimator can be found in Guariglia and Poncet \n(2006). \n 18\nfollow from SOE bankruptcy. Focusing on the ratio of state-owned banks\u2019 credit to GDP and \nusing the coefficient in column 6 of Table 2, a province exogenously moving from the 25th \npercentile of the distribution of state-owned banks\u2019 credit to GDP (45.8 percent) to the 75th \npercentile (78.3 percent) would experience a 1.66 percentage points slower GDP growth rate, \nwhich is once again economically significant22.  \nFinally, our Family 3 indicators generally display positive coefficients, suggesting that \na higher use of more market and profit-oriented financial transactions (such as loans relative \nto state budget appropriation, and self-raised funds) promotes growth. For instance, based on \nthe coefficient reported in column 9 of Table 2, a province exogenously moving from the 25th \npercentile of the distribution of the share of fixed investment financed by self-raised funds \n(41.1 percent) to the 75th percentile (52.8 percent) would benefit from a 1.03 percentage point \nfaster GDP growth rate. \nThe variables in the conditioning information set also have the expected signs. Lagged \nGDP per capita attracts a negative (although not always significant) coefficient, indicating a \nprocess of convergence. Our proxy for human capital accumulation generally attracts a \npositive and significant coefficient. Finally, among our policy indicators, the share of state \nentities in total investment enters as a negative determinant of economic growth, while our \nproxies for the degree of openness (trade and FDI share of GDP) have a positive impact on \neconomic growth.  \nThe Sargan test of overidentifying restrictions indicates that the orthogonality \nconditions cannot be rejected at the five percent level, and the m2 test for the second order \nautocorrelation of the first-differenced residuals suggests that the error term is not serially \ncorrelated. Thus, we do not reject the null hypothesis that the instruments are appropriate. The \nstrong link between finance and growth does not appear to be driven by simultaneity bias.  \nTable 3 presents the system-GMM estimates relative to physical capital accumulation, \nand Table 4, those relative to TFP growth23. Table 3 shows that like in the case of real GDP \ngrowth, all our Family 1 and Family 2 indicators are negatively associated with physical \n                                                 \n22 (1- SOCB CREDIT share) is the share of non state-owned commercial banks in total credit, and can be seen as \na proxy for the money lent to the private sector. Using this variable as a financial indicator shows that the share \nof non-state-owned commercial banks in total credit exerts a positive effect on economic growth and its sources. \nThis suggests that the higher the share of total credit that is provided by non-state banks, the more credit flows \ntowards the more efficient private firms, allowing them to grow faster, and raising provincial GDP and \nproductivity growth. Moreover, it is likely that compared to state-owned banks, non-state owned banks are more \nengaged in researching firms before making the actual loans, and in exerting corporate control once the loan has \nbeen made, leading to a higher efficiency in the process, and consequently, to higher GDP and productivity \ngrowth. These results are not reported for brevity, but are available from the authors upon request. \n23 Since the province of Chongqing was only created in 1997, it was not possible to compute its capital stock. As \nsuch, only 29 provinces are used in the capital stock and TFP growth equations. \n 19\ncapital accumulation. Thus, contrary to Beck et al. (2000), financial intermediary \ndevelopment indicators do have a significant impact on capital accumulation. This can be \nseen as evidence that the inefficient allocation of saving hampers capital accumulation, \nprobably because the private firms, which have more potential to invest, are unable to obtain \nfunds. Coming to our Family 3 indicators, we can see that only the share of total investment \nin fixed assets financed by self-raised funds has a positive and significant effect on capital \naccumulation.  \nWe obtain similar results for productivity growth (Table 4): in this case, however, the \ncoefficients associated with our Family 3 indicators are all positive and statistically \nsignificant. These results point to the fact that the positive impact of market and profit-\noriented financial transactions on economic growth mainly operates through enhanced \nefficiency, while the negative impact of other financial indicators seems to work both through \nlower returns and capital constraints. \n \n5.2 Can reverse causality be ruled out? \nAlthough the use of a system-GMM estimator ensures that the relationship found between \nfinance and growth is essentially explained by the effects of the exogenous component of our \nfinancial indicators on growth, it does not completely rule out that growth can also influence \nfinancial development. To further investigate the issue of reverse causality of the relationship \nbetween finance and economic growth, we have performed a panel Granger causality test \n(Holtz-Eakin et al., 1989), for whether growth causes subsequent financial development. \nSpecifically, we have estimated an Equation of the following type: \n \nFINANCEi,t = aoFINANCEi,t-1+ a1FINANCEi,t-2+ b1 GDP GROWTHi,t-1 +  \n+ b2 GDP GROWTHi, t-2+ ei+ et + vi,t,     (10) \n \nwhere FINANCEi,t represents in turn one of our eight financial indicators; ei  denotes province \nfixed-effects; et, time-fixed effects; and vi,t, an idiosyncratic error term. In this framework, the \nvariable GDP GROWTH is said not to Granger cause the variable FINANCE if all the \ncoefficients on lagged GDP GROWTH in Equation (10) are not significantly different from 0, \ni.e. if b1 = b2 = 0. The results of the estimates of Equation (10), together with the p-values \nassociated with the F-test aimed at testing our null hypothesis are presented in Table A1 in \nAppendix 2. We can see that for each of our eight financial indicators, the null hypothesis \n 20\ncannot be rejected. There is therefore no evidence that GDP GROWTH Granger causes \nfinancial development24.  \nAn alternative way to test for whether GDP GROWTH Granger causes FINANCE is to \nestimate both the restricted (assuming that b1 = b2 = 0) and unrestricted models using the same \nmoment conditions, and compare their Sargan statistics using an incremental Sargan\/J test of \nthe form: DRU = n(J1 \u2013 J2), where J1 denotes the J statistic for the restricted model; J2, the J \nstatistic for the unrestricted model; and n, the number of observations (Bond et al., 2001; \nBond and Windmeijer, 2005). Under the null hypothesis that GDP GROWTH does not \nGranger cause FINANCE, DRU is asymptotically distributed as a \u03c72 with r degrees of freedom, \nwhere r is the number of restrictions (2 in our case). Table A1, in Appendix 2 reports the DRU \nstatistics for our eight financial indicators: in all cases, we cannot reject the null hypothesis \nthat GDP GROWTH does not Granger cause FINANCE 25.  \nOur results so far indicate that financial distortions do represent an impediment to \neconomic growth26. But what can then explain the phenomenal growth characterizing the \nChinese economy? We attempt to answer this question by looking first at whether the \nnegative relationship between finance and growth has become weaker over time, as a \nconsequence of the banking sector reforms, and then by trying to determine whether there are \ncircumstances under which financial distortions might not be an impediment to economic \ngrowth after all. \n \n6. Evolution over time and FDI dependence of the finance-growth relationship \n \n6.1 Evolution over time \nAs we discussed in Section 2.1, since the beginning of the economic reform, China has \nexperienced a fundamental change with regard to the means of allocating financial resources. \nMajor banking reforms were initiated in 1994, and a further impulse for changes in the \nbanking sector came about with China\u2019s entry in the WTO in 2001. Consequently, as shown in \nTable 1a, state interventionism has significantly declined in the latest years of our sample. \nHowever, although these changes in banking policy are important, serious banking sector \n                                                 \n24 These results were robust to adding other control variables to the regressions. \n25 Similar results, not reported for brevity, but available from the authors upon request, hold for per capita capital \naccumulation, and per capita TFP growth. \n26 Our results were generally robust to adding further regressors measuring the quality of institutions, such as the \nshare of private firms in output or employment, and an indicator measuring the number of opened economic \nzones, i.e. the zones allowed to operate in an economic environment without regulations against the \nmarketization and internationalization of economic activities (D\u00e9murger et al., 2002). \n 21\nproblems remain. It is therefore of primary interest to investigate whether the relationship \nbetween finance and economic growth has evolved over the period of reform. We would \nexpect that the rationalization and introduction of market driven practices in the final years of \nour sample would mitigate the problem of misallocation of funds, and therefore reduce the \nestimated negative impact of our indicators of financial development and state interference on \ngrowth. We also anticipate that reforms will reduce the differences between the various \nsources of financing in terms of returns to investment. In a context of widespread efficiency, \nthere is in fact no reason to expect higher effects on growth of investment financed by loans, \nstate appropriation, or self-raised funds. Returns to investment financed with different sources \nshould converge and equalize in parallel with financial system reforms, so that our indicators \nof market driven finance would lose their relevance over time. In order to test this hypothesis, \nwe estimate the following variant of Equation (2):  \n \n\u03b5\u03bb\u03b7\u03b2 \u03b3\u03b2\u03b1 tititittititi CONTROLLATEFINANCEFINANCEY ,,,2,1, * ++++++=\u2206   (11) \n \nwhere LATEt represents a dummy equal to 1 in 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2003, and 0 \notherwise27. If the estimated negative impact of our indicators of financial development and \nstate interference on growth is indeed reduced in the later years of our sample, and the \npositive impact of our indicators of market driven finance is mitigated, then we should \nobserve a positive and significant \u03b22 coefficient for our Family 1 and 2 indicators, and a \nnegative and significant \u03b22 coefficient for Family 3 indicators (together with a negative \u03b21 \ncoefficient for Family 1 and 2 indicators, and a positive \u03b21 coefficient for Family 3 \nindicators). \n The estimates of Equation (11) for GDP growth, capital accumulation, and TFP \ngrowth are respectively presented in columns 1, 2, and 3 of Table 528. Columns 1 and 3 show \nthat the coefficients associated with Family 1 financial indicators are negative and precisely \ndetermined, while the interactions between the indicators and the LATE dummy are generally \npositive and statistically significant. This suggests that the negative effect of most Family 1 \nfinancial indicators on GDP and TFP growth became weaker over the final years of our \nsample (2000-2003), possibly due to the financial system reforms, which reduced the \n                                                 \n27 Our results were generally robust to setting the dummy LATEt equal to one in 2001 to 2003; or in 1999 to \n2003. \n28 To save space, Table 5 only shows the coefficients on our financial indicators and the interaction terms. Full \nestimates can be found in Guariglia and Poncet (2006). \n 22\nsystem\u2019s inefficiencies. In a number of cases, summing the coefficients on the financial depth \nindicators and that on the same indicators interacted with the dummy gives a positive number: \nthis shows that financial depth became positively associated with GDP and TFP growth after \n2000. For instance, focusing on column 1 of Table 5, and summing the coefficients on BANK \nCREDIT, and its interaction with the LATE dummy, yields 0.008, which can be interpreted as \nthe coefficient on BANK CREDIT in the latest years of the sample (2000-2003). This number \nsuggests that if a province were to exogenously move from the 25th percentile of the 2000-\n2003 distribution of BANK CREDIT (66 percent) to the 75th percentile (103 percent), it would \nexperience a 0.36 percentage point faster GDP growth rate. \nColumn 2 of Table 5 reports the regressions for capital accumulation: the relationship \nbetween our Family 1 financial indicators and capital accumulation did not significantly \nchange over time. This can be explained by the fact that a more efficient financial system led \nto a rationalization of investment behavior, and not to an increase in capital accumulation. \nRawski (2006) documents China\u2019s traditional reliance on \u201cextensive\u201d growth achieved by \nadding more resources to the production process, rather than \u201cintensive\u201d growth based on \nhigher productivity. Officially managed investments typically generate low returns, and the \noverall investment picture in China reveals a surprising persistence of Soviet-style outcomes. \nVigorous reform efforts are expected to increase investment returns and address the problems \nof ineffectual decision-making (Von Pfeil, 2004). As such, financial system reforms should \nhelp mitigating the Soviet-style seasonality pattern in investment spending and reduce \nexcessive investment.  \nThe negative effects of most of our Family 2 indicators on GDP, TFP, and capital \nstock growth appears to generally have declined or been reversed over time, although not all \nindicators are associated with a positive and significant \u03b22 coefficient. \nComing to our Family 3 indicators, all columns of Table 5 show that their positive \neffect on GDP and TFP growth, and physical capital accumulation, declined over time (the \ninteraction terms attract negative and precisely determined coefficients), and in some cases \nbecame insignificantly different from zero. This can be explained by the fact that as the \nbanking system became more efficient, it started to positively affect growth and its sources, \nreducing the difference in terms of effects on growth of the alternative forms of financing \nsuch as self-raised funds.  \nFinancial distortions have therefore declined over time, hindering growth to a lower \nextent. Yet, China\u2019s growth has been phenomenal not only after 2000, but also before that, \n 23\nwhen financial distortions were still severe. So what can explain the co-existence between this \nsustained growth and strong financial distortions? \n \n6.2 Does the finance-growth relation depend on FDI presence in each province? \nWe now investigate whether the sensitivity of economic performance to financial \nintermediation depends on the FDI to GDP ratio in each province. This analysis is motivated \nby Harrison et al. (2004), according to whom firms in countries with greater FDI inflows \nsuffer less from financial constraints and have therefore more growth opportunities, as \nincoming foreign investment provides additional sources of capital. Specifically, in the \nChinese case, private enterprises may look for foreign investors, being constrained in their \nactivity due to distortions in the state-dominated financial system (Huang, 2003; Luo, 2007)29. \nAs we discussed in Section 2.1, most of the SOCBs\u2019 credit goes in fact to SOEs, and banks \ntypically impose stricter scrutiny criteria and collateral requirements on private firms \ncompared to other firms (financial bias). The problem was exacerbated prior to 2004 when \nChina\u2019s Constitution did not commit to the protection of property rights of private firms (legal \nbias). Establishing joint-ventures with foreign firms may allow private firms to bypass both \nthe financial bias (by using foreign firms as sources of finance) and the legal bias (by \naccessing the superior legal protection and regulatory treatment granted to foreign firms)30. \nOn average, over the period under investigation, FDI accounted for 8.7 percent of the total \ninvestment in fixed assets at the provincial level (China Statistical Yearbook, various issues). \nThe share peaked at 13.9 percent in 1994. It is thus very likely that FDI is a significant source \nof financing for Chinese firms. \nOur aim is to determine whether in the presence of FDI, financial distortions may \nbecome less of an impediment to economic growth. We conduct a straightforward test of this \nhypothesis, introducing interaction terms of our indicators of financial intermediation, with \n                                                 \n29 Havrylchyk and Poncet (2007) provide primary empirical confirmation of this thesis. They find that indicators \nof the distorting nature of the inefficient banking sector are important determinants of the FDI received by \nChinese provinces. It should be noted, however, that while this thesis might explain part of the inward FDI in \nChina, it cannot explain the very rapid increase that took place more recently, when discrimination against \nprivate firms was becoming less relevant. See Prasad and Wei (2005) for a discussion of other possible factors \nexplaining the behavior of FDI in China in recent years. \n30 Prior to 1999, private firms were also banned from exporting directly, while foreign-invested firms were \ngranted automatic trading licenses within their lines of business. Establishing joint-ventures with foreign firms \nmade it therefore easier for private firms to enter export markets. \n 24\nthe logarithm of the stock of FDI to GDP in each province and year (FDI stocki,t\/GDPi,t)31. \nWe therefore estimate the following Equation: \n \n\u03b5\u03bb\u03b7\u03b3\n\u03b2\u03b2\u03b1\ntititi\nti\nti\ntititi\nCONTROL\nGDP\nstockFDI\nFINANCEFINANCEY\n,,\n,\n,\n,2,1, *\n++++\n+\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b++=\u2206\n   (12) \n \nA positive \u03b22 coefficient for Family 1 and 2 financial indicators, and a negative \u03b22 \ncoefficient for Family 3 indicators (together with a negative \u03b21 coefficient for Family 1 and 2 \nindicators, and a positive \u03b21 coefficient for Family 3 indicators) would suggest that the higher \nthe FDI in each region, the lower the constraints related to the misallocation of finance, and \nthe less the heterogeneity in terms of returns to investment depending on financing sources32.  \nThe estimates of Equation (12) for GDP growth, capital accumulation, and TFP \ngrowth are respectively presented in columns 1, 2, and 3 of Table 633. The results suggest that \nprovinces characterized by higher FDI stocks relative to GDP tend to suffer less from the \nnegative effects of Family 2 indicators on GDP, capital, and TFP growth. For instance, the \nresults in column 1 show that if a province with an FDI stock to GDP ratio of 10.05 percent \n(the sample mean less one third the sample standard deviation) were to exogenously move \nfrom the 25th percentile of the distribution of the SOCB CREDIT share (55 percent) to the 75th \npercentile (74 percent), it would experience a 0.99 percentage point slower per capita GDP \ngrowth rate. For a province with an FDI stock to GDP ratio twice as large, the same increase \nin SOCB CREDIT would result in a 0.45 percentage point slower GDP growth rate. These \nfindings support the view that FDI may be used as a way to bypass the inefficiencies of the \nlocal banking sector. In particular, private firms, for whom it is difficult to obtain loans from \nstate banks, may use foreign joint-ventures to acquire needed capital, and can in this way \nachieve higher productivity and growth rates (Harrison et al., 2004; Huang, 2003; Luo, \n2007)34.  \n                                                 \n31 We use the stock of FDI to GDP ratio as an interaction term, instead of the ratio of FDI inflows to GDP, since \nthe former indicator is likely to better capture the overall presence of foreign firms in each province. Our results \nwere generally robust to using the ratio of FDI inflows to GDP as an interaction term. \n32 Using a similar methodology, Rioja and Valev (2004) study whether the relationship between finance and \ngrowth varies across countries characterized by different levels of financial development. \n33 Once again, to save space, Table 6 only shows the coefficients on our financial indicators and the interaction \nterms. Full estimates can be found in Guariglia and Poncet (2006). \n34 Inspection of data from the World Bank Investment Climate Survey (2003), which includes 2400 firms \nsurveyed in 13 cities in 2003, suggests that 12 percent of private firms (i.e. of those firms with a private share \ngreater than 49 percent) have shares owned by a foreign partner. Moreover, the sales per employee of these firms \n 25\nSimilar results are observed for the effects of our Family 1 indicators on TFP growth, \nbut not for GDP and capital growth35. Coming to our Family 3 indicators, we find that the \npositive effects of loans over state budget appropriation on GDP and TFP growth are lower in \nhigh FDI recipient provinces.  \nIn sum, our results indicate that provinces with higher FDI stocks relative to GDP \nbenefit from faster economic growth primarily thanks to enhanced efficiency, and seem to be \nless sensitive to the negative impact of state intervention induced inefficiency and constraints \nin capital access36. FDI can therefore help to alleviate the costs associated with financial \ndistortions, and could provide an explanation for why, as discussed by Allen at al. (2005), \nChina is a counterexample to the findings of the finance-growth literature, being characterized \nby malfunctioning financial institutions and phenomenal growth rates37.  \n \n7. Conclusions \nWe have used data for 30 Chinese provinces over the period 1989-2003 to study the \nrelationship between finance and economic growth. Moving beyond existing literature, we \nhave considered a wide range of financial indicators, accounting both for the size and the \nquality of financial intermediation; focused on two important sources of GDP growth: \nphysical capital accumulation, and total factor productivity growth; and investigated whether \nthe relationship between our financial indicators and growth has changed over time, and \nwhether it differs across provinces characterized by different FDI stock to GDP ratios.  \n                                                                                                                                                        \nare 15 times higher, and their growth over the period 2001-2002 was almost 5 times faster than those of the 100 \npercent domestically owned private firms. This evidence is consistent with our hypothesis that those private \nfirms that enter joint-ventures with foreign firms are able to bypass the costs associated with an inefficient \nbanking sector in China, and can consequently achieve higher productivity and growth rates. \n35 In column 2 of Table 6, which reports the estimates for capital accumulation, we can see that while the Family \n1 indicators do not attract statistically significant coefficients, their interactions with the FDI stock to GDP ratio \nattract negative and precisely determined coefficients. This finding can be explained by the fact that FDI-\nfinanced projects may be driven more by a logic of efficiency than by a logic of spending. Consequently, FDI \nabundant environments may promote less disbursement-driven investment, reducing the rhythm of capital \naccumulation. \n36 One could claim that instead of being driven by FDI being a major source of financing, our results may be \ndriven by it being an indicator of more market based or reformed provinces. In order to assess whether this is the \ncase, we replaced the FDI stock variable with the share of state units in investment (STATE ENTITIES) as an \ninteraction term for our financial development indicators. The results, which are not reported for brevity, show \nthat these new interaction terms are generally insignificant, suggesting that our results based on the FDI \ninteractions do not stem from the fact that FDI is an indicator of more reformed provinces. \n37 Alfaro et al. (2004), Durham (2004), and Hermes and Lensink (2003) use cross-country data to look at the \nother side of the coin: they examine the extent to which the effects of FDI on growth depend on the countries\u2019 \nlevel of financial development. They find that it is only countries with well-developed financial markets that gain \nsignificantly from FDI. They argue that the lack of development of local financial markets can limit the \neconomy\u2019s ability to take advantage of potential FDI spillovers. In contrast, we show that, in the Chinese \ncontext, it is financial distortions at home that may lead domestic firms to establish joint-ventures with foreign \nfirms. \n 26\nWe found that traditionally used indicators of financial development and China-\nspecific indicators measuring the level of state interventionism in finance are generally \nnegatively associated with growth and its sources, while indicators measuring the degree of \nmarket driven financing in the economy tend to promote GDP and TFP growth, as well as \ncapital accumulation. This suggests that financial distortions do represent an impediment to \ngrowth.  \nIn order to explain how, in spite of the distortions, China managed to sustain \nphenomenal growth rates, we showed that the adverse effects of financial distortions on \ngrowth have gradually declined over time, probably due to the progressive restructuring of the \nbanking sector in China. We also showed that these effects tend to be weaker for high FDI \nrecipients, suggesting that FDI may be used to alleviate the costs associated with the \ninefficient banking sector: private firms, which are generally discriminated against by the \nlocal financial system, might be able to use foreign joint-ventures as sources of finance, and \nmight consequently achieve higher productivity and growth rates. FDI could therefore \nprovide an explanation for why, as discussed by Allen at al. (2005), China is a counter-\nexample to the findings of the finance-growth literature, being characterized by \nmalfunctioning financial institutions and phenomenal growth rates. It is obviously also \npossible that growth has been so high in China despite the poorly performing banking sector, \nbecause private firms were able to make use of alternative mechanisms such as internal \nfinance, non-bank financial intermediaries, and coalitions of various forms among firms; \ninvestors, and local governments. Yet, whichever the explanation for the Chinese growth \nmiracle, we can conclude that there are indeed circumstances under which financial \ndistortions do not represent an impediment to growth in China after all. \nMore insights on the link between financial development and growth in China can be \nderived from a comprehensive firm-level study of the determinants of firms\u2019 growth, with \nparticular emphasis on whether this growth is constrained by the quantity of internal finance \nand the types of external finance available to firms. This is on the agenda for future research. \n \nAppendix 1: Definition of the variables and statistical sources  \nMost data on the banking and financial sector for Chinese provinces are taken from the annual \nissues of the \u201cAlmanac of China\u2019s Finance and Banking\u201d (ACFB). Data on growth and its \ncomponents as well as data on our control variables are taken from annual issues of the China \nStatistical Yearbook (CSY) and from two statistical books that provide data at the provincial \nlevel from 1978 onwards (\u201cChina Regional Economy, a Profile of 17 Years of Reform and \n 27\nOpening Up\u201d issued by the China Statistical Bureau, CRE, and \u201c1949-1999 China Statistical \nData Compilation\u201d issued by the China Marketing Research, CMR). This Appendix provides \nthe exact definition (and the source, in parentheses) for each indicator used as explained or \nexplanatory variables in our regressions. All our variables are measured at the province level. \n \nExplained variables \nGDP per capita and GDP GROWTH: logarithm of real GDP per capita and annual growth \n(deflation based on annual CPI) (source: CSY). \nCAPITAL GROWTH: annual growth of real per capita capital stock (deflation based on annual \nCPI). The capital stock is computed based on the perpetual inventory method with a \ndepreciation rate of five percent. The initial capital stock is computed following Harberger\u2019s \n(1978) assumption of a steady-state capital-output ratio in 1974. Investment flows are real \ninvestments in fixed assets (source: CSY). \nTFP GROWTH: annual growth of per capita TFP, computed following Equation (1) in the \ntext.  \n \nExplanatory variables \nFinancial indicators: \nFamily 1: Size of financial sector \nBANK CREDIT: ratio of total bank loans to GDP (source: ACFB) \nTOTAL CREDIT: ratio of total loans (in bank and non-bank financial institutions) to GDP \n(source: ACFB) \nSAVINGS: ratio of households\u2019 savings deposits in financial intermediaries relative to GDP \n(source: CMR and CSY). \n \nFamily 2: State-related misallocation of funds \nSOCB CREDIT share: share of state-owned commercial banks in total credit (source: ACFB).  \nSOCB CREDIT to GDP: ratio of state-owned commercial banks\u2019 credit to GDP (source: \nACFB). \nCENTRAL: ratio of loans to deposits of the state-owned banks (source: ACFB). \n \nFamily 3: Profit-driven allocation of funds \nLOANSoverAPPRO: share of fixed asset investment financed by domestic loans relative to \nthat financed by state budgetary appropriation (source: CSY and CMR). \n 28\nSELF-RAISED FUNDS: share of fixed asset investment financed by self-raised funds (source: \nCSY and CMR). \n \n Control variables: \nEDUCATION: Share of population with more than primary schooling (source: CSY) \nCPI: Inflation rate based on the CPI (source: CSY) \nSTATE ENTITIES: Share of state entities in total investment in fixed assets (source: CSY) \nGOV: Government expenditure over GDP (source: CRE) \nOPENNESS ratio: ratio of exports plus imports to GDP (source: CSY) \nFDI\/GDP: ratio of foreign direct investment inflows to GDP (source: CSY and authors\u2019 \ncomputation). FDI inflows are defined as the investments inside China by foreign enterprises \nand economic organizations or individuals (including overseas Chinese, compatriots from \nHong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, and Chinese enterprises registered abroad), following the \nrelevant policies and laws of China for the establishment of ventures exclusively with foreign \nown investment, Sino-foreign joint-ventures, and cooperative enterprises, or for co-operative \nexploration of resources with enterprises or economic organizations in China. It includes the \nre-investment by foreign entrepreneurs of profits gained from investment, as well as the funds \nthat enterprises borrow from abroad in the total investment of projects, which are approved by \nthe relevant department of the government. \n \nOther \nFDI stock\/GDP: ratio of foreign direct investment stock to GDP (source: CSY and authors\u2019 \ncomputation). The FDI stock is computed as the sum of the deflated FDI inflows, where the \nU.S. Department of Labor Producer Price Index for Capital Equipment is used as a deflator. \n \nList of provinces and municipalities \nBeijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Shanxi, Nei Monggol, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Shanghai, \nJiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, Jiangxi, Shandong, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, \nGuangxi, Hainan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, Xinjiang, Sichuan, \nChongqing. \n \nAppendix 2: Investigating the reverse causality issue: a Granger causality test \nTable A1 presents the estimates of Equation (10), which is aimed at assessing whether GDP \nGROWTH Granger causes FINANCE. \n 29\n \nAcknowledgements \nThe authors are grateful for comments received by two anonymous Referees, Irene Chen, \nShujie Yao; and the participants at presentations at the Bank of Spain, the Chinese Academy \nof Social Sciences, the LICOS Center for Transition Economies, the University of \nNottingham, the University of Bradford, the 18th UK Chinese Economic Association (CEA) \nConference; the 22nd Meeting of the European Economic Association; and the 2007 CEA \n(UK) and China Center for Economic Studies (CCES) joint International Conference on \nTransition and Development: Governance, Markets and Growth.

The Granger causality test examines the null hypothesis that each financial indicator is not Granger-caused by economic \ngrowth. The first test that we use is an F-test aimed at testing the hypothesis that the coefficients on the lags of GDP GROWTH are jointly equal to 0. Our second test is an incremental Sargan \ntest of the form: DRU = n(J1 \u2013 J2), where J1 denotes the J statistic for the restricted model; J2, the J statistic for the unrestricted model; and n, the number of observations. Under the null \nhypothesis that GDP GROWTH does not Granger cause FINANCE, DRU is asymptotically distributed as a \u03c72 with r degrees of freedom, where r is the number of restrictions (2 in our case).
