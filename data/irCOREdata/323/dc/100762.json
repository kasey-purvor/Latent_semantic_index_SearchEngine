When using a consistent set of physical inputs the deduced\nspectroscopic factors are consistent to within 15% for incident deuteron energies from 12 to 60 MeV. By\ncontrast, original analyses of many of these data quoted spectroscopic factors that differed by up to a factor of\n5. The present analysis provides an important reference point from which to assess the requirements of future\nspectroscopic analyses of transfer reactions measured in inverse kinematics using rare nuclei.\nDOI: 10.1103\/PhysRevC.69.064313 PACS number(s): 21.10.Jx, 24.50.1g, 27.20.1n\nThe ordering and occupancies of the single nucleon orbits\ninfluences the energies and angular momenta of low-lying\nquantum states of nuclei [1,2], as well as their decays and\nproduction rates in nuclear experiments and stellar environ-\nments [3]. Single-nucleon transfer reactions, such as d\n+A \u00de p+B and p+B \u00de d+A, probe the wave functions of\nthe transferred nucleon [1\u20136]. The overlap integral between\nthe wave function of one state in nucleus A and another in B\ndefines the theoretical spectroscopic factor for transfer be-\ntween these states [5,6]. The ratio of the corresponding mea-\nsured cross section divided by the cross section calculated\nfor unit spectroscopic factor provides its experimental coun-\nterpart.\nSpectroscopic information about the valence orbitals for\nunstable nuclei far from the valley of beta stability may lead\nto novel and surprising properties for the corresponding un-\nstable nuclear states [7,8]. Single-nucleon transfer and\nknockout experiments in inverse kinematics with rare nuclei\nas projectiles, provide the optimal way to study neutron- and\nproton-rich nuclei and their single-particle states [3,9\u201312].\nHowever, it is critical to understand the limitations of trans-\nfer reaction theories used to extract spectroscopic factors and\nto develop strategies to overcome them. Because data with\nrare isotope beams are limited, re-examining abundant and\nprecise measurements made with light-ion beams such as 12C\nand 13C, may better test the consistency of such analyses.\nTable I lists the past measurements of 12Csd , pd13Csg.s.d\nreaction at incident energy above 4 MeV and its inverse re-\naction, 13Csp ,dd12Csg.s.d [13\u201338]. Figure 1 shows the pub-\nlished spectroscopic factors (SF) of the p1\/2 neutron coupled\nto the 12C as a function of the equivalent incident deuteron\nenergy up to 70 MeV. The extracted values from\n12Csd , pd13Csg.s.d (closed points) and 13Csp ,dd12Csg.s.d\n(open points) reactions fluctuate from 0.3 to 1.4 with no\nevident correlation with incident energy. In some analysis,\nmultiple values were deduced from different optical model\nparameter sets or different theories; the higher values are\nshown for those cases as squares in Fig. 1. The dashed line\nmarks the theoretical prediction s0.62d of the Cohen and\nKurath shell model calculation [39].\nLarge uncertainties have been associated with the extrac-\ntion of spectroscopic factors from the sp ,dd and sd , pd trans-\nfer reactions [40]. Using consistency checks between inverse\nreactions involving sd-shell nuclei, for example, Endt [40]\nextracted an error of about 50% for individual spectroscopic\nfactors from sp ,dd and sd , pd reactions. Such large uncertain-\nties make it difficult to extract consistently meaningful em-\npirical spectroscopic factors that can be compared to theoret-\nical values.\nThe sensitivity of calculations to the optical model poten-\ntials assumed in the entrance and exit channels constitutes\nthe most significant problem in the extraction of spectro-\nscopic factors from DWBA analyses of transfer reactions [5].\nThe deduced spectroscopic factors are dependent on these\nchoices; thus, many have measured elastic scattering data at\nthe entrance and exit energies to fix the optical model param-\neters. Such data may be difficult to obtain at the desired\nenergy. Moreover, their use may introduce spurious energy\ndependences stemming from detailed coupled-channel or\ncompound resonance effects. Our analyses minimize the\nneed for such data and show that superior results can be\nachieved by the consistent use of reasonable global optical\npotentials.\nIn the following, we use phenomenological global\nnucleon optical potentials [41\u201346] and potentials based on\nmicroscopic methods, such as the Jeukenne-Lejeune-Mahaux\n(JLM) effective nucleon-nucleon interaction [47,48]. To as-\nsess the systematic uncertainties associated with the extrac-\ntion of spectroscopic factors, we analyze the angular distri-\nbutions of the differential cross section of the\n12Csd , pd13Csg.s.d reaction and of its inverse,\n13Csp ,dd12Csg.s.d. Using reasonable theoretical inputs, we\nextract a consistent value (to within 15%) for the spectro-\nscopic factor of the p1\/2 neutron coupled to the 12Csg.s.d over\nPHYSICAL REVIEW C 69, 064313 (2004)\n0556-2813\/2004\/69(6)\/064313(5)\/$22.50 \u00a92004 The American Physical Society69 064313-1\na wide range of incident energies from 12 to 60 MeV. The\nremaining variations in the spectroscopic factor may partly\nstem from uncertainties in the measured differential cross\nsections.\nFirst, we focus on the 12Csd , pd angular distributions,\nshown in Fig. 2, that have been measured at incident energies\nranging from 7 MeV to 56 MeV. Each distribution is offset\nby factors of 10 from the neighboring distributions for ease\nof presentation, the overall normalization factor being unity\nfor the 19.6 MeV angular distribution. The spectroscopic\nfactor is extracted by fitting the theory to the data at the first\npeak in the angular distribution, since the backward angle\ndata are more sensitive to the effects of inelastic couplings\nand other higher-order effects. To be consistent, the spectro-\nscopic factors are extracted by minimizing x2, including only\nangular points that are (i) within 30% of the predicted maxi-\nmum yield and (ii) at uc.m.,30\u00b0. A similar analysis is also\nperformed on data from the inverse reaction of\n13Csp ,dd12Csg.s.d for proton incident energies ranging from\n35 to 65 MeV [35\u201338].\nOur calculations analyze all data sets in a consistent way\nand use a modified version of the code TWOFNR [49]. All\ncalculations make the local energy approximation (LEA) for\nfinite range effects [50] using the zero-range strength sD0d\nand range sbd parameters of the Reid soft-core 3S1\u2013 3D1\nneutron-proton interaction [51]. The 1p1\/2 neutron binding\npotential had radius parameter 1.25 fm and diffuseness\n0.65 fm; variations of 5% in the radius and diffuseness\ncaused 5% and 3% variations in the extracted spectroscopic\nfactors, respectively. The depth of the potential is normalized\nto the experimental binding energy. For simplicity, no spin-\norbit coupling is included in the calculations. Inclusion of the\nspin-orbit potential increases the spectroscopic factors by\nabout 6\u20138 %. Nonlocality corrections [52] with range pa-\nrameters of 0.85 and 0.54 are included in the proton and\ndeuteron channels, respectively.\nWe calculate the transfer cross sections within the\nJohnson-Soper (JS) adiabatic approximation to the neutron,\nproton, and target three-body system [53], which includes the\neffects of break up of the deuteron in the field of the target,\nand requires only a specification of the nucleon-target inter-\nactions. The exact sd , pd and sp ,dd transfer reaction ampli-\ntudes require knowledge of the adiabatic three-body wave\nfunction only at small neutron-proton separations. There, the\nadiabatic distorting potential governing the center-of-mass\nmotion of the deuteron is well described by the sum of the\nTABLE I.

It is impor-\ntant to stress that this adiabatic distorting potential generates\nthe three-body wave function in that limited region of con-\nfiguration space needed to evaluate the transfer amplitude. It\ndoes not describe deuteron elastic scattering at the beam en-\nergy.\nWe first perform sd , pd calculations where both the exit\nchannel proton potential and the entrance channel JS adia-\nbatic potential use the JLM nucleon-target optical potentials\n[54]. These are calculated by folding the density-dependent\nJLM nucleon-nucleon effective interaction [47,48], assumed\nto have a Gaussian form factor of range 1 fm [55], with the\nassumed target matter density in the midpoint local-density\napproximation [55]. The matter density distributions for both\n12C and 13C are evaluated assuming the modified oscillator\ndensity parameters (a=1.247, a=1.649 fm for 12C; a\n=1.403, a=1.635 fm for 13C) compiled in Ref. [56]. The\ncorresponding root-mean-square (rms) charge radii are\n2.46 fm and 2.44 fm for 12C and 13C, respectively. The real\nand imaginary parts of the calculated nucleon optical poten-\ntials were scaled by multiplicative factors lv=1.0 and lw\n=0.8, obtained from a systematic study of light nuclei [54].\nThe calculated angular distributions normalized by the ex-\ntracted spectroscopic factors are shown as solid lines in Fig.\n2. The associated spectroscopic factors, shown at the bottom\nof Fig. 3, include reanalyses of the data in Fig. 1 (closed\ncircles) [17,22,23,27\u201329,31,33] and of additional data sets\n(closed squares) [18,20,21,26,28]. Above 35 MeV, we\nsupplement the limited sd , pd data with 13Csp ,dd data\n[35\u201338] denoted by the open symbols in Figs. 1 and 3. We\ndid not analyze data at Ed=28 [30] and 56 MeV [34], and at\nEp=65 MeV [38] because those angular distributions did not\ninclude the first peak.\nThe rise of the spectroscopic factors with decreasing en-\nergy below 12 MeV shown in Fig. 3 has been observed be-\nfore [23] and has been attributed to the effect of resonance\nstructures in the elastic scattering of deuterons [57] and the\n12Csd , pd reactions [58]. Excluding measurements affected\nby compound nucleus formation and resonances, the spectro-\nscopic factors deduced for Ed=12\u201360 MeV provide an aver-\nage spectroscopic factor of 0.61\u00b10.09. In contrast, the pub-\nlished values in Fig. 1 vary from 0.3 to 1.5. Our consistent,\ntheoretically motivated analyses reduce the fluctuations sub-\nstantially. If we examine the spread of the measurements for\noverlapping sets of data at Ed,4.5,12, and 15 MeV, it is\nclear that the measured angular distributions do not agree to\nbetter than 20%. Thus the uncertainties of the spectroscopic\nfactors mainly come from the experimental measurements.\nTo assess the stability of the above adiabatic three-body\nmodel calculations, we have repeated these analyses while\nreplacing the JLM nucleon optical potentials everywhere by\nthe Chapel-Hill (CH) [43] global potential set. The spectro-\nscopic factors are shown in the center of Fig. 3. Overall, the\nvalues are quite similar, but are consistently somewhat\nhigher. The average spectroscopic factor is 0.75\u00b10.10.

A consistent use of\nalternative global nucleon potentials, such as that of Bec-\nchetti and Greenlees [44] leads to very similar results.\nFor a final comparison, we also analyzed the full data set\nwithin the DWBA formalism, neglecting the role of deuteron\nbreak-up channels. To remove energy-dependent optical po-\ntential ambiguity, we used the CH and Daehnick [45] global\npotentials for the proton and deuteron channels, respectively.\nThe calculated angular distributions normalized by the spec-\ntroscopic factors are shown by the dashed curves in Fig. 2\nand the deduced spectroscopic factors are plotted at the top\nof Fig. 3. The average value is 0.87\u00b10.19. For the higher\nenergies, the values are larger. Comparisons with the JS adia-\nbatic calculations suggest that neglect of the break-up chan-\nnel within the DWBA may be a significant contributing fac-\ntor at these higher energies.\nIn summary, published analyses of angular distributions\nfor the 12Csd , pd13Csg.s.d and 13Csp ,dd12Csg.s.d reactions\ndisplay considerable variations in the extracted spectroscopic\nfactors. Using consistent optical potential parametrizations\nand fitting the first maximum in the angular distributions\nprovide spectroscopic factors that are consistent to within\n15% for Ed=12\u201360 MeV. This energy range spans the opti-\nmum angular and linear momentum matching conditions for\nsd , pd and sp ,dd transfer reaction studies. The use of global\noptical potentials or the JLM potential parametrization re-\nsults in consistent values for the spectroscopic factor at each\nenergy; the absolute values depend somewhat on the choice\nof potentials used but the values are close to the theoretical\nvalues suggesting that the input parameters we use in the\ndistorted wave theory calculations are reasonable.\nThe global parametrization of the optical model potentials\nrequires the minimum input parameter choice and may be\nadvantageous where it is not important to extract the absolute\nspectroscopic factors. These global parametrizations, how-\never, are fitted only to data from stable nuclei. In neutron and\nproton-rich regions of the nuclear chart, the use of micro-\nscopic optical potentials like the JLM, but folded with\nHartree-Fock matter densities for the relevant nuclei may\noffer a more realistic alternative. The current analysis of\n12Csd , pd13C and 13Csp ,dd12C reactions provide a reference\npoint in the p-shell nuclei to which relative spectroscopic\nfactors can be measured. The input parameters, summarized\nin Table II, should be applicable to other systems. Future\nstudies of different systems are needed to guide the broadly\nbased programs to investigate the single particle structure of\nrare isotopes with the operation of current and future intense\nrare isotope facilities.\nThis work was supported by the National Science Foun-\ndation under Grant No. PHY-01-10253 and by the U.K. En-\ngineering and Physical Sciences Research Council through\nGrant No. GR\/M82141.\n[1] N.
