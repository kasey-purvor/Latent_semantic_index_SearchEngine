In particular, models for oxide nanoparticles were constructed using \nsimulated amorphisation and crystallisation and used to populate a library of oxide nanoparticles \n(amorphous and crystalline) with different radii. Nanoparticles were then taken from this library and \npositioned, within a specific volume, using Monte Carlo techniques, to facilitate a tight-packed \nstructure. The grain size distribution of the polycrystalline material was controlled by selecting \nparticular sized nanoparticles from the library. The (randomly oriented) grains facilitated a \npolycrystalline oxide, which comprised a network of general grain-boundaries. To help validate the \nmodel, gas diffusion through the (polycrystalline) oxide material was then simulated and the activation \nenergy calculated directly. Specifically, we explored He transport in UO2, which is an important \nmaterial with respect to both civilian and military applications. We found that He transport \nproceeds much faster through the grain-boundary and grain-junction network compared with \nintracrystalline UO2 regions, in accord with experiment. \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThe properties of a material are influenced profoundly by its microstructure, which includes, for \nexample, grain-boundaries, dislocations and point defects. Accordingly, if we are to generate \natomistic models, which are sufficiently realistic in that they can be used to directly calculate properties \nor simulate processes with sufficient accuracy to be of benefit to experiment, then a strategy for \nintroducing such microstructures into a model is required. Here, we present a general strategy for \nconstructing full atomistic models of polycrystalline materials with controllable grain-size distributions \nand defect concentration. Our atomistic model comprises general grain-boundaries, dislocations (screw, \nedge and mixed) and point defects. Moreover, all the microstructural features are introduced into a \nsingle atomistic model such that the model can be used to calculate properties or simulate process \ndirectly. In particular, the synergistic interactions between microstructural features and how much this \nmodifies the individual microstructures, is captured within the model. For example, the misfit strain \nenergy associated with (near coincident [1]) matching of two misaligned oxide grains to form a general \ngrain-boundary and how this impacts upon the atomistic structure of a neighbouring dislocation will be \nimplicit within the model. We develop the method for polycrystalline UO2 as a model system and \nexplore how the microstructure influences He diffusion. This will help validate the model because \nexperimental data pertaining to He diffusion in polycrystalline UO2 is available. \n \nUranium is an important material with respect to both civilian and military applications. However, a \nmajor challenge for this material is to ensure its safe storage. In particular, water (vapour) in the \nsurrounding air can adsorb onto the uranium surface forming hydrogen when it oxidises the \nuranium. This hydrogen forms uranium hydride UH3 which is pyrophoric [2,3]. When open to the \natmosphere, this reaction is an intermediate for the formation of UO2, recycling the hydrogen. \nConversely, when stored in a sealed canister, the uranium will consume all the oxygen (from air or \nvapour) for its oxidation, producing hydrogen gas, which can diffuse through the oxide layer, and \nreach the underlying metal, forming hydride. Without oxygen available, the system remains stable. \nConversely, the opening of the canister furnishes a large quantity of oxygen, which can react \ncatastrophically with the accumulated UH3 [4,5] causing a safety hazard. Clearly, an understanding \nof the structure and gas diffusion in UO2 is key to predict long-term storage properties. The diffusion \nof gas along grain boundaries can be many orders of magnitude higher compared with diffusion in \nthe bulk materials. Accordingly, if one is to calculate accurately gas diffusion, the atomistic model \nmust include structural defects including: grain-boundaries, dislocations, point defects.  \nExperiments, performed on uranium and its oxides, are expensive, dangerous and difficult and \ntherefore atomistic computer simulation offers a comparatively inexpensive and safe alternative. \nIndeed, UO2 has enjoyed much attention. Specifically, Catlow and co-workers explored the diffusion \nof neutral gas species, helium or xenon, which are sub-products from nuclear reactions, in the \ndefective form of the oxide UO2-x [6,7,8,9,10]. More recently, Price et al. explored diffusion along \nhigh-symmetry perfect grain-boundaries and calculated the diffusion coefficient along (110)\/(221) \n[11]. \n \nEarly studies of polycrystalline oxide materials considered high symmetry (twist\/twin) grain-\nboundaries in isolation [12,13,14,15], which were generated using symmetry operators acting upon the \ncrystal structure. The models were used to calculate diffusion coefficients and activation energies of \n(ionic) transport through boundary regions compared with mobility inside the grain. Model \npolycrystalline structures comprising general grain boundaries can also be generated using a \nVoronoi Construction, for example see ref. [16] This method also has the potential to control the size \ndistribution of grains by careful choice of grain centres. Later, approaches used by Philpot and co-\nworkers considered generating polycrystalline materials (bulk and thin film) using seeded \ncrystallization [17]. This approach also enabled a degree of control over the grain-size distribution and \nrelative orientation of the grains. Specifically, the grains were rotated about an axis normal to the \nsurface enabling the atomic planes to be parallel. Such \u201cevolutionary\" simulations [18] promise to \ndeliver more realistic models because they have the potential to capture within the model structural \nfeatures that evolve during a real crystallization. Similar to the seeded crystallisations performed by \nPhillpot and co-workers a \u201cSimulated amorphisation and crystallisation\" strategy was developed to \nfacilitate \u201cspontaneous\" crystallization [19]. Specifically, the strategy does not require (or indeed \nallow) the simulator to initiate or template the crystallisation using a precrystallised (artificial) \nnucleating seed; rather, the nucleating seed is allowed to spontaneously evolve, which was argued to be \nmore realistic than using an \u201cartificial\" nucleating seed. A drawback of this method is that the \nnucleating seed can take a long time to evolve or indeed may never evolve and therefore this method \nis computationally expensive. A strategy for generating models of nanomaterials by positioning \n(model) nanobuilding blocks at \u201ccrystallographic positions\u201d can be found in reference [20] and a \nreview of nanocrystalline materials in ref. [21] A definitive text exploring interfaces in crystalline \nmaterials is available [22]. \n \nOur aim is to generate general models of polycrystalline materials (bulk and thin film). To achieve \nthis we extended previous models. We generated oxide nanoparticles using simulated amorphisation \nand crystallisation. This was used to populate a library of oxide nanoparticles (amorphous and \ncrystalline) spanning various radii. Nanoparticles were then taken from this library and positioned \nwithin a specific volume using Monte Carlo (MC) techniques to facilitate a tight-packed structure. \nThe (randomly oriented) grains facilitated a polycrystalline oxide, which comprised a network of \ngeneral grain-boundaries. Gas diffusion through the (polycrystallise) oxide material was then \nsimulated and the activation energy calculated. Specifically, helium transport in UO2 was used as a \nmodel system. The chosen approach enables one to define the grain size distribution and defect \nconcentrations of the model, the latter includes for example, dislocations, grain-boundaries and point \ndefects. The approach comprises three steps: \n \n\u2022 Generate a library of model nanobuilding blocks; \n\u2022 Construct a nanopolycrystalline oxide with a pre-determined grain-size and defect distribu-\ntion by selecting specific nanobuilding blocks from the library; \n\u2022 Validate the method and test the structural model by simulating He diffusion in UO2.  \n \nMETHOD \nIn this section, we describe the potential models used to represent the interactions between atoms; \nthe strategy used to generate models of the UO2 nanoparticles that include microstructural features \nsuch as grain-boundaries, dislocations and point defects; the population of a database with atomistic \nmodels of UO2 nanoparticles and finally the packing of nanoparticles, taken from the library, to \nformulate models for a nanopolycrystalline bulk or thin film. \n \nAtomic Potentials \nWe used the DL_POLY code, which implements three-dimensional periodic boundary conditions, to \nperform all the molecular dynamical simulations in this study [23]. Effectively, the model for the \ncrystalline bulk extends infinitely in all three spatial directions. However a gap was introduced to \nrepresent the free surface associated with the nanopolycrystalline thin film. \n \nTo describe the interaction between oxygen and uranium atoms, a rigid-ion model based upon a \nfully ionic description developed by Walker and Catlow [Error! Bookmark not defined.], was used; \nparameters to describe He - UO2 interactions were taken from Grimes [9]. All the potential \nparameters used in this study are presented in table 1. We note that pseudo gas atoms (distinct \nfrom He and notated as PseudoGas in the present work) was used to impart pressure upon the \nsystem to promote crystallisation and therefore an arbitrary potential was employed. \u2018PseudoGas\u2019 atoms \nwere described wholly by a repulsive model, avoiding any possibility of the gas crystallising. \n \nTable 1 \nGenerating Nanoparticles \nIn this section, we develop a procedure for simulating the atomistic structure of UO2 nanoparticles. We \nthen use the method to populate a library of nanoparticles with different diameters; Nanoparticles \nof uranium oxides have been synthesised experimentally [24]. \n Generating the full atomistic structure of a model nanoparticle is not trivial - realistic atomistic \nstructures cannot easily be cut from the parent bulk material. For example, the morphological \nstructure will comprise many low-energy surfaces. And although there are many simulation codes \nthat use the crystal symmetry to generate an individual surface, for a nanoparticle one also needs to \nconsider the structure of edges (where a pair of surfaces meet) and vertices (where three or more \nsurfaces meet) together with the implications of dipolar surfaces and surface steps, corners and \nniche sites. In addition, for nanoparticles in excess of 10,000 atoms, the nanoparticles will likely \ncomprise dislocations or (general) grain-boundaries [25,26]. Simulation strategies, to generate the \nstructure of an individual dislocation or grain-boundary [27] within the bulk (perfect) material, are \navailable. However, introducing a dislocation into the polyhedral structure of a nanoparticle is more of \na challenge: Fabrication of a material experimentally inevitably involves some kind of crystallisation \nprocess. Indeed, crystallisation processes control the (micro) structure and hence the properties of the \nmaterial. Moreover, by modifying the crystallisation process (whether crystallisation from solution, \nvapour deposition, molecular beam epitaxy, ball milling etc.) one can exact some control over the \nmicrostructure and hence the properties of the material. We propose therefore that the easiest way of \ncapturing, within a single atomistic model, all the microstructural features observed experimentally, is to \nsimulate the crystallisation process itself. Indeed, there are many theoretical studies that attempt to \nsimulate the crystallization process. For example Piana and Gale performed some highly detailed MD \nsimulations on the growth and dissolution of urea crystals [28]. Similarly, Hamad et al. used MD to \nexplore the embryonic stages of ZnS nanobubbles [29]. These elegant dynamical atomistic \nsimulations capture many of the important structural features associated with the nucleation, growth \nand dissolution processes. Indeed, these approaches would prove ideal in generating models for \nnanoparticles. Unfortunately, these approaches would also prove computationally too expensive (at \npresent) to use to generate models for oxide nanoparticles comprising, for example, 50,000 atoms \ndirectly. Accordingly, we use simulated amorphisation\/melting and crystallisation. This method has \nbeen used previously to generate realistic models of fluorite-structured oxide nanoparticles in \nquantitative agreement with experiment [30,31] and therefore we have confidence in applying the \nstrategy to generate models of UO2 nanoparticles. \n \nAmorphisation \nTo amorphise\/melt a UO2 nanoparticle, we cut a cube comprising six {100} surfaces from the \nparent (fluorite-structured) material and tensioned the cube by 25% to effect amorphisation [32]. \nHowever, upon simulating the system using MD at high temperature, the simulations failed \ncatastrophically. It was determined that the surface dipoles (fluorite {100} are dipolar type III \nsurfaces [33]) together with the high configuration energy associated with corners and edges resulted \nin considerable forces acting upon surface atoms. Consequently, the atoms underwent enormous \naccelerations and were subsequently vaporized from the surface. To help quench the surface \ndipoles, a simple code to cleave the (dipolar) surfaces while maintaining stoichiometry (fig. 1) was \nwritten. Using these cleaved nanoparticles, MD simulation, performed at high temperature, was \nsuccessful in amorphising\/melting the nanoparticles without catastrophic failure. \n \nFig. 1 \n \nCrystallisation  \nThe next step was to crystallise the nanoparticle. Here, we applied MD simulation, performed at \nreduced temperatures, on the amorphous\/molten nanoparticles. We considered a variety of different \ntemperatures together with long (in this context nanosecond) running times. However, we were \nunsuccessful in facilitating crystallisation under such conditions. Accordingly, to increase the \nprobability of a nucleating seed spontaneously evolving within a nanoparticle, a high pressure was \nimposed upon the system, which facilitated the evolution of nucleating seeds. This strategy follows our \nprevious study on high-pressure crystallisation of TiO2 nanoparticles [34]. Specifically, pressure was \nimparted by introducing a hard sphere gas (PseudoGas) into the simulation box; potential parameters \nare given in table 1. The nanoparticles were successfully crystallised under high-pressure. \n \nPopulating a Library of Nanoparticles \nAmorphisation and crystallization was used to populate a library of UO2 nanoparticles comprising seven \nnanoparticle sizes: 110,571 atoms (14 nm), 26,364 atoms (9 nm), 8,748 atoms (6 nm), 6,144 atoms (5 \nnm), 2,592 atoms (4 nm), 1,500 atoms (3 nm) and 768 atoms (2.5 nm). The next step was to use the \nnanoparticles as (secondary) building blocks and aggregate them together to form \nnanopolycrystalline structures. \n \nGenerating atomistic models for nanopolycrystalline bulk and thin film \nSimulating (atomistically) the aggregation of several nanoparticles, each comprising up to 110,000 \natoms, proved computationally prohibitive using available computational facilities. Consequently, to \nreduce computational expense, each nanoparticle was represented by a sphere, which was centered \non the geometrical centre of the nanoparticle with a radius adjusted to enclose all the atoms \ncomprising the nanoparticle within a minimum volume. The spheres were then represented using a \nsimplified pair-potential, following equations (1), to reduce considerably the computational cost of \nsimulating the aggregation: \n \n1)()( 21\n1\n++\u2212\n\u00d7\n\u2212=\nRRd\nRR\ndU s\u03b1   d > (R1+R2)      \n          (1) \n\u221e=)(dU     d\u2264(R1+R2)  \n  \nwhere U (d) is the interaction energy, d is the interatomic separation between spheres 1 and 2, \u03b1 is \nan empirical coefficient, which was used to help increase the speed of the simulation and in this study \nwas set to 0.1. R1 and R2 are the radii of spheres 1 and 2 respectively. The numerator contains the \nproduct of the radii of the two spheres involved in this pair-potential, which was designed to reduce the \nattraction between small spheres. \n \nTo achieve a high packing density, spheres with particular sizes to effect a particular grain-size \ndistribution, were introduced randomly at the top or bottom of the simulation cell. Once inside the \nbox, the spheres feel the attractive influence of one another and MC was used to direct them into low \nenergy configurations. An additional potential, equation (2), was included to attract the spheres to a \nplane in the centre of the simulation cell: \n \nV(x,y,z) = -\u03b2|z|                                                                                     (2) \n \nwhere V(x,y,z) is the potential at a point (x,y,z) and \u03b2 an emprirical parameter. Here, we used \u03b2=4, \nwhich was sufficient to draw the nanoparticles close to the plane at the centre of the cell relatively \nquickly, but not too strong as to deleteriously influence the packing. When generating a model for a \npolycrystalline bulk, the simulation was stopped when the box was full, fig. 2. Similarly, when \nsimulating a model for a polycrystalline thin film, the simulation stopped and no further nanoparticles \nwere added upon reaching the desired film thickness. MC simulations were run typically, for about a \nmillion steps to facilitate close packed configurations. The spheres were then replaced by the \ncorresponding nanoparticles to obtain an atomistic model of a polycrystalline thin-film and \npolycrystalline bulk. A final, fully atomistic, MD simulation was performed on each system; pressure \nwas imposed to compact further the nanocrystals and help fill void space. For the polycrystalline thin-\nfilm pressure was imparted using PseudoGas atoms. \n \nFig. 2 \n \nHe diffusion in Nanopolycrystalline UO2 \nThe final step was to validate the atomistic models by simulating helium diffusion in polycrystalline \nUO2 using the model structures and comparing with experiment. To this end, He atoms were \nintroduced into the polycrystalline UO2 matrix. However, He atoms cannot be positioned at \nrandom into the matrix because they could inadvertently locate too close to oxygen or uranium \npositions, which would result in catastrophic failure of the MD simulation. To prevent this, we designed \na simple algorithm to position the gas atoms into the UO2 matrix. In particular, the algorithm searches \nfor a suitable space to position the gas atoms. To achieve this, a position was chosen at random and the \nnearest-neighbour atoms (as determined by a distance less than a predefined value) surrounding this \nposition are listed. The code then calculates the barycentre of these atoms. If all the atoms in the \nUO2 matrix and previously introduced He atoms are sufficiently far away from this point, a He \natom is added. By adjusting two parameters (nearest neighbour and distance from barycentre to \nnearest neighbour) we were able to control the introduction of the He into grain-boundary regions \nand\/or bulk crystalline regions. For example, inter-crystalline (grain boundary) regions are generally \nless dense than intra-crystalline regions. Once all the He atoms were introduced into the oxide matrix, \nmolecular dynamics (MD) was used to simulate the diffusion. The first step was a pseudo energy \nminimization; constant pressure MD was performed at 300 K, followed by equilibration to the desired \ntemperature. Specifically, NPT (constant Number of atoms, Pressure and Temperature) MD simulation  \nwith a Hoover barostat and thermostat was performed, for 10 ps at zero pressure; a small timestep (0.1 \nfs) was needed to facilitate system stability, which was followed by equilibration for 50 ps with a 3 fs \ntimestep. Once the potential energy associated with introducing the He had transformed to kinetic \nenergy and extracted by the thermostat, NVT (constant Number of particles, Volume, Temperature) \nMD simulations were performed at different temperatures to facilitate data points which could be \nfitted to an Arrhenius relationship. We note that the MD system was stable using a maximum \ntimestep of 3fs. \n \nRESULTS \nIn this section we describe a typical simulation that facilitated the successful generation of models of \noxide nano-crystals, we then present the atomistic structure of a range of nanocrystals. \n \nAmorphisation\/Melting \nA cube of fluorite-structured UO2, was cut (with {100} surfaces) from the parent bulk material and \ntensioned by 25%. This cube was then placed into a simulation box, with three-dimensional \nperiodic boundaries, which were sufficiently large to prevent any interaction between the atoms and \ntheir periodic images. The corners of the cube were cleaved to help reduce the surface dipoles (fig. \n3(a)). The nanoparticle comprised 8,788 uranium and 17,576 oxygen atoms. A PseudoGas was then \nintroduced to impart pressure upon the nanoparticle. Constant pressure MD simulation was performed at \n6,000 K under 20 GPa pressure for 500 ps, which resulted in an amorphous\/molten nanoparticle (figs. \n3(b) & 3(c)). Constant pressure and temperature was maintained using a Hoover thermostat and \nbarostat [35] with 1.0 ps relaxation times.  \n \nFig. 3 \n \nCrystallisation \nTo facilitate the crystallisation, the temperature was reduced to 3,000 K and constant pressure \nMD simulation was performed under 20 GPa pressure for 800 ps. The nanoparticle was then \ncooled; NVT MD simulation was performed at zero pressure (gas removed) at 300 K for 800 \nps, followed by NVT MD at 0 K; the latter acts effectively as a pseudo energy minimisation. The \nfinal model structure is shown in Figs. 3(d) & 3(e). This general procedure was then used to populate \nthe library of UO2 nanoparticles. \n \nHeat of Crystallisation \nThe configuration energy, calculated as a function of time during the crystallisation, is reported in Fig. \n4. Initially, the energy, associated with the amorphous configuration, drops as the nanoparticle \ncrystallises. Nucleating seeds spontaneously evolve within the amorphous nanoparticle and facilitate \ncrystallisation of the amorphous ions surrounding the seed, emanating radially from each seed. After \nall the amorphous ions have been consumed (fully crystallised), the gradient reduces. The energy \ndifference between the start and final configuration reflects, in part, the heat of crystallisation. We note \nthe sudden drop in energy near 200 ps was attributed the annihilation of grain boundary where two \nneighbouring grains sinter into a single grain. This was determined by observing an animation of the \nprocess, which was generated using molecular graphical techniques. We note that the energy \nassociated with the heat of crystallization was extracted via a thermostat to prevent the seed, which \nspontaneously evolves, from re-amorphising.  \n \nFig. 4 \n \nU-U and O-O Radial Distribution Functions (RDF) calculated for the starting, amorphous and final \nUO2 nanoparticle structure are shown in fig. 5. Inspection of the RDF trace reveals a crystalline \nstarting configuration, which then broadens, indicating no long range order - indicative of an \namorphous or molten material. The final RDF are much sharper than the amorphous material \nalthough not as sharp as the starting configuration. This is because the final structure includes: \nsurface (interface) relaxation, defects (vacancies\/interstitials) and extended defects including disloca-\ntions and grain-boundaries. The calculated RDF thus shows that the nanoparticle had amorphised \ncompletely with no residual crystallinity and successfully crystallised into the fluorite structure. The \nlattice parameter, captured from the RDF, is 5.34 \u00c5, which is within 3% of experiment (5.47 \u00c5 at \n298 K) [36]). We note that the O-O RDF is consistent with Catlow [Error! Bookmark not defined.] and more \nrecent work [37] who predicted that UO2 was superionic. Molecular graphical techniques were then \nused to examine in more detail, the structural features. \n \nFig. 5 \n \nAtomistic Structure \nAnalysis of the atomistic structures revealed that the UO2 had crystallised into the fluorite structure; \nexperimentally, crystalline UO2 nanoparticles with fluorite structure have been observed [38]. The \nstructures of a variety of nanoparticles as a function of size are shown in table 2. Fig. 6 shows the \nmorphological structure and microstructural features of four UO2 nanoparticles, which are about 9 \nnm in diameter. Inspection of these nanoparticles reveal morphologies similar to the \u2019truncated \noctahedral\u2019 morphology of CeO2 nanoparticles [31,32]. Specifically, {111} surfaces, which are the \nlowest energy surface [39], dominate the morphology, and are truncated by {100} surfaces, which, for \nfluorite-structured materials, are dipolar type (III). Here the surface dipole has been quenched via a \nrearrangement of atoms at the surface [33], fig. 6. Similar reconstructions have been observed previously \nin CeO2 nanocrystals [32], Some nanoparticles present only {111} surfaces, fig. 7, although we \nnote that they are not monocrystals. \n \nTable 2 \n \nFig. 6 \n \nFig. 7 \n \nWe note that the nanocrystals in fig. 6 are structurally non-identical yet were generated using identical \nsimulation methodologies. This illustrates the random nature associated with the structure and \nevolution of nucleating seeds that spontaneously evolve. Specifically, the simulator does not have any \ninfluence over the structure; rather they evolve in a \u2018natural\u2019 way, which is a designed feature of the \nsimulation strategy to help to generate more realistic models. In particular, the amorphisation & \ncrystallisation strategy can be used to simulate structural distributions of nanoparticles that one would \nexpect to observe experimentally. In addition, the model nanoparticles generated present several types \nof grain boundary and defect including: twin grain boundaries, fig. 8, fig. 9, screw dislocations, fig. 9, \nedge dislocations, fig. 8 and pinning defects, fig. 10. \n \nFig. 8 \n \nFig. 9 \n \nFig. 10 \n \nWe also examined nucleating seed growth using molecular graphics. In particular, we observed that \nthe nucleating seeds evolved at the surface of the nanocrystal exposing {111}. The seed then \nfacilitated crystallisation, which emanated radially from the core, fig. 11. The figure also reveals two \ncrystalline seeds, which evolve during the same time frame. It is interesting to note that the two \ngrains reorient themselves prior to grain boundary formation, presumably to facilitate a higher \nsymmetry twin boundary resulting in an energetically more stable structure. Specifically a twin \nboundary is energetically more stable than a lower symmetry general grain boundary because the \nlatter is necessarily associated with a lattice misfit. \n \nMolecular graphics was then used to examine the structure of the grain-boundary between two \nmiss-oriented grains within a 9 nm nanoparticle and is shown in fig. 12(a). The grain boundary is \nclearly visible in the middle of the structure. To aid understanding, the volume occupied by the \natoms have been calculated using a Connoly surface algorithm and reveals a reduced density of ions \nnear the grain boundary in accord with grain-boundaries observed experimentally. We propose that a \nreduced ion density at boundary regions facilitates facile diffusion of helium, thus providing a \npathway for helium transport. In the final section of this study, we will test this hypothesis by \nsimulating He diffusion and linking He transport pathways with the atomistic structure and local \nionic densities at boundary regions. \n \nNanopolycrystalline Structure \nOnce the library of nanoparticle models had been populated, the nanoparticle models were used to \ngenerate models for a nanopolycrystalline UO2 thin film and a nanopolycrystalline UO2 bulk. \nComputational facility limitations prevented us from using nanoparticles larger than 5 nm. However, \nthe ability to explore polycrystalline materials with distributions comprising larger grain-sizes will be \nmet in the future as computational facilities increase. \n \nFor the thin film, thirteen nanoparticles were introduced into the simulation cell, table 3. \nPseudoGas atoms were also introduced into the simulation cell to conduct the pressure. NPT MD \nsimulation was then performed at 3,000 K for 392 ps at 5 GPa pressure. A segment of the thin film \nwith surrounding gas atoms is shown in fig. 13. For the bulk system, twenty one nanoparticles filled \nthe simulation cell and NPT MD simulation was performed under 5 GPa pressure at 2000 K for 733 \nps. The system was then cooled to room temperature; zero pressure MD simulation was performed \nfor 50 ns at 300 K. \n \nTable 3 \n \nFig. 11 \n \nFig. 12 \n \nFig. 13 \nThin Film \nInspection of the final nanopolycrystalline thin film structure, figs. 13, 14, reveals that it is similar \nto the starting configuration, but with the voids between the nanoparticles compacted. One can \nobserve, fig. 13, that the larger grains are still present. However, some of the smaller grains have been \nconsumed by sintering into a larger grain. It is also clear from the models that the intersection of \nmultiple (miss-oriented) nanoparticles facilitates models of general grain-boundaries, which are \nimportant features. In particular, it is likely that He will diffuse predominantly along general grain-\nboundaries. We also note that some of the gas atoms are trapped inside the polycrystalline slab, fig. \n13(c). This is a valuable feature of our model because nanopolycrystalline materials, such as UO2 \nincorporate voids within their structure and will likely influence the transport of gas atoms. Our \nstrategy therefore facilitates the introduction of such voids into the atomistic model.  \n \nFig. 14 \n \nBulk \nSimilar to the thin film, the model for polycrystalline bulk UO2, fig. 15, comprises a variety of \nmiss-oriented grains, separated by general grain boundaries and grain junctions, fig. 16. In addition, \nmicrostructural features include dislocations and point defects including vacancies. \n \nFig. 15 \n \nDiffusion \nThe models of polycrystalline structures, generated above, enable the activation energy for gas \ndiffusion in a material containing a rich variety of defects to be calculated directly. In this section, \nwe simulate He diffusion using the model of the polycrystalline bulk, fig. 15. The trajectories of the \nHe atoms, calculated during MD simulation performed at 1200 K, are presented in Fig. 17. \nInspection of the data, reveals fast moving He ions, which traverse through the structure along grain-\nboundary regions. Conversely, those He ions within UO2 crystalline grain interiors are comparatively \nimmobile and remain trapped throughout the duration of the MD simulation.  \n \nFig. 16 \n \nFig. 17 \n \nThe activation energy, associated with He diffusion, was calculated to be 0.2 eV and was extracted \nfrom the MSD data by fitting to a Arrhenius relationship following ref. [40] \n \nDiscussion \nAs the grain size increases, so the grain\/grain-boundary (volume) ratio decreases [41]. Transport \nprocesses such as diffusion can be influenced by many factors including: grain boundaries, voids, \ndefects, dislocations. Accordingly, if one is to calculate diffusion through a polycrystalline material \ndirectly, then the atomistic model needs to include all these structural features, including their \nsynergy of interaction. Here, our atomistic models, fig. 15, are similar to those observed in \npolycrystalline UO2 by Roudil and co-workers [42] although we note that the individual grain sizes \nwithin our models are smaller than experiment. \n \nPreviously Kadau and co-workers have generated polycrystalline materials by assembling spherical \nnanoparticles and compressing them into a close packed configuration [43]. Our study extends \nthis approach to include oxide nanoparticles. In addition, the nanoparticles used in this present \nstudy are more realistic in that they comprise a variety of microstructural features including dis-\nlocations, point defects, grain-boundaries, surface morphology including dipolar surface recon-\nstructions. Accordingly, our strategy enables one to fine-tune the defect character. For example, \nif one desired a polycrystalline material with a high dislocation content, one could select nanoparticles \nfrom the library, which comprised dislocations traversing through their structure, rather than choosing \nfrom the library single crystal nanoparticles. \n \nComputational limitations preclude simulating microscopic grains. Typically we would need to \ninclude billions of atoms. Nevertheless, we have captured, within a single structural model, all the \nimportant structural features observed experimentally including: miss-oriented crystalline grains \nseparated by grain-boundaries and triple junctions, dislocations and point defects, which enables us to \nsimulate He diffusion directly. As computational resources continue to increase in the future, it will be \npossible to construct models of polycrystalline materials with wider grain size distributions and \ncomprising larger grains. Specifically, in this study we were not able to use 6, 9 and especially 14 \nnm UO2 nanoparticles.  \n \nWe used a rigid ion model to simulate the diffusion of He in UO2, which includes transport through, \nfor example, grain-boundary regions and in close proximity to vacancies and dislocations. Clearly, \nsuch defects will impact upon the polarisation of the He and therefore it is desirable to use the shell \nmodel [44]. However, accommodating all the important microstructural features within a single sim-\nulation cell including their synergy of interactions to enable He transport to be simulated directly, \nnecessitated a large simulation cell. Typically each diffusion simulation required 7 days using 128 \nprocessors (Intel\u00ae Xeon\u00ae 5160 (3.0 Ghz) Quad-Cores). Introducing the shell model would, we \nestimate, require one to two orders of magnitude more cpu, which is prohibitive at present; rather the \nfocus of this present study was the development of a simulation strategy to explore gas diffusion directly \nin a full microstructural model together with model validation using the He\/UO2 system. Moreover, the \nactivation energy barrier associated with He migration between interstitial sites via an oxygen or \nuranium vacancy was calculated to be 0.38 and 0.24 eV respectively using a shell-model description \n[9], which are similar to 0.2 eV calculated in this present study.  \n \nThe calculated activation energy barriers are about ten times lower than that measured by Roudil \nand coworkers, who determined a value of 2 eV [42]. However, we note that Helium diffusion is \nmeasured using nuclear reaction analysis [45], which is not instantaneous and therefore cannot be \nconducted immediately after Helium implantation. Accordingly, only intragranular He would be \nmeasured experimentally using this technique because He present in grain-boundary regions would be \nlost owing to the (expected) much higher diffusion rate in these regions. Indeed, Guilbert and co-\nworkers, in developing mathematical models to describe the diffusion, required the introduction of \nan additional component into the model to account for a \u2018fast\u2019 diffusion process. In particular, they \nproposed two hypotheses to explain the data: the influence of surface pores or intergranular diffusion. \nThe latter, grain-boundary diffusion, \u2018would proceed at a far greater rate than (intragranular) \ndiffusion\u2019 [46]. The work of Sauvage and co-workers [47] also highlights the importance of grain \nboundaries in the diffusion. Their analysis of the UO2 system is compatible with the fast release of \nHe through grain boundaries, together with slow intragranular diffusion. \n \nIntragranular diffusion of He in UO2 was calculated by Catlow and co-workers in 1990 to be \n3.8 eV [9] using atomistic simulation and more recently 2.97 eV using density functional theory [48]; a \nvalue of 2.09 eV was determined using the thermally expanded lattice parameter of UO2 at 1200K. \nPrice calculated He diffusion along [321]-[221] Grain boundaries [11] and although this represented a \nvaluable extension to intergranular diffusion, \u2018real\u2019 diffusion will involve He mobility along a \nvariety of (general) grain-boundaries. Our model better captures this behaviour because our \ncalculated activation energy barrier is a sum over all the He atoms, which diffuse along various \n(dissimilar) general grain-boundaries.  \n \nCONCLUSION \nWe have developed a general strategy for simulating gas diffusion in nanopolycrystalline materials \nincluding bulk and thin film. In particular, we generated models for UO2 nanoparticles using \nsimulated amorphisation and crystallisation. Specifically, a nanoparticle is first amorphised and at a \nparticular instance in time during the MD simulation, an amorphous crystalline seed spontaneously \nevolves in the amorphous nanocrystal, which nucleates crystallisation. In this study we crystallised the \nnanoparticles at high pressure to increase the probability of a nucleating seed evolving. This resulted \nin several nucleating seeds evolving within a single nanoparticle. Accordingly, as each seed \npropagated crystallisation, the crystallisation fronts impinged upon one another facilitating the \nevolution of grain-boundaries within the (single) nanoparticle. \n \nThis amorphisation and crystalisation strategy enables a variety of important microstructural features \nto be introduced into the model including, for example: (general) grain-boundaries, screw, edge and \nmixed screw-edge dislocations, point defects, including vacancies which pin the dislocations, \nnanocrystal morphologies including surfaces exposed (we observe UO2{111}, UO2{100}) the \natomistic structures of edges and corners, together with surface steps, ledges and niche sites. Such \nmicrostructural features are difficult to introduce into a structural model using alternative means, for \nexample with symmetry operators.  \n \nThis method was then used to populate a library of UO2 nanoparticles with different radii. \nNanoparticles were taken from this library and positioned, within a specific volume using  Monte \nCarlo techniques, to facilitate tight-packed structures. The (randomly oriented) nanoparticles \nfacilitated a polycrystalline UO2 matrix, which comprised a network of general grain-boundaries. \n \nThis general strategy facilitates the generation of atomistic models of (nano)polycrystalline \nmaterials with a predefined grain size distribution by taking the component grains from a library of \nmodel nanocrystals. The model of polycrystalline UO2 was then used to simulate He transport through \nthe material. The simulations enabled a direct calculation of the activation energy for gas diffusion in a \nmaterial comprising a large range of defects. \n \nAnimations (ion trajectories during the MD simulation) of the He diffusing through the UO2 matrix \nrevealed that He transport through the material proceeds fastest via (general) grain-boundary regions \nrather than intragranular regions and is associated with an activation energy barrier of 0.2eV. \n \nAcknowledgement \nThis work was supported by AWE.
