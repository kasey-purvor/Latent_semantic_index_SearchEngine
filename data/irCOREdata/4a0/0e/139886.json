However, as far as can be ascertained most of the laboratory research on\nerosion resistance of the coatings has been conducted on the coatings in the as-received\ncondition. The effect of service conditions on the erosion rate of the coatings has not been\naddressed. This paper looks at the effects of thermal aging on the erosion rate of electron beam\nphysical vapour deposited thermal barrier coatings (EB-PVD TBCs) by testing the erosion\nresistance of coatings that have received various different heat treatments and comparing them\nto those in the as received condition.\nInitially two different aging heat treatments were used 1500\u00b0C for 24hrs, aimed at sintering the\nceramic columns, and a less severe aging of 1100\u00b0C for 100hrs. It was found that both of the\nheat treatments resulted in a significant increase in the erosion rates when compared to the as\nreceived samples. Subsequent to the initial tests, it was found that heat treating the TBC for 30\nhours at 1100\u00b0C resulted in an insignificant increase in the erosion rate. For the samples given\nthe higher temperature heat treatment, the increase in the erosion rate was attributed to the fact\nthat the columns were partially sintering together which enabled cracks to propagate into\nneighbouring columns, as opposed to stopping at column boundaries as\n2occurs in samples that have not been heat treated. This results in an increase in erosion rate due\nto the fact that more material is removed per impact event.\nIntroduction\nThe erosion of thermal barrier coatings has been well documented for both air plasma sprayed\n(APS) and electron beam (EB) physical vapour deposited (PVD) thermal barrier coatings\n(TBCs) [1-8]. Work has also been carried out on the erosion mechanisms[2,9] and on modelling\nthe erosion of EB PVD TBCs[10]. But most of this work has been conducted on coatings in the\nas received condition. However, one question that has been frequently asked and which has yet\nto be answered is: How does the erosion rate of an EB-PVD TBC change due to ageing in a gas\nturbine engine? Recent work by Janos et al[1 1] looked at the effect of thermal aging and\nporosity levels on the erosion rates of APS TBCs. It was found that both the erosion resistance\nand the microhardness of the TBCs increased with an increasing aging temperature (for a\nconstant porosity) and decreased with increasing porosity. This increase in hardness and erosion\nresistance was attributed to the onset of sintering which strengthened the structure of the TBC,\nparticularly the inter-splat cohesion. This paper looks at the effect of ageing and sintering\ntreatments on the room temperature erosion rate of EB PVD TB Cs, thus complimenting the\nwork done by Janos et al [11].\nTwo different sets of ageing times and temperatures were used on different types of specimens,\nas listed in Table 1 and 2. The samples were all coated with a standard ZrO2-8wt% Y2O3, by the\nEB-PVD technique.\nOf the four samples on the alloy substrate two were tested in the as received condition, as\nreference samples, while the other two were heat treated for 100 hours at 1100\u00b0C to simulate\n3service temperatures, samples 3 and 4. In the second set of tests, EB PVD TBCs were deposited\nonto alumina and zirconia; one was aged at 1100\u00b0C for 30hrs, sample 12, the second was aged\nat 1100\u00b0C for 100hr, sample 11, a third was heat treated at 1500\u00b0C for 24 and one was kept as a\nreference sample.\nAnother aspect that needs to be addressed is the role of sintering, associated with densification of\nthe TBC surface due to the much higher temperatures expected in this region as a result of the\nthermal gradient across the coating in service, and to what degree it will affect erosion rates. To\nthis end, initially four samples were coated with a standard EB PVD PSZ. Two were alumina\nsubstrates and two were zirconia substrates and these were then heat treated for 24 hrs at\n1500\u00b0C, in order to ensure sintering of the columns at the sample surface. After the heat\ntreatment these samples were found to have bowed significantly with the TBC on the concave\nside in all cases, as illustrated in Figure 1. As this was not expected, it was decided to subject\nuncoated, otherwise identical, alumina and zirconia tiles to the same heat treatment. The\nuncoated samples came out of the heat treatment without curvature indicating that the curvature\nmust be due to an interaction between the coating and substrate arising from the sintering\nprocess.\nThe radius of curvature, of four of the samples that were heat treated for 24hrs at 1500\u00b0C, was\nmeasured using a Dektak3 ST surface profilometer the results of which are given in Table 3.\nEach sample was measured in two orthogonal directions, and as can be seen from the results and\nthe micrograph, Figure 1, the alumina sample, on the right, has a significantly smaller radius of\ncurvature than the zirconia sample.\nThese results show that during the 1 500\u00b0C\/24h anneal significant lateral shrinkage of the EB\nPVD TBC has occurred. On cooling to room temperature this has lead to a net tensile stress\n4in the coating (and associated compressive stresses in the substrate) resulting in the observed\nconcave sample geometry. Differences in the expansion coefficients of the alumina and zirconia\nsubstrates account for the observed differences in the degree of curvature. Crack opening due to\nsintering is predominantly in one direction, as can be seen in Figure 11, it is believed that this\naccounts for the difference in the radius of curvature in the two orthogonal directions.\nThe Test Rig and Erosion Test Procedure\nThe erosion tests were all carried out in the high temperature erosion facility at Cranfield\nUniversity a schematic of which is given in Figure 2. The rig consists of a number of key\ncomponents starting with the compressor (C), which supplies a pressure vessel (P). This is there\nto ensure that a constant pressure of compressed air is supplied to the heating system (H). The\nair passes through a convoluted, labyrinth path in the pressurised heating system, which is\nelectrically heated, before entering the acceleration tube (T). The erodent material is fed via a\nscrew feeder and a venturii nozzle into the acceleration tube, where the compressed air\naccelerates the particles before they impact the test specimen in the chamber (S). The test\nsamples are attached to a carousel, which is capable of holding six different specimens at\ndifferent angles with respect to the impacting particle stream.\nThe range of operating conditions possible are given in Table 4,where it should be noted that the\nmaximum velocity of the erodent is dependent on the particle size and its density. Small, low\ndensity particles are capable of the highest velocities and almost attain the gas velocity.\nAll samples were weighed before the erosion testing and then placed in the carousel. Each\nsample was then exposed to the particle laden gas stream for 30s after which, and once all the\n5samples had been tested, they were removed from the rig and re-weighted. This was repeated\nfor six exposure periods or until coating penetration. For this particular set of tests the following\nerosion conditions were used, Table 5.\nResults\nUnfortunately, not all the samples could be tested as originally planned. One of the alumina tiles\ncracked while measuring the radius of curvature and then broke during the X-Ray analyses. The\nsecond alumina sample broke during the first erosion increment, before any mass change could\nbe determined, thus there is no erosion rate data for the sintered TBC deposited on alumina tiles\nin the first set of tests. Further, one of the coatings on the C263 substrate spalled during the\naging process so only one aged sample was erosion tested. Thus only 5 samples were tested the\nresults of which are presented graphically in Figure 3 with measured erosion rates summarised\nin Table 6.\nThe results of the second set of samples are presented graphically in Figure 4, as mentioned\nearlier sample 10 (24hrs @ 1500\u00b0C) spalled during the second erosion increment, and\npresented in Table 7.\nIn Tables 6 and 7 the total erosion rate is calculated from the total mass change divided by the\ntotal mass erodent, where as the steady-state erosion rate is calculated for the straight line\nsection of the erosion graph; see Figures 3 and 4. Both of the sintered samples (1500\u00b0C for\n24hrs) on the zirconia tile had almost eroded through after 5 increments, but initially showed a\nsignificant incubation period. The other samples, as received and aged at 1100\u00b0C for 1 00hrs,\nattained a steady state erosion rate almost immediately.\n6The bar chart, Figure 5, shows how erosion rate increases with an increase in the aging\ncondition. Aging for 30 hrs @ 1100\u00b0C results in a small increase in the erosion rate (20%),\nwhile 100hrs @ 1100\u00b0C almost doubles the erosion rate and 24hrs @ 1500\u00b0C results in a four\nfold increase in the erosion rate.\nX-Ray Analysis\nIn order to investigate whether there were any phase transformations occurring during the aging\ntreatments, X-ray diffraction analysis was performed on a number of the samples in the as\nreceived condition, and then again on the same samples after heat treatment. The X-ray\ndiffraction analysis on the C263 substrate in the as-received condition showed that the coating\nwas tetragonal and with a crystal orientation of (200) for the ceramic deposited on the C263\naluminised material. While the ceramic deposited on the alumina tiles had a predominantly\n(311) crystal orientation, as illustrated in Figure 6.\nFigure 7 shows that there is no change in the crystallographic nature of the YSZ after 1 00hrs at\n1100\u00b0C. However, this is not the case for the sample heat treated for 24hrs at 1500\u00b0C,\nillustrated in Figure 8, where there has been a significant change in the crystal structure of the\nYSZ. The results presented here are for the ceramic deposited on the alumina substrate under\nthe various heat treatment conditions. Similar observations were observed for the ceramic\ndeposited on the zirconia substrate in the as received and the 1500\u00b0C\/24h condition.\nDiscussion\nIt is interesting to note that all three of the reference samples had very similar erosion rates (all\nwithin one standard deviation) while there was a large scatter in the aged and sintered\n7erosion rates. The samples were coated in different runs and one reference sample was tested\nfor each of the coating runs to track repeatability. The results from the reference samples\nindicate that there is a high degree of reproducibility in both the erosion testing and coating\nproduction. This then implies that the large scatter in the results from the heat treated samples\nmust arise from the heat treatment.\nAs can be seen from the micrographs, Figures 9 through to Figure 11, the sample that was aged\nat 1500\u00b0C for 24hrs had started to sinter resulting in an overall larger apparent column diameter\nwith more open boundaries when compared to the sample in the as received condition. It should\nalso be noted that the pyramidal tops, which are a distinctive feature of EB PVD TBCs, were no\nlonger evident after sintering at 1500\u00b0C. The sample that was aged for 100hrs at 1100\u00b0C\nshowed no obvious signs of sintering, or any visible changes to the microstructure as a result of\nthe heat treatment.\nAfter erosion testing each sample was sectioned, mounted in resin, polished and examined in\nthe scanning electron microscope (SEM). In figure 12, cross-sections of the as received and the\nsintered TBCs are compared. For the as received sample the pyramidal tops as well as the\ndendritic microstructure of the TBC are clearly visible. This is not the case for the sintered\nsample where one may observe that there is also some evidence of the columns sintering\ntogether. This is better illustrated in Figure 13, where sintering between the columns can be\nclearly seen.\nAs can be seen by comparing the micrographs in Figure 13 (a) and Figure 14 (a) and (b), there is\nno evidence for a change in the erosion as a result of these aging treatments. These micrographs\nare consistent with the published mechanism for small particle erosion, namely near surface\ncracking of the TBC columns [9,10]. This implies that any changes in the\n8erosion rate must be due to structural changes, as a result of sintering and phase transformations\nand\/or changes in the mechanical properties, fracture toughness and hardness, of the TBC due to\nthe thermal aging processes.\nIn the case of the 1500\u00b0C aged samples the increase in the erosion rate was attributed to the fact\nthat the columns sintered together allowing cracks initiated in the near surface region to\npropagate further resulting in a greater volume loss per impact and hence a greater erosion rate.\nThe samples heat treated at 1100\u00b0C for various times showed no signs of sintering, yet still\nshowed a significant increase in the erosion rate compared to the as received samples, which\nimplies that other factors also affect the erosion rate. This is most likely due to changes in the\nmechanical properties of the TBC due to the aging process, in the form of changes in the micro-\nporosity of the columns. Due to the columnar microstructure of EB PVD TBCs it is not easy to\nmeasure the mechanical properties of the coating. An in depth study on how the aging\ntreatments affect the hardness and the fracture toughness of the columns needs to be undertaken\nin order to fully understand this increase in the erosion rate.\nValidity of Aging Treatments\nThese samples were all heat treated under isothermal conditions in a laboratory furnace, thus\nthe whole of the YSZ attained the aging temperature. It was for this reason that ceramic\nsubstrates had to be used at 1500\u00b0C. In service, blade cooling is used and there will be a\ntemperature gradient across the coating of 80-120\u00b0C. Thus, in those cases where the\ntemperature in the turbine is sufficient to cause sintering in the YSZ only the top few microns\nof the columns actually sinter. This will results in an enhanced erosion rate until the sintered\n9layer is removed. However, continued exposure may result in further surface sintering and\ntherefore a sustained increase in erosion rate.\nThe aging tests at the lower temperatures (1100\u00b0C) are more representative of the temperatures\nthe coating sees under normal service conditions, but to be truly representative of service\nconditions it would be necessary to age the samples with a cooling air flow across the back of\nthe samples, thus generating a temperature gradient across the coating. This can be achieved in\nburner rigs and ribbon furnaces but the control of the exact temperature is difficult and not very\naccurate. There is definitely a benefit in testing turbine hardware that has seen service, however\nit is very difficult to obtain such samples for testing and the authors would welcome some\nengine run components for erosion testing.\nConclusions\nIt has been shown that thermal aging will increase the erosion rate of EB PVD TBCs when\ncompared to virgin samples. From these preliminary studies it appears that aging at 1500\u00b0C for\n24hrs increases the erosion rate by a factor of 4 due to partial sintering of the columns thus\nenabling crack propagation across neighbouring columns to occur resulting in a greater volume\nloss per impact. Aging at 1100\u00b0C for 100hrs increased the erosion rate by a factor of 2 although\nno evidence of column sintering could be observed.\nFuture Work\nThis work has shown that there is much about the erosion of EB PVD TBCs which still has to be\nresearched, particularly in aged samples. Theses preliminary studies have highlighted a number\nof areas which need in depth investigation, namely the effect of aging and sintering\n10\non the properties and performance of EB PVD TBCs. A more structured and systematic\ninvestigation into these effects is currently underway the results of which will be published in the\nnear future. This will include nano-indentation, X-ray analyses as well as erosion testing of\nsamples in the as received condition as well as after various aging heat treatments. Since there\nappears to be an unexpectedly high variation in the erosion rates of the aged samples future\nstudies will need to ensure that sufficient samples are available for erosion testing for a statistical\nanalysis.\n11\nReference List\n1.
