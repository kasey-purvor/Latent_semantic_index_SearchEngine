The tension \nbetween the regulation of online activities and the preservation of the right of \n\u201cgenerativity\u201d among Internet users is particularly evident in the \u201carchitecture of \nparticipation\u201d synonymous with the Web 2.0 universe, Tim O\u2019Reilly\u2019s (2005) \ndescriptor for the section of the World Wide Web that promotes bottom-up \ncommunication via platforms such as weblogs and social networking sites (SNS). \nWhile some scholars have suggested that the use of these sites may serve to \nencourage the development of social skills among teenagers and even create \nbridging social capital between different groups (Ellison et al. 2007), concerns \ncontinue to be raised among global policymakers about the potential sexual \nexploitation of children on these sites, as well as their possible misuse by young \npeople themselves via the disclosure of sensitive information and anti-social \nbehaviors such as cyberbullying (Hinduja and Patchin 2008). \nThis article adds to the policy debate over how to promote Internet Safety \non Web 2.0 platforms by focusing on the extent to which the use of social media \nto organize anti-social behavior in contested areas of Belfast is recognized and \naddressed by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) and community \ngroups in these areas. The UK Home Office (2010) defines anti-social behavior as \n\u201cany aggressive, intimidating or destructive activity that damages or destroys \nanother person\u2019s quality of life.\u201d Recent reports in the Belfast Telegraph have \nsuggested that young people who live in close proximity to sectarian interfaces, \nthe barriers between Catholic and Protestant districts that local residents often \nrefer to as \u201cpeace walls,\u201d have used Bebo to organize street riots in contested \nareas of North and East Belfast, with the perpetrators often posting videos of these \nattacks on YouTube (Belfast Telegraph 2008; 2009). This paper sets out to \nexplore the level of awareness and responses of stakeholders to the use of social \nmedia to organize these incidents of what has been called \u201crecreational rioting,\u201d a \nphenomenon defined by Jarman and O\u2019Halloran (2001) as \u201cclashes between \nyoung people in interface areas\u201d that \u201coccur out of boredom and bravado rather \nthan having an overtly political basis\u201d (p. 3). It does so by reviewing the relevant \ntheoretical perspectives on the use of social media to organize anti-social \nbehavior, analyzing how key stakeholders promote Internet Safety on these \nplatforms, and presenting the findings of a preliminary set of interviews with \ncommunity workers and a representative from the Police Service of Northern \nIreland. \n \n1\nReilly: Policy Responses to Anti-social Networking in Northern Ireland\nPublished by Berkeley Electronic Press, 2011\nBackground \n \nYoung people in Northern Ireland appear to be more comfortable in their use of \nnew media technologies than their parents. The 2010 Media Literacy Audit \ncommissioned by the UK\u2019s Office of Communications (Ofcom) suggests that \nNorthern Irish adults remain the most cautious in the United Kingdom when it \ncomes to entering their personal information online, with only 56 percent of \nparents who had children aged between 5 and 15 years believing that the \nInternet\u2019s benefits outweighed the risks associated with its use (Ofcom 2010a). By \ncontrast, recent studies suggest that there is little to differentiate between the \nonline social networking practices of young people in Northern Ireland and their \npeers in the rest of the United Kingdom. The Ofcom Children\u2019s Media Literacy \nAudit in the Nations (Ofcom 2010b) found that Northern Irish children aged \nbetween 5 and 15 years were no more or less likely than their peers in England, \nScotland, and Wales to maintain a social networking profile. Indeed, the study \nfound that 43 percent of children in Northern Ireland checked their social \nnetworking profile at least once a week, 2 percent higher than the average across \nthe United Kingdom. Young people in Northern Ireland tend to use social \nnetworking sites to communicate with their family and friends. This finding \nresonates with much of the current research in the field that indicates that the \nmajority of teenagers who use social networking sites do so to sustain existing \noffline relationships rather than to contact strangers (Ellison et al. 2007). \nHowever, Lloyd and Devine (2009) point to the potential online risks that children \nmay face on these platforms, with a small minority of 8\u201311 year olds (17 percent) \nin Northern Ireland confirming that they had met in person someone who they had \ninitially contacted on a social networking site. This is one example of the \u201cyouth \nthrill-seeking behavior\u201d in Northern Ireland that has arguably been made easier \nvia social networking sites such as Facebook (Goldie and Ruddy 2010). \nThe purpose of this article is to explore the extent to which key \nstakeholders are aware of the use of social networking sites by young people to \nplan street riots in interface areas in Northern Ireland and their responses to this \n\u201canti-social\u201d use of sites such as Bebo. Interface areas are defined here as disputed \nterritories that are contested by Loyalist communities, the predominantly \nProtestant neighborhoods from which Loyalist paramilitaries who previously used \npolitical violence in support of the union with Great Britain drew support, and \ntheir Republican counterparts, the predominantly Catholic neighborhoods from \nwhich Republican paramilitaries who previously used political violence in support \nof a united Ireland drew support during the conflict. Hughes et al. (2007) suggest \nthat there has been an increase in \u201cchill factors\u201d such as the demarcation of \nsectarian boundaries with flags and graffiti, as the zero-sum perception of politics \n2\nPolicy & Internet, Vol. 3 [2011], Iss. 1, Art. 7\nhttp:\/\/www.psocommons.org\/policyandinternet\/vol3\/iss1\/art7\nDOI: 10.2202\/1944-2866.1071\nin these areas has remained largely intact in the post-Good Friday Agreement era.1 \nProtestants perceive they have lost their \u201crelative advantage\u201d in Northern Ireland \ndue to concessions made to Republicans in the peace process. Meanwhile, \nCatholics appear cognizant of the reduction of inequality of Northern Ireland but \nremain fearful of perceived Protestant bigotry and intolerance. An unintended \nconsequence of the construction of \u201cpeace walls\u201d in urban interface areas has been \nthat they have provided a focal point for violent clashes between groups of young \npeople from the Loyalist and Republican communities they were designed to keep \napart. This has remained a persistent problem in interface areas throughout the \nperiod of conflict transformation and has been described by Goldie and Ruddy \n(2010) as \u201cboth the product and outcome of interface issues\u201d (p. 9). \nRecreational rioting is differentiated from paramilitary-led and \norchestrated violence in interface areas due to the absence of a clear political \nagenda among its participants, who tend to be predominantly\u2014but not \nexclusively\u2014young people aged between 10 and 17 years (Jarman and \nO\u2019Halloran 2001). Although reports in the Belfast Telegraph have claimed that \nLoyalist paramilitaries have organized street riots involving young people in \nNorth Belfast (Belfast Telegraph 2010), a number of studies over the past decade \nhave suggested that the majority of violent clashes are motivated by boredom \nrather than an overtly political agenda (Cownie 2008; Centre for Young Men\u2019s \nStudies 2009). Throwing stones at people living on the other side of an interface \nmay represent a \u201ccheap night out\u201d for teenagers in these areas, particularly given \nthe high levels of socioeconomic deprivation that continue to blight the North \nBelfast electoral constituency that has been the location of the most widely \nreported incidents of recreational rioting in Northern Ireland over the past decade. \nHowever, Leonard (2008) suggests that it is overly simplistic to characterize this \nviolence as non-political in nature. Her study of 80 Catholic and Protestant \nteenagers in North Belfast found that group norms established during the conflict \ncontinued to influence young people\u2019s conceptualization of in-group and out-\ngroup identities and that it was difficult to differentiate the behavior of child \nrioters from the political context in which they had grown up. \nStudies conducted by Leonard (2008; 2010) and the Centre for Young \nMen\u2019s Studies (2009) have linked social networking sites to anti-social behavior \nin interface areas. Both reports suggested that young men aged between 13 and 16 \nyears in particular used sites such as Bebo to threaten members of rival interface \n                                                 \n1 The Good Friday Agreement was an agreement between the Northern Irish political parties (with \nthe exception of the Democratic Unionist Party who opposed the treaty) and the UK and Irish \ngovernments, signed on April 10, 1998 and later ratified in both countries via national \nreferendums. It included plans for an Assembly with 108 members, the creation of North\u2013South \nadministrative bodies, and constitutional change in both the United Kingdom and the Republic of \nIreland to recognize the principle of consent in determining the future of Northern Ireland. \n3\nReilly: Policy Responses to Anti-social Networking in Northern Ireland\nPublished by Berkeley Electronic Press, 2011\ncommunities and to organize violence in their respective areas. However, public \nawareness about the scale of this activity has tended to be limited to media reports \nof violent clashes between Catholic and Protestant youths in areas such as the \nArdoyne district in North Belfast and the Short Strand in East Belfast. These have \ninvariably taken the form of a reference to a statement from a Police Service of \nNorthern Ireland (PSNI) spokesperson stating that the street riots were organized \nvia social networking sites. The Belfast Telegraph reportage of the Ardoyne riots \nin June 2009 is the exception to this rule, with its online edition using user-\ngenerated YouTube videos to show how young people engaged in street riots \nfollowing a contentious Orange Order march in the predominantly Catholic area \n(Belfast Telegraph 2009).2 \nEfforts by the PSNI to identify and arrest suspected teenage participants in \nthese street riots have been publicized in most if not all of the media reportage of \nthese incidents. For example, the PSNI released CCTV images of 23 young \npeople who were involved in the Ardoyne street riots in August 2009, leading to \n14 teenagers being charged with public order offences (Belfast Telegraph 2010). \nHowever, there is very limited information available in the public domain about \nhow key stakeholders are responding to the use of social media by young people \nto organize this violence in interface areas. This paper sets out to add to the \nlimited empirical data on this issue by presenting an exploratory study of the \nperspectives of two key stakeholders involved in the prevention of anti-social \nbehavior in interface areas, namely community workers and the PSNI. In doing \nso, it will explore the extent to which these actors recognize and respond to the \nproblem of the use of sites such as Bebo to organize recreational rioting in \ncontested areas such as North Belfast. \n \n \nWeb 2.0 and the Organization of Anti-Social Behavior: The Story \nSo Far \n \nMuch of the recent debate in the literature on the mobilizing potential of new \nmedia technologies has tended to focus on the use of social media to organize \nprotests either in democratic nation-states (Gillan and Pickerill 2008) or in \nauthoritarian regimes (Morozov 2010). By contrast, there have been relatively few \nstudies of how social media have been used to organize anti-social behavior such \nas street riots in democratic nation-states. In order to analyze how social \n                                                 \n2 The Orange Order is the largest Protestant fraternal organization in Ireland, with an estimated \n80,000\u2013100,000 members. Traditionally linked to the Ulster Unionist Party, the Order organizes \nseveral thousand marches each year, with the climax around the 12th July celebration of King \nWilliam of Orange\u2019s triumph over the Catholic King James at the Battle of the Boyne (1798). \n4\nPolicy & Internet, Vol. 3 [2011], Iss. 1, Art. 7\nhttp:\/\/www.psocommons.org\/policyandinternet\/vol3\/iss1\/art7\nDOI: 10.2202\/1944-2866.1071\nnetworking sites are being used to organize street riots in Northern Ireland \nthrough multi-stakeholder perspectives, one must first develop an understanding \nof what is meant by the term anti-social behavior. The UK Home Office (2010) \nprovides an extensive list of examples of anti-social behaviors on its website, \nincluding rowdy and noisy behavior, vandalism and graffiti, street drinking, \ndealing drugs, and yobbish behavior. These are all activities that have the \npotential to damage another person\u2019s quality of life and are particularly prevalent \nin economically deprived urban areas, such as those surrounding sectarian \ninterfaces in Belfast. However, the posting of pictures and videos on YouTube, \nthe use of social media for gang recruitment, and cyberbullying would appear to \nbe the three anti-social behaviors that are most prevalent among the teenage \nparticipants in urban street riots in Belfast (Centre for Young Men\u2019s Studies \n2009). \nThe posting of pictures and videos showing young people engaging in \nanti-social behavior, such as unprovoked violent attacks on strangers and the \nconsumption of alcohol when under the legal age to do so, has been the subject of \nmuch media coverage in the United Kingdom over the past five years. \nGovernment ministers have called for YouTube to remove videos of unprovoked \nattacks on unsuspecting young people as far back as October 2006 (Mediawatch \n2006). This phenomenon, also referred to as \u201chappy slapping,\u201d has continued to \nbe projected via social networking websites, as demonstrated by the recent trial of \ntwo men in Glasgow accused of assaulting another man and posting a video of the \ncrime on YouTube (BBC News 2010). However, the use of social media to share \nphotographs and videos of drunken behavior has arguably become an everyday \nactivity of many young people in both the United Kingdom and the Republic of \nIreland. Fionnuala Sheehan of Drinkaware.ie has claimed that this activity has led \nto a \u201cnormalization of drunken behavior\u201d among young people, who have a \nperception that all people in their late teens drink to excess and engage in other \nanti-social behaviors (Corden 2010).3 \nThere has also been evidence that gangs are recruiting new members and \nthreatening their rivals on social networking sites. Kelley (2009) suggests that \npolice in the United Kingdom and the United States have noticed an upward trend \nin the use of social media to organize both criminal and anti-social behaviors. \nMembers of gangs often pose with weapons on their social networking profiles \nand post messages designed to intimidate members of rival groups. A recent \nexample of this phenomenon was uncovered during the trial of 10 members of the \nManchester-based Fallowfield Mad Dogs gang for affray in August 2009. Judge \nClement Goldstone QC took action to limit the online activities of the gang after it \nwas revealed that the defendants had posed for photographs on their MySpace and \n                                                 \n3 Drinkaware.ie is an Irish information portal on alcohol and drinking. \n5\nReilly: Policy Responses to Anti-social Networking in Northern Ireland\nPublished by Berkeley Electronic Press, 2011\nBebo profiles making \u201cgun salutes\u201d and stating that they were \u201cpreparing for \nwar.\u201d4 Similar behaviors on social networking sites were described in the recent \nCentre for Young Men\u2019s Studies report (2009) that examined youth violence in \nNorthern Irish interface areas. The study found that many teenage boys admitted \nto using sites such as Bebo to threaten their counterparts from the other side of the \ninterface. However, the scale of the use of Bebo by Northern Irish youths to \nthreaten members of rival interface communities is difficult to estimate given the \nrelatively limited empirical data in this area. \nCyberbullying is perhaps the most well-known anti-social behavior that \nhas been linked to the use of social media by young people. The UK Department \nfor Children, Schools, and Families (2007) defines cyberbullying as \u201cthe use of \ninformation communication technology, particularly mobile phones and the \nInternet to deliberately upset someone\u201d (p. 2). Instant Messaging and social \nnetworking sites have made it much easier for peer-to-peer harassment in the \noffline world to be communicated in the online sphere (Ybarra and Mitchell \n2004). Although there is limited data available to show the extent of \ncyberbullying in the United Kingdom, the Byron review into children and \ntechnology (2008) identified it as a significant threat facing young people who use \nsocial networking sites on a regular basis. However, the nexus between \ntechnology and bullying also demonstrates how online and offline relationships \nhave increasingly become blurred in the Web 2.0 era. Scholars such as Mesch and \nTalmud (2007) and Hampton (2004) argue that the criticism that online ties are by \ndefinition weak and incomplete is no longer valid, given that people increasingly \nuse both online and offline spaces to sustain their pre-existing relationships with \nfriends and family members. This also arguably applies to those Internet users \nwho use social networking websites to engage in anti-social behavior such as \nhappy slapping or cyberbullying. New media technologies are not likely to lead to \nanti-social behavior in offline spaces unless their users seek to use them for such \npurposes. As Kelley (2009) asserts, \u201cviolence was around long before Bebo, so \nlet\u2019s not blame the medium for offline violence\u201d (p. 1). The implication of this \nemerging strand of research for this study is clear. In order to investigate the role \nof social media in the organization of recreational riots in Belfast interface areas, \none must also consider the offline relationships that teenage rioters cultivate with \nboth in-group and out-group members and how these are communicated via these \nsites. \n \n                                                 \n4 The 10 gang members were banned from posting pictures of themselves with other gang \nmembers on their social networking profiles (The Independent 2009). \n \n6\nPolicy & Internet, Vol. 3 [2011], Iss. 1, Art. 7\nhttp:\/\/www.psocommons.org\/policyandinternet\/vol3\/iss1\/art7\nDOI: 10.2202\/1944-2866.1071\nResponses to Anti-Social Behavior Organized Via Social Media \n \nThis paper will also explore the responses of stakeholders to the use of social \nmedia by young people to organize street riots in contested urban interface areas. \nMorozov (2010) suggests that the use of sites such as Twitter to organize \ndemonstrations has made it easier for authoritarian regimes such as the Belarusian \nand Iranian governments to monitor the activities of anti-state protestors. Clearly, \nthe same form of surveillance on social media sites is unlikely to be present in the \nUnited Kingdom, particularly given that UK citizens are legally entitled to \nexpress their opposition to state policies via public demonstrations. A better \ncomparison can be made between efforts to monitor the activities of online \ncriminal gangs and those young people who use social media to engage in \nrecreational rioting in Northern Ireland. Although there is limited evidence in the \npublic domain as to the extent of the surveillance of the online activities of \ncriminal gangs due to the sensitive nature of these operations, it is known that \npolice forces in the United Kingdom use social media to conduct investigations \ninto the criminal activities of gangs (Kelley 2009). Therefore, it was considered \nhighly unlikely that the PSNI would provide extensive information for this paper \nabout the level of their surveillance. Instead, this paper will focus primarily on the \nresponses of those stakeholders who are engaged in the prevention of young \npeople using social media to organize anti-social behavior in interface areas. This \npaper will analyze how community groups and the PSNI are promoting Internet \nSafety in these areas and how effective these stakeholders feel these campaigns \nhave been in addressing this issue. \nThe focus of UK policymakers thus far has tended to be on cyberbullying, \nonline grooming of children by pedophiles, and preventing young people from \naccessing illegal or harmful content on social networking sites (Byron 2008). One \nof the key recommendations of the Byron review was that there was a need for a \ncoordinated approach towards children\u2019s digital safety among parents, the Internet \nindustry, voluntary bodies, and the government. The UK Council for Child \nInternet Safety (UKCCIS) was created in September 2008 to bring together these \nstakeholders, and has overall responsibility for the promotion of events such as \nSafer Internet Day (February 9, 2010) and raising public awareness about Internet \nSafety. The ThinkuKnow Internet Safety program has been taught in UK schools \nsince 2006. Information is provided on how young people can both identify and \nreport harmful activity on social networking sites, ranging from cyberbullying to \nthe risks of talking to strangers on these sites (CEOP 2010a).5 This program has \nsought to encourage young people to set their social networking profiles to private \n                                                 \n5 The site provides videos showing young people talking about these online risks and how they \nshould be reported to CEOP. \n7\nReilly: Policy Responses to Anti-social Networking in Northern Ireland\nPublished by Berkeley Electronic Press, 2011\nin order to avoid the disclosure of sensitive data to Internet users who might use \nthis information for illegal activity such as identity fraud or for the online \ngrooming of adolescents. The issue has also been highlighted on the social \nnetworking sites themselves, with the users of Facebook receiving a message \nasking them to check and update their privacy settings in December 2009 (boyd \nand Hargittai 2010). Although this particular update was prompted by changes \nmade by Facebook itself to its default privacy settings, it nevertheless served to \nmake its users more aware of the need to protect their personal information from \nthe attention of \u201cunwanted visitors\u201d to their profiles. \nRecent studies have suggested that campaigns such as ThinkuKnow may \nhave been successful in increasing awareness among young people about the need \nto restrict public access to their profiles (Hinduja and Patchin 2008). A recent \nstudy found that 78 percent of children aged 12\u201315 years were likely to keep their \nprofiles private (Ofcom 2010b). Boys were more likely to allow their profiles to \nbe seen by anyone compared to girls, who appeared keener to restrict access to \ntheir personal information. However, there have been some indications in recent \nstudies of U.S. social networking practices that the moral panic surrounding \nonline predators on sites such as MySpace in 2005 and the privacy updates by \nsocial networking sites have prompted young people to make their profiles private \n(boyd 2008). Furthermore, although young people are becoming increasingly \nvigilant about the sharing of personal information on their social networking sites, \na significant number still choose to post personal information on publicly \naccessible profiles (boyd and Hargittai 2010). \nThe First UKCCIS Child Internet Strategy was launched in December \n2009 with a mission statement that referred to the need to provide \u201chigh quality \ncontrols to stop children seeing harmful and inappropriate content online and \nmonitor their behaviour\u201d (UKCCIS 2009: 5). A key pillar of this strategy focuses \non the need for the Internet industry to make it easier for users to report illegal or \nharmful activity on social networking sites and to ensure that children are not \nexposed to age-inappropriate content such as pornography. A key \nrecommendation was that the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre \n(CEOP) website should become the one-stop shop for Child Internet Safety in the \nUnited Kingdom. The primary purpose of CEOP is to \u201cprotect children, young \npeople, families and society from pedophiles and sex offenders, and in particular \nthose who use the Internet and other new technologies in the sexual exploitation \nof children\u201d (CEOP 2010b). CEOP has provided Internet Safety training materials \nto teachers, community workers, police officers, and child protection specialists in \nthe United Kingdom since its formation in April 2006. The CEOP Ambassador \ntraining course is aimed specifically at professionals who work with children and \nyoung people and who wish to deliver the ThinkuKnow program for 11\u201316 year \nolds. \n8\nPolicy & Internet, Vol. 3 [2011], Iss. 1, Art. 7\nhttp:\/\/www.psocommons.org\/policyandinternet\/vol3\/iss1\/art7\nDOI: 10.2202\/1944-2866.1071\nA key theme that emerges from the UK Child Internet Safety Strategy is \nthat young people must be empowered to use new media technologies but also be \naware of the potential risks of online communication. This is congruent with both \nthe principles for Safer Social Networking adopted by the European Union \n(2009), and academic studies of adolescent social networking practices (Hinduja \nand Patchin 2008; Livingstone and Brake 2010). What is also clear is that efforts \nto reduce the risks associated with social networking practices are based on a \nmulti-agency approach towards the promotion of Internet Safety, and a \ncombination of both peer-to-peer and conventional forms of surveillance on these \nsites. This paper presents a preliminary analysis of whether key stakeholders in \ninterface areas in Belfast perceive these Internet Safety campaigns to have been \neffective in promoting the safe and responsible use of social media by young \npeople in their respective areas. \n \n \nResearch Questions \n \nSpecifically, three research questions emerge from the preceding literature review. \nThese are: \n \n(1) What is the level of awareness among community workers and the Police \nService of Northern Ireland about the use of social networking sites by young \npeople to plan anti-social behavior such as street riots in interface areas? \n(2) To what extent is there a coordinated response between these stakeholders \ntowards the use of social networking sites by young people to organize anti-\nsocial behavior in interface areas? \n(3) Do these stakeholders perceive that Internet Safety campaigns in Northern \nIreland have been effective in promoting the responsible use of social \nnetworking sites among young people who live in interface areas? \n \nTo investigate these questions, 10 semi-structured interviews were conducted, \nwith nine community workers and one Education Advisor from the PSNI \nCommunity Safety Branch. Interviews were conducted between June 2009 and \nJuly 2010.  \nThe PSNI officer had over three years experience of writing and distributing \nInternet Safety training materials for schools and community centers, and was \ntherefore able to comment on strategies used to prevent the use of social \nnetworking sites for anti-social behavior. This female officer was not available for \ninterview during the period of data collection, but provided written responses to \nthe interview questions.  \n9\nReilly: Policy Responses to Anti-social Networking in Northern Ireland\nPublished by Berkeley Electronic Press, 2011\nCommunity workers were selected due to their constant interaction with \nyoung people in community centers and their role in promoting Internet Safety in \ninterface areas. Contact with the community workers was arranged through the \nBelfast Interface Project (BIP), an umbrella non-governmental organization \nincorporating 22 community groups across Belfast whose purpose is to promote \npositive intercommunity relationships in contested interface areas. A total of 13 \ncommunity groups did not respond to the invitation to participate in the project. \nCharacteristics of groups who responded and those who did not were examined \nfor systematic differences between the two groups and none were found in terms \nof group size, community identification, or the area of Belfast in which they were \nbased. Face-to-face interviews were held with six of the community workers in \ntheir respective community centers in Belfast, one in a city center coffee house, \nand two of the interviewees were contacted via telephone. All of the community \nworkers had at least two years\u2019 experience working in interface areas and all were \nmale and aged between 25 and 40 years. Due to the persistent threat of violence \nagainst community workers and police officers in these areas over the past three \ndecades (Community Relations Council 2008), it was agreed that interviewee \nidentities would not be revealed in the study. Thus, interviewees are identified in \nthis study according to the area in which they were based. All of the participants \nagreed that the interviews could be recorded for later transcription and analysis. \nThe community worker interview schedule comprised nine questions relating \nto how social media were used by members of rival interface communities and \ncommunity groups to interact with one another (see Appendix 1). The community \nworkers were asked to comment on how sites such as Bebo were being used by \nyoung people in interface areas and what strategies, if any, were being deployed \nto prevent social networking sites being used to plan anti-social behavior. They \nwere also asked to give an opinion on the role of community groups in the \npromotion of the responsible and safe use of sites such as Bebo. \nThe interview with the PSNI Educational Officer consisted of 15 questions \nrelating to the role of new media in their community safety program, feedback \nreceived by key stakeholders in relation to Internet Safety training, and the \nstrategies deployed by the police to prevent the use of social networking sites by \nyoung people to plan street riots (see Appendix 2). The officer was also asked \nwhether the PSNI were monitoring these sites to gather intelligence about \npotential incidents of street riots in interface areas. The interviewee was also \nasked to comment on the resources that were used by the PSNI Community Safety \nBranch to promote Internet Safety and how effective they felt these campaigns \nhad been in Northern Ireland. \nBoth interview schedules were subjected to an internal reliability check \nconducted by a colleague with extensive experience in qualitative data analysis. A \nthematic approach was used to analyze the data after transcription and themes \n10\nPolicy & Internet, Vol. 3 [2011], Iss. 1, Art. 7\nhttp:\/\/www.psocommons.org\/policyandinternet\/vol3\/iss1\/art7\nDOI: 10.2202\/1944-2866.1071\nwere extracted and discussed until consensus was achieved. Quotations are \nprovided to illustrate key themes that emerged in the course of analysis. \n \nResults \n \n1. Stakeholder Awareness about \u201cAnti-Social\u201d Networking is Based \nPrimarily on Rumor and Hearsay \n \nAll of the community workers confirmed that they were aware of incidents of \nstreet rioting that had been organized on social networking sites. Two of the North \nBelfast community workers stated that the violence that marred the lighting of the \nChristmas tree at Belfast City Hall in December 2009 had been organized on \nBebo. A West Belfast community worker also asserted that violence between \nyouth gangs on the Springfield Road\/Shankill interface was organized via SMS \ntext messaging and Bebo. A common theme in the interviews was that many of \nthe participants in these street riots were friends with members of the \u201cother\u201d \ncommunity. An East Belfast community worker reported that the so-called \n\u201crecreational rioting\u201d in their area had been organized on Bebo by children who \nknew each other from the local integrated college. This interviewee noted that the \nviolence in their areas should be characterized as anti-social behavior rather than a \nreturn to the sectarian violence synonymous with the \u201cTroubles\u201d: \n \n\u201cRioting is designed to get a bit of craic with the PSNI, young people self-\njustify their violence, defending their community, feel as if they have \nmissed out on the conflict.\u201d  \n      (East Belfast community worker 1) \nThere was much support among the interviewees for the thesis that this was \nanti-social behavior rather than a return to the \u201cTroubles,\u201d with one community \nworker suggesting that some people were always likely to use social networking \nsites \u201cfor what it\u2019s not meant to be used for.\u201d However, two of the interviewees \nwere uncomfortable with the use of the term recreational rioting, which they felt \ndepoliticized this violence. In the words of one West Belfast community worker: \n \n\u201cI think there is also a sectarian dimension to it, children and young people \nmay not know, or have met, anyone on the other side but there is a sense \nthat they are the enemy.\u201d \n     (West Belfast community worker 1) \n11\nReilly: Policy Responses to Anti-social Networking in Northern Ireland\nPublished by Berkeley Electronic Press, 2011\nThe study found that only one of the interviewees maintained a social \nnetworking profile. One of the West Belfast community workers reported that he \nhad been \u201cso scared\u201d by the CEOP training that he had received that he had \ncanceled his membership of social networking sites such as Facebook, and had \nrefused to allow his children to set up their own profiles. Much of the evidence \npointing towards the use of sites such as Bebo by young people to organize anti-\nsocial behavior appeared to be based on hearsay: \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s anecdotal, no hard evidence. Kids tell you, teachers, different \ncommunity workers.\u201d \n      (East Belfast community worker 2) \n \nThere was a perception shared by all of the interviewees that community \nworkers often lacked the technical skills to use social media effectively. This was \nindicative of an age-related digital divide in attitudes to and usage of social media \n(Ofcom 2010a). One East Belfast community worker stated that he had until \nrecently used an administrative assistant to answer his emails for him and was \n\u201csomething of a backwoodsman\u201d in relation to the use of mobile technology. This \noften left the interviewees reliant upon others for information on the use of sites \nsuch as Bebo for anti-social purposes. For example, one North Belfast community \nworker stated that his teenage daughter had made him aware of discussions \namong young people in their area about a planned street riot between Catholic and \nProtestant youths. Another interviewee suggested that youth workers often had \ngreater awareness of the \u201canti-social\u201d networking practices adopted by young \npeople than community workers, by virtue of their familiarity with new media \ntechnologies: \n \n\u201cYoung youth workers get it [Bebo], and they use it, and they\u2019ve used it for \nyears. Sometimes with community workers, sometimes teachers as well, it\u2019s \na bit more this dangerous thing that you need to be very careful with.\u201d \n      (North Belfast community worker 2) \n \nThe PSNI Educational Officer declined to comment on their level of \nawareness of this activity or on what impact social networking sites were having \non community relations in Northern Ireland in general. The interviewee stated that \nthe PSNI were aware of the use of social media by young people in Northern \nIreland to plan street riots but stressed that their patterns of usage were no \ndifferent than in other parts of the United Kingdom: \n \n12\nPolicy & Internet, Vol. 3 [2011], Iss. 1, Art. 7\nhttp:\/\/www.psocommons.org\/policyandinternet\/vol3\/iss1\/art7\nDOI: 10.2202\/1944-2866.1071\n\u201cThe Internet is as prevalent and popular a communication medium in \nNorthern Ireland as it is in any other part of the UK. Bearing this in mind, \nPSNI have adopted the use of social networking sites to address not only \nyoung people, but also the general public.\u201d \n       (PSNI Educational Officer) \n \n2. There Does Appear to be a Coordinated Approach Towards the \nPrevention of the Use of Social Media by Young People to Organize Anti-\nSocial Behavior \n \nThe study suggested that there was a joined-up approach towards the prevention \nof young people using social networking sites to organize anti-social behavior in \ninterface areas. However, surveillance was only a small part of the response of \nthese stakeholders, whose primary responsibility was to promote the responsible \nand safe use of social media among young people in these areas. As expected, \nthese stakeholders reported that they did not look at social networking profiles for \ninformation that might help prevent incidents of so-called \u201crecreational rioting\u201d in \ninterface areas. Community workers reported that they were only able to crudely \nmonitor social networking practices of young people by \u201cpeering over their \nshoulders\u201d when they used communal computing facilities in their community \ncenters: \n \n\u201cWe keep an eye on what they are using it [Bebo] for. They use it to \ncommunicate with people in the same room, not with the outside.\u201d \n(West Belfast community worker 1) \n \nOne East Belfast community worker confirmed that young people were \nbanned from using Bebo because they had been using it to discuss and plan anti-\nsocial activities such as drug dealing: \n \n\u201cThey are not allowed to use Bebo on it, cos we found them mucking about \non it. We didn\u2019t like some of the things they were doing on it.\u201d \n      (East Belfast community worker 2) \nIt was acknowledged by all of the community workers that they could only \ninfluence the social networking practices of young people within their community \ncenters. This was perhaps a predictable observation, given their self-reported lack \n13\nReilly: Policy Responses to Anti-social Networking in Northern Ireland\nPublished by Berkeley Electronic Press, 2011\nof technical skills and apparent reluctance to use online social networks \nthemselves. \nCommunity workers continued to highlight potential misuses of social \nmedia by young people in their areas to the PSNI, who in turn monitored these \nsites to plan their responses to street riots. One of the North Belfast community \nworkers stated that the PSNI had been monitoring social networking traffic prior \nto the violent clashes in Belfast city center in December 2009 at the request of the \nBelfast Conflict Resolution Consortium, an umbrella organization for community \ngroups across Belfast. This interviewee also confirmed that the PSNI had used \nthis information to plan their policing response to these street riots and to \nminimize disruption to the nearby Christmas tree lights switch-on at Belfast City \nHall. \nThis theme was also implicit in the responses given by the PSNI Education \nAdvisor. She confirmed that there were no specific PSNI strategies to monitor the \nuse of sites such as Bebo by young people to organize anti-social behavior in \nNorthern Ireland. The PSNI did not monitor social networking sites on a regular \nbasis due to the privacy settings on these sites, and there needed to be a legitimate \npurpose for them to do so: \n \n\u201cWe don\u2019t routinely monitor social networking sites. There are new privacy \nsettings on most and some of this is now deemed private information, \ntherefore we require a specific purpose to be monitoring.\u201d \n       (PSNI Educational Officer) \n \nThe PSNI interviewee did not confirm that social networking sites were \nbeing monitored for signs of criminal or terrorist activity, despite evidence from \nauthors such as Kelley (2009) that this has become common practice among \npolice forces on both sides of the Atlantic. Therefore, the hypothesis that the PSNI \nare monitoring social media for signs of young people joining dissident terrorist \norganizations such as the Continuity IRA cannot be ruled out, and this would \nappear worthy of further exploration, particularly given the recent reports in the \nBelfast Telegraph suggesting that the recent spate of street riots in interface areas \nhave been orchestrated by paramilitary organizations (Belfast Telegraph 2010). \nThere was a coordinated strategy in place to address anti-social behavior in \ninterface areas that did not address the use of social media explicitly, but did focus \non the consequences for those young people who engaged in recreational riots. \nThe PSNI interviewee asserted that in 2009 the PSNI had run a series of drama \nworkshops for young people aged 13\u201316 years that dealt specifically with the \ntopic of so-called recreational rioting. These workshops had been designed in \n14\nPolicy & Internet, Vol. 3 [2011], Iss. 1, Art. 7\nhttp:\/\/www.psocommons.org\/policyandinternet\/vol3\/iss1\/art7\nDOI: 10.2202\/1944-2866.1071\nconjunction with local councils and the Northern Ireland Policing Board and were \ndelivered in schools across Northern Ireland: \n \n\u201cThe drama was designed specifically to deal with the topic of rioting, and \npeer pressure placed on young people to become involved. The drama \nlooked at consequences, both long term and short term, which young people \nwill face if they engage in anti-social behaviours such as rioting.\u201d \n       (PSNI Educational Officer) \n \nThe interviewee also confirmed that these workshops were supplemented by \n\u201cbespoke lessons\u201d in secondary schools that dealt with issues such as Public \nOrder Offences and Gang Behavior. One module entitled \u201cUses of the Internet\u201d \nwas specifically designed to promote safe and responsible use of the Internet \namong school children. This was said to have been among the most requested \nlessons for PSNI officers to deliver in schools: \n \n\u201cAs a requested topic, this would be in the top five of our most requested \nlessons for officers to deliver as part of our Citizenship and Safety \nEducation programme.\u201d \n(PSNI Educational Officer) \n \nResources were also provided to parents, children, and community groups \nupon request, as per the CEOP strategy to promote Internet Safety in the rest of \nthe United Kingdom. This included information on how to report cyberbullying \nand harmful material using the CEOP red button on sites such as Bebo. In terms \nof resources, the PSNI Educational Officer confirmed that she was a member of \nthe CEOP Education Advisory Board and often adapted CEOP training materials \nfor use by PSNI officers in schools: \n \n\u201cAll PSNI officers who deliver these messages to young people, parents, \nteachers and community groups have received training and resources from \nCEOP and from the PSNI\u2019s own Education Advisor.\u201d \n       (PSNI Educational Officer) \n \nThe PSNI Education Officer was unable to provide copies of these lessons \ndue to copyright restrictions. However, it was made clear that industry partners \nsuch as Microsoft and Hewlett Packard played a key role in the promotion of \nInternet Safety in Northern Ireland, in much the same fashion as elsewhere in the \nUnited Kingdom. For example, the interviewee referred to the role played by \n15\nReilly: Policy Responses to Anti-social Networking in Northern Ireland\nPublished by Berkeley Electronic Press, 2011\nthese corporations in promotion of the most recent European Union Safer Internet \nDay and in the delivery of Internet Safety lessons in secondary schools across \nNorthern Ireland. The materials used in these lessons were also heavily influenced \nby CEOP initiatives such as ThinkuKnow, which tend to focus on cyberbullying \nand the risks of contacting strangers rather than the use of social media by young \npeople to organize recreational rioting. \nAlthough school children were the primary focus of these initiatives, \ncommunity workers still had a role to play in the promotion of Internet Safety \namong young people in their respective areas. One community worker referred to \nCEOP training as the reason why they encouraged young people to restrict public \naccess to their social networking profiles. Three of the community workers \nconfirmed that they had received CEOP training from the PSNI and that this \nAmbassador training program was to be rolled out in other interface areas shortly. \nOne of the interviewees stated that their community group intended to send its \nstaff on this course again after it had proved popular in 2009: \n \n\u201cTraining is going to happen in other interface areas, we did Ambassador \ntraining and we intend to do it again.\u201d \n      (West Belfast community worker 1) \nThis Ambassador training would allow these community workers to cascade \nthe ThinkuKnow program to young people aged 11\u201316 years in their respective \nareas, in much the same fashion as the bespoke Internet Safety lessons provided \nby the PSNI in local schools. \n \n3. Key Stakeholders Feel that Internet Safety Campaigns are Effective But \nMay Not Reduce the Level of Anti-Social Behavior in Interface Areas \n \nThe consensus among the interviewees was that these campaigns had been well \nreceived by people in Northern Ireland, but were unlikely to stop young people \nusing sites such as Bebo to organize anti-social behavior. While by the very \nnature of their work these stakeholders might be expected to report that these \ncampaigns were successful, this was a persuasive theme throughout all of the \ninterviews. For example, the PSNI Educational Officer reported that they had \nreceived positive feedback from the public about their \u201cbespoke lessons\u201d in \nInternet Safety: \n \n\u201cThe public are very receptive to having appropriately trained PSNI officers \ndelivering talks and lessons on Internet Safety.\u201d \n(PSNI Educational Officer) \n16\nPolicy & Internet, Vol. 3 [2011], Iss. 1, Art. 7\nhttp:\/\/www.psocommons.org\/policyandinternet\/vol3\/iss1\/art7\nDOI: 10.2202\/1944-2866.1071\n \nThree of the community workers suggested that strategies to promote safe \nand responsible use of social networking sites would have little or no impact on \nthe level of anti-social behavior in interface areas. SMS text messaging was said \nto be as important a tool of communication for young people who participated in \nanti-social behavior such as street riots in interface areas: \n \n\u201cTexting, [sic] to a lesser extent social networking sites, are being used to \narrange these sorts of activities.\u201d \n      (North Belfast community worker 2) \n \n\u201cBebo would be one of the means of doing it [organizing street riots]. \nMobile phones another one, text messages and stuff.\u201d \n(East Belfast community worker 2) \n \nThe consensus among these stakeholders was that young people were \nlikely to organize anti-social behavior using other communication tools if their \naccess to sites such as Bebo was restricted. Yet, the preceding literature review \nsuggests that Internet Safety programs are not intended to prevent young people \nfrom using sites such as Bebo to organize violence in their areas. Rather, the focus \nof programs such as ThinkuKnow is on cyberbullying, the risks faced by young \npeople in revealing sensitive personal information on social networking sites, and \nthe risks of online sex predators. Therefore, it is perhaps no surprise that efforts to \npromote responsible social media usage among young people using these training \nmaterials are unlikely to remedy the problem of anti-social behavior organized via \nsocial networking sites. Rather, the evidence presented by community workers in \nthis exploratory study provides support for Leonard\u2019s (2010) assertion that \nrecreational violence cannot be divorced from the political context in which its \npractitioners grow up. The drama workshops organized by the PSNI in \nconjunction with local councils and schools may prove more useful than Internet \nSafety programs in developing an understanding of the motivations of teenage \nrioters and informing policy in this area. \n \nConclusion \n \nThis preliminary study suggests that, on the basis of the evidence to date, \nstakeholder awareness about the extent of the use of social media by young people \nto organize street riots is based on rumor and hearsay. Key stakeholders report \n17\nReilly: Policy Responses to Anti-social Networking in Northern Ireland\nPublished by Berkeley Electronic Press, 2011\nthat Internet Safety programs such as ThinkuKnow have received positive \nfeedback from local audiences, but concede that they are unlikely to have any \nsignificant impact upon the level of anti-social behavior in interface areas. The \nconsensus among the interviewees was that this form of anti-social behavior could \nbe organized via SMS text messaging if sites such as Bebo were no longer \navailable to young people situated in or around interface areas. Moreover, the \nfindings presented in this study resonate with the suggestions by Hampton (2004) \nand Carter (2005) that social media have become integrated into the daily lives of \npeople and that online and offline relationships are increasingly blurred. The use \nof social media to organize recreational rioting in interface areas is likely to \ncontinue sporadically until such time as the causes of this anti-social behavior are \naddressed in these contested geographical areas. \nThere are two issues that emerge from this preliminary study that merit \nfurther investigation. First, the perspectives of young people should be explored in \nrelation to the use of social networking sites to organize anti-social behavior in \ninterface areas. With the exception of the Lloyd and Devine study (2009), most \nrecent empirical studies in Northern Ireland have tended to focus on adult \nperspectives on Internet Safety and have neglected the attitudes of young people \ntowards social media. In addition, much of the recent work on young people in \ninterface areas has tended to focus on their anti-social behavior, with little \nemphasis placed on their reported use of new media to threaten members of rival \ninterface communities (Leonard 2008; 2010). \nSecond, further research is needed to examine the extent to which the \nstakeholder perspectives discussed in this exploratory study are yet another legacy \nof the conflict. Several of the interviewees stated that they did not feel \ncomfortable using the Internet, and that youth workers might have a greater \nawareness of the social networking practices of young people in Northern Ireland \nthan the older community workers. This finding resonates with the evidence from \nthe recent Ofcom Adult Media Literacy Audit (Ofcom 2010a) that suggested that \nNorthern Irish adults remain cautious about the Internet and report low levels of \ntrust in new media technologies in comparison to their peers in the rest of the \nUnited Kingdom. This proposed work would also provide further evidence as to \nthe potential role of new media in promoting positive intercommunity \nrelationships in contested interface areas such as North Belfast. \n \n \n \n18\nPolicy & Internet, Vol. 3 [2011], Iss. 1, Art. 7\nhttp:\/\/www.psocommons.org\/policyandinternet\/vol3\/iss1\/art7\nDOI: 10.2202\/1944-2866.1071\nAppendix 1 \n \nInterview Schedule for Community Workers. \n \nQ1: How important is the Internet as a tool for residents\u2019 groups? \n \nQ2: How do new media technologies fit into your general communication \nstrategy? \n \nQ3: What impact do you think social networking websites have had on \ncommunity relations in NI in general?\u2014positive and negative. \n \nQ4: What impact do you think social networking websites have had on attitudes \nof young people in NI? \n \nQ5: Can you tell me about any incidents of Bebo being used to organize anti-\nsocial behavior in this area?  \n \nQ6: How were you made aware of this activity? \n \nQ7: Could you tell me a bit about your strategies to prevent so-called \n\u201crecreational rioting\u201d in this area? \n \nQ8: To what extent do you monitor Bebo?
