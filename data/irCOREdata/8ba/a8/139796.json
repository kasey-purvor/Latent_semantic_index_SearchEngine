Introduction \nThermal barrier coatings (TBCs) are an enabling materials technology for advanced gas \nturbine engines as they expand the operating temperature capability of metallic components [1, 2] \nwith attendant benefits to the engine fuel efficiency and environmental impact.  A typical TBC \nsystem (Figure 1) comprises multiple layers with distinct but complementary functionalities [3].  \nThe Ni-based superalloy component (often an internally cooled turbine blade or vane) is the load-\nbearing member of the system.  Thermal protection is provided by the \u201ctop coat,\u201d a 100-300\u00b5m \nlayer of 7wt.% yttria-stabilized zirconia (7YSZ) applied either by electron-beam physical vapor \ndeposition (EB-PVD, as in Figure 1) or atmospheric plasma spray (APS) [2].  The coating \nmicrostructure is tailored to be \u201cstrain tolerant\u201d by promoting columnar grains with open boundaries \n(EB-PVD) or microcracking of splats (APS) [3].  Incorporation of porosity during deposition \nreduces further the inherently low thermal conductivity of the 7YSZ thermal barrier [4-6].   \nSince 7YSZ is an oxygen conductor and contains extensive porosity, oxidation protection \nmust be built in by other means, namely through a thin, dense, and continuous \u201cthermally grown\u201d \naluminum \u03b1-Al2O3 oxide layer (TGO in Figure 1) [7].  Zirconia generally bonds well to alumina at \nhigh temperature, and thus, the TGO also provides a strong foundation for the thermal barrier [8].  \nSince superalloy compositions are not typically optimized for oxidation resistance, their surfaces are \nchemically modified to produce a sound, durable TGO [3, 9].  This modified metallic layer is \nknown as the \u201cbond coat\u201d (BC) and is generally based on one or more of the intermediate Ni-Al \nintermetallic phases, most notably \u03b2-NiAl (B2) or \u03b3\u2019-Ni3Al (L12), with other elements in solid \nsolution [10-15].  The ability of the bond coat to support the TGO is sensitive to initial processing \nprocedures and subsequent in-service thermal cycling because its chemistry constantly changes due \nto oxidation and interdiffusion with the substrate [15-22]. \n  3\nOf particular interest to this study are the single phase (B2) Pt-modified NiAl-based bond \ncoats that have been shown to outperform conventional (B2) NiAl for high temperature TBC \nsystems [23, 24].  These BCs are fabricated by first plating the Ni-base superalloy with a thin layer \nof Pt (~5-7\u00b5m thick) followed by annealing at high temperature to partially diffuse the Pt into the \nsubstrate, and then aluminizing to produce the desired B2 surface layer [12, 25, 26].  The process \nhas important implications for the substrate in that it draws Ni (as well as Cr and Co) from it to \nform the desired intermetallic phase, promoting the formation of an interdiffusion zone (as in Figure \n1) typically containing carbides and refractory metal-rich phases [9, 10].  The characteristics of the \nBC and interdiffusion zone (IDZ) depend on the activity of the Al applied to the substrate surface \nduring processing [10, 27, 28].  Aluminization conditions where appreciable inward diffusion of Al \ninto the substrate takes place are referred to as \u201chigh activity\u201d processes [10, 27, 28].  These \ngenerally form \u03b4-Ni2Al3 with small amounts of NiAl in the top layer of the BC.  A subsequent \ndiffusion cycle transforms the \u03b4-Ni2Al3 into the more ductile and oxidation resistant B2 NiAl [10, \n27].  Conversely, outward Ni diffusion predominates in \u201clow activity\u201d processes, leading directly to \nthe formation of B2 NiAl [10, 28].   \nWhile the Pt-modified aluminides are attractive from an oxidation perspective, they are also \nprone to \u201crumpling\u201d [12, 18, 20, 29, 30] upon thermal cycling, wherein the TGO develops severe \nout-of-plane displacements that degrade the adherence of the top coat [31, 32]. The \u201crumpling\u201d \nmechanism is complex, motivated by one or more of the following phenomena: (i) \u201cin-plane\u201d \ngrowth of the TGO due to new \u03b1-Al2O3 formation at the grain boundaries [33], (ii) \u201cswelling\u201d of \nthe bond coat owing to the asymmetric interdiffusion fluxes with the substrate [20], and (iii) volume \nchanges associated with phase transformations, which in turn are triggered by compositional \nchanges in the BC as a result of oxidation and interdiffusion [18, 19].  The stresses generated by \nthese constrained dilatations, coupled with those produced by thermal expansion mismatch during \n  4\nthermal cycling, are accommodated by plastic deformation in the bond coat layer [34, 35].  The \nassociated displacements induce separations from the top coat eventually leading to spallation [12, \n18, 20, 29, 30]. \nSusceptibility to rumpling thus depends on the mechanical properties of the bond coat, and \nstrategies for high temperature strengthening of the BC are desirable to suppress this failure mode \n[35, 36].  Ru additions to NiAl present an opportunity for such a strategy [37].  RuAl has the same \nB2 structure as NiAl but its melting point is higher by ~400\u00b0C [38, 39], it has higher strength at \nelevated temperature [40] and exhibits characteristics suggestive of better intrinsic deformability at \nlow temperatures compared to NiAl [41-43].  It has also been proposed that platinum group metals \n(PGMs), such as Ru, can potentially act as diffusion barriers preventing the migration of detrimental \nelements toward the BC\/TGO interface [44-46], with attendant benefits to the minimization of \ninterdiffusion effects.  A concern arising from recent investigations, however, is the inadequate \noxidation resistance of monolithic RuAl [47].  For this reason, one would not anticipate using RuAl \nas a bond coat on a Ni-base superalloy without substantial alloying modifications to RuAl, so the \nissue becomes whether Ru additions can improve the mechanical performance of a NiAl-based BC \nwithout impairing its oxidation resistance.  Moreover, if Ru were found effective as a potential \nreplacement for Pt, there would be economic benefits even at comparable performance. \nThe objectives of the present investigation are (i) to define a processing approach for \nfabrication of a Ru-modified aluminide bond coating and (ii) to investigate its oxidation and \ninterdiffusion behavior in the context of the potential application into a TBC system.  The \ninterdiffusion and phase equilibria issues relevant to the fabrication of these interlayers were \ninvestigated in detail.  The evolution of coating microstructures at various stages of the fabrication \nprocess was studied, and observations of the cyclic oxidation resistance of these Ru-modified \naluminide bond coats are presented. \n  5\n2. Experimental Procedures \n2.1 Materials  \nSubstrates were cut from single crystal plates of CMSX-4TM with composition, including \nminor element impurities, listed in Tables 1 and 2, respectively.  The C and S content were \nmeasured by combustion analysis while O and N were determined by the inert gas fusion thermal \nconductivity method, both following ASTM Standard E1019-03 [48].  Zr and B were measured \nusing direct current argon plasma atomic emission spectrometry in accordance with ASTM \nStandard E1097-03 [49].  Impurity analyses were performed by Sherry Laboratories in Muncie, IN.   \nThe plates were sliced by electro-discharge machining (EDM) into coupons measuring \napproximately 3mm in thickness.  The EDM surfaces were glued to the base plate of a flat surface \ngrinder.  The sides of each coupon were ground to 25mm x 57mm and the surfaces to be flat and \nparallel.  Superalloy surfaces in contact with the casting mold as well as EDM heat-affected areas \nwere removed during the grinding process.  The surface grinder was set to remove 2.5\u00b5m of \nmaterial per pass to avoid excess damage to the superalloy.  The coupons were washed in acetone to \nremove any remaining glue and residue from the grinding process.  Each coupon was then grooved \npart way through its thickness to form two square areas of 25mm x 25mm on the top area of each \nbar and polished by hand from 240 grit to 800 grit SiC paper.  Each coupon was washed multiple \ntimes in acetone to remove residues from the preparation process.  The final thickness of each \ncoupon was nominally 3mm.   \n2.2 Coating Deposition  \nRu was deposited on the top (grooved) surfaces of the coupons using electron beam physical \nvapor deposition (EB-PVD).  The substrate temperature varied during deposition from an initial \n(preheating) value of 475\u00b0C to approximately 500\u00b0C.  A Ru layer approximately 7\u00b5m thick was \ndeposited on each substrate at a rate of 30-40 nm\/s.  The coupons were then annealed in Ar, heating \n  6\nat 8\u00b0C\/min to 1100\u00b0C, holding for 1h and then cooling at 10\u00b0C\/min.  Some specimens were given \nadditional anneals at 1100\u00b0C for durations totaling 4h and 16h to characterize the kinetics of Ru \nredistribution and ascertain the most desirable treatment prior to aluminization.  The selected \nannealing time was 4h. \nOne set of coupons was aluminized by a low activity chemical vapor deposition (CVD) \nprocess following standard practices for bond coat production [25].  Samples generated in this \nmanner received only a 1h anneal prior to aluminization because they were to spend nearly 3h at \nelevated temperature before the actual aluminization began.  The effective annealing time was thus \nequivalent to the desired 4h.   \nA second set of coupons was annealed for the full 4 hours at 1100\u00b0C and then aluminized for \n25 minutes at 1050\u00b0C by a high temperature, high activity pack-aluminization process.  These \nsamples were individually sealed in quartz ampoules back-filled with argon and given a recovery \ntreatment of 2h at 1120\u00b0C, followed by 24h at 825\u00b0C as described in reference [27].  The heating \nrate was 100\u00b0C\/h, the intermediate cooling rate was 100\u00b0C\/h, and the final cooling to room \ntemperature occurred at 50\u00b0C\/h.   \n2.3 Oxidation  \nPreliminary cyclic oxidation studies in air were carried out on both low and high activity \nsamples.  Specimens for this study excluded the application of a thermal barrier to enable \nobservation of the microstructural evolution and oxidation behavior of the bond coat surface in \nplan-view.  \nCoupons were sectioned into 10mm x 10mm square samples.  The sides and bottom of each \nsample were hand polished to 800 grit to reveal the superalloy substrate while only the topside \nremained in its as-aluminized state (as these smaller coupons were cut from large ones and not all \nsides of each specimen were exposed the aluminization treatment).  After cleaning in acetone the \n  7\nsamples were placed on curved alumina platens in a conventional bottom-loading cyclic oxidation \nfurnace.   The oxidation cycle was modeled after that of Meier and co-workers [50] and consisted of \nramping to 1100\u00b0C in 10 minutes, followed by an isothermal dwell period of 45 minutes at 1100\u00b0C \nbefore cooling to 100\u00b0C in 10 minutes.  Exposures included 15, 30, 60, and 120 cycles for the low \nactivity samples and 15 and 30 cycles for the high activity specimens.  The development of the \noxide scale on the Ru-modified coatings and the extent of interdiffusion with the substrate were \nstudied in detail in each of the cyclically oxidized samples. \n2.4 Characterization  \nAs-processed and oxidized specimens were examined in cross-section by electron \nmicroprobe analysis (EMPA) as well as by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in secondary \nelectron (SE) and backscattered electron (BSE) modes.  A focused ion beam (FIB) instrument was \nused to machine out areas of interest for TEM study from the low activity as-aluminized specimen, \nas illustrated in Figure 2.  Evidence of residual stresses within the individual coating layers was \nobserved during TEM sample preparation, consistent with the expected changes in CTE as a result \nof the chemical gradients within the bond coat.  Note, for example, the bending of the thin FIB \nsample the NiAl topcoat layer in Figure 2 as it was released from the surrounding material.  Tilting \nexperiments were carried out to generate diffraction patterns of the major constituent layers of the \nlow activity coupons.  FIB specimens were prepared at the Campus Electron Optics Facility at the \nOhio State University, Columbus, OH. \nEach sample surface was analyzed using SEM and X-ray diffraction (XRD), in the as-\naluminized state and after various cyclic oxidation exposures.  XRD was also performed on the high \nactivity samples after the recovery heat treatment.  XRD patterns were generated using Cu K\u03b1 \nradiation in a \u0398\/2\u0398 rotating anode diffractometer.  Operating conditions for the diffractometer were \nset at 40kV and 100nA with a scan rate of 5\u00b0\/min with 0.024\u00b0 steps. \n  8\n3. Results \n3.1. Ru-coating Interdiffusion \nInterdiffusion between the PVD Ru layer and the superalloy substrate was investigated by \nheat treating in Ar to identify the conditions required to produce a desirable microstructure for the \nsubsequent aluminizing step.  Preliminary experiments with a 3\u00b5m PVD Ru coating revealed \npreferential outward migration of Ni so that after 24h at 1100\u00b0C the Ru-rich layer was \u201cburied\u201d \ncompletely under a Ni-rich surface layer.  This phenomenon is illustrated by the BSE image and \ncorresponding composition profile shown in Figure 3, which arguably represents the extreme case \nof \u201clow activity\u201d (zero) aluminization.  By reducing the time to 4h and increasing the thickness to \n~7\u00b5m, the Ru enrichment is retained at the surface, as shown in Figure 4.  XRD analysis confirms \nthat the surface retains the \u03b4-Ru structure up to 16h, although there is a continuous increase in the \nlattice parameters reflecting the progressive intake of elements from the substrate.  Conversely, the \ntotal thickness of the Ru-enriched region is 10-12\u00b5m.  Closer examination of the microstructure and \ncompositional profile in Figure 4 suggests that a new phase, enriched in Al and refractory elements \n(particularly Ta), has formed at the interface between the \u03b4-Ru and the superalloy.  This Al-rich \nlayer appears to prevent Ta from migrating to the surface. \n3.2. As-aluminized Microstructures \nMicrostructures and composition profiles of the as-aluminized coatings using the low \nactivity and high activity processes are shown in Figure 5.  In both cases the structure consists of \ntwo dominant layers with the B2 structure, one based on NiAl and the other on RuAl.  However, the \nlow activity (LA) coating has the NiAl layer at the surface and the RuAl layer underneath (Figure \n5a), whereas the order is reversed in the high activity (HA) process (Figure 5b).  Moreover, XRD of \nthe as-aluminized surfaces shows the presence of only single phase B2 in the LA coating, but a \nvariety of intermediate\/intermetallic second phases in addition to RuAl for the HA coating.  These \n  9\nsubsequently undergo dissolution during the annealing treatment, as discussed later.  Additionally, \nthere are significant differences in the physical appearance of the surfaces, the HA samples showing \na rougher surface on a finer scale than the LA coatings, as evident in the cross sections of Figure 5b \nand the top views in Figure 6.  The grain sizes of the LA surface layer range from ~20\u00b5m to >60\u00b5m \n(Figure 6a), whereas that of the HA surface appear to be much smaller (Figure 6b).   \nThe EMPA composition profiles in Figure 5a reveal an abrupt and opposite change in the \nconcentration of Ni and Ru in the transition region between the two layers for both coatings.  The \nbulk of the NiAl layer contains no significant Ru in either case, but the RuAl layer does contain Ni \nin solid solution.  Moreover, the Al content is hypostoichiometric at all points in the LA coating but \nsubstantially hyperstoichiometric in the HA RuAl layer.  Other elements from the substrate diffuse \ninto the bond coat region with Ni, as typical of aluminizing processes.  For the low activity coating \nthe refractory elements (W, Mo, Re and especially Ta) appear to accumulate in the RuAl region \nclosest to the substrate and are essentially absent in the top layer.  Conversely the Co and Cr appear \nto migrate readily through the RuAl layer into the NiAl.  The RuAl appears to act effectively as a \ndiffusion barrier to the heavier, refractory elements while allowing outward transport of Ni, Cr and \nCo during aluminization.  Conversely, the concentration of Cr and Co is somewhat lower and that \nof refractory elements higher in the HA RuAl layer compared with the counterpart NiAl surface \nresulting from the LA process. \nOther microstructural differences are worth noting in Figure 5 beyond the two main B2 \nlayers.  First, a typical (albeit thin) interdiffusion zone (IDZ) characterized by the presence of \nsecond phases rich in refractory elements [10] is evident in the HA coating between the substrate \nand the NiAl layer (Figure 5b), but no such zone is present in the corresponding LA coating.  \nInstead, the refractory elements appear to accumulate in solid solution in the lower part of the RuAl \nlayer, as noted previously.  The total thickness of the modified layer, including the IDZ, is then \n  10\nsubstantially greater for the HA than for the LA coating, ~55\u00b5m versus ~35\u00b5m, respectively.  Also \nnotable is the formation of a distinct second phase layer, tentatively identified as based on the \nHeusler phase Ru2AlTa [46, 51], between the NiAl and RuAl layers in the HA coating (Figure 5b) \nbut not in the LA coating.  Conversely, the LA coating exhibits intermittent elongated second \nphases rich in Co, Cr and Re within the Ru-rich layer of the as-aluminized specimen ~26-28\u00b5m \nbelow the surface of the coating (Figure 5a).  As will be shown later by the oxidation experiments, \nthese particles persist over time, whereas the Ru2AlTa phase in the HA coating dissolves into the \nsurrounding B2 layers.  About 20\u00b5m below the surface in the LA coating there is another plane of \nsmall, dark particles delineating the original position of the Ru surface prior to aluminization.  This \n\u201cmarker\u201d provides insight into the relative extent of inward and outward diffusion during \naluminization.  A comparable \u201cmarker\u201d layer does not exist in the HA coating as the original Ru-\nrich surface continues to exist as the surface in the aluminized product. \nTEM analysis of the as-aluminized LA coating in Figure 7 confirms the B2 structure of the \nNiAl and RuAl regions in Figure 2. The top NiAl layer (Figure 7a) had a lattice parameter of \n0.288nm, consistent with XRD analysis of the surface and in the range of typically accepted values \nfor NiAl [52].  Deviation from the nominal NiAl lattice parameter is ascribed to the presence of \nadditional elements in solid solution, as noted before (Figure 5a).  The image in Figure 7a also \nreveals extremely fine nano-scale second phases within the NiAl layer, likely precipitated during \ncooling.  The SAD patterns taken from this region exhibit double diffraction from the embedded \nnano-particles, particularly in the [011] beam direction, but the scale was too small to conclusively \nascertain their structure and composition. \nThe Ru-rich B2 region was found by XRD to have a lattice parameter in the range of 0.300-\n0.304nm, again influenced by the presence of elements in solid solution.  A bright field image and \ncorresponding diffraction patterns of this interlayer confirm the B2 structure of this layer (Figure \n  11\n7b).  This region also contained some nano-sized spheroidal particles, larger than those observed in \nthe NiAl topcoat but still too fine to resolve by conventional TEM analysis methods.  As in the NiAl \nlayer, the SAD patterns contain extra spots, particularly in the [011] zone axis, consistent with \ndouble diffraction from the second phase particles. \n3.3. Evolution of the Low Activity Coating \nThe changes in the microstructure and composition profiles for the LA coating with \nincreasing number of cyclic oxidation exposures are given in Figure 8.  It is first noted that at no \npoint is there an IDZ similar to that formed in a comparably processed Pt-modified aluminide BC.  \nHowever, a thin layer of \u03b3\u2019-Ni3Al appears between the substrate and the RuAl B2 layer after 15 \ncycles (barely visible in Figure 8a) and continues to grow over time to ~5\u00b5m after 120 cycles \n(Figure 8d).   \nThe NiAl and RuAl B2 layers remain very distinct with abrupt reciprocal changes in the \nconcentration profiles of Ru and Ni across the interface between them.  The NiAl layer grows from \na thickness of approximately 14\u00b5m in the as-aluminized condition (Figure 5a) to 20-22\u00b5m in \nthickness after 15 cycles of oxidation (Figure 8a) and then remains approximately between 20-\n22\u00b5m through 120 cycles (Figure 8e).  Conversely, the RuAl interlayer shrinks with increasing \noxidation time, from 20-22\u00b5m in the as-aluminized state to only 12-15\u00b5m after 120 cycles.  \nAfter 15 cycles of oxidation at 1100\u00b0C, a continuous TGO has formed on the surface of the \nNiAl-rich layer and is 2-3\u00b5m in thickness (Figure 8a).  The TGO does not appear to grow \nsignificantly after 30 cycles (Figure 8b) but becomes discontinuous after 60 cycles as a result of \nspallation.  Examination of the corresponding surfaces is presented in Figure 9, where the scale is \nseen to be continuous up to 30 cycles.  The grain boundaries of the underlying NiAl layer are \nclearly visible after 15 cycles (Figure 9a) and somewhat less after 30 cycles (Figure 9b).  TGO \ncracking and spallation is observed after 60 cycles, with debris clearly noted on the surface (Figure \n  12\n9c).  The remaining TGO appears to be slightly thicker at this point, in places approaching 5\u00b5m in \nthickness (Figure 8c).  Spallation becomes even more pronounced after 120 cycles, with voids \nevident at the exposed surfaces of the bond coat (Figure 9d).  \nThe Al concentration near the bond coat surface decreased from ~42at% to ~33at% after 15 \ncycles, and then remains near this level for the rest of the exposures.  This Al decrease is attributed \nto the formation of oxide scale accompanied by some additional outward diffusion of Ni, Co and \nCr.  The Co and Cr concentration in the NiAl layer remains essentially constant at ~10% between \n15 and 120 cycles.  Only about 2at% Ru has diffused to the NiAl\/TGO interface after 15 cycles but \nthe level gradually increases up to ~8% after 60 cycles, with much of the NiAl layer showing an \nessentially constant Ru concentration at that point.  Refractory elements, however, remain at trace \nlevels near the NiAl\/TGO interface even after 120 cycles suggesting that the RuAl interlayer retains \nits function as a diffusion barrier for these elements from the substrate. \nThe intermittent particles rich in Co, Cr, and Re seen in the as-aluminized condition have \ngrown slightly after 15 oxidation cycles and form a nearly continuous layer across the coating, \napproximately 35\u00b5m below the TGO surface (Figure 8b).  These particles do not appear detrimental \nto the coating; however, some cracking within the RuAl layer appears approximately 25\u00b5m below \nthe TGO surface.  These cracks (Figure 8b) are apparently caused by preparation of the specimens \n(as they do not appear in all samples), and are likely driven by the accumulation of thermal stress \nwithin the RuAl interlayer. The semi-continuous layer of bright particles within the RuAl begins to \nbreak down, apparently by dissolution, after 30 cycles (Figure 8b) but still remain after 120 cycles \n(Figure 8d). \nXRD analysis of the coating surface was performed at each stage of the processing and \noxidation to aid in identification of phases present as the coating structure evolves at elevated \ntemperature.  The structure of the metallic phase at the surface remains single phase B2 throughout \n  13\nthe 120 oxidation cycles, with additional reflections consistent with the presence of \u03b1-Al2O3.  Table \n3 gives the lattice parameter (\u00c5) of the Ru-modified NiAl LA bond coating at the various stages of \noxidation exposure in comparison to the accepted lattice parameter values of the B2 compounds \nNiAl and RuAl.  Note that in spite of the evident incorporation of Ru, Cr, and Co and the loss of Al \nthe lattice parameter of the B2 phase deviates only slightly from that of the stoichiometric NiAl. \n3.4. Evolution of the High Activity Coating \nThe evolution of the microstructure and composition profiles in the HA coating is depicted \nin Figure 10.  The first stage prior to oxidation is the recovery annealing treatment (Figure 10a) and \nthe most evident changes are the dissolution of the band of Ru2AlTa precipitates evident after \naluminization (Figure 5b), and the significant growth of the refractory metal-rich IDZ from ~5 to \n~25\u00b5m.  The thickness of the topmost RuAl layer does not appear to change much during this \ntreatment, remaining on the order of 25\u00b5m, but the NiAl region including the matrix of the IDZ \nreaches nearly 50\u00b5m (25\u00b5m being predominately NiAl and 25\u00b5m being the refractory-rich IDZ) for \na total coating thickness of approximately 75\u00b5m following the recovery heat treatment (Figure 10a).  \nA thin TGO has formed even though the treatment was performed in Ar. \nThe EMPA profiles also show that the Ru and Ni concentrations across the RuAl\/NiAl \nlayers in the HA coating change less abruptly upon thermal exposure compared to the LA coating \n(Figure 10).  Accordingly, the boundary between the two B2 layers becomes more diffuse over \ntime.  Most of the Ru, however, still remains concentrated on the top RuAl-based layer, although \nRu can be found nearly 80\u00b5m away from the surface after 30 cycles of oxidation (Figure 10c).  \nAdditionally, Ni concentrations within the top layer range from 20-40at% at the same point, \ncompared with only 10-20at% after aluminization (Figure 5b).  Refractory-rich as well as Co and \nCr-rich phases have formed over a large area in the IDZ as shown by the particles having bright \ncontrast in the BSE image and the EMPA profile; however, these particles do not appear to extend \n  14\ninto the Ru-rich layer.  The coating thickness after 30 cycles of oxidation is in excess of 100\u00b5m \nincluding the IDZ. \nExamination of the coating surfaces after oxidation (Figure 11) shows that the structure \nretains the rough, granular appearance resulting from aluminization.  The scale of the granular \nfeatures on the surface is quite small, on the order of about 5\u00b5m, compared with the NiAl grains in \nthe LA coating.  XRD confirms that the structure of the top layer remains B2 after the annealing \ntreatment and throughout the multiple oxidation cycles, with only reflections for RuAl and \u03b1-Al2O3 \ndetected in the XRD pattern.  The TGO thickness after both 15 and 30 cycles is approximately 2-\n3\u00b5m; however, it is difficult to accurately ascertain the thickness of the TGO layer due to the rough \nsurface formed by the high activity aluminization process.  A more detailed analysis of the \noxidation characteristics of this HA Ru-modified bond coat will be reported elsewhere. \n4. Discussion \n Two distinct processing paths have been identified for synthesizing Ru-modified bond coats.  \nInvestigations of the resultant microstructures from these two paths reveal that it is possible to \nselectively place a B2 Ru-modified aluminide layer either above or below a B2 NiAl layer within \nthe BC by varying the activity of Al during the fabrication process.  Characterization of the oxidized \nBC microstructures reveals that the B2 bi-layers remain stable throughout extended cyclic oxidation \nexposures at 1100\u00b0C.  Both variants of the Ru-modified BC structures form an \u03b1-Al2O3 TGO during \noxidation whose durability is arguably insufficient for TBC applications but could, in principle, be \nimproved with further modification to the BC system.  Thermodynamic and kinetic issues relevant \nto the fabrication and oxidation performance of these coatings are considered in more detail in the \nfollowing sections. \n \n \n  15\n4.1. Microstructural evolution of Ru-modified bond coatings \nA unique feature of the Ru-modified bond coatings is the presence of two distinct B2 layers \n(Figure 5).  The bi-layer BC microstructure following aluminization suggests that a miscibility gap \nexists between these B2 phases in both the LA and HA coatings.  This observations is at variance \nwith a recent experimental assessment of the Ru-Al-Ni phase diagram at 1100\u00b0C (Figure 12), which \nshows a continuous solid solution between NiAl and RuAl [53].  However, abrupt shifts in Ni and \nRu content at the interface between the two BC layers following aluminization, and the continued \nstability of the adjacent NiAl and RuAl layers in both LA and HA coatings after numerous 1100\u00b0C \noxidation cycles are clearly indicative of the presence of two distinct B2 phases.  The inference is \nthat the miscibility gap is absent in the Ru-Al-Ni ternary, but appears upon incorporation of \nquaternary and higher order additions present into the BC layer as a result of interdiffusion between \nthe aluminized surface layer(s) and the superalloy substrate.   \nThe emergence of a miscibility gap within the B2 field is likely to play a significant role in \nthe microstructural differences resulting from the two distinct aluminization paths (Figure 13).  In \nthe LA case (Figure 13a), the occurrence of B2-NiAl overlying B2-RuAl in spite of Ru being \noriginally the outermost layer is a clear manifestation of the outward flux of Ni (as well as Co and \nCr) from the superalloy which occurs during aluminization.  While outward diffusion of Ni is the \ncommon behavior in LA processes, the resultant microstructure in these Ru-bearing BCs is \ndistinctly different from the more conventional and similarly processed Pt-modified aluminide \ncoatings [25].  The depletion of Ni from the outer substrate layer causes the precipitation of Co, Cr, \nand refractory-rich phases which make up the IDZ in conventional BCs [10].  In contrast, the \nincorporation of a RuAl interlayer between the superalloy and the NiAl appears to hinder the \nevolution of the IDZ.  Notably, Ru from the RuAl interlayer is found to diffuse outward into the \nNiAl interlayer faster than inwardly into the superalloy substrate (Figure 8).  Since Ru is thought to \n  16\nsubstitute for Ni in the B2 NiAl lattice [52], the flux of Ni atoms from the substrate to the coating \nsurface, which ordinarily leads to the formation of a conventional IDZ, appears to be partially \ninhibited by Ru atoms occupying Ni sites in the NiAl layer of the BC as interdiffusion occurs.  The \nformation of a Ta-rich intermetallic based on RuAl near the substrate-bond coat interface observed \nin this system has a low solubility for Ni which is in agreement with previous investigations [46].  \nThis low solubility of Ni in Ta-containing RuAl restricts interdiffusion between the BC and the \nsubstrate and limits the precipitation of refractory-rich IDZ phases, thus acting as a buffer layer.  \nOverall, the Ru-modification to the LA coating system appears to modify the interdiffusion between \nthe coating and substrate, thus, preventing the formation of a conventional IDZ and perhaps slowing \nthe development of stresses in the bond coat due to swelling. \nIn the HA coating (Figure 13b), the B2 layers are reversed with RuAl now being the \noutermost BC layer and NiAl located adjacent to the superalloy.  This arrangement of layers results \nfrom the large inward flux of Al from the coating surface during high-activity aluminization. A thin \nIDZ at the BC\/superalloy interface resembling that observed in convetional diffusion aluminide \ncoatings is noted immediately after aluminization.  The Ru-rich top layer of the HA processed \ncoating becomes enriched with increasing amounts of Ni during thermal exposure (Figure 10) \ncompared to the as-aluminized state (Figure 5b).  The solubility of Ni in RuAl (or Ru in NiAl) in \nthe environment of the multicomponent superalloy is an important issue that requires more in-depth \nstudies for optimization of multi-layered systems.   \nThe difference in coating thickness for the two processes is another interesting feature of \nthese Ru-containing bond coatings.  After aluminization, the thickness of the LA bond coat (~36\u00b5m, \nFigure 5a) is thinner than either the HA bond coat (~55\u00b5m thick, Figure 5b) or a similarly processed \nLA Pt-aluminide BC (~60\u00b5m, Figure 1).  The LA Ru-modified bond coating was observed to \nmaintain a nominally consistent thickness since a conventional IDZ did not form during \n  17\naluminization or subsequent cyclic oxidation exposure.  The potential for consuming less base alloy \nfrom a blade or vane during repair prolongs its useful life; thus, the relatively slow interdiffusion \nkinetics in the Ru-containing coatings could result in a further benefit to the airfoil system.  \nThe slow evolution of these two coating structures suggests slow interdiffusion following \naluminization.  This represents a benefit of Ru-modification to TBC system life.  These BCs display \ndiffusion barrier characteristics similar to those observed in Rh-modified coatings which prevent the \noutward diffusion on Ta and W that can degrade the YSZ top coat [45].  Similarly, the Ru-rich \ninterlayer inhibits refractory elements from the superalloy substrate, particularly Ta, from diffusing \nto the BC surface.   \n4.2. Oxidation resistance of Ru-modified coatings systems \nPrevious studies on the oxidation behavior of RuAl alloys [54, 55] suggest that a RuAl-rich \nbond coat may not survive long in an oxidizing environment.   Nevertheless, the oxidation \nmechanism for the Ru-containing interlayers within the BCs fabricated here is substantially \ndifferent from the oxidation mechanism reported for bulk RuAl.  Notably, the diffusion path \noperating during the fabrication of these coatings does not produce the \u03b4-Ru phase, which is known \nto be at the root of the poor oxidation resistance of RuAl alloys [54, 56].  Furthermore, the \u03b4 phase \nis not observed during the course of oxidation of either LA or HA bond coats.  During cyclic \noxidation Ni diffuses into the RuAl-rich top layer making the oxidation of RuAl with varying \namounts of Ni of interest for future studies.  Further investigations and analysis of the HA coating \noxidation will be discussed elsewhere.   \nThe cyclic oxidation studies of the LA coating reveal that the Ni-rich surface produces a \ntypical \u03b1-Al2O3 TGO and offers limited protection for the RuAl-rich underlayer.  However, failure \nof the LA Ru-modified coating occurred in relatively short times compared to Pt-modified \naluminides at similar temperatures [24].  The TGO formed on the LA Ru-containing NiAl BC \n  18\nsurface is only 2-5\u00b5m thick when alumina spallation was observed, while the thickness of the TGO \nin Pt-modified aluminide BC systems can grow to thicknesses upwards of 10\u00b5m before the onset of \nfailure under the same cyclic oxidation conditions [3, 12].  It is apparent that the Ru-containing \nNiAl interlayer oxidizes faster than conventional Pt-modified NiAl and does not exhibit the same \nTGO adherence as observed in Pt-aluminide systems.  While spallation of the TGO occurred after \nonly 60 cycles, no significant BC deformation (i.e., rumpling of the TGO) was observed in these \nRu-modified coatings.  It is likely, however, that the absence of rumpling may be due \npredominantly to the short number of cycles, suggesting that longer oxidation lives may be needed \nbefore one can ascertain conclusively the effects of Ru addition on hindering deformation of the \nbond coat during thermal cycling.   \nTo capitalize on the potential creep strength offered by a RuAl or Ru-modified NiAl \ninterlayer [37], further tailoring of the system response to high temperature oxidation is needed.  \nModification of aluminide bond coats by Pt, Ir, or Rh additions is known to improve the oxidation \nresistance [45, 57], and Pt-additions to bulk RuAl have also been shown to decrease its oxidation \nrate [56].  It is then of interest to consider the possible coating scenarios where Pt-modification \ncould be utilized in conjunction with RuAl-containing interlayers in order to create a BC layer that \nis both creep and oxidation resistant with the ability to prevent the diffusion of refractory elements \nfrom the superalloy substrate to the BC\/TGO interface.  These ideas will be explored in a \nforthcoming publication. \n5. Conclusions \n\u00be Two processing paths for fabrication of multi-layered Ru-modified B2 bond coats have been \nidentified. \n  19\n\u00be The chemical composition and arrangement of these bond coat multi-layers has been shown \nto be process dependent:  low activity CVD processing results in a NiAl outer layer, while \nhigh activity pack-aluminization produces a RuAl outer layer. \n\u00be The distinct B2 layers arise from a miscibility gap that appears to be stabilized by quaternary \nand higher order elemental additions diffusing into the bond coat from the superalloy \nsubstrate. \n\u00be In the low activity bond coating, the Ru-modified layer serves as a diffusion barrier that \nregulates the flux of elements contained in the substrate through the bond coat. \n\u00be The Ru-modified low activity bond coating does not exhibit an interdiffusion zone \ncharacteristic of similarly produced Pt-modified aluminide bond coatings, and overall, is \nthinner by comparison. \n\u00be The outer layers of the each bond coating form \u03b1-Al2O3 upon exposure to high temperatures \noffering initial oxidation protection for the interlayers and the superalloy substrate.   \n6.
