Introduction\nPerformance measurement is a fundamental cornerstone of modern management.\nJohnson (1972, 1975, 1978, 1981) from his studies of early manufacturing enterprises,\ncame to the conclusion that its predecessor, management accounting, was a key\nenabler for the creation of modern manufacturing companies. It enabled the costing\nand co-ordination of production in multi-product wage paying factories; requirement\nnot previously needed by cottage industries or domestic production systems.\nHowever, management accounting was also credited with the near destruction of\nWestern manufacturing business (Hayes and Abernathy, 1980; Johnson and Kaplan,\n1987) and the search for more appropriate tools led to the development of more\nbalanced approaches to performance measurement (Lynch and Cross, 1991;\nFitzgerald et al, 1991; Kaplan and Norton, 1992, 1996).\nIn the last two decades, significant effort has been directed at the development of\nprocesses for the design and implementation of performance measurement systems\n(Bitton, 1990; Eccles and Pyburn, 1992; Kaplan and Norton, 1993, 1996, 2000; Neely\net al, 1996, 2000; Olve et al., 1999) and assessment of their fitness for purpose (Dixon\net al., 1990; Bititci et al, 1998). However, only recently has a more critical literature\ndeveloped, highlighting the problems with implementing performance measures\n(McCunn, 1998, Bourne et al, 2000, 2003a,b) and the longer-term problems with the\nuse of performance measures (Meyer and Gupta, 1994; Townley et al, 2003)\n3The current state of knowledge in performance measurement includes theoretical and\npractical understanding of the management processes required to design and\nimplement performance measurement systems, and theoretical and practical\nknowledge of the main factors causing these processes to succeed or fail. Although\nwe know how to develop and implement performance measurement systems, there is\na gap in our knowledge: why are some organisations better able to manage through\nmeasurement than others? This research is of particular importance now as\nperformance measurement systems such as the balanced scorecard are becoming\nwidely used. If action does not follow measurement and the benefits are not realised\nmost of the efforts being invested in scorecard implementations will be wasted.\nIn the light of this gap, the present paper aims to contribute to the existing knowledge\non BPM systems by examining what are the factors that affect the ability of\norganisations to manage through measures. In order to identify those factors, we\nreviewed the literature on BPM systems, using a Systematic Review (Tranfield and\nDenyer, 2003). The paper will only focus on the thematic findings of this literature\nreview and is structured as follows: first, the literature review methodology is briefly\ndescribed; second, the thematic findings of our review are outlined; third, conclusions\nare presented, and areas for further research discussed.\n2. Methodology\nA Systematic Review is a novel research methodology characterised as being a\nmethodical, transparent, and reproducible manner of analysing existing literature\n(Cook et al, 1997; Cooper, 1998). This methodology has been used in the medical\nsciences over the last fifteen years and it is now being applied to the management\nfield (Tranfield and Denyer, 2003). A Systematic Review both maps and assesses the\n4relevant literature and provides collective insights through the theoretical synthesis of\na field. Systematic reviews differ significantly from traditional \u201cnarrative\u201d reviews.\nNarrative reviews may often lack rigour, are more susceptible to researchers\u2019 bias,\nand in many cases are not undertaken as a genuine piece of investigatory science\n(Mulrow, 1987; Mulrow, 1994). In contrast, a Systematic Review can be defined as a\ngenuine piece of investigatory science since it clearly specifies how the researcher\nconducts the review, what type of documents she\/he reviews, and where those\ndocuments can be found. This allows other researchers to replicate the investigation.\nThe description of the step-by-step development of the systematic review has been\nomitted for clarity and conciseness. However a detailed presentation of this process\ncan be found in Franco and Bourne (2003). Here the focus is on the method used for\nsynthesising the literature reviewed. Once the search and study selection process\n(which involves the collection of relevant studies related to the topic of research) has\nbeen carried out, the information can be analysed either descriptively or thematically.\nThe descriptive analysis helps to clarify the main characteristics of the field\n(methodologies used, classification of countries and industries studied, etc.). The main\npurpose of the thematic analysis, which consists of synthesising the main outcomes\nextracted from the literature, is to inform future research and practice. This paper only\npresents the latter.\nThe selected articles have been classified by applying Pettigrew\u2019s (1985) framework.\nPettigrew\u2019s framework shows the factors that should be taken into account during a\nchange management process. The framework contains three basic components: a\ncontext component, a process component, and an outcome component. The first\ncomponent, the \u2018context\u2019, involves the identification of the contextual factors that\n5influence or are being influenced by the process or system under examination; in this\ncase a BPM system.\nThe second component, the \u2018process\u2019, involves the exploration of the process itself,\nwhich is seen as a continuous, interdependent, sequence of actions and events, and it\nis used to explain the origins, continuance, and outcome of some phenomena. Here,\nthe process component is defined as the process of introducing a new BPM system\ninto the organization. This process has a design stage, an implementation stage, and a\nuse stage (Bourne et al, 2000). Finally, the third component, the \u2018outcome\u2019, involves\nthe study of the end results of the process under investigation. In this paper, this third\nelement relates to the effects BPM systems produce at different levels of the\norganization.\nThe main idea behind Pettigrew\u2019s framework is that organisational change processes\ncan be better understood using a holistic or contextualist approach instead of a\nsimplistic one, which only focuses on the episodic or on the change project. In a\ncontextualist approach, the contextual factors or categories are linked to the process\nunder observation. BPM systems cannot be fully understood using a narrow analysis\nperspective that only focuses on the single process of designing and\/or implementing\nthe system (e.g. Neely et al, 1995; Bourne et al, 2000). Instead, research on this type\nof systems should use a broad perspective. The review of the literature has been done\nwith this principle in mind and its findings are presented below.\n3. Findings\nA BPM systematic review was developed between April 2002 and March 2003. The\nsystematic review searches produced a total of 1563 studies. However, after applying\n6inclusion and exclusion criteria, and carrying out a quality assessment exercise (for\nfurther details on this see Franco and Bourne, 2003) only 337 were included in the\nreview. Of that list, only 73 studies that were considered to be relevant by the panel\nreview have been used here.\nFor presenting the findings of the thematic analysis, we use the framework presented\nin Fig.1. It is based on Pettigrew\u2019s (1985) framework. The model is described in two\nphases. First, the different process and contextual factors that affect organisational\noutcomes are presented. Second, the potential impact of the use of BPM system on\norganisational outcomes is discussed.\nTake figure 1\n3.1. Process factors\nThe main process factors can be subdivided into those factors related to an effective\ndesign of a BPM system, those factors related to an effective implementation of a\nBPM system, and those factors related to the use of BPM systems (Bourne et al,\n2000).\n3.1.1. Effective design of a BPM system\nThere are many factors that enable an organisation to effectively design a BPM\nsystem. The following factors are critical.\n\uf0a7 Performance measurement framework and strategy maps\nMost authors agree on the need for a performance measurement framework such as\nthe Balanced Scorecard, the Performance Prism or similar (Lingle and Schiemann,\n1996; Maisel, 2001; Kaplan and Norton, 1992, 1996, 2001; Johnston et al, 2002;\n7Neely et al., 2002). This framework has the role of providing a clear and balanced\nstructure of the organisation\u2019s key performance dimensions. It has been pointed out\n(e.g. Ahn, 2001) that a BPM framework should be unique to the company involved.\nFurthermore, in recent years, the utilization of \u2018strategy maps\u2019 (Kaplan and Norton,\n2000, 2001, 2004) also known as success maps (Neely and Bourne, 2000) or Action-\nProfit Linkage models (Epstein, 2001), as the basis of the performance measurement\nsystem has increased. According to Kaplan and Norton (2000) strategy maps let an\norganization describe and illustrate its strategic goals, initiatives, targets, performance\nmeasures, and the cause-and-effect relationships among all the pieces of its strategy.\nThese maps formalise the idea proposed by Eccles and Pyburn (1992) regarding the\ncreation of a mental business model as the first step for creating a testable strategy.\nThe purpose of the strategic maps is mainly to facilitate the translation of strategy into\noperational terms (measures); and to help employees get a better understanding and a\nvisual representation of the key factors upon which they need to focus.\nNevertheless, some authors (e.g. Norreklit, 2000, 2003; Ahn, 2001) have critically\nreviewed the apparent benefits of using strategy maps, highlighting issues such as the\nfact that these maps: do not discriminate among logical (e.g. two and two makes 4)\nand causal links (e.g. smoking causes cancer); do not include a possible time lag\namong measures; are overly simple and need to be validated (e.g. through statistical\nanalysis); and ignore the fact that the different measurement perspectives (financial,\ncustomers, internal process, innovation & learning) are not independent so feedback\nloops should be included. Moreover, there is the idea that strategies are continuously\nbeing redefined as the environment changes and knowledge base improves.\nConsequently, there is no need for formal, long-standing strategic plans (Ahn, 2001;\nLorange, 1998). These criticisms add value to our analysis; however, they are not\n8supported by empirical evidence. Therefore it is difficult to assess the real impact of\nstrategy maps.\n\uf0a7 Measures and targets\nAuthors (e.g. Vasconcellos, 1988; Fitzgerald et al, 1991; Moon and Fitzgerald, 1996;\nOtley, 1999; Meliones, 2000; Busby and Williamson, 2000; Ahn, 2001; Kaplan and\nNorton, 2001; Malina and Selto, 2002) also agree on the importance of the\nidentification and selection of the appropriate measures and targets at all levels of the\norganisation. It can be noted that one method of illustrating and plotting the above\nelements in such a way that helps employees and managers understand, which is the\npurpose of a performance measurement framework or of a strategy map; and another\nis choosing the measures and targets that would help the company to implement its\nintended strategy.\nThere are three important aspects regarding measures that have not been well\nresearched in the BPM literature. First, Busby and Williamson (2000) argue that when\ndesigning measures \u201cthere has to be a concern with validity (the extent to which the\nmeasured quantities represent the constructs of interest) and reliability (the extent to\nwhich measurements are repeatable in various ways -for example, whether two\nobservers would observe the same values at the same time)\u201d; also with the fact that\nthere is a strong trade-off between the two. Second, Palmer and Parker (2001), based\non post-deterministic discoveries made in the physical sciences, especially quantum\nphysics, claim that BPM systems should focus on aggregate measures since individual\nmeasurement is pointless. However, their approach is merely descriptive. Third, Ahn\n(2001) suggests that there are a few measurement requirements extracted from the\ndecision-making literature (such as decomposability and non-redundancy) that could\n9apply to the design of performance measures. Nevertheless, these requirements have\nbeen omitted in BPM literature. Overall, as areas of future research it would be worth\nwhile to look at these three aspects.\nMany researchers find that target and milestone setting are critical in a BPM system\ndesign. However, guidelines regarding the identification and selection of these\nelements seem to be insufficient in the literature. Kaplan and Norton (1996), for\nexample, only recommend the use of \u2018stretch targets\u2019 as does Manzoni (2002). Ahn\n(2001) proposes to take into account the interdependencies between the goals for\nquantifying the values of the measures to be attained each year. Johnston et al. (2001),\nin their study of 40 service firms in the UK, argue that most continuous improvement\ntargets were based on past performance; that processes undergoing radical change\nmade limited use of external benchmarks; and that, usually, targets were imposed by\nmanagers without consultation, with rewards linked to the achievement of those\ntargets. These findings have several implications in BPM systems design. For\ninstance, the fact that the lack of participation in target setting could be undermining\nthe team-based empowerment philosophy of most strategies nowadays, and it could\nincrease the level of resistance to the targets, in particular or to a BPM system in\ngeneral. Furthermore, the idea that targets should not always be based on past\nperformance. These few and rather ambiguous guidelines suggest that further research\non this topic would be of great value to the field. In this sense, the accounting\nliterature on setting budget targets (e.g. Murphy, 2000; Merchant and Manzoni, 1989)\ncould be the place to start.\n\uf0a7 Alignment and integration\n10\nAnother factor that performance measurement authors highlight is the need for\nalignment and integration when designing a BPM system (e.g. Bititci et al. 1997;\nGhalayini et al, 1997). When authors stress the need for alignment in a BPM system\nthey normally refer either to:\n- vertical and horizontal alignment, which relates to the integration, linkage and\ncascading of mission, vision, and strategy and through process from supplier to\ncustomer; or to\n- organisational systems alignment, which relates to the integration of a BPM\nsystem with other key management systems such as planning and budgeting,\nrewards, or information systems.\n\uf0a7 Information infrastructure\nA critical factor for the effective design of BPM systems is the process of identifying,\nselecting and developing an appropriate information infrastructure (Eccles, 1991;\nLingle and Schiemann, 1996; Manoochehri, 1999). In this process the following\naspects should be taken into account:\n- The information needs of a BPM system and the procedures and rules to regulate\nthe flow of information should be defined.\n- The appropriate information system should be designed for collecting, analysing\nand reporting the data efficiently. Using an IT system to support these tasks seems\nto be critical (Meliones, 2000; Martins and Salerno, 1999). However, attention\nmust be paid since the capabilities of technology in terms of data capture and\nmanipulation provide a great temptation for senior management to introduce new\nmeasures (Wilson, 2000).\n11\n- Accountability of the measures should be specified (Frigo and Krumwiede, 1999;\nManoochehri, 1999), and as Eccles (1991) suggests, it is recommended that\nmanagers are assigned to each of the measures, or set of related measures and held\nresponsible for developing its methodologies.\nRegarding this factor, it has been noted that many companies that view non-financial\nmeasures as important are not capturing data on these measures (Stivers, 1998). The\nreasons could be the lack of information systems\u2019 capability to collect data or the fact\nthat most of these measures are perceived to be immeasurable or difficult to measure\nand therefore useless (Manoochehri, 1999). Nevertheless, since non-financial\nmeasures have proved their value (e.g. Banker et al, 2000; Ittner and Larcker, 1998)\nthere is a need for investing some effort in developing information systems that can\nactually process the measure of intangibles.\n3.1.2. Effective implementation of a BPM system\nA second set of factors that have an impact on the way organisations use their BPM\nsystem is the one related to the implementation process. Despite the plethora of papers\nand articles on the design of BPM systems, there is a dearth of academic studies\nfocusing on implementation with most of the writing being based on practitioner\nexperience (Bourne et al, 2003a). This phase is crucial as some authors suggest that\n70% of performance measurement interventions fail (Lewy & Du Mey, 1998,\nMcCunn, 1998). Change management issues are certainly a factor (Bourne et al,\n2003b) but these factors have not been well researched in the literature, although their\nimpact can be even greater than the impact produced by the design factors (e.g.\nRoberts and Scapens, 1985).\n12\nImplementation has been defined as the stage in which a BPM system and its\nprocedures are put in place (Bourne et al, 2000). This stage is critical and it should not\nbegin when the design stage finishes. Rather, it should overlap with both the design\nstage and the use stage. According to the literature, the factors that facilitate the\neffective implementation of BPM systems are very similar to the factors enabling\nchange processes to occur (Kaplan and Norton, 2001; Bourne et al., 2003a,b). They\nare:\n\uf0a7 Top manager agreement and commitment\nIn a series of longitudinal studies that focused primarily on performance measurement\nsystems implementations, Bourne et al (2002) identified the main driver of\nimplementation as being management agreement and commitment. Any BPM system\nimplementation, as well as any change management process, should start with a clear\nagreement at the top on the strategy, goals, measures and the performance target to be\nimplemented (Lingle and Schiemann, 1996; Gates, 1999; Maisel, 2001; Kaplan and\nNorton, 2001; Busby and Williamson, 2000). It is expected that top management team\nagreement would increase the level of their commitment and willingness to take the\nlead, which are critical for a BPM system success.\n\uf0a7 The 3 E\u2019s: Empower, enable and encourage\nTo effectively implement a BPM system people must be empowered, enabled, and\nencouraged (Frigo and Krumwiede, 1999).\n- Empower refers to the need for people\u2019s involvement in the development of a\nBPM system. Having the agreement, commitment and leadership at the top is\ninsufficient if it does not go along with the agreement, commitment and leadership\n13\nof the rest of the management team. Furthermore, the involvement of employees is\nalso crucial (Lingle and Schiemann, 1996; Gates, 1999; Maisel, 2001; Johnston et\nal, 2002; Manoochehri, 1999; Boynton and Zmud, 1984). Additionally, it is also\nimportant to involve the Human Resources and the Information System functions\nin the development of a BPM system, since their expertise and knowledge of\npeople management and technology respectively, is extremely useful (Meliones,\n2000; Lorange, 1998).\n- Enable refers to the need for people\u2019s education and training on the measures and\non the related tools and procedures, e.g. data collection, analysis, interpretation,\nuse of IT, etc. (Frigo and Krumwiede, 1999; Maisel, 2001; Kaplan and Norton,\n2001).\n- Encourage refers to the need for actions or activities that actually motivate people\nto use the data provided by a BPM system in their day-to-day work; create the\nright attitude towards the system; and reduce the level of resistance. These actions\ndo not necessarily need to be formal (e.g. communication programmes, which will\nbe discuss below); they can also be informal (e.g. through the example, leadership\nand commitment of the management team).\n\uf0a7 Communication\nCommunication is one of the most cited factors in the literature (e.g. Forza and\nSalvador, 2000, 2001; Keasy et al., 2000). Most authors, when stressing the\nimportance of communication, normally refer to the feedback of the measures\u2019 results\nto the employees. In addition, authors highlight the relevance of verbal and non-verbal\ncommunication (e.g. presentations, manuals, newsletters, reports, etc.) used to clarify\nall the aspects related to the measures in particular and a BPM system in general; and\n14\nto facilitate the buy-in from the people in the organisation (Kaplan and Norton, 2001;\nBourne et al., 2002).\n3.1.3. Effective use of BPM system\nThe literature on the use of BPM system is not as extensive as the literature on the\ndesign of BPM systems. However, a few key factors that enable an organisation to\nbetter manage through measures can be identified.\n\uf0a7 Review and update\nMost authors emphasize the need for a continuous review of the measures themselves,\n(e.g. calculations, data collected) their results, and their impact on goals and strategy\nwith a clear focus on improvement and learning (e.g. Lingle and Schiemann, 1996;\nKaplan and Norton, 2001; Johnston et al, 2002; Neely et al, 2000; Ghalayini and\nNoble, 1996). Furthermore, authors suggest that a continual cleansing and renewal\nprocess of the measures included in the BPM system is required in order to keep them\nrelevant for the organisation and its users (Frigo and Krumwiede, 1999; Manoochehri,\n1999; Bourne et al, 2000; Kennerley and Neely, 2003).\n\uf0a7 Data analysis, interpretation, decision-making and action taking\nManagers must be able to turn data into insights (Neely and Bourne, 2000; Meliones,\n2000; Smith and Goddard, 2002). In order to get insights it is critical to start a data\nreview process with a business question in mind, then look for data that would give an\nanswer to the formulated question, analyse the gathered data, make a decision based\non the data analysis results, and finally, take some action.\n\uf0a7 Rewards\n15\nA factor that has been widely researched in the accounting field but that is still in its\ninitial stage in the literature on BPM systems is the linkage between total rewards and\nBPM systems. The few studies that exist on the impact of rewards on the use of BPM\nsystems conflict in their findings. For instance, Kaplan and Norton (1996, 2001),\nMaisel (2001), Malina and Selto (2002) and Gates (1999), all suggest that the link\nbetween rewards and BPM systems is necessary to encourage the use of the system\nand achieve better perceived results. However, Ho and Mckay (2002) and Ittner and\nLarcker (2003a) argue that the use of the measures in a BPM system for reward\npurposes can increase subjectivity and therefore negatively affect the way in which\nthe system is used.\n\uf0a7 Performance measurement helping tools and management processes\nFinally, studies such as Maisel\u2019s (2001) highlight the importance of developing tools\nand specific management processes that can facilitate the use of performance\nmeasures. Some examples could be the introduction of technical assistance for\nmanagers and employees; the development of quality forums, which can include the\nstandardised measurement and reporting process to address inconsistencies and lack\nof comparative data (Ginsberg and Sheridan, 2001), or a specific process for\nreviewing the measures and ideally to agree action (Bourne et al, 2000).\n3.2. Contextual factors\nOnly a few authors (e.g. Hoque and James, 2000) have paid attention to the contextual\nissues related to BPM systems. Using Pettigrew\u2019s (1985) framework contextual\nfactors have been categorised as internal and external context factors.\n16\n3.2.1. Internal context factors\nRegarding the internal organisational context, most authors agree on the importance\nof firm strategy, culture, organisational size and organisational structure.\n\uf0a7 Firm strategy\nThis factor is probably the most important of all, since a major role of a BPM system\nis to make sure that a firm strategy is being implemented and that it is still valid\n(Kaplan and Norton, 1992, 1996, 2001; Neely, 1998). However as Langfield-Smith\n(1997) argues, our knowledge of the relationship between Management Control\nSystems, including BPM systems, and strategy is limited. Empirical research has\nfound that some strategies, such as the ones that focus on quality are more likely to\nencourage the use of BPM systems than others (Neely et al, 1994; Ittner and Larcker,\n1997). Furthermore, based on studies in the field of strategic control by Goold and\nCampbell (1993) and Lorange (1998), it can be implied that for some companies the\nuse of BPM systems might not be tenable (for example, the ones that manage a\ndiverse portfolio of business which do not share common strategic characteristics or\nthe ones that are continuously looking for new business).\n\uf0a7 Culture\nMooraj et al. (1999) argue that BPM systems can be affected by national culture,\noccupational culture, and corporate culture. Other authors (Lingle and Schiemann,\n1996; Gates, 1999; Maisel, 2001; Lockamy and Cox, 1995; Malina and Selto, 2002;\nJohnston et al, 2002) just suggest that BPM systems should be linked to the culture of\nthe organisation. However, they do not provide any clear definition of what type of\nculture they refer to, nor how this alignment should be developed.\n17\n\uf0a7 Organisational structure and size\nOrganisation structure is a key factor that directly affects the design of a BPM system\nand indirectly the implementation and use of measures (Manoochehri, 1999; Gates,\n1999; Maisel, 2001; Lingle and Schiemann, 1996). For example, Hendricks (1996)\nshows how a large company went through an overhaul of its corporate structure and\ninstituted performance measures appropriate for the new structure. Furthermore,\norganisational size also has an impact on the type of BPM system in use and its\neffectiveness. Hoque and James (2000) specifically analysed the relationship between\norganisational size and Balanced Scorecard. They found that as size increases,\norganizations find it more practical and useful placing greater emphasis on the BSC\nthat supports their strategic decision making.\n3.2.2. External context factors\nOur review shows that few authors have focused their attention on the relationship\nbetween external contextual factors and BPM systems. One reason for the lack of\nresearch in this area could be that researchers make obvious assumptions regarding\ncontextual factors (e.g. that profit and non-profit organisations are different contexts\nso they of course should have different ways of dealing with BPM systems). The few\nauthors looking at contextual factors affecting the use of BPM systems (e.g. Smith\nand Goddard, 2002; Waggoner et al, 1999; Hussain and Hoque, 2002; Hoque and\nJames, 2000) have tended to focus on:\n\uf0a7 Industry characteristics. This factor relates to either monopoly or competitive\nmarket; public sector, regulated sector or competitive sector; and manufacturing\nor service sector.\n18\n\uf0a7 Environment. This factor relates to demand uncertainty, supplier characteristics, or\nthe economy.\n3.3. Impact of BPM system on outcomes\nSo far this review has been based on the assumption that the use of BPM systems\nactually creates value (i.e. satisfaction of stakeholder needs and wants). A BPM\nsystem is thought to create value through the encouragement of the appropriate\nbehaviours, which in turn are supposed to improve performance outcomes. However,\nit has only been recently that authors have started to test this assumption or parts of it.\nFor example, Scott and Tiessen\u2019s (1999) study indicates that work teams having more\ndiverse performance measures (i.e. both financial and non-financial measures or more\ncategories of measures) achieve higher self-assessed performance (relative to\nexpectations). Hoque and James (2000) also found a significant positive relation\nbetween organizational performance and the use of a diverse set of performance\nmeasures related to the four balanced scorecard categories. Sheu and Wacker (2001)\nfound that fundamental manufacturing planning and control procedures improve a\nfirm's performance on both its internal operations as well as external competitiveness\ngoals. Ittner and Larcker\u2019s (2003b) study of 140 financial service firms found that\nfirms which make more extensive use of a broader set of financial and non-financial\nmeasures than firms with similar strategies or value drivers, have higher measurement\nsystem satisfaction and stock market returns. Unfortunately, most of these studies are\nbased on manager or employees\u2019 perception of achieved outcomes; or they only test\nsome aspects of the impact of BPM systems on performance (e.g. the use of diverse\nmeasures). These two issues limit the ability to place substantive interpretations on\ntheir results.\n19\n4. Discussion and conclusions\nThe findings obtained from this systematic review contribute to a better understanding\nof our existing knowledge on BPM systems. Our review suggests that there are eleven\nprocess factors and five context factors that facilitate a more effective use of BPM\nsystems. The process factors have been grouped into three categories: design,\nimplementation, and use factors. The context factors have been classified into internal\nand external factors. Overall, it has been suggested that sixteen factors have an impact\non the way organisations manage through measures (see table A). Based on the\nliterature, among these sixteen factors, the implementation ones are crucial.\nTake Table A\nOur findings have implications for researchers in the area of performance\nmeasurement; as well as for practitioners developing, implementing and using BPM\nsystems in their organisations. For researchers, this list of factors can be used as the\nbasis for further research. Moreover, we have found a number of specific issues\nrelated with these factors that need more investigation such as:\n- the impact of strategy or success maps;\n- certain characteristics of performance measures (e.g. validity, reliability, etc.);\n- clear guidelines for target and milestone setting;\n- relationship between BPM systems and other management systems;\n- information infrastructures that are suitable for capturing non-financial\ninformation;\n- additional context issues; and\n20\n- the linkage between BPM systems and reward practices.\nFor practitioners, these sixteen factors can be used as a checking list of issues to take\ninto account when designing, implementing and using a BPM system. Practitioners\nhaving a broad perspective of factors that affect how an organisation manages through\nmeasures, by focusing not only on process factors but also on context factors, are\nmore likely to improve the effectiveness of their BPM system. However, this\nargument is based on the outputs of a literature review. Further empirical\ninvestigation is needed in order to provide evidence that supports this argument.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank the EPSRC for support of this project through the research grant, Managing\nthrough Measures (grant number GR\/R56136\/01).\nReferences\nAHN, H., 2001, Applying the balanced scorecard concept: an experience report, Long Range Planning,\n34, (4), 441-461.\nBANKER, R.
