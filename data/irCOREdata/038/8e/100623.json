While recent breakthroughs like\nthe demonstration of a high-speed optical modulator in Si [1] bring the concept of transition\nfrom electrical to optical interconnects closer to realization, the base for any silicon photonics,\nnamely a group IV laser source, still waits to be developed. Up to now, the only lasing devices\ndemonstrated in Si are a Raman laser [2] and Si based impurity lasers [3], which essentially lack\nthe advantages associated with the silicon system by requiring an external pump laser source. For\nsilicon as an indirect semiconductor the concept of infrared emitters based on quantum cascade\n(QC) heterostructures, which is very successfully applied to III\u2013V material systems, provides\na promising approach towards a SiGe infrared laser. But despite the successful demonstration\nof infrared electroluminescence (EL) of various wavelengths for p-type SiGe QC structures\n[4]\u2013[6], lasing has yet to be achieved. The build-up of population inversion in order to achieve\nlasing fundamentally depends on the relaxation lifetime of the excited energy level of the lasing\ntransition. Therefore the measurement and optimization of the intersubband relaxation time\nconstitutes a key issue for the realization of a Si cascade laser source. The intersubband hole\nrelaxation time for transitions below the optical phonon energy (Si\u2013Si : 58 meV, Ge\u2013Ge : 36 meV)\nis signi\ufb01cantly larger than 10 ps and therefore is experimentally well accessible [7]. The lifetimes\nfor energies above the optical phonon energies are smaller than 1 ps and are limited by optical\ndeformation potential scattering [8]. So far experiments aimed at the measurement of the lifetime\nof hole intersubband transitions in this energy range suffered from a lack of time resolution [9]\nor from hole heating requiring subtraction of heating contributions in order to gain a value for\nthe relaxation time [8].\nIn this work we present a density matrix (DM) interpretation of the \ufb01rst direct measurement\nof the excited heavy hole (HH) lifetime in the femtosecond (fs) regime for quantum well (QW)\ntransition energies above the optical phonon energy.A four-level model is presented, which forms\nthe base for the simulation of the time evolution of state occupancies on a fs scale and allows a\ndetailed interpretation of the experimental data. Time resolved measurements were performed\nusing the free electron laser (FEL) FELIX at FOM Rijnhuizen. FELIX provides micropulses\nwith full widths at half maximum (FWHM) down to 280 fs and peak powers of 100 MW. The\nmicropulse repetition rate is 25 MHz, \ufb01ve macropulses of 7 \u00b5s duration are provided per second.\nThe FEL power can be reduced to 33 dB by attenuators.\nTwo samples are investigated in this work. Sample 1 for time resolved measurements at\ntransition energies higher than the optical phonon energy was grown pseudomorphically on a Si\n[100] substrate at low nominal temperature (350\u25e6 C). The active region consists of \ufb01ve Si1\u2212xGex\nvalence band QW (widths: 39, 26, 24, 23 and 35 \u00c5; Ge content: 0.42, 0.42, 0.40, 0.37, and\n0.28 respectively) and is p-type doped (5 \u00d7 1017 cm\u22123). This sequence is repeated ten times\nand separated by an undoped 500 \u00c5 Si barrier. The ten QW periods were sandwiched between\n300 nm (100 nm) p-type (2 \u00d7 1018 cm\u22123) bottom (top) contacts. X-ray re\ufb02ectivity measurements\nshow that the actual structural parameters are typically within 1% of the design parameters.\nThe structure was processed into mesa stripes of 7 \u00d7 0.5 mm and contacted with an Al:Si\nmetallization in order to measure the vertical PC. On samples containing similar sets of undoped\nQW with only a thin barrier between the QW series, QC EL has been observed [4].

The bandstructure calculations show that the wavefunction overlap\nbetween HH1 and HH2 in well 1 does not change signi\ufb01cantly when altering\nthe bias voltage. Therefore the relaxation time between those states is stable with\nrespect to a voltage change, which is consistent with the data presented in \ufb01gure 6.\nThe red line (Eqf) indicates the quasi-Fermi level that describes the local\nequilibrium hole distribution.\nthe vanishing darkcurrent [10], electrostatically selfconsistent k.p bandstructure calculations\nhave been performed, providing the dipole matrix elements required for the DM simulations.\nThe bandstructure calculations are based on the diagonalization of a 6 \u00d7 6 Luttinger\u2013Kohn\nHamiltonian and include coupling of the three energetically highest valence bands (HH, light-hole\n(LH), and split-off (SO) bands) due to \ufb01nite in-plane wavevectors as well as strain contributions.\nFurther details on the bandstructure simulation are given in [11].

This p-type doped (1\u00d71018 cm\u22123) sequence is repeated 12 times and separated\nby undoped 100 \u00c5 Si barriers. The 12 QW periods were sandwiched between 300 nm (100 nm)\np-type (2\u00d71018 cm\u22123) bottom (top) contacts. Sample 2 was processed analogue to sample 1.\nThe calculated band structure of sample 2 is shown in \ufb01gure 2. The HH1\u2013LH1 transition energy\nis calculated to be 32 meV. For this sample, pump\u2013probe transmission experiments revealed an\nHH1\u2013LH1 lifetime of 20 ps [12].Verifying this already determined lifetime by photocurrent (PC)\npump\u2013probe experiments aims at directly comparing the results of two different experimental\nmethods and con\ufb01rming the interpretation of the PC data as a direct monitoring of the excited\nstate population.\nExperimentally, the transition energy of sample 1 was determined by voltage modulated\nwaveguide transmission. An externally applied ac voltage (\u00b12V, 50 kHz) modulated the\noccupation of the HH1 state, and the resulting change of the spectrally resolved waveguide\ntransmission was measured via lock-in technique for transversal magnetic (TM) radiation.\nFigure 3(a) shows a clear peak at the calculated HH1\u2013HH2 transition energy. The \ufb01nal HH2\nstate of this transition is strongly con\ufb01ned. Observing the HH1\u2013HH2 transition of the deepest\nQW 1 was thus not possible in our previous PC experiments [10], in which low intensity radiation\nfrom a globar was used for the excitation of the sample. However, because of the nearly equal\nspacing in energy of the HH1, HH2 and the onset of the continuum states in well 1, PC can be\ngenerated by two photon processes. Figure 3 shows the results of PC experiments making use\nof the intense laser radiation of FELIX.

The calculated\nHH2\u2013HH1 energy difference presented in \ufb01gure 1 (160 meV) is consistent with\nthe peak positions measured in voltage-modulated TM transmission experiments\n(a) and in two-photon PC spectra obtained by varying the FEL wavelength (b), (c)\nfor \u00b13V bias). The graphs were offset vertically for clarity. The arrow labelled\npump\u2013pump indicates the energy at which the time resolved measurements were\nperformed.\nThe height of the PC peak induced by a FEL pulse was measured as a function of the\nFEL micropulse energy for TM polarized radiation in order to verify that a nonlinear absorption\nprocess is responsible for the PC signal at the HH1\u2013HH2 energy. For pulse energies smaller than\n3 \u00d7 10\u22122 \u00b5J the data presented in \ufb01gure 4(d) show a clear superlinear dependence of the peak\nmaximum on the pulse energy, which is typical for multi-photon processes. A saturation of the\nPC signal is observed for pulse energies higher than 5 \u00d7 10\u22122 \u00b5J.\nIn order to understand the power dependence of the PC signal over the whole range of\nmicropulse energies as well as the dynamics of the state occupancies, the response of the system\nto a laser pulse resonant with the HH1\u2013HH2 transition was simulated using a DM approach\n[13, 14]. The processes and states included in this model are depicted in the inset of \ufb01gure 4(d).\nThe HH1 and HH2 states are labelled by 0 and 1, respectively. The continuum is modelled by two\nstates (2, 3) only. State 2 represents the continuum state that is resonantly coupled to the HH2\nstate by the radiation \ufb01eld. The relaxation from state 2 into state 3 accounts for the decay from\nthe resonant continuum state into delocalized continuum states not coupled to the QW states by\nthe radiation \ufb01eld but contributing to the measured current.

Spontaneous relaxation from the continuum\nstates (2, 3) into bound states was excluded, as recapturing of charge carriers from the con-\ntinuum into the wells appears on a timescale of 5\u201310 ps, as calculated from the photoconductive\ngain in [10], and thus far exceeds the temporal width of the laser pulse and the timescale of the\nexperiment.\nThe model was further simpli\ufb01ed by applying the rotating wave approximation [15]. As no\ncoherence effects were observed in the experiment, the time derivatives of the slowly varying\ncomponents of the off-diagonal elements were set zero (adiabatic approximation). The resulting\ndifferential equations relating the diagonal elements of the DM to the temporal envelope of\nthe electromagnetic \ufb01eld (in our case Gauss-shaped) were solved for the intensities shown in\n\ufb01gure 4(d) with \u00b510 = 2.6 nm and \u00b521 = 1 nm as calculated from the simulated band structure.\nFor \u03c410 and the FWHM of the laser-pulse the values 550 and 280 fs were used, which have been\nobtained from the pump\u2013pump experiment discussed in the next section. For the phase relaxation\nrates, \u000312, \u000310, \u000320 a value of 5 THz was used, much faster than any other time constant in\nthe model, since experimentally no coherence effects were observed. This value for the phase\nrelaxation rates corresponds to a homogeneous linewidth of the HH1\u2013HH2 transition one order\nof magnitude smaller than the absorption linewidth found in \ufb01gure 3. Note that the absorption\nwidth is determined by inhomogeneous broadening and thus is expected to be signi\ufb01cantly larger\nthan the homogeneous linewidth corresponding to \u000310.

Since the input\u2013output characteristic of the external\ncircuit is linear, the response of the electrical circuit to the micro-pulse train that makes up a\nmacropulse is proportional to the sum over N identically decaying exponentials excited at the\ntimes t0,...,N\u22121 at that the N micropulses hit the sample, provided that the sample relaxes to its\nequilibrium states between subsequent micropulses (from previous experiments, it is known that\nthis occurs on a 10 ps timescale [10]). In our experiment, we integrate the ampli\ufb01er output over\na FEL macropulse by a box-car integrator. Following the preceding discussion it is evident,\nthat this integral is proportional to the system response to a single micropulse, which in turn is\nproportional to the carriers excited into the continuum during one micropulse.

Pump\u2013pump set-up. The FEL beam with a wavelength of 7.9 \u00b5m enters\nthe optical set-up in transverse electric (TE) polarization and is splitted by a beam\nsplitter (B1). The polarization of one of the beams is turned by 90\u25e6 into transverse\nmagnetic (TM) polarization (PR2). The beam remaining in TE polarization is\nre\ufb02ected by a movable mirror (R1) allowing to adjust the delay between TE and\nTM pulse on a fs scale. Before being coupled into the sample waveguide, the\nbeams are made collinear again by the use of a second beam splitter (B2).\nThe integral PC through the variably biased sample originating from the delayed\nTE and TM micropulses is measured as a function of the delay.\nof continuum states. The calculation is in very good agreement with the measurement over\ntwo orders of magnitude of the exciting power. The calculations show, that for low excitation\nintensities HH2 is only weakly populated by the pulse, most carriers remain in HH1. Therefore\nthe continuum occupation depends quadratically on the intensity. As the peak intensity gets\nhigher, the HH1\u2013HH2 transition reaches bleaching (i.e. the HH1 and HH2 populations become\nequal) within the pulse time, and therefore the continuum occupation and the PC become linearly\ndependent on the excitation intensity. For even higher intensities, the occupations of HH1, HH2\nand continuum become comparable, thus the transition to the continuum becomes bleached and\nthe PC saturates.\nThe DM calculations are used to precisely describe the processes involved in PC\npump\u2013pump experiments aimed at quantifying the HH2\u2013HH1 relaxation time, which has been\nreported to be mainly determined by optical phonon deformation potential scattering [8, 16].The\npump\u2013pump set-up is shown in \ufb01gure 5. The advantage of PC measurements over pump\u2013probe\nexperiments lies in their much higher sensitivity. In addition, major set-up problems of pump\u2013\nprobe transmission experiments in waveguide con\ufb01guration, like distinguishing between the\nparallel pump and probe beams, are avoided. The cross-polarization of the FEL beams introduces\nan asymmetry into the experiment with respect to the sign of the delay, and allows an unambiguous\nidenti\ufb01cation of decay processes even if the decay time constant is close to the time resolution\nof the set-up. Furthermore it prevents the two beams from interfering.\nFigure 6 compares the experimental results with the simulation.

Also shown is the result of pump\u2013pump simulations (green\nline) using the same parameters as in the simulation of the power PC dependence\non the micropulse energy shown in \ufb01gure 4(d).\nthe various delays displayed in \ufb01gure 6. In the simulations, the HH2\u2013HH1 relaxation time \u03c410\nwas used as a \ufb01tting parameter. With \u03c410 = 550 fs an excellent agreement between measured and\nsimulated results was obtained (see \ufb01gure 6). Moreover, with this value for \u03c410 also the power\ndependence of the PC can be accurately modelled over three decades of micropulse powers\n(see \ufb01gure 4(d)). This \ufb01nding strongly suggests that all relevant processes are included in the\nsimulation and that the extraction of the parameters, most interestingly the HH intersubband\nrelaxation time, is performed correctly. The interpretation of the experimental data is based on\nthe picture presented in \ufb01gure 4. The strong asymmetry of the curves in \ufb01gure 6 with respect\nto the sign of the delay is due to the strong polarization dependence of the transition involved.\nNegative delays in \ufb01gure 6 present results for cases, in which the TM polarized pulse is the \ufb01rst\nto interact with the sample. In TM polarization the HH1\u2013HH2 transition is allowed, and thus a\nnon-equilibrium population of the HH2 state will build up. This non-equilibrium HH2 occupation\ndecays exponentially with the time constant \u03c410, as presented in \ufb01gure 4(b). From the HH2 state,\nholes can be excited to the continuum also in TE polarization. Therefore, if the TE pulse hits the\nstructure before the HH2 carriers have relaxed, the integral PC increases proportionally to the\nresidual holes in the HH2 state. Thus the measured decay of the integral PC change as a function\nof the pulse delay directly monitors the HH2 lifetime, allowing the extraction of the HH2\u2013HH1\nrelaxation time by performing an exponential \ufb01t for the data in \ufb01gure 6 gained at negative delays.\nIn TE polarization, HH1\u2013HH2 transitions are forbidden at the \u0003 point and become only weakly\nNew Journal of Physics 9 (2007) 128 (http:\/\/www.njp.org\/)\n10 DEUTSCHE PHYSIKALISCHE GESELLSCHAFT\nallowed for HH1 vectors with \ufb01nite momentum perpendicular to the growth direction. Thus\nonly negligible HH2 populations can be excited from the HH1 ground state by a TE pulse. As\na consequence, the HH2 relaxation cannot be observed if the TE pulse arrives \ufb01rst (positive\ndelays in \ufb01gure 6), resulting in an asymmetry with respect to the pulse order as observed in\nthe experiment. The fast decaying increase of the PC signal between 0 and 1.5 ps in \ufb01gure 6\nresults from the overlap of the TE and TM pulse, and thus indicates the time-resolution of the\nexperimental set-up. The extracted HH2\u2013HH1 relaxation time of 550 fs is signi\ufb01cantly longer\nthan the time resolution of the measurement set-up.\nAs already mentioned, our simulation accurately reproduces the experimental results for\nboth kinds of measurements, where the use of one consistent set of parameters, one of which is the\nhole intersubband relaxation time, implies a fundamental understanding of the processes involved\nin the experiments. The extracted HH2\u2013HH1 subband relaxation time \u03c410 is thus highly reliable.\nThe experiment was performed for several bias voltages. However, within the experimental error\nof the lifetimes 3\u03c3 = 60 fs for +3V and 18 fs for \u22125 V no dependence of the lifetime on the\napplied bias could be observed. We believe that this is due to the fact, that according to the band\nstructure calculations presented in \ufb01gure 1 the wavefunction overlap of the HH2 and HH1 states\nof the deepest QW 1 does not change when altering the voltage within the range investigated in\nthe experiments.\nWe report a signi\ufb01cantly longer relaxation time (550 fs) than reported in [8] (250 fs),\nwhere a contribution of hole heating had to be deconvoluted in order to gain this value. In\nour experiment, such heating effects would only enter via a time-dependent development of the\ndistribution function for the excited HH2 population into a Fermi\u2013Dirac distribution described\nby an elevated hole temperature and a HH2 quasi-Fermi level. Calculations indicate a decrease\nof the HH2-continuum absorption at the pump\u2013pump wavelength of 7.9 \u00b5m as a consequence of\nheating. Thus, a deviation from exponential decay and an underestimation of the HH2 relaxation\ntime would result due to heating. However, we want to point out that due to the low excitation\nintensity suf\ufb01cient for our experiments, no deviations from an exponential HH2 decay could\nbe observed. Also in previous work, under the higher intensities required for pump\u2013probe\nabsorption determinations of lifetime, only the heating of the HH1 ground state distribution\nwas subtracted in the analysis and the in\ufb02uence of a hot HH2 excited state distribution was\nneglected [8].\nTo further con\ufb01rm experimentally that PC pump\u2013pump experiments probe the excited\nstate lifetime, we compare time resolved pump\u2013pump measurements on sample 2, for which a\nHH1\u2013LH1 transition time of 20 ps was reported in [12], with conventional pump\u2013probe\nexperiments in transmission at photon energies below the optical phonon energy. Figure 7 shows\nthe result of PC pump\u2013pump measurements at a FEL wavelength of 37.9 \u00b5m, a macropulse\nenergy of 70 \u00b5J and an attenuation of 13 dB (red line), where the FEL beams hit the sample\nsurface normally (both beams TE polarized, but cross-polarised). The side peaks found in the\nexperimental data at \u00b115 ps originate from the overlap of the second beam with the fraction of\nthe \ufb01rst beam re\ufb02ected by the sample\u2019s back surface. The 15 ps delay are consistent with the\nsample thickness of 600 \u00b5m. The re\ufb02ection of the \ufb01rst pulse is included in the \ufb01t presented in\n\ufb01gure 7, which reveals a HH1\u2013LH1 relaxation time of 16 ps in good agreement with the value of\n20 ps reported in [12]. Due to the absence of any long-term decay as present in the pump\u2013probe\ntransmission experiments reported in [12], the relaxation time \ufb01t in \ufb01gure 7 can be performed\nover double the time range in comparison to the data in [12], while the signal-to-noise ratio\nis comparable.

Due to the consistency\nachieved in modelling and experiment, the HH2\u2013HH1 lifetime, that for sample 1 is limited by\nthe optical deformation potential scattering [8], is highly reliable and can be extracted directly\nfrom the observed decay of the pump\u2013pump signal as a function of the delay between TM and TE\npulses. In our experiment, we obtained 550 fs for this lifetime, approximately two times larger\nthan reported previously [8]. In addition, the experiment described in this work in principle allows\nthe measurement of the excited state lifetime of a QCL structure. A direct comparison of PC\npump\u2013pump measurements with pump\u2013probe experiments in transmission was accomplished\nby verifying the LH1\u2013HH1 relaxation time of sample 2 reported in [12]. The value of 16 ps for\nthe relaxation time of sample 2 lies in the experimentally well accessible time range of transition\nenergies below the optical phonon energy. As our experiments were not restricted to this time\nrange and were performed on biased devices, our results constitute a key step in the design\nand dynamic simulation of SiGe QC laser structures. Pump\u2013pump PC measurements on sample\n2 con\ufb01rmed the LH1\u2013HH1 relaxation time with a transition energy below the optical phonon\nenergy determined in transmission pump\u2013probe experiments in [12].\nNew Journal of Physics 9 (2007) 128 (http:\/\/www.njp.org\/)\n12 DEUTSCHE PHYSIKALISCHE GESELLSCHAFT\nAcknowledgments\nWe gratefully acknowledge the support by the Stichting voor Fundamenteel Onderzoek der\nMaterie (FOM) in providing the required beam time on FELIX and highly appreciate the skilful\nassistance of the FELIX staff.
