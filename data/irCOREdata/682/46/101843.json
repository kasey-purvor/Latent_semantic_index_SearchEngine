INTRODUCTION \n \nElectrical isolation between devices in monolithic \nintegrated circuits is very crucial so as to minimize \ndevice\/device parasitic effects.  This can be achieved either \nby mesa, dielectric or implantation techniques [1].  Implant \nisolation is advantageous as the surface planarity is \nmaintained, higher throughput is obtained compared to mesa \netch and, in general, less intrusion under the mask edges is \nobserved [2].  Using the ion implantation technique, free \ncarriers are compensated by either irradiation-induced \ndamage or chemically-related deep levels [3].  The choice of \nthe ion species, mass, dose, energy and target temperature \ndepends on the thickness of the layer to be isolated and the \nrequired thermal stability of the isolation.             \nIn InP and other In-based compounds, isolation mainly \ncaused by a damage-induced compensation mechanism is not \nas effective in creating thermally stable high-resistivity \nregions [4,5,6].  In an effort to obtain higher sheet \nresistivities in n-type InP, we have investigated the \nimplantation of Fe, an impurity which is known to result in \nhigh-resistivity InP when used as a dopant during the growth \nof bulk crystals [7].  Transition elements such as Fe or Co are \nwell known to create deep traps for mobile carriers \nproducing thermally stable semi-insulating InP [8].  The \nintroduction of chemically activated deep electron traps in n-\ntype InP by Fe implantation could be a powerful method to \nproduce semi-insulating regions to be used as current-\nblocking layers in buried heterostructure lasers or \nheterojunction bipolar transistors. \nThe present work deals with the formation of good \nelectrical isolation in Si-doped InP layers using 1 MeV iron \nat different substrate temperatures.  An annealing window is \ndetermined for effective electrical isolation.  The effects \nexhibited by hot and cold implants are studied here in terms \nof the annealing characteristics of the sheet resistivity.  The \ndata for the evolution of sheet resistivity as a function of \nannealing temperature for iron-implanted InP layers \nmaintained at 77K, RT, 100 or 200oC is reported here for the \nfirst time. \n \nII. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE \n \nSemi-insulating Fe-doped InP wafers of (100) orientation \nwere used as substrates for the growth of n-type InP \nepilayers, with the (100) axis 20 off normal orientation, using \na Solid Source Molecular Beam Epitaxy reactor.  An \nundoped InP buffer layer of thickness 1\u00b5m was first grown \nbelow the n-type layer.  Silicon was used to dope the n-type \nlayers with a concentration and thickness of 1x1018\/cm3 and \n1\u00b5m respectively.  The wafers were cleaved to obtain several \nsamples of approximately 1 cm2 for the preparation of the \nresistors.  All samples were cleaned in organic solvents and \nthe clover-leaf pattern was printed on them using optical \nlithography.  A solution of hydrochloric acid (HCl) and \nphosphoric acid (H3PO4) in the ratio of 1:1 by volume was \nused to etch the exposed area of n-type InP samples to a   \n \n \n______________________________ \n*Fax : +44 1483534139, E-mail: p.too@eim.surrey.ac.uk \n    - 610 -   0-7803-7155-0\/02\/$10.00 \u00a9 2002 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

The total etch depth was \nmeasured using a Rank Taylor Hobson Talystep, the error \ntypically being 5%.  The photoresist was then removed in \nacetone leaving the cloverleaf Hall pattern on the samples. \nThe samples were divided into four different groups with \nimplant isolation at temperatures of 77K, 250C, 1000C, and \n2000C using a 2MV High Voltage Engineering Europa \n(HVEE) implanter.  The accuracy in the temperature control \nwas \u00b13oC.  During implantation, the sample was tilted about \n70 from the surface normal to minimize channeling.  For 77K \nimplants, the samples were mounted on a cold stage, which \nwas cooled using liquid nitrogen.  The center of the Hall \npattern for all the samples was irradiated with Fe+ using a \ndose and energy of 5x1014 cm-2 and 1MeV respectively, with \na beam current density < 0.33 \u00b5A\/cm2. \nThe post-implant annealing was performed in the range \n1000C - 8000C (\u00b15oC) for a time of 60s in a nitrogen \natmosphere, following a ramp up to a temperature of 60s.   \nSamples were set in the face-to-face configuration with a \nwhole two inch diameter virgin InP wafer covering the \nimplanted sample surfaces.  This provides a local \nphosphorous pressure to prevent dissociation of InP occurring \nnear the surface during high temperature annealing (>3000C).   \nOhmic contacts to the samples were fabricated by applying \nindium and sintering at approximately 2000C for 2min.   \nOhmic contacts were applied prior to isolation implants for \nthose samples which required annealing below 2000C. \nThe sheet resistivity, sheet carrier concentration and Hall \nmobility were measured using a Bio-Rad HL5500 Hall effect \nsystem employing Van der Pauw geometry at 300K under a \nmagnetic field strength of 0.32 T.  All measurements were \ndone at RT for samples implanted at 77K, 1000C and 2000C.      \n \nIII.

The projected range \nof iron ions is approximately 0.6\u00b5m with a projected straggle \nof 0.20\u00b5m, estimated by TRIM calculations.  The energy of \nthe iron beam was chosen to place most of the iron atoms \nwell inside the doped region.  In this way, the chemical \ncompensation will be more effective for the electrical \nisolation of the n-type InP epilayer.       \nFigure 2 shows the evolution of sheet resistivity as a \nfunction of post-implant annealing temperature for layers \nisolated with 1MeV iron at 77K, RT, 1000C and 2000C, \nrespectively.  The initial sheet resistivity of the n-type InP \nlayer for all the samples is ~15 \u2126\/\u06a4.  The initial mobility and \nsheet electron concentrations are ~1775 cm2\/V.s and 2.3x1014 \n\/cm2 respectively.  After iron implantation, an as-implanted \nsheet resistivity of ~5x106 \u2126\/\u06a4 is obtained for substrate \ntemperatures of 77K, RT, and 1000C and that of 2000C is \n7x105 \u2126\/\u06a4.

Most of the carriers are trapped at defect sites generated \nduring the implantation causes the large increase in the sheet \nresistivity and this, together with a degradation in the \nmobility. A maximum resistivity of ~1x107 \u2126\/\u06a4 was obtained \nfor 77K, RT and 1000C substrate temperatures after a post-\nimplant annealing cycle of 4000C for 60s. After a similar \nanneal, a resistivity of ~2x106 \u2126\/\u06a4 was measured for the \n2000C implant. Further increase in the post-annealing \ntemperature above 4000C produces a decrease in sheet \nresistivity by at least one order of magnitude.  However the \nsheet resistivity increases again at 6500C to 2.1x106, 1.2x106 \nand 2.5x105 \u2126\/\u06a4 for 77K, RT and 1000C implants \nrespectively.  This increase is not found for samples \nimplanted at 2000C.  We infer that the isolation produced in \nour case is a product of both damage related centres and \ndefects related to the presence of Fe at this annealing \ntemperature.         \nA high sheet resistivity (106 - 107 \u2126\/\u06a4) is maintained until \nan annealing temperature of 5000C for all four substrate \ntemperatures (see figure 2). This wide thermally stable \nannealing window is very useful from the technological point \nof view.  Above 6500C, there is a gradual decrease in sheet \nresistivity for all the substrate temperatures due to recovery of \nthe carriers as the defects are annealed out.  The out-diffusion \nof iron atoms towards the surface and deep into the bulk after \nannealing at 8000C is reported by Ridgway et al [10] using \nSecondary Ions Mass Spectroscopy which is in complete \nagreement with the interpretation of the decrease in the sheet \nresistivity above 6500C.  \nWe reported that for a high dose (5x1014 \/cm2), the first \nfew microns of an InP layer is amorphised for substrate \ntemperature below 2000C [11]. However less damage is \nproduced for 2000C implants due to enhanced dynamic \nannealing and this is most likely the reason why lower \ntemperature implants produce higher resistivities.  Most of the \ndefects created at such an elevated temperature are annealed \nout during the implantation.  Gasparotto et al [12] reported a \nsimilar phenomenon after Fe ion implantation in Sn doped \nInP at RT and 2000C using a dose and energy of 2x1014 \/cm2 \nand 2MeV respectively.  They used Rutherford backscattering \nspectroscopy (RBS) to show that less damage was created for \nhigh temperature implantation.  RBS was also used by Bahir \net al [13] to demonstrate that less damage was formed for \n2000C implants of Si into SI InP using a fluence of 3.3x1014 \n\/cm2 at 180keV.             \nWe infer that the increase in the sheet resistivity again at \nan annealing temperature of 6500C for samples implanted at \n77k, RT and 1000C is due to the chemical compensation \neffect of the iron atoms. This result agrees with that reported \nby Pearton et al [14]. He observed chemical compensation \nabove an annealing temperature of 5000C for multiple Fe \nenergies implantation into Sn-doped InP.  He reported that the \nchemical compensation effect was present only when the Fe \nconcentration was above that of the dopant, which is what we \nhave shown from TRIM simulation. For a dose of 5x1014 \n\/cm2, the Fe concentration is higher than the doping \nconcentration by one order of magnitude.  \n \nIV. CONCLUSION \n \nIn summary, we have assessed the behaviour of sheet \nresistivity and the thermal stability of the electrical isolation \nof n-type InP epilayers using iron implantation as a function \nof implant and annealing temperatures.  A maximum sheet \nresistivity of ~1x107 \u2126\/\u06a4 is achieved for samples implanted \nat 77K, RT and 1000C after annealing at 4000C. Implanting \nat 2000C produces lower resistivities, showing that there is \nno advantage in implanting at elevated temperatures. The \nsemi-insulating properties of these epilayers are stable up to \n5000C for all implantation temperatures.  The single implant \nisolation scheme is inherently simple, has a wide thermally \nstable window and is compatible with conventional \nprocessing steps.  These results demonstrate the potential \nusefulness of Fe implantation for device isolation \napplication. \n \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \n \nThe authors gratefully acknowledge financial support \nfrom the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research \nCouncil (EPSRC).
