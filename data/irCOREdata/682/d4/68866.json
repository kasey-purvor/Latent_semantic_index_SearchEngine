In particular, a self consistent Hartree approximation is used to describe imperfect screening\nof an external gate, employed primarily to control the density n of electrons on the bilayer, resulting\nin a potential difference between the layers and a density dependent gap \u2206(n). We discuss the\ninfluence of a finite asymmetry gap \u2206(0) at zero excess density, caused by the screening of an\nadditional transverse electric field, on observations of the quantum Hall effect.\nPACS numbers: 73.63.-b, 71.70.Di, 73.43.Cd, 81.05.Uw\nRecently there has been a huge amount of theoretical\ninterest in the low energy electronic properties of ultra-\nthin graphite films, including graphene monolayers [1, 2]\nand bilayers [3, 4]. This activity followed the successful\nfabrication of ultrathin graphite films [5] and subsequent\nmeasurements of an unusual sequencing of quantum Hall\neffect plateaus [6, 7]. While the Hamiltonian for low en-\nergy electrons in a monolayer describes Dirac-like chiral\nquasiparticles with Berry phase pi [1, 2], the low energy\nHamiltonian for a bilayer describes chiral quasiparticles\nwith a parabolic dispersion and Berry phase 2pi [3].\nTheoretical [3] and experimental [8] studies of bilayer\ngraphene have shown that asymmetry \u2206 = \u000f2 \u2212 \u000f1 be-\ntween on-site energies \u000f1, \u000f2 in the layers leads to a gap\nbetween the otherwise degenerate conduction and valence\nbands as shown schematically in Fig. 1(a). Moreover,\nin contrast to graphene monolayers, there is an exper-\nimental possibility of controlling the magnitude of the\ngap \u2206 in the spectrum of bilayer graphene through the\nuse of an external gate that is employed primarily to\ncontrol the density of electrons n on the bilayer system\n[5, 6, 7, 9]. Such a dependence \u2206(n) owes its existence\nto the Coulomb interaction between electrons, but the\ndensity distribution itself is dependent on the value of\n\u2206 via the band structure. Here we use a self-consistent\nHartree approximation to determine the electronic dis-\ntribution on a bilayer in the presence of an external gate.\nThe numerically calculated \u2206(n) is shown in Fig. 1(b)\n(solid line) for typical experimental parameters in the\ncase that the gap \u2206 = 0 at zero excess density [10]. It\nshows that the addition of density n \u223c 1012cm\u22122 yields a\ngap \u2206 \u223c 10meV. The numerical curve is compared with\nthe following analytic approximation (dashed line) valid\nfor \u2206\u001c \u03b31:\n\u2206 \u2248 e\n2L2n\n2Cb\n[\n1 +\n\u039b~2v2pi|n|\n\u03b321\n\u2212 \u039b ln\n(\n~v\n\u221a\npi|n|\n\u03b31\n)]\u22121\n, (1)\nwhere Cb is the capacitance of a bilayer of area L\n2,\nv is the in-plane velocity of the bilayer and \u03b31 is\nthe inter-plane coupling. The dimensionless parameter\n\u039b = e2L2\u03b31\/(2pi~\n2v2Cb) describes the effectiveness of the\nscreening of the bilayer.

(1). For these\nvalues of density \u2206\u02dc \u2248 \u2206 [10].\nwhereas for \u039b\u2192\u221e there is excellent screening, the den-\nsity lies solely on the layer closest to the external gate\nand \u2206 = 0. For typical experimental parameters [11] we\nestimate that \u039b \u223c 1.\nWe consider a graphene bilayer, with interlayer sepa-\nration c0, located a distance d from a gate. An external\ngate voltage Vg = end\/\u03b5\n\u2032\nr\u03b50 induces a total excess density\nn = n1 + n2 on the bilayer where n1 (n2) is the excess\ndensity on the layer closest to (furthest from) the gate.\nHere \u03b50 is the permittivity of free space, \u03b5\n\u2032\nr is the dielec-\ntric constant and e is the electronic charge. Imperfect\nscreening of the effective charge density en from the gate\nleads to an excess density n2 on the layer furthest from\nthe gate, with a corresponding change in potential energy\n\u2206U2 = e\n2n2c0\/\u03b5r\u03b50 that determines the layer asymmetry\n\u2206 (n) = \u000f2 \u2212 \u000f1 \u2261 \u22060 + e2n2L2\/Cb , (2)\nwhere Cb = \u03b5r\u03b50L\n2\/c0 and \u03b5r is the bilayer dielectric\nconstant. We introduce the bare asymmetry parame-\nter \u22060 due to an additional transverse electric field pro-\n2ducing finite asymmetry \u2206(0) at zero density. The fol-\nlowing analysis includes (a) the tight binding model of\nbilayer graphene including the asymmetry \u2206, (b) a self-\nconsistent determination of the gap numerically and, for\n\u000fF , \u03b31 \u001d \u2206, analytically, and (c) a description of the in-\nfluence of \u22060 on the cyclotron mass and the sequencing\nof quantum Hall effect plateaus at low density.\n(a) The bilayer is modelled as two coupled hexagonal\nlattices with inequivalent sites A1, B1 and A2, B2 in the\nfirst and second graphene sheets, respectively, arranged\naccording to Bernal (A2-B1) stacking. This lattice has\na degeneracy point at each of two inequivalent corners,\nK and K\u02dc, of the hexagonal Brillouin zone which deter-\nmine the centers of two valleys of a gapless spectrum.\nAt the degeneracy point, electron states on inequivalent\n(A1\/B1 or A2\/B2) sublattices in a single layer are de-\ncoupled, whereas interlayer coupling \u03b3A2B1 \u2261 \u03b31 forms\ndimers from pairs of A2-B1 orbitals in a bilayer, thus\nleading to the formation of high energy bands [3, 12].\nThe tight-binding Hamiltonian operates in the space of\nwave functions \u03a8 = (\u03c8A1, \u03c8B2, \u03c8A2, \u03c8B1) in the valley K\nand of \u03a8 = (\u03c8B2, \u03c8A1, \u03c8B1, \u03c8A2) in the valley K\u02dc [3]:\nH = \u03be\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n\u2212 12\u2206 0 0 vpi\u2020\n0 12\u2206 vpi 0\n0 vpi\u2020 12\u2206 \u03be\u03b31\nvpi 0 \u03be\u03b31 \u2212 12\u2206\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 , (3)\nwhere pi = px+ ipy and \u03be = +1(\u22121) labels valley K (K\u02dc).\nThe Hamiltonian takes into account asymmetry \u2206 = \u000f2\u2212\n\u000f1 between on-site energies in the two layers, \u000f2 =\n1\n2\u2206,\n\u000f1 = \u2212 12\u2206. Within each plane, nearest neighbor coupling\nas parameterised by \u03b30 leads to in-plane velocity v =(\u221a\n3\/2\n)\na\u03b30\/~ where a is the lattice constant.\nAt zero magnetic field, the Hamiltonian H describes\nfour valley-degenerate bands, \u000f\n(\u03b1)\n\u00b1 (p), \u03b1 = 1, 2, with\n\u000f(\u03b1)2 =\n\u03b321\n2\n+\n\u22062\n4\n+ v2p2 + (\u22121)\u03b1\n\u221a\n\u03b341\n4\n+ v2p2 (\u03b321 +\u2206\n2),\nwhere p is the magnitude of the momentum near the K\npoint, Fig. 1(a). The energies of the bands exactly at\nthe K point are |\u000f(2)\u00b1 (0)| =\n\u221a\n\u03b321 +\u2206\n2\/4 and |\u000f(1)\u00b1 (0)| =\n|\u2206|\/2. Thus \u000f(2)\u00b1 describes higher-energy (A2-B1 dimer)\nbands |\u000f(2)\u00b1 | \u2265 \u03b31 whereas \u000f(1)\u00b1 are low energy bands split\nby the layer asymmetry \u2206 at the K point [10].\nThe electronic densities n1 and n2 on the in-\ndividual layers are given by an integral with re-\nspect to momentum over the circular Fermi sur-\nface n1(2) = (2\/pi~\n2)\n\u222b\np dp\n(|\u03c8A1(2)(p)|2 + |\u03c8B1(2)(p)|2)\nwhere we have included a factor of four to take into ac-\ncount spin and valley degeneracy. On determining the\nwavefunction amplitudes on the four atomic sites we find\nn1(2) =\n\u222b\ndp p g\u2213(\u000f, p) , (4)\ng\u2213(\u000f, p) =\n\u000f\u2213\u2206\/2\npi~2\u000f\n[(\n\u000f2 \u2212\u22062\/4)2 \u2213 2v2p2\u000f\u2206\u2212 v4p4\n(\u000f2 \u2212\u22062\/4)2 + v2p2\u22062 \u2212 v4p4\n]\n,\nwhere the minus (plus) sign is for the first (second) layer.\nThe limits of integration are allowed values of momentum\nthat, depending on the band in question and the value\nof the Fermi energy \u000fF , are p = 0 or p\u00b1 where v\n2p2\u00b1 =\n\u000f2F +\n1\n4\u2206\n2 \u00b1 [\u000f2F (\u03b321 +\u22062)\u2212 14\u03b321\u22062]1\/2.\n(b) The self-consistent calculation begins with zero ex-\nternal gate voltage, assuming the Fermi energy to be\nlocated at \u000f = 0. We take into account the contribu-\ntion of the two valence bands to the initial densities on\neach layer, n\n(0)\n1 = \u2212n(0)2 , and evaluate the gap \u2206(0) us-\ning Eqs. (2,4). Then, we proceed to the case where an\nexternal gate voltage produces excess densities n1, n2,\nn = n1 + n2 6= 0, and a gap \u2206(n). Figure 2(a) shows\n\u2206(n) for different values of the bare asymmetry \u22060 [10]\nand Fig. 2(b) shows the variation of the individual layer\ndensities n1 and n2 for finite \u22060. The main effect of finite\n\u22060 (dashed and dotted lines in Fig. 2(a)) is to shift the\nplot \u2206(n) with respect to the \u22060 = 0 case (solid line),\nbut, as a result of screening, the asymmetry at zero den-\nsity \u2206(0) is smaller than the bare asymmetry \u22060. For ex-\nample, the dotted curve for \u22060 = 0.2\u03b31 = 78meV shows\n\u2206(0) \u2248 21meV. Figure 2(c) shows the variation of \u2206(0)\nwith bare asymmetry \u22060 (solid line).\nWe find an analytic expression for \u2206(n) in the limit\n\u03b31, \u000fF \u001d |\u2206| by evaluating the density on each layer\nEq. (4) using an expansion in \u2206\/\u03b31. For simplicity, we\nconsider |\u2206|\/2 < |\u000fF | < \u03b31 so that either the band just\nabove or just below zero energy is partially occupied. On\nintegrating Eq. (4) from zero momentum to pF = p+, we\nfind the densities in the partially occupied bands. We also\ntake into account the redistribution of density within the\nvalence bands for \u000fF 6= 0 as compared to the \u000fF = 0 case,\nas given by \u00b1\u03b31\u2206\/\n(\n4pi~2v2\n)\nln (4\u03b31\/|\u2206|), so that\nn1(2) \u2248\nsgn (\u000fF ) p\n2\nF\n2pi~2\n\u00b1 \u03b31\u2206\n2pi~2v2\n[\n\u000f0\n\u03b31\n+\n\u000f20\n\u03b321\n\u2212 12 ln\n(\n\u000f0\n\u03b31\n)]\n,\nwhere \u000f0 = (\u03b31\/2)[\n\u221a\n1 + 4v2p2F \/\u03b3\n2\n1\u22121] and n = n1+n2 \u2248\nsgn (\u000fF ) p\n2\nF \/\n(\npi~2\n)\n.

(2) to find the gap,\n\u2206 \u2248 \u22060 + e\n2L2n\/(2Cb)\n1 + \u039b\n[\n(\u000f0\/\u03b31) + (\u000f0\/\u03b31)2 \u2212 12 ln (\u000f0\/\u03b31)\n] . (5)\nThis is valid for intermediate densities |\u2206|, |\u22060| \u001c |\u000fF | <\n\u03b31 where \u000fF \u2248 \u00b1\u000f0 [at very low density it incorrectly pre-\ndicts \u2206(0) = 0 for \u22060 6= 0]. In the regime 4pi~2v2|n| \u001c\n\u03b321 and \u22060 = 0 it gives Eq. (1).\nThere is uncertainty in the value of the capacitance\nCb within this model because we assume that the ex-\ncess charge is uniformly distributed within infinitesimally\nthin 2d layers. Also, we used \u03b5r = 1 for the dielec-\ntric constant of the bilayer which agrees with the pre-\ndiction for other low dimensional structures [13], but is\nsmaller than the value for bulk graphite \u03b5r \u2248 2.4 [14].\nFurthermore, we assume that the model parameters, in-\ncluding layer separation and interlayer coupling \u03b31, do\n3(a)\n(d)\n0\n0.05\n0.1\n0.15\n20 40 60 80 100\nn (1011 cm-2)\n-100 -80 -60 -40 -20\nm\nc\/\nm\ne\n\u2206(\nn\n) \n(m\neV\n)\n-150\n-100\n-50\n50\n100\n150\n20 40 60 80 100\nn (1011 cm-2)\n-100 -80 -60 -40 -20\n(c)\n(b)\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n20 40 60 80 100\n\u22060 (meV)\n\u2206(\n0\n) \n(m\ne\nV\n)\n-80\n-60\n-40\n-20\n20\n40\n60\n80\n20 40 60 80 100\nn (1011 cm-2)\n-100 -80 -60 -40 -20\nn\n1\n,n\n2\n (\n1\n0\n1\n1\n c\nm\n-2\n)\nn1\nn2\n\u03b5r=1\n\u03b5r=2\nFIG. 2: Numerical evaluation of (a) the bilayer asymmetry\n\u2206(n) for different values of the bare asymmetry \u22060 = 0 (solid\nline), \u22060 = 0.1\u03b31 = 39meV (dashed line) and \u22060 = 0.2\u03b31 =\n78meV (dotted line), using typical parameter values [11], (b)\nlayer densities n2 (solid) and n1 (dashed) as a function of n\nfor \u22060 = 0.2\u03b31 = 78meV, (c) \u2206(0) as a function of \u22060 for\n\u03b5r = 1 (solid line) and \u03b5r = 2 (dashed), and (d) the cyclotron\nmass mc in units of the bare electronic mass me, for different\nvalues of \u22060 as in (a).\nnot vary as a function of applied potential whereas a re-\ncent experiment [8] found that \u03b31 changed by about 3%\nas \u2206 changed by 100meV.

For a circular Fermi surface, the semiclassical\nexpression for cyclotron mass mc = p\/(\u2202\u000f\/\u2202p) gives\nmc =\n\u000f(\u03b1)\nv2\n[\n1 + (\u22121)\u03b1 \u03b3\n2\n1 +\u2206\n2\n2\n\u221a\nv2p2 [\u03b321 +\u2206\n2] + \u03b341\/4\n]\u22121\n.\nIn the limit \u2206 = 0 for the low energy bands \u03b1 = 1 this\ngives mc = (\u03b31\/2v\n2)\n\u221a\n1 + 4pi~2v2|n|\/\u03b321 [3]. Figure 2(d)\nshows the cyclotron massmc as a function of total density\nn. For \u22060 = 0 (solid line) the mass is symmetric and\nfinite mc = \u03b31\/2v\n2 at zero density. The other curves, for\n\u22060 > 0, show that the cyclotron mass for positive and\nnegative densities is asymmetric with divergent behavior\nat low density resulting from the \u201cmexican hat\u201d structure\nof the low energy bands [12].\nAnother manifestation of finite \u22060 is in the sequencing\nof quantum Hall effect (QHE) plateaus at low density.\nThe Landau level (LL) spectrum of bilayer graphene has\nbeen discussed in Ref.

For com-\npleteness we include the final two terms, with dimension-\nless parameters |\u03b1|, |\u03b2| \u001c 1, describing weak asymmetry\nbetween the conduction and valence bands. Neglected in\nRef. [3], they arise due to additional couplings such as\nnext-to-nearest neighbor in-plane coupling between A1-\nA1 and B2-B2 orbitals or interlayer coupling between\nA1-A2 and B1-B2 orbitals. The Landau level (LL) spec-\ntrum may be found using the Landau gauge A = (0, Bx),\nin which operators pi\u2020 and pi coincide with raising and\nlowering operators [15] in the basis of Landau functions\neiky\u03c6N (x), such that pi\n\u2020\u03c6N = i(~\/\u03bbB)\n\u221a\n2(N + 1)\u03c6N+1,\npi \u03c6N = \u2212i(~\/\u03bbB)\n\u221a\n2N\u03c6N\u22121, and pi \u03c60 = 0, where \u03bbB =\u221a\n~\/(eB). The spectrum has almost equidistant energy\nlevels for N \u2265 2 with spacing ~\u03c9c, \u03c9c = eB\/m, which\nare weakly split in valleys K and K\u02dc (\u03be = \u00b11) [3],\n\u000f\u00b1N\u22652 \u2248\n\u03be\u2206~\u03c9c\n2\u03b31\n\u2212 \u03b1~\u03c9c(N \u2212 12 )\u00b1 ~\u03c9c\n\u221a\nN(N \u2212 1), (6)\nwhere \u000f+N and \u000f\n\u2212\nN are assigned to electron and hole states,\nrespectively, and we assume |\u2206|\/\u03b31 \u001c 1, |\u2206|\/~\u03c9c . 1.\nThe LL spectrum in each valley also contains two levels\nidentified using the fact that pi2\u03c61 = pi\n2\u03c60 = 0,{\n\u000f0 = \u2212 12\u03be\u2206\u2212 12 (\u03b1\u2212 \u03b2)~\u03c9c ; \u03a60\u03be \u2261 (\u03c60, 0);\n\u000f1 = \u2212 12\u03be\u2206+ \u03be\u2206~\u03c9c\u03b31 \u2212 12 (3\u03b1\u2212 \u03b2)~\u03c9c ; \u03a61\u03be \u2261 (\u03c61, 0).\nAccording to different definitions of two-component \u03a6 in\ntwo valleys, N = 0, 1 LL states in the valleyK are formed\nby orbitals predominantly on the A sites from the bottom\nlayer, whereas the corresponding states in the valley K\u02dc\nare located on B\u02dc sites from the top layer, as reflected by\nthe splitting \u2206 between the lowest LL in the two valleys.\nThe spectrum is shown on the right side of Fig. 3 assum-\ning |\u2206|\/\u03b31 \u001c 1, |\u2206|\/~\u03c9c . 1. In a symmetric bilayer\n(\u2206 = 0) levels \u000f0 and \u000f1 are degenerate and have the\nsame energy in valleys K and K\u02dc, thus forming an 8-fold\ndegenerate LL at \u000f = 0 (here, spin is taken into account)\nas shown on the left side of Fig. 3.\nThe LL spectrum is reflected in the QHE Hall conduc-\ntivity dependence on carrier density, \u03c3xy(n), although,\n42\n6\n12\n-  12\n-  6\n-  2\n(4,+);(4,-)\n(3,+);(3,-)\n(2,+);(2,-)\n(0,+);(1,+)\n(0,-);(1,-)\n(2,+);(2,-)\n(3,+);(3,-)\n(4,+);(4,-)\n\u03b5\/h\u03c9c\n\u03b5=0\nbilayer \u2206 = 0\n2\n6\n12\n-  12\n-  6\n-  2\n(4,+);(4,-)\n(3,+);(3,-)\n(2,+);(2,-)\n(0,+);(1,+)\n(0,-);(1,-)\n(2,+);(2,-)\n(3,+);(3,-)\n(4,+);(4,-)\n\u03b5\/h\u03c9c\nbilayer \u2206 = 0\nh\u03c9c\n\u2206\n\u03c3xy (-4e\n2\/h)\n-2\n-3\n1\n2\n3\n-1\nhn\neB4 8 12-4-8-12\nFIG. 3: Landau levels for zero (left) and finite asymmetry\n\u2206 (right). Brackets (N, \u03be) indicate LL number N and valley\nindex \u03be = \u00b11. In the center the predicted Hall conductivity\n\u03c3xy as a function of carrier density for bare asymmetry \u22060 = 0\n(dashed line) is compared to that for \u22060 6= 0 (solid line).\nin general, finite temperature and LL broadening tend to\nmask small LL splitting. When the asymmetry at zero\ndensity \u2206(0), Fig. 2(c), is large enough that the percolat-\ning states [15] from the lowest levels in the two valleys can\nbe resolved (the right side of Fig. 3), then these levels,\nembedded into the ladder of 4-fold degenerate LL\u2019s with\nn \u2265 2, Eq. (6), result in the form of \u03c3xy(n) as sketched\nin the center of Fig. 3 (solid line) which exhibits plateaus\nat all integer values of 4e2\/h including a plateau at zero\ndensity. The temperature dependence of the zero density\nplateau will differ from that of the other plateaus because\nof the different activation energies, related to \u2206(0) and\n~\u03c9c, respectively. When it is not possible to resolve the\nasymmetry splitting of the group of 8 states at |\u000f| = 0 (for\n\u2206(0) \u2248 \u22060 \u2248 0) then \u03c3xy(n) (dashed line in Fig. 3) has\nplateaus at integer values of 4e2\/h and a double 8e2\/h\nstep across n = 0 [3, 7].\nThe use of doping [8] recently achieved gaps of up to\nabout 200meV. Alternatively, a potential difference of\n30V applied to a back gate placed 300nm from the bilayer\n(combined with \u22123V applied to a top gate 30nm away)\ntranslates into 30mV across the bilayer, \u22060 = 30meV,\nand \u2206(0) \u2248 7meV. This compares with ~\u03c9c \u2248 22meV for\nfield B = 10T [11] and level broadening due to scattering\nof approximately 3meV in recent experiments [9].\nThis paper has considered the influence of a single gate\nplaced above an ultra thin graphite film as employed in\nrecent experiments [5, 6, 7, 9] to control the density of\nelectrons n on the film. For the typical experimental\nrange of densities shown in Fig. 1(b) the dependence of\nthe asymmetry gap \u2206(n) is roughly linear with n with\nthe addition of density n \u223c 1012cm\u22122 yielding a gap\n\u2206 \u223c 10meV. Finite bilayer asymmetry gap \u2206(0) at zero\nexcess density, due to an additional transverse electric\nfield, could influence observations of the integer quan-\ntum Hall effect by introducing a plateau at zero density\nin the Hall conductivity. This plateau is accompanied\nby a dip in the diagonal conductivity, the temperature\ndependence of which can be used to extract the value of\nthe asymmetry gap \u2206(0). This is distinguishable from\nthe behavior of the higher plateaus with activation ener-\ngies determined by the cyclotron frequency.\nAcknowledgments\nThe author thanks V. I. Fal\u2019ko, A. K.
