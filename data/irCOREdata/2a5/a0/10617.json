In the mean-field, Gross-Pitaevskii equa-\ntion (GPE) description, BSWs in a quasi-one-dimensional\n(quasi-1D) BEC with no external (axial) trapping potential\ncorrespond exactly to bright solitons in the focusing nonlinear\nSchro\u00a8dinger equation (NLSE):\ni\n\u2202\u03c8(x,t)\n\u2202t\n=\n[\n\u22121\n2\n\u22022\n\u2202x2\n\u2212 |\u03c8(x,t)|2\n]\n\u03c8(x,t). (1)\nThis integrable equation describes a diverse range of\nphysical systems in addition to BECs [4], and its bright\nsoliton solutions have been extensively studied in the context\nof nonlinear optics [5\u20139]. The addition of a harmonic trapping\npotential to Eq. (1) leads to nonintegrability, but BSWs in\nharmonically trapped, quasi-1D BECs remain, in the GPE\ndescription, highly solitonlike; they collide elastically over\na large parameter regime, and their asymptotic trajectories\nfollow particle models applicable to solitons [10,11]. Relaxing\nthe quasi-1D restriction reduces the soliton character of\nBSWs further, but BSWs in the 3D GPE description retain\nmany solitonlike characteristics [12], including an absence\nof dispersion and the existence of a well-defined relative\nphase between BSWs. If actual 3D BSWs possess a well-\ndefined relative phase when realized experimentally, one can\nenvisage a BSW interferometer, akin to current matter-wave\ninterferometers but leveraging the small size, coherence, and\nnondispersive nature of BSWs [2]. Indeed, BSWs have already\nbeen proposed as a metrological tool for the study of atom-\nsurface interactions [13].\nExperiments to date have produced both individual [1] and\nmultiple [2,3] BSWs as remnants from the collapse [14,15] of\na larger condensate. These BSWs were capable, in the case of\nmultiple BSWs, of surviving many mutual recollisions at the\ntrap center [2,3]. In the quasi-1D regime the observed BSW\nmotion matches the GPE description of BSWs with relative\nphase \u0003 = \u03c0 [2,16]. In the 3D regime, however, BSWs are\nnot universally stable against multiple recollisions; numerical\n*t.p.billam@durham.ac.uk\nintegration of the GPE reveals that slow 3D BSWs retain their\nform for fewer collisions when their relative phase, \u0003, is equal\nto 0 than when \u0003 = \u03c0 [12]. The long lifetimes of 3D BSWs\nseen in experiment thus seem to imply that their relative phase\n\u0003 = \u03c0 [3,12]. Modulational instability and the shorter lifetime\nof colliding 3D BSWs when \u0003 = 0 have been identified as\ncontributory causes to these apparent antiphase relations in\nboth regimes [12,16,17]. However, recent simulations of BSW\ncollisions incorporating quantum noise have been interpreted\nas showing the dynamics and collisional stability of BSWs\nto be phase-independent, with the dynamics for all relative\nphases corresponding to the GPE description for \u0003 = \u03c0 [18].\nFurthermore, no 3D GPE simulation of the collapse process\nhas produced BSW remnants matching those observed in\nexperiment [18]. These considerations leave the following\nquestion open: Are experimentally observed atomic BSWs\nwell described by an effective single-particle wave function,\npropagated by the GPE?\nIn this Rapid Communication we propose an experiment\nto answer this question. We describe a method which, in\na velocity- and phase-controlled way, splits a single BSW\nin an axisymmetric harmonic trap into two outgoing BSWs,\nwhich repeatedly recollide at the trap center. Using the GPE,\nwe demonstrate that such pairs of BSWs can be realized in\nan atomic BEC, and analyze their dynamics and collisional\nstability. We explore the crossover from quasi-1D to fully\n3D regimes, examining the effects of velocity and relative\nphase on the number of collisions for which the BSWs remain\nsolitonlike, C1D. In addition to demonstrating the expected\nC1D phase dependence for slow collisions, we show that C1D\nhas a strong oscillatory dependence on the trap anisotropy,\ndue to resonances between the frequency of the BSWs\u2019\nradial oscillations and the frequency with which the two\nBSWs collide. The experimental presence (absence) of the\npredicted phase and anisotropy dependencies would indicate\nthe (in)sufficiency of the GPE description of BSWs; either of\nthese outcomes would be an important result. In particular,\nsufficiency of the GPE description implies a well-defined\nrelative phase between BSWs, paving the way for future\natom interferometry experiments using BSWs, toward which\nour proposed BSW generation method would represent an\nimportant step.\n041602-11050-2947\/2011\/83(4)\/041602(4) \u00a92011 American Physical Society\nRAPID COMMUNICATIONS\nT. P. BILLAM, S. L. CORNISH, AND S. A. GARDINER PHYSICAL REVIEW A 83, 041602(R) (2011)\nWe begin with the GPE for a BEC of N atoms of mass m\nand (attractive) s-wave scattering length as < 0, held within a\ncylindrically symmetric, prolate harmonic trap,\nih\u00af\n\u2202\u0005(r,t)\n\u2202t\n=\n[\n\u2212 h\u00af\n2\n2m\n\u22072 + V (r) \u2212 |g3D||\u0005(r,t)|2\n]\n\u0005(r,t),\n(2)\nwhere g3D = 4\u03c0Nash\u00af2\/m, the condensate wave function\n\u0005(r,t) is normalized to one, and V (r) = m[\u03c92xx2 + \u03c92r (y2 +\nz2)]\/2, where \u03c9x and \u03c9r > \u03c9x are the axial and radial trap fre-\nquencies. With strong radial confinement the system is quasi-\n1D and can be described by Eq. (2) with \u0005(r,t) \u2192 \u0005(x,t),\nV (r) \u2192 m\u03c92xx2\/2, and g3D \u2192 g1D = 2h\u00af\u03c9r |as |N [19]. The\nresulting configuration has two key length scales; the harmonic\nlength a0 =\n\u221a\nh\u00af\/m\u03c9x and the soliton length b0 = h\u00af2\/mg1D.\nRescaling all lengths to units of b0 and all times to units of\nh\u00af3\/mg21D [10] produces the dimensionless 1D GPE\ni\n\u2202\u03c8(x,t)\n\u2202t\n=\n[\n\u22121\n2\n\u22022\n\u2202x2\n+ \u03c9\n2x2\n2\n\u2212 |\u03c8(x,t)|2\n]\n\u03c8(x,t), (3)\nwhere \u03c9 = (b0\/a0)2 is a dimensionless effective trap\nstrength [20]. In this Rapid Communication, we consider the\neffects of abruptly increasing the scattering length magnitude\nin such a BEC from initial value a0s to as = \u03b12a0s (\u03b1 > 1 and\nas,a\n0\ns < 0), with initial condition\n\u03c8(x,t = 0) = \u03c80(x) = \u03c8\u03b1(x) cos\n(\nkx\n2\u03b12\n+ \u0003\n2\n)\n, (4)\nwhere \u03c8\u03b1(x) is the BSW ground state of the BEC for scattering\nlength a0s . We first consider the quasi-1D limit, where a stable\nground state \u03c8\u03b1(x) always exists, and then 3D, where the stable\nground state \u03c8\u03b1(r) exists only for |a0s | below the critical value\nfor the onset of collapse, |acs | [15].\nThe ground state \u03c8\u03b1(x) may be made by using a magnetic\nFeshbach resonance to adiabatically change the scattering\nlength from being initially repulsive to a negative value, a0s ,\nwith |a0s | < |acs |. The rapid change from a0s to as = \u03b12a0s could\nthen exploit the same resonance. The density modulation that\ntransforms \u03c8\u03b1(x) into \u03c80(x) may be achieved with a second\ninternal atomic state in an interference protocol: Writing the\ntotal state of the condensed atoms as \u03c8+(x)|+\u3009 + \u03c8\u2212(x)|\u2212\u3009,\nwe begin with all atoms in internal state |+\u3009 [i.e., \u03c8+(x) =\n\u03c8\u03b1(x) and \u03c8\u2212(x) = 0]. Applying a resonant \u03c0\/2 pulse to the\ninternal state transition yields \u03c8+(x) = \u03c8\u2212(x) = \u03c8\u03b1(x)\/\n\u221a\n2.\nWe now imprint equal and opposite momenta on the two in-\nternal states, giving \u03c8\u00b1(x) = exp[\u00b1i(Kx + \u0003)\/2]\u03c8\u03b1(x)\/\n\u221a\n2,\nwhich is then transformed into\n\u03c8+(x) = cos [(Kx + \u0003)\/2] \u03c8\u03b1(x), (5)\n\u03c8\u2212(x) = i sin [(Kx + \u0003)\/2] \u03c8\u03b1(x),\nby a second \u03c0\/2 pulse. Using resonant light to rapidly expel\natoms in state |\u2212\u3009 from the trap leaves those in state |+\u3009\nwith wave function \u03c80(x) [Eq. (4)], with k = \u03b12K , and with\n\u0003 determined by the phase accumulated at the center of the\nBSW. Note that the loss of atoms between \u03c8\u03b1(x) and \u03c80(x) is\nbalanced by the change in normalization; N denotes the initial\natom number. There are many potential implementations of\nthis protocol. Using a two-component GPE, we have simulated\nan implementation that uses 85Rb atoms in the quasi-1D regime\nwith an applied magnetic field gradient to transfer momentum:\nWe find this simple prototype to be capable of generating\ninitial conditions close to Eq. (4) using current experimental\ntechnology [21].\nNeglecting the axial trapping (setting \u03c9 = 0) the 1D GPE\n[Eq. (3)] reduces to the NLSE [Eq. (1)], and the ground state\nof the BEC before the change in scattering length, \u03c8\u03b1(x), is a\nsingle, stationary bright soliton [23]. After density modulation,\n\u03c80(x) = 12\u03b1 sech\n(\nx\n2\u03b12\n)\ncos\n(\nkx\n2\u03b12\n+ \u0003\n2\n)\n. (6)\nSolutions of the NLSE for this initial condition [Eq. (6)] are\nwell known in the context of nonlinear optics [7\u20139]. The case\nk = 0 has been studied analytically by Satsuma and Yajima [7]\nusing the inverse scattering transform (IST) [5]: For integer\n\u03b1 = J , Eq. (6) consists of a bound state, or multisoliton pulse,\nof J solitons with unequal amplitudes Aj and zero velocity\n(Vj = 0). For noninteger \u03b1 = J + \u03b2, Eq. (6) consists of J\nsolitons plus radiation, with the norm of the soliton component\ngiven by\n\u2211\nj 2Aj [7,23]. The modulated case (general k) has\nbeen considered both analytically and numerically by Kodama\nand Hasegawa [8] and Afanasjev and Vysloukh [9]. Figure 1\nshows how the modulation alters the character of a two-soliton\npulse (\u03b1 >\u223c 2): Beyond a certain threshold value of k the pulse\n\u201csplits\u201d into two solitons with equal amplitudes, opposite\nvelocities, and relative phase \u0003, plus a negligible radiation\ncomponent. Crucially, control of the modulation corresponds\nto control over the relative velocity and phase of a pair of\ngenerated bright solitons.\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1\n0 1 2\nS\nol\nit\non\nfr\nac\nti\non\nSpatial modulation frequency, k\n(c)\n0 1 2 3\n(f)\n-0.4\n-0.2\n0\n0.2\nV\nj\n(b)                                              (e)\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\nA\nj\n(a)                                              (d)\nFIG. 1.

Particle model [10] BSW trajectories, for effective masses\nand velocities obtained from the numerical scattering transform of\n\u03c80(x), are overlaid as lines in (c)\u2013(f). Panels (e) and (f) reproduce (c)\nand (d) for the case \u0003 = \u03c0 to show the difference in collision profile.\nThe density (color) axes are normalized by c = 0.35 (inset c = 0.25)\nin (a) and c = 0.12 (inset c = 0.07) in (b)\u2013(f).\nA similar correspondence exists in the presence of axial\ntrapping (\u03c9 > 0). In this regime the 1D GPE [Eq. (3)] has\nno soliton solutions, so we study the dynamics of initial\ncondition \u03c80(x) numerically, concentrating, for simplicity, on\nthe case \u03b1 = 2 (other cases \u03b1 >\u223c 2 are similar except for a\nslightly altered relationship between k and the resulting soliton\nspeed). A pair of equal amplitude BSWs are generated with\nrelative phase \u0003 and velocities controlled by k (Fig. 2). The\naxial trap confines the outgoing BSWs and causes subsequent\nrecollisions at the trap center, and the relative phase upon\nrecollision is always identical to the original imposed relative\nphase [10]. The BSWs remain highly solitonlike: The density\nprofile during BSW collisions is similar to that for bright\nsolitons [6] [Figs. 2(d) and 2(f)], the BSW trajectories are well\ndescribed by a particle model [10,11] [Figs. 2(c)\u20132(f)], and the\nBSWs are stable against their mutual collisions, insofar as they\nretain their form for a sufficiently large number of collisions\nthat atom losses, unaccounted for in the GPE, would be the\nlifetime-limiting factor in an experiment.\nMoving beyond the quasi-1D regime, we can generate pairs\nof 3D BSWs with controlled velocity and relative phase using\nthe same method.

Parameterizing the quasi-1D-to-3D transition by the trap\nanisotropy \u03bb = \u03c9r\/\u03c9x , we write the 3D GPE as\ni\n\u2202\u03c8(r,t)\n\u2202t\n=\n[\n\u2212\u2207\n2\n2\n+ V (r) \u2212 2\u03c0\n\u03bb\u03c9\n|\u03c8(r,t)|2\n]\n\u03c8(r,t), (7)\nwhere we use soliton variables [25], and V (r) = \u03c92[x2 +\n\u03bb2(y2 + z2)]\/2. We again study the dynamics of the BSWs nu-\nmerically, quantifying their stability against collisions in terms\nof their positions and maximum integrated axial densities at\nthe point of maximum separation \u2014 this being much easier\nto measure, on typical experimental scales, than the exact\ndensity profile during the collision. Figure 3(a) shows how\nthe number of 1D-like collisions C1D (taken to be those where\nthe positions and maximum integrated densities of the BSWs\nsubsequently return to within 75% of their original values)\ndepends on velocity, relative phase, and trap anisotropy. We\nterm these collisions 1D-like because all collisions of quasi-1D\nBSWs satisfy these criteria (C1D \u2192 \u221e).\nAs expected, Fig. 3(a) shows that C1D is strongly dependent\non the relative phase at low velocity, with the BSWs being most\n041602-3\nRAPID COMMUNICATIONS\nT.

At\nhigher velocity this phase-dependence weakens and the quasi-\n1D regime is reached at lower anisotropy. Figure 3(a) also\nreveals a previously unobserved feature: C1D shows a strong,\noscillatory dependence on the anisotropy at all velocities. This\ndependence arises from the BSWs being broken up by the\ntransfer of energy to radial oscillations [Figs. 3(b)\u20133(d)]. These\noscillations are started by the abrupt change in scattering length\nand subsequently amplified by collisions if the BSWs collide\nwhen their radial width is close to its oscillatory maximum.\nThe frequency of the radial oscillations is primarily determined\nby \u03c9r ; this leads to the observed oscillations of C1D as a\nfunction of \u03bb. The amplifying effect of collisions decreases\nwith the BSW velocity, and at low velocity a phase-dependent\namplification of the radial oscillations emerges [Figs. 3(e)\u2013\n3(g)], which we attribute to the higher densities at the point\nof collision when \u0003 = 0 delivering a larger \u201ckick\u201d than when\n\u0003 = \u03c0 . However, for intermediate phases symmetry-breaking\npopulation transfer [12,27] during collisions also contributes\nto the reduction in C1D [Fig. 3(f)]. Within the GPE description,\nFig. 3 represents a comprehensive prediction of the BSW\ndynamics resulting from our splitting protocol. Experimental\nobservation of the dynamics we predict would support the\nvalidity of the GPE description of BSWs and, in the case of\nthe oscillatory dependence of C1D on \u03bb, open the possibility\nof controlling the BSW lifetime directly.\nTo conclude, we have proposed an experiment that produces\na pair of BSWs with controlled relative phase and velocity in a\nharmonically trapped atomic BEC, and we have analyzed the\nsubsequent collisions of these BSWs using the GPE. In the\nquasi-1D regime the BSWs are highly solitonlike and stable\nagainst their recollisions. In the fully 3D regime, we confirm\nthat the collisional stability of the BSWs depends on their\nrelative phase and velocity and demonstrate a strong oscillatory\ndependence on the trap anisotropy. The presence, or absence,\nof these effects in experiments provides a direct test of whether\nexperimentally observed atomic BSWs can be described in\nterms of a coherent effective single-particle wave function,\npropagated by the GPE.\nWe thank N.
