The paper catalogues the commuting pairs \u0393 and L, including important\ncases in random matrix theory. There are also results proving rapid decay of the singular\nnumbers of Hankel integral operators with kernels that are analytic and of exponential\ndecay in the right half-plane.\nKeywords: random matrices, Tracy\u2013Widom operators\nMSC2000 Classification 47B35\n1. Introduction\nFor \u03c6 \u2208 L2(0,\u221e), we recall that the Hankel operator \u0393\u03c6 with kernel \u03c6(x + y) is the\nintegral operator\n\u0393\u03c6f(s) =\n\u222b \u221e\n0\n\u03c6(s + t)f(t) dt (1.1)\nfrom a subspace of L2(0,\u221e) into L2(0,\u221e).\nMegretski\u02d8\u0131, Peller and Treil [6] determined the possible spectral multiplicity function\nthat a continuous and self-adjoint Hankel operator can have; however, their spectral theory\ndoes not yield much information about the eigenvectors. Tracy and Widom observed that\nsome self-adjoint and compact Hankel operators commute with self-adjoint second-order\ndifferential operators L that have purely discrete spectrum, and hence \u0393\u03c6 and L have\na common orthonormal basis of eigenfunctions; see [9, 10]. One can then use the WKB\napproximation to describe the asymptotic eigenvalue distribution of L, and the asymptotic\nbehaviour of the eigenfunctions.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nThis work was partially supported by EU Network Grant MRTN-CT-2004-511953 \u2018Phenomena in High\nDimensions\u2019.\n1\nIn this paper we start with L and seek choices of \u03c6, thus reversing the order of steps\nin [9, 10]. Suppose that\nLf = \u2212 d\ndx\n(\na(x)\ndf\ndx\n)\n+ b(x)f(x), (1.2)\nwhere a and b are three times differentiable functions such that a(0) = 0. Suppose that\na\u2032\u2032\u2032 = Aa\u2032 and b\u2032\u2032\u2032 = Bb\u2032, for some constants A and B. In section 2 we derive an explicit\ndifferential equation\n\u03c6\u2032\u2032(u) + \u03b1(u)\u03c6\u2032(u)\u2212 \u03b2(u)\u03c6(u) = 0 (1.3)\nwhich ensures that \u0393\u03c6L = L\u0393\u03c6.\nThe possibilities for a and b depend upon the sign of A, and in sections 3, 4 and\n5 we consider the quadratic, hyperbolic and trigonometric cases in detail. In all cases,\nthe differential equation reduces to a linear differential equation with rational functions as\ncoefficients which has less than or equal to three singular points, and we determine the\nnature of the singularities. Thus we prove the following theorem.\nTheorem 1.1. The differential equation (1.3) may be transformed by change of variables\nto the hypergeometric equation\nx(1\u2212 x)d\n2\u03c6\ndx2\n+ {\u03bb\u2212 (\u00b5+ \u03bd + 1)x}d\u03c6\ndx\n\u2212 \u00b5\u03bd\u03c6 = 0 (1.4)\nor confluent hypergeometric equation.\nThis result covers cases relating to standard models in physics. In [11] Tracy and\nWidom considered the integral operators that have kernels of the form\nW (x, y) =\nf(x)g(y) \u2212 f(y)g(x)\nx \u2212 y (1.5)\nwhere f and g satisfy\nm(x)\nd\ndx\n[\nf(x)\ng(x)\n]\n=\n[\np(x) q(x)\n\u2212r(x) \u2212p(x)\n] [\nf(x)\ng(x)\n]\n(1.6)\nfor some real polynomial functions p(x), q(x), r(x) and m(x). Of particular interest are\nthe cases where m(x) = 1, x or 1\u2212 x2. The main application of Tracy\u2013Widom operators\nW is in random matrix theory, where they describe the eigenvalue distributions of n\u00d7 n\nrandom matrices from the generalized unitary ensemble as n\u2192\u221e.\nTracy and Widom introduced an indirect process for computing the spectrum of W ,\nand applied it effectively to the Airy and Bessel kernels which are fundamentally important\ncases in random matrix theory; see [9, 10]. Specifically, the edge distribution is given\n2\nby det(I \u2212 WP(x,\u221e)), where P(x,\u221e) is the orthogonal projection L2(0,\u221e) \u2192 L2(x,\u221e)\nfor x > 0. Their first step was to introduce a self-adjoint Hankel operator \u0393 such that\n\u03932 = W, then to use the spectral theory of Hankel operators to deduce information about\nthe spectrum of W .\nThe identity W = \u03932 is equivalent to the factorization of kernels\nf(x)g(y) \u2212 f(y)g(x)\nx \u2212 y =\n\u222b \u221e\n0\n\u03c6(x+ t)\u03c6(y + t) dt. (1.7)\nNow \u0393\u03c6 is Hilbert\u2013Schmidt if and only if\n\u222b\u221e\n0\nt|\u03c6(t)|2dt < \u221e. If \u0393\u03c6 is Hilbert\u2013Schmidt,\nthen \u03932\u03c6 is of trace class, and det(I \u2212 \u03932\u03c6) is defined.\nIn [2, 3] we considered several differential equations of the form (1.5) and resolved\nwhether factorization of W takes place, giving explicit formulae for \u03c6; several important\nexamples involve the confluent hypergeometric equation, which may be reduced by change\nof variable to Whittaker\u2019s equation. For a more general statement about reducing systems,\nand how changes of variable can affect factorization, see [3, section 3].\nBy carrying out the reduction in Theorem 1.1 explicitly, we recover the Tracy\u2013Widom\nkernels as special cases of a more general theory, and also obtain new examples of com-\nmuting \u0393\u03c6 and L; there remain a few residual cases that we have not been able to solve\nexplicitly in terms of standard functions.\nIn section 6 we present results concerning the rate of decay of the singular numbers\nof \u0393 under hypotheses that are well suited to applications in random matrix theory.\nWe follow standard notation as used in [4], and let L\n(\u03b1)\nn be the Laguerre polynomial\nof degree n and order \u03b1, so\nL(\u03b1)n (s) =\ns\u2212\u03b1\nn!\nes\ndn\ndsn\n(\ne\u2212ssn+\u03b1\n)\n(s > 0). (1.8)\n2. The main result\nTheorem 2.1. Let \u0393 be the Hankel operator that has kernel \u03c6(x + y), let L be the\ndifferential operator\nLf(x) = \u2212 d\ndx\n(\na(x)\ndf\ndx\n)\n+ b(x)f(x), (2.1)\nwhere a\u2032\u2032\u2032(x) = Aa\u2032(x) and a(0) = 0.\n(i) Then there exists a real function \u03b1 such that \u03b1(x+y) = (a\u2032(x)\u2212a\u2032(y))\/(a(x)\u2212a(y)).\n(ii) Suppose further that \u03b2(x+ y) = (b(x)\u2212 b(y))\/(a(x)\u2212 a(y)) for some real function\n\u03b2 and that\n\u03c6\u2032\u2032(u) + \u03b1(u)\u03c6\u2032(u)\u2212 \u03b2(u)\u03c6(u) = 0. (2.2)\n3\nThen the operators \u0393 and L commute on C\u221ec (0,\u221e).\nProof. Let Tt : L\n2(0,\u221e) \u2192 L2(0,\u221e) be the translation operator Ttf(x) = f(x + t) and\nT \u2020t the adjoint for t > 0. Then by the fundamental property of Hankel operators, we\nhave Tt\u0393 = \u0393T\n\u2020\nt and hence\n\u2202\n\u2202x\u0393 = \u2212\u0393 \u2202\u2202x on C\u221ec (0,\u221e). To exploit this, we introduce the\nexpression\n\u03a6(x, y) = (a(y)\u2212 a(x))\u03c6\u2032\u2032(x+ y) + (a\u2032(y)\u2212 a\u2032(x))\u03c6\u2032(x+ y)\u2212 (b(y) \u2212 b(x))\u03c6(x + y); (2.3)\nthen by successive integrations by parts, we obtain\n(L\u0393 \u2212 \u0393L)f(x) =\n[\n\u03c6(x + y)a(y)f \u2032 (y) \u2212 \u03c6\u2032(x + y)a(y)f(y)\n]\u221e\n0\n+\n\u222b \u221e\n0\n\u03a6(x, y)f(y) dy. (2.4)\nThe term in square brackets vanishes since a(0) = 0; so the operators \u0393 and L commute\nif and only if \u03a6 = 0. The main idea is to reduce the condition \u03a6 = 0 to the differential\nequation\n(\na(x) \u2212 a(y))(\u03c6\u2032\u2032(x + y) + \u03b1(x + y)\u03c6\u2032(x + y) \u2212 \u03b2(x + y)\u03c6(x + y)) = 0, (2.5)\ninvolving functions \u03b1 and \u03b2 of only one variable u = x+y. The following lemma guarantees\nthe existence of such \u03b1 and \u03b2 under suitable hypotheses, and hence gives the proof of\nTheorem 2.1.\nLemma 2.2. Suppose that a and b are three times continuously differentiable and non\nconstant real functions.\n(i) There exists a differentiable function \u03b1 such that\n\u03b1(x + y) =\na\u2032(x) \u2212 a\u2032(y)\na(x) \u2212 a(y) (2.6)\nif and only if a\u2032\u2032\u2032(x) = Aa\u2032(x) for some constant A.\n(ii) If a\u2032\u2032\u2032(x) = Aa\u2032(x), then a(x)\u2212a(y) = f(x+y)g(x\u2212y) for some differentiable functions\nf and g.\n(iii) Suppose that, for some differentiable functions g and h,\nb(x) \u2212 b(y)\ng(x \u2212 y) = h(x+ y). (2.7)\nThen there exists a constant B such that b\u2032\u2032\u2032(x) = Bb\u2032(x).\n4\nProof. (i) (\u21d2) We have\n0 =\n( \u2202\n\u2202x\n\u2212 \u2202\n\u2202y\n)(a\u2032(x) \u2212 a\u2032(y)\na(x) \u2212 a(y)\n)\n(2.8)\n=\n(a\u2032\u2032(x)a(x) \u2212 a\u2032(x)2) \u2212 (a\u2032\u2032(y)a(y) \u2212 a\u2032(y)2) + (a(x)a\u2032\u2032 (y) \u2212 a\u2032\u2032(x)a(y))\n(a(x) \u2212 a(y))2 , (2.9)\nso we have\n\u22022\n\u2202x\u2202y\n(\na(x)a\u2032\u2032 (y) \u2212 a\u2032\u2032(x)a(y)\n)\n= 0, (2.10)\nwhich soon reduces to a\u2032\u2032\u2032(x) = Aa\u2032(x) for some constant A.\n(i) (\u21d0) There are three main families of solutions of the differential equation a\u2032\u2032\u2032(x) =\nAa\u2032(x), depending upon the sign of A:\n(Q) quadratic case when A = 0 and a(x) = q2x\n2 + q1x, with q2 and q1 not both zero,\nthen\n\u03b1(u) =\n2q2\nq2u+ q1\n; (2.11)\n(H) hyperbolic case where A > 0 and a(x) = h1 cosh tx+h2 sinh tx+h3, with t\n2 = A,\nh3 = \u2212h1 and h1 and h2 not both zero, then a(0) = 0 and\n\u03b1(u) =\nth1 cosh tu\/2 + th2 sinh tu\/2\nh1 sinh tu\/2 + h2 cosh tu\/2\n; (2.12)\n(C) circular case when A < 0 and a(x) = c1 cos tx + c2 sin tx + c3, where t\n2 = \u2212A,\nc3 = \u2212c1, and c1 and c2 not both zero; then a(0) = 0 and\n\u03b1(u) =\n\u2212tc1 cos tu\/2\u2212 tc2 sin tu\/2\n\u2212c1 sin tu\/2 + c2 cos tu\/2 . (2.13)\n(ii) One considers cases (Q),(H) and (C), and applies the addition rule of trigonometry\nor hyperbolic trigonometry to factorize a(x) \u2212 a(y).\n(iii) When such g and h exist, we have\n( \u2202\n\u2202x\n\u2212 \u2202\n\u2202y\n)(b(x) \u2212 b(y)\ng(x \u2212 y)\n)\n= 0, (2.14)\nwhich reduces to\nb\u2032(x) + b\u2032(y)\nb(x) \u2212 b(y) =\n2g\u2032(x \u2212 y)\ng(x \u2212 y) , (2.15)\nand arguing as in (i), we deduce that b\u2032\u2032\u2032(x) = Bb\u2032(x) for some constant B.\n5\nRemark. Without loss of generality we can assume that a and b are bounded above or\nbelow on (0,\u221e). If a(x) \u2265 0 for all x > 0 and b is bounded below, then the quadratic form\nassociated with L is bounded below on C\u221ec (0,\u221e), and hence L admits of a self-adjoint\nextension by Friedrichs\u2019s theorem.\n3. Quadratic cases\nIn this section, we determine all the quadratic and linear choices of a and b and the\ncorresponding \u03c6 such that L and \u0393\u03c6 commute. We look for \u03b1 and \u03b2 as in Theorem 2.1.\nLemma 3.1. Suppose that a(x) = q2x\n2 + q1x + q0. Then \u03b2 of Theorem 2.1 exists if and\nonly if b is quadratic or linear; so that b(x) = b2x\n2 + b1x+ b0, and then\n\u03b2(x) =\nb2x+ b1\nq2x+ q1\n. (3.1)\nProof. We need to find \u03b2 and b such that\nb(x) \u2212 b(y)\nx \u2212 y = (q2(x + y) + q1)\u03b2(x + y), (3.2)\nso b\u2032\u2032\u2032(x) = Bb\u2032(x) by Lemma 2.2. Hence b must belong to one of the types (Q), (H) and\n(C), and evidently by (2.15) only a quadratic has the right form.\nProposition 3.2. The differential equation (2.2) for \u03c6 is\n\u2212\u03c6\u2032\u2032(u) \u2212 2q2\nq2u+ q1\n\u03c6\u2032(u) +\nb2u+ b1\nq2u+ q1\n\u03c6(u) = 0, (3.3)\nwhich may be transformed by change of variables to an elementary or confluent form of\nthe hypergeometric differential equation.\nProof. This formula follows from Theorem 2.1 and Lemma 3.1. The differential equation\n(3.3) has less than or equal to two singular points, the only possibilities being \u2212q1\/q2 and\ninfinity. Determining the nature of the singularities in all possible cases below, we find that\ncases Q(i) and Q(ii) are trivial; cases Q(iii) and Q(iv) are elementary; in cases Q(iv)-(viii),\ninfinity is an irregular singular point; in cases Q(vi)-(viii) \u2212q1\/q2 is a regular singular\npoint. We deduce that as a special case of [12, p. 352] and [4, p. 1084], the solution is\neither an elementary function or may be expressed in terms of confluent hypergeometric\nfunctions.\nExamples 3.3. (Quadratic cases). We now carry out a systematic reduction of the (3.3),\nbearing in mind that we wish to have a continuous Hankel operator \u0393\u03c6.\n6\nQ(i) If q1 = q2 = 0, then a(x) = 0 and b(x) is constant by (2.3).\nAfter translating the variable u, we assume henceforth without losing generality that\nexactly one of q1 and q2 is non-zero.\nQ(ii) If q2 = b2 = b1 = 0, then \u03c6 is linear, so does not give a continuous Hankel\noperator.\nQ(iii) If b2 = b1 = 0, q2 > 0 and q1 \u2265 0, then\n\u03c6(u) = C1 +\nC2\nq2u+ q1\n. (3.4)\nIn particular, when q2 = 1, q1 = 0, C1 = 0 and C2 = 1, we thus obtain Carleman\u2019s\noperator \u0393 with kernel 1\/(x + y). Carleman\u2019s operator is continuous on L2(0,\u221e) and\nhas spectrum [0, pi] with multiplicity two by a result due to Power [6]. Both \u0393 and the\ndifferential operator L = \u2212 ddx\n(\nx2 ddx\n)\nare multipliers for the Mellin transform, so this case\nof Theorem 2.1 was to be expected.\nQ(iv) If q2 = b2 = 0 and b1, q1 6= 0, then \u03c6 is hyperbolic or trigonometric according to\nthe sign of b1\/q1. In particular, b1 = q1 gives \u03c6(u) = e\n\u2212u, and \u0393\u03c6 is a rank-one continuous\nHankel operator. We defer the case of b1\/q1 < 0 until section 5.\nQ(v) If q2 = 0 and b2 6= 0, then we obtain the Airy equation. In particular, if\na(x) = x and b(x) = x(x + s), then \u03c6 satisfies \u03c6\u2032\u2032(u) = (u + s)\u03c6(u), so the Airy function\n\u03c6(u) = Ai(u + s) gives a solution. Here the associated Hankel operator \u0393\u03c6 is Hilbert\u2013\nSchmidt, and L has discrete spectrum as described by Titchmarsh\u2019s theory of oscillations\n[8]; Tracy and Widom discuss the asymptotics of the common sequence of eigenfunctions\nin various ranges [9]. The Hankel operator \u0393\u03c6 has square\nAi(x)Ai\u2032(y) \u2212Ai\u2032(x)Ai(y)\nx \u2212 y , (3.5)\nwhich is the famous Airy kernel as used in [9] to describe the soft edge of eigenvalues\ndistributions from the Gaussian unitary ensemble.\nWhen q1 = 1 and b2 < 0, we obtain \u03c6\n\u2032\u2032(u) + u\u03c6(u) = 0 by translation and rescaling,\nand the general solution of this is\n\u03c6(u) = C1u\n1\/2J1\/3\n(2\n3\nu3\/2\n)\n+ C2u\n1\/2J\u22121\/3\n(2\n3\nu3\/2\n)\n, (3.6)\nfor typical C1 and C2 with asymptotics [5, p.133]\n\u03c6(u) \u0010 Cu\u22121\/4 cos(2\n3\nu3\/2 + c\n)\n(u\u2192\u221e).\n7\nQ(vi) If b2 = 0 and b1, q2 6= 0, then we obtain after translation and rescaling the\nequation\n\u2212\u03c6\u2032\u2032(u)\u2212 2\nu\n\u03c6\u2032(u) \u00b1 1\n4u\n\u03c6(u) = 0 (3.7)\nwith solutions including [5, p.250]\n\u03c6+(u) = u\n\u22121\/2K1(\n\u221a\nu), \u03c6\u2212(u) = u\u22121\/2J1(\n\u221a\nu). (3.8)\nWe have by [5, p. 435]\n\u03c6+(u) \u0010\n\uf8f1\uf8f2\n\uf8f3\n1\nu\nas u\u2192 0+(\npi\n2\n)1\/2\nu\u22123\/4e\u2212\n\u221a\nu as u\u2192\u221e, (3.9)\nso \u0393\u03c6+ defines a continuous linear operator on L\n2(0,\u221e) which is not Hilbert\u2013Schmidt; but\nthe compression of \u0393\u03c6+ to L\n2(x,\u221e) is Hilbert\u2013Schmidt for x > 0. Further by [5],\n\u03c6\u2212(u) \u0010\n\uf8f1\uf8f2\n\uf8f3\n1\n2 as u\u2192 0+(\npi\n2\n)1\/2\nu\u22123\/4 cos(\n\u221a\nu\u2212 3pi\/4) as u\u2192\u221e, (3.10)\nso \u0393\u03c6\n\u2212\nis not Hilbert\u2013Schmidt. As in [3, 2.3], the associated integrable operator is\nx\u03c6\u2212(x)(y\u03c6\u2212(y))\u2032 \u2212 (x\u03c6\u2212(x))\u2032y\u03c6\u2212(y)\nx \u2212 y =\n1\n4\n\u222b \u221e\n0\n\u03c6\u2212(x+ t)\u03c6\u2212(y + t) dt.\nQ(vii) If b2, q2 6= 0, then we obtain after translation the equation\n\u2212\u03c6\u2032\u2032(u)\u2212 2\nu\n\u03c6\u2032(u) +\n(b2\nq2\n+\nb1\nq2u\n)\n\u03c6(u) = 0. (3.11)\nIn particular, when b1 = 0, we can rescale to the equation\n\u2212\u03c6\u2032\u2032(u)\u2212 2\nu\n\u03c6\u2032(u)\u00b1 \u03c6(u) = 0\nwith solutions\n\u03c6+(u) =\ne\u2212u\nu\n, \u03c6\u2212(u) =\n\u03ba1 cosu+ \u03ba2 sinu\nu\n. (3.12)\nBy Theorem 2.1 of [3], with f(x) = e\u2212x and\ng(x) = e\u2212x\n\u222b \u221e\n0\ne\u22122tdt\nx + t\n,\nwe have\nf(x)g(y) \u2212 f(y)g(x)\nx \u2212 y =\n\u222b \u221e\n0\n\u03c6+(x + t)\u03c6+(y + t) dt. (3.13)\n8\nThis \u0393\u03c6+ defines a continuous linear operator on L\n2(0,\u221e), such that the compression to\nL2(x,\u221e) is Hilbert\u2013Schmidt for x > 0.\nFurther, \u0393\u03c6\n\u2212\ndefines a continuous linear operator on L2(0,\u221e) since the kernel is a\nsum of Schur multiples of the Carleman operator, namely\n\u03c6\u2212(x + y) = \u03ba1\n(cosx cos y\nx + y\n\u2212 sinx sin y\nx+ y\n)\n+ \u03ba2\n( sinx cos y\nx+ y\n+\ncosx sin y\nx+ y\n)\n. (3.14)\nWith f(x) = eix and\ng(x) = eix\n\u222b \u221e\n0\ne2itdt\nx+ t\n, (3.15)\nwe have by Theorem 2.1 of [3] the identity\nf(x)g(y) \u2212 f(y)g(x)\nx \u2212 y =\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nei(x+y+2t)dt\n(x + t)(y + t)\n. (3.16)\nQ(viii) Now we consider (3.11) when q2 = b2 = 1, and b1 = \u22122(n + 1). Then\ng(u) = u\u03c6(2\u22121u) satisfies Laguerre\u2019s equation\ng\u2032\u2032(u) +\n(\u22121\n4\n+\nn+ 1\nu\n)\ng(u) = 0, (3.17)\nso that, when n + 1 is a positive integer, g(u) = ue\u2212u\/2L(1)n (u) and \u03c6(u) = e\u2212uL\n(1)\nn (2u)\ngives a solution. See 2.2 of [3] for the corresponding Tracy\u2013Widom operator.\nThis gives a complete catalogue of the possible quadratic cases.\n4. Hyperbolic cases\nIn this section we consider the case in which a and b are hyperbolic functions, giving\nsome L, and obtain \u0393 in terms of standard special functions such that L and \u0393 commute.\nWithout loss of generality we can choose t = 2, since other cases occur by rescal-\ning. The change of variables x = e\u22122u gives a unitary transformation L2((0,\u221e); du) \u2192\nL2((0, 1); dx\/x), and we modify the definition of the Hankel operator accordingly.\nDefinition (Hankel operator). For \u03c1 \u2208 L2((0, 1); dx\/x), the Hankel operator with kernel\n\u03c1(xy) is\n\u0393\u03c1h(x) =\n\u222b 1\n0\n\u03c1(xy)h(y)\ndy\ny\n, (4.1)\nwhere h is in some subspace of L2((0, 1); dy\/y).\nLemma 4.1. Suppose that a is hyperbolic, so a(x) = h1 cosh tx+h2 sinh tx+h3 where h1\nand h2 are not both zero. Then \u03b2 of Theorem 2.1 exists if and only if b(x) = h4 cosh tx+\nh5 sinh tx + h6 for some constants and then\n\u03b2(v) =\nh4 sinh tv\/2 + h5 cosh tv\/2\nh1 sinh tv\/2 + h2 cosh tv\/2\n. (4.2)\n9\nProof. This follows from Lemma 2.2 since we need to find \u03b2 and b such that\nb(x) \u2212 b(y)\nsinh t(x \u2212 y)\/2 = 2\n(\nh1 sinh t(x + y)\/2 + h2 cosh t(x + y)\/2\n)\n\u03b2(x + y). (4.3)\nHence b\u2032\u2032\u2032(x) = Bb\u2032(x), and of the types (Q), (C) and (H), only a hyperbolic b has the\nright form with v = x + y.\nProposition 4.2. (i) With t = 2 and x = e\u22122u, the differential equation (2.2) for \u03c6\nbecomes in the new variable\nd2\u03c6\ndx2\n+\n2(h2 \u2212 h1)\nh1 + h2 + (h2 \u2212 h1)x\nd\u03c6\ndx\n\u2212 h4 + h5 + (h5 \u2212 h4)x\n4x2(h1 + h2 + (h2 \u2212 h1)x)\u03c6 = 0, (4.4)\nand the commuting differential operator L becomes\n\u2212 d\ndx\n(\n2x\n{\n(h1 \u2212 h2)x2 + 2h3x+ (h1 + h2)\n} df\ndx\n)\n+\n(x\n2\n(h4 \u2212 h5) + h6 + 1\n2x\n(h4 + h5)\n)\nf.\n(ii) The equation (4.4) may be reduced by change of variables to the hypergeometric\nequation or the confluent hypergeometric equation.\nProof. (i) We have\n\u03b1 =\n2h1(1 + x) + 2h2(1\u2212 x)\nh1(1\u2212 x) + h2(1 + x) (0 < x < 1), (4.5)\nand by Lemma 4.1 we have\n\u03b2 =\nh4(1\u2212 x) + h5(1 + x)\nh1(1\u2212 x) + h2(1 + x) (0 < x < 1), (4.6)\nso (2.2) reduces as stated. One obtains the formula for L by changing variables.\n(ii) In 4.3 below, we consider the nature of the singular points of the differential\nequation. Effectively there are four constants in (4.4), namely h1 \u00b1 h2 and h4 \u00b1 h5; by\ntaking h3 = \u2212h1, we ensure that a(0) = 0. One can easily verify that the effect of the\nchange of variable x = 1\/y is to preserve the shape of the formula (4.4) and to interchange\nthe constants h1 + h2 \u2194 h2 \u2212 h1 and h4 + h5 \u2194 h5 \u2212 h4.\nIn cases H(i), H(iii) and H(vii) below, there are two regular singular points, so the\nsolution is elementary; in cases H(ii) and H(iv), the singular points are zero and infinity,\nand one of them is irregular, so the equation is confluent hypergeometric type; whereas\nin the remaining cases H(v) and H(vi), the three singular points are all regular, so the\nequation is of hypergeometric type.\n10\nExamples 4.3 (Hyperbolic cases).\nH(i) If h1 = h2 and h4 = h5, then the differential equation (4.4) reduces to\n\u03c6\u2032\u2032(u)\u2212 h4\n4h1u2\n\u03c6(u) = 0, (4.7)\nwhich has solutions \u03c6(u) = up where 4p(p \u2212 1) = h4\/h1. When p > 0, the corresponding\nHankel operator is Hilbert\u2013Schmidt.\nH(ii) If h1 = h2 and h4 6= h5, we obtain after rescaling\n\u03c6\u2032\u2032(u) +\n1\u2212 \u03bd2\n4u2\n\u03c6(u) = \u00b1 1\nu\n\u03c6(u), (4.8)\nwith \u03bd > 0 where the solutions are\n\u03c6+(u) =\n\u221a\nuK\u03bd (2\n\u221a\nu), \u03c6\u2212(u) =\n\u221a\nuJ\u03bd(2\n\u221a\nu). (4.9)\nIndeed, \u03c6+ emerges for the choice h1 = h2 = \u22121, h3 = 1, h4 = 5\u2212 \u03bd2 and h5 = \u22123\u2212 \u03bd2;\nwhereas \u03c6\u2212 emerges for h1 = h2 = \u22121, h3 = 1, h4 = \u22123\u2212 \u03bd2 and h5 = 5\u2212 \u03bd2. We have\n\u03c6+(u) \u0010\n{\n2\u22121\u0393(\u03bd)u(1\u2212\u03bd)\/2 as u\u2192 0+\n2\u22121pi1\/2u1\/4e\u22122\n\u221a\nu as u\u2192\u221e, (4.10)\nso \u0393\u03c6+ defines a Hilbert\u2013Schmidt operator on L\n2((0, 1); dx\/x) when \u03bd < 1.\nFurther, by [5, p.436] we have\n\u03c6\u2212(u) \u0010\n{\n\u0393(\u03bd + 1)\u22121u(1+\u03bd)\/2 as u\u2192 0+\npi\u22121\/2u1\/4 cos\n(\n2\n\u221a\nu\u2212 pi\u03bd2 \u2212 pi4\n)\nas u\u2192\u221e; (4.11)\nso \u0393\u03c6\n\u2212\ndefines a Hilbert\u2013Schmidt operator on L2((0, 1); dx\/x). The associated Tracy\u2013\nWidom operator on L2((0, 1); dy\/y) has kernel\n\u221a\nxJ \u2032\u03bd(2\n\u221a\nx)J\u03bd(2\n\u221a\ny) \u2212 J\u03bd(2\n\u221a\nx)\n\u221a\nyJ \u2032\u03bd(2\n\u221a\ny)\nx \u2212 y =\n\u222b 1\n0\nJ\u03bd(2\n\u221a\ntx)J\u03bd(2\n\u221a\nty)dt, (4.12)\nand the commuting differential operator is\nL\u03bdf(x) = 4\nd\ndx\n(\nx(1 \u2212 x) df\ndx\n)\n+\n(\n\u22124x+ 1\u2212 \u03bd\n2\nx\n\u2212 2\u00b5\n)\nf(x) (4.13)\nwith boundary conditions f(0) = f(1) = 0. In random matrix theory, this is associated\nwith hard edges, such as occur with the Jacobi ensemble.\n11\nH(iii) If h1 = \u2212h2 and h5 = \u2212h4, then we obtain\n\u03c6\u2032\u2032(u) +\n2\nu\n\u03c6\u2032(u) \u2212 h5\n4h2u2\n\u03c6(u) = 0, (4.14)\nso we have solutions \u03c6(u) = up where 4p2 + 4p\u2212 h5\/h2 = 0.\nH(iv) If h1 = \u2212h2 and h4 6= \u2212h5, then we change variables to \u03c6(x) = \u03c8(y) where\ny = 1\/x and obtain\nd2\u03c8\ndy2\n+\n(h4 + h5\n8h1y\n+\nh5 \u2212 h4\nh1y2\n)\n\u03c8(y) = 0. (4.15)\nAs in case H(ii), we thus we obtain solutions\n\u03c6+(x) =\n1\u221a\nx\nK\u03bd\n( 2\u221a\nx\n)\n, \u03c6\u2212(x) =\n1\u221a\nx\nJ\u03bd\n( 2\u221a\nx\n)\n.\nBy (4.10), \u03c6+ gives a Hilbert\u2013Schmidt Hankel operator on L\n2((0, 1); dx\/x); whereas, by\n(4.11), \u03c6\u2212 gives a Hankel operator which is not Hilbert\u2013Schmidt.\nH(v) When h1 6= 0, h2 = 0 and h4 = \u2212h5 6= 0, the equation (4.4) reduces to\nhypergeometric equation. In particular, if h1 = 1\/4, h2 = 0, h4 = \u2212h5, and \u00b5 and \u03bd\nsatisfy \u00b5+ \u03bd = 1 and \u00b5\u03bd = \u22122h4, then we have (1.4) with \u03bb = 0 and nonzero parameters\n\u00b5 and \u03bd; however, the usual series for the hypergeometric function F (\u00b5, \u03bd, \u03bb, x) is then\nundefined. By an identity from [4, p. 1073], the function\n\u03c6(x) = xF (\u00b5 + 1, \u03bd + 1, 2, x), (4.16)\ngives a power series solution which is analytic for |x| < 1, with \u03c6(0) = 0, and diverges\neverywhere on the circle {z : |z| = 1} by [4, p. 1066].\nH(vi) In the generic case h1 6= \u00b1h2 and h4 6= \u00b1h5, we introduce the regular singular\npoint \u03b6 = \u2212(h1 + h2)\/(h2 \u2212 h1) and parameters \u03b11, \u03b12, \u03b21 and \u03b22 by the simultaneous\nquadratic equations\n\u03b11\u03b12 = \u2212 h4 + h5\n4(h1 + h2)\n, \u03b21\u03b22 = \u2212 h5 \u2212 h4\n4(h2 \u2212 h1) ,\n\u03b11 + \u03b12 = 1, \u03b21 + \u03b22 = 1. (4.17)\nThen the differential equation (4.4) is given in Riemann\u2019s notation [12, 5] by\n\u03c6(x) = P\n\uf8f1\uf8f2\n\uf8f3\n0 \u221e \u03b6\n\u03b11 \u03b21 \u22121; x\n\u03b12 \u03b22 0\n\uf8fc\uf8fd\n\uf8fe , (4.18)\n12\nand hence by [5, p 156], may be reduced to the hypergeometric equation (1.4).\nH(vii) Finally, when h1 6= h2 and h4 = h5 = 0, as in Q(iii) we have elementary\nsolutions\n\u03c6(x) = C1 +\nC2\n(h2 \u2212 h1)x + h2 + h1 . (4.19)\n5. Circular cases\nIn this section we consider the remaining case, namely when \u03c6, a and b are circular\nfunctions. The results of this section are quite analogous to those of H(v) and H(vi);\nalthough they are somewhat contrived, since the notion of a Hankel integral operator over\nthe circle is not in common use.\nSuppose that a, b and \u03c6 have period 2pi\/t, and that a(0) = a(2pi\/t) = 0. We extend\nf \u2208 C\u221ec (0,\u221e) by f(x) = 0 for x < 0, and introduce F (y) =\n\u2211\u221e\nk=\u2212\u221e f(y + 2pik\/t), which\nis 2pi\/t periodic. Evidently\n\u222b \u221e\n0\n\u03c6(x + y)f(y)dy =\n\u222b 2pi\/t\n0\n\u03c6(x + y)F (y)dy (5.1)\nis also 2pi\/t periodic.\nDefinition (Hankel operator). The Hankel operator on L2((0, 2pi\/t); dy) with kernel \u03c6(x+\ny) is\n\u0393F (x) =\n\u222b 2pi\/t\n0\n\u03c6(x + y)F (y) dy.\nWe consider \u0393 as an operator on C\u221e(0, 2pi\/t), and look for a second-order differential\noperator L as in (1.2) such that L\u0393 = \u0393L.\nLemma 5.1. Suppose that a(x) = c1 cos tx+ c2 sin tx+ c3 is circular, where c1 and c2 are\nnot both zero. Then \u03b2 of Theorem 2.1 exists if and only if b(x) = c4 cos tx+ c5 sin tx + c6\nfor some constants and then\n\u03b2(u) =\n\u2212c4 sin tu\/2 + c5 cos tu\/2\n\u2212c1 sin tu\/2 + c2 cos tu\/2 . (5.2)\nProof. This follows from Lemma 2.2 since we need to find \u03b2 and b such that\nb(x) \u2212 b(y)\nsin t(x \u2212 y)\/2 = 2\n(\n\u2212c1 sin t(x + y)\/2 + c2 cos t(x + y)\/2\n)\n\u03b2(x + y). (5.3)\nHence b\u2032\u2032\u2032(x) = Bb\u2032(x), and of the types (Q), (H) and (C), only a circular b has the right\nform.\n13\nProposition 5.2. (i) Let \u03c4 = tan u and t = 2. Then differential equation (2.2) for \u03c6\nbecomes in the new variable\nd2\u03c6\nd\u03c4 2\n+\n2c1\nc1\u03c4 \u2212 c2\nd\u03c6\nd\u03c4\n\u2212 \u2212c4\u03c4 + c5\u2212c1\u03c4 + c2\n\u03c6(\u03c4 )\n(1 + \u03c4 2)2\n= 0, (5.4)\nand the commuting differential operator transforms to\n\u2212(1 + \u03c4 2) d\nd\u03c4\n({\nc1(1 \u2212 \u03c4 2) + 2c2\u03c4 + c3(1 + \u03c4 2)\n} df\nd\u03c4\n)\n+\n(\nc4\n1\u2212 \u03c4 2\n1 + \u03c4 2\n+ c5\n2\u03c4\n1 + \u03c4 2\n+ c6\n)\nf.\n(ii) The equation (5.4) may be reduced by change of variables to the hypergeometric\nequation.\nProof. (i) This follows from Theorem 2.1 and Lemma 5.1 by calculation.\n(ii) The differential equation has regular singular points: at c2\/c1, when c1 6= 0; at\n\u221e, when c1 = 0; and at \u00b1i, when c4 6= 0 or c5 6= 0. When c4 = c5 = 0, the equation has\nelementary solutions, as in H(vii) and Q(iii). The effect of the change of variable \u03c4 = 1\/s\nis to preserve the shape of (5.4) and to interchange the constants c1 \u2194 c2 and c4 \u2194 c5.\nBy [5, p. 156], the differential equation may be reduced by change of variables to Gauss\u2019s\nhypergeometric equation.\nExamples 5.3 (Circular case). We present solutions of the differential equations in the\nspecial case where the singular points are 0,\u00b1i. Let c1 = \u22121, c2 = 0, c4 = 3 and c5 = 0;\nso that, the differential equation in the original variables is\n\u03c6\u2032\u2032(x) + 2 cot x\u03c6\u2032(x) + 3\u03c6(x) = 0, (5.5)\nwhich has general solution\n\u03c6(x) = c7 cosx \u2212 c8(cosecx \u2212 2 sinx). (5.6)\nThe Hankel operator on L2((0, pi); dx) with kernel cos(x+ y) has rank two and eigen-\nfunctions cosx and sinx. In the new variable, the solution is the algebraic function\n\u03c6(\u03c4 ) =\nc7\u03c4 + c8(\u03c4\n2 \u2212 1)\n\u03c4\n\u221a\n\u03c4 2 + 1\n.\nProof of Theorem 1.1. The Propositions 3.2, 4.2 and 5.2 cover the three cases that\ntogether give the proof of Theorem 1.1.\n14\n6. Singular numbers of Hankel integral operators\nLet \u0393\u03c6 be the Hankel operator on L\n2(0,\u221e) with kernel \u03c6(x + y). In applications to\nrandom matrix theory, the ultimate aim of the analysis is to prove properties of det(I\u2212\u03932\u03c6).\nIf W = \u03932\u03c6, and W has eigenvalues \u03bb1 \u2265 \u03bb2 \u2265 . . . listed according to multiplicity, then the\nsingular numbers of \u0393\u03c6 are sj = \u03bb\n1\/2\nj for (j = 1, 2, . . .). In this section we prove results\nwhich show that if \u03c6 is analytic on a suitable domain and satisfies various growth bounds,\nthen \u0393\u03c6 is a trace-class operator and that its singular numbers are of rapid decay. An\nimportant feature of the results is that if \u03c6(z) satisfies the hypotheses, then the translated\nfunctions \u03c6s(z) = \u03c6(s + z) also satisfy them for all s > 0, up to modified constants. This\nreflects the fact that the compression of \u03932\u03c6 to L\n2(s,\u221e) is unitarily equivalent to \u03932\u03c6s on\nL2(0,\u221e).\nDefinition (Hankel matrix). Suppose that (\u03b3j)\n\u221e\nj=1 is a sequence in `\n2(Z+). Then the\ndensely defined linear operator \u0393 with matrix [\u03b3j+k\u22121] with respect to the standard or-\nthonormal basis of `2(Z+) is a Hankel operator.\nTheorem 6.1. Let \u03c6 be an analytic function on the half plane {z = x + iy : x > \u2212\u03b4} for\nsome \u03b4 > 0, and suppose that there exists \u03b5 > 0 and M\u03b5(\u03b4) > 0 such that\n|\u03c6(z)e\u03b5z | \u2264M\u03b5(\u03b4) (<z > \u2212\u03b4). (6.1)\n(i) Then \u0393\u03c6 has singular numbers sj such that\njpsj \u2192 0 (j \u2192\u221e) (6.2)\nfor all integers p > 0.\n(ii) For all integers p > 1, there exists Cp > 0 such that\nlog det(I + x\u03932\u03c6) \u2264 Cpx1\/p (x > 0), (6.3)\nand the entire function det(I + z\u03932\u03c6) has order zero.\nProof. (i) The operator with kernel \u03b5\u22121\u03c6(\u03b5\u22121(x+y)) is unitarily equivalent to the operator\nwith kernel \u03c6(x + y), and \u03b5\u22121\u03c6(z\/\u03b5) satisfies (6.1) with \u03b5 = 1, M1(\u03b5\u03b4) = \u03b5\u22121M\u03b5(\u03b4) on\n{z : <z > \u2212\u03b5\u03b4}. Hence we assume without loss of generality that \u03c6 has been rescaled\nso that it satisfies (6.1) with \u03b5 = 1. Let hn(s) = e\n\u2212sL(0)n (2s), so that (hj )\u221ej=0 gives\nan orthonormal basis of L2(0,\u221e), and is associated with a unitary equivalence between\nL2(0,\u221e) and `2(Z+). Then the Hankel integral operator \u0393\u03c6 on L2(0,\u221e) is unitarily\n15\nequivalent to the Hankel matrix \u0393 = [\u03b3j+k\u22121]\u221ej,k=1 on `\n2(Z+), where \u03b3j =\n\u222b\u221e\n0\n\u03c6(x)hj(x) dx\nas in [6]. We shall show that the entries of \u0393 are of rapid decay as j + k \u2192\u221e.\nBy integrating repeatedly by parts, we find that\n\u03b3j =\n\u222b \u221e\n0\n\u03c6(x)hj(x) dx\n=\n(\u22121)j\nj!\n\u222b \u221e\n0\n( dj\ndxj\n(\nex\u03c6(x)\n))\nxje\u22122x dx (6.4)\nwhere by (6.1) ez\u03c6(z) is analytic and bounded inside the circle with centre x and radius\nx + \u03b4. Applying Cauchy\u2019s estimates, we obtain\nxj\n\u2223\u2223\u2223 dj\ndxj\n(\nex\u03c6(x)\n)\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 j!M1(\u03b4)\n( x\nx+ \u03b4\n)j\n(6.5)\nand hence\n|\u03b3j | \u2264M1(\u03b4)\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nxj\n(x + \u03b4)j\ne\u22122x dx, (6.6)\nand summing this estimate over j we obtain by the monotone convergence theorem\n\u221e\u2211\nj=1\njp+1|\u03b3j | \u2264M1(\u03b4)\n\u222b \u221e\n0\n\u221e\u2211\nj=0\n(j + p+ 1)!\nj!\n( x\nx+ \u03b4\n)j\ne\u22122xdx\n\u2264 M1(\u03b4)\n\u03b4p+2\n\u222b \u221e\n0\n(x + \u03b4)p+2e\u22122xdx, (6.7)\nwhere the last step follows from the binomial theorem.\nWe approximate \u0393 by the Hankel matrix \u0393N = [\u03b3j+k\u22121I{(j,k):j+k\u2264N}], which is zero\noutside the top left corner and has rank less than or equal to N . By considering approxi-\nmation numbers [7], we find that\nsN \u2264 \u2016\u0393\u2212 \u0393N\u2016B(`2), (6.8)\nand since the norm of a matrix is smaller than the absolute sum of its entries, we deduce\nthat\nsN \u2264\n\u221e\u2211\nj=N+1\nj|\u03b3j|\n\u2264 N\u2212p\n\u221e\u2211\nj=1\njp+1|\u03b3j |\n\u2264 M1(\u03b4)\n2\u03b4p+2Np\n(\n(2\u03b4)p+2 + \u0393(p + 3)\n)\n, (6.9)\n16\nwhere we have used (6.7) at the last step. We can repeat the argument with p+ 1 instead\nof p, and hence deduce that jpsj \u2192 0 as j \u2192\u221e.\n(ii) We introduce the counting function n(t) = ]{j : ts2j \u2265 1}, and observe that by\n(6.9),\nn(t) \u2264 cpt1\/p (t > 0) (6.10)\nfor some cp > 0, since s\n2\nj \u2264 cpj\u2212p for all j and n(t) = 0 for 0 < t < \u2016\u0393\u03c6\u2016\u22122. A standard\nsummation formula then gives\nlog det(I + x\u03932\u03c6) = log\n\u221e\u220f\nj=1\n(1 + xs2j )\n= x\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nn(t)dt\nt(x + t)\n\u2264 cpx1\/ppicosec (pi\/p). (6.11)\nThis gives the asserted bound on the growth of log det(I+x\u03932\u03c6), and shows that det(I+z\u0393\n2\n\u03c6)\nhas order zero.\nThe following applies to Q(vi), Q(vii) and Q(viii) of Examples 3.3.\nCorollary 6.2. Let \u03c6 be either:\n(i) e\u2212xL(1)n (2x);\n(ii) (x + s)\u22121e\u2212(x+s); or\n(iii) (x + s)\u22121\/2K\u03bd(2\n\u221a\nx+ s) where s > 0.\nThen the eigenvalues of the Hankel operator \u0393\u03c6 on L\n2(0,\u221e) are of rapid decay, so jpsj \u2192 0\nas j \u2192\u221e for all integers p.\nProof. Theorem 6.1 applies directly to \u03c6 in cases (i) and (ii), and we can adapt the proof\nof Theorem 6.1 to deal with \u03c6 in case (iii). Let z = rei\u03b8 and 0 < \u03b4 < s. One can show\nthat there exists a constant C such that\n|(z + s)1\/2K\u03bd(2\n\u221a\nz + s)ez| \u2264 C(s\u2212 \u03b4)\u22121\/2er cos \u03b8\u2212(r cos \u03b8)1\/2 (<z > \u2212\u03b4), (6.12)\nand hence that\n|\u03c8(z)ez | \u2264 C(s\u2212 \u03b4)\u22121\/2e2x+\u03b4\u2212(2x+\u03b4)1\/2 (6.13)\nwhen z lies on the circle with centre x and radius x + \u03b4. Now we can apply Cauchy\u2019s\nestimates as in (6.5), and then follow the proof of Theorem 6.1.\n17\nLet the Fourier transform of f be Ff(\u03be) = \u222b\u221e\u2212\u221e e\u2212i\u03bexf(x)dx\/\u221a2pi.\nProposition 6.3. Let \u03c6 be an analytic function on the strip {z = x + iy : |y| < \u03c3} and\nsuppose that there exist K, \u03b4 > 0 such that |\u03c6(z)| \u2264 Ke\u2212\u03b4|x| for all real x and |y| < \u03c3.\nThen there exist C1 and \u03ba2 > 0 such that the singular numbers of the Hankel operator \u0393\u03c6\nwith kernel \u03c6(x + y) all satisfy\nsN (\u0393\u03c6) \u2264 C1e\u2212\u03ba2N\n1\/3\n. (6.14)\nProof. By shifting the line of integration in the Fourier integral, one can show that F\u03c6\nis analytic on the strip {\u03b6 = \u03be + i\u03b7 : |\u03b7| < \u03b4}. Further, there exist C3 and \u03b5 > 0 such that\n|F\u03c6(\u03be + i\u03b7)| \u2264 C3e\u2212\u03b5|\u03be| for all \u03be + i\u03b7 on this strip.\nThe Fourier transform of hn is easy to compute, and by Plancherel\u2019s theorem we have\n\u03b3n =\n\u222b \u221e\n0\n\u03c6(x)hn(x) dx =\ni\u221a\n2pi\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nF\u03c6(\u03be) (\u03be \u2212 i)\nn\n(\u03be + i)n+1\nd\u03be. (6.15)\nWe shift the line of integration up to {\u03b6 = \u03be + i\u03b4 : \u2212\u221e < \u03be < \u221e}, and split the range of\nintegration; the middle range of integration [\u2212\u03be0, \u03be0] is dominated by the rational factor,\nwhere we observe that\n\u2223\u2223\u2223 (\u03be + i\u03b4 \u2212 i)n\n(\u03be + i\u03b4 + i)n+1\n\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 (\u03be20 + (1 \u2212 \u03b4)2\n\u03be20 + (1 + \u03b4)\n2\n)n\/2\n(|\u03be| \u2264 \u03be0); (6.16)\nmeanwhile, the contributions from |\u03be| \u2265 \u03be0 are bounded by\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\n\u222b \u2212\u03be0\n\u2212\u221e\n+\n\u222b \u221e\n\u03be0\n(\u03be + i\u03b4 \u2212 i)n\n(\u03be + i\u03b4 + i)n+1\nF\u03c6(\u03be + i\u03b4) d\u03be\n\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264\n\u222b \u2212\u03be0\n\u2212\u221e\n+\n\u222b \u221e\n\u03be0\n|F\u03c6(\u03be + i\u03b4)|d\u03be. (6.17)\nIn particular, with \u03be0 = n\n1\/3, we obtain the bound\n|\u03b3n| \u2264 2n1\/3C3\n(n2\/3 + (1 \u2212 \u03b4)2\nn2\/3 + (1 + \u03b4)2\n)n\/2\n+\n2C3\n\u03b5\ne\u2212\u03b5n\n1\/3\n. (6.18)\nDue to a similar approximation argument as (6.7), the singular numbers of \u0393\u03c6 consequently\nsatisfy (6.14).\nThis result applies to an orthonormal sequence of functions which is used to analyse\nthe Gaussian orthogonal ensemble as in [1].\nCorollary 6.4. Let \u03c6n be the n\nth Hermite function. Then the singular numbers of the\nHankel operator \u0393\u03c6n on L\n2(0,\u221e) with kernel \u03c6n(x + y) are of rapid decay as in (6.14).\n18\nProof. The hypotheses of Proposition 6.3 hold for \u03c6n(z) = Hn(z)e\n\u2212z2\/4, where Hn is the\nHermite polynomial of degree n.\nReferences\n[1] G.
