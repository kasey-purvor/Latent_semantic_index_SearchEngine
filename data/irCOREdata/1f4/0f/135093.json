The purpose is to assess the role of air viscosity on \ndynamic wetting failure which hitherto has been speculated on but not measured.  In \nthis paper we used dip coating as the model experimental flow and report data on air \nentrainment  velocity Vae we measured with a series of silicone oils in a range of \nviscosities in a vacuum chamber where the pressure can be reduced from atmospheric \ndown to a few mbar when the mean molecular free path of air is large and air ceases \nto have a viscosity. To complement earlier work, we carried out the experiments with \na range of substrates of varying roughness.  The substrates were chosen so that for \neach one, their two sides differ in roughness.  This enables simultaneous comparative \nobservation  of  their  wetting  performance  and  reduces  the  experimental  error  in \nassessing  the  role  of  roughness.    The  data  presented  here  capture  the  effects  of \nviscosity, roughness and air pressure but the important result of this study is that Vae \ncan be increased considerably (exponentially) when the pressure is reduced with the \nsuggestion that Vae approaches infinity as pressure approaches zero.

INTRODUCTION \n \nDynamic wetting is the process by which air or another gas on and around a solid \nsurface is displaced by a liquid and its simplest experimental representation is the \n                                                            \n1 corresponding author : Tel (01274) 383721 Fax (01274) 385700 Email H.Benkreira@bradford.ac.uk   2 \nsteady dipping of a solid web into a pool of liquid.  Dynamic wetting occurs in many \nflow situations but most typically in all coating flows which must all begin with a \ndynamic wetting line which, as shown in Fig. 1, forms with the moving solid surface \n(substrate) a dynamic contact angle \uf071D.  Ablett (1923) was the first to report from his \ndip coating experiments that this contact angle increased steadily with the speed of the \nsubstrate and to approach a maximum value of 180\u00b0 at which point the displaced air \nbegins to be entrained between the solid and the displacing liquid and dynamic wetting \nfailure  can  be  said  to  occur.    In  the  practical  context  of  coating  operations,  air \nentrainment is wholly undesirable as it limits processing speeds, hence productivity \nand if unnoticed will lead to defective unsaleable films.  Clearly, understanding this \nphenomenon and perhaps postponing its occurrence to higher speeds by manipulating \nthe flow and substrate conditions is of huge industrial interest.  Deryagin and Levi \n(1964)  were  the  first  to  reveal  experimentally  how  dynamic  failure  occurred:  the \ndynamic wetting line which is originally straight, suddenly breaks up and adopts a \nsawtooth shape; the flow becomes unstable and three-dimensional and air is entrained \nat the trailing vertices where two straight-line segments of the wetting line seem to \nintersect (Fig. 1).  Several studies then followed to correlate the critical speed Vae at \nwhich  dynamic  wetting  failure  occurs  with  the  physical  properties  of  the  coating \nliquid.  All the studies agree that the coating liquid viscosity is the key parameter with \nsurface tension playing a secondary role only.  The most often quoted experimental \ncorrelation is that due to Gutoff and Kendrick (1982): \n \nVae \uf0bb\n\uf02d 511\n0 67 .\n. \uf06d         [1] \n \nwhere Vae is expressed in m\/s and \uf06d in mPa.s.  This correlation is applicable only with \nNewtonian fluids.  Non-Newtonian effects on wetting are more complicated and have \nnot been fully resolved.  Cohu and Benkreira (1998) reported that in the case of non-\nNewtonian  solutions  made  up  of  polymers  dissolved in  a solvent,  air entrainment \nspeeds computed with the viscosity of the pure solvent were a good approximation to \nthose  they  measured  with  the  polymer  solutions.    These  results  suggest  that  the \ndynamic  wetting  failure  velocity  is  determined  by  interactions  of  the  smaller \nmolecules near the contact line and not by the the polymer macromolecules and the \nbulk rheology of. coating fluid. \n  Perhaps the most fundamental explanation of dynamic wetting is that given by \nBlake and Ruschak (1979) who measured the angle \u0424 of the sawteeth shaped wetting \nline (see Fig.1) at speeds higher than Vae and observed that the product Vae cos \u0424 \nremained constant thus establishing that the component of the speed normal to the \nstraight-line segments of the wetting line was independent of the substrate velocity.  \nThey termed this component, the maximum speed of wetting, V* which they assumed \nis the maximum speed at which the wetting line can advance normal to itself.  They \nthen proposed the following mechanism of air entrainment in coating flows.  When \nthe velocity of the substrate exceeds V*, the wetting line adopts a sawtooth shape so \nthat the component of the speed of the solid normal to the segments of the wetting line \ndoes not exceed V*.  This enables the lengthened wetting lines to continue to wet the \nsolid.  However, the curvature of the wetting line is large but finite at the point where \ntwo of its straight-line segments seem to intersect, so that the tangent to the wetting \nline at this point remains normal to the velocity of the solid.  This point of the wetting \nline is then drawn into the liquid since its speed relative to the substrate cannot exceed   3 \nV*.  This explains why air is entrained only at the trailing vertices where two straight-\nline segments of the wetting line seem to intersect.  Seen like this, air entrainment \nappears as a consequence of the break-up of the wetting line which occurs because the \nspeed of the wetting line normal to itself is restricted.  Expressed mathematically, at \nspeeds  V equal  or higher than V*, the wetting line segments adopt the minimum \npossible inclination \uf046 such that: \n \ncos \uf046 = V*\/ V   (V\u2265V\n*)      [2] \n \nCohu  and  Benkreira  (1998)  observed  that  a  corollary  to  this  equation  is  that  air \nentrainment could be postponed to velocities Vae greater than V* in coating flows \nwhere the wetting line is not perpendicular but tilted at an angle \uf062 to the direction of \nsubstrate motion.  They tested this corollary in their angled dip coating (Cohu and \nBenkreira, 1998) and angled die coating (Benkreira and Cohu, 1998) experiments at \nvarious angles \uf062 with a range of different viscosities and surface tensions coating \nliquids and found the corollary to hold true and that: \n \nVae\uf020= V* \/cos \uf062        [3] \n \nwhere V* is the air entrainment velocity at \uf062=0 .  Put in numbers, this corollary states \nthat air entrainment speed can be doubled by tilting the angle of entry \uf062\uf020from 0 to 60\n0. \n  Another corollary to the concept of the maxiumum speed of wetting is that \nroughness should decrease Vae on the basis that the wetting line must move a greater \ndistance  across  a  rough  surface  than  a  flat  surface  of  equivalent  length.    This \ncontradicts the hydrodynamic proposition made by Scriven (1982) that with rough \nsurfaces, air can escape through the valleys between peaks in the surface.  The data of \nBuonopane et al. (1986) suggests that this is the case with roughness increasing Vae in \nsome  cases  by  a  factor  as  much  as  12  in  comparison  with  smooth  substrates.  \nRecently, Benkreira (2004) carried out experiments with substrates that were smooth \non  one  side  and  rough  on  their  other  side  and  established  that  roughness  could \nincrease or decrease Vae depending on the value of the viscosity of the coating fluid.  \nIn particular, he observed that a rough substrate will only coat faster than a smooth \nsubstrate when the viscosity exceeds a critical value.  The higher the roughness, the \nlarger the critical viscosity will be.  In other words, at a given viscosity, normally a \nsmooth  surface coats  faster than a rough surface but  beyond a critical  viscosity a \n\u201cswitch\u201d or the reverse is observed.  The data showed that the rougher the surface, the \nlarger the critical viscosity will be.  This observation is very useful in practice as it \nimplies that if one chooses carefully roughness one can coat viscous formulation at \nunexpectedly very high speeds. These results suggest that air entrainment may not be \njust  a  molecular  scale  event  as  inferred  by  Blake  and  Rushack  (1979)  and  that \nhydrodynamic effects play an important role. \n  Clearly,  despite  all  the  progress  made  in  understanding  dynamic  wetting \nfailure and the established fact that the formation of these triangular structures at the \ncontact line is a prerequisite for air entrainment, we still do not have an accepted full \nproof theory of dynamic wetting.  We still do not know why the triangular structure \nforms  and  what  is  their  physical  origin  and  the  physical  origin  of  the  assumed \nmaximum speed of wetting.  Also, the difficulties of resolving our observations of \ndynamic wetting at the very small scale makes it difficult to measure accurately the   4 \ndynamic contact angle and assess how and with what it changes.  These difficulties \ndivide the type of theories that may be devised to explain this important phenomenon.  \nExisting theories of dynamic wetting that can fit available experimental data broadly \ndivide into  two groups.  The first group (Blake  and Haynes, 1969; Blake, 1993 ; \nShikhmurzaev, 1993, 1997) considers events occuring at the molecular scale at the \ndynamic wetting line and require very careful observations of the dynamic wetting \nregion.    They  predict  the  existence  of  a  maximum  speed  of  wetting  even  if  the \ndisplaced phase (i.e. air) is inviscid.  In other words, air is not responsible for the \nbreak-up of the wetting line that ultimately causes air entrainment as explained above.  \nOn the other hand, the second group of theories (Teletzke et al., 1988; Miyamoto, \n1991  and  references  therein)  consider  events  at  macroscopic  scale  -  the \nhydrodynamics of the air-liquid system.  In other words, these theories consider air \nviscosity to be important.  Being a viscous fluid, air is assumed to be always entrained \nas an invisible film due to the viscous drag arising from the movement of the surfaces \nof both the liquid and solid.  As the substrate speed increases, the air film thickens, \nleading to visible air entrainment.  Although such a model of dynamic wetting do not \nactually  predict  the  break-up  of  the  wetting  line  into  a  sawteeth  pattern,  the \nexperiments of Veverka and Aidun (1997) suggest that the formation of triangular air \npockets could be due to interfacial instability of the liquid surface adjacent to the \nentrained flat layer of air.  Interestingly, the hydrodynamic model of dynamic wetting \npredict the existence of a maximum speed of wetting only when the viscosity of the \ndisplaced phase is non zero (Cox, 1986).   \n  It is also interesting to note that the hydrodynamic model seems to apply better \nwhen  the  displaced  phase  is  a  viscous  liquid  instead  of  air.    Indeed,  whilst  the \nappearence of sawtooth-shaped wetting lines at an air\/liquid\/solid interface is widely \ndocumented in the literature (e.g. Deryagin and Levi, 1959; Wilkinson, 1975; Burley \nand Kennedy, 1976; Blake and Ruschak, 1979; O\u2019Connell, 1989; Cohu and Benkreira, \n1998), no similar observations have been reported for situations where the displaced \nphase is a viscous liquid.  This suggests that the phenomenon of dynamic wetting \nfailure does not relate with the fact that air has a viscosity but may be somewhat \nhindered by the hydrodynamic entrainment of the displaced phase when the latter is \nviscous.    In  order  to  provide  experimental  evidence  of  this  hypothesis,  dynamic \nwetting experiments in the absence of surrounding air or gas are required.  This is \nprecisely the subject of this paper which reports an experimental study of  the dynamic \nwetting of a solid substrate by a liquid under high vacuum pressures down to 1 mbar.  \nUnder these pressures, the mean molecular free path of air is large\n2 and about 66 \u00b5m, \nof order similar or larger than the thickness of the air film inside the triangular pockets \n(measured under atmospheric pressure to be 10 to 30  \u00b5m by Severtson and Aidun. \n1996), the air molecules rarely run into each other and air ceases to have a viscosity.  \nUnder such conditions, the presence of the triangular structures at the dynamic wetting \nline would give evidence in favour of molecular the ories, especially if the critical \nspeeds are found to be independent on whether air is present or not.  Conversely, the \nabsence of such structures would prove the active role of air and hydrodynamics in \ntheir formation. \n \n2.  EXPERIMENTAL METHOD  \n \n                                                            \n2For air at 300K, the mean free path in mm =6.6\/P with P in Pa.   5 \nThe Apparatus: The experimental apparatus is depicted schematically in Fig. 2 and \nconsists essentially of a 50 mm wide tape drawn downwards through a perpex tank \ncontaining the liquid.  The dimensions of the tank were 150 \uf0b4 135 \uf0b4 90 mm (height, h, \n\uf0b4 depth, 2d, \uf0b4 width, w). The tape passed over grounded metal rollers to reduce any \nstatic charges, plunged into the liquid, emerged from a narrow slit at the bottom of the \ntank and was finally wound around a cylinder driven by a variable speed motor. This \nsimple design prevented the fluid carried along the substrate at exit of the pool from \nflowing back and entraining air bubbles into the tank. Another advantage was that the \nbulk flow of the liquid within the tank on either side of the tape far from its edges is a \nwell-defined free-surface side-driven cavity flow. The aspect ratio ac of the liquid pool \nis  defined  as  the  tape-to-wall  distance,  d, divided by the liquid  height,  H (that  is \nac=d\/H). Although the liquid height H was allowed to change during the experiments, \nas some liquid was entrained out of the pool by the substrate, the aspect ratio was \nalways kept between 0.6 and 1.6, and it was checked that the results were insensitive \nto  changes  in  ac  within  this  range.    In  all  cases,  additional  liquid  was  supplied \nregularly to the tank to compensate for the amount entrained out of the pool by the \nsubstrate. \n \nThe Vacuum Chamber: The dip coater system, including the tank and the motor, was \ndesigned to be compact, the inter-axes distance between the feed reel and the take-up \nreel being approximately 55 cm.  The whole set-up, excluding the motor, was housed \nin a 1cm thick wall, vacuum steel welded chamber (80 cm x 40 cm x 40 cm).  The \nchamber had a removable access door and three laminated glass viewing windows \naround the dynamic wetting region.  The non-welded parts were sealed with O-rings \nand rubber sleeves and the whole closed chamber was tested for leaks prior to the \nexperiments  (further details  below on the measurement of pressures).  To prevent \noverheating, the substrate winder roller was driven from the outside by a geared motor \nvia a labyrinth type vacuum seal.  The substrate speed was measured by a remote \nsensor suitably calibrated and placed inside the vacuum chamber.  A high vacuum \npump (BOC Edwards E2M 12, 2 Stage) was used to create the required pressures in \nthe chamber.  Before the air entrainment experiment could be carried out, the vacuum \npump was switch on and left for as long as it took to degas the solution tested and this \ndegassing time depends on the viscosity of the solution.  Typically with a 20 mPa.s \nsilicone oil, a vacuum of less than 10 mbar was achieved in 90 minutes whereas with \nthe 200 mPa.s it took as long as 3 hours to obtain a vacuum down to 40 mbar.  Once \nthe required vacuum was reached, the pump was switched off, then a needle valve was \nused  to  bleed-off  some  of  the  vacuum  and  we  could  begin  the  air  entrainment \nexperiments from a set minimum pressure.  Subsequent experiments were carried out \nby  further  bleeding  through  the  needle  valve.    Two  vacuum  gauges,  suitably \ncalibrated, were mounted to monitor the pressure inside the chamber, one with a large \nrange  1  down  to  0  bar  and  a  second  with  a  smaller  range  50  to  0  mbar.    The \ntemperature  of  the  coating  fluid  and  the  air  inside  the  chamber  was  monitored \nthroughout the experiments. \n \nThe Coating Fluids: In order to avoid evaporation of the coating liquids at the low \nvacuum pressures, we used a number (6) of silicone oils (Basildon Chemicals) of \npartial  pressures  << 1mbar and in  a viscosity range 10 to  500 mPa.s  and surface \ntension 18.5-20.0 mN\/m.  Glycerine-water solutions (9) with viscosities ranging from \n40 to 733 mPa.s and surface tension 65 mN\/m were also used in the experiments at   6 \natmospheric pressure.  The glycerine-water solutions were mixed at low speed for 24 \nhours  with  a  propeller  mixer  and  left  to  rest  overnight  prior  to  the  coating \nexperiments.  With this standardized method of preparation, uncertainties resulting \nfrom  undesirable  effects  such  as  absorption  of  air  moisture  by  glycerin  could  be \nminimized.  The physical properties of the liquids were measured at the temperature \nrecorded during the coating experiments, which did not vary significantly during the \nprocessing of each individual liquid.  All the experiments were conducted at room \ntemperature, that is between 20 and 25 \u00b0C.  The viscosity of the fluids were measured \nto an accuracy of \u00b1 5% in a Bohlin CVO viscometer equipped with a Peltier system \nallowing an accurate control (within 0.1 \u00b0C) of the sample temperature.  The viscosity \nwas measured over a range of shear rates and temperatures and were found to be \nNewtonian  as  expected.    The  surface  tensions  of  the  fluids  were  measured  to  an \naccuracy of \u00b1 2 % with a FTA 188 video tensiometer using the pendent drop method..  \nThe  surface  tensions  were  also  measured  at  Texp  \uf0b1  0.1  \u00b0C.    For  each  liquid,  air \nentrainment experiments, rheological characterizations, and whenever possible surface \ntension measurements were carried out on the same day to minimize errors due to air-\nmoisture absorption or bio-degradation.  The physical properties of all the coating \nfluids tested are shown in Table 1 at typical tested temperatures. \n \nThe  Substrates:  In  order  to  assess  the  relative  effect  of  surface  roughness  on  air \nentrainment under low pressures, we used 2 non porous coated papers (Pap) and 3 \npolyester (Plast) substrates.  By design and unique to this programme of research, each \nof these substrates had different front and back roughness.  Their labelling thus was \nPap1F,  Pap1B,  Pap2F,  Pap2B,  etc.  and  Plast1F,  Plast2B,  etc.    The  sourcing  of \nsubstrates  with  dual  roughness  is  very  useful  as  one  experiment  under  identical \nconditions enables the simultaneous viewing of both sides of the substrate and assess \naccurately the relative effect of roughness (see Benkreira, 2004). The topography of \nthe  substrates  was  characterized  using  three  instruments:  a  Taylor  Hobson  series \nTalysurf 4, a comparatively crude roughness measurement device, a surface-mapping \nmicroscope,  a  more  comprehensive  3D  profiling  of  the  surface  and  an  PicoForce \nMultimode Atomic Force Microscope which can zoom on roughness at a very small \nscale of scrutiny.  All three devices were used in order to distinguish between those \nsubstrate sides that were similar in roughness.  Remember that many lengths can be \nused to define roughness including peak height, valley depth, the sum of the two, their \narithmetic average, maximum, root mean square and other indices.  Table 2 gives the \nthe average peak-to-valley height roughness Rz measured using the Talysurf method \nand  is  a  comprehensive  basis  for  ranking  the  substrates.    Note  that  with  each \ninstrument and with each sample, the measurements were repeated at least 5 times.  \nThe data in Table 2 show that the two paper substrates have distinct roughness on \ntheir sides with Rz varying from 0.70 to 4.40 \uf06dm.  The 3 polyester substrates have on \nthe other hand much lower roughness ranging in Rz from 0.19 to 1.92 \uf06dm.  If we \nassume that Rz < 1 \uf06dm and  Rz > 1 \uf06dm distinguishes between smooth and rough \nsubstrates, we have thus a full combination to assess from, i.e. distinguish between the \nrough and the smooth and various levels of roughness. It is important to note that a-\npriori  these  experiments  can  only  distinguish  the  effect  of  roughness  for  a  given \nmaterial,  i.e  we  should  not  expect  that  for  equal  roughness,  a  paper  surface  will \nexhibit the same Vae as a polyester substrate.  Our experiments with these two very \ndifferent materials (and the two materials mostly used as substrates in the coating \nindustry) are therefore very useful in assessing this effect.   7 \nNow, another method of characterising the substrates - that of measuring the dynamic \ncontact angle of a drop of the fluid tested on the substrate utilised - was used in this \nstudy.  This method captures topographic effect as well as material effect.  In fact, it is \na measure of the surface energy of these substrates.  We used for this purpose an FTA \n188 video tensiometer which delivers a drop onto a surface and via camera connected \nto  a  computer  enables  to  track  the  change  of the contact  angle with  time until  it \nreaches its equilibrium value. Table 2 gives values of the contact angle at t = 0 s and t \n= 3  s  for the substrates tested to  highlight  this  characteristic.   Figure  3 gives the \ncomplete variation in time of the contact angle for the various liquid-substrate system \ntested  in  the  coating  trials.This  surface energy technique is  particularly discerning \nwhen effects other than roughness are sought and is useful for assessing substrates of \nsimilar roughness or similar equilibrium contact angle.   \n \nThe Measurement of Vae: The air entrainment speed was measured by illuminating the \nwetting line area through the chamber windows, increasing slowly the substrate speed \nand measuring either the speed at which the dynamic wetting line breaks into \u201cvvv\u201d \nsegments  if these appeared or the speed at which we could see air bubbles being \nentrained in the flow.  Remember that under atmospheric conditions, we know that \nwhen the dynamic wetting line breaks into \u201cvvv\u201d segments, air bubbles form at the tip \nof the segment and are entrained into the liquid.  The observations were carried out \nvisually when large \u201cvvv\u201d were formed or with the aid of a colour CCD camera with \nmagnification  up  to  33  times  and  a  long  distance  microscope  linked  to  an  image \ndisplay-recording system.  In order to reduce experimental errors, each data point was \nrepeated at least five times. The relative standard deviation was always found to be \nlower than 3.5%, being even less than 2% in most cases. All coating experiments were \nconducted at room temperature (between 20 and 27 \u00b0C), and the actual temperature of \nthe liquid, Texp, was carefully recorded, for the purpose of measuring the physical \nproperties of the coating liquid. \n \nFurther  details  on  the  experimental  method  as  well  as  a  presentation  of  all  data \npertaining to this study  can be found in Khan (2006). \n \n3.   RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \n3.1. Validation of the Experimental Technique \nIn  order  to  validate  the  experimental  technique,  Vae  was  measured at  atmospheric \npressure using the smooth polyester substrates and glycerine-water solutions.  These \nare the conditions used by most previous researchers including Burley and Kennedy \n(1976), Gutoff and Kendrick (1982), Burley and Jolly (1984), Cohu and Benkreira \n(1998) and Blake and Shikhmurzaev (2002).  The comparisons between our measured \nVae and those measured by these workers are presented in Fig. 4.  There is a good \nagreement between all the data but particularly very good agreement with the data of \nCohu  and  Benkreira  (1998)  and  Blake  and  Shikhmurzaev  (2002)  who  all  used \nphotographic  type  support  substrates  similar  to  ours.  Figure  4  also  includes  the \nexperimental correlation of Gutoff and Kendrick\u2019s (1982) obtained with a series of \nfluids.    The  very  good  agreement  confirms  the  primary  effect  of  viscosity  on  air \nentrainment speeds.  Figure 4 shows also Vae we measured on the same substrates \nwith silicone oils which have a much lower surface tensions (20 as against 65 mN\/m \nfor glycerine solutions).  In comparison, Vae measured with silicone oils is lower than   8 \nthat measured with  glycerol solutions, particularly at lower viscosities.  The same \nobservation on the effect of surface tension has been made by Burley and Kennedy \n(1976),  Burley  and  Jolly  (1984)  and  Cohu  and  Benkreira  (1998)  and  confirm  the \naccuracy of our experimental technique.   \n \n3.2  Effect of Vacuum Pressures on Smooth Substrates \nHere the substrates considered are one side of one paper (Pap1B) and both sides of the \ntwo polyester Plast2 and Plast3 or 5 substrates altogether all of roughness Rz<1 \uf06dm as \nindicated  in  Table  2.    These  substrates  were  tested  over  a  range  of  silicone  oils \nviscosities and the observations were as follows. \n \n\uf0a7  In all cases and with all the pressures tested down to 20 mbar, dynamic wetting \nfailure manifested itself with the appearance of the \u201cvvv line\u201d.  In other words \nthe nature of the dynamic wetting failure remains the same as we decrease \npressure.  \n\uf0a7  Typically, with  our substrate of 60 mm width, there were about 10 \u201cv\u201d at \natmospheric pressure with the 200 mPa.s viscosity silicone oil.  With the 20 \nmPa.s, there were only 2 \u201cv\u201d at atmospheric conditions.  Similar observations \nhave  been  reported  at  atmospheric  conditions  by  Burley  (1992).  Figure  5 \nshows 1 large \u201cv\u201d extending some 5 cm from the liquid surface all the way \nthrough the rubber slit at the bottom of the tank with the glycerol solution of \nviscosity 40 mPa.s at atmospheric pressure.  \n\uf0a7  Generally, the size of the \u201cv\u201d decreased  and their number increased (becoming \nsmaller and difficult to see) with decreasing pressure at a constant viscosity. \nClearly, when the pressure is reduced drastically away from atmospheric, the \npropensity of the substrate to entrain air is being diminished. \n\uf0a7  With all the four silicone oils and the two smooth polyester substrates tested, \nthe air entrainment speeds measured at constant viscosity were found to be \nalmost identical (+\/-3.5%) on both sides of these substrates. Figure 6a gives \ndata for Plast2F\/B for four viscosity values.  In order not to cluter Fig. 6a, only \nPlast3F  is  added  to  the  figure  which  shows  clearly  the  polyester  substrate \nperforming almost identically front and back over the range of viscosities and \npressures tested.  These results in the measured Vae reinforce the accuracy of \nour technique since these substrates are smooth on both sides. \n\uf0a7  The air entrainment data presented in Fig. 6a show that at constant viscosity, \nVae does not vary very much when the air pressure was reduced from 1 bar to \n500 mbar but a sharp increase was measured at pressures below 200 mbar with \nmore  than  a  doubling  of  Vae  when  the  pressure  is  reduced  to  20  mbar. \nTypically the air entrainment speed at atmospheric conditions was 0.4 m\/s with \n20 mPa.s liquid and increased to 0.83 m\/s at 20 mbar.   \n\uf0a7  Another important observation from the data shown in Fig. 6b (taken as Fig. \n6a for Plast2 over the low pressure range) is the cross over or \u201cswitch\u201d of the \nconstant viscosity data.  This leads to a low viscosity fluid entraining air at a \nspeed  lower  than  a  high  viscosity  fluid  which  is  the  opposite  of  what  is \nobserved at atmospheric pressure.  The switch pressures for 200-100, 100-50 \nand 50-20 mPa.s are 135, 80 and 30 mbar respectively.  The implication in \npractice is that the \u201cswitch\u201d or the steep increase in air entrainment speed with \nreduced pressure is occurring at lower pressure with high viscosity fluids.  In \nother  words,  the  speed  of  coating  with  high  viscosity  liquids-a  desirable   9 \ncondition- can be increased without going down to a large vacuum.  We infer \nfrom the data of Fig. 6a that for a 500 mPa.s solution, the switch will occur in \nthe region of 200 mbar, a vacuum not difficult to achieve.  \n\uf0a7  Experiments below 20 mbars proved very difficult as the air entrainment speed \nincreased sharply and the physical restriction of the rig could not accommodate \nlarge  reels  of  substrate.    Although,  it  would  be  desirable  to  carry  on \nexperiments  below  20  mbar  to  test  the  extent  of  the  effect  of  reduced  air \npressure on air entrainment speeds, the observations below 500 mbars down to \n20 mbar are unequivocal: the surrounding hydrodynamic air conditions affect \nair  entrainment  and  as  the  pressure  is  reduced  below  50  mbar  when  the \nviscosity of the air start to reduce significantly, Vae shoots up, suggesting it will \napproaches a very high value (infinity?) at zero viscosity. This is the most \nimportant result of this study and probably of all experimental studies to date \non the fundamental role of the surrounding air viscosity on dynamic wetting. \n \n3.3 Effect of Vacuum Pressures on Rough Substrates \nHere we tested three substrates, two of which were paper with increasing roughness \nand one polyester substrate (Plast1) of roughness similar to the least rough paper.    \nThe way in which the dynamic wetting line broke was the same as with the smooth \nsubstrates discussed above except that the \u201cv\u201d were smaller and there were many more \nat comparatively equal viscosities and pressures.  As for the air entrainment speed, the \nresults were similar to those obtained with smooth substrates: Vae essentially did not \nchange between 1 bar and 500 mbars but below 500 mbars and more particularly \nbelow 50 mbars, further reductions in pressures increased Vae very sharply suggesting \nagain  that  at  zero  pressure  or  zero  viscosity  Vae  would  attain  a  very  large  value \n(infinity?). There are however subtle changes in behaviour and it is useful to consider \nthe polyester and paper substrate separately. \n \nPolyester Substrate (Plast1):  Both sides of this substrate have marginally different \nroughness (Rz = 1.92 \uf06dm for the front and 1.71 \uf06dm for the back) and marginally \ndifferent initial static contact angle (65\n0 for the front and 57\n0 for the back) and are \nexpected to display similar Vae at fixed viscosity and pressure.  The data in Fig. 7 \nshow that this is the case until we get to a viscosity of 200 mPa.s and a vacuum \npressure of 180 mbar when the front and back behaviours diverge significantly with \nreduced  pressure.    Specifically,  at  200  mPa.s  and  80  mbar,  the  back  side  of  this \nsubstrate entrained air at coating speed of 0.33 m\/s whereas the front side still coated \nair free when the coating speed was more than double.  Note that all the experiments \nin our programme were repeated several times, this particular set of experiment was \nrepeated about five times and showed consistently this behaviour.  Clearly substrate \neffects are important- here measured via roughness and initial static contact angle- and \na  switch  has  occurred  with  this  substrates  at  200  mPa.s  and 180 mbars.   Similar \nsubstrate  effects  have  been  reported  by  Benkreira  (2004)  at  atmospheric  pressure, \nexcept that here the reduced pressure increases drastically the air entrainment speed.  \nThe implication in practice is that when coating high viscosity liquids one may assume \nwe are limited in coating speed.  We have shown here, that with the correct substrate, \na small reduction in operating pressure can lead to high air-free coating speeds.  How \nto define a correct substrate for that purpose, we cannot do at present except to relate \nit  in  our  case  to  the  measured  roughness  and  initial  contact  angle  (see  Table  2).  \nHowever, given a substrate, we have shown that through experiments, we can obtain a   10 \nswitch  condition.    Figure  8  which  compares  the  smooth  polyester  with  the  rough \npolyester illustrates clearly the points made and shows one coating at coating speeds \nmore than twice the other at identical operating conditions.  These results are clearly \nimportant  in  practice  as  they  indicate  that  with  moderate  decrease  in  pressure, \nsubstrates  may  \u201coutperform\u201d  expectation  as  viscosity  is  increased.  There  may  of \ncourse be no switch but it is important in practice to test the limits of operation by \ninvestigating the \u201ccoatability\u201d of a particular substrate at increased viscosity whilst \ninvestigating the effect of reduced pressure.   \n \nPaper Substrates: The data for these two substrates are now presented and the results \nare shown in Fig. 9a, b for all viscosities and pressures tested down to the lowest \nvacuum.  The roughness and contact angles of each of the sides of these substrates are \ngiven in Table 2. We note, as observed with smooth substrates,  that the effect of \npressure on Vae become significant only when the pressure is reduced below a low \nlimit, typically less than 100 mbar.  Figure 9a displays for each viscosity one pair of \nlines for roughness front\/back 4.40 \uf06dm \/0.70 \uf06dm showing the variation of Vae with \npressure. At low viscosity, the smooth side exhibits higher Vae than the rough side.  \nThe difference in Vae in each pair reduces as we increase viscosity until we get to a \ncritical viscosity when the pair of lines coincide and both sides exhibit similar Vae at a \ngiven pressure.  Above the critical viscosity the sides \u201cswitch\u201d, i.e. the rough side \nexhibits  higher  Vae  than  the  smooth  side.  Such  a  switch  has  been  observed  by \nBenkreira  (2004)  for  dip  coating  at  atmospheric  pressure  and  the  data  here  at \natmospheric  pressure  confirm  the  earlier  findings  that  roughness  can  increase  or \ndecrease Vae depending on the value of viscosity.  The added observation in this data \nis that the switch, coupled with the increase in Vae with reduced pressure, gives an \nopportunity to coat high viscosity coatings (high solid content) at much higher speed \nthan expected.  For example,  at  atmospheric pressure, we could coat a 145 mPas \nsolution  at  speed  equivalent  to  coating  an  85  mPa.s  solution  by  changing  the \nroughness from 0.70 \uf06dm to 4.40 \uf06dm. At pressure of 100 mbar, we can coat the same \n145 mPa.s solution  at speed equivalent to the 52 mPa.s or less solution by changing \nthe roughness from 0.70 \uf06dm to 4.40 \uf06dm.  Much higher speeds can be attained by \nlowering the pressure further.  This observation is very useful in practice as it implies \nthat  if  one  chooses  carefully  roughness,  one  can  coat  viscous  formulation  at \nunexpectedly  very  high  speeds  with  a  moderate  vacuum.  The  data  in  Fig.  9  b \nconfirms these findings and show that for this particular pair of roughness (1.93 \uf06dm\/ \n3.78 \uf06dm), the switch occurs at much lower viscosity 18 mPa.s.   \n \n \n4. CONCLUSIONS \n \nThis work has established for the first time the effect of air pressure (viscosity) on air \nentrainment speeds in coating flows using dip coating as the model flow.  Although, \nexperiments could not be realised at the desired 1 mbar values because of the physical \ndimensions of the vacuum chamber (large reel of substrate are needed because of the \nhigh air entrainment speed), the result is unequivocal about the pronounced effect of \nair pressures when these are reduced below 100 mbars.  Air hydrodynamics do have \nan effect on its entrainment and, with the same coating liquid on the same substrate, \nmore  than  double  the  air  entrainment  speed  when  the  pressure  is  reduced  from \natmospheric to 50 mbars.  The data presented in this work also confirm the complex   11 \nrole  of  roughness,  in  that  it  can  increase  or  decrease  the  air  entrainment  speed \ndepending on the value on the viscosity of the coating solution.  This observation is \nvery useful in practice as it implies that if one chooses carefully roughness one can \ncoat viscous formulation at unexpectedly very high speeds with a moderate vacuum.  \nThe  observations  that  Vae  is  sensitive  to  both  roughness  and  air  pressure  (at  low \npressures) suggest that hydrodynamic effects play a very important role in dynamic \nwetting- a result we already know when we consider curtain coating (Blake, Clarke \nand Ruschak, 1994).  In these experiments, we \u201cdeveloped\u201d hydrodynamic effects by \nmanipulating  the  substrate  roughness  and  the  conditions  of  the  surrounding  air \nwhereas in curtain coating, the effects were developed by manipulating the flow of the \nliquid on the substrate. \nHaving now settled the question of the active role of air and hydrodynamics in \ndynamic  wetting,  we  need  to  develop  further  insight  of  this  important  effect  by \nmeasuring \uf046, the angle of inclination of the \u201cv\u201d segments, a measure of the maximum \nspeed of wetting and the contact angle \uf071D under reduced pressures.  Experiments with \nother gases are also necessary.  Such data can then be used to test newly emerging \ntheories on dynamic wetting. \n \n \n6.
