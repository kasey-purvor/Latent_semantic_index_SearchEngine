Introduction\nThe discussion concerning the application of WTO law in the Community legal\norder is not new. While the importance of the issue is undoubted, academic\ncomment has largely focused on the judicial treatment afforded by the Court of\nJustice towards WTO law, and neglected the multifarious aspects of its application\nby the Union institutions.1 This article aims to fill the vacuum by engaging the\nCommunity\u2019s political institutions alongside the Court of Justice and scrutinizing\nthe interaction between the judiciary and the legislature. It thereby aims to\nbetter comprehend the broader ramifications of WTO law in the Community legal\norder.\nIn order to achieve its aims, the present analysis will cut across institutional\npractice, draw the commonalities between the different approaches of the\n* I am grateful to Tony Arnull, Roy Davis, Robert Schu\u00a8tze, Colin Warbrick, Marc Be\u00b4nitah, Stijn Billiet,\nRafael Leal-Arcas, the anonymous referees and the members of the editorial board of World Trade Review\nfor their comments.

The Court of Justice\u2019s\napproach will remain the focus of attention and will form the starting point of the\ndiscussion. It is well established that the Court of Justice has, in principle, denied\nthe direct effect of WTO law in the Community and Member States\u2019 legal orders.\nThis approach is best described by the term reactive. The Court, however, has not\nalways maintained such an approach and, in certain circumstances, has submitted\nthe Community to the normative control of WTO law. This alternative approach,\nwhich is complemented by legislative initiatives taken by the Community\u2019s politi-\ncal institutions, shall be called coactive. The main locus of the third, or proactive,\napproach can be found in the activity of the political institutions and the fact that\nWTO law has acquired a central role in the shaping of the Union\u2019s internal and\nexternal policies. The critical examination of the political and legal considerations\nshaping this categorization will follow, while the impact of the interaction between\nthe legislature and the judiciary will be reviewed.\n2. Reactive approach\nThe Court of Justice\nIntroducing the concept of direct effect\nThe question of direct effect of WTO law forms part of the more general debate of\nthe reception of general international law in the Community legal order.2 From an\ninternational law point of view, it is clear that international law will prevail in the\ncase of conflict with domestic law.3 However, the determination of whether a\ncertain provision is directly effective is a matter for domestic law, unless, of course,\nthe parties to an international agreement have agreed to make its provisions di-\nrectly effective.4 Domestic law will also determine the conditions under which a\nprovision of international law can be directly effective.\nClearly not an invention of the Court of Justice, the definition of direct effect\nis not without controversy. As a preliminary issue, it should be mentioned that\ndirect effect has appeared in international law under several headings ranging\nfrom direct applicability and self-executing provisions to direct effect.5 In some\nof the original Community Member States, belonging predominantly to the\nmonist legal tradition, international treaties were intended to confer rights on\n2 J.

Schrauwen (eds.), Direct Effect: Rethinking a Classic of EC Legal Doctrine\n(Europa Law, 2002).\n3 Article 27 of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.\n4 Jan Klabbers, \u2018 International Law in Community Law: The Law and Politics of Direct Effect\u2019 (2002)\n21 Yearbook of European Law 263; Thomas Cottier, \u2018A Theory of Direct Effect in Global Law\u2019 in A.

By holding in Van Gend en Loos10 that the Community is a special case\nand that the determination of whether Community law can be directly effective\nderives from Community law itself,11 the Court recognized the right-conferring\nqualities of Community norms in the \u2018new legal order\u2019 as a result of which rights\nwere conferred upon individuals that national courts were bound to protect. The\nreference to Van Gend en Loos, while seemingly of limited input to the under-\nstanding of the concept of direct effect of international\/WTO law in the\nCommunity and Member States legal orders, is, it is argued here, of cardinal im-\nportance to understand the indoctrination of academic comment by a commu-\nnitarized understanding of the concept.12\nGenerally speaking, several arguments have been brought forward in an attempt\nto classify the Community legal order as monist or dualist following the traditional\ndistinction in international law.13 The Court stated in Haegeman that an inter-\nnational agreement is an act of the institutions and that the provisions of such an\nagreement form an integral part of the Community legal order.14 Immediately re-\nceived as a confession of monism, it was explained in Kupferberg15 that the\nmeaning attached to the \u2018integral part of the Community legal order\u2019 proviso was\nthat the Member States had not only assumed a responsibility for the fulfilment of\n6 E.

The Court\nadded that the nature and structure of an international agreement may prevent an\nindividual from invoking its provisions before a court in the Community.16 If this\nhurdle is overcome, international law provisions are required to be unconditional\nand sufficiently precise in the context of the agreement they form part of.17\nDespite the criticism that the criterion concerning the nature and structure of the\nagreement received from commentators in the early stages,18 the Court has been\nconsistent in this requirement.19 The two fundamental cases of International Fruit\n(GATT era) and Portuguese textiles (WTO era) will serve to illustrate the Court\u2019s\nunderstanding of the WTO Agreement\u2019s nature and purpose.\nThe GATT crops: from International Fruit to Bananas\nThe Court was faced with the GATT for a first time in International Fruit in the\ncourse of a preliminary ruling on validity.20 It opined that the Community, not a\nGATT Contracting Party, was bound by the GATT Agreement;21 the Court\u2019s own\njurisdiction, however, depended on whether the GATT provisions were capable of\nconferring rights on individuals.22 The Court then found that owing to the great\nflexibility of the GATT provisions, and, in particular, those conferring the possi-\nbility of derogation, including taking safeguard measures when confronted with\nexceptional difficulties, and the inadequacy of the provisions for the settlement of\nthe disputes between the Contracting Parties, individuals could not invoke GATT\nprovisions before national courts.23 Accordingly, because of lack of direct effect,\nthe Court was unable to examine the validity of the regulations. The Court\nmaintained its position in subsequent rulings and, despite criticism,24 extended its\nfindings to preliminary rulings on interpretation.25\n16 Kupferberg at paras. 10\u201322.\n17 Kupferberg at para. 23.\n18 Henry G.

Viewed\nagainst the backdrop of qualified majority voting in the Council in the field of\nthe common commercial policy and taking into account that no individual\nrights were involved, this appeared to raise a strong claim before the Court.\nThe Court of Justice did not entertain this claim. In the first Bananas judgment, it\nheld that:\nthose features of the GATT, from which the Court concluded that an individual\nwithin the Community cannot invoke it in a court to challenge the lawfulness of a\nCommunity act, also preclude the Court from taking provisions of GATT into\nconsideration to assess the lawfulness of a regulation in an action brought by a\nMember State under the first paragraph of Article 173 of the Treaty.26\nIn sum, individuals may not invoke GATT law in national courts, even more so\nwhen such legislation is invoked in order to challenge Community law. Neither\ncan Member States and Community institutions invoke GATT law to challenge\nCommunity law.27 The Court\u2019s thesis, as interpreted at the time in the light of\nInternational Fruit, meant that because the provisions of the GATT do not have\ndirect effect, they cannot serve as a criterion for legality. With the benefit of\nhindsight, it can be argued here28 that the Court meant that the same defining\nfeatures of the GATT preclude its provisions from both being invoked by in-\ndividuals in national or Community courts and serving as a standard for the review\nof legality of secondary Community law.\nThe WTO advent with Portuguese Textiles\nAfter the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations,\nwhich led to the transformation of the GATT into the WTO, questions concerning\nthe direct effect of WTO law in the Community legal order started inundating the\nCourt in the form of requests for preliminary rulings made by national courts.29 In\n26 Case C-280\/93 Germany v.

When Portugal brought an action for the annulment of Council\nDecision 96\/386,33 alleging that it violated certain provisions of the GATT, the\nAgreement on Textiles and Clothing, the Agreement on Import Licensing and gen-\neral principles of Community law,34 the Court was presented with a prime oppor-\ntunity for a definitive resolution of the matter in the light of the new developments.\nAG Saggio suggested a change in policy. In his Opinion, after a brief overview of\nthe WTO agreements relevant to the dispute, the Court\u2019s case law regarding in-\nternational agreements, generally, and the GATT, in particular, the AG held that\nonly GATT rules must be found directly effective before the legality of Community\nacts can be tested against their provisions.35 Faced with the eleventh recital of the\npreamble to the Council Decision concluding the WTOAgreement, which declares\nthat the Agreement and its annexes are not susceptible to direct invocation in\nCommunity or Member States\u2019 courts, the AG, in the light of the relevant pro-\nvisions of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties and the Opinion of\nAdvocate General Tesauro in Herme`s,36 dismissed its importance as nothing more\nthan a policy statement which cannot affect the jurisdiction of either the\nCommunity or national courts to interpret and apply the rules contained in the\nWTO agreements.37 Consequently, he went on to analyse the novel characteristics\nof the WTO system, including the new system for the settlement of disputes, and\nargued that the inclusion of a system for the settlement of disputes within the\nWTO does not usurp the Court of Justice\u2019s jurisdiction to interpret and apply\nWTO rules and to annul or sanction any internal measures which might be\ncontrary to those rules.38 The final hurdle, the issue of reciprocity, raised by the\n30 Case C-53\/96Herme`s International v.

If WTO law is found to be\nin conflict with primary Community legislation, the latter should be upheld despite\nthe risk of the Community suffering international responsibility.40\nIn its judgment, the Court held that:\nhaving regard to their nature and structure, the WTO agreements are not in\nprinciple among the rules in the light of which the Court is to review the legality\nof measures adopted by the Community institutions.41\nThis statement is foundational of the jurisprudence constante42 of the Court of\nJustice denying GATT\/WTO law direct effect. Terminologically, it maintained\nthe broad scope of the concept \u2018direct effect \u2019 to include the effect of WTO law as\na standard of review.43 In order to arrive at this conclusion, the Court started\nwith the statement from Kupferberg that the parties to an agreement have the\npower to determine the effect of the agreement and the means for its implemen-\ntation within the parties \u2019 legal orders; in the absence of an agreement thereon, it is\nup to the Court to rule on the matter.44 The Court then juxtaposed the system\nestablished under the WTO Agreement with the GATT and declared that,\nalthough the former differs significantly from the provisions of GATT 1947, it still\naccords considerable importance to the negotiation between the parties.45 This is\nproven by the fact that, while under Article 3.7 DSU measures found inconsistent\nwith the agreement should be withdrawn, there is a possibility for compensation\nand, should this be declined, retaliation against the party whose legislation was\nfound to be inconsistent with the WTO Agreement.46 The Court then laid down\nthe two basic considerations for the denial of direct effect, namely the lack of\n39 Enshrined in Article 60 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties and meaning that the\nfailure of one party to observe its obligations under an agreement does not justify the other parties from\napplying the agreement among themselves.\n40 AG Saggio Opinion in Case C-149\/96 Portugal v.

Council supra note 34 at paras. 36\u201339.\nThe European Union and WTO law 51\nreciprocity,47 and the freedom of the political institutions.48 The basic argument\nbehind the principle of reciprocity is that the most important commercial partners\nof the Community do not allow their domestic courts to review the legality of their\nlegislation against WTO law. It distinguished Kupferberg where the principle of\nreciprocity was dismissed on the premise that, while the WTO system is based on\nreciprocal and mutually advantageous arrangements, the EEC\u2013Portugal FTA\nintroduced a certain asymmetry of obligations.49 It further held that the grant of\ndirect effect would lead to disuniform application of WTO rules in the different\nWTO Members.50 In addition, the freedom of political institutions would be\nusurped should the obligation of the Community to comply with theWTO rules be\ndevolved to the judiciary.51 The Court finally held that such an interpretation is\nconsonant with the Council\u2019s view enshrined in the last recital of Council Decision\n94\/800.52\nThe principle of reciprocity. With regard to the principle of reciprocity, the\nCourt essentially held that since the major trading partners of the Community\ndo not grant direct effect to WTO law, in the interests of the principle of\nreciprocity, the Court of Justice was precluded from doing so.53 This was the\nfirst time that the Court had resort to the lack of reciprocity in order to deny\ngranting direct effect to the provisions of an international agreement. Until\nthat time, the Court referred to the principle in a dismissive manner.54 For in-\nstance, in Bresciani, a case concerning the interpretation of the Yaounde\u00b4\nConvention, the Court introduced the principle only to explain that in the cir-\ncumstances governing the Yaounde\u00b4 Convention strict reciprocity should not\napply, because of the Community\u2019s intention to assist the development of the\nassociated countries by granting privileges to them.55 Accordingly, the rights\nthat the nationals of the parties to the Yaounde\u00b4 Convention could invoke in\nMember States\u2019 courts were not conditional on reciprocal treatment of\nCommunity citizens in these countries. By juxtaposing these cases with Portugal\nv. Council, it may be assumed that the principle of reciprocity constitutes a valid\njustification for the denial of direct effect in relations between equals and is\nnot prone to being invoked in international agreements establishing asymmetric\nrelations.\n47 Portugal v.

This\nwas mainly a response to the AG Trabucchi\u2019s argumentation on the lack of direct effect.\n52 ANTON I S ANTON IAD I S\nThe central position of reciprocity in the Court\u2019s denial of direct effect in\nPortugal v. Council has not been treated favourably by commentators.56 Eeckhout\npointed out that there are certain inherent asymmetries within the WTO system as\nwell, citing the examples of the Community as a Customs Union and the prefer-\nential treatment of developing countries within the WTO system.57 Given that it is\nnot difficult to justify the Court\u2019s position from a pragmatic perspective \u2013 the\nCommunity would find itself in a particularly disadvantageous position compared\nwith the USA and Japan \u2013 the question is whether the Court\u2019s position is defensible\nalso from a doctrinal perspective. The asymmetry in the Community\u2019s bilateral\nagreements features as an essential element of the design of those agreements. It\nexpresses the Community\u2019s decision to grant rights under the agreement to third,\nusually less developed, countries thereby encouraging trade and the integration of\nthose countries into the multilateral trading system. In most cases, the substance of\nthe provisions contained in these agreements replicated those of Community law.58\nBy contrast, the rights and obligations the Community and its Member States\nassumed when founding the WTO constitute a delicate balance, the result of mu-\ntually satisfactory concessions arrived at after eight years of negotiations.\nAsymmetric application thereof would disturb that balance and undermine the\nagreement struck. Accordingly, it was established by the Court in Portugal\nv. Council,59 and later clarified in Van Parys,60 that it is in the interest of the\nappropriate interpretation and application of WTO law that the Court makes the\ngrant of direct effect to WTO law subject to the principle of reciprocity.61\nThe freedom of political institutions. It was established in Portugal v. Council\nthat the grant of direct effect would compromise the freedom of the\nCommunity\u2019s political institutions within the WTO system. There are two as-\npects of the freedom of the political institutions: first, the external aspect, where\nthe grant of direct effect is destined to weaken the negotiating strength of the in-\nstitutions within the WTO in relation to the most important trading partners\nand, second, the internal aspect, the shift of the institutional balance in external\ntrade matters from the Council and the Commission to the Court. The grant of\ndirect effect would have the consequence that any Community legislative\nmeasure could be challenged before the Court of Justice as WTO incompatible.\n56 Inter alia, Stefan Griller, \u2018Judicial Enforceability of WTO Law in the European Union: Annotation\nto Case C-149\/96, Portugal v.

The impact of\npreliminary references on validity under Article 234 EC will be more significant as\nit can be expected that national courts will seek guidance on questions of WTO\nlaw, the specialized and complex nature of which is unlikely to encourage them to\ntackle them themselves. Direct challenges brought by Member States, on the other\nhand, are likely to increase because of EU enlargement. Under the Treaty of Nice\nrules on qualified majority voting, as many as 12Member States could form a non-\nblocking minority against WTO-related acts adopted ultimately by the Council.63\nThis makes increased litigation probable with national governments, under\npressure from powerful economic and political lobbies and NGOs, forced to bring\nannulment proceedings against potentially WTO-inconsistent acts which they\nfailed to block in the Council.\nThe freedom of political institutions should also be examined within the\nWTO context. There is no better example to illustrate the considerations at issue\nthan the EC\u2013Bananas dispute. This dispute, concerning the inconsistency with\nWTO rules of the Common Market Organization (CMO) in bananas, ran in\nparallel in the WTO dispute settlement system and the Court of Justice.64 The\nCMO in bananas, as amended, contained a complex system of quotas and\nimport licensing procedures favouring traditional and ACP importers of bananas\nand has been long viewed as an important development tool. It was unavoidable\nthat, but for the lack of direct effect, one of the several challenges brought\nagainst the CMO in Community courts would have succeeded and the\nCommunity would have been divested of the possibility of applying for a\npreferential regime on imports from ACP countries, a practice which is central\nto the Community\u2019s development policy. Assuming that the Community\npurports to apply WTO-consistent policies, this is not, in principle, undesirable.\nHowever, at the same time, the Community would have forfeited the facility\nto obtain a waiver, a route it actually followed in EC\u2013Bananas.65 Giving\naway such an important WTO-legitimate option is like shooting oneself in\nthe foot. Unlike the argument in Kupferberg where the Court dismissed the\nimportance of the safeguard clauses in the FTA with Portugal as being too\n62 Case C-50\/00 P Union de Pequen\u02dcos Agricultores v.

Had the\nCourt granted direct effect to WTO law, the political institutions\u2019 arms would\nhave been tied and their authority to negotiate with other WTO Members would\nhave been frustrated. The side effect this development would have would be to turn\nthe Court of Justice, rather than the WTO dispute settlement system, into the\nprincipal forum where Community legislation would be challenged. This rep-\nresents a disruption not only of the institutional balance between the institutions\nof the Community, but also of the institutional framework established by the\nWTO.67\nDirect effect of Panel and Appellate Body rulings\nThe conclusion to the previous section indicates that the Court of Justice did not\nwish to usurp the function of the WTO bodies to interpret WTO law and review\nthe consistency of Community acts against its provisions. Would the Court of\nJustice be prepared to change its position were it faced with a case where a Panel\nand\/or the Appellate Body ruled that a Community measure violated WTO law\nand consider itself bound by such ruling? The question accordingly is whether,\nfrom a WTO perspective, the Panel and Appellate Body rulings create an obli-\ngation to perform in a traditional international law sense and whether domestic\ncourts are bound by the rulings.68\nBefore answering this question, it would be useful to analyse the nature and legal\nforce of DSB recommendations from a WTO perspective. In Japan\u2013Taxes on\nAlcoholic Beverages, at the examination of the bindingness of adopted GATT\npanel reports, the Appellate Body held:\nAdopted panel reports are an important part of the GATT acquis. They are often\nconsidered by subsequent panels. They create legitimate expectations among\nWTO Members, and, therefore, should be taken into account where they are\nrelevant to any dispute. However, they are not binding, except with respect to\nresolving the particular dispute between the parties to that dispute.69\nAt this stage, it would be useful to briefly note how a dispute is resolved between\nWTOMembers under the Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU). At the finding\nof a violation, the Panel or the Appellate Body shall \u2018recommend that the Member\nconcerned bring the measure into conformity with the agreement \u2019. In the proper\ninterpretation of the DSU terms, compliance with the WTO obligation may be\n66 Case 104\/81 Hauptzollamt Meinz v.

In addition to its recommendations, a Panel or the Appellate\nBody may suggest ways in which the Member concerned could implement the\nrecommendations.71 Panels have been reluctant to recommend specific ways for\nimplementation, thereby showing deference to the national margin of manoeuvre\nat the implementation of their recommendations72 and illustrating the hypothesis\nthat compliance may have several variants.73 Commentators, however, support\nbindingness beyond the traditional sense and militate in favour of the full effect of\nthose rulings in the Community legal order.74 Jackson argues that despite their\nlinguistic shortcomings there are several provisions in the DSU that point towards\nthe direction of bindingness.75 He does however acknowledge that the US Courts\nwill not treat them as such, but indicates that these rulings may affect the US\njurisprudence as well as those of other WTO Members.\nRegarding the Community legal order, the question of the effect of WTO Panel\nand Appellate Body rulings was presented to the Court on several occasions. In the\ncourse of the EC\u2013Bananas litigation, several actions were brought seeking to annul\nthe CMO in bananas or claim damages invoking the relevant DSB recommend-\nations. The initial approach by the Court of First Instance (CFI) avoided the issue\nby narrowing the scope of the Panel and Appellate Body\u2019s findings and declining\nthe review of the entire tariff quota system established by the CMO in bananas.76\nThe Court of Justice later recognized the link between direct effect of WTO pro-\nvisions and the DSB recommendations, by explaining that DSB decisions estab-\nlishing the inconsistency of Community law with the GATT could only have been\ntaken into consideration should the Court have found the GATT to have direct\n70 Jackson, supra note 68.\n71 Article 19.1 DSU.\n72 Allan Rosas, \u2018Implementation and Enforcement of WTO Dispute Settlement Findings: An EU\nPerspective\u2019 (2001) 4 Journal of International Economic Law 131 at p. 134.

As a\nresult, direct effect of DSB recommendations should be excluded.\nThe question which logically follows is whether, where the Community adopts a\nlegislative measure in response to adverse DSB recommendations, it could be\nconstrued as doing so in order to implement a particular WTO obligation, thereby\ntriggering the so-called Nakajima exception, according to which the said legis-\nlation can be reviewed against the WTO provisions it is intended to implement.78\nThe question was initially broached by the CFI in three more \u2018bananas\u2019 cases,\nCordis, Bocchi, and T. Port, in which the applicants requested from the CFI to\nexamine the provisions of Regulation 2362\/98 in the light of the WTO Agreement\nand, in particular, those provisions that the previous Regulation had been found to\nviolate. The CFI declined the application of the implementation exception, de-\nclaring that:\nneither the reports of the WTO Panel of 22May 1997 nor the report of the WTO\nStanding Appellate Body of 9 September 1997 which was adopted by the Dispute\nSettlement Body on 25 September 1997 included any special obligations which\nthe Commission \u2018intended to implement\u2019, within the meaning of the case law, in\nRegulation No 2632\/98.79\nThe judgments attracted criticism as a missed opportunity to extend the im-\nplementation principle to its proper scope.80 It should be counter-argued however\nthat this represents the logical consequence of the denial of direct effect to\nWTO law.\nThe Court revisited the issue in Biret,81 a case concerning the claim for non-\ncontractual liability of the Community for damages suffered by Biret because\nof the Community\u2019s import ban on hormone-treated beef. The DSB had estab-\nlished the inconsistency of the ban with Articles 3.3 and 5.1 of the SPS Agreement82\nand the Court seemed to respond to the calls from academics and indicate its\nreadiness to trigger theNakajima exception. In this judgment, the Court confirmed\nthat the WTO rules are not among those rules in the light of which the Court is to\nreview the legality of measures adopted by the Community institutions subject to a\ntemporal limitation.83 Since the Community had stated that it intended to comply\n77 Case C-104\/97P Atlanta v.

In fact, the CFI in Chiquita,86 following the signal given by the Court in\nBiret, accepted, in principle, the assumption that, in amending the CMO in\nbananas the Community intended to implement the substantive GATT and GATS\nobligations it was found to violate.87\nThe Van Parys judgment, delivered by the Court of Justice one month after the\nCFI made its pronouncements in Chiquita, put an end to theoretical discussions on\nthe scope of the Nakajima exception that would afford direct effect to DSB rec-\nommendations in the Community legal order.88 The question presented to the\nCourt in Van Parys was whether the WTO agreements give Community nationals\na right to rely on WTO agreements in legal proceedings challenging the validity of\nCommunity legislation, where the DSB has held that both that legislation and\nsubsequent legislation adopted by the Community in order, inter alia, to comply\nwith the relevant WTO rules, are incompatible with those rules.89 The Court an-\nswered the question in the negative. Faithful to its analysis in Portuguese Textiles,\nanalyzed above, it laid down the three basic reasons denying direct effect : first, the\nfreedom of the institutions to reach a mutually acceptable solution;90 second, the\nprinciple of reciprocity;91 third, the nature of the rules enshrined in the WTO\ndispute settlement system. The third reason is of particular importance for its self-\nstanding merit and because it informs the first two and provides an additional layer\nof understanding of the principles analysed above.92 Using the paradigm of the\nCommunity\u2019s bananas regime and the forthcoming resolution of the dispute to\nthe satisfaction of the Community, the Court undertook an overview of the dispute\nand implicitly congratulated the legislature for managing to reconcile the\n84 Biret at paras. 61\u201362.\n85 Jochem Wiers, \u2018One Day, You\u2019re Gonna Pay: The European Court of Justice in Biret \u2019 (2004) 31\nLegal Issues of Economic Integration 143 at p. 147.\n86 Case T-19\/01 Chiquita Brands International, Inc., Chiquita Banana Co.

It simply held that the measures taken by the Community\ninstitutions cannot be interpreted as measures intended to ensure the enforcement\nof a particular obligation within the context of the WTO.98 Implementation\/\ntransposition of the WTO Agreements as such should be resorted to after close\nexamination of all legal, political, and economic considerations. As such, the im-\nplementation exception should remain narrow. The finding by a Panel or the\nAppellate Body that a given Community act is inconsistent with the WTO\nAgreement creates an obligation which is little different to the obligations of the\nWTO Members under the provisions of those agreements and, in particular,\nArticle XVI:4 of the WTO Agreement.99 This general obligation, if taken literally,\nwould mean that all measures taken by WTOMembers falling within the scope of\nthe WTO and covered agreements should be treated as aiming at the implemen-\ntation of those agreements. While this idea might sound attractive to some, such a\nfinding would overrule the Court\u2019s general position concerning direct effect of the\nWTO Agreement, and, should the Court wish to maintain consistency in this re-\nspect, it must be resisted.\nIn lieu of a coda to this analysis, it must be pointed out that the Panel and\nAppellate Body interpretations have developed an increasing significance at the\nresolution of disputes in Community Courts.

There must\nbe an unlawful act imputable to the Community, damage to the applicant, and the\nexistence of a causal link between the unlawful act and the damage suffered.102 It is\nsettled case law that, for the unlawful conduct condition, a sufficiently serious\nbreach of a rule of law intended to confer rights on individuals must be estab-\nlished.103 It is therefore obvious that the question of Community liability is inex-\ntricably linked with the issue of direct effect. In the absence of direct effect, the\nCommunity courts have consistently denied any right to damages,104 as for the\nCommunity to incur liability all conditions must be met.105\nIt has been suggested, making the analogy with Francovich, that direct effect is\nnot necessary for the award of damages.106 This argument can be sourced to the\ndefinition of direct effect and the attempt to treat direct effect and the creation of\nrights for individuals as non-synonymous concepts,107 thereby overlooking the\ndefining characteristic of directives which are, in principle, capable of conferring\nrights on individuals. Those rights can simply not be enforced against other in-\ndividuals in national courts because of the absence of horizontal effect of direc-\ntives.108 In Francovich, because the directives at issue were capable of granting\nrights to individuals and the remaining conditions were fulfilled, damages\nwere awarded. By contrast, the Court\u2019s decision to deny liability to the affected\ntraders for damages suffered in violation of WTO law makes perfect sense. The\n101 Case C-245\/02Anheuser-Busch Inc. v.

In this well-known judg-\nment, the Court opined that a review of legality of Community law cannot be\nundertaken in the context of an action for damages under Article 235 EC while the\ndeadline for compliance with the DSB recommendations under Article 21.3 had\nnot yet expired.111 The unavailability of a damages claim against the Community in\nCommunity Courts was extended by the CFI in Chiquita until the end of the\ndispute in the WTO, particularly so, when the Community was subject to retali-\nation under Article 22 DSU.112 Linked with the preceding analysis on the effect of\nPanel and Appellate Body rulings, these two judgments read together\nmeant \u2013 Chiquita more explicitly so \u2013 that when the Community adopted legis-\nlation so as to comply with adverse DSB recommendations, the affected private\nparties could claim compensation for damages suffered as a result of the measure\nat issue subject to the proceeding under WTO dispute settlement having been\nterminated. This proposition is based on the theoretical assumption that the im-\nplementation exception can apply when the WTO has ruled on the matter.\nFollowing Van Parys, which explained that when the Community amends its\nlegislation in order to comply with adverse DSB recommendations it cannot be\npresumed to intend to implement any particular obligation under the WTO\nAgreements, the foundation of this reasoning is overturned.113 Indeed, since the\nimplementation exception does not apply, the subsequent construction of the\nCommunity Courts in Biret and Chiquita cannot stand.\nThe ruling inVan Parys lessened the anxiety over the long-awaited judgments by\nthe CFI in FIAMM.114 These cases concerned traders who had suffered damages\nnot as a direct result of WTO-incompatible Community legislation but because\nthey were subject to retaliation by another WTO Member. Are those traders en-\ntitled to any compensation? The CFI, based on the previous case law, held that the\nCommunity cannot, in principle, be held liable by reason of any infringement of\n109 For a thoughtful analysis see Armin von Bogdandy, \u2018Legal Effects of World Trade Organization\nDecisions Within European Union Law: A Contribution to the Theory of the Legal Acts of International\nOrganizations and the Action for Damages Under Article 288(2) EC\u2019 (2005) 39 Journal of World\nTrade 45.\n110 Rosas, supra note 72 at p. 140.

Yet, the CFI in FIAMMwas faced\nwith a claim to examine the non-contractual liability of the Community for the\nlawful conduct of the Community institutions drawing on national laws of the\nMember States. In fact, the CFI found that national laws enable individuals to\nobtain compensation for damages suffered even in the absence of unlawful con-\nduct by the perpetrator.119 Following Dorsch Consult, the CFI held that the\nCommunity could incur liability in the absence of unlawful conduct if actual\ndamage has been sustained, the causal link between that damage and the conduct\nof Community institutions has been established, and that damage was of unusual\nand special nature.120 The claim made by the applicants in FIAMM presented a\nprime opportunity to the CFI to examine the issue of damages and causal link,\nwhich, owing to the hurdle of direct effect, was hardly broached in the Court\u2019s case\nlaw in the area of WTO law.121\nStarting from the nature and extent of damages, the CFI simply stated that the\napplicants must have necessarily suffered commercial damage by reason of the\nincontestable rise in the price of their products, resulting from the imposition of an\nadditional duty of 96.5%.122 Straightforward as it is, this statement is not con-\nvincing. Clearly, damage in this context includes the damage actually suffered plus\nany lost profits.123 The emphasis on actually suffered runs counter to the pre-\nsumption \u2018must have necessarily suffered\u2019.124 Accordingly, in this context, dam-\nages should not be calculated on the basis of the amount by which the tariffs at\nthe imports of Community products have increased by virtue of the suspension of\nconcessions applied by the complaining WTO Member, but the actual effect the\n115 FIAMM at para. 113.\n116 FIAMM at para. 114.\n117 FIAMM at para. 137.\n118 FIAMM at para. 144.\n119 FIAMM at para. 159.\n120 FIAMM at para. 160.\n121 With the exception of the manifest lack of causality in Biret at paras. 63\u201364.\n122 FIAMM at para. 168.\n123 Cases 5, 7, 13-24\/66 Kampffmeyer v.

In this\nrespect, the CFI\u2019s presumption will be difficult to apply in cases of traders like\nLouis Vuitton whose sales of leather handbags recorded a surge in the US market\ndespite the sanctions.125\nGoing on to the issue of causal link, the CFI, referring to previous case law,\nestablished that causality exists when there is a sufficiently direct causal nexus\nbetween the conduct of the Community institutions and the damage suffered.126\nWhile the CFI recognized the option available to the United States to settle the\ndispute, it nonetheless explained that \u2018 the withdrawal of concessions in relation to\nthe Community results objectively, in accordance with the normal foreseeable\noperation of the WTO dispute settlement system accepted by the Community\u2019.127\nThe unilateral act by the United States to increase the customs duties on imports of\nbatteries does not, in the CFI\u2019s view, break the causal link. In the CFI\u2019s words, the\ndamage suffered by the applicants \u2018must be regarded as the immediate cause\u2019 of\nthe Community conduct.128\nTwo objections must be raised against the CFI\u2019s reasoning in this respect : first, it\nprovided a very broad interpretation of the concept of the \u2018direct causal link\u2019. In\nthe light of the large number of steps between the Community breach of WTO law\nand the damage suffered by an individual trader as a result of a WTO Member\u2019s\nsuspension of concessions,129 it ought to be questioned how immediate and direct\nsuch a causal relationship is. Extrapolating the conditio sine qua non theoretical\nfoundation of causality to other areas of Community law is likely to change the\nlandscape of Community liability as at the moment it sits uncomfortably with it.130\nIn fact, it is questionable how the CFI considers the causal link broken in a case in\nwhich the Community institutions enjoy no discretion at the adoption of the\nharmful act,131 while the opposite is the case for discretionary acts of other WTO\nMembers.132 Second, the CFI\u2019s analysis seems to disregard its previously vigorously\nadvocated thesis on the great flexibility of the WTO DSU provisions. Indeed,\nthere is a logical error here as, if the flexibility of the DSU is as great as the CFI\nhas repeatedly stated, the relationship between the conduct of the Community\ninstitutions and the damage suffered by the individual traders could not be\n125 While this raise has been attributed to either smart management, see, for instance, Ashok Som,\n\u2018Personal touch that built an empire of style and luxury\u2019 available at http:\/\/www.ashoksom.com\/\n3-Personal-touch%20.pdf, at p. 8 or American consumers\u2019 increasing demand for luxury products, see,\nfor instance, http:\/\/www.vivavocefashion.com\/front_page.html\/retail_news2001_04.html, no study as-\nsesses the competitive position of Louis Vuitton in the absence of sanctions.\n126 FIAMM at para. 178 and the case law mentioned there.\n127 FIAMM at para. 183.\n128 FIAMM at para. 185.\n129 Article 3.7 DSU.

See also, Kuijper supra note 110 at p.1337 who anticipates the problem.\nThe European Union and WTO law 63\ncharacterized as either \u2018 immediate\u2019 or \u2018direct \u2019. With regard to the suspension of\nconcessions, it should be pointed out here that in the light of recent disputes, even\nin the presence of DSB authorization, WTOMembers have been reluctant to apply\nretaliatory measures.133 Therefore, the imposition of additional duties on products\noriginating in the EC can hardly qualify as \u2018the normal foreseeable operation of\nthe WTO dispute settlement system\u2019.134\nDamage will be of an unusual nature, held the CFI in FIAMM, when it exceeds\nthe limits of the economic risks inherent in operating the sector concerned and of\nspecial nature when it affects a particular circle of economic operators in a dis-\nproportionate manner by comparison with other operators.135 In light of the nature\nof international trade, the CFI had little difficulty dismissing the claim brought by\nthe applicants that they suffered damage of an unusual nature and exercised\njudicial economy on the question of special nature.136\nWhilst a full critique of the FIAMM judgment escapes the confines of this con-\ntribution, it must be stated here that it sends mixed messages. The CFI correctly\nfollowed the established case law ruling out Community liability because of the\nlack of direct effect. It is submitted, however, that it erred in embarking on the\nanalysis of Community liability for lawful conduct. Even if such a principle can\nfind sufficient support in the cited judgments and national law,137 its operation\ncould not be seen as an alternative remedy when the unlawfulness of the acts of the\nCommunity institutions cannot be established because of the absence of direct\neffect. In addition, \u2018actual damage\u2019 and \u2018direct causal link\u2019 do not warrant such\nbroad interpretations. It could be assumed that the CFI\u2019s analysis is revealing of\nthe collective mindset of its members and potential disagreements regarding the\ncontinued Community Courts\u2019 reactive approach. In sum, this approach denies\nliability to private traders for damages suffered as a result of unlawful or lawful\nCommunity acts in the WTO domain.\nAs a precursor to the discussion on the coactive approach, it should be\npointed out that the discussion concerning the conditions for Community\nliability maintains its significance. That is because Community liability may apply\nin these cases. As will be demonstrated in detail below, the Community applies a\ncommunitarized version of WTO law in the context of the coactive approach. It\ncould be argued in this respect that communitarization of, say, the WTO Anti-\nDumping Agreement vests this Agreement with the constitutional qualities of\n133WT\/DS108 United States \u2013 Tax Treatment for Foreign Sales Corporations; WT\/DS136 United\nStates \u2013 Anti-Dumping Act of 1916; WT\/DS222 Canada \u2013 Export Credits and Loan Guarantees for\nRegional Aircraft.\n134 FIAMM at para. 183.\n135 FIAMM at para. 202.\n136 FIAMM at para. 212.\n137 FIAMM at paras. 158\u2013160.

By contrast, it could also be argued that\nsince WTO law is not capable of conferring rights on individuals, the content of\nthe exception created by the Court should only be construed to include the inci-\ndental review of legality of the Community measures under WTO law in annul-\nment proceedings, but not to establish a claim for Community liability.138 It must\nbe pointed out however that the Court is not likely to deal with the issue because of\nthe dual avenue available to traders to enforce their rights in Community Courts\nand the WTO Dispute Settlement and the measures taken by the institutions to\nminimize such an eventuality.139\nThe political institutions\nIn the reactive approach, the political institutions showed resistance towards the\nfull effect of WTO law. The most characteristic example of a reactive approach by\nthe Council is the very inclusion in the preamble to its decision concluding the\nWTO Agreement of a clause stating that \u2018Whereas, by its nature, the Agreement\nestablishing the World Trade Organization, including the Annexes thereto, is not\nsusceptible to being directly invoked in Community or Member State courts \u2019.140\nThe Council, in this instance, was acting within its powers as duly recognized by\nthe Court141 and this statement should be considered of cardinal importance, de-\nspite the Opinion to the contrary by Advocate General Saggio in Portuguese\nTextiles.142\nIn addition, the political institutions have adopted a reactive approach in specific\ninstances, primarily concerning those cases where they chose to maintain measures\nreflecting fundamental policy choices despite adverse Panel and Appellate Body\nrulings. This stance has been particularly important in the foundational years of\nthe WTO and tested the limits of the system. At the same time, it tested the\nCommunity\u2019s own limits as an idiosyncratic actor within this system.143\n3.

However, as already implied in\nthe course of the analysis of the Portuguese Textiles, there are clearly defined\nexceptions recognized by the Court. These exceptions can be classified as: the\nlegality standard, the transposition\/implementation, the clear reference, and the\nconsistent interpretation.144 The exceptions partly reflect the Court\u2019s response to\naction by the Community\u2019s political institutions showing inclination to include\nthe application of or reference to WTO law in their activities, and partly the\nrealization that, in some cases, judicial enforcement of WTO rules in the\nCommunity and national Courts serves the better application of these rules and\nfurthers the WTO objectives. The term \u2018coactive\u2019 in this sense does not simply\nrepresent a notable deviation from the lack of direct effect doctrine, it also signifies\nthe intention of the institutions to use WTO law in their activities alongside\nCommunity law.\nLegality standard\nUnder Article 300(7) EC, the conclusion of the WTO Agreement by the\nCommunity bears the consequence that both the Community and its Member\nStates must observe its provisions. The legality standard exception aims to enable\nthe Community to hold the Member States to their commitments. As stated in\nKupferberg :\nIn ensuring respect for commitments arising from an agreement concluded by the\nCommunity institutions the Member States fulfil an obligation not only in re-\nlation to the non-member country concerned but also and above all in relation to\nthe Community which has assumed responsibility for the due performance of the\nagreement. That is why the provisions of such an agreement, as the Court has\nalready stated in its judgment of 30 April 1974 in case 181\/73 Haegeman (1974)\nECR 449, form an integral part of the Community legal system.145\nThe Court underlined here the functional considerations present in the fulfilment\nof the Community\u2019s international obligations and the aim to avoid incurring in-\nternational responsibility.146 Premised upon the need to establish a unified front,\nwhich should not be undermined by Member States\u2019 breach of the Community\u2019s\ninternational commitments, and supported by the principle of cooperation and\nArticle 300(7) EC, the Community can coerce Member States to fulfil their\nobligations under international agreements. There is no issue of direct effect here,\nsimply an unconditional obligation incumbent on Member States every time the\nCommunity concludes an international agreement. It flows from the unique\nposition of the Community assuming its own obligations on the international\nplane, a consequence of the fact that it has been granted with legal personality to\n144 I prefer the terms \u2018transposition\u2019 and \u2018clear reference\u2019 adopted by Snyder, supra note 1 at p. 342\nover the \u2018indirect effect \u2019 terminology proposed by Eeckhout, supra note 27 at p. 40.\n145 Kupferberg at para. 13.\n146 Klabbers, supra note 4 at p. 281.\n66 ANTON I S ANTON IAD I S\nbe able to invoke the mechanisms available at Community level in order to ensure\nthat the Member States observe their obligations under the Treaties.\nAccordingly, when the Commission considers that Member States violate their\nobligations under the WTO Agreement, it may invoke enforcement proceedings in\norder to bring the recalcitrant Member States back to order. In the ordinary in-\nterpretation of Article 226 EC, Member States\u2019 failure to fulfil their obligations\nunder the Treaty includes also obligations assumed by the Community in the\nWTO.WTO rules become the Community legal standard by whichMember States\nmust abide. This obligation stems from the nature of the Community as a Customs\nUnion under the GATT, which demands that each Contracting Party shall take\nsuch reasonable measures as may be available to it to ensure observance of the\nprovisions of the GATT Agreement by the regional and local governments and\nauthorities within its territories.147 Given that the Community was perceived as a\nsingle Contracting Party in the GATT,148 the whole meaning of regional inte-\ngration arrangements within the international trading system would be frustrated\nshould the Community be unable to use the means available to it in order to\nenforce compliance with the GATT provisions.149\nThe most important case under the legality standard exception is the\nInternational Dairy Agreement (IDA).150 In that case, the Commission requested\nthe Court to declare that, by authorizing the importation of dairy products at a\ncustoms value lower than the minimum price provided by the IDA, an agreement\nannexed to the Tokyo Round of Multilateral trade negotiations conducted under\nthe GATT, Germany failed to fulfil its obligations under the Treaty. The Court\nobviated the examination of whether the Commission had the right to bring pro-\nceedings against a Member State under the GATT, and, on the facts of the case,\nhad little difficulty in concluding that Germany was in violation of the Annexes to\nthe IDA. In order to arrive at this conclusion the Court had to overcome difficult\nhurdles. The most important was the claim by Germany, taken up by Advocate\nGeneral Tesauro in his Opinion,151 that the Community legislation on inward\nprocessing relief was in violation of the IDA too. The Court asserted the duty of\nconsistent interpretation and held that the relevant Council Regulation could be\ninterpreted in conformity with the IDA.152\nThis judgment has attracted criticism as it seemingly promotes inconsistency\nand, possibly, also an imbalance between the rights and obligations of the Member\nStates. It was argued that allowing the Commission to challenge a Member State\nmeasure for violation of the GATT, while at the same time denying a Member\nState the corollary right of challenge in annulment proceedings, \u2018 is on balance not\n147 Article XXIV:12 GATT.\n148 Article XXIV:1 GATT.\n149 In this case Article 226 EC Treaty.\n150 Case C-61\/94 Commission v.

Had the Commission or any other institution\nbeen permitted to apply for the annulment of Community legislation, while the\nMember States had not, it would have been a comparable yet untenable position.\nHowever, the different treatment of qualitatively different proceedings (annulment\nin Portuguese Textiles and enforcement in IDA) can be reconciled. First, what is at\nstake in annulment proceedings is the fulfilment of an EC obligation vis-a`-vis the\nGATT\/WTOwhilst in enforcement proceedings the fulfilment of an obligation of a\nMember State vis-a`-vis the EC. As a result, in both cases, the Community upholds\nEC law over international law or national law. This seems to remedy the alleged\ninconsistency154 and raises the question of the supremacy of the Community legal\norder, which will be dealt with below.155 In addition, the Court\u2019s statement in\nHaegeman, regarding international law forming an integral part of the\nCommunity legal order,156 is vindicated in that WTO law will be applied in en-\nforcement proceedings.157\nMore recently, the Court condemned Ireland for failing to adhere to the 1971\nBerne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works.158 Unlike\nIDA, which concerned compliance with an agreement concluded by the\nCommunity, it is not Community membership that provides the cause of action in\nthis case, since the Community is not a party to the Berne Convention. The Berne\nConvention is, in principle, binding on the Community indirectly by virtue of\nArticle 9 of the TRIPs Agreement in accordance with which the Community, as a\nWTO Member bound by all covered agreements, is obliged to afford the level of\ncopyright protection enshrined in the Convention to all other WTO Members.\nCuriously, the TRIPS Agreement is not mentioned at all but, instead, Article 5 of\nProtocol 28 to the EEA Agreement, which obliges the parties to the EEA to adhere\nto the Berne Convention.159\nTransposition\/Implementation\nIn the following aspect of the coactive approach, the Community is re-\nquired to act in conformity with WTO law insofar as it has adopted\nmeasures intended to implement certain of its provisions.

Nakajima claimed that the duties\nwere in violation of certain provisions of the GATT Anti-Dumping Code and\nsought to rely on those in order to achieve the annulment of the Regulation. The\nCouncil argued that, as with the GATT, the Anti-Dumping Code does not confer\non individuals rights which may be relied on before the Court and that the pro-\nvisions of that Code are not directly applicable within the Community.163 The\nCourt accepted that at the adoption of Council Regulation 2423\/88 (the Basic\nAntidumping Regulation at the time) the Community intended to implement the\ninternational commitments stemming from the GATT Anti-Dumping Code. The\nCommunity must therefore ensure compliance with its international obligations at\nthe adoption of implementing measures. Thus, the legality of Regulations im-\nposing anti-dumping duties should be examined against the provisions of the\nGATT Anti-Dumping Code.164\nThe Court of Justice confirmed the validity of the Nakajima doctrine in the\nWTO context in Petrotub,165 a case that concerned the imposition of anti-dumping\nduties on imports of certain seamless pipes and tubes of iron or non-alloy steel\noriginating in Romania. It explained, again in the context of anti-dumping, that\nsince the Community, pursuant to the Basic Anti-Dumping Regulation, intended\nto transpose the WTO Anti-Dumping Agreement (ADA), the Court may review\nthe legality of Community measures in the field of anti-dumping under the ADA.\nThe Court went even further to explain that those rules being subsumed within the\nCommunity legal system attract the application of an additional layer of protec-\ntion prescribed by this system, in that case Article 253 EC Treaty on the obligation\nto provide reasons. The implication which flows is that the ADA provisions in\nquestion shall be treated qua Community law. The Court then laid down an ad-\nditional implication: the requirement to state reasons in that particular case should\nbe interpreted in the context of anti-dumping, namely the procedure provided in\nArticle 2.4.2 ADA and the Commission\u2019s undertakings assumed within the WTO\nCommittee on Anti-Dumping,166 thereby fully fusing the two legal systems in the\ncontext of anti-dumping.\n160 Eeckhout supra note 27 at p. 56 uses the term \u2018implementation\u2019 instead of \u2018transposition\u2019.\n161 Chiquita at para. 120.\n162 Case C-69\/89 Nakajima All Precision Co.

The Court\u2019s jurisdiction to deal with\nsuch matters does not only equip affected parties with substantive arguments\nstemming from the ADA but also establishes the possibility that parallel proceed-\nings may be instituted challenging the same Community legislation both before the\nCourt of Justice andWTO dispute settlement. In the EC\u2013Bed Linen case,167 a Panel\nand the Appellate Body had the opportunity to examine the conformity of Council\nRegulation 2398\/97 imposing definitive anti-dumping duties on cotton bed linen\noriginating in India with the ADA. In its Report, the Panel concluded that the said\nRegulation violated certain provisions of the ADA.168 The Community appealed\nthe Panel findings, and, while the Appellate Body reversed some of the Panel\u2019s\nconclusions, it maintained that the \u2018zeroing\u2019 methodology,169 applied by the EC, is\ninconsistent with Article 2.4.2. ADA.170\nThe EC\u2013Bed Linen dispute raises important questions regarding the impact of\nWTO bodies\u2019 interpretations in the Community legal order,171 also in connection\nwith the preceding discussion of direct effect of Panel and Appellate Body\nrulings.172 Following the facts of the EC\u2013Bed Linen case, what will the Court of\nJustice do when faced with a complaint against the \u2018zeroing\u2019 methodology in-\nconsistency with Article 2.4.2 ADA? In principle, the Court has jurisdiction to\ndecide the issue anyway; nonetheless, the timing of the parallel proceedings raises\nseveral possibilities. If the dispute is still pending in the WTO, the Court could, if\nit finds inconsistency with the ADA, deprive those proceedings of their subject\nmatter by annulling the Regulation. Equally, it may decide that the \u2018zeroing\u2019\nmethodology is consistent with the ADA. In both cases, it can also stay its pro-\nceedings in anticipation of the Panel and Appellate Body rulings.173 Staying the\nproceedings should be the least preferred option; since the Court has jurisdiction\nto assess the legality of Anti-Dumping Regulations against the ADA, it should\nexercise it. A finding of consistency by the Court of the \u2018zeroing\u2019 methodology\nwith the ADA, followed by a contrasting finding by the WTO bodies shifts\nto the Community institutions the responsibility to comply with the DSB rec-\nommendations and remedy the situation as they would have done in the absence\n167 WT\/DS141 European Communities \u2013 Anti-Dumping Duties on Imports of Cotton-Type Bed\nLinen from India (complaint by India).\n168 WT\/DS141\/R.\n169 In the calculation of the dumping margin the Community applied the following methodology:\nFirst, it divided the Indian bedlinen into several categories. In some, the export price was lower than the\nnormal price and in some it was higher, the later being called a \u2018negative dumping margin\u2019. Then, it\ncalculated the average dumping margin calculating the negative dumping margins as zero. Obviously, the\n\u2018zeroing\u2019 methodology resulted into a higher dumping margin.\n170 WT\/DS141\/AB\/R.\n171 See, Natalie McNelis, \u2018What Obligations Are Created by World Trade Organization Dispute\nSettlement Reports?\u2019 (2003) 37 Journal of World Trade 647.\n172 Section 2.\n173 Bourgeois, supra note 153 at 121 citing K.

When the WTO has dealt with the first issue, it should\nbe conceded that the Court of Justice should accept the legal interpretations found\nin the DSB recommendations. In this respect, they could be treated as directly\neffective. The ensuing inconsistency that the direct effect of only certain Panel\nand Appellate Body rulings is recognized is methodologically sound. The fact\nthat only certain WTO provisions may be directly effective in the Community legal\norder once transposed, necessitates that the interpretations given by the bodies\nentrusted with the task of providing security and predictability to the system\nshould follow.\nIn the aftermath of EC\u2013Bed Linen, the Council was faced with the possibility\nof actions for annulment before the Court of Justice by traders against whose\nimports the same \u2018zeroing\u2019 methodology had been applied. As mentioned above,\nthe Court would be expected to apply the interpretations contained in the\nPanel and Appellate Body Reports, annul the Regulations ex tunc, and require\nthe reimbursement of the collected duties. In response, the Council adopted\nthe Enabling Regulation174 whose provisions shall be analysed below.175\nSuffice it to say here that it requires the Council to take the necessary measures\nto bring Community acts in conformity with the rulings provided in the DSB\nrecommendations. The Enabling Regulation provides prospective remedies and\nexpressly states the intention to avoid the reimbursement of the collected\nduties.176 The interest of the Council in pre-empting the Court of Justice\u2019s\njurisdiction offers strong evidence in favour of the argument that in the field of\nAnti-Dumping and Subsidies, the Panel and Appellate Body Reports are directly\neffective.\nThe recognition of direct effect in areas falling within the transposition\/\nimplementation exception means that the infringement of WTO law will readily\nestablish a sufficiently serious breach that will trigger Community liability.177\nHowever, in the circumstances of EC\u2013Bed Linen, a claim for compensation, while\nlegally possible, is unlikely to succeed. As mentioned above, traders have a dual\navenue to enforce their rights under the ADA. In addition, it could be argued that\nWTO law falling within the scope of the Nakajima exception, whilst allowing\nincidental review of legality, does not grant rights to individuals. Finally, it would\nbe difficult to argue that in, for instance, applying the \u2018zeroing\u2019 methodology at the\ncalculation of the dumping margin \u2013 a common practice internationally in the field\n174 Council Regulation (EC) No 1515\/2001 on the measures that maybe taken by the Community\nfollowing a report adopted by the WTO Dispute Settlement Body concerning anti-dumping and anti-\nsubsidies matters O.J.

Fediol claimed that\nthose practices were in violation of certain provisions of the GATT. Following\nan investigation, the Commission concluded that there was no violation and\nFediol applied to the Court for the annulment of the Commission\u2019s decision.\nThe Commission based its defence of inadmissibility on the argument that\nGATT has no direct effect. The Court however held that it cannot be inferred\nfrom the lack of direct effect that \u2018citizens may not, in proceedings before\nthe Court, rely on the provisions of GATT in order to obtain a ruling on\nwhether conduct criticized in a complaint lodged under Article 3 of Regulation\nNo 2641\/84 constitutes an illicit commercial practice within the meaning of\nthat Regulation.\u2019182 The gist of the ruling is that, irrespective of the lack of\ndirect effect, the Commission, at the exercise of its discretion on whether to\npursue a complaint under the GATT Dispute Settlement, has to interpret the\nrelevant GATT provisions. This should not preclude the private parties having\nan interest and being involved in the procedure from requesting the judicial re-\nview of the Commission\u2019s decision. In essence, since the Commission possesses\nthe prerogative of interpretation of the GATT for the purposes of initiating a\nGATT\/WTO complaint it should not then hide behind the lack of direct effect of\nthe GATT.183 It is preferable that review of its decision be available to interested\nparties.\n178 Joined Cases C-46\/93 and C-48\/93 Brasserie du Pe\u02c6cheur and Factortame [1996] ECR I-1029 vat\npara. 55; Joined Cases C-178\/94, C-179\/94, C-188\/94, C-189\/94, C-190\/94 Dillenkofer and Others\nv.

The clear reference exception was implicitly\nconfirmed by the CFI in FICF.185\nThe significance of the clear reference exception can hardly be overstated.\nUnlike the transposition exception, GATT\/WTO law here is not interpreted qua\nCommunity law but on its own merits. What is more important is that, in the\n\u2018clear reference\u2019 cases \u2013 overlooking for a moment that the challenge involves a\nCommunity act \u2013 it is, in essence, not the conformity of Community legislation\ntested against WTO law but the legislation of another WTO Member. The\nconsequent application of WTO law by the Court in these cases is not such as to\nhave any further effects in the Community legal order. Conversely, the interpret-\nation given is limited within the facts of \u2018 the given case\u2019 and \u2018certain specific\ncommercial practices \u2019.186\nConsistent interpretation\nThe previous three instances of the coactive approach concern the application of\nWTO law by the Court of Justice itself and not the Member States\u2019 courts. The\ndoctrine of consistent interpretation, however, applies in all instances when both\nthe Court of Justice and Member States\u2019 courts are called to interpret otherwise\nnon-directly effective WTO law.\nThe Court of Justice, as is characteristic of courts of several Member States,\nprimarily those belonging to the dualist tradition,187 consistently made efforts to\ninterpret EC law in conformity with the Community\u2019s international obligations.188\nRegarding WTO law, the case laying down the foundations of the doctrine\nof consistent interpretation is Herme`s.189 Herme`s was a French company whose\ntrade mark \u2018Herme`s\u2019 was infringed by FHT.

The Court held that, because Regulation\n40\/94 on the Community trademark provided for provisional measures and\nthose measures should be taken in the light of the wording and purpose of\nArticle 50(6) TRIPs,191 the Court had jurisdiction to interpret it, even if the\nfacts of the case did not concern a Community trademark but one registered\nin the Benelux.192 This is because it is clearly in the Community interest that,\nin order to forestall future differences of interpretation, Article 50(6) TRIPs\nshould be interpreted uniformly whatever the circumstances in which it is to\napply.193\nThe Court\u2019s assumption that national courts were to interpret Article 50(6)\nTRIPs, read together with Advocate General Tesauro\u2019s Opinion favouring direct\neffect for Article 50(6) TRIPs, raised the question of direct effect. The Court\navoided the question and simply extended to national courts the duty to interpret\nnational provisions in the light of international agreements concluded by the\nCommunity.194 The essence of the doctrine of consistent interpretation was later\nmade clear in Dior where the Court\u2019s reasoning can be summarized, in a general\nmanner, into the following proposition: in areas falling within the subject-matter\nof the WTO Agreement and the Community has already legislated, courts of the\nMember States must by virtue of Community law interpret the provisions of\nnational law as far as possible in the light of the otherwise non-directly effective\nprovisions of the WTO Agreement.195\nOverall, the duty of consistent interpretation provides a satisfactory alternative\nto the full direct effect of WTO law. While acknowledging that, owing to their\nspecial nature, WTO rules are not capable of being enforced in the Community\nlegal order, their undoubted importance at the construction of Community legis-\nlation in areas of substantive legislative overlap is thereby restored.196 The practical\nimplication of these judgments is that WTO law will be interpreted and applied\nby Community and national Courts on a daily basis save for when it is in conflict\nwith Community law.\n190Herme`s at para. 24.\n191Herme`s at para. 28.\n192Herme`s at para. 30.\n193Herme`s at para. 32.

The consistency of this\nstrategy is demonstrated by the subsequent legislative activities of the Community,\nespecially in the field of dumping and subsidies. In the example of the Enabling\nRegulation, the interaction between the Court and the political institutions of the\nCommunity in the application of WTO law becomes manifest.\nThe Enabling Regulation\nAs mentioned above, shortly after the adoption by the DSB of the Appellate Body\nReport in EC\u2013Bed Linen, the Council adopted Regulation 1515\/2001 (the\nEnabling Regulation) laying down the measures to be taken by the EC so as to\ncomply with adverse Panel and Appellate Body Reports.201 In accordance with the\nEnabling Regulation, the Community should either amend or repeal the disputed\nmeasures or adopt any special measures deemed to be appropriate in the circum-\nstances in order to follow the Panel and Appellate Body rulings.202 The\nCommission may request all parties to submit all necessary information and it may\nconduct a review insofar as this is appropriate.203 The Council may also suspend\nthe application of the measure but only for a limited period of time.204 The Council\nand the Commission may also review measures, not the subject of the dispute, if\n197 Case 12\/86 Meryem Demirel v.

However, as McNelis211 pointed out, the Council adopted the\nEnabling Regulation because it provides further options in addition to the\ninterim review provided in the Basic Anti-dumping Regulation.212 More-\nover, the procedure enshrined in the Enabling Regulation not only seeks to\nenhance the transparency, predictability and automaticity of the response to\na ruling but, as mentioned above, to deter the Court from drawing inspi-\nration from the interpretations contained in the Panel and Appellate Body\nrulings in line with the Nakajima doctrine, annulling Anti-Dumping Regu-\nlations and ordering the reimbursement of the collected duties to the affected\ntraders. This mechanism of self-defence has the welcome, from a WTO per-\nspective, repercussions of extending the legal interpretations given by the\nPanels and Appellate Body to sets of facts unrelated to the WTO dispute\nand beyond the res judicata created by the Reports. At the same time, it pre-empts\nthe Community Courts from applying these interpretations and reserves this\nright to the Council and the Commission. Once in control, the political institutions\ncan utilize the WTO Dispute Settlement System in order to coerce the Com-\nmunity\u2019s trading partners to comply with the same legal interpretations and\nestablish a level-playing field. For instance, on the issue of \u2018zeroing\u2019 methodology,\nas soon as the dispute with India ended, the EC initiated a dispute against the\n205 Article 2 Enabling Regulation.\n206 McNelis, supra note 171 at pp. 659\u2013661.\n207 WT\/DS141 European Communities \u2013 Anti-dumping measures on imports of cotton-type bed-\nlinen from India.\n208 Paragraph 6.119 of the Panel Report upheld by the Appellate Body in Paragraph 86(1) of its\nReport.\n209 Notice regarding the anti-dumping measures in force following a ruling of the Dispute Settlement\nBody of the World Trade Organisation adopted on March 2001 O.J.

It could be argued that these instances were seen as\nrunning counter to the Community\u2019s stated policy of compliance with the WTO\nAgreement. Some years on, it seems that the Community is developing an\nexcellent record of compliance with rulings while settling most disputes at the\ndiplomatic stage of dispute settlement.214 In the Bananas dispute, the Community\nadopted legislation to bring its regime into conformity with the rulings,215 it\nrequested a waiver to maintain its current regime for a transitional period,216 and,\ndespite some difficulties,217 the Community seems to be bringing the matter to a\nsatisfactory conclusion.218 Similarly, in Hormones, the Community not only did it\ntake measures which, in its opinion, complied with the DSB recommendations,219\nbut also challenged the continuing retaliation by Canada and United States.220\nIn sum, one could describe the coactive approach as the Community playing by\nthe rules.\n213 WT\/DS294 United States \u2013 Laws, Regulations and Methodology for Calculating Dumping\nMargins (\u2018Zeroing \u2019) complaint brought by the EC on 19 June 2003.\n214 Elisa Baroncini, \u2018The European Community and the Diplomatic Phase of the WTO Dispute\nSettlement Understanding\u2019 (1998) 18 Yearbook of European Law 157.

Proactive approach\nThe term proactive defines the position of the Community institutions which is not\nlimited to the observance of the obligations undertaken by the Community and the\nMember States under the WTO Agreements but is perceived to promote WTO law\nas the standard for the conduct of international trade externally and the bench-\nmark for the adoption of internal legislation. In the context of global governance,\nproactivity has been demonstrated in the full support provided by the Community\ninstitutions to the WTO and the confidence entrusted to its dispute settlement\nsystem. Among the institutions, the Court\u2019s approach towards WTO law cannot\nbe immediately characterized as proactive, a position which is in contrast with the\none taken by Advocates General in their Opinions. It is uncontested that the main\nlocus of proactivity towards the WTO has been the practice of the Community\u2019s\npolitical institutions.\nIn the proactive approach, the Community actively encourages the application\nof WTO law. WTO law is set as the normative benchmark for the Community\u2019s\ninternal and external policies and international agreements. Regarding internal\npolicies, the political institutions adopt legislation that purports to be in con-\nformity with WTO law and is normally presumed to achieve this objective.221\nConsequently, it is not uncommon for Community legislation to state that its\nprovisions comply with the relevant provisions of the WTO covered agreements.222\nAt the formulation of Community policies, the Commission intends to make\nthem WTO compliant and, in fact, goes to great lengths to develop a full\nWTO-compliance test at its interaction with the other institutions.223 The realiz-\nation that WTO law is omnipresent in the everyday activities of the Commission\nDGs, as well as the services of the Council and the European Parliament, clearly\nindicates that there is an emerging WTO culture, which started to dominate the\nlaw-making process within the Community.\nThe role of WTO law in the Community\u2019s external relations raises several im-\nportant considerations. The WTO and its legal system have developed into an\nessential instrument of the Community\u2019s trade diplomacy. Politically, the\nCommunity assists and actively encourages the broadening of the WTO member-\nship by sponsoring the accession process of its important trading partners.224\nThe Community fully engages in the long and cumbersome accession process\ndeveloping countries and formerly centrally planned economies are faced with, it\nintroduces WTO law by reference in its relations with non-WTO members, and\n221 Snyder, supra note 1 at p. 316.\n222 See, Sebastiaan Princen, \u2018EC Compliance with WTO Law: the Interplay of Law and Politics\u2019\n(2004) 15 European Journal of International Law 555; Sebastiaan Princen, EU Regulation and\nTransatlantic Trade (Kluwer Law International, 2002).\n223 de Bu\u00b4rca and Scott, supra note 1.\n224 The EU acted as a catalyst to the Chinese accession and is doing the same with the accession of the\nRussian Federation to the WTO.\n78 ANTON I S ANTON IAD I S\ntreats the WTO Agreements as the common vocabulary for the conduct of inter-\nnational trade. For example, international agreements concluded before the entry\ninto force of theWTOAgreement made reference to the forthcoming conclusion of\nthe Uruguay Round, rendering the agreements\u2019 provisions subject to amendment\nin the light of the results of multilateral negotiations.225 In some cases, agreements\nconcluded by the Community will stipulate the revision of their provisions when\naccession to the WTO is achieved by the other contracting party.226\nAll in all, it is hard to find any post-1995 Association Agreements, Partnership\nand Cooperation Agreements, Trade and Development Agreements, Stabilization\nand Association Agreements concluded by the Community without a detailed\nreference to WTO law.227 The relations thus established are instrumental towards\nthe furthering of the objectives of the multilateral system as it becomes clear for\nWTO and non-WTOMembers alike what standard they are expected to follow in\ntheir trade relations with the Community and its Member States. In so far as\nbilateral agreements of a general nature are concerned, turningWTO rules into the\napplicable standard will inevitably strengthen the culture of WTO compliance in\nthe Community\u2019s legislative practice.\nIn addition, WTO law has been at the forefront of sectoral agreements con-\ncluded with developed trading partners, in particular the US. For instance, the\npreamble of Council Decision 98\/258\/EC on the conclusion of the Agreement be-\ntween the European Community and the United States of America on sanitary\nmeasures to protect public and animal health in trade in live animals and animal\nproducts states, \u2018Whereas the Agreement between the European Community and\nthe United States of America on sanitary measures to protect public and animal\n225 Article 59 of the Europe Agreement establishing an Association between the European\nCommunities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Bulgaria, of the other part O.J.\nL358, states: \u2018The provisions of Chapters II, III, and IV of Title IV shall be adjusted by decision of the\nAssociation Council in the light of the result of the negotiations on services taking place in the Uruguay\nRound and in particular to ensure that under any provisions of this Agreement a Party grants to the other\nParty a treatment no less favourable than that accorded under the provisions of a future GATS\nAgreement. \u2019\n226 See, for instance, Articles 4, 5, 16 and Annex 2 of the Agreement on partnership and cooperation\nestablishing a partnership between the European Communities and their Member States, of one part, and\nthe Russian Federation, of the other part, O.J. L327, 28\/11\/1997, pp. 3\u201369.\n227 Notably, Articles 20, 24, 61, 70, 78, 80, 83, 89, 92, and 103 of the Agreement establishing an\nassociation between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of\nChile, of the other part, O.J. L352, 30\/12\/2002, pp. 3\u20131439. The EC \u2013 Chile Agreement is particularly\ninteresting in that it not only it refers to the WTO generally or the WTO Annexed Agreements specifically,\nbut also to Decisions taken by bodies established under the WTO Agreement, in particular, the TBT\nCommittee (Article 85). More importantly, it subordinates the dispute settlement system established under\nthe Agreement to the WTO DSU should any of the contracting parties chooses to seek redress for a\nviolation of obligations under the EC \u2013 Chile in theWTO (Article 189(4)(c)). Also, Articles 6, 15, 29, 65 of\nthe Stabilization and Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member\nStates, of the one part, and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, of the other part, O.J. L84, 20\/\n03\/2004, pp. 13\u201381 and in particular Article 69(5) which for the purposes of states aids sets the relevant\nWTO rules and Community legislation as alternative normative frameworks.\nThe European Union and WTO law 79\nhealth in trade in live animals and animal products provides an adequate means\nfor putting into practice the provisions of the WTO Agreement on the application\nof sanitary and phytosanitary measures as regards public and animal health\nmeasures. \u2019228 In fact, the agreement establishes a Joint Committee, which is en-\ntrusted with the task to guide the activities carried out under the Agreement.229 At a\nfirst glance, such agreement must be interpreted as a bilateral instrument, which\nseeks to apply and consequentially promote the WTO rules. However, scratching\nbelow the surface, one must note that, although the development of mutually\nacceptable SPS standards must be seen as furthering the objectives and principles\nof the WTO Agreement, the SPS Agreement in this instance, it may also have\nthe side effect of restricting market access to non-participants to such a bilateral\narrangement.230 This remark notwithstanding, the Community\u2019s policy to con-\nclude bilateral mutual recognition agreements with reference to WTO law clearly\nforms part of its proactive approach.\nFrom the point of view of judicial enforcement, it could be argued that pro-\nvisions of agreements concluded by the Community containing clear reference to\nthe WTO Agreement could develop direct effect ; predominantly so, regarding\nagreements with states non-members of the WTO, and, therefore, incapable of\navailing themselves of the WTO DSU. This is reinforced by the requirement in-\nserted in such agreements to be implemented \u2018 in full conformity with the pro-\nvisions of the WTO\u2019.231 Importantly, according to the Court\u2019s case law, the nature\nand purpose of these agreements do not preclude individuals from invoking their\nprovisions in national courts.232 When such provisions refer to WTO rules, the\nanswer to the question of their judicial enforceability depends on whether the\nspecific provisions of the WTO Agreement to which the Community\u2019s bilateral\nagreements refer will be treated as forming part of the latter agreements. If this is\nthe case, they should be analysed in the light of the nature and purpose of the\nCommunity\u2019s agreements and not the WTO Agreement. Were this to be accepted\nand should they contain a clear, precise, and unconditional obligation, they will be\nenforced in national courts in accordance with the established case law.233 In the\nalternative, it can be argued that in such cases both the Community and the as-\nsociated states intended to transpose specific WTO rules in their legal orders.\n228 O.J.

This goes further\nthan the nature of DSB recommendations under the WTO Agreement itself and\npossibly further than the Enabling Regulation, analysed above. In addition, should\nthe conditions identified in the previous paragraph apply, and WTO rules become\ndirectly effective by virtue of reference to them in the Community\u2019s international\nagreements, then Panel and Appellate Body interpretations of these provisions\nmust be taken into account. If the opposite is the case, it will be difficult to argue in\nfavour of direct effect of Panel and Appellate Body rulings for the reasons ident-\nified by the Court in the analysis of the reactive approach, in particular after the\nCourt\u2019s judgment in Van Parys. By contrast, it could be argued that the proviso in\nthe PCA with Azerbaijan may simply extend the general interpretative duty and\npractice of the Community institutions to employ the interpretations rendered by\nthe WTO bodies236 to organs established under international agreements con-\ncluded by the Community.\nThe above analysis is illustrative of the emergence of WTO law as a standard at\nthe carrying out of the Community\u2019s internal and external policies. The import-\nance of WTO law as the standard for the conduct of international trade regardless,\nit is difficult to surmise the purpose behind the institutional WTOphilia, particu-\nlarly evident within the Commission. Clearly, it is the conflict-avoidance \u2013 and\nconsequently, WTO dispute avoidance \u2013 strategy of the Commission than the\nsuitability of the WTO norms. Observing the Community\u2019s international com-\nmitments is important; however, they can only serve as a framework wherein the\n234 As explained by the CFI in Chiquita at para. 124 \u2018The applicant rightly argues that application of\nthe Nakajima case law is not, a priori, limited to the area of anti-dumping.

These are, in some instances, significantly different from those of the\nWTO. Unless an express reference to the need for compliance with WTO is in-\nserted in the preamble to the EC Treaty, the Community should primarily concern\nitself with the formulation of policies in the interests of the Community and its\nMember States which may not necessarily coincide with, and are normally more\ncomplex than, the rudimentary framework established by the WTO. While the\nproactive approach is, in general, welcome, limits to the proactive practice of\nthe Community\u2019s political institutions must be set.\n5. Synthesis and critique\nThe starting point for the assessment of the application of WTO law in the\nCommunity legal order should be the balancing act the Community institutions,\nincluding the Court, need to perform between two competing considerations: the\nsupremacy of international law and the supremacy of Community law.237 While\nthe supremacy of international law has always been appealing to commentators\nregarding the Community as a sui generis legal order founded by international\nlaw,238 the Court has been vigilant at the support of the supremacy of Community\nlaw.239 In fact, the Court, in Opinion 1\/91, was quick to acknowledge the su-\npremacy of the Community Treaties over provisions of the proposed EEA\nAgreement. It held that the jurisdiction of the proposed EEA Court affected the\nallocation of responsibilities as defined by the EC Treaty and therefore, under-\nmined the autonomy of the Community legal order.240 Inevitably, the recognition\nof direct effect of WTO law would deprive the Court of Justice from the authority\nto uphold the supremacy of the Community.\nThe scales in the balancing act could be represented by the concepts of monism\nand dualism; monism being inherently prone to accord supremacy to international\nlaw and dualism to domestic\/Community law. The catalysts for the balancing act\nin this sense are \u2018compatibility \u2019 and \u2018direct effect \u2019. The starting point for the\nanalysis of the relationship between international law and Community law should\nbe Article 300(5) which provides that when an agreement \u2018calls for \u2019241 amend-\nments to the Treaty, those must be adopted first before the agreement is concluded.\nFurther, Article 300(6), which concerns the advisory jurisdiction of the Court,\nprovides that where the Court of Justice finds that an envisaged international\nagreement is incompatible with the Treaty, the agreement may enter into force\nonly if the Treaty is amended. These paragraphs represent a definitive statement\n237 Klabbers, supra note 4 at p. 271.\n238 Pescatore, supra note 31.\n239 Christian Timmermans, \u2018The EU and Public International Law\u2019 (1999) 4 European Foreign\nAffairs Review 181.\n240 Opinion 1\/91 [1991] ECR I-6079.\n241 Emphasis added.\n82 ANTON I S ANTON IAD I S\nthat the Treaties, as the \u2018Constitution\u2019 of the Community, are supreme and cannot\nbe subordinated to provisions of international agreements unless the authors of the\nTreaty so decide.242 Article 300(7) states \u2018Agreements concluded under the con-\nditions set out in this Article \u2013 namely, the conditions enshrined in the previous\nsix paragraphs of Article 300, including paragraphs 5 and 6 \u2013 shall be binding on\nthe institutions of the Community and on the Member States\u2019 ; does this presume\nthat those agreements shall be binding insofar as they are compatible with the\nTreaty? This constitutes a reasonable assumption.\nThe obligation of compatibility of international agreements has recently been\nextended also to the internal rules. Indeed, the Council and the Commission are\nnow charged with the task to ensure this at the negotiation of international\nagreements.243 While, from a WTO legal perspective,244 this amendment is not a\nnovelty as it integrates a pre-existing obligation into the Community Treaties, the\nCouncil and the Commission will be faced with a considerable task at the con-\nclusion of the Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations if they are properly to\ndischarge this responsibility. Nonetheless, while the \u2018compatibility\u2019 catalyst is\nrelatively unexplored, its emergence heralds a notable shift of the Treaty authors to\na dualist approach towards WTO law. This will be seen in the future, account\nbeing taken of the proliferation of studies comparing the substantive law of the\nWTO and the EU245 and the building of a body of jurisprudence by the Panels and\nAppellate Body of the WTO.\nMoving on to the \u2018direct effect \u2019 catalyst,246 the Court has been unequivocal. Its\noutright denial of direct effect of WTO law points towards a dualist understanding\nand the supremacy of Community legal order over the international one. The\nnotable exceptions analysed in the context of the coactive approach prove the rule.\nBeyond the reasons analysed previously, some further considerations and con-\nditions for change of course will follow. The WTO \u2013 unlike the Community,\nwhich created a new legal order whose subjects are not only theMember States but\nalso their nationals247 \u2013 does not enjoy such high aspirations.248 On the contrary, it\nwas designed in the traditional public international law sense in which states and\n242 Bourgeois, supra note 153 at p. 97.\n243 Article 133(3) EC Treaty as amended by the Treaty of Nice.\n244 Article XIV:4 WTO Agreement.\n245 Marise Cremona, \u2018Neutrality or Discrimination?

Despite its broad scope, it is\nclear that its Members never wished it to become a new world legal order, com-\nprising also their citizens. Its structure and mechanisms are such so as to exclude\nthe citizens from being part of the system.249 Further, the WTO is characterized by\nthe absence of a norm-generating mechanism.250 The rounds of multilateral trade\nnegotiations strike a delicate balance of rights and concessions, which, owing to\nthe intergovernmental nature of the agreement, confer public law rights belonging\nto the WTO Members rather than the individual traders.\nThe jewel of this international law structure is the rigorous dispute settlement\nsystem established by the DSU. The clear and unambiguous nature of its provisions\ncan be advocated as a reason for opening up the Community to the direct effect of\nWTO law. In this respect, one wonders what purpose such a rigorous dispute\nsettlement serves if the WTO Agreement intended to confer rights on individuals\nenforceable in WTO Members\u2019 courts.251 It has been argued that since the old\nGATT flexibility is gone, there is no need to insist upon the lack of direct effect, as\nnow there is a binding international adjudication. This argument is not convincing\nat all. On the contrary, the bindingness and rigour of the DSU militate against\ndirect effect. Private parties have national avenues to invite their governments\nto pursue their interests in Geneva and the guarantee that once there, a report\ncreating a binding obligation in international law will, sooner or later, serve their\ninterests. This is further strengthened by the fact that, at least in the context of\nthe TBR, the Court of Justice has granted private parties a significant avenue of\ncontrol of the institutions at the exercise of their functions, thus offering a\ncounterbalance for the denial of direct effect.252\nWere the opposite the case, the choice of market access barriers to be challenged\nwould be determined by the interests of private parties and not the WTO\nMembers. This transfer of control clearly falls beyond what the parties have agreed\nwhen concluding the Uruguay Round Agreements and establishing the multilateral\ntrading system under the administration of the WTO. From the point of view of\nencouraging compliance with the WTO, it should be pointed out that enforcement\nin national and Community courts can only have the effect of repealing the WTO-\ninconsistent legislation. This hardly resembles the compliance envisaged within the\nDSU itself. From a policy point of view, it is in principle undesirable to have the\nWTO bodies and Community Courts handling the same cases. They are destined\n249 With the exception of NGOs in an attempt to embrace civil society (Article V:2 WTO Agreement)\nand certain procedural rights.

It is unfair for individual traders\nto pay the bill either by being subject to market access barriers or suffering the\nconsequences from the suspension of concessions affecting their trade. Does this in\nany way mitigate the stance against direct effect of the WTO and, in particular,\nCommunity liability for breach of WTO law? The answer should be in the nega-\ntive. What this realization does is to expose the shortcomings of the WTO system\nand encourage proposals for its reform instead of challenging the proper under-\nstanding of this system by the Court of Justice. Rosas has suggested that the system\nof suspension of concessions should be abolished in favour of a system of com-\npensation, whereby the Arbitrators under Article 22.6 DSU will calculate the\namount of nullification or impairment of benefits suffered by a WTOMember and\ndetermine the sum of compensation due.256 This is a proposal which should muster\nsupport in the reform of the DSU process.\nRegarding the proactive approach, the WTOization of the Community legis-\nlative engine represents a controversial realization and raises issues of both sub-\nstance and process. Regarding substance, opening up to a legal system with lower\nstandards of environmental protection, public health and labour laws, and a\ncomprehensive global membership represents a cause for concern.257 Moreover, it\nhas been argued that the normative subordination of the Community to the WTO\nis destined to put the European social model at risk.258 The concerns raised are\nexacerbated by the dramatic change in the European Union\u2019s economic and pol-\nitical architecture resulting from its enlargement.259\nMore importantly, regarding process, are we convinced that the WTO is better\nsuited for the European Union than its own law-making processes, a result of no\nlittle effort, compromise and continuous debate?260 Issues of democracy, legit-\nimacy, and accountability are raised in this context too.261 The European Union\ndespite its more developed characteristics in this respect, still has a long way to\n253 Article 3.2 DSU.\n254 Rosas, supra note 1.\n255 See also Eeckhout, supra note 57 at p. 99.\n256 Rosas, supra note 72 at p. 144.\n257 But see, Marco M.

What is increasingly worrying is the impression given by\nthe Commission that it treats WTO law as the \u2018supreme law\u2019. The substantive\nfalseness of this approach regardless, the absence of any public debate at the for-\nmulation of WTO rules \u2013 instead, the single undertaking procedure is followed in\nthe multilateral rounds of trade negotiations \u2013 , the limited role reserved to the\nEuropean Parliament at the negotiation and conclusion of the agreement on behalf\nof the European Union, and the fact that dispute settlement takes place behind\nclosed doors,264 indicate that there is less likelihood for WTO law to be received\nwith enthusiasm. The position of the Commission is inherently paradoxical, as the\nCommission itself has identified the need for increase in legitimacy and account-\nability within the European Union context.265\nConclusions\nAs Trachtman put it \u2018the question of direct effect is a political decision\u2019.266 The\nCommunity Treaties, along with the Council Decision concluding the WTO\nAgreement, represent the authentic political statement by theMember States on the\nissue of WTO law. The Court has appropriately responded and dismissed the calls\nfrom commentators to undervalue the normative merit of the relevant clause in\nthe Council Decision concluding the WTO Agreement.267 If the combined inter-\npretation of the case law, the legislative activity and the institutional practice\nmeans that the Community legal order is a dualist one for the purposes of\nthe application of WTO law, then so be it.268 Following from this, unless\nthe Community transforms WTO law into the Community legal system by means\nof transposition into its own legislative instruments, WTO law cannot have\ndirect effect. Hermeneutically, this means that the Community chose WTO law as\na second best set of rules. In its internal policy-making, it uses WTO law as a\nbenchmark and accepts its primacy in its commercial policy instruments.\nOrdinarily, it tries to interpret legislation consistently with the WTO Agreements.\n262 A.

Wincott (eds.), Accountability and Legitimacy in the European Union (Oxford\nUniversity Press, 2003).\n263 The disaffection towards the European Union looming in manyMember States and made manifest\nin the recent French and Dutch referenda is illustrative of this proposition.\n264 Which is not reversed by the groundbreaking decision to hold the proceedings in public in WT\/\nDS320 US \u2013 Continued suspension of obligations in the EC \u2013 Hormones dispute ; WT\/DS321\nCanada \u2013 Continued suspension of obligations in the EC \u2013 Hormones dispute.\n265 White Paper on European Governance, COM(2001)428, 25 July 2001.\n266 Joel Trachtman, \u2018Bananas, direct effect and compliance\u2019 (1999) 10 European Journal of\nInternational Law 655 at p. 664.\n267 Consequently, it is not the Court playing a political role as Klabbers suggested, supra note 4 at\np. 298.\n268 Eeckhout, supra note 27 at pp. 24\u201329.\n86 ANTON I S ANTON IAD I S\nApart from those exceptions, which do not, in essence, involve the application of\nWTO law but its communitarized version, WTO law may not be invoked in the\nCommunity and national courts, predominantly so if it is to challenge Community\nlegislation. In the external relations of the Community, WTO law may serve as a\nparticularly useful benchmark. The use of WTO norms in the material provisions\nof the Community\u2019s international agreements will facilitate trade liberalization\nand will have a positive impact on the establishment of a level-playing inter-\nnational trading field.\nIn sum, the analysis of the case law and institutional practice leads to the con-\nclusion that the Community possesses a finely tuned system for the application of\nWTO law, which is the result of the interaction between the Court and the political\ninstitutions. It is not as receptive to WTO law as some commentators would pre-\nfer, but neither as inconsistent as often accused. Until significant changes within\nthe WTO and its law-making mechanism materialize to enable WTO law to play a\nmore important role, this elaborate nexus of approaches should be considered as\nthoroughly satisfactory.\nThe European Union and WTO law 87\n\n"}
