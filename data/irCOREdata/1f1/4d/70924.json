ATR then phosphorylates and activates \nthe Chk1 kinase. The pathway leading from activated ATR to \nChk1 is complex and involves numerous intermediaries. In fi s-\nsion yeast, activation of Chk1 by the ATR homologue Rad3 re-\nquires, amongst other factors, Rad9, Crb2, and Cut5. Cut5 plays \na central role in transducing the checkpoint signal from acti-\nvated Rad3 to Chk1, as it forms complexes with both Crb2 and \nRad9 (for review see Garcia et al., 2005). In metazoans, Chk1 \nactivation also requires ATR, Rad9, and the Cut5 homologue \nTopBP1\/Mus101. Despite this conservation, there is an impor-\ntant difference between the fi ssion yeast and metazoan Chk1 \n activation pathways. In metazoans, the Claspin protein plays an \nessential role in Chk1 activation (Kumagai and Dunphy, 2000), \nwhereas in fi ssion yeast the Claspin homologue Mrc1 is not \n involved (Tanaka and Russell, 2001). Likewise, in fi ssion yeast, \nCrb2 is essential for Chk1 activation (Saka et al., 1997), whereas \nin metazoans the Crb2 homologue 53BP1 is not known to be in-\nvolved. Because Crb2\/53BP1 is not required for Chk1 activation \nin metazoans, it is unclear what role, if any, TopBP1\/Mus101 \nplays in promoting activation of Chk1 by ATR.\nCut5\/TopBP1 is unique amongst Chk1 activators in that \nit is also essential for DNA replication (Garcia et al., 2005). \nThis is an important feature of Cut5\/TopBP1, as replication is \nrequired to generate the DNA structures that activate ATR and \ninitiate the checkpoint response (Michael et al., 2000). In fi s-\nsion yeast, temperature-sensitive alleles of Cut5 have allowed \na separation of the replication and checkpoint functions of \nthe protein (Garcia et al., 2005); however, it is not yet known \nif the replication function can be uncoupled from checkpoint \nfunction for TopBP1. One recent study of the Xenopus laevis \nTopBP1 homologue Xmus101 (also known as Xcut5) showed \nthat Xmus101 is required to recruit both ATR and DNA poly-\nmerase \u03b1 (pol \u03b1) to chromatin during a checkpoint response \n(Parrilla-Castellar and Karnitz, 2003). Pol \u03b1 is required to gen-\nerate the DNA structures that activate ATR (Michael et al., \n2000), and it is therefore possible that the role of Xmus101 in \nChk1 activation is limited to this early phase of the process. \nDirect requirement for Xmus101 in ATR-mediated \nphosphorylation of Claspin bound Chk1 during \ncheckpoint signaling\nShan Yan,1 Howard D.

The \ndifferences in the mechanism of this signal relay between fi s-\nsion yeast and metazoans preclude clear predictions about what \nrole, if any, Xmus101 might play in promoting phosphorylation \nof Chk1 by ATR. To address this important issue, we have used \nconditions in X. laevis egg extracts that bypass the requirement \nfor pol \u03b1 and for generating DNA structures in activating Chk1. \nWe report on the role that Xmus101 plays in Chk1 activation \nunder these bypass conditions. Our results demonstrate that \nXmus101 has a late checkpoint function, to promote phosphor-\nylation of Chk1 by activated ATR.\nResults and discussion\nAT70-mediated Chk1 activation\nTo study Chk1 activation, we used the AT70 system in X. laevis \negg extracts (Kumagai and Dunphy, 2000). In this system, two \nshort oligonucleotides, A70 and T70, are annealed to one \n another and then added to extracts. Addition of the duplex, but \nnot either single oligonucleotide alone, triggers robust Chk1 \nphosphorylation. Chk1 activation in this system is dependent \non ATR, Claspin, and other checkpoint proteins (Kumagai and \nDunphy, 2000, 2003; Jeong et al., 2003). To monitor checkpoint \nactivation, we used a previously established assay based on a \nfragment of the X. laevis Chk1 protein, Chk1\u2206KD, that is phos-\nphorylated in an ATR- and Claspin-dependent manner in egg \nextracts (Michael et al., 2000; Jeong et al., 2003). Phosphoryla-\ntion of Chk1\u2206KD results in an easily detectable mobility shift \non SDS-PAGE gels. An example of the AT70 checkpoint system \nis shown in Fig. 1 A. Egg extracts were supplemented with \nChk1\u2206KD and either the single A70 oligonucleotide, the AT70 \nduplex, or no DNA at all. After a 100-min incubation, samples \nwere taken and probed by immunoblotting for Chk1\u2206KD. \nA Chk1\u2206KD mobility shift was observed in the samples con-\ntaining AT70 (Fig. 1 A, lane 3) but not in the sample containing \nA70 (lane 2) or no DNA (lane 1). This demonstrates that \nAT70  specifi cally triggers Chk1\u2206KD phosphorylation. \n Control  experiments, detailed in the supplemental text (available \nat http:\/\/www.jcb.org\/cgi\/content\/full\/jcb.200601076\/DC1), \nshowed conclusively that Chk1\u2206KD is a reliable surrogate for \nthe endogenous Chk1 in these assays (Fig. S1).\nXmus101, but not minichromosome \nmaintenance (MCM) complex or pol \ud835\udec2, \nis required for Chk1 activation \nin the AT70 system\nPrevious work has shown that when sperm chromatin and the \nDNA replication inhibitor aphidicolin are used to activate the \ncheckpoint in egg extracts, both the MCM complex and pol \u03b1 \nare required for Chk1 activation (Michael et al., 2000). Both of \nthese proteins promote replication (for review see Bell and \nDutta, 2002). The MCM complex is a hexameric assembly that \nunwinds DNA during replication, whereas pol \u03b1 synthesizes the \nprimers that initiate replication. To determine whether these \nproteins are required for Chk1 activation in the AT70 system, \nwe removed MCM and pol \u03b1 by immunodepletion. Fig. 1 B \nshows that all detectable MCM5 protein was removed from the \nextract, and Fig. 1 C shows that same was true of the p70 sub-\nunit of pol \u03b1. Despite the loss of MCM and pol \u03b1 in these ex-\ntracts, addition of AT70 still activated Chk1, as shown by \nChk1\u2206KD mobility shift (Fig. 1 D). MCM and pol \u03b1 are thus \ndispensable for Chk1 activation in the AT70 system. We con-\nclude that the AT70 system bypasses the requirement for repli-\ncation proteins in Chk1 activation.\nIf the role of Xmus101 in Chk1 activation was restricted \nto generating the checkpoint-activating DNA structure, then it, \nlike MCM and pol \u03b1, should be dispensable for Chk1 activation \nin the AT70 system. To address this, Xmus101 was removed \nfrom extract by immunodepletion (Fig. 1 E) and the samples \nFigure 1. Xmus101 is required, but replication proteins are not, for Chk1 \nactivation in the AT70 system. (A) Recombinant Chk1\u2206KD was added to \nextract, along with no DNA (lane 1), the A70 oligonucleotide (lane 2), or \nthe preannealed AT70 oligonucleotide (lane 3). After a 100-min incuba-\ntion, samples were taken and the phosphorylation status of Chk1\u2206KD was \nassessed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with the T7 monoclonal anti-\nbody (Novagen), which recognizes the T7 epitope tag present on recombi-\nnant Chk1\u2206KD. The retarded mobility of Chk1\u2206KD in lane 3 is due to \nphosphorylation (Michael et al., 2000). (B) MCM5 was immunodepleted \nfrom egg extract. The depleted extract was probed for MCM5 by immuno-\nblotting and compared with a mock-depleted extract. (C) Same as B except \nthat the p70 subunit of pol \u03b1 was immunodepleted. (D) Mock-depleted and \ndepleted extracts were supplemented with recombinant Chk1\u2206KD and \nAT70. After a 100-min incubation, samples were taken and processed as \nin A. The lanes labeled \u201cno DNA\u201d refer to extracts incubated without AT70 \nbut with recombinant Chk1\u2206KD. (E) Xmus101 was immunodepleted from \negg extracts. The depleted extracts were probed for Xmus101 by immuno-\nblotting and compared with a mock-depleted extract. Add-back refers \n to Xmus101-depleted extracts supplemented with recombinant Xmus101. \n(F) The extracts depicted in E were assayed for Chk1\u2206KD phosphorylation \nas in A.\n o\nn\n June 10, 2008 \nw\nw\nw\n.jcb.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n Published April 17, 2006\nXMUS101 IN CHECKPOINT CONTROL \u2022 YAN ET AL. 183\nwere assayed for Chk1 activation after addition of AT70. As \nshown in Fig. 1 F, and in contrast to MCM and pol \u03b1, removal \nof Xmus101 prevented Chk1\u2206KD phosphorylation. Impor-\ntantly, Chk1 activation was restored in Xmus101-depleted ex-\ntract after supplementation of the extract with recombinant \nXmus101 that had been produced in rabbit reticulocyte lysates \n(Fig. 1 F). Supplementation of Xmus101-depleted extract with \nunprogrammed reticulocyte lysates did not rescue Chk1\u2206KD \nphosphorylation (unpublished data). We conclude that Xmus101 \nis essential for Chk1 activation in the AT70 system. This result \nthus distinguishes Xmus101 from the replication fork com-\nponents MCM and pol \u03b1 and demonstrates that the role of \nXmus101 in Chk1 activation extends beyond generating the \ncheckpoint-activating DNA structure.\nA neutralizing antibody and a dominant-\nnegative fragment inhibit Xmus101 \nfunction during Chk1 activation\nWe considered the possibility that our anti-Xmus101 antibody, \nHU142, might inhibit Xmus101 function when added to extract. \nTo test this, we added purifi ed HU142 antibody directly to ex-\ntract along with AT70. Addition of HU142 prevented AT70-\n induced phosphorylation of Chk1\u2206KD, whereas nonspecifi c IgG \ndid not (Fig. 2 B). This result demonstrates that HU142, which \nrecognizes the COOH-terminal 333 amino acids of Xmus101 \n(Fig. 2 A), blocks AT70-mediated checkpoint signaling. One \nexplanation for this is that binding of HU142 to the COOH-\n terminal 333 amino acids of Xmus101 prevents an interaction \nbetween this region and a factor that is required for checkpoint \nsignaling. If so, then we might expect overexpression of the \n isolated 333 amino acid domain to also inhibit Chk1 activation \nthrough sequestration of this presumptive factor away from the \nfull-length endogenous Xmus101. To test this, we titrated a re-\ncombinant protein consisting of GST fused to the 333 COOH-\nterminal amino acids of Xmus101 (GST-CT333; Fig. 2 A) into \nextracts and then added AT70 to activate Chk1. As shown in \nFig. 2 C, addition of GST-CT333, but not GST alone, inhibited \nChk1\u2206KD phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner. We \nconclude that when the function of the extreme COOH terminus \nof endogenous Xmus101 is antagonized, through either binding \nof HU142 or overexpression of the isolated domain, then Chk1 \nactivation is blocked.\nIdentifi cation of the Xmus101-dependent \nstep in Chk1 activation\nThe results in Figs. 1 and 2 show that loss of Xmus101 blocks \nAT70-mediated Chk1 activation and that two independent in-\nhibitors of Xmus101, a neutralizing antibody and a dominant-\nnegative fragment, do the same. We next used these inhibitors \nto defi ne the Xmus101-dependent step in Chk1 activation. \nIn X. laevis, Chk1 activation is (minimally) a three-step process \n(Fig. 3 A). Upon ATR activation, the fi rst identifi able step is \nphosphorylation of the Claspin Chk1 binding domain (CKBD; \nKumagai and Dunphy, 2003). This phosphorylation is ATR de-\npendent and thus also serves as an indicator of ATR activation. \nAfter Claspin CKBD phosphorylation, the next step (step 2) is \nassembly of a Claspin\u2013Chk1 complex. Claspin\u2013Chk1 complex \nassembly is dependent on step 1 and is required for step 3 in the \nFigure 2.

After a 100-min incubation, samples were taken \nand probed for Chk1\u2206KD as in Fig. 1 A.\nFigure 3.

After a 100-min incuba-\ntion, the beads were isolated and washed, and bound proteins were eluted \nwith 2\u00d7 SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The presence of Claspin and Xchk1-GH \nin the eluate was then determined by immunoblotting with antibodies \nagainst Claspin and GST, respectively (Jeong et al., 2003).

To assay for completion of step 1, CKBD phos-\nphorylation, we used a fragment of Claspin corresponding to \nthe CKBD and assessed its phosphorylation by mobility shift on \nSDS-PAGE according to published procedures (Kumagai and \nDunphy, 2003). The GST-Claspin CKBD did not undergo a \n mobility shift in extracts that lacked DNA, nor did it shift in ex-\ntracts containing just the A70 oligonucleotide; however, we did \ndetect a shift in extracts containing AT70 (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1\u20133). \nInterestingly, the GST-Claspin CKBD mobility shift occurred \n normally in extracts containing both AT70 and HU142 (Fig. \n3 B, lane 4). This result shows that although HU142 prevents \nAT70-mediated Chk1\u2206KD phosphorylation, it has no effect on \nCKBD phosphorylation.\nWe next determined whether step 2, assembly of a Claspin\u2013\nChk1 complex, occurs in extracts containing Xmus101 inhibi-\ntors. For this, we used a previously published Claspin Chk1 \nbinding assay (Jeong et al., 2003; Kumagai and Dunphy, 2003). \nA full-length GST- and His-tagged Chk1 protein (Xchk1-GH) \nwas coupled to Ni\u2013nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) agarose beads, \nand the beads were then added to extracts. After a 100-min in-\ncubation, the beads were recovered, washed, and probed for the \npresence of Claspin by immunoblotting. A Claspin\u2013Chk1 com-\nplex could be detected specifi cally in extracts that had activated \nthe checkpoint through addition of AT70 (Fig. 3 D, lane 3) and \nwas not detected in extracts lacking DNA or containing A70 \n(Fig. 3 D, lanes 1 and 2). Importantly, the Claspin\u2013Chk1 com-\nplex readily formed in extracts containing both AT70 and \nHU142 (Fig. 3 D, lane 4). These data demonstrate that HU142 \ninhibits the ATR-dependent phosphorylation of Chk1 but not \nassembly of a Claspin\u2013Chk1 complex.\nTo confi rm the results obtained with HU142, we repeated \nthe experiments with an independent inhibitor of Xmus101 \nfunction, the recombinant GST-CT333 protein. Despite the \nability of GST-CT333 to prevent phosphorylation of Chk1 (Fig. \n2 C), it had no effect on either mobility shift of GST-Claspin \nCKBD or formation of a Claspin\u2013Chk1 complex (Fig. 3, C \nand E). These results are fully consistent with those obtained with \nHU142 and demonstrate that although the COOH terminus of \nXmus101 is required for Chk1 phosphorylation, it is not  required \nfor the ATR-dependent assembly of a Claspin\u2013Chk1 complex. \nWe conclude that one position of Xmus101 in the checkpoint \nactivation pathway is after assembly of the Claspin\u2013Chk1 \n complex and before phosphorylation of Chk1 by ATR.\nA separation-of-function mutant \nof Xmus101\nThe results presented thus far show that Xmus101 plays a direct \nrole in AT70-mediated Chk1 activation. To see if this is also true \nwhen checkpoint activation occurs under more physiological \nconditions, we examined the role of Xmus101 in Chk1 activation \nby replication-blocked sperm chromatin templates. Under these \nconditions, Xmus101 is required for replication fork assembly; \nthus, depletion of Xmus101 would indirectly affect Chk1 activa-\ntion by virtue of a failure to generate DNA structures. To get \naround this, we asked if we could separate the replication and \ncheckpoint functions of Xmus101 mutationally. We constructed \na deletion mutant of Xmus101 named Mini Xmus101 or Mini \n(Fig. 4 A). Mini corresponds to the fi rst 759 amino acids of the \nprotein and thus lacks the COOH-terminal 333 amino acids that \nhave been implicated in Chk1 activation. Endogenous Xmus101 \nwas immunodepleted, and the depleted extracts were supple-\nmented with rabbit reticulocyte lysates that had been programmed \nfor in vitro transcription\/translation reactions using constructs \nencoding either full-length Xmus101 or Mini. Fig. 4 B shows \nthat the full-length Xmus101 and Mini were produced to an \nequivalent extent in the rabbit reticulocyte lysates. The reconsti-\ntuted extracts were supplemented with sperm chromatin and \n\u03b1-[32P]dATP, and replication of the sperm chromatin was \n assessed. Supplementation of depleted extract with either full-\nlength Xmus101 or Mini rescued the replication defect com-\npletely, whereas add-back of unprogrammed reticulocyte lysates \ndid not promote replication (Fig. 4 C). We conclude that all of the \nreplication functions of Xmus101 are contained within Mini.\nBecause Mini was competent for DNA replication, \nwe asked whether it was also suffi cient for Chk1 activation. \nFigure 4. A separation-of-function mutant of Xmus101. (A) Schematic \nrepresentations of full-length Xmus101 and Mini. (B) Constructs encoding \neither full-length Xmus101 (FL) or Mini were transcribed and translated in \nvitro in rabbit reticulocyte lysates in the presence of [35S]methionine. The \nradio-labeled proteins were then run out on SDS-PAGE and visualized after \nautoradiography. (C) Xmus101 was depleted from egg extract. Depleted \nextract was then supplemented (0.1 vol) with either unprogrammed reticu-\nlocyte lysates (Xmus101\u2212) or lysates expressing either FL or Mini Xmus101. \nA mock-depleted sample was also prepared. The reconstituted extracts \nwere then combined with sperm chromatin and \u03b1-[32P]dATP, and DNA rep-\nlication was measured according to standard procedures (Walter and \nNewport, 1999). Samples were taken at 30, 60, and 90 min for analysis. \n(D) The reconstituted extracts described in C were supplemented with \nsperm chromatin and the DNA replication inhibitor aphidicolin (100 \u03bcg\/ml). \nAfter a 60-min incubation, the samples were probed by immunoblotting for \nboth activated and total Chk1.\n o\nn\n June 10, 2008 \nw\nw\nw\n.jcb.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n Published April 17, 2006\nXMUS101 IN CHECKPOINT CONTROL \u2022 YAN ET AL. 185\nTo examine this, we added sperm chromatin and the DNA poly-\nmerase inhibitor aphidicolin to extracts that had been immuno-\ndepleted of Xmus101 and supplemented with either full-length \nXmus101 or Mini. Chk1 activation was then monitored by im-\nmunoblotting of the extracts with antibodies specifi cally recog-\nnizing Chk1 that had been phosphorylated on serine 344. Serine \n344\u2013phosphorylated Chk1 represents the activated form (Guo \net al., 2000). As shown in Fig. 4 D, depletion of Xmus101 pre-\nvented Chk1 activation, and this was restored by add-back of \nfull-length Xmus101. Importantly, add-back of Mini did not res-\ncue Chk1 activation (Fig. 4 D). These data show that Mini is rep-\nlication competent and Chk1 activation defi cient. Based on the \nability of Mini to separate the replication and Chk1 functions of \nXmus101, we conclude that Xmus101 functions directly in Chk1 \nactivation, independent of its role in replication fork assembly.\nIn a fi nal experiment, we sought to connect the function \nof Xmus101 in Chk1 activation to the checkpoint response that \nprevents mitosis when replication is blocked. For this, we used \ncycling egg extracts, which when treated with aphidicolin are \nprevented from entering mitosis in a checkpoint-dependent \nmanner (Dasso and Newport, 1990). Mitosis was assessed by \nexamining sperm nuclei for nuclear envelope breakdown, as \n described previously (Murray, 1991). Addition of aphidicolin \ndelayed mitosis, as expected (Fig. 5 A). Importantly, this delay \nwas reversed by addition of the Xmus101 inhibitor HU142 (Fig. \n5 A). HU142 was as effective as the known checkpoint inhibitor \ncaffeine in releasing the checkpoint-mediated arrest. Addition of \nHU142 to interphase extracts had no adverse effect on DNA \nreplication (Fig. 5 B). We conclude that Xmus101 is required for \nboth Chk1 activation and for the checkpoint-mediated delay in \nentrance into mitosis when replication is blocked. Together with \nprevious work (Parrilla- Castellar and Karnitz, 2003), the results \npresented here demonstrate that Xmus101 has at least two func-\ntions during a checkpoint response: it acts early to recruit ATR \nand pol \u03b1 to damaged DNA and it functions later to promote \nphosphorylation of Claspin bound Chk1 by activated ATR. The \nchallenge for future studies will be to determine the exact mech-\nanism whereby Xmus101 performs this late function.\nMaterials and methods\nExtracts and extract procedures\nX. laevis egg extract preparation and DNA replication analysis were \n performed as described previously (Walter and Newport, 1999). For the \nexperiment shown in Fig. 5 A, cycling extracts were used, and they were \nprepared as described previously (Murray, 1991). For immunodepletion of \nXmus101, affi nity-purifi ed HU142 antibody was cross-linked to protein A\u2013\nSepharose beads (GE Healthcare) using the dimethylpimelimidate direct-\ncoupling method, as described previously (Harlow and Lane, 1988). \nImmunodepletion was then performed as described previously (Van Hatten \net al., 2002). Immunodepletion of pol \u03b1 has been described (Stokes and \nMichael, 2003), and immunodepletion of MCM5 was performed in an \nanalogous manner. A70 and AT70 oligonucleotides were added to 50 \nng\/\u03bcl of extract, and the phosphatase inhibitor tautomycin was included, \nat 3 \u03bcM, as previously described (Kumagai and Dunphy, 2000). For \nChk1\u2206KD shift assays, a bacterially expressed recombinant Chk1\u2206KD \nwas added, to 400 nM, to extracts and then visualized on immunoblots \n using a T7 monoclonal antibody (Novagen). GST-Claspin CKBD shift assays \nwere performed by adding bacterially expressed GST-Claspin CKBD (fi nal \nconcentration: 50 ng\/\u03bcl) to extract followed by visualization with anti-GST \nantibody (GE Healthcare; Kumagai and Dunphy, 2003). The Claspin\u2013\nChk1 interaction assay was performed exactly as described previously \n(Jeong et al., 2003).\nExpression vectors\nXmus101 BRCT 1\u20138 (FL) corresponds to full-length Xmus101 (nucleotides \n1\u20134542) subcloned into pCS2 + MT. Mini corresponds to Xmus101 nucle-\notides 1\u20132277 subcloned into pCS2 + MT. For transcription\/translation \nin vitro, a TNT SP6 Quick Master Mix kit (Promega) was used in all cases. \nChk1\u2206KD has been described (Michael et al., 2000). GST-Claspin CKBD \nwas produced by subcloning X. laevis Claspin nucleotides 2609\u20132779 \ninto pGEX-4T-1. Xchk1-GH has been described previously (Kumagai and \nDunphy, 2000). GST-CT333 was produced by subcloning Xmus101 \n nucleotides 3540\u20134542 into pGEX-4T-1.\nRecombinant proteins\nChk1\u2206KD was expressed as a His-tagged fusion protein in Escherichia coli \nand purifi ed over nickel NTA agarose according to standard procedures. \nRecombinant Xchk1-GH was produced via infection of Sf9 insect cells. \n Purifi cation of Xchk1-GH over a nickel NTA agarose column was performed \nas described previously (Kumagai and Dunphy, 2000). GST, GST-Claspin \nCKBD, and GST-CT333 were expressed in E. coli and purifi ed over gluta-\nthione agarose according to standard procedures.\nAntibodies\nThe anti-Xmus101 HU142 antibody and its affi nity purifi cation have been \ndescribed (Van Hatten et al., 2002). Antibodies against the p70 subunit \nof pol \u03b1 have been described (Stokes and Michael, 2003). Antibodies \nagainst Claspin were produced by W. Dunphy (California Institute of \n Technology, Pasadena, CA). Antibodies against Chk1 and serine 344\u2013\nphosphorylated Chk1 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., \nand Cell Signaling Technology, respectively. Antibodies against MCM5 \nwere obtained from Bethyl Laboratories.\nOnline supplemental material\nFigure S1 shows that Chk1\u2206KD is a reliable surrogate for endogenous \nChk1 in the AT70 checkpoint system.
