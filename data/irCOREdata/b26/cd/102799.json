In this paper, we therefore introduce \nthe concept of a radio enabler for reconfiguration \nmanagement, as envisaged within the IEEE P1900.4 working \ngroup [4]. All devices can listen to and likely transmit upon \nthis radio enabler in order to obtain\/convey reconfiguration \nmanagement and associated information in as efficient a \nmanner as possible. \nAmong the many uses for this envisaged radio enabler, \ndevices might receive context information (including, for \nexample, information about connectivity options upon start-\nup) far more efficiently, just by listening to a single channel \ninstead of having to scan among multiple network pilots. As \nother benefits, reconfiguration processes can be coordinated \namong affected elements, the transferal of policies\/directives \nand decisions related to a reconfiguration can be expedited or \nindeed made possible, and dynamic spectrum allocation \ntechnologies ensuing from reconfiguration, such as cognitive \nradio, can be facilitated through knowledge transferal (e.g. \nabout spectrum usage) among heterogeneous devices and \nnetwork elements. To summarize, we see this radio enabler as \nbeing an essential component for future reconfigurable devices \nand network elements, and as being an important facilitator for \ndynamic spectrum access procedures both through assisting \nreconfiguration processes and through benefiting associated \ntechnologies such as cognitive radio. \nThis paper is structured as follows. In the following section \nthe scene is set through introduction of the IEEE P1900.4 \nWorking Group and the context of the radio enabler building \nblock within this Working Group. In section 3, specifics on \nthe radio enabler are conveyed, including its basic structure \nthrough specification in start-up and ongoing information \nphases. Continuing the detail on the radio enabler, section 4 \nhighlights some constraints on it, and by necessity also some \nof its proposed technical characteristics.

THE IEEE P1900.4 WORKING GROUP \nThe purpose of the IEEE P1900.4 Working Group is to \ndefine architectural network and device elements and inherent \ninformation exchange between these elements, including \ninformation model representation, in order to facilitate \nreconfiguration management and the optimization of radio \nresource usage. This will lead to an improvement in overall \ncapacity, spectral efficiency, quality of service, and device \nutility. Distributed Decision Making (DDM) functionalities, \ncorresponding context and constraints information and \nprocedures, are essential for this work. It is intended for \naspects of DDM to be addressed at a later stage. \nWithin the context of this objective, Figure 1 illustrates the \nelements envisaged within P1900.4 for reconfiguration \nmanagement: The Network Reconfiguration Management \n(NRM) module, Terminal Reconfiguration Management \n(TRM) modules, and the Radio Enabler for reconfiguration \nmanagement. It is expected for there will be a single NRM \nmodule (or maybe a handful of NRMs) across networks, \nwhich is\/are able to deal with the functionalities highlighted in \nFigure 1, such as provision of directive\/recommended \nbehaviors to terminals dependent on their current context, as \nwell as the provision of context information related to \nconnectivity discovery, ongoing operation and optimization \n(e.g. changing context to satisfy QoS constraints), and \nreconfiguration possibilities. Several sources may provide \ninformation to the NRM modules, including operators, \nregulators, and manufacturers. The NRM will collect and \noperate on this information in order to derive precise \nguidance, such as contexts, policies and directives, to convey \nto terminals such that they know exactly the bounds within \nwhich they may operate, as well as the opportunities that are \nopen to them. \nA TRM module will exist in each terminal, and will take \ninputs from the terminal such as that related to the terminal\u2019s \ncapabilities as well as observed radio link quality and QoS, in \norder to assist in information provision such that networks can \ndecide upon a reconfiguration and\/or associated functionality \nsuch as a radio resource optimization, or the nature of \nconstraints that will be conveyed to terminals within which \nthey must operate. The radio enabler part simply provides the \nlink between the NRM and TRMs, where it is important to \nnote that this radio enabler must operate over many different \npossible air interfaces (air interfaces 1..n in Figure 1) and will \nlikely be assisted by bearers of the networks that the terminals \nare already using. Ultimately, it will also be partly provided \nover a means such as a harmonized broadcast channel\/RAT \nfor devices to listen to (air interface N in Figure 1). It is under \nfurther investigation whether this channel N should be a \nlogical channel or a novel physical channel. \nThe P1900.4 Working Group has identified two distinct \noperational phases for which the radio enabler will have a \ndifferent role: (a) the start-up phase, where a terminal is being \nswitched on or is in a new environment, and needs to learn \nabout available RATs in an efficient manner, and (b) the \nongoing phase, where the terminal is already in working mode \nfacing varying conditions, affecting e.g. QoS and radio \nresource availabilities, thus presenting various \nbenefits\/opportunities for reconfiguration of the RAT with \nwhich it is associated. \n \nAir Interface 1\nAir interface 2\nAir Interface n\nAir Interface N\nRadio Resources Directives\/\nRecommended Behaviors\nUsage Context Information\n\u2022-Discovery Mode\n\u2022Operational Mode\n\u2022Reconfiguration Mode\nSource 1\ne.g. Operator\nSource 2\ne.g. Regulator\nSource 3\ne.g. Manufacturer\nRadio Enabler\nLogical or Physical Channel\nDownlink Mandatory\nUplink Optional\/Highly Recommended\n1\nNetwork Reconfiguration \nManagement Module\nRadio Access Networks\nMultimode\/DSA Enabled devices\n2\nTerminal Reconfiguration \nManagement Module\nReception & Request\nA: Radio Resource Policies\nB: Context Information\nDistributed Decision\nMaking\nSecured Mechanisms\nDevice Capabilities\nUser Interactions \nwith respect to resource selection\n4\n5\n6\n3\n7\n8\n \nFigure 1: Overall plan of architectural elements envisaged in IEEE P1900.4 \n233\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Scenarios for Reconfiguration Management \nPertinent to the scope of P1900.4, the following scenarios \nfor reconfiguration management are envisaged. These are \nchosen as they cover the vast majority of eventualities which \nmight lead to reconfiguration and\/or associated resource \nreallocation being required: \n\u2022 Scenario 1: The network context changes, and users \nadapt to optimally use available resources, e.g., an \noperator adds\/removes RATs (the base station is \nno longer operational, etc.), \n\u2022 Scenario 2: The user context changes and remaining \nusers reconfigure\/adapt to optimally use available \nresources, e.g., users arrive\/leave an area, \n\u2022 Scenario 3: The user behavior changes and RATs on \nnetwork side are reconfigured to a different \nstandard, e.g., the network switches from WiMAX \n[5] to IEEE802.11n [6] if a large number of users \nare suddenly close to the base station. \nTo align these scenarios with a real-world situation, while \nemphasizing the significance of the radio enabler, they are \nhighlighted within the storyline sequence of events depicted in \nFigure 2: \n1. Figure 2(a): User \u2018A\u2019 switches on and looks for \navailable RATs (start-up context information is \nobtained via the radio enabler), \n2. Figure 2(b): User \u2018A\u2019 chooses its services \nautonomously: It targets a low-latency VoIP \ncommunication means in parallel with a high data-\nrate video streaming application, provided by the \n \n \n(a)                          (b) \n \n \n \n(c)                          (d) \n \n \n \n(e)                          (f) \n \n \n \n(g)                          (h) \n \nFigure 2: Storyline sequence of events emphasizing the context of the radio enabler within the P1900.4 working group \n234\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

This choice is made \nthrough analyzing start-up information obtained \nvia the radio enabler, \n3. Figure 2(c): At a later stage, user \u2018A\u2019, upon \nanalyzing its QoS, finds it insufficient. New \nparameters are chosen autonomously, resulting in \nuser \u2018A\u2019 connecting to the WiMAX and \nIEEE802.11n networks concurrently to receive its \nservices. This change is made through analyzing \nongoing information obtained via the radio \nenabler, \n4. Figure 2(d): User \u2018A\u2019 further adapts its parameter \nsets autonomously, targeting a better usage of \nresources. The new strategy, where an alternative \nIEEE802.11n network is used, turns out to be \noptimum. Again, this change is made through \nanalyzing ongoing information obtained via the \nradio enabler, \n5. Figure 2(e): Suddenly, new users arrive (user \ncontext changes) and the throughput of the \nIEEE802.11n connection of User \u2018A\u2019 decreases, \n6. Figure 2(f): The communication parameters are \nagain adapted autonomously by User \u2018A\u2019, and it \nconnects to the other IEEE802.11n network, \n7. Figure 2(g): Even more users arrive. In order to \noptimize network behavior, the network decides to \nchange the communication rules: the number of \nconnections is limited to one per user. This change \nin policy is communicated over the radio enabler, \nand users adapt to this new constraint, \n8. Figure 2(h): Several users linked to the \nIEEE802.11n access points (APs) move away from \nthe AP locations. As facilitated by the radio \nenabler, the network decides to reconfigure the AP \ntechnologies from IEEE802.11n to IEEE802.16 in \norder to provide wider coverage and maintain the \nconnections (the network context changes). \nIII. THE RADIO ENABLER BLOCK FOR RECONFIGURATION \nMANAGEMENT \nHaving introduced the scope and context of the radio \nenabler block, this section describes some of its possible \ncharacteristics in a technical realization. \nA. Structure of the Radio Enabler \nThe sub-building blocks in Figure 3 are intended to provide \na basis for future work on the radio enabler within P1900.4. \nThe upper block, \u201cMapping of information (protocols) on to \ndata transport channels,\u201d corresponds to using e.g. the \ninformation capabilities in an operator\u2019s existing network to \nconvey the enabler. The lower block, \u201cMapping of \ninformation (protocols) on to a channel dedicated to protocol \ninformation exchange,\u201d corresponds to the introduction of a \nnovel harmonized band for the radio enabler, either using a \ncurrent RAT or perhaps a novel one created for this purpose. \nThe radio enabler is anticipated to be conveyed in two parts: \nthat for start-up information, and that for ongoing information. \nThe start-up information, in most cases, corresponds to the \nlower block in Figure 3, whereas the ongoing information \ncorresponds to the upper one. Further detail on some special \ncases affecting these assumptions may nevertheless be inferred \nfrom the following paragraphs. \n \n \nFigure 3: Sub-building blocks of the radio enabler \nCharacteristic Start-up Phase Ongoing Phase \nInformation conveyed Start-up information, e.g. context \ninformation on available networks at that \nlocation \nOngoing information, e.g. much \nmore detailed context information, \npolicies for reconfiguration \nmanagement, feedback \nmeasurements, etc. \nChannel bitrate Relatively low bitrate per location area. \nHowever, channel bitrate must be \nrelatively high in general to cover a large \nnumber of location areas and to cover a \nlarge broadcast area \nRelatively high bitrate, dependent \non the bearer being used \nData direction Downlink. Probably does not include \nuplink, although this is under further \ninvestigation \nDownlink. Almost certainly \nincludes uplink as well \nBearer Most likely a harmonised frequency \nband, wide-area coverage. Might be a \nnovel RAT, or a legacy technology of \nappropriate characteristics (to be \ndecided) \nA bearer in a operator\u2019s network \n(e.g. a UMTS bearer) \n \nTable  1: Start-up and ongoing phases of the radio enabler, and associated characteristics \n235\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on May 06,2010 at 10:46:51 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. \n The expected characteristics of the start-up and ongoing \nparts of the enabler are indicated in some detail in Table 1. \nUnder a significant proposal being considered for possible \nimplementation, the start-up information provision is defined \nas being a wide-area coverage resource which either uses a \nnew radio interface, or perhaps uses a legacy technology of \nappropriate characteristics (e.g. possibly DVB). In both cases \nit is anticipated for the start-up part to convey information on \nsome form of harmonized band, although importantly, this \npart is not provided by bearers from a frequency band of an \noperator\u2019s legacy system\u2014for this reason it is often referred to \nas \u201cout-band\u201d. Information from the start-up part may, \nhowever, be copied to the operators\u2019 dedicated channels for \nthe purpose of terminals listening to the radio enabler on a \nlast-registered network, without having to switch to the \nP1900.4 dedicated (harmonized) band every time they power \nup. Moreover, in some distinct cases it might be feasible to \nalso mirror such start-up information through other means, for \nexample through a location-specific logical channel using an \nexisting Internet connection. Such solutions will further \nenhance the scope of the enabler. \nAll terminals can immediately listen to the start-up part at \nany instance necessary to obtain vital information, where this \ninformation is anticipated to be location-dependent. It is \nexpected for this part to cyclically broadcast start-up \ninformation to devices (e.g. available networks at that \nlocation), although due to it being on a different \nfrequency\/RAT from the other bearers the device will use, it is \nunlikely that it will be used for ongoing reconfiguration \nmanagement information. Hence once the start-up information \nis obtained, it is anticipated that the device will switch to the \nongoing part, and in this process will discontinue reception of \nthe start-up part in order to avoid the need to listen to more \nthan one frequency\/RAT alternately or concurrently. \nThe ongoing part is anticipated to most-likely be provided \nby a bearer of an operator\u2019s network, and may simply be a \nlogical link. Different devices that are registered with different \nnetworks therefore utilize different bearers for the ongoing \npart. The ongoing part is obtained by a device first listening to \nthe start-up part then switching to the ongoing part within a \nnetwork it registers with, as selected from information about \nnetworks at that location specified in the start-up part. The \nongoing part is expected to provide a higher bitrate than the \nstart-up part, and importantly is much more likely to provide \nuplink as well as downlink information transfer. As well as \nconveying operational information to\/from terminals, the \nongoing part might also periodically transmit the information \nthat is given by the start-up part. This is so that terminals may \nstay camped on the ongoing part upon having a registered (or \nlast-registered) network, instead of having to periodically \nswitch (or concurrently listen to) the start-up part to ensure \nobtaining the complete information set. \nThrough this provision of start-up and ongoing radio \nenabler parts, the process a terminal will follow upon power-\nup is as in Figure 4. Moreover, the state diagram for network \nselection, including the important possibility of terminals \nmaintaining information on last-registered networks, is as in \nFigure 5. \nIV. TECHNOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS ON, AND \nCHARACTERISTICS OF, THE RADIO ENABLER \nIn this section, the technological constraints on the radio \nenabler, and by necessity some of its further characteristics, \nare explained. \nA. Start-up Radio Enabler: Location Resolution vs. \nComplexity of Start-up Information and Data Rate \nFirst, a particular technical constraint related to the start-up \nradio enabler is considered. Here it is necessary to detail one \n \nFigure 4: Start-up process for a terminal using the radio enabler \n \n \n \nFigure 5: State diagram for network selection using the radio enabler \n236\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on May 06,2010 at 10:46:51 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. \n considered approach to the start-up radio enabler, as depicted \nin Figure 6. Information for a range of \u2018meshes\u2019 \n(corresponding to discrete coordinate areas) is broadcast to a \nwide area, and terminals extract the local list of existing radio \nsystems available per operator, for their \u2018mesh\u2019\u2014see e.g. \n[7],[8]. For each network operator, the preferred technologies \nare indicated as paired with the preferred frequencies to camp \non at start-up of the terminal. Hence through listening to the \nstart-up radio enabler the terminal extracts relevant \ninformation related to its geographical position, where its \ngeographical position is known in advance by means of a geo-\nlocation technology. The terminal then proceeds to select a \nnetwork accordingly. \nThe formatting of data on the start-up radio enabler can be \nbased on the assumption that a relatively limited number of \ntechnologies and networks are available within the radio \nenabler broadcast area. Hence each \u2018mesh\u2019 in this area will \njust need to point to a list of \u201cconnection configurations,\u201d \nupdated by each operator as depicted in the lower half of \nFigure 6. There is a trade-off of the amount of information that \ncan be conveyed in each \u2018mesh\u2019, with the size of \u2018meshes\u2019. In \nassessing this trade-off based on the aforementioned approach, \nand using Figure 7 for reference, the total start-up radio \nenabler content size (per period) is determined by \nnbConf\u00b7ConfSize+nbMeshes\u00b7(LocSize+nbConf). Noting that \nthe total number of \u2018meshes\u2019 nbMeshes is simply the broadcast \narea for the start-up radio enabler divided by the area of each \n\u2018mesh\u2019, thence performing calculations to the above effect, it \nbecomes clear that the scalability of this approach is \nappropriate for the representation of start-up information. \n \n \nFigure 6: A considered approach for the start-up radio enabler \n \nB. Start-up Radio Enabler: Data Reliability, Dependability, \nand Error Rate \nAn important constraint on the start-up radio enabler is the \nneed for data reliability. In many scenarios, it is essential for \nreceivers to know that the information they have received has \nnot been corrupted by the channel, such that they do not then \nact based on incorrect information. Some form of error \nchecking is therefore necessary on the start-up radio enabler, \nhence a checksum attributed to each chunk of data must be \ntransmitted on the start-up enabler, along with that data. Given \nthe use of such a checksum, there is still a small probability \nStart-up enabler\nbroadcast area\n\u2026\u2026\nf j,2,2T 2 \nf j,2,1T 1 O 2\nf j,1,2T 2 \nf j,1,1T 1 O 1\nM j\nf i,2,2T 2 \nf i,2,1T 1 O 2\nf i,1,2T 2 \nf i,1,1T 1 O 1\nM i\nFrequencyTechnology OperatorMesh\nR\nadio enabler \n \n\u2026\nOp4, techno4, freq6 \nOp3, techno2, freq5\nOp3, techno1, freq4\nOp2, techno1, freq3\nOp1, techno2, freq2\nOp1, techno1, freq1\n000\n100\n011\n000\n010\n011\n\u2026Mesh 3 locMesh 2 locMesh 1 loc\nNumber of meshes: nbMeshes\nNumber\nof lines = \nnbConf\nTriplet (op,techno,freq) information size: ConfSize\nNumber of \nused \nconfigurations \n=nbConf\nGeo-location information size: LocSize\n \n \nFigure 7: Information-per-period constraint on the out-band radio enabler \n237\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

In the light of \nthis, a reliability constraint on the radio enabler should specify \na probability that the received information is correct given a \nverified checksum. \nIn a similar vein to the above, dependability of information \nis also a concern for the start-up enabler. In this context, a \nconstraint here might be a certain \u201clevel of trust\u201d being \nattributed to the information. In order to improve security in \nthis context, a cryptographic hash function to generate a \nchecksum could provide a better solution than a cyclic \nredundancy check, due to the one-way property of \ncryptographic hash functions. Intensive further work on such \nsecurity for the start-up enabler however is needed. \nSomewhat related to the reliability and dependability of \ninformation on the start-up enabler, another constraint might \nbe a specified maximum error rate for the utilized information \nbearer, so as to minimize corruption of the conveyed \ninformation and to \u201cnip the problem in the bud\u201d. Means to \nreduce this error rate include the use of forward error \ncorrection in conjunction with interleaving, among others. The \nexact block size over which redundancy bits are calculated \ncould be considered as a constraint on the radio enabler in this \ncontext, where relevant factors affecting this constraint \ninclude the data overhead that the \u201ccoding rate\u201d implies for the \nlink, the latency involved in waiting for data to arrive for \nencoding\/decoding, and the coding processing requirement, \namong others. Returning to error detection in assessment of \nthe block size constraint over which such a calculation is done, \nrelevant factors in this case include minimization of the \nprobability of data being unnecessarily discarded (due to being \nin the same block as erroneous bits), the data\/processing \noverhead of the error detection calculation (these are in fact \nlikely to be small in most cases), and the way information is \nrepresented on the radio enabler. For instance, there is no logic \nin performing error detection on a per-\u2018mesh\u2019 basis (see Figure \n6), if the exact size of the \u2018mesh\u2019 or the definition of the exact \ninformation for the \u2018mesh\u2019 is represented by some kind of \ninheritance from other \u2018meshes\u2019 or other parts of the radio \nenabler data period. \nNote that as regards all of the above constraints on the radio \nenabler, for many legacy systems forward error correction and \ndata reliability\/dependability will already be provided for \naccording to the specification of the legacy system. Hence for \nthe purpose of conveying the start-up radio enabler using a \nlegacy system (e.g. DVB), it is simply a matter of matching \nthe start-up enabler requirements to those of the utilized \nsystem (logical channel), and bridging the gap. Given the \ncreation of a novel radio interface to convey the start-up \nenabler however, all of the above constraints must be \nincorporated into the design of that radio interface. \nC. Ongoing Radio Enabler \nConstraints on and technological characteristics of the \nongoing radio enabler in some respects match those of the \nstart-up enabler. For example, the \u201cdeltas\u201d between the legacy \ntechnologies being used for the ongoing enabler and \nrequirements for the enabler in term of reliability, \ndependability, error rate etc, must be bridged using higher-\nlevel mechanisms. It is likely that a small proportion of the \ninformation for the ongoing radio enabler must be the same \nfor all ongoing enablers (in different networks) at that \nlocation. A prime example of this is the need for the ongoing \nradio enabler to always convey all of the start-up information \nin addition to the ongoing information exchange. Hence it is \nanticipated that, as well as other constraints, there will be a \ncommon minimum acceptable data rate required of the \nongoing radio enablers, despite them being provided by \ndifferent networks. \nAnother constraint\/technical characteristic on the ongoing \nradio enabler is the need for an uplink. Whereas an uplink for \nthe start-up radio enabler will likely not be provided, for the \nongoing enabler an uplink is useful and is likely necessary to \nconvey various information to the NRM. Such information \nmight include, for example, reports on the QoS that terminals \nare experiencing in order for the NRM to initiate an \nappropriate reconfiguration\/optimization based on maximizing \nthe collective QoS for the system(s) in question. \nV. THE RADIO ENABLER AS A FACILITATOR FOR SECONDARY \nSPECTRUM USAGE \nWithin its wide range of possible applications, the radio \nenabler facilitates the secondary usage of licensed radio \nspectrum bands that are temporarily or locally unused, such \nthat more efficient spectrum occupancy may follow. There is a \nquite unexplored secondary market that could exploit such \nunused frequency bands, in both spatial and time domains. \nSome example cases in which such spectrum could be \nexploited are, e.g., wireless infrastructureless systems with \nlow cost receivers, communication of devices in personal area \nnetworks, etc. In these scenarios, the radio enabler is not only \nable to serve the cellular market but it also plays a key role in \ndiscovering unused frequency bands for cognitive radios. \nFocusing on the typical reconfigurable cognitive radio, the \nrequirement for safe secondary usage is first to discover the \nunused bands, then to take advantage of them provided that \nthey do not interfere or jam the primary market spectrum \nusers. In this sense, there is a set of both technical and \neconomical challenges to be faced to ensure feasible \ncoexistence of primary and secondary markets. These are \ndetailed as follows. \n1) The Radio Enabler Facilitating Fast Identification of \nUnused Frequency Bands. \nFor a reconfigurable terminal to operate in the secondary \nmarket, it should first detect spectrum holes. Any secondary \nreceiver attempting to scan the whole spectrum (which might \nhave a range of several GHz) to look for holes, would be very \ncomplex and would require a considerable scanning time, \nleading to it being a high-cost device. In such a scenario, the \nuse of a radio enabler to indicate, for each geographical region \n(i.e. each \u2018mesh\u2019), the frequencies available for secondary use, \nwould be extremely helpful to terminals. \n238\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Restrictions apply. \n 2) The Radio Enabler Facilitating Interference-Free \nOperation of the Secondary Market \nThe other users affected by this process, particularly \nprimary users, must trust in the satisfactory operation of the \nprocess such that they do not experience interference and their \nQoSs are not degraded. Furthermore, primary users must have \npreference in the usage of spectrum, with respect to secondary \nusers, but at the same time some minimum bandwidth for link \nmaintenance of the secondary users would be desirable. In this \ncontext, the radio enabler might avoid interference from \nsecondary users, because any secondary terminal would know \nafter radio enabler detection the specific frequencies that are \nbeing used in the mesh, even if it is not able to detect them due \nto, e.g., shadowing. Therefore, the hidden terminal effect can \nbe avoided by the radio enabler. As another possibility, \noperators owning spectrum bands could help in managing the \ninterference of secondary users by maintaining a precise \ndatabase for propagation prediction and interference, \ndependent on the specific network planning they have at each \nspecific time and region. From this database, the information \non frequencies available for secondary usage could easily be \nfed into the radio enabler.   \n3) The Radio Enabler Facilitating a Proper Business \nModel for the Secondary Market \nA non-regulated secondary use of spectrum, in which \nterminals autonomously decide the frequencies upon which \nthey can transmit, would not financially benefit the spectrum \nowners (e.g. operators). Hence operators might be reluctant to \nallow their bands to be secondary-used. However, the radio \nenabler provides a regulated framework for secondary usage, \nin the sense that owners of temporarily released frequency \nbands can be clearly identified by the spectrum regulator, such \nthat the regulator can economically promote the release of \nfrequency bands for the sake of improved spectrum usage. \nMoreover, stringent controls on terminals accessing the radio \nenabler for secondary usage could be enforced, to avoid \ninterference issues. Consequently, cellular operators could \nactually benefit from the secondary usage of their spectrum \nthrough the radio enabler. \n4) The Radio Enabler Facilitating Secondary Market \nDynamic Spectrum Allocation \nSubsections (1) to (3) have pointed out the need for a radio \nenabler allowing opportunistic secondary system usage (with \ncognitive radio capabilities, at the terminal side). Another \nsecondary spectrum usage scenario, albeit in a slightly \ndifferent context from the described enabler in previous \nsections, consists in two or more cellular networks, where \neach operator can temporally rent out dynamically some \nspectrum on a frequency carrier basis to some secondary \nneighboring cells. Depending on the spectrum need over the \ntime of the day, each BS can act as a primary or secondary \nsystem. The renting out or renting in related procedures \nbetween the primary and secondary BSs can be handled by \nover-the-air communications between BSs. These procedures \ncan be supported through a radio enabler. In that case of \napplication, from the primary BS perspective, the radio \nenabler could support information related to spectrum auction \nadvertisement, discovery, information related to negotiation \nprocess, radio resources scheduling information to allow \nseveral secondary BSs to enter simultaneously in \ncommunication with the primary BS, etc. On the other hand, \nfrom the secondary BS perspective, the radio enabler could be \na medium allowing the secondary BS to make a request for \ntemporally spectrum demand. Primary BS could hear this \nmessage and come into communications with the secondary \nBS if this primary BS is ready to rent out some spectrum. \nRegardless of the case aforementioned, this type of radio \nenabler could be implemented either in peer-to-peer between \nthe primary and secondary BSs, or indirectly by the use of \nbridging terminals filling the gap between two separated \nneighboring cells.  \nVI. CONCLUSION \nIn this paper, we have discussed the development of a radio \nenabler to assist reconfiguration management and ensuing \ntechnologies involving dynamic spectrum access. Such a radio \nenabler serves one of three building blocks defined in the \nIEEE P1900.4 Working Group, a standardization effort \nconceived to be a major link in the chain facilitating \nreconfiguration and resource optimization capabilities. \nThe detail presented on the radio enabler has highlighted its \ndivision into start-up and ongoing information provision \nphases, as well as some likely characteristics pertaining to the \ntechnical realization of these phases. Some technological \nconstraints on the radio enabler have also been presented, as \nwell as some specific use-cases for its operation involving \nnetwork selection, optimization, and secondary spectrum \nusage. \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \nThis work has been performed within the project E2RII, which has \nreceived funding from the European Community's Sixth Framework \nProgramme.
