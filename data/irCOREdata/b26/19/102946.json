Therefore, any inte-\ngrated approach to the understanding of gene expression\nin prokaryotic systems must consider operons as one of\nthe basic units, which are regulated by promoters, tran-\nscription factors and associated proteins. Although over\n500 bacterial genomes have been sequenced and microar-\nray-based expression studies are increasingly common,\ndefining and mapping operon structure is time-consum-\ning and complex, and the ability to predict them ab initio\nis therefore important. Since operon structure is fre-\nPublished: 12 February 2008\nBMC Genomics 2008, 9:79 doi:10.1186\/1471-2164-9-79\nReceived: 9 October 2007\nAccepted: 12 February 2008\nThis article is available from: http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/9\/79\n\u00a9 2008 Laing et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. \nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/2.0), \nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Page 1 of 15\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Genomics 2008, 9:79 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/9\/79quently unstable across species boundaries [2-8], most\napproaches have used non-homology based data to pre-\ndict operon structure. Besides predicted promoters and\nterminators, intergenic distance and expression data are\nalso often used in non-homology based operon predic-\ntion strategies with varying sensitivity [9-17]. However,\nsince there is generally limited data on known promoter\nlocations and\/or unreliable prediction methods, the iden-\ntification of promoters is often difficult and makes their\nuse problematic for operon prediction. In an attempt to\navoid the problems associated with prediction of promot-\ners it is worthwhile investigating the usefulness of other\nregulatory binding sites as potential predictors of operons,\nsomething not previously attempted.\nAside from promoters and terminators, transcription fac-\ntor binding plays a key role in controlling the expression\nlevel of a gene or group of genes. Therefore, to coordinate\nthe expression of genes within an operon a transcription\nfactor binding site (TFBS), just like promoters, should be\nfound predominantly upstream of the first gene in an\noperon; although there are a small number of reported\ncases of secondary binding sites within operons e.g. lac\noperon [18] and in our previous study [19], the tradi-\ntional, 'static' view of operons (a group or genes tran-\nscribed together in all conditions) is applied. Prokaryotic\ntranscription factors are usually deemed as either activa-\ntors or repressors (with some having a dual role) depend-\ning on the effect they have on the rate of transcription\ninitiation of the downstream gene(s). The dimeric nature\nof repressor and activator binding in prokaryotes requires\nthat a recognition site must be a dyad, and typically an\ninverted repeat [20,21]. This 'structure' of a binding\nsequence coupled with their typically short length (6\u201315\nbp) can be used to predict likely TFBSs themselves [21,22]\nand therefore if this can be done with confidence, can be\nused in the prediction of operonic gene pairs.\nTFBSs are often described as consensus sequences or regu-\nlar expressions that represent the most common sequence\nin a set of closely related binding site examples. Though\nsimple in their construction, such consensus sequences\nare unable to imitate the variability that exists within true\nTFBSs in nature, where some sites may tolerate a range of\nbases and retain function. When using simple regular\nexpressions, TFBS prediction is therefore dependent on\nthe amount of mismatches (if any) that are tolerated.\nDefining the best consensus sequence for predicting sites\nis also difficult [23]. Position Specific Weight Matrices\n(PSWMs), first used for the characterisation of translation\ninitiation sites [24] are an alternative to consensus\nsequences. The methods used to produce PSWMs differ\nmainly in the type of information used to collect a set of\nbinding site examples. For example, the identification of\nregulatory motifs which can be used to predict regulons,\ncommonly adopted after microarray data collection, uses\na set of co-regulated genes as a prerequisite [c.f. [25,26]].\nSimilarly, prior knowledge can be used where experimen-\ntal characterisation of a common regulatory binding site\nleads to the searching of upstream regions of the genes for\na similar motif [27]. Knowledge of protein structure has\nalso been applied to regulatory protein binding site iden-\ntification through binding energy calculations between\nnucleotide and amino acid (e.g. [28,29]). In this study\nhowever, we wished to develop a method applicable to\nStreptomyces coelicolor genomics and due to the relative\npaucity of comprehensive information on Streptomyces\ngene regulation an a priori method that is capable of pro-\nducing PSWMs is desirable. It will also support an operon\nprediction method that integrates data from various\nsources (e.g. intergenic distance [15] and\/or expression\ndata [14]) by increasing the amount of information about\nan operon whilst still being applied generically to all\nsequenced prokaryotic species without a dependency on\nthe availability of functional or structural information.\nOne such method was published by the Siggia group [22]\nwhich requires no prior knowledge, can in principle be\napplied to any genome, and can generate PSWMs of\ndyads. The algorithm has successfully been applied in E.\ncoli [22], B. subtilis [30] and additionally to S. coelicolor\n[31]. Here the published method [22] was implemented\nand applied in Escherichia coli and Streptomyces coelicolor.\nBy constructing PSWMs from over-represented words in a\ngiven data set it is possible to test the upstream regions of\ngenes for putative TFBSs. Based on the 'classical' definition\nof an operon [1] intra-operonic genes (excluding the first\ngene of an operon) should not have a TFBS in their\nupstream region. Although this is increasingly viewed as\noverly simplistic as an operon definition [11,19,32,33] it\nappears to hold for the large majority of operons in most\nconditions. Subsequently, adjacent gene pairs that have a\nTFBS in between them are not expected to be part of the\nsame operon. Using positive and negative examples of\ngenes which are considered to be operonic members, the\nuse of TFBSs as predictors of operons can be tested.\nPrior to this, the first part of this work characterises the\npalindromic tendency of footprints of known transcrip-\ntion factors in E. coli, a property which is later shown to\nimprove operon prediction in S. coelicolor. The second part\nof this work concentrates on developing a strategy of\nimplementing the Siggia group's algorithm [22] through\nthe use of different thresholds and examines the differ-\nences in results obtained. Comparisons with the previous\nTFBS set predicted in S. coelicolor [31] are also made.\nFinally the usefulness of TFBSs as predictors of operons in\nboth E. coli and S. coelicolor is discussed.Page 2 of 15\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Genomics 2008, 9:79 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/9\/79Methods\nMany methods are used to test the efficacy of TFBS at pre-\ndicting operons in this work, which are summarised in\nFigure 1.\nPSWM construction algorithm\nThe algorithm published by Li and co-workers [22] is\ncapable of taking any set of upstream sequences (referred\nto herein as UPSQs) and constructing PSWMs from signif-\nicantly over-represented dimers within this set. This\nmethod can be summarised by five steps:\n1) Counts of every possible dimer (D) of the form W1 Nx\nW2 where W1 and W2 are short oligonucleotides of length\n3\u20135 nt separated by x (0\u201330) arbitrary bases are collected\nfrom the UPSQs set. For each dimer a significance (-log10\nP) is calculated by comparing the observed counts (n(D))\nfor the dimer to the expected counts (y(D)), assuming a\nPoisson distribution:\nwhere\nand n(W1) and n(W2) are the total number of occurrences\nof W1 and W2 in the UPSQs data set and\n is the number of independ-\nent positions in the data where a motif M of length L(M)\ncan be placed (M can be W1, W2 or D).

Similarity between pairs of dimers is\ncalculated by a simple scoring method, evaluating the\nnumber of matches minus the number of mismatches.\nMatches to N (an unknown base) or to any other base or\noverhangs are ignored (a heuristic method of sliding the\nsequences along to get the best score is applied). This\nscore is then normalised to between 0 and 1.\n3) The similarity matrix is used to cluster the significant\ndimers using CAST (Clustering Affinity Search Technique\n[34]) where a similarity threshold for clustering is set.\n4) For every cluster, the actual sequences in the UPSQs set\nmatched by any member of the cluster are extracted along\nwith up to 10 flanking nucleotides (dependent on the\nposition of the match and length of the UPSQ sequence).\nA multiple alignment of these sequences using CONSEN-\nSUS [35] produces an alignment matrix for that cluster.\n5) Each alignment matrix is converted to a PSWM using\nthe background base counts for the organism of interest.\nHere the background frequencies of A = 0.2953, C =\n0.2059, G = 0.2023, T = 0.2965 were used for E. coli and A\n= 0.1589, C = 0.3494, G = 0.3420, T = 0.1497 for S. coeli-\ncolor.\nA full description of the algorithm is given in the original\npublication [22].\nIn this work the thresholds used in steps 2 (dimer signifi-\ncance) and 3 (clustering threshold) are of the most inter-\nest. It is these thresholds that can affect the integrity of the\nPSWMs, which in turn could affect operon prediction\naccuracy. The different thresholds of dimer significance\nused were: -log10 P > 6, approximating to -log10(1\/amount\nof all dimers tested for), -log10 P > 3, approximating to -\nlog10(1\/amount of all perfectly palindromic (i.e. palin-\ndromic without any mismatches) dimers tested for), and\ntwo intermediate thresholds of -log10 P > 4 and -log10 P >\n5. Different clustering thresholds of 0.6, 0.7 and 0.8 were\nalso tested.\nPrediction of TFBSs\nWith each PSWM there is an associated distribution of\nscores obtained when applied to a given data set of\nsequences. Two distributions of scores are obtained when\nscoring sequences from either the UPSQs set that were\nused to build the PSWM (collected in step 4 of the algo-\nrithm), or sequences from the UPSQs set that were not\nused to build the PSWM (sequences that will have a 'score'\nbut should not have a significant match to the PSWM (as\nthey were not used to build the PSWM) and thus provide\na means of estimating noise in the PSWM prediction).\nThese two Gaussian distributions, describe the 'real hits'\nand the background random matches respectively.\nFrom the mean and standard deviation of the two distri-\nbutions, the difference between the two distributions can\nbe calculated. The larger the difference, the more specific\nthe PSWM is deemed to be, which is formally represented\nas a Z-score:\nUsing the mean and standard deviation of the two distri-\nbutions the specificity and sensitivity of searching for a\npotential TFBS can be controlled via two thresholds:\nthreshold1 = \u03bcbackground + x\u03c3background\nthreshold2 = \u03bcreal - x\u03c3real\nwhere x represents any real number and affects the false-\npositive and false-negative rates when using threshold1\nand threshold2 respectively.\nIn this study for a sequence to be predicted to contain a\ngiven TFBS the score of the sequence against the PSWM\nmust be greater than \u03bcreal-2\u03c3real (giving 98% coverage) and\u03bcbackground+S\u03c3background, where S is used to represent trials\nof different thresholds from 0 to 10 in 0.5 increments as\ndiscussed further in this work. Since this term is the only\npart of the threshold that changes, the TFBS prediction\nthreshold used will only be referred to herein as \u03bcback-\nground+S\u03c3background.\nUPSQs data sets used\nThe sequence data used to form the UPSQs and operon\nprediction test sets were taken from E. coli K12 strain\nMG1655 from Genbank (accession number:\nNC_000913[36,37]) and S. coelicolor chromosome (not\nplasmids) in EMBL (accession number: AL645882 version\n2 [38,39]). In E. coli the UPSQs set was created using the\nupstream intergenic sequences (maximum length 300 bp)\nof the first genes of known and predicted operons in the\nE. coli sequence taken from RegulonDB [40,41] as\ndescribed previously [22]. For S. coelicolor upstream inter-\ngenic sequences (maximum length 300 bp) of all genes in\nthe chromosome were used. Testing of the constructed\nPSWMs was conducted using the upstream intergenic\nsequences (maximum length 300 bp) of the positive and\nnegative examples of operon members of the relevant\norganism.\nZ\nreal background\nbackground\n=\n\u2212\u03bc \u03bc\n\u03c3Page 4 of 15\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Genomics 2008, 9:79 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/9\/79Positive and negative examples of operon members\nOperon definitions used throughout this work were based\non the annotated genome of E. coli K12 strain MG1655\nfrom Genbank [36,37] and the S. coelicolor chromosome\n(not plasmids) in EMBL [38,39], data sources described\nabove. Positive examples of operons were collected\nthrough searching the literature for experimentally vali-\ndated operons in S. coelicolor (e.g. [27]) and from the tran-\nscriptional unit experimentally based annotation in\nEcocyc for E. coli [42,43]. Negative examples of operons\nwere collected from knowledge of basic operon structure\napplicable to both organisms, illustrated in Figure 2.\nAssuming that the entire polycistronic transcript is docu-\nmented, non-operons of length 2 were formed by using\nthe initial gene of the operon and its upstream neighbour-\ning gene if that neighbour is transcribed in the same direc-\ntion (e.g. gene pair d-e), and the last gene in the\ndocumented operon and its downstream neighbouring\ngene, again if it is transcribed in the same direction (e.g.\ngene pair g-h). These negative examples are termed as\ntranscriptional boundaries. To increase the size of the\nnon-operonic data set a non-operon of length 3 was also\nformed by collecting triplets of genes that are transcribed\nin the opposite direction (e.g. genes b-c-d), termed as\ndirectional examples, as the central gene (e.g. gene 'c' in\nFigure 2) is certainly not in the same transcriptional unit\nas the two flanking genes transcribed in the opposite\ndirection (e.g. genes b and d in Figure 2). In total 35 oper-\nons and 1282 non-operons were collected for S. coelicolor,\nand 325 operons and 821 non-operons were collected for\nE. coli. Both positive and negative examples for S. coelicolor\nand E. coli are provided [see Additional file 1].\nAll examples of operonic genes (positive and negative)\nwere split into singular genes such that the operonic con-\nnection status (in the same operon or not) of all genes\nwith their respective upstream gene neighbours could be\ntested.\nResults\nCharacterisation of inverted repeat binding sites\nTypically for prokaryotes the binding sites of repressors,\ndual regulators and in some cases activators are character-\nised as inverted repeats (where word 2 is palindromic to\nword 1), which is driven by the predominantly homo-\ndimeric binding of transcription factors [20]. However,\n'perfect' palindromicity of a binding site where the two\nwords are an exact match is not always the case e.g. the lac\noperator [44]. Given the tendency for binding sites to be\nimperfect palindromes it is therefore appropriate to ana-\nlyse how many sites would be missed if only perfectly pal-\nindromic inverted repeat PSWMs were used when\npredicting TFBSs as a proxy for operons. Through the use\nof footprinting methods, where flanking nucleotides not\nbound by a transcription factor are degraded, a 'footprint'\nof the transcription factor can be obtained [45]. Although\nit is difficult to determine the precise binding site, the\nfootprint sequences can be used as an estimate of the\npotential palindromicity of the experimentally character-\nised binding regions. Currently, there is little footprint\ndata for S. coelicolor transcription factors and consequently\ntranscription factor footprint data for E. coli was down-\nloaded from the RegulonDB internet site [40,41], which\ncontained examples of 211 repressor sites, 77 activator\nsites and 341 dual regulator sites [see Additional file 2].\nAll footprints for each set of regulators (Activators, Dual\nor Repressors) were then searched for the longest inverted\nrepeat containing palindromes word 1 and word 2 and the\n'palindromicity' calculated. Here, palindromicity was\ndetermined by the use of two thresholds; length and mis-\nmatches allowed. Figure 3 shows the percentage of known\nsites (be it repressor, activator or dual regulator) that can\nbe characterised as an inverted repeat with each word of\nExamples of positive and control sets of operons\/non-operonsFigure 2\nExamples of positive and control sets of operons\/non-operons.Page 5 of 15\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Genomics 2008, 9:79 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/9\/79length 3, 4, or greater than 5 nucleotides, and having\neither 0, 1, or 2 internal palindromic mismatches between\nword 1 and word 2 (i.e. one cannot create an inverted\nrepeat with words of length 4 by adding a mismatch onto\nperfectly palindromic words of length 3).\nFrom Figure 3, and additionally Table 1, it is apparent that\nboth repressors and dual regulators are predominantly\ncharacterised by perfectly palindromic dyads (84% and\n79% respectively), agreeing with previous findings [46].\nActivators on the other hand, described in the literature as\ncapable of binding to direct\/inverted repeats, are not\n(44%). Furthermore, the largest proportion of perfectly\npalindromic inverted repeats is formed from words of 3\nnucleotides in length, particularly dual regulators (42%,\ndata not shown). As expected, allowing for 1 internal mis-\nmatch increases the overall proportion of palindromic\ndyad sites matched compared to no mismatches allowed,\nbut only a negligible increase is observed when consider-\ning 2 mismatches. Indeed, this typically just increased the\nlength of the potential sites compared to the 1 mismatch\nset (data not shown).\nWhen considering all transcription factor footprints\ntogether, as depicted in Figure 3 and Table 1, the overall\ncoverage obtained using palindromes and mismatches to\ncharacterise binding sites can be calculated. Coverage is\ndefined as the percentage of all footprint sites identified as\ncontaining a palindrome. Here, 77% coverage can be\nachieved by searching for perfect palindromes and\n92\u201393% coverage when allowing for 1 mismatch. How-\never, it is important to note that tolerating mismatches\ndecreases the specificity of binding site prediction. Of\ncourse, the occurrence of a palindromic inverted repeat\nwithin an upstream intergenic region does not necessarily\nmean that a sequence is a true binding site either, but it is\nexpected to increase the likelihood. Indeed, in support of\nthis, when comparing the coverage obtained (using Z-\nscore) searching for perfect palindromes in true footprint\nsites to that obtained from 500 random footprint simula-\ntions a significant difference (p < 0.05) is observed (see\nTable 1). Here, random bases were chosen to create a\nsequence the same length of true, known footprint exam-\nples taken from those used to create Figure 3. No signifi-\ncant difference was observed when allowing 1 or 2\nmismatches for Repressors and Dual regulators.\nRegulator type breakdown in TFBS footprintsFig re 3\nRegulator type breakdown in TFBS footprints.

However,\nour implementation did discover all the dimers predicted\nby the earlier study [22], and this set was also used in our\nevaluation protocol.\nDifferent thresholds of dimer significance (as described in\nthe methods section) were then applied and sets of signif-\nicant dimers were clustered using CAST [34] (step 3 of the\nalgorithm) producing 12 data sets in total. In addition to\nthese 12 sets of clustered sequences, the 849 clusters pub-\nlished previously [22], referred to as \"LiFlank\", were put\nthrough steps 4 and 5 of the PSWM construction algo-\nrithm. The resultant PSWMs for all data sets and the orig-\ninal PSWM data [22], referred to as \"Li\", were then used to\npredict binding sites in the upstream intergenic sequences\nof the positive and negative examples of operon members\nin E. coli with 0.5 increments of the TFBS prediction\nthreshold \u03bcbackground+S\u03c3background (see methods). For each\nincrement of S, counts of TFBS predictions for the positive\nand negative tests sets were made enabling the calculation\nof true positives (TP), false positives (FP), true negatives\n(TN) and false negatives (FN).\nThroughout this work we introduce a simple nomencla-\nture to distinguish the PSWM sets, x_y_z, which refers to\nthe Poisson distribution dimer significance threshold x,\nthe word clustering threshold y, and the final number of\nclusters z.\nUsing predicted TFBSs as predictors of operons creates\nslightly unusual statistics, since an absence of an upstream\npredicted TFBS is predictive for a member gene of an\noperon. Hence when a high threshold is used, no TFBSs\nare predicted by the PSWMs leading to over-prediction of\noperonic status \u2013 i.e. all genes in both operon member test\nsets are classed as operonic. This leads to a sensitivity (cov-\nerage) of 1 and a specificity of 0, and the positive predic-\ntive value converges to the ratio of operonic\/all genes. This\nis illustrated in the receiver operator characteristic (ROC)\nplots in Figures 4a and 4b. Similarly, at very low thresh-\nolds, TFBSs are over-predicted and most genes are classed\nas non-operonic. In this case, the sensitivity approaches 0\nand the specificity approaches 1; the positive predictive\nvalue is undefined here. Figure 4a shows that at a low\nTFBS prediction threshold (where more TFBS are pre-\ndicted) it is more likely that sequences without a predicted\nTFBS are operonic (although only reaching a positive pre-\ndictive value peak of ~0%). As the TFBS prediction thresh-\nold increases, fewer TFBSs are predicted leading to less\ncertainty about a gene's true operonic status. Indeed, only\n~28% of genes predicted to be operonic are actually oper-\nonic at the highest TFBS prediction threshold. The predic-\ntions and ROC plots can be compared using a single\nmetric, the area under the curve (A.U.C), which is a meas-\nure used to quantify the overall performance accuracy of\nTable 1: Coverage of inverted repeats in E. coli footprint data\nMismatches allowed Random average coverage % Footprint coverage % Z-score Associated p-value\nActivators\n0 55 44 -2.4 0.008\n1 82 74 -1.92 0.03\n2 82 75 -2.54 0.006\nDual\n0 68 79 4.84 6.61E-07\n1 96 96 1.54 0.06\n2 96 97 0.09 0.46\nRepressors\n0 66 84 6.43 0\n1 90 91 0.36 0.36\n2 91 91 -0.01 0.49\nAll regulators\n0 65 77 6.51 0\n1 93 92 0.30 0.38\n2 93 93 -1.09 0.14\nCoverage of known sites and random sites (after 500 shuffle simulations) considering different mismatch tolerances is shown with associated Z-\nscore and p-values for each regulator type.

The complete list of AUC values for different\ndata sets is shown in Table 2. The best performing PSWM\nset at discriminating operonic\/non-operonic genes is the\nLiFlank data set with 80% accuracy. This increase in accu-\nracy compared to the original Li data set (76% accuracy)\nis likely due to the wider PSWMs which incorporate flank-\ning sequence. During step 5 of the PSWM building pipe-\nline CONSENSUS [34] requires a fixed pattern length to\nbe supplied. In this work the length is determined by the\nlength of the shortest sequence matched back to the clus-\nter during step 4. Comparisons between the length of the\nLiFlank PSWMs and the original Li PSWMs sets revealed\nthat the LiFlank PSWMs were predominantly wider. The\nwider PSWMs and the higher accuracy of the LiFLank data\nset therefore indicate that the length of the matrix is\nimportant for operon prediction. This is not surprising as\nthe wider a PSWM is, the more specific it generally\nbecomes.\nThe second best operon predictor set (3_08_1506 with\n79% accuracy) is of one of the novel PSWM sets con-\nstructed in this study (using all steps of the algorithm).\nThe dimer significance of -log10 P > 3 and clustering\nthreshold of 0.8 was therefore used to construct PSWMs\nfor S. coelicolor resulting in 22,359 significant dimers pro-\nducing 3,628 clusters\/PSWMs (referred to herein as\nS3_08_3628). Previous work applying the same approach\non S. coelicolor [31] reported 2,497 putative TFBSs. How-\never, using dyad word lengths of 3\u20135 nt (used here)\ninstead of just 4 nt results in additional matrices, as well\nas all of the matrices found previously [31].\nTFBSs for operon prediction\nFigures 5a and 5b show the ROC curves for E. coli PSWM\nset 3_08_1506 and S. coelicolor PSWM set S3_08_3628\nrespectively when applied to the relevant positive and\nnegative operon member example datasets. When com-\nparing AUC scores of the test sets using all of the PSWMs\nit can be seen that overall TFBSs perform better as predic-\ntors of operons in E. coli (79%) than S. coelicolor (74%).\nHowever, the AUC score of S. coelicolor increased to 77%\nwhen using only palindromic (no mismatches allowed)\nPSWMs (S3_08_3628_0, nomenclature of x_y_z_m refer-\nring to Poisson distribution dimer significance threshold\nx, the word clustering threshold y, final number of clusters\nz and the number of mismatches allowed m), calculated\nby using the consensus sequence conveyed by a PSWM\n[47] and applying the same palindromicity method as\npreviously described. Conversely, operon prediction accu-\nracy in E. coli did not improve when using only palindro-\nmic dimers of the original 3_08_1506 PSWM set.\nThe TFBS prediction threshold of \u03bcbackground+4\u03c3background\nwith a very low false positive rate of ~0.003% was found\nto produce the highest operon prediction accuracy\n((TP+TN)\/(TP+FP+TN+FN)) in E. coli 3_08_1506_all\n(83%) and S. coelicolor S3_08_3628_0 (93%). Using this\nthreshold it was possible to analyse how a single PSWM's\noperon prediction accuracy is related to its Z-score (see\nmethods), the amount of TFBS predictions it makes, its\nAT-richness (based on the consensus sequence), and its\nnon-coding region bias (ratio of non-coding hits\/coding\nhits when applied to the genome). The resultant plots are\nshown in Figure 6 for S. coelicolor and Figure 7 for E. coli.\nFrom Figures 6 and 7 it is apparent, particularly in S. coe-\nlicolor (Figure 6), that the higher a PSWM's Z-score (and\nthus higher specificity), the lower the PSWM operon pre-\ndiction accuracy. Somewhat counter intuitively, this sug-\ngests that the more successful PSWMs in terms of operon\nprediction accuracy predict many TFBSs (due to a low Z-\nscore indicating lack of specificity in the prediction of an\nactual TFBS) such that very few operonic predictions are\nmade. Further evidence for this can be seen in Figures 6\nand 7 which show accuracy is correlated to the amount of\nhits, whereby many hits equates to higher accuracy. This\ndemonstrates that high operon prediction accuracy is\nobtained by maximising sensitivity (coverage) of the TFBS\nprediction, albeit at the expense of TFBS prediction specif-\nicity, and without over-predicting TFBSs either.\nFigures 6 and 7 also consider nucleotide biases. In E. coli\nthe AT-richness of a PSWM does not appear to be related\nto accuracy due to the wide distribution of scores (Figure\n7). In S. coelicolor however the matrices that are more AT\nrich tend to have a higher operon prediction accuracy,\nseen as a right shift in Figure 6.

Data is\npresented here that uses a different upstream motif, tran-\nscription factor binding sites, to predict operons in both S.\ncoelicolor and E. coli.

This strongly suggests that predicted\nTFBSs are a highly suitable feature for inclusion in inte-\ngrated operon prediction strategies, not only in well char-\nacterised systems but also in other poorly-annotated but\nsequenced prokaryotes, where good quality TFBS predic-\ntions can be obtained ab initio with the protocol described\nhere. It should be noted here that our definition of non-\noperonic genes is expanded by considering triplets with\ngenes transcribed in opposite directions and that the over-\nall prediction accuracy falls to around 64% when only the\ntranscriptional boundary set are used. However, this drop\noff also occurs using intergenic distance as the sole predic-\ntor, reducing to 62% accuracy with the same data set (and\nsame threshold as that optimised for the negative set\nincluding directional examples). Thus, our claim is not\nthat predicted TFBS alone are superior operon predictors,\nrather that they should be used as independent features\nthat offer a complementary approach.\nPSWM statisitics for E. coliFigure 7\nPSWM statisitics for E. coli.

Thus far inter-\ngenic distance has proven to be the most accurate single\nfeature for operon prediction in E. coli and B. subtilis\n[9,10,12-14,49]. Intergenic distance is implicitly linked to\nour method since TFBS identification\/prediction is\nfocused on intergenic non-coding regions only. Compar-\ning the operon prediction accuracy in S. coelicolor of the\nTFBS and intergenic distance approach (using the same\nlog-likelihood method documented in [15]) both features\nachieve similar accuracy (93\u201395%) when applied to the\nsame positive and negative (both directional and tran-\nscriptional boundary) operon example data set. The\noperon predictions themselves however are not perfectly\ncorrelated between the two approaches, although there is\na strong correlation \u2013 around 0.7 depending on thresh-\nolds used for TFBS and intergenic distance predictions.\nHence, the two features are complementary, and their\ncombination is expected to produce further improvement\nin operon prediction. Finally, although both methods\nperform equally well, TFBSs as predictors of operons are\nadvantageous since additional regulatory information\nabout a particular putative operon may be inferred.\nThis protocol derives genome-specific PSWMs (Position\nSpecific Weight Matrices) representing significant dimers,\nwhich can subsequently be exploited for operon predic-\ntion. The majority (77% \u2013 93%) of experimentally vali-\ndated E. coli transcription factor binding footprints can be\ncharacterised as palindromic (either with or without mis-\nmatches allowed) and consequently the PSWM set was fil-\ntered prior to operon prediction. Restricting the PSWM\ndata set to 'perfect' palindromes (no mismatches allowed)\nincreased operon prediction accuracy in S. coelicolor but\nnot E. coli and therefore, and supports the conclusion that\ngenome-specific models for operon prediction should be\nemployed [19,50]. The improved performance in S. coeli-\ncolor compared to E. coli may be a result of the PSWM con-\nstruction strategy. The complete upstream intergenic\nregions were used in S. coelicolor whilst a restricted set\nbased on annotated TFBSs was used in E. coli to find over-\nrepresented dimers. This would be expected to lead to\nincreased coverage in S. coelicolor, and perhaps increased\nspecificity in E. coli. This is borne out by the results, where\nhigh TFBS prediction coverage leads to superior operon\nprediction performance.\nThe false negatives (FNs) in this operon prediction strat-\negy are intra-operonic genes (genes known to be tran-\nscribed together with its respective upstream gene) that\nhave a predicted binding site (given the set of predicted\nPSWMs and applied threshold) in their upstream non-\ncoding regions. The existence of these is not wholly sur-\nprising given our previous results [19] which demon-\nstrated that intra-operonic genes with increased\nexpression relative to the first gene of the same operon are\nmore likely to have a predicted TFBS in their upstream\nnon-coding regions. This intra-operonic promotion of\ngene expression has been noted by other groups\n[11,32,33]. Using a \u03bcbackground+4\u03c3background as a PSWM\nthreshold we found that 23% of the S. coelicolor and 43%\nof the E. coli false negatives (35 and 227 FNs respectively)\nhad higher expression than the first gene of the same\noperon. Therefore, when microarray expression data is\navailable, it is possible to combine this with high quality\nTFBS predictions to improve the overall accuracy of\noperon prediction and gain information on the dynamic\nnature of some operons (specific, isolated control within\noperons for specific responses). This would not be possi-\nble with the application of intergenic distance alone to\npredict operons, and offers a way forward to address the\ntrue complexity of operon regulation.\nConclusion\nThis work has demonstrated the suitability of predicted\nTFBSs as operon predictors independently. We are cur-\nrently working on a genome specific operon predictor for\nboth S. coelicolor and E. coli that is able to combine TFBSs\nand other features found to be useful in operon predic-\ntions (Laing et al, Manuscript in preparation). Integrated\napproaches to operon prediction in prokaryotes are\nclearly needed, since expression of genes within operons\nis affected by several factors, not least the presence of suit-\nable transcription factor binding sites, and array-based\ndata on its own is insufficient to understand this phenom-\nenon. Indeed, a recently developed operon prediction\nmethod for S. coelicolor [11] that combines intergenic dis-\ntance, expression data and terminators, whilst able to\nshow comparable operon prediction accuracy to that pre-\nsented here, is unable to predict 'dynamic' operons,\ndefined as the isolated expression of a gene(s) from their\n'common' (under 'normal' conditions) transcriptional\nunit to which they reside. The findings of this work sug-\ngests that TFBS are a useful feature for predicting operons\nof all prokaryotes in their own right but also have the\ncapacity to allow the modelling of dynamic operon struc-\ntures of an entire genome in a particular, specific condi-\ntion (e.g. response to a stress) when combined with\nexpression data [19].\nAuthors' contributions\nEL carried out all of the calculations, data processing and\nanalyses, KS helped build datasets, and SJH designed\nexperiments, drafted the manuscript and led the overall\nproject.
