Sequence data for type III collagen come from bovine skin\ncollagen and was kindly given to us by Dr. J. Chapman and Dr. M.\nHumphries. Although these sequence data do not come from the same\nspecies used in this work this is not a problem, as a substantial measure\nof homology between species exists.\nFive liver and six skin images from two different species are analyzed\nusing the proposed approach. For each imagewe derive a single average\nD-period, so that each set is described by a small number of average\nD-periods. The D-periods of each set are being aligned to each other\nand to model I as reference. We then average them and get an overall\naverage D-period for each set (total set). Next, we employ the proposed\npattern analysis procedure to derive type I tendencies for each average\nD-period, i.e., for each set.\nTable I summarizes our results. The \ufb01eld named \u201cnumber of periods\u201d\nrecords the number of periods that the D-period extraction algorithm\nsamples from the current image. The subsequent \u201ctype I proportion\u201d\n\ufb01eld records the proportion a of model I at the mixture model that was\nfound to correlate at the highest degree with the corresponding average\nD-period, and the \ufb01eld \u201ccorrelation coef\ufb01cient\u201d encodes the degree of\ncorrelation between this mixture model and the average image D-pe-\nriod. The row labeled \u201cTotal Set\u201d presents the results corresponding to\nthe overall D-period of the entire set. A \ufb01rst comparison indicates that\nthe relative amount of type I periods is larger in liver than in skin \ufb01b-\nrils. Indeed, the relative type I tendencies for liver and skin sets are re-\nspectively 94% and 91%. Our results are in good agreement with those\nderived from biochemical methods [3] con\ufb01rming that liver contains\nan assortment of collagen types, usually with type I predominating,\nthough this is not always the case. Skin has a different overall pro\ufb01le\nfrom other tissues. Two collagen types, I and III, are the main con-\nstituents accompanied by other minor types.\nThe signi\ufb01cance of the derived linear proportion coef\ufb01cients is tested\nvia statistical hypothesis tests. We validate the ability of a single av-\nerage period (for the total set) to represent the sample population, in re-\nspect to proportion of and correlation with the mixture model. In order\nto assess results concerning the agreement of a sample mean \u0016x with the\noverall D-period measure \u0016 derived (tested mean), we set up a statis-\ntical hypothesis test for type I proportion of the form\nH0:\u0016x = \u0016; versus H1:\u0016x 6= \u0016:\nFor sample size and standard deviation m and s, respectively, the test\nstatistic t1 = j(\u0016x \u0000 \u0016)=(s=pm)j is compared against the one-sided\nthreshold for the signi\ufb01cance level a, which is speci\ufb01ed as the upper\na=2 percentile of the t-distribution withm\u00001 degrees of freedom. The\ntest statistics with the corresponding thresholds at 10% signi\ufb01cance are\nalso in the Table I. Overall, it is derived that the total set measures are\nin good agreement with the sample means, i.e., the test statistic cannot\nreject the null hypotheses.\nV. CONCLUSION\nIn this workwe explore the potential for automatic analysis of micro-\nscopic images from periodic-\ufb01brillar structures. We introduce a pattern\nmatching approach for the analysis and comparison of average D-pe-\nriods with sequence generated histograms. This algorithm aims in de-\nriving the relative content of type I collagen, but it can be easily modi-\n\ufb01ed to deal with other types of \ufb01brillar proteins (theoretical models).\nWe plan to extend this approach to study interactions among various\ntypes of collagen testing normal and pathological tissue of several types\nand ages.\nREFERENCES\n[1] B.

A schematic showing the construction of a single bore of the device.\nAlternating conducting planes are excited by opposing phases from a signal\ngenerator. A typical device consists of 20 conducting layers, with hundreds of\nbores per separator.\nstamp and those of a credit card. The advantage of such devices is\nthat they allow the analysis of small samples rapidly, allow use of\nminiaturised sensing systems, and can be constructed so that the inte-\ngrated \ufb02uid\/sensing element (the \u201clab on a chip\u201d itself) is disposable\n(with bene\ufb01t for maintaining sterile conditions and avoiding contam-\nination). When electrodes on the micro-scale are used, a number of\ntechniques become available for use. AC electrokinetic phenomena\nsuch as dielectrophoresis (DEP) have been used for many years for\nthe manipulation, separation, and analysis of cellular-scale particles.\nDEP is the phenomenon of attraction to, or repulsion from, regions\nof high electric \ufb01eld strength [1], [2]. Particles experiencing such\nforces can be made to exhibit a variety of motions including attraction,\nrepulsion, and rotation by changing the nature of the dynamic \ufb01eld.\nThe orientation and magnitude of the force or torque is related to the\nrelative polarisabilities of the particle and suspending medium. Study\nof this behavior allows the determination of biophysical properties\nof the particles, with potential for clinical applications (e.g., [3]\u2013[5]);\nunlike \ufb02ow cytometry, DEP does not require \ufb02uorescent staining, as\nparticles are differentiated by the act of attraction to, or repulsion\nfrom, the force-generating electrodes.\nBy exploiting the fact that different particles may experience forces\nin different directions when all other factors are the same, researchers\nhave been able to use DEP to separate mixtures of cells on electrode\narrays, including viable and nonviable cells, cancers, blood, and\nmicro-organisms (as reviewed in [6]). However, these separation pro-\ncesses have been slow to migrate from laboratory to market because\nthe planar nature of the \ufb02ow cell needed in order to microfabricate\nelectrodes greatly limits the throughput rate of the sample in the\ndevice. Whilst early electrodes for the DEP manipulation of cells\nwere fabricated on the millimeter scale and employed high voltages\nto generate suf\ufb01cient DEP forces, DEP manipulation since the late\n1980s has employed pseudo-2-D electrode devices, wherein thin \ufb01lms\n(typically 100 nm) are etched away using photolithographic processes.\nThis allows the fabrication of the micrometer-scale electrode devices\nrequired for DEP manipulation of cells at much lower voltages, but\nhas the drawback that the working volume of cell solution that can be\nanalyzed is very small, restricting solution throughput to a maximum\nof perhaps hundreds of \u0016l\/h.\nIn this paper we describe, for the \ufb01rst time, a composite three-di-\nmensional (3-D) electrode array structure capable of increasing this\nthroughput by over one order of magnitude; the device is capable\nof fabrication with micrometer-scale electrodes without requirement\nfor access to photolithographic processing equipment or clean room\nfacilities. The device consists of a laminate structure using conducting\n\ufb01lm 30 \u0016m thick and insulating \ufb01lm 150 \u0016m thick, with holes drilled\nthrough the laminate. The alternate conducting layers are energised\nwith opposing phases, so that the electric \ufb01eld morphology along\nthe wall of the hole is very similar to 2-D interdigitated electrode\nstructures. However, the new device offers greater effective trapping\nvolume and the bene\ufb01ts of massive parallelization (allowing much\nhigher throughput than conventional devices) and ease of low-cost\nfabrication.\nII. CONSTRUCTION\nWhereas previous DEP studies have used electric \ufb01elds generated\nby planar [effectively two-dimensional (2-D)] electrodes etched from\ngold \ufb01lms deposited across the surface of a microscope slide, the\nmethod presented here uses a conductor\/composite laminate arrange-\nment to manufacture electrodes with similar dimensions, but which\ncan be structured along the surface of a hollow cylinder. A schematic\nof the device is shown in Fig. 1. The laminate consists of alternating\nlayers of insulating and conducting material, and the conducting layers\nproject out of the laminate on opposing sides of the device, so that the\nsignal inputs can be connected to these projecting ends. Channels are\nformed through the laminate by drilling, so that each hole is equivalent\nto a \u201crolled-up\u201d 2-D electrode array. This arrangement encloses a\nmuch larger volume than planar electrodes on a similar scale. A large\nnumber of holes can be drilled through the laminate to increase the\nthroughput of the device.\nConstruction details were as follows. Aluminum foil and epoxy resin\n\ufb01lm (ACGLTA45-1; Advanced Composites Group, U.K.) were used to\nform the conducting and insulating layers, respectively, which were cut\nto size using templates of 100\u0002 100 mm and 30\u0002 100 mm, respec-\ntively. A sharp knife was adequate to cut the layers. The layers were\ncarefully stacked by placing the epoxy layers between the aluminum\nlayers, with alternating aluminum layers protruding from the sides. The\ncompleted structure, consisting of 20 aluminum layers and 19 epoxy\nlayers. was placed between release \ufb01lm (inner) and glass plates (outer).\nA weight of 0.94 kg was placed on the upper glass plate to decrease the\noverall thickness of the structure from 6 mm to 2 mm (\u00060:5 mm). The\nlaminate was then placed in an oven and cured at 55 \u000eC (calibrated by\nthermocouple) overnight for 16 h. A jig consisting of metal rods that\nspanned the length of the lower glass plate was constructed on the lower\nglass plate to ensure that the structure remained stable whilst curing.\nAfter 16 h of curing, the structure was cut into three strips with a \ufb01ne\ntooth saw.\nFollowing construction, a multimeter was used to determine if any\nelectrode layers were touching by measuring the resistance between\nadjacent layers. Where adjacent layers were found to be conducting,\nwhich may have developed when cutting the cured structure into strips,\nthe strips were polished downwith graded sanding paper until the struc-\ntures were found to be fully insulated. Holes were drilled using a com-\nputer-numerically controlled machine. Two types of separator geom-\netry were drilled; the \ufb01rst with 72 \u0002 1000 \u0016m-diameter holes, and the\nsecond with 288\u0002 500 \u0016m -diameter holes, written across a circular\narea with a radius of approximately 10 mm. The insulation test was re-\npeated after drilling to ensure there was still no conduction path. Fig. 2\nshows a cross section of a cured structure examined using an optical\nmicroscope (Zeiss Photomicroscope II, Germany). It can be seen that\nthe thickness of the epoxy layer (black) was not constant, but varied\nbetween 130\u2013150 \u0016m. The aluminum foil thickness measured before\ncuring was found to be 30 \u0016m.\nIII. SIMULATION\nIt is possible to make a crude approximation of the maximum useful\n\ufb02ow velocity through the bore by considering that the \ufb02ow through the\nbore is equal across the cross section of the bore (though in reality,\nthe \ufb02ow pro\ufb01le is parabolic). We can determine the optimal \ufb02ow rate\nthrough the separator by considering the maximum distance a particle\ncan travel so as to reach the edge of the bore before the \ufb02ow pushes it\nclear of the device, and thereby determine the effective volume from\nwhich the separator can pull particles. The DEP forces were evalu-\nated from \ufb01nite element simulations by summing the forces along the\npath from bore axis to bore edge using the Maxwell 3-D (Ansoft Inc,\nPittsburgh, PA) \ufb01eld simulation suite.

A micrograph showing a cross section of a completed device, with\nmetal electrodes (bright) sandwiched between insulating material (dark). The\nscale bar indicates 100 \u0016m between divisions.\nFig. 3. An electric \ufb01eld simulation showing the \ufb01eld strength distribution in\na simple 4-conductor bore, with \ufb01eld strengths shown from 0 Vm (black) to\n3\u000210 Vm (white). Note that although the system is axisymmetric, there is\na \ufb01eld gradient visible across the entrance of the hole that may attract particles\ntoward the outer bore edge; there is also a toroidal \ufb01eld null approximately\nhalfway between the axis and the edge.\nthrough a simpli\ufb01ed bore containing four electrodes is shown in Fig. 3.\nThe optimal bulk \ufb02ow rate through the chambers, allowing enough time\nfor particles to collect, can be found using the longest time it takes a\nparticle to reach the wall for the 1000-\u0016m and 500-\u0016m bores. Since\nthe radial force in an axisymmmetric system is zero, it is possible to\nde\ufb01ne a \u201cuseable volume,\u201d based on the time taken for a particle to\ntravel from the edge of that volume to be trapped at the electrodes for\ngiven conditions of applied potential and the dielectric properties of\nthe system. From the \ufb01nite element simulations, a lower threshold for\nthe electric \ufb01eld equating to a force of 10 pN was found, and under\nthese conditions, the average time it takes for a particle to travel the\ndistance from the inner edge of the useable volume to the bore wall\nwas found to be 10.45 s for the 500-\u0016m bore chamber and 285 s for the\n1000-\u0016m bore chamber. The optimal volumetric \ufb02ow rate through each\nbore in order to achieve this was calculated to be 22 \u0016l\/h\u00001 and 87 \u0016l\nhr\u00001 for the 1000 \u0016m and 500 \u0016m bores, respectively. The total volu-\nmetric \ufb02ow required to pass through the cell separators is found simply\nby multiplying the volumetric \ufb02ow rate by the respective number of\nbores. The total volumetric \ufb02ow rate for bore diameters of 1000 \u0016m\n(71 holes) and 500 \u0016m (288 holes) are 1.82 \u0016l\/h \u00001 and 25 \u0016l\/h\u00001, re-\nspectively. Since only those cells within the volume between the bore\nwall and the limit of dielectrophoretic force will be separated in this\ntime, it is possible to determine how many cells of the total are likely\nto be collected by calculating the ratio of the total bore volume and\nthe volume in which trapping is effective. Results suggest that 75%\nof the 500-\u0016m-diameter chamber is effective, whilst only 25% of the\n1000-\u0016m-diameter chamber is effective. Assuming all cells within the\neffective volume are separated, then an initial 50:50 mix of two cell\npopulations would contain a ratio of about 87:13 after separation in de-\nvices with 500 \u0016m bores, and 63:37 separation in devices with 1000\n\u0016m bores after a single pass. This \ufb01gure is not immutable, but depends\non the \ufb02ow rate; where \ufb02ow is slower, the particles have more time to\nmove from the chamber and so more particles can be separated.\nIV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nIn order to test the device, yeast cells (S.cervisiae), strain CG-1945e,\nwere cultured in YPD media (Sigma Aldrich). An aliquot of live cells\nwere rendered nonviable by heat-treatment in a water bath at 90 \u000eC\nfor 30 min. Viable and nonviable cells were resuspended in 280 mM\nmannitol. Cells were counted using a hemacytometer, and mixed in\na 50:50 ratio (total cell concentration 1:95 \u0002 107 cells ml\u00001, \ufb01nal\nvolume 10 ml). Methylene blue was used to distinguish between live\nand dead yeast cells, as described by Lee et al. [7]. A 20-MHz func-\ntion generator (Thurlby-Thandar Ti1000, Huntingdon, UK) was used\nto supply a sinusoidal 10-MHz, 10-V ac signal to the separator. A sy-\nringe pump (Model A-99, Razel Scienti\ufb01c Instrument) was used to\npump cell solution through the separator using the \ufb02ow rates calcu-\nlated above. The tubing and the separator were washed with distilled\nwater at 100mLhr\u00001 before and after each experiment to clear cells and\nother debris from previous experiments. For the 500-\u0016m bore cham-\nbers, the average percentage of viable cells collected was 86%, with\n14% of cells in the eluted sample being nonviable. For separators with\na bore size of 1000-\u0016m diameter, a mean percentage of 73% of cells\ncollected were viable cells, and 27% were nonviable. The device with\nsmaller bore hole diameters did show a higher mean percentage of vi-\nable cells collected than for the larger bore diameters, despite being\ndriven at a signi\ufb01cantly higher \ufb02ow rate. The number of cells of both\npopulations agrees well with the predictions from the electric \ufb01eld sim-\nulations, particularly for the 500-\u0016m bores where there was a 1% dif-\nference between predicted and measured ratios of separated particles.\nAlthough the overall agreement between theory and experiment is rea-\nsonable, there are a number of possible sources of error. Not only have\napproximations been made in the simulations, but the longer the sep-\narator took to \ufb02ush the cells through the separator, the longer is the\nperiod of time during which viable cells can reproduce and change the\nrecorded result.\nV. CONCLUSION\nIn conclusion, this novel 3-D dielectrophoretic separation device has\nbeen shown to be capable of high-throughput separation of cells using\nmachined electrodes with dimensions similar to those used in pho-\ntolithographic systems. Using our present system a throughput of 25\n\u0016l\/h\u00001 has been shown to be possible, but the nature of the device lends\nitself to high degrees of parallelization. A similar device, with bores\ncovering a radius of 60 mm should theoretically be able to process 1\nL\/h\u00001. Such a system may greatly extend the implementation of di-\nelectrophoretic devices in a broad range of industrial applications.\nREFERENCES\n[1] H. A.
