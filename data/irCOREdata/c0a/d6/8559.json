In \norder to improve air-fuel mixing, it is important to understand the fuel atomisation and \nspray formation processes. Researchers have investigated the characteristics of the spray \nbehaviour, formation and structure for the high-pressure injector by experimental and \ntheoretical approaches in order to improve the combustion performance and reduce \nexhaust emissions. However, further detailed studies of the atomisation characteristics and \nspray development processes of high-pressure diesel sprays are still relevant. \nIntelligent systems, software systems incorporating artificial intelligence, have shown \nmany advantages in engineering system control and modelling. They have the ability to \nrapidly model and learn characteristics of multi-variant complex systems, exhibiting \nadvantages in performance over more conventional mathematical techniques. This has led \nto them being applied in diverse applications in power systems, manufacturing, \noptimisation, medicine, signal processing, control, robotics, and social\/psychological \n sciences [1, 2]. Fuzzy logic is a problem-solving technique that derives its power from its \nability to draw conclusions and generate responses based on vague, ambiguous, \nincomplete and imprecise information. To simulate this process of human reasoning it \napplies the mathematical theory of fuzzy sets first defined by Zadeh, in 1965 [3]. Fuzzy \ninference is the process of formulating a mapping from a given input value to an output \nvalue using fuzzy logic. The mapping then provides a basis from which decisions can be \nmade, or patterns discerned. It has been proved that the system can effectively express \nhighly non-linear functional relationships [4]. Fuzzy inference systems (FIS) have been \nsuccessfully applied in fields such as automatic control, data classification, decision \nanalysis, expert systems and computer vision. \nThe Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), developed in the early 90s by \nJang [5], combines the concepts of fuzzy logic and neural networks to form a hybrid \nintelligent system that enhances the ability to automatically learn and adapt. Hybrid \nsystems have been used by researchers for modelling and predictions in various \nengineering systems. The basic idea behind these neuro-adaptive learning techniques is to \nprovide a method for the fuzzy modelling procedure to learn information about a data set, \nin order to automatically compute the membership function parameters that best allow the \nassociated FIS to track the given input\/output data. The membership function parameters \nare tuned using a combination of least squares estimation and backpropagation algorithm \nfor membership function parameter estimation. These parameters associated with the \nmembership functions will change through the learning process similar to that of a neural \nnetwork. Their adjustment is facilitated by a gradient vector, which provides a measure of \nhow well the FIS is modelling the input\/output data for a given set of parameters. Once \nthe gradient vector is obtained, any of several optimisation routines could be applied in \norder to adjust the parameters so as to reduce error between the actual and desired outputs. \nThis allows the fuzzy system to learn from the data it is modelling. The approach has the \nadvantage over the pure fuzzy paradigm that the need for the human operator to tune the \nsystem by adjusting the bounds of the membership functions is removed. \nMany of the combustion problems are exactly the types of problems and issues for \nwhich an AI approach appears to be most applicable and has the potential for making \nbetter, quicker and more accurate predictions than traditional methods. The increasing \navailability of advanced computer equipment and sensory systems, frequently results in \nthe production of large amounts of information-rich data, and there are often inadequate \nmeans of analysing it so as to extract meaning. The aim of this investigation was to apply \nintelligent systems tools and techniques to achieve an improved ability to analyse large \ncomplex data sets generated during engine research in a semi-automated way. An \nintelligent paradigm was created based on a fuzzy logic inference system combined with \nconventional techniques. \n \n \n 2 Methods \n2.1 Pure Fuzzy Logic Model \nFuzzy logic provides a practicable way to understand and manually influence the \nmapping behaviour. In general, fuzzy logic uses simple rules to describe the system of \ninterest rather than analytical equations, making it easy to implement. An advantage, such \nas robustness and speed, fuzzy logic method is one of the best solutions for system \nmodelling and control. A FIS contains three main components, the fuzzification stage, the \nrule base and the defuzzification stage. The fuzzification stage is used to transform the so-\ncalled crisp values of the input variables into fuzzy membership values. Then, these \nmembership values are processed within the rule-base using conditional \u2018if-then\u2019 \nstatements. The outputs of the rules are summed and defuzzified into a crisp analogue \noutput value.  The effects of variations in the parameters of a FIS can be readily \nunderstood and this facilitates calibration of the model. \nThe system inputs, which in this case are the cylinder pressure and the air density, are \ncalled linguistic variables, whereas \u2018high and \u2018very high\u2019 are linguistic values which are \ncharacterised by the membership function. Following the evaluation of the rules, the \ndefuzzification transforms the fuzzy membership values into a crisp output value, for \nexample, the penetration depth. The complexity of a fuzzy logic system with a fixed \ninput-output structure is determined by the number of membership functions used for the \nfuzzification and defuzzification and by the number of inference levels. A fuzzy system of \nthis kind requires that knowledgeable human operate initialise the system parameters e.g. \nthe membership function bounds. The operator must then optimise these parameters to \nachieve a required level of accuracy of mapping of the physical system by the fuzzy \nsystem. While the visual nature of a fuzzy system facilitates the optimisation of the \nparameters, the need for it to be accomplished manually is a disadvantage. \n2.2 ANFIS Model \nANFIS largely removes the requirement for manual optimisation of the fuzzy system \nparameters. A neural network is used to automatically tune the system parameters, for \nexample the membership function bounds, leading to improved performance without \noperator invention. In addition to a purely fuzzy approach, an ANFIS was also developed \nfor the estimation of spray penetration because the combination of neural network and \nfuzzy logic enables the system to learn and improve its performance based on past data. \nThe neuro-fuzzy system with the learning capability of neural network and with the \nadvantages of the rule-base fuzzy system can improve the performance significantly and \ncan provide a mechanism to incorporate past observations into the classification process. \nIn a neural network the training essentially builds the system. However using a neuro-\n fuzzy scheme, the system is built by fuzzy logic definitions and then it is refined using \nneural network training algorithms. \n3 Experimental Work \nA large collection of spray data are generated using the Ricardo Proteus test engine. \nThese data comprised images depicting the spray patterns of diesel injection processes, \nunder selected conditions of relative pressure, nozzle size and type and in-cylinder air \ntemperature. The images representing time-varying spray under each relative pressure \ncondition were examined and processed using a thresholding technique whereby each \nimage representing the instant of maximum penetration length was then determined, \nyielding a maximum penetration value which could be linked with its corresponding \nrelative pressure across the injector. The collected maximum spray penetration values and \ncorresponding relative pressures then formed a labelled data to be modelled by the FIS as \nshown schematically in Figure 1. \n \nFig. 1.

There were two stages in the inference model, the in-cylinder pressure and the air \ndensity; both stages are described in detail. The pressure and density range from 60MPa - \n160MPa and 14kg\/m3 - 42kg\/m3 respectively. Both in-cylinder pressure and air density \nfuzzy sets used generalised bell-shaped membership functions for classes low, medium \nand high. It was empirically selected based on the features of all data under consideration \nalthough in many cases membership functions are fixed and somewhat arbitrarily chosen. \nThe process was carried out by examining the ranges of all data sets to determine where \nthe majority of points were located. The functions were also created to have an \napproximately equal amount of overlap between each membership curve. Experimental \nadjustment of the limits of the membership classes enabled the response of the model to \nbe tailored to the experimental output from the experimental data. \nThe rule structure is essentially predetermined by the user\u2019s interpretation of the \ncharacteristics of the input parameters in the model. The contents of these rule-base and \nmembership functions undertake many modifications as part of the process of heuristic \noptimisation and in many cases it is a continuing process. Examples of the rules initially \ncontained in the rule-base for the pure fuzzy model are shown in Table 2. \n \n \n \n Table 2.

Fuzzy sets \n \n \nFig. 3. Pure fuzzy logic model \u2013 surface \nplot \n \nThe fuzzifed values for the outputs of the rules were classified into membership sets \nsimilarly to the input values. While the output membership functions may be trapezoidal \nor triangular, in this case, an output singletons were used which has a compact form and \ncomputationally efficient representation. The fuzzy output singletons were defuzzified to \na crisp value of penetration depth by means of the widely-used centre of gravity method. \nThe control surface in Figure 3 shows the crisp value of penetration depth at different \ncombinations of in-cylinder pressure and air density using a pure fuzzy logic model. Each \nof these intersection points indicates the differing predicted value of spray penetration \ndepth, which is determined by the design of fuzzy sets, rule-base and membership \nfunctions. The surface plot acts as a practical means of determining the output needed for \neach combination of input parameters. \n 3.3 Neuro-fuzzy Model \nA FIS was devised using Matlab\u00ae based application, ANFIS.  A neuro-adaptive \nlearning technique facilitated the learning of information about a data set by the fuzzy \nmodelling procedure, in order to compute the membership function parameters that best \nallow the associated FIS to track the given input\/output data rather than choosing the \nparameters associated with a given membership function arbitrarily.  \nA Matlab programme was generated and compiled; The pre-processed input\/output \nspray vector matrix which contained all the necessary representative features was used to \ntrain the FIS. Figure 4 shows the structure of the ANFIS; a Sugeno FIS was used in this \ninvestigation. Figure 5 shows the fuzzy rule architecture of the FIS which consisted of 9 \nfuzzy rules. During training in ANFIS, 6 sets of pre-processed data were used to conduct \n180 cycles of learning. Figure 6 shows the final membership functions under two different \nair input conditions derived by training the generalised bell-shaped membership function.  \n \n  \nFig. 4.

Surface plot showing \nrelationship between input and output \nparameters \n 4 Results and Discussion \nTable 3 shows the predicted penetration length obtained from the ANFIS. Figure 7 \ndepicts a three-dimensional plot that represents the mapping from relative pressure and air \ndensity to spray penetration length. As the relative pressure and air density increases, the \npredicted penetration length increases in a non-linear piecewise manner, this being largely \ndue to non-linearity of the characteristic of the input vector matrix derived from the raw \nimage data. This assumes that these raw image data are fully representative of the features \nof the data that the trained FIS is intended to model. However the data are inherently \nnoisy and training data may not always faithfully represent all the features of the data that \nshould be presented to the model. Therefore, the accuracy of the model will be adversely \naffected under such circumstances. \n4.1 Model Validation \nThe data in Table 3 was used to determine how well the FIS model could predict the \npenetration length corresponding to various values of pressure and density. Figure 8 \nshows scatter plot of the measured and FIS modelled penetration length utilising six sets \nof testing data. These two diagrams demonstrate that the predicted values are close to the \nexperimentally-measured values, as many of the data points fall very close to the diagonal \n(dotted) line, indicating good correlation. Figure 9 shows similar comparisons between the \nFIS-modelled and measured values of the penetration length using the same testing data. \nClearly the model created by ANFIS has a better agreement than the pure fuzzy logic \nmodel. The correlation coefficient also suggested identical findings. \n \nTable 3.

Comparisons between predicted \nand measured penetration \n4.2 Discussion \nThe ANFIS is a non-linear computational method that has potential for modelling \ncomplex systems with unclear input to output relationships due to its ability to combine \nfuzzy logic and system identification techniques in a hybrid manner. This type of system \nhas several advantages when assigned to applications in which only partial knowledge of \nthe system characteristics are known, as is typically the case with engineering systems. \nAdditionally, the ANFIS can rapidly identify important characteristics of the data, which \nis an important and useful feature of models used for estimation purposes in IC engines \nresearch. In the experiment, we have used an ANFIS to predict changes in diesel spray \npenetration depth as a potential means to monitor impending changes in combustion \nchamber and fuel injector design. As an initial step toward modelling and prediction with \nan ANFIS for this particular application, it has proven very useful for short-term \nprediction of penetration depth using engine operating parameters as the input. \nThe correlation coefficient reflects a model\u2019s ability to predict the output based on the \ninput used. While both models performed fairly well and approximated the output \nfunction to a reasonable extent, the ANFIS model exhibited improved performance in this \nrespect. Pure fuzzy logic models were conveniently constructed whilst the ANFIS \nperformed well in cases where the input to output relationships become more complex. \n5 Conclusions \nThis paper demonstrated that fuzzy and neuro-fuzzy techniques can be used to model \ndiesel fuel spray penetration for an internal combustion engine, leading to convenient and \nquick investigation on the effect of penetration length under different operating \nparameters, including in-cylinder pressure, density, air temperature, etc. The pure fuzzy \n logic and neuro-fuzzy system, ANFIS employed in this work are quick and robust. It has \nbeen applied to sets of pre-processed raw diesel engine spray data and successfully \ncompared. The pure fuzzy logic model employed simple calibrated membership functions \nand nine optimised rules to represent a diesel spray input\/output mapping whilst the \nneuro-fuzzy model has based on a total of six sets of experimental image data which were \nused for training the FIS. Both devised models were validated by comparing the predicted \nresults against the experimental data. The correlation coefficient of the penetration length \nestimated by ANFIS is 0.997. The pure fuzzy logic model has a smaller figure of 0.971 \nwhich suggested a poorer correlation with this model. \nThese fuzzy models set an example of how intelligent technique can be used in diesel \nspray modelling. The system is very conductive to improvement and adjustment and it can \nbe fine-tuned and improved over time when more engine operating parameters become \navailable. Moreover, these techniques and idea can conveniently be extended to, and be \ninvaluable for, other combustion systems such as modelling and emission predictions in: \nboilers, furnaces and incinerators. Also, for internal combustion engines, potential \napplications include modelling and control of: spark ignition engines and gas engines. \n \nReferences \n \n1. Kalogirou S.A.
