INTRODUCTION AND MAIN RESULTS\nThis paper is concerned with the distribution of the eigenvalues of random matrices under\nthe generalized orthogonal ensemble, as studied by Dyson, Boutet de Monvel, Pastur and\nShcherbina(6), and in the text of Mehta(18), page 56. Let X be a real symmetric n \u00d7 n\nmatrix, and let dX be the product of the usual Lebesgue measure on the entries that are\non or above the leading diagonal. There is a natural action of the orthogonal group by\nconjugation on such matrices\n1 Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Lancaster University, Lancaster LA1 4YF, England,\nUnited Kingdom; email g.blower@lancaster.ac.uk\n1\nO(n) \u00d7Msn(R) \u2192Msn(R) : (U,X) 7\u2192 UXU\u2020,\nand the orbit of each X contains a unique diagonal matrix with leading diagonal entries\nin increasing order, which we identify with an element of\n\u2206n = {\u03bb = \u03bb(n) = (\u03bbj )nj=1 \u2208 Rn : \u03bb1 \u2264 \u03bb2 \u2264 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2264 \u03bbn}.\nThroughout this paper, the potential function for the ensemble is a real function v\nthat is twice continuously differentiable and that satisfies v(x) \u2265 (2 + \u03b4) log |x| for some\n\u03b4 > 0 and all sufficiently large |x|. Then one can form the normalized trace \u03c4 = 1n\n\u2211n\nj=1 \u03bbj\nand V (X) = tracenv(X) =\n1\nn\n\u2211n\nj=1 v(\u03bbj ) by functional calculus, and there exists Zn with\n0 < Zn <\u221e such that\n\u03bdn(dX) = Z\n\u22121\nn exp{\u2212n2V (X)}dX (1.1)\ndefines a probability measure on Msn(R). This \u03bdn(dX) is invariant under the orthogonal\nconjugation action on Msn(R); hence it is termed the generalized orthogonal ensemble.\nHere we consider the empirical distribution of eigenvalues of X, namely\n\u00b5(\u03bb)n =\n1\nn\nn\u2211\nj=1\n\u03b4\u03bbj , (1.2)\nwhere \u03b4\u03bbj denotes the unit point mass at the eigenvalue \u03bbj ; typically the eigenvalues of X\nwill be random, but are unlikely to be large. Let\n\u2126An = {X \u2208Msn(R) : \u2212A\/2 < \u03bb1 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < \u03bbn < A\/2},\nwhich is invariant under orthogonal conjugation. Then Lemma 1 of ref. 6 asserts that\nthere exist c > 0 and A < \u221e such that \u03bdn(\u2126An ) \u2265 1 \u2212 e\u2212cn. Hence there is no loss in\nrestricting the ensemble to \u2126An and working with \u03bd\u02dcn(dX) = \u03bdn(\u2126\nA\nn )\n\u22121\u03bdn(dX), so that\n\u00b5\n(\u03bb)\nn is supported on [\u2212A\/2, A\/2]. We impose the measure \u2297\u221en=1\u03bd\u02dcn on\n\u220f\u221e\nn=1M\ns\nn(R). Let\nqn(\u03c4 ) d\u03c4 be the distribution of the normalized trace \u03c4 of X, where X is random subject to\n\u03bdn. The main result of this paper is the following.\n2\nTheorem 1.1. (i) Suppose that v is twice differentiable with v\u2032\u2032(x) \u2265 \u03ba0 for all\nx \u2208 [\u2212A\/2, A\/2], where \u03ba0 > 0. Then under the laws \u03bd\u02dcn, the empirical distributions\nof eigenvalues converge weakly almost surely to some non-random probability measure \u03c1\nwhich is supported in [\u2212A\/2, A\/2]; so that\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nf(x)\u00b5(\u03bb)n (dx) \u2192\n\u222b A\/2\n\u2212A\/2\nf(x) \u03c1(dx) (n\u2192\u221e) (1.3)\nfor almost all \u03bb for each bounded and continuous real function f.\n(ii) Suppose that v\u2032\u2032(x) \u2265 \u2212\u03ba, where \u03ba < 1\/(3A2), and that the variance of qn satisfies\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n|\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4\u00af(n)|2 qn(\u03c4 ) d\u03c4 \u2264 C1\nn2\n(n \u2265 1) (1.4)\nwhere \u03c4\u00af(n) =\n\u222b\n\u03c4qn(\u03c4 )d\u03c4 and C1 is a constant. Then the same conclusions as in (i) hold.\nWigner(18) considered the case of the Gaussian ensembles, which arise when v(x) =\nx2\/2; moreover, when the potential is uniformly convex as in (i), the generalized orthogonal\nresembles the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble in many respects, as discussed in ref. 2. The\nhypotheses of (ii) are weaker than those of (i). In section 2 of ref. 22, Pastur and Shcherbina\nassert that (1.4) holds for unitarily invariant ensembles of Hermitian matrices, under very\nmild conditions on the potential. Their proof depends upon the orthogonal polynomial\ntechnique, so does not apply to orthogonal ensembles; nevertheless, (1.4) has been verified\nfor certain orthogonal ensembles discussed below.\nThe form of the equilibrium distribution \u03c1 was determined by Boutet de Monvel et\nal.(6) for orthogonal ensembles with a wide class of Ho\u00a8lder\u2013continuous potentials. They\nshow that \u03c1 is absolutely continuous and the equilibrium density of states p(x) = d\u03c1\/dx\nsatisfies v(x) =\n\u222b\nlog |x\u2212 y| p(y)dy + c1 on the support of p for some constant c1. When v\nis non-convex, p may have several local minima and the support of p may consist of several\ndisjoint intervals; see section 2 of ref. 21. Boutet de Monvel et al.(6) show in their equation\n(2.2) that\n\u222b |\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4\u00af(n)|2qn(\u03c4 )d\u03c4 \u2264 C(logn)\/n holds for general potentials.\nIn certain cases, for instance if v is convex as in Theorem 1.1(i), then p(x) satisfies\nthe principal value integral equation\np(x) = PV\n1\npi2\n[\n(b \u2212 x)(x \u2212 a)]1\/2\n\u222b b\na\nv\u2032(u)\n(x \u2212 u)[(b\u2212 u)(u\u2212 a)]1\/2 du (x \u2208 [a, b]), (1.5)\n3\nwith constants \u2212A\/2 \u2264 a < b \u2264 A\/2 that are determined by\n\u222b b\na\np(x) dx = 1 and\n\u222b b\na\nv\u2032(u)\n[(b \u2212 u)(u\u2212 a)]1\/2 du = 0; (1.6)\nsee ref. 19. Further, when v is a polynomial, we can use Tricomi\u2019s method to solve\n(1.5). Let t2`\u22121,2k\u22121 = 2\n2\u22122k\n(\n2k\u22121\nk\u2212`\n)\nfor integers 1 \u2264 ` \u2264 k and let Uj be the Chebyshev\npolynomials of the second kind, so that Uj(cos \u03b8) = sin(j + 1)\u03b8\/ sin \u03b8 for j \u2265 0 as in ref.\n13, section 8.94. We summarize some known results.\nProposition 1.2. Let v(x) =\n\u2211m\nk=1 a2kx\n2k\/2k be an even polynomial with v(0) = 0\nand a2m > 0. Suppose that the equilibrium distribution has support [\u2212b, b] where b \u2264 A\/2.\n(1) Then b is a root of\nm\u2211\nk=1\n2\u22121a2kt1,2k\u22121b\n2k = 1, (1.7)\nand the equilibrium distribution has density\np(x) = pi\u22121\n\u221a\nb2 \u2212 x2\nm\u2211\nk=1\nk\u2211\n`=1\na2kt2`\u22121,2k\u22121b\n2k\u22121U2`\u22122(x\/b). (1.8)\n(2) Moreover, if the polynomial factor in (1.8) has no real roots, then the trace dis-\ntribution satisfies (1.4); indeed, the Gaussian concentration limit holds as n\u2192\u221e :\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nent\u03c4 qn(\u03c4 ) d\u03c4 \u2192 eb2t2\/4 (t \u2208 R). (1.9)\nProof. (1) To solve (1.5), we express v\u2032 in terms of Chebyshev polynomials of the\nfirst kind, which satisfy Tj(cos \u03b8) = cos j\u03b8. Since v is even, we can suppose that a = \u2212b\nand use the trigonometric substitution x = b cos \u03b8 in (1.5). The identity (1.8) follows easily\nfrom the identities on page 180 of ref. 25. The identity (1.7) is equivalent to the condition\nin (1.6) that p have integral equal to 1.\n(2) The trace is an example of a linear statistic in the eigenvalues, for which there is\na central limit theorem for suitable polynomial potentials; see ref. 18, p. 315. Hence (1.9)\nis a special case of Johansson\u2019s Theorem 2.4 of ref. 15. To deduce (1.4) of Theorem 1.1(ii)\nwe can take t = 1 and use Chebyshev\u2019s inequality to obtain n0 such that\n\u222b\n{\u03c4 :|\u03c4 |\u2265s}\nqn(\u03c4 ) d\u03c4 \u2264\n(\n1 + eb\n2\/4\n)\ne\u2212ns (s \u2265 0; n \u2265 n0). (1.10)\n4\nThen by integrating this concentration inequality we see that\n\u222b\n\u03c4 2qn(\u03c4 )d\u03c4 \u2264 C\/n2. See\nPropositions 6.5 and 6.6 for other conditions related to (1.4) and (1.9).\nExamples 1.3. We re-visit some examples that are discussed in ref. 6.\n(i) Proposition 1.2 applies to any convex polynomial potential, and to non-convex\npolynomials such that p(x) given by (1.9) is positive on [\u2212b, b].\n(ii) Quartic potentials are used by Bre\u00b4zin(8) et al in the planar approximation to field\ntheory with global invariance group SO(n). Let us take v(x) = x4\/4 + (\u2212\u03ba)x2\/2, which\ndefines a potential with two wells. For small positive \u03ba the equilibrium distribution is\nnevertheless supported on the interval [\u2212b, b] where b2 = 2(\u03ba +\u221a\u03ba2 + 6)\/3, and is given\nby\np(x) =\n1\npi\n\u221a\nb2 \u2212 x2\n(\nx2 \u2212 \u03ba+ b\n2\n2\n)\n. (1.11)\nWhen \u03ba < 1\/20 holds, the condition 3(2b)2\u03ba < 1 of Theorem 1.1(ii) is satisfied.\n(iii) For the sextic v(x) = x6\/6 + a4x\n4\/4 + a2x\n2\/2, it is again possible to solve (1.7),\nusing Cardan\u2019s method or Maple, and thus to obtain the coefficients of\np(x) =\n\u221a\nb2 \u2212 x2\npi\n(\nx4 +\n(\na4 +\nb2\n2\n)\nb2x2 + a2 +\n3b4\n8\n+\na4b\n2\n2\n)\n(1.12)\nexplicitly from (1.8). With \u03b4 = 120a32 \u2212 27a22a24 + 810a2a4 + 2025 \u2212 162a34 and S =\n135a2a4 + 675\u2212 27a34 + 15\n\u221a\n\u03b4 we have\nb2 =\n2S1\/3\n15\n\u2212 20a2 \u2212 6a\n2\n4\n5S1\/3\n\u2212 2a4\n5\n.\nOne can check that v(x) = x6\/6 \u2212 3x4\/8 + x2\/2 is a nonconvex polynomial to which\nTheorem 1.1(ii) applies, and in this case the equilibrium distribution is trimodal.\n(iv) For the potential v(x) = |x|p\/p with p \u2265 2, Theorem 1.6 of ref. 2 shows that\n\u03bdn{X : |\u03c4 (X)| \u2265 s} \u2264 e\u2212cpn2sp for some constant cp > 0 and all s \u2265 0. The proof of\nTheorem 1.1 in section 5 below works with this estimate.\nWe have not succeeded in obtaining a concentration inequality for any orthogonal\nensemble such that the equilibrium density is supported on more than one interval. The\nmain obstacle is the lack of any known inequality such as (1.10) in this context.\nBoutet de Monvel et al.(6) established weak convergence in probability for the \u00b5\n(\u03bb)\nn to \u03c1.\nTo obtain almost sure weak convergence, we prove a concentration inequality which shows\n5\nthat \u00b5\n(\u03bb)\nn is unlikely to deviate much from \u03c1 when n is large; it is then straightforward to\npair the measures with functions and deduce (1.3). This approach was used by the author\nin ref. 2 for uniformly convex potentials, and here we introduce significant technical\nrefinements which allow us to deal with a wider and more realistic class of potentials.\nDyson and previously Wigner considered an analogy in electrostatics to describe the\nensembles; see ref. 18 p. 70. If unit positive charge is distributed along the real line\naccording to a probability measure \u00b5 and is subject to a potential field v, then the total\nenergy is\nE(\u00b5) =\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nv(x)\u00b5(dx) \u2212 1\n2\n\u222b\u222b\n[x6=y]\nlog |x \u2212 y|\u00b5(dx)\u00b5(dy); (1.13)\nhere as in subsequent double integrals we exclude the diagonal D = {(x, x) \u2208 R2} since a\npoint charge does not repel itself. A Radon probability measure \u00b5 is of finite logarithmic\nenergy when\n\u222b \u222b\n[x6=y] | log |x \u2212 y||\u00b5(dx)\u00b5(dy) < \u221e. The \u03c1 of Theorem 1.1 is the unique\nminimizer of this E over all probability measures of finite logarithmic energy; see p.27 of\nSaff and Totik(23) and ref. 16.\nWhereas E is viewed most naturally as a functional on the probability measures on\nthe line, its convexity properties are best interpreted in the phase space \u2206n of eigenvalues\nwith its linear structure. In Theorem 2.1 we show that, for v as in Theorem 1.1, E is\ndisplacement convex in the sense of McCann(17), and hence we obtain the quantitative\neffect on E of rearranging the equilibrium configuration. In section three we consider\nthe effect of displacement on the potential energy. In the context of Theorem 1.1(ii), it\nseems to be necessary to condition the distribution of \u03bb on the values of \u03c4 when proving\ndisplacement convexity. Transportation inequalities bound from above the cost of changing\na measure \u00b5 into another measure \u03bd by the relative entropy of \u00b5 with respect to \u03bd. The\nrequired transportation inequality Theorem 4.1 follows for the conditional distribution of\neigenvalues by a procedure due to Bobkov and Ledoux(5). This implies a concentration\ninequality Theorem 4.2, with which we conclude the proof of Theorem 1.1 in section five.\nIn section six we show that, if the tracial distribution satisfies a suitable transportation\ninequality, then the unconditional joint eigenvalue distribution \u03c3n also satisfies a trans-\nportation inequality. Further, we present sufficient conditions for qn to satisfy (1.4) and\nfor \u03c3n to satisfy a transportation inequality with constants that improve with increasing\nn.\n6\nUnder these slightly stronger hypotheses we are able to deduce analogues of results\nknown in the case of Gaussian ensembles from refs. 2 and 24. Section seven features\na transportation inequality for \u03c1. Displacement convexity has also been considered by\nOtto and Villani(20), in the context of the Fokker-Planck equation, and by Carrillo et\nal.\n(9) for the granular medium diffusion equation, to establish logarithmic Sobolev and\ntransportation inequalities.\n2. DISPLACEMENT CONVEXITY OF LOGARITHMIC ENERGY\nWe begin this section by introducing some fundamental functionals to describe the\nproblem, before stating the convexity properties of the energy. The Hamiltonian for our\nsystem may be written as a function on the phase space \u2206n of ordered eigenvalues\nH(\u03bb) = n\nn\u2211\nj=1\nv(\u03bbj) \u2212\n\u2211\nj,k:j<k\nlog |\u03bbj \u2212 \u03bbk| (\u03bb \u2208 \u2206n), (2.1)\nor equivalently in terms of the empirical distribution as n2E(\u00b5\n(\u03bb)\nn ). By restricting the\nensemble, we can assume that all eigenvalues lie in [\u2212A\/2, A\/2]. On \u2206n we shall use the\nmetric associated with the norm \u2016(xj)\u2016`2(n) =\n(\n1\nn\n\u2211n\nj=1 x\n2\nj\n)1\/2\non Rn.\nLet (\u2126, d) be a complete and separable metric space and let \u00b5 and \u03bd be Radon prob-\nability measures on \u2126. When \u00b5 is absolutely continuous with respect to \u03bd, we can unam-\nbiguously define the relative entropy of \u00b5 with respect to \u03bd by\nEnt(\u00b5 | \u03bd) =\n\u222b\n\u2126\nd\u00b5\nd\u03bd\nlog\nd\u00b5\nd\u03bd\nd\u03bd,\nwhere by Jensen\u2019s inequality 0 \u2264 Ent(\u00b5 | \u03bd) \u2264 \u221e.\nWhen\n\u222b\n\u2126 d(x0, y)\np\u00b5(dy) < \u221e and \u222b\u2126 d(x0, y)p\u03bd(dy) < \u221e hold for some x0 \u2208 \u2126\nand p > 0, we define the Wasserstein p-transportation cost to be\nWp(\u00b5, \u03bd)\np = inf\npi\n{\u222b\u222b\n\u21262\nd(x, y)ppi(dxdy)\n\u2223\u2223 pi has marginals \u00b5, \u03bd}, (2.2)\nwhere the infimum is taken over all those Radon probability measures pi with the prescribed\nmarginals. The topology associated with the metric Wp for p \u2265 1 is weaker than the\ntopology of weak convergence of the probabilities. We shall use the dual characterization\nof transportation cost, due to Kantorovich and Rubinstein(11), that\nWp(\u00b5, \u03bd)\np = sup\nf,g\n{\u222b\n\u2126\nf(x)\u00b5(dx) \u2212\n\u222b\n\u2126\ng(y) \u03bd(dy)\n\u2223\u2223 f(x) \u2212 g(y) \u2264 d(x, y)p} (2.3)\n7\nwhere the functions f and g are bounded and continuous.\nA continuous map \u03c8 : (\u21261, d1) \u2192 (\u21262, d2) between complete and separable metric\nspaces is said to induce the Radon probability measure \u03c3 on \u21262 from \u03bd on \u21261 when\n\u222b\n\u21262\ng(y)\u03c3(dy) =\n\u222b\n\u21261\ng(\u03c8(x))\u03bd(dx) (g \u2208 Cb(\u21262)). (2.4)\nFor notational convenience, we shall sometimes identify an absolutely continuous prob-\nability distribution on the real line with its associated probability density function. Let\nf0 and f1 be probability density functions on [\u2212A\/2, A\/2] and let \u03d5 : [\u2212A\/2, A\/2] \u2192\n[\u2212A\/2, A\/2] be the increasing and continuous function that satisfies\n\u222b x\n\u2212A\/2\nf0(u)du =\n\u222b \u03d5(x)\n\u2212A\/2\nf1(u)du (x \u2208 [\u2212A\/2, A\/2]); (2.5)\nthen \u03d5 induces f1(u)du from f0(u)du, or, more briefly, f1 from f0. We introduce the\nincreasing and continuous functions\n\u03d5s(x) = (1 \u2212 s)x + s\u03d5(x) (x \u2208 [\u2212A\/2, A\/2], s \u2208 [0, 1]) (2.6)\nand set \u222b \u03d5s(x)\n\u2212A\/2\nfs(u)du =\n\u222b x\n\u2212A\/2\nf0(u)du (x \u2208 [\u2212A\/2, A\/2]), (2.7)\nso that (fs) (0 \u2264 s \u2264 1) is a family of probability density functions which interpolates\nbetween f0 and f1 by displacement in the sense of McCann\n(17).\nTheorem 2.1. Suppose that the probability density functions f0 and f1 on\n[\u2212A\/2, A\/2] have finite logarithmic energy.\n(i) If v\u2032\u2032(x) \u2265 \u03ba0 > 0, then the energy E of (1.13) is uniformly displacement convex;\nthat is, E(fs) is a convex function of s with\n(1 \u2212 s)E(f0) + sE(f1) \u2212E(fs) \u2265 1\n2\ns(1 \u2212 s)\u03ba0W2(f0, f1)2 (0 \u2264 s \u2264 1). (2.8)\n(ii) If v\u2032\u2032(x) \u2265 \u2212\u03ba where \u03ba < 1\/(3A2), and f0 and f1 have equal means, then the\nenergy E is uniformly displacement convex with\n(1\u2212 s)E(f0) + sE(f1)\u2212E(fs) \u2265 s(1\u2212 s)\n(1\u2212 3A2\u03ba\n6A2\n)\nW2(f0, f1)\n2 (0 \u2264 s \u2264 1). (2.9)\n8\nProof of Theorem 2.1. The proof is contained in sections two and three. First we\nrecall that the logarithmic energy associated with fs is\n1\n2\n\u222b\u222b\n[\u2212A\/2,A\/2]2\nlog\n1\n|\u03d5s(x) \u2212 \u03d5s(y)|f0(x)f0(y)dxdy. (2.10)\nThe logarithmic energy in E makes a contribution to (2.8) of\n1\u2212 s\n2\n\u222b\u222b\n[\u2212A\/2,A\/2]2\nlog\n1\n|x \u2212 y|f0(x)f0(y)dxdy +\ns\n2\n\u222b\u222b\n[\u2212A\/2,A\/2]2\nlog\n1\n|x \u2212 y|f1(x)f1(y)dxdy\n\u22121\n2\n\u222b\u222b\n[\u2212A\/2,A\/2]2\nlog\n1\n|x \u2212 y|fs(x)fs(y)dxdy\n=\n1\n2\n\u222b\u222b\n[\u2212A\/2,A\/2]2\nlog\n{ |\u03d5s(x) \u2212 \u03d5s(y)|\n|x \u2212 y|1\u2212s|\u03d5(x)\u2212 \u03d5(y)|s\n}\nf0(x)f0(y)dxdy. (2.11)\nHere \u03d5 is increasing, so it follows from the inequality of the means that\n|\u03d5s(x) \u2212 \u03d5s(y)| = |(1\u2212 s)(x \u2212 y) + s(\u03d5(x) \u2212 \u03d5(y))| \u2265 |x \u2212 y|1\u2212s|\u03d5(x)\u2212 \u03d5(y)|s; (2.12)\nhence the integrand of (2.11) is non-negative. This shows that the logarithmic energy is\ndisplacement convex, so (2.10) is convex in s; a fact which turns out to be adequate for\nthe proof of Theorem 2.1(i) in section three.\nTo obtain uniform convexity, as required for Theorem 2.1(ii), we improve upon (2.12)\nby using the inequality\nlog\n{ |\u03d5s(x) \u2212 \u03d5s(y)|\n|x\u2212 y|1\u2212s|\u03d5(x) \u2212 \u03d5(y)|s\n}\n\u2265 2\n3\ns(1\u2212 s)\n{ x\u2212 \u03d5(x) \u2212 y + \u03d5(y)\n|x \u2212 y| + |\u03d5(x) \u2212 \u03d5(y)|\n}2\n. (2.13)\nTo see this, we set \u03b8 = x \u2212 y and \u03c8 = \u03d5(x) \u2212 \u03d5(y); here we suppose without loss that\n\u03b8 > 0, and then \u03c8 > 0 holds since \u03d5 is increasing. The function\nh(s) = log((1 \u2212 s)\u03b8 + s\u03c8) \u2212 (1\u2212 s) log \u03b8 \u2212 s log\u03c8 (s \u2208 [0, 1]) (2.14)\nis concave with h(0) = h(1) = 0 and hence satisfies the simple estimates\nh(s) \u2265 2s(1 \u2212 s)h(1\/2) = 2s(1 \u2212 s) log \u03b8 + \u03c8\n2\n\u221a\n\u03b8\u03c8\n= 2s(1 \u2212 s) log\n{\n1 +\n(\n\u221a\n\u03b8 \u2212\u221a\u03c8)2\n2\n\u221a\n\u03b8\u03c8\n}\n(s \u2208 [0, 1]).\nThe mean value theorem shows that log(1 + u\/2) \u2265 2u\/3 for 0 \u2264 u \u2264 1; hence\n9\nh(s) \u2265 2\n3\ns(1 \u2212 s)\n{ \u03b8 \u2212 \u03c8\n\u03b8 + \u03c8\n}2\n(2.15)\nholds, and this is equivalent to (2.13). We deduce that\n1\n2\n\u222b\u222b\n[\u2212A\/2,A\/2]2\nlog\n{ |\u03d5s(x) \u2212 \u03d5s(y)|\n|x\u2212 y|1\u2212s|\u03d5(x)\u2212 \u03d5(y)|s\n}\nf0(x)f0(y)dxdy\n\u2265 s(1\u2212 s)\n12A2\n\u222b\u222b\n[\u2212A\/2,A\/2]2\n{\n(x \u2212 \u03d5(x)) \u2212 (y \u2212 \u03d5(y))}2f0(x)f0(y)dxdy, (2.16)\nand since f0 is a probability density function this is\n=\ns(1\u2212 s)\n6A2\n{\u222b A\/2\n\u2212A\/2\n(x \u2212 \u03d5(x))2f0(x)dx \u2212\n(\u222b A\/2\n\u2212A\/2\n(y \u2212 \u03d5(y))f0(y)dy\n)2}\n. (2.17)\nAs \u03d5 induces f1 from f0, the final integral in (2.17) vanishes\n\u222b A\/2\n\u2212A\/2\nyf0(y)dy \u2212\n\u222b A\/2\n\u2212A\/2\nyf1(y)dy = 0,\nsince f0 and f1 are assumed to have equal means.\nSudakov and Brenier(7) have shown that the most economical way of transporting f0\nto f1 is via the probability measure pi that is induced on [\u2212A\/2, A\/2]2 from f0(x)dx by\ny 7\u2192 (y, \u03d5(y)); clearly pi has marginal densities f0 and f1. Hence we have\n(2.17) =\ns(1\u2212 s)\n6A2\n\u222b A\/2\n\u2212A\/2\n(x \u2212 \u03d5(x))2f0(x)dx = s(1\u2212 s)\n6A2\nW2(f0, f1)\n2, (2.18)\nwhich is our basic estimate on the effect on the logarithmic energy of displacing the charge\ndistribution. In the next section we shall conclude the proof of Theorem 2.1 by considering\nthe potential energy.\n3. DISPLACEMENT CONVEXITY FOR GENERAL POTENTIALS\nProposition 3.1. Suppose that v\u2032\u2032(x) \u2265 \u03b1 for all x \u2208 [\u2212A\/2, A\/2]. Then the potential\nenergy satisfies\n(1 \u2212 s)\n\u222b A\/2\n\u2212A\/2\nv(x)f0(x)dx + s\n\u222b A\/2\n\u2212A\/2\nv(x)f1(x)dx\u2212\n\u222b A\/2\n\u2212A\/2\nv(x)fs(x)dx\n\u2265 \u03b1s(1\u2212 s)\n2\nW2(f0, f1)\n2. (3.1)\nThe potential energy is displacement convex whenever v is convex; the potential energy is\nuniformly displacement convex whenever \u03b1 = \u03ba0 > 0.\n10\nThis result is known to McCann and others(26), but for the sake of completeness, we\ninclude the proof.\nProof of Proposition 3.1. It follows from the mean value theorem that for x, y \u2208 R\nand s \u2208 [0, 1], there exists s\u00af \u2208 (0, 1) such that\n(1\u2212 s)v(x) + sv(y) \u2212 v((1\u2212 s)x + sy) = 1\n2\ns(1 \u2212 s)(x \u2212 y)2v\u2032\u2032((1\u2212 s\u00af)x+ s\u00afy). (3.2)\nSince \u03d5s induces fs from f0, we can write\n(1\u2212 s)\n\u222b A\/2\n\u2212A\/2\nv(x)f0(x)dx + s\n\u222b A\/2\n\u2212A\/2\nv(x)f1(x)dx \u2212\n\u222b A\/2\n\u2212A\/2\nv(x)fs(x)dx\n=\n\u222b A\/2\n\u2212A\/2\n{\n(1\u2212 s)v(x) + sv(\u03d5(x)) \u2212 v(\u03d5s(x))\n}\nf0(x)dx, (3.3)\nwhere we can apply (3.2) with y = \u03d5(x) to the latest integrand and thereby obtain the\nbound\n(3.3) \u2265 \u03b1\n2\ns(1 \u2212 s)\n\u222b A\/2\n\u2212A\/2\n{\n\u03d5(x) \u2212 x}2f0(x)dx. (3.4)\nThe statement of the Proposition follows as with (2.18).\nConclusion of the proof of Theorem 2.1. (i) When the potential is uniformly convex,\nwe can take \u03b1 = \u03ba0 > 0 in Proposition 3.1. On adding (2.11) and (3.4), we obtain the\nrequired result (2.8).\n(ii) When the potential satisfies the weaker estimate v\u2032\u2032 \u2265 \u2212\u03ba, and the densities have\nequal means, we obtain (2.9) by adding (2.18) to (3.4). This concludes the proof.\nWe now consider the consequences for the empirical distribution of eigenvalues, as\nrequired for Theorem 1.1.\nCorollary 3.2. (i) For v as in Theorem 2.1(i), the Hamiltonian is uniformly convex\nwith\n(1\u2212 s)H(\u03bb) + sH(\u03be) \u2212H((1 \u2212 s)\u03bb + s\u03be) \u2265 2\u22121n2s(1\u2212 s)\u03ba0\u2016\u03bb\u2212 \u03be\u20162`2(n) (\u03bb, \u03be \u2208 \u2206n).\n(ii) For v as in Theorem 2.1(ii), the Hamiltonian satisfies\n(1 \u2212 s)H(\u03bb) + sH(\u03be) \u2212H((1 \u2212 s)\u03bb + s\u03be) \u2265 n2s(1 \u2212 s)\n(1\u2212 3A2\u03ba\n6A2\n)\n\u2016\u03bb\u2212 \u03be\u20162`2(n) (3.5)\n11\nfor all \u03bb, \u03be \u2208 \u2206n \u2229 [\u2212A\/2, A\/2]n with \u2211nj=1 \u03bbj = \u2211nj=1 \u03bej .\nProof. This may be verified directly as in the proof of Theorem 2.1.\n4. CONDITIONAL TRANSPORTATION AND CONCENTRATION\nIn ref. 14, Its et al. consider matrix ensembles, in which the eigenvalues \u03bb =\n(\u03bb1, . . . , \u03bbn) are constrained to lie on a hyperplane, as a model for a random word problem;\nhere we consider such an ensemble as a technical device. Let I[\u2212A\/2,A\/2] be the indicator\nfunction of [\u2212A\/2, A\/2], and let\n\u03c3n(d\u03bb) = Z\n\u22121\nn exp\n{\u2212H(\u03bb)}I[\u2212A\/2,A\/2](\u03bb1) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 I[\u2212A\/2,A\/2](\u03bbn)d\u03bb1d\u03bb2 . . . d\u03bbn (4.1)\nbe the probability measure on \u2206n that is induced from \u03bd\u02dcn(dX) by the eigenvalue map\n\u039b : X 7\u2192 \u03bb. Ref. 18 p. 56 features a discussion of this formula.\nIt is convenient to condition measures with respect to the values taken by the normal-\nized trace \u03c4 = 1n\n\u2211n\nj=1 \u03bbj . Let qn be the probability density function, induced by \u03bb 7\u2192 \u03c4 ,\nthat satisfies\n\u222b A\/2\n\u2212A\/2\nf(\u03c4 )qn(\u03c4 ) d\u03c4 =\n\u222b\n\u2206n\nf\n( 1\nn\nn\u2211\nj=1\n\u03bbj\n)\n\u03c3n(d\u03bb) (f \u2208 Cb(R)). (4.2)\nIt is important to distinguish qn from the integrated density of states, which involves\n1\nn\n\u2211n\nj=1 f(\u03bbj ) instead of f(\n1\nn\n\u2211n\nj=1 \u03bbj) in (4.2), since their limiting behaviour is quite\ndifferent; in fact, qn(\u03c4 ) d\u03c4 converges weakly to \u03b4x\u00af as n \u2192 \u221e where x\u00af =\n\u222b\nxp(x)dx. We\nsuppose that \u03c3n(d\u03bb) = \u03c3n,\u03c4 (d\u03c7)qn(\u03c4 )d\u03c4 where \u03c3n,\u03c4 is the conditional probability measure\non\n\u03a0n\u03c4 =\n{\n\u03bb \u2208 Rn : 1\nn\nn\u2211\nj=1\n\u03bbj = \u03c4\n}\n\u2229\u2206n \u2229 [\u2212A\/2, A\/2]n. (4.3)\nThis set is the closure of the intersection of a hyperplane in Rn with a convex open set, so\nhas a natural Lebesgue measure d\u03c7 upon it, and we take the metric on \u03a0n\u03c4 to be the `\n2(n)\nmetric restricted to the said hyperplane. We shall use \u03c7 to denote a vector parallel to \u03a0n\u03c4 ,\nso that \u03bb = (\u03c4, \u03c7) \u2208 \u03a0n\u03c4 .\nIn this section we consider the joint distribution of eigenvalues of a random matrix\nsubject to \u03bd\u02dcn(dX). We shall assume as in Theorem 1.1(ii) that 3A\n2\u03ba < 1 holds, and derive\na concentration-of-measure theorem, itself a consequence of the following transportation\n12\ninequality. Under the stronger hypotheses of Theorem 1.1(i), similar results hold with\nbetter constants as in Theorem 2.1(i); see section 6 of ref. 2.\nTheorem 4.1. Let \u03c9n,\u03c4 be a probability measure on \u03a0\nn\n\u03c4 that is absolutely continuous\nand of finite relative entropy with respect to \u03c3n,\u03c4 . Then the quadratic transportation cost\nis bounded by the relative entropy and satisfies\nW2(\u03c9n,\u03c4 , \u03c3n,\u03c4 )\n2 \u2264 6A\n2\nn2(1\u2212 3A2\u03ba)Ent(\u03c9n,\u03c4 | \u03c3n,\u03c4 ). (4.4)\nProof. This follows from Corollary 3.2(ii) by Proposition 4.2 of Bobkov and Ledoux(5).\nUltimately, their poof depends upon the Pre\u00b4kopa\u2013Leindler inequality.\nThe following concentration inequality is the functional form of Theorem 4.1, and we\nshall use it in the proof of almost sure convergence in Theorem 1.1(ii).\nTheorem 4.2. Let F : (\u03a0n\u03c4 , `\n2(n)) \u2192 R be an L-Lipschitz function, so that\n|F (\u03bb) \u2212 F (\u03be)| \u2264 L\u2016\u03bb\u2212 \u03be\u2016`2(n) for some L <\u221e and all \u03bb, \u03be \u2208 \u03a0n\u03c4 . Suppose further that\u222b\nF (\u03bb)\u03c3n,\u03c4 (d\u03c7) = 0. Then\n\u222b\n\u03a0n\u03c4\nexp{tF (\u03bb)}\u03c3n,\u03c4 (d\u03c7) \u2264 exp\n{ 3t2L2A2\n2n2(1\u2212 3A2\u03ba)\n}\n(t \u2208 R). (4.5)\nProof. This follows from Theorem 1.3 of Bobkov and Go\u00a8tze(4); see also p. 342 of\nVillani(26).\nWe now present a logarithmic Sobolev inequality which formally strengthens Theorem\n4.1. The precise connection betweem logarithmic Sobolev inequalities and transportation\ninequalities is discussed on p. 297 of Villani(26) within the unifying context of HWI in-\nequalities.\nTheorem 4.3. Let g : \u03a0n\u03c4 \u2192 R be an L2(\u03c3n,\u03c4 ) function such that \u2016\u2207g\u2016`2(n) also\nbelongs to L2(\u03c3n,\u03c4 ).

(4.6)\nProof. This follows from Proposition 3.2 of Bobkov and Ledoux(5).\n13\n5. ALMOST SURE WEAK CONVERGENCE\nIn this section we conclude the proof of Theorem 1.1 by arguments which exploit\nTheorem 4.2; compare ref. 2. The empirical distribution \u00b5\n(\u03bb)\nn is defined in (1.2).\nProposition 5.1. Suppose that v is as in Theorem 1.1. Then the empirical eigenvalue\ndistribution converges weakly almost surely to the equilibrium distribution \u03c1 as n\u2192\u221e.\nProof. We shall concentrate on part (ii) of Theorem 1.1, this being the more difficult.\nBy the Weierstrass approximation theorem, it suffices to prove (1.3) for an arbitrary L-\nLipschitz function f : [\u2212A,A] \u2192 R. We set\nFn(\u03bb) =\n\u222b A\n\u2212A\nf(x)\u00b5(\u03bb)n (dx) (5.1)\nso that Fn : (\u2206\nn, `2(n)) \u2192 R defines an L-Lipschitz function. We introduce the means\nmn,\u03c4 =\n\u222b\n\u03a0n\u03c4\nFn(\u03bb)\u03c3n,\u03c4 (d\u03c7) and mn =\n\u222b\n\u2206n\nFn(\u03bb)\u03c3n(d\u03bb), (5.2)\nso that mn =\n\u222b\nmn,\u03c4qn(\u03c4 )d\u03c4 holds by definition of \u03c3n,\u03c4 and the limit\nmn \u2192 m :=\n\u222b A\n\u2212A\nf(x)\u03c1(dx) (n\u2192\u221e) (5.3)\nholds by the weak convergence theorem of ref. 6.\nGiven \u03b5 > 0, we shall prove that the sequence of probability values\n\u03c3n{\u03bb \u2208 \u2206n : |Fn(\u03bb) \u2212m| > \u03b5} =\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\u03c3n,\u03c4{\u03bb \u2208 \u03a0n\u03c4 : |Fn(\u03bb) \u2212m| > \u03b5}qn(\u03c4 )d\u03c4 (5.4)\nis summable over n \u2265 1. To this end, we bound the right\u2013hand side from above by\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n(\n\u03c3n,\u03c4{\u03bb \u2208 \u03a0n\u03c4 : |Fn(\u03bb) \u2212mn,\u03c4 | > \u03b5\/4}+ \u03c3n,\u03c4\n[|mn,\u03c4 \u2212mn,\u03c4\u00af(n)| > \u03b5\/4]\n+ \u03c3n,\u03c4\n[|mn,\u03c4\u00af(n) \u2212mn| > \u03b5\/4] + \u03c3n,\u03c4 [|mn \u2212m| > \u03b5\/4]\n)\nqn(\u03c4 ) d\u03c4. (5.5)\nThe concentration Theorem 4.2 leads via Chebyshev\u2019s inequality to the bound\n\u03c3n,\u03c4\n{\n\u03bb \u2208 \u03a0n\u03c4 : |Fn(\u03bb) \u2212mn,\u03c4 | > \u03b5\/4\n}\n\u2264 2 exp\n{\u2212\u03b5t\n4\n+\n3A2L2t2\n2(1\u2212 3A2\u03ba)n2\n}\n14\nand hence\n\u03c3n,\u03c4\n{\n\u03bb \u2208 \u03a0n\u03c4 : |Fn(\u03bb) \u2212mn,\u03c4 | > \u03b5\/4\n}\n\u2264 2 exp\n{\u2212n2(1\u2212 3A2\u03ba)\u03b52\n96A2L2\n}\n; (5.6)\nthe constants here are independent of \u03c4 . This gives a satisfactory bound on the first term\nin (5.5).\nThe final term in (5.5) contributes zero for all sufficiently large n, independently of \u03c4 ,\non account of (5.3).\nSo it remains to bound the second and third terms of (5.5), which we do by establishing\nLipschitz continuity of mn,\u03c4 with respect to \u03c4. For notational correctness, we introduce\nthe probability measure \u03c3\u02dcn,\u03c4 that is induced on \u03a0\nn\n\u03c4 from \u03c3n,\u03c4 by the isometric map \u03a6 :\n(\u03bbj) 7\u2192 (\u03bbj + \u03c4\u00af(n) \u2212 \u03c4 ), which changes the trace from \u03c4 to \u03c4\u00af(n). We have\nmn,\u03c4\u00af(n) \u2212mn,\u03c4 =\n\u222b\n\u03a0n\n\u03c4\u00af (n)\nF (\u03bb)\u03c3n,\u03c4\u00af (n)(d\u03bb)\u2212\n\u222b\n\u03a0n\n\u03c4\u00af(n)\nF (\u03bb) \u03c3\u02dcn,\u03c4 (d\u03bb)\n+\n\u222b\n\u03a0n\u03c4\n(\nF (\u03a6(\u03bb)) \u2212 F (\u03bb))\u03c3n,\u03c4 (d\u03bb) (5.7)\nand since F is L-Lipschitz, this latest integral is bounded in modulus by L\u2016\u03a6(\u03bb)\u2212\u03bb\u2016`2(n) \u2264\nL|\u03c4\u2212\u03c4\u00af (n)|. It follows from the Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality theorem (2.3) and Theorem\n4.1 that\n|mn,\u03c4\u00af(n) \u2212mn,\u03c4 | \u2264 LW1(\u03c3n,\u03c4\u00af (n), \u03c3\u02dcn,\u03c4 ) + L|\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4\u00af(n)|\n\u2264 L\n(cA\nn2\nEnt\n(\n\u03c3n,\u03c4\u00af(n) | \u03c3\u02dcn,\u03c4\n))1\/2\n+ L|\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4\u00af(n)| (5.8)\nfor some constant cA. In analogy with (2.1) and (4.1), the measures \u03c3n,\u03c4\u00af(n) and \u03c3\u02dcn,\u03c4 arise\nfrom Hamiltonians which have difference\nH\u03c3n,\u03c4\u00af (n) (\u03bb) \u2212H\u03c3\u02dcn,\u03c4 (\u03bb) = n\nn\u2211\nj=1\n{\nv(\u03bbj) \u2212 v(\u03bbj + \u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4\u00af(n))\n}\nsince \u03a6 does not affect the logarithmic energy term in (2.1), and the ratio of the normalizing\nconstants of these probability measures is\nZ(\u03c3\u02dcn,\u03c4 )\nZ(\u03c3n,\u03c4\u00af(n))\n=\n\u222b\n\u03a0n\n\u03c4\u00af(n)\nexp{\u2212H\u03c3\u02dcn,\u03c4 (\u03bb)}d\u03c7\u222b\n\u03a0n\n\u03c4\u00af(n)\nexp{\u2212H\u03c3n,\u03c4\u00af (n)(\u03bb)}d\u03c7\n.

This establishes that the \u00b5(\u03bb)n converge almost\nsurely to \u03c1 in the weak topology as n\u2192\u221e.\n6. TRANSPORTATION INEQUALITIES\nIn this section we present sufficient conditions for \u03c3n to satisfy a quadratic transporta-\ntion inequality similar to (4.4). Having already achieved such a result for the eigenvalue\ndistributions conditioned on the trace, we need to consider the tracial distribution qn(\u03c4 ) d\u03c4.\nTheorem 6.1. Let v be as in Theorem 1.1(ii) and suppose that |v\u2032\u2032| \u2264 K2 on\n[\u2212A\/2, A\/2]. Suppose further that the tracial density function satisfies the quadratic trans-\nportation inequality\nW2(pn, qn)\n2 \u2264 (1\/\u03b1n)Ent(pn | qn) (6.1)\nfor all probability density functions pn that are of finite relative entropy with respect to\nqn. Then \u03c3n also satisfies the quadratic transportation inequality\nW2(wn, \u03c3n)\n2 \u2264 max\n{ 9A4K22\n\u03b1n(1 \u2212 3A2\u03ba)2 ,\n6A2\nn2(1\u2212 3A2\u03ba)\n}\nEnt(wn | \u03c3n) (6.2)\nfor any probability measure wn that is absolutely continuous and of finite relative entropy\nwith respect to \u03c3n.\nProof of Theorem 6.1. We let gn(\u03c4, \u03c7) = dwn\/d\u03c3n, and also introduce gn,\u03c4 (\u03c7) =\ngn(\u03c4, \u03c7)\/hn(\u03c4 ), where hn(\u03c4 ) =\n\u222b\n\u03a0n\u03c4\ngn(\u03c4, \u03c7)\u03c3n,\u03c4 (d\u03c7) is so chosen that gn,\u03c4 is a probabil-\nity density function with respect to \u03c3n,\u03c4 . Further, hn is a probability density function\nwith respect to qn(\u03c4 )d\u03c4. We shall obtain the Theorem from two lemmas which describe\nthe quadratic transportation cost and the relative entropy. Talagrand(24) considered the\ncorresponding results for product measures.\n17\nLemma 6.2. Let \u03d5 : [\u2212A\/2, A\/2] \u2192 [\u2212A\/2, A\/2] be the continuous function that\ninduces hn(\u03c4 )qn(\u03c4 )d\u03c4 from qn(\u03c4 )d\u03c4. Then the Wasserstein distances for the quadratic\ntransportation cost satisfy\n3\u22121W2(wn, \u03c3n)\n2 \u2264\n\u222b A\/2\n\u2212A\/2\nW2(gn,\u03c4\u03c3n,\u03c4 , \u03c3n,\u03c4 )\n2hn(\u03c4 )qn(\u03c4 )d\u03c4\n+W2(hnqn, qn)\n2 +\n\u222b A\/2\n\u2212A\/2\nW2(\u03c3n,\u03d5(\u03c4), \u03c3n,\u03c4 )\n2qn(\u03c4 )d\u03c4. (6.3)\nProof. By the triangle inequality we have\nW2(gn,\u03c4\u03c3n,\u03c4hnqn, \u03c3n,\u03c4 qn) \u2264W2(gn,\u03c4\u03c3n,\u03c4hnqn, \u03c3n,\u03c4hnqn)\n+W2(\u03c3n,\u03c4hnqn, \u03c3n,\u03d5(\u03c4)qn) +W2(\u03c3n,\u03d5(\u03c4)qn, \u03c3n,\u03c4 qn) (6.4)\nand we can square up this inequality if we introduce the constant 3. We let \u03c8\u03c4 : \u03a0\nn\n\u03c4 \u2192 \u03a0n\u03c4\nbe the optimal transportation map that induces gn,\u03c4 (\u03c7)\u03c3n,\u03c4 (d\u03c7) from \u03c3n,\u03c4 (d\u03c7) at minimal\nW2-cost. Then (\u03c4, \u03c7) 7\u2192 (\u03c4, \u03c8\u03c4 (\u03c7)) induces gn,\u03c4\u03c3n,\u03c4hnqn from \u03c3n\u03c4hnqn and hence\nW2(gn,\u03c4\u03c3n,\u03c4hnqn, \u03c3n,\u03c4hnqn)\n2 \u2264\n\u222b A\/2\n\u2212A\/2\n{\u222b\n\u03a0n\u03c4\n\u2016\u03c8\u03c4 (\u03c7) \u2212 \u03c7\u20162`2(n)\u03c3n,\u03c4 (d\u03c7)\n}\nhn(\u03c4 )qn(\u03c4 )d\u03c4\n(6.5)\nsince the \u03c4 distribution is unchanged. As \u03c8\u03c4 is the optimal transportation map, we can\nidentify the inner integral with the minimal transportation cost for the \u03c7-distribution and\nobtain\nW2(gn,\u03c4\u03c3n,\u03c4hnqn, \u03c3n,\u03c4hnqn)\n2 \u2264\n\u222b A\/2\n\u2212A\/2\nW2(gn,\u03c4\u03c3n,\u03c4 , \u03c3n,\u03c4 )\n2hn(\u03c4 )qn(\u03c4 )d\u03c4. (6.6)\nHence the first term on the right\u2013hand side of (6.4) gives rise to the first term on the\nright\u2013hand side of (6.3).\nLikewise, the final term in (6.4) gives rise to the final term in (6.3); when \u03c3n is the\nproduct of qn(\u03c4 )d\u03c4 with another measure, this term is zero since then \u03c3n,\u03c4 = \u03c3n,\u03d5(\u03c4).\nIt remains to deal with the middle term in (6.4). The map (\u03c4, \u03c7) 7\u2192 (\u03d5(\u03c4 ), \u03c7) induces\n\u03c3n,\u03c4hnqn from \u03c3n,\u03d5(\u03c4)qn since\n\u222b\u222b\nG(\u03d5(\u03c4 ), \u03c7)\u03c3n,\u03d5(\u03c4)(d\u03c7) qn(\u03c4 )d\u03c4 =\n\u222b\u222b\nG(\u03c4, \u03c7)\u03c3n,\u03c4 (d\u03c7)hn(\u03c4 )qn(\u03c4 ) d\u03c4 (6.7)\n18\nholds by the choice of \u03d5. Further, since the \u03c7- co-ordinate is unchanged, the cost is\nW2(\u03c3n,\u03c4hnqn, \u03c3n,\u03d5(\u03c4)qn)\n2 \u2264\n\u222b A\/2\n\u2212A\/2\n|\u03d5(\u03c4 )\u2212 \u03c4 |2qn(\u03c4 ) d\u03c4 = W2(hnqn, qn)2.\nThis accounts for the remaining term in (6.3) and concludes the proof of Lemma 6.2.\nLemma 6.3.

(6.10)\nThe identity (6.8) follows when we rearrange this, and the proof of the Lemma is complete.\nConclusion of the proof of Theorem 6.1. We obtain in turn upper bounds on each of\nthe transportation costs in Lemma 6.2 in terms of corresponding expressions from Lemma\n6.3. First we have, by the hypothesis (6.1) and (6.8),\nW2(hnqn, qn)\n2 \u2264 (1\/\u03b1n)Ent(hnqn | qn) \u2264 (1\/\u03b1n)Ent(wn | \u03c3n). (6.11)\nFor the other terms in (6.3) we exploit Theorem 4.1. We have the inequality\n\u222b A\/2\n\u2212A\/2\nW2(gn,\u03c4\u03c3n,\u03c4 , \u03c3n,\u03c4 )\n2hn(\u03c4 )qn(\u03c4 ) d\u03c4\n\u2264 6A\n2\nn2(1\u2212 3A2\u03ba)\n\u222b A\/2\n\u2212A\/2\nEnt(gn,\u03c4\u03c3n,\u03c4 | \u03c3n,\u03c4 )hn(\u03c4 )qn(\u03c4 ) d\u03c4, (6.12)\nand by Lemma 6.3 this is\n\u2264 6A\n2\nn2(1\u2212 3A2\u03ba)Ent(wn | \u03c3n). (6.13)\n19\nTo deal with the remaining term we introduce the Radon-Nikodym derivative Sn,\u03c4 =\nd\u03c3n,\u03d5(\u03c4)\/d\u03c3n,\u03c4 and apply Theorem 4.1 to obtain\nW2(Sn,\u03c4\u03c3n,\u03c4 , \u03c3n,\u03c4 )\n2 \u2264 6A\n2\nn2(1\u2212 3A2\u03ba)Ent(Sn,\u03c4\u03c3n,\u03c4 | \u03c3n,\u03c4 ), (6.14)\nand by Theorem 4.3 we have the logarithmic Sobolev inequality\nEnt(Sn,\u03c4\u03c3n,\u03c4 | \u03c3n,\u03c4 ) \u2264 6A\n2\n(1\u2212 3A2\u03ba)\n\u222b\n\u03a0n\u03c4\n\u2225\u2225\u2207\u03c7\u221aSn,\u03c4\u2225\u22252`2(n)\u03c3n,\u03c4 (d\u03c7) (6.15)\nwhere \u2207\u03c7 is the projection of the gradient onto \u03a0n\u03c4 . Now we can write \u03bb = \u03c7 + \u03c4a where\na = (1, . . . , 1) so that \u03c7 = (\u03c7j) has\n\u2211n\nj=1 \u03c7j = 0. In terms of these co-ordinates, (2.1)\ngives, after we cancel the logarithmic terms,\nlogSn,\u03c4 = n\nn\u2211\nj=1\nv(\u03c7j + \u03c4 )\u2212 v(\u03c7j + \u03d5(\u03c4 )) + Cn (6.16)\nfor some constant Cn, and this has gradient with norm\n\u2016\u2207\u03c7 logSn,\u03c4\u20162`2(n) = n\nn\u2211\nj=1\n\u2223\u2223v\u2032(\u03c7j + \u03c4 )\u2212 v\u2032(\u03c7j + \u03d5(\u03c4 ))\u2223\u22232\n\u2264 n2K22 (\u03d5(\u03c4 )\u2212 \u03c4 )2 (6.17)\nsince |v\u2032\u2032| \u2264 K2. Hence on combining (6.17), (6.15) and (6.14) we obtain\nW2(Sn,\u03c4\u03c3n,\u03c4 , \u03c3n,\u03c4 )\n2 \u2264 9A\n4K22\n(1\u2212 3A2\u03ba)2 (\u03d5(\u03c4 )\u2212 \u03c4 )\n2 (6.18)\nand so\n\u222b A\/2\n\u2212A\/2\nW2(\u03c3n,\u03d5(\u03c4), \u03c3n,\u03c4 )\n2qn(\u03c4 ) d\u03c4 \u2264 9A\n4K22\n(1\u2212 3A2\u03ba)2\n\u222b A\/2\n\u2212A\/2\n(\u03d5(\u03c4 )\u2212 \u03c4 )2qn(\u03c4 ) d\u03c4. (6.19)\nSince \u03d5 is the optimal transportation map that takes qn(\u03c4 ) d\u03c4 to hn(\u03c4 )qn(\u03c4 ) d\u03c4 , we recog-\nnise this as\n9A4K22\n(1 \u2212 3A2\u03ba)2W2(hnqn, qn)\n2.\nWe can now bound this term by a multiple of Ent(wn | \u03c3n) as in (6.11). Having bounded\neach of the transportation costs in Lemma 6.2, we have achieved a proof of Theorem 6.1.\n20\nExamples 6.4. (i) Let v be as in Theorem 1.1(i). Then the potential is uniformly\n2-convex and conclusion of Theorem 6.1 holds by Theorems 1.4 and Lemma 6.3 of ref. 2;\nsee also Bobkov and Ledoux(5). In particular when v(x) = x2\/2, we have the classical\nWigner ensemble GOE(n, 1\/n) where \u03c4 has a Gaussian N(0, n\u22122) distribution and the\nquadratic transportation constant satisfies 1\/\u03b1n \u2264 2\/n2 by Talagrand\u2019s theorem(24).\n(ii) Let v be a polynomial potential as in Proposition 1.2. Then v satisfies the Gaus-\nsian concentration inequality (1.10). By results of ref. 3 and Otto and Villani(20) it is\nknown that the slightly stronger Gaussian isoperimetric inequality implies the quadratic\ntransportation inequality.\nThe hypotheses of Theorem 6.1 imply that qn(\u03c4 ) \u2248 exp{\u2212cn2(\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4\u00af(n))} holds for\nsome c > 0 in the sense of the theory of large deviations; see ref. 12. In the remainder of\nthis section, we shall make this more precise. Since qn is a one-dimensional distribution,\nwe can express the value of the quadratic transportation constant in terms of computable\nquantities. Otto and Villani(20) show, under the general conditions of their Theorem 1,\nthat the transportation constant \u03b1n in (6.1) is equivalent to the constant in the logarithmic\nSobolev inequality\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nh(\u03c4 ) log h(\u03c4 ) qn(\u03c4 ) d\u03c4 \u2264 1\n4\u03b1n\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n|\u2207\n\u221a\nh(\u03c4 )|2 qn(\u03c4 ) d\u03c4 (6.20)\nwhich holds for all probability density functions h of finite relative information with respect\nto qn. Let the cumulative distribution function of qn be Qn(x) =\n\u222b x\n\u2212A\/2\nqn(t) dt and the\ntail be Tn(x) =\n\u222b A\/2\nx\nqn(t) dt; the median an satisfies Qn(an) = 1\/2. We introduce the\nconstants\nB(1)n = sup\nx\u2264an\nQn(x)\n{\nlog\n1\nQn(x)\n}\u222b an\nx\ndt\nqn(t)\n(6.21)\nand\nB(2)n = sup\nx\u2265an\nTn(x)\n{\nlog\n1\nTn(x)\n}\u222b x\nan\ndt\nqn(t)\n. (6.22)\nThen by Theorem 5.3 of Bobkov(4) and Go\u00a8tze, there exist absolute positive constants c(1)\nand c(2) such that\nc(1)(B(1)n +B\n(2)\nn ) \u2264 1\/\u03b1n \u2264 c(2)(B(1)n +B(2)n ). (6.23)\n21\nFurther, they show that the logarithmic Sobolev inequality implies a Gaussian concentra-\ntion inequality, as in Theorem 4.2, and (1.10).\nThe following result shows that the distribution of tracenv\n\u2032(X) is tightly concentrated\nnear to its mean value; the inequality resembles (1.9), which holds for special polynomial\npotentials. For notational convenience, we use the unconditioned ensemble \u03bdn on M\ns\nn(R).\nProposition 6.5. Suppose that v is twice continuously differentiable with v\u2032\u2032(x) \u2264 K,\nand that |v(x)| \u2265 cx2 holds for some c > 0 and all large |x|. Then V \u2032(X) = 1n\n\u2211n\nj=1 v\n\u2032(\u03bbj )\nsatisfies\n\u222b\nV \u2032(X) \u03bdn(dX) = 0 and\n\u222b\nMsn(R)\nexp{t nV \u2032(X)}\u03bdn(dX) \u2264 exp\n{Kt2\n2\n}\n(t \u2208 R). (6.24)\nProof. We investigate the effect of translating X to X + tI; compare Lemma 1 of\nref. 22. Since X and I commute, by checking the case of polynomial potentials and\nusing the Weierstrass approximation theorem, we can easily show that d\nk\ndtk\nV (X + tI) =\ntracenv\n(k)(X + tI), when v is k-times continuously differentiable and hence we deduce the\ninequality\nV (X + tI) \u2264 V (X) + t tracenv\u2032(X) +Kt2\/2 (6.25)\nby the mean value theorem.\nThe growth condition on v and the dominated convergence theorem allow us to ma-\nnipulate the following integrals. The measure dX is translation invariant, and hence\n1 =\n\u222b\nMsn(R)\n\u03bdn(dX) = Z\n\u22121\nn\n\u222b\nMsn(R)\nexp{\u2212n2V (X + tI)}dX; (6.26)\nso the t-derivative of the right\u2013hand side is zero, and\n1 \u2265Z\u22121n\n\u222b\nMsn(R)\nexp{\u2212n2Kt2\/2\u2212 n2t tracenv\u2032(X) \u2212 n2V (X)}dX (6.27)\nholds on account of (6.25). After rearranging, we obtain the desired result by replacing t\nby \u2212t\/n.\nDue to Lemma 1 of ref. 6 as mentioned in the Introduction, it is the bounds of v\u2032\u2032 on\n[\u2212A\/2, A, 2] that are important in applications of Proposition 6.5. We can now compute\nthe asymptotic form of the variance of V \u2032(X).\n22\nProposition 6.6. Suppose that v is a real analytic function that satisfies the condi-\ntions of Proposition 6.5. Then V \u2032\u2032(X) = 1\nn\n\u2211n\nj=1 v\n\u2032\u2032(\u03bbj ) satisfies\n\u222b\nMsn(R)\nV \u2032(X)2\u03bdn(dX) =\n1\nn2\n\u222b\nMsn(R)\nV \u2032\u2032(X)\u03bdn(dX) (6.28)\nand \u222b\nMsn(R)\nV \u2032\u2032(X)\u03bdn(dX) \u2192 1\n2pi\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n|\u03be||p\u02c6(\u03be)|2 d\u03be (n\u2192\u221e). (6.29)\nProof. We obtain (6.28) from (6.26) by differentiating twice and setting t = 0. By\nresults from ref. 6, the empirical distribution is weakly convergent in probability to the\nequilibrium distribution, hence the limit in (6.29) exists and has value\n\u222b\nv\u2032\u2032(x)p(x)dx. To\nexpress the limit as a Fourier transform, we need to justify some computations. For v as in\nthe Proposition, the equilibrium measure is supported on a finite union of disjoint intervals\n[aj , bj ], and on each [aj , bj ] its density p has the form p(x) =\n\u221a\n(bj \u2212 x)(x \u2212 aj )rj (x), where\nrj(x) \u2265 0 is real and analytic; see ref. 10. It follows that p is bounded and vanishes at\nthe endpoints of its supporting intervals, and that p\u2032 belongs to L4\/3(R) since p\u2032 has\nsingularities no worse than x\u22121\/2. Further, we can integrate by parts to obtain\n\u222b A\/2\n\u2212A\/2\nv\u2032\u2032(x)p(x) dx = \u2212\n\u222b A\/2\n\u2212A\/2\nv\u2032(x)p\u2032(x) dx (6.30)\nwhere, on the support of p, this v\u2032 equals the Hilbert transform of p by results mentioned\nin the introduction. It follows from the Hausdorff\u2013Young inequality that \u03bep\u02c6(\u03be) belongs to\nL4(R) and p\u02c6(\u03be) belongs to L4\/3(R). Hence we can apply Plancherel\u2019s formula to (6.30) and\nthus obtain the stated value for the limit.\n7. TRANSPORTATION OF THE EQUILIBRIUM DISTRIBUTION\nTheorem 7.1. Let v be as in Theorem 1.1(ii), and suppose that the tracial distri-\nbution satisfies the quadratic transportation inequality (6.1) with 1\/\u03b1n \u2264 \u03b2\/n2 for some\n\u03b2 > 0; alternatively, suppose that v is as in Theorem 1.1(i). Suppose further that the\nequilibrium density p has support [\u2212A\/2, A\/2], and let q be a probability density function\non [\u2212A\/2, A\/2] with q log q integrable. Then the quadratic transportation cost satisfies,\nfor some \u03b3 > 0 independent of q,\nW2(q, p)\n2 \u2264 1\n\u03b3\n\u222b\u222b\nlog\n1\n|x\u2212 y| (p(x) \u2212 q(x))(p(y) \u2212 q(y)) dxdy. (7.1)\n23\nThus the quadratic transportation cost is bounded by the logarithmic energy of q\u2212p.\nThe right\u2013hand side is equivalent to the squared norm of p \u2212 q in the Sobolev space\nH\u02d9\u22121\/2[\u2212A,A]; that is, to \u2211\u2032 1|k| |p\u02c6(k)\u2212 q\u02c6(k)|2 where the Fourier coefficients are taken with\nrespect to (exp{ipikx\/A})\u221ek=\u2212\u221e where k 6= 0.\nProof. We recall that\nv(x) =\n\u222b\nlog |x \u2212 y| p(y) dy + c1 (x \u2208 [\u2212A\/2, A\/2]) (7.2)\nwhere c1 is a constant which cancels later. Let u(x) =\n\u222b\nlog |x\u2212y|q(y)dy, so that u defines\na bounded function on [\u2212A\/2, A\/2]; indeed by Young\u2019s inequality\nu(x) \u2264\n\u222b A\/2\n\u2212A\/2\nq(y) log q(y) dy +\n1\ne\n\u222b A\/2\n\u2212A\/2\n|x\u2212 y| dy\n=\n\u222b A\/2\n\u2212A\/2\nq(y) log q(y) dy +\nA2\n2e\n. (7.3)\nThe function u is absolutely continuous and its derivative u\u2032(x) = PV\n\u222b\n(1\/(x\u2212y)) q(y)dy is\nintegrable by Kolmogorov\u2019s Theorem on the Hilbert transform; in particular, u is Ho\u00a8lder\ncontinuous. Since q satisfies (1.8)-(1.12) of ref. 6, it is the unique probability density\nfunction on [\u2212A\/2, A\/2] that has u as its logarithmic potential.\nNow we introduce\n\u03c9n(d\u03bb) = Zn(u)\n\u22121 exp\n{\n\u2212n\nn\u2211\nj=1\nu(\u03bbj) +\n\u2211\nj,k:j<k\nlog |\u03bbj \u2212 \u03bbk|\n} n\u220f\nj=1\nI[\u2212A\/2,A\/2](\u03bbj)d\u03bb1 . . . d\u03bbn\n(7.4)\nwhere Zn(u) is so chosen as to make \u03c9n(d\u03bb) be a probability measure on \u2206\nn; here 0 <\nZn(u) <\u221e holds since u is bounded. This \u03c9n(d\u03bb) has finite relative entropy with respect\nto \u03c3n(d\u03bb) and\n1\nn2\n\u222b\n\u2206n\nd\u03c9n\nd\u03c3n\nlog\nd\u03c9n\nd\u03c3n\nd\u03c3n =\n1\nn2\nlog\nZn\nZn(u)\n+\n\u222b\n\u2206n\n1\nn\nn\u2211\nj=1\n(\nv(\u03bbj) \u2212 u(\u03bbj)\n)\n\u03c9n(d\u03bb). (7.5)\nBy Theorem 1 of ref. 6 we have weak convergence of the empirical eigenvalue distri-\nbutions under \u03c9n(d\u03bb); hence\n\u222b\n\u2206n\n1\nn\nn\u2211\nj=1\nv(\u03bbj)\u03c9n(d\u03bb) \u2192\n\u222b\nR\nv(x)q(x) dx =\n\u222b\u222b\nR2\nlog |x\u2212 y| p(y)q(x)dydx + c1 (7.6)\n24\nas n\u2192\u221e, and similarly\n\u222b\n\u2206n\n1\nn\nn\u2211\nj=1\nu(\u03bbj)\u03c9n(d\u03bb) \u2192\n\u222b\nR\nu(x)q(x) dx =\n\u222b\u222b\nR2\nlog |x \u2212 y| q(y)q(x) dxdy. (7.7)\nThe latest iterated integral is finite since u is bounded and q is integrable.\nBy Jensen\u2019s inequality applied to (7.5), we have\n1\nn2\nlog\nZn\nZn(u)\n\u2264\n\u222b\n\u2206n\n1\nn\nn\u2211\nj=1\n(\nu(\u03bbj) \u2212 v(\u03bbj)\n)\n\u03c3n(d\u03bb) (7.8)\nand hence by weak convergence\nlim sup\nn\u2192\u221e\n1\nn2\nlog\nZn\nZn(u)\n\u2264\n\u222b\nR\n(\nu(x) \u2212 v(x))p(x) dx. (7.9)\nThe right\u2013hand side of (7.9) may be simplified using (7.2) and the definition of u to\n\u222b\u222b\nR2\nlog |x\u2212 y| (q(y) \u2212 p(y))p(x) dxdy \u2212 c1.\nWe deduce from (7.6) that\nlim sup\nn\u2192\u221e\n1\nn2\n\u222b\n\u2206n\nd\u03c9n\nd\u03c3n\nlog\nd\u03c9n\nd\u03c3n\nd\u03c3n \u2264\n\u222b\u222b\nR2\nlog\n1\n|x\u2212 y|\n(\np(x)\u2212q(x))(p(y)\u2212q(y))dxdy. (7.10)\nMoving attention to the left\u2013hand side of (7.1), we can introduce, for each \u03b5 > 0,\ncontinuous functions f and g with f(x) \u2212 g(y) \u2264 |x\u2212 y|2 on [\u2212A\/2, A\/2] and such that\nW2(q, p)\n2 \u2264\n\u222b\nR\nf(x)q(x) dx \u2212\n\u222b\nR\ng(y)p(y) dy + \u03b5\n\u2264\n\u222b\n\u2206n\n1\nn\nn\u2211\nj=1\nf(\u03bbj )\u03c9n(d\u03bb) \u2212\n\u222b\n\u2206n\n1\nn\nn\u2211\nj=1\ng(\u03bej)\u03c3n(d\u03be) + 2\u03b5 (7.11)\nholds for all sufficiently large n. It follows from the choice of f and g that\nW2(q, p)\n2 \u2264\n\u222b\u222b\n\u2206n\u00d7\u2206n\n\u2016\u03bb\u2212 \u03be\u20162`2(n)pin(d\u03bbd\u03be) + 2\u03b5 (7.12)\nholds for all probability measures pin on \u03a0\nn\n\u03c4 \u00d7\u03a0n\u03c4 with marginals \u03c9n(d\u03bb) and \u03c3n(d\u03be). By\nTheorem 6.1, \u03c3n satisfies a quadratic transportation inequality with constant 1\/(\u03b3n\n2) for\nsome \u03b3 > 0. We deduce from the definition of transportation cost and (7.12) that\nW2(q, p)\n2 \u2264 lim sup\nn\u2192\u221e\nW2(\u03c9n, \u03c3n)\n2 \u2264 lim sup\nn\u2192\u221e\n1\n\u03b3n2\n\u222b\n\u2206n\nd\u03c9n\nd\u03c3n\nlog\nd\u03c9n\nd\u03c3n\nd\u03c3n. (7.13)\n25\nThe result follows when we combine (7.13) with (7.10).\nRemark. When v(x) = x2 and we have the semicircle law p(x) = 2\n\u221a\n1\u2212 x2\/pi for\n\u22121 < x < 1, the inequality (7.1) simplifies to Biane(1) and Voiculescu\u2019s Remark 2.9. The\nconstants arising from our double integral are equivalent to those of ref. 1; checking this\nis a pleasant exercise in the theory of the Gamma function.\nACKOWLEDGEMENTS\nI am grateful to G.
