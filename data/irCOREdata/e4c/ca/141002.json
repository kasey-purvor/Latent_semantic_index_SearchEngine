Introduction\nMuch has been written about the low cost airline business model and what\nelements in the business model distinguish it from traditional full service airlines.\nWilliams and Mason (2004) reviewed the group of strategies that together enable\nlow cost carriers to exercise cost advantages over full service airlines (p.8) (see\nalso Francis, et.al, 2003). The review highlighted significant differences between\nlow cost carriers in their business models. For some carriers it is not clear if they\nshould be called \u201clow cost carrier\u201d, \u201cregional carrier\u201d, or some other term. When\ncomparing airline performance it is useful to compare one airline with others of a\nsimilar business approach and contrast it with other airline pursuing alternative\nmodels. However, the fundamental problem is that is a lack of a consistent and\nstandardised approach to analysing airline business models. This paper seeks to go\nsomeway towards rectifying this methodological gap.\n2. Product and organizational architecture\nSynthesizing complex airline business models requires the identification of key\ncomponents of the product architecture \u2013 the service quality elements that define\nthe product relative to consumer preferences, and organizational architecture \u2013 the\nvertical structure, production and distribution choices of the airline. A conceptual\nframework can be developed to consider both the product and organisational\narchitecture of firms. Such a product and organizational architecture (POA)\napproach can be applied directly to airline business models. Figure 1 illustrates the\ngeneral POA approach to defining a firm\u2019s business model and its competitive\nenvironment. On the one hand, product architecture gives rise to a core product\nbundle that positions the firm in terms of consumer preferences (benefit drivers)\nand the competitive environment (as defined by the market structure). On the\nother hand, the product design also implies a choice set for inputs and possible\norganizational structures (cost drivers) which define the firm\u2019s cost position. Taken\ntogether, both product and organizational architecture contribute to the creation\nand sustainability of profits.\n2.1 Applying the POA model to airlines\nFigure 2 shows an application of the POA approach to airline business models. By\nso doing we aim to develop a means by which airlines can be consistently\ncompared. Product architecture is separated into three elements of service quality:\nconnectivity, convenience and comfort. These three elements have the\nproperty that they follow a general ordering with respect to the degree with which\ncosts are fixed or \u2018avoidable\u2019. In particular, connectivity implies a choice of\nnetwork design that distinguishes hub-and-spoke (airline-supplied connectivity)\nfrom point-to-point (passenger-supplied) networks. This is perhaps the most\nimportant core element that can distinguish between different airline business\nmodels.\nSome of the elements of convenience are linked to network structure decisions,\nbut nevertheless imply a lesser degree of fixed investment for some airlines. In\nparticular, use of primary airports and \u2018checked-through\u2019 baggage services tend to\nfollow from the\nchoice of a hub-and-spoke network, however an airline operating a point-point\nnetwork may also choose to offer convenience through use of a primary airport.\nElements of comfort in determining the quality of service are to some degree more\nvariable than the other two categories, yet these elements will vary in importance\nfor the overall architecture of the product. In some markets elements of comfort\nmight be regarded as \u2018frills\u2019 while in other markets the same elements could be\nregarded as more essential; the offering of in-flight meals on short haul versus\nlong-haul flights for example. The 3Cs thus define the product in relation to\nconsumer preferences, which impacts market demand within the competitive\nenvironment. However the 3Cs also impact the magnitude and avoidability of\nproduction costs which in turn affects pricing flexibility and the airline\u2019s competitive\nposition.\n2.1.1 Organizational architecture\nWithin the organizational architecture the size and composition of the fleet along\nwith the organizational design are elements that follow on primarily from the\nproduct architecture. In particular, the decision over network structure is key\nbecause the complexity of operating a hub-and-spoke network requires certain\nfunctions relating to coordination, yield management, etc. which implies a more\nvertically integrated organization. In contrast, an airline operating a point-to-point\nnetwork has relatively more opportunities to form a \u2018nexus of contracts\u2019\norganizational structure in which many functions are contracted out.\nIn terms of distribution, all airlines now take advantage of internet based booking\nsystems, yet even here point-to-point network carriers can offer more simplicity in\nthe process with implications for both cost and benefit drivers\nFIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE\nFIGURE 2 ABOUT HERE\n2.1.2 Using indices to form benchmark metrics in the POA model\nIn an attempt to functionalise the conceptual POA model, a dataset of benchmark\nmetrics has been developed. By developing separate indices for different elements\nin the business model the interaction between the items and the importance of\neach item to the overall performance of each airline can be more easily identified\nand their impact on the overall performance assessed.\nThe indices were developed for each of the following areas:\n\uf0b7 Profitability\n\uf0b7 Cost drivers\n\uf0b7 Revenue achievement\n\uf0b7 Connectivity\n\uf0b7 Convenience\n\uf0b7 Comfort\n\uf0b7 Distribution\/Sales\n\uf0b7 Aircraft productivity\n\uf0b7 Labour productivity\n\uf0b7 Airports Attractiveness\n\uf0b7 Market Structure\nThe profitability index was constructed using just the operating ratio of the\ncarriers in the benchmark group.\nWhile profitability identifies the overall success of the business, an airline\u2019s unit cost\n(operating cost per ASK) summaries that various organizational architecture\ndecisions made. It summarises the key cost values for the airline. The cost driver\nindex is therefore a summary of the carriers\u2019 strategies with respect of IT,\ndistribution and sales, aircraft, labour, and the airports served. Each of these\nitems (with the exception of IT1) are treated with a separate index as detailed\nbelow.\nThe Revenue Index is a measure of the revenue side of the carriers\u2019 businesses\nand incorporates a number of revenue benchmarks. The prime measure is yield\nper RPK. Also included is operating revenue per sector (GBP). This will highlight\ndifferences between the large aircraft\/high density aircraft and the smaller\naircraft\/higher yield operators. The final benchmark item included here is a simple\n1 The IT infrastructure within an airline can have significant influence over that business\u2019 costs.\nUnfortuanately, IT costs are not routinely reported in airline annual reports and therefore a separate IT\nindex has not been possible to construct.\nmeasure of average fare paid per passenger (this incorporates ancillary revenues\nwhere these are reported separately).\nWhile some airlines have quite a dense network from their main base, the coverage\nof their network elsewhere may be quite limited and therefore the number of\ndeparture per airport per day indicates the coverage of the network. The\nconnectivity index, therefore, seeks to calculate an index of network density. It is\ncalculated from four benchmark statistics: the number of departures per airport per\nday; the average frequencies per route per week; the number of routes offered and\nthe total number of destinations available at the airport. For some airlines in a\ngrowth phase a strategy of serving a large number of small markets is pursued\n(e.g. Ryanair), while some other low cost carriers seek to usurp the short haul\nnetworks of traditional full service carriers (e.g. EasyJet).\nSome airlines position themselves as providing a more convenient service by\nhaving a higher frequency of service, using airports either better located or with\nbetter surface transport links than those offered to alternative airports. They also\npromote a punctual service, and offer improved baggage services. For the\nConvenience Index the following benchmarks were included; the average weekly\nfrequency per route2, the weighted average distance of the airport served to the\ncity centre; the proportion of flights offered from primary airports, the proportion of\nflights departed on within 15 minutes, and the Skytrax3 baggage score.\nTo measure on-board comfort the seat pitch and seat width was included in the\nComfort Index. The average number of passengers per flight was also included\nwith fewer passengers per flight assumed to be more comfortable than more4. The\n2 While this benchmark statistic is also included in the connectivity index it is also a clear measure of\nconvenience.\n3 Skytrax ratings for baggage handling for General handling, on-board baggage policy, excess baggage\npolicy were aggregated and used for this rating.\n4 Although it is recognised that, depending on the type of aircraft equipment, smaller aircraft are not\nnecessarily more comfortable for passengers than larger aircraft.\nfinal variable included in index is the number of passengers per flight-and-cabin-\ncrew member.\nChanges to the distribution strategy of many carriers have been remarkable since\nlow cost airlines began using the internet as their principal distribution channel in a\nbid to reduce their costs in this area. Two variables are included in the\nDistribution\/Sales Index; the percentage of sales made via the airline\u2019s online\nreservation system; and the airline\u2019s cost per passenger of ticketing, sales and\npromotion (TSP).\nThe Aircraft Productivity Index looks at both the daily utilisation of an airline\u2019s\nfleet and also the number of sectors each aircraft operates a day. While average\nsector length will affect each airline\u2019s ability to improve utilisation it is not included\nin this index as it can be used later to assess sector length impacts on the various\nperformance indices. The uniformity of the fleet has often been highlighted as one\nof the key cost saving items for low cost airlines. A third variable in this index is\nthen the percentage that the most populous aircraft type\/mark accounts for in the\nfleet \u2013 this importance of fleet uniformity may therefore be assessed.\nThe Labour Productivity Index has four items contributing the aggregate index\nvalue. The index summarises the airline\u2019s employees productivity in relation to the\nnumber of passengers uplifted, and ASKs, the cost of personnel (per ASK). One\narea where carriers have recently been able to reduce costs is in the reduction of\nnon-flying employees (e.g. in 2003 and 2004 British Airways reduced employee\nnumbers significantly with the vast majority of loses coming from staff employed in\nnon-flying roles). Therefore a higher proportion of flying employees is likely to\nincrease employee productivity and this ratio is also included in this index. To\nrecognize and try to reflect the effect of outsourcing that might otherwise inflate\nthe employees productivity ratings, the passengers per employee ratio has been\ndeflated by the percentage of total costs are accounted for by employee costs. This\nproportion may be considered a proxy measure for amount of outsourcing that a\ncompany does. If the proportion of employee costs over total costs is small then it\nis more likely that the airline outsourced operational activities, whereas an airline\nwith a higher proportion of employee costs over total costs are likely to have\nundertaken more operational activities in-house. The authors recognize the\npotential flaws using this ratio to adjust the benchmark labour productivity variable\n(i.e. one airline pays considerably lower wages), however outsourcing is a\nsignificant part of the low cost model and the degree to which an airline outsources\nis very difficult to measure from published sources. Therefore this proxy for\noutsourcing is used to deflate labour productivity measures.\nOne of the key sources of lower costs that some low cost carriers have been able to\nachieve has been in airport charges. The Airport Attractiveness Index attempts\nto rate the airlines\u2019 success at managing this cost item. Four benchmark variables\nare included. Firstly the airport\/en-route cost per passenger is calculated.\nSecondly, smaller airports are likely to offer lower landing fees and thus a variable\nis included for the weighted average annual passengers at the airport. Where an\nLCC operates to an airport with higher number of full service carriers present the\nopportunity to negotiate lower fares is reduced, and thus the third variable included\nis the weighted average number of full service carriers at the airports served.\nFinally the percent of city pair routes that are monopolies provides a measure of\nhow important the airline is to the airport and thus a measure of negotiating power.\nThe final index provides a measure of the market structures that each airline\noperates within. The median and average HHI scores are calculated across each\nairline\u2019s network. This Market Structure Index also incorporates the average\nnumber of competitors per route each airline faces, the average city size served\nand the average share of capacity (by seats) per route.\n2.1.3 Index calculation methodology\nTo demonstrate the use of the POA model to consistently compare airline business\nmodels it was applied to the European LCC sector using six sample airlines. The\nairlines considered were; EasyJet, Ryanair, Norwegian, Flybe, SkyEurope and Air\nBerlin for both fiscal years 2005 and 2006. Where possible the items in the\nconceptual model were included in the analysis. As the benchmarks are calculated\nusing published data sources (generally the annual reports of the various airlines in\nquestion and Air Transport Intelligence5), not every item in the conceptual model\ncould be mapped directly by the benchmarks. However, every attempt has been\nmade to construct a benchmark dataset that as closely reflects the items in the\nconceptual model.\nThe airlines in the sample represent a range of business models and inclusion of a\ntwo year\u2019s of data for each airline means that changes in business model or\nperformance can be identified. In an earlier draft of this work (presented at ATRS\n2006) the authors presented an integrated index that aimed to describe the airline\nin a spectrum of low cost airline business models. However subsequent work has\nshown that the interaction between the various elements described above in the\nbusiness model tend to be lost in the benchmarking process by aggregating items\ntogether. Consequently, here a number of separate indices have been developed.\nThe methodology adopted to calculate the eleven index scores per airline is based\non \u201cbest in class\u201d performance by the sample airlines for each item benchmarked.\nFor most benchmarks the highest score represents the \u201cbest in class\u201d \u2013 e.g. ASKs\nper employee \u2013 if each employee produces a large number of ASKs the\n5 www.rati.com\nperformance of the airline\u2019s employee productivity is likely to be high. In some\ncases the \u201cbest in class\u201d is the lowest score \u2013 e.g the airline that achieves the\nlowest unit costs per ASK in the benchmark pool is clearly the \u201cbest in class\u201d. In\nsome cases the directional preference of the benchmark is not obvious and a value\njudgment is required. For example, when considering network density it is not\nclear whether the best airline is the one that has the highest or lowest network\ndensity. In this case the \u201cbest in class\u201d is considered to be the airline with the\nhighest benchmark statistic and the aggregate index is used to see further examine\nthe impact of the network decisions on the performance of the airline.\nThe benchmark values for the sample airlines in 2006 are detailed in the table\nbelow. The variables included in each index are shown.\nTABLE 1 ABOUT HERE\nOf the airlines in the benchmark panel Ryanair and easyJet were both profitable in\nboth selected years. Newly established Sky Europe is some way off profitability.\nRecently established Norwegian and FlyBe (which changed its operation from\nregional services to low cost carrier services in 2002), are profitable in one of the\ntwo years. Air Berlin that is the third largest carrier of the group behind Ryanair\nand EasyJet has moved into a profitable position in 2006 after beginning to refocus\nits operations in the low cost sector over the past couple of years. Ex-regional\ncarrier, FlyBe is the only one of the carriers that operates a number of different\naircraft and does not have either B737 or A320 type aircraft in its fleet.\nCalculation of Maximum \u201cBest in Class\u201d Index\nThe following calculation procedures were applied to calculate each Index. For\nitems that for which the highest score was considered \u201cBest in Class\u201d the following\nthe highest score was identified. For each airline (and for each year) a ratio was\ncalculated for dividing the airline\u2019s performance by the \u201cbest in class\u201d value.\nBenchmark Ratio = Airline\u2019s performance\/Best in class performance\nHere the top mark available will be 1.0 and this will be achieved by the \u201cbest in\nclass\u201d performer. The other airlines in the sample will be allocated a mark that\nrepresents their performance as a percentage of the best in class. For example,\nthe following calculation was performed to establish EasyJet\u2019s 2006 performance\nratio in the Profitability\/Operating benchamark area.\n\uf0b7 Best in class = 132.4% Op profit (achieved in this case by Ryanair in 2005)\n\uf0b7 EasyJet, 2005 = 108.7% Op profit\nTherefore\nEasyJet 2006 Op Profit Benchmark Ratio = 105.1\/132.4 = 0.79\nIn other words easyJet\u2019s operating profit performance is 79% that of Ryanair\u2019s.\nCalculation of Minimum \u201cBest in Class\u201d Index\nFor calculating a benchmark ratio for items where a minimum value was considered\nthe \u201cbest of class\u201d the ratio was constructed to place the performance of the\nindividual airline on a continuum from \u201cbest in class\u201d to \u201cworst in class\u201d\nBenchmark Ratio = (Worst in Class \u2013 Airline Performance)\/(Worst in Class \u2013 Best in\nClass)\nFor example, again looking at easyJet\u2019s performance in 2005, this time considering\nunit cost\n\uf0b7 Best in Class = 2.30 pence per ASK (achieved by Ryanair in 2006)\n\uf0b7 Worst in Class = 8.48 pence per ASK (Flybe, 2005)\n\uf0b7 EasyJet, 2005 = 3.97 pence per ASK\nEasyJet Unit Cost Benchmark Ratio = (8.48 \u2013 3.97)\/(8.48 \u2013 2.30) = 0.73\nHere the worst performer in the benchmark group will achieve a zero benchmark\nratio. The advantage of this approach is that it draws all airlines within the\nbenchmark sample group across a range from zero (the worst) to one (the best).\nDue to the requirement to include a \u201cworst in class\u201d value in the calculation to\nestablish the range of values the ratio indicates where in that spectrum of\nperformance each airline is. In this case easyJet\u2019s performance is 73% along the\nspectrum for worst to best.\n2.1.4 Application of Weighting\nIn the calculation of each index it was felt appropriate that some items in each\nindex made a greater contribution to the final index and therefore a weighting\nprocess was applied. The weights were based on a correlation of the benchmark\nitem against profitability. The range of weight values can be from zero to one with\none carrying the greatest weight. For each index a calculation is made to apply the\nweight to each benchmark ratio item and then a total is summed.\nWeighted score = ((scorea * weighti)+(scoreb * weightii)+\u2026+(scorez * weightn))\/\uf0e5weights i- n\nTABLE 2 ABOUT HERE\n2.1.5 Calculation of Final Index\nThis final indexing places all airlines in relationship with the best performer in the\narea of analysis (such as Cost, Profitability, or Revenue, etc.). The score is\ncalculated by establishing a ratio of the weighted score for each airline over the\nhighest\/best weighted score.\nFinal Index = Weighted Score\/Best Weighted Score*10\nThe results of the index calculations for the sampled airlines in the table below.\nTABLE 3 ABOUT HERE\n2.2 Analysis of Indices\nBy calculating separate indices for different areas of the business model, it is\npossible to develop a correlation matrix (Table 4).\nTABLE 4 ABOUT HERE\nThe matrix reveals some interesting relationships. While cost is, as expected for\nlow cost carriers, correlated with profitability (with a correlation coefficient of 0.27),\nthe poor profitability of SkyEurope (which ironically has very low costs) has drawn\ndown the correlation from 0.54 if they had been excluded from the benchmark\ngroup. The labour index is highly correlated with profitability (0.86). As for most\nairlines, labour is the single largest controllable cost it is not surprising that those\nairlines that are best at getting high productivity from their labour will be more\nlikely to be profitable. Indeed there is a very high correlation between the cost\nand labour indicies indicating that low cost airlines that achieve high labour\nproductivity are a long way toward ensuring low costs. Aircraft productivity is also\nhighly correlated to profitability indicating that a successful low cost carrier will\nwork its aircraft assets very hard. Two indicies that are reasonably well correlated\nto profitability is connectivity and airports (with correlation coefficients of 0.47 and\n0.59 respectively). The airlines in the benchmark group that have the best\nprofitability tend also to have larger networks, offer more routes or have higher\ndensity networks. The airline with the best profitability (Ryanair) also has a large\nproportion of monopoly routes in small, secondary networks and face limited\ncompetition from full service carriers.\nTwo key indicies that are inversely correlated to profitability for this panel of\nbenchmark low cost carriers are convenience and comfort, whilst being correlated\nwith the revenue index. This would suggest that in the low cost sector providing\nadditional levels of comfort to customers and chasing higher yielding passengers\ndoes not attain the best financial rewards. The high inverse correlation between\nthe revenue and cost indicies seem to suggest that the pursuit of higher yields and\nlower cost are mutually exclusive. In this airline sector carriers need to focus on\ncosts and productivity rather than moving into a middle ground where higher levels\nof comfort and higher yields are provided and sought.\n2.3 Key findings on the low cost carrier sector revealed\nby application of the POA model\nThe original concept for this research was to highlight the point that airlines that\ncalled themselves \u201clow cost\u201d did not necessarily have the lowest costs, and that\nwithin the sector a number of different business models were being practiced. The\nconcept was extended to highlight differences in business models. In an earlier\nworking paper (Morrison and Mason, 2007) we concluded that more than one LCC\nmodel might be possible but more work was required on the indexes and the\nbenchmark data that supports them. From here the POA concept was formulated to\ntest this hypothesis. The two figures that follow lay out the index profiles of the six\nbenchmark airlines in 2006. The further a carrier is toward the outermost point on\na spoke the closer they are to being the best in class for that particular index. A\nscore of 10 for a particular index means the airline is the best in class. We can see\nthat Ryanair has a profile that is best in six of the eleven indexes (and as such it is\nalso included in the second chart for reference). They are best in class for\nprofitability, cost, distribution, labour, airport attractiveness, and market structure.\nThey are second best for aircraft productivity. It would seem therefore that, in this\nbenchmarking exercise, Ryanair is best in delivering an organizational architecture\nthat attains the best profitability. Part of that success leads to, and derives from, a\nmarket structure where they dominate the small markets that they serve. It is in\nthe product architecture area where Ryanair is not the best in class. In fact, it is\nworst in class for Revenue, Comfort and Convenience. It would seem that the\ncarriers that pursue revenues backed by additional comfort and convenience are\nthose that have failed to achieve good profitability suggesting that such a model\nthat is less successful in the low cost sector.\nFIGURE 3 ABOUT HERE\nFIGURE 4 ABOUT HERE\nConnectivity remains the index that does not have a clear outcome. Ryanair scores\nmore highly than Flybe, Norwegian and SkyEurope on account of its significantly\nhigher number of routes. EasyJet has the best connectivity index scores due to its\nhigher network density, higher frequencies, and tendency to serve larger airports\nthat have more available destinations. However, easyJet\u2019s network density has\nfallen consistently since 2003 when it had 12 departures per airport per day and an\naverage weekly flight frequency of 32.6 per route. In 2006 the airline had reduced\nits number of departures per airport per day to 9.4 and reduced its weekly average\nfrequency per route to 18.6 \u2013 still the highest in the benchmark panel but a\nsignificant change in strategy. As new European countries entered the EU, both\nRyanair and EasyJet have been looking to extend their network and increase the\nnumber of routes offered. Ryanair, with its already low density strategy, has done\nso without further thinning its network density, however, easyJet\u2019s new strategy of\nnetwork expansion has been at the cost of its route density and flight frequency.\nDuring this period of new opportunities, first mover advantage would seem to have\nbeen important. However, it is still not clear at this time whether network\nconnectivity is vital to the success of a LCC and it will be a couple of more year\u2019s\nbefore this becomes clear.\nFIGURE 5 ABOUT HERE\nFigure 6 provides a clear illustration of the cost implications of product design by\nrelating the cost and comfort indexes of the airlines. The figure shows that Ryanair\ndisplay low levels of comfort but enjoying the best cost index in the benchmark\npanel. In contrast Sky Europe with high crew to passenger ratios and lower\naverage passengers per flight and FlyBe with the advantage of smaller aircraft have\nthe best comfort index values but low cost index scores.\nFIGURE 6 ABOUT HERE\nRegarding sector length, most of the carriers in the benchmark panel have average\nstage lengths of between 800 and 1,100 km. With the inclusion of newly purchased\ndba (formerly BA owned Deutsche BA) in its figures, Air Berlin has significantly\nchanged it operating pattern in 2006 and joins all other benchmark airlines with the\nexception of FlyBe in the central range of average sector lengths. As a previously\nregional carrier offering very short sectors FlyBe offer a different model to those\noffered by the rest of the benchmark group. It\u2019s marginal profitability suggests\nthat it model is not particularly successful however its performance is no worse\nthan Norwegian or Air Berlin that follow the normal low cost model more closely.\nFIGURE 7 ABOUT HERE\nWhile there most carriers in the benchmark group have similar average stage\nlengths, one important part of the low cost model is the effective use of aircraft\nassets. The two leading carriers, Ryanair and EasyJet both get more flights per day\nout of their aircraft assets than the other carriers in the panel. Additional flights\nper day mean more opportunities to share the cost of aircraft ownership and\noverhead cost over a larger number of passengers. Given the significantly shorter\nsector lengths it flies, Flybe may be able to increase the number of sectors it\noperates per day and thereby, possibly, contribute to making its model a success.\nFIGURE 8 ABOUT HERE\n2.4 Conclusion\nMeaningful definitions of and distinctions between airline business models are not\neasily formulated, particularly when one considers the extremely dynamic nature of\nthe industry. In order to provide a more coherent and consistent understanding of\nairline competition and strategy, we have applied a product and organizational\narchitecture (POA) approach to classifying and relating key elements of airline\nbusiness models.\nThe application of the POA model to six European airlines has shown that there are\nimportant differences in the business models of airlines who are all commonly\nreferred to as \u2018low cost carriers\u2019. Our paper demonstrates how differences in the\nbusiness models adopted by the different airlines contribute to their profitability.\nMore specifically, amongst the sample airlines examined, our analysis suggests that\nthe positioning of some airlines to offer increased comfort and convenience in a bid\nto achieve higher yields is marginally successful but is not as profitable as the pure\nlow cost approach practised by Ryanair.\nThere may well be a first mover advantage enjoyed by Ryanair and EasyJet.\nCertainly size and market power are shown to contribute to the POA strategy of\nboth airlines. Yet, we can see that even between these two airlines, Ryanair stands\nalone as the lowest-cost carrier, providing some indication that strategically, when\none airline establishes a lowest cost position in its product and organizational\narchitecture, competitors are forced to choose a different POA strategy. Casual\nsupport for this is provided by recent marketing efforts by Easyjet, aimed at driving\nup the proportion of traffic that is business related. The direct objective of\ntargeting this market is to drive up yield, but there is also strategic value adjusting\ntheir POA strategy thereby avoiding head-to-head direct competition with their\nlowest-cost competitor.\nThe analysis presented here can be extended in two ways. First by continuing to\ncollect data covering a larger number of years, we can investigate how the POA of\nairlines in the sample have evolved over time. Secondly, the POA model can\nusefully be applied to analyse other airline models (subject to availability of data) \u2013\nfull service carriers, premium only cabin carriers, long haul low cost carriers \u2013 and\nbetween carriers in similar sectors in different regions \u2013 low cost airlines in North\nAmerica, Europe and Asia.\nMason and Morrison\n19\nAcknowledgements\nWe wish to acknowledge intellectual and financial support from the Centre for\nTransportation Studies at the University of British Columbia, Canada and\nparticularly that of Prof David Gillen.
