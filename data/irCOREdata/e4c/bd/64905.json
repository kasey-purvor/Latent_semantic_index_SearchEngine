Corresponding author: chris.pollock@bbsrc.ac.uk\nIntroduction\nLong-distance interactions between sources and\nsinks in plants affect both photosynthesis and carbon\npartitioning (Farrar et al. 2000). Both increased\nphotosynthesis and reduction of sink activity may result\nin the accumulation of carbohydrates in leaves. Sucrose\nand starch are the major immediate products of\nphotosynthesis although some plant species accumulate\na range of other carbohydrates (Pollock et al. 1999).\nAccumulation of sugars in leaves can be associated with\na decline in the activities of enzymes involved in\ncarbohydrate synthesis and ultimately result in feed\nback inhibition of both sucrose synthesis and\nphotosynthesis (Stitt 1996, Farrar et al. 2000). The\nextent of feed back inhibition varies from plant to plant.\nIn plants such as soybean, cotton and cucumber, which\nstore starch in their leaves, feed back inhibition is\nobserved, while there is less evidence of inhibition in\nplants like spinach which store sucrose in their leaves\n(Goldschmidt & Huber 1992). Studies on fructan-\naccumulating monocots (which store very little starch\nin the leaves) indicate that photosynthetic down-\nregulation is minimal, perhaps due to the vacuolar\nsequestration of carbohydrate (Farrar et al. 2000). In a\nprevious paper, we described the partitioning of carbon\nin leaves of Lamium album L. (Kochhar et al. 2003).\nL. album was used because raffinose family\nA. Kochhar et al.: Source-sink balance in Lamium album534\noligosaccharides (RFOs) are major products of\nphotosynthesis along with sucrose and starch, and this\nspecies therefore provides a contrast between high\nstarch leaves and those of low-starch fructan-\naccumulators. Measurement of carbohydrate content\nshowed that sucrose and starch were more abundant\nthan RFOs in leaves of L. album grown under moderate\nirradiance with high sink activity (Kochhar et al. 2003).\nWe suggested that only sucrose was synthesized at the\nbeginning of the light period, with RFO and\/or starch\nsynthesis becoming significant later in the photoperiod.\nIn the study reported here, the activities of the\nmajor sinks (roots and flowers) were reduced in order\nto decrease sink demand. The effects of the resulting\naccumulation of photosynthetic products on carbon\npartitioning, photosynthesis and enzyme activities were\ndetermined. It is generally accepted that the activities\nof enzymes of both sucrose synthesis (e.g. sucrose\nphosphate synthase (SPS; Kerr & Huber 1987, Gerhardt\net al. 1987) and sucrose degradation (e.g. invertase;\nHuber 1989) are regulated by the concentration of\nsucrose inside the cytosol. Sucrose accumulation may,\ntherefore, be associated with the inhibition of SPS and\nthe stimulation of the activities of invertase isoforms\n(Walker et al. 1997, Kingston-Smith et al. 1998).\nMaterial and methods\nPlant cultivation and physiological treatments - Plants of\nLamium album L. (white dead nettle) were grown\nhydroponically from cuttings in controlled environment\nconditions as described previously (Kochhar et al. 2003).\nGrowth temperature was 20 \u00baC, photoperiod 12 h, irradiance\n500 - 550 \u00b5Em-2s-1. Carbon partitioning, photosynthesis and\nenzyme activities were measured under two contrasting\nconditions. In sink\u2013limited (treated) plants, roots were chilled\nby circulating ethylene glycol at 4 \u00baC through the nutrient\nsolution and developing flowers were pinched off.\nExperiments were begun thirty-six h after sink manipulation\nwas imposed. This delay overcame the direct effects of\ntreatment on stomatal closure. Control plants were grown\nwithout any sink manipulation.\nGas exchange measurements - Measurements were made on\nfully-mature leaves at a range of times during the photoperiod\non a number of occasions following sink manipulation. For\ncomparative purposes, only the results for the third\nphotoperiod after sink manipulation are presented. Net CO2\nexchange, transpiration, stomatal conductance and\nintercellular CO2 concentrations were measured using a PP\nSystems CIRAS-1 gas analyser with a clip-on leaf cuvette\n(Lewis et al. 1999). A\nmax\n values were measured using a\nHansatech leaf disk oxygen electrode under saturating\nirradiance and CO2 concentrations (Housley & Pollock 1985).\nFeeding 14CO2 to intact plants of  L. album - Replicate groups\nof ten hydroponically-grown plants were taken for 14CO2\nfeeding. Because of the opposed pattern of leaf development\nin L. album, two feeding chambers were constructed, each of\nwhich held ten source leaves, each from a different plant.\nThese chambers were arranged in parallel, with the plants in\nbetween them, inside a larger perspex chamber (123 \u00d7 29 \u00d7\n41 cm). Connectors were sealed into the large chamber to\nallow coolant to be circulated through the root nutrient\nsolution and there were fans on the upper surface to promote\nair movement. The two feeding chambers (112 \u00d7 7.5 \u00d7 2.5 cm)\nhad removable lids and the inner walls had ten equally distant\nnotches (4 \u00d7 3 mm) milled into the upper surface. The roots\nwere kept in aerated nutrient solution that, for treated plants,\ncould be cooled via a heat exchanger linked to an external\nconstant temperature water bath. The plants were moved into\nthe outer chamber two nights before the experiment, and were\nkept at 500 - 550 \u00b5Em-2s-1. On the day of the experiment, prior\nto illumination, the petioles of fully-mature attached leaves\nwere sealed into the slots with Blu-Tak and the lids replaced.\nBoth control and treated plants were illuminated for\ntwenty minutes with CO2-free air being passed through the\nfeeding chambers for the last 10 minutes. 14CO2 was then\nadministered to 20 mature leaves from 10 plants (10 leaves in\neach chamber). Sodium [14C] bicarbonate (1.2 mL; 2.4 mci) was\ninjected into each feeding chamber onto excess lactic acid.\nThe feeding period was 30 min, after which the chamber was\nflushed with ambient air for 10 min. KOH (10% v\/v) was used\nto trap the unfixed 14CO2. During the subsequent chase period,\nambient air was passed through the chambers. Duplicate\nplants were harvested after 1h (immediately after feeding),\n6 h (after 6 h illumination), 12 h (after 12 h illumination), 18 h\n(12 h light, 6 h of the subsequent dark period) and 24 h (12 h\nlight, 12 h of the subsequent dark period). Extraction,\nfractionation and measurement of radioactivity was carried\nout as described previously (Kochhar et al. 2003). Soluble\nmaterial was fractionated by ion exchange chromatography\ninto an acidic fraction (organic acids plus acid-stable\nphosphorylated intermediates); a basic fraction (mainly amino\nacids) and a neutral fraction (carbohydrates). The neutral\nfraction was separated further by TLC, sugars were identified\nby co-chromatography with markers and radioactivity\nquantified by autoradiography\/densitometry (Kochhar et al.\n2003). Insoluble material was counted directly following\nsolubilisation and aliquots were also digested with\namyloglucosidase\/ \u00e1-amylase and the glucose released from\nstarch separated by TLC (Kochhar et al. 2003). During the\nchase period, respired 14CO2 was trapped by passage through\nKOH (10% v\/v) and aliquots counted by liquid scintillation\nspectrometry.\nEnzyme extraction and assay - SPS and invertase activities\nwere measured in extracts from the middle leaves of L. album\nharvested 0, 4, 8, 12, 18 and 24 h after the beginning of the\nphotoperiod commencing thirty-six h after sink manipulation\nRevista Brasil. Bot., V.26, n.4, p.533-540, out.-dez. 2003 535\nfor treated plants. The light period was 12 h. Concentrations\nof substrates as well as incubation time, temperature and pH,\nwere optimized to obtain V\nmax\n estimates. For the extraction of\nenzymes, leaf samples were harvested and ground in liquid\nN2. Weighed samples (200-300 mg) of the powdered leaves\nwere placed in a 2 mL screw-capped microtube and extracted\naccording to Huber et al. (1989). The extracts were desalted\nprior to assay.\nAssay of SPS - The activity of SPS was determined under\nV\nmax\n conditions by measuring fructose-6-phosphate-\ndependent formation of sucrose and sucrose-P from uridine\ndiphosphoglucose. Substrate concentrations were as\ndescribed in Huber et al. (1989) except that fructose-6-\nphosphate was at 5 mM.\nAssay of invertase - Invertase was assayed by measuring the\nrelease of glucose and fructose from sucrose under the\nconditions described by Lyne & ap Rees (1971) except that\nthe assay pH was 4.5. Released glucose and fructose were\ndetermined using a microtitre plate reader. In each well\n10-100 \u00b5L of the assay mix was added together with 200 \u00b5L of\nbuffer containing 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM\nNAD+, 10 mM ATP. The reaction was started by the addition\nof 5 \u00b5L of enzyme cocktail containing 1 U mL-1 of\nphosphoglucose isomerase, 1 U mL-1 of hexokinase and\n1 U mL-1 of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. The overall\nincrease in absorbance at 340 nm was measured for each well.\nResults\nPhotosynthetic parameters - These are summarized in\nfigure 1 for mature leaves in control and sink-\nmanipulated (treated) plants measured at various times\nduring the photoperiod three days after sink manipulation.\nSimilar results were obtained from other measurements\nmade over a seven-day period following sink\nmanipulation. In all cases, photosynthesis was reduced\nin treated plants, as was stomatal conductance. This\nwas accompanied by a reduction in transpirational water\nloss but no significant increase in intracellular CO2\ncontent. A\nmax \nvalues over the first three days following\nsink manipulation showed a significant and persistent\nreduction in treated plants (figure 2). These results\nsuggest that photosynthesis declined due both to\nstomatal regulation (Setter & Brun 1980) and to down-\nregulation of photosynthesis (Suwignyo et al. 1995).\nTotal radioactivity - The distribution of radioactivity in\nmiddle leaves of control and treated plants is shown in\nfigure 3. Immediately after the feeding period, the total\namount of radioactivity was lower in treated than in\ncontrol plants. This is probably due to the lower rate of\nphotosynthesis and decreased stomatal conductance\nobserved in treated plants (figure 1). During the dark\nperiod, total radioactivity increased in the middle leaves\nof treated plants. It is possible that, in the absence of\nother sinks, the younger leaves of treated plants acted\nas temporary sinks and that secondary transfer of\nradioactivity was responsible for this increase.\nAutoradiographs of 14CO2-fed plants (results not shown)\nindicated much greater retention of radioactivity in the\nleaves of treated plants throughout the 24 h chase period.\nImmediately after the feeding period, more radioactivity\nFigure 1.

The amount of 14CO2 released from both\ntypes of plant fell steadily during the chase period\n(figure 3).\nDistribution of radioactivity within mature leaves -\nTreated plants had more radioactivity in the soluble\nfraction than did control plants (figure 4A, B). In both\ncases, radioactivity decreased in the soluble fraction with\ntime and increased in the insoluble fraction until the end\nof the chase period. Generally, treated plants\naccumulated less radioactivity in the insoluble fraction\nand in starch than did control plants.\nDistribution of radioactivity within soluble components -\nThe middle leaves from treated plants had a greater\nproportion of the retained radioactivity in neutral\ncomponents throughout the chase period (figure 4C, D).\nIn the basic fraction, radioactivity in control leaves was\nalmost double than in treated leaves between 6 and 24 h.\nWe suggest that the high proportion of radioactivity in\nthe neutral components of extracts from mature leaves\nof treated plants was due to reduction in export\nassociated with sink manipulation. The pattern of\nchanges in radioactivity over time differed between\ncontrol and treated leaves. The highest percentage of\nradioactivity in the neutral fraction from control plants\nwas observed immediately after the feeding period. It\nwas then relatively stable till 18 h, whilst the opposite\nwas observed in treated plants. The subsequent decrease\nin neutral sugars in control plants could be due to\ntransport into sink tissues or repartitioning into the\nchloroplast as starch.\nFurther analysis of the neutral fractions from middle\nleaves of both control and treated plants indicated that\nsubstantial amounts of radioactivity were present in\nstachyose, raffinose and galactinol as well as in sucrose\n(figure 4E, F). In control plants, the radioactivity in\nsucrose fluctuated throughout the chase period, whereas\nit was more stable in treated plants. At 12 h (the end of\nthe light period) treated leaves had more radioactivity\nin stachyose than in any other neutral sugar, whereas\nthe opposite was true for control leaves. By contrast,\nthe partitioning of radioactivity into galactinol was greater\nin the control leaves.\nTime after treatment (days)\n45\n30\n15\n0\nDay-1 Day-2 Day-3\nA\nm\nax\n \n(\u00b5\n m\nole\n m\n-\n2  \ns -\n1)\nFigure 2.

Kochhar et al.: Source-sink balance in Lamium album538\nEnzyme activity - There was a small increase in\nextractable SPS activity during the day in extracts from\nleaves of both control and treated plants of L. album\n(figure 5A) despite the increase in sucrose content that\naccompanies photosynthesis in this species (Kochhar\net al. 2002). The increase was greater in extracts from\ncontrol plants. The apparent sucrose-insensitivity of SPS\nmay be a result of vacuolar sequestration of sucrose.\nThere was a marked decrease in SPS activity in both\ncontrol and treated plants by 18 h (6 h into the dark\nperiod) with a more marked decrease in activity in\nextracts from treated plants. Activities recovered to\ncontrol values by 24 h.\nA small but statistically significant increase in total\nsoluble acid invertase activity from extracts of both\ntreated and control leaves was observed during\nillumination (figure 5B). This increase was more marked\nin extracts from treated leaves, although this difference\ndeclined during the subsequent dark period.\nDiscussion\nPhotosynthesis and uptake of 14CO2 -  Restriction of\nsink activity was accompanied by a decline in both CO2\nuptake and A\nmax \n(figures 1, 2). In cucumber leaves,\ninhibition of photosynthesis was observed four days after\nremoval of aerial sinks (Mayoral et al. 1985) whereas\nin temperate gramineae net photosynthesis appears to\nremain substantially independent of sink activity for some\ntime after experimental manipulation (Natr 1969, Pollock\n& Housley 1985). Reductions in net photosynthesis can\nbe caused by stomatal closure (Setter & Brun 1980,\nand in this study stomatal conductance and\ntranspirational loss were reduced as a result of sink\nmanipulation. However, intercellular CO2 contents\nremained similar, suggesting that photosynthetic\nprocesses were also inhibited in treated leaves, and this\nis supported by the decline in A\nmax \n(figure 2).\nGoldschmidt & Huber (1992) observed declines in net\nphotosynthesis and A\nmax \nin a range of plants that store\nboth starch and sucrose, suggesting that the ability to\naccumulate RFOs does not lead to the insensitivity of\nphotosynthesis to assimilate abundance observed during\nfructan accumulation in temperate gramineae (Pollock\n& Housley 1985).\nPartitioning of fixed 14CO2 between mature leaves\nand the remainder of the plant was also altered markedly\nby sink manipulation (figure 3). In control leaves, decline\nin radioactivity following feeding was rapid, although\nthere was some apparent re-allocation of 14C back into\nthe fed leaves during the first part of the dark period. In\ntreated leaves, radioactivity was also lost during the light\nperiod but there was extensive re-allocation during the\ndark period, leading to a considerable excess of\nradioactivity in treated leaves after 24 h.\nAutoradiography of the plants (data not shown)\nconfirmed this excess of radioactivity within fed leaves\non treated plants. Reduction in sink activity frequently\nalters carbon partitioning. In sorghum leaves where\ntranslocation was blocked completely by steam girdling,\nan increase in radioactivity in starch was observed\n(Watson & Wardlaw 1981). In maize source leaves,\nincreasing sink demand led to an increase in the\nradioactive sucrose pool (Jeannette et al. 1995). Chilling\nsinks in vegetative plants of L. temulentum (Simpson\net al. 1991) also led to a significant accumulation of\nsoluble material in the source leaves. It appears that\nthe treatments imposed on L. album plants in this study\nproduced changes in photosynthesis and spatial\npartitioning that are similar to those observed for other\nspecies\nMetabolic partitioning of 14CO2 within mature source\nleaves - There were significant and progressive\ndifferences in the partitioning of 14C within the fed leaves\n(figure 4). In leaves from treated plants, partitioning of\ncarbon into insoluble material (including starch) was\nreduced, and there was little evidence of starch\nmobilisation during the dark period. This contrasted with\nthe greater accumulation of starch in control leaves\nduring the light period and its rapid turnover in darkness\n(figure 4A, B).\nWithin the soluble components, partitioning of 14C\ninto acidic and basic compounds was significantly\ninhibited in leaves from treated plants (figure 4C, D),\nand this was associated with increased accumulation of\n14C in raffinose, stachyose and verbascose. Stachyose\nwas the major soluble sugar in which 14C accumulated\nin leaves from treated plants, whereas in leaves from\ncontrol plants, radioactivity was more evenly distributed\n(figure 4E, F). In leaves from control plants, the\naccumulation of 14C in sucrose increased during the light\nperiod and fell again in darkness. By contrast, the 14C\ncontent of sucrose remained similar in leaves from\ntreated plants, with stachyose exhibiting a rise in the\nlight period, followed by a decline in the subsequent dark\nperiod. The reduced radioactivity in sucrose and\ngalactinol in leaves from treated plants suggested that\nthere was transfer of radioactivity from these sugars to\nRFOs. Galactinol is proposed to function as a galactosyl\ndonor in the biosynthesis of raffinose series\noligosaccharides (Senser & Kandler 1967, Kandler\n1967).\nRevista Brasil. Bot., V.26, n.4, p.533-540, out.-dez. 2003 539\nThese results, taken with the shift away from starch\naccumulation, indicate that RFO accumulation in\nL. album is sensitive to the balance between supply of\nand demand for fixed carbon, and to that extent functions\nas an analog to fructan accumulation in leaves of\ntemperate gramineae (Pollock et al. 1999). Significant\namounts of radioactivity also accumulated in RFOs when\nL. album plants were exposed to very high irradiance.\nUnder these experimental conditions no radioactivity was\npresent in starch (Kochhar et al. 2003).\nEnzymes of sucrose metabolism - Although the changes\nwere not large, mature leaves from treated plants\nshowed significant differences in the extractable activity\nof both SPS and soluble acid invertase (figure 5). Both\nof these enzymes are thought to play a key role in\nregulating sucrose content (Stitt 1996). SPS activity\nshowed a decline in the early part of the dark period,\nwhich was more marked in leaf extracts from treated\nplants. This decline has also been observed in other\nspecies (Pollock & Housley 1985). In this study, it is\nnot possible to ascribe regulatory significance to these\ndifferences, which may merely reflect differences in\nsubstrate or product abundance. We also did not\nmeasure the distribution of invertase between vacuole\nand apoplast or between photosynthetic and\nheterotrophic tissues. However, Suwignyo et al. (1995)\nobserved a direct correlation between the activity of\nSPS, sucrose content and carbon dioxide exchange rate\nin soybean leaves. In turn, vacuolar invertase activity\nhas been proposed to be involved in the regulation of\nthe amount of sucrose in leaves (Huber 1989). A similar\ndecrease in SPS activity and an increase in invertase\nactivity were observed in water-stressed mature maize\nleaves (Pelleschi et al. 1997). These workers suggested\nthat this was due to a combination of low rate of\nphotosynthesis, lower stomatal conductance and\naccumulation of sugars.\nIn L. album, carbon partitioning during sink limitation\nwas shifted away from starch and sucrose towards the\nsynthesis of RFOs. We suggest that this may be linked\nto a reduction in photosynthetic capacity. This was\nassociated with a reduction in the capacity to synthesise\nsucrose and an increase in saccharolytic activity.\nAcknowledgements \u2013 We are grateful to Professor John Farrar\n(University of Wales, Bangor) for his technical advice.
