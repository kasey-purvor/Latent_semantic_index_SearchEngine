Simultaneous observations with the IRIS, DASI\nand EISCAT systems are employed in the study of the spa-\ntial distribution and temporal evolution of auroral forms and\nprecipitation regions during substorm activity. The evolu-\ntion of the spectrum of precipitating electrons above Troms\u00f8\nduring the various phases of substorms is discussed. The\nflux-energy spectrum in the 1\u2013320 keV range is derived from\nEISCAT electron density profiles in the 70\u2013140 km altitude\nrange. At the late growth phase the precipitation flux at\nthe higher energies increases faster than at the lower ener-\ngies. The flux is always greater in the lower energy side\nof the spectrum and reaches a maximum a few minutes af-\nter substorm onset, then it decays while the spectrum nar-\nrows. The systematic analysis of 2-D structures correspond-\ning with well-defined optical and absorption features is also\ndiscussed. The orientation, characteristic lengths (elongation\nand width) and the gravity centre of these spatial features are\ndetermined. The statistical analysis of centre position and\nthe sizes of the corresponding signatures is presented. When\nsubstorm onset falls within the common field of view, there is\na close correspondence between the optical and the absorp-\ntion signatures of the auroral forms, as well as in their over-\nall north-south motion characteristic of the various phases\nof the substorm. Optical signatures of arcs are more evenly\ndistributed in space, being narrower and elongated along the\nL-shells, while the absorption regions appear more structured\nand patchy, although generally following the arcs\u2019 shape and\nalignment. Cross-correlation of the time series of maximum\nabsorption and maximum green-line emission is very high\nand seems to show a systematic delay of absorption relative\nto optical emission. Time delays are generally larger for dis-\nturbed conditions (40 to 60 s) than for moderately active con-\nditions (10 to 20 s).\nKey words.

We also ran the EISCAT radar system during the\nsame periods, pointing at a fixed position along the magnetic\nfield line at Troms\u00f8. The paper discusses three main topics\nconcerning the effects of substorm activity in the common\nfield of view of the various instruments: (1) the evolution of\nthe energy spectrum of the precipitating electrons at Troms\u00f8,\n(2) the correspondence of auroral forms and arcs as seen by\nthe IRIS and DASI systems and implications on the struc-\nture and extent of the corresponding ionisation distributions\nin the D- and E-regions, and (3) the statistics of the sizes and\nshapes of the absorption patches and the corresponding op-\ntical signatures (at 557.7 nm), as well as their distributions\nwith time.\nIRIS (Imaging Riometer for Ionospheric Studies), at\n69.05 N, 20.8 E, records the absorption of cosmic noise at\n38.2 MHz as measured by 49 beams (Browne et al., 1995).\nThe bulk of the absorption corresponds to ionisation by elec-\ntrons with energies in the 10 to a few 100 keV range and\ndeposition heights centred at \u223c 90 km. IRIS gives a pic-\nture of the horizontal extent of the ionisation with a time\nresolution of 1 s, and the motion of the ionisation region\ncan be calculated from its change in position in consecutive\ntimes. IRIS has a resolution of about 15\u25e6 corresponding to\nits 8\u00d7 8 pixels. DASI (Digital All Sky Imager, Kosch et al.,\n1998), at 69.35 N, 20.36 E, measures the 557.7 nm (green-\nline) auroral emission at a 10 s resolution. The zenith an-\ngle of the original all-sky images is converted to north-south\nhorizontal distance from vertical (at Skibotn, near Troms\u00f8),\nwith a spatial resolution of 10\u00d710 km, although the absolute\nresolution is 0.1\u25e6 in zenith angle. All-sky cameras record\nthe light emission from the excitation of neutral gases and\n1362 C. F. del Pozo et al.: Study of auroral forms and electron precipitation\nions by precipitating electrons with energies between 100 eV\nand a few keV. The bulk of the emission is from the altitude\nrange 100\u2013120 km. EISCAT (European Incoherent Scatter\nfacility at 933 MHz, Rishbeth and Williams, 1985) is a tri-\nstatic system with fully steerable antennas 32-m in diame-\nter at Troms\u00f8 (69.6 N, 19.2 E), Kiruna (67.9 N, 20.4 E) and\nSodankyla\u00a8 (67.4 N, 26.7 E). It measures the height profiles\nof various ionospheric parameters and the electric field. It\nalso allows for the estimation of the particle precipitation en-\nergy spectrum (del Pozo et al., 1997, 1999) and the height\nand width of the absorption layer above Troms\u00f8.\nEnergetic particles produce ionisation at low altitudes (D-\nand E-regions) and act as tracers of the magnetospheric pro-\ncesses responsible for the precipitation. The systematic anal-\nysis of these data arrays allows, for instance, the identifica-\ntion and follow-up of localised ionisation regions defined by\nclosed contours of either constant absorption or 557.7 nm in-\ntensity. The characteristic lengths (i.e. elongation and width)\nand symmetry axis of these spatial features are then deter-\nmined. Since most of the absorption recorded by IRIS is\nconcentrated in a relatively narrow altitude range, the 2-D\ndistributions give a relatively good representation of the sizes\nand shapes of the enhanced ionisation regions (Collis et al.,\n1996; Hargreaves et al., 1997). The necessary condition is\nthat the ionisation region is of at least the same cross sec-\ntion as the observing IRIS beams. Assuming the absorption\noccurs at 90 km, the IRIS beam at the zenith has a resolu-\ntion of \u223c20 km to the 3-dB points. Most of the beams will\nrecord at least 90% of the true absorption from a latitudinally\nconfined strip of absorption with a Gaussian cross section of\n\u2265 25 km across, which corresponds to a full-width of 60 km\nto the 3-dB points at 90 km altitude.\nThe absorption measured by the riometers is in fact a rela-\ntive value and it may be affected by contamination from man-\nmade interference, from scintillations, and by inaccurate cos-\nmic noise reference levels. Scintillations are large amplitude\nand relatively high frequency oscillations, due to discrete ra-\ndio sources in the sky, which, in our case, is basically due\nto the stars Cassiopeia, and to a lesser extent Cygnus, it af-\nfects a few and the same beam directions at different times.\nThey can be smoothed out, if not completely removed, by\nthe application of a sliding mean filter on the affected records\n(typically the window size at 10 s resolution is 5 min). Quiet-\nday curves are an indication of the noise-level IRIS would be\nexpected to measure on a day without any absorption, scin-\ntillation or interference. In our analysis they are generated\nfor a given period (usually 14 days at 1 s resolution) based\nupon the sidereal time. We take the median of a sample and\nits adjacent 598 neighbours, then we sort the data for each\ninstance and discard the largest value, as it may be corrupted\nby interference (e.g. lightning, solar radio emissions) or scin-\ntillation. We then take the mean of the next two largest val-\nues and repeat the procedure for each sidereal time and every\nbeam. Finally, the QDC is smoothed with a sliding mean fil-\nter with a window size of 599 s. The basis of the algorithm is\nto find the largest value received (excluding interference) for\nany time in the sidereal day.\nIn the case of the DASI images, on the other hand, there\nis an ambiguity in the extent of the optical signatures per-\npendicular to the L-shells. An additional problem is the ef-\nfect from clouds on the optical images, but this is avoided\nby the consideration of data from clear sky conditions alone.\nMost of the optical emissions come from the 100\u2013120 km al-\ntitude range (Egeland and Omholt, 1967), but weaker emis-\nsions from all heights may also be recorded by the all-sky\ncameras. Auroral forms associated with ionisation in this al-\ntitude range are in fact the bottom cross sections of luminous\ncurtains and the trace of the L-shells guiding the precipitat-\ning particles (Carlson and Egeland, 1995). The lower edge\nof these curtains is located at 100\u2013105 km and is defined by\nthe quenching of the green-line emission by strong collisions\nwith the neutral atmosphere. When an auroral curtain is not\nat the magnetic zenith of the camera location, both the bot-\ntom and the curtain surface are seen. In this case, the paral-\nlel rays from several hundred km appear to converge toward\nthe bottom edge, resulting in a fan-shaped display called the\ncorona. It is this corona effect which may produce a spurious\nbroadening of the arc-like features.\n2 Observations of substorm activity\nThe experiments consist of the simultaneous observation of\nsubstorm activity and auroral arcs employing IRIS, DASI\nand EISCAT systems. Interplanetary magnetic field data\nfrom WIND and ACE satellites were applied to identify the\nintervals of substorm activity associated with IMF Bz < 0\nand to estimate the time delay for the disturbances to reach\nEarth. Magnetic field data and pi2 pulsations at the ground\nwere provided by the IMAGE and SAMNET magnetometer\nchains. Pi2 pulsations occur simultaneously with substorm\nexpansion phase onset and subsequent intensifications (see,\nfor instance, Lester et al., 1983; Elphinstone et al., 1995;\nBradshaw and Lester, 1997; and references therein). The\nlatitudinal positions and times of the substorm onsets and\nintensifications can be determined using pi2 pulsations, the\ndecrease in the X component of the magnetic field, the ex-\nplosive growth of the 557.7 nm emission intensity (Voronkov\net al., 1999) and the hardening of the precipitation spectrum\nwhich produces a sharp increase in auroral absorption (Har-\ngreaves et al., 1975, 1997).\nWe have looked at several substorm events in both the\nevening and the post-midnight sectors during two periods of\nobservations on (a) 13\u201314 February 1996 and (b) 09 Novem-\nber 1998. Discrete auroral forms associated with these events\ncan be roughly classified as quiet arcs for period (a) and dis-\nturbed arc structures for period (b). A quiet arc is typically\ncharacterized as a longitudinally uniform, narrow band of\ngreen-line emissions associated with a uniform sheet of up-\nward field-aligned current (de la Beaujardiere et al., 1977).\nThe disturbed arcs consist of small-scale distortions or spirals\nwith a typical diameter of the order of 100 km and counter-\nclockwise rotational sense (Haerendel et al., 1996; Johnson\net al., 1998).\nC.

F. del Pozo et al.: Study of auroral forms and electron precipitation\n13\u201314 February 1996. The IMF Bz component was di-\nrected southwards from 16:00 to 17:15 UT and from 18:30 to\n20:00 UT on 13 February, and from 23:00 UT on 13 February\nto 01:30 UT on 14 February. The satellite was at \u223c 173RE\nfrom the Earth\u2019s centre and the average solar wind veloc-\nity at this position was \u223c 500 km\/s, which gives roughly a\ntime delay of \u223c 40 min for the disturbance to reach Earth.\nMagnetic activity was moderately disturbed with Kp values\nbetween 2+ and 4\u2212 and a day-average of 3\u2212 in 13 Febru-\nary 1996. The first substorm was associated with successive\nPi2 bursts at 17:34 UT, 17:46 UT, 18:12 UT, and 18:21 UT\non 13 February. A second substorm expansion started at\n19:49 UT, corresponding to a burst of pi2 activity. This ex-\npansion phase continued with repeated onsets marked by pi2\nbursts at 20:08, 20:23, 20:38, 20:54 and 21:03 UT, each new\nonset being accompanied by an intensification of the mag-\nnetic bay in at least some of the IMAGE stations. The bay\nobserved at Troms\u00f8 at 20:35 UT was the most intense and at\nthe same time the Z component switched abruptly between a\nminimum and a maximum value, suggesting the passage of a\nfilamentary westward electrojet disturbance right overhead.\nA third substorm, largely outside the common observing pe-\nriod of the various instruments, may have started at 23:48 UT\nwhen it was signalled by a very minor Pi2 burst, and then\nassociated with multiple onsets at 00:35 UT, 00:54 UT, and\n01:18 UT.\n09 November 1998. Strong substorm activity during this pe-\nriod corresponded to the end of a magnetic storm charac-\nterized by the negative IMF Bz component between 03:00\nand 23:00 UT. The satellite was at\u223c 208RE from the Earth\u2019s\ncentre and the average solar wind velocity at this position was\n\u223c 440 km\/s, which gives roughly a time delay of \u223c 50 min\nfor the disturbance to reach Earth. The Kp day-average\nfor 9 November 1998 is 6\u2212, with Kp values in the 15:00\u2013\n22:00 UT period between 4+ and 6+. Three partly overlap-\nping substorm events appear to be associated with distinc-\ntive bursts of pi2 activity in the SAMNET data at 17:00\u2013\n18:00 UT (1), 18:20\u201319:35 UT (2), and 20:20\u201321:25 UT (3).\nCorresponding major bays in the X-component of IMAGE\nmagnetic data are seen at 17:25 UT and 20:32 UT south of the\nIRIS field of view (near the latitude of Kiruna in both cases),\nand at 18:20 UT within the common field of view, slightly\nsouth of Troms\u00f8. Other minor magnetic bays are also seen at\n17:00 UT, at 19:00 UT, and at 20:10 \u02d9UT and 21:25 UT.\nFigure 1 shows the composite plots for observation peri-\nods (a) 13\u201314 February 1996 at 17:00\u201301:00 UT, and (b) 09\nNovember 1998 at 17:00\u201322:01 UT. It displays together the\nkeograms at 19.25\u25e6 lon. from IRIS absorption (top panel)\nand from the DASI 557.7 nm emission (second from top) for\nthe respective fields of view of the instruments. The maxi-\nmum values and the corresponding latitudes for the absorp-\ntion and the luminosity, normalised to the absorption, in the\ncommon field of view, are shown in the third and fourth pan-\nels, respectively. The colour scales for the absorption (in dB)\nand light emission in log (rayleighs) are shown on the foot of\nthe figure.\nThe maximum light intensity at the longitude of Troms\u00f8\nwas 7 kR in period (a), and 32 kR in period (b). A major\ndifference between these two periods is that whereas the 9\nNovember 1998 was a highly disturbed period, stronger au-\nroral activity took place mostly outside the IRIS field of view.\nDuring 13 February 1996, substorm activity was most of the\ntime within the IRIS field of view. We can see, for instance,\nthat outside the few intervals when the strong substorm ac-\ntivity reached further south, the absorption values are consis-\ntently lower in period (b) than in period (a). Notice the trace\nof scintillations on the absorption in period (b), around 69\u25e6\nlatitude, during interval 17:40\u201319:20 UT. Scintillation effects\nare not completely removed by the filtering algorithm, but its\nrelative importance is significant only when the background\nabsorption is very low (below 0.2\u20130.3 dB in this case).\nThe vertical lines on the third panel from the top on period\n(a) mark the times of the multiple expansion phases from the\npi2 pulsations: 17:34 UT, 17:46 UT, 18:12 UT, and 18:21 UT,\nfor substorm (1); 19:49 UT, 20:08 UT, 20:23 UT, 20:38 UT,\n20:54 UT, and 21:03 UT, for substorm (2); and 00:35 UT,\n00:54 UT and 01:18 UT for substorm (3). Maxima in lumi-\nnosity and absorption spikes generally correspond with the\npi2 bursts when the substorm westward current disturbance\nis seen within the common field of view. For period (b) we\nare just marking the intervals of substorm activity at 17:00\u2013\n18:00 UT, 18:20\u201319:35 UT, and 20:18\u201321:25 UT. The simul-\ntaneous peak in the absorption and the optical emission on\nthe third panel of Fig. 1b corresponds to the bay in the X-\ncomponent of the magnetic field at 20:32 UT and to a burst\nof pi2 activity.\nThe DASI keogram covers the camera field of view out to\n\u00b175\u25e6 zenith angle. It is clear from the figure that there is a\ncorrespondence between the optical activity recorded by the\nall-sky camera and the lower E-region ionisation measured\nby the riometer. We can see the explosive increase in lumi-\nnosity at the times when the multiple substorm onsets took\nplace. The keograms are projected to the 100 km common\nheight to facilitate the comparisons. The magnetic field lines\nare nearly in the meridian plane at 12.5\u25e6 S from the verti-\ncal, and the characteristic height for the absorption features\nis 90 km and 110 km for the optical features.\nThe third panel from the top shows the systematic cor-\nrespondence between maximum optical emission and maxi-\nmum absorption when substorm activity is present within the\ncommon field of view, particularly during the 13\u201314 Febru-\nary 1996 period. The bottom panel shows that the signatures\nof the same auroral feature, as seen by the two systems in\nthe common field of view, lie close to each other with maxi-\nmum absorption often slightly south of the maximum optical\nemission. At times when this is not the case, the stronger\nsubstorm disturbance was either to the north or to the south,\noutside the IRIS field of view, which explains the concentra-\ntion of points at 70.2\u25e6 or 67.8\u25e6 lat.\nThe bottom panel, and especially in period (a), also shows\nsome characteristic features of the evolution of the arcs dur-\ning substorm events (Rostoker et al., 1980): north to south\nmotion during growth phase until substorm onset (at intervals\n17:34\u201318:12 UT, 18:12\u201318:21 UT, 20:38\u201320:54 UT, 20:54\u2013\nC.

Positive lags\nmean that the absorption maximum pre-\ncedes the green-line maximum.\n21:03 UT) when the luminosity of the most equatorward arc\nincreases sharply, and the auroral bulge expands north. When\nthis northward motion stops, recovery phase is signalled by\narcs moving south again (after 18:21 UT and 21:03 UT). Due\nto the multiple onsets, the growth phase of a new substorm\nappears to overlap the recovery phase of the previous sub-\nstorm. The characteristic pattern of precipitation during sub-\nstorm activity in the late evening and early morning sectors is\nalso seen by EISCAT: discrete enhancements in electron den-\nsity and penetration to lower heights at substorm onsets, and\nthen the strong, slowly varying enhancement at the morning\nhours. This corresponds with similar signatures in the single\nbroad-beam riometer records (Ranta et al., 1983; Hargreaves\nand Devlin, 1990; Burns et al., 1990).\nOnly during moderately disturbed conditions (13\u201314\nFebruary 1996), we can see the presence of well-defined arc\nstructures in the optical records, changing relatively slowly\nwith time, and in very good correspondence with associated\nabsorption features. Optical emission and absorption struc-\ntures are closely collocated with each other and follow the\ngeneral alignment with the magnetic L-shells, and drifting\nwith similar velocities and directions. During relatively high\nto strongly disturbed conditions (as in 9 November 1998),\nthere is still a general correspondence between optical and\nabsorption signatures, but we can not see any well-defined\narc structures. Both the optical and absorption signatures\nare much more structured, complex, and changing rapidly.\nStoker et al. (1996) have compared all-sky images of optical\nemissions and the imaging riometer in Antarctica and found\nthat during substorm onset, before local magnetic midnight,\nabsorption regions showed marked inhomogeneous distribu-\ntions and were adjacent to, but do not coincide with, spatially\nwell-defined regions of optical emissions.\nCross-correlation of the time series of maximum absorp-\ntion and maximum green-line intensity in the common field\nof view seems to show a systematic delay of the absorp-\ntion relative to the optical emission. Figure 2 displays the\ncross-correlation coefficient between absorption maximum\nand the square root of green-line intensity maximum at the\nlongitude of Troms\u00f8, for three intervals of substorm activity\nduring (upper panel) 13\u201314 February 1996 (17:00\u201319:30 UT,\n20:00\u201322:00 UT, and 23:30\u201301:00 UT), and (lower panel)\n09 November 1998 (17:00\u201318:00 UT, 18:20\u201319:40 UT, and\n20:00\u201321:30 UT). The unit lag in all cases is 10 s, the lowest\ncommon time resolution for IRIS and DASI. Positive lags\nmean that the maximum in the 557.7 emission precedes the\nabsorption maximum and may indicate that softer electrons\nprecipitate first, closer to their Alfve\u00b4n layer, while harder pre-\ncipitation has been dispersed closer to Earth.\nThe high correlation between these time series means that\nboth instruments basically record the same time variations\non the same population of precipitating electrons, but in two\ndifferent energy ranges. This is also the case at other longi-\ntudes within the full extent of the precipitation region. This\nfact has been utilized, for instance, in the estimation of the\ncharacteristic energies in the paper by Kosch et al. (2001).\nThe time delays are larger for highly disturbed conditions, of\nthe order of 40 s to 60 s in period (b) compared to the moder-\nately active period (a) that indicates a time delay of the order\nof 10 s to 20 s. Results for interval 20:00\u201321:30 UT in period\n(b) are less clear; however, the correlation coefficient is max-\nimum close to the zero lag but the curve is nearly flat up to\nlag 6 or so. Stoker et al. (1996) have found a time delay of\n52 s shortly after a Sudden Storm Commencement in 9 June\n1366 C.

This period is of particular interest because we\ncan clearly identify slowly varying arc structures in both the\noptical and absorption records, during three multiple-onset\nsubstorms seen within the common field of view of the in-\nstruments, and in one event, the westward electrojet distur-\nbance is seen almost over Troms\u00f8 (at 20:35 UT). For a case\nstudy of the electrodynamics of arcs during this period, see\ndel Pozo et al. (2001a). When substorm onset is seen within\nthe IRIS field of view, there is a close correspondence be-\ntween the optical and absorption signatures of auroral forms,\nas well as in the overall north-south motion characteristic of\nthe various phases of the substorm. Maximum absorption\nand green-line emission are nearly co-located with absorp-\ntion slightly offset south of the maximum green-line emis-\nsion.\nFigure 3 shows a well-defined arc feature from simultane-\nous observations by the IRIS and DASI systems in the com-\nmon field of view of IRIS at 17:58 UT on 13 February 1996.\nThe various symbols and corresponding line segments show\nthe length and elongation axis of the closed contours in both\nabsorption and 557.7 nm intensity. The spatial distribution\nof the harder precipitation responsible for the enhanced ab-\nsorption appears more structured than the narrower arc fea-\nture seen by DASI. Overall, there is a close correspondence\nbetween the two observations: the middle panels show the\nlength and orientation of the features defined by the closed\nC.

The L-shells\nare given by the 1996 International Reference Geomagnetic\nField Model.\n3.1 Energy spectrum of electron precipitation at Troms\u00f8\nPlasma sheet electrons in the keV energy range are injected\ndeeper into the magnetosphere during the substorm, primar-\nily because of the strong convection electric field, and then\nexperience strong pitch-angle scattering and radial diffusion\n(Wolf, 1995). In most of our determinations, from elec-\ntron densities measured by EISCAT at Troms\u00f8, the elec-\ntron precipitation spectrum is roughly represented by a sin-\ngle Maxwellian distribution, suggestive of an electron pop-\nulation which has been accelerated long before precipitation\ntakes place (Kosch et al., 2001). The acceleration processes\nin the plasma sheet may also produce further stretching and\nwidening of the tail of the Maxwellian distribution. This is a\nfeature typical of electrons originating at the central plasma\nsheet (cps), whereas acceleration along the field lines taking\nplace after precipitation would be signalled by a secondary\npeak in the spectrum associated with a drifting Maxwellian\n(characteristic of electrons from the boundary plasma sheet,\n\u201cbps\u201d, Rostoker et al., 1985). For instance, Kirkwood and\nEliasson (1990) have reported that the electron spectrum a\nfew minutes after substorm onset have sharper peaks than the\nMaxwellian form (in the 5\u201310 keV range) that may be due to\nparallel acceleration processes, and that both pre-onset and\npost-onset diffuse precipitation seem to be due to \u201ccps\u201d elec-\ntrons with a closely quasi-thermal spectrum with high-energy\ntail.\nThe electron precipitation features in the evening and\nmorning sectors are basically symmetric, the only difference\nseems to be associated with the energies to which electrons\nare accelerated within the boundary plasma sheet in the two\nsectors, as discussed by Rostoker et al. (1985). They found\nthat electron energies of 5\u201310 keV are not at all uncommon in\nthe late evening sector, whereas in the early morning hours\nit is rare to find particles accelerated to energies in excess\nof 1\u20132 keV. This is consistent with our observations where\nmaximum flux in the flux-energy spectrum is also in the 5\u2013\n10 keV range in the evening sector (before \u223c 20:00 UT), and\nin the 1\u20132 keV range in the post-midnight hours. Figure 4a\n(upper panels), for instance, shows the electron precipita-\ntion spectrum around substorm onsets at 18:12 UT (dashed\nline), at 18:21 UT (dashed line), and at 20:38 UT, in intervals\n18:10\u201318:16 UT, 18:19\u201318:25 UT, and 20:38\u201320:44 UT. The\nspectra are plotted on a log-log scale to better recognise their\nshapes at the lower energies. The time step is 2 min in all\ncases.

Two cases of complex auroral forms observed on 9 November 1998, the colour scale for the absorption is in dB. (a) Arc-like structures\nat 17:16 UT, the smaller field of view of IRIS only records the absorption patch associated with, and slightly south of, the middle optical arc.\nThe scale for the optical emission is linear in kR. (b) Spiral shaped auroral form or distortion on the auroral arc at 20:54 UT, the absorption\nregion in the IRIS field of view is located slightly south of the lower \u201carm\u201d of the optical feature. The logarithmic scale for the optical\nemission is just to obtain a better contrast. The full and dashed lines show, respectively, the elongation and alignment of the absorption\nregion and the optical feature.\n3.2 Correspondence of auroral forms and absorption\n\u201cpatches\u201d\nBoth the optical and absorption signatures result from elec-\ntron precipitation and are associated with the region of up-\nward field-aligned current in the auroral arc system. The\nedge of the precipitation region faces the region of strong\nelectric field and weak conductivity associated with the\ndownward current, which is equatorward of the arc system\nin the eastward electrojet (evening sector) and poleward in\nthe westward electrojet (morning sector). Optical signatures\nare more evenly distributed in space and clearly elongated\nalong the L-shells, while the absorption regions appear more\nlocalised and patchy, although generally following the shape\nof the optical signatures. This structure does not seem to be\nexplained by the coarse resolution of the absorption images\nor, as we discuss later, by the effects of contamination at the\nriometer operating frequency. DASI, with its finer resolution\nand larger field of view, shows the presence of large-scale,\narc-like structures, of a scale-size greater than the IRIS reso-\nlution.\nHigher energy electrons are the result of radial diffusion\nand acceleration processes in the plasma sheet, and this may\nexplain the equatorward spreading and complexity of the ab-\nsorption regions. This can also explain the shift of the maxi-\nmum absorption south of the maximum optical emission. Be-\nlow we present the characteristic patterns of the arc-like au-\nroral forms and the correspondent absorption regions in the\neastward and westward electrojets. In Fig. 5, for instance, we\nshow four auroral forms as seen by IRIS and DASI in their re-\nspective fields of view during 13 February 1996. The bottom\npanels give a closer view of the contour plots corresponding\nwith the top 2-D images. The full line is an estimate of the\nextent and alignment of the absorption region by connecting\nthe centres of the absorption patches as defined by the closed\ncontours. The dashed line gives the elongation axis of the\nclosed iso-intensity contour of maximum length within the\nDASI field of view.\nFigure 5a shows an evening sector arc (at\n17:44 UT\/20:14 MLT) during substorm late growth phase,\nand the dot-dashed line defines the sharper edge of the\nabsorption\/higher energy precipitation region which is on\nthe poleward side of the optical signature. There is a clear\ncorrespondence between the absorption and the green-line\nintensity distributions. The absorption region, however,\nis more structured and spreads equatorward of the optical\narc-like feature which is not very narrow itself. The auroral\ncurtain associated with this arc-like signature, lies north of\nthe magnetic zenith at the camera location, and we may\nbe seeing the corona effect to the north. The sharp and\nmost intense bottom edge of the optical emission is very\nclose to the dashed line connecting the centres of maximum\nabsorption, and slightly equatorward of the sharp absorption\nboundary (dot-dashed line). Both the full line and the\ndot-dashed line are closely aligned together and with the\npoleward side iso-contours of the optical feature rather than\n1370 C. F. del Pozo et al.: Study of auroral forms and electron precipitation\nwith the sharper equatorward edge of the optical arc, which\nis rotated to the south and west. This is a common feature of\nthe evening arc structures during the whole period.\nFigure 5b is similar to Fig. 5a but now it shows a post-\nHarang discontinuity, midnight arc, at 20:42 UT\/23:12 MLT,\nduring substorm expansion phase. EISCAT observations and\nIMAGE magnetic data show the reversal of the plasma drift\ndirection after 20:00 UT. This optical arc is much narrower\nthan the evening feature and shows the alignment and possi-\nble overlapping between the optical arc and the sharper pole-\nward edge of the absorption region. We can clearly see that\nmost of the absorption region lies equatorward of the opti-\ncal arc. The optical arc appears to be \u201ccompressed\u201d between\nthe region of strong electric field on its poleward edge (in the\nwestward electrojet) and the sharp bottom edge of the op-\ntical emission to the south. Figure 5c shows an arc during\nearly morning precipitation at 22:08 UT\/00:38 MLT within\nsubstorm recovery phase. Contrary to the observations in\nthe evening and near midnight sectors, however, the main\nabsorption region appears to lie north of the optical emis-\nsion region. This time we may be seeing two populations of\nprecipitating electrons, particularly in the absorption record:\none associated with the main absorption signature poleward\nof the optical arc and the other south of it, in the bottom left\ncorner of the absorption image, and mostly outside of the\nIRIS field of view equatorward of the arc. After 23:00 UT\n(01:30 MLT), we see well-defined and relatively narrow arcs\nin the DASI records with the corresponding absorption re-\ngion equatorward of it. Figure 5d, for instance, shows such\nan arc at 23:30 UT (02:00 MLT), the sharper edge of the op-\ntical signature lies on the poleward side of the arc system.\nThe absorption patch poleward of the optical arc may be\nassociated with \u201cbps\u201d precipitation from the morning shear\nzone, while the absorption region, equatorward of the op-\ntical arc, could be associated with electrons which entered\nthe \u201ccps\u201d during substorm in the evening to midnight sector\nand drifted eastward under the combined effects of the gra-\ndient and curvature drifts and the convective E \u00d7 B drift.\nDrift paths of the electrons in the distant tail plasma sheet\nare primarily earthward as a consequence of the dawn-to-\ndusk convection electric field. Close to the Earth, gradient\nand curvature drift effects lead to asymmetries in the drift\npatterns. Some electrons accelerated in the dusk sector ve-\nlocity shear zone will drift into the dawn hemisphere. Thus,\nthe cps electron population in the morning sector will con-\nsist of two components, one having originated in the evening\nshear zone, and one having originated in the morning shear\nzone (Rostoker et al., 1985).\nAlthough auroral forms during the highly disturbed pe-\nriod of 9 November 1998 are much more complex, the gen-\neral correspondence with the absorption patches is consistent\nwith the observations on 13 February 1996. Figure 6 dis-\nplays two cases of these complex auroral forms observed on\n9 November 1998. Case (a) shows what appears to be three\narc-like structures at 17:16 UT, the smaller field of view of\nIRIS only records the absorption patch associated with, and\nslightly south of, the middle optical arc. Case (b), on the\nother hand, shows a spiral shaped auroral form or a distor-\ntion on the auroral arc at 20:54 UT, the absorption region in\nthe IRIS field of view seems to occupy the regions slightly\nsouth of the lower \u201carm\u201d of the optical emission pattern. In\norder to obtain a better contrast in the optical image, we plot,\nin this case, the logarithm of the green-line intensity. The\ndashed and full lines superimposed on the plots are, respec-\ntively, the axis of the closed contour of maximum elongation\nfor the DASI images, and the estimated extent and general\norientation of the absorption regions.\nThe region of very low absorption in Fig. 6a is a product of\nthe incomplete removal of the scintillation effects mentioned\nbefore (the traces are seen in Fig. 1b, at about the same lat-\nitude and longitude). Scintillation effects are very localised\nand, after application of the removal algorithm, absorption\n\u201clows\u201d may appear on regions of very low background ab-\nsorption at the edges of, or completely outside, regions of\nenhanced absorption. We have looked at the individual im-\nages from the two periods, particularly on 9 November 1998,\nand we found no evidence that these \u201clows\u201d may produce\nsignificant distortions or \u201cfalse structure\u201d in the absorption\nimages.\n3.3 Size of the absorption and green-line intensity struc-\ntures\nImage analysis techniques were applied to both IRIS and\nDASI 2-D distributions, in order to identify and compare\nthe spatial structure and to study the temporal evolution of\ncorresponding auroral forms and precipitation regions. The\naxis of maximum elongation or major axis, and the equiva-\nlent length and width of the 557.7 nm emission and the ab-\nsorption \u201cpatches\u201d were systematically determined, as well\nas their areas and gravity centres. These patches are defined\nby the outermost closed contours around regions of enhanced\nabsorption or optical emission. They may correspond with\ndistinct features on the IRIS or the DASI images at any given\ntime, and be associated with structure in the ionisation in-\nduced by the electron precipitation. The number and size of\nthe closed contours are, of course, functions of the field of\nview and resolution of the instruments, and the step sizes for\nthe contours. Indeed, events taking place at the edge of the\nfields of view may have no closed contours at all. The min-\nimum levels employed in this study to define the absorption,\nand the optical features are, respectively, 0.2 dB and 1 kR,\nand we are fixing the number of contours to ten levels in all\ncases.\nWe only consider events occurring within the field of view\nof the instruments and, thus, the maximum size of the closed\ncontours will be limited by the size of the effective ob-\nserving windows which are nearly 250 km and 500 km, for\nthe IRIS and DASI systems, respectively. Separated fea-\ntures inside these fields of view will have different outer\ncontour values and different peak intensities and, therefore,\nmeaningful comparisons and statistics have to consider fea-\ntures with similar ratio, r , of the outer intensity level to the\npeak intensity. In this way, the estimated dimensions will\nC.

Angle between the geographic east-west direction and the main axis of the closed contours of maximum length at any given time for\nboth IRIS (x) and DASI (o). Angles for period 13\u201314 February 1996 are shown in the first and second panels from the top, and in the third\nand four panels for 9 November 1998. The main axes are in most cases within \u00b1 50\u25e6 from the east-west direction.\nAs we can see in Fig. 7 small-scale structure is dominant for\nboth instruments and the two periods. Actually, small-scale\nstructure is roughly associated with values r > 0.6, while\nvalues r < 0.6 are mostly associated primarily with large-\nscale structure.\nComparing the two different periods in Figs. 7, we can see\nthat the distributions of lengths and widths for, respectively,\nIRIS and DASI have similar shapes, particularly for the IRIS\nobservations. The higher number of cases in period (a) can\nbe explained by the longer observing time, 8 h, as compared\nwith 5 h in period (b). The average values (weighted aver-\nages) of the distributions of length and width are very similar\nfor the two periods and instruments, with values of 95 km\nand 52 km for IRIS, and of 175 km and 70 km for DASI, in\nperiod (a); and with values of 92 km and 51 km for IRIS,\nand of 162 km and 62 km for DASI, in period (b). Maximum\nwidths for IRIS and DASI are also comparable in each period\nand around 170 km on 13 February 1996 and around 110 km\non 9 November 1998. The maximum length of the absorp-\ntion features (between 200 and 260 km) in both periods and\nthe maximum length of the optical features on 13 February\n1996 (around 500 km) are limited by the fields of view in the\ntwo systems. Maximum widths, on the other hand, are in all\ncases smaller than the size of the fields of view. This is also\ntrue for the maximum length in the DASI determinations on\n9 November 1998, which is around 300 km and may reflect\nthe fact that disturbed arcs consist of smaller scale distortions\n(quiet arcs, as on 13\u201314 February 1996, are generally longi-\ntudinally uniform, large-scale features).\nLooking at Fig. 8, only a very small part of the total num-\nber of closed contours are associated with the half-intensity\npatches and, contrary to Fig. 7, Fig. 8 shows a larger relative\nnumber of cases for the disturbed period ((b), 9 November\n1998) than for the quieter period ((a), 13\u201314 February 1996).\nThe average length and width in Fig. 8 are, however, quite\ndifferent for IRIS and DASI, and for the two periods. They\nare equal to 204 km and 132 km for IRIS, and to 340 km and\n137 km for DASI, in period (a); and equal to 125 km and\n73 km for IRIS, and to 180 km and 65 km for DASI in pe-\nriod (b). We are, therefore, observing shorter and thinner\nabsorption and optical emission features during higher mag-\nnetic activity conditions.\nComparison with previous results in the literature is dif-\nficult due to the very limited number, to our knowledge,\nC.

Hargreaves et\nal. (1997), for instance, found that high intensity nightside\n\u201cspike\u201d events associated with substorm activity are usually\nelliptical in shape, with the major axis generally along the\nL-shells. They estimated the median dimensions of 190 km\nand 80 km for the length and width of the half-absorption\nclosed contours. Moreover, Ranta et al. (1997) have reported\nthe presence of small-scale features in the afternoon sector,\nshortly after the substorm onset, with sizes from 30 km by\n30 km to 180 km by 130 km. Concerning the optical emis-\nsion, on the other hand, as mentioned before, quiet-time au-\nroral arcs are aligned approximately along the L-shells and\nextend for a few 100 km to 1000 km east-west. The disturbed\narcs consist of small-scale distortions or spirals with a typi-\ncal diameter of the order of 100 km. Johnson et al. (1998)\nhave reported a latitudinal extent between 30 km and 150 km\nfor a sample of 100 arcs, mainly in the evening to midnight\nsectors; the sizes are mostly between 40 km and 60 km, and\nthe average thickness is 55 km.\nFigure 9 shows the angle between the elongation axis and\nthe geographic east-west direction for the closed contours of\nmaximum length at any given time for both IRIS and DASI.\nWe can see that the direction of the elongation axis is in\nmost cases within angles smaller than 50\u25e6 from the east-west\ndirection. Angles for the period 13\u201314 February 1996 are\nshown in the first and second panels from the top and in the\nthird and four panels for 9 November 1998. DASI results\nshow that in both periods the major axes are generally closer\nto the east-west direction, as expected from the previous ob-\nservations of the L-shell alignment of the large-scale arc-like\nstructures. The larger dispersion in the IRIS results indicates\nthat we are observing smaller scale structure with arbitrary\nmajor axis alignment.\nFinally, Fig. 10 displays the latitudes of the gravity centre\n(circles), of the middle point on the major axis (triangles),\nand of the point of maximum intensity (dots) for the closed\ncontours of maximum length at any given time, from both\nIRIS and DASI in their respective fields of view. The first and\nthe second panels from the top are for the 13\u201314 February\n1996 period; the third and the fourth are for the 9 November\n1998 period. The generally close coincidence between the\n1374 C. F. del Pozo et al.: Study of auroral forms and electron precipitation\ncentre of the major axes, the gravity centres, and the points of\nmaximum intensity of the closed contours, in both IRIS and\nDASI images, indicates that the auroral forms and absorption\npatches must be nearly elliptical in shape, elongated along\nthe major axis.\n4 Conclusion\nSimultaneous IRIS and DASI observations were employed\nin a study of the spatial distribution of electron precipita-\ntion and of their temporal evolution during substorm activ-\nity. The simultaneous operation of EISCAT provides high-\nresolution measurements of a number of physical parame-\nters defining the state of the ionosphere above Troms\u00f8 and\nallows for the estimation of the particle precipitation spec-\ntrum. Only during quiet-to-moderately disturbed conditions\n(on 13\u201314 February 1996, period (a)), can we see the pres-\nence of longitudinally uniform arc structures in the optical\nrecords, changing relatively slowly with time, and the very\ngood correspondence with simultaneously measured 2-D ab-\nsorption features. The optical emission and absorption struc-\ntures are closely co-located and follow the general alignment\nwith the magnetic L-shells, drifting with similar velocities\nand directions. The maximum absorption is generally south\nof the maximum 557.7 nm emission by as much as 0.5\u25e6 lati-\ntude. During strongly disturbed conditions (on 9 November\n1998, period (b)), on the other hand, there is still a general\ncorrespondence between optical and absorption signatures,\nthe location and motion of their maxima, but we do not see\nany well-defined arc structures. Both optical and absorption\nsignatures are much more complex and changing rapidly.\nCross-correlation of the time series of maximum absorp-\ntion and maximum green-line intensity in the common field\nof view appears to show a systematic delay of the absorption\nrelative to the optical emission. The time delays are larger\nfor highly disturbed conditions, of the order of 40 to 60 s in\nperiod (b), compared to the moderately active period (a) that\nindicates a time delay of the order of 10 to 20 s. Results for\ninterval 20:00\u201321:30 UT in period (b) are less clear, however,\nthe correlation coefficient is maximum close to zero lag but\nthe curve is nearly flat up to lag 6 or so. The high correlation\nbetween these time series means that both instruments basi-\ncally record the same time variations on the same population\nof precipitating electrons, but in two different energy ranges.\nIn all cases, high energy electrons responsible for the ab-\nsorption appear to come from deeper in the inner magneto-\nsphere, being accelerated and dispersed before precipitation.\nLower energy electrons associated with the auroral forms and\narcs appear to precipitate close to their mirror points and\ntheir optical signature is distributed in a relatively narrow\nregion close to the L-shells. The corresponding absorption\nsignature extents equatorward of the optical arc. The sharper\nedge of the optical feature faces the region of strong electric\nfield and weak conductivity associated with the downward\nfield-aligned current in the arc system. This sharp boundary\nlies equatorward for auroral forms in the eastward electro-\njet (evening sector) and poleward for those in the westward\nelectrojet (morning sector).\nHigher energy electrons must be the result of radial diffu-\nsion and acceleration processes in the plasma sheet, which\nmay explain the equatorward spreading and complexity of\nthe absorption regions. This can also explain the shift in the\nmaximum absorption south of the maximum optical emis-\nsion. In early morning, moreover, we may be seeing two\nseparated absorption regions associated with two different\npopulations of higher energy precipitation, (1) poleward of\nthe optical arc that may be associated with cps precipitation\nstreaming from the morning sector \u201cbps\u201d plasma, and (2) the\nabsorption region, equatorward of the optical arc, associated\nwith electrons which entered the \u201ccps\u201d during substorm in\nthe evening to midnight sector and drifted eastward under\nthe combined effects of the gradient and curvature drifts and\nthe convective E \u00d7 B drift.\nThe major axis orientation, and the equivalent length and\nwidth of optical emission and absorption \u201cpatches\u201d were sys-\ntematically determined. These patches are defined by the\noutermost closed contours around regions of enhanced ab-\nsorption or optical emission. Different features will have dif-\nferent outer contour values and different peak intensities and,\ntherefore, meaningful comparisons and statistics have to con-\nsider features with similar ratio, r , of the outer intensity level\nto its peak intensity. In this way, the estimated dimensions\nare independent of the peak intensities. For instance, ratios\n0.4 < r < 0.6 will define the half-intensity patches enclosed\nby contours with intensity levels around 50% of their peak\nintensities. Histograms for all the r values show that small-\nscale structure is dominant for both instruments and two pe-\nriods. Actually, smaller size features are roughly associated\nwith values of r > 0.6, while larger sizes are mostly asso-\nciate with values of r < 0.6. The average length and width\nare very similar for the two periods and instruments, with val-\nues of 95 km and 52 km for IRIS, and of 175 km and 70 km\nfor DASI, in period (a); and with values of 92 km and 51 km\nfor IRIS, and of 162 km and 62 km for DASI, in period (b).\nOnly a very small part of the total number of closed con-\ntours are associated with the half-intensity patches. Their\naverage length and width are equal to 204 km and 132 km for\nIRIS and equal to 340 km and 137 km for DASI, in period\n(a); and equal to 125 km and 73 km for IRIS, and 180 km and\n65 km for DASI in period (b). We are, therefore, observing\nshorter and thinner absorption and optical emission features\nduring higher magnetic activity conditions.\nFinally, the close coincidence between the centre of the\nmajor axes, the gravity centres, and the points of maximum\nintensity of the closed contours, in both IRIS and DASI im-\nages, seems to indicate that most of the time the shapes of\nthe auroral forms and absorption patches are nearly ellipti-\ncal. The major axis is generally at angles smaller than 50\u25e6\nfrom the east-west direction.\nAcknowledgements.
