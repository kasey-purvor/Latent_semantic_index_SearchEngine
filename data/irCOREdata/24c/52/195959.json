Kauppi et al. 2 \nAbstract \nTraditional methods for surveying meiotic recombination in humans are limited to \npedigree and linkage disequilibrium analyses. We have developed assays that allow the direct \ndetection of crossover and gene conversion molecules in batches of sperm DNA. To date, we \nhave characterized 26 recombination hotspots by allele-specific PCR and selectively amplified \nrecombinant DNA molecules from these regions. These analyses have revealed that meiotic \ncrossover hotspots in humans are highly localized and flanked by DNA segments where \nrecombination is suppressed. The centers of crossover hotspots are also active in non-crossover \nrecombination, displaying short conversion tracts. \n \nKey Words: allele-specific PCR, haplotype, sperm DNA, crossover, gene conversion \n \n1. Introduction \nHuman DNA diversity arises from germline mutation, creating new haplotypes that are \nthen reshuffled by meiotic recombination. It has become increasingly obvious that meiotic \nrecombination events in mammals are not randomly distributed, but instead cluster into highly \nlocalized regions (recombination hotspots). \nSeveral experimental approaches have been used to characterize the frequency and spatial \ndistribution of meiotic recombination events in humans. Examining parent-to-offspring \ntransmission of alleles at several loci (the so-called pedigree approach) has identified localized \ngenomic regions, at the 1\u201310 kb scale, in which recombination events appear to cluster (for \nexample, refs. 1-5). However, because of the small size of human families, the number of \n20. Kauppi et al. 3 \ninformative meioses is limited. This approach to measuring meiotic recombination rates thus is \nnot suitable for detecting low frequency events or for defining hotspots with precision. \nAn alternative method for elucidating the genome-wide distribution of recombination \nevents is to examine patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD). LD reflects recombination in all of \nthe generations since the rise of the individual polymorphic alleles under study. Various LD \nmeasures exist for characterizing the statistical association between alleles at different loci (see, \ne.g., refs. 6, 7 for reviews). High-resolution LD analyses of the human genome show extended \ndomains of markers in strong association interrupted by areas of LD breakdown (8, 9). \nIn principle, if strong LD is found between two loci, little if any historical recombination \nhas occurred between the loci. Conversely, little or no LD (that is, breakdown of LD) implies \nhistorical recombination activity. Regions of LD breakdown are therefore putative recombination \nhotspots, and can be directly tested for crossover and gene conversion activity, as we describe in \nthis chapter. However, patterns of LD can be influenced also by the age of crossover events, \nselection acting on single or linked alleles, and demographic history (10, 11), highlighting the \nimportance of experimentally verifying recombination activity in a region of interest. \nIn this chapter, we describe strategies to identify and characterize human recombination \nhotspots. First, high-resolution LD structure is examined to identify signatures of historical \ncrossing-over (Fig. 1A). LD profiles can sometimes be complex, so genotype data can also be \nanalyzed by linkage disequilibrium unit mapping to provide a simple summary profile of the rate \nof LD breakdown across the genotyped region, facilitating the detection of putative hotspots \n(12). More sophisticated coalescent methods are also available that allow detailed estimation of \nthe historical recombination profile across the region most compatible with contemporary \nhaplotype diversity (13-16). The next step is to test LD block boundaries (putative hotspots) for \n20. Kauppi et al. 4 \nmeiotic recombination hotspot activity using allele-specific PCR to recover crossover molecules \ndirectly from sperm DNA (Fig. 1B). Crossover breakpoint mapping and the resolution of \nhotspots is limited only by the density of heterozygous markers within the target region; \nresolution to less than 0.5 kb is usually possible by choosing individuals with appropriate \ngenotypes. Once the precise location of a crossover hotspot is known, assays can be designed to \nanalyze non-crossover recombination events (gene conversions) at the center of the hotspot. \nSperm typing experiments have demonstrated that areas of LD breakdown frequently \ncorrespond with generally good precision to meiotic crossover hotspots (15, 17-21). All hotspots \ndefined share similar widths (1-2 kb wide) but vary considerably in intensity with sperm \nrecombination frequencies varying from 0.0004% to 1% over currently characterized hotspots. \nCrossover hotspots often occur in clusters and together account for at least 80% (13, 16, 22), and \nprobably more than 95% (15, 23), of all crossovers in the male germline. \nTo facilitate the analysis of non-crossover gene conversions at hotspots, a DNA \nenrichment-based assay has been developed that can capture conversion events involving even \nsingle SNP sites (24). Assays performed at three human crossover hotspots showed that \nconversions are even more localized, although they peak in activity at the centre of the crossover \nhotspot (25). This is consistent with crossovers and conversions being produced by the same \ninitiation events, presumably DNA double-strand breaks. Conversion tracts are very short (<300 \nbp on average), and initiation events seem to cluster within a zone of just ~400 bp. However, \ndata from five loci indicate that the relative frequencies of conversion to crossover show major \nvariation between hotspots, ranging from ~10:1 to <1:12 (25-27). \nThe methods described in this chapter have provided significant insight into the nature of \nhuman meiotic recombination. The obvious drawback of sperm PCR techniques is that they can \n20. Kauppi et al. 5 \nonly be used to analyze meiotic recombination in human males. Pedigree data remain essential \nfor analyzing the distribution and rate of female recombination events, though population genetic \ninferences of historical recombination in females can be gained by LD analysis of the sex-\nspecific region of the X chromosome. \n \n2.

Commercially available siliconized tubes appear to be less reliable and can \ncause reduced yields due to adsorption of single stranded DNA. \n14. Two waterbaths, one set at temperature to anneal biotinylated ASO to target and other at \ntemperature to elute the bound DNA \n15.  If Alu competitor is required, 10 \u00b5M working stocks of primers Alu-F (5' \nGGTGGCTCACGCCTGTAATC 3') and Alu-R (5' AGACGGAGTCTCGCTCTGTG 3') \n \n3. Methods \n3.1. DNA extractions \nAll DNA extractions should be carried out in a laminar flow hood under conditions that \nminimize risk of contamination (28). Waste material must be discarded into disinfectant (e.g. \nsolution made with Titan Chlor-Tabs 500, Lever Industrial, Runcorn, Cheshire UK) to destroy \nany pathogens. \n \n3.1.1. Extracting DNA from semen \n1. Semen donors should be requested to wash the penis prior to ejaculation to minimize the \nrisk of contamination with cellular material from their partner. Ejaculates should be \n20. Kauppi et al. 10 \ncollected in 5 mL 1x SSC and stored at -80\u00b0C. Samples so stored are suitable for sperm \nDNA preparation for at least 10 years. \n2. Thaw sample and transfer 1 mL semen\/SSC to a screw-top microfuge tube. For a typical \nejaculate, this amount should yield ~30 \u00b5g sperm DNA. If larger amounts of DNA are \nrequired, then process multiple aliquots of semen in parallel. Centrifuge at 13,000 rpm \n(15,700g) in a microcentrifuge for 2 min, discard the supernatant and re-suspend the cell \npellet in 1 mL 1x SSC with vigorous shaking until a uniform cell suspension is obtained. \nAdd 20 \u00b5L 10% SDS (0.2% final concentration) to lyse any non-sperm cells. Mix \ncontents by inverting vigorously and centrifuge at 13000 rpm (15700 rcf) in a \nmicrocentrifuge for 2 min. Discard the supernatant and re-suspend the pellet in 1 mL 1x \nSSC, 0.2% SDS. Centrifuge as before. \n3. Discard the supernatant and re-suspend the pellet in 450 \u00b5L 0.2x SSC. Lyse sperm heads \nby the addition of 50 \u00b5L 10% SDS (1% final concentration), 35 \u00b5L 2-mercaptoethanol (1 \nM final concentration) and Proteinase K to a final concentration of 200 \u00b5g\/mL. Mix by \ngently inverting the tube. \n4. Incubate the sample for 30 min to 1 h in a waterbath at 37\u00b0C with occasional gentle \nmixing. Lysis should be evident within 5 min as the lysate becomes viscous. Spin in \nmicrocentrifuge at 13000 rpm (15700 rcf) for 1 min. \n5. Remove any residual proteins by adding 350 \u00b5L phenol, followed by gentle mixing by \ntube inversion to allow emulsification, and spin in a microcentrifuge at 13000 rpm \n(15700 rcf) for 2 min. Transfer the top aqueous layer into a clean microcentrifuge tube. \nUse a plastic pipette tip with the end cut off to provide a larger bore for pipetting the \nviscous DNA solution. Be careful not to pipette too close to the inter-phase layer. \n20. Kauppi et al. 11 \n6. Re-extract residual DNA from the organic layer by adding 200 \u00b5L 1x SSC and 20 \u00b5L of \n10% SDS to the tube. Mix well by inversion, then centrifuge. Remove the aqueous layer \nand pool it with the aqueous solution collected from the first phenol step (step 5). Discard \norganic layer. \n7. Subject the pooled aqueous solution to a second round of phenol extraction (i.e. repeat \nsteps 5-6).  \n8. Divide the pooled aqueous layers (0.9 mL) into three 0.3-mL aliquots in microcentrifuge \ntubes and precipitate the DNA at room temperature by adding 2 vol (0.6 mL) of absolute \nethanol to each tube (see Note 1). Tap and invert the tube until DNA precipitates as a \nsingle, compact, stringy, white lump. Pellet DNA by centrifugation at 13000 rpm (15700 \nrcf) for 10 sec. Remove supernatant and add 800 \u00b5L 80% ethanol to wash the pellet. \nCentrifuge and remove supernatant. \n9. Dissolve each DNA pellet in 60 \u00b5L ddH2O per tube by occasional gentle pipetting. The \nDNA should fully dissolve within 5 min. Pool the DNA solutions from the three tubes \nand re-precipitate by adding 20 \u00b5L 2 M sodium acetate (pH 7.0) and 400 \u00b5L absolute \nethanol. Invert the tube until DNA precipitates, and spin in a microcentrifuge at 13000 \nrpm (15700 rcf) for 10 s. Discard supernatant and wash pellet with 600 \u00b5L 80% ethanol. \nPellet DNA by spinning in a microcentrifuge at 13000 rpm (15700 rcf) for 10 s. Remove \nthe supernatant. Spin again at 13000 rpm (15700 rcf) in microcentrifuge for 10 s and \ndiscard any remaining supernatant. Vacuum-dry pellet and dissolve in 50 \u00b5L 5 mM Tris-\nHCl (pH 7.5). \n \n3.1.2. Extracting DNA from blood \n20. Kauppi et al. 12 \n1. Collect venous blood into an equal volume of 1x SSC and store at \u221280\u00b0C. Thaw and \nremove 1 mL of blood\/SSC to use for the DNA extraction. Freezing\/thawing lyses almost \nall erythrocytes. \n2. Spin the blood\/SSC at 13000 rpm (15700 rcf) in a microcentrifuge for 1 min. This step \npellets white blood cells, erythrocyte ghosts and any remaining erythrocytes. Remove \nsupernatant and wash the pellet twice with 800 \u00b5L 1x SSC, with centrifugation, to remove \nall hemoglobin. \n3. Re-suspend the cell pellet in 450 \u00b5L 0.2x SSC by vigorously shaking by hand to produce a \nhomogeneous cell suspension. Lyse the cells by adding 50 \u00b5L 10% SDS (1% final \nconcentration), 35 \u00b5L 2-mercaptoethanol (1 M final concentration) and Proteinase K to a \nfinal concentration of 200 \u00b5g\/mL. Mix by gently inverting the tube. Lysis will be \nimmediately apparent. \n4. Continue with the DNA preparation as described above (steps 4-9 in Subheading 3.1.1). \n \n3.1.3. Quantification of genomic DNA \n1. To quantify the DNA, add 0.6, 0.9 and 1.2 \u00b5L aliquots of the DNA solution to 1 mL \nddH2O and measure absorbances at 260 nm using a spectrophotometer. Add appropriate \nvolume of 5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) to make a working stock DNA concentration, \ntypically of 100 to 400 \u00b5g\/mL. Store DNA at -80oC. \n2. Run serial dilutions of genomic DNA of a known concentration (for example, 100 ng, 50 \nng, 25 ng and 12 ng per lane) alongside your sample on a 0.8% agarose gel in 0.5x TBE \n(with 0.2 \u00b5g\/ml ethidium bromide in both the gel and the buffer) to verify DNA \nconcentration and to check DNA quality. \n20. Kauppi et al. 13 \n \n3.2. Allele-specific PCR to detect crossover molecules \nTo minimize contamination, keep reagents and materials used for PCR separate from \ngeneral laboratory chemicals, and set up PCRs in a laminar flow hood. \n \n3.2.1. Designing allele-specific PCR primers \nCrossover assays use nested allele-specific PCR primers and thus require pairs of 5' and \n3' selector sites (Fig. 1). These sites can be up to 13 kb apart, the maximum distance that can be \nefficiently amplified at the single DNA molecule level using our current long PCR protocol. \nIt is difficult to predict the behavior of an allele-specific primer. When designing them, \naim for at least 50% GC content, if possible. Examples of allele-specific primers that we have \nused successfully (23) are shown in Table 2. The most common length is 18 nucleotides, but \nvery GC-rich allele-specific primers can be as short as 14 nucleotides. Allele-specificity is \nachieved by virtue of the last 3' base. The genomic context of the SNP for which the primer is \nspecific mainly dictates the GC content. However, various 5' extensions can be added to boost \nthe GC content of relatively AT-rich primers and improve primer efficiency, for example C4-5 or \nif necessary a synthetic 19-20 nucleotide sequence which itself can be used as a driver primer \nduring allele-specific PCR (see primers B7RT\/Ad and B7RG\/Ad in Table 2 for an example). \n \n3.2.2. Optimizing allele-specific PCR primers \n1. To ensure efficient and specific amplification when using allele-specific primers for \ncrossover analysis, PCR conditions must be tested empirically using long PCR (29). Set \nup PCRs in 0.2 mL tubes on a MJ Research PTC-225 Tetrad DNA Engine or other \n20. Kauppi et al. 14 \nsuitable thermal cycler, in a total volume of 10 \u00b5L with 0.9 \u00b5L of 11.1x PCR buffer \nsupplemented with 12 mM Tris base, 0.2 \u00b5M allele-specific primer, 0.2 \u00b5M universal \nprimer (to give an amplicon 1-6 kb long), 0.03 U\/\u00b5L Taq polymerase and 0.003 U\/\u00b5L Pfu \npolymerase per reaction (see Note 2). \n2. To determine the optimal annealing temperature of each allele-specific primer, amplify \n20 ng of genomic DNA or equivalent whole-genome amplified DNA (30) at various \nannealing temperatures (typically 56, 59, 62 and 65\u00b0C). As template, use DNA from one \nindividual homozygous for the SNP allele at the 3' end of the allele-specific primer, and \nfrom another individual homozygous for the alternative allele in parallel reactions. If you \nare optimizing PCR conditions for a forward allele-specific primer, use it in combination \nwith a universal reverse primer (22 to 24 nucleotides long) that produces a slightly \nshorter fragment than the amplicon you are planning to amplify in the crossover assay. If \nyou are optimizing PCR conditions for a reverse allele-specific primer, use it in \ncombination with a universal forward primer. As a positive control, replace the allele-\nspecific primer with a universal primer located near the allele-specific primer site. We \nroutinely denature the template in an initial step of 96\u00b0C for 1 min, followed by 34 cycles \nof (denaturing at 96\u00b0C for 20 s, 30 s at annealing temperature and extension at 65\u00b0C for \napproximately 90 s\/kb, see Note 3). \n3. To each 10 \u00b5L PCR, add 2 \u00b5L all-purpose loading dye and run 6 \u00b5L on a 0.8% agarose \ngel in 0.5x TBE (with both the gel and the buffer containing 0.5 \u00b5g\/mL ethidium \nbromide), with 200 ng of size standard alongside your samples. Photograph the gel, \nincluding very long exposures to visualize any very faint PCR products (see Note 4). \n \n20. Kauppi et al. 15 \n3.2.3. Determining linkage phase of donors to be used in crossover assays \n1. From your collection of semen donors, identify individuals who are heterozygous for \nselector SNP sites (F1, F2, R1, R2 in Fig. 2) and who also carry internal heterozygosities \nsuitable for mapping crossover breakpoints in recombinant molecules. \n2. If selector SNP sites F1\/F2 and R1\/R2 are separated by a putative recombination hotspot, \nthen they will most likely be in free association and their linkage phases will therefore be \nunknown. Determine linkage phase, i.e. haplotypes, for these SNP sites by allele-specific \nPCR using allele-specific primer pairs F1-R2, F2-R1 and F2-R2 in all four possible \ncombinations of each allelic primer (see Fig. 2). If, as is likely, F1 and F2 lie outside a \nhotspot and are in strong association, then their linkage phase can be inferred from \ngenotype data; the same will probably be true for R1 and R2. Under these circumstances, \nonly one phasing assay needs be done, e.g. F2-R2, to determine complete 4-marker \nhaplotypes. Under no circumstances should phasing be done using the outside primers \nF1-R1, as this will generate PCR products that could easily contaminate primary PCRs in \nsubsequent crossover analyses. \n3. Retain the positive PCR products from the phasing assay and store at \u201320\u00b0C. These \nseparated haplotypes will be needed later for haplotyping internal SNPs during crossover \nbreakpoint mapping (see Section 3.3.1). \n \n3.2.4. Amplification of crossover molecules from sperm DNA \nSperm crossover analysis is feasible once suitable pairs of allele-specific primers for \nprimary PCR and for nested secondary PCR have been developed. Modification of primers (see \n20. Kauppi et al. 16 \nSection 3.2.1) may prove necessary to develop primer pairs that operate with good efficiency \nand specificity at the same annealing temperature. \nOne further problem is recombination frequency. Human crossover hotspots vary widely \nin sperm crossover frequency, from 0.0004% to 1% at currently characterized hotspots, and the \ncrossover frequency over the test interval will not be known a priori. An initial pilot crossover \nassay over widely varying inputs of sperm DNA is therefore necessary. Given that a haploid \nhuman genome contains 3 pg DNA, then 6 pg sperm DNA will contain on average one molecule \nof each haplotype. Not all DNA molecules will amplify during PCR due to primer inefficiency \nand DNA damage; our experience indicates that typically 50% of molecules will generate PCR \nproducts. Thus 12 pg genomic DNA will contain one amplifiable molecule of each haplotype, \nand a PCR seeded with 1000 molecules should contain an input of 12 ng DNA. \nCrossover assays can also generate spurious positive PCRs, usually because of \nincomplete specificity of an allele-specific primer leading to bleed-through of one or other \nprogenitor haplotype in the assay. Jumping PCR artifacts arising from annealing between \nprogenitor haplotypes can also occur, though these are generally rare (see also Section 3.2.4.2). \nBoth can be controlled in the pilot assay by including blood DNA from the semen donor. We \nhave never seen an authentic crossover in blood DNA, which therefore provides an ideal \nnegative control. \nIt is also advisable to include positive controls in the pilot assay by spiking some PCRs \nwith genomic DNA from an individual carrying haplotypes showing the opposite linkage phase \nbetween 5' and 3' selector sites; such individuals should have been identified in the linkage \nphasing assay (see Section 3.2.3). Obviously, such genomic DNA should be handled with \n20. Kauppi et al. 17 \nextreme caution during PCR setup, given its ability to cause major contamination of the assay \nwith \u201ccrossover\u201d molecules. \n \n3.2.4.1. First round of PCR \nTo detect crossover molecules, amplify multiple aliquots of sperm DNA using the outside \nprimer pair F1-R1 in recombinant phase (Fig. 2). A typical 96-well plate setup would contain six \nrows of sperm DNA with 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600 and 3200 molecules per well (1.2\u201338.4 ng \nDNA per PCR), plus two rows of blood DNA (one row at 800 and one at 3200 molecules per \nwell). Positive controls are obtained by spiking a few wells with 0.5 \u00b5L 200 ng\/mL genomic \nDNA (8 amplifiable molecules) from a control individual (see Section 3.2.4). This setup will \nscreen 76,000 molecules for crossovers and will detect crossover molecules even at \nrecombination frequencies as low as 0.0013%. \n1. Set up PCRs as in Subheading 3.2.2, step 1, but in total volumes of 8 \u00b5L. Start PCRs \nwith an initial denaturation step at 96\u00b0C for 1 min, followed by cycling conditions \ndetermined in the optimization experiments. Generally, 26 cycles of amplification should \nbe used in the primary PCR. \n2. Immediately dilute PCR products with 35 \u00b5L 5 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 plus 2 \u00b5g\/mL high \nmolecular weight herring or salmon DNA carrier, or if necessary proceed to S1 nuclease \ndigestion (see Section 3.2.4.2 and Note 5). \n \n3.2.4.2. S1 nuclease digestion (optional, see Note 5) \n20. Kauppi et al. 18 \n1. Set up the same number of fresh 0.2 mL PCR tubes as you have in the first round of PCR, \nor a fresh plate. To each fresh tube, or each well in the fresh plate, add 5 \u00b5L S1 digestion \nmix containing 0.7 U\/\u00b5L S1 nuclease.  \n2. Take 0.5 \u00b5L of each primary PCR product and add to S1 digestion mix. Mix by pipetting \nup and down three times.  \n3. Leave samples to digest at room temperature for 20 min. \n4. Add 45 \u00b5L of S1 dilution buffer to each digest to bring the pH above 7. Keep on ice. \nStore S1 digests at -20\u00b0C. They are stable for at least 6 months. \n \n3.2.4.3. Second round of PCR \n1. Set up each of the secondary (nested) PCRs in a 10 \u00b5L total volume. Seed each PCR with \n0.5 \u00b5L of diluted primary PCR product or 1.6 \u00b5L of S1-digested primary PCR product. \nUse allele-specific primers targeted towards inner SNP selector sites in recombinant \nphase. As in section 3.2.4.1., start all PCRs with an initial denaturation step at 96\u00b0C for 1 \nminute, followed by optimized cycling conditions. Amplify the secondary PCRs for 30-\n35 cycles. \n2. Add 2 \u00b5L all-purpose loading dye to each tube, and run out 5 \u00b5L aliquots on an agarose \ngel in the presence of 0.5 \u00b5g\/mL ethidium bromide in both the gel and the buffer. A \nsuccessful assay will show as positive secondary PCRs increasing in frequency with \nincreasing sperm DNA input, a lack of PCR products in blood DNA reactions, and \nstrongly positive signals in the positive control PCRs. \n \n3.2.4.4. Calculating crossover frequencies \n20. Kauppi et al. 19 \nEstimate the crossover frequency from the numbers of positive and negative PCR \nreactions at each input of sperm DNA. To illustrate the different steps of crossover scoring, the \nhypothetical crossover assay shown in Fig. 3 (8 input pools of 2000, 600 and 200 molecules \neach, with 7, 3 and 1 crossover positive reactions recovered, respectively) is used as an example \nthroughout sections below. \n1. Estimate the frequency of crossovers (m) in input DNA for each input pool by Poisson \napproximation: \nm= -ln (number of negative reactions\/total number of reactions). \n2. Maximum-likelihood methods (software written by A.J.J., available upon request) can be \nused to estimate crossover frequency more accurately by combining data from all input \npool sizes. The mean crossover frequency calculated for the example data set in Fig. 3 is \n0.89x10-3, with lower and upper 95% confidence intervals of 0.41x10-3 and 1.72x10-3. \n \n3.2.4.5. Bulk recovery of crossover molecules \n1.  Use the crossover frequency estimates from Subheading 3.2.4.4 to estimate optimal \nDNA pool sizes for efficient recovery of crossover molecules. Accurate definition of \ncrossover profiles in the test interval requires the recovery and mapping of about 100 \ncrossovers.  \n2. Recover crossovers from a single 96-well plate by using varying inputs of sperm DNA \ncontaining from 0.6 to 1.5 crossover molecules per well. Set up PCRs such that at the \nlowest inputs 45% of PCR reactions will be positive (and consequently 74% of positive \nreactions will be derived from a single input crossover molecule). The corresponding \nfigures at the highest inputs are 88% and 43%, indicating that the majority of positive \n20. Kauppi et al. 20 \nPCRs will contain DNA from more than one crossover, though not all molecules will \nnecessarily show different exchange points. Mixed products derived from two or more \ncrossovers with different exchange points can be readily identified during crossover \nbreakpoint mapping (see Section 3.3.4). \n \n3.2.4.6. Reciprocal crossover assays \nThe crossover assay shown in Fig. 1 recovers black-to-white crossover molecules. \nReciprocal crossover products can be recovered by changing all allele-specific primers to their \nalternative allele, to recover white-to-black crossovers. The assay must take into account the \ndifferent annealing specificities of the alternative primers. Assays performed in each orientation \nare independent of each other and provide a useful test of reciprocity; equal crossover \nfrequencies should be seen in both assay orientations. Also, reciprocal crossover data provide a \npowerful probe for detecting differences in recombination initiation frequencies on the two \nhaplotypes in an individual (31). \n \n3.3. Mapping locations of crossovers \n3.3.1. Third round of PCR \n1. Re-amplify secondary PCRs using universal PCR primers located just internal to the \nsecondary PCR primer SNP sites. Set up PCRs in total volumes of 10\u201320 \u00b5L, seeded with \n0.5 \u00b5L of secondary PCR product. Reserve two wells on the PCR plate and seed with one \nor other separated progenitor haplotype prepared in Subheading 3.2.3, step 3. Amplify \nfor 35 cycles to ensure that all reactions now amplify, even those seeded with blood DNA \nand crossover negative sperm reactions. \n20. Kauppi et al. 21 \n2. Add 2.5\u20135 \u00b5L all-purpose loading dye, and check that PCR amplification has occurred to \na uniform high level by electrophoresis of 0.6 \u00b5L of PCR product\/loading dye mix on an \nagarose gel. Only a few reactions need be tested. \n \n3.3.2 Transferring reactions onto dotblots (see Note 6) \n1. Cut two pieces of 3MM paper, plus as many pieces of nylon membrane as you need \nreplica filters, to the size of your 96-well dotblot manifold (we use model DHM-96, Scie-\nPLAS, Southam, UK). Soak paper and membranes in ddH2O for a few minutes. \n2. Place the two pieces of 3MM paper on the dotblot manifold. Overlay with one piece of \nnylon membrane. Assemble the dotblot manifold, making sure that the securing nuts are \nuniformly fastened but not over-tightened. Apply a vacuum to the assembled manifold. \n3. Add 30 \u00b5L of denaturing solution (0.5 M NaOH, 2 M NaCl, 25 mM EDTA) per replica \nfilter (e.g. 180 \u00b5L denaturing mix if you wish to make 6 replica filters) directly to PCRs \nfrom Subheading 3.3.1 and mix well by pipetting up and down, or by sealing the plate, \nmixing and centrifuging. \n4. Using a multichannel pipette, load 35 \u00b5L denatured DNA into each well of the manifold. \nOnce all samples are loaded and the liquid has been pulled through the membrane, add \n150 \u00b5L 2x SSC to each well to neutralize DNA. Bake dotblots for 10 min at +80\u02daC and \ncovalently link the DNA to the membrane by UV exposure in a UV crosslinker. \n \n3.3.3. ASO hybridization \n1. Label each ASO by mixing 1 \u00b5L 10x kinase mix, 0.2 \u00b5L [\u03b3-32P]-ATP, 7.8 \u00b5L ddH2O, and \n0.35 \u00b5L T4 polynucleotide kinase (10 U\/\u00b5L) in a screw-top microcentrifuge tube at room \n20. Kauppi et al. 22 \ntemperature (see Note 7). Add 1 \u00b5L of 8 \u00b5g\/mL ASO. Incubate at 37\u00b0C in a heat block \nfor 1-3 h. Add 20 \u00b5L kinase stop solution. The probe can be used immediately for \nhybridization, or stored at +4\u00b0C or -20\u00b0C for a few days. \n2. Soak dotblots in 3x SSC. Transfer each to a small hybridization bottle with the DNA side \nfacing inwards. \n3. Pre-hybridize dotblots at 49\u02daC for 5 minutes in 2 mL TMAC hybridization solution. \nDiscard solution. Add 2.5 mL fresh hybridization solution. Incubate in rotator oven at \n49\u02daC for 5 min. \n4. Add 32P -labelled ASO and 40 \u00b5L unlabelled 8 \u00b5g\/mL ASO of the opposite allele as \ncompetitor. Hybridize in rotator oven at 49\u02daC for 1-2 h. \n5. Wash membranes inside bottles in two changes of 2-3 mL TMAC wash solution at 53\u02daC \nin rotator oven for approximately 5 min per wash, followed by one 15 min wash with 4 \nmL TMAC wash solution. \n6. Rinse membranes twice in ~5-10 mL of 3x SSC in the bottles at room temperature, then \ntransfer the membranes to a Pyrex tray with 3x SSC and wash at room temperature a few \ntimes. \n7. Blot excess liquid off membranes with 3MM paper, seal them in Saran wrap and \nautoradiograph at room temperature or at -80\u00b0C with an intensifier screen. Do not allow \nthe blot to dry out (see Note 8). \n8. Combine all membranes in a Pyrex dish and remove the probe with at least 10 changes of \n100 mL boiling 0.1% SDS. Monitor probe removal using a Geiger-Muller meter; >99% \nof label should be removed. Re-probe the same membrane with the ASO corresponding \n20. Kauppi et al. 23 \nto the alternative allele of same SNP site. Dotblots can be re-probed at least 10 times \nwithout loss of signal. \n \n3.3.4. Mapping crossover breakpoints \nASO typing reveals the status of each internal SNP site in each crossover-positive PCR. \nThe presence of progenitor haplotypes on the same dotblot allows internal alleles to be assigned \nto one or other progenitor haplotype, essential for the determination of crossover breakpoints. \nIncluding crossover negative and blood PCRs can provide useful information on bleed-through \nPCR amplification of progenitor haplotypes and help identify potentially problematic allele-\nspecific primers used in crossover recovery. Hypothetical examples of dotblot data are shown in \nFig. 4. \nCrossover-positive reactions can either be \"simple\" (see e.g. dot number 11 in Fig. 4B-\nC), or \"mixed\", i.e. giving a positive signal upon hybridization with both alleles of some SNP \nsites (see e.g. dot number 1 in Fig. 4B-C). \"Simple\" ones contain only one class of crossover; \nthey might contain more than one crossover molecule, but all crossovers have their breakpoint in \nthe same inter-SNP interval. \"Mixed\" reactions contain two or more different crossovers. We \nscore them as two crossovers, one with a breakpoint 5' to where a succession of one or more \nmixed SNP sites starts, and the other 3' to where the mixture finishes (Table 3B). The estimate \nof the number of crossovers will always be conservative - simple reactions may contain more \nthan one crossover, but only one will be scored; mixed reactions may contain more than two \ncrossovers, but only two will be scored. The true number of crossovers will therefore be higher, \nand can be estimated for each inter-marker interval by Poisson correction. This involves \ncombining data (number of PCRs positive and negative for a given type of crossover) over all \n20. Kauppi et al. 24 \ninput pool sizes. Note that some PCRs will not be scorable for certain types of crossover; \nspecifically, if a PCR contains a succession of two or more mixed sites, then each interval \nbetween mixed sites will not be scorable for a crossover in that interval, since such crossovers \nwill be masked by the two definite exchanges that create the succession of mixed sites. Such \nPCRs should be ignored in the Poisson correction. \nCrossovers may occasionally be observed in the end intervals (furthest 5' or 3' SNP \ninterval assayed by ASO hybridization, see dot 7 in Fig. 4C). Crossovers of this type could either \nhave their breakpoint in the interval between the inner selector site and the nearest internal \nheterozygous SNP site, or they could be PCR artifacts arising from bleed-through amplification \nof one or other haplotype. Analysis of crossover-negative PCRs and of blood DNA can show \nwhether such bleed-through amplification is a reasonable explanation. If not, then score these \nend-interval crossovers but interpret with caution. If bleed-through is a significant problem, then \nignore the end interval when determining the crossover profile over the test interval. \n \n1. Score ASO signals on dotblots. Order crossovers in a table according to the location of \ntheir breakpoints, 5' to 3'. Count the number of crossovers for each SNP interval (Table \n3C). Maximum-likelihood methods (software written by A.J. Jeffreys, available upon \nrequest) can then be used to estimate the mean frequency of crossovers in each interval, \ntaking into account in which input pools the crossovers were observed (Table 4A). \n2. Adjust the number of molecules screened for each SNP interval where mixtures are \nobserved by excluding pools that contain sequential mixed sites spanning the SNP \ninterval (see intervals SNP4-SNP5 and SNP5-SNP6 in Table 4A). For each SNP interval, \nmultiply the maximum-likelihood Poisson estimate of recombination frequency by the \n20. Kauppi et al. 25 \ntotal number of molecules screened, to yield the Poisson-corrected number of crossovers \nadjusted for any missing data from PCRs showing sequential mixed sites (Table 4B). \nCalculate the recombination activity in cM\/Mb for each SNP interval as follows: \n(Poisson-corrected number of crossovers\/total number of molecules screened) x 100 = \nrecombination fraction in cM, \nthen: \n(recombination fraction in cM\/length of interval in bp) x 106 = recombination activity per \nunit physical length in cM\/Mb. \nRecombination activity across the example interval in Fig. 4A is shown in Fig. 4D and \nTable 4B. \n \n3.4. Detecting gene conversions and crossovers using the half-crossover assay \nRecombination can generate both crossovers and non-exchange gene conversions. The latter \noften involves the transfer of just a single SNP marker between haplotypes and cannot be detected \nin crossover assays. An alternative approach that is capable of detecting such events is the half-\ncrossover assay (Fig. 5) in which nested allele-specific PCR on sperm DNA is directed to markers \nonly at one end of the test interval, with universal primers being used at the other end. In the \nabsence of recombination, PCR products will only be generated from the selected haplotype. \nRecombinants can be detected by the presence of markers from the unselected haplotype, with \ncrossovers and conversions each giving distinct patterns of positive markers. PCR amplifications \nare essentially as described in Sections 3.2.4.1 and 3.2.4.3, with recombinant detection as \ndescribed in Sections 3.3.2 and 3.3.3 (see Note 9). \n \n20. Kauppi et al. 26 \n1. For primary PCR, set up a long PCR master mix (800 \u00b5L) containing the outermost allele-\nspecific primer, the distal universal primer plus typically 48 ng sperm DNA. Array 8 \u00b5L \naliquots into a 96-well plate to give 0.48 ng sperm DNA per PCR (40 amplifiable \nmolecules of each haplotype for this input). Amplify for 26 cycles using annealing \ntemperature conditions optimal for the allele-specific primer. Note that optimization is \nsimpler than for the full crossover assay since only one allele-specific primer is being \nused. \n2. Dilute the primary PCR products with 35 \u00b5L 5 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 plus 2 \u00b5g\/mL high \nmolecular weight herring or salmon DNA as carrier. Seed 15 \u00b5L secondary PCRs \ncontaining the nested allele-specific primer and nested universal primer with 0.6 \u00b5L \ndiluted primary PCR product and amplify under optimized conditions for 36 cycles. \n3. Test 0.6 \u00b5L of a selection of secondary PCRs by agarose gel electrophoresis and staining \nwith ethidium bromide. Check that the correct-sized PCR product (typically 5-10 kb in \nthese assays) has been generated and that PCR product yields are high and uniform over \nthe reactions. \n4. Before dotblotting, add the non-selected haplotype, amplified separately, to five wells on \nthe secondary PCR plate such that the ratio of non-selected to selected haplotype PCR \nproducts is 1:10, 1:30, 1:100, 1:300 and 1:1000. These wells will serve as positive controls \nto determine the level of allele-specificity of hybridization for each ASO, as well as \nestimating the proportion of recombinant DNA in pools showing a putative crossover or \nconversion. \n5. Denature the secondary PCRs and prepare as many replica dotblots as required (see \nSection 3.3.2). \n20. Kauppi et al. 27 \n6. Hybridize dotblots with each ASO to detect alleles from the non-selected haplotype (see \nSection 3.3.3). \n7. Score autoradiographs for the presence of a crossover or non-exchange conversion in each \nsecondary PCR. Crossovers will be clearly evident from the presence of a succession of \npositive markers extending continuously towards the distal end of the test interval (Fig. 5). \nConversions involving more than one SNP site will also be clear from adjacent markers \nbeing positive. Single-site conversions will show as single markers with a positive signal, \nand with a signal level corresponding to at least 1% of PCR product being derived from \nthe recombinant. Crossovers (which are always genuine recombinant molecules) provide a \nuseful internal control to demonstrate proper signal intensities. Very faint (<<1%) single-\nsite signals should be rejected as PCR mis-incorporations. Blood DNA, which is free from \nrecombinants, can be processed in parallel to give more information on the likely \nincidence and signal intensities of mis-incorporation artifacts. \n8. The gene conversion frequency for each SNP site can be calculated by excluding all \ncrossover-positive PCRs in which conversions might be masked (Fig. 5), and counting the \nnumber of conversion-positive (p) and conversion-negative (n) PCRs for the remaining \np+n reactions. The Poisson-corrected total number of conversions (c) per PCR is estimated \nby \u2013ln[n\/(p+n)], and the conversion frequency is thus given by c\/t, where t is the mean \nnumber of amplifiable molecules of each haplotype present per PCR (in this example, 40). \n9. If desired, crossover-positive PCRs can be further analyzed by allele-specific PCR \ndirected to a distal SNP site (Fig. 5). This allows crossover molecules and non-crossovers \n(including progenitors) to be amplified separately prior to mapping. \n \n20. Kauppi et al. 28 \n3.5. DNA enrichment by allele-specific hybridization (DEASH) \nDEASH is a pre-PCR DNA enrichment strategy that both facilitates the detection of de \nnovo non-crossover gene conversion events and serves to verify their authenticity (24). By \nhybridizing a biotinylated ASO to denatured sperm DNA, molecules containing a known single-\nnucleotide variant can be captured on streptavidin-coated paramagnetic beads whilst those \nbearing the alternative variant can be removed by washing. On subsequent release from the \nbeads, this specifically enriched single-stranded DNA can be analyzed by allele-specific PCR \n(see Section 3.2). Gene conversion and crossover events are thus detected by enriching for a \nvariant specific to one haplotype then amplifying pools of this enriched DNA using primers \nspecific to the opposite haplotype (see Fig. 6). \nThe enrichment procedure reduces the complexity of the DNA and therefore improves \nthe signal-to-noise ratio in the PCR such that pools of enriched DNA derived from large amounts \nof genomic DNA can be screened for recombinants. Since gene conversion tracts are very short \n(25), the ability to detect such events depends on having SNP markers very close to the center of \nthe hotspot. If there is more than one SNP requiring analysis, then separate enrichment of each \nSNP will need to be carried out. The level of enrichment achievable can be 300-fold or higher. \nUnlike the half crossover assay alone (Section 3.4), pre-processing DNA with DEASH allows \nthe detection of very rare events, with a frequency of 10-6 or lower, even if they only affect a \nsingle SNP site. These single-site conversions should only affect the selected SNP and not a non-\nselected SNP. This provides validation for such events and helps establish that they are not PCR \nmis-incorporations (see also Section 3.4.7). \n \n3.5.1. The DEASH Procedure \n20. Kauppi et al. 29 \nTo maximize the yield of recovered DNA, cleave sperm genomic DNA with a restriction \nenzyme that cuts just outside the region of interest; undigested DNA gives very poor yields. We \nhave successfully used the DEASH protocol to enrich for genomic restriction fragments up to \n12.5 kb in size. Digest according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, supplemented if necessary \nwith spermidine trichloride to a final concentration of 4 mM to improve digestion. After \ndigestion, ethanol precipitate the genomic DNA, wash with 80% ethanol, dry and dissolve in 5 \nmM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) to a final concentration of 0.2-1 mg\/mL (see also Section 3.1.1, steps 8-\n9). \nIt is necessary to determine empirically the annealing temperature (A\u00b0) of each \nbiotinylated ASO before bulk genomic DNA is processed in order to maximize both yield and \nthe degree of allele separation. As a guide, the relationship between optimal annealing \ntemperature and GC content of a bio-ASO approximates to 29.6\u00b0C + 0.318(%GC)\u00b0C in the \nbuffer used for hybridization (24). However, the efficiency of allele separation is very much \nASO-dependent (see Table 5). \n \n3.5.2. Annealing temperature titration \nThroughout the procedure use dedicated \u201cpre-PCR\u201d pipettes for manipulations. \nTypically, we test annealing temperatures over the range of 30-60\u00b0C in 5\u00b0C increments using 0.1 \n\u00b5g of digested genomic DNA in a 20 \u00b5L volume. The following should be scaled according to \nthe number of annealing temperatures to be tested. \n1. Set \u201cannealing\u201d waterbath to A\u00b0C and \u201celution\u201d waterbath to 60\u00b0C. \n2. Prepare 210 \u00b5L of 1x DHB for bead preparation, keep at room temperature; 21 \u00b5L 10x \nDHB plus 189 \u00b5L ddH2O. \n20. Kauppi et al. 30 \n3. Prepare 100 \u00b5L of DHB\/BSA wash solution and place in \u201cannealing\u201d waterbath; 10 \u00b5L \n10x DHB, 88 \u00b5L ddH2O plus 2 \u00b5L 500 \u00b5g\/mL BSA. \n4. Aliquot 50 \u00b5L of ED solution, keep at room temperature. \n5. Aliquot a further 100 \u00b5L of ED solution and place in \u201celution\u201d waterbath. \n6. Gently agitate to re-suspend the M-280 Streptavidin Dynabeads, then aliquot 21 \u00b5L into a \nsiliconized 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. Pre-wash the beads twice in 1x DHB buffer: place the \ntube in the Dynal magnetic particle concentrator, leave for 10 s, then twist each way until \nthe beads have formed a small mass, aspirate off liquid, then remove tube from \nconcentrator and re-suspend bead mass in 100 \u00b5L 1x DHB by gentle pipetting, repeat \nprocedure. Finally, re-pellet beads and re-suspend in 1.5 \u00b5L of 1x DHB (i.e. 1\/14th the \noriginal volume of the beads). Keep on ice until needed. \n7. In a 0.2 mL PCR tube add 2 \u00b5L 10x DHB, 1.5 \u00b5L 5 \u00b5M biotinylated ASO, 1 \u00b5L 30 \u00b5M \nnon-biotinylated competitor ASO, 0.1 \u00b5g digested genomic DNA and make up to 20 \u00b5L \nwith ddH2O. \n8. Place tube in a PCR machine and denature the DNA at 96\u00b0C for 75 s, then step down the \ntemperature to allow the bio-ASO to anneal to the target DNA starting at A+9\u00b0C and \ngoing down to A+1\u00b0C in 1\u00b0C steps for 20 s per step. Anneal at A\u00b0C for 2 min. \n9. During the annealing step, pre-warm a siliconized 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube containing 1.3 \n\u00b5L of washed beads in a waterbath set at A\u00b0C. \n10. Transfer the contents of the PCR tube to the pre-warmed tube containing the beads, mix \nextremely gently and incubate for 10 min at A\u00b0C. Ensure the beads remain suspended \nduring this time by very carefully flicking the contents of the tube every couple of \n20. Kauppi et al. 31 \nminutes. Binding of the bio-ASO to the streptavidin-coated beads appears to be complete \nwithin about 5 minutes, even for large DNA targets. \n11. Use the magnetic concentrator to pellet the beads. Remove the supernatant containing the \nunbound DNA, but keep this fraction if you wish to re-extract DNA from it (see Section \n3.5.4, step 2) \n12. Re-suspend the beads and captured DNA hybrids in 50 \u00b5L of the DHB\/BSA wash \nsolution. Pipette very gently and transfer to a fresh siliconized 1.5 mL tube and incubate \nat A\u00b0C for 1 min. \n13. Repeat steps 11-12, to remove the last traces of unbound DNA. \n14. Repeat steps 11-12, this time re-suspending the beads in the 50 \u00b5L of room temperature \nelution buffer ED and transferring to a fresh siliconized tube at the same temperature. \n15. Repeat step 14, using the 60\u00b0C elution buffer. \n16. Incubate for 2 min at 60\u00b0C to release the target DNA from the biotinylated ASO\/bead \ncomplex. Use the magnetic concentrator to remove the beads and recover the eluted DNA \n(supernantant) into a siliconized 1.5 mL tube. \n17. Turn up \u201celution\u201d waterbath containing the remaining elution buffer to 70\u00b0C.  \n18. Repeat steps 15-16 to release any remaining DNA. \n \n3.5.3. Determining yield and allele separation \nYields of each haplotype are estimated by comparing allele-specific PCR amplification \n(see Section 3.2) of a range of concentrations of input DNA with recovered DNA on ethidium \nbromide-stained gels. This also allows assessment of the degree of allele separation (Fig. 7). The \nPCR is limited to the exponential phase of amplification and yield estimation must take into \n20. Kauppi et al. 32 \naccount the fact that unfractionated double-stranded DNA results in twice as much PCR product \nas an equal number of recovered single-stranded molecules. Typically, 10 \u00b5L PCRs are seeded \nwith 4% of each eluate (2 \u00b5L) and the control input series corresponds to that expected for 100% \ndown to 0.5% yields. In addition to evaluating the optimal annealing temperature, the best \nelution temperature can also be determined. Note that the elution buffer ED is 0.14x PCR buffer \nless dNTPs and BSA; PCR setup should take this buffer into account. \n \n3.5.4. Processing bulk genomic DNA by DEASH \n1.  Up to 2 \u00b5g of digested genomic DNA can be processed per 20-\u00b5L volume as described in \nSection 3.5.1. If larger quantities are required then set up multiple 40 \u00b5L volumes with 4 \n\u00b5g of DNA each and double the volumes described in the protocol. In our experience, it \nis difficult to keep the beads suspended in larger volumes than this. \n2. Yields can be increased by re-extracting the remaining target from the unbound fraction \nobtained in step 11 of Section 3.5.1. Place the unbound fraction in a 0.2 mL PCR tube \nand add 5 \u00b5M biotinylated ASO to a final concentration of 0.375 \u00b5M. Proceed from step \n8 of Section 3.5.1 using the optimal annealing and elution temperatures. This re-\nextraction can be set up immediately on separating the first unbound DNA; re-extraction \nthus proceeds through the denaturation, annealing and binding steps whilst washing and \nelution is carried out on the initially-bound DNA. More than 95% of the recoverable \nDNA will be obtained from three rounds of re-extraction. However, the degree of \npurification can decrease several fold with each re-extraction. \n3. Recovered DNA can also be subjected to a second round of purification using the same \nbiotinylated ASO. The same degree of purification is achieved at each cycle such that a \n20. Kauppi et al. 33 \n20-fold purification obtained with one round equates to a 400-fold purification after the \nsecond. However, the percentage recovery per round remains roughly constant such that \nthe yield declines proportionally. To re-purify the eluted DNA in ED buffer, add DHB to \n1x (note that ED is already 0.14x DHB), biotinylated ASO to 0.375 \u00b5M and non-\nbiotinylated competitor ASO to 1.5 \u00b5M. Proceed as for the first purification, starting at \nstep 8 of Section 3.5.1. \n4. When target fragments contain Alu elements, yields can sometimes be improved by \nadding Alu competitor DNA to suppress networking of the genomic DNA via Alu-Alu \nhybridization during the annealing step of the DEASH procedure. The competitor can be \nmade by PCR using consensus sequence-derived primers Alu-F and Alu-R. Initially seed \na 10 \u00b5L PCR containing 0.9 \u00b5L of 11.1x PCR buffer (see Section 2.2.1) along with 0.5 \n\u00b5M of each primer and 50 ng of human genomic DNA. Cycle for [96\u00baC 20 s, 52\u00baC 30 s, \n70\u00baC for 1 min] for 2 cycles, followed by a further 2 cycles annealing at 55\u00baC and then \nfinally 12 cycles annealing at 58\u00baC. The initial low annealing temperature should allow \namplification of diverged Alu elements whilst the later higher annealing temperature is \noptimal for this primer pair. Re-amplify by seeding 400 \u00b5L of PCR mix with 4 \u00b5L of the \nPCR product and splitting mix into eight 50-\u00b5L reactions. Use 17 cycles at the higher \nannealing temperature, gel-purify the 270 bp product, ethanol precipitate and dissolve in \n100 \u00b5L 5 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5. Estimate yield by gel electrophoresis. Irradiate on a UV \ntransilluminator for 5 min to render the DNA recalcitrant to further PCR amplification. \nAdd the Alu competitor to a final concentration of 2.5 \u00b5g\/mL at step 7 of Section 3.5.2. \n5. Screen enriched DNA for recombinants as described in Section 3.5.5. \n \n20. Kauppi et al. 34 \n3.5.5. Detecting gene conversions and crossovers in DNA enriched by DEASH \nRecombinant detection in the half-crossover assay is limited by the progenitor haplotype \nmolecules present in each pool. As described in Section 3.5, DEASH allows genomic DNA to be \nfractionated to enrich for molecules containing a specific allele at a given SNP, thus depleting \nfractionated DNA in one of the two progenitor haplotypes. As shown in Fig. 6B, a half-crossover \nassay directed to the depleted haplotype will remove the selected progenitor haplotype, greatly \nfacilitating the detection of crossover and conversion events. By way of example, suppose that \nDEASH has been performed on 12 \u00b5g sperm DNA (106 amplifiable molecules of each \nhaplotype) to give a 200-fold enrichment of the selected haplotype and a 50% yield. The \nenriched single-stranded DNA will therefore contain 500,000 molecules of the selected \nhaplotype and 2,500 remaining molecules of the unselected haplotype. The DNA can thus be \nanalyzed by the half crossover method, amplifying the unselected haplotype exactly as in \nSection 3.4, in a single plate with just 26 (2,500\/96) progenitor molecules per PCR, allowing the \ndetection of recombinants (both crossovers and conversions) as rare as 0.0002% (1\/500,000). \nRecombinant detection and interpretation, and the Poisson correction of data, are performed \nexactly as in the half crossover assay (see Section 3.4). \n \n4. Notes \n1. At this step, it is not necessary to add salt, as there is enough SSC and SDS in the sample \nto allow the DNA to precipitate. \n2. Allele-specific primers can sometimes behave slightly differently in each batch of 11.1x \nPCR buffer. It is best to make a large enough batch of 11.1x buffer to last through \noptimizations and the desired crossover assays. If you run out of 11.1x buffer in the \n20. Kauppi et al. 35 \nmiddle of a crossover assay, you may need to re-optimize the allele-specific primers in \nthe new batch of buffer. \n3.  We find that using this relatively low extension temperature of 65\u00b0C increases the \nefficiency of amplification, especially for AT-rich amplicons, and reduces the incidence \nof jumping-PCR artifacts arising by annealing of incompletely extended PCR products. \nThis reduction is especially important in the final crossover assay in which jumping PCR \ncould generate false recombinants. \n4.  An ideal allele-specific primer will show, at one or more annealing temperatures, both \ngood efficiency with PCR product yields from the correct homozygote comparable to \nthose obtained with a universal primer, and good specificity with little if any detectable \nPCR product being generated from DNA from someone homozygous for the alternative \nallele. Low-efficiency primers can be modified by adding synthetic 5' extensions (see \nSection 3.2.1) and low-specificity primers can be shortened by one or more bases; these \nmodifications can sometimes, but not always, substantially improve primer performance. \n5.  This step removes single-stranded DNA from PCR products prior to re-amplification with \nnested primers. S1 digestion improves the specificity of nested allele-specific primers and \nremoves PCR artifacts such as panhandle loops structures that can interfere with \ncrossover detection (18). However, most crossover assays can be performed successfully \nwithout this step. \n6.  Tertiary PCR products can be typed for internal SNP markers in several ways, for \nexample sequencing. Here, we describe a straightforward dotblot hybridization protocol \nthat requires no specialist equipment. We type SNPs by hybridization of ASOs to \ndotblots of PCR products using a modification of the TMAC hybridization protocol \n20. Kauppi et al. 36 \n((32)). TMAC allows oligonucleotides of differing GC content to be hybridized at the \nsame temperature, greatly facilitating typing. Note that TMAC is toxic! \n7.  If you are labeling several ASOs, make a master mix of the kinase mix plus [\u03b3-32P]-ATP \nplus T4 kinase, then aliquot 9 \u00b5L per ASO and add the ASO to each aliquot. \n8. If the ASO shows any lack of specificity, try re-washing for 20 min in TMAC wash \nsolution at a higher temperature (e.g. 56\u00b0C or 60\u00b0C) as in Section 3.3.3, steps 5-7. \n9.  Most ASOs are very specific, showing >100:1 discrimination between alleles. However, \nrecombinant detection is limited by PCR mis-incorporations, which can arise in small \nDNA pools early during PCR to give artifact signals that can appear to be single site \nconversions. Different SNPs show different artifact levels, with transition SNPs (C\/T, \nA\/G) being most prone to switching by mis-incorporation. In practice, both mis-\nincorporation and ASO specificity mean that pool sizes have to be limited to 50 molecules \nat most, and preferably less. One 96-well plate will therefore allow at most only 4800 \nmolecules to be screened for recombinants, limiting analysis to only the most active \nhotspots with recombination frequencies above 0.1%. \n \nAcknowledgments \nDevelopment of these methods was carried out at the University of Leicester with \ngenerous support by grants to A.J.J. from The Medical Research Council, The Louis-Jeantet \nFoundation and The Royal Society.

(A) The \nfirst step is the discovery of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, shown as grey circles) and \nLD mapping, allowing the identification of LD blocks (grey boxes) and regions where LD breaks \ndown (gap between grey boxes). Such regions of LD breakdown are putative recombination \nhotspots. (B) For putative recombination hotspot regions, two rounds of allele-specific PCR are \nperformed on batches of sperm DNA from an individual with multiple SNP heterozygosities \n(black and white circles). Allele-specific primers are shown as black and white arrowheads. \nRecombinant sperm DNA molecules are selectively amplified, and the location of crossover \nbreakpoints can be subsequently mapped by typing internal SNPs. \n \nFig. 2. Principle of linkage phasing. Heterozygous selector SNPs are depicted as black and white \ncircles, forward allele-specific primers (F1 and F2) and allele-specific reverse primers (R1 and \nR2) as black or white arrowheads. To determine the linkage phase of selector SNPs, PCR is \nperformed using all four possible combinations of each allele-specific forward and reverse \nprimer, in this example using F1-R2 combinations (rows 1-4). \n \nFig. 3. Schematic representation of crossover-positive secondary PCRs at input pool sizes of \n2000, 600 and 200 DNA molecules, with eight PCRs per pool size. Here, eleven reactions \n(labelled 1-11) are positive for a crossover (e.g. 7\/8 reactions at 2000 molecule input). The input \npools shown would contain 2.08, 0.47 and 0.13 crossovers per reaction at 2000, 600 and 200 \nmolecule input, respectively (see Section 3.2.4.4, step 1), giving approximate crossover \nfrequencies of 1.0x10-3, 0.78x10-3 and 0.65x10-3 respectively. \n20. Kauppi et al. 43 \n \nFig. 4. Principle of crossover breakpoint mapping, (A) In the crossover assay, if forward primers \nare allele-specific for the A haplotype (black), and reverse primers for the B haplotype (white; \nallele-specific primers AS), \"A to B\" crossovers are amplified. Crossover-positive reactions and \nprogenitor haplotypes A and B are re-amplified with universal primers (U). Five internal \nheterozygous SNP sites (numbered 3-7) and their inter-marker distances are shown. SNPs 1, 2, 8 \nand 9 are selector sites for allele-specific PCR. (B) Dotblot positions of progenitor haplotypes A \nand B, plus the 11 hypothetical crossover positives from the different input pools (1-11) from \nFig. 3 are shown. (C) Dotblots on the left are probed with ASOs targeted towards haplotype A \nalleles at heterozygous SNP sites (5' to 3', top to bottom: SNPs 3-7), while dotblots on the right \nare probed with ASOs specific for haplotype B. The haplotypic origin of each allele is identified \nfrom progenitor haplotype dots. Filled circles are positive for that particular haplotype, open \ndashed circles are negative (see Table 3A for crossover scoring). (D) Grey bars indicate \nrecombination activity for each SNP interval (see Table 4A-B and Section 3.3.4. step 2 for \ncalculations). The Poisson-corrected number of crossovers (rounded to nearest full number) \nobserved in each interval is shown above each bar. \n \nFig. 5. Detecting crossovers and non-exchange gene conversions by the half-crossover assay. \nMultiple small pools (labeled A-D) of sperm DNA from a man carrying multiple SNP \nheterozygosities (white and black circles) are amplified by nested long PCR using allele-specific \nprimers (white arrowheads) directed to white alleles plus universal primers (grey arrowheads). \nPCR products are then probed using ASOs specific to alleles from the unselected black \nhaplotype. Various outcomes are possible in each pool. A, PCR products are derived only from \n20. Kauppi et al. 44 \nwhite progenitor molecules. B, the pool contains a crossover in addition to progenitors, yielding \na continuous block of positive markers distal to the selector sites. Note that any additional \ncrossovers in this pool with exchange points mapping 3\u2019 to the observed crossover would not be \ndetectable. C, the pool contains a non-exchange gene conversion molecule, in this case affecting \njust one SNP. D, a complex pool containing two conversions and one crossover. The double-site \nconversion is masked by the crossover, and the single site conversion plus crossover appear as a \nsingle crossover with the exchange point mapping to the wrong interval. Pools B and D can be \ndistinguished by further allele-specific PCR directed for example to the terminal SNP (marked \nwith an asterisk), which allows crossovers and conversions to be separately amplified from \nnested PCR products prior to mapping. \n \nFig. 6. Principle of DEASH and subsequent detection of recombinants. (A) Digested double-\nstranded genomic DNA containing equal numbers of molecules differing by the chosen base \nsubstitution (circle) is mixed with a biotinylated ASO (bio-ASO, in black with biotin shown by a \ngrey square) and the corresponding competitor ASO (white). The DNA is thermally denatured \nand the ASOs anneal as the temperature is subsequently reduced. Streptavidin-coated \nparamagnetic beads are then added, allowing the bio-ASO\/target hybrid to be separated from the \nrest of the mixture with a magnet. The single-stranded target is released by thermal elution. The \nunbound fraction can be re-extracted by adding more bio-ASO, thus increasing the yield. \nRecovered fractions can be further enriched if additional bio-ASO and competitor ASO are \nadded and the procedure repeated. (B) The recovered single-stranded DNA is greatly enriched \nfor the selected haplotype (arrow indicates selector site, additional circles represent other SNP \nheterozygosities carried by this individual) (i). This facilitates detection of genuine recombinants \n20. Kauppi et al. 45 \nexchanged at the selector site (a, crossover; b, gene conversion) using pools of the enriched DNA \nin a half-crossover assay (ii). Two-rounds of nested PCR are performed using allele-specific \nprimers directed to the non-selected haplotype (white arrowheads) together with universal, i.e. \nnon-allele specific, primers (grey arrowheads). Recombinants are detected by the presence of \nmarkers from the selected parental haplotype (black markers) as determined by ASO typing. \n \nFig. 7. Determining optimal yield and degree of purification post-DEASH. (A) Restricted DNA \nis enriched for molecules carrying the black allele (circle) using a biotinylated ASO as indicated \nby the arrow. Yield and purification are established by setting up two parallel sets of PCRs, one \nusing an allele-specific primer directed against the selected haplotype (black triangle), the other \nusing an allele-specific primer directed against the other haplotype (white triangle). The same \nreverse strand primer is used for both (grey triangle). Comparisons are made with the signals \nobtained from unfractionated DNA. (B) Hypothetical results from the DEASH eluates obtained \nusing three different annealing temperatures (A1\u00b0; A2\u00b0, A3\u00b0) and three sequential elution \ntemperatures (room temperature [rt], 60\u00b0C, 70\u00b0C). Regardless of annealing temperature, little \ntarget is released either at the rt or 70\u00b0C elution steps; the majority of DNA can be recovered by \nsimply raising the elution temperature to 60\u00b0C. The yield of selected haplotype is determined as \n~75%, ~50% and ~3% for annealing temperatures A1\u00b0, A2\u00b0, A3\u00b0 respectively. The degree of \npurification is determined from the non-selected haplotype PCRs; for example, for A2\u00b0, the \nsignal is approximately equivalent to that from the 0.5% input control, such that fraction is \nenriched 100 fold (=50\/0.5) for the selected haplotype. This degree of purification appears better \nthan that obtained at A1\u00b0 (12.5 fold [75\/6]), so bulk fractionation would best be carried out at \nA2\u00b0. \n20. Kauppi et al. 46 \nTable 1.

Crossover-positive pools that \ncontain crossover mixtures spanning more than one interval (in grey italics) are excluded for all \nSNP sites that lie between the two SNP intervals where crossover breakpoints were scored. For \nexample, crossover 6 is excluded for the SNP4-SNP5 interval. The total number of molecules \nscreened is lower for the SNP4-SNP5 and SNP5-SNP6 intervals (open box), as follows: 22,400 - \n(2x2000)=18,400, because two of the 2000-molecule input pools are excluded for these intervals. \n(B) The Poisson-corrected number of crossovers in each interval is determined, and if necessary \nadjusted upwards to take into account any PCRs in which mixed sites make crossover detection \nimpossible. Thus the Poisson-corrected number of crossovers in interval SNP4-SNP5 is adjusted \nby the factor 22,400\/18,400. Recombination activity per interval then is calculated from the \ncorrected number of crossovers and inter-marker distance. End interval crossovers (in \nparentheses) are scored as normal but we exclude them from further analyses if they are likely to \nresult from parental haplotype bleed-through amplification (see Section 3.3.4). \n \nA number of crossover positive + negative reactions for each SNP interval, in each input pool\ninput pool SNP2 to SNP3 SNP3 to SNP4 SNP4 to SNP5 SNP5 to SNP6 SNP6 to SNP7 SNP7 to SNP8\n2000 1+7 2+6 1+5 3+3 5+3 0+8\n600 0+8 1+7 1+7 1+7 0+8 0+8\n200 0+8 0+8 1+7 0+8 0+8 0+8\nmolecules screened 22400 22400 18400 18400 22400 22400\nexclude exclude\ncrossover positivescrossover positives\n1 and 6 1 and 4\nPoisson-est. crossover frequency - 0.00015 0.00018 0.00027 0.00030 -\nB SNP2 to SNP3 SNP3 to SNP4 SNP4 to SNP5 SNP5 to SNP6 SNP6 to SNP7 SNP7 to SNP8\nuncorrected number of crossovers (1) 3 3 4 5 0 total: 16\nPoisson-corr. number of crossovers 0 3.4 3.3 5.0 6.7 0 total: 19.4\ninter-marker distance (bp) 1000 500 250 250 500 1500\ncM\/Mb (4.5) 30 72 108 60 0\n20.
