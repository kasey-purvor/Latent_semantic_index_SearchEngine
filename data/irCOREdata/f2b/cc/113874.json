This advection\u2013diffusion combination tends to homoge-\nnize the scalar and eventually the system evolves into a uniform steady state\nif there is no additional source of scalar. However if additional scalar is in-\njected into the flow via a steady source term, then, for a time periodic flow\nin a periodic domain, the system evolves into a periodic state, where scalar\ndiagnostics oscillate about some time\u2013averaged value (Thiffeault et al., 2004;\nDoering and Thiffeault, 2006). The efficiency of statistically stationary, ho-\nmogeneous, isotropic flows (which include turbulence) to mix scalars was ex-\namined by Doering and Thiffeault (2006). They calculate an upper bound for\nthe scalar concentration for various source terms; however the actual maxi-\nmum concentrations are sensitive to the velocity field, and in particular the\nexistence of periodic islands in the flow. Advection\u2013diffusion problems with a\nsource term are also important in the study of air pollution (Tirabassi, 1989);\nthus understanding how much pollutant builds up in stagnant regions, such as\nislands, is very important. This study is therefore motivated by trying to un-\nderstand better how scalar builds up in the presence of these islands, including\nthe dependence on the size of the islands.\nIn the current study we examine the periodic states of time periodic flows by\nconsidering a scalar tracer which is injected steadily into an unsteady, two\u2013\ndimensional, periodic velocity field. We choose the velocity field\nu(x, y, t) = 2 cos2(\u03c9t)(0, sinx) + 2 sin2(\u03c9t)(sin y, 0), (1.1)\nwhich, depending on the value of \u03c9, is either globally chaotic or consists of\nperiodic islands embedded in a chaotic sea. This flow, which is a modification\nof the time\u2013periodic sine flow (TPSF), is chosen so we can investigate how the\nsteady state is dependent on the islands. By varying the control parameter \u03c9\nwe can change the period of the flow and hence the size of the periodic islands,\nand for certain values of \u03c9 the islands disappear altogether. The evolution of\nscalar in this flow in the absence of a source term has been studied by Cerbelli\net al. (2003) and Giona et al. (2004). It is well known that periodic islands\ninhibit mixing by trapping scalar within them (Wiggins and Ottino, 2004;\nGleeson, 2005), but a thorough study investigating the quantity of scalar that\nbuilds up in islands in the presence of a source term has not been carried out\nto date. Gleeson (2005) studies the evolution of a strip of scalar placed inside\na flow field for two initial conditions, one when the scalar crosses a periodic\nisland, and one where it does not. The results show that the scalar initially\nwithin the island winds up and homogenizes, but stays within the island, while\nthe other case shows that the scalar becomes well mixed in the surrounding\n2\nchaotic sea without being transported into the periodic island. In this example\na mixing measure m(t) is defined, which in a \u2018vortexlike mixing period\u2019 decays\nas Pe\u2212\u03b1 where Pe is the Pe\u00b4clet number (proportional to the inverse of the\nmolecular diffusion) and \u03b1 is a real scaling exponent. However in the current\nstudy the presence of a steady source means that there will be a continuous\ninjection of scalar both into the islands and the chaotic region. The work of\nDoering and Thiffeault (2006) confirms that there will be an upper bound on\nthe scalar value in the islands, but we will show a correlation between the\ntime\u2013averaged maximum scalar value in the islands and their size, for varying\n\u03ba.\nBy considering time averages over one period of the flow field, we produce\nscalar diagnostics that are steady and hence are easier to analyze. We shall\nconsider the evolution of both the time\u2013averaged maximum scalar value Cmax\nand the time\u2013averaged contour length, as functions of the molecular diffusion\n\u03ba. The case of a slowly varying velocity field (small \u03c9) is examined analytically\nby studying the time\u2013periodic sine flow (TPSF) which has a velocity field\nthat instantaneously switches between u = (0, 2 sinx) and u = (2 sin y, 0)\nperiodically with period 2ts. By the use of matched asymptotic expansions we\ndetermine how Cmax, and subsequently Cmax, vary with \u03ba.\nAs well as these diagnostics another useful measure is the effective diffu-\nsion of the scalar field. Transforming the advection\u2013diffusion equation using\na quasi\u2013Lagrangian coordinate system (Butchart and Remsberg, 1986) based\non the area inside scalar concentration contours (Nakamura, 1996; Winters\nand D\u2019Asaro, 1996), leads to a pure diffusion equation, where the diffusion\ncoefficient is known as the effective diffusion. The effective diffusion is a useful\ndiagnostic tool because it requires no prior knowledge of the velocity field, as it\ndepends solely on the instantaneous distribution of the scalar field. This makes\nit a very attractive tool for studying mixing and transport properties of com-\nplicated systems such as the atmosphere (Haynes and Shuckburgh, 2000a,b).\nSystematic studies of this diagnostic tool have shown that areas of high effec-\ntive diffusion correspond to areas of well mixed scalar and areas of low effective\ndiffusion occur in regions of poorly mixed scalar, such as in periodic islands\n(Shuckburgh and Haynes, 2003; Turner et al., 2008). For this reason we adopt\nthe effective diffusion in this study to compare the relative sizes of the well\nmixed region of the time\u2013averaged effective diffusion for a flow with periodic\nislands and one without islands.\nThe present paper is laid out as follows. In \u00a72 we formulate the problem\nand discuss the numerical scheme used to calculate the scalar field. In \u00a73 we\nexamine the kinematic behaviour of the flow. A careful study determines the\nparameter values for which we have periodic islands embedded in a chaotic\nflow and for which values we apparently have a globally chaotic flow. Section\n4 presents the results of the numerical simulations of the advection\u2013diffusion\n3\nequation including effective diffusion calculations and an analytical result for\nthe TPSF problem. Our concluding remarks and some discussion are given in\n\u00a75.\n2 Formulation and numerical scheme\nIn an incompressible fluid flow, the evolution of a scalar tracer that has con-\ncentration c(x, t) is governed by the advection\u2013diffusion equation\n\u2202c\n\u2202t\n+ u \u00b7 \u2207c = \u2207 \u00b7 (\u03ba\u2207c) + S, (2.1)\nwhere u is a prescribed incompressible velocity field, \u03ba(x, t) is the molecular\nscalar diffusion and S(x, t) is a source term. The current work uses the two\u2013\ndimensional flow field given by (1.1) where \u03c9 is a real frequency and x and\ny are Cartesian coordinates. For simplicity we also consider the case when\n\u03ba(x, t) is constant and the source term S(x, t) = cos x which is steady and has\nzero mean.\nThis study examines the long time behaviour of (2.1) where, due to the pres-\nence of the source, the behaviour of the scalar field eventually becomes peri-\nodic in time and, from a Lagrangian point of view, the source term balances\nmolecular diffusion over one period.\nAlthough small scales are generated in the scalar field, the specified velocity\nfield is smooth and large scale. Consequently, the Lagrangian timescale of the\nscalar in this problem is much longer than the Eulerian timescale. The problem\ntherefore lends itself to solution by a semi\u2013Lagrangian method (e.g. Staniforth\nand Co\u02c6te\u00b4, 1991). We use cubic Lagrange interpolation for the scalar advection,\nwith a Crank\u2013Nicolson treatment of the diffusion term. This makes the scheme\nsecond\u2013order accurate in time overall and allows much longer time steps \u2206t\nto be used, without losing accuracy or stability, than would be possible with\nthe Eulerian scheme used by Turner et al. (2008). Thus, the computation time\nrequired to reach the periodic state is greatly reduced. Nevertheless, we still\nfind ourselves restricted in our parameter search by the computational time\nrequired to complete the runs. This is discussed further in \u00a74.\n3 Kinematic properties of the flow\nBefore embarking on a full numerical simulation of (2.1), we consider the\nkinematic properties of the flow field (1.1) by examining Poincare\u00b4 sections of\nits structure.\n4\nTo calculate the Poincare\u00b4 sections, we first write the flow field as a system of\ntwo first order differential equations\ndx\ndt\n= 2 sin2(\u03c9t) sin y,\ndy\ndt\n= 2 cos2(\u03c9t) sinx. (3.1)\nThese equations are then integrated from the set of initial conditions (x0, 0)\nand (x0, pi) where\nx0 = \u2212pi + 2pi(j \u2212 1)\/(N \u2212 1) j = 1, 2, 3, ..., N,\nand for each initial condition the position of the fluid particle is represented\nby a dot in real space after each period of the flow T = pi\/\u03c9. For the resulting\nPoincare\u00b4 sections in figure 1,N = 30 and for \u03c9 \u2264 0.5 we integrated to t = 400T\nand to t = 200T otherwise.\nFor large frequencies the direction of the shear flow changes rapidly and the re-\nsults show that the Poincare\u00b4 section has a cellular structure with four periodic\n\u2018islands\u2019 centred at (0,\u00b1pi) and (\u00b1pi, 0). Between these islands is a thin band\nof chaos which increases in thickness as \u03c9 is reduced. This can be seen when\nmoving from \u03c9 = 3.5 in figure 1(f) to \u03c9 = 2 in figure 1(e). As \u03c9 is decreased\nfurther the size of the islands is reduced also because the longer flow period\nmeans that fluid particles are stretched out much further and so any island\nregions are eventually stretched out and removed. At \u03c9 \u2248 0.75 the islands dis-\nappear completely and we apparently have a globally chaotic flow. A globally\nchaotic flow can be seen in figure 1(b) where \u03c9 = 0.5. However when \u03c9 = 0.3\nwe find that the globally chaotic flow changes to one with small islands around\n(0,\u00b1pi) and (\u00b1pi, 0). Further reducing \u03c9 (not shown here) shows that \u03c9 = 0.2\nis fully chaotic, but \u03c9 = 0.1 again has small islands. This is a resonant effect\nsimilar to that seen in the Mathieu equation (Nayfeh and Mook, 1979). Thus\nit is not true to say that the flow has islands for \u03c9 & 0.75: and is globally\nchaotic for \u03c9 . 0.75, instead we have to be careful that our choice of \u03c9 gener-\nates a window where the flow does not contain islands if we wish to examine\na globally chaotic flow. When we inject scalar into a globally chaotic flow we\nexpect the scalar field to be well mixed and the maximum value of scalar Cmax\nto be less than a flow case where there are islands present, as scalar builds up\nin such islands.\nWe can examine for which values of \u03c9 we expect to see the resonant islands\naround the points (\u00b1pi, 0) and (0,\u00b1pi) by studying a local solution about (pi, 0).\nThus inserting x\u2032 = x\u2212 pi and y\u2032 = y into (3.1) and linearising leads to\ndx\u2032\ndt\n= 2 sin2(\u03c9t)y\u2032,\ndy\u2032\ndt\n= \u22122 cos2(\u03c9t)x\u2032. (3.2)\n(The other three points lead to either the same system of equations, or one\nwith the minus sign swapped over).

With these initial conditions we check the linear stability of (3.2)\nand we assume that linear stability implies islands in the Poincare\u00b4 section\nand linear instability implies a globally chaotic flow. The results for the one\nparameter family \u03c9 are shown in figure 2(a), where the value 1 on the vertical\naxis represents chaos and 0 represents periodic orbits or islands. The results\nshow that for \u03c9 & 1.45 there are always islands about this point as can be\nseen in figure 1(e) and (f). However as \u03c9 is reduced they disappear and then\nreappear at a more and more rapid rate when \u03c9 . 0.2. The rate at which\nthese islands appear and disappear can be seen in figure 2(b), which plots\npanel (a) as a function of 1\/\u03c9.

Note that for \u03c9 & 0.75 the flow\ncan have islands at points corresponding to (x, y) 6= (\u00b1pi, 0) and (0,\u00b1pi) (cf\nfigures 1(c) and 1(d)), whereas for \u03c9 < 0.75 they only appear to occur at these\nfour points. It is feasible that resonant islands could occur at points other than\nthe four mentioned above, but our exploration of the \u03c9\u2212space considered in\nthis paper has not revealed any such points. Thus we assume that the four\npoints considered here are the only such points.\nNow that we know when and where the periodic islands appear in the flow field\nwe can solve the advection\u2013diffusion equation (2.1) and examine the evolution\nof the scalar field.\n4 Numerical evolution of scalar field and steady state analysis\nIn this section we numerically study the solution of (2.1) in the large t limit\nwhere the scalar field has become periodic, due to the injection from the steady\nsource. We demonstrate how the periodic scalar field and the length of various\nscalar contours vary over a period of the flow field, and we also show how Cmax\nvaries with \u03ba by time averaging the maximum value of the scalar field. This\nsection ends with an analytical approach to solve the case where (1.1) has small\n\u03c9. For this study we use the source distribution S(x) = cos x. Initially we set\nthe scalar concentration c(x, y, t = 0) = 0 and we let the system evolve with\ntime, which gives a transient regime for early times where the scalar increases\nfrom c = 0 up to the steady state. The length of time of this transient phase\ndepends on both \u03c9 and \u03ba, and increases for small \u03ba (inviscid flows) and large\n\u03c9 (short period flows). This limits the parameter range that we can study\n(mainly small \u03ba and moderate \u03ba with \u03c9 > 0.8), but this does not appear to\nrestrict any results in this paper.\n7\nTo analyze the scalar field in the periodic state we use the diagnostics Cmax(t)\nwhich is the maximum value of the scalar at any given time, and the length of\nthe contour c = C, which we denote by LC . Typically we consider the contour\nC = 0, as this contour always lies within the chaotic band regardless of the\nvalue of \u03c9, hence these results should be consistent. However we do look at\nother scalar contour lengths later in this section.\nIn the periodic regime, the scalar field varies over the duration of a flow period\nT = pi\/\u03c9 and time averaging these diagnostics of this regime gives correspond-\ning steady state quantities such as Cmax or LC . The variation of both Cmax\nand L0 for a selection of flow parameters is given in figure 3 as a function of\nt\/T .\n(a)\n30 30.5 31 31.5 32\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n30 30.5 31 31.5 322.5\n3\n3.5\n4\nt\nL0\nCmax\nT (b)\n400 400.5 401 401.5 40250\n100\n150\n400 400.5 401 401.5 40211\n11.5\n12\n12.5\nt\nL0\nCmax\nT\n(c)\n30 30.5 31 31.5 3210\n20\n30\n30 30.5 31 31.5 32\n4.8\n5\n5.2\nt\nL0\nCmax\nT (d)\n400 400.5 401 401.5 40270\n80\n90\n100\n110\n400 400.5 401 401.5 402\n91.4\n91.6\n91.8\n92\nt\nL0\nT\nCmax\nFig. 3. Plot of both Cmax and L0 as a function of t\/T for the cases (a)\n(\u03c9, \u03ba) = (0.5, 10\u22121), (b) (\u03c9, \u03ba) = (0.5, 10\u22123), (c) (\u03c9, \u03ba) = (1, 10\u22121) and (d)\n(\u03c9, \u03ba) = (1, 10\u22123). The dashed lines in each figure represent the equivalent value of\nCmax or L0\nFigure 3 graphs both Cmax and L0 for the parameter cases (\u03c9, \u03ba) = (0.5, 10\n\u22121),\n(\u03c9, \u03ba) = (0.5, 10\u22123), (\u03c9, \u03ba) = (1, 10\u22121) and (\u03c9, \u03ba) = (1, 10\u22123) in panels (a)\n8\nto (d) respectively. For each panel the respective time averaged value of the\ndiagnostic is given by the horizontal dotted line. We note that at the beginning\nand end of each period, the flow stretches the scalar approximately parallel to\nthe y\u2212axis, which is aligned with the source term, and for the middle of the\nflow period it is being stretched approximately parallel to the x\u2212axis which\nshears the scalar field and allows diffusion to act strongly on the fine scale\nstructure. The first thing to note in figure 3 is that in the results with islands\n(\u03c9 = 1) the variation of both Cmax and L0 is over a much smaller range of\nvalues. This is because the shear flow is changing direction much faster than\nin the \u03c9 = 0.5 case, and so the islands rotate from being positioned over a\nnegative part of the source to a position over a positive part or vice versa,\nthus not allowing large amounts of scalar to build up.\nThe general behaviour of the quantities in figure 3 is that both Cmax and L0\nincrease to some maximum value before rapidly decreasing to a minimum value\nafter the flow field has rotated. Note that the rotation is not instantaneous\nand any increase or decrease in diagnostic values is also due to the smooth\nrotation of the flow field. However it appears that the actual timing of these\nmaximum and minimum values is strongly linked to the values of \u03ba and \u03c9\nchosen. For example, for (\u03c9, \u03ba) = (0.5, 10\u22121) in panel (a) the maximum and\nminimum values of Cmax occur around t\/T = 30.5 and t\/T = 31 respectively\nand for L0 these are at t\/T = 30.75 and t\/T = 31 respectively. However as \u03c9\nis increased to 1 in panel (c) the maximum and minimum values of Cmax now\noccur at t\/T = 30.6 and t\/T = 30.25 and the L0 extremes have swapped over\nto t = 30T and t = 30T + T\/2 respectively. Similar variations can be seen by\nconsidering the \u03ba = 10\u22123 cases. The time lag between the flow field changing\nand the scalar field changing is apparent in this figure, and will play a role\nlater in determining how Cmax and LC behave for varying \u03c9 and \u03ba.\nThe results in figure 3 help us to understand how the scalar field behaves\nover the course of a time period of the flow. However to gain more insight we\nconsider the real space images of the scalar field which are plotted in figure 4.\nThis figure shows the four cases considered in figure 3 plotted at the midpoint\nof the period t = nT + 1\n2\nT (left panels) and the end point t = nT of the\nperiod (right panels), with red (mid grey) signifying large positive values and\ndark blue (dark grey) signifying large negative values of scalar. In each figure\nthe zero contour L0 is shown as the solid black line. For \u03c9 = 0.5 there are no\nislands in the flow field; this gives a scalar field with regions of long stretched\nout regions of scalar. This is clearly seen for the \u03ba = 10\u22123 in panels (c) and\n(d). We can also clearly see that the zero contour is much longer in this case\nthan the \u03ba = 10\u22121 case (panels (a) and (b)) due to its intricate form. As we\nincrease \u03c9 to 1 (i.e shorten the flow period and introduce islands to the flow\nfield) then we can see that the scalar field has a form which reflects the size of\nthe islands. For \u03ba = 10\u22121 (panels (e) and (f)) four regions of scalar build up\nand are relatively obvious but they are much clearer in the \u03ba = 10\u22123 result in\n9\n(a)\ny\nx (b)\ny\nx\n(c)\ny\nx (d)\ny\nx\n(e)\ny\nx (f)\ny\nx\n(g)\ny\nx (h)\ny\nx\nFig. 4. Plots of the scalar field c(x, y, t) in the periodically steady state at the\nmidpoint of a period (left panels) and the end of a period (right panels) for (a,b)\n(\u03c9, \u03ba) = (0.5, 10\u22121), (c,d) (\u03c9, \u03ba) = (0.5, 10\u22123), (e,f) (\u03c9, \u03ba) = (1, 10\u22121) and (g,h)\n(\u03c9, \u03ba) = (1, 10\u22123). Red (mid grey) corresponds to large positive values of c and\ndark blue (dark grey) corresponds to large negative c. The black line is the contour\nc = 0.\npanels (g) and (h) because the well mixed region of scalar is larger in this case\nand in this region the scalar homogenizes producing the green region (light\ngrey) seen in the panels. In this case one can see that the zero contour has\n10\npinched off into many smaller pieces, which allows diffusion to act and destroy\nthese fine pieces, as seen in panels (g) and (h) in conjunction with figure 3(d).\nFigure 3(d) shows that L0 decays from t\/T = 400 before growing to a small\npeak around t\/T = 400.5; there is then a rapid decay before rising sharply to\nthe peak value just before t\/T = 401. This is the shear flow breaking off the\nC = 0 contour into smaller pieces which are then stretched at first to give the\nincrease in L0. However they then become \u2018too\u2019 stretched and of a fine scale\nallowing diffusion to destroy these elements and giving the rapid drop in L0.\n(a)\n101\n102\n10-4 10-3 10-2 10-1\n\u03ba\n4\n3\n1&2\n(b)\n101\n102\n103\n10-4 10-3 10-2 10-1\n\u03ba\n1\n2\n3\n4\nFig. 5. Plot of LC(\u03ba) for (a) \u03c9 = 0.2 and (b) \u03c9 = 1 where the contours C = 0, 5\nand 20 are labelled 1\u2212 3 and line 4 is \u221d \u03ba\u22121\/2.\nIn figure 4 it is clear that as \u03ba is reduced L0 increases, but what is not so clear\nis how does the existence, or not, of islands affect the length of these contours\nand their dependence on \u03ba? This question is addressed in figure 5 which plots\nthe time\u2013averaged contour length for C = 0, 5 and 20 for both \u03c9 = 0.2 and\n1 as a function of \u03ba. For the flow with no islands (\u03c9 = 0.2) in panel (a) we\nsee that each of the three contour values has a length which grows almost as\n\u03ba\u22121\/2, which is represented by line 4; this is commonly observed in chaotic\nflows (Thiffeault, 2006). The C = 20 contour line (line 3) grows most like\n\u03ba\u22121\/2 while the C = 0 and 5 contour lines grow at a slightly slower rate. The\nL20 result initially grows at a different rate to the other two because when the\nC = 20 contour first exists for \u03ba = 10\u22122 this contour is in a region of low scalar\nstretching where the larger values of scalar are observed, and it is not until\n\u03ba = 0.003, where Cmax has increased, that it is in a region of the flow where\nthe contours grow more like \u03ba\u22121\/2. A similar situation occurs for a flow with\nislands (\u03c9 = 1) with the only apparent difference between this panel and that\nfor \u03c9 = 0.2 is now all three contours grow as \u03ba\u22121\/2 for small \u03ba. This shows\nthat in a flow without islands, the time\u2013averaged contour stretching is reduced\nin the middle of the chaotic band seen in figures 4(c) and 4(d). However this\nsubtle change in growth rate is not expected to be important in determining\nhow much scalar builds up in the islands, as many other factors are significant\ntoo.\n11\n(a)\n101\n102\n103\n10-4 10-3 10-2 10-1\nCmax\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n\u03ba (b)\n101\n102\n103\n10-4 10-3 10-2 10-1\n\u03ba\nCmax\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nFig. 6.

Plot of Cmax(\u03ba) on a log\u2013linear plot for \u03c9 = 0.2 and 0.5 marked as 3 and 5\nrespectively.\nIn figure 6 we plot Cmax(\u03ba) for various values of \u03c9 on a log\u2013log scale. In panel\n(a) we consider small values of \u03c9 = 0.01, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5 and 0.8 and these\nare labelled 1 \u2212 6 respectively, and in panel (b) we consider larger values of\n\u03c9 = 0.5, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0, 1.2, 2.0 and 3.5 which are labelled 1\u2212 7 respectively.\nThe intermediate values of \u03c9 = 0.5 and 0.8 are plotted on both panels to link\nthe two together and give the reader a sense of the whole parameter range\nwithout a congested figure. For the small values of \u03c9 in panel (a) we see a\ntypical behaviour emerging. When \u03c9 is moderately small and the flow field\ncontains no islands, such as for lines 3 and 5, we see that Cmax does not grow\nas an inverse power of \u03ba, and in fact when these two results are plotted on a\nlog\u2013linear plot in figure 7 they give approximate straight lines which suggests\n12\na growth of Cmax \u221d \u2212 ln\u03ba. The reason for this growth dependence is not clear,\nand it is not true of all globally chaotic flows. We know this is the case because\nas we reduce \u03c9 further to 0.1 and 0.01, both of which have no resonance islands\nfrom \u00a73, we find that Cmax begins to grow approximately as an inverse power\nof \u03ba. (This can be seen by considering figure 2(b).) In fact the \u03c9 = 0.01 result\n(line 1) can be shown to grow like \u03ba\u22121 plus some smaller correction terms.\nThis analysis is carried out in \u00a74.1. For the cases in panel (a) where there are\nislands, \u03c9 = 0.3 (line 4) and \u03c9 = 0.8 (line 6), we see that for larger \u03ba these\nresults grow much like their non\u2013island counterparts, down to some critical\nvalue of \u03ba where the effect of the islands becomes significant, and then they\nbegin to grow as \u03ba\u2212\u03b1 for some \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1].\nIn the corresponding large \u03c9 figure, figure 6(b), we observe that as \u03c9 increases,\nthe value of the critical \u03ba, where the role of the islands becomes significant,\nmoves to larger \u03ba values until by \u03c9 = 1 (line 4), values of Cmax appear to grow\n\u221d \u03ba\u2212\u03b1 over the whole range of \u03ba considered. The corresponding value of \u03b1\nfor this growth itself increases with \u03c9 until \u03c9 \u2248 3.5 (line 7) where it has the\napproximate value 1. This is because the scalar builds up in the islands and\ngives a scalar distribution of c(x, y) \u2248 1\/(2\u03ba)(cosx\u2212 cos y) as noted in Turner\net al. (2008). The results of \u03c9 = 2.0 and 3.5 (lines 6 and 7) are not computed\nall the way down to \u03ba = 10\u22124 as the other results are, because as \u03c9 becomes\nlarger the number of flow periods that have to be completed before a steady\nstate is achieved increases greatly; however results down to this value of \u03ba are\nnot required to get a clear picture of how the scalar behaves for these values\nof \u03c9. One question still remains: can we link the value of the exponent \u03b1 to\nthe size of the periodic islands?\n 0.8\n 0.85\n 0.9\n 0.95\n 1\n 8  10  12  14  16  18  20\nArea of\nislands\n\u03b1\nFig. 8. Plot of the scaling exponent of Cmax, \u03b1, as a function of the area of the\nperiodic islands in the flow field.\nIn figure 8 we plot the scaling exponent of Cmax, \u03b1, as a function of the area\nof the periodic islands in the flow field. For \u03c9 values between 1.2 and 3.5, we\ncalculate the area of the islands by integrating (3.1) from a regularly spaced\n13\narray of positions in the domain x \u2208 [0, pi], y \u2208 [0, pi] and observing whether\nor not the particle path completes a periodic cycle, i.e. it comes back to its\nstarting position. The area of the islands is then calculated as the fraction of\nperiodic orbits compared to the chaotic orbits scaled up to the whole [\u2212pi, pi]2\ndomain. The corresponding value of \u03b1 on the other hand is calculated by taking\nthe gradient between the values \u03ba = 10\u22123 and 3 \u00d7 10\u22123 in figure 6(b). Both\nthese calculations are prone to numerical error; however test calculations have\nshown that the maximum error for both values is around 3%. Thus figure 8\nshows that by investigating this region of parameter space we find a correlation\nbetween the size of the islands and the scaling exponent \u03b1. It is not clear if the\ncorrelation could be made linear by plotting \u03b1 against another measure of the\nislands such as their circumference, because although the islands are clearly\ndefined in the flow field they are surrounded by regions of weak stretching\nwhich could also be significant to the build up of scalar within the islands.\nThus the calculation of a circumference is difficult. Also if we consider figures\n1(d) and 4(h), we see that the region of scalar build up in figure 4(h) is larger\nthan the physical islands in figure 1(d). The scalar field also has fingers of\nscalar being stretched out which may also be significant in the calculation of\n\u03b1. If this investigation were continued to smaller island areas then we may also\nfind another branch of solutions appearing in figure 8. If this were to happen\nit would show that \u03b1 does not corrolate exactly with the area of the islands,\nbut it could help to understand how \u03b1 scales.\nFrom figure 6(b) we see that Cmax grows like \u03ba\n\u2212\u03b1 in the large \u03c9 limit and\nmoreover that there is a correlation between \u03b1 and the size of the flow islands.\nHowever the exact scaling exponent for small \u03c9 is less clear, and this limit is\nexamined further in the next section by considering a simplified model of the\nflow field.\n4.1 Understanding the small \u03c9 limit: Analysis of the TPSF\nTo understand the scalar distribution in the small \u03c9 limit of the shear flow\n(1.1), we simplify the problem to one that can be analyzed more easily. We\nconsider the flow consisting of two shearing motions where we \u2018switch\u2019 from\none to the other after a given time ts; this is known in the literature as the\ntime\u2013periodic sine flow (TPSF) (Cerbelli et al., 2003; Giona et al., 2004). Thus\nfor one period our flow becomes\nu =\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f3 2 sinx y\u02c6 0 < t \u2264 ts,2 sin y x\u02c6 ts < t \u2264 2ts.\nThis simplified flow takes away the complication of the flow axis varying be-\ntween these two shear flows as in (1.1). The analysis in this section shows\n14\nthat the solution for the scalar field in the initial half of the period is easy\nto examine analytically, while the second half leads to a boundary layer type\nproblem for small \u03ba. Before carrying out an analytical study we first examine\nthe numerical results.\n(a)\n0 1000 2000 3000 4000 500010\n0\n101\n102\n103\nt\nCmax\n1\n2\n3\n4\n(b)\n0 1000 2000 3000 4000 500010\n0\n101\n102\n103\nt\nCmax\nFig. 9. Plot of Cmax(t) for the TPSF. Panel (a) plots this quantity for\n\u03ba = 10\u22121, 10\u22122, 10\u22123 and 10\u22124 labelled 1\u2212 4 respectively, where ts = 2500. Panel\n(b) shows the case \u03ba = 10\u22123 but with ts = 2500 (solid line) and ts = 1500 (dotted\nline).\nFigure 9(a) plots Cmax(t) for the TPSF with ts = 2500 for \u03ba = 10\n\u22121, 10\u22122, 10\u22123\nand 10\u22124 labelled 1\u2212 4 respectively. We observe that over the first half of the\nperiod, Cmax increases to \u03ba\n\u22121, if ts is large enough to allow this. This happens\nbecause for this time the shear flow acts parallel to the injection of scalar\nfrom the source and scalar builds up over this half period until it balances\ndiffusion and c(x, y) = \u03ba\u22121 cosx. However for ts < t < 2ts the shear flow acts\nperpendicular to the source, effectively stretching out the scalar into very fine\nfilaments, which diffusion can then act on and remove. Thus at some point\nCmax reaches a constant value, a steady state; however for smaller values of\n\u03ba the diffusion is weaker and it takes longer for the tracer to cascade to the\nscales at which diffusion balances stretching. Figure 9(b) again plots Cmax in\nthis TPSF for \u03ba = 10\u22123, but with two values of ts. The outcome is that the\nsteady state for ts < t < 2ts is independent of the form of c at t = ts, hence\nwe can analyze this part of the period by considering the steady form of (2.1)\nfor simplicity.\nBy examining the real space plot of the scalar field c(x, y) in the steady state\nfor ts < t < 2ts in figure 10, we can clearly see that as \u03ba is reduced (see panel\n(b) for \u03ba = 10\u22123) the scalar distribution becomes concentrated around y = 0\nand \u00b1pi. This is not as clear for larger values of \u03ba, such as \u03ba = 10\u22121 in panel\n(a), and so to understand how Cmax varies with \u03ba we investigate the limit of\nsmall \u03ba.\n15\n(a)\ny\nx (b)\ny\nx\nFig. 10. Plot of the scalar field for the TPSF for ts < t < 2ts and for (a) \u03ba = 10\u22121\nand (b) \u03ba = 10\u22123. Red (mid grey) corresponds to large positive values of c and\ndark blue (dark grey) corresponds to large negative c. The black line is the contour\nc = 0.\n4.1.1 Steady solution for t \u2264 ts\nFor the first half of the flow period, the steady form of (2.1) simplifies to\n2 sinx\n\u2202c\n\u2202x\n= \u03ba\u22072c+ cosx. (4.1)\nThis equation can easily be solved by seeking a solution for c(x, y) in terms of\nits Fourier components\nc = c1,0e\nix + c1,1e\ni(x+y) + c1,\u22121ei(x\u2212y) + c0,1eiy + ...+ c.c.,\nand then equating the coefficients of each component. Doing this we find that\nc1,0 = 1\/(2\u03ba) and all other coefficients are zero. Thus\nc =\neix\n2\u03ba\n+ c.c. =\ncosx\n\u03ba\n,\nand hence Cmax = \u03ba\n\u22121 for large times, as observed in figure 9(a).\n4.1.2 Steady solution for ts < t < 2ts\nFor the second half of the flow period the steady form of (2.1) takes the similar\nform\n2 sin y\n\u2202c\n\u2202x\n= \u03ba\u22072c+ cosx. (4.2)\nIn this case, as the flow is independent of x we can assume that the scalar is\nharmonic in x with wavenumber 1. Thus for small \u03ba we are seeking a solution\n16\nto (4.1) in the form\nc =\n(\nc0(y, t) + \u03bac1(y, t) +O(\u03ba\n2)\n)\neix + c.c., (4.3)\nwhere we denote c\u02dc = c0(y, t) + \u03bac1(y, t) + O(\u03ba\n2). Substituting this into (4.1)\ngives at O(1),\n2ic0 sin y =\n1\n2\n, (4.4)\nand at O(\u03ba)\n2ic1 sin y =\n(\n\u22022\n\u2202y2\n\u2212 1\n)\nc0. (4.5)\nSolving these two algebraic equations for c0 and c1 gives\nc =\n(\n\u2212 i\n4 sin y\n\u2212 \u03ba cos\n2 y\n2 sin4 y\n)\neix + c.c. .\nHowever this expression has a singularity as y \u2192 0; in fact in this limit the\nabove expression becomes\nc =\n(\n\u2212 i\n4y\n\u2212 \u03ba\n2y4\n)\neix + c.c., (4.6)\nwhich contradicts figure 9 that shows a finite value of Cmax at y = 0. Thus\nusing this knowledge, and figure 10(b), we know that there is a layer about\ny = 0 (or similarly y = \u00b1pi) where the diffusive effects are more important.\nSubstituting (4.3) into (4.2) and expanding about y = 0 leads to the equation\n\u22022c\u02dc\n\u2202y2\n\u2212\n(\n2iy\n\u03ba\n+ \u03ba\n)\nc\u02dc = \u2212 1\n2\u03ba\n.\nWe solve this problem by calculating the Green\u2019s function G(y, s) which sat-\nisfies\n\u22022G\n\u2202y2\n\u2212\n(\n2iy\n\u03ba\n+ \u03ba\n)\nG = \u03b4(y \u2212 s), (4.7)\nwhere \u03b4(X) is the Dirac delta function. The Green\u2019s function must also satisfy\nthe jump conditions\n[G]y=s\n+\ny=s\u2212 = 0, and\n[\n\u2202G\n\u2202y\n]y=s+\ny=s\u2212\n= 1.\nThe Green\u2019s function is calculated by transforming the homogeneous form of\n(4.7) in the Airy equation\n\u22022G\n\u2202Y 2\n\u2212 Y G = 0, (4.8)\n17\nby changing variables to Y = Ay where A3 = 2i\/\u03ba, and neglecting the small\n\u03ba term in the brackets. To have exponential decay for large Y we choose the\nsolution\nG(Y, s) = \u03b1(s)Ai(Y ).\nWe convert this expression back into y\u2212space and we take A = (2\/\u03ba)1\/3eipi\/6\nfor s < y and A = (2\/\u03ba)1\/3e5ipi\/6 for y < s. (The third root gives y purely\nimaginary and is of no significance for this problem). This gives the Green\u2019s\nfunction as\nG =\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f3\u03b1(s)Ai(fy) s < y,\u03b2(s)Ai(e2pii\/3fy) y < s, (4.9)\nwhere f = (2\/\u03ba)1\/3eipi\/6 and \u03b1(s) and \u03b2(s) are arbitrary functions. Solving for\n\u03b1(s) and \u03b2(s) using the jump conditions gives\nG =\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f3\u22122pie\nipi\/6f\u22121Ai(e2pii\/3fs)Ai(fy) s < y,\n\u22122pieipi\/6f\u22121Ai(fs)Ai(e2pii\/3fy) y < s.\n(4.10)\nThus the general solution for c\u02dc(y) is\nc\u02dc(y) = \u2212\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nG(s, y)\n2\u03ba\nds,\nwhich when integrated gives\nc\u02dc =\npi\n(2\u03ba2)1\/3\n(\neipi\/6\u03ba1\/3\n3 \u00b7 21\/3 Ai(fy) + Ai(fy)\n\u222b y\n0\nAi(e2pii\/3fs)ds+ Ai(e2pii\/3fy)\n\u222b \u221e\ny\nAi(fs)ds\n)\n.\n(4.11)\nBy using the asymptotic expressions from pages 448 and 449 of Abramowitz\nand Stegun (1964) the leading order term of the large y expansion of (4.11) is\nc\u02dc \u223c \u2212 i\n4y\n,\nwhich agrees with (4.6). Also from the numerical simulations in this section\nwe know that the maximum value of c occurs at y = 0, so evaluating (4.11)\nat y = 0 gives\nc = 2c\u02dc cosx, c\u02dc =\npiAi(0)\n31\/222\/3\u03ba1\/3\n,\nand\nCmax \u223c 0.811\u03ba\u22121\/3. (4.12)\nThis asymptotic value of Cmax (dashed line) is plotted with the value obtained\nfrom the full numerical simulation (solid line) in figure 11. Note that the\nagreement is excellent for small \u03ba.\n18\n 1\n 10\n10-4 10-3 10-2 10-1\n\u03ba\nmaxC\nFig. 11. Plot of Cmax(\u03ba) for the TPSF (ts < t < 2ts), with the simulation results as\nthe solid line and the asymptotic result (4.12) as the dashed line.\nLinking this result back to the \u03c9 = 0.01 result (line 1) of figure 6(a) shows that\nas \u03c9 \u2192 0 then Cmax \u223c 12(\u03ba\u22121 + 0.811\u03ba\u22121\/3 + o(\u03ba\u22121\/3)), which when compared\nto the \u03c9 = 0.01 result shows reasonable agreement. The agreement would\nimprove as \u03c9 is reduced further, but gaining this result numerically is beyond\nthe parameter range that we can easily compute.\n4.2 Effective diffusion\nA useful diagnostic for examining scalar fields is the effective diffusion of the\nscalar field (Nakamura, 1996; Winters and D\u2019Asaro, 1996; Shuckburgh and\nHaynes, 2003; Turner et al., 2008). This diagnostic has the useful property\nthat it is large in regions where the scalar field is well mixed, and low in\nregions of poorly mixed scalar (Nakamura (1996); Shuckburgh and Haynes\n(2003)), thus in this section we shall apply it to scalar fields from flows with\nand without islands to try to understand how the scalar mixes in these flows.\nThe time evolution of the scalar in the transformed isotracer coordinates is de-\ntermined as a function of area in two dimensions (Nakamura, 1996) or volume\nin three dimensions (Winters and D\u2019Asaro, 1996). For the two\u2013dimensional\ncase we define the area of a contour C as the region bounded by this contour,\ni.e. everywhere where c(x, t) \u2264 C. Thus we write\nA =\n\u222b \u222b\nH(C \u2212 c(x, t)) dA, (4.13)\nwhere H(X) is the Heaviside function. Under this change of coordinates (2.1)\n19\nbecomes\n\u2202C\n\u2202t\n=\n\u2202\n\u2202A\n(\nKeff(A, t)\n\u2202C\n\u2202A\n)\n+ \u3008S\u3009A, (4.14)\nwhere the effective diffusion can be written as\nKeff =\n\u2202A\n\u2202C\n\u222b\n\u03b3(C,t)\n\u03ba|\u2207c| ds = \u3008\u03ba|\u2207c|\n2\u3009A\n(\u2202C\/\u2202A)2\n. (4.15)\nThe contour \u03b3(C, t) bounds the region A at a time t, and the weighted contour\naverage of a quantity \u03c7 is given by\n\u3008\u03c7\u3009A = \u2202\n\u2202A\n\u222b\nc\u2264C(A,t)\n\u03c7dA =\n(\u222b\n\u03b3\nds\n|\u2207c|\n)\u22121 \u222b\n\u03b3\n\u03c7\nds\n|\u2207c| .\nIn this study we calculate the effective diffusion of a particular scalar contour\nC using both forms of (4.15) and this then acts as a check on the resolution\nof our code. For more information on the numerical evaluation of the second\nmethod in (4.15) see Shuckburgh and Haynes (2003) or Turner et al. (2008).\nIn this section we consider the time\u2013averaged form of Keff to give a view\nof how the scalar is mixed over one period of the flow. Thus we define the\ntime\u2013averaged effective diffusion as\nK\u0302eff = Keff\n\u2202C\n\u2202A\n\/\n\u2202C\n\u2202A\n. (4.16)\nPrevious studies have shown that areas of large effective diffusion correspond\nto regions of the flow where the scalar is well mixed (Nakamura, 1996; Shuck-\nburgh and Haynes, 2003; Turner et al., 2008). Thus we consider how the\ntime\u2013averaged effective diffusion may look for two flow fields, one with is-\nlands (\u03c9 = 1) and one without (\u03c9 = 0.5). These effective diffusions K\u0302eff\nare plotted for \u03c9 = 0.5 in figure 12(a) and \u03c9 = 1 for figure 12(b) both for\n\u03ba = 10\u22121, 10\u22122, 10\u22123 and 10\u22124 labelled 1 to 4 respectively. In figure 12 we\nplot K\u0302eff as a function of A, thus A = 0 corresponds to C = \u2212Cmax, A = 4pi2\ncorresponds to C = Cmax and A = 2pi\n2 at C = 0.\nOne clear distinction to note from the two panels in figure 12 is that K\u0302eff(A) for\n\u03c9 = 0.5 has a much wider profile than for \u03c9 = 1, i.e. that K\u0302eff > 1\/2 max(K\u0302eff)\nover a much larger range of area values for \u03c9 = 0.5. For \u03ba > 10\u22122, K\u0302eff is larger\nfor most values of A for \u03c9 = 0.5, showing that a globally chaotic flow mixes\nscalar better than a flow with islands (\u03c9 = 1). However as \u03ba is reduced to 10\u22124\n(line 4 in figure 12) we see that although K\u0302eff has a larger value (suggesting\nthat the scalar is generally better mixed) over most of the domain for \u03c9 = 0.5,\nthere is a region around A = 2pi2 for \u03c9 = 1 where K\u0302eff is larger, suggesting\nthat the chaotic band seen in figures 4(g) and 4(h) contains scalar which is\n20\n(a)\n0 10 20 300\n10\n20\n30\n40\nA\nK eff\n^\n12\n43\n(b)\n0 10 20 300\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\nA\neffK\n^\n1\n24 3\nFig. 12.

Another point to\nnote is that for \u03c9 = 0.5, there is a clear difference between the \u03ba = 10\u22123 (line\n3) and the \u03ba = 10\u22124 (line 4) results, while for \u03c9 = 1 these two results are\nmuch more similar. This suggests that if K\u0302eff has an inviscid limit (\u03ba \u2192 0)\nthen the presence of islands may cause this limit to be obtained for a larger\nvalue of \u03ba.\nTurner et al. (2008) calculate results for K\u0302eff for \u03ba = 10\n\u22122, 10\u22123 and 10\u22124\nusing an Eulerian code. The restrictions using this code mean that steady\nstates were hard to reach as they require very long time integrations, and in\nfact the results for \u03ba = 10\u22123 and 10\u22124 (along with 10\u22125 and 10\u22126) in figure 13\nof Turner et al. (2008) are not at a steady state, as speculated in the previous\npaper. However the semi\u2013Lagrangian code in the current paper allows us to\nintegrate for long time periods, so we can be sure that the results in figure\n12(b) really are steady. Thus for these steady results we note that K\u0302eff for\n10\u22123 and 10\u22124 are fairly similar; however we would still need to examine much\nsmaller values of \u03ba to fully determine whether or not an inviscid limit for K\u0302eff\nactually exists, and this question is left for future research.\n5 Conclusions and discussion\nIn this paper we studied the behaviour of a scalar field in a velocity field\nwith a steady source of scalar. The velocity field takes the form of a shear\nflow which changes from being approximately parallel to the y\u2212axis to being\napproximately parallel to the x\u2212axis periodically with period T = pi\/\u03c9. The\nparameter \u03c9 can be varied and the flow field changes from configurations\nwhere the Poincare\u00b4 section is globally chaotic to situations where it has islands\n21\nsurrounded by a chaotic sea. As \u03c9 is decreased the globally chaotic and island\ncases alternate at the rate 1\/\u03c9 due to a resonance effect of the flow field.\nThroughout this work we have concentrated on the large time form of the\nscalar when it is in a periodic state and we can sensibly define a time average\nfor the scalar diagnostics over each period of the flow.\nThe results show that the time\u2013averaged lengths of scalar contours in the\nchaotic region approximately increase as \u03ba\u22121\/2 for both flows with islands\nand without; however the time\u2013averaged maximum value of the scalar, Cmax,\ndepends more strongly on the size of the flow islands with larger islands giving\na larger value of Cmax. The flow field in (1.1) is not typical of an atmospheric\nflow, however this result is still of interest to those investigating the build up\nof pollutants in the atmosphere or other fluid flows. For large values of \u03c9, the\nscalar field and flow field has an almost cellular structure, and Cmax \u223c \u03ba\u22121,\nwhile as \u03c9 is decreased Cmax \u223c \u03ba\u2212\u03b1 where \u03b1 decreases from 1 and there is a\ncorrelation between \u03b1 and the area of the flow islands. This algebraic growth,\nas opposed to the \u2212 ln\u03ba type growth seen in the simulations, also begins to\noccur for smaller values of \u03ba as \u03c9 is reduced. At \u03c9 \u2248 0.75 the periodic islands\ndisappear and at this point Cmax appears to increase like \u2212 ln\u03ba. Thus the\npresence of the islands in the flow affects the scalar field by inhibiting mixing\nand allowing scalar concentrations to build up.\nFor small values of \u03c9 where the flow field exhibits a resonance effect, Cmax\nagain appears to grow like \u03ba\u2212\u03b1 for an exponent \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1), but on careful\nexamination it actually grows as \u03ba\u2212\u03b1 plus a small correction term. For the\ncase of very small \u03c9 we calculate this correction term by considering the time\u2013\nperiodic sine flow which acts parallel to the y\u2212axis for a fixed amount of time\nbefore switching to acting parallel to the x\u2212axis. In this flow field the scalar\nbuilds up over the first period of the flow and then is sheared perpendicular\nto the source for the second half of the period. For this flow the scalar rose to\nthe constant value Cmax = \u03ba\n\u22121 over the first half the period and then reduced\nto another constant value for the second half of the flow. In this half, for small\n\u03ba, the scalar becomes concentrated at y = 0 in a thin boundary layer, and the\nsolution to this problem is found using matched asymptotic expansions to be\nCmax = 0.811\u03ba\n\u22121\/3. This means that as \u03c9 \u2192 0, Cmax \u2192 12(\u03ba\u22121 + 0.811\u03ba\u22121\/3).\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors would like to thank Professor Peter Ashwin for his useful dis-\ncussions in the writing of this paper.
