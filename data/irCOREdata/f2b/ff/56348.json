There is no evidence of significant modification by subsequent \nburial, igneous events, reheating or mineralization. Low values of CAI 2-2.5 on the Ashnott High \nare interpreted to be due to the thinner sedimentary cover in that area and possible insulation \nderived from underlying Waulsortian limestones. Relatively high values of CAI 4 (Dinantian) in \nthe Holme Chapel Borehole and 3.5 in the Silesian sediments to the south of the Craven Basin, \nprobably reflect a thicker Westphalian cover than further north. \n \n 2\n1. INTRODUCTION \n \nConodonts, an extinct group of Palaeozoic-Triassic elongate marine chordates (e.g. Sweet & \nDonoghue, 2001), were soft-bodied animals, except for small phosphatic tooth-like elements that \nformed the feeding apparatus. The hard phosphatic elements of conodonts are generally found \nscattered in marine sedimentary rocks of Cambrian to Triassic age and have immense \nbiostratigraphical utility.  Preservation of soft body parts is rare and the first unequivocal soft \nbodied conodont was only described in 1983 (Briggs et al., 1983). The phosphatic elements of \nconodonts contain some organic material and when the elements are heated in the subsurface, \nthey progressively and irreversibly change colour with increased temperature and time (Fig. 1, \nTable 1). In addition, as conodonts are heated, or subject to matamorphism, their microstructure \nis altered texturally and at very high temperatures and pressures, the conodont elements may be \nrecrystallized, or become pitted, distorted and eventually destroyed. Studies of conodont colour \nand textural alteration have led to the establishment of a scale of Conodont Colour Alteration \nIndices (CAIs) and textural alteration types (Epstein et al., 1977; Rejebian et al., 1987). The \nprogressive change in conodont colour has been used extensively in the petroleum industry as an \nindex of thermal maturation, but has also been used to indicate temperatures of mineralization \n(Rejebian et al., 1987; Jones, 1992). Conodont colour and levels and type of textural alteration \ncan also be used in regional basin history and tectonic studies (e.g. Metcalfe, 2003). We here \npresent CAI data for the Carboniferous of the Craven Basin that has implications for sedimentary \nburial histories, basin evolution, hydrocarbon exploration and mineralisation. The study area \nincludes the Craven Basin of Hudson (1933), equivalent to the Bowland Basin of Ramsbottom \n(1974), and adjacent Silesian outcrops to the south. \n \n 3\nTABLE 1 HERE \n \n CAI values reported in this study come from published biostratigraphical collections \n(Austin, 1968; Higgins, 1975; Metcalfe, 1980, 1981; Metcalfe & Leeder, 1979; Riley et al. 1987: \nTurner et al., 1979) and unpublished material held at the British Geological Survey, the \nUniversity of New England, Armidale, Australia and Trinity College Dublin (see Appendix for \nlisting and grid localities). The emphasis on Dinantian (Mississippian) CAI values is a \nconsequence of the nature of these collections. Before discussion of the CAI values in the region \nit is necessary to give a general outline of the Carboniferous succession, in particular that of the \nDinantian, and the subsequent burial history.  \n \n2. POST DEVONIAN TECTONICS AND SEDIMENTATION \n \nA sketch map showing the principal anticlines that expose Dinantian rocks in the Craven Basin \nand a sketch map of the principal basement structures which affected Carboniferous deposition \nare given in Fig. 2. The Craven Basin is a Dinantian depositional and structural basin trending \nsouth-west. Like many contemporaneous basins in northern Britain, it is believed to have formed \nunder an extensional tectonic regime produced by lithospheric stretching, possibly initiated \nduring the late Devonian (Leeder, 1982; Gawthorpe, 1987), which may have been punctuated by \na period of transpression in Visean and early Namurian times (Arthurton 1983, 1984; Arthurton \net al. 1988). This tectonic regime resulted in basement rift faulting and the formation of an \nasymetric graben, with a southward tilting floor, bounded by shallow basement comprising the \nSouthern Lake District High and Askrigg Block to the north and the Central Lancashire High to \nthe south (Miller & Grayson, 1982). The western and eastern boundaries of the basin are unclear, \n 4\nsince exposure is lost beneath Permo-Triassic cover but it extends towards Formby. Various \nmodels for the basement configuration in the region have been given by Miller & Grayson \n(1982), Gawthorpe (1987), Lawrence et al. (1987), Arthurton et al. (1988), Lee, (1988), Leeder \n& McMahon (1988) and Gawthorpe et al. (1989). The regional depositional history of the \nDinantian has been described in detail by Gawthorpe (1966, 1987) and Riley (1990).  \n \n The Dinantian succession which overlies the shallow basement at the basin margins \ncomprises locally an initial sequence of red beds, marine peritidal limestones and evaporites \n(Stockdale Farm Formation of Arthurton et al. 1988), overlain by more widespread, shallow-\nwater marine shelf and platform carbonates. These sequences contrast strongly with the Craven \nBasin, in which the sequence is much thicker, more complete and varied. Geophysical (gravity) \nevidence (Cornwell & Evans in Arthurton et al. 1988) suggests that at least 3 km of unexposed \nsediment overlie the basement in the Craven Basin and a further 3 km is known to have \naccumulated from mid-Courceyan to late Brigantian times (Charsley 1984; Kirby et al. 2000, \nMap 4). The earliest exposed strata comprise the Chatburn Limestone Group and consist of \nimpure shallow water marine limestones and fine-grained terriginous clastics. These sediments \nwere rapidly deposited and there was little bathymetric variation across the basin. During \nChadian times (Clitheroe Limestone Formation) the effects of basement rifting became more \npronounced. This resulted in a varied basin floor topography with a reduction in the deposition of \nshallow marine limestones that were generally replaced by deeper water Waulsortian limestones. \nWidespread erosion occurred within the basin during the late Chadian, but by Arundian times the \nbasin was dominated by pelagic mudstone and limestone turbidite deposition (Hodder Mudstone, \nHodderense Limestone, Pendleside Limestone, and Bowland Shale formations). Intrabasinal \ntopography was maintained by syndepositional movement along basement fractures in the graben \n 5\nfloor.  \n \nDuring early Namurian times, the southern boundary of the basin became less distinct in \nterms of facies and sediment thickness. Subsidence extended to areas of basement, such as the \nCentral Lancashire High, which had previously been stable relative to the basin. This regional \nsubsidence, attributed to thermal subsidence by Leeder (1982), resulted in the accumulation of at \nleast 1.75 km of Namurian mudstones and sandstones exposed in the Rossendale Anticline which \noverlies the Central Lancashire High (Ramsbottom et al. 1978). General Namurian cover across \nthe study area was probably in the order of 1.5 km, with south-eastwards transfer of a depocentre \nresulting in a thick early Namurian sequence in the north-west of the region and a thick late \nNamurian sequence in the south-east (Kirby et al. 2000). Much of the Westphalian is no longer \npreserved in the study area, however the South Lancashire Coalfield comprises at least 1.84 km \nof sandstone, siltstone and mudstone-dominated strata (Ramsbottom et al. 1978). Since early \nWestphalian strata preserved in the Burnley Syncline and Ingleton-Austwick coalfields are \nthinner than the contemporary strata in southern and western parts of the Lancashire Coalfield, it \nis assumed that a Westphalian cover over the area was in the order of 1.5 km, resulting in an \nestimated general burial of the top Dinantian by approximately 3 km of Silesian sediments (Kirby \net al. 2000).  \n \nToward the close of the Carboniferous, compressional tectonics replaced thermal \nsubsidence. This resulted in Hercynian reactivation of the Lower Palaeozoic basement structures, \nsuch as the Central Lancashire High and the Craven Basin resulting in the formation of the \nRossendale Anticline and Ribblesdale Fold Belt respectively (Leeder 1982; Kirby et al. 2000).  \n \n 6\n During the Permo-Triassic, sedimentation resumed upon the eroded Hercynian structures. \nRemnants of this cover remain in faulted outliers around Clitheroe and Ingleton, suggesting post-\nTriassic fault activity in the region. It is unclear how much Permo-Triassic sediment \naccumulated, but Jackson et al. (1987) gave a total thickness of around 5 km of Permo-Triassic \nsediments in the East Irish Sea Basin, which lies offshore to the west of the study area. However, \nthe CAI values which we have observed suggest that post-Carboniferous burial in the study area \nwas much less than 5 km and generally less than 1 km (Kirby et al. 2000) and was insufficient to \naffect the CAI values already achieved during the Carboniferous.  \n \nCenozoic tectonic activity can be deduced from the intrusion of two igneous dykes, one in \nthe Grindleton Anticline [SD 7540 4710] and the other in the Lancaster Fells at Caton Moor [SD \n5632 6302] (Thompson. Green (1986) considered from fission track analysis, that the Lake \nDistrict to the north of the study area had undergone between 1 and 4 km of uplift since the \nPalaeogene. In the Craven Basin, Moseley (1972) suggested that uplift was greatest along-the \nAskrigg Block and decreased south-westwards. Evidence for Neogene uplift can also be inferred \nfrom Walsh et al. (1972) who correlated Neogene weathering with a 450 m altitude topographic \nbench present in the Pennines (Sissons, 1954). It would appear, therefore, that during the \nCenozoic, the study area was uplifted and eroded with renewed tectonic activity along certain \ninherited fractures, in rare cases associated with limited igneous intrusion.  \n \n3. THE CAI PATTERN \n \nCAI values are plotted on Fig. 3. Some localities that are very close to each other have been \ncombined as single plots. The precise location, stratigraphic horizon and lithology for each value \n 7\nis given in the Appendix. Apart from the Holme Chapel Borehole [SD 8608 2878] all the samples \nare from surface sections or shallow boreholes.  \n \n There is generally little variation in the CAI values across the area, with a range of \nbetween 2 and 3.5, apart from a single exceptional value of CAI 4 recorded in the Holme Chapel \nBorehole. The higher values generally occur in the south and south-west and low values are \nfound on the Ashnott High (Ashnott Anticline and eastern closure of the Whitewell Anticline) \nand in Waulsortian limestones. Because of the generally consistent CAI values and the lack of a \ncomprehensive geographical coverage, no attempt is made to draw CAI isograds. The values \nobserved are in broad agreement with expected values for the Carboniferous indicated by \nregional studies to the north (Burnett, 1987; Armstrong & Purnell, 1993).  \n \n4. INTERPRETATION OF THE CAI PATTERN \n \n4.1. Facies effect \n \nThe effect of facies on CAI values has already been demonstrated by Mayr et al. (1978), and it \nappears that conodonts from black shales can show CAI values one unit higher than in those from \nlimestones. Almost all the conodonts used in this study come from limestones (mainly \npackstones), and Silesian samples were obtained mainly from wackestone nodules (\"bullions\"). \nIn general, there is a variation of about half a CAI unit value within samples at any given locality, \nexcept for Waulsortian limestone facies where there is a variation of one CAI value. For example, \nin the Clitheroe area the Waulsortian limestones of the Clitheroe Limestone Formation show a \nCAI value of 2.5 whereas crinoidal limestones in the overlying Hodder Mudstone Formation \n 8\nyield conodonts with CAI values of 3.0 to 3.5. This variation may be due to a number of possible \ncauses, including (a) the type and amount of organic matter incorporated into the conodont \nelements by the animals living in these different environments, (b) differences in conodont \nelement growth rates, (c) differences in thermal conductivity of the various limestones and \nadjacent strata, (d) differential effects of migrating fluids due to variations in porosity and \npermeability in the different facies, and (e) early cementation of the Waulsortian limestones \n(Miller & Lees, 1985).  \n \n4.2. Burial and uplift \n \nAs already noted the top Dinantian was probably buried by approximately 3 km of Silesian \nsediments. Most of the observations in this study are of mid-Dinantian sediments, generally \naround 0.8 km below the top of the Dinantian succession. Since the present tectonic pattern was \nestablished by Permo-Triassic times, the burial time for the late Dinantian would be \napproximately 30 million years. Most of the CAI values in the Craven Basin range between 2.5 \nand 3.5 and are most commonly 3.0. Epstein et al. (1977) suggest a minimum temperature of \n110oC to ~190oC for a CAI value of 3. However, with a burial time of 30 million years this CAI \nvalue indicates temperatures of near 125oC (Epstein et al. 1977). Since most of the samples are \nfrom the mid-Dinantian, heating time may have been a little longer, suggesting temperatures in \nthe region of 110-120oC for the Dinantian. Given an assumed geothermal gradient of 30oC\/km \n(typical for extensional basins), the Craven area CAI values are not in general anomalously high \nand are consistent with their burial-uplift history.  \n \n The relatively high CAI value of 4 recorded from Dinantian limestones at a depth of 5875 \n 9\nft (1790.7 m) in the Holme Chapel Borehole, and CAI values of 3.5 in Namurian and early \nWestphalian sediments south of the Craven Basin, are probably a result of increased Westphalian \ncover (now removed) compared to further north. The lower CAI values of 2-2.5 seen over the \nAshnott High are probably due to a combination of both relatively lower depth of burial, since \nthis site accumulated a condensed sequence from mid-Dinantian until early Namurian times, and \nthe proximity of thick Waulsortian limestones, which as already noted possibly inhibited thermal \nconduction.  \n \n4.3. Basin tectonics \n \nWe consider the development of the Craven Basin to follow the model of McKenzie (1978), \ninvolving lithospheric thinning due to extension followed by thermal subsidence. Observed CAI \nvalues agree moderately well with McKenzie\u2019s (1981) computation of temperatures within a \nsediment pile following extension. McKenzie (1981) concluded that maximum temperatures for \nshallow burial at less than 4km were attained much later than the onset of subsidence. For a \nstretching factor (\uf062) of 2, applied by Dewey (1982), to the Silesian sequence in this region, and 3 \nkm of burial, a maximum temperature of 150oC at top Dinantian would be attained after 45 \nmillion years. Clearly the Hercynian uplift and folding which occured some 20 million years after \nthe onset of thermal subsidence (Leeder, 1988), prevented the maximum temperatures from being \nachieved. It appears, therefore, that McKenzie's (1981) modeled temperatures can be applied in a \ntruncated form to the regional CAI values.  \n \n4.4. Igneous rocks \n 10\n \nThe only igneous rocks recorded in the area comprise two Tertiary olivine-basalt dykes, located \nin the Grindleton Anticline and at Caton Moor respectively (Eccles,1870). Conodont samples are \nnot yet available from these sites and the local CAI value of 3-3.5 is likely to be exceeded only \nwithin a few metres of these intrusions, when compared to other examples outside the study area \n(Armstrong & Strens, 1987). The regional CAI values do not appear to have been modified by \nigneous activity.  \n \n4.5. Mineralization and fluid processes \n \nMineralization in the area is of lead-zinc-copper type with associated baryte and fluorite. CAI \nvalues in mineralized areas for example at Raygill, [SD 9400 4520] (CAI value of 3.0) Skeleron \n[SD 8140 4520] (CAI value of 3.0), and Ashnott [SD 6970 4860] (CAI values of 2.0-2.5) are \nwithin the regional range and do not appear to be affected by the mineralization. This is as \nexpected, since fluid inclusion studies indicate mineralization temperatures of between 104oC and \n138oC (Rogers, 1977), which are too low to have increased the CAI values already attained.  \n \n Evidence of late Carboniferous diagenesis by dolomitizing fluids is provided by the \nrecognition of remagnetization of late Dinantian limestones (Pendleside Limestone Formation) \non the Pendle Monocline (Addison et al. 1985) and around Skipton (Turner et al. 1979). It is \nunclear whether these fluids have had any influence on the CAI values.  \n \n The relatively high present day heat flows of over 8OmWm-2 observed in the Bowland \nFells (Lee et al., 1987) cannot be explained by underlying granite (as in the Askrigg and Alston \n 11\nBlocks). These values are probably caused by circulating groundwater (Downing et al., 1987), \nwhich relates either to a Carboniferous aquifer or a localised concentration of fracturing.  \n \n5. OTHER SOURCES OF MATURITY DATA AND CORRELATION WITH CAI \nVALUES \n \nPublished information on independent maturity data in the study area is sparse and is largely \nlimited to vitrinite reflectance. Shelley's (1967) volatile matter and fixed carbon data, from coal \nseams in the Great Scar Limestone north of the Ingleton Coalfield, suggests a vitrinite reflectance \nof approximately 1.2% Ro. This corresponds to a CAI value of 2. This is broadly consistent with \nCAI data reported here. Similar data reported by Shelley (1967) from the Ingleton coalfield \nsuggests a vitrinite reflectance of approximately 0.5% Ro corresponding to a CAI of 1. Trotter \n(1954) reported volatile matter and other data that represent vitrinite reflectance values of 1.25-\n1.35% Ro from the Westphalian of the Burnley Syncline, equivalent to CAI 2. Lawrence et al. \n(1987) reported values of 0.7-1.09% Ro (= CAI 2) from Namurian strata at Abbeystead (SD 5700 \n6400) in the Bowland Fells, 0.7-0.99% Ro (= CAI 2) from subcropping Dinantian\/ lower \nNamurian (Pendleian) strata at Sykes [SD 6250 5200] and two values of 0.91% Ro (= CAI 2) and \n1.46% Ro (= CAI 3) from the Whitmoor Borehole [SD 5874 6315], from the lower Namurian \n(Pendleian), and the late Dinantian (Asbian) Pendleside Limestone, at 865 ft (263.65 m) and \n3830 ft (1167.38 m) respectively. These vitrinite reflectance data are generally in agreement with \nthe observed CAI values in the Bowland - Lancaster Fells, when allowance is made for the fact \nthat the CAI values are slightly increased by the facies effect produced by the black shale nodular \nlimestones from which the values were obtained.  \n \n 12\n6. HYDROCARBON-OCCURENCE \n \nThe observed CAI values correspond to a range from the base of the oil window into the \ncondensate\/dry gas sectors of Heroux et al. (1979). Hydrocarbon shows are reported from a \nnumber of localites in the area, but these tend to be minor and of no commercial value. Most of \nthe shows are of oil or gas associated with past coal mining, for instance oil at Huncoat Colliery \nnear Blackburn and from pits around Burnley (Strahan, 1920), and gas at Birstall Smitheries near \nHuddersfield (Wray et al. 1930) and in the Bradford area (Stephens et al. 1953). Oil seeps have \nalso been reported at surface in the Formby area (Wray & Wolverson Cope 1948) where there is \nalso a small oilfield (Falcon and Kent, 1960). Here the reservoir is Triassic strata, but it is \ngenerally thought that the source is Carboniferous. Stephens et al. (1953) reported oil in \nNamurian bullions at Moor Houses, near Skipton. As already noted, biogenic methane was \nresponsible for the underground pipeline explosion at Abbeystead in 1984. Solid bitumen veinlets \nare known from the Haw Bank Limestone (Courceyan), which forms the core of the Skipton \nAnticline (Lees & Cox 1937). In addition visual observation by NJR shows liquid hydrocarbons \n(light oil) to be common on vein surfaces and in vughs in bullions from black shales. In the \nAshnott and Cow Ark anticlines, liquid hydrocarbons and pyrobitumen, within cavities and \nfractures associated with mineralization, have also been noted in boreholes penetrating \nWaulsortian limestones.  \n \n7. CONCLUSIONS \n \nCAI values in the Craven area show a general range of 2.5-3.5, the majority being a value of 3. \nThese values are consistent with the limited vitrinite reflectance data and are a result of the \n 13\nCarboniferous sedimentary and tectonic history of the region. There is no evidence of significant \nmodification by subsequent burial, igneous events, reheating or mineralization. Low values of \nCAI 2-2.5 on the Ashnott High are interpreted to be due to the thinner sedimentary cover in that \narea and possible insulation derived from underlying Waulsortian limestones. Relatively high \nvalues of CAI 4 (Dinantian) in the Holme Chapel Borehole and 3.5 in the Silesian sediments to \nthe south of the Craven Basin, probably reflect a thicker Westphalian cover than further north. \nObserved CAI values in the Craven Basin can therefore be explained as entirely due to depth of \nburial and pre-dates Permian extension. \n \nAPPENDIX \n \nThe following sample localities used in this study are listed below in ascending lithostratigraphic \norder, together with their national grid reference, the range of CAI values observed and \nchronostratigraphic division(s). In cases where a spread of values was observed at one locality, \nonly the dominant value was plotted on Fig. 3. Repositories are referred to in brackets at the end \nof each entry.
