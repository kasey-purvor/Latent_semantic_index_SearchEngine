Whilst good combustion depends only in part\non the characteristics of the flow within the combustion chamber, good engine\nbreathing is strongly affected by the unsteady flow in the intake manifold, and to a\nlesser extent, that in the exhaust manifold.\nThere has been much research on calculating the effects of unsteady flow in intake\nand exhaust manifolds. Reference [1] provides a good summary of the history of the\ntopic over the last several decades. History tells us that correctly harnessing the\nunsteady flow in the intake manifold of a naturally aspirated I.C. engine can yield\nimprovements in engine torque of 10% or more, whereas performing the equivalent in\nthe exhaust manifold is yields a more modest 3-5%.\nPrevious studies of unsteady flows in I.C. engine manifolds have mostly used one-\ndimensional gas-dynamic theory. Reference [2] is a well-known text where the\nMethod of Characteristics is used to solve the one dimensional, non-linear, gas-\ndynamic equations in space and time. Reference [3] is a more recent alternative.\nWhen the amplitude of the unsteady component of pressure in a manifold is\nsufficiently low, the propagation of such a disturbance is well described by linear\nHarrison, Stanev Model for intake wave dynamics: revision 1\n3\nacoustic theory [4]. Under such conditions, the tuning of manifold geometry to\nimprove engine performance becomes an exercise in applied acoustics. There is recent\nevidence to support the use of linear acoustic theory at sound pressure levels in excess\nof 165 dB [5].\nThe work presented here is restricted to the intake system only. Although the unsteady\nflow in the exhaust manifold is of interest to engine developers and exhaust silencer\nmanufacturers alike, the high sound intensity levels in the pipes suggests the use a\nnon-linear gas-dynamic approach rather than an acoustic such as this one. When\ncarefully interrogated, the results of non-linear gas-dynamic calculations can reveal\nsecrets of the unsteady exhaust flow that cannot be readily measured. For example,\nreference [6] shows a calculation of the unsteady flow velocity through an exhaust\nvalve.\nThe linear acoustic model developed in this work offers an alternative to non-linear\ngas-dynamic calculations and has proved realistic for the unsteady flow in the intake\nmanifold of a naturally aspirated I.C. engine. Because it views the problem of intake\nflow as one of applied acoustics, it is hoped that the model promotes a different\nperspective on what is otherwise a well-studied system. The authors are not claiming\nthat this method is particularly unique, but it does have the useful attribute of being\nvery simple and yet proving realistic in practice\nThe complex nature of intake flows has made their understanding a difficult task,\nhence the long history of research on the problem. The complexity arises for several\nreasons:\nHarrison, Stanev Model for intake wave dynamics: revision 1\n4\n(i) The intake flow is unsteady. The flow velocity over the back of the intake\nvalves may reach 300+ m\/s for short periods of the intake stroke but once the\nvalve closes it is strictly zero.\n(ii) The flow through the valve is coupled to the wave dynamics in the port. High\nrates of unsteady flow cause intense wave action. When sufficiently intense\nthese waves can influence the unsteady flow. Hence, the unsteady flow is both\na cause and a result of wave action.\n(iii) When sufficiently intense, the wave action may exhibit non-linear behaviour.\n(iv) There are many points in an intake system where wave energy may be\nreflected. A complex sound field results from the sum of many reflections.\n(v) For the case of multi-cylinder engines, waves caused in separate ports may\npropagate and interfere with one another.\n(vi) The flow may cause secondary sources of flow noise. Such flow noise is\nparticularly excited by the expansion chambers [7] and orifices [8] commonly\nfound in intake systems. The understanding of the flow noise problem is under\ncontinuous development.\nThe first five complexities may be accommodated within a non-linear, time marching\niterative model of the wave action. Such models calculate time histories for the\nunsteady pressure velocity, density and temperature in the intake system. Together,\nHarrison, Stanev Model for intake wave dynamics: revision 1\n5\nthese describe the intake process and their scrutiny is therefore worthwhile. However,\nthe causes of these fluctuations remain mysterious, concealed in the iterative numerics\nrequired for their calculation.\nA simpler model is sought to explain the causes of fluctuating pressure and velocity in\nthe intake port. The model presented here makes the following assumptions with\nrespect to the six complexities described above:\n(i) Only two flow states are considered. When the intake valve is open a single\ntime-average flow velocity is calculated for that open period. When the valve\nis closed, the net flow velocity is taken to be zero.\n(ii) A simplified model of the intake process is obtained where the unsteady flow\nthrough the valve and the wave action in the port are un-coupled. The\nunsteady flow causes the wave action but the wave action is not allowed to\ninfluence the unsteady flow.\n(iii) Linear, plane wave acoustic theory is used to calculate the wave action thus\nneglecting any non-linear effects.\n(iv) A simple straight pipe intake system is used to minimise the number of\nlocations at which sound is reflected.\n(v) A single cylinder engine is considered in order to remove interactions in the\nwaves caused by different cylinders.\nHarrison, Stanev Model for intake wave dynamics: revision 1\n6\n(vi) The influence of flow induced noise is neglected.\n2 The test case\nThe model described here has been developed alongside a set of measurements made\non a Ricardo E6 single cylinder research engine. The 0.5 litre engine was fitted with a\nrather long intake pipe (1.4 m) and a fixed venturi carburettor 400mm from the intake\nvalve, as shown in Figure 1. A large airbox fitted with an orifice plate was used to\nmeasure air consumption rates. A previous study had confirmed that the pressure of\nthe airbox had negligible effect on the wave action in the intake pipe [9]. Kistler\nType 4045A2 pressure sensors were fitted in the intake port and elsewhere in the\nintake pipe. A slotted disk fitted to the end of the crankshaft and an optical sensor\ngave an indication of instantaneous crankshaft position. The engine was run and also\nmotored at various speeds in the range 1000-2000 rev\/min-1 and the signals from the\npressure and optical sensors were digitised using an Iotech Daqbook200 system.\n3 The physics of the intake process\nFigure 2 shows a sketch of the intake process. During the intake stroke, an annulus of\nturbulent flow develops over the back of the opening valve and is eliminated when the\nvalve shuts once more. The magnitude and direction of the flow is dictated by the\nratio of unsteady pressures either side of the valve. A favourable pressure ratio for\ninflow to the cylinder occurs when the pressure in the cylinder is lower than the\npressure in the port. Such a favourable pressure ratio may be obtained in two ways:\nfirstly, by the rapid downward motion of the piston reducing the cylinder pressure and\nHarrison, Stanev Model for intake wave dynamics: revision 1\n7\nsecondly, by the wave action in the port increasing the instantaneous pressure in the\nport.\nEvidence of these two mechanisms may be found in measured traces of the\nfluctuating pressure in the port. Figure 3 shows the port pressure for one engine\ncycle, both with the engine run and motored at around 1900 rev\/min-1 Note that the\nspeeds shown in Figure: 3 and subsequent figures are slightly different in both cases.\nThe speeds quoted are those calculated for the particular cycle for which data is\ndisplayed. When firing, the engine speed varies from cycle to cycle, whereas the\nvariation is minimal when the engine is motored. Figure 3 is worthy of some further\ndiscussion.\nFirstly, for the firing engine the opening of the intake valve (IVO) is shortly followed\nby a prolonged pressure depression once the exhaust valve is closed. The full depth\nof this depression occurs when the crankshaft has turned 90o after top dead centre (90\nATDC), which corresponds to the peak piston velocity. The pressure rises quickly\nafter the depression producing a pressure peak sometime between bottom dead centre\n(BDC) and the closing of the intake valve (IVC). The prevailing static pressure is a\nlittle below 1.0 bar. It is noteworthy that the depth of the depression relative to the\nstatic pressure is equal to the height of the pressure peak relative to the same datum.\nThe hypothesis for explaining the shape of the pressure trace is this: until the\ndepression reaches its greatest depth, the pressure time history is governed by the\neffects of the downwards accelerating piston and the opening valve, thereafter it is\ngoverned by wave action. The height of the pressure peak depends on the depth of\nHarrison, Stanev Model for intake wave dynamics: revision 1\n8\nthe depression that proceeds it and that in turn is determined by the maximum piston\nvelocity and the flow area of the opening valve. The realism and the generality of this\nhypothesis will be explored throughout this paper.\nIn addition, Figure 3 shows that the firing of the engine has little effect on the wave\naction in the intake port. The only significant difference results from small pressure\npeak in the valve overlap period (IVO-EVC) for the motored case. Here, poor\nscavenging of the cool air results in high exhaust back pressure late in the exhaust\nstroke and the valve overlap causes reversed flow of air into the intake port and a\ntemporary pressure peak therein.\nA spectrum of the motored pressure is also shown in Figure 3. This spectrum has been\nobtained by digitising long sequences of pressure data at a sample frequency of 4096\nHz and by using a moving Hanning window to produce an average of one hundred\n2048 point FFTs with a spectral resolution of 2 Hz. The pressure oscillation in Figure:\n3 is occurring at 64Hz at 1877 rev\/min, when the valve opens 15.6 times every\nsecond. The wave action is, therefore, occurring as a 4th harmonic of the valve\nactuating frequency. By measuring the crankshaft rotation delay between pressure\npeaks it is clear that the oscillation is occurring at around 64Hz when the valve is\nopen as well as closed.\nThe generality of the points raised by the inspection of Figure 3 is investigated by\ninspecting the results obtained at other running speeds. Figure 4 shows the intake port\npressure at around 1700 rev\/min-1 and Figure 5 shows data at around 1500 rev\/min-1.\nThe points raised for Figure 3 generally apply to Figure 4 except in the latter case the\nHarrison, Stanev Model for intake wave dynamics: revision 1\n9\npressure fluctuation is occurring at 56Hz rather than 64Hz. However, 56Hz remains a\n4th harmonic of the valve actuation frequency at 1690 rev\/min-1.\nThe data in Figure 5 shows some important differences to that of Figure 3. Firstly, the\npressure fluctuates at 64Hz once more but this time it is the 5th harmonic of the valve\nactuation frequency at 1523 rev\/min. In addition, because the fluctuation frequency is\nthe same but the engine speed is lower, whereas in Figure 3 the pressure was above\nthe 1 bar of atmospheric pressure at IVC, in Figure 5 the pressure has had time to dip\nbelow 1 bar by IVC.\nThe fact that 64Hz appears as the dominant frequency at two different engine speeds\nsuggests resonant behaviour in the intake pipe.\nIt seems that the intake pipe has a resonance at a frequency around 60Hz, both when\nthe valve is open and when it is closed, this being the average of 56Hz and 64Hz.\nWhen it is closed, the resonant frequencies of the open\/closed pipe are given by:\nx4\ncn\nf \uf03d (1)\nwhich for n = 1, 3, 5\u2026 , c = 343m\/s, x = 1.4m then fn=1 = 61.25Hz and the agreement\nis good.\nResonance at frequencies corresponding to odd numbers of quarter wavelengths are to\nbe expected in this case where the intake pipe has a noise source (the unsteady flow\nthrough the intake valve) at one end and an open un-flanged termination at the other\nend. Consider Figure: 6 where the right hand end of the figure corresponds to the open\nHarrison, Stanev Model for intake wave dynamics: revision 1\n10\nend of the intake pipe. This end may be viewed as a pressure-release surface where\nthe two travelling waves in the pipe must be in anti-phase at the open end. This anti-\nphase produces a pressure minimum at the open end accompanied by a particle\nvelocity maximum.\nResonance in the pipe will be found when a high sound level is radiated from the open\nend of the pipe when the excitation at the source is only small. This occurs when the\npipe is odd integers of a quarter wavelength long.\nOur earlier hypothesis of the nature of the intake process can now be extended, thus:\nThe early stages of the intake process are governed by the instantaneous values of the\npiston velocity and the open area under the valve. Thereafter resonant wave action\ndominates the process. The depth of the early depression caused by the moving\npiston governs the intensity of the wave action that follows. A pressure ratio across\nthe valve that is favourable to inflow (i.e. one where the pressure in the port is higher\nthan the pressure in the cylinder) is maintained and maximised when the open period\nof the valve is such to allow at least, but no more than, one complete oscillation of the\npressure at its resonant frequency to occur whilst the valve is open. Much less, or\nmuch more than one complete oscillation will result in a lower pressure in the port\nduring the final closing moments of the valve and hence diminished inlet flow.\nThe implications of this hypothesis are as follows. Firstly, the wave action will\nintensify as mean piston speeds increase, thus, as engine speeds increases. Secondly,\nthere will be a narrow range of speeds at which the benefits of a strong and favourable\npressure ratio will be enjoyed. At lower speeds, more than one depression will reduce\nHarrison, Stanev Model for intake wave dynamics: revision 1\n11\nthe benefit. At higher speeds the maximum possible pressure ratio will not be reached\nbefore IVC.\n4 Description of the model\nThe model used in this paper will be described in four sections. Firstly, an equivalent\nacoustic circuit will be presented. Secondly, a model for the unsteady flow through\nthe valve will be described along with some sample output. Thirdly, a model for the\nresonant wave action in the intake pipe will be described, again with sample output.\nFinally, the integration of the components into a single model will be discussed.\nResults for the final model will be shown in Section 5.\n4.1 Overview of the model\nThe model may be described using the equivalent acoustic circuit shown in Figure 7.\nAcoustic circuits have been used elsewhere to describe either the intake or the exhaust\nprocess in IC engines and in compressors [10-16] but these usually show a constant\npressure source with a series impedance.\nReferring to Figure 7, the intake process is described here as two acoustic loads Ze\nand Z1 acting on a volume velocity source of strength Vs and producing an acoustic\npressure P1 immediately at the port side of the valve seat. This seems more realistic\nthan the use of a constant pressure source. Relating this to the sketch of the intake\nprocess shown in Figure 2, Z1 is the specific acoustic load impedance of the intake\nport and pipe applied to an acoustic source of strength Vs and specific source\nHarrison, Stanev Model for intake wave dynamics: revision 1\n12\nimpedance Ze, these two together characterising the unsteady flow through the valve.\nNote the continuity of pressure with:\nP1 = Ze Ue = Z1 U1 (2)\nand the discontinuity in volume velocity with:\ne\n1\n1se Z\nP\nUUU \uf03d\uf02d\uf03d (3)\nNow, the wave action in the intake port is described by the pair P1 and U1.

Thus, the intake problem is reduced to the\nsolution of equation 4.\nHarrison, Stanev Model for intake wave dynamics: revision 1\n13\n4.2 A sub-model for the acoustic source strength Us\nIn Section 4.1 the assumption Us = U1 was put forward for a given intake pipe of\ncross-sectional area S1 , we can write:\nUs = u1 S1 (5)\nWhere Us is the volume velocity (m3\/s) strength of the source, which in turn is the\nvolume velocity through the intake valve and u1 is the acoustic particle velocity in the\nintake port. Us is time varying and it is a function of the rate of change of cylinder\nvolume Vd and of the instantaneous flow area under the valve Sv [17]. A simple, yet\ndimensionally correct relationship would be:\nUs =\n1\nvd\nS\nS\nx\ntd\nVd\n(6)\nFigure 8 shows the rate of change of cylinder volume calculated for the Ricardo E6\nengine with a bore of 76.6mm, a stroke of 110mm and a compression ratio of 10.0\nrunning at 1891 rev\/min. Figure 9 shows the changing area under the opening intake\nvalve, as measured on the test engine fitted with a single intake valve of 35mm\ndiameter and a maximum lift of 9.5mm. The limiting area seen in the data is that of\nthe 35mm diameter intake port. Applying the data from Figures 8 and 9 to Equation 6\nyields a calculation of Us shown in Figure 10. Small reverse flows are shown shortly\nafter IVO and shortly before IVC. These are due to the timings of IVO and IVC\nbeing 8o BTDC and 33o ABDC respectively.\nHarrison, Stanev Model for intake wave dynamics: revision 1\n14\nFigure 10 is reproduced as Figure 11 along with the spectrum of Us. The single cycle\nshown in Figure 10 was repeated many times in a long sequence and by using a\nmoving Hanning window to produce an average of one hundred 1024 point FFTs the\nspectrum shown in Figure: 11 was produced with a spectral resolution of around 1Hz\ndue to the sample frequency being 1008Hz. It is clear that every integer harmonic of\nthe valve actuation frequency of 15.75Hz is present in this spectrum. The 63Hz\ncomponent is close to the value of 61.25Hz calculated as the lowest resonance of the\nintake pipe and this explains the dominance of the 64Hz component found in the\nintake pressure at this speed (Figure 3).\nFigure 12 shows the same analysis for a speed of 1690 rev\/min. The 56Hz component\nof Us is responsible for the dominant 56Hz component of the intake pressure noted in\nFigure 4.\nFigures 13 and 5 show the same effect at 64Hz, this time for a speed of 1523 rev\/min.\n4.3 A sub-model for the load impedance Z1\nA one dimensional, linear, plane wave, frequency domain model of the intake pipe\nhas been prepared following the well-established method developed by Davies [18].\nThe reference point for the model is the acoustic reflection coefficient r for an\nunflanged pipe [19]. At plane x = 0 this gives the ratio of the amplitude of positive\nand negative going wave components po+ and po- respectively, thus:\nHarrison, Stanev Model for intake wave dynamics: revision 1\n15\n\uf02b\n\uf02d\n\uf03d\no\no\no\np\np\nr (7)\nAn end correction of length l accounts for the phasing of po+ and po-, thus:\nr = Rei\u03b8 = - Rei2kl where k is the wavenumber (8)\nValues for R and l vary with the mean Mach number of the inlet flow [20].\nThe wave components at the intake valve can be transformed along the pipe length x,\nthus:\n\uf028 \uf029lx*ik\no1 epp\n\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b \uf03d (9)\n\uf028 \uf029lx*ki\no1 epp\n\uf02b\uf02d\uf02d\uf02d \uf03d (10)\nWhere k* is a complex wavenumber taking Mach number and visco-thermal\nattenuation effects into consideration [18].

For the closed valve case, the mean inlet Mach number is found from:\no1\nIVC\nIVO\ns\ncS\ndtU\nM\n\uf0f2\n\uf03d (13)\nThe mean inlet Mach number for the open valve is higher than this by the factor\n720 \/ (IVC-IVO).\nThe outputs of the Z1 model are shown in Figure 14 for the speed of 1891 rev\/min.\nThe presence of higher mean flow for the open valve case shifts resonant frequencies\ndownwards slightly compared with the closed valve case. Also the magnitude of the\nspecific impedance ratio is altered. Note that resonances occur at values of n = 1, 3,\n5, 7 times the lowest natural frequency of 63Hz as anticipated by equation (1).\nFor the calculations, a slightly reduced pipe length of 1.31mm was used to account for\nthe presence of a carburettor and other flow discontinuities not shown in Figure 1.\nThis revised length was found by experiment using a wave decomposition technique\n[21] to directly measure the specific acoustic impedance spectrum and then by\naltering the pipe length in the theoretical model until the theory matched experiment.\nHarrison, Stanev Model for intake wave dynamics: revision 1\n17\n4.4 A sub-model for the port pressure P1\nFollowing on from equations 4 and 12:\n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\uf05b \uf05dfZxfUIFFTtP 1s\uf03d (14)\nUs (f) is found by taking a single 64 point FFT of the 64 points used in the model to\ndescribe Us for one cycle. The result of this is shown in Figure 15. The apparent\ncoarse spectral resolution is a result of the limited temporal resolution of U1 being\nonly 64 points to describe the 2210 of crankshaft rotation between IVO and IVC.\nIn order to obtain the product in equation 14, the specific acoustic impedance ratio\nspectrum shown in Figure 14 should be recalculated to be a 64 point double sided\nspectrum with a resolution that matches Us (f). Such a spectrum is shown in Figure:\n16.\nThe inverse Fourier transform of equation 14 must be performed twice, once for the\nopen valve values of Z1 and once for the closed valve values. The resulting time\nhistories of P1 are shown for 1891 rev\/min in Figure 17.\nIn order to complete the calculation of P1, the 64-point sequences from equation 14\nmust first be interpolated to 720-point sequences, one value for each degree of\ncrankshaft rotation in the four-stroke cycle. The first few data points from the open\nvalve sequence correspond to the values of P1 for the interval IVO-IVC. The\nHarrison, Stanev Model for intake wave dynamics: revision 1\n18\ncorresponding values from the closed valve sequence are discarded. The remaining\nvalues from the closed valve sequence correspond to the values of P1 for the period\nwhen the valve is closed. The pressure in the intake system will be the composite P1\nadded to the prevailing static pressure.\n5 Results and Discussion\nThe model described in Section 4 has been used to calculate P1 in the intake port of\nthe Ricardo E6 engine at three speeds: 1877, 1661 and 1523 rev\/min. These are\nshown along with measured port pressures in Figures 18, 19 and 20 respectively. The\nvalidation of the calculations is good. There are obvious discontinuities in the\ncalculated results at IVO and at IVC as the calculated pressure record is a composite\nof the results from two separate calculations.\nThe spectrum of the sound pressure level in the intake port is found by taking the FFT\nof one cycle of measured and calculated data at each speed and the results are shown\nin Figures 21, 22 and 23. The agreement between measured and calculated results is\ngood at the lowest resonant frequency of the intake pipe but is prone to error at higher\nfrequencies.\nThere are three possible causes for the differences between the measured and\ncalculated results. The first may be that the model is over-simplified, and in particular\nthe linear plane wave assumption may be inappropriate or the effects of flow-induced\nnoise neglected in the model may be significant in practice. Some researchers report\nnon-linear behaviour in intake ports [22] but there is no evidence of this here. The\nHarrison, Stanev Model for intake wave dynamics: revision 1\n19\nsecond may be lack of realism in the model for Z1, although such models have\nvalidated well in the past [11]. The third and most likely cause of differences is the\nmodel employed for Us which neglects the source impedance and is decoupled from\nthe acoustic load Z1. The sensitivity of the validation to the output from the Us model\nhas been investigated using a second decoupled model for Us.\nFigure 24 shows the output from the Us model described in Section 4.2. In addition\nthe results from a second model are shown where the open flow area under the valve\n(Figure 9) is appropriately scaled to yield a second estimate of Us. The scaling factor\nis calculated such that the two estimates of Us agree at the start of the velocity profile\nand at only one other subsequent point. No physical significance is placed on this\nchoice of scaling, it is merely convenient and appears to be effective. This second\nmodel for Us has been used to produce Figures 25-30 that can be compared directly\nwith Figures 18-23.\nThe results obtained using the second model for Us are a little better than those\nobtained using the first model but differences between measured and calculated\nresults remain.\nIn order to better quantify these differences, the P1 data for one cycle from Figures 25,\n26 and 27 respectively have been repeated many times to form long data sequences.\nBy using a moving Hanning window to produce averages of one hundred 4096 point\nFFTs the spectra shown in Figures: 31, 32, 33 were produced with a spectral\nresolution of 2-3Hz due to the sample frequency being between 9 - 11 kHz across the\nthree speeds.\nHarrison, Stanev Model for intake wave dynamics: revision 1\n20\nIt is clear that the model used to calculate P1 is reliable at the lowest resonant\nfrequency of the intake pipe but tends to underestimate the spectral content at\nharmonics of the valve actuation frequency that are not coincident with that lowest\nresonant frequency. For that reason, the calculated traces for P1 look like smooth\nmodulations of a single resonant frequency, whereas the measured results are\ninvariably more jagged in shape.\nIt is interesting to note that changing the shape of the Us time history did not radically\naffect the calculated values of P1. This suggests that finding a third uncoupled model\nfor Us is unlikely to improve the realism of the calculations and that the need to\ncouple the acoustic source with its load is inevitable if improvements on the current\nmethod are to be made.\n6 Conclusions\nThe simplified linear acoustic model reported here produces a calculation of the\npressure time-history in the port of an IC engine that agrees fairly well with measured\ndata obtained on a single cylinder research engine fitted with a simple intake system.\nThe model has proved useful in identifying the role of pipe resonance in the intake\nprocess and has led to the development of a simple hypothesis to explain the structure\nof the intake pressure time history. That hypothesis is:\nThe early stages of the intake process are governed by the instantaneous values of the\npiston velocity and the open area under the valve. Thereafter resonant wave action\nHarrison, Stanev Model for intake wave dynamics: revision 1\n21\ndominates the process. The depth of the early depression caused by the moving\npiston governs the intensity of the wave action that follows. A pressure ratio across\nthe valve that is favourable to inflow is maintained and maximised when the open\nperiod of the valve is such to allow at least, but no more than, one complete\noscillation of the pressure at its resonant frequency to occur whilst the valve is open.\nFuture improvements to the method will have to concentrate on the coupling between\nthe unsteady flow through the valve (the acoustic source) and the wave action in the\nintake pipe (the acoustic load).\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge the support of EPSRC under Grant No:\nGR\/R04324 for this work.\nHarrison, Stanev Model for intake wave dynamics: revision 1\n22\nReferences\n1 D E Winterbone, R J Pearson, 1999\nDesign Techniques for Engine Manifolds \u2013 Wave Action Methods for IC\nEngines\nProfessional Engineering Publishing\n2 R.
