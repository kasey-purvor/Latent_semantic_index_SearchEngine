The analyses of this investigation give a complete overview on the statistical association of Cd, Hg and Pb concentrations in mosses and sampling site-specific and regional characteristics, encompassing data from 4661 (1990), 7301 (1995), 6764 (2000) and 5600 (2005) sampling sites across Europe.

The analyses encompassed data from 4661 (1990), 7301 (1995), 6764 (2000) and 5600 \n(2005) sampling sites. As exemplary case studies revealed that other factors besides atmospheric \ndeposition of metals influence the element concentrations in mosses, the moss datasets of the \nabove mentioned surveys were analysed by means of bi- and multivariate statistics in order to \nidentify factors influencing metal bioaccumulation. In the analyses we used the metadata recorded \nduring the sampling as well as additional geodata e.g. on depositions, emissions and land use. \nBivariate Spearman correlation analyses showed the highest correlations between Cd and Pb \nconcentrations in mosses and EMEP modelled total deposition data (0.62 \u2264 rs \u2264 0.73). For Hg the \ncorrelations with all the tested factors were considerably lower (e.g. total deposition rs \u2264 0.24). \nMultivariate decision tree analyses by means of Classification and Regression Trees (CART) \nidentified the total deposition as the statistically most significant factor for the Cd and Pb \nconcentrations in the mosses in all four monitoring campaigns. For Hg, the most significant factor \n8 \nin 1990 as identified by CART was the distance to the nearest Hg source recorded in the European \nPollutant Emission Register, in 1995 and 2000 it was the analytical method, and in 2005 CART \nidentified the sampled moss species. The strong correlations between the Cd and Pb concentrations \nin the mosses and the total deposition can be used to calculate deposition maps with a regression \nkriging approach on the basis of surface maps on the element concentrations in the mosses. \n \nIntroduction \nThe European moss surveys are based on the basic research conducted by R\u00fchling \nand Tyler (1968, 1969, 1970), which showed that mosses accumulate heavy \nmetals over several years. Carpet forming, ectohydric mosses obtain most trace \nelements and nutrients directly from the atmosphere (wet and dry deposition) with \nlittle uptake from the substrate and therefore are particularly suitable for \nmonitoring of airborne pollutants. Monitoring the metal concentration of mosses \nprovides a surrogate, time-integrated measure of element deposition from the \natmosphere to terrestrial systems. As moss biomonitoring studies are comparably \ncheap, a higher sampling density can be achieved than with conventional \ndeposition measurements. Since 1990, mosses are used as biomonitors of \natmospheric heavy metal deposition at the European scale in a project currently \ncoordinated by the UNECE1 ICP Vegetation2 (Harmens et al. 2008a). Four moss \nsurveys have been performed in at least 21 European countries every five years \n(Harmens et al. 2008a). The aim of these studies is to map spatial and temporal \npatterns of atmospheric metal accumulation in terrestrial ecosystems by means of \nectohydric mosses. In the 2005 European moss survey the mosses have also been \napplied as biomonitors of atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition for the first time \n(Harmens et al. 2008b). \n \nAlthough mosses proved to be suitable as biomonitors of atmospheric heavy metal \ndeposition at various scales, several studies revealed that element concentrations \nin mosses can be confounded by factors such as moss species, canopy drip, \nprecipitation, altitude, windblown dust and sea-spray (e.g. Zechmeister et al. \n2003). Hence, in Germany the available measurement data and sampling site-\ndescribing metadata from the four surveys 1990, 1995, 2000 and 2005 were \ninvestigated statistically. Complementary methods were applied to test the \nhypothesis, if other factors besides the atmospheric deposition affect the spatial \npatterns of metal and nitrogen accumulation in mosses. The studies were \nperformed with bivariate correlation and contingency analyses (Pesch and \nSchr\u00f6der 2006a) and with decision tree models (Kleppin et al. 2008, Pesch and \nSchr\u00f6der 2006b, Pesch et al. 2007, Schr\u00f6der et al. 2008), but did not include data \non atmospheric depositions as a possible influence factor. From these studies it \nwas concluded that mainly the moss species and variables associated with canopy \ndrip, elevation, precipitation and the sea-salt-effect seem to influence the spatial \nvariation of the metal concentrations in mosses. These factors proved to be \ncorrelated with the metal bioaccumulation as strong as factors related to the \ndegree of urbanisation and pollution around the sampling sites.  \n \n                                                 \n1\n United Nations Economic Commission for Europe \n2\n International Cooperative Programme on Effects of Air Pollution on Natural \nVegetation and Crops \n9 \nIn a recent analysis of the 2005 moss data it could be shown that Cd and Pb \nconcentrations in mosses, in contrast to Hg concentrations, were primarily \ndetermined by modelled atmospheric deposition of these metals across Europe \n(Schr\u00f6der et al. submitted). The aim of the current study was to validate these \nfindings for previous European moss surveys (1990, 1995, 2000). Bi- and \nmultivariate statistical methods were applied to the moss data and an extensive set \nof variables assumed to influence metal accumulation in mosses. In the analysis, \nCd, Hg and Pb concentrations in mosses were related to point and surface data on, \namongst others, EMEP (European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme) \nmodelled emissions and depositions, land use, altitude and the metadata recorded \nduring sampling and determination of heavy metal concentrations in mosses.  \n \nMaterials and methods \nMoss data \nIn this study moss samples collected across Europe from 4661 sites in 1990\/1 \n(R\u00fchling 1994), 7301 sites in 1995\/6 (R\u00fchling and Steinnes 1998), 6764 sites in \n2000\/1 (Buse et al. 2003) and 5600 sites in 2005\/6 (Harmens et al. 2008a) were \nincluded in the analysis. Throughout the paper we refer to the years of moss \nsurvey as 1990, 1995, 2000 and 2005 respectively. The moss sampling procedure \nwas according to the guidelines described in the monitoring protocol (e.g. ICP \nVegetation 2005). Pleurozium schreberi, Hylocomium splendens, Hypnum \ncupressiforme and Pseudoscleropodium purum were the most frequently sampled \nmoss species. Only the last three years\u2019 growth of moss material was used for the \ndetermination of heavy metal concentrations. Moss tissue was dried at 40\u00b0 C \n(room temperature for Hg) and either dissolved in concentrated nitric acid (with or \nwithout hydrogen peroxide or perchloric acid) or not dissolved before analysis \n(e.g. when neutron activation analysis was used). Acid digestion of samples was \nperformed on a hotplate or in a microwave oven using a range of temperatures. \nThe metal concentrations were determined by use of atomic absorption \nspectrometry, inductively coupled plasma spectrometry (both ICP optical \nemission spectrometry and ICP mass spectrometry), fluorescence spectrometry, \nneutron activation analysis and advanced Hg analysis3. All element concentrations \n(including Hg) were expressed as mg kg-1 dry weight at 40\u00b0 C. In 1995 and 2005, \na quality control exercise to assess the analytical performance of the participating \nlaboratories was conducted using the moss reference materials M2 and M3 \n(Steinnes et al. 1997; Harmens et al. submitted). Some laboratories used \nadditional certified reference material for quality assurance. For the determination \nof the elemental concentrations in the reference materials the laboratories \nfollowed the same analytical procedure as used for the analyses of the moss \nsamples.  \nSite-describing and regional data \nSite-describing data recorded during moss sampling are very sparse for all four \nsurveys and did also not include enough information on relevant factors \npotentially influencing the heavy metal concentration in the mosses. Therefore, \n                                                 \n3\n These advanced techniques include instrumental methods like AMA 245, CV-AAS and \nPS200 Mercury-Analyser. \n10 \nadditional information from surface maps and point datasets was intersected with \nthe moss sampling sites. To account for the influence of precipitation on the \nelement concentrations in the mosses, long-term monthly means (1961- 1990) \nfrom the Global Climate Dataset (CL 2.0), provided by the Climate Research Unit \nof the School of Environmental Sciences, University of East Anglia, were used in \na resolution of 12.5 x 12.5 km\u00b2. To supplement the site-specific data with regard \nto information on land use, the proportions of land use were derived from the \nCorine Land Cover map 2000 (Keil et al. 2005). The area percentage of urban, \nforested and agricultural land use categories in a radius of 1, 5, 10, 25 km for \nforests and agriculture or 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 75 and 100 km for urban areas around \neach raster cell was calculated and then projected onto either the 1 x 1 or 2 x 2 \nkm\u00b2 grid cells (Table 2). The sea spray-effect (Berg and Steinnes 1997) was \nassessed in terms of the distances of the monitoring sites to the coastlines of the \nAtlantic Ocean and the Baltic, Black and Mediterranean Sea. We further added \nthe distance of each sampling site to the nearest industrial sites recorded in the \nEuropean Pollutant Emission Register (EPER) and the respective emission values \nfor Cd, Hg and Pb released into the air to the moss datasets. Finally, we \nintersected the moss sampling sites with data on modelled natural (Cd, Pb), \nanthropogenic (Cd, Hg, Pb) and total emissions (Cd, Pb) as well as the total \ndeposition (Cd, Hg, Pb) provided by the Meteorological Synthesizing Centre-East \n(MSC-E) of EMEP. These data with a resolution of 50 x 50 km\u00b2 are based on the \nMSCE-HM atmospheric transport model which has been described in detail by \nAas and Breivik (2008), Ilyin et al. (2008) and Gusev et al. (2009). For the metal \nconcentrations in mosses the median for each of the 50 x 50 km\u00b2 EMEP raster \ncells was used for the correlation analysis. The modelled EMEP emission and \ndeposition data of the year of moss sampling were assigned to the datasets as well \nas the mean value of the three years before the sampling as the analysed moss \nshoots represent the recent three years of growth. \n \nThe statistical analyses were performed using the Cd, Hg and Pb concentrations in \nmosses, the EMEP modelled data and the additional data are listed in Table 1. The \nanalyses were limited to the above metals as these are the only metals for which \natmospheric deposition is modelled by EMEP. The additional data sets include \nsite-specific characteristics as documented by the participating countries and also \nregional characteristics which might influence the heavy metal accumulation in \nmosses (Berg and Steinnes 1997; Herpin et al. 2004; Schr\u00f6der et al. 2008; \nZechmeister et al. 2003). In the following, these site-specific and regional \ncharacteristics are referred to as predictors. \n \nTable 1: Predictor variables for the metal accumulation in mosses \n \nStatistical analyses \nBivariate correlation analysis was used to analyse the strength and direction of the \nstatistical relationship between the metal concentrations in mosses and the \npredictors. We decided to compute the Spearman rank correlation coefficient rs \nbecause the metal concentrations mostly proved to be not normally distributed. \nAlthough this non-parametric correlation method is less powerful than parametric \nmethods if the assumptions underlying the latter are met, it is less likely to give \ndistorted results when the assumptions fail. The coefficient rs equals -1 if the two \n11 \nrankings are completely contrary, 0 if the rankings are completely independent \nand +1 if there is an outright agreement between the two rankings. Within the \ninterval [-1,+1] the strength of correlation was classified according to Hagl \n(2008): rs values < \u25020.2\u2502 are very low, between \u25020.2\u2502 and \u25020.5\u2502 low, from \n\u25020.5\u2502 to \u25020.7\u2502 moderate, between \u25020.7\u2502 and \u25020.9\u2502 high and > \u25020.9\u2502 very \nhigh. In this context statistical significance refers to how general a relationship is \nand the likelihood that the observed relationship occurred by chance.  \n \nIn addition to the correlation analysis, Classification and Regression Trees \n(CART, Breiman et al. 1984) were used to analyse the multivariate correlations \nbetween the metal concentrations in the mosses and the predictor variables. CART \ncan use an explanatory variable more than once, so it is able to work with multiple \ninterrelated data. CART can reveal hierarchical and non-linear relationships \namong one dependent variable (metal concentration in the mosses) and several \ndescribing variables (regional characteristics of the sampling sites such as \ndepositions and land cover data) by sub-dividing a heterogeneous data set into \nmore homogeneous sub-sets (classes or nodes) by a series of nested binary \u2018if-\nthen-else\u2019 splits. Each split maximises the homogeneity of the dependent variable. \nEach possible binary split for all variables is evaluated recursively for the best \nclass separation until homogeneous end nodes are reached. The predictor selected \nis the one for which the two new classes have the greatest within-group similarity \nfor the response variable. The two new classes are then examined separately, with \nrespect to each of the predictor variables, to see if they can be split again. The \nresulting dendrogram can have multiple branches, each of which represents a path \nto a particular combination of independent variables defining variable sub-spaces. \nResults \nThe EMEP modelled total deposition of Cd and Pb and their concentrations in \nmosses were moderately to highly correlated (Table 2): the maximum correlation \ncoefficients for Cd were 0.69 for the year of sampling and 0.68 for the 3-year \naccumulation period repectively (moss survey 2000, p < 0.001). For Pb, the \nhighest correlation coefficient was 0.73, both for the year of sampling and the 3 \nyear accumulation period (moss survey 2005, p < 0.001). Hardly any difference \nwere found when relating moss concentrations to EMEP modelled deposition for \neither the year of sampling or the three years previous to sampling the mosses. In \ncontrast, the correlations between EMEP modelled total Hg deposition and \nconcentrations in mosses were either not significant or low to very low. The \nhighest correlation was found for the moss survey 2000; year of sampling: rs = \n0.22, 3 year accumulation period: rs = 0.24 (p < 0.001).  \n \nThe correlations with anthropogenic emissions were generally moderate for Cd \nand Pb, reaching correlation coefficients of up to 0.68 for Pb in the moss survey \n2005. For Hg, again the correlations were either not significant or very low (rs < \n0.20). For natural emissions, data were only available for Cd and Pb and the \ncorrelation coefficients ranged between 0.40 and 0.60. For total emissions \nSpearman correlation coefficients of up to 0.65 were found (Pb, moss survey \n2005).  \n \nTable 2: Spearman rank correlation coefficients between Cd, Hg, and Pb concentrations in mosses \nand modelled EMEP data; n.a. = not available, n.s. = not significant. \n \n12 \nThe correlations with the site-describing variables were generally low to very low \nwith the exception of the proportion of urban land uses in the surroundings of the \nsampling sites, which is in case of Cd and Pb and large radii were often \nmoderately correlated (Table 3). There appears to be a trend of increasing \ncorrelation coefficients with increasing radii of land use proportions. \n \nTable 3: Correlation between concentrations of Cd, Hg, and Pb in mosses and site or regional \ncharacteristics. \n \nThe results of the decision tree analyses were further processed on the basis of a \nweighted index as presented by Kleppin et al. (2008). This index uses the \nfrequency of selection of each predictor and weighs it by the tree level it was \nchosen in, so that a predictor chosen in a lower tree level is weighted less than a \npredictor chosen as often but in higher tree levels. For Cd, the most important \npredictor as indicated by the calculated index (5.0) was the total EMEP modelled \ndeposition in the year of sampling (yos), followed by the analytical method \napplied (1.33) and the moss species (1.0; Table 4). All other predictors have index \nvalues below 1.0. The most important predictor for Hg were the analytical method \n(3.17), the sampled moss species (2.0), the distance to the nearest Hg emission \nsource recorded in the European pollutant Emission Register (EPER) (1.33) and \nthe share of forested areas in the surroundings of the sampling sites (1.16). As for \nCd, the total EMEP modelled deposition in the year of sampling was identified as \nthe most important predictor for Pb (4.33), followed by the 3 years mean of the \ntotal EMEP modelled deposition (1.5) and the distance to the nearest Pb source \nrecorded in the EPER (1.33). \n \nTable 4: Index values calculate from decision tree analyses using CART.  \n \nDiscussion \nFor Cd and Pb, the results of the current study show a moderate to high and \nsignificant positive correlation between the EMEP modelled total deposition and \nconcentrations in mosses for all the moss survey years. This is in agreement with \nthe results previously reported for 2005 (Schr\u00f6der et al. submitted) and results \nreported for individual countries. For example, for Cd Berg and Steinnes (1997) \nand Berg et al. (1995) found a significant positive correlation between the \nconcentration in the moss H. splendens and P. schreberi and wet deposition (r\u00b2 = \n0.82 - 0.84), for Pb the correlation was even higher (r\u00b2 = 0.98 - 1.00). The \ncorrelation coefficients in the current study are not as strong, because they are not \nbased on deposition measurements and moss sampling at identical sites, as was \nthe case for the studies by Berg et al. (1995) and Berg and Steinnes (1997). We \nrelated the modelled emission and deposition data to the medians of all moss \nsampling sites located within the respective 50 x 50 km\u00b2 EMEP grid cells. Hence, \nwe investigated the association between deposition and moss accumulation at a \nbroader spatial scale. Nevertheless, the modelled deposition data shows the \nhighest correlations with the Cd and Pb concentrations in the mosses and is the \nmost significant predictor in the decision trees calculated for these metals. \nTherefore, mosses are a valuable tool for determining spatial and temporal \nvariations in atmospheric depositions at a high spatial resolution across Europe for \nCd and Pb.  \n13 \n \nIn an investigation in Germany (Pesch et al. 2007), positive low to moderate \ncorrelations between the metal concentration in mosses and in bulk deposition \nmeasured in the open field (ICP Forests Level II 1998, 1999, 2000) were found \nfor Cd (0 < rs \u2264 0.5, n = 18), Cu (0 < rs \u2264 0.5, n = 17), Pb (0.3 \u2264 rs \u2264 0.5, n = 18), \nand Zn (rs = 0.5, n = 27). For throughfall deposition and the moss concentrations \nthe correlations were very low for Cd (0 < rs \u2264 0.2, n = 20) and Pb (0 < rs \u2264 0.1, n \n= 21), low for Cu (rs = 0.3, n = 17), and low to moderate in case of Zn (0.3 \u2264 rs \u2264 \n0.6, n = 32). Furthermore, for Cd in mosses a correlation of 1.0 was found with \nwet only deposition data from the air monitoring network of the Federal \nEnvironment Agency (FEA) (\u03a3 2004-2005, n = 6). \n \nIn addition to the total deposition which primarily determines the Cd and Pb \nconcentrations in the mosses, other factors contribute to the scatter in the \nrelationships observed. The correlation analyses show significant, however, \nmostly very low, low or moderate relationships with numerous factors, of which \nthe proportion of urban land uses shows the highest association with the element \nconcentrations in the mosses. The influence of urban emissions on the \nbioaccumulation of Cd, Hg and Pb in mosses has also been observed by Ani\u010di\u0107 et \nal. (2007), Co\u015fkun et al. (2005), Figueira et al. (2002), and Gramatica et al. \n(2006). In the framework of analyses of the German data from the moss survey \n2005, Pesch et al. (2007) also found highly significant correlations of the \nconcentrations of As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb, Sb and Zn in mosses and the \nproportion of urban areas in a radius of 5 km around the sampling sites. For Cd \nand Pb significant negative correlations with the proportion of forested areas in \nthe surroundings of the sampling sites have been found. Here, the forests may \nindicate background areas with a low influence of urban emissions but may also \nrelate to the fact that forests filter heavy metals out of the air. The proportion of \nagricultural areas is positively correlated with the Cd and Pb concentrations in \nmosses which is in contrast to the results of Pesch et al. (2007), who found \nnegative correlations for Cd, Ni, Pb and Sb as well as a positive correlation for Cr \nin Germany. However, Figueira et al. (2002) mention agricultural practices as a \nsource of Cd in the environment. Except for Cd in 2005, precipitation is \npositively, but generally very low correlated with the Cd and Pb bioaccumulation \nin mosses, which may be caused by increased wet deposition (\u010ceburnis and \nValiulis 1999, Frahm 1998, Herpin et al. 1996, Schr\u00f6der et al. 2008, Zechmeister \n1995). In addition, metals deposited on trees and shrubs growing above the \nmosses may rinse onto the mosses and accumulate in them (Couto et al. 2004, \nFernandez and Carballeira 2002, Okland et al. 1999, Schr\u00f6der et al. 2008, \nZechmeister et al. 2003) or soil particles containing metal elements may be \nsplashed onto the mosses at sites with low soil coverage (Ani\u010di\u0107 et al. 2007, \nBargagli 1995, Co\u015fkun et al. 2005, Fernandez and Carballeira 2002). In contrast, \nBerg and Steiness (1997), Couto et al. (2004), Herpin et al. (1996) and Sharma \n(2007) report lower element concentrations in mosses as a consequence of a \nleaching of accumulated elements from the mosses or a wash-off of deposited \nmaterials from the mosses. These contrasting results reported on the influence on \nprecipitation on heavy metal concentrations in mosses might well explain the very \nlow correlations observed in this study. The distance to the sea is positively \ncorrelated with the Cd and Pb concentrations in the mosses. This is in accordance \nwith Berg et al. (1995) who reported on the influence of sea salt cations (Ca, Mg) \non the bioaccumulation of As, Cd, Cu, Pb, V and Zn; these sea salt cations \n14 \ncompete with heavy metals for the same cation exchange sites in the mosses. \nWhen atmospheric deposition of metals was not taken into account, Kleppin et al. \n(2008) found the distance to the sea to be the third most important predictor in \ndecision tree analyses of German moss survey data from 1990, 1995 and 2000. \nPesch et al. (2007) found negative correlations with the distance to the sea for Cr \nand V, but reported positive correlations for As, Cd, Cu, Fe, Hg, Ni, Pb, Sb, Ti \nand Zn for Germany. \n \nFor Hg, the correlations between its concentrations in mosses and EMEP \nmodelled total deposition was low to very low. As Hg in ambient air is \npredominantly found in the vapour phase and has a residence time of the order of \none year it has to be considered as a \u201cglobal pollutant\u201d (Schroeder and Munthe \n1998) without distinct spatial deposition patterns. Multivariate analysis indicated \nthat the Hg concentration in mosses is primarily determined by the analytical \ntechnique, but the sampled moss species plays also a major role (Table 4). The \nformer might reflect that the determination of Hg is analytically still more \nchallenging than that of Cd and Pb. It seems likely, however, that the lack of \ncorrelation between modelled deposition values for Hg and observed \nconcentrations in moss may relate to the specific chemistry of Hg and \ncorresponding interactions with the moss. Hg is believed to be taken up primarily \nin its gaseous form, at least in plants (De Temmerman et al. 2007, 2009). For \nNorway it was reported that mosses are able to retain dry deposited gaseous Hg to \na significant extent (e.g. Steinnes et al. 2003). It might well be that the deposition \npattern depicted by the moss survey is a better measure of the net Hg supply to the \nterrestrial ecosystem than that indicated by EMEP modelled calculations \n(Harmens et al. submitted; Schr\u00f6der et al. submitted). \nConclusions \nConsidering the intrinsic uncertainties of the EMEP model (Ilyin and Travnikov \n2005) and uncertainties associated with heavy metal emission data, and potential \nlimitations in the use of moss data as monitors of atmospheric deposition \n(Harmens et al. 2008a), the moss and deposition data agree reasonably well, at \nleast for Cd and Pb. The statistical analyses confirmed that the concentrations of \nthese elements in the mosses are primarily determined by the atmospheric \ndeposition and that mosses can therefore be used as biomonitors for these \nelements. For Hg, the use of mosses at biomonitors of atmospheric deposition \nrequires further investigation, however, it might well be that the mercury \nconcentration in mosses better reflects the actual deposition to vegetation than that \nmodelled by EMEP model. Correlations can not be expected to equal 1 since \ndeposition and bioaccumulation are not identical but coupled processes in the \ncomplex chain of emission, transportation, deposition and accumulation (Lindberg \nand Turner 1988). This chain of processes and especially the deposition and \naccumulation processes show distinct differences over time and also across spatial \nscales (Fr\u00e4nzle et al. 1995).  \n \nFor Cd and Pb, the strong correlations between the element concentrations in the \nmosses and the total deposition can be used to calculate deposition maps with a \nregression kriging approach on the basis of surface maps on the element \nconcentrations in the mosses (Hengl et al. 2007, Odeh et al. 1995). \n \n15 \nThe moss survey is the only European environmental programme that enables \ndetecting the spatial variability of heavy metal deposition in terrestrial ecosystems \nin a way that can be proven to be geostatistically valid. In this context, the moss \nsurvey features a range of advantages in comparison with other monitoring \napproaches: readily identifiable in the field; widely distributed; easy to sample \nrepeatedly throughout time to capture temporal variability and cheap, where the \ncost of sampling and the cost of the following laboratory analyses should be such \nthat sufficient replicates and statistical rigour can be obtained (Osborn et al. 2000; \nPakeman et al. 2000).  \nAcknowledgements \nWe thank the United Kingdom Department for Environment, Food and Rural \nAffairs (Defra; contract EPG 1\/3\/170, EPG 1\/3\/205, AQ03509 and AQ0810), the \nUNECE (Trust Fund) and the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) for \nfunding the ICP Vegetation Programme Coordination Centre at CEH Bangor, UK. \nThe contributions of many more scientists and all the funding bodies in each \ncountry are gratefully acknowledged (for full details see R\u00fchling (1994), R\u00fchling \nand Steinnes (1998), Buse et al.
