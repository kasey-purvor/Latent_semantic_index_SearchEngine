Our data imply a scaffolding function of Nesprin-2 at the nuclear membrane and suggest a potential involvement\nof this multi-isomeric protein in human disease.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe eukaryotic nucleus is a dynamic, highly organized or-\nganelle where several vital biological functions take place.\nAlthough its essence is undisputed, very little is known\nabout its structural composition and architecture. The recent\ninvolvement of the nuclear envelope proteins lamin A\/C\nand lamin-associated proteins in human diseases, however,\nin conjunction with the discovery of novel nuclear structural\nproteins has placed the nuclear architecture and its struc-\ntural framework in the scientific spotlight (Burke and Stew-\nart, 2002; Worman and Courvalin, 2002).\nUntil recently only microtubules and associated proteins\nwere implicated in nuclear migratory events (Morris, 2003).\nGenetic evidence, however, from Caenorhabditis elegans sug-\ngests that nuclear migration and nuclear anchorage also\ninvolves the actin cytoskeleton because mutations in ANC-1\naffect the positioning of nuclei and mitochondria in C. el-\negans (Starr and Han, 2002). ANC-1 is a giant actin-binding\ndystrophin-like protein localizing to the nuclear envelope in\nan UNC-84 and lamin-dependent manner (Malone et al.,\n1999; Lee et al., 2002). Together with the recently discovered\nmammalian proteins Nesprin-1\/Enaptin and Nesprin-2\/\nNUANCE, ANC-1 of C. elegans, MSP-300 of Drosophila mela-\nnogaster, and interaptin from Dictyostelium discoideum are\nindeed the first examples of actin-binding proteins that re-\nside at the nuclear membrane (Rivero et al., 1998; Zhang et\nal., 2001, 2002; Mislow et al., 2002a; Starr and Han, 2002;\nZhen et al., 2002; Padmakumar et al., 2004). The hallmark of\nthe family is a single C-terminal transmembrane domain,\nwhich is separated from the N-terminal \u0001-actinin\u2013type actin-\nbinding domain (ABD) by a large central coiled coil. Their\nC-terminus is highly conserved in evolution and responsible\nfor nuclear envelope targeting (Zhang et al., 2001; Zhen et al.,\n2002).\nNesprin-1 and -2 are the vertebrate orthologues of ANC-1\nand are encoded by two separate genes. Both genes are\ncomplex and code for several splice variants that differ in\nlength, domain composition, and their expression pattern\n(Zhang et al., 2001, 2002; Padmakumar et al., 2004). This\ndiversity in architecture and function is illustrated in the\nnames that were used to describe the various products of\nthose two genes. The small C-terminal variants of Nesprin-1\nare also known as syne-1 and myne-1 (Apel et al., 2000;\nZhang et al., 2001; Mislow et al., 2002a), the ones of Nesprin-2\nas syne-2 (Zhang et al., 2002). The giant ABD-containing\nThis article was published online ahead of print in MBC in Press\n(http:\/\/www.molbiolcell.org\/cgi\/doi\/10.1091\/mbc.E04\u201311\u20131009)\non April 20, 2005.\nAddress correspondence to: Angelika A. Noegel (noegel@uni-koeln.de).\nAbbreviations used: aa, amino acids; ABD, actin-binding domain;\nCo-IP, coimmunoprecipitation; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylin-\ndole; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase;\nNUANCE, nucleus and actin connnecting element; Nesprins, nu-\nclear envelope spectrin repeat proteins; siRNA, small interference\nRNA; X-EDMD, X-linked Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy.\n\u00a9 2005 by The American Society for Cell Biology 3411\nisoforms of the Nesprin-1 and -2 gene loci have been termed\nas Enaptin and NUANCE, respectively (Zhen et al., 2002;\nPadmakumar et al., 2004). For nesprin-1\u0001, a direct binding to\nemerin and lamin A in vitro had been reported previously\n(Mislow et al., 2002a, 2002b).\nBecause Nesprin-2 is highly homologous to Nesprin-1, we\ninvestigated whether it also associates with inner nuclear\nenvelope components. In this report we provide evidence\nthat Nesprin-2 binds both in vitro and in vivo to lamin A\/C\nand emerin. We also provide data demonstrating that the\nlocalization and function of Nesprin proteins at the nuclear\nenvelope depends on the lamin A\/C network, suggesting\nthat lamin mutations may affect the function of Nesprin-1\nand -2 at the nuclear membrane. In addition, we provide\nevidence that Nesprin-2 localizes to both sites of the NE and\nis crucial for the nuclear envelope localization of emerin,\nthus implicating\u2014either directly or indirectly\u2014the Nesprin\ngenes in human disorders.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nConstruction of Plasmids\nGST-K1 was made by cloning a BamHI\/SalI PCR human Nesprin-2\/\nNUANCE fragment (AAL33548; aa 6546\u20136796) into the pGEX-4T-1 vector\n(Amersham, Piscataway, NJ). Nesprin-2SR (AAL33548; aa 6146\u20136799) was\ngenerated by PCR, using the 5\u0001-CGCTTGAGGACTGGCTCAAGTC-3\u0001 and\n5\u0001-CTTGAGAGGAAGGAGCGCT-3\u0001 primers, and subcloned into the ZERO\nblunt TOPO cloning vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Sequencing revealed\nthat we accidentally introduced a stop codon at position 20,611 resulting in a\nprotein coding for aa 6146\u20136799 of Nesprin-2\/NUANCE. The Nesprin-2\nfragment was ligated into the EcoRI sites of pGADT7\/pGBKT7 (BD Bio-\nsciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), pGEX-4T-1 and pEGFP-C2 (BD Biosciences,\nSan Diego, CA). The plasmid dnNesprin-2 is equivalent to GFP-Cterm1 (aa\n6570\u20136883), which was published recently (Zhen et al., 2002). TmNesprin-2\nwas amplified by PCR using the 5\u0001-GGAATTCGGCAGCCCTACCCCTGC-3\u0001\nand 5\u0001-CGGGATCCCTATGTGGGGGGTGGCC-3\u0001 primers, and the amplified\nfragment was cloned into EcoRI\/BamHI-digested pEGFP-C1. The GFP fusion\nprotein corresponds to aa 6833\u20136883 of the human Nesprin-2\/NUANCE\nprotein (AAL33548). For generating dnEnaptin we cloned an EcoRI\/SalI PCR\nfragment into the pEGFP-C2 plasmid, which was amplified by primers 5\u0001-\nGTGAATTCCAGTTTAATTCTGACCTCAAC-3\u0001 and 5\u0001-GTGTCGACTTCA-\nGAGTGGAGGAGGACCG-3\u0001 (corresponding to aa 8392\u20138749 of human\nEnaptin), using the mouse EST BC041779 (IMAGE) clone as a template. Yeast\ntwo-hybrid plasmids pGBT9\/pGAD24-lamin A were provided by Dr. Wor-\nman (Ye and Worman, 1995). GST-Lamin A was obtained by inserting an\nEcoRI-SalI-digested fragment of pGBT9 into the EcoRI-SalI site of pGEX-4T-1.\nGST-N-term lamin was generated by inserting an EcoRI\/SalI-digested PCR\nproduct amplified with 5\u0001-GAATTCATGGAGACCCCGTCCCAGCGGC-3\u0001\nand 5\u0001-GTCGACCAGGTCACCCTCCTTCTTGGTATTG-3\u0001, into the EcoRI\/\nSalI site of pGEX-4T-1. The human lamin C GST fusion proteins coil1B-delta,\ncoil2, tail, and delta-lamin C were a generous gift of Dr. Ernoult-Lange\n(Dreuillet et al., 2002). The human emerin recombinant protein (residues\n1\u2013222) was a generous gift of Dr. Kathy Wilson (Lee et al., 2001). GFP-\nlaminB1D2\u0002 is described in Vaughan et al. (2001).\nYeast Two-hybrid Assay\nThe methods for performing the yeast two-hybrid assay have been described\nin detail elsewhere (MATCHMAKER Two-Hybrid System 2 Catalogue no.\nK1604\u20131; Clontech).\nPurification of GST Fusion Proteins and In Vitro Binding\nAssays\nThe purification of GST fusion proteins and GST pulldown experiments were\nperformed as described (Dreuillet et al., 2002). For the pulldown assay using\nCOS7 cells, lysis was performed using 50 mM Tris\/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM\nNaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors (Roche, Mannheim, Germany).\nThe 100,000 \u0003 g supernatant of the lysate was incubated with equal amounts\nof GST-K1 and GST-SR fusion proteins. The solutions were incubated at 4\u00b0C\novernight with GST-Sepharose beads on a roller. Samples were centrifuged\nand the pellets (washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline [PBS])\nwere analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis.\nBlot-overlay Assay\nPurified GST and Escherichia coli cell lysates expressing GST-lamin A were\nanalyzed by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a membrane. After 1 h of blocking\n(5% milk powder in NCP buffer: 10 mM Tris\/HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl,\n0.05% Tween20) the blot was incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with the purified\nGST-SR recombinant fusion protein. After an extensive washing step with\nNCP buffer, the blot was incubated with the Nesprin-2\u2013specific monoclonal\nantibody (mAb) K49\u2013260 (described in this work) for 1 h at room tempera-\nture. The blot was washed with NCP buffer and incubated with anti-mouse\nIgG conjugated to peroxidase for 1 h at room temperature. After washing\nthree times with NCP buffer, the blot was subjected to ECL detection.\nsiRNA Knockdown of Lamin A\/C and Nesprin-2\nThe lamin A\/C knockdown was performed as described (Harborth et al.,\n2001). A431 cells were grown at 37\u00b0C in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal\ncalf serum (FCS), penicillin, and streptomycin. One day before transfection, cells were\ntrypsinized and transferred into six-well plates. The next day the cells were washed\nwith Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Karlsruhe, Germany), cultured for 30 min in\nOpti-MEM, and transiently transfected using oligofectamine (Invitrogen) and 12 \u0002l\nof a 20 \u0002M solution of siRNA duplexes for lamin A\/C per well. The specific\nRNA-Dimer (Harborth et al., 2001; Dharmacon, Boulder, CO) targets the sequence of\nhuman lamin A\/C from base 608\u2013626. After 4 h of transfection Opti-MEM was\nremoved and replaced with DMEM containing 10% FCS medium. After 3 d the cells\nwere fixed and indirect immunofluorescence was performed or analyzed by SDS-\nPAGE and Western blot analysis. For the knockdown experiments of Nesprin-2, the\noligonucleotides 5\u0001-GATCCCCTTTGGACAATTATCCTGCATTCAAGAGATG-\nCAGGATAATTGTCCAAATTTTTGGAAA and 5\u0001-AGCTTTTCCAAAAATTTG-\nGACAATTATCCTGCATCTCTTGAATGCAGGATAATTGTCCAAAGGG-3\u0001\nwere annealed and phosphorylated in vitro and cloned into the BglII\/HindIII site of\nthe pSUPER plasmid (OligoEngine, Seattle, WA). The oligonucleotide-dimer targets\nthe bases 595\u2013613 of the Nesprin-2\/NUANCE ABD (accession number AF435011)\nand allows the silencing in human and mouse as well as COS7 (African green\nmonkey) cells. The plasmid was transfected into COS7 cells by standard transfection\nmethods.\nImmunoprecipitation of Nesprin-2 and Emerin\nSubconfluent HaCaT cells were harvested and lysed in immunoprecipitation\nbuffer (50 mM Tris\/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5%\nsodium deoxycholate, and protease inhibitors). The cell lysates were centri-\nfuged at 12,000 \u0003 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C, and the supernatants were precleared\novernight with Protein A Sepharose. Lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 \u0003 g\nfor 10 min, and the supernatants were mixed with the indicated antibodies\n(100 \u0002l hybridoma tissue culture medium) and incubated for 2 h at 4\u00b0C.\nProtein A Sepharose was added to the lysates and the samples were incubated\nat 4\u00b0C on a rocking platform. The immunocomplexes were washed three\ntimes and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with the indicated\nantibodies.\nAntibodies and Immunofluorescence Microscopy\nThe GST-K1 fusion protein was used for generating a mouse mAb (mAb\nK49\u2013260) and a rabbit polyclonal antibody (pAb K1; Pineda, Berlin, Ger-\nmany). All polyclonal Nesprin-2 and Nesprin-1\/Enaptin antibodies used\nwere purified by affinity chromatography.\nImmunofluorescence studies were performed as described (Zhen et al.,\n2002). The following antibodies were used: mouse anti-Nesprin-2 mAb K20-\n478 (undiluted, Zhen et al., 2002), mouse anti-Nesprin-2 mAb K49\u2013260 (un-\ndiluted), affinity-purified rabbit anti-Nesprin-2 pAb K1 (1:50), affinity-purified\nrabbit anti-Nesprin-1\/Enaptin (1:50), mouse anti-lamin A\/C (1:50, JoL2,\nChemicon, Temecula, CA), rabbit anti-lamin A (1:30, Cell Signaling Technol-\nogy, Beverly, MA), mouse anti-lamin A (1:40, JoL4), mouse anti-lamin B (1:40,\nLN42, kind gift from Frans Ramaekers and Jos Broers), mouse anti-emerin\n(1:50, Novacastra Laboratories, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom),\nmouse anti-LAP2\u0003 (1:100, BD Biosciences), goat polyclonal anti-GST antibody\n(Amersham Biosciences), mouse anti-GFP antibody mAb K3-184-2 (undi-\nluted, Noegel et al., 2004) and anti-\u0003-tubulin (1:100, WA3, gift from Dr.\nEuteneuer), and rat a6\u00034 integrin antibody (1:50, gift of Dr. Niessen). Second-\nary antibodies for indirect immunofluorescence analysis were conjugated\nwith Cy3 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), FITC (Sigma), Alexa488 (Molecular Probes,\nEugene, OR) and Cy5 (Chemicon). F-actin was detected with FITC-labeled\nphalloidin (Sigma), and nuclear staining was visualized with the DNA-\nspecific dye DAPI (Sigma). Specimens were analyzed by wide-field fluores-\ncence microscopy (DMR, Leica, Heidelberg, Germany) or confocal laser scan-\nning microscopy (TCS-SP, Leica).\nImmunogold Labeling\nCells were fixed in PBS, pH 7.4, containing 3% paraformaldehyde and 0.5%\nglutaraldehyde for 1 h, washed twice in PBS, and postfixed in 0.5% osmium\ntetroxide for 30 min. Next samples were dehydrated and embedded in LR\nWhite resin following the instructions of the manufacturer (Polyscience,\nWarrington, PA). Thin sections (50\u2013100 nm) were mounted on Parlodion-\ncoated Cu-grids and incubated two times for 5 min in PBS containing 2%\nbovine serum albumin to block unspecific binding. Next the sections were\nincubated with primary anti-Nesprin-2 antibodies (pAbK1 diluted 1:100 in\nblocking buffer, mAb K20-478 diluted 1:50 and mAb K49\u2013260 undiluted) for\n2 h (pAbK1 and mAb K20-478) and 6 h (K49\u2013260), respectively.

(A) Structural features of\nknown Nesprin-2 isoforms. Nesprin-2 Giant\/NUANCE consists of an N-terminal actin-binding domain (ABD), followed by several spectrin\nrepeats (ovals) and a C-terminal transmembrane domain (black bar). Epitopes and the identity of various Nesprin-2 antibodies used in this\nreport are indicated (inverted Y). (B and C) COS7 cells were transiently transfected with various C-terminal Nesprin GFP-fusion proteins. The\nCOS7 cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-GFP\u2013specific monoclonal antibodies to demonstrate expression of fusion\nproteins (top panels in B and C). Bottom panels in B and C, immunoblot analysis of the same COS7 lysates using the newly generated C-terminal\npolyclonal (pAb K1) and the mouse monoclonal Nesprin-2 (mAb K49-260) antibodies, verifies their specificity to the Nesprin-2 protein.

(E and F) COS7, HaCaT, and mouse embryonic C3H\/10T1\/2 cell homogenates were\nseparated on 3\u201315% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels and blotted (Padmakumar et al., 2004). Western blot analysis using the N-terminus specific\nNesprin-2 antibody mAb K20-478 and the newly generated C-terminal Nesprin-2 antibodies mAb K49\u2013260 and pAbK1, demonstrate the presence\nof the large 800-kDa Nesprin-2 isoform in COS7 and HaCaT cells. Nesprin-2 expression was not detected in C3H\/10T1\/2 fibroblast lysates. The\nblots shown in E originate from the same gel. The same blot was reprobed with anti-\u0003-tubulin antibodies to illustrate equal loading.

After rinsing with PBS\nand distilled H2O, samples were stained with 6% uranyl acetate for 1 h and\nlead acetate for 2 min and viewed in a LEO 910 transmission electron\nmicroscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).\nRESULTS\nGeneration and Characterization of C-terminal Nesprin-2\nAntibodies\nNesprin-2 is encoded by a highly complex gene giving rise\nto several splice variants. Figure 1A provides a summary of\nthe salient features predicted by computer analysis of all\nknown isoforms generated by the Nesprin-2 locus. We have\npreviously used an mAb directed against the ABD of human\nNesprin-2 Giant\/NUANCE isoform (mAb K20-478), which\nat the subcellular level stained the outer nuclear membrane\n(Zhen et al., 2002). To allow a thorough examination and\ndistinction of the various Nesprin-2 isoforms, we raised\npolyclonal and monoclonal antibodies against the last two\nC-terminal spectrin repeats of human Nesprin-2 (GST-K1,\nsee Figure 3B). For a careful characterization of the antibod-\nies we transiently transfected COS7 cells with various GFP\nfusion constructs harboring the C-terminal segments of Ne-\nsprin-1 and -2 (Figure 1D). Immunoblot analysis of the var-\nious COS7 cell lysates using anti-GFP antibody revealed for\nthe GFP fusions the expected molecular masses (top panel of\nFigure 1, B and C). Concomitant Western blot analysis of the\nCOS7 cell lysates demonstrated that both the polyclonal\n(pAbK1; bottom panel of Figure 1B) as well as the monoclo-\nnal Nesprin-2 antibodies (mAb K49\u2013260; bottom panel of\nFigure 1C) reacted specifically with the Nesprin-2 GFP fu-\nsions and did not cross-react with the highly homologous\nNesprin-1 protein. In addition, none of the C-terminal\u2013di-\nrected Nesprin-2 antibodies recognized the dnNesprin-1 fu-\nsion in transiently transfected mouse embryonic C3H\/\n10T1\/2 cells (Figure 1, G\u2013J). As shown in Figure 1, E and F,\nC3H\/10T1\/2 cells do not express Nesprin-2. Similar to mAb\nK20-478, both mAb K49\u2013260 and the affinity-purified pAbK1\nantibody recognized a major band of enormous size, \u0004800\nkDa (Nesprin-2 Giant), in COS7 and HaCaT cell lysates\n(Figure 1, E and F). The C-terminal\u2013specific antibodies de-\ntected consistently additional bands migrating at \u0004400 and\n76 kDa in HaCaT lysates (Figure 1F, asterisks). The presence\nof the smaller N-terminally truncated Nesprin-2 isoforms in\nHaCaT cells was further strengthened by performing immu-\nnoprecipitation studies (see Figure 8D). The additional\nbands (\u0005400 kDa) observed in COS7 cells were not always\ndetectable; therefore, they may represent degradation prod-\nucts of NUANCE or cross-reactive proteins.\nTo evaluate the specificity of the Nesprin-2 antibodies\nfurther, we examined HaCaT cells by immunofluorescence\nmicroscopy (Figure 2, A\u2013L). All three Nesprin-2 antibodies\ndisplayed a similar pattern and stained specifically the nu-\nclear envelope (Figure 2, A\u2013F). Interestingly, even the stain-\ning patterns of the pAbK1 and K20-478 antibodies were\nidentical (see inset in Figure 2F), which is surprising consid-\nering that more than 6000 aa separate the two epitopes.\nFurthermore, coimmunolocalization studies using lamin\nA\/C and emerin antibodies demonstrated a consistent over-\nlap of these nuclear envelope proteins with Nesprin-2 (Fig-\nures 2, G\u2013L).\nThe C-terminus of Nesprin-2 Interacts In Vivo and in GST\nPulldown Experiments with Lamin A\/C\nA previous study by Mislow et al. (2002b) reported that the\nlast three C-terminal spectrin repeats of nesprin-1\u0001 bind\ndirectly to lamin A in vitro. Because this domain shares 46%\nsequence identity and 59% homology with the C-terminus of\nNesprin-2 Giant\/NUANCE, we examined whether Ne-\nsprin-2 also binds to lamins, using the yeast two-hybrid\nsystem. Yeast cells which were cotransformed with plasmids\nexpressing the GAL4 DNA-binding domain fused to a C-\nterminal fragment of Nesprin-2 composed of the last four\nspectrin repeats (aa 6146\u20136799), and the GAL4 activation\ndomain fused to lamin A grew on selection media and\ninduced the \u0003-galactosidase (Figure 3A). The yeast two-\nhybrid plasmids did not autoactivate the LacZ reporter\ngenes themselves upon transformation into the Y190 yeast\nstrain, demonstrating that Nesprin-2\u2019s C-terminus interacts\nin vivo specifically with lamin A. To verify the observations\nmade in yeast, GST pulldown experiments were conducted\nusing two GST-Nesprin-2 fusion proteins: GST-K1 (spectrin\nrepeats 21 and 22) and GST-SR (spectrin repeats 19\u201322;\nFigure 3B). Equal amounts of recombinant proteins were\nimmobilized on glutathione-agarose beads (Figure 3C, top\npanel) and incubated with COS7 total cell lysates. Using\nimmunoblot analysis, lamin A\/C was found to interact spe-\ncifically with GST-SR but not with GST-K1 alone (Figure 3C,\nbottom panel).\nNesprin-2 Interacts Directly with the Common C-terminal\nRegion of lamins A and C In Vitro\nTo investigate the Nesprin-2-lamin A\/C-interaction in more\ndetail we performed additional in vitro studies. Direct bind-\ning of Nesprin-2 to lamin A\/C was analyzed in a blot\noverlay assay. Lamin A was fused to GST and its expression\nin E. coli was verified by Western blot analysis using the\nanti-lamin A\/C antibody JoL2 (Figure 4A, right panel). Be-\ncause most of the lamin A fusion protein was insoluble, we\nperformed our experiments using the crude bacterial lysates.\nGST, uninduced E. coli cell lysate, and bacterial lysate con-\ntaining GST-lamin A (Figure 4A, left panel) were blotted\nonto a nitrocellulose membrane and incubated with recom-\nbinant GST-SR protein. Immunodetection with mAb K49\u2013\n260 gave a signal corresponding to the size of the GST-lamin\nfusion protein, suggesting that the C-terminal region of Ne-\nsprin-2 binds directly to lamin A (Figure 4B).\nThe LMNA locus codes for four proteins: lamin A, lamin\nC, lamin A\u000610, and the testis-specific lamin C2, which are\ngenerated through alternative splicing.

We found that lamin C coil2 (aa 243\u2013387)\nand lamin C tail (aa 384\u2013566), which are contained within\ndelta-lamin C (aa 128\u2013572) were able to coprecipitate Ne-\nFigure 2 (facing page).

This finding is\ncompatible with two independent Nesprin-2\u2013binding do-\nmains within lamin A\/C. The different binding affinities\nobserved for lamin C coil2 and lamin C tail compared with\ndelta-lamin C may be due to differences in folding.\nThe Localization of Nesprin-2 at the Nuclear Envelope\nDepends on the Lamin A\/C Network\nTo pursue the interaction of Nesprin-2 and lamin A\/C in\nvivo, we transiently expressed the mutant Xenopus lamin\nB1\u00062 in COS7 cells. This mutant protein has been previ-\nously shown to redistribute specifically A-type lamins\nfrom the lamina to nucleoplasmic granules in mammalian\ncells (Ellis et al., 1997; Vaughan et al., 2001; Figure 5, A\u2013D).\nIn transfected cells Nesprin-2 was located primarily in the\nlamin A\u2013positive nucleoplasmic aggregates rather than at\nthe nuclear envelope (Figure 5, E\u2013H). A similar pattern\nwas also evident for Nesprin-1, which no longer localized\nat the nuclear membrane in transfected cells (Figure 5,\nI\u2013L). In agreement with what has been reported earlier\n(Vaughan et al., 2001), the distribution of other nuclear\nenvelope components such as lamin B and LAP2\u0003 re-\nmained unaffected and were retained exclusively at the\nnuclear envelope (Figure 5, M\u2013P and Q\u2013T, respectively).\nThe mechanism, however, by which membrane-anchored\nproteins such as Nesprin-1\/Nesprin-2 are being translo-\ncated to those intranuclear aggregates is unclear. To fur-\nther investigate the relationship between Nesprins and\nlamin A\/C, we investigated the localization of the Ne-\nsprin proteins in lamin A\/C knockout fibroblasts (Figure\n6; Sullivan et al., 1999). Lamin A\/C knockout fibroblasts\nharbor dramatic nuclear morphology changes and defects\nin nuclear structure (Sullivan et al., 1999; Nikolova et al.,\n2004) as well as mislocalization of various components of\nthe nuclear envelope such as emerin. In wild-type fibro-\nblasts the Nesprin-2 staining was confined to the nuclear\nenvelope (Figure 6A), knockout cells, however, showed\nan aberrant cytoplasmic localization (Figure 6C). Similar\ndata were obtained also for Nesprin-1, which no longer\nlocalized to the nuclear envelope in the lamin A\/C knock-\nout cells (Figure 6G). Emerin was used in our studies as a\ncontrol, because its localization is known to be altered in\nlamin A\/C\u2013 deficient fibroblasts (Sullivan et al., 1999; Fig-\nure 6, F and H). Furthermore, the knockdown of lamin\nA\/C using RNAi primers in A431 keratinocytes resulted\nin the mislocalization of the endogenous emerin and Ne-\nsprin-2 proteins to the cytoplasm (unpublished data). In\nsummary, our findings demonstrate that both Nesprin-2\nas well as Nesprin-1 depend on the lamin A\/C network\nfor proper nuclear envelope localization.\nIn Skin, Lamin C Is Sufficient for the Proper Nuclear\nEnvelope Localization of Nesprin-2\nTo learn more about the lamin A\/C\u2013 dependent localiza-\ntion of Nesprin-2, we continued our studies in skin. Skin\nis a stratified epithelium, where the lamin A and lamin C\nisoforms are differentially expressed (Venables et al.,\n2001). Using three different Nesprin-2 antibodies, we\ndemonstrate that Nesprin-2 is present in all living layers\nof the epidermis, localizing to the nuclei of the epithelial\ncells including the basal layer (Figure 7, A\u2013C). Staining\nwas strongest in epidermal keratinocytes, although weak\nnuclear staining was also observed for dermal fibroblasts\n(Figure 7, D and G, arrowheads). In contrast to lamin C,\nFigure 3. (A) The Nesprin-2SR fragment (aa 6146\u20136799) was fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain, whereas lamin A and B1 sequences\nwere linked to the Gal4-activating domain.

(C) Immunoblotting\nusing the C-terminus\u2013specific Nesprin-2 mAb K49-260 demonstrates that equal amounts of the GST fusion proteins were used (top panel).\nCOS7 cell lysates were incubated with the immobilized GST-fusion proteins. The bound proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by\nWestern blot analysis using lamin A\/C\u2013specific antibodies (bottom panel). As a control we used a COS7 total cell lysate.\nT. Libotte et al.\nMolecular Biology of the Cell3416\nwhich is present in all layers of the epidermis including\nthe basal layer (Figure 7E), lamin A is found only in few\nsuprabasal epithelial cells (Figure 7H, arrows) and dermal\nfibroblasts (Figure 7H, arrowheads). Note that keratino-\ncytes that lack lamin A staining (insets of Figure 7, H and\nI, asterisks) still display Nesprin-2 staining at the nuclear\nenvelope (Figure 7I, inset). Similar data were obtained in\nA431 keratinocytes. Even though lamin A is not detectable\nin this cell line using lamin A\u2013specific antibodies (JoL4) in\nimmunofluorescence as well as immunoblotting, Ne-\nsprin-2 is still localizing properly to the nuclear envelope\n(unpublished data). Thus, our cell biological studies sug-\ngest that lamin C is sufficient for proper Nesprin-2 local-\nization at the nuclear envelope.\nExpression of a C-terminal Nesprin-2 Segment Composed\nof the Transmembrane Domain and the Highly Conserved\nPerinuclear Region Displaces Emerin from the Nuclear\nEnvelope of COS7 Cells\nIn a previous study we have shown that the C-terminus of\nNesprin-2 Giant\/NUANCE (dnNesprin-2) is sufficient for\nnuclear envelope localization (Zhen et al., 2002). This con-\nstruct possesses spectrin repeats 21 and 22, the transmem-\nbrane domain and the highly conserved perinuclear seg-\nment of Nesprin-2 Giant. To test the significance of the two\nspectrin repeats in nuclear targeting, we made a shorter\nGFP-fusion protein, tmNesprin-2, that lacks the two spectrin\nrepeats and harbors only the transmembrane domain and\nthe C-terminal tail. Both fusion proteins (dnNesprin-2, tm-\nFigure 4. Nesprin-2 interacts with lamin\nA\/C in vitro.

Thus, the association with the nuclear\nmembrane is not mediated by the spectrin repeats. More-\nover, upon overexpression in COS7 cells both fusion pro-\nteins displaced the endogenous Nesprin-2 proteins from the\nnuclear membrane (Figure 8A, c and o).\nTo address whether the absence of endogenous Nesprin-2\nprotein from the nuclear envelope will affect other compo-\nFigure 5.

(A\u2013T) COS7 cells were tran-\nsiently transfected with a plasmid coding for\nthe dominant negative GFP-lamin B1\u00062\u0002\nprotein and subjected to immunofluores-\ncence. Lamin A\/C is redistributed into the\nGFP-positive nuclear patches in transfected\ncells and is no longer prominent at the nu-\nclear membrane (C). Nesprin-2 (recognized\nby mAb K20-478) redistributes also into these\nGFP positive patches (G; arrowheads),\nwhereas the endogenous protein is localized\nat the nuclear membrane in nontransfected\ncells (G, arrow). A similar pattern is also\nobserved for Nesprin-1 (I\u2013L). In untrans-\nfected cells Nesprin-1 is being found at the\nnuclear membrane (K; arrows), whereas in\ntransfected cells Nesprin-1 colocalizes with\nthe intranuclear GFP-patches (K; arrow-\nheads). Endogenous lamin B and LAP2\u0003\nwere found to be unaffected in transfected\ncells and were retained at the nuclear rim (O\nand S, respectively). DNA was stained with\nDAPI.

Libotte et al.\nMolecular Biology of the Cell3418\nnents of the inner nuclear membrane, we performed indirect\nimmunofluorescence stainings of transfected cells using an-\ntibodies against lamin A\/C and emerin. Although the ap-\npearance and the overall pattern of lamin A\/C at the nuclear\nmembrane was not affected by the overexpression of either\ndnNesprin-2 (Figure 8A, e\u2013h) or tmNesprin-2 (unpublished\ndata) GFP fusion proteins, we found drastic changes in the\nemerin pattern in tmNesprin-2\u2013transfected cells. In sharp\ncontrast to the dnNesprin-2 protein (Figure 8A, i\u2013l), only the\ntmNesprin-2 construct (Figure 8A, q\u2013t) was able to mislo-\ncalize emerin from the nuclear membrane. Emerin displayed\nstrong nuclear staining in untransfected COS7 cells; how-\never, the protein no longer localized to the nuclear mem-\nbrane and accumulated in cytoplasmic granules in 60% of\nCOS7 cells that express tmNesprin-2. Around 5% of trans-\nfected cells did not display any alterations of emerin, and\nanother 35% displayed a partial mislocalization of emerin to\nthe cytoplasm. The numbers provided where obtained by\ncounting 200 transiently transfected cells.\nNesprin-2 Interacts Directly with Emerin In Vitro and in\nHaCaT Cells\nTo examine whether Nesprin-2 and emerin are interacting\nwith each other, we conducted GST pulldown experiments.\nEqual amounts of recombinant proteins were immobilized\non glutathione-agarose beads (Figure 8B, top panel) and\nincubated with COS7 total cell lysates. Using immunoblot\nanalysis, emerin was found to interact specifically with\nGST-K1 (Figure 8B, lower panel). To further investigate\nwhether Nesprin-2 associates directly with emerin, we per-\nformed GST pulldown experiments using recombinant\nemerin protein. Our results show that in contrast to GST,\nGST-K1 specifically interacted with emerin (Figure 8C). Ne-\nsprin-2\u2019s interaction with emerin was further examined in\nvivo by immunoprecipitation using the mAb K49\u2013260 anti-\nbody. This antibody was able to coimmunoprecipitate spe-\ncifically the various Nesprin-2 isoforms and emerin from\nHaCaT cell lysates (Figure 8D). In addition, the immunoblot\nanalysis using the pAbK1 Nesprin-2 antibody on the CoIP\nsamples further underlined the specificity of the C-terminal\nNesprin-2 antibodies.\nAblation of Nesprin-2 Expression in COS7 Cells Using the\nsiRNA Technology Affects the Nuclear Envelope\nLocalization of Emerin\nOur immunofluorescence studies using dominant negative\nNesprin-2 constructs revealed an unexpected relationship\nbetween Nesprin-2 and emerin. The mechanism, however,\nby which those dominant negative Nesprin-2 proteins act\nhas not been studied so far in detail. In addition, the Ne-\nsprin-2 interactions in the perinuclear space have not been\nelucidated at the biochemical level. Therefore it cannot be\nexcluded that the effects on emerin may have been indirect.\nTo unequivocally demonstrate that the emerin mislocal-\nization was caused due to the absence of Nesprin-2, we\nperformed siRNA Nesprin-2 knockdown experiments in\nCOS7 cells. For this purpose, we designed RNA duplexes\nagainst the N-terminus of Nesprin-2 Giant\/NUANCE (see\nMaterials and Methods). We chose for our studies COS7 cells\nbecause they express only the large ABD-containing iso-\nforms and lack the small C-terminal isoforms (see Figure 1,\nE and F) in order to accomplish the complete knockdown of\nFigure 7. In human skin, lamin C is suffi-\ncient for the proper nuclear localization of\nNesprin-2.

COS7 cells were transiently transfected with the\npSUPER plasmid and after 3 d of culturing the cells were\nsubjected to Western blot (Figure 9A) and immunofluores-\ncence analysis (Figure 9, B\u2013J). Lysates of transiently trans-\nfected COS7 cells contained only minor amounts of Ne-\nsprin-2, illustrating the efficacy of Nesprin-2 silencing. In\nsharp contrast, however, lamin A\/C, emerin and tubulin\nlevels were comparable to wild-type (Figure 9A, lower pan-\nels). Confocal microscope analysis of the transfected COS7\ncells revealed that the RNA interference of the N-terminal\nNesprin-2 sequences results in the complete absence of the\nNesprin-2 staining pattern with both N- as well as C-termi-\nnal directed Nesprin-2 antibodies (Figure 9, B and C, aster-\nisks). In many transfected COS7 cells the Nesprin-2 staining\nwas absent from the nuclear membrane and what little\nstaining that remained was cytoplasmic (Figure 9, B, E, and\nH, asterisks). Cells, where Nesprin-2 was absent from the nu-\nclear membrane no longer harbored emerin at the nuclear\nenvelope. Emerin was found primarily in aggregates that were\ndispersed throughout the cytoplasm (Figure 9I, arrowheads).\nTo evaluate the knockdown of Nesprin-2 in COS7 cells,\nwe performed measurements of the fluorescence intensity\nFigure 8.

Libotte et al.\nMolecular Biology of the Cell3420\n(Nesprin-2)\/nucleus size (ImageJ, NIH Image) in cells with\nan abnormal emerin distribution and compare it with cells\nexhibiting proper emerin localization. We found that the\nNesprin-2 fluorescence intensity is reduced by 40% in cells\nwith an abnormal emerin distribution. A paired t test\nshowed that the reduction of fluorescence intensity\/nucleus\nsize (n \b 30, p \t 0001) is significant. By contrast, lamin A\/C\nremained in the nuclear lamina (Figure 9F, arrow).\nTo investigate whether Nesprin-2 distribution was depen-\ndent on emerin, immunofluorescence studies were per-\nformed on dermal fibroblasts null for emerin (Figure 10, A\nand E\u2013G) from patients suffering from X-EDMD caused by\nthe STA g631 del TCTAC mutation (Hoeltzenbein et al.,\n1999). As shown in Figure 10A (top panel), Nesprin-2 is\nexpressed in both wild-type and mutant human dermal\nfibroblasts and represented predominantly by its large 800-\nkDa isoform. Nesprin-2 displayed a strong nuclear envelope\nstaining pattern in wild-type fibroblast cells (Figure 10D,\narrowheads). Although some mutant fibroblasts did exhibit\nincreased cytoplasmic staining for Nesprin-2, the majority of\nthe protein remained at the nuclear envelope (Figure 10G,\narrowheads). Thus, our data strongly suggest that the\nemerin localization to the nuclear envelope in COS7 cells\ndepends on Nesprin-2.\nNesprin-2 Is a Component of the Outer and Inner Nuclear\nMembrane in HaCat Cells\nThe association of Nesprin-2 with inner nuclear proteins\nsuch as lamin A\/C and emerin strongly suggested its pres-\nence within the nucleus. To elucidate the exact Nesprin-2\ntopology at the nuclear membrane we performed immuno-\nelectron microscopy in HaCaT cells using all three Nesprin-2\nantibodies. Prominent immunogold decoration of the NE\nwas observed with all Nesprin-2 antibodies (Figure 11,\nA\u2013C); however, the strongest labeling was observed with the\npAbK1 polyclonal antibody. Nesprin-2 labeling appeared in\nclusters, which were observed on the outer (Figure 11A,\nblack arrows) as well as the inner nuclear membrane (Figure\n11A, open arrowheads). A similar staining pattern was ob-\nserved with the monoclonal N- and C-terminal Nesprin-2\nantibodies (Figure 11, B and C, respectively). Quantitation of\nthe immunogold particles demonstrates that more gold par-\nticles are detected within the nucleus than on the cytoplas-\nmic side of the NE (Figure 11D).\nDISCUSSION\nThe data presented here demonstrate that Nesprin-2 associ-\nates directly both in vitro and in vivo with lamin A\/C and\nFigure 9. The emerin distribution is affected\nin cells where Nesprin-2 expression has been\nsilenced by siRNA. (A) COS7 cells were tran-\nsiently transfected with the pSUPER plasmid\nexpressing RNA duplexes against the N-ter-\nminus of Nesprin-2. Cell lysates were sub-\njected to Western blot analysis using Ne-\nsprin-2 (pAbK1), lamin A\/C, emerin and\ntubulin antibodies, illustrating the efficiency\nof the Nesprin-2 knockdown. The distribu-\ntion of Nesprin-2 (B, E, and H; using pAbK1\nand C; using K20-478), lamin A\/C (F), and\nemerin (I) was investigated by indirect im-\nmunofluorescence in knockdown Nesprin-2\nCOS7 cells (indicated by an asterisk). In knock-\ndown Nesprin-2 cells, lamin A\/C remained at\nthe nuclear envelope (F, arrow), whereas\nemerin was dispersed in cytoplasmic aggre-\ngates (I; arrowheads).

These findings are consistent with previous reports\nregarding Nesprin-2\u2019s homologue Nesprin-1. Mislow et al.\n(2002b) showed that nesprin-1\u0001, a C-terminal isoform of\nNesprin-1 Giant\/Enaptin, interacts directly with emerin and\nlamin A in vitro. In sharp contrast to emerin, which is not\nrequired for the proper subcellular distribution of Ne-\nsprin-2, the selective alteration and ablation of the lamin\nA\/C network has profound effects on the nuclear envelope\nlocalization of Nesprin-2. Our biochemical observations and\nimmunohistochemical data on skin suggest that lamin C is\nsufficient for Nesprin-2 binding and its proper localization at\nthe nuclear envelope. These data are in agreement with a\nrecent report, in which human fibroblasts that carry the\nhomozygous missense mutation Y259X in lamin A\/C ex-\nhibit an aberrant nesprin-1\u0001 and emerin localization. Inter-\nestingly, the expression of lamin C in the mutant cells was\nsufficient to restore the proper anchorage of both emerin and\nnesprin-1\u0001 at the nuclear envelope (Muchir et al., 2003).\nThe scaffolding aspects of lamin in relation to Nesprin-2\nseem to be evolutionarily conserved and have been also\nreported in C. elegans. The localization of ANC-1 in C. elegans\nat the nuclear envelope requires lamin and also the inner\nnuclear membrane protein UNC-84 (Lee et al., 2002; Starr\nand Han, 2002), suggesting a bridging model in which the\nouter nuclear membrane protein ANC-1 interacts through a\n\u201cstructural bridge\u201d composed of UNC-84 and associated\nproteins with the nuclear lamina (Starr and Han, 2003).\nInterestingly two UNC-84 orthologues, SUN1 and SUN2,\nhave been identified in humans (Malone et al., 1999; Hodzic\net al., 2004). Their presence suggests that an indirect anchor-\nage mechanism to the nuclear lamina may exist also for\nNesprins localized at the outer nuclear membrane in addi-\ntion to the direct interaction demonstrated here.\nAlthough the biochemical details regarding the proteins\nimplicated in such a model are still missing, our data pro-\npose that lamin A\/C mutations may disrupt the localization\nand function of Nesprin-2 at the nuclear envelope. Muta-\ntions in human lamins cause a variety of disorders affecting\nvarious tissues including skeletal muscle (Burke and Stew-\nart, 2002; Hutchison, 2002; Worman and Courvalin, 2002).\nInterestingly, both Nesprin-1 as well Nesprin-2 isoforms are\nexpressed in skeletal muscle and genetic data from D. mela-\nnogaster indicate a requirement of the fly orthologue MSP-\n300 in embryonic muscle morphogenesis (Rosenberg-Has-\nson et al., 1996). Therefore, lamin mutations may weaken or\ndisrupt the interactions with Nesprins, resulting in loss-of-\nfunction mutants. Further data will be needed to prove an\ninvolvement of Nesprin-1 and -2 in laminopathies.\nOur results suggest a novel Nesprin-2\u2013based mechanism\nby which emerin is properly localized to the nuclear mem-\nbrane. The observation, however, that the dominant nega-\ntive tmNesprin-2 construct or the Nesprin-2 silencing mis-\nlocalizes emerin is very surprising, considering that emerin\nis able to bind by itself to various nuclear proteins, including\nlamin A\/C (Bengtsson and Wilson, 2004). How does the\nabsence of Nesprin-2 from the nuclear envelope influence\nemerin in cells exhibiting a normal expression and localiza-\ntion of lamin A\/C? One possible scenario is that Nesprin-2\nrecruits and stabilizes emerin at the nuclear envelope\nthrough a direct interaction, a scenario, which is substanti-\nated by our results showing a direct association of the last\ntwo C-terminal spectrin repeats of Nesprin-2 with emerin.\nFigure 11. Immunogold EM examination of\nNesprin-2. In HaCaT cells pAbK1 (A), mAb\nK20-478 N-terminal (B) and mAb K49\u201320 C-\nterminal Nesprin-2\u2013specific antibodies (C)\nrecognize nuclear (open arrowheads) as well\nas cytoplasmic (black arrows) Nesprin-2 pro-\ntein at the NE.

All scale bars, 100 nm.\nT. Libotte et al.\nMolecular Biology of the Cell3422\nOur model is further strengthened by the data we obtained\nfrom the expression of the dnNesprin-2 GFP-fusion protein\nin COS7 cells. In contrast to tmNesprin-2, this polypeptide\ncontains the last two C-terminal spectrin repeats, which bind\nto emerin in vitro. Although both proteins can displace\nNesprin-2, a profound effect on emerin is only observed\nwith the tmNesprin-2 construct where the emerin binding\nsite is missing. Interestingly, such an interaction has also\nbeen described for the C-terminal spectrin repeats of ne-\nsprin-1\u0001. Although the amino-terminal half of nesprin-1\u0001\n(spectrin repeats 1\u20135) was found to bind with high-affinity to\nemerin (53 nM), a week association (250 nM) to emerin was\ndemonstrated for the last three spectrin repeats (spectrin\nrepeats 5\u20137) of the nesprin-1\u0001 molecule (Mislow et al.,\n2002b). Furthermore, our data provide a clear explanation\nfor a previous study, which demonstrated that dominant\nnegative mutants of lamin A\/C cause emerin to accumulate\nin cytoplasmic granules (Vaughan et al., 2001). The authors\nconcluded that lamin A\/C is essential for anchorage of\nemerin to the inner nuclear membrane. Our experiments\nshowed that in addition those constructs affect also the\nlocalization of Nesprins at the nuclear envelope, suggesting\nthat this event may lead to the accumulation of emerin in the\ncytoplasm. Even though much has been reported about the\nnuclear-membrane targeting determinants of emerin and its\nmultiple binding partners, the exact mechanism still remains\nunclear (Fairley et al., 1999; O\u00a8stlund et al., 1999; Tsuchiya et\nal., 1999; Lee et al., 2001). Interestingly, emerin was recently\nidentified as a pointed-end actin-capping protein (Holaska et\nal., 2004). Therefore, emerin and Nesprin complexes may be\ninvolved additionally in the assembly and the organization\nof nuclear actin structures.\nIn a recent study, Zhen et al. (2002) using digitonin extrac-\ntion methods reported the presence of Nesprin-2 Giant\/\nNUANCE at the outer nuclear membrane but also in the\nnucleus. Here, we showed that Nesprin-2 localizes also to\nthe inner nuclear membrane. This suggests that the Ne-\nsprin-2 and the orthologous Nesprin-1 proteins function\nboth inside and outside the nucleus, enabling them to act as\nmolecular bridges connecting the cytoskeleton with the nu-\nclear matrix, intranuclear actin, and spectrin-associated pro-\nteins such as members of the 4.1 protein superfamily (Figure\n12). Indeed immunogold labeling analysis of nesprin-1 in\nmyoblast cells demonstrated its presence at the nuclear en-\nvelope and also within the nucleus, where it colocalized\nwith regions of heterochromatin (Zhang et al., 2001). Current\nmodels, would favor the presence of the smaller N-termi-\nnally truncated isoforms within the inner nuclear mem-\nbrane, whereas the bigger ABD-containing isoforms would\npreferentially be components of the outer nuclear membrane\n(Soullam and Worman, 1995). The presence, however, of the\ngiant ABD-containing isoforms at the inner nuclear mem-\nbrane suggests that alternative sorting mechanisms other\nthan the known lateral diffusion through the nuclear pores\nmust exist to establish such a localization.\nIn closing, our present study establishes linkages and\ninterconnections between Nesprins, lamin A\/C, and the\nemerin molecules (Figure 12), which have been implicated in\na wide range of tissue-specific diseases. Genetic data using\nthe embryonic stem cell technology will shed some light on\nthe potential involvement of Nesprins in human genetic\ndiseases and reveal whether they correspond to the \u201cbiolog-\nical Atlas\u201d of the cell holding up and keeping the nucleus\n(universe) in position. One aspect is, however, already ap-\nparent: eukaryotic nuclei use giant scaffolding proteins that,\nsimilar to cytoplasmic linkers, have the capacity to cross-\nbridge various architectural elements and structurally orga-\nnize membranes. With an 800-kDa Nesprin-2, or an 1-MDa\nNesprin-1 protein there is still much to learn about the\nputative interactions and their biology. Revealing their func-\ntion remains a great challenge since they are the largest\nmolecules of the \u0001-actinin superfamily and of complex struc-\ntural organization.\nNote added in proof. While this paper was under review,\nZhang et al. (2005) published an article demonstrating the\nexistence of various Nesprin-2 isoforms within the nucleus,\nthe outer nuclear membrane, and various cytoplasmic com-\npartments. These data suggest that nesprin-2 isoforms may\nlink various membranous compartments including the nu-\ncleus to the actin cytoskeleton. The authors showed that the\nsmaller Nesprin-2 isoforms colocalize and bind to lamin\nA\/C and emerin at the inner nuclear membrane and require\nlamin A\/C for proper localization in SW-13 cells. Those\nassociations allowed the authors to suggest that a Nesprin-\nbased mechanism may explain how disruption\/s of NE\nconstituents leads to muscle dysfunction.\nFigure 12.
