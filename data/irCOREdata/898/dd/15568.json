We demonstrate the effects and role of anisotropy and particle size distributions upon the \nvalues of constitutive parameters determined from experimental M(H) loops of single domain \nnanoparticle systems. We employ experimental and magnetic material parameters as inputs to a \nnumerical programme run from a graphical user interface (GUI) to permit modelling and \ninterpretation of experimental data and assessment of the stability of the constitutive parameters so \nderived and characterisation of the departures observed from pure Langevin behaviour. \n \n1. Introduction: \nModelling of the field, H, and temperature, T, dependent variation of magnetisation, M(H,T), and \nsusceptibility,  \u03ba(H,T), has been used extensively to gain insight into the fundamental magnetic \nbehaviour of fine particle systems. Candidate systems embrace amorphous or thin film nanoparticles, \nsuperparamagnetic (SPM) single domain (SD) particles, colloids and magnetic fluids, pseudo-single \ndomain (PSD) geogenic materials, and environmental sediments used in source apportionment, the \nestablishment of temporal or climatic proxies and diagenetic processes. Parametric and constitutive \nparameters such as initial susceptibility, \u03bai, saturation, Ms, and remanent, Mr, magnetisation, coercive, \nHc, and remanent coercive, Hr, fields and their ratios (e.g. Mr\/Ms) and temperature dependence derived \nfrom M(H,T) and \u03ba(H,T) are employed in magnetic granulometry to determine particle distribution \nparameters V and \u03c3  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] in turn used to interpret magnetic behaviour [7, 8]. There is \nhowever interdependence in the values of Ms,  K,  V and \u03c3 determined from M(H,T) and \u03ba(H,T). \nReliability of the latter is important as they are used to gain understanding of magnetic behaviour and \neffects [9]. The effect of K [10, 11], V and \u03c3 upon the behaviour and interpretation of SD and SPM \nsystems has been of interest for some time, studied using graphical techniques [12] or restricted cases \n[13].  \n \n2. Experimental Method \nWe employ numerical solutions using experimental parameters K, T, Hc, Ms, \u03ba(H), V, \u03c3 as inputs to a \nGraphical User Interface (GUI) to model experimental data and assess the stability of derived \nmagnetic parameters and determine the effects of K and size distributions upon the values of \nconstitutive parameters determined from experimental M(H) loops. We consider assemblies of SD \nparticles above their blocking temperature i.e. of zero coercivity. Where the energy of an assembly of \nSD particles of saturation magnetisation, Ms, volume, V, and moment m = MsV depends solely upon \nthe applied field, \u00b50B, the magnetisation may be determined analytically from the probability, \u03a0B, that \nInstitute of Physics Publishing Journal of Physics: Conference Series 17 (2005) 1\u20136\ndoi:10.1088\/1742-6596\/17\/1\/001 Fifth International Conference on Fine Particle Magnetism\n1 \u00a9 2005 IOP Publishing Ltda magnetic moment will occupy a thermally populated Zeeman energy state, EB, determined by the \nfield to thermal energy ratio,  ) \/ exp( ) \/ exp( kT B m kT EB B \u22c5 = \u221d \u03a0 .

Restricted classes of the Brillouin  function such as the tanh \nfunction, T(x), are normally only anticipated for monodispersed systems in the presence of dominant \nnegative uniaxial anisotropy and coaxial easy axis alignment. Although our approach is generic we \nhave applied it in particular to colloidal materials and environmental sediments and source \napportionment. \n \n3. Results and discussion \nThe effect of the particle size distribution upon magnetisation curves. We present numerical data for \nM(V,\u03c3) appropriate to Gaussian, PG, triangular, PT, rectangular, PR, and log-normal, PLN, particle \nvolume distributions. Fig.1a contrasts normalised PG,  PT, and PR, particle number volume \ndistributions. The parameter b = m\/kT where m = MsV. The differences between the PG and PT are \nparticularly small. Consequently although M(H) determined by the corresponding moment \ndistributions,  V\u00d7P(V), exhibits larger differences, fig.1b, they may be insufficient to generate \nexperimentally discernable differences in M(H), fig. 2. Similar effects are demonstrated for the log-\nnormal distribution, figs 3 and 4. Comparison of fig.4a and fig.4b shows that the difference between \nPG and PLN for L(x) and T(x) never exceeds 1%. The moment distribution is very similar for the PG and  \n \n \n0\n0.01\n0.02\n0.03\n0.04\n0.05\n0 20 40 60\nTriangular\nGaussian\nRectangular\nVolume parameter b\nP\n(\nb\n, \u03c3\n)\n \n0\n0.01\n0.02\n0.03\n0.04\n0.05\n0 15 30 45 60 75\nRectangular\nGaussian\nTriangular\nbP(b)\nP\n(\nb\nV\n, \u03c3\n)\nFig.1a a.

Only \u03c3LN has been varied and is optimum at 0.39 when the M(H) curves overlay to within 0.2% \nof Ms. As \u03c3  increases \u03bai increases, \u03bah decreases and at high field M(H) converges on the mono \ndispersed curve, an effect that mimics weak to moderate anisotropy, see later. Figs 2 to 5 inclusive \ndemonstrate the weak sensitivity of M(H) to the functional form of the particle volume distribution \nconsistent with the notion that the derivation of volume distributions from magnetisation curves alone \nis ill posed. It is more important to acknowledge that a volume distribution exists than to attempt to \ndefine its functional from magnetic data alone. The dominant effect is that of the intrinsic \nmagnetisation function, L(x) or T(x) even in the presence of a particle size distribution. Hence the \nmagnetisation functional chosen and loop shape exhibited are determined by intrinsic material \nprocesses. We have found that many environmental materials are modelled to high accuracy by either \nmono-dispersed ferri-L(x) plus paramagnetic term, (river bedload sediments), mono-dispersed ferri-\nT(x) plus paramagnetic term (bauxite \/ coral sediments) and have explored possible reasons for this \nbehaviour. \n3 \n0\n10000\n20000\n30000\n40000\n50000\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\nl-norm, Tanh, 30\/0.3\nnorm, Tanh, 30\/10\nl-norm, Lang. 30\/0.3\nnorm, Lang, 30\/10\n\u00b5\n0H (T)\nM\n(\nA\nm\n-\n1\n)\n \n0\n250\n500\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\nL(x) LN(30,0.3) - G(30,10)\nT(x) LN(30,0.3) - G(30\/10)\n\u00b5\n0H (T)\nM\n(\nA\nm\n-\n1\n)\n \nFig.4a.

M(H, \u03c3) difference plots for fig.5a \n \n \nThe effect of magnetic anisotropy upon M(H). Fig.6 indicates the effect of uniaxial anisotropy upon \nthe M(H) curve. For monodispersed systems departures from ideal SPM behaviour occur for R as low \nas 5, where R = KV\/kT, well within the criterion of R<25 values generally accepted as necessary for \nobservation of SPM behaviour. Such departures from SPM can be confused experimentally with, or \nobscured by, the existence of a particle volume distribution. Dependent upon R, medium and high field \nM(H) may depart significantly from pure (K=0) Langevin SPM, (LSPM). For 10 < R< 25 and typical \nexperimental fields and temperature (5< \u00b50bH < 30) significant departures from LSPM behaviour are \nobserved. It is then possible to confuse the presence of strong uniaxial anisotropy with a binary \nmixture of SPM and pure (high temperature) paramagnetic components. This is of importance to \nsediment source apportionment and source unmixing. Whilst the commonly agreed condition of R < \n25 is sufficient for the observation of SPM behaviour it is not sufficient for deconvolution of the \neffects of K and a particle size distribution. The effect of this convolution is most noticeable for \nnegative uniaxial anisotropy, Ku<0, fig.6a, due to both the larger energy barrier to moment rotation \nand restricted number (two) of easy directions, \u0109. Fig.6b demonstrates the effect for Ku>0 where easy \naxes  \u0109 all lie in the basal plane. Consequently the particles possess no energy barrier. For \n4monodispersed systems the initial susceptibility, \u03bai, is independent of K, fig.6a,b. Hence the \u03bai is \neffected by the volume distribution alone. However, as the high field susceptibility, \u03bah = dM\/dH is K \ndependent, particle distribution parameters determined from fitting techniques that use \u03bai and \u03bah, [6] \nand asymptotic linear approach of M(1\/H) to saturation \u03b5Ms as 1\/H \u21920, are prone to over estimate the \ncontribution of small particles. For |K|>0 high values of \u03bah are associated with K, not the presence of \nsmall particles. Such errors are avoided if M(H) is obtained to sufficiently high fields where significant \ndepartures from LSPM(1\/H, K=0) curves will be apparent, fig.7b. In environmental magnetism the \npresence of a significant high or moderate field susceptibility is often viewed as evidence of an \nindependent \u2018paramagnetic\u2019 fraction and employed in source apportionment and fingerprinting. As \nhigh values of \u03bah may be associated with Ku rather than a second phase this assumption should be \ntreated cautiously. This is illustrated in fig.7a where sections of the M(H) curves have been fitted \nemploying three independent parameters, a, b and c to simulate LSPM and independent high field \n\u2018paramagnetic\u2019 phases, i.e.,  cB bB aL M + = ) (  where a = \u03b5Ms, b = m\/kT, c = \u03bah,\/ \u00b50, B = \u00b50H and \u03b5 is \nthe total particle volume fraction. This fitting procedure enables departure from pure Langevin \ndependence due to K and experimental curves to be readily characterised. Applied inappropriately, this \nmethod erroneously interprets the K dependent medium or high field linear variation in M(H) as an \nindependent paramagnetic term causing the particle volume parameter b, to be over-estimated ~70% \nand Ms, parameter a, underestimated by ~40%, table 1. \n \n \n0\n10000\n20000\n30000\n40000\n50000\n0 2 4 6 8 10\n0\n-300\n-625\n-1250\n-2500\n-5000\n-10000\n\u00b5\n0H (T)\nM\n(\nH\n)\n \nk\nA\nm\n-\n1\n0\n10000\n20000\n30000\n40000\n50000\n0 5 10\n0\n300\n625\n1250\n2500\n5000\n10000\nApplied Field \u00b5\n0H (T)\nM\n(\nH\n)\n \nk\nA\nm\n-\n1\nFig.6a The effect of Ku<0 upon the SD M(H) \ncurve, b=10, \u03b5 =0.1 \nFig.6b The effect of Ku>0 upon the SD M(H) \ncurve, b=10, \u03b5 =0.1 \n \n \n \nK (kJ m\n-3) a  (10\n4) b  c  Notes \n0  5.0 (true a)  10 (true b)  0 (true c)  - \n-300 3.43 13.1 10300  fit  to  1T \n-625 2.91 17.1 7500  fit  to  2T \n-1250  2.99 17.1 3600  fit  to  3.5T \n-2500  2.74 17.3 1980  fit  to  10T \n-5000  2.61 19.9 1230  fit  to  10T \n-10000  2.71 16.3 511  fit  to  10T \nTable 1 Result of employing fitting parameters a, b and c when |K|>>0. \n \n \n5 \n0\n25000\n50000\n0 5 10\nK=0\n\u00b5\n0H (T)\nM\n(\nH\n)\n \nA\nm\n-\n1\n25000\n50000\n0 5 10\n-10000\n-5000\n-2500\n-1250\n-625\n-300\n0\nInverse Applied Field 1\/(\u00b5\n0H) (T\n-1)\nM\n(\nH\n)\n \nA\nm\n-\n1\n \nFig.7a Use of three parameter fit to SD M(H) \ncurves with negative anisotropy , computed for \nM(b,\u039a), b=10, K = 0, -300, -625, -1250, -2500, -\n5000, -10000 kJm\n-3, see table 1 \nFig.7b Use of 1\/\u00b50H to estimate Ms, for M(b,\u039a) of \nfig.7a \n \n \n4.
