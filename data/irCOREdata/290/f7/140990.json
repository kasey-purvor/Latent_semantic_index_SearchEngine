The effect\nof different cutout sizes and the design and material of cutout reinforcements on the stress\ndistribution and buckling behaviour of the panels are evaluated.

Conclusions are drawn on the cutout reinforcement design and\nimprovement of stress concentration and buckling behaviour of shear loaded laminated and\nsandwich composite panels with cutouts.\n1. Introduction\nIt is well known that laminated composite materials are increasingly used in aircraft structures\nfor their great potential to achieve structural design tailoring in specific stiffness and strength,\nweight saving and desirable mechanical behaviour against applied loads. However, cutouts\nare often necessary in the construction of aircraft structures for lightening holes, passages for\nwire bundles, hydraulic and fuel pipes, control linkages, accessibility for final assembly and\nmaintenance inspections. In the construction, cutout usages are categorised (Niu, 2001) and\nthe most noticeable feature of cutout for metallic structure is the rounding of the corners to\nprevent excessively high stress concentrations.\nAircraft engineers view cutouts in airframe structures with disfavour because they cause\nreduction in strength and stiffness and the necessary reinforcement increases cost and weight\nto the overall design. In addition, the design of reinforcement is a difficult task since it is a\nproblem area for both static and fatigue strengths and there is insufficient design data\nespecially with regard to composite structures. To ensure structural integrity around a cutout\nin composite structures, two approaches are currently used. Firstly, the thickness of the\nstructural element is increased uniformly across its entire surface such that the resulting stress\nconcentration is no longer a problem but there is a corresponding increase in structural\nweight. Alternatively, the structure may be locally modified with the goal of achieving either\na reduction in the local stress concentration or a minimum possible increase in structural\nstrength. An ideal local reinforcement would result in minimising the mass penalty of overall\n\u2020 Corresponding author (s.guo@cranfield.ac.uk)\n2reinforcement as well as reducing the stresses around the cutout under the same design\nconstraints.\nThe problems of stress concentration and bucking behaviour due to cutouts in laminated\ncomposite plates have been studied by a number of researchers since the early 1970s\n(Greszczuk, 1971; Martine, 1972) and there is an excellent review of research work in these\nareas (Nimesh, 1996). However, there was a need for more studies on shear-loaded composite\npanels with cutouts (Turvey, 1988; Owen, 1990; Britt, 1993) and more comparison with\nexperimental data to substantiate analytical results (Rouse, 1990). Experimental verification is\nalso necessary to provide confidence among structural designers and promote innovative\ndesigns in using composite materials. Since then increasing studies have been conducted on\nthe buckling behaviour of composite plates under combined loadings (Kim, 1996) and cutout\nreinforcements. For example, some authors (Eiblmeier and Loughlan, 1995) investigated the\nbuckling response of a shear-loaded carbon\/epoxy panel with bonded rings for cutout\nreinforcement. In another numerical study of stress concentration and stability of shear-loaded\ncomposite plates (Pandey, 2001), flanged cutout reinforcement adapted from metallic cutout\nreinforcement was designed and analysed. The authors found that the composite plates with\nflanged cutouts could provide significant weight saving in reinforcement design. This type of\nreinforcement has been amenable to numerical simulation, albeit difficult to fabricate in\npractice especially for carbon\/epoxy composite panels. In addition, analytical methods have\nbeen developed for engineering analysis of laminated composite plates with cutouts and\nlimited laminate layups (ESDU- 85001, 86003, 75034 and 80023). Compared with laminated\ncomposite plates, it is noted that much less attention has been paid to the study of cutout\neffect on composite faced sandwich panels (Hadi, 1995).\nThe objective of this paper is to present a study on various cutout reinforcement designs and\ntheir effect on the stress concentration and buckling behaviour of laminated and sandwich\ncomposite panels with cutouts. The shear-loaded panels made of carbon\/epoxy composites\nwith circular cutouts of different sizes have been studied in detail and their results are\ncompared. For the laminated composite panels, the design analysis is focused on local\nreinforcement around the cutouts to reduce the stress concentration as well as to increase the\nbuckling loads with weight consideration. Therefore, these reinforcement types such as rings\nor flanges, which have been widely adopted for metallic structures and had some success with\ncompression-loaded composite plates, are considered for the shear-loaded composite panels.\nFor the sandwich panels, the design analysis deals with buckling and stress concentration\nconcerns in two stages. First the study is focused on obtaining an optimal combination of the\ncomposite face and core thickness for the maximum buckling stability subject to the same\nweight as the laminated composite panel. The study is then focused on reducing the cutout\nstress concentration, which is more of a concern to cutout reinforcement. The scope of this\ninvestigation includes analytical study, numerical simulation using finite element method\n(FEM) and experimental work for modelling validation. Parametric study has been carried out\nas part of the overall investigation. The results of the analysis for the panels subjected to\nconstant stress and constant displacement loading agree very well and their comparison with\nthe experimental results also shows a very good agreement.\n2. Theoretical and Numerical Methods\nSo far there is no theoretical method for an exact solution of stress at the cutout edge of a\ncomposite laminate. However the method developed by Greszczuk (Greszczuk 1971) can\nproduce an elastic stress distribution around the perimeter of a circular cutout in thin\n3homogeneous orthotropic plates under a combination of in-plane loadings. When applied to a\nsingle ply lamina, this method gives an approximate result.\nBased on the theory, the tangential stress \uf073\uf071 at an angular position \uf071 measured from\nhorizontal axis in fibre direction 1 for a fibre reinforced composite ply subjected to a\ncombination of bi-axial and shear stresses is approximated by the following equation\n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\n\uf028 \uf029\uf028 \uf029\uf071\uf067\uf067\uf071\uf067\uf067\n\uf06c\uf074\uf06c\uf073\uf06c\uf073\uf073\n\uf073 \uf071 2cos212cos21\n44\n2\n2\n21\n2\n1\n31222121\n\uf02d\uf02b\uf02d\uf02b\n\uf02b\uf02d\uf02b\n\uf03d (1)\nwhere 1221 ,, \uf074\uf073\uf073 represents the remotely applied ply stresses in direction 1, 2 and shear; and\n\uf028 \uf029\uf028 \uf029\uf028 \uf029\uf071\uf067\uf067\uf067\uf067\uf067\uf067\uf06c 2cos2111 2121211 \uf02d\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf03d ; \uf028 \uf029 \uf071\uf067\uf067\uf067\uf067\uf06c 2cos1 21212 \uf02b\uf02d\uf02b\uf03d ;\n\uf028 \uf029 \uf071\uf067\uf067\uf06c 2sin1213 \uf02d\uf03d\nThe constants in the above expressions are defined as follows\n\uf028 \uf029\uf07b \uf07d\n\uf028 \uf029\uf07b \uf07d 1\/\n1\/\n12\n2\n12\n2\n1\n\uf02b\uf02d\uf02b\n\uf02d\uf02d\uf02b\n\uf03d\nEEAA\nEEAA\n\uf067 ;\n\uf028 \uf029\uf07b \uf07d\n\uf028 \uf029\uf07b \uf07d 1\/\n1\/\n12\n2\n12\n2\n2\n\uf02b\uf02d\uf02d\n\uf02d\uf02d\uf02d\n\uf03d\nEEAA\nEEAA\n\uf067 ; \uf0fa\n\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\n\uf0eb\n\uf0e9\n\uf02d\uf03d 21\n12\n2\n2\n\uf075\nG\nEA\nAccording to Greszczuk, the above method for one ply can be extended to an infinite\ncomposite laminate having a central hole by considering the whole laminate acting effectively\nas a single ply. This can be performed by conducting a coordinate transformation and\nreplacing ply properties by equivalent elastic properties of a laminate.\nTherefore the tangential stress at an angular position \uf061 measured from the horizontal x-axis\nfor a laminate subjected to a combination of bi-axial and shear loading can be expressed by\n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\n\uf028 \uf029\uf028 \uf029\uf061\uf062\uf062\uf061\uf062\uf062\n\uf06c\uf074\uf06c\uf073\uf06c\uf073\uf073\n\uf073 \uf061 2cos212cos21\n44\n2\n2\n21\n2\n1\n321\n\uf02d\uf02b\uf02d\uf02b\n\uf02b\uf02d\uf02b\n\uf03d\nxyyyx (2)\nwhere xyyx \uf074\uf073\uf073 ,, represents the remotely applied in-plane stresses; and\n\uf028 \uf029\uf028 \uf029\uf028 \uf029\uf061\uf062\uf062\uf062\uf062\uf062\uf062\uf06c 2cos2111 2121211 \uf02d\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf03d ; \uf028 \uf029 \uf061\uf062\uf062\uf062\uf062\uf06c 2cos1 21212 \uf02b\uf02d\uf02b\uf03d ;\n\uf028 \uf029 \uf061\uf062\uf062\uf06c 2sin1213 \uf02d\uf03d\nThe constants in the above expressions for Greszczuk\u2019s laminate theorem are defined as\n\uf028 \uf029\uf07b \uf07d\n\uf028 \uf029\uf07b \uf07d 1\/\n1\/\n2\n2\n1\n\uf02b\uf02d\uf02b\n\uf02d\uf02d\uf02b\n\uf03d\nxy\nxy\nEEBB\nEEBB\n\uf062 ;\n\uf028 \uf029\uf07b \uf07d\n\uf028 \uf029\uf07b \uf07d 1\/\n1\/\n2\n2\n2\n\uf02b\uf02d\uf02d\n\uf02d\uf02d\uf02d\n\uf03d\nxy\nxy\nEEBB\nEEBB\n\uf062 ;\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0eb\n\uf0e9\n\uf02d\uf03d yx\nxy\ny\nG\nE\nB \uf075\n2\nIn theory, this method is only valid for a laminate of layup without in-plane coupling between\nthe axial and shear stiffness. It is limited to a symmetric, balanced, especially orthotropic\nlaminate. Based on the assumption of constant strain through the thickness, the cutout\ndiameter should be greater than five times of the laminate thickness. In addition, the distance\nfrom the cutout edge to the plate boundary should be greater than 1.5 times of the cutout\ndiameter for sufficient accuracy. Despite of all these limits, this method provides a useful and\nconvenient tool for predicting an average stress and strain through the thickness of a laminate\n4at its cutout edge. Based on the method, a program has been developed for industrial\napplication (MIL-HDBK, 1998) and it is employed for the analysis in this paper. Some detail\nof the method is available in ESDU 85001 and a computer program based on the method is\navailable in ESDU 86003.\nFor numerical simulation, MSC PATRAN\/NASTRAN as a well developed commercial FEM\ntool has been employed in this investigation for its applicability to such a problem.\n3. Composite Panel Examples and FE Modelling\nIn this paper, three examples from the two types of composite panels have been considered\nfor analysis and experiment.\nExample 1 is a square laminated composite plate of size a = 320 mm and thickness t = 2 mm\nwith a central circular cutout of diameter d varying from 32 to 160 mm as illustrated in Figure\n1. The plate is made of 16-ply carbon\/epoxy prepreg (913C-HTA) with laminate layup\n[(\uf0b145)4]s and material properties listed in Table 1.\nExample 2 is a square sandwich panel of the same dimension and cutout sizes as example 1. It\nis made of two skin faces of 8-ply [(\uf0b145)2]s laminate of the same carbon\/epoxy material as\nexample 1 and an AIREX C71 foam core of properties listed in Table 1. The datum thickness\nof the skin face and the core is 1 mm and 5 mm respectively.\nExample 3 is a square sandwich panel of size a = 280 mm with carbon\/epoxy prepreg (Hexply\nM21\/35%\/268\/T800s) for the faces and a 5 mm thick AIREX C75.71 foam core of properties\nlisted in Table 1. A central circular cutout diameter varies from d=36 to 140 mm. The datum\nthickness of the skin face and core is 2 mm and 5 mm respectively.\nA MSC NASTRAN FE model for the composite laminated plate is created using QUAD4\nshell element in composite laminate type. A mesh density of 2400 elements for the panel\nmodel has been chosen for efficient computation and sufficient accuracy in the subsequent\nlaminate panel analysis since further doubling of the mesh density would only increase the\naccuracy of the stress results by less than 1%. For the sandwich panels, the same shell element\ntype as above is selected for the laminate faces and a HEX-8 solid element type is used for the\ncore model.\n4. Analysis of Laminated Composite Plates with a Central Circular Cutout\n4.1 Cutout Size Effect on the Maximum Stress\nIn order to study the cutout effect on the maximum stress occurring at the cutout edge of a\nshear-loaded composite plate, the example 1 plate is simply supported and subjected to a\nshear load of S=20 N\/mm along all edges of the plate. The MSC.NASTRAN FE numerical\nresults of maximum stress of the panel against a range of cutout size ratio are obtained.\nAlthough the stress results in each layer and different directions have been calculated, only\nthe maximum principle stresses in the fibre direction of 45-degree ply have been plotted in\nFigure 2. It is noted that the maximum principle stress varies almost linearly with (d\/a)2,\nindicating that the stress is approximately proportional to the ratio of the circular cutout area\nto square panel area over the range of cutout sizes considered in this investigation.\n5To compare the FE results with the analytical method in ESDU 85001, the equivalent elastic\nmodulus of the laminate through thickness has been calculated and used in the ESDU\ndatasheet and also used to create a quasi-isotropic FE model. Their resulting normal stress \uf073x\nin x- and \uf073y in y-axis for the plate with a cutout of diameter d = 44 mm (d\/a=0.1375) are\nlisted in Table 2. The tensile and compressive stresses in opposite sign are located at the two\nangular positions A and B around the cutout differing by 90 degrees as shown in Fig.7. In\norder to compare the above stresses with the laminate FE results, an average stress \uf073x is\ncalculated by taking an average value of the stress from all the plies of the laminate. Similarly\nan average stress \uf073y in y-direction is also calculated for the laminate. The laminate FE stresses\nare also in opposite sign at the two angular positions A and B. The laminate FE stresses show\nclearly a better agreement with the ESDU results than with the quasi-isotropic FE model.\nFor larger cutout diameters, the difference in the stress results between the FE model and the\nESDU data is slightly larger than that for d=44 mm. However since the approximate ESDU\ndata does not take the cutout size into account, a poorer agreement between the ESDU data\nand FE results is expected when the cutout diameter increases to higher values.\n4.2 Cutout Size Effect on the Plate Buckling Stability\nAs the cutout size and stress at the cutout edge increase, a reduction in plate buckling stability\nis expected. In the analysis, a buckling load factor (BLF), which is defined as a ratio of\ncritical buckling load of the plate against the applied load is used to present the plate buckling\nstability. For the example 1 laminate plate under a simply-supported (s-s) or clamped\ncondition and a shear load S =20 N\/mm, the buckling load results up to the first five modes by\nFEM have been calculated. It is noted that the BLF for all the modes vary in a similar trend\nagainst the cutout size. The effect of cutout size on laminate stability can be seen by\npresenting the BLF in the first mode against the cutout ratio d\/a as shown in Figure 3. It is\nalso noted that the composite plate buckles when the cutout ratio d\/a approaches 0.3 under the\napplied shear load. For comparison, the value for the laminate plate without cutout, BLF=1.8,\nobtained from ESDU 80023 datasheet is also included in Figure 3 although the result is\napproximate since the ESDU data apply only to a specially orthotropic plate.\n4.3 Cutout Size Effect on Damage Tolerance\nAlthough the fatigue behaviour of laminated composites is generally much better than\nmetallic materials, damage tolerance is a major concern in the design of a laminated\ncomposite structure. To make sure a composite structure has adequate tolerance to impacts\nand manufacture defects, the ultimate strain is normally limited up to 4000 \uf06d\uf065 in aircraft\ndesign. As the stress and strain increase with the cutout ratio, the buckling stability decreases.\nWhen the cutout ratio reaches 0.3 for the simply supported laminate panel, Fig.3 shows a\nresulting BLF=0.91, which indicates the panel buckling under the applied load. However the\nassociated maximum principle stress of 127 MPa is less than 10% of the ultimate stress. It is\nwell below fatigue allowable stress level, hence leads to little crack propagation. On the other\nhand, the maximum normal and shear strain at the cutout edge is 1350 \uf06d\uf065 and 2036 \uf06d\uf065\nrespectively, which is well below the allowable damage tolerance level. Therefore the\nbuckling stability is the primary concern in the current cutout and reinforcement study.\n65. Cutout Reinforcements Analysis using FEM\nFour of the five different types of cutout reinforcements as illustrated in Figure 4 have been\ninvestigated for their effectiveness in reducing stress concentration and improving stability of\nthe example 1 composite plate. These reinforcements include a flanged cutout (Type 1), a\ncomposite ring (Type 2), a flanged cutout plus a composite ring (Type 3) and a double ring on\neach side of the laminate (Type 4).\nTo simplify the presentation, only the maximum principle stress results from cutout diameter\n44 mm (d\/a = 0.1375) and the 1st mode BLF against three different cutout ratios obtained for\nthe composite plate are shown in the following tables for each of four reinforcement types.\nFor easy comparison, all values of stress and BLF tabulated in the Tables 3-6 for the four\ntypes of reinforcement are normalised with respect to their corresponding un-reinforced\nvalues plotted in Figures 2 and 3.\nType 1 \u2013 Flange Reinforcement\nIn the first reinforcement type, the effect of flange angle \uf066 and height h on the maximum\nstress at the cutout edge and the reinforced plate stability has been studied. Table 3 shows that\nthe maximum stress in fibre direction has been reduced by up to 16.5% for composite plate at\nthe cost of adding flange weight equivalent to 1\/3 of the cutout material mass. The results also\nshow that flange reinforcement provides a progressive improvement in stability as cutout ratio\nincreases although the unsymmetrical geometry in z-direction may cause a shear-bending\ncoupling and reduce the reinforcement effectiveness in stability improvement.\nType 2 \u2013 Single Ring Reinforcement\nIn the type 2 reinforcement, a composite ring of the same material and layup as the laminate\nplate but of different widths and thicknesses is added on one side of the laminate plate around\nthe cutout. As shown in Table 4, this reinforcement results in a stress reduction by up to\n18.4%. Overall the plate stability is slightly better with this type of reinforcement compared\nwith type 1 reinforcement. However the reinforcement causes a weight penalty equivalent to\n2.6 times of the cutout material mass and the unsymmetrical geometry in z-direction may also\nreduce the reinforcement effectiveness in improving stability.\nType 3 \u2013 Flange and Ring Reinforcement\nIn the third type, a composite ring of width wr=20 mm and tr=2 mm is added onto the\nlaminate in the opposite side to the flanged cutout of type 2 as shown in Figure 4. This hybrid\nreinforcement results in a reduction of stress by up to 30.3%, as shown in Table 5. The\nreinforcement also provides a much better stability for the plates with the largest cutout, but\nno better for the smaller cutout sizes when comparing with results obtained for reinforcement\ntypes 1 and 2. In addition, a weight penalty equivalent to 2.6 times of the cutout material mass\nis added.\nType 4 \u2013 Double ring reinforcement\nIn the fourth type, reinforcement rings of different sizes and materials may be bonded on both\nsides of the laminated plate around the cutout. When a couple of composite rings same as that\nin Type 2 is used, significantly more reduction in stress at the cutout edge and increase in\nBLF especially for the largest cutout size has been achieved as shown in Table 6 when\ncomparing with results of previous reinforcement types.\nWhen a couple of metallic rings of width wr =15 mm and tr =2 mm are used instead of the\ncomposite rings, more stress reduction can be achieved depending upon the ring materials as\n7shown in Table 7. From the stress comparison of all the reinforcement types shown in Figure\n5 below, it is noted that the metallic ring reinforcement is most effective.\nThe above numerical analysis clearly shows that type 4 double ring reinforcement results in\nthe greatest reduction of stress around the cutout and stability improvement. Regarding the\nring materials, it is noted that the higher the material modulus the more load the ring will\ncarry hence the less stress remains in the laminate near the cutout.\n6. Analysis of composite sandwich panels\nThe analysis for the example 2 composite sandwich panel has also been conducted by using\nFE method. Table 8 shows the maximum stress and the 1st BLF against cutout ratio for the\nexample 1 plate with two selected types of reinforcement designs as well as the example-2\nsandwich panel. Similar to those in Tables 3-6, all values presented in Table 8 except the\nstress in the core are normalised with respect to the maximum stress and BLF values\ncalculated for the original un-reinforced laminated composite plate in example 1.\nThe results in Table 8 indicate that, comparing with the laminated composite plate (example\n1) even with the most effective steel ring reinforcement, the composite sandwich panel\n(example 2) without reinforcement is by far more effective in buckling stability. However a\nlittle increase of the maximum stress and weight raises design concerns although the stress\nincrease is less than 10% and the weight penalty is minimal.\nFurther analysis has been carried out on the composite sandwich panel buckling stability with\na range of combinations of composite face and core thickness while keeping the panel weight\nthe same as the un-reinforced laminated composite plate. The 1st mode BLF results as shown\nin Table 9 indicate three interesting points. Firstly the sandwich panel is more effective\nagainst buckling than the laminated plate of the same weight if the face laminate has 4 or\nmore plies; secondly although there is a face thickness limit below which the sandwich panel\ncould be worse than the laminated plate against buckling, the buckling stability of a sandwich\npanel is not proportional to its composite face thickness; in fact there is an optimal\ncombination of face-core thickness (0.75-13-0.75 mm) for the greatest buckling stability that\nhas been obtained in the analysis. The above results indicate that a proper design for a\nsandwich panel with cutouts will improve the buckling stability significantly without weight\npenalty.\nRegarding the stress however, Table 8 shows that the sandwich offers little advantage to\nreducing the maximum stress at the cutout edge. The stress concentration in the laminated\nface at cutout remains a concern for cutout reinforcement consideration. Table 8 also shows\nthat the maximum von Mises stress in the core is only 0.14 MPa for the cutout ratio 0.5 panel.\nThis is well below the foam material ultimate normal stress of 1.4 MPa and shear stress of 1.0\nMPa. Therefore it is the buckling capability rather than the material or bonding failure that\nconcerns the panel cutout reinforcement design in the current study.\nIn this investigation, a sandwich panel as the example 3 was manufactured and tested with\ndetails given in the next section. In order to use the test data to validate the numerical\nanalysis, a FE model for the sandwich panel has been created to focus on cutout stress\nanalysis. The numerical model is started with a 1 mm composite face with three types of\ncutout reinforcement: a central tube type 5 as illustrated in Figure 4, a single ring and double\nsided rings made of Al-7075 similar to the type 2 and 4 in Figure 4. Subjected to a simply\nsupported condition and a shear load S=20 N\/mm along the edges of the panel, the maximum\nstress results at the cutout edge for three different cutout size ratios and reinforcement types\n8are shown in Figure 6. In this case, the selected reinforcement tube and ring thickness is tr=2\nmm and the ring width is 20 mm.\nFrom the above results, three interesting points are noted. Firstly, similar to the laminated\ncomposite plate, the double ring reinforcement type 4 is the most effective one and the\nmaximum stress can be reduced by over 50% for the three cutout sizes. Secondly a single ring\nreinforcement can also significantly reduce the maximum stress by 12-22% for the different\ncutout sizes; the central tube reinforcement type 5 is very effective for small cutout d\/a=0.13,\nbut much less effective for larger cutouts. Finally, for the example 3 un-reinforced sandwich\npanel having a skin face thickness t=2 mm and cutout diameter d=60 mm, the FE results show\nthat the maximum tensile stress on the laminate surface in \u201345-degree direction is 38 MPa and\nwhen the cutout is reinforced by inserting a central tube of thickness tr=2 mm and depth t=9\nmm, the maximum surface stress in the same position and direction is reduced to 25.5 MPa.\nThe results agree with test data very well as presented in the next section.\n7. Experiment of CFRP Plates with Cutout Reinforcements\n7.1 Test Samples\nTo validate the above FE results, a few reinforcement design cases from the above examples\nhave been selected for experimental tests. For the example 1, three laminated composite plates\nwith circular cutout of diameter d=44 mm and reinforcement types 2 and 4 have been\nmanufactured as test samples 1-4 with details listed in Table 10. For the example 3, two\nsandwich panels having a circular cutout of d=60 mm with and without a central tube\nreinforcement have been manufactured as test samples 5 and 6 as listed in Table 12.\nThe laminate sample was made of 16-ply (913C-HTA) unidirectional prepreg with a stacking\nsequence of [(+45\/-45)4]s and the cutout was made after curing. Both the metallic rings and\nthe CFRP rings were manufactured separately and then bonded to the cured laminated plate\nusing Huntsman Araldite 420 A\/B two component epoxy paste adhesive.\nFor the test samples 1, 5 and 6, four rosette strain gauges were placed close to the cutout edge\nat 45o and 135o from the x-axis on both sides of the plate surface as illustrated in Figure 7. For\nsample 2, rosette gauges of factor 2.11 were located as shown in Figure 8 since it was unable\nto place them near the cutout edge or on the narrow ring on the reinforced back side. For\nsample 3 where CFRP rings were bonded on both sides, all rosette gauges were located\noutside the ring with additional two small strain gauges of size 6mm and gauge factor 1.88\nglued on the ring at an angle of 45o as illustrated in Figure 9a. For test sample 4 however, all\nrosette strain gauges were conveniently placed near the cutout edge on the ring of 15 mm\nwide as shown in Figure 9b.\n7.2 Test Rig and Loading\nA test machine RDP Avery, which may apply loading up to 600 kN was selected. A shear test\nrig made of steel was designed and manufactured as shown in Figure 10. The test rig was\nmounted to the machine at the bottom of the jig. The test sample plate was bolted to the test\nrig along one vertical edge and loaded downward along the opposite edge as shown in Figure\n10. To prevent the laminated composite plate from buckling before the loading reaches 6.4\nkN, which is equivalent to a shear load intensity of 20 N\/mm, the top and bottom edges of the\nplate were reinforced by bolting steel strips on both sides.\n97.3 Test Results and Data Analysis\nThe relationship between measured voltage from the strain gauges and strain \uf065\uf03d\uf020\uf06dx103 is\ngiven by (Eiblmeier, 1996):\n4\n10** 3\uf02d\n\uf03d\n\uf044 \uf065GF\nV\nV (3)\nwhere \uf044V is the differential gauge voltage, V bridge excitation voltage (used 5.0 V), GF is the\ngauge factor, and \uf065 the surface strain experienced by strain gauge.\nAfter a gain of 103 is applied to the test data, the surface strain \uf065 can be expressed as:\nGFV\nV\n*\n4*\uf044\n\uf03d\uf065 (4)\nFrom the measured strains, the stresses at the measurement locations of the test plate can be\ncalculated based on the following equations (ESDU 85001).\n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 yyxxy\nxyx\nx\nyxxy\nx\nx\nEE\n\uf065\n\uf075\uf075\n\uf075\n\uf065\n\uf075\uf075\n\uf073\n\uf02d\n\uf02b\n\uf02d\n\uf03d\n11 (5)\n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 yyxxy\ny\nx\nyxxy\nyxy\ny\nEE\n\uf065\n\uf075\uf075\n\uf065\n\uf075\uf075\n\uf075\n\uf073\n\uf02d\n\uf02b\n\uf02d\n\uf03d\n11 (6)\nSample 1 For the laminate plate without reinforcement, strains against loadings measured at\npoint B are presented in Figure 11. The strains corresponding to loading 6.4 kN, which gives\n20 N\/mm shear force along the edge were recorded and converted to stress \uf073x=76 MPa as\nshown in Table 11. Since the strain measured is actually from the local region a few\nmillimetres away from the cutout edge at point B as illustrated in Figure 7, the FE result taken\nfor comparison should be in the same position. As shown in Figure 12, the stress in that\nregion varies from 72 MPa to 91 MPa and the average is \uf073x=81.5 MPa, which agrees well\nwith the test data. An alternative FE solution based on constant displacement loading\ncondition results in an average stress 72.3 MPa, which gives a slightly better comparison.\nSample 2 For the laminated composite plate with a CFRP ring reinforcement, strains\nmeasured at point D as illustrated in Figure 8 are presented in Figure 13. The strains\ncorresponding to 6.4 kN loading were converted to stress \uf073x= 45.1 MPa as shown in Table 13.\nComparing the measured stress with the corresponding FE results of 40.1 MPa based on\nconstant load and 41.8 MPa based on constant displacement calculation, it is noted again the\nagreement is good.\nSample 3 For the laminate plate with double composite ring reinforcement under the same\nloading 6.4 kN, strains measured at point D (see Figure 9(a)) are shown in Figure 14 and the\nresulting stress are also listed in Table 11. The results also show a very good agreement\nbetween the test data and FE results.\nSample 4 For the laminate plate with steel ring reinforcement, strains measured at point B on\nthe ring (see Figure 9b) are presented in Figure 15. The strains and the resulting stress are also\nlisted in Table 13. The stress on the ring from FE result based on constant shear loading varies\n10\nin the measurement region and the average stress is about 23.7 MPa. The FE stress based on\nconstant displacement is 24 MPa which is also very close to the test data.\nFor the above four test samples, buckling loads from experiment and FE results in simply\nsupported condition as shown in Table 12 also agree very well.\nSamples 5 and 6 The sandwich panel test by applying a shear load up to 11 kN was repeated\nthree times. The strain measurements at point B (see Figure 7) under the shear loading 5.6 kN\n(20 N\/mm) are averaged and converted to a principle stress \uf073p=30.4 MPa for sample 5 and\n\uf073p=20.4 MPa for sample 6 test respectively. On the other hand, the FE results show that the\nmaximum principle stress at the point B measurement region varies from 28 to 38 MPa for\nsample 5 and from 19 to 25 MPa for sample 6. The results in average maximum principle\nstresses of 33 MPa and 22 MPa and only 8.5% and 7.8% differences for samples 5 and 6\nrespectively compared to the test data.\n8. Conclusions\nThe above FE results have shown that the maximum stress and buckling stability are strongly\ninfluenced by the cutout size for both laminated and sandwich composite panels. The\nmaximum principle stress at the cutout edge varies approximately linearly with the area ratio\nof the circular cutout and the plate whereas the buckling load factor varies approximately\nlinearly with the appreciable cutout ratio. It is clear from the present study that an optimal\ncombination of face and core thickness can be determined for a shear loaded sandwich panel\nto gain the maximum buckling stability without weight penalty. However, the sandwich panel\nsuffers similar stress concentration problem for a given cutout ratio comparing to the\nlaminated composite plate. Parametric study carried on the different reinforcement types\nshows that double ring reinforcement is the most effective reinforcement design for both\ncomposite plates and sandwich panels. Further analysis of the double-ring reinforcement type\nwith different ring materials shows that double steel rings can be used to reduce even further\nthe maximum plate stress at the cutout edge albeit with some additional weight penalty. It is\nclear that the most effective means of improving the buckling stability of composite panels\nwithout weight penalty is to employ sandwich design, and the most effective reinforcement\nfor reducing sandwich panel stress concentration at minimum weight cost is the central tube\ndesign.\nComparison of the stress and buckling results between the constant stress and the constant\ndisplacement loaded panels has shown a good agreement. The FE results have been validated\nby experimental test data and the overall agreement between them is very good.\nReferences\n1. Niu, M. C. Y. Airframe Stress Analysis and Sizing, 2nd ed.
