Mitigation policies can also aid adaptation\nby limiting the pace of future sea level rise.\n1 Introduction\nEstimating climate change economic impacts is a difficult task, because of the\ncomplexity of the interface between climate change, society and the world economy.\nThis report illustrates a methodology to estimate economic impacts of climate change\nat city scale, taking the example of sea level rise and storm surge risks in a coastal city.\nClimate change impacts in coastal cities are expected to represent a major challenge\nthis century, with millions of exposed people and thousands of billions of USD of\nexposed assets at the global scale (Hanson et al. 2011, in this volume).\nThe methodology applied in this report is presented in detail in Hallegatte\net al. (2011, in this volume). It is based on a series of steps: (1) a statistical analysis\nof past storm surges in the studied city; (2) a geographical-information analysis of\nthe population and asset exposure in the city, for various sea levels and storm surge\ncharacteristics; (3) an assessment of direct economic losses in case of storm surge\n(i.e. of the damages to buildings and building content), excluding human life losses\nand other intangible direct impacts; (4) an assessment of the corresponding indirect\nlosses\u2014in the form of production and job losses, reconstruction duration, amongst\nother loses\u2014using an adaptive regional input\u2013output model (ARIO, Hallegatte\n2008); (5) a risk analysis of the effectiveness of coastal flood protections, including\nrisk changes due to climate change and sea level rise.\nThis methodology is applied in Copenhagen (K\u00f8benhavn), the capital of Den-\nmark, and the centre of the Swedish-Danish Oresund (\u00d8resund) region. As a low-\nlying city with a significant number of people and amount of property lying close\nto the water level, Copenhagen is potentially vulnerable to the effects of natural\nvariability in sea level and, on decadal timescales, anthropogenic sea level rise.\nThis study explores how storm surge risk might change in the future as a result\nof anthropogenic climate change and the implications for investment in protection\ninfrastructure. In this analysis, all other impacts (e.g., flooding due to heavy precipita-\ntion) are disregarded, and the proposed methodology does not pretend to assess the\ntotal macroeconomic cost of climate change. The basic methodology presented here\nhowever could be extended to assess a range of different impacts areas or sectors.\nConsidering the large uncertainty on future sea level rise (e.g., IPCC 2007;\nRahmstorf 2007; Pfeffer et al. 2008), this analysis is not based on a single sea level rise\nscenario. Instead, several possible amplitudes of sea level rise are considered, from\n0 to 125 cm, and results are presented in all these cases without trying to aggregate\nresults for these various possible futures. This approach allows to account easily for\nany new information on future climate change, to assess the robustness of our results\nand their sensitivity to the amplitude of sea level rise, and to inform the reader on\nsea level rise consequences, regardless of his or her beliefs about future sea level rise.\nThe report begins with an overview of the geography of Copenhagen and es-\ntimates present and future storm surge activity. Section 3 presents an analysis of\nthe exposure of population and assets (residential, commercial, and industrial) to\nsea levels. Section 4 then uses a simplified vulnerability function and an economic\ninput\u2013output model of the Capital Region of Denmark to investigate the potential\nClimatic Change (2011) 104:113\u2013137 115\ndirect and indirect losses for the city, including current protection. To demonstrate\nthe broader applicability of the approach, Section 5 concludes and discusses more\ngeneric adaptation and mitigation options to limit flood risks.\n2 Context\n2.1 Geography of Copenhagen\nCopenhagen (K\u00f8benhavn) is located on the east side of the Danish island of Zealand,\nand partly upon the island of Amager (Fig. 1). The coastline of Copenhagen lies along\nthe Danish Inner Waters and essentially upon the Baltic Sea. Copenhagen is a low-\nlying city, with the highest ground around 45 m above sea level. In terms of total\ninsured value (TIV), most of the assets of Copenhagen are in the residential sector\n(more than 120 billions Euros), while industrial and commercial sectors represent,\nrespectively, about 8 and 50 billion Euros. Agriculture is marginal in the region. In\nspite of its importance, data on infrastructure (especially transport infrastructure)\nwas not available, and simple extrapolation methods had to be used (see Section 4.1).\n2.2 Current variability in sea levels in Copenhagen\nThe low elevation of the city leaves its population and assets potentially exposed to\nvariations in sea level. However, the city\u2019s position upon the Danish Inner Waters\nand Baltic Sea means that it experiences relatively small tidal changes in sea level.\nMore significant changes in sea level are caused by the strong winds in the low-\npressure storm systems that cross the Baltic region during winter. As storms pass\nover the sea, they can create storm surges; low atmospheric pressure and winds\ncause an increase in water levels at nearby coasts that can lead to flooding. Storm\nsurges tend to occur more frequently and intensely along the North Sea coast (i.e.\naway from Copenhagen) than in the Danish Inner Waters. Copenhagen itself is also\nwell protected by the surrounding topography and therefore, storm surge events are\nrelatively rare. However, large surges are not unheard of; the city can be vulnerable\nwhen low pressure systems track northwards over the continent and into the Baltic.\nFig. 1 Schematic view of\nCopenhagen, Denmark\nDanish Inner Waters (Baltic Sea)\nOresund\nIsland of Zealand\n(Sj\u00e6lland)\nIsland of Amager\nCopenhagen\n(K\u00f8benhavn)\n116 Climatic Change (2011) 104:113\u2013137\nFig. 2 Storm surge return\nwater level (cm)\ncorresponding to various\nreturn-periods, up to\n1,000 years.

The largest\nevents in the Copenhagen harbour record occurred in 1902 (154 cm above normal\nsea level) and 1921 (157 cm); no information about flooded areas or damages are\navailable. The largest storm surges in recent history occurred during the winters of\n2006 and 2007 (with recorded water levels of 131 and 142 cm). These events did not\nlead to significant damages in Copenhagen.\nFigure 2 shows the estimated storm surge water level corresponding to various\nreturn periods. Return periods are a measure of frequency; for instance, if the 100-\nyear flood is at 150 cm above normal sea level, it means that there is a 1\/100 =\n1% chance of having a flood higher than 150 cm every year. This analysis uses\nlocal sea level data (1890 to 2007) provided by the Danish Coastal Authority1\n(Kystdirektoratet) and produced by the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI). The\ndata set contains 256 events during which water level was at least 80 cm above\nthe mean sea level. Relative frequencies of high-water events of various amplitudes\nare estimated using a Peak Over Threshold (POT) approach (See Coles 2001). The\nshape parameter of the Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) is found significantly\nlower than 0 with a p value lower than 0.1% (\u03be estimate: \u22120.155 with corresponding\nstandard error 0.05). This implies that the underlying surge distribution is light tailed\nand upper bounded at 2.02 m. According to the analysis presented here, the water\nlevel of the 20\u2212, 50\u2212 and 100-year return-period events are, respectively, 135 cm,\n145 cm and 150 cm (Fig. 2)2. These are slightly lower than the average for the\nDanish Inner Waters. The distribution parameters estimated here are consistent\nwith the statistical analysis performed at the Danish Coast Authority, but may be\nconservative as considerably larger surges predating measurements (e.g. in 1872)\nhave been observed along parts of the Copenhagen coastline.\n1We would like to thank Carlo S\u00f8rensen for his help in obtaining this data.\n2According to these estimates, the water level corresponding to the m-year event is given by:\nrm = u + \u03c3\n\/\n\u03be \u00b7 ((m \u00b7 nobs \u00b7 rate)\u03be \u2212 1),\nwhere u is 80 cm; \u03c3 is 18.91; nobs = 365; rate = 5.53.10\u22123 and \u03be = \u20130.154. This function is plotted in\nFig. 2.\nClimatic Change (2011) 104:113\u2013137 117\nThe risk of coastal flooding in Denmark is relatively low at present. The areas\nworst affected by storm surges on the North Coast are not densely populated and are\nwell protected. Further, the weather forecasting and warning systems established in\nDenmark have proven to be efficient to prevent human and economic losses from\nextreme events. Also, extreme storm surges in Copenhagen are limited and cannot\nexceed 2 m according to our statistical analysis, making it very easy to protect the city\nwith sea walls and dikes.\n2.3 The effects of climate change on sea levels around Copenhagen\nObserved sea level change Global mean sea levels rose by around 17 cm over the\ntwentieth-century, driven largely by the thermal expansion and melting glaciers,\nice caps and ice sheets associated with anthropogenic global warming. On top\nof this global trend, there are significant regional differences in sea level change\ndue to changes in ocean circulation and atmospheric pressure. Because of natural\nvariability, it is more difficult to detect a climate-change signal in the local sea level\nin Copenhagen than in global sea level. Over the last century, a linear trend of\n0.44 mm per year (i.e. 4 cm per century) can be observed in Copenhagen water level\ndata from the city Coastal Authority. The difference between this observed local\ntrend and the global rise in sea level is due to local factors (changes in ocean and\natmospheric circulation and local uplift3) and possibly to measurement and trend-\nextraction errors. The respective influence of these factors is still unclear.\nExpected global sea level rise Global sea levels are projected to continue to rise as\nthe world warms, increasing mean sea level rise at a local level. The 2007 Fourth\nAssessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)\nprojected that global mean sea levels would rise by 18\u201359 cm above 1990 levels by\nthe 2090s (where the lower bound corresponds to the lower estimate for the lowest\nemissions scenario, and the higher bound corresponds to the upper estimate for the\nhighest scenario). These projections, however, do not fully include contributions\nfrom the melting ice sheets (due to the limitations of the modelling techniques\nused). Other analyses (e.g., Rahmstorf 2007; Pfeffer et al. 2008) suggest global\nsea level rise between 50 and 200 cm above 1990 levels by 2100. Considering this\nuncertainty, our analysis is not based on a single sea level rise scenario, but on several\npossible amplitudes of sea level rise, from 0 to 125 cm. Results are presented in all\nthese possible cases and the consequences of this uncertainty are discussed in the\nconclusion.\nExpected regional sea level rise In terms of regional changes, the IPCC found that\nsea level rise could be greater than the global average around northern Europe.\nTheir Fourth Assessment Report projects a 18\u201359 cm rise in global mean sea level\nby the 2090s, but sea levels could rise by an additional 15\u201320 cm in the region due to\nchanging climate patterns (air and water currents), reaching up to 38\u201379 cm around\n3Geological uplift is the vertical elevation of the Earth\u2019s surface in response to natural causes\n(including the removal of Pleistocene ice sheets). The National Space Institute of the Technical\nUniversity of Denmark estimates that the land uplift in Copenhagen is about 1.2 mm per year\n(information kindly provided by Per Knudsen).\n118 Climatic Change (2011) 104:113\u2013137\nDenmark. However, these estimates are considered highly uncertain and will not\nbe used in this study. Moreover, any local vertical land movements would need to\nbe considered to estimate the overall mean sea level change. As Copenhagen is\nexperiencing uplift, this will offset a portion of the increase in sea levels due to\nanthropogenic warming. In this analysis, however, these estimates will not be used\nand we will assume that sea level in Copenhagen will rise at the global level.\n2.4 Expected change in storm surges\nClimate change can affect water levels around Copenhagen in two ways; firstly,\nby simply raising the mean sea level and also by changing the variability in sea\nlevels through, for example, changes in storminess, in particular, changes in the\ncharacteristics of extra-tropical cyclones. For example, an increase in the frequency\nof extra-tropical cyclones would reduce the return period of present-day storm surge\nevents; whereas an increase in the intensity of events could increase the return period\nof weak events and reduce the return period of intense events. Both could potentially\nincrease the risks associated with storm surges. It is not yet clear how climate change\nwill influence the characteristics of extra-tropical cyclones. While evidence suggests\nthat extra-tropical cyclones could become less frequent in both hemispheres, there\ncould be a larger number of the most intense storms (e.g., Lambert and Fyfe 2006;\nYin 2005; Lambert 2004; Leckebusch and Ulbrich 2004; Lozano 2004; Fyfe 2003;\nGeng and Sugi 2003; Lambert 1995). The most robust result is that there will be a\npoleward shift in the position of the storm tracks (e.g. Bengtsson et al. 2006; Salath\u00e9\n2006; Fischer-Bruns et al. 2005; Yin 2005; Fyfe 2003; Geng and Sugi 2003; Kushner\net al. 2001). In Europe, studies project an increase in storm track density (the\nnumber of storms) over Northwestern Europe, in particular, the UK and Scandinavia\n(Bengtsson et al. 2006; Lozano et al. 2004; Fischer-Bruns et al. 2005). There is also\nevidence that the intensity of storms will increase over Europe.4 Long-term records\nof sea levels around Europe also show signs of an increasing trend in the frequency\nof extreme sea levels (i.e. a reduced return-period for intense events) (Woodworth\nand Blackman 2002; Bouligand and Pirazzoli 1999). A number of modelling studies\nsuggest that, in the future, increases in extreme wave height are likely to occur in\nthe mid-latitude oceans (e.g. Wang et al. 2004; Caires et al. 2006). Woth et al. (2006)\nfound that, for the North Sea, a 100-year event could become 10\u201320 cm higher than\ntoday by the 2080s. Lowe and Gregory (2005) find a 50-year return-period storm\nsurge event becomes approximately 40\u201360 cm higher than today around the eastern\ncoast of Denmark by the end of this century (for a medium-high emissions scenario).\nIn the Baltic Sea, Meier (2006) found that water levels associated with a 100-year\nevent increase more rapidly than increases in mean sea levels. Our conclusion is that\nwhile there is evidence of changes in storminess with climate change, quantification\nof these changes for Copenhagen is not possible at present. In this study, we assume\nthat storm surge risk is changed only through sea level rise and not through changes\nin storminess. We note that this could lead to an underestimation of future risk and\n4Bengtsson et al. (2006) note an increase in the frequency of the most intense storms in Europe\n(despite seeing no significant increase globally), whilst Lozano et al. (2004) finds an eastward shift in\nthe most intense storms over the British Isles (as well as a general increase in intensity).\nClimatic Change (2011) 104:113\u2013137 119\na full study for Copenhagen should consider a broader range of scenarios for future\nstorminess.\n3 Insured exposure analysis\nThe exposure is the measure of the population and the assets that would be affected\nby a flood in absence of f lood protection. The exposure to coastal flooding in\nCopenhagen was calculated based on the area of land that would be inundated\nwith different sea levels and on the population and asset distribution. Because of\nconstraints on data availability, only insured assets are considered in this section;\nhowever, as all residential homes, personal property, businesses, and commercial\nproperty are insured publicly against flood (1991 Flood Act) we assume that the\ninsured residential, commercial and industrial exposure is roughly equal to the total\nexposure for these sectors. Our exposure estimates do not however include public\nassets, such as transport, energy and water infrastructures and government buildings.\nThese assets will be included in loss estimates in Section 4.\nPopulation data for Copenhagen was obtained from Landscan 2002 (constrained\nwithin metropolitan extent limits) and verified against UN 2005 population data\n(UN 2005). The metropolitan area was defined using postcode information (from\nRMS5 data). Data on residential, commercial and industrial exposure was based\non the industry exposure data from the RMS European Winterstorm Model. The\nexposure of population and asset value to coastal inundation was modelled through\ngeographical mapping onto a Digital Terrain Model (DTM). The DTM was gener-\nated from the 90 m (horizontal resolution) elevation database of the Shuttle Radar\nTopography Mission (SRTM). Exposures by elevation were then extracted from\nthe DTM at 1 m vertical intervals. Finally, cumulative exposures were calculated\nfor each of the sea level events, through interpolating linearly between the vertical\nintervals. At the pixel level, the SRTM elevation data can have errors of up to 10 m,\nwhich is large compared with sea level changes we are considering. These errors,\nhowever, are much lower in flat areas, where flood risks are concentrated, and have\na large long-wavelength component (at the continent scale) that is constant over\nour analysis area and is therefore not a problem when investigating local elevation\ndifferences (see a complete analysis in Rodriguez et al. 2005). In the present analysis,\nmoreover, elevation maps were created by analysing continuous contours iso-lines\nin the dataset, thereby smoothing out much of the short-wavelength errors. This\nmeans that this dataset is adequate for aggregate economic cost\u2013benefit analysis at\na city-level, as shown here, to assess the need for protection and other adaptation\nmeasures. However, given the errors inherent in individual pixels, this dataset is not\nadequate for localised engineering decisions, e.g. the design of sea walls and dykes.\nSuch analyses would require higher-resolution exposition and elevation datasets.\nThe exposure analysis shows that around 2% of the population (21,907 people)\nlive below an elevation of 1 m, 4% (44,446 people) below an elevation of 2 m\nand 13% (151,859 people) below an elevation of 5 m above sea level.

In terms of Total\nInsured Value (TIV), the industrial sector is most exposed and is vulnerable to even\nlimited increases in sea levels due to its location by the coast; around 24% (EUR\n1.7bn) of the industrial TIV across Copenhagen lies below an elevation of 1 m,\nand 18% (EUR 1.3bn) lies below 0.5 m. Most of this lies along the facing coasts of\nZealand and Amager, and on the southern coast. A sea level 4 m above the current\nnormal level would expose half of the industrial TIV. However, the industrial asset\nclass is relatively small in insured value terms compared with the Residential and\nCommercial classes. The Residential asset class becomes the largest contributor to\nexposed TIV for sea levels of more than 1 m above current mean level. Agricultural\ntotal insured value is also relatively low, unsurprising for an urban area.\nTable 1 summarizes the insured asset exposure (or TIV) at different levels of\nelevation relative to current mean sea level. The table distinguishes between the\nstructure exposure (i.e. the buildings themselves) and the content exposure (i.e. what\nis in the buildings). These values are calculated using the current economic situation\nin Denmark. Of course, socio-economic and population changes will influence\nexposure in the future. According to the 2005 UN population growth scenario,\nthe Danish population should increase by 2% by 2070. Assuming that the Danish\nurbanisation rate will increase from 86% today to 90% in 2070 and that all Danish\ncities will grow at the same rate, the Copenhagen population would increase by 7%\nby the 2070\u2019s. This population increase is small and it is unlikely that the global\nrisk profile of the city would change substantially due to population growth. Over\nthe long term, however, risk-oriented land-use policies can influence risk levels: the\nreplacement of old building or industrial property can be prohibited or discouraged\nin at-risk areas, and new developments can be favoured in less-exposed locations.\nIn this analysis, however, it is assumed that no such policy is implemented, and\nthat urbanized areas will basically remain unchanged in the future. However, it is\nexpected that existing properties in these unchanged urbanized areas will be replaced\nthrough normal processes, increasing in value in response to economic growth.\nBased on the OECD economic scenario for economic growth in Denmark, indeed,\nall exposed values could be multiplied by 3.5 due to GDP growth.

To take into account these\nuncertainties, it is common to carry out sensitivity analyses, using many scenarios to\ninvestigate how results are sensitive to socio-economic drivers and hypotheses. While\nincreased economic growth increases exposure, it also increases resilience in the\naffected economy, making it more capable to deal with disasters and reconstruction.\nThe most relevant figures to assess disaster seriousness, therefore, are the exposed\npopulation\u2014in absolute numbers\u2014and the ratio of exposed asset value to total\nasset value. These figures are likely to increase only marginally in the future in\nCopenhagen, as it is unlikely that the population of Denmark will increase rapidly in\nthe future, and given that the urbanization process is almost complete in this country.\nAs a consequence, no large change in socio-economic drivers is expected to modify\nour findings. For this reason, the rest of this report will disregard the role of socio-\neconomic trends on flood risks, to focus on the effect of climate change on the city as\nit is today, with current population and assets.\n4 Flood losses analysis in Copenhagen\nThere is a complex link between exposure to high sea level and the destruction and\nlosses caused by such episodes. First, a building that is affected by a flood is not\ncompletely destroyed. Thus, direct losses caused by an event are usually significantly\nlower than the exposure to this event. Second, high sea levels are frequent events, and\ncities are protected against the most frequent of them. In Sections 4.1 and 4.2, we will\nfirst assume that the city is not protected and assess potential losses. This analysis\nprovides the information required to design an optimal protection strategy. The\nactual protection of the city today, and the actual current flood risks in Copenhagen,\nare considered in Section 4.3. Moreover, as outlined in Section 3, considering the\nlimited urban changes that are expected in the future in Copenhagen, this analysis is\nbased upon Copenhagen as we find it today (i.e. an unchanged city over time).\n4.1 Assessing direct losses in absence of protection\nDirect losses here are defined as the repair and replacement cost of damaged\nbuildings and equipment. Of course, this cost is only a fraction of total cost, and\nadditional components of total cost (e.g., production loss, job loss) are investigated\nlater in the study. We estimate direct losses for each asset class at a given level of sea\nlevel through combining the exposure information given in Table 1 with pre-defined\nvulnerability curves. Vulnerability curves give the level of damage as a function\nof flood depth, where the level of damage is defined as the ratio of damages to\nthe total exposure6. Note that these estimates do not take into account important\n6Illustrative vulnerability curves have been provided by Risk Management Solutions. It should be\nnoted that early warning, disregarded here, can help reduce content losses. For instance, valuable\nequipment and furniture can often be saved by households if the event is forecasted early enough.\nThe vulnerability data used here, however, take into account the average effect of early warning and\nmitigation measures. In the future, improvements in the ability to forecast storms and storm surges\nmay reduce content losses significantly.\nClimatic Change (2011) 104:113\u2013137 123\nFig. 4 Direct losses as a\nfunction of sea level with\nrespect to current mean level,\nin absence of protection\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4\n0\n5\n10\n15\nWater level above current mean level (m)\nD\nire\nct\n lo\nss\nes\n (b\nillio\nn \n \n \n)\nlocal parameters of flooding: local differences in water level, water velocity, flooding\nduration, various building types in different areas, etc. Taking into account these\nfactors would require explicitly modelling the water flows at high-resolution; such\ndetailed analyses would be required for informing local engineering decisions.\nDirect losses to non-insurable assets, such as public infrastructure, must also be\nincluded but little information is available; to make an approximation, we draw\non the well documented consequences of the Katrina landfall in New Orleans.\nAccording to the Louisiana Recovery Authority,7 the Katrina losses were distributed\nin the following way: residential homes and personal property (USD 27\u201335 billion);\nbusinesses and commercial property (USD 25\u201329 billion); Infrastructure including\nroads, bridges, utilities (USD 15\u201318 billion); state facilities and public\/private ed-\nucation and health care facilities (USD 6\u20138 billion). As with Katrina losses, we\nwill assume, therefore, that uninsurable losses (infrastructure plus state facilities)\nrepresent about 40% of insurable losses (residential homes and personal property\nplus business and commercial). This estimate is also consistent with other studies in\nthe UK.8\nFigure 4 shows the direct loss estimates (insured + uninsured), as a function of\nthe water level in Copenhagen, and in absence of protection infrastructures. Using\nthis information coupled to the earlier storm surge return-period analysis (Fig. 2),\nand assuming that sea level rise only shifts water levels, it is possible to estimate the\nreturn-period of levels of direct losses for different magnitudes of sea level rise (in\nabsence of protection); shown in Fig. 5. Such statistical loss information forms the\nbasis of a risk-based cost\u2013benefit analysis for adaptation. Figure 5 shows that in the\ncurrent situation, a 1-in-100 year event would cause direct losses of about EUR 3\nbillion. With 50 cm sea level rise, a 1-in-100 year event would cause direct losses\namounting to about EUR 4.8 billion; i.e. a 55% increase on the present situation.\n7http:\/\/www.lra.louisiana.gov\n8See, e.g., Penning-Rowsell et al.

Several authors\nhave suggested that the direct costs, generally evaluated by insurance companies,\nmay be poor proxies of overall costs, particularly in the case of large-scale events\n(Tierney 1995; Pielke and Pielke 1997; Lindell and Prater 2003; Hallegatte et al. 2007;\nHallegatte 2008). Direct costs can be magnified by: (i) the spatial or sectoral diffusion\nof damages into the wider economic system over the short-term (e.g. through\ndisruptions of lifeline services) and over the longer term (e.g. sectoral inflation\ndue to demand surge, energy costs, company bankruptcy, larger public deficit, or\nhousing prices); (ii) the responses to an economic shock (e.g. loss of confidence,\nchange in expectations, indirect consequences of inequality deepening); (iii) financial\nconstraints impairing reconstruction (e.g. low-income families cannot finance rapidly\nthe reconstruction of their home); and (iv) technical constraints slowing down\nreconstruction (e.g. availability of skilled workers, difficulties in equipment and\nmaterial transportation, difficulties in accommodating workers).\nIn this section, we estimate the total costs of flooding in Copenhagen in terms of\nlost consumption. This cost is equal to the sum of direct and indirect costs. Indeed,\nthe direct costs is both (i) the reparation or replacement cost (at the pre-event price\nlevel) of the assets that have been damaged or destroyed; and (ii) the portion of the\nproduced value-added that has to be dedicated to reconstruction instead of normal\nconsumption. The indirect cost is the reduction in production of goods and services\nacross the economy due to the disaster. The sum of what is not produced and what\nis produced but cannot be consumed is equal to the lost consumption, i.e. the cost of\nthe disaster.\nIndirect costs include business interruption in the disaster aftermath, production\nlosses during the reconstruction period, and service losses in the housing sector. For\nClimatic Change (2011) 104:113\u2013137 125\nexample, if a EUR 1 million production facility is destroyed and immediately rebuilt,\nthe total loss is EUR 1 million; however, if reconstruction is delayed by 1 year, the\ntotal loss is the sum of the replacement cost (direct cost) and of the value of 1 year\nof lost production (indirect cost). For housing, the total cost of an extreme event\nthat destroys a house is equal to the replacement cost of the house plus the value\nattributed to lost housing services during the number of months or years it takes to\nrebuild it.9 The value of such production losses, in a broad sense, can be very high in\nsome sectors, especially when basic needs are at stake (housing, health, employment,\netc.). This distinction can also be represented in terms of stock (direct) and flow\n(indirect) losses.\nIndirect losses are difficult to estimate, but must be included to ensure a fair\ncost\u2013benefit analysis of protection for infrastructures or mitigation actions. Here,\nthe Adaptive Regional Input\u2013Output (ARIO, see Hallegatte 2008) model is used to\nassess these losses in the Copenhagen region. The model is based on input\u2013output\n(IO) tables and a hybrid modelling methodology, in the spirit of Brookshire et al.\n(1997). This dynamic model takes into account changes in production capacity due\nto productive capital losses and adaptive behaviour in disaster aftermaths. It should\nbe noted that the uncertainty in results is still large, and therefore, results should\nbe interpreted as indicative of the scale of potential damages. The model takes into\naccount (i) the propagation of effects among sectors of reduced production due to\ndisaster damages; (ii) the propagation of effects among sectors of reduced demands\ndue to disaster damages; (iii) the large demand in the construction sector due to\nreconstruction needs; (iv) the economic-agent behaviours to cope with disaster con-\nsequences and substitute non-available supplies (e.g., by increasing their production\nwhen demand is large, or by finding alternative suppliers when the original ones\ncannot produce); (v) the limitations in resource movement between sectors (e.g.,\nthe construction sector cannot grow instantaneously by hiring workers from other\nsectors; it is limited by the availability of qualified workers); (vi) the economic\ninteractions with regions outside the affected regions (through imports and exports).\nImportantly, the model is dynamic, with a 1-month time step, and reproduces the\nwhole reconstruction pathway, assuming that the economy will eventually return to\nits initial situation.10 Also, impacts outside the Copenhagen region are not assessed,\nbecause these impacts are distributed over a large number of economic actors, and\nare therefore small (often negligible) on a per capita basis.\nThe ARIO model is calibrated for the Copenhagen region (\u201cThe Capital Region\nof Denmark\u201d) using macroeconomic data from StatBank Denmark. The Danish\neconomy has eight main sectors: (1) agriculture, fishing and quarrying; (2) manufac-\nturing; (3) electricity, gas and water supply; (4) construction; (5) wholesale and retail\ntrade; hotels, restaurants; (6) transport, post and telecommunication; (7) finance and\nbusiness activities; (8) public and personal services. From the Danish Input\u2013Output\ntables, a regional IO table for the Copenhagen region is built using simple rules\n9There may also be gains to be accounted for, arising from the fact that, after reconstruction, assets\nare more recent than before the event. Considering infrastructure, production capital and housing,\nhowever, this gain is of second order.\n10For instance, businesses are assumed to lose clients and market shares over the short-term, but\nclients are assumed to return eventually to their original suppliers over the long-term, restoring\noriginal market shares.\n126 Climatic Change (2011) 104:113\u2013137\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000\n1200\nAg\nric\nu\nltu\nre\n, f\nis\nhi\nn\ng\na\nn\nd \nqu\nar\nry\nin\ng\nM\na\nn\nu\nfa\nct\nu\nrin\ng\nEl\ne\nct\nric\nity\n, g\nas\n \na\nn\nd\nw\na\nte\nr \nsu\npp\nly\nCo\nn\nst\nru\nct\nio\nn\nW\nho\nle\nsa\nle\n a\nn\nd\nre\nta\nil \ntra\nde\n; h\not\ne\nls\n,\nre\nst\na\nu\nra\nn\nts\nTr\na\nn\nsp\nor\nt, \npo\nst\n \na\nn\nd\nte\nle\nco\nm\nm\nu\nn\nic\na\ntio\nn\nFi\nn\na\nn\nce\n a\nn\nd\nbu\nsi\nn\ne\nss\n a\nct\niv\niti\ne\ns\nPu\nbl\nic\n \na\nn\nd\npe\nrs\no\nn\na\nl s\ne\nrv\nic\ne\ns\nH\no\nu\nsi\nn\ng\nD\nire\nct\n \nlo\nss\nes\n to\n \nca\npi\nta\nl (m\nill\nio\nn\n \neu\nro\ns)\nFig. 6 Estimated sector-per-sector losses due to a sea level 2 m above current sea level, in absence\nof protection\nbased on the size of each sector in this region (see Hallegatte 2008 for details).\nThe input to the model is the sectoral distribution of direct losses due to flooding.\nThese are calculated from the analyses of Section 4.2 with a number of assumptions:\n(i) residential losses affect only households; (ii) industrial losses are assumed to\naffect sectors 2, 3, 4, and 6 (per above) and are distributed among these sectors\nproportionally to the value added by each sector; (iii) commercial losses affect sectors\n5, 7 and 8, also proportionally to sector value added; and (iv) the uninsured additional\nlosses\u2014equal to 40% of insured losses\u2014are distributed between utilities (35%),\ntransportation (35%), and public and personal services (30%). Figure 6 provides an\nexample of the sectoral distribution of direct losses for a 2 m sea level above current\nlevel (corresponding to roughly to the 100-year event with a 50 cm sea level rise).\n4.2.1 Case study: 2 m sea level rise\nIn this subsection, we present the calculation and analysis of indirect losses for the\ncase of a 2 m increase in sea level above present-day levels; this would correspond,\nfor example, to a 50 cm increase in sea level and a 1-in-100 year storm surge event.\nFigure 7 shows the change in value added (VA) across 8 sectors as a function of time.\nFigure 8 shows the job losses in these sectors 3 and 12 months after the event. Clearly\nmost sectors show a reduction in VA, with the exception of the construction and, to\na lesser extent, manufacturing sectors. Reconstruction drives an increase in VA in\nthese two sectors.\nIn the early period following a storm surge, the losses and gains in VA are\nestimated to roughly balance each other, however a total of 7,500 jobs are lost in\nthe 3 months after the disaster. The sectors most heavily impacted in the aftermath\nof the event are: (1) wholesale and retail trade, hotels and restaurants, (2) finance\nand business activities, (3) transport, post and telecommunication, and (4) public and\npersonal services. Previous studies applying ARIO to the case of Katrina (Hallegatte\n2008) showed that employment losses in these sectors with many small businesses\nClimatic Change (2011) 104:113\u2013137 127\nFig. 7 Sector per sector\nchange in value added (in %)\nduring the reconstruction\nperiod, after a high sea level\nevent 2 m above current sea\nlevel, in absence of protection\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n-4\n-3\n-2\n-1\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nTime (years)\nCh\nan\nge\n in\n se\nct\nor\n va\nlu\ne \nad\nde\nd \n(%\n)\n \nAgriculture\nManufacturing\nUtilities\nConstruction\nTrade\nTransportation\nFinance\nPublic services\n(e.g. personal services) were underestimated, as the model is not able to account for\nbankruptcy and business closure. This suggests that public aid should be directed\ntoward these sectors in disaster aftermath.\nOver time the net VA loss for the region is actually negative; that is, there is an\nincrease in economic VA in the affected region. This is driven by the mobilization\nof unused resources and the transfer of reconstruction resources from outside the\nregion, and has a positive effect on the local economy as it creates jobs and income.\nOne year after the event, the reconstruction is underway and the construction and\nmanufacture sectors are a net creator of jobs, while lost jobs in other sectors are\nreduced by more than 50%. Nevertheless, the disaster still leads to 500 lost jobs\nat the aggregate level 1 year after the shock. Since there is a gain in VA, this\nanalysis suggests that the shock would not be detrimental at the macroeconomic\n-4000\n-3000\n-2000\n-1000\n0\n1000\n2000\nAg\nric\nu\nltu\nre\nM\na\nn\nu\nfa\nct\nu\nrin\ng\nEl\ne\nct\nric\nity\n,\ne\ntc\n.\nCo\nn\nst\nru\nct\nio\nn\nTr\nad\ne,\n \ne\ntc\n.\nTr\na\nn\nsp\nor\nt,\ne\ntc\n.\nFi\nn\na\nn\nce\n, \ne\ntc\n.\nPe\nrs\no\nn\na\nl\nse\nrv\nic\ne\ns\nCh\nan\nge\n in\n n\num\nbe\nr o\nf jo\nbs 3months\nafter\nthe\nevent\n12\nmonths\nafter\nthe\nevent\nFig. 8 Change in number of job per sector (positive is for additional jobs, negative is for job losses)\ndue to the 2 m event, 3 months and 12 months after the event, in absence of protection\n128 Climatic Change (2011) 104:113\u2013137\nscale, however it could still be very problematic at the sector level (e.g., for workers\nof the personal service sector).\nOver a 10-year period, the total VA gain for the event is EUR 95 million (it should\nbe noted however, that this additional production is used to repair and reconstruct\nwhat has been damaged by the flood, and should not be considered as additional\nconsumption). It is also noteworthy that the change in VA becomes negative for\nlarge disasters as indirect losses increase non-linearly with direct losses; for example,\nfor a 3 m event with EUR 8 billion in direct losses, total VA losses shift from being\nnet gains to net losses for the Danish economy as a whole.\nThe ARIO model is also able to estimate \u201cproduction loss\u201d in the housing sector;\nhouses and residential buildings provide a service that plays a major role in delivering\nlocal well-being. The decrease in housing services because of damaged houses and\nbuildings has, therefore, to be taken into account. For the 2 m water level case, the\nARIO model estimates housing service losses at EUR 260 million; greater than the\nestimated net gain due to VA increases in manufacturing and construction. The sum\nof all indirect impacts, therefore, is equal to EUR 165 million.\nTwo important caveats must be mentioned. Firstly, the model does not reproduce\nthe very first weeks following an event, during which lifeline services are disrupted\nand emergency operations impair the functioning of the economic system. The cor-\nresponding additional production losses are assumed to be one order of magnitude\nlower than the production losses estimated here. Secondly, the model assumes that all\nreconstruction costs are covered by commercial, household or automobile insurance,\nand households do not need to reduce consumption to pay for the reconstruction.\nThis assumption is likely to be fairly accurate for Denmark, but is unlikely to hold\nfor many other locations (see the case of Mumbai in Ranger et al. 2011, in this issue).\n4.2.2 Analysis of the link between direct losses and total losses\nIndirect economic losses are found to be significant in this analysis and are strongly\nnonlinear relative to direct losses. This nonlinearity arises from two factors: firstly, a\nlarger disaster causes larger production losses at a given point in time; and secondly,\nFig. 9 Change in total value\nadded (excluding housing\nservices) as a function of time,\nfor the 2 m and 4 m events in\nCopenhagen, in absence of\nprotection\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n-2\n-1.5\n-1\n-0.5\n0\n0.5\nTime (years)\nCh\nan\nge\n in\n a\nnn\nua\nl V\nA \n(%\n)\n \n \n2m event\n4m event\nClimatic Change (2011) 104:113\u2013137 129\nTable 2 Components of the total flood losses, as a function of water level above current mean level,\nin absence of protection\nEvent sea Direct Indirect losses Total losses Lost jobs\nlevel wrt losses Value added losses (million EUR) (direct + indirect) after\ncurrent (million EUR) Loss in Loss in Total value (million EUR) 3 months\nmean productive housing added (thousands)\nlevel (m) sectors services losses\n1 1,668 \u221258 72 14 1,682 3\n2 4,837 \u221295 257 162 4,999 7\n3 9,341 64 682 747 10,088 14\n4 14,478 517 1,446 1,964 16,442 21\na larger disaster leads to a longer reconstruction period and, therefore, production\nlosses last for a longer period. These two factors are illustrated in Fig. 9, which shows\nthe reconstruction dynamics in 2 m and 4 m water level cases. In the 4 m case, VA\nlosses 1 year after the shock exceed 1.5% of the pre-event level, while they are only\nabout 0.5% in the 2 m case. Moreover, total production is back to its initial level\n1 year after the shock in the 2 m case, while it takes 3 years in the 4 m case. Full\nreconstruction is almost completed 8 years after the event in the 4 m case, against\nonly 5 years in the 2 m case.\nDue to additional production in the construction and manufacturing sector, VA\nlosses in the production sectors remain limited or negative, ranging from EUR 95\nmillion for the 2 m event to EUR 517 million in the 4 m event. Most indirect losses\nstem from the housing sector, where delayed reconstruction\u2014due to production\ncapacity constraints in the construction sector\u2014has a large impact. Housing service\nlosses reach EUR 257 million for the 2 m event and EUR 1.4 billion for the 4 m event.\nThis type of loss is highly nonlinear, as illustrated by Table 2 and Fig. 10. This figure\nshows the indirect losses, including housing services, as a function of water level.

This is provided by Figs. 11 and 12, which shows\nthe total economic losses (direct losses plus production losses plus loss in housing\nservices) and the total job loss 3 months and 12 months after the event, respectively.\nFigure 11 shows that indirect losses remain small compared to direct losses for\nall the events considered here, suggesting that adaptation measures have to focus on\ndirect loss reduction (using dikes or reinforced buildings) rather than on indirect loss\nreduction (using insurance or support to small businesses).\nFig. 12 Total losses caused by\nthe flooding of Copenhagen,\nas a function of the rise in\nmean sea level, and for various\nevent return times, in absence\nof protection\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\nSea level rise (cm)\nTo\nta\nl lo\nss\nes\n (b\nillio\nn  \n  )\n \n \n10-yr flood\n50-yr flood\n100-yr flood\n500-yr flood\nClimatic Change (2011) 104:113\u2013137 131\nAs shown in Table 2, job loss 3 months after the event can reach more than 20,000\njobs for the 4 m events. Most lost jobs, however, are recreated rapidly, as job loss\nare always lower than 7,000 1 year after the storm. It should be mentioned that,\nwhile the aggregated job totals recover, there are still job losses in some sectors, with\ntotals compensated by job creation in the construction sector. This shift could cause\nsocial problems requiring public action, including shortage of qualified workers in\nthe construction sector. Further, short- to long-term structural unemployment among\nresidents in non-construction professions could arise due to skill and qualification\nmismatches as employment in the other sectors recovers at a slower pace.\nFrom the return level of high water level calculated in Section 2.2, and assuming\nthat the water levels are only shifted by sea level rise, it is possible to calculate\ntotal losses as a function of return time. The results, assuming no protection, are\nreproduced in Fig. 12. For instance, for no sea level rise, the water level with a 50-year\nreturn time would cause total losses amounting to EUR 2.9 billion with no protection.\nWith a 50 cm sea level rise, these losses increase 60% to EUR 4.7 billion. For the 100-\nyear event, losses are estimated at EUR 3.1 billion in the absence of sea level rise,\nwhereas losses also increase 60%, to EUR 5.0 billion with a 50 cm sea level rise, and\n140% increase to EUR 7.4 billion with a 1 m SLR.\n4.3 Coastal protection in Copenhagen, residual risks, and future risks\nThe previous analysis provides estimates for exposure and loss potentials, informa-\ntion which is needed to design optimal flood protection through cost\u2013benefit analysis\nor risk management strategies. A typical measure of the risk level is the mean annual\nloss, which is calculated as the sum of the occurrence probability of all possible events\nmultiplied by the total losses they would cause.\nFigure 13 shows an assessment of mean annual losses (direct + indirect) as a\nfunction of the protection level, which is assumed uniform in the city, and for several\nlevels of SLR. Our statistical analysis of storm surge considered only surges of more\nthan 80 cm, so protection below this level cannot be assessed. We also assume that an\novertopped dike is totally inefficient to control coastal floods. This is oversimplified,\nFig. 13 Mean annual losses, in\nmillion of Euros per year, as a\nfunction of the protection\nlevel, assumed uniform in the\nCopenhagen. Note: when\nprotection is less than 80 cm\nhigher than sea level (the\nhorizontal lines in the figure),\nour methodology is not\napplicable\n100 150 200 250 300\n1\n100\n10,000\nProtection level (cm)\nM\nea\nn \nan\nnu\na\nl l\nos\nse\ns \n(di\nrec\nt+i\nnd\nire\nct)\n(m\nillio\nns\n of\n E\nuro\ns, \nlo\nga\nrit\nhm\nic\n s\nca\nle\n)\nNo SLR\n25 cm SLR\n50 cm SLR\n75 cm SLR\n100 cm SLR\n125 cm SLR\n132 Climatic Change (2011) 104:113\u2013137\nof course, as even an overtopped dike\u2014provided it does not fail completely\u2014\ncan limit the amount of water that enters the city, therefore reducing the flooded\narea.\nThe \u201cNo SLR\u201d line in this figure shows that Copenhagen is currently easy to\nprotect against storm surges. While annual mean losses can reach several billions\nof Euros with protection of less than 1 m, they decrease very rapidly with protection\nheight. They are lower than 100,000 Euros per year for 180 cm protection, and null\nfor protection higher than 202 cm. Interestingly, this rapid decrease in mean annual\nloss arises from the probability of occurrence, which decreases very rapidly as water\nlevel increases, not from the event losses, which are increasing almost linearly with\nwater level. In other terms, this decrease does not arise from the topography of\nCopenhagen, but from the characteristics of storm surges in its location, i.e. from\nthe fact that the city is protected from the strongest storms by its locality.\nCopenhagen has a coastline of about 60 km, and the building cost of 1 m-high dikes\nis estimated to be about USD 2.5 million per km (Hoozemans et al. 1993). Using\nthis as an assumption, it is possible to estimate the construction cost of coastal flood\nprotection to be a few hundred millions of Euros for the city, for height of less than\n2 or 3 m. In particular, in the range of dike heights that are necessary given the sea\nlevel rise projections considered here, construction costs are not expected to exhibit\nstrong nonlinearities. Considering the potential flood losses shown in Fig. 13, it seems\neconomically rational to protect the city with very high dikes. Taking into account\nthe uncertainty in the different steps of our analysis, and especially the uncertainty\nconcerning the highest possible storm surges assessed in Section 2.2, it is rational\u2014\neven in absence of sea level rise\u2014to protect the city with dikes that are higher than\n202 cm.\nFigure 13 also shows why it is necessary to have higher protection over time as\nsea level rises. With 202 cm coastal protection, the annual mean loss is zero in our\nanalysis with current sea level, but increases to EUR 1 million per year with 25 cm\nof SLR, EUR 52 million per year with 50 cm of SLR, and EUR 4.2 billion per year\nwith 100 cm of SLR. With 300 cm protection, mean annual losses are larger than zero\nonly if SLR is larger than 1 m. With 350 cm of protection, even 125 cm of SLR does\nnot lead to any losses.\nFig. 14 Illustrative example\nassuming a homogenous\nprotection at 180 cm above\ncurrent mean sea level (in the\n\u2018No SLR\u2019 and \u201850 cm SLR\u2019\ncases).

This is shown in Fig. 14, which is identical to Fig. 13, but\nassumes as an illustration that the city is homogenously protected by dikes at 180 cm\nabove current mean sea level. In this figure, the vertical arrow shows the cost of 50 cm\nof SLR, which is the increase in mean annual losses due to a 50 cm SLR in absence\nof adaptation (i.e. with no change in the 180 cm protection level). The horizontal\narrow shows the need for adaptation, i.e. by how much the protection level should\nbe increased to maintain unchanged the mean annual losses due to coastal floods.\nUsing dike cost estimates, this need for adaptation can be translated into adaptation\ncosts. This figure, therefore, shows both the cost of SLR in absence of adaptation, and\nthe cost of adaptation to cancel SLR impacts. These cases are two specific options,\nbut other possibilities exist: for instance, one can decide to upgrade protection so that\nannual mean losses are reduced compared with the current cases (i.e. to do more than\nadaptation). Regardless, this figure can be used to carry out cost\u2013benefit analysis of\ncoastal protection upgrades in a climate change context.\nOf course, the present uncertainty on sea level rise makes the use of these results\nmore difficult. Figure 14, however, also allows the assessment of the potential cost\nof ill-adaptation, be it due to sea level rise underestimation (i.e. a too low protection\nFig. 15 Population density under and above 2 m elevation, and coastal protection, indicated by\ncolored ellipsoids (green for 3.5 m protection; yellow for 2.0 m protection and red for 1.5 m protection)\n134 Climatic Change (2011) 104:113\u2013137\nlevel and too high mean annual losses from floods) or overestimation (sunk costs\ndue to overinvestment is too large dikes). In the current situation in Copenhagen,\nit is very likely that the cost of underestimation would be much larger than the\ncost of overestimation, because protection construction costs have a large fixed-\ncost component while mean annual losses for floods soar rapidly when protection is\ninsufficient. In a risk management strategy, therefore, it seems preferable to consider\na pessimistic scenario in adaptation design and land use planning.\nInformation about Copenhagen on existing protection suggests that the city is very\nwell protected against storm surges. This is consistent with the results of our analysis.\nFirst, in the Copenhagen city centre and in the harbour, quays are at more than 2 m\nabove current sea level. Considering that we estimate the maximum possible storm\nsurge in the current climate at 2 m (Section 2.2), this protection level suggests that\nthe historical centre\u2014where population density is very high\u2014is not at risk of coastal\nfloods today. In locations that are at-risk according to Fig. 3, protection is present\nin the form of dikes (see Fig. 15). Considering these protection levels, it seems that\nCopenhagen is very well protected from coastal flood risk, and even in many places\nover-protected (e.g., western part of Amager island). As a consequence, even a large\namount of sea level rise could be managed by the current protection system. Only a\nfew areas could be affected by storm surges with the current sea level (e.g., Hvidovre)\nand with higher sea levels (e.g., historical centre of Copenhagen and the harbour).\nIn these areas, protection will have to be upgraded to prevent coastal flood risk from\nincreasing rapidly across the ranges of sea level rise considered here. The concerned\ncoastline segments are relatively limited but include important locations (e.g., the\nharbour and the city historical centre).\n5 Conclusions\nOur analysis concludes that Copenhagen is not highly vulnerable to coastal flooding\ntoday due to its high standards of defence and is unlikely to become so in the\nfuture. In the absence of protection, potential losses would nevertheless increase\nsignificantly over time. For instance, the total losses (direct and indirect) caused\nby a present-day 100-year storm surge event, at 150 cm above normal sea level,\nare estimated to reach EUR 3 billion with no protection. In the aftermath of such\nan event, thousands of jobs would be lost and thousands would be created in the\nconstruction sector. Other types of impact have been disregarded here, but may\nalso be important (e.g., casualties, illness, psychological trauma, disruption of social\nnetworks, loss of national competitive strength and market positions, loss of cultural\nheritage, city attractiveness, etc.). Even with the relatively narrow set of economic\nimpacts considered here, the reconstruction process would last several years and\ncause a significant shock to the local and the national economy.\nIn the absence of protection, future sea level rise would significantly increase\nflood risks beyond this level. For instance, with 25 cm of mean sea level rise (SLR)\ntotal losses caused by a future 100-year event would rise from EUR 3 billion to\nEUR 4 billion, to EUR 5 billion with 50 cm of mean SLR, and to almost EUR\n8 billion with 100 cm of SLR. The timescale of these increases in losses cannot\nbe determined, because of uncertainty in future sea level rise. Indeed, in the most\noptimistic scenarios (low emission, low climate sensitivity, low response of sea level),\nClimatic Change (2011) 104:113\u2013137 135\nSLR should not exceed 25 cm by the end of this century. In the most pessimistic IPCC\nscenario, SLR would reach 25 cm in 2050 and up to 60 cm in 2100. In alternative\nscenarios (e.g., Rahmstorf 2007; Hansen 2007), SLR could exceed 1 m by 2100.\nAssessing the consequences of one event (i.e. the 100-year event) is not enough to\nassess aggregate risk across time. A typical measure of the risk level is the mean\nannual loss, which is calculated as the sum of the occurrence probability of all\npossible events multiplied by the total losses they would cause and is equal to the\nexpected value of annual flood losses. The mean annual loss takes into account all\npossible storm surges, and depends on the protection level. As extreme sea level\nevents (referred to as \u201cstorm surge events\u201d) are not particularly high in Copenhagen,\nthe city is relatively easy to protect with dykes and sea walls and the residual risk is\nlow: while annual mean losses can reach several billions of Euros with protection of\nless than 1 m, they decrease very rapidly with protection height. They are lower than\n100,000 Euros per year for 180 cm protection, and null for protection higher than\n2 m.\nThe construction cost of a coastal flood protection system for Copenhagen is\nestimated to be a few hundred million Euros, but additional costs have to be\ntaken into account. Additional market costs include the functioning of the harbour,\ndike maintenance, drainage and pumping infrastructures. Non-market costs include\naesthetic considerations and city attractiveness. For very large increases in sea level,\nthese costs may become significant and will need to be balanced against the benefits\nof \u201chard\u201d protection.\nConsidering the potential flood losses and the protection cost, it would be a ratio-\nnal decision to protect the city with very high dikes. Information about Copenhagen\u2019s\ncurrent protection infrastructure against high sea levels suggests that the city is\nactually very well protected against possible storm surges. In some locations, current\nprotection appears to be much higher than the largest possible event (e.g., Amager\nIsland), and can thus protect the city against storm surges, even with significant sea\nlevel rise in the future. In other locations, defence upgrades will be necessary with\nsea level rise to maintain flood risk near zero. The concerned coastline segments\nare relatively limited but include important locations (e.g., the harbour and the city\nhistorical centre). It will be necessary to anticipate the need for these investments\nto implement them in due time. Uncertainty about future sea level rise makes it\nimpossible to predict today when exactly these improvements will be needed, but\nrisk is already increasing in the least well defended locations (e.g., Hvidovre).\nBecause flood exposure will increase regardless of the protection level, the conse-\nquence of protection failure will increase with sea level rise. Faultless maintenance\nwill, therefore, become even more crucial than today. Also, since failure is always\npossible, it will be necessary to improve emergency plans, early warning and evacua-\ntion schemes, and disaster preparedness and organization. Because protection failure\nis always possible and because dike maintenance is costly and involves significant\nnon-market costs, physical protection and preparedness should be complemented\nwith land-use and urbanization plans that make sure additional people and assets are\nnot put at unacceptable level of risk.\nFinally, past experience demonstrates that the retrofit of coastal defence struc-\ntures is a lengthy process requiring forward thinking and planning. Land-use and\nurbanization plans take even longer to have a significant impact on risk levels.\nIt is thus necessary to start thinking about long-term adaptation in coastal cities\n136 Climatic Change (2011) 104:113\u2013137\ntoday, even if the risks of climate change are not imminent. All planning and new\ninfrastructure investments must take account of the risk over the entire lifetime of\nthe investment to reduce unnecessary capital replacement costs. Because of climate\nchange and sea level rise uncertainty, anticipating requires to build defences in a way\nthat allows for flexibility, taking into account the uncertainties in projections and\nmaking it possible to upgrade them if sea level rise is larger than expected.\nThe analysis carried out here has several caveats which are important to highlight\nwhen considering these results. The assessment of economic impacts associated\nwith sea level rise and coastal flooding has been simplified in several ways. In\nparticular, the analysis treats built infrastructure vulnerability very roughly. Flood\nduration and water velocity are also not taken into account in loss assessment, and\nflood defences are not explicitly modelled and the consequences of overtopping are\nnot represented in any detail. There is large uncertainty in particular concerning\ndamages to infrastructure and other uninsured properties, while the modelling of\nindirect losses is incomplete and disregards important dimensions of social well-\nbeing. Finally, this analysis focuses on this century alone, however we know that\nadaptation options, such as dikes, are efficient only up to a certain point that\nwill inevitably be exceeded in the distant future in absence of emission reductions\nallowing for climate stabilisation. The long-term consequences of climate change\nare an important argument in favour of mitigation policies and these should not be\ndisregarded.\nAcknowledgements The authors want to thank Ian Cochran and Fanny Henriet for their research\nassistance.
