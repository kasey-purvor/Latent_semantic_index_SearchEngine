INTRODUCTION\nGamma-ray spectroscopy of the excited states within cad-\nmium and palladium isotopes have yielded interesting features\nassociated with the competition between vibrational and\nrotational collective excitation in nuclei [1\u20135] (and references\ntherein). At higher spins within 106\u2212110Cd, collective structures\nbuilt upon two quasiparticle excited states, such as maximally\naligned, decoupled (\u03bdh 11\n2\n)2 bands built upon a I\u03c0 = 10+\nbandhead and other four and six quasiparticle structures in\n106Cd [6], 108Cd [7,8], 110Cd [9\u201311], and 112,114Cd [12] are\nevident. References [13\u201315] suggest that from deduced intra-\nband B(E2) values, the collective excited states above the yrast\nI\u03c0 = 16+ state in 106,108Cd are generated by \u201cantimagnetic\nrotation\u201d. Sequences built on the \u03bdh 11\n2\norbital are a readily\napparent feature in the odd-A cadmium [11,16] and palladium\nisotopes [17\u201320]. Initial comparative studies of the energetics\nof these bands in cadmium [16,21] and palladium isotopes\n*s.ashley@surrey.ac.uk\n[20,22] suggested that there is a rotation-aligned coupling\n(RAC) [23] of the unpaired neutron to the core states.\nThis paper reports on an experiment using a Recoil Distance\nDoppler Shift technique [24] to determine B(E2) values\nof medium spin near-yrast states in 103Pd and 106,107Cd.\nPreliminary analyses of some of the results from this work have\nbeen presented in conference proceedings [25\u201327]. The values\nquoted in the present work vary with the values presented\nin [25,26] due to differences in the normalisation used and the\nuncertainty associated with the spread in recoil velocity (see\nSec. II B).\nII. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\nA. Overview\nTwo experiments were undertaken at the Wright Nu-\nclear Structure Laboratory, Yale University in August\n2004. Both experiments used the 98Mo(12C, xn)110-xCd and\n98Mo(12C, \u03b1xn)106-xPd fusion-evaporation reactions to popu-\nlate medium-spin excited states in the nuclei of interest, with\nthe 12C beam, provided from the Yale ESTU Tandem Van de\n0556-2813\/2007\/76(6)\/064302(8) 064302-1 \u00a92007 The American Physical Society\nS.

Total projection of \u03b3 -\u03b3 coincidence matrix for the\n98Mo +12 C reaction at 60 MeV using the backed target.\nGraaff accelerator [28]. The beam had an average on-target\ncurrent of 2 \u2192 3 pnA and incident energy of 60 MeV in the\nlaboratory frame. The reaction \u03b3 rays were detected using the\nSPEEDY \u03b3 -ray array [29] in a configuration with seven HPGe\nclover detectors, four of which were at angle of 41.5\u25e6, three\nof which were at an angle of 138.5\u25e6, relative to the beam-line\naxis. The data acquisition was set such that a valid event had\nto consist of two (or more) \u03b3 rays being detected within a 2 \u00b5s\ntime window.\nThe first experiment was a backed target experiment\nconsisting of a 0.5 mg\/cm2,98Mo target on a 9 mg\/cm2\n197Au backing and was primarily used for level scheme\ndetermination. From the total projection spectra shown in\nFig. 1, it is apparent that excited states in 103,104Pd and 106,107Cd\nwere populated in the current work. By investigating the\ncoincident \u03b3 rays, partial level schemes of 103Pd and 106,107Cd,\nshown in Figs. 2 and 3, were constructed to show the excited\nstates populated in this reaction. These level schemes are\nconsistent with the previously reported level schemes for these\nnuclei, as published in Refs. [6,21,30].\nThe second experiment was a Recoil Distance Doppler\nShift (RDDS) experiment [24] consisting of a 1.05 mg\/cm2,\nself-supporting 98Mo target with a separate 10 mg\/cm2 197Au\nstopper.

For the latter experiment, the New Yale Plunger Device\n(NYPD) [32] was utilized to set and maintain the distance\nbetween the target and stopper. In total, ten distances, ranging\nfrom 11 \u00b5m to 2 mm were set, with the total number of\n\u03b3 \u03b3 coincidences recorded at each distance given in Table I.\nThe average \u03b3 \u03b3 master rate for both experiments was 4 \u2192\n5 kHz. For each distance, the acquired data were sorted offline\ninto three, two-dimensional E\u03b3 - E\u03b3 matrices, for forward\n(\u03b8 = 41.5\u25e6) vs backward (\u03b8 = 138.5\u25e6), forward vs forward,\nand backward vs backward detectors, respectively, with a\n\u2018prompt\u2019 time condition set such that two \u03b3 -rays had to be\ndetected within \u223c50 ns. The coincidence matrices were then\nsubsequently analysed using the TV analysis software [33] as\nused in Refs. [34,35].\nTABLE I.

The dashed line\ndenotes the measured centroid of the Doppler-shifted peak.\nB. DDCM analysis and results\nThe differential decay curve method (DDCM) [36,37] is an\nanalysis technique used for data obtained from Recoil Distance\nDoppler Shift experiments, such that mean-lifetimes of excited\nstates in nuclei can be determined precisely. In the analysis\nof the current work, a \u03b3 -ray energy coincidence gate was\nplaced on the Doppler-shifted component (for each distance)\nof the transition directly feeding the excited state of interest.\nThereafter, the intensities of the stopped and Doppler-shifted\n\u03b3 rays for a transition depopulating this excited state were\ndetermined by fitting two Gaussian curves to these peaks. Each\nset of intensities for stopped and Doppler-shifted peaks was\nnormalised such that the sum of these intensities are constant.\nThis was performed by dividing each set of intensities by the\nnumber of counts in each projection spectrum. The mean-\nlifetime of this excited state could then be extracted directly\nusing Eq. (1) (see [36] for a full derivation), where IU and IS are\nthe respective intensities of stopped and shifted transitions, v\nis the recoil velocity, \u03c4 is the mean-lifetime of the excited state\nand x is the target-stopper distance. The NAPATAU program\n[38] was used to fit curves to the stopped and Doppler-shifted\nnormalized intensities and also to deduce the mean-lifetime:\n\u03c4 = IU\nv dIs\ndx\n. (1)\nFor standard DDCM analysis, the most significant errors\nassociated with the measured mean-lifetime arise from the\nstatistical uncertainties associated with the fitting of the decay\ncurves and the range in the recoil velocities in the nuclei of\ninterest. In the current work, there was a significant spread in\nrecoil velocities due to the relatively low initial recoil velocity\n( v\nc\n\u2248 1%) and the beam and recoils slowing down\/stopping\nwithin the target. The low v\nc\nof the recoiling compound\nnucleus resulted in a small energy separation between the\nstopped and Doppler-shifted peaks. In some cases, only partial\nselection of the shifted component could be used as the feeding\ncomponent and this in turn modifies the selection of recoil\nvelocities. Previous works have accounted for this spread in\nrecoil velocity by determining the velocity distribution of the\nrecoils by Monte Carlo techniques and subsequent Doppler\nShift Attenuation (DSA) measurements (see Ref. [39]). In the\ncurrent analysis, repeated measurements of the lifetimes were\nperformed by selecting \u201cnarrow\u201d energy\/velocity components\nof the feeding transition, along with a \u201cwide\u201d energy\/velocity\ngate which covers the sum of the individual narrow en-\nergy\/velocity components. This is demonstrated in Fig. 4,\nwhich shows the projections of the forward Doppler-shifted\ncomponents of the 515 keV, I\u03c0 = 152\n\u2212 \u2192 112\n\u2212\ntransition in\n107Cd. The upper four spectra are projections from four 1\nkeV wide backward-shifted gates, ranging from 791 keV to\n795 keV and the bottom spectrum is the sum gate spanning\nfrom 791 keV to 795 keV. It is evident from Fig. 4 that there\nis a continuous displacement in peak position and thus recoil\nvelocity from v\nc\n= 0.0080 \u2192 0.0096. A systematic error has\nbeen incorporated for the spread of recoil velocities, which\nis added in quadrature to the statistical error. This systematic\nerror is approximated to the range of recoil velocities for a\nsingle 1 keV wide gate in the total projection spectrum. The\nvalues of the statistical and systematic error are presented\nseparately in the results section. The resultant value for\nthe mean-lifetime comes from the weighted mean of the\nmean-lifetimes deduced from all \u201cnarrow\u201d and \u201cwide\u201d gating\ncombinations. Further details of the gating conditions used for\neach lifetime measurement, plus all spectra and decay curves,\ncan be found in Ref. [40].\nC. Lifetime determination of excited states in 106Cd\n1. Lifetime determination of the I\u03c0 = 12+ state at Ex = 5418 keV\nThe mean-lifetime of the 5418 keV, I\u03c0 = 12+ state, was\ndetermined by gating on the Doppler-shifted component of\nthe 808 keV, I\u03c0 = 14+ \u2192 12+ transition and projecting the\nstopped and shifted components of the I\u03c0 = 12+ \u2192 10+\ntransition.

DISCUSSION\nThe mean-lifetimes, \u03c4 can be converted into B(E2) values\nusing the formula in Eq. (2) [41]\nB(E2) = 1\n1.225 \u00d7 109E5\u03b3 \u03c4 (1 + \u03b1)\n, (2)\nwhere E\u03b3 is the \u03b3 -ray energy (in MeV) of the E2 transition\ndepopulating the decaying state, \u03b1 is the total internal conver-\nsion coefficient, the mean-lifetime, \u03c4 , is in ps, and the B(E2)\nvalues are in units of e2fm4. Cranked shell model calculations,\nreported in [6], suggest that the collective excitations built upon\nthe (\u03bdh 11\n2\n)2, I \u03c0 = 10+ state at Ex = 4812 keV in 106Cd are\nrotational and that the nucleus is weakly deformed. Similarly,\nthe \u03bdh 11\n2\nconfiguration associated with the I\u03c0 = 112\n\u2212\nstates\nin 103Pd and 107Cd is also assumed to be weakly deformed\n[21,22]. Therefore, the B(E2) values can then be directly\nsubstituted into Eq. (3), assumed for an axially symmetric\ndeformed nucleus [42], which yields a deformation in \u03b22:\nB(E2) = 5\n16\u03c0\ne2Q2t |\u3008JiK20|Jf K\u3009|2, (3)\nQt \u2248 3\u221a5\u03c0 ZR\n2\n0\u03b22(1 + 0.16\u03b22), (4)\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n0\n40\n80\n120\nN\num\nbe\nr \nof\n C\noi\nnc\nid\nen\nce\ns \n(0\n.5\nke\nV\n p\ner\n c\nha\nnn\nel\n)\n0\n40\n80\n120\n470 480 490\nE\u03b3 (keV)\n0\n40\n80\n120\n470 480 490\nE\u03b3 (keV)\n11\u00b5m\n18\u00b5m\n28\u00b5m\n56\u00b5m\n330\u00b5m 2008\u00b5m\n127\u00b5m\n41\u00b5m\n23\u00b5m\n14\u00b5mu s\nu\nu\nu\nu\ns\nu\nu\nu\nu\nu\ns\ns\ns s\ns\ns\ns\ns\nFIG. 8.

TRS calculations [see (b) of Fig. 10], for the I\u03c0 = 12+\nstate assuming a (\u03bdh11\/2)2 character, yield an associated \u03b22\ndeformation of 0.17.\nB. I\u03c0 = 152\n\u2212\nstates in 103Pd and 107Cd\nThe deduced \u03b22 deformation of 0.16(1) for the I\u03c0 = 152\n\u2212\nstate in 103Pd is consistent with the predicted value of 0.16\nfrom the TRS calculation. The mean-lifetime of the I\u03c0 = 152\n\u2212\nstate in 107Cd obtained in the current work [31.4(17) ps]\nis significantly larger than the previously measured value\nfor this state by Ha\u00a8usser et al. [44] of 23.5(15) ps. We\nnote that the value reported by Ha\u00a8usser et al. did not use\nthe coincidence-based DDCM to analyze the data and thus\nunobserved feeding effects could attribute for the measured\ndifference. The deduced \u03b22 deformation of 0.12(1) for this\nstate in 107Cd, compares with the TRS prediction of 0.18.\nWe note, however, that the deformation predicted for the\nground state of 107Cd by Mo\u00a8ller-Nix (\u03b22 = 0.135) [45] is\ncloser to the experimentally deduced \u03b22 value.

The corresponding higher \u03b22\nvalue of 0.18 in 109Cd [46] suggests a larger deformation for\nthe configuration in that nucleus compared to 107Cd.\nIV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\nIn summary, an experiment has been performed using the\nYale ESTU tandem Van de Graaff accelerator, SPEEDY \u03b3 -ray\narray, and New Yale Plunger Device to populate medium spin\nstates in 103Pd and 106,107Cd. Utilizing the differential decay\ncurve method, the mean-lifetimes of various excited states have\nbeen deduced and are presented in Table II. The inferred axially\nsymmetric \u03b22 deformation of 0.14(1) for the I\u03c0 = 12+ state\nin 106Cd at Ex = 5418 keV, compare to a prediction by TRS\ncalculation, assuming a predominantly \u03bd(h 11\n2\n)2 configuration\nof \u03b22 = 0.17. A similar value for the \u03b22 deformation of the\nI\u03c0 = 11\u2212 state in 106Cd at Ex = 4324 keV has also been\ndeduced. The mean-lifetimes of the yrast I\u03c0 = 152\n\u2212\nstates\nin 103Pd and 107Cd have also been deduced. For 107Cd, the\nmean-lifetime for the yrast I\u03c0 = 152\n\u2212\nstate at Ex = 1360 keV\nis significantly larger than that reported previously in [44].\nThe corresponding \u03b22 value of 0.12(1) compares with the\nassociated \u03b22 value of 0.14(1) from Ha\u00a8usser et al. and a\ntheoretical prediction (from a TRS calculation) of 0.18. In\n103Pd, the inferred \u03b22 deformation of 0.16(1) compares well\nwith the value predicted by TRS calculation of 0.16.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nA. Dewald, O. Mo\u00a8ller, and P.
