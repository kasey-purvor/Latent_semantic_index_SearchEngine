Res., 113, C02016, doi:10.1029\/2007JC004371.\n1. Introduction\n[2] It is thought that the action of the wind stress on the\nsurface geostrophic ocean flow provides power to the ocean\nat a rate of about 1 TW (1012 W). Wunsch [1998] used\ncurrents calculated using satellite altimetry and the EGM96\ngeoid [Lemoine et al., 1997], together with wind stress\nestimated from winds (not accounting for ocean currents)\nfrom the National Centers for Environmental Prediction\n(NCEP), to estimate a rate of work of 0.88 TW, of\nwhich about 0.84 TW comes from the product of time-\naveraged wind stress and time-averaged current. The\nsame total resulted from a model-based analysis, although\nwith a slightly larger fractional contribution from the\ntime-dependent term. Error estimates are difficult, but\nScott [1999] estimated an error of 37% for the Pacific\nbasin, on the assumption that geoid errors dominate. Von\nStorch et al. [2007] (VS hereafter) have since analyzed in\nsome detail the power input into a 0.1! ocean model,\nconcluding that a total of 1.1 TW is made available to the\ndeep ocean beneath the surface boundary layer, and that\nWunsch\u2019s methodology works well, leading to an estimate\nfor this model of 1.06 TW, composed of 0.92 TW from the\nproducts of time-averaged stress and current velocity, and\n0.14 TW from the time-dependent component.\n[3] All of these calculations rely on the rather smooth\nwind stress patterns which result from numerical weather\nprediction models. Examination of wind stress measured by\nthe NSCAT scatterometer, however, showed small scale\nstructure, particularly in wind stress curl and divergence\n[Milliff and Morzel, 2001], and comparison of QuikSCAT\nspectra with numerical weather prediction models shows\nthat these models strongly underestimate the power in wind\nstress at scales shorter than 500\u20131000 km [Milliff et al.,\n2004]. In the equatorial Pacific, where strong currents and\nrelatively weak winds occur, some of the structure in\nNSCAT data was seen to be due to the influence of ocean\ncurrents on wind stress [Kelly et al., 2001]. Although fine\nstructure elsewhere could not initially be clearly distin-\nguished from sampling error, subsequent examination of\nlonger time series from the QuikSCAT scatterometer\nshowed a clear influence of small-scale ocean processes\non the wind stress [Chelton et al., 2004]. Two forms of\noceanic influence are identified as being important in\nproducing such small-scale signals [Xie, 2004; Chelton et\nal., 2004]: The atmosphere-ocean temperature difference\ninfluences both the wind field and the wind stress via a quite\ncomplicated process involving the stability of, and turbulent\nmixing in, the marine atmospheric boundary layer. Chelton\net al. [2004] briefly summarize the effect of small-scale\ntemperature as a tendency to decrease the surface wind\nspeed over cool water and increase it over warm water. The\nsecond form of influence is the ocean surface currents.\nAlthough currents are generally much slower than winds,\nand their effect is often neglected in wind stress formula-\ntions (which should properly be formulated in terms of the\ndifference between wind and current velocities), currents\ntend to occur at shorter length scales than winds in most\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 113, C02016, doi:10.1029\/2007JC004371, 2008\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory, Liverpool, U.K.\nCopyright 2008 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/08\/2007JC004371$09.00\nC02016 1 of 10\nparts of the ocean, permitting this effect to stand out in\ndifferentiated measures such as wind stress curl.\n[4] These observations prompted Duhaut and Straub\n[2006] (DS hereafter) to consider the implications of a link\nbetween wind stress and ocean current for calculations of\nthe rate of wind work. Although a rather small change to the\nwind stress is usually implied by taking account of the\ncurrent, a surprisingly large effect on the wind work (about\n20%) is implied by this link. The reason is that the effect of\naccounting for currents is negative definite. When wind and\ncurrent are in the same direction, the stress is smaller than\nthat which would be calculated ignoring the current, and is\nin the same direction as the current, resulting in a smaller\npower input into the ocean. When they are in opposite\ndirections, the stress is greater, but is opposing the current,\nreducing in an increased energy flux out of the ocean. In\neither case, the energy flux into the ocean is reduced. The\nanalysis is more complicated when accounting for winds\nand currents in different directions but, on the assumption\nthat the current is much slower than the wind, DS derive an\nequation for the error due to ignoring the current effect,\nwhich shows it to be positive definite:\nP1 ! P \u00bc rAcdU v2 \u00fe v20\n! \"\n; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere P is the actual power per unit area at a particular\nplace, P1 is that calculated using stresses based on the wind\nvelocity alone, rA is atmospheric density, cd is the drag\ncoefficient (assumed constant for this derivation), U is the\nwind speed, v is the ocean current speed, and v0 is the\ncomponent of ocean current in the direction of the wind. A\nsimple scaling estimate based on this formula suggests that\ncorrectly accounting for currents in calculating wind stress\nwould result in a 20% reduction in power input to the ocean.\nThe formula (1) refers to the instantaneous power input, and\na time average involves the mean ocean surface kinetic\nenergy (we shall see later that v0\n2 can rather accurately be\nreplaced by v2\/2). As DS point out, the ocean surface kinetic\nenergy is dominated (at least in extratropical regions) by the\nmesoscale, and the mesoscale in turn is dominated by the\ntime dependent eddies and meanders, so the power\nreduction is expected to be strongest in regions of strong\nmesoscale eddy activity. From DS, an idealised numerical\nmodel experiment for a region of strong eddy activity\nsuggests a 35% reduction (note that these percentages are all\nexpressed relative to the larger, false estimate of power\nrather than the smaller, true value. A 35% reduction from\nfalse to true value is equivalent to a 54% increase of the true\nvalue to give the false value). We will call this systematic\neffect of currents on power the \u2018\u2018DS effect\u2019\u2019.\n[5] Model simulations have confirmed the size of this\neffect in more realistic geometries, for the North Pacific,\nwhere a correct wind stress formulation reduces the power\ninput by 27% [Dawe and Thompson, 2006], and for an\neddy-rich region of the northwest North Atlantic, where a\n17% reduction occurs [Zhai and Greatbatch, 2007].\n[6] However, none of these results are based on observa-\ntions, and none include both the effects of currents and of\nair-sea temperature difference on wind stress. Since data are\nnow available which allow us to map time-mean (as well as\nvariable) currents, and wind stress, to much higher resolu-\ntion than was possible for the original Wunsch [1998] study,\nthis paper\u2019s aim is to provide an observational basis for this\neffect and an estimate of its size, together with an improved\nestimate of the total work done by wind on the geostrophic\nocean currents.\n[7] We do this in two ways, first using a (slightly\nextended) version of the DS formula to calculate the size\nof the effect to be expected by accounting for ocean\ncurrents. Secondly, we demonstrate that the effect can be\nseen explicitly in the observations by showing that inclusion\nof features in the scatterometer-measured wind stress data\nwhich occur at the oceanic mesoscale results in a reduction\nin power input from wind stress.\n2. Description of Data\n[8] We use daily wind stress measurements on a\n0.25! latitude-longitude grid from 13 October 1999 to\n11 October 2006 from the SeaWinds scatterometer on the\nQuikSCAT satellite. The instrument actually measures radar\nbackscatter which is modified by surface ripples generated\nby wind stress. In other words, QuickSCAT directly meas-\nures wind stress, including the effect of ocean currents, yet\nis calibrated against 10 metre wind measurements [Dunbar\net al., 2001; Chelton and Freilich, 2005]. Therefore the 10 m\nwind is the primary high-level output of the processing, but\nis actually a rescaled measure of wind stress, which is\nsubsequently calculated according to certain parameteriza-\ntions. We use the Large et al. [1994] wind-dependent\nparameterisation as described in the Appendix. It is worth\nnoting that the present (early 2007) PO.DAAC-published\nvalues of the Large et al. [1994] wind stress erroneously\nomit the factor of rA = 1.223, resulting in an underestimate\nof the wind stress.\n[9] We average the wind stress of the ascending pass over\n7-day periods centered on the time of the altimetry in order\nto provide the best spatial coverage of the 4 day repeat\nwhile keeping frequencies of atmospheric variability that\nmatch the highest frequencies resolved in the altimeter\nproduct used for currents. This also fills gaps due to\ncontamination of the scatterometer signal by precipitation\n(we count rain probability in excess of 30% as missing data\nwhich is typically less than 1% of points). We choose only\none pass (ascending) in order to avoid spurious horizontal\ngradients which are present when averaging both passes\nover a short time.\n[10] Ocean mean dynamic height is taken from the\nMaximenko and Niiler [2005] data set, which integrates\ninformation from surface drifters, satellite altimetry, surface\nwinds and the GRACE gravity mission [Tapley et al., 2003]\nfor the period 1992 to 2002. The data are provided on a\n1\/2! latitude-longitude grid and bilinearly interpolated to a\n1\/3! Mercator grid.\n[11] Time-varying sea level anomalies are obtained from\n7-day repeats of combined Topex\/Poseidon and ERS-1\/2\nsatellite altimetry [Ducet et al., 2000] from 13 October 1999\nto 11 October 2006 on a 1\/3! Mercator grid. This period is\nchosen to cover the largest number of whole years that\ncoincided with the wind stress measurements.\n[12] The 7-day ocean current is calculated by subtracting\nthe time-mean of the sea level anomalies for the period\n14 October 1992 to 9 October 2002 (the period used for the\nC02016 HUGHES AND WILSON: WIND WORK FROM SCATTEROMETER DATA\n2 of 10\nC02016\nmean dynamic height calculation) from the mean dynamic\nheight and then adding the 7-day sea level anomaly back on.\nThe daily 10 m wind is used to calculate daily wind stress,\nwith values corrupted by rain removed. Valid values of daily\nwind stress which fall within the 7-day bin centered on the\naltimetric period were then averaged to form a 7-day mean.\n[13] To calculate the power, P = t & v, the geostrophic\ncurrent is calculated using centered differences, and the 7-day\nwind stress is regridded to the altimetric current grid using\nbilinear interpolation. For time-mean quantities, we reject\nregions with 100 or fewer valid contributing time values (i.e.,\nthere must be valid values for more than approximately one\nquarter of the time.) This has most effect in regions which\nhave seasonal ice cover.\n[14] Both satellite products come with error estimates.\nFor wind speed, the pre-launch requirements were 2 ms!1\nRMS error for 3\u201320 ms!1 and 10% for 20\u201330 ms!1; for\nwind direction it is 20! for 3\u201330 ms!1. A post-launch\nassessment [Chelton and Freilich, 2005] suggests that the\nactual errors are better characterized by random component\nerrors of 0.75 ms!1 along-wind and 1.5 ms!1 across-wind.\nFor altimetry the error is spatially variable, but usually less\nthan 0.04 m. We have not attempted an error estimate for the\npower, as this depends (as we see below) in a complicated\nway on both spatial and temporal correlations which\ncannot be accounted for without much more detailed error\ncovariances.\n3. Results\n[15] The combination of scatterometer wind stress and\ncurrents from altimetry results in a total power input to the\ngeostrophic circulation of 0.76 TW, distributed as illustrated\nin Figure 1. The distribution with latitude is very similar to\nthat found by Wunsch [1998]: although the Southern Ocean\nis slightly less dominant, it still accounts for more than 60%\nof the total power input. Differences are greatest in the\ntropics, where a small Coriolis parameter means that small\nerrors in the mean sea surface can lead to substantial errors\nin the geostrophic current. The spatial patterns are very\nsimilar to those seen by VS, including those in the tropics.\nFollowing Wunsch and VS, we have omitted from our\ncalculation a band of 3! either side of the equator, because\nboth geostrophy and the concept of an Ekman layer break\ndown in this region. However, the power input is strong and\npositive either side of this gap. If we simply filled the gap\nby linear interpolation from north and south, we would get\napproximately 80 GW = 0.08 TWof extra power input from\nthis region.\n[16] The 0.76 TW power input is somewhat less than the\nestimates of 0.88 TW and 1.1 TW from Wunsch and from\nVS, respectively. The smaller value is consistent with the\nprediction of DS that the effect of currents should lead to a\nsmaller power input. The reduction is 14% compared to the\nWunsch estimate, and 31% compared to the VS result.\n[17] How much reduction should we expect? A formula is\nderived in DS for the difference in power resulting from the\neffect of currents on wind stress, but that formula assumes a\nconstant drag coefficient. Since the drag coefficient used in\nthe observations is not constant, we must use a slightly\ngeneralized formula, derived in the Appendix. In short, if\nwind at 10 m above the ocean is U, with amplitude U, and\ngeostrophic surface current is v with amplitude v, and with\ncomponent v0 along the direction of the wind, and if the\nwind stress is given by t = UF(U) when ignoring currents,\nand by t = Ur F(Ur) when accounting for currents (Ur =\nFigure 1. Wind work (10!3 Wm!2, left), its zonal integral (105 Wm!1, right, black), and normalized\ncumulative integral, starting at the southern boundary (right, red). The globally integrated value is shown\nin white.\nC02016 HUGHES AND WILSON: WIND WORK FROM SCATTEROMETER DATA\n3 of 10\nC02016\nU ! v), then the increase in power resulting from ignoring\nthe effect of currents can be written as\nPd \u00bc P1 ! P ' v2F U\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe UF 0 U\u00f0 \u00dev20; \u00f02\u00de\nwhere F0 = dF\/dU, and the approximation is accurate to O(!)\nwhere ! = v\/U. To this order it is irrelevant whether U or Ur\nis used in the formula. As an estimate of the size of !, we\ncalculated the ratio of root-mean square ocean current to\nroot-mean square wind speed. The result (not shown) is\nbelow 0.03 over a substantial fraction of the ocean, rising to\nabout 0.07 in areas of moderate eddy activity and peaking\naround 0.15 in the most energetic eddy regions as well as\nwithin about 5 degrees of the equator.\n[18] Given U and v, we can calculate all the terms in this\nequation. The result is shown in Figure 2. The total\ndifference is 189 GW (0.189 TW), and the spatial distribu-\ntion is clearly associated strongly with both mean and time-\ndependent ocean currents. The distribution with latitude is\nrather different from the total power P: the tropics now\ndominate the large-scale integrals, accounting for more than\nhalf of the difference term, although the Antarctic Circum-\npolar Current, the Gulf Stream, and the Kuroshio remain\nimportant. Two other zonal integrals are plotted in Figure 2:\nan integral based on a calculation using spatially smoothed\nwind stress (using a 5! box-car filter), and an integral based\non a calculation using spatially smoothed currents (the same\nfilter). It is clear, as expected, that the small scales in the\nwind stress make little difference to the estimate, but that\nsmall scales in the currents are crucial.\n[19] It is informative to break down the various terms in\n(2) to determine how important the details are. If correla-\ntions between wind and current are unimportant in the\nformula, then it could be approximated by\nPd1 \u00bc !Fv2 \u00fe UF 0v20; \u00f03\u00de\nwhere an overline represents a time average. Furthermore, if\nthe directions of currents and winds are not correlated, then\na typical value of v0\n2 would be half of v2, since a randomly\nchosen component should represent a fraction 1\/\nffiffiffi\n2\np\nof the\ntotal amplitude, which allows a further approximation:\nPd2 \u00bc v2 !F \u00fe UF 0=2\n! \"\n: \u00f04\u00de\nFinally, if we assume that eddy kinetic energy dominates\nover kinetic energy of the mean flow, then we have a third\napproximation:\nPd3 \u00bc v02 !F \u00fe UF 0=2\n! \"\n; \u00f05\u00de\nwhere v0 represents the amplitude of the difference between\ninstantaneous current velocity and time-averaged current\nvelocity.\n[20] Zonal integrals based on the full formula, and on\nthese three approximations, are shown in Figure 3. It is clear\nfrom these that details of the correlations are not important,\nand that most of Pd (more than 75%) is the result of eddy\nrather than mean kinetic energy. What is meant by eddy\nkinetic energy varies rather a lot with latitude though. As\nVS point out, much of the time dependence in the tropics is\nseasonal, whereas the midlatitude time dependence is more\ndominated by mesoscale eddies and meanders of the jets. It\nseems that a power difference estimate of about 0.19 TW is\nFigure 2. Increase in wind work resulting from ignoring the effect of ocean currents based on\ngeneralized DS estimate, Pd ' v2 F(U) + UF0(U)v02 (10!3 Wm!2, left). Its zonal integral is shown in\nblack (105 Wm!1, right), as are those for the same estimate with 5! smoothed wind (blue) and 5!\nsmoothed current (red).\nC02016 HUGHES AND WILSON: WIND WORK FROM SCATTEROMETER DATA\n4 of 10\nC02016\nfairly robust, depending only on the amplitudes of currents\nand of two functions of the broad wind stress. In fact this is\nprobably an underestimate of the effect, since increasing the\nresolution of the current measurements can only lead to an\nincrease in kinetic energy (although removal of any noise\nfrom the currents would produce a decrease).\n[21] Simply adding the difference of approximately 0.19\nTW to the total measured value of 0.76 TW gives a total of\n0.95 TW as the value which would be calculated given\nmeasurements of the winds but ignoring the effect of\ncurrents on wind stress. This lies comfortably between the\nWunsch and VS estimates, which do ignore this effect.\nHowever, this simple calculation assumes that the DS effect\nis fully captured (to the resolution of the currents used) by\nthe observations. There are several reasons why this might\nnot be the case. Although the effect of ocean currents is\ncertainly captured by the scatterometer measurements, cap-\nturing the DS effect requires that wind stress and current\nmeasurements be matched well-enough in time and space\nfor the mesoscale features in both currents and wind stresses\nto be aligned. It is possible that this sampling requirement\nwill not be met, in which case the anticorrelation between\nmesoscale wind stress and currents, responsible for the DS\neffect, will be diluted. There is also an issue of whether the\nDS effect is the dominant effect of the ocean mesoscale on\npower. Chelton et al. [2004] found surface temperature\neffects to be as important as current effects in their influence\non wind stress. It is possible that these also have an\nintegrated effect on power, although we should expect more\ncancellation of the temperature effect since it tends to\ndifferentiate between the warm and cold sides of a jet rather\nthan between the jet and its surroundings as for the current\neffect (most extratropical jets have a warm and a cold side,\nalthough the Gulf Stream, for example, advects a tongue of\nwarm water along its core, making the jet warmer than its\nsurroundings: in these circumstances, a systematic temper-\nature effect is to be expected).\n[22] In order to test whether the observations do capture\nthe DS effect, we recalculated the power input using\nspatially smoothed wind stress. The assumption is that this\nwill filter out the imprint of mesoscale ocean processes on\nthe wind stress, thus removing most of the DS effect,\nalthough the part of the DS effect which is due to larger-\nscale ocean currents will remain. Smoothing the currents\nrather than wind stress achieves the same effect, and\nproduces very similar integral values. Note, however, that\nwe cannot distinguish here between mesoscale effects due\nto currents and those due to sea surface temperature.\n[23] Each 7-day average wind stress field from the\nscatterometer was subjected to a 3!, 5! or 10! box-car\nsmoothing before taking the product with the current\n(smoothing is performed on a Mercator grid, so that the\nsmoother is 3!, 5! or 10! in longitude, and the same distance\nin km in latitude, giving a square smoothing region). The\neffect of this smoothing is to reduce the strength of the wind\nstress slightly, since a part of the true 10 m wind is filtered\nout by this smoothing (large-scale averages of the reduction\nin time-averaged wind stress strength for 5! smoothing are\naround 5\u201315%, part of which is due to the DS effect and\npart due to the smoothing of the winds themselves; the\nreduction is smallest in the tropics), and to filter out the part\nof the wind stress which is associated with small-scale\noceanic processes. Despite the reduction in wind stress,\nthe effect of this smoothing is to increase the power into the\nocean, by about 49 GW with 3! smoothing and by 60 GW\nwith 5! smoothing, although the effect begins to decrease\nwith 10! smoothing which leads to only a 26 GW increase\nas the winds are damped out more strongly by this degree of\nsmoothing. The spatial distribution of the difference result-\ning from 5! smoothing is shown in Figure 4. As expected\nfrom DS, the midlatitude power increase is strongest where\nthe surface kinetic energy is greatest. The effect is, however,\nmuch weaker than expected in the tropics.\n[24] Another feature which is apparent in Figure 4 is the\nappearance of dipoles across a number of jets. This is\nclearest for the Gulf Stream, the tips of Madagascar, and a\nnumber of topographically steered jets in the Antarctic\nCircumpolar Current. If the DS effect was the only effect\nof the ocean mesoscale on wind stress, then we would\nexpect the values in Figure 4 to be everywhere positive. In\nFigure 3. Zonal integral of Pd ' v2F U\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe UF 0 U\u00f0 \u00dev20\n(black) and its approximations, whose relevance is de-\nscribed in the text: Pd1 = !F v2 + UF 0 v20 (blue), Pd2 = v2 (!F +\nUF 0\/2) (red) and Pd3 = v\n02 (!F + UF 0\/2) (green) (105 Wm!1).\nThe black and blue lines are almost indistinguishable.\nC02016 HUGHES AND WILSON: WIND WORK FROM SCATTEROMETER DATA\n5 of 10\nC02016\nfact, the dipole regions are consistent with the influence of\nsea surface temperature. When the wind and jet are both\n(roughly) eastward, as in the midlatitude regions, there is a\nlarger wind stress on the warm (equatorward) side and a\nsmaller wind stress on the cold (poleward) side of the jet.\nThis produces a reduction of power into the ocean on the\npoleward side of the jet, and an increase on the equatorward\nside. Since the effect of the mesoscale is the negative of the\nquantity plotted in Figure 4, the signs of the dipoles are\nconsistent with this interpretation.\n[25] Using smoothed wind stress is not a perfect way of\nassessing the DS effect, since it does not remove all of the\neffect of ocean currents on wind stress (not all currents\nintegrate to zero over a 5! box), and it removes some fine\nscales which may be due to winds. An independent check\ncan be made in regions dominated by mesoscale eddies by\nconsidering the time-dependent component of the power\ninput, i.e., by looking at the term t 0 & v0 = t & v ! !t & !v,\nwhere an overline represents a time average, and prime\nrepresents deviations from the time average. The reason for\nexamining this quantity is that, if winds and currents are\nuncorrelated in time, then the covariance between wind\nstress and current represents the DS effect resulting from the\ntime-dependent part of the current. As noted above, this\nrepresents more than 75% of the total DS effect. Of course it\nis not always true that winds and currents are uncorrelated,\nindeed many currents are wind-driven, and in these regions\nwe would expect t 0 & v0 to be positive. This is the case in the\ndiagnostics of Wunsch [1998] and VS, who find a positive\nglobal integral of this term (39 GW for the Wunsch\nobservations, about 65 GW for the model considered by\nWunsch, and 140 GW for VS). However, where the time-\ndependent current is dominated by more stochastic meso-\nscale eddies and meanders, the result of intrinsic instability\nprocesses rather than direct atmospheric forcing, the DS\neffect should dominate and the term should become negative.\n[26] Figure 5a shows this time-dependent term. At first\nglance, the result looks very similar to Figure 2 of VS.\nStrong positive and negative contributions occur in the\ntropics, with the positive contribution (representing wind-\ndriven currents) dominating. A positive contribution simi-\nlarly predominates around many continental margins, again\nindicative of wind-driven currents (although the temperature\neffect may also be important here, as wind stress is also\ncorrelated with temperature signals via upwelling in many\nregions). The regions of strong mesoscale variability show\nvery patchy power distributions, as in VS. Closer inspec-\ntion, however, shows that there is a bias to negative\ncontributions in these regions, which shows clearly in the\nzonal integrals. This is even more clear in Figure 5b, which\nis the same as Figure 5a, but with a 5! smoother applied. It\nis now very clear that the term is negative in regions\ndominated by mesoscale variability.\n[27] While the total value of t 0 & v0 remains positive, it is a\nvery small 9.3 GW. This represents a cancellation between\nthe effects of wind-driven currents and the DS effect, with\nthe DS effect dominating in midlatitudes and wind-driven\ncurrents dominating in the tropics. The integral between\n20!S and 20!N is 39 GW, equal to Wunsch\u2019s global integral.\nWunsch\u2019s calculation (his Figure 3) does show negative\nvalues in the Southern Ocean, but these are not associated\nwith regions of mesoscale variablity and are not seen by VS.\nA re-examination of the data used shows unusual currents\nalong the ice edge. A likely reason for the negative values is\nthus a problem with the flagging of ice when using the\naltimeter data (C. Wunsch, personal communication, 2007).\nAs the negative band is partially offset by a nearby erroneous\nFigure 4. Increase in wind work when wind stress is smoothed by 5! tsm5 & v ! t & v (10!3 Wm!2, left),\nits zonal integral (105 Wm!1, right, black), and normalized cumulative integral, starting at the southern\nboundary (right, red).\nC02016 HUGHES AND WILSON: WIND WORK FROM SCATTEROMETER DATA\n6 of 10\nC02016\npositive band, this only contributes a small effect (less than\n2 GW) to the total.\n[28] We thus have clear evidence that the combined\nsampling of altimetry and scatterometer data are sufficient\nto capture the DS effect in midlatitude regions, especially\nwhere the currents are dominated by mesoscale variability.\nThe evidence is much less clear in the tropics. We quantify\nthis in Figure 6a, in which we superimpose zonal integrals\nof various measures of the DS effect on power. The black\ncurve represents a DS-based prediction of the effect we\nshould see from ocean currents on scales smaller than 5!.\nThis is produced by using the full DS prediction (black line\nFigure 5. a) Time-dependent component of wind work, t 0 & v0 (10!3 Wm!2, left) and its zonal integral\n(105 Wm!1, right). b) The same component with 5! post-smoothing (10!3 Wm!2).\nC02016 HUGHES AND WILSON: WIND WORK FROM SCATTEROMETER DATA\n7 of 10\nC02016\nin Figure 2), and subtracting from it the DS prediction based\non 5!-smoothed currents (red line in Figure 2). In blue, we\nhave the actual effect of applying 5! smoothing to the wind\nstress (as in Figure 4), and in red we have the negative of the\ntime-dependent term shown in Figure 5a (i.e., !t 0 & v0). In\nmidlatitude regions, the observed effect of smoothing the\nwind stress comes close to the DS-based prediction (typi-\ncally 75%, as seen from the ratio plotted in Figure 6b). The\ntime-dependent term captures a slightly smaller DS effect in\nthese mesoscale-dominated regions, as expected.\n[29] This high percentage at midlatitudes, despite the fact\nthat smoothing the wind stress also removes a part of the\nwind effect on wind stress as well as part of the current\neffect, and despite the imperfectly matched sampling of the\nscatterometer and altimeter, clearly demonstrates that the\nDS effect is operating at midlatitudes, and that the combi-\nnation of scatterometer and altimeter data is capturing most\nof this effect. This makes the discrepancy in the tropics all\nthe more surprising.\n[30] We have been unable to identify a clear reason for\nthis difference in the tropics. Figure 4 does show strong\nnegative contributions close to central America, which\nrelate to small-scale patterns in wind stress which are\nassociated with topographic steering of the winds rather\nthan with ocean influences [Chelton et al., 2004], but\nexcising this area from the calculation only leads to an\nincrease of about 2 GW. Winds in the tropics do not seem to\nbe more strongly affected than elsewhere by 5! smoothing\n(the opposite, in fact), and strong positive tropical regions in\nFigure 4 seem to match quite well with the DS-based\npredictions in Figure 2. The main tropical reduction appears\nfrom Figure 4 to come from a broad band of moderate\nnegative values occurring in the open ocean.\n[31] Having said this, our method suffers from more\ncomplications in the tropics than elsewhere. There is not\nsuch a great separation in scales between ocean currents and\natmospheric winds, the winds and currents are strongly\ncorrelated in space and time, there is a strong seasonal\ncycle, rapid ocean adjustment processes in this region may\nmean that the sampling mismatch between instruments is a\nmore acute problem, and the region is close to the band in\nwhich geostrophic flow is masked out on approaching the\nequator, which complicates the effect of smoothing and\nincreases the noise from the altimeter measurements. It is\npossible that our failure to confirm the DS effect in the\ntropics is a result of not properly accounting for these\ncomplications.\n[32] The broad negative bands seen in Figure 4, however,\nsuggest that this may be a real effect. Given the importance\nof seasonal cycles in this region, and the different relation-\nship between currents and sea surface temperature from that\nseen in the mesoscale-dominated midlatitudes, one possi-\nbility is that the DS effect in this region is masked by the\neffect of ocean-atmosphere temperature difference on wind\nstress, which may correlate more strongly with currents here\nthan elsewhere. Resolution of these issues will require\nfurther studies which are beyond the scope of the present\nwork.\n[33] In conclusion, we can clearly see the DS effect at\nwork in midlatitudes, as a result of which the total power\ncalculated from a combination of altimetry and scatterom-\neter data is smaller than it would otherwise be. We cannot,\nhowever, clearly demonstrate whether or not the DS effect\nin the tropics has been properly accounted for by these\nmeasurements. The effect of currents is certainly accounted\nfor in the scatterometer data, but we have no clear demon-\nstration that the necessary matching of sampling between\nscatterometer and altimeter data has been achieved in this\nregion.\n4. Summary and Conclusions\n[34] We summarize in Table 1 the various power inputs\nand contributions to power input calculated in this work,\ngiving global integrals and values integrated over a South-\nern latitude range 80!S\u201320!S, a Tropical range 20!S\u201320!N\n(excluding 3!S\u20133!N), and a Northern range 20!N\u201380!N.\n[35] The headline figure is a global total of 760 GW\n(0.76 TW), calculated by taking the time-mean dot product\nof scatterometer-derived wind stress and surface geostroph-\nic currents from satellite altimetry. This is smaller than the\nvalues calculated by Wunsch [1998] and VS, but the large\ncontribution of the Southern Ocean is still apparent, with the\nFigure 6. a) Zonal integrals of the DS effect on power\n(105 Wm!1): DS-based prediction of the effect we should\nsee by applying 5! smoothing to the wind stress (black),\nproduced by subtracting the DS prediction based on 5!-\nsmoothed currents (red line in Figure 2) from the full DS\nprediction (black line in Figure 2); the actual effect of\napplying 5! smoothing to the wind stress (blue), as in Figure\n4; the negative of the time-dependent power component\n(i.e., !t 0 & v0) (red). b) The ratio of the actual effect of\napplying 5! smoothing to the wind stress to the DS-based\nprediction of the effect we should see by applying 5!\nsmoothing to the wind stress (black).\nC02016 HUGHES AND WILSON: WIND WORK FROM SCATTEROMETER DATA\n8 of 10\nC02016\nSouthern region accounting for more than 60% of the total\npower.\n[36] Rather counterintuitively, if we recalculate this power\ninput using smoothed wind stresses (or smoothed currents),\nthe total power into the ocean apparently increases. This is\nin fact in line with the predictions of DS, who showed that\naccounting for surface currents in the calculation of wind\nstress results in a significant reduction in power compared to\nthe case in which the current is not accounted for (the latter\ncase being approximated by our smoothed wind stresses).\nThe total power increase based on 5! smoothing is 60 GW.\n[37] We derived a slight generalization of a formula due\nto DS which makes it possible to calculate the expected size\nof the DS effect using a more realistic form for the drag\ncoefficient. This led to a predicted total of 189 GW, which\nreduces to 149 GW if the effect of currents on scales larger\nthan 5! is excluded. The observed effect of 60 GW is 40%\nof this. We showed that the DS calculation is robust, and\ndoes not depend strongly on details of correlations between\nthe terms involved, or on small-scale features in the winds\nused.\n[38] Looking at the way in which these results vary with\nlatitude reveals an interesting picture. In the Southern region\nthe apparent power continues to increase even as the\neffective resolution of the wind stress is reduced by up to\n10! smoothing. In the Northern region, it increases up to 5!\nsmoothing, but decreases (although remaining higher than\nthe unsmoothed case) with 10! smoothing, and in the\nTropical region 3! smoothing produces the greatest (but\nstill small) increase, with 10! smoothing producing a\ndecrease compared with the unsmoothed case. This is in\ncontrast to the DS prediction, which predicts the largest\neffect in the Tropical region. As a result, the observations\nbased on 5! smoothing of wind stress capture 71% of the\npredicted DS effect in the Southern region, 62% in\nthe Northern region, but only 9% in the Tropical region.\nThe distribution of the time dependent term t 0 & v0 is also\nconsistent with expectations of the DS effect in regions\ndominated by mesoscale variability.\n[39] Given that the measured power decreases as the\nresolution of wind stress measurements increases (as\nexpected from DS), it is safe to conclude that the total\npower would be less than 760 GW given perfect resolution\nand perfectly matched sampling. As the DS effect is clearly\nevident in these observations in the Northern and Southern\nregions, we would expect a calculation based on the same\ncurrents, but on wind stresses derived by ignoring ocean\ncurrents, to produce values at least 92 GW larger (the\ncombination of DS predictions for Northern and Southern\nregions), giving at least 852 GW. If the reason for our\ninability to detect the DS effect in the Tropical region is, as\nwe suspect, that there are other ocean influences on wind\nstress in this region which counteract the DS effect, then we\ncan also say that we have accounted for the DS effect in the\nTropical observations, and that a calculation based on wind\nstresses which ignore ocean currents would result in an\nincrease of power by the full DS prediction of 189 GW, to\n949 GW.\n[40] These values lie close to those found by Wunsch\n[1998], from both a coarse resolution observational study\nand a model-based calculation, but are still below the value\nof 1.1 TW found in another model study by VS. It is not\nclear why VS found such a large value, but one place to\nlook might be the Southern Ocean. This is a region which is\nnotoriously difficult to model well, and is the dominant\nregion for power input. Indeed, Wunsch [1998] noted that\nthe main difference between his observational and model-\nbased estimates was that the Southern Ocean peak in the\nmodel-based estimate was significantly smaller. This is\nsurprising, given that the model concerned [Semtner and\nChervin, 1992] produced a rather large circumpolar trans-\nport of about 200 Sv. Equally, the Southern Ocean might be\na good place to look for errors in the mean flow used in this\nobservational study, especially as the drifter data used are\nmore prone to systematic effects due to winds and waves\nhere than elsewhere [Niiler et al., 2003]. However, the use\nof a combination of altimetry and satellite gravity data to\nconstrain the large scales should greatly reduce this source\nof error in the data set used here [Maximenko and Niiler,\n2005].\n[41] To summarize, subject to unknown systematic errors\nin the data sets used, we find that 760 GW is an upper limit\non the power input to the geostrophic ocean circulation by\nwind stress. We would expect a calculation which ignores\nthe DS effect to produce a larger power of between about\n850 and 950 GW (the larger number being the case if, as we\nsuspect, the DS effect in the Tropical region is accounted for\nin our calculation, but masked in our diagnostics by other\neffects). We find clear evidence for the operation of the DS\neffect in midlatitude regions, but the picture appears to be\nmore complicated in the tropics.\nAppendix A\n[42] DS derived a formula (their equation (A1)) for the\nexcess power apparently input into the ocean as a result of\nignoring the ocean current in the formulation for wind\nstress. In our notation, this formula is given in the Intro-\nduction as (1). This was derived by assuming a constant\ndrag coefficient, and by neglecting terms which are smaller\nTable 1.

It is clear that this power excess\nis positive definite.\n[43] For our calculation using scatterometer data, we use\nthe Large et al. [1994] formula for the drag coefficient: rAcd =\na\/U + b + gU, where a = 0.00270rA, b = 0.000142rA, and\ng = 0.0000764rA, with rA = 1.223 following the usage in\nscatterometer processing (all numerical values are for S.I.\nunits). This allows us to write the wind stress as\nt \u00bc U rF Ur\u00f0 \u00de; \u00f0A1\u00de\nwhere Ur = U ! v is the difference between 10 m wind and\nocean current, and the approximate stress ignoring the ocean\ncurrent is then\nt1 \u00bc UF U\u00f0 \u00de; \u00f0A2\u00de\nwith F(U) = a + bU + gU2. The approximation used by DS\nis equivalent to setting a = g = 0.\n[44] We wish to derive an equivalent to (1), but using the\nmore complicated wind stress formulation. We start with\nP1 ! P \u00bc t1 ! t\u00f0 \u00de & v \u00bc F U\u00f0 \u00de ! F Ur\u00f0 \u00de\u00f0 \u00deU & v\u00fe v2F Ur\u00f0 \u00de:\n\u00f0A3\u00de\nWe then note that F(U) ! F(Ur) = F0(Ur)(U ! Ur)(1 +\nO(!)), where F0(Ur) = dF\/dUr, and that U ! Ur = v0(1 +\nO(!)) (recalling that v0 is the component of v along the\ndirection of U, so that U & v = Uv0). Substituting these then\ngives\nP1 !

This generalized formula is positive defi-\nnite as long as F0(U) is positive, which it is for the form of F\nconsidered here and for other reasonable forms, although it\nis possible that it becomes negative at wind speeds of\naround 40 ms!1 [Jarosz et al., 2007].\n[46] Acknowledgments.
