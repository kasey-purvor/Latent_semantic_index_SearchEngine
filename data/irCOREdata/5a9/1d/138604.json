Introduction  \nOver the years, increasing attention has been paid to the sustainable development \nof the aviation sector. More and more, environmental and social concerns are \nposing severe limitations to the growth of the air transport industry. Although the \nglobal economic downturn and political turmoil has caused a decline in the \nnumber of flights and passengers over the past two years, these concerns remain \nvalid as traffic gets back to its pre-9\/11 trend. \nIt is now widely recognised that the costs of these externalities must be \ninternalised and paid for by the aviation industry and its users (EC 1999, 2002).  \nTwo of the most important externalities generated from commercial flights are \nnoise nuisance and aircraft engine emissions. Of these two, noise nuisance has the \nlargest impact on the community surrounding airports, while engine emissions \nhave both local and global impacts.  \nNoise causes both nuisance and health effects, for instance sleep deprivation. \nMore and more airports in the world, often forced by governments, have applied \n  \n   3 \ndifferent types of noise management measures that range from noise abatement \nprocedures to limits on the total noise allowed. Among these measures are night \nflight restrictions and curfews, night quotas, and noise charges and penalties. In \n1999, only 10 out of the 25 enlarged European Union countries, Norway and \nSwitzerland had some forms of noise charges (Lu 2000); by 2003 all 27 countries \nhad noise related charges (Boeing 2003). \nAircraft engine emissions have extensive impact on human health, vegetation, \nmaterials, ecosystem and the climate.  Aircraft exhaust pollutants are emitted \nduring landing and take-off (LTO), ground stages and during the cruise mode of \nflights.  Damage is incurred from these pollutants at all flight stages and aircraft \nare unusual in their injection of pollutants into the upper troposphere and lower \nstratosphere, resulting in a higher level of global warming than is the case for \nsimilar ground level emissions.  Compared to the introduction of noise \nmanagement measures, there are fewer airports applying engine emissions \nmitigation measures. In 1999, engine emissions charges are in place only at some \nSwiss and Swedish airports (Morrell & Lu 2000). In 2003, no other airports had \nintroduced these charges (Boeing 2003). These charges are targeted only at local \nemissions; the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) is working on \nmeasures targeting on the emissions during cruise mode (ICAO 1996, 1998). \nGiven this context, this paper provides a framework in which to assess the \nenvironmental cost of airport operations. The environmental cost consists of noise \nsocial costs and aircraft emissions costs. The noise social cost depends heavily on \nthe density of the population surrounding the airport, whilst, engine emissions \n  \n   4 \nvary according to the number of flights and the aircraft types used at an airport. \nThe calculation of environmental costs can be used in various types of analyses.  \nThe methodology can serve as a common basis for the determination of unit noise \ncharges in the noise charge calculation formula proposed by the European \nCommission (EC 2002).  Furthermore, the results can be used to assess the \nenvironmental impact of airport expansion plans and traffic forecasts. The \nenvironmental costs can also be compared with the social and economic benefits \nof an airport in order to assess the relationship between the airport and the \nsurrounding region. This allows the assessment of whether growth at the airport \nwould result in more environmental cost than it would yield economic benefit.   \nThis paper presents a methodology for calculating the noise and emission \nsocial costs.  The empirical analysis is carried out for three British airports \n(London-Heathrow, London-Gatwick and London-Stansted airports) and two \nDutch airports (Amsterdam Airport Schiphol and Maastricht Airport).  Various \napplications of the environmental cost results are addressed and investigated.  \nConclusions are discussed in the final section. \n \n2. Noise social cost estimation: methodology and model \nThe most commonly used techniques for estimating noise damage costs are \nhedonic price methods (HPM) and contingent valuation methods (Pearce & \nMarkandya 1989; Lu & Morrell 2001).  The former is based on revealed \nbehaviour and the latter on stated preferences.  The HPM has been more fully \ndeveloped and adopted by policy makers (UK DfT 2003; Pearce & Pearce 2000; \n  \n   5 \nNelson 2004) as apposed to contingent valuation methods (Carlsson et al. 2004).  \nHence, the HPM is applied here for calculating the aircraft noise social cost. \nThis method is based on the household equilibrium marginal willingness to \npay.  It is used to extract the implicit prices of certain characteristics that \ndetermine property values. Examples are location, attributes of the neighbourhood \nand community, as well as environmental quality (Johansson 1987; Nelson 1980, \n1981).  For this approach, however, it is necessary to assume that each individual \nhas the same utility function, in order to obtain the unique price estimation for \nnoise impacts (Pearce & Edwards 1979).   \nBy using the hedonic price method, the annual total noise social cost nC is \nderived from the following formula: \niaiv\ni\nNDIn HNNPIC )( 0\u2212=\u2211  (1) \nWhere NDII  is the noise depreciation index (NDI) expressed as a percentage; \nvP  is the annual average house rent in the vicinity of the airport and vNDI PI  is the \nannual noise social cost per residence per A-Weighted decibel (dB(A)).  The noise \nlevel above the ambient level is ( )0NN ai \u2212 , where aiN  is the average noise for \nthe i-th section of the noise contour\n1\n; 0N  is the background noise or the ambient \nnoise, the level at which no residents are defined to suffer serious noise \ndisturbance.  This is finally multiplied by iH , the number of residences within the \ni-th zone of the noise contour. \n                                                 \n1\n   The definition of noise contour is: a line of a constant value of a noise index around an airport, \ndue to the noise of a traffic mix of aeroplanes under normal operating conditions and using \nnormal flight paths (ICAO 1988).   \n  \n   6 \nThe NDI or the percentage reduction of house price per dB(A) above \nbackground noise, is derived from various studies using regression functions.  The \nannual house rent vP  is converted from the average house value in the vicinity of \nthe airport by the mortgage interest rate and the average house lifetime. \nIt should be noted that the noise level versus annoyance curve takes the form of \na non-linear relationship; the higher the level of noise, the increasingly greater \nannoyance (Finegold et al. 1994; Schultz 1978).  Therefore, vNDI PI  in equation (1) \nis adjusted by the noise versus annoyance function in order to reflect the real noise \nnuisance imposed on the residents surrounding the airport.   \nAfter calculating the aggregate noise social cost, the next question is how to \nallocate this total external cost to individual flights.  The principle of this process \nshould be based on the real impact of noise nuisance on the residents, generated \ndynamically from each specific flight.  The factors influencing the noise impact \ninclude aircraft types, engine types, time of a day, flight paths as well as landing \nand take-off procedures.  The reduction in the amount of noise from the LTO for a \ncertain aircraft\/engine combination could be considered as the marginal noise \nnuisance caused by this flight.  The corresponding noise index for different \naircraft\/engine combinations could then de derived (Lu 2000; Swan 1998). \n \n3. Engine emissions social cost estimation: methodology and model  \nDifferences in aircraft operation and engine types, emission rates and airport \ncongestion are considered as important parameters influencing the damage level \nof pollutants.  The air pollution at ground level resulting from the landing and \n  \n   7 \ntake-off of flights is considered in this paper along with the climate impacts \nduring the 30-minute cruise stage prior to landing or after take-off, as these phases \nresult in direct impacts within the region surrounding the airport.   \nThe calculation of the engine emissions social cost uses the opposite approach \nfrom the calculation of noise costs.  First, the social costs for individual aircraft \nmovements with specific engine type and standard flight modes are derived, \napplying the unit social cost for each pollutant.  Second, the annual social cost is \ndetermined by summing across the annual aircraft movements and emissions \ninventory. \nijF , the amount (kilograms) of the jth pollutant emitted during the ith flight \nmode, can be derived from the following formula: \nijiiij eftF =  (2) \nWhere it  is the time spent during the ith mode (hours); if  the fuel flow during \nthe ith mode (kg\/hr); ije  the emission indices of the jth pollutant during the ith \nmode (kg pollutant\/kg fuel).  Equation (3) shows the calculation of ekC , the social \ncost per flight for the kth engine\/aircraft combination (\u20ac\/flight): \njij\nj i\niek UFC \u2211\u2211\n= =\n=\n6\n1\n5\n1\n\u03b1  (3) \nWhere i\u03b1  is the weight for each mode (depending on the damage multiplier \nfactor: for example 3 for cruise; 1 for the other phases of flight and ground \nmovement, which means the same pollutant causes 3 times larger damage when \nemitted during cruise (IPCC 1999).); jU  is the unit social cost for the jth pollutant \n  \n   8 \n(\u20ac\/kg).  Five operational modes are calculated separately, which are take-off, \nclimb-out, approach, taxi\/idle and cruise. Finally the annual emissions social cost, \neC , is computed as follows: \n\u2211=\nk\nekke CDC  (4) \nWhere kD  is the total number of the annual aircraft landings for the kth \nengine\/aircraft combination. \nThe unit social costs, jU , are determined by Lu (2000) and are based on an \nextensive review of the literature (Pearce & Pearce 2000; Levinson et al. 1998; \nEyre et al. 1997; Perl et al. 1997; Mayeres et al. 1996).  The mean values of the \nsocial costs for each pollutant are taken from previous studies.  In the literature, \nenvironmental costs are estimated in monetary terms; they are based on the \nrelationship between pollution and damages on human health, vegetation, \nbuildings, climate change and global warming. This method traces the links \nbetween air emissions and adverse consequences, considered as the best proved \nmethod for evaluating the social cost of emissions (Small & Kazimi 1995).   \nPollutants taken into account in the take-off and landing stages of flight are \nHC, CO, NOx, SO2, CO2 and N2O. Others such as fine particles are not included \ndue to the uncertainties of their local and global impacts.  For the damage caused \nin cruise, CO2, CH4, NOx and water vapour in conjunction with particles (leading \nto contrails and the formation of cirrus clouds), have been found to have a \nsignificant impact on climate change.  The impacts from these emissions are still \nsubject to wide ranges of possible damage, both because of the lack of knowledge \n  \n   9 \nof the physical processes and the different discount rates used to determine \npresent value marginal cost (IPCC 1999; Peper 1994; Schippers 2004).  Hence, \nthe cruise damage has been limited to NOx, for which reasonable estimates of \nimpacts are available within an acceptable range of uncertainty (Archer 1993). \n \n4.  Case studies: data and assumptions \nThree British airports (London-Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports) and two \nDutch airports (Amsterdam Airport Schiphol and Maastricht Airport) are taken as \nthe case studies for the empirical analysis.  Based on the aircraft noise \nclassification used at Heathrow Airport, aircraft types are categorised into seven \ncategories, with a representative aircraft type being selected for each of the \ncategories, as shown in Table 1.  The various aircraft types for different categories \nare listed in Appendix A.  \n(Insert Table 1) \nTable 2 presents the aircraft movements by category in 2001 at these five \nairports.  Heathrow has the highest number of aircraft movements, followed by \nSchiphol, Gatwick, Stansted and Maastricht.   \n(Insert Table 2) \nTables 3 and 4 show the number of residences within each noise contour zone, \nwhich is calculated using the fleet mix and number of movements in 2001.  \nDifferent noise measurements are used in these two countries: Leq is used in the \nUK; Kosten Unit (KU) in the Netherlands.  Heathrow has more than 100 thousand \nresidences within the 57 Leq noise contour; Schiphol also has around 122 \n  \n   10\nthousand residences located within the 20 Ku noise contour in the vicinity of the \nairport. The 57 Leq and the 20 Ku noise contours are the lowest noise levels \nmeasured. Although Maastricht has the least aircraft movements (Table 2), there \nare more residences affected by noise nuisance than those at Gatwick and Stansted \n(Tables 3 and 4).   \n(Insert Table 3) \n(Insert Table 4) \nThe average NDI value concluded from a number of research papers is within \n0.60-0.62% with Noise Exposure Forecast (NEF) as a noise descriptor\n2\n (Schippers \n2004).  KU used in the Netherlands ranges from 20 to 65 KU, which is 1.5 times \nthe range compared to NEF\u2019s 20-50.  Therefore, the NDI value is adjusted to \n0.40% for the calculation of noise social costs at Dutch airports.  On the other \nhand, based on the narrower range of the Leq system, the NDI value is set at \n1.00% for the UK airports.  The average house prices at the airport area are listed \nin Table 5.  Table 6 presents the unit social costs for each of the pollutants from \nengine emissions as an average for the local impacts and the climate change \nimpact. \n(Insert Table 5) \n(Insert Table 6) \n \n5. Case studies: empirical results \nThe social costs calculation is based on the annual airport movements, the current \n                                                 \n2\n NEF (Noise Exposure Forecast), one of the cumulative noise event measures, reasonably varying \nbetween 20-50, was mostly used in the United States prior to the development of the Ldn index. \n  \n   11\nfleet mix and the number of residences annoyed, which means that the cost level \nvaries as the endogenous or exogenous parameters are changed.  For example, if \nairlines reduce the number of flights to an airport, or change the types of engines \nfor some aircraft types, the annual number of movements from the airport will be \nlower and different levels of emissions are generated.  The corresponding \nenvironmental cost is different in order to accurately and dynamically reflect the \nreal social cost of aircraft emissions.  Furthermore, if the characteristics in the \nvicinity of the airport changed, the cost level would vary correspondingly.  For \ninstance, the more noise insulation investment (recycling the charges collected), \nthe less annoyance the residents would incur.  In this case, even with the same \nnumber of flights, the perceived noise nuisance of the airport would be reduced. \n \n5.1 Noise social costs \nThe calculation results of equation (1) for noise social costs at the current \naggregate noise level are presented in Table 7.  The noise social costs for different \naircraft categories at Heathrow vary from \u20ac28 per landing for Jetstream to \u20ac3,007 \nfor B747-100F\/200\/300\/SP, with the weighted average of \u20ac774 per landing and \ntake-off (or \u20ac387 per movement).  The average noise social cost at Schiphol, \nalthough having similar aircraft movements to Heathrow, appears to be \u20ac377 per \nlanding, less than half of that at Heathrow.  On the other hand, Maastricht, with \nthe least aircraft movements, but situated in a more densely populated area, has \nhigher noise social costs than Gatwick and Stansted.   \n(Insert Table 7) \n  \n   12\n \n5.2 Engine emissions social costs \nThe social cost of engine emissions has been calculated on the basis of \nassumptions on engine types and emission rates. These assumptions are necessary \nbecause of limitations in data availability and because further complexity in terms \nof using every actual aircraft\/engine combination would not result in significantly \ngreater accuracy.  Therefore, substituting the related parameters and data in \nequations (2), (3) and (4) (ICAO 1995), the average social cost per landing for \neach aircraft type is shown in Table 8.  As the impacts of engine emissions are \nless airport-specific (or at least little is known on their subsequent dispersion \naround the airport), the social costs for individual aircraft types are assumed the \nsame for all five airports. \n(Insert Table 8) \nThe figures in Table 8 include not only the social cost at the ground level \nresulting from the standard LTO procedures, including take-off, climb-out, \napproach and taxi-idle modes, but also the costs of the emissions from 30 \nminutes\u2019 cruise either prior to landing or following take-off.  The engine \nemissions social costs range from \u20ac43 to \u20ac4,839 depending on aircraft types. \nIt should be noted that NOx is the only cruise emission included, due to the \nhigher uncertainties of other emissions.  If other pollutants were incorporated, the \ncost would be higher.  Furthermore, the same unit social cost of NOx is applied to \nboth ground level and cruise.  However, it has been argued that the damage in the \nupper atmosphere might be 2-4 times the impact of CO2 alone, as suggested by \n  \n   13\nIPCC (1999), or 10 times higher than at ground level (INFRAS & IWW 1995).  \nTherefore, the values presented in Table 8 could be considered as a conservative \n(lower) estimation. \n \n5.3     Environmental costs \nThe environmental costs here are defined as the aggregation of both noise and \nengine emissions social costs.  From Tables 7 and 8, the environmental costs for \nfive airports are presented in Table 9 and Figure 1.  The annual environmental \nsocial cost is calculated to be \u20ac645 million for Heathrow, followed by Schiphol \n(\u20ac471 million), Gatwick (\u20ac161 million), Stansted (\u20ac82 million) and Maastricht \n(\u20ac11 million).  The results show that the impacts of engine emissions are greater \nthan that of noise, especially at Gatwick and Stansted. From the residents\u2019 \nperspective, noise could be considered as the major issue, with many relatively \nunaware of the magnitude of the emissions impacts. \n(Insert Table 9) \n(Insert Figure 1) \nComparing the environmental cost with the traffic volume of an airport, the \nresults for these five airports indicate that the relationship appears to be \ncurvilinear between annual environmental costs and aircraft movements (Figure \n2).  This implies that the marginal environmental cost is increasing as aircraft \nmovements increase.  In other words, adding a certain amount of traffic to a hub \nairport would cause more environmental damages than that at a regional airport.  \nIt should be noted that this is due to the attraction of a larger hub airport for house \n  \n   14\nand other developments, and thus more social costs. \n(Insert Figure 2) \n \n6. Applications of environmental costs \nBesides showing the degree of the environmental impacts at various airports, \nseveral applications of this result and methodology are presented and discussed in \nthis section.  First of all, the methodology of calculating aircraft noise social costs \ncan be used to determine the proposed European wide noise charge levels.  \nFurthermore, the environmental costs valued in monetary terms can form the input \nof cost-benefit analysis of an airport or an airport system.  \nThis section provides a brief overview of how the results can be applied.  \nHowever, complete analysis of these applications is beyond the scope of this \npaper and requires further research.  All these applications focus on the influence \nof an airport on the region and are to be seen from the perspective of a region.  \n \n6.1 European wide harmonised aircraft noise charges \nOne of the main objectives of the EU common transport policy is to promote the \nsustainable development of transport activities (EC 1999). The use of economic \ninstruments is considered to be an efficient and effective way of improving the \nenvironmental performance of an airport (ICAO 1996, 1998; OECD 1998).  The \nEC\u2019s proposal for potential harmonised noise charges provides the possibility to \nmodulate aircraft noise charges as a function of environmental impact (ANCAT \n  \n   15\n1998; EC 2002).  This formula for calculating noise charges (C ) is as follows \n(EC 2002): \n( ) ( )\n1010 1010\nddaa TL\nd\nTL\na CCC\n\u2212\u2212\n\u22c5+\u22c5=  (5) \nwhere:  \n\u2022 Ca and Cd are the unit noise charges at departures and arrivals for the \nconsidered airport. They reflect the relative importance of noise emissions \nat arrivals and departures for the impacted population.  \n\u2022 La is the certificated noise levels at the approach measurement points, and \nLd is an average of the levels at the flyover and lateral points.   \n\u2022 Ta and Td are noise thresholds at departures and arrival corresponding to \ncategories of relatively quiet aircraft for the considered airport.  \nWhile the certificated noise levels and the noise thresholds are known, no \ncommon and transparent method has been developed for calculating the unit noise \ncharges, namely aC  and dC , at each of the European airports.  The methodology \nof calculating noise social costs can be applied here by deriving the marginal \nnoise impacts of different aircraft categories into a separate departure and arrival \nindex.  \nOur method has taken into account various theoretical and practical aspects.  \nFirstly, the calculation is based on both the certificated noise levels and the \nnumber of residences affected by noise, which is derived from the noise contours \naround airports. This implies that the methodology has fulfilled the condition that \n\u2018noise charges should be proportional to the incremental nuisance for human \nbeings caused by individual aircraft separately at arrival and departure\u2019 (EC \n  \n   16\n2002).  In addition, the same approach could be practically applied to any airport, \neach with their own traffic and operational characteristics.  Finally, for a \npreliminary analysis, the data needed to calculate the unit charges can be easily \nobtained for the majority of the European airports.  \n \n6.2 Cost-benefit analysis of an airport or an airport system \nIn the context of sustainability, an airport can only exist if it generates more social \nand economic benefits to the region or nation than its damages on human beings \nand the environment.  Furthermore, an airport is operating most efficiently when \nits marginal social benefit is equal to its marginal environmental cost.  Any \nmovement beyond this threshold would result in more environmental damage than \nits generated benefit to the society.  The same applies to an airport system.  An \nairport system consists of a few hub and regional airports in a geographically \nclose area\n3\n.  If the hub airport has reached its threshold, any additional flight \nwould be better allocated to other airports.\n4\n \nSo far, the method has not been fully developed for quantifying the economic \nbenefits generated from an airport for the region.  However, the existing research \nindicates that an airport would generate approximately some 1,000 to 1,100 jobs \nper one million passengers (ACI Europe 1998).  This figure, however, does not \ninclude the social benefit of an airport (such as accessibility of the region and \npublic obligation). \n                                                 \n3\n   A good example is the London airport system, with five airports in the greater London area.  \nThose are London-Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted, Luton and City airports. \n4\n   With the maximum net benefit achieved if those flights that rely on point-to-point traffic are \nallocated to the non-hub airports. \n  \n   17\nThe following analysis is done by comparing the economic benefits of an \nairport, resulting from employment for the region, and their environmental costs \nfor both noise and engine emissions.  However, the precise added value of an \nairport should be evaluated by taking into account all possible influences of an \nairport on the local communities and the nation.  Moreover, other factors, such as \nexternal safety and congestion, would also result in environmental costs. \nBased on the estimation of the total economic benefits of the case study \nairports and their environmental costs, Figure 3 shows the marginal economic \nbenefit and marginal environmental cost in relation to aircraft movements by \nusing a regression analysis. This regression analysis has been done on all five \nairports, two of which are main hubs and three are other airports. It can be argued \nthat a main hub airport and a different type of airport have significantly different \ncharacteristics, which makes a general analysis impossible. Due to the size of the \nsample, it is not feasible to split it and perform a separate analysis on the hubs and \non the other airports. Notably, the analysis only serves as an illustration thanks to \nthe limited sample size, and no general conclusions can be drawn from it.  \n(Insert Figure 3) \nThis figure shows that the marginal environmental cost is increasing as aircraft \nmovements increase, while the marginal economic benefit is decreasing.  The \ntentative results appear that the two curves intersect at approximately 450,000 \nmovements per year.  This is the level at which an airport is operating most \nefficiently with its marginal economic benefit equal to the marginal environmental \ncost.  By expanding this analysis to include more airports and factors, policy \n  \n   18\nmakers would be able to determine the equilibrium of an airport system and to \nevaluate any investment or expansion of an airport. \nThe intersection point in Figure 3 would move to the right if new technology \naircraft are introduced that give additional noise and\/or emissions benefits \n(reductions) without increasing real operating costs.  This would shift the \nmarginal cost curve down, without a similar downward movement in the marginal \nbenefit line. \n \n7. Conclusions and recommendations \nWith the European Communities\u2019 policy of strengthening market incentives to \nimprove environmental performance (EC 1999), and the EC\u2019s proposal for a \npotential harmonised noise charges (ANCAT 1998; EC 2002), the assessment of \nthe real social costs of externalities is vital for those policies.  The methodologies \ndeveloped in this research paper for evaluating the social costs of both aircraft \nnoise and engine emissions have been applied for different sized airports, each \nwith their own traffic and operational characteristics. \nOf all five airports, Heathrow Airport has the highest noise and engine \nemissions social cost which is the result of its large number of aircraft movements \nand high population affected by noise.  Having a high volume of aircraft \nmovements and a large surrounding population, Schiphol, however, has lower \nnoise and engine emissions social costs than Heathrow.  Maastricht has higher \nnoise costs than Gatwick and Stansted, but the least engine emissions costs.  The \nenvironmental cost, aggregation of noise and engine emissions costs, is calculated \n  \n   19\nto be \u20ac1,779 per landing for Heathrow, followed by Schiphol (\u20ac1,219), Gatwick \n(\u20ac651), Stansted (\u20ac492) and Maastricht (\u20ac237).  \nThe calculation of environmental costs in monetary terms can be applied in a \nvariety of analyses. The method can be used in determining the proposed \nEuropean unit noise charges.  The environmental costs can serve as an input for \ncost-benefit analysis of an airport and an airport system.   \n \nReferences  \nACI Europe (1998) Creating employment and prosperity in Europe. \nANCAT (1998) Transport aircraft noise classification and noise charges. \nANCAT\/45(Inf.)-WP\/3, the Abatement of Nuisance Caused by Air \nTransport, European Civil Aviation Conference, Brussels. \nArcher LJ (1993) Aircraft emissions and the environment: xCO , xSO , xHO  & \nxNO .
