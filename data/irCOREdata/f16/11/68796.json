INTRODUCTION\nScaling of wires and tighter integration has resulted in signal\nintegrity problems which only add to the interconnection woes;\ncross-talk between signal lines results in signal corruption and\nvariable delay, depending on the respective switching patterns.\nA key technique in reducing propagation delay and signal\ndegradation is repeater insertion. Although very effective and\nsimple, this has an adverse effect on power consumption,\nand it has been estimated that over 50% of the power in a\nhigh performance microprocessor is dissipated by repeaters\ncharging and discharging interconnects [1]. Further, over 90%\nof this power is concentrated in only 10% of the interconnects;\ni.e. those which are classed as global and run for a significant\nfraction of the die length.\nAssistant Driver\nMain Driver\nHa Ha\nHmHm\nFig. 1. Basic schematic of the proposed driver scheme\nIn this paper we propose a repeater that consumes less\nenergy, and is suitable for exactly these kinds of global\ninterconnections. It exploits the fact that in a parallel wire\nstructure, the effective capacitance of a given wire is dynamic;\ni.e. it is a function of not only the physical geometry, but also\nthe relative switching pattern described by the bits on the wire\nin question (the victim) and the adjacent wires (aggressors).\nWith a traditional repeater, since the drive strength is static, the\nresult is a spread of the propagation delay, with the repeater\nstrength being essentially too much for every bit pattern other\nthan the worst-case pattern. In the proposed repeater, the drive\nstrength is dynamically altered depending on the relative bit\npattern, by partitioning it into a Main Driver and Assistant\nDriver. For a higher effective load capacitance both drivers\nswitch, while for a lower effective capacitance the assistant\ndriver is quiet [2]. It is experimentally found that the potential\npeak power saving can be as as much 18% and the jitter\nreduction is about 12% over a traditional repeater for typical\nglobal wire lengths in UMC 0.18\u00b5m technology.\nThe ramifications of the dynamically changing load in\ncoupled interconnects have received a fair amount of attention\nin the literature. A comprehensive analysis of design consid-\nerations for repeater insertion in a bus structure with heavy\ncoupling was presented in [3]. A scheme proposed in [4]\nstaggers the repeaters so that opposing transitions only persist\nfor the length of the offset between repeaters, and become best-\ncase patterns for the remainder, resulting in a delay reduction.\nMany innovative alternatives to the traditional repeater have\nalso been proposed, such as the Transient Sensitive Accelerator\n(TSA) [5], Charge Recycling Technique (CRT) [6], Boosters\n[7], the TAGS receiver [8], the Aggressor-Aware Repeater [9],\nand the Capacitor Coupled Trigger and Accelerator combi-\nnation [10]. Some of these use skewed inverters to trade-off\nnoise margin for speed [5], [7], [8], while others consume\nmore energy [9] and occupy a larger area [5], [7], [8] to\nproduce a faster response.\nIn general, not only do these alternatives to traditional\nrepeaters require much effort in circuit design similar to library\ncell design, but they also lack a clear high-level abstraction;\nin contrast, performance metrics such as delay and energy\nconsumption can easily be quantified in terms of a few critical\ndesign parameters for the traditional inverting repeater [11],\nresulting in easy amalgamation in CAD flows at different\nlevels of hierarchy from initial signal planning to detailed place\n20th International Conference on VLSI Design (VLSID'07)\n0-7695-2762-0\/07 $20.00  \u00a9 2007\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

Schematic of proposed SMART repeater, shown here only for two\ncoupled nets\nand route [12].\nOne of the main advantages of the repeater circuit proposed\nhere is that the relatively minor increase in circuit complexity\nrequired to obtain the energy saving and delay equalization\ndescribed above can be completely abstracted in the perfor-\nmance analysis. We present a design methodology similar to\nthat for traditional single-wire inverting repeaters, including\nan RC equivalent circuit and closed-form expressions for the\nfirst-order approximation to the delay. Therefore this repeater\ncan be very easily modeled in tasks such as delay calculation,\nsignal integrity analysis and timing driven optimisation in any\nCAD flow for physical design.\nThe rest of this document is structured as follows. Section\nII describes the smart repeater circuit and circuit abstraction.\nThe following section presents the design methodology. In the\nnext section we present simulation results that validate the\ndelay analysis. Then, we end with a discussion.\nGroup Case Switching Event on Status of\nwire i wire j the Assistant\n1 1 \u2193 \u2193 Off2 \u2191 \u2191 Off\n2\n3 0 0 Off\n4 0 1 On\n5 1 0 On\n6 1 1 Off\n3\n7 0 \u2191 Off\n8 \u2191 0 Off\n9 0 \u2193 Off\n10 \u2193 0 On\n4\n11 1 \u2191 Off\n12 \u2191 1 On\n13 1 \u2193 Off\n14 \u2193 1 Off\n5 15 \u2191 \u2193 On16 \u2193 \u2191 On\nTABLE I\nSTATUS OF ASSISTANT DRIVER FOR POSSIBLE SWITCHING ACTIVITIES\nON THE LINES.\nII. CONCEPT OF THE SMART DRIVER\nThe variation of effective capacitance with the relative\nswitching pattern introduces a spread in the arrival time at\nthe far end of the wire, which is known as dynamic delay. To\nWorst\u2212Case\nBest\u2212Case with Smart Driver\nT\nBest\u2212Case\nFig. 3. Method of Jitter reduction using SMART driver\ndemonstrate this, a pair of coupled lines is used as a constituent\nunit for a bus. For two simultaneously switching lines, sixteen\npossible switching combinations can be identified (Refer Table\nI). These can be categorized into five different groups accord-\ning to the effective capacitance as follows. Group 1: Both\nswitch in the same direction; Group 2: Both lines are quiet\n(at 0 or 1); Group 3: One line is switching while the other is\nquiet at 0; Group 4: One line is switching while the other is\nquiet at 1; Group 5: The lines switch in opposite directions.\nTo ensure error-free operation, timing constraints have to\nbe satisfied for the switching pattern that causes the worst-\ncase delay, which are the \u2191\u2193 and \u2193\u2191 combinations. Since the\neffective load is highest for these patterns, the size of the buffer\ndesigned statically for the worst-case delay is much larger\nthan would be necessary for the same timing requirements\nfor other patterns [3]. Now this worst-case condition occurs\nonly twice out of 16 possible input switching patterns, with\na probability of 1\/8 for simultaneously switching lines if the\ntransitions are equally distributed as in a random bit stream.\nFor the 14 other cases, the wire is driven faster, which just\ntranslates to slack which typically cannot be used. The driver\nproposed here changes its drive strength depending on the\nneighbour\u2019s switching direction by using some simple logic. A\nbasic schematic of the proposed SMART repeater is shown in\nFigure 2. If the switching pattern belongs to Groups 1, 3, or\n4, a single inverter (the Main driver) drives the interconnect.\nWhen a switching pattern in Group 5 occurs, another inverter\n(the Assistant) also drives the line, increasing the total drive\nstrength appropriately.\nIn Figure 3 the curves with solid lines represent the output\nresponse of a conventional driver, for minimum effective\ncapacitance (Best-Case) and maximum effective capacitance\n(Worst-Case). Our aim, with the SMART driver, is to delay\nthe response for the best-case without affecting the worst-case,\nso that the variation in delay becomes as small as possible. In\nother words, the concept is to make the response slower with\nminimum effective capacitance, as the cycle delay has to be\nset to the worst-case delay anyway.\nA. Circuit Realization\nIt is difficult to change the state of the assistant before the\ninput completes its transition due to the inherent delay in logic\n20th International Conference on VLSI Design (VLSID'07)\n0-7695-2762-0\/07 $20.00  \u00a9 2007\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

Circuit Schematic of the proposed Smart driver\nelements in the smart driver. Hence, in the implementation we\nanticipate and decide whether the next state would be a worst-\ncase pattern or not. For example, assume that wire i is at logic\nlevel zero(0) and wire j is at logic level one(1) at this moment.\nOne of the next states will be wire i going to logic level one(1)\nand wire j switching to logic level zero(0), which is a worst-\ncase pattern described in Group 5. It is the same as with wire\ni in logic level one(1) and wire j being logic level zero(0) at\nthe current state. If the wire i at logic level 0 (1) and wire j\nat logic level 1 (0), the assistant is switched on. For all the\nother states the assistant is off. But due to this anticipation the\nassistant is on for not only the worst-case switching patterns,\ndefined in Group 5, but also for two other patterns as well,\ni.e. case 10 and 12. The decision of making assistant on or off\nshould be taken after the interconnect voltage reaches above\nthreshold voltage and due to this reason the clock cycle has\nto be adjusted such that\nTdriver \u2264 Tlogic < Tclk (1)\nwhere Tdriver is the propagation delay of the driver, Tlogic is\nthe delay of the selection logic circuit, and Tclk is the clock\nperiod. The output of the selection logic should be available\njust after the interconnect is driven, and this is the maximum\nclock rate that can be achieved with this proposed scheme. The\nlower bound of the inequality ensures that assistant driver is\nmaintained until the output has crossed the threshold voltage\n(VDD\/2).\nThe transistor level schematic of the Smart driver is shown\nin the Figure 4. The transistors Pa and Na form the As-\nsistant driver, where as the Inverter I1 works as the Main\nDriver. Two transmission gates, TGp and TGn, are used to\nconnect\/disconnect the path from the signal input and the\ninput of assistant driver. The transistors Pk and Nk will ensure\nthat the assistant driver is off while the signal input path to\nthe assistant is cut off, Otherwise the assistant driver will be\njust floating. The selection logic signals Psel and Nsel are\ndetermined as:\nPsel = Agg + V ictim\nNsel = Agg.V ictim\nAt point A\nAt point B\nAggressor\nVictim\nFig. 5. When the both drivers are active: Aggressor and the Victim switches\nin different directions\nAt point A\nAt point B\nAggressor,Victim\nFig. 6. Only when the main driver is active: Aggressor and the Victim\nswitches in the same direction\nWhen the victim input is at logic 0 and the aggressor is at\nlogic 1, the next victim stage would be logic 1, and this might\nbe a worst-case pattern if the aggressor too change its state.\nIn this case we switched on Na and switched off Pa since Pa\nis not needed during this discharging time. This is achieved\nby setting Nasel = 0 and Pasel = 0.\nTransmission gates is used as the switch to on\/off the path\nbetween the wire input to the assistant driver, in order to reduce\nthe path resistance. Cascaded two stage buffer is utilized to\ndrive the transmission gate. Not only that the cascaded buffer\ndelays the output of the selection logic so that it satisfy the\ncondition mentioned in the Equation (1). If odd number of\nstages are needed in the cascaded buffer, selection logic has\nto be changed accordingly.\nFigures 5 and 6 shows the simulations results at the far\nend and near end - points A and B in Figure 9 - of an\n2.5mm long wire driven by a smart repeater and a traditional\nrepeater (inverter). When both the inputs, Aggressor and\nVictim, switches in the same direction the smart driver shows a\ndelayed response, but the traditional driver shows a very faster\nresponse. But the far-end waveform the traditional repeater\ntakes very a longer time to settle, but that for the smart driver\nis faster. When the victim and Aggressor switches in different\ndirections, in this case victim switches upward and aggressor\nswitches downward, both drivers show similar response, i.e.\nsmart driver has similar drive capability.\n20th International Conference on VLSI Design (VLSID'07)\n0-7695-2762-0\/07 $20.00  \u00a9 2007\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

First-Order Delay Model\nThe delay analysis for repeater insertion is carried out by\ncharacterizing a minimum sized inverter by an output resis-\ntance Rdmin, in addition to the input gate capacitance Cgmin\nand output drain-diffusion capacitance Cdmin already defined.\nFollowing notation is used as the wire electrical parameters:\nRw - total wire resistance, Cs - total self wire (wire-to-ground)\ncapacitance and Cc - total interwire capacitance.\n1) Delay Analysis with both Drivers Switching: With the\nlinearisation of the driver, the equivalent circuit for one re-\npeater segment can be shown to be the circuit in Figure 7.\nHence the 50% delay for the wire can be expressed as\nRdmin\nHm+Ha Rw\nCs\n\u03bbCc\n(Ha +Hm)Cdmin (Ha +Hm)Cgmin\nFig. 7. Equivalent Circuit for the case when both drivers are switching\nTMA = 0.7k(tDout + tDin) +\n0.7(tDWs + \u00b5itDWc)\n(Hm +Ha)\n+ 0.7tWD(Hm +Ha) + 0.4\ntWs\nk\n+\n\u03bbitWc\nk\n(2)\nwhere i = 3. Here Hm and Ha are the sizes of the Main and\nAssistant drivers respectively, \u03bb, \u00b5 are the empherical switch\nfactors1 proposed in [3], and to simplify the delay equation,\nthe following time constants have been defined: tDout =\nRdminCdmin, tDWs = RdminCs, tDWc = RdminCc, tDin =\nRdminCgmin, tWD = RwCgmin, tWs = RwCs and tWc =\nRwCc.\n2) Delay Analysis with the Assistant Quiet: When the\nAssistant driver is quiet while the Main driver is switching,\nthe gate capacitance of the Assistant will not add to the\nload, as it is disconnected by a switch in which the input\ncapacitance is negligible compared to the Assistant driver\u2019s\ninput capacitance (see Figure 8). However the parasitic drain-\ndiffusion capacitance will always add to the load.\nRdmin\nHm\n(Hm +Ha)Cdmin\n\u03bbCc\nHmCgmin\nRw\nCs\nFig. 8. Equivalent Circuit for the case when the Main driver is switching\n1When one wire is switching and the other: switching in the same directions\n\u03bb0 = \u00b50 = 0, is quiet either at zero or one \u03bb1 = 0.57 and \u00b50 = 0.67,\nswitching opposite direction \u03bb2 = 1.51 and \u00b52 = 2.2.\nThe delay expression is now, with the time constants defined\nearlier:\nTM = 0.7k\n[\ntDout\n(\n1 +\nHa\nHm\n)\n+ tDin\n]\n+ 0.7HmtWD\n+\n0.7(tDWs + \u00b5itDWc)\nHm\n+ 0.4\ntWs\nk\n+\n\u03bbitWc\nk\n(3)\nwhere i = 1, 2\nEquations (2) and (3) are the two principal delay equations\nof the SMART driver for its two states of Main and Assis-\ntant drivers switching, and Main driver switching while the\nAssistant driver is quiet.\nB. Sizing of the Drivers\nWe obtain the optimal Hm, Ha and k values by deriving\nan expression for (Hm +Ha) and k by minimising tMA.\nHt = Hm opt +Ha opt =\n\u221a\ntDWs + \u00b5itDWc\ntWD\n(4)\nk opt =\n\u221a\n0.4tWs + \u03bbitWc)\n0.7(tDout + tDin)\n(5)\nSince the Assistant driver switches only for the worst-case\nswitching pattern defined by Group 5 in Table I, the size of\nthe Assistant driver, Ha, can be used to tune the delays for\nthe other switching combinations defined by Groups 1 and 3-\n4. The expressions in (3) and (2) represent the delay for all\nthese switching combinations. For clarity of explanation, say\nT1, T2 and T3 are the wire delays for Groups 1, 3-4, and 5\nrespectively. Hence T1 = TM |\u03bb=0, T2 = TM |\u03bb=1 and T3 =\nTMA. Now increasing Ha increases TM (see Figure ??), and\nhence Ha can be sized so that either T1 = T3 or T2 = T3\n(T1 = T2 = T3 is not possible because the relative delay\nvariation between T1 and T2 is not a function of Ha).\nThe delay variation can be quantified as\n\u2206T = TMA \u2212 TM .\nBy setting \u2206T = 0, delay balancing can be achieved. Substi-\ntuting for TMA and TM from (3) and (2) and using the relation\nHmDB = Ht \u2212HaDB the following quadratic for HaDB can\nbe obtained.\nAH2aDB +BHaDB + C = 0 (6)\nwhere\nA = 0.7tWD\nB = 0.7 [ktDout \u2212 tWDHt\n+\ntDWs + 2tDWc\nHt\n]\n+\n(\u03bb2 \u2212 \u03bb1)tWc\nk\nC = 0.7(\u03bb3 \u2212 \u03bb2)tDWc +\n0.4(\u00b53 \u2212 \u00b52)tWC\nk\nNow sizing HaDB to equalise T1 and T3 results in T2 being\nlarger than T3, which may not always be possible due to\nconstraints on T3, the worst-case delay. However equalising\nT2 and T3 does not result in any such adverse effect.

For this repeater configuration\nthe delays 2 for different switching patterns are shown in the\nFigure 10. The 50% delay is measured from the input to the\nfar-end of the last section (Point O in Figure 9). It clearly\ndepicts the idea of delay balancing, reducing the drive strength\nfor low effective capacitance and increasing drive capability\nfor higher effective capacitance. The variation of maximum\nand minimum delays with Ha is shown in Figure 11 and found\nthat Ha should be in the range of 70-75 in order to have a\nminimum delay variation. In the case of the traditional driver\nthe delay variation is 212ps, but for the smart driver case it\nis 187ps. With the help of the smart repeater technique the\ndelay variation is reduced by about 12% and the peak power\nconsumption is reduced by more or less 18% (Peak power\ndissipation for the traditional case is 16mW and that of smart\ndriver is 13.1mW ).\nWhen Ha is very small 10-20% of Ht the delay variation is\nvery much close that of a traditional driver, but as it increases,\nwhich in turn reduces the size of Hm, the delay variation is\nincreased drastically (Figure 11).\nUP,UP UP,QUIET UP,DOWN\n450\n500\n550\n600\n650\n700\n750\nSwitching Pattern\nD\nel\nay\n in\n p\ns\n \n \nCalculated\nSimulated\nSmart Repeater\nTraditional Repeater\nFig. 10.

A jitter reduction method called delay balancing\ntechnique is also presented. However, compared to a bus\nwire structure, the area for the extra gates are considerably\nsmall. With the same maximum delay as with traditional\nrepeaters, SMART repeaters presented in this work shows\n12% jitter reduction and a 18% peak power consumption. We\nconclude that SMART repeaters consumes less peak energy\nand reduce the data dependent jitter, with a area penalty but\nnot a delay penalty. In future technologies since the transistors\nare less expensive than routing area, this would probably be\nan excellent replacement.\nREFERENCES\n[1] N. Magen, A. Kolodny, U. Weiser, and N.
