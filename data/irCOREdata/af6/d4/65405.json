Although studies have shown links between \nmasculinity and possible indicators of health such as fluctuating asymmetry, \npreferences for facial masculinity do not co-vary with preferences for apparent health \n(Boothroyd et al., 2005).  Here we build on that work with two studies.  Study 1 \naddresses the concern that apparent health may not fully reflect long term immune \nfunction by investigating how masculinity preferences correlate with preferences for \nother potential indicators of \u2018good genes\u2019: symmetry and averageness.  Study 2 \ninvestigated whether masculinity preferences were dependant upon the presence of \nother indicators of \u2018good immunity\u2019 in the face, by showing observers both symmetric \nand asymmetric masculinity stimuli.   Across three samples, women\u2019s masculinity \npreferences were inversely correlated with symmetry preferences, counter to \nprediction, and there were no consistent associations with apparent health or \naverageness.  Results of Study 2 suggested that masculinity preferences may be \nenhanced in symmetric stimuli; however, these results appear to have been driven by \na single stimulus, suggesting that more research is needed into the potential \nimportance of initial stimulus properties when investigating masculinity preferences. \n \nIntroduction \n \nThere is an extensive literature documenting systematic variation in female \npreferences for sexual dimorphism\/masculinity in male faces.  Women seem to show \nthe strongest preference for masculinity at times when they are most likely to \nconceive (e.g. Penton-Voak et al., 1999; Penton-Voak & Perrett, 2000; Johnston et al., \n2001; Jones et al., 2005; Little et al., 2007) when explicitly asked to judge for a \npotential short term (i.e. sexual, not a longstanding relationship) partner and when \nthey already have a committed long term partner (Little et al., 2002).  In sum, women \nseem most attracted (or possibly least averse) to male facial masculinity in contexts \nwhere we may suppose they are seeking a sexual partner, and when the genetic \nmaterial of that partner is paramount. \n \nThese patterns of results are commonly explained with reference to the \nImmuncompetence Hypothesis (Folstad & Karter, 1992) which proposes that \nandrogen-related exaggerated characteristics demonstrate the strength of a male\u2019s \nimmune system in the face of the immunosuppressive effects of androgens.  Thus by \nchoosing highly masculine sexual partners, females may be maximising the viability \nof their offspring via heritable immune function.  Evidence put forward to support this \nview includes the finding that more masculine faces can appear more healthy (e.g. \nJohnston  et al., 2001; though, cf Boothroyd et al., 2005) and that more masculine \nmen tend to be more symmetrical, and suffer lower levels of upper respiratory illness \n(Gangestad & Thornhill, 2003; Thornhill & Gangestad, 2006; Little, Jones, Burt, & \nPerrett, 2008a). \n \nIn contrast to these interpretations of evidence, however, Boothroyd et al. (2005) \nproposed that if women are indeed choosing facial masculinity on the basis of its links \nto immune function, then preferences for facial masculinity should correlate with \npreferences for other indicators of immune function such as apparent health (which \nrelates to MHC heterozygosity: Roberts et al., 2005).  Across four samples of women, \nBoothroyd et al did not find any such correlation, which they argued failed to support \nan immunocompetence explanation.  It is possible, however, that apparent facial \nhealth was an inappropriate choice of comparison variable.  For instance, while \npreferences for masculinity seem to be driven, at least partly, by female testosterone \nlevels (Welling et al., 2007) and linked with short-term mating, preferences for \napparent health seem to be linked with progesterone levels and may represent the need \nto avoid contagious individuals during pregnancy (Jones et al., 2005).  Thus, apparent \nhealth may primarily be utilised as an indicator of current pathogen load, not broader \nimmunocompetence.  The first aim of this research, therefore, was to replicate \nBoothroyd et al's study using alternative facial indicators of long-term immune \nfunction; this shall be the focus of Study 1. \n \nAnother possible flaw in the work of Boothroyd et al. (2005), is the treatment of \nattraction to masculinity and attraction to healthiness as independent dimensions of \npreference.  It may be argued that although masculinisation can be viewed as an \nindicator of a strong immune system (as it signals having withstood \nimmunosuppression by testosterone), it may be that this is only true when combined \nwith other indicators of good immunity.  That is to say, masculinity may only be \nattractive (on the basis of immunocompetence) when it occurs alongside evidence that \nthe testosterone required to produce the masculine appearance has indeed been \nsuccessfully withstood.  This possibility will be the focus of Study 2. \n \n \nStudy 1 \n \nAs discussed above, it is possible that the primary function of apparent health within \nmate choice, is to guide individuals away from unhealthy partners who carry a risk of \ncontagion.  There are, however, other features of facial appearance which have been \nsuggested to be indicators of, or associated with, long term health (i.e. general \nresistance to pathogens) and genetic quality. \n \nFluctuating asymmetry has long been considered to be an indicator of the degree to \nwhich an individual has withstood environmental assaults, including pathogens, \nduring development.  More symmetric individuals report less respiratory illness \n(Thornhill & Gangestad, 2006), and those with more symmetric faces have healthier-\nlooking skin (Jones et al., 2004).  Thus, although symmetry may indicate resistance to \na wide variety of environmental damage, it appears it may in part demonstrate good \nimmunity.  Similarly, facial averageness (the extent to which ones facial proportions \nresemble the population means) has been suggested as an indicator of 'good genes'.  \nObserver ratings of facial \u2018distinctiveness\u2019 (the opposite of averageness) have been \nassociated with poorer health (Rhodes et al., 2001a), suggesting that averageness may \nindicate immune function. Furthermore, more average faces are considered attractive \n(e.g. Langlois, Roggman & Musselman, 1994; Rhodes et al., 2001b; Little & \nHancock, 2002). \n \nNew evidence has suggested that symmetry preferences may indeed correlate with \nmasculinity preferences (Little, Jones, DeBruine & Feinberg, 2008b), which the \nauthors interpreted as showing that both indicated mate quality.  In the current study, \nby also examining averageness and health preferences, alongside masculinity and \nsymmetry, we hope to more clearly establish whether women\u2019s preferences for male \nmasculinity represent preferences for heritable immunity. \n \nStudy 1 utilised two populations: one recruited online (which represents a wider range \nof participants, and more generalisable sample), and the other recruited from \nundergraduates (who were tested under more controlled conditions). \n \nStimuli: Set A \n \n48 Caucasian Durham University students (24 male; mean age = 19.7 years) were \nphotographed in portrait view under standardised conditions.  Four composite \u2018base\u2019 \nfaces images were formed from six randomly selected male faces using the image \nprocessing package Psychomorph (Rowland & Perrett, 1995; Tiddeman et al., 2001).  \nComposites were created by calculating average 2D coordinates of 179 facial \nlandmarks and average RGB colouration at each pixel.  These base face images were \nthen \u2018transformed\u2019 by being manipulated along four multi-dimensional continua \nrepresented by exemplar facial images: \n \n- Sexual dimorphism: 50% of the difference between the average of all male faces and \nthe average of all female faces was applied to the faces, creating masculinised and \nfeminised versions of image. \n- Averageness: 50% of the difference between themselves and the average of all male \nfaces was applied to the base faces, creating versions of each face which were closer \nto, or further from, the population mean dimensions.  \n- Symmetry: base faces were warped into the shape of a real face, chosen at random \nfrom within that base group, in order to create real fluctuating asymmetry (since FA is \nlost in averages).  Faces were then warped into perfect symmetry, to create one half of \neach pair.  Finally the difference between the \u2018individual\u2019 faces and the symmetric \nversions was used to create images representing136% of real asymmetry, as the \nsecond half of each image pair. \n- Apparent health: the two exemplars used were a composite of faces rated by \nobservers as most healthy-looking and a composite of faces rated as least healthy-\nlooking from a St Andrews student cohort (as previously used by Boothroyd et al., \n2005).  50% of the difference between these composites was applied to the base faces, \ncreating a health-looking and unhealthy-looking version of each. \n  \nThere were thus 16 pairs of face images in total.  For masculinity, averageness and \nsymmetry, colour and texture were held constant while only 2-D shape was changed.  \nFor apparent health, colour and texture were also changed.  Sample male image pairs \ncan be seen in Figure 1. \n \nProcedure \n \nSample 1a. 184 heterosexual women aged 16-35 (mean=25.4, s.d.=4.7 years) were \nrecruited through the laboratory website and rated their preferences for all stimuli \npairs on an eight-point scale from strongly prefer one face (0=strong preference for \nfeminine, asymmetric, distinctive, unhealthy) to strongly prefer the other face \n(7=strong preference for masculine, symmetric, average, healthy).  Because of a \nprogramming error, only 67 women rated the symmetry stimuli.  Order of pairs and \nleft-right alignment was randomised. \n \nSample 1b. 102 heterosexual undergraduate females aged 18-26 (mean=20.1, s.d.=1.2 \nyears) were recruited by word of mouth and completed the same test as Sample 1a on \nuniversity computers. \n \nResults \n \nSample 1a Preliminary analyses comparing the pattern of preference scores against \nthat expected by chance showed that participants preferred significantly femininised, \naverage and healthy versions of the faces (all t>2.0, all p<0.05, see Table 1 for details) \nbut no significant preference was found for the symmetry stimuli (t183=0.529). \n  \nCorrelation analyses showed a significant negative association between women\u2019s \npreferences for masculinity and their preference for symmetry (rs=-0.320, n=67, \np<0.01) and also a significant positive correlation between their preference for \nsymmetry and for averageness (rs=0.377, n=67, p<0.01); i.e. women who preferred \nhigher levels of symmetry in male faces preferred lower levels of facial masculinity \nand higher levels of averageness.  There were no other significant correlations \nbetween women\u2019s preferences (see Table 2 for statistics).   \n  \nSample 1b There were significant preferences for averageness and health in male \nfaces (both t>8.5, p<0.001) but no significant preference for either face when rating \nthe masculinity and symmetry pairs (both t<0.1, p>0.1; see Table 1 for details). \n  \nThere was a significant negative association between women\u2019s masculinity \npreferences and their preferences for averageness (rs=-0.208, n=102, p<0.05) and a \ntrend for a negative relationship between their masculinity and symmetry preferences \n(rs=-0.179, n=102, p=0.07), such that the more participants preferred male facial \nmasculinity, the less they preferred averageness and symmetry.  There were no other \nsignificant correlations (see Table 2 for details). \n \nDiscussion \n \nThe aim of Study 1 was to replicate and extend the first study of Boothroyd et al. \n(2005), to address whether preferences for male facial masculinity correlated with \nother, perhaps more robust, indicators of good immunity.  Not only were previous \nresults, regarding a lack of correlation between masculinity and apparent health \npreferences, replicated for a fifth and sixth time, using a third set of stimuli, but there \nwas furthermore evidence that women\u2019s male facial masculinity preferences may be \nnegatively correlated with other long term health indicators, such as symmetry and \naverageness. \n \nThis negative correlation is particularly surprising \u2013 far more so than any lack of \ncorrelation, given that there is evidence for symmetry preferences showing some \nsimilar patterns to masculinity preferences (for instance, greater preferences for \nsymmetry at ovulation: Little et al., 2007, and amongst high mate value women: \nPenton-Voak et al., 2003), which is not the case with apparent health preferences, and \nfurthermore that Little et al. (2008b) found a positive correlation between symmetry \nand masculinity preferences when women viewed male faces.  There are two key \ndifferences between the current study and Little et al. (2008b).  First, the stimuli here \nwere all drawn from the same population of faces, and were all cropped and masked \nin an identical fashion, while Little et al. utilised separate sets of stimuli, and used \nunmasked symmetry stimuli; thus masking the symmetry stimuli could have changed \nthe results and may moreover be the reason for the lack of symmetry preference in \nSample 1b.  The second difference is that while Little et al.\u2019s participants preferred \nmasculinity in male faces overall, the current samples preferred femininity or had no \npreference.  As such the results presented here remain consistent with Little et al.\u2019s in \nthat Sample 1a showed a preference for symmetry which correlated with their \npreferred direction of male dimorphism: femininity.  Studies investigating the overall \npreference for sexual dimorphism have previously found mixed results with some \nstudies finding a preference for more feminine faces (e.g. Perrett et al., 1998; Penton-\nVoak et al., 1999) while others find a preference for more masculine faces (e.g. \nJohnston et al., 2001; DeBruine et al., 2006). Such differences between studies may \neither be because of random sample variation in participant circumstances or variation \nin the stimuli. Either way the effect is that either more masculine or more feminine \nfaces are more preferred generally.  These results thus show that symmetry \npreferences correlate with other directional preferences, and are therefore likely to be \na sexually selected trait, but they do not support a specifically immunocompetence \ninterpretation of Little et al.\u2019s results. \n \nIn this sample, we have attempted to maintain maximal variation between women in \nvarious factors of mating strategy, in order to increase the likelihood of detecting co-\nvariation.  Consequently, we have not controlled for known systematic variation such \nas menstrual cycle phase and cannot investigate whether such effects exist in this \nsample.  It may be, therefore, that other (as yet unidentified) individual differences in \npreferences are masking adaptive co-variation.  However, this would still beg the \nquestion of how masculinity preferences are varying beyond any potential variance \nascribable to immunity preferences, if such immunity-based variance is so very \nadaptive.  As such, these results continue to undermine an immunocompetence \nunderstanding of facial masculinity preferences. \n \nFinally it should be noted that there are some differences between the two samples\u2019 \nresults, such that averageness preferences are related to symmetry preferences in \nSample 1a, and masculinity preferences in Sample 1b.  These differences may \nrepresent systematic differences between online and laboratory samples, such as \nsocioeconomic profile or motivational state (although previous studies have found \nconsistent results in related studies: e.g. Boothroyd et al, 2005; Jones et al, 2005), or \nmay alternatively reflect random variation in the sampling.  As it is not possible to \ndetermine which without further data collection, these particular results should be \nviewed cautiously and are not considered below. \n \n \nStudy 2 \n \nAs discussed in the introduction, it may be erroneous to view facial masculinity as a \nsingle linear variable.  Rather, when women viewed masculinity, they may consider it \nin conjunction with other facial traits.  An immunocompetence view of masculinity \nwould predict that Masculinity as a signal of immunocompetance would be \nundermined (or negated) by coincident signals of poor long term health.  Masculinity \nwould be expect to be more attractive when features of poor health (i.e. evidence that \ntestosterone has unduly damaged immune function) are absent. \n \nTherefore, in this study, we consider the potential interactions between facial \nmasculinity and facial symmetry in attractiveness.  Although apparent facial health \ndoes indeed relate to genetic influences on immune function, it may (as discussed \nabove) primarily serve to indicate current health.  In contrast, facial masculinity may \nrelate to current testosterone only intermittently (Pound et al., 2008), and is perhaps \nmore likely to reflect pubertal testosterone in particular (e.g. Verdonck et al., 1999).  \nTherefore a putative signal of long-term immune function, which may indicate \nresistance to immunosuppression during puberty, should be more important than a \nfeature which seems to primarily reflect current pathogen load. \n \nFor this reason, symmetry was selected as the variable to be manipulated alongside \nmasculinity.  If masculinity is indeed an immunocompetence indicator, we would \npredict that women\u2019s preferences for male facial masculinity should be stronger when \nviewing symmetric faces than asymmetric faces.  If, however, women's preferences \nfor masculinity are primarily driven by behavioural considerations unrelated to health \ncues, we would not expect any differences in the strength of masculinity preferences \nbetween symmetric and asymmetric stimuli. \n \nStudy 2 again used two samples, the first collected from an undergraduate class \n(Sample 2a) and the latter from online recruitment through the experimenter\u2019s website \n(Sample 2b). \n \nStimuli \n \nSet B: The symmetry stimuli from Set A were further manipulated in terms of sexual \ndimorphism, using an identical procedure to that used for the masculinity stimuli in \nStudy 1.  This produced 4 pairs of asymmetric masculinity stimuli, and 4 pairs of \nsymmetric masculinity stimuli.  Sample pairs are shown in Figure 2.  \n \nSet C: A further 55 Durham University undergraduates and postgraduates (28 female; \nmean age 21.1 years) were photographed under standardised conditions, and average \nmale and female faces were produced using Psychomorph.  The average male was \nthen each warped into the shape of 5 different, randomly selected, individual male \nfaces (thus the resulting images had the individual\u2019s shape, but the average male\u2019s \ncolour and texture), and the images produced were then warped to produce perfectly \nsymmetrical and 127% asymmetrical face images using an identical procedure to \nStudy 1 (although a slightly lower degree of asymmetry was used to prevent unsightly \nartefacts in some images).  These symmetric and asymmetric versions of each face \nwere then manipulated in terms of sexual dimorphism, as above, using the average \nmale and female from this stimulus set. \n \nProcedure \n \nSample 2a: 115 female undergraduates aged 18-22 completed the study as part of a \npractical class.  Most students participated using university computers, although a \nminority used their home PCs.  Participants were presented with the Set B stimuli in \nmasculinised-feminised pairs, and asked to indicate which they found most attractive \nand the extent of their preference using an identical procedure to Study 1 \n \nSample 2b: 1122 heterosexual women aged 16-29 (mean age =23.4, s.d.=3.5) were \nrecruited via the laboratory website.  Following a questionnaire in which they gave \ntheir demographic information, they rated their preferences for the masculinised \nversus the feminised versions of each face for both Set B and Set C stimuli, in an \nidentical manner to Sample 2a.  They also rated their preferences for the symmetric \nversus the asymmetric versions of each face.  Pairs of faces which varied in \nmasculinity and in symmetry were shown in the same block of trials; the order of \ntrials and left right position of face images was randomised throughout.     \n \nResults \n   \nSample 2a.  Participants showed no overall preference for the masculinised or \nfeminised male faces (t114=1.547, mean=0.18, SE=0.12).  There was a significant \ndifference between symmetric and asymmetric stimuli such that women preferred \nhigher levels of masculinity in symmetrical male faces than asymmetric male faces \n(t114=2.385, p<0.05, d=0.45).  However, when  preferences for each face pair were \nexamined separately, the significant effect seemed to be driven solely by the stimuli \ncreated from one base face, labelled \u2018Face 2\u2019 (t114=2. 405, p<0.05, d=0.45).  There \nwere no other significant differences (see Table 3).  Furthermore, when the results \nwere analysed using the faces as the unit of analysis, mean masculinity preferences \nwere not significantly stronger for either the symmetric or asymmetric versions of \neach face (t3=1.382). \n \nSample 2b. Participants showed overall significant preferences for the feminised faces \nover the masculinised faces (t1121=16.771, p<0.001, mean=-0.39, SE=0.02), and for \nthe symmetric faces over the asymmetric faces (t1121=19.696, p<0.001, mean=0.33, \nSE=0.02).  Furthermore, as in Study 1, masculinity preferences were negatively \ncorrelated with overall symmetry preferences, regardless of the level of symmetry of \nthe masculinised face pairs (symmetric: r1121=-0.173, p<0.001; asymmetric: r1121=-\n0.219, p<0.001). \n  \nParticipants showed significantly stronger masculinity preferences when viewing \nsymmetric male stimuli than asymmetric male stimuli (t1121=3.442, p<0.001, d=0.21).  \nHowever, the significant effect was again driven by Face 2 (t1121=4.116, p<0.001, \nd=0.25) with no other significant differences in women\u2019s preferences for the \nindividual faces, although there were trends for two other face images, labelled Face 1 \nand Face 4 (t1121=1.781, p=0.082 and t1121=1.695, p=0.090 respectively; for all results \nsee Table 2).   \n  \nWhen the results were analysed by face, there was a trend for the masculinised \nversion of each face to be more preferred when the symmetrical versions of the face \nstimuli were shown, rather than the asymmetrical versions (t8=2.063, p=0.07, d=1.46); \nhowever, this became non-significant when Face 2 and Face 1 were removed \n(t6=1.626). \n  \nFurthermore, when the female participants\u2019 symmetry preferences were broken down \nand examined at the level of individual faces, women significantly preferred the \nsymmetric version of each of the face stimuli whether masculinised or feminised (all \nt>3.8, all p<0.001) with the exception of the masculinised Face 2 pair and the \nfeminised version of Face 1, where no preference was shown (t1121=0.688 and \nt1121=1.060 respectively).  It therefore appears that Face 2, and to a lesser extent Face \n1, represent an anomaly in comparison with the rest of the stimuli. \n \nDiscussion \n \nThe purpose of Study 2 was to investigate whether women showed a stronger \npreference for masculinity in male faces in the presence of other visible cues to good \nlong term health.  However, when the data were considered on a stimulus-by-stimulus \nbasis, we could not preclude there being no such effect.  Furthermore, examining the \nconfidence intervals of the mean differences (Table 2) shows that although Sample 2a \nmay have a significant \u2018true\u2019 mean (the upper bounds of the CIs all reach the mean for \nFace 2), this is not likely to be the case for Sample 2b (where the upper bounds of the \nCIs generally do not begin to approach that magnitude; see Aberson, 2002, for a \ndiscussion of the reporting of null effects).  While the experimental hypothesis of this \nstudy was not a critical test of the immunocompetence approach to male masculinity, \na significant result may have served to explain the null effects seen in Study 1 and by \nBoothroyd et al. (2005).  As it is, the null results in Study 2 currently allow the \ncritiques of the Immunocompetence Hypothesis made on the basis of the correlational \nstudies to stand. \n \nIt is worth noting, however, that the case of stimulus Face 2, which showed a \nsignificant effect across both samples, suggests that there may be other prerequisites \nrequired to affect women\u2019s masculinity preferences.  Post-hoc rankings of all original \nstimulus faces (see Figure 3) by 17 observers (8 female; mean age=28.5 years, \nSD=3.3) showed that Face 2 was ranked as significantly the most attractive base face \n(F8,128=42.879, p<0.001; post-hoc test with next nearest face: p<0.05), though it was \nneither the most nor the least masculine (see Table 3 for mean ranks for all faces).  \nFurther research can seek to determine whether initial stimulus attractiveness interacts \nwith experimental manipulations such as masculinisation, ot whether the current \nresults simply represent an anomalous outlier image.   \n \n \n \nGeneral Discussion \n \nIn order to further investigate the role of male sexual dimorphism in facial \nattractiveness judgements two studies were performed. The major finding from the \nfirst study, replicated in the second, was a negative relationship between the level of \nmasculinity preferred by participants and their preference for other possible indicators \nof health. Such a finding suggests that masculinity is not simply interpreted as an \nindicator of heath, as might be expected from the Immunocompetence Hypothesis. \nSince this finding was unexpected given much of the current literature, a second study \nwas performed to ascertain whether facial masculinity might be preferred to a greater \nextent in the presence of other facial cues suggesting health (ie. symmetrical as \nopposed to asymmetrical faces). Overall, women were found to prefer greater levels \nof masculinisation in the more symmetrical male faces than in the less symmetrical \nmale faces but on closer observation of the data, this effect was found to be driven by \na single face stimulus. \n \nAs previously noted, the negative correlation found here between level of masculinity \npreferred and the level of other cues to health preferred by participants is especially \npuzzling given a recent study by Little et al. (2008) in which a positive correlation \nwas found between level of masculinity preferred and level of symmetry preferred. \nSuch a difference between the two studies is especially surprising given the \nsimilarities in the methods employed. One notable difference between the two studies \nis the finding of an overall preference for slightly feminine male faces here and a \nslightly masculine male face by Little et al. As noted by Little et al. and DeBruine et \nal. (2006), previous studies of the level of male facial masculinity preferred by female \nparticipants have found varying results with many finding female participants \npreferring slightly feminine faces and others finding preference for slightly masculine \nfaces or no preference. A possible explanation of the varying findings is that the male \nand female face images used in the different experiments vary in relative \nattractiveness. For instance, if one group happens to use male faces which are \n(relatively) more attractive than the female faces in their transform then a slightly \nmasculine face might be more likely to be found attractive in comparison to an \nexperiment in which the male to female transform is derived from faces in which the \nfemale face images are slightly more attractive. In such circumstances, an individual \nwho was more choosy would be expected to select the more masculine face as more \nattractive (when generally more masculine faces are preferred) or the more feminine \nmale face (when generally more feminine than average faces are preferred). Such a \nscenario explains our results and that of previous experiments including Little et al. \nbut suggests that in comparison to other subtle factors which mediate the variation \nbetween experiments, any effect of masculinity as a cue to health is dwarfed. \nFurthermore, it would suggest that both the negative correlation found between \nsymmetry preference and masculinity found here, and the positive correlation found \nby Little et al. are both the result of some individuals being generally more choosy \nthan others rather than showing any preference for masculinity per se. Thus, the \ncurrent studies seem to show a lack of support for the Immunocompetence \nHypothesis.   \n \nAlternatively, one might argue that male masculinity is a \u2018unique case\u2019.  While \nalternative potential indicators of immune function such as apparent health are viewed \nby observers as being associated with a raft of positive character attributes \n(Boothroyd, Jones, Burt & Perrett, 2007), masculinity is generally viewed as being \nassociated with undesirable characteristics for a long term partner (Perrett et al., 1998; \nJohnston et al., 2001; Boothroyd et al., 2007) and is associated with greater self-\nreported mating effort by males (Boothroyd, Jones, Burt, DeBruine & Perrett, 2008).  \nTherefore, we might suggest that women\u2019s masculinity preferences are highly \nconstrained (i.e. they may only select for masculinity where long term investment is \nnot important) in a manner which preferences for other immunocompetence indicators \nare not.  The counter to this argument is that higher male symmetry has been shown to \nbe associated with higher mating effort (Simpson, Gangestad, Christensen, & Leck, \n1999), higher physical aggression (Furlow, Gangestad, & Armijo-Prewitt, 1998) and \nlower cooperativeness (Zaatari & Trivers, 2007), in a similar manner to masculinity \nand\/or testosterone, and thus women\u2019s preferences for symmetry should show similar \nconstraint.  However, it should be noted that research into perceptions of \npersonality\/behaviour and facial symmetry have thus far found inconsistent results \n(Fink et al., 2006; Noor & Evans, 2003; Shackleford & Larsen, 1997), which is not \nthe case with attributions to masculinity.  Thus women\u2019s perceptions may not reliably \nlink symmetry with any undesirable traits, and thus not act to constrain their \npreferences. \n \nOverall, therefore, the current studies are unable to support the Immunocompetence \nHypothesis, when investigating women\u2019s masculinity preferences, rather than men\u2019s \nmasculinity.  Arguably, investigating women\u2019s masculinity preferences as they \noperate, rather than investigating the correlates of masculinisation in men (which may \nnot necessarily form the basis for women\u2019s choices), gives us the clearest evidence on \nwhy women make the choices they do.  If this is the case, then the \nImmunocompetence Hypothesis should be treated cautiously (although we need not \nby any means abandon the notion of \u2018good genes\u2019; rather we might focus on \nalternative indirect benefits; see e.g. Boothroyd et al., 2007).  However, as discussed \nabove, there may be alternative reasons for the lack of support seen here, and further \nresearch is needed to investigate initial stimulus properties and to what extent \nperceptions of personality traits may act to constrain preferences. \n \nAcknowledgements \nWith thanks to Nicola Jones, Farrah Nazir and Josh Moore for assistance with image \nprocessing, and Elizabeth Kelly and Rebecca Winter for assistance in recruiting \nSample 1b.
