Coke of Norfolk 1754-1842. A biography. \nWoodbridge, Suffolk: The Boydell Press. xii + 218 pp. \u00a350.00. \nISBN 978-1-84383-426-7 \n \nThe life of Thomas Coke spanned events which were pivotal in British history \u2013 the \nAmerican and French Revolutions and the Napoleonic Wars, the Reform Act of 1832 \nand the accession of Victoria in 1837. This period also saw the flowering of \nagricultural enlightenment, the appreciation of the importance to farming of adequate \ncapitalization and long term investment, and the elevation of the social status of the \nownership of productive agricultural land. \nIn this excellent account, which benefits from full access to Holkham archives, Dr. \nWade Martins has placed Thomas Coke within these contexts and has evaluated his \nrole in the events and attitudinal shifts of his time. An \u201cextrovert personality with \nlittle time or patience for academic pursuits\u201d, Coke played a leading role in Norfolk \nsociety, serving as county MP for over 50 years and, on the national stage, providing \nloyal support for his friend Charles James Fox in the Whig-Tory power struggles of \nthe Regency period. \nThe politics of the age are well summarized and integrated into the narrative. It is very \nwelcome that the rather paradoxical eighteenth century conception of Patriotism is \nexplored. Coke could describe himself as a patriot and, ultimately, accept a peerage as \nEarl of Leicester yet, by his own account, drink George Washington\u2019s health every \nevening during the American War of Independence. \nTo sustain his political life (pre-Reform elections were very expensive affairs) and \nposition in the county, the Holkham rent roll had to be maximized and Dr. Wade \nMartins describes this process thoroughly giving full credit to Coke\u2019s steward Francis \nBlaikie. \nToday, in large part due to the Holkham sheep shearings, Coke has his place in the \nBritish agricultural pantheon \u2013 Dr. Wade Martins provides something of a corrective \nto this as, indeed, Scott Watson and Hobbs did in \u201cGreat Farmers\u201d, published in 1951. \nCoke\u2019s agricultural contribution was, essentially, the fostering of an environment in \nPage 2 of 2 \nC:\\Documents and Settings\\bjones\\Desktop\\Susanna_Wade_Martins_review.doc \nwhich his tenant farmers could perform to the highest standards and where they, and \nhe, could exchange information and experiences. \nConvivial, sociable and revelling in county and national politics and field sports, Coke \nlived a personal life of immense vitality and obvious enthusiasms. After 21 years of \nwidowerhood, as a 68 year old he married his 18 year old goddaughter and fathered \nfive children in ten years. Though his enthusiasm did not extend to the application of \nscience to farming \u2013 he felt the new Royal Agricultural Society of England would do \n\u201cmore harm than good\u201d and regarded \u201call attempts to introduce chemistry as an \nengine of cultivation as a complete fallacy\u201d \u2013 he made his mark as one of the principal \narchitects, in the broadest sense, of the present-day British landscape. Even though \nfive generations have elapsed since his time, his influence is still evident. \nThis biography does Thomas Coke full justice, in style as well as in content. It is \nexcellently illustrated with colour and monochrome plates with helpful, discursive \ncaptions and specially drawn maps and diagrams. The bibliography and index are \nextensive and the book has been meticulously produced. Coke\u2019s memory is well \nserved by this first-rate piece of work. \n \nStephen J.G.
