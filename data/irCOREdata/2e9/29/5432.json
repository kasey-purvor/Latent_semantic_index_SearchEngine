But since 2000 the changes in campus university teaching have been\nmore limited than expected. I have drawn on ideas from organisational change\nmanagement research to investigate why this is happening in one particular\ncampus university context. My study examines the strategies of individual\nlecturers for adopting e-learning within their disciplinary, departmental and\nuniversity work environments to develop a conceptual framework for analysing\nuniversity learning and teaching as a complex adaptive system. This conceptual\nframework links the processes through which university teaching changes, the\nresulting forms of learning activity and the learning technologies used \u2013 all within\nthe organisational context of the university. The framework suggests that systemic\ntransformation of a university\u2019s learning and teaching requires coordinated change\nacross activities that have traditionally been managed separately in campus\nuniversities. Without such coordination, established ways of organising learning\nand teaching will reassert themselves, as support staff and lecturers seek to\noptimise their own work locally. The conceptual framework could inform\nstrategies for realising the full benefits of new learning technologies in other\ncampus universities.\nKeywords: e-learning adoption; complex adaptive systems; campus universities\nContext\nSince 2000 several studies in the UK, Australia and New Zealand have shown that the\nbenefits of e-learning have not been reaching mainstream learning and teaching in\ncampus universities (Bell et al. 2002; Marshall 2005; Sharpe et al. 2006). This has\ndisappointed expectations that learning technologies would enable universities to\nadapt to a context of changed student needs (Department of Education, Science and\nTraining (DEST) 2002; Harvey and Beards 2004; Higher Education Funding Council\nfor England (HEFCE) 2005; Scottish Funding Council (SFC) 2006). Surveys suggest\nthat campus universities lack coordinated strategies for use of new online learning\ntechnologies, and are relying on emergent local initiatives (Organisation for Economic\nCooperation and Development (OECD) 2005). In the University of New South Wales\n(UNSW) in Australia, a quality audit report commented on such a lack of coordination\n(Australian Universities Quality Agency (AUQA) 2006).\n*Email: carol.russell@unsw.edu.au\n4  C. Russell\nUNSW is a metropolitan campus-based university with 40,000 students, which has\nmajor research and teaching activities in business, medicine, engineering and the\napplied sciences. UNSW is one of the Group of Eight (Go8) that identify themselves\nas \u2018Australia\u2019s leading universities\u2019 and in which campus-based study is the norm,\nespecially at undergraduate level. UNSW is also a member of the Universitas 21\n(U21) international network of \u2018leading research-intensive universities\u2019.\nAt UNSW, use of the institutional online learning management system, both in\nterms of numbers of courses with an online presence and in terms of student enrolments\nin these courses, has been increasing steadily at over 30% a year since 2000. However,\nas in other campus universities, the online environment is primarily used for delivering\nlecture notes and administrative information. As part of a strategy for promoting inno-\nvative teaching using new learning technologies, UNSW introduced the Innovative\nTeaching and Educational Technology (ITET) Fellowships, a cross-discipline initia-\ntive involving a total of 75 staff in five six-month-long full-time Fellowship\nprogrammes between 2001 and 2006. The core data for this study came from one of\nthese ITET cohorts: 19 staff from a spread of disciplines, who were keen to introduce\ninnovations into their own teaching contexts. The Fellowship programme activities and\noutcomes are described elsewhere (Russell 2005; Russell and Lee 2005). In this paper\nI draw on work carried out for a PhD thesis (Russell 2008), in which I used complex\nadaptive systems theories of organisation to analyse individual strategies for adopting\ne-learning technologies in the UNSW context.\nThe university as a complex adaptive system\nUniversities have been described as \u2018supercomplex\u2019 (Barnett 2000). One aspect of this\ncomplexity is diversity, both in the relationships between disciplinary knowledge and\ndisciplinary organisation (Becher and Trowler 2001) and in how disciplinary knowl-\nedge, teaching and learning are perceived in relation to each other (Meister-Scheytt\nand Scheytt 2005; Robertson and Bond 2005).\nThere is a growing body of management literature that draws on concepts from\nevolutionary biology and from physical sciences to develop models of complex\norganisational change processes. By viewing the university as a living adaptive\nsystem we can build an integrated understanding of individual lecturers\u2019 decisions,\ntheir organisational context and the material learning technologies they use (including\neverything from books and blackboards to Web 2.0 e-learning tools); rather than\ndividing our understanding into separate areas of expertise. \nThe structure of living systems and their actual (material) components are complemen-\ntary yet distinct aspects of any biological explanation: they complement each other\nreciprocally but cannot be reduced to one another. (Varela and Maturana 1972)\nFigure 1 shows how the same basic organisational principles might apply to a univer-\nsity learning and teaching system. Processes of growth, learning and change interact\nwith the forms of learning and teaching, and with material learning technologies and\nresources (including physical and virtual learning spaces). Following Capra (2002), I\nuse a 3D tetrahedral shape as a building block for models at different organisational\nlevels (individual, department and university). The edges and faces of the tetrahedron\ncan represent particular research perspectives \u2013 the interplay of technology and forms\nof learning activity for example.\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   5\nFigure 1. A conceptual framework for modelling university learning and teaching systems, including the role of material technologies.Capra (2002) suggests that complex adaptive systems theory is not just a biologi-\ncal analogy for organisations, but represents the fundamental properties of all complex\nsystems, and can therefore be used as a rigorous model.\nModelling complexity and complementarities\nComplexity theories have been developed as rigorous modelling methods to gain\nunderstanding of different aspects of organisational change. Mathematical modelling\nbased on game theory takes into account the decisions of individuals and departments,\nas they each aim to optimise their own conditions locally.\nThese mathematical studies show that in any human organisation that is\nsufficiently complex to have local decision-making and optimisation, there will be\ninterdependent activities, called complementarities. For the organisation to continue\nfunctioning as a whole, change in one of these complementarities needs to be coordi-\nnated with change in the others. Change that is coordinated across the organisation\u2019s\nkey complementarities will always give a better result than piecemeal change. An\nFigure 1. A conceptual framework for modelling university learning and teaching systems,\nincluding the role of material technologies.\n6  C. Russell\nexample is the benefit to computer users of focusing on one or two standards, so\nas  to  ease the development of complementary operating systems, applications and\nhardware. Any standard is better than none.\nThe idea of complementarities was initially applied to explain the transition from\nmass manufacturing to flexible manufacturing systems (Milgrom and Roberts 1995).\nLater research, across many different types of organisation, provides further empirical\nevidence supporting the mathematical prediction that complementarities will be found\nin any large complex and diverse human organisation (Pettigrew et al. 2003). If\nuniversity learning and teaching is more like complex organic life than like a machine,\nsimplistic mechanistic models for \u2018engineering\u2019 change will not account for complex\ninternal organisational interdependencies (Kezar 2001).\nHowever, this raises a practical problem. Models are maps, simplified representa-\ntions of significant aspects of a complex reality. Any model that fully reflects the\ncomplexity of a system would be as difficult to understand as the system itself. It is\ntherefore better to work with a simple model where the limitations are explicit than to\nattempt to use a detailed and complex one (Cilliers 2001). How do we know what\nsimplifications we can make to navigate successfully through technology-supported\nchange in a university learning and teaching system without missing important\ninterdependencies?\nComplexity and diversity in university learning and teaching\nEmpirical research on one European university\u2019s response to government higher\neducation reforms suggests that universities are complex self-referential organisations\nin which defensive routines are widespread. The authors suggest that the culture is\nquasi-familial, with mental models and maps that are \u2018unspoken and inexpressible\u2019\nand that management should not aim to dissolve paradoxes, or reduce (cognitive)\ncomplexity, but should aim to open up alternative ways of thinking and acting.\n(Meister-Scheytt and Scheytt 2005).\nIndividual staff development is one way of opening up new ways of thinking, but\nstaff development on its own has had limited impact as a national strategy for trans-\nforming university learning and teaching in the UK (HEFCE 2005). There are reports\nthat staff development initiatives offered by educational specialists are largely failing\nto connect with university teaching practice (Trigwell and Shale 2004). Knowledge\nabout learning technology innovation is not spreading as fast as expected (Hannafin\nand Kim 2003; Oliver 2005) and as a result teaching practices have been failing to\nkeep up with student expectations (Oblinger 2005).\nCommunities of practice have been advocated as a less formal way of developing\nand spreading new knowledge about technologies and teaching (Allan and Banks 2003;\nBell 2003; Hunter 2003), but there are questions about whether communities of practice\nas defined by Wenger are either achievable or necessary (Wenger, McDermott, and\nSnyder 2002; Eraut 2002).\nAcademic disciplinary communities each have their own knowledge creation\nprocesses and forms of organisation (Becher and Trowler 2001). There are also disci-\nplinary differences in learning technology use (Russell 2005). Complex adaptive\nsystems models of organisations suggest that this internal diversity will enhance a\nuniversity\u2019s ability to adapt, but only if there are networks to link up the diverse\nperspectives, creating distributed cognition (van Fenema 2005). Rational allocation of\nresources, on the other hand, acts to reduce diversity (Andriani 2001). Some writers\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   7\non complexity in organisations focus on self-organisation, questioning the viability of\nintentional management and giving reasons why change cannot be managed (Griffin,\nShaw, and Stacey 1999; Stacey 2005). In most universities, however, accountability\nfor use of public funding requires both rational allocation of resources and intentional\nmanagement of change.\nIndividual lecturers\u2019 strategies are shaped by informal social systems and they are\nalso facilitated or constrained by formal organisation. The concept of the learning\norganisation can encompass both formal and informal, through individual and team\nlearning to change mental models, \u2018the images, assumptions and stories which we\ncarry in our minds of ourselves, other people, institutions and every aspect of the\nworld\u2019 (Senge et al. 1994, 235). This systemic approach allows for the integration of\nmultiple perspectives \u2013 formal and informal organisation, individual and social learn-\ning, and most importantly for this study human and technological systems.\nIn a university, individuals each have a different perspective on the organisation,\nbecause of their different academic or professional disciplines or their different\norganisational roles. The research I carried out in UNSW aimed to combine different\nindividual perspectives on adoption of new learning technologies, in order to iden-\ntify systemic patterns across the university\u2019s learning and teaching activities as a\nwhole.\nResearch methodology and methods\nThe research in UNSW arose initially from a need to evaluate the effectiveness of the\nITET Fellowship programme in transforming learning and teaching systems. Guided\nby examples from comparable higher education and change management research\ncontexts (Zuber-Skerritt 1992; Eden and Huxham 1996; Salmon 2001), I adopted an\naction research approach.\nIn their research into socio-technical organisational change, the London School of\nEconomics complexity research team used an action research methodology involving\ndifferent types of data. They advocate gathering data from individuals and from\ngroups, including both verbal and visual representations, the articulation of which\ncontributes to the change process \u2013 \u2018To use the language of complexity, when individ-\nual agents change their patterns of interaction new structures or new properties\nemerge\u2019 (Mitleton-Kelly 2003, 60). The INNFORM project, which applied complex-\nity theories in large-scale empirical research into innovative forms of organisation,\nalso adopted a multi-method approach (Pettigrew et al. 2003).\nAt the beginning of my research, I relied primarily on analysis of textual data from\ngroup discussions, interviews and questionnaires. However, as the research\nprogressed, I extended the range of data collection methods to visual representations,\nand in particular cognitive mapping.\nAction research phases\nThe first phase of my action research involved collecting and analysing textual data\nfrom discussions among the ITET Fellows, and their written comments about how the\nFellowship was influencing their strategies for use of learning technologies. Thematic\nanalysis of the text identified a large number of themes and sub-themes related to\ndisciplinary and organisational influences on the Fellows\u2019 strategies. But the text\nanalysis did not clarify how the Fellows were linking these themes.\n8  C. Russell\nThe early Fellowship programmes had elements of staff development, and\nincluded formal presentations on educational theory by specialists. Codified knowl-\nedge (theory), in the form of research papers and conferences, policies and guidelines,\ncan be transferred between contexts and teams, whereas tacit knowledge is shared\nonly when people work together (Edmondson et al. 2003). Codified knowledge also\nallows teachers to predict and plan. But analysis of the discussions and direct feedback\nfrom participants showed that they often rejected codified educational knowledge as\n\u2018a party line\u2019 (Russell 2003), preferring to focus on experiential and discipline-\nspecific knowledge. This response is consistent with reports on the difficulties of\nintroducing codified educational knowledge into university classroom teaching,\nbecause of its reliance on tacit and discipline-specific teaching strategies (Trowler and\nCooper 2002; Fanghanel 2004; Perkins 2006).\nThe fourth ITET programme therefore emphasised support for the development of\nshared knowledge within a cross-discipline community of practice (Russell and Lee\n2005).\nIn the second and third phases of the action research, I asked the Fellows from the\nfourth ITET programme to create visual representations, in the form of cognitive maps\nof their strategies for using e-learning, before and after the Fellowship programme.\nIn the final phase of the action research, I analysed the cognitive maps for patterns,\nand related these to evidence of change in the broader learning and teaching practices\nand support systems across the university, and the role of ITET Fellows in bringing\nabout these changes.\nCognitive mapping\nCognitive mapping has been developed as a way of eliciting and developing strategy\nin organisations (Eden and Ackermann 1998) and there is specialist software for\ncreating, editing and analysing patterns in the resulting maps. Cognitive maps are\nappropriate for eliciting lecturer strategies for using e-learning technologies for the\nfollowing reasons: \n(1) The maps are a visual representation, more suitable than (linear) spoken or\nwritten text for representing the multiple influences in individual thought and\naction.\n(2) The participants can articulate and think through complex tacit connections\nduring the interview. So the interview itself helps to develop and clarify strat-\negies for using educational technology, by making the tacit connections\nexplicit.\n(3) The mapping process allows for exploration and recording of the connections\nbetween the participants\u2019 disciplinary knowledge, their departmental context\nand their use of educational technology.\nI collected maps from each of the 19 participants, who represented a mix of disciplines\nand roles, before and after the ITET Fellowship programme. This provided two\nsnapshots of the various strategies across the group \u2013 the motivations and constraints\nfor using learning technologies in their teaching. Figure 2 shows one example of the\ncognitive maps, in which all the concepts and their categorisation and linking are\ndefined by the participant during an interview. The interview and map analysis\nmethods are documented in detail elsewhere (Russell 2008, Ch.5).\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   9\nFigure 2. A cognitive map of a strategy for adopting e-learning (shapes indicate concept categories).Results and interpretation\nPatterns found in cognitive maps\nI analysed the cognitive maps for concept link patterns corresponding to themes iden-\ntified from the research literature on educational technology and from the thematic\nanalysis of text from the first action research phase.\nDiscipline-related patterns\nPre-ITET, there are patterns of discipline-based difference in strategies for the use\nof educational technology \u2013 for example with those from soft applied disciplines\nsuch as social science had different patterns in their use of technology to those\nfrom  hard applied disciplines such as engineering (Becher and Trowler 2001). Post-\nITET, these differences are no longer discernable. Some of the pre-ITET strategy\npatterns appear more widely within the group post-ITET; while others disappear.\nDiscipline-specific beliefs about learning and teaching disappear post-ITET, and\ndisciplinary learning experiences are reframed as part of a broader educational\nknowledge. This provides some evidence that participation in a cross-discipline\ngroup can increase the range of strategies available to academics when they adopt\neducational technology.\nMove from individual to team focus\nPre-ITET strategies focus on individual concern for meeting students\u2019 needs. Post-ITET,\nthere are more strategies for working with others, in a departmental or cross-discipline\nFigure 2. A cognitive map of a strategy for adopting e-learning (shapes indicate concept\ncategories).\n10  C. Russell\nenvironment, to improve student learning. This is evidence that the Fellowship led to\nstrategies that are less individualistic, relate more to department and institutional\ncontexts and take more advantage of opportunities for cross-discipline collaboration\nand support.\nMotivation, confidence and constraints\nThe ITET Fellows are intrinsically motivated to use new technologies to improve\nlearning and teaching. Post-ITET, they are more aware of extrinsic motivators, such\nas external recognition of teaching, and support for planning of individual workloads.\nThey have also become more confident in influencing curriculum development. This\nis evidence that building shared educational knowledge that is explicit (codified)\nand externally acknowledged, within a cross-discipline community empowers the\nindividual teachers to make changes to learning and teaching systems and curricula in\nassociation with their use of e-learning technology.\nCoexisting with this increased confidence in the post-ITET strategies are assump-\ntions that research will continue to be valued more than teaching; along with continu-\ning concerns about being able to find support, resources and time for developing\nlearning and teaching. The post-ITET maps include strategies for dealing these\nconstraints.\nOrganisational data\nTo place the individual lecturer strategies in an organisational context, I triangulated\nit with other types of data on responses to e-learning within UNSW: \n\u25cf interviews and cognitive mapping with a traditional classroom teacher who does\nnot use e-learning;\n\u25cf published accounts of the development of Omnium, an e-learning innovation\nthat has been funded and supported as disciplinary research;\n\u25cf statistical reports on the uses of learning technologies across UNSW;\n\u25cf accounts (interviews and publications) of developments in one discipline area\nwhere there have been some systemic changes in learning and teaching;\n\u25cf analysis of the formal roles held by ITET Fellows across UNSW;\n\u25cf an interview with the UNSW senior manager responsible for the ITET\nprogramme.\nThe information from each of these is summarised next, with comments.\nLecturer perspectives\nThe traditional university lecturer, like the ITET Fellows, was intrinsically motivated\nto help students learn, but reported feeling isolated and discouraged by the departmen-\ntal context. This account exemplifies some of the constraints on innovation by indi-\nvidual teachers in a research-focused campus university environment. Without\nextrinsic motivation and support for teaching work, this lecturer was left to develop\npractices and theories by trial and error over many years.\nThis gives another perspective on reports in the higher education literature of the\nlack of connection between mainstream classroom practice in traditional campus\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   11\nuniversities and either educational theory or the opportunities afforded by e-\nlearning. Teachers either respond to departmental priorities and focus on disciplin-\nary research rather than innovative teaching, or follow their intrinsic motivation as\nteachers unsupported by colleagues \u2013 developing tacit knowledge that they are\nreluctant to abandon in favour of theories from educational experts outside the disci-\npline.\nDiscipline-specific innovation\nUNSW\u2019s College of Fine Arts invested in the development of Omnium, an online\nenvironment for design studies. The software environment has been used for a number\nof innovative international distance learning projects. However, the Omnium project\noverall is presented as disciplinary research. The Omnium environment is not\nintegrated into the UNSW online learning management system and is therefore not\navailable as a mainstream service for UNSW students.\nEach discipline has its own approaches to learning and teaching. Where an inno-\nvation is well adapted for one disciplinary environment, there is reluctance to make\nthe effort to adapt the innovation for other disciplines \u2013 especially when recognition\nfor the innovation is based upon an international discipline-specific community rather\nthan a cross-discipline local one. Therefore, even when an academic department has\nsupported development of an innovative learning technology, the research focus has\nlimited its application across the university.\nInstitutional use of learning technologies\nMost UNSW students are experiencing e-learning technology that primarily supports\ntraditional learning methods. Nevertheless some technological tools are beginning to\ninvolve teachers in more active use of the online environment to shape the nature of\nstudent learning: similarity detection tools, library systems, information literacy\nsupport and mathematical modelling tools. Students are demanding more digital\nlecture recordings and podcasts, and some lecturers are now beginning to use these\nrecordings to review their own lectures; effectively opening up the classroom to\nreflective teaching practice and linking it to the online environment.\nLearning technologies are becoming part of a change process \u2013 through mutual\nadjustments that involve students and technologies as much as through the actions of\nlecturers.\nSchool and faculty\nIn the Faculty of Science, the School of Physics was finding it difficult to engage first\nyear students in traditional recipe-type laboratory activities (Wilson and Russell 2003).\nClasses are large and involve organised teams of tutors and academics. Previous\nattempts to introduce innovations, even lab refurbishments, had changed little. One of\nthe two ITET Fellows in the school used an online diary to gather detailed evidence\non the student experience in the labs. The other helped to develop Web-based support\nfor lab work. When funding became available for a new lab building, conditional upon\nan educational rationale, the Fellows were able to provide evidence and practical solu-\ntions for the introduction of first-year lab projects, and for the new flexible lab spaces\n12  C. Russell\nand technologies to support this. The lab space, the projects and the required academic\nand tutor support systems are now well established.\nThe funding criteria for the new lab came from the dean of the faculty. ITET\nFellows also organised themselves at the faculty level to set up formal support for\nlearning and teaching. This is an example of complementarities spanning different\nlevels of organisation \u2013 community, department, faculty and institution. Systemic\nchange involved support from the institutional context that acted simultaneously\nupon the forms of learning and teaching, the processes of evaluating learning and\nteaching and the material facilities used for learning and teaching within the school\n(Figure 3).\nFigure 3. Changes in the UNSW School of Physics.Another UNSW faculty, of a similar size and with a similar number of ITET\nFellows, had no corresponding organised support in the faculty and showed no such\nsystemic changes.\nFormal organisational roles and changes\nThe ITET Fellows have a higher than average representation as staff in positions of\nformal influence on strategy, policy and teaching practice. This representation covers\ncore job functions (e.g. heads of schools, programme coordinators, associate deans)\nand membership of UNSW\u2019s policymaking committees.\nThis illustrates the interplay of formal and informal processes. The cross-\ndiscipline community is able to identify systemic issues that are not apparent from\nFigure 3. Changes in the UNSW School of Physics.\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   13\none disciplinary perspective, such as a need for extrinsic motivation through recogni-\ntion of teaching. The community members\u2019 formal organisational roles provide\nopportunities for changing university systems, for example to introduce more formal\nrecognition and support for teaching.\nInstitutional strategic leadership\nBefore 2000, UNSW had nobody on its senior management team with specific respon-\nsibility for learning and teaching. In 2000, an experienced senior academic with\ncredibility both as a researcher and as a teacher took on a new Pro Vice Chancellor\n(PVC) role and successfully argued for strategic funding for a package of initiatives\nthat included the ITET Fellowship. In discussions with the ITET Fellows, the PVC\nwas alerted to a number of institutional factors, including UNSW\u2019s internal funding\nstructures and promotion processes, which were hindering change in learning and\nteaching.\nSenior managers, like everyone else in the organisation, have only a partial\nunderstanding of the whole university system. In this case one senior manager not\nonly formally sponsored the ITET community as a strategic initiative, but also partic-\nipated actively in its discussions. This gave it a voice and an influence on institutional\npolicies and systems that an entirely informal self-organising community may not\nhave had.\nA postscript\nIn 2006 the PVC who was the main sponsor of the ITET Fellowship retired. A new\nVice Chancellor took office and restructured the UNSW senior management team,\nwith restructured portfolios. In 2006, the new Vice Chancellor identified strategic\ngoals for the institution as a research-focused university in which all academic staff\nwere required to be research-active, and in which the proportion of non-academic staff\nwas to be reduced (Hilmer 2006). However, by October 2007, UNSW had shown\nfurther improvements in external indicators of learning and teaching quality, including\nthe CEQ, ranking third nationally and outperforming all other Go8 universities\n(UNSW 2007). The additional funding resulting from government rewards for\nimproved learning and teaching outcomes has been allocated to further developments\nat the institutional level, including investment in e-learning and funding for Learning\nand teaching fellow posts in each faculty, who will work both in their own disciplines\nand as a cross-discipline group. There has been a systemic shift in learning and teach-\ning, some aspects of which may be irreversible.\nA systemic overview\nFigure 4 shows a systemic overview of influences on lecturer strategies in UNSW, in\nthe form of an annotated influence diagram based on the cognitive map analysis\nresults, triangulated with organisational data. Arrows indicate positive influences\nbetween binary concepts (in the form x \u2026 rather than y). In each concept the first part\nrepresents a component of the systemic change required for effective use of new learn-\ning technologies. The second part of each concept represents the corresponding\ncomponent of the traditional campus university learning and teaching system that will\nhinder change if left in place.\n14  C. Russell\nFigure 4. Contextual influences on individual teachers\u2019 strategies in UNSW.Figure 5 places these influences in the tetrahedral framework. Time and support\nfor academic participation in cross-discipline networks is a key process for enabling\nnew forms of learning activity using new technologies.\nFigure 5. Model of the changing UNSW learning and teaching system.\nDiscussion and conclusions\nUNSW is typical of many established campus universities where the majority of\nacademics are still using traditional disciplinary face-to-face methods, and where\nresearch often takes priority over teaching in academic work. The UNSW study found\nsome systemic patterns that influence the adoption and integration of e-learning,\nwhich have implications for the integration of new learning technologies in similar\ncampus universities.\nA survey of 21 Australian universities (Uys, Buchan, and Ward 2006) found that\nonly a third have any mainstream-funded support available for developing online\nlearning resources. Two-thirds have limited support for e-learning development or\nFigure 4. Contextual influences on individual teachers\u2019 strategies in UNSW.\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   15\nnone at all, and are relying on academics to do it for themselves. In campus\nuniversities, decisions about use of e-learning technology are typically being made by\nindividual lecturers. This dearth of support services is both a symptom and a cause of\nthe slow adoption of new learning technologies.\nComplexity theory explains why cross-discipline networking is an essential\ncomponent of the process of adaptation. It increases the diversity of options available\nto lecturers who are seeking to introduce technology-supported innovations into their\nteaching. Once new forms of learning activity are articulated and shared, they become\npart of codified organisational knowledge, which can be embedded in forms of\norganisation support and embodied in the associated material resources and facilities\n\u2013 policy guidelines, funding for support services, virtual and physical learning spaces.\nBy analysing cognitive maps from the same people before and after a cross-discipline\nexperience, and collating data on the corresponding institutional changes, I have been\nable to illustrate this process in one campus university context.\nComplexity theory also implies that sustainable change involves organisational\ncomplementarities. The ITET programme and the research with its participants\nidentified some key complementarities in the UNSW learning and teaching system.\nThese act between organisational levels, as shown in Figures 3\u20135; clarifying why\nstaff  development for individuals, on its own, is not enough to bring about change.\nFigure 6 illustrates how the tetrahedral framework might provide a starting point for\nFigure 5. Model of the changing UNSW learning and teaching system.\n16  C. Russell\nFigure 6.

National, institutional and disciplinary influences on e-learning adoption.This conceptual framework and the research methodology described here could be\napplied in other universities, to guide a systemic approach to adoption of new learning\ntechnologies. However, further research in other contexts is needed to validate the\nbroader applicability of this approach.\nAcknowledgements\nI thank Professor Gilly Salmon, University of Leicester, for her supervision of the PhD\nresearch upon which this paper is based, my colleagues at UNSW for providing the data, and\nthe anonymous reviewers for suggesting some improvements to the original submission.\nReferences\nAllan, B., and S.
