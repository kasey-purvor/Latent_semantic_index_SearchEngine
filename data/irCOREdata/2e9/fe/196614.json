The expression of TNF\u03b1 by macrophages and mast \ncells is critical for this relationship.\nBackground\nNon-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the world's lead-\ning cause of cancer related death. At present, the majority\nof patients present with advanced stages of disease which\nare not amenable to curative treatment. Even with the\noptimal presentation of stage Ia disease, the 5-year sur-\nvival is just 67% [1] assuming fitness for surgical resec-\ntion. Currently chemotherapy does not offer cure for\npatients with NSCLC. Thus, it is vital that new biomark-\ners of disease and novel therapies are developed. It is now\nrecognised that inflammatory and immune responses\nplay a key role in cancer development and prevention\n[2,3] and it hoped that manipulation of these may yield\nnovel therapies in the future.\nTumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF\u03b1) is a key and\nproximal component of many inflammatory pathways. It\nplays a key role in host defence to a variety of pathogens\n[4,5], but is also implicated in the promotion of many\ninflammatory diseases [6,7], including rheumatoid arthri-\ntis and inflammatory bowel disease.\nThe tumour biology of TNF\u03b1 however is complicated,\nwith evidence of both pro-tumourigenic and anti-\ntumourigenic activity in animal models [8,9]. Perhaps the\nbest evidence that the predominant role played by TNF\u03b1\nis anti-tumourigenic arises from studies of anti-TNF\u03b1\nstrategies for the treatment of inflammatory disease in\nman. These show a significant increase in the rate of neo-\nplastic disease in patients receiving active treatment, and\nno evidence of protection against cancer development\n[10-16]. The complete resolution of NSCLC in a patient\nfollowing withdrawal of anti-TNF\u03b1 therapy is also\ndescribed [17]. In contrast, the administration of anti-\nTNF\u03b1 has had no significant effect on the progression of\nseveral advanced cancers [18-20].

BMC Cancer 2010, 10:323\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2407\/10\/323\nPage 2 of 9nant TNF\u03b1 is a useful and licensed adjunctive treatment\nfor sarcoma and melanoma [21,22].\nThere is therefore debate as to whether or not TNF\u03b1\nplays a role in NSCLC tumour cytotoxicity or conversely,\ntumour progression. Two small studies investigated pre-\nviously the mRNA or protein expression of TNF\u03b1 in\nNSCLC, and suggested overall that TNF\u03b1 expression was\neither mildly beneficial but not an independent factor\n[23] or neutral [24], respectively. However, the anatomi-\ncal localisation of the TNF\u03b1 expressed was not taken into\naccount. We have shown previously that the site of\ninflammatory cell infiltration in NSCLC is critical in\nterms of prognosis. Patients with high expression of mac-\nrophages in the tumour islets have extended survival\nindependently of tumour stage, and these macrophages\ndemonstrate high expression of TNF\u03b1 and other cyto-\ntoxic markers, suggesting they are of an anti-tumouri-\ngenic cytotoxic M1 macrophage phenotype [25,26].\nThis previous work investigating TNF\u03b1 expression in\nmacrophages was aimed primarily at determining the\nphenotype of these cells rather than the prognostic signif-\nicance of TNF\u03b1 expression. Due to the nature of the\nwork, relatively small numbers of patients were studied.\nThe aim of this study was therefore to assess the prognos-\ntic significance of TNF\u03b1 expression, irrespective of cell\ntype in NSCLC, paying particular attention to its anatom-\nical microlocalisation, in surgically resected NSCLC in\nour complete cohort of patients described previously\n[26].\nMethods\nStudy Population\nThe study was approved by the Leicestershire Research\nEthics Committee. The tissue specimens evaluated were\nfrom patients with NSCLC who had undergone resection\nwith curative intent at the University Hospitals of Leices-\nter National Health Service Trust (Leicester, United King-\ndom). These patients had resections during two periods -\none dating from 1991 to 1994 and the second from Janu-\nary to December 1999. This cohort of patients has been\ndescribed previously [26]. Of note, due to exhaustion of\ntumour tissue, 133 patient samples with >60 day survival\npost surgery were available for analysis in this study. Of\nthe 133 patients studied, 88 were men and average age at\nsurgery was 65.8 years (standard deviation, 9.8; range, 33\nto 82 years). Full clinicopathologic information was gath-\nered before and after surgery, including patient character-\nistics, treatment, combined clinical and surgical staging\nresults (preoperative staging by computed tomography\nscan, selective mediastinoscopy, and systematic lymph\nnode sampling at operation), histologic subtype, tumour\ngrade, and survival data. Patients were divided into two\ngroups: above median survival (AMS) (mean \u00b1 SEM 84.0\n\u00b1 5.1 months) and below median survival (BMS) (mean \u00b1\nSEM 10.8 \u00b1 0.8 months). Macrophage-associated TNF\u03b1\nexpression has been described previously in 26 of these\npatients [25].

Only blocks containing the advancing edge of\nthe primary tumour were evaluated. Tissue sections of 4\n\u03bcm thickness were cut onto glass slides and then de-\nwaxed in xylene and rehydrated through graded alcohols.\nAntigen retrieval was carried out using Trilogy Antigen\nRetrieval solution (Cell Marque, Hot Springs, United\nStates of America) in a pressure cooker (heated to\n117.5\u00b0C for 1 min and then cooled to 100\u00b0C for 30 sec-\nonds). TNF\u03b1 mouse antihuman antibody was used (clone\nP\/T2; Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom). Immunos-\ntaining was performed and TNF\u03b1 was developed with\nperoxidase and 3,3'-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride\n(brown reaction product). Sections were then counter-\nstained with haematoxylin and mounted in an aqueous\nmounting medium (BDH Chemicals Ltd, Poole, United\nKingdom). Appropriate isotype controls were performed\nwhere the primary antibodies were replaced by irrelevant\nmouse mAb of the same isotype and at the same concen-\ntration as the specific primary mAb. To assess whether\nTNF\u03b1 + cells were localised to mast cells, a double-stain\ntechnique described previously by us was used [25,26],\nwith the mouse monoclonal antibody to human tryptase\n(clone AA1, Dako Cytomation, Ely, Cambridgeshire,\nUnited Kingdom) employed to identify mast cells.\nAnalysis and Validation of Immunostaining\nAnalysis was performed blind with respect to the clinical\noutcome. The ten most representative high-power fields\n(x400) per slide were manually selected using an Olym-\npus BX50 microscope (Olympus, Southall, United King-\ndom). The respective areas of stroma and tumour islets\nwere then measured at x400 magnification using Analysis\nimaging software (Soft Imaging System GmbH). The\nnumber of nucleated cells with positive staining for TNF\u03b1\nin each area were then counted manually and expressed\nas cells\/mm2 of stroma or tumour islets. Analysis was\nrepeated for 20 patients to assess repeatability and valid-\nity.\nStatistical Analysis\nStatistical analyses were carried out using the GraphPad\nPrism software package (v. 4.02; GraphPad Prism Soft-\nware Inc, San Diego, CA). For categoric analysis, the\nmedian value was used as a cut point to dichotomise the\nseries. The \u03c72 test was used to test for relationships\nbetween categoric variables, and the Mann-Whitney\nnonparametric test was used to compare categoric with\ncontinuous variables. The Kruskal-Wallis one-way analy-\nsis of variance test was used to compare multiple groups.\nKaplan-Meier survival curves were used to look for cor-\nrelations with survival and were compared with the use of\nthe log-rank statistic. For the above comparisons, p < 0.05\nwas considered statistically significant. A multivariate\nCox proportional hazards model was used to estimate\nadjusted hazard ratios, 95% CIs, and to identify which of\nthe macrophage markers were independent prognostic\nfactors using the Statistical Package for the Social Sci-\nences (SPSS, v. 13.0; SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). The validity\nof the proportional hazards assumption was assessed\nfrom log(-log [Survival]) curves.\nResults\nPatient Characteristics\nPatent characteristics are shown in Table 1. Of the 133\npatients studied, 110 had died at the time of analysis.\nThirty-day mortality for the cohort was 4% and patients\nwho died within the first 60 days of surgery were not\nincluded in this analysis. Sixty-eight tumours were\nsquamous, 42 adenocarcinoma, 12 large cell, and 11\nother. Sixty were stage I, 37 stage II, 32 stage IIIa, and four\nstage IIIb or IV. Two patients had additional postopera-\ntive chemotherapy and 20 had additional radiotherapy, 16\nof whom had it for later palliation. Neither had any effect\non survival. The overall 5-year survival was 31.3%.\nValidation of Analysis\nClear and distinguishable staining was evident for TNF\u03b1\n(Figure 1). Appropriate isotype controls were negative. In\norder to assess the validity of the method, area measure-\nments and cell counts were repeated and intraclass corre-\nlation coefficients calculated. Good correlations were\nfound for both: 0.997 (95% CI, 0.996 to 0.998, p < 0.001)\nand 0.994 (95% CI, 0.992 to 0.996, p < 0.001). This\nmethod of analysis has also been validated by our group\npreviously [26].\nCellular Distribution\nThere was increased expression of TNF\u03b1 in the tumour\nislets of patients with AMS compared to those with BMS\n(median 27.2 versus 18.8 cells\/mm2 respectively, p =\n0.006). There was no significant difference in the expres-\nsion of stromal TNF\u03b1 between the two groups (AMS 23.8\nversus BMS 16.8 cells\/mm2, p = 0.31) (Figures 2A and\n2B).\nFigure 1 Immunohistology demonstrating positive TNF\u03b1 expres-\nsion (brown).

Spearman's rank correlation\ncoefficient was calculated to assess any potential relation-\nship with survival. A direct relationship between tumour\nislet TNF\u03b1 density and survival was noted (rs = 0.213, p =\n0.01). No significant relationship was seen between sur-\nvival and stromal TNF\u03b1 density (rs = -0.01, p = 0.90).\nKaplan-Meier Survival Analysis\nFor further analysis, the data were divided into two or\nthree equal groups according to TNF\u03b1 density. Kaplan-\nMeier survival curves were plotted and the log-rank sta-\ntistic used to compare survival rates. When looking at\ntwo groups separated by the median, there was a non-sig-\nnificant trend for improved survival with above median\nTNF\u03b1 expression in the tumour islets (p = 0.15, not\nshown). When divided into tertiles, there was signifi-\ncantly improved survival in the top tertile of TNF\u03b1\nexpression in the tumour islets compared to the middle\nand lower tertiles (Figure 4A). Thus patients with high\nislet TNF\u03b1 expression (upper tertile) were noted to have a\nsignificantly higher 5-year predicted survival as opposed\nto patients with low TNF\u03b1 expression (lower tertile) (43%\nversus 22%, p = 0.01). There was no significant relation-\nship between TNF\u03b1 expression in the stroma and survival\n(Figure 4B). Similar differences in survival with respect to\nTNF\u03b1 expression in the tumour islets were also evident\nwithin tumour stages (Figure 5), although the differences\ndid not reach statistical significance due to the smaller\nnumbers within each stage. Interestingly, patients with\nstage IIIa disease in the top tertile of islet TNF\u03b1 expres-\nsion had a 5 year survival of 25% compared to 26% sur-\nvival for those patients with stage I disease in the lower\ntertile of islet TNF\u03b1 expression.\nMultivariate Cox Proportional Hazards Analysis\nA Multivariate Cox Proportional Hazards model was\nused to estimate adjusted hazard ratios, 95% CIs, and to\nassess whether TNF\u03b1 islet or stromal counts were inde-\npendent prognostic factors, using a forward stepwise\nFigure 2 TNF\u03b1 densities in Above Median Survival (AMS) and Below Median Survival (BMS) patients in the tumour islets (A) and stroma (B).\n \n \n \n \n \n \np=0.006\nAMS BMS\n0\n100\n200\n300\nA\nD\nen\nsi\nty\n o\nf c\ne\nlls\n\/m\nm\n2\nin\n \nth\ne\n \nis\nle\nts\np=0.31\nAMS BMS\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n425\n450\nB\nDe\nn\nsi\nty\n o\nf c\ne\nlls\n\/m\nm\n2\nin\n \nth\ne \ns\ntr\nom\na\nFigure 3 Raw data of cell counts expressing TNF\u03b1 plotted against \nsurvival in days in the tumour islets (A) and stroma (B).\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400 Spearman r = 0.213\np = 0.01\nA\nSurvival (Days)\nIs\nle\nt T\nN\nF \nde\nn\nsi\nty\nce\nlls\n\/m\nm\n2\n0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400 Spearman r = -0.01\np = 0.90\nB\nSurvival (Days)\nSt\nro\nm\nal\n \nTN\nF \nde\nn\nsi\nty\nce\nlls\n\/m\nm\n2\nOhri et al.

Results of the multi-\nvariate analysis are shown in Table 2. Continuous vari-\nables were used for islet and stromal TNF\u03b1. For every\nincrease of 1 in the value of the variable, the hazard\nincreases by the value of the hazard ratio. Expression of\nTNF\u03b1 in the tumour islets emerged as a significant inde-\npendent predictor of survival (hazard ratio 0.995, 95% CI\n0.989 to 1.000, p = 0.048). Surprisingly, expression of\nTNF\u03b1 in the tumour stroma emerged as a significant\nindependent predictor of reduced survival (hazard ratio\n1.007, 95% CI 1.002 to 1.011, p = 0.007). There was no\nevidence of violation of the proportional hazards assump-\ntion.\nCellular localisation of TNF\u03b1\nWe have shown previously that in patients with extended\nsurvival, there is increased expression of macrophages in\nthe tumour islets compared to patients with poor survival\n[26], and that in a separate study the majority of tumour\nislet macrophages expressed TNF\u03b1 [25]. Macrophages\naccounted for approximately 60% of the TNF\u03b1 + cells in\nthe extended survival patients. While there was a marked\ndifference in the number of TNF\u03b1 + macrophages\nbetween extended survival and poor survival islets [25], it\nis evident from Figure 2 that the difference in total TNF\u03b1\nexpression in this cohort of 133 patients is not so marked.\nBased on morphology, it was considered that a propor-\ntion of the TNF\u03b1 + cells that were not macrophages may\nbe mast cells. We therefore analysed the cellular distribu-\ntion of TNF\u03b1 expressed by mast cells (Figure 6) in the\nsubset of samples previously stained for macrophage-\nTNF\u03b1 (AMS [n = 20] and BMS [n = 20]) [25]. In keeping\nwith our previous observations [26], mast cell numbers\nwere significantly increased in the islets of the AMS com-\npared to BMS patients (medians 22.6 versus 0.7 cells\/\nmm2, p < 0.001). Interestingly, mast cells accounted for\n45.2% of TNF\u03b1 expression in the islets of the AMS\npatients, but only 5.2% of the BMS patients (Table 3)(p <\n0.001). Thus taking macrophage and mast cell-associated\nTNF\u03b1 together, approximately 100% of islet TNF\u03b1 was\nlocalized to mast cells or macrophages in the subset of\nAMS patients studied, while in the islets of the subset of\nBMS patients studied, only 28% of TNF\u03b1 immunoreactiv-\nity was localized to these cells (Table 3) (p < 0.001). Simi-\nlar results were evident in the tumour stroma (Table 3, p\n< 0.001). This is interesting because it demonstrates that\nin BMS patients, there is robust TNF\u03b1 expression by cells\nother than macrophages and mast cells. These cells were\npredominantly mononuclear cells and rarely tumour epi-\nthelial cells. This suggests that TNF\u03b1 is highly beneficial\nonly when localized to macrophages and mast cells in\ntumour islets, and not when expressed by other cell types.\nFigure 4 Kaplan-Meier five year survival curve for TNF\u03b1 densities \nin the tumour islets (A) and stroma (B) divided into high counts \n(upper tertile), midrange counts (middle tertile) and low counts \n(lower tertile).

BMC Cancer 2010, 10:323\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2407\/10\/323\nPage 7 of 9Discussion and Conclusions\nThe purpose of this study was to investigate the relation-\nship between the microanatomical expression of TNF\u03b1\nand survival in surgically resected NSCLC. The results\ndemonstrate that expression of TNF\u03b1 in the tumour islets\nis associated with a significant increase in 5-year survival,\nindependently of other favorable prognostic factors\nincluding stage, and that TNF\u03b1 expression in the stroma\nis an independent predictor of reduced survival.\nThe role of TNF\u03b1 in tumour biology remains contro-\nversial with both pro-tumourigenic and anti-tumouri-\ngenic properties identified [8-10,21,27]. Two small\nprevious studies of patients with NSCLC suggested TNF\u03b1\nexpression had little relationship to clinical outcome, but\nthese did not distinguish between expression in tumour\nstroma and epithelial islets. The biology of these two\ntumour compartments demonstrates profound differ-\nences in matrix composition, cellular content and vascu-\nlarity. Our previous studies [25,26] have demonstrated\nthe importance of anatomical microlocalisation in terms\nof potential sites for cytotoxicity against tumours. The\nkey findings of these studies was that tumour epithelial\nislets are the likely site of host cytotoxic responses against\ntumour progression because patients with extended sur-\nvival have infiltration of their tumour islets with mast\ncells and macrophages [25,26]. Many cytokine-dependent\neffects are mediated through localized cell-cell contact,\nincluding the presentation of membrane-bound TNF\u03b1 to\nTNF\u03b1-receptor + cells [28]. The effects of cytokines\nincluding TNF\u03b1 on tumour stroma versus islets are there-\nfore likely to vary profoundly depending on the site of\nrelease, and the cell-cell interactions between TNF\u03b1-pro-\nducing cells and the cells they interact with. We therefore\nanalysed TNF\u03b1 expression with close attention to expres-\nsion in the stroma versus the tumour islets.\nIn keeping with biological relevance of this concept,\npatients with AMS survival had greater immunoreactive\nTNF\u03b1 expression in their tumour islets compared to\nthose with BMS, and there was a positive correlation\nbetween increasing islet TNF\u03b1 + cell density and survival.\nIn addition, when our patient cohort was divided into ter-\ntiles according to islet TNF\u03b1 + cell density we observed\nthat patients with high expression (upper tertile) had sig-\nnificantly improved 5-year survival. Thus increasing\nexpression of TNF\u03b1 in the tumour islets was associated\nwith a significant increase in 5-year survival, indepen-\ndently of other favorable prognostic factors. Conversely,\nalthough the density of TNF\u03b1 + cells in the stroma was\nsimilar in AMS and BMS patients, TNF\u03b1 expression in\nthe stroma emerged as an independent predictor of\nreduced survival following Cox regression analysis. These\nresults indicate that the micro-anatomical location of\nTNF\u03b1 expression is potentially critical in determining its\nrole in tumour biology.\nTumour stage is a key determinant of survival following\nsurgery for NSCLC [1]. We were able to show that the\nrelationship between survival and islet TNF\u03b1 expression\nwas evident within tumour stages although due to the rel-\natively small numbers for each stage the differences did\nnot reach statistical significance. Patients with stage I dis-\nease survive longer than patients with stage IIIa disease\n[1]. However, when tumour islet TNF\u03b1 expression was\ncompared by stage with respect to survival, it was of note\nthat patients with stage IIIa NSCLC and high TNF\u03b1\nexpression had a 5-year survival of 25%, comparable to\nthat of stage I NSCLC patients with low TNF\u03b1 expres-\nsion, who had a 5-year survival of 26%. Conversely,\npatients with stage I NSCLC and high TNF\u03b1 expression\nhave a 5-year survival of 46%. This suggests that TNF\u03b1\nexpression within tumour islets is therefore a key deter-\nminant of NSCLC survival within stage, even within early\nstage disease.\nA striking observation from this study was the cellular\ndistribution of TNF\u03b1 immunoreactivity in the tumour\nislets of patients with extended survival compared to\nthose with poor survival. The macrophages which infil-\ntrate the tumour islets in NSCLC are predominantly of\nthe M1 cytotoxic phenotype [25] which express TNF\u03b1.\nWe have extended this work in the current study and\nshow that mast cells within the tumour islets also express\nTNF\u03b1. What is striking, however, is that in the subset of\npatients with extended survival, all TNF\u03b1 islet immuno-\nreactivity was accounted for by macrophages and mast\ncells. In the subset of patients with poor survival, TNF\u03b1\nexpression in the islets was also evident, but was rarely\npresent in mast cells or macrophages. Thus it is not only\nFigure 6 Mast cell immunohistochemical double-staining \ntryptase (brown) and TNF\u03b1 (red) demonstrating the presence of \nTNF\u03b1 in tryptase + mast cells.

In support of this, although\nthere was no difference in the stromal density of TNF\u03b1 +\ncells in AMS versus BMS patients, increasing stromal\nTNF\u03b1 expression emerged as an independent predictor\nof worse survival. Whether this is due to the effects of\nTNF\u03b1 on the stroma or a reflection of the inability of\npotentially beneficial TNF\u03b1-expressing macrophages and\nmast cells to infiltrate the islets is not known. The latter\ncould be explained by an inappropriate chemokine reper-\ntoire released by the tumour stroma or even by a physical\nbarrier, such as a thickened basement membrane,\nbetween the stroma and tumour islets.\nThe results of this study add to our previous work and\nhave important clinical implications. We have shown that\nthe density of TNF\u03b1 + cells in tumour islets is a predictor\nof extended survival in NSCLC following surgery. Its\nlocalization to macrophages and mast cells in the tumour\nislets is the key factor relating to improved prognosis, and\nit seems unlikely that anti-TNF\u03b1 strategies will be benefi-\ncial to such patients. In contrast, in poor prognosis\npatients whose tumours contain relatively few TNF\u03b1 +\nmacrophages and\/or mast cells, anti-TNF\u03b1 strategies may\nbe worthy of further study as stromal expression is an\nindependent predictor of poor survival. In view of the\nmarked microanatomical and immunological heteroge-\nneity within the tumour microenvironment in NSCLC, it\nis essential that attention is paid to this principle in future\nimmunomodulatory trials in this disease. Targeting sub-\nphenotypes of disease with immunopathology predicted\nto respond to the intervention may then lead to the devel-\nopment of better anti-neoplastic therapeutic strategies.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nCO carried out the immunohistochemical staining, slide analysis, statistical\nanalysis and prepared the manuscript.
