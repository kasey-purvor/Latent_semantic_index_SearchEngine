This paper describes and illustrates a model that has been\ndeveloped to enable evaluations of the costs and benefits of the use of ICT. The strengths\nand limitations of the model are highlighted and discussed.\nIntroduction\nHigher education (HE) institutions are currently investing heavily in information and\ncommunications technology (ICT) to support teaching and learning. As a result, senior\nmanagers, policy-makers and the funding councils are becoming increasingly concerned\nthat more systematic information be made available about the costs and benefits of these\nactivities so as to inform investment decisions (HEFCE, 1998).\nIn recent years, there has been growing interest in developing models for identifying and\nanalysing the full costs associated with ICT-supported teaching and learning activities (for\na review, see Ash and Bacsich, 2002). Over this same period, there has also been consider-\nable research into ways of evaluating the benefits of ICT for teaching and learning.\nHowever, with perhaps a few exceptions (for example, Collis and Moonen, 2001), there is\nstill almost no published literature linking costs and benefits together within a single\nframework or model that could be used to compare the relative merits of different\ninvestment decisions. Most cost-benefit studies are limited in scope usually involving\ncomparisons of a course delivered at a distance with the same course delivered face-to-\n46\nALT-] Volume 11 Number 2\nface; and there are few studies that deal with situations where computer-supported and\nface-to-face learning methods are integrated rather than separate.\nThere are two interrelated reasons why research on costs and benefits in HE have\nprogressed separately. Firstly, each area (costs and benefits) has its own distinct method-\nologies. The rationale for cost evaluation is based on systematic data collection,\nquantitative analysis and measurable outputs (for example, monetary, staff time) whereas\nbenefits evaluation relies on indirect and subjective data collection that leads to qualitative\nanalysis (for example, reports of learning gains rather than actual measures). These\ndifferences make it difficult to construct a single framework or model that might relate the\ntwo areas together. Secondly, within institutions, those tasked with cost analysis normally\nhave little expertise in benefits evaluation and those with benefits expertise have little\ncosting experience, and these groups rarely work together.\nThis paper describes the outcome of a UK project that was aimed at developing a model\nand methodology to evaluate the costs and benefits of the use of ICT in teaching and\nlearning in HE. This work was funded by the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC)\nand the cost-benefit model that is proposed is called the INSIGHT model.\nThe INSIGHT cost-benefit model was conceptualized as a decision-support tool for senior\nmanagers in HE tasked with making investment decisions about initiatives in technology-\nsupported teaching. The model comprises a general framework for cost-benefit evaluation\nand an associated methodology. A basic assumption of the model is that decision-makers\nrely as much on qualitative information (for example, about impact or benefits) as on\nquantitative cost information to inform their reasoning (Oliver, Conole and Bonetti, 1999).\nThe model is flexible in that the cost and benefit categories utilized can be adapted to meet\nthe needs of different stakeholders and institutional contexts (see Patton, 1997 on\nutilization-focused evaluation). It is also assumed that decision-makers would be actively\ninvolved in discussions about strategic priorities and about the output values. It is\nconsidered unlikely that the output of any cost-benefit evaluation would ever be accepted\nunquestioningly. Therefore, undertaking the 'journey' through the analysis that the\nINSIGHT model proposes is considered as valuable as getting to the final 'destination' (the\noutput ratio of a cost-benefit evaluation).\nResearch on cost and benefits of ICT-supported learning\nThe first step in developing a cost-benefit model is to identify and apportion all costs\nassociated with a specific ICT-supported teaching and learning activity and to identify the\nbenefits that derive from that activity. There are, however, barriers to the achievement of\nthese conditions.\nExisting financial systems rarely contain the required cost information\nMoonen (1997) has identified some reasons why costs information is difficult to access and\nquantify in HE. One problem is the lack of systematic collection of cost data. Institutional\nfinance systems are usually organized in relation to the dual requirement of recording\nfinancial transactions and providing budgetary control. Unlike large commercial organiza-\ntions, it is rare to find sophisticated costing systems geared to providing routine\ninformation on the costs of specific activities such as courses or classes (Bacsich, Ash and\n47\nDavid Nicol and Michael Coen A model for evaluating the institutional costs and benefits of ICT initiatives\nHeginbotham, 2001). Moreover, few institutions have systems capable of apportioning\ncentral costs, such as the cost of a network, to local activities at academic department level.\nOther reasons given by Moonen for the inability to cost ICT initiatives include disagree-\nment amongst researchers about which costs should be taken into account, the instability\nand evolving nature of costs and the confidentiality of some costing information.\nHowever, cultural barriers are probably the most important impediment to systematic\ncosting practices within HE (Bacsich et al., 2001; Cropper and Cook, 2000). Systematic\ncosting, as applied in commercial models, would require that institutions adopt procedures\nwhereby staff keep records of time spent on different activities (for example, teaching,\nresearch, administration) and this is counter to the culture of HE. Nonetheless, recent\ndevelopments in HE such as the Transparency Review are challenging this culture (Joint\nCosting and Pricing Steering Group, 1999).\nEvaluation of benefits tends to be too narrowly defined\nThe benefits of ICT innovations in HE are normally evaluated from a fairly narrow\npedagogical perspective (Gunn, 1997). The main concern is usually with the learning\nbenefits deriving from an ICT innovation although these measures of learning gain are\nalmost always indirect (for example, confidence logs where students rate their grasp of\nunderlying principles) rather than direct (for example, examination marks). Few studies\nevaluate the benefits from the wider institutional perspective; for example, the benefits that\nan ICT initiative in teaching might have for organizational processes within the institution\n(for example, improved communication), or for the external standing of the institution (for\nexample, its public image). There is a need for a framework that goes beyond educational\nbenefits and starts to identify 'hidden benefits' at other levels within an HE institution.\nBenefits are rarely considered in relation to the strategic objectives of the\ninstitution\nThe benefits of an ICT initiative are rarely considered in relation to the overall goals of the\nHE institution as defined in its mission statement, strategic objectives or learning strategy\n(Collis and Moonen, 2001). An ICT initiative that helped progress an institution's strategic\nobjectives should be judged of higher value (the benefits should be considered greater)\nthan a comparable initiative that did not progress those objectives. For example, consider\nan innovation which involved giving students laptops with radio cards to improve their\naccess to learning resources which in turn required that a wireless network be constructed\nin a specific department. In this case, the benefits accruing to this initiative might be rated\nmore highly if the university had to develop, as one of its strategic objectives, a wireless\nnetworked campus than if this was not an objective.\nThe contribution of ICT in teaching and learning cannot be isolated\nIt can be difficult to attribute benefits to a specific aspect of a teaching and learning\nsituation. For example, Draper, Brown, Henderson and McAteer (1996) have argued that\nall factors in a teaching and learning situation interact and that it is not possible to isolate\nthe benefits of ICT from the wider context or to determine causal relationships. When ICT\nis introduced to support an existing educational system there will necessarily be associated\nchanges in other areas, for example, teacher roles, student motivation, resource availability\nor course organization processes.\n48\nALT-] Volume 11 Number 2\nComparing benefits across ICT projects is problematic\nAnother important issue is the absence of evaluation methodologies, or criteria, that would\nallow one to compare benefits reliably across different ICT projects (Draper, 1997; Jones,\nBarnard, Calder, Scanlon and Thompson, 2000). Comparisons across ICT projects are\ncrucial to the making of investment decisions, yet, in most evaluations of ICT-based\neducation the methodologies are tailored to the specific teaching context. Moreover,\ntriangulation, using multiple evaluation instruments, is a recommended practice in order to\nbe able to draw more robust conclusions about benefits (Rossi and Freeman, 1993). Yet,\nsome commonality of evaluation methods or criteria would seem to be a prerequisite for\ncross-project comparisons. A further difficulty is that the value assigned to benefits may\nvary depending on the stakeholder, for example, teacher, senior manager (see Anderson,\nHaywood, Heywood, Land and Macleod, 2002).\nCommentary\nThere are no simple solutions to the above problems. Decision-makers and researchers\nmust accept that it will not be possible to obtain exact measures of costs and benefits and\nthat there will always be a great deal of subjectivity in cost-benefit evaluation.\nFurthermore, there is no point in having precision in one area (costs) when evaluations in\nthe other area (benefits) are likely to be highly subjective. The INSIGHT model tries to\nstrike a balance in relation to costs and benefits by providing a framework that is\npragmatic and flexible. On the costs side, a high-level approach is adopted that should be\nworkable within current institutional financial systems. On the benefits side, the model\nattempts to support subjective judgements by suggesting ways in which evaluation criteria\ncan be made more explicit and weighted in relation to institutional goals. The overall focus\nof the model has been to develop procedures that would support more systematic thinking\nabout cost-benefit relationships.\nA framework for the evaluation of costs\nIdentifying costs\nThe main difficulty in costing ICT-supported teaching and learning activities is identifying\nthe full range of costs associated with those activities. Where a course is Web-based the\nICT-related resources (human and material) utilized in providing that course extend\nbeyond those incurred by the academic department. The network hardware, the software,\nthe ICT support services, and even the cost of housing the Web server, are all part of the\ncost of that Web-based provision.\nIn industry, activity-based costing (ABC) is a widely adopted technique to assess the full\ncosts of different activities within an organization. ABC assigns costs in relation to\ndifferent types of activities taking into account that these activities will often cut across\norganizational boundaries. Although ABC is not common in HE, this method of costing\napportionment has been investigated and trialled by Bacsich and his co-workers (Bacsich\net al, 1999; Bacsich et al, 2001). Implementation of ABC is very costly, complex and time-\nconsuming. This has resulted in significant resistance to its introduction to HE. In\nresponse to these difficulties the approach adopted here has been to take a pragmatic and\nhigh-level approach to the attribution of costs to activities.\n49\nDavid Nicol and Michael Coen A model for evaluating the institutional costs and benefits of ICT initiatives\nApportioning costs\nThree distinct types of cost centre have been identified as relevant in the development of a\ncosting framework for ICT-supported teaching and learning activities: infrastructure;\nvalue-added and support. Infrastructure cost centres are used to collect the total cost of\nownership for ICT assets. For example, the total cost of ownership of a network server\nwould encompass not only the acquisition costs but also licensing costs and external\nsupport contracts.\nValue-added activities comprise any activity in an institution which results in the\ngeneration of external benefit (financial or otherwise) and which is undertaken in pursuit\nof the institution's primary objectives. Teaching and learning, research, commercial\nexploitation of knowledge, residences and catering are value-added activities in higher\nBENEFITS\nEDUCATIONAL ORGANISATIONAL EXTERNAL\nV\nCOSTS\nCAPITAL\nCOSTS\nREVENUE\nCOSTS\nSTAFF\nCOSTS\nOVERHEADS\nFigure I: The cost benefit model depicting the allocation of costs to value-added\nactivities and the categories of benefit deriving from those activities\n50\nALT-] Volume 11 Number 2\neducation (Joint Funding Councils, 1997). All other activities within an institution can be\ndefined as 'support activities'. This would encompass administrative and academic support\nfunctions including central ICT support functions. The focus of this paper is value-added\nactivities relating to teaching and learning.\nGiven that not all costs can be directly attributed to value-added activities, the ABC\napproach involves apportionment of costs from other cost centres. In Figure 1 this is\ndepicted by the horizontal arrows from infrastructure and support costs, to value-added\nactivities.\nCost categories\nIn order to develop a workable model for costing it is necessary to categorize costs into\ngeneric types that are dealt with in broadly similar ways. Figure 1 also depicts the four\ntypes of costs that have been identified as critical to the model - capital, revenue, staff costs\nand overheads - although other costing categories could easily be accommodated.\nStaff costs account for 58 per cent of all expenditure in higher education (HESA, 1999),\nwith academic salaries accounting for 33 per cent, therefore it is crucial that the model\nincorporates realistic figures for staff time. The model assumes that institutions can\nproduce reasonable estimates based on category costs (for example, lecturer, senior\nlecturer). Rumble (1997) discusses the difficulties associated with this approach.\nCapital costs refer to items of non-recurrent expenditure that are written off over an\nexpected useful lifespan. The model proposes that capital costs include time spent on initial\ncourse or software development. The actual number of years over which capital costs are\nwritten off would depend on the factors that make reinvestment necessary (such as changes\nin technology or in course content) and on accounting conventions (for example,\namortization).\nRevenue costs in this model are defined as non-capitalized expenditure occurring in\nacademic departments or for IT support activities. Having identified staff, capital and\nrevenue costs, all other institutional costs (for example, utilities) are dealt with in much less\ndetail and are apportioned as overheads.\nCommentary\nIn contrast to true ABC, which assumes an institution's financial ledger would be re-\nanalysed to extract precise costing information, the model here advocates that the figures\nfor costs are sourced from much higher-level documentation (such as departmental\nestimates of staff time spent on specific activities, annual budgets and forecasts, planning\ndocuments, expenditure summaries). This methodology facilitates a quicker analysis of\nexpenditure but places a higher burden on the user of the model (than the mechanistic\nABC approach) to identify all the relevant expenditure.\nThe degree of accuracy that is lost in taking a high-level approach to costing in the model\nis justifiable for at least two reasons. First, it reduces the costs of conducting the costing\nexercise. Second, the effort spent in collecting detailed costs is negated when these figures\nare subsequently combined with the more subjective qualitative benefits information in\norder to derive cost-benefit relationships.\n\u2014\nDavid Nicol and Michael Coen A model for evaluating the institutional costs and benefits of ICT initiatives\nFramework for the evaluation of benefits\nClassifying benefits\nInitial work suggested that three broad categories of benefits would need to be considered -\neducational, organizational and external benefits. This categorization, as shown in Figure 1,\nrecognizes that most institutions seek to deliver the best education that they can (educational\nobjectives), to be effectively and efficiently organized and managed (organizational object-\nives) and to have a high standing within their external communities and within society\n(external objectives). These benefit categories would obviously overlap and interrelate in\nvarious ways in relation to a specific activity: for example, an ICT initiative in teaching might\nnot just incur educational benefits for students but might also improve information flow\nwithin the organization or improve the standing of the institution with a particular external\ncommunity. Tables 1, 2 and 3 illustrate a range of benefits within the three categories:\neducational, organizational and external and their associated evaluation methods.\nBenefit type Example evaluation methods\nStudent satisfaction\/motivation\nEnhanced quality of student learning\nImproved access to learning resources\nReusability of learning resources\nQuestionnaires and surveys\nFocus groups\nRetention rates\nConfidence in learning logs\nTest and examination results\nExternal examiners' reports\nDepartmental reviews\nTeaching quality assessment reports\nSurvey\nLog-in information\nCourse planning documents\nTeachers' reports\nStudent surveys of use\nTable I: Educational benefits and example evaluation methods\nBenefit type Example evaluation methods\nIncreased staff satisfaction\/motivation\nDevelopment of staff skills (e.g. IT)\nImprovements in organizational efficiency\nInnovation\nSurveys\nStaff turnover rates\nAppraisal data\n'Investors in People1 indicators\nAppraisal data\n'Investors in People' indicators\nInformation flow indicators\nSavings in staff time\nImprovements in service provision .\nComparisons with other HE institutions\nValue of research contracts secured\nResearch publications on ICT-supported learning\nTable 2: Organizational benefits and example evaluation methods\n52\nALT-] Volume 11 Number 2\nBenefit type Example evaluation methods\nEnhanced public profile of the institution \u2022 Number of hits on relevant websites\n\u2022 Newspaper reports\n\u2022 Recruitment rates\n\u2022 Number or quality of applications for courses\n\u2022 Professional bodies ratings\n\u2022 Teaching quality assessment reports\nStrategic partnering with external\norganizations (e.g. other HE institutions,\ncommercial or community organizations) \u2022 Formal and informal agreements\n\u2022 Surveys\nIncreased wealth creation \u2022 New revenue sources\/markets\nTable 3: External benefits and example evaluation methods\nWeighting and rating benefits\nIn applying the model, an institution would weight the selected benefits in a systematic\nway, in relation to its strategic objectives. For example, an institution with strategic\nmotivations that emphasize community involvement might initially weight criteria such as\n'strategic partnering' more highly than, say, 'student satisfaction'. This is consistent with\nthe HEFCE (1999) paper, Appraising Investment Decisions, which makes the following\nobservations:\nThe institution must first decide what criteria [benefits] are significant and how to score\nthem; scores can be weighted to reflect their relative importance. The results are only an\naid to decision making, and can never relate to any absolute measure. However, even if\nthe scores and weightings are fundamentally subjective, the institution will be in a better\nposition to explain the rationale for its decision.\nCommentary\nThe three broad benefits categories are provisional at this stage but they do provide a\nstarting point for benefits analysis within a framework that is reasonably broad in scope.\nThe results of a case study of cost-benefits of online delivery conducted by Oliver et al.\n(1999) would suggest that the types of benefits we proposed are realistic. It is assumed that\nthe actual benefit criteria would be chosen by the users of the model and would differ\ndepending on the HE institution and its strategic objectives. Furthermore, the benefits\ncould in practice be more broadly or narrowly defined. For example, instead of\n'improvements in organizational efficiency' one might focus more narrowly on 'effort\nneeded to keep information about students up to date'.\nThe INSIGHT cost-benefit model\nSimply identifying costs and benefits does not allow a comparison of ICT investments; to\nachieve this, an evaluation methodology is required. In this section the six steps of the\nINSIGHT cost-benefit model will be outlined and illustrated using a hypothetical example.\n53\nDavid Nicol and Michael Coen A model for evaluating the institutional costs and benefits of ICT initiatives\nStep I: identify the scope of the activities for each option to be included in the\ncosting\nThe INSIGHT model is based on 'option appraisal' techniques, where several competing\noptions are evaluated and a relative, as opposed to an absolute, assessment of their value is\nmade.\nIn our example, a fictitious institution, 'Kelvinglen University', wishes to evaluate the costs\nand benefits of three classes that utilize ICT in different ways, in order to determine which\nmodel should receive further strategic investment. A fourth class uses traditional teaching\nmethods and is included as a baseline comparison.

Kelvinglen University has a strategy that, among other things, emphasizes\nbalancing innovative use of ICT with high student satisfaction and on developing a high\npublic profile in ICT. Hence student satisfaction, innovation and public perception are\ngiven the highest weightings on a scale of 1-10. It should be noted here that the number of\ncriteria to be used in the model is not fixed and decision-makers can determine the number\nthat works best for their institution. However, we believe that in practice it will be best to\nagree on 3 to7 key criteria, those that matter most to the institution.\n54\nALT-J Volume 11 Number 2\nBenefit type Weighting (in scale of 1-10)\nStudent satisfaction 8\nLearning quality 7\nIncreased staff satisfaction 5\nInnovation 9\nPublic perception of the institution 8\nTable 5: Benefits sought after by the University ofKeivingien and the weightings of these benefits\nbased on the institution's strategic priorities\nStep 4: evaluate the options using the weighted criteria\nFor each of the chosen evaluation criteria the users of the model must decide on an\nappropriate evaluation methodology. The model is not prescriptive about what\nmethodology should be used. However, in the interests of comparability the same criteria\nshould be applied across each option. For example, Kelvinglen University has decided to\nuse the results of a comprehensive student survey to inform the evaluation of 'student\nsatisfaction'. For 'staff satisfaction', survey data exists for only two of the options and\ntherefore the evaluation group have decided to judge this criterion on the basis of\nanecdotal evidence. No quantitative evidence exists to inform the evaluation of 'public\nperception' criterion, so the group relies on judgements of an 'expert witness' - the\ninstitution's press officer.\nFor each option the results of these evaluations are translated into a rating on a 1-10 scale.\nThe rating for each evaluation criterion is multiplied by the weighting for that criterion to\narrive at a weighted score. The sum of these weighted scores represents a 'measure of\nbenefits' for each option or class (see Table 6).\nBenefit type\nStudent satisfaction\nLearning quality\nIncreased staff\nsatisfaction\nInnovation\nPublic perception\nof the institution\nMeasure of benefits\nInstitutional\npriorities:\nweighted\ncriteria (1-10)\nAll classes\n8\n7\n5\n9\n8\nEvaluation\n101\n9\n7\n9\n6\n8\n102\n9\n3\n4\n6\n2\nscore\n103\n9\n9\n7\n5\n4\n(1-10)\n104\n5\n5\n3\n3\n4\nFinal\n101\n72\n49\n45\n54\n64\n284\nweighted score (1-100)\n102\n72\n21\n20\n54\n16\n183\n103\n72\n63\n35\n45\n32\n247\n104\n40\n35\n15\n27\n32\n149\nTable 6: Measure of benefits for each class\/option (sum of the weighted scores)\n55\nDavid Nicol and Michael Coen A model for evaluating the institutional costs and benefits of ICT initiatives\nStep 5: determine the total cost-benefit ratio for each option\nHaving determined the cost and the benefits of each option (class) these can be compared\nto provide a relative assessment. The simplest method of doing this is to divide the benefits\nmeasures by the annual costs to produce a cost-benefit ratio (see Table 7).\nClass Annual cost (\u00a3 K) Benefits Cost-benefit ratio\nClass 101 -Laptop\nClass 102-VLE\nClass 103-PRS\nClass 104-Traditional\n148.8\n132.0\n100.4\n74.8\n284\n183\n247\n149\n1.90\n1.39\n2.46\n1.99\nTable 7: The cost-benefit ratio for each option (benefits divided by annual costs)\nStep 6: plot the results graphically and discuss their meaning\nThese results can plotted on a graph (Figure 2), with the 'Expected Benefits' line showing\nan average level of benefit that one might expect to accrue per \u00a3 of investment. Options\nabove and to the left of this line give a better than average effective return per \u00a3 of cost,\nwhereas options to the right and below the line give a poorer than average return.\nPotentially, if enough data were accumulated about existing and proposed services, this\n'Expected Benefits' ratio could be used to judge the value of any ICT project in isolation.\nOn examining Figure 2, Kelvinglen University might choose to invest in Class 103 as this\ngives the best return on investment. If no financial constraints existed, then Class 101\noffers the highest overall benefits rating in terms of the criteria. Class 104 is the least\n\u00a3D \u00a320. \u00a3<TJ \u00a36D \u00a3EO \u00a31DD \u00a3120 \u00a3 U 0 \u00a31S0\n4 NetGoft\n- * \u2014 Expected HsieTlt\nFigure 2: The relationship between the costs and benefits of each option\n56\nALT-] Volume 11 Number 2\neffective (measured against the institution's objectives) but it is also the cheapest, giving it a\nreasonable cost-benefit analysis. These results, however, cannot be taken at face value and\nwould have to be explored by those charged with making investment decisions.\nThe INSIGHT model as a decision support tool\nThe hypothetical example of a cost-benefit analysis outlined in this paper described the\nprocedures in somewhat mechanical terms. However, the real value of the model is in the\nway that it would be utilized by decision-makers. It is envisaged that decision-makers\nwould be involved, at an early stage, in proposing both the costing and benefits categories\nas well as the benefits weightings. This means that there is considerable flexibility in the\nway that the model might be constructed. Indeed, it could be argued that users actually\nbuild their own decision-making model tailored to their own institutional context.\nResearch on 'toolkits' in other decision-making domains (for example, course design) has\ndemonstrated that this kind of model-building process has significant benefits (Conole and\nOliver, 2002). It helps users to 'reflect upon and structure their thought processes' while\nmaking decisions in areas of professional practice.\nIt is also assumed that decision-makers would be involved in discussions after cost-benefit\nfigures are produced. It is inconceivable that a decision-making group would make\ninvestment choices based on a single calculation. The group would invariably wish to\nexplore the cost-benefit results that derive from different strategic priorities. This would\nrequire examining the effects of changes in benefits weightings and in ratings. So, while the\nmodel produces quantitative outputs it is assumed that these figures are provisional and\nthat they merely act as triggers for debate and discussion. A final point to note here is that\nalthough we have described the model from the strategic perspective of an HE institution,\nthe model could just as easily be constructed in relation to other organizational levels (such\nas faculty or department).\nIssues to be addressed in future developments\nThe cost-benefit model outlined in this paper is currently being piloted across six HE\ninstitutions. However, conceptual testing has already helped us identify a number of issues\nthat must be addressed as the model is developed.\nScope versus depth of impact\nIn the Kelvinglen example, it was assumed that the numbers of students participating in\neach class were broadly similar. However, if the numbers had differed significantly a\nquestion arises: 'is it better to implement an ICT project that has a small impact on large\nnumbers of people or that has a big impact on a smaller group'. For example, if the cost-\nbenefit ratios were the same, would it be better to invest in a communications\ninfrastructure that has a small effect in supporting teaching and learning across the whole\ninstitution or to invest in a highly developed system in one faculty. This emphasizes the\nimportance of dialogue and of weighting objectives closely to strategic priorities.\nTiming of cost-benefit analyses\nA second issue concerns the timing of cost-benefit analyses. The Kelvinglen example\nassumed that the options appraisal was carried out after implementation. The advantages\n57\nDavid Nicol and Michael Coen A model for evaluating the institutional costs and benefits of ICT initiatives\nof retrospective appraisal are that it is possible to collect harder evidence of costs and\nbenefits. If the appraisal were carried out prior to the start of a new initiative (for example,\nto obtain funding) then the costs-benefits data in the model would necessarily be\nprovisional and more subjective. Nonetheless, new initiatives are normally run as pilots\nand hence increased subjectivity at this stage would normally be expected. Another\nconcern is that the costs and benefits deriving from the first run of a new initiative might be\nquite different from those that occur when the change has become embedded into\noperational procedures. While the costing model suggests gradually writing off the initial\nstart-up costs (amortizing) over an extended time-span this has not been shown in the\nexample and no corresponding adjustment has been suggested for benefits.\nDeriving evaluation data that can be used for ICT project comparisons\nA third issue concerns the difficulty of obtaining measures of benefits that would allow\ncomparison across different ICT projects. As the Kelvinglen example shows, there is no\nsimple solution to this problem and especially when one might be comparing investment\nscenarios that produce quite different benefits. However, in practice, with a small number\nof criteria (aligned to strategic objectives), evaluators should be able to rank order the\nbenefits of different projects in relation to these criteria. Moreover, benefits evaluation\ndata could be made more systematic and comparable. This could be done by employing an\nindependent evaluator to scrutinize the findings of the evaluation reports from different\nICT projects, by ensuring that each project is evaluated across a common set of criteria,\nand by having different project evaluators discuss their findings as a group before making\nrecommendations to the decision-making body.\nConclusion\nThe cost-benefit model described in this paper was devised to help decision-makers\nevaluate choices regarding ICT investments in teaching and learning. Key features of the\nmodel are that it can be adapted to quite different organizational, financial and ICT\nstructures; that it concentrates on high-level costs; that it takes an institution-wide\nperspective on benefits; and that it focuses decision-making on a small number of strategic\npriorities, those that matter most to the institution. Finally, the model is a work in progress\nand we welcome feedback from readers to help us refine our thinking.\nNote\nAn earlier report on the INSIGHT project that was submitted to JISC which includes a\nsoftware model can be found at: http:\/\/www.mis.strath.ac.uk\/predict\/projects\/insight\/\nindex.htm.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank Professor George Gordon, Nigel Kay and Caroline\nBreslin of the University of Strathclyde and Anne Hughes of Joint Information Systems\nCommittee (JISC) of the UK for their assistance in the development of this paper.\n58\nALT-J Volume I I Number 2\nReferences\nAnderson, C., Day, K., Haywood, D., Heywood, J., Land, R and Macleod, H.
