As\na result, dual-chamber pacing, as compared with\nsingle-chamber ventricular pacing, improves he-\nmodynamic function,\n \n2-4\n \n but the clinical benefit is\nuncertain.\nNonrandomized studies suggest that dual-\nchamber pacing is associated with a lower incidence\nof atrial fibrillation, stroke, and heart failure than\nis single-chamber pacing.\n \n5\n \n There is also evidence\nof improved survival, but the data are confounded\nby selection bias, because of the preferential use of\ndual-chamber pacing in younger patients with few-\ner coexisting illnesses.\n \n6\n \n Some current guidelines\nrecommend dual-chamber pacing unless atrial fi-\nbrillation is present,\n \n7\n \n but the limitations of the sup-\nporting data have led to questions about the guide-\nlines\n \n8\n \n and the apparent underuse of dual-chamber\npacing, particularly in the elderly.\n \n9,10\n \nThe United Kingdom Pacing and Cardiovascu-\nlar Events (UKPACE) trial compared the clinical\nbenefits of single-chamber ventricular pacing and\ndual-chamber pacing in elderly patients with atrio-\nventricular block.\n \n10\n \nThe UKPACE trial was a randomized, parallel-group\ntrial conducted in 46 centers in the United Kingdom,\nrepresenting a wide range of experience among\ncenters and operators. The trial was approved by\nthe North West Multi-Centre Research Ethics Com-\nmittee and the local research ethics committee for\neach center. All patients provided written informed\nconsent.\n \npatient selection\n \nPatients were recruited from August 22, 1995, to\nSeptember 24, 1999. All new pacemaker implan-\ntations were registered, and trial eligibility was re-\ncorded. Eligible patients were 70 years of age or\nolder and scheduled for their first pacemaker im-\nplantations for high-grade (i.e., second-degree or\ncomplete) atrioventricular block. Exclusion crite-\nria included chronic established atrial fibrillation,\nNew York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV heart\nfailure, advanced cognitive dysfunction, total im-\nmobility, and advanced cancer (life expectancy of\nless than one year). Patients with persistent atrial\nfibrillation of less than three months\u2019 duration were\neligible if they had undergone cardioversion and\nhad normal sinus rhythm at enrollment.\n \ndata collection, randomization, \nimplantation, and programming\n \nBaseline demographic and clinical characteris-\ntics of the patients were recorded by physicians,\nnurses, or cardiac technicians. Patients were ran-\ndomly assigned, up to 24 hours before the sched-\nuled implantation, to receive either a fixed-rate or\nrate-adaptive single-chamber ventricular pacing\nsystem or a dual-chamber system (with or without\nsensor-modulated rate adaptation). Within the sin-\ngle-chamber group, assignment to fixed-rate or rate-\nadaptive pacing was randomly determined. Ran-\ndomization was performed with the use of a 24-hour\nautomated telephone-based system, linked to a com-\nputer at the data center, with a dynamic balancing\nalgorithm that stratified patients by center and age\n(<80 years or \u226580 years). Implantation was per-\nformed according to the operator\u2019s usual practice.\nThe use of sensor-based rate adaptation in the\ndual-chamber group and the programming of var-\niables other than mode were determined by the in-\nvestigator. Suggested settings for dual-chamber\npacemakers were an atrioventricular delay of 150\nmsec, rate-adaptive atrioventricular shortening\nto 75 msec, and lower and upper rate limits of 60\nbeats per minute and 125 beats per minute, respec-\ntively. For rate-adaptive single-chamber pacemak-\ners, the suggested lower and upper rate limits were\n70 beats per minute and 125 beats per minute, re-\nspectively. For fixed-rate single-chamber pacemak-\ners, a rate of 70 beats per minute was suggested.\nThe operators and patients were not blinded to the\ntype of pacing system used or the programming of\nthe system.\n \nend point and outcomes\n \nThe primary end point was death from all causes.\nPrespecified cardiovascular events included atrial\nfibrillation (defined as an episode, with or with-\nout symptoms, lasting 15 minutes or more and veri-\nfied by electrocardiography), new or significantly\nworsening heart failure, a composite of stroke, tran-\nsient ischemic attack, or other thromboembolism,\nrevision of the pacing system, new-onset angina\nc\nmethods\nThe New England Journal of Medicine \nDownloaded from nejm.org at UNIVERSITY OF LEICESTER on December 4, 2015.

Crossover, in the event of sus-\npected intolerance of the pacing mode, was at the\ndiscretion of the investigator.\nPatients were followed for a minimum of 3 years,\nwith scheduled visits at 1, 4, 10, 16, and 36 months,\nat which the pacemaker function was assessed and\noutcome events were recorded. Patients were giv-\nen a diary in which the details of any medical con-\ntacts between their follow-up visits were to be re-\ncorded. The identity of enrolled patients was given\nto the U.K. Office for National Statistics, which pro-\nvided automatic notification of registered deaths.\nMortality data were censored on September 24,\n2002. Data for other cardiovascular events were\ncensored at the actual or intended date of the 36-\nmonth visit. If the visit was missed, outcome data\nwere sought through a review of clinical records or\nthrough contact with the patient\u2019s family doctor.\nDeaths and specified cardiovascular events were\nadjudicated and classified by an independent com-\nmittee on end points and events, with members un-\naware of the pacing modes. Deaths were classified\nas due to cardiovascular or noncardiovascular caus-\nes and treated as the result of cardiovascular causes\nif attributed to old age or if the cause was unclear.\nSafety was monitored by an independent data-mon-\nitoring committee.\n \nstatistical analysis\n \nThe database was maintained and analyzed by an\nindependent data-management group (Notting-\nham Clinical Research Group, Nottingham, Unit-\ned Kingdom). The trial was designed to have a\npower of at least 90 percent to detect a 25 percent\nreduction in the primary end point, with a target re-\ncruitment of 2000 patients. This assumed an an-\nnual mortality rate of 8 percent in the single-cham-\nber group, with allowance for a 6 percent crossover\nfrom single-chamber to dual-chamber pacing. More\ndeaths were reported than anticipated, giving the\nstudy 95 percent power to detect a 25 percent re-\nduction in mortality.\nDifferences in the proportion of ventricular\nbeats that were paced were compared with the use\nof the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Cumulative-event\nrates were calculated according to the Kaplan\u2013Mei-\ner method,\n \n11\n \n and differences between the groups\nwere assessed with the use of the Cox proportional-\nhazards model,\n \n12\n \n with adjustment for the baseline\ncovariates of age (\u226480 years vs. >80 years), sex, and\nNYHA class (I or II vs. III or IV). Relative risk was\ncalculated after adjustment for age, sex, and NYHA\nclass at baseline and expressed as hazard ratios with\n95 percent confidence intervals. The primary analy-\nsis was the comparison of single-chamber and dual-\nchamber pacing. A prespecified secondary analysis\ninvolved the separate comparisons of fixed-rate and\nrate-adaptive single-chamber pacing with dual-\nchamber pacing. The impact of baseline covariates\non the hazard ratio for the primary end point was\nassessed with the use of the log-rank test.\n \n13\n \n The\nincidence of procedural and predischarge compli-\ncations in the two groups was compared with the\nuse of the chi-square test. All statistical tests were\ntwo-tailed. Analysis was performed on the basis\nof the intention-to-treat principle.\nThe study was designed by Drs. Toff, Skehan, and\nCamm and David de Bono in collaboration with the\ntrial steering committee and other participating in-\nvestigators (see the Appendix) and funded by the\nMedical Research Council of the United Kingdom.\nPacemakers were purchased according to normal\npractice, but in centers that had previously implant-\ned less than 50 percent dual-chamber pacing sys-\ntems, additional hardware costs were met by a sub-\nsidy from pacemaker manufacturers and suppliers\nunder the terms of an agreement with the Interna-\ntional Association of Prosthesis Manufacturers.\nNo pacemaker manufacturer or supplier had any\ninvolvement in the study design, data collection,\nanalysis of results, or writing of the manuscript. The\nmanuscript was written by the principal investiga-\ntors and the first draft reviewed by the trial steering\ncommittee and other participating investigators.\n \nscreening\n \nDuring the recruitment period, 16,375 patients re-\nceived a first pacemaker implantation at the par-\nticipating centers. Of these, 5308 (32.4 percent) had\nhigh-grade atrioventricular block and were 70 years\nof age or more. Exclusion criteria were documented\nin 945 patients, leaving 4363 eligible for the study,\nof whom 1972 (45.2 percent) were enrolled. The re-\nmaining patients were excluded because the patient\ndeclined to participate (13.2 percent), because the\nphysician declined (15.0 percent), or for other or un-\nstated reasons (26.6 percent). Forty-nine patients\nwho were enrolled were not included in the registry\neither because they did not receive a pacemaker or\nbecause registry data were missing for the rele-\nvant period.\nresults\nThe New England Journal of Medicine \nDownloaded from nejm.org at UNIVERSITY OF LEICESTER on December 4, 2015.

The differences in com-\nplication rates were principally due to problems\nwith the placement or stability of atrial leads.\nThe key finding from this randomized trial was\nthat in elderly patients with high-grade atrioven-\ntricular block, dual-chamber pacing provided no\nsurvival advantage over single-chamber pacing.\nThis result contrasts with the findings of nonran-\ndomized studies that suggested there was im-\nproved survival with dual-chamber pacing, which\nprobably reflected selection bias.\n \n6,14\n \nOur trial focused on atrioventricular block in\nthe elderly, but the absence of a survival advantage\nfor dual-chamber pacing is consistent with the re-\nsults of other trials that included younger patients\nand those with sinus-node disease. In the Pace-\nmaker Selection in the Elderly (PASE) study, 407\npatients 65 years of age or older with sinus-node\ndisease or atrioventricular block were randomly as-\nsigned to receive single-chamber ventricular pac-\ning or dual-chamber pacing.\n \n15\n \n The study was not\npowered to assess mortality, but there was no sig-\nnificant difference in survival or clinical outcomes\nduring the mean follow-up period of 18 months,\nalthough the crossover rate from ventricular to\ndual-chamber pacing was high (26 percent).\nIn the Canadian Trial of Physiologic Pacing\n(CTOPP), 2568 patients 18 years of age or older who\nhad sinus-node disease or atrioventricular block\nwere randomly assigned to physiologic (atrial or\ndual-chamber) pacing or single-chamber ventricu-\nlar pacing.\n \n16\n \n During the mean follow-up period of\nthree years, there was no significant difference in\nthe rate of death from all causes or in the primary\nend point of cardiovascular death or stroke. There\nwas an 18 percent reduction in the relative risk of\natrial fibrillation with dual-chamber pacing but no\nsignificant difference in the rate of hospitalization\nfor heart failure or in the occurrence of stroke. Fol-\nlow-up extended to a mean of 6.4 years showed a\nfurther reduction in the relative risk of atrial fibril-\nlation (20.1 percent) but no other benefit from\nphysiological pacing.\n \n17\n \nThe absence of a reduction in atrial fibrillation\nwith dual-chamber pacing in the UKPACE trial\ncontrasts with the findings of the CTOPP trial. This\ndifference may reflect the older age of our patients,\nin whom any propensity toward atrial fibrillation\ndiscussion\n \nFigure 2.

It is possible\nthat with longer follow-up of our patients, a differ-\nence might also emerge among them.\nAn interesting feature in our study was the in-\ncreased early incidence of atrial fibrillation in the\ndual-chamber group. It is possible that the atrial\nlead may be arrhythmogenic in the early months\nafter implantation. Alternatively, the capacity of\ndual-chamber pacemakers to detect high-rate atri-\nal episodes might have led to an earlier recognition\nof atrial fibrillation. This capability might also in-\ncrease the overall likelihood that atrial fibrillation\nwill be detected with these systems, potentially\nmasking a benefit of dual-chamber pacing; how-\never, the diagnostic requirement of an electrocar-\ndiographically verified episode lasting 15 minutes\nor longer would be expected to attenuate the effect\nof such a bias.\nThe finding that there was a higher rate of\nstroke, transient ischemic attack, or thromboem-\nbolism with fixed-rate ventricular pacing is intrigu-\ning. Conceivably, the lower heart rates associated\nwith fixed-rate pacing might promote atrial stasis,\nbut the finding could be due to the play of chance\namid multiple comparisons and should be inter-\npreted with caution. The observation may, howev-\ner, favor the use of a rate-adaptive system if a sin-\ngle-chamber ventricular pacemaker is used.\nOur results, supported by the PASE and CTOPP\ntrials, suggest that the clinical benefits associated\nwith dual-chamber pacing for atrioventricular block\nhave been overestimated. It is perhaps counterin-\ntuitive that the hemodynamic advantages of atrio-\nventricular synchrony do not result in greater clini-\ncal benefit. One explanation for this may be that\nintraventricular and interventricular dyssynchrony\nresulting from stimulation at the right ventricular\napex might counteract the benefit of atrioventricu-\nlar synchrony.\n \n19,20\n \n This effect might be accentuat-\ned by the higher proportion of paced ventricular\nbeats in the dual-chamber group. It is possible that\nalternative strategies, such as biventricular or sep-\ntal pacing, might improve hemodynamic function\nand clinical outcomes. This hypothesis requires\ntesting in clinical trials.\nThe low crossover rate (3.1 percent) from sin-\ngle-chamber to dual-chamber pacing in our study\nwas similar to that in the CTOPP trial (2.7 percent),\nsuggesting that single-chamber pacing is well tol-\nerated. The higher crossover rate in the PASE study\n(26 percent), in which randomization to mode of\npacing was made by software programming rather\nthan by assignment of hardware, may reflect varia-\ntion in the incidence of pacemaker syndrome but\nalso highlights the subjective element in the diag-\nnosis of this syndrome.\nThe choice of pacing mode for elderly patients\nwith high-grade atrioventricular block should be\nmade on an individual basis. Over three years, dual-\nchamber pacing is unlikely to influence mortality\nor the incidence of cardiovascular events, and sin-\ngle-chamber ventricular pacing should be regard-\ned as an acceptable mode. The occasional need to\nupgrade to dual-chamber systems because of pac-\ning-mode intolerance must be weighed against the\nincreased risk of complications with dual-chamber\nimplants. In elderly patients, factors other than the\nmode of pacing are more likely to determine the\nclinical outcome.\nIn elderly patients with high-grade atrioven-\ntricular block, the mode of pacing has no signifi-\ncant influence on the rate of death from all causes\nin the first five years after pacemaker implantation.\nFixed-rate single-chamber ventricular pacing is\nassociated with an increased risk of stroke, tran-\nsient ischemic attack, or thromboembolism, but\nthe pacing mode does not otherwise influence the\nincidence of cardiovascular events in the first three\nyears after pacemaker implantation.\n \nSupported by a grant from the Medical Research Council of the\nUnited Kingdom (G9403190).
