It is one of the best examples of its kind I have seen. Its\nimpressive features include hi-fi surround sound, an enormous back-projected screen giving\nsuperb picture quality from either a VCR or directly from a computer for live demonstrations,\nonline facilities, the latest remote-control slide-projection equipment, complete lecturer's\ncontrol panel, and several nice touches such as automatic dimming of the auditorium lights\nwhen Play is pressed on any of the hidden video playback machines. The overhead projectors\nand their screens are of the best quality and correctly positioned for the clearest possible\ndisplay. There are also video-link facilities for spill-over into a secondary lecture theatre\nwhich itself is well fitted out in presentational equipment.\nClearly, this set-up involved major expenditure. It was therefore presumably discussed at\ngreat length before the decision concerning such a long-term commitment was taken. But a\ncommitment to what? To the use of technology in education, obviously, but also to the notion\nof the stand-up-and-deliver lecture. Typically, computer-assisted instruction involves a single\nstudent or small group of students sitting in front of a monitor, interacting with some software\nand self-pacing their learning. The traditional lecture represents the very opposite of this\napproach: large numbers of students taking notes, with interaction being at best limited and at\nworst non-existent, and with the pace of proceedings depending almost entirely on the\nlecturer's judgement.\nNow, I am involved in a shared final-year course in my own university which attracts large\nnumbers of students and for which the traditional weekly lecture is the main communication\nmedium, and I have just attended a staff-student committee meeting at which some criticism\nof this course was voiced by students taking it. It was not that these students complained of\nthe course being taught in a less than innovative way, but rather that they were being asked to\ndo too much on their own outside class hours, in particular studying secondary topics which\ncannot be covered in only 25 or so lectures plus some tutorials. In my long experience,\nuniversity lecturers have always grumbled that students wish to be spoon-fed. But even taking\ninto account any rose-coloured view of the past I may have, I would say that the situation has,\nif anything, worsened over the past decade or so.\nThese days, we might tend to put the problem - accepting that for some teachers in some\ndisciplines, it may not actually be a problem - in terms of students preferring passivity to\ninteractivity, or at least we might extend the problem to those terms. For this reason, I am a\nlittle sceptical - when it comes to the practice - about the claimed benefits of courses offering\nthe possibility of experiential and discovery-based learning in higher education. It almost goes\nwithout saying that the intentions are good, but the practice, if it is not precisely the streets of\nHell, is paved with obstacles, not the least of which is a widespread desire among university\nstudents to have files full of lecture notes. Having lots of neatly filed-away information\nappears to be satisfying in itself, such that learning can be postponed with a clear conscience\nuntil the time comes for revision. And this is true not only in subject-areas where large\namounts of factual information have to be delivered. For instance, it is equally true of\ntranslation courses in modern languages, where fair copies of translations may be given out by\na teacher, to be filed away by the students for future reference, whatever that teacher's\n2\nAa-J VOLUME 2 NUMBER 1\nexhortations that such fair copies should form the basis of a regular review of errors, in the\nstudents' own time, so that learning is continually maximised. It is equally true of certain\nscience, social-science and philosophical disciplines where the understanding of concepts\noutweighs factual knowledge, and where notes about a lecturer's view of a multi-sided\nproblem may not be thought about but rather, simply, filed for later consideration as the\nexamination approaches.\nAll this, of course, is part of the traditional criticism of the traditional lecture, but the advent\nof usable educational technology has made the issue even more poignant Not all educational\ntechnology is in a primitive stage of development. We have with us, here and now, many tools\nwhich allow genuine self-paced exploratory learning at a high level, without those almost\ninsurmountable barriers of a computer program crashing, or occasionally being made to look\ninadequate (or plain stupid). Why, then, does educational technology have to be promoted so\nvigorously by those who believe in its advantages? Indeed, why does ALT need to exist? Why\nnot simply an association for learning? After all, there exists no association, as far as I am\naware, for the promotion of good practice in word-processing, or sending faxes, or using the\ntelephone.\nTwo answers to such questions are often given. The first is that educational technology\ninvolves considerable financial investment, so that those who decide on how much to spend\non what, need to be convinced of its cost-effectiveness. The second is that many students are\ntechnophobes. As to the former - the question of cost - it is plainly true that decision-makers\nwithin higher education have to be persuaded that educational technology involves a worth-\nwhile return, both financial and pedagogical. But that argument, taken on its own, can be\neasily won, and once it has been won, what seemed at first impossible in terms of commit-\nment to spending - even in times of cash shortage - can actually be achieved. There is also\nclearly some truth in the existence of student technophobia, but again this can be overcome,\nand is being overcome in many disciplines in many institutions.\nNo, in my view, the most fundamental obstacle to the acceptance of student-centred learning,\nwith or without the use of technology, is student attitudes to university courses. I would not\nclaim that this is true in all subject-areas in all universities, but I have my own experience to\ndraw on, as well as that of colleagues both in my own institution and many other institutions.\nThe experience of many teachers who have tried educational software is that student reaction\nis favourable - indeed, we have seen that direction clearly emerging in certain contributions to\nthis journal. This must give us cause for optimism. There remains nevertheless the ominous\npresence of the satisfying, if dusty, file of lecture notes. In a word, somehow we have to\nchange student attitudes to learning, and that is the major challenge, a far greater one than\nchanging the attitudes of students and financial decision-makers to technology.\nIf we succeed in changing such attitudes to learning, what of the traditional lecture? It seems\nto me that Leeds Metropolitan University will have got it right on this score provided that the\nnew lecture facilities are accompanied by other technological facilities for small-group\nlearning. But, whatever other facilities are available, the high-technology lecture theatre will\nin any event have its rightful place. If used well - and really good facilities tend to generate\ntheir own use (while poor, or even merely adequate, facilities result in technological hardware\ngathering dust) - it allows.for brighter lectures. And since the real purpose of a lecture is to\nstimulate thought and further study rather than being merely a method of communicating\ninformation, having the technological means of making a lecture more interesting, and hence\nmore thought-provoking, can only enhance the learning process.\nGabriel Jacobs\n3\n"}
