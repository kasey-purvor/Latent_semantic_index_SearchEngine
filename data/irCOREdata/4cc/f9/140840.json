Introduction 6 \nRemoval of phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) from wastewater effluents is important to ensure 7 \nenvironmental protection of surface waters. High concentrations of nutrients in rivers have been 8 \nrelated to eutrophication [1]. Biological nutrient removal (BNR) processes are widely used to 9 \nremove nutrients from wastewater, however for the phosphate accumulating organisms (PAO) and 10 \nheterotrophic denitrifiers to be able uptake P and reduce nitrate (NO\n-\n3) respectively, the wastewater 11 \nmust have sufficient carbon to favour their metabolism [2]. It has been reported that 6-10 mg of 12 \nvolatile fatty acids (VFAs) or 20 mg chemical oxygen demand (COD) as acetic acid are required to 13 \nremove 1 mg of phosphorus [2] and that 3-4 mg COD as acetic acid per 1 mg  of total nitrogen are 14 \nrequired for denitrification [3]. More recently, a study in a sequencing batch biofilm reactor 15 \ndemonstrated that 7 mg l\n-1\n of acetate are required to remove 1 mg P l\n-1\n [4]. To achieve the essential 16 \ncarbon to nutrient ratio, the wastewater can be supplemented with an industrial effluent rich in 17 \nsoluble carbon or chemicals such as ethanol, methanol or acetate to the wastewater. However, the 18 \ndependence of BNR over the existence of local industries or the costs associated with transport and 19 \nchemical storage facilities can be significant, decreasing the attractiveness of these external carbon 20 \nsources. Alternatively, a carbon source rich in VFAs, which are the most suitable carbon source for 21 \nBNR [5], can be produced at the sewage treatment works (STWs) by disintegration or fermentation 22 \nof sewage sludge. This approach can stimulate sludge re-use as an alternative to anaerobic digestion 23 \nand potentially improve BNR efficiency [6].  24 \n 25 \nPage 3 of 26\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n \n \n3 \nNevertheless, the question remains as to what sludge source to use and the appropriate mechanism 1 \nto apply for VFAs production. Fermentation of primary sludge can promote VFAs production [7, 8] 2 \nand this method is currently used in countries such as South Africa and the USA for internal carbon 3 \nsource production for BNR [9]. The sludge retention time in the fermenter is critical to achieve high 4 \nVFAs production in order to enhance hydrolysis and acidogenesis without methane gas formation. 5 \nHence, the sludge retention time must be lower than 6 to 10 days depending on the temperature 6 \n20\u00b0C to 10\u00b0C, respectively [10, 11]. Fermentation of secondary sludge has been described to be 7 \ncomplex due to the composition of the sludge, mainly microbial cells and flocs, which are difficult 8 \nto breakdown under anaerobic conditions [12-14]. Furthermore, VFAs-COD equivalent production 9 \nfrom SAS fermentation has been reported to be low with 21 mg g\n-1\n volatile suspended solids (VSS) 10 \ncompared with primary sludge fermentation 226 mg g\n-1\n VSS [15]. Alternatively the production of 11 \nan internal carbon source from secondary sludge can be achieved through mechanical 12 \ndisintegration. This has been demonstrated to increase the soluble chemical oxygen demand 13 \n(SCOD) and VFAs content by disrupting microbial flocs and cells using pressure and friction forces 14 \n[16, 17]. However, there is little information about the application of the disintegrated sludge to 15 \nBNR in order to improve P and N removal [18] and how it compares with primary sludge 16 \nfermentation. 17 \n 18 \nThe aim of this study was to compare fermented primary sludge and disintegrated SAS, both 19 \ncentrifuged supernatant and disintegrated sludge, for producing a carbon source suitable for BNR. 20 \nThe two methods were compared in terms of VFAs production rate, type of VFAs released and 21 \nSCOD release rates. Furthermore, the nutrient removal potential of the internal carbon sources was 22 \ndetermined by completing nutrient removal predictive tests and comparing removal rates with 23 \nacetate \u2013 an external carbon source. The implications of each of the technologies to the overall 24 \ntreatment process were also assessed in relation to the possible internal recycling of nutrients within 25 \nthe STW. 26 \nPage 4 of 26\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n \n \n4 \n2. Materials and methods  1 \n2.1 Mechanical disintegration of surplus activated sludge 2 \nFive litres of thickened surplus activated sludge (SAS) was collected from a 1 m\n3\n BNR pilot-plant 3 \nand mechanically disintegrated using a 10\u201d Pilao DTD Spider Deflaker with a 30 kW motor fitted 4 \nwith 230 mm discs with 3 active cell layers according to Kampas et al. [16]. The disintegration 5 \nprocess was conducted as a batch. A portion of the disintegrated sludge was centrifuged for 20 min 6 \nat 8804 g (Hettich Zentrifugen, Tuttlingen, Germany). The centrifuged supernatant and 7 \ndisintegrated sludge were used within hours after disintegration for nutrient removal predictive tests 8 \nand analysed for VFAs, SCOD, nitrate (NO3-N), ammonium (NH4\n+\n)  and PO4-P contents.    9 \n 10 \n2.2 Fermentation of primary sludge  11 \nPrimary sludge was collected from five full-scale STWs  (Yorkshire, UK) with population 12 \nequivalents (PE) of 499,065, 386,123, 373985, 373,985, 573,394 and 18,914 for Sites 1, 2, 3, 4 and 13 \n5, respectively. Four and half litres of primary sludge were fermented in 5 l vessels (quickfit flask 14 \n100 mm flange bore, height 290 mm QRE-130-B, Fisher, UK) for 4 days at room temperature (20-15 \n23\u00b0C).  The sludge was mechanically mixed at a constant speed of 0.7 g by overhead motor stirrers 16 \n(Heidolph RZR 2020 and 2102, Schwabach, Germany) with anaerobic conditions promoted by 17 \nsealing the fermentation vessels. Every 12h, 60 ml of sludge was sampled for VFAs analyses and 18 \nevery 24h for total suspended solids (TSS), SCOD, pH, NH4\n+\n and PO4-P analyses. All 19 \nfermentations were completed in duplicate. At the end of 80h, the fermentation product obtained 20 \nfrom the sludge collected at Site 1 was centrifuged for 20 min at 8804 g (Hettich Zentrifugen, 21 \nTuttlingen, Germany) and the supernatant stored frozen at -20\u00b0C for nutrient removal predictive 22 \ntests. This fermentation product was selected because it displayed high VFAs production from an 23 \ninitial concentration 2.2 g l\n-1\n to a final 6.3 g l\n-1\n (2.8 fold increase) and presented typical VFAs 24 \ncontents of fermented primary sludge with 44% acetic acid and 35% propionic acid [19]. 25 \nPage 5 of 26\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n \n \n5 \n2.3 Nutrient removal predictive tests  1 \nPhosphorus release and denitrification testes were conducted in 2.5 l plexi-glass vessels at 25\u00b0C 2 \naccording to method described by Kampas et al. [20]. A mixture of 1 l wastewater and 1 l returned 3 \nactivated sludge (RAS), collected from a full-scale BNR plant in Derbyshire, UK was placed in 4 \neach of the five vessels used for the nutrient removal predictive tests. Nitrogen gas was 5 \ncontinuously supplied to the headspace of the vessels to ensure anaerobic conditions. The vessels 6 \nwere mixed with magnetic stirrers at 20.2 g and the pH and dissolved oxygen continuously 7 \nmonitored with stable values at 7.2-7.5 and < 0.15 mg l\n-1\n, respectively. Vessel 1 was used as a 8 \ncontrol without a carbon source addition, vessel 2 was spiked with a solution of sodium acetate and 9 \nvessels 3, 4 and 5 were spiked with liquor obtained from the fermented primary sludge, 10 \nmechanically disintegrated SAS and supernatant from the SAS disintegration, respectively. This 11 \nexperimental configuration was used for a total of 4 different tests for phosphorus release and 12 \ndenitrification when the amount of carbon added to each vessel was matched in SCOD (50 mg l\n-1\n) 13 \nand total VFAs (3.5 mg l\n-1\n) contents (Table 1). 14 \n 15 \nFor the denitrification tests, 20 mg KNO3 l\n-1\n was added to each vessel at the beginning of the 16 \nexperiment to ensure sufficient nitrate in the wastewater. The tests were completed for 2 and 20h 17 \nfor the phosphorus release and denitrification tests, respectively. Samples of 60 ml were taken every 18 \n0.5h for the first 2h. The samples were analysed for VSS, SCOD, PO4-P and NO3-N. Phosphate 19 \nrelease and denitrification rates were calculated after 2h and 1.5h, respectively.  Replicates of the P 20 \nrelease and denitrification tests were not completed because the wastewater and RAS  needed to be 21 \nused within 1-2 hours after collection. Therefore the 4 series of experiments were completed in 22 \nbatches and results compared [20].  23 \n 24 \n 25 \n 26 \nPage 6 of 26\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n \n \n6 \n2.4 Analytical methods  1 \nThe samples were centrifuged at 8804 g for 20 min (Hettich Zentrifugen, Tuttlingen, Germany) 2 \nand the supernatant filtered through a 0.45 \u03bcm (glass-fiber filter paper) prior to analyses. Chemical 3 \noxygen demand, NO3-N, NH4\n+\n, PO4-P were determined using Merck Spectroquant cell test 4 \n(Darmstadt, Denmark) according to the manufacturer instructions. Solids determination, TSS and 5 \nVSS, was performed according to Standard Methods [21]. All the analyses were completed in 6 \nduplicate.  7 \n 8 \nFor VFAs determination, 9 ml of the filtrate was placed in 10 ml plastic tubes and acidified with 9 \n10 \u03bcl of sulphuric acid (98% purity) and frozen until high performance liquid chromatography 10 \n(HPLC) analyses was completed. The VFAs samples were analysed in triplicate using a HPLC 11 \n(Shimadzu VP Series, Shimadzu, Milton Keynes, UK) with the ultraviolet (UV) detector set at 12 \n208 nm. The columns Biorad (cat. 125-0115) (105 mm \u00d7 7.8 mm) and the guard column (Biorad 13 \ncat. 125-0131) were maintained at 65\u00b0C. The injection volume was 15 \u03bcl and each sample was run 14 \nfor 0.5h using 1 mM sulphuric acid pumped at a flow rate of 0.8 ml min\n-1\n. A mixture of VFAs 15 \n(acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid and valeric acid analytical grade) at concentrations 16 \nbetween 0.05 - 1 g l\n-1\n was used as internal standard.   17 \n 18 \n3. Results and discussion  19 \n3.1 Soluble COD and VFAs production   20 \nSoluble COD and VFAs concentrations of SAS increased to 3.6 g l\n-1 \nand 0.37 g l\n-1 \nafter mechanical 21 \ndisintegration by a deflaker corresponding to a 9 fold and 4.1 fold increases from initial values, 22 \nrespectively (Table 2). The primary sludge was fermented during 80h and after this period the 23 \nSCOD increased to a maximum value of 10.3 g l\n-1\n (Site 5) with an average SCOD increase of 2 fold 24 \nfor all sources of primary sludge fermented (Table 2). Likewise, the VFAs concentration increased 25 \nto an average value of 6.5 g l\n-1\n with the highest VFAs production observed for the sludge from Site 26 \nPage 7 of 26\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n \n \n7 \n5 with a final concentration of 8.7 g l\n-1\n. The maximum increase in VFAs was 2.5 fold from the 1 \ninitial concentration (Table 2).  2 \n 3 \n The VFAs and SCOD production yields from SAS disintegration were 6 g VFAs kg\n-1\n TSS and 62 g 4 \nSCOD kg\n -1\n TSS. In comparison, the yields from primary sludge fermentation were 81 g VFAs kg\n-1\n 5 \nTSS and 95 g SCOD kg\n -1\n TSS. The SCOD and VFAs yields indicate that primary sludge 6 \nfermentation promoted VFAs production while SAS disintegration mainly induced SCOD release. 7 \nFull-scale static primary sludge fermenter thickeners have yields of 25-40 g VFAs kg\n-1\n sludge after 8 \n2-3 days [9], which are in the same order of magnitude of the yields described here.  9 \n For all types of sludge fermented (Sites 1 to 5) and disintegrated SAS the production of VFAs was 10 \nfound to be linearly correlated with SCOD release (Fig. 1).  The correlation factors (R\n2\n) were 11 \ncalculated over the 80h fermentation period and the values recorded were between 0.99 (Site 2) and 12 \n0.86 (Site 5) and therefore can be considered linearly correlated.  Hence, VFAs were the main 13 \nSCOD constituent during fermentation independent of the initial sludge initial characteristics. 14 \nFermentation of sludge is described the happen through hydrolysis of complex organic matter into 15 \nsoluble organic compounds that are transformed into volatile fatty acids during acidogenesis. 16 \nBetween 69-94% of the SCOD generated during primary sludge fermentation from sites 1-5 were 17 \nVFAs (Table 2, Fig.1). Others have reported a proportion of 85% VFAs [5]. Comparatively, only 18 \napproximately 12% of the SCOD released during SAS disintegration were VFAs. In a previous 19 \nstudy it was demonstrated that the SCOD released during SAS disintegration was composed of 20 \nproteins (30%), carbohydrates (13%) and VFAs (12%) but the remaining 45% of the SCOD was not 21 \ncharacterised [16]. Other studies have also identified SCOD as the main product  [22]  that could be 22 \nfractionated into proteins, extracellular polymeric substances and soluble microbial products  after 23 \nultrasound [23, 24] or thermal treatment [25], but the identification of the complete range of 24 \nsubstances that contribute to SCOD has not yet been described.   25 \n 26 \nPage 8 of 26\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n \n \n8 \nMainly acetic acid (41%) and propionic acid (36%) were produced during primary sludge 1 \nfermentation for Sites 1, 2 and 3 with an acetic acid production of 47-62 g kg\n-1\n TSS (Fig. 2). Other 2 \nauthors have observed equivalent VFAs production after fermentation of primary sludge at 20\u00b0C 3 \nwith 43% of acetic acid and 41% of propionic acid [19]. VFAs production was observed to 4 \npredominantly occur during the first 40h of primary sludge fermentation with rates between 0.118 g 5 \nVFAs h\n-1\n (Site 1) to 0.188 g VFAs h\n-1\n (Site 5). Between 46h and 80h, fermentation processes 6 \noccurred at a lower rate and the VFAs formation rates decreased to values of 0.03 g VFAs h\n-1\n (Site 7 \n1). On the other hand, SAS disintegration mainly produced acetic acid (90%) and propionic acid 8 \n(10%) (Fig. 2). 9 \n 10 \n3.2 Nutrient removal predictive tests  11 \nNutrient predictive tests can be used to estimate the BNR performance using a specific carbon 12 \nsource [20]. These tests are based on the PO4-P release after a specific period of time and the 13 \ndenitrification rates, giving an indication of P and N removal, respectively. Two tests were 14 \nconducted in order to match the carbon addition in VFAs (3.5 mg l\n-1\n) and SCOD  (50 mg l\n-1\n) 15 \nconcentration with the aim of assessing separately the influence of SCOD and VFAs on P and N 16 \nremoval. The nutrient removal tests were done in parallel using the same source of wastewater 17 \nimplying the same microbial community as inoculum and only parameter that was changed was the 18 \ncarbon source. Therefore it should be possible to compare the impact of the different carbon sources 19 \non the nutrient removal rates.  20 \n 21 \nWhen the carbon addition was matched in total VFAs concentration, the highest P release rates 22 \nwere obtained for the disintegrated SAS supernatant and disintegrated SAS with values of 0.026 23 \nand 0.025 mg PO4-P g\n-1\n VSS min\n-1\n, respectively (Fig. 3a). Comparable results were obtained in the 24 \ndenitrification tests with the highest denitrification rates measured for the SAS disintegrated sludge 25 \nand supernatant 0.039 and 0.036 mg NO3-N g\n-1\n VSS min\n-1\n, respectively (Fig. 4a).When the carbon 26 \nPage 9 of 26\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n \n \n9 \naddition was matched in terms of SCOD the highest phosphorus release rate was obtained for 1 \ndisintegrated SAS (0.031 mg PO4-P g\n-1\n VSS min\n-1\n) and the lowest for acetate (0.024 mg PO4-P g\n-1\n 2 \nVSS min\n-1\n) (Fig. 3a). The denitrification tests showed the same trend with rates of 0.038, 0.040 and 3 \n0.039 mg NO3-N g\n-1\n VSS min\n-1\n for disintegrated SAS, disintegrated SAS supernatant and fermented 4 \nprimary sludge, and the lowest rate for acetate with 0.027 mg NO3-N g\n-1\n VSS min\n-1\n (Fig. 4a).  5 \nFrom the nutrient predictive tests it can be established that the carbon obtained from the sludge was 6 \nmore suitable for BNR (phosphate release and denitrification) than the external acetate carbon 7 \nsource because primary sludge fermentation and disintegrated SAS gave higher phosphate releases 8 \nand denitrification rates. This observation is supported by Fig. 3b and 4b that show phosphate 9 \nreleases and denitrification rates above the values in the control and acetate vessels (baseline). 10 \nFurthermore, the denitrifying bacteria seem to be able to use a wider range carbon sources as 11 \nidentified through the comparison of rates when the carbon was matched in total VFAs and SCOD 12 \n(Figure 4b). Denitrification metabolism is favoured over phosphate release because denitrifying 13 \nbacteria compete over readily available carbon sources with PAOs and can use wider type of carbon 14 \n[26].  The denitrification rates recorded (1.4-1.9 mg NO3-N g\n-1\n VSS h\n-1\n) were similar to those 15 \nobtained with ozonated SAS as a carbon source [29] (Table 3). Denitrification rates have been 16 \ndemonstrated to be dependent on the biomass concentration [30] but also the origin of the biological 17 \nmaterial and its activity [31] which could possibly explain the high rates obtain in other studies that 18 \nvaried between 7-41 mg NO3-N g\n-1\n VSS h\n-1\n (Table 3). This emphasizes that denitrification tests 19 \nshould be completed for a specific wastewater\/carbon source and compared with a control using the 20 \nsame source of denitrifying bacteria [20].  Treatment of ammonia and nitrate in anaerobic 21 \nconditions has also been demonstrated by using enriched cultures of ANAMMOX (anaerobic 22 \nammonium oxidation bacteria) [27]. 23 \n 24 \n 25 \nPage 10 of 26\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n \n \n10 \nThe phosphorus release rates (0.9-1.5 mg PO4-P g\n-1\n VSS h\n-1\n) determined for the internal carbon 1 \nsources were in the same range of reported rates, between 1.3-2.5 mg PO4-P g\n-1\n VSS h\n-1\n (Table 3). 2 \nThe PAOs responsible for phosphate release, were more selective with regard to carbon source use 3 \nas was demonstrated by differences in the PO4-P release rates when the carbon source was matched 4 \nin total VFAs in comparison with SCOD (up to 0.01 mg PO4-P g\n-1\n VSS min\n-1\n higher when matched 5 \nin total VFAs) (Fig. 3b). The internal carbon sources not only contained VFAs, but also other 6 \nsubstances that contributed to the SCOD. The SCOD of the wastewater after internal carbon 7 \naddition matched on VFAs was on average 63 mg l\n-1\n (fermented primary sludge addition) and 91 8 \nmg l\n-1 \nfor the disintegrated SAS in comparison with 50 mg l\n-1\n in the vessel supplemented with 9 \nacetate. Hence, the microbial species that complete phosphate release not only use VFAs but also 10 \nother sources of soluble carbon [20]. Adaptation of the biomass to the carbon source could further 11 \nenhance the phosphorus release rates to 5.9 mg PO4-P g\n-1\n VSS h\n-1\n as it has been demonstrated by 12 \nPuig et al. [28].  13 \n 14 \n3.3 Carbon to nutrient ratios 15 \nThe fermented primary sludge and the disintegrated sludge were further compared by calculating 16 \nthe carbon to phosphorus (SCOD:PO4-Prelease) and carbon to nitrate (SCOD: NO3-N) ratios which 17 \ncan be used to estimate the BNR potential of a specific wastewater\/carbon source [2] (Table 3). The 18 \nSCOD:PO4-Prelease ratio varied between 8:1 for disintegrated SAS and 15:1 for acetate and the 19 \nSCOD:NO3-N ratio ranged between 9:1 and 12:1 (Table 3). Both SCOD:PO4-Prelease and SCOD: 20 \nNO3-N ratios indicate that the most effective carbon source for BNR was disintegrated SAS. A 21 \nsubstantial difference between SCOD:PO4-Prelease for disintegrated SAS and fermented primary 22 \nsludge with values of 8 and 15, respectively, was observed. As previously described, nutrient 23 \nrelease with disintegrated SAS was not enhanced by the presence of viable PAOs after 24 \ndisintegration [20]. The difference between SCOD:PO4-Prelease ratio recorded for the SAS and 25 \nprimary sludge carbon sources was likely to be linked to the type of carbon and bioavailability. The 26 \nPage 11 of 26\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n \n \n11 \nmain SCOD component of fermented primary sludge was VFAs corresponding to 90% of the 1 \nSCOD and this type of carbon source has been extensively studied for BNR enhancement [2, 7, 8]. 2 \nYet the SCOD products of SAS disintegration have not been completely identified since only 3 \napproximately 12% were VFAs with 45% of the SCOD remaining uncharacterised [16]. Further 4 \nwork needs to be completed to identify the products of the SAS disintegration that enhance BNR (P 5 \nrelease and NO3\n-\n reduction) at rates above acetate and fermented primary sludge (Table 3).  6 \n 7 \n 3.4 Implications of using primary sludge fermentation and SAS disintegration as carbon sources to 8 \nthe sewage treatment works 9 \nThe disintegration of SAS was observed to enhance NH4\n+\n and PO4-P concentrations from 10 mg 10 \nNH4\n+ \nl\n-1\n and 159 mg PO4-P l\n-1\n to 60 mg NH4\n+\n l\n-1\nand 500 mg PO4-P l\n-1\n, respectively, i.e. the nutrients 11 \nincreased by a factor of 6 (NH4\n+\n) and 3.5 (PO4-P) (Table 2). The SAS disintegration promoted 12 \nhigher phosphate release than sludge fermentation since this nutrient is removed from the 13 \nwastewater by accumulation in the biomass [32] and it was solubilised during the disintegration 14 \nprocess.  The NH4\n+\n and PO4-P concentrations were also observed to increase during the 15 \nfermentation period (Table 2) and a strong correlation was observed between acetic acid production 16 \nwith both ammonia (correlation factors R\n2\n from 0.73 to 0.96) and phosphorus release (correlation 17 \nfactors R\n2 \nfrom 0.88 to 0.94). On average, the PO4-P and NH4\n+\n release from the fermentation of 18 \nprimary sludge was 2.1 and 4 fold higher than the initial concentration of 18.3 mg PO4-P l\n-1\n and 19 \n111.9 mg NH4\n+\n l\n-1\n.  20 \nThe implications of using primary sludge fermentation and SAS disintegration as carbon source 21 \nwere assessed by completing a nutrient mass balance to a full-scale BNR treatment works treating 22 \n10,000 m\n3\n day\n-1\n of wastewater (Table 4). The volumes of fermented primary sludge and 23 \ndisintegrated SAS added to the BNR settled sewage were calculated based on predictive tests match 24 \non SCOD (fermented primary sludge 4.2 ml in 2 l of wastewater and disintegrated SAS 13 ml in 2 l 25 \nof wastewater) with dilution factors of 0.0021 and 0.0065 in the wastewater, respectively. The 26 \nPage 12 of 26\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n \n \n12 \naddition of fermented sludge would increase the ammonia load by 13 kg day\n-1\n and PO4-P by 2 kg 1 \nday\n-1\n in the settled sewage fed to the BNR process. The addition of disintegrated SAS was likely to 2 \nincrease the PO4-P in the settled sewage feeding the BNR process by an additional load of 33 kg 3 \nday\n-1\n.   4 \n 5 \nThe ratios of nutrient recycled to the BNR versus SCOD feed to the process indicate that the use of 6 \ndisintegrated SAS as internal carbon source could lead to a cycling of phosphorus in the STW with 7 \n0.97 g PO4-P kg\n-1\n SCOD. Ammonia concentrations would also be increased (0.11 g NH4\n+\n kg\n-1\n 8 \nSCOD) but to a lesser extent than for phosphorus (Table 4). The addition of primary sludge 9 \nfermentation products for enhancing the BNR process is recommended since the recycling of 10 \nnutrients would be minimised (0.02 g PO4-P kg\n-1\n SCOD and 0.13 g NH4\n+\n kg\n-1\n SCOD). For the SAS 11 \ndisintegration product to be a suitable carbon source for BNR and complement the beneficial carbon 12 \nto nutrient ratios here described, the phosphorus would potentially need to be removed from the 13 \ndisintegration liquors. Phosphate removal could be achieved using chemical precipitation with iron 14 \nsulphate or alum or alternatively, struvite (MgNH4PO4.6H2O)  formation could be promoted by 15 \nproviding suitable conditions for its precipitation (pH 8.5 and a ratio of 1:1:1 of 16 \nphosphate:ammonia: magnesium) with 80% phosphate recovery  [33]. In addition, an economical 17 \nevaluation has demonstrated that sludge disintegration using a deflaker is an energy intensive 18 \nprocess (6138 kW day\n-1 \nin a 50,000 m\n3\n day\n-1\n treatment works) [20] in comparison with sludge 19 \nfermentation with virtually no operational costs associated [9].    20 \n 21 \n4. Conclusions  22 \nThe fermentation of primary sludge promotes VFAs production as 69-94% of the SCOD generated 23 \nconsisted of VFAs, compared with approximately 12% VFAs in the SCOD released during SAS 24 \ndisintegration. Higher VFAs yields were observed during the first 40h of fermentation.  25 \n 26 \nPage 13 of 26\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n \n \n13 \nThe nutrient removal tests demonstrated that internal carbon sources obtained from sewage sludge 1 \nenhanced phosphate release and denitrification compared with acetate. The disintegrated SAS was 2 \nthe more suitable carbon source for BNR compared with fermented primary sludge (SCOD:PO4-3 \nPrelease ratio of 8 and SCOD:NO3 ratio of 9) since other components contributing to SCOD besides 4 \nVFAs promoted BNR. Further work should be completed to identify these products of SAS 5 \ndisintegration. However for disintegrated SAS to be considered a suitable carbon source for BNR 6 \nthe PO4-P would potentially need to be removed before recycling to the BNR wastewater. Overall 7 \nthe addition of primary sludge fermentation products for enhancing the BNR process is 8 \nrecommended since the recycling of nutrients would be minimised (0.02 g PO4-P kg\n-1\n SCOD and 9 \n0.13 g NH4\n+\n kg\n-1\n SCOD).  10 \n 11 \nAcknowledgments 12 \nThe submitted manuscript has been made possible through funding from Yorkshire Water, UK.
