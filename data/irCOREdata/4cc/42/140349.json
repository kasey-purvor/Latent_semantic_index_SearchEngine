Results from static tests are used to build master curves \nat specific degree of cure while shift factors are compared with corresponded values from \ndynamic experiments in order to assess the validity of time temperature superposition for each \nconversion. Neat resin plates have been accurately cured, according to the full kinetics model \nfor dynamic and isothermal temperature regime; conversion gradient within the plane and \nthrough the thickness was assessed by thermal analysis of samples taken from different \nlocations before extracting the samples from the plates.  \nViscoelastic behaviour of the resin matrix shows sensible difference in relaxation time \nspectrum with the conversion according to the provisional trend of mobility theory; higher \nconversion induces horizontal shifting of the principal relaxation time for each level of \nconversion which can be very well related with glass transition at same conversion. Good \nresults have been also obtained for the ultimate modulus of the resin at temperature just before \nthe starting of the co-curing phase for the partially cured samples.  \n \nKEYWORDS:  mechanical property, viscoelasticity, time-temperature superposition, \nconversion, thermoset \n \n \nMechanics of Composite Materials 2008 v 44 n 2 pp. 1-10\n 3\nINTRODUCTION  \n \nThere has been limited work reported in the literature on the development of viscoelastic \nmechanical properties in curing thermosets. Evolution of the mechanical properties with the \nincreasing degree of cure is a very important effect to monitor in order to provide adequate \nmathematical model for process simulation software.  \nAs the thermosetting resin cures, its material characteristics change from the behaviour of a \nviscous liquid (low stiffness) material, in its uncured state, to an elastic rigid solid (high \nstiffness), in its fully cured state. The mechanical properties of this resin phase are governed \nby competing mechanisms of chemical kinetics hardening, due to the polymerization, and \nviscoelastic relaxation phenomena, associated with the high processing temperatures. At \nelevated temperature and near the glass transition temperature, the system is characterised by \na strongly viscoelastic behaviour with cure dependent relaxation times as the cure progresses; \nwhen the temperature is lowered, the elastic behaviour is dominant, with no sensible \nrelaxation effect.  \nConsidering that temperature gradient inside the part and an associated degree of conversion \ngradient lead to a sort of complex \u201cmapping\u201d of the mechanical properties, suitable predictive \nmodels are necessarily required to achieve accurate residual stress analysis. Many efforts have \nbeen focused on the development of relationships between viscoelastic properties and specific \npolymer characteristics, such as molecular weight, molecular weight distribution, and degree \nof branching [1]. White and Mather [2] investigated the effect of cure on viscoelastic \nproperties using ultrasonic techniques, while dielectric techniques have been used to \ncharacterize curing polymers [3] by relating ionic mobility to dynamic viscosity. Suzuki et al. \n[4] presented relaxation data for epoxies cured according to various cure cycles. However, in \nthis analysis, the cure states of these samples were not determined. Therefore, relationship \nbetween mechanical properties and cure evolution could not be properly explored. In work by \nKim and Hahn [5], the progression of the elastic modulus of thermoset resins has been \nreported to have a linear relationship with the degree of cure in the region of liquid-solid \ntransformation. Outside this region two fixed values were assumed, respectively for the elastic \nmodulus of uncured and fully cured system. Kim and White reported a systematic analysis of \nthe effect of cure state on the stress relaxation modulus, the relaxation spectrum and the glass \ntransition temperature [6,7]. Recently, Simon et al. [8] have presented an interesting research \nwork on cure-dependent storage modulus for a commercial toughened epoxy resin. Giving a \ngeneral methodology to model the time-temperature-conversion effects of viscoelastic \nMechanics of Composite Materials 2008 v 44 n 2 pp. 1-10\nresponse of thermosets, the predictions of the shear modulus for a general temperature history \nprofile are presented. Based on the same time-cure superposition and extended to a more \ngeneral concept of time-cure-temperature superposition principles is the methodology \npresented by Manson et al. [9] used to predict the viscoelastic properties of an high ultimate \nglass transition temperature epoxy resin at any stage during complex cure cycles. While \nexperimental data in all the above cited works are limited to the post-gelation region, in \nO`Brien et al. [10] a complete understanding of the mechanism that drive the development of \nmaterial properties during the cure is presented by a series of experiments on the unreacted or \npartially reacted liquid resin as well as on the post-gelled resin. The authors have used inter-\nrelationships between viscoelastic properties obtained by both dynamic and static \nexperiments, depending on the handling state of the resin system, to evaluate one mechanical \nproperty from another one. Master curves for creep compliance and for storage and loss \nmodulus were constructed and their shift factors analysed. \nIn this work, neat resin specimens were manufactured at various post-gelation degrees of \nconversion and tested under static stress relaxation and dynamic mode at different \ntemperatures. Using raw data from static tests, master curves and shift factors were derived \napplying the time-temperature superposition principle. Obtained shift factors are then back-\napplied to dynamic raw data from dynamo-mechanical tests performed on the same samples \nto proof validity of the master curve procedure. \n \n \n2 MATERIAL AND EXPERIMENTS \n2.1 Materials and sample preparation  \n \nThe main system considered in the present work is a TGDDM based resin, with catalyzed \nDDS cure and containing about 25% by weight of thermoplastic. The resin appears as \ntranslucent paste at room temperature with quite high viscosity. According to the \nmanufacturer, the shelf life at  is 10 months and the glass transition temperature for \nthe fully cured system is about . No more details were given for this system, since it is \nnot yet available on the market. \nCo18\u2212\nCo200\nResin plates were cast using the mould shown schematically in Fig. 1. Handling problems \nrelated with resin flow as well as the generation of excessive degree of cure gradients within \nthe sample are the major considerations in designing the moulding procedure. A thin layer of \n 4\nMechanics of Composite Materials 2008 v 44 n 2 pp. 1-10\nPTFE\/glass release film was stuck to each of the two glass plates, using PTFE tape at each \nend. The use of PTFE enabled easier release of the samples from the mould. In some cases, \nalso liquid release agent (FREEKOTE 700) was used. The two metal bars were separated by a \nspacer of either rubber or aluminium, in which a reservoir was cut off. The spacer was held in \nplace using double side PTFE tape on one mould and then the two moulds were held together \nusing metallic jig clamps.  \nFive different plates of partially cured resin (dimension 200 \u00d7 400 \u00d7 2.5 mm) were prepared \nunder isothermal conditions ( - ) for different periods, in order to achieve \npartially cure material at various extents. They were classified by labels A, B, C, D, E, with \ndegree of conversion increasing from A to E. For sample labelled as E, full conversion was \nexpected, based on the results of cure kinetics modelling. \nC\u00b0180 C\u00b0160\n \n2.3 Sample conversion assessment by Differential Scanning Calorimetry \n \nSince the aim of the mechanical characterization was to acquire the necessary raw data to \nbuild the corresponding \u201cmaster curves\u201d at a particular degree of conversion, uniformly cured \nsamples were required. According to results of the cure kinetics model11 different samples \nwere prepared with accurate temperature profile and off-line measurements were also \nperformed on each sample to verify the uniformity of conversion for each specimen both in \nplane and through thickness.  \nFigure 2 reports a schematic representation of the specimens\u2019 location on one side. All \nsamples, of about  , were scanned by DSC from room temperature to 340\u00b0C at a \nheating rate of 10\u00b0C\/min to evaluate both the residual heat of reaction and the glass transition \ntemperature. These two values provide useful information for evaluating the degree of \nconversion for each specimen and therefore they can be used to quantify the level of \nuniformity of conversion reached by the whole plates. The glass transition temeprature was \ndetermined as the inflection point of the heat flow step in the DSC signal in a thermal scan at \n10 K min\n43\u2212 mg\n\u22121 for the isothermally cured samples; while for the dynamically cured specimens the \nsame heating rate was used in order to avoid discrepancies due to rate dependence of glass \ntransition. DSC tests were performed on 10 different samples taken from the same rectangular \nplate, respectively from each of the two sides to evaluate through-the-thickness and on each \nside, from the four corners and from the middle position, to evaluate in-plane degree of \nconversion gradient. \n 5\n \nMechanics of Composite Materials 2008 v 44 n 2 pp. 1-10\n2.4 Dynamic Torsional Rheometric Tests \n \nRheometric test using a torsional clamp system for solid samples were performed on partially \ncured materials. Specimens were cut from the plates after the degrees of conversion were \nassessed, using a low speed saw wafer machine. The cell mounted on the AR2000 rheometric \nequipment from TA Instruments is an Environmental Test Chamber (ETC) with thermal \ncontrolling system in the range  to  with maximum heating rate of . \nAll solid torsional tests were performed according to the specifications of ASTM D4065. \nC\u00b0\u2212150 C\u00b0600 min\/15 C\u00b0\n \n2.5 Static and dynamic 3 point bending tests  \n \nStress relaxation and dynamical mechanical tests were performed by a TA-2940 DMA \nmachine on rectangular strips taken from each of the partially cured plate. For the dynamic \ntests, specimens with dimensions of 50 x 12 x 3 mm were cut from each plate and subjected to \nfrequency sweep tests between 0.01 Hz and 100 Hz at different isothermal temperatures under \nthree-point bending test configuration. Each sample was equilibrated for about 5 minutes \nbefore test segment starting at each temperature, to provide a uniform temperature distribution \ninside the material during the frequency sweep. A total of 22 step-and-hold segments \n(between 25 and 320\u00b0C) were considered in the machine program for all tests. However, since \nthe partially cured resin had a glass transition temperature of 104\u00b0C for the least cured plate \n(A) and 181\u00b0C for the almost totally cured plate (E), only data in the region 25\u00b0C to 220\u00b0C \nhave been used to build the corresponding dynamic master curves. When the material starts to \nreact further, the test results are meaningless because of the changing degree of conversion. \nThe same instrument was used to analyse the viscoelastic behaviour in the post-gelation \nregion by 3 points bending under stress relaxation mode. In a simple stress relaxation \nexperiment, the material specimen is subjected initially to a constant strain and the time-\ndependent stress response is observed. In order to set the experiment on stress level within the \nrange of linear viscoelasticity, some preliminary experiments have been performed with a \nfixed load rate. Final static tests, step-and-hold segments were performed at different \ntemperatures up to the correspondent glass transition temperature. Three specimens were \ntested for each degree of conversion. After clamping, the specimens were equilibrated for 30 \nmin at  and then deformed for 40 min. Afterwards, the temperature was increased C\u00b030\n 6\nMechanics of Composite Materials 2008 v 44 n 2 pp. 1-10\nC\u00b0\u2212155  and data acquisition was triggered. Above the glass transition temperature the test \nwas stopped because of the onset of the post cure reaction.  \n \n \n3 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS \n3.1 Thermal analysis results \n \nCalorimetric analysis of preliminary cast plates has revealed a high variability of degree of \ncure within the sample to invalidate further investigation, as mechanical testing or thermo-\nmechanical analysis. For these reasons, the determination and the minimization of the spread \nin the degree of conversion for each sample used for the dynamic and static mechanical tests \nhas been an important issue to deal with during the preliminary stage of sample preparation. \nSince the aim of the mechanical characterization was to acquire the necessary raw data to \nconstruct the corresponding \u201cmaster curves\u201d at a particular degree of conversion, uniformly \ncured samples were required.  \nFigure 3 reports DSC scans for material taken from the least cured plate studied (labelled A); \nsamples were extracted from the four corners and from the centre of this plate in order to \nstudy the in-plane conversion gradient. A value of  for the glass transition temperature \nwas found as the average value of all five measurements. Using the DiBenedetto glass \ntransition model developed for the resin system of this study by Zarrelli et al. [\nC\u00b0104\n11] the value \nof degree of cure corresponding to CTg \u00b0= 104  was found to be 0.68. The same type of \nanalysis was performed for the plate made of resin, type B, C, D, and E [12]. The degree of \ncure were also checked using the residual heat generation values and compared with resin \nkinetic model12, in order to determine the actual degree of conversion at the location from \nwhich the specimen was taken. Average values for the glass transition temperature, for \nresidual heat of reaction and for the corresponding degree of conversion for all five partially \ncured plates (A-B-C-D-E) are reported in table 1. For plate, E the analysis of the heat flow \nprofile has shown more uniform results with a very low value of variance for the residual heat \nof reaction. Figure 4 reports the non-reversible and reversible signal obtained by testing \nsample from plate labelled E (fully cured) by means of modulated dynamic scanning \ncalorimetry (MDSC).  \n \n 7\nMechanics of Composite Materials 2008 v 44 n 2 pp. 1-10\n3.2 Solid rheometry results  \n \nFrom each plate, five sets of three samples each were obtained by cutting and polishing. One \nof the sets was used to perform solid rheometric tests in order to verify the glass transition \ntemperature and hence to assess the degree of conversion reached by the resin plates. The \nvalues obtained for the glass transition temperatures are higher than the corresponding values \ncalculated using DSC technique. The difference can be attributed to the finite dimensions of \nthe specimens. Negligible variation in degree of conversion has been found using the \nmechanically evaluated values of . Figure 5 reports the results of dynamic rheometric scans \non all five specimens. Here, the  is defined as the temperature corresponding to the \nmaximum value of \ngT\ngT\n\u03b4tan , no experimental data could be obtained at degrees of cure lower \nthan the level reached for plate A, due to the inherent fragility of the sample associated with \nthe near gelation conversion, during the clamping or initial deformation of the sample.  \n \n3.3 Static and Dynamic results on solid samples \n \nAll the experimental data presented in this section are averaged over three different \nexperiments. In the case of static experiments, depending upon the temperature range (from \nroom temperature to the sample's glass transition temperature) and step increment, the time \nrequired to complete each test was between 300 min and 800 min. Raw data for the case of \n0.90\u03b1 = , are reported in Fig. 6. The relaxation moduli for the entire partially cured sample \nare reported in Fig.6 and Fig.7 as raw data. The temperature ranges from  to the TC\u00b025 g of \nthe corresponding sample as measured by the torsional rheometer tests. For all the partially \ncured samples, the approach of the glass transition is clearly reflected by a sharp drop in the \nmodulus. At the lowest temperatures, all the samples show glassy behaviour with an average \nmodulus of about ; this value was treated as constant during the subsequent fitting \nprocedure. Near the , the rubbery modulus reached a plateau value ranging from  \nfor the least cured sample to  for the fully cured resin samples. \nGPa4.3\ngT MPa38.1\nMPa9.60\nIt is important to emphasise that as the testing temperature is raised through the glass \ntransition temperature, the raw data acquired become meaningless because of the onset of the \npost cure reaction. The raw data obtained were used to construct the relaxation modulus \nmaster curves up to the corresponding sample  according to the time-temperature gT\n 8\nMechanics of Composite Materials 2008 v 44 n 2 pp. 1-10\nsuperposition principle with temperature of CTref \u00b0= 32  was used as the reference \ntemperature with no vertical shifts. Figure 9 reports all smoothed experimental master curves \nas used for further analysis. \n \n3.4 Master curves and shift factors: results \n \nFor viscoelastic materials, the mechanical response is history-dependent and involves the use \nof a reduced time. Reduced time can be written using the temperature-cure dependent shift \nfactor, ( TaT , )\u03b1  from the integral in the following form: \n \n( )Ta\nt\nT ,\u03b1\u03be =            Eq.1 \n \nwhere ( Tt ,, )\u03b1\u03be  is the reduced time,  is the actual experimental time and t ( TaT , )\u03b1  is the \ntemperature-conversion shift factor value. For polymeric materials, shift factors are generally \nfunctions of temperature; in the case of a reactive system the dependence on the conversion \nneeds to be taken into account in implementing the model. Fig. 10 shows the horizontal shift \nfactors used to generate the master curves of stress relaxation modulus. \nThe application of the reduced variable method needs to be verified for the analogous data \nobtained under dynamic conditions. Using the same values of shift factor, master curves of \ndynamic storage and loss modulus were generated from raw data obtained from dynamic tests \nbased on frequency sweeps. All these curves for the almost fully cured samples (label E) are \nshown in figs. 11 and 12. \nThe curves were built using  as the reference temperature and no vertical shift was \ninvolved. At the lowest frequencies, storage modulus shows glassy behaviour with a linear \nvariation of the modulus. O\u2019Brien\nCT \u00b0= 30\n10 obtained the same behaviour for a different epoxy resin. \nAt very low frequencies, corresponding to high temperatures of the raw testing data, values of \nthe moduli cannot be acquired because of the inherent onset of the post cure reaction. Similar \nproof tests for the shift factor values have been performed for all five levels of conversion, \nand give satisfactory results in terms of dynamic master curves (see figure 13). In order to \npredict the evolution of the viscoelastic mechanical properties of the neat resin during cure, \nthe shift factor curves need to be modelled with respect to both temperature and the degree of \ncure.  \n 9\nMechanics of Composite Materials 2008 v 44 n 2 pp. 1-10\n 10\n4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \nThe viscoelastic mechanical properties of the neat resin system were investigated at different \ndegrees of conversion. Five different levels of conversion have been considered, the resin \nplates being cured under appropriate conditions, as defined by the kinetic data presented \npreviously13.  \nUsing differential mechanical analysis, stress relaxation measurements based on step loading \nand holding tests have been made on samples cut from partially cured resin plates. Master \ncurves have been drawn from the raw data and the shift factors obtained have been verified \nfor the dynamic data. Results show that appropriate master curves can be drawn for each \ndegree of conversion and typical relaxation time can be evaluated. As expected, principal \nrelaxation time are right shifted along the time axis as the cure advances. This is a typical \nbehaviour as the more complex structure necessary induced longer time for the viscoleastic \nrelaxation of the modulus.  \n \n \n5 ACKNOWLEDGE \n \n \nThis work was funded by the EPSRC (GR\/M 89454).  \nMechanics of Composite Materials 2008 v 44 n 2 pp. 1-10\nFIGURES \n \n \nMould Spacer \nJig Clamps\nPTFE\/glass release film \n400 mm\n20\n0 \nm\nm\n \n \nFig. 1 Mould assembly for mechanical test samples (dimensions given for single resin plate) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSide 1 corner 1      \nSide 1 corner 3   \nSide 1, centre location \n \n \nFig. 2 Schematic neat resin plate with location of DSC sample used for quality inspection \n \n 11\nMechanics of Composite Materials 2008 v 44 n 2 pp. 1-10\n-0.4\n-0.2\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n40 110 180 250 320\nTemperature (\u00b0C)\nH\nea\nt F\nlo\nw\n (W\n\/g\n)\nSample A - s1 c1 Sample A - s1 c2 Sample A - s1 c3\nSample A - s1 c4 Sample A - s1 center\nTg=104\u00b0C\n \nFig. 3 Heat flow diagrams obtained by DSC measurements on specimens taken from the four corners and the \ncentre position of resin plate A (\u03b1=0.68).
