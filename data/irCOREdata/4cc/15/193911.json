Doi: 10.1016\/S0005-1098(00)00118-7Metadata only entryThe Youla parametrization of two-degree-of-freedom controllers reveals that the design of the prefilter and the design of the regulator can be done independently. In this paper, a unified framework is proposed to address the design of the feedforward part of a two-degree-of-freedom controller. The approach deals both with tracking of a causal reference signal and with rejection of a causal measurable disturbance. It is shown that the determination of a feedforward filter, with a constraint on the nominal control effort, reduces to the solution of a particular full-information problem. The approach is attractive because it leads to a significant reduction in the number of decision variables in the design process. The method also extends naturally to plants in a polytope. Its effectiveness is demonstrated on two numerical examples. In the first example, the design of a linear time-invariant feedforward controller is carried out to reject a measurable disturbance and to follow a reference signal; while in the second example, we address the design of a robust gain scheduled two-degree-of-freedom controller","downloadUrl":"","fullTextIdentifier":null,"pdfHashValue":null,"publisher":"Elsevier","rawRecordXml":"<record><header><identifier>\n        \n            \n                oai:lra.le.ac.uk:2381\/1978<\/identifier><datestamp>\n                2017-01-06T12:33:43Z<\/datestamp><setSpec>\n                com_2381_171<\/setSpec><setSpec>\n                com_2381_9549<\/setSpec><setSpec>\n                col_2381_835<\/setSpec>\n            <\/header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:oai_dc=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/\" xmlns:dc=\"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/\" xmlns:doc=\"http:\/\/www.lyncode.com\/xoai\" xmlns:xsi=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/ http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc.xsd\" ><dc:title>\n            \nFeedforward control: a full-information approach<\/dc:title><dc:creator>\nPrempain, E.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nPostlethwaite, Ian<\/dc:creator><dc:description>\nThis paper was published as Automatica, 2001, 37 (1), pp.17-28.
