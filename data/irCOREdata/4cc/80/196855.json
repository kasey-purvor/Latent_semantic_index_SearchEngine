Since the 1970s more than 40 Interregional Trade \nUnion Councils (IRTUCs) have been established. This article investigates emerging practices \nof cross-border trade union cooperation in the West Pannonia region between Eastern \nAustria and Western Hungary. It argues that IRTUCs can play an important role in fuelling \ncooperation to preserve wages and labour rights in cross-border regions, particularly in \nsectors with high precarious employment. While actual practices are contingent on regional \nunion strategies as well as industrial relations and labour market institutions, cross-border \ncooperation occupies an important place within European industrial relations practices and \ncan support new forms of capacity-building.  \n \n \nKeywords \ncross-border region, trade union cooperation, Interregional Trade Union Council, European \nindustrial relations, Austria, Hungary  \n \n \nIntroduction \n \nPolitical and academic debates on developing cross-border trade union and bargaining coordination, as \nwell as the industrial relations processes at European level, have focused on European Works Councils \n 2 \n(EWCs) and (sectoral) social dialogue (Lecher et al., 2001; Marginson and Sisson, 2004). When it \ncomes to unilateral trade union cooperation, the main emphasis is on bargaining coordination at \nsectoral level (Gollbach and Schulten, 2000; Traxler et al., 2008). However, parallel to these \nprocesses, we can observe the emergence of a large number of Interregional Trade Union Councils \n(IRTUCs) over the last three decades. These councils were established as bottom-up initiatives in \norder to deal with labour market problems in adjoining (usually sub-national) regions in different EU \ncountries (in a few cases including non-EU states). The analysis in this article is concerned with the \nfunctions and forms of cross-border cooperation in IRTUCs which, it is argued, is shaped by a number \nof asymmetries in the industrial relations and labour market institutions across their constituent \nregions. For example, their remit has to be limited to interregional labour markets as cross-border \nregions do not overlap sufficiently with product markets. Equally, it has to be limited to trade union \ncooperation, rather than bargaining coordination, as the regional level rarely has a role in bargaining \nprocesses. Thus, the focus of IRTUCs has to be protecting minimum wages and social standards in the \nface of disparities across borders in the first instance. However, the increasing role of the regional \nlevel and EU regional policy, as well as the importance of linking the local and the global in cross-\nborder trade union networks, could give more weight to interregional trade union action.  \nThe emergence of IRTUCs prompts important questions as to the function, substance and form \nof interregional trade union cooperation in the face of economic disparities; across different industrial \nrelations systems, trade union interests and strategies; about the leverage cooperation can exert on \ninterregional labour market dynamics and solidarities. The argument put forward here is that IRTUCs \nconstitute a strategic and organizational answer in order to protect minimum wages and social \nstandards. While this is where the interests of the unions within the IRTUCs meet, the actual forms of \ncross-border cooperation are the result of inter-union compromises on social dialogue(s), institutional \nand informal trade union networks, as well as capacity-building and organizing, a combination which \ndepends on each institutional and strategic context. Cooperation within IRTUCs is important, as it \ncaptures economic and social issues at a geographical scale that escapes cross-border social dialogue \nand bargaining coordination. This article first discusses IRTUC cross-border cooperation in general \nand a case study of the IRTUC West Pannonia, situated at the border between Austria and Hungary. \nThis provides the background for an analysis of functions of and forms of IRTUCs, and how these \nrelate to wider issues of cross-border trade union cooperation.  \n \n \nWhat function for interregional trade union cooperation? \n \nRecent debates on cross-border bargaining coordination in Europe have stressed the structural \nasymmetry that stems from the economic constraints of the Single European Market and European \nMonetary Union on the one hand, and the nationally based industrial relations systems of the member \n 3 \nstates on the other. The opening of capital markets as well as the abandonment of inflation and \nexchange rate policies to support employment goals has increased pressures to use wage policies for \neconomic adjustment. The 2004 enlargement round has further increased the challenges of cross-\nborder bargaining cooperation, since single-employer bargaining systems and relatively weak and \nfragmented trade unions dominate the industrial relations systems in the New Member States (NMS) \n(Slovenia is the notable exception).  \nSo far, the broad focus of unions\u2019 strategic efforts as well as academic debates has been on the \nsectoral level. Given the development of the European sectoral social dialogue, of initiatives to \ncoordinate inter-national bargaining and political pressure from the European Commission (including \nspecific regulation in some sectors), the sectoral level constitutes the actual (if weak) terrain of \nbargaining coordination (Marginson, 2005; Marginson and Traxler, 2005; Schulten, 2003). The \ntheoretical rationale for the importance of the sectoral level refers back to Commons (1909) and holds \nthat trade union coordination needs to be aligned to the scope of market integration in order to counter \nthe asymmetries in the regulation of capital on the one hand, and of employment and social issues on \nthe other (Marginson and Traxler, 2005: 424). Here, a related issue concerns the actual process \nthrough which coordination is to be achieved, an issue that is further complicated at European level by \nthe dominance of single-employer bargaining in most NMSs. First, reflecting the weakness of trade \nunion organization both at sectoral level and in the workplace, bargaining coverage is relatively low in \nmost NMSs, ranging from under 20 percent in Lithuania and Latvia to 100 percent in Slovenia (Visser, \n2004: 30). Second, such structures result in obvious difficulties in establishing and aligning vertical \nand horizontal coordination. Third, there is the tricky issue of establishing cross-border bargaining \ncoordination between single and multi-employer systems. Marginson and Traxler (2005) argue that a \nstrong trade union presence in lead firms could help in establishing a \u2018going rate\u2019 and thereby provide \na substitute for sectoral collective bargaining, leading to a differentiated (according to the \ncircumstances of the sector) and dual strategy (linking multi-employer with single-employer \nbargaining). Traxler et al. (2008) have recently underlined the logical potential of pattern bargaining as \nwell as its likely empirical use as a latent form of coordination. \nIn contrast to such inter-national bargaining coordination at sectoral level, IRTUCs represent a \nbottom-up form of cooperation on securing economic and social minimum standards in cross-border \nlabour markets. Their development --- their increasing institutionalization as well as differentiation of \nstrategies --- reflects their particular embeddedness in inter-regional political economies which result \nin very different challenges for cross-border trade union cooperation in the various IRTUCs. The first \nIRTUCs were founded in the late 1970s in the core EU industrial regions and were furthered by three \ndevelopments. First, industrial decline in mining and steel and the threat of competitive adjustment at \nthe expense of the workers led unions to cooperate; the first IRTUC was formally established in 1976 \nby the DGB Saarland representatives, the regional structures of the CGT-FO in Lorraine (later joined \nby CFDT) and the Luxembourg OGB-L (M\u00fcller, 1994: 258). Second, the integration of labour \n 4 \nmarkets in those regions and the increase of cross-border workers provided an important terrain as \nIRTUCs advised on and campaigned for the removal of disadvantages that resulted from differences in \ntax and social insurance legislation. Different bases for the calculation of benefits, for example, often \ndisadvantaged cross-border workers and sometimes led to double taxation without corresponding \nbenefits on either side of the border. Particularly in regions with a long tradition of cross-border \nworking --- along the borders of France, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland --- self-help associations \noften preceded and competed with IRTUCs, certainly with regard to advice as well as political \nlobbying for bilateral treaties on taxation and social insurance (Hamann, 2005). Third, IRTUCs have \ndeveloped parallel to European structural and cohesion policies as well as the cross-border cooperation \nof local and\/or regional authorities within so-called Euroregions at internal and external borders of the \nEU (see Perkmann, 2007). While not a formal actor in Euroregions, IRTUCs have filled a void in \nlabour\u2019s presence in the multi-level European polity and have become a vehicle to campaign on \neconomic, labour market and social policy issues. Thus economic restructuring, liberalization and \nEuropean integration posed incentives for cross-border union cooperation, in the face of increasing \ncross-border disparities of economic growth, employment and wages in successive waves of \nenlargement.  \nAgainst this background, IRTUC cooperation raises an obvious question: if inter-national \nbargaining coordination has been difficult to establish at sectoral level, why should cooperation at the \ninter-regional level --- with incongruent product and labour markets, and trade unions without a role in \nbargaining --- have better chances of success? Any answer will have to take into account the particular \ninstitutional and strategic set-up in a cross-border region; however, we can still highlight three key \nparameters. First, wage disparities and, consequently, labour market pressures only become a problem \nwhere differences in industrial relations and welfare systems can be exploited. This tends to be more \npronounced in cross-border regions, particularly in the most recent generation of IRTUCs with NMS \nregions, and thereby poses incentives for coordination. Labour market pressures exist even where full \nlabour mobility has been restricted for the time being, as this encourages mobility in the form of self-\nemployed, illegal and informal labour (Donaghey and Teague, 2006) and has repercussions on the \nlow-wage segments, social security systems and labour standards for workers in the host and home \ncountries. Second, while unions might have similar interests in interregional convergence in the long-\nterm (stemming an exodus of workers from the low-wage region, safeguarding minimum conditions in \nthe high-wage region), their short-term interests (e.g. regarding the speed or routes towards \nconvergence) might well be different. Third, given the structural place of IRTUCs in their respective \nindustrial relations systems, the economic and social functions of cross-border cooperation have to be \nsought outside collective bargaining (Traxler and Mermet, 2003 discuss this with regard to wage \ncoordination). Thus, against the background of disparate levels of economic development, their \neconomic function is to monitor the integration of interregional labour markets and protect wage and \nemployment levels without giving in to pressures of competitive regionalism (D\u00f6rre and R\u00f6ttger, \n 5 \n2005); their social function is to safeguard labour standards, terms of employment, minimum wages \nand benefits from downward pressures. Importantly, it is mainly the latter area where unions have \nstrategic and organizational capacities to build meaningful cooperation.  \nWhile the goals and interest constellations of cross-border cooperation are different from \nbargaining coordination, the social networks they are based on are not too dissimilar. Schulten (2003: \n118), for example, reports on the cooperation of IG Metall districts with cross-border partner unions:    \n \nAlthough these networks still vary a good deal in terms of their form, scope and the intensity of \ncooperation, issues dealt with so far include: \n\u2022 mutual exchange of trade union observers during collective bargaining rounds including \nmutual participation in trade union bargaining committees; negotiation with the employers \nand industrial action,  \n\u2022 the development of a common day-to-day information system on collective bargaining \nissues,  \n\u2022 common training seminars on the system of collective bargaining and trade unions\u2019 \ncollective bargaining policy,  \n\u2022 common working groups on different collective bargaining issues,  \n\u2022 mutual recognition of trade union membership \n \nThis underlines the importance of establishing social networks and organizational capacity in \novercoming collective action problems and developing cooperation on, both, economic as well as \nsocial issues. IRTUCs\u2019 cross-border cooperation focuses on building trust and solidarity via \ninformation on employment regulations, legal advice and support (thereby drawing workers into \nunions instead of self-help associations; Hamann, 2005); representation of cross-border commuters \nand migrants within as well as outside the labour movement; the function of a resource to facilitate \nand support cross-border networks at sectoral and company level as well as trade union capacity \n(training on organizing and bargaining skills); and political representation vis-\u00e0-vis regional \nauthorities (see below; M\u00fcller, 1994). In this respect, IRTUCs can play an important role at the border \nof the NMSs and articulate a number of factors that are considered central for trade union revival (Ost, \n2009). Their forms and terrains of cooperation span the entire \u2018geometry of trade unionism\u2019 (Hyman, \n2001) while the actual form of cross-border networks and practices of cooperation are the result of a \nstrategic compromise by the unions involved, based on the opportunities afforded by the respective \ninstitutional frameworks.  \nThe following section presents a case study of the IRTUC West Pannonia in the cross-border \nregion of Eastern Austria and Western Hungary. Fieldwork was conducted between August 2006 and \nMarch 2007 and included interviews with regional trade union officers at the peak and sectoral \norganizations (10), IRTUC staff (3), a panel with workplace representatives in Szombathely \n 6 \n(Hungary), attendance at a transport worker Stammtisch (see below) in Gols (Austria), a border \npicketing event at Andau\/J\u00e1nossomorja, as well as the presentation of a survey of cross-border \nworkers (\u00d6GB\/IGR, 2007). The research also included analysis of IRTUC documentation as well as \ninterim reports for the European Commission (Gutknecht-Gmeiner and Henkel, 2005).   \n \n \nThe IRTUC West Pannonia \n \nCross-border contacts between trade unionists in Burgenland, in the far east of Austria, and Western \nHungary stretch back to the 1980s. In the mid-1990s personal networks were intensified and \ntransformed into substantive cooperation, for example through workshops on the social, labour market \nand industrial relations systems in each country, and training for Hungarian unionists on specific \nissues such as re-employment schemes and collective bargaining. As this interregional trade union \ncooperation evolved, the mid-1990s saw a further set of developments that spurred the formation of an \nIRTUC: the quota for foreign workers in the Austrian labour market was continuously increased; in \n1995 Austria became a member of the EU; collaboration between Austrian and Hungarian regional \nauthorities resulted in the foundation of the Euregio West\/Nyugat Pannonia in 1998; and Hungarian \nEU accession became a serious prospect. These were major incentives to institutionalize cross-border \ntrade union cooperation; the IRTUC was agreed in October 1998 and formally launched in July 1999.  \nThe IRTUC was established by the Burgenland regional organization of the Austrian trade union \nconfederation \u00d6GB, and the regional organizations of MSzOSz, the largest Hungarian confederation, \nin the counties of Gy\u0151r-Moson-Sopron, Vas and Zala. The formal structure comprises a conference, an \nexecutive committee, working groups and a control commission in which all regions are represented. \nThe chair of the IRTUC rotates between regions in parallel with the rotating presidency of the Euregio \nWest\/Nyugat Pannonia. The founding document outlined very ambitious programmatic goals, given \nthe resource constraints of the executive and the member unions (IGR Burgenland\/Westungarn, 1999). \nThey ranged from trade union cooperation at sectoral and company level on social and labour market \npolicies, to the harmonization of social minimum standards, working conditions and collective \nbargaining agreements. In the words of an \u00d6GB official: \n \nThe impulse was to reflect on how the union can shape integration when very different wage \nlevels meet, when we will see large numbers of cross-border commuters\u2026 without this resulting \nin too adverse labour market impacts, so that Austrians accept Hungarian cross-border workers, \nto prevent the emergence of xenophobic tendencies, in other words, measures that have an \nimpact in terms of democracy, union policy, workers\u2019 rights, labour market policy\u2026. If you \nlook at our initiatives in the region, starting with information events or workplace-level activity, \nwith Hungarian workers, the main objective is for them to have maximum information and a \n 7 \nstrong representation in order to make it virtually impossible for employers to play off foreign \nagainst domestic workers.  \n \nGiven the large gap between ambitions and resources, the IRTUC sought outside funding for its \nlabour market initiatives. This resulted in a number of projects under the EU initiative INTERREG \nIIIA\/Phare CBC, launched to facilitate cross-border cooperation involving the NMSs. The IRTUC \nproject for the Austrian part received more than \u20ac 1.8 million between July 2002 and December 2007, \nwhile the Hungarian side\u2019s funding came from two smaller Phare CBC projects (each under \u20ac \n100,000) that were conceptually linked to the INTERREG project. It is important to distinguish \nbetween the IRTUC as a political institution and as a labour market project: apart from political and \nfunctional differences, the former was concluded between the regional organizations of \u00d6GB and \nMSzOSz alone, while the latter also included the smaller Hungarian unions MOSz, SzEF, Autonomok, \nESzT and Liga. Still, the range of initiatives discussed below were mainly based on the well staffed \nproject office in Eisenstadt (Austria), with 5 bilingual full-time employees, partly with postgraduate \nlegal education, and MSzOSz regional offices in Gy\u0151r-Moson-Sopron, Vas and Zala. In order to \nsituate the main IRTUC initiatives the following section gives a brief overview of the interregional \nlabour market.  \n \n \nDifferent labour market and industrial relations systems \n \nEconomic growth and average wages have converged in Burgenland and Western Hungary over the \nlast 15 years, although structural change and increased labour market integration had a more \ndifferentiated impact at sectoral level (with persistent north-south disparities). While Burgenland\u2019s \nGDP grew from 62.9 percent of the Austrian average in 1995 to 69.8 percent in 2004, Western \nHungary maintained its above-average position compared to the rest of the country (103 percent to \n104.4 percent; data in this paragraph are from Eurostat). Employment in Burgenland grew by 5.7 \npercent between 1995 and 2004, well above the Austrian average of 1.1 percent; a decline in \nmanufacturing employment was more than offset by increases in wholesale and retail, hotels and \ntourism and transport. Western Hungary, however, recorded a 0.7 percent decline in employment over \nthe same period, which contrasted with the 1.9 percent increase in Hungary as a whole; here, it was the \nconstruction industry, hotels and tourism and manufacturing that experienced strong employment \ngrowth. Unemployment in the two regions is roughly comparable, averaging 4.5 percent and 4.7 \npercent respectively between 1999 and 2006. This is slightly above the Austrian average but a \nconsiderable 1.8 percent below the average for Hungary. During the period 1996-2007, hourly labour \ncost differentials in manufacturing between Hungary and Austria remained significant at an essentially \nconstant 1:3 ratio in purchasing power parities. \n 8 \nIn these economic conditions, the influx of (mainly) Hungarian cross-border workers had an \nimpact on the structure of the labour market. Overall employment in Burgenland increased by 32.7 \npercent to 88,000 between 1989 and 2007, while foreign employment rose more than eightfold and \nthat of Hungarian citizens more than 13 times, although from a low level of 474 to 6,561 (data in this \nparagraph are from Arbeitsmarktservice \u00d6sterreich, the Austrian public employment service). At the \nsame time, about a third of Burgenland\u2019s workers commute further west to work, mainly in the Vienna \nregion. Hungarians accounted for 68 percent of foreign workers in 2007, up from 37 percent in 1989, \nthereby replacing the \u2018traditional\u2019 guest workers of the 1960s and 1970s from Turkey and former \nYugoslavia. This influx has happened despite significant barriers to workers\u2019 freedom of movement \n(the Austrian social partners agreed to open the labour market only after the full transitional period has \nended in 2011). At present, foreigners can work in Austria only under a complex set of quotas and \ndifferent (fixed-term) employment statutes which are being monitored by the authorities and social \npartners. Thus, a considerable proportion of the 6,561 Hungarian workers comprise daily cross-border \ncommuters (Grenzg\u00e4nger), seasonal workers and harvest assistants (in 2007 the contingents for \nBurgenland were 2,350, 625, 1,800 respectively). In 2007 a further category for skilled workers was \nintroduced with a quota of 800 for turners, welders and milling operators; both the quota as well as the \npermissible jobs were expanded considerably for 2008. \nThis context engenders a highly segmented labour market. While skilled Hungarian workers \ncan work as self-employed across the border, Hungarians with low skills work under the selective \nquota of renewable work permits. For example, Hungarians make up 45 and 27 percent of \nemployment in agriculture and hotels and tourism; other major sectors with above-average \nrepresentation are construction and transport (\u00d6GB\/IGR, 2007: 5). Three-quarters are male, while 82 \npercent have left their jobs in Hungary to take up employment in Burgenland (\u00d6GB\/IGR, 2007: 11). \nThey tend to be better qualified than their Austrian counterparts, while earning around 20 percent less; \nonly one-third is sure that pay and benefits are according to their entitlements. Another important \ndividing line is between the formal and informal segments: about a quarter say their employment is \nunregistered or incorrectly registered (particularly in hotels and tourism and in agriculture), and it can \nbe assumed that the real figures are higher (\u00d6GB\/IGR, 2007: 25).  \nInstitutions, resources and capacities to control the labour market are vastly different on the \ntwo sides of the border. Austria has comprehensive industry-wide bargaining and almost 100 percent \ncoverage (Traxler et al., 2008), based on extension provisions, encompassing employer organization \nand good union density (although the latter declined in Burgenland from 63 percent in 1995 to 50 \npercent in 2005). Hungarian collective labour is fragmented and weak, with union density in Western \nHungary around 20 percent. There is a decentralized system of wage determination which privileges \nthe company or workplace level (Neumann, 2002), while sectoral bargaining is ineffective; an \ninterviewee put bargaining coverage at 35 percent (MSzOSz officer, Zala). Resources shed another \nclear light on capacity: while the \u00d6GB Burgenland employs about 10 officers (in addition to those \n 9 \nworking for the affiliated industrial unions and directly for the IRTUC), for a working population of \n86,600 (2004), confederations in Western Hungary have difficulty in establishing county-level \nstructures for the 374,000 employees; in 2002, for example, MSzOSz reduced representation to one \nfull-time officer per region (thereby anticipating the restructuring of regional authorities) (interview, \nMSzOSz officer, Vas). An important institution of labour market information and control, however \nweak, is that of regional tripartite partnership on both sides of the border. In Austria, unions work \nclosely with the regional Arbeitsmarktservice and authorities on quotas and labour market policy; \nsimilarly in Hungary, the tripartite County Labour Councils provide an important entry point for \nunions into regional labour market policy, although inter-union competition does not allow for the \ndevelopment of a stable corporatist project (Horesnyi and T\u00f3th, 2006). \nThe significant differences in labour market institutions, dynamics and union capacities pose \nmajor questions for interregional labour market control, and thus for the objects and mechanisms of \ninterregional trade union cooperation. In the following sections, IRTUC activities regarding \ninformation and advice, company and sector-level cooperation as well as its social partner functions \nwill be discussed. \n \n \nInformation and advice beyond servicing \n \nThe starting point for IRTUC work to contain the adverse effects of the interregional labour market \nwas to act as a broker of information and point of advice for cross-border workers and trade unionists \nat sectoral and company levels. This provided a stepping stone to building horizontal cross-border \nnetworks at these levels and to develop IRTUC activities outside as well as within the workplace. \nBroadly we can distinguish between four different types of activities.  \nFirst, informing Hungarian as well as Austrian workers about their entitlements in wages, \nsupplements, benefits and working conditions as defined in collective agreements is seen as a basis for \nfighting wage dumping. In this process, the IRTUC has developed numerous bilingual brochures on \nemployment rights, tax and benefit matters, guides on the establishment and rights of works councils \nand collective bargaining, a dictionary on work and employment terminology, as well as a handbook \nfor transport workers on the regulations that apply in their sector (Grundtner and Eberl, 2006). It has \npicketed border crossings, reaching 800-1,000 cross-border workers. Furthermore, the IRTUC, with \nthe support of its sectoral unions, has organized social events for workers where topical work and \nemployment issues are discussed, drawing between 60-350 people per event; and has also supported \nStammtisch events, which take place more regularly, particularly in the transport, agriculture and \nservice sectors. Traditionally, a Stammtisch is a regular location in a pub which functions as a stage to \nplay cards or deliberate local gossip and politics; but in this case the Stammtisch framework is used \ninnovatively as a platform outside the workplace for information on work and employment issues in a \n 10 \ntrade union context. It is not coincidental that sectors dominated by small and medium-sized \nenterprises are at the forefront here. A Burgenland official from vida, the transport and services union, \nsaid in an interview: \n \nAfter the vocational training for lorry drivers, there was nothing\u2026 so we tried to get them \ntogether regularly to brush up on new regulations. I have seen this Stammtisch format \n[elsewhere] and I did not want to make the same mistake: talk about the union, the union, the \nunion; people jut get fed up with it. So we packed a lot of information into this and got speakers \nfrom the Ministry of Finance when they wanted to know about tax issues, the labour inspector, \ninspectors of foreign employment, people from the health and pension insurance. And when a \nlot of the labour market shifted abroad, then we obviously invited the Hungarians. \n \nInitially, according to an IRTUC\/\u00d6GB officer, \n \nAustrians and Hungarians looked at each other disparagingly, along the lines of \u2018this is who is \nresponsible for wage dumping in my sector, idiot, we\u2019ll show him\u2019. The interesting thing was \nthat the Hungarians asked questions and explained the pressures they are under, and then the \nAustrians realised it is not they who are responsible for wage dumping; that it is someone \ncompletely different and then the real power relations become apparent. In the end there was \nfraternization, they got the interpreters out of their boxes and then the lorry drivers started \ntalking amongst themselves. \n \nSecond, the creation of decentralized structures of support and advice played an important part \nin building the profile of the IRTUC. This was organized in conjunction with \u00d6GB legal secretaries at \nfederal and sectoral level, as well as the Arbeiterkammer (Chamber of Labour). Bilingual legal advice \nis offered regularly in five different locations across Burgenland, in the \u00d6GB district offices, and has \nassisted an increasing number of employees: 7,000 from March 2004 to September 2006; 3,800 alone \nin 2006. In 2004 \u00d6GB and MSzOSz concluded a membership recognition agreement so that the \u00d6GB \nnow represents Hungarian cross-border workers in the labour courts.  \nAs this advice and support are intended to prevent or redress the violation of cross-border \nworkers\u2019 terms and conditions of employment, the IRTUC, thirdly, has in this process been able to \nmonitor the labour market and to develop vast expertise on social insurance, labour and tax law as well \nas the various statutes and quotas under which foreign workers can be employed. The understanding \ngained here allowed it to identify and target specific problem sectors (advice was predominantly \nsought from employees in agriculture, transport, food production, pubs and restaurants) or specific \ngroups (seasonal harvesters, women, young and old workers), issues that were taken up again in the \nStammtisch events (interview, IRTUC\/\u00d6GB official).  \n 11 \nFourth, the IRTUC has increasingly developed a publicity, awareness-raising and lobbying \nfunction, both externally as well as within the labour movement. Information events and exposure of \nsevere employment rights violations have served to lobby public authorities and establish a good \npresence in the local media. This array of initiatives could only be developed and sustained with the \nactive involvement of sectoral unions and works councils (see below), thus offering avenues for cross-\nborder cooperation for the latter and raising their awareness for the specific problems of the opening \ninterregional labour market. Particularly where union organization is fragmented and weak, the \nIRTUC information events offer an important structure and function outside the workplace that unions \nare not able to fulfil, such as in Western Hungarian agriculture (interview, MSzOSz officer, Gy\u0151r-\nMoson-Sopron).  \nThus, while the emphasis of these initiatives was on individual cross-border workers, they \nbroadened established trade union practices and concerns, with the use of innovative formats such as \nthe Stammtisch. This made it possible to bring work, employment and trade union issues into social \nspaces outside the workplace, to target workers in the informal sector and to frame issues in terms of \nwork, employment and trade union rights, rather than as specific and separate concerns for Hungarian \ncross-border workers.  \n \n \nTrade union cooperation at sectoral and company levels \n \nTrade union cooperation at sectoral and company level has developed considerably and more \nsystematically through the involvement and the resources of the IRTUC. While the basis was laid \nthrough joint training for union officers and works councillors, the IRTUC aimed to develop structures \nof interest representation and build sustainable cross-border networks at sectoral level as well as \nbetween works councillors. Facilitating horizontal cross-border consultation and cooperation (as \nopposed to recourse through the formal channels of the national and regional unions) is central to the \nwork of the IRTUC, and has resulted in weekly contact, for example, between the railway unions as \nwell as in some other sectors and companies. However, cross-border cooperation at company level is \nhampered by the fragmentation and weak union presence in Hungarian workplaces. In this situation, \nthe Hungarian unions have used the IRTUC to bolster their legitimacy at sectoral level, trying to \nsubstitute for the gap at company level.  \nCooperation at sectoral level is mostly on the process of preparing bargaining claims and \nconducting negotiations, particularly in the metals, textiles and leather, commerce and transport, hotels \nand tourism and railway sectors. It is the training in collective bargaining that is central here rather \nthan actual bargaining cooperation; for example, Hungarian unionists have been observers in the \ncollective bargaining negotiations with the social insurance board and the retail sector in Vienna. In \n 12 \nthe other direction, Austrian unionists took part in the tripartite working commission for a sectoral \nagreement in construction and woodworking in Hungary (interview, IRTUC\/\u00d6GB official).  \nIn some sectors such as railways, because of the concentrated ownership structure (in other \nwords, the dominance of the former state-controlled railways) and well developed trade unions, \ninterregional meetings between unionists and works councillors have been established, meeting almost \nmonthly (interview, vida official). The conditions for this kind of cooperation (in contrast to the \nStammtisch) lie in the structure of the sector and the degree and capacity of union organization. In the \ncase of the railway unions, cooperation has become institutionalized and regularized independently of \nthe leadership of the IRTUC, and the networks and trust developed here have already been tested in \nstrike action. In 2003, for example, the \u00d6GB organized a strike against cutbacks in the pension system \nand noticed that management of the Austrian railways was preparing to use Hungarian train drivers to \nbreak the strike. However, good networks between the unions and the Hungarian train drivers\u2019 \nsolidarity ensured that all trains were stopped (Interview, \u00d6GB Burgenland official).  \nAt company level the aim was to build networks between works councillors in Austrian SMEs \nand their counterparts in Hungarian subsidiaries. A 2004 study by the IRTUC found around 380 \nAustrian employers in Gy\u0151r-Moson-Sopron, 320 in Vas and 350 in Zala, whereas there were only 20 \nHungarian enterprises or entrepreneurs in Burgenland (interview, MSzOSz official, Zala). The focus \nwas twofold: on Austrian companies in Burgenland with a high proportion of Hungarian workers on \nthe one hand, and on foreign (mainly Austrian) SME subsidiaries in Hungary on the other. In the first \ncase, the IRTUC has supported workplace representation of Hungarian workers; in the second, it is \nfacilitating company-level cross-border networks. Coordination of bargaining at company level offers \nanother important point of leverage where (mainly Austrian) companies have subsidiaries in Hungary. \nFor example, at Delphi Packard, an automotive supplier with factories within 20 km on either side of \nthe border, as well as Falco, a chipboard producer, efforts have been made to coordinate claims and \nprovisions on \u2018various social issues, non-wage benefits, procedures and benefits for laying off staff\u2019 \n(interviews, MSzOSz official, Vas and \u00d6GB Burgenland official). For union representatives in these \ncompanies, the technical and comparative information was considered very important, as were the \ncross-border networks as such:  \n \nWe have basic [cross-border] contact, cooperation is less continuous than issue-based, for \nexample about redundancies, wages, the relocation of production; when we have problems then \nwe get in touch with each other\u2026. The very fact that management knows that I attend IRTUC \nmeetings and now and then meet my opposite number in [Burgenland], this is a great advantage. \n\u2018Why, what did you do there?\u2019 --- they don\u2019t like that very much (interview, Liga official, Delhi \nPackard) \n \n 13 \nWe don\u2019t speak about wages.\u2026 What is more important are techniques of bargaining, because \nwhen you go in and say the company\u2019s profits are such and such, they just say get lost and don\u2019t \neven speak to us; but when we prepare the negotiations well, for example with rates of inflation \netc., that is very helpful (interview, MSzOSz official, Falco) \n \nIt has proved extremely difficult to establish workplace representation in Hungary with the help \nof cross-border networks. One interviewee mentioned cases where Austrian and Hungarian unions \noffered information and advice at workplace assemblies on how to set up works council \nrepresentation, yet local workers did not take any action. While \u00d6GB and IRTUC practices are \nconsidered good templates, the very different context in Hungary often renders them inadequate. This \nis highlighted, for example, through the way information events were organized outside the \nworkplace: \n \nIn those companies where we do not have access, legally, our only option is to organize so-\ncalled open-day information events [but only] 3 percent of these infodays were successful.\u2026 \nVery few have realised this, that it would be good to organize a union, very few, only 3 percent. \nStill, until the workers themselves realise that this is beneficial, this won\u2019t change. We have \nmany good ideas, have brought out publications and brochures, but that does not get across. \n(interview, MSzOSz official, Vas)  \n \nIn other cases, union or works council representation exists in Hungarian subsidiaries but the \nemployer refuses to negotiate a collective agreement (for example at Eybl International, which makes \ntextile products for the automotive industry). In such cases, the Austrian industry union can try to put \npressure on the home-country management (interview, MSzOSz official, Vas). Lack of capacity at the \nworkplace, however, leads local officers to rule-of-thumb bargaining rather than informed wage \nclaims. Also, competitive unionism in Hungary can make cross-border cooperation more difficult. \nEfforts to establish cooperation in Delphi Packard, for example, had to overcome initial reservations \nbetween the main regional player (MSzOSz) and the dominant union at company level (Liga) \n(interview, MSzOSz official, Vas).  \nThe weakness of Hungarian labour results in a circle of \u2018strategic displacement\u2019: while thin \nworkplace presence makes county and regional unions focus on corporatist involvement and the (hard \nto achieve) sectoral social dialogue, efficient implementation of the latter requires workplace presence. \nThus, industry level fora and cooperation activities under IRTUC auspices substitute for weak \nindigenous structures.  \n \n \n 14 \nThe IRTUC as social partner \n \nAnother function that is central to IRTUC activities is its role as a social partner. Where labour market \ncontrol and unionization are relatively high, as is the case in Burgenland, the social partner function at \nregional level ensures a link between workplace presence and labour market policies; where the \nformer are weak as in Western Hungary, social partner involvement in labour market policies \nsubstitutes for collective power.  \n A number of interregional networks between social partners have been built around policy-\nmaking and implementation, particularly regarding the specific category of cross-border commuters. \nRegular contacts have been developed not only with the regional trade union confederations and \nchambers of labour but also with the public employment service, the health, occupational injury and \npension insurance boards, the Austrian inspectorates for foreign employment and forestry, the \nHungarian County Labour Councils and development councils, as well as a number of training \ninstitutions on both sides of the border. This has allowed the IRTUC to develop considerable technical \nexpertise in social and labour market monitoring and to acquire an important voice in a number of \ninstitutions dealing with the interregional labour market. The most important institution in this respect \nis the international joint commission on cross-border commuters which decides on quotas for the latter \nas well as job placements. \n \nWe can say that we are in almost daily contact with our partners, and there are certain issues \nwhere the labour market organizations are forced to consult each other. There are regional \nagreements on cross-border commuters, students on job placements etc. All counties, as well as \nthe regional public employment office, have tried to build their own contacts. (interview, \nMSzOSz official, Gy\u0151r-Moson-Sopron) \n \nFurther, the IRTUC is consulted through the \u00d6GB Burgenland by the public employment office \non the allocation of work permits or the development of a \u2018blacklist\u2019 of agricultural establishments that \nhave not complied with labour law, resulting in fewer or no work permits for those enterprises \n(\u00d6GB\/IGR, n.d.). One interviewee held that \u2018the experience and expertise of the IRTUC is reflected in \nthe decisions of the advisory board of the public employment office\u2019 (interview, IRTUC official). This \nmonitoring of labour market trends and quotas was also important as the basis for the decision (in fact \nthe \u00d6GB\u2019s veto) not to open the labour market in 2007; instead, a flexible quota system for skilled \nworkers was introduced in 2007 and expanded in 2008 (from 3 to 50 occupations or professions not \nsubject to a quota).  \nThe Euroregion provides an additional framework for trade unions\u2019 engagement as social \npartners, particularly as it overlaps exactly with the IRTUC labour market. However, despite parallel \nstructures in the Euroregion and the IRTUC, the unions\u2019 representation in the former is through their \n 15 \nnational channels. Thus, instead of being directly involved in social affairs, business, development and \ntraining, as was initially hoped (interview, MSzOSz official, Vas), the IRTUC is not represented as \nsuch in the Euroregion. The same goes for an interregional employment pact that was concluded in \nJune 2007 between the Austrian and Hungarian regional governments. Again, the regional unions are \ninvolved through the social partner arrangements in their respective countries, although employee-\nrelated activities of the pact can be integrated with existing IRTUC activities (Verein Dialog, 2007; \ninterviews, MSzOSz officials, Vas and Gy\u0151r-Moson-Sopron).  \n Having built up an extensive system of information and interest representation, the IRTUC has \nbecome an important interregional network broker between trade unions and government institutions, \nand has gradually expanded its role from core labour market issues to social policy and training \n(Gutknecht-Gmeiner and Henkel, 2005; \u00d6GB\/IGR, n.d.). Although this social partner role functions \nthrough different corporatist dynamics at national level, involvement in the policy community of the \nEuroregion has certainly been a factor in advancing important elements of the interregional labour \nmarket (legal representation, benefits and tax regulations for cross-border workers, employment \nservice in the regions as well as in the context of EURES-T, vocational education and training, \nallocation of labour market funds) (interview, MSzOSz official, Falco). Furthermore, the social partner \nfunction has raised the political profile of the regional trade unions, that is the traditional social \npartnership role of the \u00d6GB Burgenland as well as the very weak regional structures of MSzOSz. \nFinally, it places regional trade unions into the multi-level system of European politics, that is into EU \ncohesion policies as well as within ETUC structures. However, given the structural incongruence \nbetween the two industrial relations systems (sectoral collective bargaining vs. patchy company-level \nbargaining), cross-border trade union cooperation remains focused on bottom-up initiatives to increase \nlabour market control, through networking, coordination and capacity building.   \n \n \nTrade union cooperation under asymmetry \n \nThe function of trade union cooperation at the (sub-national) interregional level is to protect minimum \nwages and social standards in cross-border regions marked by considerable disparities. In the absence \nof product market control or a role in wage bargaining, it is the social function of trade union \ncooperation --- the preservation of minimum wage levels, benefits and labour rights, particularly in \nsectors with strong precarious employment --- that is crucial in cross-border regions. This is even more \npronounced where economic and social disparities come with considerable differences in the strength \nof industrial relations systems and trade union capacity: here, bottom-up strategies of labour market \ncontrol are much more central than they would be between regions with high collective bargaining \ncoverage. Yet, in the context of competitive regionalism, cooperation on cross-border labour market \nissues does not necessarily result in a balanced approach to reduce economic and social differentials. \n 16 \nWhile \u2018East-West-IRTUCs\u2019, in particular suffer from pronounced asymmetries, each case needs to be \nanalysed separately as to what strategies of labour market control and capacity building are employed, \nthe way in which different industrial relations institutions, interests and resources are shaped into new \nforms of cooperation that engage workers and establish more permanent forms of representation. The \nstrategic orientation, trade union capacity and (in most cases) the bridging of the East-West gap are \ncentral themes in this respect.  \nFirst, the institutionalization and differentiation of IRTUC strategies ranges from a network \nnode, a resource for campaigning and building trade union capacity, a platform to organize cross-\nborder company- and sector-level networks, to an interregional social partner function (ETUC, 2009; \nM\u00fcller, 1994; Noack, 2001). The strategic compromise on these orientations is influenced by the role \nof regional labour movements and the kind of interregional cooperation that is possible across \ncontrasting systems of industrial relations and labour market regulation. At interregional level, this \ncompromise can be located in the triangle of state, market and society developed by Hyman (2001).  \nSecond, with regard to capacity, the challenge lies in developing forms of cooperation that go \nbeyond unilateral defensive measures on one side of the border and aim to build labour capacity \nthroughout the cross-border region. For example, weak trade union capacity in Hungary has crucial \nimplications for strategies of cross-border cooperation, which becomes most evident in the following \ndilemma. Neumann has argued that \u2018many company agreements are far from being real negotiated \nagreements, but are either defined unilaterally by employers or, following state socialist traditions, \nsimply repeat the law\u2019 (2002:12). Weak workplace organization is further complicated by inter-union \ncompetition as well as a duplication of employee representation between works councils and unions \n(T\u00f3th, 2000). On the other hand, multi-employer sectoral bargaining has also failed to develop into \nsustainable practices. Even though Hungarian trade unionists aim to emulate the corporatist Austrian \napproach, any replication in a different societal context is bound to be extremely problematic. Thus, \ndifferent institutions and strategic capacities largely delimit the constraints (as well as the challenges) \nof cross-border trade union cooperation in general: while it takes workplace organization in order to \nstrengthen sectoral and regional unions, it takes strong unions at the sectoral and regional levels in \norder to organize workplaces.  \nFinally, economic disparities and differences in organizational capacity influence the quality \nof cross-border cooperation that is possible. Unless the asymmetry in trade union capacity is \naddressed, cross-border cooperation will find its limits in protecting minimum wages and terms of \nemployment for workers on the Austrian side, thereby protecting the asymmetry rather becoming an \nactor in shaping labour market convergence. L\u00e9vesque and Murray (2007) argue that a combination of \ntop-down and bottom-up approaches is best suited to articulate contending needs across different \nlevels and borders. In this respect, the IRTUC West Pannonia has developed the Stammtisch format to \ncreate important informational and social network capacity, for union representatives as well as \nworkers. At the sectoral and company levels, cooperation is contingent on the existence of union \n 17 \norganization on the Hungarian side. The social partner role is where the IRTUC has been most \nbeneficial for Hungarian unions, as it clearly raises their political profile in tripartite regional labour \nmarket institutions. Through such initiatives the IRTUC has helped to build organizational capacity --- \narticulate different union levels across the border and train\/socialize a new generation of trade \nunionists --- in a very difficult phase of transition. The bottom-up focus on labour market control in \nthese forms of cross-border cooperation can assist trade union revival in Eastern Europe (Ost, 2009); it \nmight also gain in importance in the context of the decentralization of bargaining (Traxler et al., 2008: \n234) and competitive regional development. However, the quality of cooperation is crucial here, as is \nthe articulation of workplace, industry and national strategies. \n \n \nAcknowledgements \nI am grateful to the IRTUC, \u00d6GB, MSzOSz and Liga representatives for granting me time, Eszter \nT\u00f3th and Eva M\u00fcller for facilitating contacts, Attila Kelemen for translation.
