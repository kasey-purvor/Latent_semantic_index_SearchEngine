Introduction\n[2] Much recent interest in the dynamics of the North\nAtlantic\u2019s meridional overturning circulation (MOC) has\nbeen stimulated by modeling studies which have suggested\nthat a collapse of the MOC would result in a dramatic change\nin the Northern Hemisphere climate [Manabe and Stouffer,\n1999;Vellinga andWood, 2002;Wood et al., 2003]; a concern\nstrengthened by evidence that such changes have occurred in\nthe past [McManus et al., 2004]. Within an ocean model, at\nleast, the time-mean MOC is easily visualized by computing\nthe stream function of the zonally integrated mean transport\nas a function of depth and latitude (see Figure 1). However,\ndue to a paucity of suitable observations, a similar charac-\nterization of the physical MOC is not so easily obtained, but\nthose studies that have been done, seem to confirm, at least\nqualitatively, the ability of numerical ocean models to repro-\nduce the present, steady state MOC [Ganachaud and\nWunsch, 2003; Talley et al., 2003].\n[3] While there is still much debate concerning the driving\nforce that maintains the steady state of the MOC, it is more\ncertain that deep water formation through convection in the\nsubpolar North Atlantic and Nordic Seas plays a critical role\nin supplying mass, if not energy, to the overturning circu-\nlation (see review paper by Kuhlbrodt et al. [2007]). Vari-\nability of the MOC has been linked to changes in the rate of\ndeep water formation, with some finding convection in the\nLabrador Sea of primary importance [Marsh, 2000; Cooper\nand Gordon, 2002; Latif et al., 2006], and others finding the\nNordic Seas the greater contributor to MOC variability\n[Gerdes and Ko\u00a8berle, 1995; Koltermann et al., 1999; Ko\u00a8hl\nand Stammer, 2008; Guemas and Salas-Me\u00b4lia, 2008;\nDeshayes and Frankignoul, 2008]. In turn, the changes in\ndeep water formation rate through convection have been\nlinked to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) [Mauritzen\nandHakkinen, 1999;Hakkinen, 2001;Curry andMcCartney,\n2001; Eden and Jung, 2001; Eden and Willebrand, 2001;\nEsselborn, 2001; Cheng et al., 2004], which, in its more\nvigorous state, deepens the mixed layer and promotes con-\nvection through enhanced cooling and mixing. Alternatively,\nMauritzen and Hakkinen [1999], while also finding a link\nbetween the NAO and MOC, propose that this occurs largely\nthrough changes in the volume of water classes, due to the\nentrainment of thermocline waters by the dense overflows at\nthe Greenland-Scotland ridge. There is also some debate as to\nwhether the ocean, and in particular the MOC, responds\npassively to the NAO or plays an active role as suggested by\nEden and Greatbatch [2003]. Additionally, Spall [2008]\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 114, C12029, doi:10.1029\/2009JC005492, 2009\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1Department of Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Newcastle\nUniversity, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.\n2Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory, Liverpool, UK.\nCopyright 2009 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/09\/2009JC005492$09.00\nC12029 1 of 17\nconcludes that low-frequency MOC variability can be gen-\nerated by many factors other than buoyancy fluxes, including\nlateral advection, acting on the baroclinic pressure gradient in\nthe mixed layer. Moreover, it has been suggested that MOC\nvariability can be generated internally, with no external atmo-\nspheric forcing, through the interaction of horizontal pres-\nsure gradients and the ocean circulation [Zhu and Jungclaus,\n2008].\n[4] The MOC is generally conceived of as a large-scale\nfeature of the ocean\u2019s circulation, as exemplified by the\nstream function in Figure 1, and the phrase MOC variability\nis suggestive of meridionally coherent variability of this\nlarge-scale feature. Clearly, due to mass conservation, on\nsome time scale this must be the case. In fact, simple models\npredict that meridional adjustment to the rate of deep water\nformation at high latitudes occurs rapidly through southward\npropagating coastally trapped waves [e.g., Kawase, 1987;\nJohnson and Marshall, 2002], supporting the notion of a\nmeridionally coherent entity, at all but the shortest time\nscales. However, in a range of sophisticated numerical\nmodels [Bingham et al., 2007] found that much of the zonally\nintegrated meridional transport variability (henceforth, often\nabbreviated to transport variability) at any particular latitude\nis localized and only weakly correlated with the transport\nvariability at other latitudes, even for interannual variability.\nFurthermore, both Sime et al. [2006] and Cabanes et al.\n[2008] describe how the factors driving transport variability\nare latitudinally dependent. This apparent discrepancy can\nperhaps be resolved by thinking of the transport variability at\nany particular latitude as being the sum of a meridionally\ncoherent mode (of the sort evoked by the phrase MOC\nvariability) and locally generated, meridionally incoherent\nvariability.\n[5] Because these two components of transport variability\nare not readily separated, in this study, rather than attempting\nto explainMOC variability as part of a large-scale system, we\nshall restrict ourselves to understanding the total transport\nvariability at a single latitude. However, we focus on 50\u0002N,\nwhich, from our previous work, appears gives the clearest\npicture of low-frequency meridionally coherent transport\nvariability [Bingham et al., 2007]. We take as our starting\npoint the geostrophic balance that is known to hold between\nthe zonally integrated meridional transport and the east-west\npressure difference across the basin. Confirming a result from\nour earlier work [Bingham and Hughes, 2008] we find that\nmuch of the transport variability at 50\u0002N in HadCM3 can\nbe recovered from pressure on the western boundary. Pre-\nviously, we have used this to show how the MOC could\npotentially be monitored using measurements from the west-\nern boundary. Here, however, our primary objective is to\nshow that it is to the western boundary that we must look if\nwe are to understand the proximate mechanism of transport\nvariability at 50\u0002N. We find that the western boundary\npressure arises locally from changes in the density field over\nthe continental slope. Given that 50\u0002N intersects the subpolar\ngyre, and knowing that deep water formation occurs in the\nwestern part of the basin, it is not surprising that we find such\ndensity anomalies on the western boundary. However, that\nthese density variations lead to the bottom pressure signal\nfrom which we can determine the transport variability is a\nsurprising result.\n[6] In section 2 we show how the temporal variability of\nthe meridional transport can be decomposed in such a fashion\nthat its calculation only depends on relative, rather than\nabsolute, sea level. This is important due to difficulties with\nthe diagnosis of sea level from the HadCM3 model. Brief\ndescriptions of the models used are provided in section 3. In\nsection 4 we give a qualitative account of the transport\nvariability at 50\u0002N in HadCM3, followed by a demonstration\nof the geostrophic calculation and an examination of the\nfields fromwhich the transport variability is determined. This\nis supplemented by an examination of the same fields in the\nhigher-resolution Ocean Circulation and Climate Advanced\nModelling project (OCCAM) model in section 5. In section 6\nwe propose a mechanism to explain how density varia-\ntions lead to the required bottom pressure signal. Finally,\nin section 7, our results are discussed, and conclusions are\nprovided.\n2. Decomposition of the Meridional Transport\n[7] According to geostrophy, in the absence of intervening\ntopography, at each latitude the zonal integral of the merid-\nional transport as a function of depth is given by\nT z\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc p\nb\ne z\u00f0 \u00de \u0002 pbw z\u00f0 \u00de\nr0f0\n; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere pe\nb(z) and pw\nb (z) are the bottom pressures on the eastern\nand western boundaries of the basin, r0 is the mean density\nof seawater, and f0 is the Coriolis parameter. (For a more\ncomplete justification of equation (1) seeBingham andHughes\n[2008].) Equation (1) can be used to compute the absolute\ntransport given the absolute pressure field. However, here\nwe are concerned with transport variability, and so it can\nbe assumed that the time mean has been removed from the\npressures, and T is the anomalous transport. Here z is posi-\ntive out of the ocean and z = 0 corresponds to position of the\ntime-mean sea surface.\n[8] The basin boundaries are, of course, formed by the\ncontinental slopes. Because these have finite gradients, over\nthe slopes, quantities, such as sea level and bottom pressure,\nwhich are more usually thought of as varying with lateral\nFigure 1.

For a\nzonally dependent field F(x) (we ignore meridional depen-\ndence, since we are considering a fixed latitude), we use the\nnotation Fe,w(z) \u0003 F(x = xe,w(z)) to indicate the value of F at\nthe zonal position x = xe,w(z) on the eastern (subscript e) and\nwestern (subscript w) boundaries corresponding to depth z.\n[9] Equation (1) assumes no intervening topography. Yet,\nat 50\u0002N the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) shoals at a depth of\n2800 m. Potentially, therefore, at this latitude the geostrophic\ntransport calculation at depths below 2800 m may need to\ntake into account the pressure on the flanks of the MAR, and\nthe transport below 2800 m would then be given by the sum\nof the pressure difference between the eastern boundary and\nthe eastern flank of theMAR and pressure difference between\nthe western boundary and the western flank of the MAR.\nHowever, it will be shown below that neglect of theMAR has\nno significant effect on the transport calculation at the time\nscales of interest here. The reasons for this are described by\nBingham and Hughes [2008].\n[10] Assuming hydrostatic balance, the bottom pressure on\nthe boundaries is given by\npbe;w z\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc gr0 he;w \u0002 hse;w\n\u0002 \u0003\n; \u00f02\u00de\nwhere he,w is anomalous sea level (relative to the time-mean\nsea surface) at the eastern and western boundary points, g is\nthe acceleration due to gravity, and\nhse;w \u00bc \u0002\nZ 0\nz\nre;w z\n0\u00f0 \u00de=r0dz0 \u00f03\u00de\nis the steric component of the anomalous sea level resulting\nfrom the anomalous density field re,w (the absolute density\nminus its time mean) over the depth of the water column at\nthe boundary points. Substitution into equation (1) leads to\nT z\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc g he \u0002 hse\n\u0004 \u0005\u0002 hw \u0002 hsw\u0004 \u0005\u0006 \u0007=f0: \u00f04\u00de\n[11] For this analysis it is useful to decompose the merid-\nional transport into a depth-mean component T and a depth-\ndependent component T^ , and to further decompose each of\nthese into eastern andwestern boundary components (although,\nthis does not imply that the actual flow is on either the eastern\nor western boundary, only that this is where the quantities in\nthe calculation are located). Thus, we have\nT \u00bc Te \u0002 Tw\n\u0004 \u0005\u00fe T^ e \u0002 T^w\u0004 \u0005: \u00f05\u00de\nThe depth-mean components are given by\nTe;w \u00bc g he;w \u0002 hse;w\n\u0002 \u0003\n=f0; \u00f06\u00de\nwhere\nhe;w \u00bc\n1\nHmax\nZ 0\n\u0002Hmax\nhe;wdz \u00f07\u00de\nis the depth mean of sea level over the boundary, and sim-\nilarly for he,w\ns . Hmax is the depth at the bottom of the slope.\nFinally, the depth-dependent components of the meridional\ntransport are given by\nT^ e;w \u00bc g h^e;w \u0002 h^se;w\n\u0002 \u0003\n=f0 \u00f08\u00de\nwhere h^e,w = he,w \u0002 he,w and similarly for h^e,ws .\n[12] As Bingham and Hughes [2008] show, the depth-\nindependent component of the meridional transport is dom-\ninated by the geostrophic compensation of the Ekman trans-\nport. The dynamics of this are relatively well understood,\nand, in an observational context, this component could be\nrecovered from the wind stress. Therefore, our focus in this\npaper is the dynamics of the depth-dependent component of\nthe meridional transport. The above derivations show that\nthis does not depend of the absolute value of sea level at either\nboundary, only on its zonal variation over the lateral ranges\nspanned by the boundaries. This is important for the present\nstudy using HadCM3 since, as described in the appendix, it is\nonly possible to determine the relative value of sea level, not\nthe absolute value, with sufficient accuracy for use in the\ngeostrophic calculation.\n3. Models\n[13] The results of this paper are based on two quite\ndifferent numerical models. The first is the Hadley Centre\ncoupled atmosphere-ocean model HadCM3, which simulates\na realistic and stable present-day mean climate without the\nneed of unphysical flux adjustments required in many cou-\npled models in order to prevent climate drift [Gordon et al.,\n2000]. The atmospheric component of HadCM3 has a reso-\nlution of 2.5\u0002 in latitude and 3.75\u0002 in longitude, and has\n19 vertical levels. The oceanic component has a horizontal\nresolution of 1.25\u0002 in both latitude and longitude, and has\n20 depth levels, which vary in thickness from 10 m near the\nsurface to 500 m at the bottom. Here we examine a 100 year\nsection (years 2079\u20132178) from a control run of HadCM3\nwith preindustrial atmospheric conditions. For this run, the\nmodel was initialized from the climatology of Levitus [Levitus\net al., 1994; Levitus and Boyer, 1994], with a spin-up period\nof 360 years.\n[14] The second model is the eddy-permitting Ocean\nCirculation and Climate Advanced Modeling project\nmodel (OCCAM), run at the National Oceanography Centre,\nSouthampton. OCCAM is a z coordinate, global, free surface\nmodel with a rotated grid over the North Atlantic, forced with\n6 hourly ECMWF atmospheric data. The run we are consid-\nering (run 202) is at 0.25\u0002 resolution, with 66 vertical levels,\nover the 19 year period 1985\u20132003, after 4 years of spin-up\n[Coward and de Cuevas, 2005].\n[15] In this study we are concerned with interannual\nvariability. For the analyzed model output, this component\nhas been extracted by removal of the mean seasonal cycle and\nthe application of a 13 month boxcar filter. Henceforth, to\nsave repetition, in all references to variability, it can be\nassumed that we mean interannual variability.\n4. Meridional Transport in HadCM3\n4.1. Descriptive Account\n[16] We begin with a descriptive account of the zonally\nintegratedmeridional transport variability at 50\u0002N inHadCM3.\nC12029 BINGHAM AND HUGHES: GEOSTROPHIC MOC DYNAMICS\n3 of 17\nC12029\nFigure 2a shows that, unlike the time-mean transport (as\nillustrated in Figure 1), the transport variability cannot be\nneatly partitioned into discrete opposing layers. However, we\ncan identify two prominent events, roughly between years 20\nand 30, and years 55 and 65, where the northward transport\nincreases by several sverdrups above 1800 m, while below\nthere is a corresponding increase in southward transport.\nWe therefore take the integral of the transport over the\ndepth range 100\u20131800 m (which we shall denote by TU) as\nan index of the transport variability at this latitude (Figure 2c,\nred). This shows that for the two prominent events the in-\ncrease in transport strength is about 4.5 Sv over a period of\n10 years.\n[17] To see how the transport variability at 50\u0002N is related\nto the variability at other latitudes, we calculate normalized\nempirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) from the zonally\nintegrated meridional transport as a function of latitude and\ndepth. The leading EOF (Figures 2b and 2c, blue) demon-\nstrates that the transport variability at 50\u0002N is part of a larger-\nscale coherent pattern of variability that extends over the\nentire meridional extent of the North Atlantic basin. This\nmode is the dominant component north of about 40\u0002N,\nexplaining a large fraction of the variance in this region.\nSouth of 40\u0002N it accounts for much less of the variance above\n2000 m (because as Bingham et al. [2007] show, higher-\nfrequency variability is greater here). Yet, it remains the\ndominant feature in the deeper ocean. Note that some of\nthe more short-term fluctuations at 50\u0002N do not appear in the\ntemporal function of EOF1, indicative of their more localized\nnature. The two prominent events, however, do appear in the\ntemporal function, showing that they reflect large-scale\nchanges in the North Atlantic MOC.\n4.2. Geostrophic Calculation\n[18] Above we showed how the transport variability can be\npartitioned into east and west informational components.\nHere we perform the described calculations using the model\ndata at 50\u0002N. There are two reasons that motivate us in this\nregard: First, from a practical, observational perspective, it\nprovides some insight regarding successful strategies for mon-\nitoring theMOC, the object of ongoing efforts. Secondly, and\nperhaps more importantly, it points us in the direction we\nshould look if we wish to understand the underlying dynam-\nics of the transport variability. As we see directly below, it is\nto the western boundarywe should look in both regards. Later\nit will be shown that it is the nature of the density variations\non the western slope that are the proximate cause of the west-\nern boundary pressure variations from which we can recover\nmuch of the transport variability at 50\u0002N.\n[19] For the OCCAMmodel, Bingham and Hughes [2008]\nshow that bottom pressure from the western boundary is\nsufficient to determine the transport variability at 42\u0002N.\nFigures 3 and 4 show, in much the same way as we did for\nOCCAM, the results of a similar geostrophic calculation of\nthe transport variability at 50\u0002N in HadCM3. Comparing\nFigure 3a with the directly integrated transport (Figure 2a)\nshows that the geostrophic calculation using both east and\nwest boundary pressures is successful in recovering most of\nthe transport variability in HadCM3 at 50\u0002N. This is con-\nfirmed in Figure 3b, which shows the difference between the\ngeostrophically and directly computed transports. However,\nthe fact that the residual is nonzero shows the determination\nis not entirely successful. In part, this is due to the numerics\nof the calculation, which involve interpolation and finite\ndifferences. It is also due to the fact that we have, as discussed\nabove, neglected any pressure differences resulting from\nthe intervening topography. Figure 4a, which shows the\ndepth integral of the meridional transport over the upper\nlayer defined earlier, summarizes the accuracy of the geo-\nstrophic calculation. The correlation of the geostrophically\ncomputed time series with the directly determined time\nseries, TU, is 0.91, and accounts for 82% of the total variance\nin TU.\nFigure 2.

In particular, we find that the two large\ntransport fluctuations are well determined from the western\nboundary pressure. For the upper layer time series (Figure 4b)\nthe correlation with TU is 0.94 and the skill (percent of\nvariance accounted for) is 88%. In contrast to the western\nboundary, very little of the transport variability at 50\u0002N can\nbe recovered using only the eastern boundary pressure (see\nFigures 3e, 3f, and 4c). When we omit the pressure on this\nboundary from the geostrophic calculation we do lose part of\nthe meridional transport variability in the upper 1300. But\nthis is a relatively small fraction of the total transport, and the\nresult of the EOF analysis given above suggests that it is quite\nlocalized, and not part of the basin-scale coherent mode\ncaptured by the western boundary component.\n[21] Some insight into these results can be gained from\nan examination of the fields involved in the geostrophic\ncalculation, namely sea level h, steric height hs, and, the dif-\nference between these two, bottom pressure pb (when ex-\npressed, as it will be throughout this paper, as an equivalent\nthickness of seawater h = pb\/gr0). Considering first the\nvariability on the western boundary, we see the two most\nprominent fluctuations are clearly manifest in the Hovmo\u00a8ller\nplot of bottom pressure (Figure 5a). As the transport increases\nin strength near the end of the second decade, and again near\nthe end of the fifth decade, we see that the bottom pressure\ngoes from positive to negative above the 1800 m isobath and\nfrom negative to positive below 1800 m. The relationship\nis clearly consistent with the geostrophic balance given by\nequation (1).\nFigure 3.

This is\nin stark contrast to the sea level and steric height fields\n(Figures 5b and 5c), from which bottom pressure is obtained.\nThese fields show much more interannual variability, and, at\nfirst sight, do not show a clear relationship with the two large\ntransport fluctuations. Sea level variability is dominated by\nsteric height changes, and the steric variability is not obvi-\nously related to the transport strength. This is because much\nof the steric height variability, particularly toward the higher\nfrequencies, is due to density changes in the upper several\nhundred meters, whereas the large transport fluctuations\ndepend on changes in density that reach much deeper in the\nwater column.\n[23] We now employ the method of compositing to reveal\nthe relationship between each of the three fields and the\ntransport strength as represented by the time series TU. A\nhigh composite of a field F relative to a time series F is the\nmean of F for all times when F is greater than some arbitrary\nthreshold value F0. The corresponding low composite is the\nmean of F for all times when F is less than \u0002F0. (Later we\nrefer to high-low composites. These are formed simply by\nsubtracting the low composite from the high composite.) If\nthe time series is of sufficient length, variability unrelated to\nthe process characterized by the reference time series can be\naveraged out, thus revealing any relationship between the\ncomposited field and the process of interest.\n[24] Here we use a threshold value of 1 Sv. The high\nand low composites of the fields over the western boundary\nare shown in Figures 6a and 6c. The bottom pressure com-\nposites (red) confirm the relationship already apparent in the\nHovmo\u00a8ller plot: Enhanced transport variability is associated\nwith a shoreward decrease in bottom pressure and an increase\non the lower part of the continental slope, which gradually\nfalls to zero toward the deep ocean. The opposite situation\noccurs when the transport is relatively weak. The steric height\nfield (blue) shows the opposite relationship with the transport\nstrength. A sizeable negative gradient arises in association\nwith a more vigorous transport. In contrast to both the bottom\npressure and steric height fields, the sea surface height com-\nposites (green) do not develop strong gradients in association\nwith strong or weak states of the transport. This is telling,\ngiven that the sea level is, in general, dominated by steric\nheight variability. It suggests that the sea level height gradi-\nent produced by the density field is not sustainable, and so\nthere is an adjustment that acts to flatten the sea surface. This\npoint will be significant for our discussion of the dynamics in\nsection 6.\n[25] To highlight the different natures of the variability on\nthe eastern andwestern boundaries, we now consider the high\nand low composites on the eastern boundary (Figures 6b and\n6d). The magnitude of the bottom pressure variability here is\ngenerally greater than on the western boundary. Comparison\nwith Figure 3e confirms that this pressure variability corre-\nsponds to the shallower component of the meridional trans-\nport, lost when we neglect the eastern boundary. However, as\ndiscussed previously, this component appears to be localized,\nand not representative of the more significant, meridionally\ncoherent component of the transport, as revealed by the EOF\nanalysis. As on the western boundary, the pressure variations\non the eastern boundary appear to result from an adjustment\nof the sea surface to eliminate the gradient across the slope\nthat would result from the steric height alone. This is clear in\nthe eastern boundary composites (Figures 6b and 6d), where\nwe see how the sea level is primarily steric east of 14.5\u0002W, but\nto the west the steric height drops while the sea level flattens\nout. This difference manifests itself as the observed bottom\npressure signal.\n[26] Since these eastern boundary composites are based\non TU, which, recall, is well determined from the western\nboundary pressure, it would appear there is some relationship\nbetween the pressure on the two boundaries. Figures 7 and\n8 set the variability at the boundaries in the wider context of\nFigure 4.

As expected, the basin\nwide sea level variability is dominated by steric processes,\nwith bottom pressure generally small in comparison. Unlike\nsea level, bottom pressure displays a close relationship with\nthe basin topography, with the largest bottom pressure\nvariations occurring at the boundaries, and, to a lesser extent,\nat other features of the midocean topography. Two character-\nistics of the steric component of the sea level stand out: First,\nthere is the long period, out of phase behavior between the\nwestern and eastern halves of the basin: While the eastern\nbasin is warmer, the western basin is cooler, and vice versa.\nSecond, superimposed on this are apparently eastward prop-\nagating anomalies, which appear to cross the basin in ap-\nproximately four years. Presumably these represent density,\nprimarily temperature, anomalies advected in the mean cir-\nculation. Note that we do not see in these plots much evidence\nfor westward propagation such as might arise from Rossby\nwaves. This is to be expected at high latitudes.\n[27] The tendency of the basin to be zonally anticorrelated\nhelps explain the apparent relationship between the pressures\non the eastern and western boundaries. The density compos-\nite (Figure 8d) shows that during times of more vigorous\noverturning the eastern half of the basin is generally warmer\nand less dense, while the opposite is true of the western half of\nthe basin. This is consistent with more relatively warm water\ncoming from the south and enhanced cooling in the western\nsubpolar basin. The anomalous density structure explains the\nform of the steric height and sea level composites (although\nnotice somewhat of an asymmetry between the high and low\ncomposites with the east-west difference more pronounced\nin the case of the high composite.) As will be discussed in\nsection 6, on the western boundary, the positive density\nFigure 5.

On\nthe eastern boundary the opposite occurs. The steric anomaly\n(again for the high composite) rapidly decreases toward the\ncoast, although note that in this case the density anomaly does\nnot meet the topography as it does on the west. As a result,\nthere is a smaller change in steric height over the topography,\nand consequently, a much smaller eastern boundary pressure\nchange and associated transport variation. The pressure\nvariability that does arise is due to the density anomaly that\nseems trapped near the surface against the eastern bound-\nary and the strong steric height gradient it produces. This is\nclear in comparing the composites, and is apparent in the\nHovmo\u00a8ller diagram by the tendency of the sea level and steric\nheight close to the coast to take the opposite sign to the\ninterior.\n5. High-Resolution Model Analysis\n[28] Determining an underlying mechanism for the trans-\nport variability at 50\u0002N in HadCM3 is somewhat hampered\nby the low resolution of the model. Toward this end, we now\nturn to the OCCAM model, which has much higher resolu-\ntion in both the horizontal and vertical directions. Figure 9\nshows, that at 50\u0002N in OCCAM, as in HadCM3, the primary\ndeterminant of meridional transport variability is the western\nboundary pressure. The skill of the transport calculation for\nthe upper and lower layers using only western boundary\npressure is 94%. And the standard deviation of the difference\nbetween the directly computed time series and the time series\ncalculated from the western boundary pressure is 0.39 Sv for\nboth the upper and lower layer transports. (For the unfiltered\ncase the skill and standard errors scores for the upper layer are\n74% and 0.93 Sv and for the lower layer they are 57% and\n1.63 Sv. The reasons for this degradation are as for 42\u0002N, as\ndiscussed by Bingham and Hughes [2008].\n[29] Using high-low composites, we find, as in HadCM3,\nthat associated with a strengthened meridional transport at\n50\u0002N, there is a significant increase in density, reaching a\ndepth of 2500 m on the western slope (see Figure 10a and an\nenlargement of the western boundary region in 10b; this\nenlargement is repeated for each of the rows in Figure 10).\nThe anomalous density increase also extends onto the shelf\nand into the basin to 35\u0002W, but with much less penetration. A\nsimilar composite of temperature (not shown) reveals that\nthis density change is due to cooling of the water column. In\ncontrast, on the eastern boundary there is very little anoma-\nlous density signal.\n[30] Corresponding to the change in the density field, we\nalso expect to see a change in sea level. High-low composites\nof sea level, steric height and bottom pressure, are shown in\nFigures 10c and 10d. The first point to note is that in the\ninterior ocean, east of about 50\u0002W, the sea level variations\nassociated with transport fluctuations are almost entirely due\nto changes in the density of the water column. The cooling of\nthe water on the western slope results in a drop in steric height\nhere, with a maximum drop of 12 cm near 45\u0002N; the point of\nmaximum penetration of the density signal. The reduction in\nthe magnitude of the positive density anomaly, coupled with\nthe fact that in the interior the increased meridional transport\nis associated with warming of the upper waters between 35\u2013\n20\u0002W, results in a steady increase in sea level, reaching a\npeak of 9 cm at 29\u0002W. Continuing eastward, the first and\nsecond drops in sea level clearly correspond to positive den-\nsity anomalies.\nFigure 6. Composites of anomalous bottom pressure (red), sea level (green), and steric height (blue).\n(a) High composites over thewestern boundary. (b) High composites over the eastern boundary. (c and d) As\nfor Figures 6a and 6b but for the low composites. Composites (see text for method) are based on the index\nTU defined in the text with a threshold value of 1 Sv.\nC12029 BINGHAM AND HUGHES: GEOSTROPHIC MOC DYNAMICS\n8 of 17\nC12029\n[31] In addition to the steric component of sea level, there\nis also a small barotropic component, which appears at the\nbottom as a pressure anomaly (Figures 10c and 10d, red). As\nwas found at 42\u0002N [Bingham andHughes, 2008], it is only on\nthe western side of the basin, in this case west of 45\u0002W,where\nthe bottom pressure is significantly different from zero. Over\nthe narrow interval on the western boundary, where bottom\npressure determines the meridional transport, we see that the\nbottom pressure represents a small modification to the steric\ndominated sea level signal. Initially increasing in magnitude\nabove the upper part of the slope, bottom pressure then falls\nas depth increases, crossing zero near the 1300 m isobath. On\nthe shelf, the steric height is negligible, and the 3 cm sea level\nanomaly associated with a positive meridional transport\nanomaly is almost entirely barotropic.\n[32] Clearly, on average, an increase in the meridional\ntransport at 50\u0002N is associated with a strong density signal\nalong the western boundary at 50\u0002N. To see how this density\nFigure 7.

Note that no filtering has been\napplied to this time series. As Figures 11b and 11c make\napparent, the dominance of the low-frequency mode of\nmeridional transport variability at 50\u0002N results from the\nlow-frequency nature of the density signal below the first\nfew hundred meters of the water column and the pressure\nsignal that is associated with it. Associated with the increas-\ning density of the water column, seasonal activity near the\nsurface becomes increasingly vigorous and there is a deep-\nening of the mixed layer.\n6. Underlying Dynamics\n[33] How do the density changes on the western boundary\nlead to the observed transport variability? Or, more directly,\nhow do the density changes lead to the observed changes\nin bottom pressure? From Figure 10b we see that, to a first\napproximation, the (anomalous) density is horizontally uni-\nform across the slope. A high-low composite of the density\nprofile at 50\u0002N, 48\u0002Wis shown in Figure 12a. As a change in\ndensity cannot, in itself, produce a change in bottom pres-\nsure, we know that, in the absence of other processes, the\npressure anomaly at the ocean floor is zero. The pressure\nprofile (expressed as equivalent cm of water thickness) is\nthen given by\np z\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc \u0002r\u000210\nZ z\n\u0002H\nrdz0: \u00f09\u00de\nThe pressure profile obtained from the density profile in\nFigure 12a is shown in Figure 12b. We see that the increased\ndensity of the water column leads to a decrease in pressure at\neach depth in the water column. The anomalous pressure\ndecreases in magnitude from 11.5 cm at the surface to zero\nat the bottom. The anomalous pressure near the surface is, of\ncourse, the change in steric height, seen clearly in Figure 10d,\nresulting from the increased density. Note that the pressure\nprofile is nearly linear. This is because the vertical change in\nFigure 8. (a\u2013c) High (red) and low (blue) composites of\nthe three fields shown in Figure 7.

In other\nwords, the vertical structure of the density anomaly is not\nimportant, and a similar pressure profile could be obtained, to\nfirst order, from a density anomaly constant in depth. We will\nuse this simplification in our calculation below.\n[34] To clarify our thinking regarding the relationship\nbetween bottom pressure and density changes on sloping\ntopography, we start by considering an illustrative, highly\nidealized example. Consider a fluid of uniform density in\na rectangular channel (nonrotating) with a linearly sloping\nbottom, such that it has the cross section shown in Figure 13.\nThe pressure is simply given by p(z) = \u0002grz, and the bottom\npressure is given by pb = grH, where H(x) is the depth. (For\nthis example, pressure and density are absolute, rather than\ndepartures from time-means.) Now consider what happens\nwhen the fluid is uniformly cooled such that its density is\nuniformly increased byDr. We know that the surface height\nwill change by some amount h(x), but the bottom pressure\nwill not change. Hence rH = (r + Dr)(H + h), which gives\nh \u00bc \u0002 Dr\nr\u00feDrH \u0004 \u0002\nDr\nr\nH : \u00f010\u00de\nGiven that the change in height is proportional to the initial\nwater depth, the surface height will fall by more on the right-\nFigure 10.

In\nthe absence of balancing forces, this situation is, of course,\nunstable, and fluid will flow from left to right so that the\nsurface is horizontal and there is a zero horizontal pressure\ngradient (dashed line in Figure 13). While in the cooling\nphase the mass of each water column was unchanged, in the\nsubsequent equalization phase mass is lost from the left half\nof the channel and gained by the right half. Hence, there is\na change in bottom pressure, with the pressure anomaly in-\ncreasing, linearly from some value\u0002Dpb on the LHS toDpb\non the RHS. The bottom pressure change is simply propor-\ntional to the change in surface height during the equalization\nphase\nDpb \u00bc gr0 hA \u0002 hA \u00fe hB\u00f0 \u00de=2\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc gr0 hA \u0002 hB\u00f0 \u00de=2: \u00f011\u00de\nIn reality, of course, the two phases are concurrent and cannot\nbe separated.\n[35] Naively applying the above analysis to the situation at\n50\u0002N represented in Figure 10d, with side A placed at 50\u0002W\nand side B at 48\u0002W, we have, from the steric height compo-\nsite (blue), hA=\u00023 cm and hB =\u000212 cm, which givesDpb =\n4.5 cm (when expressed as a water thickness). Thus, our very\nsimple model predicts that given the observed changes in\nsteric height, the western boundary pressure anomaly should\ngrow linearly from \u00024.5 cm on the shelf edge to 4.5 cm at\n2300 m. Surprisingly, given the simplifications and assump-\ntions made (density uniform in x and z, linear bottom slope,\nartificial eastern boundary, neglecting rotation and other\nphysics) this value is close to the actual value of \u00b13 cm seen\nin Figure 10d (red). There is also some indication of the\nexpected flattening of the sea level, which is even more\napparent in the HadCM3 composites of sea level (see\nFigures 6a and 6c).\n[36] We shall now put the above simplified model on a\nmore secure theoretical foundation.

In other\nwords, to say that the horizontal pressure gradient is not\nbalanced by a corresponding geostrophic flow (either\nbecause the implied transport is unfeasibly large, or because\nwe are considering a nonrotating scenario, as in the simplified\nexample above) is to say that the potential energy gradient\n(scaled by depth) is balanced by the horizontal (and therefore\ndepth) gradient in bottom pressure. A barotropic adjustment\noccurs to limit the barotropic velocity that would otherwise\narise from the anomalous density field.\n[37] For a homogeneous density anomaly, as just assumed,\nit is straightforward to show that the RHS of (17) reduces to\nghx\/f0. So no balancing geostrophic velocity implies a zero\nsurface height gradient, as we have seen occurs for the simple\nnonrotating channel. Even though the simple analysis above\ngave a reasonable answer when applied to the OCCAM com-\nposite fields (indicating a somewhat homogeneous density\nfield over the slope), the density anomaly clearly varies both\nvertically and laterally, and so the surface gradient resulting\nFigure 12.

Also the barotropic velocity may not be exactly zero.\n[38] However, that the bottom pressure is indeed a local\nbarotropic balancing response to the pressure gradients\nimplied by the density field over a sloping topography is\nclearly demonstrated in Figures 10e and 10f. On the western\nslope, the southward barotropic velocity implied by the\ndensity field (red), given by the second term of the RHS of\n(17), is largely balanced by a northward barotropic velocity\n(blue) given by the first term of the RHS of (17). And, as\nexpected, the actual barotropic velocity over the slope (green)\nis close to zero.\n7. Discussion and Conclusions\n[39] The zonally integrated transport at a particular latitude\nand depth is related through geostrophy to the difference in\npressure between the east and west boundaries. In this paper\nwe have sought to understand how these pressure differences\narise. In the first instance, our analysis of HadCM3 confirms\nour earlier result from OCCAM [Bingham and Hughes,\n2008] that the interannual meridional transport variability\nat latitudes north of 40\u0002N is primarily determined by the\nbottom pressure on the western boundary. This suggests that\nthis is a feature of ocean models in general. Statistical\nanalysis links this relationship between bottom pressure\nand meridional transport with changes in density on the\nwestern continental slope. Yet, the mechanism by which\ndensity changes can lead to variations in pressure is not\nimmediately obvious. With the aid of a highly idealized\nconceptual model we have shown how a uniform density\nchange in a body of water in a channel with a sloping bottom\ncan lead to a change in bottom pressure through the restora-\ntion of the equilibrium condition of a zero horizontal pressure\ngradient; The initial pressure gradients arising because of the\nproportional relationship between change in surface height\nand initial water depth. Finally, we showed that for a more\nrealistic situation this simplified model can be theoretically\nencapsulated as a balance between the barotropic meridional\nvelocity, the zonal derivative of the potential energy change\nof the water column (scaled by water depth), and the zonal\nderivative of the bottom pressure. On the western boundary,\nthe strong density anomaly combines with the steep slope to\namplify the potential energy term, which is primarily bal-\nanced by the bottom pressure gradient because the implied\nbarotropic velocity is not possible.\n[40] We have seen that the relationship between density\nand the bottom pressure ensures that the barotropic velocity\nover the slope due to variations in the density field is small (of\ncourse, wind induced barotropic transports are a different\nmatter). One can see that in the midocean a density anomaly\ndoes not result in net transport. It is only where the density\nanomaly meets the topography that a net transport can arise.\nTherefore, the only alternative to a bottom pressure adjust-\nment to ensure mass conservation would be an opposing\ndensity anomaly meeting the eastern boundary. While this is\npossible, there is no underlying dynamical constraint to\nensure it. Therefore, in general, it will not be the case. Thus,\nwe see that the bottom pressure anomaly must arise to ensure\nmass conservation.\n[41] As with all modeling studies, one can question the\nrealism of physical processes hypothesized on their basis.\nThe fact that the same mechanism appears in two indepen-\ndent models suggests that the result is general to ocean\nmodels. However, one may still ask whether transport vari-\nability in models is a realistic representation of what happens\nin the real ocean. Perhaps the transport variability in the\nocean has quite different characteristics and is produced by\nentirely different means. As discussed below, this question\ncan only be definitively settled with observations, although,\nin reality, their sparseness can still leave interpretations open\nto question. That said, sufficient observations exist to exam-\nine the realism of one of the key components of our proposed\nmechanism, namely the density variations on the western\nboundary.\n[42] We have shown that the proximate cause of transport\nvariability in the models is the strong density changes\nthat occur over the western slope. It is appropriate to\nask, therefore, whether such changes are realistic, and also\nwhether the lack of such changes on the eastern boundary is\nrealistic. Dealing first with the latter point, it is not unrea-\nsonable to suppose that, at high latitudes, density variations\nwith significant depth penetration on the eastern boundary\nare small in comparison with those on the western boundary,\nsince this where deep water is either formed or soon trans-\nported to by the deep western boundary current. Compre-\nhensive observations of the hydrographic structure of the\nwestern subpolar North Atlantic have been published by\nYashayaev [2007]. Comparing his Figure 5 with the anom-\nalous density profile from OCCAM (see Figure 11) shows\nthat both the amplitude of the density variation, and the depth\nto which the cold density anomaly penetrates, are not\nunrealistic. Since these factors are critical to the magnitude\nand form of the pressure anomaly that drives the transport\nvariability in our hypothesis, the observations from the\nLabrador Sea lend support to our proposed mechanism for\ntransport variability. It is also worth noting that the temporal\nevolution of the density field in OCCAM, particularly the\nincreasing density anomaly from the early to mid-1990s,\nfollows quite closely that of the observations. Given that\nYashayaev [2007] and others have linked this to the NAO, the\nsimilarity indicates that OCCAMgoes someway to a realistic\nrepresentation of subpolar ocean\u2019s response to the prevailing\natmospheric conditions.\n[43] A critical factor in our proposed mechanism is the\ninteraction of the density field with the sloping topography.\nPerhaps the limited resolution of the models used influences\nour results. One possibility is that the modeled anomalous\ndensity field is more homogeneous than is the case in reality.\nHowever, it is probably reasonable to assume that variations\nin the density field, particularly at interannual time scales, are\nlarge relative to the width of the continental slope. This is\nparticularly true if, as appears to be the case from both tide\ngauges and altimetry, the slope acts to suppress eddy vari-\nability [Unal and Ghil, 1995; Bingham and Hughes, 2009].\n[44] Although our hypothesised mechanism for transport\nvariability depends on the interaction of density with topog-\nraphy, it should not be confused with JEBAR (Joint effect\nof baroclinicity and topography) introduced by Sarkisyan\nand Invanov [1971]. While this may play some role in the\ndynamics of this region, it does not impact on our consider-\nations, since, by definition, the transport is purely along geo-\nstrophic contours.\nC12029 BINGHAM AND HUGHES: GEOSTROPHIC MOC DYNAMICS\n14 of 17\nC12029\n[45] The focus of this study has been on an understanding\nof the geostrophic dynamics of transport variability. Yet, it\nclearly has implications for how we should monitor the\nMOC. First, our results indicate that subpolar latitudes are\nless affected by localized, higher-frequency variability that\npotentially afflicts lower latitudes. Therefore, compared with\nthe transport variability observed at subtropical latitudes\n[e.g., Cunningham et al., 2007], the transport variability at\nsubpolar latitudes may give a clearer picture of any low-\nfrequency, meridionally coherent variability, which is per-\nhaps nearer to what is intended by the phrase \u2018\u2018MOC\nvariability\u2019\u2019. Second, in confirmation of our earlier results\n[Bingham and Hughes, 2008], we have shown that at\nsubpolar latitudes transport variability can largely be deter-\nmined from observations from the western boundary. Finally,\nour results suggest that the transport variability can be\nrecovered from observations of the density field alone.\nBottom pressure is not required. This is potentially of great\nbenefit because the tendency of bottom pressure recorders to\ndrift limits their usefulness for long-term monitoring.\n[46] In apparent contradiction to our earlier work with\nOCCAM [Bingham and Hughes, 2009], in HadCM3 we\ndo not find a strong relationship between coastal sea level\nand the strength of the meridional transport. In OCCAM, the\nsteric component of sea level goes to zero at the coast\nand so the sea level and bottom pressure become identical\n(Figure 10d) leading to a close relationship between the\nmeridional transport variability and coastal sea level.\nFigure 10a shows that this is because the density anomaly\nassociated with the transport changes does not penetrate\nentirely onto the shelf. In contrast, as Figure 7 makes clear,\ncoastal sea level in HadCM3 reflects mainly the steric vari-\nability of the interior. This seems to be an issue of resolution.\nHadCM3 does not adequately resolve the shelf, its width, and\nperhaps some physical processes such as a shelf currents that\nact as a barrier to the interior steric signal.\n[47] In conclusion, we have described how interannual\nvariations of the zonally integrated transport at 50\u0002N in the\nNorth Atlantic can arise primarily from deeply penetrating\ndensity anomalies over the western continental slope. Criti-\ncally, the slope acts to amplify the zonal gradient of potential\nenergy, which is then balanced by an across slope bottom\npressure gradient and accompanying changes to the meridi-\nonal transport, ensuring mass conservation across the basin.\nWhile bearing in mind that results from models are never\nconclusive, our analysis sheds new light on the nature of me-\nridional transport variability in the subpolar North Atlantic,\nand suggests possible strategies for detecting changes in the\nmeridional overturning circulation.\nAppendix A: Sea Level in HadCM3\n[48] For a free surface model, sea level h is a prognostic\nvariable, and a readily available model field. However,\nHadCM3 is a rigid lid model. This complicates matters\nbecause h, or rather the pressure exerted by lid ps = gr0h,\nmust be diagnosed after the fact from other model output. It\ncan be shown that the surface pressure satisfies the following\nPoisson equation:\nr2ps \u00bc r0 r \u0005 Z \u0002 k \u0006ryt\u00f0 \u00de=H\u00f0 \u00de; \u00f0A1\u00de\nwhere Z is the depth-mean baroclinic acceleration (defined\nshortly), yt is the time derivative of the barotropic stream\nfunction (stream function tendency), and H is the water\ncolumn height [see Gregory, 1993]. For HadCM3, equa-\ntion (A1) is usually solved iteratively using successive over\nrelaxation (SOR). However, we have now established that the\nsolution obtained by this method is inaccurate. While the\nerror is small relative to the range of the variations in sea\nlevel, it becomes apparent when we difference the computed\nsea level from the steric height (computed directly from the\ndensity field) to obtain bottom pressure. Because bottom\npressure represents a small deviation from the steric domi-\nnated sea level variations, particularly over the open ocean\nand for interannual time scales, its calculation is sensitive to\nsmall relative errors in the sea level solutions. In turn, errors\nin pressure will propagate into the geostrophic calculation\nof meridional transport. (This is how we found the SOR-\ncalculated rigid lid pressure to be inaccurate.) Fortunately,\nit is possible to determine the zonal variations in the surface\npressure at any particular latitude more directly. And, since\nwe do not require absolute sea level for the geostrophic me-\nridional transport calculation, zonal variations are sufficient.\n[49] To derive the required sea level differences, we start\nby using the hydrostatic balance to substitute for p in the\nzonal component of the momentum equation (on the beta\nplane). This allows us to write\nut \u00bc u0t \u0002 psx=r0; \u00f0A2\u00de\nwhere the x subscript denotes zonal differentiation (similarly,\nbelow, the y subscript denotes meridional differentiation). In\nthis expression ut\n0 refers to the baroclinic component of the\nacceleration and is given by\nu0t \u00bc \u0002u \u0005 ru\u00fe fv\u0002\ng\nr0\nZ 0\nz\nrdz0 \u00fe Fu; \u00f0A3\u00de\nwhere v is the meridional component of the velocity u, f is the\nCoriolis parameter and Fu is the zonal component of friction.\nThe acceleration can be written as u = u^ + u where u is the\ndepth average velocity defined by\nu \u00bc 1\nH\nZ 0\n\u0002H\nudz: \u00f0A4\u00de\nIf follows that px\ns \/r0 = ut\n0 \u0002 ut = ut0 \u0002 ut \u0002 u^t. However, u^t =\nut\n0 \u0002 ut0 since ps = ps. Hence\npsx=r0 \u00bc u0t \u0002 ut : \u00f0A5\u00de\nSince, under the rigid lid approximation, the depth integrated\nflow is nondivergent we have\nHu\u00f0 \u00dex\u00fe Hu\u00f0 \u00dey\u00bc 0: \u00f0A6\u00de\nSo we can define a stream function such that Hu = \u0002yy.\nFinally, therefore, we can write\npsx=r0 \u00bc u0t \u0002\n1\nH\nyy\n\u0004 \u0005\nt\n: \u00f0A7\u00de\nC12029 BINGHAM AND HUGHES: GEOSTROPHIC MOC DYNAMICS\n15 of 17\nC12029\nFrom here, the Poisson equation can be derived by combin-\ning the equation with a similar equation for the v compo-\nnent of the momentum equation cross differentiation [e.g.,\nBryan, 1997]. However equation (A7) is sufficient for our\nneeds.\n[50] Assuming that on the eastern boundary where x = xE\nwe have ps = pE\ns = r0hE. Integrating equation (A7) west from\nthe eastern boundary, and using ps = gr0h, then yields an\nequation for sea level relative to the value on the eastern\nboundary\nh x\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc \u0002 1\ng\nZ x\nxE\nu0t \u0002\n1\nH\nyy\n\u0004 \u0005\nt\n\b \t\ndx0 \u00fe hE: \u00f0A8\u00de\nOf course, the value on the eastern boundary hE remains\nundetermined. However, since equation (8) involves only\nrelative values of he and hw, it is clear that this is not a problem\nfor the determination of the depth-dependent components of\nthe transport, or, importantly in the context of our analysis,\nfor separating the eastern and western boundary components\nof the meridional transport.\n[51] Acknowledgments.
