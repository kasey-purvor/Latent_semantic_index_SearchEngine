In both countries, investment shifted from infrastructure to social services and \nhuman capital formation. Resources were rebalanced in favour of poorer districts. In Bolivia, \ndecentralisation made government more responsive by re-directing public investment to areas \nof greatest need. In Colombia, municipalities increased investment significantly while \nrunning costs fell. Six important lessons emerge from the comparison. For decentralisation to \nwork well, (i) local democracy must be transparent, fair and competitive; (ii) local \ngovernments must face hard budget constraints; (iii) central government must be scaled back; \n(iv) significant tax-raising powers must be devolved; and (v) decentralization is composed of \ndistinct, separable components, the sequencing of which is important.  Lastly, (vi) what \ndecentralisation achieves, and whether it is advisable, hinge on how central government \nbehaved pre-reform. \n \nKey words: decentralisation, public investment, Latin America, Bolivia, Colombia, local \ngovernment \n1. Introduction \n All over the world, developing countries are decentralizing their public \nadministrations in an attempt to make them more efficient, flexible and responsive. \nDecentralisation is central to the policy agendas of countries as disparate as Mexico, \nEgypt, Ghana and India. And under the guises of subsidiarity, devolution and federalism, \nreform is firmly in the foreground of policy discourse in rich countries too. But \nsurprisingly, the empirical literature is unable to agree on what decentralisation\u2019s effects \non public administration and public finances have been in practice (Kim et al. 2005). \nAdvocates (for example Olowu and Wunsch 1990; Putnam 1993; World Bank 1994; \nUNDP 1993) argue that decentralisation can make government more responsive to the \ngoverned by \u2018tailoring levels of consumption to the preferences of smaller, more \nhomogeneous groups\u2019 (Wallis and Oates 1988, 5). Opponents (for example Crook and \nSverrisson 1999; Prud\u2019homme 1995; Samoff 1990; Smith 1985; Tanzi 1995) dispute this, \narguing that local governments are too susceptible to elite capture, and too lacking in \ntechnical, human and financial resources, to produce a range of public services that are \nvaried, efficient and responsive to local demand. But neither side is able to substantiate \nits arguments convincingly with empirical evidence. \n Recent studies in the Journal of Development Studies have on balance tended \ntoward the negative camp. In a study of rural water supply in central India, Asthana \n(2003) finds that decentralisation of water provision decreased efficiency. Operating \ncosts per unit of output were higher in decentralised utilities, and asset utilization was \nlower. Both differences are statistically significant. Along similar lines, Akin, Hutchinson \nand Strumpf (2005) analyse a detailed database of Ugandan local government health \nbudgets. Using subjective characterisations of the degree of \u2018publicness\u2019 of different \n 1\nhealth activities, they find evidence that local governments are allocating declining \nproportions of their budgets to public goods, and increasing shares to publicly financed \nprivate goods. They attribute this behaviour to free riding by local officials on the health \nexpenditures of their neighbours. Woller and Phillips (1998) test the much broader claim \nthat decentralisation will increase the long-term growth rate by making the public sector \nmore responsive and efficient. Using panel data on 23 developing countries between \n1974-1991, they find no strong evidence of any systematic effect of decentralisation on \neconomic growth. Johnson, Deshingkar and Start (2005) buck this negative trend by \nfinding that India\u2019s recent decentralisation was associated with positive outcomes for the \nrural poor in Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. But their enthusiasm for \ndecentralisation is nonetheless limited. The pro-poor outcomes achieved, they argue, \nwere due to central and state governments\u2019 ability to counterbalance the elite capture that \ndecentralisation tends to spawn, which naturally favours the rich. \n The broader literature takes a more positive view of decentralisation, but is \nultimately inconclusive. Consider the broadest surveys: Rondinelli, Cheema and Nellis \n(1983) note that decentralisation has usually disappointed its partisans. Most developing \ncountries implementing decentralisation experienced serious administrative problems. \nAlthough few comprehensive evaluations of the benefits and costs of decentralisation \nefforts have been conducted, those that were attempted indicate limited success in some \ncountries but not others. A decade and a half later, surveys by Piriou-Sall (1998), Manor \n(1999) and Smoke (2001) are slightly more positive, but with caveats about the strength \nof the evidence in decentralisation\u2019s favour. Manor notes that the evidence, though \nextensive, is still incomplete, but ends his study with the opinion that \u2018while \n 2\ndecentralisation \u2026is no panacea, it has many virtues and is worth pursuing\u2019. Smoke, by \ncontrast, finds the evidence mixed and anecdotal, and asks whether there is empirical \njustification for pursuing decentralisation at all. Given the sheer size of the literature, the \nlack of progress is surprising. \nThis paper examines the effects of decentralisation on: (i) the uses of public \nresources, (ii) their distribution across space, and (iii) government responsiveness and \npoverty-orientation, by comparing two recent cases of extensive reform: Bolivia and \nColombia. Although these issues are just two of the many dealt with above, they are \namongst the most important, and form the core of the theoretical case in favour of \ndecentralisation (Blair 2000; Dillinger 1994; Musgrave 1959; Oates 1972). \nFocusing on a pair of broadly similar countries in the same region limits problems \nof data comparability, and geographic, cultural and historical context. But it is the \ndecentralisation-specific similarities that are most striking, and that make this comparison \nparticularly good. Until reforms began, Bolivia had few elected mayors and Colombia \nhad none. Municipal administrations in both countries had little power and few resources. \nBoth countries were characterised by highly vertical administrations in which authority \ncascaded down from the President, through ministries and state governments, to local \nofficials in the farthest towns and villages. In such a system, accountability was upwards \nand not downwards. \nBoth countries turned to decentralisation in the early 1990s (although Colombia \ntook a few, cautious steps somewhat earlier). In both countries \u2013 as we discuss below \u2013 \nreforms were far-reaching. Significantly, both decentralizations gave a prominent role to \nmunicipalities, which in both countries are mostly small and rural. Average municipal \n 3\npopulation in Bolivia is 20,847, and 36,099 in Colombia, although both figures are biased \nupwards by the presence of a few very large cities. Fully 82 per cent of municipalities \nhave populations below the average in Bolivia, and 86 per cent in Colombia. The \nproportion of municipalities with fewer than 10,000 inhabitants is 55 per cent in Bolivia \nand 40 per cent in Colombia. \n Decentralisation is henceforth defined as the devolution by central (that is, \nnational) government of specific functions, with all of the administrative, political and \neconomic attributes that these entail, to democratic local (that is, municipal) governments \nwhich are independent of the centre within a legally delimited geographic and functional \ndomain. The rest of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 reviews the Bolivian and \nColombian decentralisation programs, focusing on their legal and budgetary aspects. \nSection 3 provides summarised analysis of the economic outcomes of decentralisation in \neach country. Section 4 summarises the effects of reform in Bolivia and Colombia, and \nteases out policy lessons for other countries contemplating reform. \n2. The Bolivian and Colombian Decentralisation Programs \n2.1 Popular Participation in Bolivia \n The Bolivian revolution of 1952-1953 destroyed an autocratic plutocracy that not \nonly oppressed the indigenous majority but \u2013 especially in rural areas \u2013 literally enslaved \nthem (Klein 1993). This was replaced with a nationalist project to recast social relations \nthrough the active intervention of the state in the nation\u2019s social and economic affairs. \nRevolutionary protagonists sought to transform a poor, backward, extremely unequal \ncountry by expropriating the \u2018commanding heights\u2019 of the economy \u2013 land and mines \u2013 \nso smashing the power of an entrenched elite. The new government then embarked upon \n 4\na state-led modernization strategy in which public corporations and regional governments \ninitiated a concerted drive to break down provincial fiefdoms, transform existing social \nrelations, and create a modern, industrial, egalitarian society (Dunkerley 1984). \nRevolutionaries deemed direct political control necessary, and so the country quickly \nacquired one of the most centralised state structures in the region. \n Intellectual trends of the subsequent four decades \u2013 Dependencia theory, \nDevelopmentalism, and Import Substitution Industrialization \u2013 all contributed to the \ncentralizing tendency, as did the military governments which overthrew elected \nadministrations with increasing frequency from the 1960s onwards (Klein 1993). With \npolitical power so little dispersed, there was little point in establishing the legal and \npolitical instruments of local governance. As a result, local government existed in Bolivia \nonly in the 30-40 largest and most important cities. Beyond these, municipalities existed \nat most in name, as a ceremonial institution devoid of both administrative capability and \nresources. And in most of the country they did not exist at all. \n Although the 1994 reform was sprung on an unsuspecting nation, the concept of \ndecentralisation was by no means new. For more than 30 years a decentralisation debate \nfocused on Bolivia\u2019s nine departments ebbed and flowed politically \u2013 at times taking on \nburning importance, other times all but forgotten. The issue became caught up in the \ncountry\u2019s centrifugal tensions, as regional elites in Santa Cruz and Tarija consciously \nmanipulated the threat of secession to Brazil and Argentina respectively \u2013 with which \neach is economically more integrated than La Paz \u2013 to extract resources from the centre. \nThe Bolivian paradox of a highly centralised but weak state, and a socially diverse \npopulation with weak national identity, meant that such threats were taken seriously by \n 5\nthe political class, which blocked all moves to devolve more power and authority to \nBolivia\u2019s regions. \nWhat spurred the change of tack?  Why then?  Two factors stand out. The less \nimportant one arises from Bolivia\u2019s failure to achieve sustained, healthy growth despite \nwrenching economic reform overseen by the IMF and World Bank. Fifteen years of near-\nzero per capita economic growth sapped the credibility of the state and fomented social \nunrest. The new Movimiento Nacionalista Revolucionario (MNR) administration of Pres. \nGonzalo S\u00e1nchez de Lozada (1993-1997) saw the structure of government itself as an \nimpediment to growth. Decentralisation was an attempt to deepen structural reform in \norder to make the state more efficient and responsive to the population, and so regain its \nlegitimacy in the voters\u2019 eyes. \nThe more important factor arises from the rise of ethnically-based, populist \npolitics in the 1980s, which undercut the MNR\u2019s traditional dominance of the rural vote, \nand posed a serious challenge to its (self-declared) role as the \u2018natural party of \ngovernment\u2019. This rural dominance was itself born out of the MNR\u2019s agrarian reforms of \nthe revolution. Hence a party with a tradition of radical reform, which found itself in \nsecular decline, sought a second, re-defining moment. In a typically bold move, it sought \nto reorganise government, re-cast the relationship between citizens and the state, and so \nwin back the loyalty of Bolivians living outside major cities. To a very important extent, \ndecentralisation was a gambit to capture rural voters for at least another generation.3\n Against this background, the Bolivian decentralisation reform was announced in \n1994. The Law of Popular Participation, developed almost in secret by a small number of \ntechnocrats (Tuchschneider 1997), was announced to the nation to general surprise, \n 6\nfollowed by ridicule, followed by determined opposition of large parts of society.4  It is \nnotable that opposition to the law, which was fierce for a few months, came principally \nfrom the teachers\u2019 union, NGOs and other social actors, and not from political parties. \nJudged by their public declarations, this opposition was an incoherent mix of accusations \nand fears that denoted a deep suspicion of the government\u2019s motives, and not a careful \nreading of the law. The lack of opposition from parties can largely be attributed to the \nsweeping reforms that were being enacted by the MNR government at the same time as \ndecentralisation. With privatization of the main state enterprises, education reform, and a \ncomprehensive restructuring of the executive branch all being pushed at once, \ndecentralisation was relegated to the second tier of political parties\u2019 concerns. The \nopposition focused its attention elsewhere, and it never became a fighting point. \nFirst made public in January of that year, the law was promulgated by Congress in \nApril and implemented from July. The scale of the change in resource flows and political \npower that it brought about were enormous. The core of the law consists of four points \n(Secretar\u00eda Nacional de Participaci\u00f3n Popular, 1994): \n1. Resource Allocation. Funds devolved to municipalities doubled to 20 per cent of all \nnational tax revenue. More importantly, allocation amongst municipalities switched \nfrom unsystematic, highly political criteria to a strict per capita basis. \n2. Responsibility for Public Services. Ownership of local infrastructure in education, \nhealth, water & sanitation, irrigation, roads, sports and culture was given to \nmunicipalities, with the concomitant responsibility to maintain, equip and administer \nthese facilities, and invest in new ones. But the staffing of this infrastructure, \nincluding responsibility for salaries, remained central attributes. \n 7\n3. Oversight Committees (Comit\u00e9s de Vigilancia) were established to provide an \nalternative channel for representing popular demand in the policy-making process. \nComposed of representatives from local, grass-roots groups, these bodies propose \nprojects and oversee municipal expenditure. Their ability to have disbursements of \nPopular Participation funds suspended if they find funds are being misused or stolen \ncan paralyze local government, and gives them real power. \n4. Municipalisation. Existing municipalities were expanded to include suburbs and \nsurrounding rural areas, and 198 new municipalities (out of some 315 in all) were \ncreated. \nThe central agencies previously charged with regional and local investment projects \u2013 the \nregional development corporations \u2013 were scaled back as a result. There were relatively \nfew direct transfers of staff to municipalities, although many \u2018quasi-transfers\u2019 appear to \nhave operated informally, through the labour market. And a small, complementary \nprogram of municipal training and capacity building was established with support from \ninternational donors. The Laws of Decentralised Administration (1995), and of \nMunicipalities (1999), followed subsequently, further defining the municipal mandate \nand locating it in a broader governmental architecture. \n The change in local affairs that these measures catalyzed is immense. Before \nreform local government was absent throughout the vast majority of Bolivian territory, \nand the broader state present at most in the form of a military garrison, schoolhouse or \nhealth post, each reporting to its respective ministry. After reform, elected local \ngovernments sprouted throughout the land. \n 8\n The role of oversight committees (OCs) is worth underlining. These are, in effect, \na non-electoral form of representation that operate in parallel to Bolivia\u2019s municipal \ncouncils and mayors. They are composed of the representatives of grass-root \norganizations within each municipality. A municipality will typically be divided into four \nor more regions, each of which nominates one member to the OC from amongst its local \ngrass-roots leaders. OC members elect from amongst themselves a president, whose legal \nstatus is comparable to the mayor\u2019s. The OC\u2019s power lies in its natural moral authority, as \nwell as the ability to suspend disbursements from central to local government if it judges \nthat funds are being misused. Oversight committees thus comprise an additional layer of \nsocial representation similar to an upper house of parliament, enforcing accountability on \nthe mayor and municipal council.5\n2.2 The Decentralisation Process in Colombia \nLike Bolivia, Colombia was traditionally a highly centralised country, with \nmayors and governors directly named by central government. Governors, in particular, \nwere the President\u2019s hombres de confianza, and carried out his will in the regions. Like \nBolivia, a deep and extensive decentralisation program crystallised around the \nconstitutional and legal reforms of 1991-1993. The earlier introduction of a number of \npiecemeal fiscal and political reforms mean that Colombia\u2019s process was not a Bolivian-\nstyle \u2018big bang\u2019 reform. But when placed in the international context, the coherent and \nextensive package of measures that jelled in 1991-1993 should be regarded as a \u2018fast-\ntrack\u2019 program.6  Taking the long view, Ceballos and Hoyos (2004) identify three broad \nphases of reform in Colombia: \n 9\nPhase 1 began in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and included a number of \nspecific fiscal measures aimed at strengthening municipal finances. Most important of \nthese were Law 14 of 1983 and Law 12 of 1986, which assigned to municipalities \nincreased powers of tax collection, including especially sales tax, and established \nparameters for the investment of these funds. \nPhase 2, which began in the mid-1980s, was more concerned with political and \nadministrative matters. Amongst the most important of these measures was Law 11 of \n1986, which established the popular election of mayors, and sought to promote popular \nparticipation in local public decision-making through Juntas Administradoras Locales, \namongst others. Reforms enshrined in the 1991 constitution, such as citizens\u2019 initiatives, \nmunicipal planning councils, open cabildos, the ability to revoke mayoral mandates, \nreferenda, and popular consultations, further deepened political decentralisation. The \n1991 constitution also established the popular election of governors. \nBeginning in 1991, and continuing for most of the decade, Phase 3 consisted of a \nnumber of laws that regulated the new constitution, and other fiscal and administrative \nreforms of the period. These laws assigned increasing responsibility to municipalities for \nthe planning, financing and provision of public services and social investment, and \nprovided additional resources for the same by increasing central government transfers to \nlocal governments gradually but significantly. Over time, municipalities \u2018certified\u2019 as \nhaving high administrative capacity were granted greater political autonomy and greater \ndiscretion over devolved funds. Automatic transfers to regional governments rose from \nabout 20 per cent to over 40 per cent of total government spending, placing Colombia \n 10\nfirst in the region amongst unitary countries, and third overall after the two big federal \ncountries, Brazil and Argentina.7\nAs for Bolivia, the aggregate effect of these reforms was a large increase in the \nauthority and operational independence of Colombia\u2019s municipal governments, \naccompanied by a huge rise in the resources they controlled. Municipalities were allowed \nto raise and spend significant sums of taxes, central-to-local government transfers \nincrease more than three-fold,8 and municipal governments were permitted to issue \npublic debt. Overall municipal expenditures and investments rose five-fold, while \nrunning costs remained stable over the period (see figure 7 below). An important \ndifference with Bolivia is that whereas Bolivia implemented fiscal (taxation and \nexpenditure) and political (elections, popular consultations) decentralisation measures at \nonce, Colombia sequenced its reforms, moving forward first with measures to bolster \nlocal revenues, and only then turning to local politics. This is an important difference, \nwhich we return to below. \nWhat drove decentralisation in Colombia?  Ceballos and Hoyos group the \nmotivations into two categories. The first of these is the challenge of political instability. \nColombia is a violent country, with a long history of civil conflict, armed rebellion, \npersistently high levels of \u2018common\u2019 crime, and the use of violence as an explicit tool of \npolitical mobilization. The late 1970s saw levels of violence rise again as the internal \nconflict intensified. At the same time, social protests and pressures from regional groups \nmultiplied, linked to the central state\u2019s inability to meet demands for social services and \npublic investment. Secondly, the political hegemony over the instruments of the state of \nthe traditional Liberal and Conservative parties began to be seen more and more as a \n 11\nliability \u2013 less the solution to a previous round of civil violence (La Violencia) and more \na cause of the next one. Colombians from across the political spectrum became convinced \nthat the inability of the state to respond to society\u2019s demands \u2013 and its outright absence in \nmany areas (the \u2018internal frontier\u2019), combined with the waning legitimacy of an \narbitrarily restricted democracy,9 were leading to public sector inefficiencies, civic \ndiscontent, and ultimately armed violence. \n Thus from the start decentralisation in Colombia was a multi-faceted tool \ndesigned to serve a combination of purposes particular to Colombia\u2019s troubled \ndemocracy. Through it, policy elites sought to increase the levels of electoral and citizen \nparticipation within the existing institutional framework. They sought to open the \npolitical system through popular elections at the regional and local levels, where they \nhoped new political movements would emerge and eventually assume power, so breaking \nthe liberal-conservative hegemony over the resources of the state. \n3. The Impacts of Decentralisation \nThis section compares the allocation of resources across different uses, and across \nspace, by central vs. local government in the two countries. In accordance with the \u2018big \nbang\u2019 nature of its reform, evidence for Bolivia is presented in stark before-vs.-after \nterms. By contrast, Colombia\u2019s more gradual reform is better suited to a time series \napproach, and hence that evidence covers the entire period 1993-2002. Ideally this paper \nwould present the same graphs and tables for both countries. Unfortunately, different \ncountries collect data in different ways, and current data availability for Colombia and \nBolivia oblige us to present evidence that is similar, but not identical. \n 12\n3.1 The Impact of Decentralisation in Bolivia \n Measuring the effects of decentralisation in a country where 2\/3 of municipalities \ndid not exist before reform presents special methodological problems. The vast majority \nof public investment in villages and towns before 1994 was undertaken by central \ngovernment. But financial records of these projects do not include information on which \nmunicipality they would eventually belong to. Hence it became necessary to work with \nlocal experts in geographic information systems to allocate the thousands of public \ninvestment projects in the 1987-1993 Public Sector Investment Budget10 to Bolivia\u2019s \nmunicipalities as created or expanded in the 1994 reform. This was carried out under the \nauspices of a World Bank-funded research project, \u2018Decentralization and Participatory \nPlanning in Bolivia\u2019, which analyzed the effects of the 1994 reform on government \nresponsiveness to objective and subjectively expressed local needs, through a blend of \nqualitative and quantitative methods. By comparing detailed financial reports from pre-\nreform investment projects with high-resolution maps of Bolivian towns, villages and \ngeographic features, a small team of Bolivian geographers was able to identify the \nphysical location of the majority of central government investments, and then allocate \nthem to the municipalities defined by the decentralization reform. In this way, we were \nable to re-construct municipal investment data for a period in which most municipalities \ndid not exist. \n The extent of the change is perhaps best appreciated by examining the changes in \nresource flows decentralisation catalyzed. Before decentralisation, 308 Bolivian \nmunicipalities divided amongst them a mere 14 per cent of all centrally devolved funds, \nwhile the three main cities took 86 per cent. After decentralisation the shares reversed to \n 13\n73 per cent and 27 per cent respectively. The per capita criterion resulted in a massive \nshift of resources away from the richest, most developed urban centres. Amongst smaller, \npoorer rural districts, resource increases of 50,000 \u2013 100,000 per cent were quite \ncommon. \n A more important change was to the composition of investment. Figure 1 shows \naggregate central government investment during the last three years before \ndecentralisation (1991-1993), divided by sector, compared to aggregate local government \ninvestment during the first three years after decentralisation (1994-1996), divided by \nsector.11  For the sake of a clean comparison, central investment (dark bars) includes only \nresources controlled by central government agencies, while local investment (pale bars) \nincludes only resources controlled by local governments (that is, municipalities). The \ndifferences are large. In the years leading up to reform, central government invested most \nin transport, hydrocarbons, multisectoral12 and energy, which together accounted for 73 \nper cent of public investment during 1991-1993. After decentralisation local governments \ninvest most heavily in education, urban development, and water & sanitation, together \naccounting for 79 per cent of municipal investment. Of the sectors accounting for roughly \n\u00be of total investment in both cases, central and local government have not even one in \ncommon. The evidence implies that local and central government have very different \ninvestment priorities. This trend is even stronger when we disaggregate the figures. It is \nnotable that in many municipalities local tax revenues began to rise sharply after 1994, \nalbeit from a very low base. In those districts where local revenues formed a larger share \nof total investment, the shift to social investment was even stronger. \n 14\nFigure 1 \nLocal v.

Figure 2 shows how total investment \nchanged between the same two periods, 1991-1993 and 1994-1996, by sector. We see \nthat decentralisation increased total (central + national) investment in education more \nthan five-fold, more than doubled water and sanitation investment, and led to large \nincreases for water management, transport and health. By contrast, total investment fell \nmost strongly in economic production and infrastructure. \n 15\nFigure 2 \nSector Change (%)\nEducation 547%\nWater & Sanitation 133%\nWater Management 77%\nTransport 44%\nHealth 43%\nMining & Metallurgy 34%\nMultisectoral 11%\nHydrocarbons -18%\nEnergy -23%\nUrban Development -27%\nAgriculture -34%\nIndustry & Tourism -57%\nCommunication -59%\nTOTAL 16%\nNet Change in National (Central + Local) \nPublic Investment, 1991-93 vs. 1994-96\n \nSource: National Secretariat of Public Investment and External Finance; original calculations. \n \n It is also instructive to examine how investment was distributed \ngeographically among Bolivia\u2019s municipalities before and after decentralisation. Again, \nwe compare central(-only) investment in 1991-1993 with local(-only) investment in \n1994-1996. Figures 3-5 show total investment per capita in all Bolivia\u2019s municipalities, \nwhere each municipality is a dot. An equitable distribution of investment would appear as \na narrow band of points. What do the data show?  Figure 3 shows that per capita \ninvestment before decentralisation was indeed highly unequal, with large investments in \nthree districts and the vast majority at or near zero. Figure 4 corrects for the skewing \neffect of the highest observations by excluding the upper 12, allowing us to expand the \nvertical axis and see more detail. Though the distribution now appears less unequal, the \ndensity of dots increases steadily as we move downwards. Fully one-half of all \nobservations lie on the horizontal axis. These municipalities received nothing. Closer \nexamination reveals that these are disproportionately Bolivia\u2019s small, poor, rural districts. \n 16\nFigure 3 \nPre-Decentralization Investment per capita\n0\n10,000\n20,000\n30,000\n40,000\n50,000\n60,000\n0 100 200 300\nMunicipality ID No.\nB\ns \npe\nr c\nap\nita\n \nFigure 4 \nPre-Decentralization Investment per capita\n(highest 12 observations dropped)\n0\n500\n1,000\n1,500\n2,000\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300\nMunicipality Identity No.\nB\ns \npe\nr c\nap\nita\n \nInvestment under centralised government was thus hugely skewed in favour of a \nfew municipalities that received enormous sums, a second group where investment was \nsignificant, and the unfortunate half of districts which received nothing. Compare this to \nfigure 5, which shows municipal investment after decentralisation. This chart shows no \ndistrict over Bs.700\/capita, a broad band with greatest density between Bs.100-\n200\/capita, and only a few points touching the axis. Average municipal investment for \nthis period is Bs.208\/capita, and thus the band contains the mean.13  These crude \nindicators imply that decentralised government distributed public investment much more \nevenly than centralised government. Equality in per-capita terms is, of course, largely a \n 17\nresult of the design of the reform, as noted in section 2.1, point 1. The ex-post result is \nthus not as surprising as the ex-ante one: central government, with a much larger budget \nand free rein over all of Bolivia\u2019s municipalities, consistently chose a highly unequal \ndistribution of investment across space. We return to this point in lesson six below. \nFigure 5 \nPost-Decentralization Investment per capita\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\n700\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300\nMunicipal Identity No.\nB\ns \npe\nr c\nap\nita\n \nSource: National Secretariat of Public Investment and External Finance; original calculations. \n \n Did these changes of allocation across sectors and space lead to any deeper \nchanges in the quality of public investment?  Ideally we would investigate such a \nquestion by comparing quality-adjusted units of public outputs before and after \ndecentralisation. But such information is unfortunately not available for either country \n(nor, indeed, for most countries). But we can investigate a related question, regarding \ndecentralisation\u2019s effects on the responsiveness of public investment to local needs. As \nnoted above, improved responsiveness to local citizens is one of the central \u2013 and most \ndisputed \u2013 arguments in favour of decentralisation, and hence any evidence in this respect \nis of particular interest. \n Figure 6 shows scatter plots of central government investment (left-hand side \ngraphs) vs. local government investment (right-hand side graphs) in education, \nagriculture, water and sanitation, and urban development. The graphs plot central \n 18\ngovernment investment during the last three years before decentralisation vs. local \ngovernment investment during the first three years after decentralisation, against \nobjective indicators of real local need in each municipality. Each graph includes a \nregression line summarizing the overall relationship. \nThe first comparison shows that central education investment fell as the illiteracy \nrate rose, meaning central government chose to concentrate education resources where \nliteracy was higher. This is the opposite of what we would expect if central government \nwere investing in areas of greatest need. After decentralisation, by contrast, local \ngovernments invested progressively more where illiteracy was higher. Both regression \nlines are statistically significant \u2013 at the 5 per cent and 0.1 per cent levels respectively. \nNote how many municipalities received no education investment at all under centralised \nrule. The following two graphs show a similar pattern for agriculture. Central government \ninvested less where malnutrition rates were higher, whereas local governments invested \nmore where malnutrition was higher. Both of these regression lines are significant at the \n5 per cent level. The pattern is similar, though less dramatic, for water and sanitation, and \nurban development. 14  In both sectors, strong tendencies to concentrate investment where \nit was least needed were reversed with decentralisation, although in both cases local \ngovernments\u2019 progressiveness is weak and statistically not significant. But even if we \nassume both decentralised regression lines have a slope of zero, this marks a significant \nchange from central investment that increased where need was lower. \n 19\nFigure 6 \nCentral Gov\u2019t Investment, by Municipality Local Gov\u2019t Investment, by Municipality \nEducation\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70\nIlliteracy Rate  (%)\nTo\nta\nl I\nnv\nes\ntm\nen\nt, \n19\n91\n-9\n3 \n (B\ns\/\nca\np)\nEducation\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\n160\n180\n200\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 7\nIlliteracy Rate (%)\nTo\nta\nl I\nnv\nes\ntm\nen\nt, \n19\n94\n-9\n6 \n(B\ns\/\nca\np)\n0\n \nAgriculture\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60\nMalnutrition Rate (Male)\nTo\nta\nl I\nnv\nes\ntm\nen\nt, \n19\n91\n-9\n3 \n(B\ns\/\nca\np)\nAgriculture\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n0 10 20 30 40 50 6Malnutrition Rate (Male)\nTo\nta\nl I\nnv\nes\ntm\nen\nt, \n19\n94\n-9\n7  \n(B\ns\/\nca\np)\n0\n \nWater and Sanitation\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70\n% of Population Without Sewerage\nTo\nta\nl I\nnv\nes\ntm\nen\nt, \n19\n91\n-9\n3 \n(B\ns\/\nca\np)\nWater and Sanitation\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 7\n% of Population Without Sewerage\nTo\nta\nl I\nnv\nes\ntm\nen\nt, \n19\n94\n-9\n6  \n(B\ns\/\nca\np)\n0\n \n 20\nUrban Development\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\n160\n180\n200\n00.0050.010.0150.020.025\nMarkets per capita (reversed axis)\nTo\nta\nl I\nnv\nes\ntm\nen\nt, \n19\n91\n-9\n3 (B\ns\/\nca\np)\nUrban Development\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\n160\n180\n200\n00.0050.010.0150.020.025\nMarkets per capita (reversed axis)\nTo\nta\nl I\nnv\nes\ntm\nen\nt, \n19\n94\n-9\n7 (B\ns\/\nca\np)\n \nSources: National Institute of Statistics, National Secretariat of Popular Participation, National Secretariat of Public \nInvestment and External Finance; original calculations. \n \n These graphs imply that decentralisation increased government responsiveness to \nreal local needs. After 1994, investment in education, agriculture, and water and \nsanitation was higher where illiteracy rates, malnutrition rates, and sewerage non-\nconnection rates were higher; and urban development investment was higher in places \nwhere public infrastructure such as marketplaces was more scarce. That is to say, \nalthough median investment in these sectors increased throughout Bolivia after \ndecentralisation, the increases were even higher in those districts where the objective \nneed for such services was greatest. These changes were driven by the actions of \nBolivia\u2019s 250 smallest, poorest, mostly rural municipalities investing newly devolved \npublic funds in their highest-priority projects. This evidence supports the findings of \nFaguet (2004), which investigates a similar question. \n3.2 The Impact of Decentralisation in Colombia \n Our Colombia dataset comprises 950 municipalities \u2013 80 per cent of the universe \n\u2013 for the decade 1993-2002. For the purposes of this paper, 1993 is the base year, after \nwhich decentralisation was progressively implemented throughout the country. This view \ntakes account of the piecemeal nature of Colombia\u2019s earliest decentralisation measures in \n 21\nthe 1970s and 1980s, and considers that \u2018real\u2019 decentralisation did not begin until the raft \nof reforms included in the new constitution, plus accompanying regulatory laws (1991-\n1993), were promulgated. We thus consider 1993, the beginning of the full \ndecentralisation process, to be a year with relatively high centralization, and 2002, at the \nother end of a decade of reform, as a year with relatively high decentralisation. Focusing \non the changes that occurred throughout this decade allows us to examine the full \nimplications of these deep reforms as they took hold. \nAs for Bolivia, statistics from Colombia tell an eloquent story. Figure 7 plots \nmunicipal investment and running costs as a percentage of GDP. While invested sums \nrose to some five times their initial values, personnel costs remained essentially constant. \nThis contradicts critics who claim that decentralisation leads to increased bureaucracy at \nthe expense of productive investment. It also contradicts those who say that \ninexperienced or politically captured local governments will go on a hiring spree, so \nwasting scarce resources. The numbers tell the opposite tale \u2013 as decentralisation \nadvanced and reform deepened, municipalities dedicated more and more of their \nresources to public investment, and less and less to operating costs. \nFigure 7 \n0.00%\n1.00%\n2.00%\n3.00%\n4.00%\n5.00%\n6.00%\n7.00%\n1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002\nMunicipal Expenditures & Investment (%GDP)\nInvestment Running Costs\n \nSource: Ministry of Finance, National Planning Department; original calculations. \n \n 22\nHow was this increasing investment budget spent?  Figure 8 shows investment by \nsector in billions of constant 2000 pesos, and allows us to compare social investment \n(that is, human capital formation) with investment in physical infrastructure. We see that \neducation, health and water investment rose between three and seven times in constant \npeso terms, while investment in roads doubled and housing remained broadly stable. \nDecentralisation thus significantly increased investment in social services and human \ncapital formation at the expense of physical infrastructure, again the opposite of what \nmany of decentralisation\u2019s critics contend. As in Bolivia, local tax revenues rose strongly \nwith decentralisation, although from a much higher base, so that local revenues were a \nmuch larger share of total municipal resources in Colombia. And also like Bolivia, the \ntrend towards social and human capital investment was stronger in those municipalities \nwhere local revenues were a larger share of the total. These facts contradict those who \nclaim that local government is too ignorant, corrupt, or inept to invest in basic social \nservices, which should be left instead to a wiser and more technocratic central \ngovernment. Decentralisation coincided with an increase in social investment locally, and \nas decentralisation deepened the trend accelerated. \nFigure 8 \nMunicipal Investment in Constant Terms\n0\n500\n1,000\n1,500\n2,000\n2,500\n3,000\n3,500\n4,000\n1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002\nB\nill\nio\nns\n o\nf 2\n00\n0 \npe\nso\ns\nEducation Health Water Roads Housing\n \nSource: Ministry of Finance, National Planning Department; original calculations. \n 23\nDid decentralisation change the distribution of resources across space?  Figures 9 \nand 10 compare central government investment in 1994 with local government \ninvestment in 2003, measured in constant 2002 pesos\/capita. For the sake of \ncomparability with Bolivia, figure 9 includes only resources controlled by the centre, and \nfigure 10 includes only resources controlled by municipalities. Each dot represents a \nmunicipality. Moving from figure 9 to figure 10, we see that the dots become more \ndispersed after reform. Hence public investment became more unequal, the opposite of \nwhat happened in Bolivia. Under centralization most municipalities were concentrated in \na band between 100,000\u2013200,000 pesos\/capita, and there was a small number of \u2018winner\u2019 \nmunicipalities that received more than 300,000 pesos\/capita. By the end of the period, by \ncontrast, density in the 100,000\u2013200,000 pesos\/capita band had fallen, and there were \nfive times more \u2018winners\u2019. These changes are far less dramatic than in Bolivia, mostly \nbecause centralised government in Colombia invested much more equitably across space. \nIndeed, mean public investment by central vs. local government is almost identical.15  \nBut more detailed examination of the data shows that central resource transfers to the \nsmallest, poorest, most rural municipalities were higher after decentralisation than before. \nFigure 9 \nPre-Decentralization Investment per capita\n0\n100,000\n200,000\n300,000\n400,000\n500,000\n600,000\n0 300 600 900\nMunicipal Identity No.\nPe\nso\ns \npe\nr c\nap\nita\nMean\n \n 24\nFigure 10 \nPost-Decentralization Investment per capita\n0\n100,000\n200,000\n300,000\n400,000\n500,000\n600,000\n0 300 600 900\nMunicipal Identity No.\nPe\nso\ns \npe\nr c\nap\nita\nMean\n \nSource: Ministry of Finance, National Planning Department; original calculations. \n These statistics paint a rosy picture of Colombian reform. But decentralisation \nwas not entirely trouble-free for Colombia. During the period in question, Colombia\u2019s \nstock of public debt doubled and interest payments tripled. This formed part of a \ndeteriorating fiscal performance from the mid-1990s onwards, which led Colombia to \nsign a formal agreement with the IMF for the first time in its history in an attempt to stem \ncapital flight and ease pressure on the peso. Colombia suffered its most serious recession \nin three generations. Alesina et al. (2000) and others have blamed this fiscal deterioration \nlargely on unbalanced local-central government fiscal relationships. Did decentralisation \nlead to macroeconomic instability in Colombia, per de Mello (2000)? \nIt is a matter of record that decentralisation was followed by significant borrowing \nby sub-national governments, and then a string of bankruptcies, which ultimately cost the \nnational treasury dear. It is also true that fiscal imbalances between central and state \ngovernments in Argentina and Brazil, including especially an implicit political guarantee \nof sub-sovereign debt, contributed significantly to the recent Argentine economic \ncollapse, and to Brazilian financial instability in the late 1990s. But is important to \nremember that in Colombia the economic events in question occurred during an \n 25\nextraordinary period. Pres. Ernesto Samper (1994-1998) stood accused by the United \nStates of having been elected with drug money. As American economic sanctions took \ntheir toll and Colombians demonstrated in the streets against their government, the \nadministration undertook a comprehensive campaign to win the support of political and \nregional elites. Rather than scaling back the central state, as the very word \n\u2018decentralisation\u2019 implies, its headcount rose; national borrowing increased as the \nadministration sought to expand its base of support and survive the political storm. The \ncosts of this campaign were considerable, and added significantly to Colombia\u2019s fiscal \nwoes. Disentangling the effects of this crisis in legitimacy from those of decentralisation \nper se is a complex task. Suffice it to say that a decentralisation program with built-in, \nunnecessary fiscal imbalances contributed to Colombia\u2019s fiscal problems of the late \n1990s, but is not solely responsible for them. \n4. Conclusions and Policy Lessons \n Figure 11 summarises the key outcomes of decentralisation in both countries. \nFigure 11 \nSummary of Key Outcomes\nDecentralization...

Investment in basic social services and human capital \n 26\nformation rose strongly in both countries. In both countries, shifts in national investment \naggregates were driven by the smallest, poorest municipalities investing newly-devolved \nresources in their preferred projects. By shifting resources towards poorer districts, \ndecentralisation made investment much more equitable across space in Bolivia. \nDecentralisation made government more responsive by re-directing public investment to \nareas of greatest need \u2013 for example, Bolivian investment in education and water & \nsanitation rose after 1994 where illiteracy rates were higher and water and sewerage \nconnection rates lower, respectively. In Colombia, municipal investment rose fivefold \nwith no increase in running costs. In both countries local tax revenues increased strongly, \nalthough more so in Colombia. \n But decentralisation is no panacea. It can be done badly, and across many nations \nprobably has been. It is here that the country comparison is most informative. In Bolivia, \nthe vote was in practice more restricted than Colombia. Bolivia had further to go to make \ndecentralisation \u2013 and indeed democracy \u2013 work. Fortunately, a number of systemic \nreforms were enacted in the 1980s and 1990s which paved the way to a well-ordered \nmunicipal system. These increased transparency in the vote count, ensured voting \nsecrecy, provided for independent oversight of the voting process, and increased the \nnumber of polling stations in rural areas. But they also included non-electoral reforms, \nsuch as a new, efficient citizen registration process (which in turn permitted voter \nregistration), and the extension of rural literacy programs (especially amongst women). \nTheir collective effects were broad increases in voter registration and participation. \nBut the secret to the success of these reforms lay in large part with the design of \nthe decentralisation program itself. The LPP brought rural areas into the municipal \n 27\nsystem, and then devolved significant authority and political responsibility to them. \nWhereas before rural dwellers voted, if at all, for cantonal officials who had neither \nresources nor political power, now fully-fledged municipal governments with real \nresources and legislative authority were at stake. The prospect of gaining control over \nthese drove political parties into the countryside in search of rural votes. The prospect of \nbenefiting from them pushed villagers and farmers into municipal politics and into the \nvoting booth. \nAs evidence, consider the number of valid votes cast in municipal elections in \nBolivia. These rose by 39 per cent between 1993 and 1995, while absenteeism fell by 14 \nper cent. This implies two effects: while decentralization (1) gave registered voters a \ngreater incentive to participate, the dominant effect came through (2) registering new \nvoters, and hence including a large, new group of citizens in the political process. In this \nway, the concerns and opinions of a previously ignored sector of the population were \nbrought into the political mainstream, as electoral politics penetrated deeper and deeper \ninto the hinterland. This, then, is the first lesson: democracy and decentralisation are \ndeeply complementary, and in order for the latter to work well, the former must be \nlocally free, fair, transparent and competitive. \nThe experience of both countries \u2013 and in particular the key outcomes cited above \n\u2013 imply that elite capture did not dominate the post-reform experience in either.16  Why is \nthis the case?  The first thing to note is that there is abundant anecdotal evidence from \nboth countries of municipalities that were captured by elites, including in Colombia by \nguerrilla and paramilitary forces. Hence the question can be re-phrased as: why were \ncaptured municipalities in the minority?  Why did capture, and the effects of capture, not \n 28\ndominate the post-decentralization experience?  Our comparison implies that the \nelectoral-systemic reforms described above were complemented in both countries by \nadditional measures of consultation and representation \u2013 OCs in Bolivia, and citizens\u2019 \ninitiatives, cabildos, and Juntas Administradoras in Colombia. Together, systemic \nreforms and complementary consultation mechanisms comprised a robust system of \ncitizen accountability and control of local authorities that promoted pro-poor outcomes \nand curbed elite capture. \n The second lesson is a negative one, best illustrated in the Colombian experience. \nIn order for decentralisation to work well, sub-national governments must face hard \nbudget constraints. Reform programs featuring central guarantees of sub-national debt \u2013 \nwhether legally explicit or politically implicit \u2013 lead to fiscal imbalances that can \nultimately threaten economic stability. Colombia is a good example of this. Bolivia, by \ncontrast, shows that this problem can be overcome through good institutional design. \nThere, central government refused to guarantee municipal debt, a threat made credible by \nthe centre\u2019s weak finances, and those few cities able to borrow were left to sink or swim \nby their own devices; several sank. \nTo a large extent, hard budget constraints are implicit in the very definition of \ndecentralisation. By contrast, debt guarantees imply a continuing central intervention in \nlocal affairs that violates the functional independence that decentralisation presupposes. \nAlesina et al. suggest simply banning sub-national governments from taking on debt, \nallowing them only to \u2018borrow\u2019 against future Treasury disbursements. Another solution \ncould be strict limits on borrowing levels and maturities; a third would be for the centre \nto simply refuse to bail out local governments. This last option has proved politically \n 29\nextremely difficult in many countries, some of which have devised creative alternatives \n(Ter-Minassian 1997). In Hungary (Singh and Plekhanov 2005) and Poland (Swianiewicz \n2004), for example, implicit guarantees of local debt are combined with legal limits on \ndebt levels, and strong internal controls and auditing by the centre. The result has been \nfew problems with local bailouts, and a pattern of timely repayment. Singh and \nPlekhanov find corroborating evidence from an analysis of data from 44 countries. The \nprecise form of limits and restrictions is less important than the principle \u2013 \ndecentralisation requires hard budget constraints. \n The third lesson follows on from the second. If decentralisation means devolving \nresources, responsibility and authority from higher to lower levels of government, then it \nalso implies that the higher levels must be scaled back. The central headcount must be \nreduced, as officials are transferred to regional and local governments, or simply fired. \nBolivia did this, slashing the budgets and headcounts of its regional development \ncorporations, while Colombia did not. The consequences for Colombia were dire. Why \ndid Colombia fail where Bolivia succeeded?  The principal reason behind Bolivia\u2019s \nbehaviour is the historical weakness of its fiscal position. With a very tight budget and \nonly limited access to international debt markets, Bolivia simply could not expand local \nspending without reducing it elsewhere. This is not true of Colombia, where the state is \nbetter resourced, and the treasury has a long history of tapping international markets. \nOther deeper historical and economic differences between the two countries most \nlikely play a role. But their identification must await future research into longer time-\nspans. This is because for the period in question, such factors are overwhelmed by the \npresence of a deep crisis of legitimacy in Colombia, and its absence in Bolivia. As \n 30\nmentioned above, the logic of securing political support for an embattled administration \nprecluded scaling back central government spending, and so the Colombian state \nexpanded at all levels for several years, provoking fiscal crisis. In Bolivia, meanwhile, \ndecentralization proceeded in relative calm. \n The fourth lesson concerns the importance of devolving significant tax-raising \npowers. The point is well illustrated by Colombia, where local revenues have increased \nmuch faster than Bolivia. Local taxes are important, firstly, because they provide more \nresources for local services. Secondly, to the extent that public expenditure implies a \ndirect cost to the local economy, local policy debates will weigh competing options more \ncarefully, and better decisions will be made. If local budgets come entirely from central \ntransfers, by contrast, citizens may feel less ownership over municipal resources, and \naccordingly less interest in how they are spent. This translates into less interest in local \ngovernment, and less oversight and accountability. \n But how powers and responsibilities are devolved is also important. The reason \nthat Colombia has made more progress increasing local revenues is probably related to \nthe sequencing of reforms. Combining both political and fiscal decentralization in a \nsingle, \u2018shock therapy\u2019 treatment, as Bolivia did, risks overwhelming smaller, \nadministratively weaker municipalities. In learning their new roles and responsibilities, \npublic officials in such places naturally focus on some parts of the reform, such as the \ninvestment budget, or elections and consultations, and ignore others, such as local tax \nrevenues. This, broadly, is the story of Bolivia. Contrast with Colombia, where fiscal \nreforms that emphasized local tax revenues came first, followed by political reforms, and \nthen further fiscal and administrative reforms. Sequencing gave Colombia\u2019s local \n 31\nofficials time to focus on one aspect of a complex package, often under direct central \ngovernment tutelage, before being confronted with another. The fifth lesson, then, is that \ndecentralization is not so much a policy package as a dynamic process. It can be broken \ndown into discrete steps \u2013 for example fiscal, political and administrative. The \nsequencing of these steps is important, and paying careful attention to that sequence \nimproves outcomes. The \u2018optimal\u2019 sequence of reforms, however, is likely to differ \ncountry-by-country, depending on history and initial conditions. \n One last, sixth lesson arises from the observation that the central government \ninvested far more equitably across space in Colombia than Bolivia. Decentralisation\u2019s \neffects depend very much upon the character of the centralised regime preceding reform. \nIn both countries, decentralisation was designed to favour poorer rural municipalities. In \nColombia, this resulted in a modest re-allocation away from major cities, whereas in \nBolivia the effect was a huge fiscal equalization shock. Where central government \nallocates resources is very unequally, or very inefficiently, a decentralisation that re-\nallocates resources more neutrally will tend to have dramatic consequences. But where \nthe centre was equitable and efficient, such effects will be smaller. Where central \ngovernment is highly efficient and competent, the economic case for decentralisation \n(based on how resources are allocated) may well vanish entirely. \nGetting these lessons right is of seminal importance to any decentralisation \nprogram. Done badly, it can make government more costly and bureaucratic with little or \nno offsetting gain. But under the right circumstances, decentralizing resources and \npolitical authority can generate real accountability where none existed before, and \nimprove the quality of government a society achieves. \n 32\n                                                                                                                                                 \n1 This research was financed by the World Bank Research Committee and the DFID-LSE Crisis States \nProgramme.
