Not only have industrialised \nsocieties remained the predominant focus of attention (Power 2001), but the debates \nthemselves are rooted within an often unacknowledged western context. In addition, it is \nonly relatively recently that the issue of disability has emerged within the development \nliterature. This is perhaps surprising given the impact that human development \napproaches \u2013 which place emphasis on human beings as ends rather than means and on \nbroader notions of social well-being and justice than development as material prosperity \n\u2013 have had on studies of development. Indeed, some commentators suggest that while \nthere ought to be clear links between human development and disability issues, the latter \nhave been relatively neglected in comparison with issues such as gender justice and \nsustainability (Harriss-Whyte 1996; Baylies 2002). Attitudes towards disability in \ndeveloping countries have undoubtedly played a part in this lack of visibility, since there \n 1\nis still the notion in some places (Latin American countries are prime examples) that \nissues regarding disability are a private or at least a family matter (Gatjens 2004).\n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n                                                \n1 \n The relative neglect of disability within studies of development is even more \nsurprising given its prevalence in developing countries and its mutually constitutive \nrelationship with poverty. According to the United Nations, three quarters the world\u2019s \ndisabled people live in developing countries (Helander 1992). Impairment and, in turn, \ndisability are both causes and consequence of poverty; disabled people in developing \ncountries are often among the poorest of the poor and measures to tackle poverty are \nunlikely to be successful unless the rights and needs of disabled people are taken into \naccount (DfID 2000). While it might be assumed that achieving international \ndevelopment targets for social, economic and human development will reduce prevalence \nin many poor countries, it is only recently that development agencies and government \ndepartments (e.g. the UK\u2019s Department for International Development) have recognised \nthat specific steps are required to prevent disability, and to ensure that disabled people are \nable to participate fully in the development process and claim their rights as full and \nequal members of society. \n  In the light of this, the aims of this paper are two-fold. Firstly, the paper aims to \nbring together debates about disability and development and to trace some of the most \nsalient issues concerning disability in developing countries. Secondly, it aims to further \ndebates about the significance of geography in disability studies, to highlight some of the \nproblems with the western-centric focus of disability models and to extend understanding \nof the shifting and complex landscapes of disability in developing countries. The paper \n \n1 Indeed research in Britain has shown that such attitudes amongst members of some minority ethnic groups \nmean that they do not take up services aimed at disabled people to the same extent as white British people \n(Priestley 1995). \n 2\n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n66 \nbegins by recapitulating some of the difficulties involved in defining disability, especially \ncross-culturally, and examines some of the major criticisms within development \nliteratures about western-centric definitions. It then examines various approaches to \ndisability in the context of developing countries, drawing on literatures that have explored \nand critiqued issues of prevention, social models of disability, the significance of \ngovernment policy and rights-based approaches in developing countries and debates \nabout community rehabilitation. The paper points to a series of challenges that remain in, \nand lessons that might be learnt from, developing countries and concludes by reiterating \nthe significance of geography to the creation of more appropriate policies and practice \nwith regard to disability issues in developing countries. \n \nThe problem of defining disability \nIt is axiomatic that defining disability is fraught with problems, which are compounded in \ncross-cultural analyses of disability issues. As Whyte and Ingstad (1995, 5) argue, \u201cany \nattempt to universalize the category \u2018disabled\u2019 runs into conceptual problems of the most \nfundamental sort\u201d. Not only does the category refer to a broad range of physical, mental \nand sensory impairments, some more manifest than others, but disability is also a socio-\ncultural construction. Clearly, disability does not mean the same thing across cultures and \nover time. For example, it has been widely acknowledged that the place of disabled \npeople in industrialised societies has changed as social, cultural, economic and political \nenvironments have developed (Oliver 1990, Barnes 1991, Gleeson 1999). However, \ndefinitions of disability are required to shape policy and there is a general tension \nbetween the need, on the one hand, for internationally shared meanings that enable cross-\n 3\n67 \n68 \n69 \n70 \n71 \n72 \n73 \n74 \n75 \n76 \n77 \n78 \n79 \n80 \n81 \n82 \n83 \n84 \n85 \n86 \n87 \n88 \ncultural information exchange and, on the other hand, the need to recognise cultural \ndifferences (Stone 1999, 2). In the recent context of development, disability has been \ndefined as \u201cLong-term impairment leading to social and economic disadvantages, denial \nof rights, and limited opportunities to play an equal part in the life of the community\u201d \n(DfID 2000, 2). This definition counters the reduction of disability to medically-defined \nimpairment by recognising the social dimensions of disability, a topic to which we return \nto subsequently. \nAs Power (2001) argues, what partly defines disability in developing countries is \nthe \u2018voicelessness\u2019 and institutional neglect of disabled people who are often forced to \ntake positions on the peripheries of their societies. This is both a product of prevailing \nattitudes within these societies but can also be attributed to ways in which disability was \ninstitutionalised under colonialism. In many pre-colonial societies, disabled people were \npragmatically accommodated by what they were able to contribute to the life and welfare \nof communities. In pre-colonial southern Africa, for example, disabled children \nparticipated to varying degrees in community life by carrying water, herding cattle or \nassisting with domestic chores (Kisanji, 1995). Family and kinship ties, competence in \ndoing tasks considered useful for the household and the ability to behave in a socially \nacceptable manner determined the status and inclusion of a person within a community \n(Ingstad, 1999; Kabzems and Chimedza, 2002). Obviously, the degree and type of \nimpairment determined levels of inclusion and this is not to say that marginalisation and \npersecution did not take place, but the treatment of disabled people was often very \ndifferent in pre-colonial and colonial contexts. \n 4\n89 \n90 \n91 \n92 \n93 \n94 \n95 \n96 \n97 \n98 \n99 \n100 \n101 \n102 \n103 \n104 \n105 \n106 \n107 \n108 \n109 \n110 \n111 \nUnder colonialism, humanitarian models were imposed, with disabled children \nattending special schools run by a church or charitable NGOs. The charitable link \nprovided communities with personnel, funding and equipment that served as an \nalternative source of attitudes towards disabled people. Churches and charities very often \nfilled, and continue to fill, gaps in provision for disabled people. However, they also \nimported attitudes that emphasised medical\/charitable models of disability, development \nand service delivery; aid was usually contingent upon the adoption of the philosophy of \nthe donor or service provider and this is still very often the case (Kabzems and Chimedza, \n2002). As with \u2018development\u2019 more broadly, historically the power to define disability \nhas resided with professionals \u2013 mostly western, mostly medical, educational or \nadministrative. Recent decades have seen new and challenging definitions coming from \ndisabled people themselves but, as discussed subsequently, from mostly western, white \nand educated disabled people (Stone 1999). However, greater recognition is currently \nbeing given to the socio-cultural dimensions of disability as a means of mitigating some \nof the more problematic and often western-centric approaches. Raising the complex \nissues of socio-cultural dimensions of disability is not new (see Goffman 1963, for \nexample). However, the fact that disability is socio-culturally constructed and also \nconstitutive of social, economic, political and psychological relations between both \nindividuals and\/or institutions has considerable significance for conceptualising disability \nand development in a range of different contexts. In what follows, we explore critically a \nnumber of different approaches to disability as they relate to development more broadly, \nfocusing on what we perceive to be the central issues for rethinking disability and \ndevelopment policy and practice. \n 5\n 112 \n113 \n114 \n115 \n116 \n117 \n118 \n119 \n120 \n121 \n122 \n123 \n124 \n125 \n126 \n127 \n128 \n129 \n130 \n131 \n132 \n133 \n134 \nPrevention of impairment and disability \nThe most frequently made connection between disability and development in developing \ncountries is the link between poverty and impairment (Stone 1999). The root causes of \nimpairment in poor countries are malnutrition, poverty, landmines and lack of services \nand these hit the poorest hardest (Chambers 1983). A considerable proportion of \nimpairments in developing countries are a direct result of poverty, injustice and \ngeopolitical interventions in which industrialised countries are often deeply implicated.  \nOne example of the link between poverty and disability is childhood impairment. \nAs Bartlett (2002) argues, extraordinary numbers of children around the world are \nimpaired every year as a result of preventable injuries that occur within homes and \nneighbourhoods; the percentage of injuries per capita is much higher in the poorest \ncountries. Impairments are often a consequence of injuries caused by open fires and \nexposed kerosene heaters, unprotected stairways and heights, poor quality construction, \nlack of safe storage of chemicals and poisons, piles of debris and poor waste disposal, \nheavy traffic and a scarcity of safe play areas for children. The lack of access to \naffordable emergency health services increases the number of long-term impairments. It \nis generally acknowledged that the problem of injury-related impairment is growing in \nabsolute terms in poorer countries (see Forjuoh and Gyebi-Ofusu 1993; Sharma et al. \n1993; Zwi et al 1996; Meyer 1998; Deen et al. 1999; Guastello 1999; Krug et al. 2000; \nBartlett 2002). Evidence suggests that children living in poverty are disproportionately \naffected by injuries (Berger and Mohan 1996; Butchart et al. 2000; Laflamme and \nDiderichsen 2000). Not only are physical environments more hazardous but families are \n 6\n135 \n136 \n137 \n138 \n139 \n140 \n141 \n142 \n143 \n144 \n145 \n146 \n147 \n148 \n149 \n150 \n151 \n152 \n153 \n154 \n155 \n156 \n157 \nalso vulnerable to psychosocial stress that accompanies childhood injury; financial \nproblems, poor health and challenging living conditions also result in lower levels of \nsupervision of children. While figures are often unavailable, anecdotal evidence suggests \nthat accidents are especially common amongst working children in developing countries. \nAn ILO survey of the Philippines, for example, found that more than 60% of working \nchildren were exposed to hazards at work and, of these, 40% had suffered serious injury \n(ILO 1996 in Bartlett 2002, 3). \nIt would seem, therefore, that a large amount of disability is preventable, often \nthrough relatively simple and low-cost interventions. Measures to improve general living \nconditions and standards can have a positive effect in reducing the incidence of disability; \nimprovements in health services reduce risks and mitigate the effects of impairment when \nit occurs. Efforts to eradicate specific diseases can also have widespread and significant \neffects. The commitment by the World Health Organisation to eradicate polio, for \nexample, has had a significant impact in reducing the number of cases around the world \nfrom 350,000 in 1988 to only 5,000 in 1999 (DfID 2000). Similar health programmes \nhave been rolled out by international development agencies (e.g. the UN) to combat other \ndiseases such as leprosy, river blindness and HIV-AIDS, all of which can have severe \ndisabling effects, but it is important that these programmes do not separate issues of \ndisease eradication from underlying causes relating to poverty. Access to improved health \ncare systems that better serve the needs of the poor is critical, which includes enabling \neven the most marginalised of people to access sexual and reproductive health services. \nThat disabled people often face the greatest difficulties in accessing health care needs to \nbe considered when measures are taken to improve provision. \n 7\n158 \n159 \n160 \n161 \n162 \n163 \n164 \n165 \n166 \n167 \n168 \n169 \n170 \n171 \n172 \n173 \n174 \n175 \n176 \n177 \n178 \n179 \n180 \nOf course, impoverished people still have the greatest difficulties in accessing \nclean water supplies and sanitation; they encounter greater risks of exposure to \nenvironmental hazards and have poorer nutrition, all of which contribute to the incidence \nof impairment and long-term disability. They are often the most vulnerable to the worst \neffects of conflict and reliant on the least safe forms of transport. Any attempt to prevent \ndisability in developing countries, therefore, must deal with underlying poverty and its \nassociated risks. \n \nSocial models of disability \nIn addition to a greater focus on development policies aimed at prevention of disability, \nrecent years have witnessed a shift from medical models of disability to ones that \nacknowledge the social dimensions of disability (see, for example, Butler and Bowlby \n1997; Tregaskis 2002). For example, the International Labour Office formerly drew a \ndistinction between three concepts of disability (physical, occupational and general) (ILO \n1989, 74). This was a medical\/occupational method of assessing disability and the effect \non earning capacity and was criticised because its point of departure was a non-disabled, \nemployed person who became disabled through accident, injury or disease; it made no \nprovision for a person born disabled or becoming disabled before having an opportunity \nto enter the labour market. Equally, this model of disability centralised western medical \nknowledge and thus reflected the \u201cpostcolonial paternalism\u201d (Lee 1997) of many \ninternational debates about disability. More recently, the ILO Code of Practice on \nManaging Disability in the Workplace, adopted in 2001 by experts from developing and \nindustrialized countries, recognizes the \u201cneed for definitions to reflect the social \n 8\ndimensions of disability, be in harmony with human rights principles\u201d and allows for \n\u201cvariation in national interpretations of disability\u201d \n(\n181 \n182 \nhttp:\/\/www.ilo.org\/public\/english\/employment\/skills\/disability\/download\/adhoc.doc). 183 \n184 \n185 \n186 \n187 \n188 \n189 \n190 \n191 \n192 \n193 \n194 \n195 \n196 \n197 \n198 \n199 \n200 \n201 \n202 \n203 \n These shifts in international definitions reflect the success of disability activism, \nprimarily in industrialised countries. Social models of disability, which see the problem \nnot as located in the individual, but in a society, economy, political system and culture \nthat fails to meet the needs of disabled people, was developed primarily by British \ndisabled people and activist allies. Disability, in this sense, is social disadvantage and \ndiscrimination and in order to make a change in disabled people\u2019s lives there is a need to \nchange society and the way society treats people who have impairments. Whilst the term \n\u2018the social model\u2019 has become \u201ca gloss for a range of theoretical and methodological \ncommitments\u201d(Dewsbury et al 2004: 145), these commitments are rooted in specific \nnotions of civil rights, the need for inclusion and the removal of disabling barriers to full \nparticipation. It is significant that the recent ILO statement acknowledges that while \nsocial models are appropriate for politicised disabled people in industrialised countries, \nthey might be inappropriate elsewhere. As critics have argued, imposing western-centric \nsocial models of disability in developing countries without consideration of local \nhistorical and cultural practice would be more like imperialism than empowerment (Miles \n1992; Stone 1997).  \nMost, if not all social models are based on the assumption of the availability of \ntechnical and environmental solutions, in addition to cultural shifts, which have resource \nimplications. Even in relatively wealthy industrialised countries where such models have \nbeen developed and embraced, disabled people do not have full entitlement because of \n 9\n204 \n205 \n206 \n207 \n208 \n209 \n210 \n211 \n212 \n213 \n214 \n215 \n216 \n217 \n218 \n219 \n220 \n221 \n222 \n223 \n224 \n225 \n226 \ncosts to individuals, institutions and arenas of government (Oliver 1990). Caution is thus \nrequired when exploring the wider relevance of disability debates grounded in particular \ncultural values and geographical spaces. For example, Komardjaja (2001a; 2001b) argues \n(primarily in the context of Indonesia) that western-centric debates about accessibility \nand barrier-free environments are less relevant than the need to enhance the general \nquality of life for disabled people, including reducing illiteracy, increasing access to \ninformation, and participation in economic and political decision-making. Clearly, issues \nfor disabled people in developing countries are profoundly different to those in \nindustrialised societies. In developing countries, it is rare to see ambulant disabled people \nusing mobility aids such as leg braces, crutches, walking canes and wheelchairs. As \nKomardjaja (2001b) argues, for impoverished disabled people the streets are the places \nmost suitable for begging. Generally, disabled people in such contexts are not \npedestrians; rather, they are on the streets for specific purposes, often related to \nsurvivalist strategies. Sidewalks along main roads and thoroughfares are strategic sites for \neconomic activities of low-income and informal traders who hardly leave space for \npedestrians (Ballard and Popke, 2003). Therefore, concerns with access are not always \nappropriate in such contexts, where disabled people are preoccupied with coping and \nsurviving. These debates bring international classifications and universalising models of \ndisability under scrutiny, particularly if they inform policies that might be ignorant of \ngeographical and cultural differences. \nThere are questions, therefore, about whether current social models that have been \nformulated in industrialised countries are appropriate in developing countries, where \nresource constraints are extreme and where issues of prioritising are urgent. Social, \n 10\n227 \n228 \n229 \n230 \n231 \n232 \n233 \n234 \n235 \n236 \n237 \n238 \n239 \n240 \n241 \n242 \n243 \n244 \n245 \n246 \n247 \n248 \n249 \neconomic and political structures may be common concerns, but the forms, causes and \nthe resulting salient issues for disabled people differ. The issue of poverty is again \nsignificant. There are greater disabling barriers that prevent disabled people in poorer \ncountries from acquiring education, employment and access to appropriate support and \nservices. Some barriers are rooted in local attitudes to disability; others are rooted in \nbroader structural processes of poverty and injustice, but it has only recently been \nrecognized that \u201clocal and global factors impact on perceptions of and responses to \nimpairment and disability\u201d (Stone 1999, 6).  \nReflecting some of these concerns, a number of authors (for example, Butler and \nBowlby 1997, Hughes and Patterson 1997, Imrie 2004) have argued that both medical \nand social models, while capturing aspects of disabled people\u2019s lives, are problematical \nfor failing to recognise that biology and society (including its culture, economy and \npolitics) are entwined in a dialectical relationship. This implies that: \nphysical and mental impairment, in contributing to functional limitations of \nbodies, cannot be discounted as ephemeral in the construction of disability and \ndisabled people\u2019s lives. Rather, a focus on interactions between functionally \nimpaired bodies and socio-cultural relations and processes is seen, by some, as \ncrucial in the development of a non-reductive and non-essentialised understanding \nof disability (Imrie 2004: 288). \nAs Imrie argues, these ideas are gaining ascendancy in a range of important \ndevelopmental contexts, most notably in the World Health Organisation\u2019s (WHO 2001) \nInternational Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health. This seeks to develop \nthe conception that \u201cmind, body, and environment are not easily separable but rather \n 11\n250 \n251 \n252 \n253 \n254 \n255 \n256 \n257 \n258 \n259 \n260 \n261 \n262 \n263 \n264 \n265 \n266 \n267 \n268 \n269 \n270 \n271 \n272 \nmutually constitute each other in complex ways\u201d (Marks 1999, 25) and conceives of \ndisability as \u201ca compound phenomenon to which individual and social elements are both \nintegral\u201d (Bickenbach et al. 1999, 1177). This is clearly an important development in \ninternational understandings of disability. However, as Imrie suggests, there is still a lack \nof clarification on the definition of impairment and the principle of universalisation as the \nbasis for disability health and social programmes remains questionable. The shifting and \ncomplex terrain of disability in developing countries brings these issues into sharp focus. \n \nRights-based approaches \nOne positive aspect of social models of disability is that they provide an opportunity for \ncross-cultural differences in the interpretation of disability to be accommodated in our \nunderstanding. This has helped raise the significance of how societies interpret and react \nto disability and the importance of tackling discrimination towards disabled people. \nConsiderable gains have been made by activists in some developing countries in the field \nof civil rights, which in turn also places emphasis on the significance of government \npolicy within developing countries. Two well-documented examples are South Africa and \nUganda. \nDisability issues came to prominence in South Africa during the political \ntransformation in the early 1990s, when minority groups were quick to organise and seize \nthe opportunity to shape new state institutions and the nature of democracy being \nconstructed. Disability activists were among these minority groups lobbying hard for \nrecognition and guarantees of rights and equality within the new dispensation. As a \nconsequence of high visibility and activism, the Office of the Status of Disabled Persons \n 12\n273 \n274 \n275 \n276 \n277 \n278 \n279 \n280 \n281 \n282 \n283 \n284 \n285 \n286 \n287 \n288 \n289 \n290 \n291 \n292 \n293 \n294 \nwas established in the Office of the President and is thus located at the heart of \ngovernment. The National Co-ordinating Committee on Disability (NCCD) played a key \nrole in the establishment of the Disability Program and the drafting of the 1997 White \nPaper on Integrated National Disability Strategy, which aims to create an enabling \nenvironment that will lead to the full participation and equalisation of opportunities for \npersons with disabilities. The OSDP has also developed mechanisms and capacities to \nfacilitate the integration of disability issues into government development strategies, \nplanning and programmes, as well as the coordination, monitoring and evaluations of \nthese at national, provincial and local government levels. One of its main activities has \nbeen to train previously marginalised disability groups in effective advocacy skills. \n Protection against the contingency of disability is provided through the \nConstitution, primarily via the anti-discrimination clause, which protects all people \nagainst direct and indirect discrimination. Disability is mentioned as one of the arbitrary \ngrounds, undoubtedly a product of disability activism, which presented itself as a \nmovement for full citizenship rights. Despite this, disabled people in South Africa face \nhigh levels of inequality and discrimination and labour and social security laws continue \nto define disability with reference to a particular medical model (Truter 2001). For \nexample, Section 1 of the Employment Equity Act (1998) defines disabled people as \n\u201cpeople who have long-term or recurring physical and mental impairments which \nsubstantially limit their entry into or advancement in employment\u201d. Despite this, the \nlegislation has been significant in allowing disabled people to claim their rights as \ncitizens. \n 13\n295 \n296 \n297 \n298 \n299 \n300 \n301 \n302 \n303 \n304 \n305 \n306 \n307 \n308 \n309 \n310 \n311 \n312 \n313 \n314 \n315 \n316 \n317 \nThe 1998 Employment Equity Act is important in prohibiting unfair \ndiscrimination against disabled people and providing for affirmative action measures. \nThese include modifying or adjusting jobs and working environments to accommodate \ndisabled people and numerical goals to address under-representation in the workplace. \nThe public sector was required to achieve a 2% level of employment of disabled persons \nby 2005, while bigger employers have to register employment equity and skills \ndevelopment plans setting numerical targets in terms of race, gender and disability \n(Rowland 2002). The 1999 Skills Development Levies Act aims to improve the \nemployability of those who find it difficult to enter the labour market, particularly people \nfrom previously disadvantaged groups, including disabled people. However, the \nDepartment of Labour has set equity targets for skills development initiatives at only 4% \nof disabled people (Cape Business News 2001), which does not equate with lowest \nestimates of disability within South Africa.  \nThe South African government has attempted to reform other laws to counter \npersistent inequalities. Both the White Paper for Social Welfare (1997) and the White \nPaper on an Integrated National Disability Strategy (1997) acknowledge that South \nAfrica\u2019s security system has in the past not operated in the interest of disabled people. \nThe former foresees the formulation of a policy on social security for disabled people and \nthe government has endorsed the World Programme of Action concerning Disabled \nPersons, the UN Standard Rules and the UN Charter on Rights for People with Mental \nHandicaps (White Paper 1997, 22). This represents a major change in government \nthinking on disability issues in accordance with international developments. A wide range \nof issues, such as public transport, employment, accessible communication, integrated \n 14\n318 \n319 \n320 \n321 \n322 \n323 \n324 \n325 \n326 \n327 \n328 \n329 \n330 \n331 \n332 \n333 \n334 \n335 \n336 \n337 \n338 \n339 \n340 \neducation and the restructuring of social security benefits are addressed. It acknowledges \nthat social security legislation tends to be discriminatory towards disabled people and sets \nas the objective a social security system that meets their needs. This includes an \nappropriate assessment method, accessible information and payout facilities, proper \nadministration, effective feedback mechanisms and a co-ordinated social security safety \nnet (White Paper, Ch 2). In addition, a National Environmental Accessibility Programme \nis underway, focusing on rural areas, education and employment (Power 2001).  \n The case of Uganda is also notable in that disabled people have achieved a higher \nlevel of political representation than in any other country (Ashton 1999, cited in DfID \n2000). Like South Africa, Uganda has a relatively new constitution that provides for the \nrepresentation of the disability movement at all levels of political administration. At \nparliamentary level, five seats are reserved for disabled people, one for each of the four \nregions of Uganda and one representing the interests of women with disabilities. \nMoreover, in local elections, at all levels of government, there has to be at least one \nrepresentative with a disability. This prominence within government is seen as essential \nto ensuring that the needs of disabled people are fully articulated within government \npolicy. \n Whilst the rights-based social model adopted on paper in some developing \ncountries appears to be progressive, there are still significant questions over the \npossibilities of delivering what is promised. These questions to some extent revolve \naround the limitations of social models discussed previously, particularly in terms of \npoverty, access to resources and a profound rural-urban divide in many developing \ncountries. Even in relatively resource-rich countries like South Africa, it is difficult to see \n 15\n341 \n342 \n343 \n344 \n345 \n346 \n347 \n348 \n349 \n350 \n351 \n352 \n353 \n354 \n355 \n356 \n357 \n358 \n359 \n360 \n361 \n362 \n363 \nhow disabled people living in impoverished rural communities, where there are \nsignificant technology and service provision gaps, will be able to claim their rights under \nrecent legislation or to improve the circumstances in which they live. Many Latin \nAmerican and Caribbean countries have only recently approved disability legislation, but \nthere is still very little effective compliance (Gatjens 2004).  \n The macro-economic context in which developing countries have to operate also \nraises doubts about the possibilities of translating progressive legislation into reality for \ndisabled people. South Africa, for example, has undergone what various critics have \ndescribed as a self-imposed structural adjustment (Bond 2000; Marais 1998; Hart 2005), \nwith the effect that the progressive welfarist and redistributive policies have been \nsuperseded by a neo-liberal macro-economic policy. This raises questions about the \neffects of a restricted social welfare budget on populations dependent on social welfare, \nespecially those with disabilities. In many developing countries where progressive \nlegislation has been adopted the biggest obstacle to change appears to be the private \nsector, which has been slow to include, promote and address the legacy of discrimination \nagainst disabled people. \nThe key issue for developing countries is whether, in a neo-liberal macro-\neconomic context, the guarantees to equality within constitutional and progressive \nlegislation can be translated into de facto improvements in the lives of disabled people. If \nsocial models are seen as the solution, which imply a level of state spending on \nimproving technology and access to resources, there are questions about whether this will \nbe possible given enormous budgetary constraints. In sub-Saharan African countries, in \nparticular, the effects of HIV\/AIDS and economic globalisation have the potential for \n 16\n364 \n365 \n366 \n367 \n368 \n369 \n370 \n371 \n372 \n373 \n374 \n375 \n376 \n377 \n378 \n379 \n380 \n381 \n382 \n383 \n384 \n385 \n386 \nnegative impacts on the welfare of disabled people. Kabzems and Chimedza (2002) point \nout that in South Africa, for example, there is already less talk of world class facilities for \ndisabled people and more talk of the \u201ccommon good\u201d \u2013 trying to prevent disabilities \nthrough providing access to clean drinking water, immunisation programmes and injury \nprevention. \nSocial models also recognise that further constraints are created by existing \ncultural barriers, which are not likely to be overcome by legislation and policy alone. \nSocial acceptance and attitudes are both reflected and constantly reinforced by the \nvocabulary employed to refer to individuals with disabilities. Many southern African \nlanguages, for example, use prefixes designated for noun classes referring to objects of \nanimals when referring to individuals with disabilities (Devlieger, 1998) \u2013 spoken and \nwritten language reinforces their marginalisation within society. In many sub-Saharan \nAfrican countries negative cultural attitudes persist, where disability in children continues \nto be associated with maternal wrongdoing, witchcraft, evil spirits, or divine punishment \n(Kabzems and Chimedza, 2002). A family might be accused of \u201csacrificing\u201d the child in \nexchange for good crops or a father will accuse his wife of promiscuity in order to deny \nhis part in the \u201ccreation\u201d of disabled child (ibid. 151). And in many developing countries \naround the world, international aid agencies have perpetuated the public perception that \ndisabled people are a burden in need of support from charitable organisations and \nexternal agencies; it is not surprising, therefore, that negative attitudes exist within \ncommunities where resources are scarce. Thus, although the civil rights of disabled \npeople in some developing countries are increasingly protected, cultural barriers still \nremain and are continually reinforced. One remaining positive factor, however, is that in \n 17\n387 \n388 \n389 \n390 \n391 \n392 \n393 \n394 \n395 \n396 \n397 \n398 \n399 \n400 \n401 \n402 \n403 \n404 \n405 \n406 \n407 \n408 \n409 \ncountries where progressive policies have been adopted civil society structures have also \nbeen put in place and can play a major role in lobbying and advocacy. Awareness \ncampaigns, which receive some state support, have some potential in empowering \ndisabled people (Gleeson 1999) and advocacy is important in changing attitudes (Parker \n2001). \n \nCommunity-based rehabilitation \nIn some ways related to debates about cultural barriers, community-based rehabilitation is \nan approach that has grown out of the debate between social and medical models of \ndisability. It attempts to combine physical rehabilitation through medical intervention and \ncare with empowerment and social inclusion through the participation of disabled people, \nas well as their communities, in the process of rehabilitation. This has often been claimed, \nparticularly by aid agencies and development organisations, to be the most effective way \nof making use of scarce resources and of socially integrating disabled people. Emphasis \nis placed on participation, active community support, specialist medical inputs and \nindigenous knowledge and practices. Advocates believe it empowers individuals to take \naction to improve their own lives, but critics are numerous. \nPerhaps most obviously, concerns have been raised that negative institutional \npractices and attitudes have, in many cases, simply been relocated into communities \n(DfID 2000). In addition, aid agencies advocating these approaches are often unaware of \nearlier, imperialist attempts to rehabilitate disabled people. As Miles (2001) argues, they \noften accept the conventional mythology that \u201cnothing was done for disabled people\u201d \nbefore a phase of \u201cinstitution-building\u201d in the 1960s, which they now wish to replace \n 18\n410 \n411 \n412 \n413 \n414 \n415 \n416 \n417 \n418 \n419 \n420 \n421 \n422 \n423 \n424 \n425 \n426 \n427 \n428 \n429 \n430 \n431 \n432 \nwith \u201ccommunity-based\u201d rehabilitation and \u201cinclusion\u201d. They thus ignore the fact that \ncommunity-based rehabilitation, very much the fashion since the 1980s, is simply an \nupdated, less obviously imperialistic version of missionary responses in the 1890s (Stone \n1999). They might be well-meaning, but they are often insensitive and inappropriate to \nlocal practices and perceptions. Most importantly, these schemes often under-estimate the \nsupport of families and communities already in existence for disabled people (Rao, \n2001). Disability service developments are often dominated by the disparate trends of \nEuropean countries funding them. For example, Scandinavian countries have been active \ninternationally in promoting disability issues in southern Africa starting with \nnormalisation, integration and community-based services and inclusion. Policy affirms \nthe need to include persons with disabilities at all levels and stages of projects. Yet, as \nKabzems and Chimedza (2002, 149) point out: \u201cIt remains rare for a person with a \ndisability to be on the project payroll, whether in the capacity of consultant, accountant or \ntea lady\u201d. \nThis lack of user involvement in planning in disability and development appears \nto be widespread despite stated policies to the contrary. A study by Flower and Wirz \n(2000) explores how selected European-based international non-governmental \norganizations (INGOs) facilitate the participation of disabled people in their planning \nprocess. While INGOs involve disabled people\u2019s organizations (DPOs) in their planning \nof services and projects this is most commonly through sharing information rather than \nthrough consulting with them, including them in decision-making or supporting action \ninitiated by them. The study found that if there is no assurance that ideas raised will be \nimplemented, then there is no guarantee of the participation of DPOs in the planning \n 19\n433 \n434 \n435 \n436 \n437 \n438 \n439 \n440 \n441 \n442 \n443 \n444 \n445 \n446 \n447 \n448 \n449 \n450 \n451 \n452 \n453 \n454 \n455 \nprocess of INGOs. Yet despite failing in facilitating participation, INGOs have helped to \nstrengthen DPOs, encouraging their formation and making disability an issue that cuts \nacross sectoral boundaries. This might facilitate the participation of disabled people in the \nplanning process of INGOs in the future, but there is still a long way to go. \nMany critics argue that models of community-based rehabilitation and inclusion, \nimported from countries with much stronger economies and longer histories of universal \nprimary education, child-centred education, and educational research, have seldom been \nculturally or conceptually appropriate to the countries in which they have taken place (see \nMiles 1996; Lorenzo 2003; Metts and Metts 2003; Millward et al. 2005). Rao (2001) \nargues that the status of disabled people in the majority world is complex and there is \ngreat variability in the ways in which they are treated. Thus: \nit is worthwhile to understand the indigenous ways in which disabled people have \nbeen accommodated. Recognising the differences in social, cultural and historical \ncontexts may be critical in implementing inclusion initiatives, which are culturally \nappropriate (ibid., 533).  \nIt remains the case, however, that external ideologies are often imposed that do not \nnecessarily match local practices and attitudes towards disabled people. As Kabzems and \nChimedza (2002, 150) point out, \u201cthe years of bilateral support do not seem to have \nelicited contemporary, locally rooted, competing conceptualisations of disability\u201d.  \n \nRemaining challenges: lessons from developing countries \nA number of challenges remain in developing countries concerning the social and \neconomic inclusion of disabled people. How disability activists, governments, aid \n 20\n456 \n457 \n458 \n459 \n460 \n461 \n462 \n463 \n464 \n465 \n466 \n467 \n468 \n469 \n470 \n471 \n472 \n473 \n474 \n475 \n476 \n477 \n478 \nagencies and society at large respond to these will continue to be instructive. As this \npaper has demonstrated, one major concern is that models aimed at incorporating \ndisability into development policy and practice are often devised in advanced economic \ncontexts and, consequently, are too tightly focused on urban-based populations and \nenvironments. For example, the initial work of United Nations Economic and Social \nCommission for Asia and the Pacific region (UNESCAP) has been to empower urban-\nbased persons with disabilities in mainstream facilities (Parker, 2001). In recognizing the \nproblems with this in developing countries, a long-term strategic intention is to work to \nraise disability issues in rural areas; this will be a more holistic approach and will include \nother social and developmental issues such as child labour, exploitation and poverty \nalleviation. In this sense, then, UNESCAP is responding to the need to include all \ndisabled persons in the development process (see also Turmusani (2003) on participatory \nresearch with disabled people and Jordan and Parker (2001) on efforts towards \nparticipation and inclusion in the more developed Asian economies). A further challenge \nis ensuring that debates within poorer countries can inform development strategies, but \nfirst there needs to be an understanding of what these debates are and an assessment of \ntheir potential to inform broader policy and practice. The legislative changes in South \nAfrica and Uganda, and the positive effects these have had in driving the disability rights \nagenda and energising civil society organisations are instructive in this regard.  \n Importantly, formal citizenship in South Africa incorporates a notion of cultural \ncitizenship (Stevenson, 2001), in which cultural rights are added to civil, political and \nsocial rights. Cultural rights are related to identity and are based on \u201cthe right to be \ndifferent while enjoying full membership of a democratic and participatory community\u201d \n 21\n(ibid. 2); they \u201cherald a new breed of rights claims for unhindered representation, \nrecognition without marginalisation, acceptance and integration without \u2018normalising\u2019 \ndistortion\u201d (ibid. 3). For disabled people, this is of significance since against this \nbackdrop, legislation does not simply seek to \u2018normalise\u2019 them as productive contributors \nin the formal economy (cf. Erevelles\u2019 case study of South India (2001) and Shang\u2019s \ndiscussion of employment policies for disabled people in urban China (2000), but to \ncreate conditions for acceptance and integration on their terms as disabled people).  \n479 \n480 \n481 \n482 \n483 \n484 \n485 \n486 \n487 \n488 \n489 \n490 \n491 \n492 \n493 \n494 \n495 \n496 \n497 \n498 \n499 \n500 \n501 \n Challenges also remain concerning acknowledgement within policy and practice \nof the interconnections between gender and disability (Lorenzo 2003). Until recently, \nthere has been little consideration by theorists of disability of the ways in which gender \nmight structure the experience of disability (Morris 1994; 1996). Equally:  \nIt is quite absurd that international development programs rarely address the needs \nof disabled women. Women with disabilities are harassed sexually, exploited by \nmen, suffer abject poverty and social disrespect, malnutrition, disease and \nignorance (Safia Nalule in Mobility International USA 2002). \nIn spite of critical need, women with disabilities are under-represented and under-served \nin every aspect of the international development field: as partners, staff and beneficiaries \nof development schemes. In addition, in much of southern Africa, Latin America and the \nCaribbean, disability has been the concern of a voiceless minority \u201ccared for\u201d largely by \nwomen (Miles 2001); in South Asia women in most settings are more likely than men to \nexperience as well as report poor health and functional impairments but little is known \nabout the association between gender, marital status, co-residence with sons, and \ndisability (Sengupta and Agree, 2002).  \n 22\n502 \n503 \n504 \n505 \n506 \n507 \n508 \n509 \n510 \n511 \n512 \n513 \n514 \n515 \n516 \n517 \n518 \n519 \n520 \n521 \n522 \n523 \n524 \n Women with disabilities traditionally have not had access to economic \ndevelopment initiatives, even those targeting women. Micro-credit programmes use \nselection criteria, lending procedures and training facilities that discriminate against \nwomen, primarily because of a lack of accessibility, and disabled women often do not \nhave access to vital health information, particularly HIV\/AIDS prevention. Coping with \ndisability is a much tougher proposition for women because of unequal access to income-\ngeneration opportunities, through male bias in planning and the way that providing care \nfor disabled people is constructed as an exclusively female concern (Snyder 1995). As \nPower (2001) points out, there are important links between the assumed passivity of \ndisabled people and the assumed passivity of women; the struggle against social stigma is \nthus more complex for women. The South African legislative and policy context, \nhowever, recognises these links and, at least on paper, is progressive; both international \ndevelopment programmes and debates within industrialised countries could learn from \nthis approach. \n Similarly, Uganda has adopted a Universal Primary Education policy to provide \nall children with access to basic education (DfID 2000). The policy provides free \neducation for four children per family, two of which must be girls (where there are girls) \nand any children with a disability. This represents considerable progress in a context \nwhere the education of disabled children might previously have been considered a waste \nof resources. India also has a District Primary Education Programme in place that seeks \nto include disabled children in mainstream schools. This is aimed at providing an \neducation for disabled children while challenging the stigma and negative stereotypes \noften associated with such children (ibid.). While significant challenges still remain \n 23\n525 \n526 \n527 \n528 \n529 \n530 \n531 \n532 \n533 \n534 \n535 \n536 \n537 \n538 \n539 \nconcerning policy, infrastructure, issues of empowerment, cultural attitudes, visibility, \nand the effects of conflict on disability, positive steps are being taken in many developing \ncountries, incorporating the lessons learned from other contexts, but combining these \nwith an understanding of local difference, and having the potential to effect more \nappropriate policies. \n \nConclusions \nThe need to prioritise disability issues in development policy is increasingly recognised. \nFor example, the UK government Department for International Development recently \nlaunched a Disability Knowledge and Research Programme and has collated a directory \nof key information resources entitled \u201cDisability, development and inclusion\u201d. This is \naimed at organisations working with disabled people in developing countries and covers a \nwide range of themes including human rights, gender, poverty and mainstreaming, as \nwell as planning and management of disability programmes and service delivery relating \nto children, community-based rehabilitation, mental health and HIV\/AIDS (see \nwww.asksource.info\/res_library\/disability.htm). However, in planning and practice by \ndevelopment organisations disability remains relatively neglected. South Africa, Uganda \nand India are examples where relatively poor countries have attempted to tackle head on \nissues of disability rights and human development, drawing primarily on social models \nthat are now embedded in international frameworks but increasingly recognising the \nimpacts of local factors that limit practical implementation of these. They are also noting \nthe importance of local-level understandings and needs. Each context is, of course, \nunique and this needs to be acknowledged when attempting to draw lessons from their \n540 \n541 \n542 \n543 \n544 \n545 \n546 \n547 \n 24\n548 \n549 \n550 \n551 \n552 \n553 \n554 \n555 \n556 \n557 \n558 \n559 \n560 \n561 \n562 \n563 \n564 \n565 \n566 \n567 \n568 \n569 \n570 \nprogression of disability issues. However, they suggest that prioritising the meeting of \nbasic human needs and assuring social justice and equity need to precede addressing \nissues of access for disabled people. This is particularly relevant, as Komardjaja (2001b, \n101) argues, in cultures of coping, tolerance and survival where marginalization is less of \nan issue than it might be in industrialised countries.  \n What sets disability issues in developing countries apart is that it is difficult to \nencounter them without conceptualising disability as a product of both the traumatic \nprocesses of colonialism and the often problematic construction of postcolonial national \nidentities. This is particularly the case in Africa, where, as Quayson (2002, 228) argues: \n [W]ars and rumours of war succeed in proliferating disability on the streets  \ndaily. Angola, Mozambique, Liberia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone. In all these countries \nreckless wars have ensured that the disabled are part of everyday life. In any \nattempt to create a civil imagining in these countries, the problem will always be \nhow to confront a traumatic history of disability at the personal as well as the \nsocial level. \nThere is thus a need for a more holistic and flexible approach to understanding disability, \nwith a greater focus on local and individual experience and on recognising the importance \nof geopolitical, social and cultural as well as economic contexts. This is one welcome \nlesson from social models of disability. However, individual experience is constituted by \nbiology (being a body of flesh and blood), social discourse (including ideas about \n\u2018normal\u2019 bodies), interactions with social constructs, other people and institutions (Butler \nand Bowlby 1997). The fact that these factors differ spatially suggest that models of \ndisability also need to be flexible. \n 25\n571 \n572 \n573 \n574 \n575 \n576 \n577 \n578 \n579 \n580 \n581 \n582 \n583 \n584 \n585 \n586 \n587 \n588 \n589 \n590 \n591 \n592 \n593 \nFinally, what is striking about much international debate is a failure to recognise \n\u2018development\u2019 itself as potentially disabling. As Power (2001) argues, to do so is to begin \nto open up quite profound questions about the margins of \u2018development\u2019 and its impulse \nto objectify the marginal. Indeed, \u201cTo add disability to a development agenda as if it was \nsome kind of cumulative list of needs means that the underlying ableist assumptions of \ndevelopment remain unchallenged\u201d (ibid. 95). Related to this is a need to theorise \ndevelopment and disability in both local and global contexts, for both a deeper \nunderstanding of disability issues by those involved in the development field and of \ndeveloping world issues by those involved in the disability field (Stone 1999). There is \nalso a need for greater networking between those involved in disability and development \nin poorer countries (Hurst 1999), which would greatly enhance the possibilities of \ntheorising from these contexts and producing more locally appropriate policies and \npractice.  \n \nReferences: \nBallard R and Popke J 2004 Dislocating modernity: identity, space and representation \nof street trade in Durban, South Africa Geoforum 35 1 99-110 \nBarnes C 1991 Disabled people in Britain and discrimination: a case for anti-\ndiscrimination legislation Hurst and Co, London \nBartlett S 2002 The problem of children\u2019s injuries in low income countries: a review \nHealth Policy and Planning 17 1 1-13 \nBaylies C 2002 Disability and the notion of human development: questions of rights and \ncapabilities Disability and Society 17 7 725-39 \n 26\nBerger LR and Mohan D 1996 Injury control: a global view New Delhi Oxford \nUniversity Press \n594 \n595 \n596 \n597 \n598 \n599 \n600 \n601 \n602 \n603 \n604 \n605 \n606 \nBickenbach J, Chatterji S, Badley E and Ustun T 1999 Models of disablement, \nuniversalism and the international classification of impairments, disabilities and \nhandicaps Social Science and Medicine 48 1173\u20131187 \nButchart A, Kruger J, Lekoba R and Smith D 1996 Evaluating injury prevention \noutcome in a developing country context: lessons from a community-based violence \nprevention programme Urbanisation and Health Newsletter 29th June 28-42 \nButler R and Bowlby S 1997 Bodies and spaces: an exploration of disabled people\u2019s use \nof public space Environment and Planning D: Society and Space 15 4 411-33 \nBond P 2000 Elite Transition: From Apartheid to Neo-Liberalism in South Africa Pluto, \nLondon \nCape Business News Disabled people ask for equality 26\/11\/01 \nhttp:\/\/www.cbn.co.za\/issue\/11120103.htm 607 \n608 \n609 \nCASE 2002 \u2018We also Count\u2019.
