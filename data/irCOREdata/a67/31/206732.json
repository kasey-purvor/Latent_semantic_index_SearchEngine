The index \ncaptures six institutional prerequisites for legislative control, relating to amendment \npowers, reversionary budgets, executive flexibility during implementation, the timing of \nthe budget, legislative committees, and budgetary information. Various methods of index \nconstruction are reviewed. The results reveal substantial variation in the level of \nfinancial scrutiny of government by the legislature among contemporary liberal \ndemocracies. The US Congress has an index score that is more than three times as great \nas those for the bottom nine cases, predominantly Westminster systems. Even allowing \nfor US exceptionalism, the top quartile legislatures score twice as high on this index as \nthe bottom quartile. These findings suggest that the power of the purse is a discrete and \nnon-fundamental element of liberal democratic governance. For some countries it is a \nkey safeguard against executive overreach, while others maintain a constitutional myth. \n \n 2 \n \nThis power over the purse may, in fact, be regarded as the most complete and \neffectual weapon with which any constitution can arm the immediate \nrepresentatives of the people, for obtaining a redress of every grievance, and for \ncarrying into effect every just and salutary measure.   Publius, Federalist 58 \n \nThe requirement for legislative approval of financial measures is a democratic foundation \nstone that is enshrined in constitutions around the world.1 Despite this widespread formal \nrecognition, the actual budgetary role of national legislatures apparently differs sharply \nacross countries. Members of the US Congress \u2018have long seen themselves as the \nbulwark against [executive] oppression\u2019 and their \u2018major weapon\u2019 is the constitutional \nrequirement for congressional approval of appropriations (Wildavsky and Caiden, 2001, \np. 10). Scholars and practitioners agree that the US Congress is a powerful actor that can \nhave decisive influence on budget2 policy (Wildavsky, 1964; Schick, 2000; Meyers, \n2001). On the other hand, the budgetary influence of legislatures is said to be marginal in \nseveral other industrialised countries including France and the UK (Chinaud, 1993; \nSchick, 2002). Existing comparative work on legislative budgeting contributes selected \ncase studies (Coombes, 1976; LeLoup, 2004), but lacks systematic analysis on the basis \nof a common framework. Moreover, while the literature on the US Congress is extensive, \nlegislative budgeting in parliamentary systems and developing countries in particular \nremains understudied (Oppenheimer, 1983). As a basis for more systematic comparative \nwork, this paper proposes and applies an index of legislative budget institutions that can \nbe used to assess and compare the budgetary power of national legislatures. \n \n 3 \nA number of authors refer to the cross-national distribution of legislative power over the \npurse (Coombes, 1976; Meyers, 2001; Schick, 2002), but few have constructed \nquantitative measures. Although some previous studies present indices of budget \ninstitutions, these pay only limited attention to legislative variables. Fiscal \ninstitutionalists are concerned with explaining fiscal performance, typically public debt \nand deficits, with the design of the budget process (Kirchg\u00e4ssner, 2001). Most of this \nliterature does not exclusively focus on the role of the legislature, but a broader selection \nof variables that are said to promote fiscal discipline in budgetary decision-making. Von \nHagen\u2019s (1992, p. 70) pioneering index includes one composite item on the structure of \nthe parliamentary process that considers notably the amendment powers of a legislature. \nAlesina et al. (1999) construct an index of budgetary procedures with two out of ten \nvariables as indicators of the relative position of the government vis-\u00e0-vis the legislature, \nnamely amendment powers and the nature of the reversionary budget (see also Hallerberg \nand Marier, 2004). Other studies focus exclusively on the fiscal effect of specific \nlegislative institutions (e.g. Crain and Muris, 1995; Heller, 1997). \n \nLienert (2005) offers a broader consideration of legislative budget institutions. His index \nof legislative budget powers covers five variables, namely parliament\u2019s role in approving \nmedium-term expenditure parameters, amendment powers, time available for the \napproval of the budget, technical support to the legislature, and restrictions on executive \nflexibility during budget execution. This provides a basis for more systematic \ncomparative analysis of legislative budgeting, but also raises some methodological issues. \nFor example, there is hardly any variation on the first variable, the legislature\u2019s role in \n 4 \napproving medium-term spending plans. Only one out of 28 legislatures in the sample \nformally passes a law on the medium-term strategy (Lienert, 2005, p. 22). This lack of \nvariation calls into question the usefulness of this item as a comparative indicator. In \naddition, the differential weighting of variables is not explicitly motivated. In short, what \nis missing so far is a broader measure of legislative budget institutions that is based on a \nthorough discussion of relevant indicators and methodological issues. \n \nThe aim of this paper is to present a comparative framework to assess legislative budget \ncapacity that can be applied, potentially, to any national legislature in a modern \ndemocracy. I suggest a series of variables that are combined into an index to measure \ncross-country variation in legislative budgeting and deliver an empirical application \nbased on survey work by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development \n(OECD) and the World Bank. More specifically, the paper asks which institutional \narrangements facilitate legislative control over budgets. A crucial assumption is thus that \ninstitutional arrangements reflect the budgetary power of a legislature. \u2018Control\u2019 is here \ndefined as the power to scrutinise and influence budget policy and to ensure its \nimplementation. As Wildavsky and Caiden (2001, p. 18) remind us: \u2018Who has power \nover the budget does not tell us whether or not the budget is under control.\u2019 The question \nof whether legislative power over the budget is fiscally desirable is explicitly excluded \nfrom this paper. While some argue that limiting parliamentary involvement is conducive \nto fiscal discipline (Poterba and Von Hagen, 1999; Strauch and Von Hagen, 1999), other \nstudies highlight the risks of weak legislative scrutiny (Burnell, 2001; Santiso, 2004). The \n 5 \ndebate will not be settled in this paper, which primarily aims at providing a fresh \nconceptual and empirical basis for engaging with this issue in follow-up research. \n \nI proceed as follows. In the first section I outline and explain the selection of the \nvariables included in the index, and section two gives an overview of the data used. \nSection three discusses issues related to index construction and selects a method for use \nin this paper. I conduct a number of experiments to check the robustness of the index. \nSection four presents an overview of the results in the form of a ranking of legislatures. I \nuse two approaches to validate the index. The first is to compare the resulting ranking \nwith findings from case study literature and the second is to test the association of the \nindex with an indicator of legislative amendment activity. The conclusion summarises the \nmain results and highlights implications. \n \n \nVariables \n \nThe construction of an index for the purpose of cross-national comparison requires the \nidentification of essential differences. Invariably, some of the richness of qualitative \nanalysis has to be forfeited to gain a tractable tool for comparative research, which is \nnecessary to venture beyond particular cases in order to discover broader patterns. No \nsingle variable can be considered sufficient on its own and I make no claim to cover \nevery potentially relevant variable. Rather, the paper adopts an approach based on \nassessing the institutional capacity for legislative control (Meyers, 2001, p. 7). I argue \n 6 \nthat the presence of a critical number of institutional prerequisites, including formal \nauthority and organisational characteristics, is necessary to facilitate budgetary control. \n \nAmendment powers. The nature of formal powers to amend the budget determines the \npotential for legislative changes to the budget policy proposed by the executive (Inter-\nParliamentary Union, 1986, Table 38A).3 Most constraining are arrangements that \ndisallow any amendments to the executive\u2019s proposal and merely give a legislature the \nchoice between approval and rejection of the budget in its entirety. Also severely \nrestrictive are \u2018cuts only\u2019 arrangements that only allow amendments that reduce existing \nitems but not those that shift funds around, increase items, or introduce new ones. This \nprecludes a creative budgetary role for the legislature. More permissive are powers that \nallow some amendments to the budget as long as the aggregate totals or the deficit in the \ndraft budget are maintained. This enables engagement with budget priorities while \nprotecting executive fiscal policy. Finally, most permissive are unfettered powers of \namendment. Here, a legislature has full authority to cut, increase, and reallocate. \n \nReversionary budgets. The reversionary budget defines the cost of non-approval by \nspelling out what happens should legislative authorisation be delayed beyond the \ncommencement of the fiscal year. Alesina et al. (1999, p. 258) use the reversionary \nbudget in conjunction with legislative amendment powers to assess the relative position \nof the government vis-\u00e0-vis the legislature. If the reversionary outcome is far from the \nexecutive\u2019s preferred budget, then there is potential for the legislature to extract \nconcessions in return for approval. In the extreme case of reversion to zero spending, the \n 7 \nexecutive is likely to prefer a compromise to the possibility of no supply and hence \ngovernment shutdown. Conversely, when the executive budget proposal takes effect, the \nexecutive has no incentive to avert non-approval. Reversion to last year\u2019s budget \ntypically constitutes an intermediate case. \n \nExecutive flexibility during implementation. Provisions that allow flexibility during \nbudget execution enable the executive to alter spending choices following the approval of \nthe budget by the legislature. One mechanism is impoundment, which allows the \nwithholding of particular funds that have been appropriated by the legislature. Another is \nvirement, i.e. the ability of the executive to reallocate or transfer funds between budget \nitems during the execution of the budget. Finally, some executives can introduce new \nspending without legislative approval (Carey and Shugart, 1998). If the executive can \nwithhold funds, transfer between items, and initiate fresh funding without the consent of \nthe legislature, it has significant leeway to unilaterally alter the approved budget, which \ndiminishes legislative control over implementation. In effect, such powers constitute \namendment authority in reverse, and in extreme cases allow the executive to undo \nlegislative choices during implementation (Santiso, 2004). \n \nTime for scrutiny. Time is a precious resource given a typically tight and crowded \nlegislative calendar (D\u00f6ring, 1995). Budgets take many months to put together and a \ncouple of weeks are insufficient to make sense of such complex sets of information. \nInternational experience suggests that the budget should be tabled at least three months in \nadvance of the fiscal year to enable meaningful legislative scrutiny (OECD, 2002a). The \n 8 \ntiming of scrutiny partly depends on how effectively a legislature can control its own \ntimetable and the legislative agenda, but it may also reflect constitutional prescriptions. \n \nCommittee capacity. A well-developed committee system appears to be \u2018at least a \nnecessary condition for effective parliamentary influence in the policy-making process\u2019 \n(Mattson and Str\u00f8m, 1995, p. 250). The importance of legislative committees is widely \nrecognised, although their primary function is disputed between proponents of \ndistributive, informational, and partisan explanations (Shepsle, 1979; Krehbiel, 1991; \nCox and McCubbins, 1993). Here, I note several benefits of committee structures. First, \nthey establish a division of labour that facilitates specialisation and the development of \n\u2018legislative expertise\u2019 (Mezey, 1979, p. 64). Second, committees allow parliaments to \ndeal with various matters simultaneously, and hence increase productivity. These benefits \nare crucial for the budget process, which requires the processing of substantial volumes \nof information. Moreover, committees can play an important role in monitoring \nimplementation (McCubbins and Schwartz, 1984). Legislative approval only matters \nwhen budgets are meaningful. Otherwise, budgetary drift allows the government to get \nwhat it wants irrespective of what the legislature approved. Committees with a \nspecialised monitoring function, in particular audit committees, help to detect \nimplementation failures and improve compliance (McGee, 2002). In short, a well-\ndesigned committee structure enables budget scrutiny and oversight of implementation. \n \nAccess to budgetary information. Finally, budgetary decision-making requires access to \ncomprehensive, accurate and timely information. Crucial for this is the breadth and depth \n 9 \nof supporting documentation that accompanies the budget figures submitted to the \nlegislature. In addition, in-year revenue and expenditure updates as well as high quality \naudit reports, including performance audits (Pollitt, 2003), are crucial types of \ninformation for legislative oversight of budget implementation. Key standards for budget \nreporting are set out in the OECD Best Practices for Budget Transparency (OECD, \n2002a). Still, an executive monopoly on budgetary information can put the legislature at a \nsevere disadvantage, as it is easy to manipulate budget figures and limit disclosure \n(Wildavsky and Caiden, 2001, p. 78). The benefits of an independent legislative budget \noffice include that it can help to simplify complexity and make the budget accessible for \nlegislators, enhance accountability through its scrutiny of executive information, and \npromote transparency by discouraging \u2018budgetary legerdemain\u2019 (Anderson, 2005, p. 2). \n \nThere are, of course, other variables that might possibly be included. For instance, Von \nHagen (1992) considers the confidence convention. Notwithstanding a legislature\u2019s \nformal constitutional powers to amend the budget, in some parliamentary systems any \nchange to the executive\u2019s draft budget is by convention considered a vote of no \nconfidence in the government (e.g. Bl\u00f6ndal, 2001, p. 53). In effect, the confidence \nconvention reduces legislative authority to a stark choice between accepting the budget \nunchanged or forcing the resignation of the government and fresh elections. I exclude this \nvariable on grounds of parsimony. The confidence convention is most common in \nWestminster type systems that in any case restrict legislative powers to amend the \nbudget, such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the UK (OECD, 2002b, p. 159). As \n 10 \namendment powers are already included in the index, this variable suffices to signal \nrestrictions on legislative policy-making. \n \nAlso, some presidential systems counterbalance legislative powers over the budget with \nexecutive veto authority that typically can only be overridden with a heightened \nlegislative majority. Package vetoes allow the executive to veto entire bills passed by the \nlegislature, while a line item or partial veto allows the president to reject individual items \nin a bill. Some authors give great importance to veto authority in assessing executive \npower over policy (e.g. Shugart and Haggard, 2001, pp. 75-7). However, the power a \npackage veto gives to the executive critically depends on the reversionary budget, which \nis already part of the index. For instance, if spending is discontinued without an approved \nbudget in place, then to veto the budget would be a very extreme measure that the \nexecutive is likely to use only in extraordinary circumstances (Williams and Jubb, 1996). \nIn addition, line item vetoes are exceptionally rare at the national level. Shugart and \nHaggard (2001, p. 80) find that only two out of 23 countries with pure presidential \nsystems use a version of the line item veto, namely Argentina and the Philippines. For \nthese reasons, I exclude executive vetoes from the index. \n \n \nData \n \nDuring 2003 the OECD in collaboration with the World Bank conducted the Survey on \nBudget Practices and Procedures, which was administered to specially identified budget \n 11 \nofficials in each participating country. The dataset for this paper draws heavily on the \nresults of this survey, which are available online. The survey covers 27 OECD members \nas well as 14 other countries. Some of the non-OECD countries have limited democratic \ncredentials and are excluded from the scope of this paper.4 The data are unique in that a \nsimilarly comprehensive budget system survey had not been previously carried out for \nsuch a large number of countries. On the other hand, responses were not always \nrigorously checked and in certain cases the quality of the data is questionable. The data \nused in this paper were double-checked as extensively as possible against information \nfrom online sources, such as finance ministry and parliamentary websites, as well as \nprevious survey results (OECD, 2002b). Where necessary clarification was sought from \ncountry experts who are identified in the acknowledgements. In the following paragraphs, \nI discuss the specific data used for the construction of the index. The full dataset is \nreproduced in Appendix 1 and Appendix 2 details the construction of two composite \nvariables. I also document any adjustments to the original OECD data. \n \nFollowing Alesina et al. (1999, pp. 257-8), all variables are coded on a range between \nzero (the least favourable from a legislative perspective) and ten (the most favourable). \nThe maximum figure is divided equally between the categories. Later on, in the next \nsection, I conduct some robustness checks to see whether this coding procedure \nsignificantly affects the ranking of legislatures compared with alternative methods. In the \nfollowing, I indicate the score I give for each response option in square brackets. \n \n 12 \nThe OECD (questions 2.7.d and 2.7.e) asked respondents to indicate whether legislative \npowers of amendment are restricted, and if so, which form the restrictions take. I code the \nanswers in four categories, i.e. the legislature may only accept or reject the budget as \ntabled [0], it may cut existing items only [3.3], it may shift funds as long as a specified \naggregate constraint is met [6.7], or it has unfettered powers [10]. \n \nThe survey (question 2.7.c) also asked after the consequences should the budget not be \napproved at the start of the fiscal year. I group the responses into four categories: the \nexecutive budget [0], vote on account [3.3], last year\u2019s budget [6.7], or no spending [10]. \nThe second category requires elaboration. Historically, the English Parliament devised \nthe tactic of voting appropriations near the end of the session to force economies on the \nCrown and to extract concessions (Schick, 2002, p. 18). This historical rationale is now \nobsolete, but delayed approval nonetheless remains the norm. Formally, supply would \ncease without an approved budget in place. In practice, the parliaments of the OECD \nCommonwealth countries routinely approve interim spending, which is referred to as a \n\u2018vote on account\u2019 in the UK.5 Some might argue that this system preserves the threat of \nreversion to zero spending, but my judgment is that this practice is so standardised and \npredictable that it would be misleading to assign a score of ten. \n \nExecutive flexibility is tested by combining three items. The OECD asked whether there \nis scope for appropriations to be reallocated from one programme to another without \nparliamentary approval (question 3.2.a.4), whether the executive may withhold funds that \nare appropriated, but not available on a legal or entitlement basis, without legislative \n 13 \nconsent (question 3.1.c), and whether the annual budget includes any central reserve \nfunds to meet unforeseen expenditures (question 3.2.c.1). I assign each answer a score of \n3.3 if it is negative, as a positive answer implies executive flexibility to vire, impound, \nand authorise fresh funds respectively. The sum of the scores for each case can range \nbetween zero and ten and is interpreted as an indicator of executive flexibility during \nbudget execution. Appendix 2 provides full details. \n \nThe OECD also asked (question 2.7.b): \u2018How far in advance of the beginning of the fiscal \nyear does the executive present its budget to the legislature?\u2019 and provided four response \noptions, i.e. up to two months [0], two to four months [3.3], four to six months [6.7], and \nmore than six months [10]. \n \nData on the role of parliamentary committees in budget approval are available in the \nOECD survey (question 2.10.a). The survey also asked whether audit results are \ncirculated and discussed in Parliament (question 4.5.m), but the answer categories are \nambiguous with regard to the nature of committee engagement with audit findings. \nTherefore, data on parliamentary audit committees were gathered in a separate survey of \nparliamentary websites that was conducted during January 2004. I distinguish the \ninvolvement of three sets of specialised committees and give equal scores [3.3] to each \ncategory, i.e. a budget or finance committee, sectoral or departmental committees, and an \nex post audit committee. For instance, if a parliament uses a finance committee and \nsectoral committees for budget approval, as well as an audit committee for ex post \nscrutiny of audit findings, it gets the highest possible score of ten, and without any \n 14 \ncommittee involvement a score of zero. Involvement of sectoral committees gets a score \nof 3.3 only if they have actual authority over departmental budgets, but not if they are \nmerely consulted or submit non-binding recommendations while a finance or budget \ncommittee retains full authority. Also, if a legislature uses an audit-subcommittee of the \nbudget committee for the purpose of parliamentary audit, I assign half the available score \nfor this item [1.7]. Refer to Appendix 2 for full details. \n \nLegislative access to budgetary information is very difficult to assess. It was not possible \nto use the survey results to construct a reliable and fine-grained measure of the quality of \nbudgetary information supplied by the executive. However, most of the countries \nincluded in this analysis are OECD members and hence subscribe to the Best Practices \nfor Budget Transparency (OECD, 2002a). In addition, studies confirm that several non-\nOECD countries in the sample provide high quality budgetary information, for instance \nChile (Bl\u00f6ndal and Curristine, 2004), Slovenia (Kraan and Wehner, 2005), and South \nAfrica (F\u00f6lscher, 2002). Therefore, it is reasonable to assume adherence to a common \nminimum standard for budgetary documentation in most cases. However, one of the key \ndifferences between countries is the level of legislative budget research capacity \n(question 2.10.e). I distinguish legislatures without such research capacity [0] from those \nwith a budget office of up to ten professional staff [2.5], 11 to 25 [5], 26 to 50 [7.5], and \nmore than 50 [10]. The last category acknowledges the uniqueness of the US \nCongressional Budget Office, which has about 230 staff (Anderson, 2005). \n \n \n 15 \nConstructing the Index \n \nThe task of index construction raises in particular theoretical questions about the \nsubstitutability of components. In this section, I first discuss various possible methods for \nindex construction and then compare the results in order to check the robustness of the \nindex. The starting point for this discussion is the additive index. This frequently used \nmethod consists of summing up all scores for a given case in order to derive the index \nscore for that case (e.g. Lienert, 2005; Von Hagen, 1992). The simple sum index can be \nrepresented as a special case of the following formula (Alesina et al., 1999, p. 260): \n\u2211\n=\n=\n6\n1i\nj\nij cI  \nThe term ci captures the value of component i and j is a power term that can be adjusted \nto reflect different assumptions about substitutability. If j = 1, then we get the simple sum \nindex. If 0 < j < 1, this favours cases with consistently intermediate scores over those \nwith a mixture of high and low scores, i.e. this approach assumes a limited degree of \nsubstitutability. Conversely, with j > 1, a greater degree of substitutability is assumed, \nsince high scores are rewarded. In addition, it would be possible to allow differential \nweights for each of the components. However, this is not implied by the theoretical \napproach, so I do not pursue this possibility here. \n \nTo assume complete non-substitutability, the components can also be multiplied. This \ntypically generates highly skewed distributions, because a single low score substantially \ndrags down the index. Since the majority of cases included in this study have scores of \nzero on at least one of the components, this method does not yield useful results. Nor \n 16 \ndoes it appear theoretically plausible to assume complete non-substitutability for all \ncomponents. In addition, this method is highly sensitive to small mistakes in the data, \nwhich can lead to severe misrepresentation of the affected cases. These are strong reasons \nfor rejecting the purely multiplicative approach for this analysis. \n \nI propose a third method, which is based on sub-indices: \n\u220f\n=\n=\n2\n1k\nks sI , where \u2211\n=\n=\n3\n1\n1\ni\nics  and \u2211\n=\n=\n6\n4\n2\ni\nics  \nHere, sk represents two sub-indices, each consisting of the sum of three different \ncomponents, which are then multiplied. It is possible to again incorporate a power term \ninto the formulas for the sub-indices, but most essential is the underlying approach. The \nrationale for this index is as follows. Variables one to three (amendment powers, \nreversionary budgets and executive flexibility) can be interpreted as formal legislative \nauthority vis-\u00e0-vis the executive. Amendment powers and reversionary budgets are \nfrequently stipulated in constitutions, and organic budget laws typically regulate \nflexibility during implementation (Lienert and Jung, 2004). In contrast, variables four to \nsix (time, committees and research capacity) are taken to represent the organisational \ncapacity of the legislature. Assuming that both formal powers as well as organisational \ncapacity are necessary for effective scrutiny, this calls for multiplication of the two sub-\nindices. However, within each sub-index at least a degree of substitutability is plausible. \nFor instance, if committees are weakly developed, then this lack in division of labour \nmight be compensated by using a lot of time to scrutinise the budget or by delegating \nscrutiny to a well-resourced parliamentary budget office. Similarly, even when \n 17 \namendment powers are limited, the legislature may still be effective in extracting \nconcessions from the executive if spending reverts to zero in the case of non-approval. \n \n[TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE] \n \nI proceed to check the robustness of results. Table 1 contains the Spearman rank \ncorrelations between four alternative indices, which are labelled according to their \nsubscripts in the above formulas. I use the simple sum index with j = 1 computed with the \nfirst formula and two other arbitrary numbers for the power term, i.e. j = 0.5 (half the \nvalue of the simple sum version) and j = 2 (double the value), to consider the impact of \ndifferent substitutability assumptions. The fourth index labelled s is calculated using the \nsecond formula based on the two sub-indices. All of the correlations between these four \nversions of the index are positive and very strong. The lowest coefficient is .86 between \nthe two indices that use extreme values for j, which is expected. Overall, the results are \nvery robust. For this reason, I use the simple sum index in the remainder of the paper.  \n \n \nDiscussion and Analysis \n \nThis section presents the index of legislative budget institutions and discusses main \nresults. For presentational purposes, I rescale the index to range between zero and 100. \nThe resulting ranking is presented in Figure 1. To evaluate the index, I pursue two \napproaches. First, I briefly consider whether the results are broadly in line with case study \n 18 \nliterature. Second, I check the validity of the index by testing its association with a simple \nindicator of legislative amendment activity. \n \n[FIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE] \n \nThe US Congress emerges as an outlier by a substantial margin. Its score is more than \nthree times as great as those for the bottom nine cases, predominantly Westminster \nsystems. According to the index the US Congress is the only legislature with the \ninstitutional foundation to exercise very strong influence over public finances. The \nimportance of Congress in the US budget process is widely acknowledged. Aaron \nWildavsky\u2019s seminal work on the politics of the budget process is, in essence, a study of \ncongressional policy-making (Wildavsky, 1964; Wildavsky and Caiden, 2001). Although \nthe US President submits a draft budget this does not bind Congress in any way (Schick, \n2000, pp. 74-104). Oppenheimer (1983, p. 585) concludes a wide-ranging literature \nreview with the observation that Congress is \u2018the most influential legislature\u2019 in policy-\nmaking. The index is in line with this judgment. \n \nOn the other extreme, the UK case is often said to epitomise the decline of parliaments \n(Einzig, 1959; Reid, 1966; Adonis, 1993). In a recent paper, Allen Schick (2002, p. 27) \ngoes as far as to claim: \u2018Nowhere is the budgetary decline of parliament more noticeable \nthan in Britain\u2026 [The] House of Commons, the cradle of budgetary democracy, [has] \nlost all formal influence over revenues and expenditures.\u2019 In 1998-99 the Procedure \nCommittee of the House of Commons bluntly referred to its power over expenditure as \u2018if \n 19 \nnot a constitutional myth, very close to one\u2019 (quoted in Walters and Rogers, 2004, p. \n257). While we have no time series data to test the decline thesis, the index confirms that \ncurrent capacity in the UK Parliament is extremely limited. The rankings of other \nparliaments with a Westminster heritage are very similar, which again is supported by \ncase study evidence. For instance, in Canada members characterise legislative scrutiny of \nthe budget as a \u2018cursory review\u2019, \u2018a total waste of time\u2019, and \u2018futile attempts to bring \nabout change\u2019 (quoted in Bl\u00f6ndal, 2001, p. 54). Another example is the paper by \nKrafchik and Wehner (1998), which highlights the great difficulty of the South African \nParliament in transcending its Westminster heritage in the post-apartheid environment. \n \nFew national legislatures have been as extensively studied as the US Congress and the \nUK Parliament, but nonetheless we can assess some other rankings against the literature. \nNotably, the Danish, Norwegian and Swedish parliaments achieve relatively high scores \non the index. This corresponds with literature that has pointed out the distinctiveness and \nrelative strength of these parliaments (Arter, 1984; Esaiasson and Heidar, 2000; Wehner, \n2007). In addition, a large number of cases fall in between the extremes of the US \nCongress and Westminster type legislatures. Notably, continental European parliaments \nmake up much of the middle mass on the index. Case study work shows that in a number \nof these countries, parliaments retain a limited level of influence on budgets.6 It is beyond \nthe scope of this paper to present a full literature review. Still, this brief comparison with \nsome of the case study literature suggests that the index generates plausible scores. \n \n 20 \nThe validity of the index can also be tested statistically. Given that the index captures \ninstitutional preconditions for legislative control, it should be associated with a measure \nof policy influence. One such indicator is amendment activity. The OECD asked \n(question 2.7.i): \u2018In practice, does the legislature generally approve the budget as \npresented by the executive?\u2019 Eleven out of 36 respondents in this sample indicated that it \n\u2018generally approves the budget with no changes\u2019. More finely grained measures of \namendment activity would be preferable, such as the number of amendments and their \nmagnitude, but comprehensive data are not available. Also, it is true that a legislature \nmay not have to amend the budget to impact on policy. Hidden actions such as a short \nphone call from a powerful committee chair to an executive official can be important \nmeans of legislative influence (Meyers, 2001, p. 7). Moreover, the executive may \nanticipate legislative reactions and fashion the draft budget accordingly, thereby reducing \nthe likelihood of amendments. However, it would be naive to conclude that the absence \nof amendments indicates that the legislature is getting its way. An executive has no \nreason to be responsive to legislative preferences unless the absence of such \nconsideration has consequences. For example, in the UK the last government defeats over \nestimates date back more than 80 years.7 I argue that legislative actors need to maintain a \nmodicum of amendment activity in order to signal to the executive their capacity for \nsubstantial revision should the draft budget not take sufficient account of their \npreferences. \n \n[TABLE 2 ABOUT HERE] \n \n 21 \nAccepting the above premise, one would expect budget-amending legislatures to have \nmore developed institutional capacity. I use a t-test to assess whether index scores are \nhigher for budget-amending legislatures compared with those that do not amend the \nbudget (Bohrnstedt and Knoke, 1994, p. 139). Setting \u03b1 = .05 for 34 degrees of freedom \ngives a critical value of 1.7 for a one-tailed test to reject the null. Based on the data in \nTable 2 we obtain a value of 2.3, which falls within the rejection region. This supports \nthe prediction that budget-amending legislatures maintain higher levels of institutional \ncapacity for financial scrutiny. \n \nThe evidence in this section is mutually reinforcing and confirms that the index is a \nuseful summary indicator of legislative capacity to influence budget policy. The ranking \nis broadly in line with case study literature and the index is positively associated with a \nsimple measure of legislative impact on public finances. Not too much should be read \ninto small score differences between national legislatures, as the index makes no \nqualitative statements on the margin. Nonetheless, whether a legislature ranks towards \nthe top, middle, or bottom of the index conveys an overall perspective on the state of \nlegislative budgeting in a particular country. Indeed, if the power of the purse is a sine \nqua non for legislative control in general, then the results also reflect the overall status of \nthe legislature in the political system of a country. \n \n \nConclusions \n \n 22 \nThis paper has expanded the methodological toolkit for cross-national research on the \nlegislative power of the purse. Previous efforts to construct quantitative measures of \nlegislative budget power were either extremely limited in their coverage of relevant \nvariables or neglected detailed discussion of related methodological issues. The index \nconstructed here is robust and delivers results that can be checked against case study \nevidence and using statistical tests. It provides a sound basis for investigating cross-\nnational patterns in legislative budgeting, their causes and consequences. However, I do \nnot suggest that quantitative analysis should be a substitute for the detailed study of \nparticular cases. Rather, there is an emerging debate on comparative research methods \nthat argues strongly in favour of a carefully designed combined use of statistical and \nsmall-N approaches (Lieberman, 2005). For instance, large-N analysis can provide the \nbasis for a more deliberate choice of case studies, which in turn may deepen \nunderstanding and add important contextual variables. \n \nThe empirical results of this analysis raise questions about the prerequisites for \ndemocratic governance. Despite widespread constitutional recognition of the importance \nof legislative control over the purse, this paper reveals substantial variation in the level of \nfinancial scrutiny of government by the legislature among contemporary liberal \ndemocracies. The US Congress has an index score that is more than three times as great \nas those for the bottom nine cases, predominantly Westminster systems. Even allowing \nfor US exceptionalism, the top quartile legislatures score twice as high on this index as \nthe bottom quartile. In between the extremes of Westminster and the US Congress, \ncontinental European parliaments make up much of the middle mass of the ranking. To \n 23 \nwhat extent legislative involvement or the absence of effective checks and balances \nimpose costs is an empirical question to be tackled in follow-up research. The findings \npresented here suggest that the power of the purse is a discrete and non-fundamental \nelement of liberal democratic governance. For some countries it is a key safeguard \nagainst executive overreach, while others maintain a constitutional myth. \n 24 \nReferences \n \nAdonis, A. (1993) Parliament Today.

Additional comments where responses were missing or ambiguous:  a) Provision in an \nestimate passed by the Dail does not convey authority to spend without sanction of the Minister for Finance.  b) Author\u2019s \nresearch.  c) Reallocations between operating appropriations are allowed.  d) Reallocations are allowed for the Public \nInvestment Programme and with the approval of the Ministry of Economy and Finance.  e) There can be transfers with the \napproval of the central budget authority or the legislature depending on budgetary classification.  f) Most transfers require \napproval by the legislature, some only notification.  g) Sectoral committees in the Senate examine and report on relevant \nareas of the budget.  h) The Finance and Expenditure Committee scrutinises the Budget Policy Statement and Estimates. \nOther committees may debate the estimates and policy for specific departments.  i) Based on Walters and Rogers (2004).  \nj) The Appropriations Committees in both houses operate elaborate subcommittee structures.  k) Budget committee with \nan audit subcommittee.  l) The Evaluation and Control Delegation of the Finance Commission in the National Assembly \nhas tried to improve interaction with the Court of Audit.  m) Standing Order 31A establishes a Special Standing Committee \non Financial Statement and General Balance Sheet of the State.  n) The Public Accounts Committee was abolished in \n1962.  o) The Commission for Budgetary and other Public Finance Control receives audit reports, but in the past it has \ndealt with very few of them (Kraan and Wehner, 2005).  p) There is a Commission for Relations with the Tribunal of \nAccounts, but its role is limited. \n 37 \n \n \n1 Refer to the International Constitutional Law website, which includes references to the financial \nprovisions of various constitutions: http:\/\/www.oefre.unibe.ch\/law\/icl\/ [last accessed May 2005]. \n2 Definitions of the budget differ across countries. The use of the word in the UK now refers to the Spring \nFinancial Statement, which focuses on taxation measures. In many countries, however, the term has a \nbroader meaning that is captured in the first traceable legal definition of the budget in a French decree of \n1862: \u2018The budget is a document which forecasts and authorizes the annual receipts and expenditures of the \nState\u2026\u2019 (quoted in Stourm, 1917, p. 2). I use the word in this broader sense. \n3 In virtually all countries the executive prepares a draft budget that is then submitted to the legislature for \napproval (Schick, 2002). The US Congress held out longest compared with other legislatures before \nestablishing an executive budget process, until in 1921 the Budget and Accounting Act required the \nPresident to coordinate the drafting of a budget proposal to be submitted to Congress (Webber and \nWildavsky, 1986, pp. 411-6). \n4 Several countries included in the survey have low scores on the 2003 Freedom House combined average \nratings. I use 3.5 as a somewhat arbitrary cut-off point and exclude Cambodia, Colombia, Jordan, Kenya \nand Morocco. The ratings are available at http:\/\/www.freedomhouse.org [last accessed May 2005]. \n5 This practice is referred to as \u2018interim supply\u2019 in Canada, \u2018supply\u2019 in Australia, and \u2018imprest supply\u2019 in \nNew Zealand. \n6 Coombes, 1976; Eickenboom, 1989; Chinaud, 1993; Leston-Bandeira, 1999; LeLoup, 2004. \n7 In 1919 the Commons, in what the Chancellor criticised as a \u2018virtuous outburst of economy\u2019, denied the \nLord Chancellor funding for a second bathroom and other amenities, and in response Lord Birkenhead \nrefused to move into his official residence. The last government defeat over estimates was in 1921, when \nmembers\u2019 travelling expenses were the objects of criticism (Einzig, 1959, pp. 274-5). \n"}
