Principally most of the work to date has\nbeen focused on correlating Acoustic Emission (AE) activity to the defect condition\non rolling element bearings with limited investigations on hydrodynamic bearings. In\ndeveloping the AE technology for monitoring hydrodynamic bearings operated under\nvariable speed and load conditions it is essential that a relationship between the\noperational variables and the generation of AE is established. This paper presents\nexperimental tests aimed at understanding the influence of speed and load on\ngeneration of Acoustic Emission in a hydrodynamic bearing. It is concluded that the\npower losses associated which such bearings has a direct influence on the generation\nof AE.\nKeywords: Acoustic Emission, Condition monitoring, Hydrodynamic bearing.\n1. Introduction\nAcoustic Emission (AE) is defined as the range of phenomena that results in the\ngeneration of structure-borne and fluid-borne propagating waves due to the rapid\nrelease of energy from localised sources within and\/or, on the surface of a material\n[1]. The typical frequency content of AE is within the range of 100 kHz to 1 MHz.\nThe AE technology is continually developing into a complimentary technology to\nother condition monitoring technologies such as vibration analysis [2, 12-29 ].\nIn the application of AE to hydrodynamic bearings (journal bearings) Sato [3] was the first\ninvestigator that directly addressed monitoring the integrity of such bearings with AE.\nTypical problems that are associated with journal bearings include wear and metal wipe\nwhich is a direct consequence of the shaft making contact with the journal. Such frictional\ncontact is a prime source of AE. Others [4 to 8] have applied the AE technology to shaft-\nseal rubbing in large power generation turbines. Leahy et al [9] undertook the most\nrealistic controlled verification of applicability of AE to shaft seal rubbing and Al-\nShaikh Mubarak et al [10] attempted to apply the technology for monitoring blade\nrubbing. Whilst in all the cases highlighted above the measurement of AE was predominately\nmade at the journal bearing housing, no attempt was made to understand the factors that\ngovern the generation of AE within the bearing as a function of the operational variables such\nas load, film thickness and speed. The aim of this investigation is to ascertain the\nrelationship between rotational speed, applied load, theoretical film thickness and AE\nr.m.s for hydrodynamic bearing, which hitherto has not .been explored.\n2. EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAMME\nThe hydrodynamic bearing test rig employed for this study had an operational speed\nrange of between 500 to 4000 rpm . The test bearing had a radius of 40 mm, length of\n80mm and a recommended radial clearance of 0.04 mm. The bearing was lubricated\nwith Castrol Magna BD 68 (ISO 32) with a base oil kinematic viscosity at 40\u00b0C and\n100\u00b0C of 68cSt and 8.8cSt respectively. For these tests a maximum load of 800N was\napplied. One of the fundamental reasons for testing under very lightly loaded\nconditions was to ensure that a minimum film thickness of the test bearings was much\nlarger than the surface roughness of the bearing (3\u00b5m Ra).\nTwo Physical Acoustics Pico type sensors (200 KHz to 750 KHz frequency\nbandwidth) were placed directly onto the test bearing at each end, see figure 2. The\nsensor output was amplified at 40 dB. The \u2018PICO\u2019 type sensor was employed due to\nits size (5 mm in diameter and 5 mm in height) making it suitable for placement in\nconfined areas.\nFigure 1 Test rig layout\nIn addition, two thermocouples used for measuring the journal temperature during the\ntests were welded onto the bearing race adjacent to the AE sensors. The test\nconditions investigated included five rotational speeds 500, 1000, 2000, 3000 and\n4000 rpm and six load conditions, 300N, 400N, 500N, 600N, 700N and 800N.\nLoading was accomplished by placing weights onto a load plate linked to the rotating\nshaft either side of the test bearing, see figure 1. As such for a test condition of 800N,\n400N force was applied to each loading plate. Acoustic Emission r.m.s values were\ncalculated in real time by the analogue-to-digital converter over a time constant of\n10milli-seconds and at a sampling rate of 100 Hz. AE waveforms were sampled at\n2MHz.\nFigure 2 Location of AE and thermocouple sensors on test bearing\nFor this investigation tests involved varying the applied bearing load for fixed\nrotational speed whilst recording the AE r.m.s activity; each load condition was\ninvestigated under near constant temperatures. This was done in an attempt to\neliminate the influence of temperature during the tests. Prior to performing the tests,\nthe temperature of the test bearing was raised to approximately 40\u00b0C; this was\nachieved by running the test-rig in excess of 1000 rpm at 100N. As soon as the\ndesired temperature was reached, the test sequence began. The test involved running\nthe bearing at five rotational speeds and increasing the radial load, starting at 150N,\nand increasing the load in 50N increments every 5-minutes to a maximum of 400N.\nThe five speed conditions investigated were, 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 rpm.\nThe test simulations under each load and speed condition was maintained at 5-minutes\nas longer operation would have significantly comprised the authors attempts to\nAE sensor\nmaintain near isothermal conditions. Over 4 experimental tests programmes were\nundertaken where the experimental procedure described was repeated.\n3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS\nThe results of this test are presented in figures 3, 4 and 5. Figure 3 highlights\nobservations of theoretical minimum film thickness (h0) and AE r.m.s measured on\nthe bearing for a fixed speed condition. It is evident is that an increase in load resulted\nin a decrease in theoretical minimum film thicknesses and a corresponding increase in\nmeasured AE r.m.s values. This highlighted the sensitivity of the AE technology is\ndiscriminating such small differences in film thickness. Also It must be noted that\nduring these test conditions, the temperature varied by a maximum of approximately\n\u00b13\u00b0C. All calculations of minimum film thickness and power losses were based on\nwell established procedures [11].\nFrom figure 4, it was noted that the change in load had a negligible influence on the\nlevel of AE activity for that particular speed condition, however, the change in\nrotational speed increased AE levels significantly even though the actual predicted\nchange in minimum film thickness with increased speed was of the order of less than\n1% for the tests conditions (see table A1 in Appendix). The corresponding increase in\nAE levels from changes in speed were in the order of over 150% on average, see table\nA2 in the Appendix. The authors attribute this significant change to the shearing\neffect of the lubricant which is a function of the rotational speed. As with\nhydrodynamic bearings there is no asperity contact and the corresponding increase in\nAE levels is attributed to the friction associated with the shearing of the lubricant. The\nvalues of AE r.m.s and minimum film thickness presented in figures 3 and 4 were\nobtained by averaging all AE r.m.s and ho values measured and calculated over the\nspecific load condition.\nObservations showed AE levels increased with power losses, see figure 5, and\naveraged data is given in the appendix, table A3. All calculations of power loss at\nevery test condition are presented in figure 5. It is worth stating that due to the\nminimal influence of load on film thickness under these test conditions, the power\nlosses associated with varying loads, at the same speed condition, was very similar,\nsee figure 5. The increase in AE with power loss was not surprising given that\nincrease in speed results in more power loss due to the increased friction in the\nshearing of the lubricant. A reduced minimum film thickness causes increased power\nlosses and such energy losses are noted by an increase in AE r.m.s levels. A\nrelationship between the power losses and AE r.m.s levels was determined:\nAE (r.m.s in volts) = A.W 3 - B.W 2 + C.W - D (1)\nwhere W = power loss (KW), A = .006, B = 0.005. C = 0.01 and D = 0.01\nThis equation holds based on the assumption that the load has minimal influence on\nthe film thickness which is the case for this investigation.\nFigure 3 AE r.m.s levels for Load conditions (4000 rpm)\nFigure 4 AE r.m.s levels for varying speed and load conditions (40dB amplification)\nFigure 5 AE r.m.s and total power loss for varying speed and load conditions\n3.2 Rubbing Test\nA presumption made for most of the results presented is that under hydrodynamic\nconditions there is no asperity contact between the rotating shaft the bearing. It was\nthought prudent to assess the sensitivity of the AE measurements to the onset of\ncontact between the shaft and the journal. In the rubbing tests the shaft was forced to\nrub against the journal. This was achieved by slowly increasing the load on the\nbearing at the drive end only; the loading of the bearing was changed rapidly at\nincremental values of 50N force to a maximum load of 400N. Initially the test was run\nat 1000 rpm (16.67 Hz) with a 50N load for 5 minutes, after which 50N increments\nwere made within a two minute time frame to the maximum load of 400N at the drive\nend only. Interestingly, at 350N a significant increase in AE levels was noted, see\nfigure 6. In addition, AE waveforms were acquired at each force increment as\ndepicted in figure 6. It was noted that associated with the rise in AE levels the AE\nwaveform was modulated at the rotational shaft speed, see figure 6 and 7. Figure 7\nhighlights a few AE waveforms showing varying degrees of amplitude of the\nmodulated waveform, which is postulated to be a function of the intensity of the rub.\nSuch observations validate the results of others [3, 4] as indicative of a rubbing\ncontact within the journal.\nFigure 6 AE r.m.s levels and associated sample waveform during rub tests\nFigure 7 Modulated AE waveforms due to rubbing between 170 seconds\nand 220 seconds of figure 6\n4. CONCLUSIONS\nThe observations presented have confirmed that in a properly maintained\nhydrodynamic lubrication regime a principal source of AE is the friction in the\nshearing of the lubricant. It has been shown that an increase in running speed\ngenerates higher AE activity in comparison to an increase in bearing load. This is\nattributed to the powers losses as a direct result of shearing of the lubricant film.\nLastly, the application of AE to detection of bearing wipe has been demonstrated and\nfurther research is needed to fully understand the influence of operational variables on\nAE over a much broader operating range, including oil viscosity and bearing material\neffects.\nREFERENCES\n1.
