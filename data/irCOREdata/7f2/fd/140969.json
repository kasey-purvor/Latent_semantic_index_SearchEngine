Introduction \nTrends in aircraft manufacture are towards creation of integral structures via use of carbon \nfibre polymer composite materials and in metals via manufacturing processes such as \nwelding, casting and forging, high-speed machining, rather than the traditional riveting [1-2]. \nThis is mainly driven by manufacture cost saving in future metallic aircraft structures. Integral \nstructures also bring the benefits of reduction in part counts, weight saving and simplification \nin inspection. However, unlike structures fabricated by mechanical fastening techniques, \nintegral structures do not contain redundant structural members that could act as crack \nstoppers or retarders; they hence lack fail safety capability, and regulators penalise such \nstructures by imposing extra design safety factors. In order to improve damage tolerance \ncapabilities it is important to include fail-safe design features for single load path \nconstructions.  \nOne promising solution is to use selective reinforcement [3-6]. In 1990 Schijve [3] reported \nhis work on bonded crack stopper bands using a fibre-metal laminate named as ARALL made \n                                                 \n*\n Corresponding author.

Zhang). \n 2 \nof Aramid fibres and compared the test result with other crack retarders made of two \naluminium alloys, 2024-T3 and 7075-T6, and Ti-6Al-4V. The straps were either riveted or \nbonded to 2024-T3 substrates. Fatigue crack growth tests showed that the best strap materials \nwere the ARALL and the titanium alloy. Recent boost in future aircraft structures has \nencouraged more research in crack growth retarders for integral structures. Extensive \nexperimental work has been carried out in [4], in which different reinforcement materials \n(GLARE, AA7075-T762, and carbon-epoxy in a fibre metal laminate) were investigated in \nfatigue tests of wide aluminium panel with bonded reinforcement straps. These straps were \npre-stretched to reduce or reverse the bonding residual stress in the substrate, and in this way \nthe fatigue crack growth (FCG) life was significantly increased. The thinnest panels had the \nlargest reinforcement volume fraction (28%) and achieved an average life improvement of \nmore than 300%. Aluminium straps on integrally stiffened panels were also tested and the life \nwas improved by 50% but it demonstrates the necessity of using fatigue insensitive strap \nmaterials to eliminate any premature failure of the structure.  \nWork in [5] reports a numerical simulation of wide skin-stringer panels, which were either \nintegrally machined or mechanically fastened, with the former being reinforced by bonded \nstraps. The study deliberately selected two very different materials to make the straps, i.e. a \nductile titanium alloy and a brittle but much stiffer and higher strength unidirectional carbon \ncomposite. Although the straps were much narrower (15 mm) and far fewer than that reported \nin [4], they had significant beneficial effect on both fatigue crack growth life and residual \nstrength. Further modelling work and experimental tests were carried out to study the effect of \ncuring temperature and bonding process [6]. Meanwhile the concept of integrally machined \nlocal pad-ups (or crenellations) on aluminium alloy panels was tested and modelled [7]. \nFatigue crack growth rate was reduced significantly. The same concept was also modelled in \n[8] which focused on the buckling strength performance. In [7] the idea of slanted stringers \nwas proposed to promote crack turning and hence reduce the crack growth rate. In the civil \nengineering field, pre-stressed carbon-epoxy reinforcements were bonded to steel plate in \norder to induce compressive stress in the substrate which promotes crack closure and reduces \nthe FCG rate [9]. Parametric study was carried out by FEA to find the influence of the strap \nthickness and elastic modulus and pre-tension stress level on the crack growth driving force. \nBonding two different materials creates hybrid structures, for which the failure process is \ncomplicated. Failure processes include fatigue crack growth in the substrate, disbond failure \nof adhesive interface, delamination damage within composite material straps, and possible \nstrap failure due to fatigue loads, notch and free-edge effects. There are many design \nparameters, such as the strap material, strap dimension and position, which influence the \nfatigue crack growth rate and structural residual strength. It\u2019s virtually impossible to model \nthe entire fatigue crack growth history of a full scale structure on a cycle-by-cycle basis; there \nare many factors that should be taken into account, such as the crack tip plastic deformation \nand crack closure effect. There is also the load sequence effect arising from spectrum loads. \nOn the other hand, it\u2019s equally unrealistic or very expensive to physically test all design \nconfigurations with all possible failure scenarios at the design stage; hence a numerical tool is \ndesirable to help the design process and simulate the structural integrity performance. The \n 3 \nultimate goal is to reduce the number of large structural tests through small sample tests and \nimproved simulation, and hence, to reduce uncertainties in design allowables.  \nThis paper focuses on crack growth retarders bonded to integral metallic structures typified by \nskin-stringer panels for aircraft wing applications. The main objective is to develop credible \nmodelling techniques based on the theory of linear elastic fracture mechanics.  \n2. Problem statement  \n2.1 Strap reinforced skin-stringer panels  \nPreliminary modelling work was carried out on generic skin-stringer panels representing \ntypical aircraft wing skin covers with either riveted or integrally-machined stringers [5]. The \nskin sheets and stringers were both made of aluminium alloy 2024-T351. Following problems \nwere investigated: (a) fatigue crack growth and residual strength behaviour of these panels \ncontaining a skin crack under a broken central stringer and comparison of the fail-safety \ncapabilities; (b) improving fail-safety of the integrally stiffened panel by attaching narrow and \nthin straps made of a titanium alloy or carbon epoxy composite. The main results are \nsummarised below.   \nFig. 1 shows FE calculated stress intensity factor coefficients (\u03b2) as a function of normalised \nhalf crack length for integrally stiffened and riveted panels together with the theoretical \nsolution of un-stiffened panel of the same width. The initial crack length under the central \nbroken stringer was 50 mm (2ao). Computational details can be found in [5]. For both forms \nof stringer panel, initially the \u03b2 values are much higher than those of an un-stiffened panel due \nto the broken stringer transferring stress back to the skin sheet. The values of \u03b2 decrease when \nskin crack approaches the first outer stringer, and at the stringer to skin joint, the \u03b2 value of \nthe integral panel is significantly lower than that of the riveted panel due to the complete rigid \nconnection of stringer to skin. However, \u03b2 value of the integral panel soon increases rapidly \nafter the crack has passed the first outer stringer because of the crack growth along the \nintegral stringer. Once the crack has grown through the stringer web section, the complete \nfailure of the stringer causes an instant increase in \u03b2. In contrast with the integral panel, \u03b2 of \nthe riveted panel decreases as the skin crack grows due to the intact outer stringers picking up \nmore loads from the cracked skin. Beyond the two-bay crack length, stress in the stringer \nincreases rapidly. In [5], stringer failure due to yielding was not modelled; hence the \ncontinued decrease in \u03b2 for a six-bay crack length. This provides un-conservative prediction \nof crack growth. In fact, \u03b2 will increase after the first outer stringer fails due to yielding. The \nresults in Fig. 1 are consistent with an earlier study [10].  \nBased on the \u03b2 solution, fatigue crack growth life and residual strength for both panels were \ncalculated [5]. Under both constant and variable amplitude loads, the integral panel fails by \nthe fracture criterion at two-bay crack length, whereas the riveted panel has much longer \ncritical crack length (under the design limit load) and much longer crack growth life (almost \ndoubled).  \nTo overcome this problem, adhesively bonded straps were modelled as crack growth retarders \nas illustrated in Fig. 2 [5]. These straps were made of titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V or \ncarbon\/epoxy 6376C-HTA, 15 mm wide and 3 mm thick, and were placed 6 mm away from \n 4 \nthe skin doubler edge. The Ti-alloy is very ductile hence will cope with larger crack opening \ndisplacement while the strap acts like a bridge exerting traction forces to the crack faces; the \ncomposite strap is brittle but has very high tensile strength (almost double the Ti-alloy \nstrength), so it can take much greater loads from the cracked skin and the material is about \n60% lighter. Properties representing adhesive FM73 were used to simulate a bonded layer \nbetween the strap and substrate. The modelling results show that bonded straps cause \nreduction of the stress intensity factors by about 25%. Consequently fatigue crack growth \nrates were reduced even more significantly. Fig. 2 shows the predicted crack growth lives of \nthe integral panels with and without bonded straps.  \n2.2 Scope of this investigation \nThe above example was a preliminary study to explore the crack retarder capability using \nestimated strap dimensions and positions. For practical application the material choice and \ngeometry of these crack retarders should be carefully designed; their impact on the overall \nload transfer, structural stiffness and long-term structural integrity should be studied.  \nRecently more comprehensive research has been carried out by experimental testing and \nnumerical modelling. Test samples included the middle-crack tension, M(T), and single edge \nnotch tension, SENT, specimens. The substrates were made of aluminium alloys 2024-T351 \nand 7085-T7651. Test samples are shown in Fig. 3. The bonded straps were made of three \ndifferent materials, i.e. carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP), glass fibre reinforced \npolymer (GFRP), and titanium alloy Ti-6V-4Al (Ti-6-4). Material properties are given in \nTables 1 and 2. Performance of these straps was evaluated in terms of crack growth rate \nretardation and fatigue life increment. The modelling approach and test results are reported in \nthe following sections. \n3. Modelling Approach \nThe analysis is based on the theory of linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) using the \nfinite element method (FEM). Fig. 4 shows a simple bonded structure where a metallic \nsubstrate is reinforced by a bonded composite material strap. Under cyclic loads, there are \nfour possible failure modes, i.e. initiation and growth of a lead crack in the metallic substrate, \ndisbond failure in the adhesive interface, delamination damage in a strap made of composite \nlaminate, and fatigue cracking in the straps due to free-edge or notch effects. The main \nchallenge is to model the interactions of different failure mechanisms.  \nBonded straps work by two mechanisms. Firstly, when a substrate crack enters and \nsubsequently propagates in a strap covered region, the strap will act like a \u201cstiffener\u201d \nproviding \u201clocal stiffening\u201d that adds load carrying capability by transferring load from \ncracked substrate to strap; hence the crack growth rate will be reduced. Fig. 4a shows this \nscenario. However, this beneficial effect could be affected by the presence of local thermal \nresidual stresses arising from the bonding and curing process. The second mechanism takes \nplace when the crack has passed the strapped region. The strap behind the crack tip will exert \ntraction forces on the crack surfaces reducing the crack opening displacement, and \nsubsequently the effective value of crack growth driving force \u2206K. This is the so-called \n\u201ccrack bridging\u201d effect, see Fig. 4b. The effectiveness of these crack retardation mechanisms \n 5 \ndepends on the strap material properties and geometric parameters. For example, due to the \nstiffness mismatch of the strap and substrate materials and stress concentration at the strap \nfree edges, a progressive disbond could develop in the interface that will reduce both the local \nstiffening effect and the strap bridging traction. All these damage scenarios and crack \nretardation mechanisms have been considered in this study.  \n3.1 Stress intensity factor for bonded structures under static load \nCrack tip stress fields are characterised by the crack tip stress intensity factor (K) calculated \nby the well known expression: \n                             aK pi\u03b2\u03c3=                          (1) \nwhere, \u03c3 is the nominal applied stress, a half crack length, and \u03b2 the stress intensity factor \ncoefficient (SIFC) which is a function of the sample\u2019s geometry. For a uniform stress field, K \nmay be normalised by the factor Ko ( aK o pi\u03c3= ) leading to the non-dimensional term \u03b2. \nEquation (1) is valid only for homogeneous and isotropic materials.  \nIn this study, straps are modelled as stiffeners attached by continuous bonding to the \nsubstrate. The stress intensity factor is determined via the calculation of the strain energy \nrelease rate (G). For the case of room temperature cure, i.e. without thermal residual stresses, \nand for fixed strap dimensions, G due to the external stress is Gappl:  \n   ),,,,( 21 llafGappl \u03b2\u03c3=      (2) \nwhere, \u03c3 is the nominal applied stress,  a half length of the lead crack in substrate, and l1 and \nl2 are areas of disbond and delamination.  \nFor a given crack length, Gappl is calculated by the FEM using the modified virtual crack \nclosure technique (VCCT) [11-12] and taking into account any delamination and disbond \ndamage at a given applied stress and adhesive toughness. The corresponding Kappl for the \nbonded structure is then determined by the following equation [13]:  \n   EGK\napplappl =   (plane stress)   (3a) \n   \n21 \u03bd\u2212\n=\nEG\nK appl\nappl   (plane strain)   (3b) \nwhere E is the elastic modulus and \u03c5 the Poisson\u2019s ratio.  \nThe calculated Kappl is normalised by Ko to obtain \u03b2:  \no\nappl\nK\nK\n=\u03b2        (4) \nKo is the SIF for the crack in the absence of the strap in an infinitely large sheet. Therefore \u03b2 \nis an indicator of the change in SIF produced by the additional stiffness of the strap. However, \nsince disbond\/delamination is considered in calculating the K values, \u03b2 is also     indirectly \n 6 \nrelated to the applied stress because the disbond and delamination damages are functions of \nthe nominal stress.  \nThe action of thermal residual stresses arising from the elevated cure temperature will result \nin an additional component of stress intensity Kres, therefore the actual SIF Kact under static \nloading is the sum of that applied via remote loading and that contributed from the residual \nstress field. \n   \nresapplact KKK +=      (5) \nFor simple geometry and loading forms, Kappl and Kres may be calculated separately by \nexisting solutions, e.g. handbooks, FEM, or the Green\u2019s or weight functions.   \nIn this study, Kact is calculated by the FEM by inputting the applied stress and the residual \nstress field into the FE models simultaneously. The crack tip strain energy release rate (Gact) \ndue to crack extension is:  \n       ),,,,,( 21 llafG resact \u03b2\u03c3\u03c3=     (6) \nand then Kact can be found by equation (3) by changing the subscript \u201cappl\u201d to \u201cact\u201d for both \nthe G and K variables. Our modelling work (described in the appendix) has shown that Kact \nvalue calculated by eqs. (6) and (3) equals to that obtained by the superposition method by eq. \n(5).    \nIn order to make comparisons of strap reinforced substrates with and without the cure \ntemperature effect, it is convenient to consider the additional stress intensity Kres as part of the \n\u03b2 correction factor, which is therefore increased from that value arising from pure geometrical \nfactors.  \n   \no\nact\neq K\nK\n=\u03b2       (7) \nUnder static loads, \u03b2eq is a good indicator of the stress intensity at a given applied stress due \nto the contribution of additional straps and thermal residual stresses; although \u03b2eq is not a pure \ngeometrical factor, it has a unique value for a given geometry, applied stress, strap material \nand thermal residual stress field. Based on this \u03b2eq factor, the residual strength of a bonded \nstructure can be calculated through the relation of \u03b2eq vs. a. For example, for a given design \nlimit stress \u03c3max, the critical crack length acrit can be found by: \n    \n2\nmax\n)(1\neq\nIC\ncrit\nK\na \u03b2\u03c3pi=      (8) \nwhere KIC is the material\u2019s fracture toughness using a wide panel test.  \nIn this study the thermal residual stress field was calculated by the FEM. The applied thermal \nload \u2206T is derived based on the theory that it is the drop in temperature, from stress free \ncondition at temperature To to ambient temperature Ta, that causes the thermal residual \nstresses in the adherends. While the manufacturer will specify the cure temperature Tc, the \nstress free temperature is not usually given as the material property data; generally, To is \nlower than Tc [14]. In this study we have assumed To = Tc, i.e. the two adherends become a \nbonded piece at the cure temperature. Since the experimental test was conducted at the \n 7 \nambient temperature Ta, the temperature drop was \u2206T = Ta - To. Note that this is a negative \nvalue. \n3.2 FE modelling of disbond damage  \nFinite element analysis was performed for different lead crack lengths to find the Kact vs. a \n(and \u03b2eq vs. a) relation under a given applied stress. The commercial code MSC NASTRAN \nwas employed for this calculation. The substrate and straps were modelled by 2D plate\/shell \nelements and the adhesive layer was modelled by the interface elements; each consisting of \ntwo rigid elements and three spring elements as shown in Fig. 5. The rigid elements are used \nto model the adhesive thickness and the spring elements to model the mechanical properties \nand failure behaviour of the adhesive layer: one for the peel action and two for the shear in the \nX-Z and Y-Z planes. This adhesive model was first developed by Tahmasebi [15] to model \nbonded joints by strength-based analysis. It is adapted in this work for its simplicity of \ncalculating the strain energy release rate and modelling the disbond growth.  \nIn the experimental tests both adhesive disbond and delamination in the composite straps \nwere observed. Disbond failure was, however, more significant than delamination for the \nthree strap materials investigated, thus only the adhesive disbond was modelled by using the \ninterface elements. In principle, delamination can be modelled by the aforementioned method \nby placing the interface elements in the delamination region. A better method could be to use \na degradation law to reduce the stiffness of delaminated straps.  \nA set of MATLAB subroutines have been coded to model the disbond growth; these \nsubroutines perform post-processing analyses of the NASTRAN delivered FE results by \nacquiring the values of the spring axial forces and crack tip opening displacements for both \nthe main crack and disbond front and then calculating the strain energy release rate by the \nmodified VCCT method [11-12]. In order to compute the strain energy release rate on the \ndisbond front, initial disbond damage along the strap edge was assumed, which was the local \nmesh size of 1 mm and can be regarded as adhesive defect. In that way the strain energy \nrelease rate can be computed and the damage extended when following criterion is satisfied:    \n    1)()( \u2265+ n\nIIC\nIIm\nIC\nI\nG\nG\nG\nG\n    (9) \nwhere GI and GII are the strain energy release rates in mode I and mode II load conditions, \nrespectively, GIC and GIIC the corresponding critical values (fracture toughness), and m and n \nare material constants, and in this study we have assumed m = n = 1. If eq. (9) is satisfied for a \nset of spring elements, then these springs are removed from the FE model to mimic the \ndisbond damage propagation. \nOnce a new disbond front is determined for the given load and substrate crack length, another \nFE analysis is performed to calculate the stress intensity factor according to eqs. (2) and (3). \nTherefore, disbond development is counted as a correction factor for the SIF solution of the \nlead crack in substrate. Calculation procedures are given in [17].  \n3.3 Damage growth under fatigue loading \n 8 \nFatigue crack growth life was determined by integrating the Paris law [18] using measured \ncrack growth data for the substrate material under the same stress ratio: \nn\nactKCdN\nda )(\u2206=\n    (10) \nwhere, \u2206\u039aact is the stress intensity factor range under cyclic loads, N the number of cycles, \nand C and n are material constants. \u2206\u039aact is obtained by: \n    aK eqact pi\u03c3\u03b2 \u2206=\u2206     (11a) \nand     R = \u03c3min \/\u03c3max     (11b) \nThe difference in the \u2206\u039aact and R values obtained by above equation from those calculated by \nthe superposition method [e.g. 19] is explained in the Appendix.   \nFor the growth of a disbond between strap and substrate or delamination within a laminate \nstrap under cyclic loads, following equation should be used:  \n    )( Gf\ndN\ndl \u2206=      (12) \nwhere \u2206G is the range of strain energy release rate under cyclic loads, l the delamination or \ndisbond size. Ideally fatigue delamination growth should be treated as a separate crack front \nand the growth rate be regarded as independent from that of the lead crack in substrate. An \nanalysis tool should ideally calculate the da\/dN and dl\/dN simultaneously. However, for \nreasons given below we did not choose eq. 12 to predict fatigue delamination growth. Firstly, \nthere are few measured data of this relation for composite materials or adhesive bonds. \nDelamination damage patterns and growth rates change with different layups and local \nsupport conditions. Secondly, for this application (Fig. 4) the stress intensity of the lead crack \nin the substrate is dominating whereas failure of bonded straps is secondary due to its failure \nmode. The latter is mostly mode II (in-plane shear) coupled with mode I due to secondary \nbending caused by one-sided bonding. Therefore the influence of a strap delamination on the \nSIF of lead crack is relatively small compared to the large and beneficial bridging forces \noffered by these straps.  \nInstead of using eq. (12) it was decided to use disbond or delamination damage area as a \ngeometrical factor to further correct the lead crack Kact as given in eq. (2) or (6). The corrected \nKact represents crack growth driving force with disbond effect, and under cyclic loads \u2206Kact is \nthen used in the Paris law (eq. 10) to calculated crack growth rates and via integration the a \nvs. N curve of the reinforced substrate.  \nFor structures under cyclic tension-compression or cyclic compression-compression loads, \ndisbond damage will be subjected to mode I (crack opening) loads and the growth rate of \ndelamination\/disbond could be the same magnitude to that of lead substrate crack. In this \ncase, calculations based on eq. 12 and independent of the lead crack growth rate may be \nnecessary. Further research is needed to obtain the material level damage growth rate and \ncalibrate eq. (12) for structural level calculations.    \n4. Development of properties to input into the model \n 9 \n4.1 Material properties \u2013 coupon test data \nBasic coupon test data are required to link the structural fracture driving forces (K, GI & GII) \nwith the material damage growth and toughness properties. Relevant material data used in this \nstudy are: substrate fatigue crack growth rates (Paris constants C and n for the given R ratio) \nand fracture toughness (KIC) of the substrate material, modes I and II toughness in terms of \ncritical strain energy release rates of delamination growth within a composite strap (GIC & \nGIIC), toughness of the adhesive bond (GIC & GIIC). Data used in this study and the data \nsources are given in Tables 1 and 2 for the substrate and strap materials, respectively.    \n4.2 Residual stress developed during strap bond cure  \nThe high strength and toughness adhesives used to bond the straps require an elevated \ntemperature cure (typically 70 \u2013 120oC), resulting in tensile residual stresses in the substrate. \nTo estimate their magnitude, residual stress distributions for the fatigue test sample geometry \nshown in Fig. 3(b) were modelled using 2D plate finite elements. The plates were made of \n7085 aluminium, 10 mm thick, 140 mm wide with straps of unidirectional CFRP, GFRP, and \ntitanium alloy Ti-6-4, bonded to the surface at the locations shown. The straps were 200 mm \nlong, 20 mm wide and 2 mm thick. The samples were cured at 120oC. The residual stresses \ndeveloped will be a function of the difference in the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) \nbetween substrate and strap, the stiffness of the two materials, and the curing temperature.  \nProfiles of calculated longitudinal residual stress (\u03c3yy) of the sample half way along the length \nfor the three strap materials are shown in Fig. 6 (Fig. 6a for a sample of the same dimension \nof the SENT but without the notch and 6b for SENT sample with 17 mm long initial notch as \nshown in Fig. 3b). These are the stress values in the middle of the thickness calculated by the \n2D plate elements. For the un-notched sample (Fig. 6a), two effects can be seen. Firstly, as \nthe strap is bonded with the centreline of the strap 23 mm from the centre line of the substrate, \nthere is an in plane bending stress developed in the substrate. Secondly, there is a local \nenhancement of stress under the strap, present in the titanium and the GFRF, but not \nnoticeably in the CFRP. For the notched samples (ao = 17 mm, Fig. 3b), the notch tip stresses \nare much higher than those under the strap due to stress concentration effect. It should be \nnoted that the sum of the residual stresses is not zero. This is the main difference between a \nwelding process and adhesive curing process. For welding the sum of the residual stresses \nmust be zero since no external force is applied and the structure must be in self equilibrium. \nIn this case, residual stress is exerted by the strap on to the substrate; hence for the substrate it \nis like an external force. Obviously, if the whole bonded structure is considered, the sum of \nresidual stresses will be zero, i.e. compression in the strap and tension in the substrate.  \nThe effect of residual stress on the stress intensity factor at particular crack lengths cannot be \ninterpreted from the immediate local residual stress at the crack tip, but is a consequence of \nthe integrated effect of the entire distribution on Kres, the component of stress intensity \nresulting from the action of the residual stress. The actual stress intensity factor Kact under \nstatic loading is therefore the sum of that applied via remote loading and that contributed from \nthe residual stress field as given by eq. (5). During fatigue testing crack lengths were \nmeasured experimentally by the electrical potential technique, which measures a crack length \naveraged through the sample thickness, corresponding to the length again at mid thickness. \n 10 \nThus the measured crack lengths and calculated residual stress fields are both relevant to the \nmid thickness of the sample.  \nFigure 7 shows for the titanium strap, the \u03b2 correction factors due purely to sample and crack \ngeometry, the factor caused by geometry plus the additional strap stiffness, and the factor \nresulting from the geometry, strap stiffness and residual stresses. It can be seen that in the \nabsence of residual stress, the stiffness of the strap causes the \u03b2 factors to reduce at all crack \nlengths; addition of thermal residual stress causes the \u03b2 to increase for all crack lengths, and \nin the region where the crack tip is approaching the edge of the strap and tunnelling under it, \nthe \u03b2 is greater than the value without the strap present. This implies that cracks will \naccelerate in this region, rather than be retarded.  \nA comparison of the combined \u03b2 factor vs. crack length for all three strap materials is shown \nin Fig. 8. Both the GFRP and CFRP straps follow the same trends as the titanium strap shown \nin Fig. 7.  The region where the crack tip is approaching the strap has \u03b2 values greater than the \nsample without the strap; as the crack grows through the strap, \u03b2 reduces, reaching a \nminimum as it emerges from the strap and it steadily increases as the crack progresses further \nbut always with a value less than the un-strapped sample. The largest \u03b2 is that of the CFRP \nstrap.  \n5. Fatigue crack growth tests \n5.1 Test samples and test procedure \nTwo fatigue crack growth test configurations were used. One sample (shown in Fig. 3(a)) was \nof M(T) geometry, made of 1.6 mm thick 2024-T351. It was reinforced by straps made of \nunidirectional M21-T800 CFRP. They were 200 mm long and 25 mm wide, bonded either \nside of the centre notch with the strap edge 45 mm from the centreline. The M(T) samples \nwere bonded using REDUX 810 and were cured at either room temperature (RT) or 70oC. \nThe second sample was SENT geometry made of 10 mm thick 7085-T7651 alloy, rigidly \nclamped at the ends, with the dimensions shown in Fig. 3(b). It should be noted that this is not \nthe ASTM standard SE(T) sample geometry. The strap was 20 mm wide and 200 mm long, \nand the strap edge was 37 mm from the sample edge. In this test sample the strap materials \nwere unidirectional CFRP Cycom 919HF-42%-HS, unidirectional Hexcel 913 GFRP and Ti-\n6Al-4V titanium alloy. Stiffness and strength properties of the strap materials are given in \nTable 2. Straps were bonded to the substrate using procedures described in detail in [16], \nusing FM 94 adhesive and were cured at 120oC. \nAfter bonding, the samples were cyclically loaded in digitally controlled fatigue test machines \nof capacity 100 and 250 kN, at an R ratio of 0.1 and a frequency of 10 Hz. Crack lengths were \nmonitored as a function of fatigue cycles using both electrical potential techniques and optical \nmeasurement with a travelling microscope. The nominal stress applied to the samples was 70 \nMPa for the 1.6 mm M(T) samples and 18.57 MPa  for the 10 mm SENT.  \n5.2 Fatigue crack growth results \n(a) M(T) samples \n 11 \nFigure 9 shows a plot of crack length vs. fatigue cycles for two thicknesses of strap: a single \nply (0.25mm thick) and a double ply (0.5 mm), and for the cures at 70oC and room \ntemperature. Also shown is the crack growth curve for a panel without a strap. For the room \ntemperature cure without thermal residual stress there is significant crack retardation and \nincreased fatigue life, with 0.25 and 0.5 mm thick straps extending the life by factors of 2 and \n3 respectively. In contrast the panel cured at 70oC with residual stresses present showed a \ndecrease in life for the 0.25 mm strap and a slight increase for the 0.5 mm strap. It can be \nconcluded that the residual stresses are responsible for a reduction in life by a factor of 3 \ncompared with the lives obtained without them in the room temperature cure. Both with and \nwithout residual stress, longer lives were obtained with the thicker straps, which are of course \nstiffer and offer greater resistance to crack opening. The trade-off between the strap stiffness \nand cure temperature induced tensile residual stress needs further parametric study.  \n(b) SENT samples \nAll the 10 mm thick SENT samples were cured at 120oC. Figure 10 shows the measured crack \nlength vs. cycles data for these samples for three different strap materials. Also shown is the \ncrack growth curve for the 7085 aluminium without a strap.  Figure 10 shows that in terms of \ntotal life, the un-strapped material is the worst and Ti-6-4, the best. Of the composite straps, \nCFRP is only marginally better than the un-strapped material, and GFRP is significantly \nbetter.  It was observed experimentally that as the crack tip progressed under the strap, an \nadhesive disbond developed separating the strap from the substrate. This has the effect of \ndecreasing the effective stiffness of the strap, and allowing the effective \u2206K (expressed as the \n\u03b2 value) of the crack tip to increase slowly back to the original un-strapped values.  \n6. Comparison of experimental and predicted fatigue crack growth behaviour \n6.1 M(T) sample \nThe disbond between the CFRP strap and the substrate revealed after complete sample failure \nis shown in Fig. 11(a). The disbond length modelled using FE is also illustrated in the figure \nand the calculated disbond length shows good agreement with that found in experiments. \nCalculated \u03b2 values (Fig. 11b) show significant differences depending on whether a disbond \nwas allowed to develop at a rate depending on the assumed toughness of the polymer matrix, \nor whether the strap remained intact as the fatigue crack length increased (assuming infinite \nfracture toughness).  \nFatigue crack growth life was then calculated by integrating the Paris law, eq. (10). A \ncomparison of predicted and measured crack length versus fatigue cycles is shown in Fig. 11c \nfor the case of a CFRP strap with a room temperature cure (without thermal residual stress), \nand allowing a disbond to develop; there is generally good agreement of the model with the \ntest data, although the model predicts considerably faster crack growth rate than those found \nexperimentally for the region where the crack tip is under the strap. This seems to contradict \nwith the calculated \u03b2 trend in Fig. 11b, where \u03b2 is permanently decreased when crack tip is in \nthe strap region. This may be explained by calculating the second derivative of the \u201ca \u2013 N\u201d \ncurve as function of crack length a by using the Paris law. It can be seen from Fig. 11b that \nd\u03b2 \/da < 0 when crack tip is in the strap region, therefore the second derivative of the \u201ca \u2013 N\u201d \n 12 \ncurve (d2a\/dN2) in this region is negative. This means that the \u201ca \u2013 N\u201d curve (Fig. 11c) is \nconvex instead of the concave shape found experimentally. Since such crack growth \nacceleration was not observed by the test, it could be either that the real \u03b2 function does not \ndecrease in the same way as it was computed or that the material da\/dN data should not be \napproximated by a straight line as described by the Paris law, which we currently use. Our \ntests have shown that for the aluminium alloy the da\/dN data is not a straight line [20] and \nwhen we use the measured da\/dN curve we do not predict the local enhanced convex curve; \nthis matter is currently under investigation.  \n6.2 SENT samples \nThe predicted fatigue crack length vs. cycles behaviour and the test result for the CFRP strap \ncase are presented in Fig. 12a. As in the case of the M(T) samples, in the region under the \nstrap predicted crack lengths are greater than experimental ones, while with the crack tip \nbeyond the strap crack lengths are under predicted. When using CFRP straps by elevated \ntemperature cure, there is little overall retardation (17%) developed.   \nThe Ti-6Al-4V straps have significant ductility (>10%) compared with both CFRP (1-2% \nductility) and GFRP (2-4%), and will be subject to local yielding at the site of the advancing \nsubstrate crack. The FE simulation in [5] shows that the straps are subject to considerable \nplastic deformation when the crack has passed the straps. Compared to high strength but \nbrittle carbon composite, ductile Ti alloy picks up loads gradually from the cracked substrate, \ni.e. yielding will limit the elastic stress in the strap. Therefore the stress transfer in adhesive \nbond should be lower than that in a brittle carbon strap resulting in smaller disbond area and \nhence lower \u03b2 values. In our FE models, the effect of plastic deformation in the Ti alloy strap \nwas modelled by computing the von Mises equivalent stress and comparing it with the \nmaterial yield strength (uniaxial test data). Numerical iterations are performed based on the \nnon-linear material stress-strain curve until the true elasto-plastic stress values in the Ti-strap \nare found.  \nFigure 12b shows that the predicted FCG life for the Ti-alloy strap is in good agreement with \nthe test result, although as for the case of the CFRP strap, the predicted fatigue crack lengths \nunder the strap region are significantly greater than those found experimentally and are \npredicted to be greater than the un-strapped sample. Once the crack tip was outside the strap \nzone, crack growth retardation became significant, as was predicted by the model. Overall \nFCG life is increased by almost 65% for this strap material.  \nThe life improvement achieved by the unidirectional CFRP was not as good as that achieved \nby the Ti-alloy strap due to two factors. Firstly, the biggest mismatch in the stiffness and CTE \nbetween the CFRP strap and substrate materials results in higher tensile residual stress as \nshown in Fig. 6 and discussions in Section 4.2. Consequently the crack growth driving force \n(Fig. 8) and crack growth rates were increased in the early stage of the crack growth life. A \nsmall crack growth acceleration was found experimentally in the strap covered region (Fig. \n12a), and a much larger one is predicted. \n 13 \nThe crack growth retardation subsequent to the strap region was significantly smaller for the \nCFRP than for the Ti alloy strap. FE modelling of local stresses and failure progression in \nCFRP shows that that this is caused by the bigger mismatch in the CTE between the CFRP \nstrap and substrate materials resulting in higher crack growth driving force (Fig. 8). The \nstiffness mismatch between the substrate and CFRP strap also contributes to this effect [17]. \nBoth mismatch effects promote large shear stresses in the bond and lead in turn to \ndelamination damage within the CFRP strap and also in the adhesive bond. Since the matrix \nmaterial in the composite is not as tough as the adhesive (Table 2), there is more delamination \nwithin the laminate. Damaged straps cannot effectively transfer stresses from cracked \nsubstrate to the straps and hence there will be in less traction force for crack bridging. On the \nother hand, the titanium straps have a smaller stiffness mismatch, but also will have no \ntendency to create a delamination within the titanium strap. Instead the delamination will \noccur within the adhesive bond; a location with a much higher mode II toughness and \nresistance to delamination growth. The value for the mode II toughness of the adhesive used \n(FM94) has been measured at Cranfield [21] using a modified 3 point End Notched Flexure \ntest in the course of this work to be in excess of 9,000 J\/m2, which is much tougher than that \nof the matrix material in the CFRP laminate.      \nModelling studies have shown that the stiffer the strap, the greater the bridging effect [17]. \nHowever, a high stiffness strap will also encourage more stress transfer from the substrate to \nthe strap; this could promote disbond failure. Therefore, a trade-off between the adhesive \nstrength and strap stiffness should be sought. In the configurations examined in [17] plates \nreinforced by unidirectional CFRP straps were predicted to fail due to early disbond as the \nassumed adhesive toughness was too low (it was REDUX 810); a thicker cross-ply strap (with \nmuch lower stiffness) could obtain the same FCG life and avoid early strap disbond. Factors \nthat promote disbond failure were examined in [17] and it was found that this is mainly due to \nthe mismatching of stiffness between substrate and strap and, secondly, the strong anisotropy \nof the unidirectional laminates. If the adhesive is tough enough to be able to take very high \nshear stress, unidirectional carbon-epoxy would be the best material. If disbond is the critical \nfailure mode, then cross-ply, [0, 90]ns, carbon composite is the best choice. Angle-ply carbon-\nepoxy composites do not make good straps. \nFor the glass-epoxy composite strap case, the predicted crack growth life and comparison \nwith the test result is presented in Fig. 12c. The life improvement is not as good as that \nachieved by the Ti alloy strap but significantly better than the carbon strap. The test shows a \nlife improvement of about 36% compared with the un-strapped material. In this case crack \ngrowth acceleration due to curing temperature effect was well predicted. Crack growth \nretardation due to bridging was over estimated. \nIn summary, the ductile Ti-6-4 alloy strap is the best of the three strap materials in terms of \nFCG life improvement. CFRP strap reinforcement could provide effective crack growth \nretardation if cured at the room temperature. However, galvanic corrosion is a concern for \nlong-term durability when bonding carbon-epoxy composites to aluminium structures. \nAnother design criterion is the notch strain to failure limit. Since there are holes in the \naluminium structure as well as in the reinforcement straps, the realistic maximum strain of a \n 14 \nmetallic wing box at ultimate load is about 2.0 - 2.5%.  The maximum notch strain to failure \nof carbon fibre composites is around 0.8 - 1.0%. Hence if we use a strap that has a blunt notch \nstrain to failure much below that of the metallic structure, we could either risk the failing of \nstrap before reaching the structure\u2019s ultimate load or have to limit the maximum design strain \nallowable for the metallic structure resulting in very conservative design. GFRP strap could \nbe a good compromise option in view of the above points.  \n \n7. Conclusions \nOverall, bonded straps are effective in retarding fatigue crack growth rates. The retardation \neffect is present from the beginning, but becomes much more significant when straps are \nbehind the advancing crack tip, the so-called bridging effect. \nIn samples containing tensile residual stress produced by elevated temperature cure, the \nbeneficial stiffening effect of bonded straps is adversely affected. Consequently in the \nstrapped region crack growth retardation can be much reduced or even cancelled by \ntemporary crack growth acceleration. The bridging effect overtakes the thermal residual stress \nas soon as the crack tip grows beyond the strap.  \nHigh strength Ti-6Al-4V alloy straps are the most effective crack retarders but it adds more \nstructural weight. Unidirectional carbon epoxy strap cured at elevated temperature provides \nthe least effective crack growth retardation. The galvanic corrosion and low notch strain to \nfailure limit could also be concerns in design applications. Straps made of glass epoxy \ncomposite could be a good choice in terms of both crack growth retardation and structural \nweight.  \n \nAcknowledgements \nThe authors are grateful to Airbus UK, Alcoa Inc. and the Engineering and Physical Sciences \nResearch Council (through the Cranfield IMRC funding) for providing financial support.  \n \nAppendix A \nA.1. Two methods for calculating \u2206K in the presence of residual stress field \nThe classic method was proposed by Parker [19] based on the superposition principle of LEFM. \nThe effective SIF is calculated by superposing the respective SIF\u2019s for the applied stress and \ninitial residual stress field (eq. A1) and under cyclic load the SIF range and \u201ceffective\u201d R-ratio \nare given in eqs. A2, A3:  \nUnder static load:  \nresappeffl KKK +=       (A1) \nUnder cyclic load:  ])[()( minmax\nappresappresappeff KKKKKK \u2206=+\u2212+=\u2206   (A2) \n)]()[\/()(\nmaxmin\nmaxmin\nratiostress\nresappresappeff KKKKR \u22c5\u2260++= \u03c3\u03c3  (A3) \nTherefore under the cyclic loads, only the \u201ceffective\u201d stress ration Reff changes due to \u03c3res, \nGlinka [22]. However, this Reff ratio is not the same as the original stress ratio R. Question arises \n 15 \non how to use the measured da\/dN\u2013\u2206K data that is based on the cyclic stress R ratio to calculate \ncrack growth rates.   \nThe method used in this study is based on the superposition of the two stress fields, i.e. \nexternally applied and residual stresses are simultaneously inputted into the FE model. The \nstrain energy release rate G and Kact are then calculated by eqs. 6 and 3. This method is \nconvenient for using the FEM to do just one calculation for each crack length to find Kact; \nmoreover, the FEA can model residual stress relaxation when crack extends. \nUnder static stress \u03c3o:  ),,( \u03c5EGfK actact =      (A4) \nNormalising by aK\noo\npi\u03c3= , find: \n   \na\nK\no\nact\neq\npi\u03c3\n\u03b2 =      (A5) \nUnder cyclic stress \u2206\u03c3o:  \n   aK\neq pi\u03c3\u03b2 maxmax =  ,  aK eq pi\u03c3\u03b2 minmin =   (A6) \n   aK\neqact pi\u03c3\u03b2 \u2206\u22c5=\u2206   ][ appK\u2206\u2260    (A7) \n   )]([\/\nmaxmin ratiostressRRact \u22c5== \u03c3\u03c3    (A8) \n \nOur FE modelling has shown that under static load, the two superposition methods deliver the \nsame value of K, i.e. Kact = Keff, therefore taking eq. A1 into eq. A5 we get:    \n   \na\nK\na\nKK\na\nK\no\nres\no\nresapp\no\nact\neq\npi\u03c3\n\u03b2\npi\u03c3pi\u03c3\n\u03b2 +=+==   (A9) \n\u03b2eq depends on the pure geometric factor \u03b2, and also on Kres and \u03c3o. Under the static load, \u03b2eq is a \ngood indicator of non-dimensional Kact that is independent of applied stress \u03c3o; convenient for \nmaking comparisons among different design geometries, and for calculating the residual strength \nat a given applied stress or a given critical crack length.  \nUnder cyclic loads, eq. A6 has \u201cenlarged\u201d the effect of Kres on \u2206Kact by scaling up Kmax and Kmin \nby factor \u03b2eq (not \u03b2); \u03b2eq contains the effect of Kres and external applied stress \u03c3o. However, the \nR ratio remains the same as the original applied stress ratio, i.e. R < Reff.  \nA.2. Comparison of the two methods  \nTo compare the two methods in predicting fatigue crack growth rate, constant amplitude load \ncase is used and the static stress (\u03c3o) in eq. A4 is now replaced by the maximum stress (\u03c3max) in \nour calculation reported below and in the paper. Taking eq. A9 into eq. A7, we have: \n)1( RKKK\nresappact \u2212+\u2206=\u2206     (A10)  \nand eq. A8 is:   \nmaxmin \/\u03c3\u03c3=R      (A11)  \nThe difference between the classic superposition method (eqs. A2, A3) and our method (A10, \nA11) is that  \n     \u2206Kact > \u2206Keff,  Ract = R (< Reff)   (A12) \n 16 \nExamining Eq. (A10), the following can be stated. Firstly, although the \u2206Kact is increased by \nfactor Kres(1-R), which will predict higher crack growth rate than the classic method, R ratio \nremain unchanged and lower than Reff, which will compensate by predicting lower growth rate. \nSecondly, when R is large (say R > 0.6) and Kres is low, then the difference between \u2206Kact and \n\u2206Keff is small to make the predicted crack growth rates close.  \n \nReferences \n1.
