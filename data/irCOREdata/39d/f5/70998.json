Using the case study of transnational law firms and data \ngathered through interviews with partners in London and New York the paper makes \ntwo arguments. First, it shows how relational approaches can help disaggregate \nexisting descriptions of national institutional systems and reveal the importance of \nstudying their constitutive practices. Understanding these micro-level variations, \nsomething missed by macro-level categories like Anglo-American, is shown to be \nessential to better understand if national business systems are or are not changing. \nSecondly, the paper suggests that the relational approach\u2019s focus upon actor-\nnetworks can be used to provide more insight into how the agency of managers and \nworkers informs the management of institutional heterogeneity by TNCs. The \npeculiarities of professional service management and the influence of the home-\ncountry are shown to determine the response of globalizing law firms when home- \nand host-country business practices diverge.   \n \nKey words: Relational economic geography; globalization; law firms; professions; \nnational business systems; varieties of capitalism \n \n \n 3\nManaging the transnational law firm: professional systems, \nembedded actors and time-space sensitive governance \n \n1) Introduction \nTheoretical discussions of transnational corporations (TNCs) associated with \nboth the relational turn (Bathelt and Gl\u00fcckler, 2005; Boggs and Rantisi, 2003) and the \nreinvigoration of the network concept (Amin and Thrift, 1992; Grabher, 2006; Dicken \net al., 2001) in economic geography. The relational network-forms that underlie \neconomic activities are not described as static architectures but as ongoing socio-\neconomic accomplishments constructed through the negotiation of, amongst other \nthings, complex and dynamic institutional backdrops (Ettlinger, 2003; Murphy, 2003; \nYeung, 2005). Consequently, as Dicken et al., (2001, 91) argue, \u201cThis relational \nmethodology\u2026does not automatically assume individuals, firms or nation states as \n\u2018black boxes\u2019. Rather\u2026to understand networks and their embedded relations \nrequires us to probe into the socio-spatial constitution of these individuals, firms and \ninstitutions\u201d.      \nPerhaps one of the most insightful yet understudied case studies is the ever \ngrowing cohort of transnational law firms that now exist. As Beaverstock et al., (1999) \nnote, these firms aim to provide services to TNC clients when cross-border business \ndeals (e.g. mergers, financial restructurings) require globally aligned strategies that \nare also locally acceptable in each jurisdiction. This entails the development of local-\nglobal capabilities with local embeddedness in national regulatory environments yet \nglobally integrated service delivery. It is perhaps surprising, then, that beyond a few \nimportant initial forays into the industry (Beaverstock, 2004; Faulconbridge, 2007; \nFaulconbridge and Muzio, 2007; Jones, 2002, 2007; Warf, 2001) geographers have \nnot studied the networks of these firms in more detail. . In particular, insights into the \nway globalizing professional service firms are embedded by time-space contingent, \n 4\nnational professional institutional systems can be gained from such studies. . In \nparticular, insights into the way globalizing professional service firms are embedded \nby time-space contingent, national professional institutional systems can be gained \nfrom such studies. This is significant because recent years have seen a continuation \nof debates about the complexities of processes of change, convergence and \npersistence in national business systems as TNCs act as vectors of Anglo-American \ncapitalist practices (Clark and W\u03ccjcik, 2005). In the case of law firms there has been \na debate about whether the \u2018Americanization\u2019 of legal practice can be expected as a \nresult of the worldwide influence of transnational firms (Economist, 1996; Morgan, \n2006). Of course, as Gertler (2001; 2004) has so convincingly shown, the influence \nof these law firms is unlikely to be a linear process of worldwide convergence leading \nto all law firms replicating Anglo-American practices. Instead any change is likely to \nbe partial, spatially variegated and influenced by a range of variables including the \nhome-country of the firm and the agency of managers. For Morgan (2005, 3) better \nunderstanding is, therefore, needed of \u201chow differently organized owners, managers, \nand employees construct and change different kinds of organizational capabilities \nand strategies in contrasting institutional environments\u201d. \nDespite a few notable examples (e.g. Bathelt and Gertler, 2006; Yeung, \n2001), particularly in work on the globalization of retail TNCs (Coe and Sook-Lee, \n2006; Wrigley et al., 2005), the analytical tools of relational economic geography \nhave not, however, been fully used to address in a head-on fashion these debates \nabout the dynamics of the varieties of capitalism. I make two arguments in this \nregard. First, I highlight the ability of the relational approach to focus upon the micro-\nscale subtleties of national institutional systems. This enables a more intricate, fine-\ngrained and insightful analysis of the way practice-level variations in institutional \nnorms and behaviours constrain the activities of TNCs. This also allows us to capture \nforms of practice-level change that are driven by the activities of TNCs but are often \nmissed in more abstract descriptions of national systems where coherent units (e.g. \n 5\nAnglo-American; coordinated or liberal market) are the focus of analysis (Crouch, \n2005). Secondly, I show how using the tools of relational economic geography helps \nus understand the effects of the agency of workers and managers who plot in \nindustry- and firm-specific ways to resist or promote the rollout or adaptation of \nhome-country practices is a vital in order to explain change processes.  \nThe rest of the paper develops these arguments over four further sections. \nThe next section locates these issues in the context of existing debates in economic \ngeography and further highlights the strength of relational analyses for developing \nunderstanding of the way institutional heterogeneity is managed by TNCs. Sections \nthree and four present empirical material that examines the way transnational law \nfirms manage across heterogeneous contexts and the variations in approach that \nexist across space, time and between firms. Section five offers some conclusions.  \n \n2) Embedded actor-networks  \n   One of the tenets of the relational framework is an approach that identifies \n\u201cactors in networks, their ongoing relations and the structural outcomes of these \nrelations\u201d (Dicken et al., 2001, 91). This provides detailed consideration of how \n\u201ceconomic agents are situated in particular contexts of social relations and operate \nunder specific institutional and cultural conditions\u201d (Bathelt, 2006, 226). This \ninseparability of the economic and the socio-cultural has long been debated, often \ndrawing on the concept of embeddedness (Granovetter, 1985; Peck, 2005; Polanyi, \n1944) as most recently demonstrated by Hess\u2019 (2004) three-pronged analysis of the \nembeddedness of TNCs. At one level this means unpicking the national and \ninternational regulatory actors shaping the globalization strategies of firms (Hess and \nCoe, 2006; Liu and Dicken, 2006). At another level, the cultural and institutional \nembeddedness of the actors in TNCs themselves also influences this process. \nMurphy (2003), for example, provides an insightful and detailed study of the way \ncredit, reputation and information spaces are used by workers in manufacturing \n 6\nindustries in Tanzania to facilitate their activities. These spaces can only be \nmaintained when appropriate, culturally-informed behaviours are exhibited by \nworkers familiar with local norms. Similar findings have been noted in relation to the \nway individuals negotiate spaces of learning and knowledge management in TNCs \n(Faulconbridge, 2006; Uzzi and Lancaster, 2003).  \nThe challenges of negotiating such spaces are, of course, all central to \ndebates in the varieties of capitalism literatures (Hall and Soskice, 2001; Gertler, \n2004). As Wrigley et al., (2005) reveal using the case study of globalizing retailers, \nfirms both rollout and adapt home-country practices overseas as a result of \ninstitutional heterogeneity and the associated variations in cultural norms. On \noccasions firms also engage in reverse-feedbacks where techniques learnt overseas \nare used in the home-country. Increasingly common are also attempts to change \nhost-country national institutional contexts and business systems. Whilst there is little \nagreement about the extent and effectiveness of such change, these strategies are \nincreasingly said to mean \u201cnational constellations should be thought of as \ncontinuously evolving manifestations of institutional conditions and economic \nstructures that support and influence one another in a reflexive manner\u201d (Bathelt and \nGertler 2005, 2). This, and the influence of transnational governance institutions and \nneoliberal discourses are ultimately said to be leading to subtle forms of change over \ntime in national systems (see W\u03ccjcik, 2006; Clark and W\u03ccjcik, 2005; Djelic and \nSahlin-Andersson, 2006), not necessarily towards a form of convergence and \nhomogeneity, but instead towards a state where there are converging divergences \n(Katz and Darbishire 2000).  \nTwo problems exist, however, in existing literatures that capture this \nphenomenon. First, they are unable to describe processes of change without \nreturning to the problematic binary of persistence versus convergence. As both \nBecker (2007) and Crouch (2005) argue, this is because approaches, such as that of \nHall and Soskice (2001), assume all parts of a national system are complementary \n 7\nand must change in unison. In searching for such paradigm-like shifts more subtle \nforms of instability are missed.  Some manage to skirt around such issues in \nempirical research more effectively than others (e.g. Morgan, 2006) and I want to \nsuggest here that the approach of relational economic geography might be useful for \nfurther resolving this problem, primarily because of its insistence of studying the finer \ndetails of place-specific institutional contexts. This provides the opportunity to unpack \nthe multifaceted nature of institutional contexts and reveal the way that change can \nbe partial and limited to certain elements of a system. Independent practice-level \nchanges, something obscured by studying systems as closed units under the title of \nAnglo-American, Japanese, liberal-market or otherwise, are in need of further study. \nAs Becker (2007) points out, the elements of a system that are most obviously \nfunctionally related to its core values might be less likely to change when put under \npressure by TNCs or other transnational institutions. However, the antecedents of \nwider change might be evolution in other less central components, something missed \nin existing studies. I attempt to consider such issues here. A second problem with \nexisting approaches, as Djelic and Sahlin-Andersson (2006) argue, is that studies \noften also fail to bring in the multitude of actors in TNCs involved in negotiating the \nmanagement and evolution of national institutional contexts. As Crouch (2005) notes, \nfirms need to be seen as institutional entrepreneurs and as active players in the \ndevelopment of institutional settings. Sensitivity to the \u2018relational geometries\u2019 that \ninfluence and are influenced by TNCs can help deal with this issue. For Yeung these \ngeometries \u201care neither actors (e.g. individuals and firms) nor structures (e.g. class, \npatriarchy and the state), but configurations of relations between and among them\u201d \n(Yeung, 2005, 38). Here I show how studying the way the agency of managers and \nworkers in TNCs, alongside the state and other actors, determines the strategies and \nbehaviours of TNCs when operating across diverse institutional contexts is a useful \nway to reveal the preconditions of change.  \n 8\nThe rest of the paper, therefore, examines the way the governance practices \nused in transnational law firms are defined as a result of three overlapping \ninfluences. First, the unique national varieties of professional, institutional and \ncultural context that characterize the work practices of lawyers in each country. \nSecond, a desire for the implementation of \u2018global\u2019 (usually home-country influenced) \nideals throughout the firm. And third, sector-specific socially constructed \nmanagement processes that determine the ways different actors in the firm exercise \ncontrol.  \n \nGlobalization, institutional contexts and varieties of professional practice in \ntransnational law firms \nThe emergence of a cadre of transnational law firms (see table 1) is an \nongoing process. The aim of these globalizing organizations, as one firm\u2019s promotion \nmaterial suggests, is \u201cto collaborate across all our offices and practices to deliver our \nservices to uniformly high standards, in a well rehearsed manner and for a \ncompetitive price\u201d (http:\/\/www.allenovery.com [accessed 3\/5\/2006]). However, as \nBeaverstock et al., (1999) describe, it could be argued that beyond Baker and \nMcKenzie few, if any of the other leading firms (table 1), are truly global1. Instead, the \nglobalization strategy of these firms has involved seeking out important locations \nfrom where key corporate clients can be served. Hence the term transnational is \noften used when referring to these firms to indicate the partiality of globalization \nprocesses and the continued influence of place and states over activities. \nNevertheless, as figure 1 shows, the number of strategically important locations that \n                                            \n1 Beaverstock et al., (1999) identified Baker and McKenzie, Clifford Chance and Coudert Brothers as \nthe only firms showing global tendencies \u2013 i.e. they had offices in all three major economic arenas \n(Europe, North American and South East Asia). Since this time Coudert Brothers have ceased \noperating.  \n 9\nleading firms operate in has grown in recent times (compare the locations to those \nhighlighted by Beaverstock et al., 1999). As a result, the managerial challenges \nassociated with creating local-global integration and embedded organizational \nnetwork forms have become multifaceted. Indeed, as Flood (1995, 175) notes, \u201cLaw \nfirms, as organisations, were originally built to function within particular societies with \nparticular mores. Now they transplant themselves across borders where the same \nprinciples and mores do note necessarily obtain. Inevitably there are strains\u201d.  \n[Insert table 1 and figure 1 somewhere here] \n \nOne of these strains, alongside the fact that law itself remains a nationally \nfragmented system, is the need for firms to hire lawyers trained and qualified to \npractice in each of the jurisdictions they operate in. Law, as a formal profession with \ndefined regulatory authorities and closure regimes to restrict entry to those with \nsuitable qualifications (see Abbott, 1984), has a powerful national institutional \ncontext. As Trubek et al., (1994, 411) suggest, each national jurisdiction exists as a \n\u2018legal field\u2019. As they describe, \u201cBy \u2018legal field\u2019 we mean the ensemble of institutions \nand practices through which law is produced, interpreted, and incorporated into \nsocial decision-making\u201d. One key contingency of each field is the peculiarities of the \nnational cultures and work practices of lawyers, what Trubek et al., (1994, 415-416) \ndescribe as \u201cThe actual behaviours of lawyers and others within a dynamic set of \nrelationships\u201d. This has been described elsewhere as the \u2018national system of the \nprofessions\u2019 and the \u2018varieties of professionalism\u2019 (Dietrich and Robins, 1990; \nFaulconbridge and Muzio, 2007; Lane et al. 2002; Nelson and Trubek, 1992; \nTorstendahl and Burrage, 1990) in work which dovetails with that on the varieties of \ncapitalism. This recognises the varying relationships that exist between a number of \nimportant actors to give each national \u2018field\u2019 its own unique identity and \ncharacteristics.  \n 10 \nTable 2 details the actors and their relational influence on national \nprofessional fields. The outcomes in terms of the peculiarities of each national \nsystem have been widely documented (Trubek et al., 1994; Flood, 1995). These \ninclude, first, differences in the way legislation informs the structuring of transactions \n(interpretation in civil law versus scientific application in common law). Second, \ninfluence over whether large law firms capable of managing large corporate mergers \nand restructurings are permitted. This in part determines the \u2018norms\u2019 of the working \nconditions of lawyers \u2013 i.e. whether they are used to working in large firms with their \nrelated formalities (see Morgan and Quack, 2005). This links to the third effect noted \nand the focus of the paper, the way institutional systems create nationally specific \nwork practices. This pertains to micro-scale factors such as how lawyers are \nmanaged, remunerated, treated at different stages of their career and, more broadly, \nhow lawyers behave in their day-to-day work.  Consequently, as Smigel (1965, 266) \nnotes, \u201cthe practicing organization (the large law firm) does not have to create its own \nrules to the extent that they are provided for by the outside agencies\u201d.  \nIt is somewhat surprising, then, that the way transnational law firms deal with \nthis spatially variegated legal practice and \u2018culture\u2019 has not been explored in detail. \nNot only does this offer insight into the way firms become embedded by the \ninstitutional contexts of the overseas locations they operate in but it also offers the \nopportunity to examine the affects of the strategies of firms on ongoing processes of \nchange in institutional contexts and business systems. As The Economist (1996) \nnoted, globalizing law firms have attempted to \u2018wrap red tape around the world\u2019 and \nconstruct a set of transnational norms for the delivery of corporate legal services. \nAgain, more sensitive analyses (e.g. Morgan and Quack, 2005) have managed to \ndescribe the subtleties of this process so as to dispute the homogenising thesis. \nHowever, even here the finer-grained details of change and its trajectory are often \nmissed. This is where the relational approach becomes useful. It draws our attention \nto changes at the practice-level and the role of managers and workers alongside the \n 11 \nother actors detailed in table 2 in determining the place-specific trajectories of this \nchange. Here I focus upon two of the seven components Hall and Soskice (2001) \nsuggest give a national system is characteristics -  employer-employee relations and \ntraining and education systems \u2013 and consider how law firms deal with international \nvariations in norms.  \n [Insert table 2 somewhere here] \n \n3) Managing local-global integration in law firms      \n \nMethodology \nThe following analysis is based upon insights from two sets of data. The main \nthemes of the analysis were explored and initial ideas developed through a series of \n29 interviews completed in 2003-2004. This was then supplemented with more \nfocussed discussions with 25 partners working for transnational law firms in London \nand New York in 2005-2006. It is data gathered from this latter round of interviews \nthat is presented below. These 25 interviews were with partners in 15 different firms. \nIndividuals held positions in several practice groups and had a range of differing \ncareer experiences (table 3). Partners (and not more junior lawyers) were selected \nboth because of their role in the negotiation and adaptation of firm practices and \nbecause of their positions, in theory at least, as autonomous co-owners of the firm \n(see below). All interviewees were quizzed about their approach to four main aspects \nof legal work (conflict of interest management; remuneration practice; practice group \ndivisional strategies; and training practice) as well as the importance and role of \nautonomy in their work, the type of managerial structures in place in the firm and the \nstrategies used for creating local-global integration. Interviews lasted between 35 and \n95 minutes and, with the exception of two, were recorded and fully transcribed. \nAnalysis was completed by coding the interview transcripts and identifying the key \n 12 \nthemes to emerge from discussions (table 4). All quotations used in the paper have \nbeen made anonymous to protect the identity of interviewees. \nWhile it would have been preferable to complete a more extensive set of \nfocussed interviews, this proved impossible2. Two limitations of the data should, then, \nbe noted. Interviews were only conducted in two cities, London and New York. Most \ninterviewees were, therefore, only able provide insights into on goings within offices \nlocated in those cities. The exception here was four interviewees who had worked in \nseveral offices of the firm. Consequently, away from the four firms in which interviews \nwere completed in both London and New York and in which partners with overseas \nexperience were interviewed it is more difficult to examine some of the subtle of \nvariations in practices between offices. Consequently discussions with lawyers \nwithout experience outside of the city they were interviewed in are only used to \nprovide insights into the norms of legal practice in their country of work.   \n \n[Insert tables 3 & 4 about here] \n \nDefining characteristics  \nAs noted, one of the strengths of relational analyses is their focus upon the \nmultiply embedded actors influencing the activities of TNCs. This allows us to not \nonly get to grips with the way institutional contexts emerge but also how the \ndifferential agency of actors in TNCs determines the way firms manage across \nheterogeneous contexts. This means it is important to understand how the social \n                                            \n2 These interviews were completed during a period of high demand for legal services and, many during, \nas one interviewee put it, the busiest summer on memory. Consequently it was not possible to secure \ninterviews with all of the original research design. Such difficulties in securing the access needed to \ndevelop extensive interview datasets with \u2018elite\u2019 actors in corporations has been well documented \n(Geoforum, 1999). As a result it is always necessary to approach such research pragmatically and to \nrecognise the limitations imposed by access restrictions on the collection of ideal datasets. \n 13 \nsystems of management in TNCs enhance or inhibit the influence of different parties \nand the way this influences the management of institutional heterogeneity. As both \nFerner et al., (2006) and L\u00f8wendahl (2000) argue, the chosen management strategy \nof a firm determines the extent to which actors in subsidiaries can negotiate with \nheadquarters about the implementation of (home-country influenced) governance \npractices. This is especially significant in the case of law firms. \nA core feature of a professional occupation such as law is the need for skill, \nknowledge and judgement to deal with undefined problems in everyday work \n(Dietrich and Roberts, 1997; Freidson, 2001; Raelin, 1991). Because of this, \nprofessionals normally resist being directly supervised or managed and place value \non having the freedom to organize and execute their work as they see fit. This facet \nof the management of PSFs has long been recognized, the result being, according to \nMintzberg (1979) and more recently Alvesson (2002), an \u2018adhocracy\u2019 \u2013 a style of \norganization that prioritizes the discretion of individual professionals rather than \ncontrol by management. This contrasts with the accepted norm in most \nmanufacturing firms where direct managerial control and hierarchies \u2013 what \nMintzberg (1979) calls bureaucracy \u2013 are used to coordinate and supervise activities. \nFurther distinguishing the behaviour of key actors in a unique stratum of PSFs is the \nuse of the partnership model of governance (Empson and Chapman, 2006). In this \nsystem those granted partnership become the co-owners and, therefore, joint \nmanagers of the firm. All law firms, as with accountants, operate as partnerships \nbecause of regulation preventing the commercial structuring and public ownership of \nsuch practices3. This is said to, first, remove commercial pressures from the delivery \nof such \u2018public safeguard\u2019 services. Partnerships are not responsible to shareholders \n                                            \n3 This has begun to change in some countries with the Clementi reforms in the UK making it possible \nfor the first time for law firms to be structured as commercial organizations with shareholders. \n \n 14 \nand do not have to provide \u2018shareholder value\u2019 or \u2018returns on investment\u2019. Second, \npartnership creates \u2018reputation\u2019 advantages for firms. Because of the intangible \nnature of professional services and the inability of the client to judge its quality, being \ngoverned by partnership and having co-owners as service deliverers is seen as a \nway of indicating the commitment of all providing the service to high levels of quality \n(Empson and Chapman, 2006)4.   \nCombined the values of professionalism and the partnership logic mean senior \npartners or those given the title \u2018managing partner\u2019 are not managers as exist in \nhierarchically structured manufacturing or non-professional serve firms. Lazega \n(2001) describes how partnerships are, nonetheless, more efficient than they might \nfirst appear because of their relational nature. Individuals can only succeed if they \nstrategically negotiate the support of their peers both with work but also in exercising \ninfluence over decision-making. The most influential partners are those who have \ncultivated such relational assets over time and, in particular, those partners who can \nprovide work for others and thus command their respect (see also Lazega and \nKrackhardt, 2000). Consequently it is often the way these influential partners, who \nare often given the title of \u2018managing\u2019 or \u2018senior\u2019 partner\u2019, deal with the resistance \nfrom other lawyers to \u2018management decisions\u2019 that is key to the successful \ncoordination of firms. \nThese peculiarities of law firm management affect the way key actors in law \nfirms manage the spatially contingent institutional conditions of professional practice. \n                                            \n4 The commitment to quality is thought to be secured in two ways. First, partners have to provide \ncapital from their own salaries to support the firm. This capital is used to fund the opening of new \noffices and other strategic ventures. If the firm fails, due to poor client relations or otherwise, the \npartners lose their capital, as happened to partners at Coudert Brothers when the firm was wound up in \n2005. Second, partners are liable to varying degrees if the firm is sued for negligence. The limited \nliability model of partnership has slightly changed this, limited the amount that partners are liable for \nand using insurance to cover anything in excess of set limits.   \n 15 \nAs Jones (2002) has previously argued, a high degree of consultation is needed in \nthe decision making and \u2018management\u2019 process in PSFs. This was reflected in \ninterviews when, again and again, lawyers (particularly those working for English \nfirms) commented upon the fact that rarely was a decision made or \u2018strategy\u2019 \nimplemented without consultation with all the partners. It was recognized that \nanything more than a very small group of unhappy individuals could lead to disaster. \nIndividuals might refuse to implement the decisions made or, alternatively, leave the \nfirm, taking their intellectual capital with them. As one lawyer summarized the \nsituation:  \n\u201cOne of the reasons professionals, and particularly lawyers, become professionals is \nthey are quite defensive and proud of the fact that they have a considerable amount \nof autonomy. And one of the issues that any management in a law firm has to deal \nwith is the trade of between maintaining lawyers autonomy and\u2026developing a \n[global] strategy that lawyers can buy into\u201d (2).  \n \nAs the quotation suggests, lawyers were nonetheless aware of the need for some \ndegree of coordination in large-scale transnational firms. However, even within firms \nthere was disagreement about the extent to which autonomy should be constrained \nby this. While the English lawyer quoted above described the importance of \nrecognising lawyers\u2019 desire for autonomy, an American colleague in the same firm \nsuggested an alternative strategy. As he put it, \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anywhere near \nenough management\u2026the approach we take [respecting partners\u2019 autonomy] makes \nmanagement clunky and less efficient than it should be (22). Nevertheless, in all of \nthe firms studied the partnership governance mechanism continues to require major \nmanagement decisions to be authenticated through an all-partner vote. This \ninevitably requires consultation and consensus building and as the American lawyer \nquoted above noted:   \n 16 \n\u201cif you picked up a management textbook you would read that the critical tools of \nmanagement include the ability to hire and fire and set the compensation. The tools \navailable to the [firm x] management do not include the \u2018hire and fire\u2019 and setting \ncompensation\u201d (22). \n \nAt the same time \u2018managers\u2019 within law firms will still exercise forms of agency \ndesigned to drive-through change and alter the perspectives of workers in overseas \noffices so as to allow for more integrated forms of operation. These tactics seem \nlikely to be intimately linked to the gradual and incremental changes in national \ninstitutional systems described by others (Bathelt and Gertler, 2005; Djelic and \nSahlin-Andersson, 2006; Yeung, 2001) and, when successful, allow firms to \nconstantly reassess the degree of geographical contingency needed in the \nmanagement of each office. This is, however, always going to be tainted in law firms \nby the professional systems discussed above, something that highlights why an \nactor-centred analysis of the effects of TNCs on institutional practices is so valuable. \nIn non-professional services such as retail or manufacturing responses are likely to \nbe influenced by different types of relationship between managers and workers \nleading to the implementation or adaptation of home-country practices in alternative \nways. Below I consider how the peculiarities of professional values might influence \nthe strategies of law firms and the way firms deal with variations in four work-\npractices. I do this whilst promoting a practice-level analysis of institutional \nconditions. \n \n4) Structuring transnationally and locally embedded practice \nTable 5 provides analysis of the way institutional agents and legacies affect \nthe work culture of lawyers in relation to conflict of interest management, \nremuneration practice, divisional strategies and training practice. Because of the \ndistinctive nature of approaches in each jurisdiction that are determined by various \n 17 \ninfluential actors (table 2), and the autonomous preferences of lawyers that require \n\u2018management\u2019 techniques sensitive to their expectations and values, law firms are \nforced to find governance strategies that are flexible enough to enable a compromise \nto be reached between the need for global alignment and local embeddedness. The \nrest of section, therefore, draws on the typology of Bartlett and Ghoshal (1998) as a \nheuristic for identifying the four \u2018ideal-type\u2019 approaches available to transnational law \nfirms for overcoming these challenges. In this typology four approaches are \ndescribed: \n\u2022 Global \u2013 where headquarters (HQs) create strategies and \u2018best practice\u2019 all \nsubsidiaries implement;  \n\u2022 International \u2013 where HQs defines strategy that each subsidiary implements \nusing their own forms of practice;  \n\u2022 Multinational \u2013 where each subsidiary defines its own strategies and practice; \n\u2022 Transnational \u2013 where vertical (between HQs and subsidiaries) and \nhorizontally (subsidiary-subsidiary) consultation leads to firm-wide negotiated \nand agreed strategies and \u2018best practice\u2019.   \n \n[Insert table 5 about here]   \nThe empirical material revealed that, firms do not use one of these \u2018ideal type\u2019 \nmodels to globalize. Instead complex relational geometries produce inconsistent \nresponses to the roll out of home-country systems, both between countries but also \nwithin different elements of one national system. This means combinations of the four \nmodels are adopted differently in each country so as to respond to degrees of \ndistinctiveness that exist at the level of individual practices. Examples of how \nEnglish-originating transnational law firms, in which multiple interviews were \ncompleted, have experienced this challenge are examined below whilst table 6 \nprovides examples of the way US-originating firms use the different approaches. This \n 18 \nis significant because, as I show in the next section, the way firms use such \napproaches varies depending on home-country influences as well as the context of \nthe host-country, something complicated by the fact that the influence of the latter \nalso changes over time.  \n \nGlobal coordination \nWhen used, globally uniform policies are accepted by lawyers primarily \nbecause professional logics in relation to the issues being managed are influenced in \na limited way by forms of \u2018local\u2019 or \u2018societal\u2019 embeddedness (Hess, 2004). This is the \ncase when lawyers have a number of shared approaches and values and, therefore, \nthe adaptation of home-country strategies is unnecessary. An important example of \nthis is the worldwide control by management committees of conflict of interest \nstandards. This existed in all of the firms studied in because of the forms of \ntransnational best practice described in table 5. Despite variations in the \ntechnicalities of a conflict, corporate lawyers worldwide tend to accept and use US or \nUK standards. As one lawyer argued: \n\u201cwe have structures to avoid conflicts \u2026We\u2019re a transaction driven firm and you don\u2019t \nwant a situation where you could have had a primary role on a deal but because \nsomeone had done something small in the past you\u2019re going to get dinged.\u201d (9). \n \nTable 6 provides examples of when global coordination is used by US firms as well \nas examples of their use of the international and multinational approaches discussed \nbelow.  \n[Insert table 6 here]   \n \nInternational coordination \nWhen there are cultural, institutional legacies influencing the practices of \nlawyers the global approach is inappropriate. \u2018International\u2019 coordination is, therefore, \n 19 \nused in transnational law firms when degrees of firm-wide coherence are needed but \nwhen global approaches threaten to excessively impede the autonomy of individuals \nor create \u2018culture\u2019 clashes due to moderate degrees of variation in the approaches to \nand \u2018norms\u2019 of legal practice. Such \u2018moderate\u2019 degrees of variation usually exist when \nthe basic principles and values of the profession have always been or have become \nsimilar in two countries. Outside of a professional setting the implementation of global \nstandards might be expected.  \nOne example of this is the way several English firms manage the structuring \nof practice groups in the USA (New York specifically). Transnational firms ideally \nneed the same types of legal practice to be developed in every office so global \nprojects can be managed through cross-border teams. For example, if a TNC is \nmerging with a rival and anti-trust advice is needed relating to multiple jurisdictions it \nis essential that lawyers with expertise in this issue exist in each office. However, one \ninterviewee that had experience of working in multiple offices of an English firm \ndescribed the \u2018international\u2019 approach used to deal with differences in the norms of \npractice group use and structuring in the USA as follows: \n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit like Vogue magazine. The magazine is published in 31 countries and each \none has some common elements but at the same time all the countries are able to \ndevelop their own unique features to reflect local markets and expectations\u2026A good \nexample is how the M&A, finance and securities practices are organized in the firm. \nIn the UK, each one is very separate, despite often working together. So there are \nclear teams for each. Here in the US they are much more blended together, so we\u2019ve \nkind of merged the three and even located them together in the office\u201d (16).    \n   \nIn this scenario the New York office, and individuals within it, had the freedom to \ndevelop practice groups as they see fit as long as the core group of services are \nprovided. An international approach is suitable because of the degrees of \nconvergence that exist (practice groups are common in both jurisdictions and \n 20 \nexpected by lawyers) yet the local institutional nuances at the fringes (see table 5 for \ndiscussion of the processes creating such a situation). Failing to recognise such \n\u2018cultural\u2019 subtleties can be detrimental to the success of an overseas office. As one \ninterviewee in New York working for a different English law firm that hadn\u2019t \nrecognised the important variations in practice group composition commented in \nrelation to the recent decision of managing partners to disband in New York the \ngroup that [description role], \u201cThe decision was made not to have a trust and estates \npractice even though it\u2019s normal and unfortunately that can help in my work in New \nYork. And that\u2019s one of those things where economically it was a wise decision not to \nhave it, but certainly it would be preferential for me and it\u2019s made me uncomfortable \nwith things\u201d (19). In a context where professional values are less influential more \nglobal structures might be expected. However, because of the need to avoid the type \nof upset caused by such actions and the negative effects on the performance of the \nfirm when lawyers react against decisions they find uncomfortable through either exit \n(leaving the firm) or voice (openly challenge management decisions) this is not the \ncase in law firms.   \n \nMultinational coordination \nWhen the institutional legacies affecting professional values create \nfundamental spatial variations in practice with little cross-jurisdiction commonality, \nand when these values have strong and powerful legacies that continue to influence \nlawyers, protracted transnational negotiations serve little purpose and each office is \nleft to define and implement its own \u2018national\u2019 organizational strategies. At one level \nthis is necessary because of the nationally-specific nature of law. This is the \nregulatory embeddedness many firms experience. In addition, variations in the \ncultural norms of workers are also significant. For example, differing national cultures \ninfluencing the way newly recruited lawyers are treated and trained also require the \n 21 \nuse of multinational strategies. Differences between the practices used in England, \nthe USA (New York) and Germany help explain the reasons for such variations.  \nIn England it is widely accepted that having a dedicated cadre of \u2018professional \nsupport lawyers\u2019 is essential. These are not paralegals as in the US sense and do not \nengage in any fee-earning work. Rather, this is a group of support staff that, amongst \nother things, provide training for interns5. Trainees in England also usually sit in the \nsame office as a partner. This facilitates regular mentoring as trainees work \nalongside and observe partners. These norms are a result of the way lawyers\u2019 \ntraining is regulated in England. Here law graduates must complete a two year \ntraining contract whilst working as an \u2018intern\u2019 at a law firm. This programme is \nscrutinized by The Law Society and requires partners to mentor trainees and write \nreports on their performance. Only on successful completion of this programme do \nindividuals become fully licensed lawyers. English firms tried and would still like to \nimplement the professional support lawyer and office sharing systems in all of their \nbranches. However, there is no regulatory requirement elsewhere for such \narrangements and consequently training norms are very different. In New York \npartners feel that it is inappropriate to share office space with their subordinates. As \none New York-based lawyer familiar with the English approach because of the time \nhe had spent in London commented, \u201cIf I got a partner here and told him to share an \noffice with a first year associate he\u2019d be out the door \u2013 so we don\u2019t \u2013 partners get the \nbig offices to themselves\u201d (24). In the USA graduates from law school must pass the \nState BAR exam in order to become a registered lawyer and partners and associates \ntend to live very different lives and only interact as and when work requires. One US \n                                            \n5 Other duties of professional support lawyers include the maintenance of knowledge \nmanagement systems, the provision of legislative updates to all lawyers through newsletters \nand briefing sessions, and the development of electronic resources such as online precedent \ndatabases. \n 22 \nlawyer commented upon the fact that \u201cthey [partners] just expect people by osmosis \nto figure it out.  And that\u2019s how I learned, I taught myself.  And it\u2019s very hard and a lot \nof people fall through the cracks, but that\u2019s just how it is\u201d (25).  \nThe German offices of English firms operate with different dynamics again. \nThe need for trainees to complete a range of formal exams suggests greater \nemphasis on formal learning and \u2018legal scholarship\u2019 than exists in the USA or \nEngland. To become a qualified lawyer in Germany individuals must first complete a \nfour to five year degree programme and pass their first state examination (the erstes \nStaatsexamen). They then have to fulfil a two year training contract (the \nReferendariat) and finally sit a second state exam (the zweites Staatsexamen) (see \nLane et al., 2002). The German offices of transnational law firms usually take \ngraduates after completing the erstes Staatsexamen and then provide the necessary \ntraining to complete the following stages. Training in Germany is, then, designed \nusing the German \u2018technik\u2019 logic that emphasizes quality through the creation of \nexpertise in employees (see Gertler [2004] for discussion of a similar process in \nmanufacturing). Trainees and also partners consequently spend a large amount of \ntime studying \u2018the law, something which is required in many civil law jurisdictions but \nconsidered unusual in the common law jurisdictions that transnational firms emerge \nfrom. As a lawyer who had worked in Germany for a number of years commented \nabout his German colleague\u2019s behaviour: \n\u201cAnd there\u2019s the German lawyer who does the excellent research pieces and a \ncontributing editor to 300 books and teaches at a university, all of which is good, but \nhow are we going to pay for this?\u2026So it\u2019s the same basic structure but the German \npartner says I\u2019ve this huge profile because I\u2019m a leading author\u201d (21)  \n \nTransnational law firms thus do not always aim to create aligned global working \npractices and organizational firms. Proven human resource best practices such as \nthe office sharing used by English law firms in London are not implemented \n 23 \nuniversally as a result, something that in a non-professional context would be \navoided through the use of international strategies that respect regulatory variations \nbut override cultural norms.  \n \nTransnational negotiation  \nAs both Gertler (2001) and Whitley (2001) suggest, there are few examples of \nwhat might be termed \u2018strong convergence\u2019, where the home-country systems of a \nfirm are influenced by overseas experience and subsequently reconfigured. More \ncommon is transnational negotiation that leads to home-country norms being applied \noverseas but in a mutated form. Such negotiation is used by transnational law firms \nwhen a globally coordinated approach is considered important for the successful \nfunctioning of the firm but where there are significant variations in culture and norms \nbetween jurisdictions. For example, remuneration models are a constant source of \ntension in transnational law firms. This has been noted most extensively in relation to \nthe differences between remuneration logics where the prevalence of \u2018eat what you \nkill\u2019 in the USA is matched by the prevalence of the \u2018lockstep\u2019 system in England (see \ntable 5). Firm x, a major English firm in table 1, faced just such a challenge when \nopening an office in New York and as one of the London-based managing partners \ncommented: \n\u201cthe dominant culture of our firm is very much a consensus driven, collegiate, \nlockstep driven institutional business. And that, to some lawyers in the States, is \ndeeply unattractive\u2026That means we\u2019re not going to grow as fast as we would \nlike\u2026But our conclusion has been that its better to have a business in the US that\u2019s \naligned to our overall culture than to allow it to develop as a separate sub-culture\u201d (2). \n \nA lawyer in the New York office of the same firm also recognised this challenge. As \nhe put it, \u201cI think there are very very significant cultural benefits that come from a \nshared lockstep system\u2026[but] you know, that\u2019s [also] caused a migration of talent \n 24 \naway from the firm, it has diminished profitability\u2026It is not a system that has its first \ngoal profit maximisation and if that\u2019s your first goal you\u2019re repelled by it\u201d (22). \nSpatially variable remuneration models that would cater for such differences are \nconsidered unsuitable in the global professional partnerships used in law firms. \nLawyers expect their peers to be paid using the same formula worldwide. As the \nprevious quotation suggests, this can create tensions. Consequently, negotiations \nbetween partners, driven by the senior partner and those with power and influence, \nhave been necessary to find a compromise and way forward that all partners \nthroughout the world feel comfortable with. This involves the canvassing of opinion \nfrom partners in all offices, the development of proposals that allow the adaptation of \nhome-country models, and the championing of these proposals by managing \npartners, senior partners and others with influence so that when the all-partner vote \nis implemented the vast majority have been convinced of the new model\u2019s legitimacy.  \nUltimately the partnership in firm x agreed to a modified lockstep model that resulted \nin the adaptation of home-country norms to allow \u2018super points\u2019 to be awarded in \nrecognition of the predominance of \u2018eat what you kill values\u2019 in some jurisdictions. A \nquicker and simpler to implement global approach may well seem logical in other \ncontexts where professional values do not influence the management of the firm.   \n \n \n5) Spatial, temporal and home-country complications in the management of \ninstitutional difference \nThe discussion above highlights how the need to \u2018negotiate\u2019 with partners and \nappease their autonomous tendencies, alongside the influence of the state, \nprofessional bodies and educational institutions, leads to professional service firms \nbeing particularly sensitive to institutional difference and managing in what could be \ndescribed as inefficient and irrational manners. The multinational management \npractices described are indicative of this with cultural alignment to local professional \n 25 \nnorms being given higher priority than the rollout of home-country strategies. \nNevertheless, as the example of transnational negotiation suggests, this does not \nmean \u2018managers\u2019 in firms abandon all hope of rolling out home-country practices \noverseas. Consequently firms use a combination of the four approaches outlined \nabove depending on degrees of difference between home- and host-country systems \nat the practice-level and the success of attempts to change norms. For example, the \n\u2018international\u2019 approach used by a US firm in Germany for promotion to partnership \n(table 6) is not used in London. Instead, \u2018global\u2019 coordination used with standard US \nprocedures in place because of the smaller degrees of variation and forms of \nconvergence in norms that exist. Similarly the South East Asian offices of English \ntransnational law firms are more often managed using multinational coordination than \nother offices. Regulatory restrictions prevent foreign law firms entering the market in \nmany countries unless they form an alliance with indigenous firms where over fifty \npercent of ownership is local. Consequently, multinational coordination is the only \nway to accommodate the practices of lawyers that are first and foremost determined \nby the local cultures of the partner firm. This reflects the unique nature of \u2018Asian \nbusiness systems\u2019. As Yeung (2001) describes, although these have evolved in \nrecent times as a result of various forms of global influence (including overseas \ntrained managers and graduates) the systems continue to retain many of their \ndistinctive characteristics and diverge from Anglo-American practices in many ways. \nThe same is true for the legal field (The Lawyer, 2006). As one managing partner in a \nUK firm described: \n\u201cour Asia offices\u2026have a higher degree of autonomy.  Not withstanding the \ndevelopments in information technology and communications, they are a long way \naway and have different approaches. So the influence is diluted\u2026they\u2019re actually left \nto get on with it, so they have a higher degree of autonomy is all respects (2).         \n \n 26 \nSuch static descriptions of management strategies do not fully reveal, however, the \ncomplexity the changes that occur over time as a result of the agency of managers in \ntransnational law firms. Comments made by those with direct experience of working \nin multiple European jurisdictions, particularly France and Germany, highlighted how \nthe challenges of institutional can be overcome using tactics designed to change the \nbehaviours of lawyers (see Clark and W\u03ccjcik, 2005; Djelic and Sahlin-Andersson, \n2006; Faulconbridge, 2007; Morgan and Quack 2005 for examples of similar \nprocesses). This has made it possible for more and more international and global \nstrategies to be implemented (figure 2). One lawyer provided the following example \nof the affect of this on his firm\u2019s French operations: \n\u201cThey [the French] never liked the name and approach of [English firm x] as they\u2019ve \nseen it as an Anglo Saxon\u2026That\u2019s changed now and [firm x] has now become a \ndominant name in the French marketplace.  And it\u2019s partly to do with what I call the \nEuropeanization or the Anglo-Saxon-ization of Europe\u201d (2). \n \n[Insert figure 2 somewhere here] \nThis raises questions about the strategies used by firms to drive such change and \nalso the wider impacts on host-country systems. Significantly the extent to which \nsuch change occurs is geographically variable (see also Gertler, 2001; 2004; W\u03ccjcik, \n2006). Transnational law firms has primarily been on the practice and organization of \nlaw firms in major world cities (Beaverstock et al., 1999) and not \u2018second order\u2019 cities \n(e.g. Birmingham in England) where offices often do not exist. Consequently, as one \ninterviewee noted:  \n\u201cGermany...They\u2019ve got a lot of financial institutions there so they\u2019ve had to adapt and \nFrankfurt firms are now very good competitors for London whereas the rest [other \nfirms in Germany] are still catching up\u201d (1). \n \n 27 \nMoreover, change only occurs in relation to some and not all practices, as the \ncontinued use of multinational coordination of training reveals It should not, then, be \nassumed that type of change described in figure 2 is leading to \u2018strong convergence\u2019 \n(Gertler, 2001). Nevertheless, further future investigation of the mechanisms and \nimpacts of such change would seem warranted.  \n    \n6) Conclusions \nThe work of Whitley (2001) suggests that the strategies and spatial variability \ndescribed above should be expected because of how the degree of difference \nbetween home and host country systems determines the extent to which practices \ncan be transferred smoothly. However, the findings presented here highlight two \nimportant issues missed in existing analyses.  First, and developing the argument of \nCrouch (2005), the analysis in this paper highlights the need to focus upon the \nintricacies of systems that are often presented as coherent units such as Anglo-\nAmerican or liberal market economies. As the data presented reveals, the responses \nof firms to institutional heterogeneity is conditioned by differences at the level of the \npractices that make up national systems (e.g. remuneration and associate training). \nThe use in any one country of both global (convergence driving) and multinational \n(persistence promoting) strategies provides evidence of this. The relational economic \ngeography approach helps reveal the way this practice-level variation and \nmanagement effects transnational law firms because of its insistence on .  \nSecondly, the paper reveals how the challenge of managing institutional \nheterogeneity is exaggerated in law firms by the principles of professional autonomy \nand partnership, the values of which underlie management systems. At the simplest \nlevel this highlights the importance of recognising sectoral differences in the ways \nTNCs manage across institutional heterogeneity. Studies of these issues in the \ncontext of manufacturing (e.g. Gertler, 2004) have outweighed studies of services \n 28 \nuntil recently when, for example, retail has acted as empirical lens for analysis (Coe \nand Lee-Sook; Wrigley et al., 2005). Consequently there has been an \nunderestimation of the importance of studying the differences between industries and \nof how the social systems of management and the resultant variations in the agency \nof workers and managers affect the way firms rollout or adapt home-country \npractices. The relational approach and its fine-grained, textured analysis of the \nsocially constructed geometries influencing firms and change in institutional systems \nwould seem an ideal of way of approaching this challenge. Indeed, the agency \ndescribed above acts at the level of practices rather than on systems as coherent \nunits. The result is a process of change that may be partial in any one country as the \nless persistent values are altered first leaving other core and persistent features in \ntact, at least initially. This can be seen in the way firms evolve their approaches to \nmanagement and go from using multinational to international approaches over time \nfor certain practices but not others.     \nTogether these two insights into the strength of the relational approach for \nanalysing the way TNCs negotiate and influence national institutional systems opens \nup a number of avenues for future research. In particular further examining the ways \nTNCs negotiate diverse business contexts through management strategies with a \npractice-level epistemology is likely to allow economic geographers to move beyond \nthe polarised and simplified debates about persistence versus convergence that have \nplagued many literatures (Lane, 2003). As the analysis presented here suggests, the \neffects of TNCs actions sometimes, but not always, results in change, but change \nthat is unlikely to lead to aligned worldwide systems (convergence). At the same time \nthough systems are equally unlikely to remain completely untouched by the \ninfluences of globalization (persistence). Instead what might be termed converging \ndivergences seem most likely (Katz and Darbishire, 2000), where some practices \nchange but others do not. To further develop this idea though we still need to know \nmore though about the tactics used to drive change and the way they facilitate \n 29 \nevolutions in both the perspectives of workers but also, where relevant, regulators \nand other institutional agents. This requires detailed empirical studies of the actions \nof influential managers in TNCs, the reactions of workers to strategies designed to \ndrive change and the wider effects on indigenous firms of the introduction of foreign \npractices. Addressing in a head-on fashion such questions might prevent debates \nabout the varieties of capitalism and change being another \u2018missed boat\u2019 for \neconomic geographers (Dicken, 2004).  \n \n \n \n \n \nAcknowledgements \nTBC \n \n \n \nReferences \nAbbott 1984 \nAlvesson, M. 2002.

Biographic data of interviewees. \n 38 \n \n \nPrinciple theme \nin analyses \n(ideas repeated \nby multiple \ninterviewees) \n \n \nMain issues raised \n \nIntricacies\/contradictions identified in \narguments made \n \nThe national \npeculiarity of \nlawyers work \npractices \n \n\u0001 The continued \ndistinctiveness of \nlawyers throughout \nthe world (see \ndiscussion in table 5 for \nfurther details) \n \n\u0001 The convergence of lawyers practices in the \nmain financial and business centres of the \nworld:  \nSeveral lawyers suggested that over the past ten \nyears lawyers in London, New York, Frankfurt, \nParis etc. had converged around a global \u2018mega-\nlaw\u2019 norm \n \n \nThe need to \nhave \ncoordinated \nmanagement but \nwith the option \nfor place-specific \nvariations in \npractice \n  \n \n\u0001 The need to have \nsome global norms \nbut also sensitivity to \n\u2018local\u2019 cultural \npeculiarities; \n\u0001 The inability to \u2018tie the \nnetwork together\u2019 as \ntightly as might like \n \n\u0001 The need to recognise that the bigger the firm \nthe less it can adapt to local peculiarities: \n \nTwo lawyers believed developing more global best \npractices that all offices implement is important \n \nOne firm had \u2018global\u2019 procedures that had to be \nfollowed when working for one the firm\u2019s TNC \nclients \n \nThe need to give \neach office and \nits partners input \ninto discussions \nabout the \ngovernance of \nwork practices \n \n\u0001 Global committees \nneeded that have \nmembers from each \noffice or at least each \nregion who can raise \nconcerns with plans; \n\u0001 Practice group heads \nand managing \npartners in each \noffice to voice the \nopinion of their \nconstituents about \ngovernance practices \n\u0001 Total local autonomy \nwhere justified \n \n \n\u0001 The need for \u2018partners with power\u2019 (usually in the \nhome country) who can force partners in other \noffices to follow firm-wide practices: \n \nIn a number of US firms especially there existed \nan elite strata of partners who, because of their \nfee-earning ability (the finders) could force through \nchanges elsewhere, even when created negative \neffects on overseas offices \n \nTable 4. The three substantive themes and sub-themes that emerged from the coding of \ninterviews and contradictory themes which emerged.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 39 \n \nGovernance \nissue \n \n \nMain \nvariations in \npractice \n \nMain influences \n \nExemplary variations \n \nConflict of \ninterest \nmanagement  \n \nLimited \nvariations \u2013 in \nmost countries \ntransnational \nlaw firms \noperate in \nsimilar \nprocedures \nexist and \nUK\/US \ndefinitions of \nconflicts \naccepted. \n \nState \u2013 The US and UK \napproach to creating a \nlegal profession and the \nprinciples associated with \nit has often been \nmimicked in other \ncountries because of the \nearly emergence of an \nindependent legal \nprofession in these \ncountries. \n \nClients and transnational \nlaw firms \u2013 UK\/US \nstandard now forms a \nglobal norm all lawyers \nadhere to. Failure to do \nso prevents lawyers \nworking for transnational \nclients and is thus \nemerging as a \ntransnational forms of \ngovernance (see Morgan \nand Quack, 2005). \n \nN\/A \n \nRemuneration \npractice  \n \nThe \u2018eat what \nyou kill\u2019 system \nwhere partners \nare paid \ndepending on \nprofits \ngenerated \nversus the \n\u2018lockstep\u2019 \nmodel where \nseniority not \nperformance \ndetermines \nremuneration \n \nLaw schools \u2013 the ethos \nof legal work instilled in \ntrainees varies between \ncountries. This \ndetermines whether \nsuccess is defined \ncompetitively or as a \nresult of teamwork and \nlong-term commitment to \nthe firm   \n \nEat what you kill is common in \nUS corporate law firms. US law \nschools instil competition into \ntrainees. All exams and then the \ncohort of graduates are ranked \nby year group. Individuals are \nsocialized into the spirit of \nindividualism reflecting Cravath\u2019s \nprinciples; the idea of a \n\u2018tournament of lawyers\u2019 where \neveryone competes for success \nand promotion continues \n(Galanter and Palay, 1981). More \nwidely this also reflects the \nneoliberal, competitiveness \ndiscourse that first emerged in \nthe USA and underlay economic \npolicy.  \nLockstep is more common in, \namongst others, English, and \nAustralian firms (see Hanlon \n(1999) for history of this model). \nThe lockstep ideal is reflected in \nlaw schools that do not rank \nexams or graduates (see \nBurrows and Black [1998] on the \nuse of the lockstep model in \n 40 \nAustralia). This has begun to \nchange in more recent times, \nespecially as neoliberal \ndiscourses have become \ndominant in the UK too.  \n \nDivisional \nstrategies;  \n \nThe use and \nstructuring of \npractice groups \nvaries from \nbeing extensive \nand formal to \nlimited and \ncontested \n \nThe state and \nprofessional associations \n\u2013 variations in regulation \nmean large law firms with \ndivisional structures are \nrelatively new or even \nbanned in some \njurisdictions. This \ninfluences whether \nlawyers are accustomed \nto acting as a generalist \nor a specialist in one \nelement of law in a \nspecialist practice group \nwithin a large firm.    \n \nClients \u2013 expectations in \nterms of whether lawyers \nare specialists in one field \nor generalist able to \nadvice on all aspects of a \ntransaction varies. \nIncreasingly large \ncorporations (and US\/UK \noriginating ones \nespecially) insist that \nfirms they employ provide \nsuch services \n \nLarge firms existed throughout \nthe twentieth century in the USA \ndue to an absence of restrictions \non firm size. Divisional structures \nquickly became common as the \nCravath model was copied. In \nEngland the ban on firms with \nover 25 partners was only lifted in \n1967. Consequently, until the late \n1980\u2019s few large firms existed.  \nDivisional structures have \nbecome more common recently \nbut are less institutionalised. As \nMorgan and Quack (2005) tell us, \nin Germany a very different \nsituation exists. Corporate law \nfirms didn\u2019t develop until the very \nfinal part of the twentieth century. \nLarge firms have only emerged \nsince 1989 when re-regulation \nmade firms employing more than \n10 lawyers feasible. \nConsequently many lawyers are \nstill grappling with the idea of no-\nlonger being a generalist in a \nsmall firm. A similar revolution is \njust beginning in many countries \nin South East Asia.    \n \nTraining \npractice and \nassociate-\npartner \nrelationships \n \nThe extent to \nwhich newly \nqualified \nlawyers receive \ntraining varies. \nAlso, the \nrelationship \nbetween \npartners and \nassociate can \nvary from \n\u2018master-\nservant\u2019 to \n\u2018mentor-\ntrainee\u2019. \n \nThe state and \nprofessional associations \n\u2013 these determine \nwhether formal training \nguidelines exist for newly \nqualified associates. This \ncan influence whether \npartners are compelled to \noversee the development \nof associates and the \ncharacteristics of this \nprocess.  \n \n \nSee section on multinational \ncoordination in main body of text \n \nTable 5.  Professional institutions and their effects on four governance issues  \n \n 41 \n \nForm of \ncoordination \n \nAspect of \nmanagement \n \n \nExplanation \n \nExemplary quotation \n \nGlobal  \n \nClient \nengagement \nletters that \ndefine levels of \nservice and \nwhat can be \nexpected from \nlawyers.  \n \nstandard letters provide best way to minimize \nclaims of negligence and the tried, tested and \ninternally scrutinized procedure mean they are \naccepted by lawyers as best practice. \n  \n \n\u201cChicago was the first office in the network and it has a feel of \nheadquarters because that\u2019s where all our IT is based, and its where all \nour business development reports into\u2026So it has a practical and \nadministrative feel\u2026our engagements letters for example are \nstandardized and decided upon by people there and we can\u2019t deviate \nfrom that because it defines what we do very tightly\u201d (1). \nInternational Promotion to \npartnership \nThe \u2018up or out\u2019 system where individuals either \nprogress to become a partner or leave has to be \npunctuated with mid-points in some jurisdictions to \nreflect the local culture of having managing \nassociates or junior partners. These individuals \nare not part of the global partnership and do not \nshare profits, but can still hold the title of partner \nand have national level privileges associated with \nthis. \n\u201cOne of the things that crops up is that in certain European jurisdictions, \nin particular Germany, there\u2019s been a tradition of becoming partners \nrelatively young in life. And that isn\u2019t the way the big US or English firms \noperate. And there it has been necessary to look at the local situation \nand come up with something that addresses the local requirement but \ndoesn\u2019t undermine the way we do things in London or New York. So you \nmight get \u2018national partners\u2019 or \u2018junior partners\u2019 or \u2018managing associates\u2019 \n- that sort of sensitivity needs to be taken account of\u201d (6). \nMultinational Knowledge \nmanagement \nThe importance partners place on expertise \nsharing and having support staff to organize \nknowledge management activities varies \nsignificantly between offices \n\u201cKnowledge management is a function of what is done differently in each \noffice. Part of the issue we have is that technically because of the \nlicensing you\u2019re not supposed to use a piece of software outside of the \ncountry it\u2019s licensed for, so you couldn\u2019t use our knowledge management \nsoftware in Singapore. And then there\u2019s the whole cultural thing \u2013 \nlawyers in New York don\u2019t like paying for support staff to run the \nsystems\u201d (14).  \n \n \nTable 6.
