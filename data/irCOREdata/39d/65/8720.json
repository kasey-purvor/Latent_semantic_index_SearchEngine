An indirect, competitive ELISA was developed for the rapid detection of cows\u2019 milk in the milk of goat, sheep, and buffalo. The assay uses a monoclonal antibody produced against bovine IgG. This antibody recognizes a species-specific epitope on the heavy chain of both bovine IgG1 and IgG2.

Once optimized, the ELISA was found to be highly specific. Detection limits of the assay are 1.0 \u00b5g\/mL of bovine IgG, or 0.1% (vol\/vol) adulteration with cows\u2019 milk. The assay was highly reproducible (CV < 10%) and performed equally well when used to detect bovine IgG in mixtures with the 3 types of milk tested. \\ud\n\\ud\nThe ELISA performance makes it suitable for development as a kit, for use in the field as a high throughput screening ELISA","downloadUrl":"","fullTextIdentifier":null,"pdfHashValue":null,"publisher":"American Dairy Science Association","rawRecordXml":"<record><header><identifier>\n        \n            \n                oai:chesterrep.openrepository.com:10034\/70436<\/identifier><datestamp>\n                2016-04-01T14:19:53Z<\/datestamp><setSpec>\n                col_10034_6967<\/setSpec><setSpec>\n                com_10034_610605<\/setSpec>\n            <\/header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:oai_dc=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/\" xmlns:dc=\"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/\" xmlns:doc=\"http:\/\/www.lyncode.com\/xoai\" xmlns:xsi=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/ http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc.xsd\" ><dc:title>\n            \n        \nMeasurement of bovine IgG by indirect competitive ELISA as a means of detecting milk adulteration<\/dc:title><dc:creator>\nHurley, Ian P.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nColeman, Robert C.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nIreland, H.
