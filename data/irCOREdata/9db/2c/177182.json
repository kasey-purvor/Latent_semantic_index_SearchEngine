The intervention is \nbased on social cognitive theory (SCT), self-regulation theory (SRT) and planning as \nevidence-based mediators of physical activity changes. Two classes, paired on social-\neconomic variables, were selected from each of eight Portuguese schools and randomly \nassigned to an intervention or control group (N=291). Primary outcome was \u2018moderate to \nvigorous physical activity\u2019 (International Physical Activity Questionnaire) measured pre and \npost intervention and at three and nine months follow-ups. SCT, SRT and planning variables \nwere secondary outcomes measured pre and post intervention. \nAt post test, participants in the intervention group reported 18 minutes per week more \nphysical activity (PA), adjusted for pre-intervention, age and sex , than those in the control \ngroup (95% confidence interval -10 to 46; p = .249). This difference increased to 33 minutes \n(95% CI \u2013 4 to 71; p = .082) at three months and to 57 minutes (95% CI 13 to 101, p= .008) at \nnine month follow-up. Moreover, the intervention resulted in changes of some of the \ntheoretical target variables, including outcome expectancies and coping planning. However, \nno evidence was found for the changes in theoretical moderators to mediate the intervention \neffects on behaviour. Implications for theory and for future research are discussed.  \n \n \nKeywords: physical activity, adolescents, planning, health promotion, social cognitive \nmodels, self-monitoring \nTheory-based Intervention to enhance Physical Activity Among Adolescents - 3 - \n A lack of physical activity (PA) is prevalent amongst adolescents (Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention, 1997; Varo, et al., 2003) and contributes to a tremendous health \nburden of obesity, type 2 diabetes and other chronic diseases in adolescence and over the \nlifespan (Mokdad et al., 2004; Ogden, Flegal, Carroll & Johnston, 2002; Ruiz et al., 2006). \nEffective interventions to increase (PA) are needed to prevent disease in adolescence and the \nearly development of sedentary lifestyle (Hallal et al., 2006; Marcus et al., 2000).  \nPrevious PA interventions were weakly effective (Dishman & Buckworth, 1996; Kahn \net al., 2002; Stone, McKenzie, Welk, & Booth, 1998) and maintenance of effects has been \npoor (Biddle, Gorely & Stensel, 2004). The majority of previous trials have been based in the \nUnited States and little evidence about behaviour change in European adolescents is available \n(Marcus et al., 2006). Many programs have failed to utilize evidence-based theory to identify \nkey determinants of behaviour change as targets for interventions (Baranowski, Anderson & \nCarmack, 1998; Dishman, et al., 2004; Marcus et al., 2000). Interventions addressing \nevidence-supported mediators of behaviour change are more likely to be effective as they \nbuild upon accumulative research. Moreover, applications of theory-based interventions \npresent an opportunity to test if an intervention successfully modifies the hypothesised \ndeterminants and if these changes mediate behaviour change effects (Baranowski, et al., 1998; \nMichie & Abraham, 2004). The present paper introduces the development and preliminary \ntest of a theory-based intervention based on social cognitive theory, self-regulation theory and \nplanning designed to enhance PA in adolescents. \nSocial Cognitive Theory \nSocial cognitive theory (SCT; Bandura, 1997) assumes that behaviour is guided by \nbeliefs that people acquire in their ongoing interaction with the environment; in particular \nbeliefs about the consequences of behaviour and individual capabilities. In line with other \nsocial-cognition theories, outcome expectancies, self-efficacy and goals are conceptualised as \nproximal causal determinants of behaviour change (Bandura, 1997; Fishbein et al., 1991). \nTheory-based Intervention to enhance Physical Activity Among Adolescents - 4 - \nIndividuals are more likely set a goal to change their course of action and adopt a new \nbehaviour if this new behaviour is expected to result in more favourable outcomes (action \noutcome expectancies) than previous behaviour (situation outcome expectancies) and if they \nfeel capable of performing the new behaviour (self-efficacy). A particular strength of SCT is \nthat it theorises about both, the determinants of behaviour change and the factors determining \nchanges in social cognitions, such as mastery experience, vicarious experience, persuasion \nand physiological feedback (Bandura, 1997). Numerous successful applications of SCT to PA \n(Dishman et al., 2004; Stone et al., 1998; Winters, Petrosa & Charlton, 2003) and other health \nbehaviours (Holden, Moncher, Schinke, 1990; Schwarzer & Luszczynska, 2006) provide \nevidence that SCT offers a sound background for PA interventions for adolescents.  \nFavourable social cognitions and action goals are necessary precursors for behaviour \nchange, but they do not guarantee action. People may fail to implement their intentions or to \ncope with self-regulatory problems. Recent research has suggested that post-decisional \nprocesses of goal pursuit play an important role in translating intentions into behaviour \n(Abraham, Sheeran & Johnston, 1998; Gollwitzer, 1999; Schwarzer, 2001).  \nSelf-Regulation Theory \nSelf-regulation theory emphasises self-monitoring and ongoing comparisons of current \nbehaviour against individual standards in order to reduce discrepancies (e.g., Carver & \nScheier, 1998; Kanfer & Goldstein, 1991). Prompting self-monitoring has been shown to be \neffective in behaviour modification (Bandura & Cervone, 1983: Lorig, et al., 1999). \nMoreover, exercising regular self-control improves self-regulatory capacity (Muraven, \nBaumeister & Tice, 1999). Goal setting and self-monitoring have been key components in \nmany successful health promotion programmes for adolescents (Sallis et al, 1997; Stone et al, \n1998; Tell & Vellar, 1987). \nTheory-based Intervention to enhance Physical Activity Among Adolescents - 5 - \nIf-then Plans in Self-regulation  \nThere is compelling evidence that advance planning of the when, where, and how of \ngoal pursuit facilitates the realization of intentions (Gollwitzer & Sheeran, 2006). If-then \nplanning involves defining the means one will utilise to reach their goals. In SCT, this might \nbe described as a graded hierarchical process of goal setting. Defining means-end \nrelationships may guide individual self-regulation in reducing discrepancies between current \nbehaviour and personal standards (Sniehotta, Scholz & Schwarzer, 2005). Moreover, the \nprospective if-then link (or implementation intention) leads to a cognitive representation that \nenhances the accessibility of specified cues and allows for swift and effortless initiation of the \nrespective goal-directed responses (Gollwitzer & Sheeran, 2006).  \nAction Planning refers to the specification of when, where and how to act in \naccordance with one\u2019s intention. Coping planning is a barrier-focused strategy to avoid \nunwanted responses to situational demands or social pressure. Coping plans represent a \nmental link between anticipated risk situations and suitable coping responses (Sniehotta, \nSchwarzer, Scholz & Sch\u00fcz, 2005). Individuals who have planned how to cope with risky \nsituations are more likely to maintain newly adopted behaviour in the face of difficulties \n(Marlatt, 1996; Simkin & Gross, 1996; Sniehotta, Scholz & Schwarzer, 2006; Ziegelmann, \nLippke & Schwarzer, 2006). However, few studies have applied planning as a self-regulation \naid in adolescents. Although not conclusive, there is some evidence that similar planning \neffects may be assumed in adolescents and adults (Ara\u00fajo-Soares, McIntyre & Sniehotta, in \npress; Mischel & Patterson, 1978; Gollwitzer & Sheeran, 2006). \nThe Health Promotion Programme \u201cIt\u2019s your body \u2013 use it well!\u201d \nThe programme \u201cIt\u2019s your body \u2013 use it well!\u201d was developed to provide theory-based \nguidelines for school-based health promotion in Portugal. Portuguese adolescents show some \nof the lowest levels of PA in Europe and an overall high prevalence of health risk behaviours \n(McIntyre et al., 1998; Riddoch, et al., 2004; WHO, 2000). The overall programme consists \nTheory-based Intervention to enhance Physical Activity Among Adolescents - 6 - \nof 12 weekly sessions and addresses health behaviours including PA, diet, physical and \npsychosexual development, prevention of risk behaviours (sexually transmitted diseases, \nsmoking and alcohol consumption), as well as general life skills such as assertiveness \n(McIntyre & Ara\u00fajo-Soares, 2002). The PA programme targeted SCT variables and post-\nintentional self-regulatory strategies such as planning and self-monitoring. Previous research \nhad shown that adolescents often lead sedentary lifestyles despite good intentions to be active \n(Ara\u00fajo-Soares, McIntyre & Sniehotta, in press; McIntyre et al., 1998; Riddoch et al., 2004).  \nThis paper reports findings from an opportunistic cluster-randomised controlled trial \nof the PA module. The term opportunistic refers to the fact that the sample size was \ndetermined by the availability of schools provided by the funder (Health Administration of \nNorthern Portugal) rather than by formal power analyses. Opportunistic trials provide \ninvaluable guidance when considering a potential full-scale trial in the future. They allow \ntesting the feasibility and acceptability of trial procedures, highlighting potential pitfalls to \navoid and providing evidence on likely effect sizes to inform power calculations. Although \nthe study was not powered to detect small effects, it allowed estimating the possible effect \nsize, making a contribution by a) detecting possible medium to large effects, b) cumulating \nevidence towards a full RCT (Campbell, et al., 2000) and c) providing data for systematic \nreviews. Our research questions were:  \n1.) What are the estimated group differences in changes of PA in children that received the \nintervention and those in the control group after the intervention and at three and nine months \nfollowing the intervention?  \n2.) What are the estimated group differences in changes in the theoretical mediators (outcome \nexpectancies, self-efficacy, goal commitment, action planning and coping planning) in \nchildren that received the intervention and those in the control group?  \n \nMETHOD \nTheory-based Intervention to enhance Physical Activity Among Adolescents - 7 - \nParticipants and Procedures \nEight schools from the Northern Portuguese districts of Minho, Tr\u00e1s-os-Montes, and \nDouro Litoral were available for this study. They fulfilled the following criteria 1) they were \nnot involved in the European Network of Health Promoting Schools in October 2002, 2) they \nhad a school psychologist and a physical activity teacher that could be trained to deliver the \nintervention and 3) had at least two classes of either 6th or 7th grades. Two classes from each \nschool, ten 6th grade (64.9%) and six 7th grade (35.1%) classes comprising 291 adolescents \nparticipated in the study. The mean age of participants in the initial sample was 12.13 years \n(SD = 1.01) with a range from 10 to 16 years, 76.2% of the participants ranged from 10 to 12 \nyears. About half of them were male (n=138, 47.4%), 57.4% lived in rural areas.  \nThe study used a cluster-randomised design. In each school two classes similar in \nsocio-demographic variables were selected and randomly assigned to intervention or control \ncondition after initial assessment. The full intervention consisted of 12 weekly sessions (90 \nminutes each), consisting of an initial session with parents (90 minutes), a general \nintroduction lesson for the children on the programme goals (90 minutes), and two 90 minute \nsessions based on a standardised intervention manual in consecutive weeks in a classroom \nsetting. The remainder sessions of the programme covered other goals such as healthy eating, \nthe prevention of sexually transmitted diseases and the prevention of smoking, alcohol and \nother illicit drugs. Assertiveness was another one of the topics covered.   \nPhysical activity, SCT variables and planning measures were taken at pre-test (3 \nweeks in advance of the PA intervention) and post-test (two week after completion of the PA \nintervention). In addition, PA was measured at 3-months and 9-months follow-up.  \nMeasures  \nThe primary outcome measure was physical activity assessed with the International \nPhysical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ; Craig et al, 2003) for adolescents using the seven-day \nrecall method. Children indicated how many sessions of activities they had engaged and how \nTheory-based Intervention to enhance Physical Activity Among Adolescents - 8 - \nlong each of these activities lasted. From this questionnaire a measure of general moderate-\nto-vigorous physical activity and exercise was derived consisting of a composite score that \nmultiplied the frequency of sessions per week with minutes per session. \nSecondary outcomes were SCT and planning measures. SCT measures were \ndeveloped based on a belief elicitation study and pilot studies (Ara\u00fajo-Soares, et al., in press; \nAra\u00fajo-Soares, 2006) following the guidelines of leading theorists (Ajzen, 2006; Bandura, \n2005). Participants were first introduced to the concept of moderate to vigorous PA. \nSituation-outcome expectancies were assessed by agreement with statements about negative \noutcomes resulting from the current levels of PA. The stem \u2018If I continue with my current \nlevel of PA\u2026\u2019 was followed by 7 statements such as \u2018I will become overweight\u2019. Action-\noutcome expectancies were assessed by 5 items addressing possible positive consequences of \nregular moderate to vigorous PA, for example: \u201cIf I engage in regular moderate to vigorous \nPA, I will have more energy and strength\u201d. Self-Efficacy was assessed by 10 items. The stem \n\u2018I am certain that I can engage in regular moderate to vigorous PA in the forthcoming months, \neven if...\u2019 was followed by 10 possible barriers such as a) \u2018\u2026I have to study for an exam\u2019. \nBehavioural Intentions were assessed by 6 items, e.g., \u2018I intend to engage in regular moderate \nto vigorous PA at least 2-3 times a week for at least 30 to 45 minutes outside school\u2019\u2019. Each \nitem was scored on a five-point Likert scale from completely disagree to completely agree.  \nAction planning and coping planning were measured using the Action Planning and \nCoping Planning Scales (Sniehotta, Schwarzer et al., 2005) adapted to adolescence. Action \nplanning was assessed by 4 items: \u2018I have made a detailed plan regarding [when\/where\/how] \nto engage in regular moderate to vigorous PA\u2019. Coping planning was assessed by 4 items, for \nexample \u2018I have made a detailed plan regarding...a) what to do when something interferes \nwith my plans (e.g. If I have a test in that week, if my friends want to go out, etc.). \nTwo pilot studies confirmed the factorial, construct and predictive validity of these \nscales (Ara\u00fajo-Soares, 2006).  A scale on self-reported self-monitoring was not included in \nTheory-based Intervention to enhance Physical Activity Among Adolescents - 9 - \nthis study, because the pilot study revealed difficulties in understanding the items of a self-\nmonitoring assessment scale. Mean values, standard deviations and correlations for Time 1 \nand Time 2 and \u03b1-coefficients for all scales are displayed in Table 1. \nIntervention \nThe intervention followed a detailed manual. The manual, materials and a detailed description \nof the program are available from the corresponding author.. The PA intervention consisted of \ntwo classroom-based sessions of 90 minutes each and related homework. It was delivered by a \ntrained psychologist assisted by a sports education teacher. The psychologist received \nmanual-based training including a two-day workshop (16 hours training) by the research \nteam. In addition, a member of the research team served as supervisor in preparation of each \nsession. In the week proceeding both PA intervention sessions, adolescents were asked to \nkeep a self-monitoring diary as part of their homework in which they documented their daily \nphysical activities in detail. After the intervention they were encouraged to keep the diary for \ntwo more weeks. During the sessions, working sheets and a brief three-minute film were used \nas additional materials. At the end of the sessions, each student received a leaflet, which \nemphasized the main topics of the session. Table 2 describes the intervention using a formal \ntaxonomy of behaviour change techniques by Abraham and Michie (in press) along with a \nconcise description of the procedures used to target the theoretical determinants of behaviour \nchange.  \nPilot studies \nFeasibility and acceptability of the intervention and the training procedures were \nestablished in a one-group design with pre, post and 9 months follow up, with 107 students \nfrom four different schools in Northern Portugal. A second pilot study tested the feasibility of \nthe trial procedures in a randomised design with matched control condition in 116 adolescents \n(46% male; Mean age=13.4; SD = 1.6). In the intervention group, the proportion of \nTheory-based Intervention to enhance Physical Activity Among Adolescents - 10 - \nparticipants reporting at least 3 sessions of physical exercise a week increased from 27% at \npre test to 48% at post-test in the intervention group (McIntyre & Ara\u00fajo-Soares, 2002).  \nData analyses \nDescriptive data for all outcomes are presented as means (standard deviations in \nparentheses) and correlation coefficients where relevant. Data were analysed using multilevel \nmodelling techniques; a three level random effects analyses of covariance linear regression, \nadjusting post-intervention PA at each time point for pre-intervention PA, age and sex. We \nused a nested design with children (level 1) nested within classes (level 2) nested within \nschools (level 3). Although we have repeated measures within child we used each post \nintervention time point as an outcome and correct for pre intervention levels of PA because \nintroducing a fourth level to the analyses would complicate the analyses more than desirable \ngiven the sample size. Random effects were included for school and class to account for \npotential intra-cluster correlation (Rabe-Hesketh & Skrondal, 2005). Changes in cognition \nwere also explored using this model. Effect sizes are presented with 95% confidence intervals. \nMissing data were assumed to be missing completely at random because the students \ndiscontinuing the study moved to other schools. All analyses were therefore conducted as \ncomplete cases intention-to-treat analyses (Wood, White & Thompson, 2004; Wood, White, \nHillsdon & Carpenter, 2005). To test the robustness of the results to this assumption we also \ncarried out a conservative sensitivity analysis imputing the baseline levels of PA for any \nmissing data. Potential mediation was investigated following standard criteria (Baron, & \nKenny, 1986) in a three-level multilevel regression framework as above. Stata Version 9.2 \nwas used for all analyses.   \n \nRESULTS \nFigure 1 shows the CONSORT trial flow chart. Intervention group and control group \nwere similar with regard to age (mean(SD)intervention= 12.19 (1.1); mean(SD)control= 12.05 \nTheory-based Intervention to enhance Physical Activity Among Adolescents - 11 - \n(0.9)), height (mean(SD)intervention= 1.49 m (0.1); mean(SD)control= 1.50 m (0.1)), weight \n(mean(SD)intervention= 42.5 kg  (9.5); mean(SD)control= 44.8 kg (9.5)), gender (47% male in the \nintervention and 48% in the control group) and grade (65% in grade 6 in both groups). \nStudents who dropped out were mostly 6th graders who changed to different schools as the \nnew school year started between Time 3 and Time 4 and could not be followed up. Attrition \nwas unrelated to the intervention and not biased with regard to social-cognitive or behavioural \nbaseline measures.   \nEstimation of effects  \nTable 3a shows the point estimates and confidence intervals for PA in the intervention \nand control groups. At post-test, adolescents in the intervention group report an average of 18 \nminutes per week more of moderate and vigorous PA than adolescents in the control group \n(CL: -10- 46, ns). This difference increases to 33 minutes per week at 3-month follow-up and \napproaches significance (CL: -4- 71; p=.08). At the 9-month follow-up, the difference has \nincreased to a highly significant difference of 57 minutes per week between both groups (CL: \n13-101, p<.01).  \nThe random effects regression analyses show that baseline PA (T2: B=.33; SE=.04; \np<.001; T3: B=.41; SE=.06; p<.001; T4: B=.27; SE=.05; p<.001) and sex (T2: B=52.5; \nSE=14.6; p<.001) both account for significant amounts of variance in PA, while age does not \ncontribute to the equation. The intervention only reaches significance at Time 4 (T2: B=18.1; \nSE=14.2; p=.20; T3: B=33.4; SE=19.2; p=.08; T4: B=57.2; SE=22.5; p=.01). These models \naccount for 24.9% of the variance at Time 2; 29.8% at Time 3 and 36.9% at Time 4.  \nThe sensitivity analysis in Table 3b confirms the findings of the complete case \nintention to treat analysis. While imputing pre-intervention baseline data for missing values \nnaturally decreases the point estimates of effects, the sensitivity analysis confirms the \nsignificant group differences at Time 4 and the trend approaching significance at Time 3. The \nTheory-based Intervention to enhance Physical Activity Among Adolescents - 12 - \nintervention seems to facilitate PA with a cumulative effect over nine months following the \nintervention resulting in a difference of nearly one hour a week at the end of the trial.  \nProcess evaluation \nIntervention-effects on theoretical target variables are shown in Table 4.  Participants \nin the intervention group showed significantly higher increases in situation outcome \nexpectancies and coping planning than controls, i.e., they became more aware that their \ncurrent levels of physical activity might not be sufficient to achieve positive outcomes and \ndeveloped clearer plans about how to deal with barriers for regular PA. Trends for self-\nefficacy and action planning favour the intervention group but remain insignificant. Small and \ninsignificant trends favouring the control group were found for action outcome expectancies \nand intentions. The intervention overall seems to enhance behaviour-related cognitions for \nphysical activity. However, there is no evidence that the effect of the intervention on \nbehaviour is mediated by effects on cognitions as there is no significant group effect on \nbehaviour at Time 2 (Baron, & Kenny, 1986). Explorative analyses of a possible time-lagged \nmediation of Time 4 effects on behaviour through more immediate Time 2 effects of \ncognitions found no evidence for mediation.   \n \nDISCUSSION \nWe introduced a classroom-based intervention to increase levels of moderate and \nvigorous physical activity in adolescents. The intervention was based on social cognitive \ntheory and self-regulation theory and incorporates action planning and coping planning. This \nis the first report to use a formal taxonomy of behaviour change techniques (Abraham & \nMichie, in press) to describe a new intervention, which is also available as full intervention \nmanual (McIntyre & Ara\u00fajo-Soares, 2002). The intervention was found to be acceptable and \nfeasible for delivery by a school psychologist and a physical education teacher.  \nTheory-based Intervention to enhance Physical Activity Among Adolescents - 13 - \nTwo classes matched on socio-economic variables from each of 8 schools were \nrandomly assigned to receive the programme or to a usual-education control condition. The \nsample size was determined by opportunity and availability rather than by formal power \nanalysis. Findings need to be interpreted with this in mind, as type two errors, (failure to \ndetect existing group differences) are more likely. Random effects multilevel modelling \nshowed that the estimated differences in changes of physical activity between both groups \nincreased over time from 18 minutes a week post intervention, to 33 minutes a week three \nmonths later and 57 minutes per week nine months following intervention. The key purpose \nof the analysis was to gain a point estimation of the possible effect. However, the difference at \nthe 9-months follow-up is highly significant and the difference at the 3-months follow-up \napproaches statistical significance. Moreover, the point estimates compare to results of much \nmore intensive school-based interventions (e.g., Haerens et al., 2006). Conservative \nsensitivity analyses confirmed the general pattern of findings while naturally resulting in \nslightly lower effect size estimates. \nThe clinical significance of one hour more of moderate to vigorous physical activity \nper week might be modest (Rizzo et al., 2006). However, there is a growing body of evidence \nshowing linear relationships between physical activity and health (Hallal et al, 2006). An \ninexpensive classroom-based intervention can potentially reach a large number of adolescents \nand produce tremendous health promotion effects if a moderate increase in PA can be \ndelivered to a large number of individuals. The intervention studied is of minimal intensity \n(two 90 minute sessions on physical activity) and thus potentially a highly economic means of \nhealth promotion in schools.  \nDifferences in PA between intervention group and control group increased over time. \nMost behavioural interventions show immediate effects that over time lack sustainability \n(Marcus et al., 2006; Biddle et al., 2004). The presented data indicate a trend over time \nsuggesting that the effects might become stronger with time. This may be due to group \nTheory-based Intervention to enhance Physical Activity Among Adolescents - 14 - \neffects, as the intervention might have changed group norms, creating a culture of mastery \nand collective self-efficacy (Bandura, 1997). Moreover, there is evidence that collaborative \nplanning interventions might be more effective than individual planning interventions \n(Prestwich et al., 2005). This could have resulted in a social environment reinforcing of \nphysical activity. Self-regulatory variables such as self-monitoring and coping planning have \nalso been shown to be important in the maintenance of behaviour change (Sniehotta, Scholz & \nSchwarzer, 2005) and might have enabled participants in the intervention group to develop \nthe skills to keep up regular physical activity. Moreover, seasonal effects might have \ncontributed. Baseline measures were taken in October\/November (autumn), post-tests in \nNovember\/December (winter), 3-months follow-up in March (spring and period for school \nexams) and the 9-months follow-up took place in September (end of summer vacations). \nThe underlying rational of a theory-based intervention is that behaviour change is \nachieved by modifying theory-based determinants of behaviour (Michie & Abraham, 2004). \nAlthough a formal mediation analysis was beyond the scope of this paper due to sample size \nand power considerations, pre-post changes in theoretical target variables were analysed to \ntest if the intervention reached its immediate targets (Table 4). Multilevel analyses indicated \nthat adolescents in the intervention classes perceived more negative outcomes associated with \ntheir current levels of physical activity (situation-outcome expectancies) and reported higher \nlevels of coping planning. Trends favouring the intervention group were not significant for \nself-efficacy and approached significance for action planning. While these findings suggest \nthat the interventions successfully changed the theory-based targets, a non-significant trend \nfor goal intentions in favour of the controls needs further investigation. All theoretical \nmeasures at Time 2 were significantly correlated with physical activity, further supporting the \nrational of targeting these variables in the intervention (Table 1). These findings are also in \nline with recent evidence that theory-based measures of cognitions mediate the effects of \ntheory-based interventions. In a recent study by Dishman et al. (2004) self-efficacy partly \nTheory-based Intervention to enhance Physical Activity Among Adolescents - 15 - \nmediated the effects of a comprehensive school-based physical-activity programme in girls \nwith a similar age to the students in this study. However, in this study, no evidence for \nmediation was found. More research is needed to understand the process of behaviour change \nin complex interventions (Kraemer, Wilson, & Fairburn, 2002).  \n While the SCT and SRT components of the programme \u201cit\u2019s your body \u2013 use it well\u201d \nwere grounded on compelling evidence in adolescents (Stone et al. 1998), the use of planning \ninterventions in adolescence is a novel component in the programme. The only health \npsychology study on implementation intentions in an adolescent sample was conducted on \nsmoking cessation (Higgins & Conner, 2004). This study failed to find beneficial effects of \nplanning because few subjects turned out to be smokers. Coping planning interventions had \nnot been applied to health behaviour in adolescents before (cf. Mischel & Patterson, 1978) but \nthere is some evidence that joint action planning and coping planning is predictive of changes \nin PA amongst adolescents (Ara\u00fajo-Soares et al., in press). The planning interventions were \nembedded in a broader strategy of preparing students for risk situations and giving them \nnecessary background information to act on their intentions in the face of impediments. The \npresent study shows that the intervention facilitated coping planning and slightly changed \nlevels of action planning. Both measures show significant correlations with physical activity \nand the question of mediation requires further research on planning and in children and \nadolescents. \nLimitations and future research \nThis study provided estimates and confidence intervals of the intervention effects on \nPA and theoretical mediators. A full, randomised controlled trial is needed to provide \nconclusive evidence for its effectiveness in changing behaviour and its cost-effectiveness as \nwell as for the process evaluation. This full trial will be informed by the findings of this study.  \nThere is some evidence that interventions including policy and environmental changes \ntogether with school-based programmes are more effective than school-based programmes \nTheory-based Intervention to enhance Physical Activity Among Adolescents - 16 - \nalone (Timperio, Salmon & Ball, 2004). This intervention mainly focused on individual and \nsocial determinants of physical activity and involved the families to support the intervention. \nThe distinction between individual and environmental determinants of behaviour is somewhat \nmisleading. SCT is an evidence-based theory about the interaction of individual and \nenvironmental factors and argues that the environment affects behaviour by constraining and \nchanging beliefs (Bandura, 1997). Environmental interventions such as providing facilities for \nphysical activity are likely to affect individual behaviour mediated through cognitions about \ncontrol and costs. As environments will change over the lifespan, the focus on individual and \nsocial determinants has an important rational. Individual and environmental interventions are \nnot contradictory approaches; they augment each other.  \nComparing matched control classes with intervention classes in the same schools \nmight have biased the findings due to interaction between adolescents for both classes. \nAlthough there is no evidence that casual interaction with individuals undergoing a behaviour \nchange intervention leads to sustainable behaviour change, future studies should randomise \nclasses between schools. If there was a bias in the present study, it would have been in favour \nof the null hypothesis (no group differences).  \nFuture research should incorporate objective measures of behaviour (e.g., \naccelerometry), as self-report measures for physical activity are potentially susceptible to bias \ndue to limitations in recall accuracy (Sallis & Saelens, 2000). The use of the \u2018last seven days\u2018 \nreference-period was chosen to circumvent biases in recall. Children from 10 years and above \nwere shown to be able to report physical activity accurately over this time period (Kohl, \nFulton & Caspersen, 2000). The IPAQ is amongst the best-studied self-report measures and \nvalidation studies indicate good reliability and acceptable validity with regard to \naccelerometer measures (Craig et al., 2003). Observational measures and the use of \nmonitoring devices can have strong demand characteristics which might affect self-\nTheory-based Intervention to enhance Physical Activity Among Adolescents - 17 - \nmonitoring. Since self-monitoring was one of the key components of our intervention, the use \nof retrospective self-report measures ensured the internal validity of the intervention trial.  \nIn conclusion, this study found significant effects of a theory based classroom-\ndelivered physical activity programme on self-reported physical activity 9 months following \nthe intervention. It provided some insight into possible mechanisms involved in behaviour \nchange. Further health promotion programmes should be systematically developed based on \ntheory and established behaviour change techniques to modify evidenced mediators of \nphysical activity. The present study emphasised the inclusion of volitional factors such as \nplanning and self-monitoring in an adolescent sample.   \nTheory-based Intervention to enhance Physical Activity Among Adolescents - 18 - \nREFERENCES \nAbraham, C. & Michie, S.
