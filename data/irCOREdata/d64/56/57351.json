Introduction \nThe aim of this assessment was to identify geological storage sites for all of Ireland with the potential to store the emissions of \nlarge scale CO2 point sources. The results of this study will feed into an economic assessment and risk assessment, with the final \naim of the project to have several CO2 sources to sink (storage) case studies. \n \nSedimentary basins often have suitable geology in which CO2 may be stored. Storage potential may exist in depleted oil and \ngas fields or saline aquifers. This study concentrated on the major sedimentary basins of Ireland onshore and offshore where \npotential geological formations in which CO2 could be stored (reservoirs) exist below 750 m and where suitable sealing \nformations are present.  \n \nFor each basin, data were collected and interpreted and the basin was assessed according to its geological characteristics and \navailable data. Carbon dioxide storage capacity was calculated in areas where sufficient data were available and potential CO2 \nstorage sites could be identified. The data available for each basin are highly variable in coverage, type, quality and source. To \nreflect this, each basin estimate was classified according to a techno-economic resource pyramid recommended by the Carbon \nSequestration Leadership Forum [1]. \n \n \n* Corresponding author.

Areas in which \nhydrocarbon exploration has taken place have the most available data. In basins where hydrocarbon exploration has been limited, \ndata is often very sparse and therefore, there is more uncertainty. In such locations it may not be possible to make any estimate of \npotential CO2 capacity. Sedimentary basins which fall into this category may still be suitable for CO2 storage but have an \nunknown or unquantified CO2 storage capacity. Similarly a large amount of data does not mean that particular basin will have \ngood potential storage sites, but more information is available to analyse and provide conclusions.  \n \n2. Methodology \nThe work was undertaken using a basin-by-basin approach to analyse the geology and its suitability to store CO2. Initial work \nfocused on assessing the data provided by CSA and identifying gaps. The latter were addressed by an extensive review of the \nliterature.  \n \nEach basin was examined in turn using digitised top depth structure maps (where available) in order to determine areas in \nwhich potential reservoir rocks exist below 750m. The geological structure maps were also used to identify closed structures, \nwhich may have the potential to store CO2. Well data and published information were used to identify the geological \ncharacteristics of the potential storage reservoirs and seals. These data were utilised to calculate CO2 storage capacity where \npossible.  \n2.1. Classification of storage capacity \nTwo main categories of issues complicate the assessment of CO2 storage capacity:  \n\uf0b7 questions about the economic or practical availability of storage capacity \n\uf0b7 difficulties caused by the lack, or sparsity of geological data and resources necessary to make realistic estimates of \nstorage capacity \nEstimates of the availability of many geological resources such as minerals and fossil fuels commonly divide them into at \nleast two categories: resources (accumulations of anything that is useful and accessible to mankind) and reserves (that part of a \nresource that is available for production now, by being economically recoverable under current technological conditions).  \n \nPotential CO2 storage space in geological formations can be considered as a resource because it is potentially useful to man. \nHowever, very little of it appears to be economically exploitable under current technological conditions and thus qualifying as a \nreserve. Incentives are required to make geological CO2 storage cost-effective, with the exception of some enhanced oil recovery \nprojects.  Hence some means of subdividing the resource is required. Bachu et al. [1] suggest classification into theoretical, \neffective, practical or matched capacity: \n \nTheoretical capacity represents the physical limit of what the geological system can accept. It assumes that the entire volume \nis assessable and utilized to its full capacity to store CO2 in the pore space at maximum saturation in formation fluids, or \nadsorbed at 100% saturation in the entire coal mass. This represents the maximum upper limit to a capacity estimate, however it \nis an unrealistic number, as in practice there will always be physical, technical, regulatory and economic limitations that prevent \nfull utilization of this storage capacity.  \n \nEffective capacity (previously realistic capacity) represents a subset of theoretical capacity and is obtained by applying a range \nof technical (geological and engineering) cut-off limits to a storage capacity estimate, including consideration of that part of the \ntheoretical storage capacity that can be physically accessed. This estimate usually changes with the acquisition of new data and \nknowledge. \n \nPractical capacity (or viable capacity) is that subset of effective capacity that is obtained by considering technical, legal and \nregulatory, infrastructure and general economic barriers to CO2 geological storage. As such, it is prone to rapid changes such as \ntechnology, policy, regulation and\/or economic change. The practical storage capacity corresponds to the reserves used in the \nenergy and mining industries.  \n \nMatched capacity is that subset of practical capacity that is obtained by detailed matching of large stationary CO2 sources with \ngeological sites that are adequate in terms of capacity, injectivity and supply rate. This capacity is at the top of the resource \npyramid and corresponds to the proved marketable reserves used by the mining industry. The main difference between matched \nand practical storage capacity represents \u2018stranded storage capacity\u2019 that cannot be realised because of lack of infrastructure \nand\/or CO2 sources within an economic distance. \n \nBachu et al.[1] also recommend that all estimates of geological CO2 storage capacity should (a) clearly state the limitations \nthat existed (data, time, knowledge) at the time the assessment was made and (b) indicate the purpose and future use to which the \n Author name \/ Energy Procedia 00 (2010) 000\u2013000 3 \nestimates should be applied. Assessments that lack documentation of constraints (or justification for their use) cannot be easily \ncompared with other assessments. \n \nThis is the approach that has been followed to classify the types of capacity estimates calculated in this study. \n3. Potential storage sites \n \nFigure 1 All-island Ireland sedimentary basins examined for this study \nThe basins assessed are shown in Figure 1. For each basin or hydrocarbon prospect assessed the storage capacity estimate is \nlisted in Table 1. The storage capacity of all the sedimentary basins was assessed for both the onshore and offshore areas. Oil and \ngas fields and prospects were considered along with saline aquifer structures. Storage in caverns has not been calculated as they \nare too small to store the volumes of CO2 captured from point sources.  \n3.1. Oil and Gas prospects \nThe East Irish Sea Basin (EISB) hydrocarbon fields all have reservoirs in the Ormskirk Sandstone Formation, which is of \nTriassic age and forms the uppermost part of the Sherwood Sandstone Group. Most of the hydrocarbon accumulations are in \nhorsts or tilted fault blocks. They are sealed by the overlying Mercia Mudstone Group, which contains thick units of halite (rock \nsalt) that provide an effective seal. The two largest fields, South Morecambe and North Morecambe are depletion drive fields. \nTotal EISB storage capacity is estimated at 1034 Gt CO2, of which 734 Mt (70%) is in the South Morecambe field and 139 Mt \n(13%) is in the North Morecambe field [3]. \n \nIn the Celtic Sea Basin the main reservoir rocks lie within the Lower Cretaceous Greensands, with the Gault providing the \nseal. Hydrocarbons have been discovered in the \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 Sands of the Greensand Group and Upper Wealden in the Kinsale \n4 Author name \/ Energy Procedia 00 (2010) 000\u2013000 \nHead, SW Kinsale, Ballycotton and Seven Heads gas fields. Other units with significant reservoir potential include an Upper \nJurassic sandstone of Oxfordian-Early Kimmeridgian age and Liassic sandstone of Sinemurian age. Capacity estimates were only \npossible for Kinsale Head and Southwest Kinsale due to availability of data; these have been calculated at 330.9 Mt and 5.5 Mt \nrespectively. \n \nProspects in the Porcupine Basin have been identified in Jurassic and Cretaceous reservoirs; there is limited data for the \nBurren and Connemara oil fields therefore storage capacities for these fields could not be calculated.  However the storage \ncapacity for the Spanish Point field which has accumulations in the Jurassic Voligian Sandstones has been estimated at 115 Mt. \n \nThe Corrib gas field in the Slyne Basin has a Triassic fluvial sandstone reservoir (Sherwood Sandstone Group). The trap is a \nfaulted NE-SW trending anticlinal structure, which retains a gas column of 310 m and is sealed by Triassic evaporites of the \nMercia Mudstone Group. Total reserves in the fields are estimated to be 28.3 BCM (approximately 70% of Kinsale Head), \nhowever there is not enough data to provide a storage capacity estimate for this field. \n3.2. Aquifers \nThe majority of Ireland\u2019s CO2 storage capacity is in offshore and onshore saline aquifers. The Permo-Triassic basins located \ndown the eastern flank of Ireland offer the most quantifiable CO2 storage capacity for saline aquifers due to the data available \nfrom hydrocarbon exploration. The Triassic Sherwood Sandstone Group (including the Ormskirk Sandstone Formation) reservoir \nwith a Mercia Mudstone seal is a prolific hydrocarbon reservoir in the East Irish Sea Basin. This reservoir-seal pair is present in \nseveral other Permo\u2013Triassic Basins including the offshore Kish Bank, Central Irish Sea, Portpatrick and Peel Basins. Offshore \nthe total effective storage capacity of the closed structures in the Kish Bank Basin, Portpatrick and Central Irish Sea Basins \ncombined is 937 Mt. \n \nOnshore prospective basins include the Larne, Lough Neagh and Rathlin Basins. Data and resources were not available to \ncalculate the storage capacity of the Sherwood Sandstone Group for the onshore basins. In some areas the Sherwood Sandstone \nGroup is not at sufficient depth for CO2 storage. The Permian Enler Group offers some saline aquifer storage potential in the \nLarne and Lough Neagh Basins. Data were only available to calculate effective storage capacity for two identified closures in the \nLough Beg area of the Lough Neagh Basin. The calculated combined effective storage capacity of the two closures is 1940 Mt. \nSufficient data were only available to calculate the theoretical storage capacity of one other onshore sedimentary basin; the \nNorthwest Carboniferous Basin. There are several potential reservoirs in the Carboniferous sediments of the basin, including the \nDowra Sandstone Formation. The theoretical total basin storage capacity of the Dowra Sandstone formation has been calculated \nat 730 Mt. An important caveat is that this storage capacity may not be accessible due to expected difficulties injecting CO2 into \na tight gas reservoir.  \n \nFurther saline aquifer potential may exist offshore in the Celtic Sea in the Cretaceous \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 Sands and the Jurassic \nSinemurian Sandstone. Large but unquantified potential may exist in the Clare, Slyne, Erris, Porcupine and Rockall Basins.  \n3.3. Storage Capacity \nStorage capacities have been calculated for basins and hydrocarbon prospects where sufficient data is available, the methods \nfor calculating these estimates are explained in appendix A. These storage capacities have been classified according to the CSLF \nresource pyramid and are summarised in Table 1. \n \n \nTable 1 Basins and the estimated storage capacity and storage capacity classification \nBasin\/hydrocarbon prospect Capacity classification Quantified storage \ncapacity Mt \n \nKinsale Gas Field Practical 330 \nSouth West Kinsale Gas Field Practical 5 \nSpanish Point Gas field Practical 120 \nEast Irish Sea oil and Gas fields Practical 1,050 \nPortpatrick Basin Sherwood Sandstone selected \nstructures \nEffective 37 \nCentral Irish Sea Sherwood Sandstone structures Effective 630 \nLough Neagh Basin Enler Group selected structures Effective 1940 \nEast Irish Sea Basin Ormskirk structures Effective 630 \nKish Bank Basin Sherwood sandstone structures Effective 270 \nCeltic Sea - 1 structure in the Cretaceous A sand Theoretical 40 \n Author name \/ Energy Procedia 00 (2010) 000\u2013000 5 \nPortpatrick Basin\/ Larne whole basin Theoretical 2,700 \nPeel Basin Sherwood Sandstone whole basin Theoretical 68,000 \nNorthwest Carboniferous Dowra Basin whole basin Theoretical 730 \nCentral Irish Sea whole basin Theoretical 17,300 \nKish Bank Basin Carboniferous sandstone and coal Theoretical \/ un-quantified  \nRathlin Basin Sherwood Sandstone, Permian and \nCarboniferous \nTheoretical \/ un-quantified  \nCeltic Sea Cretaceous A sand Theoretical \/ un-quantified  \nPorcupine Basin Theoretical \/ un-quantified  \nSlyne\/Erris Basins Theoretical \/ un-quantified  \nClare Basin Theoretical \/ un-quantified  \nRockall Trough Theoretical \/ un-quantified  \nGas prospects Theoretical \/ un-quantified  \nOther onshore basins Theoretical \/ un-quantified  \nTotal storage capacity (million tonnes CO2) 93,782 \n \n4. Economic analysis of carbon capture and storage \nAn assessment of the technologies and costs involved in building a complete carbon capture and storage (CCS) chain was \ncarried out using internationally accepted methodology and taking into account the recommended approach by the International \nEnergy Agency (IEA). The following case studies where CO2 is captured from both IGCC and pulverised coal power plants were \nanalysed: \n1. Moneypoint power station to Kinsale Head gas field \n2. Cork power station to Kinsale Head gas field \n3. Kilroot power station to Portpatrick Basin \nThe costs of CCS have been estimated at \u20ac28 to over \u20ac56 per tonne CO2 avoided, and are highly dependent on the source of \nCO2 and the conditions and location of the storage reservoirs. The costs of CCS for IGCC power plants are approximately \u20ac15 \nper tonne less than that of pulverised coal power plants. \nThe study is a preliminary analysis based on limited process and cost data. Rules of thumb and simple equations were used to \nmodel the cases and detailed process or reservoir simulations were not carried out.  \n5. FEP analysis \nBased on the case studies in the economic analysis of CCS, a FEP analysis was carried out for the Kinsale Head gas field and \nfor the Larne\/Portpatrick basins. \n5.1. Kinsale Head field \nThe Kinsale Head gas field poses an attractive option for gas storage. Capacity is more than adequate and injectivity, \nconstrained by gas production performance, appears to be satisfactory at expected injection rates. The field is quite shallow \nhowever and because of this careful attention should be paid to the possible containment risks. The geological seals, in intact \nform, appear to be satisfactory, but the possibility of their recent modification during pressure depletion should be evaluated. As \na small number of faults cut the top of the reservoir and are perceived to present significant containment risks, fault geometry, \nlinkage and sealing properties should be evaluated. Wells pose the clearest containment risk, and a suitable risk management, \nmonitoring and remediation strategy must be developed. \n5.2. Larne Basin\/Portpatrick Basin \nThe Larne Basin may have some theoretical CO2 storage potential, but major risks include the shallow depth of the Sherwood \nSandstone across the basin, the possible lack of suitable closed structures and possible interference of injected CO2 with potential \npotable water supplies. In addition, key monitoring datasets (4D seismic) may be severely compromised by geological \nconditions. Further major data acquisition and analysis would have to be undertaken to reduce uncertainty before onshore storage \ncould be contemplated.  \n  \nOn the basis of currently available data in the Portpatrick Basin closed structures filled in the Sherwood Sandstone Group may \nhave potential theoretical storage capacity, but economic storage is likely to be limited by the restricted dimensions of the \n6 Author name \/ Energy Procedia 00 (2010) 000\u2013000 \nstructures. The Mercia Mudstone caprock, where intact, is likely to form an effective seal to stored CO2. If injectivity can be \nsuccessfully demonstrated, CO2 storage may be viable. Individual storage sites in the basin would have to be studied more \nclosely via a detailed site characterisation, with particular reference to fault seal capacity and injectivity.  \n6. Conclusions \nIreland has a good potential to store its point source CO2 emissions in geological formations in its sedimentary basins. The \ngreatest potential exists offshore in saline aquifer formations. The most accessible geological storage may be in the depleted gas \nfields of the Kinsale gas field in the Celtic Sea Basin, where geological conditions are well understood. The field could \npotentially store 330 Mt of CO2 and is nearing the end of its producing lifetime offering a window of opportunity for CO2 storage \nbefore infrastructure is removed. The offshore Permo-Triassic basins of the eastern shore of the Ireland have a similar geological \nexpression as the prolific hydrocarbon basin of the East Irish Sea. These basins could potentially store up to 937 Mt in identified \nclosed structures. The hydrocarbon prospective areas of Slyne, Erris, Porcupine, Clare and Rockall basins potentially offer a \nlarge CO2 storage capacity in their saline aquifers but due to a lack of data this is an un-quantified resource. The Celtic Sea which \nis the location of the Kinsale gas complex may also offer saline aquifer storage in the Cretaceous \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 Sands reservoir. \nOnshore the Northwest Carboniferous Basin has a total basin storage capacity of 730 Mt in the Dowra formation. To access the \npotential in the Dowra formation may be technically challenging due to the low permeability of this tight gas reservoir. Storage \nof CO2 in the East Irish Sea basin may offer the potential to store large amounts of CO2 in its oil and gas fields (1050 Mt) and \nallow access of the storage potential of the Ormskirk Sandstone Formation (630 Mt).  \n \nSome risks to CO2 stored in these locations have been identified in this study and should be fully assessed before considering \nCO2 storage. Kinsale Head poses some potential containment risks e.g. modification of the geological seal, leakage from wells. \nIn the Larne and Portpatrick basins the risks include shallow reservoir depths and structure limitations.  Basins should not be \ndisqualified purely on the basis of a perceived geological risk. It is fair to conclude that CCS will only be permitted where the \nenvironmental integrity can be assured before, during and after injection. \n \nThe costs of CCS have been estimated at \u20ac28 to over \u20ac56 per tonne CO2 avoided, and are highly dependent on the source of \nCO2 and the conditions and location of the storage reservoirs. The costs of CCS for IGCC power plants are approximately \u20ac15 \nper tonne less than that of pulverised coal power plants. \n \nThe estimated storage capacities in this study have been classified according to the CSLF methodology of a techno-economic \nresource pyramid. The total quantified (total theoretical CO2 storage capacity) but unproven CO2 storage capacity of the Island of \nIreland is approximately 94000 Mt. \n \n7.

Gas Fields \n \nThe methodology used to estimate the storage capacity of the gas fields is based on the principle that a variable proportion of \nthe pore space occupied by the recoverable reserves will be available for CO2 storage, depending mainly on the reservoir drive \nmechanism [4]. The mass of CO2 that would occupy the pore space in each field formerly occupied by its recoverable reserves of \nnatural gas is calculated according to the following formula: \n \nMCO2 = (VGAS (stp) \/ Bg). \u03c1CO2  (Equation 1) \n \nWhere: \nMCO2 = CO2 storage capacity (106 tonnes) \nStp = standard temperature and pressure  \nVGAS (stp) = volume of ultimately recoverable gas at stp (109 m3) \nBg = gas expansion factor (from reservoir conditions to stp) \n\u03c1CO2 = density of CO2 at reservoir conditions (kg m-3) \nThe density of CO2 at reservoir conditions was calculated from an equation-of-state [5]. \n \nThe above figure should be reduced (discounted) to allow for factors that may reduce the amount of pore space in the \nreservoir that could be filled with CO2. Water invasion into the reservoir during (and after) gas production is considered to be the \nmain factor that will affect the amount of CO2 that can be injected back into the gas field.  This can most accurately be estimated \nby numerical reservoir simulation. Unfortunately, no reservoir simulations were available for this study, so the following \nempirical factors were used to discount the CO2 storage capacity calculated in Equation 1: \n \n1. In gas fields with depletion drive, i.e. those where, during production the pressure in the gas field simply decreases as it \nwould if the gas were being produced from a pressurised sealed tank, it is assumed that 90% of the pore space could be \noccupied by CO2.  \n2. In gas fields with water drive, i.e. those where water encroaches into the pore space formerly occupied by the produced \nnatural gas, it is assumed that 65% of the pore space could be occupied by CO2. \n3. In gas fields where weak water drive or water drive in one or more compartments of a field has been observed it has \nbeen assumed that 65% of the pore space could be occupied by CO2. \n \nIn the absence of any specific data, the discounts used are similar to those used by Bachu & Shaw [4] in their study of the CO2 \nstorage capacity of the oil and gas fields of Alberta.  \n7.1.2. Aquifers \n \nCO2 storage capacity (tonnes) = 1total pore volume x 2density of CO2 x 0.43 (Equation 2) \n \n1 As water has to be displaced from the pore space in aquifers, and the reservoir is heterogeneous, much of the pore space can be \nbypassed by migrating CO2 when it is injected into such structures as it follows the path of least resistance. This results in a less \nthan perfect sweep of CO2 through the pore space and relatively low CO2 saturation of the reservoir rock. Based on reservoir \nsimulation of closed structures in the Bunter sandstone (Obdam et al. 2003), it is expected that the maximum regional CO2 \nsaturation of the pore space that could be achieved is approximately 40%. \n \n2 Calculated from experimental equations of state (Eric Lindeberg pers comm.) \n \n3 Calculated using the gross rock volume (thickness and area), multiplied by the net to gross ratio (where available) multiplied by \nthe average porosity.  \n \nThis method does not take into account the adverse pressure effects of injecting into low permeability reservoirs.  \n"}
