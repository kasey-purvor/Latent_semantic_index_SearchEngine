However, volumetric lava flux (or flow rate) is a 41 \ndifficult parameter to measure accurately in the field, and on Etna, the problems are compounded 42 \nby changes in flux that have been previously reported over a wide range of timescales [Neal and 43 \nDecker, 1983; Frazzetta and Romano, 1984; Guest et al., 1987; Harris et al., 2000; Calvari et 44 \nal., 2002; Lautze et al., 2004; Bailey et al., 2006].  An example of short-term variations is given 45 \nby Lautze et al. [2004], who report observations of unsteady flow in a proximal lava channel on 46 \nEtna in 2001, characterised by 10 \u2013 30 minute surges, interspersed between 1 \u2013 3 hours of 47 \nwaning flow. Flux changes have also been observed on other volcanoes such as Arenal [Wadge 48 \net al., 2006] and Mauna Loa [Lipman and Banks, 1987]. 49 \nAlthough the importance of flux magnitude is clear in lava flow models, and relatively 50 \nlong-term flux changes have been incorporated [Crisci et al., 2003; Hidaka et al., 2005], the 51 \ninfluence of this type of rapid change is not yet known. In order to improve flow models, a 52 \ngreater understanding of flux variations and their causes is required.  Ground-based imaging 53 \nusing affordable digital cameras and thermal imagers now offers the opportunity to provide 54 \nsignificant volumes of data for flow analysis. Here, oblique photogrammetric and computer 55 \nvision techniques are employed to quantify advance rates, channel flow thickness and widths and 56 \nsimilar data for flow-fronts, in distal regions of 'a'\u0101 lava flows on Mount Etna, Sicily. 57 \nLava flux estimates are generally made either by relatively direct point measurement of 58 \nparameters such as flow velocity [e.g. Guest et al., 1987; Lipman and Banks, 1987; Calvari et 59 \n 4\nal., 2002], by differencing sequential topographic fields of the area being analysed [e.g. 60 \nMacfarlane et al., 2006; Wadge et al., 2006] or by thermal flux techniques [Harris et al., 1998; 61 \nHarris et al., 2000; Harris et al., 2005]. The choice of method depends on the rate and area of 62 \nchange and the measurement frequency required. Space-based techniques or airborne imagery 63 \nusually cover wide areas, but are relatively infrequently carried out as determined by overflights 64 \nand cloud conditions. Hence, average flux values over intervals of days to years, are calculated 65 \nfrom these datasets, providing useful insights into the overall behaviour of a volcano, but 66 \nproviding few constraints for flow models. In order to acquire significantly more frequent 67 \nmeasurements, practicalities dictate that ground-based (and therefore usually close-range) 68 \nmethods are used. However, spatially extended ground-based surveys are generally slow and 69 \nconsequently point measurements of flux proxies (such as lava channel depth or velocity) are 70 \nused where changes are of a sufficient magnitude to measure. To date, sufficiently frequent 71 \nmeasurements to detect rapid changes in flux have been restricted to relatively fast flowing lava 72 \nchannels [e.g. Guest et al., 1987; Lipman and Banks, 1987; Bailey et al., 2006] and have not 73 \nrecorded flux variations within slower evolving regions of lava flow-fields. 74 \nAirborne laser scanners have been used to collect detailed topographic data on volcanoes 75 \n[Mazzarini et al., 2005]; however their deployment is expensive and they cannot image through 76 \ncondensing volcanic gases or cloud. Ground-based versions [Hunter et al., 2003] are difficult to 77 \ntransport to relatively inaccessible areas and can take a significant time to acquire a large scan, 78 \nlimiting their use on evolving scenes. Oblique photogrammetric techniques [Chandler et al., 79 \n2002; Cecchi et al., 2003; James et al., 2006] are significantly less expensive, easier to deploy to 80 \nrelatively inaccessible areas and, with careful data analysis, can produce frequent, but relatively 81 \nspatially extended, volume change data for flux measurement. In the surveys described below, 82 \nfluxes < 1 m3s-1 were measured over spatial dimensions of order 100 m, at repeat intervals of 83 \ntens of minutes to hours.  84 \n 5\nThe data presented here were collected in September 2004 from 'a'\u0101 flows on Mount 85 \nEtna, Sicily. The lava flux changes measured correlate with field observations of unsteady flow 86 \nbehaviour which was responsible for levee building and breaching, and was hence significant in 87 \nthe evolution of the flow field. Such variations represent an important process which ultimately 88 \nshould be incorporated into numerical flow models. 89 \n 90 \n2 Eruption setting 91 \nThe 2004-2005 eruption of Etna started on 7 September, on the lower eastern flank of the South 92 \nEast Cone, and continued until 8 March at an average extrusion rate of ~3 m3s-1 [Burton et al., 93 \n2005]. At the time of fieldwork, lava was being erupted from two vents in the headwall of the 94 \nValle del Bove (Figure 1). 'A'\u0101 flow-fronts from the northerly, higher vent had reached the valley 95 \nfloor south of Monte Centenari and were stopping close to the break in slope. Over the period of 96 \nmeasurement, the flow-fronts observed were fed by the main channel from the northern vent, 97 \nwhich descended the headwall (an average slope of 22\u00b0) in an easterly direction before turning 98 \nsouth ~300 m from the active fronts. Breakouts to the northern side of the channel and at higher 99 \naltitude could not be observed due to the local topography, but several were known to have 100 \noccurred from observations made from the summit of Monte Centenari on 30 September.   101 \nThe flow-front region was visited on 23 and 25 \u2013 30 September, 2004 but detailed 102 \nmeasurements were not possible on all days due to weather conditions. Over this period, a 103 \nsequence of 4 active flow-fronts were observed forming from breakouts successively higher up 104 \nthe channel system, which then descended the lower regions of the headwall, before stalling 105 \nwhen the local slope decreased to ~7\u00b0 on the floor of the Valle del Bove. 106 \nOn 23 September, a flow-front was advancing across the valley floor and was seen to be 107 \nactive only on that day. This flow provided the eastern boundary to subsequent flows and, by 25 108 \nSeptember, its feeder channel was observed to be ~80 % drained and inactive. On 26 September, 109 \n 6\nthe next flow-front had fully developed and was descending alongside the west levee of the 110 \nprevious flow. This, and the subsequent two flow-fronts, were imaged and mapped over the next 111 \nthree days (Figures 2 and 3).  112 \nOn 27 September (Figure 2b) the active flow-front of the previous day (designated as flow-113 \nfront 1) had reached the flatter ground and was advancing at ~3 m hr-1. Another breakout had 114 \noccurred and, after a section of bifurcated channel, the new flow (flow-front 2) had started to 115 \ndescend along the previous western levee. By 28 September this new flow-front was the 116 \ndominantly active one, although some minor advance of the previous flow-front was also 117 \ndetected (Figure 2c, note that the elevated temperatures in the thermal image suggest that flow-118 \nfront 1 was still significantly active at the time of imaging). By the next day, both flow-fronts 1 119 \nand 2 were inactive and a new flow-front (3) had descended and was advancing at ~4 m hr-1 120 \n(Figure 2d). Brief observations made on the 30 September confirmed that this flow-front had 121 \ntravelled further than its predecessors, and halted only when it reached a topographic rise ~4 \u2013 5 122 \nm high. 123 \nOver this period, the flows observed were typical blocky 'a'\u0101, ~7 m thick, 15 \u2013 70 m wide, 124 \nwith active fronts inclined at ~40\u00b0 to the horizontal. Flow-front advance was marked by rubble 125 \nfalling from the flow surface as well as periodic spalling from the flow-front, which temporarily 126 \nrevealed incandescent material. Ogives were visible in both channels where the flows traversed 127 \nthe shallow gradient of the valley floor, but were most pronounced in the channel feeding flow-128 \nfront 1.  129 \n 130 \n3 Imaging and Analyses 131 \nThermal and visible images of the active flow-fronts were collected during the fieldwork period, 132 \nand the images obtained on 27 \u2013 29 September were suitable for photogrammetric analysis and 133 \ntopographic reconstruction. Since the lavas descended a slope onto relatively flat terrain, images 134 \n 7\nacquired from in front of the flow-fronts also included some of the distal channel regions. 135 \nFortuitously, the local topography increased some distance away from the flow-fronts allowing 136 \nfurther images to be acquired from slightly higher vantage points, increasing the area of terrain, 137 \nand therefore of the flow\u2019s upper surface, which could be observed. The photogrammetric 138 \napproach and techniques used have been previously described in James et al. [2006] but have 139 \nsubsequently been improved for better topography extraction. The method uses images taken by 140 \na single camera which is moved around the region being studied, in this case, the lava flow-141 \nfronts. For a survey, multiple images are acquired and, as long as this is carried out significantly 142 \nfaster than the timescale of change within the region, accurate photogrammetric measurements 143 \ncan be achieved. Each survey constitutes calculation of a photogrammetric network (i.e. 144 \ncalculating camera orientations and refining control target positions) from multiple images 145 \n(typically 20 \u2013 30 images), in each of which a minimum of four points of known positions 146 \n(control targets) must be observable. Once this is achieved, topographic points are then 147 \ncalculated by image matching between a few relatively similar images within the network (Table 148 \n1), and a surface model is then constructed by interpolating the data onto a regular x-y grid. The 149 \ndistance between the camera positions of matched images is generally between 5 and 20 m, and 150 \nwas dependent on the scene being observed and the practicalities of moving over the local 151 \ntopography. 152 \nVisible images were taken using a 6 megapixel digital SLR camera (Canon EOS 300D) 153 \nwith a fixed focal length (28 mm) lens. For long distance images, a 50 mm lens was also 154 \nemployed. The imaging geometry of the camera and lenses had been pre-calibrated in the 155 \nlaboratory for photogrammetric use. Calibration confirmed that the photogrammetric imaging 156 \ngeometry of the camera was sufficiently well understood to deliver 3D coordinates with a 157 \nprecision of better than 1:60,000, a ratio representing the calculated 3D point precision with 158 \nrespect to the overall spatial extent of the photogrammetric coverage. In order to maintain the 159 \n 8\ncalibration, the mechanical focus adjustment of the lens was locked to provide sharp images over 160 \na ~5 m to infinity range at a lens aperture of f\/11. 161 \nSpatial control for the photogrammetric network was provided by aluminium foil control 162 \ntargets. Three control networks were deployed sequentially as the flows advanced; an initial 163 \nwide network of flat targets, ~40 cm across (spanning distances of up to ~200 m and originally 164 \ndesigned to support potential helicopter-borne imaging), a intermediate network comprising foil-165 \nwrapped rocks on local topographic highs (spanning distances of up to ~100 m), and the smallest 166 \nnetwork comprising foil balls, approximately 4 cm in diameter (spanning distances of up to ~30 167 \nm). All targets were deployed on static ground and once their positions had been measured they 168 \nwere deemed to be in fixed positions. The wide and intermediate networks were used on 27 and 169 \n28 September for imaging flow-fronts at distances of up to ~100 m. For increased accuracy when 170 \nimaging over shorter distances (~30 \u2013 50 m), these networks were augmented by the smallest 171 \nnetwork on 29 September.   172 \nTarget coordinates were obtained using GPS (a ProMarkX receiver, logging for a 173 \nminimum of 15 minutes at each site) with additionally, for the two smaller networks, target-to-174 \ntarget distances measured with a tape measure. Tape-measured distances between targets were 175 \ndeemed accurate to \u00b110 \u2013 20 mm depending on the line length. With both types of geometric 176 \nconstraint being incorporated into the photogrammetric projects, local accuracy and overall 177 \ngeoreferencing could be achieved. However, in this work, only relative registration of the 178 \ntopographic data was required, consequently absolute referencing accuracy has not been 179 \nassessed. Point precisions were centimetric in regions close to the camera, increasing to 180 \ndecimetric over the longer distances used. These precisions are significantly lower than those 181 \nachievable under optimal conditions and in the laboratory, but reflect some of the difficulties in 182 \nrapidly producing extended networks under field conditions. 183 \nTopographic data were obtained by using an iterative feature-based image patch 184 \nmatching routine [Papadaki, 2002] within the photogrammetric software (VMS 185 \n 9\n(www.geomsoft.com), Robson & Shortis). The photogrammetric output is in the form of a point 186 \ncloud (a 3D distribution of points) representing the positions of distinct features detected in the 187 \nimages. Outliers are initially removed by rejecting all 3D points with vertical precisions >0.5 m. 188 \nAny remaining outliers (resulting from incorrectly matched points) were easily observed and 189 \nmanually removed within an appropriate viewer. Point clouds are then interpolated into a regular 190 \nx-y grid to form a digital elevation model (DEM) for volumetric analysis. Two examples of such 191 \nsurface reconstructions are shown in Figure 4, an overview, covering the majority of the area 192 \nimaged (Figure 4a), and a second, higher resolution reconstruction (interpolated onto a 20 cm 193 \ngrid) covering a single flow-front (Figure 4d) for flux calculation. In Figure 4d, the flow-front 194 \ntopography is shaded by the magnitude of change since the previous survey. The sum of these 195 \nchanges was used to calculate flux, with regions of negative change being generally negligible. 196 \nFigure 4d shows a typical area (30 \u00d7 40 m) reconstructed for flow-front flux calculations on 29 197 \nSeptember, when the flow-front was relatively localised (Figure 3). Wider regions (up to ~70 m 198 \nacross) were used for 27 and 28 September due to the larger flow-fronts active on these days.  199 \nErrors in the final surface models arise from three sources, those propagating from 200 \nindividual point matches, systematic errors resulting from inaccuracies in the relative camera 201 \norientations (and also from the camera model, although relative to others, these are negligible) 202 \nand errors due to interpolation over data-poor areas. Of these, the first two are angular in nature 203 \nand consequently, DEM accuracy decreases with distance from the camera. Using ground-based 204 \nimagery for reconstructing surfaces of a braided riverbed, Chandler et al. [2002] were able to 205 \nproduce point precisions of <0.03 m over distances up to 280 m and the resulting DEMs had root 206 \nmean square errors of <0.05 m. This illustrates the potential of ground-based photogrammetric 207 \nmethods; however these accuracies were not achieved (nor required) in this work for several 208 \nreasons.  209 \nOn Etna, the topography was less favourable (Chandler et al. [2002] were able to observe 210 \nthe river bed from close and steep valley sides); the very oblique views on Etna meant that 211 \n 10\ncontrol targets were at a wide range of distances from the camera and could not be optimised (for 212 \nsize or position) from all camera positions. The advancing flows also obscured and overran 213 \ntargets, so some targets had to be located in places initially away from the flows (although many 214 \nwere lost by 30 September), rather than in optimal positions for photogrammetry. This also 215 \nmeant that a wide angle lens had to be used in order to include both the flows and surrounding 216 \ncontrol targets within images, effectively decreasing the imaging resolution of the flow areas. In 217 \norder to assess the repeatability of the surfaces produced, cross-sections through DEMs from 218 \nthree surveys on 27 September are shown in Figure 4b. The region of static ground shown was 219 \n~150 \u2013 200 m from the camera positions, and hence >50 m farther away than the flow-fronts. To 220 \nestimate error in any volumetric change calculated, the average magnitude of the mean offsets 221 \nbetween these sections has been calculated and is 0.16 m. Similar analysis for data collected on 222 \n29 September from closer positions (~25 m) shows a mean offset of 0.02 m. 223 \nFor thermal imaging, a tripod-mounted FLIR S40 was used and, on 27 September, 224 \nsynoptic views of the distal channel region and the active flow-fronts were recorded. Images 225 \nwere collected every second, but data continuity was broken during periods of obscuration by 226 \nlow cloud and heavy rain (during which the instrument was covered). Due to the limited spatial 227 \nresolution of the thermal camera, thermal images (320 \u00d7 240 pixels) were registered to the 228 \ntopographic data by incorporating a visible image taken from the same position into the 229 \nphotogrammetry network. The camera azimuth, pitch and roll could then be determined by 230 \nmatching features in the thermal and associated visible image. 231 \nA thermal image sequence was used to analyse the flow of lava down a distal channel in 232 \norder to assess flux and rheological properties. Although the thermal camera has a significantly 233 \nlower spatial resolution than most standard cameras, the high contrast in thermal images of 234 \nactive 'a'\u0101 lavas makes them ideal for monitoring the evolution of flow features. The detection 235 \nand tracking of change within an image sequence is a common computer vision problem and a 236 \nLucas-Kanade \u2018optical flow\u2019 technique [Horn and Schunck, 1981; Lucas and Kanade, 1981; 237 \n 11\nDavies, 2005] was used to follow motion in image sequences. In this, for each sequential image 238 \npair, a displacement map is sought which references the pixels of one image to corresponding 239 \nareas in the other, in order to minimise pixel intensity changes between the images. This 240 \nessentially \u2018tracks\u2019 intensity values which, for the application here, describes the motion of the 241 \nflow surface. 242 \n 243 \n4 Observations and flux measurements  244 \n4.1 Flux pulses in channels 245 \nPulses of lava were observed descending the distal region of the main channel on each day, with 246 \nup to three being seen over the longest observation period (~9 hrs). In Figure 5, a sequence of 247 \nthermal images shows the progression of a pulse through the area of bifurcated channel on 27 248 \nSeptember. In the first panel (i), the relatively steady conditions prior to the arrival of the pulse 249 \nare illustrated. The increasing lava flux associated with a pulse is initially indicated by increasing 250 \napparent temperatures and an increase in the lava depth within the channel (panel (ii), just above 251 \nthe bifurcation). The pulse split as it flowed into the bifurcation (iii), and the effective increase in 252 \nchannel area slowed the advance of the pulse front. Additional fresh material continued to flow 253 \nin behind the front, inflating the flow surface (iv), sufficiently, in the flow-front 2 channel 254 \nbranch, to overtop the levees (v). In this channel, as the pulse front traversed a slightly shallower 255 \ngradient section (~20\u00b0, vi-viii) it was simultaneously growing in height and cascading rubble 256 \nover the levees, effectively levee-building as it progressed. At ~15:50 (viii) the pulse approached 257 \na steep (~30\u00b0) section of channel, accelerated rapidly and appeared to slump down the remaining 258 \nchannel (ix-x). Unfortunately, measurements had to be curtailed (in order to leave the area in 259 \ndaylight) before the effect of this pulse on the flow-front could be observed. 260 \nIn the channel feeding flow-front 1, overflows did not occur due to the wider and deeper 261 \nnature of the channel, but variations in channel depth are shown throughout the image sequence 262 \n 12\n(see Figure 6b). It is worth noting that similar distal flux variations were observed during the 263 \nPu'u '\u014c'\u014d-K\u016bpaianaha eruption on Hawai'i, for which Neal and Decker [1983] describe 40-264 \nminute \u2018surges\u2019 of high volume and high velocity flow which represented fluxes up to an order 265 \nof magnitude greater than those during \u2018inter-surge\u2019 periods (lasting 2 to 8 hours).  However, the 266 \nauthors are unaware of any detailed published data on the processes involved. 267 \n 268 \n4.2 Flow-front fluxes 269 \nEleven surface models were produced of the active flow-front regions observed between 27 and 270 \n29 September. Each model was the product of one photogrammetric survey (listed in Table 1), 271 \nand fluxes were calculated by subtracting the active flow-front regions of successive models. 272 \nThe resulting flux values (of up to 0.35 m3 s-1) are given in Figure 6a, where each thick 273 \nhorizontal line reflect the average flux between two surveys (carried out at the times denoted by 274 \nthe end points of the line). None of the three monitored flow-front regions exhibited a steady 275 \nevolution. Instead, the data suggest periods of both waxing and waning flux (Figure 6a) with, for 276 \nexample, flow-front 1 advancing at rates between 0.045 and 0.35 m3 s-1. 277 \nIn order to verify that these variations are real and not within measurement error, one can 278 \nconsider worst-case scenarios based on the measured mean surface offsets of 0.02 m (at ~25 m 279 \nfrom the camera positions) and 0.16 m (at ~175 m from the camera positions). For example, if a 280 \nsurvey carried out on 29 September (flow front 3, e.g. Figure 4d), was susceptible to a systematic 281 \nvertical error of ~0.05 m over a typical flow-front area of ~20 \u00d7 30 m, this would represent a 282 \nvolume error of \u00b130 m3. Thus, for a flow front advancing at ~0.2 m3 s-1, surface measurements 283 \ntaken approximately an hour apart would show a volumetric change of 720 \u00b1 30 m3, representing 284 \na calculated flux error of <5 %. In Figure 6a, the width of the grey error bars have been 285 \ncalculated from this approach, using appropriate spatial areas, and vertical offsets of 0.05 m for 286 \nthe relatively close flow-fronts observed on 29 September and 0.2 m for the more distant (~100 287 \n 13\nm) flow-fronts observed on the preceding days. For the overnight advance of flow-front 2, the 288 \ncomplete region was not fully captured in survey 28a (as demonstrated by the dashed bounding 289 \nline in Figure 3), so simple geometric extrapolation had to be used between parts of surveys 27c 290 \nand 28a. This has been accounted for in the error estimate by increasing the potential vertical 291 \noffset between these particular surfaces to 0.5 m. 292 \n Note that the flux measurement made between surveys 29b1 and 29b2  (carried out 5 293 \nminutes apart, Table 1) is associated with significant errors (\u00b150 %) due to the short duration 294 \nbetween the surveys but the calculated flux (0.23 m3 s-1) is in line with the previous and 295 \nfollowing flux values (0.19 and 0.22 m3 s-1, Figure 6a). Negligible net change was detected 296 \nbetween surveys 29c1\/2 and 29c3, suggesting that flow front 3 may have stopped. Although this 297 \nwas the last survey pair carried out, the flow was observed to have continued to advance when 298 \nvisited the next day. Unfortunately, the overnight advance (29 \u2013 30 September) overran the 299 \ncontrol targets deployed, so calculation of a final flux value was not possible. 300 \n 301 \n4.3 Channel fluxes and rheology 302 \nFor data from 27 September, the average flow-front flux values can be compared with channel 303 \nfill levels (as a proxy for lava flux) determined from the thermal image sequence (from which 304 \nexcerpts are shown in Figure 5). Figure 6b shows data from two points (labelled in Figure 5, 305 \npanel i) on the channels feeding both flow-fronts 1 and 2. For flow-front 1, the upstream channel 306 \npoint (1a) indicated height changes of ~5 m and the downstream point (1b) varied by less than 2 307 \nm. For the channel feeding flow-front 2, the smaller channel produced larger height changes, 308 \nwith over 7 m occurring as the pulse front passed. On both channels, the distance between the 309 \npoints chosen was ~50 m and, with a lag of approximately 30 minutes between the up- and 310 \ndownstream changes, this gives a descent rate of the pulses of ~1.6 m min-1. 311 \n 14\nFor the flow-front 2 channel, the favourable viewing geometry allowed the optical flow 312 \ntechnique to be applied to a sequence of thermal images collected over a 9-minute period (11:57 313 \n\u2013 12:06, 27 September) of relatively steady flow (Figure 7). The underlying channel topography 314 \n(including levees) was constrained by a survey carried out around 3 pm on 28 September (survey 315 \n28b, Table 1), under conditions of near complete channel drainage. For the period of the thermal 316 \nimage sequence, the location of the lava surface was determined by reprojecting the image 317 \nposition of the eastern edge of the flow onto the levee topography. With the western channel 318 \nmargin being much less distinct, the flow surface was then defined by planes which passed 319 \nthrough the defined points on the eastern flow edge and had dip directions parallel to the 320 \nchannel, i.e. they were horizontal across the channel (Figure 7a, inset). 321 \nThe average optical flow was calculated from 17 sequential image pairs taken at intervals 322 \nof 30 s around 12:00, 27 September. The resulting flow vectors (in image space) were then 323 \ntransformed into object space by reprojection onto the modelled flow surface (Figure 7b). In the 324 \nfigure, the edges of the channel are indicated by the regions of elevated apparent temperature, 325 \nindicative of the channel margin shear disrupting the relatively cool flow surface and exposing 326 \nhotter, deeper material. Note that velocity vectors of non-negligible magnitude are also present 327 \noutside of the channel region, suggesting motion of the levees. This is an artifact of optical flow 328 \nschemes, which use a smoothness constraint (e.g. minimising the square of the optical flow 329 \nvelocity gradient magnitude [Horn and Schunck, 1981]) to regularise the output displacement 330 \nfield in order to determine a unique optimum solution. A consequence of this is the blurring of 331 \nvelocities into areas of low intensity contrast and here, the channel velocities propagate into the 332 \n(stationary and lower-contrast) levee areas. This has the effect of the apparent widening of cross-333 \nchannel velocity profiles and inducing some asymmetry in the profiles, dependent on the image 334 \ncontrast in the levee regions (Figure 7c). Within the channel region, the velocity field has been 335 \nverified by integrating the individual optical flow results for each image pair in the sequence and 336 \nobserving that, with the exception of at the margins, the displacements produced follow the lava 337 \n 15\nsurface motion. Thus, although velocity profiles are distorted toward their edges, and hence are 338 \nnot used further here, velocity magnitudes for the central channel are believed to have been 339 \naccurately recovered. Imaging the channel more closely (or with the use of a narrower angle 340 \nlens) would have allowed significantly better velocity profiles to have been calculated because 341 \nthe edge effects would represent a smaller proportion of the channel width. 342 \nA rigorous error metric for the velocities is difficult to determine due to the number of 343 \ndifferent steps involved. However, estimates can be made to illustrate the appropriate 344 \nmagnitudes. For the points used in the channel topography, average coordinate precisions 345 \n(derived from the photogrammetry) are 0.07, 0.45 and 0.07 m in X, Y and Z respectively. The 346 \ndisproportionately large value in the Y direction is due to the optical axes for the images used 347 \nbeing close to that direction. Observing slopes inclined by up to 34\u00b0 along the Y direction could 348 \nincrease the error in the local Z values determined by 0.3 m. Hence, a conservative error of 0.5 m 349 \nin height could be used to incorporate uncertainties in the initial topography and the position of 350 \nthe lava surface. 351 \nIn order to estimate error in the movement vectors computed using optical flow for the 352 \nchannel region, the magnitude of vectors generated in areas of the image where the surface is 353 \nstationary can be considered. In making this analysis, areas of similar contrast variation to those 354 \nof interest should be used. Within the sequence investigated, the only such areas are the 355 \nrelatively small areas of warm levee observed. For 100 \u2018zero-velocity\u2019 vectors in the stationary 356 \nlevee area, the root mean square of the displacement magnitudes was 0.02 pixels. In the channel 357 \nregions, at the relevant distances and angles, the thermal image pixels reprojected onto the 358 \ntopography have footprints between 0.9 and 1.3 m in the down-channel direction. Hence, a 0.02 359 \npixel error represents ~0.02 m on the surface and, with images taken at 30 s intervals, this 360 \nimplies a 0.04 m min-1 error magnitude in velocities from the optical flow process. This increases 361 \nto 0.05 m min-1 if an estimated uncertainty of \u00b15\u00b0 in the local slope is included. 362 \n 16\n Given a number of assumptions, the flow velocity results can be used to estimate lava 363 \nflux and rheological properties. For the simplest approach the lava is assumed to be Newtonian 364 \nfluid, unimpeded by any surface crust, and flowing in a wide channel of rectangular cross 365 \nsection. For steady flow and a flow depth perpendicular to the flow surface, h, the Newtonian 366 \nviscosity, \u03b7N, can be calculated from the maximum surface velocity, vmax, by 367 \n 2\nmax\nN 2\nsin h\nv\ng \u03b1\u03c1\u03b7 =  1), 368 \nwhere \u03c1, \u03b1 and g are the fluid density, channel slope and gravitational acceleration respectively 369 \n[Dragoni et al., 1995]. Flux, QN, is given by 370 \n hwvQ max32N =  2), 371 \nwhere w, is the channel width. In Table 2, flux values have been calculated for three channel 372 \ncross sections (A, B and C, in Figure 7b), assuming constant values of \u03c1 = 2000 kg m-3 and g = 373 \n9.8 m s-2. The sensitivity of the results to errors in velocity and flow depth has been illustrated by 374 \nproviding minima and maxima bounds determined by 0.05 m min-1 and \u00b1 0.5 m variations in 375 \nvelocity and flow depth respectively. The results from sections B and C are in good agreement 376 \n(0.08 and 0.07 m3 s-1), but differ considerably from those obtained from section A (0.21 m3 s-1) 377 \nand an examination of the data indicates an apparent inconsistency. Comparison of the data from 378 \nA and B indicates that, for a similar gradient, lava in the deeper channel section (A) was flowing 379 \nslower than in the shallower one (B). Only in the case of significant changes in rheology, 380 \nchannel geometry or lava density could this be possible for steady flow under equilibrium 381 \nconditions. A more likely alternative is that at A, the flow was not at equilibrium and was 382 \naccelerating due the recent increase in the gradient, a case for which equation 1 is not valid. 383 \nHence, results from section A should be treated with caution.  384 \nHowever, lavas have been previously shown to be non-Newtonian in their behaviour, and 385 \nare often represented as Bingham fluids [Robson, 1967; Hulme, 1974; Pinkerton and Sparks, 386 \n1978]. Bingham models have been derived and discussed in detail elsewhere [Johnson, 1970; 387 \n 17\nDragoni et al., 1986; Dragoni et al., 1992], so we reproduce rather than re-derive the relevant 388 \nequations here. 389 \nFor a wide rectangular channel the maximum flow velocity, at which the plug-flow region 390 \ntravels, is 391 \n \u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b\n\u2212+= hK\ng\nKghv 2\nsin\nsin\n2\n1 22\nB\nmax \u03b1\u03c1\n\u03b1\u03c1\n\u03b7\n 3), 392 \nwhere \u03b7B is the Bingham viscosity and K is the shear strength. The thickness of the plug region, 393 \nTc, is given by 394 \n \n\u03b1\u03c1 sing\nKTc =  4). 395 \nEquation 3 is usually employed to find the Bingham viscosity, using measurements of the 396 \nmaximum flow velocity and independent measurements of shear strength [Lipman and Banks, 397 \n1987]. Here, we can use two sets of velocity, slope and height measurements to simultaneously 398 \nascertain \u03b7B and K. With K to the second power in equation 3, each pair of measurement sets 399 \nprovides two potential solutions of K and \u03b7B but, in order for a solution to be valid, it must also 400 \nsatisfy the constraint that the plug depth is smaller than the flow thickness (Tc < h). So, from 401 \nequation 4, solutions not satisfying 402 \n \u03b1\u03c1 singhK <  5), 403 \ncan be discarded. For valid values of K and \u03b7B, the Bingham fluid flux is given by 404 \n \u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b\n\u2212+= 2222\n3\n3\nB 3sin\nsin2\n6\nKh\ng\nKghwQ\nB \u03b1\u03c1\n\u03b1\u03c1\n\u03b7\n 6), 405 \nThree measurement sets have been obtained from the cross-sections A, B and C. However, 406 \ndue to the belief that at A, the flow is not in equilibrium, \u03b7B and K are calculated from 407 \nmeasurements at sections B and C only (Table 2). Note that volume conservation is not invoked 408 \nin solving equation 3, so independent flux measurements for both sections can be made using the 409 \n 18\nrheological parameters determined and these are similar to the values determined using the 410 \nNewtonian model (0.11 and 0.10 m3 s-1).  411 \nFor the channel feeding flow front 1, the highly oblique imaging geometry of the upper 412 \nchannel areas combined with extended range (Figure 5) can be expected to produce a relatively 413 \ninaccurate reprojection of the optical flow vectors onto the 3D surface model. Hence, velocities 414 \nhave not been calculated by this method; however, the undulose topography of the ogives in the 415 \nlower areas of the channel has allowed an alternative topographic measurement of velocity. The 416 \nmultiple local horizons produced (when observed at a shallow angle from the flow-front viewing 417 \nposition) make the ogive crests readily distinguishable in the topographic data (Figure 8). 418 \nIndividual crests can then be tracked between surveys using the thermal image sequences. 419 \nSurveys 27a and 27b reconstructed the most ogives during the survey period, and the 420 \naverage descent of their crests gives a flow velocity of 0.19 m min-1. With an average channel 421 \nwidth (from the photogrammetric data) of 19 m and an estimated flow depth of 3 m (the channel 422 \nwas never observed in a fully drained state), equation 2 gives a flux of 0.12 m3 s-1. If variations 423 \nand uncertainties in the lava depth are estimated to be covered by a range between 2 and 4 m, the 424 \ncorresponding calculated fluxes would be 0.08 \u2013 0.16 m3 s-1, similar to the values calculated for 425 \nthe flow-front 2 channel (Table 2). 426 \n 427 \n5 Discussion 428 \nClose-range photogrammetry and computer vision are established fields but the authors are not 429 \naware of previous application of the techniques for the measurement of lava flux. Consequently, 430 \nalthough most of the data collection problems encountered are well known (e.g. occlusion by 431 \nlocal topography or condensing gases) several specific analysis issues encountered are worth 432 \nhighlighting. 433 \n 19\nFor the 'a'\u0101 flow-fronts observed on Etna, with advance rates of a few metres per hour, 434 \nsmall scale local changes (e.g. spalling, a block falling or moving suddenly) were sufficiently 435 \nfrequent to influence DEM generation from images. Despite multiple images being usually taken 436 \nin rapid succession, subtle surface changes often resulted in patches of unmatchable image 437 \ntexture between non-sequentially acquired image pairs. Thus, whilst all relevant images could be 438 \nutilised within a photogrammetric bundle adjustment solution, in order to provide a common set 439 \nof camera orientations, image matching for topographic data extraction was often carried out 440 \nwith sequential image pairs. 441 \nIn some cases, problems were also introduced because of the presence of overhanging 442 \nblocks. Although such blocks were accurately depicted within point cloud data, overhanging 443 \nsurfaces cannot be represented by the standard interpolation of height (Z) values used in 444 \nmainstream digital terrain modelling software. A more sophisticated surface reconstruction 445 \napproach could have been employed (for example Marching Cubes [Lorensen and Cline, 1987]), 446 \nbut in view of the simplicity of height interpolation, its ease for volumetric analysis and the 447 \nrelative infrequency of overhanging surfaces, Z-interpolation was used. Consequently, 448 \n\u2018overhung\u2019 data points were manually removed from point clouds before interpolation. 449 \n5.1 Lava fluxes and rheology 450 \nThe lava flux feeding individual flow-front regions has been measured by three independent 451 \ntechniques; topographic change at the flow-fronts, thermal-intensity-derived channel velocities 452 \n(using optical flow) and topography-derived channel velocities (ogive velocities). Topographic 453 \nchanges of the flow-fronts provide averaged fluxes for the fronts over timescales of hours, with 454 \nvalues recorded between 0.35 and <0.05 m3 s-1. For the two active flow-fronts on 27 September, 455 \nthe total flux is <0.5 m3 s-1 which is considerably lower than the average effusion rate for the 456 \n2004-2005 eruption (3 m3 s-1, [Burton et al., 2005]). Furthermore, our own observations of near-457 \nvent fluxes (on 24 September) suggest that effusion rates for this channel during the period of 458 \n 20\nfieldwork may have been as high as 4 \u2013 5 m3 s-1, giving a large difference between the 459 \nvolumetric fluxes observed at the vent and at the flow-fronts. 460 \nFor the 'a'\u0101 flows from Mauna Loa in 1984, similar differences were noted with 461 \nvolumetric fluxes of 3.5 \u2013 5 \u00d7106 m3 hr-1 measured at the vent, having decreased by more than an 462 \norder of magnitude when measured 15 km down-channel [Lipman and Banks, 1987; Moore, 463 \n1987]. This decrease was attributed to volatile loss and was accompanied by a several-fold, 464 \ndown-flow increase in lava density (values ranged from ~300 to 2600 kg m-3 in samples collected 465 \nbetween the vent and 16 km down-flow [Lipman and Banks, 1987]). The same degassing process 466 \nwill also be a factor at Etna but to a lesser degree, and it is possible that other unmeasured flow-467 \nfronts were simultaneously active (such as the one shown in Figure 2d, 29 September). It is also 468 \nlikely that mass loss occurred gradually along the channel by levee-building and overtopping. 469 \nHence, we attribute these flux differences dominantly to steady down-channel mass-loss from 470 \nthe channel and to degassing. 471 \nIn this work, the optical flow method was applied to only a small number of channel 472 \nimages, and the results used to determine rheological parameters and channel flux. However, 473 \nwith the images used taken at a viewing distance of ~200 m and the channel covering only a 474 \nrelatively small number of pixels, there are undesirable geometric uncertainties and the optical 475 \nflow process deteriorates at the channel margins. Hence, although the value of lava shear 476 \nstrength obtained is in line with previous work on Etna [Pinkerton and Sparks, 1978], the 477 \nBingham viscosity value determined is associated with significant error. With the narrow range 478 \nof strain rates occurring, these measurement uncertainties must be reduced in order to increase 479 \nthe accuracy of the rheological calculations. However, this can be achieved by imaging closer to 480 \nthe appropriate flow region, which would also allow full velocity profiles to be accurately 481 \nmeasured and hence employed within the rheological and flux modelling. Furthermore, by 482 \nsimultaneously obtaining stereo visible imagery from which a continuously updated lava surface 483 \n 21\nmodel could be determined, these parameters could be monitored through time in a manner 484 \nsimilar to the channel level (Figure 6b) and this is a goal of future work. 485 \n 486 \n5.2 Flux variations 487 \nThe origin of the flux variations observed in the distal flow regions cannot be precisely 488 \ndetermined because it was impossible to simultaneously monitor the entire length of the active 489 \nchannel during the 2004-2005 eruption. However, three types of processes can be considered: 490 \n1) Periodic channel processes, such as up-flow levee breaching, or damming of the channel 491 \nby levee collapse.  492 \n2) Sub-surface processes, which result in variation of effusion rate at the vent. 493 \n3) Persistent channel processes, such as inherent flow instabilities. 494 \nAs a periodic channel process, levee breaching is a possible cause of rapid decreases in measured 495 \nflux, but not for relatively sudden increases in flux, such as pulses. Lava pulses of can be 496 \ngenerated by temporary damming of channels (e.g. by parts of collapsing levee walls, [Guest et 497 \nal., 1987; Bailey et al., 2006]), although this was not observed during time spent in the proximal 498 \nregions. Thus, in this particular case, it is not thought that periodic channel processes represent 499 \nthe driving mechanism for the distal flux variations measured. 500 \nObservations of the lava surface height made near the vent (~200 m down flow of the 501 \neffusive bocca, 24 September) revealed changes of up to ~0.5 m over time scales of ~30 minutes. 502 \nThese changes were very gradual and were thought to directly reflect variation of the effusion 503 \nrate in a manner similar to those observed at Etna in 2001 by Bailey et al. [2006]. For a simple 504 \nestimate of the lava volumes involved (neglecting evolving flow profiles and unknown 505 \nsubsurface channel geometry), using a maximum velocity of ~1 m s-1 and channel width of ~2 m, 506 \nthen an increase in flow depth of 0.5 m every alternate 15 minutes will represent an additional, 507 \n\u2018excess\u2019 flux of ~1200 m3 hr-1. 508 \n 22\nIn the distal region, the angle and distance to the main channel (up-slope of the bifurcation) 509 \nprevented photogrammetric measurement of pulses, so approximations of the dimensions 510 \ninvolved have been used in the absence of survey data. Assuming a channel width of ~10 m, a 511 \npulse length and height of ~15 \u00d7 5 m respectively, and a roughly triangular down-flow profile 512 \n(see Figure 2c), gives a volume of ~380 m3. Occurring on the 2 \u2013 4 hour timescale observed of 513 \nthe pulse events in the distal channel region, this represents an average \u2018pulse\u2019 flux of ~130 m3 514 \nhr-1. This is approximately an order of magnitude smaller than the \u2018excess\u2019 flux calculated for the 515 \nnear-vent region, a ratio which is in agreement with that calculated between the average fluxes at 516 \nthe vent and distal regions, as discussed in the previous section. Thus, the distal pulses observed 517 \ncould reflect near-vent fluctuations (possibly resulting from changes in effusion rate), but a 518 \nmechanism for effectively coalescing these fluctuations as they travel down-channel would have 519 \nto be invoked. 520 \nPersistent channel processes such as inherent flow instabilities represent such a possible 521 \nprocess. A scenario can be envisaged in which periods of increased flux generate portions of 522 \ndeeper channel flow which advance more rapidly and cool slower than material erupted during 523 \nperiods of shallower flow. Hence, larger pulses could catch up and \u2018collect\u2019 smaller pulses as 524 \nthey descend. Kinematic wave models of flows [Baloga and Pieri, 1986; Baloga, 1987] have 525 \nshown how the evidence of effusive behaviour at one time period can be overrun and buried by 526 \nsubsequent effusive behaviour. This modelling approach could be used to investigate fluxes, flux 527 \nchanges and the effect of non-linear rheologies on the generation of pulses in distal regions, but 528 \nfurther investigation is left to future work. 529 \n It is interesting to consider if the unsteady flow can be correlated to the production of the 530 \nobserved ogives, which appeared to start where the gradient decreased and the channel widened, 531 \nsupporting the importance of compressive forces in their formation. For a typical ogive in the 532 \nflow-front 1 channel, with a channel width of ~19 m, an along-channel distance of ~5 m and 533 \nexcess height of 2 m, excess volume is ~200 m3. With any distal pulse split at the channel 534 \n 23\nbifurcation, this is inline with one channel\u2019s portion of a 380 m3 pulse. Hence, it could be 535 \nsuggested that the ogives may have formed as the remnants of pulses, rather than by compressive 536 \nterminal processes alone. However, with the ogives moving at ~0.2 m s-1, and separated by ~15 537 \nm (Figure 8) they were being formed at a rate of one every hour and a half, approximately twice 538 \nthe rate of the distal pulses. Therefore, although it is difficult to see how flux changes could not 539 \ninfluence ogive formation in some manner, and despite individual volumetric similarity, a one-540 \nto-one ratio was not evident in the flows observed. 541 \n 542 \n6 Summary 543 \nClose-range photogrammetry and computer vision techniques have been demonstrated as useful 544 \ntools for investigating active 'a'\u0101 lava flows, with the use of image data allowing sufficiently 545 \nlarge spatial areas to be surveyed quickly and accurately. The flow-front regions observed on 546 \nEtna in September 2004 displayed significant variations in flux, resulting from flux variations in 547 \nthe distal channel regions which caused episodic draining and overflowing. Discrete pulses of 548 \nlava arriving in the distal flow regions were observed on timescales of several hours, and are 549 \nbelieved to represent the down-channel coalescence of flow regions erupted at slightly enhanced 550 \nfluxes. Average volumetric flux at the flow-front region was an order of magnitude smaller than 551 \nthat near the vent and this is attributed to mass loss over levees down the channel system, 552 \ncompounded by volatile loss from the lava. 553 \n554 \n 24\nAcknowledgements 554 \nThis work was supported by the Royal Society.

Lava flows at Mount Etna, Sicily in September 2004. The main figure shows the final 659 \nextent of the 2004-2005 flow-field in black and the inset gives the extent during the fieldwork 660 \nperiod. Marks around the southern flow-fronts provide the approximate location of some of the 661 \ncontrol targets deployed. Reproduced from James et al. [2006] with kind permission of Springer 662 \nScience and Business Media. 663 \n 664 \nFigure 2. Images of the channels and flow-fronts taken looking north from a distance of ~700 m. 665 \nIn (a) an image taken during a period of good visibility shows the two active flow-fronts (flow-666 \nfronts 1 and 2, with a total width of ~70 m) on 28 September. The northern wall of the Valle del 667 \nBove is seen in the far background, behind Monte Centenari. In (b-d) aligned thermal image 668 \ncomposites demonstrate the active flow-fronts (labelled 1 \u2013 3) on each day. The most eastern 669 \nflow, which is only just visible against the background (and is unlabelled), was observed being 670 \nemplaced on 23rd September. In (d) a new flow-front to the north can just be observed behind the 671 \nrecent flows, although its channel is obscured from view. 672 \n  673 \nFigure 3. Evolution of the observed flow-fronts as mapped from photogrammetry data. The 674 \nadvancing flow outlines are labelled corresponding to the survey IDs in Table 1. Dashed lines 675 \nrepresent inferred rather than observed locations. The positions of control targets are indicated 676 \nby black squares (wide network), blue circles (intermediate network) and red circles (small 677 \nnetwork). Several additional targets within the wide network were placed at locations further 678 \neast, outside the bounds of the figure. A selection of the camera positions used to produce the 679 \ntopographic data is indicated with green triangles. Their irregular distribution reflects the uneven 680 \nnature of the topography which prevented equal access over the entire area. 681 \n 682 \n 30\nFigure 4. Flow surface reconstructions. (a) An overview (27 September) covering the active 683 \nchannel and flow-front areas. Horizontal ticks are every 50 m and the vertical scale gives altitude 684 \nin metres. This overview covers a much wider area than those used to calculate flow-front fluxes 685 \n(e.g. (d)) and the darker, irregular region towards the western edge of the reconstruction is the 686 \nvegetation-covered end of the Serra Giannicola Grande (see Figure 2a). The white line indicates 687 \nthe positions of the cross sections given in (b) through surfaces constructed from surveys carried 688 \nout on the 27 September (Table 1). The three sections (through static ground) illustrate the 689 \nrepeatability of the results. (c) A typical image of flow-front 3 (taken during Survey 29b2 but 690 \npartially cropped for the figure). Arrows indicate the positions of the control targets (from the 691 \nsmall network) and the distance between the two targets with flagged arrows is 21 m. A 692 \nperspective view of the flow-front model produced in Survey 29c1\/2 (with mesh lines at 0.4 m 693 \nintervals) is given in (d). Horizontal ticks are every 5 m and the mesh is shaded by height change 694 \nsince Survey 29b2, which had been carried out an hour previously. Note the lobate nature of the 695 \nheight change, illustrating the uneven nature of the flow advance since Survey 29b2 (when the 696 \nmorphology was much like that seen in (c)). 697 \n 698 \nFigure 5. Thermal images showing the descent of a lava pulse on 27 September. The camera was 699 \nlooking approximately due north and local times are given in the top right of each panel. For 700 \nscale, the left-hand channel is approximately 10 m in width (see Figure 3). The two-channel 701 \nregion shown in each panel can be put in context by comparing with the wider view in Figure 2b. 702 \nThe points labelled in the first panel correspond to areas where the channel fill level was tracked 703 \nthroughout the thermal sequence (Figure 6b). Arrows in panels ii \u2013 v indicate the position of the 704 \npulse front as it enters the bifurcation (ii) and descends the flow-front 2 channel (iii \u2013 v). See text 705 \nfor discussion of the pulse sequence illustrated. 706 \n 707 \n 31\nFigure 6. Mean volumetric fluxes at flow-fronts and variation of channel fill levels. (a) 708 \nCalculated flux values between topographic surveys for the three flow-fronts monitored. Each 709 \nblack horizontal line gives the flux value calculated between surveys carried out at the times 710 \nindicated by the start and end positions of the line. The surrounding grey bands show the 711 \nestimated worst-case error bounds (see text for details). The survey IDs (see Table 1) are marked 712 \non the top axis at their appropriate times. Note the large error estimate between surveys 29b1 and 713 \n29b2 due to the very short duration between these surveys (5 minutes, Table 1). (b) Channel fill 714 \nlevels (taken from arbitrary origins) for two points on both channels. The point positions are 715 \nlabelled in the first panel image of Figure 5 and the data gap around 12:30 results from poor 716 \nvisibility due to cloud. A further data gap in the 2a trace around 15:45 resulted from the point 717 \ntracked being obscured by the body of the pulse as it passed.  718 \n 719 \nFigure 7. Channel surface velocities from optical flow. (a) The first image of the 18-image 720 \nsequence from which the average optical flow was calculated. The inset shows the region of 721 \ninterest on the flow-front 2 channel, with the calculated lava surface model overlain. In (b), this 722 \nlava surface model has been used to orthorectify the thermal data and the overlain flow vectors. 723 \nFor clarity, only a small proportion of the velocity vectors are plotted and the dashed lines 724 \nrepresent the channel margins (as determined from the thermal image sequence). The left-hand 725 \npanel shows topographic cross-sections taken perpendicular to the channel obtained from visible 726 \nimages taken on 28 September during a period of channel drainage (note the \u00d73 vertical 727 \nexaggeration). The calculated lava surface is shown in red. In (c), surface channel velocity 728 \nprofiles taken along sections A, B, and C in (b) are plotted. The channel margin positions as 729 \nindicated in (b) are given by the circles. Note that projecting the data onto a planar surface (i.e. 730 \ndisregarding the levee topography) exaggerates the horizontal scale in the levee regions. This, in 731 \nconjunction with any vertical error, is the reason why channel widths suggested by the 732 \northorectified thermal image data appear greater than those in the topographic cross sections. 733 \n 32\n 734 \nFigure 8. Down-flow sections through the flow-front 1 channel, 27 September. Black line 735 \nsegments represent topography from survey 27a (12:17, Table 1), grey segments are from survey 736 \n27b (78 minutes later), and the dashed line shows an estimate of the underlying topography. Line 737 \nsegments are only shown for regions visible from the camera positions (i.e. there are no 738 \ninterpolated regions); \u2018missing\u2019 segments are unobserved due to the oblique viewing geometry 739 \nand the undulose nature of the flow surface. The observed regions represent the leading faces 740 \nand crests of ogives, hence their changing position (tracked in thermal image sequences and 741 \nshown by the arrows) can be used to estimate flow velocity.742 \n 33\n 743 \nTable 1.
