The development of a complex multicellular organism from\na single initial cell is one of the most intriguing phenomena in the natural sciences.\nMathematical models have been widely used to investigate how embryonic cells be-\ncome organized in a collection of spatial structures and forms, a process called morpho-\ngenesis. Particular examples include the formation of structure, such as hair, scales,\nfeathers and glands, on the vertebrate skin. The skin is composed of two basic layers,\nthe epidermis and the dermis, which are separated by a thin layer of tissue called the\nbasal lamina. The vast majority of models proposed so far for morphogenesis in the\nskin have focused on pattern formation in one or other of these layers.\nTwo widely used models for pattern formation are reaction-di\u000busion models (Tur-\ning 1952) and mechanochemical models (see Murray, 1989 for review). Models of both\ntypes have been proposed as possible mechanisms underlying the formation of patterns\nin either the dermal or epidermal layers of skin.\nExperimental evidence (refer to Murray and Cruywagen (1994) for references)\nindicates, however, that there is a strong coupling between these two layers. Nagor-\ncka, Manoranjan, and Murray (1987) introduced the \frst tissue interaction models\nbased on coupled reaction-di\u000busion systems. Shaw and Murray (1990) used a coupled\nmechanochemical system to model tissue interaction. Both papers demonstrated that\na complex spatial pattern could arise from the coupling of two systems which could,\nindividually, give rise to pattern.\nThese initial tissue-interaction models have the common property of being able\nto produce patterns independently in the dermis and the epidermis. Biologically,\nhowever, the dermis cannot produce coherent patterns without the presence of the\nepidermis and vice versa. Cruywagen and Murray (1992) subsequently proposed a\n\u0003Received by the editors January 31, 1996; accepted for publication (in revised form) July 24,\n1996.\nhttp:\/\/www.siam.org\/journals\/siap\/57-6\/29790.html\nySea Fisheries Research Institute, Private Bag X2, Rogge Bay, 8012 Cape Town, South Africa.

K. MAINI, AND J. D. MURRAY\nmodel in which two mechanochemical-type systems can produce patterns only if they\nare coupled. Their model is more realistic, biologically, encompassing the crucial\ncomponents involved in tissue interaction. It is one of the more realistic models\nproposed thus far, since it includes mechanochemical features such as cell adhesion\nmolecules (CAMs) and tissue interaction via cell-cell signalling.\nHere we show with the aid of a bifurcation analysis that on a two-dimensional\ndomain, this model not only gives rise to the usual simple patterns but can also exhibit\nvastly complex patterns which are sometimes seen in nature.\nWe describe the full model in section 2. As this is a very complicated system\nwe derive a reduced form of the model which retains the key features of the full\nmodel. The reduced model, consisting of a parabolic equation coupled with an el-\nliptic equation, admits the usual basic uniform steady-state solution. In the appro-\npriate parameter space, determined by the linear analysis presented in section 3,\nthis steady state can be driven unstable and eventually evolves into a new nonho-\nmogeneous steady-state solution. To get a better idea of the patterns possible, we\nexamine the system analytically and numerically in the vicinity of the bifurcation\npoint.\nAlthough pattern formation models in one dimension have been extensively stud-\nied using bifurcation analysis, the complexity of the analysis on two-dimensional do-\nmains is such that only a few studies have been carried out. Maini and Murray\n(1988), analyzed the nonlinear behavior of a single equation model in the vicinity of\na simple eigenvalue. Ngwa and Maini (1995) investigated spatio-temporal patterns\nin a mechanical model using analytic and numerical techniques. Recently, a number\nof papers have analyzed the pattern formation properties of reaction-di\u000busion models\nin two dimensions (see Benson, Maini, and Sherratt (1997) and references therein).\nSuch detailed studies do not exist for mechanochemical models, and our purpose here\nis to extend the analysis to such models.\nWe consider our tissue interaction model on a two-dimensional rectangular do-\nmain, taken to model skin. This system bifurcates to spatial pattern at either a simple\neigenvalue, as is the case for the one-dimensional problem, or at a multiple eigenvalue.\nOf particular mathematical interest is the bifurcation problem from a multiple eigen-\nvalue, since, as far as we know, this has not been widely studied in tissue interaction\nmodels. The linear and nonlinear analyses of the equations in such cases are naturally\nmuch more involved. Instead of only single mode patterns evolving, various modes can\ninteract to produce mixed mode solutions. In these cases more complicated but also\nbiologically realistic patterns can evolve due to the interaction of di\u000berent modes of\npattern. However, the analysis is also much more complicated. In this paper, speci\fc\nattention is given to degenerate cases in the bifurcation analysis.\nThe bifurcation analysis gives a good indication of the type of patterns one could\nexpect for various parameter ranges. We look speci\fcally at rolls, rhombi, hexagons,\nand more complicated mixed mode patterns, since these are very common in nature.\nIn section 4 a weakly nonlinear multiple time-scale bifurcation analysis is used\nto examine the type of patterns that can arise. Speci\fc examples are considered in\nsection 5. For each, a bifurcation diagram is plotted and the solution predicted from\nthe nonlinear analysis is compared with numerical simulations of the model equations.\n2. The mathematical model. The model we consider here is a simpli\fed ver-\nsion of the original continuum tissue interaction model of Cruywagen and Murray\n(1992). We briefly describe this model and refer the reader to the original paper for\nfull details. By retaining only the most important components it is easier to examine\nthe speci\fc role played by di\u000berent biological processes in the formation of pattern.\nBIFURCATION ANALYSIS 1487\nThe model consists of two submodels, one for describing dermal cell movement\nand one for describing epithelial sheet deformation. These two submodels are coupled\nvia tissue interaction between the dermal and epithelial skin layers.\nThe epithelial sheet is modeled as a two-dimensional, visco-elastic continuum (see,\nfor example, Murray and Oster (1984); Murray (1989)). Since the system is in a low\nReynold\u2019s number regime, we assume that the visco-elastic and cell traction stresses\nwithin the epidermis are balanced by the external body forces. Assuming that the\n\feld variable u(x; t) represents the displacement at time t of a material point in the\nepithelial layer which was initially at position x, the force balance equation takes the\nform\nr\u0001\n8>><>>:\nelastic stressz }| {\nE\n1 + \u001d\n\u0002\n\"\u2212 \f1r2\"+ \u001d0(\u0012 \u2212 \f2r2\u0012)I\n\u0003\n+\nviscous stressz }| {\n\u00161\n@\"\n@t\n+ \u00162\n@\u0012\n@t\nI +\ntractionz }| {\n\u001cs2(n)\n(1 + cs2(n))\nI\n9>>=>>; =\nbody forcesz}|{\n\u001au ;(2.1)\nwhere \" = (ru + ruT )=2 is the strain tensor, \u0012 = r \u0001 u the dilation, T denotes\nthe transpose, and I is the unit tensor. The parameter \u001d0 = \u001d=(1 \u2212 2\u001d) where \u001d\nis Poisson\u2019s ratio, E is Young\u2019s modulus, and, \u00161 and \u00162 are the shear and bulk\nviscosities, respectively (Landau and Lifshitz (1970)).\nThe strength of the long-range elastic stresses are measured by \f1 and \f2 which\nare both positive (see Murray (1989) for a discussion of these terms). The epidermis\nis attached to the basal lamina with adhesion tethers; \u001a reflects the strength of these\nattachments. The epithelial sheet exerts active traction which we assume depends on a\nsignal chemical s, which di\u000buses from the dermis into the epidermis, thus introducing\ndermal to epidermal interaction. This active traction is modeled in the usual way by\na switch function (see, for example, Murray and Oster (1984)), with \u001c measuring the\nmagnitude of the switch and c the abruptness of the switch.\nAn epithelial cell conservation equation relates the epidermal cell density N(x; t)\nto the displacement u. Since the only contribution to cell flux is convection, the\nequation is simply\n@N\n@t\n=\nconvectionz }| {\n\u2212r \u0001N @u\n@t\n:(2.2)\nFor modeling dermal morphogenesis a chemotaxis equation, related to the cell-\nchemotaxis model of Oster and Murray (1989) and based on the morphoregulator\nhypothesis of Edelman (see, for example, Edelman (1986)) is used. According to this\nhypothesis, skin organ morphogenesis is controlled by cell-cell adhesion mechanisms\nmediated by CAMs. Chemical modulation can have a marked e\u000bect on the binding\nrates and binding strengths of CAMs (Grumet and Edelman (1988)), so we assume\nthat a chemical signal concentration e, di\u000busing from the epidermis into the dermis,\nis responsible for CAM expression, thus introducing epidermal to dermal interaction.\nThe conservation equation for dermal cell density, n(x; t), takes the form\n@n\n@t\n=\ndi\u000busionz }| {\nr \u0001Drn\u2212\nchemotaxisz }| {\nr \u0001 n\u000bre;(2.3)\n1488 G. C. CRUYWAGEN, P. K. MAINI, AND J. D. MURRAY\nwhere D is the coe\u000ecient of random di\u000busion and \u000b is the chemotactic factor. Both\nparameters are positive.\nWe assume, reasonably, that the chemicals e, di\u000busing from the epidermis to the\ndermis, and s, di\u000busing from the dermis to the epidermis, are produced by the cells\nin the epidermal and dermal layers, respectively. As a \frst approximation we express\nthe chemical concentrations as\ne(N) = keN; s(n) = ksn;(2.4)\nwhere ke and kn are positive constants. Note that the original system as proposed by\nCruywagen and Murray (1992) is much more involved, since they actually used four\nreaction-di\u000busion equations to model the chemical dynamics (two equations for each\nlayer).\nThe system (2.1), (2.2), (2.3), and (2.4) constitutes the \feld equations of our\ntissue-interaction model. The full system is extremely complex but by making a few\nreasonable biological assumptions it can in fact be reduced to two coupled nonlinear\nequations, thus making it more amenable to analysis, while still retaining the essential\nbiological features of the full model.\nIt is reasonable to assume that the epithelial viscosity parameters \u00161 and \u00162\nare negligibly small compared with the other parameters in the equation, so we set\nthem to zero. Note that taking the divergence of the epidermal tensor equation (2.1),\nreduces it to a scalar dilation equation in \u0012. Since the strains are very small in the\nepithelial sheet during the initial stages of morphogenesis, we can also apply the usual\nsmall strain assumption to equation (2.2). After linearizing about the steady state\nN = 1 a linear relationship N = 1\u2212 \u0012 between epidermal cell density and dilation is\nobtained. This relationship, along with equations (2.4), is substituted into equations\n(2.1) and (2.3) to give a simpli\fed caricature model.\nThe reduced model involves only an elliptic equation in epithelial dilation \u0012 and\na parabolic equation in dermal cell density, n, namely,\nr2\u0012 \u2212 \fr4\u0012 +r2\n\u001a\n\u001cn2\n1 + cn2\n\u001b\n= \u001a\u0012;(2.5a)\n@n\n@t\n= Dr2n\u2212r \u0001 (nr\u000b(1\u2212 \u0012)) ;(2.5b)\nwhere k2s has been incorporated into the parameters \u001c and c, ke has been included in\nthe parameter \u000b, \f = \f1 + \f2, and \f, \u001c , and \u001a have been divided by (1 + \u001d0).\nThe speci\fc tissue geometry considered is idealized as a rectangular domain B\nwith dimensions (Lx; Ly), and we assume zero-flux boundary conditions\n(\u0011 \u0001 r)n = 0; (\u0011 \u0001 r)\u0012 = 0; (\u0011 \u0001 r3)\u0012 = 0 on @B;(2.6)\nwhere \u0011 is the unit normal vector on the boundary @B of the domain B. This ensures\nthat the dermal and epidermal cell densities are conserved.\n3. Linear stability analysis.

We choose the chemotactic factor \u000b as our bifurcation parameter and\nde\fne \u000bc as the critical value at which the linear homogeneous steady state loses\nstability. For \u000b > \u000bc we have a range of unstable eigenvalues (k2\u2212; k\n2\n+) where\nk2\u0006 =\n(\u000bP \u2212D)\u0006p(\u000bP \u2212D)2 \u2212 4\f\u001aD2\n2\fD\n:\nAt the critical point where \u000b = \u000bc,\n(\u000bcP \u2212D)2 = 4\f\u001aD2;\nwhile the critical eigenvalue\nk2c =\n\u000bcP \u2212D\n2\fD\n:\nSolutions to the linear system (3.1) satisfying the boundary conditions (2.6) are\nw(x; t) =\n\u0012\n\u0012\nn\n\u0013\n=\nX\n~\u001e; ~ \npf (~\u001e; ~ )\n\u0012\n1\nM(k2)\n\u0013\ne\u0015(k\n2)t cos\u001ex cos y;(3.2)\nwhere the discrete wavevectors k = (\u001e;  )T are members of the sequence\n\u001e =\n~\u001e\u0019\nLx\n;  =\n~ \u0019\nLy\n; ~\u001e; ~ = 0; 1; 2; : : : ;(3.3)\nand\nM(k2) =\n\u2212\u000bk2\n\u0015(k2) +Dk2\n:\nEach pf (~\u001e; ~ ) is determined by a Fourier transform of the initial conditions.\n1490 G. C. CRUYWAGEN, P. K. MAINI, AND J. D.

Depending on the domain size, k\n2\nc could be either\na simple or a multiple eigenvalue. If k2c is a multiple eigenvalue, one or more of the\nmode pairs (~\u001e; ~ ) from the above sequence (3.3) satis\fes the expression\nk2c =\n \n~\u001e\u0019\nLx\n!2\n+\n \n~ \u0019\nLy\n!2\n:\nFor the square domain, Lx = Ly, some examples of mode pairs corresponding to\na simple eigenvalue are f(1; 1)g; f(2; 2)g: Double eigenvalues correspond to the sets of\nmode pairs f(0; 1); (1; 0)g; f(0; 2); (2; 0)g, while a triple eigenvalue would, for example,\ncorrespond to f(5; 5); (1; 7); (7; 1)g and so on.\nA large variety of linear patterns could develop from various sets of allowable\nmodes. Since the dermal cell density solution n di\u000bers from the epithelial dilation \u0012\nonly by the constant factor M(k2c ), its solution is qualitatively similar to that of \u0012.\nFor simplicity we shall therefore only examine the dilation solutions \u0012 of the linear\nproblem (3.1).\nIn general, single mode pair solutions give rise to rhombic spatial patterns, since\nthe linear time independent solution which emerges is of the form\n\u0012(x) = cos\u001ex cos y;(3.4)\nwhere kc = (\u001e;  )T is the discrete wavevector satisfying the zero-flux boundary con-\nditions (2.6). Note that the solution (3.4) has been scaled so that \u0012(0; 0) = 1.\nExpression (3.4) can be rewritten, in terms of polar coordinates (r; #), as\n\u0012(r; #) =\ncosf\u0014r cos(#\u2212 12\u2019)g+ cosf\u0014r cos(#+ 12\u2019)g\n2\n;(3.5)\nwhere\n\u0014 =\np\n\u001e2 +  2 =\np\nk2c ; \u2019 = 2 arccos\n\u0010\n\u001e=\np\nk2c\n\u0011\n:(3.6)\nIt is now easy to see that \u2019 represents the rhombic angle of the solution and that the\nsolution is indeed invariant under a rhombic rotation; that is,\n\u0012(r; #) = \u0012(r; #+ \u0019) = R\u0012(r; #) = \u0012(r; #);\nwhere R is the rhombic operator.\nIf \u2019 = \u0019=2 or \u2019 = 3\u0019=2, then \u001e =  and a square or chessboard-type pattern\nresults. This is a special case of the rhombic pattern, and the solution is square\nrotationally invariant.\nBIFURCATION ANALYSIS 1491\nFIG. 1.

Regions where the solution is\nlarger than 0:8 are shaded.\nThe simplest nonhomogeneous pattern possible on the two-dimensional rectan-\ngular domain is the roll, which occurs when either \u001e = 0 or  = 0 in the rhombic\nsolution (3.4). The roll is invariant under a rotation of \u0019.\nAll the linear patterned solutions arising from a simple eigenvalue, as discussed\nabove, tessellate the plane, since they satisfy\n\u0393(x+ j!1 + l!2) = \u0393(x);\nwhere \u0393 = (n; \u0012)T is the solution of the system, j, l are integers and !1, !2 are appro-\npriately chosen independent vectors. Patterns corresponding to multiple eigenvalues\nare not usually tessellations of the plane.\nA much richer class of mixed mode patterns does, however, exist. For exam-\nple, when we have a double eigenvalue k2c , with the two corresponding wavevectors,\nsay (\u001e1;  1)T and (\u001e2;  2)T , satisfying the zero-flux boundary conditions (2.6), two\nrhombic patterns interact; thus\n\u0012(x) = \u000b cos\u001e1x cos 1y + \f cos\u001e2x cos 2y;(3.7)\nwhere \u000b and \f are real numbers so that \u000b+\f = 1. (This scales the time-independent\nsolution so that \u0012(0; 0) = 1.) Speci\fcally, if we consider a square domain of dimen-\nsions (3; 3) and isolate the unstable eigenvalue k2c = 40\u0019\n2=9, then the corresponding\nunstable mode pairs are (2; 6) and (6; 2). The time-independent solution to the linear\nproblem, where \u000b = \f = 1=2, is as illustrated in Figure 1.\nMixed mode patterns can vary considerably depending on the modes interacting.\nThere is, however, a simple pattern tessellating the plane that can be generated by\ntwo interacting modes.

Contour graph of the linear hexagonal pattern corresponding to the mode pairs (6; 2) and\n(0; 4) plotted on the rectangular domain (2\np\n3; 2); see expression (3.9). Regions where the solution\nis larger than 0:8 are shaded.\nand \u000b = 2=3, \f = 1=3, then a hexagonal pattern results. With wavevectors as in (3.8)\nthe solution can be written as\n\u0012(x) =\ncos\u0014(\np\n3y + x) + cos\u0014(\np\n3y \u2212 x) + cos 2\u0014x\n3\n;(3.10)\nwhich, in terms of polar coordinates (r; #), is\n\u0012(x) =\ncosf2\u0014r sin(#+ \u00196 )g+ cosf2\u0014r sin(#\u2212 \u00196 )g+ cosf2\u0014r sin(#\u2212 \u00192 )g\n3\n:\nThe polar coordinate form shows the invariance of \u0012 under a hexagonal rotation, that\nis, invariance to rotation by \u0019=3; thus\n\u0012(r; #) = \u0012\n\u0010\nr; #+\n\u0019\n3\n\u0011\n= H\u0012(r; #) = \u0012(r; #);\nwhere H is the hexagonal rotation operator.\nAs an illustrative example, assume that the uniform steady state is unstable to\nmodes for the case k2c = 4\u0019\n2 on the domain (2\np\n3; 2). The corresponding mode pairs\nare (6; 2) and (0; 4) so that the two wavevectors have the required form (3.9), where\n\u0014 = \u0019. The resulting pattern is shown in Figure 2. Note that hexagonal solutions not\nonly satisfy zero-flux conditions on the boundaries of a rectangular domain, but do\nso also on all the hexagonal symmetry boundaries.\nNaturally, where we have a triple or higher multiple eigenvalue, a much richer\nand more complex range of linear patterns is possible.\nWe have only considered linear solutions in this section. It is, however, impor-\ntant to realize that linear analysis gives only a rough indication as to the patterns\nwe should expect from nonlinear systems. To fully investigate our nonlinear tissue\ninteraction problem (2.5), a weakly nonlinear analysis as well as numerical simulations\nare necessary.\n4. Nonlinear bifurcation analysis. We consider, as mentioned above, the\ntwo-dimensional system on the rectangular domain B = (Lx; Ly) and assume the\nzero-flux boundary conditions as given in (2.6). We further choose the magnitude of\nthe dimensions Lx and Ly so that stability is lost at an isolated multiple eigenvalue\nk2c . We perform a perturbation analysis in the neighborhood of this eigenvalue by\nsetting\n\u000b = \u000bc + \u000b1\u000f+ \u000b2\u000f2 + \u000b3\u000f3 + \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 ; where 0 < \u000f\u001c 1;(4.1)\nBIFURCATION ANALYSIS 1493\nand also\nt = T1=\u000f+ T2=\u000f2 + T3=\u000f3 + \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 ;(4.2)\nthus introducing the multiple time scales\nT1 = \u000ft; T2 = \u000f2t; T3 = \u000f3t;\nand so on (refer to Matkowsky (1970)).\nWe assume a power series expansion for \u0012 and n of the form\n\u0012(x; \u000f; T1; : : :) = \u000f\u00121(x; T1; : : :) + \u000f2\u00122(x; T1; : : :) + \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 ;(4.3a)\nn(x; \u000f; T1; : : :) = 1 + \u000fn1(x; T1; : : :) + \u000f2n2(x; T1; : : :) + \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 ;(4.3b)\nwhere the variables \u0012 and n are considered as functions of x, \u000f, and Ti, i = 1; 2; 3; : : :.\nFor algebraic simplicity we initially set\n~n(x; \u000f; T1; : : :) = 1\u2212 n(x; \u000f; T1; : : :)\nand substitute this into the interaction term of equation (2.5a).

Again we use the\nFredholm alternative to suppress these secular terms as we shall show below. This\nleads to the typical Landau-type amplitude equations. To determine the amplitude\nequations when the multiplicity of the eigenvalue is higher than two involves highly\ncomplex algebraic manipulation. We therefore restrict our analysis to the simpler\ncases where \u0001 = 1 and \u0001 = 2. There are three main cases to consider.\n\u0001 = 1. If \u0001 = 1, then \u001e1 =  1 = \u001e and secular terms appear in the O(\u000f3)\nsolution. To supress these secular terms we use the Fredholm alternative.

The eigenvalues of\nthis system are\n\u0015 =\n1\n2\nm2;2 \u0006 12\nq\nm22;2 + 4m1;2m2;1;\nand since m2;2 > 0 and m1;2m2;1 > 0, they are always positive. Thus no stable\nsteady-state pattern is possible for this speci\fc mode combination.\nSince hexagonal patterns fall within the class of patterns considered here, the\nnonlinear analysis therefore predicts that our small strain quasi-steady-state tissue\ninteraction system does not exhibit steady-state hexagonal patterned solutions arising\nas primary bifurcations from the uniform steady state (but see section 5, Example\n5.6).\n\u0001 = 2 and secular terms appear at O(\u000f3).

There\nare three cases to consider.\nCase 1. If \u001ei 6= 0 and  i 6= 0, i = 1; 2, then terms of the form cos\u001eix cos iy\nappear only in the expression for R0 in equation (4.11). The values of \u21261, \u21262, and\n\u0007 = \u00071 = \u00072 obtained after using the Fredholm alternative are given in Appendix D.\nCase 2. If one and only one of \u001ei or  i, i = 1; 2 is equal to zero, then terms of\nthe form cos\u001eix cos iy not only appear in the expression for R0 but also in R1 or\nR2 and R3 or R4 (see equation (4.11)). As before it is su\u000ecient to consider only one\ncase, say\n\u001e1 6= 0;  1 6= 0; \u001e2 = 0;  2 6= 0;\nwhere \u001e21 +  \n2\n1 =  \n2\n2 .\nFor this particular set of wavevectors, terms of the form cos\u001eix cos iy appear in\nR0, R1, and R3. Suppressing the secular terms results in the same expressions for\n\u21261 and \u00072 as in Case 1 above. Expressions for \u21262 and \u00072 are given in Appendix D.\nCase 3. If one and only one of \u001e1 =  2 = 0 or \u001e2 =  1 = 0 is true, then terms\nof the form cos\u001eix cos iy appear in the expression for R0, R1 or R2, and R3 or\nR4 (see equation (4.11)). Again it is su\u000ecient to consider only one combination of\nwavevectors, say\n\u001e1 = \u001e;  1 = 0; \u001e2 = 0;  2 = \u001e:\nThe values of \u21261, \u21262, and \u0007 = \u00071 = \u00072 obtained after using the Fredholm\nalternative are given in Appendix D.\n1500 G. C. CRUYWAGEN, P. K. MAINI, AND J. D. MURRAY\nThis weakly nonlinear analysis gives a good indication of what type of patterns\nto expect as well as parameter ranges for which various steady-state patterns would\nexist. Numerical simulations for speci\fc examples are considered in the next section to\nverify our calculations and to illustrate some of the patterns exhibited by the model.\n5. Numerical simulations. In this section we use numerical methods to solve\nthe reduced small strain quasi-steady-state system (2.5) on rectangular domains. We\nselect parameters so that we are in the vicinity of a primary bifurcation point from\nthe uniform steady state. The numerical results can then be compared with those\npredicted by the bifurcation analysis of the previous section.\nAn implicit \fnite di\u000berence numerical scheme is used to solve the nonlinear equa-\ntions (2.5). For examples where the small parameter \u000f = 0:1, the computation took\non average about 15 to 20 hours CPU time to reach a steady-state solution on a\nDEC5500 Risc Ultrix computer. For smaller values of \u000f, for example, \u000f = 0:01, the\ngrowth rate of the patterns are even slower so that it becomes impractical to solve\nthe model equations in real time.\nIn the \frst example we solve the system for parameter values such that the uniform\nsteady state is linearly unstable to only one mode. In all the other examples, the\nuniform steady state is linearly unstable to two modes. As initial conditions we\nused random perturbations with minimum and maximum values \u00060:001, about the\nhomogeneous steady state \u0012 = 0, n = 1, to simulate the natural inhomogeneties\npresent in skin tissue.\nTo ensure that the numerical method employed is stable and convergent we solved\nthe equations using di\u000berent mesh sizes in both time and space. Because of computer\ntime constraints we never used more than a 1000 mesh points for discretizing the\nrectangle B.\nExample 5.1. We consider system (2.5) and isolate the eigenvalue k2c = 4\u0019\n2. For\nisolating an eigenvalue, say k2c , the following two equations must be satis\fed:\n\fk4c \u2212 \u001a = 0;(5.1a)\n(\u000bcP2 \u2212D)k2c \u2212 2\u001aD = 0:(5.1b)\nFor linear instability, the value of the bifurcation parameter, \u000b in this case, must be\nincreased marginally beyond the critical value \u000bc.\nOne set of parameter values that satis\fes the above equations when k2c = 4\u0019\n2 is\n\f = 0:0126651; \u001a = 19:7369; \u001c = 4:0; c = 1:0; D = 2:0; \u000bc = 2:0:\nOn the square domain (\np\n2;\np\n2), these parameter values result in the (2; 2) mode being\nisolated. The analytical prediction for the steady state pattern, as obtained in the\nnonlinear analysis of the previous section, is therefore given in (4.15). We computed\nthe expressions for \u2126 and \u0393 (see equation (4.14)) for the above parameter set. With\n\u000f = 0:1 the predicted solution for large time is\n\u0012(x; y; t) \u0019 0:16 cos\n\u0012\n2\u0019xp\n2\n\u0013\ncos\n\u0012\n2\u0019yp\n2\n\u0013\n;\nn(x; y; t) \u0019 1\u2212 0:16 cos\n\u0012\n2\u0019xp\n2\n\u0013\ncos\n\u0012\n2\u0019yp\n2\n\u0013\n:\nThis is in excellent agreement with the numerically computed solutions for \u0012 and n\nwhich reach maximum and minimum amplitudes for large time of 0:16 and \u22120:16,\nrespectively.\nBIFURCATION ANALYSIS 1501\nFIG. 3. The qualitative bifurcation diagram for the steady-state solutions associated with various\nmode pairs of system (4.19) when the parameter values are as in Example 5:2. The two mode pairs\nare (2; 3) and (3; 2). Solid lines indicate stable steady states, while broken lines indicate unstable\nsteady states.\nExample 5.2. In this example the model parameters are selected so as to isolate\nthe eigenvalue k2c = 6:5\u0019\n2. By using equations (5.1) we \fnd that a possible parameter\nset is\n\f = 0:00779393; \u001a = 32:0762; \u001c = 4:0; c = 1:0; D = 2:0; \u000bc = 2:0:\nAs in the \frst example, we consider the problem on the domain (\np\n2;\np\n2); however,\nin this case, the uniform steady state is linearly unstable to two modes, namely (2; 3)\nand (3; 2).\nWe can now use expressions (4.22) for determining the steady states and (4.23)\nfor determining their stability. Note that the values of \u2126i and \u0007i are as in Case 1.\nThere are three nonhomogeneous steady states|two single mode steady states which\nare stable and a mixed mode steady state which is unstable. We can now construct\nthe bifurcation diagram as predicted by the nonlinear analysis. So as to separate the\ntwo single mode steady states on the bifurcation diagram when they have the same\nvalue, we plot the bifurcation parameter \u000bc against the value\nq\nA\n(si)\n1 + 2A\n(si)\n1 (see\nFigure 3).\nThe amplitudes of the steady-state solutions were computed from (4.22) and the\npredicted solutions (see (4.24)) are\n\u0012(x; y; t) \u0019 0:16 cos\n\u0012\n2\u0019xp\n2\n\u0013\ncos\n\u0012\n3\u0019yp\n2\n\u0013\n;\nn(x; y; t) \u0019 1:0\u2212 0:16 cos\n\u0012\n2\u0019xp\n2\n\u0013\ncos\n\u0012\n3\u0019yp\n2\n\u0013\nor\n\u0012(x; y; t) \u0019 0:16 cos\n\u0012\n3\u0019xp\n2\n\u0013\ncos\n\u0012\n2\u0019yp\n2\n\u0013\n;\nn(x; y; t) \u0019 1:0\u2212 0:16 cos\n\u0012\n3\u0019xp\n2\n\u0013\ncos\n\u0012\n2\u0019yp\n2\n\u0013\n:\nSince we are dealing with a square domain and the problem is invariant under a\nchange of x and y, the above two solutions are equivalent. Our numerical solutions\nhave maximum and minimum values of 0:17 and \u22120:17, respectively, which compare\nvery well with our analytical predictions as shown in Figure 4.\nExample 5.3. By selecting the parameter set\n\f = 0:005960; \u001a = 41:9458; \u001c = 4:2025; c = 1:05; D = 2:0; \u000b = 2:0;\n1502 G. C. CRUYWAGEN, P. K. MAINI, AND J. D. MURRAY\nFIG. 4. The computed dilation solution \u0012 for parameter values as in Example 5:2 is shown in\nthe contour graph (a), while the predicted solution is shown in (b). Regions where \u0012 \u0015 0:05 are\nshaded in both graphs.\nwe isolate the unstable eigenvalue k2c = 8:5\u0019\n2. On the square domain (\np\n2;\np\n2) the\nuniform steady state is linearly unstable to the modes (1; 4) and (4; 1). The bifurcation\ndiagram, calculated from our nonlinear analysis, is similar to that in Figure 3. Here,\nhowever, the mixed mode solution is stable, while the two single mode solutions are\nunstable. So the expected solution is\n\u0012(x; y; t) \u0019 0:14 cos\n\u0012\n\u0019xp\n2\n\u0013\ncos\n\u0012\n4\u0019yp\n2\n\u0013\n+ 0:14 cos\n\u0012\n4\u0019xp\n2\n\u0013\ncos\n\u0012\n\u0019yp\n2\n\u0013\n;\nn(x; y; t) \u0019 1:0\u2212 0:14 cos\n\u0012\n\u0019xp\n2\n\u0013\ncos\n\u0012\n4\u0019yp\n2\n\u0013\n+ 0:14 cos\n\u0012\n4\u0019xp\n2\n\u0013\ncos\n\u0012\n\u0019yp\n2\n\u0013\n:\nThe numerical simulations of the nonlinear system do indeed evolve to a mixed mode\nsolution, as seen in Figure 5. Although the peaks in our numerical solution are not\nas high as those in our predicted solution, the troughs are almost of equal depth, and\nthe two solutions share similar characteristics. Hence the solutions are qualitatively\nsimilar.\nExample 5.4. Here we select the parameters\n\f = 0:00405285; \u001a = 61:6850; \u001c = 4:5; c = 1:12132; D = 2:0; \u000b = 2:0;\nto isolate the unstable eigenvalue k2c = 12:5\u0019\n2. If we consider the system of equations\non the rectangular domain (\np\n2;\np\n2=2), the uniform steady state is linearly unstable\nto the modes (5; 0) and (3; 2). Our bifurcation diagram allows for only the two single\nmode steady states|one is stable and the other unstable (see Figure 6).\nThe expressions for \u2126i and \u0007i, i = 1; 2, are as in Case 2. The predicted steady-\nstate solution is\n\u0012(x; y; t) \u0019 0:23 cos\n\u0012\n3p\n2\n\u0019x\n\u0013\ncos\n\u0012\n4\u0019yp\n2\n\u0013\n;\nn(x; y; t) \u0019 1:0\u2212 0:23 cos\n\u0012\n3p\n2\n\u0019x\n\u0013\ncos\n\u0012\n4\u0019yp\n2\n\u0013\n:\nFor both random initial conditions and stripe-like initial conditions resembling the\nmode (5; 0), we found a steady-state solution resembling the predicted mode. The\ntroughs of the computed pattern have minimum values \u22120:23, while the peaks have\na maximum value of 0:28. The error is therefore O(\u000f2) as expected.\nBIFURCATION ANALYSIS 1503\nFIG. 5.

The qualitative bifurcation diagram for the steady-state solutions of system (4.19) when\nthe parameter values are as in Example 5:4. The steady state associated with the \frst mode pair,\n(5; 0), is unstable and that associated with the second, (3; 2), is stable.\nExample 5.5. In this example we isolate the unstable eigenvalue satisfying k2c =\n9\u00192. To do this we choose the parameters\n\f = 0:00562895; \u001a = 44:4132; \u001c = 4:8; c = 1:19089; D = 2:0; \u000b = 2:0:\nWe consider the problem on the square domain (1; 1) so that the uniform steady\nstate is linearly unstable to the modes (2; 0) and (0; 2). The bifurcation diagram is\nsimilar to that in the previous example (see Figure 6) except for the fact that both\nthe nonhomogeneous steady states are now stable.

Contour graph of the numerically computed steady-state solution \u0012 for the parameter\nset in Example 5:6. A hexagonal-type pattern arises due to a secondary bifurcation.\nnow as in Case 3. The nonlinear analysis predicts either\n\u0012(x; y; t) \u0019 0:30 cos(3\u0019x);\nn(x; y; t) \u0019 1:0\u2212 0:30 cos(3\u0019x)\nor\n\u0012(x; y; t) \u0019 0:30 cos(3\u0019y);\nn(x; y; t) \u0019 1:0\u2212 0:30 cos(3\u0019y);\nas the steady state solutions. The numerical solutions have amplitudes of \u00060:17. This\nis much smaller than predicted, so the nonlinear analysis does not give such accurate\nresults for this case. Qualitatively, however, the solutions are identical.\nExample 5.6. We show an example in which the prediction by the weakly nonlinear\nanalysis fails. We isolate the same eigenvalue as in Example 5.2 and use the same\nparameters except for\n\u001c = 3:0625; c = 0:75:\nOur bifurcation diagram is similar to that in Example 5.3, so that we expect the mixed\nmode solution, made up of the mode pairs (2; 3) and (3; 2), to develop. Numerical\nsimulations show, however, that the mixed steady state is only a transient and that a\nhexagonal-type steady-state pattern eventually develops|each peak is closest to its\nsix nearest neighbors (see Figure 7).\nIt seems, therefore, that a secondary bifurcation has occurred here. Our nonlinear\nanalysis, however, cannot predict this since it only applies to primary bifurcation\npoints. Therefore, although our weakly nonlinear analysis indicates that hexagonal\npatterns are not possible, such steady patterns could still evolve due to secondary\nbifurcations. Another possibility is that an alternative scaling of the equations may\ngive results consistent with our numerical solutions (Wheeler (1985)). Due to the\nalgebraic complexity of the system, we do not pursue this further. The key result\nis that the numerical simulations show that the model can exhibit stable hexagonal\npatterns.\nBIFURCATION ANALYSIS 1505\nIn the majority of examples considered, the numerical results agreed well with the\nperturbation solutions obtained from the multiscale bifurcation analysis. Even bet-\nter agreement could have been achieved by using smaller values for the perturbation\nparameter \u000f. Furthermore, the mesh size used in the \fnite di\u000berence approximations\nwas rather crude and a \fner mesh would also contribute toward more accurate solu-\ntions. However, due to computing time constraints it was impractical to incorporate\nthese features into our simulations.\n6. Conclusion. In this paper we have presented a weakly nonlinear analysis\nto determine the pattern-forming capability of a tissue interaction model for skin\norgan formation on a rectangular domain. This model hypothesizes that skin organ\nformation occurs as a result of cell aggregation followed by the di\u000berentiation of\ncells in high density aggregates. This model hypothesis is di\u000berent from that of\nreaction di\u000busion theory, in which it is assumed that cell density remains uniform,\nbut cells di\u000berentiate in response to a spatially varying prepattern in some chemical\nmorphogen. There is strong experimental evidence that patterns in the skin arise\ndue to cell aggregation (see, for example, Wessells (1965) and Murray, Deeming, and\nFerguson (1990)).\nThis model di\u000bers from others in the literature in that dermal-epidermal tissue\ninteraction is a prerequisite for spatial pattern formation. In this respect, it agrees\nwell with biological observations. We are unaware of other models which reflect this\ndermal-epidermal interdependence. Most skin pattern formation models give rise to\npatterns in either layer, completely independent of the other layer.\nThe bifurcation analysis, although very complex, enabled us to derive parameter\nspaces in which certain patterns occur. It furthermore provided an indication of\nthe wealth of patterns that the model can exhibit. Due to the large number of\nmodel parameters, it would have been an impossible task to identify all the various\nsolutions numerically. However, the analysis we presented, which holds only in the\nvicinity of primary bifurcation points, is somewhat limited in that the model can also\nproduce other types of patterns. An important class of patterns that cannot arise\nfrom a primary bifurcation in this model are hexagonal patterns. Such patterns are\nconsidered to be very stable and are common in nature. Recently, a number of studies\nof hexagonal pattern formation in chemical systems have been carried out (see, for\nexample, Maini, Painter, and Chau (1997)). However, Example 5.6 shows that stable\nhexagonal patterns can arise in our model as a result of what we conjecture is a\nsecondary bifurcation.\nAnother limitation of the analysis is that when the uniform steady state is linearly\nunstable to multiple modes, as in Example 5.2, the domain of attraction of initial\nconditions for each of the modes cannot be predicted. To determine which solution is\npreferred for a speci\fc set of initial conditions, the system has to be solved numerically.\nIn many cases, skin organ patterns are actually laid down sequentially, and it is\nbelieved that travelling waves of determination (Zeeman (1974)) often initiate mor-\nphogenetic processes. For example, stripe pigment patterns on the alligator develop\nsequentially. The hexagonal pattern of feather germs observed on dorsal chick skin\nactually arises as a wave of spatio-temporal pattern sweeps outward from the dorsal\nmidline.\nCruywagen, Maini, and Murray (1992) discuss the modeling of sequential pattern\nformation and illustrate how the tissue interaction model described here can actually\nproduce patterns sequentially. The more detailed version of the tissue interaction\nmodel does in fact possess travelling wave solutions (Cruywagen, Maini, and Murray\n1506 G. C. CRUYWAGEN, P. K. MAINI, AND J. D. MURRAY\n(1994a)). The model can also sustain spatial patterns in the wake of a travelling wave\n(Cruywagen, Maini, and Murray (1994b)).\nIn this paper, we have shown that a variety of spatial patterns can also occur\nas stable solutions to the reduced small strain quasi-steady-state system (2.5). The\npatterns illustrated in Examples 5.1 and 5.6 resemble those of feather germs on chicken\nskin. The stripe-like pigment patterns seen on alligators are similar to the solution\nof Example 5.5 (see Murray, Deeming, and Ferguson (1990)).
