INTRODUCTION\nThe Skyrme model1 is widely accepted as an effective theory to describe the low-energy\nproperties of nucleons. It was indeed shown2\u20134 that in the large Nc limit, the Skyrme model is the\nlow-energy limit of QCD. The classical static solutions of the model describe the bound states of\nnucleons and every configuration is characterized by a topological charge which, following\nSkyrme\u2019s idea, is interpreted as the baryon charge.\nThe Skyrme model can be used to predict the properties of the nucleons within 10% to 20%.3,4\nTo improve these phenomenological predictions various extensions of the model have been pro-\nposed mostly by adding higher order terms5\u20138 or extra fields9 to the Lagrangian.\nThe study of the classical solutions of the Skyrme model has been done mostly using numeri-\ncal methods, but recently Houghton et al.10 showed that the classical solutions of the SU~2! model\ncan be well approximated by using an ansatz that involves the harmonic maps from S2 to S2. The\nharmonic map describes the angular distribution of the solution while a profile function describes\nits radial distribution. This construction was later generalized11 for the SU(N) model using har-\nmonic maps from S2 to CPN21. Moreover, it was shown that using a further generalization of this\nansatz one can construct exact spherically symmetric solutions of the SU(N) Skyrme model.\nThe same method was also used in Ref. 12 to construct solutions of another SU(N) fourth\norder Skyrme model. In this article, we use the same generalized ansatz to construct solutions of\nthe sixth order SU~3! Skyrme model and low-energy configurations of the SU(N) models defined\nin Ref. 13.\nII. THE SIXTH ORDER SKYRME MODEL\nThe Skyrme model is described by an SU(N) valued field U(xW ,t) which, to ensure finiteness\nof the energy, is required to satisfy the boundary condition U\u2192I as uxW u\u2192\u2018 , where I is the unit\nmatrix. This boundary condition implies that the three dimensional Euclidean space on which the\nmodel is defined can be compactified into S3 and, as a result, the Skyrme field U corresponds to\nmappings from S3 into SU(N). As p3(SU(N))5Z each configuration is characterized by its\nwinding number, or topological charge, which can be obtained explicitly by evaluating the expres-\nsion\na!Electronic mail: ioannis.floratos@durham.ac.uk\nb!Electronic mail: b.m.a.g.piette@durham.ac.uk\nJOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS VOLUME 42, NUMBER 12 DECEMBER 2001\n55800022-2488\/2001\/42(12)\/5580\/16\/$18.00 \u00a9 2001 American Institute of Physics\nDownloaded 26 Apr 2011 to 129.234.252.66.

Skyrme model have been studied in Ref. 13 where\nit was shown that they have the same symmetry as the pure Skyrme model. It was also shown that\nthe harmonic map ansatz gives a good approximation to the solutions.\nIn the next section we describe the harmonic map ansatz. In the third section we prove that\ndue to a constraint coming from the sixth order term, the multi-projector harmonic map ansatz\nprovides exact solutions only for the SU~3! generalized model. We then show that one can nev-\nertheless use the ansatz to construct low-energy configurations of the SU(N) models. In the fourth\nsection we look at these configurations for the SU~4! model, while in the last section we look at\nsome special ansatz for the SU(N) model.\nIII. HARMONIC MAP ANSATZ\nThe rational map ansatz, introduced by Houghton et al.,10 is a generalization of the hedgehog\nansatz found by Skyrme,1 to approximate multi-Skyrmion solution of the SU~2! model. The ansatz\nwas later generalized by Ioannidou et al.14 to approximate solutions of the SU(N) Skyrme model\nusing harmonic maps from S2 into CPN21. This generalized ansatz is given by\nU~r ,u ,w!5e2i f (r)(P(u ,w)2I\/N)5e22i f (r)\/N~I1~e2i f (r)21 !P~u ,w!!, ~5!\nwhere r ,u and w are the usual polar coordinates. The profile function f (r) must satisfy the\nboundary conditions f (0)5p and limr\u2192\u2018 f (r)50 and P(u ,w) is a projector in CN which must be\na harmonic map from S2 into CPN21 or equivalently a classical solution of the two dimensional\nCPN21 s model. These solutions are well known15,16 and to construct them it is convenient to\nintroduce the complex coordinate j5tan(u\/2)eiw which corresponds to the stereographic projec-\ntion of the unit sphere onto the complex plane.\nIn these coordinates, P must satisfy the equation\nP\n]P\n]j\n50, ~6!\nand the solutions of that equation are given by any projector of the form\n5581J.

This winding number is itself given by the\ndegree of the harmonic function h15,16 which must then be a rational function of j.\nTo approximate a solution, one plugs the ansatz ~5! into the energy ~2! and notices that if P\nsatisfies ~6!, the integration over the polar angles and the radius decouple. One then has to\nminimize the integral over the polar angles of an expression which depends only on P . Taking for\nP the most general harmonic map of the desired degree, one then has to find the parameters of the\ngeneral map which minimize that integral. Having done this, the profile function f is obtained by\nsolving the Euler Lagrange equation derived from the effective energy.\nA special case of this construction is the so-called hedgehog ansatz for the SU~2! model\ncorresponding to one Skyrmion. In this case, we have h5(1,j) t and after inserting ~7! into ~2! the\nenergy reduces to\nE5\n1\n3p E drS f r2 r212 sin2 f ~11~12l! f r2!1~12l! sin\n4 f\nr2\n1l\nsin4 f\nr2\nf r2D , ~9!\nand the equation for f is given by\nf rrS 112 ~12l! sin2 fr2 1l sin\n4 f\nr4\nD1 2\nr\nf r S 12l sin4 fr4 D\n1\nsin 2g\nr2\nS ~12l! f r2211 sin2 fr2 ~l f r2211l!

SPHERICALLY SYMMETRIC SOLUTIONS FOR THE SU\u0084N\u0085 MODEL\nIn this section we will follow the construction described in Ref. 14, to attempt to construct\nsolutions of the extended SU(N) Skyrme model using a generalization of the harmonic map ansatz\n~5!.\nTo build the new ansatz we need to introduce an operator P1 which acts on any complex\nvector uPCN and is defined as\nP1u5]ju2u\nu\u2020 ]ju\nuuu2\n. ~11!\nTaking a holomorphic vector h(j) we then define P01h5h and by induction Vk5P1k h\n5P1(P1k21h).

Moreover, for the ansatz to be well\ndefined, the profile functions gk(r) must be a multiple of 2p at the origin and at infinity.\nTo proceed with our construction, it is convenient to rewrite the Euler\u2013Lagrange equations of\nthe model ~3! using the usual spherical coordinates\nFIG. 2.

Using ~13! one can get rid of the projector PN21 and ~19! will then be the sum of the\nN21 terms Pi2 I\/N for i50, . . . , N22, with coefficients that depend only on r . This implies that\nthe equations for the Skyrme model reduce to N21 ordinary differential equations for the profile\nfunctions gi and their solutions, if they exist, will provide us with exact solutions of the SU(N)\nSkyrme model.\nIn what follows we will show that the angular dependence of the terms proportional to l in\n~19!, i.e., the terms coming from the sixth order term, is also coming exclusively from the\nprojectors Pi2 I\/N or Pi2Pi21 , but that we have to impose an extra constraint on the profile\nfunctions gi .\nWe start by noting that\n@Rj ,Rj\u00af#52 (\ni51\nN21\nai\n2 uViu\n2\nuVi21u2\nS ViVi\u2020uViu2 2 Vi21Vi21\n\u2020\nuVi21u2\nD , ~22!\n@Rr ,Rj#5i (\ni51\nN21\n~ g\u02d9 iai2 g\u02d9 i21ai!\nViVi21\n\u2020\nuVi21u2\n5 (\ni51\nN21\nKi\nViVi21\n\u2020\nuVi21u2\n, ~23!\n@Rr ,Rj\u00af#5i (\ni51\nN21\n~ g\u02d9 iai2 g\u02d9 i21ai!\nVi21Vi\n\u2020\nuVi21u2\n5 (\ni51\nN21\nKi\nVi21Vi\n\u2020\nuVi21u2\n, ~24!\nwhere ai5ei(gi2gi21)21.

Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/jmp.aip.org\/about\/rights_and_permissions\nIn Table III we present the energy values of various types of configurations when l50 and\nl51. We notice that when l50, the solutions are symmetric under the exchange f 0\u2194 f 2 , but that\nthe sixth order term breaks the symmetry. This results in a difference of energy between the\nconfiguration with n050, n150, n251 and n051, n150, n250 as well as between the configu-\nrations with n051, n151, n250 and n050, n151, n251. In Fig. 4, we present the curve for the\nenergy of the configurations as a function of l.\nVII. SU\u0084N\u0085 LOW-ENERGY CONFIGURATION\nAfter inserting the ansatz ~5! in the full equation for the SU(N) model, we found that we had\nonly two independent profile functions g0 and g1 and that the ansatz would only provide solutions\nfor the SU~3! model. One can nevertheless use the SU(N) ansatz to compute low-energy configu-\nrations. For example, if we consider the reduced ansatz defined by ~5! together with the constraint\ng\u02d9 i222g\u02d9 i235g\u02d9 i2g\u02d9 i22 and define the profiles F5g02g1 and g5gN22 we can minimize the\nenergy ~40! and solve the equations for F and g for various boundary conditions. We found that\nto get configurations corresponding to a bound state, i.e., a configuration with an energy per\nSkyrmion smaller than the energy of the hedgehog solution, we must take nF50 and ng51. The\nenergies that we found are given in Table IV.\nIn Figs. 5 and 6 we present the profile and the energy density for different values of N and for\nl50.5. It shows that the energy density has the shape of a hollow sphere of radius r50.7AN . The\nprofile g has the same shape for all values of N but is shifted to the right as N increases. The\nprofile F , on the other hand, is also shifted as the shell radius increases, but its amplitude\ndecreases like 1\/N2. Note that in Fig. 6, the profiles for N5100 and N5200 have been multiplied\nby 100 to make them visible. For other values of l the graphics look very much the same except\nthat the shell radius and width are slightly different, but the conclusions remain the same.\nFigure 6~b! suggests to simplify the ansatz further for large N by taking F(r)50.

We see that this configuration corresponds to a bound state\nof Skyrmions and that the energy per Skyrmion decreases with N . The energy of this configuration\ncorresponds to an upper bound for the energy of the B5N21 radially symmetric solution of the\nSU(N) model and these configurations correspond to bound states of Skyrmions for all values of\nN and all values of l. As every SU(p) solution can be trivially embedded in an SU(q) solution\nwhen p <q we can claim that for every B,N the SU(N) model has a radially symmetric solution\nof charge B corresponding to a bound state. With the exception of the hedgehog solutions, these\nsolutions are expected to be unstable when the radial symmetry is broken as their energies are\nlarger than the known SU~2! solutions.13\nVIII. CONCLUSIONS\nIn this article we have shown how to construct some radially symmetric solutions of the SU~3!\nsixth order Skyrme model. The construction is similar to the one used for the pure Skyrme model\nin Ref. 14 except that, because of an extra constraint, the construction only works for the SU~3!\nFIG. 7.

The same ansatz can nevertheless be used to compute low-energy configurations of the\nSU(N) model. In particular we showed that for every N there is a radially symmetric solution of\ncharge B,N which corresponds to a bound state of Skyrmions.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nWe would like to thank W. J.
