We consider the fault-tolerant capabilities of networks of processors whose underlying\ntopology is that of the k-ary n-cube Qkn, where k \u2265 3 and n \u2265 2. In particular, given a copy of Qkn\nwhere some of the interprocessor links may be faulty but where every processor is incident with at\nleast two healthy links, we show that if the number of faults is at most 4n\u2212 5, then Qkn still contains\na Hamiltonian circuit, but that there are situations where the number of faults is 4n\u2212 4 (and every\nprocessor is incident with at least two healthy links) and no Hamiltonian circuit exists.

The hypercube or, more precisely, the binary n-cube Bn\n(where n \u2265 2), is a popular interconnection network for parallel processing as it\npossesses a number of topological properties which are highly desirable in the con-\ntext of parallel processing: for example, it contains a Hamiltonian circuit; many\nother networks can be embedded into a binary n-cube; and its symmetry results in\nrich communication properties (see, for example, [3, 5, 8, 10, 12] and the references\ntherein).\nFault-tolerance in the binary n-cube is an important issue, given that many other\nnetworks can be embedded therein, and has been studied in a number of contexts.\nFor example, the ability of the binary n-cube to route and reconfigure itself in spite\nof faults has been considered (see the references in [8]), as has the embedding of\nHamiltonian circuits in binary n-cubes in the presence of faults [8]. In particular,\nChan and Lee [8] proved that a binary n-cube where at most 2n\u2212 5 links are faulty\nand where every node is incident with at least two healthy links (a natural assumption\nto make) has a Hamiltonian circuit, but that there exist binary n-cubes with 2n\u2212 4\nfaults (and where every node is incident with at least two healthy links) not containing\na Hamiltonian circuit. It is with an analogous version of this result that we are\nconcerned in this paper.\nOne drawback of the binary n-cube is that the number of links incident with\neach node is logarithmic in the number of nodes, and this causes problems with\nregard to current VLSI technology when the networks built upon the binary n-cube\ntopology involve a large number of processors. One means proposed to alleviate this\nproblem is to base networks on the topology of the k-ary n-cube Qkn (where k \u2265 3 and\nn \u2265 2). A network based on Qkn is such that each node is incident with 2n links, and\nconsequently k can be increased, in order to incorporate more processors, at the same\ntime keeping n constant. Moreover, \u201chigh-dimensional\u201d networks generally cost more\n\u2217Received by the editors October 28, 1996; accepted for publication (in revised form) March 22,\n2002; published electronically May 8, 2002.

ASHIR AND IAIN A. STEWART\nand run more slowly than \u201clow-dimensional\u201d networks, and it has also been shown\nthat low-dimensional networks achieve lower latency and better hot-spot throughput\nthan their high-dimensional counterparts [9, 11].\nThe properties of the k-ary n-cube Qkn relevant to parallel processing have not\nbeen determined to such an extent as those of the binary n-cube: however, some work\nhas been done (see, for example, [1, 2, 4, 6, 7]). In particular, it has been shown that\nQkn has a Hamiltonian circuit [6].\nIn this paper, we examine the number of link faults that a k-ary n-cube Qkn can\ntolerate so that there is still a Hamiltonian circuit. (Of course, we assume that every\nnode is incident with at least two healthy links.) In particular, we show that a k-ary\nn-cube Qkn where at most 4n\u22125 links are faulty and where every node is incident with\nat least two healthy links has a Hamiltonian circuit, but that there exist k-ary n-cubes\nwith 4n\u2212 4 faults (and where every node is incident with at least two healthy links)\nnot containing a Hamiltonian circuit. We also remark that the general problem of\ndeciding whether a faulty k-ary n-cube contains a Hamiltonian circuit is NP-complete\nfor all (fixed) k \u2265 3. Our results can be regarded as direct analogues of those in [8]\nfor k-ary n-cubes as opposed to binary n-cubes.\n2. Tolerating faults. Throughout this paper, we prefer to use the terminology\n\u201cnodes\u201d and \u201clinks\u201d as opposed to \u201cvertices\u201d and \u201cedges,\u201d for whilst the results in\nthis paper are entirely graph-theoretic, the use of \u201cnodes\u201d and \u201clinks\u201d accentuates the\nmotivational source of our research, i.e., the fault-tolerating capabilities of networks\nof processors when the faults which may occur are the failures of the links between\nprocessors in the network.\nThe binary n-cube, for n \u2265 2, can be represented as the set of 2n nodes {0, 1}n\nwhere there is a link joining nodes u and v if and only if u and v agree on all com-\nponents except one. Note that each node has degree n. The k-ary n-cube Qkn, for\nk \u2265 2 and n \u2265 2, can be represented as the set of kn nodes {0, 1, . . . , k \u2212 1}n where\nthere is a link joining nodes u and v if and only if u and v agree on all components\nexcept one, and on that component they differ by 1 modulo k. Note that each node\nhas degree 2n, when k \u2265 3, and n when k = 2. In particular, Q2n is simply Bn.\nFor each i \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , n}, we refer to all links whose incident nodes differ in the\nith component as lying in dimension i. Note that for any i \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , n}, Qkn consists\nof k disjoint copies of Qkn\u22121 where corresponding nodes are joined in circuits of length\nk using links in dimension i. When we consider Qkn in this way, with the disjoint\ncopies joined by links lying in dimension i, we say that we have partitioned Qkn over\ndimension i.\nLet us now proceed to the proof of our main theorem. This proof is by induction.\nWe begin by proving the inductive step, and then we return to the base cases of the\ninduction.\nTheorem 2.1. Let k \u2265 4 and n \u2265 2, or let k = 3 and n \u2265 3. If Qkn has at most\n4n\u22125 faulty links and is such that every node is incident with at least 2 healthy links,\nthen Qkn has a Hamiltonian circuit.\nProof. The proof proceeds by induction on n. We handle the base cases, when\nn = 2 and k \u2265 4 and when n = 3 and k = 3, later. As our induction hypothesis,\nassume that the result holds for Qkn, for some n \u2265 2 and for all k \u2265 4, or for some\nn \u2265 3 and k = 3. Let Qkn+1 have 4n\u22121 faults and be such that every node is incident\nwith at least two healthy links. Then there exists some dimension, say dimension 1,\nwhich contains at least three faults. We can partition Qkn+1 over dimension 1 and\nconsider Qkn+1 to consist of k disjoint copies Q1, Q2, . . . , Qk of Q\nk\nn with corresponding\nFAULT-TOLERANT EMBEDDINGS 319\n \n.\n.\n \n \n \n \n.\n.\n \n \n \n \n.\n.\n..\n..\n..\n..\nQ1 Q2 Qk\nFig. 2.1. The k copies of Qkn.\nnodes joined in circuits of length k, where the faults contained in Q1, Q2, . . . , Qk total\nat most 4n \u2212 4 (see Figure 2.1). Throughout this proof, if u is a node of Qi, say,\nthen we often denote it by ui, and we refer to its corresponding node in Qj as uj .\nOur general aim below is to argue, using induction, that Hamiltonian circuits exist in\neach of Q1, Q2, . . . , Qk and that we can \u201cjoin\u201d these circuits together using links in\ndimension 1 to obtain a Hamiltonian circuit in Qkn+1. (What we mean by \u201cjoin\u201d will\nbecome clear later: also, the general aim of connecting together circuits in Q1, Q2,\n. . ., Qk actually has to be more sophisticated in some scenarios.) Naturally, different\nscenarios arise according to the distribution of faulty links in Q1, Q2, . . . , Qk and in\ndimension 1. Another complication is that the chosen Hamiltonian circuit in Q2, for\nexample, might depend upon the Hamiltonian circuit chosen in Q1.\nCase (i). Each Qi is such that every node is incident with at least two healthy\nlinks and no Qi contains 4n\u2212 4 faults.\nWithout loss of generality (w.l.o.g.) we may assume that Q1 has most faults\nfrom amongst Q1, Q2, . . . , Qk. Hence, each of Q2, Q3, . . . , Qk has at most 2n \u2212 2\nfaults. By the induction hypothesis, Q1 has a Hamiltonian circuit C1. Following our\nbasic strategy, outlined above, we wish to find a Hamiltonian circuit Ck in Qk or a\nHamiltonian circuit C2 in Q2 so that we might \u201cjoin\u201d such a Hamiltonian circuit to\nC1 using healthy links in dimension 1. By \u201cjoin\u201d we mean replace a link (x1, y1) of\nC1 and the (corresponding) link (x2, y2) of C2, for example, with the links (x1, x2)\nand (y1, y2) in dimension 1. However, we must ensure that two mutually compatible\nlinks exist in C1 and C2 and also that the relevant dimension 1 links are healthy.\nWe begin by applying a counting argument to show that there exist links (x1, y1)\nand (y1, z1) of C1 such that either\n\u2022 (x2, y2), (y2, z2), (x1, x2), (y1, y2), and (z1, z2) are all healthy\nor\n\u2022 (xk, yk), (yk, zk), (x1, xk), (y1, yk), and (z1, zk) are all healthy.\nSuppose that it were otherwise. Then there would exist at least 2\u0007kn\/3\b faults not\nin Q1. (Split C1 into groups of three consecutive vertices and look at the links on\neither side in dimension 1 and in Q2 and Qk.) However, when n \u2265 2 and k \u2265 4 or\nwhen n \u2265 3 and k = 3, we have that 2\u0007kn\/3\b > 4n\u2212 1, which yields a contradiction.\nHence, w.l.o.g. we may assume that there exist links (x1, y1) and (y1, z1) of C1 such\nthat (x2, y2), (y2, z2), (x1, x2), (y1, y2), and (z1, z2) are all healthy.\n320 YAAGOUB A. ASHIR AND IAIN A. STEWART\nWhat we need to do now is to show that there is a Hamiltonian circuit C2 in Q2\ncontaining either (x2, y2) or (y2, z2): we can then join C1 and C2 as described above.\nSuppose that it were otherwise. If necessary, mark some of the links of Q2 incident\nwith y2 as faulty (that is, temporarily regard them as faulty) so that y2 is incident\nwith at most three healthy links in Q2, two of which are always (x2, y2) and (y2, z2).\nConsequently, as there were originally at most 2n \u2212 2 faulty links in Q2, there are\nnow at most 4n\u2212 5 faulty links. However, in order to apply our induction hypothesis\n(and deduce that this amended Q2 has a Hamiltonian circuit), we need that every\nnode in (the amended) Q2 is incident with at least two healthy links. Suppose that\nit were otherwise. Then there is a node w2 incident with exactly one healthy link.\nThis must have been because (y2, w2) was a healthy link in the original Q2 and it was\nsubsequently marked as faulty. Amend the marking of healthy links so that (w2, y2)\nis the third healthy link in the amended Q2. Note that in the amended marking\nevery node is incident with at least two healthy links (because Q2 originally had at\nmost 2n \u2212 2 faults). Now we can apply the induction hypothesis and deduce that\nQ2 has a Hamiltonian circuit C2 containing either (x2, y2) or (y2, z2) (possibly both).\nNo matter which, we can join C2 to C1 (as described above) to obtain a circuit D2\ncontaining every node of Q1 and Q2. (Henceforth, we now treat those links of Q2\nwhich were temporarily marked as faulty as being healthy again.)\nAll links of D2 except for (x1, x2) and (y1, y2) are links in Q1 or Q2. Hence, there\nis much potential to join D2, as above, to a Hamiltonian circuit in Q3 or Qk. Similarly\nto as before (by applying exactly the same counting argument), w.l.o.g. there exist\ntwo consecutive links (u2, v2) and (v2, w2) of D2 \u2229 Q2 such that the links (u3, v3),\n(v3, w3), (u2, u3), (v2, v3), and (w2, w3) are healthy. Again, by arguing exactly as\nbefore, there is a Hamiltonian circuit C3 in Q3 containing either the link (u3, v3) or\nthe link (v3, w3); and we can join D2 to C3 using links in dimension 1 to obtain a\ncircuit D3 containing all nodes of Q1, Q2, and Q3. Exactly the same arguments apply\nso that we might extend D3 to a circuit D4, containing all nodes of Q1, Q2, Q3, and\nQ4, and so on until we obtain a Hamiltonian circuit in Q\nn\nk+1.\nCase (ii). Each Qi is such that every node is incident with at least two healthy\nlinks and some Qj has exactly 4n\u2212 4 faults.\nW.l.o.g. we may assume that j = 1. Suppose that there is some fault (x1, y1) ofQ1\nsuch that (x1, x2) and (y1, y2) are healthy. Amend Q1 so that (x1, y1) is temporarily\nmarked as healthy. By the induction hypothesis applied to this amended Q1, there\nis a Hamiltonian circuit C1 which may or may not contain (x1, y1); and C1 is a\ncircuit in the original Q1. The circuit C1 has an isomorphic copy Ci in each Qi for\ni = 2, 3, . . . , k. If (x1, y1) is in C1, the circuit C1 can be joined to C2 using the\nhealthy links (x1, x2) and (y1, y2). Otherwise, because there are exactly three faults\nin dimension 1 and \u0007kn\/2\b > 3, there is a link (u1, v1) of C1 such that (u1, u2) and\n(v1, v2) are healthy. (Use a counting argument similar to that used before except split\nC1 into groups of two consecutive vertices and look at the pairs of links in dimension\n1 joining Q1 to Q2.) C1 can now be joined to C2 using these links to yield a circuit\nD2 containing every node of Q1 and Q2. The circuit D2 contains k\nn \u2212 1 links of Q2.\nAs \u0007(kn\u2212 1)\/2\b > 3, the same argument yields that there is a link (u2, v2) of D2 \u2229Q2\nsuch that the links (w3, z3), (w2, w3), and (z2, z3) are all healthy. Moreover, (w3, z3)\nlies on the circuit C3 of Q3. Hence, we can join D2 and C3 to obtain a circuit D3\ncontaining every node of Q1, Q2, and Q3. Exactly the same arguments apply so that\nwe can extend D3 to a Hamiltonian circuit of Q\nn\nk+1.\nOn the other hand, suppose that, for every fault (x1, y1) of Q1, at least one of\nFAULT-TOLERANT EMBEDDINGS 321\n(x1, x2) and (y1, y2), and at least one of (x1, xk) and (y1, yk), are faulty. Let (x1, y1)\nbe some fault of Q1. As there are exactly three faults in dimension 1, it cannot be\nthe case that two faults in Q1 are not incident with one another. Let us now count\nthe maximum number \u00b5 of faults of Q1 which could be incident with either x1 or y1.\nConsider x1. The number of faults incident with x1, apart from the fault (x1, y1), is\nat most 2n\u2212 3. Similarly, the number of faults incident with y1, apart from the fault\n(x1, y1), is at most 2n \u2212 3. Hence, \u00b5 \u2264 (2n \u2212 3) + (2n \u2212 3) + 1 = 4n \u2212 5. However,\nthere are 4n\u2212 4 faults in Q1 and so we obtain a contradiction.\nCase (iii). There exists some Qi in which there is a node incident with exactly\none healthy link in Qi.\nW.l.o.g. we may assume that the node x1 in Q1 is incident with exactly one\nhealthy link, (x1, y1), in Q1. As x1 is incident with 2n \u2212 1 faults in Q1, each Qi,\nfor i = 2, 3, . . . , k, contains at most 2n \u2212 3 faults; there is no node in any Qi, for\ni = 2, 3, . . . , k, which is incident with less than three healthy links in that Qi; and\napart from x1, there is no other node in Q1 which is incident with less than two\nhealthy links in Q1. Also, as x1 is incident with at least two healthy links in Q\nk\nn+1,\nwe may suppose that (x1, x2) is healthy. Consider w1, one of the 2n \u2212 1 potential\nneighbors of x1 in Q1 for which the link (x1, w1) is faulty. There are two scenarios.\nCase (iii)(a). (w1, w2) is a healthy link.\nMark the previously faulty link (x1, w1) as temporarily healthy. By the induction\nhypothesis applied to this amended Q1, there is a Hamiltonian path P1 from x1 to w1.\nMoreover, this Hamiltonian path P1 is a Hamiltonian path in the original Q1 (where\nthe links temporarily marked as faulty resume their healthy status).\nMark some of the previously healthy links in Q2 that are incident with x2 as\ntemporarily faulty and mark the link (x2, w2) as temporarily healthy (if necessary)\nso as to ensure that x2 is incident with exactly two healthy links in this amended\nQ2 (one of which is (x2, w2)). Note that in order to build this amended Q2 we have\nintroduced at most 2n \u2212 2 temporary faults; and so this amended Q2 has at most\n4n\u22125 faults and every node is incident with at least two healthy links. Hence, by the\ninduction hypothesis, there exists a Hamiltonian path P2 in this amended Q2 from\nx2 to w2. Moreover, this Hamiltonian path P2 is a Hamiltonian path in the original\nQ2. Join P1 and P2 using the healthy links (x1, x2) and (w1, w2) to form a circuit D2\nwhich contains all nodes of Q1 and Q2.\nApplying a counting argument similar to that used in Case (ii), along with the fact\nthat \u0007(kn\u22121)\/2\b > 2n (note that the total number of faults in Qkn+1 not contained in\nQ1 is at most 2n), there exists a link (u2, v2) of D2 \u2229Q2 such that the links (u3, v3),\n(u2, u3), and (v2, v3) are healthy. Temporarily mark healthy links in Q3 incident with\nu3 as faulty so that in this amended Q3, u3 is incident with exactly two healthy links,\none of which is (u3, v3). In order to build this amended Q3 we have introduced at\nmost 2n\u2212 2 temporary faults; and so this amended Q3 has at most 4n\u2212 5 faults and\nevery node is incident with at least two healthy links. By the induction hypothesis,\nthere is a Hamiltonian circuit C3 in the original Q3 containing the link (u3, v3). We\ncan join D2 and C3, using the healthy links (u2, u3) and (v2, v3), to obtain a circuit\nD3 containing every node of Q1, Q2, and Q3. Exactly the same argument can be\napplied to extend D3 to a circuit D4 and so on until we have a Hamiltonian circuit\nof Qkn+1.\nCase (iii)(b). All links from every such w1 to its corresponding node w2 in Q2\nare faulty.\nThis accounts for another 2n\u2212 1 faults in Qkn+1. Also, if (x1, xk) is healthy, then\n322 YAAGOUB A. ASHIR AND IAIN A. STEWART\nby symmetry we are in Case (iii)(a) (as all but at most one link of the form (w1, wk)\nis healthy). Hence, we may assume that (x1, xk) is faulty, and this accounts for all\nthe faults in Qkn+1.\nConsequently, (y1, y2) and (y1, yk) are both healthy links. (Recall that (x1, y1)\nis the only healthy link of Q1 incident with x1.) Let w1 be some potential neighbor\nof x1 in Q1 for which the link (x1, w1) is faulty. Amend Q1 by marking the link\n(x1, w1) as temporarily healthy. By the induction hypothesis applied to this amended\nQ1, there is a Hamiltonian path P1 in the original Q1 from x1 to w1. Rename the\nnodes of P1 as x1,1 = x1, x1,2 = y1, x1,3, . . . , x1,kn = w1, and note that in each Qi,\ni \u2265 2, there is a corresponding Hamiltonian path Pi which can be extended to a\nHamiltonian circuit Ci of Qi (as (xi, wi) is healthy in Qi). Rename the nodes of Ci\nas xi,1 = xi, xi,2 = yi, xi,3, . . . , xi,kn = wi for each i \u2265 2.\nFor ease of notation, denote kn by m. Suppose k is even. Then the following is a\nHamiltonian circuit in Qkn+1:\n(x1,1, x2,1, . . . , xk,1, xk,2, xk,3, x1,3, x1,4, . . . , x1,m, xk,m, xk\u22121,m, . . . , x2,m,\nx2,m\u22121, x3,m\u22121, . . . , xk,m\u22121, xk,m\u22122, xk\u22121,m\u22122, . . . , x2,m\u22122, x2,m\u22123,\nx3,m\u22123, . . . , xk,m\u22123, xk,m\u22124, . . . , xk,4, xk\u22121,4, . . . , x2,4, x2,3, x3,3, . . . ,\nxk\u22121,3, xk\u22121,2, xk\u22122,2, . . . , x2,2, x1,2, x1,1).\n(See Figure 2.2 where some of the healthy links between the Qi\u2019s are shown and bold\nlinks denote the links of the Hamiltonian circuit.) If k is odd, then the following is a\nHamiltonian circuit in Qkn+1:\n(x1,1, x2,1, . . . , xk,1, xk,2, xk\u22121,2, . . . , x2,2, x2,3, x3,3, . . . , xk,3, xk,4, xk\u22121,4, . . . ,\nx2,4, x2,5, . . . , x2,m, x3,m, . . . , x2,m, xk,m, . . . , x1,m, x1,m\u22121, . . . , x1,2, x1,1).\n(See Figure 2.3.)\nCase (iv). There exists some Qi in which there is a node incident with no healthy\nlinks in Qi.\nW.l.o.g. we may assume that x1 is incident with no healthy links in Q1. As x1 is\nincident with at least two healthy links in Qkn+1, the links (x1, x2) and (x1, xk) must\nbe healthy. There are at least 2n faults in Q1, and so there must be at most 2n \u2212 4\nfaults distributed amongst Q2, Q3, . . . , Qk. Hence, apart from x1, there are no nodes\nwhich are incident with less than four healthy links in their respective copy of Qkn.\nThe node x1 has 2n potential neighbors in Q1. Each of these potential neighbors\nis incident with a potential dimension 1 link to Q1 and a potential dimension 1 link to\nQk. (These dimension 1 links might be faulty.) As there are at most 2n\u2212 1 faults in\ndimension 1, there must exist potential neighbors y1 and z1 of x1 such that the links\n(y1, y2) and (z1, zk) are healthy. (Partition the potential neighbors into n pairs {y1, z1}\nand look at the pairs of dimension 1 links {(y1, y2), (z1, zk)} and {(y1, yk), (z1, z2)}.)\nMark the faulty links (x1, y1) and (x1, z1) as temporarily healthy in Q1. Applying\nthe induction hypothesis to this amended Q1, we obtain a path P1 in the original Q1\nfrom y1 to z1 upon which every node of Q1 appears exactly once, except for x1 which\ndoes not appear at all.\nBy marking previously healthy links inQ2 that are incident with x2 as temporarily\nfaulty, and by marking the link (x2, y2) as temporarily healthy (if necessary), ensure\nthat x2 is incident with exactly two healthy links in this amended Q2, one of which\nis (x2, y2). This involves introducing at most 2n\u2212 2 temporary faults into Q2; and so\nthe amended Q2 has at most 4n \u2212 6 faults and every node is incident with at least\nFAULT-TOLERANT EMBEDDINGS 323\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n..\n..\n..\n..\n..\n..\n..\n..\n....\n..\n..\n..\n..\n..\n..\n..\n..\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nQ1 Q2Qk\nP1 C2Ck\nx1,1\nx1,2\nx1,3\n.\n.\nx2,1\nx2,2\nx2,3\n.\n.\nxk,1\nxk,2\nxk,3\n.\n.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 2.2.

Likewise, there is a Hamiltonian path from xk to\nzk in Qk. Hence, let D2 be the circuit obtained by joining P1, P2, and Pk using the\nhealthy links (x1, x2), (y1, y2), (x1, xk), and (z1, zk).\nApplying a counting argument similar to that used in Case (ii), along with the\nfact that \u0007(kn \u2212 1)\/2\b > 2n \u2212 1 (note that the total number of faults in Qkn+1 not\ncontained in Q1 is at most 2n \u2212 1), there exists a link (u2, v2) of D2 \u2229 Q2 such that\nthe links (u3, v3), (u2, u3), and (v2, v3) are healthy. Temporarily mark healthy links in\nQ3 incident with u3 as faulty so that in this amended Q3, u3 is incident with exactly\ntwo healthy links, one of which is (u3, v3). In order to build this amended Q3 we\nhave introduced at most 2n \u2212 2 temporary faults; and so this amended Q3 has at\nmost 4n\u2212 6 faults and every node is incident with at least two healthy links. By the\ninduction hypothesis, there is a Hamiltonian circuit C3 in the original Q3 containing\nthe link (u3, v3). We can join D2 and C3, using the healthy links (u2, u3) and (v2, v3),\nto obtain a circuit D3 containing every node of Qk, Q1, Q2, and Q3. Exactly the\nsame argument can be applied to extend D3 to a circuit D4 and so on until we have\na Hamiltonian circuit of Qkn+1.\nIt remains to show that the result holds for the base cases of the induction, namely,\nwhen n = 2 and k \u2265 4, and when n = 3 and k = 3.\nLemma 2.2. If Qk2 , where k \u2265 4, has three faulty links and is such that every\nnode is incident with at least two healthy links, then Qk2 has a Hamiltonian circuit.\nProof.

All faults are in dimension 1.\nConsider the circuit Q1 of length k. As there are three faults in dimension 1,\nw.l.o.g. there exists an edge (x1, y1) of Q1 such that the links (x1, x2) and (y1, y2)\nare both healthy. (Apply our usual counting argument.) Join Q1 and Q2 using these\nlinks to obtain a circuit D2 containing every node of Q1 and Q2. By proceeding as\nwe have done throughout, the same argument can be used to extend D2 to (w.l.o.g.)\na circuit D3 and so on until we obtain a Hamiltonian circuit of Q\nk\n2 .\nCase (ii). Dimension 1 has exactly two faults.\nW.l.o.g. the only fault not in dimension 1 may be assumed to be (x1, y1) in Q1.\nIf the links (x1, x2) and (y1, y2) are both healthy or the links (x1, xk) and (y1, yk) are\nboth healthy, then we can join Q1 with Q2 or Qk, respectively, as in Case (i), and\nextend this circuit to a Hamiltonian circuit of Qk2 .\nHence, w.l.o.g. we may assume that the links (x1, x2) and (y1, yk) are both faulty.\nIf k is even, then there exists a Hamiltonian circuit in Qk2 as pictured in Figure 2.2. (In\nthat picture, x1,3, x1,2, x2,3, and xk,2 play the roles of x1, y1, x2, and yk, respectively.)\nIf k is odd, then there exists a Hamiltonian circuit in Qk2 as pictured in Figure 2.3.\n(In that picture, x1,m, x1,1, x2,m, and xk,1 play the roles of x1, y1, x2, and yk,\nrespectively.)\nLemma 2.3. If Q32 has three faulty links and is such that every node is incident\nwith at least two healthy links, then Q32 has a Hamiltonian circuit unless these three\nfaulty links form a circuit of length 3.\nFAULT-TOLERANT EMBEDDINGS 325\nProof. There exists some dimension, say dimension 1, that contains at least two\nfaults. Partition Q32 over dimension 1 to obtain three copies of Q\n3\n1, namely Q1, Q2, and\nQ3. We may assume that either Q1 contains one fault or all faults are in dimension\n1. Denote the nodes of Qi by xi, yi, and zi for i = 1, 2, 3.\nCase (i). Q1 contains one fault.\nW.l.o.g. we may assume that the fault in Q1 is (x1, y1).\nCase (i)(a). The links (x1, x2) and (y1, y2) are healthy.\nForm the circuit C = (x1, z1, y1, y2, z2, x2, x1) in Q\n3\n2. There are two possibilities:\neither one of the sets of pairs\n{(x1, x3), (z1, z3)}, {(y1, y3), (z1, z3)}, {(x2, x3), (z2, z3)}, {(y2, y3), (z2, z3)}\nconsists of two healthy links or the faulty links in dimension 1 are (z1, z3) and (z2, z3).\nIn the former case, the circuit C can be joined to the circuit (x3, y3, z3, x3) using the\npair of healthy links to obtain a Hamiltonian circuit in Q32: in the latter case, we can\ndefine our Hamiltonian circuit in Q32 to be (x1, z1, z2, y2, y1, y3, z3, x3, x2, x1).\nCase (i)(b). At least one of the links (x1, x2) and (y1, y2) is faulty.\nBy symmetry, we may also assume that at least one of (x1, x3) and (y1, y3) is\nfaulty (as otherwise we are in Case (i)(a)); so this accounts for all faults in Q32. The\nonly configuration possible, up to isomorphism, is that in Figure 2.4(a), and so there\nis a Hamiltonian circuit as depicted in that figure. (In Figure 2.4(a), the nodes x1,\ny1, and z1 of Q1 form the central column, with the other two columns similarly\ndepicting the nodes of Q2 and Q3. Faults are denoted by missing links, and links of\nthe Hamiltonian circuit are drawn in bold.)\nCase (ii). All faults are in dimension 1.\nUp to isomorphism, there are six different configurations possible, shown in Fig-\nure 2.4(b)\u2013(g), with Hamiltonian circuits as depicted except for Figure 2.4(g) where\nno such Hamiltonian circuit exists. (In Figure 2.4(g), w.l.o.g. the bold links are neces-\nsarily in any Hamiltonian circuit, if there were to exist one; and one can immediately\nsee that there is no extension of these bold links to a Hamiltonian circuit.)\nLemma 2.4. If Q33 has seven faulty links and is such that every node is incident\nwith at least two healthy links, then Q33 has a Hamiltonian circuit.\nProof. Case (i). Q33 contains faults forming a circuit C of length 3.\nAll of the faults in C must appear in the same dimension, say dimension 1.\nPartition Q33 across dimension 1 to obtain three copies of Q\n3\n2, namely Q1, Q2, and\nQ3, and let the faulty links in C be (x1, x2), (x2, x3), and (x3, x1). We may assume\nthat Q1 contains the most faults amongst these copies, then Q2, and then Q3.\nCase (i)(a). Q1 contains faults forming a circuit D of length 3.\nLet y1 and z1 be nodes of D different from x1 (x1 may or may not be on D) so\nthat the number of faults incident with y1 is no greater than the number of faults\nincident with any node of D different from x1. (Note that x1 is incident with at most\ntwo faults in Q1.) If y1 is incident with one healthy link in Q1, then every other node\nof Q1 is incident with at least two healthy links in Q1. (As Q\n3\n3 has seven faults, y1\nmust be incident with at least one healthy link in Q1.) In this case, temporarily mark\nthe link (y1, z1) as healthy so that there are at most three faults in the amended Q1.\n(And these faults do not form a circuit.) Lemma 2.3 yields that there is a Hamiltonian\npath in the original Q1 from y1 to z1.\nIf y1 is incident with two healthy links in Q1, then every node in Q1 is incident\nwith at least two healthy links in Q1. Mark the link (y1, z1) as temporarily healthy\nand a healthy link of Q1 incident with y1 as temporarily faulty. Every node in the\n326 YAAGOUB A. ASHIR AND IAIN A. STEWART\nno Hamiltonian\ncircuit!\n(b)(a) (c)\n(d) (e) (f)\n(g)\nFig. 2.4. The different configurations for Q32.\namended Q1 is incident with at least two healthy links, and there are at most three\nfaults. (And these faults do not form a circuit.) Lemma 2.3 yields that there is a\nHamiltonian path in the original Q1 from y1 to z1.\nWhichever of the above scenarios applies, denote the Hamiltonian path in Q1\nfrom y1 to z1 by P1. The faults in Q1 and the faults (x1, x2), (x2, x3), and (x3, x1)\naccount for at least six of the seven faults in Q33. Hence, w.l.o.g. we may assume\nthat the links (x1, x2) and (y1, y2) are healthy. There is at most one fault in Q2. By\nmarking healthy links of Q2 as temporarily faulty (if necessary), ensure that (y2, z2) is\nhealthy and y2 is incident with exactly two healthy links. Applying Lemma 2.3 to this\namended Q2 yields that there is a Hamiltonian circuit C2 (that is also a Hamiltonian\ncircuit in the original Q2) including the link (y2, z2). Join P1 and C2 using the healthy\nlinks (y1, y2) and (z1, z2) to obtain a circuit D2 containing every node of Q1 and Q2.\nQ3 has an isomorphic copy C3 of C2, and there are no faults in Q3. As C3 has\nlength 9 and there are at most four faults in dimension 1, by applying our counting\nargument as we have done throughout, we can join D2 and C3 using appropriate\ndimension 1 links to obtain a Hamiltonian circuit in Q33.\nCase (i)(b). Q1 does not contain faults forming a circuit D of length 3.\nNote that the proofs of Cases (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) of the main theorem hold for\nFAULT-TOLERANT EMBEDDINGS 327\nQ33 except that, throughout, instead of appealing to an inductive hypothesis, we use\nLemma 2.3; in Case (i), we assume that dimension 1 contains at most five faults; and\nin Case (iii)(a), when amending Q2 we must ensure that we do not introduce a circuit\nof faults of length 3. (This can be done as Q2 has at most 1 fault.) Consequently,\nwe are left with one scenario to consider: the subcase of Case (i) when each Qi is\nsuch that every node is incident with at least two healthy links and when dimension\n1 contains six or seven faults.\nLet (a new) 3-ary 2-cube Q32 be such that there is a fault (x, y) in Q\n3\n2 if and only\nif there is a fault (xi, yi) in Qi for some i \u2208 {1, 2, 3}. Then Q32 has at most two faults\nand, by Lemma 2.3, it has a Hamiltonian circuit C. For each i \u2208 {1, 2, 3}, let Ci\nbe the isomorphic copy of C in Qi. (Note that each Ci consists entirely of healthy\nlinks.) Even if dimension 1 (of our original Q33) contains seven faults, our usual\ncounting argument yields that there exists a pair of healthy links {(u1, u2), (v1, v2)}\nor {(u1, u3), (v1, v3)}, where (u1, v1) is a link of C1: w.l.o.g. we may assume that these\nhealthy links are (u1, u2) and (v1, v2). We can join C1 and C2 using these healthy links\nand then proceed similarly to join the resulting circuit to C3 and obtain a Hamiltonian\ncircuit of Q33.\nCase (ii). Q33 does not contain faults forming a circuit of length 3.\nThere exists a dimension, say dimension 1, containing at least three faults. Parti-\ntion Q33 across dimension 1 to obtain three copies of Q\n3\n2, namely Q1, Q2, and Q3. Let\nQ1 contain the most faults amongst these copies, then Q2, and then Q3. Proceeding\nas in Case (i)(b) yields the result.\nThe main theorem now follows by induction.\nThe result in Theorem 2.1 is optimal in the following sense. Let a, b, c, and d\nbe four nodes in Qkn, where k \u2265 4 and n \u2265 2, or k = 3 and n \u2265 3, such that there\nare links (a, b), (b, c), (c, d), and (d, a). Let the faults of Qkn consist of those links\nincident with a that are different from (a, b) and (a, d), and those links incident with\nc that are different from (b, c) and (c, d). In particular, Qkn has 4n\u22124 faults and every\nnode is incident with at least two healthy links; but this faulty Qkn does not contain\na Hamiltonian circuit, as any Hamiltonian circuit necessarily contains the links (a, b)\nand (a, d), and also the links (c, b) and (c, d), which yields a contradiction.\n3. Conclusions. We have proven that every k-ary n-cube Qkn which has at most\n4n\u22125 faulty links and is such that every node is incident with at least two healthy links\nhas a Hamiltonian circuit. As mentioned earlier, an analogous result for hypercubes\nwas proven by Chan and Lee [8]. In [8], it was also shown that the problem of\ndeciding whether a faulty binary n-cube has a Hamiltonian circuit is NP-complete.\nTheir complexity-theoretic reduction (from the 3-satisfiability problem) can easily be\nadapted to show that the problem of deciding whether a faulty k-ary n-cube has a\nHamiltonian circuit is also NP-complete. (We leave the proof of this as a simple\nexercise.)\nAs open problems relating to the research in this paper, we propose the following.\nThe construction of our Hamiltonian circuits in our faulty k-ary n-cubes does not yield\nefficient parallel distributed algorithms for actually building the Hamiltonian circuits.\nFor example, suppose one had a parallel computer whose underlying interconnection\nnetwork was a k-ary n-cube and each node, i.e., processor, had local (or even global)\nknowledge of the faulty links. How could we develop an efficient message-passing\nalgorithm so that, upon termination, every node knew its successor and predecessor\non a Hamiltonian circuit (without necessarily knowing the Hamiltonian circuit in its\nentirety)? Such an algorithm would be extremely useful. Also, whilst we provide a\n328 YAAGOUB A. ASHIR AND IAIN A. STEWART\nprecise result as to the threshold value on the number of faulty links occurring in a\nk-ary n-cube so that there still exists a Hamiltonian circuit (under the assumption\nthat every node is incident with at least two healthy links) and we also remark that\nthe general decision problem is NP-complete, it would be useful if \u201csafe patterns\u201d of\nfaults could be established so that even though there were more than 4n \u2212 5 faulty\nlinks present, one could still be sure of the existence of a Hamiltonian circuit because\nthese faults were arranged in some specific formation. Finally, we have addressed only\nthe problem of finding longest circuits in k-ary n-cubes in the presence of faulty links.\nIt would be interesting to do likewise in the presence of faulty nodes, or even faulty\nnodes and links.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Y.A.
