What then determines the distribu-\ntion and location of IF networks in cells? IFs are dynamic\nstructures, individually and collectively (Helfand et al.,\n2003). The composition of the IFs themselves is clearly a very\nimportant factor because that can influence the distribution\nof filaments (Cary and Klymkowsky, 1994a,b) and their\ndynamics (Chou et al., 2003) and the effect of some interme-\ndiate filament mutations (Zhou et al., 2003). The filament\ncomposition can also determine the spacing between fila-\nments, an important part of organizing individual filaments\ninto an ordered arrangement or network. So vimentin, but\nnot nestin, facilitates the correct spacing of glial fibrillary\nacidic protein filaments (Eliasson et al., 1999) and, of course,\naltering the proportion of the different neurofilament pro-\nteins changes the packing density of neurofilaments (Xu et\nal., 1996). Then, the provision of appropriate docking sites,\nfor instance on the plasma membrane (Borradori and Son-\nnenberg, 1999; Green and Gaudry, 2000; Garrod et al., 2002),\nas provided by members of the spectraplakin protein family\n(Leung et al., 2001; Roper and Brown, 2003) and also by some\nIF proteins themselves, such as syncoilin (Poon et al., 2002).\nIF composition and available attachment sites are therefore\nimportant factors in network formation.\nThis point has been firmly made for desmin. Although\nprevious in vitro assembly studies had shown that desmin\nwas very capable of forming 10-nm filaments in vitro (Herr-\nmann et al., 1999) and in vivo (Raats et al., 1990), the forma-\ntion of a network of desmin IFs is facilitated by the presence\nof other IF proteins such as keratins (Schweitzer et al., 2001),\nvimentin (Cary and Klymkowsky, 1994a,b; Schweitzer et al.,\n2001), paranemin (Schweitzer et al., 2001), and syncoilin\n(Poon et al., 2002). Indeed, paranemin cannot form filaments\nindependent of an appropriate assembly partner (Hemken et\nal., 1997) such as vimentin or desmin (Schweitzer et al., 2001).\nSyncoilin, on the other hand, does not participate directly in\nfilament assembly but is thought to be important in anchor-\ning desmin filaments to membrane attachment sites at the\nsarcolemma and neuromuscular junctions in muscle (Poon\net al., 2002). Keratins, too, influence the ability of desmin to\nform filament networks (Raats et al., 1990; Schweitzer et al.,\n2001), despite the fact that they do not seem to coassemble\nwith desmin (Hatzfeld and Franke, 1985), suggesting again\nthat the arrangement of assembled filaments into networks\ninvolves more than just the filament proteins themselves.

Recently, a missense mutation R120G\nin \u0001B-crystallin was confirmed as the genetic basis for a rare\nhuman desmin-related myopathy (Vicart et al., 1998), and this has\nbeen followed by two other \u0001B-crystallin mutations that also\ncause similar myopathies (Selcen and Engel, 2003). Although\nthese data support the previous hypothesis that small heat shock\nproteins (sHSPs) are important modulators of IF assemblies (Ni-\ncholl and Quinlan, 1994), it has been suggested for R120G \u0001B-\ncrystallin that the formation of the desmin aggregates may not be\ndue to a direct physical or biochemical interaction between\ndesmin and the mutant \u0001B-crystallin (Wang et al., 2001; Chavez\nZobel et al., 2003) but rather due to the loss of other \u0001B-crystallin\nfunctions such as their ability to inhibit apoptosis (Kamradt et al.,\n2002), interact with the transcriptional machinery in the nucleus\n(van den IJssel et al., 2003), influence genome stability (Andley et\nal., 2001), or play a role in proteosome function (den Engelsman et\nal., 2003). Direct evidence to show that \u0001B-crystallin directly con-\ntributes to desmin network formation is therefore still required as\na key step in understanding the biological basis of desmin-related\nmyopathy (DRM).\nIn the study presented here, we have used transient trans-\nfections and in vitro cosedimentation assays coupled with\nelectron microscopy to investigate the effects of the R120G\nmutation on the role of \u0001B-crystallin in desmin filament\nnetwork formation and maintenance. Together, our data\nsupport the hypothesis that it is the direct interaction be-\ntween the desmin filaments and the R120G \u0001B-crystallin that\ncauses desmin filament aggregates.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nExpression and Purification of Recombinant Wild-Type\nand Mutant \u0001B-Crystallin\nPlasmids containing wild-type and R120G \u0001B-crystallin in the pET23b vector\n(Novagen, Nottingham, United Kingdom) were constructed as described previ-\nously (Perng et al., 1999b). The expression constructs of both wild-type and\nmutant \u0001B-crystallin were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS\nstrain. Recombinant protein expression was induced using 0.5 mM isopropyl-1-\nthio-\u0002-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h once the bacterial culture had reached an\nOD600 of 0.6. The bacteria were harvested and resuspended in TEN buffer (50\nmM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM\nphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride [PMSF]) containing Complete protease inhibitor\ncocktail tablet (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) and lysed by several freeze\nand thaw cycles. Benzonase nuclease (Novagen) was added at a final concentra-\ntion of 10 U\/ml to the bacterial lysate and incubated at room temperature for 30\nmin. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm in a JA-20 rotor\n(Beckman Coulter, High Wycombe, United Kingdom) for 30 min at 4\u00b0C, followed\nby filtration through a 0.2-\u0003m filter (Whatman, Maidstone, United Kingdom).\nPolyethyleneimine (Sigma Chemical, Poole, Dorset, United Kingdom) was then\nadded to the filtrate to form a 0.06% solution. After incubation on ice for 5 min,\nthe mixture was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min to pellet the DNA.\nFor wild-type and R120G \u0001B-crystallin purification, the clear supernatant\nwas loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences UK,\nLittle Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) preequilibrated in buffer\nA (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM\ndithiothreitol [DTT], 0.2 mM PMSF) and eluted with a linear gradient of 0\u2013200\nmM NaCl in the same buffer. The \u0001B-crystallin\u2013enriched fractions were\npooled, concentrated, and further purified by size exclusion chromatography\non a Fractogel EMD BioSEC Superformance column (60 \u0001 1.6 cm; Merck\nSharp and Dohme, Hoddesdon, United Kingdom) equilibrated in buffer B (20\nmM Tri-HCl, 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.4). Purified proteins were concentrated by\nusing Ultrafree-15 concentrator (Millipore, Watford, United Kingdom) with a\n100-kDa molecular weight cut-off membrane.\nPreparation of Desmin\nPurified desmin was obtained by extraction of the crude intermediate filament\npreparation from chicken gizzards with 8 M urea and the subsequent chroma-\ntography on DEAE-cellulose (Whatman) and hydroxyapatite (Bio-Rad, Hemel\nHempstead, United Kingdom) columns in the presence of 6 M urea as described\nin detail previously (Geisler and Weber, 1980; Huiatt et al., 1980). Column\nfractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and those containing purified desmin\nwere collected, aliquoted, and stored at \u000280\u00b0C. Protein concentrations were\ndetermined by the bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA reagent; Perbio Science, Ches-\nter, United Kingdom) by using bovine serum albumin as standard.\nIn Vitro Assembly and Cosedimentation Assay\nIn vitro assembly and cosedimentation assay were carried out as described\npreviously (Perng et al., 1999a). Briefly, purified desmin in urea buffer (6 M\nurea, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.2 mM\nPMSF) was dialyzed by stepwise lowering of the urea concentration into low\nionic strength buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM DTT, 0.2 mM PMSF) at\n4\u00b0C. Wild-type or mutant \u0001B-crystallin was then mixed with desmin in low\nionic strength buffer at different molar ratios as indicated. Assembly of\ndesmin filaments in the presence or absence of \u0001B-crystallin was initiated by\naddition of a 20-fold concentrated assembly buffer to give a final concentra-\ntion of 100 mM imidazole-HCl, pH 6.8, 1 mM DTT, 0.2 mM PMSF. After\nincubation for 1 h at the indicated temperatures, protein samples were lay-\nered onto a 0.85 M sucrose cushion in the assembly buffer and centrifuged at\n80,000 \u0001 g for 30 min at 20\u00b0C in a TL-100 Bench Top centrifuge (Beckman\nCoulter) by using a TLS 55 rotor (Beckman Coulter) to pellet assembled\ndesmin filament and associated \u0001B-crystallin. To investigate the effect of\nR120G mutation upon aggregate formation in vitro, desmin was assembled in\nthe presence of wild-type or R120G \u0001B-crystallin and subjected to a low-speed\ncentrifugation at 3000 \u0001 g for 10 min in a Bench Top centrifuge (5417R;\nEppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). The pellet and supernatant fractions were\nseparated by 12% (wt\/vol) SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Blue\nstaining. The amount of protein in the supernatant and pellet fractions were\nanalyzed by a luminescent image analyser (LAS-1000plus; Fuji Film, Tokyo,\nJapan) and quantified using the Image Gauge software (version 4.0; Fuji Film),\nby using \u0001B-crystallin and desmin standards to determine protein amounts.\nThe binding curve of \u0001B-crystallin to desmin was determined by in vitro\ncosedimentation assay by using a fixed concentration of desmin and varying\nthe concentration range of \u0001B-crystallin. Scatchard analysis of these data was\nused to estimate the Kd for \u0001B-crystallin binding to desmin.\nElectron Microscopy\nProtein samples spread on carbon-coated copper grids were negatively\nstained with 1% (wt\/vol) uranyl acetate and examined by transmission\nelectron microscope (Phillips 400T), by using an accelerating voltage of 80 kV.\nImages were captured at a magnification of 17,000\u0001 on Kodak 4489 film and\nthen digitized at 1200 pixel2 resolution before being processed further in\nAdobe Photoshop 6 (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA).\nCell Cultures and Transient Transfection\nHuman adrenal cortex carcinoma cell SW13\/cl.2 (kindly provided by Dr.\nRobert Evans, University of Colorado Health Sciences Centre, Denver, CO),\nhuman breast cancer epithelial cell MCF7, and human lens epithelial cell\nH36CE2 (Porter et al., 1998) were grown in DMEM (Sigma Chemical), sup-\nplemented with 10% (vol\/vol) fetal calf serum (Sigma Chemical), 2 mM\nl-glutamine, and antibiotics (100 U of penicillin and 0.1 mg of streptomycin).\nBaby hamster kidney (BHK21) fibroblasts were grown in Glasgow minimal\nessential medium (Sigma Chemical) supplemented with 5% (vol\/vol) tryp-\ntose phosphate broth, 5% (vol\/vol) fetal calf serum, and antibiotics (100 U of\npenicillin and 0.1 mg\/ml streptomycin). All cells were maintained at 37\u00b0C in\na humidified incubator of 95% (vol\/vol) air and 5% (vol\/vol) CO2.\nWild-type and R120G \u0001B-crystallin were subcloned into a mammalian\nexpression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen, Paisley, United Kingdom) from the\nbacterial expression vectors using NdeI and EcoRI restriction sites. For trans-\nfection experiments, plasmid DNA containing human desmin (kindly pro-\nvided by Dr. H. Herrmann, German Cancer Research Centre, Heidelberg,\nGermany), wild-type, and R120G \u0001B-crystallin in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) was\nprepared using MaxiPrep kits (QIAGEN, Dorking, Surrey, United Kingdom).\nCells grown on 13-mm coverslips at a density of 50\u201360% confluence were\ntransiently transfected with wild-type or R120G \u0001B-crystallin alone or co-\ntransfected with desmin by GeneJuice transfection reagent (Novagen) accord-\ning to manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Cells were allowed to recover for 48 h before\nprocessing for immunofluorescence microscopy. In some experiments, cells\nwere treated with colcemid (Sigma Chemical) at a final concentration of 10\n\u0003M for 16 h. For observations on recovery from colcemid treatment, cells were\nrinsed and transferred to normal growth medium for up to 24 h.\nIndirect Immunofluorescence Microscopy\nFor immunofluorescence studies, cells were washed twice with phosphate-\nbuffered saline (PBS) and fixed with ice-cold methanol\/acetone [1:1 (vol\/vol)]\nfor 20 min at room temperature, and washed twice with PBS containing 0.02%\nM.D. Perng et al.\nMolecular Biology of the Cell2336\n(wt\/vol) sodium azide and 0.02% (wt\/vol) bovine serum albumin (BSA)\n(PBS\/BSA\/azide). Cells were then preblocked with 10% (vol\/vol) goat serum\nin PBS\/BSA\/azide for 20 min, washed three times in PBS\/BSA\/azide, and\nthen incubated with primary antibodies at room temperature for 1 h. The\nprimary antibodies used in this study were mouse monoclonal antidesmin\n(1:100; D33; DakoCytomation, Ely, Cambridgeshire, United Kingdom), mono-\nclonal anti-HSP27 (1:100; King et al., 1987), monoclonal anti-\u0001B-crystallin (1:1;\nSawada et al., 1993), and rabbit polyclonal antidesmin (1:100; Sigma Chemi-\ncal). After washing with PBS\/BSA\/azide, the primary antibodies were de-\ntected using fluorescein isothiocyanate- (1:100; Jackson ImmunoResearch Lab-\noratories, West Grove, PA) or Alexa 594 (1:800; Molecular Probes, Eugene,\nOR)-conjugated secondary antibodies. All antibodies were diluted in PBS\/\nBSA\/azide buffer before use. The glass coverslips were mounted on slides\nwith the fluorescent protecting agent Citifluor (Citifluor Labs, London, United\nKingdom) and observed with an Axioplan fluorescence microscope (Carl\nZeiss, Jena, Germany) by using a 63\u0001 Plan-Apochromat 1.4 numerical aper-\nture objective. Images were obtained through a cooled charge-coupled device\ncamera (Digital Pixel, Brighton, United Kingdom) running IP Lab software.\nAlternatively, images were collected using an LSM 510 confocal laser scan-\nning microscope (Carl Zeiss). Optical sections were set to \u00031.0 \u0003m. Images\nwere processed and prepared for figures using Adobe Photoshop 7 (Adobe\nSystems). Quantitation of the desmin filament phenotypes was by visual\nassessment of the cells and scoring as cells with or without desmin containing\naggregates. In cotransfection experiments, only those cells expressing both\ndesmin and \u0001B-crystallin were counted. Approximately 100\u2013150 transfected\ncells were assessed and the experiment repeated at least three times.\nCell Fractionation and Immunoblotting\nCells plated on 75-cm2 flask were washed twice with PBS before being lysed\nwith 1 ml of extraction buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM\nEDTA, 0.5% (vol\/vol) Triton X-100] containing 1 mM PMSF and Complete\nprotease inhibitor cocktail tablet (Roche Diagnostics). After incubation on ice\nfor 10 min, cell lysates were removed from flasks and homogenized in a 1 ml\nof Dounce homogenizer. The homogenates were clarified by centrifugation at\n18,000\u0001 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C in a precooled Bench Top centrifuge (Eppendorf).\nThe resulting supernatant and pellet fractions were equalized by adding\nappropriate volumes of Laemmli\u2019s sample buffer (Laemmli, 1970) before\nSDS-PAGE and immunoblotting analysis.\nImmunoblotting was performed using the semidry blotting method accord-\ning to the manufacturer\u2019s specifications (Bio-Rad). After blotting, protein\ntransfer was assessed by Ponceau S (Sigma Chemical) staining of the nitro-\ncellulose membrane followed by destaining in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 20\nmM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl). After incubation with blocking solution\nconsisting of 5% (wt\/vol) dried milk powder (Marvel, Tesco Ltd., Chestnut,\nHerts, United Kingdom) in TBS containing 0.2% (vol\/vol) Tween 20 for 2 h,\nthe membranes were probed with a panel of antibodies, including mouse\nmonoclonal anti-HSC70 (Hopwood et al., 1997), monoclonal anti-HSP27 (ER-\nD5), monoclonal antidesmin (D33; DakoCytomation), monoclonal anti-actin\n(AC-40; Sigma Chemical), rabbit polyclonal anti-vimentin (3052), and poly-\nclonal anti-\u0001B-crystallin (3148) antibodies diluted to 1:1000 in blocking solu-\ntion for 1 h. After several washes with TBS containing 0.2% (vol\/vol) Tween\n20, the membrane was incubated in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sec-\nondary antibodies (DakoCytomation) diluted 1:1000 in blocking solution for\n1 h, followed by washing with TBS for 30 min. Antibody labeling was\ndetected by enhanced chemiluminescence using a luminescent image anal-\nyser (LAS-1000plus; Fuji Photo Film (UK), London, United Kingdom).\nRESULTS\nThe R120G mutation in \u0001B-crystallin caused cytoplasmic\naggregates containing desmin IFs and \u0001B-crystallin in mus-\ncle cells of affected individuals (Vicart et al., 1998). Structural\nstudies have confirmed that the R120G mutation in \u0001B-\ncrystallin results in altered secondary, tertiary, and quater-\nnary structure, decreased protein stability and compromised\nchaperone function (Bova et al., 1999; Kumar et al., 1999;\nPerng et al., 1999b). Using several in vitro assays, we deter-\nmined the effects of R120G mutant upon the interaction with\nastrocyte-specific IF protein; glial fibrillary acidic protein\nhad been studied previously (Perng et al., 1999b). These\nresults suggested that the major histopathological feature of\nthe disease, namely, desmin aggregates, could result from\nan altered interaction between \u0001B-crystallin and desmin. To\nFigure 1. Formation of cytoplasmic aggre-\ngates by R120G \u0001B-crystallin in BHK21 cells.\nBHK21 cells (A\u2013C) transiently transfected\nwith either wild-type (D\u2013F) or R120G (G\u2013I)\n\u0001B-crystallin were fixed at 48 h posttransfec-\ntion and processed for immunofluorescence\nmicroscopy as described in MATERIALS\nAND METHODS. Subcellular distribution of\n\u0001B-crystallin and desmin were visualized by\ndouble labeling with monoclonal anti-desmin\nand polyclonal anti-\u0001B-crystallin antibodies.\nThe immunofluorescence for \u0001B-crystallin is\nin the green channel (D and G), whereas the\ncounterstaining for desmin is in the red chan-\nnel (E and H). Merged images show the su-\nperimposition of the green and red signals\nwith areas of overlap in yellow (F and I).\nImages were acquired by a confocal laser\nscanning microscope. Untransfected cells re-\nvealed extended desmin filament networks\ndistributed throughout the cytoplasm (B), but\nno \u0001B-crystallin signal can be detected (A).\nCells expressing wild-type \u0001B-crystallin\nshowed cytoplasmic distribution of \u0001B-crys-\ntallin (D) and desmin (E). In contrast, cells\nexpressing R120G \u0001B-crystallin resulted in\nthe formation of cytoplasmic aggregates that\nare immuno-positive for both \u0001B-crystallin\n(G) and desmin (H). Notice that desmin-pos-\nitive signals were distributed outside, but not\nwithin, the aggregates (I). Bars, 10 \u0003m.\nDesmin Aggregates by R120G \u0001B-Crystallin\nVol. 15, May 2004 2337\ntest this hypothesis in vivo, a mammalian expression vector\ncontaining R120G \u0001B-crystallin was generated and used to\ntransfect in BHK21 cells. These cells were selected because\nthey express both vimentin and desmin (Figure 1B) and\ncontain little \u0001B-crystallin (Figure 1A). This cell line there-\nfore provides an opportunity to test the ability of transfected\n\u0001B-crystallin constructs to affect the organization of the en-\ndogenous desmin filament networks.\nBHK21 cells transfected with either wild-type or R120G\n\u0001B-crystallin were fixed at 48 h posttransfection and pro-\ncessed for double label immunofluorescence microscopy to\ndetermine the distribution of \u0001B-crystallin in relation to the\nendogenous desmin filament networks. Cells transfected\nwith wild-type \u0001B-crystallin showed a cytoplasmic distribu-\ntion (Figure 1D) that is partially coaligned with bundles of\ndesmin filaments (Figure 1E). In contrast, the majority of\ncells transfected with R120G \u0001B-crystallin form perinuclear\naggregates (Figure 1G). These aggregates were not obvi-\nously desmin positive (Figure 1, H and I), although desmin\nfilaments were usually around the periphery of these aggre-\ngates. These data show that transfected R120G \u0001B-crystallin\nleads to protein aggregate formation and the localized reor-\nganization of desmin filament. These observations are in\nagreement with previously published data where desmin\nfilaments also seemed to engulf the R120G \u0001B-crystallin\naggregates in transfected BHK21 cells (Vicart et al., 1998).\nTo assess the relative expression levels and subcellular distri-\nbutions of wild-type and R120G \u0001B-crystallin in the presence of\ndesmin filaments, BHK21 cells were transfected with\u0001B-crystallin\nconstructs before cell fractionation studies. Pellet and supernatant\nfractions were prepared and then probed with antibodies to\ndesmin (Figure 2A) and \u0001B-crystallin (Figure 2B). BHK21 cells\nexpress very low levels of endogenous \u0001B-crystallin as shown by\nthe immunoblot analysis of untransfected cells (Figure 2B, lanes 1\nand 2). Transfection of BHK21 cells with either wild-type or\nR120G \u0001B-crystallin resulted in the good expression of both pro-\nteins (Figure 2B, lanes 3\u20136). Whereas transfected wild-type \u0001B-\ncrystallin was found almost entirely in the soluble fraction (Figure\n2B, lane 3), with only a small proportion present in the pellet\nfraction (Figure 2B, lane 4), a significant proportion (\u000350%) of the\nR120G \u0001B-crystallin was recovered in the pellet fraction (Figure\n2B, lane 6) of transfected cells. As expected, the endogenous\ndesmin in BHK21 cells was found exclusively in the pellet fraction\nof both untransfected (Figure 2A, lane 2, labeled P) and trans-\nfected cells (Figure 2A, lanes 4 and 6, labeled P). Equal protein\nloading for each supernatant (Figure 2C, lanes 1, 3, and 5, labeled\nS) and pellet (Figure 2C, lanes 2, 4, and 6, labeled P) fractions were\nconfirmed by immunoblotting for actin. These data support the\nproposed association between R120G \u0001B-crystallin and desmin\nintermediate filaments and this association in turn could contrib-\nute directly to the reorganization of the desmin filament network\nseen in the R120G \u0001B-crystallin transfected BHK21 cells.\nThe Effect of R120G Mutation upon the Interaction with\nDesmin Filaments In Vitro\nCosedimentation assays were used to investigate whether\nwild-type and R120G \u0001B-crystallin interacted differently\nwith desmin filaments. In these assays, the distribution of\ndesmin and \u0001B-crystallin between supernatant and pellet\nfractions was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomas-\nsie Blue staining and densitometry to determine protein\nlevels. Under the conditions of the assay, desmin assembled\nefficiently and sedimented into the pellet fraction (Figure 3A,\nlanes 8, 10 and 12, labeled P) at all selected temperatures\nwith very little (\u0004 5%) detectable desmin left in the super-\nnatant fractions (Figure 3A, lanes 7, 9, and 11, labeled S).\nIn contrast, only \u000310% of either wild-type or R120G \u0001B-\ncrystallin self-aggregated and was found in the pellet\nfraction (Figure 3, A and C, lanes 2, 4, and 6, respectively).\nWhen desmin and \u0001B-crystallins were mixed at a 1:1\nmolar ratio, both the wild-type (Figure 3A) and R120G\n\u0001B-crystallin (Figure 3C) cosedimented with desmin fila-\nments in a temperature-dependent manner. At 22, 37, and\n44\u00b0C, 8, 44, and 71%, respectively, of wild-type \u0001B-crys-\ntallin (Figure 3B) compared with 30, 88, and 100%, respec-\ntively, of the R120G \u0001B-crystallin (Figure 3D) cosedi-\nmented with desmin filaments. The R120G mutation\ntherefore apparently increased the binding of \u0001B-crystal-\nlin to desmin filaments at all temperatures, and although\nthis binding seemed to be still temperature dependent, it\nwas significantly greater than the maximum observed for\nwild-type \u0001B-crystallin. In fact, at a 1:1 ratio the binding\nof R120G \u0001B-crystallin was 100% at 44\u00b0C.\nBinding curves for the interaction between either wild-\ntype or R120G \u0001B-crystallin with desmin were determined\nby measuring the ratio of bound to unbound \u0001B-crystallin to\ndesmin at 37\u00b0C. These ratios were calculated by measuring\nprotein levels in the pellet and supernatant fractions ob-\ntained from the in vitro cosedimentation assays and were\ndetermined over the molar concentration range from 0.25:1\nto 6:1 (Figure 4A). Representative in vitro sedimentation\ndata are shown in Figure 3, A and C. Scatchard analysis of\nthe binding curve data (Figure 4B) estimated the dissociation\nconstant (Kd) for wild-type \u0001B-crystallin as 2.45 \u0003M, but\nsignificantly this was reduced to 1.13 \u0003M for R120G \u0001B-\nFigure 2. Immunoblotting analysis of \u0001B-crystallin expressed in\nBHK21 cells. BHK21 cells were either untransfected (lanes 1 and 2)\nor transfected with wild-type (lanes 3 and 4) or R120G \u0001B-crystallin\n(lanes 5 and 6). At 48 h posttransfection, cells were extracted with\ndetergent buffer followed by centrifugation at 18,000 \u0001 g for 15 min\nat 4\u00b0C. The resulting supernatant (S) and pellet (P) fractions were\nseparated by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting analysis by\nusing anti-desmin (A) and \u0001B-crystallin (B) antibodies. The blot was\ndeveloped by enhanced chemiluminescence system. Whereas wild-\ntype \u0001B-crystallin was present almost entirely in the soluble fraction\n(B, lane 3, labeled S), \u000350% of R120G \u0001B-crystallin was found in the\npellet fraction (B, lane 6, labeled P). Desmin immuno-positive sig-\nnals were detected exclusively in the pellet fractions (A, lanes 2, 4,\nand 6, labeled P). Equal loading of each supernatant and pellet\nfraction was confirmed by monitoring actin levels by immunoblot-\nting with anti-actin antibody (C).\nM.D. Perng et al.\nMolecular Biology of the Cell2338\ncrystallin. These binding data also confirm that desmin fil-\naments can potentially bind much more R120G than wild-\ntype \u0001B-crystallin, which is in part due to a decreased Kd.\nTo visualize the in vitro association of \u0001B-crystallin with\ndesmin filaments, samples from the in vitro assembly were\nnegatively stained with uranyl acetate and examined by\nelectron microscopy. At 37\u00b0C, desmin assembled into fila-\nments that were several micrometers in length either in the\nabsence (Figure 5A) or presence of \u0001B-crystallin (Figure 5, B\nand C). Under these assembly conditions, the presence of\neither wild-type (Figure 5B) or R120G \u0001B-crystallin (Figure\n5C) did not dramatically change the length of desmin fila-\nments. Electron microscopy showed that desmin filaments\nin the presence of R120G \u0001B-crystallin were heavily deco-\nrated (Figure 5C, arrows) compared with wild-type \u0001B-\ncrystallin (Figure 5B, arrows). These observations therefore\ncorrelated very well with the in vitro binding results (Figure\n3) and their analysis (Figure 4), leading to the conclusion\nthat the R120G mutation significantly increases the binding\nof \u0001B-crystallin to desmin filaments.\nOne of the consequences of this increased binding could\nbe increased interfilament interactions mediated via R120G\n\u0001B-crystallin. To test this hypothesis, a low-speed centrifu-\ngation assay was developed to monitor the extent of fila-\nment\u2013filament interactions after assembly is complete (Pol-\nlard and Cooper, 1982; Ma et al., 2001). In the presence of\nR120G \u0001B-crystallin, nearly all (96%) the desmin filaments\nwere found in the pellet fraction along with 76% of the\nR120G \u0001B-crystallin (Figure 6, lane 6, labeled P). By com-\nparison, only 60% of those desmin filaments assembled in\nthe presence of the wild-type \u0001B-crystallin were pelleted\nunder similar centrifugation conditions (Figure 6, lane 4,\nlabeled P) and in this case 63% of the wild-type \u0001B-crystallin\nremained in the supernatant (Figure 6, lane 3, labeled S). We\ninterpret these data to suggest that the increased association\nof R120G \u0001B-crystallin with the desmin filaments promotes\nmore filament\u2013filament interactions as seen by the more\nefficient filament sedimentation in this assay.\nCotransfection of Wild-Type \u0001B-Crystallin Assists the\nFormation of Desmin Filament Networks, but R120G\n\u0001B-Crystallin Prevents This Beneficial Effect\nOur initial studies with BHK21 cells investigated the effect\nof R120G \u0001B-crystallin upon established desmin net-\nworks. Although important, it is also necessary to con-\nsider the effect of wild-type and mutant \u0001B-crystallin\nupon de novo desmin filament network formation. For\nthis purpose, we developed a new transfection assay\nbased on the cotransfection of \u0001B-crystallin with desmin\nFigure 3. Cosedimentation of wild-type and R120G \u0001B-crystallin with desmin filaments in vitro. Desmin was assembled with additions of\neither wild-type (A and B) or R120G \u0001B-crystallin (C and D) at a molar ratio of 1:1 at indicated temperatures. The supernatant (S) and pellet\n(P) fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. The amounts of \u0001B-crystallin and desmin in the supernatant\nand pellet fractions were quantified as described in MATERIALS AND METHODS. Representative gels from the cosedimentation assay are\nshown (A and C). The positions of desmin, wild-type and R120G \u0001B-crystallin are indicated. Under these assay conditions, desmin assembled\nefficiently and more than 95% of the proteins were found in the pellet fractions (A and C; lanes 8, 10, and 12, labeled P). In the absence of\ndesmin, both the wild-type and R120G \u0001B-crystallin remained mostly in the supernatant (A and C; lanes 1, 3, and 5, labeled S) with only\n\u000310% being sedimented into the pellet fractions (A and C; lanes 2, 4, and 6, labeled P). When desmin was included in the assay, both the\nwild-type (A) and R120G \u0001B-crystallin (C) cosedimented with desmin filaments in a temperature-dependent manner because increasing\nproportions of \u0001B-crystallin were found in the pellet fractions at elevated temperatures. The R120G \u0001B-crystallin apparently cosedimented\nmore efficiently than wild-type protein at all selected temperatures (cf. A and C), suggesting an increased binding of R120G \u0001B-crystallin to\ndesmin. Quantification results from three independent experiments are shown as mean \u0005 SE and presented as bar charts (B and D).\nDesmin Aggregates by R120G \u0001B-Crystallin\nVol. 15, May 2004 2339\nand scoring double-transfected cells for the presence of\ndesmin-positive aggregates (Table 1).\nFor such an assay, it is important to determine the endog-\nenous expression levels of \u0001B-crystallin in these cells and of\na closely related protein HSP27 because both proteins cannot\nonly bind to and modulate intermediate filament assemblies\n(Nicholl and Quinlan, 1994; Perng et al., 1999a) but also they\ncan prevent the aggregation of R120G \u0001B-crystallin in trans-\nfected cells (Chavez Zobel et al., 2003; Ito et al., 2003).\nThree cell lines were selected and the expression levels of the\nsmall heat shock proteins \u0001B-crystallin and HSP27 were deter-\nmined (Figure 7). Equal protein loading per lane was verified\nusing the house-keeping protein HSC70 (Figure 7A, lanes 1\u20133).\nMCF7 and SW13\/cl.2 cells have both been used before in the\nstudy of desmin network formation (Schweitzer et al., 2001). A\nhuman lens epithelial cell line H36 was selected because it\nexpressed both sHSPs (Figure 7, C and D, lane 1), whereas\nSW13\/cl.2 (Figure 7C, lane 2) and MCF7 cells (Figure 7C, lane\n3) only expressed HSP27. None of the cells expressed desmin\n(our unpublished data) and only the H36 cell line expressed\nvimentin (Figure 7B, lane 1). Vimentin is a natural assembly\npartner for desmin (Quinlan and Franke, 1982; Schweitzer et al.,\n2001) and in a rat model of cataractogenesis, desmin can be\nexpressed in lens epithelial cells (Lovicu et al., 2002) showing\nthat desmin transfection in these cells is still a mimic of a\nphysiologically important situation.\nMCF7 cells express keratins (K8, 18, and 19), but not type III\nIFs (Figure 7B; Schweitzer et al., 2001). Despite the lack of a type\nIII assembly partner, desmin was still able to form extensive\nfilament networks in most (87%; Table 1) of the transfected cells\n(Figure 8C), which is consistent with previous studies (Raats et\nal., 1990; Schweitzer et al., 2001). Cotransfection of desmin with\nwild-type \u0001B-crystallin had no obvious effect on desmin fila-\nment networks (Figure 8F and Table 1). In contrast, the R120G\nmutant had a dramatic effect on desmin filament organization\nwhen cotransfected with desmin. More than one-half of the\ntransfected cells (55%; Table 1) contained ring-like perinuclear\ndesmin aggregates (Figure 8I), which are morphologically dis-\ntinct compared with the other cell lines (see below). These data\nconfirm the dominant effect of R120G \u0001B-crystallin upon ag-\ngregate formation.\nWe then selected another cell line, SW13\/cl.2 cells, that do\nnot contain vimentin (Figure 7B) or any other cytoplasmic\nintermediate filaments (Sarria et al., 1990) to examine the\neffect of \u0001B-crystallin upon de novo filament network for-\nmation in this cell background. In agreement with previous\npublished results (Schweitzer et al., 2001), desmin formed\ncytoplasmic aggregates with some filaments and short rod-\nlike structures in these cells (Figure 8B). Transfection of\nthese cells with desmin and wild-type \u0001B-crystallin de-\ncreased the formation of aggregates (Figure 8E) from 62 to\n41% (Table 1). In contrast, cells cotransfected with desmin\nand R120G \u0001B-crystallin led to densely packed aggregates\nwithout any detectable filamentous staining (Figure 8H),\nagain suggestive of a dominant effect when compared with\nwild-type \u0001B-crystallin.\nDesmin was then cotransfected into H36 cells with ei-\nther wild-type (Figure 8D) or R120G \u0001B-crystallin (Figure\n8G). Despite the presence of \u0001B-crystallin and HSP27\n(Figure 7, C and D), the transfection of desmin alone\nresulted in a strong tendency to form aggregates (87%) in\nFigure 4. Binding of wild-type and R120G \u0001B-crystallin to desmin\nfilaments. (A) Binding curve defining the interaction between\ndesmin and \u0001B-crystallin. In vitro cosedimentation assay was car-\nried out at 37\u00b0C by using a range of concentrations of \u0001B-crystallin:\ndesmin from 0.25:1 to 6:1. The amount of proteins in the supernatant\n(S) and pellet (P) fractions was quantified as described in MATERI-\nALS AND METHODS.

The Kd of \u0001B-crystallin and desmin interaction\nwas obtained by converting the data as bound\/free versus bound of\n\u0001B-crystallin to desmin. The R120G mutant displayed a higher\nbinding affinity (Kd \u0006 1.14 \u0003M) for desmin compared with wild-\ntype \u0001B-crystallin (Kd \u0006 2.37 \u0003M).\nTable 1.

Cells immuno-positive\nfor both the transfected \u0001B-crystallin and desmin were scored for\nthe presence of desmin-positive aggregates. The mean and standard\ndeviation is shown as percentage\u0005 SE and represents an average of\nthree independent experiments. The transfection efficiency was sim-\nilar for each experiment and ranged from 10 to 20%. For each\nexperiment, \u0003100\u2013150 cells were counted in random fields. Cells\ntransfected only with desmin (none) was used as the control for\nthese experiments.\nM.D. Perng et al.\nMolecular Biology of the Cell2340\nthese lens cells (Figure 8A). The ectopic overexpression of\nwild-type \u0001B-crystallin seemed to significantly reduce\nthis tendency (Figure 8D), whereas the expression of\nR120G \u0001B-crystallin was unable to increase upon an al-\nready high incidence of aggregate formation (Figure 8G)\nwhen cotransfected with desmin (Table 1). From these\ndata, two important observations emerge. First, it is clear\nthat \u0001B-crystallin can have a beneficial influence upon\ndesmin filament assemblies. Second, the R120G mutation\nin \u0001B-crystallin significantly inhibited this positive effect\nof wild-type \u0001B-crystallin and indeed seemed to encour-\nage desmin aggregate formation in all three different cel-\nlular backgrounds (Figure 8, G\u2013I).\nThese data show that the network assembly status of desmin\ncan greatly influence the effect of R120G \u0001B-crystallin. These\ndata show the effects of R120G \u0001B-crystallin are not best seen\nwhen filament networks are in status quo, but rather when\nthey are subjected to changes such as the formation of new\nnetworks or substantial rearrangements of existing networks.\nTo mimic better this type of situation for preformed desmin\nnetworks, IF respreading after drug-induced collapse and re-\ncovery was used as an experimental model.\nColcemid has a well documented disrupting effect on cy-\ntoskeletal networks. The primary effect of the drug is to cause\nmicrotubule depolymerization, but after longer exposure to the\ndrug the intermediate filament network collapses as a second-\nary effect. These effects are reversible by incubation of the cells\nin colcemid-free culture medium (Goldman et al., 1979). BHK21\ncells were transfected with either wild-type (Figure 9, A\u2013F) or\nR120G (Figure 9, G\u2013L) \u0001B-crystallin and then treated for 16 h\nwith 10 \u0003M colcemid (Figure 9, A\u2013C and G\u2013I). This treatment\ncauses the collapse of the desmin IF networks and their accu-\nmulation in the perinuclear region of the cells (Figure 9, B and\nH) where wild-type (Figure 9A) and R120G (Figure 9G) \u0001B-\ncrystallin are also concentrated. After 4 h of recovery (Figure 9,\nD\u2013F and J\u2013L), most of the desmin networks in cells expressing\nwild-type \u0001B-crystallin had recovered (Figure 9E), but this was\nnot the case in cells transfected with R120G \u0001B-crystallin (Fig-\nure 9K). The filament aggregates and bundles were also im-\nmuno-positive for \u0001B-crystallin, indicating that both proteins\nassociated together in colcemid-induced collapse of the inter-\nmediate filament networks (Figure 9L).\nDISCUSSION\nA Direct Interaction between R120G \u0001B-Crystallin and\nDesmin Leads to Aggregate Formation\nHere, we have shown that the R120G mutation causes \u0001B-crys-\ntallin to increase its binding to desmin filaments in vitro as shown\nby both cosedimentation assay and electron microscopy. Analysis\nof the cosedimentation assay data allowed us to calculate an\napparent dissociation constant (Kd) for both the wild-type and\nR120G \u0001B-crystallin. The values are \u201capparent\u201d because both\nproteins are polymers, a problem previously recognized by others\n(Bennardini et al., 1992). At the very least, we have identified an\nimportant trend relevant to understanding the disease situation.\nThe R120G mutation in \u0001B-crystallin causes a significant decrease\nin the dissociation constant and also increases the level of binding\nto the desmin filaments. The transfection data we have presented\n(Table 1 and Figure 8) also show that desmin forms aggregates\nwith \u0001B-crystallin when cotransfected with R120G \u0001B-crystallin,\nwhereas the wild-type protein facilitates desmin network forma-\ntion. The recovery of cells from the drug-induced collapse of\nFigure 5. Visualization of wild-type and\nR120G \u0001B-crystallin binding to desmin fila-\nment in vitro by electron microscopy. Desmin\nwas assembled either alone (A) or in the pres-\nence of wild-type (B), or R120G \u0001B-crystallin\n(C) at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. After assembly, protein\nsamples were negatively stained with 1%\n(wt\/vol) uranyl acetate and examined by\nelectron microscopy. Under these assembly\nconditions, desmin formed typical 10-nm fil-\naments with several microns in length (A). In\nthe presence of wild-type \u0001B-crystallin,\ndesmin filaments had some \u0001B-crystallin par-\nticles attached (B, arrows). In contrast, the\nincreased binding of R120G \u0001B-crystallin re-\nsulted in a very extensive coating of desmin\nfilaments (C, arrows). All micrographs are at\nthe same magnification. Bar, 200 nm.\nDesmin Aggregates by R120G \u0001B-Crystallin\nVol. 15, May 2004 2341\nendogenous desmin filaments is also hindered by the presence of\nR120G \u0001B-crystallin (Figure 9). These data not only show that the\nmutation has caused a gain in function by now inducing desmin\nfilaments to aggregate and\/or bundle abnormally. On the basis of\nthese new data and the existing in vitro data (Bennardini et al.,\n1992), we conclude that the desmin filament aggregation in the\ndisease could involve direct binding of \u0001B-crystallin to desmin.\nAggregation of Desmin Depends upon Network Status\nDRMs caused by mutations in either the desmin or \u0001B-\ncrystallin gene are inherited neuromuscular disorders that\nare characterized by the accumulation of aggregates con-\ntaining desmin and \u0001B-crystallin (Vicart et al., 1998;\nGoebel and Warlo, 2001; Fischer et al., 2002; Goebel, 2003).\nDespite this direct physical association between desmin\nand \u0001B-crystallin in patients with myopathy, analysis of\nthe effects of R120G \u0001B-crystallin in a mouse model\n(Wang et al., 2001) and a tissue culture model (Chavez\nZobel et al., 2003) suggested that there was not a direct\ninteraction between desmin and \u0001B-crystallin. This arose\nbecause aggregates containing only R120G \u0001B-crystallin\nand no desmin were found, although these were associ-\nated with IFs (Wang et al., 2001; Chavez Zobel et al., 2003)\nas has been reported for proteins accumulated in aggre-\nsome-like structures (Johnston et al., 1998; Kopito, 2000).\nOur results with transfected BHK21 cells (Figure 1) mir-\nrored these events, but others presented here (Figures 8 and\n9 and Table 1) help explain why the transfection (Chavez\nZobel et al., 2003) and transgenic models (type 1 aggregates\nin Wang et al., 2001) led to R120G \u0001B-crystallin aggregates\nthat excluded endogenous IF proteins. Changes in second-\nary and tertiary structure do cause increased subunit asso-\nciation for R120G \u0001B-crystallin (Bova et al., 1999; Perng et al.,\n1999a,b), and overexpression in tissue culture cells and mus-\ncle leads to extensive self-aggregation (Wang et al., 2001;\nChavez Zobel et al., 2003). Our transfection data (Figures 8\nand 9 and Table 1) show that to see the most dramatic effects\nof R120G \u0001B-crystallin upon desmin in an overexpression\nsystem, then either new filament networks must be formed\nat the same time as \u0001B-crystallin is being expressed or there\nmust be a drastic and complete rearrangement of the IF\nnetwork as demonstrated in colcemid-treated BHK21 cells.\nThese are probable reasons why complete coaggregation of\ndesmin and \u0001B-crystallin was not observed by previous\ninvestigators and the phenotypes recorded did not precisely\nmimic typical pathology of the R120G \u0001B-crystallin myop-\nathy (Vicart et al., 1998; Fardeau et al., 2000).\nLate Onset Characteristic of the Disease Linked to\nSpecific Muscle Events\nBoth the human disease (Vicart et al., 1998; Fardeau et al.,\n2000) and the mouse model (Wang et al., 2001) have late\nonset phenotypes, but both \u0001B-crystallin (Arbustini et al.,\n1998; Xiao and Benjamin, 1999) and desmin (Lobrinus et al.,\nFigure 6. Increased binding of R120G \u0001B-crystallin to desmin fil-\naments leads to aggregate formation. Desmin was assembled in\nvitro (lanes 1 and 2) in the presence of either wild-type (lanes 3 and\n4) or R120G (lanes 5 and 6) \u0001B-crystallin in a molar ratio of 1:1 at\n37\u00b0C for 15 min. The assembly mixtures were subjected to low-\nspeed centrifugation at 2500 \u0001 g for 15 min. The resulting superna-\ntant (S) and pellet (P) fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and\nvisualized by Coomassie Blue staining. The position of desmin and\n\u0001B-crystallin are indicated. Under these assay conditions, 60% of\nassembled desmin filaments sedimented (lane 2), a situation that\nwas not altered by the presence of wild-type \u0001B-crystallin (lane 4).\nIn the presence of R120G \u0001B-crystallin, however, 96% of the assem-\nbled desmin filaments were pelleted (lane 6). Increased binding of\nR120G \u0001B-crystallin to desmin was also observed (cf. lanes 3 and 4\nwith lanes 5 and 6). These data suggest that desmin assembled in\nthe presence of R120G \u0001B-crystallin are more easily sedimented as\na result of increased filament\u2013filament interactions.\nFigure 7. Expression levels of endogenous vimentin and sHSPs in\ndifferent cell lines. Near confluent H36, SW13\/cl.2, and MCF7 cells\nwere extracted with detergent buffer containing 0.6 M KCl followed\nby centrifugation at 18,000 \u0001 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. Concentrated SDS\nsample buffer was then added to the cytosolic fractions and protein\ncontent ratios determined so that equivalent gel loadings from the\ndifferent cell lines could be made to facilitate direct comparison of\nthe samples. After immunoblotting, equivalent protein loadings\nwere compared by probing with antibodies against HSC70 (A),\nvimentin (B), HSP27 (C), and \u0001B-crystallin (D). Notice HSC70 levels\nare similar in each sample, demonstrating the equivalent protein\nloading and thus allowing direct comparison of the different cell\nextracts. H36 cells express both HSP27 and \u0001B-crystallin, but this\ncell line expresses the lowest relative level of HSP27 compared with\nthe other cell lines. Only H36 cells express vimentin, an intermediate\nfilament protein that coassembles with desmin. MCF7 cells express\nthe highest relative level of HSP27.\nM.D. Perng et al.\nMolecular Biology of the Cell2342\n1998) levels are increased during myoblast fusion. This sug-\ngests that there has to be other events occurring during\nmuscle development to prevent both desmin aggregate for-\nmation and loss of muscle function in the patients and the\ntransgenic mice expressing either R120G \u0001B-crystallin or\ndesmin mutants. Other studies have shown that chaperone\nproteins such as HSP27 (Ito et al., 2003) and HSP70 (Chavez\nZobel et al., 2003) could inhibit the aggregation of R120G\n\u0001B-crystallin. Our transfection studies show that the pres-\nence of other IF networks can reduce desmin aggregate\nformation in agreement with previous studies, e.g., Raats et\nal. (1990) and Schweitzer et al. (2001). Desmin is one of the\nearliest differentiated markers expressed in myoblasts (Furst\net al., 1989; Schaart et al., 1989), and these cells also express\nsynemin (Granger and Lazarides, 1980), nestin, and vimen-\ntin (Lendahl et al., 1990), giving an adequate network for\ndesmin network formation, via a coassembly mechanism\n(Bennett et al., 1979; Gard et al., 1979; Capetanaki et al., 1997)\nduring muscle development. This suggests that there are\ncircumstances specific to mature muscle that particularly\npredisposes it to the effects of the \u0001B-crystallin mutation,\nthus explaining the late onset characteristic of these diseases.\nWe have shown that any situation that induces the collapse\nof the endogenous desmin filament networks will make the\nendogenous desmin networks more prone to aggregation by\nR120G \u0001B-crystallin. Other studies have shown that cell\nstresses such as heat shock (Morley et al., 1995), osmotic shock\n(D\u2019Alessandro et al., 2002), or chemical stress (Ku et al., 1996; Ku\net al., 1998) can provide the trigger to induce IF collapse and\nreveal the effects of IF perturbations. Indeed, stress promotes\nthe increased association of \u0001B-crystallin with IFs (Djabali et al.,\n1997), and this is true, too, of muscle (Golenhofen et al., 1998)\nwhere levels of \u0001B-crystallin are increased as a result of stress\n(Inaguma et al., 1995; Neufer and Benjamin, 1996), and there is\nalso a stress-induced translocation of \u0001B-crystallin to the myo-\nfibril cytoskeleton (Golenhofen et al., 1998). These data suggest\nthat any muscle stress could initiate and\/or propagate the\ndevelopment of DRM caused by the R120G mutation in \u0001B-\ncrystallin.\nCardiac muscle usually responds to stress by hypertrophy\n(Tarone and Lembo, 2003). In the mouse model, overexpres-\nsion of R120G \u0001B-crystallin, but not wild-type \u0001B-crystallin,\nalso induced hypertrophy (Wang et al., 2001). The hypertro-\nphy resulted in progressive muscle failure (Wang et al., 2001)\ntypified by desmin aggregate formation and this is an ex-\nample of how hypertrophy as a stress response could indeed\nbe a potential trigger for desmin filament aggregate forma-\ntion in cardiac muscle. In skeletal muscle, eccentric exercise\n(Yu et al., 2003) induces new sarcomere formation with\nsignificant changes in desmin expression and distribution.\nThis is another example where a physiological response later\nin life could initiate a sequence of events to allow pathology\nto develop as a result of desmin or \u0001B-crystallin mutations.\nThe loss of desmin filament function in cardiac and skeletal\nmuscle myocytes is expected to affect not only mitochondrial\nfunction (reviewed in Capetanaki, 2002) but also active force\ngeneration (Balogh et al., 2002) in the cardiomyocytes. Such\ndamaging consequences make it easy to appreciate how the\nexpression of R120G \u0001B-crystallin could cause the develop-\ning myopathy by affecting desmin filament function.\nIn the transgenic mouse model of the R120G \u0001B-crystallin-\ninduced myopathy, it was observed that the levels of R120G\n\u0001B-crystallin in cardiomyocytes increased with age (Wang et\nal., 2001). This was not the case for wild-type protein, and it\nwas proposed that protein degradation could be affected by the\nmutant \u0001B-crystallin. Two other missense mutations in \u0001B-\ncrystallin that cause muscle myopathy reported increased lev-\nels of total \u0001B-crystallin and also desmin in the affected skeletal\nmuscles (Selcen and Engel, 2003), despite the fact that the\nmutant \u0001B-crystallins were expressed at lower levels than the\nFigure 8. Effect of wild-type and R120G\u0001B-crys-\ntallin upon desmin filament formation in vivo.\nH36 (A, D, and G), SW13\/cl.2 (B, E, and H) and\nMCF7 cells (C, F, and I) were transiently trans-\nfected with desmin alone (A\u2013C) or cotransfected\nwith either wild-type (D\u2013F) or R120G \u0001B-crystal-\nlin (G\u2013I). At 48 h posttransfection, desmin fila-\nment organizations were examined by immuno-\nstaining by using monoclonal anti-desmin\nantibody. In H36 cells, transfected desmin forms\naggregates (A, arrow) as well as filaments (A,\narrowhead). In the presence of cotransfected wild-\ntype \u0001B-crystallin, transfected desmin tends to\nform filament networks that are extended\nthroughout the cytoplasm (D). SW13\/cl.2 cells\ntransfected with desmin form spot-like desmin\naggregates (B, arrow) with some filamentous\nstructures (B, arrowhead), but cotransfection with\nwild-type \u0001B-crystallin resulted in the formation\nof many more extended desmin filaments in\ntransfected cells (E). In contrast, cotransfection\nwith R120G \u0001B-crystallin induced large cytoplas-\nmic desmin aggregates without any detectable\nfilaments in both the H36 (G) and SW13\/cl.2 (H)\ncells. In MCF7 cells, desmin formed extended fil-\naments with some peripheral accumulations (C,\narrow). Whereas cotransfection with wild-type\n\u0001B-crystallin had no obvious effect on desmin fil-\nament networks (F), transfection of desmin with\nR120G mutant induced the formation of ring-like\nperinuclear desmin aggregates (I). Bars, 20 \u0003m.\nQuantification of desmin network organizations\nin transfected cells is shown in Table 1.\nDesmin Aggregates by R120G \u0001B-Crystallin\nVol. 15, May 2004 2343\nwild-type \u0001B-crystallin (Selcen and Engel, 2003), again sugges-\ntive of a compromised protein degradation system. Indeed, the\nprotein aggregates containing the desmin and \u0001B-crystallin\nwere not ubiquitin labeled (Selcen and Engel, 2003), which is\nunusual compared with other myopathies (Goebel and Warlo,\n2000; Goebel, 2003). Satellite cells isolated from patients with\nthe R120G \u0001B-crystallin mutation were also more susceptible\nto oxidative stress (Nedellec et al., 2002) symptomatic of a\ncompromised stress response. The demonstration that \u0001B-crys-\ntallin interacts with a ubiquitin ligase component and stimu-\nlates protein ubiquitination (den Engelsman et al., 2003) is very\nsuggestive of a direct role for \u0001B-crystallin in the ubiquitin\u2013\nproteosome pathway and a link between compromised protein\ndegradation and the developing myopathy (Hoffman, 2003).\nProtein aggregate formation impairs the function of the\nubiquitin\u2013proteosome system (Bence et al., 2001; Cowan et\nal., 2003) and results in the accumulation of \u0001B-crystallin in\naggresomes (Ito et al., 2002) along with IFs (Johnston et al.,\n1998). Aggregates of desmin and \u0001B-crystallin typify the\nhistopathological feature of the DRMs (Goebel and Warlo,\n2000; Fischer et al., 2002; Goebel, 2003), and these would\naccompany and exacerbate compromised protein degrada-\ntion in muscle cells. The compromised turnover of mis-\nfolded and\/or damaged proteins would be an additional\nstress induced by the \u0001B-crystallin mutations, which could\neither trigger or propagate the developing myopathy. Such\nhypotheses concerning the initiation and downstream con-\nsequences for the R120G mutation in \u0001B-crystallin merit\nfurther investigation.\nFormation of IF Networks Is Assisted by \u0001B-Crystallin\nThe results from the transient transfection of desmin into\nthree different cell lines demonstrate the ability of \u0001B-crys-\ntallin to assist the formation of IF networks in living cells.\nWe had previously proposed one of the functions of sHSPs\nis to help manage IF networks by controlling filament\u2013\nfilament interactions (Perng et al., 1999a), and the data pre-\nsented here support this proposed function for \u0001B-crystallin,\nalthough with some qualifications. Cell background influ-\nences the ability of desmin to form networks (Table 1) and\nalthough this will be partly due to the IF expression profile\nof the cells (Schweitzer et al., 2001), \u0001B-crystallin is clearly\nFigure 9.
