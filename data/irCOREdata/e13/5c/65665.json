It is claimed that the ventral stream serves object \nrecognition (i.e. vision for perception), and the dorsal streams provides visual \ninformation for the guidance of action (i.e. vision for action). This model is supported \nby evidence from the domain of spatial vision, but it remains unclear how motion \nvision fits into that model. More specifically, it is unclear how the motion complex \nV5\/MT contributes to vision for perception and vision for action. We addressed this \nquestion in an earlier study with the V5-lesioned patient LM (Schenk, Mai, Ditterich & \nZihl, 2000). We found that she is not only impaired in perceptual tasks but also in \ncatching, suggesting a role for V5\/MT+ in vision for both perception and action. \nHowever, LM\u2019s lesion goes beyond V5\/MT+ into more dorsal regions. It is thus \npossible, that the catching deficit was not produced by damage to V5\/MT+ itself. In \nthis case, one would expect that selective interference with V5\/MT+ would have no \neffect on catching. In the present study we tested this prediction by applying rTMS \nover V5\/MT+ of the left hemisphere while healthy subjects were either performing a \ncatching or a reaching task. We found that V5-TMS reduced the speed of the \ncatching but not the reaching response. These results confirm that V5\/MT+ is not \nonly involved in perceptual but also in visuomotor tasks.  \n \n \nKeywords: visual motion, interception, dorsal\/ventral streams, akinetopsia, reach-to-\ngrasp, prehension \n \n \n \n - 3 - \nIntroduction  \nUngerleider and co-workers (Ungerleider & Haxby, 1994; Ungerleider & Mishkin, \n1982) suggested that the various areas of the visual brain could be separated into \ntwo visual streams, which are anatomically and functionally distinct. Both of these \nstreams originate in the primary visual cortex, but then part company and go either \ntowards the temporal cortex in the case of the ventral stream, or towards the parietal \ncortex, in the case of the dorsal stream. Ungerleider and Mishkin (1982) assumed \nthat the ventral stream is primarily concerned with visual attributes that allow the \nidentification of objects (e.g. colour and form), whereas the dorsal stream is \nconcerned with visuo-spatial aspects (e.g. position and motion), and allows the \nlocalization of visual objects. More recently, Milner and Goodale (Goodale & Milner, \n1992; Milner & Goodale, 1993) suggested a functional re-interpretation of the original \ntwo-stream hypothesis. They argue that the functional distinction between the two \nstreams is not primarily based on the type of visual attributes, which are processed in \nthese two streams (i.e. colour\/form in ventral stream versus position and motion in \nthe dorsal stream), but on the behavioural or cognitive function for which the visual \ninformation is used. More particularly they suggest that visual information which is \nused for object identification and scene identification, i.e. vision for perception, is \nprocessed in the ventral stream, whereas visual information used for the control of \nmotor behaviour, i.e. vision for action, is processed in the dorsal stream. This model \nby Milner and Goodale received much support from neuropsychological and \nexperimental studies (see Milner & Goodale, 1995). However, most of its evidence \ncomes from experiments on intrinsic physical attributes such as form, size, and \norientation perception (Norman, 2002). Other visual attributes (e.g. motion and depth \n - 4 - \nperception) have been examined much less in this context, and it therefore remains \nunclear how these aspects of processing fit into the model (Goodale, 1993). \n \nIn the case of motion vision it is certainly conceivable that the distinction between \nvision for perception and action also applies, since it is obvious that motion vision is \nrelevant for both object recognition and visuomotor control. For example, object \nrecognition requires figure-ground segregation, for which motion is an important cue \n(Anstis, 1978; Sekuler et al., 1990). Similarly, visuomotor control tasks also include \ncatching behaviour, and we would expect that successful catching behaviour is not \npossible without motion vision. Even manual movements towards stationary targets \nmight involve motion vision, namely for the visual monitoring of the moving hand \n(Paillard, 1996). The question thus arises whether there are distinct brain areas \nprocessing visual motion information either for perceptual or visuomotor tasks. \nFunctional imaging studies have shown that there is a whole set of motion-related \nareas in the human brain (Culham, He, Dukelow & Verstraten, 2001). For most of \nthose areas very little is known about their functional contribution, and therefore it is \ntoo early to decide whether this set of motion-related areas can be subdivided into a \nperceptual and a visuomotor stream.  \n \nHowever, one of those brain areas, namely the motion complex V5\/MT+, has been \nexamined much more extensively, and it is clear that this area makes an important \ncontribution to a number of aspects of motion perception. For example it has been \nfound that the preferred speed range of cells in V5\/MT+ (Lagae, Raiguel & Orban, \n1993; Maunsell & Van Essen, 1983; Mikami, Newsome & Wurtz, 1986; Rodman & \nAlbright, 1987) correlates closely with psychophysical performance in speed-\ndiscrimination tasks (McKee, 1981; Orban, de Wolf & Maes, 1984; Orban, Van \n - 5 - \nCalenbergh, De Bruyn & Maes, 1985), suggesting that V5\/MT+ is the essential \nmechanism underlying this performance. This conclusion is confirmed by studies that \nshow a degradation of speed discrimination after damage to V5 (Hess, Baker CL & \nZihl, 1989; Orban, Saunders & Vandenbussche, 1995; Plant & Nakayama, 1993; \nZihl, von Cramon & Mai, 1983; Zihl, von Cramon, Mai & Schmid, 1991). Similarly, for \nthe perception of direction in global motion stimuli it has been found that activity in \nV5\/MT+ is closely related to performance. In fact, it could be demonstrated that a \nbias in perceived direction can be induced by stimulating direction-specific cells in \nV5\/MT+ (Salzman & Britten, 1990). Furthermore it was found that damage to V5\/MT+ \nleads to a performance drop in tasks involving the identification of direction in global \nmotion stimuli (Baker, Hess & Zihl, 1991; Newsome & Par\u00e9, 1988; Plant, Laxer, \nBarbaro, Schiffman & Nakayama, 1993; Plant & Nakayama, 1993; Schenk & Zihl, \n1997; Vaina, Cowey, Eskew, LeMay & Kemper, 2001). It is thus well established that \nV5\/MT+ plays an essential role in a variety of perceptual tasks.  \n \nHowever, V5\/MT+\u2019s role in visuomotor tasks is still unclear. We addressed this \nquestion in a recent study with the motion-blind patient LM (Schenk, Mai et al., 2000). \nLM\u2019s brain damage includes V5\/MT+ in both hemispheres, and consequently her \nability to perceive visual motion is severely impaired (Zihl et al., 1983; Zihl et al., \n1991). In our study, we found that she is also impaired in a catching task (Schenk, \nMai et al., 2000). This seems to suggest that V5\/MT+ contributes both to perceptual \nand visuomotor tasks. There is, however, a problem with this conclusion in that LM\u2019s \nlesions go beyond V5\/MT+ and extend into surrounding areas (Shipp, de Jong, Zihl, \nFrackowiak & Zeki, 1994). The lesions extend dorsally to the intraparietal sulcus, \ninfringing on area 39 at least in her right hemisphere. Her lesions might therefore \nalso include the superior temporal sulcus and the motion-responsive areas in the \n - 6 - \nintraparietal sulcus. These regions have been found in functional imaging studies to \nrespond selectively to visual motion stimuli (Culham et al., 2001).  \n \nGiven the extent of LM\u2019s lesion, it is therefore quite possible that areas other than \nV5\/MT+ are responsible for her deficits. With respect to the perceptual deficits, LM\u2019s \nresults have been confirmed by various studies that used transcranial magnetic \nstimulation (TMS) to induce transient disruptions in V5\/MT+. These TMS studies \nshowed that a selective disruption of V5\/MT+ produces deficits in the perception of \nvisual motion that are similar to LM\u2019s deficits (Beckers & H\u00f6mberg, 1992; Beckers & \nZeki, 1995; Walsh, Ellison, Battelli & Cowey, 1998). However, similar TMS studies \nusing visuomotor tasks have not yet been conducted, and it is, therefore, unknown \nwhether a selective disruption of V5\/MT+ would also suffice to produce a visuomotor \ndeficit.  \n \nIt was the aim of the present study to examine this question. We compared the \neffects of repetitive TMS (rTMS) over V5\/MT+ with the effects obtained after \nstimulation over a control site (vertex) or a site that is approximately 2 cm dorsal to \nV5\/MT+. Two visuomotor tasks were used: a catching task using a moving target \nobject, and a standard reach-to-grasp task with a stationary target object. We \nexpected that if V5 is involved in visuomotor processing, TMS over V5 should \ninterfere with the subjects\u2019 ability to predict the course of the target\u2019s movement, and \nthereby impair their catching performance.  \n \n - 7 - \nMethods: \n1. TMS stimulation \nWe used a MagStim 200 Super Rapid Stimulator with a figure of eight coil (diameter \n90 mm; Magstim, Whitland, Dyffed, Wales, UK), which was placed tangential to the \nsurface of the skull with the coil handle pointing backwards at approximately 45\u00b0to \nthe spinal cord. The coil was held to the skull by the experimenter using the right \nhand to hold the coil, and the left hand to stabilize the head against the coil. A head-\nand chin rest was used to minimize head movements during the experiment. After \neach trial the position of the coil was checked. In three subjects head-movements \nduring the experiments were measured and found to be negligible. For these head-\nmovement measurements, we used a 3D movement registration system which uses \nultrasonic markers. This system is described in more detail below. One marker (coil-\nmarker) was placed at the centre of the coil, the other marker (reference marker) was \nplaced at the centre of the dorsal surface of the skull (i.e. vertex). We recorded head \nmovements for both the catching and the reach-to-grasp task. Three subjects and 10 \nTrials per subject and task were recorded. To assess the extent of coil-displacement \nduring the period of TMS stimulation, we determined the maximum value of change \nin the distance between the coil- and the reference marker during the 500 ms \nStimulation period. The average value of maximal displacement was less than 0.7 \nmm (sd: 0.16) during the catching task, and less than 0.8 mm (sd: 0.29) during the \nreach-to-grasp task.  \nRepetitive pulse TMS (rTMS) was delivered at 10 Hz for 500 ms at 65% of stimulator \noutput (corresponding to 1.3 T or 110% of the average TMS motor thresholds of our \nsubjects), beginning at the onset of the trial, which was indicated by the opening of \nthe LC shutterglasses (see below).  \n - 8 - \n \nWe stimulated at three different sites: V5, vertex, and a site which was approximately \n2 cm dorsal to V5 (dorsal site, DS). To stimulate V5 the centre of the coil is typically \npositioned 3 cm above the mastoid-inion line and 5 cm lateral to the midline in the \nsagittal plane (Walsh et al., 1998). However, since it is known that the locus of V5 \nvaries between individuals (Watson et al., 1993), we used the perception of TMS-\ninduced moving phosphenes to confirm the correct position for stimulation in each \nindividual (Stewart, Battelli, Walsh & Cowey, 1999). The chosen position was \ntypically near the conventional coordinates V5 stimulation (see above). However, \ndeviations of up to 1.5 cm in either direction were found. In 5 out of 6 subjects the \nposition of V5 could also be checked anatomically. For those subjects structural MRI \nscans were available, and it was confirmed with a frameless stereotaxic system \n(BrainsightTM, Rogue Research, Montreal, Canada) that the chosen stimulation site \nwas near the anatomical landmark for V5 (Dumoulin et al., 2000), namely the \nintersection of the ascending limb and the posterior continuation of the inferior \ntemporal sulcus. V5 was stimulated unilaterally on the left hemisphere, because \nprevious TMS studies found effects across both hemifields when stimulating over the \nleft hemisphere (Stewart, Ellison, Walsh & Cowey, 2001). Left-hemisphere \nstimulation, thereby, produces perceptual deficits that are similar to the deficits \nobserved in patient LM (Walsh et al., 1998).  \n \nOur second stimulation site was at the vertex. Location of the vertex was determined \nby finding the intersection of the mid sagittal plane (defined by the nasion to inion \nline) and the mid coronal plane (defined by the line between the intertrachial notches \nof the ears). This location corresponds to the position Cz of the 10-20 International \nEEG system. Stimulation over the vertex provides a good control condition since it \n - 9 - \nevokes all of the unspecific TMS effects (e.g. noise and tickling sensation), without \ninducing currents in specific brain areas. In addition we introduced a second control \ncondition to determine the spatial specificity of any effects, which might be found \nafter V5 stimulation. For this purpose we chose a control site that was near to V5, but \nclearly outside of its borders. To determine the position for this control site, we first \nlocalized the V5 site, and then moved the coil dorsally along the surface of the skull \nuntil moving phosphenes could no longer be induced. The position of this site (dorsal \nsite, DS) was on average 1.8 cm dorsal (sd: 0.4) to the position of V5.  \n \n - 10 - \n2. Subjects \nSix subjects (aged 21-38, 3 female, 3 male) participated in this study. All subjects \nwere right-handed, had normal vision, and reported an absence of epilepsy in their \nfamily medical history. They consented to take part in the study after they had \nreceived information about safety issues relating to TMS and rTMS. Local ethical \ncommittee approval was granted for all procedures.  \n \n3. Tasks and procedures \nTwo visuomotor tasks were used. The first task was a catching task using a target \nobject that moved away from the subject either to the right or to the left (see Fig. 1A). \nTwo different speed conditions were used (object speed=0.25 m\/s or 0.50 m\/s). The \nparameters of the catching task were the same as those used in the experiment with \nLM (Schenk, Mai et al., 2000). The second task was a reach-to-grasp task, in which \nthe target object was stationary (see Fig. 1B). The spatial measurements for the \ntrajectories in the catching task, and the positions of the object in the reach-to-grasp \ntask are presented in Figure 1. The two tasks were similar with respect to the \ndemands on the motor system, but quite different with respect to their demands on \nthe visual system. In both tasks, subjects had to produce rapid grasping movements. \nHowever, only in the catching task, the subject had to take visual information about \nthe target\u2019s movement into account. Since V5 is primarily involved in the coding of \nvisual motion, it was expected that V5-specific effects should be found primarily in \nthe catching task.  \n \nFigure 1 here  \n - 11 - \n \nIn both tasks, subjects were instructed to use their right hand. To ensure that the \ntemporal parameters of the subjects\u2019 responses were comparable in the two tasks, \nsubjects were asked in both tasks to move as fast as possible. To prevent head \nmovements the subject\u2019s head was constrained by a head and chin rest. Ear plugs \nsuppressed the noise coming from the TMS coil and the moving object. At the start of \neach trial, the subject\u2019s right hand rested on a plate (start switch) in front of the body. \nSubjects wore LC shutter glasses (Plato System, Translucent Technologies, Toronto, \nCanada), which opened at the beginning of the trial. At the same time the rTMS-\nsequence was triggered, and in the case of the catching task the object started to \nmove. The LC shutter glasses stayed either open for 100 ms (observation time \nOT=100 ms) or for 800 ms (OT=800 ms). With an OT of 100 ms, subjects saw the \nstart of the trial, but not the movement of their hand. With an OT of 800 ms, subjects \nsaw the object for the entire duration of the trial, and could also observe the \nmovement of their hand. In the case of LM, we had found that the duration of the OT \nhad a significant effect on her performance. LM caught significantly more objects if \nshe could observe the object for a longer period, and if she could see her hand \n(Schenk, Mai et al., 2000). \n \nIn each condition 40 trials were presented. The three different TMS conditions (V5, \nvertex, DS) and the two different visual conditions (100 ms vs. 800 ms) were \npresented in separate blocks. Each block was presented twice; blocks for the \ndifferent conditions were presented in an interleaved order. The order of the blocks \nand thus the order of the TMS and visual conditions was counterbalanced across the \nsubjects. Within each block, different types of trials were randomly mixed. In the case \nof the catching task the trials differed with respect to the direction and speed of the \n - 12 - \ntarget. In the case of the reach-to-grasp task the trials differed with respect to the \nposition of the object. The two tasks were presented in two separate sessions. At the \nstart of each experimental session, the skull positions for the TMS were determined, \nand the task was practised for 15 min (40 trials). Each session lasted for \napproximately 90 minutes. A short break of approximately 10 minutes was provided \nafter the first half of the session. \n \n4. Apparatus \nIn this section, we provide a description of the machine that was used to generate the \nobject motion, and the devices used to record the temporal and spatial aspects of the \nmanual response.  \n \nSystem to generate 2D motion of real objects (Servo-object-controller, SOC): \nThis system uses two motor-driven linear axes to move a target object within a \nhorizontal area that covers an area of 1m\u00b2. The linear axes are covered by a metal \nplate. Magnets transfer the movement of the linear axes to an object carrier that sits \non the surface of the metal plate. The target object itself (small cylinder: weight 15 g, \nheight 6 cm, diameter 4 cm) also contains a weak magnet and sits on the object \ncarrier. This system is controlled by a PC, which also triggers all other events (e.g. \nopening and closing of LC shutter glasses, start of rTMS-sequence). A detailed \ndescription of that system has been provided elsewhere (Schenk, Philipp et al., \n2000).  \n \nMeasuring the manual response: At the start of each trial subjects rested their \nhand on a start button which was on the table in front of the centre of their body (see \nFig. 1 A,B). This start button contained an electronic switch which signalled the \n - 13 - \nbeginning of the manual response. The end of the manual response was indicated by \nanother switch that was contained within the target object. As soon as the subject \ngrasped the object the switch within the object was released, and a signal was \ntransmitted to the PC.  \nIn addition a 3D movement registration device was used to record the trajectory of \nthe arm and fingers during the subject\u2019s manual response. This registration device \nemploys ultrasonic loudspeakers as markers and a panel with embedded \nmicrophones as receivers for the ultrasonic signals. This system (CMS 70, Fa. \nZebris, Germany) has a spatial resolution of 0.1 mm and achieves a sampling \nfrequency of 50 Hz when three markers are used. We used three markers to \nmeasure both the hand\u2019s transport to the target (marker on the wrist, above the \nstyloid process of the ulna) and the opening and closing of the fingers during the \ngrasp (markers on the nails of the index finger and the thumb). \n \n5. Data analysis and statistics \nOur choice of performance measures was partly based on the results from our study \nwith LM, and partly on the results from other TMS studies, and included measures of \naccuracy and movement timing. Accuracy was measured by computing the \npercentage of trials (%error) in which the subject could catch or grasp the target \nobject. A grasp was only considered to be successful, if the subject could lift the \nobject from the object carrier without dropping it. In our study with LM, we found that \nher success rate in the catching task was significantly lower than that of healthy \nsubjects. But even in those trials in which LM was able to catch the target object, her \nperformance was not normal. In particular, we found that her reaching speed was \nlower and more variable than that of healthy subjects (Schenk, Mai et al., 2000). We \ntherefore decided to compute average reaching speed (RS) and peak reaching \n - 14 - \nspeed (Vmax) as a further performance measure in the present study. We also \nmeasured the relative time when the peak velocity occurred (%Tvmax; this variable is \ncomputed in the following way: [time of peak velocity\/time of reaching \nmovement]*100). This variable is often used to assess the relative duration of the \nacceleration and deceleration phase of the reaching movements. It has been found \nthat the deceleration phase is selectively prolonged in the absence of visual feedback \nfrom the moving hand (for a review, see Churchill, Hopkins, Roenqvist, & Vogt, \n2000). This suggests that the relative duration of the deceleration phase, and \naccordingly %Tvmax could be used to check for TMS-induced changes in the use of \nvisual feedback from the moving hand. Our last performance measure was reaction \ntime. Reaction time (RT) is a measure that is frequently used in TMS studies, \nbecause it provides a sensitive indication of TMS-induced processing delays.  \n \nA further index, that expressed the amplitude of the TMS effect, was computed for \nvariables that proved to be significantly affected by TMS in one or more conditions. \nTo calculate this index, called %TMS-effect, the following formula was used: %TMS-\neffectPM(i) = (PMv-PMi)*100\/mean(PMv,PMi). In this formula PM stands for a \nperformance measure (i.e. %error, RS or RT), i indicates the TMS site for which \n%TMS-effect was computed (i.e. either V5 or DS), and subscript v indicates that \nvertex was used as the reference condition. This index expresses the TMS-effect \nrelative to the performance in the control condition (i.e. vertex) as a normalized \npercentage-difference.  \n \nFor the computation of %errors all trials were used. For the computation of the \nkinematic measures (i.e. RS, Vmax, %Tvmax, and RT) some trials had to be \ndiscarded, namely those trials in which the subject did not grasp or catch the object, \n - 15 - \nor which contained recording artefacts. However, 94% of the trials could be used. \nBefore reaching speed could be computed, the recording traces had to be filtered \nusing a non-parametric regression method (Marquardt & Mai, 1994). The results from \nthe catching and reach-to-grasp tasks were analysed separately. For the catching \ntask, an ANOVA with the three within-subject factors TMS (V5, vertex, DS), \nobservation time (100 ms, 800 ms), and motion direction (leftward, rightward) was \nconducted. A similar ANOVA was used for the results from the reach-to-grasp task. \nInstead of the factor motion direction, the factor object position (left, right) was \nemployed. Bonferroni-corrections were used for post-hoc comparisons. A \nsignificance-threshold of 5% was adopted.  \n \nResults \nTask 1: Catching task \nThe factor TMS-site had a significant effect on average reaching speed (RS, \nF(2\/10)=9.98, p < 0.004), and peak reaching speed (Vmax, F(2\/10)=14.91; p<0.001). \nPost-hoc comparisons confirmed that V5-stimulation produced a reduction in RS and \nVmax when compared to stimulation at either of the two control sites (see also Table \n1). It should be noted that the factor TMS-site had no effect on %error or on RT.  \n \nThe factor observation time had a significant effect on %error (F(1\/10)=7.98, p \n<0.37), and RT (F(1\/10)=18.18, p <0.008), but not on RS, vmax, or %tvmax. Shorter \nobservation times led to higher error rates (at 100 ms (mean, sd): 6.17%, 2.76; at \n800 ms: 1.73%, 1.92), and shorter reaction times (at 100 ms (mean, sd): 182.89 ms, \n53.29; at 800 ms: 188.94 ms, 49.36). These effects of observation time are probably \nbest explained if one assumes that subjects produce their best performance when \n - 16 - \nthey are able to view the target for more than 100 ms. If subjects are deprived of this \noption, the accuracy of their movements will suffer (i.e. higher error rates), but at the \nsame time they will be able to initiate their response earlier (i.e. reduced RTs). An \nalternative explanation could be that subjects launched their reaching movements \nfaster when they anticipated an early closure of the glasses (i.e. OT=100 ms). In this \ncase, we could also expect that accuracy would drop as a consequence of the well-\nknown speed-accuracy trade-off. Therefore, this explanation would also be \nconsistent with the observed effect of observation time on RTs and error rates. The \nfactor observation time did not modulate the effect of TMS (i.e. no interaction \nbetween the factors TMS-site and OT for any of the dependent measures). This \nresult contrasts with the significant effect of OT on LM\u2019s catching performance. On \nthe basis of LM\u2019s results it might have been expected that TMS stimulation of V5 \nwould lead to more pronounced deficits when the observation time was restricted to \n100 ms. The fact that we did not find this effect in this study suggests interesting \ndifferences in the behavioural consequences of TMS and lesions. We will explore the \nreasons for these differences in the Discussion.  \n \nThe factor motion direction did not produce any significant effects, nor were there any \nsignificant interaction effects involving the factor motion direction. In particular the \nlack of an interaction between the factors TMS-site and motion direction might be \nunexpected given the fact that we stimulated unilaterally over the left-hemisphere. \nOne might therefore have expected to see more pronounced V5-TMS effects with \nobjects moving to the contralateral hemispace, i.e. the right hemispace. We will \nreturn to this issue in the Discussion. The results are summarized in Table 1.  \nTable 1 here  \n - 17 - \n \nTo see whether the effect of the factor TMS-site on average and peak reaching \nspeed was specific to stimulation of V5, we conducted a further analysis in which we \nused %TMSRS and %TMSVmax (see Methods, for a definition of %TMS-effect) as the \ndependent variables for a repeated measures ANOVA with the factors TMS-site (V5 \nvs DS) and observation time (100 vs 800 ms). A significant effect of factor TMS-site \nwas obtained for both %TMSRS (F(1\/5)=10.46;p<0.023) and %TMSVmax \n(F1\/5)=28.94;p<0.003). This confirms that the reduction in reaching speed was \nsignificantly more pronounced after V5-stimulation than after DS-stimulation. \nMoreover, one-sample t-tests showed that the %TMS-effect differed significantly from \nzero only in the case of V5 [for H0 (%TMSRS(V5) =0), p < 0.03; for H0 (%TMSVmax \n(V5)= 0, p <0.025], but not in the case of DS-stimulation. The %TMS effects for the \ntwo sites and the two observation times are presented in Fig. 2A. No significant effect \nof factor observation time, and no interaction effect (TMS-site X observation time) \nwas found.  \nFigure 2 here  \n - 18 - \nTask 2: Reaching for a stationary object \nThe factor TMS-site had no significant effect (see Table 2, Fig. 2B). Observation time \nhad a significant effect on %Tvmax (F(1\/5)=21.609; p <0.006), reflecting the fact that \npeak reaching speed occurred in an earlier portion of the movement, when \nobservation was shorter [%Tvmax (means, sd) OT=100: 30.48%, 4.08; OT=800: \n33.51, 4.02]. This means that the deceleration phase was comparatively prolonged in \nthe short-observation-time condition. Since the short-observation-time condition \ncorresponds to an open-loop condition (i.e. condition where subjects were unable to \nsee their reaching movements), this finding is consistent with that of earlier studies \nwhere it was shown that the withdrawal of visual feedback leads to a prolonged \nduration of the deceleration phase (Churchill et al., 2000). Otherwise no significant \neffects of observation time were obtained.  \nThe factor object position had a significant effect on RT (F(1\/5)=10.16, p < 0.024), \nand RS (F(1\/5)=44.19, p < 0.001). Subjects responded earlier and faster to objects \non their right than to objects on their left side [RT (mean, sd) right pos.: 180.77 ms, \n40.73; left pos.: 198.33 ms, 42.68; RS (mean, sd) right pos.: 1.26 m\/s, 0.30; left pos.: \n0.99 m\/s, 0.22, see also Table 3]. We assume that this effect of object position \nreflects the fact that the head rest slightly hampered movements of the (right) hand \ntowards positions in the left hemispace. \nFurthermore, a significant interaction between the factors object position and \nobservation time was found for RT (F(1\/5)=7.97, p < 0.037). This interaction reflects \nthe fact that RTs for movements towards the leftward position are even more \nprolonged when the observation time is reduced to 100 ms (see Table 3). We can \nonly speculate why this is the case. We assume that most subjects are even more \nhesitant to start their movement in the short observation-time condition, because in \n - 19 - \nthis condition, they cannot see their response, and therefore subjects might feel that \nthe risk of colliding with the head-rest is further increased.  \nTable 2 here  \nTable 3 here \n \n \nDiscussion \nThe results from this TMS study suggest that it is indeed the disruption of processing \nin V5\/MT+ and not the disruption of more dorsal areas that was responsible for LM\u2019s \ncatching deficits. By using rTMS we could show that selective interference with \nV5\/MT+ is sufficient to cause a reduction in catching speed. Moreover, we found that \nstimulation in nearby dorsal regions does not affect catching performance. These \nfindings broadly confirm the findings obtained in our earlier study with the motion-\nblind patient LM (Schenk, Mai et al., 2000), and suggest that V5\/MT+ is not only \ninvolved in purely perceptual but also in visuomotor tasks. One might therefore \nconclude that V5\/MT+ provides visual motion input to both the ventral and the dorsal \nvisual stream.  \n \nHowever, there were also some differences in the findings obtained in the patient and \nwith TMS. The most obvious difference relates to the effect of observation time. LM\u2019s \nperformance but not the performance of the healthy subjects was significantly \naffected by the duration of the observation interval. Her catching performance \ndropped to subnormal levels if the duration of the observation interval was less than \n400 ms (Schenk, Mai et al., 2000). Accordingly, one might have expected that the \n - 20 - \neffect of V5-TMS would be more pronounced for shorter observation times. However, \nsuch an interaction between TMS and observation time was not found. At this stage \nwe can only speculate why this difference occurs. We think the most likely \nexplanation is that LM\u2019s dependence on long observation times reflects a \ncompensatory strategy, which she has acquired to use her intact spatial vision in \norder to compensate for her loss of motion vision. Long observation times allow her \nto use the length of the path travelled by the moving object during the observation \nperiod to estimate the velocity of that object. It is likely that such a compensatory \nstrategy only evolves over time and only in response to the experience of behavioural \nproblems. In the TMS study, subjects had neither the time nor the need to develop a \ncompensatory strategy, since the effect of TMS was only transient and did not \nproduce a dramatic drop in performance.  \n \nThis leads on to the second difference between the findings in LM and in our TMS \nstudy. Whereas LM\u2019s deficits were reflected in a decrease in catching speed and in \nan increase in catching errors, the TMS deficits were only reflected in a decrease in \ncatching speed. This seems to suggest that a catching deficit induced by V5-TMS is \nmuch more subtle than a deficit that is caused by a lesion to this area. This is \nprobably not surprising if one considers the fact that rTMS only induces a transient \nincrease of noise in the affected area (Walsh & Rushworth, 1999), and therefore \ndoes not faithfully mimic the total disruption of information flow that results from \nstructural brain damage.  \n \nAnother reason why LM\u2019s deficit is more pronounced than the deficit found after V5-\nTMS might be that the spatial extent of LM\u2019s lesion certainly exceeded the extent of \nthe area which was affected in our rTMS study. Moreover, LM\u2019s lesion was bilateral, \n - 21 - \nwhereas the stimulation in the present study was only unilaterally. Any of these \nfactors could explain why LM\u2019s deficit was more pronounced than the deficit which \nwe observed after V5-TMS.  \n \nIt is in fact rather surprising that the TMS-induced deficits were found equally for \nobjects travelling to both the right and the left hemispace despite the TMS stimulation \nbeing restricted to the left hemisphere. This is surprising since we know from \nelectrophysiological (Maunsell & Van Essen, 1987; Van Essen, 1985; Zeki, 1974, \n1980) and lesion studies (Newsome & Par\u00e9, 1988; Plant et al., 1993; Plant & \nNakayama, 1993; Schenk & Zihl, 1997; Vaina et al., 2001) that V5 on each \nhemisphere contains only a representation of the contralateral visual field. \nAccordingly one would expect that unilateral TMS of V5 should lead to strictly \ncontralateral deficits. Although some studies confirmed this expectation (Beckers & \nH\u00f6mberg, 1992; Beckers & Zeki, 1995; Stewart et al., 1999), others found whole-field \ndeficits after unilateral TMS (Hotson, Braun, Herzberg & Boman, 1994; Walsh et al., \n1998). One way of explaining such whole-field deficits after unilateral stimulation is \nby assuming that unilateral TMS disrupts not only the processing in the underlying \ncortical area but also affects the activity in connected brain areas in the same but \nalso the opposite brain hemisphere (including the area which is homotopic to the \nstimulated area). In fact it has been shown in a number of studies that TMS-induced \nactivity is transferred to connected area, including the homotopic area of the \ncontralateral hemisphere (Cracco, Amassian, Maccabee & Cracco, 1989; Ilmoniemi \net al., 1997; Komssi et al., 2002; Paus et al., 1997). However in a combined TMS-\nERP study, it was found that although stimulation over left motor cortex induced \nactivity in right-hemispheric sensorimotor areas, this activity was much smaller than \nthe activity in the left hemisphere (Nikulin, Kicicacute, Kahkonen & Ilmoniemi, 2003). \n - 22 - \nIt is therefore quite likely that the induced activity in the opposite hemisphere is too \nsmall to cause any disruption of processing and thus too small to cause any \nperformance deficits. The same might be true for area V5. This means that the \ntransfer of activity to the opposite hemisphere offers a possible, but at the moment \nnot very plausible explanation for the observed whole-field deficits after unilateral V5 \nstimulation.  \n \nAt least in our study a more plausible explanation for the lack of hemispace \ndifferences has to do with fact that subjects in our experiments were free to move \ntheir eyes. Since the object always started from a central position, it is quite likely that \nsubjects directed their eyes first towards that central start position, and then followed \nthe object with their eyes during the object\u2019s movement to the right or left. In this case \nthe object\u2019s image would always be near the centre of the visual field, and \nconsequently no hemispace differences should be expected.  \n \nFinally, we would like to return to the effect of V5-TMS on catching performance, and \nask more specifically what aspect of the visuomotor processing has been disrupted \nby interfering with V5\/MT+. In principle there are two sources of visual motion during \nthe catching task, which might have been affected by the interference with the \nprocessing in the visual motion area V5\/MT+. The first and more obvious source is \nthe moving target object, the second source is the movement of the hand during the \ncatching response.  \n \nThere are three arguments which suggest that it is not the interference with the \nperception of the moving hand (i.e. on-line visual feedback) that caused the catching \ndeficits. First, if the disruption of visual feedback were to blame for the catching \n - 23 - \ndeficits, then similar deficits should have been found in the reach-to-grasp task. This, \nhowever, was not the case. Secondly, we would expect that the deficits are only \nfound when visual feedback is provided. But in fact the TMS-induced catching deficits \nwere also found in the 100 ms condition; yet during that condition on-line visual \nfeedback was not available. Thirdly, we showed recently that visual feedback is not \nused in the control of catching behaviour (Schenk, Mair & Zihl, 2003). It would \ntherefore be difficult to explain the TMS-induced changes in catching behaviour, if \nTMS interferes primarily with the use of visual feedback. Furthermore it is possible to \nexamine the time-course of the reaching movement to look for changes which might \nbetray effects of TMS on the use of visual feedback. Changes in the time-course \nhave been described in a number of studies in which the effect of visual feedback \nwas examined. In particular it was found that the deceleration phase is relatively \nprolonged when visual feedback is withdrawn (for a review see: (Churchill et al., \n2000)). Thus, if we would find a TMS-induced increase in the deceleration phase, this \nmight indicate that the TMS has interfered with the use of visual feedback. However, \nno such TMS-induced prolongation of the deceleration phase was found. Taken \ntogether, our findings suggest that it is not the interference with the use of on-line \nvisual feedback, but with the perception of the target\u2019s movement that is responsible \nfor the observed V5-TMS effects.  \n \nMore specifically, we would like to suggest that it is the degradation of information on \nthe target\u2019s speed and not its movement direction that caused the TMS-induced \nchanges in catching speed. This reduction in catching speed most probably reflects \nan underestimation of the speed of the target object that is induced by interference \nwith V5. Such an underestimation of the speed of visual targets after damage to V5 \nhas been found both for patient LM (Hess et al., 1989; Zihl et al., 1991) and for \n - 24 - \npatients who suffered unilateral damage to V5 (Plant & Nakayama, 1993). Moreover, \nevidence from neurophysiological and behavioural studies suggest that V5 plays a \nunique role in velocity perception, but V5\u2019s contribution to the identification of \nunambiguous motion direction is much less essential. The range of velocities that are \nrepresented in V5 (Lagae et al., 1993; Maunsell & Van Essen, 1983; Mikami et al., \n1986; Rodman & Albright, 1987; Van Essen, 1985) extends to much higher values \nthan that for cells in either V1 (Newsome, Mikami & Wurtz, 1986; Orban, Kennedy & \nBullier, 1986) or V3 (Felleman & Van Essen, 1987). This means that disruption of V5 \ndisables the cell-population that codes higher velocities, such velocities are then \ncoded in lower-velocity cells in V1 or V3, and consequently velocity is \nunderestimated. In contrast faithful direction discrimination can be found not just in \nV5, but in many more visual areas including V1 and V3 (Van Essen, 1985). \nAccordingly, disruption of V5 will not lead to a significant deficit in the identification of \nthe direction of a single moving object. This has been confirmed in lesion studies \n(Baker et al., 1991; Hess et al., 1989; Shipp et al., 1994). We, therefore, would not \nexpect that V5-TMS causes deficits in the identification of the direction of the target \nobject in our catching task. However, it should be noted that for other types of \ndirection-discrimination tasks, which involve ambiguous stimuli (e.g. random \nkinematograms or so-called moving plaid patterns), V5 seems to make a unique \ncontribution. This has been found in single-unit studies (Movshon, Adelson, Gizzi & \nNewsome, 1985; Salzman & Britten, 1990; Snowden, Treue & Andersen, 1992), and \nhas been confirmed in lesion (Baker et al., 1991; Marcar, Zihl & Cowey, 1997) and \nTMS studies (Beckers & H\u00f6mberg, 1992; Beckers & Zeki, 1995).  \n \n - 25 - \nConclusions \nThe results from this study confirm that V5\/MT+ plays a role not just in perceptual but \nalso in visuomotor tasks that require the processing of visual motion information. It is \ninteresting that although anatomically V5\/MT+ is often regarded as part of the dorsal \nstream, most of the functional studies focussed on V5\u2019s role in purely perceptual \ntasks. Our results confirm that V5\/MT+ also plays a role in vision for action, and thus \nseems to contribute to both dorsal- and ventral-stream functions. V5\u2019s functional \ncontribution to the two streams is consistent with the well-established anatomical fact \nthat V5 projects to both areas of the dorsal and the ventral stream (Felleman & Van \nEssen, 1991).  \nThus, mostly this TMS-study confirms the findings from our earlier study with patient \nLM. There are, however also informative differences between the two studies. Most \nimportantly, the dependence on extended observation times that was found in patient \nLM, was not found as a consequence of disrupting V5\/MT+ by TMS. It seems that \nthis dependence is only found in the context of a chronic V5 deficit, and is therefore \nprobably not a direct effect of a V5 impairment, but an indirect effect of the long-term \nadaptation to the motion-blindness resulting from a chronic V5 lesion. This study \nalong with similar studies (Walsh et al., 1998) suggests that the comparison between \nthe effects of TMS and lesions may provide a method to discriminate between the \ndirect behavioural consequences of a lesion that reflect the loss of a specific brain \nmechanism, and the indirect consequences, which result from neural or behavioural \nchanges that take place in response to the lost brain capacity.  \n  \n \n - 26 - \nAcknowledgements \nThis work was supported by a grant from the Leverhulme Trust (Grant number: \nF\/00128\/O; Title: \u201cThe neural correlates of visual consciousness\u201d).  \n \nReferences \nAnstis, S.

To see this, it is necessary to compute the difference of \nRS in the different TMS conditions for each subject separately. This has been done to compute %TMS-effect.
