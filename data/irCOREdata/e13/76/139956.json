It identifies the role of the ideal goal in leadership and its\nimportance in developing the psychological aspect of leadership.\nFindings \u2013 The paper posits that leadership is a developmental process, which is based on the\ntype of choice a leader makes. While choice implies that two good options are always\navailable from which to select, one should make choices in accordance with his worldview,\nlooking for affiliation (i.e. the Theta worldview), or looking for achievement (i.e. the Lambda\nworldview). Consequently, leaders need to recognise that the choices they make for\norganisational activities have to fit their own worldview. Pursuing the fit between one\u2019s\nworldview and planned organisational activities ensures that leaders continuously improve\ntheir ethical behaviour. The paper concludes with the presentation of a dynamic theory of\nleadership, which is based on the assumption that one can only strive toward truly ethical\nleadership with the knowledge that this goal is beyond human capacity.\n2Research limitations\/implications \u2013 Being a theory-based exploration, the paper does not\nprovide empirical examples of how this theory might be applied in practice.\nOriginality\/value \u2013 The paper provides an example of a dynamic theory, introduces the\nconcept of Theta and Lambda worldviews and provides a better definition of leadership\nstrategy and tactics.\nArticle type \u2013 Conceptual paper\nKey words - Dynamic theory, leadership, leadership development, Theta worldview, Lambda\nworldview, worldview\nIntroduction\nScholars tend to hold two mutually exclusive views about leadership: one school of thought\nholds that leaders are born (Grint, 2000, Nietzsche, 1969) and that the qualities they embody\nare subconscious (Lowen, 1975) whilst the other posits that humans need to work hard to\ndevelop these qualities before they can emerge as leaders (Henrikson, 2006; Kakabadse and\nKakabadse, 1999; Kakabadse and Myers, 1996).\nThe \u2018great man\u2019 theory (Carlyle, 1841\/2007; James, 1880) exemplifies the former view and is\ninterested in the personality traits which leaders intrinsically possess (Kakabadse and\nKakabadse, 1999). This approach assumes that a \u2018great man\u2019 naturally holds the essential\nskills which allow him to perform as a leader. By identifying these essential traits, others can\nemulate them through simulated versions of leadership (Kenny and Zaccaro, 1983; Lawler,\n2005; Stogdill, 1948; Stogdill, 1982). When applying this approach, scholars analyse specific\ntasks or problems and provide leadership typologies for addressing them (Mullins, 2003;\nHersey and Blanchard, 1993; Bass and Avolo, 1990). Many scholars have explored the\n3behaviour of leaders, the impact of context or \u2018situation\u2019 on leadership (Yukl, 2006), the\nfunction of leadership (Shamir, 1995), as well as \u2018contingency\u2019 and dynamic processes\n(Baker, 2007; Fiedler, 1967). Both the behavioural perspective as well as the economic\nmodel examine leadership as a role whose purpose is to assist an organization to adapt. That\nis how an individual practicing leadership can help an organisation to affect adaptive change\n(Kotter, 1990; Heifetz, 1998; Nanus, 1995).\nThe developmental school of thought, on the other hand, seeks to understand the conscious\nsteps taken to become a leader. Rooted in existentialist phenomenology, it holds that human\ndevelopment as well as human history is created (i.e. \u2018caused\u2019) by our awareness of our own\nmortality (i.e. existential \u2018time\u2019) which shapes everyday lives as a continuous interpretation\nof experience of the past and expectation (i.e. \u2018anticipation\u2019) of the future (Koselleck, 2002,\n1985). In this case, personal life \u201cis a constant becoming through a constant intentionality of\ndevelopment\u201d (MacDonald, 2000, p.33), and human existence is centred on the idea of\npossibility where \u201che is always more than he is; his being is never complete at any given\nmoment\u201d (Sartre, 1973, p.32). This view suggests that articulations of one\u2019s experience and\nanticipation of the future are subject to interpretation and evolve over time (Nanus, 1995;\nMacDonald, 2000). The developmental school holds that leadership is grounded in\nexperience and reflected by the personal interpretation of specific meanings articulated by\ninconsistent uses of language (Kakabadse and Kakabadse, 1999). These, in turn, influence\nthe development of future perspectives (Alvesson and Svenningson, 2003). Although scholars\nargue that leaders should exhibit some needed personal qualities (e.g., Goleman, 1998;\nKotter, 1990; Zaleznik, 1977), the above list does not offer a comprehensive theory of what\nleadership entails, especially when these leadership qualities are not found in practice.\nMoreover, notwithstanding burgeoning academic endeavours in the field of leadership, we\nstill do not know why leadership calls for those qualities. However, our goal is not simply to\n4criticise existing views on leadership. Instead, we take leadership to be a process (Baker,\n2007) and present here a dynamic theory of leadership which refers to time (Ashforth et al.,\n2008). This theory will enable us to explain the process of leadership development,\nexplaining that the two opinions concerning leadership transformations are not at odds but\ncomplement each other. In addition, we will not only identify the gaps in the existing\nliterature and attempt to fill them, but also assess the relevance of the current literature.\nWe will develop our argument starting with some basics, first by explaining the theoretical\nmeaning of leadership and its application in practice. Next, we will examine some of the\nleadership qualities recognised by the literature as a context for arguing that the full\nembodiment of this list of qualities is beyond human reach. Consequently, we will expand on\nwhat leaders do in practice. We will introduce the two mutually exclusive worldviews of\nleaders, the Theta and the Lambda, from which leaders can choose and the three levels of\nactivity of leadership theory. We will follow this discussion by introducing the concept of\nideal leadership and then presenting a dynamic model of leadership theory. Leaders are few\nand not many are ready to face the challenges expected in this role. We will identify those\nchallenges. Finally, we will explain why leadership theory, which seems to be relevant to\nonly a few of us, is actually meaningful to us all.\nThe Theory of Leadership\nAdding to Kurt Lewin\u2019s (1945) observation that \u201cthere is nothing so practical as a good\ntheory,\u201d Whetten (2002) suggests that only a good theory is practical. Hence, we have two\nsuccessive goals: first, we should understand the components that comprise theory and\nsecond, we should incorporate this knowledge into the theory of leadership.\n5Like any theory, leadership theory has to answer to three key questions: what, why and how\n(Whetten, 2002). \u201cWhat\u201d refers to the constructs analysed, or the target of theorising; \u201chow\u201d\nexplains the methods we use to create interrelationships between constructs of the theory; and\n\u201cwhy\u201d represents the conceptual assumptions behind these relationships (Figure 1).\nFigure 1: The three components of theory\nSource: Mostovicz (2008)\nThus, in leadership theory the \u201cwhat\u201d represents the goal that the leader looks to attain, the\n\u201chow\u201d explains the way the leader reaches the goal, and the \u201cwhy\u201d explains the reasons\nbehind selecting this particular method for attaining the goal. However, we contend that\nwhile the literature into leadership deals with what leaders do or how they do it, it is silent\n6about the reasons for why leaders are motivated to pursue such activities. This paper seeks to\naddress this gap in leadership theory. However, for forwarding our explanation, we will first\ncritically review a selection of the literature into leadership that we will use as a context to\nour discussion.\nThe Leadership Timeline\nIn general, research into leadership has examined three different phases within the leadership\ntimeline: the past, the present, and the future. Respectively, they represent how leaders have\nbeen transformed, their social role, and how they identify and execute their purpose. As\nFigure 2 shows, the model is in line with Koselleck (2002; 1985), and it defines and captures\nhuman development fuelled by the vision of possibilities.\nFigure 2: The leader\u2019s timeline.\nSource: the authors\nThe past\nWho is the leader or what qualities do ideal leadership require?. One quality of a leader is\nself-awareness (Goleman, 1998, p.84), which we define as \u201chaving a deep understanding of\n7one's emotions, strengths, weaknesses, needs, and drives.\u201d By this definition, leaders should\nalso understand their own values and goals in order to express themselves accurately and\nopenly. This suggests that good leaders are able to clearly articulate their deepest emotions\nand life goals, a feat which psychological research suggests people find difficult (Niemeyer,\nAnderson and Stockton, 2001). Equally, people tend to incorrectly define their perceptions as\n\u201ctruth\u201d, which leads to emotional distortion (Mostovicz, Kakabadse and Kakabadse, 2008).\nIndividuals express a difference in their thinking and actions, as shown in the gap between\nwhat they say (\u201cespoused theory\u201d) and what they actually do (\u201ctheory in use\u201d) (Argyris and\nSch\u00f6n, 1978). Hence, the \u201cdeep understanding of one\u2019s emotions\u201d (Goleman, 1998, p. 84) is\nnever deep enough to bridge the gap between his intellectual understanding and his ability to\napply this emotional learning, since emotions are embedded in the subconscious. In his\nuprooting of traditional Western viewpoints on the subject, Freud (1948) concluded that the\nsubconscious determines personal preferences rather than the consciously pursued intellectual\nefforts. Freud\u2019s challenge also laid the foundation for a wider debate within intellectual\ncircles of the psychological origins of personal development (Lesser 1957).\nBesides lacking in self-awareness, humans also cannot act responsibly at all times as there\nwill always be some areas or times when we act automatically or hide behind rules and\ncustoms (Mostovicz and Kakabadse, 2008). Consequently, we cannot expect leaders who at\ntimes are unaware of their actions to act ethically. The inability led some researchers to\nrealise that while true ethics is beyond our perception, we can gain better insight by\ndeveloping dynamic models of flux (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990). Scholars who view ethics as a\nprocess rather than an end ( e.g., Ciulla, 2004a; 2004b; Caldwell et al., 2008; Flynn, 2008;\nHernandez, 2008; Liedtka, 2008; Verbos et al., 2007) pay attention to the deep, personally-\n8held virtues, which generally relate to flourishing, vital, meaningful life-purposes and their\nembodiment (Cameron, 2003; Manz et al., 2006; Knights and O'Leary, 2006; Weiner, 1993).\nScholars (Luthans and Avolio, 2003; Gardner et al, 2005; Yammarino et al, 2008) who argue\nfor the need to develop authentic leadership, Liedtka (2008), for example, call for a search for\nauthenticity by looking internally (Hernandez, 2008; Hardt, 1993) rather than externally as\nlogical, economics-driven theories of ethics advocate. L\u00e9vinas (1994) addresses this question\nby replacing the concept of authenticity with the idea of responsibility to the \u201cOther\u201d as the\nultimate ethical value.\nThe present\nThe present refers to the social environment inside which a leader acts. A trait commonly\nfound in leaders is empathy. Goleman (1988, p. 88) defines empathy as \u201cthe ability to\nunderstand the emotional makeup of other people\u201d and \u201cthe skill of treating people according\nto their emotional reactions.\u201d To empathise means to respect the other\u2019s goals and motives.\nBut because leaders are unclear about their own values and purpose, their ability to empathise\nwith those of others is equally constrained.\nWhile Goleman (1988, p. 88) identifies self-regulation, or \u201cthe ability to control or\nredirect disruptive impulses and moods and the propensity to suspend judgment - to think\nbefore acting\u201d, this supposed self-regulation or the ability to control emotions and think\nlogically is, at best, wishful thinking, since this introjected, non-autonomous self-regulation is\ninauthentic (Ryan and Brown, 2003) Thus, we not only are unable to control our\nsubconscious but also the impacts that our subconscious has on our actions (Ariely, 2008).\nThe future\nHumans need a purpose. As each person has his own individual personality, he therefore\nsearches for a unique purpose (Frankl, 1963). This assertion, so basic to Judaism, claims that\n9\u201cthe foundation of Judaism and the basis of all true religions is the realization that existence\nis purposeful, and that man has a purpose in life\u201d (Kaplan, 1979 ,p.1), and it is recognised\nnowadays by cognitive psychologists as well (e.g., Deci and Ryan, 2000; Pinker, 2003).\nWhile we cannot attain true purpose, man is aware that he has a purpose and should search\nfor it (Frankl, 1963). Hence, contrary to Mills (2003) who claims that this search for meaning\nis only a means for dealing with uncertainty, theorists perceive searching for a purpose (e.g.,\nFrankl, 1963; Kelly, 1955; Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995; Yamakage, 2000) as a goal.\nHowever, people tend to believe in their ability of reaching a purpose out of fear of\nimperfection (Pinker, 2003), resulting in frustration when they realise that they cannot attain\nthe purpose. This leads to the development of no\u00f6genici neuroses, or what others might call\nspiritual or existential neuroses (Frankl, 1963). They shed all striving for meaning and live a\nboring and meaningless life. Another prevailing option is to substitute the unattainable\npurpose with a reachable one, such as the \u201cAmerican dream\u201d (Adams, 2001), which only\ndelays the neurosis until people reach this attainable but wrong purpose.\nFocusing on the search for purpose as a goal requires maturity, one of the most important\nqualities of a leader (Zaleznik, 1977). Just as marathon runners are usually older than those\nwho run short distances, leaders\u2019 applied abilities improve with age because they have\nstronger mental stamina. Similarly, marathon runners have to struggle with an invisible target\nthat does not become visible for some time. Therefore, they run unconsciously (Frankl, 1975)\nand concern themselves less with the target and more with their own actions until the target\nbegins to reveal itself.\n10\nAnother trait which virtually all leaders have is motivation. Goleman (1998, p. 88) defines\nmotivation as a \u201cpassion to work for reasons that go beyond money and status\u201d and \u201ca\npropensity to pursue a goal with energy and persistence.\u201d However, how can leaders \u201cpursue\na goal\u201d when their purpose is unclear? Second, self-motivation is an ideal only as in reality,\none needs a measure of extrinsic provocation (Gagn\u00e9 and Deci, 2005). As a matter of fact,\nthose who fail to grasp this human inability to pursue a goal end up trying or thinking too\nhard and develop neuroses as a result (Frankl, 1963; Wilson and Schooler, 1991).\nWhat do leaders do?\nIf most of the leadership qualities mentioned above seem not to exist in reality, aspiring\nleaders may remain unaware of how to progress in their development. Literature has paid less\nattention to the role of leadership and instead has concentrated more on how leaders are\nfulfilling that role. Hence, we need to answer three questions: first, what the role of\nleadership is, second, what the role of nonexistent ideal leadership in practice is and lastly,\nwhat the role of all the traits that the literature into leadership identified in developing leaders\nis.\nLeadership is about making choices (Kouzes and Posner, 2003). Choice is a binary action\nthat divides options into two sets, the desired and the undesired ones, according to a higher\nprinciple or value (Rawls, 1999). Thus, a choice implies that while both options are equally\nvalid, one will choose according to a higher principle. Mostovicz (2008) posits that the way\npeople choose is a reflection of their worldview or the way they go about discovering their\n11\n\u201cideal self\u201d (Hinkle, 1965). We approach this discovery in one of two ways: by the need for\nachievement (the Lambda worldview) or by the need for affiliation (the Theta worldview).\nEach worldview has its unique characteristics. While the Thetas\u2019 motivation is socially\noriented and they look to affiliate with their society of choice (Pyszczynski et al. 2004;\nPyszczynski, Greenberg and Solomon, 1997), the Lambdas are individually motivated (Deci\nand Ryan, 2000). Consequently, their respective behaviour follows the fundamental\nmodalities of human existence (Bakan, 1966). Thetas\u2019 behaviour is toward communion and\nfocused on other people and relationships while Lambda\u2019s behaviour is toward agency and\nfocused on the self and autonomy. The different approaches seek different benefits. Thetas\ntry to build respect within their society of choice while Lambdas look for personal freedom\n(Mostovicz, 2008). While scholars argue that leaders should exhibit the personal quality of\nauthenticity (e.g., Goleman, 1998; Kotter, 1990; Zaleznik, 1977), Thetas and Lambdas differ\nin the way they relate to authenticity. While Thetas are concerned with truthfulness and\ndenounce fakes (Ciulla ,2004; Nanus ,1995; Pyszczynski, Greenberg and Solomon ,1997;\nPyszczynski et al. ,2004), Lambdas \u201care genuine and authentic, not a replica of someone\nelse\u201d (George et al. ,2007, p.129) and perceive authenticity as uniqueness, with negative\nviews of a \u201cme too\u201d practice (Bennis ,2004; Deci and Ryan ,2000; Ryan and Brown ,2003).\nFinally, the different worldviews have different ideas about what a true goal is. According to\nKaplan (1990), one relates to truth either as an objective or as a principle. If one relates to\ntruth as an objective, the goal is to unite with it, as the Thetas perceive. If, on the other hand,\none relates to truth as a principle, as a Lambda does, truth then creates a set of challenges or\nguidelines to live up to. This difference in perception of truth also explains why different\n12\nopinions exist about how leaders transform (Kakabadse and Kakabadse, 1999). To a Theta, a\ntrue leader is one who attained his objective or one who is able to act subconsciously (Lowen,\n1975) and naturally \u2013 a born leader (Grint, 2000; Nietzsche, 1969) while for a Lambda, a\ngenuine leader is one who follows meticulously a proper set of guidelines (Henrikson, 2006;\nKakabadse and Kakabadse, 1999; Kakabadse and Myers, 1996).\nThese two approaches clash fundamentally because the drive for achievement ends in\nseparating oneself from others (or making oneself unique), while its counterpart seeks to\naffiliate oneself with others and work in unison. Consequently, this tension can lead to\npersonal bias or a distortion of the paradox within leadership (Mostovicz et al., 2008). A\nTheta type tends to choose the alternative course of action whereby he dilutes the stakes by\nsubstituting a relative truthfulness for the ultimate truth or creates a lack of contrast by\nremoving a strongly desired choice. On the other hand, in the Lambda type, the learning\nparadox can cause one to lose his own personality and to seek collectivism or even fanaticism\nin extreme cases whereby one disrespects others\u2019 interpretation of truth or argues that it is\ninvalid (McGregor et al. 1998, see Frankl 1986, p.xxvi for a similar idea). Table 1 below\noutlines several of the characteristics which define these two worldviews and how they\napproach their practice of leadership.\nTable 1: Leadership Characteristics of Theta (\uf051\uf029 and Lambda (\uf051) worldviews \nTheta (\uf051\uf029 Lambda (\uf051\uf029\nMotivation\/reason Socially oriented Personally oriented\nGoal Seeking unity and certainty\nSeeking challenge and\ncreation\n13\nBehaviour Communion Agency\nBenefit Building respect\nLooking for personal\nfreedom\nLeadership\nPrinciple\nAuthenticity = truthfulness Authenticity = genuineness\nInclination Toward choice Toward contrast\nPerception of truth As an objective As a set of rules\nTransformation of\na leader\nA leader is born. Qualities\nare subconscious.\nA leader is developed\nconsciously.\nSource: the authors\nIncorporating both approaches is paradoxical because this requires one to relate to the other\ndespite being motivated in a different way (Mostovicz et al., 2008). This paradox creates an\nethical problem because it implies that the leader is supposed to view a clashing code of\nconduct as both a proper and a good conduct yet also as unethical. Moreover, it begs the\nquestion of how one can perceive two opposing conducts as equally ethical.\nHence, leadership consists of three levels (Table 2). The lower level consists of the many\ntactics or actions (Amir and Ariely, 2007) that are based on the Theta\/Lambda principles. As\nsuch, these actions are logical, rational, conscious, measurable and replicable, and their\nguiding discipline is economics. Strategy is a matter of interpretation and often involves the\nmaking of choices (Porter 1996), which are themselves paradoxical (Mostovicz et al., 2008).\nThis is the level of practical leadership that we characterise as emotional, unconscious,\nirrational and immeasurable and whose guiding discipline is psychology. However, this level\n14\nis properly performed only when it is embedded in true purpose and its leading discipline is\nof metaphysics. While man cannot perceive truth, he is able to progress toward it.\nNevertheless, he has to progress naturally and faithfully according to his worldview, which\ncan be of a Theta or a Lambda type.\nTable 2: The Three Components of Leadership Theory\nTheory question How?

Theories that scholars considered\ncorrect in the past have become invalid over time (Pascale, 1990; Kalogeras, 2005).\nConsequently, social science, in general, and the process of leadership (Baker, 2007), in\nparticular, are looking for dynamic theories.\nIdeal leadership and ethics share one thing in common, neither the former nor the latter is to\nbe found in man. Nevertheless, as such, they present an ideal for anchoring leadership theory.\n15\nWeber (1947) and Hekman (1983) use the term \u201cideal\u201d only as an aid to assist in explaining\npatterns of social interaction, institutional design and the way we govern ourselves (Cutting\nand Kouzmin, 2000). Hence, \u201cideal\u201d does not try to describe a particular behaviour but looks\nto capture the logic of reality we use meaningfully as an inspirational benchmark. We expand\nbeyond this normative approach and view the ideal type or the ethical leader as a particular\nentity and argue that this ideal is not a passive and static benchmark for measuring our\nsuccess, but an active and dynamic part of the leadership theory. Unable to reach the ideal,\nthe pursuit of ideal leadership is guaranteed to fail, yet it assures the dynamic and successful\ndevelopment of the leader.\nWhile the metaphysical ideal serves as an anchor for guaranteeing a leader\u2019s dynamic\ndevelopment, a leader gets closer to that ideal either by following the Theta or the Lambda\npattern according to his worldview. Nevertheless, we must express this worldview in tactical\nactions that fit (Porter, 1996) the particular worldview (Figure 3). However, as we will\nexplain, tactics have a dual role. Not only do we use them as a means of expression of the\nleader\u2019s strategy, but as a mirror that reflects the bitter truth to the leader, telling him what he\nis not doing properly.\n16\nFigure 3: The Dynamic Theory of Leadership Development\nStrategy\nTactics\nUnreachable\nTrue Purpose\nSource: the authors\nWe believe that the selection of our tactical goals is based on logic. Nevertheless, Porter\n(1996) reminds us that we should not account for all actions since these actions should fit our\nstrategic view. According to this approach, the tactical goals are the independent variables\nthat dictate to us what to do while the strategic view helps us to select those goals more\nsuitable to our capabilities. Inherently, this approach suffers from what might be called\n\u201cobjectivity fallacy\u201d or the belief that we are able to collect data or define tactical goals\nobjectively. However, we select subjectively only the data that fits our worldview\n(Mostovicz, 2008; Mostovicz, Kakabadse and kakabadse, 2008). Thus, the tactical activities\nare dependent variables only. Hence, leadership development starts with clarifying the\n17\nemotional, strategic worldview first before defining those tactical methods that can enhance\nthe strategy.\nThe leadership challenge\nWhy are there so few leaders? In Kakabadse and Kakabadse\u2019s (2007) study, only a handful of\npeople in leadership positions actually led while the vast majority acted reactively, either\nseeing their role as pleasing the shareholders or being concerned with their reputation. Not\nonly were there not enough leaders to fill existing leadership slots in management, but the\ngaps are even greater as some leaders decline to practice their leadership in the field of\nbusiness management (Goffee and Jones, 2000). The result is that filling these leadership\nroles is a huge challenge.\nLeadership calls for total commitment to the perpetual process of purpose seeking. While\nleaders are usually concerned with their legacies, their commitment to purpose has to go far\ndeeper. It is not simply how a leader has lived his life but how he has defined a purpose for\nwhich he would have been ready to die if it could not have been pursued (L\u00e9vinas 1994). This\ntotal commitment implies that, in reality, leaders seek \u2018either my way or nothing.\u2019 However,\nthis commitment is intrinsic; it calls for the leader to mobilise himself, body and soul, but in\nno way does it imply extrinsically that what is not \u201cmy way\u201d is wrong.\nThis total commitment is not easy. The only tool left at the leader\u2019s disposal is motivation,\nwhich implies flux. A leader should be constantly on the move, trying to achieve the\nunachievable and relating to what looks like a means as a life goal. However, as this\n18\nmotivation is always extrinsically triggered (Gagn\u00e9 and Deci, 2005), it does not happen\nregularly, and a good leader should seek that extrinsic motivation constantly and even\nprovoke it (Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995).\nA leader faces a challenge at the strategic level as well. It is not enough to pursue a goal and a\nleader has to follow it strictly according to his worldview while respecting the other\u2019s\nworldview. This respect of the other is empathy or what Lorenz (1974) calls a bond\nassociated with being both non-hierarchical and non-distancing. When leaders bond socially,\nthey need to send a message that humans all share a common existence and a lack of self-\nawareness of the ethics required to search for a true purpose. While establishing empathy is a\nmomentary act based on a complex unconscious process (Wilson, 2002), leaders are aware of\nthis but try to unmask it or try to be more aware of themselves.\nEmpathy requires three qualities: avoidance of distancing, respect for the integrity of the\nother and harmonious aggression (Ohshima, 1998). We can only achieve harmony by setting\nboundaries around the aggressive act while signalling respect for the adversary\u2019s integrity\n(Funakoshi, 1973). This ability to manage a spectrum of aggression may not be unique to\nhumans. As Lorenz (1974) has pointed out, members of a given animal species also find it\nimportant to keep their aggression intact and to learn to avoid potentially dangerous\nrepercussions by means of diverting mechanisms.\nHowever, proper empathy or being ethical is trying to hold the stick at both ends and tends to\nlead to paradoxical distortion (Mostovicz et al., 2008) that the leader needs to fight\n19\nconstantly. Empathy is the reconciliation between the closeness of responsibility and the\ndistancing as defined by the Other (L\u00e9vinas, 1994). We can only strive to reach this ideal but\nwe will never attain it.\nFinally, the tactical level has its challenges as well. While an organisation has one leader only\nto dictate its future direction, many fall into the trap of transactional leadership where they\nbase their leadership on formal authority (Kakabadse and Kakabadse, 1999). Such behaviour\nis based on the logic of self-regulation while leadership should be based on a voluntary\nemotional concession of any competing goals by others in the organisation (Murnighan and\nConlon, 1991). Thus, instead of mistakenly marginalising individual experience in the search\nfor overall homogeneity, a leader should learn to \"play through\" (Murnighan and Conlon,\n1991) any differences that individuals may have so that he does not deny \u201cthe right of\nindividual people to have and interpret their own experience\u201d (Cheng, 1995 ,p.5).\nConclusion\nIdeal leaders do not exist in practice. Thus, we can relate to leadership as a progressive\ndevelopment only. Since humans cannot be fully conscious of our emotions, a posteriori, we\ncannot fully mobilise them in order to understand and attain our life goals and purpose.\nBecause our purpose remains opaque at best, it follows that leaders will act unethically even\nwhen they do so unwillingly or unconsciously. The only way for leaders to improve their\nethical position is to interact with others in society to help them reveal their hidden agenda\nover time. The particular worldview, in turn, shapes these agendas, either Theta or Lambda,\n20\nthat a person embodies in his search for greater self-awareness and contextualisation with his\nexternal environment.\nReferences\nAdams, J.T.
