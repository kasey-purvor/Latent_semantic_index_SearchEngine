It is argued that our position regarding \nchildren\u2019s creativity steams from larger systems of representation concerning children on \nthe one hand, and creativity on the other. Arguments for and against the idea that \nchildren can be creative are then considered from four different perspectives: the product, \nprocess, person and press factor. On the whole, children\u2019s creativity is accounted for in \nterms of a particular \u2018reading\u2019 of children as active and interactive beings and of creativity \nas a social and cultural phenomenon. In contrast, children\u2019s lack of creative expression is \nlinked with a passive and receptive image of the child and with theorising creativity \nthrough the lenses of the genius and of great creations. In the end, the benefits of \nacknowledging children\u2019s creativity are considered for child and developmental \npsychology, for creativity research and for educational practices.    \n  \nKey-words: children, creativity, culture, development      \n \n \n \n\u201cElectricity is not only present in a magnificent thunderstorm and \ndazzling lightning, but also in a lamp; so also, creativity exists not \nonly where it creates great historical works, but also everywhere \nhuman imagination combines, changes, and creates anything \nnew\u201d (Vygotsky, 1930\/1967, cited in Smolucha, 1992, p. 54) \n \n \n \nIt could come as a surprise maybe for some that the connection between children and \ncreativity can end in a question mark. Children play, sing, dance, draw, tell stories and \nmake up riddles in such a natural, spontaneous and creative way that it goes without \nsaying that there is such a thing as \u2018children\u2019s creativity\u2019. In fact, some would argue, \nchildren are the mere embodiment of human creativity. In a recent survey of \nlaypeople\u2019s representations of creativity (Author, under review), respondents were \nasked to rate and comment on different symbols that can potentially represent the \nessence of being creative. Findings revealed that \u2018children\u2019s drawings\u2019 for example \nwas found by most participants to be a good or very good creativity symbol. A variety \nof reasons were offered for why this was the case, and among them the idea \nrepeatedly came up that \u201cthe child within all of us is the part which longs to create \nand come up with answers to all things\u201d. In the collective imaginary (of people from \nthe Western world and our present day at least) there seems to be a strongly held \nconviction that children are much more free and creative in their expression than \nadults. This theme has been well reflected in psychology too, in the work of several \ndistinguished authors. Freud (1908\/1970) himself compared the playing child with the \ncreative writer. And yet, these kinds of understandings need to be historically situated. \nAs Gardner (1982) rightfully pointed out, in centuries past, the association between \nchildren and art would have been easily dismissed. For it is \u201cour romantic tradition, \nremolded in terms of a modernist ethos, [that] has made us responsive to the notion of \nthe child as artist, and the child in every artist\u201d (Gardner, 1982, p. 92). Can this tradition \nbe said to mould contemporary psychology as well? \n \nThe proper answer here would be \u2018yes and no\u2019. Yes if we look at today\u2019s growing \nliterature dedicated to measuring the \u2018creative potential\u2019 of children, its ups and \ndowns through different developmental stages, the practical ways in which it could be \nenhanced, etc. At a theoretical level though there is considerable scepticism whether \ncreativity, as defined by modern science, can be applied to children and the reasons \nfor this are not altogether dismissible. To continue with Gardner\u2019s (1982, p. 142) analysis \nof the child and her art, he cautiously remarked that experimental evidence does not \nsupport the \u201ceasy assumption that the young child is an artist\u201d. Feldman, another \nacclaimed developmentalist and creativity researcher, warned at some point (in \nSawyer et al., 2003, p. 219) about the tendency to \u2018romanticise childhood\u2019 by \nexaggerating the creative value of children\u2019s products. Equally reserved, Duke stated \nthat children \u2018art\u2019 can\u2019t be called creative; it is \u201cthe first step of a creative process, but \nfew children go beyond this first step in a journey that may demand 10 or 100 steps\u201d \n(Duke, 1973, p. 8). What transpires here is the way in which a common-sense truism can \ntrouble psychologists. The taken-for-grantedness of children\u2019s creativity doesn\u2019t seem to \nhold its ground when scientific definitions and methods are trying to unpack it. In the \nend, it is questionable whether children can live up to, little less embody, the traditional \nidealised image of what it means to be \u2018truly\u2019 creative. \n \nThe notion of creativity in both science and common-sense thinking draws on a \npowerful legacy of the \u2018genius\u2019 or the \u2018Great Creator\u2019. The history of this concept is \nridden by dichotomies between creative and uncreative, extraordinary and ordinary, \nexceptional and banal, art or science and everyday life, art and craft, and so on. \nThere are strong ideological barriers safeguarding the realm of creativity against those \nwho are deemed unable of \u2018true\u2019 creative expression. Among these we generally find \nall animals, the mad, and children. As Feldhusen (2002, p. 179) notes, \u201ccreativity is a \nphenomenon that is most often and successfully researched and understood at its high \nlevel, less frequently as exhibited by average people and\/or children\u201d. At best, children \ncan be given a secondary role, at the periphery of creative expression, and be \n \n2\nacknowledged for their \u201clow-range creativity\u201d (Feldman in Sawyer et al., 2003, p. 219). \nThis is furthermore suggested by distinctions such as those between \u2018mature\u2019 and \n\u2018mundane\u2019 creativity (see Cohen and Ambrose, 1999, p. 9). The first type is the most \nvaluable, leading to the transformation of a field and, as its name implies, it is reserved \nfor adulthood. The second, also named \u2018creativity in the small\u2019, brings about the new \nat an individual, not societal level. Under these conditions, it is hardly surprising how a \ndebate between scholars about the impact of society on children\u2019s natural creativity \nended with the following conclusion:  \n \n\u201cWe came to a consensus that children are not really creative, given the \ndefinitions of creativity that are necessary to explain the important and influential \ninnovations that have impacted our lives. Some of us are willing to retain a \nresidual notion of small c creativity \u2013 the everyday cleverness that makes us smile \nor makes life easier \u2013 for the novel, unusual actions of children, but we all \ndistinguish this from big C Creativity, the creation of culture-transforming \nproducts that is found only in adults\u201d (Sawyer in Sawyer et al., 2003, p. 240). \n \nThis article aims to challenge such a conclusion. It will do so not by engaging with \nparticular pieces of empirical data or by claiming the falseness of separating children \nand creativity. On the contrary, this view will be considered as legitimate in its own \nright. What the present paper will examine are the epistemological reasons for \nsupporting and\/or contesting children\u2019s creativity, considering them as symptomatic of \ndeep-seated assumptions concerning children and creativity. From a constructionist \nstandpoint, both sides of the debate are equally \u2018valid\u2019 in their efforts to convince us of \na certain \u2018reality\u2019. Nevertheless, they have important practical consequences (for \ntheory, for research, for education, etc.) and as such cannot and should not be \nequally supported. Some will undoubtedly be outraged by the perspective of \nconsidering the \u2018constructed\u2019 nature of our science, be it developmental or creativity \npsychology, and of raising (or perhaps lowering) the discussion from the level of facts to \nthat of narratives about facts. To those I respond with Jerome Bruner\u2019s reflection that \n\u201cany story we tell about human infancy grows as much out of ideological convictions \nand cultural beliefs as out of observation\u201d (Bruner, 1986, p. 134). There is great value in \nscrutinising these ideological convictions and cultural beliefs since, in our case, the \n\u2018stories\u2019 we tell about children\u2019s creativity are born out of \u2018stories\u2019 we tell about children \nand about creativity in themselves. As such, the presentation will start with a brief \nconsideration of these \u2018background narratives\u2019. Following this, a review of arguments \nfor why children are (or are not) creative will be offered, paying particular attention to \nhow this debate both steams from and informs contemporary shifts in developmental \npsychology and creativity research. Finally, and in light of this analysis, the case will be \nmade for why we should \u2018bet\u2019 on children\u2019s creativity as the more fertile starting point \nfor a contemporary perspective on children, creativity, and education.       \n \n3\n \n1. Making sense of children and childhood   \n \nUsually one thinks of making sense as something we engage in when we are \nconfronted with an alien and mysterious reality. This description applies to a great \nextent to our efforts to know the human child, despite the fact that we all were one to \nbegin with. Beautifully capturing this paradox, Kennedy (2008, p. 1) writes: \u201cChildhood is \nboth the most deeply familiar moment of the human life cycle and the great \nunknown\u201d. The fact that we were once children, but we are not anymore, doesn\u2019t \nmake much easier the task of comprehending childhood as it is. Our knowledge of it \nwill always be bound to our position in the world in relation to it, as adults. The \nadultcentrism of our theories is a characteristic that is here to stay and something we \ncan\u2019t correct but should more consistently acknowledge. The child is, in the end, \nsimultaneously a historical, cultural, political, economic, social, and scientific \nproduction (Denzin, 1977). Definitions of childhood, as Burman (1994) observes, are \nalways relational in nature, making reference to parents, families, the State, etc. \nMoreover, they are never inconsequential for how we come to define ourselves as non-\nchildren. As Burman (1994, p. 48) continues to argue, \u201cdiscourses of childhood (\u2026) are \npart of the cultural narratives that define who we are, why we are the way we are and \nwhere we are going\u201d. \n \nUnsurprisingly, childhood as a \u201csocial invention\u201d (Valentine, 2004, p. 2) has a history, one \nthat is more recent than what we commonly believe. In his seminal work on historical \nrepresentations of children and childhood, Ari\u00e8s (1962) demonstrated that this \nparticular age was \u2018absent\u2019 as a concept in the Middle Ages and only started \nemerging in the upper classes in the 16th and 17th centuries. Of course children existed \nbefore that time but they were not seen as such, but rather like miniature adults. And \neven after they finally \u2018materialised\u2019, children went through a series of different \n\u2018incarnations\u2019 before becoming the complex beings they are (considered) today. From \nthe innocent and pure creature of the 17th century, to the emblematic sign of \nRomanticism in late 18th century, and up to the instinctual and sexual organism of 20th \ncentury psychoanalysis, the child transformed in unison with the social, cultural and \npolitical worldviews of the time. As David Kennedy (2006, p. 5) concludes: \u201cCaught \nbetween divinity and animality, between what is and what it might be, it is the child \nwho mediates the human possibility\u201d. Indeed, children represent a space of possibility, \na space of projection and constant re-presentation for all adult \u2018outsiders\u2019. \n \nWhat is projected onto the child is not always positive though. As a matter of fact, \nthere is a pervasive tendency, arguably across historical times and geographical \nplaces, to define children in negative terms: not by what they are and have, but by \nwhat they are not and don\u2019t have yet (Alanen, 1990, p. 16). And there are many things \n \n4\nadults (psychologists included) consider the child not to have. Analysing dominant \nconceptions, Vygotsky (1987, p. 53) made the same observation, pointing to how \nresearch is absorbed by an ethos of finding the \u201cflaws, inadequacies, and limitations\u201d \nof the child\u2019s thinking, rather than her capabilities. In the words of D\u2019Alessio (1990, p. \n70), \u201cthe idea of the unfinishedness of the child has long provided the basis for theories \nof child development\u201d. This conception stands at the basis of what can be called a \n\u2018deficit model\u2019 (see Shaw, 1996) of the child, one portraying children as less able, less \ndeveloped and less experienced. Obviously, this calls for a comparison term and the \ncomparison term is always the adult. Prout and James (1997) explored the roots of this \ngeneral dichotomy and its associated symbolism. What this revealed is a general \nopposition between children as \u2018nature\u2019, \u2018simple\u2019, \u2018amoral\u2019, \u2018asocial\u2019 and \u2018person-in-\nwaiting\u2019 and adults as \u2018culture\u2019, \u2018complex\u2019, \u2018moral\u2019, \u2018social\u2019, and \u2018personhood\u2019; in other \nwords, a dichotomy between children\u2019s \u2018becoming\u2019 and adult\u2019s \u2018being\u2019. \n \nAnd yet, psychology has come a long way in how it conceptualises children and \nchildhood as a stage of development. From a traditional image of the passive and \nresponsive child, especially at very low ages, theory has gradually moved to a \ndepiction of the \u201cinformationally active, socially interactive infant mind\u201d (Bruner, 1999, \np. 230). A regained appreciation for the child\u2019s capacity to understand and \nmanipulate the world, to act both towards the self and others, and generally to go \nbeyond the \u2018here and now\u2019 of experience, was prompted by current investigations of \nthe symbolic function and its genesis. This is not a new interest but one that remained \ndormant under decades of behaviourism. The focus on the symbolic function is by no \nmeans irrelevant for our discussion of children\u2019s creativity. In fact, the story of \u2018creativity\u2019 \nis largely considered to begin with the first symbolically mediated actions of the child:      \n \n\u201cUnlike other animals and unlike the infant during the first year of life, the child of \ntwo has clearly entered the realm of symbolic activity. (...) He may eat \nsymbolically, using pretense gestures and pretend food. Moreover, such \nsymbolic enactments are carried out seemingly for the sheer enjoyment of \nrepresentational activity. There is no ulterior motive \u2013 unless one wants to count \nincreased knowledge of the world and more effective communication about it. \nNeedless to stress, this achievement of symbolic activity is enormous \u2013 in a sense, \nthe greatest imaginative leap of all. Upon it will be constructed all subsequent \nforms of play, including play of literary imagination\u201d (Gardner, 1982, p. 170).   \n \nIn conclusion, our historical and societal relationship to the \u2018child\u2019 \u2013 transcending the \nspecifics of our interactions with particular children \u2013 was and continues to be marked \nby ambivalence (see Sommerville, 1982, p. 288). Children are, it seems, innocent, \nvulnerable and lovable, but they can also be disrupting, menacing and unpredictable \n(Burman, 1994; Valentine, 2004). As such, they require education, protection and a \n \n5\nwatchful surveillance on the part of the adult. A similar ambivalence can be said to \ndescribe our understanding of children\u2019s creativity. Whether children are indeed \ncreative or not, whether being creative is good or not for them, it is hard to evaluate \nwithout uncovering the second piece of the puzzle: the meaning of creativity.       \n \n2. Making sense of creators and creativity   \n \nCreativity can be regarded as anther \u2018great unknown\u2019 for both scientists and \nlaypeople. Explaining how novelty comes about is perhaps one of the most \nchallenging tasks psychologists are facing, and this is even more so if this novelty is \ngenerated by children. Despite all the potential interpretations one can give to the \nterms \u2018creative\u2019 and \u2018creativity\u2019, there is today a surprisingly high consensus in the \nliterature that creative products are new and \u201caccepted as tenable or useful or \nsatisfying by a group in some point in time\u201d (Stein, 1953, p. 311). It is also what Wegerif \n(2010, p. 51) referred to as \u2018creativity 1\u2019, the playfulness of coming up with new ideas, \nand \u2018creativity 2\u2019, focused on creating something of value. This double criterion of \noriginality and value constitutes the core of a scientific approach to creativity but it is \nimportant not to forget that, behind its relative simplicity, one can find a complex \nhistory of thinking about creation, from Antiquity onwards (see Sternberg and Lubart, \n1999). Of course, the term \u2018creativity\u2019 itself has been with us for a considerably shorter \nperiod of time and has gained widespread usage only in the 20th century. Similarly, the \nenthusiasm for what it means can be said to have emerge fully, in the Western society \nat least, after the half of the last century (see Weiner, 2000).  \n \nIt is hard to summarise centuries of thought on creativity and this will not even be \nattempted here. What needs to be highlighted though is the fact that explanations for \nboth the capacity to generate novelty and the appreciation for it varied according to \nhistorical times, reflecting the main concerns and conceptions of the day. If in pre-\nRenaissance the notion of creation was associated strictly with God and creative work \nwas linked to divine inspiration, the ages that followed started forging a deep \nconnection between creativity and genetic inheritance (Dacey, 1999, p. 310). Two \nbroad models of creativity gradually emerged, supported by the zeitgeist of \nRomanticism and, respectively, the Enlightenment (see also Liep, 2001). The artist and \nthe scientist, the two classical faces of the \u2018creator\u2019, have shaped and continue to \nshape our collective imaginary of what it means to be a creative person. Importantly \nfor our argument here, the modern admiration for art and science as high forms of \nhuman achievement has largely been built on a separation between them and the \nprocesses of everyday living (see Dewey, 1934, for a discussion about art). Children\u2019s \ncreative expression, an intrinsic part of the latter, also pales in comparison to the \nbreakthroughs of acclaimed artists and prolific scientists. \n \n \n6\nThis leads us to the conclusion that there are many possible \u2018readings\u2019 of creativity and \nthey can be found equally in scientific and popular discourses. The most prominent of \nthese, spread across historical times up to the present day, steams from an association \nbetween creativity and genius. The towering figure of the genius, with its overtones of \n\u201cindividuality, insight, outstanding ability and, in particular, fertility\u201d (Mason, 2003, p.111), \nlargely contributed to the rupture mentioned above between \u2018creating\u2019 and \u2018living\u2019. \nGeniuses are rare, they are special, they stand apart from society and their role is to \nrevolutionise it, to radically change our perspective of the world, usually for the better. \nThe vast majority of us (children included in their totality), cannot aspire to this. \nNevertheless, the paradigm of the genius did not remain unchallenged. The \npsychology of the 1950s contributed greatly to imposing a new perspective on \ncreativity, one in which each and every individual is creative (albeit to different \ndegrees) and this capacity we are born with can and should be educated. Under this \nvision children gained their \u2018right\u2019 to creativity, however modest its expression might be. \nStill, the mainstream psychological theory of creativity, for as progressive as it seems \ncompared to the claustrophobic vision of the genius, on the whole failed to \nacknowledge the social and cultural embeddedness of creative work. Creativity does \nnot spur from nowhere (as in the case of the genius), or from the individual alone (as \ncognitive models propose), but exists in between self and others, creator and \naudience, individual and community. The We-paradigm of creativity (see Gl\u0103veanu, \n2010a), gaining momentum in contemporary debates, considers creativity a \ncollaborative and intersubjective enterprise.  \n \nTo summarise, creativity is a second term enjoying a very rich legacy of meanings and \ninterpretations. The most pervasive of them until now has been the genius approach, a \n\u2018romantic model\u2019 (Sefton-Green, 2000, p. 220) rooted in the exceptional creative \npowers of the (male and adult) creator. More \u2018cultural\u2019 readings of creativity, on the \nother hand, strive to reconnect it with the processes of everyday community life. The \nnotion of children\u2019s creativity is just one of the many points of fracture between these \ntwo approaches. To understand better the arguments of both sides we need to have a \ncloser and more systematic look at what qualifies children as creative, or uncreative.  \n                \n3. The creative child? Junctions and disjunctions    \n \nTo organise our inquiry into if and why children can be considered creative, the \nfollowing discussion will be built around the \u2018canonical\u2019 four Ps of creativity theory and \nresearch: Product, Process, Person and Press (or \u2018pressure\u2019; the environment, mostly \nsocial but not exclusively). Originally established by Rhodes (1961\/1987), this framework \nand its categories are widespread and have the advantage of structuring a rather \nmultifaceted phenomenon. On the downside, as Barron (1995, p. 32) noticed, a strict \nseparation between product, process and person can only be an oversimplification, \n \n7\nsince in reality the three stand as interconnected in every creative activity. For the \npurposes of our analysis though, this particular segmentation helps accentuate two \ncontrasting notions of children and creativity and their immediate implications.       \n \n3.1. The product perspective  \n \nAs previously noticed, our contemporary psychology of creativity is founded on the \nstudy of creative products. This focus on products is justifiable from a scientific \nperspective: products \u2013 like paintings, inventions, mathematical demonstrations, \ndesigner objects, and so on \u2013 are readily available for evaluation, even measurement. \nTheir originality is there to be observed and judged and their value becomes apparent \nwhen products are incorporated in current social practices. \u2018Creative\u2019 products are \noriginal in the sense that there is a distance between them and what (we know) existed \nbefore them. They have an air of spontaneity, novelty, and generate surprise and \ncuriosity in their viewers. From this perspective at least, children\u2019s productions can be \ncatalogued as creative. The way young children depict the world, especially at a pre-\nschool age, is a constant source of amazement and delight for parents and teachers, \nfor adults as a whole. Their \u2018freshness\u2019 of perspective, their \u2018boldness\u2019 in breaking with \nrealism and \u2018easiness\u2019 to disregard social conventions makes children\u2019s drawings, for \nexample, a perfect illustration of what \u2018creativity\u2019 really is. It is no wonder then that the \ngreat Pablo Picasso allegedly said \"It took me four years to paint like Raphael, but a \nlifetime to paint like a child\". Modern art, in its present form, greatly embraces child-like \nplayfulness and experimentation. \n \nAnd yet we have virtually no child artists, in the sense Picasso was. Children may draw \nand paint and tell stories but their drawings and stories, enmeshed in the flow of \neveryday life, are easily lost and have no particular value for society. At best, children \ncome to \u2018re-invent\u2019 things or ideas we already have and know. Except for the micro-\nuniverse of the child and her family, children\u2019s expression is worthless at a historical \nscale. And the historical scale is, as we well remember form before, one crucial point of \nfocus for \u2018romantic\u2019 or \u2018genius\u2019 readings of creativity (Stein, 1953, p. 311). Even when \n\u2018child geniuses\u2019 are discovered, as examples of extreme giftedness, their present works \nare appreciated in anticipation of future greater achievement, presumably reserved \nfor when they become adults (prophecies that are seldom turned into reality...). On the \nwhole though, much of what \u2018ordinary children\u2019 do and say is never really captured in \nthe form of tangible products and, even when this is the case, it is rarely that these \nproducts survive the day.     \n \nThis raises a very interesting point of reflection for creativity researchers. If we restrict \ncreativity to products we are bound to miss out on much of what creativity is or can be. \nNot only is the case that creativity commonly manifests itself as a process, but also that \n \n8\nattempts at inferring the creative process from product alone are bound to be as \nsuccessful as trying to turn fossils into living and breathing creatures. The \u2018product bias\u2019 \n(Runco, 2007, p. 384) needs to be more consistently addressed and there are signs of \nclear dissatisfaction with it. Researchers such as Keith Sawyer (2000) have been \npointing for several years to the importance of performance and improvisation. This line \nof inquiry would presumably be much more fertile for recognising and understanding \nchildren\u2019s creativity and not only. In the words of Sawyer:  \n \n\u201cBecause performance, particularly in the more improvisational genres, is \nephemeral and does not generate any lasting ostensible product, it has been \neasy to neglect. Even though performance has rarely been a subject for \ncreativity research, it may actually represent a more common, more accessible \nform of creativity than privileged domains such as the arts and sciences. If one \nrecognizes that all social interactions display improvisational elements, then \neveryday activities such as conversations also become relevant to creativity \ntheory\u201d (Sawyer, 1997, p. 2). \n \n3.2. The process perspective  \n \nIn the previous section it was suggested that a process rather than a product \norientation would be much more adequate for our understanding of creativity, \nincluding the creativity of children and ordinary people. And yet, upon closer scrutiny, \nhow sure are we that children\u2019s internal and external processes and activities can be \ncatalogued as \u2018creative\u2019? On the surface at least there seem to be clear parallels \nbetween the child\u2019s play and the creator\u2019s work. Gardner (1982, p. 90), for instance, \npointed to several reasons why child and artist belong to the same category. On the \none had the enjoyment of the task is obvious in both cases, and also a willingness to \ndisregard common conventions. Also, both children and artists, as well as creators at \nlarge, employ a series of means allowing them to comprehend and express ideas and \nemotions. Engel (1993) advocated for a similar position referring to the expressiveness of \nchildren\u2019s play and the experiential aspect of being creative. The discovery of the fact \nthat blue and yellow make up green is accompanied by the same intense emotions \nthat adult creators have in their famous Eureka moments. And yet, many of these \npoints, as the authors who formulate them acknowledge, are open to contestation. \nDoes a child\u2019s enjoyment come from the real awareness of what she has created? \nDoes her apparent disregard of norms and traditions reflect any knowledge of what this \nmeans? Is the experience of invention understood the same? \n \nAll of these questions point to one major aspect that seems to characterise the adult\u2019s \ncreative process but not the child\u2019s, and that is intentionality. In the general literature \non creativity this aspect, implying goal-direct and conscious action, is gaining more \n \n9\nand more interest. Creativity, many claim, needs to integrate the intentional aspect \notherwise we would be left with considering dreams or accidents as creative, which \nsounds unacceptable. As Weisberg (1993, p. 243) clearly states, \u201cnovelty brought about \nby accident would not qualify as creative, no matter how valuable the outcome\u201d. He \nemphasises this point to the extent of proposing that \u2018goal-directed novelty\u2019 should be \nintegrated in our conventional definition of creativity. This is also supported by authors \nlike Gruber and Wallace (1999, p. 94), who see a complete definition of creative \nproducts as adding purpose and duration to the traditional novelty and value criteria. \nThe consequences for children\u2019s creativity and not only seem clear enough. The \n\u201cscribbling with crayon on paper of a monkey\u201d, the \u201crandom banging on a piano of an \ninfant\u201d and \u201cthe free-associational \u2018words-salads\u2019 of the schizophrenic\u201d are to be \ndisregarded by creativity researchers (Weisberg, 1993, p. 243). Reviewing some \ncritiques of the idea of children\u2019s imaginative capacities, Gardner (1982) enumerates: \nlack of control, of deliberate intention and of the ability to select among alternatives. In \nconclusion: \u201cfrom this point of view, children\u2019s apparently imaginative activities are \nbest written off as happy accidents\u201d (Gardner, 1982, p. 169).    \n  \nOnce again, on the surface, this association between intentionality and creativity \nseems legitimate but what it betrays is an implicit assumption that human beings are \nrational and goal-directed thinkers and creators. The myth of the \u2018Great Creator\u2019, \nembarked on a large-scale project to revolutionise science, art, and society, planning \nahead and being all-knowing of the details and implications of his actions doesn\u2019t \nactually pass the test of empirical evidence. As it turns out, creators are not fully aware \nat each and every moment of where their work is going and how it will turn out. The \ncreative process is defined by moments of unconscious incubation, by accidents and \ndiscoveries, by losing and finding one\u2019s way. Realising this is the case, authors like \nWeisberg are quick to add that accidental discoveries (like that of penicillin) are not \ncreative but can become so if and when \u201cthe individual realizes that the accident \ncould be plumbed further\u201d (Weisberg, 1993, p. 243). What at a macro-level and in \nretrospect seems like a planned and conscious journey, at a micro-level looks like a \ncontinuous cycle of micro-discoveries, of uncertainties and re-evaluations. This state of \naffairs has been superbly captured by John Dewey in his proposition of seeing the \n(artist\u2019s) creative work as a constant cycle of doings (acting on the world) and \nundergoings (taking in the reaction of the world). The creator does not create in a \nvacuum but in a physical and social environment and the creative process is \nintrinsically linked to this environment. Furthermore, instead of placing accidents at the \nperiphery of creative action we should consider them, as Dewey encourages us, at the \ncore of an authentic experience of being creative:      \n \n\u201cThe unexpected turn, something which the artist himself does not definitely \nforesee, is a condition of the felicitous quality of a work of art; it saves it from \n \n10\nbeing mechanical. It gives the spontaneity of the unpremeditated to what \nwould otherwise be a fruit of calculation. The painter and poet like the scientific \ninquirer know the delights of discovery. Those who carry on their work as a \ndemonstration of a preconceived thesis may have the joys of egotistic success \nbut not that of fulfilment of an experience for its own sake. In the latter they learn \nby their work, as they proceed, to see and feel what had not been part of their \noriginal plan and purpose\u201d (Dewey, 1934, pp. 144-145). \n  \nThere is mounting evidence today that the creative process is not taking place \u2018in the \nmind\u2019 of the person, according to her intentions and plans, but actually is being played \nout in interactions with a physical and social world. This conclusion is supported both by \ncreators and scientists. Paul Klee (1930) for example, discussing the process of painting, \nconcludes that the painter \u201cknows a great deal, but he only knows it afterwards\u201d (cited \nin Lynton, 1975, p. 49). From another standpoint, Bruner shrewdly remarks, \u201cthe road to \nbanality is paved with creative intentions\u201d (Bruner, 1962, p. 18). Adopting such a \nperspective on creativity, much more akin to a \u2018cultural\u2019 reading of it, encourages us to \nbring back to the table the notion of children\u2019s creativity. Children, especially at lower \nages, don\u2019t plan and don\u2019t intend very much. But at the same time, whatever they \n\u2018create\u2019 (a drawing, a form, a story, etc.), they are very eager to infuse with meaning \nand different interpretations. The same drawing becomes the basis for multiple stories, \nthe same construction the starting point of different games. The \u2018happy accidents\u2019 \nreferred to earlier are indeed happy, prompting meaning-creation further and further.    \n  \n3.3. The person perspective  \n \nCreativity as a strictly personal (or intrapersonal) affair has been criticised above, and \nyet what centuries of thinking about \u2018creation\u2019 and decades of creativity research \nhave shown us is precisely the fact that creativity was (and still is to a large extent) \nconsidered an individual attribute. The person of the genius is responsible for \u2018creating\u2019 \nand, more recently, the personality or cognition of the individual are seen as the locus \nof creativity (Gl\u0103veanu, 2010a). When applied to children, the person definition is \nbound to run into a serious problem. As argued in section 1, children have by and large \nbeen historically considered not as \u2018real\u2019 but as future persons, as \u2018becoming\u2019 persons. \nAs such, the personality or cognitive structures of the child are in permanent \nconstruction and transformation so how can we legitimately talk about a child\u2019s stable \ncreative traits? Nonetheless, some authors can and do. For example Dudek (1973, p. 6), \nwas confident to argue that \u201cwhat we call creativity in children would seem to fall \nunder the definition of creativity as personality trait\u201d. This attitude or trait was not called \ncreativity (unsurprisingly given the controversy presented here) but expressiveness, a \nprecursor of later creative achievement. Expressiveness stands for characteristics such \n \n11\nas spontaneity, openness, outgoingness and aliveness. It was of course noted that this \nquality of the child is not really stable, at least below the age of five (p. 15).      \n \nWhat is it, again, that makes authors so reluctant to talk directly about the creativity of \nchildren? The person perspective adds to the process one in this regard. The lack of full \nself and others-awareness is pointed to when disregarding children\u2019s expressive efforts. \nChildren, it is considered, rarely reflect on themselves and little less on whether they are \ncreative or artistic (Engel, 1993). How could they? And even when it\u2019s granted to them \nthe awareness of doing things differently than others, a lack of appreciation for what \nrules and conventions are is lamented (Gardner, 1982, p. 89). Related to this point, \nchildren as a person \u2018in becoming\u2019 lack a real knowledge base to support their \n\u2018creativity\u2019. Several authors have noticed in the work of great creators \u201can extensive \namount of time between their initial exposure to the field and production of their first \nsignificant work\u201d (Weisberg, 1999, p. 227). This has been formalised by Gardner (1993) \nas the \u201c10-year rule\u201d. Applying this logic to children would mean that, if seriously \nstarting to engage with a domain at the age of two, chances are that only after 12 \nyears of age a remarkable contribution would be made... Fortunately or unfortunately \nthough, children are much less focused and determined than this, having to learn \nabout the world in general, and not some obscure segment of it. The \u2018Great Creation\u2019 \nparadigm, in action, limits again the meaning of what constitutes creative work.  \n \nIn the end, the scientific community is gradually becoming disenchanted with the \nperspective of locating creativity in the person, in her personality traits or cognitive \nmechanisms. There are plenty of reasons for this. To begin with, measures of personality \nor cognition (like divergent thinking) did not demonstrate high predictive validity. This is \nmost obvious in the case of children, whose creative \u2018potential\u2019 is constantly scrutinised \nwith the hope of determining who will be the creators of tomorrow. However, measures \nof \u2018expressiveness\u2019, for example, are not predictive of future performance (Dudek, \n1973, p. 15). At a deeper level though, this dissatisfaction with intrapersonal \nexplanations of creativity came as a result of acknowledging that creating is not an \nindividual affair, but involves the individual in relation to society and culture. This aspect \nstarts to be reflected in the \u2018press\u2019 factor discussed below.    \n \n3.4. The press (social) perspective  \n \nBefore putting children\u2019s creativity to the \u2018test\u2019 of this last factor, it is important to make \na general note about it. For emphasising social influences on creativity, the \u2018press\u2019 \nfactor might seem at the beginning quite in tone with a \u2018cultural\u2019 reading of creativity. \nThis is and is not so because, beyond stating that the social and cultural matter when \nwe talk about creativity, \u2018cultural\u2019 approaches also have a special way of \nunderstanding the social and the cultural. Mainstream psychology (including social, \n \n12\ndevelopmental and creativity psychology) have often considered the social as an \noutside factor, influencing the thinking and behaviour of the individual, putting certain \n\u2018pressures\u2019 (hence press) on them and directing them. Cultural psychology makes a \npoint in considering society and culture as working from \u2018within\u2019 and not (only) from the \n\u2018outside\u2019 of socialised individuals. Institutions and social structures exist on the \u2018outside\u2019, \nbut the symbolic world they populate can only be developed \u2018in\u2019 and especially \u2018in \nbetween\u2019 persons. The relevance of this observation will become obvious as follows. \n \nAre children creative in relation to the social and the cultural world? They certainly \nbelong to this world and make constant efforts to apprehend it and become part of it. \nThese efforts, defining the developmental process, are in fact revealing the \u2018creativity\u2019 \nof adjusting to an outside space which is at times comfortable and familiar, at times \nscary and dangerous, but most of all overwhelming in its demanding complexity. And \nyet, many would argue that it is precisely because children don\u2019t have anything to \ncontribute to this \u2018space\u2019, that they cannot and should not be called creative. \nCsikszentmihalyi\u2019s (1988) model of person \u2013 field \u2013 domain illustrates this point:   \n \n\u201cThis is an epistemological issue; in my view, it is society that constitutes creativity; \ntherefore you can\u2019t say that a child has any creativity to be suppressed until a \ncertain segment of society \u2013 the field \u2013 construes it as such. I don\u2019t know what it \nmeans to say that children are creative or that they display creativity. Usually what \npeople mean by these terms is that children often appear to adults to be original, \nimaginative, or nonconforming. One could just as well interpret such behavior as \nignorance of rules, or inability to follow them. There is really no evidence that this \nrelates to adult creativity, as we usually think of it \u2013 that is, as an original response \nthat is socially valued and brought to fruition\u201d (Csikszentmihalyi in Sawyer et al., \n2003, p. 220). \n \nOther authors agree with this position. Feldman remarks for example that it is true that \n\u201cno child has ever added to a culturally valued body of knowledge\u201d (in Sawyer et al., \n2003, p. 219). The issue of (social and cultural) value, touched upon in section 3.1., \ngains its true proportion when we consider it in light of social mechanisms. Consistent \nwith his epistemology, Csikszentmihalyi is ready nevertheless to acknowledge the fact \nthat children\u2019s productions can be \u2018valuable\u2019 indeed for parents and teachers, but for \nas long as there is no constituted domain and field for them, they remain \u201cperipheral to \nevery culture\u201d and, as such, \u201cthe creativity of such productions is not very relevant\u201d \n(Csikszentmihalyi in Sawyer et al., 2003, p. 220). \n \nThis particular vision brings us right back to the first observation regarding the two \nunderstandings of culture. On the one hand we have a structural, institutional, and \nhighly formalised version of culture, adopted by Csikszentmihalyi and others. On the \n \n13\nother hand though, we can hold a vision of culture as a micro and macro \nphenomenon, dynamic and open to the \u2018small creations\u2019 that keep it alive and give it \ncontinuity. Culture as a set of symbolic and material artefacts, of norms and \nconventions, of types of knowledge and behaviours, doesn\u2019t need to be embodied in \na recognised field or domain to exist as such (see Gl\u0103veanu, 2010b; Willis, 1990). Culture \nexists and is produced between people as well, in families, in schools, on the streets, \netc. Contributing to these (micro) cultures is no less significant than contributing to \ninstitutionalised domains such as the arts or sciences. Without all these contributions we \nwould not be able to speak of culture or society. Great Creations are remarkable, but \nsmall, mundane ones, are very much significant in their own right. And it is this kind of \nsignificance that children\u2019s \u2018creative\u2019 activity gains and generates. As Engel (1993) \nrightfully observes, the classroom context for example is a cultural system in itself, no less \ncomparable to artists\u2019 studios, scientists\u2019 laboratories or inventors\u2019 testing rooms.         \n \n4. A practical \u2018bet\u2019 and its implications  \n \nOur analysis of arguments for and against the idea of children\u2019s creativity has revealed \nthus far a very complex picture. Indeed, there is no single uncontested criterion that \ncan help us to delineate radically the creative from the uncreative. What is more, each \ncriterion discussed above (originality, value, intentionality, etc.) is deeply and intricately \nconnected to our general conceptions about children and creativity as such. In order \nto simplify things \u2013 although in this regard simplifications can be misleading \u2013 we can \ncome to abstract two general directions in how we conceptualise children on the one \nhand, and creativity on the other. By and large, children are either depicted in our \ntheories as passive and receptive, depending on the outside world and simply \u2018taking \nin\u2019 the influence of their environment, or as active and interactive, responding from an \nearly age to the world around them and developing through interactions with others, \nwhere both child and other shape the course of the interaction. In the case of \ncreativity the claim has been made for a distinction between romantic or \u2018genius\u2019 \nreadings of the phenomenon, based on the image of the Great Creator and the \nrevolutionary creation, and cultural and social readings, trying to bridge great creative \nachievements with the everyday productions of \u2018ordinary\u2019 people. In this simplified \nlandscape, it becomes clear that persons (including scientists) who believe in the idea \nof a passive child and hold a genius vision of creativity, will most likely answer the \nquestion \u2018are children creative?\u2019 in a negative way. On the contrary, an active child \nand a cultural perspective on creativity may support a positive answer to the same \nquestion. Of course there are many more positions \u2018in between\u2019 and some people may \nagree with some arguments and not others. While my personal views incline towards \nthe second type of answer, this article was not meant to be an exercise in discovering \nthe \u2018truth\u2019 about children and creativity. Written from a constructionist perspective, the \nassumption I started with is that different readings or stories we tell about people, \n \n14\nobjects and processes of the world, need to be understood in their own right. Neither \none, in this case, is more \u2018correct\u2019 than the other simply because (and this has been \nthe central piece of the argument) they are drawing from different interpretative \nframeworks. To simplify even further, if possible, they serve as two differently coloured \npairs of glasses, and when using one we get to see the same object differently from \nwhen we use the other. \n \nHaving said that, constructionism is not meant to be an \u2018everything goes\u2019 type of \nepistemology. Although different constructions of the world are possible, it doesn\u2019t \nmean all are equally useful for acting in the world. With the risk of turning to pragmatism \nright towards the end, I will propose looking at children\u2019s creativity in a way similar to \nPascal\u2019s wager about the existence of God (see 2008 edition). In a nutshell, his \nargument was that believing in the existence of God is bound to bring many \nadvantages if the belief turns out to be correct while still being advantageous even \nwhen proven wrong. The alternative belief is detrimental in both cases. Applying this to \nour particular question, it can be phrased as: adopting a position favourable to seeing \nthe child as active and creativity as incorporating \u2018ordinary\u2019 and \u2018extraordinary\u2019 \naccomplishments turns out to have many more theoretical and practical benefits than \nthe alternative. Let us briefly elaborate on these in three domains: child psychology, the \npsychology of creativity, and education.  \n \nChild psychologists starting with the premise that children are indeed creative from an \nearly age, in their own ways, supported by social interaction and using the means they \nhave at their disposal, would probably focus more on how novelty is produced and the \nrole it plays in the development of the child (see also Feldman, 1999, on creativity and \ndevelopmental shifts). They would recognise the efforts made by children, from early \non, to engage with the world around them, to adjust to it while at the same time trying \nto make it a more hospitable and secure place. Cultivating a vision where children\u2019s \nagency is implied would make us look more carefully at moments of micro-interaction \nbetween children and their peers, families, teachers, etc. and how they are driven by \nthe active and creative involvement of both parties. This particular line of research is \nstarting to be explored more and more by authors who focus on the bidirectionality of \nparent-child relations (Lawrence and Valsiner, 2003; Kuczynski and Navara, 2006), on \nelaborating a dynamic theory of socialisation (Maccoby, 1992; Kuczynski and Parkin, \n2007), and an interpretative approach to development (Corsaro and Eder, 1990). All \nthese elaborations are fundamentally challenging the notion of the child as passively \nmodelled by parents and broader social systems. On the contrary, children \u201cbuild in \ninnovative ways on the structure of the culturally organized information that they \nexperience in interaction with others and in their exploration of the man-made physical \nenvironment\u201d (Valsiner, 1997, p. 176). A developmental psychology founded on this \nkind of ethos would bring the \u2018creative\u2019 expressions of the child to the forefront, \n \n15\nstudying them in the context of the life and experience of their \u2018author\u2019 and less by \ncomparison to those of the adult. Children\u2019s meanings associated with their creations \nwould be valued, reducing the risk of adultcentric and restrictive interpretations. \n \nFor creativity theory and research, accepting the existence of children\u2019s creativity \nwould have even more radical consequences, some of which have been captured in \nthe sections above. Genius readings of creativity have been all too dominant in past \nand present literature on the topic, obscuring the fact that \u2018creative\u2019 expression should \nnot be restricted to an individual or small group of individuals but be reconnected to \nthe life of human communities. As Bateson (1999, p. 153) notes, denying everyday life \ncreativity \u201cdeprives us of a range of models for the creative process\u201d. The present \narticle exposed some of the potentially beneficial consequences of reading creativity \nthrough cultural \u2018lenses\u2019: a more fluid process and performance based approach, a \ngrounding of creative action in the social and material world, a recasting of culture as \nan emergent phenomenon. This would also encourage researchers to understand the \nmechanisms of \u2018little c creativity\u2019, a notion discussed by Anna Craft extensively in her \nwork. As an attitude to life revolving around the \u201cresourcefulness and agency of \nordinary people\u201d (Craft, 2001, p. 49), little c creativity is an expression of \u2018possibility \nthinking\u2019, in its turn founded on imagination, curiosity and play (Craft, 2002). But above \nall, what children\u2019s creativity would mean for creativity research is operating with a \nbroader, more comprehensive definition of creativity. \u2018Ordinary\u2019 creativity can and \ndoes have \u2018extraordinary\u2019 effects, and among them is the maintenance and constant \nre-generation of human culture. Furthermore, what this \u2018extended definition\u2019 does in \nthe end is to reveal the false dichotomy between \u2018higher\u2019 and \u2018lower\u2019 forms of \ncreativity. These are not separated by a \u2018gap\u2019, and neither placed on a \u2018continuum\u2019, \nbut the \u2018higher\u2019 is built upon the \u2018lower\u2019, without which it would not exist. Celebrated \nforms of creativity are spurring from the fertile ground of everyday, playful creation. It is \nwhat Wegerif (2010, p. 38) also hinted at when considering that: \n \n\u201c(...) it is not possible to get creativity 2, socially valued products, without first \nhaving lots of creativity 1, the everyday creativity of playfully coming up with lots \nof new and different ideas, connections and ways of seeing things regardless of \nwhether or not these are socially valuable\u201d.  \n \nFinally, when it comes to educational practices, it is quite obvious why recognising \nchildren\u2019s creativity is better than the alternative: it manages to put it on the agenda of \neducators and encourages them to consider creative expression and foster all those \nbehaviours and attitudes linked to it (Craft, 2005). Creativity has come to be \nconsidered one of the most valuable attributes a person could have, at least in today\u2019s \nWestern societies, if not at a global level (Manson, 2003), and this certainly lead to the \nuniversalisation of creativity in the contemporary world of education (Jeffrey and Craft, \n \n16\n2001). Thinking about ways in which this quality can be cultivated in children is bound \nto bring together (as it does) parents, teachers and scientists from a variety of \ndisciplines. Believing in the existence of creativity in children will further help \n\u2018materialise\u2019 it, by paying more attention to all instances with potential creative value. \nCsikszentmihalyi argued, as we have seen from above, that a domain such as \n\u2018children\u2019s art\u2019 is peripheral to our culture and so children\u2019s creativity is a contradiction \nin terms. This positions us inside a vicious cycle where not legitimising creativity leads to \nnot encouraging or even discovering it, which in turn explains the absence of more \ninstitutionalised forums to be concerned with it, and finally reinforces the attitude of \nignoring it even as a possibility. It is plausible that, if more people consider children to \nbe creative, there will be stronger societal level transformations to allow for the display \nand celebration of this form of creativity. However, encouraging creativity in \neducational settings is not without its own problems and dilemmas, both practical and \ntheoretical, psychological and pedagogical. Craft (2005) highlighted several of these, \nfrom the assumption that creativity is universal in nature and always a \u2018good thing\u2019 in \nthe classroom, to the more pragmatic relationship between knowledge, the curriculum \nand creativity. These are all issues that require deep consideration and creative \nthinking on the part of theorists and practitioners alike.   \n \n5. Concluding thoughts   \n \nThis article has addressed the issue of children\u2019s creativity and argued for considering \nchildren as active and creative beings, developing forms of creative expression in \ninteraction with adults and through play and experimentation with cultural artefacts. \nThe interrogation about children\u2019s creativity is far from meaningless. In fact, Vygotsky \nhimself stated that \u201cone of the most important questions of child psychology and \npedagogy is the question about creativity in children, its development and its \nsignificance for the general development of the child\u201d (Vygotsky, 1930\/1967, cited in \nSmolucha, 1992, p. 51). And yet, despite its importance, we know little about the \nformative conditions of creativity in children (Feldhusen, 2002, p. 182). This is arguably \nthe result not only of the intricacy of the phenomenon (which, on its own, could very \nwell explain the slow progress) but, importantly, also of our general conceptions about \nchildren and about creativity. Opting for an understanding of children as creative \nwould potentially transform our theories about children and creativity, and also \ninfluence our educational practices. In itself though, this would be only the beginning \nfor a new set of questions and research interests. At least two of great importance are: \nresearch methodologies for studying children\u2019s creativity and the domain specificity or \ngenerality of children\u2019s creative expression. Both areas are not \u2018new\u2019 in any way, yet \nmuch of the work done in these fields reflects some problematic assumptions. For \nexample, testing children\u2019s creativity often starts from the premise that creativity is an \nintrapersonal feature or that creative products can be rated by experts who have little \n \n17\naccess to process-information. Also, when it comes to creativity and domains, \nadopting a cultural perspective would support specificity with more arguments such as \nthe \u2018local\u2019 embededness of creative action and the dependence of the symbolic \nfunction on available systems of tools and signs. All these insights and many more \nwould be lost though unless we become ready to entertain the idea that children and \ncreativity form not only a likely but also a promising pair.    \n \nAcknowledgments: This work was supported by the Economic and Social Research \nCouncil [grant 620 number ES\/H\/13199\/1].
