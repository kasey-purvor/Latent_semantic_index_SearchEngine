His publications on episcopacy provide an insight into the motivations and beliefs of a prominent\nepiscopal reformer and into the ecclesiastical culture of seventeenth-century France. This article seeks to\ndemonstrate that Camus\u2019 episcopal ideal was a coherent adaptation of traditional and contemporary views\nproduced in response to post-Trent circumstances and that the bishop\u2019s published views had a significant\nimpact upon his fellow prelates and their relationship with the papacy.\nI\nJ ean-Pierre Camus\u2019 lengthy episcopal career (1609\u201352) coincided with thedecisive decades of Catholic renewal in early modern France, years of\nmajor development within the Church in regard to reform of the higher\nand lower clergy and the standardisation of religious life amongst the faithful.\nThe basis of that reform was the Council of Trent which, between 1545 and\n1563, provided a programme which shaped ecclesiastical practice within the\nCatholic Church for several centuries. Its most obvious innovation was to\ndevise an organisational strategy, based upon the office of bishop, which was\ndesigned to restore religious and moral discipline to the clergy and laity and\nperhaps regain some of the souls lost to Protestantism. The council\u2019s entire\nprogramme of institutional reform was built upon the episcopal office, and\ncalled upon bishops to discipline their clergy through synods and visitations,\nto preach regularly and, of course, to reside permanently within their\ndioceses.1 In the decades following the council, many bishops throughout\n1 Canons and decrees of the Council of Trent, ed.

Equally, his ex-\nperience provides a window onto the structural and organisational difficulties\nwhich plagued the emerging Tridentine Church in France.\nCamus was representative of many Tridentine bishops who, while wel-\ncoming the council\u2019s decrees, regarded them as inadequate for the practical\nrequirements of bishops. Many of them came to realise that the Council of\nTrent did not offer a comprehensive treatment of episcopacy in all its facets\nbut concentrated principally upon the administrative responsibilities of prel-\nates. The council presented the role of the bishop in overwhelmingly\nlegalistic and jurisdictional terms, a product of Trent\u2019s emphasis upon\nimplementing an efficient ecclesiastical governmental structure. By contrast,\nit presented only the bare bones of an episcopal theology to support the\ncomprehensively listed duties of government and discipline. Administration\nwas just one aspect of episcopacy, if a crucial one, and post-Tridentine\nbishops both in and out of France were well aware of this fact. It was for this\nreason that a number of works on the officium episcopi were published during\nthe late sixteenth century, envisaged as guidebooks for bishops on the spiri-\ntual and practical aspects of their office. The driving forces behind works on\nepiscopacy during this period were, not surprisingly, prelates themselves.\nA number of them produced texts based upon their own practical ex-\nperiences and reflections and attempted to provide an episcopal spirituality\nto inspire and supplement administrative action.3\nAs a general council, Trent would seem to have been the ideal occasion for\na theology of episcopacy to be officially defined, particularly since the\ncouncil\u2019s decrees concentrated so much on the notion of episcopal govern-\nment. There were very obvious reasons, however, why the council failed to\nprovide a full theology, with the result that, by Camus\u2019 time, debate over the\nnature and function of episcopacy remained a divisive issue. This was be-\ncause reflection did not just focus upon episcopal spirituality but also upon\nthe potentially more explosive issues of hierarchy and jurisdiction. Trent\navoided the thorny questions by deliberately failing to address the prob-\nlematic issue of the nature of episcopal jurisdiction when the topic arose\nduring the debates on episcopal residence and the sacrament of order. In\nfact, in debating whether a bishop held his jurisdiction directly from God\n(de iure divino) or indirectly via the pope, the council very nearly collapsed in\n2 Joseph Bergin, \u2018The Counter-Reformation and its bishops \u2019, Past and Present clxv (1999),\n30\u201373.\n3 Hubert Jedin, L\u2019Eve\u02c6que dans la tradition pastorale du xvie sie`cle, trans. Paul Broutin, Bruges\n1953, 85\u2013114.\nB I SHOPS IN TR IDENT INE FRANCE : J EAN-P I ERRE CAMUS 255\ndisarray and was only able to avoid this by deliberately omitting any\nreference whatsoever to the issue. To confirm that episcopal jurisdiction was\nheld immediately from God severely limited papal jurisdiction over bishops\nand within dioceses, because it denied the pope\u2019s right to intervene in a\nbishop\u2019s exercise of his diocesan jurisdiction. It was for this reason that the\npapacy, represented by its legates and zelanti bishops, so categorically resisted\nall pressure on this doctrine, fearing that it would weaken papal authority\nwithin the Church and perhaps even open the door to conciliarism once\nmore.4\nSimilar suspicions characterised the debates over sacramental order. The\ncouncil decreed finally that bishops were distinct from and superior to priests\nas a result of their authority to govern as successors of the Apostles and as a\nresult of their ability to confer the sacraments of ordination and confir-\nmation.5 Here, the council plumped for the dominant, though previously\nunofficial, scholastic distinction between episcopal order (bishops\u2019 power to\nconfer order and to confirm) and jurisdiction (their power to govern) and\nconfirmed that the prelate could be distinguished from the priest by his\npower of order and his greater jurisdiction. Yet the failure to discuss the the-\nology of this distinction meant that an area of episcopacy which had long\nbeen a source of theological and canonical reflection remained unresolved.\nOnce again, the council confirmed the jurisdictional powers of bishops\nbut deliberately refrained from responding to the logical questions : first, did\nthis jurisdiction come directly from God or indirectly via the pope, and\nsecond, precisely what degree of independent jurisdiction could a bishop\nexpect to possess within his diocese?\nSignificantly, since Trent\u2019s final decrees on episcopal residence and the\nsacrament of order made no reference to the issue of jurisdictional ius divinum,\nit remained open to future interpretation. Certainly it was a charged subject,\nwith potentially crucial consequences for the jurisdictional authority of\nbishops and the pope and for the status of bishops vis-a`-vis the papacy and\nlower clergy. This was an issue which would become particularly pertinent\nin the context of ecclesiastical reform, most glaringly in the relationship\nbetween bishops and the religious orders. Members of the regular orders,\nmost obviously the Jesuits, but also the Capuchins, Franciscans and others,\nhad been to the fore of Catholic reform, in France and elsewhere, even\nbefore Trent, and their initiatives had won them considerable indepen-\ndence of bishops within dioceses. Trent\u2019s decrees were thus, in part, a\nreaction to this development ; it favoured parochial pastoral care under\n4 Alain Tallon, La France et le Concile de Trente (1518\u20131563), Rome 1997, 770\u201384; Hubert\nJedin, Crisis and closure of the Council of Trent 1562\u20131563, London 1967.\n5 Canons and decrees, sess.

In practice, regulars frequently refused to accept this\nline and, in their defence, cited papal privileges which allowed them to admin-\nister sacraments and to preach without episcopal leave because they acted as\npapal delegates. When they did so, they clashed heavily with reforming\nbishops determined to wield the governmental power which they believed\nthat Trent confirmed as belonging to their office. This was certainly the case\nin Tridentine France where many bishops struggled to bring independently-\nminded regulars under their effective jurisdiction. As a result, disputes fre-\nquently exploded in dioceses, often catapulting protagonists onto the national\nstage through pamphlet wars and via the Assembly of Clergy which usually\nbecame directly involved in specific quarrels when bishops appealed to it\nfor support.11 The regulars\u2019 episcopal critics argued that they prejudiced\ndiocesan discipline, caused rivalry between secular and regular clergy and\nultimately hindered the progress of reform. But these sustained and frequent\nstruggles for control of religious practices within dioceses meant that it was by\nno means a foregone conclusion that the bishops would succeed in stamping\ntheir authority upon diocesan ecclesiastical structures and personnel. The\nissues at stake were fundamental to the future shape of the Church and to the\npower of bishops within it. It is for this reason that quarrels assumed broad\nimportance for bishops and regulars ; they were never simply petty squabbles\nover, for instance, the simultaneous celebration of masses in regular and\n6 Canons and decrees, sess.

Rather, they were quarrels which encapsulated\nthe much larger dilemma of the loci of power within the Church.\nA persistent tradition of Gallican independence made French bishops\nespecially sensitive to these questions of ecclesiastical jurisdiction. In the early\nfifteenth century, France had been a hotbed of the conciliarist doctrine which\nhad been given its most famous exposition in the decrees of the Council of\nConstance in whose drafting Jean Gerson, the chancellor of the University of\nParis, had played so major a role.12 By the sixteenth century, ecclesiastical\nGallicanism had also become associated with the loosely-defined \u2018 liberties \u2019 of\nthe French Church, which claimed to fix the boundaries of papal jurisdiction\nin France.13 Yet Gallicanism was at least as much an attitude as a codified set\nof laws, and represented a spirit of independence which resented papal inter-\nvention in French ecclesiastical affairs. In addition to favouring conciliarism,\nit was, more generally, opposed to unrestricted papal monarchy in day-\nto-day ecclesiastical government and granted bishops considerable indepen-\ndence of action within dioceses. Within the French episcopate, Gallicanism\nhad long passed its medieval heyday by the early 1600s, and a vocal party\nof ultramontanes, led by Cardinal Du Perron and Cardinal La Roche-\nfoucauld, then dominated its affairs. Yet, rather than being a spent force,\nthe tradition lay dormant and simply required specific catalysts to return\nto its former strength. Amongst those catalysts in the seventeenth century\nwould be the catalogue of disputes involving the triangle of bishops, regulars\nand the papacy: there was a natural correspondence between the bishops\u2019\ndefence of their jurisdiction over the regular orders and the traditional\ndoctrine of Gallicanism which rejected papal autocracy and accorded the\nepiscopate an active role in conciliar government. Over the course of the\ncentury, the episcopate increasingly linked its position with Gallican prin-\nciples of ecclesiastical independence, a pattern which the legacy of suspicion\nleft by each individual dispute would exacerbate. These quarrels were, there-\nfore, crucial to the shifting structure of relations between, not only bishops\nand regulars, but also between the episcopate and the papacy.\n12 Held in 1414, the Council of Constance declared that general councils held their\nauthority directly from Christ and that everyone, including the pope, was bound to obey their\ndecrees. This decision was subsequently overturned by a papal bull of 1460 which condemned\nappeals to councils against papal decisions and, for good measure, by the Councils of Florence\n(1437) and the Lateran (1512), though conciliarists continued to deny the legitimacy of their\ndecrees : Decrees of the ecumenical councils, i. 409\u201310, 532\u20134, 595\u20136; Aime\u00b4-Georges Martimort,\nLe Gallicanisme de Bossuet, Paris 1953, 47 ; Walter Ullmann, Medieval political thought,\nHarmondsworth 1975, 219\u201322.

Catherine Brown, Pastor and laity in the\ntheology of Jean Gerson, Cambridge 1987.\n13 The standard works on Gallicanism are Victor Martin, Le Gallicanisme et la re\u00b4forme\ncatholique, Paris 1919, and Le Gallicanisme politique et le clerge\u00b4 de France, Paris 1929. See also his\nLes Origines du gallicanisme, Paris 1939, for the medieval background to seventeenth-century\ndisputes.\n258 AL I SON FORRESTAL\nII\nThe French Church was rather late to the drive for ecclesiastical reform, due\nmainly to the fact that the country was virtually crippled by religious war\nduring the late sixteenth century. Yet the early decades of the seventeenth\ncentury saw a concerted effort by the episcopate to bring religious order to\ndioceses. Reform-minded individuals resided in their dioceses and began to\norganise them along Tridentine lines by introducing regular synods and\nvisitations. Simultaneously, the crown, under the influence of reformers like\nVincent de Paul, increasingly appointed bishops who were in orders, the-\nologically educated and experienced in diocesan administration.14 Jean-Pierre\nCamus was one of this new breed of reforming bishops, and was appointed to\nBelley in south-east France in 1609. From a wealthy robe background, he was\nhighly and broadly educated, and undertook intensive theological studies\nprior to his ordination around 1608.15 A bishop of the de\u00b4vot stamp, he became\na close confidant of both Franc\u00b8ois de Sales, bishop of Geneva, and Pierre de\nBe\u00b4rulle, founder of the French Oratorians and the French spiritual leader\nof the early seventeenth century. Indeed, these reformers acted as decisive,\nthough not exclusive, influences upon his theological outlook and ecclesi-\nastical career. Camus was a prolific writer, publishing 250 works during his life\n(1584\u20131652), comprising treatises, discourses, homilies, manuals of instruction\nand devotional texts. He continued to publish even after his resignation from\nBelley in 1629, a decision made in the wake of much soul-searching. This\nproduced the rather ironic situation of a bishop without a bishopric, who\nargued consistently for episcopally-led reform within dioceses, although in\nno position to carry it out himself. But even though he was never to hold a\ndiocese again, Camus, having been consecrated, retained his episcopal status,\nand this motivated him to continue his work of reform through publication\nand instruction. Because he was still a member of the episcopate, he remained\njust as keen to continue refining his views of episcopacy and ecclesiastical\nhierarchy, and because his time was not absorbed in diocesan administration,\nhe was able to devote extended periods to championing the episcopal office\nthrough his publications. His writings upon episcopacy were, almost without\nexception, produced in this later period.\nThese texts, published between 1615 and 1642, assumed several forms. The\nHome\u00b4lies des e\u00b4tats ge\u00b4ne\u00b4raux and the Homelies panegyriques de Sainct Charles Borromee16\n14 Joseph Bergin, The making of the French episcopate, 1589\u20131661, New Haven\u2013London 1996,\n416\u2013541 ; Rene\u00b4 Taveneaux, Le Catholicisme dans la France classique 1610\u20131715, Paris 1980.\n15 Henri Bre\u00b4mond, Histoire litte\u00b4raire du sentiment religieux en France, Paris 1935\u20136, i. 154\u20135;\nClaude Michaud, L\u2019 E\u00b4glise et l\u2019argent sous l\u2019ancien re\u00b4gime : les receveurs ge\u00b4ne\u00b4raux du clerge\u00b4 de France aux\nxvie\u2013xviie sie`cles, Paris 1991, 405\u20138.\n16 Jean-Pierre Camus, Home\u00b4lies des e\u00b4tats ge\u00b4ne\u00b4raux (1614\u201315), ed.

In\nfact, the homilies on Borromeo contain eight lengthy sermons on the former\narchbishop of Milan, all heard by large congregations in Parisian churches\nbetween 1616 and 1622. Camus\u2019 reputation as an orator ensured that his\npreaching always attracted crowds, but it is perhaps more difficult to assess\nthe levels of circulation and readership which his writings on episcopacy and\nhierarchy enjoyed once they were published. None of the texts went through\nmore than one edition, though the multi-volume L\u2019Esprit du bien-heureux\nFranc\u00b8ois de Sales, first published in 1639, was reprinted several times after 1700\nand became the standard reference source for Salesian spirituality.17 Equally,\nthe manuals for bishops written by French clergy during the seventeenth\ncentury do not direct bishops to Camus\u2019 publications. The works they did\nrecommend as inspirations for bishops\u2019 daily sessions of prayer and study\ntended to be hagiographic Lives of saints or primary sources of guidance, such\nas the decrees of Trent and the Gospels, rather than commentaries which\nfiltered the ideas contained in such texts.18 This was also the case with the\nreading recommended by the conferences attended by five south-western\nbishops in 1649 and 1656, under the presidency of Alain de Solminihac, the\nreforming bishop of Cahors.19 Some of Camus\u2019 publications were un-\ndoubtedly too combative or thematically focused to be suitable daily reading,\nbut he did produce a manual of instruction for bishops, Les Fonctions du hier-\narque parfaict, which discussed the key spiritual and theological aspects of the\nepiscopal office such as its origins, pastoral duties and virtues, and it was\npublished seven years before the five bishops first met in Mercue`s.20 This\nwas the first text of this type to be published in French and by a Frenchman\nin the seventeenth century and it might be expected that it would have\nbeen commended by the conferences.\nThe fact that the bishops who attended the Mercue`s conferences did not\nrecommend Camus\u2019 manual suggests that they were not familiar with it or\ndid not consider it to be suitable. But, if Camus\u2019 Hierarque parfaict may not\nhave been well-known within the episcopate by the mid-century, the same is\ncertainly not true of several of his other publications on episcopacy. These\n17 Idem, L\u2019Esprit du bien-heureux Franc\u00b8ois de Sales, evesque de Geneve, Paris 1840.\n18 For example, Rene Le Mee\u2019s Le Prelat accomply, represente\u00b4 en la personne d\u2019illustrissime seigneur\nPhilippe Cospean, evesque et comte de Lisieux, Saumur 1647, 129.

By the 1630s all that was required was a high-\nprofile case to produce a quarrel on the international ecclesiastical stage once\nmore.\nAlready a well-known author and reformer by 1630, Camus published\nfrom this date a series of related works which, in trenchant terms, confirmed\nthe subordination of regulars to bishops\u2019 authority within dioceses. These\naroused such a furore that the crown was forced to intervene through bishops\nlike Henri de Sourdis of Bordeaux as well as through Richelieu himself in\nefforts to restore equilibrium to the French Church.24 Rome proved equally\nconcerned with the threat posed by this dispute and tended to blame Camus\nfor inciting it : Nuncio Bichi accused Camus of excessive sarcasm and im-\nprudence, but warned against imprisoning him, placing him under guard or\nforcing him to leave France since this would simply further incite the epis-\ncopate\u2019s fury.25 This was certainly true and highlights the impact of the\nCamus case upon French bishops : papal efforts to silence Camus during the\n1630s merely distanced the episcopate from Rome and encouraged it to use\nthis case to defend the dignity of the episcopal office. Certainly, Camus\u2019\nfellow-bishops, having appointed their own assessors to examine and report\nto them on his publications, were well aware of the arguments adopted by\n21 Idem, De la Primaute\u00b4 et principaute\u00b4 de saint Pierre, et de ses successeurs : traite chronographique, Paris\n1630 (there are three copies of this in the BN); De l\u2019Unite [sic] de la hierarchie, Douai 1634;\nConsiderations hierarchiques, Paris 1642. The ideas on hierarchy and authority in these volumes\nwere reproduced succinctly in other publications by Camus, but they approached the\nquestions of hierarchy and authority from the basis of the religious vocation, analysing\nparticular features of it such as the value of vows and cloistered life, rather than from the\nepiscopal. For this reason, this article concentrates on those texts in which the primary themes\nare the merits and powers of the episcopal vocation.\n22 Forrestal, \u2018Fathers, pastors, kings \u2019, 124\u20138.\n23 Collection des proce`s-verbaux des assemble\u00b4es ge\u00b4ne\u00b4rales du clerge\u00b4 de France, ed.

In the first place, they\nconsidered the attacks upon him and upon his publications by Rome and the\nregulars unwarranted because his ideas were thoroughly orthodox. Secondly,\nhe was a fellow bishop and these attacks besmirched the honour of the office\nwhich he shared with other prelates. Both these factors ensured that the\nepiscopate strongly opposed any censure of Camus by Rome and contributed\nto the progressive cooling of relations between the papacy and the French\nepiscopate during the 1630s. This quarrel also motivated the Assembly of\nClergy, dominated by bishops, to revive the 1625 De\u00b4claration sur les re\u00b4guliers in\nthe hope of pushing Rome towards approval of its rules. While this was not\nsuccessful, Camus was not ultimately condemned by the papacy, so the epis-\ncopate scored some success against the papacy and the regular orders in this\nrespect. But, undoubtedly, this clash hardened the attitude of French bishops\nand helped to convince them that episcopal authority and dignity must be\nprotected from all attacks. This would become even clearer over the course of\nsubsequent decades when future quarrels erupted between the episcopate,\nregulars and the papacy.27\nCamus, then, was not only a significant literary figure, as is well-known,\nand as is testified by the quantity of his publications; his writings had sub-\nstantial influence upon the relationship between French bishops, the papacy\nand regulars during the 1630s and his ideas were regarded by prelates as\naccording with their own views. His texts offer crucial insights into the re-\nligious culture of early modern France and, more specifically, into the devel-\nopment of French episcopal ideology during the first half of the seventeenth\ncentury. Until now, little or no attention has been paid to Camus\u2019 publi-\ncations on episcopacy.28 Yet, it is in these that the forthright Camus reveals\nmuch about his own perception of episcopacy and about the wider struggle of\nreforming French bishops to stamp their authority upon the French Church,\nto achieve a relationship with the papacy and lower clergy which reflected\nthe status of their office and to underpin their activities as reformers with a\ncoherent theological base. These were difficulties faced by bishops elsewhere\ntoo, but they were perhaps most intensely evident within the seventeenth-\ncentury French Church with its strong Gallican traditions and intense\nde\u00b4vot atmosphere. By examining the responses of one particular prelate to\nthe dilemmas which he encountered in his episcopate, we learn how the\n26 Ibid. 183. 27 Forrestal, \u2018Fathers, pastors, kings \u2019, 109\u201335.\n28 In contrast, valuable studies have concentrated upon Camus\u2019 views of other aspects of\nreligion and society : Thomas Worcester, Seventeenth-century cultural discourse : France and the\npreaching of Bishop Camus, Berlin\u2013New York 1997 ; Jean Descrains, Bibliographie des \u0153uvres de Jean-\nPierre Camus, e\u00b4ve\u02c6que de Belley (1584\u20131652), Paris 1971, and Essais sur Jean-Pierre Camus, Paris 1992.\n262 AL I SON FORRESTAL\ncircumstances within which Tridentine bishops operated could affect their\nperceptions of the role and character of their office.\nIt was natural for a bishop like Camus, intensely pious and theologically\nliterate, to conceive a theology of episcopacy which was intended to provide\ncontemporary bishops with a composite image of the episcopal office. He\ncertainly felt that French bishops urgently required this kind of guidance in\ntheir quest to bring ecclesiastical order to their dioceses, especially since, as a\nresult of the religious conflicts, official Tridentine reform had begun later in\nFrance than in several other European states.29 His theology of episcopacy\nwas heavily influenced by contemporary French theological and spiritual\ncurrents. He absorbed emerging ideas on the role and position of bishops\nwithin the Church but also, crucially, adapted them for wider dissemination\nin his publications. Camus fitted ideas to the needs, as he saw them, of the\nFrench Church, which he believed required a united and self-assured epis-\ncopate to govern it effectively. So he did not simply regurgitate the ideas of\nothers, but wrote as one who felt a need to provide a coherent, but relevant,\ntheology of episcopacy which could guide prelates in their ministries. These\nconvictions provided the starting-point for his deliberations upon episcopacy;\nthey were the reasons for his lengthy defences of the office against its detrac-\ntors within the Catholic Church and for his anxiety to produce manuals of\ninstruction for his fellow bishops. While Camus\u2019 writings are representative\nof broad trends within French views of episcopacy, he was also an active\ndeveloper of a personal theology which he offered for the edification of other\nprelates.\nTo achieve this, Camus drew upon a long tradition of theology relating\nto the character of the episcopal office. It is possible to identify several the-\nological influences within his writings : for his pastoral theology, the lives and\nteachings of the early Church Fathers figured prominently, with Camus\nciting them as examples of appropriate behaviour and virtue for contem-\nporary bishops to follow. His pastoral theology was also indebted to Salesian\nhumanism, which is not surprising given that, until his death in 1622, de\nSales was Camus\u2019 closest advisor.30 At this point Cardinal Pierre de Be\u00b4rulle\nreplaced de Sales as Camus\u2019 spiritual guide, and his version of Pseudo-\nDionysian theology became the most striking and dominant influence upon\nCamus\u2019 thought. Camus, in fact, may be described as a prominent member\nof this French school of theology, which was centred upon Be\u00b4rulle but which\nwas to include such figures as Jean Eudes, Jean-Jacques Olier and Vincent de\nPaul as the century wore on. Yet, it is essential to note that Camus was not\nsimply a blind follower of any one theological authority : a learned and\nenergetic figure, he consistently reveals himself as someone with strong\n29 Martin, Gallicanisme et la re\u00b4forme catholique, 136\u201348, 261. The Assembly of Clergy published\nthe council\u2019s decrees in 1615.\n30 See their correspondence in Oeuvres comple`tes de Saint Franc\u00b8ois de Sales, Annecy 1892\u20131964.\nB I SHOPS IN TR IDENT INE FRANCE : J EAN-P I ERRE CAMUS 263\nopinions of his own, but also capable of filtering and refining theological\nviews.\nOne of the ways in which Camus demonstrated this ability was in his\nblending of theological strands to emphasise the integral nature of preaching\nto the episcopal ministry. He based this advice upon the recent directions of\nthe Council of Trent,31 but developed its bare guidelines using apostolic,\npatristic and Salesian teaching. So Camus cited Trent\u2019s decrees in calling\nupon bishops to preach regularly, but then proceeded to provide far more\ndetailed instructions upon that duty than the council had done. In advising\nprelates upon the theological justification for preaching, he initially linked\nthe episcopal duty to preach with the apostolic nature of the office through\nreference to the evangelising activities of the Apostles and first disciples. He\nsimultaneously stressed the paternal character of the episcopate.32 Cultivating\neffective preaching skills, with the ultimate objective of directing souls\ntowards salvation, was presented as a fundamental element of the bishop\u2019s\nrole as father. The concept of fatherhood was an ancient and venerable\nanalogy for the episcopal office, closely associated with the Pauline New\nTestament writings, but it could also be traced to the famous sixth-century\nPastoral rule of Gregory the Great, who had adopted it to enumerate the\npastoral virtues of bishops.33 Indeed, Camus expressly made this connection\nto Gregory\u2019s teaching, commenting in the Hierarque parfaict that his advice\n\u2018 to love robustly, to be rigorous, but without bitterness, to have circumspect\nzeal, accompanied by wisdom and moderation\u2019 was lifted from Gregory\u2019s\nteaching.34 Similarly, Camus regularly utilised the traditional biblical and\npatristic image of the good shepherd to highlight key characteristics of the\nepiscopal pastorate.35 Of course, Christ was the \u2018good shepherd\u2019 par excellence,\nbut, like fatherhood, this particular analogy had been carried down through\nthe centuries : John Chrysostom, in his fourth-century panegyric of Ignatius\nof Antioch, had presented the martyred bishop as a shepherd who, like\nChrist, had laid down his life for his sheep.36 Ignatius himself, in the letters\nwhich he wrote prior to his martyrdom, had explicitly linked the concepts of\nfatherhood and shepherd to episcopacy, when he urged that bishops be\nregarded as the earthly representatives of Christ, the archetypal father and\nshepherd.37 Through the medieval period, both \u2018 father\u2019 and \u2018shepherd\u2019 had\n31 Canons and decrees, sess.

Both enabled him to stress the\ndisciplinary authority of prelates over their children or sheep, but also their\naffection for them, and their duty to lead them through compassionate guid-\nance. There were dual aspects to these roles therefore: regulated discipline\nand loving advisorship. Strict government would keep children on the\nstraight and narrow path, while teaching and example would provide the\n\u2018spiritual nourishment\u2019 necessary to enable them to grow in faith and to\nattain salvation.39\nFor Camus, preaching was a highly effective means of instructing the\nfaithful and, as such, it was essential that all bishops cultivate the skill as much\nas possible. They did not need a natural capacity for eloquence in order to\ndischarge this obligation for \u2018 If they are faithful in this task, God will inspire\nthem \u2026 to degrees of Preaching that they could never have reached by\nstudying the most subtle Theology. \u2019 It was most important, therefore, to\npreach from the heart, to preach simply and clearly upon heavenly themes\naccording to the potential understanding of one\u2019s audience.40 This was a\nfirmly Salesian view, with the emphasis upon effective, direct preaching\nwhich was inspired by the Holy Spirit, rather than upon the cultivation of\ncomplicated rhetoric ; indeed, Camus directly attributed his advice to the\nwisdom of his former guide.41 To illustrate his point further, Camus pointed\nto the example of Charles Borromeo, former bishop of Milan and, by the\nseventeenth century, the most famous Tridentine bishop. This might appear\na rather misplaced choice, given that de Sales and Borromeo presented\ncontrasting episcopal styles, the former known for his Christian humanist\nspirituality and the latter for his rigorous institutional episcopalism.42 How-\never, Camus\u2019 choice is not so unusual when situated within its immediate\ndidactic context. He was determined to demonstrate that it was the inspi-\nrations and motivations for preaching which were the keys to its effective-\nness : Borromeo, according to Camus, was not a natural public orator, but\nhad followed the Gospel injunction to preach to all nations, so that \u2018he was a\npoor Preacher, according to the normal judgement of the world, but a very\n38 M.

His, then, was not simply a catalogue of precepts\nand duties ; rather, it was an attempt to inspire bishops by underpinning\nadministrative practicalities with \u2018divine\u2019 principles. Wishing, as he de-\nscribed it, to \u2018hold up a mirror in which [bishops} could contemplate \u2019 them-\nselves, he pointed to the illustrious origins of the episcopal office, tracing its\napostolic roots and unbroken succession through the ages,44 and then\nrepeatedly emphasised the need for bishops to cultivate the personal spiritual\nand moral perfection which would do justice to that glorious legacy. A life of\nvirtue, was, he realised, a basic requirement for any Christian, but the\nepiscopal office demanded of its incumbents a greater degree of virtue and\ntherefore of personal perfection than any other vocation.45 Before investigat-\ning precisely why Camus placed such emphasis upon perfection, we should\nfirst examine its characteristics as he presented them.\nThe good bishop, commented Camus, should not only discharge the\nadministrative duties demanded of him by the Council of Trent.46 It was not\nenough that he be resident, hold visitations and synods and preach; these\nactivities had to be inspired by his love for God and his flock. For Camus, this\nintense affection was manifested in the virtue of charity, with which the\nbishop\u2019s entire ministry should be infused. Charity was, therefore, the funda-\nmental bedrock of the episcopal vocation because without it, a bishop could\nnot possess the other virtues essential to the episcopate, namely, humility,\nzeal and piety. With charity underpinning these virtues, however, the bishop\nwould make \u2018powerful impressions upon the souls committed to him\u2019.47Natu-\nrally, a prelate must cultivate his faith and piety, through prayer, study and\nsacramental observance, so that he was positioned to nurture these in those\nunder his care.48 But, without humility, he faced the danger of becoming\n43 Camus, Borromee, 142. Camus also cited Jesus and St Paul as worthy models of effective,\nbut simply styled, preaching (pp. 157\u20138).\n44 \u2018 J\u2019ose icy vous representer a` vous mesmes tels que vout etes, que je vous estime, que je\nvous desire, et que vous devez estre \u2026 Je ne fay que tenir le miroir dans lequel vous pourrez\nvous contempler \u2019 : idem, Hierarque parfaict, preface (unpaginated), 84\u201390.\n45 \u2018Ce n\u2019est pas assez d\u2019estre prefere\u00b4 aux autres en dignite, si on ne les surpasse aussi en\nsaintete\u00b4 \u2019 : ibid. 162\u20135, citing St Jerome. 46 Ibid. 386\u20137, 559\u201364, citing Rom. ii.\n47 Ibid. 172 ; Borromee, 85\u20138; L\u2019Esprit, i. 360\u20131.\n48 Idem, Hierarque parfaict, 115\u201316, 162\u20133.\n266 AL I SON FORRESTAL\nexcessively proud of his position and of forgetting the nature of his vocation.49\nHis office brought great dignity, Camus noted regularly, but also great obli-\ngations of personal perfection and zealous, vigilant supervision of his flock.50\nCamus adopted the term \u2018irre\u00b4pre\u00b4hensible \u2019, meaning blameless or irre-\nproachable, to summarise the perfection desirable in a bishop\u2019s person, fre-\nquently calling upon prelates to live lives which would not be open to\naccusations of corruption, but which also, more positively, would be\nexamples for others to follow and would be congruent with their position as\nthe foremost representatives of \u2018 the House of God\u2019.51 Of course, Camus\nborrowed his desired virtues from orthodox spiritual teaching and openly\nrelated his own advice to that given in the New Testament, by early Church\nFathers like Jerome, Ambrose and Gregory the Great and by Franc\u00b8ois de\nSales. When he asked that prelates cultivate the virtue of charity therefore, he\nlegitimised this by citing Paul\u2019s advice to Timothy, but he also hailed\nFranc\u00b8ois de Sales as the contemporary model of perfect episcopal charity, a\nbishop who was fair, compassionate and loving towards his charges.52 Yet,\nalthough de Sales was Camus\u2019 favoured model, he also believed that charity\ncould manifest itself in more than one way, and he was able to call upon\nCharles Borromeo to illustrate this, in the sermon which he delivered at the\nChurch of St James in Paris in 1618.53 Here, Borromean charity was\ndescribed through a recitation of the archbishop\u2019s administrative activities,\nsuch as visitations, synods and the foundation of monasteries, all motivated,\nin Camus\u2019 view, by the charity which burned like \u2018a light \u2026 in the darkness\nof the century\u2019.54 At one level then, this was a different episcopal model to\nthat which Camus presented as personified in the late bishop of Geneva: for\nhim, Salesian charity was principally centred upon and manifested by the\nbishop\u2019s personal character when dealing with God and individual members\nof the faithful, while Borromeo\u2019s charity was indirectly revealed through his\nadministrative genius. Yet both styles were underpinned by the same essen-\ntial quality of episcopal charity so that, ultimately, Camus saw no profound\ndiscrepancy or incompatibility between them.\nAlthough Camus\u2019 vision of episcopacy contained plenty that was universal\nfare within Catholic episcopal theology, it was also strongly conditioned by a\nmore specifically French view of the office.

Adopting this view, Camus then\njustified his demand that bishops strive for personal perfection by pointing to\ntheir status within the ecclesiastical hierarchy and to the rights and duties\nwhich this brought.\nThe hierarchical schema underpinning Be\u00b4rullian thought retained the\nessential elements proposed by Pseudo-Dionysius, then still widely, though\nmistakenly, held to be the learned companion of St Paul and patron of\nFrance.55 Be\u00b4rulle was certainly not the first to incorporate modified Dio-\nnysian concepts into his own thought: indeed, variations of Dionysian hier-\narchy and mediation formed important elements of both medieval and early\nmodern thought and could be found in the theological views of, amongst\nothers, Thomas Aquinas, the humanist John Colet, the poet Edmund\nSpenser and the Protestant divine Richard Hooker.56 Be\u00b4rulle\u2019s particular\nversion of Pseudo-Dionysian hierarchy was designed to underpin the distinc-\ntive sacerdotal theology that he hoped would re-establish \u2018virtue and per-\nfection in the sacerdotal state \u2019.57 He divided his hierarchy into three triads,\nwith each of these then subdivided into ascending ranks. The first division\nwas subdivided into baptism, the eucharist and unction and the third into\nmonastic orders, initiates (or holy people) and catechumens (those not yet\nadmitted to the sacraments). Ordained priests formed the second rank of the\nmiddle triad while hierarchs and deacons formed the first and third ranks\nof this division respectively.58 Be\u00b4rulle has been described as initiating a\n\u2018Copernican revolution in theology and religious life \u2019, on the basis of the\n55 Pseudo-Dionysius was in fact a sixth-century Syrian writer who adopted the pseudonym\nof Denis the Areopagite, Paul\u2019s companion in Acts xvii. 34.\n56 Wayne Hankey, \u2018Dionysian hierarchy in St. Thomas Aquinas : tradition and\ntransformation\u2019, in Ysabel de Andia (ed.), Denys l\u2019Are\u00b4opagite et sa poste\u00b4rite\u00b4 en orient et en occident :\nactes du colloque international Paris, 21\u201324 septembre 1994, Paris 1997, 405\u201338, and \u2018Augustinian\nimmediacy and Dionysian mediation in John Colet, Edmund Spenser, Richard Hooker and\nthe Cardinal de Be\u00b4rulle \u2019, in Dominique de Courcelles (ed.), Augustinus in der Neuzeit : Colloque de\nla Herzog August Bibliothek de Wolfenbu\u00a8ttel, 14\u201317 octobre, 1996, Turnhout 1998, 125\u201360.\n57 Be\u00b4rulle\u2019s Projet de l\u2019e\u00b4rection de la Congre\u00b4gation de l\u2019Oratoire de Je\u00b4sus is contained in Correspondance\ndu Cardinal Pierre de Be\u00b4rulle, ed.

This principle was in place as\nearly as 1610: his projet for the establishment of the Oratory clearly enunciated\nthe reliance which would be placed upon the authority of bishops: \u2018 [The\nOratory] will be joined to prelates by the vow of obedience, regarding\nthe exercise and employment of ecclesiastical functions. \u2019 The character of\nobedience was further underlined in the projet\u2019s confirmation that no member\nof the congregation would actively seek employment from bishops or\nanticipate their commands.62 Be\u00b4rulle consistently claimed that relationships\nbetween bishops and priests should mirror that which existed between\narchangels and angels in the celestial hierarchy. In this analogy, priests were\nearthly angels acting as \u2018mediators on earth of God\u2019s counsels on his souls\nand works \u2019. Bishops, however, in correspondence to the relationship which\nexisted between the heavenly archangels and angels, were in command of\npriests since they were the earthly manifestation of archangels.63 So, although\nBe\u00b4rulle heightened the status of priesthood within his hierarchical pattern, he\nwas careful to elaborate a doctrine which placed bishops above them in\nauthority and which called upon episcopal authority to encourage clerical\nsanctification.\nThe cardinal also presented the bishop as grand-pre\u02c6tre, the figure who\nenjoyed the closest relations with God. For priests were mediators of God\u2019s\ngrace by virtue of the authority attributed to them by historical succession,\nbut bishops, in Be\u00b4rullian thought, were the supreme mediators whose auth-\nority could be traced to the early Church.

But the episcopate was also the most divinised rank of the ecclesi-\nastical hierarchy since it contained within itself the grace of all the ranks\nbeneath it and the clearest view of divine truths.64 The dignity of the epis-\ncopal office was therefore supreme within the ecclesiastical hierarchy. To live\naccording to the nature of that rank, it was essential to be regulated by the\nspirit of God in all things. Bishops were to \u2018use their hierarchical power only\nin the measure that they are moved by the Thearchy \u2026 for it would be sac-\nrilege for holy initiators \u2026 to act even once against the sacred ordinances of\nthe One who is the principle of their own initiation\u2019. In conformity with the\nmystical spirit of Be\u00b4rullian thought as a whole, complete self-renunciation\nwas vital in order to destroy personal will and serve God alone. It was he who\nwas to be \u2018 the end and principle \u2019 of the bishop\u2019s work.65\nAlthough Camus never referred directly to Pierre de Be\u00b4rulle in his\nwritings, it is obvious that his understanding of Dionysian hierarchy was\nprofoundly informed by the views of his spiritual advisor. Quoting Pseudo-\nDionysius verbatim, he regularly defined the bishop as \u2018A divine man, filled\nwith sacred knowledge, who first accomplishes in himself all the Hierarchical\nfunctions (which are to Purge, Illuminate, and Perfect oneself) and then com-\nmunicates them to others according to their condition and their capacity\u2019.66\nBut having based his own treatment of hierarchy on Dionysian structures,\nhe then went on to interpret them in a specifically Be\u00b4rullian manner. Like\nBe\u00b4rulle, Camus highlighted the integral link between hierarchy and\nauthority, granting the diocesan bishop extensive authority over priests and\nlaity by virtue of his position within the ecclesiastical hierarchy: \u2018Jurisdiction\nbelongs only to those who are ordained for the conduct of souls, it is not equal\nfor all, for that of cure\u00b4s is a lot less than that of Bishops \u2019.67\nCamus simultaneously presented the bishop as the supreme mediator, or\nthe grand-pre\u02c6tre of the ecclesiastical hierarchy. Again, he was here explicitly\nindebted to Be\u00b4rullian theology: when Camus outlined the relationship\nbetween bishop and parish priest, he distinguished the bishop by the title\ngrand cure\u00b4, the figure who possessed all the qualities of an ordinary parish\npriest, but in greater abundance and intensity.68 In part, this title referred to\nthe jurisdiction which a bishop enjoyed over his priests, but it also embraced\nthe other functions of his office. For the bishop, as an ordained priest, cer-\ntainly shared the sacerdotal function of communicating Christ through the\n64 P.

So, \u2018 the divine man, filled with sacred\nknowledge\u2019 purged sins, enlightened souls and drew them to virtue and\nultimately union with God.70 But he should first ensure that he matched the\nobjective dignity of his office with perfection in his own personal life.71 For\nthe episcopal office was objectively perfect, as Be\u00b4rulle too had been at pains\nto stress : \u2018Bishops are in a state of exterior and instrumental perfection \u2026 as\nmasters, tutors and doctors of perfection. \u2019 This status, however, demanded a\ncorresponding standard of virtue, otherwise the prelate would be \u2018 like the\nSun which warms all things without having any degree of heat in itself \u2019.72\nBe\u00b4rulle had also used this precise argument to encourage bishops towards\npersonal perfection. Since the episcopal office contained within itself the\ngrace of the ranks beneath it and the clearest knowledge of divine truths, the\nepiscopate was the most perfect hierarchical office, its members the most god-\nlike of creatures, and thus the supreme earthly images of God.73 So, for both\nBe\u00b4rulle and Camus, the ecclesiastical hierarchy was one of authority, me-\ndiation and sanctity, and because the episcopate was situated at its summit,\nits members must live according to the character and obligations of that\nposition. To do so, it was essential that the bishop be guided by the spirit of\nGod in all things. The \u2018enlightener\u2019 must therefore be fully receptive to the\ndivine will and to the truths communicated by God to him through the Holy\nSpirit. Personal \u2018divinisation\u2019, meaning holiness and intimacy with God,\nand selfless servitude were therefore key hallmarks of the office.74 In the in-\ntroduction to his 1634 work, Camus emphasised the concept of episcopal\nservice to the faithful and to God. The episcopate was a glorious and worthy\nvocation, he added, but one which demanded constant and tireless effort.75\nIII\nIn itself, a reassessment of episcopacy which stressed the dignity and\nperfection of the episcopal office as well as the spiritual and moral demands\nupon its incumbents would not necessarily arouse great hostility within the\nChurch. On the one hand, Camus\u2019 theology of episcopacy can be understood\n69 Idem, Considerations, 91\u20132.\n70 \u2018Dequoy sert que le bassin de la fontaine soit remply si le jardinage n\u2019en est arrose\u00b4, un\ntresor cache\u00b4 et dont on ne fait nul usage, est un tresor perdu. \u2019 : idem, Hierarque parfaict, 237 ;\nConsiderations, 64\u20135; Unite de la hierarchie, 39. 71 Idem, Hierarque parfaict, 12.\n72 Ibid. 649; L\u2019Esprit, ii. 11.\n73 Idem, Hierarque parfaict, 11\u201312; Cochois, \u2018Be\u00b4rulle \u2019, 348.\n74 Camus, L\u2019Esprit, i. 109\u201311 ; ii. 32\u20134, 316 ; iii. 214\u201315.\n75 Idem, Unite de la hierarchie, 7\u201314; Hierarque parfaict, 148\u201351.\nB I SHOPS IN TR IDENT INE FRANCE : J EAN-P I ERRE CAMUS 271\npartly as a product of the post-Trent reform atmosphere prevalent in France.\nHowever, it is also directly related to two other contemporary factors : the\nrelationships of bishops with regular clergy residing and operating within\ntheir dioceses and with the papacy. Both of these relationships were of crucial\nimportance to French bishops, profoundly affecting the nature and extent of\ntheir jurisdiction within dioceses. When he evaluated their implications,\nCamus provocatively extended the Be\u00b4rullian principles of episcopal authority\nand dignity to areas of theology and ecclesiastical discipline which the car-\ndinal, perhaps anticipating the potential pitfalls, had never felt obliged to face\ndirectly.\nAlthough Camus was not anti-regular per se, he certainly wished to submit\nreligious firmly to episcopal control, even if that meant drawing clear limits\nto the jurisdictional power of the papacy, a papacy which was growing in-\ncreasingly monarchical in its conception of its authority during this period.76\nIn his writings on hierarchy and episcopacy therefore, Camus painstakingly\ndefended episcopal jurisdiction and supported his claims with detailed the-\nological arguments. It is fair to say that there is occasionally more than an air\nof polemic to his writings against the regular clergy. He labelled their claims\nblasphemous and impious, and argued that their unwillingness to submit to\nepiscopal discipline would inevitably lead to complete disorder within the\nChurch, so that the \u2018masters \u2019 of the regulars, meaning the bishops, would\nbecome their slaves : \u2018 [The regulars] abuse their privileges so openly, preju-\ndicing Church peace, and confusing the Hierarchy, and the authority of\nOrdinary Pastors \u2019.77 But this dire prediction of an ecclesiastical world turned\nupside-down should be understood within its immediate context : Camus\nwrote in direct response to what he believed to be the indiscipline of reg-\nular clergy and their refusal to submit to the legitimate authority of diocesan\nbishops, a jurisdictional right which Trent had confirmed. Only when this\norder was achieved in practice, he felt, could true reform and renewal take\nplace within the French Church. If it did not, then it was quite conceivable\nthat chaos would reign.78\nEmbedded within Camus\u2019 framework of hierarchy was his understanding\nof the traditionally problematic issue of episcopal sacramentality. His writ-\nings adopted the Tridentine distinction between priesthood and episcopacy,\non the basis of the episcopal powers of order and jurisdiction held by bishops.\nIndeed, his stance also fits comfortably within his overall view of the epis-\ncopal office. At first glance, his position on sacramentality appears to have\nevolved through his career, though close inspection reveals that this was not\nactually the case: in 1634 he played little attention to the distinction of order\n76 Giuseppe Alberigo, \u2018L\u2019Episcopato nel cattolicesimo riformato xvi\u2013xvii secoli \u2019, in\nBernard Vogler (ed.), Miscellanea historiae pontificiae, Brussels\u2013Louvain 1987, viii. 268\u201386.\n77 Camus, Unite de la hierarchie, 114, 139\u201340; Considerations, preface (unpaginated).\n78 Idem, Unite de la hierarchie, 114.\n272 AL I SON FORRESTAL\nbetween bishops and priests, but stressed instead that a prelate\u2019s power of\njurisdiction distinguished him from a priest.79 However, since his 1634 com-\nposition on hierarchy was principally designed to highlight the supervisory\nand disciplinary authority of bishops over regular and secular clergy, this\nwould explain why Camus chose to stress their power of jurisdiction rather\nthan that of order. This is even more likely given that recently produced\nregular texts dealing with episcopal power tended to reduce the importance\nof episcopal jurisdictional authority, in order to weaken the claim of bishops\nto rights of government over religious.80 Evidently, Camus was willing to\ninterpret or even manipulate official ecclesiastical doctrine in ways that\nenabled him to enhance episcopal authority over lower clergy, for just eight\nyears later he altered the balance that he had earlier presented between the\npowers of order and jurisdiction. In his 1642 text, he explicitly embraced the\nnotion of a specific episcopal character which distinguished the office of\nbishop from that of priest. In this manual, moreover, he stressed that the\ndistinction of character was based equally upon both power of order and of\njurisdiction so that the episcopal office was not just an extension of the priest-\nhood but actually contained within itself specific powers to perfect and\ngovern.81 What these texts demonstrate above all, therefore, is that Camus\nwas extremely anxious to portray the office as a vital and unique hierarchical\nelement within the Church, whose incumbents were certainly priests but\nwere much more than corollaries of that ministry by virtue of their specific\npowers of ordination, confirmation and jurisdictional authority.\nIn stressing both the bishop\u2019s power of order and of jurisdiction, Camus\nfitted his understanding of episcopal government within his hierarchical\nscheme of mediation and authority. But addressing the question of episcopal\njurisdiction at all obliged him to examine the origin of that jurisdiction, par-\nticularly if he was to provide, unlike the Council of Trent, a comprehensive\ntheology of episcopacy that other bishops could adopt. The position which he\nassumed upon the origin of episcopal jurisdiction is extremely important\nbecause it is central to his understanding of the relationship between bishops\nand the pope and bishops and their clergy. As we noted above, he was\nheavily involved in public and acrimonious disputes with members of the\nregular clergy during the 1630s, most notably with the Capuchin Yves de\nParis, over the \u2018abuses \u2019 of unreformed religious. Even after his personal\nrelations with Paris improved in the late 1630s, Camus continued to advocate\nthe position that bishops possessed the jurisdictional authority to ensure that\n79 \u2018 [La juridiction] n\u2019appartient qu\u2019a` ceux qui sont ordonnez a` la conduite des peuples, elle\nn\u2019est pas egale en tous, car celle des [pre\u02c6tres] est beaucoup moindre que celle des Evesques \u2019 :\nibid. 52.\n80 An example of such a text is the anonymous Le Pacifique a` messieurs les e\u00b4vesques et curez : pour\nles religieux, Paris 1625. 81 Camus, Hierarque parfaict, 94\u20135, 390\u20136.\nB I SHOPS IN TR IDENT INE FRANCE : J EAN-P I ERRE CAMUS 273\nregular \u2018abuses \u2019 be eradicated.82 The issue was exacerbated by the very\npublic conflicts which other bishops had with regular clergy in their dio-\nceses.83 Camus proved one of the staunchest opponents of what he con-\nsidered to be the illegitimate attempts of regulars to extricate themselves from\nthe discipline of diocesan prelates, on the basis of papal privileges which\nplaced them under the direct authority of the pope. All of the texts which he\nproduced on episcopacy bear witness to the tensions between bishops and\nreligious during his career. He cites contemporary case studies to illustrate his\npoints. One of these was the 1633 clash between the episcopate and religious,\nincluding Jesuits, Carmelites, Augustinians and other orders, which resulted\nin the regulars being forced to sign a declaration, which they subsequently\nrepudiated, recognising that they could not preach or administer sacraments\nin dioceses without the permission of the appropriate bishop.84\nCamus was never afraid to raise and examine contentious points, even\nwhen he knew that he trod dangerous ground and risked regular and papal\nreproaches. As a result, he distinctly expressed his support for episcopal\nius divinum, as a basic principle of diocesan government. He utilised the ius\ndivinum doctrine to legitimate the authority of bishops over regulars within\ndioceses, even when religious claimed to be exempt from their governmental\ndiscipline as a result of papally granted privileges. This claim was vigorously\ncontested in Camus\u2019 writings; he argued that regulars could never be\nindependent of episcopal jurisdiction in their pastoral activities, but must\nalways seek their bishop\u2019s leave before attempting to preach or administer the\nsacraments. Camus advanced two reasons for this : in the first place, Trent\nhad categorically stated that parochial observance was the most effective\nmode of ecclesiastical organisation and that bishops had to ensure that this\nsystem was put in place.85 But they could not carry out this duty if regulars\nwere to be free of their governmental supervision. This first argument was a\npractical point therefore, based upon Trent\u2019s reform objectives. Camus\u2019\nsecond argument, however, was principally theological, and related directly\nto jurisdictional ius divinum.\nUnlike Trent, Camus offered a definite theological opinion upon whether\nepiscopal jurisdiction was held directly from God or from the pope. Bishops\nwere not only the direct successors of the Apostles, he claimed, they also held\ntheir jurisdictional authority directly from God. Camus could \u2018see none who\n82 Chesneau, Yves de Paris, i. 169\u201387; Griselle, \u2018Camus et Richelieu en 1632\u2019, 676\u2013711.\n83 Examples include Arnauld of Angers, Harlay of Rouen, Joly of Agen, Le Prestre of\nQuimper and Netz of Orle\u00b4ans.

The ramifications of this position on the ius\ndivinum of episcopal jurisdiction were clear : because the pope did not grant\nbishops their power of jurisdiction, he could not interfere in their dioceses.\nThe claim of papal privileges made by the religious was completely illegit-\nimate therefore, since the pope could not force bishops to accept exemptions\nfrom their jurisdiction through special privileges. For \u2018 if privileges were\npermitted despite [the bishops], and notwithstanding their just opposition, it\nwould remove the bishops\u2019 charges from them, and abolish the Episcopate,\nand all normal authority \u2019.88 Rather, the bishop could accept privileges if he\nwished, but if he chose not to do so, then this was his prerogative. No pope\ncould override the diocesan jurisdiction of a bishop, unless a bishop acted\ncontrary to established canon laws. In the case of privileges contrary to the\ndecrees of the Council of Trent, this was certainly not the case, because here,\nbishops acted in accordance with church laws. As Camus himself succinctly\nput it in 1634, the pope was \u2018Bishop of the Universal Church, but not Uni-\nversal Bishop\u2019.89 Camus was therefore a proponent of episcopal Gallicanism,\nmeaning that he ascribed considerable independence of government to\nbishops within their dioceses.90 Yet he would never have classified himself as\nanti-papal and, in fact, he defended the papal succession within the Church\nand denied that the pope himself intended to harm episcopal rights when he\noffered privileges. For him however, the papal\u2013episcopal relationship, was\none of \u2018unity of subordination\u2019, whereby the rights of each bishop were to be\nrespected and maintained.\nAt first glance, Camus\u2019 conception of hierarchical jurisdiction might\nappear contradictory. It accorded the pope primacy within the Church but\ndid not allow him to control the jurisdictional power of bishops within their\ndioceses, unless he acted to correct any violations of canon law. However, for\nCamus, there was no contradiction because the power of jurisdiction held\nby all bishops came not from the pope, but from God.

If one argued the\ncontrary, he claimed, then a dual hierarchy existed within the Church, one\nwith bishops (including the pope), the parish clergy and the laity and the\nother containing, in ascending fashion, members of the regular orders and\nthe pope.91 This could not be the case, both because established Church law\ndenied it and because it would lead to chaos in ecclesiastical government.\nMoreover, prelates were not mere delegates of the pope, but fellow bishops\nentitled to judge for themselves whether their dioceses needed the activities\noffered by \u2018privileged\u2019 regulars. When they decided that regular support was\nnecessary, they approved privileges and thus delegated regulars to carry out\nthe hierarchical functions of preaching and sacramental administration, in\nthe same way that bishops delegated parish clergy to carry out these essential\ntasks.92\nIn Camus\u2019 theology, bishops were thus accorded full power to weigh up\nimportant questions of ecclesiastical government within their dioceses and to\ndecide precisely what strategies would best suit the needs of the clergy and\nlaity under their care. They were \u2018doctors \u2019, he wrote, not only because of\ntheir ability to teach by preaching and instruction, but also in consequence of\nthe wisdom which they brought to all of the tasks under their jurisdiction.93\nIndeed, this was the manner in which he perceived his own literary activity ;\nas a prelate of the Church, it was his responsibility to judge matters of the-\nology in the light of his own wisdom, learning and spirituality and, sub-\nsequently, to present these views so that others could share and learn from\nthem. This could only benefit the Church and the faithful. Moreover, Camus\nalso perceived the bishop as the \u2018doctor \u2019, not only of those under his direct\ncare within his diocese, but of all members of the Church. Certainly there\nwere limits to a bishop\u2019s administration, since he held just one diocese,\nbut this did not prevent him from being actively and constantly concerned\nwith the welfare of the entire body of faithful. This assumption was a major\ndriving force behind Camus\u2019 publications.94\nWhen he formulated his theology of episcopacy, Camus was, at one level,\nanswering his own personal need for guidance in his vocation. Simul-\ntaneously, he was responding to what he believed to be a fundamental func-\ntion of the episcopal \u2018doctor \u2019 within a reform-active Church which needed\n91 Camus, Considerations, 94\u2013101, 175, 709, 718.\n92 \u2018Les Conventuels n\u2019exercent ces fonctions que comme Deleguez et Commissaires des\nEvesques envers leurs Diocesains, non comme Missionnaires du S.

Indeed, his desire to provide that guidance led to a\nquarrel which soured episcopal relations with the papacy and pushed his\nfellow French bishops towards a resolute defence of their office during the\n1630s and thereafter. But what is equally significant is that his writings\nprovide a revealing insight into the mind, and therefore, motivations and\nbeliefs, of a prominent seventeenth-century episcopal reformer and ulti-\nmately into the ecclesiastical culture in which he participated. As a bishop\nwho for many years did not possess a diocese and as an individual whose\noutspoken opinions aroused the wrath not of only the papacy but also of the\nformidable Richelieu, he might appear a rather idiosyncratic character. Yet\nthere is no doubt that, as a case study, Camus\u2019 episcopal ideal points clearly\nin the direction in which the French episcopate as a whole was moving\nduring the seventeenth century. In the wake of Trent\u2019s ambiguity over the\nunderlying questions concerning episcopacy, he expressed his support for\njurisdictional ius divinum a full fifteen years (1642) before the Assembly of\nClergy, the official and episcopally-dominated mouthpiece of the French\nChurch, would finally do so,95 and he was amongst the most vocal defenders\nof episcopal rights of leadership and authority vis-a`-vis the papacy and\nregulars. But crucially, his view of episcopal leadership and dignity was\ninfused with a strong spiritual and pastoral tone, the product of his associ-\nation with reformers such as de Sales and Be\u00b4rulle. Camus\u2019 experience high-\nlights the problematic ambivalences present within French Catholic reform;\nthe persistence of tensions between bishops, the papacy and lower clergy over\nthe most effective and legitimate means of achieving renewal and the most\nappropriate forms of ecclesiastical government, as well as the centrality of\nepiscopal perfection to an episcopate which was traditionally closely linked to\npolitics and secular society. Yet equally, his theology of episcopacy is a vig-\norously voiced, coherent adaptation of traditional and contemporary views in\nresponse to post-Trent circumstances, with disputed issues resolved to his\nsatisfaction and theological opinions blended and re-worked to accommo-\ndate the requirements of his own vocation and those of his fellow bishops.\n95 Me\u00b4moires de Godefroi Hermant, Paris 1906, iii. 278.\nB I SHOPS IN TR IDENT INE FRANCE : J EAN-P I ERRE CAMUS 277\n"}
