INTRODUCTION\nTHE PROPERTIES of cavity resonators (resonant fre-quency, factor, and shunt impedance) are commonly\ncalculated using finite-difference time-domain, finite-element,\nand other similar methods [1]. A variety of computer codes are\navailable for this purpose and the power of modern computers\nmeans that the properties of many cavities can be calculated\nquickly and with good accuracy. However, some commonly\nencountered geometries, such as the cylindrical reentrant cavity\nshown in Fig. 1, include sharp edges, which are difficult to\nmodel accurately using these methods. It is usually necessary to\nuse very large numbers of mesh cells to obtain good accuracy\nand the computational time becomes much longer.\nIn an alternative approach, the electric and magnetic fields in\neach region of the cavity are represented by infinite series of\nbasis functions, which are then matched by the imposition of\na continuity condition at . This method was proposed\nfor the reentrant cavity by Hansen [2] who assumed an approx-\nimate variation of the electric field on the boundary between\nthem. The resonant frequency of the lowest TM mode was de-\ntermined by matching the magnetic fields at the point .\nIn a further development of this method, Chu and Hansen [3]\nshowed that upper and lower bounds to the resonant frequency\ncould be obtained from assumed variations of the electric and\nmagnetic fields on the boundary by requiring that the flux of the\nreactive Poynting vector should be continuous at .

Cross section of a reentrant cylindrical cavity.\nmethod is closely related to that used by Schwinger to determine\nupper and lower bounds for the admittances of discontinuities\nin waveguides [4], [5]. A further important step was taken by\nTaylor [6] who showed that it is not necessary to assume the\nforms of the electric and magnetic fields. Instead, the field ex-\npansions in the two regions can be linked by the continuity equa-\ntions to give a determinant whose value is zero at the resonant\nfrequency. It has been shown [7], [8] that this process can lead\nto upper and lower bounds to the frequency and is effectively\na variational method. Since the method reduces the problem to\na matrix equation, it falls within the general class of moment\nmethods [9].\nThe problem of computing the resonant frequency of the\ncavity shown in Fig. 1 has been addressed by many other au-\nthors, see, e.g., [10]\u2013[14] and the references therein. However,\nTaylor\u2019s method is the best one available for this problem\nbecause the computation of upper and lower bounds to the\nresonant frequency means that the accuracy of the solution is\nalways known. This method is, therefore, valuable for the rapid\nand accurate computation of the properties of reentrant cavities\nand for providing a method by which the accuracy of results\nobtained by other methods can be checked. It can also be used\nto compute the properties of any resonant structure, which can\nbe divided into two or more simple regions in which the fields\ncan be expressed in terms of basis functions, which satisfy\nMaxwell\u2019s equations and the external boundary conditions [7],\n[8]. The purpose of this paper is to examine the convergence\nof Taylor\u2019s method and to show how it can be used to obtain\naccurate values for the resonant frequencies, factors, and\nshunt impedances of a wide range of cavities.

THEORY\nThe theory of the method presented here is based on that de-\nscribed by Taylor, but uses matrix algebra. This makes it easier\nto understand and apply. In region I, the axial component of\nand the azimuthal component of , which satisfy the boundary\nconditions on the axis, may be written as [6]\n(1)\nand\n(2)\nwhere the functions are defined in the Appendix, the prime\ndenotes differentiation with respect to the argument\n(3)\nand\n(4)\nwhere . Now, when , let\n(5)\n(6)\nwhere and are constant coefficients. Eliminating the co-\nefficients between (1), (2), (5), and (6), we obtain\n(7)\nwhere and are column vectors of the coefficients in (5)\nand (6) and is a diagonal matrix whose elements are\ndefined in the Appendix.\nA similar equation can be derived for region II as\n(8)\nwhere the elements of are defined in the Appendix\nand and are column vectors of the coefficients of the\nFourier expansions of and in region II at analo-\ngous to those in (5) and (6).\nThe condition that is continuous at for\nand if is\nif\nif\n(9)\nwhere . When both sides of (9) are multiplied by\nand integrated from to , we obtain the\nmatrix equation\n(10)\nwhere the matrix is defined in the Appendix. Similarly the\ncontinuity condition for at is\nwhen\n(11)\nWhen both sides of (11) are multiplied by and inte-\ngrated from to , we obtain the matrix equation\n(12)\nwhere the matrix is defined in the Appendix. It should be\nnoted that the boundary condition for when is auto-\nmatically satisfied by the distribution of the surface current.\nIt is now a simple matter to eliminate all the column vectors\nof the coefficients, except from (7), (8), (10), and (12) to\nobtain\n(13)\nso that the eigenvalue is the solution of\n(14)\nwhere is the unit matrix. This is equivalent to the solution\nobtained by Taylor [6] and Jaworski [14] (but note that the factor\nof 2 in [14, eq. (17)] is incorrect and should be replaced by\n2). If, alternatively, the column vector is retained, we find\nthat\n(15)\nThe derivations of (13)\u2013(15) assume that both series of basis\nfunctions contain an infinite number of terms. In practice, the\nseries must be terminated at and in regions I and\nII, respectively. Taylor [6] states that when the inner coefficients\nare eliminated, there is a discontinuity in at ,\nleading to an upper bound for , and that the elimination of\nthe outer coefficients leads to a discontinuity in and to a\nlower bound for . The existence of upper and lower bounds\nis said to be a consequence of regarding the truncated series\nof basis functions as a trial function in the variational sense.\nHowever, this explanation cannot be correct because when the\nsame choice of and is used in both (13) and (15), the same\nvalue of is computed in each case. It is, therefore, necessary\nto examine more closely the relationship between the method of\nmoments and the variational method implied by the truncation\nof the series.\nIII. VARIATIONAL METHOD\nThe variational method for this problem can be established\nin a simpler manner than in [7] and [8] by applying Poynting\u2019s\ntheorem [15] separately to the two regions. If the electric field\nis taken to vary with time as , then in region I,\n(16)\nwhere is the instantaneous stored energy in region and\nthe integral is taken over its surface. However, since we have\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library. Downloaded on December 19, 2008 at 06:47 from IEEE Xplore.

A similar equation can be written for region II. These\nequations may be added together to give the rate of change with\ntime of the total stored energy in the cavity as\n(17)\nwhere the integration is taken over the surface at . The\nnegative sign in the integrand is necessary because the flux of the\nPoynting vector in (16) is defined in terms of the outward normal\nfor the region. Now the left-hand side of (17) must be 0 at all\ntimes for the oscillations in a lossless cavity. When and are\nexact solutions to the problem, their tangential components are\ncontinuous when and the integral in (17) is identically 0.\nLet us now assume that the fields in the two regions are de-\nfined by two series of basis functions as above and choose to\ntruncate the series in the inner region when . If we re-\nquire that the continuity condition (9) is satisfied, then an infinite\nnumber of terms is required in the outer region. The coefficients\nof the magnetic fields in the two regions are given by (7) and\n(8), and we note that these depend upon . There is now a dis-\ncontinuity in when and the continuity condition (11)\ncannot be satisfied. We may, however, impose some other, ap-\nproximate, continuity condition and an approximate value of\nis then determined. Following Schwinger and Saxon [4], let us\nchoose that the flux of the reactive Poynting vector is continuous\nat . Equation (17) then shows that the total stored energy\nin the cavity is constant as, physically, it must be. Other possible\nchoices of approximate continuity condition do not guarantee\nthis. The flux of the reactive Poynting vector out of region I is\ngiven by\n(18)\nWe now make use of (5) and (6) and note that the basis functions\nare mutually orthogonal so that\n(19)\nwhere the expansion has been terminated at . In region\nII, the series is infinite and we have\n(20)\nWe use (10) to express (20) in terms of as\n(21)\nso that the approximate continuity condition is\n(22)\nNote that this expression is quadratic in the coefficients ,\nwhich are, as yet, undetermined. Their values can be found by\ntreating them as variational parameters and requiring that the\nvalue of should be stationary for small variations of them.\nThus,\n(23)\nThe first term is 0 when is stationary and the values of\nand are then the solution of the set of equations obtained by\nequating the second term in (23) to 0. It can be shown, after some\nmanipulation, that this condition, which is a linear function of\nthe coefficients, is identical to (13). Thus, the truncation of the\nseries in , while retaining an infinite number of terms in the\nseries in , leads to a stationary value of .\nThe same procedure may be carried out when the series for\nin the outer region is truncated at , while retaining\nan infinite number of terms in the inner region. The condition\nthat should be stationary is then (15). Chu [8] has shown that\nthe two values of determined in this way must be different\nand are upper and lower bounds to the exact solution. Thus, the\nmethod of moments naturally leads to upper and lower bounds\nfor through the truncation of the series of basis functions in\neither region. We see that the explanation offered by Taylor [6]\nis misleading and that it is the method of truncation, and not\nthe choice of coefficients to be retained, which leads to upper\nand lower bounds. These bounds are absolute limits and make it\npossible to determine the resonant frequency of the cavity with\nknown accuracy.\nIV. IMPLEMENTATION\nThe method described in Section III was implemented using\nMathcad 13.1 The solutions to (14) were found using the secant\nmethod, which was terminated when the fractional error in\nwas less than 10 . Once had been determined, the eigen-\nvector was obtained from (13) using the Mathcad function\neigenvec with an eigenvalue of unity. The eigenvector was nor-\nmalized to a gap voltage at . The other column vectors\nof coefficients for the electric and magnetic fields were obtained\nfrom (7), (8), and (10) so that the electric and magnetic fields\n1Mathcad 13 is a product of the Parametric Technology Corporation,\nNeedham, MA.

Convergence of frequencies computed for a cavity for which r =\n6:004 mm, r = 42:29 mm, z = 7:958 mm, and z = 22:792mm.\nthroughout the cavity could be computed to the level of approx-\nimation determined by the choices of and . The stored en-\nergy and the energy loss per cycle were obtained by inte-\ngrations over the volume of the cavity and over its surface so that\nthe factor could be calculated.

Finally, the ratio of the shunt impedance to\nwas calculated using [16]\n(24)\nwhere is the resonant frequency. The calculations usually\ntake a few seconds on a PC with a 3-GHz Pentium 4 processor\nand 1 Gb of RAM.\nV. CONVERGENCE OF THE METHOD\nThe convergence of the method outlined above was studied\nusing a cavity for which the frequency had been computed by\nJaworski [14]. Fig. 2 shows that the resonant frequencies com-\nputed for constant decreased smoothly to a lower bound as\nwas increased. Similarly, the resonant frequencies computed\nfor constant increased smoothly to an upper bound as was\nincreased. It can also be seen that the bounds obtained are nested\nwithin one another so that they are truly upper and lower bounds,\nas expected. In each case, the calculations were taken to (or\n) and the infinite limits found by linear extrapola-\ntion. It may be noted that when , the frequency is always\nclose to the upper bound. Fig. 3 shows the convergence of the\ninfinite limits to the upper and lower bounds as the number of\nterms in the truncated series was progressively increased.

APPROXIMATE METHOD\nFig. 2 shows that the frequencies computed using constant\nvalues of , while tending to a lower bound, give frequencies\nthat lie above the true frequency when is not much greater\nthan . In every case, there is a value of for which the fre-\nquency is close to the true frequency. Examination of this point\non each curve showed that a very good estimate of the final fre-\nquency can be obtained if is taken to be the closest integer\nto [ ]. This choice makes the length of the smallest\nwavelength of the basis functions approximately the same in\nboth regions. While this is intuitively attractive, we have not\nbeen able to find any theoretical reason why it should be so. The\napproximate frequency calculated using this relationship has the\nadvantage that good accuracy can be obtained without the need\nfor extrapolation of the results or for the use of large numbers\nof terms.

Shapes of the test cavities.\nfixing and increasing , as shown in Fig. 4. When\nand , the frequency is 2.1258 GHz to an ac-\ncuracy of 1.4 MHz and 0.9 MHz. In practice, the accuracy\nof the result is greater than this because it lies almost midway\nbetween the bounds. Fig. 5 shows the results obtained using the\napproximate method for values of . The frequency was\ncomputed using in this way up to and\nit was found that, for , the result is 2.1259 GHz to an\naccuracy of four decimal places. Thus, the frequency computed\nwhen is actually accurate to 0.004%.\nTo evaluate the usefulness of the approximate method, nine\nvery different cavities were selected from the set described by\nHamilton et al. [17], which were also used by Fujisawa [18].\nSince the shape of a cavity can be described by three normal-\nized dimensions, the objective was to investigate all combina-\ntions of the extreme values of these together with one case in\nthe center of the range. The shapes of the cavities are shown in\nFig. 6 where the numbering corresponds to that used by Fuji-\nsawa. The resonant frequency and of each cavity were\ncomputed to eight significant figures with .\nIn every case, the results were found to have converged to at\nleast five significant figures when . A study of the dif-\nferences between the results for and those for\nshowed that, in almost every case, the difference was less than\n0.005%. The exceptions were cavities 4 and 52 in which is\nFig. 7. Difference between the resonant frequencies of the test cavities com-\nputed with Microwave Studio and those obtained when N = 8.\nFig. 8.

For\nthose cavities, the differences were less than 0.01%, except for\ncavity 52 ( : 0.016%, : 0.011%). Thus, the properties of\nany cavity whose shape lies within the range of those computed\ncan be calculated with an error of less than 0.01% using the ap-\nproximate method and .\nVII. COMPARISON WITH OTHER METHODS\nThe properties of the cavities in Fig. 6 were computed using\nMicrowave Studio (MWS)2 with the default setting of automatic\nmesh refinement, which seeks the frequency to an accuracy of\nbetter than 1%. The differences between these results and those\nobtained with the approximate method are shown\nin Figs. 7\u20139. The differences are less than 1.0% for the fre-\nquency, 2.2% for the factor, and 5.7% for . The frequen-\ncies and factors show signs of systematic errors of around\n0.5% and 1.4%, respectively.

Difference between measured and calculated frequencies.\nfour cavities using MAFIA-2D, which employs the same algo-\nrithm as Microwave Studio, but which assumes cylindrical sym-\nmetry. The first three of these were selected because the dif-\nferences between the results obtained by the two methods had\nbeen particularly large in previous tests. The results in Table I\nshow excellent agreement. The resonant frequency of cavity\n60 calculated using MAFIA-2D and extrapolated to an infinite\nnumber of mesh nodes was 9.5339 GHz. Calculations using\nMWS and more than 2 million mesh points gave a frequency of\n9.53032 GHz. Extrapolation of the MWS results to an infinite\nnumber of mesh points gave 9.5341 GHz. The total CPU times\nusing a PC with a 2.8-GHz Xeon processor and 2-GB RAM\nwere 2 h for MAFIA-2D and 6 h for MWS. The comparison\nshows that very close agreement can be obtained between the\nresults from the different methods if sufficient care is taken.\nThe resonant frequencies of cavities for which experimental\ndata is available [11], [12], [14] were computed using the ap-\nproximate method . The upper and lower bounds were\ncomputed by increasing and , respectively, by a further\nfactor of eight. The differences between the measured frequen-\ncies and those computed, shown in Fig. 10, are generally less\nthan 0.5%. The upper and lower bounds lie within 0.1% of\nthe approximate frequency with a single exception (cavity 7,\nupper bound, 0.12%). The correction for the difference between\na cavity with walls of infinite and finite conductivity was com-\nputed using [19]\n(25)\nand found to be less than 0.02% in every case. This is much\nsmaller than the differences observed so that the error involved\nin assuming that the boundaries are perfect conductors is neg-\nligible. If the relative permittivity of air is taken to be 1.00054,\nthe change in frequency is 0.03%, which is also negligible. If\nit is assumed that (the most sensitive dimension) is in error\nby 10 m, the change in the frequency is of the order of 0.1%. It,\ntherefore, seems probable that the differences shown in Fig. 10\nare caused by experimental errors.\nVIII. CONCLUSION\nA detailed study has been carried out of the method pro-\nposed by Taylor [6] for computing the properties of cylindrical\nreentrant cavity resonators. This method is superior to those de-\nscribed by later authors and seems to have been overlooked by\nthem. The theory of the method has been presented in terms\nof matrix algebra, which makes it simple to implement. The\nupper and lower bounds to the resonant frequencies of cavities\ncan be computed by suitable choices of the numbers of basis\nfunctions in the inner and outer regions. It has been\nshown that this is equivalent to the variational method proposed\nby Schwinger for calculating the properties of discontinuities\nin waveguides. The method is capable of any desired accuracy\nif sufficiently large numbers of basis functions are used. It has\nbeen shown that, when the numbers of basis functions in the two\nregions are linked by a simple empirical formula, the frequency\ncomputed lies very close to the exact value. Tests with cavi-\nties of widely differing shapes showed that this result is valid\nfor all cavities of this type. For practical purposes, it is suffi-\ncient to choose ; the resonant frequency, factor, and\nare then generally accurate to better than 0.01%, which\nis more than adequate for most purposes. It has been shown\nthat the results agree with those extrapolated from computa-\ntions using Microwave Studio and MAFIA-2D to an accuracy\nof better than 0.002%. Comparisons with the results of exper-\niment and of computations using Microwave Studio, with au-\ntomatic mesh refinement set to 1% accuracy in the frequency,\nshowed differences in the resonant frequencies of less than 1%.\nThis method provides a fast and accurate way of com-\nputing the properties of reentrant cavity resonators, disc-loaded\nwaveguides, and other similar microwave structures. It is valu-\nable for benchmarking results obtained by other methods.\nAPPENDIX\nThe radial variations of the fields in (1) are given by\notherwise\n(A1)\nwhere and are Bessel functions using the usual notation.\nThe corresponding expression in region II is\notherwise.\n(A2)\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.
