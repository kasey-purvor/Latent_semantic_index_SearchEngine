Introduction\nFerroelectric thick films can be developed for inclusion in MEMS technology for the fabrication of\ntransducers working in thickness mode. These devices can be made from polycrystalline ceramics. This\ninvolves two fabrication steps: preparation of the green ceramic and sintering. A PZT powder\/fluid\n(water, oil or alcohol) slurry allows one to deposit films with thickness ranging from micrometers to\nmillimetres via several methods, such as, tape casting (up to millimetres)1,2, and screen printing (up to\nhundreds of microns).3,4 Unfortunately the powder route must have a high temperature sintering stage,\ntypically above 1200\u00b0C, and also presents many technical difficulties to achieve the fabrication of\nuniform films tens of micrometers thick.\nFor piezoelectric applications wet chemical methods (sol-gel) have been used because of the very low\nsintering temperature, 600\u00b0C, which allows films to be integrated onto substrates such as silicon. A\nsecond advantage is the grain uniformity in terms of size distribution and composition that this technique\ngives, which is a key factor needed to achieve reproducibility of piezoelectric characteristics. However, a\npure sol-gel technique only gives films with a maximum thickness of ca.3 \uf06dm.5\nThe main challenge is to fabricate PZT thick films with a thickness ranging from 10 to 40 \uf06dm and to keep\nthe advantage of the low sintering temperature of the sol-gel method.\nA mix between the two techniques presented allows these conditions to be met. A composite PZT\nPowder\/Sol slurry used in our work can be spun to achieve different thicknesses ranging from 2 \uf06dm up\nto 35 \uf06dm with a sintering process at 720\u00b0C. This is a good trade off between a powder route, and a pure\nsol gel procedure. The thickness of 35 \uf06dm for single or multi layer structures are state of the art and are\nsuitable for several new industrial applications such as transducers for high frequency imaging using the\nthickness mode of excitation.\nThe spin coating technique was chosen for deposition, because it offers a greater flexibility in thickness,\neven if this range of thickness for spun PZT films have not previously been made.6\nThis paper summarises the process required to go from the sol gel through to the final shaped\nstructures.\n2. PZT sol-gel and composite slurry\n2.1. PZT sol-gel7\nThe general formula of the sol used was: Pb1.1 [Nb0.02Sb0.02Mn0.02(Ti0.48Zr0.52)0.94]O3.\nFigure 1 shows the fabrication steps of the sol. The 2-methoxy-ethanol and the lead-acetate solution\nwere mixed together and the resulting solution was refluxed under N2 to drive the hydrolysis\npolymerisation. At this stage the solution was cloudy. The synthesis was completed by a long final\ndistillation to remove the by-products. A first plateau is observed at 90\u00b0C which corresponds to the\nF. Dauchy, R.A. Dorey, Patterned crack-free PZT thick films for micro-electromechanical\nsystem applications, Int J Adv Manuf Technol, 2007, 33, 1, 86-94\nboiling point of propanol used as a solvent to stabilize the zirconium propoxide. A second plateau is\nobserved at 102-104\u00b0C to remove, physically, the water. The sol becomes yellow and clear. The\namount of solution removed, during the final distillation, is replaced by the same amount of 2-methoxy-\nethanol to reach a concentration of 1.1M. The sol is filtered and stabilized by the addition of ethyl-\nglycol.8\nFig. 1. Flow Chart showing the fabrication steps used to produce the PZT sol\n2.2.Composite slurry\nA sol-gel method combined with PZT powder will be useful for thick film deposition. During the sintering\nprocess atomic diffusion in the PZT powder grain occurs to minimise the surface energy which promotes\ncrystal bonding at the interface between two adjacent particles. The added sol will increase the driving\nforce of the system due to the presence of nanoscale particles and so lower the required sintering\ntemperature. In addition the sol will also act like a glue binding the larger particles together and to the\nsubstrate.\nWith a pure sol gel route the substrate, generally a Si\/SiO2\/Pt wafer, will be the \u201cseed\u201d inducing the\ncrystallisation. In the case of the composite sol gel route, each microsize PZT grain will act as a site for\ncrystallization.\nThe composition of the composite slurry is summarised in table 1. All of the components were mixed\ntogether under nitrogen in a 125ml flask. The slurry was then ball-mixed for 24 hours to produce a stable\nsuspension. The slurry obtained has a density of 2.2 g.ml-1.\nTo enhance densification of the film a small amount of sintering aid Cu2O-PbO was added. This\nsintering forms a low temperature liquid phase during the sintering process, and accelerates the atomic\ndiffusion at the grain surface9, further increased the density of the ceramic. The composite slurry is\nsintered at 720\u00b0C, following patterning.10\nTable 1\nComposition of the composite slurry\nPZT Powder (PZ 26, Ferroperm, DK) 45 g\nDispersant KR 55 (Ken React Lica 38, IPA isooctylalcohol) 0.9g\nPZT Sol 30ml\nSintering aid Cu2O\/PbO 0.3105g\/1.926g\nZirconia ball milling media 200g\nLead Acetate trihydrate (52.5g) +\nAcetic Acid 99.8 wt% (30ml)\nDistil to remove water from system\n(20 ml off)\nTitanium isopropoxide 99.99 wt% (17.685g)+\nZirconium propoxide 76 wt% (27.328g)+\n2-Methoxyethanol 99.8 wt% (50ml)+\nDopants:\nNiobium (V) Ethoxide 98 wt% (0.629g)+\nAntimony (III) Ethoxide (0.508g) + Manganese\n(III) acetate 98 wt% (0.342g)\nUnder nitrogen atmosphere\nReflux for 3 hours\nVacuum distil\nAdd Ethyl-glycol 99.8 wt% (5g)\n+ Vacuum filtration (0.3 \u00b5m)\nMix\nReflux for 3 hours\nUnder nitrogen atmosphere\nReflux for 3 hours T=104 \u00b0C\nLead Acetate solution 2-Methoxy-Ethanol solution\nF.

PZT Deposition\nDuring the sintering process some Pb, from the PZT layer, diffuses into the silicon wafer substrate, to\nform lead silicate which is liquid at the sintering temperature. (Fig 2)\nFig 2. Holes produced at the Si\/PZT interface due to diffusion of the Pb into the Si substrate during\nsintering.\nTo prevent this undesirable reaction a ZrO2 diffusion barrier (table 2) was first spun on the silicon\nsubstrate.\nTable 2\nComposition of the ZrO2 diffusion barrier sol\nZrO2 diffusion barrier Qty\nZirconium propoxide (75 wt % in propanol) 4.344 g\nAcetic acid (at 99.8 wt %) 3 mL\nEthanol anhydrite 47 mL\nThese components were mixed under nitrogen and stirred for 1 hour. The sol was spun at 3000 rpm for\n30 seconds, and dried at 350\u00b0C. This stage was repeated three times. The film was then sintered at\n800\u00b0C for 10 min. The final thickness is 60 nm.\nSputtered Pt bottom electrodes were then shaped with a lift off process. The photoresist S1818 was\nspun at 4000 rpm, dried for 90 seconds at 115\u00b0C, and partially exposed under UV light for 10 seconds,\nand then developed in MF319 developer.\nAn adhesion layer of PZT sol was spun before spinning the composite slurry in order to avoid any\ndelamination. This step was done for all films thicker than 21 \uf06dm.\nPZT was deposited by fully coating the substrates with the composite suspension and then spinning at\n2000 rpm for 30s. The deposited film was then dried at 200\u00b0C for 60s and pyrolysed at 450\u00b0C for 30s to\nremove all the organic components..\n4. Infiltration steps\nThe composite slurry process, even when using the sintered aid, still results in a low density film after\nsintering. This was overcome by repeated sol infiltration to increase the green density prior to sintering.\nAn infiltration step consists of spinning a layer of a sol, diluted in 2 methoxy-ethanol (2ME) solution, on\nthe green ceramic (1:1 sol: 2 ME). The added sol will directly crystallise in the pore and fill them. This\nincrease in density is shown in figure 3 and confirmed by an increase in of the relative permittivity with\nthe number sol infiltrations. (Fig. 4)\nEach infiltration step was followed by drying and pyrolysis treatments, at 200\u00b0C and 450\u00b0C respectively\nbefore the next infiltration step. The next composite layer was then deposited and the process was\nrepeated until the desired thickness was obtained.\na) 2 sol infiltrations b) 3 sol infiltrations\nF. Dauchy, R.A.

This thickness achieved is state of the art for a spin coated PZT ceramic, and not previously\nhas been reported. The figures 5 to 7, represent the evolution of the surface with the thickness. The\nsurface finish of films composed of 12 or more composite layers shows some cracking. The width of\nthese cracks can be reduced to 10\u2019s of nanometers by covered the surface with a pure sol (Fig.7b). This\nstep allows this ceramic to be used for MEMS applications as a continuous top electrode, as thin as\n100nm, can be sputtered on the surface.\nFig 5.

Some of the infiltration sol remains on the surface of each composite layer, which\nmarks the observable separation between the two (Fig 6). This effect is also observable during the wet\netching process: Fig 14 shows a stepped pyramidal shape due to the presence of this interlayer sol.\nThe work presented by [Zhang, et .al, 2005] on pure sol, demonstrates that the interfacial sol layer is far\ndenser than the composite ceramic. These density differences may induce a considerable amount of\ntensile stress due to the differential shrinkage during the drying stage, which may lead the composite\nfilm to crack and delaminate.\nExperimentally, the cracks appeared during the drying stage at 200\u00b0C, and especially when the\ninfiltration sol did not totally infiltrate the PZT, indicating that the drying \/ shrinkage of the pure sol plays\na significant role in this process.\nPZTAir Si\na\nExample of infiltration sol\nremaining at the interface\nbetween two composites\nlayers\n40\u00b5m b\na\nSiPZTAir\nb\nc\nF. Dauchy, R.A. Dorey, Patterned crack-free PZT thick films for micro-electromechanical\nsystem applications, Int J Adv Manuf Technol, 2007, 33, 1, 86-94\nA trade off between dielectric properties and a better surface finish can be made. To do so, some\ninfiltration stage causing the interfacial PZT layer can be eliminated along with the accompanying stress.\nIt will lead to a crack free thick PZT film.\n5.2 Thick film [2C+4S]\nThe process [2C+4S] corresponds to two infiltration steps per composite layer. The infiltration sol\nremaining between two composite layers, observable in Fig 7, is not observable with the new process\n(Fig 8). The cracking situation is improved significantly even for a thick layer of 28\u00b5m, where the surface\nfinish remains better than for a 10\u00b5m thick film for the first process [C+4S]. Such a reduction in cracking\nwould arise either due to a reduction in stress or an increase in material strength. However, as strength\nis expected to decrease with increasing porosity, it s reasonable to assume that the cracking is\neliminated in these (more porous) films due to a reduction in stress.

SEM micrograph of cross sections of x[2C+4S] film, showing the film to be more porous than the\n[C+4S] process shown on fig 6.\nIt is expected that these ceramics contain higher porosity than the x[C+4S] ceramics, as they have\nbeen infiltrated to a lesser degree. As a consequence the relative permittivity is reduced from 700 to\n7[2C+4S] 28 \uf06dm\nSi\n6 [2C+4S] + 4infiltratrions (22\uf06dm)\nSi PZT Air\nPZT Air\nF. Dauchy, R.A.

However, this process represents a real breakthrough regarding the thickness (28\uf06dm) of such\nthick films, as well as for the surface finish achievable. As an example of the quality of surface finish\nachievable with this process, Fig. 8 a) represents a 22\uf06dm crack free thick PZT film with a 100nm\nelectrode sputtered on its surface, showing that a continuous electrode can be deposited.\n6. Multilayer PZT thick film\nThe composite sol gel process offers the potential for great adaptability for thick fabrication, particularly\nof shaping the final device.

The\ntop, bottom and middle Ti (9nm) \/Pt (100nm) electrode were deposited by sputtering.\nThe multilayer process shows a great adaptability in being able to deposit multiple thin (100nm thick)\nmetallic embedded electrodes in a PZT Structure.\n7. Patterning\n7.1. Wet etching solution\nThe solution used to etch the green ceramic was a HF\/ HCL solution with the following composition [HF\n(0.5 vol%), HCl (4.5 vol%), H2O (95 vol%)]. To be efficient the solution was held at 60\u00b0C during the\nprocedure.\n7.2. Patterning PZT thick films via wet etching\n7.2.1 Wet etching process of x[C+4S] PZT thick films\nConsidering the isotropy of the PZT thick film, a wet etching technique should etch, at the same rate in\nall the directions, which explains the etching slope, called undercuts, shown in Fig 11 and 12. The\nimmersion time in the etch solution was dependent on the thickness of the PZT. (Table 3)\nTable 3\nPZT etch rate for different thicknesses of PZT film etched (HF (0.5 vol%), H2O (95 vol%), HCl (4.5 vol%)\nTime to etch through thickness thickness etch rate\n7min 21 \uf06dm 3 \uf06dm\/min\n12min 30 \uf06dm 2.5 \uf06dm\/min\n15min 35 \uf06dm 2.3 \uf06dm\/min\nThere was an intermediate product produced during the process. When the PZT was etched a white\nlayer was left on the surface. An XRD study on wet etching done by Zheng 11 indicated that it was\nPbClF. In order to remove this residue, the sample was cleaned using water in an ultrasonic bath for 15\nminutes at the end of the etching process.\nTable 3 reveals that thicker films with more residue show reduced etching rates indicates that the PbClF\nresidue acts as a barrier which slows the etching process.\nThe edge resolution, as well as the etching slope, observed in all of the present pictures, seems to be\ndependent of the thickness and uniformity of the spun photoresist and the immersion time in the HF\nF.

The spinning process of the photoresist was conducted in one stage for the sample shown in\nFig 11 and two stages for that shown Fig 12. For the 21\uf06dm thick sample, the resist was spun at\n4000rpm for 1 min, while for the 30\uf06dm thick sample, the resist was spun first at 600 rpm for 1min and\nthen at 4000rpm for 1min. The undercut seems to be reduced in the second case, Figure 11 shows an\netching slope of 0.7, and Figure 12 shows a slope of 1. The thicker the resist is the longer the\nphotoresist takes to be removed by the HF solution, and the sharper the etching slope. achieved\nFig. 11.

SEM micrograph of a 30 \uf06dm PZT thick film, patterned with features of 50 \uf06dm at the surface and\n10 \uf06dm at the base.\nFig 11 and 12 represent the typical gap between two devices achievable by this wet etching technique.\nA kerf of ~60 \uf06dm between surfaces is shown in Figure 12 for a 30 \uf06dm PZT thick film. This result is the\nfinest result achievable with a wet etching technique considering the thickness and the isotropy of the\nfilm. The gap of 10\uf06dm between features at the silicon face is also of a technical interest (Figure 11).\nA hole with 150\uf06dm side at the surface of a 35 \uf06dm thick film shows the capability that the wet etching\ntechnique can achieve considering that: (Figure 13)\n- The photoresist patterning mask is designed with a hole with 110\uf06dm long sides\n- A minimum of 35 \uf06dm undercuts with an isotropic wet etching technique\nF.

Wet etching of PZT thick film [2C+4S]\nThe same wet etching process was tested on [2C+4S] thick films to determine how the absence of the\nsol interlays affects the etch process. (Table 4)\nF. Dauchy, R.A. Dorey, Patterned crack-free PZT thick films for micro-electromechanical\nsystem applications, Int J Adv Manuf Technol, 2007, 33, 1, 86-94\nTable 4 HF etching rate of the PZT thick film lead by the [2C+4S] process\nTime thickness etch rate\n5[2C+2S] 5.30min 22 \uf06dm 4.2 \uf06dm\/min\n6[2C+2S] +4Inf 6.15min 22 \uf06dm 3.6 \uf06dm\/min\n7[2C+2S] 6.50min 26 \uf06dm 4 \uf06dm\/min\nThe data comparison presented in table 3 and 4 demonstrates a faster etching rate for the second\nprocess than for the first. This result is consistent with the porosity assumption made in section 5 where\nthe porosity increases when the film is less infiltrated. With more porous film the HF solution can have a\nlarger reaction surface with the PZT.\nHowever, the \u201cstepped pyramidal\u201d etching shape observable in the first process (Fig 14, 12[C+4S]) is no\nlonger observed with the second process (Fig 15, 6[2C+4S]) as the interlayer sol is no longer present\n(see section 5.2). The higher density of the extra sol layer observed on figure 14 temporarily slows the\nthrough thickness etching rate (acting like a very thin protection layer against the etching solution)\nresulting in the stepped structure.\nFor a similar thickness, the etching slope is steeper for the first process than for the second one Fig. 15.\nBoth the porosity and the interfacial sol layer are responsible of this difference. Unfortunately as these\ntwo variables change together it is impossible to tell which has a major effect through this experiment.\nFig 15. Comparison between the etching definition of the two process, [2C+4S] and [C+4S]. The\nsamples are both 21\uf06dm thick\nThis great adaptability of the spin coated thick composite PZT layer allows a wide range of shapes to be\nrealised, some examples given are state of the art and can find application in various areas. The cross,\nshown in Fig 14, reveals the possibility of patterning a 10 \uf06dm wide bar of 21\uf06dm PZT thick film, which is a\nsignificant achievement over previous techniques. Both the surface finish and dielectric properties are\ntuneable for any thickness up to 40\u00b5m.\nThese processes could find many applications in MEMS fabrication for devices such as cantilevers,\nswitches and high frequency transducers.\n8. Conclusion\nPZT films up to 35 \uf06dm thick were fabricated, using a composite sol gel route combining a PZT powder\nand a PZT sol gel. The maximumtemperature for the process was 720\u00b0C.\nA demonstration of single and multilayer structures was given to show the flexibility of this technology. A\ncrack free surface finish of a 28\uf06dm thick film reveals the adaptability of the spin coating technique to\nfabricate thick films.\nThe wet etching technology revealed the possibility of a great adaptability to pattern and shape\ninnovative devices such as bars 10 \uf06dm wide of 21\uf06dm PZT thick film. The results open the way to a wide\nrange of new industrial application requiring small features and\/or multilayer PZT thick film with\nembedded electrodes.\nAcknowledgements\nDr. S. A. Rocks, R. V.
