This duality, long recognized and studied by \nphilosophers, psychologists, and artists (Gombrich, 1960; Ittelson, 1996; Bloom & \nMarkson, 1998) may be difficult for children to understand.  Young children naturally \n\u201csee through\u201d pictures. If they see a line-drawing of a whisk, for instance, and hear it \nnamed (\u201cThis is a whisk\u201d), they later extend the name to real-world whisks, not to other \ndrawings (Preissler & Carey, 2004). However, they may not appreciate, as adults do, \nthat the drawing is itself an object, a vehicle through which a whisk is represented. \nIndeed, young children sometimes treat a representation as if it were the represented \nobject, as when trying to shake a picture of a rattle or step into a picture of a shoe \n(DeLoache, et al., 1998; Perner, 1991).   \nHere we explore whether, when presented with a suitably simplified task, 2-\nyear-olds can flexibly see pictures as both representational and as objects in their own \nright. In our first study, we tested 30 2-year-old children (mean age: 30 months). Each \ntrial involved four items\u2014an unfamiliar object, a line-drawing of that object, a second \nunfamiliar object, and a line-drawing of this second object. In one condition, the \nexperimenter pointed to one of the drawings, described it with a novel word, and asked \nsubjects to generalize the word, e.g., \"This is a wug. Can you show me another one?\" In \nanother condition, the experimenter asked the same question without using a new label: \n\"Look at this. Can you show me another one?\" \n3 \nFor adults, common nouns refer to kinds of objects (see Bloom, 2000), and so \nthe \u201cwug\u201d question should be taken as applying not to the picture, but to what the \npicture depicts, and hence should be extended to the corresponding object.  In contrast, \nthe \u201cLook at this\u201d question is more likely to simply be taken as referring to the picture \nitself, and is therefore more likely to be extended to the other picture. These were the \nchildren\u2019s intuitions as well. When told about \u201ca wug\u201d, they chose the corresponding \nobject 90% (27\/30) of the time; when not given a word they chose the corresponding \nobject only 30% of the time (9\/30), a significant difference between conditions \nindicating reliable, opposite effects (27\/30 -> z = 3.45, p<.001; 9\/30 -> z = -2.36, \np<.05). This effect of a novel word is consistent with other research concerning the role \nof language for facilitating categorization by young children (Xu, 2002; Waxman & \nBooth, 2003).  \nIn a second study, we used a simpler design to test 20 2-year-olds (mean age: 30 \nmonths), by showing them a line-drawing depicting a novel object and making a \nstatement about the drawing.  These statements were either: (1) this is a dax; (2) my \nsister has this in her house; (3) this is really neat; (4) this is my favorite; (5) my brother \nkeeps this in his wallet. Some of these properties were intended to apply to the object \nthat the picture represented ((1) and (2)); others were intended to apply better to the \npicture itself ((5)), and others applied well to both ((3) and (4)). \nAfter the statement was presented, the experimenter brought out the object that \nthe drawing depicted, placed it next to the drawing, and asked which item(s) the \nproperty applied to (e.g., \u201cCan you show me the one my sister has in her house?\u201d)\u2014the \ndrawing, the object, or both. We also tested twenty adults with the same design telling \nthem that we were validating a paradigm used with children.    \n4 \nThe results are shown in Figure 1.  Note first that we replicate the finding for the \nfirst study\u2014when a picture is named, children (and adults) assume the label refers to a \nrepresented object.  Both groups associate some statements mostly with objects (1, 2) \nothers mostly to pictures \u2018wallet\u2019 (5), and still others both to pictures and to objects (3, \n4).  For children, the difference between the average score of the \u201cdax\u201d and \u201chouse\u201d \ntrials and the \u201cwallet\u201d trial is significant (paired two-tailed t test, t(19) = 2.90, prep = .96, \nd = 1.33), as it is for adults (paired two-tailed t test, t(19) = 3.76, prep = .99, d = 1.72).  \nResults of difference scores between children and adults are not significant (between-\nsubjects ANOVA, F(1, 38) = .017, prep = .192, \u00012 < .001).  This suggests that children, \nlike adults, understand that labels refer to depicted objects, and that other property \nstatements can flexibly be applied to pictures or to objects. \nChildren who are considerably younger than those tested here are capable of \nusing and understanding symbolic representations\u2014even 12-month-olds can use and \nunderstand words.  This is the first demonstration, however, that young children can \nappreciate the dual nature of visual representations.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n5 \n \nReferences \nBloom, P.  &  Markson. L.
