INTRODUCTION\nElectronic devices whose functionality is determined by\nthe orientation of electron spin are described as spintronic\ndevices.1 One focus of this work has been the attempt to\ncreate a hybrid ferromagnet-semiconductor device based on\nthe Datta and Das spin transistor.2,3 Significant progress has\nbeen made with all semiconductor systems using dilute mag-\nnetic semiconductors as the source of spin polarized current.\nIn the case of BeMnZnSe, 90% efficiency spin injection into\nGaAs has been observed,4 albeit below 5 K and in high mag-\nnetic fields. Spin injection from ferromagnetic metals into\nsemiconductors requires a tunnel barrier5\u20137 to overcome the\nconductance mismatch problem. Indeed relatively efficient\nroom temperature spin injection has been reported in\npermalloy-alumina-AlGaAs\/GaAs light emitting diodes8 and\npermalloy\/Schottky barrier\/GaAs diodes9 demonstrating the\npossibility of a viable route to room temperature hybrid spin\ndevices using these material systems.\nDatta and Das originally proposed a spin transistor using\nFe contacts on a narrow gap semiconductor.3 NiMnSb should\nbe a more suitable alternative to Fe as it is supposedly a half\nmetallic ferromagnet10 with a Curie temperature of 728 K.11\nIt also has only a 2.4% lattice mismatch with the narrow gap\nsemiconductor InAs. No successful devices using NiMnSb\nhas been reported to date and relatively few measurements of\nthe polarization. Spin polarized photoemission measure-\nments determine the bare polarization sPd of the density of\nstates at EF and P at the free surface of NiMnSb have been\nreported to be about 50%.12 Planar NiMnSb\/AlO3\/Ni20Fe80\ntunnel structures were used13 to estimate the polarization of\nthe tunnel current Pm=28%. Preliminary measurements of\ntransport spin polarization of NiMnSb thin films using the\npoint contact Andreev reflection (PCAR) technique estimate\nPi=58%.14 A more recent study using PCAR has reported a\nvalue of ,45% for single crystal NiMnSb.15 The latter mea-\nsurement was part of the initial demonstration study of the\nPCAR technique and Pt was determined using a crude\nmethod valid only for a clean interface between the super-\nconducting point contact and the metal surface.\nIn the current paper, we have used the PCAR technique to\nexplore the transport spin polarization of bulk NiMnSb that\nis to be used as a target for pulsed laser deposition. The data\nhas been analyzed in terms of the extension to the Blonder,\nTinkham, and Klapwijk (BTK) theory developed by Mazin\nand co-workers.16 This model has been applied previously by\nother groups to analyze the transport polarization of CrO2,17\nSrRuO3,18,19 and La1\u2212xSrxMnO3.20 Recently it has been\nshown that this approach may have limitations for certain\nmaterial systems because the reflection of conduction elec-\ntrons at an interface between a nonmagnetic metal and fer-\nromagnetic metal can be strongly spin dependent.21,22 There\nis also the problem that the model does not take into account\nspin dependent transport across the barrier.14,16 However ex-\nperimental conductance spectra fit extremely well to the ex-\ntended BTK model. It is believed that this is due to the\ndimensionless barrier parameter sZd containing more physics\nthan simply the strength of the d-function barrier.23 In the\ncase of significant spin dependent reflection due to a mis-\nmatch of the Fermi velocities it should not be possible to\nPHYSICAL REVIEW B 69, 214425 (2004)\n0163-1829\/2004\/69(21)\/214425(5)\/$22.50 \u00a92004 The American Physical Society69 214425-1\nobtain spectra where Z=0. The fact that in some cases such\nspectra are obatined suggests that this is not always a signifi-\ncant effect. As Zutic and Valls22 point out, Z cannot simply\nbe rescaled due to Fermi velocity mismatch, and hence we\ndo not attempt to do so.\nThere is also controversy with the PCAR technique due to\nthe quality of fitting of the conductance spectra to the current\ntheoretical model. It has been reported that in certain cases\nthere is no unique solution.24 Here we report a study of fit\nquality as a function of both Pt and Z, which demonstrates a\nsingle minimum in the goodness of fit. This provides a\nunique solution to the model and an estimation of the error in\nPt. Structural, compositional, magnetic, and electrical char-\nacterization of the NiMnSb samples was also carried out in\norder to better understand the polarization results obtained.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE\nTwo polycrystalline bulk NiMnSb samples were produced\nusing MSR2 RF equipment (Cambridge Ltd., Cambridge,\nU.K.), from high purity Ni s99.8% d, Mn s99.9% d, and Sb\ns99.999% d powders (Alfa Aesar, Johnson & Matthey,\nKarlsruhe, Germany) mixed in stoichiometric proportions\n1:1 :1. The two bulk samples have different preparation pro-\ncedures prior to rf melting. One was formed directly from the\nmixed powder (Prf) and the other was pressed and sintered\ninto an ingot25 before melting (Irf). Structural, magnetic, and\nelectrical properties of films made from similar bulk material\nhave been reported elsewhere.26 For the melting\/\ncrystallization process, the material was placed into an alu-\nmina crucible then developed in argon at atmospheric pres-\nsure following the temperature regime in Fig. 1. The\nstoichiometry of the bulk material was measured using en-\nergy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX) that was per-\nformed using an XL 30 ESEM LaB6 (Philips Optique Elec-\ntronique, Paris, France).\nFurther treatment of both samples was undertaken to\nclean the surface and to remove the native oxide layer (tem-\nporarily). Wet chemical etching with 10% hydrofluoric acid\n(HF) was used for this purpose. Contradictory to previously\nreported etching of NiMnSb which shows a constant etch\nrate,27 we find that the etch removes the native oxide and\npossibly a constituent from the surface of the NiMnSb ma-\nterial. This leaves a surface that is resistant to further etching,\neven to 50% HF solution. On exposure to air this surface\nvisibly oxidizes within minutes. This fresh oxide layer can\nthen be removed by further etching in HF, which can be used\nto provide a well controlled etch of NiMnSb. Polarization\nmeasurements were taken shortly after etching, but not be-\nfore surface reoxidization.\nMagnetization measurements were performed using an\nOxford Instruments vibrating sample magnetometer. Trans-\nport spin polarization of the samples was determined using\nPCAR,14 with a superconducting niobium tip which has been\nformed mechanically. The physical tip size is approximately\n5350 mm though from the magnitude of the contact resis-\ntance sRCd the actual contact size sdd is believed to be much\nsmaller. The size of d can be approximated from the general\nexpression28\nRC <\n4\n3p\nrl\nd2\n+\nr\n2d\n,\nwhere r=15 mV cm for NiMnSb at 4.2 K and l is the mean\nfree path. Note that this expression neglects the interface\ntransparency and therefore under estimates d. Nevertheless\nin the present case the data is best fit to the extended BTK\nmodel in the ballistic limit meaning that d!l. For NiMnSb\nwe estimate l to be of the order of 20 nm. Hence although\nthe point contact tip radius is of the order of microns the\nactive geometry must be an assembly of parallel nanocon-\ntacts.\nAll measurements were made with the contact and sample\nimmersed in liquid helium at 4.2 K. The contact resistance\ns1\u2013200 Vd was measured using a standard four-point con-\nfiguration. A slowly varying current with a small amplitude\nripple was driven through the junction. The differential con-\nductance as a function of the dc bias was obtained by mea-\nsuring resulting voltage oscillations using a lock-in amplifier.\nIII. RESULTS\nEDX measurements of composition shown in Fig. 2 dem-\nonstrate that the preparation route has a significant effect on\nstoichiometry. The pressing and sintering of the Ni, Mn, and\nSb powder prior to rf melting forms a bulk material with\nclose to the desired stoichiometric ratio of 1 :1 :1, Fig. 2(b),\nFIG. 1.

The low temperature\nsaturation magnetization sMsd of the samples are almost\nidentical, with an effective moment meff=3.60\u00b10.05 mB per\nformula unit. The effective moment falls by 8% at room\ntemperature to 3.31 mB. For fully ordered NiMnSb, the pre-\ndicted Ms should be 4 mB. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measure-\nments for these samples, which are presented elsewhere,29\nindicate that about 1% of second phase NiSb is present in the\nsamples. The reduced saturation magnetization is likely\ncaused by a combination of the presence of the NiSb phase,\nthe off stoichiometry, and the presence of antisite defects.\nHowever, it is surprising that the saturation magnetization\nvalue is so similar for both samples when there are clear\ndifferences in XRD and EDX.\nMagnetic force microscopy (MFM) was used to provide\ninformation on the domain structure. As shown in Fig. 4, the\nMFM images of the as-grown Prf and polished Irf samples\nshow striped domain structures with domain periodicity of\nthe order of 1.7 and 4.3 mm, respectively. We anticipate dif-\nferences in the interface transparency when the supercon-\nducting coherence length is smaller or larger than the domain\nsize and consequently these are also important length scales\nin the PCAR fitting problem and should always be made\nexplicit. In our case the coherence length for bulk Nb is of\nthe order of tens of nanometers, and the domain size is of the\norder of microns.\nThe differential conductance spectra were normalized to\nthe conductance at high bias s15 mVd. These were then mod-\neled using the Mazin extension16 to the BTK theory for a\nS-I-N junction.30 There are four fitting parameters; the super-\nconductor energy gap sDd, the polarization sPtd, the dimen-\nsionless barrier parameter sZd, and a spectral smearing pa-\nrameter sGd. The number of fitting parameters were reduced\nby discarding data where D\u00de1.5 meV (the energy gap of\nNb).\nTo illustrate that PCAR can produce unique values of P\nand Z an iterative quality of fit procedure was carried out for\na Nb-NiMnSb and a Nb-Co contact which had low and high\nZ values, respectively. Figure 5 shows the value of Pt ob-\ntained for the Nb-NiMnSb contact and resulting goodness-\nof-fit as a function of Z. In this way an optimized set of Pt, Z,\nand G parameters were obtained for each conductance spec-\ntra. The quality of each fit is shown, with the best fit obtained\nfor Z=0.05, with an estimated error in Z of \u00b10.05. This cor-\nFIG. 3.

The errors in Pt deter-\nmined from fitting to conductance spectra with high Z values\nare larger. This is demonstrated by the fitting of a conduc-\ntance spectrum of a Nb-Co contact with a high Z, Fig. 6. In\nthis example it is clear that the best fit is obtained when Z\n=0.27 with an estimated error in Z of \u00b10.05. However as\nthere is a greater change in Pt with Z, the corresponding error\nin Pt is \u00b10.03. The spectral smearing parameter as obtained\nfrom the fitting procedure were consistent between samples\nand between measurements. Figure 7(b) shows the level of\nsmearing as a funtion of Z, and has a typical value of 1 meV.\nThis is noticeably larger than the expected value of\n0.36 meV for thermal smearing at 4.2 K [as shown by the\ndotted line in Fig. 7(b)]. This fact suggests that strong non-\nthermal broadening mechanisms are at play at the junction\ninterface, presumably associated with interface scattering.\nFigure 7(a) shows Pt versus Z for both samples with vari-\nous surface treatments. It is found that there is no discernable\ndifference in Pt for the two samples. Etching of the Prf ma-\nterial with HF did not change the value of Pt within the\nestimated error. The decay of Pt with increasing Z is seen in\nall reported PCAR measurements and is probably due to a\nsurface oxide. For both the Prf and Irf samples the polariza-\ntion is 0.44\u00b10.05 at Z=0.\nIV. DISCUSSION\nFrom the magnetization measurements of the bulk mate-\nrial we see that the effective moment is slightly below the\nvalue of 4 mB predicted for half-metallic NiMnSb.31 A small\npercentage of atomic disorder may reduce in the ferromag-\nnetic exchange coupling between the local magnetic mo-\nments of the Mn d-band and the conduction electrons11\nbringing Ms down. Furthermore electronic structure calcula-\ntions of disordered NiMnSb32 have shown that small levels\nof disorder can reduce the minority-spin band gap to zero.\nRecent theoretical analysis of surface reconstruction at the\nfree surface of NiMnSb estimates that P=0% for Ni termi-\nnated surface layers, and P=30% in the case of MnSb\ntermination.33 (Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy\nhas actually demonstrated the tendency for segregation of\nMn at the free surface of NiMnSb films,34 but this result may\nbe specific to films grown on certain substrates.) In the case\nof the samples studied here, the PCAR measurements were\nrather insensitive to surface preparation suggesting that it is\ndisorder into the bulk of the material rather than surface re-\nconstruction that is dominating our results. This observation\nis consistent with the depressed bulk saturation magnetiza-\ntion measurement which indeed ought to correlate with the\nmeasured polarization.\nV. CONCLUSION\nFrom this study it is clear that the two methods of pro-\nducing bulk NiMnSb described here have little effect on the\npolarization as measured by PCAR or the global magnetiza-\ntion. It would be desirable to improve the preparation of the\nmaterial to produce the predicted bulk magnetization of 4 mB\nper formula unit for half-metallic NiMnSb. Matching\nNiMnSb films to the tunnel barrier interface while preserving\nthe high spin polarizing properties of the charge carrier is the\nnext significant materials challenge.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThis work was supported by the EU Contract FENIKS:\nG5RD 2001 00535.\nFIG. 6.
