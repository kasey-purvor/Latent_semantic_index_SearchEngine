Relative youth, prox-\nimity, compactness and richness make it key to understanding stellar\nX-ray emission and its evolution. Cluster members cover spectral\ntypes from late B to late M, enabling the simultaneous study of the\ndifferent processes driving X-ray emission from stars of different\ninternal structure.\nSolar-like stars (spectral types \u2248 F5\u2013M3) have radiative cores\nand convective outer envelopes, and X-ray emission is believed to\nbe from hot plasma confined in magnetic loops in the corona, a\nstrong magnetic field being generated by a dynamo located at the\nbase of the convection zone (\u03b1\u0007 dynamo: Parker 1975), as on the\n\u0003E-mail: briggs@astro.phys.ethz.ch (KRB); pye@star.le.ac.uk (JPP)\nSun. Supportive correlations of increasing coronal X-ray and chro-\nmospheric line (e.g. H\u03b1, Ca II H, K) luminosities with increasing\nconvection zone depth and increasing rotation rates have been well-\nobserved (Pallavicini et al. 1981; Noyes, Weiss & Vaughan 1984;\nPizzolato et al. 2003), although the saturation of these \u2018magnetic\nactivity indicators\u2019 at high rotation rates, at an X-ray-to-bolometric\nluminosity ratio of LX\/Lbol \u2248 10\u22123 (Vilhu 1984), awaits a full ex-\nplanation. X-ray luminosities, LX, may exceed 103 times that of the\nSun at the peak of its activity cycle and younger stellar samples show\nhigher mean LX as rotation rates slow with time through the brak-\ning effect of a magnetized stellar wind. The youth of the Pleiades\nensures a number of \u2018ultrafast-rotating\u2019 solar-like members (UFRs),\nshowing saturated levels of magnetic activity, of which there are few\nexamples in the nearby field.\nThe X-ray-emitting corona of the Sun is highly variable and\nhighly structured. Stellar X-ray emission is also highly variable, ex-\nhibiting flares with profiles echoing those seen on the Sun, though\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS\n at Leicester U\nniversity Library on O\nctober 14, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nXMM\u2013Newton and the Pleiades 715\nreaching a peak LX of up to 103 times higher. X-ray telescopes can-\nnot resolve stellar coronae into active regions and individual loops\nas seen on the Sun, but loop sizes may be inferred from analysis of\nflare decays (Reale & Micela 1998). Loop lengths that are a large\nfraction of, but smaller than, the stellar radius have been derived\nfrom flares observed on a small number of nearby solar-like stars\n(e.g. Maggio et al. 2000; Covino et al. 2001; Gu\u00a8del et al. 2001).\nYounger, faster-rotating, samples show flares of higher peak LX and\nwith higher frequency (Stelzer, Neuha\u00a8user & Hambaryan 2000),\nhence the Pleiades is a good target for the study of stellar flares and\ncoronal structure.\nThe temperature structure and composition of some stellar coro-\nnae diverge from those of the solar corona. Therein, the bulk of\nX-ray-emitting plasma is at 1\u20132 MK (e.g. Orlando, Peres & Reale\n2000), though flaring plasma is often as hot as 10 MK (Reale, Peres\n& Orlando 2001), while faster-rotating stars have more plasma at\nhigher temperatures (e.g. Gu\u00a8del, Guinan & Skinner 1997), with the\nmost active stars having significant amounts of plasma at 20 MK\n(e.g. Mewe et al. 1996). Elemental abundances in the solar corona\ndiffer from those in its photosphere (so-called solar abundances),\nwith elements with low first ionization potential (FIP), such as Fe,\nappearing overabundant (Meyer 1985), although variability occurs\nwith location within the corona (McKenzie & Feldman 1992) and\nduring flares (Reames, Meyer & von Rosenvinge 1994). In the coro-\nnae of highly active solar-like stars, however, low-FIP elements ap-\npear underabundant (e.g. Singh et al. 1999), and the FIP dependence\nof coronal abundances changes according to activity level (Audard\n& Gu\u00a8del 2002). The proximity of the Pleiades enables the study\nof temperature structure and composition in coronae of a number\nof individual solar-like stars, helping to extend the relatively small\nsample of coronae in which these physical conditions have been\nmeasured.\nWhile solar-like stars have hot coronae and early-type (\u0002B3) stars\nare thought to generate X-rays via hot shocks within their massive\nstellar winds, stars of intermediate type (\u2248B4\u2013F4) lack both a deep\nconvective envelope and a massive stellar wind and are thus gener-\nally considered incapable of strong X-ray emission: any observed\nis conventionally attributed to a later-type companion with a hot\ncorona (e.g. Golub et al. 1983; Micela et al. 1996, 1999), although in\nmost cases such a companion remains undiscovered. Intermediate-\ntype Pleiads, relatively close and well studied for binarity, provide\na good sample in which to test this assertion.\nThe X-ray emission from low-mass stars (spectral types \u0001M3),\nwhich are thought to be fully convective and hence unable to support\nan \u03b1\u0007 dynamo, is examined in a companion paper (Briggs & Pye\n2003).\nThe core of the Pleiades has been extensively surveyed at X-ray\nwavelengths by the Einstein (Caillault & Helfand 1985; Micela et al.\n1990) and ROSAT (Stauffer et al. 1994; Micela et al. 1996, 1999;\nStelzer & Neuha\u00a8user 2001) observatories, and a single field therein\nhas been observed twice by Chandra (Krishnamurthi et al. 2001;\nDaniel, Linsky & Gagne\u00b4 2002, henceforth DLG02).\nThe ROSAT surveys detected X-ray emission, attributed to the\ncoronae of late-type companions, from \u2248 one-third of intermediate-\ntype stars (Stauffer et al. 1994; Micela et al. 1996). Krishnamurthi\net al. (2001) judged the soft, bright X-ray emission of four\nintermediate-type stars in the Chandra field to be intrinsic to these\nstars, but their known binarity led DLG02 to implicate solar-like\nsecondaries.\nThe ROSAT surveys indicated X-rays were emitted by practically\nall solar-like Pleiads. Gagne\u00b4, Caillault & Stauffer (1995, henceforth\nGCS95) analysed the individual spectra of X-ray-bright Pleiads\n(log LX \u0001 30.0) and the composite spectra of samples subdivided\nby spectral type (F, G, K, M) and into slow (v sin i < 16 km s\u22121)\nand fast (v sin i > 16 km s\u22121) rotators. Only among G stars did\nthe rotation rate seem to cause significant spectral differences, but\nthere was a rising sequence in temperature from F to slowly rotat-\ning G then K and M to fast-rotating G. GCS95 did not investigate\ncoronal abundances due to the low energy resolution of the PSPC,\nbut DLG02 found evidence for low Fe abundance in the coronae of\nthree K stars.\nFlares identified in the ROSAT surveys showed LX increases of\nfactors of 2\u201340, peak log LX of 29.8\u201331.2 and decay time-scales\nof 1\u201313 ks, and were more frequent on K and M stars than on G\nstars, which have lower mean LX\/Lbol (GCS95; Stelzer et al. 2000).\nGCS95 inferred a loop half-length of L \u0001 6R\u0003 (stellar radii), for\na large flare on the K star H II 1516 using a quasi-static cooling\nloop model, but this model is not self-consistent in its assumptions\nand overestimates the loop length (Reale 2002), the energy range of\nthe PSPC was insufficient to constrain the peak temperature and the\nlight curve was sparsely sampled.\nIn comparison with ROSAT , the greater sensitivity, wider en-\nergy range, better energy resolution and continuous time coverage\nof the EPIC detectors onboard XMM\u2013Newton enable spectral stud-\nies at higher resolution of Pleiades members with lower X-ray lu-\nminosities, the detection of smaller flares, and better-constrained\nmodelling of large flares. We use the XMM\u2013Newton EPIC cam-\neras to perform spectral and timing analyses of stars of spectral\ntypes B\u2013K in a single 15-arcmin radius field in the core of the\nPleiades, with the aims: (i) to estimate the temperature structure\nand the metallicity and, through analysis of the decays of large\nflares, the loop size in the coronae of individual solar-like Pleiads\nand hence to compare these properties with those of well-studied\ncoronae of nearby solar-like stars and (ii) to see whether X-ray\nemission from intermediate-type stars is consistent with emission\nfrom the coronae of later-type companions. DLG02 addressed sim-\nilar questions using their 60-ks Chandra study of a neighbour-\ning field. While the better angular resolution of Chandra offered\nlower background count-rates, our XMM\u2013Newton observation adds\nto this study by sampling a more complete range of spectral types,\nproviding more counts per source to enable better-constrained\nspectral modelling, expanding the sample of well-studied X-ray-\ndetected intermediate-type Pleiads and being able to analyse large\nflares.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the mem-\nbership, optical and physical data on the Pleiades used in this\nwork; Section 3 details the X-ray observations and data analysis\nperformed; Section 4 reports and discusses our results; Section 5\nsummarizes the work.\n2 P L E I A D E S M E M B E R S H I P\nA N D P H Y S I C A L PA R A M E T E R S\nWe have drawn a list of solar-like and intermediate-type Pleiades\nmembers from the catalogue of Belikov et al.

The metallicity of the cluster\nis near-solar (e.g. King et al. 2000).

All eight solar-like stars (F\u2013K)\nand three of the five intermediate-type stars (B\u2013A) were clear by-\neye detections. We henceforth refer to these 11 stars collectively as\n\u2018X-ray-bright Pleiads\u2019. The SAS source-detection software was run\non images from the individual cameras, finding the best-fitting X-ray\nposition to be within 3.5 arcsec of the optical position (USNO-A2.0:\nMonet et al. 1998) for each X-ray-bright Pleiad, and finding the\nremaining two intermediate-type Pleiads, H II 1028 and 1431, to be\nundetected at a maximum-likelihood threshold of ML > 12. Upper\nlimits (at the 95 per cent confidence level) to their X-ray luminosities\nwere estimated from the counts in the 0.3\u20134.5 keV band within 16\narcsec of the optical position (using the \u2018classical\u2019 prescription of\nKraft, Burrows & Nousek 1991 and the algebraic approximations to\nthe Poissonian upper limit derived by Gehrels 1986) by correcting\nfor enclosed energy and effective exposure time, and assuming a\n0.8-keV MEKAL source spectrum and a distance of 127 pc.\nWe performed spectral and timing analyses of the X-ray-bright\nPleiads using primarily data from the pn, as its higher sensitivity and\nlonger exposure time collected typically a factor of 3\u20134 more counts\nper source than a single MOS. MOS data were used where they pro-\nvided\u0001500 source counts and were not affected by CCD edges (H II\n1384, 1762). For each X-ray-bright Pleiad, we extracted a spectrum\nand light curve from a circular region centred on the best-fitting\nX-ray source position. The radius of this circle, r, ranged from 30 to\n60 arcsec and was constrained by two concerns: (i) contamination\nby neighbouring sources and (ii) retention of a good signal-to-noise\nratio. The former provided the stronger constraint in most cases.\nIn each case, a background spectrum and light curve were also ex-\ntracted from a surrounding annulus, with inner radius \u00031.5r and\narea \u00015 times the source extraction area after areas contaminated\nby other sources had been removed. The number of background\ncounts, B, expected to fall within each source extraction region was\nestimated from background maps produced by the source detection\nprocedure and each background product was scaled to contribute\nB counts to its associated source product. Analysis of the source\nproducts is described below.\n3.1 Time series analysis\nSource and background light curves were extracted (from regions\ndescribed above) in the 0.3\u20134.5 keV band and binned to ensure\nan average of >20 net source counts per bin, to enable good ap-\nproximation of the error on the total counts in each bin, N, as\u221a\nN . Background-subtracted source light curves are displayed in\nFig. 3.\nWe visually identified flare-like behaviour, defined as an isolated\nevent of heightened emission peaking at a factor of >2 above the\nmean \u2018quasi-steady\u2019 level outside that event. The decay time-scale of\neach flare was estimated by fitting an exponential decay to the light\ncurve, fixing the time of peak emission to the bin containing the peak\nnumber of counts. The peak and quasi-steady count-rates and the\ne-folding decay time-scale were fitted as free parameters. General\nvariability was assessed by applying a \u03c72 test against constancy to\nthe background-subtracted source light curve. While the \u03c72 test is\nflawed in that its result depends on the binning of data, we feel it\nis more robust than the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov (K\u2013S) test, which is\napplied to unbinned timing data but is not strictly applicable in the\npresence of a significant varying background, which is the case here.\nFlare parameters and results of the \u03c7 2 test are given in Table 2.\n3.2 Spectral analysis\nIn the extraction of spectra of variable sources, periods affected by\nclear flares (e.g. H II 1516) or non-flare-like high emission (e.g. H II\n1234) were excluded to enable analysis of \u2018quasi-steady\u2019 emission,\ni.e. not strongly biased by a single transient event. Where sufficient\ncounts were available, spectra from these periods were analysed\nseparately. For each spectrum, an ancillary response file (ARF) was\ngenerated to account for bad pixels and chip gaps, the spatial varia-\ntions of effective area and quantum efficiency, vignetting and losses\ndue to the finite source extraction area. Finally, each source spec-\ntrum was grouped to a minimum of 20 counts per bin. All data bins\ncontaining fewer than 20 counts, and all data outside the range 0.3\u2013\n4.5 keV, were ignored in spectral analysis. The latest (as of 2002\nOctober) pn and MOS redistribution matrices were used, with the\nARFs, to model the instrumental responses.\nThe X-ray emission of a stellar corona is due to hot, optically thin\nplasma and the spectrum is expected to be a superposition of the\nspectra of many individual loops of hot plasma at different temper-\natures. Hence, the form of the differential emission measure (DEM)\nas a function of temperature may be rather complex. Additionally,\nelemental abundances in coronae may differ from solar abundances.\nHowever, the relatively low energy resolution (\u224870 eV) provided\nby EPIC, and signal-to-noise ratio typical of bright coronae at the\ndistance of the Pleiades, require us to approximate the DEM to one\n(1-T) or two (2-T) discrete temperature components, and estimate\nabundances using a metallicity parameter, Z, in which the abun-\ndances of individual metals are fixed to the ratios observed in the\nsolar photosphere but the total abundance of metals relative to that\nof H may be fixed to the solar value (Z\f) or fitted freely (Z free).\nThe MEKAL plasma emission code was used, and the absorbing col-\numn density was fixed to the nominal value for the Pleiades (see\nSection 2) of N H = 2 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122, as exclusion of data below 0.3\nkeV prevents constraint of N H at such low values.\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS, MNRAS 345, 714\u2013726\n at Leicester U\nniversity Library on O\nctober 14, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n718 K.

The two spectral components have approximately equal\nemission measures, and although that of the hotter component is\nthe lower for the two slowly rotating stars, H II 1348 and 1110, it\nis not significantly so. Fits to the better-quality spectra (>900 net\nsource counts; H II 1100, 1348 and 1516 \u2013 cf. <500 counts for H II\n1110 and 1280) were significantly improved by allowing non-solar\nmetallicity in the 2-T model, with Z \u223c 0.2 Z\f. DLG02 also found\nevidence for low Fe abundances in the spectra of two K stars in the\nChandra sample, and subsolar coronal metal abundances appear to\nbe a consistent feature of nearby active K stars (AB Dor: Mewe\net al. 1996; \u2018Speedy\u2019 Mic: Singh et al. 1999; LQ Hya: Covino et al.\n2001).\n4.1.2 H II 1032 (G8 V)\nH II 1032 exhibited saturated-level X-ray emission, log LX \u2248 30.1\nand log(LX\/Lbol) \u2248 \u22123.1, consistent with its rotation period of 1.33\nd. The quasi-steady spectrum required a 2-T Z free model with kT1 \u2248\n0.6 and kT2 \u2248 1.3 keV with a ratio of hotter:cooler emission mea-\nsures of EM2\/EM1 \u223c 1.5 and metallicity Z \u223c 0.3 Z\f. A ROSAT\nPSPC spectrum of H II 1032 was best-fitted using temperatures of\n0.4 and 1.2 keV, with fixed solar metallicity (GCS95). Comparable\nbest-fitting temperatures were found for a composite PSPC spectrum\nof fast-rotating G-type Pleiads, and an individual spectrum of the\nfast-rotating G star H II 320 (GCS95; Fig. 5). In mass and saturated-\nlevel X-ray emission, H II 1032 resembles the nearby, faster-rotating\n(P rot = 0.514 d) K0\u20131 star AB Dor, but while the quasi-steady\nspectrum of AB Dor also shows a component at 0.6 keV, it has a\nprominent hot component at 1.9 keV absent on H II 1032 (Mewe\net al. 1996; Maggio et al. 2000; Gu\u00a8del et al. 2001). The sample of\nwell-studied solar-like UFRs is too small for the effect of saturation\non coronal properties such as temperature, to be well-investigated\nso additions to this sample are important to our understanding of ac-\ntivity saturation. While no companion to H II 1032 has been reported\n(e.g. Bouvier et al. 1997), Fig. 2 suggests photometric binarity, so\nits X-ray emission may arise from the unsaturated coronae of two\nor more active stars.\n4.1.3 H II 1514 (G5 V)\nH II 1514 showed log LX \u2248 29.3, consistent with its rotation period\nof 3.33 d. Its spectrum was acceptably fitted with a 1-T Z free model\nwith kT \u2248 0.55 keV and Z \u223c 0.3 Z\f. A second temperature was\nnot constrained, but a significant component at kT < 0.2 keV could\nnot be discounted. Hotter temperatures best-fitted both a composite\nROSAT PSPC spectrum of slowly rotating G stars (kT1 \u2248 0.23, kT2\n\u2248 0.92 keV), and individual spectra of two reportedly slow-rotating\nG stars, H II 739 and 761 (GCS95), though the LX of these stars\n(>1030 erg s\u22121) indicates fast rotation akin to the nearby solar-\nanalogue EK Dra (Gu\u00a8del et al. 1997). The slower-rotating (P rot \u2248\n5 d), nearby G1 stars \u03c0 1 UMa and \u03c7 1 Ori do show similar LX and\ntemperatures to H II 1514.\n4.1.4 H II 1309 (F6 V)\nH II 1309 gave log LX \u2248 29.4 and a relatively soft X-ray spectrum,\nakin to that of H II 1514, acceptably fitted with a 1-T, Z\f model\nwith kT \u2248 0.56 keV, although low metallicity, Z \u223c 0.5 Z\f offered\nsignificant improvement. As for H II 1514, a significant cool (kT <\n0.2 keV) component could not be ruled out. Similar temperatures\n(kT1 < 0.2, 0.4 < kT2 < 0.7: mean 0.54 keV) and log LX (28.5\u201329.5:\nmean 29.2) were found for a sample of field F stars (Panzera et al.\n1999), although a composite spectrum of F-type Pleiads required a\nhotter temperature of kT2 \u2248 0.69 keV (GCS95). The rotation period\nof H II 1309 of \u00020.74 d may suggest saturated-level activity. In\nlate-F stars, saturation appears to set in at lower LX\/Lbol (\u223c10\u22124)\nand perhaps shorter rotation periods than in G stars (Pizzolato et al.\n2003).\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS, MNRAS 345, 714\u2013726\n at Leicester U\nniversity Library on O\nctober 14, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n720 K.

A comparison of coronal temperatures, using 2-T models, of\nPleiads and nearby solar-like field stars. Filled black circles mark Pleiads in\nthe EPIC FOV (Table 3); filled grey circles mark other individual Pleiads\nand field stars: the circle size represents the source LX, and the H II num-\nber or source name, and (spectral type) are given. Open ellipses show (i)\napproximate 90 per cent confidence regions for Pleiades samples divided\nby spectral type and rotation rate; (ii) approximate limits for a sample of\nfield F stars. Note the sequence in increasing temperature from F and slowly\nrotating G through K to fast-rotating G stars. The sources associated with the\nintermediate-type Pleiads 1762, 1384 and 1234 have LX, kT1, kT2 consistent\nwith those of solar-like stars.\nusing ROSAT (Panzera et al. 1999), and nearby solar analogues,\nusing ROSAT and ASCA (Gu\u00a8del et al. 1997, 1998), although none\nof our Pleiades sample has a significant component as hot as 2 keV\nas do 47 Cas and AB Dor (see Fig. 5).\nWe also found a requirement or significant preference for subpho-\ntospheric metallicities in the quasi-steady spectra of all solar-like\nPleiads providing >500 source counts: Z \u223c 0.2 Z\f for K stars,\n\u223c0.3 Z\f for G stars and \u223c0.5 Z\f for the F star. The fitted metal-\nlicity, Z, is typically driven by the abundance of Fe, which has\nstrong emission lines in the EPIC energy range. High-resolution\nX-ray spectroscopy of nearby solar-like stars has found coronal ele-\nmental abundances to depend on FIP in a manner that changes with\nLX\/Lbol or coronal temperature (Audard & Gu\u00a8del 2002). In highly\nactive stars, such as AB Dor, low-FIP elements such as Fe appear un-\nderabundant, while in intermediate-activity stars, such as \u03c0 1 UMa\nor \u03c7 1 Ori, there is no FIP bias, and in low-activity stars, such as\nthe Sun, low-FIP elements appear overabundant (Meyer 1985). The\nlow values of Z we find in the coronae of the active G- and K-type\nPleiads H II 1032, 1100 and 1516 appear to fit into this framework,\nbut the similarly low Z of the intermediate-activity H II 1514 does\nnot. Coronal abundances are entangled with the emission measure\ndistribution in spectra of this quality, and are much better studied\nwith instruments that can resolve individual lines and measure rel-\native abundances of different elements, not just a global metallicity\nparameter. Overall our results indicate that the temperature struc-\nture and abundances in the quasi-steady coronae of solar-like Pleiads\nconform to expectations from well-studied nearby active stars.\n4.2 Variability and flaring on solar-like stars\nAll five K stars exhibited variability at the 90 per cent confidence\nlevel \u2013 only in H II 1348 was the light curve consistent with constant\nemission with probability >0.05 \u2013 and H II 1100, 1516 and 1280\ndisplayed flare-like events (Figs 3f, h and i). All three flares had\ndecay time-scales, \u03c4LC, of \u223c3 ks. The H II 1100 flare outshone the\nrest of its corona five times over, while the peak LX of the flares on\nH II 1516 and 1280 just exceeded those of their respective quasi-\nsteady coronae. The light curve of H II 1100 shows a striking dip near\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS, MNRAS 345, 714\u2013726\n at Leicester U\nniversity Library on O\nctober 14, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n722 K.

The ellipse shows the approximate 1\u03c3 confidence interval for\nparameters derived from the flare-peak spectrum.\nthe onset of the large flare that is discussed further in Section 4.2.2.\nH II 1032 exhibited a flare (Fig. 3b), with peak LX a factor of \u22483\nhigher than the quasi-steady LX, and \u03c4LC \u2248 2 ks, while the light\ncurves of H II 1309 and 1514 displayed no formal variability (Figs 3d\nand e). The four flaring stars had higher quasi-steady log(LX\/Lbol)\nvalues than the four non-flaring stars (see Table 3). The results follow\nthe observed trend for more variability, and more frequent and larger\nflares in the coronae of more active stars (Stelzer et al. 2000).\n4.2.1 Loop modelling from flare decays\nThe solar corona is highly structured with hot, X-ray-emitting\nplasma largely confined to magnetic loops that may span up to a\nthird of the solar diameter (e.g. Reale et al. 1997). Although stellar\ncoronae are not spatially resolved by present instrumentation, it has\nbeen shown that the sizes of magnetic loops involved in flares may be\ninferred from an analysis of the flare decay (van den Oord & Mewe\n1989; Serio et al. 1991). Such techniques have typically neglected\nthe presence of sustained heating in the decay and yielded loop half-\nlengths L > R\u0003 in stellar flares (e.g. GCS95). Reale et al. (1997)\nhave performed detailed hydrodynamic modelling of the decay of\nflaring loops to develop an empirical method that diagnoses and\naccounts for continued heating in the estimation of loop sizes. The\ntechnique has been successfully tested on resolved solar flares and\napplied to stellar flares using a number of different X-ray detectors\n(including EPIC pn), yielding L < R\u0003 (e.g. Reale & Micela 1998;\nFavata & Schmitt 1999; Maggio et al. 2000; Gu\u00a8del et al. 2001). The\npresence of sustained heating is diagnosed through the evolution of\ntemperature, T , and density, n, in the flare decay, specifically the\nshallower the slope, \u03b6 , in the log T \u2013log n diagram, the slower the\ndecay time-scale of the flare heating rate (maximum \u03b6 \u2248 1.9 for no\ncontinued heating; EPIC pn). For stellar flares n can rarely be di-\nrectly measured so the emission measure, E M = \u222b nenH dV \u221d n2,\nis used to obtain \u03b6 from a log T \u2013 log\n\u221a\nE M diagram. L is then in-\nferred from \u03b6 , the light-curve decay time, \u03c4LC, and the maximum\ntemperature in the loop at flare peak, T max, as in equations (4) and\n(5) in Favata et al. (2000), where cA = 11.6, \u03b6 A = 0.56, qA = 1.2\nfor EPIC pn (Reale, private communication).\nThe flares on H II 1032 and 1100 allow us to apply a modified\nversion of the hydrodynamic technique to estimate the size of loop\ninvolved. For each flare, a spectrum of the flare \u2018peak\u2019 (displayed in\ngrey in Figs 4b and f) was extracted and fitted with a single MEKAL\ncomponent with Z fixed to the best-fitting quasi-steady value, in ad-\ndition to the best-fitting quasi-steady model (from Table 3). The fit-\nted temperatures (with 1\u03c3 confidence intervals) and emission mea-\nsures of the plasma at flare peak were 23.5 (20\u201327) MK and 3.4 \u00d7\n1053 cm\u22123 for H II 1032, and 15.4 (14\u201317) MK and 1.4 \u00d7 1053 cm\u22123\nfor H II 1100, from which we derived respective T max values of 39.2\n(32\u201346) and 24.3 (22\u201327) MK using the relation (Reale, private\ncommunication):\nTmax = 0.184 T 1.13obs (for EPIC pn).\nWe constructed a log T \u2013 log\n\u221a\nE M diagram by estimating the flare\ntemperature from a hardness ratio (HR = (B \u2212 A)\/(A + B), where\nA and B are the count-rates above the mean quasi-steady count\nrate in the 0.3\u20131.0 and 1.0\u20134.5 keV bands, respectively: Fig. 6),\nand then the emission measure for that temperature from the to-\ntal count rate A + B. Conversions were calculated using the pn\nresponse appropriate for the particular star (Section 3.2) and 1-T\nMEKAL emission models with Z fixed to the best-fitting quasi-steady\nvalue. The count-rates were not sufficient to constrain \u03b6 well: \u03b6 1032 =\n1.6 (0.45\u20132.3) (Fig. 7); \u03b6 1100 = 1.0 (<1.6). Although in the H II 1032\nflare \u03b6 is consistent with the absence of sustained heating, its pres-\nence cannot be ruled out, and it is apparently required in the case\nof H II 1100. If \u03b6 < 0.4, the observed decay is controlled by the\nheating decay time-scale, not the thermodynamic time-scale, and\nis hence independent of L, which can be constrained only by an\nupper limit: this is the case for H II 1100. To estimate the lower\nand upper bounds of a 1\u03c3 confidence interval for L we have first\ncalculated the lower and upper bounds for the quantityLF(\u03b6 ) using\nthe 1\u03c3 uncertainties on T max and \u03c4LC, secondly added in quadrature\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS, MNRAS 345, 714\u2013726\n at Leicester U\nniversity Library on O\nctober 14, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nXMM\u2013Newton and the Pleiades 723\na 20 per cent uncertainty that derives from consistency checks on\nsolar flares, and finally used the lower and upper bounds of \u03b6 to\nobtain upper and lower bounds, respectively, to F(\u03b6 ).

Assuming\na loop aspect ratio of 0.2, the mean electron densities in the loop\nat flare peak, n, were n1032 \u223c 5 (2.7\u201345) and n1100 \u223c 5 (>2) \u00d7\n1011 cm\u22123. The corresponding pressures, p, calculated from the\nequation of state, were p1032 \u223c 5 (2.5\u201360) and p1100 \u223c 4 (>1) \u00d7\n103 dyne cm\u22122, requiring magnetic field strengths, B, of B1032 \u223c\n400 (250\u20131200) and B1100 \u223c 300 (>170) G for confinement. These\nvalues are fairly typical of a variety of larger flares on the nearby\nyoung K-type stars AB Dor (L in the range 2.5\u20134.9 \u00d7 1010 cm:\nOrtolani et al. 1998; Maggio et al. 2000; Gu\u00a8del et al. 2001), and\nLQ Hya (L \u2248 8.3 \u00d7 1010 cm: Covino et al. 2001), which have been\nanalysed using the hydrodynamic method.\nWe caution that TRACE images of large solar flares reveal struc-\nture far more complex than single loops (e.g. see the review by\nAschwanden, Poland & Rabin 2001), and so stellar flares, often\n102\u22123 times more powerful than the strongest solar flares, may not\nbe well-modelled as single loops.\n4.2.2 An eclipse of the flare on H II 1100?\nThe light curve of H II 1100 displays a striking dip at 24\u201325.5 ks\nafter the start of the pn exposure when the count rate drops sharply\nfrom \u2248120 count ks\u22121 to the quasi-steady rate of \u224840 count ks\u22121 in\n\u03c4 fall \u2248 300 s, remains at this value for \u03c4min \u2248 600 s, and then rises\nsharply to \u2248200 count ks\u22121 in \u03c4 rise \u2248 500 s (Fig. 3f). The feature\nis not of instrumental origin as it is reproduced in the MOS light\ncurves, the background on that CCD shows no similar feature and\nno periods of data loss at this time were recorded.\nThe profile of the dip is suggestive of a total eclipse of a slow-\nrising flare, and the most interesting possibility is that this is caused\nby an object orbiting the flaring star. Approximating the flare geom-\netry to the simplest case of a uniform circular source, and assuming\na near-central eclipse, the ratio of radii of eclipsing object, Rb, and\nflare, Rfl, is\nRb\/Rfl = 1 + \u03c4min\/\u03c4fall \u2248 3\nwhile Rb = (\u03c4 fall + \u03c4min)v\/2, where v is the orbital velocity of\nthe eclipsing object. Substituting for v using Kepler\u2019s third law, the\nproduct of the circular orbital distance, ab, and R2b is\nab R2b = (\u03c4fall + \u03c4min)2G M\u0003(1 + Mb\/M\u0003)\/4 \u2248 22,\nwhere ab and Rb are measured in 1010 cm and M\u0003 = 0.8 M\f \u000e Mb.\nThe loop half-length, L = \u03c0Rfl\/2 \u223c 1.2 \u00d7 1010 cm, inferred from\nthe flare decay suggests Rb \u223c 2.3 \u00d7 1010 cm, and, unacceptably, ab\n\u223c 4 \u00d7 1010 cm, <R\u0003, although the geometry of the loop and its incli-\nnation may cause Rb\/Rfl < 3, and a smaller loop size was allowed\nby the flare-decay analysis. A Jupiter-sized object (Rb = RJ \u2248 0.7 \u00d7\n1010 cm) must orbit at a distance of \u223c0.03 au to cause the eclipse,\nand would imply a flare-loop half-length of L \u223c 0.4 \u00d7 1010 cm, the\nflare decay hence being controlled by the heating decay time-scale,\nindependent of the loop size. A number of such \u2018hot Jupiters\u2019 have\nbeen detected around nearby solar-like stars (e.g. 51 Peg b: Mayor\n& Queloz 1995; \u03c4 Boo\u00a8 b: Butler et al. 1997). Although H II 1100 is a\nbinary system, the projected separation of the near-twin components\nof 100 au (Bouvier et al. 1997) is too large to affect the orbit of such\na planet. The existence of such a planet could be demonstrated by\noptical observations. Its transit across the stellar disc should eclipse\na fraction (0.7\/5.0)2 = 0.02 of the disc area, causing a dimming\nof 0.02 mag. Given the above orbit, this dimming should last \u223c3\nks and occur every \u223c2 d. The gravitational influence of the planet\nshould also cause a small periodic radial velocity perturbation of\n0.2Mb sin i\/M J km s\u22121, although the apparent magnitude of V =\n12.16 for H II 1100 makes such measurements extremely difficult.\nIf a planet were to be confirmed, this would be the first planet de-\ntected by its eclipse of an X-ray flare, the first planet discovered\nin the Pleiades, and only the second planet discovered by a transit\nmethod. However, one must conclude that even if such a planet was\nto exist, its total eclipse of a flaring loop would be a highly fortuitous\nevent.\nAn alternative possibility is that the flare was obscured by cool\nmaterial passing across the line of sight, as proposed by Haisch et al.\n(1983) to explain the observation by Einstein of a temporarily in-\ncreased N H for a time interval during a flare on the dMe star Proxima\nCentauri. If we model the flare plasma using the best-fitting spec-\ntral model of the flare peak (Section 4.2.1), an absorbing column of\nN H > 1022 cm2 is required to absorb >75 per cent of the 0.3\u2013\n4.5 keV photons, as is observed. This is two orders of magni-\ntude greater than has been seen in solar prominences, the Proxima\nCentauri event, or cool clouds in the atmosphere of AB Dor that\nhave been inferred from transient H\u03b1 absorption profiles (Collier\nCameron et al. 1990). While the size of the AB Dor clouds (area\n\u223c1021 cm2) is comparable to that required by our eclipse profile,\ntheir velocities, held to the rotation of the star at around the corota-\ntion radius, \u223c200\u2013300 km s\u22121, are not analogous to the velocity of\n\u223c150\u2013500 km s\u22121 required of our obscuring cloud, as v sin i is only\n5 km s\u22121 for H II 1100. While such high velocities are fairly com-\nmon in erupting prominences on the Sun (e.g. Gopalswamy et al.\n2003), and the bulk kinetic energy of the cloud is around the same\norder of magnitude as (0.05\u20135 times) the total energy, \u223c6 \u00d7 1033\nerg, radiated by the flare with which it is presumably associated, it\nwould be puzzling if such a flare, which is a routine twice-a-day\noccurrence on AB Dor, was associated with such an extraordinarily\ndenser cloud.\nA third explanation is that the large flare, with an impulsive, short\nrise-time, is shortly preceded by a smaller flare (albeit, with peak\nLX \u2248 1030 erg s\u22121, still larger than the flares exhibited by H II 1516\nand 1280) with a shorter decay time than rise time. Evidence for a\nfurther flare-like event occurring during the flare decay, at \u224827.8\nks (see Fig. 3f) supports the idea of multiple flaring within a com-\nplex active region. If we apply the hydrodynamic model with T max\n\u223c 25 MK, the fast decay, \u03c4 fall \u223c 300 s, indicates a loop structure,\nL \u0002 109 cm \u00020.02R\u0003, smaller than that of the larger flare that\nfollowed, though similar to that inferred from a flare with peak LX\n\u2248 4 \u00d7 1029 erg s\u22121, observed on a component of the dMe binary\nYY Gem (Stelzer et al. 2002). Flares with a longer rise than decay\ntime do not form a well-recognized class on the Sun, but they have\nbeen occasionally observed on other stars (e.g. the dMe star EQ\nPeg: Pallavicini, Tagliaferri & Stella 1990; several examples in the\nPleiades and Hyades noted by Stelzer et al. 2000). The coincidence\nof two flares \u2013 the first unusual, the second impulsive \u2013 in such a\nway as to mimic an eclipse forms a somewhat ad hoc explanation\nof the feature, but none of the available hypotheses presents a con-\nvincing explanation on the grounds of probability and\/or precedent.\nA planetary eclipse is the most interesting possibility and the only\none that may be confirmed or refuted by further observations.\n4.3 Emission from intermediate-type stars?\nIntermediate-type stars (\u2248B4\u2013F4) are believed to lack both the mas-\nsive stellar wind and deep convective envelope intrinsic to the X-ray\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS, MNRAS 345, 714\u2013726\n at Leicester U\nniversity Library on O\nctober 14, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n724 K.

Indeed, most X-ray surveys of A-type stars in the field and in\nopen clusters have found a paucity of detections (e.g. Schmitt et al.\n1985; Micela et al. 1990; Schmitt et al. 1990). The LX of detected\nstars appears to be uncorrelated with stellar properties influential in\nthe emission mechanisms of early-type or solar-like stars, such as\nLbol, or rotation (Simon, Drake & Kim 1995; Panzera et al. 1999).\nHowever, chromospheric emission has been reported to show a cor-\nrelation with rotation rate for stars with spectral types as early as\nA9 (Schrijver 1993), and emission lines of C III and O VI in \u03c4 3 Eri\nindicate material at temperatures in excess of 0.3 MK is possible in\nthe atmospheres of stars as early as A4 (Simon et al. 2002). In the\nHyades, a sharp fall in chromospheric emission is observed to occur\nat spectral type F5, which coincides with a sharp fall in rotation ve-\nlocity (Bo\u00a8hm-Vitense et al. 2002). It is possible that dynamo-driven\ncoronal X-ray emission extends to spectral types with some sub-\nclasses earlier than F5. 95 per cent of all F-type stars within 13 pc of\nthe Sun were detected by ROSAT (Schmitt 1997), although only an\nF2 subgiant and an unresolved pair of F0 V stars were earlier than\nF5. \u03b1 Aqu (Altair) and \u03b1 Cep were the only assuredly single A stars\nin the solar neighbourhood to be detected; both are fast-rotating, A7\nstars with very cool, low-luminosity, coronae (v sin i > 210 km s\u22121,\nkT \u2248 0.1 keV, LX \u2248 2 \u00d7 1027erg s\u22121: Simon et al. 1995). However,\ndetected intermediate-type stars have usually had hotter tempera-\ntures and LX of factors up to 102\u22123 higher; similar to the most active\nsolar-like stars. Hence, such detections have been conventionally at-\ntributed to coronal emission from late-type companions (e.g. Golub\net al. 1983; Caillault & Zoonematkermani 1989; Caillault, Gagne\u00b4\n& Stauffer 1994; Micela et al. 1996). In some cases further inves-\ntigation has uncovered an active late-type companion (Gu\u00a8del et al.\n1998; Simon & Ayres 2000), but often no further evidence for an\nappropriate partner exists, and in ROSAT HRI studies of resolved\nlate-B + late-type (Lindroos) binary systems, the B-type component\nwas found to be the brighter X-ray source in many cases (Bergho\u00a8fer\n& Schmitt 1994). However, one cannot rule out the existence of fur-\nther late-type companions closer still to the primary, and hardness\nratios of these X-ray-bright B-type stars are consistent with those\nof late-type coronae (Hue\u00b4lamo et al. 2000).\nThree of the five intermediate-type stars in our observation were\ndetected. We consider available optical and binarity information\nfor these stars, in addition to our own X-ray spectral and timing\ndata (Table 4), to test for consistency with a late-type companion.\nWhere a companion is known, we have inferred an approximate\nspectral type from the estimated masses of Raboud & Mermilliod\n(1998).\n4.3.1 H II 1762 (A9 V)\nH II 1762 was close to the edge of the EPIC FOV and so only\nobserved by MOS1. Its light curve showed no significant variability.\nIts X-ray spectrum was best-fitted by a 1-T Z\f model with kT \u2248\n0.64 keV and log LX \u2248 29.6: both somewhat higher than found for\nH II 1514 and 1309. H II 1762 has a known spectroscopic and visually\nseparated companion of estimated spectral type G\u2013K: a G star more\nactive than H II 1514 is a viable source of the X-ray emission.\n4.3.2 H II 1384 (A4 V)\nH II 1384 is one of the brightest X-ray sources in the Pleiades with\nlog LX \u2248 30.1 reported in Einstein, ROSAT and XMM\u2013Newton ob-\nservations. A flare with peak log LX of 30.5 and decay time of \u22481.2\nks was noted by Stelzer et al. (2000).\nH II 1384 fell on the very edge of a pn CCD, which may have\ncaused the variability not observed in the MOS light curves. Analy-\nses of spectra from the pn, and from MOS1, and simultaneous fitting\nof the two MOS spectra were in good agreement, but the MOS2\nspectrum required a hotter second component. A Z free model was\nrequired to give an acceptable fit and the addition of a second com-\nponent gave significant improvement. The spectral parametrization:\nkT1 \u2248 0.5, kT2 \u2248 1.0 keV, with EM2\/EM1 \u223c 0.8, and Z \u223c 0.25\nZ\f, is similar to that of coronae on fast-rotating G stars (Fig. 5),\nalthough no companion to H II 1384 has been found. Radial velocity\nvariations of \u223c35 km s\u22121 reported by Abt et al. (1965) have been\ndoubted (Simon et al. 1995; Raboud & Mermilliod 1998), and more\nrecent studies, albeit based on just two measurements each, found no\nevidence for variations indicative of a close companion (Liu, Janes\n& Bania 1991; Morse, Mathieu & Levine 1991). Speckle interfer-\nometry revealed no companion at angular separations of 0.035\u2013\n1 arcsec unless it is >3 mag fainter than the V = 7.66 primary\n(Mason et al. 1993), so a late-G star could have escaped de-\ntection. Fig. 2 does suggest photometric binarity. The apparently\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS, MNRAS 345, 714\u2013726\n at Leicester U\nniversity Library on O\nctober 14, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nXMM\u2013Newton and the Pleiades 725\nextraordinary X-ray emission of H II 1384 could be explained by a\nhighly active G-type companion, just like those discovered to ac-\ncompany 47 Cas (Gu\u00a8del et al. 1998) and the Hyad 71 Tau (Simon &\nAyres 2000), two F0 stars with apparent LX of 2 \u00d7 1030erg s\u22121. A\ndedicated radial velocity study of the star could test this hypothesis.\n4.3.3 H II 1028 (A2 V)\nH II 1028 showed no X-ray emission above a threshold log LX of\n27.6. A visual companion, estimated to be a late-A star, is also not\nexpected to be a strong X-ray emitter.\n4.3.4 H II 1431 (A0 V)\nH II 1431 also showed no X-ray emission above a threshold log LX\nof 27.6. This is somewhat surprising as it has a spectroscopic com-\npanion estimated to be a K star for which the X-ray emission would\nhave to be among the faintest 5 per cent for K stars in the Pleiades\naccording to the luminosity functions of Stauffer et al. (1994) and\nStelzer & Neuha\u00a8user (2001).\n4.3.5 H II 1234 (B9.5 V)\nH II 1234 showed a strong increase in X-ray output of a factor of\n\u223c2 toward the end of the observation (Fig. 3g). The quasi-steady\nspectrum required a second component or Z free for an acceptable fit,\nand a significant improvement was found using a 2-T Z free model.\nThe log LX of 29.5 and spectral parametrization: kT1 \u2248 0.4, kT2\n\u2248 1.1 keV, with EM2\/EM1 \u223c 1.5 and Z \u223c 0.25 Z\f, resemble\nthose for an active K star (Fig. 5). Spectral parametrization of the\nhigher emission state was poorly constrained but indicated higher\ntemperatures (\u223c0.7 and 2 keV), similar abundances and log LX \u2248\n29.7. H II 1234 also has a visual companion of intermediate type\nand is not expected to be a strong X-ray source. The X-ray emission\nwould be better explained by a hidden K-type companion in the\nsystem.\n4.3.6 The combined Chandra and XMM\u2013Newton sample\nX-ray emission from the detected intermediate-type stars in the\nXMM\u2013Newton observation appears to be consistent with coronal\nemission from companions of spectral types F, G or K. The inclu-\nsion of intermediate-type Pleiads in the Chandra field analysed by\nDLG02 more than doubles the sample size (Table 4). Our inter-\npretation of the results from the combined sample is that the soft\nX-ray emission from the three F-type stars is probably dominated\nby coronal emission from the primaries (or the F-type companion\nin H II 1338), while the strong, soft X-ray emission of the A and\nB stars H II 956, 980 and 1762 is not intrinsic (as proposed by\nKrishnamurthi et al. 2001), but due to F-type, or moderately active\nG-type companions, which are probably identical with companions\nalready noted in the literature. Conversely, the companions of H II\n1431 and 1284 are unusually weak X-ray-emitters if they are truly\nK-type stars. The strong, harder emissions of H II 1234 and 1384 are\nplausibly due to highly active K- and G-type companions, respec-\ntively, but neither have yet been discovered. Dedicated radial veloc-\nity and interferometric studies are required to confirm the presence\nof such companions, in tandem with a wider XMM\u2013Newton and\/or\nChandra X-ray spectroscopic survey of intermediate-type Pleiads\nto increase the sample size. If it can be firmly demonstrated that\nX-ray emission from intermediate-type stars is solely due to com-\npanions, X-ray studies may become an effective method of not only\nsurveying the binarity status of stars in this mass range, but also\nconstraining the spectral types of companions.\n5 S U M M A RY\nWe have performed detailed spectral and timing analyses of a sam-\nple of 13 intermediate-type and solar-like Pleiads, contained in a\n40-ks XMM\u2013Newton EPIC observation of the core of the cluster,\nthat enabled the study of individual members with X-ray luminosi-\nties an order of magnitude lower than achieved using ROSAT . All\nsolar-like members (one F, two G and five K stars) had LX \u0001 1029\nerg s\u22121 and consistent with a rotation\u2013activity connection: three ul-\ntrafast rotators emitted at a saturated level. Variable emission was\nobserved from the K stars and fast-rotating G star, and the four\nwith highest quasi-steady LX\/Lbol values exhibited flares. Hydro-\ndynamic modelling of the flares on H II 1032 and 1100 led us to\ninfer loop structures of half lengths L < 0.5R\u0003. The light curve of\nH II 1100 showed a dip feature that could be due to an eclipse by a\n\u2018hot Jupiter\u2019-like planet, absorption by a cool prominence with N H\n> 1022 cm\u22122 moving across the line of sight at several hundred km\ns\u22121, or the coincidence of two flares, the first with an unusual decay,\nfaster than its rise, indicating a small loop, L < 0.02R\u0003. None of\nthese explanations is satisfactory in likelihood or precedent, but the\nexistence of a planet may be tested by optical photometric monitor-\ning of the star for transits with a depth of \u22480.02 mag, followed by\na spectroscopic search for radial velocity variations, though the star\nis faint (V = 12.16). Spectral modelling of the quasi-steady X-ray\nemission using two-temperature models: (i) confirmed the temper-\nature sequence with spectral type (in order of rising temperature: F,\nslowly rotating G, K, fast-rotating G) deduced from composite spec-\ntra of Pleiades samples using the lower-resolution ROSAT PSPC and\n(ii) indicated subsolar metallicities. The results show that solar-like\nPleiads conform to expectations from well-studied active solar-like\nstars, although none of the three UFRs had the hot, 2-keV compo-\nnent seen in the saturated coronae of the nearby stars AB Dor and\n47 Cas. Three of the five intermediate-type Pleiads showed strong\nX-ray emission consistent with coronal emission from a solar-like\ncompanion. For such systems, the X-ray spectrum gives a useful\ninsight into the spectral type of the companion.\nAC K N OW L E D G M E N T S\nKRB and JPP acknowledge the financial support of the UK Particle\nPhysics and Astronomy Research Council (PPARC).
