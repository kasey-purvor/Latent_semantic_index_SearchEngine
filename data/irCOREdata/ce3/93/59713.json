As a component of ecological status, many \nEuropean countries are developing a classification scheme for chlorophyll \nconcentrations as a measure of phytoplankton biomass.  The chlorophyll classification \nmust be based on the degree of divergence of a water body from an appropriate \nbaseline, or \u2018reference condition\u2019.  This paper describes the development of a series of \nregression models for predicting reference chlorophyll concentrations on a site-\nspecific basis.  For model development a large dataset of European lakes considered \nto be in reference condition, 466 lakes in total, was assembled. Data were included \nfrom 12 European countries, but lakes from Northern and Western Europe dominated \nand made up 92% of all reference lakes.  Data have been collated on chlorophyll \nconcentration, altitude, mean depth, alkalinity, humic type, surface area, and \ngeographical region.  Regression models were developed for estimating site-specific \nreference chlorophyll concentrations from significant predictor \u2018typology\u2019 variables. \nReference chlorophyll concentrations were found to vary along a number of \nenvironmental gradients. Concentrations increased with colour and alkalinity, and \ndecreased with lake depth and altitude.  Forward selection was used to identify \nindependent explanatory variables in regression models for predicting site-specific \nreference chlorophyll concentrations.  Depth was selected as an explanatory variable \nin all models. Alkalinity was included in models for low colour and humic lakes and \naltitude was included in models for low colour and very humic lakes. Uncertainty in \nthe models was quite high and arises from errors in the data used to develop the \nmodels (including natural temporal and spatial variability in data) and also from \nadditional explanatory variables not considered in the models, particularly nutrient \nconcentrations, retention time and grazing.  Despite these uncertainties, site-specific \nreference conditions are still recommended in preference to type-specific reference \nconditions, as they use the individual characteristics of a site known to influence \nphytoplankton biomass, rather than adopt standards set to generally represent a large \npopulation of lakes of a particular type. For this reason, site-specific reference \nconditions should result in reduced error in ecological status classifications, \nparticularly for lakes close to typology boundaries. \n2 \n Introduction \nThe estimation of reference conditions is considered crucial in many ecological \nassessment programmes (e.g. Moss et al., 1996; US EPA, 2000). These provide the \nbaseline from which to determine change with time, and are necessary to evaluate a \nsite\u2019s current status or potential for change.  The European Water Framework \nDirective (WFD: Directive, 2000), also prescribes the use of reference conditions in \nthe ecological status assessment of surface waters. As a component of ecological \nstatus, many European countries are developing a classification scheme for \nchlorophyll concentrations, as a relatively simple measure of water quality, in \nresponse to eutrophication pressures (e.g. S\u00f8ndergaard et al., 2005).  Type-specific \nchlorophyll reference concentrations have previously been established (Carvalho et \nal., 2008) and also agreed at a European level through an \u201cIntercalibration\u201d process \n(Poikane et al., 2009). The analysis, however, highlighted that even type-specific \nreference chlorophyll concentrations may not be ideal as the effects of certain \ntypology factors, such as water colour and depth, on chlorophyll concentrations are \ncontinuous, and do not cause abrupt step-change differences between types (Carvalho \net al., 2008). Sites that lie close to lake type boundaries may, therefore, be poorly \nrepresented by type-specific reference conditions and lead to large errors in any \nreference-based status assessment. Site-specific reference conditions may, therefore, \nbe ecologically more appropriate and can be established simply from empirical \nregression models from a population of reference lakes (c.f. MEI model: Vighi & \nChiaudani, 1985; Cardoso et al., 2007). Another advantage of developing regression \nmodels for deriving site-specific reference conditions is that reference conditions \ncould be established for lakes that do not fall strictly into the intercalibration lake \ntypes for which values have been agreed. \nFurthermore a more quantitative understanding of how factors affect the natural \nbackground levels of phytoplankton chlorophyll in freshwater lakes is of interest to \nfreshwater scientists in general.  Regression models could be of potential value in \npredicting how water quality standards may be affected by future environmental \nchanges, such as decreased levels of dissolved organic carbon in lake waters \nassociated with climate change (Freeman et al., 2004) or reductions in acid deposition \n(Monteith et al., 2007) \n \n3 \n This paper describes the development of a series of regression models for \npredicting reference chlorophyll concentrations on a site-specific basis for lakes in \nNorthern and Western Europe. \n \nMaterial and Methods \n \nCriteria for reference lake selection \nReference conditions are a state corresponding to low anthropogenic pressure on the \nwhole water body.  Reference lakes are not necessarily pristine, but must demonstrate \nonly very minor effects of major industrialisation, urbanisation and intensification of \nagriculture in their catchment (CIS, 2003).  What constitutes very minor pressure is \nopen to debate.  The selection of reference sites for this analysis was, however, \ncarried out by individual Member States using agreed criteria laid down in WFD \nguidance (CIS, 2003).  Further details of the criteria used and the comparability \nbetween Member States are documented in Carvalho et al. (2008).  Additionally for \nthis analysis, a threshold mean TP concentration of 100 \u00b5g l-1 was used as a final \ncriterion, above which sites were removed from the analysis.  This resulted in 5 sites \n(all with TP concentrations >150\u00b5g l-1) being excluded out of a total of 545 sites.  The \nTP concentrations in the remaining dataset of 540 reference lakes were all lower than \n70 \u00b5g l-1, with only three sites having concentrations >50 \u00b5g l-1.   \n \n \nData \nData from reference sites were collated on chlorophyll concentration, altitude, surface \narea, mean depth, alkalinity, colour and humic type.  Lake data were gathered from \nnational datasets from individual Member States through partners in the EC \nREBECCA Project (see http:\/\/www.environment.fi\/syke\/rebecca) and from EC and \nMS representatives involved in the Intercalibration process.  Inevitably with such a \nlarge dataset of lakes from many countries there are questions over the quality of the \ndata.  To minimise sources of error in the dataset, lakes were only included in the \nanalysis if they had three or more samples from different months between the period \nApril to September (a \u2018growing period\u2019 in all lakes in the dataset).  This is because \nprevious analysis has shown that a single monthly sample is not sufficiently \nrepresentative of an annual chlorophyll mean whereas bi-monthly or monthly \n4 \n sampling results in much less variable estimates (Clarke et al., 2006).  If data from \nseveral years were provided for an individual lake, these growth season means were \naveraged over the years.  If data from several sites within a lake were provided, these \nsite means were averaged to give a whole lake mean, to ensure no bias was given to \nany particular lake in the model development.  Additionally, sites were only included \nin the analysis for model building if measured depth and alkalinity data were available \nand at least information on humic type (low colour, humic or very humic) using \ncolour criteria outlined in Van de Bund et al. (2004). \nThis resulted in a large dataset of 510 European lakes considered to be in \nreference condition, with 466 lakes having typology information suitable for \ndeveloping the regression models. Data were included from 12 European countries, \nbut lakes from Norway and Finland dominated and made up 82% of all reference \nlakes (Table 1).  Despite the bias towards Northern and Western Europe (92% of \nlakes), the dataset provides extensive coverage across a number of environmental \ngradients thought to be influential in determining background chlorophyll \nconcentrations.  High alkalinity lakes, were, however, poorly represented in the \ndataset, particularly deep or very shallow ones (Figure 1). \n \n \nStatistical analysis \nThe relationships between chlorophyll concentrations and potential predictor variables \n(e.g. alkalinity, depth, altitude, area) were initially examined using simple boxplots \nand descriptive statistics by lake type.  Lake types followed common agreed \ntypologies in the intercalibration process (Van de Bund et al., 2004) \nTo derive models for estimating site-specific reference chlorophyll \nconcentrations, we ran a General Linear Model (GLM) to estimate the best model to \npredict mean chlorophyll from several predictor variables. Altitude, alkalinity, mean \ndepth, surface area and chlorophyll were all log transformed to normalize the data.  \nPrior to the GLM, Pearson correlations were computed for each pair of variables to \nselect the potential predictor variables. Lake area had a highly significant correlation \nwith lake depth (r2 = 0.36, p <0.001, n = 502) and so was not considered further in the \nanalysis in order to minimise the variance inflation factor. All the statistical analysis \nwere performed with the statistics software SPSS (version 12, 2003) or Minitab (v14, \n2005) \n5 \n Data on colour was provided in two forms: humic type (low, high or very high) \nor as measured colour data (Platinum units).  Due to limitation of colour data from \nonly 298 of the 540 lakes, regression models were developed for lakes of different \nhumic type.  Following development of these type-specific regression models, an F-\ntest was applied to examine whether type-specific regression lines were significantly \ndifferent from each other and\/or a global model. \nData were not generally available on analytical methods used for measuring \nchlorophyll.  Of the five Member States providing information, all used \nspectrophotometric methods for routine monitoring. Extraction solvents and \nextraction time, however, varied both within, and between, Member States (ethanol, \nmethanol or acetone extraction for 4-24 hours).  Similarly, no information was \navailable on whether or not an acidification step was used to correct for chlorophyll \ndegradation products (pheophytin) and what equations were used to convert \nabsorbance values to pigment concentrations. Of the two countries providing detailed \nmethodologies (Estonia and Scotland), equations developed by Lorenzen (1967) and \nJeffrey & Humphrey (1975) were used, indicating an acidification step was \nincorporated. \n \nResults \n \nResponses along environmental gradients \nCorrelation analysis revealed significant relationships between log chlorophyll and \nlog depth (r2 = -0.494, p <0.001, n= 505), log colour (r2 = 0.481, p <0.001, n= 298) \nand log alkalinity (r2 = 0.213, p <0.001, n= 497). \nThe strongest gradients were observed for depth and humic type.  In terms of \ndepth only, deep lakes generally had the lowest chlorophyll concentrations (median \n1.9 \u00b5g l-1) and also showed the least variability, shallow lakes were intermediate \n(median 2.8 \u00b5g l-1) whilst very shallow lakes had the highest concentrations (median \n7.3 \u00b5g l-1) and were also most variable (Figure 2).  In terms of humic type, low colour \nwaters had the lowest chlorophyll concentrations and showed the least variability \n(median 2.1 \u00b5g l-1), humic lakes were intermediate (median 4.1 \u00b5g l-1) whilst very \nhumic lakes had the highest concentrations and were also most variable (median 11.6 \n\u00b5g l-1) (Figure 3).  Chlorophyll concentrations generally increased with increasing \nalkalinity although there were only slight differences in median values (and little \n6 \n difference in variability between alkalinity types (low alkalinity lakes: median 2.4 \u00b5g \nl-1; medium alkalinity lakes: median 3.2 \u00b5g l-1; high alkalinity lakes: median 3.4 \u00b5g l-\n1).  One exception of this pattern was for high alkalinity deep lakes, which showed \nlower chlorophyll concentrations than low and medium alkalinity lakes of this depth \ntype (Figure 4) \nFigure 5 illustrates for depth, how chlorophyll concentrations are a continuous \nresponse along this gradient and do not show any threshold response at type \nboundaries.  Similar continuous responses were observed for colour and alkalinity. \n \nRegression analysis \nApproximately 200 of the 500 reference lakes were missing colour data, yet colour \nappeared to be a strong factor in determining reference chlorophyll concentrations.  \nOf the 294 sites with colour data, 53% were classified by member states as humic or \nvery humic lakes.  Of the 246 lakes with no available colour data, a very large \nproportion (71%) was classified as low colour lakes.  For this reason, it was decided \nto develop separate regression models for predicting site-specific chlorophyll \nreference conditions for lakes of different humic types and without using colour data \nas a predictor variable for low-humic waters. \nDepth had a negative coefficient in all the regression models (Table 2).  The \nother predictor variables selected differed between different lake types, although \nwhen selected had the same general effect (i.e. alkalinity was positive, altitude was \nnegative).  The best predictive model was produced for very humic lakes, although \nwith an r2 of 0.358 was still not high (Table 2). \n \n \n \nDiscussion \n \nResponses along Environmental Gradients \nObservations of chlorophyll concentrations in a large population of reference lakes, \nindicate that background or reference concentrations show a continuous response to a \nnumber of environmental gradients.  No threshold responses, or step changes were \napparent in scatterplots (e.g. Figure 5).  This indicates that site-specific chlorophyll \nreference conditions, based on significant explanatory variables, are more appropriate \n7 \n than type-specific standards and should lead to less error in ecological status \nassessments. \nHigher chlorophyll concentrations observed with decreasing depth were as \nexpected, reflecting the well established positive relationship between algal biomass \nand light availability throughout the year (Sakamoto, 1966; Scheffer, 1998) and \nprobably also due to the fact that deeper lakes generally have a higher water residence \ntime and a lower nutrient loading per volume of water.  Similarly, the increasing \nvariability, or unpredictability, with decreasing depth presumably highlights the \npotential for much greater internal biotic control on phytoplankton production due to \nmacrophyte and grazer control of phytoplankton in shallow lakes compared with deep \nlakes (Jeppesen et al., 1998).  Very shallow lakes not only have very high potential for \nphytoplankton growth throughout the year, they also have the greatest potential for \ntop-down limitation by zooplankton grazers and competition for light and nutrients \nwith macrophytes.  This may also be the explanation for the very shallow, high \nalkalinity lakes having lower chlorophyll concentrations than shallow and deep lakes \nof this same alkalinity type.  The generally positive relationship between chlorophyll \nand alkalinity was, however, as expected, as it is well established that background \nnutrient availability is generally greater with increasing alkalinity (Dillon & Kirchner \n1975; Vighi & Chaudani 1985; Cardoso et al., 2007). \nShifts in phytoplankton composition could be responsible for some of the \ngradients observed in chlorophyll.  Chlorophyll content of cells varies between \ndifferent algal taxa, for example cyanobacteria and diatoms have more accessory \npigments and less chlorophylla per unit biovolume compared with Chlorophyta \n(Reynolds, 2006). Higher chlorophyll concentrations observed with increasing colour \nor humic type were not as originally expected, as it was envisaged that the reduced \nlight availability in deeply coloured waters would reduce the potential for \nphytoplankton production.  One reason for the observation may be because of \ncompositional shifts in phytoplankton in very humic waters, with recognised shifts to \nlarge mixotrophic species, such as Gonyostomum semen (Arvola et al., 1999; Salonen \net al., 2002).  Additionally, phytoplankton have been shown become adapted to low \nlight availability by producing more chlorophyll per unit biomass (Reynolds, 2006; \nGreisberger & Teubner, 2007). \n \n8 \n Regressions \nThe regression equations incorporated coefficients that reflect the patterns observed \nalong the environmental gradients, i.e increasing chlorophyll with increasing colour, \ndecreasing depth and increasing alkalinity.  Altitude was also a significant additional \npredictor in low humic lakes and borderline significant and included in model for very \nhumic lakes. Increasing altitude being related to reduced chlorophyll concentrations, \npresumably due to lower temperatures and possibly also less nutrient availability in \nupland regions. \nNone of the regression models developed have a particularly strong predictive \nability.  This uncertainty may arise from two main sources: \n1) Error \/ uncertainty in data used to develop regression models \n2) Additional explanatory variables not considered in models \nIn terms of error in data used to develop the regression models, some of this \nmay be due to sources of error associated with variable methods.  It is widely \nrecognised in particular that different solvents used for extraction of chlorophyll, for \nexample acetone, ethanol or HPLC, all have variable extraction efficiencies, as does \nthe timing, temperature and manner of extraction (Jacobsen & Rai, 1990). To ensure \ncomparable chlorophyll data across Europe, we strongly recommend standardised \nsampling, storage and analytical methods.  Methods for measuring water colour and \nalkalinity for WFD typology purposes may also benefit from standardisation. \nThe variability in the data used to develop the models may, however, also have \narisen from spatial and temporal variability in the water quality data.  Strong seasonal, \nhorizontal and, in deep lakes, vertical gradients in chlorophyll concentrations are \ntypical in freshwater lakes (Small, 1963; Fee, 1976).  Temporal variability was partly \novercome by only considering lakes with three or more samples from different \nmonths in the period April to September only.  It has, however, been shown that even \nregular monthly sampling (i.e. 6 samples from April to September) still produces an \nestimate of a mean chlorophyll concentration with a percentage SE of 14% for a \nshallow lake and 13% for a deep lake (Clarke et al., 2007). \nUncertainty in the regression models may also be due to the fact that other \nimportant predictor variables were not considered in the models.  Colour data were \nclearly lacking for many low humic lakes and water temperature was also not \navailable.  More importantly, however, key phytoplankton loss processes were not \nrepresented in particular no data were readily available on retention time, grazing and \n9 \n macrophyte coverage.  We strongly recommend that retention time and water \ntemperature are considered in future model developments.  Both may help future-\nproof models for setting chlorophyll reference conditions under changing climatic \nregimes.  Retention time has also long been recognised as one of the key variables in \ndetermining both nutrient availability and chlorophyll concentrations in lakes \n(Vollenweider & Kerekes, 1982; Dillon, 1974).  Another widely recognised driver of \nchlorophyll concentrations is nutrient availability. Despite the fact that the lakes were \nall considered as reference lakes, there was still variation in phosphorus and nitrogen \nconcentrations and these are likely to be responsible for some of the variation \nobserved.  Whether this variation was due to slight differences in criteria used for \nreference site selection or differences in underlying geology, both result in varying \nlevels of background nutrient concentrations. \nBecause of the bias in the dataset towards Northern and Western European low \nand medium alkalinity lakes, the models are not currently recommended for \napplication to lakes in Central and Mediterranean regions of Europe where drivers of \nbackground productivity could be different.  Further development of models for these \nregions is greatly limited by the lack of lakes in these regions that qualify as suitable \nreference lakes. \nDespite these uncertainties, the analysis has revealed that site-specific reference \nconditions are generally recommended in preference to type-specific reference \nconditions, as they should result in reduced error in ecological status classifications, \nparticularly for lakes close to typology boundaries; sites in the middle of the type \nrange should be relatively unaffected.  The approach may also be useful for Member \nStates setting reference values for lakes that do not fall within agreed Intercalibration \ntypes, or Member States who have adopted more discrete typologies than some of the \nbroad Intercalibration types. \n \nAcknowledgements \nThis study was part-financed by the European Framework 6 Project REBECCA \n\u2018Relationships Between Ecological and Chemical Status of Surface Waters\u2019, Contract \nNo.: SSPI-CT-2003-502158.
