Each of the four telescopes\nof 107 m2 mirror area is equipped with a 960-pixel photomulitiplier-tube camera.\nThis paper describes the methods used to convert the photomultiplier signals into\nthe quantities needed for Cherenkov image analysis. Two independent calibration\ntechniques have been applied in parallel to provide an estimation of uncertainties.\nResults on the long-term stability of the H.E.S.S. cameras are also presented.\n2\n1 Introduction\nThe Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Technique is the primary method for\nobservations of very high energy (>100 GeV) \u03b3-rays. In this technique \u03b3-rays\nare detected indirectly via the Cherenkov light emitted by the charged particles\nof the induced air-shower. Images of the shower in one or several telescopes\nare analysed to provide background suppression and to reconstruct primary\n\u03b3-ray parameters.\nThe H.E.S.S. (High Energy Stereoscopic System) detector [1] consists of four\ntelescopes located in Namibia at 1800 meters altitude. Each telescope is com-\nposed of a 107 m2 mirror [2,3] and a camera whose field of view is 5\u25e6 in\ndiameter. The camera focal plane is covered by 960 photomultiplier tubes\n(PMTs) with 0.16\u25e6 angular extent. To decrease the camera read-out window\nand the level of noise, very compact electronics located just behind the PMTs\nis used (see [4] for a short description). The first H.E.S.S. telescope has been\noperating since July 2002 and the system was completed in December 2003.\nIt is essential for the extraction of parameters characterizing the air-shower\nimages based on the raw PMT data to calibrate accurately the PMTs and\nthe electronic response. The calibration scheme described below is based in\npart on techniques developed for the CAT detector [5], the Durham Mark 6\ndetector [6] and the HEGRA detector [7,8].\nThe parameters used in the calibration of the H.E.S.S. cameras and the meth-\nods used to derive them are described below. Results on the stability of pho-\ntomultiplier gain and overall telescope efficiency are also described.\n\u2217 Corresponding author, khelifi@mpi-hd.mpg.de\n\u2217\u2217Corresponding author, rolland@lpnhep.in2p3.fr\n1 now at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Homi Bhabha Road, Mum-\nbai 400 005, India\n2 Institut Universitaire de France\n3 now at Department of Physics and Astronomy, Iowa State University, Ames,\nIowa 50011-3160, USA\n4 now at Department of Physics and Astronomy, Univ. of Sheffield, The Hicks\nBuilding, Hounsfiled Road, Sheffield S3 7RH, U.K.\n3\n2 The H.E.S.S. cameras\nThe electronics of the cameras of the H.E.S.S. system are divided into two\nparts: the front-end electronics in 16-pixel drawers and the back-end electro-\nnics in a crate at the rear of the camera. Each of the 60 drawers in a camera\ncontains 16 PMTs and associated acquisition and local trigger electronic cards.\nThe analogue signals are digitised in the drawers and then the digital signals\nare sent to the acquisition crate. Data are sent to the central data acquisition\nsystem via an optical fibre. The connection to the array trigger is via an\nadditional optical fibre.\n2.1 The acquisition channels\nEach drawer (16 pixels, see Figure 1) is composed of two acquisition cards, each\nreading the data from 8 PMTs, as shown in Figure 2. For each pixel, there are\nthree channels, one trigger channel and two acquisition channels with different\ngains: the high-gain (HG) channel is used to detect signal charges up to 200\nphotoelectrons (p.e.); the low-gain (LG) channel is used to cover the range\nfrom 15 to 1600 photoelectrons. Figure 3 illustrates the linear range used for\nanalysis for both channels. The PMT signal is measured across a resistor RPM\nand amplified into the two acquisition channels (HG and LG). The analogue\nsignal is then sampled in an Analogue Ring Sampler (ARS) initially developed\nby the CEA for the ANTARES experiment [9]. The sampling is performed\nat a rate of 1 GHz; the analogue voltage levels are stored in a ring buffer\nconsisting of 128 capacitor cells. Following a trigger signal, the sampling is\nstopped, the capacitor cells are addressed one by one, their analogue signals\nare impedance matched and a multiplexor distributes the signal from 4 ARSs\n(8 PMTs) into one Analogue to Digital Converter (ADC) with a conversion\nfactor V ADC of 1.22 mV\/(ADC count).Only NL (for normal observations set\nto 16) cells are converted into charge equivalent ADC counts, in the range\nwhere the Cherenkov signal is expected on the basis of the trigger timing.\nThe Section 3 describes how this timing is calibrated. The digitised signals\nare stored and processed in a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) on each\nacquisition card. In the normal read-out mode (charge mode), the NL samples\nare summed to give two ADC values per pixel (HG and LG). Data from the\ndrawers are sent to 8 FIFO memories located in a cPCI (Compact Peripheral\nComponent Interface) crate to be read back by the CPU.\nThe high-gain channel is sensitive to single photoelectrons: the number of\nADC counts between the pedestal and the signal from a single photoelectron\nis set to be \u2248 80 ADC counts (for a PMT gain of 2 \u00d7 105). This value is\nchosen such that the single photoelectron peak can be clearly distinguished at\n4\nFig. 1.

The electronic noise of the system\nis such that the pedestal width is typically 20% of a photoelectron (\u2248 16 ADC\ncounts RMS). The low electronic noise and good sampling allow a precise gain\ncalibration of every pixel.\n2.2 PMT high voltage supply and slow control\nIn addition to the acquisition cards, a drawer contains a number of monitor-\ning functions including three temperatures sensors, as well as individual high\nvoltage supplies for each channel, which are controlled by the control\/interface\nboard. The high voltage supplies are DC-DC converters with active regulation\nfor the cathode (on negative high voltage) and the four last dynodes. The high\nvoltage is set via an analogue level supplied by the control board, and is ad-\njusted to provide a uniform PMT gain across the camera. In order to minimise\n5\nFig. 3. Linearity of the high gain channel (left-hand side) and low gain channel\n(right-hand side). Measured signal in ADC counts is shown against input signal in\nphotoelectrons. The useful zones used for the analysis are shown.\ntransit time differences between PMTs caused by the different high voltages\napplied, PMTs were sorted into drawers and cameras according to their gain.\nA high voltage divider and ADC allows the actual high voltage to be read\nback. In order to monitor pixel performance and to identify pixels receiving\nlight from stars, both the total current provided by the high voltage supply\nto the PMT and the divider chain (\u201cHVI\u201d) as well as the DC anode current\n(\u201cDCI\u201d) are monitored. The \u201cDCI\u201d current depends on the PMT illumination\nand the electronic chain offset.\n2.3 Calibration parameters\nStandard Cherenkov analysis use as a starting point the signal amplitude of\neach pixel. The amplitude is the charge in p.e. induced by light on the PMT,\nthis charge being corrected by the relative efficiency of this pixel compared to\nthe mean value over the camera (\u201cflat-fielding\u201d, see Section 7). The calibration\nprovides the required conversion coefficients from ADC counts to corrected\nphotoelectrons.\nFor each event, ADC counts are measured in both channels, ADCHG for the\nhigh gain channel and ADCLG for the low gain channel. The calculation of\nthe amplitude in photoelectrons received by every pixel is, for both channels:\n6\nAHG=\nADCHG \u2212 PHG\n\u03b3ADCe\n\u00d7 FF\nALG=\nADCLG \u2212 PLG\n\u03b3ADCe\n\u00d7 (HG\/LG)\u00d7 FF (1)\nwhere,\n\u2022 PHG and PLG are the ADC position of the base-line for both channels, which\nare the pedestal positions,\n\u2022 \u03b3ADCe is the gain of the high gain channel in ADC counts per p.e.,\n\u2022 HG\/LG is the amplification ratio of the high gain to the low gain,\n\u2022 and FF is the flat-field coefficient.\nThe flat-field coefficient corrects for different optical and quantum efficiencies\nbetween pixels within a camera.\nFor the image analysis, AHG and ALG are used to provide a single pixel ampli-\ntude. Provided that both gain channels function properly, the HG value alone\nis used up to \u2248 150 p.e. (see Figure 3) and the LG value beyond \u2248 200 p.e.\nFor intermediate values, a weighted average of the HG and LG values is used\nand the amplitude is given by:\nA = (1\u2212 \u01eb)\u00d7ADCHG + \u01eb\u00d7 ADCLG (2)\nwhere \u01eb \u2248 (ADCHG \u2212 150)\/(200\u2212 150).\nTo conclude, for both channels of every pixel, the calibration must provide\nthe pedestal positions, the high gain \u03b3ADCe , and the ratio of the high gain to\nthe low gain. As the flat-fielding coefficients do not depend on the electronics,\nthey are calculated per pixel and not per (HG or LG) channel as will be seen\nlater (see Section 7). It is also essential that any non-operational channels or\npixels are identified in the calibration process in order to avoid miscalculation\nof amplitudes.\n3 Timing of the readout window\nA time window containing only NL cells (from the 128 available) is read from\nthe ARS (see Section 2.1). These cells are selected as follow. When the reading\ncommand is received, the ARS stops sampling and the first cell of the readout\nwindow is the (128\u2212Nd)th sample in the past from the latest filled sample in\nthe circular buffer. Nd is the time between the moment the signal is received\nby the pixel and the moment the trigger signal comes back to the drawer.\n7\nThe Nd value has then to be calibrated in order that the Cherenkov signal\nintegrated over the NL cells is maximised.\nThe position of the readout window (the Nd value) is verified frequently using\nthe sample mode facility of the ARSs. In this mode, the charge of the NL cells\n(each of 1 ns) is read and stored. The pulse shape can be then studied, as well\nas the readout timing. The position of the charge peak in the readout window\nis used to adjust the timing.\nFigure 4 gives an example of data from a sample mode run made with air-\nshower events. The electronic noise in each cell, obtained using events which\ndo not contain contributions due to Cherenkov light, is subtracted to extract\nthe pulse shape. They are averaged over the HG channel for each telescope.\nFrom the ARS sample mode, the accuracy of timing of the readout window is\nabout 1 ns.\nSample (ns)\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14\nA\nD\nC \nCo\nun\nts\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\n20 CT 1\nCT 2\nCT 3\nCT 4\nFig. 4. Mean signal samples over HG channels for the four cameras for air-shower\nevents.\n4 Estimation of pedestals\nThe pedestal position is defined as the mean ADC value recorded in the absence\nof any Cherenkov light.\nIn the dark, electronic noise creates a narrow Gaussian ADC distribution whose\nmean is the pedestal position. However, the pedestal position has some depen-\n8\ndence on camera temperature, which varies between 20\u25e6C and 40\u25e6C depending\non the season and the weather. The typical temperature variation during a\nrun is of the order of 1\u25e6C. The pedestals must therefore be calculated for\nall channels during time-slices as short as possible to minimise the impact of\npedestal drift due to temperature variations in the electronics.\nDuring observations, the pixels are illuminated by night-sky background (NSB)\nphotons, greatly increasing the pedestal width. There is over 1 p.e. of NSB per\nreadout window in normal operation. Due to the capacitive coupling of the\nPMT signals to the ARS (see Figure 2) the pedestal position remains constant\nin the usual NSB range in Namibia. The mean pedestal position therefore\ncorresponds to the position in ADC counts of zero photoelectrons of Cherenkov\nlight.\n4.1 Dark pedestal\nTo measure precisely the electronic noise in all channels, ADC distributions\nare taken in the absence of background light. The lids of all cameras are closed\nand the ADC distributions are randomly measured by software triggering of\nthe cameras when the internal camera temperature is stable.\nThe resulting pedestal is determined by the base-line voltage of the electronic\nchannels at the input of the ADC. These base-lines are approximately \u22120.9 V\nfor both channels, corresponding to \u2248 \u2212730 ADC counts. In charge mode, after\nthe summation of the 16 samples, the ADC counts are then \u2248 \u221211500 ADC\ncounts: this is the typical electronic pedestal position. Measured pedestals lie\nin the range from -13000 to -11000 ADC counts. Random noise from PMTs\nand from electronic components is responsible for the pedestal width (see Fig-\nure 5). The noise at the input of the ADC is about 20mV in the high-gain\nchannel, which gives a pedestal RMS of 16 ADC counts or about 0.2 p.e., and\n7mV in the low-gain channel, which gives a pedestal RMS of 6 ADC counts\nor about 1 p.e.\nRuns taken with the camera lids closed can also be used to measure the drift\nof pedestal values with temperature using the temperature sensors mounted\nat three positions in every drawer. The dark pedestal position is correlated\nwith temperature. The overall behaviour is a decreasing pedestal position for\nincreasing temperature. As the shift can be as large as -50 ADC counts\/degree,\npedestal positions for observation runs must be calculated frequently (roughly\nevery minute) to achieve the required precision (\u226a1 p.e.).\n9\nADC counts\n-11850 -11800 -11750 -11700 -11650 -11600 -11550 -11500\nEn\ntr\nie\ns\n0\n500\n1000\n1500\n2000\n2500\n3000\nLow gain\nHigh gain\nFig. 5. ADC distributions of dark pedestals for the high and low gain channels of a\nsingle pixel.\n4.2 Pedestal with night-sky background\nDuring an observation run, the NSB modifies the ADC distributions of pedes-\ntals. As the coupling between PMT and ARS behaves like a RC circuit, the\nshort photoelectron pulses (of positive polarity due to the inverting amplifiers)\nare followed by a slight negative undershoot over a few micro-seconds. For\ntypical NSB rates, of order 100 MHz (in units of p.e. per second), the time\nbetween NSB photoelectrons is short compared to the time constant of the\nundershoot. The undershoots combine and average, causing a negative shift\nof the base-line, onto which NSB photoelectron signals are superimposed in a\nway that the overall average level remains at the dark-pedestal value.\nWhen pedestals are measured during observation runs, the resulting distribu-\ntions depend on the level of the NSB. For low NSB, it can happen that no NSB\nphotoelectron arrives within the 16 ns integration window (see Section 2.1);\nin this case the measured pedestals have a similar narrow width to the dark\npedestals, but exhibit a negative shift. Combining such events with events\nwith one or more NSB photoelectrons which are fully or partly contained in\nthe integration window, one finds a pedestal distribution with a sharp rise\nand peak at the location of the shifted dark pedestal, followed by a smeared\nsingle-photoelectron peak and a tail towards higher values (distribution for\n10\n50 MHz NSB in Figure 6).\nAt higher NSB levels, well above 100 MHz, there are usually several photoelec-\ntrons within the integration window and the pedestal distribution is essentially\nGaussian, with a width given by the square root of the mean number of NSB\nphotoelectrons (up to small corrections for the electronic noise, the width\nof the single-photoelectron amplitude distribution and the effect of photoelec-\ntron signals truncated by the integration window). The two other distributions\nshown in Figure 6 for 110 MHz and 140 MHz NSB rates represent intermediate\ncases, where the asymmetric shape of the Poisson distribution in the number\nof photoelectrons in the integration window is still visible.\nADC counts\n-12300 -12200 -12100 -12000 -11900 -11800 -11700 -11600 -11500 -11400\nN\num\nbe\nr o\nf e\nve\nnt\ns\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\nwithout NSB\n Hz8 10\u00d7NSB ~ 0.5 \n Hz8 10\u00d7NSB ~ 1.1 \n Hz8 10\u00d7NSB ~ 1.4 \nFig. 6. ADC distributions of pedestals at different night-sky background rates in\nreal data.\nPedestals for observation runs are determined as often as possible in order to\naccount for camera temperature variations. As a shower image contains typi-\ncally only 20 pixels, real triggered events are used to measure pedestals. Pixels\ncontaining Cherenkov light are rejected. To identify such image pixels, ampli-\ntudes (in p.e.) are roughly calculated using the previously-calculated pedestal\nand using the nominal gain of channels (80 ADC counts per p.e. for the HG\nand 6 for the LG). For a given pixel, if neighbouring pixels have a signal ampli-\ntude above a threshold (around 1.5 to 3 p.e.) or if its own amplitude is above\na threshold, this pixel is suspected to be contaminated by Cherenkov light.\nSo this pixel\u2019s value for this event does not contribute to this pixel pedestal\nhistogram. This algorithm is applied for all pixels and all events until there\n11\nare enough entries in pedestal histograms to determine accurately the pedestal\npositions from the mean of the histogram. The frequency of pedestal updates\ndepends on the event rate of the observation run; pedestals are calculated\napproximately every minute.\n5 Estimation of night-sky background\nKnowledge of the actual NSB rate in each pixel \u2013 possibly influenced by a\nstar in the field of view of the pixel \u2013 is important to judge if a pixel can be\nincluded in the image analysis. The NSB rate can be determined in two ways,\nfrom the pedestal width as illustrated in the previous section, and from the\nPMT currents.\n5.1 NSB from pedestals width\nOne method to estimate the NSB brightness is to use the pixel pedestal widths.\nThis technique is used as standard by the VERITAS collaboration [10]. During\nan observation, the pedestal width is dominated by NSB photon fluctuations.\nThe typical pedestal RMS is about 100 ADC counts for the HG channel, cor-\nresponding to roughly 1.2 p.e. The NSB rate is estimated from the square of\nthe pedestal width (subtracting the electronic noise and the charge dispersion\nof a single photoelectron in quadrature):\nFNSB =\n\u221a\nRMS2P \u2212RMS20 \u2212 \u03c32\u03b3e \/ (NL \u03c4) Hz (3)\nwhere RMSP is the pedestal RMS in p.e., RMS0 is the electronic pedestal\nRMS in p.e., \u03c3\u03b3e is the charge dispersion in p.e. of a single photoelectron and\nNL\u00d7 \u03c4 = 16\u00d710\u22129 is the readout window in seconds. This expression should\nbe accurate within 10-20% considering the corrections mentioned earlier.\n5.2 NSB from PMTs currents\nBecause of its small temperature dependence and its larger range, the total\ncurrent drawn by each PMT from the HV supply (HVI) is used to estimate the\nNSB, rather than the anode current (DCI). The HVI current is composed of\nthe current drawn in the absence of illumination (mainly the divider current,\nproportional to the high voltage) and a component which increases linearly\nwith the anode current. The shift of the HVI current from its dark value\n12\nagainst DC p.e. flux (FNSB) is shown in Figure 7. The relationship is described\nby Equation 4.\nFNSB = (3.235\u00b1 0.006)\u00d7 107 \u00d7\u2206HV I\u00b5A (4)\nTo estimate the NSB with this method, one needs to know the values of the\nHVI in the dark. Values of the HVI base-lines, HVI0, are extracted regularly\nfrom runs taken with the camera lids closed. The ADC used to measure HVI\nhas a very small temperature dependence (with slopes in the range -0.02 to\n+0.03 \u00b5A\/\u25e6C) compared to the current produced by normal values of NSB,\n102 MHz, which is of the order of 3.2 \u00b5A. This temperature dependence can\nbe neglected in the estimation of NSB.\nHigh Voltage Current Shift (micro-A)\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nN\nSB\n e\nst\nim\nat\nio\nn \n(M\nHz\n)\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\nFig. 7.

A\nNSB rate of 250 MHz corresponds approximately to the presence of a star of\nmagnitude \u223c 4. Pixels with noise levels above this can be treated differently\nin the Cherenkov image analysis and are flagged as noisy.\n13\nNSB Estimated from HVI (MHz)\nN\nSB\n E\nst\nim\nat\ned\n fr\nom\n P\ned\nes\nta\nl W\nid\nth\n (M\nHz\n)\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600\nFig. 8.

The line drawn corresponds to a perfect\ncorrelation.\n6 Conversion factor between ADC counts and signal charge\nThe PMT signal, VPM (see Figure 2), is measured across a resistor and is\namplified into two acquisition channels, one with low gain GLG and the other\nwith high gain GHG. The amplified signals are then converted into a digital\nsignal with \u03c4 = 1 ns samples and summed over 16 ns. The conversion factor of\nthe ADC is approximately VADC=1.22mV\/Count. The number of (summed)\nADC counts equivalent to one photoelectron is (for both readout channels i):\n\u03b3ADCe,i =\nGi\n\u03c4 VADC\n\u222b\nVPM,s.p.e.(t) dt (5)\n14\nHere VPM,s.p.e. is the single photoelectron pulse shape. We define the pixel\ngain as this conversion factor. This factor includes the PMT gain, the signal\namplification in both readout channels and the integration in the ARS.\n6.1 LED pulser for single-photoelectron illumination\nSpecial runs are taken roughly every two days to determine the pixel gains. In\nthese runs a LED pulser is used to illuminate the camera with an intensity of\nabout 1 photoelectron\/pixel. The LED and a diffuser are installed two meters\nin front of the cameras in their shelter. The light intensity homogeneity over\nthe camera is 50 %. The calibration LED is pulsed at 70 Hz and the same\nsignal which pulses this LED is used to trigger the camera acquisition (after\na suitable fixed delay) such that the signal arrives centered in the readout\nwindow (as explained in Section 3).\n6.2 Determination of the gain of the HG channel\nThe pixel gain can be extracted from data taken under \u223c 1 photoelectron\nillumination via a fit to the ADC count distribution of each pixel. The ADC\ndistribution fit function is derived from the following assumptions: the number\nof photoelectrons follows a Poisson distribution, the electronic noise is much\nsmaller than the width of the single p.e. distribution, and the 1 p.e. distribu-\ntion is described by a Gaussian distribution. Then, the electronic pedestal is\napproximated by a Gaussian with a standard deviation \u03c3P and with a mean\nposition in ADC counts P . The light distribution for a given signal of n p.e.\n(n \u2208 N) is approximated also by a Gaussian with a standard deviation \u221an \u03c3\u03b3e\nand with a mean position in ADC counts P + n \u03b3ADCe , \u03b3\nADC\ne being the con-\nversion factor between ADC counts and photoelectrons and \u03c3\u03b3e is the RMS of\nthe charge induced by a single photoelectron. Under a mean light intensity \u00b5\nthe expected signal distribution is given by:\nG(x) = N\u00d7\n(\ne\u2212\u00b5\u221a\n2\u03c0\u03c3P\nexp\n[\n\u2212 1\n2\n(x\u2212 P\n\u03c3P\n)2]\n+ \u03ba\nm\u226b1\u2211\nn=1\ne\u2212\u00b5\u221a\n2\u03c0 \u03c3\u03b3e\n\u00b5n\nn!\nexp\n[\n\u2212 1\n2\n(x\u2212 (P + n \u03b3ADCe )\u221a\nn\u03c3\u03b3e\n)2])\n(6)\nThis function is used to fit the signal distribution of each pixel.

The high-gain \u03b3ADCe values are given in ADC\ncounts. By definition, the mean flat-field coefficient is 1.\nHowever, the fit may fail when the light intensity \u00b5 of the \u03b3ADCe measurement\nis too low or too high or when the corresponding ARS does not work properly\n16\n(see Section 9). No gain estimate is then available for this pixel and a gain of 80\nADC counts\/p.e. is assumed. In this case, the flat-field coefficient compensates\nfor any deviation from the nominal gain (see Section 7).\nLaboratory measurements show that the single photoelectron distribution of\nthe Photonis XP2960 PMTs used by H.E.S.S. is significantly non-Gaussian.\nThe fit to the signal distribution assuming a Gaussian shape leads to a bias\nof a few percent in the determined gain. This bias is included and accounted\nin our simulations (which use the measured single-p.e. distribution).\n6.3 Determination of the gain of the LG channel\nIn the regime where both gain channels are linear (30 to 150 p.e. in order to\nbe conservative - see Figure 3) the ratio of the signals provides a measurement\nof the amplification ratio in the two channels. With the previously calculated\ngain for the HG channel and with this amplification ratio, the gain of the LG\nchannel can be calculated.\nCherenkov events from normal observations are used to measure these gain\nratios. Using nominal gains, approximate pixel charges are determined and\npixels with charges in the overlap regime are selected. The mean ratio of the\npedestal-subtracted ADC counts in both channels for these selected events is\nused to estimate the amplification ratio for each pixel.\nThe gain ratios for all cameras are given in Table 1. The mean ratios are\naround 13.5 (with RMS \u223c 0.5). The slight differences are due to the gain\ndispersion of the amplifiers.\n7 Flat-field coefficients\nDifferent photocathode efficiencies and different Winston cone light collection\nefficiencies [2] produce some inhomogeneity in the camera. Thus, even after\nthe calibration of the electronic chain, channels exhibit a slightly different\nresponse to a uniform illumination. Flat-field coefficients (FF ) are used to\ncorrect for these differences.\nThe flat-field coefficients are determined from special flat-field runs (taken\nroughly every 2 days) which use LED flashers [11] mounted on the telescope\ndishes at 15 m from the cameras to provide uniform illumination. The flashers\nproduce short pulses (FWHM of 5 ns) with uniform illumination out to 10\u25e6\n(bigger than the angular size of the camera). The wavelength range of these\n17\npulses is 390 to 420 nm, around the wavelength of PMT peak quantum effi-\nciency. The pulse intensity is stable within 5% RMS and can be adjusted by\nthe use of 5 different neutral density filters, giving an operating range of 10\nto 200 p.e. The camera is triggered in the same way as for Cherenkov showers\nbut with an increased pixel multiplicity (>9 pixels) to reduce the background\nof air-showers.\nFlat-field coefficients are extracted from flat-field run data using calibrated\namplitudes without the FF correction. For each event the mean signal over\neach camera is calculated, excluding unusable pixels (determined as described\nin the Section 9). The ratio of each pixel signal to this mean signal is accumu-\nlated in a histogram. The mean of this ratio over the run gives the efficiency\nof each pixel relative to the camera mean. The inverse of this mean value,\nthe flat-field coefficient (FF ), is used to correct for pixel efficiency differences.\nBy definition, the mean FF is equal to 1. The distribution of flat-field coeffi-\ncients gives an estimate of the uniformity of each camera. As can be seen from\nTable 1, the typical RMS of the FF distribution is \u2248 10%.\n8 Stability of calibration parameters\n8.1 Stability within a lunar cycle\nIt is expected that the calibration coefficients are stable over periods of weeks\nif the PMT high voltage is not changed. During each observation period (cor-\nresponding to a lunar cycle) several measurements of each calibration value\nare made for every pixel. The RMS variation of these measurements is used\nto characterise the stability of the calibration parameters. The values of the\nRMS variation of parameters, averaged over all channels of a camera, are\nsummarised in Table 2 for the January 2004 period (during which no HV ad-\njustments were made). As expected, all calibration parameters were stable at\nthe few percent level during this period for all cameras.\nTelescope CT 1 CT 2 CT 3 CT 4\n\u03b3ADCe : average RMS variation 2.1% 3.4% 3.6% 3.4%\nHG\/LG: average RMS variation 1.4% 1.2% 1.2% 1.2%\nFF : average RMS variation 0.8% 0.9% 0.8% 1.0%\nTable 2\nSummary of the stability of calibration parameters in the January moon cycle of\n2004. Shown is the RMS variation in time of the different parameters; the RMS\nvalues are averaged over all channels of a camera.\n18\nThe majority of calibration coefficients are affected by changes to the PMTHV.\nThe PMT gains are proportional to V \u03b1, with \u03b1 \u2248 5.2. The flat-field coefficients\nare also a function of HV via the collection efficiency of PMTs (collection\nefficiency of electrons between the photo-cathode and the first dynode). Only\nthe gain ratio of the two electronics channels is independent of HV. A complete\nre-calibration is therefore required when HV adjustments are made (roughly\nevery 3-6 months).\n8.2 Merging of calibration parameters\nGiven the stability of calibration parameters on the time-scale of weeks it is\nreasonable to merge values taken during stable periods to improve the accuracy\nof the calibration parameters. The reasons for this merging are as follows. In\na single calibration run there are typically a few pixels which are not well\nmeasured due to one of the problems described in Section 9. The merging\nalso reduces the statistical error on the final coefficients measurements, and\nensures that remaining systematic effects such as temperature dependencies\nare much reduced.\nThe first step of the merging process is to identify periods with constant HV\nsettings during at most one lunar cycle. If the PMT HV has been adjusted\nduring a lunar cycle (to compensate for the decreased gain caused by PMT\naging), two calibration periods are created around the HV change. A summary\nof the merged parameter values within each camera is given in Table 1 for the\nJanuary 2004 calibration period.\nSeveral precautions are taken to ensure the reliability of the merged values.\nPixels which experience problems within calibration runs are identified using\nthe techniques described in Section 9. In addition calibration runs with a\ntemperature drift of more than 0.5\u25e6 C are excluded from the merging to guard\nagainst biases introduced by ADC pedestal drifts.\n8.3 Long term variations of calibration parameters\nOn time-scales longer than one month, the effects of PMT aging and possibly\nmirror degradation may become apparent. Figure 10 shows the evolution of\nPMT gain over 1 year. The mean gain of each camera is shown for each dark\nmoon period. The general trend is for gains to decrease with time until a HV\nadjustment is made. The high voltages were increased for CT2 in October and\nDecember 2003, for CT4 in November and for CT3 in December.\nThe HG\/LG ratios do not depend on PMT HV and are expected to be stable.\n19\nMonth\nFeb\/03 Apr\/03 Jun\/03 Aug\/03 Oct\/03 Dec\/03 Feb\/04\nA\nD\nC \n\/ p\n.e\n.\n50\n55\n60\n65\n70\n75\n80\n85\n90\n95\n100\nCT 1\nCT 2\nCT 3\nCT 4\nCT 2 CT 4\nCT 2\nCT 3\nFig. 10.

As a consequence, the HG\nchannel gains and gain ratios of January 2004 are not directly comparable\nwith earlier periods.\n9 Identification of unusable channels\nIn any given run, there are typically a few pixels with characteristics that\nmake them unsuitable for use in Cherenkov image analysis. In such cases it\nmay be possible to use the other gain channel to calculate the signal amplitude\n(depending on its value).\n9.1 Missing calibration coefficients\nAs described in section 8, pixel calibration coefficients are merged (averaged)\nfor periods in which the pixel gains are considered stable. Even after this\nmerging process a small number of pixels do not have useful calibration coeffi-\n20\nMonth\nFeb\/03 Apr\/03 Jun\/03 Aug\/03 Oct\/03 Dec\/03 Feb\/04\nH\nig\nh \nG\nai\nn \n\/ L\now\n G\nai\nn\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\nCT 1\nCT 2\nCT 3\nCT 4\nFig. 11.

The affected gain channels of such pixels are\nexcluded from the analysis.\n9.2 Failure to synchronise the analogue memory\nWhen an ARS works properly, the signals of the four associated channels are\ncentred in the readout window of 16 ns. The integrated signal of such channels\nis at maximum. When an ARS is unlocked, the readout window is misplaced\nbecause of timing problems in the window positioning and the integrated signal\nis low and unpredictable. As a consequence, the four channels served by this\nARS are not usable.\nThis problem appears randomly on the ARSs every time the power is switched\non. For a given camera and gain channel the number of unlocked ARSs ranges\nfrom 1-5. Since the high-gain and low-gain channels of a pixel are read out\nby different ARSs (see Figure 2), it is, however, rare for both the HG and LG\nchannels of a single pixel to be unlocked. An estimate of signal amplitude is\ntherefore usually still available for these channels.\nThe distribution of the charge ratio between channels used in the determi-\nnation of the amplification ratio is also used to identify unlocked ARSs. If\none of the gain channels of a pixel is unlocked, the mean signal of the cor-\n21\nresponding channel is less than expected and the signal ratio distribution is\nmodified. The RMS of the signal ratio is increased and the mean value differs\nfrom the merged gain ratio of this period (see Section 10). The RMS and the\ndistribution shape are used to flag the probably unlocked channels. An ARS is\nflagged as unlocked if at least two pixels from four have such amplitude ratio\nbehaviour. Sample amplitude-ratio histograms are presented in Figure 12 for\npixels with locked and unlocked ARSs.\nEntries  2437\nMean   0.002661\nRMS    0.05751\nlog10(HG\/LG)\n-2 -1.5 -1 -0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 2\nEn\ntr\nie\ns\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\nFig. 12.

The distribution\nis the logarithm of the ratio of the charges calculated from the high and low gain\nchannels in the range 15-150 p.e. The nominal value of this parameter is 0.\n9.3 Other pixel problems\nThe pixel high voltage monitoring information is taken at a rate of \u223c 2 Hz.\nPixels with any deviation during a run of greater than 10 V are excluded from\nthe analysis.\nPixels with a very low frequency of large signals (> 30 p.e.) are also excluded.\nSuch pixels may have a broken PMT base or a damaged photo-cathode. Pix-\nels with a very high frequency of signals above the same threshold are also\nexcluded, bit errors in the digital cards of drawers are suspected in this case.\nIn addition to pixels with hardware problems there are typically a few pixels\n22\nin every field-of-view that are affected by bright stars. One of the techniques\ndescribed in Section 5 is used to identify these pixels.\nThese additional hardware problems occur at the < 1% level.\n9.4 Summary of channel problems\nTable 3 summarises the mean number of channels that are considered un-\nusable out of the 1920 electronics channels of each camera in January 2004.\nThis table illustrates that only a small fraction of pixels are unusable during\nobservations: less than 2% of the LG and HG channels have an unlocked ARS\nand less than 0.1% of the channels have other hardware problems. The lack\nof calibration coefficients affects less than 2% of the channels. The fraction of\nunused channels per run is then of the order of 3% to 4%. The mean fraction\nof images where a pixel is completely missing due to hardware problems is\n1-2%.\nTelescope CT 1 CT 2 CT 3 CT 4\nLack of coefficients 11 13 23 22\nUnlocked HG ARS 6.2 10.6 8.2 13.5\nUnlocked LG ARS 15.6 13.1 13.6 18.0\nHardware problem 0.4 0.9 2.3 0.4\nNoisy pixels (Electronics) 4.4 0.8 1.1 3.0\nTable 3\nSummary of identified pixels problem. These number are the average number of\nchannels with problems (HG or LG) in January 2004. There are 1920 channels in\ntotal in each camera.\n9.5 Choice of the channel\nThe pixel amplitude used in the analysis may be based on the high gain\nADC value or the low gain value or a combination of both, as discussed in\nSection 2.3. The choice of the channel to be used for a pixel depends on the\namplitude of each channel and the existence of any identified problems with\none of the gain channels. Normally, the HG channel is always preferred for\nintensities below 150 p.e. and the LG channel above 200 p.e. However, in the\ncase of an unusable HG channel the LG channel is used down to 15 p.e. In the\ncase of an unusable LG channel, the HG channel is used up to 200 p.e.\nIf a pixel has no usable channel, or has a signal amplitude outside of the linear\n23\nrange of its only available channel, its signal is set to 0 p.e. As mentioned in\nSection 6.2, if no high gain (\u03b3ADCe ) is avaible, flat-fielding coefficient compen-\nsate for any deviation from the nominal gain and then the pixel is usable. But,\nif no high gain (\u03b3ADCe ) and no flat-fielding coefficient are available, the pixel is\ncompletely excluded. If no gain ratio is available, only the high gain channel\nis used.\n10 Accuracy of calibration parameters\n10.1 Pedestal position\nAs described in Section 4, the ADC pedestal positions depend on temperature.\nThey must therefore be calculated as frequently as possible to avoid base-line\ndrifts. To verify that the calculation frequency is high enough, a method has\nbeen developed to measure the accuracy of the pedestal positions.\nA typical Cherenkov image involves only \u223c20 camera pixels. The remaining\n98% of the camera measures only NSB around the pedestal position. Pixels\nwhich are not found in a cluster after tail cuts (see [12,10] for a description\nof tail cuts technique), are considered to be unaffected by Cherenkov light.\nThe mean amplitude of pixels selected in this way gives an estimate of the\npedestal position. The precision of the pedestal position can be estimated by\ncomparing this value with the previously estimated position.\nThis method has been applied to an observation run with a large tempera-\nture variation (amplitude of the order of 1\u25e6C). The average residual amplitude\nover the camera is calculated for each new pedestal. This average is constant\nin time and is around 0.05 p.e. The residual RMS across the camera is around\n0.03 p.e. We can conclude that measurements of the high gain pedestal posi-\ntion are frequent enough and are accurate at the level of 0.05 p.e.\nTwo independent methods have been developed to compute the pedestal po-\nsitions and calibration parameters. Concerning the pedestal evaluation, the\ndifferences consist mainly of different techniques for rejection of Cherenkov\nevents. A comparison of these two methods provides a second estimate of the\npedestal position accuracy. Table 4 gives the means and RMS of the differ-\nences of the pedestal positions for both channels of each pixel during one run\nin January 2004. The differences are given in photoelectrons. The two meth-\nods agree within 0.1 p.e. in the high gain channel and 0.5 p.e. in the low gain\nchannel.\n24\nTelescope CT 1 CT 2 CT 3 CT 4\nHG: mean -0.02 -0.03 -0.01 -0.01\nRMS 0.08 0.03 0.06 0.13\nLG: mean -0.03 -0.15 -0.02 -0.06\nRMS 0.38 0.17 0.49 0.36\nTable 4\nSummary of the differences between two methods to estimate channel pedestal.\nShown are the mean and RMS of the difference over all channels of a camera, in\nunits of photoelectrons.\n10.2 Comparison of merged coefficients between independent calibrations\nAs was done for the pedestals, two independent approaches have been devel-\noped to derive the other calibration coefficients. The implementation details\nof the two calibration schemes differ, but the methods described in this paper\nare used in both. The differences are the adjustment or not of the normalisa-\ntion parameter for the determination of \u03b3ADCe and a different event selection\nbased on their amplitudes for the determination of FF and HG\/LG coeffi-\ncients. Table 5 gives the mean and RMS of the differences pixel to pixel of the\ncalibration coefficients for a period in January 2004. The results are given as\na percentage and show good agreement between the different schemes.\nThe most crucial calibration factor is the conversion factor from pedestal-\nsubtracted high gain ADC counts to effective photoelectrons: \u03b3ADCe \/FF . The\nRMS differences between the independent schemes for this quantity are < 4%.\nFor the ratio of the two gain channels HG\/LG the different schemes agree at\na similar level.\n10.3 Verification of the flat-field coefficient calculation\nTo check the calculation and merging of flat-field coefficients, these coefficients\nare recalculated after application of the merged coefficients to the charge cal-\nculation. The newly calculated coefficients should be close to 1.0 and provide\nan estimate of the coefficient uncertainty.\nFor an example run taken in January the recalculated flat-field coefficients\ndistributions are Gaussian and their RMS are (0.006, 0.006, 0.01, 0.008), re-\nspectively, for CT1, CT2, CT3 and CT4, implying an accuracy of < 1%.\nA completely independent estimate of flat-field coefficients can be made using\n25\nTelescope CT 1 CT 2 CT 3 CT 4\n\u03b3ADCe : mean 1.1% -2.0% -0.5% -1.8%\nRMS 2.7% 3.0% 2.5% 2.8%\nFlat-field: mean 0.3% 0.4% -0.2% 0.0%\nRMS 3.0% 4.0% 5.4% 2.9%\n\u03b3ADCe \/FF : mean 0.8% -2.4% -0.8% -1.9%\nRMS 2.4% 1.1% 3.2% 1.1%\nHG\/LG: mean 0.1% -1.9% -1.5% -2.2%\nRMS 2.0% 0.8% 2.6% 1.2%\nTable 5\nSummary of the differences between two calibration schemes, for the calibration co-\nefficients of every pixel. Shown are the mean and RMS of the difference distribution\nover pixels in a camera, given in percentage.\nmuon ring images. As the Cherenkov emission of single muons is very well\nunderstood, it is possible to accurately predict the charge distribution and\nshape of the muon rings observed. For each muon ring, the particular geome-\ntrical parameters (impact distance, arrival angle, . . . ) are fit to the image. The\nratio of the actual and expected charges gives an estimate of the efficiency of\nevery pixel on the ring. This method is described in detail in [13] and produces\nFF coefficients that agree with the standard calculation at the few percent\nlevel. This level of agreement is encouraging given the completely different\nsystematic errors associated with this independent method.\n10.4 Comparison of unusable channels\nComparisons of unusable channels have also been made between the two cal-\nibration techniques. Except for one or two channels per camera, the identi-\nfied unlocked ARSs are identical. Concerning the other types of problems, the\nagreement is generally good, in spite of different methods for unusable channel\nidentification.\n11 Summary\nElaborate calibration procedures have been developed and implemented for\nthe four cameras of the H.E.S.S. detector. The calibration algorithms and\nthe monitoring of calibration coefficients monitoring are automated and their\n26\nresults are used in the standard data analysis. Two independent calibration\nschemes are available and are in good agreement. The flat-field coefficients\nhave been evaluated by a different method using muon rings [13] and they are\nin agreement with the standard coefficients. In conclusion, the calibration of\ncameras appears to be robust and accurate.\nPixel amplitudes in units of effective (flat-fielded) photoelectrons should be\naccurate, for the usual amplitudes, within a pedestal error of less than 0.1 p.e.\nand a linear error of less than 5%, including systematic uncertainties intro-\nduced by the required assumptions about the exact shape of the amplitude\ndistributions of single photoelectrons, relevant for the gain calibration. The\nstatistical uncertainties are negligible compared to the systematic ones be-\ncause of the high number of calibration runs and the high number of events.\nThe camera calibration does not provide the final absolute calibration of the\nH.E.S.S. detector, which includes the reflectivity of the mirrors and Winston\ncones and the absolute quantum efficiency of the PMTs. The absolute calibra-\ntion can either be based on laboratory measurements of these quantities or\non the use of muon rings; the latter approach will be presented in a separate\npaper. Moreover, the behaviour of the camera trigger has to be understood\ncorrectly in order to estimate the gamma ray detection rates. This is achieved\nusing detailed simulations of air showers in atmosphere and of the detector,\nwhich will be described elsewhere in detail. The overall quality of the current\nunderstanding of the full calibration of the H.E.S.S. instrument is illustrated\nin Figure 13, where the flux determined for the Crab Nebula is compared with\nearlier measurements and where excellent agreement is found.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to acknowledge the support of their host institutions,\nand additionally support from the German Ministry for Education and Re-\nsearch (BMBF), the French Ministry for Research, the Astroparticle Interdis-\nciplinary Programme of the CNRS, the U.K. Particle Physics and Astronomy\nResearch Council, the IPNP of the Charles University and the South African\nDepartment of Science and Technology and National Research Foundation.
