INTRODUCTION\nRecent developments in aviation manufacturer and avionics \nequipment maintenance communities have highlighted a major \noversight in electrical wire testing. This applies to the \nmaintenance of aging aircraft [1, 2] as well as the design of \nnovel types of aircraft. In addition, we have recently witnessed \na drive for a more reliable and safe air travel. In normal \nmaintenance regime of an aircraft safety costs a lot of \nmaintenance man-hours and in the case of wiring testing this \nbecomes a very costly procedure. In US military aviation alone \nthe wire testing and maintenance takes 1 million man-hours per \nyear with a bill of $10M for replacements [3]. Oversight during \nthis maintenance led to aborting of 1400 missions per year.  \nThe problem is therefore real and requires a systematic \napproach. According to the survey for US military aircraft, just \nconnectors and conductors alone contributed to 14% and 29% \nof incidents respectively. When the faults were identified, it \nturned out that chaffed wire insulation, wire short circuits and \nbroken wires contributed to 37%, 18% and 11% of incidents \nrespectively. Even though relatively few of wiring faults lead \nto disasters, they contribute to the down time of aircraft. \nSurprisingly, even to date most of the wiring inspections are \nperformed visually. This is not only a laborious task but is also \nnot a very reliable one. There is a large selection of more \nreliable testing methods such as reflectometry (frequency and \ntime-domain) [4] or resistance or peak voltage tests. But most \nof these advanced techniques lack the ability to detect \nmechanical (not electrical) faults. Such mechanical faults \nusually lead to electrical failure thus making these techniques \npreventative. Another problem is to detect and identify \nintermittent faults that are undetectable when the aircraft is not \nin use.  \nWe propose to use acoustic (mechanical) means of testing \nthe integrity of structures and will concentrate on our \nsimulation and experimental results. This paper aims to take \nthe original ideas by Anastasi [5] further in order to quantify \nthe merits of the acoustic wire testing [6]. This work extends \nthe range of acoustic signal propagation as well as introduces a \ntime-domain detection of a crack in a wire system. We \ndescribe our modelling results and show that a detectable \nsignal for a simplified metal rod with insulation works very \nwell. Modelling section is followed by the experimental results \nwhere we demonstrate a clear detectable signal from a defect in \ninsulation. \n2. PROPOSED METHODS \nThe advantage of acoustic testing method is that it uses \nmechanical stimuli instead of the traditional electrical signals, \nthus it could be applied online while the wires are operating, \nwhich means that finding intermittent faults becomes possible. \nIt also provides the capability of monitoring the insulator layer \nas well as the conductors. \nWe propose to send an acoustic signal through the wire. The \nmechanical imperfections, defects and faults are to be detected \nthough measurements of transmitted and reflected signals. \nFigure 1 shows the proposed structure. The key components \nare pairs of piezoelectric acoustic transducers. These \ntransducers can produce transverse and\/or longitudinal waves \nalong the rod, and are fixed onto the wire at certain distance \naway from each other. Each of the transducers can be \nconfigured as acoustic emitter or receiver independently. Two \ntypes of transducers have been proposed: the connector type \nwhich can be integrated into the conventional connectors, and \nthe clip type which could be just clamped onto a wire. The \nconnector type has advantage of injecting acoustic testing \nsignal directly into the conductor of the wire. It is much more \nefficient on transmitting signals compared with the clip type, as \nthe insulator layer of the wire is a poor acoustic conductor. \nWhile on the other hand, the clip type is more sensitive to the \ndefects which exist only in wire insulation. \nConnector type Clip type \nTraditional\nconnector \nWire under test \nFig. 1.

Restrictions apply.\nDefect detection can be achieved by locking at spectral \nsignatures of the transmitted signal or by simply comparing the \nsignal to a pre-stored signal for the defect-free system. There \nare two modes of test: the pulse-echo mode and the through \nmode. In the pulse-echo mode, the same transducer is used as \nthe emitter and the receiver. It firstly sends out a burst of \ntesting signals, and then records the reflection. In the through \nmode, one transducer on the wire sends out a test signal, the \nother transducer next to it is configured as receiver. \n2.1 MODELLING OF THE WIRE \nFinite element analysis has been performed to evaluate the \nfeasibility of acoustic wire testing method. A model of the \nMIL-W-81381\/7 Gauge 20 has been built as shown in figure 2. \nThe wire has polyimide insulator (internal diameter=0.942mm, \noutside diameter=1.286mm). As shown by figure 2, a stress \nwave has been applied on one end of the conductor as the test \ninput. The stress wave is injected at the input end into the \nconductor. The acoustic signal travels through the structure, \nbut the output is detected from the surface of insulation layer \nand from the conductor that was originally stimulated. A small \ncrack in the insulator layer is also added in the middle of the \nwire. The width of the crack is 0.2mm and the depth changes \nfrom 0 to the full thickness of the insulator. \nThe attenuation of an acoustic wave is normally proportional \nto the square of its carrier frequency, thus the frequency of the \ninput test signal (f) needs to be chosen carefully. If f is too low, \nthe wavelength of the stress wave will be big and non \ncomparable to the crack size, thus no defect could be detected. \nHowever, if f is too high, the attenuation of the signal will be \nstrong, especially in flexible material like the insulator. In this \ncase frequency of 1 MHz is used. \n2.2 SIMULATION OF PULSE-ECHO MODE\nIn this measurement a test signal of a burst is applied at the \nconductor input end (figure 2), and the reflection is monitor at \nthe same position. The burst is a shifted and scaled Morlet \nwave, defined by equation 1. \nWhen 5104.60 \u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004 t\nWhen \nwhere \n5104.6 \u0001\u0002\u0005t\n41025.1 5 \u0001\u0002\u0002\u0006 tx                                                        (1) \nIn equation 1 A is the amplitude of the input signal, A0 is the \nmagnitude, e is the Napier's constant and t is the time. Figure 3  \nshows a burst of the normalized input signal. \nFig. 3.  Normalized burst input. \nFully cut crack in the insulator at 2 different positions are \nsimulated. The reflections received from the defect wire are \ncompared to the recorded reflection of a healthy wire. Figure 4 \nshows the differences of the displacement output between \ndefect and healthy wires. It is clear that the arriving time of the \ndifferences indicates the location of the crack. \n2.3 SIMULATION OF THROUGH MODE\nIn the simulation of through mode, the location of the crack \nis fixed in the middle of the wire. The depth changes from 1\/6 \nto the full thickness of the insulator layer. The input testing \nsignal in this case is a continues sine wave at frequency of \n1MHz. The displacement and stress at the insulator output end \nis monitored and compared to the healthy state. Figure 5 shows \nthe Fast Fourier Transfer (FFT) result of the displacement \noutput, with a crack of 0.2mm wide and half thickness cut of \nthe insulator layer. It is clear that the defect can be indicated by \nthe major peak at 1 MHz. Figure 5 indicates that the carrier \nfrequency has higher transmission in the case of healthy wire. \nCracked wire however seemed to enhance the transmission of \nfrequency side bands. \n\u0007\b\n\u0007\n\t\n\n\n\u0006\n\u0001\n0\n)5cos(2\/0\n2\nxeAA\nx\nFig. 4.

EXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND MEASUREMENTS OF THROUGH \nMODE\nA through mode experimental setup is constructed to \ncompare the simulation result described in section 2.3. In the \nexperiment, we have used off the shelf components \n(transducer) and test structures (steel rod and heat shrink coat) \nas an initial setup. Instead of real wire, we have used steel rod \nas the core of the wire and heat shrink insulation as the \ncladding of the wire.  \nThe attenuation of the acoustic wave is very high in \ninsulation and increases significantly with frequency for both \nsteel and insulation. So a relatively low frequency (500 KHz) \npiezoelectric transducers (Panametrics NDT V151 0.5MHz) \nwere chosen for the experiment. In the measurement setup, one \ntransducer works as an emitter and a second transducer works \nas a receiver as shown in Figure 6.  Each transducer can work \nas both emitter and receiver. The emitting transducer is placed \ndirectly in contact with the steel rod and the receiving \ntransducer is placed on the insulation. Both transducers are \nidentical and operate in transverse wave propagation mode. \nThe distance between the transducers is 14 cm and the \ndiameter of the steel rod used as core is 6 mm. The thickness of \nthe heat shrink insulation (polyolefin) used as cladding is 0.5 \nmm.   \nFig. 6.  The through mode measurement setup. The transducers are in \ntransverse mode and 14 cm apart. The emitting transducer is on the steel and \nthe receiving transducer is on the insulation. A full cut is introduced in the \ninsulation.\n0\n0.005\n0.01\n0.015\n0.02\n4.8 105 4.9 105\nFrequency response in transverse mode\nNo cut\n A scratch\nA round cut\nA long round cut\nO\nut\npu\nt r\nm\ns \n(v\n)\nFrequency (Hz)\nFig. 5.  Transmitted signal FFT for healthy and cracked insulation wires \nFig. 7.   The rms value of the received signal with various type of cut on the \ninsulation. The transmit transducer is on steel and receive transducer is on \ninsulation.\nA 1 V peak-to-peak alternating current (AC) signal is \napplied to the emitting transducer. The frequency of the \nemitting signal is varied from 450 KHz to 600 KHz. The \nacoustic transverse wave propagates through the steel rod and \ninsulation. The receiving transducer, placed on insulation, \ndetects mechanical vibration. A Tektronics AFG3022 dual \nchannel arbitrary function signal generator is used to generate \nthe test signal. An HP54645A 200MSa\/s oscilloscope is used \nto monitor the received signal. Both signal generator and \noscilloscope are controlled by a PC running Labview program \nand interface. The root mean square (rms) value of the signal \nobtained from receiving transducer is measured and compared \nfor various types of insulation cuts. The comparison is shown \nby Figure 7.  In Figure 7, No cut means, the insulation is in \ngood condition, A scratch means, a scratch is introduced in the \ninsulation by knife, A Round cut means, a 2 mm wide cut is \nintroduced in the insulation around the rod (shown in Fig. 6) \nand A Long round cut means, a 1 cm wide cut is introduced in \nthe insulation around the rod. \nFrom the measurement results, it can be seen that the signal \ntransmission increases with the increase in the amount of cut in \nthe insulation. The transverse wave transmission is very \nsensitive to the insulation and absorbed significantly during \npropagation through the rod. So by comparing the received \nsignal strength of a test wire with a healthy wire, we can detect \na cut or crack in the wire.   \nInsulation Receiver\ncut\nEmitter \n4. CONCLUSION\nTo summarize, we have proposed an acoustic online wire \ntesting system.

The experiment results \nshow that a system with larger insulation break transmits \nacoustic signals better than the healthy wire. This wire testing \nmethod is therefore applicable to more complex systems \nonboard of aircraft, due to its sensitivity and relative \nsimplicity. \nReferences \n1.
