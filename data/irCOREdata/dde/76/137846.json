Introduction \n \nDrainflow in structured clay soils with a potential for bypass flow is an important \nmechanism for the movement of diffusely applied pesticides to surface waters. An \nunderstanding of the mechanisms that control pesticide behaviour in such soils is \nessential for the development of practices that reduce pesticide leaching. There is \nincreasing evidence that chemicals become less available for uptake and transformation \nby soil organisms the longer their residence time in soil (Alexander, 1995; Scow and \nJohnson, 1997). The availability of chemicals for soil organisms and the potential of a \nchemical to leach to groundwater or surface waters often decline with time (Pignatello \net al., 1993, Walker et al., 2003, Renaud et al., 2004). Work at the field scale showed \nthat losses of some, but not all pesticides from a cracking clay soil decreased with \nincreasing time from application to first drainflow event (Jones et al., 2000). Losses of \nthe moderately mobile, moderately persistent herbicide isoproturon in drainflow \ninitiated 10 days after application were four orders of magnitude larger than those in \ndrainflow initiated 110 days after application. This decline in isoproturon losses was \nfaster than could be explained by degradation alone. In contrast, the effect of residence \ntime on leaching of the weakly sorbed herbicide triasulfuron was not significant.  \n 2\n The decline in pesticide bioavailability and its potential for leaching to depth with \nincreasing time of contact with soil are likely to be caused by slow sorption kinetics \nand\/or diffusion. Desorption often occurs more slowly than adsorption and may not be \nfully reversible (Pignatello, 2000). Diffusion may be a limiting factor during (a) \nmovement of pesticide through bulk aqueous solution to the surfaces of sorbing \nmaterials; (b) movement in solution through micropores to areas protected from the \nmain regions of soil water flow; and (c) movement through the three dimensional \nnetwork of organic material. Diffusion in soil is slow relative to that in water due to the \ntortuosity and increased length of the flow path within soil particles, sorption to pore \nwalls, steric interference from pore walls and the viscous nature of water near \nhydrophilic surfaces (Pignatello, 2000). Reactions between the pesticide and the sorbent \nmay also be time-dependent. The distribution between the dissolved and sorbed state \nmay thus require days, weeks or even months to reach equilibrium (Cox and Walker, \n1999; Koskinen et al., 2002). A depletion of the readily available fraction of pesticide \nby degradation, uptake into soil organisms and plants or leaching to depth results in a \nshift in pesticide distribution towards the unavailable state. Further losses may be \nlimited by the rate of mass-transfer from the unavailable to the available state.  \n \nTo date, there is no clear understanding of how slow sorption and diffusion influence \nmass transfer in complex, structured soils under different environmental conditions. The \ninfluence of temperature and moisture on the mass transfer of solutes is particularly \ncomplex (Delle Site, 2001).  Solubility of the compound in water, transport to the \nbinding sites via diffusion and chemical sorption reactions are enhanced at higher \ntemperatures. In contrast, physical sorption is decreased due to its exothermic nature. \n 3\nDesorption usually requires energy and may be enhanced at higher temperature. The \ninfluence of soil water content on pesticide sorption depends strongly on the properties \nof the pesticide (Roy et al., 2000). The structure of humic substances is modified and \nsurfaces become more hydrophobic at low soil moisture contents which favours \nsorption of hydrophobic pesticides. In contrast, hydrophilic compounds, are often more \nstrongly sorbed at high soil moisture content due to their higher affinity for hydrophilic \nregions of humus. Water is the medium in which pesticide molecules diffuse to binding \nsites within the aggregates. Mass-transfer of pesticides is thus expected to be faster in \nwet soils. In work by Gaillardon and Dur (1995), sorption of diuron and isoproturon \nwas only stronger in dry than wet soil up to 30 min from application. Thereafter, \nsorption was stronger in wet soil, probably due to faster diffusion.  \n \nSoil moisture at the time of pesticide treatment is also expected to influence pesticide \navailability for leaching. Application to relatively dry soil may result in advective \nmovement of pesticide into soil aggregates where it is protected from leaching. \nApplication to wet soil is likely to initially concentrate the pesticide in the outer regions \nof soil aggregates. More pesticide may thus be available for leaching after application to \nwet soil. \n \nThe distribution of a chemical between the readily available and protected state is \ninfluenced by the rate of degradation in relation to the rate of slow sorption or diffusion. \nPatterns of spatial distribution of soil microorganisms suggest that degradation occurs \nmainly at surfaces or in outer layers of soil aggregates (Scow and Johnson, 1997). \nDegradation of many compounds appears to be largely restricted to the fraction \navailable in the soil solution (Ogram et al., 1985; Rijnaarts et al., 1990). Pesticide which \n 4\nis either sorbed or held in micropores which are inaccessible for degrading \nmicroorganisms may be protected from degradation. Faster degradation at higher \ntemperatures and in wetter soils is thus likely to result in faster depletion of the fraction \nof the pesticide readily available for leaching.  \n \nThe aim of the study reported here was to test the following hypotheses: \n1. The concentration of solutes in readily extractable pore water and their \navailability for leaching decreases with increasing residence time in soil. \n2. The decline is faster than can be explained by degradation alone. \n3. The decline is more pronounced for sorbing compounds than for weakly or non-\nsorbing compounds. \n4. The decline is more pronounced under conditions that favour degradation. \n5. More pesticide will be available for leaching after application to wet soil \ncompared with application to dry soil. \nThe laboratory study investigated leaching of solutes with contrasting degradation and \nsorption properties at different times from application in relation to temperature and \nantecedent moisture conditions. At each sampling interval, soil water was extracted \nfrom parallel samples by a centrifugation technique in order to characterise the fraction \nof chemical available in soil water under natural moisture conditions. The total amount \nof chemical remaining in the soil was also measured. \n \n2. Material and methods \n \nThree experiments were carried out. The behaviour of a non-degrading, non-sorbing \nsolute (bromide) was investigated in the first study. The second experiment assessed the \n 5\nbehaviour of the pesticides chlorotoloron, isoproturon and triasulfuron at two \ntemperatures. In a third experiment, initially dry and initially wet aggregates of the same \nsoil were treated with isoproturon in order to assess the influence of soil moisture status \nat the time of application. \n \n2.1. Soil  \n \nA heavy clay soil (Lawford series; 55% clay, 3.6% organic carbon, pH (H2O) 6.4) was \nused for this study. The soil was taken from the upper 10 cm of an agricultural field and \nsoil aggregates with diameters of 3-6 mm were isolated by passing through a 3-mm and \na 6-mm sieve. Soil used for the three experiments was taken from the same location, but \nat different times within the year. Field capacity was measured prior to the experiments. \nAggregates were filled into metal rings (2.0 cm in height, 5.4 cm in diameter). Four \nreplicate samples were saturated and then equilibrated on a sand table at a tension of \n50 cm generated by a hanging water column. Water contents were determined by \nweighing the samples before and after drying at 105oC over night.  \n \n2.2. Pesticides  \n \nThe herbicides chlorotoloron (CT), isoproturon (IPU) and triasulfuron (TSU) were studied \n(Table 1). Commercial formulations of the three herbicides were used. All pesticide \nconcentrations reported in this paper are expressed as active substance. Sorption of the three \npesticides was measured in the Lawford soil by Renaud et al. (2004). \n  \n 6\n2.3. Experimental methodology \n \nDetails of the three experiments are given in Table 2. For all studies, aggregates of the \nLawford soil were filled into glass petri dishes. Separate sets of dishes were prepared \nfor the leaching experiment, extraction of readily available soil water and the extraction \nof total residues. Each replicate sample for the leaching study consisted of 10 g dry \nweight soil filled into petri dishes of 80 mm diameter. Additional samples (80 mm \ndishes, 10 g soil) were prepared for the extraction of soil pore water. Larger amounts of \nsoil were used for the degradation study (20 g or 25 g) and these were placed into dishes \nwith a diameter of 12 mm A solution of KBr or commercial formulations of the \npesticides in 5 mmol l-1 CaSO4 (0.6 ml per 10 g dry soil) was dripped onto the soil. \nPrevious experiments with a dye solution had shown that this volume of application \nsolution was sufficient to give an even distribution over the soil, which formed a single \nlayer of aggregates in the petri dishes. The solution was added to wet soil except for the \nthird experiment where isoproturon was applied either 23 hours before (\u2018initially dry\u2019) \nor 23 hours after (\u2018initially wet\u2019) adjusting soil moisture. The water content was at 90% \nfield capacity after adding the solution. The soil was transferred to incubation containers \n(see below) which were loosely covered and stored at either 5 or 15oC in the dark. \nMoisture was replenished every 1-3 days. Samples were taken at intervals (Table 2). \n \nLeaching studies \nThe soil was incubated in 50-ml plastic syringes with a centric outlet. Four replicate \nsamples were taken at each sampling interval and irrigated with a target volume of \n27.5 mm 5 mmol l-1 CaSO4 solution over 6 hours (4.6 mm hour-1) using a peristaltic \nmulti-channel pump (Watson-Marlow 205U). The irrigation volume corresponded to \n 7\napproximately three times the total volume of water held by the soil after leaching. It \nshould be noted that the soil samples used in the leaching study were not centrifuged \nbefore or after leaching. Parallel soil samples were used for this purpose. \n \nExtraction of soil pore water \nParallel samples were incubated in Whatman\u00ae Vectaspin 20 centrifugation devices \nconsisting of a 50-ml outer tube and a 20-ml insert with a perforated base covered by a \nWhatman\u00ae GF\/F 0.7 \u00b5m retention glass microfibre filter. At each sampling interval, \nfour replicate samples were centrifuged for 20 min at a speed corresponding to a tension \nof 200 kPa (experiments 1 and 2) and for 30 min at a tension of ca. 140 kPa (experiment \n3). This aimed at characterising the fraction of the soil water which is readily available \nfor transport during leaching events. Extracted soil water was collected in the outer \ntube. \n \nMeasurement of total pesticide in soil \nIn experiment 2, soil samples (20 g dry weight) were incubated in duplicate in 60-ml \nglass bottles. At each sampling interval, 20 ml acetonitrile + water + orthophosphoric \nacid (90 + 9.75 + 0.25 by volume) were added to duplicate bottles and the samples were \nshaken on a wrist-action shaker for one hour. In experiment 3, 25 g soil was extracted \nwith 25 ml acetonitrile + water (90 + 10 by volume) for one hour. After the soil had \nsettled, the supernatant was transferred into HPLC vials to determine total residues of \npesticide remaining in the soil at each sampling interval. Initial concentrations of the \ncompounds in soil were derived by extracting the soil with organic solvents 1 h after \nadding the pesticides. No significant degradation will occur within 1 h for the pesticides \nused in this study and the concentration measured at this point in time can be taken as \n 8\nthe amount applied. The concentration measured after 1 h was compared with the \ntheoretical amount calculated from the concentration of the application solution \ndetermined by HPLC and the volume applied. Recovery of the pesticides from the \nLawford soil was between 96 and 110% of the total amount added. \n \n2.4. Analytical methods \n \nBromide in leachate and soil pore water extracted by centrifugation was analysed with a \nMetrohm 790 Personal Ion Chromatograph (Herisau, Switzerland) equipped with \nMetrohm\u2019s Metrosep RP guard column, Metrosep A supp 4\/5 guard column and \nMetrosep A Supp 4 analytical column. A 20 \u00b5l injection loop and an isocratic eluent \n(1.8 mM sodium carbonate \/ 1.7 mM sodium hydrogen carbonate) were used. The limits \nof quantification and detection were 0.5 mg bromide l-1 and 0.1 mg bromide l-1, \nrespectively. \n \nFor pesticide analysis, the solution (20 \u00b5L) was injected into a DX600 (Dionex, \nSunningvale, USA) HPLC equipped with a PDA100 photodiode array detector and a \nDiscovery C-18 column (150mm long x 4.6mm i.d. 5\u00b5m particle size, Supelco, \nBellefonte, USA). The mobile phase was acetonitrile : 0.04% v\/v orthophosphoric acid \n(40:60). The flow rate of the mobile phase was 1 ml min-1 with a run time of 25 min per \nsample and the detection wavelength for all three herbicides was 200 nm. Typical \nretention times were 6.6, 7.7 and 5.9 min for chlorotoluron, isoproturon and \ntriasulfuron, respectively. Limits of quantification were 85, 70 and 25 \u00b5g l-1, \nrespectively. The limit of detection was ca. 10 \u00b5g l-1 for all three herbicides.  \n \n 9\n3. Results \n \n3.1. Volumes of water and bromide concentrations \n \nAverage volumes of irrigation, leachate and pore water extracted are given in Table 3 \nfor the three experiments. Water contents in the 10-g soil samples during incubation, \njust prior to leaching and centrifugation are also given for comparison. The soil samples \nwere irrigated with a target volume of 27.5 mm of 5 mmol CaSO4 solution which \ncorresponds to 14.1 ml. Target volumes of irrigation were exceeded for some samples \ndue to variability in flow generated by the peristaltic pump. Between 3 and 6% water \n(w\/w) was extracted from the soil samples by centrifugation.  \n \nBetween 78 and 96% of the applied bromide was leached from samples taken at \ndifferent times from application. Concentrations of bromide in leachate ranged from \n0.31 to 0.42 g l-1. These concentrations were only slightly larger than those expected \nfrom complete mixing of the applied bromide throughout the soil aggregates (0.21 - \n0.35 g l-1). Observed concentrations in leachate were independent of the residence time \nin soil. The mass of bromide extracted from parallel samples by centrifugation \ncorresponded to 12-18% of that applied. Concentrations of bromide in pore water were \nmore variable (1.34 - 1.95 g l-1) than leachate concentrations. There was no consistent \ninfluence of the time from application to sampling on bromide concentrations in pore \nwater. \n  \n 10\n3.2. Pesticide behaviour \n \nConcentrations of chlorotoluron and isoproturon in leachate and in pore water decreased \nwith time for soil incubated at 5oC whereas those of triasulfuron were almost constant at \nthis temperature (Figure 1). Leaching losses and pore water concentrations of all three \nherbicides decreased to a much larger extent in soil incubated at 15oC than at 5oC. \n \nBulk residues of isoproturon in soil declined faster than those of chlorotoluron \n(Figure 1) and both pesticides were degraded more rapidly at the higher temperature. \nAnalysis of bulk soil residues for triasulfuron indicated no significant degradation \nwithin the experimental period. However, a number of measurements for this pesticide \nwere unreliable and the results should be interpreted with care. \n \nTimes for 50% decline of concentrations of chlorotoluron and isoproturon in leachate, \npore water and bulk soil (DT50 values) were calculated by fitting an exponential curve \nto the data. Measurements for each of the four replicates were used individually and not \naveraged prior to curve-fitting. The r2 values given in Table 4 thus reflect the scatter in \nthe data as well as deviations from first-order kinetics. It should also be noted that r2 \nvalues are generally larger where the exponential curves are relatively flat (i.e. where \ndegradation is slow). This explains the relatively poor r2 values at 5oC. No DT50 values \nwere calculated for triasulfuron because a number of measurements of total soil residues \ngave unreliable results (later measurements only, initial concentrations are reliable). \n \nDT50 values for the decline in leachate and soil pore water concentrations of \nchlorotoluron at 5oC were shorter than those for the decline in total soil residues (Table \n 11\n4). At this temperature, there was only a small difference in the DT50 values for \nisoproturon concentrations in leachate, pore water or bulk soil.  \n \nDT50 values for bulk degradation at 15oC were 39.2 days for chlorotoluron and 15.2 \ndays for isoproturon. For both pesticides, leaching concentrations declined faster than \ntotal residues (DT50 values of 17.4 and 11.1 days for chlorotoluron and isoproturon, \nrespectively). DT50 values for the concentrations in pore water (12.9 days for \nchlorotoluron and 10.1 days for isoproturon) were also much shorter than those for bulk \ndegradation.  \n \nThe availability for leaching and extraction in pore water was different for the three \npesticides. The mass of pesticide that was initially available for leaching corresponded \nto 56% of the applied amount for triasulfuron (average of both incubation \ntemperatures), 37% for isoproturon and 27% for chlorotoluron. The initial mass in pore \nwater extracted was 4.1% of the applied mass of triasulfuron compared with 1.5% for \nisoproturon and 0.94% for chlorotoluron. Losses were inversely related to the strength \nof sorption as indicated by batch experiments with the Lawford soil (Renaud et al., \n2004) and were much larger for the weakly sorbed triasulfuron (Kf = 0.62 l kg-1; 1\/n = \n0.70) than for chlorotoluron (Kf = 6.40 l kg-1; 1\/n = 0.78) and isoproturon (Kf = \n3.60 l kg-1 1\/n = 0.83). \n \nConcentrations of chlorotoluron and isoproturon which were theoretically available for \nleaching assuming constant sorption with time and partitioning between the total soil \nand water volume were calculated and compared with measured concentrations. \nTheoretical concentrations for each sampling time were derived from fitted bulk \n 12\nconcentrations in soil, total volumes of water added and the sorption isotherms derived \nby Renaud et al. (2004). The results are shown in Figure 2. \n \nTheoretical values and measured concentrations decreased at the same rate at 5oC for \nboth pesticides. Measured concentrations at 15oC matched the theoretical values soon \nafter treatment, but observed concentrations were smaller than those calculated later in \nthe experiment (Figure 2). \n \nThe behaviour of isoproturon was further investigated following application to dry or \nwet soil. Moisture during subsequent incubation at 15oC was identical for both \ntreatments. Concentrations of isoproturon in leachate, soil pore water extracted by \ncentrifugation and residues of the pesticide in bulk soil decreased with time for both the \ninitially dry and wet treatments (Figure 3). There was no significant influence of \nmoisture conditions at the time of pesticide application on either measurement on most \nsampling dates.  \n \nTimes for 50% decline of the initial mass (DT50) of isoproturon in leachate, pore water \nand bulk soil were again calculated by fitting an exponential curve to the data. DT50 \nvalues for bulk degradation of isoproturon in soil were 16.1 and 17.0 days for the \ninitially dry and wet treatment, respectively. For both treatments, soil-pesticide \ninteractions reduced isoproturon loads in leachate at rates greater than expected from \ndegradation alone (DT50 = 10.6 and 10.3 days for the dry and wet treatment, \nrespectively). Times for 50% decrease in the mass of isoproturon extracted in pore \nwater (DT50 = 13.0 and 8.9 days for the dry and wet treatment, respectively) were \n 13\nsimilar to those for leaching losses. These results are very similar to those obtained for \nisoproturon in experiment 2. \n \n4. Discussion \n \nAll solutes were applied in small volumes of water in this study and would be \nconcentrated in the outer regions of soil aggregates soon after application. As time \nprogresses, the chemical is likely to move into the micropores via advection and\/or \ndiffusion. The longer the time from application to the first leaching event, the smaller \nthe concentration in the outer aggregate regions. It is likely that only the solute in the \nlarger pores and at the surface of aggregates is immediately available for leaching \nwhereas water in small pores inside the aggregates is virtually immobile (van \nGenuchten and Wierenga, 1976; Addiscott, 1977). Solute in this water is only available \nfor leaching following diffusion back into the mobile water.  \n \nWater in pores between the aggregates is displaced by infiltrating water during leaching \nevents. Once the concentration in these pores decreases below that in the micropores, \nthe direction of solute diffusion is reversed. This process is slow relative to the \nmovement of mobile soil water between soil aggregates during intense leaching events \nin the field. The time for interaction between immobile and mobile regions may thus be \ntoo short to allow an extensive redistribution of the solute and a large proportion may be \nprotected from leaching.  \n \nNon-sorbing solutes are redistributed between the inner and outer regions of aggregates \nvia advection and diffusion. Advection is relatively fast and diffusion is expected to be \n 14\nthe main rate-limiting process. Mass-transfer of pesticides is further retarded via \nsorption-desorption. An increasing number of sorption sites become available as the \npesticide slowly moves into the aggregate. Desorption may be a time-dependent process \nand often requires an activation energy (Pignatello, 2000). Movement back into mobile \nsoil water during leaching events will thus be slower for sorbing than for non-sorbing \ncompounds. \n \nObserved concentrations of bromide in leachate were slightly larger than those \ncalculated on the basis of complete mixing with the entire volume of water present in \nthe samples. This suggests that a small proportion of the soil water may have been \nexcluded from bromide diffusion, possibly due to anion exclusion. Concentrations of \nbromide in leachate and in soil pore water extracted by centrifugation were independent \nof the residence time in soil. Relatively small samples of disturbed Lawford soil were \nused in this study which resulted in short diffusion lengths and a fast distribution of \nbromide within the contributing soil volume. Renaud et al. (2004) carried out a parallel \nexperiment with undisturbed lysimeters (23.5 x 30 cm) of the same soil. The cores were \nstored outdoors for 3, 9, 24, 37 and 57 days from bromide application and then irrigated \nwith a total of 24 mm over 8 hours (2-5 mm hour-1). Concentrations of bromide in \nleachate decreased from 122 mg l-1 three days after application to 15 mg l-1 57 days after \napplication. The Lawford soil is a structured clay which is prone to preferential flow of \nwater and associated solute. The decline in bromide leaching from the lysimeters with \ntime is likely to be due to slow diffusion into soil aggregates where a fraction of the \nsolute is held away from the main regions of flow.   \n \n 15\nIn contrast to bromide, concentrations of chlorotoluron and isoproturon in leachate here \ndecreased with increasing time from application at both incubation temperatures. There \nare a number of possible reasons for this decrease. A decline in the total amount of \npesticide in soil due to degradation is likely to have contributed to the effect. For \ncompounds with non-linear sorption isotherms (i.e. Freundlich exponents < 1), the ratio \nof sorbed to dissolved pesticide is shifted towards the sorbed state at lower \nconcentrations. As a result, concentrations in soil solution may decline faster with time \nthan the total amount of the pesticide in soil. Additional possible reasons for the decline \nin leachate concentrations with time include time-dependent sorption and slow diffusion \ninto regions where the pesticide is less available for leaching. \n \nFor incubation at 5oC, the decline in leachate concentrations could mainly be attributed \nto a decline in the total mass of the pesticides in soil due to degradation and to the non-\nlinearity of the Freundlich isotherm. At 15oC, however, concentrations in leachate \ndecreased faster than expected from total residues. Initially, measured pesticide \nconcentrations in leachate matched those expected from equilibrium Freundlich sorption \nand contribution of the complete soil and water volume to leaching. Later in the \nexperiment, observed concentrations were smaller than the theoretical values. This \nsuggest that factors other than degradation and non-linear sorption have contributed to \nthe observed decline in the availability for leaching. The results for bromide suggest that \ndiffusion of free solute in pore water is not a rate-limiting factor in the relatively small \naggregates used in this study. However, pesticides are sorbed onto the pore walls and \nonly a small proportion is available for diffusion. This results in smaller concentration \ngradients and, thus, slower diffusion compared to non-sorbing compounds. In this \nsituation, diffusion may become a rate-limiting factor. Time-dependent sorption-\n 16\ndesorption of the pesticides may also be of importance. Concentrations of triasulfuron in \nleachate decreased to a lesser extent than for chlorotoluron and isoproturon. \nTriasulfuron is sorbed much more weakly than chlorotoluron and isoproturon and the \ndecline in availability for leaching was thus expected to be much less pronounced. A \nrapid decline in leaching losses of chlorotoluron, isoproturon and triasulfuron from \nundisturbed lysimeters of the Lawford soil was observed by Renaud et al. (2004). \nLosses of the herbicides declined faster than total residues in soil. In three additional \nsoils tested, triasulfuron loads were relatively constant with time whereas leaching of \nchlorotoluron and isoproturon decreased. Jones et al. (2000) found a strong decrease in \nlosses via drainflow with increasing time from application for isoproturon but not for \ntriasulfuron in a field study on a soil similar to the Lawford soil.  \n \nConcentrations in leachate declined faster than expected from constant Freundlich \nsorption at 15oC but not at 5oC for both chlorotoluron and isoproturon. Pesticides are \nlikely to be concentrated in the outer regions of soil aggregates soon after application \nand slowly move into the aggregates. Degradation by soil microrganisms occurs mainly \nin soil solution at the surface and in outer layers of soil aggregates (Scow and Johnson, \n1997). The faster decline in availability for leaching at 15oC than at 5oC is thus probably \ndue to a faster degradation of the readily available fraction at higher temperatures. This \nis in line with results from Cox and Walker (1999) who observed a stronger increase in \nsorption of linuron and isoproturon at 20oC than at 5oC. Similar effects were found by \nWalker and Jurado-Exposito (1998) for metsulfuron-methyl, but the increase in sorption \nwas independent of temperature for isoproturon and diuron.  \n \n 17\nPesticides are expected to penetrate into the aggregates through advection following \napplication to dry soil, thereby resulting in lower availability for leaching than in \ninitially wet soil. However, no significant effect of soil moisture at the time of \napplication on leaching of isoproturon was observed. Johnson et al. (1999) also found \nno effect of antecedent moisture conditions on the release of isoproturon from soil \naggregates into a bathing solution. It was hypothesised that the pesticide is prevented \nfrom moving rapidly into the aggregates due to its sorption. The pesticide will remain \nclose to the surface of soil aggregates and transport into the inner regions by advection \nis limited. Brown et al. (2001) found no significant effect of the variation in soil \nmoisture content prior to and after application upon subsequent losses of three \nherbicides to drains in a lysimeter experiment. In the current study, initially dry and wet \naggregates were adjusted to identical moisture conditions one day after application to \nthe dry soil. Results suggest that the subsequent diffusion of the pesticide to less \naccessible sorption sites inside the aggregates was independent of antecedent moisture \nconditions. \n \nThe centrifugation technique used in this study was suitable to extract water from the \nheavy clay soil. A tension of 200 kPa was applied in experiments 1 and 2. This \ncorresponds to the empirical boundary between mobile and immobile soil water selected \nby Addiscott (1977). Concentrations of the three pesticides in soil pore water declined at \na rate similar to that for concentrations in leachate. The proportion of applied substance \nthat was present in pore water was larger for the weakly sorbed triasulfuron than for \nchlorotoluron and isoproturon. Results suggests that the centrifugation technique may \nbe useful to characterise the fraction of a pesticide that is available for leaching.  \n \n 18\nThe experiments confirm several previous findings reported in the literature where \npesticide availability for leaching decreased with increasing residence time in soil. The \ndecline is often faster than can be expected from degradation alone. The shift towards \nthe non-available state is due to slow mass-transfer into and out of soil aggregates \nand\/or slow desorption. The extent of the decline in availability depends on the rate of \ndepletion of the readily available fraction by degradation and leaching events in relation \nto the rate of slow mass-transfer. It is thus influenced by pesticide properties and \nenvironmental conditions and may be greater at higher temperatures.  \n \n 19\nAcknowledgements \n \nThis work was funded by the UK Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs \n(DEFRA) under contract PL0541. \n \nReferences \n \nAddiscott, T.M., 1977.
