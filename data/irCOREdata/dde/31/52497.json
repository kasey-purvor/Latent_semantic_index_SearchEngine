In the first year-round study for any small petrel, we 17 \nexamined the activity patterns of the white-chinned petrel Procellaria aequinoctialis 18 \nbased on data from combination geolocator-immersion loggers deployed on adults at 19 \nSouth Georgia. The petrels were highly nocturnal, flying for greater proportions of 20 \ndarkness than any large procellarid studied so far, except the light-mantled albatross 21 \nPhoebetria palpebrata. Flight bout durations were short compared with other species, 22 \nsuggesting a dominant foraging mode of small-scale searching within large prey 23 \npatches. When migrating, birds reduced the proportion of time on the water and 24 \nincreased flight bout duration. Activity patterns changed seasonally: birds flew least 25 \nduring the nonbreeding period, and most frequently during chick-rearing in order to 26 \nmeet higher energy demands associated with provisioning offspring. The degree of 27 \ntheir response to moonlight was also stage dependent (greatest in nonbreeding, and 28 \nweakest in incubating birds), a trait potentially shared by other nocturnal petrels which 29 \nwill have repercussions for feeding success and prey selection. For the white-chinned 30 \npetrel, which is commonly caught in longline fisheries, these results can be used to 31 \nidentify periods when birds are most susceptible to bycatch, and therefore when use of 32 \nmitigation and checking for compliance is critical. 33 \n34 \n 3 \nIntroduction 35 \nAlthough seabirds are major consumers of marine resources, and often breed in 36 \nlarge accessible colonies, until the last few years, detailed information on behaviour of 37 \nknown individuals at sea remained elusive. Recent data-logging studies have greatly 38 \nincreased knowledge of relationships between at-sea activity patterns and species, sex, 39 \nbreeding status, prey type, foraging strategy, and the timing and use of marine habitats 40 \n(Phillips et al. 2008; Wakefield et al. 2009). Despite technological advances that have 41 \nreduced the size, mass and cost of loggers, there have been relatively few studies of the 42 \nat-sea activity of smaller procellariiform species (Catry et al. 2009; Guilford et al. 2009; 43 \nLanders et al in press; Rayner et al. 2008; Shaffer et al. 2009). 44 \nWhite-chinned petrels Procellaria aequinoctialis are medium-sized (1.3 kg)  45 \nburrow-nesting procellariiforms that breed during the austral summer on sub-Antarctic 46 \nislands throughout the Southern Ocean (Marchant and Higgins 1990). This wide-47 \nranging and opportunistic species is capable of exploiting all marine environments if 48 \nprey abundance is high (Catard et al. 2000; Phillips et al. 2006; Weimerskirch et al. 49 \n1999). White-chinned petrels travel by both gliding and flap-gliding flight, in contrast to 50 \nalbatrosses, which rely to a greater extent on the wind to sustain gliding flight; this may 51 \nallow these petrels to travel more directly (Pennycuick 1987; Weimerskirch et al. 1999). 52 \nIn addition, their smaller size and manoeuvrability results in relatively lower energetic 53 \ncosts of take-off, potentially enabling them to adopt a foraging mode involving frequent 54 \nlandings on the water (Weimerskirch et al. 2000a).  55 \nWhite-chinned petrels can reach depths up to 12m (Huin 1994), and feed on 56 \neuphausiids, fish and squid (Berrow et al. 2000a, Catard et al. 2000). Their diet and 57 \ndistribution overlap considerably with several of the smaller Southern Ocean albatrosses 58 \n(Phillips et al. 2005). However, unlike albatrosses that actively seek and capture most 59 \nprey during the day throughout the year (Mackley et al. 2010; Phalan et al. 2007), 60 \n 4 \nwhite-chinned petrels appear to show high nocturnal activity, e.g. 49% of feeding events 61 \nobserved at sea by Harper (1987) were during darkness. Ship-based observations of 62 \nwhite-chinned petrels suggest that their nocturnal behaviour is not influenced in a 63 \nconsistent way by moon phase (Delord et al. 2005; Gandini and Frere 2006; G\u00f3mez 64 \nLaich and Favero 2007; Moreno et al. 1996; Petersen et al. 2008a; Weimerskirch et al. 65 \n2000b). It might therefore be inferred that white-chinned petrels are well-adapted to 66 \nnocturnal foraging and able to detect their prey, including Antarctic krill Euphausia 67 \nsuperba, by sight or olfaction (Nevitt et al. 2004), independent of light levels. In 68 \ncontrast, Barnes et al. (1997) noted a diel cycle in their behaviour consisting of a 69 \nmidnight lull followed by increased activity peaking 2.5 hours before dawn, which 70 \nsuggests a direct or prey-mediated response to ambient light levels. 71 \nDuring the nonbreeding period (austral winter), white-chinned petrels 72 \ncongregate in large numbers over productive continental shelves (Phillips et al. 2006; 73 \nWeimerskirch et al. 1999). The South Georgia population utilises the Patagonian shelf 74 \nduring the nonbreeding, pre-laying exodus and incubation periods, but rarely during 75 \nchick-rearing when they mainly forage over the South Georgia shelf and shelf-slope, 76 \nand around the South Orkney Islands (Berrow et al. 2000a; Phillips et al. 2006). Over 77 \nthe Patagonian Shelf, white-chinned petrels are known to follow fishing vessels and to 78 \nfeed on discards in large numbers (Gandini and Frere 2006; G\u00f3mez Laich and Favero 79 \n2007; Gonz\u00e1lez-Zevallos and Yorio 2006; Moreno et al. 1996). Long-line fishing for 80 \nPatagonian toothfish Dissostichus eleginoides is banned in the vicinity of South Georgia 81 \nand the South Orkneys during the austral summer  (Phillips et al. 2006), and discards 82 \nwill be rare in the diet of white-chinned petrels during chick-rearing.  83 \nTargeting of different types of prey, from fisheries or varying marine habitats, 84 \npotentially requires different foraging techniques, which should be detectable by 85 \nanalysis of activity patterns. In addition, the few studies of activity in nonbreeding 86 \n 5 \nseabirds, which are without a central place constraint and therefore have lower energetic 87 \nand nutritional demands, show that they generally rest on the water for longer during 88 \ndaylight than birds that are breeding (Mackley et al. 2010; Phillips et al. 2007). Whether 89 \nactivity patterns of white-chinned petrels vary in the same way is unknown. The aims of 90 \nthis study were therefore to: (1) test for stage-related differences in white-chinned petrel 91 \nat-sea activity; (2) examine whether activity patterns vary with habitat; (3) compare the 92 \nactivity patterns of white-chinned petrels with those of other procellariiforms studied so 93 \nfar; and (4) test whether activity varies with moonlight. The white-chinned petrel 94 \npopulation at South Georgia has shown a sustained long-term decline, attributable 95 \nlargely to fisheries bycatch (Berrow et al. 2000b; Martin et al. 2009; Phillips et al. 96 \n2006). We therefore discuss how our results can inform bycatch mitigation efforts for 97 \nthis threatened species.  98 \n 99 \nMaterials and methods 100 \nCombined geolocator-immersion data loggers attached to a plastic leg ring (total 101 \nmass 10.5g; <1% of adult body mass), were deployed on the tarsi of adult white-102 \nchinned petrels extracted from burrows on Bird Island, South Georgia (54\u00b000\u2019S, 103 \n38\u00b003\u2019W) (for details see Phillips et al. 2006). Thirty-five loggers were deployed from 104 \n5\u20137 February 2003, of which twelve were recovered over the three subsequent breeding 105 \nseasons. Data were successfully downloaded from eleven loggers. Data from the 2003 106 \nnonbreeding period (February - October) and the following 2003\/04 breeding season 107 \n(October - February) were used in the analysis. Birds were of unknown sex.  108 \nThe data loggers measured visible light intensity every minute and tested for 109 \nsaltwater immersion every three seconds. The maximum (truncated) light level, and 110 \nnumber of positive tests from 0 (continuously dry) to 200 (continuously wet) were 111 \nstored at the end of each ten minute block. The light data were processed using 112 \n 6 \nMultiTrace (Jensen Software Systems) (see Phillips et al. 2004). Briefly, thresholds in 113 \nthe light curves, omitting those with obvious interruptions around dawn or dusk, were 114 \nused to determine sunrise and sunset. Those with obvious interruptions around down or 115 \ndusk were omitted when calculating distribution, whilst, for activity data, sunrise and 116 \nsunset were inferred from adjacent days. Latitude was derived from day length and 117 \nlongitude from the timing of local midday with respect to Universal Time and Julian 118 \nday. Latitudes were not available close to the equinoxes when day length is similar 119 \nacross the globe. Following the approach adopted by Mackley et al. (2010), a speed 120 \nfilter was used to highlight rapid easterly (20 kph) or westerly (12 kph) changes in 121 \nlocation (min. 1 day duration) during the nonbreeding period, which were visually 122 \ninspected for accuracy before designation as migrating (nonbreeding commuting) 123 \nperiods; otherwise, birds were considered to be resident.  124 \nThe activity data were processed automatically using scripts written in R (R 125 \nDevelopment Core Team 2008) to give eight measures of activity: the proportion of 126 \ntime spent on the water, the length of flight bouts in minutes, and the number of flight 127 \nbouts per hour, for both darkness and daylight, and; the proportion of the total time 128 \nspent on the water, and time spent in flight in each day (consecutive light and dark 129 \nperiod) that occurred during darkness. Each 10 min block was categorised as daylight or 130 \ndarkness, from the timing of nautical twilight (derived from the light curves in Multi-131 \ntrace). Flight bouts were defined as a continuous sequence of dry (0) values (see Phalan 132 \net al. 2007).  133 \nThe nonbreeding period started in February for all but one bird that departed in 134 \nApril, presumably following a successful breeding attempt. All birds began their pre-135 \nlaying exodus between late October and early November, returning to the colony mid- 136 \nto late November (Phillips et al. 2006). During the breeding period, activity data were 137 \nvisually inspected for extended dry periods (\u22651 day) that indicated birds were in 138 \n 7 \nburrows. For each foraging period, only data from the first to the last complete day of 139 \nat-sea activity were used in the analysis. Birds spent longer periods in the burrow during 140 \nincubation than chick-rearing (3 - 16 days and 1 - 3 days, respectively)(Marchant and 141 \nHiggins 1990). Chicks hatched in late December to late January, which was apparent in 142 \nan immediate switch to a pattern of short visits. The first chick-rearing foraging trip 143 \nfollowed the first short stay (1-3 days) in the burrow.  144 \nIn order to improve statistical normality flight bout durations were double log 145 \ntransformed and number of bouts per hour were square root transformed. Proportion 146 \ndata were either arcsin transformed or treated using a GLM with binomial error 147 \nstructure with a logit link function. The effects of stage were modelled using mixed-148 \neffects Generalised Linear Models fitted by Penalised Quasi Likelihood (Venables and 149 \nRipley 2002) with individual identity treated as a random effect (Pinheiro and Bates 150 \n2000). In addition, a first order autoregressive term (corAR1) was used to account for 151 \nnon-independence of errors due to temporal autocorrelation (however, due to 152 \ninsufficient computing power  - R was limited to 2Gb of memory with the windows 153 \noperating system - this term was not used to model flight bout duration. Comparative p-154 \nvalues were extracted by refitting these models with different intercepts. A mixed-155 \neffects linear model was used to test the relationship between the visible proportion of 156 \nthe moon, and activity parameter during resident, pre-laying exodus and incubation 157 \nstages. The illuminated proportions of the moon\u2019s visible disk at noon (universal time) 158 \nwere obtained from the Astronomical Applications Department of the United States 159 \nNaval Observatory (http:\/\/aa.usno.navy.mil\/data\/docs\/MoonFraction.html) following 160 \nPhalan et al. (2007). For all other analyses using conventional tests, the activity 161 \nmeasures were averaged for each individual bird to prevent pseudo-replication. The 162 \narithmetic observed mean \u00b1 SD are reported in the tables to facilitate comparisons with 163 \nprevious studies and the estimated mean \u00b1 95% confidence interval are shown in Fig 1. 164 \n 8 \nGiven the large number of comparisons, the threshold for statistical significance was set 165 \nto P<0.01.   166 \n 167 \nResults  168 \nImmersion data were available from eleven birds during the nonbreeding phase, ten 169 \nduring the pre-laying exodus, six during incubation (20 trips) and three during chick-170 \nrearing (8 trips). The distributions for 10 of the 11 birds in this study (the other logger 171 \nwas not retrieved until December 2005) are presented in Phillips et al. (2006). All 172 \neleven white-chinned petrels initially went to the Patagonian Shelf from South Georgia 173 \nfor the nonbreeding period. In mid-winter (May - June), three birds moved to the 174 \nHumboldt Current west of South America, of which one returned directly to South 175 \nGeorgia and the other two via the Patagonian Shelf. These movements typically 176 \noccurred as rapid and sustained periods of flight (mean: 1 day, range: 1-2 days), 177 \nhereafter termed \u2018migration\u2019. During their pre-laying exodus, all ten birds travelled to 178 \nthe Patagonian Shelf to forage (mean: 18 days, range 7-28 days). Similarly, most 179 \nforaging trips during incubation (mean: 8 days, range: 2-16 days) were to the 180 \nPatagonian Shelf, whereas chick-rearing birds feed in Antarctic waters south of the 181 \nPolar Front, and in the southern Scotia Sea in particular (mean 4.5 days, range: 2-8 182 \ndays).   183 \n 184 \nIndividual variability 185 \nDuring the resident phase of the nonbreeding period, variation was consistently higher 186 \nbetween than within individuals (One-way ANOVA for each activity measure: F(10,2513-187 \n9595) = 3.95 \u2013 17.75, P<0.001) whereas behaviour was more fixed during migration 188 \n(One-way ANOVA for each activity measure: F(9-10,14-156) = 0.97-2.32, P = 0.509-189 \n0.073). Behaviour during the breeding period was generally invariant between 190 \n 9 \nindividuals for all three stages (One-way ANOVA for each activity measure, pre-laying 191 \nexodus: F(9,168-629) = 0.60-2.13, P = 0.797-0.025; incubation: F(5,156-159) = 0.76-2.37, P = 192 \n0.437-0.042; chick-rearing F(2,31-313) = 0.15-1.82, P = 0.858-0.178). However, there 193 \nwere exceptions: during the pre-laying exodus both the number and length of flight 194 \nbouts during daylight differed significantly between individuals (F(9,172) = 2.69, P = 195 \n0.006 and F(9,1271) = 4.50, P<0.001, respectively); during incubation flight bout length 196 \nduring darkness and daylight differed between individuals (F(5,529) = 3.86, P = 0.002 and 197 \nF(5,1226) = 8.96, P<0.001 respectively) as did the number of flight bouts per hour during 198 \ndaylight (F(5,159) = 16.98, P<0.001). Additionally, during chick-rearing, the proportion 199 \nof flight that was at night showed a near significant difference between individuals 200 \n(F(2,34) = 5.12, P = 0.011). 201 \n 202 \nComparison of breeding stages and nonbreeding phases 203 \nDuring the resident phase of the nonbreeding period, birds spent significantly more time 204 \non the water than during any stage during daylight and, with the exception of migration, 205 \nalso darkness (Fig. 1a). The proportion of total time in flight that occurred during 206 \ndarkness was greatest for resident nonbreeders, and a similar trend was apparent in the 207 \nproportion of total time on the water that occurred during darkness, for both 208 \nnonbreeding phases, i.e. resident and migrating (Fig. 1b). This probably reflected the 209 \nlonger nights during winter, as the smallest values occurred during the incubation 210 \nperiod, coinciding with the shortest mid-summer nights. Flight bouts were longest when 211 \nmigrating, and shortest when resident, during both daylight and darkness (Fig. 1c). 212 \nResident birds showed the least frequent flight bouts during daylight, and there was a 213 \nsimilar overall trend apparent during darkness (Fig. 1d). The proportions of time spent 214 \non the water decreased as the breeding season progressed; hence, chick-rearing birds 215 \n 10 \nrested for the shortest periods (Fig.1a). The lack of statistical significance despite this 216 \nclear trend is presumably related to the low sample size.  217 \n 218 \nOcean sector 219 \nFor three birds that moved from the Patagonian Shelf to the Humboldt Current during 220 \nthe nonbreeding period, there were no significant differences in their resident activity 221 \npatterns (Table 1). 222 \n 223 \nIlluminated moon 224 \nThere were no significant differences between stages in the range of values of the 225 \nilluminated proportion of the moon\u2019s disc experienced (Fig. 2). However, as the 226 \nmigration and chick-rearing activity data did not include a complete lunar cycle, these 227 \nwere not included in the illuminated moon analysis. The influence of moon phase was 228 \ngreatest during the resident nonbreeding period. In contrast fewer activity measures 229 \nvaried with illuminated moon during the pre-laying exodus and fewer still during 230 \nincubation (Table 2). All nocturnal measures of activity were affected during the 231 \nresident period: birds spent a lower proportion of time on the water, and showed more 232 \nfrequent and longer bouts of flight as the illuminated moon increased. Furthermore, the 233 \nduration of flight bouts during daylight increased. Flight bout durations and the 234 \nproportion of time spent on the water during daylight increased with illuminated moon 235 \nduring the pre-laying exodus. During the pre-laying exodus the proportion of time on 236 \nthe water that occurred in darkness decreased, whereas the proportion of time spent in 237 \nflight increased, with an increase in the illuminated moon. During incubation, only one 238 \nmeasure of activity varied with illuminated moon: birds reduced the proportion of time 239 \nspent on the water during darkness as the proportion of illuminated moon increased. 240 \n 241 \n 11 \nDiscussion 242 \nOur study is unusual in that it is the first to provide comprehensive coverage of at-sea 243 \nactivity patterns throughout the annual cycle of any procellariid other than the large 244 \nalbatrosses. The relatively low logger recovery rate was attributed to the initial 245 \ndeployment on a high proportion of prospecting birds, consequent low burrow fidelity, 246 \nand breeding deferral in subsequent seasons (Phillips et al. 2006). The logger load (<1% 247 \nof body mass) was considerably less than that (c. 3%) at which effects on bird 248 \nbehaviour generally become apparent (Phillips et al. 2003). It is unlikely therefore that 249 \nthe behaviour of these individuals was compromised by the loggers and presumably, the 250 \nactivity patterns are typical of the species. 251 \n 252 \nChanges in white-chinned petrel activity patterns 253 \nBreeding stage and nonbreeding phase 254 \nLike Southern Ocean albatrosses, the at-sea activity of white-chinned petrels 255 \nwas highly influenced by the degree of central place constraint (Mackley et al. 2010; 256 \nPhalan et al. 2007). During the resident phase of the nonbreeding period, when birds are 257 \nunconstrained and energetic demand is lowest, the petrels spent the highest proportion 258 \nof time on the water, and exhibited the fewest and shortest flight bouts during daylight, 259 \nwith a similar trend apparent during darkness. Constraints increase across the breeding 260 \nstages and are highest when provisioning chicks (Shaffer et al. 2003). That the 261 \nproportion of time spent on the water decreased and flight bout duration tended to 262 \nincrease as the breeding season progressed presumably reflects a significant ecological 263 \neffect. 264 \n  White-chinned petrels replace their primary feathers sequentially during the 265 \nnonbreeding period (Marchant and Higgins 1990). This may alter their flight ability and 266 \nthereby activity patterns, particularly if several primaries are shed simultaneously 267 \n 12 \n(Bridge 2006). However, because this species is highly dependent upon its aerial agility 268 \nin order to capture prey it appears that, as in albatrosses (Mackley et al. 2010), their 269 \nmoult sequence may be adapted to have minimal impact on flight, certainly there was 270 \nno evidence for a prolonged period of flightlessness. Furthermore, effects on activity 271 \nmay be minimal because at this time of year energetic expenditure is in any case 272 \nrelatively low.  273 \nDuring the resident nonbreeding phase, white-chinned petrels exhibited similar 274 \nlevels of activity during darkness and daylight: the mean proportion of time spent on the 275 \nwater was 62% and 61%, flight bout durations were 63 and 67 mins, and the number of 276 \nflight bouts per hour were 0.32 and 0.30, respectively. This demonstrates the aptitude of 277 \nthis petrel for diurnal and nocturnal foraging. However, birds increased effort 278 \n(expressed as flight) further during daylight in response to the increased energetic 279 \ndemands of migration or breeding. Similarly, Weimerskirch et al. (2000b) observed that 280 \nattendance of petrels at fishing vessels increased with daylight during the breeding 281 \nperiod. This tendency to increase diurnal activity mirrors that of Southern Ocean 282 \nalbatrosses, for which aerial detection and capture of prey is limited during darkness by 283 \nlow light-levels (Mackley et al. 2010; Phalan et al. 2007). It seems therefore that there 284 \nare periods of darkness during which even this nocturnal species is limited by ambient 285 \nlight levels (also see Barnes et al. 1997). Under such circumstances, white-chinned 286 \npetrels may nevertheless continue to forage whilst resting on the water by surface-287 \nseizing crustaceans and squid (Harper 1987) utilising the sit-and-wait method described 288 \nfor albatrosses (Catry et al. 2004; Weimerskirch et al. 1997). 289 \nMean flight bout lengths (excluding migration) were relatively short compared 290 \nto other procellariiforms (Table 4), during both daylight (67-85 mins) and darkness (62-291 \n77 mins), which suggests white-chinned petrels consistently use confined searches in 292 \nareas of high prey abundance (Weimerskirch et al. 1997). The longer mean flight bout 293 \n 13 \ndurations recorded during breeding may result from increasing the search radius around 294 \nprey patches, as well as the long commutes between the breeding colony and foraging 295 \nareas (Berrow et al. 2000a; Phillips et al. 2006). In addition, high individual variability 296 \nin measures of flight during breeding stages may reflect individual differences in 297 \ndistribution (Phillips et al. 2006).  298 \nDuring migration, the petrels reduced proportions of time spent on the water by 299 \n51-76%, and increased flight bout durations by 1.6-1.8 times relative to resident phases. 300 \nThis increased effort is in accordance with previous satellite tracks of their rapid long-301 \ndistance movements (Catard et al. 2000; Weimerskirch et al. 1999). The gliding and 302 \nflap-gliding flight of white-chinned petrels increases their metabolic rate (Pennycuick 303 \n1987). Therefore, the limited between-individual variation in behaviour during this 304 \nphase would suggest that the petrels were working at or close to their energetic maxima. 305 \n 306 \nForaging location and environmental heterogeneity  307 \nWhite-chinned petrels forage widely across the Southern Ocean, 308 \nopportunistically exploiting patches of high prey abundance (Catard et al. 2000). The 309 \napparent consistency in activity patterns of nonbreeding individuals utilising both the 310 \nPatagonian Shelf (open shelf) and Humboldt Current (shelf-slope) suggest that either 311 \ntheir prey were similar, or, perhaps more likely, that different prey types could be 312 \nexploited with equal success in these two habitats using typical foraging behaviour.  313 \n 314 \nComparison with other procellariiforms 315 \nNocturnal activity  316 \nOur results indicate that white-chinned petrels are more nocturnally active than 317 \nSouthern Ocean albatross species for which activity patterns are available (Tables 3, 4), 318 \nwith the exception of nonbreeding light-mantled albatross (Mackley et al. 2010). This 319 \n 14 \ndifference was greatest during the chick-rearing period, when white-chinned petrels 320 \nspent only 28% of darkness on the water, and least during the resident nonbreeding 321 \nphase (see Table 3).  322 \nComparable studies of smaller procellariiform species are limited to a tropical 323 \nshearwater and a gadfly petrel; both spent similar proportions of daylight on the water, 324 \nbut their nocturnal activity was notably different from white-chinned petrels (Table 3). 325 \nNonbreeding wedge-tailed shearwaters Puffinus pacificus spent a higher proportion of 326 \ndarkness on the water, probably preferring to maximise efficiency by foraging in 327 \nassociation with tunas that pursue prey during daylight (Catry et al. 2009). Cook\u2019s 328 \npetrels from two distant colonies in New Zealand generally forage far from their 329 \ncolonies in either subtropical (Little Barrier Island), or highly productive subtropical 330 \nconvergence waters (Codfish Island) (Rayner et al. 2008). Birds feeding chicks from 331 \nthese colonies spent a greater (40%), or lower proportion (20%) of time on the water at 332 \nnight, respectively, than white-chinned petrels (28%). These species are therefore 333 \nsimilarly nocturnal, with the differences in activity most probably related to differences 334 \nin the type and abundance of prey they exploit (Rayner et al. 2008).  335 \nFor all stages (except migration) the proportions of time spent on the water by 336 \nwhite-chinned petrels during daylight and darkness differed by only 1.3-7.4%. This lack 337 \nof variability is in contrast to albatrosses, where the differences varied from 16.8% 338 \n(resident phase light-mantled albatrosses) to 76.2% (post-brood grey-headed albatrosses 339 \nThalassarche chrysostoma), representing the nocturnal and diurnal extremes of the 340 \nSouthern Ocean species and stages (Table 3). Their greater flexibility in the timing of 341 \nactivity means that resident nonbreeding white-chinned petrels rest on the water, or at 342 \nleast do not actively pursue prey, for a greater proportion of daylight (61%) than any 343 \nalbatross (33-59%, (Mackley et al. 2010; this study). The closest value (59%) for the 344 \n 15 \nwandering albatross Diomedea exulans may not reflect rest per se but the longer time 345 \nrequired for handling and digestion of larger prey (Mackley et al. 2010).  346 \n 347 \nFlight 348 \nWhite-chinned petrels migrate for shorter distances between South Georgia and 349 \ntheir wintering areas (the Patagonian Shelf and Humboldt Current) than sympatric 350 \nalbatrosses (Phillips et al. 2008). These transits are also more rapid, completed within 1-351 \n2 days (Phillips et al. 2006; this study) probably due to a combination of their direct 352 \nflap-gliding flight and bouts that are longer, during both day and night (108 and 114 353 \nmins), than all but wandering albatrosses (114 and 121 mins (Mackley et al. 2010). This 354 \nsuggests that they are able to sustain long periods of fast, direct flight in order to 355 \nminimise the time spent in areas of lower prey availability. 356 \nMixed feeding flocks in the Southern Ocean are dominated by white-chinned 357 \npetrels and black-browed albatrosses (Nevitt et al. 2004), which have comparably short 358 \ndurations of flight during daylight, indicative of prey searching over small spatial scales 359 \n(Mackley et al. 2010; Phalan et al. 2007; Weimerskirch and Guionnet 2002).  360 \nDifferences between these species at night (Table 4) probably result from their 361 \nnocturnal visual acuity, with black-browed albatrosses switching to prey searching 362 \npredominantly by olfaction, with consequently longer flight bouts (Mackley et al. 363 \n2010). White-chinned petrels also have highly developed olfaction, important in the 364 \ninitial detection of prey patches (Nevitt et al. 2004) but are presumably not restricted to 365 \nlocating individual prey items by olfaction alone, given the consistency in flight bout 366 \ndurations between day and night.   367 \n 368 \nEffect of illuminated moon on activity 369 \n 16 \nIn our study we used the proportion of illuminated moon as a proxy for 370 \nnocturnal light levels, although we were of course unable to account for the effects of 371 \nvariation in cloud cover. Nevertheless, changes in some measures of activity with this 372 \nproxy were highly significant, suggesting that the confounding effect of cloud cover 373 \nwas slight. The effects on activity were stage dependent; all nocturnal activity measures 374 \nwere affected during the resident nonbreeding period, whereas effects were fewer, and 375 \nmore variable as the breeding period progressed. On moonlit nights, increased aerial 376 \nactivity indicated higher foraging effort, probably as prey became harder to detect or 377 \ncapture because they remained at depth. White-chinned petrels are constrained by their 378 \nmaximum dive depth (12m; Huin 1994) and therefore lunar periodicity in the diel 379 \nvertical migrations of their prey may alter foraging success, as recorded for immature 380 \nGal\u00e1pagos fur seals Arctocephalus galapagoensis (Horning and Trillmich 1999). 381 \nPossibly as a consequence of poorer nocturnal foraging success, the petrels increased 382 \naerial searches during daylight, particularly during the pre-laying exodus. This may 383 \nreflect opportunistic exploitation of a seasonally available prey source, for example, 384 \njuvenile squid Martialia hyadesi (Rodhouse et al. 1992), which may coincide with both 385 \nthe timing and dispersal pattern of the pre-laying exodus (Phillips et al. 2006). During 386 \nincubation, nocturnal illumination had limited influence on activity and it was not found 387 \nto affect distance travelled by white-chinned petrels at night in a previous study 388 \n(Weimerskirch et al. 1999). It is probable that increased energy demands as the breeding 389 \nperiod progresses require consistent increases in effort regardless of moonlight. 390 \nThis stage-dependent plasticity in activity may have caused the disparities in 391 \npast studies that have examined behavioural responses of white-chinned petrels to 392 \nvarious measures of moonlight: those that were of nonbreeding or immature white-393 \nchinned petrels recorded significant effects (Moreno et al. 1996; Petersen et al. 2008a), 394 \nwhereas those that occurred during the breeding period (Delord et al. 2005; 395 \n 17 \nWeimerskirch et al. 2000b), or were based on long-term averages (Gandini and Frere 396 \n2006; G\u00f3mez Laich and Favero 2007) found no significant or consistent correlates. It is 397 \npossible that artificial lighting is sufficient, regardless of moon phase, for breeding 398 \npetrels to increase foraging effort around fishing vessels (Barnes et al. 1997), thereby 399 \nmasking any response to natural conditions. Stage-dependent responses to moonlight 400 \ncould be clarified by data on the activity patterns of grey petrels Procellaria cinerea, 401 \nwhich share common attributes but breed during the austral winter, potentially 402 \nexplaining why in the austral summer, grey but not white-chinned petrels respond to 403 \nilluminated moon (Delord et al. 2005).  404 \n 405 \nFisheries and conservation 406 \nGiven the propensity of white-chinned petrels to forage in association with fisheries on 407 \nthe Patagonian Shelf (G\u00f3mez Laich and Favero 2007; Phillips et al. 2006), it cannot be 408 \nassumed that the activity patterns observed during the nonbreeding, pre-laying exodus 409 \nand incubation periods are entirely natural foraging (note that this is not the case during 410 \nchick-rearing, when there is little overlap with fishing vessels). Nevertheless, tracking 411 \nof individual black-browed albatrosses, which are similarly attracted to fisheries, found 412 \nthey spent surprisingly little time in association with fishing vessels (Petersen et al. 413 \n2008b), and the same may be true of many white-chinned petrels.  414 \nIncidental mortality of white-chinned petrels is disproportionately high, to a 415 \nlarge extent related to their high levels of nocturnal activity (Delord et al. 2005). The 416 \nsuccess of night setting may be improved by avoiding moonlit nights during the 417 \nnonbreeding period, and by use of additional mitigation measures during the breeding 418 \nperiod. These are also the times when monitoring of compliance by fisheries observers 419 \nis particularly important. During the chick-rearing period, when nocturnal activity is 420 \nhigh, nights are short, and birds are actively foraging for their chicks as well as for self-421 \n 18 \nmaintenance, seasonal closures in petrel foraging areas will continue to be the most 422 \neffective solution. 423 \n 424 \nAcknowledgements This research represents a contribution to the British Antarctic 425 \nSurvey Ecosystems Programme.
