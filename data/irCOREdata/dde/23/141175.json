Introduction6\n1.1 Background7\nThe composting process is reliant on the presence of various micro-organisms, such8\nas fungi and bacteria, which may become airborne and pose a risk to human health (Douwes9\net al., 2003). In partial response to perceived public health concerns, the Environment10\nAgency of England and Wales require a risk assessment to be undertaken for composting11\nfacilities of a certain size that have a sensitive receptor within 250m of their boundaries,12\nwhich should examine, among other hazards, the dispersal of airborne micro-organisms or13\nbioaerosols from the site (Wheeler et al., 2001; Environment Agency, 2002; Pollard et al.,14\n2006). In the context of a risk assessment, sensitive receptors may include a residence,15\nschool or office building. The aim of the risk assessment is to provide a useful tool for risk16\nmanagement. However, the quality of the risk assessment is dependant on the availability17\nand quality of the bioaerosol source term data (among other things) employed (Pollard et al.,18\n2006). This data is frequently limited, in part because of the practical difficulties of19\nmicrobiological analyses but also due to cost constraints.20\nThere is a growing body of research that examines the concentrations of bioaerosols21\nin and around composting facilities (e.g. Danneberg et al., 1997; Swan et al., 2002; Sanches-22\nMonedero and Stentiford, 2003). Many studies that attempt to predict the dispersal of23\nbioaerosols from facilities use simple methods or dispersion models (e.g. Millner et al., 1980,24\nLighthart and Mohr, 1987; Swan et al., 2003; ADAS\/SWICEB, 2005) and thus produce risk25\nTaha, M.P.M., Drew, G.H., Tamer, A., Hewings, G., Jordinson, G.M., Longhurst, P.J., Pollard, S.J.T., Atmospheric\nEnvironment, 41 (21) pp. 4504-4519.\n3\nestimates that are overly conservative. Air dispersion models were developed to predict1\ndispersion of pollutants, such as the nitrogen oxides, and have also successfully been used for2\nassessing odour dispersion from industry (e.g. Environment Agency, 2002). However, the3\nuse of these models for bioaerosol dispersion has been limited, as dispersion models may not4\nbe able to take into account the mechanisms of release of bacteria and fungi.5\nAccording to McCartney (1994), environmental factors such as wind speed,6\nturbulence, humidity and water availability will influence when spores are released.7\nAlthough these parameters are taken into account by dispersion models when predicting8\ndownwind concentrations, there are very few \u2018at source\u2019 measurements of bioaerosol9\nconcentrations that link these parameters to the concentrations measured. Furthermore,10\ncertain characteristics of bioaerosols complicate the use of dispersion models and, in11\nparticular, their ability to form aggregates or clumps once released, and the loss of viability12\nthat may occur as they are emitted from the compost windrow (Wheeler et al., 2001).13\nOur own research (Taha et al., 2004; 2005; 2006a; 2006b) focuses on improving the14\nquality of regulatory risk assessments for composting by providing:15\ni. accurate source term data at the point of release (Taha et al., 2006a); and16\nii. developing new methods for improving sampling and enumeration of bioaerosols17\n(Taha et al., 2006b).18\nHere, we propose further improvements by presenting the refinement of air dispersion19\nmodelling for the prediction of downwind bioaerosol concentrations of off-site points of20\nexposure.21\n22\n1.2 Study Rationale23\nIn this paper, we present results from measuring the dispersal of bioaerosols from a24\ngreen waste composting research facility in southern Wales. The advantage of sampling at a25\nTaha, M.P.M., Drew, G.H., Tamer, A., Hewings, G., Jordinson, G.M., Longhurst, P.J., Pollard, S.J.T., Atmospheric\nEnvironment, 41 (21) pp. 4504-4519.\n4\nresearch facility was that the processes on site could be adjusted to aid the sampling1\nactivities, for example, timing of shredding and screening. The objectives of the study were2\n(i) to characterise the source term bioaerosol emissions, taking into consideration storage3\nproperties, compost age and dispersal during agitation using a windrow turner, front-end4\nloader, screener and shredder; and (ii) to compare the predicted downwind concentrations5\nmodelled by two separate dispersion models. We seek to improve bioaerosol exposure6\nassessments by refining the methods currently used to estimate downwind dispersal of7\ncompost emissions.8\nIn order to estimate static pile emission flux rate and bioaerosol active dispersal9\nemission rate during agitation, the conservative SCREEN3 (USEPA, 1995a) model was used10\nto initially estimate bioaerosol depletion curves. SCREEN3 is a screening-level model that11\nadopts steady-state Gaussian plume algorithms and meteorological scenarios to estimate12\nworst-case dispersal. This was followed by application of more advanced modelling using13\nthe ADMS 3.3 air dispersion model (Carruthers et al., 1994; CERC, 2003). ADMS is an14\nadvanced steady state, Gaussian-like dispersion model, capable of modelling continuous15\nplumes, short duration releases and transport over complex terrain. The model simulates16\npoint, line, area and volume sources, and can estimate pollutant concentrations at a number of17\nuser defined receptors. The model has been shown to perform in a comparable manner to18\nsimilar new generation models (Hanna et al., 2000). Using the model results, we infer the19\npossible influences that bioaerosol properties such as inactivation and microbial20\nagglomeration may have on the depletion curves (concentration with distance) and21\nconcentration with distance produced by the models.22\n23\n2. Material and Methods24\nTaha, M.P.M., Drew, G.H., Tamer, A., Hewings, G., Jordinson, G.M., Longhurst, P.J., Pollard, S.J.T., Atmospheric\nEnvironment, 41 (21) pp. 4504-4519.\n5\nThe study site is a research composting facility handling ca. 12000 m3 of shredded1\ngreen waste per annum in windrows under a 1500 m2 building with open sides. Samples2\nwere taken from compost windrows (passive emissions) aged at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 163\nweeks, and during agitation activities (active emissions) on site, such as turning, shredding4\nand screening. For turning activities, measurement was conducted on 1, 4, 8 and 12 weeks.5\nSampling was undertaken between January and March 2005.6\n7\n2.1 Bioaerosol sampling8\nDirect sampling of bioaerosols from static compost windrows was undertaken using a9\nportable wind tunnel (Jiang et al., 2000; Taha et al., 2005; 2006a) positioned on the compost10\nwindrows to allow the direct measurement of the bioaerosol flux. Incoming air, filtered11\nthrough activated carbon is blown into the inlet duct using a fan. Bioaerosols are mixed into12\nthe bulk of the carrier air and vented from the hood to the sampling device.13\nFor safety and practical reasons, it was not possible to use the portable wind tunnel14\nduring compost processing activities. Instead, bioaerosols were sampled at the closest safe15\nand practical distance (5-10 m) downwind of various process activities. These distances are16\nmuch closer to operations than in many other studies (e.g. ADAS\/SWICEB, 2005). The17\nairborne micro-organisms were collected onto filter media using a medium flow pump18\nfollowed by elution and plating. The flow rate was ca. 2 l\/min and the filter media used was19\n0.8 mm polycarbonate. Mean wind speed (max and mean) and temperature (K) during20\nsampling were recorded using a thermal anemometer (Testo 425). Three successive samples21\nwere taken over a 45 min sampling interval during turning. Samples were taken during green22\nwaste screening, compost turning, and compost loading operations.23\nControl (i.e. on-site background) bioaerosol concentrations were measured at a height24\nof 1.8m, at positions up- and downwind (5-10m) of the compost windrows, using the method25\nTaha, M.P.M., Drew, G.H., Tamer, A., Hewings, G., Jordinson, G.M., Longhurst, P.J., Pollard, S.J.T., Atmospheric\nEnvironment, 41 (21) pp. 4504-4519.\n6\ndescribed above for active sampling. This method was also used to sample the air directly1\nabove the compost pile (0.3m).2\n3\n2.2 Sample collection and preservation4\nThe methods used for sample collection and preservation are described in Taha et al.5\n(2006a). In both the active and passive release modes above, bioaerosols were sampled using6\na medium flow, personal aerosol filter sampler (SKC Universal dust and vapour sampling7\npump). The pump was operated at 2.0 \u00b1 0.1 l\/min and fitted with SKC dust sampling8\nInstitute of Occupational Medicine (IOM) heads (25mm) (Wheeler et al., 2001), loaded with9\nmixed cellulose ester filters (25 mm x 0.8 \u03bcm pore size). Microorganisms were quantified10\nusing the CAMNEA-method (Collection of Airborne Microorganisms on Nuclepore filters,11\nEstimation and Analysis) (Palmgren et al., 1986). The cellulose ester filters were placed12\ninside a 30ml vial (Nalgene) containing 10ml 0.05%v\/v Tween-80 mixed with 0.1%w\/w NaCl to13\nprevent cell osmosis and stored within a cold box at < 4\u00b0C. On return to the laboratory,14\nbioaerosols were re-suspended by agitating the filter, the filter casing and the amended15\nTween-80 solution together in the vial for ca. 2 minutes. The solution was diluted in a16\ncommon logarithm order and inoculated within 48 hours on agar plates to prevent sporulation17\nof micro-organisms leading to erroneous results.18\n19\n2.3 Bioaerosol enumeration20\nAspergillus fumigatus and actinomycetes sampled during active processing operations21\nand from static compost windrows were enumerated by visual inspection. Media preparation,22\ninoculation, dilution and sterilisation were performed in accordance with BS 5763: Part23\n0:1996. For actinomycetes, two media were used and developed simultaneously:24\n(i) half strength nutrient agar (Oxoid); and25\nTaha, M.P.M., Drew, G.H., Tamer, A., Hewings, G., Jordinson, G.M., Longhurst, P.J., Pollard, S.J.T., Atmospheric\nEnvironment, 41 (21) pp. 4504-4519.\n7\n(ii) soil compost agar (a supernatant of 10%w\/w of loam-based compost John Innes1\nNo. 1 compost in agar).2\nFurther details are reported in Taha et al. (2006b). After preparation, both media3\nwere autoclaved (105\u00b0C, 15 min), left to cool to below 47\u00b0C and treated with 1%v\/v4\nantifungal cycloheximide, dissolved in less than 2ml of ethanol. For A. fumigatus, malt5\nextract agar (Merck) was mixed with 0.01% w\/w antibacterial chloramphenicol (Sigma, UK).6\nNutrient agar plates and soil compost agar plates were incubated at 44\u00b0C. Malt extract agar7\nplates were incubated at 37\u00b0C, the optimum temperature for A. fumigatus (Swan et al., 2002).8\nColonies growing on both media were enumerated visually after 3 to 14 days. The 95%9\nconfidence interval of micro-organisms dispersed in a solution was estimated using10\nguidelines provided in the BS 5763 standard.11\n12\n2.4 SCREEN3 depletion curves13\nModelling the depletion of bioaerosols with distance downwind of a facility requires14\nprior estimation of a bioaerosol flux. An estimation of the bioaerosol emission flux and15\nconstruction of a depletion curve for static compost windrows is provided in Taha et al.16\n(2005). For the active source term study, the approach of Dowd et al. (2000) was adopted, in17\nwhich field analysis data was first used to backcalculate a flux rate at source using an18\nairborne transport model, as there is no safe method of measuring the rate of release during19\nagitation directly at 0 m (Taha et al., 2006a). Furthermore, as the passive releases tend to be20\nfrom standard sized windrows, these were represented in the model as area sources. As the21\nactive releases tend to occur at a specific location within the facility, they were represented as22\npoint sources in SCREEN3. The full model parameters used in these experiments are23\nprovided in Table 1.24\nTaha, M.P.M., Drew, G.H., Tamer, A., Hewings, G., Jordinson, G.M., Longhurst, P.J., Pollard, S.J.T., Atmospheric\nEnvironment, 41 (21) pp. 4504-4519.\n8\nSeveral simplifying and limiting assumptions are made in performing the modelling:1\n(a) the particles displayed a Gaussian distribution in both lateral (crosswind) and vertical2\ndirections; (b) no gravitational deposition is assumed; (c) the source was assumed to be3\ncontinuous; (d) the wind velocity and direction were constant over the modelled time and4\ndistance; (e) the modelled surface was relatively flat; (f) the effects of buildings were not5\ntaken into account; (g) the gravitational settling of particles was assumed to be negligible; (h)6\nthe particle and wind velocity were assumed to be the same; and (i) microbial inactivation7\nwas not considered. In the light of these substantial simplifications and methodological8\nconstraints, the results presented from the SCREEN3 model are likely to be highly9\nconservative.10\n11\n2.5 ADMS 3 depletion curves12\nThe parameters and variables defined for the SCREEN3 modelling (Table 1) were13\nused in ADMS 3.3, in order to provide a direct comparison between the two models. ADMS14\n3.3 was employed to address some of the simplifying assumptions used during SCREEN315\nmodelling. Several ADMS 3.3 experiments were undertaken. The first replicated the16\nSCREEN3 modelling, using the pre-defined stability classes and modelling each source17\nseparately. The second set of experiments modelled the sources as a group, producing a18\ncombined output for the facility as a whole. These experiments were repeated for both19\norganisms measured (actinomycetes and Aspergillus fumigatus), and for the active and20\npassive samples. The passive emission rates were modelled as area sources, to represent the21\nwindrows. As the active samples were taken at a point near the agitation activity, these are22\nmodelled as point sources.23\n24\n3. Results and discussion25\nTaha, M.P.M., Drew, G.H., Tamer, A., Hewings, G., Jordinson, G.M., Longhurst, P.J., Pollard, S.J.T., Atmospheric\nEnvironment, 41 (21) pp. 4504-4519.\n9\nBioaerosol concentrations measured using the wind tunnel and directly above the1\ncompost pile (passive emissions) are presented in Figure 1 and 2. Bioaerosol concentrations2\nand the estimated emission rates downwind from the various processing activities are3\npresented in Table 1 and Figure 3. The source depletion curves constructed for the passive4\nemissions are presented in Figure 4 (Aspergillus fumigatus) and Figure 5 (actinomycetes).5\nSimilarly, the source depletion curves for the active emissions are shown in Figures 6 and 7.6\nThe results of the combined sources modelling using ADMS 3.3 are presented in Figures 8 to7\n11.8\n9\n3.1 Bioaerosol concentrations (static emissions)10\nThe concentration of Aspergillus fumigatus measured within the facility ranged11\nbetween 103 and 104 cfu\/m3 (Figure 1). The concentration of actinomycetes was within a12\nsimilar range, with a higher maximum concentration (103 to 105 cfu\/m3). The bioaerosol13\nconcentrations measured with the wind tunnel did not reveal a distinct trend as the compost14\naged (Figure 1). It is therefore not possible to state that emissions will increase or decrease as15\ncompost ages, based on these results. However, the measurement of air directly above the16\ncompost pile (0.3m) showed a higher bioaerosols concentration at the early stage of17\ncomposting, which gradually reduced over the 16 weeks (Figure 2). However the18\nconcentration increased when the compost age was 16 weeks, which we believe may be due19\nto different weather conditions or drying of the compost. These readings indicated the20\npresence of significant amounts of bioaerosols in air close to the surface of the compost pile,21\nunder static conditions, compared to a typical background concentration of 1000 cfu\/m322\n(Wheeler et al., 2001).23\nThe specific bioaerosol emission rates (SBERs) estimated ranged from 100 cfu\/m2\/s24\nto 1200 cfu\/m2\/s for all samples in which bioaerosols were detected. This range is lower by25\nTaha, M.P.M., Drew, G.H., Tamer, A., Hewings, G., Jordinson, G.M., Longhurst, P.J., Pollard, S.J.T., Atmospheric\nEnvironment, 41 (21) pp. 4504-4519.\n10\none log than the SBERs of 8000 - 22000 cfu\/ m2\/s measured by Taha et al. (2006a) at a full1\nscale commercial facility. The contributing factors to this difference are the buildings that2\nreduce emissions and the ambient wind velocity, as research has shown that higher wind3\nvelocities are required to release bioaerosols (McCartney, 1994; Tay et al., 2001). At this4\nstudy site, the wind velocity average was 0.3m\/s (due to the covered nature of the facility5\nwhich reduces the wind velocity inside the boundaries) whereas Taha et al. (2006a) measured6\nan ambient wind velocity of 1m\/s. This is shown when the SBER inside the wind tunnel and7\nthe SBER with the ambient wind velocity are compared. Taha et al. (2006a) found SBERs of8\n1100-4000 cfu\/m2\/s inside the wind tunnel and 100 to 1100 cfu\/m2\/s, with the ambient wind9\nvelocity.10\n11\n3.2 Bioaerosol concentrations (dynamic emissions)12\nThe dynamic release of bioaerosols was assessed by estimating the bioaerosol13\nemission rate during different activities and for different compost ages. The activities studied14\nhere were shredding, turning and screening of the compost, similar to those studied by Taha15\net al. (2006a). In addition, the emission rate from a windrow turner is estimated. The16\nconcentration of bioaerosols measured at ca.5-10m from agitation activities are shown in17\nFigure 3. The concentrations generally range between 104 and 105 cfu\/m3. However18\nconcentrations as low as 103 cfu\/m3 and as high as 106 cfu\/m3 were also measured. These19\nconcentrations are at least 1-log higher than those recorded for the passive releases and20\nsupport the suggestion by Taha et al. (2006a) that the agitation activities are the main sources21\nfor these operational, episodic emissions. It is also important to note that turning, either by22\nfront-end loader or windrow turner, is a non-stationary activity and it is not possible to23\nsample the emissions directly at source.24\nTaha, M.P.M., Drew, G.H., Tamer, A., Hewings, G., Jordinson, G.M., Longhurst, P.J., Pollard, S.J.T., Atmospheric\nEnvironment, 41 (21) pp. 4504-4519.\n11\nFrom the measurement data for the agitation activities (Figure 3), the emission rate1\nwas then estimated using the SCREEN3 air dispersion model (Table 2). Turning at this site2\nrecorded maximum emission rates between 104 and 107 cfu\/s, with the maximum reading3\nbeing 2-log lower than that estimated by Taha et al. (2006a).4\nThe results show no significant emission rate differences between different ages of5\ncompost pile. However, there is a significant difference between activities, with front-end6\nloader turning emitting the most bioaerosols, followed by windrow turner, screening and7\nfinally shredding. Turning at the early stage of composting releases higher bioaerosols8\ncompared with the later stages. During the first weeks, the bioaerosols release rate during9\nturning was between 104 and 107 cfu\/s, compared with 104 to 106cfu\/s for the turning of10\ncompost age from 4 weeks to 16 weeks. This is further evidence of the gradual release of11\nbioaerosols as compost ages detected by the passive sampling described above.12\n13\n3.3 Depletion curves14\nThe source depletion curves generated for the passive and active releases (Figures 4 to15\n7) display a similar trend to analysis conducted by Taha et al. (2006a). The Environment16\nAgency guidance (Environment Agency, 2004) suggests that a typical background17\nconcentration that can be used for comparison is 103 cfu\/m3. As the upwind readings for this18\nsite showed a \u201cno reading\u201d, we will compare the modelled concentrations to the 103 cfu\/m319\nlevel. For the passive releases, the bioaerosol concentration is estimated to be reduced to this20\nlevel at a distance of approximately 100m for Aspergillus fumigatus and 200m for21\nactinomycetes. The agitation activities produce emissions of at least 1-log higher than the22\npassive emissions. Despite this, all active bioaerosol emissions were estimated to be reduced23\nto background levels at a distance of less than 100m. The Environment Agency requires a24\nrisk assessment to be undertaken for any composting facility that has a sensitive receptor25\nTaha, M.P.M., Drew, G.H., Tamer, A., Hewings, G., Jordinson, G.M., Longhurst, P.J., Pollard, S.J.T., Atmospheric\nEnvironment, 41 (21) pp. 4504-4519.\n12\nwithin 250m of its boundary. The results presented here suggest that bioaerosol1\nconcentrations from both active and passive emissions will reduce to below typical2\nbackground levels before reaching the 250m risk assessment requirement threshold.3\nAnalysis of the figures reveals the differences between the two dispersion models4\nused to estimate the source depletion curves. SCREEN3, the screening-level model is shown5\nto be more conservative in its estimation than the advanced ADMS dispersion model. This6\nis most likely due to the inclusion of an alternative mixing height algorithm (Brode, 1991),7\nwhich uses the maximum of a predetermined mixing height or a value adjusted slightly8\nhigher than the plume height, based on stability class. The use of this alternative algorithm9\nresults in concentrations that are more conservative that the USEPA\u2019s full Gaussian10\ndispersion model, ISCST3 (USEPA, 1996). We therefore expect SCREEN3 results to be11\nmore conservative when compared with another advanced Gaussian-like model such as12\nADMS 3.3.13\nADMS predicts that the concentrations will decrease from 0m, while SCREEN314\npredicts an initial increase in concentrations for the passive emissions only, with the15\nmaximum concentration occurring at approximately 40m from the source. This may be due16\nto the different source types used in this study. The passive releases were modelled as area17\nsources, to reflect the entire compost windrow, while the active releases were modelled as18\npoint sources, as by their nature these activities tend to occur at a single point within the19\nfacility.20\nThe ADMS dispersion model has the added capability of modelling more than one21\nsource. This provides a more realistic representation of dispersion from the facility, as each22\nfacility is likely to have several windrows of different ages on site at a single time, along with23\nthe possibility of at least one activity (shredding, screening or turning) occurring each day of24\noperation. Figures 8 (A. fumigatus) and 9 (actinomycetes) show the depletion curves25\nTaha, M.P.M., Drew, G.H., Tamer, A., Hewings, G., Jordinson, G.M., Longhurst, P.J., Pollard, S.J.T., Atmospheric\nEnvironment, 41 (21) pp. 4504-4519.\n13\npredicted by ADMS for three different dates based on the combined passive sources sampled1\non that day. The concentration on all three days reduces to less than background2\nconcentration before the 250m Environment Agency threshold for risk assessments. For A.3\nfumigatus, the maximum concentration is below the background level of 103 cfu\/m3. The4\nconcentrations predicted are also not significantly higher than those for the single sources,5\nwhich could be due to the spacing of the sources within the model\u2019s output grid.6\nFigures 10 and 11 show the source depletion curves for the combined active and7\npassive emissions for the three dates. The maximum concentrations are now within the range8\nof 104 - 105 cfu\/m3, which shows that the active emissions are the main source of bioaerosols9\nat these composting facilities. Despite these initial high concentrations, the depletion curves10\nagain show that concentrations reach typical background levels within the 250m threshold for11\nrisk assessments.12\n13\n3.4 Discussion14\nThe source depletion curves presented are still considered conservative due to the15\nclumping tendency of bioaerosol (physical decay) and deactivation (biological decay) caused16\nby sunlight and heat. Although the clumping tendency of bioaerosols has been discussed in17\nregards to their dispersion (e.g. Wheeler et al., 2001), there is little published research data to18\nsupport any conclusions regarding this tendency, particularly in association with composting19\nfacilities. Previous literature suggests that fungal spores often form clumps when aerosolized20\n(e.g. Lacey, 1991; Trunov et al., 2001), and that these clumps are within respirable size21\n(Karlsson and Malmberg, 1989). The same study has found that clumping was more distinct22\nfor actinomycetes. Wider research has examined the tendency of bacteria and fungi to form23\nclumps in media other than air, such as water and soil (Calleja et al., 1984).24\nTaha, M.P.M., Drew, G.H., Tamer, A., Hewings, G., Jordinson, G.M., Longhurst, P.J., Pollard, S.J.T., Atmospheric\nEnvironment, 41 (21) pp. 4504-4519.\n14\nGiven the limited information regarding aggregation within air, we can only infer the1\npossible characteristics that may be required for bioaerosols to form clumps, based on the2\nexisting literature. The literature suggests that random collision (Calleja et al., 1984) and3\nfaster air velocities (> 0.3 cm\/s) are needed to form aerobic clumps (Tay et al., 2001). The4\nagitation activities that occur at composting facilities (e.g. shredding, turning and screening)5\nproduce sufficient air turbulence to result in random collisions of bioaerosols. Tay et al.6\n(2001) also show that increasing temperatures are likely to increase clumping, suggesting that7\nthe high temperatures generated within compost windrows may encourage bioaerosol8\naggregation above piles, particularly during the more active stages of composting. However,9\nfurther research would be necessary to confirm this suggestion.10\nThe mechanisms behind microbial clumping are linked with the physicochemical11\nproperties of the microbial cells such as surface hydrophobicity and charges on cell walls12\n(Borrego et al., 2000; Dufr\u00eane, 2000; Amanullah, 2001). Bush and Stumm (1968) reveal13\nthat, within the pH range of 5 to 9, bacteria have a net negative charge. The pH within14\ncomposting piles is usually between 6 and 8.5, within this range. Clumps may therefore15\nresult from this negative charge attracting positively charged cell products. It is therefore16\nimportant to begin taking the tendency of bioaerosols to form aggregations into account when17\npredicting their dispersal, as current risk assessments are likely to be over-conservative as a18\nresult. Future work will aim to mimic clumping tendencies when using the advanced19\nmodelling functions in ADMS 3.3, such as the deposition options.20\nBioaerosol viability also requires consideration because studies have shown that non-21\nviable cell wall components, such as endotoxins, may cause adverse health effects (Castellan22\net al., 1987; Kennedy et al., 1987; Eduard, 1993; Eduard, 2001; Lange et al., 2003). The23\nactual fungal cells whether viable or not can prompt an allergenic response. Traditional24\nmonitoring methods capture air samples and then culture the viable bioaerosols from the25\nTaha, M.P.M., Drew, G.H., Tamer, A., Hewings, G., Jordinson, G.M., Longhurst, P.J., Pollard, S.J.T., Atmospheric\nEnvironment, 41 (21) pp. 4504-4519.\n15\nsample. Some of these sampling methods (impaction and impingement) are known to impose1\nsignificant stress on micro-organisms (Lin et al, 2000) and G\u00f3rny et al. (2002) show that a2\nsignificant proportion of bioaerosols released are considerably smaller than the spores3\nreleased from surfaces contaminated with fungi. This might suggest that the non-viable4\ncomponents may be more numerous than the viable components, and that most published5\nbioaerosol concentrations are underestimates of the true emissions. However, the practical6\ndifficulties associated with field sampling of bioaerosol components means that data to7\nsupport this suggestion is not available. Given that dose-response relationships for8\nbioaerosols, are currently not well defined, it would appear prudent for the 250m threshold to9\nremain in place until further evidence is available regarding the dispersal of non-viable10\nbioaerosol components.11\nJones and Harrison (2004) show that meteorological factors (temperature, humidity12\nand solar radiation) effect the dispersal of the airborne micro-organisms, as well as their13\ninitial release. Elevated levels of fungi within buildings are also associated with higher14\ntemperatures and high humidity (Wan and Li, 1998). In addition, solar radiation has been15\nshown to decrease the viability of bioaerosols (Ulevi\u010dius et al, 2000). It is generally accepted16\nthat composting windrows have a high humidity and high temperature, and are excellent17\nenvironments for bioaerosols to proliferate. However, when considering their dispersal, little18\nwork has been done to examine the impact of the ambient environment on bioaerosol19\nviability post-release, partly due to the complications involved in measuring non-viable20\nbioaerosols in the field. Dust measurement and particle size ranges would have helped in21\nsupporting these results, and future work will aim to take this into account using field studies22\nand by exploring the advanced options available in the ADMS 3.3 model.23\n24\n4. Conclusions and future work25\nTaha, M.P.M., Drew, G.H., Tamer, A., Hewings, G., Jordinson, G.M., Longhurst, P.J., Pollard, S.J.T., Atmospheric\nEnvironment, 41 (21) pp. 4504-4519.\n16\nWe have presented data demonstrating the ability to measure the concentration of1\nbioaerosols emitted \u2018at source\u2019 during static conditions and for agitation activities, from2\ncompost of different ages. From these results, we have estimated the emission flux of3\nbioaerosols from compost processing activities, using a simple screening-level dispersion4\nmodel and a more advanced new generation dispersion model. We have previously5\nconcluded that agitation activities result in releases of bioaerosols in the order of two to three6\nlog higher than from static compost windrows (Taha et al., 2006a). The results presented7\nhere add further weight to this conclusion. In addition, we have shown that:8\n\uf0b7 the age of the compost has little effect on the bioaerosols emitted;9\n\uf0b7 the simple screening-level model SCREEN3 provides a conservative estimate of the10\nsource depletion curves of viable bioaerosol emissions;11\n\uf0b7 the more advanced new generation model, ADMS 3.3 can be used to estimate12\nbioaerosol dispersal from composting facilities;13\n\uf0b7 the source depletion curves estimated by both models can still be considered as only14\nconservative estimate of bioaerosol dispersal, as both models are currently not able to15\ntake into account bioaerosol properties such as clumping and inactivation.16\n17\nFuture work will focus on improving measurement techniques for monitoring18\nbioaerosol emissions, focussing on the clumping and inactivation properties. Further studies19\nwill be undertaken to examine the more advanced options within ADMS 3.3 in order to20\nimprove the dispersion modelling techniques. This research will further improve the science21\nbehind current bioaerosol risk assessment methodologies.22\n23\nAcknowledgements24\nTaha, M.P.M., Drew, G.H., Tamer, A., Hewings, G., Jordinson, G.M., Longhurst, P.J., Pollard, S.J.T., Atmospheric\nEnvironment, 41 (21) pp. 4504-4519.\n17\nThis research is partly supported by the Ministry of Health, Malaysia.
