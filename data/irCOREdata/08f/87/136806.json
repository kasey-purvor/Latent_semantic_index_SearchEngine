Any deviation or acceleration\nof a moving object is therefore indicative of some external event\nhaving taken place. It is often necessary for humans to use their\nsense of vision to signal such events and to make revised motor\nactions in order to either intercept the moving object or else to avoid\nit, should its new direction pose a threat. Given the importance of\ndetecting deviations in the path of moving objects, it is surprising\nthat the mechanisms involved in this task are poorly understood.\nEvidence does exist to suggest that our sensitivity to path\ndeviation should be fairly high. For example, Westheimer and\nWehrhahn [1] investigated the ability to discriminate differences in\nthe direction of a moving dot from one presentation to the next.\nDifferences of less than 1u could be reliably discriminated, a value\nwhich is close to that obtained for the discrimination of orientation\nfor continuous lines. This raises the intriguing question of whether\njudgments about paths of motion are based upon some form of\nstatic memory trace (or \u2018motion smear\u2019 [2\u20135]), upon which\nsubsequent spatial discriminations can be judged.\nMovie S1 depicts the type of moving object which forms the basis\nfor the judgments which we measured. An object (a Gaussian blob\nof a certain size) begins its motion path to the left of the midline\n(defined by static vertical lines at the centre of the figure). It moves\nrightwards on a linear path with a certain velocity until the midline,\nat which stage it suddenly changes its direction, either upwards or\ndownwards. Tripathy and Barrett [6,7] have used a similar\nparadigm, but with emphasis upon the tracking of multiple dots,\nwhere observers were required to identify the direction of deviation\nof a single target dot among several non-deviating distracters. In one\nexperiment, Tripathy and Barrett [7] examined thresholds for path\ndeviation of a single dot and observed thresholds of approximately\n2u, provided dot velocity was high. Several studies have examined\npath deviation in terms of reaction time (RT, [8\u201310]). Observers are\npresented with a moving object which undergoes a suprathreshold\ndeviation in path direction and observers are required to make a\nsimple or choice reaction to the event. For example, Hohnsbein and\nMateeff [9] found that RTs reduced both with the angle of direction\nchange and increasing stimulus velocity.\nThis type of task lends itself to the consideration of several\nparameters, all of which correspond to the variations in the\ncharacteristics of moving objects we encounter in the real world.\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 April 2008 | Volume 3 | Issue 4 | e1930\nObjects vary in size and velocity, both as a result of their physical\nproperties and their distance from the observer. The extent of the\npath of a moving object is also variable, highlighting the fact that a\ntwo-dimensional analysis of the world is the problem faced by the\nvisual system in this type of task [11]. We avoided the third\ndimension by restricting our investigation to path deviations in the\nfronto-parallel plane. Furthermore, observers may not always have\nthe luxury of a lengthy, unhurried period during which pre- and\npost-deviation directions can be evaluated. In many sports, in\nparticular, performance depends upon a rapid assessment of\ndirection change in order to make successful motor adjustments.\nFigure 1 (A\u2013D) depicts the static traces of a variety of object sizes\nand motion paths investigated in the current study.\nWe attempted to characterize the mechanisms involved in the\ndetection of path deviation of moving objects by systematically\nexamining the effects of stimulus size, velocity and path length. We\nalso compared performance for moving objects with that for a static\ntrace of the motion path, and this has allowed us to answer the\nquestion of whether similar mechanisms are involved in both tasks.\nResults\nExperiment 1\nWe begin by presenting data for the static stimuli in order to\nprovide a baseline data set against which path deviation thresholds\nfor the moving blobs can be compared. Figure 2 shows thresholds\nfor detecting a \u2018kink\u2019 in lines such as those presented in Figure 1\n(A\u2013D) as a function of the overall length of the line. Data are\npresented for three levels of blur (s=2\u2019, 5.65\u2019 or 16\u2019arc).\nFor the lowest blur level (solid lines\u2013circle symbols), perfor-\nmance improves with line length but soon reaches a plateau at just\nunder 1u. As blur level increases, performance deteriorates\nmarkedly at short line lengths but, as line length increases,\nthresholds improve steadily to approach the threshold plateau for\nthe lowest blur level. Note, however, that for the largest blur level,\nwe were unable to produce sufficiently long line lengths in order to\nexpose a definitive plateau. Nevertheless, the data suggest that,\nprovided line length is increased sufficiently, then thresholds\nbecome independent of blur level. The data suggest a process of\n\u2018scale invariance\u2019 in which stimuli which are magnified versions of\none another (i.e. scaled in every respect\u2013in this case both length\nand blur) produce identical levels of performance. This can be\nevaluated by replotting the data of Figure 2 on a scale invariant\nabscissa, namely line length divided by blur level. This is shown in\nFigure 3.\nThis procedure has the effect of collapsing together the data at\ndifferent blur levels (although there remains a superiority of\nperformance at the lowest blur level for observer GK). However,\nthe overall success of this type of scaling indicates that any two\nstimuli of identical geometry (same ratio of line length to blur) will\nproduce the same level of performance irrespective of the absolute\nsize of the stimulus.\nFor each observer, the best-fitting bilinear fit to the log\/log data\nis shown, with the constraint that the gradient of the linear fit at\nFigure 1. Examples of stimuli. In Experiment 1, stimuli were straight lines with a deviation or \u2018kink\u2019 at their midpoint (indicated by white vertical\nmarkers). Observers had to indicate the direction of deviation as either \u2018upwards\u2019 (panels A and B) or \u2018downwards\u2019 (C and D). The parameters that\nwere varied were line length and blur. In Experiments 2 and 3, stimuli were \u2018blobs\u2019, which moved rightwards on a linear path with a certain velocity\nuntil the midline, at which stage a deviation in the trajectory occurred. Observers again had to signal the direction of deviation. The lines in panels A-\nD can be considered as a schematic representation of the path traced out by the moving blobs. For the moving stimuli, path length, stimulus blur\nand viewing distance were varied.\ndoi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0001930.g001\nPath Deviation Discrimination\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 April 2008 | Volume 3 | Issue 4 | e1930\nhigh ratios is zero (i.e. performance has reached a plateau). This\nplateau occurs just below 1u (0.90u for DW; 0.91u for DL; 0.73u for\nGK). The result of scaling the data in this way, and the subsequent\nbilinear curve fit accounts for 90% (DW), 89% (DL) and 89%\n(GK) of the total variance in the data. This indicates that the task\nof discriminating a deviation from linearity in a straight line is well\ndescribed by a scale invariant mechanism, in which performance\nplateaus once line length exceeds approximately 40 times the level\nof blur of the line (the \u2018knee\u2019 point).\nExperiment 2\nWe next measured performance for discriminating path\ndeviation for a moving blob as shown in Movie S1. Viewing\ndistance was fixed whilst the size of blob was varied on the screen.\nThree blob sizes were investigated (s=2\u2019, 5.65\u2019 or 16\u2019arc) whilst\nstimulus velocity was held constant at 3.5u\/s. Path deviation\nthresholds for the three stimulus sizes are shown as a function of\npath length in Figure 4. A very different pattern of behavior\nemerges in comparison to the static line deviation judgments.\nFirstly, thresholds are considerably higher and fail to reach a\nplateau even at very long path lengths. Most significantly,\nperformance exhibits no systematic dependence upon blob size\u2013\nfor any given path length thresholds are almost independent of\nblur. This represents the exact opposite trend to the scale invariant\nnature of static line deviation judgments (Figures 2 and 3) in which\nperformance was directly proportional to the level of blur.\nThresholds are well described by a power function (straight line\non log\/log coordinates). The exponent of the power function,\naveraged across blur levels and observers, is 20.5860.07,\nindicating an approximate square root relationship between\nperformance and path length. One interpretation of these findings\nis that, for any given path length, some factor other than stimulus\nblur represents the limit to performance, hence the lack of effect of\nblur. The following experiment was designed to determine the\nnature of this limitation.\nExperiment 3\nWhen objects are in motion in the real world, then variations in\nobserver-object distance (as produced by self-motion towards the\nobject) change the two-dimensional spatial characteristics of the\nobject. If the viewing distance is halved, then for an object moving\nover a fixed physical distance, the object both doubles in size and\nthe visual angle subtended by the motion path doubles. In\naddition, however, the angular velocity of motion doubles. The\nstimuli in Experiment 2 possessed a fixed velocity and so it could\nbe argued that, whilst the stimuli accounted for scale invariance in\nFigure 3. Scale invariance in detecting deviations in static lines. The data from Figure 2 are replotted on a \u2018scale invariant\u2019 abscissa, namely\nline length divided by blur. This collapses together the data at different blur levels and indicates that any two stimuli with identical geometry (same\nratio of line length\/blur) will produce the same level of performance, irrespective of the absolute size of the stimulus. For each observer, data are\nfitted with a bilinear function. These line fits indicate that the task of discriminating a deviation from linearity in a straight line is well described by a\nscale invariant mechanism in which performance reaches a plateau once line length exceeds approximately 40 times the level of blur of the line (the\n\u2018knee\u2019 point).\ndoi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0001930.g003\nFigure 2. Angular discrimination thresholds for static lines. Thresholds for detecting deviations in straight lines, such as those in Figure 1, are\nplotted against line length. Each panel shows data for an individual observer and each symbol type represents a different level of line blur (s= 2\u2019,\ncircles; s= 5.65\u2019, squares; s= 16\u2019, crosses). For the lowest blur level, performance improves with increasing line length and reaches a plateau of\napproximately 1u. As blur level increases, performance deteriorates for short line lengths but, as line length increases, thresholds improve to approach\nthe threshold plateau for the lowest blur level. This suggests that, provided the line length is sufficiently long, thresholds are independent of blur\nlevel. This suggests a process of \u2018scale invariance\u2019, in which stimuli which are magnified versions of one another yield identical levels of performance.\ndoi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0001930.g002\nPath Deviation Discrimination\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 April 2008 | Volume 3 | Issue 4 | e1930\nthe spatial domain (a range of stimulus sizes and path lengths were\nexamined), the temporal aspects of scale invariance were ignored.\nIn this experiment we took this into account. The simplest way\nin which to produce a comprehensive set of scale invariant stimuli\nis to mimic what happens in the real world\u2013maintain a number of\nstimuli of fixed size on the monitor and simply vary viewing\ndistance. We therefore took the medium blur level stimulus series\nfrom Experiment 2 (square symbols in Figure 4) and examined\npath deviation thresholds at four different viewing distances. The\nresults are shown in Figure 5.\nAt all viewing distances, thresholds improve with increasing\npath length of motion. At the shortest viewing distance, and hence\nlargest size and highest velocity (cross symbols), longer path lengths\nare required to produce equivalent angular path deviation\nthresholds. As in Figure 3 for the static line task, we could have\ncollapsed the data by expressing path length as a proportion of\nstimulus size (blur). However, Experiment 2 tells us that stimulus\nblur is not the limiting factor to performance for discriminating\ndeviation of these moving blobs. Instead, the higher stimulus\nvelocity of the larger stimuli must be responsible for the variation\nin threshold at any given path length. This is taken into account in\nFigure 6 by expressing path length as a proportion of stimulus\nvelocity. This proportion effectively reduces to the duration of the\nentire motion path in seconds, and has the effect of collapsing\ntogether data from different viewing distances.\nThus, irrespective of the path length, stimulus blur or velocity of\nmotion, thresholds for discrimination of the angular deviation of a\nmoving object depend upon the duration of the motion path in\nseconds. The data in Figure 6 are fitted with a power function,\nwhose exponent, averaged across observers, is 20.5660.12,\nindicating that deviation thresholds are approximately inversely\nproportional to the square root of path duration.\nA control experiment was performed to ensure that this finding\nwas not somehow an artifact of viewing distance. We therefore\nmaintained viewing distance whilst varying the physical on-display\nvelocity of a fixed-size blob. Figure 7 shows data for two of the\nobservers. Panels A and B show that deviation thresholds are\ndependent upon velocity for a given path length but, when plotted\nagainst duration of motion path (panels C and D), thresholds for\neach velocity collapse together. Again, the results are consistent\nwith a square-root relationship since the power function describing\nthe relationship has an exponent of 20.51 (DW) and 20.58 (GK).\nDiscussion\nThresholds for the discrimination of an angular deviation within\na static line stimulus improve with line length until reaching a\nplateau at just under 1u. Lines that possess the same ratio of\nlength-to-blur result in the same angular deviation threshold.\nFigure 4. Path deviation thresholds for moving \u2018blobs\u2019. Thresholds for detecting a deviation in the path of a moving blob are plotted against\npath length. Individual panels show data for a single observer, and different symbols represent different levels of stimulus blur (s=2\u2019, circles;\ns= 5.65\u2019, squares; s=16\u2019, crosses). Thresholds are considerably higher than those found for static line deviation judgments and fail to reach a plateau\neven at very long path lengths. Additionally, performance is not dependent on blob size: for any given path length thresholds are independent of\nblur. Data for each blur level are fitted by a power function whose exponent, averaged across blur levels and observers, is -0.5860.07, indicating an\napproximate square root relationship between performance and path length. The data suggest that, for any given path length, some factor other\nthan stimulus blur represents the limit to performance.\ndoi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0001930.g004\nFigure 5. Path deviation thresholds for different viewing distances. Path deviation thresholds for moving blobs with a blur level of s= 5.65\u2019\narc were measured at 4 viewing distances (VD), and are plotted against path length. Each panel shows data for a single observer and different\nsymbols represent different distances. At all viewing distances, thresholds improve with increasing path length. At the shortest viewing distance\n(crosses), and hence largest size and highest velocity, longer path lengths are required to produce equivalent angular path deviation thresholds.\ndoi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0001930.g005\nPath Deviation Discrimination\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 April 2008 | Volume 3 | Issue 4 | e1930\nThese results are straightforward to explain in the context of self-\nsimilar visual filters whose size is determined by stimulus blur (e.g.\n[12,13]). For example, Figure 8A shows a receptive field\narrangement which would produce a strong differential response\nto a deviation of a line dependent upon its direction of deviation.\nShorter lines are clearly unsuited to produce the same differential\nresponse (Figure 8B), whilst lines which extend beyond the filter\nresult in no additional benefit (Figure 8C), hence the plateau in\nperformance at very long line lengths (Figure 3). Spatially scaled\nversions of the filters result in the same level of performance\n(Figure 8D). Scale invariance is a pervasive property of human\nvision, and holds for positional acuities [14,15], visual illusions\n[16,17] and texture discrimination [18\u201321], in addition to the\nangular judgments examined here.\nFigure 6. Relationship between path deviation thresholds and path duration. The path deviation thresholds from Figure 5 are replotted\nagainst an abscissa of path length\/stimulus velocity. This ratio is equivalent to the duration of the motion path in seconds, and this has the effect of\ncollapsing together data from different viewing distances. This indicates that, irrespective of the path length, stimulus blur or velocity of motion, path\ndeviation thresholds depend upon the duration of the motion path in seconds. For each observer, the data are fitted with a power function, whose\nexponent, averaged across observers, is 0.5660.12, indicating that deviation thresholds are approximately inversely proportional to the square root\nof path duration.\ndoi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0001930.g006\nFigure 7. Path deviation thresholds for different stimulus velocities. Path deviation thresholds for moving blobs with a blur level of s= 5.65\u2019\narc were measured at a viewing distance of 54 cm for 3 velocities (v). Panels A and B each show data for a single observer, plotted against path\nlength, and different symbols represent different velocities. At all velocities, thresholds improve with increasing path length. As velocity increases,\nperformance for any given path length is generally poorer. In panels C and D, the data from A and B are replotted against an abscissa of path length\/\nstimulus velocity. This collapses together the data for different velocities and confirms that any two stimuli which are displayed for the same duration\n(same ratio of path length\/velocity) will produce the same level of performance.\ndoi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0001930.g007\nPath Deviation Discrimination\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 5 April 2008 | Volume 3 | Issue 4 | e1930\nThe current data for static line deviation are remarkably similar\nto performance in both single line orientation and curvature\ndiscrimination tasks [22,23]. Both orientation and curvature\nthresholds (when defined in angular terms) demonstrate scale\ninvariance in that performance across a range of blur levels and\nline lengths collapse together as function of stimulus length divided\nby blur. The same trend is shown, with performance improving\nwith line length before reaching a plateau. Optimum thresholds\nranging from just over 1u [22] to just over 0.5u [23] are also similar\nto the optimum angular deviation thresholds found in the present\nstudy (Figure 3).\nThe path deviation thresholds for the moving stimuli are far\nmore intriguing. Experiment 2 tells us that, whatever the\nmechanism involved, it is not tuned to the level of blur in the\nstimulus\u2013a result which is diametrically opposite to that for the\nstatic line deviations of Experiment 1. This result, along with the\nrelatively poor angular deviation thresholds (note that the scale of\nthe y-axis in Figure 4 is an order of magnitude greater than in\nFigure 3), suggests that the analysis of path deviation for moving\nobjects is determined by a large, fixed size filter which cares little\nabout stimulus blur until this reaches extreme levels. Experiment 3\nindicates that stimulus velocity is the critical factor determining\npath deviation thresholds at any given path length. A form of scale\ninvariance is again exhibited (Figure 6), but this time in the\ntemporal domain, reflecting the fact that the retinal velocity of a\nmoving object varies with viewing distance. Once velocity is\naccounted for, we are left with the simple, if rather surprising,\nconclusion that path deviation thresholds depend solely upon the\ntemporal duration of the motion path. Whilst deviation perfor-\nmance does improve with both longer paths and slower velocities\n(Figure 5), it does so only because both of these factors tend to\nproduce longer durations of motion. When these two factors are\ncombined to form path duration, data from a variety of different\nconditions collapse to form a single function, in which longer\ndurations result in better performance.\nWhat other evidence exists to suggest that path duration\nrepresents the determining factor in the analysis of path deviation?\nSekuler et al. [24] measured simple reaction times (RTs) to large\n(30u) path deviations for objects moving at various velocities (2, 4\nor 8u\/s). They found that reaction times for different velocities\ncollapsed together when expressed in terms of the duration of the\npre-deviation path rather than its spatial extent. Their conclusion\nwas that the visual system requires time to extract a sufficiently\nprecise estimate of pre-deviation direction in order to react to a\nchange in this direction. Sekuler et al. [24] present evidence to\nindicate that this form of global recruitment of direction continues\nacross a relatively lengthy timescale of 500\u2013700 ms pre-deviation\nduration. We present our data in terms of the total path duration\n(Figure 6), so our values need to be halved to correspond to pre-\ndeviation duration, but our data confirm the view that estimates of\nmotion direction continue to improve until 700 ms at least.\nFurther support for this rather lengthy process comes from studies\nwhich have investigated the detection of a single dot moving along\na consistent trajectory within random-direction dot noise [25,26].\nFigure 8. Modeling of angular discrimination performance for static lines. The results of Experiment 1 can be explained in the context of\nself-similar visual filters whose size is determined by stimulus blur. Panel A shows a receptive field arrangement which would produce a strong\ndifferential response to a deviation of a line dependent upon its direction of deviation. Filter size is determined by the stimulus blur. Shorter lines are\nclearly unsuited to produce the same differential response (B), whilst lines which extend beyond the filter result in no additional benefit (C). This\nexplains the plateau in performance at very long line lengths (Figure 3). Spatially scaled versions of the filters result in the same level of performance\n(D).\ndoi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0001930.g008\nPath Deviation Discrimination\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 6 April 2008 | Volume 3 | Issue 4 | e1930\nDetection performance is found to improve over durations\nextending to at least 600 ms [26] and is best described by a\n\u2018cascade\u2019 of motion detectors which, when activated, facilitate\ndetectors tuned to a similar direction and whose receptive fields\nfollow the path of the motion. Krekelberg and Lappe [27] also\npresent evidence in terms of the positional misperception of\nmoving dots to indicate that temporal recruitment along the\ntrajectory of a moving object continues to at least 500 ms\nduration.\nIn terms of our path deviation task, we propose that the internal\nestimates of both pre- and post-deviation paths become more precise\n(less noisy) as duration increases, through an integration of directional\ninformation corresponding to the trajectory path. Contrary to the\nstatic condition, however, this is not a spatial integration of\ninformation as is known to improve line orientation judgments\n[28,29]. Rather, it is a temporal integration of information which\nallows the observer to reconstruct an accurate measure of the\ndirection of travel. The more time available, the better the estimate\nbecomes, irrespective of the extent or velocity of travel alone. Local\nprocessing of motion direction is most likely obtained at various\npositions along the trajectory path by direction-selective simple cells\nin V1. At a later stage, the extracted motion energy samples are\nintegrated across orientation and two-dimensional space in order to\nrecover the global motion path. It is at this stage, presumably the\nmiddle temporal visual area (MT), where the directional quality of the\nglobal motion signal is enhanced by summation across time. The\napproximately square root relationship between performance and\npath duration is close to ideal, and suggests that this summation of\nindependent time samples is very efficient.\nOur results cannot be explained on the basis of temporal\nintegration creating a static spatial \u2018streak\u2019 on which to base\ndirectional motion judgments [2\u20135,30]. This is despite the fact that\nwe used suitably high motion velocities [5]. Our reasoning is\nstraightforward\u2013that the behavior of discrimination thresholds for\nmoving stimuli (Experiments 2 and 3) exhibit such a completely\ndifferent pattern to that for static representations of the motion\npath (Experiment 1). This is inconsistent with a common spatial\nmechanism potentially afforded by motion \u2018streaks\u2019. Watamaniuk\n[31] also argues against a similar explanation for performance in a\ntask where part of a dot\u2019s trajectory is occluded.\nThe motion paths which we used were all symmetric about the\nmidline in terms of their duration and spatial extent. It would be\ninteresting to vary the extents of the pre- and post-deviation paths\nindependently to examine their relative importance in deviation\ndiscrimination. At the extremes, of course, both paths have the\npotential to limit performance. It is no good having a very accurate\nestimate of post-deviation path direction if pre-deviation direction\nis highly uncertain, and vice versa. This issue warrants further\ninvestigation.\nIn summary, path deviation discrimination for static lines and\nmoving blobs involves completely different mechanisms. Perfor-\nmance for discriminating a deviation in a line is entirely consistent\nwith well-established scale-invariant models incorporating spatial\nvisual filters. Path deviation for moving blobs involves a global\nmechanism that recruits local motion detectors sharing common\ndirectional selectivity, whose activity defines the pre- and post-\ndeviation path, and hence the direction of deviation. The limit to\nperformance is determined neither by extent of motion path nor\nby velocity, but by the duration of the motion path.\nMaterials and Methods\nThe three authors, all of whom had normal vision, participated\nin the experiments. DW and DL gathered data at Berkeley whilst\nobserver GK gathered data at Bradford. The Berkeley stimuli\nwere displayed on a Sony Multiscan G400 monitor with a\nMacintosh G4 as host computer. The corresponding apparatus at\nBradford was an Apple LCD Cinema Display and a Macintosh\nG4. Stimuli were generated using the macro capabilities of NIH\nImage (v1.61) and were presented against a grey background of\nluminance 41 cd\/m2. The standard viewing distance was 93 cm\n(Berkeley) or 107 cm (Bradford) in order to produce a common\ninter-pixel angular subtense of 1\u2019arc. In Experiment 3, four\ndifferent viewing distances were used (186 cm, 93 cm, 46 cm and\n23 cm at Berkeley; 214 cm, 107 cm, 54 cm, 27 cm at Bradford).\nThe moving stimuli were Gaussian blobs of 0.99 Weber contrast\nwhose standard deviation (s) was varied in order to produce\nstimuli of different size. The blobs moved from left to right across\nthe screen (Movie S1) until the midline (defined by two vertical\nlines 1\u2019arc wide and 128\u2019 arc in length leaving a vertical gap of\n256\u2019arc between them). The initial path direction of the blobs was\nrandomized from trial-to-trial with the constraint that this was\nwithin 35u either side of the horizontal. The vertical position of the\nblob at the horizontal midline was always mid-way between the\ntwo vertical reference lines. At this point the path direction of the\nblob could change, either deviating upwards or downwards, but\nmaintaining the same linear velocity as pre-deviation. On any\ntrial, one of seven equally spaced deviations could be presented:\n23, 22, 21, 0, 1, 2 or 3 multiples of step size, where negative\nvalues indicate upward deviations, positive values represent\ndownwards. These seven levels were randomly interleaved within\na method of constant stimuli. After each trial, observers responded\nas to whether they thought the direction of deviation was upwards\nor downwards. Angular step size was chosen such that responses\nranged from approximately 100% upwards to 100% downwards.\nResulting data (from a minimum of 20 trials at each stimulus level)\nwere fitted with a logistic function of the form:\ny~\n100\n1ze\n(x{m)\nh\nwhere y is the percentage of \u2018upwards\u2019 responses to a given\ndeviation (x), m is the deviation resulting in 50% upwards responses\nand h is an estimate of threshold deviation (approximately half the\ndistance between the 73% and 27% \u2018upward\u2019 response levels).\nThreshold deviations were established for a range of velocities,\nblob sizes (defined by the s of the Gaussian luminance profile) and\npath lengths (the overall distance travelled in degrees of visual\nangle).\nStatic stimuli were also produced, representing the trace of the\nmoving blob during its motion path. Essentially this produces a\nstraight line with a \u2018kink\u2019 at the midpoint where the line either\ndeviates upwards or downwards. The observers were simply asked\nto judge whether the line deviated upwards or downwards to the\nright of the horizontal midline. Again, a variety of blur (size) levels\nand path lengths were produced (obviously velocity is not a\nrelevant parameter for these stimuli), and examples are provided\nin Figure 1 (A\u2013D). Exposure duration for these static stimuli was\nfixed at 250 ms. Pilot data indicated that this was sufficiently long\nto allow observers to reach optimum performance under all\nconditions. In other words, thresholds are not limited by exposure\nduration and reflect the limits imposed by other factors such as size\nand path length.\nSupporting Information\nMovie S1 An example of the moving stimulus.
