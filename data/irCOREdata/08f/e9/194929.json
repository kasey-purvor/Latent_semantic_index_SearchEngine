Rabbit hearts were perfused in a Langendorff apparatus with full sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation and were optically mapped to measure action potential durations and DOR (apex\u2013base) over the left ventricles. DOR was measured under sinus rhythm, during bilateral sympathetic nerve stimulation (SNS) and right and\/or left vagus nerve stimulation and was compared with DOR during isoproterenol (100 nmol\/L) or acetylcholine (1 \u03bcmol\/L) infusion. In sinus rhythm, repolarization started at the apex and systematically progressed toward the base. SNS (10 to 15 Hz) increased DOR by 29% (from \u0394action potential duration=17\u00b10.7 to \u221222\u00b11.6 ms, n=6) and reversed DOR as the direction of repolarization from apex\u2192base in sinus rhythm shifted to base\u2192apex in 5 to 15 seconds after SNS. DOR flipped back to its sinus rhythm DOR pattern 115\u00b115 seconds after the interruption of SNS.

Rabbit hearts were perfused in a Langendorff apparatus with full sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation\nand were optically mapped to measure action potential durations and DOR (apex\u2013base) over the left ventricles. DOR\nwas measured under sinus rhythm, during bilateral sympathetic nerve stimulation (SNS) and right and\/or left vagus\nnerve stimulation and was compared with DOR during isoproterenol (100 nmol\/L) or acetylcholine (1 \u0001mol\/L) infusion.\nIn sinus rhythm, repolarization started at the apex and systematically progressed toward the base. SNS (10 to 15 Hz)\nincreased DOR by 29% (from \u0001action potential duration\u000217\u00030.7 to \u000422\u00031.6 ms, n\u00026) and reversed DOR as the\ndirection of repolarization from apex3base in sinus rhythm shifted to base3apex in 5 to 15 seconds after SNS. DOR\nflipped back to its sinus rhythm DOR pattern 115\u000315 seconds after the interruption of SNS. During right or left vagus nerve\nstimulation, there was no change in the direction of DOR, but bilateral vagus nerve stimulation increased and reversed DOR\nto base3apex direction. Infusion of isoproterenol or acetylcholine increased DOR but did not alter the direction of\nrepolarization sequences. These findings demonstrate that bilateral autonomic activity (SNS or vagus nerve stimulation) cause\nreversible shifts of apex\u2013base DOR and that the spatial heterogeneities of autonomic effects on the ventricles are most likely\nattributable to a greater innervation at the base than the apex of the heart.

At the cellular\nlevel, repolarization is determined by the current amplitudes\nand activation and inactivation kinetics of ion channels,\nwhich in most mammalian hearts include: voltage-gated Na\u0005\n(INa) and L-type Ca2\u0005 (ICa,L) channels, the fast and slow\ncomponents of delayed rectifier K\u0005 channels (IKr and IKs), and\nthe fast component of the transient K\u0005 channel (Ito,f).1\u20134 At the\norgan level, the dispersion of repolarization (DOR) is a\nmeasure of the nonuniformity of repolarization, most likely\ncaused by regional differences in ion channel distribution\nfrom endocardium to epicardium5\u20137 and along the epicardium\nfrom apex to base of the ventricles.8\u201311\nIn hearts under sinus rhythm, repolarization sequences\nhave been obtained from the surface of mouse,12,13 guinea\npig,14\u201317 and rabbit18,19 hearts using optical mapping tech-\nniques. In all animal models tested thus far, repolarization\nwas shown to proceed from the apex to the base of the heart\nand to be independent of the activation sequence and to\ndepend on intrinsic differences of action potential durations\n(APDs).20 Transmural DOR was measured from isolated\ncanine wedge preparations and found to differ significantly\nwhen paced on the endocardium (to mimic sinus rhythm)\ncompared with epicardium.21\nIn vivo, adrenergic regulation of the heart occurs by 2\ndominant mechanisms: (1) direct delivery of catecholamine\nthrough sympathetic nerve activity and (2) humoral secretion\nof catecholamine in the circulation by the adrenal glands.\nHumoral actions of catecholamine on cardiac electrophysiol-\nogy can be investigated by infusing adrenergic agonists in the\nperfusion solution in animal studies or injections in the blood\nstream of volunteers.22,23 In contrast, studies on the effects of\nautonomic nerve activity on APD are sparse.24 and there are\nno reports on the neuromodulation of DOR.\nEnhanced DOR and dynamic properties of APDs such as\nthe steepness of the APD restitution kinetics curve and APD\n(or T wave) alternans have been shown to promote arrhyth-\nmias.25\u201327 Adrenergic agonists and\/or autonomic imbalance\nOriginal received January 16, 2007; revision received March 1, 2007; accepted March 7, 2007.\nFrom the Department of Cardiovascular Sciences (R.M., G.A.N.), Cardiology Group, University of Leicester, UK; and Departments of Pharmacology\n(W.C.d.G.) and Cell Biology and Physiology (R.M., B.G., T.L., B.-R.C., G.S.), University of Pittsburgh, Pa.

The arrangement improved the staining of the\nheart with a voltage-sensitive dye and the delivery drugs\nwhile retaining functional sympathetic and parasympathetic\ninnervation for several hours. APDs and DOR were measured\nduring bilateral sympathetic nerve stimulation (SNS) or during\nright or left or bilateral vagus nerve stimulation (VNS). Changes\nin bipolar electrograms and optical maps of APDs were mea-\nsured continuously for up to 10 minutes before, during, and after\nSNS or VNS. The combination of optical mapping and intact,\nfully innervated heart preparation provide a unique tool to\ninvestigate important topics in neurocardiology.\nMaterials and Methods\nHeart Preparations\nFully innervated rabbit hearts were isolated using a modified method\nof that described by Ng et al.24 Briefly, adult New Zealand White\nrabbits (3.5 to 4 kg, n\u000214) were premedicated with ketamine HCl\n(0.1 mg kg\u00041, SC; Hospira Inc) and Meditomidine (1 mg, SC; Pfizer)\nfollowed by general anesthesia induced and maintained by Diprivan\n(1 to 2 mg kg\u00041 IV; Astra Zeneca). Rabbits were ventilated after\ntracheotomy using a small-animal ventilator (60 breaths per minute;\nHarvard Apparatus Ltd, Edenbridge, Kent, UK) with an O2\/air\nmixture. The vagus nerves were isolated, and the blood vessels\nleading to and from the ribcage were ligated and dissected. The rabbit\nwas euthanized with sodium pentobarbital and portions of the rib cage\nwere removed and the descending aorta was cannulated. The\npericardium was cut, and ice-cold Tyrode\u2019s solution was applied to\nthe surface of the heart to preserve myocardial function. The\npreparation extending from the neck to thorax was dissected from\nsurrounding tissues as described previously.24 An advantage of this\nnerve\u2013heart preparation is that the peripheral vessels and barore-\nflexes are eliminated when the spinal cord is severed below the\nMedulla oblongata, and the heart and part of the rib cage are isolated\n(see Figure 1). All procedures were undertaken in accordance with the\nAnimals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and the current Guide for the\nCare and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the National\nInstitutes of Health (NIH Publication No. 85-23, revised 1985).\nA new method was devised to improve dye and drug delivery to\nthe heart and improve cardiac perfusion pressure and coronary flow\nrate. Two perfusion circuits were set up with 2 peristaltic pumps.\nOne pump perfused the spinal cord from the descending aorta to the\nspinal artery, at low flow rates (10 to 15 mL\/min). The other perfused\nthe heart in a modified Langendorff apparatus at a higher constant\nflow rate (30 mL\/min) by inserting a 5 French catheter (B. Braun\nMedical Inc, Bethlehem, Pa) up the ascending aorta above the aortic\nvalve and inflating the balloon catheter to maintain perfusion\npressure to the heart (65\u00035 mm Hg) and to separate the two\nperfusion circuits. This approach was critical to stain the heart with\nthe voltage-sensitive dye, obtain reproducible drug actions at rea-\nsonable concentrations, and achieve physiological perfusion pres-\nsures to the heart and the spinal cord. The heart and nerves were\nperfused with Tyrode\u2019s solution containing (in mmol\/L): 130 NaCl,\n24 NaHCO3, 1.0 CaCl2, 1.0 MgCl2, 4.0 KCl, 1.2 NaH2PO4, 20\ndextrose, at pH 7.4, and gassed with 95% O2 plus 5% CO2 at\n37\u00031\u00b0C. Hearts were stained with the voltage sensitive dye, di-4\nANEPPS (40 \u0001L of a 1 mg\/mL stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide).\nTwo methods were used in combination to reduce motion artifacts.\n(1) The heart was placed horizontally in a custom designed chamber\nwith an adjustable base and 2 straps to hold a glass slide against the\nregion of epicardium to mechanical immobilize the region viewed by\nthe photodiode array (Figure 1). (2) Cytochalasin D was used\nsparingly at 2 \u0001mol\/L in the perfusate for 10 minutes, followed by\nwashout. When applied in this manner, cytochalasin D reduced\ncontractions for 20 to 30 minutes without altering action potential\n(AP) characteristics, conduction velocity, or repolarization.\nOptical Apparatus\nThe optical apparatus was previously described.18 Briefly, light from\ntwo 100-W tungsten\u2013halogen lamps was collimated and passed\nthrough 520\u000330-nm interference filters. Fluorescence emitted from\nthe stained heart was collected with a camera lens. Fluorescence\nemission from the anterior region of heart was passed through a\ncutoff filter (610 nm; Omega Optical, Brattleboro, Vt) and focused\non a 16\u000616 elements photodiode array (C4675-103; Hamamatsu\nCorp, Bridgewater, NJ) (Figure 1). Outputs from the photodiode\narray were amplified, digitized (14-bit) at 2000 frames per second\n(Microstar Laboratories Inc, Bellevue, Wash) and were acquired for\nat least 40 seconds for subsequent data analysis.\nNerve Stimulation and Image\nAcquisition Protocols\nSympathetic Nerve Stimulation\nA quadripolar electrode was inserted in the spinal canal at the 12th\nthoracic vertebra, and the tip was advanced to the level of the second\nthoracic vertebra to stimulate cardiac sympathetic outflow. From\nprevious reports, SNS and VNS tolerated stimulation frequencies of\nup to 20 Hz and 15 V, without noticeable run down of the autonomic\nresponses, measured as changes in heart rate and developed pres-\nsure.24 In this study, SNS were kept at a submaximal stimulation\nstrength of 15 Hz and 15 V for 50 seconds or until the maximum\nchange of heart rate occurred24; then the stimulus was turned off to\nallow heart rate to return to baseline. Vagus nerves were stimulated\nindividually (right or left) or simultaneously with silver chloride\nbipolar electrodes (15 V, 15Hz for 5 seconds) producing a drop in the\nheart rate to \u0007100 bpm. A stimulus generator was custom made in\nthe electronic shop of University of Pittsburgh to control the stimuli\nfrom 1 to 20 V and 1 to 20 Hz.\nData Analysis\nAPDs were measured from the optical APs recorded at each site from\nthe difference between the activation and repolarization time points,\nas previously described.15 The activation time point was calculated\nfrom the maximum first derivative of the AP upstroke (dF\/dt)max,\nwhich represented the time when most of the cells viewed by a diode\nfired an AP and the repolarization time point was calculated from the\nmaximum second derivative of the AP downstroke, (d2F\/dt2)max.15\nWe previously showed that the inflection point, (d2F\/dt2)max, repre-\nsents the refractory period of the AP based on extra stimuli applied\nat 1.5\u0006 threshold voltage. The second derivative fell at 97% and\n90% to 96% recovery to baseline for APs recorded, respectively,\nwith a microelectrode or optically.15 In hearts with a prominent plateau\nphase, such as the rabbit (but not the mouse or rat AP), the maximum\nsecond derivative of the AP downstroke provided a unique time point\nthat is not distorted by motion artifacts. In addition, the second\nMantravadi et al Neural Modulation of Ventricular Repolarization e73\n at University of Leicester (lei) \/ England on August 19, 2013http:\/\/circres.ahajournals.org\/Downloaded from \nderivative algorithm offered a major advantage in that it was impervious\nto low levels of motion artifacts compared with APD70 or APD90.15 All\nparameters, APDs, DOR, activation intervals, and heart rate were\nexpressed as the mean\u0003SEM. Comparisons were made using Student\u2019s\nt test on paired samples.14,29,32 Comparisons were made between paired\nsamples and t test was used to test the significance. A probability value\nof \u00070.05 was considered statistically significant. The isochronal lines\n(2-ms interval) were drawn using custom written software using IDL\n(Interactive Data Language).\nResults\nEffects of Autonomic Nerve Stimulation and\nPerfusion With Neurotransmitters on Heart Rate\nFigure 2 illustrates the time course of heart rate changes\nelicited by SNS (A), bilateral VNS (B), or perfusion with\nisoproterenol (C) or acetylcholine (D). All four interventions\nwere applied until the maximum change in heart rate was\nreached then the intervention was stopped. As shown in\nFigure 2A and 2B, the interruption of autonomic nerve\nstimulation resulted in the recovery of the heart rate back to\nits original value in seconds. In contrast, the wash of\nneurotransmitters and the reversal of their effects on heart rate\nwas considerably slower requiring several minutes. (Note\ntime scale in Figure 2C and 2D.) Bipolar electrogram record-\nings were made continuously to verify that the hearts remained\nin sinus rhythm throughout the measurements.

Figure 3A illustrates a map of repolarization\ngradient and a series of 16 superimposed APs from apex to\nbase at slow and fast sweep speeds, during sinus rhythm\nbefore SNS. Figure 3B shows the same measurement from\nthe same heart after 50 seconds of SNS at 15 Hz. The reversal\nof the direction of repolarization during SNS was attributable\nto difference of its effects at the base and apex of the\nventricles. As shown in the Table, SNS did not significantly\nchange APDs at the apex (control: APD\u0002159\u00034.2 ms;\nduring SNS: APD\u0002155\u000312 ms; P\u0002NS), whereas SNS\ncaused a marked shortening of APDs at the base (134\u00039.3\nms) compared with sinus rhythm (APD: 176\u00034.0 ms;\nP\u00070.001; n\u00027). DOR during sinus rhythm (APD base\u2013APD\napex) was 17\u00030.7 ms, and during SNS, DOR changed to\n\u000422\u00031.6 ms (P\u00070.001; n\u00027), meaning that the direction of\nrepolarization was reversed because of heterogeneities of the\neffects of SNS being more pronounced at the base than at the\napex.\nSinus Rhythm Versus Isoproterenol Infusion\nIsoproterenol infusion (100 nmol\/L) increased heart rate to\n204\u000313.1 bpm (n\u00026) (P\u00020.0289) and DOR to 23\u00031.6 ms\n(P\u00070.01, n\u00025) (Figure 2C) but did not change the direction\nSNS\n0 50 100 150 200\n200\n300\n400\n500\nA\nI(\nm\ns)\nTime (s )\n0. 0 0 .2 0. 4 0 .6 0. 8 1 .0\nTime (s)\nISO\n0 500 1000 1500\n200\n300\n400\n500\nA\nI\n(m\ns)\nTime (s )\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\nTime (s)\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\nTime (s)\n1V\nACH\n0 300 600 900\n200\n400\n600\n800\nTime (s)\nA\nI(\nm\ns)\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\nTime (s)\nVNS\n0 20 40\n400\n500\n600\nTime (s)\nA\nI\n(m\ns)\na\nb\nc\na\nb\nc\na\nb\nc\na\nb\nc\na\nb\nc\nA B C D\nFigure 2.

Figure 5 depicts the changes in DOR as\na function of time for 4 hearts for which DOR was mapped\nbefore, during 50 seconds of SNS, and 150 seconds after the\ninterruption of SNS. The slower recovery of DOR of \b2\nminutes implicates a cellular signaling process, but the\npossibility of a slow redistribution of neurotransmitter (ie,\nnorepinephrine) or a slow dissociation constant from its\nreceptor cannot be excluded.\nVagus Nerve Stimulation\nRight VNS caused a gradual drop in heart rate to 95\u00034.5 bpm\n(n\u00026), and DOR did not change significantly in magnitude or\ndirection (Table). Left VNS caused a significant a similar\ndrop in heart rate as for right VNS (96\u00035.8 bpm), failed to\nproduce a statistically significant change DOR, and did not\nreverse the orientation of repolarization (Table). In contrast,\nbilateral VNS reversed the direction of repolarization from\napex3base to base3apex, with \u0001APD\u0002\u000416\u00032 ms during\nbilateral VNS. Figure 3A and 3C through 3E compares maps\nof repolarization from the same during sinus rhythm (Figure\n3A, control), right VNS (Figure 3C), left VNS (Figure 3D),\nand bilateral VNS (Figure 3E). Bilateral VNS reversed the\nrepolarization sequence attributable to its different effects at\nthe base and apex of the ventricles. APDs at the apex\nincreased significantly during bilateral VNS compared with\nsinus rhythm, from 159\u00034.2 to 195\u000314 ms (n\u00026; p \u0007\u00020.02),\nwhich may be attributed in large part to the decrease in heart\nrate from 143\u00036.3 to 91\u00036.6 bpm (Table). At the base,\nhowever, bilateral VNS did not cause a statistically signifi-\ncant APD prolongation from 176\u00034.0 ms in sinus rhythm to\n178\u000313.8 ms with bilateral VNS (Table). When compared\nwith the anticipated APD prolongation observed by pacing at\nlong cycle lengths, bilateral VNS failed to produce the APD\nprolongation expected from the slower heart rate.\nSinus Rhythm Versus Acetylcholine Infusion\nPerfusion with acetylcholine (1 \u0001mol\/L) to mimic parasym-\npathetic nerve activity decreased heart rate to 105\u000310.2 bpm\nwith significant increase in (DOR 32\u00033.0 ms) but without\nany change in the direction of repolarization sequence (Ta-\nble).

As shown in Figure\n4C, repolarization advanced from apex to base, similar to\nrepolarization sequence recorded in the absence of autonomic\nnerve activity.\nEffects of Autonomic Nerve Stimulation on the\nRepolarization Sequence\nFigure 6 summarizes the changes in DOR measured on the\nleft ventricle of rabbit hearts during SNS, right, and left and\nbilateral VNS compared with isoproterenol or acetylcholine\nperfusion. The averaged data reveal a statistically significant\nreversal of the repolarization sequence, being oriented from\napex3base in controls to base3apex during SNS or bilateral\nVNS. Changes in the magnitude of DOR can be attributed to\nrate and cellular signaling effects caused by norepinephrine\nand acetylcholine, but the reversals of the repolarization\nsequence implicate spatial heterogeneities of autonomic\nnerves along the apex\u2013base axis.\nDiscussion\nThe main findings are that autonomic (bilateral either sym-\npathetic or parasympathetic) nerve stimulation changes DOR\non the epicardium in a manner distinct from perfusion with a\n\u0002-adrenergic or cholinergic agonist (see Figure 6). In partic-\nular, autonomic nerve stimulation was found to bring about a\nreversal of the direction of repolarization along the apex to\nbase axis of the heart. The reversal of DOR had a rapid onset\nof \u000715 seconds after SNS, and on stopping SNS, DOR\nreversed back to sinus rhythm DOR, with a latency of \b2\nminutes. Perfusion with isoproterenol produced similar in-\ncreases in heart rate as those obtained by SNS; yet there was\nno reversal of DOR. Similarly, bilateral VNS produced the\nexpected decrease in heart rate and reversed the direction\nof repolarization, whereas perfusion with acetylcholine\nproduced a similar decrease in heart rate but did not\nreverse DOR.\nIt is important to emphasize that the stimulation of the\nautonomic nerves described in this study followed previous\nprotocols that were shown to be physiological with respect to\n(1) changes in heart rate and (2) left ventricular developed\npressure.24 Changes in the latter parameters during SNS were\nentirely blocked by a selective \u00021 adrenergic antagonist\nmetoprolol (1.8 \u0001mol\/L) and during VNS by a muscarinic\nantagonist, atropine (0.1 \u0001mol\/L), indicating that autonomic\nnerve stimulation modulated the heart by the standard neu-\nrotransmitters.24 In the current experiments, autonomic nerve\nstimulation produced changes in heart rate in the physiolog-\nical range that were highly reproducible from heart to heart\nA CTRL\nB ISO\nC ACH\nBASE\nBASE\nBASE\nAPEX\nAPEX\nAPEX\nF\/F\n8%\nFigure 4.

Changes in heart rate, tem-\nperature depth of anesthesia, sympathetic tone, and electro-\nlyte balance all influence the APD locally and, thus, ventric-\nular repolarization. APs can be recorded from the epicardial\nsurface with microelectrodes or suction electrodes but only\nfrom a limited number of sites, leaving surface electrograms\nas the most practical method to track activation and repolar-\nization sequences.33 However, unlike activation, there is no\nelectrogram deflection that accurately identifies the onset or\ntermination of repolarization. Nevertheless, local activation\nrecovery intervals (ARIs) measured with surface electrodes\n(ie, activation time point (minimum dV\/dt of the QRS\ncomplex) minus the recovery (maximum dV\/dt of the\nT-wave) time point) were used as a surrogate for APDs\nmeasured with an intracellular electrode. In early studies on\ndog hearts, ventricular repolarization determined from ARIs\nproduced opposite findings; with repolarization sequence\nproceeding from base to apex34 or apex to base.35 Although\nthere was a good correlation between ARIs and refractory\nperiods and APDs, most ARIs were shorter than refractory\nperiods36 and differed from APDs by as much as 24 ms.37\nAlternatively, repolarization sequences determined from the\nlocal refractory periods indicated that repolarization and APD\ngradients proceeds from base to apex (short-to-long APDs) in\nsitu in dog hearts.38,39 A more recent study on canine and\nhuman hearts reported the opposite result that APDs are\nshorter in ventricular myocytes from the apex than the base\ncaused by higher densities of K\u0005 currents involved in ven-\ntricular repolarization.11\nThe advent of voltage sensitive dyes and optical mapping\ntechniques has provided new tools to characterize ventricular\nrepolarization.40 In isolated perfused hearts, ventricular repo-\nlarization was found to proceed from apex to base in a wide\nrange of species: (1) mouse,12,41 (2) rat,42 (3) guinea pig,14 (4)\nrabbit,32 and perhaps (5) dog and human hearts. In all of these\nspecies, repolarization is driven by a different set of ion\nchannels; yet their spatial distribution preserves short to long\nAPDs in going from apex to base, so as to guide the sequence\nof repolarization and relaxation.\nAnatomical Distribution of Autonomic Nerves to\nthe Heart\nSympathetic outflow to the heart emerges from the thoracic\nintermediolateral horns of the spinal cord. Preganglionic\nneurons in the spinal cord project to the heart via axons to\npostganglionic neurons to innervate the heart via paraverte-\nbral ganglia and the various thoracic and cardiac ganglia.43,44\nStudies on dogs reported that different branches of the\nsympathetic nerves innervated distinct regions of the ventri-\ncles but there is a controversy regarding such specific\nanatomical nerve distribution. In our experiment, spinal canal\nstimulation at the level of T2 vertebrae allowed us to broadly\nactivate bilaterally the sympathetic nerves thus, circumvent-\ning potential controversies, inaccuracies, and animal-to-\nanimal variability of cardiac nerve distribution.45,46\nEffects and Mechanism of Sympathetic Activity\non DOR\nChanges in APD during SNS were heterogeneous and strik-\ning. During the SNS, DOR not only increased across the\nFigure 6. Summary of auto-\nnomic modulation of DOR.

Under control condi-\ntions, APDs were longer at the base than the apex, whereas\nduring SNS, APDs at the base were significantly shorter than\nat the apex. Changes of DOR on SNS occurred rapidly in 5 to\n15 seconds, and DOR reversed back to control orientation but\nwith a slower time course of 130 to 140 seconds. These\nfindings are consistent with current concepts in the literature.\nThe autonomic nerves and of delayed rectifying K\u0005 channels\ninvolved in the repolarization of the heart are heteroge-\nneously distributed along the apex to base axis of the heart. In\nhuman hearts, autonomic nerves (both sympathetic and para-\nsympathetic) are considerably more abundant at the base\nthan the apex of left ventricles.47 The delayed rectifying\nK\u0005 currents are nonuniform on the surface of the heart,\nwith the slow component, IKs, being more abundant at the\nbase and the fast component, IKr, being more abundant at the\napex of the rabbit left ventricle.32,48 Moreover, IKs tends to be\na weak current, difficult to measure until activated by a\n\u0002-adrenergic agonist such as isoproterenol, which decreases\nthe refractory period by a protein kinase A\u2013dependent phos-\nphorylation of IKs but has no effect on IKr.49,50 Therefore in the\nabsence of sympathetic activity, IKr dominates and repolar-\nization advances from apex to base. In contrast, during SNS,\nactivation of IKs by norepinephrine is more abundant at the\nbase, resulting in greater APD shortening at the base than at\nthe apex and a reversal of the repolarization sequence. The\npreferential shortening of APDs at the base under sympa-\nthetic influence occurred in \b15 seconds (ie, time to phos-\nphorylate IKs) and was reversible on interruption of SNS with\na latency of 180 seconds consistent with the time course of IKs\ndephosphorylation.49\nInterestingly, perfusion of the heart with isoproterenol had\na tendency to enhance DOR (Table) by shortening APDs\nslightly more at the apex than the base, but the direction of\nrepolarization was not reversed. These data highlight the\ncomplexity of the system because SNS releases norepineph-\nrine, a \u0002- and \u0003-adrenergic agonist that stimulates nearly all\nionic currents and their kinetics. In addition, SNS may\nactivate afferent as well efferent nerves and release other\nneurotransmitters such as neuropeptide Y, ATP, and sub-\nstance P. Nevertheless, the results from the isoproterenol\nperfusion allows us to reasonably conclude that regional\n(apex\u2013base) heterogeneities of sympathetic innervation (ef-\nferent and\/or afferent nerves) is the dominant factor respon-\nsible for the reversal of DOR during SNS rather than IKr, IKs,\nor \u00021 adrenergic receptor distribution across the ventricle.28\nEffects and Mechanism of Parasympathetic\nActivity on DOR\nRight or left VNS did not change the DOR significantly, but\nbilateral VNS reversed the direction of DOR, this time by\nprolonging APD more at the apex than the base. All 3\nmethods of VNS decreased heart rate to the same extent, so\nthat differences in APD caused by the 3 conditions cannot be\nattributed to heart rate alone (Table and Figure 5) but to\nenhanced recruitment of parasympathetic and acetylcholine\nrelease during bilateral VNS. Acetylcholine released by\nvagus nerves may shorten ventricular APDs by increasing the\nK\u0005 conductance via the muscarinic receptors in the ventri-\ncle.51 Immunohistochemistry47 of parasympathetic nerve dis-\ntribution to the ventricle suggests a greater density of nerves\nat the base than the apex, which may explain the lack of APD\nprolongation at the base, despite the slow heart rate during\nbilateral VNS. Thus, as for SNS, the effects of VNS on DOR\nare most likely caused by heterogeneities in nerve distribution\nresulting in the modulation of the repolarization sequence.\nNeuronal modulation of ventricular repolarization is unique\nand distinct from pharmacological modulation. These find-\nings reveal that under physiological conditions autonomic\nactivity has a marked impact on cardiac repolarization and\nbroaden our views on why and how \u201cautonomic imbalance\u201d\nmay be an important factor contributing to arrhythmia vul-\nnerability during physical or emotional stress. Further studies\nare needed to elucidate the effects of autonomic nerve activity\non transmural repolarization, on hearts with long QT or\nischemia to gain deeper insights into the contribution of\nneural activity to arrhythmia vulnerability.\nSources of Funding\nThis study was supported by NIH grants RO1 HL57929 and\nHL70722 (to G.S.).\nDisclosures\nNone.\nReferences\n1.
