Introduction\n[2] The Improved Limb Atmospheric Spectrometer\n(ILAS)-II is a satellite-borne sensor that measures ozone\nand its related chemical species in the high-latitude strato-\nsphere on the basis of the solar occultation technique\n[Sasano et al., 2001; Nakajima et al., 2006a]. ILAS-II is\nthe successor to ILAS, which was continuously operated\nfrom November 1996 through June 1997 [Sasano et al.,\n1995; Sasano, 2002, and references therein] and filled a gap\nbetween the Polar Ozone and Aerosol Measurement\n(POAM) II (October 1993 to November 1996) and POAM\nIII (April 1998 to present) measurements. It is important to\nobserve the vertical profile of ozone at high latitudes for\nseveral reasons: (1) to monitor ozone trends in the vertical\ndistribution [e.g., Randel and Wu, 1999; Staehelin et al.,\n2001]; (2) to evaluate the amount and\/or rate of chemical\nozone destruction in the polar vortex [e.g., Bevilacqua et al.,\n1997; Terao et al., 2002; Hoppel et al., 2003; Tilmes et al.,\n2003; Singleton et al., 2005]; (3) to understand the impact\nof polar-processed air on midlatitude ozone [e.g., Ajtic\u00b4 et\nal., 2004]; (4) to improve data assimilation of global three-\ndimensional ozone distribution [Stajner and Wargan, 2004];\n(5) to improve the quality of ozone climatology data, hence,\na priori information for data retrieval of nadir-viewing\nsensors [Lamsal et al., 2004]; and (6) to predict the Arctic\ntotal ozone in the spring time using vertical profiles of\nozone in the preceding Arctic fall [Kawa et al., 2005].\n[3] ILAS-II was launched onboard the Advanced Earth\nObserving Satellite (ADEOS)-II on 14 December 2002. It\nwas preoperational between January and early April 2003,\nand then operational until the time ADEOS-II ceased\noperation on 24 October 2003 owing to a failure of the\npower supply of the satellite. During these periods, ILAS-II\nobtained 5890 observations, ranging in latitude from 54\u0001N\nto 71\u0001N and from 64\u0001S to 88\u0001S, depending on the season.\nThere are approximately 14 measurements a day for each of\nthe hemispheres, at sunrise seen from the satellite in the\nNorthern Hemisphere (NH) and at sunset seen from the\nsatellite in the Southern Hemisphere (SH). Local times at\nthe Earth\u2019s surface are always p.m. in the NH, but in the SH\nthey are a.m. between the end of March and the end of\nSeptember, and p.m. at other times. Ranges of the measure-\nment altitude (in the data files) of ozone are from 70 km to\n\u000110 km. The lower limit varies from event to event, ranging\ndown to 7 km, with a limiting factor of the sun tracking\nsystem (T. Tanaka et al., unpublished manuscript, 2006).\n[4] In this paper, we focus on assessing the ILAS-II data\nquality of vertical profiles of ozone concentrations which\nwere processed with the version 1.4 retrieval algorithm (the\nfirst public release). During the observation period, the four\nsatellite solar occultation sensors, namely, the Stratospheric\nAerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) II, SAGE III, the\nHalogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE), and POAM III,\nwere operational, so we used these data for comparisons.\nWe used data from ozonesondes, which are valuable data\nfor validation of ozone vertical profiles as an in situ\nmeasurement, although the comparisons are generally lim-\nited to the altitude range below 30\u201335 km. The ILAS-II\ncomparison procedure is similar to that applied to ILAS, as\ndescribed by Sugita et al. [2002].\n2. ILAS-II: Instrumentation and Retrieval\nAlgorithm\n[5] ILAS-II mainly consists of the infrared channel (6.2\u2013\n11.8 mm with 44 spectral elements) and the visible channel\n(753\u2013784 nm with 1024 spectral elements), which were\nalso used on ILAS. Two infrared channels (the midinfrared\nchannel (3.0\u20135.7 mm with 22 spectral elements) and the\nother infrared channel (around 12.8 mm with 22 spectral\nelements)) are added in ILAS-II [Nakajima et al., 2006a].\nAn improved version of the sun-edge sensor (SES) from\nthat used in ILAS was also installed (T. Tanaka et al.,\nunpublished manuscript, 2006). The u3 band centered near\n9.6 mm in the infrared channel is used for detecting ozone.\nThe data sampling rate of 10 Hz (i.e., data points with\nancillary measurements every 0.1 s) is used for all channels\nand the SES. The instantaneous field of view at the tangent\nheight (TH) has a 1 km height in the vertical direction and a\n13 km width in the horizontal direction for the infrared\nchannel. The partial slant path along the line of sight within\na 1 km thick layer just above the TH of 20 km is less than\n230 km. Applying a data smoothing digital filter for 21\nconsecutive data points, the vertical resolutions are estimated\nto be 1.3 km at a TH of 15 km and 2.9 km at a TH of 50 km,\ndepending on atmospheric refraction (T. Yokota et al., un-\npublished manuscript, 2006).\n[6] Vertical profiling of trace gases for ILAS-II adopts a\nmethod similar to that for ILAS as described by Yokota et\nal. [2002]. First, the retrieval algorithm is based on an\n\u2018\u2018onion-peeling\u2019\u2019 method that uses a nonlinear least squares\nfitting for observed and theoretically calculated transmit-\ntance spectra (spectral fitting) from an altitude of 70 km to\n10 km every 1 km downward to determine the volume\nmixing ratios (VMRs) of ten different trace gases (O3,\nHNO3, NO2, N2O, CH4, H2O, CFC-11, CFC-12, ClONO2,\nand N2O5). The corresponding retrieval parameters are set\nto \u2018\u2018unknown\u2019\u2019 parameters (target gases). The observed\ntransmittance is derived from solar spectrum measurements\n(for 100% solar radiation calibration), deep space measure-\nments (for 0% emission calibration), and each of the\nsampling data points through the atmosphere. The theoret-\nically calculated transmittance is derived by determining a\npath length in the atmosphere for each of the data points\nD11S02 SUGITA ET AL.: OZONE PROFILES MEASURED BY ILAS-II\n2 of 15\nD11S02\nusing a set of VMRs of target gases (as the initial guess, it is\nthe same as the reference atmosphere model in section 3),\nabsorption line parameters of these molecules, solar irradi-\nance data, temperature and pressure profiles, and instrument\nfunctions of the infrared channel. In the version 1.4 retrieval\nalgorithm, the High-resolution Transmission (HITRAN)\n2000 edition including updates through 2001 [Rothman et\nal., 2003] is used for the line parameters for gases. Pseudo\nline parameters provided by G. C. Toon (unpublished data,\n1995, 2000) are used for ClONO2, N2O5, CFC-11, and\nCFC-12. The CKD version 2.4 in the Line-By-Line Radi-\native Transfer Model (LBLRTM) [Clough et al., 1989] is\nused for calculating the continuum absorption for H2O.\nTemperature and pressure profiles required for the retrieval\nare taken from the United Kingdom Meteorological Office\n(Met Office, abbreviated here as MetO) stratospheric anal-\nyses data [Swinbank and O\u2019Neill, 1994] implemented by the\n3-D variational data assimilation scheme [Lorenc et al.,\n2000] from 1000 hPa to 0.316 hPa and the COSPAR\nInternational Reference Atmosphere (CIRA) 1986 data\n[Fleming et al., 1988] for the altitudes above the MetO\ndata, and they are interpolated in time and space for each of\nthe ILAS-II measurements for the retrieval. The version 1.4\nalgorithm is described in detail by T. Yokota et al. (unpub-\nlished manuscript, 2006).\n3. ILAS-II: Error Analysis\n[7] To evaluate the quality (in terms of precision) of the\nILAS-II ozone retrieval itself is of importance, because if\nvalidation with other data shows a difference, we can judge\nwhether the difference is really a bias or not. In the version\n5.2 data of ILAS, two components of error are evaluated\nand then the total error is calculated by the root sum square\n(RSS) of each error [Yokota et al., 2002]. One is an\n\u2018\u2018internal error\u2019\u2019 which is determined by residuals in the\nspectral fitting procedure. The other is an \u2018\u2018external error\u2019\u2019\nwhich is determined by some sensitivity tests assuming\nuncertainties in data used for computing the calculated\ntransmittance. It has been pointed out that the internal\nerrors, which have been released as the ILAS data products,\nmay involve systematic errors inherent in the calculated\nand\/or observed spectra [Yokota et al., 2002; Toon et al.,\n2002], resulting in increased internal error values, particu-\nlarly for minor gases: CFC-12 [Khosrawi et al., 2004] and\nClONO2 [Nakajima et al., 2006b]. Basically, internal errors\nare estimated on the basis of the assumption that spectral\nresiduals are not systematic, and are due to random errors.\nRecently, however, an in-depth study on the spectral resid-\nuals has revealed that systematic spectral residuals of non-\nnegligible magnitude exist in the ILAS as well as in the\nILAS-II measurement events in common (T. Yokota et al.,\nunpublished manuscript, 2006). Therefore the internal error\nestimated for ILAS and ILAS-II data are overestimated as\nthe random error, and should not be used for the index of\nrandom errors.\n[8] Accordingly, instead of the conventional internal error\ncalculations based on spectral residuals, \u2018\u2018repeatability error\u2019\u2019\n(see below) was employed as a measure of the random errors\n(or measurement precision) for processing the ILAS-II\nversion 1.4 data products. Subsequently, external errors\nwere calculated on the basis both of uncertainty in the\nassumed temperature, which had also been taken into\nconsideration for the ILAS data retrievals, and uncertainty\nin the assumed climatological values of gas species,\nwhich is used for the nongaseous contribution correction\nmethod (see also below).\n[9] A method for calculating the repeatability error, i.e.,\nhow to seek the \u2018\u2018repeatability condition,\u2019\u2019 is based on the\nminimum variability in VMRs found from the whole\nmeasurement period, instead of giving quiescent periods\nin advance as was done by Yokota et al. [2002] and\nKhosrawi et al. [2004]. In order to search for the most\nquiescent period, relative standard deviation (RSD) as one\nsigma standard deviation (around the mean) divided by the\nmean value was calculated for 100 consecutive occultation\nevents (corresponding to about a 7.5 day period bin) at\nevery 50 occultation events (corresponding to a time sepa-\nration of about 3.5 days) repeatedly from April through\nOctober 2003 for both hemispheres. Profiles of the lowest\nRSDs in percent, which are considered to correspond to the\nmost quiescent periods, are shown in Figure 1. Period bins\nthat were selected at every altitude separately for both\nhemispheres are also shown in Table 1. Generally, the\nlowest RSD value is seen from the boreal summer and\nfrom the austral spring. This quantity represents an upper\nlimit to the measurement precision, because it may also\ninclude real geophysical variability. In practice, the retrieval\nvalue (ppmv) multiplied by the fractional value of the\nlowest RSD is set to the repeatability error (ppmv) for all\nof the events separately for hemispheres in the ILAS-II\nversion 1.4 data files. The derivation of the repeatability\nerror is described in detail by T. Yokota et al. (unpublished\nmanuscript, 2006). Finally, the total error was calculated\nfrom the RSS of the repeatability error and the external\nerror, which was then incorporated in the ILAS-II version\n1.4 data products. Note, however, that the total error\nFigure 1. Profiles of the relative standard deviation for\n100 consecutive occultation events in the most quiescent\nperiod during the ILAS-II measurements (see text,\nsection 3).\nD11S02 SUGITA ET AL.: OZONE PROFILES MEASURED BY ILAS-II\n3 of 15\nD11S02\nevaluated in this manner does not reflect the magnitude of\nspectral residuals in the spectral fitting.\n[10] Two points should be noted in terms of uncertainties\nin the retrieved profiles, as discussed for the ILAS version\n5.2 algorithm [Yokota et al., 2002]. First, accuracy of the\nTH is crucial, because any TH ambiguity propagates directly\nto uncertainty in retrieved VMR profiles. For the ILAS-II\nversion 1.4 algorithm, the TH was determined using the\nmethod discussed by T. Tanaka et al. (unpublished manu-\nscript, 2006). The estimated accuracy in the determined TH is\n180m \u00b1 30m. Such an error will affect ozoneVMRs by 2% at\nan altitude of 20 km and 5% at an altitude of 50 km (T. Tanaka\net al., unpublished manuscript, 2006).\n[11] The second point is the systematic errors associated\nwith the nongaseous contribution correction by the simple\nlinear interpolation between the window spectral elements\n[Yokota et al., 2002]. This method is still required in the\nILAS-II version 1.4 algorithm in order to derive vertical\nprofiles of the gaseous concentration in the altitude range\nwhere extinction due to aerosol particles (sulfate aerosols\nand\/or polar stratospheric clouds, PSCs) cannot be neglected\n(T. Yokota et al., unpublished manuscript, 2006). To deter-\nmine the nongaseous component in the theoretical calculation\nof the total (gaseous + nongaseous) transmittance, we calcu-\nlate the nongaseous extinction coefficients at the four spectral\nelements where the absorption due to gaseous species is\nrelatively small (so-called \u2018\u2018window spectral element\u2019\u2019). To\ndo this, we used climatological values of gas VMR profiles\n(reference atmosphere model) as shown by T. Yokota et al.\n(unpublished manuscript, 2006) for calculating the gaseous\ncontribution at the four spectral elements. The difference\nbetween the calculated (gaseous) and observed (gaseous +\nnongaseous) transmittances at the four spectral elements thus\ngives the nongaseous extinction coefficients by using the path\nlength information. Finally, the nongaseous extinction coef-\nficients at all the other 40 spectral elements can be derived by\nlinear interpolation between these four window spectral\nelements, resulting in the nongaseous transmittance. Use\nof data from this reference atmosphere model would\nintroduce some errors in the calculated transmittance at\nthe four spectral elements; these are considered as the\nexternal error (as mentioned earlier). The interpolation\nwould also produce systematic errors for the retrieved\nprofiles of the gaseous concentration, but we do not\ninclude these in the external error. To evaluate them,\nwe simulated transmittances for cases with several types\nof infrared absorption spectra for sulfate aerosols (50 and\n75 wt% H2SO4\/H2O binary solutions) and PSCs (nitric\nacid trihydrate (NAT) particle, supercooled or liquid\nternary solutions (STS or LTS) for four different compo-\nsitions, and ice (ICE) particle) as nongaseous components\nand with the above mentioned reference profiles (a priori\nprofiles) as gaseous components. Using these simulated\ntransmittances, retrievals of the vertical profile of the\ngaseous concentration were made by applying the linear\ninterpolation method for the nongaseous contribution in\nthe version 1.4 retrieval algorithm discussed here. The\ndifference between each set of the a priori and the\nretrieved gas profiles results in the systematic error. For\nconvenience, the error is expressed in number density as\na function of the aerosol extinction coefficient (AEC) at\n780 nm data (which can be derived from the visible\nchannel), and the result is shown by T. Yokota et al.\n(unpublished manuscript, 2006). Here, the systematic\nerrors in terms of ozone VMR are listed in Table 2 for\nTable 1.

Brief Description for Validation Data\n4.1. SAGE II, SAGE III, HALOE, and POAM III\n[12] In this analysis, we used ozone data from the SAGE\nII version 6.2 data, the SAGE III version 3 data, the\nHALOE version 19 data, and the POAM III version 4 data.\nAll of the data are publicly available for scientific use\nthrough their World Wide Web servers (see Acknowledg-\nments). The accuracy of the SAGE II version 6.2 ozone data\nis comparable to that of the version 6.1 ozone data where\nWang et al. [2002] made comprehensive validation analy-\nses. It reveals approximately 5% accuracy at altitudes\nbetween 15 and 45 km. Taha et al. [2004] confirmed that\nthe SAGE III version 3 ozone data agree well with the\nSAGE II version 6.2 data within \u00b15% between 15 and\n55 km. In this analysis, we used the RSS of this level of\naccuracy (5%) and random error values described in each\nSAGE II or III data file. For the HALOE version 19 ozone\ndata, we used the RSS total error values that were estimated\naccording to the procedure described by Sugita et al.\n[2002], on the basis of the HALOE error estimation from\nBru\u00a8hl et al. [1996]. The POAM III version 3 ozone data\nreveals approximately 5% accuracy in altitudes between 13\nand 60 km [Randall et al., 2003]. For the POAM III version\n4 ozone data, the difference from version 3 ozone data was\nevaluated to be less than 5% above 20 km in altitude. We\nused the RSS of this level of accuracy (5%) and random\nerror values described in each POAM III data file.\n4.2. Ozonesonde\n[13] Table 3 shows a list of the number of ozonesonde\nprofiles and the principal investigators (PI) for each of the\nstations used here (see also section 5.1 for coincidence\ncriteria). We used ozonesonde data from three nonpublic\ndatabases: one is the correlative measurement database\n(CMDB) of ILAS-II (http:\/\/www-ilas2.nies.go.jp\/). The\nILAS-II core validation was conducted at Kiruna, Sweden,\nand Syowa Station, Antarctica (PI: H. Kanzawa). The data\nfrom Fairbanks, Alaska (PI: Y. Murayama), have been taken\nas the Alaska Project led by the National Institute of\nInformation and Communications Technology (NICT),\nJapan. The second is a database of the project Quantita-\ntive Understanding of Ozone losses by Bipolar Investi-\ngations (QUOBI) (http:\/\/www.nilu.no\/quobi\/). The third is\nthe Envisat validation database (http:\/\/nadir.nilu.no\/calval\/).\nThe Norwegian Institute for Air Research (NILU) maintains\nand manages the second and third databases. There are no\ndifferences in the ozone data between theQUOBI andEnvisat\ndatabases for the same stations. Data from observations made\nat Neumayer (PI: G. Ko\u00a8nig-Langlo\/H. Gernandt) and Syowa\nStation (PI: K. Sato) in the Antarctic and Salekhard and\nYakutsk in Russia (PI: V. Dorokhov\/V. A. Yushkov) have\nbeen registered both in the QUOBI and CMDB databases.\nData from observations made at Kiruna, Sweden, have\nbeen registered both in the CMDB and Envisat databases.\nThe Electrochemical Concentration Cell (ECC) type ozo-\nnesondes [Komhyr, 1969] were used for all of the\nstations, except for Syowa Station (PI: H. Kanzawa)\nwhere observations were made using the RS II-KC-96\n(KC) type sonde [World Meteorological Organization\n(WMO), 1998, section 1.8] in addition to ECC type\nsondes (PI: K. Sato). The estimated precision and accu-\nracy in the ECC ozonesonde measurements are \u00b13% and\n\u00b15%, respectively, in the stratosphere up to 10 hPa\n[Komhyr et al., 1995].

In this\nanalysis, we used an accuracy of 5% for altitudes below\n30 km.\n5. Comparative Conditions\n5.1. Temporal and Spatial Criteria\n[14] A conventional approach to making comparisons is\nused for this study, by seeking coincidence measurement\npairs that fulfill certain criteria of temporal and spatial\ndifferences between the two. In order to compare ozone\nvalues in the upper stratosphere and lower mesosphere, a\ncoincidence time criterion for satellite comparisons of 1 hour\nis used, since the diurnal variation of ozone in those\naltitude regions becomes significant above 50 km [e.g.,\nBrasseur and Solomon, 1984]. We set the coincidence\ncriteria basically to 300 km in distance. However, for\ncomparisons with HALOE, 500 km is used for the\ndistance criterion in order to increase the number of\ncoincidence pairs. A list of the extracted pairs and the\nstatistics is shown in Table 4. For comparisons with\nozonesondes, we set the coincidence criteria to 500 km\nin distance and \u00b112 hours in time difference (same as\nSugita et al. [2002]). A list of the stations and the number\nof profiles is already shown in Table 3, and the statistics is\nalso shown in Table 4. In total, 176 ozonesonde profiles\nwere extracted. As the representative location and time of\nthe measurements, those at the measurement (or tangent)\npoint of 20 km altitude were used. Movement of the\nballoon is considered for ozonesonde measurements using\ntheir wind data, if available, otherwise using the MetO\nwind data. Figures 2a and 2b show measurement latitudes\nat 20 km altitude of satellite sensors (order and color are\ncorresponding to those for Figure 9) and ozonesondes used\nin this study, respectively.\n5.2. Consistency of Altitude to Be Compared and\nData Filtering\n[15] In order to compare profiles between ILAS-II and\nvalidation data at every 1 km in geometric altitude, the\nvertical grids should be consistent with each other. Ozone\ndata in a dimension of VMR or number density are provided\nin the vertical grid of 0.5 km for SAGE II and III, about 0.3 km\nfor HALOE, 1 km for POAM III, and about 0.1 km for\nozonesonde. The POAM III data are not necessary to be\nconverted, but other data are converted into the 1 km grid by\nthe method used by Sugita et al. [2002]. For the SAGE II and\nIII data, ozone number densities were averaged at every 1 km\nusing consecutive three data points centered at i km (i:\ninteger), and then the VMR was calculated.\n[16] To ensure consistency of the observed air masses, the\ndata selection employed the method of Sugita et al. [2002]\nusing the Ertel\u2019s potential vorticity (PV). PV values at every\n1 km below 50 km in altitude were calculated by using the\nMetO data at each measurement location and time at 20 km\naltitude. We calculated relative differences in percent de-\nfined as:\n100\u0004 2\u0004 PV ILAS-II\u00f0 \u00de \u0003 PV val\u00f0 \u00def g= PV ILAS-II\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe PV val\u00f0 \u00def g\n\u00f01\u00de\nfor each 1 km altitude grid point where PV(ILAS-II) and\nPV(val) denote PV values at the ILAS-II and validation\nmeasurement locations and times, respectively. The\nestimated uncertainty in the calculated PV values from\nthe MetO data is roughly 3% on the basis of an\nexamination of sensitivity. The PV difference by different\nvertical interpolations between linear and cubic-spline\n(cubic-spline is used here) in the potential temperature\n(PT) coordinate is about 2\u20133%. Differences of the PT at\nthe same altitude are mostly less than 0.5%, correspond-\nTable 4.

If the\ndifference exceeded \u00b115%, the data at these altitudes\nwere discarded from this validation analysis. As a result,\n318 (0.5% of the total number of altitudes below 50 km),\n81 (1.0%), 113 (9.4%), and 230 (4.8%) number of\naltitudes are screened for comparisons with POAM III,\nSAGE III, HALOE, and ozonesondes, respectively, from\nthis validation analysis.\n[17] In this paper, we show the ILAS-II ozone data\nquality only using reliable retrievals, because we do not\nrecommend data users to use possible suspicious data. We\nperformed the data filtering as follows. If the ozone value\nwas less than the absolute value of its measurement\nuncertainty (as described in sections 3 and 4), the\nreliability of that ozone value was considered to be too\nlow, and it was also filtered out. Moreover, as we\ndiscussed in section 3, the ILAS-II version 1.4 data might\nhave been biased owing to the existence of aerosol\/PSC.\nThe possible biased ILAS-II ozone data were screened\nout as follows. As mentioned in section 3, the systematic\nerror values can be estimated from the AEC at 780 nm\ndata (T. Yokota et al., unpublished manuscript, 2006).\nThe ILAS-II version 1.4 AEC at 780 nm data are\nvalidated elsewhere [Saitoh et al., 2006]. The estimated\nsystematic error for the ICE case, as an upper limit, at\nevery altitude below 30 km is compared to the value\nequivalent to 15% of the retrieved value. If the former\n(systematic error) exceeded the latter, the data at these\naltitudes were discarded from this validation analysis.\nThis is only effective for comparisons with POAM III\nand ozonesonde in the SH winter, since the AEC at 780 nm\nvalues are high owing to the presence of PSCs in those\nperiods. Moreover, the lowermost stratospheric ozone data\nare also screened, yielding fewer coincidence pairs below\n11 km especially in the NH. In addition, three profiles in\nthe validation data (one from ozonesonde at South Pole\nStation, the others from HALOE and SAGE III) were\ndiscarded from this analysis, because they revealed appar-\nently abnormal (or jagged) features.\n6. Results and Discussion\n6.1. Satellite Sensors\n[18] In this subsection, we present the results of compar-\nisons according to the number of correlative profiles,\nnamely, POAM III, SAGE III, SAGE II, and then HALOE.\nAlthough the comparisons were made in both ozone number\ndensity and VMR, there is little difference in the results\nbetween the two approaches except for a comparison with\nHALOE shown in section 6.1.4. Therefore, to maintain\nconsistency with Sugita et al. [2002] and the release format\nof the ILAS-II data (VMR), the comparison results are\npresented in VMR.\n6.1.1.

In the right and middle plots, the median of\nindividual absolute differences, AD, and relative differ-\nences, RD, between ILAS-II and POAM III are shown,\nrespectively, together with several statistics.

The mean RSS error in the NH is within\n\u00b110% above 20 km in altitude, and increases to 30%\nbelow 20 km, whereas in the SH, the mean RSS error is\nseveral to 10% larger than that in the NH.\n[20] In the NH comparison (Figure 3a), the median value\nof RD over N (middle plot) is within \u00b110% below 45 km,\nrevealing a fairly good agreement, but decreases to near\n\u000330% with increasing altitudes above 45 km. The root mean\nsquare (r.m.s.) difference over N is roughly proportional to\nthe absolute value of the median value, reaching 30% at the\nworst. Generally, the r.m.s. value is proportional to the\nabsolute value of the median value for all of the comparisons\nin this paper as shown below. The median value of AD over\nN (right plot) is of the order of\u00030.4\/\u00030.5 ppmv above 25 km.\nBelow 25 km, the median value is near zero because of small\nretrieved values (left plot). In the SH comparison (Figure 3b),\nthemedian value of RD is roughly\u000310% for all altitudes. The\nmedian value of AD ranges from zero to \u00030.2 ppmv,\nreaching \u00030.4 ppmv at the worst (at 43 km).\n[21] In comparisons with POAM III, we have a large\nnumber of pairs in each month in both of the hemispheres\n(see Figure 2a), and comparisons were made every month\nseparately for the hemispheres. Although not shown in the\nfigure, comparisons reveal that there is no significant sea-\nsonal dependence in the RD values for all altitude ranges.\n6.1.2. SAGE III\n[22] Figure 4 shows average profiles of ozone measured\nby ILAS-II and SAGE III in the NH. The SAGE III ozone\nvalues retrieved by the multiple linear regression (MLR)\nmethod and the least squares (LS) method (so-called\n\u2018\u2018SAGE II like\u2019\u2019 retrieval) were compared with the ILAS-\nII ozone values. Here, we used the LS retrieval for the\nSAGE III data, because the MLR ozone values are signif-\nicantly higher than the LS ozone values up to 150% in the\naltitude range between 51 and 60 km. On the other hand, the\nMLR ozone values agree fairly well with the LS ozone\nvalues between 11 and 50 km (on average, the MLR ozone\nis 0.3% smaller than the LS ozone). The mean RSS error is\nwithin \u00b110% at altitudes between 20 and 40 km, but below\nand above the altitude range, it increases with increasing\/\ndecreasing altitude, reaching 20% at 11 km and 40% at 48 km.\nThe median value of RD ranges from \u000310% to \u000320%\nbetween 23 and 47 km. Below 22 km, it ranges from \u000310%\nto +5%. The median value of AD ranges from \u00030.5 to\n\u00030.8 ppmv above 25 km, and it becomes near zero\nbelow 25 km. The RSS error increases significantly\nabove 45 km, thus the significant negative deviations of the\nRD values up to \u000350% above 45 km are not conclusive.\n[23] In Figure 5, retrievals from the mesospheric mode\nusing the Hartley-Huggins band channel (284\u2013296 nm) in\nthe SAGE III data are compared to the ILAS-II data. In this\ncomparison, information for the extracted measurement\npairs differs somewhat from the comparison of the LS\nretrieval, since the representative location at an altitude of\n50 km is used instead of that at 20 km (219 pairs in total\nwere extracted). In Figure 5, we show the comparison above\n50 km, below which the signal in the SAGE III Hartley-\nHuggins band channel is saturated. The median profile of\nRD reveals \u000330% above 55 km, exceeding the RSS error\nrange of \u00b110\u201320%. The median profile of AD ranges from\nzero to \u00030.4 ppmv.\n6.1.3. SAGE II\n[24] Figure 6 shows average profiles of ozone measured\nby ILAS-II and SAGE II in the NH. The median profile of\nRD tends to decrease with increasing altitude, reaching\n\u000350% at altitudes above 65 km. The median value of AD\nFigure 4. Same as Figure 3a but for ILAS-II and SAGE III (LS retrieval, \u2018\u2018SAGE II like\u2019\u2019) in the\nNorthern Hemisphere.\nD11S02 SUGITA ET AL.: OZONE PROFILES MEASURED BY ILAS-II\n9 of 15\nD11S02\nis, on average, \u00030.4 to \u00030.5 ppmv above 25 km. It should\nbe noted that the negative biases found above 50 km are\nroughly 10% larger than those found from other compar-\nisons (ILAS-II and POAM III, SAGE III (mesospheric\nmode), or HALOE (see section 6.1.4)).\n6.1.4. HALOE\n[25] Figure 7a shows average profiles of ozone VMR\nmeasured by ILAS-II and HALOE in the NH. The median\nvalue of RD is within \u00b110% below 47 km, although it tends\nto decrease (the difference becomes large) with increasing\naltitude. Such a tendency is remarkable above 48 km,\nreaching \u000340% at 68 km. The median value of AD is, on\naverage, \u00030.6 ppmv at around 35\u201340 km, but it ranges\nfrom \u00030.4 to +0.1 ppmv for other altitudes. Figure 7b\nshows comparisons in ozone number density. It is interest-\ning to note that the median value of RD in the number\ndensity comparison is from several to 10% (at maximum)\nlower than that in the VMR comparison above 30 km in\naltitude. This fact suggests that temperature and pressure\ndata (and thus air number density) used for each of the\nFigure 5. Same as Figure 3a but for ILAS-II and SAGE III (mesospheric mode) in the Northern\nHemisphere. The altitude range is from 40 to 70 km.\nFigure 6. Same as Figure 3a but for ILAS-II and SAGE II in the Northern Hemisphere.\nD11S02 SUGITA ET AL.: OZONE PROFILES MEASURED BY ILAS-II\n10 of 15\nD11S02\nretrieval algorithms are different at the same geometric\naltitude (ILAS-II uses the MetO and CIRA data, and\nHALOE uses its own retrievals). The differences in the\ntemperature and pressure data may partly be due to the\nlatitudinal difference of the measurements (see Figure 2a).\n[26] Only one coincidence pair in the SH was found in\nJanuary 2003 during the preoperational period of ILAS-II.\nAlthough not shown in figures such as Figure 7, there is no\nsignificant RD value of \u000330% at higher altitudes as was\nfound in the NH comparisons. The result of the SH\ncomparison will be illustrated in a summary figure\n(Figure 9) as a reference (see section 6.3).\n6.2. Ozonesonde\n[27] Similar to the satellite comparisons, comparisons\nwith ozonesondes in VMR are described here. Note that\nthe difference between the comparison result in VMR and\nthat in number density was at most a few percent. Average\nprofiles of ozone measured by ILAS-II and ozonesondes in\nthe NH below 30 km are shown in Figure 8a. Figure 8b\nshows average profiles of ozone measured by ILAS-II and\nozonesondes in the SH. In total, 51 and 236 measurement\npairs were used for the NH and SH comparisons from 51\nand 124 vertical profiles of ozonesondes, respectively. Note\nthat 93 coincidence pairs are used in this comparison from\nseven ozonesonde profiles at South Pole Station between\n21 and 28 km (about 14 ILAS-II observations fulfill the\ncoincidence criteria against only one ozonesonde observa-\ntion). The inclusion of ozonesondes in the polar regions\nwas particularly important, especially in the SH, because of\nthe large chances of coincidence given by the ILAS-II\norbit.\na\nb\nFigure 7. (a) Same as Figure 3a but for ILAS-II and HALOE in the Northern Hemisphere. (b) Same as\nFigure 7a but in ozone number density.\nD11S02 SUGITA ET AL.: OZONE PROFILES MEASURED BY ILAS-II\n11 of 15\nD11S02\n[28] In the NH comparison, the median value of RD is\nwithin \u00b110%, but it can be seen that the RD values tend to\nbe negative above and positive below a crossing point of 20\nkm altitude. The median value of AD is within \u00b10.2 ppmv\nbelow 20 km, but reaches \u00030.6 ppmv above 25 km. This is\nin accordance with results from the NH comparisons with\nboth POAM III and SAGE II. Similar to the NH compar-\nison, the median value of RD is negative (\u00035\/\u000310%) above\n20 km and positive (+30% at maximum) below 20 km in the\nSH comparison. However, the median value of AD shows\nmuch smaller deviation in the SH than in the NH, reaching\n\u00030.3 ppmv at most.\n6.3. Summary for Each Data Source\n[29] Using the results shown in sections 6.1 and 6.2, a\nstatistical value, calculated by equation (5), is shown in\nFigure 9. The median value of RD was averaged over each\nof the 5 km altitude bins, weighted by N at each altitude, for\nevery validation source.\nD weighted mean\u00f0 \u00de %\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc S RDj\u0004 Nj\u00f0 \u00de=SNj j \u00bc 1 to 5\u00f0 \u00de \u00f05\u00de\nwhere j denotes each altitude within a 5 km altitude bin. For\nSAGE III, results from a comparison by the LS retrieval are\nshown below 60 km, and those by the mesospheric retrieval\nare shown above 51 km. For reference, \u00b110% guide lines\nare shown by dashed lines. In the NH comparisons (right\nplot), the D value is within +10% between 11 and 20 km,\nand within \u000310% between 21 and 40 km. We conclude that\nthe sunrise mode ILAS-II data at 11\u201340 km have good\naccuracy, even though only five pairs were used at an\naltitude of 11 km. Above 41 km, the D value tends to\na\nb\nFigure 8. (a) Same as Figure 3a but for ILAS-II and ozonesondes in theNorthernHemisphere. (b) Same as\nFigure 3a but for ILAS-II and ozonesondes in the Southern Hemisphere.\nD11S02 SUGITA ET AL.: OZONE PROFILES MEASURED BY ILAS-II\n12 of 15\nD11S02\ndecrease (smaller ILAS-II ozone values) with increasing\naltitude, although the magnitude of the D value is different\naccording to the data sources. As discussed in section 6.1.2,\nthe large negative deviations in the ILAS-II ozone data\nabove 46 km found from comparison with SAGE III LS\nretrievals are not conclusive. Therefore we also conclude\nthat the ILAS-II ozone data in the NH are 10\u201330% smaller\n(biased low) than others between 41 and 70 km, except for\ncomparison with SAGE II from which the negative biases in\nthe ILAS-II ozone data above 51 km are roughly 10% larger\nthan those found from other comparisons.\n[30] In the SH comparisons (left plot), it seems that there\nis no negative bias in the upper stratosphere\/lower meso-\nsphere as was found in the NH. Since only one profile was\nused for the SH comparison with HALOE, it is merely a\nreference for the SH statistical comparison. The result\ncannot be used to draw conclusions regarding the quality\nof ILAS-II ozone data. The D value is within \u00b110% for\naltitudes between 11 and 60 km, except for an 11\u201315 km\nbin (more than +10%), confirming a good accuracy of the\nsunset mode ILAS-II data.\n[31] From the comparisons of ILAS-II ozone data with\nthe other established data, the systematic negative bias\nfound in the NH (sunrise mode) above 41 km suggests that\nthere should be some unconsidered items in the current\nretrieval algorithm. The most possible item is an unresolved\nproblem in the measured signals due to a distortion in the\nentrance slit [Nakajima et al., 2006a] which we did not\nexpect before the launch. This feature is particularly evident\nabove 40 km in the sunrise mode (owing probably to the\ndifference in the measurement sequence of the sunrise mode\ncompared to that of the sunset mode). Consequently, this\naffects retrieved vertical profiles of gas species to varying\ndegrees, depending on gases and altitudes (or concentra-\ntions) (T. Yokota et al., unpublished manuscript, 2006). For\ninstance, M. K. Ejiri et al. (Validation of Improved Limb\nAtmospheric Spectrometer (ILAS)-II version 1.4 nitrous\noxide and methane profiles, submitted to Journal of Geo-\nphysical Research, 2005) reported a more negative bias\neven above 25 km in the CH4 data than the ozone data in the\nNH. The retrieval algorithm of ILAS-II is still being\nupdated, considering a correction method for the measured\nsignals in the sunrise mode. After the update, a more\naccurate data set will be made public as was done in the\nILAS version 5.2 data set [Sasano, 2002, and references\ntherein] from the ILAS version 3.1 data set [Sasano et al.,\n1999, and references therein].\n7. Concluding Remarks\n[32] As the successor to ILAS for high-latitude strato-\nspheric observation (from October 1996 to June 1997), a\nFigure 9. Average of the RD values for each 5 km altitude bin, weighted by the number of coincident\npairs, from the results shown in Figures 3\u20138 (see text, section 6.3). Results for the Northern Hemisphere\nand the Southern Hemisphere (SH) are shown in the right and left plots, respectively. Note that only one\ncoincidence measurement pair is used in the SH comparison for HALOE, which is shown as a reference.\nD11S02 SUGITA ET AL.: OZONE PROFILES MEASURED BY ILAS-II\n13 of 15\nD11S02\nsolar occultation sensor, ILAS-II, was launched on board\nADEOS-II in December 2002. Unfortunately, like ILAS,\nILAS-II ceased operation within the year after launch in\nOctober 2003 because of a failure in the power supply of the\nsatellite. From January to October 2003, ILAS-II measured\n5890 vertical profiles of ozone concentrations between 7\nand 70 km. Assessment of ILAS-II ozone data quality in the\nversion 1.4 retrieval algorithm was made through compar-\nisons with coincident measurements of ozonesonde and four\nsatellite-borne solar occultation sensors.\n[33] The ILAS-II ozone data in the NH between 11 and\n40 km agree with the other data within \u00b110% (in terms of\nthe absolute difference divided by its mean value) for most\ncases, with the median coincident ILAS-II profiles being\nsystematically up to 10% higher below 20 km and up to\n10% lower between 21 and 40 km after screening possible\nsuspicious retrievals. Above 41 km, the negative bias\nbetween the NH ILAS-II ozone data and the other data\nincreases with increasing altitude and reaches 30% at 61\u2013\n65 km. In the SH, the ILAS-II ozone data agree with the\nother data within \u00b110% in the altitude range of 11\u201360 km,\nwith the median coincident profiles being on average up to\n10% higher below 20 km and up to 10% lower above 20 km.\nConsidering the accuracy of the other data used for this\ncomparative study, the version 1.4 ozone data are suitable\nfor quantitative analyses in the NH between 11 and 40 km and\nin the SH between 11 and 70 km.\n[34] Acknowledgments.
