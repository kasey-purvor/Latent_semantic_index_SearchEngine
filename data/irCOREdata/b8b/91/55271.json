For instance, \ntechnology-based behavioural interventions have been \ndeveloped in the fields of diet and exercise [1,2,3,4,6] \nchronic disease management [14,17] HIV prevention \n[25] and energy consumption [19,15] among others. \nAlthough these technologies are designed with the \nspecific aim of effecting change in user behaviour, very \nfew have implemented empirically established methods \nfor doing so [25].  Indeed, very little of the published \nwork on persuasive technology gives any specific \ninsights into the processes involved in behaviour \nchange, nor specific examples on how to apply these \nprocesses.   \nIn this paper, we describe how applications can benefit \nfrom some useful aspects of traditional behavioural \ninterventions, including adaptation to individual users \nand the increased use of aversive, as well as appetitive \nstimuli. We will then discuss how these processes can \nbe incorporated into the design phase of a persuasive \ntechnology application for energy consumption. \nUnderstanding Behavioural Interventions \nBehavioural psychology is the scientific study of \nlearning [5]. It is, by definition, practical and \npragmatic, as it presumes that all behaviour is \ndetermined by interactions with and feedback from the \norganisms\u2019 surrounding environment [22]. Successful \nbehaviour is maintained, while unsuccessful behaviour \nis not. For example, we will learn to slam the washing \nmachine door shut if that is the only way the machine \nwill power up. Mental constructs such as states of mind, \nfeelings, personalities and so on are rejected as \nexplanatory tools for behaviour as they cannot be \ndirectly manipulated.  \nCrucially, behavioural psychology suggests that \nbecause behaviour is determined by the environment, it \ncan be changed readily by analysis and manipulation of \nthat environment (see [20] for an excellent introduction \nto behavioural interventions; [7] for an in-depth \nanalysis). For this reason, we suggest that behavioural \npsychology is the ideal framework within which to \ndesign persuasive technologies.  Indeed, disregarding \nalmost 80 years of empirical findings in this field on \npredicting and controlling behaviour would seem \ninefficient.  The vocabulary of behavioural psychology \nhas been developed to describe the processes whereby \nenvironmental variables can be manipulated to bring \nabout change in behaviour.  As we will use this \nvocabulary for clarity from now on, we will first briefly \nprovide a definition of four useful terms:- \nOperant Conditioning describes the process whereby \nthe consequences of behaviour feed back to the \norganism and change the probability that the behaviour \nthat produced them will occur again [21].  Positive \nreinforcement, negative reinforcement and punishment \nare all particular instances of operant conditioning.   \nPositive Reinforcement describes a situation where the \npresentation of a stimulus as a consequence of an \ninstance of behaviour makes that behaviour more likely \nto occur in that context in future.  For example, in the \ncase of the faulty washing machine, the machine \nworking properly may increase the probability of \n 3 \nslamming the door shut in future.  If this is the case, \nthe machine powering on has functioned as a \nreinforcer; it has reinforced the behaviour of slamming \nthe door shut (i.e. increased the probability of it \nhappening again).  \nNegative Reinforcement describes a situation where the \nremoval of an existing stimulus as a consequence of an \ninstance of behaviour makes that behaviour more likely \nto occur in that context in future.  For example, \nlearning to close a door in order to prevent a cold \ndraught.  In this case, the removal of an ongoing \naversive stimulus (a draught) has functioned as a \n\u201creinforcer\u201d; it has reinforced the behaviour of closing \nthe door (i.e. increased the probability of it happening \nagain).  \nPunishment describes a situation where the \npresentation of a stimulus as a consequence of an \ninstance of behaviour makes that behaviour less likely \nto occur in that context in future.  For example, \ndangerous fouls in a sporting match may result in the \npresentation of a fine or temporary ban, therefore \nreducing the probability of it happening again.  \nThe Role of Aversive Stimuli in Persuasive \nTechnology \nMost Persuasive Technology applications aim to effect \nbehaviour change simply through offering simple \nrewards to users.  It is rare to find an application that \ntakes advantage of the full capabilities of operant \nconditioning, despite the fact that a combination of \npositive reinforcement, negative reinforcement and \npunishment is a fundamental aspect of how behaviour \nis learned and maintained in the natural environment \n[22].  For example, in an office a person will work hard \nin order to achieve a salary and the approval of \ncolleagues (positive reinforcement).  However, that \nperson\u2019s performance is also maintained by the \naversive stimuli that they are avoiding such as peer \ndisproval, suspension, termination of employment \n(forms of punishment) and poverty (working to escape \npoverty is an example of negative reinforcement), \nwhich will be delivered if the person does not work \nhard.   \nOne significant problem with designing behaviour \nchange programs that offer only rewards is that when a \nreward is not obtained, there is no meaningful feedback \ndelivered to the user at all.  It is difficult to evaluate \nwhat a person learns from a complete lack of feedback \nupon failure to meet targets.  Additionally, when \nfeedback is not presented, the control over what the \nperson learns is taken out of the hands of the program \ndesigner and can lead to the development of \nproblematic \u201cfolk theories\u201d (see [8,9,17] for a \ndiscussion of how such folk theories can impact energy \nconsumption). We suggest that Persuasive \nTechnologies may benefit from the delivery of aversive \nstimuli when a user does not meet behavioural targets, \nas this will increase the overall frequency of feedback \ndelivered to users and, consequently, the control of the \nintervention over the users behaviour.  \nInterestingly, computer games typically consist of a \ncomplex system in which decisions are made and \nmeaningful feedback is delivered in a timely fashion. \nGames are a perfect example of how technology can \nexploit a combination of positive reinforcement, \nnegative reinforcement and punishment in order to \nmaintain the motivation and engagement of users.  For \nexample the basic act of accumulating points and \n 4 \nadvancement through levels are forms of positive \nreinforcement. Negative reinforcement is manifest in \nsome games by the ubiquitous requirement for players \nto re-start from the beginning of a level or stage when \nthey die or fail a mission (not wanting to waste time \nreplaying the easy parts of the same level over-and-\nover is a powerful motivator). Some games implement \npunishment systems; for example, where role-playing \ngames penalise players an amount of gained \nexperience points or inventory items when a character \ndies.  We suggest that technology designed to bring \nabout behaviour change in users would benefit from \ncareful and deliberate implementations of similarly \nsophisticated systems of reinforcement.   \nAdapting to Individual Users \nThe task of changing a person\u2019s behaviour appears to \nbe a task in delivering appropriate feedback when a \ntarget behaviour is detected.  However, the problem \nwith designing interventions for large numbers of \npeople is that there are very few, if any, stimuli that \nare universally reinforcing or universally punishing to all \npeople, since these definitions are dependent on each \npersons individual history.  The same stimulus can \nfunction as a reinforcer for one person and a punisher \nfor another.  For example, some people find listening to \nclassical music to be the highlight of their week, while \nmany find it boring.  Delicacies such as Caviar, \nKokoretsi (Organ meat), Oysters and Marmite are often \nseen as repulsive to different palates.  To continue the \nexample of having to re-play a failed level in a game, \nsome players will be motivated by this situation to \nperform better, while many other players will abandon \nthe game entirely due to frustration. \nWhen behavioural psychologists create a behaviour \nchange program, the first step is often to evaluate \nwhich stimuli the student\/patient will work for and \nwhich stimuli they find aversive.  One child may do \ntheir class-work diligently in exchange for gold stars, \nwhile another may work harder to avoid being put on \npencil-sharpening duty. The process of reacting to the \nimpact of a delivered reinforcer ensures that the \nrewards provided by the program are ones that the \nlearner is motivated to obtain.   \nPersuasive Technologies typically do not evaluate which \nstimuli, or types of stimuli, a person will work for, and \nwhich stimuli they find aversive.  Instead of evaluating \nwhat works for the individual, designers tend to \npresume that they know what will work on average for \na group of individuals. We argue that technology \ndesigned to effect behaviour change in users should \nattempt to continuously evaluate the effectiveness of \nthe feedback they provide in order to provide feedback \nthat is optimally effective for an individual.  For \nexample, if a technology is designed to generate \nenergy-related behaviour change through the display of \na cartoon polar bear and its habitat (e.g. [10]), some \nparticipants may find it entertaining to try and harm \nthe polar bear, thereby using unnecessary amounts of \nenergy and contradicting the goals of the project.  \nSystems designed to adapt to users\u2019 behaviour could, \n1) recognise that the deteriorating state of the polar \nbear and its environment is predicting increased energy \nconsumption and; 2) take appropriate action, such as \nto reverse the contingency, whereby the only way to \nworsen the polar bear\u2019s environment is through \nreduction in energy consumption.   \n 5 \nThus, we argue that any technology designed to change \nthe behaviour of users would benefit from delivering \nfeedback consistently, whether the user reaches \nbehavioural goals or not; and should also be able to \nmonitor the effectiveness of each stimulus delivered \nand adapt, so that the most effective strategy is used \nfor each user. However, from an application designer\u2019s \nperspective we realise this is a very broad statement \nand is, perhaps, easier said than done. In order to \nmake our argument more relevant to the HCI \ncommunity, the next section describes a complete \nconcept application, \u201cNag-baztag\u201d, as an example of a \npersuasive technology designed explicitly to use the \nmixed approach to motivating behaviour change we \nhave proposed in this paper. \nNag-Baztag \nNag-baztag is conceived as a device for helping users \nbecome more environmentally friendly in their kitchens. \nDomestic energy usage has been recognised as a key \ncontributor to global climate change [16]. In addition, \ndomestic energy consumption has increased 30% since \nthe 1970\u2019s. Clearly, this behaviour trend is not \nsustainable, with the use of voluntary or potentially \nenforced interventions likely to become a reality.  \nKitchens are perhaps one of the most resource hungry \nrooms in the average household, being a focal point for \nusing large amounts of power, gas and water through \ndaily activity. Therefore, changes in behaviour around \nthe use of appliances and resources in the kitchen can \nhave an effect on the environmental impact of the \nentire household, and help reverse the trend of \nincreasing carbon emissions. The complexity and \nmisconceptions around green issues make them an \nideal topic for which to develop technologies that aim to \ninterpret and alter ongoing behaviour. \nThe Nag-baztag is an Internet connected agent that is \nable to monitor power usage on a per-appliance basis, \nand able to track water and gas usage through \nnetworked metering devices. The application is \nembodied in the form of a physical agent, here \nrepresented by a \u201cNabaztag\u201d rabbit device1. The \nNabaztag is a wirelessly connected rabbit that acts as \nthe human-facing interface to the system, and is set up \nin the kitchen itself. Previous work has demonstrated \nthe effectiveness of using such embodied agents for \ngiving evaluative feedback to users [24]. All of the \ntechnology, including the Nabaztag and the various \nmeters that form the technical infrastructure for the \nconcept, are currently either available off-the-shelf or \notherwise easily constructed. Indeed, previous studies \nhave demonstrated how meters for measuring gas, \nelectricity and water consumption can be linked \ntogether in a single display [11].   \nEnabling Technology  \n\u201cSmart meters\u201d have become a very common tool for \nmonitoring energy usage in residential situations. The \nUK government has recently begun plans to have smart \nmeters for gas and electricity installed in every home \nby 2020 [23]. Typically they either connect directly to \nthe mains electricity supply, or at the point where an \nappliance is connected to a power socket. In addition, a \nflow meter can easily be attached to a kitchen sink to \ncollect information on water usage.  All of these devices \nare able to provide rich information on current and \nhistorical usage data for each appliance and household. \n                                                  \n1 See http:\/\/www.violet.net for more about the Nabaztag device \n 6 \nMore advanced versions, such as those employed in our \ncurrent concept, are able to transmit usage data in a \nsemantic format via a wireless network to be analysed \non a computer or on the web (e.g. \u201cHolmes\u201d software \nfor Wattson meters2). The reporting capabilities of all \nthese devices form the input for the system to measure \na person\u2019s energy usage patterns in a very finely \ndetailed manner.   \nIn addition to the rich input provided to the system in \norder to calculate energy usage behaviours, the system \nalso has the capability to exert effects on this \nconnected kitchen in a limited fashion. Each point \nwhere an appliance is plugged into a socket has a \n                                                  \n2 http:\/\/www.diykyoto.com\/uk\/holmes\/why-use-holmes \nsimple electrical relay system that \nallows power to the socket to be \nswitched on or off based on \ninstructions from the software \nitself. \nChanging Behaviours \nWith the technology described \nabove, the system is able to \nmonitor the energy usage patterns \nof the user. The objective is to \nchange these behaviours in a \npositive way \u2013 reducing \nconsumption of power, gas and \nwater and therefore reducing both \nthe cost of these resources for the \nuser and the environmental impact \nof their kitchen activities generally. \nBy analysing patterns of usage in \nthe kitchen, the system is able to identify certain \nenvironmentally detrimental behaviours that should be \ntargets for improvement. The system has a variety of \ntools based on operant conditioning techniques that can \nbe used to attempt to effect positive behaviour change \nin the user. \nIn a kitchen there are a wide variety of such \nenvironmentally detrimental behaviours, but this \nconcept will focus on kettle usage for illustrative \npurposes. Boiling an electric kettle is an extremely \ninefficient use of energy, therefore should only be used \nwhen strictly necessary. When making a cup of tea for \nexample, using the kettle is unavoidable.  However it is \nimportant that energy isn\u2019t wasted by boiling more \nwater than is necessary. If a kettle is boiled twice in a \n \n \nFigure 1 \u2013 The system collects \nusage data from wireless meters \nconnected to water pipes, gas \npipes in addition to electricity \nusage from meters connected to \nsockets used by individual kitchen \nappliances. \n \n 7 \nrow without any water having been drawn through the \nkitchen tap, this is an indicator that the kettle was \ninitially filled up with more water than necessary \u2013 and \ntherefore this activity is identified as a negative \nbehaviour to be addressed.  \nPositive Reinforcement - Nag-baztag can use \npositive reinforcement to teach the user to change their \nhabit of filling the kettle with too much water. This can \nbe done in any number of ways popular in PTs \ngenerally. For example, when the user only draws the \ncorrect amount of water, they can be rewarded with \npraise, or a virtual \u201cgold star\u201d, or even just by letting \nthem know how much money they have saved so far \n(this is in effect the same as accumulating points in a \ncomputer game). \nNegative reinforcement \u2013 People will \nwork to avoid an ongoing aversive \nstimulus.  The aversive stimulus that \npeople must work to avoid in the Nag-\nbaztag application is the constant \nnagging by the Nabaztag device over \nthe amount of energy and water being \nused. For example, if, when a user goes \nto make a cup of tea, the tap is used to \ndraw more than a usual amount of \nwater, the rabbit will complain, for \nexample, that, \u201cYou should not use too \nmuch water because it costs money and \nmoney does not grow on trees!\u201d When \nthe electric kettle is switched on, the \nrabbit could remind the user \u201cOnly boil \nthe water you need, otherwise you are \nkilling the planet!\u201d It is suggested that \nthis nagging will constitute an aversive \nstimulus for most users (i.e., they will \nwork to avoid it).  Thus, whenever they want to make a \ncup of tea, that in the future they will be very careful to \nonly use the correct amount of water (in which case the \nrabbit remains quiet, or occasionally provides positive \nreinforcement). This will minimize the amount of \nnagging they will have to endure from that annoying \nrabbit, but will also reinforce the (positive) \nenvironmental behaviour of using kettles efficiently. \nPunishing Lapses in Good Behaviour - When a user \nfalls back into bad behaviour, or has lapses in \nconcentration that cause major expenditures in terms \nof resources, it may be necessary for the system to \napply a suitable punishment. Given the control the \nsystem has over the power supplied to the various \nFigure 2 \u2013 Repeated poor \nbehaviour can result in severe \npunishment as the agent has the \ncapability to turn off power to \nappliances at will. \n \n \n 8 \nappliances, these punishments have the possibility to \nbe very harsh indeed. \nFor example, if a user leaves the tap slightly on by \nmistake when going to work, the rabbit can issue a set \nof graded punishments. In the first instance this may \nbe simply a long nagging session when they return \nhome, or constant reminders while at work via email, \nSMS (text) messages or even Twitter and Facebook \nabout their poor water-usage behaviour. \nOn future occasions the rabbit may issue ultimatums \u2013 \n\u201cIf you don\u2019t come home IN THE NEXT HOUR and turn \nthe tap off, there will be consequences!\u201d, and from then \non issue very real punishments. For example, it may \nnever allow the user to use the kettle to boil water (by \nswitching the appliance off at the socket whenever it is \nused), or perhaps on the third punishment, the rabbit \nmay decide that the user has gone too far, and \ntherefore while the user is at work it switches the \npower off to the freezer, allowing the perishable \ncontents to defrost and spoil during a long hot summer \nday! \nThe fact that the punishments may not themselves be \nvery environmentally friendly is beside the point \u2013 it \nwas always the user\u2019s fault and the rabbit always has \nthe classic excuse \u201cI warned you and you MADE me do \nit!\u201d \nAdapting to users \nThe most important aspect of the system is its \nadaptability. It is key that the persuasive techniques \nused by the system depend entirely on what is effective \nfor the individual using the system.  For example, some \npeople may find the constant nagging of the Nag-\nbaztag to be entertaining. Other people may resent the \npunishments and stop using the system when it keeps \npreventing them from boiling the kettle (This is the \nsame as a computer gamer quitting the game in \nfrustration at having to re-play the same mission \nagain). \nTherefore, the system has to be reactive; monitoring \nactivity and linking changes in behaviour with energy \nconsumption over time, based on feedback delivered. If \nnagging leads to an increase in energy consumption (or \neven simply no decrease in consumption), then it will \nstop nagging and choose another feedback mechanism \n(e.g. perhaps rewards based on incremental changes). \nThe combination of feedback mechanisms changes over \ntime based on what strategies have been most \nsuccessful. \nAdditionally, a single user with several different \nnegative behaviours may respond to different feedback \nfor each behaviour (e.g. nagging is effective for boiling \nthe kettle, but rewards are more effective for keeping \nthe thermostat low) and effectiveness may change over \ntime. Therefore, persuasive systems in general must \nconstantly re-evaluate users\u2019 responses to feedback \nand be highly adaptive, in order to maximise the \neffectiveness of the technology. \nDiscussion \nIn this paper we have argued that persuasive \ntechnologies rely too much on positive reinforcement, \nwhich is only one aspect of successful behaviour \nchange programmes. We propose that technologies \nthat attempt to change behaviours should take \nadvantage of the full variety of operant conditioning \ntechniques in order to maximise their effectiveness. In \n 9 \nparticular, we have highlighted that existing persuasive \ntechnology fails to take advantage of negative \nreinforcement and punishment as tools for effecting \npositive changes in behaviour and makes no attempt to \nadapt persuasive techniques to individual users. \nWe have introduced the Nag-baztag concept, which is \nan illustrative application for teaching positive, \nenvironmentally friendly, behaviours within a domestic \nkitchen environment. The unique and potentially \ncontroversial aspect of the application is that the \nlearning is based on an adaptive approach, and this \nexplicitly includes negative reinforcement and potential \nfor punishment with real negative consequences. \nThe Nag-baztag concept is provided as a case study to \nillustrate clearly how the psychological concepts of \noperant conditioning can be genuinely applied to real \npurposes generally in the field of HCI applications, \nrather than simply dismissed as theoretical concerns. In \nfact we give direct examples of how computer game \napplications already use a wide range of different \nreinforcement techniques to increase engagement in \nthe game, and how these same techniques can be used \nto motivate real change above and beyond simple \nengagement. \nIndeed, this paper serves to demonstrate how the field \nof persuasive technologies need not be a \u201cresearch \nisland\u201d and can take direct advantage of 80 years of \nresearch in behavioural science to make more effective \nand engaging applications. \nReferences \n[1] Baranowski, T, Baranowski, J., Cullen, KW, Marsh, \nT, Islam, N, Zakeri, I, Honess-Morreale, L, and DeMoor, \nC.
