Introduction \nCurrently composite structures are joined by either mechanical fastening or adhesive bonding. The \nintegrity of a structure is critically dependent on these structural joints. For bolted joints the highly \nconcentrated stresses at fastener holes and the free edge effect will initiate fatigue damage [1]. The \nsubsequent crack growth may appear as both in-plane fractures and out-of-plane delaminations, \ndepending essentially on the laminate thickness [2]; relatively thin composite plates are affected by in-\nplane cracking, while thick shells are prone to cumulated interlaminar damage in the form of \ndistributed delaminations.  \nBetter damage tolerance performances is usually achieved by adhesively bonded joints, since the \ncontinuity of the fibres is not broken by fastening holes and in-plane fatigue crack growth is prevented \n[3]. However solely bonded joints are susceptible to out-of-plane damage in the form of delamination \nand disbond; this is the consequence of the relatively weak interlaminar strength of conventional \nadhesive joints [4].   \nThrough-thickness reinforcement has been proved to be an effective way to prevent or retard \ndelamination growth by improving the interlaminar strength [5]. The reinforcement can be applied in \nthe form of small diameter pins, stitches, or 3D interlocked fabrics. The physics ruling the improved \nout-of-plane load bearing capability is complex and dependent on the specific type of reinforcement.  \nThis paper focuses on Z-fibre reinforced (or z-pinned) joints. The technique is applied by inserting \nsmall diameter metallic or fibrous pins in the thickness direction, i.e. the local laminate \u201cZ\u201d axis. The \ninsertion is performed on uncured laminates with an ultrasonic gun; it is a relatively low-cost process \n[6]. Z-pin insertion slightly affects the in-plane mechanical properties of composite laminates. For \nexample, a 10 to 15 per cent loss of in-plane mechanical properties is found in pinned laminates, but \nthe out-of-plane stiffness is significantly increased by 25% [7]. The in-plane elastic properties are \ndependent on Z-fibre diameter and volumetric density, but less dependent on the laminate stacking \nsequence.  \nExtensive experimental campaign has been carried out to asses the damage tolerance capability of Z-\nfibre reinforced composite laminates; the positive influence of reinforcing Z-fibres on delamination \ngrowth has been assessed by testing standard DCB, MMB, lap and T-joint specimens [8-10] \ndemonstrating much improved damage tolerance capabilities. All types of through-thickness \nreinforcement delay delamination growth by bridging forces that constraint the crack opening \ndisplacements [11]. The bridging actions can be described by constitutive laws relating the crack \nopening displacements to the traction forces which arise in the crack wake [12].  \nSeveral researchers have worked on formulating Z-fibre constitutive laws and its applications in \nsimulation. Cox and Sridhar [13] developed an analytical micro-mechanical model for mixed-mode \nloading condition; the constitutive relation of through-thickness reinforcement is obtained in the form \nof non-linear implicit function relating the crack opening displacements to the bridging forces. Yan et \nal. [14-15] performed FE analysis of delamination growth in Z-fibre reinforced DCB and ENF \nspecimens, under modes I and II conditions, respectively. The constitutive model of Z-pins is \ndescribed by an empirical load vs. displacement curve, obtained by fitting experimental data of single \npin pullout test. A similar approach was employed also by Cartie and Partridge [16]. Recently, \nempirical bi-linear constitutive law has been employed by Ratcliffe and O\u2019Brien [17] for predicting \nthe mechanical response of Z-fibre reinforced DCB specimens, in which an empirical Z-pin bridging \nlaw was incorporated into an analytical model of DCB employing the classical beam theory. A similar \nproblem was studied by Grassi and Zhang [18] by FEA implementing the Cox and Sridhar model. All \naforementioned work has studied the original Z-fibre pins having typical diameter of 0.28 \u2013 0.5 mm, \nbut a recent study has investigated bonding reinforcement by larger diameter pins (2 mm) inserted into \nholes drilled through a bonded lap joint section [19]. Significant gains were demonstrated in ultimate \nstrength and resistance to debond growth, and the modelling technique was successful.       \nThis paper presents an efficient design tool using the FEM for Z-fibre reinforced composite joints. A \nconstitutive model for Z-fibre mechanical response has been developed by the authors [20], which has \nthe main advantage of being fully analytical and explicit, thus its implementation into a commercial \nFE package is largely simplified. The computational approach is validated by experimental test data \ncomprising the response of a standard T-joint and a complex cruciform joint subjected to quasi-static \nloading regimes.    \n2. A mixed mode constitutive model for Z-fibre response \nThe qualitative phenomenology of Z-fibre mechanical response is sketched in Fig. 1 showing a single \nZ-fibre embedded in a composite laminate. Z-fibre\u2019s initial position is normal to the laminate plane. \nWhen apply the resultant external displacement u = [u, w]T Z-fibre is displaced in both the \nlongitudinal (x) direction and the transverse (z) direction. This motion is resisted by a set of forces \nexerted on the Z-fibre by the surrounding laminate. The vector sum of these forces can be equivalently \nrepresented by the stress resultant T = [TX, TZ]T acting on the Z-fibre section at the delamination plane \nz=0. This resultant also represents the Z-fibre bridging forces that oppose the delamination opening \nmotion and can be described by: \nT = T(u) (1) \nA constitutive model has been developed by the authors [20] to express equation (1) explicitly. This \nwas achieved by assuming the Z-fibre being a perfectly rigid body embedded in an orthotropic elastic \nfoundation representing the surrounding composite laminate and by establishing and solving a set of \nequilibrium equations involving all the stresses and displacements. A brief summary of this solution is \ngiven below and key equations in Appendix A.  \nZ-fibre response behaviour is modelled by two distinct stages, i.e. pure elastic deformation of Z-fibre \nbefore it debonds from the base laminate and the progressive pullout of Z-fibre. Debond is assumed to \noccur instantaneously and to mark the transition between the two stages. The pin\u2019s rigid movement \nwithin the laminate is sketched in Fig. 2, where L is the pin insertion length and \u03c6 the initial insertion \nangle. The delamination face is identified by the plane z = 0, and x-axis is assumed to be locally \ntangent to the delamination edge. Due to the external force T, each point constituting the pin (P) is \nsubjected to a rigid motion with three components: (1) rigid rotation \u03c8 around the y-axis; positive \nanticlockwise, (2) rigid transversal translation uB along the x-axis, and (3) rigid axial displacement wsl \nalong the pin axis. When Z-fibre is still bonded to the base laminate, the pin only has rigid rotation and \nwsl=0. The axial displacement wsl will occur during the pin pullout stage. Due to these rigid \nmovements point P reaches two intermediate positions, P' and P'', and final position P'''. The \nsummation of the rigid motions is commutative, so the order of the displacements can be permuted by \nchoice. \nThe base laminate surrounding the pin reacts to the pin\u2019s rigid motion by following set of distributed \nforces: (1) an elastic foundation force qz acting along the z-axis opposing the rigid displacement u, (2) \nan elastic foundation force qx acting along the x-axis opposing the rigid displacement w, and (3) a \ndistributed force p acting on the pin lateral surface, which is necessary to equilibrate the distributed \nforce qz; p arises because of the interfacial stresses and friction between the Z-fibre lateral surface and \nthe surrounding orthotropic elastic foundation. Fig. 3 qualitatively shows the distributions of these \nreaction forces acting on the pin in the case of pure mode II loading. It is worth mentioning that a pure \nmode II loading condition occurs only if the Z-fibre is inserted normally to the delamination plane, i.e. \n\u03c6 = 0, and the applied displacement is on the delamination plane, i.e. w = 0. If the insertion angle is \npositive or the load is not pure shear the resulting opening process is always a mixed mode one. Mixed \nmode condition also occurs for a zero insertion angle as soon as the Z-fibre starts to rotate by angle \u03c8. \nTherefore pure mode II condition hardly exists with respect to the Z-fibre rigid kinematics, since an \naxial force component is always present when an external shear action is applied; the axial force can \nproduce pullout if the cosine value of the angle between the external force and the pin orientation is \npositive. On the other hand a pure mode I loading condition can occur if the Z-fibre has a zero \ninsertion angle and if the applied external displacement is normal to the delamination plane; in this \nspecial condition the model is still valid, but the soil elastic reactions qz and qx are always zero and the \npullout is resisted only by the distributed superficial force p, which depends on the friction between \nthe Z-fibre lateral surface and the embedding composite laminate.  \nThe key parameters ruling the Z-fibre response are the elastic foundation moduli featuring the \nembedding laminate kx and kz, the half insertion depth L, the insertion angle \u03c6, and Z-fibre diameter \nand volumetric density. See equations in Appendix A. The only unknown parameters which appear in \nthe model equations are the laminate elastic foundation moduli kx and kz and a critical rotation angle \nfor debonding \u03c8d. This latter represents the amount of rigid rotation that must be reached in order to \nbreak the adhesive bond between the pin and the embedding laminate so that to start the pullout phase.  \nThe mode I opening behaviour is a special case of the general mixed mode response of Z-fibres; the \nexperimental investigation of this particular problem is particularly interesting, since it allows to \nestimate the role of friction during the Z-fibre pullout regardless to other parameters. On the other \nhand the investigation of the mode II condition, or mode II dominated mixed mode ones, Z-fibre \nmechanical response is much more complex, since all aforementioned parameters play significant \nroles in the bridging law. For a detailed discussion the reader is referred to [20].  \nThe main difference in Z-fibre behaviour between the mode I and mixed mode cases is the amount of \nenergy absorption in the pre-debonding stage: in mode I pre-debonding stage absorbs only 1% of the \ntotal amount of energy spent to extract the Z-fibre from the surrounding laminate; hence it is almost \nnegligible. For mode II or mode II dominated mixed mode condition, the pre-debonding stage expend \nabout 40% of the total elastic energy. This characteristic behaviour is clearly captured by the present \nbridging model and supported by experimental evidence [8, 10, 20].  \n3. T-joint pull-off: experimental tests and numerical simulations \n3.1 Problem statement \nThe geometry of the T-joint is sketched in Fig. 4. The joint was made of Hexcel G986\/M36 \ncarbon\/epoxy fabric pre-preg, whose mechanical properties are reported in Table 1. The supporting \nbase of the joint was made of 8 pre-preg layers, each 0.28 mm thick, with [0\/(45)2\/(0)5] orientation, \nresulting in a total thickness tS = 2.24 mm. The flange was fabricated using 10-ply laminate \n[45\/(0)2\/(45)2\/(0)5] of the same material, having a thickness tf =2.8 mm. The web was made of the \nsame material with [0, 45]S having thickness tw = 1.12 mm. The supported length of the joint is L = \n80mm, the total height H = 40 mm, and the width W = 40 mm. End-tabs were added to the web to \nprovide a proper redistribution of the load applied by the jig. The central core radius of the joint was \nfilled by insertion of a composite filling noodle made of G986\/M36 fabric. The flange-to-base bond \nwas reinforced by insertion of T300\/BMI Z-pins with variable pin diameter and volumetric density.  \nThe T-joints were tested by applying a quasi-static tensile load up to the final failure. The failure is \ndue to the delamination growth both in the flange-to-skin bond and in the web adhesive layer; this \nobservation was confirmed by photographic recording of delamination growth and post-failure \nexaminations. \n3.2 Simulation technique \nA numerical procedure has been established to simulate the delaminations growth in the               T-\njoint. Only one quarter of the joint was modelled due to its x and z symmetries. A detailed 3D FE \nmodel of the T-joint was built and analysed by NASTRAN, in which 4-noded laminate shell elements \n(CQUAD4) were employed to model the structure. Interface \u201cspring\u201d elements (CELAS2) were used \nto simulate the peel and shear response of the adhesive layer [21] according to the properties given in \nTable 1. The spring elements act as elastic connections between two bonded laminates which are \ngoing to be separated during the debond growth. The elements in the flange-to-skin overlap are square, \nhaving an area of 1 mm2. Details can be found in [22].   \nA set of MATLAB subroutines have been written to manage the simulation of debond initiation and \ngrowth process; these subroutines perform post-processing analysis of the FE results by acquiring the \nvalues of the spring axial forces and calculating the peel and shear stresses within the adhesive layer. \nThe damage initiation is predicted by the Tsai-Hill failure criterion; when it is satisfied for any set of \nspring elements, these are automatically deleted from the model, thus simulating the delamination \nonset. \nAfter damage initiation, the debond growth process is modelled by a fracture mechanics approach: the \nstrain energy release rate (SERR) at the debond tips is calculated by the virtual crack closure technique \n(VCCT) [23] and a discrete set of springs is removed from the model whenever the energy based \ncriterion is satisfied. The critical values of the mode I and mode II SERR were evaluated by DCB and \nMMB tests on the G986\/M36 composite, yielding GIC = 1250 J\/m2, GIIC = 1100 J\/m2 [10]. Thus the \ncomposite employed is considerably tougher than most other commercial CFRP. The FE simulation is \ndisplacement-controlled: once a debond initiates, iterative static analyses are performed at constant \nexternal displacement, updating the debond geometry until the crack front reaches a stable \nconfiguration. In this condition the load and displacement values are saved and the analysis goes on by \nincreasing the applied displacement at a prescribed step. The simulation ends when the flange is \ncompletely detached from the supporting base skin.  \nIf the joint is reinforced by Z-pins, then after the local adhesive failure the linear springs are \nsubstituted by 1D nonlinear elements (PBUSH1D), whose load-displacement response is governed by \nthe pin\u2019s bridging law during the progressive debonding and pullout phases using the model described \nin Section 2. As already mentioned the value of Z-fibre frictional sliding shear (\u03c4) can be \nexperimentally assessed by mode I single pin pull-out test. However, in the present study this value \nwas estimated by calibrating the constitutive model with the T-joint experimental load-displacement \nresponse against the FE analysis results.  \n3.3 Results and discussion  \nFollowing four different test cases have been simulated: \n1. unpinned T-joint (control case); \n2. Pinned T-joint (Z-fibre fibre diameter = 0.28 mm, volumetric density = 2%); \n3. Pinned T-joint (Z-fibre fibre diameter = 0.28 mm, volumetric density = 4%); \n4. Pinned T-joint (Z-fibre fibre diameter = 0.50 mm, volumetric density = 2%). \nThe experimental tests have revealed that debonds grow both in the flange-to-skin interface and also in \nthe web adhesive layer. To simplify the simulation two different scenarios were considered, both \ninvolving a fixed debond length existing in the web: in case A) the web defect size is 5mm, and in \ncase B) the defect size is 10 mm. The FE result for the control case is shown in Fig. 5. It is observed \nthat the joint stiffness variation due to the different web defect size is negligible, but using the 5 mm \nweb defect length the joint failure load and displacement are both significantly underestimated; \ntherefore case B) scenario is employed for the following analyses of pinned joints. \nFirstly, the nonlinear behaviour of z-pin pullout during debond growth for this specific material and \nbonding strength is assessed. A suitable frictional sliding shear \u03c4 in the pin constitutive model was \nfound by calibrating the FE model results with the experimental data: the higher the frictional sliding \nshear, the slower the flange-to-base debond will grow.  \nFig. 6 shows the case using 0.28 mm Z-fibre and 2% volumetric density. The FE analysis \nunderestimates the experimental load-displacement response if using \u03c4 = 15 MPa. A satisfactory \nagreement is achieved by increasing the z-pin pullout friction to 30 MPa. Adding a 2% volumetric \ndensity of 0.28mm diameter pins will increase the ultimate load by about 8% and the failure \ndisplacements by 5%. However, according to the FE analysis z-pinning has very little effect on the \ndamage initiation, which occurred at about 1260N (or 2.9 mm in terms of applied displacement). \nComparing to the control case, the pinned joint is more damage tolerant, though the benefit is quite \nmarginal. \nThe analysis for the 0.28 mm pin diameter and 4% volumetric density case is shown in Fig. 7. In this \ncase pinning proves to be very efficient in delaying the flange-to-base debond growth: both the \nultimate strength and failure displacement are now increased by about 10%. The FE analysis shows \nonly a small debond propagation after the onset, which once again occurs at the same load level found \nfor the unpinned joint; the failure is less progressive than the previous lower density pinned \nconfiguration, but it occurs at higher load and displacement.   \nFinally the joint pinned with larger pins at 2% volumetric density is presented in Fig. 8. From a \nphysical point of view, increasing the pin diameter is almost equivalent to raising the frictional sliding \nshear \u03c4, because the insertion of a larger pin provides a larger displacement for the surrounding \nlaminate, which will react by applying larger residual stress on the pin. So this increase in\u03c4 is \nbeneficial to joint strength. On the other hand a sensible loss of in-plane mechanical properties should \nbe expected, due to the larger local misalignment of the in-plane laminate. A good agreement between \nthe FE and experimental results is obtained by increasing the frictional sliding shear to 40 MPa to take \ninto account of the larger pin effect. The resulting effect on the T-joint load-displacement curve is \nclose but somewhat below that achieved by adding 2% of 0.28mm diameter pins. This result is not \nsurprising, since the local bridging forces exerted by the pins are now smeared over a larger area due \nto the fact that the distance between two adjacent pins is a linear decreasing function of the Z-pin \ndiameter if the volumetric fraction is kept constant.     \nTo summarise Z-pinning are effective in delaying debond growth under mode I loading by increasing \nthe joint ultimate strength and debond crack length. Nevertheless the onset of debond cracks is not \ninfluenced by Z-fibre\u2019s presence and the larger Z-fibre diameter can have a detrimental effect on the \nin-plane mechanical properties.  \n4. Cruciform Joint: experimental tests and numerical simulation \n4.1 Problem statement \nIn this section the mechanical response of a cruciform composite joint subjected to biaxial tensile \nloading is presented. The joint consisting of intersecting stiffeners is capable of carrying loads in \northogonal directions and thus can be employed as supporting frames to build integrally-stiffened thin \nshell structures. Fig. 9 shows a sketch of the novel joint. The joints were manufactured by \nconventional pre-preg lay-up employing 914\/G803 carbon\/epoxy fabrics arranged in a + 45\u00b0 \norientation. The average ply thickness is 0.25 mm. The joint arm length is 250 mm both in the x and y \naxis, the web height is 50 mm, the web thickness is 0.5 mm, the top and bottom flange thickness is 1 \nmm, and the overlapping region thickness is 2 mm. The forces acting on the four arms are exchanged \nvia longitudinal extensions of each upper plate segment, which form a 2 x 2 mosaic on the central \n\u201coverlapping\u201d area. This arrangement provides additional strength to the whole assembly; \nconventional cruciform joints are fabricated simply by bonding four \u201cL\u201d shaped plates, so the ultimate \nstrength is merely the adhesive ultimate peel strength multiplied by the contact area. In the orthogonal \njoint another bonded surface, the overlapping region, is added to the basic design, thus it should \nincrease the ultimate strength. However, since the adhesive layers in the overlapping region work \nunder pure shear loads, this 50 x 50 mm overlapping region still is a critical area for the joint integrity. \nHence, Z-pins were inserted in this region to increase the bonding strength.   \n4.2 Simulation Technique \nThe simulation strategy employed for the analysis of the cruciform joint is essentially identical to that \nfor the T-joint case, except that the overlapping area susceptible to debond failure is subjected to \nnearly pure shear action. The general constitutive model for Z-fibre response under mixed mode loads \nwas employed. Due to the structural symmetry only one quarter of the joint was modelled. During the \nexperimental tests a displacement-controlled quasi-static bi-axial tensile load was applied to the joint \narms; the load ratio of the x and y axis is 2:1.  \n4.3 Results and discussion \nAn un-pinned \u201ccontrol\u201d and two Z-fibre pinned joints have been tested. Z-fibre density was 4% in the \npinned cases with variable Z-fibre diameter from 0.28 mm to 0.51 mm. These tests were simulated to \nprovide inside of the stress distribution and failure mechanism. For the 0.28mm diameter pin the \nnumerical model predicts the maximum bridging force of 40 N exerted by each pin at 0.5 mm crack \nsurface displacement; for the 0.51 mm diameter pin the maximum bridging force rises to 130 N at \n0.9mm crack displacement. The actual bridging force values employed in the FE model depend on the \nmesh size, since the bridging actions must be scaled by the ratio between the element area and the \neffective unit cell surface.  \nThe simulation results performed on a quarter model employing the Z-fibre constitutive law [20] are \nsummarized in Fig. 10. It is observed that Z-fibres have very little effect on the initiation and growth \nof the debonds within the top overlap, since under mode II dominated loading condition quite large \ncrack face displacements must be reached to gain sufficiently high pin bridging forces. Nevertheless \ndebond growth is sensibly delayed at higher load levels; the pinned joints exhibit considerably \nimproved ultimate strength. The 0.51 mm diameter pins are less effective than the 0.28 mm ones, \nsince, at the same pin density, the effectively pinned area for the former is less than the latter. \nAccording to the FE analysis, for the unpinned joint the complete debond of the overlapping areas \noccurred at 18 kN of applied load in the primary load arm (x-axis) which agrees very well with the \nexperimental data for the control case. Failures started from the complete debond of the top overlap \nfollowed by a quick in-plane cracking of the web close to the joint centre. This ultimate load increased \nto 20 kN for the 0.51 mm pin diameter case and to 22 kN for the 0.28 mm diameter. The FE analyses \nrevealed a second failure mode, which was also found in the experimental test. This failure occurred at \nthe adhesive bond-lines at the edges of the top overlap. The one-quarter model allows estimating the \ninternal forces transferred from one overlap to the other, since symmetry constraints have been placed \nalong the edges. The forces acting in the primary load direction for an external force 20 kN are beyond \n100 N, so tensile stresses about 100 MPa should be attained at the interfaces between the overlapping \narms. These tensile stresses are high enough to break the resin bonds at the edges of the overlapping \narms, thus leading to the bond-lines failure, which has been actually observed for Z-pinned joints. The \nbond-line failure does not occur in the un-pinned joint, since the ultimate strength is below 20 kN, \nwhile it can affect the Z-pinned joints since the ultimate shear strength of the top overlap is increased \nby pinning. For the Z-fibre reinforced joints the failure occurred just after the bond-lines breakage \nwithin the top overlap followed by a quick growth of cracks in the web; the final collapse occurs at \naround 19 kN, very close to the load level predicted by the FE analysis. The delaminated area in the \ntop overlap is smaller than that of the unpinned joint and the experimental evidence supports the \nsimulation results. \n5. Conclusions \nThis work presents an FE analysis of two kinds of adhesively bonded composite joints reinforced by \nZ-fibres. Linear elastic fracture mechanics is applied to evaluate the delamination\/debond progression \nin these structural joints under general mixed mode loads. The modelling approach incorporates a \npost-processing step on the computation of the strain energy release rate at the delamination\/debonds \nfronts and z-fibre bridging forces. The computation is performed in the MATLAB environment \nemploying NASTRAN as the main processor for the FE analysis. The method also incorporates a \nconstitutive model of Z-fibre response under mixed mode loading previously developed by the \nauthors. \nThe mechanical responses of a composite T-joint and a cruciform joint subjected to tensile static load \nare employed as benchmark problems to validate the numerical technique for simulating delamination \ngrowth in Z-fibre reinforced structural joints. The FE simulation yields satisfactory agreement with the \nexperimental load-displacements curves for the T-joint. The insertion of Z-fibres in the flange-to-skin \nbond improves the damage tolerance capabilities by increasing both ultimate strength and the failure \npull-off displacement. The effects of variable Z-fibre volumetric densities and diameters are correctly \npredicted. The test demonstrates that Z-fibres are particularly effective in retarding the \ndelamination\/debond growth in pure mode I loading; nevertheless it has been also demonstrated that \nthe onset of debond cracks is not influenced by Z-fibre\u2019s presence and larger Z-fibre size can have \ndetrimental effect on the in-plane mechanical properties.  \nThe FE analyses have shown that the damage process in the cruciform joint has at least three different \nfailure modes, i.e. delamination of the bonded overlap top region, in-plane failure of the web laminate, \nand failure of the overlap bond-lines. The delamination growth within the overlap region, which is \ndriven by pure mode II fracture mechanism, is the most critical of the three, since it occurs at a low \nload level and affects the load distribution in the joint laminate. Both the in-plane crack growth in the \nweb and the bond-line failure occur at relatively high load levels when the overlap head of the joint \nhas been severely debonded. The insertion of Z-fibres in the overlap area significantly retards the \ndebond growth, even though it has no noticeable effect on the other two failure modes; therefore the \ndamage tolerance capability of the cruciform joint is only modestly improved by Z-fibre insertion. \nAcknowledgement \nThis work was funded by the DTI CARAD programme via the JOINTS project.
