Goal conflict and goal facilitation may influence whether health\nprofessionals engage in guideline-recommended behaviours, and may supplement the predictive power of the\ntheory of planned behaviour. We hypothesised that goal facilitation and goal conflict contribute to predicting\nprimary care health professionals\u2019 provision of physical activity advice to patients with hypertension, over and\nabove predictors of behaviour from the theory of planned behaviour.\nMethods: Using a prospective predictive design, at baseline we invited a random sample of 606 primary care\nhealth professionals from all primary care practices in NHS Grampian and NHS Tayside (Scotland) to complete\npostal questionnaires. Goal facilitation and goal conflict were measured alongside theory of planned behaviour\nconstructs at baseline. At follow-up six months later, participants self-reported the number of patients, out of those\nseen in the preceding two weeks, to whom they provided physical activity advice.\nResults: Forty-four primary care physicians and nurses completed measures at both time points (7.3% response\nrate). Goal facilitation and goal conflict improved the prediction of behaviour, accounting for substantial additional\nvariance (5.8% and 8.4%, respectively) in behaviour over and above intention and perceived behavioural control.\nConclusions: Health professionals\u2019 provision of physical activity advice in primary care can be predicted by\nperceptions about how their conflicting and facilitating goal-directed behaviours help and hinder giving advice,\nover and above theory of planned behaviour constructs. Incorporating features of multiple goal pursuit into the\ntheory of planned behaviour may help to better understand health professional behaviour.\nBackground\nKnowledge translation (KT), the application of research\nevidence into clinical practice, has been characterised as\na haphazard process [1]. The KT process can be broken\ndown into a series of behaviours performed by indivi-\nduals to reach a goal (i.e., goal-directed behaviours, or\nGDBs). When viewed as such, theories of human beha-\nviour can be employed to identify factors that predict\nthe behaviours involved in translating research evidence\ninto practice [2]. For example, clinical practice guide-\nlines in the UK recommend that primary care health\nprofessionals provide all patients, and especially those at\ngreater cardiovascular risk, with advice on engaging in\nregular physical activity (PA) for health promotion and\ndisease prevention [3,4]. However, evidence suggests\nthat provision of PA advice is less than optimal [5,6]. By\nacknowledging the provision of PA advice as a health\nprofessional behaviour, behavioural theory can be used\nto understand factors that account for variability in opti-\nmal PA advice provision.\nAmong theories of behaviour, the theory of planned\nbehaviour (TPB) [7] has been tested across a variety of\npopulations, behaviours, and contexts [8]. The TPB sug-\ngests that behaviour is a function of four constructs:\nintention, attitude (evaluation of the behaviour), subjec-\ntive norm (perceived social pressures), and perceived\n* Correspondence: justin.presseau@ncl.ac.uk\n1Institute of Health and Society, Baddiley-Clark Building, Richardson Road,\nNewcastle University, Newcastle Upon Tyne, NE2 4AX, UK\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\nPresseau et al.

Intention, the key con-\nstruct in the model, is a proximal predictor of behaviour\nas well as a mediator of the effect of attitude and subjec-\ntive norm on behaviour and a partial mediator of the\neffect of PBC on behaviour. While the TPB is among the\nmodels with the best utility in predicting health profes-\nsionals\u2019 GDBs [9,10], it is not without its limitations [11].\nAmong them is the issue of behavioural segregation: the\nTPB focuses on a single GDB, isolated from other GDBs\nengaged in by health professionals. In contexts of multi-\nple goal pursuit, such as clinical consultations, these\nother GDBs may have a helpful or hindering influence on\na focal GDB. Competition for limited resources (e.g.,\ntime, energy) may lead to goal conflict. However, enga-\nging in some GDBs may be helpful and increase the like-\nlihood that a particular GDB is performed, thereby\nrepresenting goal facilitation. Goal conflict and goal facil-\nitation may influence the extent to which a health profes-\nsional engages in a given guideline-recommended\nbehaviour. If so, the incorporation of these constructs\ninto the behavioural pathway may supplement the expla-\nnatory power of the TPB and help to further understand\nKT processes. The current study aimed to explore\nwhether goal conflict and goal facilitation are predictive\nof health professional behaviour beyond the proximal\npredictors of behaviour from the TPB.\nThe TPB has been frequently used to predict health\nprofessional behaviour. A systematic review of social\ncognition models applied to predict health professional\nbehaviour identified 14 prospective studies testing the\nTPB with 1,882 health professionals [10]. The identified\nstudies explained a frequency-weighted mean of 35% of\nthe variance in health professional behaviour, and inten-\ntion and PBC were each consistent predictors of beha-\nviour [10]. Furthermore, when compared against other\nsocial cognition models within the same sample, the\nTPB is the most predictive model [9]. The TPB posits\nthat while additional background constructs might be\nrelevant to understanding behaviour, their effect should\nbe mediated through the model [12]. Nevertheless, a\nnumber of other social cognitive constructs have been\nproposed to supplement the TPB. For example, Godin\nand colleagues [10] hypothesised an augmented TPB\nthat includes additional predictors of intention (role and\nidentity, moral norm, and health professional character-\nistics) and behaviour (habit and past behaviour).\nAlthough these constructs may increase the predictive\nutility of the model, they do not address the TPB\u2019s focus\non a single GDB segregated from other concurrently\npursued GDBs.\nClinical practice often involves health professionals\nperforming numerous GDBs, each competing for limited\nresources in patient consultations, in particular time-\nrelated resources [13]. GDBs might conflict with (i.e.,\nhinder) pursuing a particular GDB while other GDBs\nmight create opportunities and be perceived to facilitate\n(i.e., help). Assessing perceptions about how conflicting\nand facilitating GDBs influence a focal GDB provides a\nway of accounting for the influence of the wider context\nof multiple goal pursuit which often characterises clini-\ncal practice. General medical practitioners perceive\nmany of their GDBs as facilitating and conflicting with\nguideline-recommended GDBs such as prescribing to\nreduce blood pressure and providing PA-related advice.\nFor example, GPs have reported that addressing the\npatient\u2019s agenda, treating acute illnesses, and prescribing\nto reduce cholesterol are among the GDBs perceived to\nconflict with giving PA advice [13]. Furthermore, taking\na patient\u2019s history, addressing alcohol consumption and\nsmoking, checking body mass index, and addressing\nwell-being and stress are perceived by GPs to facilitate\ngiving PA advice [13]. Thus, not only do health profes-\nsionals engage in numerous behaviours, but many of\nthese are also perceived as facilitating or conflicting.\nIt is not clear whether goal facilitation or goal conflict\nactually predict health professionals\u2019 behaviour beyond\nthe predictive efficacy of leading social cognition models\nsuch as the TPB. However, evidence from other popula-\ntions supports the potential of goal conflict and goal\nfacilitation as predictors of health professional behaviour.\nIn other professional contexts, both goal facilitation\nand goal conflict have been shown to be associated with\nbehaviour. In a management setting, goal conflict was\nnegatively associated (medium effect size [14]) with\nattainment of a novel self-set goal four months later\n[15]. However, goal conflict was assessed on a bipolar\nscale ranging from instrumental (negative values) to\nconflicting (positive values) and the observed mean of\n\u2018goal conflict\u2019 was negative and within a range that\nwould be considered as goal facilitation. The observed\nassociation may be more appropriately characterised as\nevidence of the relationship between goal facilitation\nand behaviour. In an academic context, university pro-\nfessors\u2019 conflict between teaching and research nega-\ntively predicted their research performance [16]. In a\ncontext of medical equipment sales, goal conflict was\nnegatively associated with commitment and self-efficacy\n(conceptually similar constructs to intention and PBC in\nthe TPB), and performance [17].\nThe relationship between goal facilitation and conflict\nand behaviour has also been investigated to further\nunderstand preventive health behaviour, such as partici-\npation in PA. Prospective studies predicting engagement\nin PA have demonstrated that goal facilitation, but not\ngoal conflict, predicts PA beyond TPB constructs\n[18-20].\nGoal conflict may be more readily perceived and pre-\ndictive of behaviour when the conflicting GDBs under\nPresseau et al. Implementation Science 2011, 6:73\nhttp:\/\/www.implementationscience.com\/content\/6\/1\/73\nPage 2 of 9\nconsideration are pursued within the same context as a\nfocal GDB. Focusing on goal conflict perceived within a\nresource-constrained clinical setting may be a more\nappropriate test of the predictive utility of this goal con-\nstruct. As such, the present study was interested in con-\nflict and facilitation between a health professional\u2019s\nGDBs. We aimed to explore the predictive utility of goal\nfacilitation and goal conflict in a health professional\ncontext. We hypothesised that goal facilitation and goal\nconflict would predict health professional behaviour\nover and above intention and PBC.\nMethods\nParticipants\nTo our knowledge, the present study was the first to test\ngoal conflict and goal facilitation as predictors of health\nprofessional behaviour in primary care. There was little\nexisting evidence upon which to estimate the effect sizes\nfor a formal power calculation, and thus this study was\nconsidered to be exploratory. We sent questionnaires to\na random sample of health professionals from all 84 GP\npractices in NHS Grampian and all 69 practices in NHS\nTayside, Scotland at baseline, targeting a final sample\nsize of at least 157 health professionals. We estimated a\n40% response at baseline and a 65% response at follow-\nup. Baseline questionnaires were sent to 606 health pro-\nfessionals (453 general practitioners, or GPs, and 153\nnurses).\nMeasures and data collection procedures\nThe focal goal-directed behaviour of interest in the cur-\nrent study concerned providing PA advice, a guideline-\nrecommended behaviour [3]. Patients with hypertension\nhave an elevated risk of cardiovascular disease, and\nincreased PA is associated with a reduction in blood\npressure [21]. The focal behaviour was specified as giv-\ning patients with an existing diagnosis of uncomplicated\nhypertension lifestyle advice for increasing their PA.\nAt baseline in March 2009, participants were sent a\nfour-page postal questionnaire along with an invitation\nletter, an information sheet, an informed consent sheet,\nand a freepost return envelope. An identical follow-up\nquestionnaire was sent to baseline respondents six\nmonths later, in October 2009 along with an invitation\nletter and follow-up reminders to non-respondents. This\nlength of follow-up is consistent with previous research\ntesting goal conflict and goal facilitation in other settings\n[18,19] and tests of the TPB in this population [22,23].\nTheory of planned behaviour\nTPB constructs were measured at baseline using single\nitems (to maximise response rates) in a single block pre-\nfaced with \u2018Please rate the following statements based on\nthe following action: In the next two weeks, personally\ngiving lifestyle advice for increasing physical activity to\nyour patients with an existing diagnosis of uncompli-\ncated hypertension.\u2019 Intention was measured with one\nitem: \u2018I intend to do this\u2019 (1-strongly disagree to 7-\nstrongly agree). PBC was measured with one item using\na semantic differential scale: \u2018For me, doing this is...\u2019 (1-\nvery difficult to 7- very easy). Attitude was also mea-\nsured on a single semantic differential scale: \u2018For me to\ndo this is...\u2019 (1-very bad practice to 7- very good prac-\ntice). Subjective norm was assessed using one item:\n\u2018People whose opinion I value expect me to do this\u2019 (1-\nstrongly disagree to 7-strongly agree).\nGoal facilitation and goal conflict\nMeasures for goal facilitation and goal conflict were\nadapted from existing scales [18,19] into two single\nitems (to maximise response rates) and assessed at base-\nline. For goal facilitation, participants were asked to rate\ntheir agreement with the statement \u2018During these con-\nsultations, other things I do helpfully lead me to give\nlifestyle advice for increasing physical activity\u2019 on a scale\nranging from 1-strongly disagree to 7-strongly agree. To\nmeasure goal conflict, participants were asked to indi-\ncate their agreement with the statement \u2018During these\nconsultations, other things I do lead me to spend less\ntime giving lifestyle advice for increasing physical activ-\nity\u2019 on a scale ranging from 1-strongly disagree to 7-\nstrongly agree. Factor analytic and predictive evidence\nhas shown that goal conflict and goal facilitation are\nbest considered as independent constructs, and were\ntherefore measured separately [18,19].\nDemographics\nParticipants were asked a series of demographic ques-\ntions to assess their age, sex, graduation year, employ-\nment status (full-time or part-time) and role (GP or\npractice nurse).\nBehaviour\nThe behavioural outcome measure was administered at\nfollow-up and consisted of two items. The first item asked\nparticipants \u2018How many patients with an existing diagnosis\nof uncomplicated hypertension have you personally seen\nin the past two weeks?\u2019 The second item asked \u2018and of\nthose, for how many did you give lifestyle advice for\nincreasing physical activity?\u2019 The outcome measure was\ncomputed as the proportion of patients to whom advice\nwas provided, out of the patients with existing uncompli-\ncated hypertension seen in the past two weeks.\nEthics approval\nEthical approval for the current study was obtained from\nthe North of Scotland Research Ethics Committee (REC\nNo. 09\/S0801\/4).\nPresseau et al. Implementation Science 2011, 6:73\nhttp:\/\/www.implementationscience.com\/content\/6\/1\/73\nPage 3 of 9\nResults\nParticipants\nSixty-nine of the 606 questionnaires sent at baseline\nwere returned (11.4%), 53 of which were completed at\nfollow-up (76.8%). At least one health professional\nfrom 57 of the 153 practices that were sent question-\nnaires at baseline responded (37.3%). Eight respon-\ndents were deleted list-wise for not having seen any\npatients with an existing diagnosis of hypertension in\nthe past two weeks at baseline or follow-up. One par-\nticipant was deleted list-wise due to missing data on\npredictor variables. The final sample comprised 44\nprimary care health professionals (37 GPs, 7 nurses)\nfrom 40 general practices. The cumulative response\nrate for the study was 7.3%. All nurses in the final\nsample were women, while 43% (16) of responding\nGPs were women. The population of GPs in NHS\nGrampian and Tayside from which participants were\nsampled was composed of a higher percentage of\nwomen (48%), indicating that the sample was slightly\noverrepresented by male GPs. Demographics are pre-\nsented in Table 1.\nDrop-out analysis\nParticipants included in the final analysis were com-\npared to those who did not respond to follow-up or\nwere excluded. Participants did not differ significantly\non any demographic variables or baseline predictor vari-\nables, except on attitude scores. Included participants\n(M = 5.64, SD = 1.20) had significantly (p = 0.007)\nlower attitude scores than those who were excluded (M\n= 6.33, SD = 0.80).\nDescriptive statistics and bivariate relations\nMean scores on intention, PBC, attitude, subjective\nnorm, and goal facilitation were moderately positive. For\ngoal conflict, some participants agreed that other GDBs\nthey performed conflict with giving PA advice while\nothers disagreed. Descriptive statistics and bivariate cor-\nrelations between key study variables are presented in\nTable 1. Supporting TPB hypotheses, attitude, subjective\nnorm, and PBC had medium-to-large correlations with\nintention [14]. Intention, attitude, goal facilitation, and\ngoal conflict most strongly correlated with behaviour.\nGoal facilitation, but not goal conflict, was significantly\ncorrelated with intention. Goal facilitation and conflict\nwere not significantly correlated with each other. Occu-\npation was also strongly correlated with behaviour (with\nnurses more likely to give advice than GPs), supporting\nthe idea of including occupation as a covariate in subse-\nquent analyses.\nGoal conflict and goal facilitation as predictors of clinical\nbehaviour\nA hierarchical linear regression was conducted to test the\nhypothesis that goal facilitation and goal conflict predict\nhealth professional behaviour above and beyond inten-\ntion and PBC. Intention, PBC, and occupation were\nentered at step one, and accounted for 47.7% of the var-\niance in behaviour. As shown in Table 2, goal facilitation\nwas entered at step two, and accounted for an additional\n5.8% of the variance in behaviour (p = 0.034). Goal con-\nflict was then entered in step three of the model, and\naccounted for an additional 8.4% of the variance in beha-\nviour (p = 0.006). The final model showed that intention,\nTable 1 Correlations and descriptives of behaviour, social cognitions, goal facilitation and goal conflict (n = 44)\nVariables 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 Mean SD\n1.

Controlling for occu-\npation, the predictors accounted for 46.0% of the var-\niance in intention, with attitude (b = 0.45, p = 0.005)\nand perceived behavioural control (b = 0.33, p = 0.036)\nas significant predictors, thereby supporting the TPB\nhypothesis.\nDiscussion\nMain findings\nThis exploratory study demonstrated the utility of goal\nfacilitation and goal conflict for predicting the reported\nprovision of PA advice by primary care health profes-\nsionals, beyond intention and PBC from the TPB. Social\ncognition models and other theories applied in imple-\nmentation science tend to focus on a single behaviour\nin isolation from the other behaviours performed in a\ngiven context. The present study presents a novel theo-\nretical approach to understanding health professional\nbehaviour. The novelty of this approach lies in the expli-\ncit consideration for the alternative behaviours that\nhealth professionals engage in and how these are per-\nceived to facilitate and conflict with a particular clinical\nbehaviour. The present study, while exploratory, shows\nthat other clinical behaviours are perceived to help or\nhinder a given health professional behaviour and that\nsuch perceptions predict the reported provision of PA\nadvice beyond PA advice-specific intention and PBC.\nThe potential of this approach is supported by testing\nthe predictive utility of novel constructs against evi-\ndenced theory-based predictors of behaviour (such as\nthose in the TPB). Given the preponderance of theories\nand theoretical constructs in the literature, the utility of\nnovel constructs for predicting behaviour should be\ntested against existing theory [24]. Such tests promote\ntheory development and move towards identifying a par-\nsimonious set of constructs which each contribute inde-\npendently to the prediction of behaviour.\nThe present study appears to be the first prospective\nstudy using and extending the TPB to predict the provi-\nsion of PA advice by health professionals in primary\ncare. It is also among the few which prospectively mea-\nsures health professional behaviour, and thus heeds cur-\nrent calls from the literature for such longitudinal\ndesigns [10]. Despite relatively strong intention and PBC\nover giving PA advice, health professionals who per-\nceived their competing GDBs as helpful and not hinder-\ning reported giving PA advice to more patients. The\nfindings extend the existing evidence base for the utility\nof goal facilitation and goal conflict beyond motivational\nvariables such as intention and PBC.\nPredicting health professional behaviour from goal\nfacilitation and goal conflict\nThe significant effects of goal facilitation and goal con-\nflict on behaviour beyond intention and PBC were\nequivalent in magnitude to intention\u2019s effect on beha-\nviour. GDBs perceived to help and hinder providing PA\nadvice thus aid in predicting how many patients will be\ngiven PA advice to the same extent as a health profes-\nsional\u2019s intention to do so. This finding highlights the\nimportance of considering the wider context of multiple\ngoal pursuit in clinical practice. A core assumption in\nthe TPB is that constructs in the theory sufficiently\naccount for all effects on behaviour [25]. While this\nassumption argues for the necessity of including factors\nsuch as intention and perceived control when predicting\nbehaviour, the present study suggests that these factors\nmay be necessary but not sufficient.\nThe lack of association between goal conflict and goal\nfacilitation themselves further supports the evidence sug-\ngesting that goal conflict and facilitation are distinct con-\nstructs that predict behaviour in different ways. Also,\nwhile associated to PBC, goal conflict and goal facilitation\npredicted behaviour over and above PBC, lending sup-\nport to the notion that control constructs in the TPB do\nnot sufficiently capture barriers and facilitators [13].\nThe current study replicates previous findings in the\nliterature that goal facilitation predicts behaviour over\nTable 2 Goal conflict, goal facilitation, intention,\nperceived behavioural control, and occupation as\npredictors of providing physical activity advice\nStep Predictor R2 \u0394R2 b B SE p 95% CI B\nCoefficient\nLower Upper\n1 0.48 <0.01\nIntention 0.36 0.09 0.03 0.01 0.02 0.15\nPBC1 0.05 0.01 0.04 0.73 -0.06 0.09\nOccupation 0.49 0.48 0.12 <0.01 0.25 0.72\n2 0.54 0.06 0.03\nIntention 0.26 0.06 0.03 0.07 -0.004 0.13\nPBC1 -0.05 -0.01 0.04 0.73 -0.09 0.06\nOccupation 0.47 0.47 0.11 <0.01 0.24 0.70\nGoal Facilitation 0.30 0.10 0.05 0.03 0.01 0.19\n3 0.62 0.08 <0.01\nIntention 0.28 0.07 0.03 0.03 0.01 0.13\nPBC1 -0.15 -0.04 0.04 0.25 -0.11 0.03\nOccupation 0.43 0.43 0.10 <0.01 0.22 0.64\nGoal Facilitation 0.28 0.09 0.04 0.03 0.01 0.18\nGoal Conflict -0.31 -0.07 0.02 <0.01 -0.12 -0.02\nNote.

The replica-\ntion of this finding in a different population, context,\nand behaviour further supports the utility of goal facili-\ntation as a predictive construct of behaviour above and\nbeyond the TPB. That goal conflict predicts behaviour\nover and above intention and PBC differs from other\nstudies that did not find goal conflict to predict preven-\ntive health-related behaviour [18-20]. The present study\nwas explicitly conducted within a population whose pur-\nsuit of multiple goals is characteristically time-con-\nstrained, which may explain the difference in results\ncompared to the aforementioned studies. Goal conflict\nmay be more readily perceived in such contexts than in\nstudies that ask participants about the goal conflict they\nperceive across the scope of their everyday life. This\nidea is supported by the observation that goal conflict\nresults in the present study are consistent with those\nfrom studies in other constrained contexts [16,17].\nThese findings may help to bring some clarity to the\nequivocal nature of the evidence supporting goal con-\nflict\u2019s role in predicting behaviour.\nConstraining the context of multiple goal pursuit may\nhave led to increased opportunity for GDBs to influence\none another and thus be perceived as facilitating and\nconflicting with giving PA advice. Furthermore, the sim-\nplified measures of goal facilitation and goal conflict,\ncompared to more elaborate cross-impact matrices pre-\nviously used [19], may have contributed to larger effect\nsizes.\nMean levels of perceived conflict were moderate in the\ncurrent study, suggesting that health professionals per-\nceived that the negative influence of their competing\nGDBs, while present, was not particularly strong. This\nmay be an indication of health professionals\u2019 capacity to\neffectively self-regulate their multiple GDBs such that\ndespite resource constraints they manage to provide\nappropriate advice to some patients. However, the nega-\ntive relationship between goal conflict and behaviour\nrather suggests that the more that participants perceived\ntheir competing GDBs as taking time away from giving\nPA advice, the fewer patients received PA advice.\nImplications for theory and practice\nIn their review of the effectiveness of guidelines for\nchanging health professionals\u2019 behaviour, Grimshaw and\ncolleagues argued for the need for testing and develop-\ning theory [26]. This study heeds these authors\u2019 sugges-\ntions by taking an integration approach to theory\ndevelopment. Although the TPB is among the models\nwith the best predictive utility, its isolated focus on a\nsingle behaviour segregated from others has limited eco-\nlogical validity for understanding behaviour in contexts\nwhere other GDBs are also performed. Although\nparsimonious, the TPB\u2019s evidenced lack of sufficiency\nhas implications which extend beyond the predictive\naims of the current study. Health professionals often\nreport strong intention, perceived behavioural control,\npositive attitude, and a strong normative influence\n[27,28], and yet gaps between evidence and practice per-\nsist. Identifying additional predictors of behaviour\nbeyond those in the TPB that are amenable to change\nmay supplement efforts directed towards implementing\nclinical practice guidelines. This exploratory study\ndemonstrates that goal conflict and facilitation can be\nsuch factors while also addressing limitations to the\nmodel. The present study suggests that further consid-\neration should be given to how the existing GDBs being\nperformed by health professionals might influence the\nperformance of guideline-recommended behaviours\nbeing implemented. Future research is needed to test\nwhether methods of optimising goal relationships\u2013such\nas planning, shielding, and deferring the pursuit of other\ngoals [29]\u2013can change behaviour. However, the current\nstudy also highlights a point ignored by single-behaviour\napproaches: changing an existing behaviour, or introdu-\ncing a new behaviour, may be influenced by the existing\nsystem of goal pursuit. Predispositions towards pursuing\nexisting (potentially competing) goal-directed behaviours\nmay help or hinder whether a behaviour is integrated\ninto a goal system and pursued over time. Furthermore,\npromotion of a particular goal-directed behaviour may\nalso have consequences for the existing goal system.\nWhile this was not tested in the current study, future\nresearch should consider how a focal GDB is perceived\nto help or hinder health professionals\u2019 other GDBs.\nRecruitment challenges and the use of single item\nmeasures\nDespite a relatively small sample size, this study\ndetected statistically significant effects because their\nmagnitude was large. Although their confidence inter-\nvals may be wide, the effect sizes we found can help to\ninform sample size calculations for future research. Ide-\nally, evidence-based recommendations for increasing\nresponses rates should be used at all phases of data col-\nlection when feasible. We utilised many evidence-based\nmethods of promoting questionnaire completion at fol-\nlow-up, such as printing questionnaires in colour, send-\ning questionnaires using recorded delivery, using shorter\nquestionnaires, and including stamped return envelopes\n[30,31]. However, besides using short questionnaires,\npragmatic constraints limited our ability to use addi-\ntional techniques at baseline.\nSmall sample sizes are not uncharacteristic of theory-\nbased studies with health professionals. Of the 14 pro-\nspective studies testing the TPB in health professionals\nidentified by Godin et al.\u2019s [10] systematic review, seven\nPresseau et al. Implementation Science 2011, 6:73\nhttp:\/\/www.implementationscience.com\/content\/6\/1\/73\nPage 6 of 9\nhad sample sizes of 50 participants or less. Furthermore,\nmany of the reviewed studies using postal questionnaires\nto collect data reported response rates of less than 25%.\nThis underscores the recruitment challenges involved in\nconducting theory-based research with busy health pro-\nfessionals. These challenges are not new. Indeed, we\nexpected a degree of attrition, and this was among the\nprimary justifications for measuring constructs using\nsingle items. We kept the questionnaire short to pro-\nmote a higher response and to reduce participant\nburden.\nBy convention, TPB studies typically assess constructs\nusing multiple items and report an index of internal\nconsistency, but such operationalisations do not address\nissues of validity. Multi-item measures used to assess\nintention tend to vary a single word in each item, often\nusing words with similar but not identical meaning,\nassuming that they tap the same construct. While this\nmay promote a high Cronbach\u2019s alpha, some wording\nreflects measures of demonstrably distinct constructs\nand may be theoretically unjustifiable. For example, a\nprototypical intention item is worded: \u2018I intend to do \u00d7\nbehaviour in Y context at Z time.\u2019 However, additional\nitems using similar wording such as \u2018I want,\u2019 \u2018I expect,\u2019\nand \u2018I plan to\u2019 are commonly recommended intention\nitems, despite being arguably related to separate con-\nstructs: \u2018I want\u2019 measures desire [32], \u2018I expect\u2019 measures\nbehavioural expectation [33], and \u2018I plan to\u2019 can be\nviewed as a facet of a post-intentional planning measure\n[34]. The single item measures used in the present\nstudy allowed us to circumvent this issue.\nThe quality or presence of psychometric properties of\npredictors of health professional behaviour does not\nappear to be an effect modifier of the magnitude of the\nrelationship between predictors and behaviour [10].\nScores on single items measures may be associated with\nbehaviour to a similar magnitude as scores from multi-\nitem measures, as we observed.\nThe present study was exploratory and serves to\ndemonstrate that, given the consistently observed good\npsychometric properties of standard items across\nnumerous studies, single items might be considered as\nan alternative to multi-item measures. Observed means\nand standard deviations from single items were consis-\ntent with other studies using composite scores based on\nmultiple items [27,35]. In addition, the amount of var-\niance in intention and behaviour accounted for (46%\nand 48%) was in line with mean frequency-weighted R2\nobserved across TPB studies reported by Godin et al.\u2019s\nreview [10] (59% and 35%, respectively). Despite the lim-\nitations of single item measures, this study shows that\nscores based on such items can be effectively used in\nmultiple regression-based analyses, and means, standard\ndeviations, and effect sizes are similar to those garnered\nfrom composite scores based on multi-item scales.\nLimitations and future research\nThe measure of behaviour involved a two-week retro-\nspective self-report, assessed six months after baseline.\nThe two-week time period was selected to maximise the\nopportunity that health professionals would have seen\npatients, and thus had the opportunity to give them PA\nadvice while providing a reasonable length of time for\nrecalling such behaviour. While the self-reported beha-\nviour was subject to recall bias, such measures can often\nbe worded to more closely correspond to the predictive\nfactors under study than objective measures of health\nprofessional behaviour [36]. Future research is neverthe-\nless required using objective measures of behaviour with\nstrong correspondence to measures of the predictive\nconstructs. However, objective measures of provision of\nPA advice would require health professionals to reliably\ncode the provision of advice in medical records, which\nmay itself be influenced by the degree of competing\ngoals vying for time. The exploratory nature of the pre-\nsent study provides an argument for a need for replica-\ntion in other settings and health professional behaviours.\nWhile the sample was randomly selected, the observed\nlow response rate suggests that respondents might be a\nself-selected group. It may be the case that the sampled\nhealth professionals were those with sufficiently low\ngoal conflict to have time to complete the questionnaire,\nwhile the non-respondents had higher goal conflict,\nwhich may have contributed to their non-response. This\nfurther underscores the relevance of goal conflict.\nFuture research should aim to maximise response rates\nusing evidenced methods [30] and assess the generalisa-\nbility of the sample against population demographic\nvariables besides those reported in the present study (i.\ne., sex).\nAlthough single item measures move away from idio-\nsyncratic measurement options taken in other studies\n[15,18,19], such measures may have simplified the typi-\ncally more elaborate assessment of goal conflict and\ngoal facilitation.\nIt is not clear to what extent goal conflict and facilita-\ntion vary over time in health professionals. Future\nresearch could consider whether the stability of goal\nconflict and facilitation might moderate the relationship\nbetween these factors and behaviour.\nFinally, cross-sectional and prospective analyses pre-\nclude causal links from being tested. On the basis of the\npredictive evidence in support of goal facilitation and\ngoal conflict, future research should test whether target-\ning these constructs for change in an intervention leads\nto behaviour change.\nPresseau et al.
