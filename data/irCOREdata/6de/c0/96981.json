We have published 140\narticles online, which is over twice the publication rate of the previous year. This\nreflects the increase in the submission rates and Springer\u2019s view that papers should\nbe published online as quickly as possible. In addition, the entire archive of the\nBulletin of Mathematical Biology is now available on the Springer website for the\njournal, digitized back to Vol. 1, No. 1, published in 1939.\nYou will, no doubt, be aware that the transition from Elsevier to Springer\ncaused a delay in processing papers and understandable frustration for authors\n(and Editor). We apologise for that. However, you will also have noticed that\nthe past few issues of the journal have been extremely large (including a couple\nof bumper issues at the end of the year) indicating that we are getting rid of the\nbacklog and are now on track again. An indication of this is that there are now,\non average, 6700 articles downloaded a month from the BMB!\nIn an editorial of January 2006, it was mentioned that to honour the enormous\ncontribution that Lee Segel made to the BMB and the field of mathematical biol-\nogy as a whole, Springer, in partnership with the Society of Mathematical Biology,\nis funding a series of prizes. We now have the details of these.\nThere will be a prize of 5,000 dollars for the best original research paper pub-\nlished (awarded every 2 years), a prize of 3,000 dollars for the best student research\npaper (awarded every 2 years), and a prize of 4,000 dollars for the best review pa-\nper (awarded every 3 years). It is therefore important when a paper is submitted\nthat the authors indicate if the first author is a student. We would also like referees\nto indicate if they feel that a paper they are reviewing should be considered for a\nprize.\nA committee appointed by the SMB Board of Directors and the Editor-in-Chief\nwill be set up to judge and award prizes, taking on board advice of referees and\nreferee reports. All articles accepted from January 2006 will be considered. The\nfirst winners of the best original paper and best student paper will be announced at\nthe SMB meeting in 2008. The winner of the best review paper will be announced\nat the SMB meeting in 2009.\nIt is perhaps also a good time to announce that coming soon to \u201ca computer\nscreen near you\u201d is Editorial Manager, Springer\u2019s online submission and peer re-\nview tool. This should be in operation early in 2007 so please consult the webpage\nwww.springer.com\/11538 for forthcoming information.\nPhilip K. Maini\nMark Chaplain\nAchi Dosanjh\n"}
