These phenomena\nare demonstrated in the numerical solution of a particular reaction-diffusion\nsystem, and finally a possible application of the results to pattern formation in\nDrosophila larvae is discussed.\n1. Introduction\nDiffusion driven instability was first proposed as a mechanism of developmental\npattern formation by Turing (1952). In this mechanism reacting and diffusing\nchemicals (morphogens) form a pattern which controls subsequent cell\ndifferentiation. Subsequent research has led to a detailed understanding of the\nmechanism and its applications (see Murray, 1989, and Meinhardt, 1982, for a\nreview) and many variants have been studied (e.g. Benson et al, 1993; Dillon et\nal. 1994). However, one feature common to all variants is that the prepattern of\nthe different morphogens is either in phase or wholly out of phase. This limits the\napplicability of diffusion-driven instability: in particular Russell (1985) has shown\nthat a chemical prepattern in which the morphogens have inexact phase\ndifferences could be used to explain metamerism (segmentation) and its mutant\nvariants in the Drosophila larva. In this paper we discuss reaction-diffusion-\nadvection systems as possible candidates for the generation of chemical waves\nwith inexact phase differences.\nt Present address: Nonlinear Systems Laboratory, Mathematics Institute, University of Warwick,\nCoventry CV4 7AZ.\n19\nO Oxford Urirenity Pren 1993\n2 0 A.

Derivation of the model\nConsider a system of reacting morphogens, say u = (uuu2,. \u2022., un), each of\nwhich exhibits advection in addition to diffusing through the surrounding\nmedium. In order to describe their behaviour, a continuum approach using\ndensity functions to describe the distribution of the basic particles is typically\nused. For the ith chemical morphogen we define u,(x, t) as the concentration,\nQi(x, t) as the net creation rate of particles, and Jt(x, t) as the flux density in the\nregion Q. The conservation equations for these chemicals have the form\nf'\u2014v-y + G. (i)\nIn our model we assume \/, = -d^ut + atuh where a, and dt are constants. This\nimplies that the flux depends both on the concentration (advection) and the\ngradient (diffusion). Hence we have the system of equations for the n\nmorphogens of the form\nu, = D \u2022 V2\u00ab + V(a \u2022 u) + \/(\u00ab). (2)\nWe consider for simplicity the case of two interacting morphogens u and v, in one\nspace dimension, so that\ndt ~ ^ ( \"'\ndv\ndt\ndu\n>V) + adx +\n. ,dv\nD \u2014\n\" dx1\nD ^vdx2\nfor 0 < x < l . Here y is a scale parameter, resulting from the rescaling of the\ndomain. We assume that the kinetics \/and g are such that there is a homogeneous\nsteady state, (u0, v0) say. For algebraic simplicity, we will in future write p =a + b\nand q=a-b.\nWe now consider the most appropriate boundary conditions for (3) and (4).\nMost reaction-diffusion models for pattern formation have used zero-flux\nboundary conditions mainly because the interest is in self-organization of pattern,\nand zero flux implies no external input. However, it would be artificial to study\nphase differences with either zero flux or Dirichlet boundary conditions, since\nthese impose a phase difference on any solution, at least near the boundaries. In\nfact, in the context of developmental biology we are in most cases studying a\ndomain which is much larger than the size of the pattern, since the pattern is\nlocalized to one part of the embryo. In such cases, we do not expect the\nboundary conditions to have any significant bearing on the pattern formed. Hence\nthe pattern we are studying should be driven by the equations and not by the\nboundary conditions. In some contexts it is appropriate to consider an infinite\ndomain, but in others the restrictions on pattern imposed by a finite domain size\nare crucial, and in such cases periodic boundary conditions represent a convenient\nway of studying patterning excluding effects from the boundary, except the\nPHASE DIFFERENCES IN MORPHOGENESIS 21\nconstraint of discrete mode numbers. Periodic boundary conditions correspond to\nclosed domains and were in fact used by Turing (1952) in his original paper. The\nconditions are\n\u00ab(0) = u(l), \u00ab'(0) = u'(l), (5)\nv(0) = v(l),\n W'(O) = !\/'(!)\u2022 (6)\nThe ensuing analysis is equally valid for an infinite domain; the imposition of (5)\nand (6) corresponds to mode selection, which will be discussed in detail later.\nThe homogeneous steady state (u0) v0) is the positive solution of\nf(u,v) = 0, g(u,v) = O. (7)\nWe are looking for instability that is prompted by the spatial spread of the\nmorphogen, and hence we require the steady state to be linearly stable to\nspatially homogeneous perturbations, for which the conditions are\nfu+gv<0, (8)\n(9)\n(see e.g. Murray, 1989). These impose certain constraints on the kinetic\nparameters. Now we consider the full reaction-diffusion-advection system and\nlinearize about the homogeneous steady state, giving\nw, = yAw+ Bwx + Dw^, (10)\nwhere\n\\a 01 Tl 0\"|B\n\"io A H o A\nand w is the vector of perturbations from the steady state. We look for solutions\nof the form\nw = WcfiMW(x). (11)\nSince we are considering either an infinite domain or a finite domain with periodic\nboundary conditions, any solution of the linear equation (10) can be written as a\nsum of sinusoidal solutions of the form\nW(x) = c ^ + c2e- to. (12)\nThe linearized equation determines a growth rate A corresponding to each\nadmissible wavenumber k. The steady state will be unstable to suitable perturba-\ntions if any of these growth rates are positive, while if all are negative the steady\nstate will be stable. The inherent stochasticity in all biological systems means that\nin applications all wavenumbers will be present in perturbations. It is noteworthy\nthat other approaches have been used in the past for studying the stability\nproperties of solutions to reaction-diffusion equations. For example, Casten &\nHolland (1977) have described a method to determine the local asymptotic\nstability of a nonlinear reaction-diffusion system with zero Neumann boundary\n2 2 A. J. PERUMPANANI ET AL.\nconditions based on the eigenvalues of a matrix arising from the linearization of\nthe system of equations.\n3. Conditions for dispersion driven instability\nSubstituting (11) into (3) and (4) gives\n\\uo = -k2uo + aikuo + y(fuuo+fvvo), (13)\nAv0 = -dkhjQ + bikv0 + y{guuQ + gvv0). (14)\nThis has a nontrivial solution if and only if\ndet\\\\I-yA~Bik + Dk2\\=O. (15)\nThis equation is the dispersion relation, determining the growth rate A as a\nfunction of the wavenumber k. Expanding it gives\nA2 + A[*2(l + d)- \\k(a + b)- y(Ju + gv)) + h{k) = 0, (16)\nwhere\nh(k) = dk< - \\k\\ad + b)- k2[y(dfu + gv) + ab] + iky(agv + bfu) + y 2 C U , -fvgu).\n(17)\nThe roots of (16) are given by\n2A\u00b1 = - ( a + i\/3) \u00b1 [(a + i0)2 - 4<o- + iw)]K (18)\nwhere\na = k2(l + d)-y(Ju+gv),\na=dk<- k2[y(gv + dfu) + \\{p2 - q2)] + y 2 ^ - fvgu),\nw = -\\k\\p{d + 1) + q(d - 1)] + \\ky[{p + q)gv + (p - q)fu\\\nWe may rewrite the solutions (18) in the form\n[][^W] (20)\nwhere\ni, (21)\n2af} - 4<o\n( 2 2 )\nThe steady state (u0, v0) is linearly stable if Re [A] < 0 for all wavenumbers k. The\nconditions for the steady state to be stable in the absence of spatial effects, i.e.\nRe [\\(k = 0)] < 0, are given by (8) and (9). Given these conditions, the system\nwill become unstable to suitable spatially varying disturbances if\nPHASE DIFFERENCES IN MORPHOGENESIS 23\nd[ks\nRe [A(fc)] > 0 for some k > 0. These solutions will occur only if k represents an\nadmissible mode, and the implication of this will be discussed in full in a later\nsection. By manipulating (19) using a computer algebra package, it can be shown\nthat if instability does occur for a given (admissible) k then the bifurcation will\noccur along the line Re (A) = 0, that is\nd3[k8-yfuk6] +\nd2[2ke + y2k\\2fl-fvgu + 3 \/^) - yk'(4fu + 3gv)] +\nf&irfl + 2fufvgu - 4flgv + lUugv - 3\/^5) +\n- 2fvgu + 8 \/ ^ + 3gl) - yk\\+3fu + Agv +fuq2) + k6q3] +\njVu + gv)2(.\\A\\) + y3k2(fu + gv)(2fugu - 3 \/ ^ - gl) +\ny 2 * 4 ^! + 2gv(fu + gv)] - y(gvk6) + q2igvk2y)(Juy - k2) = 0. (23)\nThis is independent of p and can be solved explicitly for q giving q2 = Q(d; k).\nWe have illustrated this curve in Fig. 1. This gives rise to the third condition for\ndispersion driven instability, i.e.\nq2>Q{d;k), (24)\nfor any admissible k. In (8) and (9) we have established the conditions for the\nhomogeneous steady state to be stable. If \/\u201e + gv < 0 then either or both of fu and\ngv is negative. If both fu and ^ are negative then (23) implies that Q(d; k)<0 for\nall d,k2 > 0. Thus fu and gv must have different signs and we assume without loss\nof generality that fu > 0.\nThere is a critical curve q2 = Q(d;k) dividing stability and instability. If\nFIG. 1. An example of the curve Q(d;k) for which (BQ\/dd)(0;k)>0. Here we are considering a\nmode 2 solution. Here and in future numerical simulations we use the Schnakenberg (1979) system\nwhich is a simple kinetic mechanism of the cross activator-inhibitor type. It can be nondimensional-\nized to two parameters and is hence convenient to study numerically. In this simulation we have used\nthe Schnakenberg kinetics as defined in (33) and (34) with A - 0-2 and B = 2-0. The scale factor y is\ntaken as 450.\n2 4 A. i. PERUMPANANI ET AL.\nk2> yfu, then direct substitution into (23) shows that Q(d\\k)<0 for any d>0.\nHence Q(d;k) lies below the d axis whenever k2>yfu, and all unstable\nwavenumbers satisfy k2 < yfu.\nThis then implies that the need for autocatalysis and the maximum wavenum-\nber are independent of the presence of advection. We can now use the\ninequalities (8) and (9) to establish the configurational requirements on the\nstability matrix. As in the standard case of reaction-diffusion equations without\nadvection there are only two configurations that can satisfy (8) and (9) with fu and\ngi, having opposite signs, namely\nhas the sign structure I _ or I.\n3.1 Diffusional requirements\nThe next issue relates to the ratio of the two diffusion coefficients d = Du\/Dv. In\nthe absence of advection there is a critical diffusion coefficient ratio d = dc at\nwhich the Turing bifurcation occurs. For all values of d below dc the system is\nstable to small perturbations while for d > dc suitable perturbations grow in time.\nHere dc is given as the unique root greater than 1 of the quadratic\ndlfl + 2(2fvgu - fejdc + gl = 0 (25)\n(see Murray, 1989). However, in the presence of advection, the corresponding\nbifurcation occurs as q2 increases through q2 = Q(d;k). In some cases Q(d;k)\nincreases for small d before decreasing to zero for d = dc. This implies two\nregions of instability with an intervening interval of stability as d is increased for\nfixed q. The derivative of Q(d; k) at d = 0 is given by\nZA = ,J~ \\*s W2 ~ yf\"X2gl+fvgu) + yfvgugJ\\. (26)\nda\n d-0 gv(k -yfu)\nRecalling that k2<yfu along with the kinetic constraints, this implies that:\n(1) if 2g2v +fvgu < 0, then dQ\/dd is strictly positive;\n(2) if 2gl +fvgu > 0, then the derivative is negative for small wavenumbers and\npositive for large wavenumbers.\nA positive derivative for Q{d) implies that for particular values of q, namely\nq2 > Q(0; k), a monotonic increase in d will result in instability to perturbations\nwith that wavenumber for small and large d, with an interval of stability in\nbetween. Thus there are two Turing-type bifurcations as d is varied with q fixed.\nPHASE DIFFERENCES IN MORPHOGENESIS 25\n20\nReM)\n40\n-20\n-60\n-80\n-100\nFIG. 2. In the presence of advection for sufficiently large values of q, positive growth rates\n(Re (A) > 0) occur for very small and very large values of d with an intervening area of negative\ngrowth rates. In this figure we plot Re (A) against d as defined in equation (20). For the lower curve\nq = 200 and there is only one region of positive growth rates for large values of d. The upper curve\nhas q = 280 and shows separated areas of positive growth. In this simulation we have used the\nSchnakenberg kinetics as denned in (33) and (34) with A = 0-2 and B \u00ab 2-0. The scale factor y is taken\nas 450.\nIn Fig. 2, Re [A] is plotted against d for two different values of q with a particular\nset of kinetics, and for the larger value of q it is clear that there are two separate\nTuring bifurcations. Note that the maximum of Q{d\\ k) can easily be determined\nanalytically as the positive root of the quadratic dQ\/dd = 0.\n4. The form of spatial patterns\n4.1 The dispersion relation\nWe are considering solutions of the linearized system with\n(u,v)*eHk)t+lkx (27)\nand these will grow in time if and only if Re (A) > 0. On an infinite domain, the\ncondition A(A:)>0 for some k is sufficient for the existence of pattern; however,\non finite domains, the boundary conditions impose further restrictions. Only\ncertain modes which satisfy the boundary conditions can be accommodated, and if\nA (A:) is not positive for such a wavenumber then no pattern emerges. Our\nnotation henceforth is that a mode n solution has wavenumber k = 2iui.\n4.2 Initial mode selected\nThe curve q2 = Q(d; k), illustrated in Fig. 1, divides the q-d plane into stable and\nunstable regions for perturbations of a particular wavenumber k. In applications,\nhowever, our interest is in whether the steady state (u0, v0) is stable or unstable\nto a perturbation of any admissible wavenumber, on a given domain. The curve\ncorresponding to this in the q-d plane is q2 = Q*(d) = minn Q(d; k =2nn). A\n26 A. J. PERUMPANANI ET AL.\n= 175\n7.5x10*\nFIG. 3. A typical case illustrates that, for sufficiently large values of the space parameter y, the initial\nmode of bifurcation is not uniform. Here the domain size is much larger than that in Fig. 1 and we\nhave chosen the scale parameter y = 107. The three curves drawn from (23) represent the line of\nbifurcation into patterns with mode numbers mentioned alongside the curves. In this case the primary\nbifurcation is into different modes in different regions of the q-d plane.\nkey issue is whether Q*{d) consists simply of a single Q(d\\ 2roi) curve or whether\nit is composed of segments of different Q(d\\ 2nn) curves for different values of n.\nNumerical investigation shows that both cases occur and suggests that for small\ndomains the primary bifurcation curve has a single mode, but for large domains\nthe initial bifurcation is into patterns with different mode numbers at different\npoints in the q-d plane; we will confirm this analytically by considering the q = 0\nand d = 0 cases. Thus the primary bifurcation curve q2= Q*(d) is in general\ncomposed of portions of the curves q2= Q{d;lTin) for different values of n. In\nFig. 3 we show a numerical demonstration of a case in which this initial\nbifurcation curve is composed of three different modes.\nA convenient way to study the nonuniformity of the initial mode of bifurcation\nin large domains is by looking at the end points of the curve described in Fig. 1,\nthat is, the case q = 0 and d = 0.\n(a) Bifurcation when q = 0 The point at which the curve intersects the d axis is\nthe point at which the advective terms are the same or are absent. The system\nthen reduces to a standard reaction-diffusion system and the initial bifurcation\ninto instability is through the wavenumber satisfying the quadratic\ndk4 - yk\\dfu + gv) + y2 \\A | = 0 (28)\nand the initial mode selected at the primary bifurcation is given by the maximum\nof the above curve, which is\nk2 = dfu+gv\nId\n(29)\nWe have illustrated this mode selection for different domain sizes in Fig. 4.\nPHASE DIFFERENCES IN MORPHOGENESIS 27\n41.0 r -\n39.6\nFIG. 4. An illustration of the curve described in (28) for different values of the space parameter y.\nThis represents the prediction made by the linear theory for kllK, where k is the wavenumber of the\npattern when the advection terms are either absent or equal for the two morphogens. The kinetics\nused here are the Schnakenberg kinetics with A = 0-2 and B = 2-0.\n{b) Bifurcation when d = 0 Another point of interest on the curve given in\nFig. 1 is the point at which it intersects the q2 axis, d = 0. Physically this\nimplies a situation where the inhibitor does not diffuse or the activator has\na very large (effectively infinite) diffusion coefficient compared to the inhibitor.\nIn the absence of advection the inhibitor needs to diffuse faster than the\nactivator (short-range activation, long-range inhibition) for diffusion-driven\ninstability to occur. However, in the presence of advection, Turing-type bifurca-\ntions can occur even when d = 0, and from (23) the bifurcation at d = 0 is given\nby\n+ gv)H\\A\\) + y3k2(Ju + gv)(2fvgu - 3\/Lg, - gl)\n+ y2k\\\\A\\ + 2gv(Ju + gv)) ~ = 0. (30)\nNumerical investigation shows that for small domains the primary bifurcation on\nthe d = 0 and q2 = 0 curves occur for wavenumbers which, though different, are\nsufficiently close that the nearest admissible wavenumber is the same. However,\nas the domains become larger, the two wavenumbers move apart. Since we are\ndealing with a finite domain and the boundary conditions are periodic, the\nwavenumbers have to be discrete multiples of 2n. At a certain domain size they\nare more than 2JI apart and then the mode numbers of the initial bifurcation on\nthe two areas are no longer the same. We illustrate this mode selection for\ndifferent domain sizes in Figs 4 and 5.\n28 A. J. PERUMPANANI ET AL.\nFIG. 5. An illustration of the prediction made by the linear theory of Jfc\/2jt, where k is the\nwavenumber, when the inhibitor does not diffuse, i.e. d = 0. We plot the equation (30) for different\ndomain sizes. Depending on the choice of the domain size reflected in varying values of y, the initial\nmode selected varies. The kinetics are the Schnakenberg kinetics with A = 0-2 and B = 2-0.\n5. The nature of the advection terms\nIt emerges from the analysis that the parameters p and q (p = a + b, q = a \u2014 b)\nrepresent a convenient way to study the nature of the advective influence on the\nfeatures of the model. Both the phase difference and the growth rate (Re (A)) are\nindependent of the parameter p and depend only on q. However, Im (A) depends\non both p and q. In other words, the phase difference and growth of modes\ndepend only on the difference of the advective terms, but the temporal movement\nof the solution when a mode is unstable depends on both their sum and\ndifference.\nThe physical meaning of Im (A) 7s 0 is that the solutions are not stationary in\ntime. The whole pattern of morphogens moves with a uniform 'phase velocity'.\nSince the boundary conditions are periodic, a convenient way to visualize the\nsolution is as wrapped around a rotating cylinder. The period of rotation of the\ncylinder is given by 27t\/Im [A]. Now the parameter p simply corresponds to a\nrotation in the observer's frame of reference, and if this frame of reference is\nmoving with the same velocity as the angular velocity of the cylinder then the\nsolutions will appear to be stationary. As discussed earlier the phase difference <P\nand the growth rate Re (A) are independent of p but Im (A) depends on p. So, by\nan appropriate choice of p, we can induce a solution with any particular <t> and\nRe (A) to be stationary. Using (20) we can derive an analytical expression for a\n\/'critical such that when p ^Paitiai the solutions are stationary in time. This is given\nby\n1\n1 - - (31)\nwhere r and <j> are given in (21) and (22). Note that this critical value is different\nfor different modes.\nPHASE DIFFERENCES IN MORPHOGENESIS 29\n6. Phase differences\nThe fundamental new phenomenon resulting from the inclusion of advection is\nthat the patterns of the two morphogens are spatially out of phase. Since u and v\nare sinusoidal functions, we can write them in the form ^e'9! and r2ei9j.\nrespectively, and calculate the phase difference as 4> = d\u00b1 \u2014 62. <P can be\ndetermined analytically from (13) and (14) as\n= arctan\nf - a\nlk2- (32)\nHowever, we are using analysis on the linear system to make predictions about\nthe full nonlinear system. These predictions will be valid only close to the primary\nbifurcations where the effects of the nonlinearities are small. Using expression\n(23) we can determine q\\d) = Q(d; k) along the line Re (A) = 0, and it is along\nthis line in the q-d plane that we study the phase difference. It is straightforward\nto determine an analytical expression, albeit algebraically complicated, for the\nphase difference, and a typical case is illustrated in Fig. 6.\nWe have been unable to use the equation for the phase difference along the\nline Re (A) = 0 so as to determine the maximum phase difference that occurs.\nHowever, our numerical investigations suggest that the maximum phase\ndifference seems to occur at d = 0 and it is straightforward to determine an\nanalytical expression for this. This maximum phase difference depends on the\nkinetics and with the Schnakenberg kinetics the maximum is about 60\u00b0 for A = 0-2\nand B = 2-0.

PERUMPANANI ET AL.\nthe zero of <f(d) is large (though finite). This is significant in applications,\nmeaning that for small values of q appreciable phase differences are obtained.\n7. Numerical simulations\nWe numerically investigated equations (3) and (4) with kinetics proposed by\nSchnakenberg (1979). With appropriate nondimensionalization in one space\ndimension, the equations are\nu, = y{A - u + u2v) + aux + u^, (33)\nv, = y(B + uh)) + bvx + dv^, (34)\non 0 \u00ab x =\u00a3 1. Here y is the scale factor proportional to the squared length of the\ndomain and A,B,a,b,d are constants. We investigated the equations with\nboundary conditions (5) and (6) and with initial conditions being small perturba-\ntions about the steady state of the kinetics. We solved (33) and (34) using both an\nexplicit finite-difference scheme and an implicit theta scheme. For the explicit\nscheme we used the stability criteria for the diffusion equation, i.e. v =\ndAt\/(Ax)2 =\u00a3 0-5 (see Smith, 1985, for details), where Ax is the spatial grid size and\nAt the time step. When diffusion is predominant, values of v close to 0-5 were\nadequate. But as advection becomes predominant, smaller values of v are\nrequired, typically reaching 0-1 for d = 0. In Fig. 7 we demonstrate the spatial\ndistribution of u and v at different points along the tine of bifurcation in the q-d\nplane described in (23). A comparison of the analytically predicted phase\ndifference with that computed numerically showed a very close agreement. We\nwere able to confirm that by choosing p =\/Jcriticai as described in (31) the solutions\nare stationary in time. Moreover, we were able to demonstrate numerically the\noccurrence of a Turing-type bifurcation with d = 0 in (30) and the occurrence of\ntwo Turing-type bifurcations as described in the section on diffusional\nrequirements.\n8. Applications in morphogenesis\nRussell (1985) proposed a model to explain the segmentation pattern seen in\nDrosophila larvae. In his formulation of this model Russell has not attempted to\nsimulate the behaviour of any specific set of reaction-diffusion equations; rather\nhis discussion is abstract and he assumes chemical waves can be generated in the\norganism. Thus he supposes that the concentration of the two morphogens w and\nv vary independently along the embryonic axis in a sinusoidal manner. Specifi-\ncally he takes w = mi+ n^ sinx and v = m2 + n2 sin (x + <f>), where \\m\\ - m2\\ is\nthe difference in equilibrium and <}> the phase difference between the chemical\nwaves of the two morphogens. The relative concentration of the two morphogens\nmay be thought of as defining a quantity a that varies periodically as a function of\nx:\ni\n^T7jF- (35)\nPHASE DIFFERENCES IN MORPHOGENESIS 31\n-1.0\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8\nFIG. 7. The behaviour of the nonlinear system described in equations (3) and (4) along the line of\nbifurcation in the q-d plane, (a) The analytical prediction from the linear system of the bifurcation\ncurve as described in (23). We are looking for a mode 2 solution here which is the sole initial mode of\nbifurcation when the space parameter y \u2022= 450. In (b-f) we show the numerical solutions for the five\nsets of values marked in (a). In (b) the diffusion coefficient d = 40-3 and the difference of the\nadvection coefficients q = 0; in (c) d = 32-4, q = 232; in (d) d = 20-4, q = 322; in (e) d = 8-4, q = 320;\nand in (f) d \u2022= 0-0, q = 270. As is evident from (f) oscillatory solutions occur even when the inhibitor\ndoes not diffuse. Throughout we have used the Schnakenberg kinetics with A = 0-2 and B = 2-0.\nThis idea is illustrated in Fig. 8. In the wild type (i.e. normal larvae) the phase\ndifference is set to JI\/2 and m} = m2 = 0, n^ = n2 = 1. Morphological variations in\nthe Drosophila larva are very well documented (see Nusslein-Volhard &\nWieschaus, 1980, for a review). Segment polarity mutations and growth\ncontraction\/expansion are common variations. In the segment polarity mutants in\neach segment a defined fraction of the normal pattern is deleted and the\nremainder is present as a mirror image duplication. Russell (1985) proposes that\nthese variations can be explained on the basis of the patterning variable a, given\nchanges in the equilibrium and phase differences of the morphogen patterns (see\nFig. 8).\nWe suggest that with w = du\/dx and (a, b) = (0, 0) (33) and (34) can be used to\n32 A.
