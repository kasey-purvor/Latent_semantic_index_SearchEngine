A common assumption in these models, known as the market utility property,\nis that a single firm\u2019s offer does not affect the workers\u2019 overall expected utility. This property\nfacilitates equilibrium characterization because it allows firms to treat workers\u2019 expected utility\nparametrically; hence the moniker \u201ccompetitive search\u201d that is often given to this literature.\nA natural question is what are the foundations of the market utility property? The underlying\nidea is that a single agent\u2019s actions do not affect aggregate outcomes in a market with a large\nnumber of participants and therefore any strategic interactions can be ignored. Ideally, of course,\nthis is a property to be proved rather than assumed. The standard approach for doing so is to\nderive the equilibria of a finite economy, where strategic interactions are present and strategies\nand off-equilibrium payoffs are well-defined, in order to examine their limit as the number of\nagents becomes large. So far this analysis has been performed in very simple environments with\nrisk-neutral agents, no informational or incentive problems beyond matching frictions, fixed\nproductivity on the job and urn-ball matching (see Burdett, Shi and Wright (2001) for the case\nof homogeneous firms; see Peters (2000) for the case of heterogeneous firms).\nHowever, the applied literature has moved on to questions that require more complicated\nenvironments in order to be dealt with in a satisfactory way. Examples of such environments\ninclude introducing risk-averse workers (Acemoglu and Shimer (1999)), match-specific private\ninformation (Guerrieri (2008)), endogenous choice of the intensive margin (hours) of work (Faig\nand Jerez (2004), Rocheteau and Wright (2005), Berentsen, Menzio and Wright (2010)) and\nmoral hazard (Moen and Rozen (2007)). All of these papers use some version of the market\nutility property even though it has not been explicitly micro-founded in their environments.\nIn addition, the empirical predictions of the urn-ball matching function perform poorly when\n2\nconfronted with data (Petrongolo and Pissarides (2001)) and many authors have used more\ngeneral matching functions which allow for a more flexible relation between the labor market\ntightness and the number of matches. In sum, the directed search literature has moved ahead of\nits foundations in terms of both the production and the matching technology.\nThis paper\u2019s contribution is two-fold. First, we propose a unified framework with flexible\nproduction and matching specifications and show that it encompasses most of the existing di-\nrected search literature including all of the aforementioned papers. Second, we show that such\na framework retains sufficient tractability to analyze the finite economy where firms\u2019 strategic\ninteractions are present and workers\u2019 expected utility is not taken parametrically. This analysis\nprovides insights into the equilibrium of the finite market and, more importantly, it allows us to\nextend the micro-foundations of the market utility property to a very general environment.\nWe consider a finite economy with heterogeneous firms, homogeneous workers and general\nmatching and production technologies.1 As in the earlier literature, we assume that frictions\narise from workers\u2019 lack of coordination. The hiring process is formalized as a game where every\nfirm announces the payoffs that it offers and each worker decides how much effort to spend on\nsearching for each of the jobs after observing all the announcements. Lack of coordination is\ncaptured by restricting attention to equilibria where workers follow symmetric strategies. In\nsuch equilibria some firms receive too many workers (i.e. more workers search for this firm than\nit has available vacancies) while others receive too few.\nIn our first Theorem we prove that there exist equilibria in pure firm strategies if the pro-\nduction function satisfies a simple condition, essentially concavity, and the matching function\nhas some weak regularity properties. We combine existence in pure firm strategies with conver-\ngence theorems for the subgame of workers\u2019 applications (Peters (1997)) to show that the finite\neconomy equilibria converge to the equilibria of the continuum economy with a market utility\nproperty as the number of agents grows (Theorem 4). Pure strategies allow us to side-step\nmixed strategy convergence which is much more involved and has only been performed in simple\n1See the conclusions for a discussion of models with heterogeneous workers.\n3\nenvironments with risk-neutral workers and fixed productivity on the job (Peters (2000)).\nAdditionally, we provide characterization and efficiency results for the finite economy that are\ncurrently lacking.2 Existence in pure strategies allows us to evaluate a firm\u2019s strategy against its\ncompetitors\u2019 pure strategies which significantly reduces the complexity of characterizing equilib-\nria. We prove that, under an additional condition on the production function, the compensation\nthat a firm offers to its workers is increasing in its productivity (Theorem 2). Natural as this\nresult appears, the strategic interaction prevalent in finite economies means that it is not imme-\ndiate; indeed we provide an example where it fails when our additional condition is not satisfied.\nWe also show that the pure strategy equilibrium is unique when firms are homogeneous (Theorem\n3) proving that the equilibria characterized in Burdett, Shi and Wright (2001) are indeed unique.\nAn additional application of our existence result can be found in Galenianos, Kircher and Virag\n(2010) where it is shown that constrained efficiency does not obtain in finite economies, unlike in\ncontinuum ones, at least for certain production specifications. This result is of interest because it\nillustrates that the efficiency results prevalent in the literature (Moen (1997), Shi (2001), Shimer\n(2005)) are due to the combination of directed search with a large market and that directed\nsearch by itself does not deliver efficiency. We expect additional comparative statics and char-\nacterization results to be within reach, and conjecture that adaptations of our approach can be\nused to extend related finite settings such as Camera and Selcuk (2009), Geromichalos (2008),\nJulien, Kennes and King (2005) and Lester (2010).\nOn a more technical level, we should add that the strategic interaction among the agents in a\nfinite environment makes the equilibrium analysis non-trivial. Specifically, the action of a single\nfirm affects the payoffs of all market participants, which means that we need to keep track of the\nfull distribution of announcements when deriving the equilibrium conditions. Furthermore, it is\nnot a priori obvious that equilibria in pure firm strategies exist. For instance, Acemog\u02d8lu and\nOzdaglar (2007) show that equilibria in pure strategies need not exist in a related environment\n2An exception is Burdett, Shi and Wright (2001) who characterize finite equilibria for the case where firms\nand workers are homogeneous. Montgomery (1991) examines a finite market but assumes that firms behave\ncompetitively, essentially using the market utility property.\n4\nwhere pricing and congestion interact non-trivially.3\nFinally, finite directed search models resemble classical oligopoly problems. The demand\ncurve for a firm consists of the expected number of workers that want its job. It is smooth in\nits \u201cprice\u201d (i.e., the wage) due to the matching frictions. Even when there are more workers\nthan firms, the firms do not extract all rents because an individual firm has an incentive to raise\nthe wage in order to increase its probability of hiring. We contribute to the original motivation\nfor directed search models (Peters 1984, 1991) by characterizing the smooth demand system\n(Lemma 1). This enables a deeper understanding of the interaction of competitive price setting\nand matching frictions in finite economies and provides the basis for the other results in this\npaper.\n2 The General Model and Examples\nWe start with a description of the economic environment, strategies and equilibrium concept\nand then state our main existence theorem which is proved in Section 3. The model is presented\nin a sufficiently abstract way to encompass a number of environments. Section 2.2 elaborates\non various applied examples in detail, illustrating how many of the production and matching\nspecifications that have been used in the literature can be mapped into our setting.\n2.1 The General Model\nThe economy is populated with a finite number of firms and workers, denoted by \ud440 = {1, ...,\ud45a}\nand \ud441 = {1, ..., \ud45b} respectively, where \ud45a \u2265 2 and \ud45b \u2265 2. For production to take place, a\nfirm needs to hire a worker. All workers are ex ante identical and each of the (potentially\nheterogeneous) firms can hire at most one worker. The game starts with the hiring process.\nThen production takes place and payoffs are realized. The split of the surplus between worker\n3In their model, prices and congestion interact additively while in directed search the congestion (probability\nof trade) interacts with the price multiplicatively. Existence obtains in our setting for a large class of functional\nforms for the trading probability.\n5\nand firm is determined during the hiring process according to the posting game described below.\nThe payoff of being unmatched is normalized to zero for both firms and workers. Firms maximize\ntheir expected profits and workers maximize their expected utility.\nThe surplus generated when firm \ud457 fills its vacancy and provides utility \ud463 to its worker is\ndenoted by \ud446\ud457(\ud463).\n4 The firm\u2019s ex-post profits (i.e. conditional on a hire) are denoted by \ud70b\ud457(\ud463)\nso that \ud446\ud457(\ud463) = \ud70b\ud457(\ud463) + \ud463. Our first assumption presents the restrictions that we impose on the\nfirms\u2019 profit functions.5 Illustrations of some economic environments that fall within Assumption\n1 are presented in the next subsection.\nAssumption 1 We consider environments where for all \ud457 \u2208\ud440 :\ni. \ud70b\ud457(\ud463) is weakly concave,\nii. \ud70b\ud457(\ud463) is twice continuously differentiable,\niii. there are unique \ud463\ud457 and \ud463\ud457 such that \ud70b\ud457(\ud463\ud457) = 0 and \ud70b\ud457(\ud463\ud457) = max\ud463\u22650 \ud70b\ud457(\ud463).\n6\nThe Pareto frontier between a worker and a firm is linear (strictly concave) when \ud70b\ud457(\ud463) is linear\n(strictly concave). In the case of strict concavity, utility is imperfectly transferable between\nworkers and firms. Note that it is possible for the profit function to be increasing in the worker\u2019s\npayoff \ud463 at part of its domain, say when the worker has to exert costly effort (see example P6\nin Section 2.2). It is easy to see that, under Assumption 1, no firm has an incentive to make an\noffer below \ud463\ud457 or above \ud463\ud457 and therefore the space of utilities that firms might offer to workers\nis \ud4b1 \u2261 \u00d7\ud45a\ud457=1[\ud463\ud457, \ud463\ud457].\nThe hiring process has three stages. First, each firm simultaneously makes a public an-\nnouncement: It commits to the utility that it will provide to the worker that it hires. Second,\nworkers observe the announcements of all firms and each worker simultaneously applies to one\n4In some environments, the worker\u2019s payoff within a match is stochastic. In that case, \ud463 represents the worker\u2019s\nexpected utility conditional on getting the job. See Section 2.2 for illustrations.\n5These conditions can be rewritten in terms of \ud446\ud457(\u22c5). It turns out to be more convenient to work with \ud70b\ud457(\u22c5).\n6Workers\u2019 individual rationality means that \ud463\ud457 \u2265 0 is a necessary condition for a hire to occur.\n6\nfirm. Last, each firm goes through a recruitment process in which it hires at most one of its\napplicants, and remains idle if it does not receive any application. Recruitment is anonymous,\ni.e., each applicant has the same chance to get hired.\nThe strategy of worker \ud456 specifies the probability with which he applies to each firm after\nobserving some announcement v = (\ud4631, \ud4632, ..., \ud463\ud45a) \u2208 \ud4b1 . Let \ud45d\ud456\ud457(v) denote the probability that\nworker \ud456 applies to firm \ud457 after observing v. We focus our attention on equilibria where workers\nfollow symmetric strategies: \ud45d\ud456\ud457( v) = \ud45d\n\ud459\n\ud457(v) = \ud45d\ud457(v) for all \ud456, \ud459 \u2208 \ud441 . Such equilibria are\nintended to capture the frictions of labor markets. We denote the strategy of workers by the\nvector p(v) = (\ud45d1( v), ..., \ud45d\ud45a(v)). When there is no possibility for confusion, we suppress the\nargument v to keep notation simple.\nWe now specify the recruitment process, i.e., the mapping from the application strategies to\nthe probabilities of filling a vacancy (for firms) and finding a job (for workers). The probability\nthat a firm fills its vacancy when each worker applies there with probability \ud45d is denoted by\n\ud43b(\ud45d). The probability that a worker is hired by a firm where every other worker applies with\nprobability \ud45d is denoted by \ud43a(\ud45d). We allow for general functional forms for \ud43b(\ud45d) and \ud43a(\ud45d) that\nencompass a variety of specifications including the commonly-used urn-ball matching (e.g. in\nPeters (2000) or Burdett, Shi and Wright (2001)). Several examples are illustrated in the next\nsubsection. The next assumption summarizes the structure that we impose on the matching\nfunction.\nAssumption 2 \ud43b(\ud45d) and \ud43a(\ud45d) satisfy the following conditions for \ud45d \u2208 [0, 1]:\ni. \ud43b(\ud45d) is twice continuously differentiable, strictly increasing, concave and \ud43b(\ud45d) \u2208 [0, 1].\nii. \ud43a(\ud45d) is twice continuously differentiable, strictly decreasing, convex and \ud43a(\ud45d) \u2208 [0, 1].\niii. \ud43b(\ud45d) = \ud45b\ud45d\ud43a(\ud45d).\niv. 1\n\ud43a(\ud45d)\nis convex.\n7\nFurthermore, define \u210e(\ud45d) \u2261 \ud43b \u2032(\ud45d) and \ud454(\ud45d) \u2261 \ud43a\u2032(\ud45d). Parts i and ii ensure that \ud43b(\ud45d) and \ud43a(\ud45d) are\nprobabilities and they behave nicely. Part iii guarantees the consistency of the matching function\nin expectation terms: the probability that a firm fills its vacancy is equal to the probability that a\nworker is hired by that firm times the average number of applicants to that firm. This condition\nlinks the probability that a firm hires with the probability the a worker gets the job and it\nalso implies that a firm that attracts no applicants cannot hire (\ud43b(0) = 0). Part iv adds some\nstructure to the relation between \ud43b and \ud43a. Specifically, it implies that a firm\u2019s hiring probability\nis concave in its applicants\u2019 probability of getting the job.7 This assumption is frequently used\nin the search literature (e.g. Shi (2009)) and it is satisfied in many common specifications for the\nmeeting process, some of which we review below. In this paper, it is used to prove that workers\u2019\npayoffs are quasi-concave (Lemma 3).\nThere are two reasons behind our choice of a general matching function: First, it strengthens\nour results by showing that they do not depend on the specifics of urn-ball matching. Second,\nand more important, this paper\u2019s aim is to provide micro-foundations for the applied work that\nassumes more general matching functions such as Moen (1997), Acemoglu and Shimer (1999),\nRocheteau and Wright (2005), Guerrieri (2008), Menzio (2008) (see Section 5). It is worth\nemphasizing that the strategic interactions among agents are retained in our environment which\nis therefore strictly more general than the earlier literature.\nA worker\u2019s expected utility from applying to firm \ud457 is given by \ud43a(\ud45d\ud457)\ud463\ud457. Utility maximization\nleads to the following definition of the equilibrium in a subgame.\nDefinition 1 (Symmetric Subgame Equilibrium) A symmetric equilibrium in the subgame\nthat follows announcements v is a vector p(v) = (\ud45d1(v), ..., \ud45d\ud45b(v)) such that\n\u2211\n\ud457 \ud45d\ud457(v) = 1 and\nfor all \ud457 \u2208\ud440\n\ud45d\ud457(v) > 0\u21d2 \ud43a(\ud45d\ud457(v)) \ud463\ud457 = max\n\ud458\u2208\ud440\n\ud43a(\ud45d\ud458(v)) \ud463\ud458. (1)\n7Let \ud45d = \ud43a\u22121(\ud43a\u02c6) be the probability with which workers apply to a firm so that they get the job with probability\n\ud43a\u02c6 \u2208 [0, 1]. The firm\u2019s hiring probability is given by \ud43b\u00af(\ud43a\u02c6) = \ud45b\ud43a\u22121(\ud43a\u02c6)\ud43a\u02c6, according to part iii. Using the inverse\nfunction theorem yields \ud43b\u00af \u2032(\ud43a\u02c6) = \ud45b\ud43a\u22121(\ud43a\u02c6) + \ud45b\ud43a\u02c6\/\ud43a\u2032(\ud45d) and \ud43b\u00af \u2032\u2032(\ud43a\u02c6) = \ud45b[2\ud43a\u2032(\ud45d) \u2212 \ud43a\u02c6\ud43a\u2032\u2032(\ud45d)]\/(\ud43a\u20322. Finally, note\nthat \ud43b\u00af \u2032\u2032(\ud43a\u02c6) < 0\u21d4 2\ud43a\u2032(\ud45d)\u2212 \ud43a\u02c6\ud43a\u2032\u2032(\ud45d) < 0 which is equivalent to convexity of 1\/\ud43a(\ud45d).\n8\nIn words, for a worker to apply to firm \ud457 (\ud45d\ud457 > 0), he needs to receive a level of expected utility\nthat is at least as high as what he can get at any other firm.\nEach announcement v leads to a unique vector of application strategies if at least one firm\noffers strictly positive utility. That is, when workers follow symmetric strategies, the subgame\nequilibrium p(v) is unique given any v with \ud463\ud457 > 0 for some \ud457 \u2208\ud440 (Peters (1984), Proposition\n1).8 When v = 0 the workers\u2019 strategy is arbitrary. From now on we assume that \ud45d\ud457(0) = 1\/\ud45a\nfor all \ud457 \u2208 \ud440 but our results hold for any specification of p(0). We define market utility to be\nthe expected utility that workers obtain in the subgame and denote it by \ud448(v).\nWe say that firm \ud457 is active when \ud45d\ud457 > 0 and it is inactive when \ud45d\ud457 = 0. In the former case\nthe probability that the firm hires a worker is strictly positive; in the latter case it is zero. Let\n\ud434(v) \u2261 {\ud457 \u2208 \ud440 \u2223\ud45d\ud457(v) > 0} denote the set of active firms for a given v and note that it is non-\nempty. The set of inactive firms is denoted by \ud434\ud436(v). Following announcement v we can without\nloss of generality reshuffle the firms\u2019 indexes so that \ud434(v) = {1, ..., \ud459} and \ud434\ud436(v) = {\ud459+ 1, ...,\ud45a}\nif \ud459 < \ud45a, or \ud434\ud436(v) = \u2205 if \ud459 = \ud45a.\nWe now turn to the firms\u2019 problem in the first stage of the hiring process. Firm \ud457 takes as given\nthe announcements of the other firms, v\u2212\ud457, and the response of workers in the subgame p(v).\nThe expected profits of firm \ud457 are denoted by\n\u03a0\ud457(v) \u2261 \ud43b(\ud45d\ud457(v)) \ud70b\ud457(\ud463\ud457), (2)\nwhere \ud45d\ud457(v) solves (1). Profits are uniquely determined given v since each announcement leads\nto a unique set of application probabilities in the subgame.\nWe now define the equilibrium of this game. A directed search equilibrium is a pure strategy\nNash equilibrium in the game among firms with payoffs \u03a0\ud457(v). Formally:\n8Peters (1984) proves this result for urn-ball matching but his proof can be extended in a straightforward way\nto our setting.\n9\nDefinition 2 (Directed Search Equilibrium) A directed search equilibrium is a vector of\nannouncements v \u2208 \ud4b1 such that \u03a0\ud457(v) \u2265 \u03a0\ud457(\ud463\u2032\ud457,v\u2212\ud457) for all \ud463\u2032\ud457 \u2208 [\ud463\ud457, \ud463\ud457] and all \ud457 \u2208 \ud440 where\nthe workers\u2019 strategies are given by the symmetric subgame equilibrium.\nWe are ready to state our main result for the finite economy:\nTheorem 1 A directed search equilibrium exists when Assumptions 1 and 2 hold.\nThe next sections provide examples, show how to prove this result and how to characterize such\nequilibria. Readers interested in the foundations for large economies can find those in Section 5.\n2.2 Examples\nThis section illustrates that a number of production and matching environments that have been\nanalyzed in the directed search literature are encompassed into our framework. We first look at\nthe production side and Assumption 1 and then return to the matching side and Assumption 2.\nProduction: The following environments have appeared in the directed search literature and\nthey differ with respect to workers\u2019 preferences, the production technology and the informational\nstructure within a match.\nP 1. Canonical model. The canonical example of the directed search literature is the linear\nproduction environment: workers are risk-neutral and firm \ud457 produces \ud465\ud457 if it fills its va-\ncancy. In this environment each firm posts a wage \ud464, the value to the worker who obtains\nthis wage is \ud463 = \ud464, the profits of firms \ud457 are given by \ud70b\ud457(\ud463) = \ud465\ud457 \u2212 \ud463 and the surplus\ncreated when firm \ud457 becomes matched is \ud446\ud457(\ud463) = \ud465\ud457. In this example the Pareto frontier\nis linear. This environment is examined in Burdett, Shi and Wright (2001), Moen (1997),\n10\nMontgomery (1991) and Peters (2000).9\nP 2. Risk Aversion. Workers are risk averse, production is deterministic, each firm posts a\nwage \ud464 and cannot insure workers against unemployment. Denote the utility of a worker\nwho receives wage \ud464 by \ud463 = \ud717(\ud464). The profits of firm \ud457 are given by \ud465\ud457\u2212\ud464 and the surplus\ncreated when firm \ud457 fills its vacancy is \ud465\ud457 \u2212\ud464+ \ud717(\ud464). We can rewrite \ud70b\ud457(\ud463) = \ud465\ud457 \u2212 \ud717\u22121(\ud463)\nand note that \ud717\u22121(\u22c5) is convex due to risk aversion. Together with the requirement that\n\ud465\ud457 > \ud717\n\u22121(0), this environment satisfies Assumption 1. This model is analyzed in Acemog\u02d8lu\nand Shimer (1999).10\nP 3. Private match-specific information. Workers are ex-ante identical and privately draw\ntheir match-specific disutility of work after matching with a firm. Firms post wages. When\nthe wage is \ud464 and the disutility is \ud719, the worker\u2019s net utility is \ud464 \u2212 \ud719 and the worker\u2019s\nparticipation constraint implies that the he will refuse to work if \ud719 > \ud464. The worker\u2019s\nex ante utility is \ud463 =\n\u222b\n\ud719\u2264\ud464\ud457 [\ud464\ud457 \u2212 \ud719]\ud451\u03a6(\ud719) where \u03a6 is the disutility distribution. Un-\nder the standard monotone hazard rate condition for \u03a6 one can invert this relationship\nsuch that \ud464\ud457(\ud463) defines the wage that yields utility \ud463 to the worker. Profits are given by\n\ud70b\ud457(\ud463) =\n\u222b\n\ud719\u2264\ud464\ud457(\ud463)[\ud465\ud457 \u2212\ud464\ud457(\ud463)]\ud451\u03a6(\ud719) and the surplus is \ud70b\ud457(\ud463) + \ud463. It is not hard to show that\n\ud70b\ud457(\ud463) is concave in \ud463 under the monotone hazard rate condition.\n11 This environment is\nanalyzed in Guerrieri (2008).\n9This environment has been extended to consider multiple applications by Albrecht, Gautier and Vroman\n(2006), Galenianos and Kircher (2009) and Kircher (2009). In models of finite economies, multiple applications\nlead to severe technical complications as shown in Albrecht, Gautier, Tan and Vroman (2005). See Julien,\nKennes and King (2000) and Camera and Selcuk (2009) for models where wages are (potentially) renegotiated\nafter matching.\n10Notice that when workers are risk-averse, the optimal contract includes payments to workers who are not\nhired (Jacquet and Tan (2010)). Most of the literature, including this paper, ignores the possibility of such\npayments. One informal justification for this restriction on the contract space is the (unmodeled) existence of\nunqualified workers who are never hired but who would apply for jobs only to collect payments.\n11Profit \ud70b\ud457(\ud463) is concave if \ud464(\ud463) is convex, which is equivalent with \ud463 being concave in \ud464. Since \ud463\n\u2032(\ud464) = \u2212\u03a6(\ud464)\nwe have \ud463\u2032\u2032(\ud464) = \u2212\u03a6\u2032(\ud464) \u2264 0, because the density \u03a6\u2032(\ud464) is positive.\n11\nP 4. Endogenous intensive margin. Output is linear and disutility of work is convex in the\nhours of work. Firms post an hourly wage \ud464 and each hired worker decides how many\nhours to work. The worker\u2019s net utility is given by \ud463 = \ud464\ud461\u2212 \ud458(\ud461) where \ud461 is the time spent\nworking and \ud458(\ud461) is a strictly convex function representing the disutility of work. This\nexpression can be inverted to \ud464(\ud463) = [\ud463+ \ud458(\ud461)]\/\ud461 and implicitly define \ud461(\ud463) when combined\nwith \ud464(\ud463) = \ud458\u2032(\ud461) which is a necessary condition for optimal time allocation. When firm \ud457\nemploys a worker at hourly wage \ud464 it generates profits \ud70b\ud457(\ud463) = \ud465\ud457\ud461\u2212\ud464\ud461 = \ud465\ud457\ud461(\ud463)\u2212\ud463\u2212\ud458(\ud461(\ud463))\nand surplus \ud446\ud457(\ud463) = \ud465\ud457\ud461(\ud463) \u2212 \ud458(\ud461(\ud463)). A sufficient condition for the profit function to be\nconcave is \ud458\u2032\u2032\u2032(\ud461) \u2265 0.12 This environment is very similar to the product market model\nof Rocheteau and Wright (2005) and Berentsen, Menzio and Wright (2010) with buyers\ninstead of workers and sellers instead of firms. Our framework does not address the cost\nof holding money which is a feature in these papers.\nP 5. Endogenous intensive margin with private information. Consider the setting in\nExample P 2 with two differences. First, worker\u2019s disutility is \ud719\ud458(\ud461), where \ud719 is a disutility\nshock that workers draw before deciding on the hours of work from some distribution \u03a6\nwhich satisfies the monotone hazard rate. Second, firms post a (possibly non-linear) wage\nschedule \ud464(\ud461) that determines payments as a function of hours. Given the realization of\n\ud719 the worker chooses \ud461(\ud719) that maximizes \ud464(\ud461) \u2212 \ud719\ud458(\ud461) and his expected utility before\nobserving \ud719 is \ud463 =\n\u222b\n[\ud464(\ud461(\ud719)) \u2212 \ud719\ud458(\ud461(\ud719))]\ud451\u03a6(\ud719). Given a level \ud463 that firms want to leave\nto the worker, they choose the contract \ud464(\ud461) that fulfils the prior equality and maximizes\ntheir profits\n\u222b\n[\ud465\ud457\ud461(\ud719) \u2212 \ud464(\ud461(\ud719))]\ud451\u03a6(\ud719). The profit \ud70b(\ud463) is concave if \ud458\u2032\u2032\u2032(\ud461) \u2265 0. Faig and\nJerez (2006) examine this environment in a product market setting where a worker is a\nbuyer and \ud719 corresponds to his marginal valuation for the seller\u2019s (in our setting, firm\u2019s)\n12Since \ud463 \u2212 \ud458(\ud461(\ud463))\ud461(\ud463) + \ud458(\ud461(\ud463)) = 0 defines \ud461(\ud463), we have \ud461\u2032(\ud463) = [\ud458\u2032\u2032(\ud461(\ud463))\ud461(\ud463)]\u22121 \u2265 0 and \ud461\u2032\u2032(\ud463) =\n\u2212[\ud458\u2032\u2032(\ud461(\ud463))\ud461(\ud463)]\u22123[\ud458\u2032\u2032\u2032(\ud461(\ud463))\ud461(\ud463) + \ud458\u2032\u2032(\ud461(\ud463))] \u2264 0. Then \ud70b\u2032\u2032\ud457 (\ud463) = [\ud465 \u2212 \ud458\u2032(\ud461(\ud463))]\ud461\u2032\u2032(\ud463) \u2212 \ud458\u2032\u2032(\ud461(\ud463))\ud461\u2032(\ud463)\ud461(\ud463), which is\nnegative when \ud465 \u2212 \ud458\u2032(\ud461(\ud463)) \u2265 0. This is the case everywhere on [\ud463\ud457 , \ud463\ud457 ]. To see this, note that \ud458\u2032(\ud461(\ud463)) is equal\nto the wage that implements this utility, but only for \ud465\ud457 \u2212 \ud464 \u2265 0 the firm makes weakly positive profits, which\ndefined the range of possible offers [\ud463\ud457 , \ud463\ud457 ].\n12\ngood.\nP 6. Moral hazard. The firm does not observe the worker\u2019s effort \ud461 (moral hazard), output\n\ud466 within the match is stochastic and the firm posts an output-contingent wage schedule\n\ud464(\ud466). Output is given by \ud466 = \ud465\ud461 + \ud719, where \ud719 is drawn from some distribution \u03a6 with\nincreasing hazard rate. Only the worker observes \ud719 and he then chooses \ud461(\ud719) to maximize\nhis net utility \ud464(\ud466)\u2212 \ud458(\ud461), where \ud458(\ud461) is a convex cost of effort. His expected utility from\na schedule \ud464(\ud466) is \ud463 =\n\u222b\n[\ud464(\ud465\ud461(\ud719) + \ud719) \u2212 \ud458(\ud461(\ud719))]\ud451\u03a6(\ud719). For a given \ud463 there is a contract\nthat yields the highest profit \ud70b(\ud463) to the firm. Also, \ud458\u2032\u2032\u2032(\ud461) > 0 is a sufficient condition for\n\ud70b(\u22c5) to be concave. Moen and Rozen (2007) analyze this framework.\nMatching: We provide several structural examples of matching functions that can be used\nin our framework. These examples differ in the elasticity of the hiring probability with respect\nto the number of firms in the economy and the elasticity of substitution between the expected\nnumber of applicants and the number of firms. Consider the case when all workers apply with\nprobability \ud45d\ud457 to firm \ud457.\nM 1. Urn-ball. Workers send their application to firm \ud457 with probability \ud45d\ud457. Assume that if\na firm receives at least one application, it hires one of the applicants. This results in a\nBinomial distribution where firm \ud457 has \ud45b tries (\ud45b is the number of workers) and each try is\nsuccessful with probability \ud45d\ud457 (i.e. each worker applies to firm \ud457 with probability \ud45d\ud457). The\nprobability that a firm has at least one applicant is \ud43b(\ud45d\ud457) = 1\u2212(1\u2212\ud45d\ud457)\ud45b. This specification\nhas been used in much of the literature, e.g. in Peters (1991, 2000), Montgomery (1991),\nBurdett, Shi and Wright (2001), Shi (2001) and Shimer (2005).\nM 2. Qualification shocks. Extend the previous example with a match-specific shock that\nrenders an applicant unqualified with probability \ud70f (this could also represent the probabil-\nity that the application is lost in the mail, etc). In this case a firm has a qualified applicant\n13\nwith probability \ud43b(\ud45d\ud457) = 1\u2212 (1\u2212 (1\u2212 \ud70f)\ud45d\ud457)\ud45b, since the probability of a qualified applica-\ntion is (1 \u2212 \ud70f)\ud45d\ud457 rather than \ud45d\ud457 as in the previous example. This example is described in\nPetrongolo and Pissarides (2001) to deal with some of the perceived short-comings of the\nstandard urn-ball specification.\nM 3. Limited interview capacity. Consider example M 2 and assume that a worker needs\nto be interviewed for a job in order to find out whether he is qualified, but a firm has\nonly a limited number of interview slots. If the firm can interview no more than \ud45b\u00af < \ud45b\napplicants, then the probability of hiring of hiring is \ud43b(\ud45d\ud457) =\n\u2211\ud45b\u00af\u22121\n\ud456=1 \ud435(\ud456, \ud45b, \ud45d\ud457)(1 \u2212 \ud70f \ud456) +\u2211\ud45b\n\ud456=\ud45b\u00af\ud435(\ud456, \ud45b, \ud45d\ud457)(1\u2212 \ud70f \ud45b\u00af). Consider the first sum: \ud435(\ud456, \ud45b, \ud45d\ud457) =\n(\n\ud456\n\ud45b\n)\n\ud45d\ud456\ud457(1\u2212 \ud45d\ud457)1\u2212\ud456 is the Bino-\nmial probability that \ud456 applicants apply, and 1\u2212 \ud70f \ud456 is the probability that at least one of\nthem is qualified. The second sum is similar, but due to limited interview capacity only \ud45b\u00af\nof the \ud456 applicants can be evaluated. Such a process is examined in Wolthoff (2009).\nM 4. Spatial search and CES matching. Other matching functions are feasible even though\nthey have not been explicitly micro-founded. One example that satisfies Assumption 2 is\n\ud43b(\ud45d\ud457) = \ud45b\ud45d\ud457\/(\ud45b\ud45d\ud457 + \ud459) for \ud459 > 0 which approaches the well-known telephone-line matching\nfunction as the economy becomes large (see Section 5) and fits the specification in Ro-\ncheteau and Wright (2005) and Guerrieri (2008). One way to micro-found this matching\nfunction might be to think of \ud45d\ud457 as the fraction of workers\u2019 search time in a particular\ngeographic area in the proximity of firm \ud457, and the owner of the firm hires if he meets one\nof the workers rather than one of the other \ud459 people that are also in the neighborhood. It\nis a special case of \ud43b(\ud45d) = [(\ud45b\ud45d)\u2212\ud70e + 1]\u22121\/\ud70e when \ud70e = 1. This broader specification fulfills\nour assumptions for all \ud70e \u2208 (0, 1) and resembles the popular CES matching function. We\nexpect many other specifications to fit our framework as well.\n14\n3 Existence of Equilibrium\nThe following three subsections are devoted to the proof of Theorem 1. First, we examine\nthe subgame that follows an arbitrary announcement by the firms and show that the workers\u2019\nprobability of applying to some firm \ud457 is quasi-concave in that firm\u2019s announcement. Then, we\nshow that a firm\u2019s expected profits are quasi-concave in its announcement, \ud463\ud457. Finally, we prove\nexistence by using a fixed point argument which is extended to deal with the discontinuity in\nprofits that often arises in models with a finite number of agents.\n3.1 Analysis of the Subgame\nIn this section we characterize the workers\u2019 response to an arbitrary announcement by the firms\nv, and we determine how that response changes when some \ud463\ud457 changes.\nCharacterization of Subgame: We characterize p(v) in two steps. First, we determine the set\nof active firms. Then we determine the exact probabilities with which workers visit the active\nfirms.\nRecalling that \ud448(v) = max\ud457 \ud43a(\ud45d\ud457(v))\ud463\ud457, we rewrite equation (1) as\n\ud43a(\ud45d\ud457(v))\ud463\ud457 = \ud448(v), \u2200\ud457 \u2208 \ud434(v),\n\ud43a(\ud45d\ud457(v))\ud463\ud457 \u2264 \ud448(v), \u2200\ud457 \u2208 \ud434\ud436(v).\nTo determine whether firm \ud457 is active or inactive, compare \ud463\ud457 with \ud448(v). If \ud463\ud457 > \ud448(\ud463\ud457,v\u2212\ud457), then\n\ud45d\ud457 > 0. Equivalently, \ud463\ud457 < \ud448(\ud463\ud457,v\u2212\ud457) implies that \ud45d\ud457 = 0. Last, if the announcement of some\nfirm \ud457 is exactly on the boundary (\ud463\ud457 = \ud448(\ud463\ud457,v\u2212\ud457)) then that firm is inactive (\ud45d\ud457 = 0); if it were\nactive then \ud43a(\ud45d\ud457) < 1 which leads to \ud43a(\ud45d\ud457) \ud463\ud457 < \ud448(v) contradicting subgame equilibrium.\n13\nTo summarize these results, note that the workers\u2019 market utility only depends on active firms:\nif \ud45d\ud457(\ud463\ud457,v\u2212\ud457) = 0 then \ud448(\ud463\ud457,v\u2212\ud457) = \ud448(0,v\u2212\ud457). The following condition determines whether a\n13In other words, the correspondence \ud434(v) is lower hemi-continuous in v.\n15\nfirm is (in)active:\n\ud457 \u2208 \ud434\ud436(v)\u21d4 \ud463\ud457 \u2264 \ud463\u02c6\ud457(v\u2212\ud457) \u2261 \ud448(0,v\u2212\ud457). (3)\nWe now focus on the active firms. In equilibrium, the exact probability with which a worker\napplies to each of the firms in \ud434(v) is determined by the requirement that he is indifferent across\nthem:\n\ud43a(\ud45d\ud458) \ud463\ud458 \u2212\ud43a(\ud45d\ud459) \ud463\ud459 = 0, \u2200 \ud458 \u2208 \ud434(v)\/{\ud459}, (4)\u2211\n\ud458\u2208\ud434(v)\n\ud45d\ud458 \u2212 1 = 0. (5)\nEquations (4) and (5) define a system F of \ud459 equations with \ud459 exogenous and \ud459 endogenous\nvariables. The announcements v\u02c6 \u2261 (\ud4631, ..., \ud463\ud459) of the active firms are the exogenous variables\nand the probabilities p\u02c6 \u2261 (\ud45d1, ..., \ud45d\ud459) are the endogenous variables.\nEquations (3), (4) and (5) fully describe the equilibrium of the subgame. As noted in Section\n2.1, p(v) is uniquely defined when \ud463\ud457 > 0 for some \ud457 \u2208\ud440 and we assume that \ud45d\ud457(0) = 1\/\ud45a.\nWorkers\u2019 reaction to a change in a firm\u2019s announcement: We now examine how the equilibrium\nof the subgame changes when the announcement of firm \ud457 is perturbed from \ud463\ud457 to some \ud463\n\u2032\n\ud457. Let\nv denote the initial announcement and suppose that \ud463\ud458 > 0 for some \ud458 \u2208\ud440 . The case of v = 0\nis treated separately below. We will use the implicit function theorem on equations (4) and (5)\nbut we first need to determine whether the set of active firms changes, i.e. whether \ud434(\ud463\u2032\ud457,v\u2212\ud457)\nis the same as \ud434(\ud463\ud457,v\u2212\ud457).\nConsider firm \ud457 with \ud457 \u2208 \ud434(\ud463\ud457,v\u2212\ud457) and note that \ud448(\ud463\u2032\ud457,v\u2212\ud457) > \ud448(\ud463\ud457,v\u2212\ud457)\u21d4 \ud463\u2032\ud457 > \ud463\ud457. When\n16\n\ud463\u2032\ud457 is \u201cclose enough\u201d to \ud463\ud457 we have that \ud457 \u2208 \ud434(\ud463\u2032\ud457,v\u2212\ud457). Furthermore, given any \ud458 \u2215= \ud457:\n\ud463\ud458 > \ud448(\ud463\ud457,v\u2212\ud457) \u21d2 \ud458 \u2208 \ud434(\ud463\ud457,v\u2212\ud457) and \ud458 \u2208 \ud434(\ud463\u2032\ud457,v\u2212\ud457)\n\ud463\ud458 < \ud448(\ud463\ud457,v\u2212\ud457) \u21d2 \ud458 \u2208 \ud434\ud436(\ud463\ud457,v\u2212\ud457) and \ud458 \u2208 \ud434\ud436(\ud463\u2032\ud457,v\u2212\ud457)\n\ud463\ud458 = \ud448(\ud463\ud457,v\u2212\ud457) and \ud463\u2032\ud457 > \ud463\ud457 \u21d2 \ud458 \u2208 \ud434\ud436(\ud463\ud457,v\u2212\ud457) and \ud458 \u2208 \ud434\ud436(\ud463\u2032\ud457,v\u2212\ud457)\n\ud463\ud458 = \ud448(\ud463\ud457,v\u2212\ud457) and \ud463\u2032\ud457 < \ud463\ud457 \u21d2 \ud458 \u2208 \ud434\ud436(\ud463\ud457, v\u2212\ud457) and \ud458 \u2208 \ud434(\ud463\u2032\ud457,v\u2212\ud457)\nWhen \ud457 \u2208 \ud434\ud436(\ud463\ud457,v\u2212\ud457) we have two cases to consider. First, if \ud463\ud457 < \ud448(v) then firm \ud457 at-\ntracts no applicants after a small enough perturbation, the market utility remains unchanged (\n\ud448(\ud463\u2032\ud457,v\u2212\ud457) = \ud448(\ud463\ud457,v\u2212\ud457)) and therefore \ud434(\ud463\n\u2032\n\ud457,v\u2212\ud457) = \ud434(\ud463\ud457,v\u2212\ud457). Second, when \ud463\ud457 = \ud448(v) then an\nincrease in \ud463\ud457 means that firm \ud457 starts attracting applicants and the market utility increases:\n14\n\ud463\u2032\ud457 > \ud463\ud457 \u21d2 \ud457 \u2208 \ud434(\ud463\u2032\ud457,v\u2212\ud457) and \ud448(\ud463\u2032\ud457,v\u2212\ud457) > \ud448(\ud463\ud457,v\u2212\ud457). When \ud463\ud457 = \ud448(v) and \ud463\u2032\ud457 < \ud463\ud457, the market\nutility is not affected and the set of active firms remains unchanged.\nEssentially, \ud434(v) is constant in \ud463\ud457 unless some firm is exactly on the boundary for being active.\nFor a given v\u2212\ud457, this argument implies that there are at most \ud45a critical points for \ud463\ud457 \u2208 [\ud463\ud457, \ud463\ud457]\nwhere some firm (possibly including \ud457) is exactly on the boundary. Let \u03a8\ud457(v\u2212\ud457) denote the set of\nannouncements by firm \ud457 where some firm is on the boundary, given v\u2212\ud457; similarly, let \u03a9\ud457(v\u2212\ud457)\ndenote the set of announcements where \ud463\ud458 \u2215= \ud448(v) for all \ud458 \u2208 \ud440 (we occasionally omit the\nargument v\u2212\ud457 for notational simplicity). The lemma summarizes our results.\nLemma 1 The set \u03a8\ud457(v\u2212\ud457) contains a finite number of points.\nProof. See above.\nWe now characterize how p changes in response to a change in \ud463\ud457. We will show that\n\ud45d\ud457(\ud463\ud457,v\u2212\ud457) is quasi-concave in \ud463\ud457. We first focus on announcements in \u03a9\ud457 and then generalize\nour results to the full domain \u03a9\ud457 \u222a\u03a8\ud457.\n14Recall that \ud463\ud457 = \ud448(v) implies \ud45d\ud457 = 0 and hence firm \ud457 is inactive.\n17\nConsider an announcement (\ud463\ud457,v\u2212\ud457) where \ud463\ud457 \u2208 \u03a9\ud457(v\u2212\ud457) and some perturbation v\u2032 = (\ud463\u2032\ud457,v\u2212\ud457).\nWhen \ud463\u2032\ud457 is close enough to \ud463\ud457 the set of active firms does not change: \ud434(v) = \ud434(v\n\u2032). If \ud463\ud457 < \ud448(v)\nthen firm \ud457 is inactive both under v and under v\u2032 and therefore p is not affected by a small\nchange in \ud463\ud457, i.e. \u2202\ud45d\ud458\/\u2202\ud463\ud457 = 0 \u2200 \ud458. If \ud463\ud457 > \ud448(v) , we shall apply the implicit function theorem\naround F(p\u02c6, v\u02c6) = 0. The Jacobian of F with respect to (\ud45d1, ..., \ud45d\ud459) is given by\n\ud437p\ud439=\n\u239b\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\ud7091(v) 0 0 ... 0 \u2212\ud709\ud459(v)\n0 \ud7092(v) 0 ... 0 \u2212\ud709\ud459(v)\n... ... ... ... ... ...\n0 0 0 ... \ud709\ud459\u22121(v) \u2212\ud709\ud459(v)\n1 1 1 ... 1 1\n\u239e\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n,\nwhere \ud709\ud458(v) \u2261 \ud454(\ud45d\ud458( v)) \ud463\ud458 denotes the change in the expected utility offered by firm \ud458 due\nto an increase in \ud45d\ud458. The rank of this matrix is \ud459: the expected utility of applying to firm \ud458\ndecreases in \ud45d\ud458 and therefore \ud709\ud458 \u2215= 0 for all \ud458 \u2208 \ud434(v). As a result we can apply the implicit\nfunction theorem to show that \u2202\ud45d\ud457(v)\/\u2202\ud463\ud457 exists locally around v and that the matrix of partial\nderivatives is defined by \ud437vp = \u2212(\ud437 pF)\u22121\ud437vF. The following lemma describes our result:\nLemma 2 (Workers\u2019 response to a perturbation in the announcements) When \ud463\ud457 \u2208 \u03a9\ud457(v\u2212\ud457)\nand \ud457 \u2208 \ud434(v) a change in \ud463\ud457 leads to\n\u2202\ud45d\ud457(v)\n\u2202\ud463\ud457\n= \ud447\ud457(v)\n\u22121 \ud43a(\ud45d\ud457(v)), (6)\nwhere \ud447\ud457(v) = \u2212\ud709\ud457(v)\u2212 [\n\u2211\n\ud458\u2208\ud434( v)\u2216{\ud457} \ud709\ud458(v)\n\u22121]\u22121.\nProof. See the appendix.\nFinally, when v\u2212\ud457 = 0\u2212\ud457 we have \ud45d\ud457(\ud463\ud457,0\u2212\ud457) = 1\/\ud45a for \ud463\ud457 = 0 and \ud45d\ud457(\ud463\ud457,0\u2212\ud457) = 1 for \ud463\ud457 > 0.\nSimilarly, for all \ud458 \u2215= \ud457 we have \ud45d\ud458(0) = 1\/\ud45a when \ud463\ud457 = 0 and \ud45d\ud458(v) = 0 when \ud463\ud457 > 0. In other\n18\nwords, \ud45d\ud457(\ud463\ud457,0\u2212\ud457) is discontinuous at \ud463\ud457 = 0 and 0 \u2208 \u03a8\ud457(0\u2212\ud457).\nThis characterization result is key to our analysis. It describes the change in the workers\u2019\nprobability of applying for a particular job when the firm changes its announcement. It has a\nclear economic interpretation. First, the response is stronger if the probability of getting the job\n\ud43a(\ud45d\ud457) is higher. Clearly, a given increase in \ud463 translates into a higher gain for an individual worker\nwhen the job is easier to get in the first place. The response is negatively related to the marginal\nbenefit \u2223\ud709\ud457(v)\u2223. A large \u2223\ud709\ud457(v)\u2223 means that an increase in the application probability at firm \ud457\ndiminishes the workers\u2019 utility from applying to firm \ud457 by a large amount. In that case a small\nincrease of the application probabilities by workers is sufficient to equalize the expected utilities\nacross all firms. Similarly, the strength of the response is negatively related to the marginal\nbenefit \u2223\ud709\ud458(v)\u2223 at some other firm \ud458. When firm \ud457 improves its announcement, workers apply\nmore to \ud457 and less to other firms. If the expected utility of applying to other firms improves\nquickly, then workers shift only little additional application probability to firm \ud457 before the\nexpected utilities across firms is again equalized. Therefore, the response by workers is related\nin a tractable way to the change of expected utility of the current firm and its competitors. Note\nthat the components of workers\u2019 response that relate to firm \ud458 \u2215= \ud457 arise because of the strategic\ninteractions across firms.\nWe use Lemma 2 to prove \ud45d\ud457 is quasi-concave on the full domain of announcements. In\nparticular when v\u2212\ud457 \u2215= 0\u2212\ud457 the application probability \ud45d\ud457(\ud463\ud457,v\u2212\ud457) is equal to zero for \ud463\ud457 \u2264 \ud463\u02c6\ud457(v\u2212\ud457)\nand it is strictly concave for \ud463\ud457 \u2265 \ud463\u02c6\ud457(v\u2212\ud457). When v\u2212\ud457 = 0\u2212\ud457 the application probability is\ndiscontinuous at \ud463\ud457 = 0 with \ud45d\ud457(0,0\u2212\ud457) = 1\/\ud45a and \ud45d\ud457(\ud463\ud457,0\u2212\ud457) = 1 for \ud463\ud457 > 0.\nLemma 3 The application probability \ud45d\ud457(\ud463\ud457,v\u2212\ud457) is quasi-concave in \ud463\ud457 for given v\u2212\ud457.\nProof. See the appendix.\n19\n3.2 Analysis of firms\u2019 strategies\nWe now analyze how profits change when a firm\u2019s announcement is perturbed. The goal is to\nprove the quasi-concavity of expected profits.\nConsider firm \ud457 and fix the other firms\u2019 announcement v\u2212\ud457. We first focus on \ud463\ud457 \u2208 \u03a9\ud457(v\u2212\ud457)\nand we describe how to extend our results to \ud463\ud457 \u2208 \u03a8\ud457(v\u2212\ud457) below (the case of v\u2212\ud457 = 0 is\ntreated separately). If \ud463\ud457 < \ud463\u02c6\ud457(v\u2212\ud457) then firm \ud457 is inactive, its expected profits are zero and\n\u2202\u03a0\ud457( v)\/\u2202\ud463\ud457 = 0. If \ud463\ud457 > \ud463\u02c6\ud457(v\u2212\ud457) then firm \ud457 is active and the first derivative of its expected\nprofits with respect to its own announcement is\n\u2202\u03a0\ud457(\ud463\ud457,v\u2212\ud457)\n\u2202\ud463\ud457\n= \ud43b(\ud45d\ud457(\ud463\ud457,v\u2212\ud457))\n\ud451\ud70b\ud457(\ud463\ud457)\n\ud451\ud463\ud457\n+ \u210e(\ud45d\ud457(\ud463\ud457,v\u2212\ud457))\ud70b\ud457(\ud463\ud457)\n\u2202\ud45d\ud457(\ud463\ud457,v\u2212\ud457)\n\u2202\ud463\ud457\n. (7)\nThe second derivative is\n\u22022\u03a0\ud457(\ud463\ud457,v\u2212\ud457)\n\u2202\ud4632\ud457\n= \ud43b(\ud45d\ud457(\ud463\ud457,v\u2212\ud457))\n\ud4512\ud70b\ud457(\ud463\ud457)\n\ud451\ud4632\ud457\n+ 2 \u210e(\ud45d\ud457(\ud463\ud457,v\u2212\ud457))\n\ud451\ud70b\ud457(\ud463\ud457)\n\ud451\ud463\ud457\n\u2202\ud45d\ud457(\ud463\ud457,v\u2212\ud457)\n\u2202\ud463\ud457\n+ \u210e\u2032(\ud45d\ud457(\ud463\ud457,v\u2212\ud457))\n(\u2202\ud45d\ud457(\ud463\ud457,v\u2212\ud457)\n\u2202\ud463\ud457\n)2\n\ud70b\ud457(\ud463\ud457) + \u210e(\ud45d\ud457(\ud463\ud457,v\u2212\ud457))\ud70b\ud457(\ud463\ud457)\n\u22022\ud45d\ud457(\ud463\ud457,v\u2212\ud457)\n\u2202\ud4632\ud457\n.(8)\nIt is not hard to see that equation (8) is negative. The first term is weakly negative since \ud70b\ud457 is\nweakly concave. The second term is weakly negative since \ud70b\ud457 is weakly decreasing on [\ud463\ud457, \ud463\ud457],\n\u210e(\ud45d\ud457) > 0 and \u2202\ud45d\ud456\/\u2202\ud463\ud456 > 0. The third term is non-positive since \u210e\n\u2032(\ud45d\ud456) \u2264 0, and the fourth\nterm is strictly negative because of \u22022\ud45d\ud456\/\u2202\ud463\n2\n\ud456 < 0. Therefore, expected profits \u03a0\ud457 are strictly\nconcave on (\ud463\u02c6\ud457(v\u2212\ud457), \ud463\ud457) \u2229 \u03a9\ud457(v\u2212\ud457). This result can be extended to the elements in \u03a8\ud457(v\u2212\ud457)\nusing the same arguments as in the proof of Lemma 3. When v\u2212\ud457 = 0, the expected profits of\nfirm \ud457 are discontinuous at \ud463\ud457 = 0 due to the discontinuity of \ud45d\ud457 at v = 0. More specifically,\n\u03a0\ud457(\ud463\ud457,0\u2212\ud457) = \ud70b\ud457(0)\/\ud45a when \ud463\ud457 = 0 and \u03a0\ud457(\ud463\ud457,0\u2212\ud457) = \ud70b\ud457(\ud463\ud457) when \ud463\ud457 > 0.\nWe have established that a firm\u2019s expected profits are quasi-concave in its announcement. In\nparticular we have shown that when v\u2212\ud457 \u2215= 0\u2212\ud457 the expected profits of firm \ud457 are continuous,\nequal to zero for \ud463\ud457 \u2208 [\ud463\ud457, \ud463\u02c6\ud457(v\u2212\ud457)] and strictly concave for \ud463\ud457 \u2208 [\ud463\u02c6\ud457(v\u2212\ud457), \ud463\ud457]; therefore, \u03a0\ud457(\ud463\ud457,v\u2212\ud457)\n20\nis quasi-concave on [0, \ud463\ud457]. When v\u2212\ud457 = 0\u2212\ud457, the expected profits are discontinuous at \ud463\ud457 = 0\nwith \u03a0\ud457(0,0\u2212\ud457) = \ud70b\ud457(0)\/\ud45a and \u03a0\ud457(\ud463\ud457,0\u2212\ud457) = \ud70b\ud457(\ud463\ud457) for \ud463\ud457 \u2208 (0, \ud463\ud457].\nLemma 4 Expected profits \u03a0\ud457(\ud463\ud457,v\u2212\ud457) are quasi-concave in \ud463\ud457 for given v\u2212\ud457.\nProof. See above.\nIt is worth remarking that this lemma is not sufficient to rule out mixed strategy equilibria.\nThe quasi-concavity of firm \ud457\u2019s expected profits is shown when the other firms follow pure strate-\ngies. Under mixed strategies, the profits of firm \ud457 from posting \ud463\ud457 is given by the weighted sum of\nthe expected profits that result from each realization of the other firms\u2019 announcement where the\nweights are equal to each realization\u2019s probability. Since the sum of quasi-concave functions is\nnot necessarily quasi-concave, we cannot rule out that firm \ud457\u2019s best response to mixed strategies\nis also a mixed strategy.\n3.3 Finding a Fixed Point\nThe final step to prove the existence of a directed search equilibrium is to find a fixed point in\nfirms\u2019 strategies. The strategy space, \ud4b1 , is compact and the expected profit function is quasi-\nconcave. However, as show above, profits are discontinuous at v = 0.\nWhen \ud4b1 does not include 0, i.e. if \ud463\ud457 > 0 for some \ud457, then existence follows by standard\nfixed point arguments: the expected profit function is continuous and therefore the best response\ncorrespondence of the firms is upper hemi-continuous by Berge\u2019s Theorem. Quasi-concavity of\nprofits leads to a convex-valued best-response correspondence and Kakutani\u2019s fixed point theorem\nensures the existence of an equilibrium.\nHowever, when 0 \u2208 \ud4b1 we have to deal with the resulting discontinuity. To prove existence\nwe use the concept of Better-Reply Security of Reny (1999). In our environment Better-Reply\nSecurity means the following. Consider any v \u2208 \ud4b1 that is not an equilibrium announcement and\nany sequence v\u210e \u2208 \ud4b1 such that v\u210e \u2192 v as \u210e \u2192 \u221e with limit payoff vector (\u03a01,\u03a02, ..,\u03a0\ud45a) =\nlim\u210e\u2192\u221e(\u03a01(v\u210e),\u03a02(v\u210e), ..,\u03a0\ud45a(v\u210e)). The game among firms is Better-Reply Secure if there exists\n21\na player \ud457 and an action \ud463\u02dc\ud457 such that \u03a0\ud457(\ud463\u02dc\ud457, v\u02dc\u2212\ud457) > \u03a0\ud457 for all v\u02dc\u2212\ud457 in the neighborhood of v\u2212\ud457.\nThat is, if the original announcement is not an equilibrium then there exists a firm that can\nalways do strictly better even if the other firms slightly deviate from the profile. When profits\nare continuous around v, this is trivially the case.\nWe only have to check the condition for the case when all firms offer zero, i.e. at v = 0. For\nany sequence of v\u210e converging to zero there is some firm \ud457 that in the limit has an application\nprobability below the average, i.e. \ud45d\ud457 \u2264 1\/\ud45a and its payoffs are \u03a0\ud457 \u2264 \ud43b(1\/\ud45a)\ud70b\ud457(0). If firm \ud457\noffers \ud463\u02dc\ud457 = \ud700, then all workers apply to firm \ud457 as long as \ud463\ud458 < \ud700\/\ud45b for all \ud458 \u2215= \ud457. So for every\n\ud700 there is a neighborhood around the strategy of the other firms such that firm \ud457 hires with\nprobability one. By the continuity of the ex post profit function, firm \ud457 can ensure itself a payoff\nclose to \ud70b\ud457(0) for \ud700 small enough. This is strictly higher than \u03a0\ud457 because the firm can now hire\nfor sure and hence the game is Better-Reply Secure. As a result, an equilibrium exists by the\nfixed point Theorem 3.1 in Reny (1999).\nThis concludes the proof of Theorem 1.\n4 Characterization of the Equilibrium Set\nIn this section we characterize the equilibrium set. We show that more productive firms will\nin equilibrium offer higher utility to workers under an additional assumption on the production\ntechnology. Additionally, we provide an example where our assumption does not hold and the\nmore productive firm offers lower utility. We then show that the directed search equilibrium is\nunique when firms are homogeneous.\nWe first need to rank firms by their productivity. We will use the following definition and\nonly consider environments where the firms can be ranked accordingly.\n22\nDefinition 3 We say that firm \ud457 is more productive than firm \ud458 if\n\ud70b\ud457(0) \u2265 \ud70b\ud458(0) and (9)\n\ud451\ud70b\ud457(\ud463)\/\ud451\ud463 \u2265 \ud451\ud70b\ud458(\ud463)\/\ud451\ud463 \u2200 \ud463. (10)\nIf one of the inequalities is strict, we say that firm \ud457 is strictly more productive than firm \ud458. If\nboth (9) and (10) hold with equality, then we say that firms \ud457 and \ud458 are equally productive.\nEquation (9) states that when workers receive zero utility the profits of firm \ud457 are weakly\nhigher than the profits of firm \ud458. Equation (10) states that the profits of firm \ud457 increase faster\n(or drop more slowly) than \ud458\u2019s when workers\u2019 utility increases. It immediately follows that for a\ngiven level of worker utility, firm \ud457 makes higher profits than \ud458. For example, in the linear profit\nfunctions \ud70b\ud457(\ud463) = \ud465\ud457 \u2212 \ud463 of Montgomery (1991) and Burdett, Shi and Wright (2001), Definition\n3 translates into our usual notion of being more productive (\ud465\ud457 \u2265 \ud465\ud458) because the slopes of the\nprofit functions are identical. Note, however, that Definition 3 is a strictly stronger requirement\nthan \ud70b\ud457(\ud463) \u2265 \ud70b\ud457(\ud463) for all \ud463.\nProving that more productive firms offer higher utility to prospective employees is straight-\nforward in the context of a continuum economy. One need only establish the following simple\nsingle-crossing condition between the probability of hiring, \ud43b, and the utility that is offered to\nworkers, \ud463: to \u201cgain\u201d a unit increase in \ud43b, a more productive firm is always willing to raise \ud463 by\na larger amount than a less productive firm. In a continuum economy, this argument is sufficient\nto show that more productive firms offer higher utility to workers.\nHowever, this logic does not apply in a finite economy because a single firm\u2019s action affects\nmarket outcomes and, in particular, the probability of hiring when making a given offer. Consider\ntwo firms (say 1 and 2) that currently offer different levels of utility (\ud4631 and \ud4632) and are both\ncontemplating a deviation to some \ud463\u02c6. The hiring probability that firm 1 faces if it offers \ud463\u02c6 is\ndifferent from the one that firm 2 faces because the overall distribution of offers will be different:\nif firm 1 deviates to \ud463\u02c6 then the distribution includes \ud463\u02c6 and \ud4632 but not \ud4631; if firm 2 deviates,\n23\nthe distribution includes \ud463\u02c6 and \ud4631 but not \ud4632. Therefore the hiring probability when offering \ud463\u02c6\ndepends on which firm is making that offer. As a result, single-crossing in terms of preferences\nis not enough because the \u201ctechnology\u201d by which a firm can convert the utility that it offers\ninto the probability of hiring differs for the different firms. Maybe the easiest way to see that\nour main result in Theorem 2 is non-trivial due to the strategic interactions is the observation\nthat one can construct environments with equilibria that are not characterized by first order\nconditions where higher productivity firms indeed pay lower wages (see Example 1 below).\nWe prove our result for equilibria that are characterized by first order conditions, because\nour proof relies on a direct comparison of these conditions. However, it is not necessary for\nthe equilibrium to be characterized by the first order conditions and we provide an additional\ncondition which guarantees that this first order approach is valid. The reason why the first order\nconditions need not hold in equilibrium is that a firm\u2019s expected profits may contain kinks. To\nsee this, consider a firm (say, firm 1) that offers \ud4631 and is active and suppose that some other\nfirm (say, firm 2) offers \ud4632 and is on the boundary for being active. Think of how the expected\nprofits of firm 1 are affected by a change in \ud4631: If firm 1 reduces its announcement the market\nutility will fall and firm 2 will become active, adding a competitor for workers\u2019 services; this\nmakes the supply of workers more elastic with respect to the announcement. Formally, in (6)\nthe strictly negative term \ud7092(\ud4631, \ud4632) = \ud454(0)\ud4632 is additionally introduced when firm 1 reduces its\nannouncement.15 If firm 1 increases its offer the market utility will increase, firm 2 will remain\ninactive and the supply of workers will be less elastic with respect to \ud4631. This means that the\nadditional term does not appear in (6). This creates a kink in the expected profits of firm 1, and\ntherefore its the optimal choice may not be characterized by a first order condition.\nThe following assumption is sufficient to rule out the scenario described above by guaranteeing\nthat all firms are active. More precisely, it states that every firm is active in equilibrium, even\n15The term \ud454(0) is strictly negative: Since \ud43a(\ud45d) is strictly decreasing and continuously differentiable, we have\n\ud454(0) = lim\ud45d\u21980\ud43a\u2032(\ud45d) \u2264 0. Moreover, the convexity of \ud43a(\ud45d) rules out that \ud454(0) = 0 as otherwise \ud454(\ud45d) \u2265 0 for \ud45d > 0,\nviolating the assumption that \ud43a(\ud45d) is strictly decreasing. Finally, in the example \ud4631 > 0 (as otherwise firm 2\ncould not be inactive, but would be active at any weakly positive announcement), and so for firm 2 to be on the\nbrink of becoming active it has to be that \ud4632 > 0.\n24\nwhen all of its competitors offer the maximum individually rational utility.\nAssumption 3 \ud45d\ud457(v) > 0 for all \ud457 where v = (\ud4631, ..., \ud463\ud45a).\nIt is easy to show that Assumption 3 holds as long as the maximum utilities that firms are willing\nto offer are not too far apart, i.e. there exists parameter \ud6fe < 1 such that Assumption 3 holds\nwhenever min\ud457 \ud463\ud457 > \ud6femax\ud457 \ud463\ud457. Note that we only rely on Assumption 3 for the characterization\nproof of Section 4 and this assumption is not necessary for our other results.\nWe now prove that if a low productivity firm\u2019s first order conditions hold and it offers higher\nutility than a high productivity firm then the high productivity firm\u2019s first order conditions are\nnot satisfied. While our equilibrium definition focuses on pure strategies, note that it does not\nrestrict identical firms to offer the same utility to workers. This is one implication of the following\ntheorem which shows that in equilibrium a more productive firm necessarily offers higher utility\nto workers.\nTheorem 2 If Assumption 3 holds, then in any directed search equilibrium \ud463\ud457 > \ud463\ud458 if firm \ud457 is\nstrictly more productive than firm \ud458 and \ud463\ud457 = \ud463\ud458 if firm \ud457 is equally productive to firm \ud458.\nProof. See Appendix.\nWe now provide an example where Assumption 3 does not hold and there is an equilibrium\nwhere a high productivity firm offers a lower wage than a low productivity firm. We construct it\nin the canonical setting of the directed literature with linear production as outlined in Example\n1 in Section , which has been the focus e.g. in Moen (1997), Montgomery (1991) and Peters\n(2000). Since Assumption 3 holds when all firms are identical, and since it is easy to show\nthat with two firms and linear production the equilibrium is always characterized by first order\nconditions, we resort to an example which in the end features more than two firms and firm\nheterogeneity.\n25\nExample 1 To set up the example, consider first a simple environment with two risk-neutral\nworkers and two identical firms who produce 1 when matched and zero otherwise. The profit of\nfirm \ud457 is given by \ud70b\ud457(\ud463) = 1 \u2212 \ud463. It is straightforward to show that the unique directed search\nequilibrium has utility offers \ud4631 = \ud4632 = 1\/2 and expected utility for workers of \ud448(1\/2, 1\/2) = 3\/8.\nNow choose \ud716 > 0 and \ud705 > \ud716 such that at wage profile (\ud463\u02c61, \ud463\u02c62) = (1\/2 + \ud716, 1\/2 + \ud705) both\nfirms individually prefer to reduce their offers. Choose both \ud716 and \ud705 small enough such that the\nincentives to reduce the wage are small. These parameters exist due to the convexity of the firms\nbest response function. If the firms offer \ud463\u02c61 and \ud463\u02c62 then workers obtain some expected utility \ud448\u02c6 .\nNext, introduce a third firm with profit function \ud70b3 = \ud448\u02c6 \u2212 \ud463 that offers wage \ud463\u02c63 = \ud448\u02c6 . In\nthis extended environment none of the original firms has any longer an incentive to lower their\nutility offer since workers would start applying to the third firm (the function \ud45d\ud457(\ud463\ud457, \ud463\u2212\ud457) can be\nshown to be non-differentiable at v\u02c6 because firm 3 has a non-negligible impact). Therefore, in\nthe extended environment \ud463\u02c61, \ud463\u02c62 and \ud463\u02c63 constitutes an equilibrium, and the original two firms\npay different wages despite the fact that their profit functions are identical.\nBy standard upper-hemicontinuity arguments we can slightly improve the productivity of firm\n1 and obtain an equilibrium arbitrarily close to \ud463\u02c61, \ud463\u02c62 and \ud463\u02c63. Since \ud463\u02c61 < \ud463\u02c62 we end up with an\nequilibrium where the higher productivity firm posts a strictly lower utility. Note that the proof\ncrucially relies on the non-differentiability of the profit function at the equilibrium offers.\nExamples of this type can be constructed in any setting that fulfills our assumptions on\nproduction and matching. We can first look at the case where two firms have exactly identical\nand therefore announce the same value to the workers according to Theorem 2, then introduce\na third firm with productivity slightly above the announcement of the original firms and let it\noffer its full productivity, then adjust the announcements of the other firms upward slightly to\nset the third firm exactly at the point of becoming active and therefore none of the original firms\nwants to reduce its offers due to the resulting discontinuity,16 and finally since preferences are\n16In the absence of the third firm, it is easy to see for example from the proof of the following Theorem 3 that\nthe original firms would like to reduce their announcement if we increase it upward from the equilibrium level,\nso only the kink induced by the third firm holds them back.\n26\nstrict we can adjust the productivies of the original firms slightly to unequal levels.\nTheorem 2 holds when firms are homogeneous and it can be used to prove that there is a\nunique equilibrium in such a case. In the only related result, Burdett, Shi and Wright (2001)\nprove that there is only one equilibrium where all firms offer the same wage in an environment\nwith linear production and urn-ball matching. However, they do not examine asymmetric strate-\ngies by the (identical) firms, except for the special 2-firm 2-worker case. Our previous theorem\nestablishes that there cannot be equilibria in asymmetric strategies when firms are homogeneous\nand, therefore, the equilibrium in Burdett, Shi and Wright (2001) is unique. Our proof still\nincludes some additional steps to show that the result holds for general matching functions and\ngeneral production technologies.\nTheorem 3 When all firms are equally productive, the directed search equilibrium is unique.\nProof. See Appendix.\n5 Competitive Search as a Limit\nIn this section we present the standard one-shot version of a directed search economy with a\ncontinuum of agents under the market utility property and show that it is the limit of the finite\ngame as the number of agents becomes large. This setup encompasses the models described in\nSection 2.2. Our exposition is closely related to Peters (1997).\nConsider an economy with measure one of firms and measure \ud44f of workers. The workers\nare homogeneous and firms are potentially heterogeneous with types distributed on \u0398 = [0, 1]\naccording to probability measure \ud443 . When a firm of type \ud703 \u2208 \u0398 fills its vacancy and pays \ud463 to\nits worker it makes profits \ud70b\ud703(\ud463), where \ud70b\ud703 satisfies Assumption 1 and \ud463\u00af \u2261 sup\ud703\u2208\u0398 \ud463\u00af\ud703 <\u221e.\nThe timing of the model is the same as in the finite case: firms post announcements, workers\ndecide where to apply for a job, matching occurs and payoffs are realized. The workers\u2019 strategies\n27\nresult in an expected queue length \ud706 which represents the ratio of the expected number of\napplications per firm at each announcement level \ud463 and corresponds to \ud45b\ud45d\ud457 in the finite case.\nThe probability that a firm facing queue length \ud706 hires a worker is given by \ud45f\ud453 (\ud706) and the\nprobability that a worker who applies to such a firm finds a job is \ud45f\ud464(\ud706), where \ud45f\ud464(\ud706) = \ud45f\ud453 (\ud706)\/\ud706.\nAdditionally, \ud45f\ud453 is strictly increasing and concave, \ud45f\ud464 is strictly decreasing and convex and they\nare both twice continuously differentiable.\nThe queue length across different announcements is determined by the market utility property\nwhich is an indifference condition, similar to equation (1), stating that a worker receives at least\nthe market utility \ud448 when applying to a firm. An important additional element is that this\nrelation holds both on and off the equilibrium path, i.e. it determines a firm\u2019s hiring probability\nfrom offering some \ud463 that is not posted by anyone else:\nIf \ud463 > \ud448 then \ud706 is s.t. \ud45f\ud464(\ud706)\ud463 = \ud448 , otherwise \ud706 = 0. (11)\nAs in the finite case, an announcement that is too low (\ud463 \u2264 \ud448) receives no applicants (\ud706 = 0)\nand a firm is active only if \ud463 > \ud448 . Let \ud706(\ud463, \ud448) be the queue length defined by (11). Each firm\nanticipates this relation between the queue length and its announcement, and solves the problem\nmax\n\ud463\n\ud45f\ud453 (\ud706(\ud463, \ud448))\ud70b\ud703(\ud463) (12)\nDefinition 4 (Competitive Search Equilibrium) A competitive search equilibrium comprises\nthe workers\u2019 market utility \ud448\u2217 and a cumulative distribution of announcements \ud44c \u2217 such that for\nall intervals [\ud463\ud459, \ud463\u210e] \u2282 \u211d :\n\ud44c \u2217(\ud463\u210e)\u2212 \ud44c \u2217(\ud463\ud459) \u2264 \ud443{\ud703 \u2208 \u0398 : some \ud463 \u2208 (\ud463\ud459, \ud463\u210e] solves (12) for \ud703}, (13)\nand \u222b\n\ud706 (\ud463, \ud448\u2217) \ud451\ud44c \u2217(\ud463) = \ud44f. (14)\n28\nThe left hand side of equation (13) gives the equilibrium measure of offers in (\ud463\ud459, \ud463\u210e]. The\nright hand side gives the proportion of firms that find it optimal to make an announcement in\n(\ud463\ud459, \ud463\u210e]. If every firm has a unique announcement, then (13) holds with equality.\n17 Equation (14)\nensures that the worker-firm ratio integrated across all firms actually adds up to the measure of\nworkers in the economy. It ensures that the utility that the workers obtain indeed reflects their\nscarcity.\nFor some of the convergence results it is more useful to talk about a firm\u2019s rank in the\ndistribution. We define a firm as being of rank \ud465 \u2208 [0, 1] if a fraction \ud465 of other firms has\na weakly lower type. We can back out the actual type of the firm that has rank \ud465 as \ud70f(\ud465) =\nsup{\ud703 \u2208 \ud703\u2223\ud443 ([0, \ud703]) \u2264 \ud465}). Let \u03a0\u2217\ud465 denote the expected profit of a firm of rank \ud465 in the competitive\nequilibrium.\nWe will now explore the connection of this limit game to games of the finite economy that\nwe analyzed in Section 3. Consider a finite economy with \ud45a firms and \ud45b = \ud44f\ud45a identical workers.\nIn what follows, we index the variables that refer to the finite economy by \ud45a. We label firms\nin the finite economy by their rank in the productivity distribution, so that firm \ud457 is of rank\n\ud457\/\ud45a. Furthermore, we assume that the rank remains unchanged as the economy grow in that\nit coincides with that of firm of type \ud70f(\ud457\/\ud45a) in the limit economy. Therefore, by construction\nthe distribution of types in the finite economy converges weakly to the type distribution in the\nlimit economy. Theorem 1 proves that the finite economy has a pure strategy equilibrium. Let\n\ud44c\ud45a denote the distribution of announcements for that equilibrium, \ud448\ud45a the market utility of the\nworkers and \u03a0\ud45a,\ud465 the expected profit of firm \ud457 = \ud45a\ud465.\nIn the finite game we have some trading probabilities given by \ud43b(\ud45d) and \ud43a(\ud45d) when workers\napply with probability \ud45d to a firm, where \ud43b and \ud43a fulfill Assumption 2. The matching proba-\nbilities change when we increase the number of workers \ud45b, and to make this dependence obvious\n17In principle, a firm could earn maximum profits from several distinct announcements, which is why (13) has\na weak inequality. To see that (13) always holds with equality if each firm type has a unique optimum, observe\nthe following. If the inequality were strict for some interval [\ud463\ud459, \ud463\u210e] then for the union of [\ud463\ud459, \ud463\u210e] and [0, \ud463\u00af]\u2216[\ud463\ud459, \ud463\u210e]\nthe left hand side of (13) is 1 but the right hand side would have to add to more than 1, violating the requirement\nthat \ud443 is a probability measure.\n29\nwe can write \ud43b(\ud45b, \ud45d) and \ud43a(\ud45b, \ud45d).18 Intuitively, \ud45b\ud45d reflects the expected number of workers at\nthis firm. We will consider matching functions \ud45f\ud464 and \ud45f\ud453 that can be approached as the limits\nof \ud43b and \ud43a as \ud45b \u2192 \u221e keeping \ud45b\ud45d = \ud706. It is easy to see that any pair \ud45f\ud464 and \ud45f\ud453 that ful-\nfills Assumption 2 (when \ud45d is replaced by \ud706) can be approached by some sequence of functions\n\ud43b(\ud45b, \ud45d) and \ud43a(\ud45b, \ud45d) that fulfill Assumption 2. Since Assumption 2 is quite general, this includes\nmost matching functions that have been used in the literature. In particular, the limit matching\nfunctions of the examples in section 4 are included, which in particular rationalizes the following\ndifferent limit matching technologies that have both different levels and elasticities:\nExample M1 : \ud45f\ud453 (\ud706) = 1\u2212 \ud452\u2212\ud706 = lim\n\ud45b\u2192\u221e\u2223\ud45b\ud45d=\ud706\n1\u2212 (1\u2212 \ud45d)\ud45b;\nExample M2 : \ud45f\ud453 (\ud706) = 1\u2212 \ud452\u2212(1\u2212\ud70f)\ud706 = lim\n\ud45b\u2192\u221e\u2223\ud45b\ud45d=\ud706\n1\u2212 (1\u2212 \ud45d)\ud45b;\nExample M3 (for \ud45b\u00af = 2): \ud45f\ud453 (\ud706) = (1\u2212 \ud452\u2212\ud706 \u2212 \ud706\ud452\u2212\ud706)(1\u2212 \ud70f 2) + \ud706\ud452\u2212\ud706(1\u2212 \ud70f);\nFirst Example M4 : \ud45f\ud453 (\ud706) =\n\ud706\n\ud459 + \ud706\n= lim\n\ud45b\u2192\u221e\u2223\ud45b\ud45d=\ud706\n\ud45b\ud45d\n\ud459 + \ud45b\ud45d\n;\nSecond Example M4 : \ud45f\ud453 (\ud706) = (1 + \ud706\n\u2212\ud70e)\u22121\/\ud70e = lim\n\ud45b\u2192\u221e\u2223\ud45b\ud45d=\ud706\n(1 + (\ud45b\ud45d)\u2212\ud70e)\u22121\/\ud70e.\nWe will show that an allocation that can be supported for the limit of finite games constitutes\na competitive search equilibrium, and vice versa. The following result shows the payoffs of\nworkers and firms converge for large \ud45a to those in the limit economy, which implicitly means\nthat the equilibrium matching probabilities converge.\nTheorem 4 For any convergent subsequence of equilibria such that \ud44c\ud45a \u2192 \ud44c \u2217 there exists \ud448\u2217\nsuch that {\ud448\u2217, \ud44c \u2217} constitutes a competitive search equilibrium, and expected utilities converge\n(\ud448\ud45a \u2192 \ud448\u2217) as well as expected profits (\u03a0\ud45a,\ud465 \u2192 \u03a0\u2217\ud465). Conversely, for any competitive search\nequilibrium {\ud448\u2217, \ud44c \u2217} there exists a subsequence of equilibria such that \ud44c\ud45a \u2192 \ud44c \u2217, \ud448\ud45a \u2192 \ud448\u2217, and\n\u03a0\ud45a,\ud465 \u2192 \u03a0\u2217\ud465.\nProof.

Peters (1997, p. 256)\nlays out that his equivalence theorems extend directly to convergence of finite equilibria if the\nfinite equilibria exist in pure posting strategies (because in this case the equilibrium can be\nrepresented as a step function \ud44c\ud45a). Our Theorem 1 establishes such existence in pure posting\nstrategies.\n6 Conclusions\nIn this paper we consider finite directed search economies with heterogeneous firms, homogeneous\nworkers and general production and matching structures. We characterize the response by\nworkers to changes in the offers by firms and prove the existence of subgame perfect Nash\nequilibria in pure firm strategies. In addition to being interesting in its own right, this result\nis useful in a number of ways. Proving the convergence of finite equilibria to the continuum\neconomies becomes relatively straightforward (Section 5), showing that the competitive search\nmodels that have been considered in the literature have solid micro-foundations. Furthermore,\na more complete characterization of the equilibrium set is feasible (Section 4) and examining\nthe efficiency properties of the finite economy becomes easier (Galenianos, Kircher and Virag\n(2010), for the special case of linear production).\nA number of questions remain open for this class of models. The cardinality of the pure\nstrategy equilibrium set has not been characterized (especially as concerns uniqueness) while\nthe existence of non-degenerate mixed strategy equilibria has not been proved or disproved. A\ndifferent research direction would be to introduce heterogeneity on the worker side. With two-\nsided heterogeneity one can address questions regarding the sorting patterns between workers\nand firms. This question has been examined in continuum models by Shi (2001), Shimer (2005)\nand Eeckhout and Kircher (2010) but, to our knowledge, only Peters (2009) has made progress\n19The proofs in Peters (1997) work with the function \ud43b(\ud45b, \ud45d) = 1\u2212 (1\u2212 \ud45d)\ud45b, but straightforward replacement\nby the general functional form \ud43b(\ud45b, \ud45d) shows convergence for more general matching functions.\n31\nin analyzing a finite economy.20\nManolis Galenianos, Pennsylvania State University, USA.\nPhilipp Kircher, London School of Economics and Political Science, UK, and University of\nPennsylvania, USA.\n20Peters (2009) considers the game among heterogeneous workers for given wage offers by firms, while strategic\ndecisions of the firms are not analyzed for finite numbers.

To\ncalculate the determinant \u2223\ud437pF\u2223 we use Laplace\u2019s development to expand the last row and ob-\ntain \u2223\ud437pF\u2223 =\n\u2211\ud459\n\ud460=1 \u039b\ud459\ud460, where \u039b\ud459\ud460 is the cofactor to element \ud6fc\ud459\ud460. That is, \u039b\ud459\ud460 = (\u22121)\ud459+\ud460\u2223\ud444\ud459\ud460\u2223,\nwhere \ud444\ud459\ud460 is the matrix resulting from \ud437pF by elimination of the \ud459th row and the \ud460th col-\numn. Since \ud444\ud459\ud459 is a diagonal matrix we have \u2223\ud444\ud459\ud459\u2223 =\n\u220f\n\ud458\u2208\ud43f(v)\u2216{\ud459} \ud709\ud458(v). For \ud460 < \ud459 we expand\nthe \ud460 th row of \u2223\ud444\ud459\ud460\u2223 which yields \u2223\ud444\ud459\ud460\u2223 = (\u22121)\ud459\u22121+\ud460(\u2212\ud709\ud459(v))\u2223\ud435\ud459\ud460\u2223, where \ud435\ud459\ud460 is a (\ud459 \u2212 2)2 -\ndimensional diagonal matrix with diagonal elements \ud709\ud458(\ud464) for all \ud458 \u2208 \ud434(v)\u2216{\ud460, \ud459}. We therefore\nhave \u2223\ud444\ud459\ud460\u2223 = (\u22121)\ud459+\ud460\n\u220f\n\ud458\u2208\ud434(v)\u2216{\ud460} \ud709\ud458(v), which yields that \u2223\ud437pF\u2223 =\n\u2211\ud459\n\ud460=1\n\u220f\n\ud458\u2208\ud434(v)\u2216{\ud460} \ud709\ud458(v).\nNext, consider the matrix \ud437vp = \u2212(\ud437pF)\u22121\ud437vF of partial derivatives. As an implication\nof Cramer\u2019s Rule (\ud437pF)\n\u22121 = \u2223\ud437pF\u2223\u22121\ud436, where \ud436 is the matrix with elements \ud6fe\ud457\ud460 = \u039b\ud460\ud457. The\nJacobian with respect to the exogenous variables \ud437vF evaluated at (p(v),v) is simply a diag-\nonal matrix except for the last column, with elements \ud6fd\ud460\ud460 = \ud43a(\ud45d\ud460(v)) and \ud6fd\ud460\ud459 = \u2212\ud43a(\ud45d\ud459(v)) for\n\ud460 \u2208 {1, .., \ud459 \u2212 1} and zeros elsewhere. We therefore have \u2202\ud45d\ud457(v)\/\u2202\ud463\ud457 = \u2212\u039b\ud457\ud457\u2223\ud437pF\u2223\u22121\ud43a(\ud45d\ud457(v)).\nThis follows immediately for \ud457 \u2208 {1, .., \ud459 \u2212 1}, and holds for \ud457 = \ud459 by symmetry which is\ncumbersome but straightforward to verify analytically. Since the cofactor \u039b\ud457\ud457 has a simi-\nlar structure as the determinant \u2223\ud437pF\u2223 only with row and column \ud457 missing, we have \u039b\ud457\ud457 =\u2211\n\ud460\u2208\ud434(v)\u2216{\ud457}\n\u220f\n\ud458\u2208\ud434(v)\u2216{\ud457,\ud460} \ud709\ud458(v), and we obtain\n\u2202\ud45d\ud457(v)\n\u2202\ud463\ud457\n= \u2212\n\u2211\n\ud460\u2208\ud434(v)\u2216{\ud457}\n\u220f\n\ud458\u2208\ud434(v)\u2216{\ud457,\ud460} \ud709\ud458(v)\u2211\n\ud460\u2208\ud434(v)\n\u220f\n\ud458\u2208\ud434(v)\u2216{\ud460} \ud709\ud458(v)\n\ud43a(\ud45d\ud457(v)). (15)\nEquation (6) follows then from simple algebraic manipulations.\nLemma 3.\nProof. Fix v\u2212\ud457. We first consider \ud463\u02c6\ud457 \u2208 \u03a8\ud457(v\u2212\ud457), i.e. points where the workers reaction is not\n33\ndifferentiable. We have already established there is only a finite number of such points. At these\npoints the concavity of \ud45d\ud457(\ud463\ud457,v\u2212\ud457) follows trivially because a decrease in the announcement by\nfirm \ud457 increases other firms\u2019 expected number of applicants, while an increase does not. That\nis, by continuity of \ud45d\ud457(\u22c5), \ud709\ud457(\u22c5) and \ud43a(\u22c5) equation (15) implies that lim\ud463\ud457\u2197\ud463\u02c6\ud457 \u2202\ud45d\ud457(\ud463\ud457,v\u2212\ud457)\/\u2202\ud463\ud457 <\nlim\ud463\ud457\u2198\ud463\u02c6\ud457 \u2202\ud45d\ud457(\ud463\ud457,v\u2212\ud457)\/\u2202\ud463\ud457.\nThe remaining task is to show that \ud45d\ud457(\ud463\ud457,v\u2212\ud457) is strictly concave for \ud463\u02c6\ud457 \u2208 \u03a9\ud457(v\u2212\ud457). Recall\nthat \ud447\ud457(v) = \u2212\ud709\ud457(v) \u2212 \ud44b\ud457(v) where \ud44b\ud457(v) = 1\/\n\u2211\n\ud458\u2208\ud434(v)\u2216{\ud457}\n1\n\ud709\ud458(v)\n. We differentiate (15) with\nrespect to \ud463\ud457 to obtain the following:\n\u22022\ud45d\ud457\n\u2202\ud4632\ud457\n= \u2212 1\n\ud447 2\ud457\n(\n\ud454(\ud45d\ud457)\n\u2202\ud45d\ud457\n\u2202\ud463\ud457\n[\ud44b\ud457 + \ud463\ud457]\u2212\ud43a(\ud45d\ud457)\n[\n\ud454\u2032(\ud45d\ud457)\n\u2202\ud45d\ud457\n\u2202\ud463\ud457\n\ud463\ud457 + \ud454(\ud45d\ud457) +\n\u2202\ud44b\ud457\n\u2202\ud463\ud457\n])\n, (16)\nwhere v is omitted for brevity. We now show that (16) is strictly negative. We split the term in\nthe round bracket into three parts, \ud4351, \ud4352 and \ud4353, and show that each is non-negative.\nThe first part is given by \ud4351 = \ud454(\ud45d\ud457) [\u2202\ud45d\ud457\/\u2202\ud463\ud457] \ud44b\ud457 and it is strictly positive because \ud454(\ud45d\ud457)\nand \ud44b\ud457 are strictly negative. Part \ud4352 is given by\n\ud4352 = \ud454(\ud45d\ud457)\n\u2202\ud45d\ud457\n\u2202\ud463\ud457\n\ud463\ud457 \u2212 \ud43a(\ud45d\ud457)\n[\n\ud454\u2032(\ud45d\ud457)\n\u2202\ud45d\ud457\n\u2202\ud463\ud457\n\ud463\ud457 + \ud454(\ud45d\ud457)\n]\n.\nRearranging the above and using (15) yields\n\ud4352 = \ud43a(\ud45d\ud457)\ud463\ud457[2\ud454(\ud45d\ud457)\n2 \u2212 \ud454\u2032(\ud45d\ud457) \ud43a(\ud45d\ud457)] +\ud44b\ud457\ud454(\ud45d\ud457)\ud43a(\ud45d\ud457).\nThe last term is positive so we only need to show that term in the square bracket is positive,\nwhich holds exactly when 1\/\ud43a(\ud45d) is convex.\nFinally, consider \ud4353 = \u2212\ud43a(\ud45d\ud457)[\u2202\ud44b\ud457\/\u2202\ud463\ud457]. Note that\n\u2202\ud44b\ud457\n\u2202\ud463\ud457\n= \ud44b2\ud457\n[ \u2211\n\ud458\u2208\ud434(v)\u2216{\ud457}\n\ud454\u2032(\ud45d\ud458)\n\ud454(\ud45d\ud458)2\ud463\ud458\n\u2202\ud45d\ud458\n\u2202\ud463\ud457\n]\n,\n34\nSince \u2202\ud45d\ud458\/\u2202\ud463\ud457 \u2264 0 for \ud458 \u2215= \ud457 and \ud454\u2032(\ud45d\ud458) \u2265 0, due to the convexity of \ud43a(\ud45d), we have shown that\n\ud4353 is non-negative.\nTheorem 2.\nProof. Under Assumption 3, \ud434(v) = \ud440 and the announcement of every firm is characterized\nby its first order condition:\n\u2202\u03a0\ud457\n\u2202\ud463\ud457\n= \ud43b(\ud45d\ud457)\n\ud451\ud70b\ud457(\ud463\ud457)\n\ud451\ud463\ud457\n+ \u210e(\ud45d\ud457)\ud70b\ud457(\ud463\ud457)\n\u2202\ud45d\ud457\n\u2202\ud463\ud457\n= 0 \u2200 \ud457 \u2208\ud440. (17)\nFrom now on we focus on firms 1 and 2 without loss of generality. Let firm 1 be strictly\nmore productive than firm 2. The proof proceeds by contradiction. Assume \ud4631 \u2264 \ud4632 (the proof\nfor equal productivities and \ud4631 < \ud4632 is analogous). Under this assumption we will show that\n\u2202\u03a02\/\u2202\ud4632 = 0 and then \u2202\u03a01\/\u2202\ud4631 > 0, which contradicts profit maximization for firm 1 and proves\nthat \ud4631 > \ud4632 is a necessary condition for equilibrium.\nWe proceed by assuming \ud4631 \u2264 \ud4632. To compare the first order conditions of firms 1 and 2 we\ncan work with the following two sets of inequalities:\n\ud451\ud70b1(\ud4631)\n\ud451\ud4631\n\u2265 \ud451\ud70b2(\ud4631)\n\ud451\ud4632\n\u2265 \ud451\ud70b2(\ud4632)\n\ud451\ud4632\n, (18)\n\ud70b1(\ud4631) \u2265 \ud70b2(\ud4631) \u2265 \ud70b2(\ud4632). (19)\nThe first inequality of equations (18) and (19) is due to firm 1 being more productive and at least\none of them has to hold strictly (according to Definition 3). The second inequality of equation\n(18) is due to the (weak) concavity of \ud70b\ud457(\u22c5). The second inequality of equation (19) is due to the\nfact that \ud70b\ud457(\ud463\ud457) is decreasing in \ud463\ud457 in the relevant range.\nRearranging equation (17) yields\n\ud451\ud70b\ud457(\ud463\ud457)\n\ud451\ud463\ud457\n+\n\u210e(\ud45d\ud457)\n\ud43b(\ud45d\ud457)\n\u2202\ud45d\ud457\n\u2202\ud463\ud457\n\ud70b\ud457(\ud463\ud457) = 0. (20)\nIf the term multiplying \ud70b\ud457(\ud463\ud457) is higher for firm 1 than for firm 2, then the first derivative of firm\n35\n1 is strictly positive when \ud4631 \u2264 \ud4632 which proves our result. Using equation (6) we can rewrite:\n\u210e(\ud45d\ud457)\n\ud43b(\ud45d\ud457)\n\u2202\ud45d\ud457\n\u2202\ud463\ud457\n= \u2212 \u210e(\ud45d\ud457)\n\ud43b(\ud45d\ud457)\n\ud43a(\ud45d\ud457)\n\u2211\n\ud460\u2208\ud440\u2216{\ud457}\n\u220f\n\ud458\u2208\ud440\u2216{\ud457,\ud460} \ud709\ud458\u2211\n\ud460\u2208\ud440\n\u220f\n\ud458\u2208\ud440\u2216{\ud460} \ud709\ud458\n. (21)\nNote that the last term has the same denominator for all \ud457. Therefore we need only show that\n\u210e(\ud45d1)\ud43a(\ud45d1)\n\ud43b(\ud45d1)\n\u2211\n\ud460 \u2215=1\n\u220f\n\ud458 \u2215\u2208{1,\ud460}\n\u2223\ud454(\ud45d\ud458)\u2223\ud463\ud458 \u2265 \u210e(\ud45d2)\ud43a(\ud45d2)\n\ud43b(\ud45d2)\n\u2211\n\ud460 \u2215=2\n\u220f\n\ud458 \u2215\u2208{2,\ud460}\n\u2223\ud454(\ud45d\ud458)\u2223\ud463\ud458 (22)\nrecalling that \ud709\ud458 \u2261 \ud454(\ud45d\ud458)\ud463\ud458 and \ud454(\ud45d\ud458) < 0. The assumption that \ud4631 \u2264 \ud4632 implies \ud45d1 \u2264 \ud45d2\nand hence \u210e(\ud45d1 \u2265 \u210e(\ud45d2) , \ud43b(\ud45d1) \u2264 \ud43b(\ud45d2) and \ud43a(\ud45d1) \u2265 \ud43a(\ud45d2). The term\n\u220f\n\ud458\/\u2208{1,2} \u2223\ud454(\ud45d\ud458))\u2223\ud463\ud458 is\ncontained inside the summation in both sides of inequality (22). It is therefore sufficient to show:\n\u210e(\ud45d1)\ud43a(\ud45d1)\n\ud43b(\ud45d1)\n\u2223\ud454(\ud45d2)\u2223\ud4632 \u2265 \u210e(\ud45d2)\ud43a(\ud45d2)\n\ud43b(\ud45d2)\n\u2223\ud454(\ud45d1)\u2223\ud4631. (23)\nSubgame equilibrium implies that \ud4632\/\ud4631 = \ud43a(\ud45d1)\/\ud43a(\ud45d2)). Together with \ud43a(\ud45d\ud457) = \ud43b(\ud45d\ud457)\/(\ud45b\ud45d\ud457)\nand \u2223\ud454(\ud45d\ud457)\u2223 = [\ud43a(\ud45d\ud457) + \u210e(\ud45d\ud457)\/\ud45b]\/\ud45d, inequality (23) reduces to\n\ud43a(\ud45d2) + \u210e(\ud45d2)\/\ud45b\n\ud43a(\ud45d2)\u210e(\ud45d2)\/\ud45b\n\u2265 \ud43a(\ud45d1) + \u210e(\ud45d1)\/\ud45b\n\ud43a(\ud45d1)\u210e(\ud45d1)\/\ud45b\n.\nIf \ud445(\ud45d) \u2261 \ud43a(\ud45d)\u22121 + \ud45b\u210e(\ud45d)\u22121 is strictly increasing in \ud45d we have our result. Differentiation yields\n\ud445\u2032(\ud45d) = \u2212\ud43a(\ud45d)\u22122\ud454(\ud45d)\u2212\ud45b\u210e(\ud45d)\u22122\u210e\u2032(\ud45d) which is strictly positive for any \ud45d \u2208 (0, 1) because \u210e\u2032(\ud45d) \u2264 0\nand \ud454(\ud45d) < 0.\nTheorem 3.\nProof. When all firms are equally productive Assumption 3 holds and in equilibrium all firms\noffer the same level of utility by Theorem 2. As a result, \ud45d\ud457 = 1\/\ud45a for all \ud457 \u2208 \ud440 in all\npossible equilibria. Suppose there are two candidate equilibria \ud434 and \ud435 where firms offer \ud463\ud434\nand \ud463\ud435 > \ud463\ud434, respectively, and consider the firms\u2019 first order conditions. The terms \ud43b(\ud45d) and\n\u210e(\ud45d) are the same in both candidate equilibria. The concavity of the profit function implies that\n36\n\ud451\ud70b(\ud463\ud434)\/\ud451\ud463\ud434 \u2265 \ud451\ud70b(\ud463\ud435)\/\ud451\ud463\ud435. Profits are a decreasing function of offered utility in \ud4b1 which implies\nthat \ud70b(\ud463\ud434) > \ud70b(\ud463\ud435). Finally, \u2202\ud45d\ud457\/\u2202\ud463\ud434 > \u2202\ud45d\ud457\/\u2202\ud463\ud435 follows from equation (15): \ud43a(\ud45d) and \ud454(\ud45d) are\nthe same in both equilibria and \ud447\ud457(v\ud434) < \ud447\ud457(v\ud435).\n37\nReferences\n[1] Acemog\u02d8lu, D. and A.
