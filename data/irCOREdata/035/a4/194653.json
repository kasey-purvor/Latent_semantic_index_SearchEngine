Most studies have concentrated on scCO2\nbecause of the easily accessible critical constants, cost and\nlow toxicity, exemplified by the recent launch of a scCO2-based\ncommercial hydrogenation process by Thomas Swan.5 Whilst\nthe range of reactions evaluated in SCFs is large, the number\nof examples of asymmetric induction are few1\u20134 and these are\nvirtually all restricted to scCO2. Asymmetric hydrogenation of\na,b-unsaturated carboxylic acids by [Ru(OAc)2(BINAP)] in\nscCO2 was reported to afford low conversions and low\nenantioselectivities, although both the conversion and ee\u2019s\ncould be improved when the ligand was made more CO2-philic\nby saturating two of the naphthyl rings.6 Solubility in scCO2\ncan also be enhanced by the introduction of perfluoroalkyl\nsubstituents, for example in the 6,69-positions of the BINAP\nligand.7,8 However, we observed poor reactivity and enantio-\nselectivity in the hydrogenation of dimethyl itaconate in\nscCO2, which we have ascribed to the apolarity of the solvent.\n8\nWe,8 and others,6,9 have observed enhanced conversions and\nimproved enantioselectivities for such ruthenium-catalysed\nasymmetric hydrogenations in scCO2 by the addition of polar\nadditives, such as methanol. However, here we add a note of\ncaution since, under carefully controlled conditions, in our\nwork it appears that the reaction is essentially finished before\nthe conditions for scCO2 had been reached.\n8 Asymmetric\nhydrogenation of a-enamides with a cationic Rh-DuPHOS\ncatalyst has been made possible by using a highly fluorinated,\nCO2-philic anion,\n10 and a similar approach has been adopted\nfor the enantioselective hydrogenation of an imine with a\ncationic iridium catalyst.11 We have also shown that the\naddition of a highly fluorinated anion offers improvements\nin both reactivity and asymmetric induction in the asymmetric\nhydrogenation of dimethylitaconate with cationic rhodium\ncomplexes containing perfluoroalkylated monodentate\nphosphinite, phosphite and phosphoramidite ligands, but the\nresults are, at best, modest.12\nThese studies suggest that, for asymmetric hydrogenation at\nleast, the apolarity of scCO2 is a significant issue. However, we\nhave previously shown that some hydrofluorocarbon (HFC)\nfluids such as difluoromethane and 1,1,1,2 tetrafluoroethane\n(HFC 134a) are relatively polar solvents,13\u201315 even in the sc\nstate, and this allows them to be used as efficient extraction\nsolvents either on their own or in conjunction with CO2.\n16,17\nFurthermore, these solvents are also readily available and non-\ntoxic. They have easily accessible critical constants (HFC 134a\nTc 5 374.1 K; pc 5 40.6 bar and CH2F2 Tc 5 351.1 K;\npc 5 57.8 bar), gaseous dipole moments of about 2 D\n15\nand very high densities in the sc state. HFCs have been\nproposed as useful solvents for synthesis in the sc state and we\nhave recently shown the first examples of the use of CH2F2 for\nthe radical polymerisation of methylmethacrylate,18 the\nFriedel Crafts alkylation of anisole19 and the esterification of\nbenzoic acid.20 Here, we report our results using sc HFC 134a\nas a convenient, environmentally benign solvent, for enantio-\nselective hydrogenation.\nResults and discussion\nThe study took two parts. Initially, Wilkinson\u2019s catalyst was\nused for the homogeneous hydrogenation of styrene, as a test\nreaction, to establish catalytic protocols and the viability of\nHFC 134a as a solvent for hydrogenation. Subsequently,\nenantioselective hydrogenation in HFC 134a was evaluated\nusing a rhodium\/MonoPhos catalyst generated in situ.\nWilkinson\u2019s catalysts have often been used as model systems\nfor the homogeneous hydrogenation of alkenes in liquid\nsolvents21\u201323 and hence it was initially used for the hydro-\ngenation of styrene in sc HFC 134a. Although the solubility of\n[RhCl(PPh3)3] in HFC 134a could not be measured quantita-\ntively, a visual inspection using the cell shown in Fig. 1 showed\nthat fully homogeneous solutions of Wilkinson\u2019s catalyst in\nHFC 134a up to 3 6 1023 M, at 383 K in the pressure range of\n50\u2013280 bar, could be readily prepared. In marked contrast, a\nsimilar experiment using 1.3 6 1023 mol dm23 [RhCl(PPh3)3]\nin CO2 at 313 K in the pressure range 50\u2013120 bar did not show\nany evidence of catalyst dissolution.

The results are shown in Fig. 2. It can be seen\nthat the reaction reached maximum conversion after 1.75 h\nand, therefore, subsequent hydrogenation reactions were\ncarried out for 2 h to ensure that the reaction had gone to\ncompletion. The time dependency results are generally the\naverage of at least two determinations and a reproducibility of\n\u00a13% was obtained. Analysis of the data in Fig. 2 yields a\nreaction rate of 167\u00a1 5 mmol dm21 h21 which is comparable\nto that reported for the hydrogenation of styrene in toluene.23\nThe pressure dependency of the hydrogenation of styrene at\n383 K was also investigated and the results are shown in Fig. 3.\nThe results had a reproducibility of \u00a13% and the change in\ndielectric constant with pressure for the pure HFC 134a\nsolvent at 383 K is also shown.15 Reactions were carried out at\nconstant mole fraction in order to observe the effect of\npressure on the % conversion and rule out the possibility of\ndilution effects as pressure is increased. The mole fractions\nused are the same as those used in the time dependency study\nat 383 K and 100 bar (Fig. 2). It can be seen that the %\nconversion increases with increasing pressure and this is\nattributed to the higher dielectric constant of HFC 134a at\nhigher pressures. It was suggested by Wilkinson et al.21,22 that\nthe rate determining step for the hydrogenation of olefins\ninvolves the formation of an activated complex, which has a\ngreater dipole moment than the reacting species and that some\ncharge separation is occurring during the formation of the\nFig. 1 Schematic diagram of the high-pressure apparatus used in this work.\nFig. 2 Time dependency of the hydrogenation of styrene in HFC\n134 using 2.20 6 1026 mol dm23 of [RhCl(PPh3)3] and 0.57 mol dm\n23\nof hydrogen at 383 K and 100 bar total pressure.\nFig. 3 Pressure dependency of the hydrogenation of styrene using\n[RhCl(PPh3)3] in HFC 134a at constant mole fraction and 383 K.\n722 | Green Chem., 2005, 7, 721\u2013725 This journal is \u0001 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2005\nPu\nbl\nish\ned\n o\nn \n02\n S\nep\nte\nm\nbe\nr 2\n00\n5.\n D\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n U\nni\nve\nrs\nity\n o\nf L\nei\nce\nste\nr o\nn \n19\n\/0\n8\/\n20\n13\n 1\n5:\n41\n:2\n8.\n \nView Article Online\nactivated intermediate. The formation of such an activated\ncomplex is likely to be more favourable in more polar solvents\nand is, therefore, more favourable in HFC 134a at higher\npressures (higher dielectric constant).\nThis initial study, the first to use HFC 134a as a reaction\nmedium, demonstrates that both catalytic species and\nsubstrates have sufficient solubilities without modification\nto afford homogeneous hydrogenation conditions, and that\nreactions rates comparable to those in liquid solvents can be\nobtained.\nThe asymmetric hydrogenation studies in sc HFC 134a were\nperformed using [Rh(COD)2BF4] {bis(1,5-cyclo-octadiene)-\nrhodium(I) tetrafluoroborate} as the catalyst precursor and\nthe monodentate (R)-MonoPhos ligand in a 1 : 2 ratio.\nMonoPhos, an air- and moisture-stable species, is easily\nprepared from readily available starting materials and it has\nbeen shown that it can facilitate highly enantioselective\nrhodium-catalysed hydrogenations in conventional solvent\nsystems,24,25 whilst BF4 electrolytes have been shown to be\nhighly soluble and extensively dissociated in HFC 134a,26,27\nmaking such a rhodium\/MonoPhos catalyst ideal for investi-\ngating asymmetric hydrogenation in sc HFC 134a. Reactions\nwere carried out using itaconic acid, dimethyl itaconate and\n(Z)-a-acetamido-cinnamic acid (1a, 2a and 3a respectively in\nScheme 1) as model substrates. Prior to the catalytic studies in\nHFC 134a, we benchmarked the rhodium\/(R)-MonoPhos\ncatalytic system and our methodology in the hydrogenation\nof 1a\u20133a in conventional organic solvents, where conversions\nand enantioselectivities very similar to those reported pre-\nviously were obtained.28\nIn HFC 134a hydrogenations were carried out at 383 K\nunder a variety of pressures at constant mole fraction, so that\ndilution effects could be ruled out and the results are shown in\nFig. 4 and 5. The results shown for the pressure dependency\nhad a reproducibility of \u00a14% whereas those for the enantio-\nselectivity have a larger error of \u00a18%. It can be seen from\nFig. 4 that the % conversion during the asymmetric hydro-\ngenation reactions shows a similar dependence on pressure as\nthose seen for styrene using [RhCl(PPh3)3] in Fig. 3 and the\nsame reasoning is offered to explain these trends. For\nconversions less than 100% it can be seen that the trend\nfollows the order 1a . 2a . 3a for a given pressure. One\npossible hypothesis for these observations is that there are two\nconflicting influences acting during the reaction; a negative\nsteric effect and the positive effect of increasing dielectric\nconstant. At lower pressures it is suggested that the reaction is\nunder steric control and steric factors are hindering olefinic\nbinding to the rhodium metal centre. The steric hindrance\naround the position of unsaturation for each substrate follows\nthe trend 1a , 2a , 3a. At higher pressures the dielectric\nconstant becomes the influencing factor and the % conversion\nincreases to its maximum value of 100%.\nIn contrast to our studies on asymmetric hydrogenation in\nscCO2,\n8 the enantioselectivities for the hydrogenation of 1a\u20133a\nin HFC 134a (Fig. 5) are comparable to some of those\nobtained in liquid solvents, which suggests that HFCs are\npromising alternative solvents for asymmetric hydrogenation\nof olefinic substrates. Within experimental error the enantio-\nselectivities at constant mole fraction show no dependency on\npressure and, therefore, no dependency on the dielectric\nconstant of HFC 134a. These results are consistent with those\nof de Vries and co-workers28 who carried out solvent screening\nstudies with the rhodium\/MonoPhos catalyst using the methyl\nester of (Z)-a-acetamido-cinnamic acid and found that % eeScheme 1 Reactions studied for asymmetric hydrogenation.\nFig. 4 Pressure dependency of % conversion for the asymmetric\nhydrogenation of substrates 1a\u20133a in HFC 134a at 383 K.\nFig. 5 Pressure dependency of enantiomeric excess for products\n1b\u20133b in HFC 134a at 383 K.\nThis journal is \u0001 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2005 Green Chem., 2005, 7, 721\u2013725 | 723\nPu\nbl\nish\ned\n o\nn \n02\n S\nep\nte\nm\nbe\nr 2\n00\n5.\n D\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n U\nni\nve\nrs\nity\n o\nf L\nei\nce\nste\nr o\nn \n19\n\/0\n8\/\n20\n13\n 1\n5:\n41\n:2\n8.\n \nView Article Online\nvaried from 70 (methanol) to 95 (DCM) It was concluded that\nnon-protic solvents lead to higher enantioselectivities than\nprotic ones and that the effect of solvent polarity could be\nruled out.\nIt is well known that the concentration of hydrogen can have\nan effect on the enantioselectivity during asymmetric hydro-\ngenation.29 Here, it was found that the % ee remained roughly\nconstant at 89 \u00a1 2%, in the hydrogenation of 1a at 383 K\nand 100 bar total, by varying the initial hydrogen pressure\nfrom 2 to 20 bar. These results complement those obtained\nusing conventional organic solvents employing rhodium\/\nMonoPhos24,25,28 and rhodium\/MonoPhos-based30 catalysts\nthat have illustrated that the hydrogen pressure has no effect\non enantioselectivity, and suggest that the mechanism of\nrhodium\/MonoPhos catalysis is the same in sc fluids as in\nliquid solvents.\nA study by Poliakoff et al.31 showed that the critical\nparameters of CO2 were reduced during the hydrogenation of\npropane as the ratios of reagents to products changed. Here,\na-acetamido-cinnamic acid was used as the substrate in a\nqualitative set of experiments to investigate the phase\nbehaviour of the HFC 134a hydrogenation system. A wind-\nowed vessel was loaded with the same concentration amounts\nof 3a and catalyst used for the asymmetric hydrogenation\nreactions and the system was pressurised with HFC 134a. This\nprocess was repeated twice more using the same concentration\namount of catalytic material but with a 50\/50 substrate\/\nproduct mixture and with product alone (emulating the\nreaction going to completion). It was found from these\ninvestigations that, at 383 K, the lowest pressure at which\nmulti-phase behaviour was observed was around 35\u201338 bar,\nwhich is a small reduction on the critical pressure of pure HFC\n134a (40.59 bar). Above 38 bar and throughout the pressure\ndependency studies (Fig. 4) the system was in a single\nhomogeneous phase.\nConclusion\nThis work has shown the first example of a reaction in sc\nHFC 134a. It has been demonstrated that homogeneous\ncatalysts can be used for hydrogenation reactions without the\nneed for co-solvents or fluorous ponytails. The hydrogenation\nof styrene with Wilkinson\u2019s catalyst was used as a model\nsystem and it was found that reaction rates comparable to, and\nin some cases higher than, those in liquid solvents were\nobtained. The high reaction rates are attributed to the higher\ndiffusivity of gaseous hydrogen in the supercritical media\nwhen compared to that in liquid solvents and the percentage\nconversion is dependent on the solvent dielectric constant,\nwhich can be tuned by manipulating the HFC 134a system\npressure.\nHigh conversions and enantioselectivities have been obtained\nfor the asymmetric hydrogenation of a range of substrates\nusing a rhodium-MonoPhos catalyst in HFC 134a, which\nsuggests that HFCs are promising alternatives as reaction\nmedia for the industrially important asymmetric hydrogena-\ntion process. We have recently shown that methylsuccinic\nacid (1b) and itaconic acid (1a) have significantly different\nsolubilities in HFC 134a and that this has been used to\ndevelop an ideal supercritical fluid extraction process, for the\nseparation of reagents and products, using a counter-current\nseparating column.32 This, coupled with the high solubility\nof catalysts and reagents, suggests that HFC 134a is a\nuseful alternative to CO2 as solvent for reactions in the\nsupercritical state.\nExperimental\n(R-)MonoPhos was prepared by the literature route,33 and all\nother reagents\/products were commercial samples and used as\nreceived.\nThe high-pressure cells were constructed from 316 stainless\nsteel and were heated using 240 V, 250 W band heaters\nsupplied by Walton Ltd. The temperature was controlled and\nmaintained (\u00a10.5 K) using CAL 9900 heater\/controllers\nfitted with an iron\/constantan thermocouple, the tip of which\nwas in contact with the solvent close to the centre of the cell.\nThe high-pressure seals between the body of the cells and the\ncell tops were provided by Teflon1 supported, standard nitrile\no-rings. The cells had 3 cm thick walls, a maximum working\npressure of 1 kbar and were rated to 1.5 kbar. Each high-\npressure system was fitted with pressure relief valves set\nto 300 bar for safety. Pressure was applied using a Thar\nTechnologies P-Series piston pump filled with polytetrafluoro-\nethane (PTFE) composite seals in order to accommodate the\nuse of hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) solvents.\nThe high-pressure system used for the hydrogenation work\nis shown schematically in Fig. 1. The catalyst-loading chamber\nis a 3 6 0.3 cm length of stainless steel pipe sealed at each end\nby a valve. V1 is a two-way needle valve and V2 is a two-way\nball valve with a polychlorotrifluoroethylene (PCTFE) seat.\nThe substrate was placed into the reaction vessel and the\ncatalyst was loaded into the catalyst-loading chamber. In the\ncase of air- and moisture-sensitive catalysts the chamber was\nloaded in a glove box and sealed under nitrogen using V1 and\nV2. The cell was heated to the desired temperature and\nevacuated to ensure the reaction vessel was air- and moisture-\nfree. The vessel was charged with the required amount of\nhydrogen and then pressurised with the appropriate solvent\nusing the P-Series piston pump. The solvent gas was passed\nthrough the catalyst-loading chamber, which flushed the\ncatalyst into the reaction vessel, thus starting the reaction.\nWhen using HFC solvents, cooling was applied before the gas\nentered the pump because the pump is more efficient at\npumping liquids. The reaction was left for the desired amount\nof time and the products\/unreacted starting materials were\ncollected by depressurisation into the larger volume collection\nvessel. The products were analysed using NMR (DPX 300),\nGC-MS (Perkin Elmer) and GC (Perkin Elmer Autosystem\nXL controlled by Turbochrom software). The enantiomeric\nexcess values for the hydrogenation of dimethyl itaconate and\na-acetamido-cinnamic acid were determined by GC using a\nChiraldex B-DM column. The enantiomeric excess values\nfor the hydrogenation of itaconic acid were determined\nusing polarimetry. Absolute configurations for the itaconic\nacid and dimethyl itaconate hydrogenation products (methyl-\nsuccinic acid and dimethyl succinate) were determined by\ncomparison with commercially available enantiomerically pure\n724 | Green Chem., 2005, 7, 721\u2013725 This journal is \u0001 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2005\nPu\nbl\nish\ned\n o\nn \n02\n S\nep\nte\nm\nbe\nr 2\n00\n5.\n D\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n U\nni\nve\nrs\nity\n o\nf L\nei\nce\nste\nr o\nn \n19\n\/0\n8\/\n20\n13\n 1\n5:\n41\n:2\n8.\n \nView Article Online\nproducts and that for acetylalanine, was determined using GC\nliterature data.34\nThe reagent amounts for the constant mole fraction\nasymmetric hydrogenation studies were 8.25 6 1025 mol of\nsubstrate and MonoPhos, 4.13 6 1027 mol of Rh(COD)2BF4\nand 1.65 6 1024 mol of H2 gas for reactions conditions of\n100 bar and 383 K.
