Such heterogeneity makes\nconducting large-scale wide-area exper-\niments extremely difficult\u2014most re-\nsearchers choose instead to construct\ntheir own ubiquitous computing envi-\nronment within which they can run their\nexperiments. This heterogeneity makes\nthe basic vision of ubiquitous computing\ndifficult to realize because interworking\nbetween components at different sites\nisn\u2019t possible.\nOne suggestion is that Grid technolo-\ngies1will make an ideal starting point for\ndeveloping future infrastructure support\nfor ubiquitous computing, facilitating the\ndeployment of ubiquitous computing\ntechnologies and helping to accelerate\nprogress toward Weiser\u2019s vision. \nFORMING AN ALLIANCE\nThe Grid promises a world where\naccess to computational resources across\ninstitutional boundaries is standardized,\nuniform, inexpensive, ubiquitous, and\nreliable. The Grid is often seen as a plat-\nform for networking large computational\nresources to help execute demanding sci-\nentific experiments. Over time, however,\nthe Grid has moved away from the mere\nsharing of computational resources and\nhas become a more generic platform for\nsharing any kind of networked resource. \nAlthough the Grid vision\u2019s origins\nmight not exactly match those of ubiq-\nuitous computing, we can identify many\ncommon elements.2 For example, both\nthe Grid and ubiquitous computing\nrequire solving problems associated\nwith large-scale deployment, resource\nmanagement, billing and accounting,\nand interface standardization.In 2003,\nwe began the process of establishing a\nGlobal Grid Forum (GGF) Research\nGroup called Ubicomp-RG to explore\nthese synergies between ubiquitous\ncomputing and the Grid. \nFor those unfamiliar with the stan-\ndardization process that the Grid com-\nmunity employs, the GGF is the Grid\ncommunity\u2019s equivalent of the IETF\/\nIRTF (Internet Engineering and Inter-\nnet Research Task Forces)\u2014it provides\na framework for researching and stan-\ndardizing all aspects of the Grid. GGF\nResearch Groups are typically charged\nwith conducting preparatory work in a\nnew or emerging area prior to forming\na working group to oversee standardi-\nzation in the area. \nThe proposed Ubicomp-RG will fo-\ncus on using Grid technologies both as\na means to interconnect existing and\nemerging ubiquitous computing envi-\nronments and as a core underlying tech-\nnology for developing and deploying\nnew ubiquitous computing systems. The\ngroup will produce a series of GGF doc-\numents that focus on using individual\nGrid technologies in this new domain.\nWhere applicable, we hope that the rec-\nommendations will form the basis of\nfuture tasks for GGF working groups in\nrelevant areas. An important goal will\nbe to encourage participation from both\nGrid and ubiquitous computing re-\nsearchers to help exploit the synergy be-\ntween these two areas. To this end, we\nhave promoted the group in both the\nGrid and the ubiquitous computing re-\nsearch communities. \nENGAGING THE GRID AND\nUBICOMP COMMUNITIES\nTo date, two GGF Birds of a Feather\n(BoF) sessions have been organized on\nthis topic\u2014one at GGF9 (held in Octo-\nber 2003 in Chicago) and the other at\nGGF10 (held in March 2004 in Berlin).\nApproximately 30 to 40 participants\nhave attended each event, leading to the\ndevelopment of a proposed charter for\nthe group, a Web site (http:\/\/ubigrid.\nlancs.ac.uk), and a mailing list (see the\nWeb site for subscription information). \nHowever, although attendance has\nbeen fairly high and many delegates have\nexpressed an interest in exploiting ubiq-\nuitous computing as either a source of\ndata or an output medium, there has\nbeen less interest from the Grid commu-\nnity in actively contributing to the Re-\nsearch Group in its current form. Indeed,\nthe only real synergy with other Grid\narchitecture activities that we have iden-\ntified is within the Peer-to-Peer Research\nGroup, which is looking at service dis-\ncovery in ad hoc environments. \nPart of the problem might be that\nExploring the Grid\u2019s Potential\nfor Ubiquitous Computing\nNigel Davies, Adrian Friday, and Oliver Storz\nHorizons\n74 PERVASIVEcomputing Published by the IEEE CS and IEEE ComSoc \u25a0 1536-1268\/04\/$20.00 \u00a9 2004 IEEEmost people attending the BOF sessions\nhave been relatively unfamiliar with the\nvision of ubiquitous computing. As re-\nsearchers in the field, we often forget\nhow revolutionary Weiser\u2019s vision still\nappears to many other computer sci-\nentists. It seems that to effectively en-\ngage the Grid communities, we must\noffer ubiquitous computing as a solu-\ntion to current Grid problems rather\nthan as a new application domain for\nthe Grid. Thus, the challenge becomes\none of identifying ubiquitous comput-\ning technologies that can enhance the\nGrid and drive any requirements for\nGrid extensions, which could then sup-\nport more general ubiquitous comput-\ning applications. \nWe have also started promoting the\nResearch Group in the ubiquitous com-\nputing community\u2014specifically, we pub-\nlished \u201cTowards \u2018Ubiquitous\u2019 Ubiquitous\nComputing: An Alliance with \u2018The\nGrid\u2019\u201d at Ubisys 2003.2We hope to con-\ntinue this work with further articles such\nas this one and publications and posters\nat future ubiquitous computing events. \nWe are actively seeking researchers\nfrom either community interested in\nhelping to establish Ubicomp-RG. Once\nwe\u2019ve established a core set of group\nmembers, we\u2019ll work to obtain GGF\napproval. We expect to produce a first\nset of recommendations within a year of\ngetting approval.
