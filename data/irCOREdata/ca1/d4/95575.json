The \npaper draws on a research study funded by the ESRC\u2019s Identities and Social Action research programme \n(RES-148-25-0053). \n \n \n1 \n \n \nIntroduction \n \nOn a recent train journey into central London, I heard a middle-class white woman admonishing an \nEastern European woman for speaking loudly on her mobile phone. Shortly after, a black woman \nangrily pushed past the Eastern European woman, muttering something under her breath. I was \nreminded of another journey on a No. 36 bus in the early 1980s. Another middle class-sounding white \nwoman complained to other passengers about a young black man listening to loud music on his \nWalkman. She said - the comment always having stayed with me \u2013 \u201cI am fed up with being a second \nclass citizen in my own country\u201d. Her words exposed her categorisation of him (and me) as \u2018different\u2019, \nand encircled her in an exclusionary zone of bounded white Britishness and implied superiority. Jump \nforward to 2007, and my train \u2018drama\u2019 has the same plot and dialogue \u2013 ethnicity, racism, class, culture \nand hierarchy \u2013 although the parts are taken by different (ethnic) actors. Both incidents caused me to \nfeel discomfort and despair that such interactions are so often framed by notions of racial\/ethnic \nhierarchy imbued with a class dimension where the ranking of those who are white, English, and \nmiddle class is forever higher than those of other ethnicities and class positions. However, there is also \nevidence of shifting identity dynamics in late modern Britain. The Eastern European woman was \n\u2018racially\u2019 white, and the indignation shown by the black woman was indicative of a shared hostility \nbetween white and black residents towards the newer white and minority ethnic groups in Britain. \nThese two experiences, twenty years apart, lead me to a personal and intellectual question. What role \ndoes racism play in early 21st century British society?  Can we see continuity or variation in \ncontemporary accounts of ethnic relations which have been shaped by Britain\u2019s imperial past (Gilroy \n2004)?  \n \nThis story about the trials of public transport is intended to introduce the key strands of this paper. The \nlate modern prison is used as a(n equally crowded) site for exploring individual and collective narratives \nof ethnicity, racialisation, racism, and exclusion, within the context of \u2018prisoner society\u2019. The first part \nof the paper situates this empirical study within the theoretical field of prison sociology. Next, I discuss \n2 \n \n \nkey analytic themes from the study, centring on how racial, ethnic, religious and national difference is \nexperienced, negotiated, and contested by prisoners, in complex and sometimes contradictory ways. I \nthen explore the significance of area-based local identification to prisoner solidarities. The paper \nconcludes - within the constraints of using a single case study to reflect on broad theory - with a \nconsideration of the implications of the research for a more nuanced and empirically-grounded \ntheoretical criminology.  \nIndigenous and Importation Models \n \nTwo contrasting models of prisoner identity and social relations exist within the sociology of prisons \nliterature. The \u2018indigenous model\u2019, proposed by Sykes (1958), and developed in the work of Goffman \n(1961), sees the \u2018pains of imprisonment\u2019 \u2013 the deprivation of liberty, goods and services, heterosexual \nrelationships, autonomy and security \u2013 and societal rejection of criminals as features which unify \nprisoners and require their interdependency. Emotionally brutalized by the deprivations and ritualised \ndegradation of incarceration, prisoners\u2019 fragile sense of self leads them to invest in a collective identity \ncharacterized by internal solidarity that stands opposed to the prison regime and its custodians (cf. \nClemmer 1958). The social roles prisoners adopted outside prison are set aside, as prisoners succumb \nto \u2018a recoding of existence\u2019 (Foucault 1979: 236). Demonstrating agency, nonetheless, prisoners develop \na normative \u2018inmate code\u2019 of values which governs social relations within the prison so as to maximize \npersonal security and counteract isolation (Sykes and Messinger 1960).  \n  \nIn sharp contrast, the \u2018importation model\u2019 emphasizes the influence of external statuses and behaviour \npatterns on prisoner subcultures (see Cressey and Irwin 1962).  Jacobs\u2019 (1979: 8) review, for example, \nregarded racial and ethnic cleavages as defining features of US prisons, subsuming the collective \nidentity of prisoner, with white and black inmates instead living in \u2018separate conflict-ridden social \nworlds\u2019 (see also Bartollas et al. 1976; Jacobs 1977). Race was seen as structuring social hierarchies, the \ninformal economy, religious activities and prisoner relations, largely through the collective opposition \n3 \n \n \nof Black Muslim prisoners that held sway at the time. Such racial and ethnic divisions have persisted in \nUS prisons, sometimes represented through gang or religious affiliations, with high levels of self-\nsegregation, mistrust and hostility (Diaz-Cotto 1996). Wacquant (2001) has even argued that the new \n\u2018master status trait\u2019 for prisoners is racial affiliation, with no space for inmate loyalty as a generic class. \nSocial relations are no longer determined by a normative code of prisoner solidarity against prison \nofficers, as the racialized \u2018street code\u2019 epitomized by hypermasculinist notions of honour, respect and \ntoughness reigns, with a blurring of the boundaries between prison and ghetto. A synthesis position, \nborne through much empirical research, however, has recognized like Jacobs (1979: 21) that \u2018[I]t is \npossible both to speak of prisoners as a class or group and, at the same time, to recognize this class to \nbe internally fragmented.\u2019  \n \nIn the UK, qualitative prison studies have illuminated our understanding of masculinities, social order, \npower, adaptation and resistance in prison (Sparks et al. 1996; Jewkes 2002; Crewe 2007), but these \nstudies have not fully interrogated issues of ethnicity and racisms among prisoners. Crewe 's (2006) \nethnography of Wellingborough prison has considered ethnicity and heroin-dealing, but it is Genders \nand Player 's (1989) now dated work which remains the most comprehensive study of race relations in \nprisons. It describes primarily same-race solidarities within three prisons, with a racially stratified social \nhierarchy in one institution, headed by white professional \u2018gangsters\u2019, with black and \u2018terrorist \nprisoners\u2019 in the middle echelons and sex offenders at the bottom of the hierarchy. Bosworth 's (1999) \nanalysis of women\u2019s prisons takes this work forward, exploring how intersecting identities of race, \nethnicity, gender, and class, provide a mechanism for resisting institutional power and control, whilst \nWilson (2003) found strong black prisoner solidarity in response to the racialised power dynamics of a \nyoung offenders\u2019 institution.  \n \nThe Current Study \nThe current research builds on the work of Bosworth (1999), using a micro-level approach to \nunderstand the influence of identity positions on social relations between prisoners. It examines how the \n4 \n \n \n                                                \nconstruction and negotiation of ethnic and masculine identities are enacted in prison life, and how they \nintersect with faith, nationality, and locality at the individual and collective level. In so doing, it \nconnects with sociological understandings of the social organisation of ethnic difference and ethnicised \nboundary-setting, particularly within youth cultures. Reflecting the postmodern turn, sociologists have \nincreasingly turned their attention to recognising cultural hybridity, the popular symbolism of black \ncultural practices, and varying configurations of whiteness (see for example Back 1996; Frosh et al. \n2002; Nayak 2005), all of which have relevance for those incarcerated in the UK\u2019s culturally diverse \nprison estate. \n \nThe current project is a two site study carried out in Kent, a county in the South-East of England. At \nthe time of writing, fieldwork was ongoing in HMP Maidstone, a Category C prison for adult men. This \npaper is based on the initial findings from HMPYOI Rochester, a prison for young men aged 18-21 \nyears. The Young Offenders\u2019 Institution is located just beyond the M25 London orbital motorway in \nthe \u2018garden of England\u2019, nestled within idyllic and quintessentially English rolling countryside. The \nsemi-rural environment and predominantly white population is distinctively different from the multi-\nethnic London urban and suburban neighbourhoods where many prisoners are drawn from.  The \nresearch has an ethnographic orientation, involving informal conversation with prisoners, observing the \nroutines and rhythms of their lives, paying attention to what may appear as trivial or mundane \ninteraction, and interviewing them about their experiences and understandings of identity. The \nfieldwork1 consisted of 575 hours spent at the prison between July 2006 and February 2007. Semi-\nstructured, in-depth interviews with 35 informal contacts and 25 randomly sampled prisoners were \nconducted, broadly representing the ethnic origin (56% white, 44% minority ethnic), religion, and \n \n \n \n \n1 The bulk of the fieldwork and two-thirds of the interviews were carried out by Rod Earle. I am indebted to him for this \nphysically and emotionally demanding work.  \n5 \n \n \n                                                \nnationality of the Rochester population2. Fieldnotes and interview data were thematically coded in QSR \nNVIVO.7.  \nLiving Diversity in the Prison \n \nLate modern prisons are characterised by ethnic, national, and religious diversity (Home Office 2005). \nA primary objective of this research study has been to explore how what Amin (2002: 959) has termed \n\u2018local liveability\u2019 and the \u2018daily negotiation of ethnic difference\u2019 is managed within the emotionally \nfraught and confined world of the prison. It is perhaps not at all surprising then, that many prisoners at \nRochester were, at a surface level at least, accepting of difference in prison life. Their accounts \nacknowledged the reality of diversity, and racial and ethnic difference was rendered unremarkable and \nunexceptional. A White British national prisoner, for example, commented, \u2018\u2026with like fifty of us \nthat\u2019s been on this wing for ages, we all know each other, it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re black, white, \nIndian\u2026you\u2019d all be together\u20193. Similarly, from an Asian Muslim prisoner,4 \u2018Ethnicity is not really a big \nthing\u2026nobody takes it as a main mark.  It\u2019s more on the lines of who you are personally. Not your race \nas an individual, exactly.\u2019 Fieldnotes also recorded many positive interethnic interactions, including an \nenthusiastic repartee between two black British national prisoners, of Nigerian and Jamaican origin in a \ncontract services workshop. Whilst sticking bubblewrap onto empty fruit punnets, \u2018their time was spent \n\u2018racially\u2019 abusing each other and claiming the superiority of African or Caribbean cultures\u2019, the \nhumorous mood surviving even when one called the other a \u2018jungle monkey\u2019.5   \n \n \n \n \n \n2 The ethnic composition (based on HMPS ethnic group codes) of the prison (n= 385), was 56% White British\/European, \n30% Black Caribbean\/African\/British, 7% \u2018Mixed Race\u2019 and 6% Asian. The interview sample slightly over-represented the \nminority ethnic population. The population self-defined as Christian (49%), Muslim (19%), Other (2%), and of nil religion \n(30%). Eighty-two per cent of prisoners were British Nationals, and 18% were Foreign Nationals.   \n3 Interviewee R23 \u2013 White, British National, Christian prisoner \n4 Interviewee R51 - Asian, British National, Muslim prisoner \n5 CP Fieldnote \u2013 3rd January 2007 \n6 \n \n \n                                                \nEven those prisoners from the semi-rural areas of Essex and Kent, who had limited previous exposure \nto minority ethnic and faith groups, expressed positive sentiments about difference. Census estimates \nof the minority ethnic populations of these Home Counties were three and six per cent respectively, \nalthough Kent has experienced an influx of migrant labourers, refugees, and asylum-seekers from \nEurope, and has long-standing and diverse Romany and Traveller populations (Ray and Reed 2005). \nPrisoners\u2019 apparent enthusiasm for diversity was consistent with the high-profile official discourse of \ndiversity and race equality (particularly Prison Service Order 2800) that pervaded the prison alongside a \nmyriad of other prison rules, regulations, and directives. Moreover, it mirrored widely expressed \nopinions about the benefits of ethnic and cultural diversity reported in attitudinal surveys in the general \npopulation (MORI 2005). \n \nSometimes prisoners\u2019 accounts pointed to the educative potential of diversity - learning about \u2018halal\u2019 \nmeat or tribal lineage in African countries \u2013 were examples given by prisoners who valued learning \nabout other ethnic and religious cultural practices. Habitual contact could also produce empathy \ntowards linguistically disadvantaged and politically oppressed foreign national prisoners. Such views \nseemed to co-exist in the prison with a stated abhorrence of racism. In fact, acting in explicitly racist \nways in prison was regarded as indefensible, with the tag \u2018racist\u2019 legitimating retaliatory violence and \ncondemnation from the whole wing and across the prison. It might even allow prisoners to flout the \ninmate code of not \u2018grassing\u2019. A white prisoner noted, for example, \u2018If you tell a guard that someone\u2019s \nracing you or being racist to you that\u2019s not snitching, right. That is standing up for your own religion \nand your own culture or what you are\u2019.6 Similarly, prisoners strongly supported and respected their \nfellow prisoners\u2019 rights to practice their faith in prison.  \n \n \n \n \n \n6 Interviewee R41 \u2013 White, British National, Christian prisoner \n7 \n \n \n                                                \nNonetheless, when prisoners were asked more directly about inter-ethnic friendship groups at \nRochester, many described ethnic separation in the prison based on shared cultural understandings and \ncommonality rather than rigid lines of racial or ethnic division. Prisoners described \u2018feeling better with\u2019, \n\u2018safe\u2019, having \u2018more in common with\u2019 those who came from the same racial or ethnic group as \nthemselves. Observations of inter-ethnic interaction in exercise periods at Rochester were largely \nconsistent with prisoners\u2019 accounts, as this fieldnote records: \n \nThe guys quickly settle into two large groups at either end of the yard, with \nsome pair groups, scattered in between and one of four\/five. Of the two large \ngroups, one is basically white, though there is one tall South Asian guy among \nthem. The other is black... There is some to and fro. One guy goes over to the \nsmaller black group, stays for a while and then comes back. Another guy from \nthe black group goes over to the white group, and comes back after a few \nmoments. The hour passes without any significant shifting around\u20267\n \nHowever, amid the buzz of the more playful atmosphere of young prisoners at the pool or table tennis \ntables in evening \u2018soash\u2019 (association) or during their relaxed saunter across the prison complex during \nfreeflow8, where fist-to-fist greetings or handslaps, youthful chattering, and playfighting occurred, the \ndivisions appeared less static with more fluidity between groups. There was a low-key ethnic \ncomponent in that white, black and Asian individuals tended to cluster together but these groupings did \nnot appear to be actively exclusive or conflictual, and the boundaries were permeable with some mixing \nwithin groups. Elsewhere, for example, when we observed education classes and a poetry\/rap\/video \nworkshop, we noted relaxed and engaging encounters between prisoners of different ethnicities.  \n \n \n \n \n7 RE Fieldnote - 8th September 2006 \n8 Where prisoners are unescorted by officers between the wings and place of work, education, gym, etc. It is a time of \ninformal congregation in the rigid schedule of the prison day, allowing prisoners from different wings to chat, organize \ntrade, or engage in illegitimate activities.  \n8 \n \n \n \nThe cultural fusion and hybridity described in urban youth cultures (Back 1996; Sharma et al. 1996; \nNayak 2003), was also apparent in the closed world of the prison. Influenced by black fashion styles, \nthe most popular and vivid display had prisoners going \u2018backsy\u2019, wearing their emerald green prison \nuniform trousers or jogging bottoms very low, below their hips with their (designer) underwear on \nshow. Other creative attempts to resist the regulated prison issue clothes at Rochester (and implicitly \nthe control of the institution) had led some prisoners working on the servery to turn their jumpers and \njogging bottoms inside out with their prison issue green trousers worn back to front (R25 - Mixed \nRace, British National, Christian prisoner).  \n \nThe discourse of racial accord which was present among prisoners suggests a spirit of unity and \ntolerance reminiscent of the shared solidarity of prisoners described by Sykes (1958) and  Sykes and \nMessinger (1960). It could therefore be viewed as an adaptive response to one of the pains of \nimprisonment, namely, the forced and close interpersonal contact with individuals that the prison \nengenders, which may be mediated through friendly relations and harmony. Alternatively, it may simply \nreflect what social psychologists have theorised as the \u2018contact hypothesis\u2019 where contact with different \nracial and ethnic groups reduces prejudice and increases positive and tolerant attitudes towards them \n(Allport 1954). Even so, as Amin (2002: 969) reminds us, \u2018[h]abitual contact in itself, is no guarantor of \ncultural exchange. It can entrench group animosities and identities, through repetitions of gender, class, \nrace and ethnic practices.\u2019 As the next section shall reveal, there were signs of this occurring at \nRochester. \n \nContesting and Negotiating Difference \n \n9 \n \n \nRe-inscribing boundaries of inclusion\/exclusion \nWhite representation of black cultural forms has never been uniformly accepted (Back 1996; Nayak \n2005), and this was true in the prison too. Some white prisoners were bewildered by, even scathing of, \nwhat they perceived to be white prisoners emulating blackness. Moreover, the practice of \u2018acting black\u2019 \ncannot be divorced from the commercial exploitation of black cultural symbols, which may do nothing \nto dismantle traditional stereotypes of black people (Hill Collins 2006). A bifurcation of imagery can \noperate as Sewell (1997: ix) has demonstrated in his study of schooling, where young black men may be \nsimultaneously regarded as \u2018the darling of popular sub-culture and the sinner in the classroom\u2019, which \ncan shape their active anti-school hypermasculinities to often detrimental effect. \n \nThis tension was further exposed by the way in which older entrenched ethnic ascriptions and \nboundaries of belonging in a Barthian (1969) sense were apparent in social relationships between \nprisoners of different ethnicities. For white prisoners, there always remained the option of returning to \ntraditional narratives of white superiority where culturally othered prisoners were positioned by an \nabsence of shared understandings which prompted their exclusion. Some, for example, derided the \nparticular linguistic forms or \u2018street\u2019 words \u2013 such as \u2018Wha Gwan\u2019, \u2018Hey Blood\u2019, \u2018Fam\u2019 and \u2018Wasteman\u2019 \n\u2013 commonly associated with black prisoners\u2019 talk. As a key marker of identity which could be negatively \nevaluated in the social world of the prison, language was used to inscribe some white prisoners\u2019 own \nidentities in contra to the sound of the Other and it is this relational feature which is integral to self-\nidentification (Hall 1991\/2000). A minority of white prisoners\u2019 talk drew on disturbingly racist logic \nwith the source of indignation and rage similarly being language, in this example reinforced with \nprofoundly gendered abuse: \n  \nlike in the showers, yeah, when there's like fucking group of like Pakis there \nand they fucking speak their own language and I think they\u2019re blatantly fucking \nrude.  \u2026I think that\u2019s being a racist really\u2026It could be like fucking talking \nabout my mum or something, the cunts, right next to me, and I wouldn't even \n10 \n \n \n                                                \nknow [laughs].   \n(White, British National, Nil religion \u2013 R40) \n \nSuch racialised discourses had an ambivalent quality - infused with envy, disdain, and resentment \u2013 and \non occasion, readily employed in reference to Muslim identification among prisoners. A particular \nsource of jealousy was the collective organization of Muslim prisoners who were perceived and whom \nperceived themselves as a self-protective brotherhood at Rochester (cf. Beckford et al. 2005 for a \ndiscussion of inter-ethnic divisions among Muslim prisoners; see also Spalek and El-Hassan 2007). As \nwas noted by one Mixed Race Muslim prisoner,  \u2018You get the Muslims that stick up for each other \nbecause it\u2019s our religion, we need to look after our own\u20199. It appeared to be the rigid solidarity \nengendered which was most acutely resented by some white prisoners, refracted by the perceived \nabsence among white prisoners. The demands of Islamic religious practice, such as praying five times a \nday or following halal food regulations, were also problematised by some prisoners, particularly where \nthey might have a direct impact, such as in cell-sharing. One white Christian (R8) prisoner, for example, \ndescribed a dispute with his Muslim cell-mate who asked for the television to be turned off when he \nprayed five times a day. His perverse retort was for prayer to take place in the toilet with the television \nresolutely remaining on. Like assumptions about the inherent aggression of black people as illustrated \nin the following interview extract, all of these boundary-making devices function to mark out the other \nand implicitly or explicitly impute an inferior quality about their behaviour or morality (Barth 1969): \n \nI\u2019d say a lot of black people \u2026 it\u2019s just the way that they\u2019re brought up and \nthey live they have to have that bit of attitude \u2026 I think it\u2019s just their culture \nreally. \n(White, British National, Christian \u2013 R47) \n \n \n \n \n9 Interviewee R15 \u2013 Mixed Race, British National, Muslim prisoner \n11 \n \n \n                                                \n \nThus, the ethnic solidarities referred to earlier also served as fault lines when flash points and everyday \nconflicts common to prison life surfaced in the form of racialised tensions (see also Edgar et al. 2003)10. \nIndeed, one white British National prisoner observed that it is was the \u2018cussing\u2019 of female family \nmembers (\u2018Your Mum\u2026\u2019) or using racialised and heavily gendered insults - calling someone a \u2018black \ncunt,\u2019 or saying \u2018You white fucker whore, you honkey,\u2019 - which was always guaranteed to lead to fights \nor things \u2018kicking off\u2019 at Rochester11. Such utterances demonstrated how hegemonic forms of \nmasculinity premised on the implicit denigration of women were superimposed in the everyday lives of \nmale prisoners (see also Earle and Phillips 2007).  \n \nEncounters between white prisoners of different nationalities could also be fractious, further \nunderlining the limits of a black-white dichotomy. Incidents were described which revealed deep-seated \nprejudices and resentments which flowed from \u2018road\u2019 into the prison. Expressions of xenophobism \nwere made on occasion by white British national prisoners \u2013 \u2018Out on road basically I would normally \nkick the shit out of them [Kosovans] because they\u2026 they come over and they harass girls, sort of \nthing\u201912. However, there was less evidence of such perceptions shaping prison life for white foreign \nnational prisoners, whose experiences were more greatly determined by the constant threat and anxiety \nof deportation. Relations between black and Asian prisoners also exposed the complexity of intra-\nminority ethnic relations. A white prisoner, described observing an Asian prisoner edgily joking and \nlaughing about calling a black prisoner a \u2018jungle bunny\u2019 and being called a \u2018Paki\u2019 in response13. From a \nblack prisoner, this similarly expressed hostility \u2013 \u2018\u2026like I ain\u2019t got nothing against them but I can\u2019t \n \n \n \n \n10 Some such incidents between prisoners (n=24) during the fieldwork period were formally reported and recorded in the \nprison\u2019s Racist Incident Monitoring Forms which are scrutinised by the Governor. \n11 Interviewee R41 - White, British National, Christian prisoner \n12 Interviewee R28 - White, British National, Christian prisoner \n13 Interviewee R21 \u2013 White, British National, Nil religion \n12 \n \n \n                                                \nmake friends with Asian people.

Indeed many prisoners commented on the absence of racism among prisoners at \nRochester. However, as Frosh et al. (2002) have observed researching young masculinities in London, \nthose who espouse the irrelevance of race may simultaneously project racialised and sometimes racist \nperceptions. In this sense, negative racialisation and racism can be seen as having a \u2018hidden presence\u2019 \nwhich requires of prisoners racial allegiance when friction occurs or violence seems likely to erupt. \n \nWhite privilege \u2018on the back foot\u2019? \nIn Rochester, perhaps because of the relatively large number of minority ethnic prisoners in the \npopulation, it seemed that black prisoners were able to assert their presence and influence in social \nrelations, with some white prisoners \u2018acting black\u2019 (Nayak 2005) an important example of this16. \nOccasional references were made to black prisoners being at the top of the pecking order or controlling \nthe informal economy and some facilities at Rochester \u2013 who and at what time other prisoners could \nenter the showers, play pool during association, receive larger food portions from the servery, or sell \nburn (tobacco) - and here a black prisoner hints at the bullying behaviour of some black prisoners who \nit is suggested deliberately seek out vulnerable white prisoners:  \n \n\u2026 you do get incidents that like two or three black boys and they will target \n \n \n \n \n14 Interviewee R16 - Black, British National, Christian prisoner \n15 Racialisation is used here to signify the ways in which meaning becomes attached to the ideas or actions of culturally \ndifferentiated individuals or groups, which is then evaluated positively, negatively or indeed in ambiguous ways (see Murji \nand Solomos 2005). This conceptualisation recognises racialisation as a temporally and spatially contingent process which \nmay be shaped by political, economic, or social factors at any given moment, and therefore may be unpredictable or \ncontradictory. \n16 This contrasted with black prisoners\u2019 accounts where they had been in prisons with a small minority ethnic population, \nwhere they had felt threatened and ostracised. \n13 \n \n \none white guy\u2026 actually they walked to his cell, they took his stuff and his \nCDs and stuff and they walked off\u2026 when I see a black person do that to \nanother person if he\u2019s white or Asian or Chinese and it really, it gets me really \nangry because that\u2019s why, that\u2019s why other cultures how they look at black \npeople, you know, they seem to think all the same.   \n(Black, Foreign National, Christian \u2013 R37) \n \nThe examples given in interviews were of dominant black prisoners targeting more vulnerable white or \nChinese prisoners, but the degree to which such behaviour was racialised is hard to ascertain. Most \nprisoners\u2019 accounts of hierarchies within Rochester did not explicitly claim that prisoners of one \nparticular racial, ethnic, religious or national group were at the pinnacle of the power structure. \nHowever, what did emerge was a sense of the often unpredictable and intimidating way in which racism \ncould be invoked in the volatile environment of a young offenders\u2019 institution, as these interview \nextracts reveal: \n \n\u2026the kid said I looked like Elvis, we were having a laugh and a joke through \nthe pipes and that, \u2018You look like fucking Elvis\u2019.

I said, \u2018You look like Side Show \nBob, mate,\u2019 you know, coming back to him, then 'Fuck you, I don\u2019t joke with \nwhite boys', you know what I mean. I said why are you bringing the racial issue \nlike\u2026And I said \u2018Fuck it, mate, you\u2019re like Aladdin, mate, you know, not racial, \nand he said, \u2018Why you being racist?\u2019 \u2026 He said, \u2018You\u2019re racist, you\u2019re racist \nlike, fucking you Cafar\u2019, and all this like.\u2019   \n(White, British National, Christian \u2013 R30) \n \n\u2026it\u2019s just the way they talk, like, \u2018That little White ting, and that little White \n14 \n \n \n                                                \nprick,\u2019 you know and \u2018White this and White that\u2019\u2026But if we\u2019re sitting there \ngoing, \u2018Yeah that little Paki cunt,\u2019 or 'Big black prick', then all of a sudden, \nwe\u2019re, we\u2019re labelled as a racist. \n(White, British National, Nil religion \u2013 R53) \n \nThe anxiety and resentment expressed in these accounts is testimony to the difficult terrain that race \nand ethnicity occupies in late modernity. Far from inhabiting an uncontested position of power and \nprivilege within the social hierarchy of the prison17, such comments reveal an uncertainty among white \nprisoners about how to navigate everyday contacts with black prisoners. There is the dual risk of being \nmisunderstood and labelled as racist or alternatively having their whiteness negatively racialised and \ndenigrated, and thus many may be angrily struggling with the notion of being victims of racialised \nexclusion themselves. A safe option requires that white prisoners at Rochester mimic the language, \nmannerisms, and dress of black prisoners, - a finding similarly reported by Bartollas et al. (1976) in their \nstudy of juvenile prison culture in Ohio. As one prisoner admitted, \u2018I do speak of\u2026 \u2018Wha g'wan, \u2018What \nam I like?\u2019 \u2026 I know there\u2019s other people doing it to fit in, cos they don\u2019t want to be outside the group \nor being picked on\u201918. \n \nSuch fears are heightened by the demonstratively violent and immediate way in which racism is policed \nby black prisoners at Rochester. In one interview, a white prisoner described how \u2018JJ\u2019, having used the \n\u2018nigger\u2019 epithet after evening lock-up, had been stamped on and had his head flushed down the toilet by \na group of black prisoners the following morning19. Other prisoners recalled similar occurrences, whilst \na prisoner who was a member of the National Front had on several occasions to be segregated for his \nown safety.  \n \n \n \n \n17 See also Haylett\u2019s (2001) work on the positioning of the white working class, which he has argued challenges dominant \nsocial systems of privilege as they pertain to class and race, as economic privilege and success are not \u2018naturally\u2019 assured. \n18 Interviewee R52 - White, British National, Christian prisoner \n19 Interviewee R39 - White, British National, Christian prisoner \n15 \n \n \n                                                \n \nThe primacy of local identification: \u2018it\u2019s the area zone thing\u201920  \n \nWhilst prisoners spoke at length about the tricky negotiation of racial, ethnic, and religious difference in \nthe routine life of the prison, area-based identification among white and minority ethnic British national \nprisoners was also a significant dimension of young prisoners\u2019 identities. Prisoners\u2019 narratives revealed a \nstrong investment in neighbourhood- or estate-based identities with powerful sentiments of \nterritorialism or \u2018postcode pride\u2019 21 expressed. A black, foreign national prisoner (R2) described the \n\u2018tribal\u2019 practice of prisoners calling out their postcodes after evening lock-up, whilst, another noted \u2018it \ndon\u2019t matter what you\u2019re in for it\u2019s just who you know and what area you\u2019re from\u201922. \n \nPrisoners described local identification as a mode through which new friendships were forged at \nRochester. It enabled them to make meaningful connections with their local communities as \nconversations could cover mutual friends, relatives, and leisure, education, or employment venues. \nSignificantly, local identities operated as a way of anchoring prisoners\u2019 belonging to somewhere external \nto the prison, and this was true even if those places were a site of family discord, personal \ndisappointment, or violence, thus representing a familiar, but also vulnerable location. \n \nLocal affiliations created additional obligations among prisoners to assist in prison disputes involving \nfellow prisoners or even prison officers, as Crewe (2005) found in his ethnography of Wellingborough \nprison. As one white Rochester prisoner opined, \u2018\u2026if you\u2019re from someone\u2019s ends [neighbourhood] \nthen, yeah, they are, they got a certain amount of liability to look out for you innit\u2026you have to look \n \n \n \n \n20 Quoted from Prisoner R50 \u2013 Black, British National, Muslim prisoner \n21 This term was first used by Rod Earle in a co-presented conference paper (Earle and Phillips 2007). \n22 Interviewee R18 - Asian, British National, Muslim prisoner \n16 \n \n \n                                                \nout for each other\u201923. This would typically mean \u2018backing them\u2019 in a \u2018beef\u2019 or disagreement with another \nprisoner. Within the prison, these local identities might need to be reconfigured to some degree. \nWhereas reference was made to very localised area \u2018beefs\u2019 while \u2018on road\u2019 \u2013 for example, between \nBrixton and Peckham or Hackney and Tottenham, in prison broader identifications would lead \nprisoners from South London to be aligned against prisoners from East, West or North London, or the \nHome Counties of Kent and Essex. \n \nThere was a near universal acceptance of area-based solidarities within prison, which often usurped or \noverlaid identities organized through race or ethnicity. This from a prisoner: \n  \nI\u2019m from West.  I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re black.  I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re brown.  I \ndon\u2019t care if you\u2019re white.  I will cotch [hang out] with people from the West \nbecause they\u2019re my boys, they\u2019re my Westmans, I\u2019m a West boy.   \n(White, British National, Christian \u2013 R41) \n \nOf course, given the residential clustering of ethnic groups within the UK (Simpson 2007), a local or \nneighbourhood identification could also be largely synonymous with an ethnic identification, but this \nwas primarily articulated by the young men through locality rather than ethnicity. This must be viewed \nalongside a convergence among many white and minority ethnic prisoners regarding the emptiness or \nlatent qualities of ethnicity for their own self-identities. For a multitude of prisoners at Rochester, \nethnicity had a dormant or undeveloped sense - it was perceived as immutable but not at the forefront \nof lived experience inside or outside prison (see also Back 1996; Frosh et al. 2002). This is a further \nreminder of the need both conceptually and theoretically to move beyond binary understandings of  \nrace and ethnicity in late modernity. \n \n \n \n \n23 Interviewee R13 \u2013 White, British National prisoner of nil religion \n17 \n \n \n                                                \n \nLocal identification acted as a powerful channel for dividing prisoners and was directly linked to social \nrelations at Rochester. Prisoners\u2019 spatialised identities, on occasion, meant the permeation of \u2018area \nbeef\u2019s into the prison where local conflicts and antagonisms that had set up rival groupings on road \nwere imported into and sustained in the prison. A prison officer described the difficulties involved in \nmanaging these locality-based tensions among \u2018the London Posses, or the Faversham Boys, Essex \nLads, Kent Boys, North Kent Boys\u201924. During the fieldwork, on one of the larger residential wings, \nserious clashes between black prisoners from South London and from East London had occurred, \nfollowing a prior dispute at Feltham prison, which led to the Governor shipping out five ringleaders. \nMore commonly, however, it seemed that area beefs from road were suspended or mediated through \nindividual interaction in prison as this extract reveals: \n \nBut like before I came to jail and that yeah, Brixton and Peckham yeah, they\u2019re \nalways in this mad beefing thing, yeah. Since I came to jail I met a lot of \nPeckham boys\u2026I get on with them and them sort of things innit.  They don\u2019t \nmake what\u2019s on the outside bother them on the inside\u2026 \n(Black, British National, Christian \u2013 R12) \n \nWhilst area affiliations seemingly serve the same function of providing a secure base for prisoners, as \nSykes envisioned when he described the all-encompassing prisoner self- and collective identity, for \nforeign national prisoners, their local might be geographically distant. This was particularly true for \nprisoners who had been arrested in transit at airports, whose primary spatial attachments remained their \ncountries of residence. Dislocation was uppermost in their accounts of incarceration, often \nexperiencing bewilderment at the British criminal justice system, and situating themselves as separate \n \n \n \n \n24 RE fieldnote \u2013 17 July 2006 \n18 \n \n \nand different from the majority of other prisoners. For foreign national prisoners whose lives before \nprison had allowed them to establish a place of work and residence in England, there was a sense of \nnew belongings, and immediate connections to where they had been living in the UK. Their narratives, \nhowever, described a personal life history lived in their countries of origin which appeared to becoming \nincreasingly tenuous with their longevity in England, and their desire to stay in the UK. These stories \nare the outcome of globalised stratification where people from countries of the South are located at the \nbottom of the global hierarchy which is structured around new modes of economic production and \nlabour informalisation (Bhattacharyya et al. 2002). Such processes lie behind economic migration, crime \nacross borders, and immigration offences which have brought foreign national prisoners into \nRochester. At the same time broader exclusionary discourses transpose a prison sentence to one of \nindeterminate uncertainty and double punishment through deportation following recent moral panics \nover crime committed by \u2018foreigners\u2019. \n \nImplications for Theoretical Criminology \n \nThis ethnographic study of Rochester young offenders\u2019 institution points to the fragmentary nature of \nprisoner society in the 21st century British context. Whilst limited to a single case study, prisoners\u2019 \naccounts at Rochester suggest the declining influence of a unified prisoner group, a finding similarly \nreported by Crewe (2005) at Wellingborough prison. As he and Carroll (1974) have speculated, this may \nresult from the less brutalising conditions of incarceration compared with the era of Sykes\u2019 classic \nstudy, and in the UK, the individualist influence of the Incentives and Earned Privileges scheme, which \nhas diluted the role of unified prisoner collectivities. The importation of external identities is more \nsignificant in prisoners\u2019 lived experience at Rochester, although individual support and collective \nsecurity appears more often to be sourced through local affiliations than ethnicity.  \n \n19 \n \n \nThe complex identities of young prisoners and their impact on prison social relations also requires \nengagement with theoretical work developed outside criminology. Recent social theory has been \ndominated by the key theme of globalisation in late modernity (Lash and Urry 1994 ), and yet much of \nthis work has failed to make explicit the empirical links in relation to race and ethnicity (Knowles 2003). \nMoreover, while other scholars have emphasised mobility and extensive communication networking as \nmodes of reconfiguring and hybridising youth cultures in disparate nations (Pilkington and Johnson \n2003), young prisoners\u2019 identities need to be represented and understood through the lens of the local. \nTheir claims to localised identities vigorously demonstrated through postcode territorialism must also \nbe part of the picture. This undoubtedly reflects a typical youthful preoccupation with the immediate \nenvironment and real limits to mobility which may be common to all groups of young people, whatever \ntheir ethnicity or class position. Bauman (2004) may also be right, however, when he claims that, in \ntimes of insecurity and uncertainty, territorialism provides a mode of being through which individuals \ncan find safety and security in their everyday lives. By erecting boundaries of belonging which exclude \nothers from strictly delineated and symbolic \u2018area zones\u2019, these young men claim dominion, \n(perceptions of) power, and perhaps most importantly, status. The opportunity to exclude may be one \nof the few means by which these young men, marked by their low social, political, and economic \nposition in late modern society, can exercise agency, and avoid the bashing of stigma which Bauman \n(2004) sees as the lot of the \u2018underclass\u2019, undoubtedly further hardened in the case of the criminalised.  \n \nThese identities, in indicating an emphatic allegiance and emotional attachment to place in British \nsociety, are particularly significant for those of minority ethnic origin. Territorialism, more generally, \nmay reflect what Robins and Cohen (1978) long ago saw as integral to working class cultures, and what \nClarke (1979) has argued can act as a defence against changes wrought by globalising forces. According \nto Robins and Cohen, deeply embedded in working class cultures is participation in the symbolic \nprocess of \u2018owning\u2019 a material locality, which for young people is managed through \u2018gangs\u2019 or \u2018fighting \ncrews\u2019 which are pitted against rivals who engage in ritualistic displays of aggression. Although class \nidentification was not articulated by Rochester prisoners, their area-based allegiance was implicitly \n20 \n \n \ninflected with a class-based solidarity, which often trumped ethnic identification, a finding Back (1996) \ntoo reported in his South London study of urban youth cultures, where \u2018neighbourhood nationalism\u2019 \nprevailed amidst notions of inclusion and racial harmony, at least between white and black people. As \nsuch, it reminds us of the critical need for the motif of class to remain central to analyses of identities, \nat a time when much academic writing has eschewed the significance of class, particularly in relation to \nthe white working class (Haylett 2001). Moreover, criminology must avoid contributing to what \nJohnson (2008: 78) has described as \u2018the wider paradox of class in social life: class differences are \neverywhere yet appear largely unnamed\u2019 (see also Webster, this volume). \n \nThis is not to argue that race and ethnicity no longer matter. Indeed, the fault lines may be as sharply \ndrawn as in the past, but they may be less often invoked, perhaps refracted by a widespread acceptance \nof diversity as young prisoners have been socialised into notions of a multicultural society. Prisoners\u2019 \ndeclarations of the absence of racism and the illegitimacy of its status in prisoner society at Rochester \nbelie the multiple manifestations of racialisation and racism which seep into daily inter-ethnic \nencounters. However, the black-white polarities of old have been splintered beyond recognition by the \nmore complex identity dynamics of Britain in the early 21st century, which include vacillating \nracialisation and articulations of racisms which intersect with ethnicity, faith, class, and nationality. A \ndegree of black (and Muslim) cultural (and physical) pre-eminence in the social world of the prison, can \nbe likened to the black hegemony of prison subcultures in the US, referred to thirty years ago by Jacobs \n(1979). Whilst Jacobs attributed this to the majority presence of black prisoners in many US \ncorrectional institutions, and their shared history of collective organisation through race, the study at \nRochester appears to signify the instability of social hierarchies where white privilege is no longer \nassured but black prisoners\u2019 assertive presence is more certain, albeit contested. As Nayak (2005: 145) \nsuggests, drawing on insights from post-structuralism, particularly the work of Brah (1996), \u2018blackness \nis split, marked by an ambivalence that does not necessarily equate with \u2018powerlessness\u2019\u2026the process \n21 \n \n \n                                                \nof racialization may render visible minorities more powerful in certain arenas and less powerful in \nothers\u201925 (see alsoRattansi 2005). \n  \nFurthermore, it seems that the young prisoners interviewed in this study are \u2018doing multiculturalism\u2019 \u2013 \nin ways that are akin to what Gilroy (2005: 439) describes as the \u2018unruly, untidy and convivial mode of \ninteraction in which differences have to be actively negotiated\u2019. Notwithstanding this, the insecurity and \nanxiety that are being generated by varying forms of racialisation among many white prisoners suggests \nthat they have yet to come to terms with these changed times. This is an increasingly apparent element \nof late modern white ethnicities (see Nayak 2003, see also Webster this volume), where the normative \ncontent of whiteness only becomes visible through othering by minority ethnic groups (Garner 2006).  \n \nThe nuanced understanding of social relations set out in this article seeks to incorporate and \nforeground agentic understandings of diverse white and minority ethnic experience. I have shown how \nracialised and ethnicised identities intersect with faith, nationality, class and gender, and incorporate a \nsignificant degree of local identification. I also point to the importance of an awareness of the flux of \nwhite privilege and the contingent nature of white ethnicities. I think that these theoretical strands \ndrawn from research in a prison environment can supplement research across the subfield of \nethnicities, racism and criminology. Following these lines of inquiry has the potential to invigorate \ntheoretical and qualitative research in an area that hitherto has been dominated by quantitative analyses \nof crime and the criminal justice process (see Phillips and Bowling 2007 for a review of this work and \ndiscussion of some excellent qualitative exceptions). Work in this vein must not lose sight of the \nstriking over-representation of black people in the prisons of England and Wales, a \u2018fact\u2019 that \ncriminologists should engage with politically as well as in theoretical and empirical research. As \nWacquant (2002: 386) has observed, the prison is a \u2018template or vector of broader social forces, political \n \n \n \n \n25 The possibility that this power differential is skewed against minority ethnic groups in the arena of officer-prisoner \nrelationships will be the subject of future analysis. \n22 \n \n \nnexi, and cultural processes that traverse its walls\u2019, and as such it may be possible to provide a positive \nanswer to the personal and academic question that I asked in the introduction to this paper. It seems \nclear that race and racism are not what they were (Gilroy 2005: 438), but historical continuities remain \n(Miles and Brown 2003). \n \n \n23 \n \n \nReferences \n \nAllport, Gordon. W.
