(1962), is believed to be dominated by obscured and\nunobscured active galactic nuclei (AGN) and quasi-stellar objects\n(QSOs). Indeed, deep ROSAT surveys to the limit \u224810\u221215 erg s\u22121\n\u0002E-mail: age@astro.noa.gr\ncm\u22122 have resolved 60\u201380 per cent of the soft band (0.5\u20132 keV) XRB\ninto discrete sources (e.g. Boyle et al. 1994; Hasinger et al. 1998;\nLehmann et al. 2001). Follow-up spectroscopic studies have demon-\nstrated that most of them are AGN with a small fraction associated\nwith groups or clusters (Georgantopoulos et al. 1996; Schmidt et al.\n1998; Lehmann et al. 2001). Recently, sensitive Chandra surveys ex-\ntended the studies above to fainter flux limits, \u224810\u221217\u201310\u221216 erg s\u22121\ncm\u22122, resolving 80\u201395 per cent of the soft band XRB (Mushotzky\net al. 2000; Giacconi et al. 2002; Rosati et al. 2002).

Georgakakis et al.\ndevelopment from these ultradeep surveys is the emergence of X-\nray faint sources with properties similar to those of \u2018normal\u2019 galax-\nies (i.e. systems not obviously dominated by AGN activity). These\nsources, although too faint to dominate the XRB (<40 per cent;\nGiacconi & Zamorani 1987; Griffiths & Padovani 1990; Pearson\net al. 1997; Alexander et al. 2002; Hornschemeier et al. 2002a;\nPersic & Rephaeli 2003; Ranalli, Comastri & Setti 2003) are likely\nto outnumber AGN at faint flux limits (<10\u221217 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122,\nHornschemeier et al. 2002b; Ranalli et al. 2003). A study of this\npopulation to high redshifts provides a census of the global star\nformation rate (SFR) complementary to that obtained from other\nwavelengths. More importantly, the X-rays are unique in that they\nare the only tool available to probe the evolution of low- and high-\nmass X-ray binaries as well as hot gas. Comparison of the X-ray\nproperties of local \u2018normal\u2019 galaxy samples with high-redshift ones\nprovides a picture of the evolution of the Universe that is comple-\nmentary to that inferred from the study of QSOs that dominate the\nXRB.\nA study of \u2018normal\u2019 galaxies in the local Universe (<100 Mpc)\nhas been initiated by both the Einstein and the ROSAT satel-\nlites. Ellipticals were found to retain large amounts (\u2248108\u20131011\nM\b) of hot gas (T \u2248 107 K) that dominate their X-ray emission\n(Fabbiano 1989; Kim, Fabbiano & Trinchieri 1992; Fabbiano &\nShapley 2002), while the spiral galaxy X-rays were shown to orig-\ninate from a combination of stellar point sources and diffuse hot\n(T \u2248 1\u20138 \u00d7 106 K) gas (Read, Ponman & Strickland 1997; Read &\nPonman 2001). Moreover, a number of studies have demonstrated\nthe significance of the environment, the star formation history and\nthe total galaxy mass in understanding the \u2018normal\u2019 galaxy X-ray\nemission (Helsdon et al. 2001; O\u2019Sullivan, Forbes & Ponman 2001;\nRead & Ponman 2001; Fabbiano & Shapley 2002).\nOver the last few years the launch of XMM\u2013Newton and Chandra,\nwith their significantly improved sensitivity and resolution, enabled\nstudy of the X-ray properties of \u2018normal\u2019 galaxies at cosmological\ndistances. Brandt et al. (2001b) studied the mean X-ray properties of\nbright spirals at z \u2248 0.5 using a 500-ks Chandra exposure of Hubble\nDeep Field (HDF) North. They found an increase in the mean X-ray\nluminosity of their sample compared with local spirals, suggesting\nevolution. Hornschemeier et al. (2002a) used stacking analysis to\ninvestigate the mean properties of z \u2248 1 spirals in the Chandra Deep\nField North. They estimated a mean 0.5\u20132 keV flux of \u22485 \u00d7 10\u221218\nerg cm\u22122 s\u22121 for the spirals in their sample and found evidence for\nan increase in their LX\/LB ratio. However, statistical uncertainties\ndid not allow firm conclusions to be drawn. Stacking of Lyman-\nbreak galaxies in the same field extended our knowledge of the\nX-ray properties of non-AGN-dominated galaxies to z \u2248 3 (Brandt\net al. 2001a; Nandra et al. 2002). Lyman-break systems, believed to\nbe a combination of starbursts and low-luminosity AGN, are found\nto have mean X-ray luminosities and LX\/LB ratios comparable to\nthose of the most luminous starbursts in the local universe (Brandt\net al. 2001a).\nAlthough the studies above provide valuable information on the\nnature and the evolution of the X-ray emission in \u2018normal\u2019 galaxies,\nthey focus on either local (\u224820 Mpc) or higher-redshift (z > 0.4)\nsamples. Study of the X-ray properties of \u2018normal\u2019 galaxies in the\nintermediate-redshift regime is still missing, although critical in in-\nterpreting their evolutionary properties by providing a link between\nlocal and distant samples. In this paper we address this issue using a\nshallow (2\u201310 ks) XMM\u2013Newton X-ray survey covering an area of\n\u22481.5 deg2. These observations overlap with the 2dF Galaxy Redshift\nSurvey (2dFGRS; a mean redshift of z \u2248 0.1, Colless et al. 2001),\nproviding a unique opportunity to study the mean X-ray properties\nof \u2018normal\u2019 galaxies at z \u2248 0.1. Compared with previous studies,\nthe 2dFGRS has the advantage of high-quality spectra, accurate red-\nshift measurements and reliable classifications into different galaxy\ntypes (E\/S0, spirals) based on the observed spectroscopic properties.\nMoreover, sources with optical spectra revealing powerful AGN can\neasily be discarded from the \u2018normal\u2019 galaxy sample. Our analysis\nof the mean X-ray properties of a well-defined sample of \u2018normal\u2019\ngalaxies provides a reference point at z \u2248 0.1 for comparison with\nsimilar studies at higher redshifts.\nSection 2 presents the XMM\/2dF survey, Section 3 describes the\nreduction of the X-ray data, while Section 4 details the selection cri-\nteria of the sample used in the present study. The stacking technique\nis outlined in Section 5, the results are presented in Section 6 and\nare discussed in Section 7. Finally, Section 8 summarizes our con-\nclusions. Throughout this paper we adopt H 0 = 65 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121\nand q0 = 0.5.\n2 T H E X M M \/ 2 D F S U RV E Y\nThe North Galactic Pole F864 region [RA(J2000) = 13h 41m;\nDec.(J2000) = 00\u25e6 00\u2032] and the South Galactic Pole [SGP;\nRA(J2000) = 00h 57m, Dec.(J2000) = \u221228\u25e6 00\u2032] were surveyed\nby XMM\u2013Newton between 2002 May and July as part of the Guar-\nanteed Time programme. The observations consist of nine pointings\nin the SGP and seven pointings in the F864 region each with an ex-\nposure time of \u22482\u201310 ks. The RA and Dec. of the centre of each\npointing are listed in Table 1.

The 2dFGRS is a large-scale spectroscopic\nsurvey that fully exploits the capabilities of the 2dF multifibre spec-\ntrograph on the 4-m Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT). This is an\non-going project that aims to obtain high-quality spectra and red-\nshifts for 250 000 galaxies brighter than an extinction-corrected\nlimit of bj < 19.4 mag over an area of \u22482000 deg2. Recently, data\nfor about 100 000 galaxies have been released (100k data release).\nPart of this unprecedented spectroscopic data base overlaps with our\nXMM\u2013Newton survey and hence optical spectroscopic information\nis available for galaxies in the F864 and SGP regions to the above\nmagnitude limit. Moreover, the central regions of both the F864\nand SGP XMM\u2013Newton survey have been observed by the ROSAT\nsatellite (Georgantopoulos et al. 1996; Griffiths et al. 1996).\n3 X M M \u2013 N E W TO N O B S E RVAT I O N S\nThe XMM\u2013Newton data have been analysed using the Science\nAnalysis Software (SAS 5.3).

Exposure maps accounting\nfor vignetting, charge-coupled device (CCD) gaps and bad pixels\nhave been constructed for each spectral band.\nSource detection is performed on the 0.5\u20138 keV image using\nthe WAVDETECT task of CIAO with a false probability threshold of\n10\u22125 (Freeman et al. 2002) corresponding to about 5\u03c3 . A total of\n508 X-ray sources have been detected to the limit f X(0.5\u20138 keV) \u2248\n10\u221214 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122. The 0.5\u20138 keV detection flux limit of individual\nXMM\u2013Newton pointings for a point source on-axis are shown in\nTable 1. We note that the false probability threshold of 10\u22125 for the\ntotal band (0.5\u20138 keV) corresponds to a detection threshold of about\n4\u03c3 in the soft band (0.5\u20132 keV). This limit translates to a typical\non-axis source flux of f X (0.5\u20132 keV) \u2248 4 \u00d7 10\u221215 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 in\nthe soft 0.5\u20132 keV band.\nA byproduct of the source extraction algorithm is the construction\nof background maps for each spectral band. The mean background\ncounts per pixel (estimated from the background maps) are also\nlisted in Table 1. A detailed analysis of the nature of the X-ray\nsources detected in the F864 and SGP areas will be presented in\na forthcoming paper (Georgantopoulos et al., in preparation). To\nconvert counts to flux the energy conversion factors (ECF) of in-\ndividual detectors are calculated assuming a power-law spectrum\nwith \b = 1.7 and Galactic absorption, N H = 2 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122, ap-\npropriate for both the SGP and F864 fields. The mean ECF for the\nmosaic of all three detectors is estimated by weighting the ECFs of\nindividual detectors by the respective exposure time. For the encir-\ncled energy correction, accounting for the energy fraction outside\nthe aperture within which source counts are accumulated, we adopt\nthe calibration performed by Ghizzardi (2001a,b). These studies\nuse both PN and MOS observations of point sources to formulate\nthe XMM\u2013Newton point spread function (PSF) for different ener-\ngies and off-axis angles. In particular, a King profile is fitted to the\ndata with parameters that are a function of both energy and off-axis\nangle.\n4 G A L A X Y S A M P L E\nThe \u2018normal\u2019 galaxy sample used in the present study is compiled\nfrom the 100k data release of the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey. A full\ndescription of the survey design, spectroscopic observations, data\nreduction and redshift measurements of the 2dFGRS data set can\nbe found in Colless et al. (2001). In brief, redshift estimation is per-\nformed using two independent methods: the first cross-correlates the\nspectra with a library of absorption-line galaxy and stellar templates\nafter clipping emission lines, while the second finds and then fits\nemission lines. The automated redshift estimates are also confirmed\nby visual inspection. Occasionally, a manual redshift is determined\nby fitting spectral features missed by the automated method (Colless\net al. 2001). A quality flag, Q, measuring the reliability of the esti-\nmated redshifts has been assigned. Reliable redshifts have Q \u0001 3,\nwhile Q = 2 corresponds to a probable redshift and Q = 1 indicates\nno redshift measurement.\nSpectral classification of the 2dFGRS galaxies has been per-\nformed by applying principal-component analysis (PCA) techniques\non the observed spectra (Folkes et al. 1999; Madgwick et al. 2002).\nSpectral types are determined on the basis of the \u03b7 parameter:\n\u03b7 = 0.5pc1 \u2212 pc2, (1)\nwhere pc1 and pc2 are the projections of the first two eigenspectra\nderived from PCA. Comparison of the \u03b7 parameter of the 2dFGRS\ngalaxies with that derived for the observed spectra of the Kennicutt\ngalaxy atlas (Kennicutt 1992) shows that there is a continuous re-\nlation between \u03b7 and morphological types (Madgwick et al. 2002,\ntheir fig. 4). We adopt the classification scheme of Madgwick et al.\n(2002) and group galaxies into four spectral types: E\/S0, Sa, Sb and\nScd. The adopted range of the \u03b7 parameter for the above spectral\ntypes are presented in Table 2. \u2018Unclassified\u2019 galaxies with no spec-\ntral classification are systems with low signal-to-noise ratio spectra\nthat did not allow spectral-type determination.\nThe present sample comprises a total of 235 2dFGRS galaxies\nwith Q > 2 that lie within 13 arcmin off the centre of the EPIC-PN\ncamera to avoid the low signal-to-noise ratio areas at the edge of\nthe XMM\u2013Newton field of view.

Moreover, two\n2dFGRS sources (TGN 335Z095 and TGN 336Z241) lie close to an\nextended X-ray source, probably a cluster. These galaxies are not\nindividually detected at X-ray wavelengths and are excluded from\nthe stacking analysis described in Section 5 to avoid contamination\nof the stacked signal by emission not directly associated with the\ngalaxies. A further four sources with stellar optical spectra are also\nexcluded from the analysis reducing the final sample of 2dFGRS\ngalaxies to 226. The distribution of the present sample of 2dFGRS\ngalaxies to spectral types as well as the corresponding mean red-\nshifts are shown in Table 2. We also note that the present sample is\n\u224870 per cent complete. The incompleteness is due to Q < 2 galaxies\nas well as instrumental limitations (e.g. fibre collisions). The optical\nB-band absolute magnitude distributions of elliptical and spirals in\nthe sample are shown in Fig. 1.\n5 S TAC K I N G P RO C E D U R E\nStacking methods have been extensively used in X-ray astronomy to\nstudy the mean properties (e.g. flux, luminosity and hardness ratios)\nof well-defined samples of sources that are otherwise too faint in the\nX-ray range to be individually detected (e.g. Nandra et al. 2002).\nIn practice the X-ray counts (source plus background) at the posi-\ntion of each galaxy in the sample are added excluding X-ray-detected\ngalaxies. The expected background contribution is estimated by\nsumming the counts from regions around each source. Assuming\nPoisson statistics for the counts a significance level is estimated for\nthe summed signal.\nTo determine the size of the region within which the source-plus-\nbackground counts are extracted we adopt the empirical method\ndescribed by Nandra et al. (2002). Tests are performed in which\nthe radius of the circular aperture within which the source-plus-\nbackground counts are summed varies (from one trial to the next)\nbetween 8 and 18 arcsec. We find that a radius of 12 arcsec maxi-\nmizes the significance of the stacked signal and hence this optimal\nextraction radius is adopted for the analysis that follows. This ex-\ntraction radius is about three times the on-axis HWHM of the XMM\u2013\nNewton PSF (Hasinger et al. 2001). We also note that the visible disc\nof a Milky Way-type galaxy at z = 0.1 subtends an angular radius\nof \u22488 arcsec.\nTo assess the significance of the stacked signal we estimate the\nbackground by averaging the counts in 60 12-arcsec apertures ran-\ndomly positioned within annular regions centred on the positions of\nthe sample galaxies with inner and outer radii of 20 and 100 arcsec,\nrespectively. To avoid contamination from X-ray detections in the\nbackground estimation, regions close to X-ray sources (8\u201340 arc-\nsec) are excluded. The smooth background map produced by the\nWAVDETECT task of CIAO was also used to estimate the background.\nAlthough no significant differences are found, the background esti-\nmated in the latter case is systematically lower and hence the detec-\ntion significance of the stacked signal is somewhat higher. We adopt\na conservative approach and estimate the background from the sci-\nence image rather than the smooth background map. However, it\nshould be noted that use of the background map does not alter any\nof the conclusions.\nIn practice, 2dFGRS galaxies associated (<8 arcsec) with X-\nray sources detected in the total (0.5\u20138 keV) band above the false\nprobability threshold of 10\u22125 are excluded from the stacking anal-\nysis. As already discussed in the previous section this detection\nlimit corresponds to a soft band (0.5\u20132 keV) detection threshold\nof about 4\u03c3 , which translates to a typical on-axis point source flux\nof f (0.5\u20132 keV) \u22484 \u00d7 10\u221215 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122. Such a low detection\nthreshold is essential to studying the mean properties of X-ray weak\nsources, the signal of which would otherwise be diluted by brighter\nones.\nX-ray-detected 2dFGRS galaxies may differ in their nature from\nX-ray faint galaxies. It is clear that summing counts of different\nclasses of objects is meaningless. We find a total of seven 2dFGRS\ngalaxies associated (<8 arcsec) with X-ray detections above the total\nband (0.5\u20138 keV) false probability threshold of 10\u22125. Two of them\nexhibit clear evidence for AGN activity such as broad emission-line\noptical spectra, high X-ray-to-optical luminosity ratios (LX\/LB >\n\u22121) and X-ray luminosities LX \u2248 1042 erg s\u22121. Another three 2dF-\nGRS galaxies have narrow emission-line optical spectra, LX\/LB \u2248\n\u22121, relatively hard X-ray spectral properties and soft band (0.5\u20132\nkeV) X-ray luminosities in the range 0.3\u20135 \u00d7 1042 erg s\u22121. The\nabove evidence suggests obscured or weak AGN activity. Finally,\ntwo 2dFGRS galaxies have optical spectra exhibiting both absorp-\ntion and narrow emission lines, LX\/LB \u2248 \u22122, soft X-ray spectra\nand LX \u2248 2 \u00d7 1041 erg s\u22121, suggesting either \u2018normal\u2019 galaxies or\nlow-luminosity AGN (LLAGN). A detailed analysis of these galax-\nies will be presented in a forthcoming paper (Georgakakis et al.\n2003).\nFinally, counts associated with the wings of the PSF of bright\nX-ray sources might erroneously increase the stacking signal sig-\nnificance. Therefore, to avoid contamination of the stacking signal\nfrom nearby X-ray sources we have excluded from the analysis 2dF-\nGRS galaxies that lie close (<40 arcsec) to X-ray detections (a total\nof 21). Therefore, a total of 28 2dFRGS sources either lie close to\n(21, 8\u201340 arcsec) or are associated with (total of 7, <8 arcsec) X-ray\ndetections. This reduces the number of galaxies used in the stacking\nanalysis to 198.\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS, MNRAS 344, 161\u2013168\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nThe XMM\u2013Newton\/2dF survey \u2013 I 165\nTable 3.

The X-ray flux in this table is estimated from the raw net\ncounts after correcting individual galaxies for: (i) the effect of vi-\ngnetting estimated from the corresponding exposure map and (ii)\nthe energy fraction outside the adopted aperture of 12 arcsec us-\ning the encircled energy corrections recently derived by Ghizzardi\n(2001a,b) for both the PN and the MOS detectors (see Section 3).\nThe counts-to-flux conversion factor has been derived assuming a\npower law with spectral index \b = 1.7 and Galactic absorption (see\nSection 3). The X-ray luminosities in Table 3 are estimated using the\nX-ray flux derived from the stacking analysis and the mean redshift\nof each subsample also listed in this table.\nThe soft band yields a statistically significant signal for both the\nwhole sample and for the E\/S0 and spiral galaxy subsamples. In\ncontrast, stacking of the hard band counts did not result in a signifi-\ncant signal for either of the samples. For the 2\u20138 keV band 3\u03c3 upper\nlimits are estimated assuming Poisson statistics for the background\nstacked counts. Unfortunately, the estimated upper limits are not\ntight enough to strongly constrain the X-ray spectral properties of\nthe spiral and elliptical galaxy subsamples.\nTo further assess the confidence level of the stacked signal in\nboth the soft and the hard bands we perform extensive simulations:\nmock catalogues are constructed by randomizing the positions of the\n2dFGRS samples in Table 3, avoiding areas close to X-ray sources\n(<40 arcsec). Each of the mock catalogues has the same number\nof sources as the 2dFGRS samples in Table 3. We then apply the\nstacking analysis technique outlined in Section 5 to the mock cata-\nlogues and estimate the significance of the stacked signal in the same\nway as in the real catalogue. This is then repeated 10 000 times to\nobtain the distribution of the detection significances (as defined in\nSection 5) for the mock catalogues. This provides an estimate of\nthe probability of getting a statistically significant stacked signal by\nchance. The detection confidence levels estimated from the simula-\ntions are in excellent agreement with those shown in Table 3 based\non Poisson statistics.\nWe also investigate the possibility that the observed stacked signal\nis primarily due to a few bright X-ray sources below the detection\nthreshold. This is important, especially if some of these sources are\nAGN and hence, not representative of the \u2018normal\u2019 galaxy popula-\ntion studied in this paper. First, we find no evidence of broad emis-\nsion lines in the optical spectra of the galaxies used in the stacking\nanalysis. Therefore, the obtained stacked signal does not include\nany contribution from powerful AGN\/QSOs, although we cannot\nexclude the possibility of weak and\/or heavily obscured AGN being\npresent in the sample. We further explore this issue by assigning\ndetection significances to individual 2dFGRS and then excluding\nsources above a given threshold. The detection significance for each\nsource is defined as the ratio of net source counts to the square root\nof the background. We note that this definition of detection signifi-\ncance is different from that used by the WAVDETECT task.\nFor the whole sample we need to remove galaxies above 2.7\u03c3\n(a total of 11) to obtain a low-confidence level signal (2.6\u03c3 ). The\n11 sources that appear to dominate the stacking signal have mean\nf X\/ f B \u2248 \u22122 and LX (0.5\u20132 keV) \u22481041 erg s\u22121, suggesting that the\ncontribution from AGN is small. Moreover, the optical spectra of the\nsystems that appear to dominate the stacking signal do not show any\nevidence for AGN activity (e.g. broad or high excitation lines). The\ncorresponding cut-offs for a low-confidence stacked signal in the\nspiral and elliptical subsamples is 3\u03c3 . Deeper X-ray observations\nare required to further address this issue.\nFinally, we note that for the stacked signal we estimate an X-ray-\nto-optical flux ratio log f X\/ f B \u2248 \u22122.5 typical of \u2018normal\u2019 galaxies\nand LX \u2248 1040 erg s\u22121 similar to that of Milky Way-type galaxies.\nThis also suggests that any contribution from AGN in the stacking\nanalysis is small. However, we note that the present data cannot\nbe used to identify and exclude from the stacking analysis weak or\nheavily obscured AGN that do not manifest their presence in the\noptical galaxy spectra. For example, Comastri et al. (2002) have\nidentified a class of X-ray bright optically inactive galaxies with\noptical spectra typical of \u2018normal\u2019 early-type systems and X-ray\nproperties indicative of obscured AGN activity. Our sample is likely\nto be contaminated by such systems. We note that because of their\nearly-type optical spectra, sources like those found by Comastri\net al. (2002) are likely to primarily affect the elliptical rather than\nthe spiral galaxy subsample.\n7 D I S C U S S I O N\n7.1 Optical-to-X-ray flux ratio\nShapley, Fabbiano & Eskridge (2001) studied the X-ray properties\nof a large sample of local spirals using Einstein archival data. They\nperformed multivariate statistical analysis and report a non-linear\ncorrelation between optical and X-ray luminosities LX \u2248 L3\/2B in-\ndependent of spectral type. This contradicts previous studies, based\non smaller samples, that found an almost linear LX\u2013LB relation,\ninterpreted as evidence for a link between X-rays and the evolved\nstellar population. To explain the non-linearity in LX\u2013LB Fabbiano\n& Shapley (2002) suggest two different processes affecting the X-\nray emission of early- and late-type spirals: the presence of a hot\ninterstellar medium similar to that of E\/S0 in early types and dust\nobscuration in star-forming regions in late types.\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS, MNRAS 344, 161\u2013168\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n166 A. Georgakakis et al.\nBrandt et al. (2001b) performed a stacking analysis on a sample\nof 17 z \u2248 0.5 \u2018normal\u2019 galaxies (both early and late type) using a\n500-ks Chandra exposure of the HDF-N region. They estimate a\nmean 0.5\u20132 keV luminosity for the spiral galaxies in their sample\nof LX =8.5 \u00d7 1039erg s\u22121 consistent with the calculations in the\npresent paper. This LX is elevated compared with local spirals but\nthis is attributed to the increased mean LB in their sample rather\nthan evolution. Similarly, Hornschemeier et al. (2002a) used stack-\ning analysis techniques to study the X-ray properties of the spiral-\nand irregular-type systems in the Chandra Deep Field North at red-\nshifts z \u2248 0.4\u20131.5. They argue that the mean LX\/LB in their sample\nis elevated compared with that of Shapley et al. (2001) (selected to\nspan the same LB range), suggesting evolution. However, the uncer-\ntainties in their LX\/LB estimates do not allow firm conclusions to be\ndrawn.\nThe present sample with well-defined selection criteria is inter-\nmediate in redshift (z \u2248 0.1) to that of Shapley et al. (2001) z \u2248\n0.004) and Hornschemeier et al. (2002a, z > 0.4), providing a low-z\nreference point for comparison with higher-z studies. Fig. 2 plots the\nlog LX\/LB against redshift, comparing the results from the studies\nabove. For the Shapley et al. (2001) spirals the median LX\/LB is esti-\nmated using galaxies over the same range of LB as the present spiral\ngalaxy subsample. Within the uncertainties there is fair agreement\nin the LX\/LB of local and z \u2248 0.1 2dFGRS spirals.\nMoreover, it is clear from Fig. 2 that the LX\/LB of z \u2248 0.1 spi-\nrals in the present study are also consistent, within the errors, with\nthose of Hornschemeier et al. (2002a) at z = 0.4\u20131. Although the\nmean LX of their spirals increases with redshift from z \u2248 0.4 to 1\nthis is compensated by a similar increase in the mean LB. At z > 1\nHornschemeier et al. (2002a) find that both LX\/LB and LX are el-\nevated compared with our estimates by a factor of 4, suggesting\nevolution. Although the large errors hamper a secure interpretation,\nit should be noted that this increase, if real, cannot be attributed to\ndifferences in LB between our sample and that of Hornschemeier\net al. (2002a) at z> 1. Therefore, our analysis combined with the\nresults of Hornschemeier et al. (2002a) suggest little or no evolution\nof the spiral galaxy LX relative to LB at least to z \u2248 1.\nFigure 2. log LX\/LB against redshift of spiral galaxies. The stacking anal-\nysis results for the 2dFGRS spirals are shown with the filled circle. The\ntriangle is the median log LX\/LB of local spirals (Shapley et al. 2001) se-\nlected to span an LB range similar to that of the present sample. For this point\nthe error bars correspond to the 25th and 75th percentile of the log LX\/LB\ndistribution of the Shapley et al. (2001) local spiral galaxy sample. The\nsquares are the stacking analysis results for distant late-type galaxies in the\nChandra Deep Field North (squares, Hornschemeier et al. 2002a).\n7.2 X-ray emissivity and star formation rate\nThe emissivity of galaxy samples selected at various wavelengths\n[ultraviolet (UV), optical, radio] over a range of redshifts is one\nof the most powerful and widely used evolutionary tests (e.g. Lilly\net al. 1996; Connolly et al. 1997). The X-ray emissivity, jX, of dif-\nferent galaxy types (including non-AGN-dominated systems) has\nbeen estimated locally by Georgantopoulos, Basilakos & Plionis\n(1999). However, the evolution of jX at higher redshifts is still\npoorly constrained, mainly because \u2018normal\u2019 galaxies are faint at\nX-ray wavelengths and their detection, especially at high redshift,\nis difficult even with the improved sensitivities of the XMM\u2013Newton\nand the Chandra observatories.\nThe 2dFGRS sample at z \u2248 0.1 can provide, for the first time, a\nnon-local estimate of the X-ray emissivity of \u2018normal\u2019 galaxies. For\nthe jX determination, we first need to estimate the effective cosmo-\nlogical volume probed by the 2dFGRS survey corrected for optical\nmagnitude incompleteness (e.g. bj < 19.4 mag) using the standard\n1\/V max formalism (e.g. Lilly et al. 1996). Corrections have also been\napplied taking into account incompleteness of the 2dFGRS sample\ndue to both poor signal-to-noise (S\/N) ratio spectra (Q < 3, unclas-\nsified objects) at faint magnitudes and instrumental limitations (e.g.\nfibre collisions) that did not allow a fraction of the target galaxies\nto be observed. We further assume that all 2dFGRS galaxies of a\ngiven spectral type have the same mean LX\/LB ratio estimated in\nSection 6.\nFor 2dFGRS spirals we estimate a soft band 0.5\u20132 keV emis-\nsivity of (0.4 \u00b1 0.3) \u00d7 1038 in fair agreement with that of local\nH II galaxies, (0.50 \u00b1 0.06) \u00d7 1038 erg s\u22121 Mpc\u22123, estimated by\nGeorgantopoulos et al. (1999; j scaled to the 0.5\u20132 keV band). For\nthe elliptical galaxy subsample we find jX = (1.2 \u00b1 0.4) \u00d7 1038 erg\ns\u22121 Mpc\u22123. Although the uncertainties are large this is higher than\nthe jX of local passive galaxies, (0.53 \u00b1 0.06) \u00d7 1038 erg s\u22121 Mpc\u22123,\nestimated by Georgantopoulos et al. (1999). These authors con-\nvolved the local optical luminosity function of the Ho, Filippenko\n& Sargent (1995) sample with the corresponding LX\u2013LB relation\nbased on Einstein data. The sample of Ho et al. (1995) has the ad-\nvantage of high S\/N ratio nuclear optical spectra and hence, reliable\nspectral classifications (Ho, Filippenko & Sargent 1997) necessary\nto study the properties of non-AGN galaxies.\nAssuming the same mean 0.5\u20132 keV X-ray flux (estimated from\nstacking; see Table 1) for all 2dFGRS spiral galaxies and an incom-\npleteness of \u224870 per cent (see Section 3) we estimate their XRB\ncontribution to be \u22480.4 per cent. This calculation assumes that the\nspectrum of the diffuse X-ray background follows the form 9 \u00d7\nE\u22120.4 keV cm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121 keV\u22121 (Gendreau et al. 1995). This small\nXRB fraction produced by \u2018normal\u2019 spirals at z \u2248 0.1 is broadly\nconsistent with studies of \u2018normal\u2019 galaxies at higher redshifts us-\ning deep X-ray surveys. Hornschemeier et al. (2002a) argue that they\nhave identified \u22481 per cent of the soft XRB as arising from spirals\nnot individually detected in deep Chandra surveys. Alexander et al.\n(2002) studied X-ray-detected starbursts in the redshift range 0.4\u2013\n1.3 and argued that they produce \u22482 per cent of the 0.5\u20138 keV\nXRB.\nIn addition to the above observational constraints, a number of\nstudies attempt to predict the total XRB fraction produced by an\nevolving population of star-forming galaxies. Ranalli et al. (2003)\nused a nearby well-defined sample of star-forming galaxies with\navailable ASCA and BeppoSAX data to derive an almost linear rela-\ntion between X-ray luminosity and radio power. Using this correla-\ntion and the radio source counts at sub-mJy flux densities (believed\nto be dominated by starbursts) they predict the contribution of these\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS, MNRAS 344, 161\u2013168\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nThe XMM\u2013Newton\/2dF survey \u2013 I 167\nsystems to the XRB. Integrating their predicted soft band (0.5\u2013\n2 keV) X-ray source counts we estimate a 0.5\u20132 keV XRB fraction\nproduced by starbursts in the range \u224810\u201315 per cent depending\non the faint flux limit of the integration. Persic & Rephaeli (2003)\ncarefully modelled the X-ray spectral energy distribution of nearby\nstar-forming galaxies to estimate a 2\u201310 keV XRB contribution of\n5\u201311 per cent depending on the assumed evolution. Although they\ndo not estimate the soft band XRB contribution the fractions above\nwill increase at softer energies. Griffiths & Padovani (1990) con-\nverted the 60-\u00b5m luminosity function of IRAS star-forming galax-\nies to X-ray wavelengths and argued that star-forming galaxies with\nmild evolution could produce 20\u201330 per cent of the XRB. Similarly,\nPearson et al. (1997) used IRAS star-forming galaxies to fit the X-\nray counts at faint flux limits and estimated that such systems could\ncontribute as much as 30\u201350 per cent of the XRB. The studies above\nclearly demonstrate that there is significant uncertainty in the XRB\nfraction produced by star-forming galaxies critically depending on\nthe adopted evolution.\nThe present study of spiral galaxies to z \u2248 0.1 cannot on its own be\nused to either constrain the evolution of these systems with z or esti-\nmate their total XRB contribution extrapolated to high z. However,\ncomparison of our results at z \u2248 0.1 with those obtained at higher\nredshifts (e.g. Hornschemeier et al. 2002a) indicate X-ray evolution\nfor these systems. Indeed, the almost constant LX\/LB versus z re-\nlation in Fig. 2 can be interpreted as evidence that LX evolves at\nleast at the same rate as LB. It is an interesting exercise to attempt\nto constrain the X-ray evolution of star-forming galaxies using the\nX-ray emissivity of 2dFGRS spirals at z \u2248 0.1 and assuming that\nthe bulk of the soft XRB that remains unaccounted for in deep X-ray\nsurveys is produced by star-forming processes. Deep ROSAT sur-\nveys (Hasinger et al. 1998) to the limit \u224810\u221215 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 have\nresolved 68\u201381 per cent of the soft (<2 KeV) XRB into discrete\nsources. Most of them are AGN (8 per cent, Schmidt et al. 1998)\nwith a small fraction being galaxy groups or clusters (6 per cent,\nLehmann et al. 2001). More recently, deep Chandra surveys (e.g.\nMushotzky et al. 2000; Brandt 2001; Giacconi et al. 2002) extended\nthe study of the X-ray source population to the limits \u224810\u221217\u201310\u221216\nerg s\u22121 cm\u22122. For example, Mushotzky et al. (2000) resolved 6\u201313\nper cent of the soft band XRB to sources also believed to be AGN\nwith fluxes in the range \u224810\u221216\u201310\u221215 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122. Only a small\nfraction of the XRB (1\u20132 per cent) is believed to be produced by\nstar-forming galaxies at the flux limits of the ultradeep Chandra\nsurveys (Alexander et al. 2002; Hornschemeier et al. 2002a). The\nevidence above suggests that 74\u201396 per cent of the soft band XRB\nhas been resolved and is produced by AGN, groups or clusters al-\nlowing a maximum of 6\u201326 per cent to star-forming galaxies. We\nemploy the spiral galaxy jX at z \u2248 0.1 to constrain the maximum\nallowed evolution for these systems. Under the assumption that the\nX-ray emissivity follows the form (1 + z)k to a maximum forma-\ntion redshift zmax = 4, we find that the index k should be <1.5\nand <3.2 for the XRB fraction produced by these systems to be\n<6 and <26 per cent, respectively. We note that surveys at optical\nwavelengths estimate k \u2248 3 (e.g. Lilly et al. 1996).\nWe stress that the XRB fraction due to star-forming galaxies\nquoted above (and hence, the derived evolution parameter k) is an\nupper limit. Although, a number of studies suggest that as much as\n20\u201350 per cent of the XRB could be produced by starbursts (e.g.\nGriffiths & Padovani 1990; Pearson et al. 1997) more recent esti-\nmates suggest modest soft band fractions (e.g. Persic & Rephaeli\n2003; Ranalli et al. 2003). Deep wide field surveys selecting star-\nforming galaxies at higher redshifts using homogeneous and well-\ndefined criteria are required to constrain the X-ray evolution of these\nsystems and hence, their XRB contribution. This paper provides\nsuch a sample at low redshifts for comparison with future studies.\nFinally, the X-ray emission of spirals not dominated by AGN\nis associated with the star formation activity of the parent galaxy\n(Read & Ponman 2001; Fabbiano & Shapley 2002). Consequently,\nthe X-ray emission of these systems can be used to probe both the\nindividual and the global star formation rate. However, the quan-\ntitative link between X-ray luminosity and SFR is rather tenuous,\ndepending on poorly constrained parameters such as the initial mass\nfunction and the nature of the stellar sources responsible for the\nX-ray emission (e.g. Ghosh & White 2001). More theoretical and\nobservational work is clearly needed in this field. Here, we adopt the\nempirical 0.5\u20132 keV X-ray luminosity to SFR conversion derived\nby Ranalli et al. (2003). For the X-ray luminosity of the spirals in\nthe present sample we find a mean SFR of \u22481.3 M\b yr\u22121, while the\nstar formation density of the present sample at z \u2248 0.1 is \u2248 0.009 \u00b1\n0.007 M\b yr\u22121 Mpc\u22123. This is lower than previous estimates using\ngalaxy samples selected at different wavelengths. However, given\nthe large uncertainties involved in converting X-ray luminosity to\nstar formation rate the agreement is surprising. This suggests that\ndeep X-ray surveys detecting an increasing number of \u2018normal\u2019\ngalaxies can be used as probes of the SFR of individual systems.\n8 C O N C L U S I O N S\nIn this paper we study the mean X-ray properties of \u2018normal\u2019 galax-\nies using stacking analysis techniques. We use a shallow (2\u201310 ks)\nXMM\u2013Newton survey covering an area of \u22481.5 deg2 and overlap-\nping with the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey. The 2dFGRS sample has\nthe advantage of high-quality spectra and hence, accurate redshifts\nand reliable classifications into early- and late-type galaxies.\nIn the stacking analysis we use a sample of \u2248200 2dFGRS galax-\nies with a mean redshift of z \u2248 0.1. In the soft 0.5\u20132 keV band we\ndetect a statistically significant signal for both the whole sample\n(\u22486\u03c3 ) and the early- (\u22484\u03c3 ) and late- (\u22483\u03c3 ) type galaxy subsam-\nples. In contrast, no signal is detected for any of the above samples\nin the hard 2\u20138 keV band. The main conclusions from this study are\nsummarized below.\n(i) We find that the mean LX\/LB ratio of the present sample at\nz \u2248 0.1 is consistent within the errors with both local (<100 Mpc)\nand distant (z \u2248 1) samples after accounting for differences in the\nmean LB of the samples. This suggests little or no evolution of the\nX-ray emission mechanisms relative to the optical emission at least\nto z \u2248 1.\n(ii) The mean X-ray emissivity, jX, of \u2018normal\u2019 galaxies at z \u2248\n0.1 is found to be consistent with that of local H II samples. We also\nfind that the present sample of 2dFGRS spirals contributes about\n0.4 per cent to the soft band XRB. This low fraction is in broad\nagreement with previous studies estimating the XRB produced by\nstar-forming spirals at moderate redshifts.\n(iii) For star-forming galaxies assuming an X-ray luminosity\nevolution of the form (1 + z)k to a maximum redshift zmax = 4\nwe find k < 3. The k values are constrained by the relatively low\nfraction of the soft X-ray background that remains unresolved by\ndeep surveys (6\u201326 per cent). Higher k values will result in an over-\nproduction of the soft X-ray background given the fraction already\nattributed to AGN, groups and clusters.\n(iv) Using the mean X-ray properties of the spiral galaxy subsam-\nple and assuming an empirical X-ray luminosity to SFR conversion\nfactor we estimate a global SFR density of 0.009 \u00b1 0.007 M\b yr\u22121\nMpc\u22123 at z \u2248 0.1. Although the uncertainties are large this is lower\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS, MNRAS 344, 161\u2013168\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n168 A.
