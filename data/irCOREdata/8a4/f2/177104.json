Hydrocortisone treatment is widely used in septic shock though survival \nbenefit has only been reported in patients remaining hypotensive after fluid and \nvasopressor resuscitation whose plasma cortisol fails to rise appropriately to corticotropin. \nThis study assessed outcome effects of hydrocortisone in a general septic shock \npopulation. \nMETHODS. Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 50 mg \nintravenous hydrocortisone (or placebo) every 6 hours for 5 days, then tapered off over six \ndays. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality in corticotropin nonresponders. \nRESULTS. Five hundred patients were recruited of whom 499 (251 hydrocortisone, 248 \nplacebo) were analyzable. Of these, 233 (46.7%) were corticotropin nonresponders (125 \nhydrocortisone, 108 placebo). No difference in 28-day mortality was seen in \nnonresponders (39.2% hydrocortisone, 36.1% placebo; p=0.69), or responders (28.8% \nhydrocortisone, 28.7% placebo; p=1.00). Overall, 86\/251 (34.3%) hydrocortisone and \n78\/248 (31.5%) placebo patients died by 28 days (p=0.51). Hydrocortisone hastened the \ntime to shock reversal in nonresponders (p =0.056), responders (p=0.0001) and all \npatients (p=0.0004). However, it failed to increase the proportion of patients with shock \n 5\nreversal in the total population or either corticotropin subset. There were more episodes of \nsuperinfection including new sepsis or septic shock in the hydrocortisone group. Only 500 \nrather than the projected 800 patients were enrolled because of slow recruitment, \ntermination of funding and time expiry of the trial drug. \nCONCLUSIONS. Hydrocortisone failed to improve survival or shock reversal in a general \nseptic shock population, either overall or in corticotropin-nonresponders, though it did \nhasten shock recovery. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00147004). \nAbstract word count- 250 \n 6\n \nSevere sepsis is a major worldwide cause of mortality and morbidity 1,2 Septic shock, \nthe most severe manifestation, occurs in 2-20% of inpatients.3  Its incidence is rising 4 and \na mortality of 33-61% is reported in the placebo group of recent multicenter trials. 5,6,7,8  \nThe use of corticosteroids as an adjunctive therapy has been controversial for \ndecades. 9 After the Schumer study,10 high-dose, short-course glucocorticoids became \naccepted therapy. Subsequent studies, however, failed to confirm survival benefit with this \nregimen and suggested an increase in superinfection-related mortality.11-13 Recent studies \nusing lower doses (200-300 mg per day) of hydrocortisone for longer durations reported \nearlier reversal of shock 14-18 and improved survival. 14,16 This was particularly apparent in \nnonresponders to corticotropin, the prognostic importance of which had been previously \nrecognized in critical illness.19,20  Recent meta-analyses 21,22 , reviews 20 and guidelines 23 \nhave advocated the use of \u2018low-dose\u2019 hydrocortisone in septic shock. These \nrecommendations were primarily based on a study of septic shock patients remaining \nhypotensive after at least one hour of resuscitation with fluids and vasopressors,16 in \nwhich survival benefit was seen in corticotropin nonresponders receiving hydrocortisone \nand fludrocortisone. The CORTICUS study evaluated the efficacy and safety of low-dose \n 7\nhydrocortisone therapy in a broader septic shock population, in particular patients \nresponding to corticotropin in whom benefit was unproven. 9  \n 8\nMethods \nExperimental design and study organization \nThis was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The \nprotocol was approved by the Ethics Committees of the 52 participating intensive care \nunits (ICUs). Patients were enrolled from March 2002 until November 30, 2005. An \nIndependent Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) met after each of three interim \nanalyses. At study end, a Clinical Evaluation Committee blindly assessed the \nappropriateness of anti-infective treatments.  \n \nPatients \nPatients of 18 years of age or above and hospitalized in participating ICUs were \nprospectively enrolled in the study if they met all eligibility criteria (Supplementary \nAppendix Table 1). Inclusion criteria included: (1) Clinical evidence of infection, (2) \nEvidence of a systemic response to infection, (3) Evidence of shock within the previous 72 \nhours defined by a systolic blood pressure (SBP) <90 mmHg despite adequate fluid \nreplacement OR need for vasopressors for at least one hour, and hypoperfusion or organ \n 9\ndysfunction attributable to sepsis, and (4) Informed consent according to local regulations. \nNotable exclusion criteria included underlying disease with a poor prognosis, moribund \npatients likely to die within 24 hours, immunosuppression and prior administration of \ncorticosteroids. \n \nRandomization \nRandomization (1:1) was stratified by center in blocks of four using a computer \nrandom number generator list provided by a statistician not involved in eligibility \ndeterminations, treatment administration or outcome assessments. In each center, study \nmedication (hydrocortisone or placebo) sealed in sequentially numbered identical boxes \ncontained the entire treatment for each patient to be administered sequentially. The \nsequence was concealed to investigators. All patients, medical and nursing staffs, \npharmacists, investigators and members of the DSMB remained blinded throughout the \nstudy period. \n \nTreatments \n 10\nHydrocortisone was prepared (Rotexmedica, Trittau, Germany) in vials containing \n100 mg of hydrocortisone hemisuccinate powder with ampoules containing 2 ml of sterile \nwater diluent and then coded and blinded centrally (Klocke Verpackungs-Service GmbH, \nWeingarten, Germany). Placebo was indiscernible from active treatment. Study drug was \nadministered as a 50 mg intravenous bolus every six hours for 5 days, then tapered to 50 \nmg intravenously every 12 hours for days 6-8, 50 mg every 24 hours for days 9-11 and \nthen stopped. A total of 29 doses were given. Evidence-based guidelines for patient \nmanagement were encouraged. 24 \n \nDefinitions  \nOrgan system failure was defined for each of the 6 major organ systems as a \nSequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of 3 or 4 points. 25 Reversal of shock \nwas defined as the maintenance of a SBP \u226590 mmHg without vasopressor support for \u226524 \nhours.  Superinfection was defined as a new infection occurring \u226548 hours after study \nmedication commenced. 26 New sepsis was defined as a new septic episode with or \nwithout microbiological confirmation. New septic shock was defined as a new septic shock \n 11\nepisode after reversal of the initial septic shock. Nonresponders to \uf020the corticotropin test \nwere defined by a cortisol increase \u22649 \u00b5g\/dl (248 nmol\/l). 16  \n \nData collection at inclusion \nClinical evaluation. The following data were recorded: 1) general characteristics including \ndemographics, diagnoses and recent surgery, 2) severity of illness assessed by vital \nsigns, Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II, 27 and SOFA score, 25 and 3) \ninterventions including type and doses of vasopressors, antibiotics and adjunctive \ntreatment such as corticosteroids and etomidate. \nLaboratory variables. Hematological and chemistry data, blood gas determinations, and \ncultures of blood and other specimens drawn from potential sites of infection were \nrecorded. A short corticotropin test was performed using blood samples taken immediately \nbefore and 60 minutes after an intravenous bolus of 0.25 mg tetracosactrin (Novartis, \nNuremberg, Germany or Alliance, Chippenham, UK). After centrifugation, serum samples \nwere stored at -20\u00b0C or below until assayed. To red uce heterogeneity in cortisol \ndetermination, all samples were measured blindly and serially before interim and final \n 12\nanalyses in a central laboratory using the ELECSYS Cortisol assay\u00ae (Roche Diagnostics, \nMannheim\/Penzberg, Germany).  \n \nFollow-up \nDuring the 28-day period post-randomization, data were collected for vital signs, \nresults from laboratory tests and cultures of specimens drawn from any new site of \ninfection and any major interventions performed. Mortality at 28 days, discharge from ICU, \nhospital and at one year after randomization were recorded. \n \nEndpoints \nThe primary endpoint was 28-day mortality in nonresponders to the corticotropin test.  \nSecondary endpoints determined a priori were (i) 28-day mortality in responders to \ncorticotropin and in all patients, (ii) ICU, hospital and one-year mortality, (iii) organ system \nfailure reversal including shock, and (iv) ICU and hospital stay. \n 13\nSafety was assessed by recording adverse events particularly superinfection, \ngastrointestinal bleeding, hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, clinical muscular weakness, \nstroke, acute myocardial infarction and peripheral ischemia.  \nMethods to enhance quality of measurements included biannual investigator \nmeetings, newsletters and random quality assurance evaluations. \n \nStatistical methods \nA sample size of 800 (400 patients per group) was needed to achieve 80% statistical \npower to detect an absolute decrease in mortality of 10% from an existing mortality rate of \n50% in the corticotropin nonresponder group (40% in the total group).  \nAll analyses were performed according to a pre-established plan. The population \nwas analyzed by an \u201cintention to treat\u201d principle. Twenty-eight day all-cause mortality was \nanalyzed by the Fisher\u2019s exact test for differences between treatment groups. A maximum \noverall two-sided probability of a type-I error of 5% was accepted. The test result was \ncorrected for two interim analyses for efficacy. Splitting the alpha error function was \nperformed according to the method of O'Brian and Flemming (p=0.0006, p=0.005 and \n 14\np=0.047 for the first, second and final analysis, respectively). Twenty-eight day mortality \nwas significantly different if the stopping criteria of the interim analysis were met or the \ntwo-sided p value of the final analysis was <0.047. All other secondary efficacy variables \nwere assumed to be significantly different for p-values <0.05. Cumulative survival Kaplan-\nMeier curves during the 28-day observation period were constructed and compared using \nthe log-rank test. Median time to reversal of septic shock was calculated by Kaplan-Meier \nanalysis. Adverse events were reported for the per protocol population. Multivariate \nanalyses of the 28-day mortality were carried out by logistic regression models. \n \n 15\nResults \n \nStudy patients \nFive hundred patients were enrolled (Figure 1).  One patient in the hydrocortisone \ngroup was excluded because consent was withdrawn.  Of the remaining 499 patients, all \npatients met entry criteria though 15 fulfilled exclusion criteria (8 hydrocortisone, 7 placebo \npatients) as 14 had received previous steroids and one had undergone prior CPR. Eighty-\nseven percent of both placebo and active groups received \u226590% of study drug. \nThere were 233 (46.7%) corticotropin nonresponders (hydrocortisone 125; placebo \n108) and 254 (50.9%) responders (hydrocortisone 118; placebo 136). Results were \nunknown in 12 (2.4%) patients (hydrocortisone 8; placebo 4). Etomidate was used in 51 \n(20%) hydrocortisone and 45 (18%) placebo patients before study entry, and in 22 (9%) \nand 20 (8%) after study enrollment. More of the patients receiving etomidate were \nnonresponders [58\/96 (60%) versus 175\/403 (43%)]. The median time between the last \ndose of etomidate and enrollment was 14 (range:1-67) hours.  \n 16\nAt baseline, the two groups were well balanced for demographics (Table 1), clinical \ncharacteristics (Table 2), and the type and site of infection and infecting organisms \n(Supplementary Appendix Table 2). \n \nMain Outcomes   \nMortality \nThe primary outcome of 28-day mortality in corticotropin nonresponders revealed no \ndifference between the hydrocortisone [49 deaths (39.2%; 95% CI: 30.5-47.9%)] and \nplacebo [39 deaths (36.1%; 95% CI: 26.9-45.3%)] groups. Likewise, no difference was \nseen in 28-day mortality in corticotropin responders with 34 (28.8%; 95% CI: 20.6-37.0%) \nand 39 (28.7%; 95% CI:21.1-36.3%) deaths in the hydrocortisone and placebo groups, \nrespectively. Overall, there were 86 deaths (34.3%; 95% CI: 28.3-40.2%) in the \nhydrocortisone group and 78 deaths (31.5%; 95% CI: 25.6-37.3%) in the placebo group.  \nNo mortality differences were seen between groups (or in responder\/nonresponder \nsubsets) at any other time point. Kaplan Meier survival curves are shown in Figures 2a-c \nand odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals in Table 3. Post hoc analysis showed a \nmortality rate of 31\/69 (45%) in steroid-treated patients vs. 32\/57 (56%) in placebo \n 17\npatients (difference \u201311% (95% CI: -18.6 to 6.2%), p=0.28) with SBP persisting <90 \nmmHg within 30 hours of study entry, and 55\/181 (30%) in steroid-treated vs. 46\/189 \n(24%) in placebo patients (difference 6% (95%CI: -3.0 to 15.1%), p=0.20) with SBP >90 \nmmHg within 30 hours of study entry. Post hoc analysis of the 198 patients receiving study \ndrug within 12 hours from baseline, demonstrated a similar mortality rate of 71\/198 (36%) \nin steroid-treated patients vs. 57\/186 (31%) in placebo patients. \n A post-hoc analysis revealed a trend to increased mortality in patients who received \netomidate pre-randomization in both groups [23\/51 (45%) hydrocortisone vs. 18\/45 (40%) \nplacebo] vs. not receiving etomidate [63\/200 (32%) hydrocortisone vs. 60\/203 (30%) \nplacebo]. A logistic regression model adjusting for the treatment group (steroid\/placebo), \nresponse to corticotropin (responder\/non-responder), cortisol-baseline value (as \ncontinuous variable) and SAPS II Score revealed a p-value of 0.053 for the effect of \netomidate. \n \n \nReversal of shock  \n 18\nThe proportion of shock reversal was similar for nonresponders [95\/125 (76.0%; 95% \nCI: 68.5-83.5%) hydrocortisone, 76\/108 (70.4%; 95% CI: 61.8-79.0%) placebo, p = 0.41]; \nresponders [100\/118 (84.7%; 95% CI: 78.3-91.2%) hydrocortisone, 104\/136 (76.5%; 95% \nCI: 69.3-83.6%) placebo, p = 0.13]; or all patients [200\/251 (79.7%; 95% CI: 74.7-84.7%) \nhydrocortisone, 184\/248 (74.2%; 95% CI: 68.7-79.6%) placebo, p = 0.18]. Differences in \nshock reversal between hydrocortisone and placebo groups with relative risks (95% CI) for \nnonresponders, responders and all patients respectively, were 5.6% -5.8-17.0%) and 1.08 \n(0.92-1.26), 8.3% -1.4-17.9%) and 1.11 (0.98-1.25), 5.5% (-1.9-12.9%) and 1.07 (0.98-\n1.18) in favor of hydrocortisone.Time to shock reversal was significantly shorter in patients \nreceiving hydrocortisone, for the overall group (p=0.0004), responders (p=0.0001) and \nnonresponders (p=0.0.056) (Figures 3a-c). The median time (95% CI) to shock reversal \nwas shorter in the hydrocortisone group: for all patients 3.3 days (2.9-3.9) vs. 5.8 days \n(5.2-6.9); responders 2.8 days (2.1-3.3) vs. 5.8 days (5.2-6.9); and nonresponders 3. 9 \ndays (3.0-5.2) vs. 6.0 days (4.9-9.0).  \nThe number of extubated patients on day 28 was similar in the hydrocortisone and \nplacebo groups, [119 (52%) vs. 113 (53%), respectively]. For the 357 patients with \ncultured pathogens for their primary infection, the Clinical Evaluation Committee's \n 19\ndetermined appropriate antimicrobial therapy for 126 of 173 (73%) steroid and 145 of 184 \n(79%) placebo treated patients. There was no difference between treatment groups nor \noutcome differences between patients receiving appropriate or inappropriate antibiotic \ntherapy. \n \nuseand other drug  Steroid \nEleven patients (4%) in the hydrocortisone group and 10 (4%) in the placebo group \nreceived steroids after study enrollment for allergic reactions, laryngeal edema, \nbronchospasm, brain edema, steroid replacement for chronic steroid therapy unknown at \nenrollment, acute respiratory distress syndrome and septic shock. Five patients received \nsteroids for septic shock after completion of the study drug course. The number of \npatients receiving activated protein C and antithrombin III was not different in the two \ngroups (Table 2).  \n \nAdverse events \nThere was an increased incidence of superinfections including new episodes of \nsepsis or septic shock [odds ratios (95% CI) of 1.37 (1.05-1.79)], hyperglycemia and \n 20\nhypernatremia in the hydrocortisone group (Table 4). Neuromuscular weakness was rarely \nreported.  \n 21\nDiscussion \nThis study found no impact of \u2018low-dose\u2019 hydrocortisone on 28-day mortality in septic \nshock patients, regardless of their adrenal responsiveness to corticotropin. Hydrocortisone \ndid not significantly affect overall shock reversal but it did hasten the time to shock \nreversal. \nThese results are in marked contrast to the Annane study 16 where improved survival \nand shock reversal were reported in corticotropin nonresponders receiving hydrocortisone \nplus fludrocortisone. Differences may relate to (i) dissimilar patient populations - the \nAnnane patients had higher SAPS II scores at baseline, an entry requirement of SBP <90 \nmmHg for >1 hour despite fluid and vasopressor therapy, and a much higher 28-day \nmortality in the placebo group (61% vs. 32% in CORTICUS); (ii) enrollment was only \nallowed within 8 hours of fulfilling entry criteria rather than the 72 hour window in \nCORTICUS; and (iii) fludrocortisone was not given in CORTICUS as 200mg \nhydrocortisone should provide adequate mineralocorticoid activity.28  Furthermore, \nabsorption of oral fludrocortisone is variable in the shock state. Although an analysis of \npatients with SBP persisting <90 mmHg at day 1 after fluid and vasopressor resuscitation \nshowed a placebo mortality of 56% and an absolute reduction in mortality of 11% in the \n 22\nhydrocortisone group, similar to that reported by Annane, 16 the subsets receiving study \ndrug within 12 hours from baseline did not demonstrate any outcome differences. \nAs reported previously, 14,15,18 a decrease in time to shock reversal with \nhydrocortisone was found in this study. However, the total number of patients achieving \nshock reversal was unaffected. It remains unclear why vascular tone improves in some \npatients but not others. Unexpectedly, earlier shock reversal was greater in corticotropin \nresponders but was not associated either with survival benefit or reduction in duration of \nICU or hospital stay. These findings may be unrelated to adrenal insufficiency but could \ninstead result from a direct interaction with mechanisms producing vascular hyporeactivity. \n29,30\n Alternatively, the effect may be due to a more widespread anti-inflammatory action of \nglucocorticoids, inhibiting expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, mediators and \nreceptors. 31   \nThe duration of steroid dosage may be pertinent, with any gain achieved by earlier \nshock reversal counterbalanced by later complications.9 Annane stopped corticosteroid \ntreatment abruptly after 7 days whereas, in CORTICUS, therapy was tapered from day 5 \nto day 11. Tapering was used because of the increase in pro-inflammatory mediators and \nhemodynamic deterioration after abrupt cessation of steroids. 17 The present study found \n 23\nan increased incidence of superinfections including new episodes of sepsis or septic \nshock in the hydrocortisone group. Previous studies with high dose steroids have shown \nsimilar findings.11  Interestingly, the ARDSnet study using higher dose steroids  32  and \nmeta-analyses of studies with low doses 21,22 did not report higher rates of infectious \ncomplications.  \nStudies in the critically ill have reported an association between steroid therapy and \nthe incidence of neuromuscular weakness. 32,33 This was not seen in CORTICUS although \nelectrophysiological testing was not performed. The duration of mechanical ventilation \nwas, however, similar in the two groups. Finally, the increased glucose levels in the \nhydrocortisone group may have contributed to an increased mortality. 34  \nThe use of etomidate for induction of anesthesia was similar to the Annane study16 \n(24% vs. 23% in CORTICUS). Etomidate has a low cardiovascular complication profile 35 \nbut a single dose can inhibit steroid metabolism for at least 24 hours in the critically ill. 36 \nAn association between etomidate and the likelihood of adrenal hyporesponsiveness was \nalso found in this study. \nThe prognostic importance of adrenal insufficiency in septic shock is well \ndescribed.19 Routine testing of adrenal function has been advocated to guide steroid \n 24\ntherapy. 16,18-21  In the present study a modest increase in 28-day mortality was seen in \ncorticotropin nonresponders (38% vs 29% in responders) but there was no outcome \ndifference with hydrocortisone treatment in either subset. The short corticotropin test does \nnot appear useful for determining steroid treatment in septic shock and the results \nquestion the definition of relative adrenal insufficiency. Indeed, significant variability in \ncortisol levels has been described depending on the measurement methodology used. 37  \nRecent studies have described the poor relationship between total and free cortisol levels \n38 and other issues concerning the dose, timing and type of corticotropin. 39   \nStrengths of the present study include the fact that it was a European-wide, \ninvestigator-initiated study including 52 ICUs from 9 countries. Practically all the \nCONSORT requirements for reporting randomized trials were met a central laboratory was \nused for measuring cortisol and quality assurance evaluations revealed few problems. \nLimitations of the study include the lack of adequate power as only 500 patients were \nenrolled rather than the projected 800. This was due to a combination of slow recruitment \nlikely related to a loss of equipoise in view of the various guidelines recommending steroid \nuse, 23 termination of funding, and time expiry of the trial drug. Based on the current data, \nhowever, the likelihood of seeing any difference in outcomes between the two groups was \n 25\nunlikely. Finally, 21 (4%) patients received open-label steroids though this is unlikely to \nhave materially affected the outcome.  \nIn summary, hydrocortisone did not decrease mortality in a general septic shock \npopulation despite hastening shock reversal. This lack of improvement may be related to \nan increased incidence of superinfections and new septic episodes. No benefit was seen \nin the corticotropin nonresponder subgroup, as was shown previously for patients with \nsevere septic shock. This may be related to methodological issues surrounding the \naccurate diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency in the critically ill or to a decreased prognostic \nimportance of this phenomenon in less severe shock. The short corticotropin test is not \nuseful in guiding steroid therapy. On the basis of these findings, hydrocortisone cannot be \nrecommended as general adjuvant therapy for septic shock (vasopressor responsive), nor \ncan corticotropin testing to determine who should receive it. Hydrocortisone may have a \nrole in patients treated early after the onset of septic shock who remain hypotensive \ndespite high dose vasopressors (vasopressor unresponsive). 16    \n \n 26\nReferences \n1.
