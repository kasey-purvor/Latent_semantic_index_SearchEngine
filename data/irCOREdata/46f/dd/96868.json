Introduction. Circadian rhythms provide a ubiquitous adaptation of \nmost eukaryotes and some prokaryotes to the environmental day and night \nalteration, and they express the working of a mysterious endogenous \noscillator, a clock-like mechanism that provides temporal organization. This \nclock-like mechanism (circadian pacemaker) functions autonomously but \ncan be entrained by environmental cyclic changes. \n517 \n518 R. A. BARRIO et al. \nThere have been great advances in the research of the clock mechanism \nduring this decade. Recent molecular studies, extensively performed on \nfruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and bread mold Neurospora crassa suggest \nthat the regulation of gene expression may lie at the heart of the clock \nmechanism (Hardin et al., 1990; Edery et al., 1994; Sehgal et al., 1995; \nGekakis et al., 1995; Myers et al., 1996; Lee et al., 1996). In the fruit fly, two \ngenes, per (for period, Konopka and Benzer, 1971) and tim (timeless, \nSehgal et aE., 1994) are essential components of the circadian clock. \nMutations in either of these genes can produce arrythmicity or change the \nperiod of the rhythm by several hours. The picture of how the per and tim \nproteins interact is far from complete, although it seems that they work as a \nteam to generate an oscillating cycle of activity in their genes and probably \nother genes, which in turn set up daily rhythms in the fly\u2019s physiology and \nactivity (Sehgal et al., 1995; Vosshall et al., 1994). \nIn mammals, the main circadian pacemaker is located in the suprachias- \nmatic nuclei (SCN) of the anterior hyphothalamus (for reviews, see Meijer \nand Rietveld, 1989; Moore, 1992). Disruption of SCN function by lesioning \nor surgical isolation abolishes circadian rythmicity, which can be restored \nby transplantation of fetal tissue into the third ventricle of SCN-lesioned \nhosts (Drucker-Colin et al., 1984; Lehman et al., 1987; Ralph et al., 1990). \nThe autonomous nature of the SCN pacemaker activity has been demon- \nstrated by evidences that the circadian rhythm in electrical activity persists \nwhen the SCN are isolated surgically from the rest of the hypothalamus \n(Inouye and Kawamura, 1979) or isolated in uitro (Gillette, 1991; Prosser \net al., 1990; Zhang and Aguilar-Roblero, 1995). However, what composes \nthe clock and how it is organized are currently matters of discussion. At \npresent two possibilities are apparent: either there is a class of pacemaker \ncells capable of sustaining a 24-hour oscillation individually in its own \nactivity, or the circadian pacemaker is an emergent property of circuit \ninteractions within the SCN. In this paper, we explore the latter possibility \nand shall discuss the former one at the end. \nSeveral mathematical models aiming to explain the circadian pacemaker \nfunction have been based on coupled cellular oscillators (Winfree, 1967; \nEnright, 1980; Pittendrigh, 1974; Pavlidis, 1969, 1975). These interacting \ncellular oscillators are thought to function by neuronal communication \nmediated by neurotransmitter release. However, the validity of these mod- \nels has been jeopardized by a series of experiments consisting of the \nadministration of tetrodotoxin (TTX) (see, for example, Schwartz et al, \n1987; Earnest et aZ., 1991; Newman et aZ., 1992). TTX can successfully block \nsodium-dependent action potentials, and therefore block the neurotrans- \nmitter release, but cannot alter the precision of the time-keeping machine. \nThese observations suggest that the classical sodium-dependent axonal \nneurotransmission may not be needed for the time-keeping machine. Thus, \nthe biological basis on which previous mathematical models are based is \nHIERARCHICALLY COUPLED ULTRADIAN OSCILLATORS 519 \ncalled into question. The ways in which an ultradian oscillation in the \ncellular level can induce a circadian rhythm is by no means clear, either \nexperimentally or theoretically. However, recent findings suggest that the \ncoupled oscillators idea cannot be ruled out. \nUltradian Ca2+ oscillations were recently found (Van den Pol et al., \n1992) in both neurons and glia cultured from SCN cells. The phase and \nperiod of glia Ca2+ oscillations are affected by several neurotransmitters, \nbut cannot be blocked by TTX. Astrocytes show very regular rhythms of \ncytoplasmic Ca2 + concentration with periods ranging from 7 to 20 sec. The \noscillating wave travels from one glia cell to another through gap junctions. \nThe intercellular wave can increase the period of the independently oscil- \nlating glia cells. The intracellular Ca2+ signalling in glial networks can \ndiscriminate the nature of the stimulus and possibly enable glial cells to \nperform long distance signalling. Moreover, this network can be modulated \nby activation of neuro-transmitter receptors, by nerve electrical activity, or \neven by the increase in [Ca2\u2019] itself. Ca2+ signals in glia can feed back on \nneurons (for review see Verkhratsky and Kettenmann, 1996). \nVan den Pol et al. (1992) proposed that the glia Ca2+ oscillations could \nbe the basis of the coupled oscillators generating the circadian signals. This \nopens a new perspective on the research of the clock machinery. Mathe- \nmatical modelling has suggested that high-frequency oscillators with peri- \nods within the same range as those shown in Van den Pol\u2019s paper may be \nthe basis for a low-frequency oscillator such as a circadian oscillator \n(Pavlidis, 1969; Winfree, 1975). However, there is an important feature that \ncannot be explained by the existing coupled oscillator models: the relative \nscale invariance of the circadian oscillator. \nThere are two SCN located at the anterior hypothalamus. It is clear that \neach nucleus can function as an independent oscillator, as ablation of one \nof them does not alter the circadian function (Van den Pol and Powley, \n1979). Similarly, ablation of an entire nucleus, and components of the \nother, does not eliminate circadian functions until at least 75% of both \nnuclei are destroyed (Van den Pol and Powley, 1979; Mosko and Moore, \n1979). Moreover, in vitro studies using hypothalamic SCN slices (usually \nabout 400-500 pm, representing less than 50% of the total volume) show \ncircadian oscillations of electrical activity and vasopressin release for sev- \neral circadian cycles without apparent effect on the phase or period of the \nrhythm (Gillette, 1991; Bos and Mirmiran, 1990; Watanabe et al., 1993; \nZhang and Aguilar-Roblero, 1995). Therefore, it is clear that there is \nredundancy in the SCN pacemaker. \nThe central issue that concerns us here is precisely this scale invariance, \nor the insensitivity of the period of the circadian rhythms to the number of \ncellular components of the regulating organ. On the one hand, one could \nmention a group of models with a small number of oscillators, but with \ncomplicated interconnections and feedbacks, tending to reproduce a spe- \n520 R. A. BARRIO et al. \ncific efferent behaviour of the clock (Carpenter and Grossberg, 1983). \nThese models successfully reproduce several features of the circadian \nrhythms, like phase locking, phase response curves and resetting by light, \nbut they do not address the important question of the origin of a circadian \nperiod. On the other hand, there is another group of mathematical models \nthat are based on a network of many individual non-linear oscillators, which \nare able to obtain a circadian period from ultradian oscillators (Pavlidis, \n1969). If the coupling is linear, then one can show quite generally that the \noutput period of the system of coupled oscillators varies as the square root \nof the number of participating units. From this point of view, they cannot \nexplain successfully the experimental data. In the present paper, we pro- \npose a new coupled-oscillator model that could explain the relative scale \ninvariance of the circadian clock. \n2. Theoretical Background-Large Systems of Coupled Oscillators. Our \npurpose is to demonstrate that a simple coupling of many &radian oscilla- \ntors (connected in the correct way) can exhibit circadian behaviour that is \nindependent of the number of components for a sufficiently large number \nof components. If we succeed, this theory will give support to the hypothesis \nthat biochemical ultradian oscillators are the origin of circadian rhythms. \nThe basic idea has been explored by Pavlidis (19691, who observed that a \nnetwork of many coupled linear oscillators has a mode (minimum eigen- \nvalue) of frequency very much smaller than the frequency of oscillation of \neach component. Consider a system of N interconnected linear oscillators, \nxk, k = 1,. . . N, satisfying \nN \ni~+w2x,-r~2~xi=o \ni=l \ni#k \n(1) \nwhere there are elastic (linear) couplings of strength r among all the \nidentical oscillators of natural frequency o. The system has a single mode \nof oscillation at the low frequency \ni2 = w&l - r(N - 1)) (2) \nfor the sum \ns= &,. \nk-l \n(3) \nThis can be seen by summing up all equations (11, and the eigenvector is \n0, 1, . . * , 1). There is another (N - l&degenerate mode at a high frequency \n(Y = OdM, with (N - 1) linearly independent eigenvectors satisfying \nHIERARCHICALLY COUPLED ULTRADIAN OSCILLATORS 521 \nCkxk = 0. Observe that if r becomes too large (a (iV - 1)-l>, then the \nsystem becomes unstable. The property displayed by equation (2) is re- \ntained by some non-linear systems used in biological modelling. For in- \nstance, consider a non-linear system of the type \n+ Ax = 0 (4) \nwhere x = (xi, x2,. . . , x,>~ and A is the matrix defining the elastic coupling. \nWhere \n~ I;;:j(X) =f ~ Xi ( I (5) j=l i=l \nfor all i, at least for the choice of an eigenvector column (1, 1, . . . , 1). That \nis, the system has elastic and frictional couplings that depend only on the \nsum of the outputs: \nn \ni,+f ik+w2xpyw2~xi=o. (6) \ni=l \ni+k \nIt is clear that the final frequency will still be given by equation (2). A \nproper choice of f will give a limit cycle with that frequency. Other \nextensions, considering only elastic coupling in equation (6) (that is, f = \nf(xk> only) have been examined numerically by Pavlidis (19691, and a \ndependence of the frequency on the parameter r(N - 11 is still observed in \nthe full non-linear model when r is sufficiently large to induce mutual \nentrainment. This led us to think that equation (2) is quite general. \nHowever, the behaviour of a general full non-linear system is impossible \nto describe. It could be argued that for biological systems it is very difficult \nto imagine a system of identical oscillators; therefore, it is useful to \nexamine a system with a distribution of frequencies. This has been done \nnumerically for a model of many simple limit-cycle oscillators (Matthews \net cd, 1991) considering a system with a general form for a supercritical \nHopf bifurcation: \ndzi z-= (l-lr,l~+iw,)~j+~,~~zi-zj~ Z-l (7) \nwhere zj is the position of the jth oscillator in the complex plane and wj \nare distributed at random according to a symmetrical frequency distribution \ng(w) around a mean Z. Among the diversity of complicated collective \n522 R. A. BARRIO et al. \nbehaviours, there are situations, for strong coupling, in which large-ampli- \ntude oscillations arise with a frequency smaller than the width of the \nfrequency distribution. \nIn any case, it seems that the problem is that the frequency of a \ncollective mode in a large system of coupled oscillators goes to zero as \nN + ~0. This actually contradicts the experimental findings that in the SCN \nthe frequency of the circadian oscillation is practically independent of the \nnumber of neurons or glias. Here, one has two choices: either one denies \nthat the circadian oscillation could be derived from ultradian oscillations \n(like the observed biochemical oscillations), or one proposes a system in \nwhich one is able to show a scale invariant frequency. \n3. The Model. Suppose that we have a slightly non-linear system of the \ntype of equation (6), This seems to be a very stringent condition, that we \nhave to relax, but for the sake of simplicity, let us first consider this case. \nLet us change the connections to form an arbitrary network with elastic \ninteractions between pairs. We know that the Hamiltonian of the linear \nsystem possesses a continuous symmetry, that is, it is invariant if one \nreplaces xk by xk + 6. When this symmetry is broken by a mode of finite \nwavelength, one expects the presence of acoustic waves, whose frequency \ngoes continuously to zero as the system becomes infinite. If the non-linear- \nity is unable to change this property, one has to conclude that any arbitrary \nnetwork of elastic springs has a low-frequency mode that approaches zero \ncontinuously as the size of the network increases. One way to get rid of this \nunwanted feature is to use a non-linear system of coupled pendulums \n(Winfree, 19671, or to capacitively couple limit-cycle oscillators (Othmer \nand Watanabe, 1992). Another way of stabilizing a low but non-zero \nfrequency, without changing the elastic nature of the interaction, is to \nspecify a hierarchical interconnection, that is, to consider that the oscilla- \ntors are interconnected in different levels of organization. \nSuppose that at the first level only a small number of ultradian oscillators \nwith natural frequency o. are coupled elastically with strength r = \nr(0). Then, the system acts as a single oscillator with frequency wi = \nmod=. Consider k = 2, without loss of generality, as illustrated \nin Fig. 1. Then, one can couple these new oscillators with a constant \nr(l) = f(r), and obtain a new oscillating system with frequency o2 = \n~,dm < wi. Continuing this process, one eventually obtains the final \nfrequency \nf_0,= Oy_lJ1 -r(y) (8) \nwhere N = 2\u201d, and Y labels the level of organization, or hierarchy. This \nrecurrence relation can be written as a continued fraction that could \nHIERARCHICALLY COUPLED ULTRADIAN OSCILLATORS 523 \n0 o~o\u201dooo ~&j$lgQ \nQ@g& \nO0 \n0 \n0 0 O \n@ \n0 0 \n0 0 \n0 \n0 \n0 O 0 O 0 \nO Oo \nV=4 \n00 0 0 \n0 \nFigure 1.

For the particular case when r = q, \nthe analytical result can be found: \n524 R. A. BARRIO et al. \n0, \n-5. \n-10. \n-15. \n-2o\\ \n-25. \n-3o* \n1 \n\u20180.8 \nFigure 2.

This can be investigated numerically, as is shown in Fig. 2, where oloo \nis plotted in the (q, r) space. Observe the logarithmic vertical scale, which \nshows that one can reduce the frequency four orders of magnitude easily \nwith reasonable values of the parameters. \n4. Numerical Calculations with a Simple Model. Let us now introduce a \nmore realistic model to test the conclusions of the preceding arguments. \nLet us represent a single ultradian oscillator i by a simple system with a \nlimit cycle, the Van den Pol equation \njtj + (X\u201d - V)ij + Wo2Xi =\nwhich could be coupled to k identical oscillators \n(in units of &>, and written as \n0 (11) \nwith elastic connections r \n(12) \nwhere u > 0 is the bifurcation parameter. \nHIERARCHICALLY COUPLED ULTRADIAN OSCILLATORS 525 \nLet us build up a network with connections defined by a self-similar, \nhierarchical rule. The hierarchy is denoted by the index Y. Then, the \nsystem is fractal and it is represented by \nii = Ov-lyib,t) \ngv,t) = -fl&_1 \ni \nXi(V,t> - irijCV't)Xj(vlt) I (13) j#i \nwhere now, in order to mimic the actual Ca2+ oscillators and assuming that \nthe coupling is only taking place if the Ca channels are open at the time \nwhen the wave arrives, we define \nrjj(v,t) =G(zJ- 1) tanh \n[ ( \u2018ijyyl)i] \n(14) \nwhere the bar denotes a time average. A,(v, t) = l&(t) - $(t)l, with \ntan( e,(t)) = yi( v, t)\/xi( v, t), and a the width of the switching. The output at \nlevel v is taken to be \nS(V,t) = $ ,~x,(V,r). \nI-1 \nThe frequency at any level W, is calculated by taking the Fourier \ntransform of the system output s(v, w): \n1 \ndv, w,) = ~1 \nt+At \ne-\u2018\u201cu\u2019s(v,t) dt. \nt \n(15) \nThere are two parameters: r and a. A large portion of the two-dimen- \nsional parameter space was explored using a simple improved Euler method, \nand it was found that the frequency stabilizes at a small value for some \nminimal N, provided r is sufficiently large. In the case of r = 0.91 and \na = 0.34, the final frequency w = 3.85 x 10-40, is attained for N = 8192 \noscillators and remains constant, within O.l%, for many more oscillators. \nThis can simulate the actual biological system with the correct quantities \n(Van den Pol, 1980). \nAll calculations were made for k = 2, but results can also be obtained for \nother values of k. A network of N = 2\u201d oscillators was examined more \ncarefully using a Runge-Kutta method, and adding a random deviation to \nthe frequencies of N lo%, following both a flat and a Gaussian distribu- \n526 R.

The analytical \nresult for the simpler fractal model with q = 0.9 (broken line) also gives the \nsame limiting value for large v, but is less effective in attaining stability. For \ncomparison, the continuous line shows the dramatical square root dependence \npredicted by equation (2). The dash-dot line shows an exponential decay \nobtained with q = 1. \ntion. We verified that the frequency is stabilized for large N. Figure 3 \nillustrates a typical numerical calculation including noise; the values were \nchosen to give constant frequency for N z 212 = 4096 cells, and to obtain a \nreduction factor of N 10V4, in order to represent a real clock. By allowing \nk > 2, the hierarchical couplings could be less strong to obtain the same \nvalues. \n5. Discussion. Here we discuss other possibilities of obtaining a robust \nclock without using a hierarchical network. It was pointed out a long time \nago that some experimental results from the circadian pacemaker seemed \nto be in contradiction with the properties of models using limit-cycle \noscillators (Winfree, 1967). Although it has been proved that these models \ncan satisfactorily explain such experiments (Pavlidis, 1975, 1992), it is \ninteresting to discuss the possibility of an array of pendulum-like oscillators \nsince this system can present a cutoff frequency. \nIt is well known that a chain of pendulums coupled with springs presents \na low cutoff frequency, which is independent of the number of oscillators. \nThe problem with this system is that the low frequency is the Same as for \nthe normal mode of a single pendulum. This system is analogous to a \nhigh-pass electric filter. \nOne could obtain a lower value of the frequency by coupling the \noscillators through a medium with high relative capacity. The possible \nHIERARCHICALLY COUPLED ULTRADL4N OSCILLATORS 527 \nrealization of capacitively-coupled oscillators in biological systems has been \ndiscussed recently (Othmer and Watanabe, 19921, and it has been shown \nthat one can obtain circadian periods from ultradian limit-cycle oscillators \nif this sort of coupling is strong. While the analysis is carried out for linear \ncoupling, there are indications that similar behaviour is obtained for more \ngeneral ways of coupling. At present, it is unclear if this model is more \nconvenient than the one presented here, except that the latter does not \ndepend on the nature of the limit-cycle function or on the way one couples \nthe oscillators. In the analytical discussion, we presented a simple elastic \ncoupling, but in the numerical calculation we used a more complicated \ncoupling function, and the conclusions were unchanged (see Fig. 3). \nIt remains to be seen if the inclusion of non-linear (anharmonic) cou- \npling results in a lower bound to the frequency and stabilization of the \nsystem with respect to the number of components. A general treatment is \nnot possible, but we can gain further insight if we consider any oscillator \nstill obeying equation (5), but with anharmonic coupling terms in A(x). \nThese terms have to have only odd powers of x since we want a bound \nstate. A simplified version would be a sine function, for example. In that \ncase, one obtains \nN \ns\u2019+f(s)i + w,2s - 0i(N- 1)r C sin(x,) = 0 \nk=l \nwhich, for the low-frequency mode (x1 =x2 = *** =xN), can be reduced to \na form similar to equation (6). In the case of a simple pendulum, one \narrives at a sine-Gordon equation, as in an array of Josephson junctions, \nand one expects the possibility of soliton solutions at finite frequency. \nThese non-linear effects are expected to be present in a capacitively \ncoupled network as well. The appearance of a lower limit for the frequency \nof this mode when one constructs a hierarchical array of oscillators with \nthis kind of non-linear coupling still holds, which suggests that this feature \nis model independent, and one could use more sophisticated oscillators to \nbe applied for specific biological modelling. \nWelsh et al. (1995) observed circadian rhythms in the firing rate of \nindividual SCN neurons living in a dissociated culture. They also observed \nthat circadian oscillations from different neurons in the same culture were \nnot synchronized. These observations seemed to be enough to conclude \nthat SCN circadian pacemaker is formed from single cell circadian oscilla- \ntors. However, a careful reading of the recent literature reveals that the \nquestion of the origin of circadian oscillations, either by coupled ultradian \noscillators or by a collection of individual cells with circadian rhythms, is \nnot settled yet. \n528 R. A. BARRIO et al. \nThe acrophase of the circadian oscillations observed by Welsh et al. \n(1995) was related to the regular firing pattern. It is well known that this \npattern is presented at all circadian times (Shibata et al., 1984; Thomson et \nal., 1984; Zhang et al., 1995). This means that if one could monitor the \nsingle-cell firing rate rhythms in SCN slice preparations, or even in vivo, for \nmore than one day, they could be found not synchronized, although the \nclock would function normally. \nFurthermore, Watanabe et al. (1993) measured vasopressin release in the \nsame type of dissociated SCN culture, with neurons resting on a syncitium \nof astrocytes, and mentioned that in more than one hundred cultures a \nclear circadian oscillation of vasopressin was observed (monophasic oscilla- \ntion), with the exception of few cultures in which plating cells were \ndamaged by accident, or their density was very low. This seems to show that \na minimum number of cells is needed for the clock to work properly, and \nsupports the idea that coupled ultradian oscillators do play an important \nrole in circadian clock generation. \nMoreover, there is presently detailed quantitative evidence (Davis and \nGorski, 1984) that the period of circadian rhythms is a function of the total \nvolume of undamaged SCN. This phenomenon can be explained by the \npresent model. \nIn the SCN, Ca2+ currents are involved in the generation of action \npotentials and phase shifts in the circadian rhythms of electrical activity in \nvitro (Meijer and Rietveld, 1989; Aguilar-Roblero et al., 1996). Release of \nCa2+ from intracellular deposits into the cytoplasm has been shown to be \ncritical in the regulation of several neural processes (Aguilar-Roblero et al., \n1996). The intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis has not been studied sufficiently \nin SCN. The present model is based on the intracellular Ca2+ ultradian \noscillation in SCN glial cells (Van den Pol et al., 1992). The result of this \nheirarchical coupling leads to a stabilization of the output frequency of \nCa2+ population oscillation to a circadian value that is robust. Recently, \ncircadian oscillations of intracellular Ca2+ release channels, expressed by \nnumber of Ryanodine receptor, in SCN slice preparation were observed \n~o~;ar-Robl ero et al., 1996). This is consistent with the output of our \nThe hierarchical coupling has to be dynamical, therefore any sigmoidal \nfunction of the type f(x) = tanh(x), assumed in the model, could mimic the \ndynamical state of the gap junction of astrocytes. It is well known that \nastrocytes are extensively coupled by gap junctions composed mainly of \nconnexin43 and can form a large syncitium. The permeability, and conse- \nquently the gap junction mediated communication, is regulated by particu- \nlar conditions (Giaume and McCarthy, 1996; Verkhratsky and Kettenmann, \n1996); although research in this area is still at its early stages, both \ntheoretically and experimentally, and significant progress requires a transi- \ntion from the understanding of basic properties to the study of function. On \nHIERARCHICALLY COUPLED ULTRADIAN OSCILLATORS 529 \nthe other hand, preventing undesirable variations of the parameters of the \n&radian oscillators from modifying the output circadian frequency, addi- \ntional mechanisms would be required. These mechanisms should be ruled \nby the phylogeny and the ontogeny of the circadian function and are \nbeyond the scope of this paper. \nIn all mathematical models of the biological clock, there are parameters \nthat have to be used to make them fit the experiments quantitatively. In the \npresent model, there are two basic parameters that fix the low-frequency \nsolution of the equations. One could ask how, in reality, these parameters \nare determined. This question is, in general, far beyond the scope of \nmathematical models. However, the value of the low-level interaction \nr = r(O) and the factor needed for frequency demultiplication could be \nencoded in the phylogeny and ontogeny of the circadian function. \n6. Conclusions. One can summarize the results of the present study as \nfollows: \n1. This simple model shows that a hierarchical network of simple non- \nlinear oscillators presents scale invariance with respect to the number \nof components. \n2. The stabilization of the frequency is very efficient, and with reason- \nable values of the parameters, one is able to lower the period four \norders of magnitude, as needed for a circadian oscillation. \n3. The model is general and may be easily elaborated to obtain more \nrealistic properties of circadian rhythms, without modifying the scale- \ninvariance property. \n4. The model is stable over a wide range of parameter values, and it is \nnot crucial that these are not precisely defined, a very convenient \nproperty to model biological systems. \nAs we mentioned before, the use of multicomponent oscillator models \nhas been successful in reproducing available experimental data. In any case, \nif one models the circadian rhythm with simple pendulums or limit-cycle \noscillators, there remains the central question of obtaining a low-frequency \noscillation that is stable and robust. As we have shown, the period of a set \nof coupled oscillators is a complicated function of the periods of the \ncomponents, and under certain restrictions, one can still think of a long \nperiod behaviour. We discussed the case in which oscillators (harmonic or \nlimit-cycle) are (elastically or non-linearly) coupled in a network, and we \nfound that the frequency of the output is generally dependent on the \nnumber of oscillators. On the contrary, if one uses a hierarchical coupling, \none can obtain a scale-invariant output frequency for sufficiently strong \ncoupling that is practically model independent. \n530 R. A.
