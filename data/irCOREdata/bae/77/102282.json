Reed, and Vittorio M. N. Passaro, Member, IEEE\nAbstract\u2014The fabrication restrictions that must be imposed\non the geometry of optical waveguides to make them behave as\nsingle-mode devices are well known for relatively large waveguides,\nwith shallow etch depth. However, the restrictions for small wave-\nguides ( 1 m or less in cross section) are not well understood.\nFurthermore, it is usually a requirement that these waveguides are\npolarization independent, which further complicates the issues.\nThis paper reports on the simulations of the conditions for both\nsingle-mode behavior and polarization independence, for small\nand deeply etched silicon-on-insulator (SOI) waveguides. The aim\nis to satisfy both conditions simultaneously. The results show that\nat larger waveguide widths, waveguide etch depth has little effect\non the mode birefringence because the transverse-electric (TE)\nmode (horizontal-polarized mode) is well confined under the rib\nregion. However, at smaller rib widths, the etch depth has a large\ninfluence on birefringence. An approximate equation relating the\nrib-waveguide width and etch depth to obtain polarization-inde-\npendent operation is derived. It is possible to achieve single-mode\noperation at both polarizations while maintaining polarization\nindependence for each of the waveguide heights used in this paper\nbut may be difficult for other dimensions. For example, a 1- m\nSOI rib waveguide with an etch depth of 0.64 m and rib width of\n0.52 m is predicted to exhibit such characteristics.\nIndex Terms\u2014Polarization independence, rib waveguides, sil-\nicon-on-insulator (SOI), single-mode condition (SMC).\nI. INTRODUCTION\nS INCE the early investigation of propagation loss and po-larization dependence of silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wave-\nguides, the interest in SOI photonic devices has increased enor-\nmously. Research activities in SOI range from the study of basic\nbuilding blocks such as waveguides [5]\u2013[9] and bends [14] to\nmore complex devices such as modulators [1], ring resonators\n[2], Bragg gratings [3], and even light sources in silicon [4].\nSingle-mode SOI rib waveguides with a large cross section have\nbeen studied extensively by a number of researchers [5]\u2013[9] to\nManuscript received December 10, 2004; revised March 19, 2005.

The majority of these photonic devices in SOI have been\nstudied in waveguides that are multimicrometers in cross-sec-\ntional dimensions (of the order of 5 m) to facilitate low-loss\ncoupling to and from optical fibers. Soref et al. [5] first proposed\na simple expression for these large ribs waveguides, related to\ntheir geometry to ensure that they satisfied the single-mode con-\ndition (SMC), as follows:\n(1)\nfor (2)\nwhere is the ratio of slab height to overall rib height, is\nthe ratio of waveguide width to overall rib height, and .\nThe analysis of the waveguides was limited to shallow-etched\nribs as stated in (2) , where deeply etched rib\nwaveguides are not considered. Furthermore, the waveguide\ndimensions are larger than the operating wavelength. Their\nanalysis was based on the assumption that high-order vertical\nmodes (i.e., modes other than the fundamental mode) confined\nunder the rib waveguides were coupled to the outer slab region\nduring propagation, therefore yielding high propagation losses\nfor the higher order modes. Thus, the waveguides behave as\nsingle-mode waveguides, as all other modes are lost. The ana-\nlytical effective-index method (EIM) was used by Pogossian et\nal. [6] for a similar analysis and suggested that more stringent\ngeometrical constraints needed to be imposed for single-mode\noperation, resulting in an alternative value of in (1).\nPowell [7] also made a more general analysis for rib waveguides\nwith vertical or angled sidewalls, finding a simple analytical\nexpression for such waveguides that was in good agreement\nwith the original work of Soref et al. [5], as well as using a\nsimple scalar approximation in his analysis. He showed that\nthe scalar approximation is sufficiently accurate for large rib\nwaveguides with shallow etch depth (large ), where the mode\nprofiles are similar for both polarizations.\nThe widely used design criteria stated in (1) was revisited\nrecently [9] using the full-vectorial beam-propagation method\n(BPM) to demonstrate this simple equation is not sufficient to\nensure single-mode behavior. The prediction by the design for-\nmula (1) that waveguides should be single-mode was questioned\nin this analysis when some waveguides were shown to support\nother higher order vertical modes. Nevertheless, this and all the\nother work presented on this specific issue to date has been\nlimited to waveguides of large cross section with shallow etch\ndepths .\n0733-8724\/$20.00 \u00a9 2005 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Cross section and waveguide parameters of an SOI rib waveguide.\nHowever, there is a current trend in silicon photonic circuits to\nmove to smaller device dimensions for improved cost efficiency\nand device performance. The trend can also come at some cost\nto performance, notably in the polarization dependence of the\ncircuits if they are not carefully designed. Furthermore, the va-\nlidity of the design equation (1), applied to small and deeply\netched rib waveguides, has not been sufficiently addressed. The\nobjective of this paper is to discuss the polarization dependence\nand single-mode conditions for smaller waveguide dimensions\nwith deeply etched ribs. The degree of influence of etch depth\non waveguide performance also becomes apparent when small\nwaveguides are designed for polarization independence. The\nissues associated with work on the polarization independence\nand single-mode conditions for smaller waveguide dimensions\nis discussed and examples of designs that satisfy both require-\nments are given. In order to maintain the consistency with other\nwork [5], [7]\u2013[9], the full-vectorial BPM was used to analyze\nthe waveguide structure in Fig. 1 for single-mode propagation\nand polarization independence. Some results of the SMC condi-\ntion have also been verified by the finite-element method (FEM)\n[11].\nII. SINGLE-MODE CONDITION FOR\nSMALL-CROSS-SECTION WAVEGUIDES\nThe modal analysis of the small-cross-section SOI rib\nwaveguides is based on the BPM algorithm [10] using the\ncorrelation mode-solving technique, particularly useful for\n-invariant structures. In the correlation approach, an arbitrary\nfield is launched for each dominant polarization into the wave-\nguide structure off-center, to excite all the possible modes and\nallow propagation in the direction via normal BPM. During\nthe propagation stage, the following correlation function be-\ntween the input field and the propagating field is computed:\n(3)\nThe correlation method resolves all high-order modes sup-\nported in the structure by determining the mode spectrum,\nwhere eigenvalues or the effective-index value of all guided\nmodes and leaky modes are found. The computed mode spec-\ntrum is the fast Fourier transform (FFT) of the correlation\nfunction. It will exhibit a peak at the frequency of each of the\nguided mode, with a height equal to the fraction of power in the\nlaunched field contained in the mode. To maintain consistency\nof the analysis with others, we have employed the notation\n[5], [9] of nm and nm, where ,\n, and where refers to the dominant\nvertical polarization and to horizontal polarization. They\nare commonly known as quasi-TE modes for nm modes\nand quasi-transverse magnetic (quasi-TM) for nm modes.\nThe single-mode simulation was set up using the waveguide\nstructure shown in Fig. 1, which is a rib waveguide of silicon\non silica and has an upper cladding\nthat is air . SOI rib waveguides with an overall height\nof 1.00, 1.35, and 1.50 m are analyzed at a wavelength of\n1.55 m, related to examples of design geometries used in our\nprevious papers, such as silicon optical modulators [1], ring res-\nonators [2], and waveguide-based Bragg gratings [3]. We have\nmade the assumption of no coupling between the quasi-TE and\nquasi-TM modes. The energy fields in both majority and mi-\nnority components are taken into consideration because a mi-\nnority field component has the potential of changing the effec-\ntive-index value for small waveguide cross sections. A Gaussian\nfield was chosen to approximate an optical fiber mode, and it is\ndeliberately launched off-center at one third of the waveguide\nwidth to excite high-order modes supported in the structure.\nThe propagation length was chosen to be 4 mm, which is suf-\nficiently long to allow potentially guided higher order modes\nto leak out from the rib waveguide. A number of vertical and\nhorizontal guided modes is restricted to three ( , ,\nand , ) for both polarizations during the com-\nputation, in order to minimize the computation time. However,\nthis is more than sufficient to determine the single-mode\u2013multi-\nmode transition. In the simulations, the waveguide height ,\netch depth , and slab height were kept constant while in-\ncreasing the waveguide width in increments of 0.01 m to find\nthe boundary between single-mode and multimode behavior.\nThe iteration of the simulation is repeated with different values\nof the slab height to waveguide height ratio (parameter\n). Hence, the process is one in which we gradually in-\ncrease the waveguide width until a second-order mode is guided\n( , ). The boundary of the single mode\/multimode\ncan therefore be determined by computing the minimum wave-\nguide width at which the first higher order mode is supported by\nthe waveguide structure.\nIn Fig. 2, our simulation results are presented together with\na scalar approximation [7] and other approaches of Soref et al.\n[5] and Pogossian et al. [6], for an SOI rib waveguide height\nof 1.50 m and operating wavelength 1550 nm. It should\nbe noted that the original data of [5] and [6] does not extend\nto the range of , and so here we have simply extended\nthese results by extrapolation. Fig. 2 shows that the scalar ap-\nproximation and quasi-TE ( ) results are very similar for a\nlarge range of values of parameter (above ). This\nscalar approximation result also approaches the results of [6]\nfor values of parameter less than approximately 0.40. How-\never, it can be seen that the results of the quasi-TM ( ) that\nsimulation is very different from both the scalar and quasi-TE\ncomputation for , where the boundary of the single\nmode\/multimode regime for and modes diverge.

The trend lines in the plot indicate the boundary between single-mode and multimode regions.\nfor deeply etched rib waveguides is different from commonly\nused design rules [5], [6] and the strict criteria for the cutoff\ncondition, where parameter [6], are less useful than the\nother simulations, either for small or large values of parameter\n. This also reaffirms that the work of Soref et al. [1], or even\nthat of the scalar approximation, can be used as a basis of de-\nsign of single-mode waveguides for shallow-etched rib wave-\nguides with a large cross section. The primary issues,\nhowever, are the differences between the SMCs for different po-\nlarizations at smaller values of parameter , which are signifi-\ncant, particularly in small waveguides. This is because the op-\ntical confinement for such small waveguides is dominated by\nthe boundary conditions, which are well known to be different\nfor quasi-TE and quasi-TM modes.\nOur initial investigation for waveguide height 1.50 m\nwas presented in conventional notation for a rib-waveguide ge-\nometry depicted in Fig. 1. It is instructive, however, to plot\nthe data associated with parameter in a different way, which\nis related to waveguide etch depth . In the remainder of\nthis paper, we adopt this approach as it clarifies some of the\ndesign issues. If we turn our attention to the design of bire-\nfringence-free waveguides, we can also provide guidelines for\nachieving both single-mode behavior and birefringence free be-\nhavior simultaneously.\nIII. POLARIZATION INDEPENDENCE\nThe increased polarization dependence in small waveguides\nis derived from the increasingly differing mode shapes of the\nTE and TM modes. The question arises as to whether the prime\nconcern is to maintain similar losses for the TE and TM modes\nor to provide similar propagation constants in order to maintain\nsimilar phase performance for interferometric-based devices,\nbecause it is not generally possible to maintain both. In prin-\nciple, waveguide birefringence can be removed by appropriate\nchoice of rib-waveguide width-to-height ratio [3], [8] or by\nemploying stress engineering [12] to tailor the thickness of\nSiO for polarization compensation. Similarly, as discussed\npreviously, it is also possible to design a rib waveguide sup-\nporting only a single mode with an appropriate selection of\nthe rib width and height [8], [9]. The degree of influence of\nwaveguide width and etch depth on waveguide birefringence\nfor a given rib height is demonstrated by further simulations\nhere. Once again, we have used rib-waveguide heights of 1.00,\n1.35, and 1.50 m, and have evaluated the effective indexes of\nthe fundamental quasi-TE and quasi-TM modes. If we assume\nan operating wavelength of 1550 nm, we can produce a graph of\nthe variation of the TE\/TM fundamental mode effective-index\ndifference for various etch depths\nand waveguide widths .\nFig. 3(a)\u2013(c) shows various curves of waveguide width\nagainst the effective-index difference, each for a different\nwaveguide height. By using an appropriate etch depth for\neach waveguide height, the curves cross the zero-birefringence\n(ZBR) axis twice when the effective indexes of both polariza-\ntion modes is the same, which indicates it is possible to produce\nbirefringence-free waveguides of two different waveguide\nwidths when a deep etch depth is employed . The\nwider waveguide width is highly preferable compared with its\nnarrower counterpart when we consider that the wider devices\nwill result in more flexibility during fabrication, such as the\naccuracy of the etch depth. If we consider 1.50 m,\n0.90 m, the birefringence-free waveguide widths can\nbe determined from Fig. 3(c) as 0.90 and 1.05 m. If we now\nintroduce etch-depth uncertainties of 10 nm, we see that the\nlatter width is more desirable as the impact of the uncertainty\non change in birefringence is reduced from to\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Effective-index difference calculation between quasi-TE and quasi-TM polarized modes using the FEM [11], for waveguide heights (a) 1.00 \u0016m,\n(b) 1.35 \u0016m, and (c) 1.50 \u0016m.\n. The same trend can also be observed in Fig. 3(a)\nand (b). The study on etch control of silicon in 0.13- m\nprocess technology has determined experimentally [16] that\nthe etch-depth tolerances are of the order of 1 to 2 .\nTherefore, if we consider a 1- m etch depth to form an SOI\nwaveguiding structure, the tolerance will be of the order of\n10 nm. As process technology moves to the next generation\nbeyond the critical dimensions (CDs) of 90 nm, following the\nInternational Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS)\n[17], the reactive ion etching (RIE) process control will be\nimproved and continue to be driven by the CD requirement\nof advanced lithographic processes. However, most optical\ndevices made from silicon are likely to have CDs of hundreds\nof nanometers for the foreseeable future, which means that the\ninfrastructure already exists for the next several generations of\noptical circuits, if they are fabricated in silicon.\nA gradual increase of the etch depth is also used in the simu-\nlations to show the influence of etch depth on the modal bire-\nfringence. The result shows that at larger waveguide widths,\nwaveguide etch depth has little effect on the mode birefringence\nbecause the TE mode (horizontal polarized mode) is well con-\nfined under the rib region. However, at smaller rib widths, the\netch depth has a large influence on birefringence. It is clear that\nin each of the plots in Fig. 3, the curves have gone through\nthree transitions. For large waveguide widths, the TE-mode ef-\nfective-index dominates as most power is confined under the rib\nregion; this makes the device exhibit slablike behavior, allowing\nhigher order modes to couple to the slab region. As the width is\nreduced gradually, the effective index of the TM mode becomes\nsimilar to that of the TE mode, and then the effective-index dif-\nference can become negative. When the waveguide width be-\ncomes very small, most of the mode power will again be con-\nfined under the slab regions, and as a result, the TE effective\nindexes once again become higher than those of the TM modes.\nTo confirm the trends of the data in the simulations, some of\ndata in Fig. 3 have been computed by the full-vectorial FEM\n[11], finding good agreement with results produced by BPM.\nDrawbacks associated with small waveguide geometries are\nthat it is difficult to fabricate such devices accurately, and it\nbecomes difficult to couple light efficiently into the waveguides.\nAlthough computer simulations enable us to generate detailed\ndesigns of rib waveguides with polarization independence, we\nmust take into account variations in the fabrication process\nsuch as etch depth uniformity, etching profile, and CD, as\nwell as process control of waveguide width. Real-time in situ\nmonitoring of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) using\ndeep RIE processing has been demonstrated [18] in high-as-\npect-ratio etching in SOI wafers.

Etch-depth influence on waveguide width in SOI structure to support ZBR for various waveguide heights at \u0015 = 1550 nm, reflecting the etch-depth\ntolerance requirements in relation to process technology.\nhave been studied extensively in [19]. Both approaches are\nnondestructive and provide real-time process analysis. Hence,\nthis will lead to improved process accuracy and controllable\nprocess repeatability.\nIf we now plot the locus of the points in Fig. 3 that cross the\nZBR axis, we observe similar trends for all three rib waveguide\nheights. We have also added simulated ZBR data for waveguide\nheights of 1.20, 1.75, and 2.00 m. This is shown in Fig. 4,\nwhere we plot etch depth against waveguide width for a variety\nof waveguide heights and fit with the second-order polynomial.\nWe note that there is a minimum etch depth for each\nwaveguide design, which must be matched to a specific wave-\nguide width if the polarization-independent condition is to be\nmet. Hence, we can use this data to predict the rib waveguide\nwidth and etch depth needed for polarization-independent oper-\nation by assuming that the relationship between and wave-\nguide height is linear. This relationship can be expressed by the\nfollowing approximate equation after linear regression fitting of\nsimulation data, for waveguide heights 2 m:\n(4)\nThis finding is particularly useful to aid the design of wave-\nguides meeting the requirement of polarization independence.\nThe low curve gradient at the minimum etch depth depicted in\nFig. 4 also makes the minimum etch depth a good choice from a\nfabrication perspective, because the impact of the tolerances of\nthe etching process is minimized. It is also interesting to note\nthat as a proportion of the waveguide height , the\nminimum etch depth increases as the waveguide height is re-\nduced, which in turn means that for smaller waveguide height,\nthe smaller the maximum value of parameter becomes and a\nhigher etching tolerance must be satisfied to maintain the ZBR\ncondition. For instance, an etch depth error of 10 nm will in-\ntroduce a modal birefringence difference of for\nFig. 5.

Unlike other authors, we have presented the data in\nterms of the absolute waveguide dimensions rather than using\nnormalized values of ratio and parameter , because this\nprovides a clearer indication of the design problem. All the data\npoints that cross the ZBR axis in Fig. 3 were used in Fig. 4\nin terms of waveguide width and etch depth to plot\na locus of the birefringence-free condition for varying wave-\nguide dimensions.

It is interesting to note that the intersection between the\nbirefringence-free locus and the quasi-TE graphs determines the\nlimit of the waveguide width to guide not only the fundamental\nTE mode, but multiple TM modes. For instance, the maximum\nvalues of rib width are 0.77, 0.98, and 1.05 m for wave-\nguide heights of 1.00, 1.35, and 1.50 m, respectively, to\nsatisfy the quasi-TE SMC and the birefringence-free condition.\nHowever, if we also wish to satisfy the SMC for TM polariza-\ntion, narrower waveguides are required. In this case the wave-\nguide widths must be 0.52, 0.83, and 0.92 m, respectively. The\ncrossing points for the two polarizations between the birefrin-\ngence-free condition and both single-mode boundary lines are\ncloser to each other as the waveguide height is increased. Hence,\nit is easier to satisfy both conditions for waveguide heights of\n1.35 and 1.50 m compared with waveguides with a height of\n1.00 m or less in the context of fabrication tolerance. As the\netch depth increases (or parameter decreases), the wave-\nguide width must also be reduced to maintain only single-mode\noperation for a designated polarization. This can be observed for\nall the ZBR data points below which the quasi-TM boundary\nline intersects the ZBR locus plots in Fig. 7. These results of\nSMC and ZBR curves give us confidence in the possibility to\nachieve SOI waveguides satisfying both requirements, as re-\nquired in many applications. However, in some cases, the rel-\nevant requirement of the waveguide width may be too narrow\nfor fabrication purposes and impractical when coupling light\ninto the small-waveguide structure. The SMC for these small\nwaveguides with deep etch depth is effectively lim-\nited by the boundary condition set by the quasi-TM mode. We\nhave produced a generalized equation in terms of waveguide di-\nmensions, following the notation used in [5]\nand (6)\nIt is interesting to examine the usefulness of the above approxi-\nmate equation by comparing with experimental SOI waveguide\ndevices. Following the approach given in [6], we have compared\nthe experimental results from Rickman et al. [13] who experi-\nmentally investigated the dependency of waveguide geometries\nsupporting only fundamental-mode operation, to our approxi-\nmate equation, even though the results of [6] are based upon\nwaveguides much larger than those simulated in this paper. We\nhave adopted this approach because there is insufficient experi-\nmental data in the literature to compare and study with our mod-\neling, to unequivocally confirm our design rules. However, our\nsimulation results were in reasonable agreement with the ex-\nperimental observations for waveguide height of 4.3 m, even\nfor large etch depths [13]. We can observe from Fig. 8 that, in\ncontrast to the boundary prediction of both Pogossian et al. [5]\nand Soref et al. [6], (6) in this paper marks a clear separation\nbetween the boundary of single-mode and multimode regions\nover a large range of etch depth and rib width values, giving us\nadditional confidence in the equation.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, the authors have systematically analyzed the\ndesign parameters of rib-waveguide structures to satisfy both\nthe single-mode and polarization-independence conditions for\nsmall-cross-section SOI waveguides. The requirement of bire-\nfringence-free waveguides can be fulfilled by using a deep etch\ndepth when using small-cross-sectional waveguide dimensions;\nit is more restrictive to design waveguide dimensions to achieve\nsingle-mode operation and polarization independence simulta-\nneously. Not surprisingly, the scalar approximation is accurate\nenough to design single-mode waveguides with large cross sec-\ntion for , in agreement with results in [5] and [7]. How-\never, for deeply etched small waveguides, the situation is more\ndifficult. The authors have proposed approximate design rules\nfor small waveguides, but for critical designs, individual design\nsimulations should be used to achieve single-mode and birefrin-\ngence-free operation simultaneously.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors would like to thank W.
