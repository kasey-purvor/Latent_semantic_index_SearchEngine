Planners\nseek to influence patterns of development in order to achieve wider goals in what they\nconsider to be the public interest. In almost all of Western Europe, there exists legal\nauthority for planning control over property development, ranging from outright bans\non development of certain types in certain places, to more-complex systems in which\nthe appearance and site layout of particular developments are negotiated according to\na mixture of formal and informal rules (Williams, 1996). The planning system in the\nUnited Kingdom falls into the latter category, in its lack of rigid zoning systems, wide-\nranging but imprecise policies in development plans, and reliance on long-established\nconcepts such as `amenity' and `convenience' in the control of development (Booth,\n2003; Cullingworth and Nadin, 2002, chapter 5).\nPartly as a result, central government in the United Kingdom plays an important role\nin establishing general guidelines for the control of property development, in order to\nensure consistency between local authorities in their decisions, and to ensure that other\nelements of government policy are carried out. Central government's policies for the\ncontent of development plans and for the control of development are set out, in the United\nKingdom, in `guidance' notes or `statements' of policy. The best known of these\nare the Planning Policy Guidance (PPG) series issued in England by the Department of\nthe Environment and its successor ministries. These are now gradually being replaced\nby Planning Policy Statements (PPS).

An important feature of town-planning practice in Western Europe has been the attempt to\ncontrol commercial-property development in order to conform with planning principles. The growth\nhistory of large stores such as hypermarkets, superstores, and retail warehouses has thus been\ncharacterised by disputes between developers and planners. In this paper we examine the responses\nof large-store developers to UK government planning guidance that retail developments should be of\na nature and scale suited to the physical environment of town centres. This goes against some\nretailers' preferences for large formats which are generally unsuited to town centres. We explain these\ntwo opposed views, devoting particular attention to the retail developers' case. We then use findings\nfrom two interview surveys with selected retailers to explore how far retail developers are prepared to\ngo in compromising their preferred models of store development in line with government policy.\nFinally we discuss potential effects of recent changes in government policy.\nDOI:10.1068\/a38124\n\u00f4 Corresponding author.and Scotland, are supplemented by occasional `ministerial statements' made in Parliament\nor elsewhere, which update or `clarify'the government's policy in particular respects. Even-\ntually these modifications are incorporated into revised policy guidance or statements.\nThe tension between private-sector property interests and the wider `public inter-\nest', as defined in government statements, is exemplified in the relationship between\nparts of the retail industry and the planning system. The search for economies of scale\nand cost savings has led the industry into developing `large-format stores', particularly\nhypermarkets and superstores, which in their pure form, concede little to town plan-\nning concepts such as visual amenity or good neighbourliness. In addition, the\nlocations preferred by retailers tend to lie outside existing town and district centres,\nwhich planners would regard as more suited to retail development. As elsewhere in\nWestern Europe (Davies, 1995; Evers, 2004; Guy, 1998a; Pe \u00a8 ron, 2001), retail planning\nin the United Kingdom has therefore been characterised by disputes between large-store\ndevelopers and local-authority planners, with central government assuming the role of\nadvisor to both sides as to what might form acceptable compromise in terms of physical\nappearance and location (Guy,1994; 1998b; Ruston,1999). However, central government's\nstance as a mediator has altered, from a position in the 1980s which many commentators\nclaimed was broadly pro-developer, to the current position in which some advantages of\nlarge-store formats are still recognised, but these are subordinated to broader planning\nprinciples in the decision calculus (Guy and Bennison, 2002; Wrigley, 1998).\nThis change in governmental attitude to large-format stores can be traced back to\nthe introduction of `sustainable development' as a major planning goal in the early\n1990s (Owens and Cowell, 2001). Concern over the `unsustainable' nature of super-\nstores and retail warehouses, which relied almost entirely on private-car travel by\ncustomers, coupled with concern over the trading impact of these stores upon town\ncentres, led to policies which specified that town centres should be the preferred\nlocation for all types of retail development (Bromley and Thomas, 1993; DoE, 1996;\nEngland, 2000). Since 1996, these policies have been reinforced, with the effect that the\nsuperstore-development industry finds it increasingly difficult to develop according to\ntheir preferred format and location.\nDiscussion of policy guidance or statements amongst planning researchers tends to\nfocus on their changing content, and their implications for development planning (for\nexample, Harris, 2001; Harris and Thomas, 2004; Tewdwr-Jones, 1997). There has\nhowever been little academic research on the private sector's attitudes towards govern-\nment-policy guidance and advice, recalling the statement that ``Research within\nplanning has not produced the necessary research findings for planners to build up a\nbank of expertise on the impacts of different policies or applications of policy _ .\nMajor research studies in planning journals of the impacts of retail change _ are\nmissing from the literature'' (Findlay and Sparks, 2005, page 13). Although it is clear\nfrom many instances in the practitioner literature that developers are aware of govern-\nment policy both broadly and in some detailed respects, it is less clear to what extent\ndevelopers have been willing to tailor their proposals to meet government `advice'.\nIn this paper we develop this theme through an examination of the response of the\nsuperstore industry to increasingly severe government regulation. In order to reinforce\nthe overall policy to focus new retail and leisure development in town centres as\nembodied in PPG6 (DoE, 1996), and its successor PPS6 (ODPM, 2005a), central\ngovernment's advice to retail developers is to be `flexible': developments should be of\na nature and scale which is suited to the physical environment of town centres. Although\nseveral major developers specialise in town-centre schemes, others (including some\nretailers) prefer to develop large-format retail units which are generally unsuited to\ntown centres. Thus there is a conflict between government policy and the preferences of\n946 C Guy, D Bennisonretail developers. In this paper we explain these two opposed views, devoting particular\nattention to the case of retail developers, which has been underreported in the recent\nacademic and practitioner literature. We then examine evidence of recent development\ntrends, with the view of determining the effects of the search for `flexibility'.We explore\nhow far retail developers are prepared to go in compromising their preferred models of\nstore development in line with government policy. Our information is drawn mainly\nfrom interviews with representatives of major UK retailers.\nIn section 2 we explain how UK government policy which encourages `flexibility'\nin retail development has changed in the last few years. In section 3 we examine the\nrequirements of large-store developers, and explain why off-centre locations are\nfavoured. In section 4 we examine the extent to which large-store developers have\nbeen able to compromise with planning policy, through developing smaller stores\nand\/or developing in town-centre locations. In this section we draw upon question-\nnaire and interview material gained from two surveys of selected large-store retailers,\nproperty developers, and property consultants. In section 5 we examine current\ndevelopment trends involving use of smaller formats and\/or central locations, using\nour interview findings as well as material drawn from the practitioner literature, and in\nsection 6 we draw some wider conclusions.\n2 Planning policies for `flexibility' in retail-store development\nIn this section we review government policy, since 1996, for retail planning, especially\nwhere this concerns the activities of large-format-store developers. These stores include\nlarge food stores, usually termed `superstores', and nonfood, usually termed `retail\nwarehouses'. These stores are designed for customers to purchase routine or household\nitems in a functional environment which emphasises low prices and convenience\n(Birkin et al, 2002, chapter 3; Guy, 1994, chapter 7). It is shown that an initial recogni-\ntion of the advantages of large-format stores was overtaken by an insistence that\ndevelopers should adapt their product to fit in with the overriding principle of retail\ndevelopment being focused on town centres. Recently, however, new government advice\nhas confused the issue.\nIn England, the main source of government advice to local authorities and retail\ndevelopers, at the time of our interviews, was PPG6. This was first introduced as\nnational planning guidance in 1988, and was most recently revised in 1996 (DoE,\n1996). Scotland and Wales operate their own planning guidance, which is similar to\nEnglish policy (Scottish Office, 1998; Welsh Office, 2002).\nPPG6 was intended to ``sustain and enhance the vitality and viability of town\ncentres'' (DoE, 1996, paragraph 1.1), through a combination of encouraging growth\nand improvement in town and district centres, and restrictions on retail development\noutside town centres (see table 1, over). It introduced the `sequential approach', which\naimed to minimise out-of-centre development and enhance the vitality and viability of\ntown centres, by directing retail and leisure developments into town and district\ncentres, provided that sites for such development were `suitable' and `available'. This\npolicy applied both to local authorities, when selecting sites for new retail or leisure\ndevelopment in their development plans, and to private-sector developers and retailers\nseeking planning consent for new development.\nIn PPG6, policy for development of large new stores was unclear. On the one hand,\nthe need for off-centre sites for certain types of retailing was acknowledged. On the\nother hand, developers were advised to tailor their proposals so that they could be\nbuilt in a town centre or edge-of-centre location. This led to confusion amongst\nboth planners and retail developers over interpretation of the sequential approach\n(CB Hillier Parker and Cardiff University, 2004, chapter 2).\nPlanning guidance and large-store development in the United Kingdom 947Table 1.

A study of\nthe ways in which the sequential approach was being applied at planning inquiries\nattempted to clarify the question. It suggested two possible approaches (CB Hillier\nParker, 2000):\n1. The `format-driven approach': the developer has a preferred format, which, in their\nview, does not fit into town centres and for which an off-centre location is therefore\njustified;\n2. The `class-of-goods approach': the view that as such goods can be sold from town\ncentres, even if from several shops rather than one, an off-centre development is not\njustified.\nThe `class of goods'approach found favour in 2000 (DETR, 2001), and a Ministerial\nStatement to the House of Commons in April 2003 reinforced the `class of goods' policy\n(see table 1).\nIn December 2003 a consultation draft version of the new PPS6 was released\n(ODPM, 2003). In this document, although the advice to developers to be `flexible'\nwas reiterated, the advantages to shoppers and the wider economy of large-format\nstores were also recognised. The `class of goods' interpretation of the sequential\napproach was to some extent abandoned (see table 1). These changes reflected pressure\nfrom other government departments, particularly the Treasury, which was concerned\nthat UK retailing was not sufficiently productive compared with other Western economies\n(Guy, 2006).\nThe definitive version of PPS6 was finally published in March 2005 (ODPM,\n2005a). The wording of advice on `flexibility' is similar to that in the statement of\nApril 2003. However, in line with the decision not to maintain the class-of-goods\napproach, it was acknowledged that in some cases a retailer's offer could not be\nrealistically `disaggregated' amongst smaller stores. The guidance indicated that devel-\nopers must justify their choice of off-centre sites by producing ``clear evidence'' that any\nmore-central sites are ``not practical alternatives in terms of availability, _, suitability,\n_ and viability ...'' (ODPM, 2005a, paragraph 3.19).\nThe advice to local authorities in the draft version that large-format stores should\nbe accommodated at the edge of town centres disappeared in the final version of PPS6,\nto be replaced by a weaker statement that local authorities should acknowledge any\n`genuine difficulties' which the retailer may have in carrying out disaggregation. The\nadvice as a whole on `flexibility' and `disaggregation' in PPS6 seems to try to accom-\nmodate both the position in the 2003 ministerial statement and a degree of concession\nto developers, with the result that it has been criticised as `disgraceful'and `appalling' in\nits lack of clarity (Holliss, 2005). We may expect further `clarification' in due course.\nAn additional concern has been the `loophole' in planning law, whereby additional\nsales space can be created within the shell of a building without any need for planning\napproval, for example by developing a `mezzanine' in the roof space, unless this is\nforbidden through conditions imposed on the original planning consent. Following\npressure from planning and political interests (for example, Friends of the Earth,\n2003), secondary legislation was to be enacted in 2005, to require that mezzanine\ndevelopment should be made subject to planning permission (ODPM, 2005b; Warren,\n2005).\nHowever, given the slight relaxation in overall policy in the recent guidance, we can\ndefine a period of very tight control as being approximately 2000^04. In the following\nthree sections we examine the response of retail developers to government policy\nduring this period, and in the final section we consider ways in which developers\nmay respond to current policy.\n950 C Guy, D Bennison3 The case for large-store developers\nThe case for large stores lies partly in economies of scale to the retailer, and partly in\nadvantages for the consumer, including increased product range, better choice of\nbrands, and a more spacious shopping environment (Guy et al, 2005).These advantages\nlead to higher spending per trip and thus enhance the retailers' desire for large-store\ndevelopment.\nLarge stores do not have to be developed out of centre, but in practice sites which\nare large enough for a store and its car-parking requirements are often difficult to\nobtain within town or district centres. In addition, off-centre sites which are well\nconnected to major highways are seen as more accessible for both goods deliveries\nand customer trips.\nNot surprisingly, large-store developers, particularly some retailers, have opposed\nthe increasingly strict policies on off-centre development (for example, Lowe and\nReeves, 2000). This could be interpreted simply as a defensive measure from companies\nanxious to maintain their competitive advantage. However, the companies concerned\nhave tried to develop arguments to show that prohibitions on large-store development\ncan have wider economic consequences.\nFirst, it is claimed that current policy is inconsistent with one of the four objectives\nof government policy generally\u00f6that of maintaining ``an efficient, competitive and\ninnovative retail sector'' (DoE, 1996, paragraph 1.1). For example, the home-improve-\nment retailer B&Q stated in evidence to a House of Commons Select Committee (2003):\n``Larger out-of-centre DIY stores can be built and operated at a significantly lower\ncost per square metre and have higher labour productivity. Within a competitive\nmarket, these lower costs will largely be passed on to consumers in the form of\nlower prices and improved services. Lower prices and improved productivity gen-\nerate more rapid growth in consumer demand, increased employment locally and\nfaster economic growth for suppliers and for the country as a whole. This in turn\nstimulates further demand for home improvement products and a consequent\nrequirement for more retail floorspace in all areas, including those of high unem-\nployment. Conversely, if the current planning restrictions on retail warehousing\nremain in place, and long planning delays continue, the market will expand more\nslowly and current UK DIY retailers will be faced with the option of buying up\ncompetitors' stores, thus further reducing competition and innovation, or investing\noverseas (as the expansion of operations into town centres is almost always not a\nviable proposition)'' [House of Commons, 2003: Memorandum by B&Q (PCP08)].\nSecond, it is claimed that building large stores increases the range of goods\navailable at one location and thus reduces consumer travel by cutting out multidestina-\ntion trips. This argument applies both in the case of the `category killer' large store\nwhich aims to sell everything within its product range, and the retail park which offers\na wide range of shopping opportunities on one site. Research commissioned by B&Q\nshows that use of their largest-format stores (`B&Q Warehouse') compared with smaller\nformats can reduce overall car travel (CB Hillier Parker, 2002).\nThird, it is claimed that consumers benefit from the larger selection of goods, lower\nprices, and other advantages of large stores (Guy et al, 2005). Another study commis-\nsioned by B&Q made a hypothetical comparison between a typical large-format\n`warehouse' store and the equivalent sales area using fourteen separate sites in Reading\ntown centre. The study concluded that:\n``... the physical, economic and transport implications of attempting to sell the range\nand volume of goods sold from a single B&Q `Warehouse' from a number of\nsmaller town centre units is likely to be impractical and, would theoretically result\nin an increase in prices of circa 30%'' (CBRE, 2003, abstract).\nPlanning guidance and large-store development in the United Kingdom 951These arguments were neatly summarised by Marks and Spencer plc in evidence to\nthe House of Commons Select Committee:\n``Ultimately most goods can, in theory at least, be sold in town centres and from\nunit shops in town centres. A DIY store's offer could be broken down into its\ncomponent parts, a supermarket's offer can be split between specialist shops etc.\nHowever, this takes no account of the development of styles and formats of retailing\nthat have proved enormously popular with shoppers, are efficient for retailers and\nprovide sustainability benefits by increasing the range and choice within a single\nunit, thereby limiting the need for multiple trips'' [House of Commons, 2003:\nMemorandum by Marks and Spencer plc (PCP03)].\nThus, the retailers are developing a case which questions the assumptions behind\ngovernment policy. This case has been made to MPs and government ministers and\ncivil servants on many occasions (Pal et al, 2001). The arguments have on most of these\noccasions generated little response from government circles, other than reiteration of\nthe need for `flexibility' in development. However, the minor relaxation of policy in\nPPS6 reflected the influence of these arguments, mediated through Treasury officials\nduring interdepartmental discussions during 2003 (see Guy, 2006).\n4 Retail developers' views on `flexibility'\n4.1 Introduction\nIn this section we consider the extent to which retail developers have been prepared to\nadapt their proposals to meet government policy. As explained above, the need\nto demonstrate `flexibility' first arose in the mid-1990s, but was intensified in 2000 by\nthe government's decision to adopt the `class of goods' interpretation of the sequential\napproach.This meant that the standard product of large single-level stores surrounded by\ncar parking was likely to meet an unfavourable response from local planning authorities.\nThe discussion below is based upon surveys of major off-centre retailers in the\nUnited Kingdom, carried out in 2001 and 2004. The 2001 survey was carried out for\nthe interest group British Council for Out of Town Retail (since renamed Accessible\nRetail). This is a pressure group of chartered surveyors and property professionals who\nare involved in superstore development in the United Kingdom. The 2001 survey was\ndesigned principally to ascertain the nature and extent of economies of scale in this\ntype of retailing (for further details see Guy et al, 2005). However, we were also asked\nto investigate whether retail planning policies were seriously restricting the develop-\nment of superstore formats, both freestanding and in retail parks; and the extent to\nwhich retailers and developers had been able to compromise with planning policies.\nAt that time, the government's intensification of support for town centres had been\nannounced only recently and retailers had not had time to adjust their development\npriorities. This survey was carried out through interviews and questionnaires, and\nwe obtained responses from seventeen major retailers, all of which trade from large\noff-centre formats.\nIn the 2004 survey, carried out through telephone interview and e-mail, we revisited\nmost of these retailers to establish to what extent they had attempted recently a more\nflexible pattern of store development, in response to government policy which by now\nwas well understood. We also interviewed four property consultants with considerable\nexperience of working with large-format retailers and property developers in attempts\nto secure planning consents.\nThe findings reported in this paper are almost entirely qualitative in nature. Our\ninformants were willing to discuss the flexibility issue in general terms and to provide\nspecific examples where their own stores had been affected by this issue. However,\nthey were not able to give quantitative indications of added costs or reduced sales\n952 C Guy, D Bennisonconsequent upon the need to be flexible. This reflects a general difficulty in obtaining\nany quantitative information beyond what is available from company annual reports\nand the like. Reasons for this lie in reluctance to divulge such information, but also\n(apparently) a genuine lack of internal analysis of detailed costs and revenues related to\ndifferent store types and locations. Or, as one of our property consultant respondents\nsuggested:\n``Maybe this is because there aren't actually any worked examples for them to refer\nto and they may not have bothered modelling a store which does not actually fit\ntheir requirement. Why should they?''\n4.2 Findings from 2001 survey\nThe questionnaire was sent to individually named contacts, responsible for property\ndevelopment and\/or planning negotiations, within retail operators which were known\nto have an edge-of-town or out-of-town component in their portfolios. Of the seventeen\nrespondents to the questionnaire, two represented food retailers, two electrical goods,\ntwo do-it-yourself (DIY) goods, seven household goods and furniture, and four were\nfrom other types of retail.\nWith only one exception, all of the retailers in the survey reported that current\ntown planning policy hindered their company's ability to develop their ideal portfolio\nof stores. Four main problem areas became apparent to us from previous discussions\nwith our survey sponsors, and we used these to structure the retailers' comments. The\nfirst two relate directly to the flexibility issue and some willingness to compromise\nin there areas is shown by retailers and planners. The last two problem areas show\nmore-general signs of frustration with what retailers saw as unhelpful or even hostile\nattitudes amongst town planners.\n(a) Downsizing of proposed new stores to allow development on physically restricted sites\nFour of the respondents regarded this as an issue for their companies, although there\nwas some reluctance to compromise their offers to do this. One retailer mentioned an\nexample in London where they had not been allowed to build the store of the size they\nwanted, had gone ahead with a smaller store, but almost immediately after it opened\nput in an application for an extension. One specialised operator reported that their\nproblem was getting units that were small enough, especially on retail parks, whereas\nanother drew some consolation from the fact that smaller sites were easier to assemble\nand did not attract so much resistance from planners\u00f6but nevertheless it was only at\nthe stage of trialling a smaller format in response to this situation, and was not in a\nposition to evaluate its success.\n(b) Development in less-than-ideal locations\nFive of the companies indicated that this had happened, but for most to only a limited\ndegree as it was generally felt not possible to compromise to any major extent given the\ninherent importance of having the correct location: one mentioned that this ``often\nresults in poorly performing stores''.\nHowever, there may be some relationship to the stage of growth a particular\ncompany has reached: most of the companies reporting were well established, but\nthere was one which was in its early stages of growth, and where more compromises\nwere having to be made. The particular example cited was a development in a poor\narea of a large city in need of regeneration:\n``it's a less than ideal location for us at the moment _ a dreadful part of [large city],\nhighly in need of major regeneration, there is an existing retail park there which\nhad two hundred thousand square feet, we took a hundred thousand square foot\nbehind, immediate surrounds of the area are desperately poor _ . Shrinkage is\nPlanning guidance and large-store development in the United Kingdom 953high but consequently because of that and the reputation of the immediate area\nyour destination customer is almost sceptical about travelling into that store and\nleaving their car outside, and we went there because there was an existing planning\nconsent _ I do believe that _ it's going to be a long slow haul.''\n(c) Delay and inconsistency\nThe time delays resulting from the planning process were again mentioned by some\nrespondents under this heading: even if they were not undertaking the main develop-\nment themselves, issues such as putting in a mezzanine floor into a retail park unit\nwere not always straightforward. Extensions to existing stores was also an issue for at\nleast one retailer, but mentioned primarily in the wider context of the problems\nof restricted consents, which were sometimes seen to be unnecessarily detailed in\ntheir specifications, and lacking any underlying appreciation of either modern retail\noperations or shopping behaviours.\n``Running a planning inquiry is over \u00bb200000 these days.We've actually got the site,\nwe've got the misfortune of holding on to the site, paying interest charges while\nyou're running the planning inquiry, that could treble, quadruple the cost.''\nProcedural difficulties associated with plans for refurbishment, expansion, or\nchanges in merchandise were another issue for nine of the retailers. The grocery,\nDIY, and electrical retailers were the ones most affected by these, and they related\nmainly to the issue of restricted consents, and definitions of categories of good used.\nA numberof respondents expressed very considerable frustration withwhat they saw as the\nlack of consistency and arbitrary nature of many decisions on consents. As one put it:\n``it always comes back to planning and dealing with local authorities because they\njust don't have an understanding of commercial reality and the need that if you're\ngoing to make a decision then you've got to get on with it and sort it now and not\nby next Christmas, when the customer has already moved on .... You miss the\ntrend because you just can't move fast enough .... It's a major barrier to being able\nto satisfy the customer which is after all what we're all here to do.''\n(d) The inability to open new stores in particular towns because of planning refusals\nAlmost all of the retailers had experienced this consequence, and most provided\nexamples of where it had occurred. As one noted, it is a ``common problem'', and\nthat ``many outstanding requirements are due to this'', and three others noted that\nthere is a detrimental impact on their company's growth targets. In at least one case\nof a rapidly growing company, it was felt that the policy was proving ``a major drag on\nthe ability of the company to invest'', and that its ideal portfolio of at least another 100\nstores to be built in areas where it is currently not well represented was being compro-\nmised. There was a considerable degree of frustration expressed by respondents at what\nthey often perceived to be arbitrary and inconsistent decisions:\n``There was a store in [town in South West England] which is an existing [Company\nX] store, which is cash and carry, it's right adjacent to a retail park and down the\nroad from a major supermarket so it's a recognised retail location for the town _\n[but] no way would they grant consent, absolutely no way, even though the building\nwas there, hardly any building work needed, car parking there, established, as I\nsaid everything was established and they turned it down, that made no sense,\nrhyme or reason!''\nIn summary, we found that most of the retailers interviewed were finding increasing\ndifficulties in developing large stores, mainly through the effects of government policy.\nThese difficulties were at times exacerbated by what they saw as a rigid stance against\nout-of-centre development, imposed by local authorities.We found little evidence that at\nthis time retail developers were attempting to be flexible in response to policy.\n954 C Guy, D Bennison4.3 Findings from the 2004 survey\nOur second survey was focused mainly on the issue of flexibility and comprised\ninterviews (face-to-face and telephone) with senior staff employed by eleven leading\nretailers who trade from large-scale formats, and four property consultants with wide\nexperience of the issues concerned. The retailers included food (3), DIY (2), and\nother out-of-centre nonfood operators (6). Five of these retailers also have a sub-\nstantial presence in town and district centres. We based our discussions around the\nfollowing questions:\n1. What is your opinion on current government policy for retail development, and how\nthis has changed since 2000?\n2. Are you satisfied with the ways in which government policy is interpreted by local\nplanning authorities?\n3. The government seeks flexibility in store development (for example, smaller stores,\nmultilevel, fewer car parking spaces, showrooms with delivery options, mixed uses).\nIs this practical for your company? Can you give examples of actual schemes you have\nbuilt or intend to build?\n4. Do\/would such schemes impose extra costs on the company? In what ways?\n5. Are such schemes acceptable to your customers? If not why not?\n(a) Opinions on current government policy\nAll respondents were aware of the government's modifications of policy from about\n2000 onwards, and the class-of-goods approach which required applicants to `disag-\ngregate' their proposed store offer. Several respondents interpreted this as a tightening\nup of policy, to the disadvantage of large-format retailers (see table 2 for typical\ninterview statements). However, one respondent (a food retailer) considered that recent\nchanges were ``in the sense of clarification rather than any material differences''. This\nconcurs with the official ODPM view.\nThere was a difference of opinion as to whether the implementation of policy,\nmainly through planning-inquiry decisions, was now more consistent than in the\npast. One retailer commented that ``I think over the last three years [policy] has\nbecome a bit more consistent in its application.'' However, other respondents com-\nplained about inconsistencies in implementation, mainly between local authorities but\nalso to some extent between planning inspectors and the ODPM (see table 2).\nThe partial relaxation of requirements in the draft PPS6 was given a cautious\nwelcome, as it was seen to be a recognition of the requirements of large-format\nretailers, although there was concern whether this would become official policy.\n(b) Interpretation by local authorities\nRespondents were, as in the 2001 survey, highly critical of the ways in which local\nauthorities interpreted government policy. Some authorities used the guidance to argue\nfor a complete ban on retail development outside existing centres. However, one\nrespondent noted differences between `southern' and `northern' local authorities in\ntheir attitudes to large-store development: ``I think in the north the lure of jobs _\nhas made [policy] less relevant, whereas in the south there seems to be a stronger will\nto protect town centres.''\nRespondents were critical of a lack of consistency between local authorities, and\nseveral felt that expertise amongst local authority planners was not sufficiently high to\nbe able to deliver recommendations which recognised the retailer's case (see table 2).\nHowever, our impression from these interviews was that relationships between\nretailers and local authorities were less confrontational than in 2001. There seemed to\nbe more willingness to negotiate and compromise, partly because central government\nPlanning guidance and large-store development in the United Kingdom 955policy was clearer, partly because negotiation was preferable to the costs and delays\ninvolved in appeal.\nThe problems noted in 2001, of costs arising from planning delays and the need to\nappeal against planning refusals, were still very much present for most of the companies\ninterviewed. Indeed, most respondents considered the time taken to process applica-\ntions had increased. This was a result partly of slow processing by local authorities and\npartly of increasing delays within the appeal system (see table 2).\nIt was also noted that the requirements of the sequential approach\u00f6particularly\nthe consideration of `suitable' and `available' sites in town and district centres\u00f6was\nadding to the time spent in preparing planning applications.\n(c) Implementation of flexibility\nRespondents were aware of the need to be more flexible in designing new stores, and\nhad made some adjustments to store formats in order to achieve this. These adjust-\nments followed government advice and included smaller formats, town-centre stores,\nuse of more than one level for sales, and development of mixed-use multilevel schemes.\nHowever, no company was happy with the notion of reducing car-parking standards.\nUse of the Internet and deliveries to the home was for some companies an important part\nof their operation, but not because of pressure from government. These observations\nare spelt out in more detail, including extracts from the interviews, in table 3.\nThere was a general feeling that these adjustments were the result of changes in\nplanning policy and the consequent negotiation with planning authorities. Respondents\nhowever claimed that some of these changes would have taken place in any case,\nas they sought to widen their offer in the face of social changes and new arenas of\ncompetition.\n(d) Imposition of costs\nIt was commonly claimed that greater costs were incurred by retailers as a result of the\ncompromises made in the interests of flexibility. One well-known example quoted by\nseveral respondents was the B&Q store in Sutton town centre, which is on two levels.\nThis was thought to have been very expensive to develop, compared with that company's\nnormal single-level `warehouse' offer.\nTown-centre developments were criticised as incurring greater capital costs,\nbecause of more-expensive sites, delays through site assembly, and higher development\ncosts for more than one level or for a mixed-use scheme (see table 3).\nTown-centre retailing could also incur higher running costs, through restrictions on\ndeliveries in town centres, for example the times of day when deliveries are allowed,\nand the maximum size of delivery vehicles. A further problem arose when car parking\nfor the store was shared with other town-centre users: this created requirements for\ncar-parking provision possibly greater than the store itself needed, and also for systems\nfor charging car-park users, refunding store users, and penalising those who exceeded\ntheir stay on the car park. These problems would not have arisen in out-of-centre\nstores.\nOne retailer also complained that their town-centre stores were trading less\nsuccessfully than similar out-of-centre stores, probably because of consumer resistance\nto paying for car parking, and problems of traffic congestion in the town centre (see\ntable 3).\nMultilevel developments elicited a mixed reaction. On the one hand, retailers are\nseeking to develop mezzanine areas in existing stores, where there is sufficient roof\nheight, and where their offer suits this layout. This may be done in order to sell a larger\nvariety of goods without incurring higher rent, but also to separate staff accommo-\ndation from the sales area. On the other hand, purpose-built multilevel stores are\n956 C Guy, D BennisonTable 2.

There seemed to be some improvement in relations with local planning\nauthorities although delays were still a major cost factor. Apart from food and DIY\nretailers, all the others were less willing to get involved in planning inquiries because of\ncosts, delays, and the need for many site assessments in order to meet the sequential\ntest. Some of the retailers were prepared to develop smaller and multilevel stores if\nnecessary for entry to a particular geographical market. These could be more expensive\nto develop, and were seen as less efficient to operate, either because of reduced\nnumbers of lines, or because of loss of sales space. Car-parking provision in town\ncentres also presented some problems.\n5 Development outcomes\nIn this section we build upon the conclusions from our surveys, through a discussion\nof recent trends in retail development. The source material is taken from practice\nliterature and company statements.\nThe first question is whether retail developers have significantly adapted to new\nrestrictions, or whether they have simply cut back on development. The report on the\n`effectiveness' of PPG6 (CB Hillier Parker and Cardiff University, 2004) showed there\nhad been a downturn in superstore and retail-park development, but not in free-\nstanding retail warehouses such as B&Q stores. These trends would largely predate\nthe imposition of the `class of goods' rule in 2000. More recently, the takeover of\nSafeway stores by Morrisons was clearly related to the inability of Morrisons to expand\ntheir store portfolio into areas where planning consent for large stores was difficult to\nobtain.\nTwo of the major food retailers, Tesco and Sainsbury, have gone on record as\nbroadly accepting the government's emphasis on town-centre development, and have\nfor several years developed smaller edge-of-centre supermarkets, which often anchor\nother retail development. The few stores such as Tesco Metro developed in the heart of\ntown centres serve a different market (mainly town-centre shoppers and workers)\nand would arguably have occurred anyway. Asda have been less willing to reduce the\nsize of their food stores, but have in some cases built very large stores as the focus of\nedge-of-town centre developments, as for example in Llanelli (Thomas and Bromley,\n2003).\nGovernment advice indicates four ways in which retail developers are expected to\nshow flexibility in store development. These are the scale of development; use of\nmultistorey instead of single-storey buildings; incorporation of a mixture of land uses\ninto the scheme; and reducing the scale of car parking provision (ODPM, 2005b, para-\ngraph 3.16). Analysis of both our survey responses and the recent practice literature\nsuggests the following.\n(a) Scale and location of development\nThere has been increasing development of smaller food stores within or on the edge of\ntown centres, but this has been driven by retailers'diversification strategies rather than\nbeing a response to the call for flexibility (Wrigley, 1998). Until very recently there has\nbeen little evidence of smaller nonfood stores being considered, other than Asda\nopening the `George' clothing-only stores in town centres, of which nine are open or\nin the development pipeline at the time of writing.\nThe policy changes in the draft version of PPS6 indicated greater opportunities for\nlarge-format retailers to develop at the edges of town centres, but our interviews\n960 C Guy, D Bennisonsuggest that this type of location may not be optimal, particularly if restrictions on car\nparking are implemented by local authorities.\n(b) Use of multistorey buildings\nThe B&Q store at Sutton is often quoted as a desirable example, but there is evidence\nthat development costs were high. Retailers in our survey claim that both capital and\nrunning costs of multilevel stores are somewhat higher than is the case for single level.\n(c) Mixed-use developments\nThese are becoming more common, particularly among food retailers and in London,\nwhere planning policy now requires provision of residential space as part of super-\nmarket schemes (GLA, 2004a). Our interviews suggest that retailers are sceptical about\nthe commercial success of such developments, althoughTesco are planning several such\ndevelopments (Property Week 2005).\nOne retailer, Ikea, have radically altered their store format and location in order to\ncompromise with planning policy. They have been reported as stating: ``We really need\nto operate more stores in this country. It's not about winning or losing, but realising\nthe planning regime as it is. There is little understanding or support for furniture\nretailers like Ikea in the UK'' (Wood, 2005).\nHaving failed to win consent for several large out-of-centre stores, the company\nhave announced proposals for multilevel, smaller footprint stores contained within\nmixed-use developments in or close to town centres (Chesters, 2005).\n(d) Reduced car parking\nWe found no evidence that retailers are prepared to reduce their car-parking require-\nments, expect possibly with regard to town-centre schemes. The reduced requirements\nfavoured by the Greater London Authority (GLA, 2004b, annex 4) create some con-\ncern, but it is recognised that London residents are more likely to use public transport\nthan is the case elsewhere. However, local authority conditions that car parking in\ntown centres should be made available to nonstore users limit the reduction that can be\nmade.\n(e) Use of Internet and delivery services\nClearly this would have happened irrespective of planning policy. The food retailers\ninterviewed thought that there was much greater use of internet ordering in London,\nprobably because of traffic congestion. However there is little evidence of retailers yet\nestablishing small `showroom' premises in town centres, as government policy suggests.\nThese findings together suggest some willingness amongst large-format retail devel-\nopers to compromise with government objectives. Although retailers like to claim that\ntheir development programmes are consistent with government policy, our interviews,\nas well as evidence of behind-the-scenes lobbying of government departments (Guy,\n2006), suggest that they find the `town centres first' policy a considerable constraint on\nstore development.\nThere is clear evidence from our interviews that in partially accepting government\nrequirements on flexibility, retailers are carrying out suboptimal types of development,\nand\/or incurring additional costs. It is clear also that means of continuing to develop\northodox large-format stores are still being found, particularly on previously developed\n`brownfield' sites, making use of the government's agendas for `regeneration'and `social\ninclusion' (Guy, 2002; Wrigley et al, 2002).\n6 Conclusions\nIn this paper we have examined the response of one set of private-sector interests to\ngovernment policy for controlling new property developments, as expressed in plan-\nning policy guidelines and their successor statements. The largely qualitative research\nmethods employed have proved successful in summarising industry attitudes and\nPlanning guidance and large-store development in the United Kingdom 961responses to policy initiatives, but less effective in identifying financial costs and\nbenefits. This reflects not only the unwillingness of the retail industry to divulge\ndetailed financial material, but also the lack of rigorous appraisal of alternative\ndevelopment paths within the industry itself.\nFour main conclusions emerge from our two sets of interviews and from the\nplanning and property practitioner literature:\n1. The major large-format retailers are well aware of the content of retail planning\npolicy and ways in which it has been changing in recent years. Some of them are\nprepared to expend substantial time and energy in lobbying government interests,\nindividually or through interest groups.\n2. They feel frustrated by a lack of understanding when their proposals are considered\nby local planning authorities, and by the cost of delays for which both local and\nnational governments are seen as responsible. This view is largely directed at the\nways in which policies are implemented, rather than the policies themselves. One might\nadd that the retailers generally make little effort to understand typical local authority\nattitudes.\n3. Since about 2000 there has, however, been a partial acceptance of the government's\nrequirement that developers of large-format stores show flexibility and tailor their\nproduct to the town centre or edge-of-centre environment. This process is still in\nprogress, with recent announcements of scaled-down stores and mixed-use developments.\n4. It is also clear that the search for flexibility is leading to increased costs in both store\ndevelopment and store operation. The recent relaxation of some elements of govern-\nment policy is welcomed but does not amount to a return of what the retailers see as\nthe much more liberal situation of the early 1990s.\nThe recent partial abandonment, in PPS6, of the `class of goods' criterion in the\nsequential approach will be welcomed by large-store developers, as will the advice to\nlocal authorities to show greater understanding of the requirements of the retail\nindustry. In practice though, local authorities and central government are likely to\ncontinue to insist that developers make every effort to use town-centre sites, tailoring\ntheir product to match, despite the extra costs involved. Disagreements between the\ntwo sides are likely to be exacerbated by the unclear advice on `disaggregation'\nincluded in PPS6 (Holliss, 2005). A likely outcome in the longer term is that the\ndevelopment of watered-down versions of large-format stores in town centres will\nmeet increasing opposition, on grounds of incompatibility with the traditional town-\ncentre environment, generation of excessive amounts of car traffic, and concern in\nsome quarters over the further growth of multiple retailing in town centres (for example,\nCPRE, 2004; New Economics Foundation, 2004).\nFurther research will be needed to investigate the responses of the retail industry to\nthe new PPS6 and other policy changes; particularly from retail property developers, as\nopposed to retailers who develop their own premises, with which this paper has been\nmainly concerned. In the wider context, research into the attitudes of other sectors of\nthe development industry towards government policy, particularly some of the more-\ndetailed and more-complex aspects of policy, would help inform future revisions. We\nsuggest that the qualitative methods used in this paper are appropriate for this purpose.\nWe finish with a broader conclusion. The recent history of retail development in the\nUnited Kingdom has been characterised by a lack of `meeting of minds'. Despite\nthe attempts of retail interests to participate in policy formulation (Pal et al, 2001),\nthere is little evidence that planning policymakers in central and local government are\nconcerned with questions of retail efficiency and competition (Findlay and Sparks,\n2004; Guy, 2006; Guy and Bennison, 2002). The retail interests we interviewed feel\nthat the UK government's `town centres first' policy is creating a trend towards\n962 C Guy, D Bennisoninappropriate and inefficient development of `scaled down' large stores in congested\ncentral locations, and reduced opportunities for innovation and competition in multiple\nretailing. Most town planners and politicians would consider that this (if it is really the\ncase) may be a fit price to pay for protection of our town centres, but the debate\ncontinues to be based around anecdote and assertion (on both sides) rather than on\nsolid evidence.\nAcknowledgement.
