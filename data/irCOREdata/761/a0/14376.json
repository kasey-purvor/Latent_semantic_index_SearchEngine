Principles of good course design,\npreparation and use are exemplified in the approach taken towards flexible learning packages\nat Anglia Polytechnic University.\nIntroduction\nLearning technology is not chiefly concerned with using computers, video recorders, audio\ntapes or any other form of technology. Rather, it is concerned with a systematic approach to\nthe planning and delivery of the educational experience. In other words, it should be more\nconcerned with the design of the whole learning experience than with any particular delivery\nmedium. From good design it should become clear how best to deliver a quality learning\nexperience. This paper will therefore not be about the technology but more about the process\nand the initiatives that we in higher education are launching to share that planning and\ndelivery process.\nBut since the principles of learning technology have been around for many years, why\nsuddenly bring it back to the front burner and ask that colleagues reassess its place in strate-\ngies for teaching and learning? Simply because it offers us a flexible model that will aid us\nnot only in coping with the increase in student numbers but will also improve the learning\nexperience of students. The pressures that have led us to look at new (or not so new) ways of\ndesigning the learning experience can, at one level, be said to stem from the major growth in\nhigher education encouraged by the government in the 1990s. The target then set, of increas-\ning the participation rate of 18-19 year-olds from one in five to one in three by the year 2000,\nwas used by the universities as a pathway to a rapid growth and a way of increasing income.\nThe year 2000 target is already in sight and we have a slow-down imposed on us. We have\n30\nAu-J VOLUME 2 NUMBER 1\nalso seen a jump in the numbers of mature students in higher education, a 70% increase in the\n10 years up to 1990. These two factors - more students leading to greater staff-student ratios,\nand an increase in the mature mix - has forced all universities to look at ways of planning\ntheir educational programmes to preserve the best experience, to provide a flexible pattern of\nattendance for mature students and to allow staff to survive all the pressures.\nAgainst this background of increases in participation in higher education, and our desire to\nmaintain quality and widen access, particularly within the wider region that many of the new\nuniversities in the UK serve, we face the pressure of having to deliver even further efficiency\ngains; and all this without increased resources for the university or our students. So a rethink\nis called for in how we make the most effective use of the most costly resource in the univer-\nsity - the staff. We need to adopt new approaches to teaching and learning.\nThere are also positive, pedagogic, reasons for change. There is real evidence that more\nindependent study, flexibility of pace and place, and the appropriate use of technology can\nproduce better results and enhance the transferability of intellectual and personal skills that is\nsought by employers. It allows for greater access via franchises to regional colleges, it\nsupports mature students, and it allows more options to run each year regardless of student\nnumbers.\nAll the evidence is that in facing up to these pressures for change we (as a sector) seem to be\nmoving in three distinct stages. These have been defined by Wagner (1993) as follows:\n\u2022 A first stage is usually more intensive use of existing methods resulting in classes\ngetting larger, options reduced, the hours that students are taught being reduced and\nthe hours that staff teach increased.\n\u2022 The second stage is change but not fundamental change. For example it is realized\nthat seminar groups of 25 begin to challenge the fundamental purpose of seminars.\nSo, some rethinking occurs as to how to make the most cost effective use of both\nthe most valuable and most costly resource in higher education - the time of an\nacademic. This problem has been characterized as the division between 'mass time'\nand 'quality time'. In higher education the tendency has been to increase mass time\nat the expense of quality time.\n\u2022 The third stage is to face the challenge and to turn mass time into quality time and\nmake the whole of higher education a quality experience.\nThis involves the application of appropriate learning-technology skills to the design of the\nsyllabus, the course materials, and the assessment procedures. It takes on board the use of the\nmost appropriate (not necessarily the sexiest) form of delivery.\nIt will always tempt the technocratic mind to think that technology will be able to do what\npeople do, better than they do it already. Over the past two decades technology has been\npushed forward as a way of replacing\/reducing the role of the teacher. But materials based\nwithout good cause on a particular technology platform fail in two ways. First, like bad\nteachers they are inflexible, unadaptive and tiresome; secondly, they provide no exciting\nstimulus to trigger the creative interest of the student. Perhaps we all need to listen to a\ncolleague of mine, Professor Steve Hepple, who often calls for us to begin 'delighting the\nstudent' with our courses.\nSo what is it that we should focus our creative abilities on that will make the most effective\nuse of our time and talents, and that will 'delight' our students? I suggest that there are three\n31\nColin Harrison The role of learning technology in planning change\nbroad issues we must attack quickly if we are to enter \"into stage 3 of Wagner's list. These\nissues are:\n\u2022 the role of the teacher in relationship to the student;\n\u2022 course design and presentation;\n\u2022 assessment models.\nClearly, these issues_are not totally separate, but lead on from one to the other with consider-\nable overlaps in some cases. However, it is helpful to address them as steps in a process, and\nto apply an educational technologist's eye to them.\nThe role of the teacher in relationship to the student\nIn my paper 'Teaching and learning - a strategy for Anglia' (Harrison 1993), I suggest that 'a\nuniversity education is a combination of complex and interacting learning experiences\nincluding, inter alia, formal lectures, tutorials and seminars, work based learning, resource\nmaterials, libraries and computer access, student support services, accommodation and the\nassessment procedures'.\nThe provision of an affordable experience for students depends on a careful analysis of\nrequirements at discipline, course, institutional and employer levels. It must include an\nanalysis of the potential and actual contributions of learning technology to teaching and\nlearning in higher education. My own university is one that prides itself on the quality and\nexpertise of its teaching and learning support staff. In many parts of the course structure,\nstudents have the opportunity for close contact with all these staff through tutorials, seminars,\nlectures and learning support facilities. As part of its continuing evaluation, Anglia Poly-\ntechnic, like all universities, is reviewing its teaching and learning methods. We believe that\nby allowing students more freedom to pace their study and by arranging modules with fewer\nrigidly fixed meeting points, they can organize their own learning more effectively. The\ndevelopment of credit accumulation and modular systems, a fundamental part of Anglia\nstrategy, builds into our courses flexibility for both subject selection and timescales for\ncompletion of courses.\nTo achieve these changes, Anglia has developed new approaches to learning. In doing this, the\nuniversity has cognizance of the interaction between teaching, the formal learning that stems\nfrom the organized structure of the planned teaching process, and the informal learning which\noccurs as a result of and which is encouraged by the flexible study methods and student-group\ninteraction that flexible learning systems engender. This approach starts with the way the\nuniversity clearly states the learning outcomes of undergraduate and postgraduate study, and\nof the individual modules, so that students can easily see what they have to achieve. Staff can\nuse these outcomes to develop assessment methods to test the outcomes and competencies\nmore accurately.\nThe university can also use this foundation to produce planned flexible study materials that\nwill allow some parts of the course to be given to-students early in their year so that they can\norganize their work-flow independently. Some of these materials will contain advice on group\nactivities, and most will contain seminar and tutorial meetings that can be flexibly arranged\nby the students. At the same time, equal attention will be given to ensuring that the best\npractice associated with what has been called 'traditional' teaching is developed and incorpo-\nrated into the strategy.\n32\nAu-J VOLUME 2 NUMBER 1\nThe following represents the heart of the teacher's role:\nKnowing:\n\u2022 the subject;\n\u2022 the students and their needs;\n\u2022 the skills of presenting and managing the materials and processes of learning; and\n\u2022 the best ways of assessing and providing feedback on the learning that is taking\nplace.\nNothing in this suggests that teachers should never stand up in front of a class - nor does it\nsuggest that the main function of a teacher is to stand up in front of a class. Rather, it says that\nthe teacher is the best person to design the course, validate the information content, design the\nassessment, and work with the learners during the delivery phase. How the content is deliv-\nered must vary from module to module and course to course.\nCourse design and preparation .\nAs part of this year's teaching and learning developments at Anglia, as Pro-Vice Chancellor\n(Teaching and Learning) I have called for volunteers to suggest modules they believe can\nbenefit from being presented in a more flexible form. I have no preconceived ideas about that\nform, though I expect that the most popular medium will be print on paper. From research I\nhave recently undertaken, I have developed an approach to the structure of packaged materi-\nals that will, I believe, aid their rapid development, and ensure that we provide our students\nwith a helpful consistency of approach.\nHowever, I do not think that Anglia, or any university, can further impose upon the goodwill\nof its staff by expecting them to undertake the development of flexible materials and continue\nto carry their normal work loads. Because of this, I have recommended that monies be made\navailable to buy out staff from normal duties to allow them safeguarded time to work with\ntrained colleagues in the production of flexible learning materials.\nA new style for flexible learning packages .\nThe planning process\nApplying the techniques of learning technology to this process, one must first look at the\ncontent of the module and what one is trying to achieve from it. A number of decision points\nare discussed below that show that the package should be content-led rather than a decision\nbeing taken at the outset to base the package on a particular technology platform. The key\ndecisions relate to the aims and learning outcomes of the course. Once these are in place, the\nbest way of delivering them can be more reasonably assessed.\nIn using a particular delivery medium, it is important to consider the availability of the\nmechanism for 'playback' to the student who may be working at home or in some other\nremote location from the college where the package was designed.\nWrite, buy, adopt\nBefore jumping into developing new material, it is worth looking around for existing pack-\nages that can easily be adopted\/adapted to meet our needs. Material from the Open Learning\nFoundation or the Open University are examples.\n33\nColin Harrison The role of learning technology in planning change\nContent - write or use textbook, etc.\nA decision point is reached. Does one write the materials oneself and give readings that\nstudents can follow up? Does one build the module around a single book, video, film or\nwhatever, tell the student to buy it, then direct students to use selected passages from it? Does\none mostly write the material, give readings, and include in full some extracts that students\nmight find difficult to find? Copyright regulations and necessary payments to rights holders\nmust be considered. Therefore list the decisions:\n\u2022 Set textbook, student to buy\n\u2022 Recommended readings not included\n\u2022 Selected reading to be included\n\u2022 Video\/audio\/computer materials to be produced.\nIt will be important to talk to the library staff about stocking the necessary titles, and immedi-\nately to discuss media support with one's educational technologist.\nModule overview\nIt will be necessary to prepare a brief statement that will later be used to guide the intending\nstudent in gaining an overview of the content. At this stage, it guides the later development of\nthe module.\nAcademic level\nWill the module be at introductory level, at a higher undergraduate level, or at a postgraduate\nlevel? The approach needs to be set from the start.\nAims of the module\nDeciding on the aims of the module is a major task, and each aim should be large enough so\nthat 10 or more learning outcomes can be derived from their content for trialling and assess-\nment purposes. For example, learners should be able to:\n\u2022 explain the notion of research design and how it relates to the decision problem;\n\u2022 construct a questionnaire;\n\u2022 do some important tests for examining the statistical significance of differences;\n\u2022 carry out, using computer-based procedures, a statistical analysis of a reasonable\ndata set.\nNote that each of these aims must be able to sustain many pages of explanatory text and so\nforth, and provide material for assessment questions. These questions may, in the end, be self-\nassessed by the student, computer-assessed or tutor-assessed.\nFrom each of the aims one will need to develop the appropriate learning outcomes. Each aim\nand its group of learning outcomes will then form a unit of \"study within the module.\nLearning outcomes\nNext, one takes the aims one by one, and one develops the appropriate number of outcomes to\ncover the achievement of each of them. It is often the case that 10 or so learning outcomes\nmay be required to cover a single aim. The validity of an outcome will be tested by quickly\nattempting to devise a dozen or so True or False questions which, while they may never be\nused in the actual learning situation, will show if it is possible to test\/assess completion and\nunderstanding of the outcome. The reasons for different assessment aims is discussed below.\n34\nAIT-J VOLUME 2 NUMBER 1\nAssessment models\nAtkins (1993) identifies several reasons for assessing students. As he puts it, they include:\n\u2022 establishing the level of achievement reached at the end of a course or module;\n\u2022 establishing progress during a course and to give feedback on it;\n\u2022 diagnosing strengths and weaknesses leading to remedial action;\n\u2022 consolidating work done so far - a learning experience in itself;\n\u2022 motivating students;\n\u2022 predicting a student's likely performance level in the future;\n\u2022 determining whether a student is 'safe to practice';\n\u2022 conforming to the requirements of external regulatory bodies;\n\u2022 giving individual staff feedback on the effectiveness of their teaching;\n\u2022 obtaining information on the effectiveness of the learning environment (and\nmethods of presentation);\n\u2022 monitoring standards over time.\nThese headings noted by Atkins provide a very useful guide to the range of questions one\nshould plan to set so that various dimensions of the assessment can be met. Assessment can be\nbuilt up in many ways, and to some extent our decisions will depend on how quickly we can\nprovide a computer-based learning management system to underpin the use of flexible\nmaterials. However, three forms of assessment must first be considered.\nFirst, there will be student-marked feedback questions designed to give assurance that the\nlearners are on the right lines. These questions will test only the outcomes of one unit.\nSecondly, there will be more complex multiple-choice questions that should be computer-\ngenerated and marked from a custom-designed databank. Initially, these may have to be\nmarked by a tutor, or the students trusted to mark them themselves and to hand in the marked\npapers, or marked by a computer using a midway mark sensing card to collect answers. The\nquestions may test integration of learning across two or more units of the module. Answers\ncan be placed as an appendix to the module or issued later (though this creates additional\nwork).\nThirdly, there will be assignments that draw content from the whole module or a major part of\nit, and that will test integration and understanding of the content or ability to perform skills.\nWhile these could be delivered by the computer, they will be tutor-marked. An examination\nmay replace an assignment.\nThis summative and integrating assessment is an essential part of the learning process and\nshould not be seen as 'just another assessment'. It will help 'make thinking and problem\nsolving skills explicit, use holistic tasks, use occupationally relevant simulations' (Thinking\nand Learning at Work 1993). The more assessments integrate learning, the better the course\nand the more helpful the assessment. 'Learners constantly fed on a diet of \"chopped up tasks\"\nmay sometimes never learn to chew or integrate all of the sub skills into one whole complex\ntask.' (Thinking and Learning at Work 1993).\nThe volume of assignments must be related to the need for assuring the student and then\nourselves that they have understood the content and, if appropriate, that they can perform the\ntasks. It should not be excessive and should be paced across the whole module. The weighting\nof assessments must be a matter of debate according to the subject. In designing the way\nassessment is treated in the packages, I confess that I lean towards a model of 'mastery' or\n35\nColin Harrison The role of learning technology in planning change\n'competence'. By this, I mean that the student achieves an acceptable level of performance\nwhen tested against a set of predetermined criteria or standards. The activity can require\nintellectual, personal or practical achievements. They may be tested in a variety of ways. In\nAustralia, I saw an excellent computer system that underpins the Deakin University flexible-\nlearning operations. It can be used just to assess, deliver, monitor, record (and so on) flexible\nmodules, or to deliver and mark assessments for any or all students in the university. Known\nas the Computer Managed Learning (CML) package (Stubbs, 1993), it is a Vax\/VMS-based\nsystem owned by CBTS and Campus America and costs in the order of \u00a315,000 - \u00a320,000. It\ncomes in two versions: the CML, which is the one used at Deakin University, and the CML\/\nCIS, a new release containing extra tools to help with the setting of questions at various levels\nof complexity. It apparently uses a version of Bloom's taxonomy to aid question design. It has\nthe facility to control student progress through courses by releasing tests and assignments, to\nblock progress if defaults are met, to update printed materials as students reach that part of the\ncourse, and to accept 'written' answers and pass them across to staff for on-screen marking\nand feedback. This is currently done via Vax Mail, but the latest release of the software has\nthe facility built within the structure. Staff can then update student marks in real time. Com-\nputer-marked assessments are recorded automatically and students are allowed to pass to the\nnext assessment point as soon as they are ready. It has a wide range of management infor-\nmation. This includes reports on screen or paper about the progress of groups, individuals,\nquestions and how they are answered, cohorts, etc. All the staff who used the package were\nclear that it was rock solid, and they never had software problems. 135 users worldwide use\nCML, some 35 in Australia. Of those in Australia, three have more than 5,000 students using\nthe system.\nA tool like this is an essential part of supporting staff in their coping with the increasing\nvolume of students that we seem destined to have on our campuses. I guess we could each\nwrite our own version, but frankly my advice is to join a club, be it this one or one of the\nothers currently appearing in the market place.\nBuilding in the teacher\nFlexible learning does not imply that the students need be totally 'on their own', and tutorials\ncan be built in as one deems appropriate. Students should have some choice of time and day,\nsomething which allows a package to have the teacher at the centre but also provides freedom\nof choice in attending a centre. Recent findings of what students enjoy most about higher\neducation show that they like smaller group tutorials but can happily do without large-scale\nlectures. This facility could well be extended to distance students, with careful planning, and\nbe delivered by telephone, electronic mail or video conference. There are well-qualified staff\nin regional colleges who can be the local expert to help students using a flexible package.\nFranchising of courses provides for this local support very well indeed.\nThese 'help' points need to be placed in the text of modules with details of how they will\nwork and the location.\nCopyright\nIt is vital to list all material to be reproduced within the learning package. An educational\ntechnologist will then be able to advise on any problems and costs, and will help get clearance\nfor its use. Recent changes in the Copyright Licence mean that additional page charges apply\nif more than four copyright extracts are packaged together for five or more students. With a\n36\nALT-J VOLUME 2 NUMBER 1\nminimum charge of 8 pence per page per copy, this adds significantly to production costs (are\npublishers about to kill the goose with such high charges?).\nEvaluation\nOnce designed and written, all modules will need to go through a peer-group evaluation\nprocess. Necessary revision can then be fed back into the information, design, and layout\ncontents. The final stage will be the testing under user-conditions with even greater feedback\nbeing elicited from the students than one would usually seek. Flexible material, by its nature,\nneeds to be open and accessible to students and to encourage them to return to the study.\nTherefore, the evaluation process must be more than just test results.\nConclusion\nIn summary, flexible packages offer many attractive advantages. They can retain the teacher\nat the centre of the experience. They offer greater choice not only of time, but place and pace\nof study. They offer a way of underpinning summer schools, since materials can be pre-issued\nto clients so that the short time they have is used to full advantage. They allow very rapid\nresponse to industrial needs. They build on the franchised regional links and its strengths.\nThey provide real flexibility for students who cannot atte.nd at fixed times for all sorts of\nreasons. Finally, they offer choice when numbers for a topic may be low.\nReferences\nAtkins, M.J. (1993), Assessment Issues in HES, London, Department of Employment.\nHarrison, C.
