The \nexperiment reported here employed 8 rather than the more usual 2 presentation \ntrials and required subjects to make gender decisions ( is it a male or is it a female \nface?) to both familiar and unfamiliar faces. This allowed the currently favoured \nrecognition unit theories of face processing to be compared with the Logan (1988) \ninstance model.  Equivalent repetition priming effects were observed for both \nfamiliar and unfamiliar faces and were well fitted by power functions. It is argued \nthat the findings are consistent with the strong predictions made by Logan\u2019s \nmodel and pose problems for recognition unit based theories.   \n \n \n \n \nDennis C. Hay                                                                                             Instance Models and  Face Processing     3 \n \n  \nRepetition Priming of Face Gender Judgments: \n     An Instance Based Explanation   \n \n Current theoretical models of face recognition distinguish between the sets \nof processes needed to extract basic information common to all faces ( e.g. \ngender, age, expression, transformations across pose, etc.) and the processes \nrequired to recognise and retrieve information about known faces. For example, in \nthe Hay and Young (1982) model, the Bruce and Young(1986) model and the \nBurton, Bruce and Johnson (1990)  neural network simulation, knowing a face is \nfamiliar requires activation of a face recognition unit (FRU), which in turn allows \naccess to semantic information and finally access to name retrieval. Common to \nthese serial access models is the concept of an FRU;  a device containing both \nthe \u201cessence\u201d of a known face and a set of procedures for matching incoming \nfacial information with this stored internal representation.  These  can best be \ndescribed as abstraction models  in which the  \u2018essence\u2019  of a face is abstracted \nfrom the variety of exposures to this face and requires the discarding of the \nindividuating characteristics of any particular instance of a known face.   FRU\u2019s,  \ntherefore, are direct equivalents of the logogens proposed by Morton (1979) to \nexplain how words are recognise. \n One of the main sources of evidence that has been used to examine the \nvalidity of  FRU based functional models has come from experiments using a \nrepetition priming methodology (Bruce and Valentine 1985; Ellis, Young, Flude \nand Hay 1987).   The results from these studies and the finding that expression \nand gender decisions to photos of famous and unfamiliar  faces speeded \nsubsequent familiarity decisions, led Ellis, Young and Flude (1990) to conclude \nthat repetition priming is confined to the processes invovled in processing familiar \nfaces and not other forms of face processing. In a recent integrative study Ellis, \nFlude, Young and Burton (1996)  identified two loci at which repetition priming in \nprocessing faces operates. The first involves  perceptual recognition of a face as \nDennis C. Hay                                                                                             Instance Models and  Face Processing     4 \n \n  \nfamiliar and is in their view domain specific by which they mean that it is \nrestricted to classes of stimuli having a specialised recognition system (Baddeley, \n1982). That is, previous exposure to a famous face will prime later presentations \nof the same photograph or other similar views but will fail to prime the name of \nthat celebrity. The second locus is at the stage of name retrieval and is domain \nindependent. Thus, previously reading aloud the name of a celebrity will prime \nthe subsequent naming of the face of that celebrity. In a series of experiments Ellis \net al. showed that tasks  involving familiarity or occupational decisions are \nsusceptible to locus 1 priming effects while locus 2 priming is observed in tasks \ninvolving face naming. \n Ellis et al. (1996) argue that the existing face priming data support what \nthey term to be structural theories of face repetition priming in which response \ntime speed up on the second viewing of a known face is  a reflection of the \nstructural change in the activation unit threshold which is lowered by the initial \npresentation of the  face. They also argue that the data pose significant problems \nfor alternative theoretical accounts  in which the internal representation are not \nFRU abstractions but based on the storage of instances or episodes (e.g. Jacoby, \n1983 and Jacoby and Brooks, 1984)  and  suggest repetition priming results from a \nprocess of perceptual enhancement where the memory of a previous encounter \nwith a stimulus facilitates its recognition.  Ellis et al.  direct their criticisms \ntowards one particular instance-based account, that of Logan (1990), which \nattempted to draw parallels between repetition priming and the development of \nautomaticity in task performance following large amounts of practice.  \n  In the Logan model there exist a basic set of algorithms capable of \nprocessing stimuli and that the algorithm used to process a novel face has an \nassociated response time(RT) distribution. Each encounter with a face generates a \nstored representation and each of these instances also has an associated RT \ndistribution. Subsequent recognition is accomplished by a processing race in \nwhich all existing instances race against one another and the basic algorithm. \nDennis C. Hay                                                                                             Instance Models and  Face Processing     5 \n \n  \nLogan (1988) has shown that simulating the race model over a range of algorithm \nand instance parameters always leads to RT functions which are well fitted by \npower functions of the form; \n    RT = a + b (Instance) - c \nwhere a is the function asymptote, b a measure of the difference between initial \nand asymptotic performance and c the learning rate.  \n  Hay (in prep) extended these findings by showing that RT data from a face \nrepetition priming task in which subjects made familiarity decisions (deciding if a \nstimulus face was of a famous celebrity or of a previously unknown person) to the \nsame faces on eight trials also produced power functions of this form. In addition, \nthe data also supported a number of  strong predictions made by the Logan \ninstance model, namely: \n(a) that mean correct RT performance and the variability in \nperformance, as measured by the standard deviation, reduce as \nthe number of trials increase and that both are well fitted by \npower functions with the above form, \n(b) that the mean and the standard deviation power functions share \nthe same exponent, \nand, \n(c) that different quantiles of the RT processing distribution are also \nwell fitted by power functions and that these also share the same \nexponent as the mean and standard deviation functions. \n \n These data offer strong support for an instance based account of face \nrepetition priming and pose serious problems for the abstraction models  based \non FRUs and explain priming as due to the lowering of an FRU activation level on \nthe first encounter with a known face. These are not well enough specified  to \nmake any predictions about the amount of speed-up in RT which should result. In \naddition, Hay found power function RT speed-up for both the familiar and the \nDennis C. Hay                                                                                             Instance Models and  Face Processing     6 \n \n  \ninitially unknown faces. The latter speed-up is particularly problematic for current \nabstractive accounts as priming is based on the functioning of  FRU\u02bcs which only \nexist for known faces. \n \n  However, Ellis et al. (1996) also point out that certain properties of locus 1 \npriming (i.e., recognising that a face is familiar) are difficult for Logan\u2019s instance \nmodel to explain. For example, they cite the Ellis, Young and Flude (1990) study \nshowing that only certain types of face decision are subject to repetition priming. \nGender decisions (is this a male or female face?)  show no priming even when the \nsame photo of a familiar face is seen minutes earlier. Instance models, they argue, \npredict priming as the second presentation should lead to the activation of the \nprevious instance leading to better performance. There are, however,  a number of \nreasons why Logan\u2019s instance model can explain and even predict when such tasks \nshould and should not produce priming. First, in the Logan scheme, an instance \nrelates not to the stimulus alone but to the context in which it is experienced and \nthe response made. Only instances that are sufficiently similar are accessed. In the \nEllis et al. (1990) study subjects generated semantic statements to the stimulus \nfaces on the first occasion while making speeded binary- choice, sex or expression \ndecisions on the second occasion. Thus the two instances require different types of \ndecision and different response outcomes making it debatable whether the prior \ninstance was useful and thus accessed.  \n \n Even in the Ellis et al. experiments when the context was identical it is still \npossible to define the conditions under which the instance model predicts \npriming. At the core of the  model is a race between an algorithm - a base set of \nprocesses - and a set of instances residing in memory. The more instances existing \nin memory the greater the chance that an RT sample from one of the  instance \ndistributions will be the minimum value and win the race. However, it appears \nthat the gender  algorithmic processing is fast - in the Ellis et al. study gender \nDennis C. Hay                                                                                             Instance Models and  Face Processing     7 \n \n  \ndecisions on the first occasion were below 650 ms - so priming by a single  \nprevious instance is only likely if the instance RT distribution mean is lower.  The \ninstance model does predict that speed-up will be observed with increasing \nnumbers of instances irrespective of the distributional parameters (Logan 1988). \n \n The present study sets out to examine certain predictions made by the \nLogan instance model. In particular whether priming does occur with more than \none repetition and whether the strong predictions made concerning the \nobservation of power curves for the indices of performance RT and their \nrelationship hold for making gender decisions for faces.  \n \n \n \nMETHOD \n \nSubjects \n Fifteen psychology students from Lancaster University acted as subjects. \nAll had normal or corrected vision, and had been exposed for a minimum of five \nyears to the British media. They ranged in age from 19 - 32 years and were paid for \nparticipating in this experiment.  \n \nStimuli and  Materials \n Video clips of a range of celebrities were collected from TV productions. \nEach was around 2 minutes duration and contained a range of head movements \nand expression changes. From these twenty-three celebrities were selected to \nsample as wide a range of interests as possible. Twenty, ten males and 10 females, \nwere  used as experimental stimuli and three were used on the lead-in trials. \nSimilarly, clips of unfamiliar faces were collected from German and Dutch TV \nprogrammes and films in an attempt to equate the quality and range of faces. \nDennis C. Hay                                                                                             Instance Models and  Face Processing     8 \n \n  \nTwenty of these were selected to match the chosen celebrities on age, facial hair \nand spectacle use and three for the lead-in trials.  \n \n These video clips yielded eight monochrome images that were \u201cframe-\ngrabbed\u201d using the QuickImage system. The images selected for each individual \nranged from three-quarter right, through full face, to three-quarter left pose and \ncontained a variety of facial expressions.  The selected images were then \nstandardised by first cropping the image to  maximise the amount of facial \ninformation while minimising the amount of background and clothes. Images \nwere then standardised in size (6.5 cm x 4 cm) and equated in brightness and \ncontrast using Adobe Photoshop software on a Macintosh computer. \n The stimuli were presented on Macintosh LCII computers with colour \nmonitors. These were viewed at approximately eye level (i.e. the centre of the \nscreen was 35 cm above the height of the desk at which subjects were seated) and \nsituated behind a black screen situated approximately 60 cm from the subject that \nallowed only the monitor to be viewed. Subjects made their response by pressing \none of two buttons on a box positioned on the desk in front of the subject. The \nbuttons were interfaced to the computer and simulated a single key press of two \nparticular keys (in this case lower case t and o). A filler task was to be used \nbetween experimental blocks to ensure subjects had short breaks. This task \ninvolved rating words and non-words using a seven page booklet. Each of the \neight pages contained  eight letter strings to be rated on several scales. \n \nExperimental Design \n The experimental design and stimulus presentation was handled by the \nSuperLab application for Macintosh computers. Subjects first viewed two screens \nof instructions before completing four practice trials,  two of which presented \nimages of celebrities and two of unfamiliar persons. These were followed by a \nDennis C. Hay                                                                                             Instance Models and  Face Processing     9 \n \n  \nscreen listing the key instructions for the experiment and informing subjects that \nthey now had an opportunity to ask questions.  \n There then followed an experimental block consisting of six lead in trials \n(the data from which did not enter into the analyses) and forty experimental trials. \nBoth the lead in trials and the experimental trials were randomised before each \npresentation and subjects viewed the experimental block eight times. After each \nexperimental block subjects were required to complete one of the pages of the \nword booklet. \n The background colour of the screen for each of the lead in and \nexperimental trials was a pale blue upon which the word \u201cready\u201d appeared in red \nand in letters approximately 1.5 cm tall. This was displayed for 2000 msecs in the \ncentre of the screen and replaced after a 500 msecs blank screen with a central red \ndot. This was presented for 500 msecs and again followed by a 500 msecs blank \nscreen. A stimulus face was then presented centrally for 2500 msecs and subjects \nresponded by pressing one of the two buttons. A further 1000 msecs blank \npreceded the presentation of the next \u201cready\u201d signal that indicated the start of the \nnext block. After each block instructions appeared instructing the subjects to fill in \nthe one of the pages of the word booklet.  \n \nProcedure \n Subjects sat at a desk facing the monitor and were instructed to place the \nindex finger of each hand on the two buttons and to locate the button box in a \ncomfortable position in front of themselves. They were then asked to read the \ninstructions presented on the screen. These indicated that the experiment was \ndesigned to investigate how male and female faces are processed and that a series \nof faces was to be presented some of which would be of famous faces and some of \nunfamiliar faces. Subjects were instructed to decide if a particular face was male \nor female and to indicate their decisions by pressing the appropriate button. They \nwere asked to make decisions as quickly and as accurately as possible and to \nDennis C. Hay                                                                                             Instance Models and  Face Processing     10 \n \n  \ncomplete the practice trials. At the end of these the experimenter indicated what \nthe correct responses were for the practice trials and asked if subjects had any \nquestions. The experimenter then orally repeated the instruction to be as fast and \nas accurate as possible before allowing subjects to start the experiment proper. \nEach subject then completed eight consecutive experimental blocks separated by \none page of the filler task booklet. \n For half the subjects pressing the right button was used to indicate the \nimage was of a celebrity and for half the mapping was reversed. \n \nRESULTS \n \n The analyses were of two forms. First  analyses of variance (ANOVA\u02bcs) \nwere conducted on the response time (RT) data as this is the primary method \nused in previous face research to analyse differences in face processing. Second, \npower curve parameters were fitted to the data as a means of examining the \nvalidity of the instance-based model and to allow comparisons between the forms \nof analysis presented in this study and the series of studies, following Logan \n(1988). \n \nANOVA\u2019s of the Response Time Data \n For each subject the RTs from the 20 male, of which 10 were famous faces \nand 10 were unfamiliar, and the 20 female faces and the errors were collected. \nThese were processed to yield the mean correct RT and the standard deviation for \neach subject for each experimental condition. This generated  a 2 x 2 x 8 within \ndesign (gender of face x familiarity of face x experimental block) and subsequent \nANOVA  revealed the main effect of gender to be significant with it taking 526 ms \nto identify a face as male compared to 548 ms to identify a face as female, F (1,29) \n=  7.51,  MSE = 14852.84, p < 0.05. In addition, performance over the \nexperimental blocks showed a practice curve decrease F (7,203) =  3.928,  MSE = \nDennis C. Hay                                                                                             Instance Models and  Face Processing     11 \n \n  \n5387.97, p < 0.001 (see Table 1).  In order to compare these data with previous \npriming studies a number of additional planned comparisons were conducted.  \nThe data from  Ellis et al. (1990) indicate no priming of gender decisions on a \nsecond gender decision trial. The current data indicate a drop in RT performance \nbut in line with the Ellis et al. study this was found not to be significant.  However \na significant priming effect was found between trials 2 and 3, F(1, 203) = 4.191, \nMSE = 22581.3, p < 0.05. No other significant main effects or interactions were \nobserved. \n \nPower Curve Parameter Estimation \n The instance theory detailed by Logan (1988,1992) makes two   strong \npredictions. First, that data from conditions in which subjects make the same \ndecision to the same stimuli in repeating blocks of trials are well fitted by power \nfunctions of the form; \n RT measure  = a + b(Trial Block)-c \nSecondly, the mean and standard deviation power functions of the data from each \ntype of face should be well fitted by power functions and have the same c \nparameter (Logan 1988).  \n \n The analysis strategy used to examine these predictions involved fitting \npower functions to various RT summaries. A number of different algorithms were \nemployed including using the STEPIT algorithm (Chandler, 1965) used by Logan \n(1988,1992), Newton, Quasi-Newton,  Steepest Descent algorithm (Raner, 1994) \nand the Levenberg-Marquard  algorithm (Press, Flannery, Teukolosky & \nVetterling; 1992). These all produced similar solutions.  The prediction of \ncommon rate exponents was examined by constraining the c parameter to be \nequal across functions while allowing the other parameters to vary freely, and to \nselect the common exponent that minimised the error fit statistics for the \nfunctions under consideration. The constrained fits could then be compared with \nDennis C. Hay                                                                                             Instance Models and  Face Processing     12 \n \n  \nthe unconstrained fits as a means of examining the validity of the instance theory \npredictions (Logan 1988). \n \n Power functions were fit to the overall mean correct RT and standard \ndeviation data (see Figure 1) and the estimated parameters and the measures of \ngoodness of fit are presented in Table 2. These clearly show that the data are well \nfitted by power functions of the form specified by Logan which explain the vast \nmajority of the observed variance. Moreover, when the exponents for means and \nstandard deviations were constrained to be the equal and to minimise the the \nresulting error measures, the decrease in explained variance was found to be \nminimal and non-significant for both the mean and the standard deviation data \n(see Table 2). \n \n \nDISCUSSION \n \n The results from the current experiment are unambiguous. It is clear that \nrepetition priming  does not depend solely on the identity processing system as \nreductions in processing speed for subsequent items is found for  familiar and \nunfamiliar faces and that the degree of primng is equivalent for both classes of \nstimulus. In addition, the conditions under which repetition priming can be \nobserved in gender decision making has been clarified. If only the first two trials \nare considered then the data  replicate the findings of  Ellis et al. (1990) by \nshowing no evidence of   repetition priming. However, in line with the predictions \nmade by Logan\u2019s instance model, priming is in evidence with subsequent \nrepetitions.  Thus a change from algorithmic processing to instance based \nretrieval in gender decisions is only possible if sufficient instances exist. This, in \nturn,  makes it statistically more likely for one of the instances to be retrieved \nbefore the fast algorithmic processing can be accomplished. In fact, performance \nDennis C. Hay                                                                                             Instance Models and  Face Processing     13 \n \n  \non trial block one, which reflects only algorithmic processing, was found to be fast \n(562 ms) and reflects an efficient algorithm which is applied to the processing of \nall faces.   \n \n At a theoretical level, the results are difficult to  encompass within current \nabstraction models which assume repetition priming  occurs only within the \nsystem that stores representations of the appearance of familiar faces (Ellis et al. \n1990, Ellis et al., 1996). In this experiment repetition priming was observed in a \ngender decision task and to be equivalent for both familiar and unfamiliar faces \n(see Figure 1) confirming previous observations of unfamiliar face priming \n(Bentin & Moscovitch, 1988; Hay, in prep.).  In contrast, the data are entirely \nconsistent with memory models which are episodic based (Jacoby, 1983) and \nparticularly  Logan\u2019s (1988) instance model which not only predicts power \nfunction repetition priming speed-up but can predict the conditions under which \nrepetition priming can be observed in gender decision tasks.  \n \n Some form of integration, however, may be possible as the Burton et al. \n(1990) model is based on the interactive activation model suggested by \nMcClelland and Rumelhart (1981). More recent and comprehensive versions of \nthis seek to explain the development of what appear to be abstractive word and \nconcept units as resulting from storage of all instances of the word or concept \n(McClelland and Rumelhart, 1985). Models such as these respond strongly to \nprototypical patterns while also responding strongly to recent instances in the \ntraining set. However adopting such a position  involves embracing the concept of \nabstractions based on instances and viewing face priming as being dependent on \nthe number of \u201cappropriate\u201d instances available on any task. This may also be \nimportant for attempts to explain how FRU are formed in the first place. \n \n \nDennis C.
