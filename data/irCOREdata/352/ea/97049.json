Maini \/ Mathematical Biosciences 209 (2007) 30\u201350 31determining cell arrangement and\/or fate via differing responses to threshold levels of morphogen\nconcentration [1,2]. As such, this type of patterning provides a highly efficient mechanism for cre-\nating complex patterns in the embryo and there are numerous examples of the roles of morpho-\ngens in developmental systems. For example: neuronal subtype specification in the developing\ncentral nervous system (CNS) is controlled by a gradient of Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) [3]; formation\nof the dorsal pattern in Drosophila is controlled by gradients of Screw (Scw) and Decapentaplegic\n(Dpp) [4]; antero-posterior (AP) patterning in the chick limb is controlled by a gradient of Shh\narising from a polarising region at the posterior edge of the limb bud [5].\nTypical morphogen gradient models assume that a morphogen produced at a localised source\ndiffuses across a target field to set up an extracellular gradient. Cells then determine their position\nwithin the field by interpretation of the morphogen gradient, activating specific programs of dif-\nferentiation at discrete morphogen thresholds [5]. A lesser cited way in which morphogens provide\ninformation for differentiation is via the action of a gradient which travels across the target field\nover time [6,7]. In these models, there is ordinarily a single morphogen threshold and progression\nof the threshold across the field acts to control the time of onset of differentiation rather than to\nselect the program of differentiation: it is generally assumed that the program itself is already\ndecided. In addition the picture has been complicated by the discovery that in some settings dif-\nferent morphogens act in combination with one another to set thresholds for development: for\nexample, recent studies have shown that some developmental systems require two morphogens\nwhich mutually inhibit each other [8].\nTo understand the mechanisms underlying the formation and maintenance of any gradient we\nshould ideally know the exact identity of the morphogens involved, rates of morphogen release,\ndiffusion and decay, etc. For most morphogens, these aspects are not very well understood and\nthis is where mathematical modelling can play an important role. It may be used to investigate\nthe feedback mechanisms underlying gradient formation, for example, how the activity of a pri-\nmary morphogen may be partly controlled by the action of secondary morphogens, or the range\nof influence of a gradient. In addition, mathematical modelling can be used to make predictions\nand experimentally testable hypotheses which further understanding in the area.\nHowever, as important as the study of the above mechanisms, is the study of gradient robust-\nness: biological systems are subject to stochastic effects from a variety of sources. There are many\nways to define \u2018robustness\u2019 but one which encompasses a wide range of meanings is \u2018a measure of\nhow sensitive the output of a system is to perturbation\u2019. In the context of a mathematical model,\nperturbation generally means variation in model parameters or initial conditions. We note that\nparameters may be changed in a \u2018step-wise manner\u2019, that is, a parameter value may be changed\nfrom one value to another between different simulations, or in a \u2018noisy\u2019 manner, that is, a param-\neter may make small, random departures from its chosen value at each time step of a particular\nsimulation. The former may be valid when considering, for example, the effect of temperature\nchange on a system [9] \u2013 this may affect production and decay rates. On the other hand, if only\none or two gene copies are responsible for mRNA transcription in a system, there is bound to be\nvariability in this rate from one time interval to another \u2013 this is where the latter line of investi-\ngation becomes important.\nThere has been much theoretical and experimental investigation of morphogen gradients (see,\nfor theoretical models, [10,11]), including the mechanisms via which a robust gradient may be\nachieved [9,12,13]. In each case static morphogen gradients are studied, and robustness is defined\n32 R.E. Baker, P.K. Maini \/ Mathematical Biosciences 209 (2007) 30\u201350as the ability of the system to adjust to changes in parameter values, such that the position of a\nthreshold in morphogen concentration remains virtually unaltered. Bollenbach and co-workers\nshow that robustness of a single morphogen gradient may arise as a result morphogen transport\nvia a series of transcytotic events [12], whilst Houchmandzadeh and co-workers and Aegerter-\nWilmsen and co-workers consider the addition of a secondary morphogen in order to generate\na robust response to domain scaling [9,13]. One other study investigates stationary gradients of\nBicoid in the Drosophila embryo; postulating the existence of a secondary morphogen to ensure\nrobust activation of downstream genes such as hunchback [14].\nDevelopment is a precise process, yet all biochemical processes are prone to variation: our\nhypothesis is that the addition of secondary morphogens could provide a more stable mechanism\nfor the formation of travellingmorphogen gradients. Theoretical investigation of a system consist-\ning of two negatively regulating morphogens permits us to address this hypothesis and investigate\nwhether this process leads to more robustly controlled travelling gradients.\n1.1. Aims and outline\nIn this article we will be interested in a scenario in which the interactions of two negatively reg-\nulating morphogens lead to gradients which travel across a developmental field, activating, as they\ntravel, a program of further differentiation. We will base our study on the interactions of Fibro-\nblast Growth Factor 8 (FGF8) and retinoic acid (RA) seen to occur along the antero-posterior\n(AP) axis of vertebrate embryos: the expression gradients formed have been shown to be impor-\ntant in segmentation of the vertebrate axis and also in neuronal differentiation [8,15]. We begin by\noutlining our context for investigation in more detail: highlighting the salient factors leading to\nthe formation of gradients in FGF8 and RA along the AP axis and their role in development.\nWe then construct a general model which can be used to investigate the system, presenting both\nanalytical results and numerical simulations. Before carrying out extensive analysis of this system,\nwe consider the case in which the secondary morphogen is removed: this case is much easier to\ninvestigate and provides important insight into the general model. Finally we discuss our results,\navenues for future exploration and the implications for such mechanisms in development.2. The developmental context\nIn this article, the specific developmental scenario which we will model is the interplay of two\nopposingmorphogens, FGF8 andRA, involved in the progressive maturation of the vertebrate em-\nbryo along its AP axis [8,15]. AlthoughRAandFGF8 have long since been shown to act asmorpho-\ngens in many different developmental contexts [16\u201323] it is only recent studies that have shown that\nopposing gradients of RA and FGF8 travelling down the embryonic AP axis are essential for seg-\nmentation of the vertebrate AP axis into somites and for coordinated neuronal differentiation and\nventral patterning [6,24\u201326]. It is this phenomenon in which we will be interested in this article.\nSomites, the precursors of the vertebrae, ribs and associated muscles of the trunk, are derived\nfrom two parallel bands of tissue known as the pre-somitic mesoderm (PSM) that lie on either side\nof the midline of the embryo. At regular time intervals (every 90 min in the chick [27]), a group of\ncells at the anterior end of the PSM undergo changes in their adhesive and migratory properties\nR.E. Baker, P.K. Maini \/ Mathematical Biosciences 209 (2007) 30\u201350 33and coalesce to form an epithelial block of cells known as a somite [28]. Somites form in strict AP\nsequence [29\u201331] and this budding of cells from the anterior part of the PSM compensates for the\naddition of cells at the posterior end of the PSM as the body axis lengthens. In this way, the PSM\ntravels down the AP axis, remaining approximately constant in length throughout the process of\nsegmentation, and a wave of cell determination appears to sweep along the AP axis behind the\nPSM leaving somites in its wake [32,33].\nThe most commonly accepted mechanism for somitogenesis is the \u2018Clock and Wavefront\u2019 mod-\nel, first postulated by Cooke and Zeeman [34]. Recent experimental observations have shown that\nFGF8 provides a likely candidate for the wavefront [6], and there is wide evidence for the segmen-\ntation clock [35]. With the discovery of these factors, Pourquie\u00b4 and co-workers have proposed a\nrevised version of the \u2018Clock and Wavefront\u2019 model [6,36,37]. They hypothesise that there is some\ninteraction between the wavefront of FGF8 and the segmentation clock in the PSM that acts to\ngate cells into potential somites. FGF8 is expressed at a high level in the posterior PSM, and the\ngradient of FGF8 regresses along the AP axis as the embryo develops, so that cells gradually go\nfrom regions of high to low FGF8 signalling. For a cell at a particular point, they assume that\ncompetence to segment will only be achieved once the FGF8 gradient has regressed far enough\nalong the AP axis and FGF8 signalling has decreased below a certain threshold.\nIt is postulated that the FGF8 gradient arises via a feedback loop with RA: FGF8 may either\ndown-regulate RA production via repression of the enzyme Raldh2, or it may increase the rate of\nRA decay; in turn RA may either down-regulate FGF8 production by restricting fgf8 mRNA\ntranscription or it may accelerate the rate of decay via the MPK3 pathway [24].\n2.1. Objectives for the model\nWe will be interested in constructing a model consisting of non-linear, coupled partial differen-\ntial equations: one equation describing the dynamics of FGF8 and another the dynamics of RA.\nWe will explore the system in one spatial dimension, along the AP axis, and look for travelling\nwave solutions, which correspond to gradients of FGF8 and RA moving along the AP axis. In\nthe scenario under consideration, FGF8 expression is highest in the posterior end of the embryo\n(denoted here by letting x!1) and this gradient regresses along the axis in a posterior direction\nas development proceeds (i.e., the interface between high and low FGF8 signalling travels in a\npositive x direction).\nBefore beginning our investigation, we outline a definition of robustness for this system. First, we\nnote that in order for the model to be able to exhibit travelling waves of expression which are robust\nto small variation in FGF8\/RA concentrations ahead and behind the travelling wavefront, we need\nto restrict ourselves towaves which connect steady states of the form (f*,0) and (0,a*) which are both\nlinearly stable. Our reasoning for this goes as follows: supposing we have a scenario in which a trav-\nellingwave connects a state (f*,0), which is linearly unstable, to a state (0,a*), which is linearly stable.\nIt is possible that small perturbations in either f or a could be applied to the system due to slight\nchanges in morphogen production, decay or other, possibly external, factors. If they occur in the re-\ngion of the axis not yet reached by the wavefront (i.e., as x!1) then these perturbations will grow\nsince the state is unstable, and it is possible that the gradient could be destroyed. Hence in this work,\nwe will consider waves of the above form and explore the effects upon these travelling waves of vary-\ning the type and strength of interactions between FGF8 and RA.\n34 R.E. Baker, P.K. Maini \/ Mathematical Biosciences 209 (2007) 30\u201350Second, we would like to explore the response of the system to \u2018step-wise\u2019 parameter changes\nand we will characterise this response in terms of the speed (and shape) of the travelling wave-\nfront. Our primary interest will be to explore the range of parameters for which the wavefront\ntravels in a positive x direction (for the reasons described earlier); an increase in robustness would\nbe indicated by a widening of this parameter space. However, the actual speed of wavefront pro-\ngression is also important. We will also infer from our results which types of morphogen interac-\ntion lead to a more tightly controlled wave speed.3. Mathematical model\nAs discussed in the opening sections, we will investigate the negative feedback interactions be-\ntween two morphogens, FGF8 and RA, which lead them to form gradients in their expression\nlevels which travel along the AP axis of vertebrate embryos. The ability of cells to differentiate\nis controlled by the time at which FGF8 levels reach some critical threshold: in this way, the pro-\ngram of development is controlled temporally and spatially by the morphogen. The type and\nstrength of interactions between the morphogens will control the shape of the gradients and\nthe rate at which they travel along the AP axis.\nWe consider an infinite, one-dimensional domain, the x axis (corresponding to the AP axis with\nthe tail of the embryo lying towards x =1), and we will assume that the concentrations of the\nmorphogens are bounded as x! \u00b11. Our two morphogens will be labelled F and A (after\nFG8 and RA) and we suppose that their interactions are limited to those depicted in Fig. 1\n(although all such interactions may not necessarily occur). The most general mathematical model\ndescribing this system can be written asFig. 1\nunder\naugm\nthose\nversiooF\not\n\u00bc pF \u00f0F ;A\u00de \u0002 dF \u00f0F ;A\u00de \u00fe DF\no2F\nox2\n; \u00f01\u00de\noA\not\n\u00bc pA\u00f0F ;A\u00de \u0002 dA\u00f0F ;A\u00de \u00fe DA\no2A\nox2\n; \u00f02\u00de.

DF and DA are the respective diffusion rates of F and A and we assume, for the sake of\nsimplicity, that spreading of the morphogens takes places solely by diffusion [38].\nIn order for the system to display the behaviour shown in Fig. 1 these functions must have the\nfollowing properties:\u00f0i\u00de opF\noA\n6 0; opF\noF\nP 0;\nodF\noF\nP 0 and\nodF\noA\nP 0;\n\u00f0ii\u00de opA\noF\n6 0; opA\noA\nP 0;\nodA\noA\nP 0 and\nodA\noF\nP 0:The first and fourth restrictions for F ensure that A is able to either down-regulate F production\nor upregulate F decay (or both), the second ensures that F is self-activating and the third simply\nthat the rate of F decay increases with increasing F. The second set of requirements ensures similar\nbehaviour for A. In order to have travelling waves which are robust to external perturbations, we\nalso require the system to have a set of spatially uniform steady states which includes at least one\nstable state each of the form (F,A) = (F*,0), (0,A*).\nIn order to satisfy these requirements we choose to investigate the system:oF\not\n\u00bc rF F\nn1\nln1F \u00fe F n1\nkn2F\nkn2F \u00fe An2\n\u0002 gF \u00fe\nsF A\nn3\nbn3F \u00fe An3\n\u0002 \u0003\nF\u00fe DF o\n2F\nox2\n; \u00f03\u00de\noA\not\n\u00bc rAA\nn4\nln4A \u00fe An4\nkn5A\nkn5A \u00fe F n5\n\u0002 gA \u00fe\nsAF n6\nbn6A \u00fe F n6\n\u0002 \u0003\nA\u00fe DA o\n2A\nox2\n; \u00f04\u00dewhere the ni (i = 1, . . . , 6) are chosen to be integers greater than unity and the remaining\nparameters are positive constants. Here F production is self-regulatory, with maximal produc-\ntion rate rF, and the rate of F production is decreased by the presence of A. In the absence of\nA, F decays linearly but the decay rate is increased by the presence of A, up to a maximal rate\nof gF + sF. Similar statements are true for A. We also note that this model allows us to con-\nsider the effects of removing either morphogen: in Eq. (3) when we remove A the first fraction\ninvolving A becomes unity and the second becomes zero. Similarly for Eq. (4) and removing\nF.\nWe note that, in this model, we are implicitly assuming that both morphogens are present in\nhigh enough concentrations to average out the fluctuations in production\/decay rates which arise\non the individual molecule level.3.1.

Numerical simulation\nThe system described by Eqs. (5) and (6) must be solved numerically and the results of numer-\nical simulation for a particular set of parameter values are shown in Fig. 2. The system is solved\nusing the MATLAB solver pdepe with the infinite domain approximated by a finite domain with\nzero flux boundary conditions for both morphogens. The initial conditions are such that F is in\na non-zero, stable steady state for n < 0 and zero on the remainder of the domain, and vice versa\nfor A. For the set of parameter values chosen, the waves move in a positive direction over time,\nindicating a regressing gradient of morphogen F and an advancing gradient of A. After an initial\ntransient period, the wavefront assumes constant shape and moves along the axis with constant\nspeed. In a biological context, this could be equivalent to conferring the ability to differentiate,\u201310 0 10 20 30\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\u03be\nf\nTravelling wave in  F\n\u201310 0 10 20 30\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n\u03be\na\nTravelling wave in  A\n.

Maini \/ Mathematical Biosciences 209 (2007) 30\u201350 37or initiating a developmental program at a constant rate upon cells which are evenly distributed\nalong some developmental axis.\nWe are predominantly interested in how the presence of a secondary morphogen, which\nhere we will choose to be A, influences the shape and speed of a travelling wave of primary\nmorphogen (here F). The system described above is complex, partly since it is designed to cap-\nture both possibilities for regulation: suppression of morphogen production and increase in\nmorphogen decay. It is therefore difficult to gain much insight into the model without the sup-\nport of insight gained from the case in which we have a single morphogen, and so it is to this\ncase we turn first.4. The case in which A is removed\nThe purpose here is to investigate the \u2018knockout\u2019 case in which the secondary morphogen, A, is\nremoved. This is a simplified form of the system, which is easier to tackle analytically, and which\nwill give important insights into the more general case.

Maini \/ Mathematical Biosciences 209 (2007) 30\u201350where 0 = d\/dz. Letting f 0 = g we can determine the stabilities of the three steady states in the (f, f 0)\nphase plane: (0,0) is a saddle point; \u00f0f \u0004\u0002; 0\u00de is a stable node or spiral; \u00f0f \u0004\u00fe; 0\u00de is a saddle point. In\nthis case, there are three possibilities for travelling waves: the first connects (0,0) to \u00f0f \u0004\u0002; 0\u00de; the\nsecond connects \u00f0f \u0004\u00fe; 0\u00de to \u00f0f \u0004\u0002; 0\u00de; and the third connects (0,0) to \u00f0f \u0004\u00fe; 0\u00de. For reasons discussed\nearlier, we will be interested in the third case, for which (by continuity arguments [39,40]) there\nis a unique wave speed, c.\nSpecifying f \u00f01\u00de \u00bc f \u0004\u00fe and f(\u00021) = 0, so that F is at its upper steady state towards the tail of\nthe embryo, we can multiply Eq. (14) by f 0 and integrate with respect to z to obtain the following\nexpression for the wave speed:c \u00bc \u0002\nZ f \u0004\u00fe\n0\nrf f n1\n1\u00fe f n1 \u0002 gf f\n\u0005 \u0006\ndf\nZ 1\n\u00021\n\u00f0f 0\u00de2dz\n\u0007\n: \u00f015\u00deHence the sign of the wave speed is determined by the sign of the numerator integral of Eq. (15),\nwhich we will denote as I = I(bf,n1). For a regressing gradient of F along the axis, as in Fig. 2, we\nrequire c > 0: whether this actually occurs or not is dependent on the parameter bf. Fig. 4 shows\nhow the wave speed depends on bf and n1. As bf increases (so that the decay rate increases relative\nto the maximal production rate) the wave is more likely to travel in a negative direction, whilst\nincreasing the Hill function coefficient is more likely to make the wave travel in a positive direc-\ntion. The latter suggests that a more defined \u2018on\u2013off switch\u2019 of F production and a smaller mor-\nphogen decay rate relative to production rate are more likely to force the wave to travel in a\npositive direction. These results will be investigated more thoroughly in the following sections.\nFor each value of n1 there will be a corresponding critical value of bf such that I = 0: this can be\nseen by considering the f null cline (see Fig. 3 and consider the changes in the null cline as bf\nchanges). The critical value of bf may be determined analytically, but apart from a couple of lim-\niting cases (specifically n1 = 2 and n1 !1) the integrals are tedious to calculate (being composed\n10 20 30\n\u20130.04\n0.00\n0.04\n0.08\n0.12\nHill coefficient (n1)\nN\num\ner\nat\nor\n o\nf w\nav\ne \nsp\nee\nd \n[si\ngn\n=\u2013\nsi\ngn\n(c)\n] Variation of wave direction with n1 and bf\nbf=0.49\nbf=0.51\nbf=0.53\nFig. 4. Variation in the direction of wave progression with n1 and bf. The sign of the numerator integral (vertical axis) is\nopposite to the sign of the wave speed: for each value of bf and n1, the wave moves in a positive direction when the point\nlies below zero. The graph shows that if initially the wave moves in a negative direction, increasing n1 may force it to\nmove in a positive direction. The graph also suggests that a decrease in bf is more likely to result in a wave travelling in a\npositive direction. Note that as bf lies above b\ncritu\nf for some smaller values of n1, no gradient exists.\nR.E. Baker, P.K. Maini \/ Mathematical Biosciences 209 (2007) 30\u201350 39of Hypergeometric functions). In the next couple of sections we investigate these limiting cases\nbefore turning our attention to numerical calculation of the remainder of the cases.\n4.1.1.

Since the two non-zero steady states, f \u0004\u0005,\nonly exist for bf < 1\/2 we note that there is only a very small region of bf for which the wave travels\nin a positive direction. This suggests that a mechanism for gradient formation which obeys the\nkinetics of Eq. (16), i.e., one in which there is a single morphogen which has Hill function produc-\ntion kinetics with Hill coefficient equal to two, would not be robust to external perturbations and\nhence would be likely to lead to developmental anomalies.

It is interesting to note that the\nregion of bf-space for which the wave moves in a positive direction is significantly greater than\nthat for n1 = 2. This suggests that increasing n1 increases the robustness of the model, in the sense\nthat it widens the parameter space over which the wave travels in a positive x direction.\n4.1.3. The remaining cases\nThe remaining cases cannot easily be dealt with analytically and so we use numerical techniques\nto determine the lower bound, bcritlf , for which the wave moves in a positive direction. This critical\nvalue is found by numerically determining f \u0004\u00fe and I(bf,n1): a bisection method is employed to\ndetermine where the sign of I(bf,n1) changes.\nThe results of Fig. 6 show that as n1, the Hill coefficient controlling F production, increases\nthe range of bf for which the wave travels in a positive direction expands to over ten times its\nvalue for n1 = 2. Fig. 6(a) shows the window for small values of n1 whilst Fig. 6(b) demon-\nstrates the extent to which the window expands as n1 becomes very large. These results show\nthat in order to achieve a robust mechanism for gradient formation, in the sense described in\nSection 4.1.2, n1 should be large.

Numerical solution\nNumerical solutions of the system are shown in Fig. 7 for two sets of parameter values. In\nboth cases, the wave travels in a positive direction since the parameters are chosen within the\nwindow \u00f0bcritlf ; bcrituf \u00de. In general, numerical investigation shows that increasing n1 increases the\nsteady state level of F, f \u0004\u00fe, increases the slope of the wave and correspondingly decreases the\nwave speed. These changes in steady state and wave speed as a function of bf are shown in\nFig. 8(a). The opposite effects are seen to occur with changes in gf and this is demonstrated\nin Fig. 8(b).5. The full model\nArmed with some insight into the problem we now return to the full model outlined in Sec-\ntion 3. As before, we investigate linear stability and the possibilities for travelling wavefronts,\nbefore using numerical techniques to determine the effects of a secondary morphogen. Before\nstarting, we note that in Fig. 2 (which shows simulations of the full model) the parameters are\nsuch that bf = 0.25 which puts bf < b\ncritl\nf , yet the wave still moves in a positive direction.

The velocity field is indicated by yellow arrows and the trajectories in blue.\nThe broken lines in (b) denote the separatrix: trajectories with initial conditions on the dashed line go to the steady state\nwith higher F and A whilst on the dotted line they tend to zero. Either side of the broken lines, the trajectories tend to\nthe steady states \u00f0f \u0004\u00fe; 0\u00de or \u00f00; a\u0004\u00fe\u00de. Parameters are as follows: rf = 1.5, ra = 1.5, gf = 0.3, ga = 0.3, sf = 0.1, sa = 0.1,\nbf = 3.0, ba = 3.0, ni = 4 for i = 1, . . . , 4, ni = 2 for i = 5, 6. Case I: kf = 0.5, ka = 0.5; Case II: kf = 2.0, ka = 2.0. (For\ninterpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)\nR.E.

In all cases, we have the steady state (f,a) = (0,0) and when the\nconditions above are satisfied we also have four further steady states: \u00f0f ; a\u00de \u00bc \u00f0f \u0004\u0005; 0\u00de and\n\u00f0f ; a\u00de \u00bc \u00f00; a\u0004\u0005\u00de.\nUnder the parameter conditions outlined above, there are two general possibilities for the phase\nplane, and null clines for these cases are plotted in Fig. 9, along with the velocity field and the\ntrajectories. Case I, depicted in Fig. 9(a), shows the scenario in which there are no steady states\nwith both F and A non-zero, whilst Case II, depicted in Fig. 9(b), shows the scenario in which\nthere are two steady states with both F and A non-zero. In general, it is not possible to calculate\nthese steady states explicitly, but after numerical examination of the phase plane we conclude that\nthe parameters kf and ka play the greatest role in determining whether Case I or Case II arises: in\nFig. 9, these are the only parameters which are changed between the two plots. For simplicity, we\nshall only consider Case I.\n5.2. Linear stability\nWe linearise the system about the fixed points so that stability is given by the eigenvalues of the\nmatrix Mls evaluated at the steady states, whereMls \u00bc\nopf\nof \u0002\nodf\nof\nopa\nof \u0002 odaof\nopf\noa \u0002\nodf\noa\nopa\noa \u0002 odaoa\n0\n@\n1\nA; \u00f023\u00de\n44 R.E.

The linear\nstability of the five fixed points given above can be calculated as follows: (f,a) = (0,0) is a stable\nnode; \u00f0f ; a\u00de \u00bc \u00f0f \u0004\u0002; 0\u00de is a saddle point; \u00f0f ; a\u00de \u00bc \u00f0f \u0004\u00fe; 0\u00de is a stable node; \u00f0f ; a\u00de \u00bc \u00f00; a\u0004\u0002\u00de is a saddle\npoint; \u00f0f ; a\u00de \u00bc \u00f00; a\u0004\u00fe\u00de is a stable node.\nWe can also determine the sign of the eigenvalues of the other two possible fixed points\n(when they exist) by considering the manner in which the null clines intersect. In doing so\nwe see that: \u00f0f ; a\u00de \u00bc \u00f0f y\u0002; ay\u0002\u00de is an unstable point; \u00f0f ; a\u00de \u00bc \u00f0f y\u00fe; ay\u00fe\u00de is a saddle point. The\nstability of these points is demonstrated in Fig. 9 using the velocity field and trajectory\nplots.\n5.3. Travelling waves\nAs mentioned above, we are interested in travelling waves which connect two stable steady\nstates, one with high f and low a and the other with low f and high a: here these are the points\n\u00f0f \u0004\u00fe; 0\u00de and \u00f00; a\u0004\u00fe\u00de. We use the travelling wave ansatz z = n \u0002 cs to transform Eqs. (5) and (6)\nto the following system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\u0002cf 0 \u00bc pf \u00f0f ; a\u00de \u0002 df \u00f0f ; a\u00de \u00fe Df 00; \u00f024\u00de\n\u0002ca0 \u00bc pa\u00f0f ; a\u00de \u0002 da\u00f0f ; a\u00de \u00fe a00; \u00f025\u00de\nwhere 0 = d\/dz.

Since all the eigenvalues for these steady states are purely real, whatever the\nparameter values, we cannot establish from this analysis a minimum wave speed, only that the\ngradients of both f and a will be monotonic in z.\nAs before, we can determine the sign of the wave speed by multiplying Eqs. (24) and (25) by f 0\nand a 0, respectively, and integrating with respect to z.

First, we note that in the above equations,\nf and a are not independent of each other, so in order to compute the value of either If or Ia, a\nmust be found as a function of f or vice versa. Second, we also note that the expressions together\nform a \u2018consistency condition\u2019 for f, a, f 0 and a 0.\nThe first point above requires If to be computed along a certain curve which lies within the re-\ngion of (f,a) space bounded by the lines f \u00bc 0; f \u0004\u00fe and a \u00bc 0; a\u0004\u00fe.

In other words, the presence of a secondary morphogen\nincreases the robustness of the primarymorphogen gradient to changes in the systemparameters, by\nwidening the parameter space in which the wavefront travels in a positive x direction.\nFig. 10 shows the actual change in wave speed as kf and sf are varied.

Fig. 10(b) demonstrates the increase inwave speed as sf\nis increased: this can be understood by reasoning that increased decay ofF leads to an increase in the\nrate ofA production, so thatAmay advance along the axismore quickly. In this case, we see that the\nchange in wave speed as sf varies becomes less marked as sf becomes large. It should be noted that\nalthough the plots in Fig. 10 are on different scales, our results suggest that a relatively high value\nof sf is preferable to a relatively low value of kf. In other words, increasing the rate of primary mor-\nphogen decay by the addition of a secondarymorphogen seems to be amore robustmechanism than\ndecreasing the rate of primary morphogen production by the addition of a secondary morphogen.6. Discussion\nIn this work, we have investigated possible mechanisms by which two morphogens may interact\nin order to produce travelling wavefronts of expression along some developmental axis. The mod-\nels constructed were based on a specific developmental context: the gradients of FGF8 and RA\nwhich exist along the AP axis of vertebrate embryos, controlling axis segmentation and neuronal\ndifferentiation. We started by constructing a generic model from basic experimental hypotheses,\nwhich we investigated both analytically and numerically. In order to gain insight into the model,\nand to compare with the case of a single morphogen, we first investigated a \u2018knockout\u2019 case in\nwhich the secondary morphogen, taken to be A, was removed.\nIn the single morphogen case, we found a condition for the existence of travelling wave\nsolutions and a further condition which must be satisfied by the model parameters in order\nto ensure that the wave of F regresses along the AP axis with time, i.e., that it moves in a\npositive direction. We showed that if production of the morphogen is controlled by Hill-type\nkinetics, a small Hill coefficient results in only a small window of parameter space that gives\nrise to regressing waves of F. Increasing the Hill coefficient widens the parameter window,\neventually to over ten times its original value, thereby making the system more robust to\nchanges in parameter values, which may arise due to variations in morphogen production\nor decay, or from external factors.\nUpon returning to the dual morphogen case, we were able to use these results to show that the\npresence of a secondary morphogen is able to widen the parameter space for which the waves re-\ngress along the axis. In this way, the two-morphogen model increases the robustness of the model\nto perturbation \u2013 it is more able to display the required behaviour as model parameters are varied.\nEarlier in this work we described another aim: to elucidate the robustness of the wave speed to\nchanges in parameter values. Both suppression of primary morphogen production and increase in\nprimary morphogen decay by a secondary morphogen were show to increase the speed of the\nwavefront. However, it seems that as the effect of a on f decay increases, the change in the speed\nof the wavefront decreases, whilst increasing the effect of a of f production has the opposite effect.\nTherefore we postulate that the presence of a secondary morphogen, acting to increase the decay\nrate of a primary morphogen, will lead to a more robust mechanism for development, both in\nterms of an increased parameter space for a positive wave speed and the change in wave speed\nas the strength of the secondary morphogen increases.\n48 R.E. Baker, P.K. Maini \/ Mathematical Biosciences 209 (2007) 30\u201350It is somewhat difficult to compare the results of our model to others which consider the role of\nsecondary morphogens [9,13]. The reasons for this are as follows: first, our gradients are not sta-\ntionary, second we consider their formation on an infinite, rather than a bounded domain, and\nthird we consider a fairly generic system, rather than a specific developmental context. It is our\naim that the knowledge and insight gained from this study will provide a foundation upon which\nmore biologically accurate models may be built.\n6.1. Application to models for somite formation\nSeveral mathematical models for somite formation have been suggested in recent years, includ-\ning one by the authors [41,42], which is based on the version of the \u2018Clock and Wavefront\u2019 model\nformulated by Pourquie\u00b4 and co-workers [6,36,37]. To date these models only consider a gradient\nof FGF8 along the AP axis: they are able to reproduce coherent somite formation and the anom-\nalies observed experimentally upon local perturbation of the FGF8 gradient [6]. However, since\nRA is not explicitly modelled, they are not able to reproduce the experimental observations upon\nRA removal: the rate of AP axis extension is decreased and small somites form, although the total\nnumber of somites is regulated [43,44]. These facts are consistent with the results of this paper and\nthe \u2018Clock and Wavefront\u2019 model which suggest that removal of RA would slow the progression\nof the FGF8 wavefront, thereby conferring the ability to segment upon fewer cells in each oscil-\nlation of the segmentation clock. One aim for future work is to integrate this system into these\nprevious models for somite formation [41,42] to see if it is indeed capable of mimicking the results.7. Conclusion\nIn summary, the model suggests that introduction of a secondary morphogen, acting in an\nantagonistic manner to a primary morphogen, is able to increase robustness of the primary mor-\nphogen gradient to perturbation and that it also plays a role in determining wave speed and shape.\nThe models and context considered here are excellent paradigms for other scenarios in which mor-\nphogen gradients are known to act and as such, these results have direct application to many other\ndevelopmental systems.Acknowledgments\nR.E.B. wishes thank Lloyds Tercentenary Foundation for a Lloyds Tercentenary Foundation\nFellowship, Research Councils UK for an RCUK Academic Fellowship in Mathematical\nBiology, St. Hugh\u2019s College, Oxford for a Junior Research Fellowship and the Stowers Institute\nfor Medical Research, Kansas City for a visiting position.References\n[1] T.
