It is both a celebration of the \narrival of participation in human geography and related disciplines, and a timely \nreminder that participation itself is inherently spatial: we suggest that geographers \nhave major contributions to make to participatory theory, practice and change. \nParticipatory approaches have been employed for several decades by researchers \nengaging with critical pedagogy and systems thinking within sociology, education, \ncommunity development and environmental management. In the last few years there \nhas been a surge of interest and application in geography, so that participatory \ngeographies have now reached critical mass (see Breitbart, 2003; Kesby et al, 2005; \nKindon, 2005; Kindon et al, in preparation; Pain, 2004; Participatory Geographies \nWorking Group, 2006).  \n \nThe emphasis within geography to date has been on charting some of the distinctive \nbenefits of participatory approaches within particular contexts: new methods, \nknowledges and social change outcomes. Geographers have also begun to engage \ncritically with wider debates about participation, so that there is now a diversification \nof intellectual dialogue which requires closer scrutiny (see for example Cahill, 2004; \n2007; Cameron and Gibson\u2019 2005; Kesby, 2000; 2005; Kindon, 2003; Hickey and \nMohan, 2004; Mohan, 1999; Moser and McIlwaine, 1999; Williams, 2004). \nSurprisingly, however, the specific relations between participation, place and space \nhave received little attention, and this theme issue begins to address this gap (see also \nKindon and Pain, 2006).  \n \nParticipatory research describes a family of approaches wherein those conventionally \n\u2018researched\u2019 are directly involved in some or all stages of research, from problem \ndefinition through to dissemination and action (see Hall, 2005; Kesby et al, 2005; \nKindon, 2005; Pain and Francis, 2003). Ownership of the research is shared with \nparticipants, who negotiate processes with the academic researcher. The approaches \nemphasise social change as a potential valuable outcome of research. Thus \nparticipatory approaches have been heralded as offering opportunities for more \nemancipatory and empowering geographies with transformative development as their \nkey objective.   \n \nThey are gaining in popularity in light of recently voiced concerns about the \nintellectual and practical limits of the cultural turn and the need to \u2018rematerialize\u2019 \nhuman geography (Lees, 2002; Gregson, 2003; Philo, 2000), continuing debates over \nrelevance (Beaumont et al, 2005; Staeheli and Mitchell, 2005; Imrie, 2005), and the \nperceived failure of mainstream qualitative methodologies to affect change beyond \nthe academy (Fuller and Kitchin, 2004; Participatory Geographies Working Group, \n2006).  In particular, critical, feminist and postcolonial social and environmental \ngeographies are being strengthened by this new means of putting principles and \npolitics into action, working with research partners outside the academy in ways \nwhich give equal weight to transformation and knowledge production (see for \nexample Cahill, 2004; Cameron and Gibson, 2005; Kindon, 2003; McIlwaine and \nDatta, 2004; McIntyre, 2000; Peake, 2000).  \n \nAlthough they share some philosophical and ethical tenets, participatory geographies \nhave no strongly formed common identity. While participation is an intrinsically \nspatial practice, and the development of participatory approaches outside of \ngeography has increasingly borrowed spatial terminology and concepts (see Kesby, \n2005; and his paper in this issue), there is still relatively little sense, inside and outside \nthe discipline, of what is distinctive about participatory geographies. As the papers \nthat follow show, participation, space and place are mutually constitutive. Firstly, \nspatial strategies, concepts and methods form central features of participatory theory \nand practice. Secondly, participatory processes in turn influence and constitute space. \nThirdly, participation demands attention to scale: not only because it begins from a \nconcern to prioritise local subjects and concerns and ground-up processes (Chambers, \n1983; Fals-Borda, 2001, Freire, 1972, Maguire, 1987), but because its frameworks of \nunderstanding provide ways of relating local concerns to the personal, the national \nand the global (Cahill, 2004). Its processes provide a means of connecting displaced \nevents and causations at practical and ideological levels through the use of powerful \ntools. These in turn begin to address hierarchical and scalist theorising of social and \nspatial processes (see Marston et al, 2005). Fourthly, several geographers have begun \nto acknowledge that all participatory research is embedded within particular places \nand spaces (see Ellie Jupp in this issue). These contexts are fundamental to how \nparticipation operates, practically and politically, and inform the shape of its \noutcomes. Fifthly, there are connections to be made between other recent areas of \ngeographical theory, such as non-representational theory, and understandings of \nparticipation (Kindon and Pain, 2006). \n \nThe papers which follow arose from the first ever session on participatory \ngeographies, held at the International Geographical Union conference in Glasgow in \n20041. The contributors to this session reflected on varied projects in different parts of \nthe world, highlighting common opportunities, challenges and tensions for \nparticipatory geographies, and new directions for theory, practice and action. They \nraised important questions about the implications of participatory approaches for the \npractice of human geography more widely, the production of disciplinary knowledge \nand the relation of geographers to power in research processes.  \n \nIn Mike Kesby\u2019s paper the emphasis is on retheorising participation from a \ngeographical perspective. He addresses the poststructuralist critiques, led most \nnotably by Cooke and Kothari (2001), which have criticised participation as a \nfundamentally modernist and instrumentalist project, guilty of entrenching rather than \ndestabilising traditional hierarchical relations between researcher and researched. The \nincreasing institutionalisation of participation within much research and policy has \nindeed produced some of the worst excesses of extractive practice. This critique has \nreverberated powerfully throughout the social sciences and become another reason for \nmany academics to abandon or avoid participation as too problematic.  \n \nGeographers have been at the forefront of counter-responses however (see Cameron \nand Gibson, 2005; Hickey and Mohan, 2004; Kesby, 2005; Williams, 2004), and here, \nMike Kesby forwards a constructive and sensitive argument informed by his research \nexperiences on HIV risk and young people in Zimbabwe. He seeks to reconcile \nparticipatory research and post-structuralist critiques, and provides a compelling \ncounter-critique of recent theorisations of power, empowerment, agency and the \nspaces of participation. Rather than be scared off by the problematics raised by \npoststructuralism, or continue to produce tidy accounts of participation that fail to \nacknowledge its complex relationships to power, he argues that we might reach \u2018a \nmore positive reconciliation\u2019, and \u2018deploy (carefully) the resources of participation in \nattempts to effect empowered human agency and facilitate socio-spatial change\u2019.  \n \nParticipatory research involves continually moving between local detail and wider \ntheoretical questions (see Cahill, 2004). In the second paper in this collection, Ellie \nJupp also takes on the issues of knowledge and empowerment by discussing her field \nexperiences of using participatory methods in research on public space with young \npeople in the UK. She gives an honest and uncompromising account of moments of \nawkwardness and silence in her research, and participation which seemingly does not \nlive up to its promises. But she underlines the importance of accepting these moments \nas valid interventions, which led her to open up to forms of knowledge that were less \nabstracted and more embodied and situated. The messiness of participatory research is \ninstructive and is itself informed by spatial contexts and processes. This realisation, is \nmore helpful for other researchers than textbook pretences of a \u2018gold standard\u2019 (Kesby \net al, 2005).  \n \nEllie Jupp\u2019s paper \u2018focuses on moments of failure and difficulties in order to open up, \nrather than close down, how we think about participation in social science research\u2019.  \nShe also views participatory knowledges as performative and located within particular \nsets of social relations, times and places. Knowledge is made through research \nprocesses rather than there being a singular version of the world awaiting detection, \nand participatory research not only allows for, but embraces, multiple realities. \nSceptical views of participation tend to construct it in much narrower terms; Demeritt \n(2005), for example, suggests that participatory geographies have an instrumentalism \nabout them which parallels that of more traditional relationships between academics \nand policy-makers, and that participatory researchers might be engaged in the \nantithesis of blue skies theorising. Yet, as Ellie Jupp demonstrates, participatory \nresearch should be explicitly about the openness, emergence, surprise, tensions and \nirreconcilability that often make up the process of co-researching with non academics.  \n \nFran Klodowsky\u2019s paper focuses on the socio-spatial contexts of participatory \nresearch.  She explores their importance for methodological choices and possibilities \nfor participatory working, particularly in our collaborations with public bodies. With \nreference to two of her projects in Canada, one on homelessness and one on gender \nand diversity, she highlights the challenges of neoliberalism in shaping the spaces in \nwhich research choices and outcomes are made. Rhetoric about partnerships with \ncommunity groups has increased in Canada\u2019s municipal governments as elsewhere, \nand yet the possibilities for genuinely democratic processes are often squeezed. As \nFran Klodowsky notes, things played out very differently on the two projects, as a \ndeeper model of participatory research was embraced in the gender project. She offers \ninsightful reflections on how to judge the role of participatory research in \n\u2018deliberalizing\u2019 space, a concern which occupies many researchers who work between \ncommunity groups, public organisations and the academy.  \n \nWhile both projects were successful in highlighting the concerns and experiences of \nmarginalised groups, she suggests that both could also be viewed as playing to the \ndouble-edged neoliberalist agenda of regulation\/inclusivity. Like Mike Kesby and \nEllie Jupp, she argues strongly that participatory research must be understood as open \nand fluid, its progress shaped by social and political conditions, so that practice \nbecomes \u2018not an abstract ideal but rather about the art of the possible \u2013 understood \nreflexively \u2013 in a variety of venues and spaces\u2019. \n \nTogether, the three papers in this collection present a rich engagement with the \nelements of theory, practice and action in participatory research, as well as their \ninseparability and co-construction.  The papers point to the value and necessity of \nengaging space in discussions and analyses of participatory research, if we are to \ngenerate both processes and outcomes which are sensitive to place, power and \npolitically-sensitive outcomes for participants. \n \nFinally, the commentary from Caitlin Cahill, whose own work has involved a long-\nterm participatory engagement with young womyn from New York city grappling \nwith gentrification and racial stereotyping (Cahill, 2004; 2007), provides further \nconnections between the papers in this collection and wider themes within \nparticipatory theory and practice.  \n \nAfter two decades of participatory work in human geography, we suggest that no \ngeographer can afford to ignore the questions and challenges it poses, just as none can \nafford a completely cavalier attitude to the question of who their research benefits \n(adapted from Parfitt, 2004:540).  The challenge facing us now is to how best \nnegotiate the inherent ambiguities and contradictions of participation within our \npractice, at the same time as opening up spaces for the dissemination of new insights \nand possibilities for transformative knowledge and action.  Specifically, as \nparticipation gains institutional power, we need to consider what (following Williams, \n2004) this power can be made to do. Geographers are in an ideal position to find out. \nAs Mike Kesby concludes in his paper, \u2018if we are really convinced of the importance \nof space to social analysis we must find ways to make the complex tools of critical \nhuman geography accessible to ordinary people in and through participatory praxis so \nthat they can identify the spatial embeddedness of powers affecting their lives [and] \ndevelop critical cartographies and alternative spatial representations as a resource for \nempowerment\u2019.  \n \nAcknowledgements \nWe would like to thank all those who took part in the session on \u2018Participatory social \nand cultural geographies\u2019 at the International Geographical Union conference in \nGlasgow in 2004. \n \nNotes \n1 Sessions on participatory geographies have since been held at the Association of \nAmerican Geographers annual meetings in Denver (2005) and Chicago (2006), the \nRoyal Geographical Society\/Institute of British Geographers annual conferences in \nLondon, UK (2005 and 2006), the Canadian Association of Geographers Conference \nin London, Ontario (2005) and the International Geographical Union conference in \nBrisbane (2006).  \n \n \nReferences \n \nBeaumont J, Loopmans M, Uitermark J, 2005, \u201cPoliticization of research and the \nrelevance of geography: some experiences and reflections for an ongoing debate\u201d \nArea 37(2) 118-126  \n \nBreitbart M, 2003, \u201cParticipatory research\u201d in Key Methods in Geography (eds) \nClifford N, Valentine G (Sage, London) pp 161-78. \n \nCahill C, 2004, \u201cDefying gravity: raising consciousness through collective research\u201d \nChildren\u2019s Geographies 2(2) 273-286 \n \nCahill C, forthcoming 2007 \u201cThe personal is political: developing new subjectivities \nin a participatory action research process\u201d Gender, Place, and Culture, 14(3) \n \nCameron J, Gibson K, 2005, \u201cParticipatory action research in a poststructuralist vein\u201d \nGeoforum 36(3) 315-31 \n \nChambers R, 1983, Rural development: putting the first last (Longman, London) \n \nFals-Borda O, 2001 \u201cParticipatory (Action) Research in Social Theory: Origins and \nChallenges\u201d In Handbook of Action Research: Participative Enquiry and Practice, \n(Eds) Reason P, Bradbury H, (Sage, London), pp27-47 \n \nFreire P, 1972, Pedagogy of the Oppressed (Penguin, Harmondsworth)  \n Fuller D, Kitchin R, 2004, \u201cRadical theory\/critical praxis: academic geography \nbeyond the academy?\u201d In Radical theory, critical praxis: making a difference beyond \nthe academy?
