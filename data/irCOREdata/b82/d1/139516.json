It occurs in any ma-\nterial which possesses a polar point symmetry. This effect\nhas been widely used for thermal radiation detection in ap-\nplications such as fire alarms, intruder detection, and thermal\nimaging. All PY materials are also piezoelectric, so the py-\nroelectric coefficient \u0001PY coef.\u0002, which is usually measured\nat constant stress pT,E, consists of the primary PY coef. at the\nconstant strain pS,E and the secondary PY coef. arising from\nstrain,1\npm\nT,E\n= pm\nS,E + dmkl\nE,\u0001cijkl\nE,\u0001\u0002ij\nT,E\n. \u00011\u0002\nHere, dmkl\nE,\u0001 is the piezoelectric constant, cijkl\nE,\u0001 is the elastic\nstiffness, \u0002ij\nT,E is the thermal expansion coefficient, E is the\nelectric field, and \u0001 is the temperature. Notice the use of\nEinstein summation convention.\nThere has been a number of research on the secondary\nPY coef. over the years.2,3 Particularly, the effect of a sub-\nstrate on PY thin films, arising from thermal expansion mis-\nmatch, has been extensively investigated by various\nresearchers.2,4\u20137 Generally speaking, for perovskite-based\nferroelectric materials, the product term dmkl\nE,\u0001cijkl\nE,\u0001cij\nT,E is much\nsmaller than the primary term pS,E, and hence the effect of\nthis mismatch is limited.4,5\nThe possibility of utilizing secondary PY effect to en-\nhance the total PY coef. was suggested by Newnham et al.8\nand Nan.9 Their works led to the development of various\ncomposites with superior mechanical flexibility accompanied\nby good PY performances.10\u201314 They concluded that in most\ncases due to the small hydrostatic piezoelectric effect, arising\nfrom cancellation between coefficients of opposite signs, the\nenhancement available through the secondary contribution is\nrather limited. We report in this communication more than\n100% enhancement in PY coef., utilizing a 2-2 connectivity\nof PY lead zirconate titanate \u0001PZT\u0002 and elastic laminate con-\nfiguration.\nA symmetrical configuration, where a PY PZT layer\nsandwiched between two elastic layers, or vice versa, was\nadopted to avoid bending \u0001Fig. 1\u0002. From thermodynamics, as\nshown by Nye,1 at constant external electric field, the total\nPY coef. of the system was obtained as \u0001for i , j ,k , l ,m=1.3\u0002\ndDm\nd\u0001\n= pm\nT,E\n\u2212 \u0001dmkl\nE,\u0001\u0002\u0001cijkl\nE,\u0001\u0002\u0005\u0002ijT,E \u2212 dSijd\u0001 \u0006 , \u00012\u0002\nwhere dDm \/d\u0001 is the measured PY coef., dSij is the strain\nexperienced by PY material, and d\u0001 is the temperature\nchange.\nIt is evident from Eq. \u00012\u0002 that the larger the strain the\nnonpyroelectric \u0001NP\u0002 component can exert on the PY com-\nponent and the greater the piezoelectric coefficient of the PY\nmaterial, the bigger the change in the secondary contribution.\nThis leads to the conclusion that stiffer NP material with\ngreater disparity in thermal expansion coefficient \u0001\u0002\u0002 with\nthat of PY and more compliant PY material with high piezo-\nelectric coefficients would be desirable. Hence, stainless\nsteel \u0001St\u0002 was chosen as the NP material and the PZT for the\nPY material.\nExpression \u00012\u0002 is the general PY coef. for any PY mate-\nrial under strain. With the symmetry of PZT in mind, Eq. \u00012\u0002\ncan be simplified further to\np3 = p3\nT,E\n\u2212 d31\nE,\u0001\u0007\nj=1\n3 \u0005\u0001c1jE,\u0001 + c2jE,\u0001\u0002\b\u0002 jT,E \u2212 dSjd\u0001\t\u0006\n\u2212 d33\nE,\u0001\u0007\nj=1\n3 \u0005c3jE,\u0001\b\u0002 jT,E \u2212 dSjd\u0001\t\u0006 . \u00013\u0002\nWhen Eq. \u00013\u0002 is evaluated for a typical PZT, e.g.,\nPZT-5H,15,16 the sums of dmkl\nE,\u0001cijkl\nE,\u0001 terms for each direction,\ni.e., corresponding to dS1 or dS2 and dS3, termed as dc1 or\ndc2, and dc3, are dc1=dc2=\u221215.9 and dc3=16.0 C m\u22122.\nThis implies that positive strains in one and two directions,\na\u0002Electronic mail: z.huang@cranfield.ac.uk.

The best configuration\nfor this requirement is a 2-2 connectivity laminate since,\nwith increasing temperature, it can lead to PZT\u2019s strains in\none and two axes being positive while strain in three axis\nbecomes negative as a consequence of Poisson effect. Plate\ntheory17 and force balance equations were used to elicit the\nstrain that NP can exert on PY. As the system is symmetrical\nabout the 1-2 plane \u0001Fig. 1\u0002, two layer plate theory should\npresent a good approximation to our three layer case. From\ngeneralized Hooke\u2019s law for orthotropic materials17 with the\nassumptions of the Kirchhoff plate conditions,18 i.e., only S1,\nS2, S3, and S6 are nonzero \u0001but T3=T4=T5=0\u0002 and that the\nshear stress in 1-2 plane, i.e., T6=\u000312, is negligible, the total\nstrain experienced by PY can be derived to be\ndPYS1 = dPYS2 =\nY\u00011 \u2212 2s13c13\u0002\u00011 + PY\u0002d\u0001\u0002\u0001NP\u0002 \u2212 PY\u0002\u0002d\u0001\n\u00011 \u2212 \u0004\u0002\u0001c11 + c12\u0002\u00011 + NP\u0002d\u0001\u0002R + Y\u00011 \u2212 2s13c13\u0002\u00011 + PY\u0002d\u0001\u0002\n+ PY\u0002d\u0001\nand dPYS3 =\n2Ys13\u0001c11 + c12\u0002\u00011 + PY\u0002d\u0001\u0002\u0001NP\u0002 \u2212 PY\u0002\u0002d\u0001\n\u00011 \u2212 \u0004\u0002\u0001c11 + c12\u0002\u00011 + NP\u0002d\u0001\u0002R + Y\u00011 \u2212 2s13c13\u0002\u00011 + PY\u0002d\u0001\u0002\n+ PY\u0002d\u0001 , \u00014\u0002\nwhere Y and v are Young\u2019s modulus and Poisson\u2019s ratio of\nNP, respectively, sij is the elastic compliance of PY, and R is\nthe thickness ratio of PY to NP layers. Evaluating the PY\ncoef. in Eq. \u00013\u0002, with Eq. \u00014\u0002 substituted in, leads to the PY\ncoef. of approximately \u22125.0\u000510\u22124\u2212 \u0003\u00016.5\u000510\u22124\u0002 \/ \u00010.32\u0005R\n+1.0\u0002\u0004 C m\u22122 K\u22121.15,16,19\nThe above model assumed that the tertiary PY effect\nwas negligible, the bonding between the layers is perfect,\nand the thickness of the bonding layers can be neglected.\nThe first assumption is reasonable since our experimental\nsetup is designed to provide uniform heating and cooling.\nHowever, due to the finite stiffness and thickness of the\nepoxy bonding layers and other possible bonding defects,\nsome loss in the transfer of strains between the St and the\nPZT layer is expected. Therefore, we define an interface cou-\npling factor k, similar to that of Bichurin et al.,20 resulting in\nthe PY coef. of \u22125.0\u000510\u22124\u2212 \u0003\u00016.5\u000510\u22124\u0005k\u0002 \/ \u00010.32\u0005R\n+1.0\u0002\u0004C m\u22122 K\u22121, with k=1 represent perfect bonding and\nk=0 no bonding at all. Setting R to approach infinity, which\nis equivalent to no St layer being present, the PY coef. con-\nverges to \u22125.0\u000510\u22124, namely, pm\nT,E of a bare PZT-5H. With\nR approaching zero, which is the case for infinitely thick St\nlayer or thin PZT layer, the PY coef. converges to its maxi-\nmum value as the PY coef. of a typical PZT is not dependent\non its thickness, while smaller R leads to larger extra strain\ncaused by St in the PZT layer.\nThe PY coef. was measured three times for each PZT\nsample. The first measurement on the bare PZT was followed\nby yet to be bonded St\/PZT\/St stack and the final measure-\nment on the epoxy bonded St\/PZT\/St lamina of that exact\nstack. This ensured that the only parameter being altered\nbetween the observations before and after bonding was the\nintroduction of epoxy bonding. The bare PZT\u2019s PY coef. was\nfound to be the same as nonbonded St\/PZT\/St stack, and the\nbonded samples were fabricated by applying a well-known\ncommercial epoxy \u0001EPOTEK 301-2, Epoxy Technology,\nInc.\u0002 onto the surface of each St laminate and placing the\nPZT between the two, after which the sample was cured at\n100 \u00b0C in an oven.\nThe measured PY coef. enhancement and their theoreti-\ncal values for the bonded St\/PZT\/St lamina at different\nPZT\/St thickness ratios R are illustrated in Figs. 2 and 3. For\nthe sample with R=2.67 \u0001267 \u0006m PZT-5H with 100 \u0006m St\u0002,\nthe enhanced PY coef. was observed to be \u22126.7\u000510\u22124 com-\npared to \u22124.1\u000510\u22124 C m\u22122 K\u22121 before the bonding. When\nR=0.254 \u0001127 \u0006m PZT-5H with 500 \u0006m St\u0002, this rose to\n\u22129.0\u000510\u22124 from \u22124.8\u000510\u22124 C m\u22122 K\u22121 before the bonding.\nThis represents a PY coef. enhancement of 4.2\n\u000510\u22124 C m\u22122 K\u22121 \u0001around 90%\u0002. It is evident from Figs. 2\nand 3 that there is a good agreement between the theoretical\nand experimental values when k=0.75, which suggests that\nthe average loss of strain due to interfacial coupling is\naround 25%. This also implies that there is still a substantial\nimprovement that can be made for our already large en-\nhancement by further perfecting the interfacial bonding.\nWhen the PZTs were exchanged to PZT-5A, for the same\nR=0.254, the bonded stack exhibited PY coef. enhancement\nFIG. 2.
