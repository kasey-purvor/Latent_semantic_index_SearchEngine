However, the cellular mechanisms involved in catecholamine-induced cardiac hypertrophy, particularly Ca2+ handling, are largely unknown. We therefore investigated the effects of cardiac hypertrophy, produced by isoprenaline, on INa\/Ca and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) function in isolated myocytes. Methods: INa\/Ca was studied in myocytes from Wistar rats, using descending (+80 to \u00bf110 mV) voltage ramps under steady state conditions. Myocytes were also loaded with fura-2 and either field stimulated or voltage clamped to assess [Ca2+]i and SR Ca2+ content. Results: Ca2+-dependent, steady state INa\/Ca density was increased in hypertrophied myocytes (P<0.05). Ca2+ release from the SR was also increased, whereas resting [Ca2+]i and the rate of decline of [Ca2+]i to control levels were unchanged. SR Ca2+ content, estimated by using 10.0 mmol\/l caffeine, was also significantly increased in hypertrophied myocytes, but only when myocytes were held and stimulated from their normal resting potential (\u00bf80 mV) but not from \u00bf40 mV. However, the rate of decline of caffeine-induced Ca2+ transients or INa\/Ca was not significantly different between control and hypertrophied myocytes. Ca2+-dependence of INa\/Ca, examined by comparing the slope of the descending phase of the hysteresis plots of INa\/Ca vs. [Ca2+]i, was also similar in the two groups of cells.
