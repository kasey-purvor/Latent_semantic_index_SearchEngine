Introduction \nAtmospheric aerosol plays an important role both in global biogeochemical cycles as well \nas in the climate system of the Earth. Long-range aerosol transport enables the export of \nnutrients to and across the oceans, the latter being crucial for the bioproductivity in \nremote regions [Boyd and others, 2000; Falkowski et al., 2000; Martin, 1990; Swap et al., \n1992; Watson et al., 2000]. Aerosols also affect the radiative balance of the Earth [Tegen \net al., 1996] directly by scattering or absorption of incoming short wave radiation and \nindirectly by acting as cloud condensation nuclei, amplifying a temperature effect at the \nsurface due to changes in cloud cover [IPCC, 2001]. In addition, aerosol particles are \nintimately coupled to atmospheric chemistry as chemical reactions in the atmosphere are \noften accelerated on aerosol surfaces [Dentener et al., 1996] providing water, oxidants \nand\/or catalysts. \n \nBesides this active role in the Earth system, sea salt and mineral dust aerosol, which are \nconservatively archived in polar ice cores, represent passive tracers which can be used to \nFISCHER ET AL., DUST AND SEA SALT IN POLAR ICE CORES \n2 \nreconstruct climate conditions in their source regions as well as large-scale atmospheric \ntransport patterns. The life cycle of an aerosol particle starts with its formation. In the \ncase of sea salt, aerosol production is caused by wind dispersion of sea water in liquid \nand frozen state. Dispersion of wave crests and the bursting of small air bubbles at the \nocean surface producing small droplets [Monahan, 1986] represent an efficient way of \nproducing sea salt particles, which may be uplifted by convective cells in the boundary \nlayer. In high latitudes sea salt aerosol additionally derives from the sea ice surface. For \nexample, frost flowers, which form during the refreezing of open leads and polynyas \nwithin the sea ice cover, allow for the entrainment of sea salt particles into the \natmosphere [Rankin et al., 2000; Wagenbach et al., 1998]. In the case of mineral dust, \nchemical and physical weathering of crustal material leads to the formation of small dust \nparticles which may get entrained into the air during high surface winds. Larger particles \nmay be horizontally accelerated by surface wind and collide with other particles, an \navalanche process called saltation [Marticorena and Bergametti, 1995]. The impact is \nable to provide vertical momentum to the smaller particles and leads to entrainment into \nthe boundary layer and subsequently efficient uplift by convection.  \n \nThe sea salt and mineral dust load in the atmosphere is strongly influenced by the climate \nconditions in the source region and aerosol records provide information e.g. on cyclonic \nactivity, wind speeds and, in the case of dust, on soil properties such as aridity [Genthon, \n1992] or vegetation cover. In the case of the mineral dust sources, which are located in \narid and semiarid regions in both hemispheres far away from the polar ice sheets \n[Prospero et al., 2002], dust storm events provide the energy to lift dust particles to the \nhigh troposphere above the cloud level, where their atmospheric lifetime is large enough \nto survive long-range transport [Gong et al., 2003; Prospero et al., 2002; Sun, 2002; \nTegen, 2003]. Sea salt aerosol formation is closely linked to cyclonic activity, providing \nhigh wind speeds on the ocean surface for efficient sea salt aerosol formation. Sea salt \naerosol is then also efficiently transported and mainly wet deposited along the storm track \n[Fischer and Mieding, 2005; Fischer et al., 2004]. It follows that sea salt and snow \ndeposition are closely linked in regions of ice sheets where intrusions of marine air \nmasses and frontal precipitation occur. \n \nThe long-range transported aerosol is wet and dry deposited onto the ice sheets, where a \nstratigraphically ordered sequence of precipitation and aerosol deposition events is \nformed. Accordingly, ice core records retrieved from the polar ice sheets on both \nhemispheres (Fig. 1), provide aerosol records in high (in some cases seasonal) resolution \nover the last glacial\/interglacial cycles. The major feature of these records is a 1-2 orders \nof magnitude increase in sea salt aerosol and mineral dust concentration during glacial \nperiods. The reasons for this change have still not been quantitatively explained and may \nbe sought in the three steps of the aerosol life cycle: production, transport and deposition \nor any combination of the three. Accordingly, different hypotheses have been put forward \nin the literature based on observational, theoretical and modeling evidence to explain the \ndocumented changes. In this study we will summarize the observational and modeling \nevidence, discuss the different hypotheses and try to come up with a synthesis and \nexplanation of the glacial\/interglacial changes in sea salt and mineral dust concentrations \nin ice cores. \nFISCHER ET AL., DUST AND SEA SALT IN POLAR ICE CORES \n3 \n \nThis review is organized in 5 sections. In section 2 the results concerning sea salt and \nmineral dust records from major ice core projects in Greenland and Antarctica are \nsummarized. That section presents the database which has to be explained in terms of \nchanges in the geochemical aerosol cycles over glacial\/interglacial timescales. We \nintentionally restrict the discussion to a few ice cores representative for the two major ice \nsheets, because those are distal to any local aerosol sources and, therefore, are most likely \nto archive changes in background aerosol concentrations for each hemisphere. Valuable \ninformation on dust emissions may also be derived from tropical ice core records \n[Thompson et al., 1998; Thompson et al., 1995; Thompson et al., 1997], however, those \ncores reflect mainly local conditions of dust generation, uplift and transport. Section 3 \ndiscusses the contribution of processes which may have led to the observed long-term \nchanges based on ice core evidence and theoretical considerations. In sections 3.1-3.3 \npossible changes in the three stages of an aerosol lifetime are individually discussed. \nBecause the understanding of aerosol deposition is a fundamental prerequisite for the \ninterpretation of ice core records, we will discuss the individual processes in reverse \norder of the aerosol life cycle, i.e. starting with the deposition of aerosol on the ice sheets \nin section 3.1. Then we will quantify transport changes in section 3.2 and finally we \ndiscuss potential emission changes in section 3.3, where uncertainties are still large \nbecause quantitative observational evidence is sparse. In section 4 we tackle this question \nfrom a different direction by contrasting the observational evidence in section 3 with a \nsummary of the current state-of-the-art in global modeling of aerosol emission and \ntransport. This may give additional insight into the potential of individual processes to \ncontribute to the glacial\/interglacial aerosol changes but will also show the limitations of \naerosol modeling which still exist to date. In the final section 5 we attempt a quantitative \nsynthesis of the state-of-the-art of our knowledge on sea salt and mineral dust aerosol \nchanges as recorded in ice cores as summarized in Table 2, we point out gaps in our \nknowledge and suggest future directions in ice core and modeling studies to fill those \ngaps. \n \n2. Continuous aerosol records in Greenland and Antarctica \n2. 1 Methods and uncertainties \nSea salt and mineral dust aerosol are transported onto the polar ice sheets, where they are \narchived by wet and dry deposition. Using snow and ice core samples, concentrations and \nsize distributions of particulate dust can be determined using particle counting techniques \n[Delmonte et al., 2002; Petit et al., 1990; Ram and Koenig, 1997; Ruth et al., 2003; \nSteffensen, 1985]. Specific soluble dust tracers (e.g. Ca2+) or insoluble elements \ncontained in particulate dust (e.g. Al, Fe) as well as ionic species derived from sea salt \n(mainly Na+ and Cl-) are also conveniently used to quantify aerosol changes. Ionic and \nelemental concentrations are determined e.g. by ion chromatography (IC), atomic \nabsorption spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry or continuous \nflow analyses (CFA) [Boutron, 1979; Fischer and Wagenbach, 1996; Fuhrer, 1993; \nGabrielli et al., 2005; Mayewski et al., 1987; R\u00f6thlisberger et al., 2000; Steffensen, \n1988]. A detailed description of these analytical techniques, handling of ultraclean ice \ncore samples and the systematic and stochastic error of such measurements is beyond the \nscope of this paper. Here we will mainly focus on soluble species representing sea salt \nFISCHER ET AL., DUST AND SEA SALT IN POLAR ICE CORES \n4 \n(Na+) and mineral dust (Ca2+) aerosol which can be determined by IC and CFA with an \nerror typically better than 10% for concentrations above the blank level (typically a few \nppb) and where the available database to date is better than for other dust indicators. \nNote, that Ca2+ is in principle only representative of part of the overall dust content in the \nice, but by and large both particulate dust and the soluble dust proxy Ca2+ reveal the same \npicture of paleoclimatic changes in the dust cycle. A recent comparison of soluble Ca2+ \nwith the total Ca2+ concentration derived by complete acid digestion of ice core samples \nfrom Dome C, Antarctica, showed that the soluble Ca2+ amount varied between 80-90 % \nof the total Ca2+ level for glacial and interglacial samples (Gaspari, personal \ncommunication). This variability is much lower than the glacial\/interglacial variability \nfound in the ice cores and can therefore be neglected to first order.  \n \nAerosol deposition fluxes are derived by multiplying ice core concentrations by the \nannual snow accumulation rate. In general accumulation rates are reduced during cold \nclimate conditions, resulting in smaller glacial\/interglacial variations in estimated fluxes \nthan in measured concentrations. Snow accumulation rates can be determined at high \nresolution sites by counting annual layers for example in high-resolution CFA profiles \nand destraining the layers, which have been subject to downcore thinning due to glacier \nflow, using an ice flow model [Cuffey and Clow, 1997]. In low accumulation areas as \nlargely encountered in the interior of East Antarctica, individual annual layers cannot be \nresolved. Here the accumulation rate is usually estimated from temperature \nreconstructions derived from the stable water isotope composition (\u03b418O or \u03b4D). In short, \nthe accumulation is assumed to be thermodynamically controlled by the change in \nsaturation water vapor pressure which is a function of temperature ([EPICA community \nmembers, 2004], supplemental material, [Schwander et al., 2001]). The error of such \naccumulation rates can be estimated to be 20-30%. Accordingly, the error in aerosol \nfluxes is about 30%. Although considerable, this uncertainty is still small compared to the \nchanges in sea salt and dust encountered on millennial time scales in the glacial and \nduring glacial\/interglacial transitions. Accordingly, analytical limitations generally do not \naffect the conclusions drawn in this study. \n \n2.2 Sea salt and mineral dust budget in both polar regions \nAverage concentrations in Greenland and Antarctica reflect the different setting of the \nEarth\u2019s two major ice sheets. Antarctica is surrounded by the Southern Ocean as reflected \nby much higher sea salt concentrations and fluxes compared to mineral dust. For recent \nconditions the number of Na+ molecules per kg of ice in Antarctica is a factor of 25 \nhigher than that for Ca2+ [Petit et al., 1999; Wolff et al., 2005] while in Greenland it is \nonly twice as high. In the LGM the number of Na+ molecules per kg ice is still about 4 \ntimes higher than that for Ca2+ in Antarctica [Petit et al., 1999; Wolff et al., 2005], while \nit is even a factor of two lower in Greenland [Mayewski et al., 1994], reflecting the \nrelatively higher influence of continental aerosol in Greenland. Also the temporal \nevolution of mineral dust and sea salt aerosol is quite different for both polar regions and \nreflects the different climate evolution in the northern and southern hemisphere as \ndocumented in ice core aerosol records from Greenland and Antarctica (e.g. Dye 3 \n[Hammer et al., 1985], GRIP [de Angelis, 1997; Fuhrer et al., 1999], GISP2 [Mayewski \net al., 1997; Mayewski et al., 1994; Taylor, 1997], Renland [Hansson, 1994], Vostok [de \nFISCHER ET AL., DUST AND SEA SALT IN POLAR ICE CORES \n5 \nAngelis, 1992; Petit et al., 1999], Taylor Dome [Mayewski et al., 1996], EPICA Dome C, \n[R\u00f6thlisberger et al., 2002; Wolff et al., 2005])  \n \nAlthough measured Na+ and Ca2+ concentrations can generally be taken as sea salt and \ndust tracers, respectively, a crustal contribution to Na+ may be possible and some Ca2+ is \nderived from sea water. This has to be considered, e.g. when performing correlation \nanalyses between the two records (section 3.2), and can in principle be corrected for \nusing average Na+\/Ca2+ ratios in sea water and crustal material. For Greenland, the Cl-\n\/Na+ ratio in the ice cores is very close to the sea water ratio during glacial times \n[Mayewski et al., 1997; Mayewski et al., 1994] and during the Holocene a Cl- excess \nprevails, which has been related to the longer atmospheric lifetime of gaseous HCl \nreleased from sea salt aerosol [Legrand et al., 2002; Legrand and Delmas, 1988] in an \nacidic atmosphere. This indicates that - with the exception of particular dust events - Na+ \nis essentially of sea salt origin in Greenland. The sea salt contribution to Ca2+ estimated \nusing the sea water Ca2+\/Na+ ratio is only around 10% during the Holocene and much \nlower during glacial times. Therefore, we refrain from correcting Na+ and Ca2+ \nconcentrations in Greenland for their crustal and sea salt contributions, respectively.  \n \nOn the East Antarctic plateau the sea water contribution to Ca2+ is high for the Holocene \n(around 50%) while crustal Na+ becomes important during the glacial (20-30% of the \ntotal Na+ concentration). In that case non sea salt Ca2+ (nssCa2+) and sea salt Na+ (ssNa+) \ncan be estimated [R\u00f6thlisberger et al., 2002] according to  \n)NaCa(nssCa 22 +++ \u2212\u2212= mmt\nt R\nRR\nR  \nand \n)NaCa(1NassNa 2 ++++ \u2212\u2212\u2212= mmt\nR\nRR\n \nwith Rm=0.038 (in mass concentration units) being the Ca2+\/Na+ sea water ratio, which is \nwell defined globally. Rt\u22481.78 [Bowen, 1979] represents the crustal ratio, which varies \nover a wide range, dependent on the composition of crustal material as well as on size \ndependent fractionation processes of different minerals during the formation of mineral \ndust aerosol. In addition the composition of crustal tracers as recorded in ionic ice core \ndata may differ from Rt which is based on the total elemental composition of crustal \nmaterial. While the effect of such a variability in Rt changes the nssCa2+ estimate only by \na few percent, its effect on ssNa+ is considerable. For instance reducing Rt within \nreasonable bounds to 1.1 [Bigler et al., 2005] or increasing it to 3.5 changes the ssNa+ \nestimate by 10-30% for glacial conditions in Antarctica.  \n \n2.3 Temporal changes over the last glacial cycles \nIn Fig. 2 the Na+ and Ca2+ record of the Greenland Ice Sheet Program 2 (GISP2) ice core \n[Mayewski et al., 1994] is shown, together with \u03b418O [Grootes et al., 1993] taken as \nrepresentative for climate changes at least in the northern Atlantic region [Bond et al., \n1993; McManus et al., 1999; Porter and An, 1995; Schulz, 1998]. As illustrated in Fig. 2 \nboth sea salt (Na+) and mineral dust (Ca2+) are strongly anticorrelated with Greenland \ntemperature changes, including rapid climate changes such as the warming at the end of \nFISCHER ET AL., DUST AND SEA SALT IN POLAR ICE CORES \n6 \nthe Younger Dryas [Dansgaard et al., 1989; Taylor, 1997] or each individual Dansgaard \nOeschger (DO) event [Fuhrer et al., 1999; Grootes et al., 1993; Johnsen et al., 1992; \nMayewski et al., 1994]. Na+ concentrations during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) are \non average 10-15 times higher than during the Holocene, while Ca2+ was increased by a \nfactor of approximately 80. Extreme steps in aerosol concentrations are encountered at \nthe end of the Younger Dryas (YD) to the Preboreal (PB) where Na+ and Ca2+ \nconcentrations drop in only a few decades by a factor of about 4 and 8, respectively. \nTaking the concurrent change in snow accumulation [Cuffey and Clow, 1997; Meese et \nal., 1994] into account, deposition fluxes in the LGM (see Fig. 6) were a factor of 3-4 and \n15-20 higher than during the Holocene for Na+ and Ca2+, respectively. For the shift from \nthe YD to the PB this leads to a decline in fluxes by a factor of approximately 2 and 4, \nrespectively. A similar instantaneous response holds for the DO events during Marine \nIsotope Stage (MIS) 3. Here, sea salt concentrations decrease rapidly from cold stadials \n(S) to warm interstadials (IS) by a factor of 4-5 and mineral dust by a factor of 15-20. \nFluxes change at the same time by a factor of 2-3 and 6-10 for sea salt and dust, \nrespectively. \n \nIn principle a similar picture emerges for the changes in aerosol concentration in \nAntarctica with higher concentrations during cold and lower concentrations during warm \nperiods. For example, from the LGM to the Holocene, Na+ concentrations in the Vostok \nrecord [Petit et al., 1999] decrease by about a factor of 4 and particulate dust \nconcentrations by a factor of 30-35 (Fig. 3). Although rapid climate changes are not \nencountered in the southern hemisphere, high resolution chemistry records from the \nEPICA Dome C (EDC) ice core [R\u00f6thlisberger et al., 2002; Wolff et al., 2005] show that \nmore gradual variations in Ca2+ concentrations are found on a millennial time scale. As \nshown in Fig. 7 the Antarctic warm event A1, (representing the Antarctic counterpart to \nDO event 8, [Blunier et al., 1998; Broecker, 1998; Knutti et al., 2004; Stocker and \nJohnsen, 2003]) was accompanied by a decline in dust to close to Holocene levels, while \nthe temperature proxy \u03b4D rose by about 15\u2030 in Fig 7 (equivalent to a surface \ntemperature change in Antarctica of 2-2.5 \u00b0C) [R\u00f6thlisberger et al., 2002; Stenni et al., \n2001]. In contrast, sea salt concentrations were only weakly affected by this warm event. \nVice versa, the Antarctic Cold Reversal (ACR in Fig. 7) is only weakly seen in the dust \nrecord but clearly imprinted in the sea salt record. Accordingly, different causes may lead \nto the changes in the aerosol budget over the Antarctic ice sheet for both events. The \ndecrease in snow accumulation in Antarctica during the glacial compared to the \ninterglacial [Schwander et al., 2001] leads to a reduced change in deposition flux for both \naerosol components (Fig. 7) [R\u00f6thlisberger et al., 2002]. Over the last glacial\/interglacial \ntransition the Na+ flux decreases by a factor of approximately 2.5 while the Ca2+ flux \ndecreases by a factor of 10-15 compared to a factor of 25-30 for Ca2+ concentrations.  \n \nOn a longer time scale the Vostok record [Petit et al., 1999] shows that dust and sea salt \nvaried within rather well constrained glacial\/interglacial bounds over the last 4 glacial \ncycles (Fig. 3). With the new sea salt and dust records from the EPICA Dome C ice core \n[Wolff et al., 2005] this view can be extended over the four previous glacial cycles (Fig. \n4), which are characterized by significantly lower glacial\/interglacial temperature \namplitudes in the Southern Ocean region [EPICA community members, 2004]. The \nFISCHER ET AL., DUST AND SEA SALT IN POLAR ICE CORES \n7 \nglacial\/interglacial amplitudes in aerosol fluxes are smaller for the time period 400,000-\n800,000 years BP but the relationship of aerosol fluxes and Southern Ocean temperature \nchanges remains essentially the same (Fig. 5). Especially the early interglacials are \ncharacterized by higher aerosol fluxes. During the first four glacial cycles (800-400 kyrs \nB.P.) in Fig. 5a there is a tendency to somewhat higher dust fluxes for comparable \u03b4D \nvalues than in the last four glacial cycles [Wolff et al., 2005]. In the case of sea salt fluxes \na rather linear relationship with \u03b4D is revealed (Fig. 5b) indicating a very close \nrelationship of Southern Ocean sea salt sources and temperature (see also 3.3).  \n \n3. Ice core evidence of deposition, transport and emission changes \n3.1. Local deposition changes  \nTheoretical considerations \nSea salt and mineral dust aerosol is transferred from the air to the ice sheet surface by wet \nand dry deposition. Accordingly, any temporal change in the deposition processes may \nalso lead to a change in ice core concentrations and fluxes even if atmospheric \nconcentrations were to stay constant. While dry deposition is independent of \nprecipitation, wet deposition is proportional to the snow accumulation. Because the \naverage snow accumulation A has changed between cold and warm climate periods, so \nhas the aerosol deposition rate. In a simplified model the total deposition flux to the ice \nsurface Jice=Cice A averaged over long periods can be written as [Fischer et al., 1998a]  \nairairdrywetdryice ACCvJJJ \u03b5+=+=   (1) \nand therefore the average ice concentration Cice \nairair\ndry\nice CCA\nv\nC \u03b5+=     (2) \nwhere vdry is the effective dry deposition velocity, \u03b5 the effective scavenging efficiency \nincluding in cloud and below cloud scavenging. These equations imply that in regions \nwhere wet deposition provides significant parts of the total deposition the total aerosol \ndeposition becomes smaller in times of lower snow accumulation rates; even if all other \nparameters were to remain constant. Effectively, this implies that the deposition flux \nunderestimates the changes in atmospheric concentration Cair overlying the ice sheet. On \nthe contrary Cice is linearly coupled to the inverse accumulation rate and overestimates \nthe change in Cair.  \n \nAerosol deposition in Greenland \nGreenland snow accumulation rates have been reconstructed over the last 50,000 years \nusing the GISP2 counted depth scale [Alley et al., 1993; Meese et al., 1994] and \ndestraining the counted annual layers, which are thinned by glacier flow. The thinning \nfunction has been determined using a glaciological flow model for three different \nscenarios of ice margin retreat [Cuffey and Clow, 1997]. Here we use the medium \nscenario, invoking a retreat of the ice sheet margin by 100 km, however, the choice of the \nscenario has only an effect of a few percent on the estimated snow accumulation and does \nnot affect our conclusions. Fig. 6 shows that the snow accumulation rate during the LGM \nwas only about 25% of the Holocene value and accumulation rates during interstadial \nevents were about 50 % of the Holocene or twice the LGM value. Accordingly, the \namplitude of flux changes of sea salt and mineral dust onto the ice is smaller than that of \nFISCHER ET AL., DUST AND SEA SALT IN POLAR ICE CORES \n8 \nconcentration changes in the ice. Nevertheless, fluxes and concentration are both strongly \nincreased for cold periods, which cannot be explained by changes in the deposition \nefficiency over the ice sheet. \n \nUsing the equations above, Alley et al. [1995] estimated the change in Cair for different \naerosol species using the joint information of the slope and y-intercept in the linear \nrelationship between total fluxes and snow accumulation for the Younger Dryas (YD) to \npreboreal period (PB) in the GISP2 record. Using this analysis they arrive at 3 times \nhigher air concentrations over Greenland for sea salt (here Cl-) and 7 times higher air \nconcentrations for Ca2+ during the YD compared to the PB. These values lie between the \nchanges derived directly from flux and concentration records in the ice and imply that \nfluxes underestimate the change in true atmospheric concentration in central Greenland \nby a factor of 1.5-2, while concentrations overestimate it by only 10-30% for these \nspecies. In any case, local deposition changes can neither explain the substantial changes \nin concentrations nor in fluxes over the last glacial cycle. Following the modest \noverestimation as supported by the results of Alley et al. [1995] we will discuss ice \nconcentration, when we are interested in air concentrations over the Greenland ice sheet. \n \nAerosol deposition in Antarctica \nFor East Antarctic ice core drill sites such as Vostok or the EPICA drill site at Dome C \n(EDC) the data are easier to interpret. Here recent accumulation rates are as low as 2-3 \ncm water equivalent (WE)\/yr . Convective frontal precipitation events are unlikely and \nclear sky precipitation (diamond dust) prevails. Thus, dry deposition dominates the \ntransfer of aerosol to the ice surface under recent conditions and even more so for the \nlower accumulation rates encountered during glacial periods [Legrand, 1987]. Recent \nstudies on aerosol distribution in ice cores from the plateau area in Dronning Maud Land, \nAntarctica, where accumulation rates are 2-3 times higher than at EDC, revealed that \nabout 75 % of the sulfate aerosol is dry-deposited [G\u00f6ktas et al., 2002]. A similar \ncontribution should also apply for dust aerosol, showing that dry deposition dominates \neven in this area. For EDC this implies that the wet deposition term on the right hand side \nof equation (1) can be neglected to first order and conventionally the total deposition flux \nis taken as a measure of the atmospheric aerosol concentration overlying the East \nAntarctic plateau [Wolff et al., 2005]. For the EDC core, accumulation rates were derived \nfrom the \u03b4D record, representing the temperature of snow formation at the cloud level \n(see Schwander et al. [2001] and supplemental material in EPICA community members \n[2004]). Sea salt and mineral dust species have been measured on the EDC ice core over \nthe last 45,000 years at high resolution using CFA [R\u00f6thlisberger et al., 2000] (Fig 7) and \nat lower resolution over the last 800,000 years by IC [Wolff et al., 2005]. As was the case \nfor Greenland, both fluxes as well as concentrations change in accord, showing that the \nstrong glacial\/interglacial changes in both parameters cannot be explained by local \ndeposition effects. In contrast to Greenland, however, the changes in fluxes can be taken \nas representative of changes in air concentration while the ice concentration changes \noverestimate the total glacial\/interglacial change in air concentration by up to 60% for sea \nsalt and 130% for mineral dust. In the following we will discuss Antarctic flux records \nwhen we are interested in atmospheric aerosol concentrations over the East Antarctic \nplateau. \nFISCHER ET AL., DUST AND SEA SALT IN POLAR ICE CORES \n9 \n \n3.2.Transport \nAs illustrated in Figures 2-7, sea salt and mineral dust show a high covariance both on \nglacial\/interglacial and in part also on millennial time scales during the glacial. The latter \nis exceptionally pronounced in Greenland. In principle there are two possible \nexplanations for these common variations: \na) The source strength of both aerosol species reacts to climate changes in a \ncomparable way. \nb) The overall transport by intensified large-scale circulation patterns leads to a \ncovariation of both aerosol components due to changes in transport time and\/or \natmospheric lifetime. \nBased on an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis performed on the ion records \nof the GISP2 ice core Mayewski et al. [1997] and Mayewski et al. [1994] concluded that \nthe high correlation of sea salt and mineral dust ions is due to common transport of both \naerosol components to Greenland. The time series of the first EOF of normalized Cl-, \nSO42-, Na+, K+, Mg2+ and Ca2+ concentrations, explaining 91% of the total variance, \nresembles very closely the Ca2+ and Na+ record and was termed the Polar Circulation \nIndex (PCI) [Mayewski et al., 1994].  \n \nHowever, the EOF analysis intrinsically reflects only the linear component of the \ncovariance of each aerosol series with the principal component of EOF1 and, thus, only \nthe linear component of the covariance between the different series. If Na+ and Ca2+ \nconcentrations are compared in a scatter plot e.g. for MIS3 (Fig. 8a), where most of the \nvariance is induced by the DO events, it is evident that such a linear relationship does not \nstrictly hold. Instead the coupling of both species can be better described by a power law \n[Siggaard-Andersen et al., 2005]. The question arises whether such a relationship can be \nexplained by aerosol transport to the ice sheet. In a first order approximation the change \nin aerosol concentration of an air parcel along its trajectory can be written as \n\u03c4\nt\nairair eCtC\n\u2212=  )0()(     (3) \nwhere t is the transport time, \u03c4 the atmospheric aerosol lifetime and Cair(0) the air \nconcentration at the source [Hansson, 1994]. If we consider two aerosol species (e.g. Na+ \nand Ca2+) equation (3) leads to \n  (0)(0) 22 CaCaNaNa\n\u03b1\u03b1\n  C C CC ++++\n\u2212=     (4) \nand in logarithmic form \n++++ += 22 log(0)log (0)loglog CaNaNa CaCC-CC \u03b1\u03b1   (5). \n++\n++=\nNa\nCa\n \nwith \n2\n2\n\u03c4\n\u03c4\u03b1\nCa\nNa\nt\nt\n . \nFrom equations (4) and (5) it follows that if both species were subject to a covariant \nchange in transport time t or in atmospheric life time \u03c4 (i.e. \u03b1=const) a power law \ndependence of Na+ and Ca2+ concentrations, implying a linear relationship in logarithmic \nFISCHER ET AL., DUST AND SEA SALT IN POLAR ICE CORES \n10 \nconcentrations, would be expected [Siggaard-Andersen et al., 2005]. Such a covariant \nchange in tNa+ and tCa2+ could be caused by a general hemispheric intensification of \ntransport, however, changes in long-range transport of dust from Asian desert areas to the \nGreenland ice sheet and meridional transport of sea salt related to cyclonic activity in the \nNorth Atlantic may have been uncoupled. A common scaling of \u03c4Na+ and \u03c4Ca2+ can be \nexpected from an overall hemispheric reduction of precipitation, thus wet deposition \nalong the transport routes of dust and sea salt. Again a reduction of wet deposition in the \npast may not necessarily have been the same for the different transport routes of sea salt \nand dust. Note, that a coupling of sea salt and mineral dust aerosol by transport does not \nhold for individual precipitation events, because variability in transport time and aerosol \nscavenging for individual trajectories is very large. However ice core aerosol records \nwith decadal or even centennial resolution integrate over many precipitation events and \nefficiently average this variability out. Accordingly, ice core data are able to record \nchanges of the average transport of aerosol to the ice sheets only. \n \nAn independent change in the source strengths (CNa+(0), CCa2+(0)) of one or both species \nor a completely decoupled transport of dust and sea salt to the Greenland ice sheet would \ndestroy a linear relationship in equation (5). Only if the source strengths of both species \nare correlated could a power law relationship be also caused by changes in emissions. For \nsea salt and mineral dust where the climate conditions at the sources are distinct this \nappears not to be likely but cannot be excluded per se. Accordingly, the existence of a \npower law relationship between mineral dust and sea salt species is expected if covariant \ntransport changes occurred, however a coupled source effect for sea salt and dust could \nalso explain a high covariance. In the following we will study what potential implications \nequation (5) has for the interpretation of aerosol ice core records in terms of transport \nchanges.  \n \nWhen switching from one climate state to the other (e.g. going from the LGM to the \nHolocene or from stadials to interstadials) circulation patterns transporting mineral dust \nand sea salt to the ice sheets as well as precipitation rates leading to wet deposition en \nroute may change and potentially lead to a change of \u03b1 (in equations (4) and (5)). In that \ncase no clear linear coupling of logarithmic sea salt and dust concentrations can be \nexpected. Indeed, in the scatter plot in Fig. 8b, different linear relationships, and thus \ndifferent \u03b1\u2019s are observed for cold stadials and warm interstadials (here separated \naccording to Ca2+ > 100 ppb and Ca2+ < 100 ppb, respectively) as has also been observed \nin scatter plots for Ca2+ vs. isotope temperature [Fuhrer et al., 1999]. \n \nUsing 2-dimensional linear regression analysis the following linear fits can be derived for \nthe individual groups in Fig. 8b: \nStadials (S):  0.58r  ; ppb) \/1log( 51.052.0)ppb 1\/log( 2Na 2 =+= ++ CaCC  \nInterstadials (IS):  0.52r  ; ppb) \/1log( 90.010.0)ppb 1\/log( 2Na 2 =+\u2212= ++ CaCC  \nAccording to equation (5) these regressions imply that 50-60% of the variance in Na+ and \nCa2+ records could be explained by a common transport effect within stadials and \ninterstadials, respectively. Alternatively, dust and sea salt sources may have responded to \nFISCHER ET AL., DUST AND SEA SALT IN POLAR ICE CORES \n11 \nclimate changes in a similar way during both stadials and interstadials. A linear \nrelationship can be also derived for the Holocene concentrations (not shown) with: \nHolocene:   0.18r  ; ppb) \/1log( 95.012.0)ppb 1\/log( 2Na 2 =+\u2212= ++ CaCC  \nInterestingly, the linear regression parameters for the Holocene are identical to the \ninterstadial values, suggesting that atmospheric aerosol transport was not significantly \ndifferent for interstadial events and the Holocene. Note, however, that the Holocene \nlinear relation explains only 18% of the total variance during the Holocene, implying that \nthe coupling of sea salt and dust is weak and the agreement between interstadial and \nHolocene slopes may be accidental. \n \nFor the shift between stadial and interstadial regimes, the different regression lines in Fig. \n8 imply that no common transport related covariance in sea salt and mineral dust can be \nassumed across stadial\/interstadial transitions. Accordingly, a definition of a joint PCI for \nboth regimes has to be questioned. In contrast, a sudden switch in the power \u03b1 occurred \nwhich may be attributed to a fast switch in atmospheric transport (leading to a different \nchange in atmospheric transport or life time for Ca2+ compared to Na+) or a sudden \nchange in the source strength for mineral dust and\/or sea salt.  \n \nUnfortunately, the coarse resolution GISP2 ion record does not allow precise resolution \nof the timing of this decoupling. On the GReenland Ice core Project (GRIP) ice core, \nCa2+ has been measured at high resolution using continuous flow analysis (CFA) [Fuhrer \net al., 1999], but sea salt data are not available at similar resolution. Only recently the \nnew NorthGRIP ice core [North Greenland Ice Core Project members, 2004] has been \ncompleted, where continuous CFA records have been measured for both Ca2+ and Na+ at \n1 cm resolution. In Fig. 9 an example of the latest CFA data from the NorthGRIP ice core \nis shown for the time period around IS3 and IS4. A sudden shift in the slope of Ca2+ \nduring the transition out of IS4 (at 1882.7m) and into IS3 (at 1869.1 m) can be \nrecognized. During the stadial\/interstadial transition the rise in Ca2+ becomes suddenly \nslower, while the rate of the Na+ increase remains the same. Vice versa dust suddenly \nincreases from the interstadial to the stadial, while sea salt shows a more gradual \nincrease. This is exactly what is observed in Fig. 8b where the slope in the Na+ vs Ca2+ \nscatter plot declines for cold intervals. The abruptness of this shift in Fig. 9, which occurs \nin only a couple of years, is outstanding and points to a sudden atmospheric \nreorganization, which could be linked to a short cut in the transport paths from the \nChinese deserts to Greenland. Increased dust emissions by a drastically changed dust \nstorm frequency or dust uplift may also result from a sudden change in atmospheric \ncirculation at the dust source. In contrast, changed weathering or soil surface conditions \nand vegetation cover at the source area are unlikely to change dust emissions from one \nyear to the other [Zou and Zhai, 2004]. An extended evaluation of the high-resolution \nNorth GRIP CFA data for other stadial\/interstadial transitions in this respect is currently \nunder way and will show whether this sudden shift is a persistent feature for all \nstadial\/interstadial transitions. \n \nWhile the change in aerosol composition may give some indication of transport and\/or \nsource changes it is not a conclusive parameter to quantify the transport effect. \nFortunately, also the size distribution of insoluble mineral dust, which is essentially \nFISCHER ET AL., DUST AND SEA SALT IN POLAR ICE CORES \n12 \nindependent of the source strength, allows an estimation of the change in transport time t \n(see Appendix A) and has been measured on selected intervals of Greenland ice cores \n[Steffensen, 1985; Steffensen, 1997; Zielinski and Mershon, 1997]. Latest techniques \nallowed also for a continuous determination of the size distribution in the NorthGRIP ice \ncore [Ruth et al., 2003] as shown in Fig. 10. The outstanding result of these studies is that \nthe average size mode of dust in Greenland during the LGM is 0.3-0.4 \u03bcm larger than for \nthe Preboreal (PB). Also stadial dust appears to be generally about 0.2-0.4 \u03bcm larger than \ninterstadial dust particles, although the scatter in the size mode on this time scale is \nconsiderable. Taking the results of this conceptual simplified transport model (as \npresented by Ruth et al. [2003] and modified in Appendix A) at face value, this translates \ninto a reduction in transport time (comprising both changes in wind speed as well as \nlength and spatial configuration of the transport path) of about 50% during the LGM \ncompared to the PB. For the stadial\/interstadial transitions a reduction in transport time \nby about 35% appears possible dependent on the particle size taken to be representative \nof glacial and interstadial conditions in Fig. 10.  \n \nAccording to equation 3 we can write for the change in atmospheric aerosol \nconcentration on top of the ice sheet  \n\u23a5\u23a6\n\u23a4\u23a2\u23a3\n\u23a1\n\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b \u2212= cold\nwarm\nwarm\ncold\nwarm\nwarm\nwarm\nair\ncold\nair\nwarm\nair\ncold\nair\nt\ntt\nC\nC\nC\nC\n\u03c4\n\u03c4\n\u03c4 1exp)0(\n)0(   (6). \nThe exponential term on the right hand side of equation (6) parameterizes the transport-\ninduced change in aerosol concentration and the scaling factor Caircold(0)\/Cairwarm(0) \ncomprises any source changes from warm to cold climate conditions. Based on the \noutcome of the conceptual model, changes in the size distribution imply that tLGM\/tPB\u22480.5 \n(see also Appendix A). In order to evaluate \u03c4PB\/\u03c4LGM we consider wet and dry deposition \nen route, where at lower latitudes wet deposition always dominates over dry deposition. \nModeling considerations by Andersen and Ditlevsen [1998] allow us to estimate that the \naverage precipitation rate in the LGM ALGM was about 50% of that in the preboreal period \nAPB and, thus, \u03c4PB\/\u03c4LGM \u2248 0.5. The ratio between transport time and lifetime for the PB can \nbe estimated from recent trajectory studies, where t is on the order of 10 days for the \ntransport of dust from East Asia to Greenland [Kahl et al., 1997]. The atmospheric \nlifetime of particulate dust has been estimated in atmospheric circulation model studies to \nbe about 4-10 days [Mahowald et al., 1999; Tegen and Fung, 1994; Timmreck and \nSchulz, 2004; Werner et al., 2002]. Accordingly, tPB\/\u03c4PB is somewhere between 2.5 and 1. \nWe take tPB\/\u03c4PB=2 as a best guess. Accordingly, a transport induced change in \natmospheric concentrations by a factor of 4.5 (with a range from 2-12) is possible \naccording to these 1D model considerations without invoking any additional change in \nC(0) in equation 6.  \n \nFor interstadial periods no information on aerosol life time is available from atmospheric \nGCM model experiments. We estimate the accompanying precipitation change as only \n50% of that from the LGM to the preboreal (\u03c4IS\/\u03c4S=0.75), use the transport time derived \nfrom the size distribution of tS\/tIS=0.65 (see Appendix A) and estimate tIS\/\u03c4IS=2 as for the \npreboreal. With these assumptions we arrive at a transport induced change in aerosol \nFISCHER ET AL., DUST AND SEA SALT IN POLAR ICE CORES \n13 \nconcentration from interstadials to stadials of a factor of 3 (with a range of 2-5 dependent \non the value taken to be representative for the mode during interstadials). \n \nThese numbers compare to an observed increase in dust concentration of a factor of 80 \nfor LGM\/Holocene and a factor of 15 for stadial\/interstadial transitions, which only \nslightly overestimate the change in atmospheric concentration (see section 3.1.). In \nconclusion, the change in transport and lifetime is an important process for long-term \nchanges in atmospheric dust but can explain only 15% of the glacial\/interglacial and 40% \nof the observed stadial\/interstadial concentration changes, implying that also significant \nchanges in the dust source areas (such as aridity or local wind speeds) must have \noccurred [Ruth et al., 2003]. A similar conclusion has also been drawn in an earlier study \n[Fuhrer et al., 1999] based solely on concentration records and conceptual model \nconsiderations. Given that the effect in Fig. 8 is solely due to transport we can apply the \nchange of transport time for dust at face value to sea salt aerosol and use the scaling \nfactor \u03b1 as determined from the slopes in Fig. 8. This scaling factor \u03b1 is smaller during \nstadials which implies that the change in transport time for mineral dust was larger than \nfor sea salt during stadials. Accordingly, the factor for the rise of sea salt concentrations \ndue to transport changes during interstadial\/stadial transitions was most likely smaller \nthan the dust derived factor of 3. \n \nFor Antarctica, a common influence of transport efficiency on sea salt and mineral dust \naerosol seems to be even less important than for Greenland. As outlined in Figs. 3, 4 and \n7 the sensitivity of changes in sea salt aerosol to climate variations is significantly smaller \nthan for mineral dust. This is also illustrated in the scatter plot shown in Fig. 11. Here, we \nused fluxes instead of concentrations, because fluxes are more representative of \natmospheric concentrations in the low accumulation areas of the East Antarctic plateau \nand corrected for the sea salt and crustal contribution in Ca2+ and Na+, respectively (note, \nhowever, that the picture looks essentially the same for concentrations). Again two clouds \nof points emerge for cold glacial and warm Holocene conditions. However, in contrast to \nGreenland, mineral dust is essentially uncorrelated to sea salt in the Holocene as reflected \nin the large range of sea salt fluxes compared to constantly low fluxes of mineral dust. \nVice versa in the glacial period, sea salt fluxes exhibit rather constant values of around 80 \nng\/cm\u00b2a while the mineral dust flux is highly variable at that time. Accordingly there \nseems to be no strong functional dependence between sea salt and mineral dust \n[R\u00f6thlisberger et al., 2002] and a common change in transport time or atmospheric \nlifetime is unlikely to dominate the sea salt and dust variations within either the Holocene \nor the glacial. Note, however, that transport paths of both species to Antarctica are \ndifferent and may have experienced unrelated changes. \n \nDue to the extremely low accumulation rates on the East Antarctic plateau no seasonally \nresolved records for sea salt and mineral dust have been obtained that would allow us to \nfurther disentangle source and transport changes. However, size distribution \nmeasurements have been performed on central Antarctic ice cores [Delmonte et al., \n2004b; Delmonte et al., 2002; Petit et al., 1990], which may help to quantify the transport \neffect by observations. Unfortunately, the outcome of these studies is ambiguous. While \nsize distributions at Dome C and also at Komsomolskaya (located about 900 km west of \nFISCHER ET AL., DUST AND SEA SALT IN POLAR ICE CORES \n14 \nDome C and 550 km north of Vostok) support a 0.2-0.4 \u03bcm smaller mode of the size \ndistribution at the LGM compared to the early Holocene, the same parameter at Dome B \n(located closer to Vostok) shows the opposite behavior, i.e. significantly (0.4-0.5 \u03bcm) \nlarger particles in the late glacial [Delmonte et al., 2004b]. This would imply a longer \nglacial transport time for Dome C and, thus, a reduction in atmospheric dust \nconcentrations at Dome  but a shorter transport time for Dome B! Delmonte et al. [2004b] \nargue that two different pathways must exist for dust in Antarctica. They suggest that \nsmaller particles could be delivered preferentially by upper tropospheric transport, while \nlarger particles may be transported along a lower altitude pathway. Accordingly, \nDelmonte et al. [2004b] interpret small particles as being associated with the center of \natmospheric subsidence in the polar vortex. Thus, if this hypothesis is correct, the ice \ncore results would point to a stronger subsidence of high altitude air masses at Dome C \nand Komsomolskaya in the glacial than during the Holocene while Dome B shows the \nopposite behavior. At first glance this hypothesis is in contradiction with the higher \naltitude of Dome B (3650 m a.s.l.) compared to Dome C (3233 m a.s.l.) and \nKomsomolskaya (3500 m a.s.l.) and its greater distance from the coast. Preliminary dust \nsize measurements on the new EPICA ice core in Dronning Maud Land located in the \nAtlantic sector of Antarctica show on average similar particle sizes during the Holocene \nand the LGM, however, individual large particle events occur during the Holocene, \nwhich vigorous transport on the ice sheet at those times. In summary, the opposite \nbehavior of particle size changes for different ice cores underlines the complexity of \ntransport processes to the ice sheet and precludes a generalized estimate of the change in \ntransport efficiency to Antarctica. \n \n3.3. Changes in sources \nWhile hemispheric transport of sea salt and mineral dust to remote areas is linked to \noverall changes in atmospheric circulation and the deposition of both species on top of \nthe ice sheets follows similar processes, the sources of these two aerosol species are \ngeographically distinct and aerosol generation over the ocean and continental desert \nregions may be linked to different synoptic weather patterns.  \n \nMineral dust  \nMineral dust aerosol formation is most efficient in arid and potentially semiarid regions, \nwhere weathering is sufficiently high to replenish fine dust particles while soil-moisture \nis sufficiently low to allow for dust mobilization. In contrast, hyperarid regions such as \nthe core of the Australian continent, are most often depleted in available dust because \nweathering rates are too small and deflation has been active for a long time period [Rea, \n1994]. In the source regions dust mobilization is dependent on surface wind speed u, \ncausing dust fluxes into the atmosphere to be proportional to u\u00b3 whenever the wind speed \nexceeds a threshold velocity which is soil-moisture dependent [Gillete and Passi, 1988; \nGillette et al., 1980; Marticorena and Bergametti, 1995].  \n \nSince the advent of satellite imagery a global picture of modern dust emissions and long-\nrange export of mobilized dust plumes has been obtained. Recently, Prospero et al. \n[2002] published an overview of active dust sources based on an aerosol absorption index \nderived from the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS). This identified the North \nFISCHER ET AL., DUST AND SEA SALT IN POLAR ICE CORES \n15 \nAfrican and Arabian peninsula desert regions as the main source for dust globally with \nsignificant westward transport of dust over the subtropical Atlantic. However, arid areas \nin Asia and here especially the desert regions in China (Tarim Basin, Taklamakan and \nGobi desert) also represent efficient dust sources leading to long-range transport of dust \nover the Northern Pacific [Gong et al., 2003; Prospero et al., 2002]. Although overall \ndust emissions in the southern hemisphere are much smaller than in the north, important \nmodern dust sources are located in Australia, in some regions of southern Africa and in \nSouth America (Bolivian Altiplano and Patagonia). For glacial times most of these \nsources were also active, as reflected in loess formations as well as increased deposition \nof eolian dust in the pelagic ocean downwind of these sources ([Kohfeld and Harrison, \n2001; Porter and An, 1995; Rea, 1994; Sun, 2002; Xiao and An, 1999] and references \ntherein). \n \nIce core studies provide important clues for the identification of source regions of dust. \nStudying the mineralogical composition of dust in the GRIP ice core, Maggi [1997] has \nshown that dust generation during warm periods was dominated by chemical weathering \nwhile during cold periods physical weathering became more important. Isotopic \nprovenance studies represent an even more powerful tool to constrain source regions. For \nGreenland the Sr\/Nd isotopic composition clearly points to Asian desert regions in China \nas the primary source for dust today and in glacial times [Biscaye et al., 1997; Bory et al., \n2003; Svensson et al., 2000]. These provenance studies, however, are only as \nunambiguous as reference samples of dust from desert regions exist. This represents a \nparticular problem if new dust source regions were activated during the glacial, as e.g. \nexposed shelf areas or high latitude Arctic regions, for which no modern reference \nsamples are available. The isotopic provenance studies are also in line with recent \ntrajectory studies of air mass transport to Greenland [Kahl et al., 1997], which show that \nthe majority of trajectories enter Greenland from the west, virtually excluding the Sahara \nas an important dust source for the Greenland ice sheet.  \n \nIn Antarctica, comparable isotopic studies have been performed [Basile et al., 1997; \nDelmonte et al., 2004a; Delmonte et al., 2004b; Grousset et al., 1992]. Again the problem \nof the availability of reference samples for all possible source areas applies. Despite this \nlimitation, these studies clearly show that the dust deposited during the glacial at all the \ninvestigated ice core drill sites in East Antarctica is derived mainly from Patagonia with \nsubstantial contributions also from Australia [Revel-Rolland et al., 2006] during the \nHolocene. A shift in terrestrial dust composition is also suggested by a change in the \n3He\/4He ratio in particulate terrestrial dust as derived from the EPICA ice core in \nDronning Maud Land [Winckler and Fischer, 2006], A strong Patagonian source is also \nbroadly in line with air trajectory studies [Reijmer and van den Broeke, 2000; Reijmer et \nal., 2002], which show that air mass transport to all Antarctic ice core drill sites follows a \ncyclonically curved pathway, which originates in the low pressure trough around the \nAntarctic continent. Only Patagonian dust sources seem to be high enough in latitude to \nfuel those circulation patterns with mineral dust. A similar trajectory study by Lunt and \nValdes [2001] based on atmospheric GCM results forced with modern and LGM SSTs \nalso supports a predominant South American origin of aeolian dust in Antarctica both \ntoday and at the LGM.  \nFISCHER ET AL., DUST AND SEA SALT IN POLAR ICE CORES \n16 \n \nThe question remains, whether exposed Argentine Shelf areas may have added to the \nPatagonian dust sources during the glacial. Based on Al, Ca and Mg measurements over \nthe last glacial cycle in the Vostok ice core, de Angelis [1992] concludes that glacial dust \noriginated in part from marine carbonates. de Angelis [1992] estimates that up to 50% of \nthe dust during the glacial may originate from exposed continental shelf areas. However, \nthe identification of mineralogy based on bulk concentrations in ice core samples is not \nunambiguous. Measurements of the Sr\/Nd isotopic composition by Basile et al. [1997] \nyielded a small difference between ice core and marine reference samples from the \nArgentinean Shelf. However, this offset is now explained as the result of different size \nfractions showing different isotopic compositions and the Argentine Shelf cannot be \nexcluded on the basis of these measurements [Delmonte et al., 2005]. Independent \ninformation on the role of Argentine shelf areas as sources for Antarctic dust can be \nderived from a comparison of the temporal evolution of glacial\/interglacial sea level \nchanges and dust fluxes in Antarctica. For older terminations the relative dating \nuncertainty of sea level estimates and ice core dust records does not allow an \nunambiguous answer. During the last termination, however, major shifts in sea level on \nthe Argentine shelf [Guilderson et al., 2000] significantly lagged the strong decline in \ndust at the beginning of the transition [Wolff et al., 2005]. In contrast to the late global ice \nvolume decline, hence sea level increase, an early Patagonian deglaciation is supported \nby some geomorphological evidence [Sugden et al., 2005]. In summary, a dominant \nincrease in the continental dust source in Patagonia appears to be more likely to explain \nthe Antarctic dust variations than exposed shelf areas. \n \nSea salt aerosol \nAlthough sea salt represents the most abundant aerosol component in the atmosphere, \nconsiderably less is known about the sources of sea salt aerosol for the Greenland and \nAntarctic ice sheets. One reason is the lack of isotopic tracers to constrain the \ngeographical origin of sea salt aerosol because the ocean is well mixed. In particular, the \ninfluence of sea salt aerosol derived from sea ice versus that derived from the open ocean \non the sea salt budget on the ice sheets is still an open question. Globally, the most \nimportant source of sea salt is the dispersion of sea water over the open ocean which is \nalso dependent on wind speed. Different parameterizations exist, approximating the wind \nspeed dependence of the sea salt generation flux by a power or exponential law [Guelle et \nal., 2001]. Highest wind speeds and efficient transport of sea salt aerosol to the polar ice \nsheets are connected to cyclonic activity over the open ocean which is concentrated along \nthe polar fronts in both hemispheres. Accordingly, ice core chemistry [Fischer and \nMieding, 2005; Fischer et al., 2004; Kreutz et al., 2000] and meteorological [Chen et al., \n1997; Noone et al., 1999; Reijmer and van den Broeke, 2000; Simmonds and Keay, 2000] \nstudies were able to show that recent sea salt deposition and precipitation both in \nGreenland and Antarctica are closely connected to cyclonic activity over the North \nAtlantic and the Southern Ocean, respectively. This effect comprises both efficient \ngeneration and uplift of sea salt within frontal systems as well as the guidance of storm \ntracks by large scale pressure patterns onto the ice sheets. A recent study by Fischer and \nMieding [2005] revealed a doubling of multidecadal Na+ concentrations in northern \nGreenland in parallel to SST variations of approximately 0.5\u00b0C over the last 150 years. \nFISCHER ET AL., DUST AND SEA SALT IN POLAR ICE CORES \n17 \nPeriods of higher sea salt concentrations have been related to changes in storm tracks \nover the North Atlantic in this study. Applying this modern relationship to the glacial, the \nsea salt increases during Dansgaard Oeschger events would require a surface cooling of \nabout 2\u00b0C, which is at the lower end of values observed in marine sediment records \n[McManus et al., 1999]. Of course this late Holocene relationship cannot be directly \nextrapolated to glacial conditions when sea ice coverage and storm tracks had \nconsiderably changed. However, it shows that changes in storm tracks even during rather \nstable warm climate conditions can result in large effects on sea salt aerosol deposition on \nthe Greenland ice sheet. \n \nDispersion of frost flowers, generated on the water surface during the formation of sea \nice, has recently been reported to represent another efficient way to produce sea salt \naerosol (further on referred to as sea ice salt) especially for coastal regions close to the \nsea ice formation zone [Rankin et al., 2000; Rankin and Wolff, 2003; Wagenbach et al., \n1998]. This process may also represent a potential sea salt aerosol source for the \nAntarctic plateau [Wolff et al., 2003]. During this process the precipitation of mirabilite \n(Na2SO4 . 10H2O) leads to a weak depletion of Na+ and a strong depletion of SO42- \nrelative to Cl- in frost flower derived sea salt aerosol particles relative to ocean water. \nThis effect can be clearly discerned in coastal Antarctic aerosol samples [Wagenbach et \nal., 1998]. A detection of sea ice salt in the interior of the ice sheet using its characteristic \nionic composition, however, is difficult. Among other reasons, this is because Cl- in \nAntarctic aerosol and snow [R\u00f6thlisberger et al., 2003; Wagenbach et al., 1998] often \nshows an enrichment compared to Na+ in summer due to a larger atmospheric lifetime of \ngaseous HCl released from sea salt aerosol in acidic environments [Legrand et al., 2002; \nLegrand and Delmas, 1988]. In addition the dominance of other SO42- sources in the \nsulfate budget on the ice sheets in summer and partly in winter [Fischer et al., 1998b; \nHammer, 1997; Legrand, 1995] masks a sea ice salt contribution for both recent as well \nas glacial conditions. However, some aerosol evidence exists: one selected sea salt \naerosol deposition event at South Pole station showed a clear sulfate depletion [Wolff et \nal., 2003]. In addition, one year of aerosol sampling at Dome Fuji on the East Antarctic \nplateau revealed unambiguous evidence of sulfate depleted sea salt aerosol during austral \nwinter [Hara et al., 2004] with the degree of the sulfate depletion being similar to coastal \nAntarctic sites. Based on air mass trajectories originating in the mid latitudes Hara et al. \n[2004] discarded a sea ice origin of those fractionated sea salt events at Dome Fuji and \nsuggested a local fractionation process by evaporation at the snow surface. However, \npostdepositional changes in the snowpack have never been observed for Na+ or SO42-. In \naddition, the air mass trajectories to Dome Fuji [Hara et al., 2004] passed over the sea ice \nzone and may have picked up fractionated sea ice salt en route. In summary, we feel that \nthe aerosol samples from Dome Fuji represent the so far strongest direct evidence \ndocumenting an influence of sea ice salt formation on the sea salt aerosol budget of the \ninterior of Antarctica. However, a quantitative estimate of the relative contributions of \nsea salt aerosol from the open ocean and from sea ice has not been established yet for the \nEast Antarctic plateau.  \n \nWhat circumstantial evidence does exist for a recent contribution of frost flowers to the \nsea salt deposition on the Antarctic plateau? The seasonal variation of sea salt species in \nFISCHER ET AL., DUST AND SEA SALT IN POLAR ICE CORES \n18 \nice cores shows a maximum in winter\/spring in Dronning Maud Land, where snow \naccumulation is high enough to resolve annual cycles [G\u00f6ktas et al., 2002; Sommer et al., \n2000]. This is the time when sea ice is at its maximum and therefore the open water \nsource is located farthest away. Frost flower formation occurs whenever surface \ntemperatures are cold enough to sustain refreezing of wind driven leads, which may occur \neverywhere in sea ice covered areas. To first order, the sea ice salt source is therefore \nexpected to be proportional to the areal extent of winter sea ice cover for modern \nconditions. However, the transport time of sea ice salt aerosol to the central Antarctic \nincreases the further away sea ice salt is formed. Accordingly, the influence of a sea ice \nsalt source diminishes with distance to the drill site. On the other hand transport \nvelocities are increased in winter for modern conditions [Reijmer et al., 2002] \ncompensating at least partly for the increased distance of a sea ice and open ocean aerosol \nsource. In addition, summer sea ice may also represent a sea ice salt source if \ntemperatures are low enough to sustain refreezing of leads as may have been partly the \ncase during the glacial.  \n \nBased on this observational evidence for sea ice salt formation in ice covered areas we \nattempt to estimate the potential increase of this source during the glacial. If we assume \nthat the amount of freshly formed sea ice in open leads (thus of potentially frost flower \ncovered regions) is proportional to the sea ice coverage and neglect the effect of transport \ndistance, we can estimate a maximum increase in the source of sea ice salt for the glacial \nusing paleoreconstructions of sea ice extent. We estimate that the modern winter sea ice \nedge is located on average at around 60\u00b0S around Antarctica. Reconstructions of the sea \nice extent in the glacial point to a substantially larger sea ice extent in winter reaching as \nfar as 45\u00b0S and beyond. On average we use a value of 50 \u00b0S for the glacial winter sea ice \nedge [Cooke and Hays, 1982; Crosta et al., 1998; Gersonde et al., 2003; Gersonde et al., \n2005]. Today the summer sea ice edge is close to the coast in most areas of the Antarctic \ncontinent or to the edge of the offshore ice shelves (approximately 70\u00b0S). During the \nglacial the summer sea ice extent was increased to about 60\u00b0S in some regions such as \nthe Weddell Sea while in others it was unchanged, although the summer sea ice evidence \nis scarce. For our estimate this may imply a considerable amount of perennial sea ice \nwhich may not be as efficient as a sea ice salt source. Accordingly, we calculate an upper \nlimit of the sea ice salt source by assuming that perennial and seasonally covered areas \ncontributed equally to the sea ice salt source. In that case we add the area of summer sea \nice cover to the winter area to calculate a total sea ice area. This area is compared to the \nrecent winter sea ice coverage which is the only season contributing to sea ice salt \nformation today. In addition we calculate a lower limit where we assume that perennial \nsea ice did not contribute to sea ice salt formation at all, which probably underestimates \nthe real conditions. Using these assumptions the sea ice salt source may have been \nbetween 1.6 and 3.2 time more extensive during the glacial. This does not necessarily \nimply, that the sea ice salt formation was also a factor of 2-3 larger in the LGM than in \nthe Holocene, because areas covered by sea ice in the glacial but not in the Holocene are \nopen ocean sources for sea salt aerosol in the Holocene. So far the lack of any systematic \nflux studies on the sea ice salt formation process precludes a better quantification.  \n \nFISCHER ET AL., DUST AND SEA SALT IN POLAR ICE CORES \n19 \nFor Greenland the situation is even more complex. Sea ice in the modern North Atlantic \nis mostly formed in the Arctic basin and exported through Fram and Davis Straits and \nmelts slowly when entering warmer waters. In situ formation of sea ice is therefore only \nof secondary importance in the North Atlantic. Thus, there are only limited regions of \nactive sea ice salt formation around central and southern Greenland today. We conclude \nthat the open ocean is the primary sea salt source for modern conditions and cyclonic \nactivity over the northern Atlantic leads to transport of sea salt aerosol onto the \nGreenland ice sheet.  \n \nFor the LGM, cyclonic activity was still strong over the Atlantic and a permanent cyclone \nhas been found in an atmospheric GCM over the Baffin Bay [Krinner and Genthon, \n1998]. However, sea ice extent was also greatly enhanced in the North Atlantic at that \ntime. To answer the question of the potential role of sea ice salt for the sea salt deposition \non top of the Greenland ice sheet during the LGM, reconstructions of sea ice extent \nbecome crucial. In the recent GLAMAP2000 project, a renewed effort was made to \nestimate SST in the North Atlantic during the LGM using foraminiferal assemblages. \nFrom this temperature information, winter and summer sea ice extents have been deduced \n[Pflaumann et al., 2003; Sarnthein et al., 2003]. This analysis shows that the summer sea \nice edge protruded to 70-75 \u00b0N and the winter ice edge extended to 50-70 \u00b0N. This is less \nthan estimated earlier [CLIMAP project members, 1976, 1981] but would still imply a \nconsiderable change in sea ice extent compared to the present. The sea ice extent was \nderived using an empirical modern temperature calibration, which assumes the presence \nof summer sea ice whenever the reconstructed summer sea surface temperature was \nbelow +2.5\u00b0C and winter sea ice when winter sea surface temperatures were below +0.75 \nor +0.4\u00b0C. In any case these threshold temperatures are too warm to allow for in situ sea \nice formation and reflect the fact that sea ice found in the North Atlantic today is mainly \nexported from its cold source areas in the Arctic basin into warmer North Atlantic waters. \nAccordingly, while this calibration may allow to estimate the total sea ice coverage for \nthe LGM it does not allow us to quantify the area of in situ sea ice formation. While cold \ntemperatures and katabatic winds along the east coast of Greenland may have allowed for \nglacial in situ sea ice formation the total area of potential frost flower formation was \nclearly smaller than the ice cover estimated by GLAMAP2000. This reduces the \nimportance of an increased glacial North Atlantic sea ice salt source to the sea salt \naerosol budget for the Greenland ice sheet significantly. \n \n4. Aerosol generation and transport in general circulation models  \n4.1 Modeled changes in aerosol emissions \nVarious modeling studies have been performed to simulate changes in dust emissions in \npotential source regions and to compare them to dust records from polar ice sheets for \nglacial and interglacial conditions. First attempts failed to simulate significant glacial \nincreases in ice core concentrations [Genthon, 1992; Joussaume, 1990, 1993]. However, \nmore recent models were able to simulate considerable increases in the source strength of \nmineral dust. In general an intensification of global dust emissions of a factor of 2-3 can \nbe derived from those models, however, the reasons for these increases differ \nconsiderably between different modeling studies with changes in wind speed [Reader et \nal., 1999; Werner et al., 2002], soil moisture [Andersen et al., 1998; Reader et al., 1999] \nFISCHER ET AL., DUST AND SEA SALT IN POLAR ICE CORES \n20 \nand\/or vegetation cover [Mahowald et al., 1999; Werner et al., 2002] contributing to the \nsimulated changes. Emission changes for Asian deserts and Patagonia, which are most \nrelevant for dust changes in Greenland and Antarctica, respectively, also changed by a \nfactor of 2-3 in these models. An underestimation of dust emissions from central Asia for \nmodern conditions is indicated by dust deposition which is a factor of 5 too low close to \nthe Asian source [Mahowald et al., 1999]. Again, modern dust deposition on the \nGreenland ice sheet is a factor of 2-5 too high in some modeling studies [Andersen et al., \n1998; Mahowald et al., 1999], probably related to an overestimation of transport of \nbackground dust aerosol from lower latitudes.  \n \nIn the models by Mahowald et al. [1999] and Werner et al. [2002], which include an \ninteractive vegetation scheme, the expansion of existing dust sources and the activation \nof additional high latitude dust source regions (Siberia, Kamchatka, Alaska) during the \nglacial play a significant role. Mahowald et al. [1999] simulated a twofold expansion of \ndesert areas in the LGM, which led to higher global dust emissions by a factor of 3 and \nabout 20 times higher dust loads in the northern high latitude atmosphere. However, in \nthe study by Werner et al. [2002] only 35% of the increase in dust emissions is caused by \nexpansion of dust sources while 65% (in Asia 88%) is due to an increase in wind speed. \nInterestingly, the total glacial dust emission in this study (about 2400Mt\/yr) is lower than \nthe present day emission in Mahowald et al. [1999] (about 3000 Mt\/yr). Note also that a \nstrong contribution of high latitude dust sources for the LGM is apparently in \ncontradiction with the isotopic provenance studies described in section 3.3, which, \nhowever, are based on the currently limited knowledge in terms of dust provenance \nsamples. \n \nFor Antarctica a 100% glacial increase in Patagonian dust emissions and a 60% increase \nof southern hemisphere low latitude sources compared to present day has been modeled \n[Andersen et al., 1998] leading to an increase in dust deposition in the Antarctic ice sheet \nof a factor of 1.4. Models with interactive vegetation schemes [Mahowald et al., 1999; \nWerner et al., 2002] predict that the majority of dust deposited in Antarctica originates \nfrom Patagonia, but significant dust deposition in Antarctica from Australian sources is \nfound as well. Interestingly, all models overestimate recent dust deposition in Greenland \nbut strongly underestimate it in Antarctica. The latter is so pronounced as to preclude any \nquantitative conclusions on changes in the dust cycle in the southern hemisphere so far \n[Mahowald et al., 1999; Werner et al., 2002].  \n \nIn summary, East Asian and Patagonian dust sources have been unambiguously \nrecognized in climate models as the main source regions for glacial age and modern dust \nin Greenland and Antarctica, respectively. Model studies are able to simulate an increase \nin dust emissions by a factor of 2-3 during the LGM. The different ways different models \narrive at similar results shows that so far no consensus on the reason for dust emission \nchanges has been reached. An underrepresentation of the Asian dust sources suggests that \nthe meterological situation leading to dust mobilization in this region (frontal systems and \nstrong uplift due to topography [Sun, 2002]) is not well represented, most likely due to \nthe insufficient spatial and temporal resolution of the models. While the limited spatial \nresolution suppresses important processes linked to surface topography such as uplift in \nFISCHER ET AL., DUST AND SEA SALT IN POLAR ICE CORES \n21 \nmountainous regions, both spatial and temporal resolution limit the wind speed \ndistribution. Especially the upper end of the wind speed distribution has a strong effect on \ndust mobilization and an increase in gustiness during the glacial may explain another \nfactor of 2-4 increase in dust mobilization.  \n \nFor sea salt aerosol, significantly less is known from general circulation models. Most \nmodel studies take only sea salt formation at the open ocean surface into account while \nsea ice salt aerosol formation on sea ice covered areas has only been treated in one model \nstudy [Reader and McFarlane, 2003], using a simplified emission scheme for sea ice salt \ngeneration. Those models which do not include a sea ice salt source [Genthon, 1992; \nReader and McFarlane, 2003] show that the LGM sea salt deposition in Antarctica is \nreduced compared to modern conditions, essentially reflecting the longer transport time \nfrom the open ocean to the ice sheet due to the expansion of sea ice. Accordingly, an \nenhanced glacial sea ice salt source provides an efficient means to overcome the \ndiscrepancy between expanded sea ice cover, hence larger distance to the open ocean, \nand increased sea salt fluxes in Antarctic ice cores [Wolff et al., 2003]. By including a sea \nice salt source Reader and McFarlane [2003] were just able to model approximately \nunchanged LGM concentrations in central Antarctica compared to modern conditions, \nhowever, the strength of the sea ice salt source in that model is insufficiently constrained \ndue to the lack of empirical flux measurements.  \n \nFor Greenland the model by Reader and McFarlane [2003] predicted 2.5-5 times higher \nsea salt aerosol concentrations during the LGM when the sea ice salt source was \nincluded. But in this model sea ice coverage, hence, sea ice salt formation was prescribed \naccording to CLIMAP [CLIMAP project members, 1981], which overestimates the sea \nice salt source because of two reasons: first because the CLIMAP sea ice reconstruction \nis now believed to overestimate sea ice coverage in the glacial North Atlantic [Pflaumann \net al., 2003; Sarnthein et al., 2003] and second because in situ formation and export of \nsea ice from the Arctic basin has not been distinguished. Clearly, more advanced \nmodeling studies of sea ice formation in the glacial North Atlantic including sea ice salt \ngeneration are necessary to further constrain the sea ice salt source for the Greenland ice \ncore concentrations. \n \n4.2 Atmospheric circulation changes  \nIndependent information on atmospheric circulation and, hence, also aerosol transport \nchanges between the LGM and the Holocene can be derived from General Circulation \nmodels. In principle a more vigorous atmospheric circulation can be expected from the \nlarger temperature gradient between the poles and the equator during LGM conditions. \nWhether this leads to increased transport of aerosol to Greenland and Antarctica, \nhowever, depends on the spatial configuration of SSTs which force glacial\/interglacial \nchanges in the strength and spatial patterns of atmospheric circulation. For example, \nstronger westerlies and higher cyclonic activity are modeled in northern middle latitudes \n[Bush and Philander, 1999; Shin et al., 2003] during the LGM, however the core of the \nwesterly jet is displaced by about 3\u00b0 equatorwards in an ocean atmosphere GCM [Bush \nand Philander, 1999] as well as in simplified models [Andersen and Ditlevsen, 1998; \nChylek et al., 2001; Ganopolski, 1998]. In addition this overall change is modified in the \nFISCHER ET AL., DUST AND SEA SALT IN POLAR ICE CORES \n22 \nnorthern hemisphere by the presence of the large ice sheets. The Laurentide ice sheet in \nparticular represents a topographic barrier for atmospheric flow in the models. \nAccordingly, a split of the atmospheric jet into routes south and north of the Laurentide \nice sheet is found in some climate models [Bromwich et al., 2004; Bush and Philander, \n1999; Shin et al., 2003] for the LGM. If this split occurred, the northern branch of the jet \nwould represent a shortened transport pathway of mineral dust from the Chinese desert \nregions to the Greenland ice sheet. However, the existence of a split jet stream in models \nis sensitive to the reconstructed altitude of the ice sheet [Peltier, 1994; Zweck and \nHuybrechts, 2005], which has been questioned e.g. for Greenland [Cuffey and Clow, \n1997; Raynaud et al., 1997].  \n \nIn the southern hemisphere the study by Shin et al. [2003] points to a slightly stronger \nzonal wind stress in the Southern Ocean for the LGM and a slight southward shift of the \nmaximum wind stress. Despite the increased glacial wind speed in the Antarctic \nCircumpolar Current (ACC) region Krinner and Genthon [1998] report a significant \nreduction of cyclonic activity and on average higher sea level pressure around Antarctica, \nwhich implies a reduced intrusion of marine air masses onto the ice sheet. For Dome C a \nmodel study by Lunt and Valdes [2001] indicates a reduced frequency of back trajectories \noriginating over Patagonia and other continental areas in the Southern hemisphere for the \nLGM, implying a reduced meridional transport of mineral dust to this site. \n \n4.3 Modeled changes in aerosol lifetime and transport \nChanges in transport efficiency and atmospheric lifetime of aerosols may in principle be \nderived from those atmospheric GCMs which explicitly simulate atmospheric transport of \ndust and sea salt aerosol. Unfortunately, simulated changes in wind speed for other \nclimate conditions also affect aerosol emissions, which - dependent on the setup of model \nexperiments - often precludes an unambiguous separation of source and transport effects \nin the literature.  \n \nOverall, the change in transport time in circulation models is significantly smaller than \nindicated by the aerosol size distribution in ice cores. In a model experiment by Tegen \nand Rind [2000] the latitudinal temperature gradient was increased to simulate glacial \nconditions while keeping the average global temperature constant. This increases the \nbaroclinicity of the atmosphere while keeping total precipitation essentially constant. \nThis experiment shows an increase of dust concentrations in Greenland derived from \nAsian dust sources by a factor 2.4. Given that the strength of the Chinese dust source in \nthis model experiment also increased by a factor of 3.5, intensification of transport is \nlimited in this model. In a second experiment Tegen and Rind [2000] also reduced the \nglobal temperature, which leads to less precipitation and, thus, longer lifetimes of dust in \nthe atmosphere. Doing this, the atmospheric concentration over Greenland was enhanced \nby an additional factor of 1.3 compared to the first experiment and by a factor of 3 \ncompared to the modern control run. Given that the glacial increase in dust emission from \nChinese dust sources was only 40 % in this reduced temperature run compared to the first \nexperiment, an increase of Greenland concentrations by a factor of 2-3 due to a longer \natmospheric life time can be deduced.  \n \nFISCHER ET AL., DUST AND SEA SALT IN POLAR ICE CORES \n23 \nIn a 2-D model an increase in dust of a factor of 2-3 was deduced for Antarctica by \nreducing the washout rate [Yung et al., 1996] in the atmosphere. However, in more \ncomplex 3D models (e.g. Mahowald et al. [1999]) the global average atmospheric \nlifetime of dust (about 4 days) has been reported to have changed insignificantly. In a \nsimilar modeling study by Werner et al. [2002] the global average lifetime is 2.8 days \ntoday and increases to 3.5 days for the LGM, however, dust lifetimes in high latitudes \nhave not been given explicitly. In the study by Reader et al. [1999] the change in \nGreenland and Antarctic concentrations due to transport and deposition en route has been \nspecified for individual source regions. Here, especially the transport effect of dust export \nto Greenland from Asian sources (including a reduction in transport time and an increase \nin atmospheric lifetime) explains a concentration increase of a factor of 2-4, while for \nAntarctica a decrease in transport efficiency of 30% was deduced. In summary, while a \ndoubling of the atmospheric lifetime by reduced precipitation rartes en route [Yung et al., \n1996] appears to be a sufficient way to increase atmospheric aerosol concentrations in \nAntarctica, the available 3D model results to date do not support such a strong change.  \n \n5. Summary and Conclusions \nSea salt and mineral dust concentrations and fluxes in polar ice cores from both \nhemispheres are subject to strong variations in parallel to climate variations with always \nhigher values for cold climate periods. In Table 2 we summarize our best guess estimates \non the contribution of individual processes on this overall glacial\/interglacial changes. \nAlthough local deposition changes on top of the ice sheets due to variations in snow \naccumulation rates affect the information archived in the ice cores this effect is rather \nlimited. In case of the low accumulation areas in East Antarctica, the flux is a reliable \nrecorder of atmospheric concentrations overlying the ice sheet while in Greenland the \nsnow concentration is the better parameter overestimating the change in atmospheric \nconcentrations only slightly. In any case local deposition effects cannot explain the order \nof magnitude changes in sea salt and mineral dust records in polar ice cores. Thus, \nstronger sources, more efficient transport and\/or less deposition en route must be the \nmain drivers of the observed increases in the sea salt and mineral dust ice core records \nduring glacial periods.  \n \nProvenance and meteorological studies show that the desert regions in China are the main \nsource for dust in Greenland for modern and LGM conditions while Patagonia is the main \nsource for glacial dust in Antarctica with Australia representing a substantial additional \nsource during the Holocene [Revel-Rolland et al., 2006]. A summary of modeling studies \nsupports an increase in global dust emission of a factor of 2-4 in the LGM. However, the \ndifferent ways different models arrive at that number may allow for a significantly larger \nglacial increase. The close correspondence of climate and dust records in Greenland with \nthe Chinese loess records (essentially recording local mobilization of dust in the Chinese \ndesert regions) even on millennial time scales [Porter, 2001] shows that such emission \nchanges in the Chinese dust source did occur between the LGM and the Holocene as well \nas during stadial\/interstadial transitions.  \n \nFor the sea salt source significantly less is known. Recent studies on coastal and inland \nAntarctic aerosol [Hara et al., 2004; Rankin and Wolff, 2003; Wagenbach et al., 1998] \nFISCHER ET AL., DUST AND SEA SALT IN POLAR ICE CORES \n24 \nshow that frost flowers generated during sea ice formation are an important source for sea \nsalt in addition to the open ocean. We presented a first order estimate that shows that this \nsource may have been 2-3 times stronger around Antarctica during the glacial, however at \nthe same time the increased sea ice cover would have reduced the open ocean source. So \nfar the lack of knowledge on the emission flux from the sea ice source precludes a more \nquantitative estimate and systematic studies on sea salt emission from sea ice are urgently \nneeded to illuminate this problem.  \n \nIn the case of Greenland sea ice reconstructions for the North Atlantic do not allow for a \nquantitative estimate of the sea ice salt source so far. Future refined sea ice modeling \nefforts for the LGM may identify the locations of sea ice formation, and hence potential \nsea ice salt production, in the North Atlantic during glacial times. While cyclonic activity \nover the North Atlantic was generally enhanced during cold periods, the storm tracks \nwere shifted southward. Thus the evidence for an increase in the open ocean sea salt \nsources is also not unambiguous. Based on modeling results we estimate that the sea salt \naerosol source for Greenland has changed by a factor of 1-3. These estimates do not \ninclude a potential underestimation of the gustiness during LGM and stadial climate \nconditions, which cannot be resolved by circulation models to date. We argue that an \nadditional factor of 2 in the source strength of both sea salt and mineral dust can be \nexplained by the high tail in the wind speed distribution. \n \nBoth observational constraints using the size distribution of particulate dust as well as \ncirculation models suggest a possible increase in transport efficiency due to shorter \ntransport times and prolonged atmospheric lifetimes for Greenland. The size of this effect \nhowever differs, with ice core data indicating a transport related increase by a factor of \n4.5 while models allow for an increase in transport by a factor of 3. For stadial events a \ntransport effect may explain a factor of 3 higher dust concentrations in Greenland \ncompared to interstadials based on ice core data. For sea salt the transport induced \ninterglacial\/glacial and interstadial\/stadial increase may be somewhat smaller in \nGreenland. In the case of Antarctica, neither data nor model evidence indicate a \nsubstantial shift in transport intensity during the LGM. In Antarctica transport time \nchanges are not supported by the available model results while slightly increased \natmospheric lifetimes may have occurred. \n \nA detailed investigation of ion records from Greenland ice cores presented in this study \nshows that no common linear dependence of logarithmic sea salt and mineral dust \nconcentrations can be assumed across both warm and cold periods. Instead the Ca2+ \nrecord increases more rapidly when temperature conditions fall below a certain threshold. \nHowever, separate linear relationships between sea salt and mineral dust are found both \nfor cold and warm periods. An outcome of this analysis is that the regression parameters \nfor the Holocene and the interstadial regimes are very similar. This suggests that the \ntransport regime for the Holocene and the interstadials may not have differed \nsignificantly, despite the permanent existence of extensive ice sheets during MIS3. Thus, \nwe may conclude that the Laurentide and Fennoscandian ice sheets may have had a \nlimited effect on long-range aerosol transport during warm periods, however, the large \nerror in the Holocene regression parameters asks for further studies in this direction. A \nFISCHER ET AL., DUST AND SEA SALT IN POLAR ICE CORES \n25 \npotential split of the polar jet under conditions of higher baroclinity and higher wind \nspeeds during cold periods is indicated by climate models. This would represent a short \ncut for dust transport onto the Greenland ice sheet and may potentially explain the sudden \nincrease in dust relative to sea salt during stadials. Using the latest high-resolution data \nderived from the North GRIP ice core we were able to show that such a shift from the \nwarm to the cold dust regime occurred in only a few years for the Dansgaard\/Oeschger \nevents 3 and 4. The reasons for this rapid switch may be a rapid response in the source \nstrength (e.g. lack of rainfall, higher windspeeds, increased frequency of dust storm \nevents) or a rapid change in atmospheric transport, as e.g. a sudden split in the polar jet as \ndescribed above. Due to the potential coupling of transport and source emissions by a \nsudden shift in location and intensity of the jet stream a separation of the influences of \nboth effects for stadial\/interstadial transitions is not straightforward. The aerosol \ncomposition in Antarctic ice cores does not reveal a clear linear relationship between \nlogarithmic sea salt and dust fluxes. We conclude that a common transport effect on sea \nsalt and mineral dust is not the dominating process to explain the glacial\/interglacial \nchange in ice core concentrations in Antarctica. \n \nTaking model and data evidence together, we estimate that transport can explain a factor \nof 3-4.5 change for Greenland dust concentrations during the glacial\/interglacial \ntransition and a factor 2-3 during stadial\/interstadial transitions, where the upper limit is \nbased on ice core evidence, while the lower limit summarizes model results. In the case \nof sea salt, the reduced sensitivity of Greenland sea salt concentrations compared to dust \nfor cold climate periods probably implies a reduced transport effect. We estimate this \neffect to explain a factor of 3 change in Greenland sea salt concentrations for the \nglacial\/interglacial transition and a factor 2 for stadial\/interstadial transitions. In \nAntarctica the model results are limited but may potentially explain a factor of 1.5 change \nin aerosol fluxes due to changes in transport and atmospheric life time. \n \nAlthough these estimates of source and transport changes have considerable \nuncertainties, it shows that both processes are important in Greenland, while source \nchanges clearly dominate in Antarctica. A summary of the increases due to emission \nchanges, transport and local deposition on the ice sheet is given in Table 2. Although the \nuncertainties of these best guesses are still large, the observed sea salt increase may be \nexplained when a significant sea ice salt source is included for Antarctica. Note however, \nthat knowledge of such a sea ice salt source is still too limited to draw a final conclusion. \nThe LGM dust increase is clearly underestimated by a factor of about 4 in models. \nIncluding an increase of dust emissions due to higher gustiness by a moderate factor of 2 \nand a glacial expansion of the dust source area in southern South America may bring the \nestimates in line with the ice core observations. For Greenland a similar picture emerges \nwhere estimates and observations converge when a sea ice salt source is considered, \nhowever dust is so far strongly underestimated. Because our estimate for the transport \neffect appears to be on the high side, a significantly stronger change in dust sources is \nnecessary to reconcile model estimates and observations. In the coming years, refined \nmodeling efforts on atmospheric dust and sea salt formation as well as transport during \nglacial times will certainly improve our knowledge. A better representation of the wind \nspeed distribution as well as higher resolution models (increasing local source emissions \nFISCHER ET AL., DUST AND SEA SALT IN POLAR ICE CORES \n26 \nand decreasing the impact of low latitude sources to the polar regions due to an improved \nrepresentation of cyclonic activity) may resolve the discrepancy.  \n \nThe new NorthGRIP ice core has been analyzed continuously using CFA for the time \ninterval from the latest Eemian to the earliest Holocene. Due to the high snow \naccumulation and bottom melting at this site, this core will allow for seasonal resolution \nand stratigraphic dating [Rasmussen et al., 2005] for an extended time span. Also in \nAntarctica two new ice cores have been recently drilled within the framework of the \nEuropean Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica (EPICA). Results from the Dome C ice \ncore over the last 8 glacial cycles [Wolff et al., 2005] have been presented here and data \nfrom the EPICA ice core in Dronning Maud Land are expected soon. The latter \nrepresents the first ice core recording changes in environmental conditions (cyclonic \nactivity, sea ice coverage) in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. Due to its \nproximity to the Patagonian dust source, it will be especially suited to quantify changes in \nthe mineral dust source. In addition the 2-3 times higher snow accumulation at this site \nwill allow us to resolve seasonal variations in both dust and sea salt aerosol at least for \nHolocene conditions [G\u00f6ktas et al., 2002; Sommer et al., 2000]. With respect to the \nrecently identified role of sea ice in the sea salt aerosol budget of Antarctica current (e.g. \nBerkner Island or Siple Dome) and future ice cores from coastal regions will strongly \nenhance our knowledge on regional changes in sea ice coverage. Accordingly, upcoming \nice core records from both polar regions will set new standards of aerosol records in both \ntemporal resolution and coverage and are expected to considerably improve our \nknowledge of aerosol emission and atmospheric transport.  \n \nAcknowledgments: We thank all participants in the field and lab for their commitment in collecting high \naccuracy data under adverse conditions.

This assumption holds also for the aerosol \nconcentration of each individual size class of the aerosol cair(d,t), if we neglect interaction \nof different size classes in the atmosphere. The latter assumption is sufficiently fulfilled if \nwe only treat aerosol in the accumulation and dispersion mode as is the case for sea salt \nand mineral dust. The respective partial differential equation can be written as \n[ ] [ ])(),( 2 tAkdcvvc\ndt\ntddc\nH airwetdryair\nair \u03b5+\u2212=+\u2212=  \nwhere the transport time t=L\/u is dependent on the intensity of atmospheric circulation \n(transport velocity u) and its transport patterns (length of the transport path L), H is the \ntypical height of the scavenged air column, vdry, vwet the dry and wet deposition velocity, \nrespectively. vdry is proportional to the square of the particle diameter d for gravitational \nsettling with k = 8.3 107 m-1s-1 as used in Ruth et al. [2003], while vwet is dependent on the \nprecipitation rate A and the scavenging efficiency \u03b5. We assume that the size fractionating \neffect of wet deposition is negligible compared to that of dry deposition [Ruth et al., \n2003]. Note, that all parameters in this equation may in principle change along the \ntrajectory, however, it is reasonable to assume that the change in the deposition processes \nthemselves (i.e. k, \u03b5, H) is small compared to the change in snow precipitation rate A(t). \nThus, besides cair only the precipitation rate is an explicit function of transport time. The \nequation can be integrated after separation of variables leading to \n\u23a5\u23a6\n\u23a4\u23a2\u23a3\n\u23a1 \u222b\u03b5\u2212\u2212=\nt\nairair dttAH\nt\nH\nkddctdc\n0\n2\n)(exp)0,(),(  \nwith cair(d,0) the air concentration of an individual size class at the source.  \n \nAssuming a lognormal distribution of the initial atmospheric size distribution Pair(lnd) \nwith the maximum of the distribution on a logarithmic scale at diameter \u03bcair \n(subsequently referred to as mode) and width \u03c3air, the size distribution is transformed \nalong the transport route according to  \n( )\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b \u03b5+\u2212\u03c3\n\u03bc\u2212\u2212\u03c3\u03c0= AkdH\ntdPtdP\nair\nair\nair\nair\n2\n0,\n2\n2\n0,\n0,\n0\nlog\n)log(log\n2\n1exp\nlog 2\n),(log   (I) \nwhere \u03bcair,0 and \u03c3air,0 are typical parameters of the dust source, which are assumed to be \nconstant and where we replaced the precipitation rate A(t) en route by its average A.  \nEquation (I) allows us to estimate the transport time t if changes in the size distribution of \nparticular dust are known from ice core measurements.

If we use the measured \nmode of size distribution in the ice (\u03bcLGM=1.6 \u03bcm; \u03bcPB=1.3 \u03bcm) as a first guess for the \natmospheric size distribution and use \u03bcair,0=2.5 \u03bcm, we obtain tLGM\/tPB=0.45. For \nstadial\/interstadial transitions (\u03bcS=1.55 \u03bcm; \u03bcIS=1.2-1.4 \u03bcm, where \u03bcIS is not well \nconstrained [Ruth et al., 2003]) this implies tS\/tIS=0.39-0.69. \nHowever, the above given equations hold for the size distribution of dust in the \natmosphere while for the measured size distribution in ice the enrichment of large \nparticles due to dry deposition has to be considered  \n)( )(log)(log 2 iceairice AkddPdP \u03b5+\u221d  \nThe same analytical determination of the maximum in the size distribution in the ice \nleads to  \n\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b\n\u03b5+\u03bc\n\u03bc\u2212\u03b5+\u03bc\n\u03bc\u03c3\n+\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b\n\u2212\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b\n\u03b5+\u03bc\n\u03bc\u03c3\u2212\u03bc\n\u03bc=\u03bc\n\u03bc\nwarm\nice\nwarm\nice\nwarm\nice\ncold\nice\ncold\nice\ncold\nice\nair\nwarm\nice\ncold\nice\nwarm\ncold\nwarm\nice\nwarm\nice\nwarm\nice\nair\nair\nwarm\nice\nwarm\nice\ncold\nice\nAkAk\nk\nt\nt\nAk\nk\n2\n2\n2\n2\n0,\n2\n2\n2\n2\n0,\n2\n0,\n log 10ln2                   \n...1 log10ln2loglog\n \nWhile this determines tcold\/twarm analytically it is dependent on \u03c3air,0 which again is a \npriori not known. E.g. calculating the change in transport times in the LGM compared to \nthe preboreal (PB) time period (AiceLGM=0.05 mWE\/yr , AicePB=0.2 mWE\/yr , [Cuffey and \nClow, 1997]) this equation leads to tLGM\/tPB=0.81 for \u03c3air,0=4 \u03bcm but tLGM\/tPB=0.51 for \n\u03c3air,0=1.7 \u03bcm (k=83 \u03bcm-1s-1 and \u03b5=1 106 as used in Ruth et al. [2003]). For \nstadial\/interstadial transitions, where we estimated AiceIS=0.1 mWE\/yr  [Cuffey and Clow, \n1997] and using \u03c3air,0=1.7 \u03bcm we obtain tS\/tIS=0.43-0.73 dependent on the choice of \u03bcIS \nbetween 1.2-1.4 \u03bcm.  \nIf we assume that the size distribution at the time of deposition is also approximately \nlognormal, we can also express \u03bcair in terms of \u03bcice with \n log10ln2log 2\n2\n2\niceice\nice\nair\nair\nice\nAk\nk \u03b5+\u03bc\n\u03bc\u03c3=\u03bc\n\u03bc\n \nAgain we need the width of the size distribution in the air, which is not known a priori, \nhowever, the change in the width between ice and air over the ice sheet is small and does \nnot have a strong effect on the result. So in the following we assume that \u03c3air\u2248\u03c3ice.

In this case we obtain the values \nsummarized in Fig. A1 as a function of the mode of the initial size distribution which is \nalso not exactly known a priori. Here we will use \u03bcair,0 =2.5 \u03bcm. Note, however, that \ntcold\/twarm will vary only by \u00b10.05 within reasonable bounds for the mode of the initial size \ndistribution. Using these values we arrive at tLGM\/tPB=0.52 and tS\/tIS=0.43-0.69 dependent \non the value taken to be representative for the mode during interstadials. As a best guess \nwe use tS\/tIS=0.65 at the upper end of the interstadial mode. \n \nReferences \nAlley, R. B., R. C. Finkel, K. Nishiizumi, S. Anandakrishnan, C. A. Shuman, G. \nMershon, G. A.
