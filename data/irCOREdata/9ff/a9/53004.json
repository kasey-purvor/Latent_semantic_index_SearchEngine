Introduction \nDespite the obvious benefits and advantages that ceramic tiled surfaces can yield, a number of \nattendant problems nevertheless exist. In particular, the most prominent problem is that contaminants \ncan enter into, and exit a space via the grout used to fill the void between adjoining ceramic tiles. \nWhat is more, routine cleaning of the tiled surface with detergents, etc. brings about a significant \nreduction in the life of the epoxy tile grout as they are very difficult to clean and become \ncontaminated over time and have to removed physically or mechanically, both of which are arduous \nand costly undertakings. To alleviate these problems associated with commercially available epoxy \ntile grout, a new approach was created by Lawrence et al. [1-3]. This new approach not only \ncomprised of the development of a new grout material termed the amalgamated oxide compound \ngrout (AOCG), but also a new grouting technique whereby a high power diode laser (HPDL) was \nused to glaze an enamel coating on the surface of the AOCG, thus resulting in a two-stage sealing \nprocess. This technique has been developed further by Lawrence et al. [4], resulting in the \ndevelopment of a single-stage sealing process using the HPDL. The new grouting material used \ncrushed vitrified ceramic tiles as a bulk filler with an enamel frit placed directly on top. In this way a \nsingle-stage process could be achieved as theoretically the materials could be applied in a single \naction and only one pass of the HPDL would be required. The seals generated between adjoining \nvitrified ceramic tiles with the single-stage grout were found to be tough and inexpensive, as well as \nproviding an amorphous, crack-free surface glaze. In this way the tiles were sealed together \npermanently, preventing any further contamination activity; in effect creating a completely sealed \nsurface that is both impermeable and relatively simple to clean and maintain since contaminants are \nbasically arrested on the surface of the tile and the glazed seal. Because such a seal would be an \nintegral a part of the surface as the tiles themselves, the necessity to remove old or contaminated \ngrout from the void between the tiles would be eliminated. \nPorosity and microcracking are attendant problems when laser treating the surface of many materials, \nwith the enamel glaze investigated in this study being no exception. It is known, however, that certain \nprocess gasses can go some way to assuage or even eliminate the serious problems of surface porosity \nand microcracking. To this end, work was conducted in order to elucidate the effects of using Ar, O2 \nN2 and He process gasses during the glazing of the enamel surface of the single-stage ceramic tile \n  4 \ngrout seal with a HPDL. The findings showed a marked difference existed in the surface condition of \nthe concrete after HPDL treatment depending on the process gas used. \nInvestigations into the effects of different process gasses during the laser processing of materials have \nhitherto focused mainly on the laser welding and cutting of steels, with other studies examining the \nlaser ablation drilling and surface treatment of numerous metals. These studies have revealed the high \ndegree of influence that the process gas employed has on the process and end results. In both CO2 [5, \n6] and Nd:YAG [7] laser welding of carbon steels it has been observed that greater penetration can be \nachieved if He is used, whilst faster welding rates can be realised if Ar is used. Chung et al [8] \nconcluded that such benefits as increased penetration depth and faster welding speed arising from \nappropriate process selection during laser welding and cutting were due in part to the gasses\u2019 ability, \nor lack of it, for removing plasma plumes. In a study into the influence of process gas type on the \nsurface characteristics of the welds generated on steel with a CO2 laser, Qiang et al. [9] found that the \nprocess gas type significantly affected the surface morphology of the welds. To date, a number of \nworkers have reported on the effects of process gasses during laser drilling [10-14]. In particular, \ndetailed studies by Low et al. [13, 14] revealed that, whereas the use of an O2 process gas typically \ncaused increased liquid particle ejection coupled with volatile burning, the use of an Ar process \ninduced material ejection predominantly by bulk radial liquid ejection. \n2. Development of the single-stage ceramic tile grout \nCommercially available epoxy tile grout is currently formulated from four main components: acrylic \nemulsion, limestone, dolomite and a cellulose substance. It is well established that glazing can only \nbe achieved using materials containing at least some of the essential glass network forming \ncompounds such as SiO2 and BO3, along with some glass network modifying and intermediate \ncompounds such as Na2O, Al2O and MgO [15]. As such, it proved impossible to directly glaze epoxy \ntile grouts [1-3]. Also, the coating of epoxy tile grout with a vitrifiable substance was not possible \nsince the actual bonding mechanism by which the grout adheres to surfaces to which it is applied is \nmechanical, or more precisely hydraulic, and is achieved as a result of the acrylic emulsion \nhydraulically bonding to the surface [16]. Since the grout does not bond to surfaces chemically, it is \nunable to withstand elevated temperatures. Indeed, at temperatures above 200\n0\nC the grout will \n  5 \nactually de-bond from the surface it is applied to [17], a temperature well below the softening point \nof commercial vitreous coating materials. \nBased on the findings of previous work conducted by Lawrence et al. [1-3] in which a two-stage \nceramic tile grout sealing process was developed, research was undertaken to devise a single-stage \nprocess [4]. But initial attempts to generate a single-stage seal using a selection of oxide compound \npowders and a commercially available enamel frit consistently resulted in unsatisfactory glazes, with \nmicrocracking and porosity generation to varying degrees, as well as inconsistent glazing being ever \npresent features. However, the adoption of a new approach yielded more acceptable results. Whereas \npreviously the compounds and the enamel frit were combined together to form a single amalgamated \nmixture, the new approach specifically kept the compounds and the enamel frit apart. Yet work \nconducted previously by Lawrence et al.[1-3, 18, 19] revealed that in order for the enamel frit to wet \nand bond to the compound mixtures, HPDL surface treatment of the compound mixtures was \nnecessary (so as to generate a vitrified surface) prior to the application of the enamel frit. The \nsolution found for this problem was to use crushed vitrified ceramic tiles as a bulk filler, since the \nenamel frit will readily wet this material without the need for prior HPDL surface treatment, with the \nenamel frit placed directly on top as shown in Fig. 1. In this way a single-stage process could be \nachieved as theoretically the materials could be applied in a single action and only one pass of the \nHPDL would be required. \n3. Experimental procedures \nThe experiments were carried out using UK standard 150 x 150 x 5 mm\n3\n vitrified ceramic tiles of \nvarious colours: white, navy blue, leaf green and jet black, cut into smaller pieces, 20 x 20 mm\n2\n, for \nexperimental purposes and applied in pairs to an ordinary Portland cement (OPC) substrate using \nstandard epoxy tile grout (Vallance Ltd). The spacing between the vitrified edges of each tile pair \nwas the industry recommended 1.5 mm. The fixed ceramic tile pieces were then allowed to set for the \nstandard setting time of one day. Vitrified ceramic tiles were crushed and fine ground using a pestle \nand mortar and then sieved to ensure a particle size of less than 45 \u00b5m. So as to form a manageable \npaste, the vitrified ceramic tile powder was mixed with approximately 50wt% water diluted sodium \nsilicate solution. The vitrified ceramic tile paste was then placed into the void, flush to the surface of \n  6 \nthe tiles and allowed to cure for 8 h. The set mixture was then overlaid directly with a thin layer    \n(500 \u00b5m) of enamel frit (Ferro Group (UK) Ltd.) which, in order to form a manageable paste, was \nmixed with 20wt% white spirit. The composition of the enamel consisted mainly of the following: \nSiO2, B2O3, Na2O, Mn and small quantities of Ba, Al2O3 and Ni, whilst the powder size was \napproximately 25 \u00b5m. The enamel frit paste was allowed to cure for 1 h whereupon it was irradiated \nimmediately with the defocused HPDL beam. \nThe laser employed in this work was a HPDL (Diomed Ltd.) emitting at 810 nm \u00b120 nm with a \nmaximum output power of 60 W. The HPDL beam was delivered to the work area by means of a 4 m \nlong, 600 \u00b5m core diameter optical fibre, the end of which was connected to a 2:1 focusing lens \nassembly. The laser was operated in the continuous wave (CW) mode and produced a multi-mode \nbeam. The HPDL operating parameters were arranged such that the power density of the defocused \nbeam ranged from 0.75-3 kW cm\n-2\n. The HPDL beam was fired across the surface of the enamel frit by \ntraversing the samples beneath the beam using the x- and y-axis of a CNC gantry table at a speeds \nranging from 180-600 mm min\n-1\n, as depicted in Fig. 2.  \nSo as to study the effects of different process gasses, coaxially blown gas jets of O2, Ar N2 and He \nwere applied at a rate of 8 l min\n-1\n. In order to examine the effects of the different gasses on the \nenamel surface glaze of the single-stage ceramic tile grout seal, in particular their influence on the \ncooling rates of the glaze, the temperatures obtained with the four different process gasses were \nmeasured using a Cyclops infrared thermometer (Minolta Ltd.) connected to a PC. As one can see \nfrom Fig. 2, the infrared thermometer was arranged such that only the temperatures of the melt pool \ngenerated as a result of the HPDL beam impinging on the surface of the enamel frit were measured. \nThe physical characteristics of the cracks observed on the surface of the HPDL generated enamel \nglazes when using the four different process gasses were determined using an optical profiling system \n(ProScan) and analysed by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM). \n4. Results \nThe surface morphologies of the glazes produced using the HPDL with the various process gasses \nwere found to contrast markedly depending upon the gas type. Fig. 3 shows a typical optical surface \n  7 \nview of the HPDL generated enamel glaze when employing (a) O2, (b) Ar, (c) N2 and (d) He process \ngasses. As is apparent from Fig. 3, the use of O2 as the process gas resulted in surface glazes that \nexhibited far fewer microcracks and porosities than those generated with either Ar , N2 or He process \ngasses. Moreover, as one can see from Fig 3(a), the enamel glaze generated when using an O2 process \ngas appears to have very few microcracks and no porosities. Conversely, the enamel glaze generated \nwhen He was employed as the process gas can be seen to posses a great many microcracks and \nnumerous porosities (Fig. 3(d)). The enamel glazes produced when using both Ar and N2 process \ngasses appear similar (Fig. 3(b) and Fig. 3(c)), although the number of microcracks and porosities \npresent are much less than when a He process gas was used.  \nThe physical characteristics of the cracks in terms of density per square cm, length, depth and width \nfor the four different process gasses at fixed laser operating parameters are given in Table 1. As is \nevident from Table 1, the crack density obtained when an O2 process gas is employed is very much \nlower than when using a He process gas, whilst the crack densities obtained when using Ar and N2 \nprocess gasses lie in between the two and are similar to one another. This tendency is repeated to a \ncertain degree for the length, depth and width of the cracks, but not with similar magnitude. It is \ninteresting to note that despite being similar in number, the cracks produced when using the N2 \nprocess gas are larger than those seen when Ar was employed. To examine further the effects of \nprocess gas on crack formation, the differences in crack formation as a function of process gas and \nlaser parameters are detailed in Fig. 4. As is perhaps to be expected, Fig. 4 shows that the crack \ndensity per square cm is influenced by the laser power employed, increasing as the laser power \nincreases. However, the crack density per square cm follows the same trend identified in Table 1 \nregardless of laser power.  \nThe findings of the study to measure the temperatures on the surface of the HPDL generated enamel \nglaze when the selected process gasses were employed are shown graphically in Fig. 5. As can be \nseen clearly from Fig. 5, the recorded cooling rate of the enamel glaze surface under a He process gas \nafter the HPDL beam has been removed was slightly faster than that when either Ar or N2 was used \nas the process gas. But, perhaps more importantly, Fig. 5 shows that a cooling rate considerably \nslower than those occasioned by the use of either Ar, N2 or He as the process gas resulted from \nemploying an O2 process gas. \n  8 \n5. Discussion \nAn analysis of the results obtained from the experiments conducted showed clearly that the quality of \nthe enamel glazes produced, in terms of porosity and microcracks, was greatly influenced by the type \nof process gas employed. In particular, the density per square cm of the cracks resulting from the use \nof He as the process gas was found to be greater than when either Ar or N2 were employed, and much \ngreater than when O2 was used. This marked contrast could be attributed in part to the fact that, due \nto of its relatively open structure, it is possible for gasses to dissolve molecularly in glasses and, if the \ngas molecule is small enough, it can diffuse rapidly in a simple glass such as fused silica [15]. Indeed, \ngasses such as H2 and O2 are known to dissolve molecularly in glass and can also react with the glass \nnetwork [15]. The use of O2 as the process gas significantly reduced the number of microcracks and \nporosities within the enamel glaze. This implies that the O2 interacted with the glass network \nincreasing the heat generation and subsequently the fluidity of the melt. In contrast, the He did not \ninteract with the glass network and was consequently trapped within the more viscous melt in the \nform of bubbles. Indeed, it is believed that mechanism behind the formation of porosities on the \nsurface of the HPDL generated enamel glazes is the outcome of O2 gas escaping from within the melt \nand disrupting the surface [20]. The O2 is formed naturally and released during the vitrification \nreaction [21]. If the molten surface of the enamel lacks sufficient fluidity, as is the case when a He \nprocess gas is used, then because of the high viscosity of the melt, the generated O2 can not escape \nfrom the molten enamel surface easily. As such, when the O2 eventually does penetrate the melt \nsurface, the resultant porosity is not filled by the flow of the melt since the cooling rate induced by \nthe He is insufficient to maintain a high enough temperature for an adequate length of time and thus \ndecrease the overall viscosity of the melt [22]. On the other hand, when employing an O2 process gas, \nthe inherent O2 gas bubbles generated during the vitrification of the enamel frit escape from the melt \nmore readily due to its lower viscosity, thus reducing the number of porosities. Indeed, as the cooling \nrate curves for the HPDL treated enamel glaze surface shown in Fig. 5 indicate, when the HPDL \nbeam was removed, the cooling of the enamel glaze was faster when a He process gas was employed \nas opposed to an O2 process gas. Therefore, the length of time that the surface of the enamel glaze is \nof a sufficient fluidity to allow the generated gas bubbles to escape the surface easily is much \nreduced, resulting in porosities and microcracks. \n  9 \nThe direct effect of the cooling rate of the HPDL generated enamel melt is almost certainly an \ninfluential factor governing the resultant surface condition of the enamel glaze itself. A correlation \nbetween the cooling rate brought about by the use of a particular process gas and the number and size \nof the resulting microcracks is clearly evident from a comparison of the cooling rate curves shown in \nFig. 5 and the crack details given in Table 1. If the two extremes are considered then it would appear \nthat the much faster cooling rate occasioned by the use of He as the process gas, rather than O2, \nresults in an enamel glaze with 6-times as many cracks. This is borne out somewhat when one \nconsiders that He is known to effect a faster rate of cooling than O2, as well as Ar and N2 [14, 16, 23]. \nFurther, a number of workers [24-28] have determined that the \u2018reactiveness\u2019 of O2 means that when \nit is used as a process gas, exothermic reactions take place which cause additional heating within a \nmelt. It is interesting to note that although N2 is inert, it is known to react very easily with Fe [29] \nwhich is present in reasonable quantities within the enamel frit. Despite this, however, it would \nappear from Fig. 5 that this reactiveness was not sufficient to reduce the cooling rate of the molten \nenamel to such a level whereby microcracking was avoided. Clearly, the tendency of the HPDL \ninduced enamel glaze to crack will be reduced if the cooling rate of the molten enamel is reduced. \nThis is principally because a high cooling rate inherently induces thermal stresses which in turn can \nlead to crack development in order to relieve the generated thermal stresses. This is due to the fact \nthat the enamel has a low thermal conductivity and, as such, during HPDL heating a large thermal \ngradient between the melt zone and the substrate exists which results in thermal stresses. \nAdditionally, despite the fact that the process of HPDL firing the enamel frit results from a high \nspecific rate of energy which in turn facilitates localised melting of the enamel frit, the fact that a \ncertain amount of the heat will be conducted to sections of the seal where the enamel is already \nglazed, combined with existence of a relatively cold crushed ceramic tile substrate, means that \nthermal stresses will be generated. During the heating phase the stresses will be compressive and \nrelieved by plastic deformation, thus precluding crack formation. At high temperatures where the \ntemperature, T, is greater than or equal to the melting temperature of the enamel frit, Tm, the stresses \ncan also be relieved [30-32]. However, during cooling when the temperature falls below Tm, then \nstresses will accumulate. If the fracture strength of the material is exceeded, then cracking within the \nmelted layer will occur. \n  10 \nIt can be seen from Table 1 that the physical characteristics of the microcracks produced on the \nsurface of the HPDL generated enamel glaze differed depending on the choice of process gas. Table 1 \nshows clearly that the most severe microcracking occurs when a He process gas is used. But what is \nworthy of note, however, is the typical occurrence of microcracking within the enamel glaze that was \nboth parallel and perpendicular to the surface when a He process gas was employed (see Fig. 6). Such \nfindings are in accord with the nature of the tensile stresses produced during cooling of the \nsolidifying layer in terms of the glazed layer section thickness. During cooling of a relatively thin \nglazed layer, the temperature is almost uniform across the section, therefore it only experiences a \ntwo-dimensional stress at the surface. But for relatively thick section glazes, as is the case in question \nhere, the temperature gradient across the depth is present along with the gradients at the surface. \nConsequently the three-dimensional nature of the stresses produces microcracks that are both \nperpendicular and parallel to the surface [22, 32]. Such instances of microcracking perpendicular and \nparallel to the surface were not observed when employing O2, Ar or N2 process gasses, indicating that \nthe stresses induced in the enamel glaze as a result of cooling rate were much less. \n6. Conclusions \nThe effects of using O2, Ar, N2 and He process gasses during the firing of a vitreous enamel to form a \nsingle-stage ceramic tile grout seal with a high power diode laser (HPDL) have been studied. The \nfindings revealed distinct differences in the surface condition of the HPDL generated enamel glaze \ndepending upon the process gas used. The use of O2 as the process gas was seen to result in glazes \nwith far fewer microcracks and porosities than those generated with any of the other three gasses, \nespecially He process gasses. Such differences were found to be due in part to the ability of the \nsmaller O2 gas molecules to dissolve molecularly into the open structure of the HPDL generated \nenamel glaze and subsequently react with the glass network to increase the fluidity of the melt. Of \nfurther influence is the inherent reactiveness of O2 which consequently effects exothermic reactions \nwhen it is used as a process gas, thereby causing additional heating within the melt. Both occurrences \nwere seen, in turn, to affect the cooling rate and therefore the tendency of the molten glaze to \ngenerate microcracks when cooled. \n  11 \nAcknowledgements \nThe authors would like to express their gratitude to the EPSRC: Process Engineering Group (Grant \nNo. GR\/M46068) for their financial support of this work.
