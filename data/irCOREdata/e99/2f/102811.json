INTRODUCTION \nSatellite networks will form part of the future global \nnetwork infrastructure. One of the key issues for their design \nand commercial success is the achieved level of integration \nwith the terrestrial networks. In the light of the IP dominance \nin current data networking, broadband satellite networks can \nbe regarded as subnets over which TCP\/IP has to be optimally \nsupported. In this context, analytical methods for studying the \nbehavior of TCP\/IP flows over satellite networks are valuable. \nTwo main trends have emerged during the last years with \nregard to the analytical modeling of TCP\/IP networks. \nProcessor-sharing models [1]-[3] provide effectively an \nabstraction of the TCP-controlled bandwidth sharing that is \nperformed in individual links. With the partial exception of \n[1], actual engineering details of the protocol are ignored. The \nmodels address the behavior of the protocol at the flow-\n\/connection-level, without providing insight to the packet-\nlevel dynamics of the traffic such as buffer queues and losses. \nThe most attractive property of PS-based models is their \ninsensitivity property: the model outcome is not dependent on \nthe actual distribution of connection arrivals or transferred file \nsizes but only on their mean. This property enables the \ngeneralization of solutions derived under Markovian theory to \nthe more realistic cases of power-tail distributions, which are \nreported in literature for TCP traffic features. \nIn our study, we rather focus on the second approach that \nmakes use of fixed-point methods. Contrary to the PS-based \nmodels, fixed point-methods feature separate, explicit models \nfor the TCP source and the resource (network element-router) \nthat are coupled with each-other: the TCP send rate is an \nexplicit function of the loss and delay experienced by the \nconnection in the network nodes [4]-[6], which are in turn a \nfunction of the TCP send rates via the resource models. \nClassical queuing models such as the M\/D\/1\/K or the \nM\/M\/1\/K model in [7]-[9], as well as Active Queue \nManagement (AQM) models [10], [11] have been investigated \nas resource models. In this paper, we describe a fixed-point \nmethod for analyzing TCP performance over satellite \nnetworks. Our starting point is the vector-based representation \nin [7] addressing terrestrial wired networks. We generalize \ntheir formulation regarding two aspects that have to be \nconsidered when addressing satellite networks, although they \nare not limited to them, i.e. path and\/or bandwidth asymmetry \nand the existence of broadcast and MAC-shared links. \nThe paper is organized as follows. Section II describes our \ngeneric method and its application to the specific instance of \nBandwidth on Demand (BoD) satellite links. In section III we \noutline the analytical models used at the TCP source and \nsatellite link level, whereas in section IV we evaluate the \nmethod via ns2 simulations and discuss the simulation results. \nWe conclude our study in section V with some comments on \nthe method limitations. \nII. METHOD DESCRIPTION \nLet L be the set of network links and R be the set of routes \n(paths) of the TCP connections, corresponding to subsets ir  of \nL. If M and N are the cardinalities of the two sets, i.e. M = |L| \nand N =|R|, then we can define two N x M routing matrices \nFA  and RA , one for the forward path of the connection and \none for the reverse (ACK packets path). Their elements \nR\nij\nF\nij aa ,  equal unity when the link j, j \u2208 L is included in the \nforward\/reverse connection path i respectively, Ri \u2208 , and 0 \notherwise: \n \n\uf8f3\uf8f2\n\uf8f1\n\u2209\n\u2208\n=\ni\niRF\nij rjif\nrjif\na\n0\n1)(    (1) \nWe also define the vectors c = (cj) and d = (dj) to denote \nthe capacities of the network links and the one-way \npropagation delays related to them, respectively. Then the \nround-trip-times of the N paths t = (ti) can be written as a \nfunction of queuing delays at the output buffers of the links dq \n= (dqj) and the component of total path delay that is related to \nthe propagation delays pt  = (\np\nit ) as \n ( ) ( ) dqAAtdqdAAt RFpRF \u22c5++=+\u22c5+= )(         (2) \n0-7803-8533-0\/04\/$20.00 (c) 2004 IEEEIEEE Communications Society 3968\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

The term ljq  is the loss probability related to \nlink errors. In order to make the analysis feasible, the \nassumption of independent losses at each link is invoked, so \nthat, if 1 is a vector of appropriate size (here: N) whose \ncomponents are all equal to 1, the path losses experienced by \nthe TCP senders on the connection paths may be written \n                                                           \n1 a single network node may be related to more than one queues, one per \noutput link \n ( )q1A1p F \u2212\u22c5\u2212= .                         (9) \nThe TCP window is then dictated by the queuing losses \n( cjq ) and the link errors (\nl\njq ) encountered at each link on the \nconnection path and the limitations set by the buffer \navailability at the receiver peer or the application, maxW  (3)-\n(4). \nThe medium access controlled links need particular \nattention in order to be accommodated in this framework: with \nregard to queuing delay\/loss they can be regarded as the \ndistributed equivalent of a single conventional multiplexer, i.e. \nas a single distributed switch. On the contrary, with regard to \nlink errors a shared link corresponds to many point-to-point \nlinks due to the physical separation of the sender-receiver \npairs. \nOne way to expand the described vector representation so \nthat it can accommodate MAC controlled links is to slightly \nmodify (6), (8) and (9). For the MAC-shared link sj , (8) and \n(9), under realistically small loss rates, may be rewritten as: \n );( cbfqq\ns\nss\nj\nl\nc\njj ==                    (10) \nand  ( ) lF pq1A1p +\u2212\u22c5\u2212=                    (11) \nrespectively and the factors accounting for the successive \ntraffic thinning on its path are written \n( ) ( ) ( )\n( )\n( ) ( ) ( )\n( )\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f1\n>\u2229\u2208\u2212\u2212\n\u2264\u2229\u2208\u2212\n= \u220f\n\u220f\n<\u2032\u2208\u2032\n\u2032\n<\u2032\u2208\u2032\n\u2032\n.0\n,,1\n,,1\n,),(:\n,),(:\n,\notherwise\nijposijposrjifpq\nijposijposrjifq\nv\nijposijposrj\ns\ni\nl\nij\nijposijposrj\ns\nij\nRF\nij\ni\ni\nIn other words, the link error probabilities at the shared link \nare separated from the link congestion losses and are added at \nconnection (i.e. path) level as separate terms. These \nadaptations are applicable when there is a single MAC-shared \nlink on the connections\u2019 paths or, equivalently, when other \nMAC-shared links, e.g. Ethernet network at the TCP \nserver\/client side, do not introduce link errors. \nA. Split connections \nTo allow the fixed-point method to account for the split-\nTCP mechanism, the elements Rij\nF\nij aa ,  of the new routing \nmatrices FA  and RA  can be defined as: \n ( ) ( ) 1AA RF \u22c5== jkjj \u03b4:,:,                    (12) \nwhere k is the index of the satellite link, jk\u03b4  is the Kronecker \nDelta and the elements wi and maxiW  are replaced by the \nrespective values in the satellite portion of the connection. The \nassumption behind this modification is that the satellite \ncomponent of the connection determines the actual connection \nthroughput. In general, its validity is dependent on the relative \nvalues of the actual throughputs achieved by the individual \nconnection components \u2013hence on all those factors affecting \nthe throughput, such as RTT, delay\/losses, enabled options in \neach of the connection components [12]. It holds as far as the \nthroughput of the terrestrial component of the split connection \nis at least such that it does not let the satellite component \nstarve. \n0-7803-8533-0\/04\/$20.00 (c) 2004 IEEEIEEE Communications Society 3969\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Application to bottleneck BoD-shared links \nWe consider in the following the application of this generic \nformulation in the context of links shared according to BoD \nmechanisms. The latter are deemed mandatory in satellite \nnetworks for achieving a trade-off between resource utilization \nand traffic handling efficiency, in particular under non-\naggregate, bursty TCP traffic. We assume that the bottleneck \nlink is the shared satellite link, neglecting the delays incurring \nat the other links. We also investigate cases featuring no loss \nat the intermediate nodes; the control signal for TCP in our \ncontext is the delay experienced at the MAC level of the \nshared satellite link. In comparison with the generic problem \nformulation \n jksatj dqdq \u03b4\u22c5=                            (13) \nand 1AA RF == )(:,)(:, kk  \nIf we replace the shared link index k with sat, (7) yields \n( ) \uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n\uf8eb \u22c5\n+\u22c5= \u2211\n=\nsat\nN\ni\ni\nTCP\ni\ni\nACK\niiiii\nsat\ndsat cm\num\ntpnWSRfdq ,1,,,\n1\nmax (14) \nhence, the MAC delay at the satellite link as well as the total \nload offered to the satellite link bsat are obtained via solution of \nthe fixed-point equation (14). The missing elements in these \nequations are the models\/formulas that relate the MAC access \ndelay dqsat, at the shared satellite link of bandwidth csat with \nthe aggregate send rate of TCP sources. This is the subject of \nthe following section. \nIII. TCP SOURCE AND RESOURCE MODELS \nA. The BoD-shared link model \nThere is a bulk of papers on the analysis of packet satellite \nMAC protocols \u2013 the interested reader is referred to [13] for a \ncomprehensive summary. Their applicability to the fixed-point \napproximations we describe depends on the actual treatment of \nTCP traffic in the satellite network and no strict rules apply \nthere. The resource (bandwidth) allocation mechanisms may \ndiffer depending on factors such as: \n\u2022 the traffic aggregation level, namely the number of \nconnections per MAC protocol entity: Higher levels of \naggregation render reservation protocols more relevant, \nwhereas at low levels of traffic these protocols penalize \nresource utilization \n\u2022 type of connections: connections may be short (\u201cmice\u201d) or \nlonger (\u201celephants\u201d). Short connections result in more \ndynamic load variation for the same average number of \nconnections, hence they favor dynamic reservation \nprotocols \n\u2022 the satellite network QoS policy: an operator has to resolve \na trade-off between the QoS guarantees provided to the \nTCP flows and the resource utilization efficiency \n\u2022 the loading of the network: adaptive protocols might alter \nthe way they treat TCP traffic according to the resource \navailability \nIn the following, we are going to focus on dynamic \nassignment protocols, where the resource allocation is made in \nresponse to requests corresponding to the instantaneous traffic \ndemand (buffer occupation) or is distributed, when spare, \namong active terminals. These types of protocols are more \nsuited to low levels of traffic aggregation, corresponding to \nend-users for example, but they are also a possible approach \nfor higher levels of traffic aggregation, in particular under less \nstrict network QoS commitments and \u201cmice\u201d TCP \nconnections. In this context, the most relevant analytical study \nwe are aware of is the analysis provided in [14] for a member \nof the CFDAMA protocol family, the one with pre-assigned \nrequest slots. \nThe load produced by each terminal follows the Poisson \ndistribution with frame arrival rate \u03bb per time slot. The \nrequests are processed by an on-board scheduler. The frame \nlength is larger than the one hop-delay R (measured in slots). \nThe basic analysis provided therein first solves a fixed-point \nequation for the average percentage of frame slots that are \ndemand-assigned and then estimates the MAC delay in terms \nof long series of summed terms, resulting in a high \ncomputational burden. However the authors exploit the \ndependence of the protocol performance on the terminal \npopulation and suggest a much simpler, closed-form, \napproximation for the case of low terminal population N. The \nlatter is quantified via the normalized terminal population \nR\nN\nT =\u03b7 . For 1<<T\u03b7 , the CFDAMA scheme was modeled as \nan M\/G\/1 queue with a geometric service discipline. The \naverage access delay T was derived to be \n ( )( )N\nNNNdqT sat\n\u22c5\u2212\u22c5\n\u2212\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\n+== \u03bb\n\u03bb\n12\n12              (15) \nB. The TCP source model \n1) Link errors: Analytical models for TCP have addressed the \ntwo main metrics that are of interest for TCP connections, \nTCP throughput and TCP latency. Expressions for throughput \nare provided in [4], the square root p formula, and [5], \nhereafter called PFTK formula from the initials of the paper\u2019s \nauthors. Throughput becomes more relevant for long transfers, \nwhere the impact of the Slow Start phase is less significant. \nThe implicit assumption in the derivation of formulas is that \nthe connections are of infinite duration (persistent TCP \nconnections). The main improvement of the PFTK formula \nover the simpler square root p formula is the modeling of \ntimeouts, which allows it to be more accurate at higher error \nrates when timeouts are more probable. Neither of the two \nformulas addresses the Slow Start or the Fast Recovery phases \nof the TCP congestion control algorithm. \nThe TCP latency, namely the time required for the \ncompletion of a TCP transfer, is modeled in [6]. The model, \nhereafter called CSA formula from the authors\u2019 initials, \naccounts for the Slow Start phase and assumes finite transfer \nsize, i.e. the size of the transfer (in bytes\/segments) is one of \nthe explicit inputs to the model. The model is better suited to \nsmall (\u201cmice\u201d) transfers that spend a considerable amount of \ntheir lifetime in Slow Start. \n2) Error free links: In the case of error-free links, the steady-\nstate throughput expression is simplified to (16) \n0-7803-8533-0\/04\/$20.00 (c) 2004 IEEEIEEE Communications Society 3970\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

METHOD VALIDATION \nSimulations with ns2 simulator were performed in order to \nassess the accuracy of the method predictions. Our BoD-\nspecific extensions to the simulator are described in [16]. The \nsimulation scenario is depicted in Fig. 1. Periodically, and as \nlong as new packets arrive at their queues, the BoD entities, \nphysically located in satellite terminals and serving one or \nmore data flows, submit requests to a BoD Controller residing \non-board the satellite. The Controller takes requests into \nconsideration, builds the burst time plan (BTP) and broadcasts \nit to the BoD entities. Both functions are repeated with a \nperiod equal to an integer number of TDMA frames (resource \nallocation period). Requests are submitted in pre-assigned \nslots. \nThe BTP corresponding to requests submitted within a certain \nallocation period is activated by the Entities after an integer \nnumber of resource allocation periods (system response time), \nallowing for the propagation and processing delays at the \nterminals and the Controller. Requests that cannot be satisfied \nin the corresponding allocation period are stored and served \nwith priority in the next resource allocation period. Spare \ncapacity (free slots) is distributed prioritizing entities that have \nnot submitted a request in the respective resource allocation \nperiod on a round-robin basis. A more detailed description of \nthe actual BoD implementation is given in [17]. For the results \nreported subsequently, the link capacity was 2.048Mb\/s, the \nresource allocation period (RAP) was set to 4 TDMA frames \nof 128 slots and 24ms time duration each, yielding a system \nresponse time of 5 RAPs. \nTCP NewReno has been taken as a reference for the \nsimulations with a TCP segment size of 526 bytes and the \ntimestamp option activated. Our first set of simulations \naddresses persistent TCP connections.

The method is assessed assuming both error-prone and \nerror-free satellite links. The second simulation set \ninvestigates the method applicability to the finite transfer size \ncase. The focus in all simulation runs is on mean connection \nthroughput for persistent TCP flows and TCP latency, when \nfinite duration flows are considered. \nA. Infinite duration flows (persistent connections) \n1) Error free links \u2013 single TCP connection per BoD entity: \nFig. 2 compares the throughput predicted by the analytical \nmethod against the simulation results for different TCP \nmaximum buffer size values. There is close agreement for \nhigh link loads, where the TCP throughput is limited by the \navailability of link capacity, i.e. the satellite link is the actual \nbottleneck. The accuracy of the method is less at moderate\/low \nload and improves when the Wmax constraint becomes active \n(8kB and 16kB). The deviation of the analytical estimates \nfrom the simulations results is due to the TCP burstiness. For \nlow load Eq. (16), derived under the assumption of Poisson \narrivals, predicts a much lower delay than the one actually \nsuffered from TCP segments\/ACK packets, resulting in higher \nestimates about TCP throughput. \nThe accuracy of the method increases again at very low \nload, when few connections with small Wmax values share the \nsatellite link. The access delay approaches zero and the \neffective round-trip time of the TCP connection almost \ncoincides with the propagation delay. Note that the agreement \nis good for Wmax equal to 8 and 16kB but it is not for 32kB \n(and above). In that case, the connection is aggressive enough \nto give rise to non-negligible access delays and generate \nmismatch between the model estimate in (15) and the real \naccess delay experienced by TCP segments. \n2) Error free links \u2013 multiple TCP connections per BoD entity: \nIn this set of simulations we varied the number of connections \nthat are treated per BoD entity. The BoD entity still submits \nrequests to the Controller on the basis of the MAC buffer \noccupancy but now queues carry the packets from a variable \nnumber of TCP connections.  \n____ : theory        ------: simulation \n0 10 20 30 40 50 600\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5 x 10\n5\nTCP connections\nTC\nP \nth\nro\nug\nhp\nut\n (b\n\/s)\nWmax 8kB\nWmax 16kB\nWmax 32kB\n \nFig. 2.

TCP throughput versus number of connections \u2013 four BoD entities, \nmultiple TCP connections per entity, no link errors \nThe trend is not significantly different than in the single \nconnection per entity scenario (Fig. 3). Again the agreement is \ncloser at higher load and at very low load, where the limiting \nfactor upon the connection throughput is not the bandwidth \navailability but the maximum window constraint. Apparently, \nat moderate load levels and for the plotted levels of \naggregation the TCP burstiness remains significant so that the \nTCP packet arrivals are distinctively different than Poisson \narrivals. \n3) Link errors: The simulation results are compared against \nthe analytical estimates relying on both TCP throughput \nformulas, the square root p and the PFTK. The agreement is \ncloser in the second case (Fig. 4), since the connections were \nsubject to rather high error rate \u2212MAC frame error rate (FER) \nequal to 10-3\u2212 where timeouts are non-negligible events. \nThe analytical method captures the impact of the Wmax \nconstraint but overall the deviation from the simulation results \nis higher when compared with the error-free links scenario. \nThe reason is that now the link is saturated for a much higher \nnumber of connections than in the error-free links case, since \nconnections are hard-limited by the link errors rather than the \nbandwidth availability almost throughout the offered load \nrange, in terms of numbers of TCP connections sharing the \nlink.  \nB. Finite duration flows \nRegarding simulations, TCP flows arrive according to a \nPoisson process, whereas the connection duration is assumed \nexponential and is varied to give rise to different traffic load \nover the satellite link. The comparisons with the analysis were \nperformed via a Monte Carlo technique, similar to the one \ndescribed in [8]: for each value of the mean number of \nconnections sharing the satellite link, we perform 500 \ncomputations, each one with a different sample Ns. The \ndistribution of Ns should resemble the actual distribution of \nactive connection over the satellite link. We tested two cases \nfor this distribution: the Poisson distribution, corresponding to \nthe M\/G\/\u221e model for connection arrivals [18] and the \ngeometric distribution. \n \n____ : square-root p    ----- : PFTK    -.-.-.-. : simulation \n0 10 20 30 40 50 602\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14 x 10\n4\nTC\nP \nth\nro\nug\nhp\nut\n (b\n\/s)\nTCP connections\nWmax 8kB\nWmax 16kB\nWmax 32kB\n \nFig. 4.

SUMMARY-CONCLUSIONS \nOur paper describes a fixed-point method for the analytical \ninvestigation of the performance of TCP flows in \ngeostationary satellite networks. The method formulation \ncaters for several features of these networks such as \nasymmetry, broadcast and MAC-shared links, split-TCP \nconnections. The method was applied to the particular case of \nMAC-shared satellite links with dynamic bandwidth allocation \nmechanisms, under different scenarios addressing the impact \nof link errors, traffic aggregation at the satellite gateway nodes \nand TCP connection type (short or long). \nThe weakest link in the method chain appears to be the \nsatellite MAC protocol model. Most of the analytical studies \nin literature in this area assume infinite \/ finite terminal \npopulation producing Poisson packet arrivals (or \u201csister\u201d \ndistributions\u2212 e.g. Bernoulli trials). These models cannot cater \nfor the TCP burstiness. Nevertheless, the analytical estimates \nof the method are precise at high load ranges and can capture \nsome fundamental dynamics of TCP performance (e.g. Wmax \nlimitations). Unfortunately, the ultimate limitations to the \nmethod applicability have to do with the lack of models \naddressing the non-homogeneous traffic load case and the \ntraffic prioritization mechanisms at the MAC layer. \n \nREFERENCES \n \n[1] D.P.
