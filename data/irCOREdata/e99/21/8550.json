This paper explores the pattern and pace of a sample of exporting \nTNC subsidiaries operating in the electronics industry in Thailand.  The analysis \nreveals a wide variety in capability building approaches through time, with some \nsubsidiaries failing to develop capabilities and remaining as \u2018assembly only\u2019 plants.  \nOther more dynamic plants developed process engineering and product design skills, \ninvesting heavily in capability building.  One common determinant in capability \nbuilding appears to be the overall technology strategy of the parent plant.  In those \nsubsidiaries which did not upgrade beyond assembly, technology decisions and \nprocesses were tightly controlled within the parent headquarter (HQ) locations.  By \ncontrast, the more dynamic plants exercised more discretion over local capability \nbuilding.  The latter were relatively decentralised and more open to policies to \nencourage upgrading.  The study suggests that governments should tailor upgrading \npolicies not only according to the approximate level of capabilities attained by local \nsubsidiaries, but also according to how receptive firms are to upgrading, arguing that \ncapability building and policy receptiveness go hand-in-hand.  Other countries hoping \nto upgrade the quality of foreign direct investment might also wish to focus policies \non the more technologically capable, ambitious and receptive categories of foreign \nsubsidiary. \n \n \n 3 \nIntroduction \n \nResearch indicates the importance of foreign direct investment (FDI) to the export led \ngrowth and technological catching up in several of Asia\u2019s newly industrialising \neconomies (NIEs).  Some transnational corporation (TNC) subsidiaries in countries \nsuch as Singapore and Malaysia have made considerable progress in upgrading their \ntechnological activities over time.  This progress is sometimes presented in \u2018stages\u2019 \nmodels which try to capture the overall historical progress of TNCs in regions such as \nSouth East Asia.  However, innovation studies in both developed and developing \ncountries consistently show that \u2018all firms are not the same\u2019 in their strategies and \npractices towards technology.  Therefore, there is no reason to assume that all firms \nwill upgrade technologically through stages.  Nor is there any reason to assume that \nupgrading will occur automatically or in a uniform fashion across firms.  As yet, \nresearch has not yet examined in any depth the differences in rates and patterns of \ntechnological upgrading of TNC subsidiaries or the policy implication of any variety \nin upgrading patterns.  \n \nThe purpose of this paper is, therefore, to explore the pace and pattern of TNC \ntechnological upgrading in one major export sector, electronics, in Thailand.  As in \nthe case of other South East Asian economies, such as Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia \nand Vietnam, Thailand\u2019s export sector has been dominated by foreign TNC \nsubsidiaries producing electronics hardware including consumer goods, computing \nand telecommunications equipment, hard disc drives and semiconductor components.  \nIt is interesting from a developmental perspective to see whether and to what extent \ntechnological capability building has occurred across different types of TNCs.  It may \nalso be useful from a policy perspective to more deeply understand the trends, \nmotivations and limitations of capability building in TNC subsidiaries, so that \ngovernments are better placed to encourage the upgrading of the quality of \ncapabilities in both new and existing FDI.  \n \nBecause of the lack of previous research on the comparative upgrading paths of TNC \nsubsidiaries, an exploratory case study approach was adopted, based on in-depth \ninterviews with structured sample of 15 electronics exporting subsidiaries of various \nkinds within Thailand.1  Case material was gathered to explore and compare the \nstrategies and practices of different types of TNC towards upgrading.  We were \nespecially interested in the motivations, barriers and encouragements to technological \nupgrading and to understand the decision making process regarding capabilities from \nthe point of view of the subsidiaries themselves.  Using a simple \u2018benchmarking\u2019 \ntechnique, the research broadly categorised the subsidiaries according to levels of \ntechnological capability achieved.  Interviews with directors, managers and engineers \nwere used to explain the factors which underpinned upgrading paths and decisions.  \nThe cross-firm comparisons resulted in interesting differences between subsidiaries.  \nTo complement the cross-case analysis and provide more detailed insights into how \nextensive upgrading can occur, we also present one particular \u2018exemplar\u2019 case of \nsuccessful capability building illustrating the stages, processes and strategies involved \nand the motivations underpinned capability building. \n                                                 \n1  Thailand is an interesting case as the TNC subsidiaries are often viewed as lacking in technological \ncapability and \u2018behind\u2019 the levels of more advanced economies such as Singapore and Malaysia (see \nPart 1). \n 4 \n \nThe paper proceeds as follows.  Part 1 presents recent research on the technological \ndevelopment of TNC subsidiaries in Thailand and other South East Asian economies, \npointing to the limitations of capability building stages models.  Part 2 presents the \nsample design, method and field evidence examining (a) variety in level of capability \nbuilding and possible explanations for this (e.g. size of firm, product grouping, age of \nfirm and corporate strategy) (b) explanations for observed differences, according to \ndifferent categories of TNCs.  Part 3 presents the in-depth case example of an \nAmerican firm (Seagate Technology) which upgraded significantly in Thailand over \nthe past two decades, creating a burgeoning of local technological capability within \nthe disc drive industry.2  Part 4 assesses implications for industrial and innovation \npolicies for governments which are attempting to promote more rapid upgrading \namong TNCs.   \n \nAlthough the focus of the paper is on a single country and one cannot generalise from \none country to the next, we hope that the findings will have relevance both to other \nSouth East Asian economies which rely heavily on electronics producing TNCs for \nexport growth, and for other developing countries hoping to encourage local TNC \nsubsidiaries to increase their rates of technological upgrading. \n \n \nPart 1:  TNCs and Technology Upgrading  \n \nTable 1:  Technological Upgrading of TNC Subsidiaries in South East Asia \n \n Singapore Malaysia Thailand Indonesia Vietnam \n1960s Assembly     \n1970s Process \nEngineering \nAssembly Assembly   \n1980s Product \nDevelopment \nProcess \nEngineering \nAssembly Assembly Assembly \n1990s R&D Product \nDevelopment. \nProcess \nEngineering \nProcess \nEngineering \nAssembly \n \n \n \nSource: based on empirical research (see text for references) \n \n \nCompared with countries such as South Korea and Taiwan, the major South East \nAsian economies have depended to a large extent on TNC subsidiaries for export \ngrowth.  Table 1 presents a simple \u2018stages model\u2019 to summarise research into \ntechnological upgrading in the electronics sector.  TNC subsidiaries began exporting \nin Singapore, starting with simple assembly operations in the 1960s and progressing \nto more advance process engineering in the 1970s and then to minor product \nimprovements in the 1980s (Hobday, 1995).  Research shows an increase in research \n                                                 \n2  Although Seagate is not necessarily typical, it represents a useful historical case of successful \ndevelopmental. \n 5 \nand development (R&D) during the 1990s as wages rose and skills improved (Wong, \n1992; 1998).   \n \nThe TNC subsidiaries in Malaysia began their activities in the 1970s, again with \nassembly.  Technology transfer from parents enabled the expansion of export factory \nproduction and a progressive upgrading of both production processes and the type of \nproducts being exported.  While there was nothing especially new in TNC technology \ntransfer to Malaysia (or indeed Singapore), prior to this TNC investments had \noccurred mainly to serve domestic markets or to engage in tariff hopping, rather than \nexport production.   \n \nDespite observed technological learning at the plant level and the use of successively \nhigher levels of technology, Malaysia and the other South East Asian economies \nremained somewhat behind Singapore through the 1980s and 1990s, lacking in R&D \nand new product development capabilities (Ariffin and Bell, 1998; Bell et al, 1996; \nRasiah, 1994).  However, the TNC subsidiaries in Malaysia and Thailand acquired \nuseful manufacturing process skills and some limited product design capabilities and \nin some cases, limited R&D activities.3  A similar pattern began to appear in \nIndonesia and Vietnam but in these cases the TNCs had yet to achieve the levels of \ncapability development of earlier entrants.4  \n \nCase study research indicates that, typically, the main focus of the TNC subsidiaries \nhas been acquiring and upgrading technical and engineering skills aimed at \nassimilating and improving existing technology, rather than R&D activities for new \nproduct or process innovation.  Some studies (e.g. in Malaysia) show that the \nsubsidiaries struggled for many years to overcome obstacles and invested heavily in \nhuman resources to acquire technology from their parents.5  Firm-level research in \nSingapore, Malaysia and Thailand shows that some subsidiaries have learned to \ninnovate over time and now play significant roles within the overall TNC production \n(e.g. in semiconductors in Malaysia and hard disc drives in Thailand).  \n \nResearchers in the field point out that there is nothing \u2018automatic\u2019 in these stages of \ndevelopment and that they are, at best, merely rough historical representations of \ngeneral progress (Ernst et al. 1998; Hobday, 2003).  These types of models should not \nbe used to imply that all firms follow the general path or that, in the future, lagging \nfirms will necessarily follow the path of leading firms.  Instead, the proper use of such \ninterpretations is in the spirit of Gershenkron who used simple stages models to \nidentify deviations, diversity and differences in patterns of development and was \nhostile to using stages models deterministically or in a prescriptive manner \n(Gershenkron, 1962).  However, despite these caveats, as yet there has been very little \n                                                 \n3 For stages in general in Thai industry, see Intarakumnerd and Virasa (2002);  for firm-level \ndevelopment stages see Chairatana (1997); for electronics in Thailand see Poapongsakorn and \nTonguthai (1998). \n \n4  See Ca and Anh (1998) for Vietnam and Thee and Pangestu (1998) for Indonesia. \n \n5  See Ngoh (1994) for the case of Motorola and Lim (1991) for the case of Intel. \n \n 6 \nresearch on whether or not there are different propensities of TNC subsidiaries to \nupgrade technologically.6 \n \nFrom an historical perspective these findings on technological upgrading should not \nbe particularly surprising.  They are consistent with early research on international \nproduct life cycles (Vernon, 1966; 1975) and theories regarding the location of \nproduction (Dunning, 1975).  Vernon (1966) for example, argued that TNC \nsubsidiaries would initially locate production of mature, standardised products in low \ncost locations.  The findings are also consistent with advanced country research on \nhow TNCs distribute and integrate their global subsidiary activities (e.g. Bartlett and \nGhoshal, 1989; Ghoshal and Nohria, 1989).  These studies show that TNCs rely on \ntheir networks of subsidiaries to manufacture and, in some cases, to innovate.  Over \ntime, it is natural for some subsidiaries to mature and become world product design \ncentres and\/or centres of excellence for particular technological activities (Kogut, \n2002; Fratocchi and Holm, 1998) indicating that significant innovative activities have \ntransferred to the subsidiary.  Technological improvements by subsidiaries can be an \neffective way to promote the overall growth and competitiveness of the TNC network \n(Egelhoff et al 1998).7   \n \nSome research on subsidiary initiatives (Birkinshaw, 1997) criticises earlier studies \nwhich focused on the contrast between local and global markets in understanding \nsubsidiary upgrading (e.g. Bartlett and Ghoshal, 1989).  Birkinshaw (1997) argues \nthat subsidiary initiatives are, in fact, the manifestation of dispersed corporate \ninnovation and entrepreneurship.  The initiative process typically involves the \nidentification of an opportunity at the subsidiary level, subsequent negotiations with \nthe headquarters and, finally, the commitment of resources to a new initiative by the \nHQ.  \n \nHowever, it is clear that in some countries TNC technological upgrading does not \nnecessarily occur despite high profile and costly policies of encouragement, as in the \ncase of the Brazilian telecommunications sector.  In the developing world, Brazil is \nsecond only to China with respect to the volume of FDI attracted during the 1990s to \nDCs.  Quantitatively the policy of attracting FDI can be considered successful \n(Lacerda, 2003).  However, from an upgrading perspective there are major concerns.  \nFor example, to attract and upgrade FDI, tax incentives granted since 1993 to \nmanufacturers of telecommunications equipment exceeded US$3 billion over the \nperiod 1993 to 2003)8.  Case study research suggests that three of eight observed \nsubsidiaries (Siemens, Motorola and Ericsson) upgraded their role in the TNC \nnetwork allowing them to participate more strongly in global product development \n(Galina and Plonski, 2002; Galina, 2003; Perini, 2004a,b).  Nevertheless, despite the \n                                                 \n6 For a rare exception see Guyton (1994) who argued that Japanese consumer electronics firms were \nreluctant to transfer technology to Malaysia.  This particular study did not examine other TNC \nnationalities, or the impact of \u2018age\u2019 of investment in technology transfer performance. \n \n7 These findings were developed mainly within Canada (Birkinshaw, 1997) and then expanded to other \ndeveloped countries where subsidiaries have proved effective in promoting growth (Holm and \nPederson, 2000; Delany, 1998; Egelhoff et al., 1998).   \n \n8 The Information and Communications Technology Law (for details see Brasil 2004, Tax Law.  \nEmbassy of Brazil in London).  \n 7 \nlarge investments output indicators such as patent and publications suggest that \nBrazilian subsidiaries remain fairly insignificant within the overall innovation \nactivities of the respective TNCs and R&D remained very limited.  The sustainability \nof these policies is surrounded by great controversy within Brazil. \n \nWithin this context, research on electronics within Thailand shows the importance of \ninnovation for upgrading at the sectoral level (Brimble 2001) and the varied progress \nof locally-owned firms as they acquire technology (Intarakumnerd and Virasa 2002; \nChairatana, 1997).  Poapongsakorn and Tonguthai (1998) point to the need for \ntechnological capability building to sustainability the export success of Thailand in \nboth electronics and textiles.  Arnold et al (2000) provide general guidance on how to \nassess and enhancing policy support for industrial technology development within \nThailand.  Unfortunately, there is little published firm or sectoral level data on \nelectronics within Thailand, especially with respect to the exporting TNC subsidiaries.  \nTherefore, we adopted an multi firm exploratory study to enable in-depth case \nresearch and cross-firm comparisons to begin to build a picture of technological \nprogress in this sector.  \n \n \nPart 2: Analysing the TNC Subsidiaries in Thailand \n \n2.1 Method and approach \nElectronics exports from Thailand, as in other fast growing countries of South East \nAsia, are mostly based on two types of TNC subsidiary, called here \u2018primary\u2019 and \n\u2018first-tier\u2019.  Primary TNCs are those which first came to Thailand, usually to produce \nfinished goods or components.  As the initial plant investments they tend to start with \nsimple assembly operations and then incrementally learn production technology \naccording to decisions taken by the foreign corporate HQ.  First-tier TNCs are \nsuppliers of components and semi-finished products, which came later to Thailand, \nusually to supply the primary TNCs with necessary inputs as production expands.  \nSometimes first-tier firms then diversify to produce not only for their primary TNC \ncustomers but also for the wider international market.  \n \nTo analyse subsidiary upgrading, a combination of methods was required, including \ndocumentation analysis, questionnaires for gathering data on capability development, \nand a method for comparing upgrading across firms.  Following standard methods for \nmultiple case study research, we built up a sample of firms sufficient in number to \nexamine the paths and patterns of technological progress at the individual firm level, \nand to compare and contrast results across firms (Pauwells and Matthyssens, 2004; \nStraus and Corbin, 2004; Yin, 1994; Miles and Huberman, 1994; and Eisenhardt, \n1991).  As with all exploratory research, the intention was not to generalise our \nfindings to the entire population but to establish robust findings and arguments for \nfurther study.  By choosing a diverse range of cases, we were able to explore variety \nin patterns of change and to interrogate findings by comparing results across firm size, \nproduct range, ownership, corporate strategy and duration of operation.   \n \nIn order to assess the level and path of upgrading, a questionnaire was designed based \non the previous studies which examine the movement of firms through levels of \ncapabilities (e.g. Bessant et al, 2001; Arnold et al 2000).  We used a simple \u2018staircase \n 8 \nmodel\u2019 of capabilities running from weak (Level A), moderate (Level B), strong \n(Level C) to very strong (Level D).  We then adapted the staircase model to \ncorrespond to main technological stages described in Table 1 above, where Level A \ncorresponds to assembly activities, Level B to process engineering, Level C to \nproduct development, and Level D to R&D capabilities.  \n \nWithin the framework, firms which focus on assembly (Level A) have little need for \ntechnological effort or investment beyond maintaining production process quality.  \nThey will tend to have a small number of technicians and engineers focused on \nproduction quality.  Process engineering oriented firms (Level B) will generally \nemploy substantial numbers of technicians and engineers, and will be capable of \nsetting up, modifying and perhaps making minor improvements to production process \ntechnology. Firms which concentrate on product development (Level C) will have \nmastered process engineering and have the capabilities to design new products and \norganise production processes for these new products.  Level C is a wide band that \nincorporates firms with the ability to make incremental improvement to existing \nproducts and those with the capabilities for designing new products.  These firms will \nemploy a significant number of design engineers and may well have a formal product \nengineering department.  Firms with R&D capabilities (Level D) will have a full \ncomplement of process and product engineering, and substantial R&D capabilities \nand will typically have an R&D department.  While other firms may carry out some \nlimited R&D, to be included in this category a firm would have to be able to \ncontribute to the world technology frontier through R&D via the generation of new \nproducts or processes.  As noted, firms may pass through the various stages as they \ndevelop, but there is nothing automatic about progress.  \n \nThe purpose of the framework and questionnaire was not to achieve a precise measure \nof capability but to gain a rough benchmark to assess each TNC plant and compare \nthem against each other.  For each firm, case material was gathered on numbers of \nR&D, engineering and technician staff, types of equipment used, the main focus of \nproduction activities, relationships with HQ, tools and frameworks for analysing \ntechnology, links with local institutions and suppliers, the decision making process \nwith respect to technology, future strategies and areas of technical strength and \nweakness.  Historical information was also gathered on technological progress, \nmilestones and difficulties in order to roughly gauge the progress of each firm since \nstart up.  External sources of information on the company\u2019s history, number of \nemployees, turnover and products manufactured were also gathered (e.g. from the \nInternet), checked and updated during the interviews.   \n \n2.2  Sample design \nAs noted earlier, the electronics sector was chosen because it is the largest industrial \nexport sector in Thailand and has led the country\u2019s export growth over the past two \ndecades or so.  It is also likely to continue to be important to Thailand\u2019s future \ninternational trade.  Table 2 presents details of the firms audited.  To protect \nconfidentiality, code numbers were allocated instead of company names, according to \nsize, product type, age of firm and so on (see Table for an explanation of the coding \nsystem).  Fifteen firms were selected according to the two types of TNC (primary and \nfirst-tier) identified above.  The choice of 15 firms was largely determined by \nconvention regarding multiple case study research, and determined by the need (a) to \ngather sufficient data for understanding each case in depth and (b) to make cross firm \n 9 \ncomparisons.  The choice of 15 firms enabled us to structure a sample sufficiently \nlarge to make comparisons according to: (a) ownership of the firm, comparing most of \nthe various foreign-owned nationalities (e.g. American, Japanese, European, Korean \nand Taiwanese were included);  (b) the various types of product manufactured (see \nbelow); (d) different categories of company size; and (e) length of operation within \nThailand.  The sample enabled us to explore whether any observed differences in \ntechnological capability building related to these factors in any way. \n \nRegarding limitations, the sample does not necessarily correspond to the overall \nstructure of the Thai electronics industry in terms of population of electronics firms or \ntotal value of production.  This is partly because there is a lack of basic data on the \noverall industry (e.g. total employment, sales and exports by product type) and no \npublished studies of TNCs operating within the sector.  Nevertheless, both large and \nvery large firms were included and the sample did include a significant share of the \noverall industry with a total employment of more than 43,000 staff.  Also, the sample \nwas sufficiently large to capture several of the key causes of variety in terms of \ntechnology capability paths.   \n \nAs described in Table 2, the 15 TNC suppliers were made up of eight primary \nelectronic product and component exporters (code T1) and seven first-tier suppliers \n(T2) of finished components, component parts, and sub-assemblies to primary \ncompanies).  First tier supplier firms generally followed primary firms into Thailand \nand were generally more recent entrants.  We learned that most of these firms had \nexpanded their customer base to supply other TNCs outside of Thailand.  Like \nprimary firms, all first tier suppliers production was for export, either directly or \nindirectly via primary firms.   \n 10 \n \nTable 2:  TNC Subsidiary Sample: Electronics in Thailand \n \nFirm Category and \nCode Name9 \nStart Date Plant \nEmployment \n2002 \nOverall \nAudit Level \nExport \nmarket  \nShare10  \nOwner \nship11 \nMain Product \nLines \nBusiness\/ \nTechnology \nstrategy \nQualified \nengineers \n(total)12 \n%  of \nengin-\neers13  \n          \nType T1: Primary \nTNCs X8 \n         \nT1AUV 1982 13000 C 100% US HDD \nmanufacture \nand test \nUpgrade to \nhigher \ntechnology \nmanufacture \n500 3.8% \nT1BEV 1974 4100 B-C 100% Europe\nan \nSemiconductor \nassembly and \ntest \nUpgrade to \nhigher \ntechnology mfr. \n120 2.9% \nT1CTL 1990 2000 B-C 100% Taiwan\n-ese \nPC display and \nmonitor \nproduction \nUpgrade to \nhigher \ntechnology mfr \n106 5.3% \nT1DUL \n \n \n1984 1500 C 100% US Semiconductor \nassembly and \ntest \nUpgrade to \nhigher \ntechnology mfr \n150 10% \nT1EJL \n \n1990 1100 A-B 100% Japane\nse \nSemiconductor \nassembly and \ntest \nMature product \nassembly \n60 5.5% \nT1FTL \n \n1989 1029 A-B 100% Taiwan\n-ese \nResistor \nassembly and \ntest \nMature product \nassembly \n40 (e) 3.9%  \nT1GJL \n \n2000 1000 A-B 100% Japane\nse \nPrinter, fax, PC \nassembly \nMature product \nassembly \n30 (e) 3.0%  \nTIHJL \n \n2000 980 A-B 100% Japane\nse \nSemiconductor \nassembly and \ntest \nMature product \nassembly \n35 (e) 3.6% \n \nType T2 \u2013 First-tier \nTNC suppliers X7 \n         \nT2IJL \n \n \n1987 4,500 A-B 100% Japane\nse \nAudio \ncomponents \n(wide variety) \nMature \ncomponent \nassembly  for \nTNCs \n300 6.7% \nT2JJL \n \n \n1985 3500 A-B 100% Japane\nse \nTelecom \ncomponents \nMature \ncomponent \nassembly  for \nTNCs \n120 3.4% \nT2KKL \n \n \n1991 440 A-B 100% Korean Audio\/telecom \ncomponents \nMature \ncomponent \nassembly  for \nTNCs \n11 2.5% \n                                                 \n \nNotes\/explanations \n9  Explanation of coding (using first example, TIAUV): \nT1 = Type of TNC (T1, T2) \nA =  Alphabetical code of company interviewed (A-O, i.e. 1-15) \nU = Ownership: U=US, J=Japan, E-Europe, T=Taiwan, K=Korea, M=Malaysia; L=Local (Thai), \nQ=Japan-Taiwan joint venture \nV = Company size by employment (refers to plant audited, not to company overall): V = very large  \n   (>3000); L = Large (1000-2999); M= Medium Size (300-999); S=Small (10-299);  \n10  Includes both direct exports and indirect (i.e. components for TNCs destined for export); \n11  Q = Japanese-Taiwanese joint venture; \n12  Defined according to job task (e.g. design or production engineering); normally with batchelors or masters \n degree in engineering \n13  Calculated as percentage of total staff (not including technicians); estimates marked \u2018e\u2019 \n 11 \n \nTable 2 (cont\u2019d):  TNC Subsidiary Sample: Electronics in Thailand \n \nT2LQM \n \n \n1992 340 A 100% Japane\nse-\nTaiwan\n-ese \nJoint \nVentur\ne \nPC and TV \ncomponents \nMature \ncomponent \nassembly   \nfor TNCs \n10 2.9% \nT2MJM \n \n \n1995 320 A-B 100% Japane\nse \nComponents \nfor audio, \ncomputers \nMature \ncomponent \nassembly for \nTNCs \n10 3.1% \nT2NMM \n \n \n1999 300 C Local Malay-\nsian \nEquipment and \ncomponents for \nHDD assembly \nEquipment \nsupply for \nTNCs \n20  6.6% \nT2OUS \n \n \n2000 30 C Local US Equipment for \nPCB14 \nassembly \nEquipment \nsupply for \nTNCs \n8 (e) 2.7% \n \n \nTo assess the role, if any, of ownership nationality, the sample included most \nnationalities including six Japanese companies, three American, one European, two \nTaiwanese, one Korean, one Malaysian and one Japanese-Korean joint venture.  In \norder to see whether plant size influenced innovation progress, the sample covered a \nwide spectrum of sizes with four plants \u2018very large\u2019 (defined as having more than \n3000 employees) and five large (having between 1000 and 2999 employees).  A \nfurther five were medium sized (with between 301 and 1000 employees) and one was \nsmall (10-299 employees).   \n \nThe electronics exporting industry in Thailand consists of several product families.  In \norder to see whether product family related to capability building, a wide range of \nproducts and components were included in the sample, covering most of the \nelectronics product groups made in Thailand.  Some firms produced more than one \nproduct line and operated in more than one particular sub-sector.  The main product \nlines represented in the sample were: \n\u2022 Semiconductor (integrated circuit) assembly and testing: 4 cases \n\u2022 Other components (e.g. resistors and transformers): 2 cases \n\u2022 Hard disc drives (HDD) and HDD components: 2 cases \n\u2022 Audio equipment and components: 3 cases \n\u2022 Telecommunications products and components: 2 cases \n\u2022 PC and TV monitors and components: 2 cases \n\u2022 Complete PC and PC components: 2 cases \n\u2022 Machinery for assembly: 2 cases \n\u2022 General printed circuit board assembly (PCBA): 1 case \n \nThe sample included a spread of start-up dates in order to see whether the age of the \nplant influenced the degree of capability, the presumption being that more recent \nentrants may not yet have had time to establish their technological roots, whereas \nearlier entrants have had more time to build up capabilities.  Dates of incorporation in \nThailand included four cases if recent entrance (from 1999 to 2002), five cases of start \n                                                 \n14 PCB = Printed circuit board. \n \n 12 \nups between 1990 and 1995, four cases of start up between 1984 and 1989, and two \ncases of start ups prior to 1984.  \n \n2.3  Capability development comparisons \nThe study results revealed a wide spread of capabilities across different electronics \nsub-sectors, ownership nationalities and plant sizes in Thailand, although almost all \nhad progressed beyond level A (assembly) to process (level B) and product \nengineering (level C).   \n \nOf the sample of 15 firms, one fitted into the assembly category, eight were spread \naround the upper band of assembly and the lower band of process firms (on the \nboundary between level A and B).  Two plants were located between process and the \nproduct engineering categories (B and C) with most focussing on process but with \nsome design capability.  The remaining four firms were fully designated product \nengineering firms with one or two of these conducting some limited R&D.  Not \nsurprisingly, none of the subsidiaries were capable of contributing to the world \ntechnology frontier through R&D or new generation products (Level D), although \nseveral were engaged in new product development activities.  The one assembly only \nfirm was a Japanese-owned first tier supplier.  Of the eight on the boundary between \nassembly and process, six were Japanese-owned, one was Korean and one Taiwanese \n(four were primary firms and four were first tier suppliers).  Of the product \nengineering firms, our third category, three were American and one Malaysian-\nowned.  \n \nDuring the interviews, various possible explanations for different rates of \ntechnological upgrading were developed and explored.  For example, was this due to:  \n(a) the nature of the product type or family?  (b) the stage of development of the firm \n(as proxies by the date of incorporation)? (c) the size of the firm and plant in \nquestion?  or (d) the corporate and technology strategy of the HQ?  It is useful to \nreview the finding against each of these possible explanations in turn. \n \nFirst, regarding the nature of the product type or family, a lack of technological \nprogress did not appear to relate to the nature of the product in question.  In some \nareas (e.g. semiconductors) some firms had quickly moved beyond the \nassembly\/process categories, onto product engineering developments, having invested \nsubstantially in engineering capability (e.g. T1DUL and T1BEV), whereas others in \nthe same product family had made little progress (e.g. T1EJL).  In other product areas \ntoo (e.g. audio and telecommunications) there were examples of both \nassembly\/process and product engineering firms, indicating that product type was not \na determining feature of efforts towards local capability building. \n \nSecond, as far as stage of development is concerned, some firms had started more \nthan a decade ago (e.g. T1FTL, T1EJL and T21JL) but had remained at the first two \nlevels.  Others had entered at approximately the same time (or more recently) and had \nbuilt significant technological capabilities (e.g. T2NMH, T2OUS and L1QLL), \nindicating that start-up date (as a proxy for phase of development) was not a major \nfactor in capability building.   \n \nThird, turning to the size of the plant in question, again, this did not appear to be a key \nfactor in capability development.  On the contrary, two of the smaller firms were at \n 13 \nthe product engineering level, while some of the larger firms were categorised as \nfalling within the assembly or process categories.  Also, some small and medium \nsized firms were also of the assembly\/process type, suggesting that firm size was not a \nsignificant factor in technology development. \n \nFourth, the corporate technology strategy explanation appeared to carry more weight \nas an explanatory factor.  Analysis of the eight assembly\/process boundary level \nTNCs (plus the one fully fledge assembly level firm) shows that six were Japanese-\nowned, one was Korean, one Taiwanese, and one a Thai-Japanese joint venture.  By \ncontrast, most of the higher scoring TNCs were American- and European-owned.  As \ndiscussed below in more detail, the main explanation had to do with the technology \nstrategies adopted by the Asian TNCs (Japanese, Korean and Taiwanese firms).  \nTechnology decision-making within the subsidiaries appeared to be tightly controlled \nby the parent HQs and only that technology strictly required for assembly was \ntransferred or developed locally by the subsidiary.  This applies both to the  primary \nTNC producers and even more so to the first-tier suppliers.  Although designated as \nassembly-process level firms, the interviews revealed that these firms employed \nhighly competent and experienced managers and engineers.  However, they operated \nwithin a corporate environment where technology, capital (and other) investment \ndecisions took place mostly in the HQ location (e.g. in Japan or in Korea) and their \ntask was to implement these decisions efficiently.  Decisions not to develop \ntechnology in Thailand appeared to be part of a wider, coherent strategy towards \nglobal markets and technologies.  This is not in any way a negative assessment, but \nsimply reflects the decision to retain technological (and usually marketing and \nfinancial) control within the parent headquarters, sometimes jointly with leading (e.g. \nJapanese) customers and technology\/equipment suppliers within the HQ country.  It is \nalso conceivable that this could be partly the result of geographical proximity to the \nlocal subsidiary.  American and European subsidiaries were much further away from \ntheir respective HQs than the Asian ones perhaps encouraging more decentralisation.   \n \nFor the more passive subsidiaries, decisions were taken to focus efforts on assembly \nand manufacture rather than process development.  The data show that even this \n\u2018more limited\u2019 task requires substantial technical and engineering support to ensure \nefficiency and to make minor improvements to flows of production and so on.  For \nexample, the case of one Japanese firm (T21JL) although categorised as assembly-\nprocess (Levels A-B) employed around 300 engineers (6.7% of total staff).  Other \nfirms in this grouping also employed significant numbers of engineers in order to \nensure efficiency and flexibility in output.  The main role of this (substantial) \nengineering effort appeared to be organisation and improvement of the shop-floor \nactivities which underpin productivity of assembly operations. \n \nHowever, within the more tightly controlled decisions and technology structures of \nthe Asian TNCs there was little plant level demand for significant technology \nupgrading because of the wider corporate strategy.  These strategic differences \nappeared to be aligned with nationality, with Japanese and other Asian firms opting \nfor a more centralised technology strategy approach, and Western (US and European) \nfirms tending towards a more decentralised approach.  However, it is important to \nnote that these differences were a matter of degree.  The more decentralised American \nand European plants, for example, only went \u2018so far\u2019 in capability building and the \nlocal subsidiaries did not have complete autonomy, as one would expect.  In the \n 14 \nAmerican owned firms, for example, final decisions on capital and technology \ninvestments were taken at the parent headquarters (or in close consultation with the \nHQ) based on the relative advantages of different locations in other parts of Asia and \nelsewhere.  However, if subsidiary managers could make a case for local upgrading, \nand the parent HQs saw benefits in a relatively high degree of technology \ndecentralisation and the building up of local subsidiary capabilities, then investments \ncould take place.  By contrast, in the case of Japanese owned firms, for example, there \nwas little propensity for local technology upgrading beyond that required for current \nmanufacturing (which in itself can be quite demanding), and therefore, as argued \nbelow, little receptiveness to government policies for upgrading.  \n \nThe two American primary firms (producing semiconductors and hard disc drives) \nhad progressed quite far in terms of capability building, and both were product \nengineering (Level C) subsidiaries.  Generally, the first-tier TNC suppliers lagged \nbehind the primary TNCs, being mainly assembly \u2013 process companies, again mostly \nJapanese owned.  Of the two most dynamic process engineering companies, one was \nAmerican-owned and one Malaysian-owned.  Both of these produced equipment \nrather than components, and both had produced or were developing new equipment \nfor the Thai electronics industry in collaboration with their parent companies, \nsuggesting the small beginnings of a capital goods equipment industry in electronics \nin Thailand. \n \n2.4  Factors underlying capability upgrading in primary TNCs \nAs Table 2 shows, of the eight primary firms, three (two American and one European) \ncould be identified as being process \u2013 product (Levels B-C), indicating significant \ntechnological capability and strategies in place for further technological upgrading.  \nThese firms were dynamic companies operating under fairly decentralised corporate \nstrategies.  They had demonstrated their capabilities and were given encouragement \nby HQ to expand and move up the value chain of activities that, in turn, required them \nto absorb substantial engineering capabilities for operating and developing \nmanufacturing processes.  The three firms were strongly networked into other \nsubsidiaries and the parent HQ, so that they could assimilate knowledge, solve local \nproblems and move to new processes and products quickly.  The three benefited from \norganisational innovations such as continuous improvement, quality circles and \nstatistical process control methods as well as local engineering capacity.  However, \nthey had not yet moved onto significant new product development, nor R&D.  \nNevertheless, they looked forward to building new capabilities in the future and were \nopen to linkage forming within the local economy.  They were receptive to policy \nencouragement (e.g. participating in government vendor development schemes and \nforming linkages with local technical colleges and universities).   \n \nBy contrast, four (3 Japanese and 1 Taiwanese) of the eight primary companies were \nassembly \u2013 process (Level A-B).  Managers in these four companies were aware of \ntechnological trends and strategies, but operated within a more controlled corporate \nenvironment that strictly limited local innovation activities.  The parent strategies \nwere centralised in the sense that that there was very little need to upgrade subsidiary \ncapabilities beyond that required for current production needs, as decisions and \ndevelopments were conducted in the HQ.  In contrast to the US and European TNCs, \nthese firms were geographically much closer to their HQs and this fact might have \nplayed a role in the \u2018closeness\u2019 of the parent HQ relationship.  In these cases, almost \n 15 \nall significant engineering decision-making (e.g. choice of capital goods, installation \nof machinery, new product and process development) were taken by HQ, sometimes \nlinked into customers and suppliers in the home location.15  These firms had acquired \nthe engineering and technician capabilities required for assembly operations, often for \nlower cost mature product lines which were no longer produced in the home country.  \nThe case of one  assembly - process firm (TIEJL) is particularly interesting, as \nalthough it was in the same product semiconductor family as (TIBEV) and fell into \nthe process \u2013 product category, it had developed far fewer capabilities, indicating that \nproduct type, and length of stay, were not the main determinant of technological \nupgrading, but rather the strategy of the company concerned.  Like the more dynamic \nprimary companies, the passive subsidiaries were actively engaged in organisational \ninnovations including total quality management (TQM), continuous improvement and \nquality circles, important to production efficiency.  Several firms reported that they \nhad achieved impressive cost reductions arising from these efforts.  Managers said \nthat given their assembly task, their engineers were most appropriately focused on \nachieving operational efficiency in assembly, rather than acquiring additional or new \ntechnology. \n \nIn each primary firm, the main determinant in technological transfer and local \ncapability development was overall corporate strategy and, in particular, the way the \nThai subsidiaries fitted into the international division of technological and production \nactivities.  This is not entirely surprising, as it would be highly unlikely that a \nsubsidiary would act independently of, or in conflict with, the overall strategy of the \nparent.  In this sample of firms, strategy was closely associated with ownership and \ngeographical proximity, and this group of factors appeared to be more closely \nassociated with technology capability building say compared with product type or \ndate of start up. \n \nNeedless to say, in the assembly only plants, no R&D was undertaken or \ncontemplated.  These firms represented low cost, basic production capacity for the \nparents.  Although in some cases senior engineers and directors of these plants were \nhighly aware of global technological trends and strategies, having relocated from the \nparent plant, in areas such as capital goods modification, technology acquisition and \nimplementation, and exploiting external linkages with universities and technical \ncolleges, these firms were largely inactive and had very low capabilities in these \nareas, simply because these capabilities were not required within Thailand.  There was \nno need for local technological effort within the business strategy and this was \nreflected in the lack of technological autonomy and discretion at the subsidiary level. \n \nBy comparison, the American and European TNCs boasted much stronger capabilities \n(e.g. in HDDs and semiconductors).  The one European firm (T1BEV) had \nconsiderable technological strengths in capital goods selection and implementation, \nproduction engineering, product-process engineering, incremental product \nimprovement, and had a range of projects for new technology developments \nunderway at the local plant supported by locally trained engineers and managers.    \n \n \n                                                 \n15  For example in cases T1EJL and T1HJL new product decisions were made at HQ in consultation \nwith the suppliers of capital goods.  These decisions were then relayed to the subsidiary. \n 16 \n \n2.5  Capability building in first-tier TNC subsidiaries \nEvidence from the sample of seven first-tier subsidiaries confirms the above view that \nJapanese and Korean firms tend to operate under more centralised and \n\u2018technologically closed\u2019 corporate environments than American and European TNCs.  \nFour of these firms had reached the assembly \u2013 process level and a further one \ninvolved only in assembly.  The five had entered Thailand to supply primary firms, \nsometimes at the direct request of the primary TNC exporters, with necessary inputs \nwhich had previously been imported.  This applied to a wide range of product lines \nincluding audio, telecom, PC and TV monitors.  Some firms had diversified their local \nclient base and exported directly to customers in other external markets. \n \nThese five firms were mostly engaged in the production of simple, mature products \nusing low cost labour.  Production processes were basic and assembly-oriented.  \nRudimentary technician skills were evident but only those required for current \nassembly needs.  HQ staff took engineering tasks and decision-making with respect to \nproduction and, when necessary, engineers were dispatched from HQ to resolve \noperational difficulties.  Most production took place on fairly mature, well proven \nlines for standard products no longer produced in the home country of the parent.  In \nthese plants, at least up until the time of research, there was no need or demand for \nacquiring technological capabilities. \n \nWithin the group of seven first-tier suppliers there were, however, two examples of \ndynamic product engineering subsidiaries (T2OUS and T2NMM).  Both were \nequipment suppliers to the primary TNCs.  One was a medium-sized Malaysian \ncompany that had entered to supply high technology production machinery to the \nprimary TNCs.  The other was a small American subsidiary that also supplied high \ntechnology assembly equipment.  In both cases, customer demand required relatively \nstrong local technological capabilities and a conscious strategy for technology \nacquisition and upgrading was followed.  Neither plant were yet at the stage of \nproducing radical new products based on original research but both had significant \nengineering and development capabilities and both looked forward to further \ntechnology upgrading. \n \n \nPart 3: The Case of Seagate Technology Thailand (STT) \nAmong the most successfully upgrading TNCs in Thailand was the American firm \nSeagate Technology Thailand (STT).  As a case study, STT shows in more detail the \nstages a successfully upgrading TNC, running through levels A (assembly), to B \n(process engineering) to C (product development).  It also presents the typical \nmotivations, on the part of both the subsidiary and the parent, which underlie \nextensive technological capability building.  Furthermore, it indicates the length of \ntime it takes to upgrade, taking several decades to achieve its relatively advanced \nstage.   \n \nWithin Thailand, the subsidiary grew from around 50 employees in 1982 to more than \n35,000 in 1999.  In order to expand assembly and engineering and to achieve higher \nquality, STT invested considerably in training and process engineering in the area of \nhard disc drive (HDD) production.  The local subsidiary earned itself a corporate wide \n 17 \nreputation for innovative process design, high quality output and low defect \nproduction.  As a result of plant expansion, second-tier TNCs entered Thailand to \nsupport STTs operations.  Substantial technology transfer was made possible through \nlocal technological efforts, with foreign engineers and managers being replaced by \nThai staff, up to and including chief executive officer level.   \n \nLevel A: start up and assembly production  \nSTT began as a very small HDD assembly operation with around 50 employees in \n1982.  The company was the first foreign HDD producer to set up in Thailand.  By the \nlate 1990s, STT employed the largest concentration of Seagate employees world-wide \nand almost half of the company's total employees.  All of STTs production was for the \nexport market, mostly for other Seagate plants. \n \n \nTable 3  STTs five production plants  \n \n Location  Establishment   Total  \n    Date   Employment \n---------------------------------------------------------------------- \nPlant 1 - Chockchai -   1987    3,329 \nPlant 2 - Teparuk plant - 1988    13,267 \nPlant 3 - Rangsit -   1994   1,959 \nPlant 4 - Wellgrow-   1994    7,695 \nPlant 5 - Korat   1996     8,442 \n \nTotal        34,692  \n----------------------------------------------------------------------- \nSource:  Interviews, Company Reports \n \n \nIn the late 1990s, the three main production process steps carried out in Thailand were \n(a) head assembly (b) stack assembly and (c) drive assembly.  Seagate in Singapore \ncarried out the next stage in the process which is the final assembly of the HDD. \n(Malaysia and China also carried out drive assembly).  The main Chokchai plant \nfocused on two HDD product lines, low cost desk top PC HDDs, and high cost, high \nperformance workstation PCs.  The various components for the HDDs were imported \nor purchased locally, but not produced in the Chokchai plant which concentrated on \nassembly which is a highly complex, multi-stage process. \n \nLevel B: early technology transfer 1982-1988 \nWhen STT began in 1982, the main motivation for locating in Thailand was low \nlabour costs.  Although production scale was very small (i.e. assembly shop), high \nprofit margins soon induced Seagate to begin production in many different locations \naround the Bangkok area.  This expansion proceeded rapidly in various buildings on \nan ad hoc basis, driven by the need for capacity expansion.  Although small scale, \neven at this early stage (1982-1988) the quality required and the nature of the \nassembly process itself demanded fairly intensive technical support.  Around 15-20% \nof employees were engineers and technicians, including a high proportion of foreign \nengineers during this period.  Technology was initially transferred informally by the \nmore experienced foreign engineers to local engineers and technicians.  As local \n 18 \ntechnical staff became more experienced and more senior, they in turn recruited and \ntrained new Thai staff. \n \nSubstantial technical support was required not only for plant start up, but also to \nmonitor and control HDD yields, ensure consistency of materials and the high quality \nand reliability expected by the HDD buyers (mostly large PC makers, such as IBM, \nDell and Texas Instruments).  During this period, STT learned the \u2018art of HDD \nassembly\u2019 in Thailand, gaining experience in assembly, capital equipment, testing and \nquality technology. \n \nAdvanced Level B:  take off and major plant expansion: 1989 onwards \nIn 1989, the first major plant, Teparuk, was established, bringing together the small \nunits, and marking a new phase of technological capability building.  With increasing \nlevels of HDD integration and ever higher quality demands, production became more \nautomated and technology-intensive.  Engineering was initially centralised to promote \nsupport for the various stages of production.  By 1999 STT\u2019s Chokchai plant \nemployed around 1,500 technically qualified staff (10% of the total staff employed), \nof whom around 500 were engineers and 1,000 or so technicians of various kinds.  \nEngineers cover all the basic tasks of HDD assembly including, plant start up, capital \ngoods installation and modification, tooling, maintenance, process engineering \n(including statistic process control), quality engineering, software development and \nfailure analysis.  Within engineering, there were 15-20 PhDs, and large numbers of \nmasters degree holders.  The minimum qualification for engineer in STT was a \nbachelors degree.  Technicians normally held a qualification of some kind (e.g. a \ndiploma).  All staff received substantial in-house organised training and on-the-job \ntraining.  As a relatively high paying employee within Thailand, STT confronted no \nmajor shortages of technically qualified staff from local universities and colleges. \n \nIn 1999 the central engineering department was re-organised in favour of a distributed \n\u2018product life concept\u2019 in which all staff, including engineers, were allocated to \nspecific product groups.  This strategy, aimed to raise productivity through \nteamworking and to increase the subsidiary\u2019s speed and flexibility in response to \ncustomer needs.   \n \nLevel B involved intensive, if incremental \u2018behind the technology frontier\u2019, \ninnovation.  Competition, both among the corporate subsidiaries and with other HDD \nassemblers located in Thailand, forced the pace of innovation, both within STT and \nthe company's major competitors.  As is normally the case with catch up innovation, \nthis process did not require much R&D but instead called for incremental \nimprovements to manufacturing processes, machinery and equipment, and changes to \nthe way production was organised.  \n \nTo remain competitive in terms of quality and cost, one of the tasks of engineering at \nSTT was to remove non-value adding elements from the production process and to \norganise production in the most efficient and flexible way possible.  Routine \nengineering tasks included the improvement and re-configuration of testing \nequipment, tooling, fixtures, quality assurance methods and materials.  Raising \nproductivity also depended on more creative, non-routine engineering task and \nproblem-solving projects.  One such project began in 1996, which involved the \ncreation of a new cell (i.e. team)-based approach to production (of around 55-60 \n 19 \noperators to each cell).  In order to improve production yields, each production line \nwas converted into a semi-permanent team or cell, with the aim of instilling greater \nownership among staff of processes and problems.  At the start, defect parts per \nmillion (DPPM) was around 2%, (i.e. 98% yield) considered to be too high, leading to \nsubstantial rework and waste material.  With the new cell system each time there was \na problem (e.g. with yield levels or tooling) the production line was shut down and the \nteam had a meeting to identify causes and solutions.  Initially, under the new system \nyields fell to 93% (7% DPPM), as groups spent time identifying and resolving process \nproblems.  After two weeks or so, overall yield was back up to 95% and by the fourth \nweek yields has reached 99.5 to 99.6%. \n \nThis organisational innovation brought about significant benefits, for example, in the \nreduction of scrap material, the lowering of inventory and improved quality.  \nProductivity continued to rise as a result of the system, leading to current DPPM \nlevels of 0.05% (virtually defect free).  American management, surprised by the high \nyields at STT, visited to verify the results and learn about the techniques used.  As a \nresult, the cell system spread to the rest of Seagate plants, providing an example of \n\u2018reverse technology transfer\u2019 from subsidiary to parent. \n \nAs with many innovations, the cell system was not without its disadvantages.  Teams \nsometimes got \u2018set in their ways\u2019 and it became more difficult for management to \nallocate resources, given the need to maintain cells as units.  The system also called \nfor a great deal of training in the initial stages (around 15,000 employees required \nsome training).  Re-training was also required to increase cell flexibility (e.g. with \nnew product generations) to allow for better overall resource allocation.  A second \ninnovation was led by a PhD engineer who devised new analytical technique for \ngathering data for configuring HDD test procedures.  This method was accepted \ninternally and then presented to final customers, including IBM, for approval.  Again, \nthe system was widely adopted by Seagate, producing significant process \nimprovements in testing.  Incremental innovation also applied to some of the capital \ngoods used, most of which were imported from the US (e.g. most testing equipment \nwas imported).  In the case of tooling, prototypes were purchased from the US, then \nSTT engineers tested, maintained and re-programmed the software controls according \nto local needs. \n \nWhile there was no R&D department in 1999, there was a need for local engineering \ncapability to feed back to a new product design centre in Colorado.  US design \nengineers visited the plant regularly, providing a technology channel to the subsidiary \nand vice versa.  In addition, the two operations had a direct data link and, equally \nimportantly, kept in touch over the phone to relay back important data to help \nconfigure new products and processes developed in the US. \n \nThe process and nature of capability building  \nOne interesting dimension of the STT case is the shift from informal to formal \ncapability building.  In the early days training was informal, with engineers going \nback and forth to the US for training on particular aspects of HDD production.  By the \nlate 1990s, training and retraining was highly organised.  Each employee received \nroughly four weeks training per year.  The training department, which employed \nbetween 100 and 300 people at the Chokchai plant, depending on training needs, was \nresponsible for delivering training to the 15,000 employees.  During times of change \n 20 \n(e.g. the introduction of new product lines) new trainers were recruited in from the \noperating lines, expanding the training department up to the 300 level.  All operators \nreceived initial, formal training in the \u2018classroom\u2019 and then on-the-job, and all \nreceived a training certificate once they have passed a test.  All technicians and \nengineers also received regular training.  Training, as with most activities, was carried \nout in the Thai language, with the addition of a few technical English terms. \n \nA second dimension of capability building was the need to begin to develop a supply \nchain within Thailand.  Most of the key components (e.g. read\/write heads, wafers \nand sliders) were imported from the US and Singapore.  Only relatively simple \nproducts were purchased locally (e.g. wire).  However, several major foreign \nsuppliers followed Seagate into Thailand, forming a first tier of TNC suppliers to the \nlocal plant (e.g. Minibea and TPW) to supply components such as springs and stacks.  \nTPW, for example, entered from Singapore to supply stacks for the STT plant.  \nOverall, according to managers, there were too few local suppliers to support the \nneeds of STT and imports continued at a high level. \n \nA third facet of capability building in this case was the eventual forming of linkages \nwith external public sector organisations.  Up until 1996, STT was too focused on its \nown growth to develop linkages with university groups and government \norganisations.  However, in 1999 the firm began discussing issues with Asian Institute \nof Technology and several of the major universities.  STT had begun to donate \nequipment to support university R&D and offered a class on HDD technology.  STT \nsaw the benefits flowing in both directions, with the universities better able to support \nSTT with inputs of personnel as a result of closer collaboration. \n \nA fourth dimension of capability building was the devolution of some decision \nmaking to the local plant.  Given the very short product life cycles for HDDs (as low \nas 6 to 9 months in some cases), local speed and flexibility of STT were key factors \ndriving capability development.  STT needed to be able to take independent decisions \nin the manufacturing.  However, as a subsidiary the plant had no say in overall \ncorporate strategy, including new product development, future sales or marketing.  \nNevertheless during the latter stages, it had become closely involved in the \ncorporation\u2019s manufacturing strategy.  By the late 1990s, the local Chief Executive \nOfficer, an engineer by training, a Thai, had become a Senior Vice President of the \ncompany.  One of his tasks was to feed back new manufacturing developments to the \nboard.  Regarding new plant expansions, changes to process, volume targets and so \non, these were proposed by STT, discussed and agreed with HQ.  Implementation was \nthen a matter for STT.  By 1999 there were very few foreign ex-patriots involved and \nmost of the senior management and technical staff were Thai nationals. \n \nIn summary, the case of STT provides an interesting example of how extensive \ntechnological capability building can occur through the various stages outlined in Part \n1, within an economy not widely known for its technological achievements.  \nHowever, there were no rigid stages and the case of STT followed its own particular \npath which, as discussed earlier, differed from that of other TNC subsidiaries.  \nInterestingly, the technological capability upgrading which went on within STT also \noccurred in STT's main HDD competitors, most of whom operated in Thailand.  STT \nroutinely benchmarked its own performance against its rivals, usually when hiring-in \n 21 \nengineers from these companies, and found similar technical performance and \nproductivity levels.   \n \nPart 4:  Policy implications  \nWhile one cannot draw direct lessons for policy from firm level information alone, the \nevidence provides some interesting policy insights both for Thailand for other \ncountries wishing to encourage TNC subsidiaries to \u2018climb the technology ladder\u2019. It \nis highly likely that in most DCs with substantial FDI a wide variety of capabilities \nexist, as in the case of Thailand.  Therefore, it is probably wise to tailor government \npolicies and programmes to the different categories of subsidiary.  It is also highly \nunlikely that any single policy towards upgrading could address the range of different \ncapabilities and approaches taken by TNCs.   \n \nThe evidence suggests that policy should take into account at least two dimensions of \ncapability building (a) level of capability achieved and (b) the desire and need of \nfirms to upgrade local subsidiaries, which is closely linked to \u2018policy receptiveness\u2019.  \nPolicy receptiveness refers to the extent to which individual TNC are decentralised in \nterms of technology operations and willing and able at the local subsidiary level to \nengage with policies and institutions which support upgrading. \n \nTake for example, assembly firms (level A) which are policy receptive and willing \nand capable of upgrading.  Here government policies might focus on supporting the \nsupply of basic technician and engineering skills.  Government may consider \nsupporting collaborative projects involving colleges, universities and local technology \ninstitutes, which look forwards to future technological needs, perhaps centred on \nprocess engineering, product-process interfacing and product improvement, or vendor \nupgrading programmes to increase the local supply of inputs.  If subsidiaries are able \nto engage productively in such collaborative activities, then they may be able to \nbargain more effectively with their parent HQ for further investments in upgrading, \nsay compared with subsidiaries in competing countries which do not have such \nprogrammes.  Such collaborations may also build up understanding and trust between \nthe TNCs and other local actors. \n \nSimilarly, policy receptive process engineering-oriented Level B firms might already \nbe in a position to work with government agencies, universities and local institutes on \nadvanced automation technologies, product design projects and perhaps R&D projects \nin support of process and product design.  This could assist in the supply of human \nresources and encourage a more rapid upgrading than would otherwise be the case.  \nInvolvement in university MBA programmes might also be useful to support the \ndevelopment of the next level of managers required, and professors and students \nmight be encouraged to engage in projects involving the development of new strategic \nframeworks for technological acquisition and developments so that priorities can be \nestablished and addressed.  Progress in upgrading might require a systematic \nsearching for local technology solutions to particular business and technology \nproblems and local institutes might be able to assist here.  Firms, such as Seagate, \ncould be further encouraged explore experimental new approaches to new product \ndesign and process quality with staff and PhD students at universities.  In the longer-\nterm, this might assist the receptive subsidiaries to develop an internal capability for \n 22 \nR&D and lead on to new public sector support initiatives of the kind common in \nSingapore for example (Wong, 1998; Hobday, 1995). \n \nFirms capable of product improvement and new product development (Level C) \nmight benefit from projects involving advanced technical research and business \nstrategy development (e.g. focused on technology roadmaps for particular lines of \nproduct) and the challenging of firms to \u2018think outside of the box\u2019 as occurs in some \nMBA projects.  Government may try and encourage consultants or specialist research \norganisations to work with subsidiaries at Level C on advanced projects to develop \nthe next generation of capital goods or new products.  \n \nRegardless of how capable a firm is, the Thai study suggests that policies to \nencourage upgrading are best not directed at all firms in general, but towards specific \nfirms or groups of firms which are receptive to upgrading policies.  There is little to \nbe achieved by encouraging subsidiaries to build capabilities if this runs counter to the \nstrategy of the parent corporation.  By contrast, policies which focus on receptive \nfirms could potentially speed up the rate of upgrading.  It is highly likely that both \nvariety in capability and policy receptiveness exists in other countries, which implies \nthat that government agencies should focus on firms which are amenable to policies \nfor capability building.  It is equally unlikely that TNCs which are highly centralised \nin terms of technology strategy and investment decisions will respond to domestic \npolicies for upgrading as there is little need for local capability building.  By contrast, \nwhere TNCs follow decentralised strategies and where subsidiaries have a degree of \ndiscretion in technological upgrading, then policy makers have a fertile ground for \nsupporting and encouraging capability building.   \n \nIn Thailand the TNC subsidiaries which were not receptive to upgrading, not only \ntended to be centralised in terms of strategy but also operated within a relatively \n\u2018closed\u2019 technological environment within Thailand.  In these cases, technology \ndecisions were defined by the parent company and subsidiaries were far less open to \npolicy encouragement.  Technology requirements for local subsidiaries were decided \nup by the parent according to company\u2019s overall strategy.  In effect, this meant that \nthere was little desire to move towards subsidiary level engineering, new product \ndevelopment or R&D.  By contrast, TNC subsidiaries (e.g. the more advanced \nAmerican firms such as Seagate Technology Thailand) operated within a more open \ncorporate technological system which was amenable to local incentives and \nopportunities for upgrading.  These types of firm could benefit from policies which \nsupport local engineering developments within the domestic economy. \n \nThis does not mean that government agencies need to evaluate firms or to \u2018pick \nwinners\u2019.  Indeed, they may not have the skills or resources to do this.  In practise, \nreceptive firms are fairly easy to identify as they tend to respond to policy initiatives \nand requests for information as they are motivated to exploit external linkages in \norder to make the case for upgrading within the TNC.  In effect, they are \u2018self-\nselecting\u2019 in terms of policy.  Some of these firms have championed technological \nupgrading in Thailand (e.g. in HDDs and semiconductors) and these same firms might \nbe encouraged to further accelerate their pace of capability building.  Their incentive \nis strengthen their corporate case for further upgrading in the light of competition both \n(a) from other subsidiaries of the same firm in other countries and (b) subsidiaries \nfrom other TNCs in the same country.  Focusing on these firms might enable \n 23 \ngovernment to exploit \u2018stage accelerating\u2019 opportunities.  Put simply, receptive firms \nshould be the focus of policy rather than those which are not receptive to upgrading \nlocal plants. \n \nIf sufficient numbers of subsidiaries in the same sector are policy receptive, policies \nmay wish to go beyond encouraging individual firms to upgrade to consider how to \nupgrade networks of receptive firms engaged in similar activities.  For example, the \nThai Government is keen to encourage \u2018clusters\u2019 to develop to promote innovation \nand competitiveness.  Although the electronics sector is not normally targeted as a \npotential cluster, perhaps because of the dominance of foreign-owned TNCs, in some \nproduct areas (e.g. HDDs) there may well be the potential to encourage the \nformulation of a high technology cluster.  In HDDs, most of the major global \nsuppliers had located in Thailand, having followed Seagate into the country.  In \naddition, several first-tier TNC suppliers had entered to supply the primary TNCs, \nforming the early stages of a local supply chain infrastructure for primary TNC \nmanufacturers.   \n \nIn other countries where there is a potential for multiples cases of upgrading, \ngovernments may wish to encourage network upgrading through co-ordinating bodies \nsuch as industry associations or universities with relevant technical departments.  This \nkind of approach appears to have worked well in Singapore and Malaysia, helping to \ndevelop horizontal synergies between firms.  For example, in Malaysia the Penang \nSkill Development Centre was initially an industry supported training and human \nresource institute.  Today it plans for, promotes and supports the training and \ntechnical support needs of a large semiconductor exporting cluster in Penang.  The \nCentre is now supported by government in recognition of its important role.  In both \nSingapore and Malaysia, TNCs are encouraged to work together on common technical \nproblems and to support human resource developments for future needs.  In addition, \nforward looking firm-university programmes of technology development, including \nresearch into new products and investments in public sector technical training, are \ndeployed to encourage upgrading across groups of firms. \n \nGovernment agencies and industry associations may also wish to address barriers to \nupgrading in specific technical fields.  For example, if there are gaps in the supply of \nbasic components, machinery, services, materials and human resources which could \nand \u2018should\u2019 be available locally, but are not available, subsidiaries are forced to \nimport these inputs.  However, if there is sufficient local demand from a group of \nTNC subsidiaries it may be possible to encourage local investments to fill such gaps.  \nFor example, in Thailand\u2019s electronics sector there were shortages in the area of tool \nmaking services, castings development, nickel plating services, surface mounting \nsupport and cables.  Each of these areas could be a focus for government-sponsored \ntraining and human resource development perhaps based in technical colleges and \nuniversities.  Also, if there are difficulties in the basic infrastructure needed for high \ntechnology manufacturing, such as in electricity and water supply, it is wise for policy \nmakers locally and nationally to address these as they might be preventing receptive \nfirms to upgrade or imposing additional costs on upgrading. \n \nIn the case of electronics, firms of all capability levels in Thailand found it necessary \nto train their own engineers, as universities and technical colleges did not fully \nprepare graduates for the kinds of tasks they had to undertake within the subsidiaries.  \n 24 \nHowever, some of the leading universities (e.g. King Mongut) had a strong track \nrecord in setting up engineering and information technology courses relevant to \nThailand\u2019s future needs.  Professors from King Mongut University had assessed the \nneeds of the TNCs and agreed, with the TNCs, changes to their engineering courses in \norder to make their activities more relevant to students\u2019 future employers. \n \nFurthermore, publicly-funded training institutes might be a route to supporting TNC \nupgrading.  In the case of Thailand, the Thai-German Institute, a collaborate project \nwith the German Government, operates in a zone, north of Bangkok and was \ndeveloping its curricula with the participation of TNC subsidiaries.  This Institute, \nrecently established, focused on providing engineering training where shortages \nexisted (e.g. tool and die technology).  It incorporated modern facilities and hired \nlocal Thai professors to run engineering and management courses relevant to the \nelectronics producers in Thailand.  It was supported by the Thai Ministry of Industry \nwhich subsidised courses up to 70% of its cost.  Another, the Japan-Thai Institute, \nalso provided useful training to complement firm level training schemes.  Such \ninitiatives may prove useful and relevant to other nations seeking to upgrade from \nassembly level to technology-intensive production. \n \nIn the case of Thailand, one reason why Government is seeking to become more \nintensively involved in TNC upgrading is the growing competition from firms in other \ncountries (e.g. China) which not only benefit from lower labour costs but also from an \nabundance of technically skilled labour.  To meet low cost competition, more \nadvanced countries such as Thailand need to constantly improve their overall \ninfrastructure for FDI, or they may see a falling off in TNC investments in favour of \nChina and other lower cost countries.  In the case of HDDs in Thailand, the major \nTNCs had begun setting up plants in China.  In order to sustain their presence in \nThailand, the local subsidiaries had to consistently upgrade.  However, this upgrading \nprocess lacked an infrastructure of support which, for example, included public sector \nprogrammes of skills and technology development and collaborative technology \nprojects.  In the case of Thailand, Government could therefore support the HDD \nindustry to maintain its competitive advantage over China by encouraging capabilities \nwhich underpin not only operating efficiency but also new product development and \nresearch.  Such opportunities may also be relevant to other countries with a substantial \nTNC subsidiary base which is under threat of competition from China and other low \ncost locations. \n \nPolicies for capability upgrading not only need to differentiate between different \ncategories of firms and their level of receptiveness, they also need to adapt and \nrespond to constantly changing conditions in order to lead firms forward in capability \nbuilding to support competitiveness.  All this indicates that policy making in this area \nis a complex and dynamic process and that relevant, up-to-date information is needed \nby policy agencies on a continuous, and low cost, basis.  One very useful source of \ninformation and advice is the policy receptive firm itself.  Receptive firms could \npotentially be used provide information and advice on: (a) appropriate government \nstrategies for accelerating firm level technological upgrading; (b) how to expand \nforeign direct investment in new areas; (c) how to overcome supply chain problems; \n(d) develop cluster potentials; and (d) how to improve the supply of human resources \nfrom within public sector organisations such as universities and technical colleges.  \nFeedback from the firms interviewed, showed that managers often have a good \n 25 \nunderstanding of the problems and opportunities their plants face in the competitive \nenvironment in Thailand.  This may well apply to other countries. \n \nConclusion \nAlthough electronics is the leading export sector in Thailand and other South East \nAsian economies, its future progress cannot be taken for granted, especially with the \nentry of China into this sector (Lall and Albaladejo, 2003).  It is important that the \nTNC subsidiaries which dominate this industry continually upgrade their capabilities \nand move towards more technologically advanced production, or they may well lose \ntheir competitive edge.  Our study of 15 TNC subsidiaries in Thailand, however, \nshows that a wide distribution of capabilities exist among firms with some companies \nprogressing much further than other in building technological capabilities.  Some \nremained at assembly only (Level A), others had moved from assembly to develop \nprocess-engineering capabilities (Level B) while others such as STT had moved \nforward to incorporate product innovation skills (Level C).   \n \nAnalysis of the nine TNCs with relatively weak capabilities suggests that technology \ndecision-making was tightly controlled by parent HQ and only that technology strictly \nrequired for assembly was transferred by the parent or developed locally by the \nsubsidiary.  This applied not only to the primary TNC producers but also, and even \nmore so, to their first-tier suppliers.  In the case of these less dynamic TNCs, non-\nroutine engineering decision-making (e.g. the choice of capital goods, installation of \nmachinery, new product development and process innovation) were undertaken by the \nparent in the HQ location.  Decisions not to develop technology within Thailand were \nnot negative or obstructive, but were part of a coherent corporate strategy towards \nglobal markets and technologies.  Indeed, the evidence shows that substantial \ntechnical and engineering capability is required even in these, more \u2018passive\u2019 plants.   \n \nBy contrast, the six more advanced TNCs had developed significant engineering \ncapabilities and had strategies in place for further technological upgrading.  These \nfirms operated under relatively decentralised regimes, where offshore subsidiaries \nwere encouraged to move up the value chain of production activities.  Although these \nfirms had not yet moved onto significant new product development or R&D, they had \nstrong engineering and process innovation skills and looked forward to building more \nadvanced capabilities in the future.  They were also open to linkage forming within \nthe local economy and receptive to policy encouragement, unlike the less advanced \nsubsidiaries which operated in more \u2018closed\u2019 corporate technological structures.  For \nall firms, a major factor in local capability development was the TNC\u2019s overall \ncorporate strategy and in particular the way in which Thai subsidiaries fitted into the \ninternational division of corporate technological and production activities. \n \nThe research suggested various policy mechanisms to encourage upgrading according \nto the approximate capabilities of TNC subsidiaries.  These ranged from a greater \nsupply of basic technician and process engineering skills, through to projects to \nencourage new product development and R&D.  Specific human resource and \ninfrastructural barriers were identified (e.g. in areas such as tool and die making, \ncastings, plating services and surface mounting technology) where shared facilities, \nsupported by government have proved useful in other countries (e.g. Singapore and \nHong Kong).  Collaborative research projects for new generations of technology \n 26 \nmight also encourage TNC to look forward to future upgrading challenges and assist \nthem in their upgrading negotiations with their parent HQ. \n \nHowever, an important argument of the study, is that regardless of how capable a \nsubsidiary is technologically, government policies are best directed towards those \ncompanies which are most receptive to upgrading.  There is little to be gained by \nencouraging firms to build capabilities if this runs counter to the existing strategy of \nthe parent corporation.  Capability building and policy receptiveness seem to go hand \nin hand.  Fortunately, policy receptive firms are likely to make their position well \nknown to colleges, universities, training institutes and government agencies as it is in \ntheir best interest to support the building of a local \u2018upgrading infrastructure\u2019. \n \nOther countries may also confront variety in the capability levels of foreign \nsubsidiaries, propensities of firms to upgrade, and policy receptiveness of TNC \nsubsidiaries towards upgrading.  If this is the case, then policy makers in other \ncountries may also wish to consider differentiating policies according to levels of \ncapability and receptiveness in order to focus their efforts to maximum effect.  The \nevidence from Thailand suggests that it is wise to target policies towards groups of \nTNCs which are policy receptive and willing and capable of upgrading, rather than \n\u2018all firms\u2019 regardless of their technology strategies and ambitions.   \n 27 \nReferences  \n \nAriffin, N. and Bell, M.
