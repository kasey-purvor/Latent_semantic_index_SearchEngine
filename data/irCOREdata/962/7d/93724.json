In such a framework, we aim at studying the following problem:\ness sup\n\u03c4\u2208\u03a5t\nE\n(\ne\u2212\u00b5(\u03c4\u2212t) (S\u03c4 \u2212 1)+ \/ Ft\n)\n,\nwhere \u03a5t denotes the set of Ft\u2212stopping times taking values in (t,+\u221e[ and \u00b5 is a positive real number.\nThis issue comes from real options, and more precisely from the investor\u2019s problem to finance a project,\nwhen a (unique) sudden and drastic change can occur in the environment. No assumption is made on the\nimpact of this shock. As a consequence, even if our study includes credit risk issues, it cannot be reduced\nto this type of problems. In particular, we can also consider positive consequences of the drastic change\non the project.\n1\nReal options studies are usually written in a continuous framework for the underlying dynamics (see the\nseminal papers by Brennan and Schwartz. (1985), Mc Donald and Siegel (1986), Dixit and Pindyck (1993)).\nBut the existence of crises and shocks on investment markets generates discontinuities. Some papers have\nbeen studying the impact of such instabilities on the investment decision process (see for instance Gerber\nand Shiu (1998), Mordecki (2002) or Barrieu and Bellamy (2004)).\nThe question of the impact of a brutal change in the project environment has not been studied so far, to\nour knowledge. Such a fundamental change in the regulation can seriously impact, positively or negatively,\nthe project\u2019s future cash flows and therefore the investment decision. Many situations can lead to a major\nbrutal change in the project environment: for instance, a currency devaluation, an increase in interest\nrates, the finalization of brand-new technologies or the entry of a new competing firm. Mathematically\nspeaking, all these situations are similar and are equivalent to consider a single jump diffusion process.\nThis work aims at studying the impact of such a market perturbation on the decision taking. More\nprecisely, the investor has a budget allocation problem. He has to determine whether the project is\ninteresting and if so, to have some ideas of the optimal investment time as to allocate his capital among\nfinancial instruments with different maturities. Therefore, we need to specify the optimal benefit\/cost\nratio, the project investment value and the optimal time to enter the project for the investor when he\nconsiders the project. This problem is similar to the study of a perpetual American call option written\non the project ratio with strike 1. However, since this paper aims at analyzing a real option problem,\nwe do not adopt a risk neutral logic, and the calculations are made with respect to the prior probability\nmeasure, representative of the agent\u2019s beliefs. This does not induce any loss of generality and the results\nwe provide can easily be extended to the standard framework, where the perpetual option is evaluated\nunder an equivalent martingale measure.\nIn the second section of the paper, we introduce the framework of the study and present the model. The\nrelationship between a real option problem and the pricing of a perpetual American option is also recalled.\nThe main results on optimal stopping and perpetual options characteristics are given in Section 3. We\nobtain in this section closed form formulae without any assumption on the distribution of the jump size\nand with arbitrary positive or negative jump. Section 4 is devoted to the study of real option problems\nin a disrupted framework. We first illustrate the main results of this paper with different investment\nexamples.Then we analyze the importance of the calibration of the model and study the consequences of\na misspecification in a bearish environment. Finally, some proofs are delayed in the Appendix.\n2 The model\n2.1 Framework\nIn this paper, we consider a given economic agent having the opportunity to invest in a particular project.\nThe stochastic framework is described by a probability space (\u2126,F ,P) where P is the prior probability\nmeasure representing the beliefs and anticipations of the agent.\nThe project is characterized at any time t \u2265 0 by its profit\/cost ratio St. More precisely, this process\nsatisfies {\ndSt = St\u2212 (\u03b1dt+ \u03c3dWt +\u03a6dDt)\nS0 = s0\n(1)\nwhere:\n\u2022 (Wt; t \u2265 0) is a P\u2212Brownian motion,\n\u2022 The process (Dt; t \u2265 0) describes the potential shock of a drastic change in regulation on the project.\nIt is defined as\nDt = 1t\u2265T ,\n2\nwhere T is a random variable of exponential law, with parameter \u03bb. We denote by (Mt; t \u2265 0) the\ncompensated martingale associated with (Dt; t \u2265 0):\nMt = Dt \u2212 \u03bb\nt\u222b\n0\n(1\u2212Ds)ds . (2)\n\u2022 The jump size \u03a6 is a random variable. More precisely, \u03a6 measures the impact of the perturbation\non the profit\/cost ratio.\nTherefore, the solution of the SDE (1) is:\nSt = s0 (1 + \u03a6)\nDt exp\n[(\n\u03b1\u2212 1\n2\n\u03c32\n)\nt+ \u03c3Wt\n]\nWe assume the Brownian motion and the random variable T to be independent. Moreover, the random\nvariable \u03a6 is taken independent of both the Brownian motion and the jump time process. Note that such\nan assumption is reasonable since the (regulation) shock is exogenous to the project we consider.\nAssumptions: From now on, we make the following technical assumptions, ensuring that the problem\nwe consider is well-defined and is non-degenerate:\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\ni) \u22121 < \u03a6 \u2264 \u03a6 < \u03a6 ;\nii) 0 < s0 < 1 ;\niii) \u03c3 > 0 ;\niv) \u00b5 > max(0, \u03b1, \u03b1+ \u03bb\u03a6).\n(H)\nThe first assumption \u03a6 > \u22121 implies that the ratio S remains strictly positive, therefore the investment\nopportunity is never worthless. Considering a bounded \u03a6 ensures that the positive impact of a drastic\nchange in the environment cannot be infinite. Therefore, the situation we study is neither catastrophic\nnor explosive ; \u03a6 is also assumed to be not identically equal to 0, otherwise this study is reduced to the\nstandard \u201dBlack-Scholes\u201d framework.\nThe second assumption states that the project is interesting (s0 > 0) but also that the problem is about\na \u201dtrue\u201d decision since s0 is (strictly) less than 1: delaying the project realization is only relevant in the\ncase where the profits\/costs ratio is less than one.\nThe third condition maintains a Brownian source of randomness in the process dynamics. It is indeed\nreasonable to assume that the ratio profits\/costs randomly evolves even without a major modification of\nthe project environment.\nFinally, the fourth assertion of (H) is an integrability condition.\nThe available information structure is characterized by the filtration (Ft; t \u2265 0). At each instant of time\nt, the agent knows what is the current value of the ratio profit\/cost related to the project, and therefore\nknows \u03c3 (Ss; 0 \u2264 s \u2264 t). This information includes the value of Dt: indeed, at each instant t, from the\nobservation of the underlying process S, the agent knows whether the shock has already occurred or not.\nAs a consequence, the filtration Ft is defined as:\nFt = \u03c3 (Ss,Ds; 0 \u2264 s \u2264 t) .\nNote that the approach defined by the framework we consider differs from those of the models of the\nliterature related to both real options and American options. In particular, real options studies are usually\nwritten in a continuous framework for the underlying dynamics (see the seminal papers by Brennan and\nSchwartz. (1985), Mc Donald and Siegel (1986), Dixit and Pindyck (1993)). But the existence of crises\nand shocks on investment markets generates discontinuities. Some papers have been studying the impact\nof such instabilities on the investment decision process (see for instance Gerber and Shiu (1998), Mordecki\n3\n(2002) or Barrieu and Bellamy (2004)). The question of the impact of a brutal change in the project\nenvironment however has not been studied so far, to our knowledge. Moreover, on the contrary to most\nof the existing literature on American options (see for instance Gerber and Shiu (1998), Mordecki (2002)\nor Chesney and Jeanblanc (2004), the underlying process S cannot be written in terms of a L\u00e9vy process\nXt as S0 exp (Xt). Quite recently, Muroi (2002) has considered a general framework involving a possible\ndefault for the underlying process of an American option. His approach is however different in the sense\nthat it is focused on the numerical aspects and based upon partial differential equation methods. Moreover\nhe does not provide closed-form characterizations of the American option.\n2.2 Perpetual option and investment problem\nThe investor has neither any obligation to undertake it nor any time constraint to take his decision.\nTherefore, the investment decision problem is often brought down to the study of a perpetual American\noption with the profit\/cost ratio S as underlying and 1 as striking level (see for instance Mac Donald and\nSiegel (1986)). Solving the real option problem at any time t is equivalent to determine the value of the\nfollowing quantity:\nCt = ess sup\n\u03c4\u2208\u03a5t\nE\n(\ne\u2212\u00b5(\u03c4\u2212t) (S\u03c4 \u2212 1)+ \/ Ft\n)\n(3)\nwhere \u03a5t denotes the set of Ft\u2212stopping times taking values in (t,+\u221e[ and where \u00b5 is the discount rate,\nwhich can be different from the instantaneous risk-free rate and represents the agent\u2019s preferences for the\npresent, E is the expectation with respect to the prior probability measure P.\nThe pair (D,S) being Markovian, we can rewrite Ct as follows\nCt = ess sup\n\u03c4\u2208\u03a5t\nE\n(\ne\u2212\u00b5(\u03c4\u2212t) (S\u03c4 \u2212 1)+ \/ Ft\n)\n= ess sup\n\u03c4\u2208\u03a5t\nE\n(\ne\u2212\u00b5(\u03c4\u2212t) (S\u03c4 \u2212 1)+ \/ St,Dt\n)\nor for all (t, x, d) \u2208 R+ \u00d7R+ \u00d7 {0, 1}, adopting the natural notation C(t, x, d):\nC(t, x, d) = ess sup\n\u03c4\u2208\u03a5t\nE\n(\ne\u2212\u00b5(\u03c4\u2212t) (S\u03c4 \u2212 1)+ \/ St = x,Dt = d\n)\n(4)\nNote that the computations are made with respect to the prior probability measure P, corresponding to\nthe agent\u2019s beliefs. This does not create any loss of generality. If the underlying asset of the investment\noption is traded on financial market, a risk-neutral valuation formula can be easily obtained by considering\na risk-neutral probability measure, as underlined in the following remark:\nRemark 1 If a risk-neutral approach is adopted, then the only changes in the results come from both the\nmodification of the discount rate \u00b5 in the instantaneous risk-free rate r, and a modification in the jump\nprocess intensity. More precisely, any equivalent martingale measure P(\u03c8,\u03b3) is defined in terms of a pair\nof processes (\u03c8, \u03b3), satisfying the usual regularity conditions and being solution of{\n\u03b1+ \u03bb\u03a6(1\u2212Dt)\u2212 r + \u03c3\u03c8t + \u03bb\u03a6\u03b3t = 0\n\u03b3t > \u22121\nThe Radon-Nikodym derivative\ndP(\u03c8,\u03b3)\ndP\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223Ft = L(\u03c8,\u03b3)t is given by: dL(\u03c8,\u03b3)t = L(\u03c8,\u03b3)t (\u03c8tdWt + \u03b3tdMt) ;\nL\n(\u03c8,\u03b3)\n0 = 1. Therefore the intensity of (Dt; t \u2265 0) evaluated with respect to P(\u03c8,\u03b3) is equal to \u03bb\n\u222b t\n0\n(1 + \u03b3s) (1\u2212Ds) ds.\n4\n3 Main results on optimal stopping and perpetual options\nThis third section is devoted to the study of the perpetual call option, described in Subsection 2.2. We\nfirst prove the existence of an optimal stopping time in Equation (4)\nC(t, x, d) = ess sup\n\u03c4\u2208\u03a5t\nE\n(\ne\u2212\u00b5(\u03c4\u2212t) (S\u03c4 \u2212 1)+ \/ St = x,Dt = d\n)\nand characterize it as the hitting time of an optimal frontier. Then, we look at the different characteristics\nof the perpetual option. More precisely, we provide closed-form formulae for the Laplace transform of the\noptimal stopping time and for the real option value.\n3.1 Case Dt = 1\nTwo very different situations have to be studied separately, depending on whether the jump has already\noccurred or not (in other words, whether d = 1 or d = 0) at time t of the study. The arguments used in\nboth cases are of a completely different nature.\nWe can first notice that in the situation where the jump has occurred before time t, the problem\nC(t, x, 1) = ess sup\n\u03c4\u2208\u03a5t\nE\n(\ne\u2212\u00b5(\u03c4\u2212t) (S\u03c4 \u2212 1)+ \/ St = x,Dt = 1\n)\n(5)\nis similar to the standard one. As a consequence, the results are well known and therefore we simply state\nthe results and sketch their proof. More precisely,\nProposition 1 i) The optimal hitting time in Problem (5) exists and it is characterized as the first hitting\ntime of a constant level L1,\u2217:\nC(t, x, 1) = sup\nL\u22651\nE\n(\ne\u2212\u00b5(\u03c4L\u2212t) (S\u03c4L \u2212 1)+ \/ St = x, Dt = 1\n)\n= E\n(\ne\u2212\u00b5(\u03c4L1,\u2217\u2212t)\n(\nS\u03c4L1,\u2217 \u2212 1\n)+\n\/ St = x, Dt = 1\n)\nwhere \u03c4L the first hitting time of L\n\u03c4L = inf {t \u2265 0 ;St \u2265 L} .\nii) The optimal level L1,\u2217 is given by:\nL1,\u2217 =\nk1\nk1 \u2212 1\nwhere k1 is the unique positive real such that \u03c8 (k1) = \u00b5, with \u03c8, the L\u00e9vy exponent of the L\u00e9vy process\ndefined by Xs =\n(\n\u03b1\u2212 12\u03c32\n)\ns+ \u03c3Ws.\ni) The Laplace transform of the optimal time is:\nE\n(\ne\u2212\u00b5(\u03c4L1,\u2217\u2212t) \/ St = x,Dt = 1\n)\n=\n( x\nL1,\u2217\n) L1,\u2217\nL1,\u2217\u22121\n,\nii) The price of the real option is given by:\nC(t, x, 1) =\n(\nL1,\u2217 \u2212 1)(L1,\u2217\nx\n)\u2212k1\nwhere the optimal level L1,\u2217 is given by Proposition 1.\n5\nProof.\nNote that, on the set {t \u2265 T}, we necessarily have \u03c4L \u2265 T and as a consequence for any s, t such that\n0 \u2264 T \u2264 t \u2264 s:\nSs = x exp\n((\n\u03b1\u2212 1\n2\n\u03c32\n)\n(s\u2212 t) + \u03c3 (Ws \u2212Wt)\n)\n;St = x\nTherefore, the proof of these results is similar to that of the standard Black-Scholes model (see for instance\nMerton (1992) section 8.8, or Karatzas et al.(1998) section 2.6) and we omit it.\nNote that the formulae do not apparently depend on the jump size \u03a6. This comes from the fact that\nafter the jump, the jump size does not play any role apart from the shift in the \u201dinitial condition\u201d, which\nbecomes s0 (1 + \u03a6) instead of s0. This dependency is somehow hidden in the value x of the process at\ntime t.\nOn the following , we only consider the case where Dt = 0, since this second situation where the jump has\nnot already occurred at time t is not standard.\n3.2 Existence and characterization of an optimal stopping time\nIn this section, we consider the question of the existence of an optimal stopping time for the problem (4).\nThe following result holds true:\nTheorem 2 There exists an optimal stopping time for the problem (4). In other words, there exists\n\u03c4\u2217t \u2208 \u03a5t such that\nC(t, x, d) = E\n(\ne\u2212\u00b5(\u03c4\n\u2217\nt\u2212t)\n(\nS\u03c4\u2217t \u2212 1\n)+\n\/ St = x,Dt = d\n)\nMoreover, \u03c4\u2217t is characterized as the first hitting time by the process S of a frontier L\nd,\u2217\nt , fully known at\ntime t. More precisely,\n\u03c4\u2217t = inf\n{\ns \u2265 t;Ss \u2265 Ld,\u2217t\n}\nThe problem is of a double nature: first we have to prove the existence of an optimal stopping time for:\nC(t, x, 0) = ess sup\n\u03c4\u2208\u03a5t\nE\n(\ne\u2212\u00b5(\u03c4\u2212t) (S\u03c4 \u2212 1)+ \/ St = x,Dt = 0\n)\n(6)\nand then we have to characterize it.\nExistence of an optimal stopping time For any x \u2208 R+\u2217 , and for Dt = 0, we denote by St,x,0. the\ntrajectory of the process S such that St,x,0t = x. Hence, for any s \u2265 t :\nSt,x,0s = x (1 + \u03a6)\nDs exp\n[(\n\u03b1\u2212 1\n2\n\u03c32\n)\n(s\u2212 t) + \u03c3 (Ws \u2212Wt)\n]\n(7)\nThe following result holds true:\nLemma 3 The stopping time \u03c4\u2217t defined as\n\u03c4\u2217t = inf\n{\ns \u2265 t \/ C (s, St,x,0s , 0) = (St,x,0s \u2212 1)+}\nis P - almost surely finite.\n6\nProof. The constants \u03a6 and \u03a6 being defined in Assumptions (H), S\u03a6 and C\u03a6 are the process and the\nfunction defined as follows:\nfor s \u2265 t, S\u03a6s = x (1 + \u03a6) exp\n[(\n\u03b1\u2212 1\n2\n\u03c32\n)\n(s\u2212 t) + \u03c3 (Ws \u2212Wt)\n]\n,\nand\nC\u03a6(t, x) = ess sup\n\u03c4\u2208\u03a5t\nE\n(\ne\u2212\u00b5(\u03c4t\u2212t)\n(\nS\u03a6\u03c4t \u2212 1\n)+\n\/ S\u03a6t = x (1 + \u03a6)\n)\n.\nThe process S\u03a6 and the function C\u03a6 are defined in a similar way.\nBecause the inequalities \u22121 < \u03a6 \u2264 \u03a6 < \u03a6 hold true, we can write:\n\u03c4\u2217t \u2264 inf\n{\ns \u2265 t \/ C\u03a6(t, x) = (St,x,0s \u2212 1)+}\n\u2264 inf\n{\ns \u2265 t \/ C\u03a6(t, x) =\n(\nS\n\u03a6\ns \u2212 1\n)+}\n\u2264 inf\n{\ns \u2265 t \/ C\u03a6(t, x) = k\n(\nS\u03a6s \u2212 1k\n)+}\nwhere k =\n1 +\u03a6\n1 +\u03a6\n. Now, fom Hypothesis ((H) assertion iv), we have\ninf\n{\ns \u2265 t \/ C\u03a6(t, x) = k\n(\nS\u03a6s \u2212\n1\nk\n)+}\n<\u221e, P. a.s.\n\u0001\nProposition 4 There exists an optimal stopping time for Problem (6). In other words, there exists \u03c4\u2217t \u2208 \u03a5t\nsuch that\nC(t, x, 0) = E\n(\ne\u2212\u00b5(\u03c4\n\u2217\nt\u2212t)\n(\nS\u03c4\u2217t \u2212 1\n)+\n\/ St = x,Dt = 0\n)\n(8)\nProof. From equation (7), Assumption ((H) , i) and iv)), we deduce that the optimal stopping theory\ncan apply (see for instance Shiryayev (1978) (Theorem 3.3) or El Karoui (1979)); therefore we conclude\nfrom Lemma 3 that the stopping time \u03c4\u2217t is optimal. \u0001\nCharacterization of the optimal stopping time In this second part of the proof, we want to char-\nacterize the optimal stopping time of Problem (6). More precisely, using the same type of arguments as\nin Jacka (1991), we get a characterization similar to the one obtained in the case where Dt = 1.\nLet Y be the continuation region defined by:\nY = {(t, x) \/ C(t, x, 0) > (x\u2212 1)+}\nand Yt denotes the section:\nYt = {x \/ (t, x) \u2208 Y}\nWe first gives the characterization of the section Yt of the continuation region in terms of an optimal\nfrontier. More precisely,\nProposition 5 For any t > 0, there exists L0,\u2217t > 1 such that\nYt =\n[\n0, L0,\u2217t\n[\n7\nProof.\nFrom Equation (8), the function x \f\u2192 C (t, x, 0) is continuous therefore it suffices to prove the following\nimplication:\n(x \u2208 Yt and 0 < y < x) =\u21d2 (y \u2208 Yt)\nLet us assume that x \u2208 Yt. As a consequence, C(t, x, 0) > (x\u2212 1)+. Let \u03c4xt be defined by\n\u03c4xt = inf\n{\ns \u2265 t \/ (s, St,x,0s ) \/\u2208 Y}\nWe have, on the one hand\nC(t, x, 0) = E\n(\ne\u2212\u00b5(\u03c4\nx\nt\u2212t)\n(\nS\u03c4xt \u2212 1\n)+\n\/ St = x, Dt = 0\n)\n= E\n(\ne\u2212\u00b5(\u03c4\nx\nt\u2212t)\n(\nSt,x,0\u03c4xt \u2212 1\n)+)\nand on the other hand, as \u03c4xt is not optimal for C (t, y, 0)\nC(t, y, 0) \u2265 E\n(\ne\u2212\u00b5(\u03c4\nx\nt\u2212t)\n(\nSt,x,0\u03c4xt \u2212 1\n)+ )\nTherefore\nC(t, x, 0)\u2212C(t, y, 0) \u2264 E\n(\ne\u2212\u00b5(\u03c4\nx\nt\u2212t)\n[(\nSt,x,0\u03c4xt \u2212 1\n)+\n\u2212\n(\nSt,y,0\u03c4xt \u2212 1\n)+])\nThe assumption 0 < y < x together with Equation (7) imply\nC(t, x, 0)\u2212C(t, y, 0) \u2264 E\n(\ne\u2212\u00b5(\u03c4\nx\nt\u2212t)\n(\nSt,x,0\u03c4xt \u2212 S\nt,y,0\n\u03c4xt\n))\n\u2264 (x\u2212 y)E\n(\ne(\u03b1\u2212\u00b5)(\u03c4\nx\nt\u2212t)+\u03bb\n\u222b \u03c4xt\nt ln(1+\u03a6)(1\u2212Ds)dsE (\u03c3W )\u03c4yt ,t\n)\nwhere E (\u03c3W )\u03c4yt ,t = exp\n(\n\u03c3\n(\nW\u03c4yt \u2212Wt\n)\u2212 12\u03c32 (\u03c4yt \u2212 t))\nLet P\u02dc be the probability measure, equivalent to P, defined by:\ndP\u02dc\ndP\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223Ft = exp\n(\n\u03c3Wt \u2212 1\n2\n\u03c32t\n)\nThen\nC(t, x, 0)\u2212C(t, y, 0) \u2264 (x\u2212 y) E\u02dc\n(\ne(\u03b1\u2212\u00b5)(\u03c4\nx\nt\u2212t)+\u03bb\n\u222b \u03c4xt\nt ln(1+\u03a6)(1\u2212Ds)ds\n)\nFrom the assumption (H), iv), E\u02dc\n(\ne(\u03b1\u2212\u00b5)(\u03c4\nx\nt\u2212t)+\u03bb\n\u222b \u03c4xt\nt ln(1+\u03a6)(1\u2212Ds)ds\n)\n\u2264 1 and\nC(t, x, 0)\u2212C(t, y, 0) \u2264 (x\u2212 y)\nor\nC(t, y, 0) \u2265 C(t, x, 0)\u2212 (x\u2212 y) > (x\u2212 1)+ \u2212 (x\u2212 y) > y \u2212 1\nLet \u03be = inf\n{\nu \u2265 t \/ St,y,0u \u2265 2\n}\n, then\nC(t, y, 0) \u2265 E\n(\ne\u2212\u00b5(\u03be\u2212t)\n(\nSt,y,0\u03be \u2212 1\n)+ )\n\u2265 E (e\u2212\u00b5(\u03be\u2212t) ) > 0\nTherefore, for any (t, y) \u2208 R+ \u00d7R+\u2217 , C(t, y, 0) > 0. Finally, C(t, y, 0) > (y \u2212 1)+. Hence the result. \u0001\nWe can now characterize the optimal stopping time as the hitting time of a frontier:\n8\nCorollary 6 The optimal stopping time \u03c4\u2217t of Problem (6) is characterized by:\n\u03c4\u2217t = inf\n{\ns \u2265 t \/ St,x,0s \u2265 L0,\u2217t\n}\nwhere L0,\u2217t is defined in Proposition 5.\nProof. The proof is an immediate consequence of Proposition 5. \u0001\n3.3 Perpetual option characteristics\nWe are now interested in finding the perpetual option characteristics, in particular its value. As previously,\nwe only consider the situation where the jump has not occurred yet at time t. We now want to study the\ncharacteristics of the following perpetual option:\nC(t, x, 0) = ess sup\n\u03c4\u2208\u03a5t\nE\n(\ne\u2212\u00b5(\u03c4\u2212t) (S\u03c4 \u2212 1)+ \/ St = x,Dt = 0\n)\nwhich can also be written, using Corollary 6 as\nC(t, x, 0) = ess sup\nL0t\u22651\nE\n(\ne\n\u2212\u00b5\n(\n\u03c4\nL\n0,\nt\n\u2212t\n) (\nS\u03c4\nL0t\n\u2212 1\n)+\n\/ St = x,Dt = 0\n)\nFor the sake of simplicity in the notation and computation but without loss of generality, we consider this\nproblem at time t = 0 (obviously, D0 = 0). Therefore, we look at:\nC(0, s0, 0) = ess sup\nL0\u22651\nE\n(\ne\u2212\u00b5\u03c4L0\n(\nS\u03c4L0 \u2212 1\n)+\n\/ S0 = s0\n)\n(9)\nWe now present the main result of this paper, giving the perpetual option characteristics in a general\nframework where we do not know a priori the sign of the jump size \u03a6. The following two theorems provide\nthese explicit formulae at time 0. In particular, the optimal frontier and a characterization of the optimal\nhitting time are now given in Theorem 7:\nTheorem 7 i) The optimal frontier of the problem (9) is given by\nL0,\u2217\u03a6 =\n\u03b7 (\u03a6)\n\u03b7 (\u03a6)\u2212 1 + \u0393 (\u03a6) ,\nwhere\n\u03b7 (\u03a6) = 2\n\u03c3\nf0(\u03bb, a0) + \u03b80\u03c3\n\u2212 2\n\u03c3\nE\n(\n1\u03a6<0 (1 + \u03a6)\n\u03b80\n\u03c3\n)\nf0(\u03bb, a0)\n+ 2\n\u03c3\nE\n[\n1\u03a6>0\n[\n\u03bb\n(\u03bb+\u00b5)\u2206f0,\u03a6(\u03bb+ \u00b5, a0 \u2212 \u03b80)\u2212 (1 + \u03a6)\n\u03b80\n\u03c3 f\u03a6(\u03bb, a0)\n]]\nand \u0393 (\u03a6) = 2\n\u03c3\nE\n[\n1\u03a6>0\n(\n\u03bb(1+\u03a6)\n(\u03bb+\u00b5\u2212\u03b1)\u2206f0,\u03a6(\u03bb+ \u00b5\u2212 \u03b1, v0)\u2212 \u03bb(\u03bb+\u00b5)\u2206f0,\u03a6(\u03bb+ \u00b5, a0 \u2212 \u03b80)\n)]\n.\nii) For every s0 such that 0 < s0 < L\n0,\u2217\n\u03a6 , the optimal hitting time is characterized by its Laplace transform:\nE(e\n\u2212\u00b5\u03c4\nL\n0,\u2217\n0 (\u03a6)) = \u0398(\u03a6) +\n(\ns0\nL0,\u2217\u03a6\n) \u03b80\n\u03c3\n\u00d7 (1 +K (\u03a6))\n9\nwhere\nK (\u03a6) = \u2212F0\n(\ns0, \u03bb, L\n0,\u2217\n\u03a6 , a0\n)\n+F0(s0, \u03bb, L\n0,\u2217\n\u03a6 , a0)E\n[\n1\u03a6<0 (1 + \u03a6)\n\u03b80\n\u03c3\n]\n+ E\n[\n1\u03a6>0 (1 + \u03a6)\n\u03b80\n\u03c3 F\u03a6(s0, \u03bb, L\n0,\u2217\n\u03a6 , a0)\n]\n\u0398(\u03a6) = \u2212 \u03bb\n\u03bb+\u00b5E\n[\n1\u03a6>0 \u00d7\u2206F0,\u03a6(s0, \u03bb+ \u00b5, L0,\u2217\u03a6 , a0 \u2212 \u03b80)\n]\n.\nwhere the various notations used are given in the Appendix in Subsection 6.1.\nProof. As to prove this result, we first consider the following two cases, where \u03a6 is a constant denoted\nby \u03d5, which is either positive (bullish environment) or negative (bearish environment). Finally, the general\nresult is obtained by means of conditional expectation, as it is enough to consider the case where the jump\nsize is a constant, from the independence of the random variable \u03a6 and the filtration generated by the\nBrownian motion and the jump process.\n1) Bullish environment\nAssuming the random variable \u03a6 to be a positive constant \u03d5, we determine the optimal threshold on which\nthe agent bases his decision.\nWe proceed in two steps to obtain L0,\u2217\u03a6 in a bullish framework (with \u03d5 > 0):\nStep 1) The functions F\u03d5 and f\u03d5, defined by Equations (11) and (13) in Subsection 6.1, are linked by the\nrelationship\n\u2200\u03bb > 0,\u2200a \u2208 R, \u2202\n\u2202L\nF\u03d5(s0, \u03bb, L, a)\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223s0 = L = 2\u03c3Lf\u03d5(\u03bb, a) .\nMoreover, function F\u03d5 satisfies F\u03d5(L, \u03bb,L, a) = 0.\nStep 2) We denote by c the following function\nc (s0, L) = E\n[\ne\u2212\u00b5\u03c4L (S\u03c4L \u2212 1)\n]\n.

The proof directly comes from Theorem 7, Lemma 10 and Lemma 11. \u0001\n3.4 Comments\nThe model presented here, and especially the situation Dt = 0 is very different from the existing literature,\nas it corresponds to a non-L\u00e9vy model. The results are therefore different. Note however that if \u03a6 \u2261 0 P\na.s., then all the formulae of this study are similar to those of the \u201dBlack-Scholes\u201d model. The \"interesting\"\nsituation is when Dt is different from 1. Otherwise, the formulae are similar to a standard \u201dBlack-Scholes\u201d-\ntype framework, where no possible jump of the underlying process is introduced (as it is equivalent to have\na shift in the initial condition of our problem). Therefore, we focus on the non-standard results, when\nDt = 0.\nIn this paper, Theorem 7 gives an explicit representation of the optimal boundary without any particular\nassumption either on the sign of the jump \u03a6 or on its distribution. Whether \u03a6 is positive or negative has\na great impact on the structure of the different results since it shapes the optimal frontier differently. In\nfact, both situations are mathematically very different. The main reason is that when the jump is negative,\nthe process S necessarily crosses the given frontier in a continuous way. However, this property does not\nhold any more if the jump is positive. Therefore, involved calculus and obtained results are dissimilar.\nMoreover, the results we obtain are strongly different to those of L\u00e9vy model.\nWhen the jump is negative, even if, the optimal frontier is still of a standard shape:\nL0,\u2217\u03a6 =\n\u03b7\u2212 (\u03a6)\n\u03b7\u2212 (\u03a6)\u2212 1 ,\nboth the Laplace transform and the value of the investment opportunity are different. The standard\nequations for the Laplace transform and the price are perturbed by a multiplicative factor K, this factor\nK being identical to the one in the bullish environment and we have\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\nE(e\n\u2212\u00b5\u03c4\nL\n0,\u2217\n0 (\u03a6)) =\n(\ns0\nL\n0,\u2217\n\u03a6\n) L0,\u2217\u03a6\nL\n0,\u2217\n\u03a6\n\u22121 (1 +K (\u03a6))\nC(0, s0, 0) = ( L\n0,\u2217\n\u03a6 \u2212 1)\n(\ns0\nL\n0,\u2217\n\u03a6\n) L0,\u2217\u03a6\nL\n0,\u2217\n\u03a6\n\u22121 (1 +K (\u03a6))\n11\nThis multiplicative factor comes from the memory of the process used to model the profit and cost ratio.\nObviously, in the limit situation where there is no possible jump (\u03a6 \u2261 0), the results coincide with those\nof the standard \u201dBlack-Scholes\u201d-type framework as K (0) = 0.\nWhen considering a positive jump, we obtain explicit formula for the three characteristics of the investment\nopportunity. The results we obtain are fundamentally different from those of L\u00e9vy models. In particular,\nthe optimal frontier can not be written under the previous standard form (if we except the particular\nlimit case where \u03a6 = 0). Indeed, an additional term \u0393+ (\u03a6) is present in the denominator of the optimal\nfrontier,\nL0,\u2217\u03a6 =\n\u03b7+ (\u03a6)\n\u03b7+ (\u03a6)\u2212 1 + \u0393+ (\u03a6) .\nBoth the Laplace transform and the investment value differ from the standard case by two different effects.\nThere is first a common multiplicative factorK and also two additive factors J \u2032 (for the Laplace transform)\nand J (for the value of the investment):\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\nE(e\n\u2212\u00b5\u03c4\nL\n0,\u2217\n0\n(\u03a6)) = \u0398(\u03a6) +\n(\ns0\nL\n0,\u2217\n\u03a6\n) L0,\u2217\u03a6\nL\n0,\u2217\n\u03a6\n\u22121 (1 +K (\u03a6)) ,\nC(0, s0, 0) = J (\u03a6) + ( L\n0,\u2217\n\u03a6 \u2212 1)\n(\ns0\nL\n0,\u2217\n\u03a6\n) L0,\u2217\u03a6\nL\n0,\u2217\n\u03a6\n\u22121 (1 +K (\u03a6)) .\nThese differences can be explained as follows: as for the bearish case, the factor K comes from the memory\nof the process used to model the profit and cost ratio whereas the additive factors J \u2032 and J translate the\nfact that in this case the optimal boundary L0,\u2217\u03a6 is not necessarily crossed in a continuous way.\n4 Application to a real option problem\nIn this section, we look more precisely at the investment problem (i.e. value of the investment project\nand optimal hitting time) when the investor has no particular knowledge about the type of impact a new\nregulation, a sudden shock may have on the project itself. More precisely, we do not know whether the\nsign of the jump will be positive or negative. This may be the case for investment projects related to new\ntechnologies when the prospects are uncertain. In this case, the related market witnesses a rapid evolution.\nNew regulations can be adopted, modifying its structure. They can generate either a positive impact when\nimproving the security and the transparency (bullish environment) or a negative impact when increasing\nits complexity (bearish environment). New competitors can also enter the market, attracted by these new\nprospects, and actual competitors can default, victims of the lack of experience and speculation. Finally,\nwe may think of new techniques that can be patented either by the considered firm or by competitors.\nIn this section, we focus on the situation at time t = 0 without any loss of generality. In fact, if a new\nregulation is expected, or if some disruptive factor for the economic environment is likely to occur, one\nmay think that the investor will delay his investment decision and wait for the actual occurrence of the\nshock to evaluate the impact on the investment project and to finally take his decision. This delay seems\nto be all the more important so since the potential impact (positive or negative) is unknown. In reality,\nhowever, the investor does not necessarily have the opportunity of delaying his decisions, and often has\nto decide as soon as the investment project appears (that is to say at time t = 0). This pressure may be\ndue to several reasons. In the first place, the investor could face some legal constraints as for instance,\nin the search for concessions or licences (e.g. the universal mobile telecommunications systems (UMTS)\nwhere the investors have to take their decisions before a fixed deadline). The investor can also face some\nmarket and competition constraints, where the postponement of a decision can give to his competitors the\nopportunity of taking a stand and as a consequence, invalidate any possibility of investing in the strategic\nbusiness field for the investor. So considering the study at time t = 0 appears to be relevant for the\ninvestment problem we analyze.\n12\nIn the following, we look at a real option problem in a disrupted framework, as previously described. We\nillustrate the results of section 3 and provide numerical applications. In such a context, one of the most\nimportant questions is certainly related to the calibration of the model. This is all the more important\nso since the shock induces a drastic decrease in the project cash flows. Therefore, we conclude this study\nby looking at the impact of a model misspecification in a bearish environment, i.e. when the impact of a\nshock is to be negative.\n4.1 Illustration\nWe now illustrate the main results of this paper (Theorems 7 and 8) through numerical examples. More\nprecisely, we consider an agent facing an investment problem at time 0, in a potentially disturbed environ-\nment. We focus especially on the sensitivity with respect to the jump size of both the Laplace transform\nof the hitting time and the investment value. The set of parameters we consider is:\n\u03c3 = 0.2 ; \u03b1 = 0.05 ; \u00b5 = 0.15.\nIn the following table we give some values of the optimal profit and cost ratio for different values of the\njump intensity \u03bb and the jump size \u03d5.\nTable 1 : Optimal profit-cost ratio\n\u03d5 \\ \u03bb 0.25 0.5 1 2\n-0.99 1.407617 1.37467 1.364417 1.367871\n-0.8 1.415605 1.382496 1.372175 1.375653\n-0.6 1.443986 1.410464 1.399953 1.403498\n-0.5 1.468846 1.435171 1.424556 1.428139\n-0.4 1.503957 1.470402 1.459746 1.463347\n-0.3 1.553697 1.520998 1.510504 1.514057\n-0.2 1.625893 1.595907 1.586132 1.58945\n-0.1 1.735855 1.713473 1.705999 1.708546\n-0.05 1.814285 1.800001 1.795146 1.796805\n0 1.917891 1.917891 1.917891 1.917891\n0.05 2.061146 2.098451 2.13082 2.165905\n0.1 2.259259 2.38787 2.545456\n0.15 2.530455 2.851521\n0.2 2.90661 3.639258\n0.25 3.446203\n0.3 4.267252\n0.35 5.645627\n0.4 8.406155\nThe optimal ratio is monotonic with respect to the jump size \u03d5.

The same result holds for the investment value.\n14\n4.2 Misspecification impact in a bearish environment\nAssume now that the agent who does not know the (negative) random jump size \u03a6, can however estimate\nit by its expectation E (\u03a6). The question is then if he takes his investment decision by considering only\nthe expected value, how will his decision be impacted, in particular his investment timing: will he invest\ntoo early or too late in the project? Note that the value of the investment project is obviously reduced\nsince C(0, s0, 0) is determined by using an optimal frontier satisfying the supremum:\nC(0, s0, 0) = ess sup\nL0\u22651\nE\n(\ne\u2212\u00b5\u03c4L0\n(\nS\u03c4L0 \u2212 1\n)+\n\/ S0 = s0\n)\nAny other frontier (in particular the level obtained by considering the expected value of the jump size\ninstead of the random variable) is sub-optimal, and the supremum is not reached for this particular value.\nLet us first focus on the optimal level of benefit and cost ratio when the agent considers the expected\nvalue as the estimate for the jump size. We establish that such a misspecification leads the investor to\nundervalue the optimal level of the benefit\/cost ratio since:\nProposition 9 Using previous notations, we have\nL0,\u2217\u03a6 \u2265 L0,\u2217E(\u03a6).\nProof. Let g be the function defined as g(\u03b8) = 12\u03b8\n2 + \u03b8\n\u03c3\n(\n\u03b1\u2212 \u03c322\n)\n\u2212 \u00b5.\nBoth inequalities 0 < \u03b80 and 0 \u2264 \u03b1 < \u00b5 and the equalities g(\u03b80) = 0 and g(\u03c3) = \u03b1 \u2212 \u00b5 imply \u03b80\u03c3 > 1.\nHence, by Jensen\u2019s inequality, we deduce\nE\n(\n(1 + \u03a6)\n\u03b80\n\u03c3\n)\n\u2265 (1 + E(\u03a6))\n\u03b80\n\u03c3 .\nOn the other hand, we have:\nf0(\u03bb, a) \u2265 0, \u2200\u03bb > 0, \u2200a \u2208 R .\nSo, from Theorem 7, we may conclude:\nL0,\u2217\u03a6 \u2265 L0,\u2217E(\u03a6) .\n\u0001\nTherefore, assuming that the agent chooses his investment time according to L0,\u2217\nE(\u03a6), he will enter the\nproject as soon as the benefit\/cost ratio reaches this threshold (instead of using the optimal threshold\nL0,\u2217\u03a6 ). In that sense, it can be said that the model misspecification leads them to undertake the project too\nearly. More precisely, the agent has some beliefs regarding the dynamics of the random benefit\/cost ratio.\nHe knows perfectly its dynamics when his information is perfect or has simply an estimation when his\naccess to the information is limited. Given his beliefs, the agent is able to explicitly determine the optimal\nratio and therefore his investment strategy using this ratio as the threshold to take his decision. He has\nno better way to decide when it is optimal to invest, as the knowledge of the dynamics of S simply gives\nhis the Laplace transform of the optimal investment time and therefore simply a heuristic determination\nof an average investment time (see for instance Barrieu and Bellamy (2004)).\n5 Conclusion\nIn this paper, We provide closed-form formulae for the different characteristics of a perpetual option in\na framework where the uncertainty is brought by a Brownian motion and a point process with stochastic\nintensity. An application of these results to a real option problem is then presented. More precisely,\nassuming that a unique shock occurs in the context of an investment project, we studied the investment\nproblem when the project\u2019s environment can be subject to a brutal and fundamental change (for instance, in\n15\nthe regulation or in its competitors\u2019 strengths and numbers). Mathematically speaking, all these situations\nare similar and are equivalent to consider a single jump diffusion process. The aim has been to study the\nimpact of such a market perturbation on the decision. More precisely, assuming that the investor has a\nbudget allocation problem at time 0, he has to determine whether the project is interesting and if so, to\nhave some ideas of the optimal investment time as to allocate his capital among financial instruments with\ndifferent maturities. In this framework, the investor determines his strategy at time 0 by characterizing the\noptimal profit\/cost ratio, and then has some anticipations about the optimal time to invest in the project\nby looking at the Laplace transform at time 0 of the first hitting time of this optimal ratio. We have\nobtained closed-form formulae for the optimal benefit\/cost ratio, the investment value and the optimal\ntime to enter the project, without any assumption on the distribution of the jump size and with arbitrary\npositive or negative jump.\nThe framework of the investment problem studied in this paper can be extended. For example, it is also\npossible to consider an investment environment that could be potentially by different shocks. In this case,\nthe profit\/cost ratio is then written on the following form\ndSt = St\u2212\n(\n\u03b1dt+ \u03c3dWt +\ni=k\u2211\ni=1\n\u03a6idDit\n)\n,\nwhere Dit = 1t\u2265Ti and T1, T2\u2212T3, ..., Tk\u2212Tk\u22121 is an increasing sequence of independent random variables\nwith exponential law, the parameter of Ti \u2212 Ti\u22121 being \u03bbi . Such an extension seems rather natural as\nit leads to a framework allowing for different impacts of different natures on the investment field. In this\nsense, the uncertainty prevailing in investment problems could be represented.\n6 Appendix\n6.1 Notation\nWe give a series of various notations which are used throughout the paper. In spite of being rather heavy,\nthese notations are as simplified as possible and allow us to give explicit formulae for the different quantities\ncharacterizing the investment project.\ni) Let N be the cumulative distribution of the Gaussian law :\nN (x) = 1\u221a\n2\u03c0\nx\u222b\n\u2212\u221e\ne\u2212\nt2\n2 dt .\nii) For s0 > 0, \u03bd > 0, L \u2265 1, \u03d5 \u2265 0 and a in R, let F\u03d5(\u03bd, L, a) be defined as\nF\u03d5(s0, \u03bd, L, a) =\n+\u221e\u222b\n0\n\u03bde\u2212\u03bdtN\n(\n1\n\u03c3\n\u221a\nt\nln( L\ns0(1+\u03d5)\n)\u2212 a\u221at\n)\ndt\n\u2212\n(\nL\ns0\n) 2a\n\u03c3 +\u221e\u222b\n0\n\u03bde\u2212\u03bdtN\n(\n\u2212 1\n\u03c3\n\u221a\nt\nln(L(1+\u03d5)\ns0\n)\u2212 a\u221at\n)\ndt\n(11)\nand \u2206F0,\u03d5(s0, \u03bd, L, a) is defined by\n\u2206F0,\u03d5(s0, \u03bd, L, a) = F\u03d5(s0, \u03bd, L, a)\u2212 F0(s0, \u03bd, L, a) .
