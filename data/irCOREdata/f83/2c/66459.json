They can be obtained from the hadron\u2019s\nBethe-Salpeter equation by integration over the transverse momentum distribution, but\nkeeping track of the longitudinal momentum fraction u:\n\u03c6(u) \u223c\n\u222b\nk2\u22a5<\u00b5\n2\nd2k\u22a5\u03c6(u, k\u22a5).\nDAs enter the amplitudes of processes to which collinear factorisation theorems apply and\nwhich notably include \u201cclassical\u201d applications like the EM form factor of the pion or the\n\u03b3\u03b3\u2217-\u03c0 transition form factor, which were first discussed in the seminal papers by Brodsky,\nLepage and others [1]. More recently, collinear factorisation has been shown to apply, to\nleading order in an expansion in 1\/mb, also to a large class of nonleptonic B decays [2],\nwhich has opened a new and exciting area of applications of meson DAs: nonleptonic B\ndecays, and in particular CP asymmetries in these decays, are currently being studied at\nthe B factories BaBar and Belle and are expected to yield essential information about the\npattern of CP violation and potential sources of flavour violation beyond the SM. DAs\nalso enter crucially SCET, the soft-collinear effective theory [3], which aims to provide a\nunified theoretical framework for the factorisation of both hard-collinear effects, relevant\nfor all hard exclusive QCD processes, and soft effects, which occur in processes involving\nheavy mesons.\nFor light mesons, on which we shall concentrate in this paper, leading twist DAs can\nbe interpreted as probability amplitudes of finding the meson in a state with a minimum\nnumber of Fock constituents and at small transverse separation which provides an ultra-\nviolet cut-off. The dependence on the this cut-off \u00b5 is given by Brodsky-Lepage evolution\nequations and can be calculated in perturbative QCD, while the DAs at a certain low scale\nprovide the necessary nonperturbative input for a rigorous QCD treatment of exclusive\nreactions with large momentum transfer.\nAs exclusive QCD processes come with much smaller cross-sections or branching ra-\ntios than inclusive processes, they are not as well studied experimentally as their inclusive\ncounterparts. The overall normalisations of DAs are given by local hadronic matrix el-\nements, essentially decay constants, which are partly accessible experimentally, partly\nhave to be calculated from theory. Information on the shape of DAs comes mostly from\ntheory and has been the subject of numerous studies within various nonperturbative ap-\nproaches. There are a few, mostly exploratory, studies of the second momentum of the\npion DA in lattice QCD, Ref. [4], but the results are not yet refined enough to be relevant\nfor phenomenology. Most of the existing information on light meson DAs comes from\nQCD sum rules, whose application to the study of moments of DAs has been pioneered\nby Chernyak and Zhitnitsky. Their review on the \u201cAsymptotic Behavior Of Exclusive\nProcesses In QCD\u201d, Ref. [5], is still a very useful source of information, despite having\nbeen written 20 years ago. Later analyses switched from the calculation of moments to\nthat of Gegenbauer moments which, as we shall discuss in Sec. 2, are more appropriate\nfor the study of DAs. The leading-twist DA of the pion was analysed in Ref. [6], while\nthose of the \u03c1 were studied in Ref. [7]. The first paper to study SU(3) breaking effects in\n1\nmoments was Ref. [8], while the first two Gegenbauer moments of the K\u2217 and \u03a6 meson\nDAs were calculated in Ref. [9].\nThe aim of the present paper is to provide a careful analysis of SU(3) breaking effects\nin leading-twist K and K\u2217 DAs, using QCD sum rules. The motivation for this study\nis the need for a more accurate assessment of these effects than presented in the papers\nquoted above. This need is driven by the fact that DAs are crucial ingredients in the\nanalysis of B decays of type B \u2192 \u03c0K etc., which are presently being measured at the\nB factories. In the future, accurate information on SU(3) breaking effects in DAs will\nalso be required for assessing the reliability of phenomenological methods for relating, via\nU-spin symmetry, amplitudes of Bd decays to those of Bs decays which will be measured\nat the Tevatron and the LHC. SU(3) breaking enters these processes in essentially three\ndifferent ways:\n\u2022 via an asymmetry of the DAs under the exchange of quark and antiquark;\n\u2022 via SU(3) breaking in the symmetric parts of the DA, in particular the overall\nnormalisation;\n\u2022 via form factors, e.g. FB\u2192\u03c0 vs. FB\u2192K .\nAlthough in the present paper we will concentrate on the first two manifestations of SU(3)\nbreaking, our results can be used immediately for an update of B \u2192 K,K\u2217 form factors\nusing QCD sum rules on the light-cone (cf. [10] for the present state of the art).\nOur paper is organised as follows: Sec. 2 contains the definition of all relevant DAs as\nwell as a discussion of their behaviour under a change of renormalisation scale. In Sec. 3\nwe discuss QCD sum rules for the DAs, obtain numerical results and compare with the\nresults of other studies. Section 4 presents a summary and our conclusions. Issues of a\nmore technical nature are discussed in the appendices.\n2 General Framework\n2.1 Definitions\nWe define the light-cone DAs via matrix elements of quark-antiquark gauge-invariant\nnonlocal operators at light-like separations z\u00b5 with z\n2 = 0 [5]. For definiteness we consider\nthe K(\u2217)\u2212 meson distributions; the DAs of the neutral mesons containing an s quark just\ninvolve a trivial isospin factor 1\/\n\u221a\n2 in the overall normalisation. For mesons containing\nan s antiquark, one has \u03c6(s\u00afq)(u) = \u03c6(q\u00afs)(1 \u2212 u). The complete set of distributions to\nleading-twist accuracy involves three DAs (we use the notation z\u02c6 = z\u00b5\u03b3\u00b5 for arbitrary\n4-vectors z):\n\u30080|u\u00af(z)z\u02c6\u03b35[z, 0]s(0)|K\u2212(q)\u3009 = ifK(q \u00b7 z)\n\u222b 1\n0\ndu e\u2212iu\u00af(q\u00b7z)\u03c6K(u) ,\n\u30080|u\u00af(z)z\u02c6[z, 0]s(0)|K\u2217\u2212(q, \u03bb)\u3009 = (e(\u03bb)z)f \u2016KmK\u2217\n\u222b 1\n0\ndu e\u2212iu\u00af(q\u00b7z)\u03c6\n\u2016\nK(u),\n2\n\u30080|u\u00af(z)\u03c3\u00b5\u03bd [z, 0]s(0)|K\u2217\u2212(q, \u03bb)\u3009 = i(e(\u03bb)\u00b5 q\u03bd \u2212 e(\u03bb)\u03bd q\u00b5)f\u22a5K(\u00b5)\n\u222b 1\n0\ndu e\u2212iu\u00af(q\u00b7z)\u03c6\u22a5K(u), (2.1)\nwith the Wilson-line\n[z, 0] = Pexp\n[\nig\n\u222b 1\n0\nd\u03b1 z\u00b5A\u00b5(\u03b1z)\n]\ninserted between quark fields to render the matrix elements gauge-invariant. In the above\ndefinitions, e\n(\u03bb)\n\u03bd is the polarization vector of a vector meson with polarisation \u03bb; there\nare two DAs for vector mesons, corresponding to longitudinal and transverse polarisation,\nrespectively. The integration variable u is the meson momentum fraction carried by the\nquark, u\u00af \u2261 1 \u2212 u the momentum fraction carried by the antiquark. The normalisation\nconstants fK are defined by the local limit of Eqs. (2.1) and chosen in such a way that\u222b 1\n0\ndu \u03c6(u) = 1 (2.2)\nfor all the three distributions \u03c6K , \u03c6\n\u2016\nK , \u03c6\n\u22a5\nK .\n2.2 Conformal Expansion and Renormalisation\nThe conformal expansion of light-cone distribution amplitudes is analogous to the partial\nwave expansion of wave functions in standard quantum mechanics. In conformal expan-\nsion, the invariance of massless QCD under conformal transformations is the equivalent\nof rotational symmetry in quantum mechanics, where, for spherically symmetric poten-\ntials, the partial wave decomposition serves to separate angular degrees of freedom from\nradial ones. All dependence on the angular coordinates is included in spherical harmonics\nwhich form an irreducible representation of the group O(3), and the dependence on the\nsingle remaining radial coordinate is governed by a one-dimensional Schro\u00a8dinger equation.\nSimilarly, the conformal expansion of distribution amplitudes in QCD aims to separate\nlongitudinal degrees of freedom from transverse ones. All dependence on the longitudinal\nmomentum fractions is described by orthogonal polynomials that form an irreducible rep-\nresentation of the so-called collinear subgroup of the conformal group, SL(2,R), describing\nMo\u00a8bius transformations on the light-cone. The transverse-momentum dependence (scale-\ndependence) is governed by simple renormalisation group equations: the different partial\nwaves, labelled by different \u201cconformal spins\u201d, behave independently and do not mix with\neach other. Since the conformal invariance of QCD is broken by quantum corrections,\nmixing between different terms of the conformal expansion is absent only to leading log-\narithmic accuracy. Still, conformal spin is a good quantum number in hard processes, up\nto small corrections of order \u03b12s. The application of conformal symmetry to the study\nof exclusive processes to leading twist has become a vast field whose current status is\nreviewed in Ref. [11].\nSince quark mass terms break the conformal symmetry of the QCD Lagrangian explic-\nitly one might, at first glance, expect difficulties to incorporate SU(3) breaking corrections\ninto the formalism. In fact, however, the inclusion of quark mass corrections is straight-\nforward and generates two types of effects. First, matrix elements of conformal operators\nare modified and in general do not have the symmetry of the massless theory. This is\n3\nnot a \u201cproblem\u201d, since the conformal expansion is designed to simplify the transverse\nmomentum dependence of the wave functions by relating it to the scale dependence of the\nrelevant operators. This dependence is given by operator anomalous dimensions which are\nnot affected by quark masses, provided they are smaller than the scales involved. Second,\nnew higher twist operators arise, in which quark masses multiply operators of lower twist.\nThese additional operators generate contributions to higher twist DAs, which have been\ndiscussed in [9] and are irrelevant for the present investigation.\nThe conformal expansion of DAs is especially simple when each constituent field has\na fixed (Lorentz) spin projection onto the light-cone. In this case, its conformal spin is\nj =\n1\n2\n(l + s), (2.3)\nwhere l is the canonical dimension and s the (Lorentz) spin projection. Multi-particle\nstates built of constituent fields can be expanded in increasing conformal spin: the lowest\npossible spin equals the sum of spins of the constituents, and its \u201cwave function\u201d is given\nby the product of one-particle states. This state is nondegenerate and cannot mix with\nother states because of conformal symmetry. Its evolution is given by a simple renormali-\nsation group equation and the corresponding anomalous dimension is the smallest one in\nthe spectrum. This state is the only one to survive in the limit Q2 \u2192 \u221e and is usually\nreferred to as \u201casymptotic distribution amplitude\u201d.\nAs for the leading-twist quark-antiquark DAs we are interested in, the partial wave\nexpansion reads\n\u03c6(u) = 6uu\u00af\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\nanC\n3\/2\nn (2u\u2212 1), (2.4)\nwhere C\n3\/2\nn (2u\u22121) are Gegenbauer polynomials. The dimension of quark fields is l = 3\/2\nand the leading twist distribution corresponds to positive spin projection s = +1\/2 for\nboth the quark and the antiquark. Thus, according to (2.3), the conformal spin of each\nfield is jq = jq\u00af = 1; the asymptotic distribution amplitude is 6uu\u00af. The Gegenbauer poly-\nnomials correspond to contributions with higher conformal spin j + n and are orthogonal\nover the weight function 6uu\u00af.\nNote that a0 = 1 due to the normalisation condition (2.2). In the limit of exactly\nmassless quarks only terms with even n survive in Eq. (2.4) because of G-parity invari-\nance. The conformal expansion, however, can be performed at the operator level and is\ndisconnected from particular symmetries of states such as G-parity. The expansion (2.4)\nis, therefore, valid for arbitrary n, and it is precisely the odd contributions to the expan-\nsion which, being proportional to manifestly SU(3) breaking effects like the difference of\nquark masses, induce the most tangible SU(3) breaking effects.\nAs mentioned before, conformal invariance implies that partial waves with different\nconformal spin do not mix under renormalisation to leading-order accuracy, which means\nthat the Gegenbauer moments an in (2.4) renormalise multiplicatively:\nan(\u00b5) = an(\u00b50)\n(\n\u03b1s(\u00b5)\n\u03b1s(\u00b50)\n)(\u03b3(n)\u2212\u03b3(0))\/\u03b20\n(2.5)\n4\nwith \u03b20 = 11\u2212 (2\/3)nf . The one-loop anomalous dimensions are [12]\n\u03b3(n) = \u03b3\n\u2016\n(n) = CF\n(\n1\u2212 2\n(n+ 1)(n+ 2)\n+ 4\nn+1\u2211\nj=2\n1\/j\n)\n,\n\u03b3\u22a5(n) = CF\n(\n1 + 4\nn+1\u2211\nj=2\n1\/j\n)\n. (2.6)\n\u03b3(0) is the anomalous dimension of the local current and vanishes for vector and axialvector\ncurrents. Note that the DAs of the pseudoscalar K and the longitudinally polarised K\u2217\nhave the same anomalous dimensions. As the \u03b3\u2019s are positive and increase with n, the\neffect of running to large scales is to damp the effects of higher-order Gegenbauers, so\nthat the DAs approach their asymptotic shape. From the above-stated scaling-properties,\nit is evident that a discussion of the shape of DAs is most conveniently done in terms of\nGegenbauer moments.\n3 QCD Sum Rules for Moments\n3.1 QCD Sum Rules\nAs QCD sum rules constitute an established method for the calculation of static hadro-\nnic matrix elements like decay constants (as opposed to dynamical quantities like form\nfactors), we refrain from delving into a comprehensive explanation of technicalities, for\nwhich we refer to the original papers [13] and to recent reviews [14] instead. The key\nfeature of the method is the use of analyticity to relate the local short-distance operator\nproduct expansion (OPE) of a correlation function of two currents,\n\u03a0 = i\n\u222b\nd4yeiqy\u30080|TJ1(y)J2(0)|0\u3009 =\n\u2211\nn\nCn(q\n2)\u3008On\u3009 \u2261 \u03a0OPE (3.1)\naround y = 0 (as opposed to a light-cone expansion aound y2 = 0, which is appropriate\nfor form factor calculations, cf. [10]) valid for Q2 \u2261 \u2212q2 \u226a 0, to its dispersion relation in\nterms of hadronic contributions,\n\u03a0 =\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nds\n\u03c1(s)\ns\u2212 q2 \u2212 i0 \u2261 \u03a0\nhad, (3.2)\nwhere \u03c1(s) is the spectral density of the correlation function along its physical cut. The\nOPE yields a series of local operators of increasing dimension whose expectation values\n\u3008On\u3009 in the nonperturbative (physical) vacuum are the so-called condensates. In the sum\nrules analysed in this paper, we take into account the condensates listed in Tab. 1. The\nrepresentation of the correlation function in terms of hadronic matrix elements can be\nwritten as\n\u03c1(s) = f\u03b4(s\u2212m2M) + \u03c1cont(s),\n5\n\u3008q\u00afq\u3009= (\u22120.24\u00b1 0.01)3GeV3 \u3008s\u00afs\u3009= (0.8\u00b1 0.1) \u3008q\u00afq\u3009\u2329\n\u03b1s\n\u03c0\nG2\n\u232a\n= (0.012\u00b1 0.006)GeV4\n\u3008q\u00af\u03c3gGq\u3009= (0.8\u00b1 0.1)GeV2 \u3008q\u00afq\u3009 \u3008s\u00af\u03c3gGs\u3009= (0.8\u00b1 0.1)\u3008q\u00af\u03c3gGq\u3009\nms(2GeV) = (110\u00b1 20)MeV \u2190\u2192 ms(1GeV) = (149\u00b1 27)MeV\n\u03b1s(1GeV) = 0.513 \u2190\u2192 \u039b(3)NLOQCD = 372MeV\nTable 1: Input parameters for sum rules at the renormalisation scale \u00b5 = 1GeV. The\nvalue of ms is obtained from quenched lattice calculations as summarised in [15].\nwhere mM is the mass of the lowest-lying state coupling to the currents J1,2 and \u03c1\ncont\nparametrises all contributions to the correlation function apart from the ground state. f ,\nthe residue of the ground state pole is the quantity one wants to determine. A QCD sum\nrule that allows one to do so is obtained by equating the representations (3.1) and (3.2)\nand implementing the following (model) assumptions:\n\u2022 \u03c1cont is approximated by the spectral density obtained from the OPE above a certain\nthreshold, i.e. \u03c1cont \u2192 \u03c1OPE(s)\u03b8(s\u2212 s0) with s0 \u2248 (mM +\u2206)2 being the continuum\nthreshold, where \u2206 \u223c O(\u039bQCD) is an excitation energy to be determined within the\nmethod. This assumption relies on the validity of global quark-hadron duality;\n\u2022 instead of the weight-functions 1\/(q2)n and 1\/(s \u2212 q2), one uses different weight-\nfunctions which are optimised to (exponentially) suppress effects of \u03c1(s) for large\nvalues of s and at the same time also suppress high-dimensional condensates by\nfactorials. This is achieved by Borel transforming the correlation function: B 1\/(s\u2212\nq2) = 1\/M2 exp(\u2212s\/M2). A window of viable values of the Borel parameter M2\nand the continuum threshold s0 has to be determined within the method itself by\nlooking for a maximum region of minimum sensitivity (a plateau) in both M2 and\ns0;\n\u2022 the OPE of \u03a0 can be truncated after a few terms. As we shall see (and as is well\nknown), this condition is fulfilled only for low Gegenbauer moments.\nAfter subtraction of the integral over \u03c1OPE above s0 from both sides, the final sum rule\nreads\nBsub\u03a0OPE \u2261 1\nM2\n\u222b s0\n0\nds e\u2212s\/M\n2\n\u03c1OPE(s) =\nf\nM2\ne\u2212m\n2\nM\n\/M2 , (3.3)\nwhich gives the hadronic quantity f as a function of the Borel parameter M2 and the\ncontinuum threshold s0 (and the condensates and short-distance parameters from the\nOPE).\nEven Gegenbauer moments can be determined from diagonal correlation functions of\ntype\ni\n\u222b\nd4yeiqy\u30080|T q\u00af(y)\u0393s(y)s\u00af(0)\u0393[0, z]q(z)|0\u3009, (3.4)\n6\nwith a suitably chosen Dirac structure \u0393. This form of the correlation function differs\nfrom Refs. [5, 7], where local operators with an arbitrary number of covariant derivatives\nwere used rather than the nonlocal operator s\u00af(0)\u0393[0, z]q(z). We find the calculation with\nnonlocal operators very convenient, as it allows one to calculate all moments in one go.\nSpecifying for instance to K\u2217\u2016 , the sum rule reads\nBsub\u03a0OPE = (f \u2016K)2 e\u2212m\n2\nK\u2217\n\/M2 1\nM2\n\u222b 1\n0\ndu eiu\u00af(q\u00b7z)\u03c6\n\u2016\nK(u), (3.5)\nwhere also \u03a0OPE is expressed as integral over u, which naturally emerges as Feynman\nparameter in the calculation, and comes with the same weight function exp(iu\u00af(q \u00b7 z)).\nSum rules for individual Gegenbauer moments are obtained by expanding both sides in\npowers of (q \u00b7 z), or effectively replacing\neiu\u00af(q\u00b7z) \u2192 C3\/2n (2u\u2212 1),\n\u222b 1\n0\ndu eiu\u00af(q\u00b7z)\u03c6\n\u2016\nK(u)\u2192\n3(n+ 1)(n+ 2)\n2(2n+ 3)\na\u2016n.\nFor odd moments, one analyses nondiagonal correlation functions of type\ni\n\u222b\nd4yeiqy\u30080|T q\u00af(y)\u03932s(y)s\u00af(0)\u03931[0, z]q(z)|0\u3009 (3.6)\nwith structures \u03931 and \u03932 of opposite chirality [8, 5]. The \u0393i appropriate for K, K\n\u2217\n\u2016 and\nK\u2217\u22a5 are given in App. A, where we also give complete expressions for perturbative and\nquark-condensate contributions to O(\u03b1s), as well as tree-expressions for the dimension 5\nmixed condensate.\nFormulas for the correlation functions and Gegenbauer moments are collected in the\nappendices. Note in particular the scaling of different contributions to the Gegenbauer\nmoments in n, the order of the moment: nonperturbative terms increase with positive\npowers of n with respect to the perturbative contribution. For large n, this behaviour\nupsets the usual hierarchy of contributions to the OPE, where nonperturbative terms\nare expected to be a moderately sized correction to the leading term. The origin of this\nbehaviour can be easily understood from the fact that in the local expansion the vacuum\nfields have exactly zero momentum, which yields the \u03b4-function terms in (A.3) and (A.4).\nThis amounts to a multipole expansion of the DA around its endpoints, which is justified\nif one is only interested in gross features of the DA, like the first few moments, but which\nis clearly inappropriate for extracting more detailed information on the shape. In the\npresent paper we adopt the viewpoint that at least the first two Gegenbauer moments\ncan be reliably obtained from local sum rules of the type discussed above.\n3.2 A Short Discussion of Decay Constants and Lattice Results\nThe decay constant of the pseudoscalar K meson is well known from K+ \u2192 \u00b5+\u03bd\u00b5(+\u03b3)\nand quoted as [16]\nfK = (159.8\u00b1 1.3)MeV.\n7\nThe decay constant f\n\u2016\nK can be extracted from the branching ratio of \u03c4\n\u2212 \u2192 K\u2217\u2212\u03bd\u03c4 via\nB(\u03c4\u2212 \u2192 K\u2217\u2212\u03bd\u03c4 ) = G\n2\nFm\u03c4 |Vus|2\n8\u03c0\n\u03c4\u03c4m\n2\nK\u2217(f\n\u2016\nK)\n2\n(\n1 +\nm2\u03c4\n2m2K\u2217\n)(\n1\u2212 m\n2\nK\u2217\nm2\u03c4\n)2\n.\nWith |Vus| = 0.220 and the other parameters taken from [16], one finds\nf\n\u2016\nK = (217\u00b1 5)MeV.\nIt is interesting to compare this value with a \u201cpostdiction\u201d from QCD sum rules. We use\nthe sum rule quoted as (C.4) in [9] with the input parameters as in Tab. 1. From the\nresult plotted in Fig. 1 we conclude\nf\n\u2016\nK\n(SR) = (225\u00b1 7)MeV\nand s0 = (1.8 \u00b1 0.1)GeV2. The plateau in M2 extends from 1 to 2 GeV2. Although\nthe error only includes the impact of varying the input parameters of Tab. 1 within their\nrespective ranges and does not account for any systematic uncertainties, the agreement\nwith the experimental result is remarkably good.\nThe value of the third constant, f\u22a5K , has not been measured yet, but has been calculated\nin quenched lattice QCD and from QCD sum rules. The lattice result for the ratio of the\nK\u2217 decay constants is [17]\nf\u22a5K(2GeV)\nf\n\u2016\nK\n= 0.739(17).\nFrom QCD sum rules, on the other hand, we find, cf. Fig. 2,\nf\u22a5K(1GeV)\nf\n\u2016\nK\n= 0.84(03) \u2190\u2192 f\n\u22a5\nK(2GeV)\nf\n\u2016\nK\n= 0.74(03),\nusing the formulas (C.4) and (C.5) in [9], which include NLO radiative corrections. The\noptimum continuum threshold for f\u22a5K turns out to be s0 = (1.2 \u00b1 0.1)GeV2. The fact\nthat s0 for K\n\u2217\n\u22a5 is smaller than for K\n\u2217\n\u2016 is in agreement with the findings of Ref. [7] and\nrelated to the fact that, with the Dirac structure \u0393 chosen as specified in App. B, the\nsum rule does not only receive contributions from K\u2217, but also from the ground state in\nthe opposite parity channel, the 1+ state K1(1270). This contribution has to be included\nin the continuum, which results in a low value of s0. Note that this is not an external\ncondition imposed by us when evaluating the sum rule, but emerges naturally from the\ncriterion of stability and the presence of a plateau in M2. We consider the ratio of\ndecay constants rather than the constants themselves, as effects of unknown higher order\ncorrections are expected to cancel in the ratio. The sum rules are evaluated at the low\nscale 1 GeV and the scaling from 1 to 2 GeV is done using NLO renormalisation group\nimprovement. Note that the dependence on the Borel parameter largely cancels in the\nratio of decay constants and also the dependence on s0 is rather mild. The agreement\nwith the lattice results is remarkably good. Using the experimental value for f\n\u2016\nK , QCD\nsum rules hence predict, to NLO accuracy and including 2-loop running,\nf\u22a5K(1GeV) = (182\u00b1 10)MeV, f\u22a5K(2GeV) = (160\u00b1 9)MeV,\nf\u22a5K(4.8GeV) = (149\u00b1 8)MeV.

Previous determinations\ngo back to Refs. [5, 9], where the following values were obtained:\na1(1GeV) = 0.17, a\n\u2016\n1(1GeV) = 0.19\u00b1 0.05, a\u22a51 (1GeV) = 0.20\u00b1 0.05.\nThese results are valid at LO in QCD and were obtained using QCD sum rules which,\nunfortunately, partly suffered from mistakes. In particular, we find a different sign of\nthe perturbative contribution w.r.t. the formulas given in Ref. [5, 9]. We have carefully\nchecked that the sign we obtain is indeed the correct one: for the nth Gegenbauer moment,\nthe leading order perturbative contribution is the same for all three correlation functions\n9\n-0.45\n-0.4\n-0.35\n-0.3\n-0.25\n-0.2\n-0.15\n-0.1\n-0.05\n0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2\na 1\n(1G\neV\n)\n2M  [GeV]2\nFigure 3: a1(1GeV) as function of the Borel parameter M\n2.

Due to the change in sign of\nthe perturbative contribution, the leading order sum rule becomes numerically unstable:\nperturbation theory and the mixed condensate yield negative contributions, the quark\ncondensate a positive one, and the sum is close to zero. This is in stark contrast to the\nstatement made in Ref. [5], according to which the sum rule is dominated by the quark\ncondensate contribution and yields a positive result for all a1.\nThe different signs of individual contributions, together with the fact that none of them\nis numerically dominant, entails that no meaningful result can be extracted from the lead-\ning order sum rule. The situation improves, however, if one includes radiative corrections.\nWe have calculated O(\u03b1s) corrections to both the perturbative and the quark condensate\ncontribution and find that they reduce the size of the quark condensate contribution, but\nincrease that of the perturbative contribution. As a result, the perturbative contribution\nbecomes numerically dominant, as is actually expected for a \u201cgood\u201d sum rule. By varying\nall the input parameters of Tab. 1 within their respective ranges we obtain\na1(1GeV) = \u22120.18\u00b10.09, a\u20161(1GeV) = \u22120.4\u00b10.2, a\u22a51 (1GeV) = \u22120.34\u00b10.18. (3.8)\nThe Borel window is taken to be 1 to 2GeV2, as motivated by the results of the previous\nsubsection. Note that the l.h.s. of the sum rules for a\n\u2016,\u22a5\n1 contains the factor f\n\u2016\nKf\n\u22a5\nK , which\nwe substitute by their respective sum rules instead of using the values determined in the\nprevious subsection, the reason being that one expects unknown higher order corrections\nto cancel in the ratio. The dependence of the individual sum rules on the input parameters\nis plotted in Figs. 3, 4 and 5. The error bars in (3.8) are rather large, which is due to\nthe fact that the first Gegenbauer moments are explicitly proportional to SU(3) breaking\nquantities, i.e. ms or the difference of condensates, e.g. \u3008q\u00afq\u3009 \u2212 \u3008s\u00afs\u3009, which come with a\nconsiderable uncertainty.\nWe would also like to add that the use of nondiagonal sum rules has been met with\ncriticism. It has been argued in Ref. [18] that these sum rules may suffer from large\ncontributions of higher resonances or, in the case of theK, from instanton contributions to\nthe pseudoscalar current. We can actually estimate the amount of possible contamination\nof these sum rules by studying their local limit, yielding a0, which is 1 by definition.\nIn Fig. 6 we plot the sum rules for a0 for both the K and the K\n\u2217 (there is only one\nsum rule for the K\u2217), for central values of the input parameters, s0 = 1.2GeV\n2 for K\u2217,\ns0 = 1.8GeV\n2 for the K, and replacing f\n\u22a5,\u2016\nK in the denominator by their respective sum\nrules. The plot shows no sizeable contamination for the K, and a moderate one for the\nK\u2217; both results lie in the ball-park of the expected accuracy of QCD sum rules and\ncome with uncertainties from the input parameters, in particular for a0 of the K, which is\ndirectly proportional to ms. Radiative corrections are important in both cases and drag\nthe result closer to a0 = 1. This result strengthens our confidence in the suitability of\nnondiagonal sum rules for extracting meaningful values of a1.\n11\n11.05\n1.1\n1.15\n1.2\n1.25\n1.3\n1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2\n2M  [GeV]2\nFigure 6: a0 from nondiagonal sum rules for K (lower curve) and K\n\u2217 (upper curve) for\ncentral values of input parameters.\n3.4 The Gegenbauer Moment a2\nSum rules for even moments and the effects of SU(3) breaking have been studied in var-\nious papers, e.g. [8, 5, 9]. None of these papers, however, does contain a complete set of\nsum rules for Gegenbauer moments. Moreover, while checking our two-loop and nonper-\nturbative calculations against the formulas collected in Ref. [9], we found that the terms\nin ms\u3008s\u00af\u03c3gGs\u3009, given correctly in Ref. [5] for the moments of K(\u2217), have not been correctly\ntranslated into Gegenbauer moments in Ref. [9]; we have calculated these contributions\nanew for all three DAs, using nonlocal currents, and confirm the results of Ref. [5]. We\nhave also recalculated the four-quark contributions and confirm the expressions quoted in\n[9]. The complete set of (hopefully) correct sum rules is given in App. B.\nWith the input parameters from Tab. 1 we obtain\na2(1GeV) = 0.16\u00b1 0.10, a\u20162(1GeV) = 0.09\u00b1 0.05, a\u22a52 (1GeV) = 0.13\u00b1 0.08 (3.9)\nby varying all the input parameters of Tab. 1 within their respective ranges. These\nnumbers have to be compared with those quoted in the first reference in [10] and in\nRef. [9]:\na2(1GeV) = 0.2, a\n\u2016\n2(1GeV) = 0.06\u00b1 0.06, a\u22a52 (1GeV) = 0.04\u00b1 0.04.\nThe discrepancy to (3.9) is mainly due to the wrong expressions for the contribution of\nthe \u3008s\u00af\u03c3gGs\u3009 condensate used in [9].\nLike for a1, the relative errors of the moments (3.9) are considerably larger than the\nones quoted for the decay constants. The reason is the absence of a stability plateau\nin M2 as the perturbative contribution is of O(\u03b1s) and small. For the extraction of the\nGegenbauer moments we thus have to rely on the optimum values of M2, 1 to 2GeV2,\nand s0 determined from the sum rules for the decay constants.\n3.5 Models for Distribution Amplitudes\nNearly all models for DAs rely on a truncated conformal expansion, which is not too\nsurprising in view of the fact that it is only moments (or Gegenbauer moments) that are\n12\n0.05\n0.1\n0.15\n0.2\n0.25\n0.3\n0.35\n0.4\n0.45\n0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2\na 2\n(1G\neV\n)\n2M  [GeV]2\nFigure 7: a2(1GeV) as function of the Borel parameter M\n2.

Truncation after the first few moments implies\nthat only gross features of the DAs are taken into account, which is sufficient if physical\namplitudes are obtained by convoluting with a smooth perturbative scattering amplitude\n\u2013 or if the characteristic scale of the process is large enough for the logarithmic damping\nof high-order Gegenbauer moments to have become effective. In this paper we assume\nthat this is indeed the case and that a truncation after n = 2 yields a meaningful approx-\nimation. We then obtain the following model for the three leading-twist DAs of strange\nmesons containing an s quark:\n\u03c6K(u, \u00b5) = 6u(1\u2212 u)\n[\n1 + 3a1(\u00b5)(2u\u2212 1) + a2(\u00b5) 3\n2\n(5(2u\u2212 1)2 \u2212 1)\n]\n. (3.10)\nTo obtain the DAs for mesons with an s antiquark, one has to replace u \u2194 1 \u2212 u. The\nvalues of the Gegenbauer moments a1 and a2 are calculated from QCD sum rules at the\nlow scale 1 GeV and scaled up to 2 and 4.8 GeV, to LO accuracy;1 numerical values are\ncollected in Tab. 2. Eq. (3.10) is ready for use in phenomenological applications.\n4 Summary and Conclusions\nWe have presented a comprehensive study of SU(3) breaking corrections to the decay\nconstants and the leading-twist light-cone distribution amplitudes of K and K\u2217 mesons\nfrom QCD sum rules. We have corrected a few computational mistakes in previous works\nand included radiative corrections to the leading contributions to odd moments of the\ndistribution amplitudes. Our main results are summarised in Eqs. (3.7), (3.10) and Tab. 2.\nWe find in particular that the first Gegenbauer moments are negative for all three DAs,\nin contrast to previous determinations. The decay constants fK and f\n\u2016\nK can be extracted\nfrom experiment with good accuracy, whereas f\u22a5K has to be determined theoretically.\nIts accuracy is limited mainly by the uncertainty of the input parameters, whereas the\naccuracy of the Gegenbauer moment a1 is in addition limited by the lack of a proper\nplateau region in the Borel parameter, which suggests that the uncertainty is dominated\n1NLO scaling mixes all Gegenbauer moments, so that to this accuracy the model (3.10) receives\nradiatively generated corrections in an>2.\n14\nby systematics. The latter limitation also affects a2. This implies that further refinement\nof the sum rules by calculating even higher order corrections is not likely to improve their\naccuracy. Any decisive improvement has to come from a different method, for which\nlattice QCD appears to be a natural candidate. It is to be hoped that the preliminary\nresults for the second moment of the twist-2 pion DA reported in [4] will be improved and\nalso extended to the K and other mesons.\nEq. (3.10) and Tab. 2 present an approximation to the full DA to NLO in the conformal\nexpansion. A question we have not touched upon in this paper is the suitability of this\napproximation for calculating physical amplitudes of type\nAphys \u223c\n\u222b 1\n0\ndu \u03c6(u)T (u),\nwhere T (u) is a perturbative scattering amplitude. Obviously the answer to this question\ndepends on the functional dependence of T on u. The standard argument to justify the\nvalidity of a truncated conformal expansion is that for sufficiently smooth functions T (u)\nhigher order Gegenbauer polynomials in \u03c6(u) with their highly oscillatory behaviour are\neffectively washed out. It is also argued that, for large scales, higher order Gegenbauer\nmoments are suppressed by renormalisation group scaling, so that for most applications\nthe asymptotic DA is sufficient. These arguments are usually presented in a qualitative\nrather than a quantitative way and it would be interesting to study, within a well-defined\nmodel that does not rely on conformal expansion, how sensitive physical amplitudes ac-\ntually are to a truncation of the conformal expansion, and at what scales logarithmic\ndamping becomes effective.
