But achieving \ngreater effectiveness, fundamental though that must be, is not enough. Decision \nmakers also beed to know whether those outcome gains are \u2018worth it\u2019: are they cost-\neffective? \n \nIn an effort to obtain the best value from decisions about service delivery, \npharmacological treatments and other interventions, there have been increasing calls \nfor economic analysis. The high cost of many mental health problems in childhood \nand adolescence has been evidenced in various studies around the world such as \nJulian et al, 1992 and Jackson 1996 . These studies emphasise the economic impact \nfor families, the health services and other agencies of the of morbidity of mental \nillness in children and adolescents. Although these studies provide important \ninformation about the description of services and costs of mental disorders in young, \nthey do not provide insight into which interventions are relatively the most efficient in \nproviding the best outcomes for given expenditures of resources.  Given the high \nlevels of demand for services, technology and treatments, and the high personal and \nsocial costs associated with mental health problems, evidence on the relative value of \ndifferent service interventions and treatments becomes necessary. By assembling, \nassessing and comparing the costs, health effects and quality of life improvements of \ninterventions, economic evaluation provides decision makers at all levels within a \ncare system with information to help them make best value judgements.  \n \nThe aim of this study was to review the economic evaluation literature in the child \nand adolescent mental health area. We systematically obtained and reviewed all \npublished cost-effectiveness analyses in this area and assessed their quality. \n \nMETHODS \n \nSearch strategy \n \nAn electronic search was conducted in June 2001 on Medline (1966 to 2001), \nPsychINFO (1967 to 1983, and 1984 to March 2001) and EMBASE (1980 to 2001). \nThese searches were updated in July 2002 on Medline (2001 to June week 2 2002), \nPsychINFO (2001 to May week 5 2002) and EMBASE (January 2001 to June week 2 \n2002). The details of the search strategy are available from the authors. \n \nInclusion criteria \n \nFor inclusion in the review, studies or papers needed to meet the following criteria: \n \n\u2022 focused primarily on children aged 18 or under; \n\u2022 focused on a diagnosable psychiatric problem or disorder, whether present or \nat risk; \n\u2022 focused on psychotherapies, pharmacotherapies, service arrangements or \npolicies; and  \n\u2022 Assessment of costs alongside outcomes or costs and savings. \n 2\n20 October 2003 \n \n \nExclusion criteria \n \nThe exclusion criteria follow from the above list, but we particularly sought to \nexclude: \n \n\u2022 studies of interventions aimed at parents of children with mental health \nproblems; \n\u2022 studies of adults diagnosed with mental illness who had childhood problems; \nand \n\u2022 studies of non-health care interventions (for example, school-based \ninterventions) unless one of the main objectives was to improve the mental \nhealth of particular subgroups of children (pupils). \n \nThree reviewers (RR, SB, and MK) screened abstracts of all papers identified by the \nsearch and judged the eligibility of articles from the abstract. Where there was \nuncertainty about inclusion of an article or there was no abstract on which to make a \njudgement, the full article was included for data extraction.  \n \nData extraction \n \nA data extraction sheet was designed to collect information on the following aspects \nof each study: type of intervention, type of mental health problem, type of economic \nevaluation, range of costs included, study perspective (e.g. societal, health service, \npublic sector or child and family), outcome measures, sample size, study design, \nstatistical analysis, sensitivity analysis and generalizability. Table1 summarises the \nbasic aspects of each of the studies identified as economic evaluations.  \n \nAssessment of quality \n \nTo assess the quality of the economic evaluations, we referred to the ten-point \nchecklist suggested by Drummond et al (1997), summarised in Box 1. Each paper was \nread by one author (the papers equally shared between the authors) and a summary \nand commentary drafted. A second author then read the paper and discussed changes \nto the structured account with the co-authors. \n \n(Box 1 inserted) \n \nRESULTS \n \nIn this section general remarks will be followed by more specific observations on the \nstudies grouped by diagnostic categroies. \n \nSearch results \n \nThe search identified a total of 1615 references, of which 56 studies appeared to meet \nour inclusion criteria and were extracted for review. On review of the full articles, a \nfurther 35 studies were subsequently found not to be eligible for inclusion and were \nexcluded. The 21 included studies were all published in English between 1980 to \n2002. Nine (43%) of the studies were from the US. Four (19%) were from the UK, \n 3\n20 October 2003 \n \nfour (19%) from Canada and the rest from Australia, Sweden, Norway and the \nNetherlands.   \n \nOf the 21 studies located, 14 included assessments of both costs and outcomes of two \nor more interventions. These studies differed in the way effectiveness was expressed, \nwhich made it difficult to compare across studies. Most were cost-effectiveness \nanalyses which compared costs and outcomes measured on disease-specific scales for \nsymptoms, behaviour, parent child interaction, parent\u2019s sense of competence and \nfunctioning. Cost-utility analysis, involving the measurement of costs and \nmeasurement of outcomes in terms of the summary indicator, quality-adjusted life \nyears, was only undertaken in one study. No cost-benefit analyses, measuring costs \nand outcomes in monetary terms, were located.  \n \nSeven studies, although variously referred to by the authors as cost-benefit, cost-\neffectiveness or cost-minimisation analyses, were in fact more appropriately classified \nas cost-offset studies. Cost-offset studies compare costs incurred with costs saved. \nThese studies ignore child-focused outcomes such as changes in clinical status or \nquality of life, and as a result cannot provide insight into the efficiency with which the \nresources are deployed, that is they do not assess cost-effectiveness. For this reason \nthey cannot be classified as economic evaluations. However, there is not always an \nunambiguous division between costs and outcomes, for savings that result from \nreduced service use are likely to result from reduced individual needs, which can \nobviously also be called outcomes. Moreover, some outcomes might be proxied by \nchanges in service use \u2013 a good example being reduced antisocial behaviour measured \nby a reduction in crime. It is only a small step from there to measurement in cost \nterms of reductions in the criminal justice and societal implications of crime. \n \nTable 1 summarises the basic characteristics of all the studies included in terms of the \ntype of economic evaluation, the problem under study, the intervention(s) examined, \nthe costs and outcomes measured and the main findings. Where the type of economic \nevaluation stated in the papers is disputed, our own classification is reported.  \n \nDiagnostic Categories \n \nBehavioural disorders \nEight of the fourteen economic evaluations focused on behavioural disorders or \nantisocial behvaviour. One evaluated a drug treatment for hyperactive children \n(Gilmore & Milne, 2001), while three others examined alternative behavioural \ntechniques (Christensen et al, 1980; Jones & Offord, 1989; Thompson et al, 1996). \nFour studies evaluated the location of services (Cunningham et al, 1995; Grizenko & \nPapineau, 1992; Harrington et al, 2000; Slot et al, 1992). \n \nIn the study looking at pharmacotherapies as a treatment for hyperactivity in children, \nGilmore and Milne (2001) estimated the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). \nOf the papers that meet our inclusion criteria, this is the paper included in the review \nwhich combines costs with quality of life in a cost-utility analysis. The cost per \nQALY derived by the authors (\u00a37,446-\u00a39,177) depending on the severity of the \ndisorder) was stated to compare favourably with other treatments currently available. \nHowever the methodology used has been debated (Freemantle & Mason, 1999; \nCampbell et al, 1999).  \n 4\n20 October 2003 \n \n \nThree studies evaluated alternative behavioural therapeutic interventions (Christensen \net al, 1980; Jones & Offord, 1989; Thompson et al, 1996). Both Christensen and \nThompson measured costs narrowly in terms of professsionals\u2019 time. A range of \noutcome measures was used, including parent perception of problem behaviour, \noverall satisfaction with family relationships (Thompson et al 1996), reduction in \nproblem behaviours (Christensen et al 1980), skill development, integration, self-\nesteem and behaviour at home and school, and community measures of antisocial \nbehaviour (police charges, secuirty violations, fire calls) (Jones & Offord, 1989). \n \nThe findings of the Christensen study of behavioural family therapy indicate that, \ncompared to controls, the parents who completed the therapeutic training programmes \nreported improvements in their child\u2019s externalising behaviour, more satisfaction and \nefficacy for parents and more satisfaction in family relationships in general. At \ntreatment termination, the authors indicate that those receiving minimal contact \nbibliotherapy spent less time (5 hours) with the professional than those in individual \ntreatment (11 hours). There were also significantly larger reductions in problem \nbehaviours under clinical conditions. Although limited in its narrow range of costs \nand small sample size, the study provides valuable information in an under researched \narea.  \n \nThompson et al (1996) found that parent training for those who completed the \nprogramme resulted in greater satisfaction in family relationships than controls. The \nadditional direct cost per family was estimated at $70 (\u00a344). The authors admit that \nthe results are limited due to non-random allocation to treatment, the narrow \nconceptualisation of costs, lack of a clear perspective and lack of discussion of the \neconomic issues associated with use of one treatment over another. \n \nThe focus of the Jones & Offord (1989) study was non-school skill development to all \nchildren aged 5-15 living in a publicly-supported housing complex. Experimental and \ncontrol housing complexes were compared over three years. Data on costs and \npotential savings were measured. Significant improvements were found in antisocial \nbehaviour outside home and school, but there were no spillover effects on school \nperformance or behaviour at home. Costs were only measured for the intervention \nprogramme. A cost-offset analysis found that programme expenditure was \nsubstantially smaller than savings. \n \nTwo other Canadian studies evaluated the location of services for young people with \nbehavioural disorders (Grizenko & Papineau, 1992; Cunningham et al, 1995). \nGrizenko & Papineau (1992) compared the costs and effects of a residential unit in a \npsychiatric hospital with a day treatment programme. The findings indicate that each \ntreatment group showed a significant improvement in the level of school integration. \nCosts of the day treatment group were significantly less than for the residential group. \nThe authors point out a number of methodological weaknesses of the study associated \nwith the overall design and costing methods.  \n \nCunningham and colleagues (1995) assessed the cost-effectiveness of a large \ncommunity-based group training programme compared to a clinic-based individual \nintervention.  Outcome measures included adherence, behaviour problems at home \nand the child\u2019s behaviour.  Cost measures were based on the programme costs, which \n 5\n20 October 2003 \n \nincluded the direct cost of the programme and use of educational and health care \nresources.  Between pre- and post-test, community groups tended to report greater \nadditional gains than individual participants.  The total cost per participant was \nmarginally lower for the individual programme compared to the community group.  A \nreview by the Cochrane Database argued that the conclusions of the authors appear \njustified given the data, although generalisibility of the results to other settings have \nnot been discussed.  \n \nIn the Netherlands, Slot et al (1992) compared a residential-based teaching family \nmodel of care to a traditional state institute for antisocial behaviour. Fifty-seven \nyoung people from the state institute were matched by age with young people treated \nby the teaching family model. No differences were found between the two groups in \nterms of problems or ability to form relationships outside the family, but young \npeople in the state institute showed improvement in community participation ability, \nwhilst those in the teaching family model showed no change. The teaching family \nmodel was much less costly than the state institute. This very simple study was \nhindered by a narrow cost perspective, small sample, limited matching and limited \nstatistical analyses. \n \nIn the UK, Harrington et al (2000) compared community-based with hospital-based \nparent education groups for children with behavioural disorders in a randomised \ncontrolled trial. Their findings suggest no differences in either outcomes or costs \nbetween the two groups.  The authors also suggest that the sample size, determined on \nthe basis of outcomes, may have been too small to detect a statistically significant \ndifference in cost. \n \nThe only cost offset study in this diagnostic group was conducted by Bagley and \nPritchard (1998), where the \u201cimpact\u201d measure assessed included cost savings as a \nresult of reductions in school exclusions. The results suggest that the reduction in \nschool exclusions produced a net benefit of \u00a3273,550 as a result of the social work \nintervention.  \n \nDepressive disorders \nTwo of the fourteen economic evaluations focused on the evaluation of interventions \nfor treating children with depressive illnesses. One involved an assessment of \nelectroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in treatment-resistant bipolar adolescents in Canada \n(Kutcher & Robertson, 1995) and the other a home-based social work intervention for \nchildren who deliberately poison themselves in the UK (Byford et al, 1999). Disease-\nspecific outcome measures were used and included the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale \n(BPRS), length of stay in hospital (Kutcher & Robertson, 1995), the Suicidal Ideation \nQuestionnaire (SIQ), the Hopelessness Scale and the Family Assessment Device \n(FAD), a measure of family functioning (Byford et al, 1999). Both these studies can \nbe described as cost-consequences analyses, since a range of outcome measures are \npresented alongside the costs. The authors investigated broad (Byford et al, 1999) and \nnarrow (Kutcher & Robertson, 1995) ranges of cost measures.  Measures of costs \nincluded general and specific health care costs such as inpatient care, education and \nsocial services.  \n \nByford et al (1999) report no significant differences between the two groups on any of \nthe outcome measures used or in the total costs per patient, although the observed \n 6\n20 October 2003 \n \ncosts appear to be lower in the social work group than the control group. Although \nthis paper has a large sample size (172) in comparision to other studies in the review, \nthe authors still recommend caution in interpretation given that sample size \ncalculations were based on outcomes and not cost.  Kutcher & Robertson (1995) \nreport significant improvement in BPRS scores and lower total costs per patient for \nthose in ECT compared to those who refused treatment, although this study is limited \nby non-randomised allocation and extremely small sample sizes (22 in total). \nEconomic evaluations undertaken in depressive illnesses extracted for review are not \nconclusive in favour of or against the cost-effectiveness of the experimental \ninterventions.  \n \nPsychosis \nTwo non-UK studies evaluated interventions for psychosis.  Mihalopoulous et al \n(1999) evaluated a community-oriented treatment for early onset psychosis in \nAustralia, and Rund et al (1994) from Norway evaluated a psychoeducational \nintervention compared to standard care for early onset schizophrenia. Both studies \nwere before-and-after studies undertaken using retrospective reviews, one looking at \n102 (Mihalopoulous et al, 1999) and the other at 24 young people (Rund et al, 1994).   \n \nOutcomes were measured using psychosocial functioning, relapse rates (Rund et al, \n1994), quality of life and negative symptoms (Mihalopoulous et al, 1999). Costs were \nanalysed from the perspective of the health service and included inpatient treatment, \nhome visits, consultations with a private medical doctor and seminar costs for parents, \nincluding travel and other expenses. Both studies found lower costs for the \nexperimental groups than the control groups, although there were no indications of the \nstatistical significance of these differences in the papers. For the community-\norientated treatment study, outcomes were found to be better in the experimental \ngroup. However, for the psychoeducational intervention there were no significant \ndifferences between the groups on length of hospital stay and relapse rates. The \nauthors conclude that the experimental interventions are cost-effective with lower \ncosts and better outcomes. In common with other studies in the review these studies \nsuffer from retrospective designs and small sample sizes. \n \nDevelopmental disorders \nOur review identified one study of the cost-effectiveness of early intervention services \nfor children with developmental disorders (Erickson Warfield, 1995). The author, in a \nfollow-up paper to an analysis of twenty-five publicly-supported services, suggests \nthat the service identified as more cost-effective varied by sub-group and outcome \nmeasure. The analyses suggest that group services are more efficient than home visits, \nalthough the generalisability of the results is limited. \n \nJacobson et al (1998) undertook an analysis of an early intensive behavioural \nprogramame for children with pervasive developmental disorder or autism. Althoigh \nthe title suggests a cost-benefit analysis, the study in fact compares the cost of the \nintervention in childhood with expenditure savings in adulthood. This paper has been \ncriticised for its narrowly \u2018economist\u2019 approach.  \n \nCo-morbid substance use \nKing et al (2000) examined the costs and outcomes of adolescents with substance use \ndisorders co-morbid with other psychiatric disorders in two different service systems \n 7\n20 October 2003 \n \n\u2013 the Fort Bragg Demonstration project, involving a continuum of care services, and \ntwo comparison sites that provided traditional fee-for-service mental health services. \nOutcomes were assessed at baseline and six months later and included substance use, \nimpairment level specifically attributed to substance abuse, mental and physical \nimpairment, caregiver strain and global functioning. Costs included all mental health \nservices provided. Total costs were almost US$40,000 (\u00a324,873) per participant for \nthe Fort Bragg Demonstration site and just over US$18,000 (\u00a311,193) for the \ncomparison sites. Outcomes were not found to be influenced by service system. The \nauthors do not come to any specific conclusion regarding relative cost-effectiveness, \nbut it appears that the demonstration site may be less cost-effective than the control \nsites. Any conclusion, however, must be viewed cautiously given small sample sizes \nand the possibility of bias due to the lack of randomisation or adjustment for \ndifferences between the two groups. \n \nVarious mental health problems \nInterventions geared towards a combination of mental health problems among youth, \nincluding children at risk of self-harm have used cost-offset as a means of assessing \ncosts in relation to savings from reductions in the utilisation of menal health services \n(Foster and Bickman, 2000), reductions in direct service hours delivered (Yates and \ncolleagues, 1994), averted hospitalisation costs (Margolis and Petti, 1994; Gustafsson \nand Svendin, 1998; Blumberg and colleagues, 2002) and reduction in direct service \nhours delivered ( Yates and colleagues, 1994).  \n \nDISCUSSION \n \nAs the availability of health-related interventions and technologies increases and \nsociety\u2019s resources remain finite, questions of efficiency tend to be posed with \nincreasing regularity in decision-making contexts. This is often the prompt for \neconomic evaluations.  A previous review conducted in 1997 suggests few economic \nevaluations of poor quality. As this review has demonstrated the situation has not \nimproved markedly. Only 14 full economic evaluations were found suggesting the \nnumber undertaken remains small.  \n \nWe found a number of descriptive cost studies that provide useful background and \nother data but cannot be seen as evaluative in that they do not measure outcomes. For \nexample, Beitchman et al (1992) investigate the factors impinging on costs and argue \nthat the disorders which consume the most resources should be the focus of early \nintervention.  However, because this form of analysis ignores outcomes, and \nspecifically the relative marginal benefits of alternative ways of spending the same \nfixed resources, it ought not to be seen as the (sole) basis for allocation decisions. A \nhigh cost disorder or behavioural problem may well - rightly - attract a lot of attention \nand generate much concern, but high cost alone cannot provide a basis for resource \nallocation. \n \nThe review also identified a number of cost-offset studies. These studies provide \nestimates of savings to health and non-health sectors as a result a mental health \ninterventions. Though the measures of costs and outcomes (where they were \nmeasured) differ across studies, all of the studies indicated some level of savings as a \nresult of the intervention. However, because each study is context - and country - \n 8\n20 October 2003 \n \nspecific it is difficult to know how far it is possible to generalise the findings: the \nresults are indicative. \n \nEconomic evaluations conducted in this field have focused on service-based \ninterventions and their location as opposed to interventions directed to managing the \nillness. There has only been one study to date which has evaluated the cost-\neffectiveness of a drug treatment for children with mental health problems (Gilmore \n& Milne, 2001). This is no doubt due in part to the small market for drug treatment \nfor children compared to adults (Knapp, 1997). There have been more - but still \ndisappointingly few - economic evaluations of behavioural therapies for children and \nadolescents, particularly for behavioural disorders. \n \nWhat also becomes apparent from this review are the methodological limitations \ncommon to most of the economic evaluations which could lead to invalid and biased \ndecisions. Problems include small sample sizes that limit the power to detect \nsignificant differences, decision analysis or other models based on spurious, dubious \nor untested assumptions, and limited statistical and econometric methods (recent \nadvances in statistical methods applied to economic evaluations has made less recent \nstudies appear to lack robustness). Evaluations were mainly undertaken from just the \nprovider perspective, resulting in a narrow conceptualisation of costs that may fail to \nuncover all important society-wide impacts of an intervention. \n \nCost-effectiveness analysis, employing disease-specific measures of outcome, was the \nmost widely used method of economic evaluation in the area of child and adolescent \nmental health. This is not surprising given the wide range of outcome measures to be \nanalysed in mental health and the comparative ease with which economic evaluations \ncan be attached to a clinical study. There has been little use of incremental cost-\neffectiveness ratios in the CAMHS field, even though this has been standard health \neconomics practice in many other clinical fields for some time. Nor has there been \nmuch exploration of QALYs, within cost-utility analyses. This is perhaps due to \nconceptual and methodological difficulies in translating measures of outcome into \ngeneric health-related quality of life measures.  More generally, too few clinical \nanalyses have been conducted to the exclusion of economic aspects. \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nGeneral awareness of the need to focus health and social care decision-making on \ncost-effectiveness analyses, has prompted calls for economic evaluations of \ncompeting interventions in a number of areas.  The area of child and adolescent \nmental health is no exception. There is, without doubt, heightened awareness among \npolicy makers of the need for evidence-based information to guide policy and practice \nfor children and adolescents with mental health problems. But there is also a widely \nrecognised paucity of solid evidence. In this paper, we have reported the results of our \nsearch for economic evaluative data - the kinds of findings that could and should \ninform resource allocation decisions. What we have found has been disappointing but \nperhaps not surprising. Given the varied nature of mental health problems and mental \nhealth interventions, and the small number of economic evaluations undertaken it is \ndifficult to come to any firm policy conclusions.  \n \n 9\n20 October 2003 \n \nOur systematic review found that most of the economic studies focused on \nbehavioural disorders or antisocial behaviour which are highlighted as clinical and \nsocial problems across many countries. Within this diagnostic group most of the \nstudies compared the location of service provision, although location, forms of the \nintervention and methodologies used differed significantly across studies. \nInterventions for depressive disorders, psychosis, developmental disorders and co-\nmorbid substance use were all examined using cost-effectiveness analysis, but again \nthere were few such studies. \n \nOn the brighter side, the situation has improved since a somewhat less systematic \nreview conducted a few years ago (Knapp, 1997). Over the last five or six years, there \nhas been more awareness of the need for this evaluative perspective, and more \ndiscussion about the methodological needs for good research. More sophisticated and \nrobust techniques are being employed.  At our own centre - Centre for the Economics \nof Mental Health, at the Institute of Psychiatry staff are undertaking research in a \nwide spectrum of childhood mental health disorders. An economic evaluation of \ngroup versus individual psychotherapy for sexually abused girls has recently been \ncompleted. An investigation of the service use and costs for adults who were treated \nfor childhood depression is underway. An assessment of the cost-effectiveness and \ncost-utility of fluoxetine and cognitive-behaviour therapy versus fluoxetine alone in \nadolescents with persistent major depression is also being undertaken. Other studies \ninclude an evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of specialist inpatient treatment, \nspecialist outpatient treatment and general management in child and adolescent \nmental health services for adolescents with anorexia nervosa and a quantitative survey \nand qualitative case study analysis to determine the effectiveness of mental health \nprovision for young people in custody and in the community. We are also aware of \nresearch in the US and other countries that will contribute importantly to solid \neconomics evidence base for child and adolescent mental health policy and practice. \n \n 10\n20 October 2003 \n \nREFERENCES  \n \nBagley, C., Pritchard, C.

Was a well-defined question posed in answerable form? \n \nDid the study examine both the costs and effects of the service(s) or programme(s)? \nDid the study involve a comparison of alternatives? \nWas a viewpoint for the analysis stated and was the study placed in any particular \ndecision-making context? \n \n2. Was a comprehensive description of the competing alternatives given (i.e., \ncan you tell who did what to whom, where, and how often)? \n \nWere any important alternatives omitted? \nWas (Should) a do-nothing alternative (be) considered? \n \n3. Was the effectiveness of the programme or service established? \n \nWas this done through randomised, controlled clinical trial? If so, did the trial \nprotocol reflect what would happen in regular practice? \nWas effectiveness established through an overview of clinical studies? \nWere observational data or assumptions used to establish effectiveness? If so, what \nare the potential biases in results? \n \n4. Were all important and relevant costs and consequences for each alternative \nidentified? \n \nWas the range wide enough for the research question at hand? \nDid the costs cover all relevant viewpoints?  (Possible viewpoints include the \ncommunity or social viewpoint, and those of patients and third party payers. Other \nviewpoints may also be relevant depending upon the particular analysis.) \nWere capital cost, as well as operating cost, included? \n \n5. Were costs and consequences measured accurately in appropriate physical \nunits? (e.g. hours of nursing time, number of physician visits, lost work-days, \ngained life-years) \n \nWere any of the identified items omitted from measurement?  If so, does this mean \nthat they carry no weight in the subsequent analysis? \nWere there any special circumstances (e.g., joint use of resources) that made \nmeasurement difficult? Were these circumstances handled appropriately? \n \n6. Were cost and consequences valued credibly?   \n \nWere the sources of all values clearly identified?  (Possible sources include market \nvalues, patient or client preferences and views, policy-makers\u2019 views and health \nprofessionals\u2019 judgements.) \n \nWere market values employed for changes involving resources gained or depleted? \n 18\n05 July 2005 \nWhere market values were absent (e.g., volunteer labour), or market values do not \nreflect actual values (such as clinic space donated at a reduced rate), were adjustments \nmade to approximate market values?. \nWas the valuation of consequences appropriate for the question posed (i.e. has the \nappropriate type or types of analysis \u2013 cost-effectiveness, cost-benefit, cost-utility \u2013 \nbeen selected)? \n \n7. Were costs and consequences adjusted for differential timing?    \n \nWere costs and consequences which occur in the future \u2018discounted\u2019 to their present \nvalues? \nWas any justification given for the discount rate used? \n \n8. Was an incremental analysis of costs and consequences of alternatives \nperformed? \n \nWere the additional  (incremental) costs generated by one alternative  over another \ncompared to the additional effects, benefits or utilities generated? \n \n9. Was a sensitivity analysis performed? \n \nIf data on costs and consequences were stochastic, were appropriate statistical \nanalyses performed? \nIf a sensitivity analysis was employed, was a justification provided for the ranges of \nvalues (for key study parameters)? \nWere the study results sensitive to changes in the values (within the assumed range \nfor sensitivity analysis, or within the confidence interval around the ratio of costs to \nconsequences)? \n \n10. Did the presentation and discussion of study results include all issues of \nconcern to users? \n \nWere the conclusions of the analysis based on some overall index or ratio of costs to \nconsequences (e.g., cost-effectiveness ratio)? If so, was the index interpreted \nintelligently or in a mechanistic fashion? \nWere the results compared with those of others who have investigated the same \nquestion? If so, were allowances made for potential differences in study \nmethodology? \nDid the study discuss the generaliseability of the results to other settings and \npatient\/client groups? \nDid the study allude to, or take account of, other important factors in the choice or \ndecision under consideration (e.g., distribution of costs and consequences, or relevant \nethical issues)? \nDid the study discuss issues of implementation, such as the feasibility of adopting the \n\u2018preferred\u2019 programme given existing financial or other constraints, and whether any \nfreed resources could be redeployed to other worthwhile programmes? \n \nSource: Drummond et al (1997) \n 19\n05 July 2005 \nSummary criteria for assessing quality of cost effectiveness studies ( possible \nalternative to Box1) \n \n\u2022 Inclusion of focused study question  \n\u2022 Inclusion of statement on viewpoint of analysis \n\u2022 Was there a clear description of of comparators? \n\u2022 Effectiveness of interventions established \n\u2022 Were all relevant cost and outcomes identified for each alternative \n\u2022 Were these cost and outcomes measured and valued plausibly \n\u2022 Were cost and outcomes discounted? \n\u2022 Inclusion of sensitivity analysis \n\u2022 Incremental approach to analysis of costs and effects used \n\u2022 How appropriate is the analysis to users? \n \n 20\n"}
