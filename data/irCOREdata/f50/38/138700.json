Although having unique aerodynamic\nperformance advantages [1], the BWB aircraft suffers\nfrom stability and control problems due to the absence\nof a horizontal stabilizer. An effort is being made\nto augment these stability issues by use of an inte-\ngrated propulsion\/flight control concept. Integrated\npropulsion can be used for active flow control over\nthe main lifting surface as well as trailing edge flaps.\nThe blended wing configuration in particular has large\nroot chords which causes thickening of the boundary\nlayer and flow separation, especially at high angles of\nattack. Bleed air from the engine can be used here\n\u2217Corresponding author: Dynamics Simulations and Controls\nGroup, Cranfield University, Building 83, Bedfordshire MK43 OAL,\nUK. email: n.ur-rahman@cranfield.ac.uk\nto re-energize the boundary layer thus delaying or\nminimizing flow separation [2].\nIn a propulsion controlled aircraft, the power plant is\ndirectly involved in the generation or modification of\ncontrol forces and lift. Englar [3] conducted a series\nof experiments on jet flaps and circulation control\ntrailing\/leading edge devices for lift enhancement. It\nwas reported that with circulation control, lift coef-\nficients comparable to or better than most complex\nmechanical flap systems can be achieved [3].\nVariable engine bleed can however adversely affect\nengine performance. It not only degrades engine effi-\nciency but also alters its dynamics. The two control\ninputs that are generally used to change the state of the\nengine are fuel flow and nozzle area. If engine bleed is\na variable, it starts affecting the steady state and tran-\nsient operation of the engine and may render the flow\nor circulation control concept infeasible.\nThis paper presents the work on modelling of engine\ndynamics and its overall performance under vari-\nable bleed conditions. The approach followed is to\nmodel various engine subsystems using performance\nmaps and then interlink each individual component\nto get an overall engine performance model. Two\nJAERO389 \u00a9 IMechE 2008 Proc. IMechE Vol. 222 Part G: J. Aerospace Engineering\n940 NURahman and J FWhidborne\napproaches were considered: the inter-component\nvolume method [4] and the constraint satisfaction\niterative method [5]. However, the inter-component\nvolume method was eventually selected due to its\nreal time performance and simplicity. Both open\nloop (fuel flow demand defined by user) and closed\nloop (fuel flow demand set by engine speed control)\nresponses were simulated. The advanced micro tur-\nbine (AMT) Olympus single-spool turbojet engine [6]\nwas selected as a test case. The simulation results\nwere validated with data from bleed experiments con-\nducted on the AMT Olympus engine at the University\nof Manchester [7].\n2 THE ENGINEMODEL\nIn order to simulate a dynamic system, it is important\nto specify a set of minimum number of variables or\nstates (X ) that completely define the system dynamics.\nAn input vector (u) establishes a means of controlling\nor changing the state of the system. For a single-spool\nturbojet system, as shown in Fig. 1, the compressor and\nturbine exit pressures [P3, P5] are important system\nstates. If component efficiencies and exit pressures\nare known, temperatures at various engine stages of\nthe engine can be calculated using thermodynamic\nrelationships. Shaft rotational speed (N ) is another\nimportant parameter that forms part of the state vec-\ntor. The fuel flowrate (wf ) and nozzle area (An) were\nused to control the state of the system. Thus the state\nand control vectors are defined as follows\nX = (P3,P5,N ) and u = (wf ,An)\n2.1 Intakemodel\nIn this work, a static intake model was incorporated\nand the flow process was assumed to be adiabatic.\nWith the free stream static pressure and temperature\nas (p0, t0) and Mach number (M ), the total conditions\n(T1,P1) at the intake face can be calculated from\nreference [8]\nT1\nt0\n= 1 + \u03b3 \u2212 1\n2\nM 2 (1)\nP1\np0\n=\n(\nT1\nt0\n)\u03b3 \/(\u03b3\u22121)\n(2)\nThe total temperature (T1) represents the rise in tem-\nperature by bringing air molecules travelling at Mach\nnumber (M ) to rest at the intake face. The total pres-\nsure at the intake face is a function of temperature ratio\nand is given by equation (2). Since no energy is added\nin the intake, the total temperature remains constant\n[9]. However, there is a loss in total pressure as the flow\npasses through the intake and this pressure loss is a\nmeasure of intake efficiency (\u03b7I). Therefore, the intake\nexit conditions are\nT2 = T1 (3)\nP2 = \u03b7I(P1) (4)\nFor the AMT Olympus, the intake efficiency is assumed\nto be 1.0.\n2.2 The AMTOlympus compressormodel\nRepresentative AMT Olympus engine compressor\nmaps from reference [10] are shown in Fig. 2. These\nmaps are a function of non-dimensional compressor\nspeed (N \u2217c = N\/\n\u221a\nT2\/Tstd) and the non-dimensional\/\ncorrected mass flow (w\u2217c = wc\n\u221a\nT2\/Tstd\/P2\/Pstd). Using\nthese definitions, the compressor pressure ratio and\ncorrected speed (P3\/P2,N \u2217c ) were calculated using the\ncompressor inlet conditions (T2,P2) and knowledge of\nthe state vector, X = (P3,P5,N ). A two-dimensional\ninterpolation routine was used to get the corrected\nmass flow and efficiency (w\u2217c , \u03b7c) from the compressor\nmaps. From reference [8], the compressor temperature\nFig. 1 Single-spool turbojet dynamic model with inter-component volumes\nProc. IMechE Vol. 222 Part G: J.

The amount of energy imparted to\nthe pressurized air depends upon the fuel to air ratio\nand the heating value (HV) of the fuel. Not all the fuel\nis burnt and a burner efficiency (\u03b7b) is associated with\nthe fuel burning process. A typical value for burning\nefficiency is 0.98. Reference [11] gives an expression\nfor combustor temperature rise\n\u0004T34 = \u03b7b\n(\nwf\nw3\n)\nHVfuel\ncp\n(9)\nThe combustor exit temperature is therefore\nT4 = T3 + \u0004T34 (10)\nand the net mass flow from combustor\nw4 = w3 + wf (11)\nIf the pressure loss (\u0004Ploss) in the combustor is\nexpressed as a fraction of the combustor entry pres-\nsure, the combustor exit pressure will be\nP4 = P3(1 \u2212 \u0004Ploss) (12)\nThis establishes the combustor exit conditions\n(w4,T4,P4).\n2.4 The AMTOlympus turbinemodel\nSimilar to the compressor, the turbine model for\nthe AMT Olympus was also based on performance\nmaps. The first map relates non-dimensional tur-\nbine mass flow (w\u2217t = wt\n\u221a\nT4\/P4) with turbine pressure\nratio and the second map gives a measure of tur-\nbine efficiency. Representative turbine maps for the\nAMT Olympus turbojet engine from reference [10] are\nshown in Fig. 3. The speed line corresponding to low-\nest non-dimensional turbine speed (N \u2217t = N\/\n\u221a\nT4) is\nhighlighted.\nUsing the state vector X = (P3,P5,N ) and two-\ndimensional interpolation, the non-dimensional tur-\nbine mass flow and turbine efficiency (w\u2217t , \u03b7t) are\ncalculated from the turbine maps.

The turbine exit conditions (w5,T5,P5)\nare now established.\n2.5 The AMTOlympus convergent nozzle\nThe ambient pressure outside the nozzle is taken as p0,\nand the nozzle pressure ratio is hence\n(Pr)noz = P5p0 (16)\nThe pressure ratio for which the nozzle exit speed\nreaches the speed of sound is called the critical pres-\nsure ratio and is a sole function of ratio of specific heat\n[12]\n(Pr)crit =\n(\n2\n1 + \u03b3\n)\u03b3 \/(1\u2212\u03b3 )\n(17)\nIf the nozzle pressure ratio (Pr)noz is greater than (Pr)crit,\nthe nozzle will choke and the nozzle pressure ratio will\nbe limited to (Pr)crit. For a convergent nozzle with exit\narea (An), the mass flow through the nozzle is given by\nthe following expression from reference [12]\nwn = AnP5R (Pr)\n\u22121\/\u03b3\n\u221a\n2gcp\nT5\n(1 \u2212 P\u2212R\/cpr ) (18)\nwhere Pr is the limited value of nozzle pressure ratio\nwhich is less than or equal to the critical pressure ratio\n(Pr)crit. The nozzle jet velocity is a function of nozzle\npressure ratio and total nozzle temperature\nVjet =\n\u221a\n2gcpT5(1 \u2212 P\u2212R\/cpr ) (19)\nThe net thrust is a sum of momentum and pressure\ncomponents\nF = wn(Vjet \u2212 V0) + An(P6 \u2212 p0) (20)\nwhere V0 is the aircraft speed and P6 is the pressure at\nthe face of nozzle exit.\n2.6 Evaluation of pressure derivatives: P\u02d93, P\u02d95\nFigure 4 shows two control volumes for the AMT Olym-\npus single-spool turbojet. The first control volume is\nassociated between the compressor and combustor.\nThe mass storage in this volume is used to calcu-\nlate rate of change of compressor exit pressure (P\u02d93).\nThe second control volume is between the turbine\nand nozzle and shall provide derivative of turbine\nexit pressure (P\u02d95). For the volume associated with the\ncombustor chamber and the compressor, the rate of\naccumulation of mass is\nm\u02d93 = w3 + wf \u2212 wt (21)\nand similarly for the volume between the turbine and\nthe nozzle, the rate of change of mass is\nm\u02d95 = wt \u2212 wn (22)\nProc.

The control\nscheme is shown in Fig. 6. The controller uses a pro-\nportional + integral architecture, with the maximum\nfuel limit set by either the maximum allowable fuel\nflow or the turbine entry temperature (TET), T4.

The slew\nrate limit was set to \u00b110 per cent of the maximum\nengine speed. Gain values for the proportional and\nintegral were set at Kp = 0.05 and Ki = 0.0075, respec-\ntively. The initial integral state (x0) in the engine speed\ncontroller was set to 50 per cent of maximum fuel\nflowrate.\n3 AMTOLYMPUSTURBOJET ENGINE\nThe simulation method described previously was vali-\ndated on the AMT Olympus [6] turbojet engine (Fig. 7).\nIt is a small engine that generates up to 190 N of thrust.\nThe engine has a single-stage centrifugal compressor\nand single-stage axial turbine. The combustor cham-\nber is of annular type. An electronic engine control unit\n(ECU) controls the revolutions per minute and lim-\nits the maximum exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The\nbasic engine specifications as derived from reference\n[6] are shown in Table 1.\nBesides the component map data, certain other\nengine parameters were required to complete the\nTable 1 Technical data AMT Olympus\nEngine parameter Value\nDiameter (mm) 130\nLength (mm) 270\nMaximum thrust (N) 190\nPressure ratio 4:1\nMass flow (kg\/s) 0.4\nMaximum rotational speed (r\/min) 112 500\nNominal EGT (K) 923\nMaximum EGT (K) 973\nMaximum fuel consumption (kg\/min) 0.4\nengine model. These were adjusted to match the\nexperimental results. A combustion burner efficiency\nof 0.88 was used, together with combustion chamber\npressure loss of 5 per cent. The intake and mechan-\nical transmission efficiencies were set at 1.0 and\n0.92, respectively. A rotor inertia of 0.0004 kg m2 was\nassumed. An exact value of rotor inertia was not avail-\nable, so this was adjusted by observing the time to\nreach maximum revolutions per minute. An effective\nnozzle area which is 95 per cent of the geometrical\nnozzle area was used to cater for the effect of boundary\nlayer growth in the nozzle. Two control volumes were\nneeded to calculate the pressure derivatives; these\nwere selected as 1.0 and 0.75 ft3 for the volumes associ-\nated with compressor\/combustor and turbine\/nozzle,\nrespectively. The initial state vector was set at\nX 0 = [P3,P5,N ] = [2.2P2, 1.5P2, 88 000] (25)\nwhich places the engine operating point at a reason-\nable location on the compressor and turbine maps.\nFig. 7 AMT Olympus single-spool turbojet engine [10]\nProc.

Aerospace Engineering JAERO389 \u00a9 IMechE 2008\nNumerical investigation of engine bleed 945\n4 SIMULATIONDESCRIPTION\nThe engine simulation can be divided into two parts:\npretransient phase and the transient\n4.1 Pretransient\nKeeping a fixed value of fuel inflow, the simulation runs\ntill it reaches a state when X\u02d9 = 0 and there is no accu-\nmulation of mass in any control volume. This phase\nis called the pretransient and with the control vec-\ntor u = [wf ,An] fixed, the simulation converges to a\nsteady-state condition. The pretransient phase can be\navoided by using the last known converged or steady-\nstate values of X 0 and control input (u0), respectively.\nIn Fig. 8, the line from point A to B shows the path fol-\nlowed by the engine as it settles down to a steady-state\ncondition in the pretransient phase. Point A represents\nthe initial condition, X 0, on the compressor map as\nspecified at start of the simulation and point B corre-\nsponds to a steady-state condition reached, according\nto the fuel setting specified in u0.\n4.2 Transient\nOnce the engine has reached a steady-state condition\nat point B, the control vectoru = [wf , An] consisting of\nfuel flowrate and nozzle area can be varied to initiate\na transient. During a transient, it takes a finite amount\nof time for the rotor to spool up or down but the mass\nflow and therefore pressure changes inside the engine\ncan be quite rapid. The effect of a sudden increase in\nfuel flow is to move the compressor operating point up\nalong the speed line towards surge. A sudden reduc-\ntion in fuel flow causes the reverse action and the\ncompressor operating point moves down towards the\nchoking point. Path B to C in Fig. 8, shows the tran-\nsient response of the AMT Olympus engine to a slew\nrate limited engine speed demand. The transient was\nrun with engine speed control engaged. The engine\nsettles down at point C corresponding to maximum\nspeed demand of 112 500 r\/min.\n5 SIMULATION RESULTS ANDVALIDATION\n5.1 Steady-state results\nThe steady-state experimental values under zero com-\npressor bleed were compared at maximum speed with\nengine speed control engaged. Values of fuel flow,\nthrust, compressor pressure ratio, and mass flow were\nnoted. Table 2, summarizes the steady-state results at\nmaximum engine speed.\nIt is evident that there is a good match between the\nexperimental and the simulated values. The percent-\nage errors are less than 3 per cent for most of the\nparameters except the EGT error, which is approxi-\nmately 6 per cent.The simulation predicts lesser values\nof EGT at maximum engine speed. However, as will be\ndiscussed later, at lower engine speed values, the EGT\ncorrelation was much better.\nTable 2 AMT Olympus engine steady state comparison at\n112 500 r\/min\nPercentage\nEngine parameter Experimental Simulated error\nMaximum thrust (N) 193 189.5 +1.81\nPressure ratio 3.55 3.47 +2.25\nMaximum fuel (gm\/s) 9.10 8.85 +2.75\nEGT (K) 1035 970 +6.28\nFig. 8 Transient and pre-transient on the AMT Olympus compressor map\nJAERO389 \u00a9 IMechE 2008 Proc.

Besides the engine setting, various\nenvironmental factors affect engine thrust. A higher\nambient temperature results in a drop in thrust and\nrise in EGT while a lower ambient pressure results in\na loss in the compressor delivery pressure and thrust.\nThe mean static correlation for thrust under zero bleed\nconditions was within 5 per cent of experimental val-\nues. The engine mechanical transmission efficiency\nwas adjusted from 0.99 to 0.92 to match the EGT values\nof the experiments. With higher mechanical efficiency\nthe simulation predicted lower values of EGT. From\nFig. 9, the EGT correlation is quite good at lower speeds\nbut degrades at higher engine speeds, suggesting that\nthe mechanical efficiency (\u03b7m) may not be constant\nover the whole engine speed range. The fuel burning\nefficiency was decreased from 0.98 to 0.88 to match\nthe excessive fuel consumed by the engine. This could\nalso be attributed to the fact that the manufacturer\nuses 5 per cent oil in the fuel for lubrication purposes\n[6] and a relatively simple combustor model was used.\nThe fuel consumption as function of engine speed as\nwell as compressor exit pressure is also presented in\nFig. 9.\n5.2 Bleed experimentation\nThe bleed experiments [7] were conducted at the Uni-\nversity of Manchester\u2019s Jet Engine Test Facility. These\nexperiments were done as a part of flapless aerial\nvehicle integrated interdisciplinary research project,\nwhich aims at developing novel technologies for con-\ntrol of future aircraft. The bleed air was extracted from\n30 radially symmetric holes on the AMT Olympus\nengine\u2019s centrifugal compressor. The amount of bleed\nwas controlled by a bleed valve and various engine\nparameters were recorded by a data acquisition sys-\ntem. At a given throttle setting, as the amount of\nFig. 9 AMT Olympus steady-state results: thrust, EGT, fuel, and compressor exit pressure\nProc. IMechE Vol. 222 Part G: J. Aerospace Engineering JAERO389 \u00a9 IMechE 2008\nNumerical investigation of engine bleed 947\nbleed is varied the electronic engine control adjusts\nthe fuel flow in an attempt to keep the revolutions per\nminute constant. However, in nearly all bleed cases,\nthe EGT limit is hit as the bleed reaches approximately\n30 per cent of compressor mass flow. This bleed air\nfrom the engine is used to power (a) a circulation con-\ntrol actuator and (b) a fluidic thrust vectoring system\n[7]. Experimental testing was considered necessary\nto quantify the effect of engine bleed on its perfor-\nmance and to identify the boundaries of safe engine\noperation.\n5.3 Bleed simulation and validation\nBleed extraction from the compressor has a degrad-\ning effect on engine performance. It alters the work\nand mass flow balance on engine components. Pilidis\nand Palmer [13] state that upon bleed extraction the\nturbine will have to operate with a lower mass flow\nto produce the work required by the compressor. This\nwill result in a higher TET (T4) and therefore higher\nEGT (T5). The turbine is designed to operate choked\neven at relatively reduced mass flows, and therefore\nthe non-dimensional mass flow (wt\n\u221a\nT4\/P4) through\nthe turbine is constant. To keep the non-dimensional\nmass flow constant, the turbine entry pressure P4 will\ndrop. This implies that compressor pressure ratio will\nfall. The steady-state running line will shift towards\nchoke with a corresponding reduction in compressor\nefficiency. Pilidis and Palmer [13] suggest that when\nthe non-dimensional bleed (\u03c6) is small, the decrease\nin compressor pressure ratio due to bleed extraction\ncan be approximated as\n(\nP3\nP2\n)\nbleed\n\u2248\n(\nP3\nP2\n)\nno 1bleed\n\u221a\n1 \u2212 \u03c6 (26)\nand the corresponding increase in TET T4 is\n(T4)bleed = (T4)no bleed 11 \u2212 \u03c6 (27)\nBleed simulation was performed using the engine\nsimulation program and compared with experimental\nresults. Four throttle settings were simulated: 40, 53,\n61, and 76 per cent. The input for the bleed simulation\nis the actual experimental fuel and bleed flowrates.\nThis sets the engine operating point. Once the engine\nreaches a steady state for a given fuel and bleed flow,\nthe input is changed to the next value. In this way, all\nthe bleed cases were tested in a single-simulation run.\nFig. 10 Bleed simulation \u2013 drop in thrust due to bleed at different throttle settings\nJAERO389 \u00a9 IMechE 2008 Proc.

Even at\nlower throttle settings, as the bleed flow is increased,\nthe EGT hits the upper limit. At this point, the fuel or\nbleed flow cannot be increased further. Hence there\nis an upper limit on the amount of bleed that can be\nextracted at any given throttle setting or engine revolu-\ntions per minute. The percentage errors for thrust and\nEGT are within 5\u201310 per cent of experimental values.\nThis variation is expected since the compressor char-\nacteristics change with the amount of bleed flow, and\nonly steady-state compressor maps under no bleed\nconditions were used for the simulation. It may also\nbe noted that as the engine bleed is increased the elec-\ntronic ECU tries to adjust the corresponding drop in\nspeed by increasing the value of fuel flow. Each step in\nthe fuel flow setting corresponds to a different value of\nthrottle setting. Table 3 summarizes the experimental\nand simulated results for the 61 per cent throttle case.\n6 CONCLUSIONS\nA gas turbine simulation program was written in MAT-\nLAB\/Simulink environment and performance was\ncompared with experimental values. The results were\naccurate to within 5 per cent for the nominal or zero\nbleed case and within 10 per cent for excessive bleed\ncases. The increase in error upon bleed extraction\ncan be attributed to two factors. First, the location\nwhere the bleed is extracted affects the amount of\nwork required by the compressor and this may also\nvary non-linearly for the radial compressor of the\nAMT Olympus engine. Second, the bleed extraction\nitself may adversely influence the performance of the\ncompressor and the compressor characteristics may\nchange. Further work will be required to more accu-\nrately model the compressor map with bleed extrac-\ntion and improve upon the accuracy of the overall\nsimulation. It may be noted here that the compres-\nsor\/turbine maps have been derived from reference\n[10] and the experimental data from reference [7].\nAlthough both sources refer to the same AMT Olympus\nengine, the possibility of statistical variation between\nthe available component maps and the actual engine\nunder test exists. It is possible to further adjust the\ncomponent efficiencies in order to match the experi-\nmental results, however, this was not done in this case.\nThis simulation method runs in real time and there-\nfore can easily be integrated with aircraft and active\nflow control simulation codes.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe authors would like to extend their acknowledge-\nments to Dr Crowther and his research team at the Uni-\nversity of Manchester for the experimental data of the\nAMT Olympus engine.
