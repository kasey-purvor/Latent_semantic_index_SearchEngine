Over the past two years as an\neditorial team we have undertaken a review of the position of ALT-J in relation to other\njournals in the area and considered the nature and scope of the papers we publish. We\ncontinue to expand our list of referees and have provided them with more detailed review\nforms to help guide them when considering recommendations on submissions and to\nencourage detailed, critical (and hopefully!) helpful feedback to authors. We would like to\ntake this opportunity to thank all the referees for their involvement and commitment to the\njournal and for their continued work on refereeing papers. As part of the review process we\nwill be moving to a new publisher, Taylor and Francis, commencing with Volume 12; this is,\nin part, driven by a desire to increase our international profile and readership, as well as\nseeking to have a better online presence including electronic access to all papers. We are,\nafter all, a research journal on learning technologies! We are looking forward to taking the\njournal forward with Taylor and Francis but would also like to take this opportunity to\nthank our current publisher, University of Wales Press, for all their support and\nprofessional work over the years; it has been very good working with them.\nThis issue contains eight articles which reflect the breadth of research activities in learning\ntechnology. It begins with a useful literature review of learning theories and their relation-\nship to e-learning. Ravenscroft provides a review of pedagogical underpinnings to\ne-learning from the past fifty years, particularly focusing on the shift from an emphasis on\nbehaviourist conditioning to more collaborative learning communities.\nThe next four papers report on specific research and evaluations into innovations in the use\nof learning technology. Joiner et al. report on the evaluation of a Web-based video lecture\nusing the Boxrm'nd system. Whitelock et al. consider mechanisms for improving student\nfeedback to tutors using technology and in particular on the use of an electronic monitor-\ning system for this purpose. Boyle and Nicol also look at communication but focus on\n2\nALT-} Volume 11 Number 3\nusing classroom communication systems to support interaction and discussions in large-\nclass settings. A specific subject focus is provided by the paper by Stuart and Brown, who\nreport on an evaluation of learning resources in the teaching of formal philosophical\nmethods. A direct comparison of distance learning and face-to-face teaching has been\ncarried out by de Freitas. She reports on a quantitative study comparing the experience of\nstudents on face-to-face and distance courses, focusing on a series of courses in Geography\nover the past five years.\nLittlejohn reports on the experiences of e-learning support staff and forewarns of the\ngrowing gap between institutional practice and research in the development of approaches\nto sustaining e-learning. Finally Dempster et al. consider the issues, challenges and\nexperiences of creating virtual communities of practice for learning technology through\ntheir work on the development of the RESULTS portal.\nWe continue our theme of responses to papers and in this edition, Draper has provided a\ncritique of Nicol and Coen's article on cost-benefit analysis published in Issue 11.2. Draper\nagrees that this is an important area of learning technology research and considers the\nassociated methodological issues with developing an appropriate model for reliable and\nauthentic cost-benefit analysis. The authors respond to this, agreeing that this is a difficult\narea of research, which is precisely why models such as theirs are valuable in terms of\nopening the debate within institutions and providing senior managers with an analytical\nframework within which to work.\nGrdinne Conole\nEditor\n3\n"}
